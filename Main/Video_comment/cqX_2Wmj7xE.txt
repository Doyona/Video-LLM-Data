NOTIFICATION SQUAD: How much volcano is too much volcano? I hope you enjoyed our hasty attempt at producing a rap music video. Go easy on us! We pulled it off in around 9 hours.  It was pretty intense, but certainly one of the most fun challenges I can recall in Journey Across Japan history. Certainly much more fun than flying in a turbulent Cessna over an active volcano.  ♨️Journey Across Japan continues next weekend! Onwards to Nagasaki and the two abandoned islands.
Missing Closer Line: “We’re not in El Paso, we’re at Mount Aso! Word!”  (And you thought your rap was bad.)
Too much volcano sounds like some 80s dance club song you’d hear
This is really where you shine, Chris. These sorts of creations. I'd love to see much more of your team and your talent encapsulated in this sort of fun for everyone, each personality with their special niche, and where the Broad man himself directs it all. Guess we will see what direction things go.
i really like the way natuski says volcano its funny but also cute
Natsuki is an absolute treasure. Never change, Natsuki ❤
Chris should have sang 😅
To much volcano should be a new hit song if you release it
hahahaah that rap video is hilarious man! gg
The Origen of too much volcano
9 hours you say...That's a pretty decent rap ;)
Aso is dog in the Filipino language.
That’s a very common American bath shape 5:10
A-S-O! @ 21:24.
Mt Aso is where Rodan popped out of in the OG movie.
Hey does anyone know which Ryokan this is?
Too Much Volcano, an instant classic. I can't wait to try the drink this masterpiece inspired at Lost Bar next month while I'm in Tokyo.
You know, all these years later, I wonder if the person who actually issues the challenge got anything for inspiring such a masterpiece?
Love it! 🇨🇦
By the way these kinds of challenges are much more fun to watch than the ones where it looks like you're hurting yourselves, like the eating too much food challenges
Those domes can be asembled in one day. If Im correct it is made from prefab aircrete pieces and it is made in Japan. Dome is good shape for house. Definitely if there is no house heating ifrastructure.
Days away now and in my head I am STILL singing about black tatami and extra salami. Also that it is Natsuki’s holiday: a get away to a far away place of stay. Heaven help me. So much bolcano.
The igloos remind me of DragonBall
The music video was epic.
Just got back from Aso and drove the family crazy with ‘Too Much Volcano’ on repeat. Would do again! Oh, and got evacuated which was cool.
This song still slaps in 2024
Love it! 🎉🎉 incredible lyricist 🎉 your trips always looks such fun!
Mount Aso is not a Super Volcano. It’s Largest eruption was around 300 cubic kilometres in volume (VEI 7) and the threshold for super volcanos is about 1,000+ cubic kilometres.
A S O, too much volcano, no volcano
That shit made me laugh so hard.
Loved the vid lol 😎😁
Those are like the Barbapapa houses
ASO Too much volcano.
Joey is hot.  😉😁😁😁😅
13:13 that the best shot I have seen in all of ur videos. quite amazing
Can we have more with you three please. Funny AF. Thanks so much 😂😂😂
I got here because i searched for the origins of the song. I like it.
That beat was too good for it's own good, Too much good? No good?
A.S.O too much volcano!! Hell yea!
At last people putting wraps together that taste delicious, ps Fuck off Natsuki, me and my wife Kiriko want a hair cut!!!! Love you guys!!!
For the first time I'm listening this masterpiece! Hello from 2024 and it is never to much volcano!!!
This is possibly my favorite Journey Across Japan adventures. I'm from Washington State, and Chris if the opportunity arises, I would love to see you Natsuki and Joey do a remix updated version of ASO Volcano, but with the big 3 here in Washington state. I would title it ASO, VS. Tri Monster Volcanoes, or something to that nature.
lonyoi mok
rap was more lit than an erupting volcano LOLL
Aso
It's so cute seeing how happy Natsuki was seeing the nice accomodations after the igloo house 😊
Best rap! I want to go to that Onsen hotel.Looks amazing
Back here in 2024 and I still can't get enough volcano.
Gl Zl
6:01 im a climber
anyone here in 2024?
Natsuki being an absolute gem ...
Brilliant rap song. 10/10
Some say a legendary song was born.
Why hasn't this been Christmas No.1?
Absolutely love this song you guys won't believe how much i listen this song
a black tatami for my foot ninja army, shabbing round the onsen got me feelin awesome
These videos really need the names of the places you guys stay at, and ideally links to their web sites in the description. There's a ton of ryokan in kurokawa, I couldn't figure out which specific one this was, and it looks neat!
Absolute legends you 3!!
'Too Much Volcano' was way better than I expected!👍
Aso and Kurokawa were some of my favorite places in japan. Stunningly beautiful.
I LOVE Too Much Volcano! Great job in such little time. You should keep making more music. Congrats!
That board that says "visit with caution" but also "evacuate immediately"... but the highlight of this vid is the gorgeous colors: the underbrush and evergreens in your drone shot, and...Joey's glorious burgundy sweater!
Which app they did use to make the song?
Onion
6:27 is that a damn penis shaped house down there?!
Loved too much valcano
Paved roads leading directly to the crater of an active volcano... *ha* oh, humans.
what app was used for the background music? chris showed it but didnt actually say its name
How is this song 3years old already bro
I'm gonna gave too much volcano stuck in my head for hours
I actually love the song.  Good beat, good synths, is danceable and is funny 😂.   Can you go dig it?
The rap has me in tears (of laughter)! So bad yet surprisingly ok..🤣
I love Natsuki! I can't get enough of him.
“My names Chris Broad and I’m here to say / Im going to rap to the beat in a rapping way”
@AbroadinJapan 2:42 “Super Volcano”?  Mt.Aso is Not an Super Volcano. Check Wikipedia.  Take it easy with creaming the content. Try to be honest about the scientific facts.  But I still like your content very much. 👍  Natsuki is a legend! 👍  Wish you best of creativity Chris!
The song I never knew I needed but now won't escape my mind. ASO...
Great song loved the video just don’t give up YouTube 😂❤
What is the app name that you were talking about for the rap music? @18:57
That farm village could be a great dragon ball z themed resort
A S O TOO MUCH VOLCANO
The Igloo hotels give me Mr Bobby Vietnam flashbacks...
Watching this again and, man, this is timeless.
Two years later, and this song is still excellent.
Anyone know where to gey Joey's Area 51 shirt? That shirt is sweet.
That was amazing! I could just watch the "music video/'s" forever! was really good!
Too much Volcano came on my phone, here I am watching it again
Why was that song such a bop? It had no right! A S O so much volcano!
ラップおもろすぎやろ
You lot are like the Top Gear trio of Japanese odyssey!!!
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤😂
@21:32 - Welcome to Dianetics!
I honestly expected the rap to be terrible, but my expectations were genuinely blown away (unlike that volcano).
Still coming back!  Mad lads!!!  Brilliant production!
Which Hotel did you stay in at kurokawa @abroadinjapan?
Some music producer, probably: "MORE COWBELL!!!"  Great video, folks.
The whole execution of the song is just brilliant. Still coming back to see it 🙂
I thought bathing suits are forbidden in onsens 🤔
This makes me regret going to hakone
10:36 idk why but the little cartoon with the "visiting the crater is prohibited for those with asthma" made me chuckle a bit as an asthmatic  like I get it obvs but I'm just imagining them detaining someone with an inhaler on them lmao
When Natsuki is half the reason you click on some of these videos
This one was great! Love your song.
what app do yall think Chris uses for the rap music Beat?
*SHABBING* IS NOW AN OFFICIAL WORLDWIDE KNOWN WORD IN EVERY DICTIONARY !!   Natsuki sensei, arigatōgozaimashita 🙇🏻😄
I feel like I'm listening to Pineapple Apple Pen.
Is this what the capsule corp homes were designed after from dragon ball?
Little did they know.... that was not enough volcano 😂
Music video was awesome
Thank you guys for the biggest laugh of the day… Or the week!
@14:46 scary
This whole time is basically just relationship goals
Dragon ball z houses
Thank you for years of entertaining, intriguing and scenic content 🎉🧡
Oh dear! Too much volcano and the many gases escaping from Chris's multiple ass's are most effective at clearing crowds  even from Japan's hardened tourist places while leaving absolutely no traces!
I'm upset that I only just saw this but omg this was fantastic!!
😂10/10 love u guys
4:57 he was talking about Paris, Arkansas
Better than  Joey's verse on rustage's Dio rap
Great song, A S O to much volacno!
Australia an Britain and America Walked into a bar to buy red eye tuna  A smelly Korean a Chinese dwarf an Russian hooker an the last damn twinky
I have just got into watching the videos you are doing and this one was great. You seem to have so much fun. Love the rap too
Too Much volcano was so good that everyone in VC is jumping out of joy
Natsuki Aso the illest mc to come out of Kumamoto in the last decade !!
I can watch you shows over & over = & they still make me smile! Always ‘loving’ your ‘cohosts’. You boys make me laugh! Thank you!🎖🎖🎖💕💕💕😎😎😎
The best rap song out there!!👌🏼
You guys must have blown up the popularity of the Aso Farm Village, because no matter what dates I check for in 2023, I get "sold out."
I died at “shabbing” 💀☠️🪦
The rap was dope.
is Joey legit rapper? The lyric is low key amazing
Like MTV music maker on playstation.  Ahh back in the day.
this village remembers me of a smurf town or hobit's village looks cool
Looks like the houses in dragonball.
That ASO farm village is $600/night right now.  Probably the reason why it's so empty.
It's so fun to watch how much these guys go all out even for "ridiculous" challenges.  Given that they've already produced 4 commercials and a music video on shoestring budgets, it would be really interesting to see what Chris and Co. could do for a real TV commercial with an actual budget.
Yeah u guys are just a regular bunch of goobers aren't you?... 😂
24:38 / 25:03
I think the music video is really intertaining.
If they covered the houses in dirt and let grass cover them, they would look like hobbit holes and that would be super cool XD
I was waiting the rap to be horrendous but it actually wasn't bad. Kinda reminded me of 80s cliché pop rap commercials 🤣
Great work guys but ... where are all those half naked japanese chicks in that rap video?!
it really REALLY reminds me of mmo housing
Yall seem like a blast to be around
I'm still trying to figure out what Ryokan they stated at. Because searching "Kurokawa onsen" gives a lot of options haha
18:08 this is an awesome camera position, it makes me feel like I am having  a dinner with them 🥺  I grabbed a plate of food too
I love Joey, he's such a great sport to always climb into bathtubs all over Japan. 😄
rap. good.
That was pretty cool and I really liked the song... a LOT. I thought it was going to be a disaster, but it turned out pretty darn great. I liked what Joey said, "shabbing with the homies." That was hilarious. I liked "shabba dadda doing" too. Natsky wasn't as crazy in this one. He was funny. He can rap too. The last place you stayed was really nice. Great video. ❤👍.
Great tune lads. Most impressive. Even though you only spent 9 hrs making it, it still sounds better than most of the rubbish “music” around these days! Nice 80’s vibe going on there!!
Fun fact: Eiichiro Oda, the creator of One Piece is from Kumamoto, Kyushu.
That raps actually pretty good
Best rap video pretty much forever.
That was a great rap even though you guys trained a little nice hahah
fucking amazing song loved it natsuki bless you all
I love yall lol
I like this rap video. Based!
He great song
I’ve been binging recently again. Love the work.
something nice
Natsuki is literally the funniest thing i've ever seen lol he had me dieing the entire video
A true short story : I work as a flight dispatcher, and i Had to plan a flight to beautiful Indonesia where they had an active volcano back then , my colleagues and i put this Great 💩y song ON 🤯😤😂 and we laughed and danced so hard while working . We could’ve done it without you of course  But you guys have made it much funnier and better , THANK YOU 💙  😎🤘
"Too much volcano!"🌋
"And I'll take your mommy on the black tatami!"
Again = you all make me smile!😊😊😊💓💓💓😎😎😎
What is the music at the intro called?
Chris has a thicc aso
Those igloo's kind of remind me of a dragon ball capsule house from the outside and a hobbit hole on the inside.   I want one.
Aso in Dutch is short for anti-social. We use it when someone's being an inconsiderate cunt.
I thought Chris couldn't get more attractive.  Then discovered he can beatbox. If you're looking for a wife hmu 👍
Anyone know the inn they are staying at, I think I missed it
Song was tremendous😄, great job guys!
Please tell me the name of the last onsen you stayed In this video. Been trying to find Kurosawa onsen, but it’s a whole time with different ryokans. Is it possible to sent me a link to this specific ryokan? Thank you very much!!
The igloo village makes me think some one saw Akira Toriyama house aesthetics and just rolled with it,. i wanna go there
Wow, 9 hours to make this music video is dope. Only thing was missing Chris driving by with a Flintstones car.
is there a new thumbnail for this?
Spoiler alert : No spider trash
"Too much volcano" The only rap song I enjoy listening to.
Natsukis voice is really good.
A S O
AHHAAAHAHA delighting music!!!
It's ridiculous and I wouldn't listen to it, but I love it🤣
you should film some kind of fantasy or sci fi movie there.
For the time limitations you had, I would say, yes. It was good. Catchy. I am not a fan of rap, and it was okay.
15:24 Using this as a reference on my trailer.
Anyone else here for "Too much volcano
Loving the content....you lads are jokes🤟
the constant concentration on the wrap song really ruined this video.
ASO so much volcano!
Loved the rap! Drone shots were inspired.
that song was fucking great!!!!
Genuinely loved the rap song. Joey is spitting fire 80s style lol. Natsuki killed it as always, and the production quality for a silly challenge is well above par, thanks to all of you!
The level of production and chorography is most impressive, very entertaining, great job!
Ok but like why would I buy that rap song 😁
I would totally live in those igloos
18:55
Natsuki is so damned great, it's hard not to have a big dumb smile when he's on.
pk something nice about the rap......i liked the beat, some of the flow was almost nice, and there is no doubt that it was entertaining 🙂👍
Damnnnn that was so littttttt. This Journey Across Japan is so fun too.
#Idemandtoomuchvolcamoringtone
A S O !!
Lol that was awesome
Looks like planet namek to me
must pat the rock
That landscape is beautiful!
Aso in Filipino Tagalog language means dog 😂🤣
Revolutionary rap and video 👍
Natsuki is a national treasure - he's one of those "too weird to live, too rare to die" sorta characters, and we NEED to protect him with our lives! Like seriously dude, he cracks me up... I'm STILL laughing my lady balls off about his 'spider trash' cobweb comment and I watched that video at least 4 days ago now... so yeah,  keep him around as long as possible haha xx
Natsuki seems to be a genuinely great guy to hang out with.
You guys are amazing and very talented 👏
If I remember correctly there was a guy who built a polystyrene house in a attempt to sell more on by Disney in Florida
Oh my good so much volcano 🌋 no volcano 🌋 🌋 🌋
Good effort 👌
Okay…but the song wasn’t that bad
Dinosaur capsule 😂
Ngl the rap was lit, I keep coming back to this
If it wasn’t for joey I would’ve been terrified 😂😂😂😂😂
That's actually one of the funniest rap videos I've ever seen. On a second listen it gets better.  I like Dr jelly more though. I used to do funny commercials with my brother and his friend when I was a kid. I wish I still had those so I could put them on YouTube.
The Wilhelm scream in the rap wtf 😂 too much volcano.
Mount aso looking pretty like a painting by Picasso
19:18 Chris: While Natsuki was dancing in the background  Natsuki: Good dancing! Chris: *d e b a t a b l e*
The hook was amazing like the rest of the video well done. 🌋
250$ a night to stay at the igloo place.  I think I know why its got bad reviews
Chris's dream is to direct a movie. I'd like to point out that Guillermo Del Toro got his start directing music videos. FORESHADOWING.
I would 100% live in the Igloo, it's so silly
Name of the song at 10:05 anyone?
Thar was definitely a lot of volcano.
Great job on the rap and another amazing video.
Natski is hilarious 😂
that boulder at 12:05 made me think of the behelit from berserk and I can't unsee it
Excellent music!!!
Oh god, the fucking scream at the danger volcano
Lmao that was an amazing rap at the end. really loved it
Ayo “2MUCH Volcano” fuckin slaps ✌🏻😩
5:38 long time watcher of Tokyo creative, Abroad in japan, Emma, etc... why was Joey's dribk on top and Natsuikis on the bottom.   Is it like rank amongst friends? I thought it was age. If it's not age shouldn't Chris have his drink on top since it's his show?
As a film student, I can tell and feel challenging to edit and film in such little time and with very restricting ideas, yet it was amazing! love every video you do! is so inspiring! Definitely have learned a lot from this video!
man. impressed bout that rap. surprisingly good for the time. i've heard worser
This gives me life.
I seriously can watch Chris's videos forever. the high quality it's AMAZING. I can't even believe we get to watch such good content for FREE on YouTube. great job, man! 👍
What's the name of the app Chris used?
A year of ASO. Thank you so much for the song Chris, Joey and Natsuki!
the song sounds like doing what blond boys do song 😂
"something nice."
Thank you, all three of you.
That was actually really legit
that volcano was a real aso
In my next life, I will be Chris Broad.
If you were to crack that boulder in half, you would have would either an enchanting a big crystal geode or beautiful volcanic obsidian (basically volcanic glass).  The obsidian is what the ancient and native people around the world used as arrow and spear heads, and prized knives.  It flint knapps wonderfully and makes razor sharp implements.
The hidden benefit to writing your own songs is that you can use them at will in your videos without getting copyright strikes
I liked the rap
Too much volcano was A BANGEH! THE WAY HE SAID OHM MY GOD WAS THE BEST!🏆💎
People in the Taiwanese community in LA call snorting cocaine, "shabbing" ... I didn't partake, but it's funny to hear it being used in your video in this way #shablab lolllll
Thats almost like a Top Gear special and i guess we all know who is James May
There's a Netflix film called "Vivarium". This really reminds me of the movie.
Having fun watching your videos! Gawd I’m missing Japan😭
Right up there with "Baby's Got Back!"  😄
Too much volcano is replaying in my head and I blame y’all xD
I LOVE IT!!!! Well done, gents. Original and creative. 👌
anyone know the app chris was using at 18:50
I will use this rap as a ring tone i love it 😍
I came here for rap... I am pleased.
So what's the revenue of the song? No info on Web, maybe we get some insight.
Now do 50 days across Japan to Egpyt lmao. Stardust crusaders, Chris, Joey, Natsuki Ikuzo!
The fact I was bopping my head to the song makes me laugh 😂
abs fab     too volcano too be cool.....sizzle
These "igloo" houses remind me of houses in early Dragon Ball... I'd be interested to know if Akira Toriyama used this as the inspiration for the Capsule Houses in Dragon Ball?
That is a great song 🎵👌
VIP de Big Merch?
That fuckin 80s banger intro gets me every time Chris.
let's go ASO too much volcano, making a song on volcano pit  'abroad in japan' is super lit.
This igloo place would be great for a “Her” style scifi movie
I love it! You can never have too much volcano.....rap song!
That rap really cheered me up! Well done guys! 🙌🏼
The day God blessed us with the greatest rap ever
Whats the app that Chris used ?
love the wilhelm scream
Volcanoes are earth's aholes.
Sha🅱🅱ing with the homies
I love that Chris can beatbox
Jesus loves you all
Best rap video + song ever! thank you for this gift <3
That was amazing
I literally watch the videos just to see Natsuki...and exploring Japan too.
Actually you should make an album together! 😄
the wilhime scream killed me. XD
fake igloo need be made snow aso
Song was decent 😎👌 Put twise as mjch effort in next one and it will be amazing 🙌👉
1:01 I see, Joey is a man of culture. Just from seeing his shirt.
Japan is really a complete world on its own. Theres everything: snow, sun, rain, forest, island, beach, vulcanos and even cider (yay <3). In any other nation is missing something. Makes sense that so little japanese feel the need to leave the country. Big envy.
Awesome video! 👍
I really liked the rap and rap video! A. S. O. To Much Volcano!
So wonderful. These goofballs brought such a smile to my face. Thanks for the incredible rap, and the beautiful tour of this area of Japan!!
Loved it
for 9 hours I have to give you boys props damn lol
Best rap song honestly, Chris Joey and Natsuki are by far the best boy band.
As a fan of 80's rap/hiphop, I have to say I'm impressed. Nicely done! Almost a year too late. :P
amazing
One word... Bravo! I love seeing these videos... keep them coming!
I hope the song becomes a hit!!!! Because it hit me good!!!
2:13 natsukis lyrics are very much like eurobeat style :O
Damn Son, that turned out nice!! Nice Challenge met! 🙌🙌❤️
Too Much Volacano
I watched a wacky weekend video last week that referenced the Volcano Rap, now I know Haha 😂 Awesome guys
In my country aso means dog
it might be cause I don't do karaoke nor sing but watching this made me both embarrassed and grin at how catchy the tune was.
This Rap song is pretty catchy
Your content is better than most of the stuff that used to be on the travel channel before television became completely obsolete!
I love the Rap "Too much Volcano!"
omg, that chorus is catchy lol....great job guys
I think the dome houses look more like dragon ball houses lol
Love it
Lol I really thought the song was gonna be bad
The rap video they made was actually astoundingly good, I wasn't expecting that.
What app did Chris use to make the music?
Is there a website for the onsen that they stayed at?
Absolutely fabulous. The rap was awesome. Thank you
The igloo village thing looks like an excellent place for a Twilight Zone episode
the rap is like glue in my mind, it doesnt go away....^^ its fun thought
I still love too much volcano 🌋
A-S-O, TOO MUCH VOLCANO. NOWHERE NOWHERE! OMG! 🙌🏿🙌🏿🙌🏿🙌🏿
Aso means dog in filipino
Love the rap.💙
Looks like the Capsule houses from Dragon Ball.
Aso is about to erupt as of 2-28-2022
I feel like, given some more time, Joey and Natsuki could write a decent rap in Japanese.
That was fun,and interesting.I'd never heard of the 'Igloo Village'or the areas to walk about on the volcano.Good job on the rap video too.It's stuck in my head.Damn you.
pretty amazing rap about your day 🤔😅👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Natsuki is funny 😆
you deserve a grammy
that intro song makes me bob my head every time 😭
Natsukis got a boulder on his shoulder, just open his folder before u get older & colder, like he told her, sitting in the room whilst sure hearing the cat purr, like we were.
Random thought: I know it’s possible for a penis to enter a vagina... BUT!!!! Is it possible to have a vagina enter a penis?!?!  Guinness world record / historical moment chance  available to the brave, Ladies n gents & everything in between &   Around.
Before there was *Weezer* there was Natsuki’s *wheeze* . Hehe. And *THEN* before that there was *Weez*
That song was awesome 😎
that was way better than I expected haha hope it was a blast to make with your boys
What's that thing you use to decide what challenges to do, I want to buy that ball machine dude
I´d love to see more and more of this trio! Throw CDawg in there too!
Loved the rap song
Is it just me or should they put out the rap I love it and I am not a rap person
The rap song was surprisingly good
LOL, so fun.
As a geologist: No such thing as too much volcano! 😂
3:14 You ignored Dragon Ball?!
sorry, whats aso mean? :T
Anyone else actually love that song LOL I thought it was pretty great
damn good job hilariusly awsome :D
If i sleep straight on my bed both my feet hang off the edge. I just try to sleep at an angle and it usually keeps one foot on the bed. Coming from the couch I slept on throughout last year its nice tho, needs new supports it kindof looks like the deep bed from that love hotel cause 2 support beams have broken. I should be able to replace them soon if things go right.
Actually i would like to know the exact name of the inn, because i have been looking it up for an hour now but could´nt find this one.
i cant get over how naturally funny natsuki is 😂 my mans never fails to makes me laugh
When he said "BATH"... I felt that
great song
Is the rap song on Apple Music? Amazing video
Natsuki is my spirit animal
Clever guys,always a surprise.
Wish they actually put the price and name of the hotel as they do the first camera shot of it or of the room. That would have been really nice.
"Shabbing with Natsuki" sounds borderline obscene.
Chris push natsuki in the water more often...
The rap song sounded a lot like dj jazzy jeff and the fresh prince......Well done gents...
Natsuki is such a likable guy <3
Look like star wars houses from Luke’s home planet
LIKE for the rap song
in my language aso means dog lmao
The production values from the original music to the drone photography are truly amazing.  How many people were in a follow car for the cameraman and drone operator?
LOVE THAT SONG
Man I love Natsuki so much. He’s so wholesome and fun
That town was gorgeous, feels a bit like it's out of a fantasy game
Dudes! The song and cinematography were outstanding!!! It's catchy and fun!!! 10/10
Tbh, Too Much Volcano is actually a really catchy song
yall just living the life i wish I could do that man.
⭐s
12:52 I don't think I've ever seen such a beautiful place on earth.. so breathtaking
rock video next time
i can't believe i've watched chris for almost 10 years and never knew he could beat box
Joey actually has a pretty solid flow, he sounds better than a reasonable amount of pro rappers.
Wooow. Those private rooms were amazing! O_O (and yes, so was the rap song!)
Pretty good rap song
That was entertaining. Natsuki is a star!
I loved the rap song! hahah
You know I was wondering why this song sounds familiar and then I realize these are the songs they play at the gym 😂
This rap is catchy haha. Awesome video!!!
music video of the year
back here in 2022 to witness, once again, the birth of a legendary song. amen.
TOO MUCH VOLCANOOOOO    !!!!
You guys are adorable like little curious cavemen all knocking on the walls going “what is it?”😂
No joke your song is a joy to listen to just because of the fun you all were having miles better than the corporate garbage called music that plays on the radio
I’m was impressed or depressed have figured that out yet. I did like it for some strange reason.
💐 I liked it, well done💌
"Too much volcano". Y'all are ridiculous! LOL
I'd like to know how you get the drone footage of you driving the car.
Little did he know.. this was the spawn of their rap album and a top 14 iTunes hit.
When a challenge gave them money
🎶🎵🎶 ASO - so much volcano - the cheesiness of the song suits the style of Natsuki so much , it’s just amazing 🤩 it is a rap’n’ cheese bomb 💣 couldn’t have been cheesier and that’s what’s BEST about it! FANTASTIC JOB GUYS!!! Great lyrics and superb music!!!   The 3 musketeers of ASO pulled it the right way and style 🤩🎶🤩🎶🤩🎶
Natsuki is my spirit animal
I like how no one acknowledged joeys fakku shirt lol
Too much vulcano is so good, I love listening to it! Awsome job guys!
Too much vulcano is so good! I love it
That village does look pretty cool. Those look like perfect little rooms. Sure they don't have much tourist because it doesn't appear there is much else around there to attract them.
Looks like they camped out in a miniature golf park.
Having stayed in "affordable" accomodations in Paris, I'd say the igloo village has all of them beat, except for closeness to the Arc de Triomphe 😎
These videos just always give me such old top gear/grand tour vibes and I just can't put my finger on why 😅 gotta be the chemistry
J-POP AT ITS BEST "JOEY AND THE BOYS"
The chorus will be stuck in my head for the rest of the day! Looks like a lot of fun was had while making the video.
Dude I loved this series. Instant fan.
It’s all well and good, but nothing tops the “Cycle, bicycle” hit
After the success of Too Much Volcano, I suggest a trilogy ? :)
Joey: I hope for aso Me: ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
cant wait for the album
Time for remix Too Much Volcano
Its not official until there's a Wilhelm scream in the video.
Me: sipping on umeshu and chillin' to  "Too Much Volcano". You guys crushed it! Good job.
Making a rap song in only few days is really impressive and it was good too
Amber warning light sign: "Dangerous volcano gas levels. Very danger. Evacuate immediately." Chris: "Ah brilliant! The perfect time to record a music video innit!"
Lol what did I just watch? Best song
The JAJ group actually got a taste of Venus's atmosphere at about 60 km altitude instead lmao  That atmosphere is made out of considerable amounts of sulfur dioxide, and at that altitude the temperature and pressure are roughly equivalent to Earth's surface, though the concentration of sulfur dioxide is a lot higher (~100ppm compared to Aso's 5ppm)
My mind at any given minute after watching this: A-S-O too much volcano!
Closest thing to Mars without leaving earth? *Laughs in Southern Utah*
Bruh 😭😭
This is one of those videos that age well
👍 So, when song will be available on spotify? 😂
Just realized I hadn't actually seen your rap song while watching your livestream and  I have to say you really nailed it on short notice. Great work.
Lol 🤣 that was awesome
I'm making the song my ringtone
Natsuki is the guy that got me into abroad in Japan and made me want to watch more from on the channel. Dude is just naturally hilarious and interesting
Fvcking dope video! Sugooiii! 🤩🤩🤩
That is fucking amazing =)) Chris you definitely may have a career in filmmaking if you decide to :)
No more Volcano should be as big as Gangnam Style. Hahah
I think the Aso farm village might be a great "hidden" gem spot for photoshoots. As you said it looks kinda like Tatooine. It could be a cool spot for cosplayers to get some cool interesting backgrounds without too many people around. Also sounds like a cost-effective spot as well. It might be a fun idea to go there with a larger group, seeing as you'd likely have it to yourselves. You guys did a great job on the song.
Love Joey's shirts!
Good. You guy’s Shook Aso up.
Too much funny 😅
I cut this off early to avoid the rap song
Is this song available in Spotify??
the rap at the end made my morning lol
Holy shit this is so good
That song has so much BDE
Rap video very good
that song was the dorkiest thing ive ever heard but i still feel like "to much volcano" is going to be stuck in my head because it was repeated so many times haha :p
That song was catchy 😂🔥🔥
😂
the rap is pretty good honestly
What does the JAJ mean? Have watched this catchy tune quite a lot, actually!!
Great vlog, 10/10 Natsuki performance. Could you please dig out the instrumental segment from 9:50, it's quite nice? Thanks!
Thank you Richard Tolson for allowing us to witness this masterpiece
Great video, way better than I expected "Extra Salami" from Nasuki is priceless.  Love it when these three are in a video together.
Best rap song ever
The igloo houses remind me of the houses in Dragon Ball.
I fell inlove with Japanese culture years ago and have studied it on my own for what feels like forever and i just recently discovered this channel and all the colabs and i couldnt be more happy
Most awesome volcano rap ever !!
The song is actually sound okay tho. hahahaha. mazing stuff
That song slapped
oh man i just love how even themselves coulsnt come near guessing how successful this rap would be
I loved the rap!!
I wonder how affordable and fast  these are to make? Seems like a cool idea for low income housing? EDIT: 😳 I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE SECOND HOTEL.
Lowkey the rap was a bop lmao
Natsuki stole the show
I think that rap is the reason Aso erupted again….. too much volcano!. I got kicked off mid visit. Too much volcano so the red lights went off 😬
Another thing Natsuki accidentally rocks. He can do everything in his way and it's fantastic. Joey gives it substance and validates the rap. Chris knows how to present aesthetically pleasing. Job well done!
Very professional... We proud of you guys..You guys should go to the top of the worlds music etc.
You know what always brings me back to binging Chris' videos? The absolute authenticity of it all. Sure, some parts are partially scripted and by his own admission his cynical-ness is somewhat put on, but his interactions with his friends like Natsuki, Joey, Ryotaro, etc. just seem so genuine that it always brings a smile to my face. This channel is genuinely something special
Well, there is art and then there is Too Much Volcano. My brain feels violated. That is all.
Watching this channel has inspired me to learn Japanese
You guys did so well to put that song together so quickly!! Well done guys Too Much Volcano is my new favourite rap song!!😎😂😂
oh shit, i'm going to be singing this all day tomorrow! .  Abroad in Japan's production value  is top notch, you should  be proud of yourselves  for creating such a good series
Anyone see the rust on the side of the boat, lmao had to park the truck in front of it when they were recording haha
So I think we just need to clarify this. Is there too much volcano or no volcano?
Anyone know the music at 10:08
Are you releasing the song for download. It makes a great parody song.
It's like watching Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond, and James May. But like a fun young weird version. I love it when guys just dork off.
Hi
Love the chorus Very too much volcano
Joey's shirt is pretty slick.
The rap song was amazing. All of you guys are really talented. You have "it" as far as filmmaking goes. What a talented group! I mean that.
catchy lyrics NICE
I really love Natsukis Nihonglish.
This gives so much pen apple pen vibes 😂💀
Loved the rap!! Just out of curiosity, given it's offers private baths onsen, does that mean it doesn't matter if you're covered in tattoos?  I've never regretted my tattoos until I realised it may mean not being able to experience Japan's hotsprings!! One of my life goals is to go to every hotspring in the world, so far I've done Australia, New Zealand and Peru. Heartbreaking if I  can't do Japan!!
hello friends
Love it!
Pretty impressed with the rap lol
I literally subscribed because of the awsome music video!  🥰🤣👍🤟
Natsuki is my spirit animal.
Gotta find "Too Much Volcano" on Spotify 😂
too damn volcano fucking hell lets go
I'm sure someone already said this but all I can think of when I see these buildings is the village that Oolong is picking on from early Dragon Ball. lol
Why does natsuki sound this good doing the absolute LEAST 😂😂
The song is actually a bop and for what✋🏻😤
I love Chris’ smile so much, it kills me every time
Love it!  Congrats!  ASO!  🤣🤣🤣
I like vids with natsuki in it
The igloo houses remind me of the trulli we have in Puglia, Italy, they are traditional style houses made of stone and they are round as well :)
Yo, that rap was really catchy. I enjoyed the whole vibe of y’all having fun
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Yup, just saw that Mount Aso just erupted last week..
I expected something worse. That was fun though.
2:17 is that natsuki covering aerosmith? 😆
The rap is very good
I see you even managed to sneak in Wilhelm's scream into the song.
MV's pretty lit tho ngl
A S O - so much vulcano
Mount ASO just erupted 10/2021
You could literally release this on itunes and people would buy it. If you do this you can split the money with Joey and Natsuki. But you get 80% and they get 10% each
But for real the chorus is a bop
That volcano is erupting at the moment!
this song is going to live in my head forever
2:58 i thought was a lot of jigglypuffs that had fallen over
Natsuki is a very happy and funny man
whens the anime coming out?
Sooo……….Mt. Aso erupted…
And four months later? Mount Aso has had an eruption. You all timed your visit well!
But what if... it was just enough volcano?
This song didn’t age well… still goes hard tho
Thank god these guys decided to do this then and not 4 months later...
I see Mt Aso has just celebrated Too Much Volcano by erupting. This is clearly Natsuki's fault.
I lived in Japan for 9 years. This is easily the best rap video I've seen in and out of Japan.
So what phone app is that? Because it's amazing and I want to try it lol
Watching the news today about Mt Aso I couldn't help remembering this video. And considering the theme of your last podcast, it's almost like Aso-san took exception of not being mentioned and decided to remind you that you actually visit its crater. Joking aside, I'm so relieved that no one got hurt on today's eruption. Cheers!
Well thinking of the Eruption Yesterday, there is now defenitely too much vulcano
Wow Aso just had an explosion
Waaaay too much volcano.
June: ASO, too much volcano! October: Mount Aso literally erupts  What did you guys do?
My Aso has just exploded. Talk about too much volcano!!
Quick you need to back to Mount Aso
Came back to this video cause just saw a news that Mount Aso erupted
Far too much volcano 🌋 especially now
Mt Aso just erupted.  It really was Too Much Volcano!
It really was too much volcano...
The music from the intro reminds me of the “Golden Boy” opening.
Great song wish i could be a part of the fun. Someday
The rap song made me smile like crazy so I'd say it's a success. I needed to smile. :')
I'd actually listen to that on Spotify!
That was incredible I've only just discovered abroad in Japan and its fastly becoming my new favourite channel
Dude, having Natsuki just being himself is a cheat code for a great video. Loving the travel series.
Love it! Miss Japan so its great watching these videos. Rap was pretty decent too haha. Good chorus!
Where have you found each other, guys?!🤘
✨perfection✨
reminds me of prince of belair
Can I just take this opportunity to say that Chris's Editing skills really blow me away? He was always good at scripting and making good content, but with the years of experience, the aspect that really feels unreachable for the average peasant is the sheer professionalism and editing skills.
This is the first rap song that I've actually  liked, I might start liking rap if you make more of this. Challenge  make another too much volcano!!
The best challenge ever!!!! Great job guys!
The original Journey Across Japan is 3 years old already?!? Insane!
So good 😊 got you guys on my Apple Music playlist and everywhere else.
Whoever Richard Tolsen is, he had a field day with this video.
Fun fact: Polystyrene is basically what styrofoam is made out of
So much fun "A-S-O So much volcano!" Love it!!
ASO was awesome, i'm waiting for an album now!
too much valcano on spotify when?
The Nippon trio on the hip house tip. Loved that sweet mellow holiday rap.
I appreciate the random Wilhelm scream in the middle of the rap song
I actually thought the song was great .just needed chris in it aswell
Just came back from his recent live stream. "Too Much Volacano" LOL
Best video ever!!,!
Too much volacano!
bro im in love wth the Igloo hotel
its beautiful
OMG, EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDED  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- i got Free Gift Cards CLICK 💜  SEXEDATE.UNO 💜r
Awesome rap guys..
Um.... can I ugh, get this on spotify? No... yes... 🤔 that was  🔥
You guys have so much fun. I’m jealous.
Rap mv was EPIC
Absolutely nailed the "so bad it's good" factor on the rap video. I mean that as a genuine compliment.
I liked the rap song. I wish you would make an instrumental version
I see that wilhelm scream you snuck in there
You guys did an excellent job with the rap video! 👏👏👏
You guys should be vegans 🐓
18:40 the guy all the way to the right looks pure Japanese back in the 1600s 🤣🤣🤣
Japanese is funny in your videos 🤣🤣🤣
Loved the rap.  Well worked.
That damn song will be stuck in my head all day now lol
I LOVE IT SO MUCHHHHHH!!!
This might be the best series on YouTube I've ever come across. Yall need ur own travel channel cause this group is perfect.
Best rap song of 2021
I lived in Japan over 30 years and in my 20s also taught English in Nagoya,  and am wanting to take my grown sons there so I started watching Japan videos and came across your channel.   OMW!!!!  I LOVE YOUR CHANNEL.   Natsuki is freaking hilarious.   This video is the insanely good!   Joey 🦘 has mad skills.   Good on you!
Mount Aso / Catch ya bitch with a lasso . There :) Very welcome
Note to self: sample Natsuki's "let's go" from the intro.
That rapsong was FIRE!!!!!! Really!!! I liked it!!!
The Igloo hotel gives me Smurf Village vibes xD
I Love TOO MUCH VOLCANO!!!!!! 🌋🌋🌋🌋🌋
THIS ONE WAS SOOOOOOO EPIC!!!!!!!
Aso in filipino means Dog btw, anyways love your videos.
mount asso, lemme see dat asss thoooo
Only thing i can think about is that why the FU*K was that beef boiled :D
Great old-style rap, Looks like you guys had lots of fun!
that "RAP' was not bad for not having done one before It actually had a flow..
Fair play on the rap, that took some balls haha
Natsuki's face when Chris said there was a second bath😆
When is too much volcano coming to Spotify?
OMG de rap song by was soooooo good
I find myself humming this song at random times of my day, even during remote work haha.
It look like a teletubbies home
Rap was pure perfection
I love how "Fuck" is in Natsuki's vocabulary xD
Little did they know the hit that too much volcano would become.
I've been to Nagasaki, it was relaxing! PLEASE,  I HOPE you went to Fukuoka! That place is like a second home to me...I had my Xmas and NYE there with a good friend, been there 3 times. I've missed it during covid!
Or a capsule
Those igloos look their from dragon ballz  during namek saga.
Love how joey is just kinda sitting quietly as Chris and Natsuki vibe in their weird crackhead humour xD
The MV definitely makes much more sense with context but it was good even before that
The name of the music app???
i have a apple.. i have pen.. but you Guy's.. You beat that,,,
Great rap song, guys! So much talent!
If every person on this planet would be so easy to please, and could enjoy the small things like Natsuki can, this world would be a paradise. Just awesome.   The rap song is fantastic! Nice old-school vibe, rather relaxing to be honest.
you guys are the reason i live 🧍🏻
Nice rockzxx...too much volcano 🌋🌋🌋🌋🌋🌋🌋🌋🌋🌋🌋🌋🌋🌋🌋🌋🌋🌋🌋🌋🌋🌋🌋🌋🌋🌋🌋🌋🌋🌋🌋🌋🌋🌋🌋🌋🌋🌋🌋🌋🌋🌋🌋
Elon Musk will love it 😂😂😂 Is he a volcano?
GOT ONE PIZZA THE SALAMI TSUNAMI
Wilhelm Scream detected!
whats the song in the intro?
Amazing! I only missed a little more food shots - they were rather repetitive, always the same.
I can't now unlisten 'Too much volcano, no much volcano, nowhere, nowhere'.
I'm only watching for Natsuki, he's too adorable
I was not ready for the level of rap at the beginning after they received their challenge.
I love your videos. The music video was too much fun. You all did an awesome job creating your rap video for the time frame that you had. Thanks for sharing your experiences in Japan with us.
that music is actually legit better than what I expected. that was amazing.
I’m curious to know how much tourism increases whenever Chris does something or stays somewhere outside of the ‘popular’ tourist places.🤔  It’s basically free advertising, minus the cost of Chris staying or doing an activity.👍
Oh my gosh. Please make a video with Selena Gomez. I'm going to have an LSS for a week.. ASO too much volcano!!!
That was so good lol especially for only half a days work
if there were 2 thumbs up to click, id give both for the video and the rap video
I don't even like rap but that was enjoyable
Love it!!
What is the name of the inn you stayed at?
Does anyone know what's the music @10:07
Joey’s actually fire tho! Very much 90’s hip hop vibes and I loved it!
It's like a camping site for the Japanese?
brilliant. well done boys
2 days of binge watching abroad in Japan. You guys rock🤘
lmao that intro
Richard is the true mvp. Without that challenge it wouldn't exist!
I love too much volcano
Rap was catchy. Well done lads!
Too much vulcano.
I like Bon Jovi art music!
EXTRA SAMLAMI
I actually understood what Natsuki meant by Paris i was thinking the same thing about the bathtub style LOL !! Great minds
The rap was actually pretty good, but Joey looks coked out of his mind in the very first shot.
you had no right to make this so catchy xD
Love this episode!!!
Excellent 👌
Igloo hotel looks like goku's house in dbz.
The song was extraterrestrial
21:17　このリズム癖になる。たまに聞きたくなるんだよな。ｗ
Aso Farm Land is almost always fully booked before COVID, it is very very popular with tourists and is pretty god damn expensive too. As told by an ex-JTB travel consultant
You made this in 9 hours? This is actually so fresh.
The igloo village looks like dragon ball
Who ever was Richard T whom submitted the challenge, thank you for sending that challenge! Now its an amazing song 👏
Dude no joke I've been saying "ASO so much volcano" for about 5 hours now lol it's so damn catchy
Love the rap guys.  Great trio. 🏆
Me: Watches video set in Aso. Also me: Wtf does A.S.O. stand for?
I heard this song in a Mike Chen video, absolutely love the song
Wanna know when the Pitbull remix of this is dropping ngl
18:50 what app is that? Does anyone know?
I want this song on my playlist
This rap has no business to be that catchy
The rap was absolutely brilliant, thank you!
Natsuki criss crossing his legs during the rap video is a whole vibe. Love that dude!
how can you say it looks like a cheap hotel,?.. it look fabulous!
this rap is better than Pash Pash
Something nice!
That was a great challenge, and perfectly completed!! Your rap song is actually better than most of what's out there 😉. ASO too much Volcano!! 🌋
you really went above and beyond with this song, good job guys!
In the dome home with the boys, sounding sus
You guys are absolutely hilarious! I couldn't stop smiling and laughing throughout the video! Love it
Ngl i dont think the song is that bad xD
Love the rap video! Haha another awesome video 🤠
such a nice rap video flash news "too much volcano hit the first place on the comments section on youtube!" yeah
Empty igloo village, a stinky mega-volcano named 'Aso', a rap about 'shabing' and black tatami; Okay, I'll be back.
Three dudes rapping in a hot tub. What could go wrong?
fuck yeeees, what a masterpiece
I really hope Aki is proud
that onsen is a dream
Natsuki’s face looks like a crab 🦀
It's a blow up ; - ) Hello from London you cray cray peeps. Continue to create x
Why was that rap song so damn good!!
This rap song sounds like what my parents think rap is
That rap song is AMAZING
Like practically all organic building materials polystyrene foam is combustible. ... Although foam insulation is relatively difficult to ignite, in the case of ignition, burning will readily spread over the exposed surface of the EPS and it will continue to burn until all EPS is consumed.
Ive only seen Natsuki in this and a few other things and he is already my favourite person in these
What is that app used to make the too much volcano beat? That shit is amazing
Where was Chris in the rap song?!????
Funny he's talking about being good at exercise while wearing a sweater that says "WHEEZE" lol
That’s literally the best song I’ve ever heard…. the music video is on point too 🔥🔥
It seems Japan it's all about baths and tubs
That's a w(rap). hehe
Ow magik
the rap I'm crying omg
Absolutely brilliant, I wish the song was on Spotify... it isn't (yet) is it?
THE SONG IS ON SPOTIFY LMAO HELP!! 🤣💀🤣
This is one of the most iconic things I've ever witnessed. This is a power trio!! 🤣👌
I'm feeling Dragonball vibes from those igloo houses.
extra salami ! XD
the igloo hotel looks like a database for spore houses
When Natsuki put the key into the wrong lock and just said "fuck" that got me lmfao
Not a bad rap! hahaha
Should have put the song on 'Spotify'.
Is it just me hearing: "A-S-HOLE, NO VOLCANO!"
Didn't expect this quality of rap. It was amazing and loved the cinematography. Natsuki is definitely a natural Star 👌
14:44 Waterfall Flashback
So much volcano, no volcano, no volcano, too much volcano, nowhere, nowhere, oh my god!
wtf is going on at the side of that stone hottub? 16:40 is that the mat eroded from being too close? that doesn't look good, especially the leftovers on the rock...
What's funny is their rap song made it into the Top 20 on iTunes for the month.
aso hahah nice
Fantastic song! Couldn’t stop smiling 🕺😂
Fantastic song! Couldn’t stop smiling 🕺😂
What's the onsen's name on google? Can't find it. There's more than one.
Great job guys 😔👌✨ Honestly I've seen way worst music videos than this, that are completely for serious 😂😂😂
The quality of this series is beyond anything I imagined. Keep up the incredible work, Chris. お疲れ様です！
honestly i would love to see you guys do a journey across japan drinking special
Capsule houses from dragon ball Z
That rap slaps
THAT was a good video and song. Well done guys.
I love this series!!! ❤❤
Great rap video......much fun
Did you know that Shabu means Crystal Meth in Arabic?  DAMN!
thanks for the trap i never needed, i will cherish it forever
I enjoyed the rap...as someone that never see a volcano in real life, I don't know about too much volcano
Don’t stay in the igloos if anyone in your group snores. We went there with the in-laws and it was like trying to sleep in a giant didgeridoo.
It looks like a town from the Lazytown universe.
Rap Top 100 2021, "Too much Volcano"
Sitting on the bus....... ASO.... TOO MUCH VOLCANO. Eating dinner.... ASO too much volcano...
Shows warningsystem with orange lite flashing stating evacuate immediatly, go on about their day on the vulcano
Wellllll thats not rap as i know it, but it is a clever ditty that i cant get out of my head, loved it yall did amazing
OMG that rap song trumps Lady SoV  ; sugoi ichiban  !
Natsuki-san is genuinely a potential chart topper. He is weird enough to succeed, if put in the right context.
A S O  TOO MUCH VOLCANO
By far the best challenge yet
Lol this is awesome. 😂😂🔥🔥🔥🔥
The song was actually good 🤣👌🏽
Crying I’m laughing so hard at the rap awesome
I really liked that rap and the hot spring!
Dude! You are seriously a special person for doing that for a friend. I hope youtube pays you well. We all wish to be more like you!
I'd love to hang out with some homies just traveling Japan! You guys look like you are having a blast
A S O too much volcano!!
Eh...@10:41 that light said "evacuate immediately"...
Hey, what was the app the he used to create the beat for the rap song?
Those houses come straight from Dbz
Natsuki is a gem as always
The production on these are better than Emmy award-winning shows.
A  S  O  Too much VOLCANO    nO volcAnO      hahaha thank you guys it stuck in my head and I'm going to sing it whooole week :D
It was so nice to see Natsuki so happy! I felt like he finally got the holiday he wanted. 😄
Bloody beautiful gents
Natsuki in trash taste????????
We loved the challenge!! 😆🤣👏👏👏
The Iglu place would be fantastic for a horror film set
YO, Joey i loved the flow of the rap. Had a real oldschool vibe about it
Surely Joey chucks this banger on Spotify.
You guys made a hit. That was so good and I was smiling all the way through the rap video after all the excitement I was building up!!!
Did Joey just do the Cabbage Patch? Wow.  Top tier right there.
Haha that rap was actually great! Natsuki is a born entertainer!
You boys did well,  So a big well done from UR motherland the South East of England  Ur episodes are indeed very watchable, History Geography Japanese hell uv taught me some English But one thing i will never understand is uncooked FISH Sushi aint a dinner ! its a fashion  aah i do understand it, i just dont like it, I like fish but it needs to be bloody cooked? Keep up the good work though, I think Chris is a bit of a UK asset  You do us proud with your Britishness  Cheers big Ears
so. much rap. wow. ❤❤❤ you guys rule :)
The lyrics are awesome!!! 😀 as is the rest of the rap song..
The videography was actually very well done kudos. Too much volcano
The bad rap video needed Dr Jelly
good job Natsuki
日本を満喫してくれて嬉しいです( ˆᴗˆ  )
A S O   SO MUCH VOLCANO
Very impressed with the quality of your vlogs.
Lol ASO too much volcano lol that's gold 🤣
I can't handle Natsuki wearing the "wheeze" hoodie like it's nothing.
Ngl the Aso village houses looks like the kind of houses you create in Spore Civilisation age...
Que gran video love it so so cool congrats volcano boys grettings from Monterrey 🇲🇽 Mexico hugs for you guys
Lmfao you 2 guys keep me laughing you get the cheap cheap your boy gets the 1st class hahahahaha too funny
😂😂❤️
The  song was great
Gagnam style is nothing in front of your rap song
Omg so funny and love the whole channel! Makes me want to travel with you guys!!
Hahahahaha that was straight up epic! Nicely done lads 🍻 My 6 year old is singing it now…
I want to go to Japan and stay in the igloo house
The Rap song was much better than what I expected 😂😂😂 love your videos guys
Hey mr Chris, lovely video and fun rap ;p But I've got a question regarding the Onsen you three went to, which one was it? Thank you in advance!
The igloo might've been basic, but it's definitely unique. I'd be very happy staying there.
I can't imagine all the work that goes into these videos. It is clever how you stylise it as if you're just making it up as you go along but I'm sure there must be so much planning and re-recording involved. The drone shots are always spot on!  I think Abroad in Japan and Bald and Bankrupt are my two favourite YT channels of all time! However, as an 33 year old Englishman living in Hong Kong, I think I can relate to Chris a lot. Thank you for all the entertainment and joy you guys bring! :D
This is the most Japanese song I’ve ever heard lol
A S O . too much volcano :DDDDDDDD
I'm really happy that I have found your channel.  Beautiful scenery and I even to get to learn a few Japanese words in the mix!  I especially like the friendship between all of you! Keep up the good work <3
I need this on Spotify HAHAHAHAHA you guys are awesome. Great job!
Natsuki has such an artistic and iconic way of using the word "Fuck." It's beautiful.
"ASO too much volcano" so catchy 😂 should be on spotify
This rap slaps!
That is way too big to be a Paris style hotel xD
My new favourite rap😂
I love natsuki legend 💙😂
ASO   TOO MUCH VOLCANO
Not gonna lie, pretty freaking legit rap song XD
Tell Natsuki to get a CPAP machine! Especially since he snores so loud def not good for him if he has sleep apnea.
Nothing like shabbing with the homies😅Also epic rap song😎
It was a good rap!!!
Japan is OVERPRICED AF  Once an empire now reduced over-charging for living basics 🤣
Does anyone know the song that starts at about 10:00?
So much volcano! Yeah the boys yall better geddit
god daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaam that song is one hell of a banger
How on earth you made such a good rap?? Also the video part is son f*cking cool
Why was that rap song good?
A.S.O !!!!    Yo!
The song is so catchy 😁😍💃🏼 🌋
Yo. I did not expect that rap to be so good. That was Awesome!
Only thing hotter than the volcano was the lyric fire coming from Natsuki and the Aso boys!
my god when is that rap song coming out on Spotify I NEED IT ;-;
When is the official release, “too much volcano?”
Looks like houses from dragon ball.
:>>
I fear that I'm going to be using the word 'shabbing', now ;-;
Where did you find all these interesting people like Natsuki? He is such a character... Very very entertaining.
Good job on the rap guys! really :) loved it more than i thought i would.
[something nice]
World class 🔥😂😂😂😂
Love This 😂😂😂😂
Good effort
Actually a good job with the music video.
Beat box in japan
I love your productions. It reminds me of some of the shows I used to watch on the travel channel. There’s something great about travel narrated by a British person.
the song had a really solid cowbell
I love this little village, these igloos are so cute. I love the round almost logarithmic spiral nautical shape. They are plain but supper cool.
This fire for just a day piecing things together. ASO!
If watched music video multiple times you guys did great !
That music video was really good considering it was 9 hours in the making and they only wanted a rap😂😍
love how much fun you guys are having.
My jaws are hurting from the huge smile on my face after watching that rap video. I soooooooo love it
That song acutally wasnt too bad! Wouldnt throw it on a high end hifi system but 100% party material or backround music with some nice party feel! Cant wait for a remix ;)
Pepperoni slaami
I mean those lyrics made more sense than 99% of rap songs.
they had another bed appear out of nowhere
"Leaving Natsuki behind to uh, stir his private bath" excuse me, what 😂
Why do you need to stir the pool? Or was Natsuki just being silly?
Best rap song ever! A S O 🙌
Bloody awesome! “Too much volcano” 😂😂😂
I'm sorry. Too Much Volcano is legendary. Y'all just put that together in a few hours too. xD
Great song guys 😂
Lol that song is amazing 😂 great work 👏
Nothing like a Rap Video to " Rap Up" the episode, hehehehehehehe >_>
This is the rap song we didn't know we needed, loved it.
that shit was fire
this camera work and editing is very clean feels like a documentary with a million dollar budget
I love that the song made it to spotify :D
so much volcano
that rap had no business going that hard
Now I got it stuck in my head lol 😆
In awe of that rap
I think you guys is the first who shooting music video at volcano
@Abroad in Japan Hi Chris, Natsuki and Joey did an amazing job rapping, and Chris you did an amazing job video recording the song and video.
That is TUNE!!! Love it <3 :D
English teachers in 2041: what is the deeper meaning in this artistic rap song?
I expected so much worse. But I enjoyed it. Good job boys!
Doctor jelly in the next one ?
The music video/rap is actually so lit, it's gonna be stuck in my head for days- ASO-
Whens To Much Volcano gonna be on Apple Music and spotify?
Abroad In Japan explore the Hoenn Region
So that's where the inspiration for the houses in the Dragonball anime comes from. Interesting
This was great! I liked the rap video too
JJ 2021
Can anyone tell me what app Chris use to make the beat pretty please~
As a rapper, I can say this song was fire. Anime man has that old school 80s flow.
I think it was a bad idea to watch this before going to sleep, my dreams will be hunted by this song that I absolutely love. As usual, awesome work guys!! Cheers on Natsuki's and Joey's acting skills.
I now have this song stuck in my head.
Love the rap, awesome job guys!!!
That rap was fire 🔥🔥🤣
That was so good! Looks like a cool place too
I actually liked this song, please can you make it into separate video so I can add it to my chill playlist! Pretty please :3
Y'all aint ready to admit too much volcano slaps
It would've been better but there was too much volcano.
That onsen scene was a challenging wank
That song will be played at my funeral.
Bring Mr snuggles back
hahaha that was really good rap video
After watching a lot of your videos I am forced to conclude that England looks shite in comparison to a lot of Japan 😂
Seriously good song. Catchy. High production MV!
For an introvert like me, that igloo village is heaven
the song is actually good, wth lol
I was walking with my dog, the sun was burning me like grilled okonomiyaki. I started to sing "A.S.O too much volcano"... I repeat it 20 times more or less. You guys are causing some mental health disorder anddddddd I LIKE IT SO MUCH XD
I love it jaja
21:24  for those who are back for too much volcano
What's the name of the app? 😃 Great episode as always!!!
Natsuki amazing actor, Joey great 90's japan rap style
Catchy song. Stuck in my head all day. No Volcano!!
Amazing 👌
You guys are fking awesome, was smiling the while rap song, keep up the great work!!
The song was pretty legit to be honest
Excellent rap song, well done! 🇯🇵
Awesome Song, you guys are soooo talented, Love the last part of the song, Shabbing ;)
So press I've never seen dragon ball ?
I love it
Why is it so catchy-
10:40 Chris: Just be careful if you have a heart disease or tuberculosis. The sign: EVACUATE IMMEDIATELY
Anyone else just learning Chris can beatbox?
oh no after watching this i found myself singing "A S O~" while sweeping the floor
Abroad in Japan: "we only get 9 hours, so it's probably terrible", written at least half of a full song. American pop singer: "written by 200 people, probably 6 months of brain storming." "Baby, Baby, Oooooh~~ x16"
Best rap video ever!!!!
It's so fun, thank you for this INCREDIBLE rap song x) you guys are amazing
“Natsuki’s created a verb before bedtime”
i think the rap has a good beat i like it
I live for too much volcano lol
Wow, i subscribed some time ago because i saw you on trash taste and i thought you were quite entertaining. This is the first video that i have watched from the abroad in japan channel and it's god damm good
That rap was absolute fire! Joey was spittin some serious bars in the beginning with an amazing flow. It got weaker in the second half but hey, incredible work for a 1 day product.
Please say this is on Spotify XD
The Rap was actually great
excellent song
Natsuki is a Chad omg🤣
Legendary!!!
Lol great rap 😂🤣
The rap song was better than the rap sequence from Space Jam 2.
Definitely needs a B Side/ follow up single named "Too Much Fried Chicken" after the eating challenge video.
This video is so good, i don't even enjoy Rap or hip-hop,but i can appreciate their effort and its kinda fun to watch em...video quality also very nice, especially the onsen view... Very nice work
EPIC!!!!!!
haha omg love it XDD how did you make something like that in such a short time XDD you can really just sing along and get it stuck in your head XDD and that onsen looks awesome Ö_Ö
Pure quality.
I loved the rap. Joey needs to do it more!!!
And the oscar of 2021 goes to ......... Natski 10:59 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 #nothankyou🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Natsuki is always such a great time whenever he's in a video
From now on Natsuki is in constant fear of water 14:41
The rap… best. 🤣
2018 Chris looks like a bond villain
Much better than I expected!
But how much volcano is *enough* volcano?
The best rap song to date.
The music video was awesome!
anime is so fun
I would feel like a giant in that place. I think it just never got that populair among the Japanese. Or it is just busy in a certain season. In general a place needs something else to draw people to it. Like a swimming pool or amusement park. If it is just to sleep with nothing else then it looks people might spend a night and move on. Like you 3 :P
A S O
ASO, so much volcano!
Natsuki is a legend!
Great song, haha
Very ketchy
Omg can't stop singing it ASO love it
That rap song deserves a reward.
The song was super awesome I loved it def gives me good vibes ❤️
These videos are literally tv show episodes i LOVEE the production quality
Are you kidding me man...the rap at the end was the best.....awesome, good one guys!
Am I the only one that noticed the Wilhelm scream?   Nice!   And put that thing on iTunes.
was the eagle sound captured by the camera or added later?
The rap was amazing
Amazing quality on the content, just noticing small details like the eagle screech when the eagle flies past the camera. Crazy
okay though at 4:11 Natsuki sounded like someone else was talking
Aso is definitely a part of the fire nation...
ASO, i loved the VIDEO 🤣 Nice work guys in such a short time 👍
this rap song is so good!!
I first heard the song name to be "two man volcano"
Wow, indeed the rap song we didn't think we needed 😂
will this rap song "Too Much Volcano" be on spotify???
I'm very impressed by the rap song honestly
Haha loved the rap song!! :D
Next billboard hit right here Too much volcano!!!!
Daddy Japan?
That rap video was some badass editing! Nice work to all, and good use of the Wilhelm Scream at 22:58!
that song is ***kin awesome
When I saw Joey going into the hot bath I instantly thought "IT'S THE GANGOOZLER"
Whuat? That cycling from Chūbu to Kyushu was 3 years ago?! Time flies... like rabbit.
12:48 YOO WAIT WHAT IS THIS GENSHIN MUSIC?? club penguin music even maybe?? kind of reminds me of that too haha
Absolutely crushed it, song was awesome if it was o Spotify I would download it in a heartbeat
if this was the early 80's, TMV would have charted 100%
I keep comming back for more volcanoe
Great video
That was EPIC! hahahahaha!
Why does the rap song like unironically work, as in if someone passes the aux cord, this might realistically come up.
I liked your rap....A S O ... too much volcano
"Tell us what you think about this rap"  _Continues to speak about it being mediocre at best_  Comments: "Mediocre?! It's catchier than Peppa Pig's theme song!" (okay, that comparison I made up, but Peppa Pig was the good stuff)  Chris less than a month later in Trash Taste: (Won't spoil, but you can guess)
That was actually good! A.S.O. too much volcano!
Eminem material right there ^^ Honestly loved this rap video. ASO 🎶🎶🎶
Amazing video and an amazing rap song, that was the worst best song to ever grace my ears from a youtuber.
welcome to Tatooine  we have desert volcano igloo you can stay in just plz don,t try to dip your toe in the lava it is hot
Aso too much volcano
Your videos are perfect Sunday morning hangover material!
A S O Too much volcano. okaay it is really catchy. Oh my God lol
something nice. he says. honestly i was suprised by the rap. sounded pretty good. would not skip if the button was presented. (in case that doesnt sound nice at all, i love rock and metal and am usualy disgusted by rap)
Where does camera man sleep? On the floor? XD
I appreciate the wilhelm scream.
Awesome video! The rap was the icing on the cake.
Legends!
That rap song was the best thing I have seen all week
I am so jealous. This is litterly my dream! My motivation in Uni is just so I can makr enough money at some point, so that I'll be able to stay in a room with a private natural bath in litteral Natures Paradise
CHALLENGE: FAILED ‼️ You did let others do the work. YOU were supposed to write a rap song! What you did in fact, was let 2 others make a rap video. I DEMAND THAT YOU REPEAT THE CHALLENGE‼️🥶
Not too “shabby”
hah nice one you used your friends to make rap video and didn't show up in it yourself ;d
Drones are probably the best thing that happened to YouTube cinematography
Great show .. nice song .. too much volcano 🌋
Which hotel did you guys stay in at Kurokawa? My wife and I just did a very similar trip across Kyushu and also very much enjoyed Kurokawa as one of our favorite stops.  Also did you guys ever check out Takachiho Gorge? Beautiful scenic town.
You put a lot more effort into the rap song than I would have haha
Nothing more precious than Natsuki shabbing 🥺
Love this 😀❤ 😀
Abroad in Japan, the only place where you learn a lot of things on japanese and british culture, how to make a rap song and much more. Better than all TV shows
joey shares chris's love of hentai
too much *volacano* bruh 21:58
That rap was a bop
Loved the rap song. Can I download it? Lolz
Almost sounds like will smith and jazzy jeff
awesome!! love this!!
I was afraid the song would be cringe, but it had me smiling and laughing by the end. Just the right mix of good and cheese.
That was a over the top fantastic rap video at the end 😂 Great work on this one👍
You guys nailed the challenge! Keep up the good work, your videos make my days better. 😁
Lol, what? That was actually pretty impressive. 👍👍
Re rap song- I'll buy that for a dollar :-)
I felt like I went on a trip back to the 80’s with that song! Grand master flash would be proud.
I think I need it! ASO too much volcano! please upload the MV so we can add to YT music 😋
Incredible job guys!
That rap is my new ringtone. Thanks guys.
Now that is a certified hood classic
Too Much Volcano needs to be on Spotify
Too much volcano is really catchy, ngl.
I want a single release of the song too much volcano.
Too much volcano
I love you trio and the rap song was the most hilarious, ear-catching music I have ever heard! I love watching your trips cuz you guys seem really authentic and having fun together! Keep up the good work!
I rate the rap song 富士山/10
Put it on Spotify I'm begging you 😂
This video was lovely, and with the limited amount of time you guys had, that rap turned out really well!
How can ive missed this channel?
10:36 I wonder do they misspell things in the other languages too or only in english?
real hip hop
Too much volcano is making me freeze!!!!
Good synergy in this trio!
Best. Volcano rap. Ever.
Too bad, can only like once
Maybe I missed it, but what it the name of the Olsen you guys stayed at?
Basically they are round-shaped alberobello's trulli
Amazing video, loved the places. The onsen looked soooo good! Would love to go there too one day. Also, nailed it on the rap! Big hit!
Bro, Chris this is hot, those shots, the editing, soo good mate
As soon as Chris announced the name of the song and the transition was about to start, I got an ad that showed a house fire. Even the ads know how lit the song is
Nice Rap!!! Good job!
I love aso Nice humor
OMG that was greatness! Great rhymes and the best beat. Too much volcano! Made me laugh but in a good way. Keep it up,  thoroughly entertaining.
Banger
so when is the song gonna be avaible on spotify
I want Joey's Junji Ito sweatshirt.
EXTRA SALAMI !!!!
"Too much volcano" was just what i needed today ... Great work guys! 😊
Been watching for nearly 4 years and I never knew chris can beatbox
honestly for 9 hours the video was pretty killer
Top of the charts … masterpiece
Great production value. I feel like I should be paying for this.
Glorious. Simply glorious. I'll be shabbing along to this song for a very long time... xD
Lil' Anime(ft. Nat-Suge) Too much Volcano. Coming to stores near you in 2021.
I think the rap was pretty well done. Had some great catchy bits. Especially for a 8/9 hours project.
EPIC rap guys.. Can you please ask EPIC RAP BATTLES OF HISTORY to do a Joey vs. Natsuki!? Would be amazing. 😆
Amazing rap 👏 🙌 👌
ASO to much volcano! great stuff.
That was awesome my dudes! Loving the Natsuki appreciation in this vid but that rap song was deliciously executed!
I don't know how I found your YouTube page but I like it. You're funny all on your own but when you add your friends its downright hysterical...lol. The rap song was pretty decent aswell. I wouldn't mind watching you guys doing your own travel show on TV.
When will this be on Spotify
That rap turned out amazing 😎
That was a bop
More songs in the future to fill an album on Spotify!
My first comment here. Rap production excellent. Really impressed for time taken. Only just this week found your channel. Mesmerising. You moan but you are so lucky. What a way to spend your time.....
So... like whens the spotify release ?
loved this episode fellas :) the music video was funny as f !  Thank you
Brilliant video. Fantastic rap. I also like salami
Honest to God, I'm thoroughly impressed by that rap video! You guys killed that challange!
I kept waiting for Gojira or Rodan to rise out of the Volcano...
the rap was awesome
Amazing!!!
I want a whole album made
4:50 did he say palestine
@ 3:13 looks like a capsule house in dragon ball
I need a friend like Natsuki
The rap song is actually catchy, LOL The video is pretty cool too I enjoy it, honestly  My mind is stuck with "A S O, too much volcano" for whole week...
Aso too much volcano. No volcano, no volcano 🕺🌋🎶
that beat aint it chief 😂
gold :D
That song slaps 😂
"Shabbing with the homies." Joey 2021
The rap was so catchy!! And I loved the shoot in the onsen what a funny idea,wonder how it must have looked like from the outside just this casual rave party at a ryoukan
So much volcano is better than 90% of the stuff I hear on the radio...
The rap was very funny. The  rap music video was high quality with beautiful scenes of the volcano.
lol, well produced. Good job guys.
i was really concerned he was driving on the wrong side of the road but then i remembered i live in canada
I loved the rap so jealous of y’all’s cave though
Hilarious
i would pay to listen to this song its so amazing!
Loved the song put it on spotify
ASO So Much Volcano is in my mind the whole night lol
I’d like to point out that the challenge just said to write and perform a rap song, not necessarily make a music video. These guys went above and beyond for us!
Great rap effort guys. Almost professional
Journey Across Japan... always f*cking place so true...
Am I too late to get on the Too Much Volcano hype train? That was amazing lol
Who wouldn't enjoy a night out, sha**ing with the boys in an onsen?
Pls say something nice...hmmm....not the worst i've heard? :))
Awesome song! Sounds like 80ies oldschool-hip hop and that is a very good thing :)
This was entertainment pure. I like your song guys.
Awesome
So dope! Well done
Always enjoying the channel. Aloha from the Big Island of Hawaii with 2 active volcanoes. I wish we had an onsen culture here.
This is my new favorite rap
You guys really tried hard w the rap, it was great 💕✨
Best challenge yet!
Is that rap on Apple Music or Spotify?! Haha
2:39 *Hyuga!? Saiki!? Oh no, my inner weeb is coming out!*
Remix of Too Much Volcano coming in 2022
Okay, but I actually liked the rap song lol been loving learning about Japan since I discovered this channel a few days ago
Love it
The Rap was actually good and it reminded me of the 90s style rap
20:01 joey in the back lol
Dafuq did I just watch. Certainly worth the laugh
Your legends.
6:50 Only 30, huh? It's sad that you put back on all the weight you lost from the first time you were there. Good thing those buildings are earthquake proof, amiright?
Rap was downright good. Thumbs up!
spotify when?
SHABBA DABBA DOO! Shabbing. :)
Why does natsuki sound like psy in the rap vid hahahaha
Best rap ever!
I gotta say the rap was so awesome! If I hadn’t watch the entire video, I wouldn’t have loved the rap so much but it seems so personal, funny, and catchy. It was great! And it only took you 9 hours! You should really really do more rap song!
Such an amazing job!!! Well done!!! Natsuki looks rather fit in the journey... Chris you need some cycling... :P Thank you all for such a lovely video! Keep them coming please!!!
Keep up the good work! Love the easy going funny conversations.
Too much Volcano is the best rap song ever!!   😂 TFS
The igloo houses looked like the houses that Chorlton and the Wheelies lived in. TOO MUCH VOLCANO oh no EARWORM🌋😱
30yo?......good lord.....
anyone any idea what app was used for the rap?
HAHAHAHA, think I might have that stuck in my head for a bit actually. Not to bad for something you guys tossed together in a few hours. It gave me a laugh anyways at the silly antics. XD /thumbs up XD
Damn you for the LSS.... A S O....
That song was…… AMAZING
How many times did laugh while editing that rap video Chris? 🤣 catchy and fun, good work lads!
Too much volcano?!?!
I have already been there.
Stir his private bath xD
was pretty nice having too much volcano
Shabbing with the homies 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣... I'm not gonna lie I would like to go shabbing with the homies looks like a great time
We watched the Dr Jelly commercial! Now we have the rap song “To much Volcano!} Put that on Spotify, Its hilarious! 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣 But its a great song, I liked it!
18:00 Onomatopoeia! Theres three Onomatopoeias, That i will reference here! Shabu Shabu! {The food they are eating!} Teke Teke! {Japanese urban legend, Its a Spirit/Demon of a girl that got the bottom half of herself cut off from a Train, Is what i remember!} Tapa Tapa! {Joke one i came up with to reference MeatCanyons Yokai Bob the Builder!}
14:44  Natsuki is having Flashbacks of when he got pushed,  Into that waterfall!
First time watching this vid after hearing about Too Much Volcano's explosive success on iTunes.... And I must say, the hype was real. Chris, that background track/beat was pure fire. 👌🔥🌋
That place with Igloo………Hut………..House………Things! Are great, Id go there, Its an interesting place!
3:05 Im sure i saw Chris go to this place before, He either went here, Or another  one of these places!
I liked the song, nice job!👌
👍Wonderful Tour !!!👍  👍Greetings from the New York City!!👍
god please never stop doing what makes you happy.
That buzzfeed title tho
it's a disappointment chris,. postponing the next episode every week
Why natsucki got one big arm and also one small. explain plz. fcuking heck. confusion abound in japan. ha haa also please use me. big fan. trying to be funny me. where's the posh one?
the rap was awesome, great work! :)
i watched this video shitfaced drunk, and when the rap song started a was sober as a nun.what happened?
The rap was so good! Joey’s got bars!
the song was catchy :D williams shout was what got my attention !
NGL the too much volcano was fire🔥
Whats with the guys hair?
Clicked on this video without knowing how that rap would consume me lol. Good job!!! Loved it hahaha
Rap was better then expected lol 😆
Doee anyone knows the name of the app chris talked abt?
it says evacuate immediately
The music video was actually quite good!
This feels like a Holiday Camp
I refuse to believe that Chris is 30 years old you're telling me this man was 21 years old in 2012 I just can't see it. I thought Chris was in his mid-to-late forties
i live in a slum can i live in one of those igloos ?
2:14 - Aerosmith is my favorite band!! And now I’m looking forward to Natsuki’s Aerosmith tribute album! 🤣
lol... Too Much Volcano Shabbing!
That was an awesome rap :3 I had to repeat it :3
Truthfully, this is better and easier to watch than James May programme. Lovely job. Will patreon, this deserves to be payed for.
Wilhelm scream! <3
What app did Chris use to make the beats?!
It’s good for time y’all had tbh, the rap is better then some actual rappers songs😂
I genuinely don't think I've laughed that hard in months. That was silly, oddly well produced, and awesome all at once. Super appreciated boys, well done!
above and beyond on the rap! another awesome JAJ installment
So we just gonna skip past the part of Joey actively doing the CATDADDY👁👄👁...👌🏼 Freaking love it!!!👏🏼😂
Great RAP, Joey is really good in lyrics
What’s up Broski 🦋
Does anyone know the app he's using for the melody?
This series feels like a sort of Japanese Travel Top Gear.
A S O
Best rap video ever! <3 Nowhere, nowhere, Oh my god! >< I'm in tears! :D
Damn!! That’s better than a lot of rap songs out there! Nice lyrics and catchy tune. Well done guys!! 👌👌👌
I would love to live in a hobbit house, but that is in New Zealand. So Mt. Aso is just an active volcano. That rap video wasn't bad.
Thought the lyrics would be like No volcano Yes volcano Hahaha
Hmm, I wonder why noone want to stay att asshole farm village.
Wilhelm scream in a rap song, you guys nailed it 🤣
WHEEZE HAHAHA
Anyone else notice how Joey always gets in the baths 🤣 gotta love these guys
I'm so in love with the 80's vibe the rap had.
Best video yet.
Record Deal Coming ?
Solid work my dudes
Love the rap video. It needs to be a stand alone video.
That was way too good
Natsuki for the win! 🤣
I want more Chris next time. There are 3 people on the trip, not just 2. Otherwise awesome
That Rap song was actually good. And the music video was great! You guys did a awesome job! I really enjoyed it :D
Great continuous adventure! Way to go to the group collaboration on your musical creation.  The traditional Inn seems very relaxing! Awesome video!
Always a pleasure watching your videos.
Gotta say the cinematography on this channel has gotten to the point it is better than some TV shows.  Well done all!
Wow the rap was so horrible I love it!
Black Tatami is a good band name
Too much volcano, some merch right there, bloody ace, very entertaining :)
Joey couldn't think of "Pepperoni" for his pizza??? 🤣🍕 The pressure of being a huge recording artist got to him 🤣
Why is this a solid mv
"Too much volcano" is a friggin banger.
Wow it was a great song in such a limited time and i really like joey's rap
14:18 honestly, you will see something creepy             if you try to patiently pause it. you will see the actual thing
Finally got around to viewing this… love love loved the rap.. I think you guys have a new career on the horizon
The rap was so much volcano
Richtig gut gemacht, Jungs!
ASO so much volcano when is the next Hit song coming out we want more love it haha great job guys
Impressive job on the rap Natsuki, Joey, and Chris.  Couldn't imagine having to do that.
That is the best rap meme I've seen in 4 years.
15:46 best footage on this video, amazing.
The rap wasn't bad.  Reminds me of 80's rap videos.
My fave part 12:14 *pat pat pat*
Well done!! 🎵 A S O Too much Volcano 🎶😂 🤣!  I Love it! Cool Rap! 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍 Arigato Gozai Masu!
The best rap song I’ve heard in a while
A S O TOO MUCH VOLCANO is oddly catchy, good job and keep shabbing with the bros
Natsuki is an absolute gem. look after him well
Translation of Japanese website describing the Flint stone Village is "romantic round do me hotel" - hilarious
I'm thoroughly amused by that rap video. Love that classic Japanese English butchering, adds so much charm
My favorite rap song ever 😂
what does A S O stand for?
Why acting like gay 🙄🧐!!!!!!!!!or ?
Too much volcano was really good, natsuki coming in and owning his part in the song is amazing
2:13
U guys made it. The rap song! How hilarious. I put a big smile on while watching the whole video
>w< that was actually a very cute and catchy song
That onsen looks unbelievable.  And the rap video was so much fun to watch.  Thank you for making these videos!
That rap had no right be to as catchy as it was
That song was amazing! Great work.
Rest in Peace, Dr Jelly. There were no cameo or a mention during the rap video. This rap video could have been the only opportunity. I don't he will appear in this 3rd series of Journey Across Japan.
i unironically love the song
Legendary song. Also, top beatbox skilsl Chris 😁😎
Chris Broad. You’re a freakin’ genius. Too Much Volcano has made my day.
Man, that volcano song was 🔥 the rap song we need but don't deserve
Natauki energy is best energy
Nice job on the rap guys I liked it!
Hahahaha amazing Rap video, well done. Joey u got skills 👏👏
“Take it away: Too Much Volcano!”  *ad starts playing*
Too Much Volcano is a great name :)))
Played it in my car whilst stuck in traffic in Earls Court had people look at me like wtf...Volcano..lool
You are doing so much work for your vids, good quality, nice presentation, LOVEABLE characters on the screen. Keep up the good work sir :)
bro gokus house
Big Inn Japan! ;D
that 80's style intro song is pure gold
Well now people are going to stare at me like I'm crazy when I'm singing too much volcano at work 😂😂
the rap song its so bad its good😂😂
Great work guys
Very few videos make me compelled to hit the like button like this one
Love the rap. Definitely a song I never knew I needed.
Brilliant.  Now I've got..ASO, Too much volcano stuck in my head.
Honestly, you guys destroyed that challenge😂
surprisingly good, Natsuki for president.
I always thought you looked familiar too me! You look like you could be related to Elon Musk. xD When you said his name it instantly popped up in my head!
Was that the wilhelm scream in the song? XD
Me as soon as the Flintstones is mentioned at 3:34:  FLINTSTONES! Meet the Flintstones!  They're the modern-stone-age-fam-il-y!  From the, town of Bedrock! They're a page right out of his-to-ry! Some day, maybe Fred will win the fight...
ngl the rap song is amazing. u should upload a separate vid of only the rap song to see how much view it gets
Ngl, that might be one of my favorite rap songs to date.
"too much volcano" needs to go viral! :D
What a masterpiece! Great job guys!
So that's what that mouth do..
I think one of the most sincere things about Chris is how much he clearly loves hanging with Natsuki and seeing his reactions, it so wholesome
TOO MUCH VOLCANO!!
Holy fuck great rap! Natsuki was on fire🔥
unexpected Anime Man hahashhashashsahsah
This song had no right to be as good as it was
More cowbell!
That rap was way better than I expected...
99% sure the app Chris used for the music is called Groovepad - Music & Beats Maker.
Dj.chris, The Rap Man and MC Natsuki
Why do I get so much miami vibe from this lmao
the village  looks like those namekian homes(from dbz)
Hilariously good rap. Well done Anime man
If this was a group project: Joey is the friend who's in charge of presentation, Chris is the one making the powerpoint+behind the scenes, and Natsuki is the jokester keeping up the group's morale
That hotel is freaking creepy but rap song is super lit!
I've never cringed harder in my entire YouTube career
Can you just post the rap song by itself 😃it’s just too good
daymn, the rap song was way better then even some legit songs. Great work guys!
Lava'd the volcanic rap🔥. Abroad in Japan is becoming more of a talent search channel.
Too much catchy!
That rap song was actually pretty good for something made in 9h(!!!) you need to make a music video out of each trip ahahah😂
What does aso mean I missed it
That was a pretty fun rap that was made in such a short amount of time. good work, cant wait to hear it on repeat via spotify
People don’t make rap songs like this anymore... 0% drugs, 0% sex, 0% money...100% A S O too much volcano
What app did you use to make music? Seems pretty cool.
ACK!! I can't get that song out of my head now!! I LOVED the challenge rap video. GREAT JOB!! On to the next video in the series.
gonna be stuck in my head all night thank u
Why he is bathing in trousers?
To me the Igloo Village could be cool to go to with a group of friends. Do like a big scavenger hunt. Do some water or nerf gun fights. etc.
That was so much fun!! And the rap, omg, that was too funny! Great work!! :D
Calliope Mori's been real quiet since Too Much Volcano dropped.
Natsuki stole the show.  He has just the right moves for a rap video.  Great work to you all about completing the challenge.
The shots of the onsen were so incredibly gorgeous. I want another channel, "A B-roll in Japan", with just compilations on unused Journey Across Japan B-roll and stock music.
I'm glad he's happy with the name Aso because I wouldn't be. Think my ex would rename me in a heartbeat, along with a rap and a smile
The video was really good and the lyrics and music of Too Much Volcano put me in a good mood. Well done!
Loved the rap song.  It added some fun to my otherwise uneventful day.  Great job!
Please tell me you're going to realease that as it's own music video!!
That rap is FIRE.
Enjoying every video again as always! Keep up the great work guys!
Jajajaja now i understand everything xD
Something nice
Damn honestly the rap tho cant stop listening to it.... A.S.O TOO MUCH VOLCANO!!!!!!
I can tell you right now, your rap song is seriously going to be a hit but the words need to be cleaned up a bit.
Amazing rap song and video. I was going to say you should put affiliate links to all of your equipment in the description so we can support you when we make a purchase but I see you have done that already haha. Great work
A S O, So much volcano. Its stuck on my head like a sharpie line on my shirt.
14:31 So this is the nicest outdoor hotspring I've seen in a room.  ಠ_ʖಠ   xD
Too much volcano , no volcano !
Calli has been awfully quite since that dropped.
I have to say, that's some pretty decent stuff there mate. Love it
Loved the rap vid 👌 ❤ 👏
This rap song is the best thing since crustless bread🔥
When he says that he’s 30, it reminds me that I’M 30, and I wish he would stop. Lol
Sugoiidesune! Job well done trio! You're all talented. More adventure! More rap songs please. I can't wait to sing along with your new rap songs guys.
The "hmm" in Too Much Volcano is giving me Agust D vibes.
I've stayed in one of those igloo domes. The roof reflects sound perfectly, a bit like the "Whispering Gallery" of St Paul's Cathedral. The result is that if anybody else snores, you hear it as if it's coming from inside your own head. Very very unpleasant place.
Beautiful
This was just awesome, all of it
Wouldve been much better if u let Natsuki sing something in japanese
when the volcano erupts and wipes out humanity historians will only find this from our civilization.
so much volcano hahahaha BEST!
Chris: Weird Igloo House from a Dystopian Society. Me, an intellectual: Son Goku's home from DBZ.
awesome rap
Seriously, where's LOVE button😂
I definitely needed this rap song in my life so thanks
the true MVP of Too Much Volcano was the guy who wrote that challenge
That rap was absolutely amazing
Everything Natsuki says could be quoted
You need "Nippon Trio" merch!
Please travel with one lucky fan soon! These places are amazing. Support from the 🇵🇭
Please 🙏 do not stop making videos with yourself Chris , your fabulous and make me laugh every time lots of love from Danielle  in Surrey x 😘
I ACTUALLY REALLY liked the song. It was kind of like an R&B song 8/10. Just needed some improving on the lyrics and the dancing other than that I thought it was fine.
Great effort team JAJ, much love and respect from Pakistan 🇵🇰
Looks like houses in Dragon Ball Z
I went to Mt Aso back in 1999 with my sister, it was so cool! So glad to see it in your video!
This rap might be on the level of the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air opening. 🤣
All the hot directors sneak in a least one Wilhelm scream.
How do you manage to go around japan without knowing how to speak Japanese
If I was you, I would be approaching Netflix/Amazon with your series and stats right about now.
Put it on Spotify 😂
My dude, the rap is really fire
Your production quality is so good, even better than actual professionally produced shows
rap was good homie, nothing special but given the deadline I think you did good. Especially with no experience in rap
The sound has been haunting me for a week and I’m not the only one #5 on iTunes baby let’s go !!!
The rap was actually sick!
Noice
I loved the rap, it was the perfect amount of cheesy and catchy and it made me laugh!
The rap song was absolutely amazing. Well done for something on such short notice and you managed to get shabbing in the song.
Yoooo, bravo! That came out pretty well!!
The igloo village looks like something out of Dragon Ball Z lmao!
21:24 ur gonna need it haha
You can never have too much volcano!
This actually reminds me of Frish Prince of Bel Air ... props for the Wilhelm ;)
10/10 natsuki a silver gold platinum hit
this song lives rent free in my mind
22:56 That was a funny place to put the Wilhelm Scream. 🤣
Chris's passion for cinematography really shown through here
Love this ❤️
👏👏👏👏👏
What’s up Broski 🦋🦋🦋
That’s clearly namekian houses
The igloo village is probably a reference that reminds me of Japan Sinks 2020 (pretty cool series I would recommend)
"Shabbing with my homies in a ryokan. We got the anime man and Natsuki-san."
Why didn’t Chris appear in the video? Trio? Whut?
I SOOOOO enjoyed this entire episode. You guys rock...... I mean rap. Well done! Watched this on 55in smart TV, not too smart as I had to come back to my laptop to comment. Look forward to what's coming next
Catching as hell. Legends!
the rap song I never needed and wasn't suppose to be good, but..plot twist, it aint half bad
I laugh so much... but then again if you guys load that song in Spotify I'll put it on my fave "Rap-List".
Something nice
A+ on the rap video
The rap is a true art hats down
Those rooms are great! Love the song. Inspiring. 😄
That was an amazing rap!!! Great episode!!
The wilhelm scream got me good
Where can i find a friend like Natsuki? :D
That track hit harder than the Vesuvius hit Pompeii.
just cause joey rapped im disliking this vid. Without joey would have been a 10/10 though sadly i know this feeds his ego
That rap was so much better than I was expecting I’m genuinely shocked. The backing music was great, actually, the lyrics were funny and worked, the rapping wouldn’t win you too many awards but it wasn’t bad at all, and the filming and editing was absolutely phenomenal - above many official music videos with budgets in the millions.  You absolutely murdered that challenge!
ASO single is now in top 15 on itunes alternative song chart lmao
The things I would do to travel around with friends like Chris, Joey and Natsuki
I loved the rap😂
Number 16 on iTunes Charts! Congratulations
Will somewhere like this onsen allow people with tattoos seeing as how they give you a private bath?
"Take it away, Too Much Volcano" ad
I like how it actually sounded legit until Natsuki was like "Oh my God" and it was all memes from there.
that rap had better filming quality and lyrics than most raps released in the US
I love that intro
Two words: EXTRA SALAMI
Dude I thought it was pretty entertaining and fun Rap Video especially considering you guys produced & edited the Song in less than a day, good job. Whats funny is your videos better then some of the big TV programming . Wow is that because lots of TV sucks now are is it because you guys are talented raw talent or a little of both hmmmmm , well keep up the good content guys.
Natsuki needs to say BUSSIN' on camera lol 14:15
This song is so GTA-esque 😂
22:55 a Wilhelm Scream, lol brilliant.
Still better than Uk's Eurovision entry this year...
As Top Gear used to say, "Ambitious but rubbish". It was fun though.
Too much volcano;  my life philosophy now!  Great work all of you.
Props to you all. The song was catchy and awesome. That you went all in no matter how absurd just puts more soul behind it too.
CHRIS YOU COP OUT LOL!
This video was so great. and then the rap came Like a Volcano. It was so much Volcano.
Damn, Joey has flow!
I thought shabu shabu was on onomatopoeia for the sound of the boiling water?
Very good music in this episode! Especially when going up Mount Aso.
Closest to Mars? He hasn’t been to Hawaii’s mountains huh?
That dude really likes Aerosmith lol
Golden, well played guys!
That's 3 mins I'll never get back....  I thought there was going to be a rapid fire Japanese rap in the middle of this masterpiece by our Natsuki.
"We're in the onsen my boys and I, We be shabbing in the banks by the riverside" is fire.
Damn that rap is catchy!
The dancing sucked but u have potential to make rap 🙏🏿
Great job on the rap video guys. A S O
u guys are awesome
Damn it. The chorus is now staying rent-free in my head. 🤣  A-S-O TOO MUCH VOLCANO!
Nippon Trio is my fave neo-classic hip-hop group
Just, quality 😂😂😂 A.S.O. Too much volcano 🌋
Lav it
hahahah this song is amazing!!! also tbh the shots on the volcano look sick - well done guys!!!
"Always fucking place". I need more, so much more 😂
9:24 look at that GIGANTIC BELLY goddamn you gained weight
OKAY FFS why fatso was not rapping. that was amazing:D was waiting for a last bit where chris would just appear as a gangsta brit with his magical voice:D
Natsuki has his own grotto in the onsen; he's moving on up!  Brilliant rap btw. 👏👏👏 I'd buy it, were it to be released!
That was good rap, good job guys!
sometimes i get annoyed with chris and his usual angry attitude...than I remember he doesnt give a damn AND JUST LIKE THAT I'm happy again XD
natsuki’s debut into JRap 🤩♥️🤩♥️🤩
16:39 Gatorade bath
The song was awesome 👌
Joey has some solid rapping skills! :D
i was expecting a chris verse at the end lol, chris is the only one who failed the challenge
thanks now i have this song stuck in my head
you guys done well with the rap
‘Too much volcano’ is absolute fire.
Honestly? Too Much Volcano was kinda bars!
catchy rap
What's the name of the app?
Ppm means "parts per million" just so you know Chris lol
While you were around there you should have visited the Shinmoedake volcano in Kagoshima Prefecture, Kyūshū, Japan. The volcano where the outdoor scenes of the James Bond film You Only Live Twice was filmed.
Really good guys. Hope you get signed
Never expected to see the famous Dr. Jelly rapping about volcanos.
celebrating it
That MV was so well shot well done Chris you really have a talent for cinematography.
the rap came out better than I thought. ngl.
Lol brilliant
Amazing rap! 100%
The music video is beyond amazing, really too much volcano!!!
yeh, that rap song was legitimately very very good. gotta get the too much volcano merch happening. good stuff guys!
Amazing rap
Too much Volcano🤘
The rap is pretty lit
Too much volcano is on spotify
I don't listen to a lot of rap, but I really liked this one. Good job! xD
I need ASO So Much Volcano merch!!! Make it happen yo!!
This journey should be about how many types of baths you and Joey would sit in next.
Best rap!
10:35 new sulphur tier list system: ❤️ Danger volcano 💛 Too much volcano 💚 So much volcano 💙 No volcano
That was very cool guys 😎 🎙
You just ignited that vulcano with this lit rap song 🔥
THIS WHOLE VIDEO WAS EPIC, KEEP IT UP CHRIS, JOEY AND NATSUKI!!!!
Anyone Imagine elon musk rapping like that 😂
10:05 WAIT...      He's not Elon Musk?
So I'm super confused, is that like a seasonal resort area, or just a failed housing development that they rent out?
Joey's dance reminds me this man could slay 100x the women I ever could and I'm okay with that.
Chris you are a shining example of what YouTube should be. Keep doing you my dude.
no one:  my brain in 21:38 : OPPA GANGNAMSTYLE
Mori Calliope cover of the rap when?
Newest hit on YouTube and Sportify
Can't wait to download the hot new single 'Too much volcano". It's going to be stuck in my head for weeks.
Please upload the song to iTunes, I honestly want to download it and I can’t be the only one
The audience is gonna need that absolute masterpiece of a song to be released on any and all music streaming platforms, please and thank you.
EYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! that rap though! Props to you guys!
That music video had me crying laughing. Good shit.
we need more volcano rap
Okay, but why is the music video actually, like, really good though? I HATE most rap and this was straight 🔥
As an asthmatic I did wheeze at Natsuki’s hoodie, especially when he talks about hiking 🤣
From now on I'll be hearing those lyrics on my head whenever I see a volcano
Does anyone know the song at 13:59?
‘Twas great!
Not gonna lie that rap video wasn’t too bad and very visually appeasing to see
Great RAP! But it’s stuck in my head
Great!
"How many Aso's we got on this thing anyhow?" "I knew it, I'm surrounded by Aso's!"
That igloo village felt functional yet cute? It had a really nice esthetic, odd, but nice.
For 9 hours that an excellent Rap.
The Rap song was so fun thank you for all your hard work. Love all of you guy's
I enjoyed the rap very catchy what is ASO? Am I dumb 🤔
who needs the fresh prince when you got joey and natsuki!!
I enjoyed it
I absolutely love Natsuki, Joey & Chris together 👏👏 that rap was absolutely fantastic 🤣 I loved it
That rap had no business being that good or that catchy 😂😂
Couldn't stop grinning during the rap song, just some bros having fun (and probably getting heatstroke from too much onsen and too much volcano). Great work, especially for a one day project!
One more suggestion... change the title of the video on the youtube page to be "Staying in Japan's IGLOO Hotel with Too Much Volcano"
So when's the record deal-
It is already in Spotify ma dudes
No joke, the production quality was surprisingly really good. Not bad for only 9 hours of work.
What's the song at 20:42?
Joey/the anime man has a thong on lol
21:58 natsuki looks like my nan in this shot
this fucking song is banging
this is hilarious and catchy XD
Sheer enjoyment!  I enjoyed the rap song!  I’m not much of a rap fan, but after this performance, I may look up rap groups to listen to—Run DMC?  Can’t wait for the next episode.
Well done gents!
What an ear worm! Great job guys, now I just need a badass Too Much Volcano hoodie or something…..
oh my god the rap song came out pretty good actually! its really fun!! good job!
Something nice about the rap song: good use of Wilhelm Scream.
When you expect "Hilltop Hoods" and get "The Beastie (Eating) Boys"... SMDH. Joey, them cold a$$ dance moves saved it for you.
To much valcano 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
What Japan like for lgbt people
two much volcano is great, i love and i had to laugh so hard
whats the name of the intro song? i love it but i dont know the name
Great job on rap song guys!
lol aso's funny
Again a very entertaining episode! And such a beautiful accomodation! Thank you for this insight!
Is this the final video or one more is coming?
I love how the challe ge was just write and perform a rap song about your day - which you could have just done in the car or something in about 25 minutes, but instead you made a flat out music video 😂 awesome as ever
Mount Aso - Cheeky Japanese.
It's like a magic!!!!! A S O too much volcano!!!
NGL The rap was TheLonelyIsland level quality. Natsuki is a treasure trove.
Amazing travel video but... ...now I can hear ASO... TwT
This song changed my life. Guys next time do a cooking challenge with a good professional japanese cook for a judge, I wanna see Natsuki make a blast of a dish
hi Chris.. thankyou for the great videos.. question.. can you send me the facebook of Shiori please ?
This is such a bop
I WAS WAITING FOR CHRIS TO RAP😤😤
I'LL WATCH JOURNEY ACROSS JAPAN TILL THE DAY I DIE💯💯💯
That was actually a really good rap song, you guys should be proud
Love this journey so joyful 😀
Do private hot springs allow tattoos? As nobody should see them..
Iconic
I love Natsuki's sense of humor. He's that fun friend who hypes up the group. I love it
the mv kinda slaps tho ngl
That rap gave me life.  Next, do a rap video about a bad case of diarrhoea
i gotta ask since norm is the cameraman where does he sleep? with natsuki? xD
i like the rap, it so funny good job guys !!!!
That was amazing 😎.   🎵Living fresh on that black tatami, we about to explode cause we're the volcano army!🎵   Anyone know what that beats app was?
great rap!
A S O too much volcano
Where did you stay? It's not in the description. Awesome music vid!
Amazing!
Just give this song a GRAMMY
that song is the actual shit, so catchy,  ASO Too Much Volcano!!!
Joey staring at the camera intensely before the rap starts got me laughing
That rap sounds surprisingly good
It is so decreed : Every Abroad in Japan episode shall henceforth contain a MINIMUM of 5% rap video content. That was great.
When you have wilhelm shout in the music vid you know that it's the best shit out there 😁😎
I'm going to be humming too much volcano for weeks haha
Love the song!!
The level of production quality is through the roof. Congratulations on being a true professional.  When will you star in a Japanese porno? Its the logical next step.
Very entertaining video! I have been watching your videos for a while but didn’t subscribe till recently. I love the no bulls@*t and no drama of it all! Just the in your face and brutal honesty of it. Not trying to be someone you’re really not. Love your friends! They crack me up all the time! 🤣 I also love Japan! It’s food, culture and most especially the cherry blossoms! I wish I could go soon. Keep up the good work! Looking forward to more informative, fun and adventurous content!
The rap song of 2021! Tbh given the amount of time, this turned out to be a really fun jam!
i expected the rap to be subpar due to chris' words, but damn joey needs to make a career out of this
Joey went from Shirokitsune to too much volcano
Please tell me that this Rap will be available on ITunes!!!!!!!!😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆
I'm surprised you guys didn't just make it "black tatami mat" since that seems easier to rhyme
i'd unironically stream this song
Best rap ever. I laughed so much 😂 I want it in my playlist
This is the rap song that we didn't need, but have always wanted!
...who's holding the camera?
10/10 we need an entire album of the Nippon trio rap songs
This is gold.
Joey has sick skills for rap.  Chris' talent for cinematography is awesome, but his choice of words for rap is D.I.S.M.A.L.  Natsuki was born to star in rap videos.  He's up there with PSY.   Dancing skills need improvement.  So I really loved the video, the rap song was extremely enjoyable.  Word to your mother.
Guys , great rap song . I give it 5 Stars ! Chris thanks for sharing the trip , love the content you post here . You always make me feel like I am right there with you on your adventures.
I just started watching some similar channels and it's crazy to see how many channels are using similar stories, editing, and funny tidbits. I personally think that is the greatest compliment ever...I'm sure you mostly feel that way as well. No greater sign of success than having your channel be the standard from which all others shall be measured from now till clear memories become history, history becomes tall tales, tall tales become myth, and myth becomes legend.   So it has been said, so shall it be.
Loved this challenge!
This music video is fire dude, always impressed by your editing skills
The igloos remind me of the Capsules that bluma uses in the beginning of Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Super Broly
Is there such things like Youtube best channels awards? If there would, you should be at least nominated
You have incredible talent and I think if you run other channels on YouTube, you would also have high click through rate.
Your friendship is magical. It was a cute music video and you guys sold that shit.
A S O too much volcano
Challenge failed, where is Chris in the rap?
Goddammit that was so much better than expected, I might even say that was quite good.
hi Chris....yesterday I stumble with one of your videos and give it a try (I have never watched your channel before)....today I have seen like 16 videos and gotta say I became addicted to your channel now...saludos desde Mexico
A S O  SO MUCH FUCKING VOLCANO
I thought the rap was excellent. You guys are very talented!!!
Am I the only one disappointed with the layout of the igloos lol? I feel like they could have designed those to be cooler.
I just love Chris more and more over the years - I think its the level of nonchalant sarcasm with amazing cinematography 😅  Love you guys ❤😂 aso too much volcano is far too catchy ffs
I loved your RAP
Do the hot springs smell like sulphur?
Too Much Volcano gives off the same vibes as Will Smith's Miami
Is that rap going on Spotify? That was the rap song I never knew I needed
Wtf is going on,!!!?? There's just too much volcano for me to handle!!
Can I find this on Spotify
Planet Namek village :D
We LOVED the music video!!!! Hurrah! We're hoping for more Dr Jelly! Keep up the great work all.
Why is YT not putting this in my suggestions 😐.
C'MON BRUV..... RELEASE THE MUSIC VIDEO, AS A SEPARATE VIDEO. NOTHING MORE, NOTHING LESS.
You guys are hilarious, loved the rap video!
Not gonna lie the raps a bopᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ🤣
The rap song was very nice! love the vids and the bro moments.
i'm a hardcore metal head and listen to nothing but metal music im humming ''ASO so much volcano'' at work XD
Please do a show about the Gundam statue from Odaiba park to Yokohama.
I wonder if his videos are showing in my cinema
I love the rap song!! Very well written lyrics and great video production!! Japan ROCKS!!!
What is the name of the Ryokan you stayed in?
Those look like cheap love hotels lol
Kurisu san beatboxing actually caught me off guard. wow man
Daaamnnn anime man got bars 🔥
too much *v o l c a n o*
actually I enjoyed the rap song quite a lot XD  despite not caring for rap lol  also the onsen looked sooo nice...i mean...I'm not paying 1k for a stay tbh >.< thats rather steep but...
I want a house made of 3 of those igloos attached to each other. Itd be so cool
A S O TO MUCH VOLCANO   NO VOLCANO    NO VOLCANO   (gret job guys, I enjoyed it a lot lol)
those igloo houses kinda remind me of the dome capsule houses from the original dragonball
Really wish i knew specifically which hotel this is
I always saw the option of 4k on these videos but I was never able to select it due to only having data, but now, being in a place with good Wi-Fi, the videos' entertainment just flew through the roof
Rap song in journey across Japan ** oh yes!!**
Fun fact; Aso is sort of Anti-social  or (Asociaal)   in dutch :P In a sentence; That driver is an Aso! meaning; That driver is an anti-social driver! or just in short.... Dick!
I'll be in Japan next year...can´t wait if I find Chris to ask him " Are you youtubaaaa???"...and then run like hell.
Brilliant!
I want to visit a place like the Kurokawa Onsen but my biggest worry regarding all things Japan is just being so far away from all of my friends and family, going to a place like that by myself I think would end up being quite depressing, I’d need to have a couple friends or loved ones with me.
The iglo houses reminds me of the houses in DragonBall. Perhaps one inspired the other.
ASO ... Too much volcano 🌋
Watching you guys have fun is really good for my mental health. Can't wait for the next episode. Take care!
Gotta say 12:50 is just a gorgeous shot, wallpaper worthy.
What is the soundtrack used in 10:12?
id love to know the song at 14:25 please anyone??
Awesome 🤣🤣🤣🤣😭😭
Well, the rap was... awesome o_o I think I'll have quite a hard time trying to exorcise it from the back of my mind for weeks (if I ever manage to do so).
Oh my god I loved the rap so much!! You're videos are sick!
Natsuki’s part low key catchy
You need to bring more often to natsuki!!! I almost die laughing my lungs off
man, i love the japanese people, i hope one day to visit japan.
The rap video is good. Also where can I get those lights
you gotta release that as a music video make it official its to good not to
This earworm has been stuck in my head all day!
name of the private inn please.
Valiant effort on the music video!  I commend you all for your bravery!
I don't know why but i wanna hear Calli do a cover of that rap, it was low-key pretty good.  The video was fun as well, fucking love Natsuki energy
The moment the rap song started and Joey's face came on screen with him in the onsen and that F-boy look on his face i died laughing. DIED. It was brilliant. Good job lol
I think the igloo houses look like the houses in dragon ball z
I missed it, what was the name of the place that had that onsen?  Because that looks strait up RIDONKULUS!  I need to go!
That was so good! Loved it! Hi From Los Angeles 🤗
ASO means smoke in my native language  💯💯💯
Giving me very PPAP vibes lol 😂
ASO
Brilliant. I'll never stop loving this channel!
@Abroad in Japan You're a herbivore...aren't you. That's why there's no gf.
Very entertaining to watch your video Japan is beautiful👍💚
I love all your videos chris, very funny and entertaining, they give me all the serotonin and dopamine i need to make me happy 😁😁👍🏻
Next time, let Natsuki rap in Japanese.  Or better yet, force Chris to rap in Japanese.
Great rap song. Let us know when the album drops
the igloo houses reminds me of dragon balls capsule house
Abroad and Japan band tour when?
When is this going on spotify?!
Loved the rap!!!! Worth the wait until the end of the video!!  ASO so much volcano!
Joey is a very good rapper, of course we always need Natsuki. God knows why Chris chose to film instead of being in the video. Probably just as well 🤣👍🏻🌟
WHY IS THIS NOT A NETFLIX SHOW!
Easily one of my favorite channels, you and the trash taste squad are great together.
Pretty impressive considering the short turnaround!  My only critique - is there *really* such a thing as “too much volcano?” I think we don’t have enough volcanoes in our lives personally. 🙂
Great stuff !!! I'M living in another country aswell Aruba !!!! Now almost for 16 years now .
Welcome to my hometown, Kagoshima!
This is amazing.❤️
cant wait for your new vid
That's fire! Volcano fire! 🔥
hi! @Abroad in Japan . Ever thought of visiting the Swedish Village ,  Sweden Hills in Hokkaido?  would be super cool to see and its rather wierd :)
*ASO, Too Much Volcano* needs to be on a shirt ASAP.
the song was so good you actually had my head bopping! grammy worthy! 🕺
they said you couldnt beat doctor jelly but too much volcano was created
The village was cool, and honestly the rap song turned out much better than I expected.
Those look like the houses from Dragonball.
I was loving it... Then I heard the Wilhelm scream and almost died from laughing. A true masterpiece
Where can I get the soundtrack?
I am not a fan of rap music at all...but this...there is a special word for it in German which is "Ohrwurm" (earwig)...  A S O - it doesn't stoppo 😶
Besto songu des
YOU GOTTA MAKE A T-SHIRT FOR THIS RAP SONG!!!!!   I’ve purchased your “For F#ck Sake” tee and I will purchase another one for “SO MUCH VOLCANO, NO VOLCANO”  Love your content, I watch every single one of your episodes!  Best,  Jasmine
What song is it, at 10:09?
It has been freaking 4 days! I demand the next episode! LOL
THAT SONG IS MY JAM YOU COULD SELL IT TO ME
I've been singing ASO no volcano all day lol great episode
NOWHERE NOWHERE OH MY GOD! 👌🏽
Extra salamehhhh
Made my day!
i got to say that song was nicely done
Wu-Tang Clan better watch themsleves
Please put that song on Spotify✨💖👏
that song was so much better than i anticipated! great work
im scrolling through his past uploads and Chris used to look more like an asshole back then lmao
That song slaps
This really needs to be a netflix series or something
You know who would love to go on vacation with you guys?; Mr. Snuggles! Where is Mr. Snuggles at?!... Now that I think about it he's probably in the shed with the other Chris Broad :(
man, is beautiful place...
I can’t get that tune out of my head. Very catchy! I love it!
Good video
Love how genuine Natsuki is !
19:06 that’s not really a melody is it?
Natsuki's PTSD kicks in the moment he's near water and chris
Natsuki’s charm never fail us!!! XD
DUDE what is it with Joey and weirdly shaped bathtubs. Every time he immediately goes straight into it. I love this man.
this actually slaps wtf
Haha the rap was awesome, great work!
Let me start off with thanks for making this week the most unproductive week at my job EVER!!! I cannot stop binge-watching your channel (at work I might add)... What started off with a link in my feed for "12 reasons not to move to Japan", has now gotten me totally hooked. Can’t stop watching…. I don’t know why… Its not like I am searching for info on Japan which I am not...  Am I watching a travel guide video?... or a food review?... or just some goofballs?. Is it a motivation clip (clips on what happened after the tsunami)? Is this a comedy skit done by a comedian with witty, dry, sarcastic humor, from the uk??? It’s like I’m in a twilight zone episode…. anyway…. It’s mind boggling… why am I hooked on this channel??? Why???? I cannot get enough….Your eclectic friends are so different from each other… Joey, Natsuki, Ryotaro, and Pete.... Such a unique great group.   Thanks for being yourself and thanks to your friends for being themselves too. Thanks for the documentaries… which although more serious in nature actually were inspiring to see how us humans can rally together, can cope, and can be resilient. Thnx.
Banger music xD
We need Translation
I love this!!! Beautiful filming. The rap wasn’t as bad as I thought it would be. I need to start saving for this private onsen because my husband and I have tattoos.
Is Peter Serafinowicz your father? you look and talk like him.   And no I'm not saying all white people look and talk alike.
i am not disappointed :-P
You all looking so relaxed, I'm glad
Brilliant 🌋
I loved the rap, it took me back to the 90's! I also enjoyed the rest of the video too, I think it was really nice of you guys to book that luxurious suite for Natsuki, I can't wait for the next episode tomorrow! Much love from the UK😍💖
Who else misses Journey across Japan, 2k cycle series
Nice Wilhelm scream!
A S O too much Volcano
This reminds of the early material from Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince.
Joeys rap reminds  me of a will smith rap
I've never been more turned on by beat boxing 🤣😂
The song was so catchy
Cool rap song. It was fun to watch! Too much volcano but not enough danger ;(. Better luck next time. It might explode!
Amazing vulcano
this was amazing! i'll have this stuck in my head forever!
"When you come up to places like this there is a degree of risk but, you know, we've got a rap song to make"
That rap is now stuck in my head
Haha loved the energy of the song and the built up to it. What’s the music scene like in Japan and are jam seshes easy to find?
FINALLY A REAL BANGER
Aso means Dog in the Philippines.... Shabu means illegal drugs in the Philippines...
wish me and the bois could do this trip too someday!
I do not like rap but the energy, choreography, and effort was evident.
hahahaha 😂😂 this is too good
The song was really good!!!
Why in the world Abroad in Japan are not featured in national television. This is gold!
Too much volcano
How have I been subbed for the last... 5 odd years and not known that Chris can beatbox?
Aso is awesome! Maybe it's just me, but I have lived in Kumamoto for 3 years now and never heard of or seen that igloo village. Maybe they don't advertise so well? Or everyone just flocks past to Kurokawa and all the other nice places in the area.
That hot spring looks amazing at the Inn.
Welp, I'm going to have "Too Much Volcano" stuck in my head for quite a bit. It's a good one.
I love seeing that the guys had fun creating this rap. I like it. Any chance to make a ringtone out of this? XD
give this trio an award
OH NOOOOOOOOO. it's playing in my head
Best rap video every guys lol. A S O 🙌 to much volcano 🌋 👏 🙌 ✨
Honestly, not that bad...        "Too much Volcano"
I think we need a Rap Video from each location ... A.S.O. Too much Rap Video.
I feel the Dr. Jelly vibes in the rap
This should become a tv show series or something, the man literally deserves an award.
Seeing joey rap brings me so much joy!!
Too much volcano 👍🏻👍🏻
This is Gold in every way
I NEED THAT APP THAT CHRIS USES TO MAKE BEEPS AND BOOPS
When that beat is better than that of the vast majority of million dollar rap songs these days. I like the the oldies disco influences.
Epic rap battles of history better watch there buts! they got some Competition! XD
10:40 seems like you might want to "evacuate immediately" as suggested...
That song's beat is great considering Chris made it on his phone in <9 hours.
I believe your videos will erupt crazily if every video you create, have a music video 🤣
That was a better rap video than others I've seen. Honestly enjoyed it!
Those little houses remind me of the villages in OG Dragon Ball
"A. S. O, too much volcano no volcano, no volcano."  This line is now engraved into my mind, heart and soul.
Loved the creativity that went into this video.
A S O!
...8:51 - the beds were "a bit hard" in that place, well they DO LOOK a village from the flintstones!, beds are probably made to feel like a ROCK!!
Joey kinda looks like my ex and idk how to feel about it
Enjoyed the in depth look of places I was curious about since the first Journey Across Japan trip. The volcano planes also reminded me of some anime scenes. I think it's fair to say that the rap song would be welcome on anyone's car radio. Extra salami!
You guys are just too cute, I love these videos 😊
I expect to see pizza with extra salami in a later video and a throwback to this song
ASO power! hahahahah
Anyone else see the cool red rock at 8:54?
I actually really enjoyed it and I normally don't like rap music, it was both hilarious and well thought out!
Hey bro im from Jamaica  been watching your videos for the pass 3 years dont normally comment but want say i always enjoy your videos not just entertaining but very informative. Thanks for the hard work you put in. Keep smashing it by the way the rap video you guys made was amazing .you are going to start aaking for a rap for each video . Stay blessed bro
At least the video work on the rap song was good xD  10/10
I'm liking the song :D
Actualy not shsbby
That rap video was amazing. XD
Mt asshole ?
It was really good and i want it
T O O M U C H V O L C A N O
Loved the Rap song 😂
Too many dislikes
That song... Lit! I'd appreciate if you could send the vocals to my email. A remix out of it would be lit too, but not on the same level.  Great video as always!
HELP ANYONE I WANT TO WATCH THE SERIES IN THE RIGHT ORDER SO I DON'T MISS ANYTHING. PLEASE TELL ME
Anyone catch that Wilhelm Scream? Lol.
I bet no one will get this obscure reference but identical 'igloo' village was portrayed in PS1 Japanese game Legend of Dragoon from year 2000
to come up with the lyrics, film it and edit it within that day or the 9 hours (even if lyrics etc weren't thaaat much) is actually incredible, you gotta be creative to whip something up like this on the fly
That was an enjoyable rap video:)
Reminds me of lazy town
please put the rap on Spotify 😭😂
Joey: You can beatbox...  Me. BEATBOX???  Cue Chris actually beatboxing and me losing my mind lol
Dear YouTube algorithm: Just because I'm an bloody idiot and I didn't watch this when it aired on Sunday, it doesn't mean that I don't *want* to watch it! Please don't throw this legend's hard work down the toilet! Sincerely, one of his subscribers! Thank you Chris, this is amazing! :D
Nice Rap 👍
Lads! The rap was quality 😂😂😂, loved it. All the Natsuki all the time please 😆
The Will Smith vibes are strong with this one 😄 really good job you guys are a joy to watch.
Ok, those were bars! Crispy bars and where is the iTunes download? I’ll play a solid $1.29 for that hot single
help the song is stuck in my head
Single when? :')
Would you be willing to look at something for me and translate or know someone that would? Nothing big or long, just the symbols on the hilt of a possible WW2 sword?
Just me tripping or does the igloo village look like the houses in the og dragon ball series?
That's going to be stuck in my head for the next week! A-S-O
Natsuki is so freaking cool man
I love how weary Natsuki is when you show him around the onsen room, like he can't believe something isn't hiding the bath
That rap song was wicked
The Wilhelm scream after danger volcano had me dead 😂
What happened to you? You looks awfully old. Too much sex? Or drink too much ?
For only 9 hours that is impressive creativity guys!
Let's make too much volcano Christmas number one!
Omg natsuki’s hook 🤣🤣
🤣🤣 that natsuki’s let’s go before the beat dropped
Song of summer 2021
Did sound like a**hole a couple of times
Joey: that’s a weird bath tub  *gets in bath tub and just sits* 😂
Chris can beat box... WHAT??? 😂
I'm impressed!! I loved it and i can tell you enjoyed doing it!
21:24 I know you came here for this
You guys are hilarious 🤣 I am seriously obsessed with your channel now and hope to get to Japan one day
Great job guys!
I like it when the seatbelt shows us his tummy
Damn I was viking to that Jam of yours. Joey stole the show 😁❤❤
Natsuki The climber😉
Fuck!!! Now i gotta get me a "Wheeze" hoodie!
Y’all should not have inhaled that stuff 😆😆 — yellow warning light legit advised people to evacuate immediately
Amazing rap. Loving these longer videos as well. Can't wait for the series to continue
ive just come to the conclusion that joey and chris like bathing together, not in a weird way or anything, strictly platonic bathing
The rap song was fire 🔥 🔥 🔥
What's the music at 10:00? Asking for Reddit.
Dude why was that music video actually pretty catchy?!?!?! Wtf guys?
LOL, LOL and LOL!. Congrats to all you guys; you made my day!. The rap video is very nice. An instant classic for the channel!. Always eager to see more videos!. Take care!
Should upload the song separately so I can keep looping it 🌞
Okay, I demand that y'all have a summary singalong at the end of all of your travel videos. Volcano song was dope!
I love the rap song but the 90s called and they want it back
Great video! Well done Chris, I enjoyed it!
Great rap should of used for eruovision might of got more than 0 😱 Great beat loved it well done guy's 👏✔ 😀😍💙💙💙🚙🌋🗼⛩XXXXX
New solo single coming to Joey's channel soon: Jelly Volcano
Would be great if this has a Netflix Documentary.
Can some one tell me whats the name of the song in the background, it starts at 2:39min??? :)
What is the background music from 9:50 and the drone footage over the volcano craters anyone? Epic shots paired with epic music!
😂 smashed it lads
That was amazing lol loved the rap
21:54 thought the applebee's commercial that came on was the rap for a second
Definitely a fun view
Wait.. why is Natsuki using a broom on the onsen? LMFAO
the sign says at 2ppm what to do evacuate, Chris and the rest lets go inhale the Sulphur cloud.. edit also a shame you didnt show more footage of that onseen like the surrounding area
I live in cenral Europe and we have 30 fucking degrees Celsius here, so wathcing you guys in a freaking onsen isn't really pleasant to watch. 😅🥵
Surprisingly pretty good
Love the video.....but that song is hot garbage. Joeys done much better.
Great guys, no less than dr. Dre stuff right here 😂😎
Im adding this to my Spotify playlist 100%
ASO - so much volcano
Who the heck did the edit for the music video? So freaking good!
Rap was fucking amazing haha
Aw why leave natsuki all alone. That's sad
Okay but... why was “too much volcano” an instant classic?!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️
Tbh I'd be happy if they did this challenge every time, it was awesome!
Probably not quite the type of video that people may have filmed in those baths.
omg I love it 😂
I am a simple man I see Natsuki I watch it
Another tiptop video Chris and the gang! The song was fantastic too haha.  Looking forward to the next episode!
Petition to make "Too Much Volcano" rap song of the year
Natsuki with his own personal grotto.
The houses look like out of OG Dragon Ball, lol.
I want a name for the band that debuted in this video, and I WANT THEIR MERCH
21:24 Grammy material right here ❤️❤️😎
Best rap video ever!
16:50 for a split second i though Joey was wearing a thong.
Such a scam chris wasnt in the mv
Honestly really, really enjoyed the rap video. Folks have commented on the lyrics and the mix, but I must say the video is quite beautifully done. Good work!
goddamn, these guys are hilarious!
I genuinely can not believe that journey across japan was three years ago!?!?! It feels like it happened a year ago. Like i was watching each episode and then wondering why u were not uploading daily lol. Damn…. Three years ago
Awesome! You guys did a good job on the rap video.
You guys did such a great job on the rap! 😆 It’s very catchy! Joey and Natsuki are a great duo, but next time Chjris has to make an appearance lol 👌💜✨
what's the name of the app he used to make the music?
just love this! LOVE
job well done fo sho!
Wish I could go with my buds to a journey across japan. You've got it all sorted out Chris. :)
too much volcano, nowhere, omg
Great job guys!
Too Much Volcano rocks, but where is Chris' beatboxing? The little taste he gave us was not enough! I demand a Part Two!
Next year I want to see "Belly Across Japan" eating in all the prefectures
The rap was actually A tier. Did not really expect be that good, props to you guys.
I must say I really enjoyed the rap video, everything blended in perfect and it was fun to watch. I just want to say thank you for all the content you make, I have never been to Japan but since I was a child I have always been wanting to go. I love the Japanese culture and because of your channel I have a list of places I must see so thank you! Wishing you and the crew the best in life!
https://youtu.be/e-jE1Uq619I
ngl, that rap was kinda fire lads, gj !
I thought nothing could beat Dr. Jelly ad... I was wrong  A S O.. TOO MUCH VOLCANO
Thank you for taking us along on Natsuki’s holiday.  So much fun.  Your rap song reliably makes me smile.
"Too much volcano" are the greatest words put together
Well let's just be happy that Shabu Shabu is not called Shagu Shagu
The Rap was actually good lyrics weren’t bad and the editing was really good, well done!  I’m disappointed though, I wanted it to be crappy, so it would be funny.
An Aussie rapping in Japan with an American accent. I'll give it a strong pass lol
ASO NOT ENOUGH VOLCANOOO WE NEED MORE
This makes me insanely mad. Perfection of the combination of audio and visuals has been captured in a slice of time of duration 25 minutes and it only has 700k views???
The rap was okay! Did a great job, it was bizarre but awesome fun at the same time XD
Not a rap guy but was great.
The rap song is already stuck in my head and CAN’T GET IT OUT!!!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
All things considered... that rap was brilliant. Too much volcano, Natsuki is a genius.
TOO MUCH VOLCANO, NO VOLCANO, NOWHERE, NOWHERE, OH MY GOD IS THE CATCHIEST CHORUS I'VE EVER HEARD
Well, there you go, Doctor Jelly got into rap, and this is what we get. Got admit that was actually lit. Well done boys.
PLEASE LOVE ME  LOVE THE WAY YOU LIE BY RIHANNA N EMINEM RIRI WENT TO D SAME SCHOOL AS U YH - daughter yh any pet name u cool chillax bredrin yh yh no more skin cancer beach babes hackers*
Great rap video done in a day, when you were also doing so much else! Good effort..
These visuals are insane! Also Joey's dance here 23:15
I've always wanted to go to a traditional hot spring town in Japan however I have tattoos so I wont be allowed in many places as tattoos are taboo in Japan still 😔
The song should be on Spotify
Thank goodness for a good editor, someone needs a raise!
too much volcano, yet no volcano, Does Natsuki Do Philosophy
amazing song
Awesome guys 🔥😃🙌
Why does Joey consistently wear clothing that advertises a Hentai site? :D
Their chaotic energy is way too entertaining
Song's lit af tho
What you on about mate thats an amazing rap song
My man, your videos are so well produced and really fun to watch..also, Natsuki is a gem of a human-being...you are lucky to have a friend like him!!! keep up the awesome work Chris!!!
This was so good guys 😂😂 loved it.
I love volcanoes so i don't subscribe to the idea of too much of them, but i legitimately enjoyed the rap regardless, good work guys
What a fun video! Well done Chris, Joey, Natsuki and the team!
Love how Chris managed to not be in the rap video lol
A surprisingly good rap song. ;)
There’s never too much volcano
How do you manage to do your laundry is such a small apartment..? Do you go to a funky laundrette, if so can you find one. Cheers
my face is hurting from watching this vid, is this okay? X'D
I can't believe how much you guys did in one day... sensational work on everything!
What rhymes with Tatami......somehow you got to salami and pastrami before finding Origami? C'mon guys you all speak Japanese ahahah
how to love a rap song if you don't like rap? Abroad in Japan! I WANT THIS SONG xD
You guys made up for the first challenge failure,
A S O
I never want Journey across Japan to end!! :(((  Well done guys, fun and entertaining as always and the footage, the scenery - to die for! <3 later edit: keep coming to listen to the song ahahahha - too much volcano!
Classic video. Thank you for the hard work put into this!
I'm afraid this is such an earworm that I'll humm it on the subway and people will call an embulance because they think I should be taken to an asylum🤣 but honestly, the song is really catchy and the video is suuper well done. that challenges is more than just completed!
So... Dr Stone took place east of mount Aso?
I fucking love the volcano song hahahah this is great
I saw the music video first with no context, it still doesn't make any sense, but I think that actually helps! This is shaping up to be an awesome series already!
That place looks familiar hmmmm I've seen it on Japan Sinks
Black tatami and Kami were a missed opportunity, chilling on the black tatami, just like a kami, feeling lit, feeling light, Naski here, time to fight.
You guys are going to have to write a sea shanty.
The fact that the music video was made in a day is ridiculous for its quality.
The rap is kinda nice. Respect. It just seems super fun. X,D
I want this song on Apple Music 🤩
yo that song actually slaps
Quality content 😂🤣👍
love yall
AWESOME SONG! Thank you all very much for bringinh so much fun all the way to switzerland! CheesyXChoclate kiss
I hope aliens see this rap video
i don't usually comment but i couldn't stop smiling through that rap song. it really brightened up my evening. agreeing with other commentors that the chorus lines would make a great shirt! but seriously i always enjoy your videos, thank you all!
that rap was actually amazing lmao
I was expecting the rap song to be lol bad, but it ended up being pretty good and catchy! Impressive! I’ve seen so much worse from “professionals”
#ASOTooMuchVolcano 👍 Just brilliant 👏👌😀👍
Chris should be on the Too Much Volcano Remix
Looking forward to seeing what type of bathtub Joey or Natsuki appear in on the next episode.
The best part is the instant contradiction.... so much volcano, no volcano
Wow, so cool to stay in Japanese igloo village. Until you realize it’s not and it just gets weird and creepy 😬
The song is an absolute masterpiece
You have the best job!
So, where  did the cameraman sleep!?
i dont like rap but damn this song was good for sure
Ngl it was a bop
Was that a Wilhelm scream? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_scream
I'm confused, is it too much volcano or not enough volcano?
ASO too much volcano is my new jam
Is the rap on iTunes orrrrrr
This is fantastic Chris! I think I’m obsessed with your editing style!
That has to be the best rap I’ve seen on this channel so far
I’ll keep it real. I had to go to a Kendrick Lamar video to remind myself what good rap sounds like. BUT!, you guys are pretty good for an old ass beat.
AWESOME!
You guys are legends around the world Legitimately
ASO too much volcano
that was disturbingly good for an amateur attempt.
🙌I’m always impressed with the cinematography of his videos, is not for YouTube is more for the big screen
Nice Rap ^_^ 10 out of 10
NO VOLCANO . . . . . . . literally in VOLCANO
Hey at 1.5x speed that rap song SLAPS, YO
Damn! That song is actually pretty good. I’m impressed. Definitely would download on itunes if it was there. Nice job!
When can we purchase Too Much Volcano merch?
Just love it!!!! Best Rap song ever!!!!!!
This song has no business being this good
Shout out to The Shabbing Boys!! Well done Natsuki, Joey, Chris and the JAJ team!
Next challenge must say "create a rap song about your day and include Chris"
Natsuki reminds me of Robin Williams. He’s “always on.”
Wow Joey I didn’t expect you to spit the rap part so hard 😎
just me or does Natsuki be sounding EXACTLY like my man chabuddy g's track peanut dust from people just do nothing??
Amazing rap vid.
As an introvert who would love to live alone in a small, isolated hut with a cat... that farm village sounds perfect for me.
When can we purchase a single of this great song
Loving the WHEEZE sweatshirt
I'm feelin' the heat from this volcano!  But I need to feel like I'm burning...  MORE COWBELL!!!  As an aside, the Wilhelm scream was a nice touch.
This was AWESOME
great song! but ... I like my pizza with extra wasabi!
Where can I get myself some lights like that? Those would be so fun to use.
I be sitting on, Black Tatami, - got the heater on me, from Aso the heat flow, shab it with pastrami. living in the hard dome, feeling kinda hol-low, sinking in the waters so dark-call it Kuro Me and the boys, we be three in tow, now this bath so long need a boat and row-  man these fumes got me dizzy and im feeling slow and we take it back to start shabbing with these hoes.
Too much volcano 🌋. That song was an explosion of _______.
joey the animation man
What's the app name that they made the beats with
👏👍
This is where you're wrong Joey, Souja boi did it first.
We need a Natsuke album!
Great video, and great rap.
The amount of production time put into Too Much Volcano is terrifying, great work guys!
10:12 what song is that?
Okay but why does the rap song actually slap so hard lol
That song is catchy!
There are moments when you think to yourself that creators on YouTube are a hundred times more interesting to watch than regular tv. I thank you for my viewing pleasure.
A.S.O TOO MUCH VOLCANO
10:54 you forgot covid 19
Lol long time watcher, first time commenter cause that rap song was fucckken awesome!!!
Cool Morrowind tour guys
OMG.  Loved it.   Made my day.
That song was pretty fire
That was a very good job that rap considering short time given. Good job. Nice to watch.
As a guitarist who’s played more than half their life, too much volcano was pretty sly and groovy, Chris did great with the mix and Joey has some good flow!
Joey's got the dancing skills of my 92 year old dying grandpa
Natsuki is the most hilarious guy I’ve ever seen
Might wanna check the spelling : "Volacano"
business in the front, too much volcano in the back 🌋
With how much Natsuki mentions things are too cramped or tiny like the car previously -- does he live in a mansion in japan? That or I'm picturing him to have a huge open room western style house now!
Man that rap was flipping amazing
I'm rewatching this video, again
Hey! We going to Tokyo from Liverpool in February to celebrate my birthday! You are more than welcome and invited to come for a drinks! And if you want something for England (everything except marmite) let me know!
Excellent episode and did I hear the Wilhelm Scream during the rap video?
That rap was actually amazing
Watching these videos just makes me happy😊. Amazing quality, please keep it up 🙏
Chris if you do another Q&A vid at somepoint could you let me know how Japan is for people who are really picky eaters? Everything in Japan appeals to me except the food (very unpopular opinion i know)
What rhymes with tatami... Konami tsunami umami katami yo mommy
Oh I'm going to say something about this rap alright. ...I......I.....DAMN IT! It's 'SO MUCH MUSIC' !
16:50 I thought he had a thong on :o
Love the catchy rap song 😁
THE WILHELM SCREAM LMAOOOOOO-
Really good series. You guys are hilarious
I think you did great on the rap song 🎧 i couldn’t have done better !!👍😉😎
Those "igloos" kind of look like adobe houses I've seen in the south west of the US. Like adobe material and hobbit-ish houses.
It will be literally a crime against humanity to ever stop making videos. You have made us go through some really bleak times...
Dont know if you are going to see this. This is a cool channel  been watching for about a year but did not notice  i was not a subscriber!  This vid was good  and im sure the future content will be bigger. Sorry goong in to fan boy mode keep up the good work ( as an english teacher i bet my grammer is gritting your teeth lol) but thanks for showing a culture and country  from a unique  point of view.
Already seeing myself watching this rap hit in 4k on TV
How does Joey have like the best sweaters en T-shirts
You guys had fun and it realy showed in the video! Liked it a lot :)
I love you boys! Thank you so much for making these videos together! Too much volcano is such a banger!!
Whats the first thing that pops into your head when you there there are 3 guys shabbing?
Where can i find the new 2021 hit? I can never have too much of this jam
Awesome explosive RAP boys, well done 👍 challenge excepted and completed 😜
Can see a Psy remix of "Too much volcano" happening soon. Like tomorrow soon...
I live for Natsuky
ART.
Omg that rap song was amazing! I wasn't expecting anything like that! 😂
The truth is that your music video is better than 99% of videos made these days. #toomuchvolcano #grammy #justgivethemtheawardalready
Hey bro, in 2016 you said you gonna lose weight... guess what, you still fat baboooo :D
This is the third time in coming to this video just to listen to the song. Chris cut out song and release a separate video
This was great. You guys make me laugh and forget about the crap in the world.👍
this guy should have his own show just like nanatski
That rap video was better than most I saw. It made my day <3
I only found your videos a few weeks ago and I'm so glad I did I've loved everyone one of them . You've got my sense of humour and I'm always finding your videos funny .please continue making  great content . I really look forward to more👍
A. S. O.  TOO MUCH VOLCANO!!!!
Put the rap on Spotify. Remix with Chris vocals
This is my new favorite anime!
fcking greeeat video (actually the rap song was soooo good! i mean you only had 9 hours xD) Respect my guys i look forward to the next episode! much love from germany
Natsuki closing the curtains though
loved the song! :D
I am so surprised that the rap wasn't worse, so proud of you guys!
Natsuki saying Extra Salami with his legs spread in the onsen put me in my grave.
10 times better than any mumble rap you hear nowadays
Chris got the best buddies in the whole wide world.
The commitment 💪
Get it on Spotify, time to send it to no.1
Rets Go!
Need more of that rap group!
The video is Booming! Great editing!:)
this one is hilarious
Really hope Natsuki is having a good time on his well-deserved holiday.   Also that song is catchy AF.
I enjoyed that song way more than I thought I would.
If Chris had just made that rap video and no other videos I'd be happy.
Natsuki needs to be the tourist ambassador of Aso and "So much volcano" needs to be the province's catchphrase.
Your music video is hilarious 😂 I looooove it XD You guys are amazing ☺️
I love the rap song! 10/10  👏🔥 🎤ASO too much volcano 🎵🎶
When do you release it on spotify?
What's the app you used for the music @abroadinjapan?
The rap song was EPIC 🤣
You guys are downright precious
This is gold
I've gotta admit for the amount of time they had to make a rap song it came out pretty damn good 👌
You can never have too much volcano
That rap song was amazing hahaha damn I expected A LOT less :D
You guys did a really good job with the rap. Well done!
It's Nice.
Those ASO village homes look like the homes from Dragonball.   Wonder which was the inspiration for which.
I can't believe you guys missed the trapdoor in your igloo hotel that would take you to your downstairs games room
"Always fucking place" - Natsuki
EPIC! you guys should make a trial with epic rap battles "JAPAN FIGHT"
that rap song and music video was better than expected and I will now be singing the chorus for the rest of the day
Thanks a lot for your videos. Something about the fantastical Japanese footage  + 80s-esque music + your sarcasm and positivity + your endearing friends are the perfect cure for my lockdown depression. Super calming for the adhd mind. Thanks...i really needed to find more beautiful things in the world to look forward to 💜💜💜
rap : Mount aso, i dont know bout that i just wanna see my girls ass, ooooo       i just saw it    ooooooo i just saw it.   i'll take my grammy and leave.
Hi Chris or community, Could you tell me which ryokan that is where you stayed? I couldn’t find it online and it looked really nice. Thanks in advance😊
男3人旅、楽しそうですね！
Worst rap ever 😂 brilliant!! 10/10 would listen again
I like pizza. Extra salami
gold material put it on Itunes, SoundCloud, Spotify <3
Pleasantly surprised by the rap lol
JAJ Soundtreck: *On* Me : *Grooves like won the lottery*
"Too much volcano" better than I expected. Natsuki and Joey did the good job. Chris would take a part of the rap song.
Waiting for "not enough volcano"
That rap had 0 right to be as good as it was. Nice work
You can bet I am going to blast this on my headphones the next time I'll visit japan
love your videos mate, really entertaining, as always
Best part of the vid.......A.S.O....No volcano.  Well done guys.  Will need to check out that hotel onsen with the Mrs our next trip to Japan.
I def see this one going on the charts!
Awesome series from the start. Production on level! Keep it up, your rap challenge did deliver! Big thumbs up.
Joey should've called rustage for that rap challenge. It didn't say any limit to who can join
Alternative title: BTS for the best music video
High production value videos 😎 such an enjoyment to watch these. Surprisingly APPARENTLY made by  according to a commentator, the biggest hater of Japan 🤷‍♂️
I won't lie that was pretty cool and funny rap song better than most rap songs i hear these days. 10/10 for taking the time to put it together!
EXTRA SALAMI
ASO
It was so wholesome to see Natsuki's reaction to his room, from what we see he works so hard and he deserves it for that, and for being such a cool dude! Enjoy Natsuki!
Song was awful, they should make a whole album
Omg, we need more of music videos from u guys 😍😍😍
Can I somehow nominate the rap song for whatever the Trash Taste award gonna have this year?
ASO TOO MUCH VolcanoOOOO 😂😂🤣
ASO! too much Volcanoes! 🌋 loved the rap video more of those please 😂
I thoroughly enjoyed it all, but my favourite part has to be Natsuki's chorus of the rap.
Joey dances like Pink Guy lol
That songs needs a blueface feature imo
瞬間で70万再生行くこのチャンネルのすごさにびっくりしてる。 編集も企画も、色々大変そうですが、応援してますのでがんばってください
That was actually very good. You Should speak to Tom Smith from JPU records (Japan Underground) ... Future Rap sensations.
When will you be going back to the tomb of Jesus Christ.
Personally, I loved Too Much Volcano because I’ve experienced the feeling before…. 😂
A S O so much volcano too much volcano
That was indeed incredible haha!!
For some reason it sounds really good 🤣🤣
Wait... who’s the other cameraman?
That song was way better than it had any right to be, love how happy you all seemed making it 😂
Your videos just get better and better (not that they were ever bad). Thanks Chris
it shouldn't count as we didn't hear chris in the rap music video lol
Soo errr where can I buy the rap song...
Need the long version featuring doja cat
I...i'm sorry but i really like that song. It's so groovy XD
Too much Volcano 😂 classic. Good job boys.
God, both places at that Onsen look spectacular. I so want to go.
A! S! O! too much volcano~
I whole heartedly enjoyed the video with a cup of tea.
ASO TOO MUCH VOLCANO
I wanna go to a volcano right now xD
A S o so Much volcano !!!!!!
Tune!
Extra thumbs up for the Wilhelm scream. Superb rap song!
waiting for thr single
Hello Chris!   I don't comment often but I thought I should today. I just wanted to say thank you and amazing job! I LOVE the journey across Japan series. I cannot believe it has been that long since you did the first one. I enjoy your videos very much and JAJ has a special place in my heart. I am very excited to see the rest of this journey. I hope you all had fun! Your editing style and videos are always top quality and the effort you put in really shows. I just wanted to add another positive comment to the video to balance out those random grumpy comments about bathtubs and bee larvae. I am sure there are many people like me who feel the same way but forget to comment or are too shy to comment. I am sure I will see you around in Pete's chat but otherwise if you read this, Thank you for your hard work!  Cheyenne - aka BewareTheCheyenne
Omg Joey nailed it, rap was damn good💯👌🏽
“Worst. Rap. Song. Ever” - Comic book guy.
The rap is solid
You can really feel, how much Chris enjoyed filming that rap video. I absolutely love it! It's nice that Chris can live out his passion at occasions like that. Well done!
now we only need the part 3 of dr jelly
that rap music video is so cool! you guys should do it more often :)))
Brilliant :D
for some reason I like the music video...
1000 points for ingenuity... minus 999 points for style. Still that’s not so bad is it.
Man, you've got such an amusing band of lively people! Really envious😫, full bro vibes there! Plus the camera work and the quality of videos are so brilliant! How much are you spending on the production of each video!? We are so lucky to be able to view such quality content for free on YT! Also, the rap video was so good (given you guys had just 7 hours to shoot it!)XD
wtf chris is actually literally spittin bars
I am really enjoying your travels and the rap was pretty good!
That chorus is now stuck in my head…… well done lads!!!! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🇦🇺
A S O too much volcano.  Very catchy... It's stuck in my head.
This rap made me way too happy !!!!
i love katsu and risotto so much, theyre so funny !
It's brilliant !!! I'm a huge huge fan, despite the number of F-words you guys use and the occasional chain-smoking Natsuki. I actually thought the rap showcased Natsuki's MV talents very well!! Respect your work Chris!!! Helping me to relieve my JET days in Japan vicariously...どうもありがとうございました。
awww chris wasn't in the rap vid
243 people clearly dont think its enough volcano!
Great video and honestly both the onsen hotel rooms and especially the volcano desert looked amazing !
👂🏼 🪱
I'm sorry but shabbing is way too close to shagging
Too much volcano was excellent 12/10
This rap song will be stuck in my head all day🤣🤣🤣
Don’t normally comment on your videos but the rap was just too good and bad at the same time to not comment 😂👌🏻 props guys
A S O so mich VOLCANO!!
Waiting for the spotify release
Danger Volcanooo tune ✅✅
Actually enjoyed the song 😂
Joey has flow!
I need to know: what is that looping app called??
I would have said houses from DBZ
I love this so much. ♥️
Awesome video and nice rap video 😊👍🏼
I think only time Chris saw Natsuki workout was in video about bad case of diarrhea
H    A     R     D     C     O     R      E
10:39: Yellow means "Evacuate Immediately"  Chris: Let's go investigate
So is there a Volcano or No? Which is it
This is the best worst rap song in 2021.
That’s next years Eurovision entry sorted 😎
I like how they still sub Natsuki even though he's speaking English XDD
Full on music video. It was good.....Effort 🤣 Nah it was good!
Looks like a fantastic time, and that song was banger ;)
natsuki is such a good guy man ya love to see it
not bad. good challenge.
Chris, what app did u use to make the rap song?
That song... too much amazing. So catchy, I love it!
Someone please remaster this and sell it! ❤️❤️❤️
Bad ass
ngl, the rap was good.
love it, I'm deaf btw
ASO what a good video :)
Best video ive seen in a while. And I think you guys completed the challenge the best any challenge has been completed in all of Journey across Japan. Loved it!
It looks like a village from Dragonball
Wilhelm scream addition to the "rap" song was kind of funny. Looking forward to next episode 😀
"It's not quite tabaco and it's not quite a cottage, but either way Tabacottage is my new favorite word."  I feel like I've heard this somewhere before ...   Jokes aside I love this little reference to the original Journey across Japan!
Fuckin hell the rap blew me away.
not gonna lie it's still better than 90% of the rap songs other youtubers make
The rap song Joey never knew would launch his rap career
The rap song I didn't know I didn't need inside the video I know I needed. It's like finding wasabi, inside a sushi, something you'd taste later when you play bishi bashi. Yet you end up loving it, craving it, wanting it...
the music video was what i would describe as "exceptionally youtube" and i love it.
Looking forward to your collab with Eminem and Lil Wayne
When does it come out on Spotify? I wanna wake up to my new favourite rap<3. I am serious. I love this. It gives me serotonin.
I love your videos; They are such a comfort! Thank you for all your hard work.
I don't know.... the rap kinds slaps. Well done guys. Looks like a great adventure to me.
i thought this was great! absolutely hilarious!
when u put money in the title: STONKS
Scariest Chris Broad face ever !   stop on  29:03
Chris: Making an excuse so that Natsuki can't interrupt his lovey-dovey time with Joey on their 'date.
It sounds like Joey needs more Dr. Jelly in order to write better raps. XD
18:01 "Shabu shabu" should've been the catchphrase of the great Kobe Kobe.
I love you guys! I wish you guys would let us link up in Japan one of these day!
This was absolutely fantastic 😆
Good job guys. Well done.
So much joy in this video. Great stuff
Friggin love Natsuki!
Joey's moves near igloo houses were kitty😂
The rap was the best part
Good god the editing of that rap video was so good.
Epic!
The production value of that rap song is higher than than the actual show.
How did Chris worm out of participating in the Rap after all the hype. Editing?
Too much volcano 💯🙏😏
Nice and very funny .... dop....😎
lol, it's better than I thought. Reminds me of those 90s, cheesy rap videos that tries to teach kids a lesson.
I know you all think the song is shit but honestly I'd say its better than 90% of modern rap :P
Love the series and The Rap was awesome !
Finally a rival to my last bop "Cycle Bycicle"!
Loved it
Perfect mix of lads living it up and interesting content
To think that these videos are as good, if not better than what NatGeo can produce
Is it available in iTunes!? Hahah loved it!!
Loved the video guys.  Great catchy song.   Watching from New Zealand .  Debbie & Patrick
rap earworm ATTACK!
The igloo village looks like an OG Dragon Ball village or a town from the original Phantasm Star games.
Omg this is the best video ever, would like 100x if I could.  Can't get the song out of my head now tho.
I don't know if Too Much Volcano lived up to its predecessor "Cycle Bicycle" but it proved itself well enough. 😂 ~:~
14:43 TAKE IT EASY MAN. *he has PTSD about water assault now* Edit: 22:56 wilhelm scream. Nice.  What an amazing piece of art.
The rap was really entertaining! Good job guys!😎
The rap song is legit better than any of today's  mainstream rap, not even joking. Great job as always!
Those igloos might as well have “Capsule Corp” written on their side.
Mount Aso looks like Death Stranding, if you know you know
21:22 Chris: here's the rap song *AD* *starts* *playing*
Love the rap video, but really want to see bloopers. 😂😂😂
Na-Na-Naaaaaaa- Natsuki
I agree, too much volcano led to all the heat being channelled into that rap song
there faces, lmao  pause within a second of 21:20
I'd sign em'.
But the melody is actually catchy lol 😂 love it dudes 🤘🏼
That was damn funny. Thanks for the schnitzen giggles, guys!
Two days later and I still have "Too much volcano" stuck in my head...
Something nice.
Another really fun video :D
Excellent Video as expected and you guys killed the song ! Definitely Timeless to say the least
ngl i fuck wit the beat of "to much volcano"
Too much volcano Is fuego
I love natsuki’s vibe
Cant wait for the next episode
Chris, Joey, Natsuki, Norm, and everyone else behind the scenes that I’m unsure of I just want to give you a round of applause for this wonderfully shot and edited and creative short film and amazing rap you’ve managed to put together in such short time. I could really see all the fun and enjoyment you had in this. I don’t normally comment but I had to share my joy with everything you brought to this. Seriously great job team. Can’t wait for the following episodes!   -Justin
Hey Chris I'm coming to Japan next year. When would be the best time to visit? I wanted  to come in June (as my 33rd Birthday is in June) but I heard June was a bad time to come. So any thoughts on when would be a good time to come?
This could be a netflix series, but is here for everyone. Thanks Cris
natsumi's last words at the end tho hahaha xD
Damn guys, too much volcano is stuck in my head
I expected the song to be a lot worse and tbh it was not too bad. Good work
"Too much volcano" is erupt song that it blows your mind so much that you became a lava of it.
Your rap was great, it would have been groundbreaking...   ...if it had been released in 1982.  But only because there were no other white rappers around then.
You've got a banger right there, my lads.
name a better trio rn lol
I hate that the song was kinda good
Amazing all I heard was fresh prince of bell aire but better
This rap kinda slap tho🥲
What’s the name of the onsen you stayed with the private baths? It’s hard trying to find it when I know very little kanji 😅
@22:54 Excellent use of the Wilhelm scream in any media I've ever seen. 💯💯
Just caught up with the last two uploads with a some wine and a big stupid smile on my face. One of the best shows on YouTube!
ASO~ Too much volcano ~ pretty catchy haha!
Ahhhhhh this was amazing!!!!!
that hot springs looks amazing! i absolutely want to visit there! also the rap was pretty decent, i dont really like rap but i enjoyed it. was well put together.
That rap song taught me that you can never have too much volcano
Gotta love that Natsuki!
Trying to find the exact ryokan you stayed in.
That rap song was horribly amazing! Great job, bois!
Ok. I loved that rap video. There is indeed too much volcano.
Can I use "Too Much Volcano" in one of my YT videos without getting copyright claimed? :D :D :D
There is only one like button!
Great job, guys!! 😘🤙
Literally singing the chorus at work and realized no one else knows Japan’s #1 hit.
Anyone know the song he uses for the intro?
who is the camera man
You never fail to amaze me with your talent in film (and now Rap??!) making!! Honestly better than anything I see on tv. Thank you so much for making these videos for us 😄
I actually really liked your rap lol
i wanna give you all my money bc i love this shit but im broke
As a Canadian I imagined something different when I read "IGLOO" aha
A-S-O! So much vulcano!
Natsuki should just do music lol that and always be himself more food and joy to your life. To all the A broad group.
i need a shirt that says "too much volcano" on the front and "no volcano" on the back
that rap works
Above all, I just hope Natsuki has a nice holiday far away from work commitments.
Holy guacamole.
The missed opportunity for Natsuki to rap to in japanese, would've been absolute fire
Too Much Volcano is the hit rap of 2021! Another great Journey Across Japan episode!
Good Job Bois! Too Much Volcano for the win! 😂✨👌🏻✨🤌🏻
Upload the original voice & video recording , and I'm sure some professionals can make a masterpiece out of it. The visuals are not bad. But mixing is certainly not your specialty.
Great now I have 'ASO...to much volcano' stuck in my head.
That song and video was amazing... is there a behind the scenes on how you did it? The process behind making it?
Everytime Natsuki said "A S O" I heard it as "hEy Ass Hole" which made it 5000x better.
Good video, but when is the song coming to Spotify?
Amazing vid Chris joey and natsuki the music will go on to be compared prince ,queen,and Beethoven
If you put this on Spotify I will add it to my playlist… I am not ashamed
I’m surrounded by asos
I do like dat rap :D
I liked your guys' rap! Way better than anything i could have come up with in a day. 😄 it was a bop
Very funny rap video - Super well edited.
yo the production quality is insane, I love you guys as a trio the chemistry is perfect
The same guide connoly shrug because lunchroom disappointingly accept an a damaging lamp. selfish, nervous open
Chris: What rhymes with tatami? Me: Oh, Origami! Joey: Salami or Pastrami  Well those work to I think XD
Your videos always make my day better :) not this one tho              Jk jkjkk fantastic video as always love you Chris-chan 🥴 stream Too Much Volcano
Does Chris just have like 20 pairs of the same shirt and pants, or does he just wash the same pair of clothes over and over
I do not wish to offend the LGBTQ community, so I will just say that was entertaining.
Nice Uzumaki shirt Anime Man
Amazing part of Japan. Absolutely stunning.
Too Much Volcano 🌋🌋 absolutely slaps 👏👏✨ but not even joking when I say it's been in my head all damn day 😂
Nice! 😂
Whew, that's a spicy hot rap video  Shabba dabbo doo
Great rap. Hall of fame material. Although I can't help but notice that the video was missing an 85 kg British man. Can't wait for more adventure.
Not bad at all.
21:58 "Too much Volacano" 😅😅
NGL, the rap video has better production value than most others, even with a deficit of bitches and making it rain. Though, I guess you wouldn't expect much rain near an active volcano.
The vibe of Naski is awesome. He make the show
Is it just me or does the title of the music video say "volacano"?
its ight
This looks like it was A TON OF WORK to make, well done!
That was great, now I have the rap stuck in my head.
BLEACH?? Kurokawa town!?!? just me? lol  Love the vids btw Chris,  I hope one day to visit japan and make memories! Cheers!
Something nice
too much volcano needs a spotify release
The way Natsuki puts out his hand and says "no thank you" to a force of nature is the peak of this video, second peak was the rap which I rate 10 shabi shabis over 10 pastrami salamis. thank you @highboi for the rating system.
Okay but it's a vibe with this song 🤣
‘ASO, Too much volcano’ is the catchiest shit I’ve heard for a long time • well done, boys
Waiting for the Spotify drop Chris...We’re all still grooving to A S O....too much volcano! :)
Hilarious!!!
I loved it absolutely loved it.  ASO too much 🤩
At the gym, getting my workout on to “Too Much Volcano” 😎
that was the best rap ever, im gonna use shabbing at hot pots now LMFAOO
It became my favorite song about a vulcano
This song was better than I thought it was gonna be.  I nearly sprayed my drink at the monitor during Natsuki's "extra salami" part. And now I suddenly feel the urge to hang in a hot tub with a couple of brews.
That's the first song I've heard that DOESN'T need more cowbell
Yea it’s good
Taboccotage . . . +1
Well done!
Cinematography was great, the rap was awesome! Feel like I'm on vacation too 😂
Geez Chris, you think this is a rap song?!?!? Well why was I jamming then?
Wow like an 80s rap it’s cute ♥️
Too Much Volcano is the type of song I'd have as a ringtone 10 years back - which I promise is a compliment
damn that too much volcano song was fire!!! joey gots them vocals
Feel Natsuki is losing it
Calli has been real quiet since that dropped.
J̶o̶u̶r̶n̶e̶y̶ ̶A̶c̶r̶o̶s̶s̶ ̶J̶a̶p̶a̶n̶   Natsuki's Holiday
The production quality in that rap video was astonishing
Question- at 5:37 what are you guys drinking? I'm sure it's beer of some kind but what brand? Curious minds need to know for uhh... science reasons. Yeah... Science.
The rap video turned out so good. Wow!! 🤯 I was so tickled!! 😆
That is a catchy number - A-S-O - Too Much Volcano...!!! 🤣 I love it, it's up there with the Dr Jelly advert! Good work 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
What an amazing song lads!
That song was beautiful!!
Make that rap song an ring tone
Best rap song ever 😉
I think there were legit moments in the rap visually, it reminded me of the Fresh Prince OP
Chris, can you please fix the link that shows your indoor lens? Let us know when it's fixed!
Omg I love this series 😂 "Too Much Volcano" instant classic!!
I was expecting a bad rap song, not a masterpiece.
Mars, I mean the volcano, looks like Valle de la Luna (Moon Valley) in Atacama Desert at Northern Chile
Better rap video than any mumble rapper out there
That rap came out so much better than I expected lol actually really loved it
Joey's rapping is actually quite good lol very 90s style of rapping
OMG that rap was actually amazing. Put it on Spotify or youtube music perhaps?
What App did you use to make the beat? Seems like something usefull to have.
I liked it.
nice vid!!
No joke too much volcano is stuck in my head
*T A B A C C O T A G E*
Omg I need the rap as my ring tone now
ASO BEST RAP SONG OF THE DECADE NAY THE CENTURY
What was the app Chris used to make the music
the hottest rapsingle this year, too much volcano!!!
I had so much fun watching this episode 😁 but not sure if the challenge was completed 🤔 I missed Chris in Rap video 😅
3:30 that place looks like Yoda’s house on Dagobah
I loved it   three thumbs 👍
I have so much fun watching and looking forward to a new episode of this series! Thank you! :D
Your rap song and video were awesome! Great job. You guys are so talented!! Chris would you please share the name of that app? I've been looking for something like that myself. ❤️❤️❤️
Too Much Volcano is actually quite a banger, not gonna lie! :D
Me: Igloo       I sense a nice bath
I smell a Grammy/
Okay. This song should be on Spotify
Wilhelm Scream FTW!
Chris, you should print a "too much volcano" hat for your collection
Hello to all from New Brunswick,  Canada. This is another great video. Looks like you are all having alot of fun. Keep up the great work!
The entire video was great and the music video was impressive. The beat was nice, the rap had a nice flow, Natsuki's voice is pretty cool and the editing was well done with attention to detail.
This was SOOOO GOOD!!! I absolutely loved it, it's so much fun watching you all together and the rap song, my god. What an adventure, so cool!! 🤣 thank you for all your work and effort, I hope you enjoyed the time a lot together!!
I need this on my phone.
mt aso boku no tsuki na basho
the way he said salami in the song XD
It's so funny how you can tell Joe's all awkward in the music video, but Natsuki's like... business as usual. Inside his head, it's just a 24 hour rap/dance video.
Just imagine how many people have had sex in the bath cave
Its like Tellytubby land :)
Anything with a Wilhelm Scream is worthwhile.
Pleasantly surprised by the rap song ngl
That was actually an awesome  1980-1990 style of rap 🤌
Pretty good video overall! And the attempt at the rap and dancing was good! I like it.
Instant classic!
21:23  -_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_- Too much volcano -_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-
Thank u so much Chris! I had a lot of fun! Your efforts are moving us so much.
I'll never see a volcano as I have now... TOO MUCH VOLCANO.
omg the rap was amazing, thank you all for making my day!
Seeing your videos reminds me of the fun times I had with my family on vacations.  I really miss the onsens
Premium rap there lol... GJ guys
Too Much Volcano should've won a Grammy. Not WAP :/
Something nice
That's great entertainment and content, Chris! Love the quality of the video and the catchy rap song! Got me brimming with smile on the whole video.  Natsuki's impromptu rap at the beginning is amazing as well!
Mount Aso, like a beautiful picture created by the great Picasso… ;)
"Wrets go",  " Welcome to the roadshow of the Nippon Trio" "Kurokawa black river like these Tatami. I like Pizza. Extra Salami" My Boys = Gem after Gem. You Guys are brilliant and achieved in such a short time , with virtually no Swearing(on Camera). A very visually classy effort. I'll be "SHABBING" all day. Cheers Muffy from Oz .
If Natsuki has never been to Aso, has he ever gone to London with Chris for a while?
I'm confused... it's too much volcano but then it's NO volcano? Or is Natsuki saying "No" **to** the volcano? This song is so deep
ASO... Too much volcano. I freaking loved it!
The rap song video part was great. You definitely won the challange.
Rewatching just for the music video. Been stuck in my head since the other day!
Please put Too Much Volcano on spotify so I can jam to it all summer
keep making videos chris! i love them!! <3
Now Chris has to rap by himself but only terribly
I love everything about this
the extra salami was one point though :D
Best rap song ever made
Whenever Chris apologizes, I know I'm in for a treat.
Daaamn Animeman u got skills 🤣🤣
Why would you need to stir the bath?
Honestly, I would love to stay in one but I don’t like how it’s so close to each other. If it was spaced out I would definitely wanna stay there for awhile.
I'm so happy this exists <3
Good ole Natsuki😏
Let’s go!  A.   S.   O.  Too much volcano! Too much volcano….gah! It’s in my head!!! 👍
Amazing editing
Such a great video! Thanks as always! Where's the sponsor though?? Companies are missing out!!!
Thanks to that song, my life is completed :) thanks.
I stumbled on this channel as I went down the rabbit hole of youtube and I'm hooked!
the WILHELM SCREAM
Joey is contractually obligated to be filmed in a bathtub every time he's on Chris' channel
i enjoyed the rap song at the end actually very good LOL
Chris you didn't sing, so I'm sorry to say that you all failed.
That rap song was epic
Superfun @ Mt ASO
That was a flippin' rad slice of words you boys spat at us. Man throw us more of that good stuff y'all.  thumbs up to Chris, Natsuki and ma boy Joey. Well done guys, and awesome series. Keep 'em coming yo.
Natsuki is a fucking star
Where can i buy this song
i worked on production where we planned things like this for weeks. You edit it and filmed it in 9 hours. - Music companies should hire you all!
That just cracked me up😂👌. Absolute mint!
why do I now crave to be inside the little dome
can i maybe please get the name or the link of the 3 little rgb lights that have been used for the red light
Any chance we can get "Too much Volcano" by itself on a separate video?
The rap reminds me of the Library Card song from Arthur and I don't know why
I need Too Much Volcano in Spotify right now
the rap reminds me of 1980s and Will Smith.
The rap song just took 20 years off my life 💀💀
i cant get rid of ASO TOO MUCH VOLCANO now
To be fair that rap song was better than some "professionals"  😂
These videos are getting progressively more enjoyable recently. Keep up the good content. I would love to revisit japan sometime soon. Beautiful country
Great, but hoped more topless men in water please   ;-)
That’s was a great rap song  🤣🤣🤣
nice rap song guys!
Strong Dragonball vibes
The igloos remind me of the Wigwam Motel in Arizona (and many other similar 1950s/60s motels). Probably similar construction (concrete over foam)  https://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/route66/wigwam_village_hotel6_holbrook.html
A bread in japan
"Too Much Volcano" was so good! Adding to playlist. xD
It's too catchy.. I want a "too much volcano" T-shirt
Can't get this song out of my head.
That rap is actually brilliant. I am shooketh😂
I would love to see Natsuki to speak more in his native tongue so he can be more expressive and not limited by the language barrier. So come on Chris, get on with the subtitles for Natsuki 🤣.
非常にわかりやすい！
I really loved it when you quoted Elon Musk as I feel you could totally cosplay him
I want to move to Japan and be friends with these guys!  :-)
One of your best videos. This is quickly becoming my favorite Japanese culture channel!
I have not watched TV or movies for years, but I am looking forward to these episodes on a daily basis. Many many thanks for all the hard work to bring us this superb quality content. I really genuinely cure my depression with this channel.
NEW VIDEO https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67Y6Gq7Kxg4
something nice
Does anyone know the music at 10:10?
that rap song was LIT!!!!! hahahaha by far the best challenge of the series in my opinion!
Seriously the production quality of your videos is insane! And that rap music video was next level. Can't wait for the next episode where you're riding horses!!!
When you make it big in life you get to live in a fancy foam igloo in the vicinity of a volcano. Very informative, the more you know.
2:58 Flintstones? Smurfs? Those igloos come straight from Dragon Ball! 😁
superb.... just loved it.... is such fun to watch your videos...
How uncomfortable Chris sounds when saying "The rap" hahahaha
Great video once again Jack
Nicely done on the rap fellas! Joey sounds alot like will smith😂😂
I’ve been following you for years but I noticed the quality of your content just keeps get better and better! I swear I thought I was watching a series on Netflix or something! Keep up the great work! And the rap just works 😂😂 love it 🥰
That rap wasn't half bad fellas 👌🏾🤘🏾
that video is FIREEEEEE!!! im streaming right now.
How do you abbreviate "Too much volcano" into ASO?
Liked for Abroad in Japan liked for the rap song.
Absolute banger, lads. Great video too
Upload the song as its own video!!! 😅 like if you agree!!👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿
Reminds me of Prince of Bel-Air. Great video
rap was a banger, good job lol
The Rap Video turned out great!
Who else thought Chris felt really bad and awkward after pushing Natsuki into the waterfall. I felt as if he was making up for it the entire time afterwards lol. Haha
Tbh i saw waaaay worse music videos than this masterpiece! in 9 hourse only... great work guys!
It’s was the perfect amount of volcano.  Well done.👍🏽
I just wanna know where the camera man sleeps when we only ever see 3 beds in every place you stay lol
This is such a fun video! I love how everyone's dedicated to really giving Natsuki an enjoyable holiday AND creating classic content!
The journey across Japan series is one of the things keeping me going as I work 2 jobs
I enjoy your videos, great entertainment. Thank you ❤️
Ahhh fantastic song! Please release this as a separate video so I can play it for my friends when it gets stuck in my head. 'ASO Too much Volcano!'
Lmao it was not until like halfway thru the song that I realised A-S-O spelled aso. Like mount aso XD
quality content as always brahh!
Natsuki is an ancient god thats why normies like chris cant be able to understand him that well
Shabbing sounds to simular to sagging 😂
I found it to be just the right amount of volcano to be fair
The Aso Farm Village reminds me of the Aru Village from one of the Dragon Ball Episodes.
I'm gonna tell my grandson a Japanese man once said, _"too much volcano"_
Terrible and brilliant, so I guess terribly brilliant.
I think a Japanese went to Alberobello in Italy and It tried to copy Trulli, without much luck.
Is there Too Much Volcano or No Volcano?
22:16 A is stand for...     Amogus.
this is really some high quality content 😂
22:55 A clear example of Chris' impeccable sound design and comedic timing.
Those lyrics are shockingly good! Well done that man.
Can you put Too Much Volcano on ITunes? I’d literally buy it and listen to on repeat lol. It’s so good! 👍
Pure gold from beginning to end.
Tbh i really liked it
Omyyyyy so goooooood . So much work 0o0 someone give them an award TT
Yo Chris has lost weight, or he just looks skinnier in black.
natsuki's laugh/chuckle sounds alot like mr beans
The rap is delightfully dumb
That was incredible lol
RAP is not ridiculous.!!! How dare you hate the RAP culture now
02:14 Natsuki Being an Aerosmith Head...!!
Natsuki is an Aerosmith head ....!!
Great video Chris. It was good seeing you, Natsuki and Joey. Norm did awesome camera work, I love Too Much Volcano
Your Journey Across Japan series is probably the most fun I've seen you have, and honestly I cant stand when people call you fat. No, I am fat. Chris may be a little pudgy but its still well within the healthy range as long as hes drinking water and keeping his blood flowing. And you travelling with friends, doing fun challenges, and eating new things is exactly the kind of example that most regular people should do, and if they cant because of work then they should demand better for themselves.
Honestly impressed by the rap song! I'm glad you included the "tatami" "salami" rhyme
Oscar + Grammy
Oh my god. I just realized Mt. Aso is the  Mountain  that Lina inverse blows up in slayers to impress one of her friends--or is based on it. Wow.
When is the song gonna come out on Spotify? TELL ME WHEN!!
ASO TOO MUCH VOLCANO ...🤣😘
The best content on YT, no contest.
Went to mt aso in  2019. Was all fogged in. But your rap is brilliant ! You guys are so talented. Love Natski. So cute.
The song was much better than expected.  For a day challenge that was great.  It may have been too much volcano, but it was just the right amount of Natsuki.  Very much enjoyed.  Thank you for it.
Brilliant
that rap video makes up so much for the failure last week, great job on the lyrics Joey! and well edited in such a short time
Man.. japan really have many incredible places in every part of its country. If chris had to do journey across my country he probably out of content.
Poor natsuki had to sleep by himself lmao
Please please release this on its own
I’m gonna need you to release this song separately, otherwise prepare for too much volcano
The Wilhelm scream during the rap, lmao 😂
This is like a weird parody of PaRappa the Rapper
So amazing, I love these journey across Japan videos
This is amazing. To more adventures to cone. Kanpai!
It's my first time that I see a recent video xD I would like to make a brillant comment, but I feel to have an english that is good like Natsuki's one! Also, I have no idea if I wrote it coreectly... sorry Chris-sensei! A big hug from Italy :D
I tried watching Ryotaro's channel and Sharla's, etc. But they just don't click with me as much as your pug mug does. You're the poor man's champagne replacement.
The rap was actually good , really enjoyed the video.
Please make a video about sumo.
I was totally vibing to that song
wait... weve bene here before.....
*sees horses in the preview for next episode* *starts vibrating with excitement*
6/10 too much volcano
Number 39 on Trending! Was probably even higher earlier.
Joey and Natsuki rapping is the weirdest yet greatest highlight of any video. I hope Chris feels like a Band Producer now!
Too much volcano is actually kinda a bop you know?
Loved this! well done, what a team!
What a song
Loved the video and the music video was amazing!
I just realize that Chris looks so much like Marcus Mumford
We need to make CHRIS have to sing by himself, cause there was a severe lacking of his vocals.
That’s so hilarious. 😂 and that onsen place looks fire!
I want someone to rap this if the trash taste boys do another talent show. This would be gold loll
I enjoyed the rap, but it is a lie... there is not too much volcano in the video. I want to see Chris singing a rap like a pirate.
All 3 of you are adorable and I would love to have friends like you all.  Thanks for sharing!!!
so, did natsuki found his long lost relative?
I actually liked the rap song it was fun good job guys
Can we please get Too much volcano on Spotify?
Great job guys
Im so glad for you!! your trending!!
Is too much volcano on apple music/spotify yet?
最高です! The random holding of the windshield wiper tho...🤣
I love this series. I hope every episode is just Natsuki doing some weird shit, Chris info dumping around it, and Joey being torn between his two road trip dads.
I don't wanna die without experiencing an onsen
I dunno is it just me but the video isn't showing in my feed or on Chris's channel. Had to click on the link in the Rap Video to watch it....🤔
At first I was like what is this song 🤨 but now I need more 😤
Hard bed? Japanese people sleep on the floor, that is hard!
that song was fire. ASO SO MUCH VOLCANO
I wonder is any movies where shot at the igloo village.
Joey can sing? Color me surprised.
joey casualy writing a banger SONG while Natsuki brings the Energy and Chris with the editing skillz wtf actual BANGER :D :D :D  ASO
This is my new favorite Japan video!
I love the Too much volcano song .  Great job guys!
This rap almost reached the level of *deer bear boar*
Petition to add "Too much Volcano" into Spotify
so uh, when is Too Much Volcano gonna drop on spotifiy?
Does anyone know the app that Chris used to make the beat?
haha that rap song was brilliant ! 😆 overall the series has been really great, huge respect 👍
What time of the year was this filmed in? 12:46 looks like it might be coming into Autumn, the trees look so nice with the touch of orange
It's not about your language quality when you speak it.  It's about the confidence you have
So when Joey said he can rap, is this from the Collab they had at Trash Taste with Mori one?
Grammy award winning material right there.
I actually like the song
this show is so gay
Great episode! Thoroughly enjoyed it.
Great rap lads! Beat box more pls
Natsuki disgusted by the volcano smoke, proceed to smoke 7 cigarettes after
Climbing Volcano Aso, got my lasso around the peak. High and in the sky, im sippin on clouds to wet my beak. Yeah we hot mother-f@%#er  Got liquid magma beneath me feet Im blowin' out, cant stop me now Im spittin fire upon this beat.
ASO, my new ringtone <3
40 on trending btw
This is gonna be in my head for far too long😂
Something Nice.
The video was of exceptional quality. Thanks for the video.
How dare you do a good rap video! It wasn't half bad.
this was great those hot spar rooms wow loved to get pissed there lol
Imagine what you guys could have done with more time! 25 minutes of great fun. Thanks.
Gonna need a CD with this on it now.
Please please tell me which inn you stayed at in Kurokawa Onsen?
The rap video was PERFECT.
And the award goes to...Chris' seat belt. As always good work.
Best entertainment EVER, I love Journey Across Japan
Aso means smoke where I come from. The rap made so much sense to me haha!
Liked the rap video!!
This type of videos make me really appreciate youtube and some of the channels and people that exist on it.  I really respect and admire your work Chris. You allow someone like me to see special beautiful places than I can never see or visit in my life time. Thank you.
As someone who's last name is tobacco, I will definitely name my house the tobaccotage.
This songs been stuck in my head all day
THE NEXT DAY: Aso scraps their green to red eruption alert system and replaces it with the more direct " No Volcano/Too Much Volcano" system.
That rap is a banger!
Honestly, this rap is really good, for the amount of time you had. It doesn't hurt my ears, so that's already a good job!
To be fair, I think the rap was quite good. I'm sold. Regan
that was epic! good job on lyrics, cinematography, and music.
The rap was unironically great actually lol
Chris, when are you gonna get a Japanese GF and introduce her to us? 😏
It was a great rap video! Well done guys hahaha
Damn, 25mins of good stuff, great video and awesome rap, loving it
Why be a rap King when you can be a Rap God like the trio!
That rap is actually something nice
What is the name of the song was playing in the background when you were visiting the volcano? By the way I really think you should add your song choices to the description because this is the third time I’ve tried to look up a song that you’ve used
Where does the cameraman stay?
I was like omg this is gonna be a mess but it was fucking good waw. is ASO SOS
That is going to be my new ring tone lol😎
Catchy af! Great work Nippon trio!
So... when will this rap song be on spotify? :v
Such a great episode!
I love it! Too much vulcano is now my new summer track. Well done.🌋
I'm gonna need some "Too much volcano" merch!
Hi Chris, great to see this part of the world again, along with your exceptional film making.  what is the name of the ryokan you stayed at in Kurokawa?  i'm planning a potential trip for next year and it looks superb. Thanks Jack
Amazing haha ASO TO MUCH VOLCANO
A S O... No volcano
Nice rap :)
Great episode! LOVE THE RAP VIDEO. You have THE Best content on YouTube. The three of you combo is magical. Thanks 😊
This is genius! You really went wild with the rap and video. Commitment and focus! A S O too much volcano
10:41 second worst situation at the volcano -> Evacuate immediately. Joe a few minutes later is this safe? No... No its not
brilliant rap
That song is fire!
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 no words... Literally crying with laughter. A. S. O. Too much bloody volcano 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
LOL please put the Volcano song on spotify or itunes
woahhh I went there before. the igloo hotels
Too much volcano is a master piece. Chris Broad (or whatever his name is) is a coward and a thief for not singing and appearing in the clip.
Wow you three are hilarious what an incredible time, can't believe I just found this channel after watching your Hyde video!
What app did you use for the beat?  This is amazing. I love natsuki and joey so much, they're so so awesome but I love you the most, Chris.  You're the best lol and I look forward to the new episode haha.
Great sound track. What’s the name of that app?
“It’s not Luis Vuitton it’s just a massage chair” biggest flex 2021
Please tell me there will be video themed merch
Joey actually managed to use "shabbing" in the lyrics, such a mad lad. XD Loved this.
That song is forever etched in my brain... Good work guys!!!
I really like japan.. i hope i can living in japan.. work. N enjoy living live
Black tatami like a ninja army. On the floor, by the door you never know who they are coming for. Mount Aso, like the Sea of Sargasso, deep, dark and no walk in the park. Thank you all, I'm here all night.
"Is this safe?" - No not particularly. Lots of people have bought it up there.
Natsu created a verb before bedtime.
When that rap video is low-key better than any mv gabbie Hannah has ever put out
ASO   Too much Volcano. It's stuck in my head now ^-^
Joey should rap battle Eminem
I'm a climber too  I climb stairs 😂
5:40 you two are drinking Horoyoi. I didn't realize you were 16 year old girls. Did every conbini in the area run out of strong, along with any other drink imaginable, after natsuki bought his beer?
That rap music video made me laugh so much!
Amazing.
What's the name of the Inn with the private onsen? Thank You!
Shabbing with my boys  I died
When natsuki said nowhere nowhere,I wish he said only here after it
loved the rap, it was a great challenge.
The theme tune of this series is still awesome, and the graphics still look exactly like prawnhub.
And the best music video of 2021 goes to......... Abroad in Japan!!!!
The song's actually pretty good lmao
Just come here for the Rap.. and I say is 100/10 👍
why didn't you rap bro?
Why isn't this award winning hit not on Spotify?
The rap video was simply ... outstanding!
You guys should do an update extended version, just the rap music video!
rap game been kinda silent after this one dropped.
"Too much vulcano" - my 2021 holiday hit 👍
Man nastski is so enthusiastic lol what a great guy  Edit: that tune is hot my dudes 🔥
It's past 3:30am and and I can't stop laughing at the rap and now it's stuck in my head. Someone overhead it and asked if Joey was Will Smith 😂 I can't unhear that now.   Chris, this is some damn good quality content you make. I live your more serious documentary style videos too.
Coming to Spotify and other music streaming apps, "Too Much Volcano", by Dr. Jelly, featuring Justice Delicious.
Lol ! great rap video  that's a lot of effort!!
Didn't expect the song would be this good.
MY STOMACH HURTS , I ALMOST DIED , TOO MUCH VOLCANO!!!
your song is stuck in my head
this rap song really hit home for me! :D  ASO.  So much volcano!  and the scenery is just beyond gorgeous. would I risk TB to see a volcano this close? not sure xD fantastic video as always! ;)
Can we have “Too Much Volcano” on Spotify??
One day i will have ASO stuck in my head and will be unable to remember what song it is...
8:53 Thats some rly red dirt. D:
Best episode ever in history of abroad in japan  Love from india 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳 Keep it up guys.....  Waiting for more videos.
the grammy awards are asking for your number i am not a rap fan, infact i might be the only 22 y/o who hates rap, but this is some nice rhymes
the rap gives me LIFE
Holy crap that rap was so good!
Did you all share a pod? Where did the camara man sleep 💤
Will this song be available on spotify
What's the name of then app?
Really fun episode!! You guys deliver so much joy! And the rap song  can you download it somewhere??
I’ve heard many blasphemous things in my life.... but aso rhyme with asshole? For fuck sake 😂
Chris Broad's content so good, he's basically auditioning for bigger money.
this series is like anime, you really need to wait a week and it feels like forever
Loved it xD Awsome guys.
Love the cave onsen.
A S O WE NEED MORE VOLCANO!
Song rocked!
I quite like that rap. I also love the theme to Journey in Japan. Was it created for that, or is it from a song?
1:00 The moment when you finally realise, that Natsuki does not have a youtube channel but is on Instagram instead. Double Facepalm doesn't seem enough...
No volcano is too much volcano
Love it! ASO too much volcano 🌋 no volcano 🌋 so catchy😂
Japan really is a mystical place!, I wish to travel there someday.
I am trying to do my job and I just keep singing that song hahaha I love it
🎶ASO too much volcano🎶 .. anyone else got this stuck in their heads now? No? Just me?   Fantastic video quality Chris! The production level on this is insane! I'm looking forward to the next part of the series ❤
Something nice 😁
That's song will be in my head this entire day...😆
why does the song slap so hard though?
Sitting in the inn with black tatami Shabbing with the bois, what oishi umami!
DANGER VOLCANO!
I usually never comment or like on videos but this effort and quality is really tangible. Great job, brilliant work, fantastic doing. The rap song looked really authentic, exactly what you could expect to come from an artist.
A S O
"A.S.O....so much volcano" 👌🙌
It's actually quite nice!
The Igloo town is like Hobbiton/The Shire without being built into the hills. It would be cool if it wasn't so expensive.
That village is straight out of dragom ball
What a song! It was so good!
Nailed the rap... Great work guys
God I love this series!!! I wish they were longer 😭. Amazing rap song as well I really loved it!!
Yes.
While in Japan on my university exchange, I mistakenly asked the cafeteria lady for shabu (drugs/speed?) rather than shabu shabu (very tasty!) and got laughed at hysterically by her and my girlfriend >.>
Do Japanese people call it 'land of the rising sun' or is that an English thing?
Who else just skipped to the rap song😂
Natsuki genuinely has me laughing out loud. He’s brilliant
rap song was so well done love it
A S O so much volcano  no volcano no volcano the lyrics hits too hard
The quality on those two first episodes is amazing. A real pleasure to watch. Great job!!!
no more volcano!
i have seen mutch worse rap vidoes, this one rules, good production, sensible lyrics(kinda:D), catchy music, good job guys!
Don’t mind me making A S O Too Much Volcano my new alarm sound
Hahahahahahahahahahahahhahaah
That rap was so catchy.
You are my favorite YouTube channel, you make it seem like it's actually possible to go to these places
I will now use the phrase "too much volcano" when the shabu gets to hot, when I go shabbing
Chris Broad beatboxes what
background song at the volcano part anyone?
Jesus saves and Jesus loves you too!
Too much volcano
Ok that was fun great job.
15:44 So happy to see Natsuki so happy
*TOO MUCH VOLCANO*
They should advertise it as Dragon Ball Z village.
-Asoka- a~ so ka?  Natsuki Aso.  Taro Aso.
Does anyone know the app he used to created the music for the song? Been trying to look for it,,
“Jorney across Japan: -Natsuki’s Holiday- The Lost Islands”  _J U S T_  *_N A T S U K I_*
ASO is a thing now I guess
The production quality, humor, and creativity thats gone into this channel makes it by far my favorite on youtube.  I wish I had a 4k monitor to fully enjoy the scenery, but I come back time and time again to laugh and learn with you guys.  THANK YOU for bringing such awesome original content to the table and I hope it never ends!!
Best bois
20:57   Nothing to see here, natsuki just performing echo location..
"Too Much Volcano" is brilliant; you could crash iTunes with that song.  Also, Americans will recognize 3:08 shows the village from Rollie Poly Olie :)
So yeah, the song is terrible. But the Video is damn good, sheesh! I really like the drone shots and the lighting effects. You can tell Chris has gained a lot of experience over the years.
YouTuber of the year
Loving the series so far. Natsuki is now a rock star and a rap god.
Top notch content as always. Production quality through the roof.
Omg  that rap song is a gold nugget!!! 😅😅😅
Why does Joey's hair look like an ill-fitting wig?
i feel like this natsuki guy doesn't even know where he is, let alone what's going on lol
Good job with your challenge. Its more about the fun than how good the song is. =3 Just nice to see you guys having a good time~
Not a huge fan of rap but that was better than most of the crap that kids listen to now-a-days!
3% alcohol? Okay.
Chris your hair is thinning. You're getting old, Man.
Holy fuck shit you did an amazing job with the rap song 😁
Love every single video you make Chris. Wanted to visit this country for 14 years and ever since finding your channel during lockdown it's made me just want to board a plane and never come home ✈️
How about a documentary on Soapla…. okok… I give up: a maid coffee will do.
TABACCOTAGE
Second time you've come to mushrom village but you look like 10 years have passed.. :P jk jk love your channel ! <3
Another quality film Chris! That rap is now stuck in my head. Too much Volcano!
This broad in Japan be trending. Hope the views rake up
🌋 ASO 🌋 "So much Volcano"  put that on a T-shirt.
that song is fire tho😂
Nice. The song was great well done.
leaving the flintstones behind...
A day of peak rediculousness. Rapping Abroad and Tim and Finn doing Eurovision. Loved it.
Chris you are doing amazing job as always also the rap song was dope 👌
I'm enjoying your trip across JAPAN, while we have another month of Lock down...  The Dome Village to the volcano was like going from Hobbiton to Mount Doom.  "ASO too much Volcano"...
Yall think this rap, yet the fact you tried and turned in something fun gives you a 💯
So cool guys, loved it!
'SO MUCH VOLCANO'   I felt that😔
I never thought I would say this, but that's a really good rap video.
I really hope that too much volcano wins some sort of online music video award
The editing is absolutely amazing, I can’t believe this is free.
That is ASO48
Joey has got skills. Respect!!
That rap is legendary
The rap turned out great guys! Wish Chris was in the video but I know he edited and made it look and sound great. Glad I can afford youtube premium so I can feel like I paid for this kind of content.
Very cool
I came here, 12 hours later to listen the rap all over again 😆 Love this channel 💕
what can I say but that's one hell of a music video  will it come out as a single or with the album
you all are the best trio on the whole internet
Something Nice
Every episode needs a rap song like that!!
Why was that rap like, actually half decent
Something nice.
Is it Chris Broad or Chris Abroad at this point.
I'm surprised at how good the rap turned out😂
Great song. Amazing hahahaha.
Not the best thing to have “A S O, TOO MUCH VOLCANO” stuck in your head just before you want to go to bed.😅
Very successful challenge. Very creative and a fine job for 9 hours. Up there with the Dr Jelly commercial.
ASO no more volcano. Classic!
Another great video, Chris. Really enjoyed everything and everywhere that you guys went. Can't wait for the next video.
So that was the best rap song music video ever 😂😂
Awesome rap music video! Love it!
holy shit! the rap was lit
When you guys starting your Spotify?
So I woke up today to the rap song and...maybe it was because I was still asleep but that kinda banged HAHAHA
Those rhymes followed like lava. Super hot
The QUALITY! ✨🥂💯
Came in for the scenery stayed for the lit rap song.
"Too Much Volcano" slapped guys. I enjoyed it throughout. It would have been REALLY good had Joey rapped in Japanese tho.
WOAHHHH CHRIS BROAD THE BEATBOXER
Honestly, absolute astonishing and incredible video with high quality
"this getting us out da hood fr I promise you bruh"
Man I appreciate the production quality you put into these videos. Love this series already
Natsuki: "hmm yes the wall is made of wall"
The rap blew my expectations out of the volcano
Damn that ryokan is gorgeous. Wanna stay some place like that someday
I have no idea how they looked at those houses and thought of flintstones instead of dragon ball.
Natsuki is so funny. Too much volcano lol
Was very funny loved it!
Chris can beatbox?
Y'know, for what it was given the time constraints, too much volcano kinda slaps. Great job guys, can't wait 'til next week!
8 years strong 💪
That video NEEDS to be put in a time capsule!
Banger song put it on Spotify
Great cinematography dude, great improvement... you're growing so much in your skill.
The rap is AWESOME! :P
Too much volcano needs to hit spotify QUICK!! its off the charts well done guys amazing work as always!!
No sex No drugs No flexing Pure musical talent
now i'm going to have "too much volcano" stuck in my head forever. thanks guys..lmao
Lol that song goes hard
I got that song stuck in my head  now!
It killed me when he'd say too much volcano then right after say no volcano😂😂😂
For being something done on the spot, that rap was really good.
What’s this onsen called?
I have heard worse raps.
Frankly, your channel deserves a TV series (seasons) in BBC or some major global channel! Great Content!
What the heck lmao. This is good!
When I saw the inside onsent I thought, Chris and Joy will surely go in together <3
Not a bad rap for a joke. Great production values.
Natski made the song THAT MUCH BETTER. BIG PROPS TO CHRIS AND NATSKI
Danger volcano.
49
10/10 rap song
Too much volcano is my new ringtone
Those look like Capsule Corp house!! 👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽
Dont give up the bike shop Orville..
After the 2006 earthquake in Jogja, Indonesia, there's a whole village rebuild with a dome/igloo house like this one. It quickly becomes famous and attracts local tourists. At first, the villagers always complain about the visitor, but now they embrace it. Now they brand the village as "Teletubbies's village", they paint the house in a colorful manner, they take admission fee, etc, and now they got a higher average income compared to the surrounding area.
Honestly wouldn't mind a separate video for th3 song as the song itself is quite catchy and the visuals go well with it
That was quite a good song, at least for 1-day production time :D
Awesome 👏🤙🇯🇵
The rap song is quite lit🔥🔥
please make a stand alone video for the rap video
I actually love "Too Much Volcano" lol
That song low key slapped
Now Urban Dictionary has a new vocab: Shabbing
such high quality content, keep it up
Awaiting the Too Much Volcano full album.
Pls upload the music video as a separate video
Rap song is reminiscent of the Sugar Hill Gang or Slick Rick, pretty dope lol
Fantastic video. Very fun, funny and charming
Swahili speakers, this is THAT Kumamoto comment you have been looking for.
I wish Chris would come in with a beat box solo during the song. But maybe not seeing Chris at all was a blessing in disguise
Freakin love the rap! HAhahaha I did not expect that! thanks guys! made my day!
That song was amazing, you have to post it as a separate music video!
nowhere nowhere oh my god
10:59 me when
A S O - TOO MUCH VOLCANO,  NO VOLCANO,  NO VOLCANO
Gotta say that song is catchy as hell haha glad you guys are having fun out there!
i feel like this is where NF shooted his MV
feel like I haven't enjoyed a YouTube video this much in a long time. It's so well-packed, directed, shot, wow, just wow. oh and lose some weight chris :p
Lol, put that rap on iTunes
I've heard worse raps.  With that said, keep your day jobs, fellas. 😉❤
#releasethevolcanocut
Chris I have to commend you on the level of quality in these videos . Your passion for filmmaking and direction is apparent and the level of production is crazy as every episode seems at least at  tv level. It’s insane that this  type of content can be found for free on YouTube. Keep up the good work! Btw To much Volcano is surprisingly a banger and kinda catchy good job to y’all 3 on that too.
Joy's haircut makes him look like an Australian 'Karen' who wants to talk to the manager. 😆❤
Natsuki should just start playing this song on constant loop in his shop
Too Much Volcano would totally fit into an 80’s Eddie Murphy movie.
Wow
Anime man just nailed it👍😂
🤣🤣🤣
the song bangs
That rap is actually good and catchy. And the music video is really good too! that volcano field is really interesting, looks like a place not on this earth
These look like the capsule corporation houses from dragon ball Z
I don't know if I have the strength to keep myself from singing too much volcano randomly throughout the day
DOCTOR JELLY, NATSUKI, CHRIS = Uniquely AWESOME rap vid.
Too much volcano..
Awesome video as always Chris. That rap song is way higher quality than I had imagined it to be. Almost seriously passable as a real rap song, if you ask me. P.S: Don't ask me, I don't listen to rap! 😂
Why am I singing this now.  Lol
I honestly wouldn't mind living in the Igloo shaped hotel by myself. But with two roommates cramped inside of there I would go crazy
that’s some KINO shit right there.
Chris always looks cold.
A S O ... too much volcano is going to be stuck in my head for so long now (oh my goddd 🎤)
Aso Farm Village is immaculately maintained yet there is never anyone there.  It's bizarre.
I like the song....need some producer to send it to the airwaves.  The beginning had potential. it's very catchy.  I'm gonna be singing it in my sleep too much volcano!!! Good stuff keep it up guys. So jealous I wish I was back in Japan
I dare say it wasn’t terrible. 😂
That rap was surprisingly good. Awesome job, guys!   (Joey, I’d love to know Calli’s opinion of this if she ever gets to hear it!)
Marvelous
the rap was absolutely trash. the cinematics tho, 10/10 XD
Chris, you never failed to deliver. I know of Joey being a musician, but I think he did an awesome job with this rap!!! You two made a great team!
👍🏿
What a Justice Delicious rap song
I’ve had an absolutely shit day, but that rap video made me laugh and maybe do a little dance.
That music video shouldn't have been that good
Awesome video and such a beautiful place!  Thank you for putting these together!  Loved Too Much Volcano also!  We need more music videos!
The song came out so much better than I expected. Good job guys 👍
Well, that rap is stuck in my head now.
desperately searching this track on spotify....
Joey sees a bathtub. Immediately climbs in. Every. Time. 😆
Why isn’t the rap a stand alone video?!
The music video was actually good. It's really catchy  Bravo !!!
Epic! Saw you on Netflix!
Brilliant works guys!! Too much volcano is a hit.lol😉
Sick beats!
That was E.P.I.C., so much volcano, just you wait for fan made remixes. Just awesome.
On trending! Sweet keep it going!
I have a good feeling about the Nippon Trio.   Their first album was better than their first album.    Their next big release is sure to go double platinum.
That's one of the worst rap songs I've ever loved listening to. 10/10
PLEASE put Too Much Volcano on Spotify!!
Japan tourism by Rap. I think this is now your default. bar set high.
too much volcano needs to be on spotify
Ngl... the rap song was pretty lit tho
*sexual voice* EXTRA SALAMII...
Guys I loved the song💕 I enjoy all your videos and I have only possitive comments about your work. Greeting from Chile!
The igloos are where all youtubers actually reside
That rap song is surprising a lot better than anyone expected , good job!
I honestly thought the rap video was going to be corny (nice editing ;) but that was dope haha great work Chris, Joey, Natsuki! Loving the quality, creativity and the attitude!
And the much music award goes to.....
Joey, Garnt and Connor should take Chris on a trip next time
Not the song we wanted....but the one that we needed! Too much volcano!
12:14 it's not a dinosaur, it's a shy Geodude.
The Ashlands of Morrowind.
the best rap song I have ever heard😂😂😂
Looking forward to the eventual 8 Mile Rap Battle between Natsuki & Ryotaro!! 😮
I believe I've watched this an unhealthy amount of times! But I can't help it, it's so catchy. Nice job guys definitely Grammy worthy!
I kept rewatching this because of the song you guys made. 🤣
Each video better than the last. Bravo!!
Is it me or the igloos look like Dragon Ball houses? Coincidence? i don't think so
the rap was pretty cool!
Amazing rap video lmao. I hope you can get it on spotify or something so i can learn the lyrics! Great video as always.
I'd totally buy the song on itunes!
MORE adventures please woOo this was fuuun! \(^u^)/
tomorrow in the shower A-S-O too much volcano♪♫♪♫  granted, it'll be a bit awkward thinking about a japanese middle aged man while in the shower
Lol, love the rap.. I'd love to stop someday at that ryokan, it seem ao relaxing
I was very entertained.
Sulphur dioxide is very poisonous. Your nose gets used to the smell very fast as well, which can be dangerous
Totally loving this series, just two episodes in.  The production quality is top-notch and  I am definitely hooked.  The rap song video is equal to, and in many cases, superior to many professional rap videos.  Chris, you have a great talent and I look forward to watching all your future endeavours, wherever they may take you.  I can hardly wait for the rest of the videos in this series.  Cheers!!
Legendary episode, that song was frickin' fun as hell to listen to also. Good job on this one!
Shabbing around indeed…that was great
This song was 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥! Great job Guys!
COMIN' ATCHA WITH THAT NATSUKI SON, CLUE CLUE CLUE CLUE!!!!!!!!! TOO MUCH VOLCANO!!! NAW MEAN!?!?!?!?
something nice
So where did the film crew stay?
Great episode, though Chris.... maybe switch to light beer
As someone whose exposure to rap pretty much began and ended with Will Smith, I think that was a fun song with many fine qualities!
Make the beats be trippin!🤟
Well, I have "A.S.O. Too much volcano" stuck in my head now. Good job, guys.
23:15 Joey dying inside busting those moves
I expected bad.  The rap didn’t live down to my expectations.
☄️☄️🔥🔥🔥
Pretty good - but Chris you should have sang something!!!
Actually that was pretty good
I will be teaching my students here in Japan today your song.
No volcano!
I don't usually comment but damn! Joey really did a good job on the rap and you did a good job with filming it Chris! Good job all around 🍾
Finally, some good rap music!
The music video was cool
Joey and Natsuki dropping some old school flow like Sugarhill Gang or something
Why are all your videos so fucking fire. I got ASO in my head for ever now.  Bitch

That was awesome. Good job lads!
The A S O too much volcano is actually stuck in my head please help-

ngl the Igloo village reminds me of Koopa Village in Paper Mario 64, especially Kolorado's house
holy shit that rap was AMAZING
Yowwwww this music vid is so dope chris
Too much volcano.
The rap gives me mad old school Will Smith rap vibes.
I have a feeling that song is going to be stuck in my head like Pen Apple Pineapple Pen...fuck...

I thought the song was awesome! Nice job guys!!!
Too Much Volcano is never too much volcano!
Where can I get the single?

Yes! Was really looking forward to this and you did not dissapoint, tbh I think you should make more songs and realease them on spotify, was great fun and wow this whole vid was such high production value and delightful!!
That's just fun 😜
Better set and camera work than most rap videos. Can't wait to see what you have in store for us next!   P.S. Damn, Dr. Jelly can rap.
Music video is 🔥🔥🔥
"something nice"
Surprisingly good
I really enjoyed that rap song and its video, you guys are so much fun! Thank you for all the efforts in making quality enjoyable content.

I never knew I needed to see Chris beatboxing until today. Thank you for that. 🤣
Mah boi made it to trending in the front page of YOUTUBE 😃
Love as always.  Shout out to you guys!  Have fun! 🇨🇦
HAHA this is amazing.
So much volcano. So much good.
Probably the funniest and most well produced series so far, great work
We need Merch saying “ Journey across Japan always f**king place”.
Awesome!
23:15 When you nail those rap lyrics in just 9 hours  Good job joey that was hilarious
Hey brothers and sisters, I love y'all and it's just been in my heart today to share that Jesus love y'all so much and unconditionally. I don't know how much time we left on this earth before Jesus comes, but I want all of us to be ready when He does. Let's leave these things of this world behind for in scripture it says in Matthew 24:35 that heaven and earth will disappear, but my words will never disappear. " Also in 2 corinthians 4:18" So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen, since what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal." Time is so short. And I always say this" I want all of us to be saved. " Jesus is coming back soon." with tears in my eyes I love you guys. Let's take Jesus and His words seriously in these time were in. I know the road isn't easy because there are so much distractions and temptations in this life. But through prayer and fasting we can overcome them. I'm not forcing anything on anybody or even forcing to do something they don't. But if you were to see your mother about to get hit by a big truck, you would do everything to try and save her and if you didn't, it show that you don't love her. So I do the same thing for us about the wrath of God that is to come. I don't want anyone I love, know/don't know or even those who hate or dislike me to face such things. Because I know every soul is precious to God and are valuable to Him. Because before we were born He knew us, He knitted us in our mother's womb, He called us to be His children . His love for us is so great and so strong, it's beyond human comprehension, that even the angels in heaven don't understand it. So I want to tell you it's time to get ready, time to prepare ourselves for the Second Coming of Christ, for the trails and tribulations and for the rapture. As you can see, so many people have turned away from God. The world has become so immoral, wicked, disgusting and violent. Killing people without any care or heart. And that shows that the love of God is growing cold in the hearts of people. Please be ready friends, for when the Son of Man comes. Time is running out. Let's not leave this world with regrets. Because I tell you this, my biggest regret is not knowing Jesus Christ earlier. I love you Guys and Jesus loves you too, that's why He didn't think twice about dying on the Cross for us, knowing that we may not even love Him back. Please take what was said today in consideration because ready or not Jesus Christ is coming back believe it or not Jesus is coming back.   How to be saved? To be saved, a man must confess that Jesus is Lord while acknowledging in his heart that Christ must have full rule over his life and that he died on the cross for our sins and was resurrected on the third day🙏🏾. Also one must repent and turn away from thier sin. NOW, is the time to turn to JESUS, do it before its too LATE and the DOOR of Grace is Shut.  Prayer of Salvation in Jesus Christ🙏  Dear Lord Jesus, I know that I am a sinner, and I ask for Your forgiveness. I believe You died for my sins and rose from the dead. I turn from my sins and invite You to come into my heart and life. I want to trust and follow You as my Lord and Savior. Amen  Spreading the Gospel on every content on YouTube 🙏❤️.
They look like the houses from Dragonball
Wow I never knew volcanoes existed! What a find. Thank you so much. Hot hot springs so hot yeah! 🌋🗻🌋
What's the name of the app 18:50?
"something nice"
The most impressive part about the rap is that they kept the pizza line! There should be more rap songs that involve pizza
Hahahaha Why do I actually like the song, wth why is it good?  This was a super fun video, I've been looking forward to this series for a while!
Journey Across Japan... Always FUCKING place!
When the song was supposed to start, I got an ad about beer. Fun
Where's the Spotify for too much volcano?
It’s not a journey across Japan without beer
I need this rap song on Spotify please😩
Natsuki's hoodie is very Covid chic
Spoiler 🚨 If you just arrived, please wait until the 🔚 for the hit "Too much volcano"
yall gave the sugarhill gang a run for their money
A S O TOO MUCH VOLCANOOOO ahhaahha I couldn't stop smiling and laughing at the rap video, so good!
in my city aso means dog
I appreciate how hard you guys went on the song, oh my goodness
What is the (for back of a better term) the stir stick for? Mix up the minerals? Warm it up or cool it down?
love the jazzy rap<3
all of joeys shirts have been fuckin cool so far
Loved loved loved this video.  Great job!
Better than what's on the radio
Travis Scott who? 🤣
FAT MAN LOVE CHICKEN BUT NOT FANS, PROMISE NEW VIDEO EVERY SATURDAY, BUT RELEASE ON MONDAY. :d
Chilling with the boys in an onsen drinking beer, i want this. A(l)so, too much volcano
Rap song is actually great.
I have never cringed so hard in my life lmao :DDD. Content of pure gold
so when dose the rap get releesed on spotify?
So is there too much volcano, or not much volcano? Or is not much volcano too much volcano? Or is too much volcano not much volcano? I'm confused in a very strange way lol.
A..S..O.. So much Volcano No Volcano Too much Volcano!
After this I’m sure I’ll never have too much “too much volcano”🔥🔥
I'm quite disappointed that Natsuki didn't sing 'fucking volcano'...
Natsuki's engrish makes me smile!
Loved the screaming sound effect after Danger Volcano. Laughed out loud at that, was a great touch. Good work guys, fun to watch.
Nice single, Where's the album?
great stuff guys
Kurokawa onsen is gorgeous! The song was approved by my 4 year old but she does not speak English 😬
i like the scream at Danger Volcano.
I fucking love this channel ❤️
Don't want it to end..
That rap song reminded me of the Lonely Island🔥
Music video was straight fire 🔥🔥🔥
I'm not gonna lie, that song is better than 90% of what's on the radio these days.
im 25 seconds into the video and I've already liked it because its so different from other peoples shit XD
So nice to see a YouTube video showing this. Been there myself in the past.  If I could... I think I  would have at one time seriously considered living there.  But right now living and working in rural Central Texas with my wife currently.  Texas is a really nice place to live too IMO..... but also love Japan a high % of the time.   🤷‍♂️There are "those day's" of 🤯 everywhere.   But really enjoy spending time with Japanese folks more than average.   Even if it involves "camping" which is another native English speaking expression for the nuances of the expression *"sleeping rough"*  In Australian's version of native English.  They refer to transients living with only a backpack often as "Waltzing Matilda".  I've done a *little bit* of that and checked often into the "Starlight Hotel" more often than not. 🍻 "Cheers!! Everbody!!"
Top tier quality content
I love Natsuki 😹 you guys all crack me up thanks for the laughs. Glad you had fun lmao
I cant wait for Too Much Volcano Two: Much More Volcano
The rap video has no business being this good for only one day Actually unreal!
Man I love the content on this channel , been watching for over a year now and have been eagerly waiting for new videos ever since. I don’t comment much on YouTube videos but you guys deserve to know how much of a good job your doing . Keep up the good work 👍  “ASO, Too much volcano “!
That rap video is a perfect example of why editors are so important :P
That damn song is gonna be stuck in my head all day
OMG for 9hrs this is absolutely amazing. It was not bad at all!!!! Can't wait till the next video.
A.S.O. TOO MUCH VOLCANO! 🎶😎
Ok time to put the song on Spotify for us all too enjoy when we want to :D
10/10, Loving the series!
Great job! Awesome video and rap! Can’t wait for the next video!
I can't watch this videos without a stupid smile in my face!!!
i love this :D
hello friends
i appreciated the Wilhelm Scream
Natsuki looks overworked..
CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM: Use a wider aspect ratio. It's great on newer phones, because it fills the screen. I personally would love it this way with this amazing cinematography.
I need clarification. Is there too much volcano or not enough?
Wow you are burning me up! Hot guys, hot volcano, hot spring, hot song…
That rap actually bops LOL btw nice video, these vlogs are really entertaining.
Amazing cinematography. You've done it Chris. You've become the next Martin Scorsese. I would say Chris Nolan, but you know.
Does anyone else  hear Joey screaming when Natsuki says "Danger volcano" 🤣🤣🤣🤣
that song was so good it makes up for them missing the first challenge lol
*W H E E Z E*
Awesome, awesome! I foresee many remixes of Too Much Volcano in the future.
This video is just sooo damn good. I haven't enjoyed a video this much in ages. Plus the fact that Aso sounds like 'Asshole' wasn't exactly a hindrance haha. As a bonus, the sulfur gas also reminded me of a Dr Stone episode where it gassed 10 people to death. So it's probably (hopefully) a less concentrated kind. And that rap song was just incredible  P.s I'm always impressed with Natsukis English so I wonder where he learned it, since it's pretty obvious that English education in Japan sucks. Unless you have a Chris-esque teacher
The production value of this video is through the roof.
Make this available on iTunes; the world needs more volcano 🌋
Too much Volcano slaps
Oh my God this was amazing. That rap was the best thing ever. Make it an official music video. 10/10 best rap of 2021.  Can't wait to see the next episode!
the chorus of that song was actually catchy 💀💀 I loved every second of it. nice work guys!!
Excellent rap! Just a shame Japan isn't in the Eurovision Song Contest, or good be going interstellar.
I continue to be smitten by Natsuki. Be still my ❤️.
I dig joeys Junji Ito sweater, I miss natsukis pirate pants and I hope chris has some drip coming up
That rap video was INCREDIBLE! I freaking love it and now I gotta add it to my music playlist, thank you for gracing us with this masterpiece
You guys are awesome!
Loved every minute if the rap!! Too much volcano. 🌋 😍 Cant wait for the next adventure guys! Love you Natsuki 💖
My God! I love the rap song! I mean can you be any more creative.  I very much enjoy your videos and you actually made me so psyched to visit Japan.
When's the spotify release
Q U A L I T Y ! ! ! ! !
Loved the rap song, wish I could download it and have it as my ringtone.
NATSUKIIIIIIIII 💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
Ngl, I genuinely like the rap song
It's been a day and "A-S-O so much volcano" is still stuck in my head...what have you done to me Chris...
so happy to see you all travelling again. love the videos.
That rap was 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Now lets all remember theses are cheaper than disney hotels.
So when's Too much volcano getting uploaded seperately so I can add it to my playlist? :^)
Please release too much volcano on Spotify 😂😂
Kyushu, yeah - please stay in FUK for some time and do not miss Wagyu in Miyazaki, please please
This was fuckin awesome!
This was so funny
Worth
My favorite video so far. Thank you so much
I still cant believe that a random chance meeting in a little Japanese village many years ago lead to some of the best content around today and a superstar that is Natsuki hahahahaha.
What a great video
Someone better send too much volcano to Calli.
Don't worry natsuki I also wake up everyday and hope for aso. I never get any though.
Glad for THE  day
The rap song isnt even bad tbh
Too much volcano 🌋🌋. That was brilliant 😂 love the simple lyrics and the effort into it . Fantastic dancing  natsuki and Joey and of course  camera work chris 🤣
The igloos looks like mmo housing.
love the song, love the video <3
I love the funk in this 😂😂👌🏼🤍
The rap video was the funniest thing I've seen in a long time, brilliantly done within the time frame available,  completely made my day 🤣 Keep up the good work guys, I'm sure a record deal is in the making 😁🎶
Fantastic editing, this channel has gotten SO GOOD
I love absolutely your videos...but every time I watch one I end up hungry for food that is unattainable here in Europe...damn!
Glad  to see you back in Aso farm village. I'm also glad you returned this time without that dogshit tash and goatie. Great videos 👍
Great video and really funny music clip, but where was Chris?? The Abroad in Japan community needs more Dave in Japan rap videos!
What a great fucking banger
Nice inclusion of the Wilhelm Scream
Amazing guys ! That was hell of a challenge and you did a great job in making that clip in such a short time ! Those video maker challenges are the one you perform the best I think ! Pretty sure that when going to sleep I will still have those lyrics in mind haha ♫ A - S - O...♫ Long live Abroad in Japan !
Seems like there endless things to go in Japan like a huge amusement park
Too much volcano available on Spotify when????  Low key it was actually good
Epic in so many ways! Please use the thumbs  up. The only way is up.
I absolutely love when you three go on an adventure. Seriously the best entertainment. Brilliant rap. Very funny!
Honestly though, that rap video was really good XD
Song is trending #1 on iTunes 😉
I really could see all of them do a special take on the 80 days aroind the world like Michael Palin in their own style which would be brilliant just like the journey across japan series have been
Been looking forward to Too Much Volcano since Chris mentioned it in a livestream! It did not disappoint!
Best rap song ever!
Kurokawa black river like these tatami. Chris jumps in the onsen. Tsunami!  Ly really 😋
Formidable trio and masterclass video! I really hope journey across japan never ends.
That song is by far leagues better than the idiocy that passes for music nowadays! 8/10.
Enjoyed the rap video, well done for putting it together in such a short time.
I will be disappointed if I wake up tomorrow and too much volcano is not number 1 on itunes.
Tomorrow's earworm cheers
the rap was lovely :)
Best rap ever.
Loved the rap video 😂😂😂👍
This rap for sure makes for the previous day failed challenge, good sht
I paused at 19:33 and my brother just asked me who elon musk is sitting next to. I-
Ngl the rap is pretty heat
More Raps!!!  that was brilliant!
Omg that rap, I laughed so hard. 10/10 video honestly.
Man its like some uni friends making a project for fun but it turns out too good at the end because you put your heart and soul into it. I'm really missing Ryatoro though, wish he would appear in any episode as well.
Chris, you make me contemplate turning off my adblock.
7:00 i was thinking the same, like old memory from a theme park that you kind of enjoyed as a kid but now feels weird like something is off about it
Best Rap I've ever heard!
When Sasha baron Cohen takes his face off it’s natsuki under.
So much volcano
Absolutely killing it Chris. Shame you weren’t in the rap!
How does Joey make it to trash tastes when hes on the other side of japan
Now I need "To much Volcano" on Spotify 😂
Fresh prince in bel-air. eat your heart out.
Noooo that was just the right amount of volcano 🔥🔥🔥 Also the baths! 😍
Far beyond embarassing. ^_^
Too much Volcano
Buddha Brand 2
Volcano in my pants when Natsuki does dance 💃🏼! This is so great. I‘m sad that Journey Across Japan is coming to an end 😢
I love this series so much! The production on this is top notch and I believe rivals some of the bigger budget productions out there! You guys continue to impress keeping this series both educational and fun all at the same time. Congrats on another great episode and I’ll definitely be humming “So Much Volcano C’MON!” Throughout my day 😂👏🏽
Chris, I’m inserting this here in hopes of gaining your attention in regards to a bit of a contention that’s developed under another of your excellent videos between me and a Natalie Ramirez.  It’s the one where Kazu meets you on the hilltop of Matsuyama with oranges.  She feels I have egregiously crossed a line in how I spoke to you as a reply to her post praising Kazu, well deserved praise I might add.  Natalie takes great umbrage with what I said to you there. Keep in mind that I’m 77, never had grand children (sadly) and am old enough to be your grandfather.  And bare in mind that all I wrote there is motivated by sincere affection for you and Natalie. Have a look Sir, would you? (We’re not all bad over here in America, just most of us, lately.) PS: Natalie’s post is near the top.  Won’t have to scroll down much.
Best episode so far; amazing rap!
I'm confused, is there too much volcano or is there no volcano?  Haha honestly I love this vid so much
Just for the algorithm, because I really love the series! Cheers!
That Village looks like Akira Toriyama's house style on Namek in Dragon Ball Z (and the capsule pods)
I liked the Rap song!
Best challenge yet
12:48 damn covid. I planed to visit kurokawa Onsen in autumn 2020...
It's a shame you aren't back in the UK Chris, that would've won us Eurovision for sure.
10/10 cinematography on the rap song Chris! Unbelievable you came up with all those shots within 9 hours. You have talent.  For the lyrics tho, Can't say I would've been able to do any better, but let's say it's "developing". Enjoyed it a lot though!
I've been to the dome houses, I loved it! One of my favorite memories.
tell my why the rap song actually went hard
I think the Igloo village would be a cool place to live, but not for $100 a night
Another amazingly edited video Chris. Actually insane stuff
I watched the music video before i watched this, was wondering wtf ASO stood for *facepalm*
This is just as good as Dr. Jelly!
Wow ... Your face is so big now 😱
You didn’t add a C to rap I would say. Sterling job lads👍
LSS! (Insert Natsukis line: A-S-O too much volcano 🎶 ) hahahaha good job guys!
Love this soo much lmaooo
I was enjoy and love the places they go to! :D
Looking forward to some Too Much Volcano shirts
That rap video was rather good, especially considering you only had a few hours to come up with it. Also had an 80s vibe, especially with the hint of electro. Good job! That tag line though, certainly earworm worthy, lol.
So when can I get their debut album?
Kickin' it in lockdown, chillin' on my phone Watching Chris, Jo and Nat rappin' bout Aso I didn't think them serious; I really didn't know - But pizza made it in the rap along with volcanoes (say what?)  I'm done.
It’s a triumph!
The song was actually pretty good.
Please tell me so much volcano is on Spotify and itunes
That bath inn looks amazing
Me all night:   A S O too much volcano
I have actually done a research paper on Kumamoto and Kumamon for college and it’s such an amazing place with an interesting mascot.
Always enjoy the series, especially when you drunk!
This was the best challenge ever🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Great work guys !
What drone have u got is it a dji or something
Natsuki is pure and good and I would definitely follow him to mount doom
My only criticism is that there was too much volcano in this episode. No volcano.
You can have too much volcano, but never enough Abroad in Japan! Well done guys
Tatooine, definitely looks like tatooine and also, that rap song is how the kids would say … “Caught on fire” ? 😂 🔥 🤷🏾‍♂️
so good rap
I need "Too much Volcano" on Spotify NOW🙌
This turd has the most English face of all time. It’s like someone pasted a British mans face on a mediocre potato.
When’s the rap available on Spotify then?🤣🤣 that was fantastic
I fucking love JAJ, especially with Joey and Natsuki. But I’d also like to see Ryotaro, Sharla, Pete and whoever has been featured in the first JAJ. Wondering how it’d be with all of them together. Probably chaotic.
Why no Risottoro?
Now this is rap I can get behind! Mainly for Natsuki's confidence in himself somewhat awkward English. But I love that about him... so yah...
awesome rap guys. will make top of the opos, if it still existed!
Ngl, that rap is miles better than any music on the radio nowadays 😂
You guys did a really great job with the rap song. You're videos are always extreme quality mate keep them up as I assume you will .
Absolutely loved the rap ❤️
Really good content Chris! Good work
I'm disappointed, write a rap about your day, how lame! I'm only excited in the ones that torture our cast, how is a rap torture? Lame...
too much volcano is going to be the classic futurefunk hit of 2021
When Natsuki said "So much volcano, no volcano"..... I felt that
Positive vibes. Love you guys. Thanks for another day.
Can i get ASO too much volcano on vinyl?
ngl, im a little disappointed the rhyme from 9:40 did not make it into the final rap
I'll be singing "A S O - so much volcano" in my head during all of my afternoon meetings now.
That rap was so much better than I expected. 😂
Alright I found myself a new ringtone!  Well done guys it was great!
that's so old school :D
Too Much Volcano is my favorite song now. XD
The rap was good!! Make more!!👍👍😁
Which app did you use for making the beats for this song? 😊 🌿
Wellp this song is going to randomly pop up in my head over the coming weeks. So thanks for that I guess😂
Amazing video, amazing rap, no volcano is my new mantra
ASO no volcano will now be stuck in my head.
Too Much Volcano is cringenley delicious.
Rap was great!!!! Hahahahahahah!!!!! Keep it up, mastas!
awesome rap song!! lol 😂
Poggers in the onsen cave
Tbh, I'd like to buy a single album of Too Much Volcano & merch of 'the three degrees of Japanese' [Non-Japanese, half-Japanese, full Japanese]
The rap was simply amazing
Great work as always guys!
Enjoyed the episode. That "rap song" was hilarious 😂😂
For about 9 hours of work, that rap is not bad at all.
Blinding video guys...loved it x
joey entering into bathtubs is starting to feel like a coping mechanism for when he's faced with a new home
That's a beautiful Onsen but $1000 a night!
Too much 🔥🔥🔥
Haven't enjoyed a video this much in such a long time. Keep it up fellas!
Sounded like Grandmaster Flash And The Furious Five, but... Not as good.
The song is lowkey a banger haha
Great job!
The animeman sounds like the prince of bel air :)
A S O  Too much volcano.  It’s stuck in my head.
Great video with an equally great rap clip in the end! Loved it!
Beat is pretty banger Sir Chris!
Better 100$ hotel than I've ever stayed in.. Even with the weirdness.
It was completely brilliant lads!
What is this fascinating dream wonderland?   It's like a Disney film set.
ASO…too much volcano in me and my husband's mind already LOL. So much fun this episode😆. Brilliant 😎👍.
😹🌋
23:14 Joey even had the rap choreography
This is truly the peak of human civilisation.
Joey totally channelling The Fresh Prince
Sugoi!
The Trash Taste subreddit going to LOVE that rap
What an absolute banger!
The only difference between 'To much volcano' and a real rap song are the missing special effects in the video. Otherwise it was as good as any other rap song.
That rap song is dope guys ! Good job !
Yo the rap song is actually soo good and the cinematography 😍 i was actually impressed by the intro of the rap song, the transition is so good
Always fucking place… why me
I already can not wait for the next video Keep it up
When  is this banger coming on spotify? its going straight to my playlist
Two hours later and A S O, so much volcano is still stuck in my head XD Amazing
That was pretty friggin good for a challenge. Nailed it. That is going to #1 on the Billboard charts. .. A S O.
Natsukis chorus is catchy as hell nice job yall
I dare say this is the BEST ''rap song'' EVER!! xD
Rap video is awesome 😂😂 I almost fell out my chair
This is like the dream vacation with the boys, and it’s amazing.
OOOOH my gooood I am in love with that rap!
I like that Joey raps like "My name is Joey and I'm here to say // I like to rhyme in an anime way"
Shit slaps bois
This probably is one of the best videos on the channel. Love it.
loved the song, listened to it at least 5 times, it is insanly catchy and funny
I seriously need the Junji Ito jumper Joey is wearing 😍
There's some really professional editing in this video, it's like something you'd see on tv.
Y’all did so good with the rap!  I found myself dancing to it hahaha
I've been waiting for this!
Can't remember the last time I was so excited for a youtube series
That was shabbing fantastic .
I'm crying, the song is killer :D
Omg you guys are so funny and cute I love it!!
Wow, that rap song far exceeded what I was expecting! As someone who doesn't typically enjoy rap I'm proud to say Too Much Volcano is now my favorite rap song.
Anyone recognise the bgm around 10:10?
21:36 gangnam style !!!!!!! hahaha xD
Get more views on this
👏 Great team work with the rap video, thumbs up for Joe's lyrics and singing, Chris's filming and Natsuki's always present good vibes.
Loved the song! ☺️
This is way better than what they got on Discovery Channel.
just realized Journey Across Japan has huge Yakuza like a Dragon energy, we have the excellent "the boys, the gang, the brotherhood" vibe, and 2 of them are middle-aged, and they do some very wacky shit, and it's in japan, this is fantastic. I love this series.
If I had a nickel for every rap I've watched on the Abroad in Japan channel, I'd have two nickels  Which isn't a lot, but it's weird that it happend twice.
Natsuki is a fucking legend man
this was a fun episode
eminem aint got shit on these lads
hello chris just wanted to say thank you for making these videos because they're the only thing making me happy watching on youtube, keep it up!
the song is actually pretty good hahaha great job guys!
ASO - NO VOlCANO :D  GOOD JOB, I love it!!!
Joey seems to always struggle to get into an onsen
The rap song at the end was way better than it had any right to be. But can there ever really be too much volcano?
Dude, the amount of content quality you‘ve been emitting lately is phenomenal! Loved the sceneries, the mix of fun scenes and the more serious ones where you explain things. Natsuki is definitely also playing a big role, he‘s so sympathetic! Last but not least the Rap Challenge, fits perfectly into the episode. One of my favourite Youtube Channels, thanks mate! 👏🏻🙏🏼
I want to be like Natsuki when I grow up
Awesome! Am loving the episodes! Stay away from those Cessnas though..seriously bad for your health 😂! Cheers guys!
So much Volcano
Spotify release when?
Natsuki you madman, Redbull before bed??
I love how the lyrics simultaneously describe how there is so much volcano but also no volcano at the same time.
Too much valcoano!! So good... Well... Don't give up YouTube just yet... Thanks (as always) for a super entertaining video! Cheers!!!
Every episode it's just getting better and better
Awesome video😂, love your content Chris!!! I'm so excited for the next one🤩🤩
Joey got flow goddamn. And Chris' beat and Natsuki's chorus were 👌
That song single-handedly gave my immune system the boost it needs to fight the Cold that I'm currently down with.
me has  a bad day - a new journey across japan video - instantly feeling better c:
Ok, that definitely beats "Deer Bear Boor." Ryotaro has to u phis game... The video was epic also.
Challenge completed hands down!!! Bravo!!! 👏🏼🎉
I doubt Chris will ever see this, since I'm not anybody popular and youtube's algorithms hate that, but were you aware that the shirt Joey wears occasionally (5:43 for instance) is for a hentai (2D porn) site? Did he bring that just to mess with you? I mean, wear what you want, but god forbid an innocent viewer googles that out of curiosity ...
Chris Broad’s naughty Journey Across Japan featuring some extra salami. 🤣
6:25 is that building to the south the first erection of the village
ASO TOO MUCH VOLCANOOO
Bromate and Natsuki are epic road trip buddies. It would be epicly awesome to travel with those two.
Best rap song I’ve heard all day.
I legit enjoyed the mellow tones of Too much Volcano.
when's the release of To much Volcano ?
That Wilhelm Scream.
Ha ha ha 😂 you're good!
Volcano song has Huge Luke million  - Arnold vibes
I'd like to see Chris and Jeremy Clarkson do a race across Japan.
Thanks for the earworm.  Great episode guys!
Will too much volcano be available on Spotify? And as a standalone music video on Yt?
Yessss, this rap is lit, like hot flowing magma! Great vid, as always <3
pls can you release to much volcano as a song on Spotify i need this in my music playlist!!
Something nice
Wow. Wowowowow. And props to Wilhelm who screamed! 👏🏻 👏🏻 👏🏻
Chris begun to unleash his inner David Attenborough at 9:52
Natsuki really makes everything funny and exiting😂...nice rap guys👍
for real this was just fantastic and a blast to watch
Legit bars spat on this here rap song. BRAVO. Nice flow and the chorus worked too! Very impressed. 🤟
aww yeahhh!!
A S O  So much volcano~
how much volcano is too much volcano? not enough volcano. now thats deep.
Please release the Official Rap Video as a separate video on youtube, it was amazing :)
Joeys rap game on point 🔥
Is there too much volcano, or not enough volcano?
I think I have just found our next Japan destination
too much volcano... well.. soo is there a spotifylink?
This was brilliant! loved and had so much fun watching this episode! keep up the good work guys :)
Good video and WOW, the rap was brilliant and super professionel.
Loved it!
Talk about amazing content here, with the rape song I never knew I needed.
Beautiful cinematography, perfect to watch on our new 4k TV.
Incredible.
I’m surprised how well the rap turned out.
It’s actually good
Damn that looked like fun, hopefully Natuski is enjoying the distraction from his normal grind.
I fucking love the rap!!! Joey needs to keep practicing. His cadence and flow could be top notch with a little practice. I was smoking a huge joint and fucking coughed my ass off laughing so hard!!!
Unironically loved the song. Keep up the good work nippon trio.
Got Will Smith rap vibes from that 🤣 10/10 lads
Too much Volcano.
rap was fire
Omg that rap video was so good 😅😁💪
I love you guys! I enjoyed everything very much. Well done on the rap. I’ve got it stuck in my head now. Can’t wait for the next episode. Keep up the good work. You’re brilliant x
A S O .... so much Volcano will be my new ring tone. btw i love your Journey videos. Entertaining and informative. Tbh i really enjoyed your documentary phase when you were rocking that beard about 3 years ago i think. Are you planning something similar in the future or did it not generate enough views for the work you had to put in?
Couldn't stop laughing 🤣🤣🔥🔥🔥 absolutely incredible
Why does the intro tune remind me of Living in a Box by Living in a Box, I cannot unconvince myself and even sing the bloody lyrics....
That intro music gets me every time
Came for the views of Japan, stayed for the awesome rap!! PS: maybe Brittain should sent you guys to Eurosong next time ;P
Right, I'm sold. Japan for the next Eurovision wildcard entry...
Okay, but like can I get this on iTunes.
10/10 it was hilarious
I would unironically listen to Too Much Volcano. It's got a great beat.
I almost spit out my drink at, "I hope for Aso".
I went into lyrical analysis of "Too much Volcano" and found out why Natsuki gave it its name... because it's straight up fire 🔥🔥🔥  Seriously, the dance moves, the lyrics, the rhythm, the editing... i expected funny garbage and got funny gold! And it kinda reminds me (especially the first verse) of the prince of bel air opening song 😄
What a goddamn jam <3 haha
I absolutely love the IGLOO hotel. Perfect for one person who stays alone, Love at first sight for me. In fact, if i ever get my own house I might model it like these.
Add that to the album with "cycle bicycle", or just release a series of single LP's since records are hekkin back in style. Lets get the fund for Journey Accross Japan#4 started, folks!
The huts look like those from DragonBall Z
Amazing ! Me and my girlfriend have been watching you for years and this goes straight into my top 5 favourite episodes !   Too much volcano 🤣 . Mate please 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 .   Please never give up ! Your the best Japan youtuber there is . Always giving us REAL entertainment that's pretty much BBC worthy .  You asked for kind comments . So there's one for you mate .   10/10 Chris
oh no, it's stuck in my head... ASO too much volcano;;;;;
damn that rap song reminded me of Ryan Higa's parody music videos. It's really well-made for something so off-hand and working with such limited yet resourceful resources too.
Danger volcano!!
Ok, that preview is next level.
Not gonna lie, that was actually a pretty decent song lol.
Liked for Tabaccotage
„Too much volcano“ - brilliant. 😂 The rapsong made my day. 😆
Too Much Volcano: the only rap song that is both the best and worst rap song of all time. 😁 Keep up the good work, your videos are great!
4:50 This is the weirdest bathtub I've seen.... wait what about the log and the pot 🤔 😂😂😂😂😂
Wait why is the music video so damn good 😂
how you come from the Igloo Village to the smurfs ?? I mean they look totally like the houses in the Dragonbal Universe to me xD
A S O Too Much Volcano!! cool.. It's catchy
The rap song is hilarious and surprisingly catchy, "too much volcano" 😆
Marvellous xx
I glad I get to come back and Watch your channel after over a year since the first lockdown
joey can rap for sure
Joey really improved his rap skills! Good for him!
Please please PLEASE release too much volcano!! I need this to be the anthem of my life!!!
I think Natsuki could be Japan’s counterpart to Korea’s Psy
Great fun! Thanks. I’ll be shabbing all day,
🙈it was actually really catchy for a rap that was so quickly made
最高 ラップ
DId anybody else get a Blonde Boyz by Cyndago theme to the rap song lmao
I can see rappers killing themselves after listening to this rap cause of laughter and jealousy
Great Rap Song. Great video. 👊🔥🇬🇧
The homes in the village remind me of the capsule houses in Dragon Ball
18:30 shabu shabu !!!    =D .....   love it!
this is quality content.
don't mind me, just SHABBIN WITH THE BOYS
Trio fantastico, too much volcano 🌋, had my foot tapping to the beat, overall great job, lyrics, backing track and video shots blend into a well oiled machine.  Looking forward to the next episode.
As always, Natsuki was the main attraction
0:54 I loved this weirdly fancy tracking shot! XD
chris voice cracked when he said "say something nice " thats how dedicated he is man, love this fuckin channel
man i really love this series
Joey seems to love getting into things like bathtubs and such.. like a cat XD
Damn, that rap was really entertaining
You all are a national treasure. One day I'll make it to Japan. Love all your videos. They are great.
That opening shot of Joey during Too Much Volcano was kinda hard tho
Great video cool rap👏👏👏
the igloo village looks straight out of dragon ball. its a ghost town because goku hasnt shown up and told oolong to stop terrorizing it yet.
Did not expect that level of quality in the rap. Well done, guys. Also, Joey's face when he's awkardly humping the air haha
Killer rap guys!!!! Too much volcano, indeed 🌋🌋🌋
So I need a too much volcano tshirt plz and thanks
Super fun to watch and loved the rap song!
That Wilhelm scream was a cherry on top of the genius composition of a sundae 👌
That was best rap song I ever had pleasure to experience.
The whole video flowed like a river (or volcano) and they smashed the challenge. Very enjoyable.
Lol not gonna lie, that was an awesome rap and really love how watching these episodes makes you feel apart of the journey thanks for letting me live vicariously through you guys! A S O
A S O TOO MUCH VULCANO

Superb! Carry on!!

Unironically the rap was pretty fire.
waiting for a world tour concert!!!
<3<3<3<3<3<3<3
Petition to make Natsuki one of Japan's national treasures... put that pretty face on a bill
Gotta say, that Beard and Moustache looked quite handsome couple years back.
Great rap song, cool visuals and catchy lyrics, the embodiment of rap!
Cheers guys! Funny as fook!!
So, is anyone gonna tell me what app did he use to make the beat?
wilhelm scream was a fantastic little touch
This better be on Apple music and at the tope of the charts.
The Wilhelm scream caught me off guard xD
15:45 anyone else is dying to walk to the edge behind the bath?
That's gonna be stuck in my head for a while
Me: at the gym on the stair stepper looking like an actual crazy person giggling at Abroad while in exercise pain (exercise pain = self inflicted so somehow worst)
Volcanos song is Flight of Conchords-ish!
I love the song! Turned out a lot better than I expected! Also, Joey's dance in the igloo camp is too f ing funny
Best Wilhelm Scream placement in the music video :-D
No volcano.
Great video
I need "too much volacano" on spotify!
Great great great fucking song . Good job guys!!!
This series is absolutely amazing.
Brilliant !!!! Keep it coming !!!!
That was incredible. Downloadable version of the rap pls
That rap is catchy af!!
Guys! You did a fantastic rap!
Thank you for bringing this  masterpiece to my playlist, it's right after "I have a bad case of dieria"
If Top Gear was written and produced on Acid you would get this.
Song is a banger to be fair
私はこの歌が欲しい　！ 大好きです😍！
I need to have this song!! Love it 🥰🥰
mad props to the filming , the drone shots to the rap song footage everything was on point , simply beautiful to watch
my family is from... right here... I've been here...
"Elon Musk would love it" Aha! You start to look like him and now you are considering things from his perspective
Looks like so much fun trip. And I wouldn’t have guessed Jelly has such rap skills! Awesome video!
Me like japanese Elon Musk (づ｡◕‿‿◕｡)づ
Love the rap song and loving the Chris Natsuki and joey trio for this journey across Japan it has all of Chris usual greatness while Natsuki keeps me laughing and Joey provides the eye candy lol
I'm absolutely cackling at the ASO rap 🤣🤣🤣
That Rap was fire :OOO XD
90es rappers
21:24 - Too much volcano ;)
Natsuki is 50 years old and smokes 20 cigarettes per day and still looks more fit than Chris and Joey
ASO. Too much volcano.
ASO - Mr Volcano Wide
What is the music at 14:20 - 14:40? No music apps can find it.
Best series of youtube 2021
Natsuki always says the most random things and I love it
I love it💕! Specially the process to do the video x3. Bjt the song was great. I thought it would be a disaster, but it was so great to get a Grammy😄
No vocanou
Here before 2 mch volcano makes it to the billboard top 100
I'm really not a big fan of rap BUT this rap was great Is it gonna be on spotify?
That music video was surprisingly good
Austin Powers and the spy who shabbed me
That rap is going to be stuck in my  head for a while. Not complaining,  just stating facts.
It wasn't that bad lol
A S O  TOO MUCH VOLCANO
Excuse me… thats unironically a banger of a track. It’s made up for Chris’ failure the “day” before.
I LOVE THIS SO MUCH
Release the music video as its own video
The rap was a thing of great delight
The volcano rap was epic! But why weren’t you in it Chris??
Great job with the rap lads! 😎😎😎👍
Keep up the great work man! Its thanks to your videos that I became interested in Japan and will be going there for two weeks at the beginning of June next year. I love the humor in your videos it cracks me up.
4:45 - Joey's inner animal is a cat. He just climbs into everything without hesitation and claims it. Also like how you have the largest vehicle and Natsuki jumps in the front seat
My day was as Chris might say "A bit sh@#". Watching this video brought a smile to my face, the video was awesome and hilarious, thanks fellas 😅
Can I get this in ringtone form? Total ear worm 😆
EXTRA SALAMI!
Lol, of course they made a good rap, they had natsuki, a person who spends their off time of cutting hair to make music. All hail natsuki.
Natsuki had pen pineapple apple pen vibes during his rap
They killed it! Way to go guys that was great and the sites were so cool!
Fuck, i got the chorus stuck in my head.
The slightly dodgy but interesting igloo had to have been worth it if it meant a private hot spring bath and a cold beer 🍻 great video, natsuki looked delighted the entire time
Great work guys! Love the rap video 😎 wonderful how you guys fixxed this without losing your typical identity. Could be a new hit. Looking forward to the next video!
I just suddenly started to love the rap. You guys need to band together and create an album in different regions of Japan. Amazing.
Loved it and now Too Much Volcano is stuck in my head. Thank you. 😳
where is spotify link?
It was great
What was the app he used?
I like the added touch of the Wilhelm scream. Bravo!
Why was the Rap song actually a banger haha :P
fue hermoso
It was actually really good.. surprisingly
Your rap song was surprisingly good. I'm sure it will go viral.
Put the rap on Spotify!!
They should train people for going to Venus on that volcano.
Release only the MV part pls.
I appreciate that nothing On this channel is low effort everything is maximum quality
You guys actually killed it with the rap song.
21:12 Too Much Volcano Rap Video
Why does the song sound like it was recorded 30 years ago haha... Instant classic!
Wait for me Chris
That song was fantastic, I loved it. :D
No rap video is complete without the Wilhelm scream.  10/10
Omg, that song was everything! 😭😭😭🤣🤣🤣😭😭😭🤣🤣🤣
You guys seem to attract weirdly shaped bathtubs like magnets
To much volcano is a art now, thanks natsuki Joe chirs  For my new ringtone , wow 🔥
That rap was better then the US ones...
Casually breaking the internet again
The song was both bad in a good way and good in a bad way.
LOVE THE RAP!!
Summer hit XDDDDDDDD
Damn, this rap song is actually pretty good! "Too much Volcano" can be the new summer hit.
Better than Eurovision.
Another great challenge completed with style guys
Great life long friends, enjoying a spiritual journey with volcanos an extra salami tatamis is the video i needed today. Very well done <3
Amazing, was looking forward to the rap song throughout the video, an you guys didn't disappoint! You made my day! I'm putting it way up there with the Dr. Jelly ads :D
A sign of the film maker genius extraordinaire that is Chris Broad, couldn't resist adding the wilhelm scream. Watch out Scorsese!
This channel keeps getting better and better
10s all around
soooooo mcuh volcan o nice
I was expecting the rap to be a lot worse💀
Brilliance rap song. 😂🤣😂🤣
the rap was unexpectedly good lol
Great music video….more please!😎🙈👊🏾
So Much Volcano is my new cycling music 🎶
staying in a room with black tatami/shabbing with the homies shabu shabu umami/kurokawa waters in my kurokami/if I stay here forever, who can fault me  :)
Haha man I gotta love the 80s vibes in that rap.
What a wholesome experience  I love this videos they help me to space out
Bloody wonderful.
So much work for that one challenge. awesome
Thank you for teaching us about ASO So much Volcano. No Volcano. Nowhere. The beat was lovely :)
As someone who enjoys rap, that was really good!
Another amazing episode! Props to Joe for the amazing lyrics, keep em coming!
You should upload the rap song separately on the channel so ppl can loop it 100x in a row. ASO.
It needs to be on itunes download!!!!!!
You guys just cured my temporary depression <3 <3 <3 <3
I now have this song stuck in my head. That means it was at least an alright song
I get so excited for every one of these episodes now. I can't wait to eat my  chicken while watching Natsuki sing a volcano rap
I hate rap but Natsuki made that really adorable.
I'm not gonna lie that rap was super catchy lol this and the doctor jelly commercial are a match made in heaven
Made me smile and laugh, but it is a great rap.👍😊
So f**king crazy yeah!!!
Gotta upload that music video as it's own video
Holy shit - my new ring tone it is :)
Abroad in Japan's videos are honestly the best around. Nowhere else have I found the production quality, great chemistry between characters and basically feeling like you're in Japan.
Hey its that one anime man!
You had me at Natsuki
Shinigami rhymes with black tatami. That's a cool thing you can rap about.  Sincerely, a fucking weeb.
Aso Farm Village would be perfect for filming a remake of "The Prisoner"
The rap tune you made is really catchy! love you gys! xx
Rap song was fun ,lol, enjoyed the video as usual. The travel videos are your best
🤣🤣🤣 best rap song ever!🤣
Waiting for Too Much Volcano to drop on Ikkuru
I could so live in one of those foam huts, I would just need a bigger bed than the ones provided. Enjoying the series.
Too much volcano on Spotify please
Epic rap song!! Great job!! <3
Only one question: Is the windscreen wiper still on the car?
The rap was ridiculous, cringeworthy and I was 100% here for it 💚
I'm definitely adding these locations to my list of places to visit as soon as we can travel again!
Natsuki is a friggin national treasure.
So much loaded in my brain now 🎵 🕺 🌋 ♨️🅰️ S 🅾️
I hate how genuinely catchy the song is. It's going to be in my head all day
Chris, you should consider a career in music production. That was a really nice jam.
YEEEEEESSSSSSSSS
Love the rap
Glad that dish isn't named shaggu shaggu, that's would have been awkward !
Something nice.
awesome video and a great rap song to booth keep it up you guys :D
My 3 year old daughter has made me rewind to much volcano 4 times so she could dance to it.
Something Nice
Man, the quality of that Rap
Why is this not on spotify??!??!?🤪🤪🤪
i wanted chris to rap as well
they look like capsule houses from Dragonball Z
Alright for 9hrs that song Fcking Slaps.
A S O, TOO MUCH VOLCANO
I am commenting to increase this video's engagement metrics.
don't quit your day jobs but that  pretty was good!!!   great fun.
too much volcano on spotify when?
One of the better rap videos I've seen, lol.
The rap video turned out pretty well! Amazing footage 👏
The rap had an awesome 80's rap vibe guys. I was genuinely surprised by the quality and especially by the fact that Joeys voice and rap are a really good fit. Keep it lit (like a volcano) or whatever the cool kids say nowadays.
Reject igloo house, return to onsen cave
Wow, Aso looks rad. And the Rap's pretty catchy
I'm terribly disappointed. Chris you mentioned you could beat box. Where's the beat box??
10/10 on the rap song guys, 8 of them goes to Joey for the great rap! Best challenge completed to this day. Joey when's the album coming out?
Top video, really enjoy seeing parts of Japan that are less well-known. More Onsens and music videos please.
I find myself rooting for Natsuki to have a fantastic holiday after watching the vid about how hard he works.
13:19 oh shit i stayed at the exact same room with my family back in december 2019 wtf
Been following this channel since its early days, when there was only a few youtubers in Japan . Woulf be fun to watch one of this videos spoken in Japanese, kudos from Portugal
Dude the music video was so good! Even a catchy song
haha the song is amazing :D
That rap video is better than 99% of the current rap videos being produced right now. Great episode boys. Keep up the good work.
This was fantastic, I never knew there would be a rap song I didn't know I'd never need.
This slaps
The awkward way Joey is dancing at 23:16 is fucking hilarious
Hopefully we'll see dr jelly as a guest soon
Brilliant content, thanks for cheering up my Monday guys 😂
that was actually a great song wtf
Golden.
If Natsuki is featured in every single youtube video ever... I am dead serious.... The world would be a better place.
Legit song and MV!
This Japanese guy is such a character 😆
THE THEME IS DOPE!
I’m from Kumamoto and this was so much fun to see. Thanks for highlighting Aso mountains and Kurokawa Onsen. My grandparents used to go from time to time so this was nice to see!
Amazing work as always, Chris!
something nice.
Nice to see Chris and the guys finally got a chance to ride the Ainori bus!
Im guessing that tourism was/is still dead in Japan so thats why the village is empty.
OMG I love it!!!
The rap was surprisingly decent, I was preparing myself for cringe - also I enjoy that the beat is like an 80s vibe.
If natsuki had the choice to live in either a house or a bath, i think he'd definitely choose a bath...
joey is so talented, of course natsuki is just amazing AF
シュールであれ、クオリティ高くて頭に残る傑作
This was freaking amazing 👏 thank you for the awsome entertainment allways!
Tatami TSUNAMI c'mon lads, it's right there (Natsuke saying "extra salami" was way funnier tho)
What's the name of the music app?
I'm just here for the rap.
Awesome content, amazing rap song, extremely entertaining! You guys are the best!
the rap video was amazing. made my day
Something nice. Honestly.
Funny how the cameraman is just invisible, and nobody talks about where the cameraman slept, Outside maybe??
Just curious if you thought about doing some sort of sweepstakes to include a subscriber on one of your travel videos?
😂😂😂
A-S-O
A S O Too much volcano... It should be in the charts bruh
Too much Volcano is a fun but dumb song to watch. What's important is that you guys and perhaps the viewers had fun!
Petition to make a  JOURNEY ACROSS JAPAN Always Fucking Place  t-shirt.
This video was really good. I think this makes a really good trio in your videos.
Was hoping it'd be done poorly so I'd have something mean to say to get your attention, but pretty solid quality for a 9 hour job! That rap needs to be released as a single, so it can just randomly pop up here and there. Thanks for bringing so much joy with your videos
This was a master piece. Thanks for the video.
Too much volcano in my head 💥💥🤪 ASO
ASO Farm Village, ASO Volcano, and the ASO spirit permeating through the ground.  When you think about it, lots of ASOs everywhere.  Another great video. I can not believe the production quality.  Keep it up. This is YouTube? JAJ, defining high quality videos for YouTube. Great job.
You guys gotta give yourselves more credit, that music video was amazingly good for being done in 9 hours. I was laughing and astounded the whole way through.
That rap song was better than half the stuff on YouTube!
Each episode of abroad in Japan deserved millions views
Get this song on spotifyyyy
Got both this video and you on Pete's Twich, what an awesome day!
rap was pog
Yeah so... Too Much Volcano will now be my ringtone. lol
I love the song you used at the end of this video... I remember hearing it in JAJ 2! It really does feel just like chilling with your boys in an onsen after a long day.
Yo what you're 30... You look like 26 wtf japan makes people look younger than they are
Need that "wheeze" Natsuki sweatshirt
major release when ?? i see Singels , Vinyl and world tour?
Best bath is the bath you have in your own house.. free
That grin Natsuki does after he sees his room is simply "like a magic". He looks so happy :D
Kumamoto is my favourite city for whatever reason
It's a legit good rap song!
I'm a rapper / musican and watching this was so much fun. You should really pursue your interest in producing music Chris. It would compliment your film production nicely and you clearly have an eye for it
Love waking up n smoking a fatty make some breakfast while watching this
that was actually a banger get natsuki a record deal
The fact that you guys made a music video in less than 24 hours and make it sound near decently is  most impressive!! Well done!!👍🏾
Natsuki sounds like Psy in Too Much Volcano
A S O! SO MUCH VOLCANO!!!!
I had no idea you could beatbox. You've become about 5000 times cooler.
Great RAP be proud of that one...Short timeline and the trio nailed it
th biggest question is: who's ghost holds the camera if chris, natsuki and yoey are all together in the shot?
THE GLOBLIN VILLAGE ( Chris, Natsuki, Jelly)
Guess I'll be humming *too much volcano*  all week
oh thank you now I can't shake A S O SO MUCH VOLCANO of my head
Who doesnt love the asshattery of these three combined <3
Hey im gonna be sending you an email about getting some advice about japan and learning to speak Japanese fluently along with my further education into university so if you see this please look out for my email thanks a lot for your time
After watching your "Too Much Volcano Rap" I love you More than ever!!!! The lyrics, the video are amazing! More! More! More!!! It's never Too Much AbroadinJapan 🌋
Chris, you look like youve lost weight, don't let the youtube bullies get to you. fat or not your videos are still entertaining. Keep the hits coming.
This is fire 🔥🔥
Too Much Volcano needs to be on Spotify
2:10 Always surprised that Chris can actually fucking beatbox.
When the first shot of the dome village came up I thought I was going mad over why I recognised it so much until you finally revealed that I'd seen it here 3 years prior. Also good job on the rap song. Very impressed by the production quality, especially given the time constaint
Our boy discovered Rytmik
Dislikes are from people who want more volcano.
Tbh the rap challenge isn't really much of a challenge... Rap & Punk are not that dissimilar as the best music from both genres use the exact same diy recording ethos... Natsuke being a punk himself this should have been a breeze.
3:50 It's depressing to see how empty a village like that is
12:48 what trees are those? the one with green yellow and red leaves
Wait you can beat box 🤯🤯🤯
I'm pretty sure you could use that song in an advert😂 too catchy
Ok so this season of journey across Japan is basically chris and joey enjoying their bath together😂😂
"ASO too much volcano". Now it's stuck in my head.
That rap is lit AF!!!
Wow I was jamming out real hard to the rap.. I really enjoyed it.
IT'S SO CATCHY THO
too much volcano no volcano no volcano  yes, natsuki at his best :D I love it
Aso 😂
The inclusion of the Wilhelm Scream. Chef's Kiss.
Totally catchy rap i have heard so far... kudos guys!
Objectively the best rap video ever made.
The production quality of that rap song is actually pretty great. It's catchy too.
Hahahaha let me SoundCloud that song tho
The song is actually quite good.
Hats off to you for bringing back the cheesy intro music!
i see a grammy in the horizon lol
I actually really loved the video. Thanks for the hard work.
So much Volcano! I feel too happy now :-)
Better than 99% of all rap songs I've ever heard.
The villa reminds  of dragon ball z
Uncore!!!!!! 😋
Joey already looks exhausted at the end x)
That rap was really well done!
that song is a bop
At this point I have no more words that I can use to praise your BEAST-like quality and content. Its just Extraordinarily Breathtaking ! From the shots to the transitions, from the quality to the compositions. You did an astounding job yet again !
The song was almost fire.
The Rap was Fantastic. love watching you guys. Learning about Japan and enjoying the laughs at the same time.
The rap is so good XD
Great job with the rap! EXTRA SALAMI!!!!
Oh my is is the guy living above him spamming the door button again
Not gonna lie that rap song and video editing is fucking amazing
So glad to see more of Natsuki!
Laaaaanaaaaaaa
The rap made me grin immensely.
We didint see Natsuki's second floor though. :(
The song is S-tier. The Aso-Yama spirits would be proud of you. Please release the music video as a stand-alone video! It’s gonna be an instant reshare from me!
OMG that is like totally S Club 7!
Excellent!!! :D
too much volcano on ITunes and no.1 on youtube music
A S O too much volcano...oh my God   LOL
Excellent production, suprisingly good lyrics, and the hilarity of the traveling sausage fest rapping about salami, aces all the way around
This need to be yearly event
Bruh, the cinematography on the rap was CRISPY. DAYUM!
This video is so much fun and great rap video!
I liked the rap song
Now, only if Ryotaro had been in this song!
damn that rap was better then I thought it was going to be
I thought Natsuki was going to do that Donald Duck scream again while rapping.
15:54 that rug really ties the room together!  Great video again, really want to visit these places! And that rap video is just epic!
A S O powaaaaaa
That was way catchier than it needed to be
"I can feel the spirits coming up through my feet"                                                                                        -Natsuki 2021
loved the video...the rap was Just aaagh i don't even have words😂😂
stunning video! your filming skill gets better and better. This video can be shown in a TV showroom really!
Im crying, this music video is quality. lmaoooo😂😂😂
I’ve legit heard way worse songs than that. That was pretty good ngl
Natsuki: - Good dancing Chris: *chuckles* - Debatable  Pretty good video again, the room with the onsen was pretty neat. Never heard of the Shabu Shabu.
Well Joey and Chris, if your YouTube careers don’t work out you have something to fall back on.😎 catchy song though👍 Keep up the good work
"Too much volcano" is my new go-to expression, replacing "Awesome" in my vocab.
Love the rap, was impressed by animation man.
Awesome work, Chris! Love the video and the song very much! Now I gotta put Too Much Volcano on loop till you upload the next episode. ASO!
Yo why does this song actually go HARD
the song ain't bad chris. 4/5 hahaha
This rap deeply resonates with me. Stuck at home for over a year, fully emersed in Abroad in Japan:  "So much Volcano! Too much volcano!"  Me a second later looking around to sadly realise - "No volcano! No volcano!"  Natsuki is a philosopher with great understanding of the human condition
Was waiting for this every single day haha 😅
Great work on the rap!
The rap needs to be its own video so I can put it on at parties.
it's looks a bit like a dragon ball capsule house :D
Watched rap part more than once. It was fun to listen and watch. Thanks guys!
Chickened out on the rap there then Chris! 🐔🐔🐔🐔🐔🐔🐔
Favorite rap song of 2021 so far! Great editing too hahaha
Did they film "You only live twice"  Bond movie there?  Looks very familiar.
The rap video was surprisingly good.
Go white boy go!!
This rap is actually way better than I expected especially since you did it in basically 9 hours (minus editing problably), I love it!
Something nice. Just kidding, that was truly adorable! Uhm, I mean manly and chartworthy of course.
How can I LIKE this video twice?  Abroad in Japan hands down is my favorite Youtube channel. Great job as always, Chris.
Natski said "Smurf village!" Am I the only one who understands this man's immaculate English and divine thought process?
The rap song is fantastic
I enjoyed that rap a little too much 🤣 and I was completely  convinced by natsuki's  performance,  joey kinda looked like a video girl in the onsen and natsuki was the actual rapper 🤣 well done guys!
What is that app Chris use to make the bgm? I wanna know XD
This TheAn1meMan guy raps almost like Ikurru
Natsuki feels like a very fun person to be friends with
Mans really need to make a vid with garnt
I've listened to to much volcano probably, six times today. God it's catchy!! I need it on Spotify
why is this channel so good? it shouldnt be legal
Your guys rocked that challenge!
When Natsuki said “Danger Volcano” I thought he said *DJ Volcano*
I wish I could see inside the big mushroom hut
Haha. Legendary!
Natsuki “I like hiking” Natsuki’s sweater “wheeze” 😂😂
👍🥰
When we were in Kumamoto last the castle walls were still in pieces being labeled. Then we stayed in Kurokawa too! Each of the ryokan are amazing. The one we stayed at had a similar multi-house set up for the different rooms and baths.
I never listen to rap but I thought that was well done getting in all the requirements and in a short time. :)  Nice.
Chris: "Was it good? Please... say something nice."  Me: "Something nice."
That rap sounded very 80s. Curious, was that the intention.
Great work guys🙏🏻🙏🏻
That rap is actually is pretty sick, all things considered.  Well done guys :)
Interesting
Looking for the kurokawa ryokan website , anybody got an idea . Give us the link Dave Borad.
in which onsen did you stay in ?
For something that was thrown together in 9 hours, that was a very good Rap Video.
Natsuki's part SLAPPED he needs to start making music 🎶
A S O ! ! ! what a hook!!!.
In all honesty i actually really really liked the rap song for only having 9 hours and like to kind of use what you had to do it was really good do not sell yourselves short. Another great video by the way i look forward to these every week like i would my favorite tv shows finding this channel has been a great thing for me and my friends to enjoy
There’s no such thing as too much volcano! Still, all I could think while watching is the amount of effort compared to most YouTube rubbish.
at first I didn't think the rap wouldn't be any good. but when I heard it I was really surprised how nice it sounds. you guys did a really good job all together
That rap is unironically good Like really
Very disappointed that Chris isn't in the rap song. Was looking forward to him trying to have some sort of rhythm :D
Is good, no volcano!
Catchy song, now it's stuck in my head 😄😄😄😄 I actually like it 😄😄😄 .... awesome video as always, keep them coming ... much luv from 🇰🇪
Where is the PRE-ORDER button for the upcoming album?!
After listening to "Too Much Volcano" I had a nightmare about falling into a volcano with that song as background music.
Rap was catchy, great job men!
What do you mean bad? That rap was a bop and it looked like it was a lot of fun to make. 10/10
Strong 90's rap vibes. I love it. lol rap gods
As entertainment that song was perfect but as a song, MEh.
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ayo, that Natsuki guy got a SoundCloud?
Why am i watching 3 grown man sitting in a onsen? And why do i enjoy it so much? ... A S O!
Chris Broad on the beat.
The Lyrics are alright for the time limit it got, the cinematography and editing of the video matched that of a professional one. Joey and Natsuki's stupid dance was the best.
So fucking great! The pinnacle of abroad in japan content. “Extra salami!”
Too much volcano, have to say, that was a really impressive rap song in a few hours
Loved it!
Holy fuck the production quality of this. Chris video never disappoint me
i want a vinyl album of that song!
The one who gave them this  challenge  thank you
A.S.O.....its now stuck in my head
That rap slaps :D Great video, I want to stay in that "Hobbit Style" Igloo you showed off.
This is the tgf of japan
Natsuki *Mike drop*   Never laughed so hard until now 🤣
Joey and Natsuki- the new Pet Shop Boys???
if this banger ain't crashing spotify charts i don't know what will
Hardest trappers in the south
To much volcano by abroad in the record deals ft Natsuki and the Animeman sign them a record deal.
This rap has more budget behind it than most of the rap out there.
I love your videos! ❤️ Great rap 👍🏻 The onsen looks awesome. 😍
I rather enjoyed it...😂
More than pleased, You Delivered Truly!
That was actually really good for a days work
When’s the Spotify upload Chris
Hey Natsuki, by any chance, are you descendant of Aso clan  ?. I can't say anything about your rap song ,though. 🙄
Seeing the small app. studio's in Japan I'm honestly amazed that they didn't turn that Aso village in housing yet. Comming from an apartment with cardboard walls and people living to close near each other, to one if those iglo with no directly adjacent neighbours would be superb I imagine.
There's really nothing like watching an Abroad in Japan video after an early breakfast
u should release the rap song on itunes or on a separate youtube video or something, it was lowkey really catchy😂
so when's the itunes release?
Amazing amazing amazing! Your video made my day 🥰
shabbing sounds rather dirty, doesn't it
The song was unironically enjoyable lol
1:01 wait what?! Natsuki have a yt channel? :O
What a banger mate
Imagine if they made a drill song 😂
Grammy feelings!
When will the song be on spotify... I NEED IT NOW
I guess the walls in the hotel are asbestos filled. The reason its deserted is that everbody knows ..
This is peak Abroad in Japan.
when he said: too much volcano...    i felt that
New summertime jam 2021
A S O ? Too much volcano! 🌋
That should have been horrifically cringey but somehow it was fun
I want 'Too much volcano' to play at my funeral
Have my like! (i'm already subbed)
"ASO FARM VILLAGE" -- aka the japanese of wizard of oz with many more buildings/igloos
Absolute GENIUS!!! Superb video. Who needs the usual elements of a rap video (scantily clad models, bling etc) when you have Natsuki, Joey and Chris?!? Just wanted to say your videos are absolutely spot on. I'm half-Japanese, lived, worked and studied in Japan (quite a while ago now though) and I am amazed at how little has changed since I lived there. Keep going with your fantastic content! 👍
I like how Chris and Joey always make a point to show they sleep in separate beds. I bet they have cuddle sessions when the cameras are off :3
Does anybody know the name of the rock song used at the start and end of the episode?
it’s actually good lmaooo
the volcano might explode but more importantly you got a rap song to make. the lengths some people will go to to make good content. respect.
Ngl i liked the rap you made and damn am jelly since i can't travel to japan yet xd
spotify link please?
right another masterpiece has been created.  first is doctor jelly and now a rap team duo?   I wonder what next?   not gonna lie, journey across japan really bring something unique out of it  :>  PS: the intro of the mv really dope
amazing video i absolutely love watching!
Natsuki in a VERY cheap hotel: 'Rats go!'
So that's A.S.O well and truly playing in my head for the rest of the day 🎵🎶👍
Natsuki ftw.
Thanks Chris, Coming back from Work and watching this Video with a huge smile, you made my day!
Here's your own apartment! 'happy Natsuki noises'
My new ringtone, my dudes! :D
Great video Chris and too much volcano had me smiling throughout. I'm excited for the next episode! (Jealous of the private springs)
Right, now put that rap into every intro hereafter.
We  need a video what only has the rap song so we can put that on a music playlist, please=)
For fuck saké gents! Solid series so far as always. With a tight new jam. Double plus good!
The rap was amazing!!-
黒川温泉を選んだのは良いチョイスやな
Elon Musk would buy it.
This is probably the most fun video I saw on this channel so far. Amazing work guys!
Why isn't the music video a separate video? I want to send it to people with no context lol
Best rap song I've ever heard!
The guy who submitted that challenge had no idea what he had just imagined into reality.
23:09 Two grown men chilling in the bathtub and rapping "EXTRA SALAMI". Nothing can beat this.
Still don't understand why journey across Japan isn't in the video title or thumbnail
Natsuki: Go fxxk yourself!
時々日本語喋るナツキが何故かカタコトなの草。お前ネイティブやろ！
To the 128 ( as of writing this, and to future dislike idiots) I hope you stub your toe. Great job on the series looking forward to the next one.
Natsuki should popularize the Tabacottage Core aesthetic✨🚬✨
Amazing that rap was 😂😂👍
The rap had me dancing
They put subtitles for mr. Aso's english. Or should I engrishu
14 hours later i keep singing the chorus. very catchy indeed
The boulder... Monkey??  "Born from an egg on a mountain top!"
Never mind the Fresh Prince of Bel Air, we've got the Adequate Danshaku of Kumamoto!
I love how Joey immediately climbs into every tub in sight
中伊豆にも似たようなのあるな。
The song was actually amazing xD Thanks for the video really push to concider going there in vacation :D
the rap was good!
blimey the first rap song i actually like, usually its rap with a silent C lol
What's up with Natsuki's "Wheeze" hoodie??!! Is he celebrating World Asthma Day??!!
The rap song is actually much nicer that I had expected. Catchy tune and lyrics. Good work.  ;-)
Honestly, want this song on spotify.
Nice touch at the end JAJ...2021
Subtitle natsuki when he speaks english is an injustice! I definitely knew he said "car this way" and not "cart this way".
Well one thing's for sure about your debut as rap artists....No one is going to argue the song is in need of more cowbell.
Damn good rap song 😁
Natsuki is the best! :D :D :D
Amazon Prime have the trio of Clarkson, Hammond and May for the Grand Tour which is a great show. And i think you guys, The Nippon Trio of Chris, Joey and Natsuki are their spiritual successors. Haha. Keep it up guys. Cant wait for the next JAJ episode. ☺️
Honestly we need that song on spotify. Love it
Can we please get a separate upload or a official version of the rapvideo? i would jam this song all day :D
The video was awesome! Lovin’ this JAJ!
Nice haircut, homie. I like it!
Bloody brilliant
Those houses kinda look like the houses you see in dragonball.
Too Much Volcano needs an award. That was top notch
Three words...     TOO MUCH VOLCANO.
song's pretty fire.
That Rap was Amazing! Made me smile.
8:57 Real eagle detected? :p
Chris this video and this series really made me happy. keep up the good work man
nice rap song
That was great in the short amount of time !
Hahahaha that rap video was incredible!! Also, I can't believe the original journey across Japan was 3 years ago already!
I want to go Aso Farm! ASO too many volcano 🌋
Welcome to my hometown Kumamoto !
I need the spotify link for Too Much Volcano plz
couldn't stop smiling when I saw the rap song, love your channel.
This was once again an absolutely amazing episode. I'm so pumped to be watching these when they release each week. That Onsen looks amazing!
Natsuki giving Shing02 a run for his money sheesh
Oh. My. God.
Love this so damn much
the rap song had more production quality and thought put in than most rap songs my friends force me to listen to
sick rap hahaha
So good. Too much volcano is good! Catchy and smooth 👍
Congrats to Joey on the lyrics... the rap was actually better than you guys making it sound
OMG the song is very catchy, you guys are really great!! A S O... Too Much Volcano!😂
"EXTRA SALAMI" !! - HA HA.
The rap song is epic
Need to make it available on Spotify!
I propose a rap song at the end of all @ABROAD IN JAPAN videos starting now.
commenting for the algorithm:)
Joey's little dance🤣🤣 I'm no psychic but I see record deals in your future people🤘🤘😎
I mean . . . that could have been way worse. LOL. Not bad at all, especially for doing it in a day.
Natsuki being awesome
Perfect! Great video and the rap song was cherry on top!
I'm envious. When I visited Aso in May 2010, the area was shrouded in thick fog, and access to the volcano was closed due to strong winds.
Wait.. first journey across japan was 3 years ago... oh god where did the time go???
That Rap song was fire!!!
Will you drop it on spotify because I cant wait to A-S-O So Much Volcano on my way to stressful daily routine
Man I loved this rap song, keep making these videos
i love this rap :)
That igloo hotel reminds of Dragon ball because all house's are rounded even Capsule corp HQ is rounded😄🤩😄😁
My favorite episode so far
This is great 🤣
journey across japan is your best work, very entertaining
2:27 HEY HEYYYY! YOU LEFT YOUR VIDEO CAMERA!!!!
That aso villiage looks like some dragonball capsule corp capsule insta homes or some hobbit home. I can't imagine how many times you had to cut due to giggling.
loooooooooooool the rap video was so good
Am I the only one that wants the rap released on Spotify or YouTube as it's own thing???
That is one of the best fucking video EVER. Too much volcano!!!!  Nice work wombats.....
I'm sure I'll be hearing "no volcano, too much volcano" in my dream tonight 😂😂
2:59 A mochi Smurf village!!! Dreams do come true but I'm not living there...so this dream sucks.
I really appreciate the tire spinning sound added when you guys first pulled out of the lot, it made me laugh harder than it probably should have 😂
The rap song was....brave...yeah...brave is the word... XD I love these videos!
Natsuki's English has gotten even better! So awesome!! 😁
Honestly the rap song was not bad. Better than most I would say :)
Netflix and chill ❌ Shabbing and fucking 👌
I feel bad for the camera guy. He should be a part of the conversation on camera and not only off-camera, unless that is what he wants
Why is the rap actually catchy though 😂
The Rap is so bad, it's actually good 🤣
They got some bars tho
https://youtu.be/FUvnJlsz6IQ  986
Gotta love my extra salami
Nice creative rap!  Fun episode thanks
I enjoyed this, thanks
I've watched the rap a second time, and I absolutely loved it even more than the first
Hahah the rap was fun to listen to
hard
*Ayeee 2nd is here hype for 3rd (RAP WAS GOOD Chris sound have been in lol)*
Great video and excelent song! A S O ! So much Volcano ! Saludos desde Argentina !!!
Best rap I’ve ever heard :D
Brillinat! What you manage to put together j=shows some great editing skills!! I just love the across Japan videos!!
im sure theres one person who's remixing the rap
Not gonna lie, I didn't expect to be vibing this much with their Rap song! ASO! The Dr. Jelly and Mr. Hype EP drop on Spotify soon?
song was fire
I love how Joey just becomes American when he needs to Rap
This is so professional that I can't focus 😆👏
With Japan you're never short of scenic views for all sorts of landscape photography. With Natsuki you're never short of views for all sorts of portrait photography. Dream combo.
Words cannot express how happy the journey across Japan music makes me, please never change it.
Honestly, I have legitimately heard a lot worse. It flowed, rhymed and had a decent hook. Joey and Natsuki on vocals worked well. I might have 'A. S. O. Too Much Volcano' rolling around my head for a while.
So incredible this has to be Japans version of Bedrock. Its pretty cool its nice u experienced it with ur bros.  Luv luv ur videos. Keep'm coming ✌🏽 from 🇨🇦
Oh no.. Now this is gonna be stuck in my head for the entire week. What have you done... :D
good stuff.
So, when can I find this rap on Spotify? 🔥
Shagging and shabbing are way too similar
Finally got to watch the episode after a long day of work, great stuff as always So... where can I download the song?
I can't unsee the tokyo ghoul meme scene now
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Volcano: *throws sulfur dioxide cloud* Natsuki: ✋_Nothankyou_
You guys made my day lol love the rap video
Natsuki: good dancing (referring to himself) Chris: debatable
Wow, just casually dropping a professional grade music video as if it's nothing
The chorus is surprisingly catchy! Great work guys, looking forward to the remaining episodes
A S O
The igloo village looks like a religious sect's compound.
Brilliant!
This truely is, the rap song about a volcano I never knew I needed
Wow....
My new dream in life is to get a Tabaccotage, but for weed instead of cigarettes... even if the name doesn't sound as cool!
Why is there a Wilhelm scream? 🤣
Watching Chris start to beatbox, he just became a lot more relatable to me. I've been beatboxing in secret for years on end now and probably nobody knows this but the whole internet now xD
Fuck everyone disliking this video. This was absolutely fucking amazing. Can’t wait for the rest of journey across Japan. Well done bois !!
A S O
Your rap song is better than many professional Polish rappers ;P
The rap song that made eminem cry
Too much Volcano, Holy Shit, Expert lyricists combine to make an incredible masterpiece
Too much volcane honestly slaps
I usually hate rap... But this was really catchy and fun. Thank you so much for that! ❤
If only the people of Pompeii had Natsuki's intelligence, they could've simply told Vesivus "No thank you".
19:48 TTV
"Too Much Danger" Not a bad Rap, great vid dudes.
Ngl probably the best rap number since Big Shaq
ok that rap video was simply amazing lmao i am really impressed with the quality of this thing! :P
I hate that this stupid volcano song will now be stuck in my head for the next week.
And shabbing was born and shall be carried along for those abroad but not in Japan.... Yet :D
imagine seeing that rap video being aired on some japanese music channel XD
Godlike rap vid bro
ah yes, my favorite part, 3 naked men in the onsen
SO MUCH VOLCANO!!!
X'D the rap song is magnificent xD so funny n actually not bad
Extra Salami !
I’ll blame you guys forever for never being able to get the phrase “ASO too much volcano” out of my brain 🥲💔
Absolut gold!
That's peak enjoyment right there with the boys Chris! Love the rap!
That rap... Omg xD fkn killed me hahah
The rap tbh not bad 😂 I do enjoy it
Joey : Every time I see the cloth on the end of the bed, i yeet that shit off! * places jumper on it *
the rap too overpower...
Amazing episode guys 😂 too much volcano though hahaha. Nice work on the rap & mv. Looking forward to next episodd
Awesome music video! Would've been entertaining to see Chris in the video too though
I liked the rap. The videos are as always amazing quality. Better than anything shown on TV.
be it the vid or the rap song or any other challenge ,these guys never disappoint
The level of production in this videos is INSANE!  I need To much Volcano in Spotify
Heya Chriss, been following your videos for a few years now : ) Love the content, thank you very much. Wanted to ask, is the Theme song for Journey Across Japan available anywhere online? Would love to use it as a ringtone : )
Ah yes, house "A" makes sense....  wait this is Japan why are they using latin letters
It's... Beautiful....
This is great guys, loved it! And damn, this song is now stuck in my head😂 ASO! SO MUCH VOLCANO! 😂
When you realize ASO means Art Sword Online....
In this episode they went from the hobbit land straight into mordor, lmao
Can’t wait for the next episode!
Will Too much Volcano be available on Spotify? It's exactly the kind of motivational rap song I need when i'm at the gym hahaha
Great Song, best episode in months
A S O TOO MUCH VOLCANO! No volcano! SO MUCH VOLCANO! Oh my gooooood
Laughed so hard, your editor needs a pay rise xD
Brilliant. 😀😀😀
ASO-TOO MUCH VOLCANO!!  What an absolute banger
SAO
So dangerous to drink alcohol in an onsen.
ESH ESH ESH!!!!!!!
the song is really catchy, but should be louder! Add MORE gain and booom! XD
That was absolutely amazing! 😂😂👍👍
Are you now a Japanese citizen??
Natsuki and Jelly are such an iconic duo
Those are Dragonball houses!!!
Im waiting for the spotify chris!
I have no idea who Natsuki is. I've seen maybe 2 minutes of him on this channel to date. So why do i love him?
Did you make sure you were all 5 feet apart in the hottub?
Too much volcano. I still fancy chris
We getting this on spotify someday? I need to listen to this while in a hot bath
#pleasemaketheepisodeslonger
To little rap, more volcano!
I think your rap was excellent!  Enjoy your journey! Take care!
Considering you had so little time to create said rap I am quite impressed with what you pulled off, it was a lot better than I was expecting.
A...S...O so much volcano, no volcano, no volcano... A...S...O too much volcano
*Camera Pans room* 2 beds sit in room. *Camera pans room later* 3 beds sit in room.
Best.episode.ever 🤣
Seriously you should try putting it on MTV or maybe the Japan equivalent ;) AND i mean the Rap song
Can’t wait for the next song “My Aso is on fire”
Probably should have asked Garnt (Gigguk) to help with the rap am I right?
Amazing work. Music video and all! I am so glad to get to enjoy content like this once again. Thank you for all y'alls time and effort!
Too much volcano 🤩
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Did you pay for their rooms? :O
You are going to be interviewed on TV again, lol
Danger mountain, lava fountain.
How does one submit a challenge?  I would love to ha e seen the looks on theur faces if the challeng was something nice like "complete your days plans with enough time for a hot spring bath and a nice dinner",  I would be interrested to see if they all rushed through the days plans or if they just started shortening the schedule.
i think i had a wide smile throughout Too Much Volcano
find it kinda cool that chris can beatbox cD
I wonder which room Norm slept in in Kurokawa onsen.
oo sheit the song actually turned out pretty decent. joey got some flows
this gave me a huuggee LSS 😵 A.. S.. O... too much Volcano! 🙆‍♀️🤟🤟🤟
Thanks for another banger video from Journey Across Japan😎 "A.S.O too much volcano"🌋💃
I am going to have that rap song stuck in my head all day now.  Are private hotsprings common?  I've been planning a trip to japan forever now, but I can't do bathouses with other people.  One, because I have a tattoo, but also because I am trans and am pre-surgery so wouldn't really be welcomed in either side, male or female without it being super uncomfortable.  But one of the biggest reasons to go to Japan for me is the bath houses and hot springs, so I don't want to miss out too much.  I pray they're as common as your youtube page suggests, but I just don't know.    Anyone have good or bad news there for me?
I will be singing too much volcano all day way to go 💪🏼
Dude, that shot of Joey at the beginning of the rap song...your video production skills are getting darn good. Christopher Nolan might be giving you a call.
Amazing rap song, great editing!
So is that song on Spotify? Asking for a friend..
made my day as always haha
Yo where the Spotify link at
In the video title of the song is "Too much volacano"- have I missed some joke?
Natsuki with that hair and folded yukata arms looks like a Flintstones character 😂
The music video was EXCELLENT
The rap was lit.
That first song on the start of the video was really great xD  But yeah, the Rap is really good! :D MORE OF THESE! :D
Work that drone. I see you kept it well away from the crater. Might've been a bit tricky to fetch from the caldera. The song fitted the day and, let's face it, there are a lot of worse songs out there. Kudos to lyricist Joey.
Yo the Rap was actually sick tho That was fantastic on all fronts!
was already laughing so hard at the rap video but the "EXTRA SALAMI" i lost my shit good stuff guys xD
And now i have this tune stuck in my head 🙈
lol love this, you guys are funny :)
Nice song boi's!! And good video as always ;)
Aight, when is the album coming out?
That was great! Well done
3:37 I think he said smurf village but with a N
It’s so fucking catching A S O too much volcano
We're chilling in the inn Black tatami Shabbing our dinner Extra umami
Natsuki is a Japanese national treasure.
When's the live music tour?
A S O  ~ too much volcano~ dude its freaking smooth lol
Rap song for the win!!!
Amazing
I don't know why but the rap song reminds me of the theme song for The Fresh Prince of Bel Air...
Chris: "...weird dystopian future where people live in huts." *The World Economic Forum has entered the chat*
Just keeps getting better and better
Joey should also be called the AnimeRapster... Just saying....
Chris, release Too Much Volcano on Spotify NOW
Poor Natsuki🥺
Doesn't the igloo houses look like the Capsule houses from Dragon Ball?
This made my year. Loved it and would listen to if you ever do a MP3 😁
That A.S.O. hook is so damn good!
That's pretty impressive for 9 hours and no warning! Also, this brings back awesome memories of our trip to Kyushu and Aso. We didn't stay in an igloo, but we liked the animals and onsen, and there's some good produce in the shop. Though the onsen wasn't as impressive as your private hotel rooms, that looked AMAZING!
There's both too much and no volcano
*runs to spotify and stares in horror that the banger of 2021 isn't there!
The rap was fire 🔥🔥
ASO, Too much Volcano 🌋. It's catchy as hell.
You bloody legends! That was fantastic and worth the watch! Keep up the great work guys!!!
"Too much volcano" & "cycle bicycle" have quickly become some of my favourite "play in the car for friends to see if they notice" songs. And yes they loved "cycle bicycle" so I think this one is a no brainer.
A S O so much volcano  A S O awesome video!
That chorus is volcanic fire.
Village has been pillaged by barbarians, that’s why it’s empty. I propose more archer towers
Daaammmnn too much volcano is lit! We are waiting for the epic release on spotify, apple music, youtube music and all the platforms in the world. This was so amazing and fun haha
That was art.
This song hits without warning)) Best part of the video certainly)
Ive rewatched the ASO RAP 10 times now and it's so epic! You guys are super talented. So grateful you invest so much effort in your content!
Is this on Spotify?
That rap was o for awesome!!
It’s like a Centre Parks from Hell
A S O, too much volcano
A S O    To much volcano!!!
The rap was better than I thought it would be. 😂 I was prepared for maximum cringe but it was fun! 😄
Love love loved "Too Much Volcano"... CHALLENGE COMPLETED!
Nobody: Natsuki's hoodie: *WHEEZE*
That sound slaps, you did a great job. Definitely nailed it!
Natsuki should put this song to his barber shop!
Abroad in japan tv series.. broadcasted in every onsen all over japan
I think ASO has found its new tourist video! Love it 🥰
FAVOURITE RAP EVER YUP DA LADZ
Which ryokan in Kurokawa was that?
the rap is so cute 😂
The Igloo village kinda reminds me of the DBZ Capsul corp houses.  *Wrote this before hearing about them*
Great rap guys, it was fun to watch, and better than expected, great video!!!
DANGER VOLCANOO
My favourite rap period
The production is off the chain.
Can I have a recc for the app controlled lights!
Best rap I’ve ever heard! Appreciating all the effort you did for this video guys. 😂❤️🤘
Joey and his beloved bath tubs
Natsuki is such an aso
I loved the rap, Natsuki's beats are lit!
Hey, if you're able to make a great flow with pockets that'll knock anyone out listening to it casually, you're already one to three steps ahead in the rap game.
That song is catchy as hell and an impressive video for 9h of shooting. Loved the episode  and keep up the great work.
Almost choked on my lunch to the rap song. Natsuki is a treasure to us all.
A.S.o :D
Haha this was mint! Now it’s stuck in my head lol but surely that’s a good sign if a song sticks right?
9 hours? No joke its better than some that takes weeks to shoot. But also I'm DYING at Joeys moves in the music video. His stoic face with the stiff moves. epic. -Lyrics were on point though, but i expected that since i heard joeys stuff before.
This made my week. :,)
Ok, i need "so much volcano" on spotify asap please Chris, make it happen.
Insanely good
The Aso Villages houses remind me of those dome houses in Dragon Ball.
You know I think 🤔 I would download and actually listen to the song  traveling to work. That's how brilliant of song it was.
Natsuki is like if ur grandpa was young
always improving the videos, you dont have to be so perfect. thank god that this channel exists, love your content
Alright, its 30°c here, seeing the volcano made it feel like it's 50.. Or could it be you.
Chris was hiding in the Volcano  during the RAP
A  S  O
The rap song actually slaps, you should release it on youtube!
i don't think anyone really requested a rap video i think they just wanted to make one lol
Natsuki and rap it’s gonna be a great episode
That rap is everything
Please put up the rap video on its own!
The music video is both the best and worst thing I've seen in quite some time.
A👏 S👏 O👏   SO MUCH VOLCANO 👏👏
Great job, guys! You had me bopping in my chair to 'Too Much Volcano'. It's a happy, snappy song, with happy snappy people!
Natsuki fucking killed his part. Nice job on the music video boys! That hotspring looked so good.
Nice video Chris, Happy Adventure 👍
So where's the soundcloud link?
That rap was a absolute banger!
Natsuki's a bloody legend mate.
The rap song was really good 👍
The music video ACTUALLY SLAPS
This video is amazing! The rap was golden too! The cinematography was fantastic, all around amazing!
I think this is a pretty catchy song. Looking forward to the fucking place next week.
The Rap was amazing!
Soo dope 👌👌
That rap is stuck in my head now.  Loved all of this!!!
🤨.........🤣
Honestly that was so well put together, for a group of mates randomly making a rap video while enjoying themselves on holiday that's top tier shit.
thank you for the catchy record. a... s... o...
Soooo Bad!!!... But so Good!
Thank god this came out when it came out. Today I had an exam, and I ended up getting an absolute terrible grade, and it really ruined me. But watching this video really helped me cheer up again. So thank you very much, for making such wonderful videos. <3
I love how Joey looks like a budget Joji or Pinkguy. Well done loved this film chris!
I'm guessing the houses from Dragon Ball are inspired from these igloo houses?
Does anyone know the actual name of the ryokan/inn they stayed at? Kurakawa Onsen is the area, which have multiple ryokans and unless if I've skipped over it somehow, I can't seem to find them actually talking about the name of the specific ryokan they stayed at.
awesome video!! is it available in spotify
the rap was the most wholsome cringe ive had in my life hahahaha love it
You guys are fucking phenomenal!!
Wilhelm Scream .... Perfect.
Excellent rap song ! And I like shabbing :D
I'm curious if the person from the previous journey across Japan wrote the challenge "Kiss Joey" or just "Bread" for this one and it's just floating around trying to be noticed :D Awesome video and stunning sights! Can't wait for more!
One challenge should be to go and find Natsuki pants :D
OMG THAT MUSIC VIDEO WAS AMAZING LOL
Hahahahahahahahaha
It is is funny.  Every time there is a bath tub and Joey is around, he has to climb in.  The rap song was actually pretty good.  Good job.
Great video! The rap turned out a lot better than I was expecting. The onsen looks fantastic. Definitely will be on the list for when borders reopen.
After a really rough couple days, I was so excited to see this video. It felt like taking a break to spend time with good friends.  I was instantly cheered up and laughed for the first time in awhile. Thank you so much for all your hard work, just to allow us to escape with you for a brief time, for me it's become a lifeline some days.  Y'all are greatly appreciated.
The Rap was bomb! I like! The music video was magnifique as well!
The rap was legit so good. It's so goddamn catchy! XD
I’m so glad that this is what our Patreon subs are funding.   10/10 content
Natsuki is a don. big up.
WHERE CAN I DOWNLOAD TOO MUCH VOLCANO?!
"There is a degree of risk, but we've got a rap song to make" this is why I'm subscribed.
How did you get the drone shots while driving?
i seriously thought i heard them say shagging when they actually said shabbing xD
Chris brings the music Joey brings the lyrics  Natsuki brings the SWAG
Loved the sneaky wilhelm scream in the song
The first 30 seconds of introduction/teasers was great and got me instantly hooked. Whoever edited that deserves a medal.
Yes! Go on Natsuki! What a banger
Cant stop laughing great JOB guys!!
A S O too much volcano I really like it.
This is the end of Kanye....
joey tries too hard
Natsuki Rap 🔥
TheRapMan
This song is shockingly good! :D
We demand the rap be released on Spotify
try harder with the haircut..
That's a pretty cool volcano.
The song was actually surprisingly impressing for something made in 9hrs. Imagine if they had a week or something...
that actually was a pretty nice song, well done guys 🙌🏼
Joey rapping reminds me of cringy white rapper from the 90's😂😂 its so bad its good
We need another DR Jelly commercial
Shit is kinda fire ngl! "You have just been defeated, i dare say thats challenge completed". My favourite JAJ episode of all of them so far.
I love the bilingual dialogue, language barriers are an illusion 😆
I will now be singing this song all day.
Favorite. Video. Ever.
Im honestly postivly surprised by the rap. I expected funny garbage, but got fun music.
That song was legitimately excellent. Stick it on Spotify!
I feel like Joey doesn't like Natsuki
Quite brilliant. :)
That was the best rap I have ever heard althought I suppose were I live in the UK the music is so crap I no longer listen to music
honestly pretty good
epic music
Love the song, good job guys XD
I could not believe my ears! Great effort beautifully filmed. It´s the song of this summer.
You should do a song after every episode 😂
Cool video !! Thanks Dave ;-) The rap video was really good mate !!
OMG that made my Day!  :D
The hotel looks incredible!!!
oh shit I accidentally disliked the video thinking I was disliking ad
ngl the rap song SLAPS
"I like Pizza"
this is like waiting for new episodes of your favourite tv show
Wait...Chris can BeAtBoX???!!! 😳😳🥰
Too much volcano, not enough Chris.
Another good episode. The rap was surprisingly good considering the time scale in which you managed to put it together.
To be honest this rap sounds better  than 90% of todays rap songs
You know a rap is well done when someone else hearing the video from another room thinks its made by a famous wrapper XD
I'd legit listen an EP produced by you guys. Just make sure the lyrics are at least this nonsensical.
You know a wrap is well done when someone else hearing the video from another room thinks its made by a famous wrapper XD
Good fun as always. And more places I need to visit next time I am back in Japan - hopefully in 2022
Thanks for this, much needed happy vibes on a Monday. Well done lads.
Im loving this!
The song is actually pretty catchy 🤪🤟
Joey was rapping ? Dr. Lil Jelly?!! missed opportunity    love you guys<3
Aso too much valcano
Surprisingly decent.  Thought it would be more of a horrible lonely island parady
Awesome rap song but where was Chris?
Brilliant!
Did anyone else expect some murderous Teletubbies to appear in the Aso Farm Village? Loved the rap song as well! 😁🤙👍
That was a pretty good rap considering you did it in a day.
this is it boys  superb quality content right here💯
This was a really fun episode and challange, well done! Greetings from Brazil!
The Beasty Boys are back, I love it :D Drop the Spotify link already!!!
I want "Too much volcano" on spotify
19:21 My life's folding out great, like a perfect origami.
Eminem's been real quiet since JAJ dropped this video🤔
The Hell are you talkin' about, Chris!!! Too Much Volcano slaps!!! Given the time... Good job, Lads!!!
I just realized, that rap really sounded like a lonely island song.
We need this rap on spotify! 😂
Amazing
i see 'platinum' in your future.
Exactly right amount of volcano
That rap song is actually pretty good for the time it took them to make it. Shots are professionally filmed as well, good job Chris. I was kinda hoping for Chris to join the boys as well.
20:00 As a japanese, Joey's reaction is 100% japanese😂
The next Gangnam style
the rap song was actually good
18:25 -You're like a Meeboo. -Meeboo?
AHH SHIT HE SPITTIN!!!!
that song surprisingly slapped.
Japanese Mordor I like
Those drone shots of the guys dancing/singing at the volcano LOOK AMAZING. The whole music video is an absolute jam!
Drake got some serious competition
This is the type of rap song that will stay in your subconscious mind for years, so there will come a day when we'll be scratching our heads over this song!! XD  WELL DONE YOU ALL!!
That rap was amazing. It was super catchy and the bars were fire!
Joey is like Joji without the edge, it was still better than expected.
That rap was WAY too good! Holy crap. That was incredible!
TOO MUCH VOLCANO
Omg this is actually my fav video of yours so far!
That song was effin lit!! So nice .. good song
What was the app for music. So useful
A cheap hotel he said, when that looks way better than my actual house, first world complaints I guess, rich bastards.
Brilliant rap guys considering you only had 9 hours!! Looking forward to the next episode!
for only 9 hours,... it´s awesome,..... takes me back to the 90s =)
Wow!! This is seriously good!! I can’t help laughing as I watch this - A-S-O too much volcano. Great chemistry there among the 3 of you and great places visited! Keep going! Seriously good.
For all of the bros that want to vibe here is the time stamp 21:24 😎
I HAVE TO KNOW. What's the app that you used at 18:47?
This is what youtube was ment for imo
Not bad
If Too Much Volcano doesn't end up on Spotify top 100 worldwide imma rage
Fuxking god. I love the intro
Suicide, that song's actually so catchy 😆
When are you guys going on tour?
to be honest, for doing it in 9 hours is quite good.
AYO THAT BANGS
So when will Too much volcano be available in Spotify?
The Wilhelm Scream just was the cherry on top of an amazing rap.
you guys killed it <3<3<3
A  S  O
Dave, I gotta say, this more than makes up for not really getting the last challenge
My man Natsuki have a good future as a rapper
awesome
Why is the hook of No More Volcano so catchy ?!
I live for that intro.
When is it on Spotify????
So enjoyed the rap and the doc! 👍🏼👍🏼
Tell me why I've been rapping for 10 years and natsuki bodies my whole career with 10 words tho...
6:04 Natsuki Buntarou 🔥🔥
That was a freaking bop good job bois
But where was Chris in the music video?
so.... A S O!
Brilliant.My eyes are watering due to my laughter.
Those houses look like the capsule houses from Dragonball
105 people didn’t get enough volcano! Awesome work guys, can’t wait for the next episode!
I hate Rap! But you guys, hit it out of the park!!! It be in the music charts. Before you know it!
Chris is so good at making beats he could do professional rap, I was very surprised, VERY NICE!
I liked the rap
I mean, it’s perfectly normal to not see anyone in that village. Gnomes are shy creatures.
The song and video are really well produced! And I loved the Wilhelm Scream near the end!
They be rappin better than those lame ass tokyo rappers! Shout out to natsuki ayy
The Wilhelm scream  ended me!
Gotta make it make ringtone
That rap was really quite catchy loving this series 🤗
I'd call it a Grotto
Brilliant MV. Kudos to Joey for the excellent lyrics.
spotify?
Aso It's a good place, isn't it? It's my hometown. There is nothing, but I love the nature of Aso.I was surprised to find the same hometown as Natsuki-san! Is Natsuki's name Aso? If so, it could be a name related to Aso Shrine⛩
funny rap song, good job.
Honestly, such a gift of a series, this one. Also can't wait for the next Dr.Jelly XD
This village reminds me more of dragon ball than of flintstones 😄
Petition to get the song on Spotify/Apple music because I definitely need to be able to listen to that at work or in the car
When will "Too much volcano" be available on Streaming Platforms?
Yooooo this song is such a jam, you could spread it on toast!
This is some of the most gangsta shit I've ever seen and I love it. Eminem eat your heart out.
Not gonna lie, that rap was lit
please upload the rap only, i want to listening it all day long :D
Jokes aside, that music video was actually pretty decent.
The beds in the onsen looked like they were made out of clouds
My dad and was rocking out to too much volcano without any context whatsoever
That rap music video was 90s MTV quality, it was so good.
THAT RAP IS SO GOOD THOUGH  I have a new destination in my travel wish list: Kurokawa Onsen. God that place looks heavenly.
Bruh that was fire lmao
You dudes need to make more music but with more serious lyrics haha
I love the rap sounds really good u all worked so hard on it xxxxxxx
Natsuki doing adlibs is honestly perfect
Chris did you hire someone to mix the song? Or are you a mixing genius too?
Good work fellas, make me smile on a Monday morning.
What's the name of the app?
individual videoclip please
Lads on tour
That rap song made me laugh so much that was ace good job lads.
Great job!
This show is already iconic 🔥
Chris, u may not read this but i genuinely love your channel. hope i can travel Japan too!
Natsuki really sounded like Captain Falcon in the song lol
the rap music was fun!
Amazing song guys keep it up.
The song has a super old school Grandmaster Flash beat.
I loved that song so much! And video made me laugh so hard. Amazing job boys!
TOO much VOLCANO! no volcano! badabeem badaboom!
You guys are hallarious ! I dont like rap but that was awsome x
Epic rap song.
shabbing with the boys by the river side sounds awfully close to; shagging with the boys by the river side.
There was nothing about this I didn't love. In a world that's frequently absolute bobbins you guys are a consistent source of happiness. Thank you all!
u guys should have that rap part as a separate video/music mv
So proud of you three, for that rap! LOoking forward to the next vid guys! AWESOME!
Cool uzumaki sweater Joey. I have a Tomie hoodie 👌
The rap was great ha. I need it as a ringtone.
absolutely impeccable.
Now that is the sort of rap I can listen to on repeat!
Abroad in Japan is best <3
hope to see " too much volcano " trend the spotify lists world wide!
Joseph the animation man once again turns x100 more japanese when he makes contact with hot water.
OMG! Thats F... Epic! You need to do  more song challenges, seriously you guys are amazing!
It was good
Too much volcano is definitely going in my mix
I'm afraid that your rap far exceeds any of my preconceived expectations. By being good, on this occasion; you're standards are slipping. Please cease from producing acceptable content, and revert to the usual standard.
Igloo village sounds good for some peace and quiet. Curtains could be thicker. Thats a pretty good rap!
Chris, my wife is from Aso, born and raised. We watched this video together and she's been walking around the house nonstop saying, "A-S-O, soo much volcano"   Also, I used to be a manager at Aso Farm Village. It's a terrible "black company" and they cant keep a manager for more than 2 months. I was there for 6 months and had 3 different bosses start during my stint there lol.
This is absolute gold, Chris! The rap song is stuck in my head and I am adding Aso to my list of places to visit next time we are in Japan! Excellent quality once again, your videos can genuinely rival any Amazon or Neflix travel documentary out there!! Well done
I'm gonna pull up in da hood headbanging to that piece
The production value of these videos are insane
I thought when you said the song was bad you were being serious lmao that was straight LAVA 💥💥
A S O SO MUCH VOLCANO
When I saw the preview last week (with the igloo houses), I was questioning my sanity a little given the intensity of the deja vu. Turns out, he really *did* go there in a previous Journey Across Japan. I'm not crazy after all haha
the rap is too epic :D :D
Please don't rap again
Already completed the challenge in the first 2 minutes of the video, what a pro
A  S  O ... too much vulcano ... this will be in my head for the rest of the day :-D it's so great to have another journey across japan, you guys are the best! :-DDD
Why does the rap remind me of 'Flight of the Conchords'?
So much volcano is the new pineapple pen
The music video is soo good :D
Looked like fun. Well done.
Best rap song ever guys well done! 👍🏽
Just 🤣🤣🤣🤣
This show always puts a smile on my face and i really needed it today. Stay awesome guys
Spotify/Itunes/Soundcloud when for Too Much Volcano!?
THE RAP 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😁😍😍😍😍😍
Wow congrats on the song..  It was fun and catchy 👍🎶
Very good song lmao, even tho i wanted Chris to have a part in it lol
Road to Japan Rap Billboard charts 🔥🔥🔥🔥🇳🇿🇵🇭
It was an ok rap song, not enough volcano though.
LOL... The rap was not too bad. 👏👍😄 Why was Chris not in the video? 😄
Thank you, Chris. Now that fucking song is stuck in my head..............  jokes aside, awesome production and content. Though you've said that you might not do another series like this for a while, deep down inside I hope you would do more of this. Maybe mini road trips of 2-3 days so it's easier to plan...
Two dudes in a tub saying "EXTRA SALAMI" XD
something nice, about this rap hmm.. i will skip this one.
Wait hold up, this song is kinda fire
The houses look like the ones in Dragon Ball
Ngl, i Kinda want to adopt Natsuki
honestly the Aso Farms Estates have so much potential to be awesome but its like they use all their budget on the building and nothing on the inside design.
I dunno if I am happy or sad they didn't notice Tatami rhymes with mommy.  Woulda been weird lyrics to be sure
So many people are bombarding the Kurokawa onsen site, the site is having a seizure. T^T
Catchy tune :) You guys are nutters. I love you all!
The rap song was so good and so bad at the same time, I love it
A S O!
🤣😇👍👍 Love it 🤣🤣😎👍❤️❌🌈🌈 Fabulous guys . 🤣🤣
Thisis soo good. great video and good job on the rap song/video. Great trio of Chris, Natsuki and Joey
This is the best rap song about igloos, onsens and volcanos i’ve ever heard
Last time I was in Aso, I drove to Aso Farm Village and mostly saw the MASSIVE parking lot pretty empty around shop closing time (3 or 4pm). But I did see a lot of presumably day-trippers doing sports activities in one of their many facilities. There were about 10 or 20 so odd people at the gift/souvenir area too. It's honestly a strange place. TBF, the entirety of this whole area is pretty otherworldly.
And once again, no Abroad in Japan journey is complete without a shot of Joey in a bathtub.
The only rap song i know and the only one i'll listen to, gj its phenomenal how people who have nothing to do with music industry come up with better stuff than milionare artists  who do music from the womb
E X T R A   S A L A M I
I swear if you guys don`t get any Award for your video`s soon, i`m going to be really mad. So much love are going into the video`s! Long lives the Brotherhood of Chaos <3 <3 <3
This challenge was not passed. It got fridgeing DESTROIED! :D
or the shire...and omg welcome to Japan sh1ttest boy band
Thats just too much volcano 😂🔥
Thanks for this amazing video!
Wow
Lol the rap song is so good XD
Eminem has been silent ever since this rap song dropped!
No spider trash this time? ;) Great episode :D Yo guys should start a tour company, in preparations for when things open up again. The CJN Japan Tours.
not gonna lie, the rap is catchy. and the trip looked awesome.
Amazing dance moves.
Less than a minute in the video: "A.. S.. O... So much volcano" - I already died laughing.
Wilhelm Sceam 22:56
Oh god, that song was awesome! Had a lot of fun!
That was bloody brilliant!
i don't like rap but hey im grinning throughout the song
The production values for a rap in 9 hours were surprisingly high.
I was crying laughing throughout the whole music video, but when Natsuki said extra salami I completely lost it 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Out on apple music when?
Pulling a music video together in a day with limited resources is a major task. Good work from the whole team. Too much volcano is ace. Really like the professional work in all these videos. 420p - go fuck yourself:)
I need this rap in a chill/rap beats to study to
I have to say the Music video would be sick if the Volcano actually errupted at the end. Another great video guys nice!
Please reupload ToMuchVolcano as its own VOD on your channel seperately!
Actually Akira Toriyama used this igloo village as inspiration.
His family originates from Aso? Natsuki was forged in the fires of Mt. Doom, gotcha.
Should have added a Dr. Jelly cameo in the rap video, but otherwise, awesome video!
i think legit chris's challenges can just be albumed and sold as a compilation product
That beatboxing skills......
Hey Chris, could you maybe start placing links to the places you're staying? I would love to stay at that Onsen cave!
This just reminds me of dragon ball capsule houses
Ah my favorite rap channel showing off their next high school presentation.
Now how do I download this new "Too Much Volcano" on Spotify? Love it so much
Now I'll have to explain whenever someone hears me sing Too Much Volcano!
The scenery is incredible. i definitely would go there if i had the chance
The hotel kinda looks like Teletubbies home lol
Can't believe they filmed themselves shabbing with each other!
here feck the volcano how come no one mentioned Chris can beatbox so casual and nonchalantly 😂
what is the use of the wooden hammer in bathrooms?
Abroad in Japan album when?
BEST EP. EVER! Sugoi!
hahaha, the start of the rap song, gave me some, danny phantom vibes.
The igloo homes remind me of CapsulCorp from Dragonball
Natsuki is such a gem
watching these episodes just gives me so much life i love this series too much
I had to do many many improv songs and theater plays for several holiday trips with groups. I won't lie: This song slaps, it really does.
Incredible production quality as always!
I've just been to the same places a month ago. Aso really looks like something from a different world and I remember looking at the exact same rock thinking it looks like a dragon egg from TGoT. Hope you enjoyed your trip!
Too much volcano!!!!! Need it on Spotify ❤️❤️
This was the greatest way to reveal that Chris can beatbox
Joey & Natsuki are Grandmaster Flash!!!
Joey be spitting straight wasabi tho
The igloo village reminds me of Phantasy Star IV, for Mega Drive: a sci-fi but fantasy like place at the same time!
ASO
You managed to do a rap song with a nice sound and veeery nice visuals in a day, I wonder if you would put effort into making it for more time how would it become. Nice work!
New Boy Band! 🔥🤟✨
Hello Mr Abroad :p thank you for your amazing videos they never stop to make my day a bit better each time I watch them. I have watched all of your videos and I must say I love them and I respect the amount of effort put into each one of em it truly shows how much you love doing them . I love the music you use on your videos especially on Journey Across Japan its amazing . Thank you for taking your time to do all theese entertaining videos I truly appreciate your effort . Thank you from  a Finnish guy living in Sweden.
Cool rap
Excellent
When I see the notification for your video, I intentionally put off watching it until I am ready to savour the dry sarcastic Brit humour. Another great video Mr. Broad
This is has to become a regular series!!!!
That was a wonderful piece of music guys.
Epic rap my guys!!!
Huh the rap was really good 👍 I like
Am I just imagining it or is Chris's video quality increasing with each upload..
Think I am gonna visit Japan once the pandemic is over with. Beautiful country and culture. Well done Chris and the gang to demonstrate it’s beauty.
Why does Joey's dance give me Jojo vibes? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
A S O TOO MUCH VOLCANO 🌋 So catchy!!
Chris, you were born in the wrong decade - even your hip hop tunes sound 80s! Great vid as usual. Cheers from Ireland.
The rap was better than all Jake Paul songs combined.
So Goku's house is real?
I love the Wilhelm scream
Chris should quit being a youtuber and start producing music videos
Damn that song was actually surprisingly well made and of course the rest of that video was good aswell but esp. the rap song
Thanks, now I've got Too Much Volcano stuck in my head
Shab on dem haters!
God damn this is iconic
In this episode, Chris Broad in Morrowind
Too much volcano reminds me a mix of 2Pacs song changes and Will Smith’s fresh prince of bel air
Oooooooh, CATCHY
Not sure which was more surreal - the Mars-like place, or the rap
The rap was hella dope actually 👌
listen up new hot summer hit "too much volcano"
This makes me feel like putting my shoes and running outside the house and having a little adventure or two… well done. And that rap video was fab.
14:42 Natsuki having ptsd
I love this Journey Across Japan series. Natsuki's smile when he explored his room in the inn was so sweet.   The rap video is da bomb! lol. It's really good. I was smiling from start to finish.
Um wth that rap song was amazing
The rap was actually so good!! 😂😂😂 It's commendable that you were able to produce it in such a short time!!
Whoa, Clarkson, May, and Hammond have undergone quite a transformation to give us such a Jolly good trip around Japan. Bloody amazing!
I sometimes forget that Joey lives a normal human life
Natsuki is a national treasure and needs to be protected.
Loved the rap boys, there's not been much to raise the spirits this last year but that definitely made me smile!!
I know they were just messing around, but Too much Volcano was really pretty decent! I'd love to see what they could come up with not under a nine hour time limit, or even without a video component
it was funny, and interesthing
This second "Journey" is exactly how the most perfect holiday with the bros should look like.
This needs wayyyyyyyy more views, this is incredible.
Yo Chris, those were some sick skills hahaha
the quality of your vids, is incredible :D and I can understand your english without problems ( I'm from italy)
Is it me or is it that Chris is being extra snarky and a tad bit shady towards   Natsuki🤔? The vibe is off here. That dangerous push at the waterfall...😑😐 The rap was good.
I was not prepared at how good that rap actually turned out. Nice job!
You could release the next episodes as a premiere so ppl can chat while watching it
fricken brilliant....so much volcano
👏👏 Nicee
This does put a smile on my face
Why is Chris not in the music video?
Birth of a masterpiece
For such a short amount of time, you guys did a pretty good rap video! Looking forward to the next episode of The Lost Islands!
Honestly, you made it sound like it was going to be horrible but that was an amazing rap song for something produced in 9 hours. I don't even like rap and you caught me with the catchy tune and lyrics... I will admit I started laughing at Joey's face the second it started though heh...
DJ Broad, Dr Jelly and NAT ASS - guys you are awesome! Waiting for this to be on Spotify!
S H A B  B I N G !! (^_^)
I need a video of the standalone rap😅😅
im surprised at how good the RAP MV is. omg lOL
chris giving competion to joji
Natsuki please title your next album "Car This Way"
That rap is actually very good! I’m not a rap fan, but I enjoyed it.
The rap was epic guys.
This song is surprisingly good, well done guys! :)
So.. when is ASO so much volcano song releasing in spotify?
VOLCANO PRE PRIME LITE KITE
Spotify!! when?
Production quality is still higher than most of the mainstream hip-hop 😂
so when can we get a download of the rap video :D i feel like this needs to be blasting out my car mid summer with the windows down :D
These keep getting more questionable by the day, but i'm not complaining
WHOS HOLDING THE CAMERA!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?
Well this is the only rap song I've ever liked so congrats lol.
Where's the Spotify link? 😂
I wonder if there is a connection between the Aso farmhouses and Goku's house design in Dragon Ball Z?
Well thanks for the earworm. Too much volcano.
Now that's a pro rap.... amazing work lmao
No Kumamon? Omg
Oh come on i barely survived this! Couldn't catch my breath, i need this on Spotify asap! New Podcastintro?
A-S-O So much Volacno
Who needs Netflix when there is Abroad in Japan
MODERN STYLES DYNAMIC LITE KITE PING TOP ONSENN ;PRE PREMIER
A S O Too much VOLACANO!
Amazing episode and an Amazing RAP
What artist and song is that starting at 9:50?
You ask to say something nice. Nice😎
LOVE ALL THESE VIDEOS
Loved the rap video, gave me a good laugh. Can't believe you guys put so much effort in these challenges, thanks for the hard work!
This is one of the only places where I can learn something but be very entertained at the same timec
can you release this as a standalone song on youtube music
superb
Volcanoed it Team 🎉🥂
Not gonna lie... that song was fire....
Gunna have the rap song on repeat all week. Sooo good. ASO too much volcano! :D
Love the rap!! EXCELLENT job guys!!
Chris got the pay = ASO.. So much volcano, no volcano
Naisu
Absolutely hilarious lads one of the best things on YouTube
Natsuki is a Japanese national treasure.   We need to steal him and bring him  back to the states.
The rap was actually really good, it gave me a good chuckle!
everybody: japan is so crowded, people have to live in a shoebox. japan: ghost villages.
Yes. I cannot wait for the next episode. I do not listen to rap, but this, this was good. Good job guys, good job.
Never knew thats how its like to stay inside Gokus and Chichis home.
Release the Album!! JAJ - So Much Volcano ft. Natsuki & Joey
Another brilliant video. Keep it up Chris
I can imagine the smell at the volcano. When I was in the University, we were brought one day at the receiver pit of sewage treatment plant, the place to where all sewage from the city of 650,000 is coming in. All girls except for one refused to go to the brim while the guy showing us around only commented "yeah, it's a bit smelly". Concentration of poisonous sulfuric gases was certainly exceeding any safety limits.
this episode had a lot of style 10/10
TFW there's so much volcano that there's no volcano. Everything, and yet nothing, is volcano. Maybe deep.
FERRY FUKUSHIMA LITE KITE PRE PREMIER
P-L-A-Y On repeat and loop this video to infinity and in perpetuity forever in our heart fans!
Wow I loved this episode!!!!!! Keep the great work boys can’t wait for the next one! Love from Australia
How beautiful
The igloo house thing. Look to me like a holiday resort to me.
The rap was fun
What a video! This made my day. I had huge smile watching this adventure of a sarcastic Brit, a Karen Aussie and an atypical Japanese man one their adventures across Japan!
Sounds like “ too much cocaine you know “
Great series! what's the app Chris is using @ 18:50?
Ngl that music video was the best, I mean the song was cheesy but daymn the videography was fire
That rap song makes me smile so much! I love you guys so much
Joey: is this safe?
ASO
I want a too much volcano concert please
When this rap video is legit better than actual professionally produced ones 🌚😂
Too much volcano!
I was astonished by the visuals of the rap, and for just having 9 hours it looked and sounded unexpectedly awesome!
🤣👍
Loved this episode.... is no volcano available on iTunes?
The rap song was so bad that I loved it 😂 When does the rest of the album drop?
When does the rap come to Spotify?
Please go on Britain’s Got Talent and perform this
Chris you NEED to release the video separetly!! Its so good 🔥
The boys look so cute and innocent dancing in the igloo village and then it cuts to them being badass in front of a volcano and chilling in the onsen like yakuza.
Rets go!
Well that was enjoyable! Have to say I really appreciated the Wilhelm scream in the music video
Wow .. amazing .. I still can't get over it❤️
Yoo the music video turned out super good!! Wasnt expecting it to be so cinematic. Cant wait for the next episode
A.S.O. great. Thanks again for a brilliantly funny, entertaining episode.
Amazing rap, not enough Chris, just the right amount of Natsuki.
Music at 5:20 sounds like something from Doc Martin haha
Chris: I've only seen you do exercise once, Natsuki Me: *zuiikin eigo girls flashbacks*
I actually like the song....
The rap is too good... I can't laugh at it. It's just so good!
1/5. Too much volcano. No volcano. Would not visit again.
got emotional seeing natsukis reaction to his room
Aaaaawesome!!! 🌋👍
Me when Joey said Chris could beatbox,  :o  Me when he does it. :O
Actually impressed by the video. Joey clearly has a career as a go-go dancer if the anime thing doesn't work out. You should put "Too much Volcano" on iTunes and give Natsuki that break into the music industry!
Too Much Volcano soundin like a bootleg version of Trash Tastes outro
That rap song was like Eminem if he was an Australian weeb who moved to Japan, LOVED IT THO 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Honestly, "too much volcano" was fucking fantastic 🤣 props to you guys it was great
A. S. O. Too much volcano
My favourite thing about this series is Joeys low key fear of what the hell Natsuki is going to do next. You can see it in the eyes and its killing me. Also I've been to Aso like 12 years ago though. So old 😭
That Junji Mito, Uzumaki spiral shirt.
So, when is the album coming out?
Eminem has been really quiet after Joey and Natsuki spit those bars
Damn son
Always nice to have a new episode of journey across Japan on my Monday morning :)
Wasn't the rug blue?
Was gonna comment how hungover hyped up Natsuki looks at 9:22 rubbing his knees, but then the ASO RAP video just blew me away! Wow, what a great effort on this one! By the way, Aso and Kurokawa are some of my favorite places in Japan. I went there alone on my first trip to Japan, and returned with my gf a few years later. Such a magical place!
A full british, half-japanese and a full japanese, the trio is complete.
Hello Mr Chris, Joey & Natsuki. Great video. To be honest, I was never too founded with rap song, but the song too much volcano is very catchy. Thank you very much for the all your hard works
Imagine the guys are watching this in 20 years from now. This is an kodak moment
19:29  Black tatami in the Japanese safari
Christ: “ So like, how many words of volcano should we put in there.”  Natsuki: “ Yes.. ASO”
Damn that rap song was banging <3
Thank you guys for making my Monday morning 10 times better. For someone who would dearly love to visit Japan but will probably never be able to afford to your videos are a good way to kind of visit. Great rap video and still not enough volcano!
I actually like your song
17:06 what's going on with Chris's bed 👀
Requesting for a 10hr version of Chris beatboxing!
Thanks Chris, for making grandad cardigans fashionable again.
❤ this channel
Been checking my feed everyday waiting for this ! Glad to have it while i work overnight :P
Destination: Mount Aso Be Drawing me in like a Lasso Yeah this place is top classo Let me draw you a picture - im straight up Picasso
3 years in the future : Chris returns to stay a night at Igloo A
This and geowizards straight line mission are the best series on YouTube
What makes a good song? Getting stuck in your head ... good job!!! It's actually an enjoyable rap song. I have seen/heard way worse from people who do rapping for a living.
Rhyming volcano with volcano - dropping lines reminiscent of one of the greatest lyricists of our time, Pitbull with his masterpiece: We at the hotel, motel, holiday inn. We at the hotel, motel, holiday inn. We at the hotel, motel, holiday inn. We at the hotel, motel, holiday inn.
You guys need your own TV show! Love it!
soooo....when is the rap song going on sale,and where may we get it ? cant have too much volcano ^^
The world needs a band teeshirt to support the continued rapping of Natsuki
EXTRA SALAMI
Can’t get this song out of my head
Your intro always puts a smile on my face!!! It's as if I'm going on a great adventure!!!!!!!! AhhhhhSO PUMPDT
A S O~~ Tooo much Volcanoo~~ Bet this is gonna be used in the next tourism advert to get people to go to ASO by the tourism board
He's putting the Wilhelm scream in every video 🤣 Nice one Chris! Loving every episode 😁👍
Awesome video once again Chris. 😊😆👍
Best series on the youtubes, love it!!
That rap was like the onsen. Piping hot!
2:14 Rock Natsuki unleashed
BEST VIDEO YET LOVED IT!!!!!
What an edition! Feels like I'm watching tv
0:50 *Life is not Daijoubu*
lowkey slaps no cap
Aso too much volcano will be stuck in my head for atleast a week.
This is just art thanks Chris
Shame Cris wasn't in the rap video at all
Why does Chris know how to beat box xD
I just realized that joey has thing of climbing in to bathtubs he just can't keep his legs 😂😂😂.   Ngl the rap is pretty catchy 😂😂😂👍👍👍🔥🔥🔥
Ok but that rap is actually a great time 💁🏻‍♀️💅🏻✨
That rap slaps
Lol. You guys nailed it.
That song is fire
I feel like this is an expansion pack!❤️
I dare you to release Too Much Volcano separately
Love the song!  🌋👌
I hate the fact that the challenges are scripted... They are supposed to be composing the song during the stay at the ryokan, but they already sing it on top of the volcano....
That private onsen place looks sunning!  Definitely going on my bucket list!
That music video is freaking amazing!!! You guys need to copyright it and release it on Spotify and other music services.
That rap sounded great! I think you should do a rap at the end of journey across Japan summing up what you did
21:23
Wow 9 hour write, edit, and shoot <3  Awesome sauce <3 :D LOVE THE RAP TRACK MANNNN <3 :3
rap sounds better than cardi B ngl😆
If I didn't know the channel and came accross your rap song, I would find it remarkably less unpleasant than most so called professional rap.
Natsuki was crying because sulfur dioxide gas hitting your eyes forms dilute sulfuric acid. Additionally, sulfur dioxide gas is a skin irritant causing pain, itching, and possibly a rash.
1000/10. What a video.
OMG! Someone needs to make that rap go viral...Never can have "Too Much Volcano"
tremendous rap!
Warning Sign: "Evacuate Immediately" Chris: Let's go closer.
8/10 Too much volcano.
way better than sixnine
WOW No Volcano was so well done, Joey you smashed the lyrics and the video was amazing. when you guys releasing on itunes?!?!
Amazing rap video 😆😆😆
The song is unironically catchy and the music video is stunningly well made
please release the song on spotify !
That song is stuck in my head now
SO MUCH VOLCANO :0
I was smiling within the first 10 seconds of the song. The Wilhelm scream was a nice touch xD. "Thalasso" may have been adequate to rhyme with Aso.  It could have been appropriate with the bath/onsen that followed. I got the song stuck in my head now.  Nice challenge and bloody well done.
A S O  To much volcano
Me as I drift off to sleep: aso.... TOO MUCH VOLCANO.
Now available on iTunes....
For a rap and music video made in 9 hours, that was amazingly well done
Chris Abroad’s next collaboration - Rick Beato “What Makes This Song Great: Too Much Volcano.” . . . provided it doesn’t get blocked.
Really enjoyed that as always!! Made me laugh!
I can't believe we're getting this level of video production quality and entertainment for free! Video was on point, and the 9-hr rap was way better than some music studios' 6-month long production. Can't wait for the next ep.
I must say, that is quite a large vehicle.
Beat that Chris made reminds me of sailor moon outro back in the day ( fox kids memories🤩)
I'm going to have "A.S.O so much volcano" in my head for a while.
can i ask why have to stir the bath 15:42sec ?
I'm actually very impressed with how they can throw together these ad hoc video challenges in so little time and make them look really good. There are many YouTubers who can spend months doing similar things and don't come even close to the quality and entertainment value as Chris and company can.
Who doesn't want to see Chris and Joey all hot and wet in Natsuki's deep cave... in 4K!
Iconic. Just do a rap song in every destination, never mind other challenges.
Now that I heard Joey rap, I want a Mori X AnimeMan music Collab!!
your videos are great and now you have also a rap video. everybody have done a great job. 😁👍💯❤
I want a friend like natsuki 😂😂😂
Get in the bath Natsuki 👏👏👏
too much volcano
I want the rap as my ringtone
I'm soo hooked at A-S-O too much volcano 🤣🌋
This is absolutely amazing 🙏🙏🙏
It’s a bop! I loved the effort you all put into the rap video 😊 when are you guys dropping it as a single on Spotify 😛
why was the song so good HAHAHAH
The cinematography of the rap song is amazing and the lyrics... I guess the best one can make about this particular topic.. XD
Joeys part in Kono Dio Da killed so I'm sure they're rap will be fine
other Rap Video: Lush Expensive Supercar    Too Much Volcano: A F*ckin Minibus
The rap music video was...VOLCANIC!
Great stuff Chris!!! That rap yo...
props for the production man !! amazing !!
The rap 🤣🙌🏻 so good
This is like an anime series , finish watching one episode and you already cant wait for the next.
great rap xD
That's actually really good guys. Very catchy!
Good job on the rap song! So much fun you guys!!
Fire rap song tho 😂🔥
You guys really should've consulted with the rap god himself, Grant from The Anime Zone
amazung
Love the Rap song!! keep safe guys!
Know what else would have rhymed, joey? Taste of umami. Even works with the meat theme ;)
I really enjoyed the song! Could definitely chart in the UK 😁
Good on Chris to splurge for Natsuki's vacation.That guy needed a much deserved leisure time.Especially after losing his pirate pants.
A S O so much volcano no volcano no volcano A S O too much volcano nowhere nowhere oh my god!!!
You're simply the perfect trio: sarcastic Chris, childish joey and crazy Natsuki
I want too much volcano  on spotify xD
I think I enjoyed that rap mv way too much.
Are you wearing the swimming trunks in the bath even if the camera is not recording?
That rap song was awful but I love it
Soooo, now that chorus is bloody stuck in my head loop. <3
"Too much volcano.... no volcano" Natsuki be talking the language of the gods.
Put the music on Spotify 😂😂😂
15 seconds in and i already splashed my coffee over my monitor. SO MUCH VOLCANO
Love it! Me and my husband really love your videos! We cannot wait to go back to Japan again!
Lyrics  Check it Kumamoto  The land of the hills and the grottos  Welcome to the roadshow of the nippon trio We’re in the dome home And wouldn’t you know We’ve got first class tickets  To the Royal zone I’ve got the flow Chris got the pay My man Natsuki, tell them what you say  A S O So much volcano  No volcano  No volcano A S O Too much volcano  Nowhere  Nowhere  Oh my god  Now we’re chilling at the peak of the volcano It looks kinda bleak but it’s ok tho I’m with the bros Surrounded by the sulphur clouds So brace yourselves cause it’s about to get loud  A S O Too much volcano  No volcano  No volcano  A S O Danger volcano *wilhelm scream* No volcano No volcano   By the way it’s Natsuki’s holiday A getaway to a far away place of stay Kurokawa black River like these tatami  I like pizza EXTRA SALAMI  A S O So much volcano No volcano No volcano A S O Too much volcano Nowhere  Nowhere  Oh my god  We’re in the onsen my boys and I We be shabbing in the banks by the riverside JAJ you’ve just been defeated I dare say That’s challenge completed  A S O So much volcano  No volcano  No volcano  A S O Too much volcano  Nowhere  Nowhere  Oh my god
why do I always see Joey in a bathtub on this channel. Chris, I am sensing a theme on this channel.
As someone who usually doesn't care about rap music: I love this!   The dome houses are so cute! But being too small even for Japanese people does indeed drop a hint why they are not that populair...
This video and song is definitely one I didn’t know I needed but I absolutely love it! Would’ve loved to see Chris in it though! 10/10 would buy this song🙏💖 Such a good collab of people to make a rap like this, when is the next track going to drop? 👀
Stay safe mate, too much volcano 🌋
Too much volcano is 100 times better than everyday bro
the huts remind me about dragon ball houses
Very good mate! Love your work
Spotify and apple music release when?!!!
Very impressive coming up with a catchy rap song in less than 24 hours 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
I stopped watching this channel since Chris started making videos with that guy with the zero personality. Even his solo videos started to get boring :(  Still subbed, the old content was real good, sometimes I rewatch some of those
okay but how is the rap actually kinda good tho
Now I know what I'm going to be listening on the loop. ASO, so much volcano. C'mon. 🙆‍♂️🙆‍♂️
Why the song isn't on spotify already?
Abroad in Japan comes out with the next banger hit. It's going to be all over the internet and Spotify.
This episode was actually really epic xD
Glad to see you guys have so much fun! That music video was brilliant!
I would love to stay in the igloo villa hahahah 🥰 really cool 😎 loving this series , this should be on tv ❤️ big love from England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
You should sell that Rap song. Make some money for the next Journey Across Japan 😂
What a great rap duo although risottoro could have possibly added another element 😂
That was nice
THAT SONG WAS INSANELY GOOD FOR SOMETHING MADE IN 9 HOURS #ASOGANG
Props to Joey he has nice lyrics and the adlips were good too 🤹‍♂️
you have no idea how much I enjoy your videos, no matter what mood im in they always put a smile on my face. you guys are all so funny and the filming and effort that goes into these videos is amazing!! 💕
Natsuki for the win
I’m gonna make a point to share this music moment w/ Mount Rainer, so it can proxy travel too. 🏔
awesome rap video :D
NASA would love it :))
the music video is a meme waiting to explode
What's the name of the app Chris used?
4:03 i like how Natsuki respond in english naturally now
Oh no....... This will stay in my head all day.   Too much volcano....
Please release it separately on Spotify and as a clip. It will be a hit. Or have you done it already?
That was so good in a weird yet catchy way
When does the album drop?
The song was surprisingly good haha
I thought you rap song was great I love your videos thank you so much
Im a huge fan of quirky home designs, the igloo homes seem so practical and I would not mind living in one
I never thought that would be so catchty
6:26 ha that building looks like a you know what
Haha absolutely amazing rap!!
Chris, we need hour-long episodes for "Journey Across Japan". 25 mins is not enough.
Volcano - ok though... some sick wordsmithing right there!
Hilarious rap
funny because aso , means a family that is very rude and dirty , in my language X)
Now my brain is going to whisper to me for the  next few days "ASO so much volcano, ASO too much volcano."
so.. when is it coming out on itunes and spotify?
A.S.O too much volcano, A.S.O ...   I can't get it out of my head, TY!
Epiiiiiiiiccccc !!!!!
Why is the rap song surprisingly good 💀😆
something nice
Natsuki is radiating happiness at the start of the video. Looks like he really needed that holiday!
I love it all super rap
Please put "Too Much Volcano" on Spotify so I can bump in my car 🤣👌
Just randomly discovered that all the previous "Journeys" and "Natskuki: the Movie" have their entries on IMDB.
So Chris is a boomer who can beatbox?
Well done gents. Enjoying the adventures!
We cant have JAJ and not have another Doctor Jelly ad.  Edit: Joey’s dance will be popularized very soon. Especially as a Trash Taste Meme.
Wow there are parts of the countryside in this that look very similar to Scotland
I found my next song to use when scammers call me. +chef's kiss+ Absolute masterpiece.
Just when JAJ couldn't get any better, Chris and the boys have surpassed even higher limits with this.
Well that's going to be stuck in my head all day... thanks :)
The rap is bloody brilliant
Got bars man
That igloo house looks like a capsule corp from dragon Ball
Please release the rap as a stand alone video to make it easier to add to a youtube music playlist
“Deep cave” *tocktocktock”
Me: What a great episode, but such a corny rap song at the end… Me hours later: A S O… Too much volcano!
Anyone else heard ' Hey ass hole . No volcanos. ' instead of ASO
Not a bad rap, but Natsuki pretty much felt the groove and matched it, but Joey did a damn fine job with the lyrics. Cheers bois! I envy your great time in this video amongst the others, youve made me seriously look at spending the money to explore Japan 🤘
10/10 best music video, need more
That rap is DOOOPE
Guys thats really the most you ever put into a challenge it exceeded expectations. Joey great lyrics nataski for being you and great music and video chris.
that music video deserves another video
Mount Aso Too much gas let go Mount Aso... Is this safe? Lets go!
Comment++
"I'm climber" laughs in 2 packs of Marlboro cigarettes
Three crazy youtubers just made a weird rap song about their day, and it's better than any mainstream crap they call music in the last 10 years.
Traveling across Japan making rap song with your friends  Isn't that just the dream?
Amazing as always. You gotta have the trash taste boys for the next one or both Ryotaro and Natsuki.
after being friends with you for a long time, Natsuki's English is still quite limited. Practice more Natsuki, you can do it
The music video was surprisingly catchy hahaha it has a ear worm beat to it 😄
You can never have too much volcano ......... well done chaps.
Damn I didn’t know Cris could beatbox, mans basically a pro
Thank you so much for the Video. I stayed two times at Kurokawa Onsen. In Ryokan Sanga. Great memories. Hope f%&§... Corona is better soon. Cant wait to come back to Japan. Nex time make the Rotenburo Meguri: Onsen-Hopping in Kurokawa, this is great for a two day tripp.  Thanks guys :)
They almost got it right 🤣, just a couple inflexions and lyrics more you would've had a hit guys 🤦
JAV...Journey Across Volcano...ASOOOO!!!!!!
Ngl that rap was kinda fire
"Shabbing" is genuinely a good word.
great job on the rap loved it so did my kids
Something nice!
Natsuki was robbed of his Grammy this year
8:10 Is that a threat?
so when do you guys go on tour?? I loved this challenge so much! :)
that rap was LIT!
Amazing video! Love it!  #toomuchvolcano
That's was a really good rap song guys noice 👍 👍🍻
Amazing! Or as we germans say: big cinema! The rap is right out there with the biggest hits like PPAP and Gangnam Style! If this doesn't blow up, maybe the volcano will.
Ha ha ha loved the rap song 😄
Classic Journey Across Japan. Chris: Corr Blimey Natsuki this is amazing wot u fink for true? Natsuki: My balls ache...best bed maybe? Joey: *endless laughter as he guffaws into the void that only Hentai can fill* Chris: You're a card you be Natsuki. Natsuki: Blood for the Blood God! Chris: Natsuki no! Put down the knife! Joey look out! *intro music plays*
i am glad that the anime man joined this trip.
I give the Volcano Rap the thumbs up. It works.
Super! Great rap!
Somehow the igloo village reminds me of the show Lazy Town. It looks semi cartoonish.
My favourite episode so far
Haha! Great video always. The rap was hilarious and funny. Your videos are always cheering me up whilst lockdown in London, UK.
Came for the JAJ. Stayed for the rap video.
why isnt youtube putting ads in this video? give me ads i want to watch ads for this content and support this hardworking creator , dont put ads on shitty videos
That's awesome 3:29 those are totally Goku's house style :)
Natsuki's part is catchy, Joey's part is great.
"Too much volcano" listening it on loop
Now do a Japanese version!
I caught myself humming and mumbling all morning 😄 This goddamn catchy tune...there is never too much volcano!
Journey across japan without nataski is like sea without water..
I had noooo idea Chris could beat box. 🤩
Nice rap. Has a catchy tune and decent lyrics. Looking forward to next episode.
That moment when Youtube made me watch the music video first. 😂😂😂😂😂  That song is still lit.
Sick ass rap!
ASO = Awesome! :D
Quite catchy
That wilhelm scream doing the rap was absolutely fantastic
21:25 the meat of the video - for shabbing
Quality entertainment! The amount of work that goes into these is absolutely admirable.
Who is Natsuki?
Today literally I hiked the worlds most active volcano. 5mi crater rim hike  🌋🤙🏽🤙🏽
Excellent:), thanks guys!
The rap song was legitimately great
I mean it makes sense to make some earthquake proof houses near a volcano
The best song (about ASO Volcano)! :))))
Is it an episode unless they end up in a bathtub together?
Chris in 2018: Mustache Brit  Chris now: Elon Musk Ripoff
Too much volcano is an amazing song
This is the first of me hearing Chris can beatbox
eye that was a nice rap song *one hour later* A S O  SO MUCH VOLCANO TOO MUCH VOLCANO- It's stuck in my head and it's not going away-
Hi, I was wondering what’s the name of the place you’ve stayed in Kurokawa?
Okay but like. Why did too much volcano actually slap though? LOL great video guys, love these series
Comment
Haaaa  loved it
Here before Chris  gets a whole Netflix special for himself
That Rap Song is awesome! A..S...O...
08:35 is that a CGI Hawk right there?
That Rap turned out better than expected, you need to show this to Mori Calliope! :D
You should upload the rap as a stand alone video, that kinda thing usually gets loads of views.
Enjoying this, Calpis in hand, all the way from the Netherlands....but feeling a little closer
Chris kinda looks like budget Elon Musk
Thats a pretty decent music. Really fun to watch and hear.
fun stuff, excelent...
Too much volcano 🌋!!!!!!
That beat was awesome but was disappointed that Abroad wasn't in the video rapping. Maybe next time or have him make a punk song.
"Chillin' with ma boys in Kurokawa onsen Beers in hand and a Shabu Shabu Johnson"
$100 a night AND I get to stay in something that looks like the capsule houses from “Dragon Ball”?  Sign me up.
Joey can rap and Natsuki's the best homie.....
thanks Richard /s
Grandmaster Flash would be proud for the track
Too much volcano is my new favourite catch line :D
It reminds me of the midget village Karl visits in an idiot abroad
If that song gets stuck in my head, I will personally write to *your* local representative to petition them to make it a crime for you to produce anything resembling music.
That 'RAP song' was so terrible that it turned to be very entertaining. Thank you for the laughs and for being such awesome sports and I'm very excited for the next episode.
First class tickets to the (Flintstone?) Royal Zone!  Danger volcano!  Nowhere...  seriously priceless artistry here.  It is indeed like a magic!   Top shelf, boys!
Chris hasn't learnt his lesson about insulting Japanese bathtubs 😂
I love Natsuki 😂 such a fun and nice personality it seems.
AbroadinJapanVeVo
That’s right volcanoes do come pretty surprisingly.
Never in my life have I wanted so much volcano.
Damn elon musk made it to "mars"
Ngl it's actually very good and catchy
That was better than any other rap song I've ever heard, music video too.
The rap was amazing
Those houses are Capsule Corp ones from DBZ lol
the best rap of 2021
I really love this TRIO Genuinely 😆🥰🤣🤩
Ha ha ha ha!🤣 What else is there to say.🌋
Bruh this song hella flaming 🤣
The rap song was pretty good
Where can I buy the "To Much Volcano" album?🤔
I genuinely liked the music video so much, Not bad at all. Gotta love these challenges
You know what, fair play on making a pretty decent song and music video in less than a day! It's actually really impressive!
The rap is so damn catchy! It should win all the awards!!
Joey's choo choo train dance motion had me rolling 😂
The music had too much volcano. 9/10
This is some next level video....great edit as always.
I fully expect to hear this song on the TV news report when the volcano next erupts.
The rap had me laughing the whole time :D. Now I can't wait for Dr.Jelly to make a return.
This video turned a bad day into a good one. Thank you!!! ❤️
That Wilhelm scream at 22:55 fits perfectly! It sounds just like Natsuki! 😂❤
Grammys SOTY!! STREAM!!!!
So glad natsuki is there love that guy
When is the rap on Spotify?
They always wanted do the rap song
Beer every night, huh. Do Journey Across Germany next!
I have seen so much worse music videos that cost millions of dollars and then there is Chris apologizing for only having 9hours but made one of the best rap mvs ever :D i really like the chilly beat ✨
Will "too much volcano" be available on Spotify?
The Japanese top 10 charts need to brace them selves for to much volcano lol. Good shit mate
Great video, I love that rap video 😂
three boy's one volcano
Only complaint was Chris didn’t appear in the rap video
In our Language the word "ASO" means too things  For the Tagalog dialect its means "Dog" And for the Visayan dialect it means "Smoke'
Indeed, too much 'volacano', which is one X'D
this is the best vid I have ever seen 🤣
Create your own anime intro with your own theme song
Nowhere nowhere too much volcano 😂👏 👏 🙌🙌 Just as good as Rick & Mortys stage performance 😝
Your Video's helped me get through the Pandemic Lock-downs Chris!! Keep making your amazing videos!! Looking forward to watching them!! ^^
U guys r the best, I was having a hard day and u made me laugh
As always amazing work Chris!!! and the rap song *chef's kiss
i loved the rap.
You guys were in bathing suits THE WHOLE TIME, way to break the allusion Smh
I can only imagine the embarrassment trying the film the rap video…….
too much volcano
Chris has apps for all occasions to perform any challenges
Mount Aso's peak looks like mini Mount Bromo peak
Release this song  .... 👍😂
Damn fucking good 🔥
The beatbox at starts gives me Katamari Damacy ost vibes!
Brilliant!!!!   Loved it all!!!!  Damn song won't get out of my head!!!!!    I love it. <3
Nice , together "A S O So Much Volcano!"
How I've longed for the intro music
Epic!
I love it!!! too much volcano
Please put this song on Spotify, I want to listen it over and over 😍😍😂😂
standalone video for "too much volcano" gotta happen asap Chris
Stream their latest rap single for clear skin ❤️
Good thing u had a two musicians with you on the trip!
Best rap song 😂
*something nice about the rap song*
You really should upload Too Much Volcano as it’s own vid so people can binge watch it
I would like to stay at that place!
good job on the video guys!
The Guy asked to rap about the video but they dropped a bloody decently produced music video. There's nothing known as too much when it comes to Journey Across Japan challenges. P.S. Those igloos(especially the royal ones) look something out of JRR Tolkien's Middle Earth, like the hobbits home
Was that one time when he was saying I have A bad case of diarrhea
That rap was actually super fire. Props to the Nippon trio for this masterpiece
So much bolkaino
EPIC!!!
Aso too much volcano reminds me of the dance to learn English video
the rap is just straight fire
I laughed and amazed at the same time at the song
Seriously, where can I download that song? 😁
Might just start a petition to make Chris release this on Spotify
Capsule Corps from Dragon Ball IRL
Can't wait to see it on iTunes now
yes!
Uncanny Lost vibes from that village. Beware of strange aggressive smoke from Tabaccottage.
9:23 That seatbelt it begging for its life
A hit song that erupted....just like a volcano!
Hello
They destroyed this challenge. I liked it.
top tier rap
where is the spotify link gor too much volcano?
That was a lot of fun
I humbly request that "Too Much Volcano - JAJ [MV]" be released as a separate video and on iTunes.
nailed the challenge! one of the best! phenomenal!!
Great RAP guys. and music was so much better than I expected. that must be a nice app. )
that rap was brilliant!
The rap makes this episode one of the best
SPITTING HOT VOLCANO
My never ending cycle of despair just halted for 25 minutes
👍👍👍
Boyz: sorry if its shit Song: fucking LIT  Dr jelly rap would have been sick though, i still cant stop watching that "ad" also gave up smoking tabacoo now for 6 months now, cmon natsuki, jus dew it.
What a banging rap video!!! That's definitely going on the playlist
You know what that was a pretty good rap for saying you only had several hours. I'd by it.
Too much volcano will go down in abroad in Japan history
Hang on a minute...the Volcano warning light fantastic, is on yellow...which under "What to do" Says evacuate immediately ..Always knew Chris was a monster.
ngl the rap video is actually pretty good
LOVED THE SONG... Too much volcano... <3
We came to this channel for japan but we stayed for Chris and his friends!
Am I the only one noticing the title song is misspelled "VolAcano" ? :D
Love the disco beat! aso volcano....Natsuki you are my man!
YO THIS ACTUALLY LITTT 🔥
Natsuki is very funny😀
Natsuki’s the fucking best
I’m not gonna lie. For $100,those lil “igloo” hotels are cute,on the inside of them. And looking at the  whole area,outside.it looks like a SMURF village.lol(which I find adorable) lol
If you want an idea of what the app Chris had can do I recommend the channel @AsthmaBB. NCS music of many genres
Play that in my funeral.
the rap is gettho, i LOVE IT!
Nice dancing joey, what a legend!
Is the rap song now part of the trash taste lore ?
In this episode of Chris, Joey and natsuki's bizarre adventure they experienced worst igloo hotel and had to made a rap song for this journey.
Too Much Volcano!!! Nowhere, Nowhere!!! lol its catchy!
Dear Chris, pls pls be nice to Natsuke. He deserves it 🤗 Greetings from Switzerland
Should've added the Donald duck lol
ASO needs it’s own separate video
PUT THE SONG ON 1.25 SPEED, it's on a whole other level good
Capsules from DBZ
14:42 Now that was an authentic reaction 😂
A S O
Way to much volcano 🔥🔥
What rhymes with "Black Tatami"? MOM'S SPAGHETTI!
Too much volcano 🤣🤘
Indeed challange completed. Just know why you guys failed the first challange. You didn't try to catch bugs. If you fail to catch fish or wild game (which is best in the morning) then there's always creepy crawlers the planet is filled with it
Bro when you guys going on tour
Natsuki: " So much volcano" Also Natsuki: "No volcano"  Hmmmm yes it all makes sense now.
less go
Black tatami, it ain't salami. Me and my wagyu, we shabing.
Those igloo houses remind me of the capsule houses in Dragon Ball  Z
Catchy song. Great video. Loved the places you visited.
Too Much Volcano flippin' slaps
Why does the rap song remind me of those old Bill Nye the science guy music videos/rap videos about science. It was awesome btw to make a rap music video from scratch in that short amount of time!
"Too much volcano" was hot hot hot
subtitles pls
You more than made up for the 1st failure with that banger of a song <3
loved the rap! nice one guys!
Can I get that song on Spotify? Thanks
A S O SO MUCH VOLCANO
Absolutely killed this boys, bloody loved it!
Hats down to y'all. The song is so catchy, I think it's gonna stick in my head for the next weeks. Grammys' nominees should buckle up, cause they're gonna have a tough competition!
The government should pay you for the production of such awesome publicity
Woah I didn’t know Chris can beatbox 😂
Excellent production value as always! Great to see you boys having a fun time, and Natsuki's energy is contagious!
"A S O so much volcano, no volcano"  Don't crack me up lol
I blame you to have this stuck in my head now... A - S - O .. So much Volcanoooo
I ship Chris and Joey 😩😩😩💦
Eminem has been realy quiet since this dropped.
A-S-O too much volcano, back it up bois we got it. 😂👏👏👏  Edit: Eminem been real quiet since this banger dropped
I'm not saying the Migos are scared of the Nippon Trio, but it's quite the coincidence they made sure to drop Culture III before Too Much Volcano came out...
High key fire great job on the song!!! I want more!
A-S-O, too much volcano 🤩 😅 I liked the rap video very much, well done, challenge completed 👍🏻🤭   The video is as usual very interesting and entertaining.
Natsuki is literally the cutest, haha.
to much volcano,  heart is on remo...
Its lit
The lads are back and better than ever. The Aso Farm Village reminds me of The Village from The Prisoner for some reason. The style is completely different, but I guess they both look like secluded, dystopian villages. And what a rap song and music video.
OMG this made my day! This is my favourite trio. Can't wait to see more from you.
I’ve been watching your videos for at least 3 years now thank you for giving me some entertainment so I can enjoy and try to get my mind off of life I struggle with depression and anxiety a lot and watching your videos relaxes me thank you Chris
THE SONG AND THE MUSIC VIDEO IS ACTUALLY GOOD😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
At this point I'm looking for the dog and the point where you go around solving mysteries.
Y’all ever shab your homies gn?
Too much volcano is so unironically good i feel weird now
New music video right from MTV 'Too Much Volcano' has become Number One Hit of this Summer 2021!
This series wont survive without Natsuki
Better than the last two Psy songs I heard 👏👏
Amazing rap hahaha love it
"Beef or chicken?" 10:59
A S O The song's great tho!
What is "IT"? You know, that intangible quality that makes an audience like an artist, performer, celebrity? One sees it here with Chris, his merry band of travelers and film team. No "all about me" reality show forced hijinks, manufactured shock and awe, or separation above the audience for the experience - just genuine, sincere [can't fake that] travel adventure with genuine curiosity, sharing the journey, and friendships. Regardless of age, gender, culture, background, that authentic connection is what makes good films, and relationships, and will always capture an audience attention, long term. Every human wants to find 'so much volcano' - thanks director for a little vision to get there, if only imagination. And Joey was spitting the lyrics - and - dance choreography, extra gold star! It is not the years in your life, but the life, and companions, in your years, that make living worthwhile. Chris took that leap with JET program and continues to carpe that diem, and thanks for the chance to tag along.
When Natsuki said "Too much volcano" I FELT that.
Natsuki, Japan's answer to PSY. That track will be in my head for days..
Natsuki 🤩🤩🤩
Nice job love the song.
Absolutely amazing
Was there a spelling mistake in the song title for “Too Much Volacano?” Epic song BTW! Love the Danger Volcano transition to Wilhelm Scream! Will this be released on Apple Music in Spatial Audio, Lossless and Hi-Res Lossless?? :)
Bruh that rap pretty dope 🔥
God bless this shit
Omg the song turned out so good! The chorus will be stuck in my head for the rest of day 😂
Awesome work u've made in the music video I love all the fun u guys bring!! 🤩🤗
is this rap song available on iTunes or spotify ? <3 :'D
I need to know which music app Chris used!! I'm looking desperately for one
Almost like hobbit houses...right?😅
"closest thing to mars"....mars is red not black, Chris.  Closest thing to mars would be Petra/Jordan.
Wow simply awesome!!! Loved the rap loved the content. You guys hearts just shine, it's obvious your great friends and are having a great time
Joey killed the rhymes and vocals. He really carried the song.
Upload ASO separately
Love this challenge! I'm glad to see you guys pull your skills together to produce a pretty baller song that I'm going to listen to when I get up in the morning. Joey got bars! If you ask me, there's not enough volcano!
why does the rap actually slap holy shit
That trip looks so fun. I hope you guys have a great time and the rap was also quite catchy!
I'm pretty sure I'm going to have A S O Too much volcano stuck in my head for a while.  Thanks guys.  Great video!
I'm using the chorus of the rap song as a ring tone for certain "difficult" people in my life. 😁  Well done guys!
Every time they hit up Kyushu and skip over my old stomping grounds of Oita, I shed the smallest of tears :'(
*A..........S...........O*
Im imagining that Chris learned beatboxing while avoiding studying kanji his first year in Japan lol
So when is it getting released on iTunes?
Natsuki has the charisma that makes me believe everything he says no matter how absurd. Natsuki is just the best
Now we need a separate release for the song.
That's lit yo
Shabbin’ with the boys
Hardest banger 2021
can't wait to see the next eps 🙏🎉🎉
That rap song was gold. 🙌🏻😂🔥
joey really did say "DEEZ TATAMI" and pointed to his nuts. goddamn
🤣🤣🤣
Upload the rap on a seperate video :)
So good
It reminds me of that houses from Dragon Ball
That big centipede in the preview got my skin crawling
Such a catchy song can actually be on repeat, can't wait for it to be on Spotify aha
Too much volcano be looking like an action trailer
Finding out that Chris can Beatbox has me motivated lmao
well done Nippon Trio!
I wanna download this song XD
I see doketo jelly make a cameo, nice!
Make the rap a separate clip I bet it will go viral
It’s catchy… now it’s stuck in my head for fuck’s sake… too much volcano… xD
why do i actually like the song XD
Dude this is actually amazing. The production quality of journey across Japan 3 feels like a whole different animal than the first 2 times. It feels like I'm watching a TV show. On that note, take care of yourself Chris and don't kill yourself editing all night like you did last time.
the rap is amazing even though it is made within a day
Mmmmmm, man soup.......
Just wait and see, No More Volcano is going to win a Grammy and be in Billboard 100
To much volcano now trending
Holy shit...The song is actually really really good.....Joey and Natsuki got some bars....
Can we get the song as a short? Dude I loved it, really felt some old school rap vibes, I really enjoyed it and love the show. Please? 🙏 Thank you 🤘
The igloo/dome village would look like a legit town from Kenshi if it was in the middle of a desert.
honestly the rap was a bop
Wow 9 hours for the rap video, it was amazing. I wonder what it would be like if you had more time? Thanks for sharing Japan with us.
i laughed with tears
OMG!   funniest shit ever......  no volcano!
So... Is there only rap par mv? I feel that would be trending xD
natsuki really trying to speak english it's cute
that rap slaps!
Fun coincidence: "Aso" means smoke in Visaya language.
16:52 - had to double check if Joey was wearing a G-string or not....
I'd love to hear Natsuki rapping for real
That was dope
The rap about the volcano, hell yeah guys!
Something nice
Natsuki looks sickly... I hope he quits smoking and gets healthier. I'd love to see him stick around for many years.
Awesome episode love the scenery 💕👍😊
Still cant get over fhe fact that Natsuki is married!! Tot he is forever a man child!
That song was actually pretty good. I would love to see a song colab from Joey and Calliope Mori with Chris making the beat.
It amazes me that you even managed to add the infamous wilhelm scream to the rap song XD What a video to wake up to. Thanks for the amazing work!
Where can we get A S O themed merch 🤞🤞
What is this now "The third season of JAJ" 😆 it feels more like a tv show now So much better than YouTube videos 😌
I loooove this series!!!!
Best rap since the Ninja Rap by Vanilla Ice.
A-S-O too much volcano! Letsgo!!
black tatami... Asahi. Would have been better. Other than that, awesome!
i was about to hit the dislike button but then Too Much Volcano plays and i just have to give the like for that one
This is the cringiest rap song I've ever heard🤣 Love it😂😂
Anyone know what the app he made the beat on is called?
I had no clue Chris could beatbox, this guy impresses me more with each video
Too much volcano but no volcano
sick raps and humor aside, idk it was nice seeing that big smile on natsuki’s face when he was checking out his special room and you can hear chris was excited for him. like chris knows his friend works so hard and deserved this for his holiday.
RAP 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Fond memories of my road trip through Kyushu. Thanks for the great upload :) It's a tune at the end.
Holy shit the rap video was 1000 times better then I expected... That was brilliant. I would listen to this daily, seriously.
Jeez that was frickin amazing! You guys did that in a day, mindblowing
Amazing rap video guys 🤣 I died at joeys dancing,  there should be a whole video of that on loop.
The rap song was really good! A lot of fun!
so much volcano best birthday gift ever
the rap is dope >w<
other people: let's go to Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, Sapporo, Kobe, Nara  JAJ Fans: next time I go to Japan, I'm Going To A S O, the place where there are too much Volcano
I think the effort put into the rap totally makes up for not completing that first challenge. Joey did work with the random grab bag of lyrics. A S O Too Much Volcano
🤣🤣 Looking forward to the next one
Does it not snow at that farm village? If it does how do they get out of the house with the doors opening outward? Edit: Who would have thought 2021 would be the year that spawned the most powerful rap duo? Trio if you count the creator of those beats.
Spotify when ?
It's not journey across Japan until Joey is in a bathtub
He says 'we did the challenge' having not taking part in the actual video-clip!
Ayo that rap is fire🔥🔥🔥🤩🤩🤩 Need it on Spotify ASAP 🥺 Would love to have more music tracks with you three lol😌
Thanks for the Entertaining video👍😊. Take care keep smiling.
Love the song well done guys you did so well in such a short time. It's stuck in my head. ASO to much volcano, no volcano
Very "Fresh Prince of Bel Air" style Rap ! I like it !
Natsuki has legit rapper vibes!
If there’s any justice in this world, “Too Much Volcano” will make it to Spotify
Natsuki should play Bane in the next Batman movie...
Too much volcano! Loved it, well played lads
i hate how this song is so catchy. now i can't get it out of my head
Damn th song turned out really nice.
Another epic video 👏🏻
Joey's got bars.
Wait, Natsuki has a channel?
It's better than the latest from Cardi B. Not sure if this is a compliment or not
Imagine if Aso decide to get Chris to do some special advertisement for their tourism board due to this. 😂
Brilliant effort with Too Much Volcano. You had some spectacular scenery to pull it off. Watched it twice.
I'm half surprised Cali wasn't consulted. Having said that, Joey already has solid flow and wouldn't need help anyway. Nice Job though!
A-S-O Too Much Volcano is big in Japan. Well done guys!
How is he doing this so professionally. Everytime i watch a new video i get more addicted to his videos. Love all 3 of you. And the RAP was amazing, really enjoyed it.
Legit pro work with great characters in a killer setting, and an earworm. I wouldn't discount a Grammy.
The rap was entertaining and as usual the cinematography and editing were fantastic.
You guys must have smoked the best cannabis in Nippon.
A S O So much volcano  NO VOLCANO ♪
When you’re flying over the Aso Farm Village with the drone it reminds me of a bunch of piggy banks.
What music app did you use?
Should have had Garnt on this episode
I just going to be here studying all day and singing this ridiculously catchy rap  🌋
Pretty OK :D
Too much volcano is when you’ve had too much hot sauce and it comes spewing out the next day. Oh ya, enjoyed the rap.
How awesome, from ‘cycle bicycle’ to ‘to much volcano’, time pressure suits you. Think there should be an journey across Japan compilation album!
BEst rap video ever
The rap was pretty nice !!!! impressed
Hahahahaha
The rap song good , I like it
Natsuki’s bars hotter than his uncle town’s volcano
This makes me wanna visit
Honestly, I hope Chris doesn't push Natsuki to do things he's uncomfortable with. There's a bit of a difference in how he acts in the old videos versus how he acts now.  Chris, if you read this don't get the wrong idea. I'm not suggesting that you are exploiting him. It's just that your massive audience could be pressuring him to act like he normally wouldn't. A million people watching is a heavy psychological toll for anyone.
Whats the app?
Damn, a real life star wars bunker
This video made me smile the whole time while watching it.
Check natske for copd and obstructive sleep apnea. With his history of smoking.
That Rap Video has higher production Value than actual rap videos from other so called artist. Good Job Chris!
not goning to lie song is pretty sick. would buy.
when's the radio edit for 'Too much Volcano' coming out?
That rap was amazing XD !!!
Best series so far very entertaining, really funny and I can still enjoy Japan's scenery...keep it up guys, you are doing great!!!!
Aso
ASO is dog in filipino. hahahaha
Good episode.  Made me smile
So this is the sequal
I had to pause after "Tabaccotage" because I was just laughing so much I was CRYING 😂  This was one of the best challenges ever, guys. You did that. Iconic. 👏🏼
That needs its own video release, I'd definitely play, people would be confused as hell.  However, Chris certainly ducked the performance side, huh?
I'm proud of you all...I'm such a wierdo...I do love and respect how far you all of gone in the last year plus.
Please Chris let me sleep, it’s 12:30 am,  i need sleep. stop posting good videos that I keep missing until I go to bed.
@MoriCalliope .
Love the Howie scream . Gotta be done
A S O Too much volcano   Next verse -  A S O  No volcano
Thats actually really good! Very impressive!
Too much volcano was writing the billboards. Great job 👏
Played it again, and laughed just as hard the second time. You guys have some great chemistry, and I'm so looking forward to the rest of the journey.
You had me at "so much volcano"  HOT
Well, you can see the reason these are getting spaced out. Excellent content & production. Great to see you’re having fun on this trip.
As always high quality
That was honestly really catchy.   Peak YouTube content right here.
This was freakin awesome.  Definitely put a smile on my face!  Great work and episode.  The rap was not bad!  Could've been a lot worse lol
Too Much Volcano, the part with ASO gave me the same vibe of Pen Pineapple Apple Pen.
Paris style... seems like natuki is transforming into an Englishman
Look out BTS - Joey and Natsuki are coming for you!
That rap song was actually epic. Joey's lines were so smooth!
Too Much Volcano is the genius feel good hit of the summer
My family enjoyed the rap thoroughly.   We would  like to  go on a  TOUR guided by all 3 of you across Japan ....
Love the content you make on YouTube to get me thru my difficult time. You trio make a similar chemistry with the trio from The Ganrd Tour.
Better then 80% of the rap songs that come out today tbh
Budget Sidemen Japan edition, I love it.
They took this silly challenges more seriously that I take my future.
wow, chris actually can beatbox, thats dope
The houses look like they came out of dragon ball Z
That Joey guy can rap, he should collab with my fav underground Japanese rapper Ikurru
Those done shaped hotel rooms look like houses in dragon ball z
You guys did a great job with using the elements of what was around you in the music video, love the lighting in the Hot Springs plus the dancing near the Valcano. The song turned out pretty good. Love the Beats in the background.   Chris please teach us how to Beat Box. ❤️
Fantastic video and great song!  I hate rap but loved that song.  Well done!
And as filming finishes on the final day, I think we can safely say... that's a rap.
Move aside BTS, the Journey Across Japan boys are coming to take your crown
What are you talking about that rap was pretty awesome
enter at your own risk....love you  Natsuki!
Amazing video and a really enjoyable rap song! Love the series
Ayo you gotta release “A-S-O too much Volcano” on Spotify!!!😂♥️
Did natsuki find his pants?
I love that Old School 1960's Era Looking Ferry Liner !..............Love Old School Ships and Railroad Equipment !...............Good Work as always Guys !............Oh do another Ghost Hunt but, with Ryotoro added into the gang getting the crap scared out of him !
Aso Natsuki - Too Much Volcano ft. Doctor Jelly
Great Vid Boys.
1:26 No you spunk up じじぃ! 🤪
Too much volcano better go on Spotify or I'm rioting
Not gonna lie the song is flame 🔥
Amazing filming and editing quality,and the song was good..
A S O... stinky volcano :D
Yesss Joey and Chris share a room, The best moments on this channel is when they take a bath together! <3
Best english speaking japan youtuber volcano x onsen rap of 2021 so far!  I like pizza! Extra salami!
3 guys in the hot tub 5 feet apart cuz they’re not gae
Not gonna lie, the rap song is so catchy lol
This is how you cure depression
Journey Across Japan really do be carrying June!
Goku lives in one of those.
How do you get the aerial footage?
Nice work boys!  A  S  O....now I got too much volcano on my mind....gonna play it while shabbing soon.
We need Ryotaro saying how Kumamon contribute to the local economy again
Too much volcano, Supreme creation, subarashii
They should have hired Aki and Sharla for the rap video xD
The song is so good, that I can't get it out of my head. I would like to see a separate release on spotify.
Love it😂😂
haha..love the 80s vibe in the rap song. well done boyz
Wait, the track is genuinely good, lads! So when will it come to spotify again?
ngl, kinda slaps
amazing rap guys!
Know fact aso is philippine word for dog just sharing
start 8:17 beautiful drone footage!
Excellent quality content as always and One of the best songs ever made👍👍 Nippon trio is the best🙌
LMAO 🤣 that rap song was awesome.  Very well done
Rap sounds campy as hell, but hey, it's got its charm!
fire volcano . loved the rap
When the transition to the song started i got a commercial for fried chicken, and for a moment i thought chris got sponsored by kfc.
Complainers....waaa...aa...aah.....hah
Why does Joey immediately get into the bath?
Awww Chris was so happy to treat Natsuki to a luxury onsen... ✨ 😉
That rap was a high key banger, 10/10 too much volcano
Journey across Japan: Excuse to get in the bath with Joey
I've sent this video with the rap song timestamped to multiple friends without context. 😆 I've watched it a few times myself I smile the whole time
I guess natsuki chris and joey went minecraft multiplayer within a single house
The raptor (hawk or eagle) when you were on the way to Mt Aso, was it legit? Damn the way it entered the scene in the sky while your van travels om the road, plus the scenery was legendary!!
legends
Chris, if you were ever turned into a literal, actual pig, would you be a responsible pig?
Hilarious 😆😆
i love so too much walcano
That made my day 🤣🤣🤣
Natsuki killed that hook tho
I’d love a top gear Japan with Chris, Joey and natsuki or even the three trash taste boys
@Chris You should release the video as it's own video on this channel.
i love this
That Cinematography * _ *
Bloody amazing
'Too much volcano' has no business going that hard
Natsuki will certainly give Eminem a run for his money.
That was actually pretty good for your lack of time, well done!
This rap slaps.
You guys have so much fun! More Adventure!
Reminds me of gangnamstyle
"A S O so much volcano" Abroad in japan filler
Something nice  An other great episode❣️
They knew you were coming...the British under the guise of a YouTuber and hid away.
Rocked that challenge guys. That song has staying power. It may be possible to have too much volcano but never to much AIJ. Love the series and the channel is super fly.
Bloody brilliant!....😁 Hope we see more hit songs in other episodes...😉👍
thanks for the video! so much vulcano! my day was brighten!
this is an amazing series
Aperture MC what?
That was a good and fun video!!!!
Ohhh I loved this so much❣️❣️❣️
I loved the rap song very chill. Also that black tatami mat looks cool I might want to buy a set of 4 for my bedroom
"say something nice" Hard to say anything bad that was fun lol
Damn boi this refreshed my memory of Dr jelly
Even if you had a whole day to do that do you guys still did a good job
The rap video could've used some bling, maybe natsuki holding japanese currency in the shape of a fan, while in the hot bath!!! Just a suggestion guys, still I really liked the composition!!!
The song actually be slapping🔥🔥🔥🔥
I love the effort and production put into these videos. Amazing quality content!!
Love the tub.
Hope you remember to "never come Korea, you Japanese spy man"
More adventures  so much volcano
Some of the challenges are eat the worst food Meanwhile on joeys channel: eating insect ramen
A-S-O! Too much Volcano! 🎶
I need my chicken
i love how an ad started playing instead of the song :)
Journey across Japan. Always fuckin' place. Why me?!
"Too much volcano...No volcano" Never since Alanis Morrisette's "Ironic" has there been a better pairing of lyrics.
Natsuki: "LET'S GO!" ME: "YESSSS! The real legend! Who the hell is DaBaby?"😂😂😂
What an episode! Every adventure seems to bring a new song, can't wait for the album! 😂
Cant believe natsuki had ptsd from the waterfall xD
Good job on the challenge. I really enjoyed the song.
A S O Too much volcano
Joey's dancing is burned in my memory now, I cannot see him the same way again lol
Ok seriously can anyone tell me the name of this hotel??? I want to look it up so badly but it's hard to find, there's a lot of them in this area
Ready set go... my entertainment for the next 25 min.
when's this coming out on Spotify
Came here looking for broads in Japan. Instead I found Natsuki in a bath. Not disappointed
23:07 I love the way Natsuki's "Extra Salami" gets a 2-beat extension. That's how much salami we're talkin'
Just a reminder Chris, you owe Natsuki a pair of pirate pants 😉
I enjoy watching JAJ from Darwin Australia 🇦🇺
Chris: "Why does no one stay at these igloos?"  Everyone later: "the beds were short and hard and the shower/tub was small." I think you answered your own question.
The rap wasn't that bad.
Sounds like a educational song that school teachers invent to help the kids learn
Where is that moustache guy's comment... Weird
Joey did a great job on that rap
I deeply appreciate the level of production that went into the rap portion of this.... Damn. We don't deserve this.
Does anyone know the song being played in the background at around 14:00? Sounds so familiar
Damn, I never thought Joey and Natsuki can come out to be this cool.
Is it me or Chris is getting fat again?
i don't know..but i feel fresh prince vibe
ENCORE! BRAVO!
I already know that the A-S-O chorus is going to get stuck in my head. Lol
*Extra Salami*
If 'A-S-O Too Much Volcano'  doesn't win a Grammy next year, then you know it is rigged. Just like Oscars.
When Chris pushed Natsuki towards the bath, you could hear the PTSD in his voice. Poor guy is gonna be afraid of standing next to water for the rest of his life.
I saw the video on how the igloos were made, I want one.
Needs more cow bell
Didn't you read the right column of that volcano warning table? Yellow means get outta there! Now that I think of it... you likely just ignored it. Taking the risk to make the rap video.
They really just dropped the hottest track and music video of 2021
The best documentary/guide I've seen lol
Abroad jumping on the weird trends bandwagon of cheap vs expensive, come on dog.
#AbroadInJapan does Chris and natsuki ever fight? If yes, about what? From Chris’ body language, it’s so obvious they share a very deep bond and friendship.
DAAAAAAAAMN THAT RAP SONG WAS GOOOODDDD
1. I really want to know what exactly it is that Chris' pockets are always SO jam packed full of.  2. I want to know which 80s song has been played so many times that it's resulted in that iconic 80s head dance Chris did. Is is Flock of Seagals? Depeche Mode? Rick Astley? This 80s baby would love to know! 😁😎☺
That rap video had me cracking up - hilarious! 🤣
ngl that rap song slaps 🔥
Man I wish I got to travel that country as much as you guys do, that rap song was 🔥 Joey
I'd put it on a Playlist to be honest..props on the time limit guys thats hard to do
Epic rap song! Old school rap is the best rap.
Loooooved it!! So entertaining you three are...Natski is so funny....so so good Chris ..cant wait for the next video!!
A S O
Richard Tolson, you are an absolute Legend! Thank you for placing that challange! 🤣🤣
You’re filming is so good Chris!
Something nice.
Bruh that song was a masterpiece 😂
LSS to natsuki's A-S-O too much volcano. 🌋
actually impressed by the rap...
Love the video and such a catchy rap song :D
Not enough volcano. Great rap though!
ASO NO VOLCANO
Chris Broad is cheap.
This was fucking gold!! Put this song on Spotify!!!!!
I actually like the no more volcano song
Best rap ever
That rap was inspiring and a treasure. I'll be repeating A-S-O while showering for weeks.
I loved the rap. Joey is very talented, it was catchy and funny. Natsuki is always hilarious. Chris did a good job helping put it all together.
Honestly that Igloo wouldn't be so bad if there was a touristic attractions around it, like legoland for example.
Risottero: " Kumomonga daiskidesu . Kumomonga tsugoyidesu"
0:55 The J-team assembles!  14:10 Having channeled the power of Aso, he wins it big!  21:15 Having channeled the power of fri- I mean trash taste and abroad in Japan, he 🔥!
Your channel really makes me envious of going to onsens! Huhu can they accept solo traveler?
Bucket list : get a haircut from Natsuki and have drinks with him
Chris was right... I never knew I needed this
Certified LSS!  A-S-O So much volcano
not enough cow bell
Well, I'll have that chorus stuck in my head all week. Natsuki's the true star
A - S - O too much volcano ... Can't get that out of my head thank you.
For the short amount of time u have put something great together! Its all about making memories! This will be a great series^^
Now I know where Akira Toriyama got his inspiration for houses in Dragon ball
Considering the time limit, wasn’t a bad rap song at all.
Amazing rap but would have been better with Garnt the rap god.
Billboard top 100 haha great job guys
That volcanic desert really does look alien. Amazing, as Natsuki would say.  And yes, I have to say I was really expecting to feel the second-hand embarrassment at the rap, but it really wasn't half bad. Nice job :)
You guys did a pretty good job for such a short amount of time - well done!
Awesome rap song. Make a song for each episode 😁
I've always thought that natsuki's last name was a car brand. Never actually thought it was dog all along.
The only rap song I  can listen to without getting angry at life people and essence of existence.
Dang, I'm sure a certain death rapping reaper would be proud of this.
Put Too much volcano on Spotify, please
Drop the Mixtape !!💿 🔥
That was awesome!
5:29 I think that last curtain sound effect was a second too late hahaha!  Great detail though :3
So2 turns to acid when it hits your mucous membranes. fun stuff
It's was awesome rap but I thought he said "no volcano bull volcano no volcano " lol
Fun episode. Looking forwards to the next one
Can we talk about the Wilhelm scream at 22:55 ? Lolol
Best Trash Taste special so far
Chris "how much volcano?" Natsuki "so much volcano." Me "needs more volcano."
*NO MORE VOLCANO*
3:34 ザ　フリントストーン???
Natsuki's room is one of the best looking hotel room that i ever saw
You are gay, no offend but time for ...
Sexy Elon musk
The production quality of that rap was VOLCANO!!!
Who else wants to see Too Much Volcano on spotify? XD
I haven't watched you for 3 years, dude you've made your Japanese friend fat wtf!
Why allways money? Hope one Day its about culture
There's too much volcano but also no volcano at all
I love it that was hilarious so perfect!
Joey is quite talented!
#2muchvolcano #novolcano
Okay that rap is kinda bop tho
Can I just comment how wholesome Chris and Natsuki were when he toured Natsuki's private accommodations? I feel like Natsuki deserves this holiday for his hard work, and I'm glad he's with some of his best mates on this journey. I can't wait for the Aso region to get a boom in tourism after that rap music video.
That was absolutely fantastic !!! You can tell you guys had a lot of fun 😁😁😁
That was a highly entertaining rap guys 👍😁
please tell me every episode will have natsuki taking a bath
Dragonball capsule house vibes
Actually ASO sounds so good!!! awesome beat and lyrics! Keep doing the good work guys!! Best video ever!
its coming home?
Now that was a great song and Chris on DJ was good
Grandmaster ASO
Ohmygoodness this rap completely annihilated me. So good. Please let me download as my ringtone! 🤯🙌🏼
Pls go universal studios with natsuki
This song will forever be stuck in my head.
The rap is funny and catchy! Me and my bf laughed so hard throughout the video👍😁
Natsuki: *raps*  Drake: This is a avengers level threat!
Weirdest part is that....is it good. It is a good song
I'm sure Eminem will be proud of your rap 😍😍.....A.S.O volcano
The song is quite catchy and it sounds from the 80s.
Wait shabbing or shagging? 😳😂🤣
Omg…”Too Much Volcano” is solid gold. That shit can cure anything! 👌
the rap reminds me of supermega a lot
A S O TOO MUCH VOLCANO
Too Much Volcano is too much awesome!
That rap was awesome. Catchy lyrics and fun people in it. Brightens the day after hearing it. Wish Covid would end with it. Have a nice trip Abroad in Japan. Hope to see you again in the next vid.
The BEST & FUNNIEST rap video!! Well done boys! 🤣🤣🙌🙌👌👌
I've been waiting for the next episode the whole week and it was awesome. The editing was too good, I love the views per location.   Is the whole series being edited by Chris only? If it is, Chris, you are insanely good O_O the dedication per episode in just wow. Joey and Natsuki is just super entertaining and I love it.   The Rap song was so good for a 9 hr production  A-S-O so much Volcano! XD  Can't wait for the next episode!
Well done guys, well done. 👏  Now how do I get "A S O, too much Volcano" out of my head?
This is quality content, here before this in the millions of views
thanks for my new ringtone!
Not bad, I'm just not in to rap but it sounds better than a lot of rap I heard besides it being more funny than good It's not that bad.
Sick !! Also how much is "too much" volcano ?
Mount Aso, you a**hole 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Actually the best song.
What does ASO stand for/mean? Pls help
If this is not on Spotify, I'm gonna be pissed
The rap song  "Too much volcano 🌋 "  in  Top  💯   world wide songs.😂👍
I love how excited Natsuki is to just be there
That song was awesome x'D
I give the rap song 2 thumbs up.  Mostly because you  look like you are having so much fun. I had no idea that Japan has such beautiful places.  The onsen looks incredible.
That was actually nice haha
Honestly a pretty dang good rap to complete within 9 hours. Great job guys. As always, loving the unique look around these different places in Japan.
it kinda funny how aso here means dog
That music video was amazing. I love the scene where Natsuki is waving his hands around  the rock like he's gonna tell the future
This is the best thing I didn’t know I needed.
that rap was hot fire, spewing (too much) volcano hot fire if you ask me
good jam
Loving the longer videos!!
I thought I'd have to take my headphones out for the rap, but it was surprisingly not that bad XD <3
Need more volcano
This is quality content there’s nothing like abroad in Japan I look forward to your videos the most 😭
And my best Nigel thornberry voice smashing
I heard watching the hot tub scene for too long has made people pregnant. Proceed with caution.
I wish I could like this twice, once for the video, and another for the rap song.
IGLOO hotel reminds me of the creepy village in Japan Sinks where they took refuge from the earthquakes O_O   also Joey's killing it with the lyrics :)))  im adding that private bath inn to my to go tho <3
Which hotel was the one at Kurokawa Onsen?
Those houses remind me of capsule corp houses. If Toriyama buys it he can rebrand it as a Capsule Corp housing. 😂
Loved the rap song!  Better than I could have ever imagined you'd think up in such short time. Excellent work boys.
the igloos look like where Luke Skywalker grew up lol
21:27 me in the tub imagining saving the school from terrorists
Is there like a Journey Across Japan OST? I'd like to listen to the music on my own adventures, as well!
If that's Japan and if it's only $100, then that's pretty decent for Japanese hotel accommodations.
WALK THIS WAY TALK THIS WAY CAR THIS WAY -Natsuki Aso My new motto!!
The aso village definitely looks like a episode from dragon ball z
Who is down voting these? Literally one of the best channels on YouTube.  🤨👌
I want to hide in that bath cave.
Man I love that dome village it's so cool
Aso Farm Village is Japanese Hobbiton
WOW! Really good job on the rap Chris! I loved your verse :)
We need a seperate video for the rap song cmon!!!
The rap song was hilarious 🤣🤣🤣 "extra salami" sell it to me
Please upload So much Volcano on Spotify 🌋
Can I purchase all of Journey Across Japan somewhere?
where is the spotify link?
wtf Chris can beatbox?!?!
Y’all have to put that on Spotify!!
A - S - O - So Much Volcano~  This rap's popularity is sure to erupt!
You guys the best.. 👍
this is better than most TV shows 💯
Ngl that rap was hard af and will be stuck in my head for weeks 😂👌💯
Not gonna like the song pretty good 👌 "aso too much  Volcano "
Great content bro
Thanks for making my Sunday nights less depressing! I love your channel and you guys are funny as hell together!
LOL NATSKI IS SO FUNNY !!
This video was fuquin' lit boiz.
Too much volcano 🤣🤣🤣🤣 i thought it was a success.
Chris please put release too much volcano. This song needs to hit the billboard charts.
This is an amazing series. Thank you!!!
This is the music video that will get 100 million views
That rap was something I definitely didn't know I needed. Where's the Spotify link?
Chris, you look good. Have you been working out?
cant stop laughing at the fact that there are 3 grown men (4 if including the cameraman) at the average age of somewhere around 30 dancing at the middle of nowhere doing rap dances around a "dinosaur capsule"
If we cpunt in the fact that this song was made in a day and the lyrics were forced to be pretty random, the song is really amazing. Can't say that I would go out my way to listen it again, but it was fun.
So much better then I expected!!! Awesome job guys !
I’m assuming the volcano smelled like the most concentrated farts and rotten eggs all in one.
IT'S SO GOOD
When is the song gonna hit spotify lol Love the vids keep them coming.
8:10 "When you make it big in life, this is where you end up". I don't know how he says that with a straight face
Ask Elon to come along next time
EXTRA SALAMI
So much fun watching your videos, love the filming, so profesh.
I thought you guys were mad but that was genuinely a good song.
Anyone else become the Leo meme when the igloo village popped up?
JAJ is by far the best travel series in all of youtube. U can't change my mind
HAHAHAHA. To quote Magneto: ... PERFECTION!
Amazing music video🤯 But what's the deal with the shorts in the Onsen😱
Fantastic rap! You guys look like your having a lot of fun!
Abroad in Japan really out here not telling us what app he made those sick beats on was called.
If this song doesn't top Oricon charts I'm gonna be disappointed
The thumbnail lowkey convinced me Chris watches the Sidemen, Maybe?
Lovely old job! Me and the lady smashed to the song, good show
This episode is just the behind the scenes of this rap
Love the Monday uploads Chris. Same time I can watch Sidemen Sunday here in Australia
12:40 lmao
Wow dbz was definitely inspired from this
Me: this is a really catchy rap Chris: *inserts Wilhelm scream* Me: … THIS IS A FREAKING MASTERPIECE!! ❤️😂
Need more volcano.
Natsuki looking down : what is this ? are they subtitle ?
Not sure why Rap video didn't make it into the title on this one.  Its a shining highlight.
We know what happens when there's too much volcano, but what happens when there just isn't enough volcano?
Too Much Volcano 22:55
10:44 forbidden for those with asthma?! damn it, i want to visit the crater!
ok the rap song is catchy XD
Chris: Sorry if the rap is shit. We made it in just nine hours. Drops this track that's hotter than the magma in the volcanoes.
Oh my God the rap was decent.
My favorite part 22:55
That Wilhelm scream was bloody perfect!
The rap was realy good but Joey needs a haircut.
gonna get NO VOLCANO tatted across my knuckles
Chris!! You put so much work into your videos! Thank you for always making them so wonderful for us to watch!! I love your personality!!!
very very sexy ( especially…)
Great job ...we absolutely loved the rap song ! So catchy !! 🗻🌋
ASO Too much volcano 🎶🎶🎶🎶
The Wilhelm scream was a nice touch
I laughed way too loud at that first shot of joeys face 21:28 I feel like Aki probably had a good laugh at that too 😂😂
That was absolutely EPIC!!!!! Great job all of you and so far, JAJ3 is turning out fire!
The UK, Japanese, and Australian rap scene has been quiet since too much volcano dropped
There’s a 4th person helping film correct? I’m concerned about where they slept in the stucco egg village. This was great again, just so much fun to watch.
16:17 Does anyone know who is the artist of the drawing on Joey's sweater? Looks so elegant!
The houses just look like dragonball capsule homes
I love how natsuki danced unironically
love how Natsuki pulls out aerosmith
Holy crap that rap song is way too good lol
That was very cool.  Please do another rap.
ヒスってる (hissuteru) - being hysteric  ぐぐる - (guguru) - to google  Now natsuki has invented しゃぶる (shaburu) - to shabu shabu xD
23:16 im dying
🤩great rap video. And it's really nice to see Natsuki having a good time. Great job Chris👍
That was a piece of art
That rap song is pretty catchy
This rap is unironically fire
eminem is scared of natsuki now i bet
Truly the biggest bop of our generation
So much Volcano is fucking awesome! i love it, ha ha ha! Great, great video!
Master class!
A. S. O  TO MUCH VOLCANO!!
Always enjoy your adventures!!!Great video
you should be proud of yourselves guys. the rap was beautiful. time to do a new series, "rapping across japan?"  (almost missed the extra p in rapping there... would have been akward)
quite surprising chris can beatbox considering his status as an old british geezer
Not going to lie, that Rap song kinda slaps.
Considering it was only 9hrs, joey did really well
Spotify, when???
YELLOW LEVEL ( 10:34 ) Description: A warning tofor those with health problems. Otherwise visit with caution. What to do: EVACUATE IMMEDIATELY 🤣
The only rap group The Reaper was too afraid to diss?  ...nah doesn't really work, but I had to get it in there somehow.
I loved the rap video haha so catchy and entertaining!
Can anyone hook me up with a link to this beautiful inn? I tried looking up Kurokawa onsen, and ryokan, but I was not able to find a place with these exact beautiful rooms 😭
That’s one smooth shabbing
Yo when this track gon be hitting spotify
A S O!
eminem has been real quiet since this dropped
unironicly slaps
That's like 3 challenges' worth of effort Made my day loll gj
You know it's great when there are Natsuki-isms (Shabbing☺) and when 20+ minutes feels like 5 or 6... ♥  Walk this way... Talk this way... Car this way... LET'S GO...!
Natsuki was so unsure when he said i...like... hiking !
okay but why does it go kinda hard though ???
The aso farm village looks like place that Goku went in the first dragon ball anime
Videos with Natsuki make my day better every time.
I absolutely love the channel and series! Now I know it will be released every Sunday (Monday for me), I am as excited every week for a new episode as I am with Loki!
Guys, GREAT JOB!!!! So much props for this music video. Keep in mind, you did this is like 6 hours... IMagine what you guys could do in a handful of weeks. CRAZY... Abroad in Japan Sound Track to remember each leg of the Journey... That would be a cool album... hahaha Again, great job!!! #TOOMUCHVOLCANO
hope Too Much Volcano is a new sound bit for the podcast!
Well done sirs! You know you have a good song when it becomes an ear worm and gets stuck in your head. Over and over...-👂👍
$100 igloo hotel  Vs  $1000 Onsen  Who will win?
Good job bios sounds amazing 👏 too much volcano 🌋
This song is this summer’s Despacito!
The single greatest song ever created! The rap song I didn't know I needed in my life! I will never be the same! Thank you for unleashing this masterpiece upon the world!
That song was so catchy it's going to be stuck in my head now...😆
As a Canadian, I approve the igloo houses. Not gonna lie, I wouldn't mind living in one of those if I were to live alone XD
Wait is it to much volcano or no volcano? I does has to be knowing.
Someone call up Calli and tell her she has some competition.
Too much volcano best rap video I seen in a while! Another great video guys!!
Omg the music video was perfect!! Lol
Straight heat🔥🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
best thing i have seen all month
The rap is so good that it rivals Dr. Jelly
Those igloos looked like a unicorn puked on Hobbiton. XD The rap was amazing, thank you for that beautiful work of art guys!
What a cute video! Well done.
Well done Chris, Natsuki and Joey! Thoroughly enjoyed this video!
good stuff love you guys
okay ngl, Too Much Volcano is a total banger? 10/10 would enjoy it on spotify, haha!
Too fun video.
This is so perfect! Great job and nice job!
Can I get this song on spotify?! 😂 You made my week, guys!!!
That was quite possibly the best rap song ever made. The shabu shabu part made me laugh to tears. Really enjoyed this episode! That onsen looked incredible. Looking forward to Abroad on a Horse! 😆🙌🏻
I loved this video so much and really liked the rap video
Good job chris. You’ve managed to create a comically legendary YouTube channel. It’s among the top channels in my opinion. Keep creating more epic content. Also the rap song was well done. I’d like to set it as my ringtone actually. Good job guys.
That's a pretty good rap song!! Loved it!
One hour later...   A S O  SO MUCH VOLCANO.  It's catchy.. I'll give you guys that.
305 loving it
This is hilarious!💕
A S O
🎶 *A - S - O so much volcano!* 🎶
phenomenal
BRAVO to JOEY …. I usually want Natsuki to do all the singing…. But you sounded AWESOME!  Natsuki… as always…. superb. 😒and then there is Mr. Broad. CHRIS!!!! Your beatbox would’ve & dance moves would’ve made this song PERFECT!😊 Loved the episode! Can’t wait for the horse episode❤️❤️
Please tell me this is being released on Spotify / iTunes music
Eminem has been oddly quiet ever since this dropped
A+ on the rap!
You should release the audio tracks individually so people can remix Too Much Volcano
As always you make these bleak times so much better. Most of the time I want to jump into the video for the fun. Thanks for bringing us along for the ride Chris. Keep up the amazing work. A.S.O Too much Volcano!!
Actually caught myself singing to the rap  XD
That was awesome A S O!
that song was a BOP! loved it especially the  "i like pizza- EXTRA SALAMI"
Too Much Volcano any explosive song with an unmistakable odor, but memorable tune.
Don't tell me Joey was tweaking !!!!!
Dbz dome houses fitting......
Its too much volcano / 10
Chris working in the Wilhelm scream, thus predicting people's initial reaction to the rap song.
Seeing you three guys adventuring together makes me smile :) great content as always man <3
Absolutely brilliant
For the time you had to make that MV, y'all did an incredible job.  The Village looks like someone built a factory far from town and just built a small cost effective village to house his work force during the week.
21:24 Let's go
The rap video was really awesome! I had a smile on my face from start to finish
Kinda cool, fun, and unique. 😎
You guys are making some of the best memories of your entire life! Never stop being goofy!!
You know that he's serious when he starts beatboxing
Don't usually like rap but well done.
Mori's been real quiet since this dropped.
Would honestly buy Too Much Volcano on itunes
No volcano 9/10 Chris should have been in the video. It's stuck in my head now.
Hmmm upload the song to Spotify? 😗
Not saying you should but 👀👀 i would have that rap video on loop if it was a seperate video 🤣 Like a music video
This week on Journey Across Japan, Joey crouches on more things behind Natsuki and Chris
I don't know about that song but those shots were amazing
Chris, Joey and Natsuki: goes to 3 volcanos    Music video: Too Much Volcano
Something nice.
That song was hilarious lol Great job guys, another excellent episode.
Natsuki looks so genuinely happy at 15:28 ♥️ it warmed my heart
Natsuki is clearly a star. Joey did pretty well on those verses but that hook is a chart topper.
This is peak content for sure.
Hell of a song! So much Volcano~
You guys did so well with that rap challenge! Super impressed with Joey's lyric writing skills! And now "ASO too much volcano" is stuck in my head.  Really good challenge as well from the dude who sent that in!
Great job guys. Looks like you're having lots of fun.
Is it just me, or does shabbing sound like shagging?
You should send the music video to the local tourism agency in Aso! Really good video and can't wait to see the next one with the horse and cave!
Epic.
I had fun watching abroad in Japan as usual. The rap was unexpectedly catchy!Had a good laugh at it! And I have to say The volcano did the boys good! Lol 😂
Lmao that rap was pretty good.
Natsuki you are too much volcano, no volcano and danger volcano all in one package. Meoww!
The one thing I love the most about this series it the Drone Shot, absolutely stunning.  Whoever responsible for those shots get a pat on the back, you did well.
I’m actually so surprised. Joey and Natauki did an amazing job with lyrics, and the cinematography is amazing. Honestly, the song slaps
Literal tears of mirth. Never getting that out of my head. Excellent work, lads!
Where did you get the little lights you used in the Onsen for the music video? They are very cool!
It was a really cute video. Excellent editing on it. You really make me regret my college major. "Have a major that will get you a lot of money." If I studied film I could have traveled across Japan and have a monetized YouTube channel. I'll leave the volcano adventures to you. I prefer the fake volcano we have in my town.
Well done guys!
Does the cameraman sleep in the street
currently 2021 in merica...
This intro never gets old
I thought the Rap was excellent.. not that I want to hear it again... 😄
Ohhh daaymmnn 🔥🔥😂
5:50 - Don't laugh at him. It may not be "spirits" or "ghosts" but the world does have an energy flow.
Haha that rap song was lit
I'm going to have this song stuck in my head. A S O so much volcano...
You should upload the rap to SoundCloud or iTunes as a hit single. XD
LMAO I loved the song! Job well done guys! And holy wow they allow people to just waltz around an active super volcano like...what could possibly go wrong with that idea x'D
i was amused by your too much volcano thing
I thought it was pretty impressive
Shit slaps
MP3 yesterday! Like Stat! No joke you guys! The was the best Travel Comedy Rap I have ever heard! ⭐
It really feels like watching a documentary TV show. I love the bird’s eye view so much!! With birds flying in the view too!!
Those are monolithic domes! I love it!
ASO  So much volcano  No volcano  No volcano Are there volcanos or not? 😂
ASO.... so much Volcano.......my new favourite rap song.......Well done you guys......
Well that was a challenge complete??
Can you please throw the song on Spotify?
I loved the rap
I love the journey across japan theme music
Full video on the second channel if anyone wants to loop it.
no  volcanoes is probably the best thing I've heard in 2021
"Too much volcano" is the new earworm for 2021🌋
A-S-O Too Much Volcano.  21:24 is why you're here.  This shit is so hot, Kanye stole Chris' Grammy.
Rap Song > Volcanic fumes.
Somehow the rap made me feel wholesome
What's the name of that place w yr own private onsen? Looks great!
I’d like to thank, on behalf of us all, the wonderful hero who submitted the rap as a challenge.
We better be getting "Too much volcano" 🌋 t-shirts. I am so ready
What an Aso! Lol
"Shabuhing with the homies"
Aso So much volcano
A S O. To much volcano.. In my head all day  Damm earworm.. 😊
TOO MUCH VOLCANO
I can’t wait for the future episodes. I hope you guys never stop this series, even if you run out of places in Japan, go international.
Natsuki got hosed on the rooms lol
Great rap fellas!  So happy Chris is still doing the "Journey Across Japan" series!!  Keep up the great work!
21:37 giving me very gangnam style opening feeling. A-S-O to much volcano!
A-S-O so much volcano haha so catchy. love it
legit someone has to bass boost the rap song; wanna hear natsuki's line reverb like crazyyyy (that beat was dopee)
Imagine having Connor, Natsuki, and Chris for Journey Across Japan. That is literally the monkes coming together.
i swear, the moment Chris said "we're staying at like igloo 57" - I just imagined some person out there whose going to visit Aso just to stay in that house for a twitter post @ing them.
You guys killed it! 🤣
Your cinematography is a thing to behold man.Thank you for sharing this awesome content and showing us around Japan!
Ngl the song is catchy. Good job with the series!
anyone knew what kind of shoe's natsuki is wearing?, thats fresh.
spotify when?
Loved the rap, its quite catchy! 😜
release the rap on Spotify/Apple Music
Nice rap video guys....oh and great yt vid.
I watched the ads for u for supplying me with the best rap I have ever listened to, also how do I make it my alarm
Rest of the album drops when...??
Producer Chris strikes again with a fantastic music video! Honestly loved all of this! It's impressive what you three were able to make in 9 hrs holy
The way Joey looked at the camera in the beginning of the rap video. 😂😂 <3
You guys really put effort into that rap video. Good stuff.
Great Show as always thanks Guys
Can we get a link to the Onsen you stayed at please?
Natsuki’s rap career is about to blow up……LIKE A VOLCANO!!!
Ngl Too Much Volcano slaps pretty hard
Awesome episode, really interested visiting and staying at that Aso Farm Village next. Also see the volcano next time I go to Japan. Can't wait for more episodes
I have a pen... I have an... * scratch * ASO... So much volcano...
Can you make a video updating the COVID situation in Japan and how it is affecting the tourism industry? I personally planned on visiting last year but now it looks like the plan is going to be on hold for a long time
Need too much volcano on spotify
I drove from Tokyo to Kumamoto in 12 hours lol
I really want to know what those 48 thumbs down are for man. Fun stuff!
Too much volcano.
Not gonna lie, with all that volcano I would also have too much volcano. Great song, thanks for the one who proposed this challenge.
Great Job Guys!!!!
Igloo village = Smurf village  Yes im that old 😑
The beginning looks like a cyberpunk movie.
Is Too Much Volcano coming to music streaming apps?
EXTRA SALAMIIIIII
If you know tenacious D's tribute this rap song is what they were refering to as "the greatest song in the world"
Loved episode 2 and the rap was....surprisingly good and catchy 😉😆😁
Knowing joey i thought he'd ask for help from your boi
Amazing series and even better rap
Three guys and a trip.
Oh my god yesss!!! That music video made my entire month thus far. Thank you so much for that :D
Eminem has been real quiet since this dropped
So when is this amazing rap gonna be on spotify so I can put it on repeat.
Chris can do beatbox, I-I didnt know
That song was most bussin
God damn I love this channel
Natsuki making bat sonar sounds in his mini cave lmao 🤣
LMFAOOO PLEASEE, That was so freaking awesome XD
That is shockingly good!
been waiting on this vid like a crack head.
Awesome music video😄☺️
Too much fun with “Too much Volcano”! Great job guys.
21:52 top ten artist eminiem was too scared to diss
Man, I need this song on my playlist on Spotify!
Whoever sent the challenge to make a rap song, thank you! lol That was awesome. Also, I was right that it's the same igloo village from before! The inn with the private baths look nice. It's cool how a lot of things were used in the music video... you guys put a lot of effort into it!
Reminds me a lot 80-90's RAP style... #IFeelOld
22:48 there the money shot
Natsuki's jumper has already predicted how the volcano hike is going to go for him... WHEEZE 🤣
nice!  hope it goes viral!
ASO's volcano has been real quiet since "Too much Volcano" dropped
Awesome Rap song!
Niiiiceee RAP
When he said "EXTRA SALAMI" i felt that
Awesome awesome awesome. Hats of to you chaps.
I enjoyed this video immensely... So much fun! Keep up the great work!
oh my goddd I want to go so bad, that inn looks beautiful! all your videos really show off japans pretty landscapes! I think we can forgive you for failing the first challenge since you absolutely went above and beyond completing this one!
I would very much like to see Mori Calliope's reaction to this rap 😂😂
thats like a dragon ball house
....extra salami!!! Oh my gawd, I love it!!!
....And the Grammy for Song of the Year goes to....  “Too Much Volcano” by Joey the Anime Man ft. Natsuki! Produced by Chris Broad!
I cant wait
You made up for your fishing skills.
I don't listen to a lot of rap but... that was pretty good!
I think you guys did an awesome job with the rap song! I always love the cinematography of the videos! Keep up the awesome work! 😊
Just found my new ringtone for 2021. Now all I need are friends to call me. #Toomuchvolcano
Maybe one day..I too can go shabbing in an onsen
Those shots outside the huts were hilarious. Gotta learn those dance moves now!
Shabu-shabu is good and all, but in Filipino, the word "Shabu" means "Meth."
I fucking love journey across japan.
Trying to find Natsuki’s channel to sub but I can’t find it 😔
That was awesomeeeeeeeeeeeee!!! ASOOO
Everyone is talking about the valcano song while what this song is 0:19
"Too much Volcano"- it just hits different.
As a  project for art class from high school I chose making a music video.  So, this did take me back.
Can we just have a show about natsuki already. He should be a Japan icon at this point imho
Love the Wilhelm scream in the instrumental. Haha.
Grammy!!!!!!!
I really liked that you boys got somewhere nice to stay. That onsen looked amazing.
That was the best music video I've ever seen in my life
Anyone know what shirt Joey is wearing around the 3:45 minute mark?
Music rap video success!
Natsuki's come a long way from "Cycle, Bicycle".
I never knew I needed a rap like this one!! Lol!! I love 💕 too much volcano 🌋
These are taking too long to come out. The videos are way to good team abroad!
Love it!! 😍Too much Volcano!
The rap song was great! Very funny lol
Yooo Joey's verses are lit af 🔥🔥
Song actually wasn't that bad.
Natsuki talking about hiking while wearing a hoodie that says "wheeze", irony isn't lost on me lol
@Abroad in Japan, Chris how did you guys get the keys when you arrived at the Igloos? I want to include this accommodation when my wife and i travel back to Japan. I am just afraid after i book one of these online, i would struggle to find where to get one of the keys
Are you going to release too much volcano as a single? I'm asking for a friend...
That verse was so catchy I can't get it out of my head
2:59 sus
Great episode, I'd love to visit a volcano and see that kind of desert. It takes talent to create a rap video like that in such a short amount of time. I'm not sure what kind of talent but definitely talent.
Damn, that's pretty good writing for something done in a mere 9 hours. Well directed too. Chris should appear, dancing and singing, next time as well though. I get that he's the director, but at least show us some moves Chris! xD
I always find myself talking in my generic American British accent after watch your videos😂
You put a Wilhelm scream into a rap video... take my like, you filthy scamps.
absolutely loved the rap!!!!!
"A.S.O Too much Volcano"
Something nice ;)
Can't decide if thee is too much volcano or no volcano.
That’s not a rap song! Lol it’s a 80s freestyle song. It’s actually good.... lol
Bro Bath
Me and the boys shabbing. That dosent sound weird at all
Make too much Volcano into it’s own video!
0:49  everything is not daijobu once again
The rap video was fun and for the short amount of time you had to come up with it is was well done!
This was a fun watch hahaha
0:49 animepain is back
When can we get the rap on Spotify and other music streaming services?
Song slaps I love it 😂😂😂
class
Too much volcano so much fun! This song has proven how talented each of you are! Great entertainment quality there! This song is on repeat !
dude that slapped
Wtf you can beatbox :o
The sheer musical talent
Oh my god O:-) fucking I  love abroad in Japan
I really hope that Aso farm village has more business on the other side of COVID. So much work has gone into it, it deserves to be appreciated more.
So those hot spring rooms cost $1000 a night per person? Woah.
I’d prefer if they did a rap like this at the end of each episode
so one of the only rap song i watshed til the end! of it! gj! lol
super fun!
That rap was amazing! You did a great job on it, it’s hilarious and really catchy!
Too much volcano is a great product. I bit confusing one the amount of volcano present in it from none to too much but well made fellows.  Greetings from Sammamish
Walk this way, Talk this way  , Kumamoto lets go
That rap song and video had a fantastic 80's vibe to it,,,,get the DeLorean Marty
Omg I went to kurokawa
Glad to see Natsuki is enjoying is vacation! Also the rap was . . . Interesting boys definitely entertaining however.
What an episode guys!!! I'm worried I will have that song in my head for a week :) ASO...
Well thats going to be stuck in my head for at least a week...
0:51 Kaneki Joey😂
Hahaha love it! Is the rap song available on Spotify?
LSS...grrr natsuki-san...so much volcano. hehehe
*Shabbing with the homies* 🤣
What's the name of the app you where playing around with?
Laughing in the lava 🤣
I am both disturbed and enchanted.
That rap is magnificent
I never knew Chris could beatbox this well damn
22:52 the Wilhelm scream was a nice touch
Chris beatbox is at gbb level
Oh god that song is gonna be stuck in my head for the next 2 days…. You should post the song as a separate video too! More views that way👀
brilliant rap music video with amazing crew! well done!
If anyone knows what lights Chris is using, hit me a link.
Random comment to help finance the next trip. ♥
Chris you should post that rap video separately, it's genuinely pretty dang good. Great considering that it was written in a single day.
That was actually pretty good rap for a “bad” rap!  I enjoyed it very much.
Why did I expect Joey to rhyme “black tatami” with “your mommy” lmao
I’m gonna need more songs from you guys
I must say the RAP was actually kinda good!
Lol. love the rap video. made my day.
The fresh prince of Aso
Ipod worthy!
Chris thanks for everything 🙏🙏🔥
Journey across Japan is the Top Gear of youtube.
The village houses reminds me of the capsule houses from dragonball z
@abroad in japan did u realy utilized the "wilhelm-scream" in the rap song? xD
The rap was acctually really good
We all know that the snoring was not the reason Natsuki got his room, they were ready for another 1000 years log onsen action
Genuinely amazing song! One of the best I've heard all year, definitely getting stuck in my head. Please please start a band!
Just like a literal volcano, they be spitting fire for the rap video 🔥
What was the amount of the volcano again?
Chris beatbox... Nice.👍
Will this rap be on spotify, it's a total jam
Epic
I can’t believe these contents are free. The intro of the mv was so cool😂fr tho
Rap song and rap video *chef's kiss*  lol only problem...I'm going to have the chorus stuck in my head all day hahaha
Ah yes, the obligatory Hot Springs episode.
Too much volcano, what a bop!
That was really good great job guys
Genius!! Loved it fellas!!
I loved Too Much Volcano! Sick Beat! Natsuki's lyrics really tied the whole thing together.
Something nice :)
Ye verily, what is elevated canines! Great vid as always!
RELEASE TOO MUCH VOLCANO ON SPOTIFY
i need a A-S-O too much volcano ringtone
The igloo place looks like a giant money loss
Niice. What took so long Chris! Just kidding, so excited, looking forward to watching this your new video.
*you gotta release ASO in iTunes Abroad in Japan~~!! **#underrated** **#volcano** **#sick** **#LIT*
nice rap song for the video
I agree too, too much volcano
Something nice. There you go I said something nice.
The place looks like a glorified internment camp, which is unique.
Holy, what a banger, was not ready for thi$ 🤑🤑
I got some serious Fresh Prince of Bel Air vibes from that rap. Loved it!
I came for Japan’s beauty 🇯🇵     and….. Stayed for the fire lyrics 🙏
That's going on my playlist very dope
Top 10 rappers Eminem is afraid to diss
Fakku shirt as always
Am I the only one who rocks out to the intro theme - every time?
Damm....! Joey can rap! (not one of my favorite genres though) This could be his audition tape should a vacancy in the Hilltop Hoods come up.
Mic drop
I love you all and this channel so much - good work Chris, Natsuki, and Joey!
Actually the rap is fantastic! !WEll done!
This song is Shabbin'!

This rap was soo legit  😂
That's actually pretty good rap song
Natsuki>Eminem
Great Rap!!!! OMG!!!
Not going to lie but that song is funky I love it
Top ten rappers who Eminem is afraid to challenge:1# Natsuki chris and the Australian joey
Genuinely surprised by the track. Actually good. Didn't know Chris made tracks like that.
it's finger licking good
Ah, that was horrible rap song. But, I love it when Natsuki saying a "Oh My God" word.
So…you’re putting this on iTunes right?
0:50 "everything is not daijoubu"
Whooo! New episode! Time to grab my popcorn 🍿
The song was truly a masterpiece
I'm never going to get this out of my head. From the opening to the dancing.
Joeys moves. Lol 😂
It’s 4am for me but screw it I need to see this
Joey never fails to be photogenic, at least... lol
Didn’t realize Samurai Champloo released a second season lol
I need a gif of Joey's dance!  Fantastic music video! So much volcano. 🥰
Great! Love it .
i love you guys
I was just thinking this ain't a bad rap song till I kept hearing "No Volcano! No Volcano!" lol
top 10 rappers that reaper scared to diss
Better than BTS.
I loved that rap song you guys made, you should make a separate video for it
No volcano
I love that all three of them pet the dinosaur capsule rock
ASO
God, what a blast to the past. I felt like I was back in my elementary science class
Your looking healthy dude. @5:39 👍🏻 Mabye because your showing more clean jawline
can't wait to see "A-S-O Too much Volcano" trending in the billboards soon
Seriously amazing. I tot I found the dome house familiar.
I hope the rap song will be ASOs national anthem from now on.  Anyways I had a good laugh.
SHABBIN!
That rap song and video clip was awesome, I had a smile on my face the whole time! Hehe well done fellas !
Top fucking quality, this channel
2:12 rewind button
Great job gents! Super entertaining and can’t want to watch more of your journeys across Japan!
Rap was good.
I actually like your song, catchy and made me smile. Anything that makes me smile right now is a plus in my books!   Enjoying the new installment of Journey Across Japan and looking forward to more!   Cheers from Ottawa Canada!
Song of the year boiiiss lmao
BEEN WAITING ALL WEEK FOR THIS!!
That rap vid is so gooood lol
Omg Chris, I was in Kumamoto in 2018 and I swear, that place IS a ghost town. I got off my bus, first thing i saw was a graveyard. Walked a lil bit, found my ryokan and the entire night i was the ONLY one walking around town. It was the same with the day time. I walked past a school and I saw cars parked out front but when I peeked, the classrooms were empty. It was surreal.
You need a name for your rap group, now that you've got two hit songs.
Currently experiencing ‘A-S-O Too much volcano’ LSS. 😆
I think I have just died laughing with “Too much vulcano” 🤣🤣🤣
#moreadventure
I really love these videos, and this series. It gives such a comfy vibe and makes me feel all warm inside.
😂😍🤩😆🥵🌋🌋🌋🌋🌋🔥🔥🥵
chris i love your channel so much.  i don’t have many friends and i feel like i’m part of the crew when i watch your videos.  it’s my dream one day to go to japan, thank you so much for showing us so much of the country.
That rap was a whole bop though
I can fuck with that! Its a Banger
Amazing rap bois
Phenomenal episode. These just keep getting better. That rap song is going to be stuck in my head a good while. Oh well! :D   A S O,  SO MUCH VOLCANO! -C’mon-No Volcano. No Volcano.  A S O,  TOO MUCH VOLCANO! Nowhere   Nowhere, OH MY GOD.  *boogies*
Lmao well done mate!
Sooo Good lolol 👏🏽
Ah, very nice. The only thing the rap shot was missing was the spinning yellow light every time the "too much volcano" lyric came up!
Been looking forward to this every week, thank you Chris
Posting to say something nice about the rap It was pp nice
Okay but why did you go so hard
that rap was simultaneously way worse and way better than i anticipated... i'm in awe and i'm gonna assume that's a good thing
I loved it. Great guys in 9 hours we need the apple down load and a name for the Duo maybe  ASO????
holy shit man, that inn is so beautiful. the chris really have the best japan vlog ever
You Should upload a completely seprate video of 'to much volcano' 🌋
Joey rockin the oompa loompa haircut.
Mate I fucking love your videos, dare I say it on par with Bourdains work. Thank you so much for all the knowledge and potential bucket list items!
when does it hit Spotify?! Thanks for the video, looking forward to the next episode. Keep up the great work, love the song :)
Shabbing with the bros sounds a bit lewd
Damn, I love this channel. I always rewatch JAJ on the smart TV just cause those shots deserves a bigger screen seriously. Glad I watched this in the morning, totally made my day. ❤
What’s the name of the ryokan? It looks amazing!
ETA for RAP Across Japan? :D
*A S O* *𝓣𝓸𝓸 𝓶𝓾𝓬𝓱 𝓿𝓸𝓵𝓬𝓪𝓷𝓸*
wow, i just realized that natsuki has grey hairs now...
Aloha! Thank you for taking us along! Never seen a hotel like that! Cool! Aloha!
natsuki sounds like captain falcon
Chris I have grown to love your videos and eagerly await every one, cant wait to get into this, im also a new patron! keep up the awesome content!
12:55 that looks really nice
best rap ever
Man I never commented 3 times on the same video without being in a fight.... BUT THIS IS AWESOME. I needed this in this shitty year.... .
Rap was fire
Joey, the moment he steps in a bathtub:  "ATSU!!"
Why can I only give this one thumbs up?! The video and the rap video each deserve their own separate thumbs up!
Daaaaaammmmnnnn Chris... You guy killed it. The way you shot that video was really impressive... Expect Post Malone to hit you up soon.
Am I the only person who's going to mention the Fakku merch
Great job, guys! The rap video... 😂 It was amazing. Natsuki saying "too much volcano" is going to be stuck in my head for a while 😂 you guys looked like you had a blast!
SO MUCH VOLCANO UwU
Enjoyed this tremendously and you guys made the coolest rap song ever! Amazing! ✨🙂👍🏻
As an actual music producer, Chris’s beat was really well done. Good work boys!
Chris where’s your verse? I’m expecting a Chris broad remix.
Chris should also be included in the MV.
Also where is Chris's verse??!?!
The video was great, but there was TOO MUCH VOLCANO!
MOAR VULCANO!
Also, that rap was pretty lit.
That was so cool hahaahaha
Best video so far for this JAJ don't take so long to upload!
Lol “ to much volcano was pretty funny
wait the rap song is actually decent?
Natsuki killed it! the beat is awful though, one of the worth I've heard in a while I'm sorry to say, and I've gotta be honest Joey can't rap to save his life
I was thinking about Linkin Park the other day and now you brought up rap.  Have you considered having an international celebrity on?  Give them a "Tour de Japan" when all of the lockdown restrictions are eased?
cds when?
Great music video!
The rap and music video is so much fun! 👏  Edit: best challenge yet. Many thanks to the guy who sent it in.
Honestly, that’s Spotify worthy.
impeccable camera work. In awe at the volcanic desert shots. It reminds me a lot of Death Stranding
Tbh this mv has a really great cinematic quality👍🏻
Chris: Calling Kurokawa onsen the most beautiful in Kyushu...   Angry Yufuin and all the other onsen of Kyushu noises...
I enjoyed the rap. Thank you.
those igloo houses remind me of the cult houses in Japan Sinks lol
You should upload it too Spotify
Chris, that beat you made on your phone was really nice 👍
This is better than Netflix
tabacottage sounds like a tobacco cottage cheese alternative.
Unironically a good time, great song!
love the song it´s so funny that its likeble
Mmmm Chris lookin yummier then usual. New haircut?  The rap wasnt bad btw.
chris is the most OP youtuber
Effective earworm!
Chris, please put the song on Spotify 🙏🏼
My mans too humble that rap was fire!! 💯
the best rap song I've ever heard
A-S-O! Too much volcano! WTH! It's so... so... catchy! XD I loved it! Hahahaha Also, that ryokan looked so nice D:
🔥🔥🔥🔥TOO MUCH VOLCANO🔥🔥🔥🔥
Expected just an okay rap to complete challenge but we got something banger instead
1st fake England and now the Shire. And then off to Mordor. Tricksy hobbitses!
NATSUKI SUBARU!
The song is going to my Spotify play list 👏🔥
i guess its safe to say the volcano they visited smelt like some one's dirty.......ASO?     yes its stupid, but it needed to be said.
When is aso too much volcano coming to Spotify 😎😂 (no joke I'll vibe with the song)
STRAIGHT BARS
Is Joey sponsored by fakku or what?
The song highly surpassed my expectations! I love the quality of JAJ so far! Amazing Chris. I hope that Natsuki enjoyed his holiday.
You guys are the highlight of my day. You always make me smile. I lived in Japan 22 years ago and I am inspired now to go back. ASOka.
Rap was so banging i just vibed while making protein shake
I'm not gonna lie Too Much Volcano is pretty darn catchy
Dislikes must be coming from Paris
No journey across Japan no party. Guys you are the best, I adore you
Thanks. I finally forgot why I was sad.
You guys always make me smile.  :)  Thank you for brightening my day just by being yourselves & having fun!  Also, the rap is 10/10.  Every part of it!  Well done, Chris, Joey, & Natsuki!
No kidding, a friend of mine lives in one of those dome houses in Shizuoka. He built it himself and went for the bigger, oval version. It's actually really cool. The song (and video) was better than some I've heard from people with recording contracts. And the lyrics were family-friendly, which is a rarity in that genre. I was in Kagoshima in 2018, and it's a lovely city. Being across the bay from Sakurajima was as close as I wanted to be to an active volcano. Turned down a friend's offer to visit the peak.
can i get the rap on spotify
Rap success!
Lovely video and an even better rap song in my opinion
My pants!
Hopefully, Norm got a room or did he have to sleep in the van?
"something nice"  :P
Can't wait to see the next episode
Just seeing you 3 adult men being happy and wholesome on this trip, that's already great content but the quality is amazing on this video I hope it does get more attention when people find it. Also I love how natsuki did the opposite of mumble rap, it made my day better lol thanks.
I like that boulder, thats a nice boulder. -Donkey
Having Natsuki along the series is dream come true. I hope at the end you have a lot of good memories and fun. Im looking forward to next episode !
Bro I can't believe you pulled this masterpiece off in 9 hours I could never pls do put it on spotify keep up the the good work don't hurt yourself by working to hard and stay safe.ps love the video it made my day:)
I can't believe my premonition of you making this a separate upload was correct way to capitalized on your original music and video concept.
So when is To Much Volcano coming to Spotify???
What in the Holy Hell did I just watch ? You can't unsee that lads.... well done for the time you had, bravo.
Interesting. Chris is left handed!
Mount Aso, where we go and search for Lady Kaso, so we throw our Lasso, to catch her in Aso🎶
i cant stop thinking about a dog every time “aso” is spoken
Great rap! It's always a treat to see Natsuki having a ton of fun and his English is pretty damn good now compared to your first few videos featuring him. Keep up the great work Chris, Joey, and Natsuki!
where does the camera person sleep?
I wish we had a rap video reaction video from Naysuki's wife.
Misty lenses would have been fun shooting those indoor Onsen scenes. Nice work.
Petition for a Natsuki rap album drop in 2022.
too much volcano slaps harder than strong lemon
Journey Across Japan isn't complete until Natsuki says "always fucking place"
Y'all better put Too Much Volcano on spotify so I can add it to my summer playlist
Ngl that song, low key, slaps 😂
i loved the rap song. need it on streaming services:)
When they started rapping in the onsen I got flashbacks to Japan Sinks 2020 and now I can't stop laughing
Too much volcano.... No, never enough volcano
ASO so much Volcano, fkna I’d by the soundtrack hahaha
that rap was fire 🔥
The best rap ever, because when you hear the famous rapper, you only listen in general bad words, the same ideas, nothing special but you guys makes me love rap
Imagine making a rap song and showing a mom's minivan as your fancy car
THE only rap song I Like... no! LOVE! Epic <3 would have to loved to see Chris dance as well.
Too much volcano added to the play list 💪🏽🔥
Loved the rap!
Love it! Great rap! Glad you're having some fun.
Why you look like Elon Musk?
There’s Lo-fi city sounds, Lo-fi camp, even Lo-fi rain. Now we have Lo-fi volcano.
never thought they'd be living among the land of the smurfs.
You guys are set for life.  "Produced, and featured in rap battle on top of an active volcano wasteland" on the job resume will get you anywhere.
That rap definitely had Fresh Prince vibes. I wouldn't have it any other way.
can we get that rap on Spotify!!
GIVE US A SEPARATE VIDEO OF TOO MUCH VOLCANO SO I JAM WITH MY HOMIES WITH IT
Too much volcano
It's a genuinely good rap!! My new jam 🎵👩‍🎤
we were watching the music video part, and looked over at our parrot (watching over our shoulder), who was dancing back and forth with excitement. if nothing else, it's a hit with the avian crowd (it was delightful)
A.S.O
"Aso" in our language means dog.
Good work with your song
You should put the music video up separate, just to see what it can do as a stand alone music video
Ahaha this is wholesome, love you guys
I’ve never once been able to find another person who used or knew about Novation’s Launchpad in my life. I’m so glad the first one I shared this hobby with was Chris lol
Thanks Chris. Your rap made me super happy and sad at the same time and I don't know what to feel anymore. <3
RELEASE THE DANC1NG MAN CUT! This was too good!
Pretty obvious what the outside hot spring "cave" is for…🍑🍆
Great song you guys made.
Why aren't there many people, did you seen parking? ; p
Best rap video I ever watched. XD
Finally a hot tub stream I would watch
This is wholesome
Guys, I know where I want to go before I die! Don't tell me you wouldn't stay in a earthquake resistant igloo! You're lying to yourself
Top of the charts in first 24 hours of release!!!!!! Chris, we see you've been working out with those buff arms!!!!! Great 📽️  as always!😎
joe just jumped in the bath tub right away lol
My son liked it so much.. it was decent but he loves it, wants it on a loop. Thanks gys
The song is actually catchy, it’s gonna be running in my head
That rap actually was decent! I loved it all. So much fun. I love the editing and everything.
Track is a straight up jam
LOVE THE SONG!!!! U GUYS NEED TO PUT IT ON SPOTIFYYYYY!!!!
TOO MUCH VOLCANO HELL YEAH
Natsuki looked epic in the beginning of the rap music video.
haha i loved the rap haha
No volcano , too much volcano . It is good song. you gotta upload it in separate video <3
Incredible rap song😆 it's beyond bescription! Joui is very good at singing rap songs♫ Good job👍
That looks like the igloos of dragon ball animation in reality and it’s really cool to live in 🐱❤️🌹.
I thought it was pretty good my self
I'm actually so impressed by the rap song. You all did so great with what you had, pat yourselves on the back 🥰 I think I'll have it stuck in my head for the rest of today 😂😂
Natsuki is 100% a gift to this channel and the world. Need an annual "Making Natsuki's Wildest Dreams Come True"  video.
I love how it ended up becoming a 90’s rap
chris needs to be IN the rap video
This is such an underrated channel
Well done, guys!!  Loved it. :)
Thought the rap video was absolutely awesome!!
Love this so much hahaha the rap at the end got me lmao
Something nice
Dear god
I love watching you merry band of guys just living
A.S.O SO MUCH VOLCANO! ⭐️
happy to see natsuki enjoying himself with his good friends & having a much deserved holiday.  <3  you were all stellar, thanks for sharing your talents & humor.  & thanks for the earworm "A-S-O too much volcano" on an endless loop in my brain!
A S O TOO MUCH VOLCANO
You guys are so fun to watch, I hope you guys make more content together, heck throw Ryataro in too. Seriously!
Wholesome content
Seriously, the rap transported me back to the 80s.  The most family-friendly and super accessible sound ever.
this was amazing!!!
new boy group bts is quaking
Better than Logan Paul's music
That editing at @2:40 was amazing! dude im loving the video upgrade!!! very impressed!
A-S-O! Too Much Volcano! No Volcano! Will legit be in my head for days now😂 Y'all all did a very good job👏!
Back up dancers in the making.
Honestly, it wasn't that bad. It had a nice beat and made me smile, so what more could you want?
I kinda like the rap
I love that you guys put the "Wilhelm Scream" in your rap video. That made it EPIC!!
reminds me of the houses in dragonball
That was... That sure was a song. I like it
rap was straight 🔥🔥🔥
Kurokawa!!!  Brings back so many memories!!
Great video.  Terrible music.  I love it!
Not a bad Rap song Boys. Pretty impressed!!
Kurokawa Onsen looks like an amazing place to visit. Definitely want to make an effort and visit there.  That rap definitely had influence from Chris with the 80s beat (I'm not calling you old Chris, we're not that dissimilar in age), but Joey feels like he's channelling the Sugar Hill Gang.
"Weird looking bathtub." You guys! That's like a traditional old school claw foot bathtub that thing just screams class.
This was fucking awesome
9:45.  Tricky tricky tricky
Im going to bed with the picture of Natsuki in red lights and the song stuck in my head. I wont be able to sleep, nor will my partner at this point...
I think the igloo houses are cool, very unusual. Love seeing places I'll never be able to go to. 👍
kay but "too much volcano" slaps though
I loved the rap song so good 😂👌🏻
Series so good that this 25 minutes felt like 10 minutes.
eyyy 😂😂🕺🕺🕺too much volcano
🥓Salami!
I'm not that much into rap but that was pretty good, and only in 9 hours from people that don't make music for a living is pretty impressive too
So I guessing I'm the only one that immediately thought of the Capsule Corp houses from Dragon Ball Z, when first seeing those igloo houses.
The Rap song is Awesommmmeee ! I love it. Seriously ... 9hours.. And you have a great result. You are all 3 very talented. 😍😍
It's not journey across Japan without Joey and Chris bathing together!
looking forward to Dr. Jelly!
I would buy a shirt that says "Too Much Volcano" with the exploding volcano on it. I WILL GIVE YOU MONEY FOR SUCH A THING. You all did awesome and what a beautiful area. And how come Chris didn't sing???
This rap video was better production quality than the Dr Jelly commercial! This was actually really well done guys. Great job with the challenge! :D
What a banger of a song. When's the Spotify debut?
If it’s one thing I hope, it’s to see the return of Dr.(Hand) Jelly! Loving the series!
spotify release when?
7:30.  Look for Cindy loo. Hoo. 🤣😂😳
dude, i can hear the pascal ost from nier whenever I see those weird igloo houses
Hearing the journey across japan theme just puts me in such a good mood
A-S-O too much volcano~  🎶  this is going to be stuck in my head for a while now📍
Rap Kings letssss goooo
Joey sounds a bit like will smith in prince of bell air in the rap song😂👍
I feel like joey didn't realize at the time that the song was actually kinda good
Jelly volcano? Now we wait for it to be on Spotify jokes aside, it was impressive considering the amount of time you guys had among other stuff that you had to do during the day. Great video as always you're all amazing
Please upload that song as a stand alone , that was some beautiful meme material right there
I listened to the song before this video, and it's still just as good :)
Is there too much volcano or no volcano's? i am very confused.
I looooooved "too much volcano"  😭☠😂 gave me so much joy oml
Natsuki: *sings* Eminem: why am i sweating?
Chris , This videos are just tooooo good .
Shit was fire, gonna need that on Spotify
The music video was not as bad as I thought it would be, I had a nice laugh today, Thanks for the entertainment!
Aso to much sexy
Dude, that was actually a very legitimately good Rap video in my random person opinion lol
can i come on a trip with u guys? I'm not very funny and I have shit hair so I'd fit right in x
Well, I've seen worse raps! 😂 a masterpiece in some ways!
I really love your Editing and Camera Work this was really fun to watch :D
A S O TOO MUCH VOLCANO
Spotify pls
Where did the cameraman sleep?
The production quality for that rap video was absolutely insane
You guys saw the challenge through to the end! I'm glad you ended up pulling such a fun request. Loving the videos and I'm looking forward to the next one!
Every video on this channel is so well made, you would really believe there's a whole network behind it. Thanks so much for all the hard work you put into your videos. I get so excited when i see a new upload.  you need to start making episodes 4hrs long haha
And the music video award for too much volcano goes to..... Journey Across Japan!
no volacn
THE RAP WAS SO GOOD THE HELL
Well, got a new location for my wish list of places to visit, and that rap is going to be stuck in my head for the next day or so.
Yo, I need to email this to the Kumamoto JET community to make this part of their orientation for incoming JETS in Kumamoto. 😂This song practically represents Kumamoto.
I waited so long for this series to continue i watch this and the last atleast 3 times to take in the amazing videography and cast
How much volcano? 😳
Chris is getting skinny😳
The song is actually catchy and good, somehow, well done.
God I love this content.  Would you ever consider, after the pandemic, doing a sort of "tour" of Japan with live subscribers? They pay their way and you would just show them around.  I know there we are able to virtually, but I think it would be cool to see interactions with fans.  (Probably would need some serious vetting to sort out the crazies haha)
Not enough volcano and shabbing
This challenge definitely makes up for the first one. The series is amazing keep it up Chris!
So glad to see the three of you together on a journey again! The song is pretty fantastic, guys. Seriously.  Very catchy.
Yooo this is GOLD, Natsuki can spit!!!
I LOVED too much Volcano only thing missing was you Chris hehehe
That rap was a masterpiece. Also so glad that Natsuki is getting one hell of a holiday with you and Joey. Knowing how crazy Japan's work life is like its nice to see him having an adventure with mates.
Christ, these comments are infected by bots in replies.
23:15 this is going on the trash taste subreddit for sure
I am STUNNED there was no mention of Pit Bull since this was such a rapcentric adventure
Natsuki’s accent is so heavy Chris still has to use subtitles when he speaks English
This was AMAZING! It's literally stuck in my head on repeat! Another blow you away episode!  Wow that Inn was stunning 😍 Those onsens look incredible. I'm so jealous that I can't visit Japan it hurts 💔   Chris what you're doing for Natsuki is so sweet. Hes having the time of his life and I'm sure it's thanks to you. You're a good guy.
I’m gonna have that hook stuck in my head for a while
We don't deserve quality content like this. Keep it up you absolutly beautiful lads
2:14 ah yes, Aerosmith, my favorite rapper
You damn well made up for the failing to catch your meal. Damn! Rocking out!
Put that song on spotify!
Very cool adventure! 😂
Natsuki in that music video, what a presence! He's a natural showman, stays in character, unlike that Joey who can't stop smiling like Bill Heder on SNL!  ALSO: where's the beatboxing in the music video, Chris? No beatboxing breakdown bridge? Can't tease us like that!
Oh wow!! 👏👏
Use Bollywood songs in ur videos
That rap was (no pun intended) fire🌋🔥
Awesome job boys ! And definitely not as cringy as initially expected. Thanks Joey :)
I'll have that tune stuck in my head now
Great Journey episode! Very beautiful there. I can't wait for the next one. Chris on a horse! 😯 Keep shabbing Natsuki, hope you enjoyed your vacation!
Probably the only rap song to ever use the Wilhelm Scream!
ok but its actually a bop
Very catchy #TooMuchVolcano
Too much volcano 🌋 💃🏻🕺🏻
I cringed in the proudest way at the song🤣 it was actually impressive
Haha 'Natsuki's Holiday' the true title of this series.
Considering you had 9 hours to record this you actually came up with some good lyrics. You can really see each person's personality shine in this music video. I'm going to have "ASO volcano" stuck in my head from now on and I don't mind at all. This music video is way better than some that have an actual budget cause they spend it on mansion and people as extras to have dancing in the background. Its like they care more about the shot and the actual lyrics, which shows cause they all boil down to partying, drugs, and bitches. But this has clearly shows the creativity of everyone involved. (It shows that creativity shines during times of crisis (9 hours))
Please that rap song put such a big smile on my face, I loved it. 😭💕
I love the rap😂😂
"A-S-O so much volcano" > <
When are you gonna start giving us 8k videos?
Could've added a faint Dr. Jelly thing at the beginning of the song like a sort of producer tag
To much volcano... Is on Spotify?
It won't reach the popularity of Gangnam Style, but it was a good first attempt!
This is gonna take off just like PPAP....
I like that bird near the drone 8:33
So much volcano!  🤘😎
The moment "Too much volcano" that took a couple of hours to make is better than rap songs in general.
That rap song was awesome! Great job guys!
bruh, littt
Where is dr. JELLY!!!!
A...S...O...M...G!!! This has only cemented my need to go to Kurokawa Onsen.The bloopers and BTS must be epic.
I really like the rap no cap 😎
Not gonna lie, that rap was fire.
Chris, the editing of that rap video was awesome. I’m going to be singing it all week long xD Great job to all you guys!
Can’t wait for the next fire drop
The next Gangnam Style for sure. Place your bets everybody.
the song turned out pretty well
Damm, ngl that was a killer rap song.
Why is this so catchy?
That rap song was hard
The rap song is stuck in my head. Guess I know what I'm singing tomorrow!
as a fellow white person like Chris, I noticed your new red skin tone. I too have gotten this skin tone, through yellow stone. Glad I can relate to Crisp Broad.
Spotify link when?
I thoroughly enjoyed the rap and can't wait for what's next.
In 9 hours they produced a song and video better than I did one video in 3 months. My pride hurts a little
Joey: That's a weird ass bathtub Also Joey: Proceeds to go in the bathtub
Great video! Can you please link the places you stayed in the description to make it easier to find?
The cinematography really puts it all together
My last song syndrome will be the “ASO too much volcano” 😆 always a nice way to watch never disappoint…
I marvel at the fact that YouTube is free!  This content is amazing!  💕
Almost forgot to hit like on the video I was so entertained. Keep being amazing Chris, given me the push I need to get serious on my studying to finally move to Japan.
I would buy the rap song XD
10:05 "Elon Musk would love it"
I'd like to get my hands on Chris' Volcano...
Asking for a rap song, was the best decision of someone's life. I genuinely thank the guy that asked that! XD I haven't enjoyed myself, laughing and smiling at Joey's awkward movements and Natsuki's close up shots, backed with a good rap from The Anime Man and an electronic dance beat from Chris xD 't was _cool_!
Hell yeah another episode baby !!!
Holy shiet, that was one hell of a song~!!! XD Nicely done~ Kurokawa Onsen & Mt Aso~~ Next destination when world returns to normal~ Keep it up guys~!!
This is in fact the rap song that we never knew we needed, Good job mates this journey is one for the records!
Video looks fun guy!
Not bad
no you didn't
what is that music making app?
❤️
Awesome love your videos. The rap son is brilliant.
23:16 I would've loved to see Chris doing this XDD
That was great! Good job guys 👍
❤️
I almost choked on my coffee when I heard the Wilhelm scream. XD Great beats by Chris B and great rap by JJ and Natsuki!
They are capsule homes from  dragonball
Light Yagami would've been the perfect rhyme for Black Tatami
ASO too much volcano stuck in my head
Black tatami, gives flashbacks of mommy makin my favorite pastrami. uwu
Didn't need? I'm wondering when the greatest hits get released!
I hate you. It's been an hour and that chorus is still stuck in my head. Make it stoooop
The vid was shabu and the rap was 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Lulz. You found Namek. Hahaha
What the heck!? I wasn't expecting the rap to actually be good!
Hey Chris, loving this series! Do you have a link to the onsen inn you stayed at? Couldn’t find it. Thanks!
Oh hey, it's the small blanket at the end of the bed for your shoe's that the Trash Taste crew hates.
Catchy song! I say that's a win!
Finally, a rap song that I didn't dislike!
21:24 Too Much Volcano
Mori calliope need to cover this song
Nice haircut
To much volcano is a banger 💪🔥
spotify when
Getting strong Will Smith Jazzy Jeff vibes from this rap
I love u dudes ❤️❤️💥💦☔️🎩🎩
Well I have to say , now I have A S O so much volcano stuck in my head
What app did you use to make the music?
aborad in japan?   more like, a bri'ish man too scared to rap, in japan
AsO so much volcano. What an ear worm
You guys are adorable and very talented with the rap song and video. Thanks for for FUN !!! 🙌🎶🌟💝🎶🌎😊🙌
Eminem been silence since Joey and Natsuki starts rapping
Too much Volcano will now be forever stuck in my head. Especially love the line about salami. Nice job, guys!
Too much Volcano
Fun vid, the chorus is now stuck in my head
When Natsuki said:  "Extra Salami"  I felt that
We have a new hit here!
That igloo village reminds me of a Studio Ghibli movie! It's cute!  Also, that rap was surprisingly adequate! Good job!
btw, for those who are curious why Joey and natsuki were stirring their baths: Convection causes hot water to rise and cold water to sink. As a result, the water near the surface of the bath is extremely hot, to cool this down to a better temperature, one would stir the bath to mix the hot water and the colder water on the bottom.
That was AMAZING!!!!!
This is definitely one of my favourite episodes of Journey Across Japan across the 3 series. Great work Chris, and thanks Natsuki, Joey, and whole team. Well done, take care!
ohhh asahi.
I'll use the song as my alarm in the morning 😆
If i had a dollar for every time in my life that I had too much volcano....
Chris showing his phone beat: Feels kind of weak. Full song plays: That actually fits really well.
Joey's anime drip
Finally, something to look forwards to on Sundays.
Too much volcano is a banger... it hits different you know?!?
I actually had the opportunity to stay at Aso Farm Village, on a family trip.   One thing they don’t tell you about the domes is that they act as a parabolic reflector, so your snoring gets bounced around the inside and drives other people in the same dome bonkers.   Probably why I was exiled to my own (significantly cheaper, and in a completely different zone) dome by night two.
3:21 Those houses looks like straight from the anime Dragon Ball
When’s the song dropping on Spotify!?
That song wasn't actually all that horrid, still way better than any of this mumble rap that's been going around, props my guys
Fucking shit the song slapped
The real reason Natsuki got his own room was so Chris and Joey could have their alone bath time again 😆
Australian Jim Morrison is a pretty good Rapper I must say.
Now I'm not going to get that song out of my head ...
It made me smile. So it was good.
Too Much Volcano. A worryingly good rap by the Nippon Trio. Great work boys!
Love the fact that natsuki insta bio says: @abroadinjapan is my brother in the second line
ASO too much volcano!! now we need FKS too much radiation go to Fukushima!!
00:17 I always smile when I hear it.
Have a competition on who can do the best anime voice
damn i jumped when chris pretended to push Natsuki into the bath
I think that was the best music video of 2021 and I doubt it can be beat so job well done
Was that a thong we saw?
ASO Too Much Volcano is stuck in my head now.  Thanks.  *Screams existentially*
05:13 no lock on the bathroom door?
I had such a hprrible day today, and watching the latest two videos of Journey Across Japan? This made me so happy. It was full of laughs and excitement that even I, sad and stuck at home, could feel. Wonderful content, Chris, keep up all the great and hilarious work!
That music video was actually so goooood lol
Given the time and resources, you all have made a fantastic rap video worthy of a Grammy nomination. Great job, Abroad in Aso team!
when asia produces the weirdest tv and yet the dude born there says "not a weird challenge" you know something aint right
Chris looks souless in this thumbnail
Excellent! I really enjoyed that, got the feelings you guys did as well.
More cowbell, 2 out of 10 hot steamy men
Why is that rap actually kinda fire?  See what i did there? Fire, volcano...ill see myself out
Nice one guys.. liked it.
That was so good.
Best rap song and videoclip EVER!! Too Much Volcano!! F***ing masterpiece!
Flintstones, Smurfs? Nah, those are definitely Capsule Corp houses.
I'm surprised they didn't make that volcano blow with that dope rap song.
it was so wholesome when natsuki was shone his room I LOVE JOURNEY ACROSS JAPAN
A.S.O to much Volcano!!!
I loved it, I'd love to see more Joey raps <3
Too much volcano
TOO MUCH VALCANO
Too much salami for one onsen.
To much volcano
Chris is drinking in the onsen with two Japanese guys and somehow has the reddest face.
Yo Chris I noticed youve been really trolling natsuki this trip . Ur Lucky Ryotoro isn't around. Hes your worst nightmare .🥺
I died when ""A-S-O so much volcano" was rapped
For a moment when Natsuki was rapping I thought I was listening to Redman himself
So fucking good...
This was so great that it made my day so much more better thank you for your hard work guys 😎👍👏👏👏👏
Is that where Ran was filmed?  Edit: just looked it up, plains of Aso...cool!
Too much volcano😂👌🏿
“NO VOLCANO!” 🤣
I really enjoy your song 👏👏👏
Your hair looks fresh.
Very shitty day until I saw this was up, yay!
I have an idea for the next Journey Across Japan... "Journey Across Japan: Natsuki goes to Anime Expo". Needs to happen
Still waiting for you to cover yourself in custard for 24 hours, Chris.
the amount of effort you put into film making is inspiring
That rap made me want to be dead and also wish ill upon you all (other than Natsuki). Also how do you rhyme "tatami" with "salami" rather than "umami" which you could have used to reference your shabu shabu or some shit?!
Given the fact that it was made in 4 hours, that shit was 🔥🔥🔥
That was awesome guys 👍👍❤️❤️
The only rap with a wilhelm scream.
This song needs to win all the song awards in existance
Loved it
Please never abandon the signature Chris Broad “dejected trumpet” sound, it was perfect when Natsuki couldn’t open that igloo door
It’s the “Wheeze” hoodie for me 💯👌
Breakin' dem beats in dem igloo streets! Too much volcano wasn't a total fiasco! Word to 'Ski! Those hot springs look absolutely therapeutic and would be an excellent place to do what you guys did and munch some Shabu Shabu and drink some Ice cold brewski! Looking forward to the next episode!  Have a Maximum Pleasant Week, everyone!!
Too much volcano! lol great rap, great job, you guys, gosh that Natsuki is funny.  You're all a treat, well done, Chris, Joey, Natsuki, that rap challenge was a good one but you all rose to the occasion.  I really enjoyed the video, thank you, have fun, keep being awesome.
love it!
😀😀😘❤🇦🇷
That song is going to be stuck in my head for the rest of the night! Lol
I Just love your videos, you are all very funny and entertaining and the rap video was actualy impressive lol  I found your channel recently and i really love your dry and sarcastic humor (i'm sorry for any tipos but i'm not a native speaker)
i wanted to hear chris rapping and  natsuki rapping in japanese :c
i feel bad for saying that i really underestimated how great the rap song turned out to be, i was laughing the whole time but it really came together so well
The production quality of the rap song was actually top-notch
This is the best song about volcanos I have ever heard.
Shabbing sounds like Shagging and everything is wrong now
YES IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THE NEXT EPISODE 😭 I’m so sad my phone was off when the notification went off... looks like I’ll be sleeping later than anticipated
actually really good music video
Fresh Anime in Bel Aso
Too much volcano on Spotify when Chris? <3
Visited the volcano with my parents in the mid 70s. Was way cool until the volcano rescue people told us it was time to go. Apparently when the vapour darkens it's not a good sign.🌋
It might've been the "shabba dabba doo" line, but I'm just now realizing Natsuki looks like a Japanese Fred Flintstone
Must say watching your videos drunk at 2 AM is a very much diferente expirience.
Today is the day Eminem has been dethroned as Rap King
I'll never think of the word Volcano the same way again.
My Stars, this is so wholesome ✨
I can't stand it, I know you planned it I'm gonna set it straight, this Watergate I can't stand rocking when I'm in here 'Cause your crystal ball ain't so crystal clear So while you sit back and wonder why I got this fucking thorn in my side Oh my God, it's a mirage I'm tellin' y'all, it's a TOBACCOTTAGE!
Loved the rap! There is never too much volcano!
for a track written by three guys with little to no musical training, and written, performed, and produced in a day, that was pretty astounding
Haha love the rap you guys came up with, now its going to be stuck in my head the rest of the day.
The song was so funny omg LMAO I loved it! it had a fresh prince of bel air vibe to it.
This rap is a bop. You should put it on iTunes! Trust me there's worse! I can see this as an outro for an anime!
Ur living my dream
the rap hit the spot when Natsuki saying too much volcano then no volcano right after that XD
The original Journey Across Japan was three years ago? I feel old.
I love the rap, bit all I keep thin is how much I want to find a sweater like Joey's.  Where can I find that sweet Area 51 jumper!?!
This series deserve 10millions views.
so yeah...where do i download the song lol
Japan is one gigantic super volcano..
EXTRA SALAMI
hahahhaah this is cool ngl
filthy frank feels challenged
Pure pleasure every moment! Just love you guys!
That Joey dance
thanks for the content christ
Good video. Needs more salami.
the best rap song ive heard in years! awesome!
That rap was insane for 9 hours! Great job dudes.
Rap was surprisingly good! Loved the episode!
Da rap 🔥🔥🔥 Those lyrics broooh LET'S GOOOOO
Kurokawa onsen is beautiful. We went there for our honeymoon!
I would start smoking to be able to enter the Tabaccotage.
I’m going to be singing this at work  A. S O. Too much volcano.
not enough volcano ~ need it's own video ! came out great haha
Awesome 😎
So... that was dope af!
Damn the production is getting better and even feature a music video!!
chris made the instrumental through an app?? i need to know what app that is :O
Why the fuck are you guys wearing swimwear? Any cloth is not supposed to get into the water.
The rap song is better than 99% of the music on the radio when i get in my car.
"Too Much Volcano" who knew it would be such a banger!
Joey seems to have a tendency to jump into bath tubs whenever he gets into a hotel. He did it in almost every Journey Across Japan series, at least once.
it seems like if this is for Disneyland theme park where guest can stay in expensive house style rooms.  they just need to decorate the interior with Disney theme wall paper but the rest already seem Disney like.
Always f@cking place! Why me?! 😂😂😂🐶  ❤️NATSUKI!
The 2018 facial hair. Absolutely legendary.
Ngl, weird as the village is those houses look really cozy and I could easily imagine living in one with a moderate level of comfort
“Sittin’ on the black tatami, with the homies sucking on salami”
Natsuki is Japan’s Natural Treasure.
That was....wow
ASO  To much volcano 🌋
Chris ma man , you put bloody too much effort into your videos ...can't stop admiring your efforts
8:54 that red soil looks amazing
WOOO! Here we go!
Too much volcano ! - Ok- this is the line I will be repeating whole day today. Damn you guys.
On Spotify when?
THAT WAS INSANE WOW THE QUALITY
looking forward to the next episode, always wanted to watch a britishman on a horse
Ermmmm wait. Chris isn’t this your channel, challenge?!, where was your rapping?!! I feel like Natsuki snook that challenge in!! He had way too much fun making that!! Love it. That Onsen looked amazing. Would have been nicer with traditional beds though!!
Tbh the rap was a lot better than I thought it would be, hahaha. 🤣
Good job boys. But all that really matters is that you are having FUN. Try to take some time to e*enjoy* the journey, don't work too hard just to keep us happy. Love and hugs from Florida, USA!
Spoil Natsuki Day
That Rock will be a national landmark. Give it about 5 years.
ASO!
What have i just watched at the end of the video hahahaha, it made me laugh a lot. Keep going on with this AinJ videos! Btw You are putting on weight Chris o.O
that town looks like if the guy that designed tatooine went to design hobbiton
The best rap song ever ffs :')
Natsuki - Two much volcano (ft. Joey the anime man) (Prod. Chris from Abroad in Japan)
So much volcano. So much ASO.
Listening to Natsuki's English brings me an unreasonable amount of happiness.
The song absolutely slaps
That’s the best rap song I’ve heard in a while!!!!!!!! Hahahah ASO too much volcano 🌋
Always fucking place
You do not disappoint.
I think I finally know where to film my dystopian sci-fi film.
At this point there has to be enough musical material to releas a Natsuki-themed EP and that's the only thing I want from now on (<rascal bicycle *Donald duck sound*> always in our hearts)
I HOPE ASO!
NATSUKI cave, so deep, much wet! 😂🐶
Aso, climbin to the top like a gastro, nomic expert, wine an climb wine an rhyme, no stoppin us now, hit this flow, an don't forget tobacco, for a smoke, a toke, three blokes an the magma, stags, duh, that's how it is an how we do, a rap for you and Mary Sue, PEACE. lol it's fun just thinking up this stuff you guys killed it love the journey, so much volcano. Maybe Anpanman will hit you with some cycling too :D hope you brought your trusty old pumpkin helmet
The rap was better than I thought it was going to be. Not good but not terrible
The song reminded me of some old school 80s rap so good
😂 you guys rock! Seriously laughed so hard. Thank you for this! Can't wait for the next video.
The song I never knew I didn't need. Yep that is accurate.
Please release "Too Much Volcano" as it's own video! I would like to add it to my music list. You guys did great!
damn this season of journey across japan is gonna be good and we only 2 episodes in 🔥🔥🔥
The song slaps. Great work. Keep up the awesome content
Loving the series so far. ! So good
Aso! Let's go!
That Aso Farm Village could be easily the best stage for the japanese version of The Prisoner.
the rap was hilarious... great rhymes, funky beat.  the wierd dancing got me giggling non stop at work tho. ROFL. great Job guys. quite honestly the rap gives the Dr. Jelly commercial a run for its money.
Joey looked so uncomfortable dancing in the village 😂, I know that face and he hated it 😂😆
Great series Chris! And that rap was awesome guys! Look forward to seeing more!
Impressed with the rap song…well done!
Too much Volcano speaks to my soul
When are we seeing Too Much Volcano on Spotify?
The rap was kinda fire tho
That really is so much volcano
Does anyone know what kind of shoes Natuski is wearing?
Another hit
Thoose igloos are def Capsule Corp. houses.
danger volcano!
Good job guys!!! Love it and now "ASO too much volcano" is now stuck in my head!! Very talented! Love you Nippon trio!
Joey dancing by the Igloos reminded me of Kanchome from Zatch Bell Back up Dancing Folgore XD
You can brand a new series as ' Abroad in a van'.
of course sexy shirtless chris is at the end of the video :)
Beautiful hotel and I adore the claw tub! Miss mine so much
that subtle Wilhelm scream during the rap...that made me laugh even more.  Great job guys!
I think the domes failed because there are not much surrounding activities or onsite activities. For $100 or night, you can most likely get something near downtown where you are at least closed to restaurant and transportation to other attractions.
Still better than everything on the Radio in the UK.
I don't know why but Chris just seems way more relaxed for this Journey across Japan and it's been really nice to see!  Keep it up, man!
I've found my new favorite rap song
Best rap ever!!....excellent episode!!
Impressed with the rap song…well done!
Natsuki and Joey have great flow. If Chris sang his flow would be worse than Mt. Aso's pyroclastic flow
Genuinely good rap, very fun, I have to say Joey's solo work is better but at least this is in English.
We should be able to find that song on spotify too right?
Every time I watch an episode of the the journey across Japan there something amazing about it, I think we need more volcano 😂
Now this is a jam.
You guys are hilarious ! Thanks for your hard work Chris !  (It's definitely like Bedrock !)
A  S   O Too much Volcano
natsukis english is broken af , but i understand him more than some native english speakers . why does something broken sound so right ??
This song is stuck in my head now. Waiting for it to hit Spotify.
would be amazing if you could please link the places you stay/ things you do in the description. would love to go to that onsen hotel.
Takefue is the place to be in Kurokawa!
too much volcano a whole ass banger
Ok but who tf is filming!? Sharla?!?!?!
FUCKING AWESOME!
my sundays are much better now
I dont normally comment but this is a bloody EPIC episode !!!!! Well done boys !!!!!
Too Much Volcano!   8888
"I like pizza, extra salami!" lol, loved the rap. Great job on the challenge. Natsuki certainly looks like he's enjoying himself, and Joey dances like my husband lol. Keep on grooving man.
Wasn't expecting a rap that good...
They do be shabbing in the banks tho.😳
I'm not sure it's possible to have too much volcano haha 🤣 Loved the video thought it was brilliant and hilarious
Good job guys. This was a good one. Yall had fun
A s o... Too much volcano
12/10 would listen to that rap again. I am sad we didn’t get to see Chris spitting bars, but he did a helluva job with the music. ASO Worldwide
ASO too much volcano a o
Chris was busy producing the music as ABeat in Japan
FIRE! FIRE! AAAAa!!!!!!!!!
If you've been to Australia, $100 can get you a lot worse here! And earthquake proof? Take my money! Wait... is there internet?
I swear to god Chris you deserve at least 5m subscribers. You’re too good!!! And together with Joey and Natsuki it’s crazy!
Edit : a ! S ! O !!! Vibing !!  Right in time for dinner. Ty , your content ascends the yt name 👏. Feels more like this should be on travel chanel , history chanel , maybe even tlc lol . My point is keep it up I love it !
Joey could've rhymed with tatami: "On a deluxe onsen with my homie"
you're lucky Joey was along to write all your lyrics!!!! I did have a good time watching this!
Omg that rap had Fresh prince vibes. Please do this again😂
Tbh it's actually a banger track, really enjoyed Natsuki's chorus!
There being a mountain called "Aso-san" brings me such joy. It being a gassy pit in the ground just helps.
I love the rap song, it's catchy & funny. But what dose ASO stand for?
I would love to see a super hero team up with Chris and Nux Taku
Lmaooo for only a few hours this is a lit song 🤣 thank you for your hard work and dedication
No joke been depressed last couple weeks and this video made me smile and laugh more than I have in months! God this was super fun
I know Chris said it's hard to make friends in Japan unless people are outsiders, but Natsuki and Chris are such a match!
After finishing the video. I enjoyed the rap song! Great work guys.
Too Much Volcano is my new favorite thing. 😂 It's totally shabbing!
I UNIRONICALLY LOVE THE SONG TBH
Okay, looking at the comments it's no surprise you guys nailed it 👍 I'm just another comment to confirm that.
Amazing stuff guys! : D
Loving this series. Gives me loads of travel ideas.
It's full of the smell of sulfur
Gj, the rap was surprisingly and pleasantly good.
Gotta admit, that was kind of a bop.
I'm 100% singing this song as I get my Covid shot tomorrow. That hook is WAY too catchy!
Everyone here likes Chris. But we like Natsuki 1000x more. He gets automatic love.
Another great episode! Too Much Volcano is a BANGER. Joey's got some serious moves.
Nice use of the Wilhelm Scream. Good job guys.
I like how Chris finds hilarous everything Natsuki does or says. Cute
Natsuki 🥰
Ill be humming this rap for the whole day.
Q: How do you get an English fatty to stay in a $100 igloo hotel? A: Ask him nicely, he's a friendly geezer.
Was good and funny 😄
Eyyyyy nice jobs, its much better thought is going to be
That Wilhelm scream is so Iconic I could hear it from a while away
A.S.O too much volcano !
joey really rocking the fakku shirt
Natski looks like that guy from ganam style this those shades on lol grate video guys
Man the cowbell in the beat with Joey's early 00s white rapper flow is too good I love it
That was great rap guys! I would love to see a Dr Jelly Rap in a future Journey Across Japan series. 😁
Well done! Too much!
Gonna need so much volcano on Apple Music ASAP
When I was scrolling through YouTube and saw this video i thought it was a sidemen vid for a sec cuz of the thumbnail.
A S O Too much volcano!
Best video ever. I wish I was part of it. I’m definitely going to Aso someday soon. Good job boys! Love the rap. Looking forward to the next vlog.
Great video all around. Its always fun seeing what kind of charades you guys get into.  The music challenge was flawless. Expected nothing less!
A•S•O So Much Volcano!! 🌋 That’s impressive for 9 hours work, lyrics, the creation of “shabbing”, filming, editing etc. I expect this to go on Spotify, and nomination for best ‘foreign release’ at the Grammys. But 23:16 #Joey what is with the dad moves!? Lol j/k. 😂🤣😂
Watching this on a Monday morning ✨
What is that app called?? It sounds so cool! Even just that quick tune you made in a second!
Too Much VOLCANO needs an award
Well done on your rap it was rather good and funny also. GJ
Truly an epic rap!
challenge of the day: sacrifice joey for a guaranteed good next season of one punch man
the rap is a hard bop
Joey's rapping Style reminded me of Will Smith Summertime song. I think that rap song should have its own video just dedicated to its originality and sheer entertainment value alone.
Well, it’s stuck in my head! So good job.
You have outdone yourselves! This was fabulous!
A.S.O too much volcano~ ヽ(>∀<☆)ノ
The rap was quite good whahaha
Natsuki is such a good balance he speaks more Japanese and is hilarious with his little bits of english. It's great! Too much volcano lmfao!
That sulfur dioxide gas, when combined with water (such as on your eyes) reacts to make an acid. Not like the most dangerous acid ever but still.
Miyachi has been real quiet since this dropped.
Epic song loved it
Imma be vibing to this for years
Absolutely fantastic rap video
That rap made my day. Not kidding, it was a crap of a day, this made me laugh, I am glad there are many more episodes to come!
that rap has so many prince of bel air bibes
God I’m going to have that song stuck in my head the next few days
rap was straight fire
Omg love the 80s vibe on the music app Chris
Chris, I hate to say it but you could probably get rich off the views for that rap video all by itself. The internet loves a good meme.
Holy shit that song was catchy. Please release it on Spotify.
Loved the rap💖
Brilliant.
It's kinda catchy. Not gonna lie.
Great effort with the rap lads. A++
Not a single one of them said the village looked like Dr Seuss...  And now I'm wondering if Dr Seuss has any presence in Japan, Britain, or Australia.
Too much volcano
Chris w the fire beat, and Joey's dance in the video was hilarious lmao  Edit: and now I have natsuki's hook in my head lol
*Though he unlocked the door* *Pulls on door*  PHUCK.
I know for a fact I'm gonna be singing "Too Much Volcano" nonstop at work tomorrow.
Lovely stuff - enjoying so far and yeah - rap was great!!
There is too much volcano, I can understand that.  But then there is no volcano. Who took the volcano? Where did it go? Is the volcano okay?  Should I call the police and report it missing?
You guys made my day hahahaha grat lyrics
Top 10 rappers Eminem was too afraid to diss
21:58 New Abroad In Japan intro Like if you agree
Omg this was great! 🎉🎉🎉  Low-key wish Chris had a rap line, but you can't win them all!
NATSUKI is Aso, but Chris broad is an Assho!e!😂
Fuck you man this music video SLAPS  playing humble
Nice
A S O too much volcano
That hip hoppity my dude
Have you ever gone to see Babymetal in concert while you're over there?
LOVE THE RAP XD
GO TO  21:24  IF YOU WANT TO HEAR BARS 🔥
Even setting aside the constraints, that was honestly a very good effort on the rap song.
May I ask what the background song is during Natsuki's onsen room bit? Thanks in advance!
Chris, can you please sell as merch a book of out of context natski quotes and make them look serious in black and white.
Its was pretty good
So frustrating when you realise you've been watching in 1080p and halfway through the video you realise you've been scammed out of 4k content
24:10 BGM?
This song is fucking dope. That's fire
No video is complete without a Wilhelm scream.
Why does this rap sound similar to the songs id hear in elementary school trying to teach me something
You should’ve had “Dave in Japan” do a guest verse to add to that straight fire 🔥
That song slaps!!
Like when you want to turn C.C on because Chris's UK/English  accent  and not 'cus Natsuki broken English  :)
Can you upload just the music video so I can listen to it without having to skip through this video?
Not gonna lie that song slaps
A S O part was actually catchy 😂👏  edit: i like this challenge! the video is so fun to watch!
A S O TOO MUCH VOLCANO!!!!!
That music video directing was actually top notch
the hook is actually hooking, damn
This rap was really worth watching this at 2am
me: homework or journey across japan also me: fails english class
When are we getting "Let's Go" shirts?
Awww yeah
the igloo village looks like its from Dragon Ball!!!!
This video made me want all the volcano.
You should release a hit, I can totally see this becoming a hit in Japan  Too much volcano… no volcano… no volcano… 🎶
That was hilarious! 😂 I love it! Top notch as always.
I swear I'll be dreaming tonight, and then out of nowhere, I'm going to hear "...too much volcano". 🌋
Absolute Banger of a song at the end well done lads looking forward to the next episode
Too much Volcano
.... did I just watch Synthpop Rap??  I'm really enjoying you guys touring places I got to visit and live (I lived on Kyushu for close to 4 years before we moved elsewhere). Great work on the rap, guys!
Actually better music than most crap in the charts. 👏
Tabbacottage! Sounds like a specialty Aso Volcanic cheese! Tabbocottage cheese, got the perfect combination of volcanic tobacco, aso, and cheese all in one bite 🧀🗻🚬
Japan is weird. It's music is often  weird. Natsuki is eccentric. Chris has driven himself insane by going on these journey's . Joey is Chris's unlucky victim of Abroad in Japan and all of this has created "Too much volcano". What more could a sad weird person sitting in their bed at home ask for?
Honestly the fact you made an entire song in such a short time is pretty good ! You should release the song seperate and see how many views it gets with people confused where " to much volcano" came from  Then boom more views on this  It goes full circle
A rap song i indeed never needed >.<
The songs pretty catchy ngl hahaha thanks for the great video! That onsen town looks wonderful.
Time to guess on how long before Chris gets a copyright strike on the song "Too Much Volcano".
Your videos are as amazing as always! Great entertainment and inspiration for a hobby film maker :) Looking forward to the next one!
"ASO, so much volcano" is going to be living on my mind rent free for the next month. I can already tell.
Love how Joey is always the only one entertained by his own shenanigans. The rap was, quite something...
Natsuki should be careful about standing near the water when Chris is around 😂😂
🎵 A! S! O! So much Volcano! So much Volcano! No Volcano! No Volcano 2X 🎶 ......... shabbing...
Totally blown away! Haha absolutely loved the rap... 😂😍🌋.... A S 🪨
Three alcoholic uncles n way too much volcano.
I have a new favorite rap song now. Natsuki makes everything better.
ASO -- so much volcano. Damn this is gonna be stuck in my head the whole night. And I love it!
14:21  That bath and view tho
okay but the rap was actually good tho 👀
Why was this song an actual banger XD
I'm going to go ahead and need the name of that Ryokan, please
Jeez, those igloo hotels are a lot more depressing on the inside than I imagined.
dude the scenery at 8:55 is beautiful! look at those colors!
You say these episodes are gonna be longer than normal, and yet this is only 25 mins long... I was expecting 40-60mins an episode, bit of a let down to be honest
“Too much volcano” hits better than a lot of songs ive heard  Holy 490 likes lads thanks for the love
so when will the song be on itunes?
A... S... O... So much volcano (rap).... Too much volcano (rap)... But seriously, excellent.
This video is worth the wait!!
Holy crap that Kurokawa Onsen is beautiful
So catchy!!! I love it!!!!
That was amazing lol.
Can you release this song officially somehow?  I'd buy the DVD.
I feel like the rap missing a Japanese verse is a missed opportunity.  I still love everything about this though.
Bro put too much volcano on Spotify that's a bop
We don’t live in Japan, but speak Japanese. So by watching your videos, we have become Japanese. Logic +1 Hei
I would thank the person who submitted the challenge... This was too good.
that rap was so endearing....
It's a good thing that Natsuki and Joey are musical. I really enjoyed the video. 😁
Gotta love the Wilhelm-scream at 22:55 :D Love your videos!! :D
ASO too much volcano those lyrics will stuck in my head for the next week at least
With that rap song.. where is the girls? 😉
I laughed as soon at the rap started; once I saw Joey's face..
Natsuki is a Rock Star
Those houses look like something from a RPG. Not bad for first time out the gate rap song.👍👍
No one is gonna talk about how these houses look like the ones from dragon ball... no one... ok
So much Volcano! Great rap.
Only rappers Eminem is scared to diss
"EXTRA SALAMI"
Best rap song of 2021
What I say when she asks for sex before marriage:  10:59
When can we expect Too Much Volcano on Spotify?
bless you lads always a blast watching you guys enjoy yourselves across the country!
This video's was kawaii
Catchy song! A S O No Volcano! 🌋
for only 9 hours that was pretty solid ... especially the edit ... as always Great work Chris...
The rap was exactly  what I needed😂😂😂
Lol. The rap song is pretty catchy.
That was amazing. You can never have too much volcano.
You guys are the best, that rap video is legit, stuck in my head. Great dance moves from Dr. Jelly too
I mean… I know the first 3/4th of this video are the main focus but…. That last 1/4th is where the fires at! 🔥🔥🔥🌋🌋🌋
Best. And why The Wilhelm Scream. Why.
There was an attempt, and it was atleast a little better then I expected lol 8)
These are some serious bars man
Please release Too Much Volcano by itself so we can put it on repeat
Too Much Volcano is LIT. Hahahaha
Please add too much volcano on spotify
Joey's dance moves in the village were quite something, I feel like 'A S O, so much volcano' is now gonna be stuck in my head for a long time together with those images, thanks for that Chris.
looks a bit like the shire from lord of the rings lmfao
Top 10 rappers that eminem is afraid to diss
Not that I care, but I couldn’t help but notice that the boys say “fuck” and “shit” quite often, but still the video is monetized. Makes me wonder, as a new YouTuber, how can this be? I have a channel and heard a bunch of people say you cannot swear if you want to monetize the video.
As always Chris, your content is exceptional. Watching your videos you can see incredible progress in your production quality, you've matured into a fantastic content creator.   ~ Your favourite furry rodent,   CheesyLemming oxoxox
I see where most of the edit efforts went into this Across in Japan lmao
Awesome vid!
This looks too good, definitely too much volcano.
the song is actually quite good
You guys were definitely staying at a Capsule Corp. hotel
Ａｓｏ
So impressive to watch Chris and the crew improve. The rap was hilarious and amazing, you all are so creative!
That song was way better than I expected! Extra salami! You idiots
I want to take my wife to Japan but can't 😭 maybe one day. I need to feel the atmosphere. I'm not weird I promise. Lmao
Honestly it’s just nice seeing you guys enjoy things. I generally hate music with lyrics or covers of songs but the rap was a great listen. Wish you and the crew all the best.
VEVO has being really quiet since this dropped
i love you.
Seriously thought nothing would ever top Dr. Jelly. 🌋 Literally crying from laughing from Joey and Natsuki’s dancing and Joey’s lyrics. Well done on this challenge, boys!
Imagine if they actually had enough time to make music. Platinum records waiting guaranteed!
At 22:34, Chris must have had a heart attack dodging the camera away from Natsuki’s water splash😂
Why hasn’t NHK hired you yet?
I always wondered who is behind the camera filming the documentary.
The Monday morning release, (Japan time) of these is a ‘mare to deal with, the workday has already started fella!
I love the rap
The igloo village was empty because unfortunately japanese people dont really take much vacations.
YouTube's best series
LOL. I never get enough of These videos. The rap was awesome. :)
Cool video
This is the kind of entertainment I need after a long shift. Always cheers me up
Something Nice?
For a one day rap, that was really good.  Or at least a lot of fun 😊 Great job guys!
I'm going to work today with A S O so much volcano lingering in my mind haha
The Too Much Volcano rap was a whole new magmatude...  Was hoping Dr. Jelly would eruptly jump in as a cameo :
“A rap song you never knew we didn't need”  What do you mean? We definitely needed it!
Sing it with me: A S O, too much volcano
The song feels like “hello fellow kids”
Honestly for a song made in 9 hours it was very good
Too much volcano will be playing on a loop in my head for the rest of the week.
Awesome! I've been looking forward to this all day--exceeded expectations and then some!!
Chris man how am i supposed to watch these videos on release without having a awful sleep schedule
That rap was fun and not half bad. I love the video and can't wait for the next one
A all S so O outstanding
This is literally what I look forward to Sunday after work, thanks Chris for producing this awesome content
What is the point of them stirring the bath? Just curious because I have never seen that.   Also, I swear Journey Across Japan gets higher and higher in quality every episode and season.
In a Siimon Cowell voice: "You know, with a lot of hard work and a truckload of faith that rap could be a hit."
Yassss
Journey Across Japan: dinner is shabu shabu  me: i just have a burger with pickles....
My sons and I tune in for every video drop.. My elder is 13, my youngest is 10.. Im 41..too much volcano entertained all three of us.. Just good quality entertaining stuff Chris, Joey and Natsuki.. Keep it up guys!
Yup been waiting for this^.^
Thats was an a awesome music video 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
I see a grammy in your future
I'm gonna need a Spotify download .. lmao A S O ... No Volcano 🌋
Don’t understand what Natsuki is saying.
Please never rap again Joey . . .
Great vid as always Chris! Can't wait what's next!
I actually needed this to brighten my day up. Considering you were on a short time frame the rap came out well.
we got scammed!!!!  chris isn't in the rap video!!
Now lets make "Too much volcano" lofi
I need too much volcano now
Was there any way to cook or store food in the igloo domes?  Like, a microwave and/or a mini fridge?  And I certainly enjoyed the rap video. And, for something thrown together within 9 hours, it's pretty damn impressive.  Honestly, I'd say it was better than most professionally made rap music videos over the last couple years
Natsuki should get Chris back by pushing him in the volcano
'3 dudes in an onsen, 2 feet apart cuz they're not gay'
i get so excited for your videos
A - S - O So much Volcano Let’s goooooo!!!
That song was just to good
FINALLY😁
I like that the more Natsuki says Aso, the more it sounds like "asshole"
Don't give up your day jobs guys, though not as bad as Irish banshees, LOL
I looooove it .... the rap song was amazing ^^
i don't understand your f****** joke harry Styles
This was awesome 😂
LMAO exceptional
I love this music video lmao
That rap was so bad but sooooo good I love it
This is such a fun series to watch
@6:10  that is painful to watch
Im so hyped for these videos! 😄 they make my day
Can someone tell me where I could find this rap on iTunes?
And here I thought Dr. Jelly would never be topped. That was a really solid rap.
Its the wilhelm scream for me lol Loves it.
Place this at my funeral.
A-S-O SO MUCH VOLCANO SO MUCH VOLCANO! Such an earworm.
I’ve got a fever and the only prescription is more volcano.
ASO So much Volcano  This gonna be stuck in my head haha brilliant
Spotify and iTunes need To much volcano !!
lmao what an insane rap video, I can't wait to see nagasaki!
It's utter ridiculous how much production quality is in this rap for that amount of time
I want a shirt or a cap with that rap title. How's the merchandise store coming along?
i like that boulder. thats a nice boulder
Yo, drop the album.
That was pretty good rap !
THAT'S IT. You must now end every single JAJ episode with a music video. Sorry, guys—you did this to yourselves.
Natsuki is the one who submitted the “write your own rap song” challenge
I was so surprised about Chris being able to beat box?! What?!
New fancy ringtone. Nice!
Let’s go episode 2
A S O
too much volcano))
too much volcano!
NICE
Another fantastic episode! Loved finally getting to see what the inside of those domes look like (I would love to walk through the village, but not stay haha) and the rap was fantastic considering you had 9 hours to complete it. :D
Shabbing is my new favorite verb lolllll
100% love this series. I wish you could do these all the time. :)
I thought the rap video was well done!
The cinematography and editing are at such a high quality that it almost feels criminal that this series is free to watch. Thanks Chris for making these videos
I thought Joey actually did a pretty great job with the lyrics - both writing and performing. Enunciation was really clear and delivery was very smooth even at pace, which is kind of the ideal combination in rap. Video and episode as a whole were excellent as always!
That was almost good. Joey needs a better voice tho XD
I thought I was staying in Kurokawa onsen once but I ended up off in the sticks nearby. It wasn't so bad and because of jet lag I ended up just passing out early anyway.
The rap made me genuinely smile, great job guys!
Can't wait for this pandemic to be over so I can go shabbing with the boys
Print, cut, send them a Grammy To Much Volcano is pure fire.
"Too Much Volcano" was a jam!
I hope I never hear that rap again in my life. 😂
Next time we need Chris to do a Rap.. Also this is that good it need to be released on platforms. I literally just screen recorded it, since I wanted to keep on watching it over and over again 😅😅😅
'Too Much Volcano' is a bop. Great job you guys.
Id love to see a “Journey across New Zealand” one day
The wilhelm scream in that rap was 🗣👌🏽
This counts as studying for a geography of japan exam, right?
Wait the rap song is good
Chris. Please. Please I am begging you put this on Spotify so I can save this forever.
7.8/10 too much volcano
Please tell me I'm not the only who who skipped the rap because I was already too embarrassed >.<
I absolutely adore all of the cinematography that goes into every series!😍
I thought Natsuki's last name was _Ano_ ... don't know where I got that...
Best video in the series yet! Too much volcano though... :)
Many rap songs inferior to this have sold a lot of records. Good job, gents.
that was lit
The Wilhelm scream broke me for some reason! 🤣🤣🤣
Eminem have been real quite since this dropped
I’m glad this came out best Sunday ever ！！
When Too much volcano on Spotify??
spotify when!???
9 hours to write, film and produce it..... Better than a lot of other things that pass for entertainment these days!
The hook.
Bruh those are the houses in Dragon ball
Goddamn it, going to have "A S O, so much volcano" in my head for the rest of the week now.
A-S-O.... Too much volcano.... Gonna be humming that tomorrow 😅
You might say its bad, but I'm going to struggle to get "Too Much Valcano" out of my head for the rest of the day.
So when is Too Much Volcano being released as its standalone video?? Seriously that was really good for only 9 hours of time spent!
BELL GANG RISE UP
Curious about the song that plays at 12:49. Anyone knows what it’s called because I’ve heard it in other videos and before that
Kanye West sweating rn
Let's gooooooooo
Top 10 rapper Eminem is too scared to diss
My god... Is this song on itunes and spotify?!
Thanks for a fun video guys :D Loved your rap song!
Damn you. The rap is stuck in my head now. I navigated away to watch a Netflix movie and couldn't stop singing the rap that I had to come back and comment. Success, I guess?
Pulled it off in 9 hours but still better than jake paul's music lmao.
I think the hook is the best part of the rap
That rap slaps 👏🏼 great job guys ! Beautifully shot vid.
The houses reminds me of goku's house very disappointed that joey didnt get that
Amazing episode! Should be on Netflix!!  Also, when is the song on Spotify available? Keep it up with the great work!!
abroad in japan. ft Ikurru
Now I will be humming “A-S-O…” for days, haha
Good on ya fellas. Fantastic effort, great fun, love you work. Keep em coming.
Did i like the rap song. A S O, to much volcano🎶 Yeah its catchy. Its probably bad but i love it! Cant wait till next week guys. Thank you all so much for the great videos!
Chris is leaning hard onto the hot tub meta.
Too much volcano 🤝🏼 Grammies
Hilarious
Get that on Spotify that's great.
The rap is very catchy, sticks on your mind
"soo much volcano, no volcano" hits deep man :') . The song is soo hilarious though
Well done gentlemen. I super enjoyed the rap. Hahah 😁😁😁
Natsuki beach episode when?
Excited!!!!
Ok but Joey and Natsuki dancing was literally me in every primary school disco
I see that Natsuki's Bizarre Adventure part 2 is out....  I thank you.
EXTRA SALAMIIIII
I actually enjoyed that rap, nice work
whats the app u used for the beat tho
The rap gave me like early 90's Fresh Prince of Bel Air vibes
Loved the rap video.
The song's stuck in my head, but I don't mind it one bit. Well done, boys 😄
Natsuki's lines are perfect😂
Great rap song. Super work.😎✌😎😍
Well done with the 9 hour rap guys.
ASO TO MUCH VOLCANO !!!! Best rap song of all time I cabt get it out my head
Amazing this song gonna win a Grammy
It's actualy pretty good considering the time constraint
Also if you put some autotune in your voice I think the songs gonna sound better
The song is in my head
Those igloos remind me of the capsules in DBZ
That village looks like a giant fire hazard.
Its amazing you guys have a couple hours to create a rap and its this good damn! Also upload this to Spotify or anywhere so i could enjoy it again please lol
Guys that was a damn good tune!
How come their music video that was filmed in a day is better than like 90% of other YouTube music videos that take weeks or months to make
10/10 just enough volcano
I LOVE THIS CHANNEL!!!!!! Natsuki, Joey, and Chris in same video makes a god tear video. ( the rap song was pretty good Chris just letting you know).
too much volcano is gonna go triple platinum im calling it
Spotify release when?
Chrissss, upload this fire ass bars and official music video separately too, pleaseee! Loves ittt
Good one! 👍🏻
best thing on sunday night since old top gear!
Just notice 12:43 a rock can be seen falling between Joey and Natsuki in the distance.
TBH for a song made in less than a day, it really does slap in a certain way
I love this series so much !
Gentlemen..well you know what time it is. I need an album get on it.
Would give up everything to be in that hot tub with Daddy Chris #thirsttrap
Dr. Jelly got barsssss
Better than half the music i hear being put out, probs cause you guys had fun doing it
I usually hate rap, but this was a lot of fun!
The anime man can really rap! He was even Georno in the jojo rap.
Perfect way to close my sunday: Journey Across Japan and pizza! ❤ 🍕
TOO MUCH VOLCANO!
Me living in America with rising house costs: I wouldnt mind living in that igloo...
Not sure why but Natsuki just holding the wiper of the van killed me
Give more Japanese line to natsuki would been really cool
How did you miss; “My boys and I are in Aso Chris has a face like a Picasso.  His eyes go left, his nose goes right, He truly is a dreadful sight.” Or the classic “boys’ line; “we’re chilling in an onsen, my man x has a tiny Johnson”.
Joey dances in the dome home place were the best. More of that quality entertainment please.
Soon on Spotify "Too much volcano"
the shelters have a dragonballz vibe must visit now
ok actually it was much better than  I thought
Thats a beautiful room. But it's not really the same as pirate pants, is it? Lol
The song was great! Nippon trio adventures!
You guys seem like you would be a riot to hang out with
That igloo village is a peek into the future of how the World Elites will have all of us peasants living. Renting these little pod houses eating bugs. . .         [hides tinfoil hat]
Props to the song!! Also, this trip looks so much more fun and I'm jealous of you guys.
This is better than half the crap rap thats out there now
That better not get stuck in my head     I was in my kitchen less than 20 minutes later when I realised I was singing it...I hate you
Doing a JAJ recreation is now one of my bucket lists.
"A-S-O so much volcano"  bars hotter than the volcano itself
The rap song was pretty dope and it carries the episode. While the challenge was great and the interactions of the trio are always nice I feel like not much happened in this one. Big thanks to the Animation dude for lifting Mr Broad... Again.
Sign: Evacuate immediately. Chris: Alright lads, let's have a closer look.
Each journey just gets better n better no doubt  💯 🔥
Oh wow! This was such an awesome episode! Loved every minute and I'm counting the days for part 3! Once again your cinematography Chris was phenomenal! That rap video looks better than a lot of the music video's of today! Awesome job! As for the song itself, Great job guys! Seriously though Chris I can't believe you made that on your phone! Call Pete we need this played on Absolute Radio ASAP!
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 I loved it guys!!!
i love the rap video, and this trip seems so chill. i want to join in.
Those domed houses are straight out of DragonBalls Capsule Corp house capsules
To be honest I don´t know what was more heat, the volcano or the rap song
Yooooooo that rap video was EPIC..super retro,,love it A.S.O No Valcano🤘🙌💪
Why was that one of the best youtuber raps I’ve ever heard? It was actually really freakin well composed and quite funny. When a song about a fucking volcano no one has ever heard of and forest earthquake igloos better than half the raps I’ve seen by you tubers on this app. Also the cinematography on the music video that went with the rap was a little bit too good for the song ngl. Some of those shots looked straight out of one of those artsy movies that you only watch to seem artsy and like you understand cinematography. Like ahhh yes le grand blue the movie with no plot but oh look dolphins :D
What is the music app Chris is using?
That was the best rap about a volcano that I've ever heard!! 🌋🌋🌋 Thanks guys, you made my Sunday! When does the LP get released on vinyl?
Have you considered a "Contest" for a total "Gaijin" like me to fly in and spend "one Season" doing all the "stuff" that is popular during that Season?
LETTTS GO
Finally something on YouTube
Put this song on Spotify I NEED IT
Natsuki singing in English reminds me of Japanese singers saying English words in anime openings. XD
When can we expect “Too much Volcano” to be on iTunes? And can we expect a ringtone version?
Be positive of the rap song....?  Erm... the drone shots was impressive?  The song was impressive in light of the time constraints and theme so well done  Only recently have I come across the channel and look forward to your next video.  Random qs. Are there any random or ingenious tech that Japan has that we here in the slums of England should be introduced to?
Eminem feal threatened right now after watching this 🤣 "Aso So much Volcano"🎶
The rap more than makes up for the failed first challenge.  You guys need to do more songs!
***too much volcano***
Best rap ever
Not a huge dragonball fan but those dome houses look like they’re straight outta dragon ball
OK this song needs to be realised solo just bc it's funny
Jaj just keeps on getting better and better. I love it.
What I would do to meet natsuki in real life. He seems like he would be so much fun to hang out with
Hahaha gago shabu shabu
I never knew you could have so much volcano and no volcano at the same time till today.  Thanks Chris for the information.
This Rap is for real a banger 🔥😂
That is the best song I've heard in a while i need that in my YouTube music playlist and your editing is amazing in this series so far.
Waited all week for this episode.....love the rap. Can’t wait for the next one❤️❤️
Cool
A S O Danger Vulcano *wilhelm scream*
we want a chris rap lol
Where can I get natsuki's jacket?
I loved the music 🎶
Joey's Junji Ito sweater. I rate it.
Great video. Catchy tune actually.
The backstreet boys of Japanese tourism are back
Great episode & great job on the Rap song 🎶🎵🎶🎵👍
We want the album!!!
Natsuki Aso means Natsuki Dog in Filipino 😂
I’ve got to say, the raps visuals were incredible 😂 the actual music… was… good? Honestly, quality entertainment
Best rap ever made.
So when is Too Much Valcano dropping on Spotify?
When is it coming on Spotify? xD
I feel new
So when's Too much Volcano coming to Spotify?  XD
Brilliant!!!
I love this. Just a question what’s the theme song of this show? Can anyone tell me?
This...song...is gonna be in my head forever
The rap video was epic guys!!
For a 9 hours production time, I think it's really cool rap...
The bloody maniacs actually used salami and tatami.
I just can't, it's too much...
The landscape is beautiful
Editing skills 💯
Natsuki: And TV show! Chris: Abroad in Japan! Natsuki: Abroad in Japan, yaaaa   ಠ_ಠ
Ah yes, THE ORB
Too much volcano better be dropping soon
let's goooooo
That was really good
If they made a special cottage for Chris it's gotta be Abroaddocottage #abroad in a cottage
Why am I getting slight Pink Guy vibes from this rap song? lol  Good just lads!  Seems like a great adventure!
10:20 how people enter a bathroom after some has been there
well that should be released on spotify!
woow really surprised by Joey rap skills! 2pac level 😂
Looks like a bunch of oversized Hobbit houses.
pretty good rap. very catchy
Loving this series, dudes!
Wet Nippon Boys
Yall got that rap on spotify? Also, where is your verse Chris?
Massive legends
something nice
I can’t get “A-S-O too much volcano” from my head.
When Joey said you could beatbox I assumed he was joking. . . My apologies 😂
No Pan Shabu Shabu!
I'm going to have ASO too much volcano stuck in my head for days now
Eruption = A rap song.. get it? No? okay..
I wasn’t ready for how good the rap turned out ngl
Honestly I expected too much volcano to be way worse then it was
Seperate song release please??
That was wonderful and in so little time!
Now that was entertaining :-) That closing rap kept me smiling and chuckling. Good Job Guys!
I like how you included it was Natsukis holiday in the title lol
Started a trip a few years back in Kurokawa… driving the area was also pretty fun, but ran afoul of some sudden weather(thunder/rainstorm)on the way back… pretty interesting leg TBH…
I think I really have had too much volcano.
I laughed so hard. ^^
That rap was surprisingly good and lit
Not for nothing, that rap wasn't half bad. Especially considering the production time~!
I hope you have more music challenges in the future... very well-edited music video... bala beem balla boo or something
The rap would have been the stuff of Gods if you were in it Chris...
Awesome good job guys  Too much volcano 👍👍😘
bet natsuki never thought he'd ever participate in a rap song
More cowbell
9:00 Why is the ground red there?
Natsuki is hilarious!
The rap was great! Wanna visit an onsen town the next time I go to Japan.
A brilliant end to the week! I recently picked up a couple of the shirts from your merch store (2 for fuck sake tee’s, one white text on white and one black text on white) and the quality is amazing 😁
Phenomenal. Absolutely phenomenal.
Well... I guess I have a new favourite music genre...
The rap was actually fantastic! I’d love to be able to download or stream it!  Natsuki brings me so much joy! His energy is absolutely infectious and the things he says are hilarious! I’ve been enjoying your videos and his antics since I was 15/16 and I’m 22 now just in case you wanted to feel old 😂
Waiting for the full album to come out.
Eyy that back beat was pretty funky
How did this not come up in my recommended!! I had to visit your channel after your status update to see it there.. and I’m subscribed and have watched every video!!
Too Much Volcano! Let's Fucking GOOOOOOO!!!!!!
WHY IS THE RAP SO GOOD
My ears have been eternally blessed.
Omg that song was everything I wanted and needed today haha.
Supreme quality rap! 10/10
This is a good start to the week for me! Thanks!
Why!! It´s about 1am here and I was about to sleep. Now I got "Too much volcano" repeating in my head.
Loved the rapping!!! I hope Natsuki keeps throwing in random “Too much volcano” comments during the trip.
Journey across Japan 4: The quest for the legendary pirate pants confirmed?
Grammy material right there.
Amazing!! I stayed up late to watch this as it got released and I was not dissapointed
2:24 graceful as ever Chris
Oh this was absolutely fucking glorious
The only rappers Eminem was too afraid to diss.
holy crap, that rap song was amazing!!!! you should get it on Spotify :D  already excited for next weeks video *o*
LET'S FUCKING GOOO
Japan must protect Natsuki at all costs.
ASO....Oh no, it is stuck in my head. The song is actually pretty catchy
You should make the song standalone and put it on the channel
They better rig the challenges to give a Dr. Jelly 3. I love journey across Japan so much
This rap song is worthy of being on Spotify. Also great job in editing the music video. 😊
Put it in spotify I need it
The rap is better than "pineapple pen"
It's nice to see Natsuki so happy with his bath.. Knowing he's working so hard normally!
Absolutely loving the videos! I would dare say the rap at the end was... peak
Wow...that rap video guys. What can I say but it was F&$king brilliant!
The song was terrible and I loved it XD
I actually enjoyed that rap...
I love natsukish language
If this rap song isn't licensed for promotional use to make the entire prefecture sound more rad, I will consider the area of Japan off limits for travel.
My favorite thing about these videos is witnessing the stampede of weebs desperate to tell everyone how they too are in Japan or they have been there. xD
If that's what you guys can make on a whim, I'd love to see a series of legitimate songs by you guys. Even if they're just satirical. That was pretty lit.
That rap is absolutely amazing! For just 9 hours its great. Super funny, super catchy and the rhymhes are lit xD couldnr stop smiling while hearing it.  I hope you All had A great holiday and natsuki could despite every challenge and random stuff you did enjoy himself and relax A bit.  Lots of love and we want more Raps! The cycle, bicycle, Donald squeak rap Was legendary!
I cAn'T bElIeVe YoU dIsRePeCt JaPaNeSe BaTh TuB lIkE tHaT. iF yOu No LiKe JaPaN tHeN lEave
This is amazing

Mount Aso reelin' me in with a lasso by none other than Pablo Picasso...? Did I do good?
I will now exclusively refer to you guys as the Nippon Trio lol
A S O So much volcano
Why didn't you put #MoreAdventure in the description? 😰
Natsuki has that face in rap vid damn
Too much volcano needs to go onto Spotify.
I can already tell I’m gonna be unironically singing the chorus of that bloody rap song to myself for the next week
"Too Much Volcano" definitely falls into the "it's so bad it's good"category... honestly I love it!
The rap was great! It had just the right amount of volcano.  I keep thinking some porpoise is swimming nearby Japan, rocking some epic pirate pants.
What amazing views, wow!
Music vid was really awesome!!!
That song is scuffed as shit, I love it.
Too much Volcano
Totally worth staying up for, this series is too good
When will be for Spotify release

I don't know which one I'm more impressed with the rap song or the video 😂
SHABBING WITH THE HOMIES
Honestly the rap song was so much fun. Props to all of you guys for producing it during your trip! Can't wait to see what's next.
If it helps at all. I very much enjoyed the rap song
That rap absolutely exceeded my expectations that was amazing 😂😂😂
This is amazing. Pure genius

Loving the trip so far. Rap song was a highlight. Great cam work too
Upload the music video 😂
The rap was amazing!!
its Dad rap, i love it xD HAHAHAHAH boomer rap! its perfect!
Consider the music videos of early MTV; "Too Much Volcano" looks like it has a budget of a million bucks! Also bonus Wilhelm Scream 😆 Nicely done, guys
I was genuinely vibing to that rap song, like I was preparing for something bad and was just blown away by how great it was Spotify when?
Awesome! I'm already looking forward to bingeing the whole Journey in one go once it's done.
dragon ball caspule corps village wow
Yo the new Joji song is fire
Too much volcano, ASO, No Volcano, No Volcano.   Lyrical genious.  PS: <3 Natsuki.
Shabbing?...that’s a first...
Song was straight. 🔥
hahahaha amazing video
the amount of effort you guys put into the rap song was actually so impressive lol  loooving this series so far!!♥️
Whoever came up with that rapsong... Lets pretend it never happened. It will be better for my eardrums and your dignity. ;D     No surprisingly its better than I expected.
Yes finally another episode keep it going!!!
Everytime I watch Journey Across Japan, I can't stop thinking about how badly I want to live in Japan. Easily one of the most interesting and beautiful places in the world.
Let's Gooooooo!
That rap was fire 🔥  Especially Natsuki’s parts
The music video's genuinely really well shot, I'm impressd!
Natsuki should be a regular or something hes hilarious
Where can one get a Junji Ito shirt like Joey's wearing in this?
Honestly loving too much volcano
EPIC RAP. 😂 Good job boys!
We need Too Much Volcano on Spotify ASAP
I really want to go in a bath like that
the chorus will be stuck in my head for the rest of the day so I think you did a good job.
Where do I download this banger rap tune 🎵🎶🎵🎶
I too love the cheap hotels of Paris.
I need this on Apple Music please!!
“Straight outta Compton!” But instead “straight outta Japan!”.. let’s get it.
Let's Get It!! 😁 " Too Much Volcano "
You've been in Japan too long Chris, you've taken on the Asian Glow :)
that was a very well produced rap video
How is this rap better than almost everything getting produced here in Germany?!  Nice work guys, looking forward to next week's episode!
Anyone know what app Chris was using?
love the song!
Can you put to much volcano on Spotify please, I need it
Excellent video,  excellent rap song
I was so looking forward to this.
"Abroad in Japan" is obviously a P/R front of the Japanese Tourism Ministry can't seem to bother to do anything about the repressive measures taken in regard to the 2020 Olympics. It's a fake phony fraud.
Headed on its way up to number 10,000 on Billboard Magazine's Rap Charts!  Congratulations!!!
You really need to expand on this trio to different countries and adventure. Just like top gear or grand tour adventures
Going to be singing Too Much Volcano all day at work tomorrow now. Good stuff
hahahahahaha amazing
gotta download the full version of the rap now
wont lie that rap was pretty dang good
i don't think it's a coincidence eminem hasn't challenged naksuki to a rap battle, well done fellas
4:07 there is always something hilarious about a native japanese saying "fuck" lmao.   Also, in the last episode Natsuki got pushed into the river and Chris got revenge, when did Natsuki push him into water in the first place?
This needs to be available in Spotify for us to listen #lovefromphilppines🇵🇭🇵🇭
I think those igloo houses are from a company called monolithic dot org here in the US.  They use a plastic dome in the shape of the building blown up with air, and spray plastic foam on the inside, lay rebar on the next layer in, then spray shotcrete (cement that can be sprayed out of an airgun,) on the innermost layer.  The result is the dome house that is earthquake resistant and hurricane resistant.  The foam has significant insulation factor, and can keep the inside fairly stable temperature-wise.  The company makes foam/concrete domes that can be an emergency shelter that can be moved quickly into place, be a mansion of several thousand square feet in floor area, to storage facilities for grain and explosives, to churches, to buildings housing indoor pools.   The hard bed and bathroom are the resort owner's choice. I wouldn't judge the dome based on that.
Already can't get this rap out of my head... Awesome challenge, even better execution. 🌋
That was possibly the best rap vid I have ever watched 😳😂🤯👌
Aso Farm Village ♡泊まったことあります♡ どうもありがとう♪
Fantastic!
MTV cribs hosted by Natsuki
Love the rap, great work guys
New Journey Accross Japan with a cat on my lap = Sunday Win.
Everytime joey sees a bathtub he just goes in
I loved the rap way too much
I loved the rap xD
Well gotta say, the rap was better than I expected (though the bar wasn't set very high, sorry Joey). Looking forward to episode 3!
Wow. That was awesome rap
Chris: ...as a 30 year old man...  Me: i'm 30! ... and living at my parent's house. 😅 (in my defense, here in our country its uncommon to move out until you're married)
WHY IS THE RAP ACTUALLY GOOD ...... great job guys ASO too much Volcano is gonna be stuck in my head for awhile
Do you ever get tired of living a great life travelling around to the most beautiful places in Japan and spending time in lovely luxurious places and eating the best food?   While I'm stuck at home beacuse of lockdown eating instant noodles? 🙋🏻‍♂️
For 9 hours, that's probably a pretty good rap from both a production quality and lyric standpoint I respect it as someone who's tried and failed to make lyrics
sad no dbz house reference...
When will you put this on Spotify? Asking for a friend ☜(ﾟヮﾟ☜)
I look forward to this serious so much haha
Natsuki is a treasure, I'm glad he had an amazing time during his holiday
The pitcher Yu Darvish looks like Joey. Anyone? Lol
The rap was so bad. I loved it! 😆
Natsuki's face when he saw his Ryokan room was priceless. He deserves it.
Oh my lord. Kurokawa Onsen is stunning. My envy is immeasurable.
just commenting to help more people see the quality that is this video <3
Don't forget to drop the rap in a separate YT video and drop it on Spotify  4real try it  It was pretty good
I love it!
That was Fantastic! The Aso spirits should be resting easy now that Natsuki and the boys have calmed the volcano.
So glad you kept the theme song!
What are you willing to do while risking your lives for it?  Chris, Joey and Natsuki: Make a Rap video on the top of largest active volcano in Japan. Me: This is some next level sh!t for views.  After watching this I hope Aki and The Trash Taste podcast watch this and get their live reaction.  When Natsuki says ASO all I remember is an image of my dogs. Aso means dog in my native language.  Can I get this song on Spotify or Apple Music?
This rap song can should be added into DDR.
Bro, drake has been real quiet since this dropped
Early gang ~ :D
Glad to see that early 80s rap isn't dead lol I actually liked it in all honesty.
Ah yes the natural evolution of natsuki to rap star.
That rap... its so much better than I had pictured throughout the entire video!
Natsuki: Why me? ... You spoke to a foreigner one night when drunk xD
Man, Dave is so great
Great piece. Good work to everyone.
Chris confirmed action movie hero, even in the onsen his hair is perfect.
Did I hear a "Wilhelm Scream" in that rap?
it's always great to see Natsuki  , he's so fun
Too much Volcano but not enough Natsuki
The best trio! <3
"let go see a fire hole that smells and we might die... yaaaayyy!"
I couldn’t wait for this to come out I’m just starting the video! Also I am in the notification squad so keep doing what your doing love your vids man keep up the good work!
Not gonna lie I would 100% listen to this
FANTASTIC!!! GREAT VIDEO!!!!!
That rap song is what Teriyaki Boyz wishes it was!
to much volcano
Good job, great rap song!!!!
Eminem has been real quiet after you dropped this one
ASO too much volcano, no volcano
What's up with the red lines on the road at 8:31?
I was like omg Gokus house is real lol also Nice Song
I was shocked by how good that was 😂👍🏻✨
The dome houses still remind me of the Capsule Houses from Dragon Ball.
So.. who's holding the camera in scenes with the 3 of you?
actually the rap song was done pretty ok. LOL!!! You 3 crack me up LOL!!! i REALLY look forward to videos from you!!!
Abroad in Japan bringing the 🔥🔥🔥🔥 in the *Volcano* 🤣😂 Hats off to the person with the suggestion!
For such a short time span, Chris managed to compose a decent back beat.
Instead of rapping you were rocking it? 😅 The rap did make me laugh. Well done guys!
Next time I go to Japan I have to remember to go shabbing with my friends at an onsen
ASO so much volcano AH UHM no volcano
Fudge yeaaaaa new videoooo
Natsuki's getting that salt and pepper hair
So good so funny so much volcano
EPIC
The rap needs more cowbell!
And just like that today sucks marginally less!
Too much volcano is certified banger 🔥🌋🔥
I see Will Smith produced your rap song
BLOWN AWAY!!   🤯.    Daaamnm Chris, can it get better?    I’m seriously donating 1k for the next JAJ.  I’m clearly not giving enough for this level of filmmaking!  Want that now or wait for the fundraiser?
The rap song was fuckin' amazing
this is amazing Chris, every time you find so many nice and interesting places. Before I went to Japan for the first time I watched almost all your videos and since then, I have stayed here because your content is amazing and you as well
9:25 what kind of music does Chris listen to 🤔
Why does Chris post at midnight EU when it's where half his audience live...
This might be my favorite music video of all time
Dr Jelly, Aso-man & Chris England
I love this series so much!
I hate how catchy the rap is
let us know when you get offered a record deal
Is the rap available on iTunes?
Too Much Volcano actually goes kinda hard not gonna lie
A new standard in rap videos has been set.... This just keeps getting more epic by the minute....a rap video with Joey and Natsuki in it ...
The igloo village looks like something out of Dragonball. Was it built by Capsule Corp?
Drop that rap song as a single vid plz cuz it slaps😂
the rap was so much better than I expected!
Too Much Volcano, instant hit.  Actually very good work.
Shabbin' aint easy
Too much volcano 🌋
I came after watching the music video
Loved it, another quality upload. Your videos fill my heart with happiness, one day I will get to Japan 😄
The Pants though....
Nice NATSKIZ,Onsen Has a Gaping Cave with 3 Guys in its Hwaaat Waters
Let's not do the rap thing again lol.
19:06 When the melody kicked in, I swear I heard “Just the Two of Us” play for a second.
why is the rap so high quality!? good job guys!
The age old question, was there too much volcano or no volcano?
"Too Much Volcano" is an international treasure.  Top of the charts.  Not sure what charts, exactly. But it's at the top.
That volcanic wasteland looks perfect for a heavy metal album cover
Well now I know what rap to put next on my spotify playlist
This channel has been a blessing I cannot wait to visit Japan once covid calms down and maybe even hopefully live in Japan someday🙏👍
The Sugarhill Gang has really fallen far.
The rap was straight fire
That rap slaps hard! Love it! Will it be available for a download somewhere?
that was a jam
You guys are like the Top Gear boys back when the were young and funny!
Great job fellas! You all sure did earn those onsens!
Great video, well done Abroad in Japan crew, looking forward to seeing the Nagasaki episode.
New favorite rap song!
9 hours for a rap song about your holiday.  25x better than I could do, love the creativity (And Natsuki's enthusiasm) that went into it!
when's the album releasing?
Soundcloud link ?!!
The rap was brilliant man, loved the hook 👍🏽
the song was great!!!! looking forward to the next episode... and the album! ;)
Idk about the rap song but the video was lit ,very creative i liked it
I am without further words...
Great work on the rap video guys. I hope Natsuki enjoyed the over all trip. I also loved the contrast between the two different inns.
Chris, what's the title of your intro? Sounds so awesome but couldn't find it
anybody happen to know what app Chris is saying?
Chris rap background song is lit yo ... Damn... As usual, quality content right there m8!
Okay i kinda regret watching this before going to sleep cuz my brain is only thinking about A S O SO MUCH VOLCANO now ;_;
A-S-O
And WHERE was Chris in the rap huh!? Hahaha good job lads :D
the rap song was legit fire tho..
Man you make my Sundays so much better with your uploads, you have no idea. I am so here for this!! ☕
why is the rap song so good
TOO MUCH VOLCANO, PERFECT AMOUNT OF COWBELL!!
Love the rap!!! Amazing second video. 🥳🤩👏🏽👏🏽
this is amazing,and that music video,I literally died from laughter
great episode, the song was very funny and catchy in a comical way. laughed quite a bit
I CANT WITH THE RAP LMFAO
The igloos remind me of DBZ!
Can we have a too much volcano release on Spotify??
Ok that music video was legit amazing, how the hell did you come up with such good shots in the span of a few days??
Ahahahah the rap was amazing \m/
*that rap was actually good* 🔥
"A S O too much volcano 🌋 🔥"  Now that's a song that's gonna be stuck in my head for days
Now that song is stuck in my head for the rest of the day. Thanks guys.
That was fucking mint, Chris.
1:30 owww little did he knowXD
There may be too much volcano, but there's never too much Journey Across Japan. Congratulations on the series!
ASO!!! To much volcanos
i need to.see these guys rap more xD
Still better then 80% of the usual mumple-rap that you here in the radio. The steam scenes came out reallly nice
The improve rap at the boat was actually pretty good ngl lol
that rap was actually pretty lit
Joey rolling his arms has meme potential
ASO too much volcano might be the single worst and greatest thing you have ever produced.  Good on ya.
People who don't like Natsuki are a problem.
I would buy the heck out of a Nippon Trio album
Natsuki is the uncle that you don’t see that much , but freakin love and he’s your favourite. You even catch yourself thinking about him and wonder what he’s doing with himself at that moment  and you just want everything good to go his way . Or is that just me
That song was , beautiful 🥰🤣
10 extra points for the Wilhelm scream in the rap haha
I want a golden vinyl press of Too Much Volcano with a complete 4K documentary of the story behind the lyrics
The song was unexpectedly super fun!!!!! Loved it! It was awesome!
A-S-O TO MUCH VOLCANO! Sweden approves!
I swear this guys living the life
Full rap album when?
Too much volcano is my vibe of 2021. They looked like they had so much fun making it.
Please release too much volcano as its own video please
Eminem quaking in his boots after hearing the rap
8:48 i like how the camera men have towel over their heads ;p
How is this place not in a Wes Anderson film?
weird that a rap video doesn't have Ladies in bikini's but natsuki is there do it's ok.
So when is Too Much Volcano dropping on spotify?
Hell yeah Chris. I'm so happy you still put out consistently better content!!! Especially since I found you and Joey and other friends of yours separately! :)
Loved the rap :D
that rap was honestly great also loving the new series so far cant wait for the next one
WAIT CHRIS BORAD CAN BEATBOX???
Best rap song ever!!!
Loved the song
Cool rap song
OMFG that production for a rap in only 9hrs. Is amazing! Kudo's to all you, guys are so talented
I like how Chris squeezed a Wilhelm scream into that rap MV. Lol
I laughed WAY too much at the Rap, it was so good lmao
Well that hook is going to be stuck in my head for days
WE BE SHABBING BHAHAHAHAHAHA THAT DONT SOUND RIGHT
u always upload ur video after i wake up chris.. gonna enjoy this video with my morning coffe
A S O so much volcano, instant like
Had some serious Joji vibes in the music video haha!
What a way to both ruin and make my day, thank you Chris and the squad!
Let's go
I need Natsuki to say iconic one-liners all day long
14:44 where can I like the video 2nd time?) Can somebody tell me?
The wilhelm scream made the whole song
Where ever there's a Joey, there's a bath.
You guys are hilarious.
Best part of the week
If I went to stay at one of those traditional inns with a hot spring I would just never leave the hot spring...
I only just started watching and and "So much volcano" is stuck in my head. I see where this is going!
Joey's little dance + the _too much volcano line_ ... If this is not the new summer hit then I don't understand people.
ooo uggg, Everything is horrible. ewww horrible video, The only good part is  Natsuki rapping. Natsuki save the day. . . . . . Just kidding, The video is great. the place looks beautiful. please keep up the good work.
2:08 They just revealed Chris can beatbox like it was common knowledge! Has this ever been established before? You are a man of so many talents. Beatboxing is rad!
Hey look, it's my favorite series back at it again.  Like a fucking magic.
I was going to shower, but then Chris posted.
There is definately something spiritual about the volcano like it's telling you to stay away.
Dang, this goes perfectly with my morning.
please just only make natski music videos from now on :D :D :D <3
Top ten rappers eminem was afraid to diss
For some reason, the Aso farm village reminds me of the movie Vivarium
Reminded me of the Dr Jelly ad XD
All I was thinking looking at those houses was ARE THEY THE HOUSES FROM DRAGON BALL D:
My favorite channel
I have extra bud light
Was rewatching your previous videos CAUSE I KNEW I NEW VID WAS SOON!
Can't wait to see you guys in a karaoke bar together
to much alcohol will make you sleep to much
Wait chris can beatbox wtf😂
Nice
I can't be the only one to think the igloo houses look like the Capsule Corp. ones from Dragon Ball
2:15 I feel like Joey everytime other people are doing somthing cool and I just want to fit in.
If the igloo spot had a local yakiniku, izakaya, and a mini mart. I would 100% live there.
since when can Chris beatbox?! and good lord why hasn't this been seen before or am I just an awful subscriber???????????
Best birthday present ever! You should look into doing some more videos on the music scene around Japan!
The difference between the quality of the video and the quality of the title is so weird.  Such a shame that without such an obnoxious title a lot of people just wouldn't watch the video.
Sooooo. How many volcanos will you guys visit because I worry for you.
Who crashed that boat?
Literally waited all day for this! And it delivered :)
Am I the only one thinking about how there’s enough igloo houses to house a bunch of homeless people? I mean, they’re just sitting there empty! Might as well put them to good use and help some people!
I would love to travel with you
Came to this channel from the first JAJ and so glad to see the improvement on this channel and to be a part of this journey.
I need some of that Natsuki energy to myself!
the quality in these is just amazing
That rap video is way better than it has any right to be. Also, I kinda hoped we could hear Joey and Natsuki rap a little in Japanese, but this was cool too.
Mount ASO is very GASO!!
I'm done watching these on my phone. The stunning cinematography of these MUST be seen on a bigger screen. Currently watching on my desktop monitor and it looks AMAZING
Journey Across Japan? No, this is Natsuki’s Bizarre Adventure.
absolute banger, when's the rest of the album?
omg :D
wowowowoow
Natsuki the most fresh bloke of all Japan
Second episode hype
Hello Chris! It would be great if you could move your upload cycle back to saturday since many of us Europeans are already in bed at 1am and can't watch the video until we are back from Mondays work. That's too much of a wait for your videos! :D I hope you consider this. Thank you very much for your top level entertainment as always!
Hi
What a beautiful mountain
Lazy drip Gang where you at?! That looks like Capsule Corp House in Dragon ball @22:43 Natsuki hangs out too much with Chris that he's starting look a lot like Chris
"like something out of the Flintstones" no Chris those houses look like they're straight from DBZ
"Avengers Endgame is the greatest crossover in history"  yeah ok sure
Idk why beatboxing is the last thing I expected Chris to be able to do
Big PP
Chris a god in japan
"There's a degree of risk, but we've got a rap song to make"  Chris out here telling us what it takes to make it in the music industry these days
A Japanese Hobbit shire.
Im so excited :)
It's 1am and it's my bithday. What a gift. Thanks Chris,Natsuki and Joey!
I've always wanted to know what tat background music is call 2:36 😅
been there, however not the top :(
Warning too much gas is coming out of the Aso
I'm loving these. I know you said this would be the last series for a while but I hope it's not :)
DAMNIT CHRIS, I WAS ABOUT TO GO TO BED BUT NOW I MUST WATCH THIS
This anime show is over 9000
Why do you upload these so fucking late. You are discriminating your home continent!!!!!!1!1!
When Natsuki started to rap, it instantly went from good to...        *Perfect*
I always forget how good Chris is at beatboxing xD
So much volcano!
God this genuinely looks like its shot by a full TV crew, the production value on this is absolutely absurd
Damn, I would love to live in Japan. Would have to learn the language, at least a bit first though.
I'm procrastinating because of you ಠ_ಠ
The aerial shot of the igloos makes me think of macarons 🤤🤭
Whoot whoot
The first thing I thought of when I saw the village was TABACCOTTAGE!
Cool video, but I also like the old videos where you just chatted in your apartment with a stuffed kitty in the back. Miss those days.
Honey wake up, Chris from Abroad in Japan just posted!
I have been wating for so long
I love the MV
The Igloo reminds me of Goku's house.
Man you are great
A-S-O, just like a big asshole!  Stinky …. 😂👍 Great stuff thanks Chris and Natsuki and Joey
I can't even explain how happy I am that this series exists.
God i love that song!
caught it just in time
Ughh please ipload a bit earlier next time! Its 1 a.m in europe
Let’s go
Watching this makes my day great!!
Nice
natsuki is best boi
*watching Joey's video on eating bug ramen when new Journey Across Japan episode drops*  Bug later, TOO MUCH VOLCANO NOW.  Edit: A+ rap song.  Highly entertaining.
Great video as always! Keep on the good work Chris!
It's here 👀 time to take a work break
Woohoo!!! Here we go!!!
No volcano !!!
Excited for the rap
Finally, something to beat Natsuki's legendary "CYCLE, BICYCLE, RASCAL BICYCLE" rap. Hope the Donald Duck noise makes a reappearance, though.
Journey Across Japan: The Adventures of Natsuki
Loved the drone shots.
Another fantastic video.  The quality just keeps getting better.  Great job as always Chris!  Also, what an amazingly beautiful onsen resort!
Hello from Texas!  Thanks for your great videos and for inadvertently giving me destination ideas for if/when I go to Japan some day!
i know my sleep schedule is messed up when chris uploads when im awake its 12:03AM and i got work tomorrow! worth it.
Mt. Chimney looks awesome this time of year..
Natsuki's Bizarre Adventure, only less fashionable than that other family's and possibly even more bizarre. Looking forwards to the rap album, boys!
Hi
Man, this is amazing
Wow
You know when you hear the theme song you're about to watch something awesome.
i gotta see these two on trash taste podcast
Awesome job Chris.
THE MAD MAN UPLOADED
Natsuki is a gem. The rap was great. Is it on spotify?
I'm continually impressed by the directing quality of these videos. The production values are spot on. Thanks for the video.. it was a real pleasure to watch.
I just know, I want to see Joey rapping his ass off as he did in the anime cipher 2020
LET'S GOOOOO!!!
Tips, Websites on how to learn Japanese? I know you have made videos about it before but could you make a recommendation as just a comment or a video? If so, thanks so much! Achieve the rest of your goals, dreams, and aspirations in your life!!!
"Feels like Paris style?" How dare you, that's too big for Paris T_T
Risking your is what it takes to make a rap. The rap song is now my new fav song
Here before starting the video to sat I love your work so much.you are inspiration and bring joy to me in my down days,keep it up.❤️ Your oldie flower from Sytia
So much volcano!
i love it when natsuki puts on his 90s arcade racing game voice haha id pay a lot for a natsuki redub of daytona
I look forward to every single one of your videos and I recently got into listening to the podcast which is awesome, keep it up man love your stuff
what is japan?
natsuki cures depression. he is an anti-depression shield
More NATSUKI!
Thought to myself JAJ is uploaded on Sundays, check the channel, nothing. Go back to YouTube homepage, uploaded less than a minute ago. I'm on that wavelength.
Yes finally a nother one
So excited for this!!!!!
So how many people have now added Kyushu to your list of places to visit after the pandemic winds down?   And a note for BEER people (because I can’t help it): if you ever do make it to Kumamoto City, be sure to check out Brewery KAEN. I haven’t made the journey myself yet (5 hours by train), but their beer is good, and a local friend has assured me it’s well worth a visit. (Okay, you might want to visit Kumamoto Castle too, it’s also pretty awesome.) 🍻
It's always a good day when Chris posts!
les go
Midnight premiere of the next Journey Across Japan, sometimes it pays to be a British insomniac.
I always look forward to these videos 🙏 One day i'll visit Japan
The RAP is worth the like 👍 alone.
"A S O so much volcano" gotta be the best rap line i've ever heard.
Mount Naski
Natuski's pirate pants have probably made it into the East China Sea by now...
Chris can beatbox?!?
Goddamn I'm early this time 😎☝
When you wait until 3 am to finaly watch this
Another week, another dose of crazy and I'm here for it. Let's go!
1:06 is it just me or did I hear a discord ping? (Nobody is actually pinging me in discord.)
Hey, if being a punk rock star doesn't work put for Natsuki then I'm sure he has a bright future in hip hop!
I wonder if any more of Natsuki's clothes fall off in this one? God help us if Chris loses his trousers! 👖😳
This is what I look for forward to everyweek, Chris suffering and natsuki prospering
I watched the 2018 video just yesterday and wanted to see the inside the igloo. It only took 24 hours for my dreams to be answered.
I have been blessed.
Best suprise for today. Enjoyed with a nice beer.
Finnaly i was waiting so long for this now onto the video
2018 Chris caught me off guard.
Yeaa new video
I want to go to Japan so badly
Dunno what's droppin more fire, Natsuki, or Mt. Aso XD

I was about to go to bed but, what the hell.
This was uploaded on my birthday, so this is a birthday present in a way. Poggies.
I hope I can buy the special master edition of Journey Across Japan 32K Ultramega HD edition director's cut when the decade hits of the greatest journey series of them all
Looking forward to hearing the entire rap album: “Straight Outta Nippon”  Feat Apanman and Abored In Japan

Yey
Kawaii chris 🥺
Finally!
*https://youtu.be/V8PzIDkZ2AI*
Early
First baby
Nice
NOTIFICATION SQUAD: How much volcano is too much volcano? I hope you enjoyed our hasty attempt at producing a rap music video. Go easy on us! We pulled it off in around 9 hours.  It was pretty intense, but certainly one of the most fun challenges I can recall in Journey Across Japan history. Certainly much more fun than flying in a turbulent Cessna over an active volcano.  ♨️Journey Across Japan continues next weekend! Onwards to Nagasaki and the two abandoned islands.
