No way foden done that v martíz
Who’s here after city bought grealish
Let's go city
Just come to watch this game again after the Jack Grealish signing video 😂
Foden is the next jesse lingard
Yessir Man City go on
Man City 1-2 red card both teams man
Hmm
How got a red card from Manchester City player
Just look how this city side are young squad and they are already stars ✨
Even as a United fan. I have to say you have to play foden in the euros
Jesus is coming soon He loves u and died for u pls turn to Him
Villa seriously need to sort their defence out. Its alright having Watkins mcginn and grealish up front making magic but whats  point when you've got muppets asleep at the back
Sick of all this rolling around by players.
John stones is an absolute liability.. England will never win anything with him at the back..
Foden deserves number 21
It's funny when Ederson gets called the best GK in the league.
Ramsey got Stoned, while Foden Cashed in.
Foden will seriously win the Ballon D'or
Beautiful challenges from the english boys at the back, proper football that is
Foden is just an beast Should be playing in the euros?
Anyone who has been watching foden over the last year knows that he's signature is the no look pass.
Wow a tap Aston villa don't know what's hit them🥶💀
I love seeing young players focused on improving their football brain and skills. Foden’s work ethic >>>>>>  The man has something to prove
Title: Foden scores NO -LOOK finish  Content: Show goal from two wide angles that do not demonstrate the no-look element in any way.
Championship Cash at his best
John Stones, England's best defender? IF YOU SAY SO! 🤣 😅 😂 Recently he has been defending as if he were stoned.
Foden will end up on loan in turkey it’s just a matter of time
Foden copying Firmino
I was so happy to see us win
My young boys upcoming like Phil foden
If John McGinn was English he’d be getting the praise he deserves
De bruyne on fire now Foden
Where's the close up of the no look goal?
Foden doing a Firmino
Foden is different gravy
Foden player of the Season 💯💯💯💯
Nakamba at fault for the first Man City goal. Just slow. Don't rate him. Not enough quality or depth in the Villa squad. Need to sort that in the summer if Europe is still the aim.
laporte>stones
Is it just me or was Fodens goal not a 'NO LOOK' pass. He kept his head that way so he could guide the ball cleaner?
Sky sports when are you going to put the minutes in the corner ?
Foden what a player
Bit of a reach saying no look goal, I don’t think Ronaldinho would approve...
Can't help thinking Foden would be a great addition to the Leeds Utd U23 squad
So we're not talking about the Rodri edit in the thumbnail? Sus afffff
who else thinks the thumbnail was a bit broke
I have Never rated Stones at all.!?
that was very dumb play by Cash !
Sky sports need to fix their photoshops
Some Photoshop
Foden is quality 👏
Foden going to be the main man in Euros hopefully!
Was that even a no look I don’t think so . SAKA IS STILL THE BEST YOUNGSTER IN THE PREM COYG🔴⚪️🔴
Wasn’t exactly a worldie he just stuck his foot out
Rodri looking like he has scored the goal
imagine this stones and maguire at the euros vs quality opposition
Man City are the team to beat by the looks of things..........(Next Season is the One to watch for my team Liverpool) 🙏🏾💯👀✌🏾
Stones gone from zero to hero and back to zero again this season
Not sure how Thats no look
Stones shouldn't even be in the England squad way too many errors past few games
Just a friendly message not related to this video☺️ God loves you, no matter who you are, where you’re from or what you’ve done. He’s waiting with open arms for you to accept Him into your lives. Please repent of your sins and ask God for forgiveness. He loves and cares for you. Jesus has already paid the price for all of our sins, you just need to believe in Him that he’s our saviour and begin to live right with God. I love you and hope you have a lovely day. God Bless You☁️🙌
Chelsea 1.3 billion in debt,spur 2and in debt no wonder there being quite.
Where’s the no look finish am so confused?😂
Where’s the no look finish? Foden getting way to gassed up
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
The most improved English player in last 2 years. Also like saka and greenwood but fodon is doing it in Europe and domestic. Well guys checkout my channel for fun football banter.
Everyone's talking about Foden when Bernardo was probably the best on the pitch lol
Just like in fifa
NO-LOOK finish...did anyone else miss that?
Is it just me that doesn’t see the ‘NO LOOK’ finish?
Shame we don't get to have a look at his no-look. He's done it before when he looks one way while shooting the other.
Hardly a no look finish. It looks as though his eyes where were they should be, on the ball.
Foden has to be a MUST in our England squad. But knowing Southgate he'll play 5 at the back with Eric Dier in midfield.
Everyone thought the bottling was on after McGinn scored indeed!
Job McGinn is the best player in this tinpot shitehole league
Fair to say we are missing grealish.
Cash’s stupidity surely cost Villa!!! The team should slap tf out of him!!! 🗣💯
Cash is a disgrace, if i was Villa i would fine him and ban him for rest of the season
Gonna be hard for us Man U to catch up now but I’ve seen stranger things happen it could be done if city grab a loss or a draw we could take full advantage
No look goal??
Nothing happened when both teams had 10 men
John Stones shouldnt be anywhere near the England Starting 11
If this isnt proof that city is copying united idk what is...
Who would have thought city needed foden to end there quarter final curse
Matty cash cost villa this game , what a moron ridiculous second yellow
Nothing in the title about villas 20 second goal instead Foden no look finish 🥱🥱🥱
"No look finish" - he kept his eye on the ball.
I’m an Manchester United supporter. But Foden is world class. Looking forward to see him play for England. It seems like he fits in perfectly
Every season he’ll improve even more maybe even be city captain
Stones tackle rash but accident, however I’d say 2 or 3 game ban
EGS: Early Goal Syndrome
Mings watching stones have a howler thinking, o no 😂
Watch El Ghazi go down and then mid fall decide to make a big deal out of it
Stones saw Cooper do it and thought ill try that
Fodens our way to win euros and potentially world cup
Stones really shouldn’t have been sent off, his leg wasn’t that high, me personally would’ve give him a yellow
‘NO LOOK FINISH’
Foden's in form atm 🔥🔥
As if they didn’t include those pieces of magic when Foden brought it down and controlled it then scuttled past, or his turn on the edge of the box, dreadful highlights
"Foden scores no-look finish" - did he? Either I no look or you didn't even show it 😂.
Stones the donkey returns
Very poor defending by nakumba and goal keeper error terrible perfor me ance
Where was the No Look?
Both red cards were unnecessary.
It’s a joke how good foden is 🔥
Sterling can't even get into the squad anymore
CLICK BAIT TITLE!
John Stone and Matty Cash see a red card in the Premier League
That challenge from cash is mint 🤣
I like how they done a no room for racism. And I'm happy Derek chauvin is guilty.
Foden man city MVP this season
Was it even a “no look finish “
He looked tho
Please take Stones out of the England team.
I've never seen something like that in a football match 2 players being sent off on 2 different team wtf
Get this comment to 69 likes
Notice how whenever we are losing 1-0, we usually always end up winning 2-1
Stones is not and never was a good footballer. Simple as that
Why is it so fast?
At least it finished 10 a piece 😁
Foden just seems unstoppable this season.
Hows that a red. He comes up and not through. Aint dangerous that. Basically leg jabbed his thigh lol
2 red cards what an exciting match
After this title city ul draw level with villa n only 2 behind everton🤣🤣 big in the game now
Foden, what a player, so glad he didn't roll around after that final challenge as well, great role model.
People talking about fodens form which is good to be fair, but once he makes one big mistake plastic fans will be calling him bad
Phil foden left Matty cash bankrupt
As long as villa lose I'm happy
Foden will be best in the World.. and it wont take much longer. Phenomenal talent. And as a life long United fan, that makes me furious!
Wow the refs acc made a gd decision with the stones red card
Honestly Stones didn't deserve the red
I can't wait to come here back in 10/15 years time to reminisce about the wasted talent of Foden, just like we have done for every single previous potential England superstar!
Foden one of the best players in the EPL. Stones clearly not thinking with that challenge and could mean he loses his chance at the Euros.
Foden needs to move to be a better player Hes starting to carry man shitty
Quiet on the M6 this morning.
That definitely wasn’t a no look but we move
foden is just pure class.
Also Stones was never a red.
Do teams not have analysts anymore? 90% of City's goals are scored from a run to the line then pull back to the penalty spot. How teams don't know this is surprising.
Stones new he was off it was the same challenge as Coopers at Elland road
Was that a no-look finish though .. 🤔😂
No look finish my ass lol
0:55 Martinez saves the shot. Mings saves Martinez.
Foden is..amazing for his age
Man city are unstopeble
Stones hasnt been at it since Dallas left him for Dead haha
Walking into the title💙💙
These unskipable ads are embarrassing
Where’s the no look finish
I love foden as a footballer but he was there rolling around on the floor holding his leg for the sending off; absolutely nothing wrong with him. I really hope he doesn't go down that route.
That wasn't a no look finish btw
Stones challenge stupid but cashs just reckless and stupid
John Stones form is dipping again lately back to the player he was a couple of seasons ago, since that error for England last month he’s been poor again
If you roll more than three times after a soft tackle you should be sent off.
Foden has to start on the left wing at the Euro's. Rashford hasn't looked that sharp all season, Phil Foden is future world class player.
foden's pass out to mahrez in the buildup to his goal was nuts. perfect technique
Was that a ‘NO-LOOK’ finish?
Why don't u show a close up of foden after the clickbait title
Stones didn't make a bad tackle. he did what he has been told to do, to make a cynical tackle in order to stop a break by the opposition which statistically has a higher goal conversion rate than a more conventional build-up. In that respect it was a great tackle, i.e. it stopped the opposition attempt to break quickly. It's normally punished with a free-kick at most yellow card which is acceptable.
The one week I put cash in my fantasy team :|
I like how Foden just glides with the ball. The amount of control he has over the ball is unbelievable!
Did anyone see the fodens touch in the full match? I think it’s on sky’s channel anyways
I dunno if it was a no look finish tbh but still foden is defo best youngest player in the league
That is not a red. I hate Man City but that's not a red. The game is getting so soft.  Also the other yellow is not a yellow for a red. Ridiculous
Mcginn the Bhoy that got away,ps what a player foden is
Fodinhooo!!
Foden was fine until the ref blew for a foul, then the acting started.  If he did that in Sunday league then the bloke who tackled him would've given him something to REALLY scream about.
People could argue Stones' challenge was unnecessary but there is no arguing that cash's challenge was just silly. If I was Dean Smith, he's sitting on the bench for the rest of the season. He ruined his team's chances of getting a big result against City.
No look? Click bait 🤦‍♂️
Fodens first no scope
This is the referee who loves to hand out red cards in FIFA
Awww city didn't like that game did they... Awww
Man City straight up decided to play a completely boring second half to just accept the 2-1 they had at half time.
John stones is becoming his old self 🤣
If you don’t think Phil Foden is the most exciting English player in the world then you’re doing something wrong
New title - The Yanks decided to make America everywhere - The Arabs oiled the way - The Russians had nothing to do with it.   You're welcome.
Foden is such a talented player.
I'm it going to lie, I wish City lost and let the pressure mount a bit more.
going a goal up then bottling it? Am i watching villa or my beloved spurs
joke of a red card for stones.  Girls game now
It wasn’t no look
No look finish? 🤣 ok then
Everyone focused on foden. But stones out for 3 games. Including the chelsea one. They could easily bottle a few games and Man united grab the title🤷🏼‍♂️
2:46  cancelling the esl be like
Foden should be player of the season in my opinion.
Can't believe how many players get themselves sent off uneedlessly like Cash. Panicking at the halfway line. I know Foden  is good but he wasn't a dead cert to score there. And they lost the advantage just like that.
Phanny Foden.
Eeeee stones looking SHAKEY again 👀
Mings is so bad. If he goes to the Euros then Southgate has had a mare
Grealish LW Kane ST foden RW at the euros with mount behind them and England have a chance
what was "NO-LOOK" about it hahahahahaha
Foden is generational
I’m sure it won’t be the main talking point from this game, but can I just say that second challenge from Matty Cash after he’s just been booked has to be one of the most braindead tackles I’ve ever seen. Had a great season but that is seriously poor.
No one can compete with Man City ,it won’t be long before they win all the titles ,great for competition lol,
It appears after he was in good form for a few months that John Stones has become..the John Stones we all know too well again
Kick off glitch
England’s defence at the euros is going to be a massive issue with slabhead and stones at the back
Foden and bernardo silva excellent to see
Man City come from behind in a early set back to win in a game with two red card given either sides.....
Stones 💩
Wow that pass from foden was class
foden is a class above
If that's "no-look" then I'm the Queen Mother.
Speaking as a villa fan I can see why city are where they are.  We were chasing shadows all night.  What I wouldn't give for a couple of their players.
Foden needs to leave City ASAP if he's to ever make a career out of football...
Was that a no look finish from Foden? I honestly couldn't see it. He is playing great though.
They may have lost but it is damn impressive scoring after 20 seconds of kick off against city
Stones now misses the cup final against spurs. What a shambles.
Awful rubbish commentary. I pity anybody who watched whole game.
Stones has had a good season and all and a decent partnership with dias but it has to be time for Ruben dias x laporte
Its defo all over now well done city another title
Where’s the no look finish?
Keep forgetting that Villa's _and_ City's away & third colours are basically the same 😂
Can’t beat these ads 😒😒
stones can do the epic dance in the dressing room after that game :D
I think city needs Jack Grealish since  Aguero is gettin' out.
That’s what you call not bottling it
Good "No look finish that" 😂
Ahh yes the old John stones is back again showing about the same composure as a dead cat.
Stones is well unreliable
The bigger club lost today...
Where was this no look goal then?  He was looking the other way because he had his eye on the ball wtf?
Mahrez maestro and the little foden gladiator followed by the pitch sweeper Bernardo. Strategy made by Gordogan......
Is it just me or are the highlights being sped up?
wow its still pretty bad how stirling and jesus hasnt even passed the 10 goal mark in the premier league i
Wheres the no look?
The cash one was a bit harsh imo
He does look though ?
Stone is good but when his sh** his proper dog shite.
Where’s the no-look finish?
Phil foden is the most overrated player in the league I could have played that build up pass and scored that goal from a few yards out ffs
John stones is world class? Do me a favour, he gets away with it cos city keep winning
City are going to win the league but nobody really cares..
Foden tucking in a tidy finish like that with his weaker foot?? This kid is insane.
If Sterling was playing this game instead of foden city would’ve lost
Mahres on Man City wines
Is no one gonna talk about how much of a mess that thumbnail is 😂😂
Forden is world class idc there is no better player rn....Goals, assists, corners, free kicks, passes, energy, speed, power, mindset. First name on the team sheet for me.
Skysports doing clickbait caps titles again
Cash had a tough night against foden, but should be good lesson. Foden will be top drawer next year onwards, consistently.
The unrealistic thing is that villa should be 5th and west ham should be in the bottom half
What does it mean to call Foden's goal a "NO-LOOK finish"? When I read that I thought it must mean he was facing away from the goal but it looked like just a normal goal to me.
Not sure about this no-look finish but the ball from Foden to Mahrez was delicious
bernardo and Phil: our 2 little magicians 🤩
Foden , most overrated player in the prem , change my mind
How did steffen not save that. 🙄
No look 🥴🥴🥴
Foden best English talent since Rooney BTW I'm a united fan.
That pass from Foden to Mahrez 🔥
Virgil van stones was good while it lasted.
Remarkable Mcginning*
How is that a no look goal he took the shot first then looked away 😂
Anyone else hoping these Super League f$&$ers lose, including my own team Liverpool, or maybe ex-team?
"No look finish"? 🤣😂🙄 Looks like he a) had his eye on the ball and b) was fully aware of his positioning. BS term for click bait!
Since Foden led England to the u18 World Cup I said he was unreal. He's only getting the recognition now. He's worth at least 200 mil. Such an intelligent player.
Wouldnt call that a no look lol
Grealish just recover from injury now I beg 😭😂
John  Stones doing his best impression of the ESL...
Not much good calling it a NO LOOK goal without any replay of the technique...C’mon Sky show us the tekkers
Lol I just met the man city before they played. I called pep a fraud lol. Check out my latest video for proof.
We all thought United may have had a chance to win the title when Villa was 1 nill up.
Disgusting tackle by stones
The 2 goals from city was class
Cash clearly wanted next game of 😂
nearly every player on the pitch £20m+ .... 1 Scottish player ..  McGinn .... £2m ... probably Aston Villas best player after JG ....so is it English players are over rated , or Scottish players under rated ????
I swear he didn't do a no look
Rodri’s header was more of a no-look👍
Need VAR to spot the 'no look' part
Really good we could see the ‘NO LOOK’ thanks for zooming in
Anyone who watched that game has to appreciate how good foden was. Unbelievable player.
Foden technique like Beckham when taking them corners.  It’s like they go over their standing foots ankle
I assumed I’d see a better clip of this “no look” goal considering the title..
Foden is insane
From gurantee to be in the team of the year Stones has made so many errors of late... Way tpo inconsistent and will cost city at the rate
It’s funny how they literally only had highlights from the first half only cash getting sent off was the second half high light
CLICKBAIT Much how is that a no look finish.....
Man Cities clean sheet in this game lasted longer than the Super Leagues ambitions
The whole team city is worth and it takes academy player Foden to save them got no how many games now he has won games for them this season if it wasn’t for him they would not top
BREAKING NEWS 🚨   CELTIC AND RANGERS IN TALKS TO JOIN THE ENGLISH PREMIER LEAGUE   HERE WE F****** COME 👀
Foden becoming an exciting player to watch
IS it just me thats realising stones is being "Stones" again red cards, own goals the forms over
Matty cash got less brain cells than days the super league lasted for
well done foden
foden is just different
What no-look finish? Lol the english press need to stop gassing this kid up. He is good. Let him grow and stop putting pressure on him.
kroeke out!!!!
rodri had more of a no look than foden
Foden is fast becoming the best English footballer.
id like the intro to be louder next time pls
is cash for real?? clown
The second red card ended Manchester Uniteds chance of catching City.
John Stones reverting to factory settings with the Euros on the horizon
Great goal by villa by the way but City just were too much and outclassed them also shame the super league didn't happen
I was a little worried before the game started. It was a big win and I think it’s a certainty now. 🤓🤓🤓
Cash had stupid thinking
I hope Mahrez was taking note. Twice he passed instead of trying to shoot for himself and both times City scored. Tight call whether him or Salah are the most selfish player in the league.
As a utd fan let's just agree foden is different gravy
All they need now is 3 wins to win the title
What's with all the United trolls in the comments section, nothing better to do with your lives? Kind of sad to witness.
Where’s the no look?
Matty Cash with a proper Championship second yellow challenge. Deep down we love to see it.
Matty cash so dull
Phil foden so exciting to watch he is brilliant
Embarrassing how click bait the caption is 😭 it definitely wasn’t an intentional no-look goal lol
Travesty.
Shout-out to Uncle Ruckus and Fat Frank the PE teacher who are spending their evening trolling once again in the comments. Enjoy the night lads
The Super League wannabes manage to defeat the former European Cup Champions.
Stop trying to hype up what English players are doing for something they're not. It's not no look. Cowards!
Love how nothing was worth showing after the second red
Nice clickbait mate
On what earth is that a no-look finish
It was to be expected, Man City are a Super League side afterall.
How do we know its a no-look goal if we cant see his eyes
Old skool stones back at it again, a mistake leading to a goal and a red card
Foden must feel like he's living in a dream at the moment, 20 years old and is orchestrating City's attack game after game. 100% must start for England.
Mings is hilarious for that fall 0:47
Did he say, "It's a remarkable Mcginning"?
The dirty six
Who cares about a no look finish I do that daily with my brothers plate of food
Foden is already world class. Only better player I can think of at his age right now is Dan Gleebals 👍🏻
Sky post another YES-BULLSHIT video title
England have the world's best young players by a long shot. Bellingham, Sancho, Foden, Greenwood just to name a few.
cash has done faul on Foden purposely so that he could get yellow card and sent off to help city. He is definitely a city fan please somebody find out. His face and body language tells he has no regret sending off. Stupid player.
Foden is by far the best English footballer at the moment, anyone who disagrees needs an education or a bitter vaccine
Playing John Stones is going to cost England dear.
John Stones had just shown why he will never be a top class centre back like Laporte or Ruben Dias
not a red
John Stones been so ass recently defensively. Ball playing ability is still top notch tho
What a talent foden is like
Remarkable mcginning 0:23
What u talking about no look??
How was that a no look goal
John Stones surely cant be worth more than my house 450K The guy is totally and utterly garbage trash
You know i hate to say this but pep has created a god squad
Foden Has Only Had A Few Good Games, Overated IMO.....
Fodens corners look so elegant
FODEN TAPS IT IN WITHOUT LOOKING FOR HALF A SECOND AND SCORES!!!! UNBELIEVABLE!!!
ha martinez
Meanwhile somewhere in villa park grealish is nursing bad shins that have kept him out for 2 month😖
Foden too good man, needs to upgrade and come to Liverpool ASAP
City really need an out&out goal scorer they dominate games and should score more goals imo...
can't even beat Man City with 11 men lol
mahrez and bernardo on that right is a disgusting duo🔥
Ngl this game was a banger so sky you couldve done better with the title
tell me another midfielder more consistent and devastating than Foden this year
Stones is a fraud
FODEN NEEDS TO GO TO A PROPER CLUB, REAL MADRID, BARCELONA, AJAX ETC
That was a straight red lol
Foden and Mount the halland and mbabpe of midfield
Foden will be the best player in the world... trust me.
Pep’s defensive system as been sussed Leeds picked it Dortmund wasn’t smart enough Chelsea picked it Aston Villa was on the right lines but the players weren’t good enough to hold them at bay Smart says he will have to play 3 at the back or change defensive system
City SCUM!!!!!!
John Stones has been brilliant this season, had a shocking game tonight though. It happens, he'll be ready against PSG.
The hype is legit
Arsenal is red City is blue If John McGinn scores, Foden scores too
Big respect to foden, everyone said he would have to leave city to stand any chance of playing, he stayed, fought and showed why he deserves to be first choice
Fans were saying Foden is the Silva replacement, hes now looking to take De Bryne's role
0:22 - It's a remarkable McGinning
Looks like united fans fantasy of bringing it back to the 2012 season is over
Foden is the best youngster in the league after Lingardinho
People compare mount and foden but they should be comparing foden and Bellingham
Ha ha ha its always been about money so glad I am not a mug and not 1p of my money goes towards this circus
Matty cash just showed the world what human’s are capable of when they uses 0% brain capacity 🧐😆
Foden needs to start at the Euro’s! Unreal talent! 😎
Foden scoring with his right foot :D
Foden is next level
What is the point of making that the title and then not even showing the 'no-look' part???
I wonder how long it will take for united fans to flood the comment section, I’m not a city fan I just find it highly funny how desperate they are to try prove Manchester is still somehow red
I'm a villa fan I'm not happy tonight and I'm happy if people see Smith for what he is now a tactless manager I like the man but we are going nowhere with him I see Mourinho and John terry at villa now
Phil foden is the best youngster in the prem
Bernado Silva is such a baller 💫
Just hope the gutless oil club that got into "the top 6 big clubs" in 2008 get docked points along with the rest
Aston Villa without Grealish is like a restaurant without food
At least villa lost to cheer me up
.He might have been seen to be supporting his player which all managers do except José that is.
Foden is the best youngster in the league no doubt
​What a start John mcginn has scored in 20 seconds what a remarkable beginning
I thought city would’ve got battered after the first minute goal
What a boring game that was
John stones really wanted the L today, don’t know what he was doing tbh
No look finish ? Sorry I missed that
Cash sent off, and so is the super league you love to see it
If Southgate doesn't start Foden at the Euros I'm gonna be fuming
baller 🔥
It’s a real shame to see some mistakes creeping back in to Stones’ game after such a promising restart in form this season. I hope he can cut it out again and soon
Dreadful keeping for City’s second goal
Villa leading against city, giving them a game is what football is about. Anyone can lead, anyone can score, anyone can concede, no matter how successful the club is. As it should be.
Foden is just different gravy. Best youngster in the prem. Don't wanna hear mount, saka or greenwood. Foden is clear
Foden has been in superb form! what a talented youngster
Like half the goals in professional football are "no-look" ones why are you singling him out lol.
Did stonesy deserve a red???
Bernardo Silva activating his Iniesta Token whenever KDB isn’t in the team again
Friendly reminder that Phil foden is the best youngster in the world
Villa would be in the championship without Grealish and I expect them to do a Sheffield United next season.
After a tough 3 days for football  We can finally enjoy watching the game we know and love   Where as Mondays and Tuesdays games were just secondary to the big picture
Foden too good 🔥🔥🔥
foden will be city's best EVER.
Man City were lucky to win, had United not lost to Sheffield United and other teams they should’ve beaten, they would have won the premier league easily.
Its unbelievable how good fodens play is
foden no look goal  werner look no goal
Who watched the game live but still watch’s highlights:) Rip Verdansk
Phil Foden is very ugly, but his football is beautiful
would love to see villa get into the top 6
Once again Foden was just relentless what a lad! 🔥
SAKA>foden.....
Just when we’ve had enough of the words cash and football together this week  Matty cash gets sent off  But at least we’re back to normality
Everyone thought the bottling was on after McGinn scored
Foden come to man united please
💜💙 how are we supposed to progress with players like el ghazi,Davies and traore! We need a serious striker and attacking winger!! I know it was against city but come on.....we need to be more positive as a club UTV
Why am I waiting to see this when I watched the game
Congrats to Man City they probably rapped up the pl title now👏👏
*legends choose to watch the highlight instead of the full game*
This will become region restricted
Fodens form lately has just been next level 🤯
Cash is actually so overrated
this kid is something special - best youngster in the league
1st
We like to call it “early goal syndrome”...
