Skidoo rev was way better than pro s😂
I got a 2001 xcsp 500 hot set team Polaris. Limited black tunnel
Shoulda gotten a 98 xcr
I’m nine years old and I ride a 550😂
The Indy 500 liquid cooled high performance twin is the most reliable snowmachine I’ve ever had
well new 850 isn’t broken in yet 13:32
But the only way to go is oval or nothin
Where is your shed in Minnesota
7:27
I’ve been watching your channel for 1 year now I love your videos keep up the good work
That’s power ☺️😊
Can i get one snowmachine
I'm pretty sure there's been 900 triples for 30+ years
FIND AN OLD FAST DITCH BANGER 90'S/2000
I see you like polaris. I like ski-doo
What year sb assaults I am thinking of getting either that or a rmk sp 155
You need ski-doo’s not Polaris love your videos
New stuff is so ugly
You guy should buy summits or make a vid about testing really old sleds like a 1990 tundra skidoo
Which sled was Adam on?
What i would be like for 99% of us we could never have anything but that old polaris i think is a better have cause we arent a bunch of rich kids who never had a new one let alone a whole garage full or a garage for that matter😢😢😢 suxxs to be us
can i have one of your snowombiles
No need to break in brand new sleds. Let’s just pin them to the bar racing
Bro way do you guys buy Polaris it suck you need to buy ski-doo much better
Only 2 good things about winter ice fishing and ripping it on sleds
Old.. Money saved gets u tons of gas and cabin rentals Need more brand variety than just Polaris
I love snowmobiles
Imagine Evan using one of the 1000 thundercats
2025??
I love what these guys do but man sometimes hurts my heart lol pro x 440 is my dream sled...
yo where you live love you guys
So the old 440 kept up with 20 year newer sleds with zero maintenance?
its mint because it doesn't have the original hood on it
Are you giving them away
You guys should get summits and ride them in the mountains
DO a zr 600
should built a mod sled with the 440 put 155 track and greasy tripple and hit the mountain loool
If u want I’ll take the old polaris and use it for aprts and or fix it up I got a 02800 xcsp
You guys need a snocat aka groomer
Yes
Evan’s my favourite
I lived through the 90’s did a lot of snowmobiling. Started racing cats in 2004 - 2017 here in the NE with many wind and championships SX and pro XC.  Iv wondered many times how much better the new stuff is than the old. I know the new stuff is definitely built better take a beating. But the new stuff has got higher riding position I sometimes believe the older sleds were flatter in corners. All I know is we use to hammer on the old sleds back to in the day. Really enjoyed watching this video thanks for sharing.
8:52 lmfao
When you’re ready to ride the Beartooths or Big Horn Mountains hit me up. Top Of The World Resort owner is a friend. We could show you the biggest mountains you’ve ever ridden.
That's so funny I get a ggb  in my elan
Believe it or not loud Pipes do save lives and that's a fact. I'll give you a like just for that.
My last name is lavallee
Day 9 video 8 of watching Cboys errrry day
Let even ride one of the new ones❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Pro 440 sounds like a two-stroke
YOU BOYS NEE TO PICK UP A SKI DOO 900 ACE TURBO R XRS!!!!!!!! YOU BOYS WILL FALL IN LOVE WITH IT!!!!!!!!!!!
Can u water skip it? 0:18 who ever byes it Are win?
Great video!!
Mikes controller disconnected 😂
God is king.
Did someone say BBC
and the ones in the 2000’s got recalled for engine problems
you are wrong polaris made 900cc in the 2000’s
Celsius taste like bird vomit.
I am unable to find the "old" in this video
Good video 👍. It sounded like a sworm of mosquitos when you all raced
This was fun too watch. Everyones balls got bigger when the pro showed up😂
Correct me if im wrong but its not the first year polaris made a 900 cc machine….. polaris fusion 900???
My dad has an old Polaris Indy 700 like a 98 or 99 and it doesn’t work know but when it did he went like 110 115 on that thing and he has a bunch of stores to tell about it and I really want to get that thing runnin again
Love the old triples! Remember my old Indy 600 screaming while pinned
So, Polaris sponsors this YT CHannel?
Polaris did a 900 cc motor in 05 and 06 in the fusion…
My D6K CAT dozer could push more than that😂
what is a swoop?
I didn’t know you could tail whip a sled either!
I love snowmobiles I have 5 of them
Anyone know what winter jackets all them are wearing I like the way they look plus I need a new jacket
Damn those 850’s and that Khaos look so sick
Compare it with a first gen  rev 600 ho
ur surprised because polaris just send u those?
Even is like me to and I’m only 8
This video is giving me the fever. Come on Winter.
yall should get some mini sleds to rip
Good to see you guys following proper break-in procedures!!!
Funniest part is the right guy could still school all these new sleds on the ol' pro x 440 lmaooo  Tub sleds never die!!! Theres always an old sourdough in Alaska who will humble you on something with a carb and trailing arms hahahah
When u guys are all done beating the shit out of them u can always send them sleds to me!!!!
how do you have so much snow alredy we barly have any in CO
nice
The slightly less douche and destructive WD
...so you get brand new sleds in, and jump them, wheelie them and race them (and break them, bumpers, etc)... then sell them as new to customers? (not sure I get that)... First time watching you guys, but if that's the case, and I knew that about your shop, I wouldn't be buying anything from you... Sort of like the Chevy dealer getting in a brand new Corvette, and the guys take it out to the drag strip straight off the delivery truck... and on the way home, do donuts in a WalMart parking lot (or something)...
i swear riding snowmobile trails with friends is so fun been doing that for years. i have a arctic cat 800 cross country but thinking of switching to polaris
My dad owns a snow mobile dealer wright now we sell arctic cat we would like to get Polaris to but we only have one mechanic
pov freebird comes on
Don't the switchback have a different tail? With like a shock on top? At least that's what I wastold when I bought my 850 xcr switchback
ski doo 600 rs is the best race sled
Man I love the 440 I have one it goes 80 it’s a racing snowmobile #15 it’s a hand me down sled from my grandpa and he kinda sorta blew it up but it’s going into the shop in October so it’s gonna be converted to regular gas it has ams-oil as a sponsor woodys too but it’s a pro X 2003 I haven’t been on it yet but hopefully it’s fun 😁
Sick video 🤘
I. An old school Polaris guy, two stroke stuff, I love seeing the old girls popping up in vids, and y’all don’t trash talk in your vids, keep it positive and I’d love to see some more old school vintage stuff, maybe a flashback group trail ride and some ditch banging on old school muscle sleds then a compare on the new rides..
Yall should do like a C-boys snowmobile trail riding day with a fan that would be so sick
They need to put Evan on something newer so we can see what he does
I got a old snowmobile for my bday 700 playoris
old snowmobile is kinda good
r6 swap a snow mobile
Celsius is really good😂❤
love you guys vids
Would of been a better and more logical to compare the new 600 against a 2002 pro x 600 the 440 is slow big difference so this shootout comparison is pointless
first time filling it up with oil and you spill sum for the tube.. nice
“I’m not a race sled guy” your not a anything guy lmao. Your scared to do everything. Your the “quad guy” but can’t do anything on a quad either
If only ski doo sponsored them not Polaris... ski doo makes far quicker sleds and nicer I think
You all should poot sleds as tires on a dirtbike
A second Chanel behind the scenes of building these machines would be awesome
hi im Weston i race dirt bikes and snowmobiles tell Evan my number is 118 im 10. you guys need to buy a Yamaha phaser  and make it a long track min is and race.
i love it when youtubers say my name
I love those old sleds!
almost 1 mil!!!
PLEASE SEND ME A SNOWMOBILE
buy ski doo or lynx not polaris
Mmm chez burger
I love you gis
Hey boys if you want to donate a sled that would be pretty dope
How question cboys how much for the pro x 440 I like it and want it
Should've hit the rainbow at slow speed and rode it
I grew up in Michigan, and my favorite winter activity was riding ditches.
If you boys wanna do some up north riding before the snow is gone, hit me up. I can guarantee all of us a good time. Kittson county MN
let me have one LAMFOO
you guys should inv me up for a trail race
Yo cboys can I get a sled I live in north dakota and I would love to meet yall and I have a sucky 2002 artic cat 600 efi please yall that would be a dream come true
I think ski doo was a better sled back then
Be cool if u guys all used head sets y riding to have way to communicate
pt 2!
WHY MIKE BAIL LIKE THAT ON THE JUMP😭
Two videos a week would be great
Changed the title again 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Put ev on a proper sled
Polaris tried a 900cc years ago, that engine was a disaster lol
Sounds like a bunch of civics racing, except fast
Love the 440 I’m still running my 2002 edge x 600
Take the snowmobiles on the beach
They don't got ur grand pappy's suspension. That's for sure.
Love the videos

CBoys if you can manage it, you should make more content! More content = More exposure, plus it gives us viewers something to watch more often. A lot of people want more I assure you, and more can only be better if you can manage to get it out. :) Thanks for the videos!

I just tuned into your channel,  now I understand why polars will give you anything because you guys are the best
Love the sled videos! It’s about time y’all took some proper race sleds on the track! I’m jealous, wish I was there to hit those booters too
There is an awesome channel that everybody in the comments should subscribe too. It’s called CritterCustomMotorsports and they do cool outdoor videos with a go cart and a old 4 runner.
Should have gotten a 600 to really see speed wise etc
What a beautiful harmony of 2 strokes
You guys are close to 2 million I’ve been watching Since 23k subs
Ben you need to wrap your Huracan
why don't you guys try out SKI-DOO's
Pro xr was better
sick video but pls be careful as what happened to ken block on snowmobiles
The 9R in that race would have been sick. Mountain sled or not
Kens the man letting use his snowmobile
I wish I could afford a sled or get my dad away from arctic cat polaris are great
Absolute banger of a video guys, good stuff 🤘🔥
you guys are living the dream, never get married and have children...  Trust me..
You guys are awesome I love watching
you guys should do a video on a mototec x2 110 vs crf 110
in Idaho
boys i will come out with my rc car and  have some fun.
Hey boys! I understand that this message probably isn't going to reach you because of how busy you are and how many dm's you get from all the other 1.9, hopefully soon to be 2, million followers/subscribers. I just wanted to first say thank you for giving me a passion that I can strive for and a lifestyle that I want to have one day. I am 17 years old and living in Indiana. I have around 4,200 dollars in a savings account that I intend on using to buy a motorcycle when I turn 18. I have no source of income because my parents do not allow me to get a job and work because they think it will interfere with baseball and school. You probably don't want to hear my life story so I'll cut to the chase. I was wondering if you could gift me the Harley Davidson or some other motorcycle you have used in a past video. I truthfully do not care how abused it's been I just feel a need to have one and ride. I totally understand if you all decide not to do it and if so I will completely understand.  If this is something that can happen I will be beyond thrilled. If you have gotten this far that means you have read my message. Thank you so much for reading my message and even if you just respond it will make my day more than you think.
rip kenn block
It’s hard to get better than these videos. Please do a meet and ride in Michigan again
You guys should repair the old abandoned cabin
6:40-6:46🤣🤣
Since starting watching cboys about 5 months ago ive bought myself a dirtbike, my gf a dirtbike, and a pitbike build in the works. The dirtbike thrill is infectious
you guys should race at ERX again i live in MInnestoa
You would see a big difference in tbe turbo at higher elevations
Y’all should do a budget snowmobile championship like 3 grand for the sled and all parts see who can win last place gets peircing or tat of winners choice
Your not a race sled guy your not a anything lmao ryan needs to go
Switch to skidoo

You guys should come to heber and come snowmobiling at Daniels summit lodge

Celsius just got sued for like 80 million😂 be careful who you brand with
There's people like you guys who have a bunch of sleds and then there's people like me that don't have one. 😂
i swear you guys are always getting new snowmobiles
Funny I drive a snowcat just like thay for work prinoth 350
where is big Ken
I was on Pelican lake when this happened all I heard was your echoes!
We all know that the pro x is not the “top” race sled at the time 😂
Thanks Celsius for sponsoring todays video I know how hard it must be losing 82m and still sponsoring the boys I appreciate it
Ken is a G
Love your videos
Why change the name of the video later… the first title was better…
This video had lots of good entertainment more videos like this would be much appreciated
Some shredding going on.
😂that last race sounded like a pack of bumble bees
TITLE CHANGE and Thumbnail!? Re-Strategizing I see…
Mayor Duke and copyright year at the end of the videos forever please
The disrespect to ken block
when you said  “120” did you mean miles or Km
Too soon...
You guys should hit up with Braydon price and ride pit bikes
Do an older mountain sled against a newer one 😮
evans right, he is the best he wakes up and pisses excellence.
i just came back from snowmobiling trip and this is just the best
Ken Block would be proud, god bless his soul
Lmao the 2002 Yamaha srx 700 triple would wax that 2002 Polaris and the new Yamaha sidewinder srx race sled would destroy those new Polaris sleds
Well the 9R is probably the first reliable 900 That Polaris has ever made but back in 2005 they made the 900 Fusion but they blow up a lot so
Niceeeeeee
Am I the only one that watched this and thought, how lucky they are? Ken Block had a horrific accident doing exactly what the are doing...RIP #43
144 trail sleds in MN - eeew.  I guess it really isn't much more than a 137 but still...  I just hope we can get a 9R Indy :D
Hey can you guys like just do a vid of riding trails and Dutch banging
Did You changed the video name?
the sled content is sick !!
Why does the sled evans riding remind me of lightning mcqueen
kenblock 😞
This is probably the best editing video so far the music when their all racing just hits different. Love you Cboys lets get to 2 million!!
Love watching you guys hope you do something fun when you hit 2 million
Love your vids thay get better and better keep the good work up

Alright boys I started watching about 2 months ago and I’ve almost watched every video working my way to watch every video you’ve uploaded on this channel

Can you engine swap a golf cart With a motorcycel engine
What happened to ken , i didn't see him in last few videos
Can u buy me a pit bike
Not to be that guy, but i have all the things you need to be good at riding all the stuff but still u "rent" guys that knows how to ride all the jumps. And 50% of cboys are so scared of doing anything... its so boring to watch
Love the snowmobile videos!
You guys should come up to Okoboji Iowa for Winter Games
That whip was crazy 😂😂😂😂
pov u saw cheap vs expensive snowmobiles and so u clicked on this vid and it is the same vid just retitiled
CJ why don’t you ride anymore
Yo I seen a pit bike with a 450cc engine put in it and thought of u guys straight away youse should build one they look like so much fun👊🏻
i wanna ride a sled so bad. i wish we would get some freakin snow up here in the northeast. its been warm af so far this winter.
That 440 is a beast! Gem is right 💎🔥
I wish I could afford a new sled still riding old garbage
Keep loding up those videos, love them!!
Do the Tesla cyber quad on the ice lake
Step one of building snow cross track.... remove all the snow.  lmao what were you thinking
Ken had a 3 some with 2 of his men teachers in high school .... it was in a news article and on there life wide open podcast ...
Do you guys care about Ken blocks death?
Nice song choice!!!! One of our local artists here.  Check out Nic D here on YouTube!  Songs called bankroll
I don't know what makes me smile through the whole video
Bro this video is sick 🤟👌👌
You boys should buy a Sherp!
You guys are living my dreams!!  Great stuff boyz, keep killin it!!
Check out sxs blogs 1000$ snowmobile challenge

Idk if u guys will see this but you guys should get a bike or something with ice tires, and tow someone behind on the ice then they( the person getting towed ) Let go and slide across the ice
another great 15 minutes of pure entertainment
I have a question, why polaris and not ski-doo?
Hey cboys my birthday is coming up soon can you come over my sled is broken
I love Evan bro
I love watching shit like this like yeah I get to watch people living there best life's n I'm just watching it an they getting paid for it wtf 😭😭
I have that exact sled as a backup sled lol 2002 Polaris 440 pro x race sled liquid
Celsius trying to recover some of that money they lost to flo rida huh lmfao
Were is ken
Tax season coming up, what better way to spend some money really quick by buying two new sleds and hiring someone to make you a snowmobile tracks!
flashback to march 18th when you guys flipped the x3 big Ken said he would take his tesla out on the ice this year(6:30)… I think it’s time Ken
Is Celsius energy drink or  normal juice
I rode my first sled ice fishing a couple weeks ago and that speedometer must’ve been off because my buddies and I were all hitting 70-95mph. And they were maybe 2017 sleds.
you guys should take those to beatercross! next weekend!
You guys should get Cardo freecom 4+ for your helmets
I feel like they are so mean to Evan and he’s 50% of the reason most people watch
Should’ve blocked big ken car in with that snow plow😂😂😂😂
9:50 Ben your forgetting that they made Polaris Dragon 900s but i guess you woulda been like 6 years old when they came out.
Ben needs to stop being a cameran
I thought Evan was about to swing on ol dude for that shit 😂😂😂
I've never gone on a snow mobile but I definitely wanna get one this year, I live in aus so might b a bit hard but I'm not too far from the snow
Cmon boys let’s see the r6 quad
Evans snowmobile looks so heavy
Evan needs to rip the new equipment for once
Turn a snowmobile into a 3 wheeled / quad / dirtbike? Thing lol 😆
Hey, love the videos, jealous of the new Polaris sleds though, you guys are lucky.
Please pin this my gym teachers boyfriend is Adam and her name is Marki

where do these sleds go. You have bought so many?
you guys should get snowmakers like they have on ski mountains and make your own snow
I’m sad that you guys didn’t atleast try the 9r
U guys should definitely add the r6 with tracks in to that race
I see ken got his hand guard fixed lol
You guys need to buy some 90’s prs skidoos formula mach1 is a beast

Dude Adam got on there I’m a snocross racer to look fed like a fun track
7:47 the triple gets tripled
New to the channel great stuff
What happened to the tracked maverick?
Flo rider had to sue Celsius because they didn't pat him 80 million
Always polaris best 👎

why dont you guys take a crotch rocket snow bike on them
Love you boys
Evan is the definition of a wheel man
You guys should build a another small shop on the land so u can fit all the snowmobiles
Yeah mike, oh oh no
Bring Jake back 2023!
I can’t even read de my snowmobile my sister ran it in to a tree and we have a trip to the black hills in five weeks
That old Polaris still rocking
Let’s see a snowmobile tour
Living vicariously through you guys right now. I’m up in Maine and we’ve had enough snow to ride around the yard once this year and that’s it so far
That pro x isn't a real race sled
Even’s relationship with older machines is pretty strong
Celsius is gonna need  all the sales after loosing that 82m to Flo Rida
Dude my exact sled! 2002 pro X 440 liquid cooled. Very rare sleds! Crazy to see it keeping up to modern snowmobiles. Thanks for bringing in a classic.
Wait a new idea jk cboys have never tried that
What go pro settings do you use when recording? I just got a Hero 9 and trying to dial in video quality for riding. Any help is appreciated boys
Why didn’t u put the snow cross pro on the old sled to see how he performed on it hahaha
Love that these guys can get a shit load of sleds but Polaris can’t even sent me the fuel pump todo my Fucking recall been on a list for 4 months.
Turbo Snow mobile vs r6 Snow Kit Drag Race
Capros skis made a TikTok that they made you guys a custom purple razor skis that they are sending you. They look sick
I love Celsius they just paid my fried 82 mil
How many snowmobiles do you have now
Shoutout to the boys from maine from backwoods bumpers!!
Love to see the sled content and see all those nice rides! Awesome how much fun you guys have! You should make some videos of when you ride to town or go to the bar to get some food and walk in there like bosses haha would be cool to see more of that local "lifestyle" content even away from the shop. Like if you guys rode to Zorbaz or something lol. Keep it up!
j’ai même pas les moyen de man acheté un. je me promène quand il veut bien avec un 1972
you're almost to 2M subscribers.  getting very close. awesome video.
Still got no clue whats the difference between mountai,trail and racesleds are lol!
Evan is the man and a true competitor !
Stop with these videos. We know they don’t compare
I have A Cat ZR 800 2001. It’s the best snowmobile ever!
I want a snowmobile :(
welp im convinced to spend 20K on a brand new switchback LOL
Race the 850 boost and 900r
Celsius is the best shit out there
keep the shit up
All of you are savage gotta be my favorite YouTube group💙🤣
been watching you boys for quite a few years. and the past 2 weeks before work i have been going back and watch all the old videos. its great to see how far you boys have actually come. on the road to 2 million! well deserved! keep killing it guys
My dad had this exact sled! He used to rip with me on that thing! I still remember it
Hello from Kyrgyzstan. Guys you are doing the greatest and most incredible content. Thanks lots!
what happen to Jake? why is he not in any videos' no more? Jake with the 800 hp mustang.
Snowcats and sleds....  Be careful boys.
Love the snowmobile content! I'm a Ski-Doo guy myself but those Polaris look sharp!
I see you also noticed the talent of Connor price
Boys.....want views ? ....take 1500 budget ..that's to buy and mod the sled .....she'd do good ....
i remeber y'all wanting 2mil subs before 2023 xD that failed didnt it XD "these are the best sleds you can buy right now" you heard it here first folks !!!! NOT tomorrow NOT yesterday but RIGHT AT THIS MOMENT incase you needed a pointer it was happening right now,
to have friends like this , a work shop like this and get these sleds showing up .. its so sick .. i am a little ky jelly lol .. need to work harder
lol freakin evan . Hold my god damn tea and watch me
You know it’s a good day when Cboys and Jake Sherbrooke upload on the same day🤝🏽🫡😂
This video just made me want a snow cat haha
And here we are sleds dialed waiting for snow.....yes I'm on that f7 ...good luck with your boost haha
Ya you guys are blessed , over a hundred grand in sleds !!!
A 440???! Wtf lol junk
That’s not a pro x , that’s the edge which is a trail sled . The pro x race sleds came with walker susp and multiple heads and you mixed gas with a 5 gallon gas tank . Come on now
Sheer heaven 😍
11:44 ken really has changed! Great to see
Does Evan get all the old stuff because he likes mum's ?
How does this work? Do you get new skowmobiles every year and you send them back?
i have been here  since 30k
You guys buy all of these sleds or does Polaris help out and sponsor you guys?
Considering the obstacles aren’t too big, I’m yet to be challenged on a 2002 600 Classic with M10 suspension. I have out cornered everything hands down and it is decent in the air.
As if those things have sat nav, more advanced than most cars on the road 😂😂😂
When Mike said he took his helmet off to cool off lol. He was low key mad af!🤣🤣
Well when you’re sponsored by Polaris there’s nothing else lol there is nothing else🤷🏼‍♂️
Between loosing Ken block to a sno-sled an Hawkeye *Jeremy renner* getting miffed up by his own sno-cat I'd say becareful CboyZ snow equipment is turning in terminators it seems like unfortunately stay safe keep the good ish up fellaz
You guys encouraged me to start riding dirt bikes again,love the content
They did the 900 engine back in early 2000s. They were a fail.
Common you gust subscribe cause they have 1.9 mil subs
My day has been pretty crap so you guys posting and making another amazing video made my day keep it up almost to 2 mil. You guys are so inspiring to younger riders even my self and you guys inspired me to start a YouTube channel so thank you. You guys be safe and keep posting✌🏻.
It's not a pro x.. also the 700 was the best race sled in 2002...
Living the dream boys
No matter what professional athlete y’all put in the videos, even is still cooler and better.  Whatever y’all are paying him.  Give him more
I have the same sled but it’s  2002 800 xcsp m-10 it’s even faster
At 14:56 it sounds like a horde of bees flying by
Great video boys. But NIC D makes it SOOOO much better! Two favorites!
Went to school with Adam he’s good shit
evan is the man hes so humble,good on ya mate nz
Yes they posted on main
The drag race would’ve been more interesting if the VR1 was a BOOST VS ASSAULT BOOST.
no way you just let the rivot shoot out the back😂
Glad Mikes ok. And that was too funny abt Evan eyeing him up 😂
You guys should put a ski mod on one of your brand new snowmobiles.
NOOO FARE U CHOOSE....
So much FUN .............. BULLSHIT NO FAIR
Why can’t Evan ever touch the nice toys? Always gets the bs
All the sleds ripping was badass, badass video all around🤙
we need evan in more vids and btw i love u guys i can’t stop whatching you
Dudes in the newest and best gear on the best race sled (based on who ya ask, my favorite personally) and they get smoked by an actual decently talented short guy on a 02 Pro X 440 pushin 105hp and shit suspension (raced one in 02). Saw this my entire life racing MX. Money can't buy ya talent.
700 SaberCat is one of the best racing sites
That switchback was awesome stud the track it will help with grip on lake runs like that and that 440 is clean a sled
Better check those oil lines off the tank for a big air bubble befor it blows!!!!!!!!
the 850 boost or the r6 snow bike  drag race
Vids have been fire lately boys keep up the good work !
Such a great video !
How original. You do the same video three times a year. CRINGE
Fireeee
It’s not great to not break in your engine
You guys should go pick up an SRX 900 or a Thundercat 1000 to compare to your fresh sleds.
love what ur doing keep it up
you guys should do a peanut video with evan. it would be awesome!
you guys should get surrons and put a snow bike mod on them
Bro Evan was like 😤it’s on
Love when you guys get race sleds that’s all I’ll buy fuck the new 850’s
i dream to touch one of those 25k sleds i have a few free-300$ beaters none run this year
Happy New year Cboys
To bad the R6 is down for the count would of been sweet to see it on the track with a track
You guys gotta try a Yamaha FX Nytro XTX turbo
They know  have  an  addiction to those
Hell yea brother
some activities are just dumb.
Let's go
We really have a tendency of over doing things😂😂
Sick
Can you guys buy a 4 stroke
what happened to the stuck sema truck being in the vid
Actually Poolaris had a 900cc before with the "mighty" fusion🥴
"Yeah are we gonna go break these things in" proceeds to ride the hell out of them
Evan hell funny this video the guy is such a character! Loved the videos even more ever since hes been full time
Nice to see Ben decided to spare the taillights this time
Love the vids and the podcast keep it up ❤ will definitely mention y’all on my channel ❤
Great episode as always. But then it hit me. This is their F ing job. Way to go you guys. Soak it all in.
I know you put a track on the r6 but r6 swapped snow mobile?
Cboys made me so happy
But they’re Polaris’s….. I hope they sponsored because obviously Polaris is nobody’s first choice lol. Sweet vid all the same boys!
The song you guys are playing is by Connor price I’m pretty sure but amazing vid guys keep it up
You guys should call out the sxs blog guys and race the old snow mobiles
Not the after market skis
geez why is it ken block dies on one of these things now every one is buy one this is stupid
Can I be gifted a sled?😂
Mike: "yeah I'm good 🧍‍♂ "
Love the sled vids
mad respect to the guy who made the track
Dude holy shit ryan was literally flying lol
Anything you can do Evan can do better.
R6 motor in golf cart
Been here since 600k I love to see that 2 million subs, im not surprised by the amount of work you all put into the videos. Keep up the great work
Can someone please tell me what flannel Ben wears?? Looks so sick
didnt Flo-rida just sue celsius lmao
Cboyes r my therapist😊
The video editing quality gets better every upload. Great job
God I miss Snowcross so much! Used to race at the national level (Isoc) for 14-17 riders, got a few championships too, the jumps they build on the real tracks are no joke at all, they’ll be putting like 4 doubles the size of the massive one y’all are hitting in a row, amazing to watch, and even funner to race on. Amazing video boys as usual!!!! Keep up the amazing content y’all😎😎😎
wow the pro was something. just checking do you guys get new snowmobiles every winter and are u guys sponsored by Polaris.
A whole bunch of Danny Duncan's with vehicles lol
Another old vs new snowmobile vid?
Nice sleds 👍👍💯
love the visuals
pshhh get a skidoo!!!
More riding videos that hop over was sick
i can confidentally say that i have found the perfect sled for driving at lake  yamaha rx1 turbo 4stroke tops out at little over 200kmh with 4 cylinders
I'm not that into snowmobiles, but I do like that 2 strokes still dominate the market.
I love watching your videos ❤❤
Damn those six new sleds got to be about 80 to 100 grand easy
You guys should do a video with a bunch of old sleds, like not 2000s sleds but like 1980s ish. For intsance maybe a 78 john deere spitfire for no particular reason... (I defenitnley dont have one...)
What do you do with last year's sleds?
ejecto mike!
I’ve never really been a fan of the new Polaris’s but these ones look pretty nice
Finally dropped again 😅
So sick
Was one of you looking for a Yamaha SRX, triple
HAVE THE SAME GUY THAT DID RYANS QUAD ENGINE TURBO THE PRO X THAT SHIT WOULD COOK
Loving the videos guys! Looks like such a good time. January and no snow here in Pa. Used to be crazy snow this time of year.
video idea for you guys You all should build the biggest igloo and stay overnight
You should take a snow bike on the track
11:15 you already know Evan had to top it off let’s go evan boys
i love you guys but skiidoo is better than polaris
Evans ego cant take it
Same videos every time
Bah it's olny a little  prinoth 350 baby grommer
7:00 you can tell cj and the boys worry about eachother first rather than their bikes and toys. Gotta respect it, love watching these guys!
Boys ya gotta get tucker Hibbert out there
When does Even get to ripe the nice rides?
Thanks
I actually drink Celsius they are good as heck. Sucks they got a lawsuit for 85 million
Absolute banger of a vid!❤
Been waiting for a vid with Adam since he got the smart car
I want mooooooorrrrrrrrre! I like the ditch banging videos
Are you guys riding in the U.P this winter?
Watching the suspension when you guys ride the race sleds vs all the others is like watching riding in a 1 ton truck vs a ford ranger
It would be cool to see the CBoys against SXS Blog, in a cheap snowmobile challenge.
I love watching you guys and I started watching you guys like 3-4 months and I get so happy when you guys post Ben and Ken and micha are my 1 CJ Evan 2 and ryan and I put you guys in  as my favorite s
I thought even was going to throw his hands up when he got knocked off track 😂
IQR!!!
Definitely wanna ride a snowmobile now but we get no snow In Arkansas lol
Sick video! How about messing around on some 4stroke thumpers next? I would love to see you guys handle and abuse those tanks!
Doo a race with the 850s and the snow r1 ❤
Sooooooo impressive boys 😎🤘🏼☀️☀️
love you guys
Your uploads are the highlight of my week every single time lmao
Love these sled videos
When a new video comes out, I love it I watch all of your videos
Always love the snowmobile videos
So polaris just gives them like 20 sleds now?
You’re the best Youtubers
You’re welcome
Where is the raptor video
Hahah I love you guys, but repeat title in the past few videos??? Also, Ben looks fat, but me too bud.
L Cboys for always giving Evan the cheapest toy when he’s the best at any vehicle
WHERE IS THE R6.QUAD
You should do a pet bike snowmobile giveaway
micah is easily the funniest cboy
So cool that you guys get to use all the latest stuff
“The 850 boost adds more boost the high you get in elevation” 😂💀
Fire let it snow
The “cheap” sled is my daily driver lol
that "yeah im good" after the eject was so casual
2 millions subs is on the horizon
Song is Bankroll by Connor Price. Lit songs yall use!
Awesome video boys 🤟
Congrats on almost 2 mil
Finally evan on a newer sled!
I hope you guys do a snow house again this year.
Glad to see you guys riding the best and wearing the best!
No hate but they think that Polaris is a the top when skidoo beat them
Amazing vids boys
Cboys never disappoint with sled content!!
I gotta get me some new sleds if I can get the money to do so!
You guys should buy the oldest sleds you can find of ski doo, Polaris and arctic cat and compare them.
Excited to see what that 9R can do, and how it compares to the old 900 RMKs...
Just an idea moving the subtitles up just a tiny bit more so if people are watching the video in full zoomed in screen on iPhone they won’t get cut off on the bottom…. Keep up the good work. Love you guys.
Nothing beats a good snowmobile video from the Cboys but also love the mountain contest
Bro yall needa do a “Who can jump the furthest on a snowmobile” vid out of all the cboys
W video!
Those pro x chassis are pretty sick honestly.  An iq would be sick too.
Boys I have been waiting for this day, you uploaded a banger on my birthday I’m 17 today love the vids and podcasts
snowmobile mike sending in to orbit
"the old 440" fucker is born after it. Man you guys make me feel old lol
Ken be like yall have burnt my eye broke my neck go ahead and hurt yourself by grinding my sled
Why don't you guy ride artic cat
That turbo sled looks to be the exact same model as the one that killed Ken Block, be careful y'all.
SNOCROSS MIKE!!!!
These comparisons are so much fun to watch. So cool to watch locals succeed like this. Keep kickin ass fellas!!
Love your guy's content! My dream is to do exactly what you guys do. Keep it up!
I’m kinda sad that y’all didn’t line the old sled up with the rest at the end even though it would have got gapped
I would love to see you guys by the new 2023 turbo vs ski doo 550 fan rotex
Somebody said ggb he said y’all are legends
You guys should take the water cross sled on the snow keep up the amazing content I'm so excited for the boys to hit 2m I've been subscribed since you guys had 150k
Can’t wait till you hit 2 mil
nice vid btw i think that a behind the scenes channel would be sick heard u guys talking about it on the pod
I hope the Boys got paid for that Celsius ad.
oh now nice to buy a new snowmobile every year
Skidoo has the best race sled
It sounded like a bunch of angry bees😂
boys needa snow cat
Love the conner price music
You guys should keep atleast one of those 600R's and build a snocross mod sled out of it
Loved the snow drag races! Those sleds are wicked
you guys need to do a stock vs can sled comparrison
good video
Dam that’s a fleet of snowmobiles boys hell yea love the snow booters
I love when Evan gets jealous...lol.  He hates when another pro is around.
rip ken block
You boys always make my day! Keep it up man! Much love from the Yukon
Hate to burst your bubble here but swapping the stock exhausts on the sleds you are probably losing horsepower. FactoryPipe makes all of the polaris exhausts and they used to be an aftermarket exhaust company but Polaris uses them now for their oem because their exhaust systems are just that good.
Cheap or expensive, they can still destroy them.
Great video boys
These new vs old videos are pure gold
I love your videos
Boys we need more sled videos!!! Pump em out ehhh!😉
I think y’all should make a c boys tv blog channel, I love y’all’s videos and find them really entertaining I’m sure me and whole bunch of others would watch y’all’s vlogs
Adam Peterson is my gym teachers bf
lets go boyys
The 440 is so sick
crazy sick!!
Love these snowmobile vids
what happend to the stuck truck on cboys story???????
I haven't ridden a snowmobile in 50 years! Think about that lol
LOVE THE VIEDS
dont know about Polaris being top tier lol
The best sled is summit 850
can i get a piter
Limo on thin ice
hell yh
I had a couple 02 mxzx 440's and my iqr what I liked is when I would jump stuff I feel the clutch or something would help break in the air
Wow ev is still riping
Evan needs a little help getting over his jealousy of someone else being in the spotlight 😂
"It's amazing how many celebrity legs this snow cat can mangle in just one swoft"
the amount of times ive seen people do burnouts where the tires or track probably throw some mad rocks into parked cars lmao
Waffle House has a new host
Give one of those sleds away!! I need to buy some merch!
Dude I have the same x edge but  a 600 but mine was 800 bucks
I was wondering if you guys know or if Adam knows who Jay from Jays Power Center in Wi because he is also a snow cross racer and he is I think first? I know him because he sponsors me because I ride dirt bikes
My parents told me that as a baby I fell asleep while we were riding around on a snowmobiles up north with me sitting in between my dads legs. Part of me looks at you guys hitting jumps and thinking, was I the chosen one who never fulfilled his powder shredding potential? Maybe... but for now I'll just live vicariously through this content.
Love you cboys!!!❤
That cat c9 in the snowcat sounds so damn good
This video is the sweetest video i’ve ever see on this app. Nice job boys. I’ve been watching this channel for sooo long and it’s amazing too see how far you’ve come
If you have any older 340 or 440 hit me up
Evan was the most necessary person you could have added to the cboys
They get new snowmobiles every year 😅
I just got a foot of snow! Really wish I had a snowmobile they’re so cool!
Those little edge chassis pro X's were fun sleds to rip around on in the early 2000s, but I wanna find a gen2 800 xcr for trail riding. Anybody got a lead on one?
should’ve got a snowpro
Great video guys
We need some mountain vids
The Arctic cat 440 snow pros were so much fun.
CJ with facial hair scares me
-  👍 👍 🔧 -                                👀❤🤍💙
All those sleds are fkn insane! You don't need that many! Send me one!!!!! I'd take the old 440!
Awesome video dudes!
Post more videos cboystv
Me and my brother own a blue 440 and you gatta say those 440 are pretty af
Brother nothing like banging Minnesota Ditches!!!
This is epic you guys should show more of the prossees of building the tracks and things maybe on a second account
6.50
I watch all your vidEos... lol nEw track
Evan is my spirt animal
2M coming soon! great vid boys.
Connor Price is the best artist.
Wish you guys would put more vids out like you use to
Love the sledding vids! Keep em coming! You should line up the 850 boost and the 900🫢
Damn those drag races would be so much fun.  And it sounds awesome
It’s always a good day when c boys uPload
Good job man I love it Good job I love the videos
Awsome video guys I just got a new snowmobile a 2003 Arctic Cat Z570
I just looked a snap this is sick
So fucking solid!
Cj where's the enthusiasm in that advertisement sponsorship thingymabober🤣😂
Y’all deserve more subs I love your crazy good content  you are so happy wish I was there with y’all😃😃
coming from someone that knows nothing about snowmobiles id love to see a breakdown video on the differences in these machines.
omfg ive been super happy and satisfied but angry at the jealous at the same time cause i can't get one
Betttt
Love it keep up the good work
Peanut butter and jelly over here…
You need to get Tim bender out there to show you guys how yahama  kicked ass in the 90's
Need some cats in the line up 🐈
You should do a snowmobile collection video!
Tug of war the sema truck and the Cummins
Evan needs to give Snocross a try.
cool video boys!!!
Thank you for living my dream for me 😂
another BANGER
Ski-Doo vs Polaris?
No wonder Jeremy Renner had to get his cock amputated
you should do a snowmobile give away
Boys I have to stop watching ur videos to quick cos then I have to wait ages for the next post amazing video boys
In the summer jetski over rainbow rail 😂😂😂😂😂
Great vid
Who’s sled is paid for?🙋‍♂️
Hello 🌝
Do artic cat next for the cheapest and new sled video
love it
Ya'll need to put Evan on an oval sled ASAP
cheap vs expensive? old vs new..
You should get a pro xr it’s the actual racing version in the pro xr
(:
More videos of you guys messing around on the sleds !!!
Please just be safe, snowmobiles just scare the shit out of me
tell evan to give me my tattoo already!
So how easy is it to buy a race sled? I thought it was kind of tough. The sleds I would want are probably not for sale, decades later (the oval racers from 1978-ish heydays. )
Ahh yes Ben first time Polaris made a 900 snowmobile…. We just don’t talk about the old 900 lol
What id do for even just one day out with you guys, looks like a blast out there
New meaning to "break in" period, lol
Yo i love these videos!!just bought myself s lynx rave 600 and im obsessed with sleds❕love from finland❤️
Do another merch drop
E
Sub
I FUCKEN loved my 03 pro x 800… I beat that thing so hard it’s tongue was always hanging out🤣
Lets get these boys to 2 Million!!!!
Over 10% user engagement is wild
Love the snowmobile content. Wish we got good winters here in upstate New York
Get some dynoports. None of that ggb cheap stuff.
You guys should do the r6 on the rainbow
Post more
When we riding together??? 😁
BEN SHAVE PLEASE
You guys should try oval racing snowmobiles
That’s it…You guys are clearly making too much $
I love your guys videos
This is so epic
That last race the 600r was spinning like crazy I’d like to see a race on groomed trail
serious question, how you get sponsored by polaris?
5M by end of year?😂😂
Ken is the best
i have the skidoo mxz 600rs 2022 race sled 🤯
A 440 come on. Ateast get a ski doo mxz or summit. 440 is going to have exactly half the chance or a third of a 850 turbo
Getting them tax write offs in early this year
God I love you guys!
You guys should get ski doos next year
You guys should get a 700cc ktm and make it into a snow bike  Then turbo it  Maybe  Lol
Not the best ski doo 583
Send one my way so my step daughters and I can ride!
Polaris made a 900 before it was the Fusion they were junk I think they were only sold for 2 years then discontinued.
marrt me
tough time for a celsius sponsorship 😅
It would be fun to see you switch, the engine and all of the hardware that makes it run between the old and newEr snowmobile’s and see if the new ones still runs better with the old engine than the old one does with the new engine
12:00 yall the same person 🤣
I just blew up my snowmobile and I’m so sad😢😢😢❤❤ Love you guys
The ProX 440 was a nice snowmobile for its time! I had one and it was fun!
I love it when there is a guest and Evan gets outshined because then he gets a little jealous. Hope you guys do a ride out on the first Saturday of February.
Great video,  where is the r6 Quad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Great vid boys
We need more videos
i just watched adam race in canabury mn last weekend
Polaris the best race sled? Must be why skidoo wins all the championships
440 was not top of the line. smh should have got a 600 or 800
Come to hollister SRVA
Best. I’d yet keep up the work boys
2 MIL SO CLOSE
When’s the r6 raptor vid coming out
Hate to break it to ya but back in late 90's early 2000's the ZR was top dog. But still interesting to see old Polaris against new Polaris.
Tboned a tree with my 583 today haha. So i gotta get it fixed now to get to doing this
Hi:)
yoooooo
yoooooo
Pls can we get 25-30 minutes videos constantly. Like with more of the monotonous stuff. Love anything y’all put out
so hyped to see what kind of content you can make with these sleds me and my siblings always watch you on the way to and from the snocross track great to see you guys back on race sleds
One hunnid
I just bought a 99 Polaris mod sled and rewatched all the old vs new sled vids yesterday than this came out which just tops it off

Yo, just please can you not make a snowmobile video please

Meh.. thanks mike for sending it! That was by far the best part.
you should send a sled down to Montana so I can ride snowmobils.
Always have loved your videos keep up the great work
Been waiting for another video been binge rewatching stuff
Poor Evan 😂
This was one of my favorite videos . Looks like so much fun
So do you guys get to keep the snowmobiles for a year? or are they yours for good? What's the deal with your polaris partnership? Would love to hear more about it on the channel or the podcast.
NEED THAT 2 MILL
Your the best YouTube channel ever ❤
Mad love it
Love the vids boys!
It's a good day when they upload

Hell yea!!!! Love snowmobile content! Keep it coming!!!
Love the long video
we need longer video man
Who else just skips through the promotion part cause you can’t wait to see the video 😂😂

I have a question: why do you guys take days to upload.

If you guys get 50k likes you should by a new seam truck
Bro everyone was so concerned for mike after he failed the jump and he’s just like “yeah I’m good” in the classic Micah voice. 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Finaly there are back!!
Been anxiously waiting for new CBoysTV content! I was having CBoysTV withdrawls..
Hell Yeah! This has got me all jazzy! I love snocross! I was just at Canterbury Park for the races last weekend. They were awesome! Your guys sled quantity is awesome!  Are you guys thinking about another winter meetup/ride?
You guys should do a Polaris vs a bombardier. Could bet allot that a gen 5 brp would reck a Polaris
Great video when they get new sleds
Snow cats are so fuckin cool
Screw homework Cboys just uploaded.
Always make my Thursday better thank you boys!!
Hi

You guys have really turned the shop into a Polaris dealership lol.
You should collaborate with Whistlin diesel

Legendary
Celsius better hope to make money to catch back that 82m loss
Tell ez to off road his raptor to that vid well so good😎🤔
Stop fucking buy new sleds and missing the entire snow season because you guys are too good to keep a sled for 2 years. Not a single snowmobile trip uploaded from you guys this year.
I love Thursdays.
Nice
I’ll say that 440 was doing good keeping up with those 800R’s
It’s a good day when cboys upload
I love you vids
Riding videos are the best
Are you gonna show a video of your new dirtbike

Crazy to see these fellas grow how much they have grown. The sky’s the limit boys ❤️

You guys need to go pro.
they also have the 700 long trck which would have been way better

You guys should do a off-road with the red ranger

Boys are about to hit 2M! You all deserve it, Been around since 40k and knew this would come for you all! Down to earth guys with great content.
Do brand new sleds still have a timing clock on breakin?   My 02 took about 90 miles before the computer unleashed the beast.

You gotta love the old sleds!!
You guys should get cardo freecom 4+ for your helmets
Cboys by far make the best snowmobile content.
