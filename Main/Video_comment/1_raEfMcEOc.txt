It's not like watching Brazil hahaha
Lekker Luís ga zo door topper 😎
Sinisterra future Liverpool player
What a goal from Sinisterra btw. Amazing dribbling from him,and that shot was the best this season by far.
Klich show!!!!
Can’t drop Harrison from the left until he gives you a reason too. And I doubt sinisterra came to the club to play on the right. It will be interesting to see how marsch plays it. I’m a bit concerned with our lack of depth on the right. Pre-season talk was james was working on playing on the right. But in my opinion james isn’t up to it. I’m still furious we spent 30 million on him.
Marsch has done the right thing bringing Sinisterra back slowly from injury but man it’ll be good when he’s fully up to speed and playing regularly in the league!
still don't believe in Jesse (it's a joke, helps winning) MOT
Come on Sini, Come on Leeds!
Joffy  doing some great work, deserved a goal, Sinisterra looks the business as well
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
SINIIIIIIIIII 🐐 From Rotterdam
leeds foul so much
gelhart was the star of the third leeds goal
Rodrigo  Harrison.        Aaronson.             Sinisterra              Roca.                    Adams Struijk  Llorente.      Koch Nissan                        Meslier  That team will cause fits all season, James summerville Bamford when he's back as super subs.
😲 Sinisterra is awesome
Gelhart and Sinister were outstanding 🦾🦾🦾
💉🫀💀💰👀
Klichy: "Bob, look at me now... Look at me now" 😂😂💛💙
Que golazo grande Luis sinisterra ☺️❤️⚽🏆🇨🇴
💉💀💰 💉💀💀💰 💉💰💀💀👀
Can’t believe we conceded from the ref saying a tackle was a foul and also they handballed it inside the box
I think when Jesse was first appointed he didn’t have much of a feel to the club. But now that he’s more connected with them they are doing amazing
Que gran partido hizo Sinisterra, de a poco recupera su nivel, tiene mucho por dar aún, es un crack 🇨🇴⚽
Good to see ‘Kleesh’ score a couple of goals
Forshaw was awful, gave away a penalty and the free kick which they scored from. Glad we have Roca and Adams in midfield.
Sinisterra MOM🙌
Sinistara in my opinion is a good signing for Leeds
I remember when barnsley took chelski out 6.0 so I knew was going be hard night lol
So much better now, being picky because the defence was patchy. Not sure what question Cooper is the answer to and was he not given the captains band.
Architects of our own downfall !!! Missed pen to go 2-2 then fuck about with the ball in our own penalty area for the Leeds 3rd!! Typical shit Barnsley.
ALAW 💛🤍💙👊🏻
LOVE THIS CLUB 💙💛💙💛
Why only 1 point of view? No cameras on the stadium? The replay is always from the very same POV :(
All I want to see is the fight that kicked off on pitch between the players can’t seem to find it nowhere
Good Game..great save.. Melier brilliant. Team effort great with obvious stand out from Klich, sinisterra... Great.
Wow Wow Goal Goal and win, its was crazy can win and make many goal even in carabao cup
Sinisterra is such a good player for Leeds 🔥🔥
Excited to see what Sinisterra can do in the Prem. Much potential there.
I was lucky to be at elland road for this and what I did not like was what their left winger did to Cody drameh, who I think was one of the best players of the match. Look up leeds vs barnsley fight to try find it.
Great match for Leeds and excellent performance of klich!! In love with this season of the peacocks
Another good win,.    Well done lads,. Let's keep it going
We've missed midfielders chipping in with goals
If we get rid of Dan James, I would DEFINITELY play Crysencio Summerville in the first team. He is good enough for sure.
Whe gonne miss sinisterra at Feyenoord but he is at a good club i am happy for him that he can chase his dreams
🍑🔥
VOILA
Klich 🇵🇱❤️❤️
Leeds United playing some first class football Sinisterra what a goal the lad will only get better pleased klichy got a couple of goals I do hope klichy stays with us works hard the whole team All playing and fighting for each other. Well done Jesse got the whole team ticking over well & playing some slick football onwards and upwards All Leeds aren't we, marching on together 🦚🇮🇨👊🤍💛💙
KLICH ZAJEBISTY!❤️POZDRO POLACY!🇵🇱
3 seems to be the magic number around here and I’m here for it 💛💙
The ref was a joke last night. The free kick and pen was absolute nonsense! There was nothing in it at all!!
Our new signing clique lol. Why do we never know how to pronounce foreign names ?
Klich proffesor! Good luck Mati hope you be play more every game! Hello from London from old friend from MKS
Klich Poland :)
I'm not 100% sure but I think that was our biggest home attendance for a cup match since 2003.
Sinistera put on a great show... and that name too!
Very brilliant, alot of creativity
Klichs goals are both ice cold🥶
Have missed Klich scoring, he was lethal for us during the championship win.
Sinesterra is extraterrestrial
Leeds on fire this season good luck to them from a mag
Summerville had a really really good game
Solid professional performance, given the fact that there were 9 changes from the Chelsea rout, it was obvious that there would not be such a fluid performance with new faces starting for the first time. One or two shaky moments in defence, however overall you would dispationately give Leeds a solid 8 on their performance which then gives the fringe players another crack against Wolves, whilst keeping the main bulk of the first team fresh for Brighton this coming weekend!!
Klich's goal is calm
Gelhard had open net space yet he tried to pass back 😒
If only Klich could shoot, with his placement he would be a baller
Man of the match - Mathews Klich
sinisterra was reigning over every opponents resulting in three goals, Barnsley goal was beautiful one, third goal - Tackling by Gelhardt,high sprint by sinisterra,backpass by Summerville and beautiful placing from Klich, wonderful team Goal 🤍💙
klich is become a Hernandez for us, I wanna see him play the last 25mins for us at least every game
Good win, these cup ties have the potential for an upset, especially derby's, we have slipped up so many times. We now look like a side that plays well and wants to win.
The Dingle derby
The third goal was yet another reward for the relentless press of Leeds United. Is there a running tally for goals scored after winning the ball deep in the attacking third? It seems like the Leeds lads are doing it at least once per game this season. The whole squad is bought in to the Marschball philosophy, and so far so good.
It was my first game at elland road in 10 years. Was not expecting the volume
How did greenwood become so Old
I'm liking the look of the squad. Plenty of pace, enthusiasm and depth in all positions. Another couple of signings would be nice just to shore up things for a long tough season. ALAW. MOT.
Can't wait for sinisterra's talent to be unleashed in league games.
7:15 Peter Parker!!
How’s Greenwood doing at Leeds?
summerville and sinisterra class players, solid game from klich, hjelde good prospect, drameh not good enough at all.
Que si que no its luis sinistera
Barnsley league 1 but still looks like Leeds played some great football there!
1:33   Green Wood???
And they doubted the American man
Klick barley scores but scores some bangers
Klich 🇵🇱 Boss🥸
Wow, a continuation of a good start to the season by Leeds. A regulation win in the Carabao Cup. The type of game we would made hard work over the last few years. MOT.
Sinisterra man of the match by far, miles and away best player on the field today. Wish his team trusted him with the ball more, he was wide open on several occasions.
Poland ALL DAY
Yo that Sumerville kid and Sinister holy sht …. Leeds can’t definitely be a top 10 team the next 2-3 years, before all the big teams start buying them all off. I’d say that if Leeds can get Vazquez from MLS, oh shit would that be wild. Vazquez needs to talk to his agent to hav a talk with Jesse and management on how to bring him to Leeds. My boy is 6’3 200lbs of Californian muscle lol
Chant for Sinisterra  “🎶 Sinisterra du-du-du-du 🎶”
sinisterra good signing
I've heard that Sinisterra is the best winger in the Dutch league in years. He made a difference in this game. I'm glad he's with us today. And he seems to be showing it now 💪
Defense lookin kinda shaky ngl
1/16 Final, Wolves-Leeds; A tough competitor; Victory to Leeds, fan
I was there
I’m impressed with how sharp Klitch looks so far this season. He’s had a quiet couple of seasons but he looks like he might be productive again this season.
Was this available to watch live anywhere?
Leeds tendency to let the opposition back after going ahead is slightly concerning
3 today, 3 tomorrow... 3 for....
Can you stop putting the line up in numerical order? Confusing as fuck man😂
Smallville does not deserve the no.10 I.Sarr does!!! Sign him we need a new striker
Klich is scoring goooaaalllssss
A good result for Leeds, but as we see it's not as easy to score 3 goals and keep a clean sheet against bigger clubs like Barnsley
Go...Go..Leeds ✌️✌️👏👏MOT 👍Jorge/Asu-Py
Sinisterra🥵🥵🥵🥵
Wow gol sinisterra

Su.merville, like the way he played. 👍
Seems like Leeds actually has quality depth now.  Summerville stood out to me.
You can certainly see the difference from last season when Leeds was only 3 points better than Burnley.
Saludos desde Colombia Dios los bendiga Amigos
For Klich second goal was that a cheeky back heel pass to him from Summerville?
Amazing Sinisterra!!
Love he's playing the kids. Sinisterra looks amazing.
Gelhardt is too damn slow to be a striker or winger ....this was against barnsley and they had him covered easily - he simply couldnt run down the pass as his pace was expired...he should go to right or left back positions...yes he does have talent but not the necessary intangible to be effective game after game!  its a cold world!
Even  with the B team they played  really  good 👍Leed new fan
At least Barnsley scored unlike that team in London😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Happy to see Cooper back and Klich getting a full 90, Leeds legends the both of them MOT!
Summerville looked confident and dynamic!
All goals came bc of SINISTERRA
Leeds just keep on winning
Well done lads a win is always pleasing.. Klich had a good game very professional.... Mot.
Hell yah. I love this team!! So exciting to watch.
I knew Sinisterra is going to be a beast,he should play on the right over DJ and Harrison on the left or even vice versa. That will be class ⚽️🤙🏾
I love the 3rd goal. In the space of 15 seconds:  - Klich messes up the pass. - Gelhardt wins possession back with tackle of the season contender. - Klich gets the ball back and buries it like a boss.
Luis Sinisterra LOOKS DANGEROUS!
DONT SLEEP ON SINISTERRA!!!!!
Alaw💙💛, wouldn’t have minded seeing the fight on the highlights though 🤣
Marsch has done the right thing bringing Sinisterra back slowly from injury but man it’ll be good when he’s fully up to speed and playing regularly in the league!
Three goal contributions from Sinisterra - looks like he should start ahead of James on current form. But between him and Harrison, both prefering the left side, how will they set up?
Vamos leeds. Saludos desde las grutas
Sinisterra is finally proving what he can do, what a game from him
Summerville was by far the best player tonight
MARSCHING ON TOGETHER!!!!!
Good for the backups
Klich’s goals are so casual. Love it.
What song is that being  played at full time it’s been bugging me for weeks😂
Sinisterra important in every goal, he gas to get into the main 11 ASAP
Sini's running. Really good. Can't wait to see how it plays in the Prem.
Klichu kocham cie
Barnsley played with more passion than Chelsea which is saying something. Those lads came to win against us and we did well to get the win. Hopefully they make their way out of League 1 and on to better things.
Wonderfull Goal From M. Klich 2x & L. Sinisterra. Leeds United Winners Against Barnsley FC In The Elland Road Stadium.
If I'm being ultra critical then I would say the defence needs to stay alert. That said, a good result and with time Sinisterra is going to panic defenders in the premier League
Sinisterra the beast from Feyenoord!!
I like what Jesse is doing. He giving the other guys opportunities at these games to get everyone experience. I'm proud to be an American!!!
Klich's passes are world class. Pure skill.
Another great win for the boys Amazing finish from Sinisterra and Klich's 2 Great passion from the commentators  Come on Leeds let's do the same against Wolves again💛💙
Bit late
If they had Cameras, why didn’t LUTV stream it?
Good performance from the squad players tonight. Monster goal scored by Sinisteria. People saying Joffy had a bad game, but that third goal starts with him pressing hard to recover the ball to give to Sinistera who makes the assist
I was there today right game for leeds💙🤍
Luis Sinisterra the best 🔥💫💫🔝🔝🔝🔝🔝
Release sinni v brighton
Sinisterror🔥
Mot 💙💛💙💛
Man how does Barnsley score more points than Chelsea
Sinisterra!!! 🇨🇴
Not our best performance but a solid result. Sinisterra, klich and Summerville all looked class.
ALAW SINNY IS A BEAST!!!!
Mot 🔵🟡🔵
