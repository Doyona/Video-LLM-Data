Watching this 2 years later. It’s crazy how not many people talk about Barbie anymore, it’s fizzled out quickly. Whereas Oppenheimer hasn’t
Me with my American accent that can’t do other accents   👁️ 👄 👁️
Cillian Murphy's American accent in the interview is adorable
Came here for Cilian but ended up falling in love with Margot ❤❤❤
All the memes showing Cilian Murphy annoyed at interviews... and here he is so genuinely interested and 100% in the conversation. Thank you Margot for bringing that up in him. I love how she is so natural, it really feels like they didn't prepare any questions and jump into it :) so refreshing
اشتلوجه أهل امحبنه
I hate when really talkative people keep interrupting a quiet person
So basically Margot had a blast going to movies and having dance parties and positive vibes on her movie and Cillian was starving cold and in a desert
I love that they’re interviewing each other ❤❤❤❤
such a lovely pairing!! First time watching a full Margot Robbie interview/ conversation and I love her!! so relatable! so me!
Cillian is so private and she repeatedly talks over him 😢
Very good podcast
i dont know if i see tommy shelby or cillan murphy
Okay now I will be brave and watch Oppenheimer…hate the thought of man having such deep dark minds…
متاسفانه انگلیسی بلد نیستم. وگرنه استفاده خوبی میکردم از این برنامه❤
❤
she said LIKE at least 500 times
Can’t believe Margo didn’t ask about Peaky Blinder
They pair well. He comes across intelligent she is keeping up.Hey  hollywierd this pair might be an interesting mix. Get some good writers and give them a decent written script. Nothing cliche. Some think meaty with not necessarily the two being a couple.
Two very attractive actors interviewing each other? I'm in heaven
Such a lovely interview. Cillian is so calming & laid back and a great listener. So glad he decided to do this 🤍
Oppenheimer was based on a book, no? Can we call it an original?
that was delightful to watch!
I speak for everyone when I say….  Never heard of greta gerbils or whatever her name is😂
wow nice
31:15
If Christopher Nolan doesn’t have a phone, how does he contact people?
Jest śliczna.
Он так вовремя ей подхихикивает во время её рассказа
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
40 min of margot talking 8 min of cillian
Unreal from Clapham to Hollywood well done Margot
I love how margot seemed like a genuine fan of cillian, especially the peaky blinder bit was so sweet
Did Margot really call the writing of Barbie a "Brilliant piece of writing" in front of OPPENHEIMER 💀 I mean she's really good and she's not comparing ik but, like yk what I'm saying
I love You guys
31:53 is she happy??  🍀🍀🍀
I wouldn't be able to speak if i was seating that close to Margot.
I would love to see them in a movie playing an 70 to 80 yeahr old couple just living live in there sence off perception just life with a sence off mind at the moment margos humor and kelians sharp sence of few i would love it
44:16 I HAD THE SAME EXCITEMENT SHE HAS ON HER FACE.
Is it not a bit weird ?
I wish Cillian could finish a thought. Margot keeps interrupting. She’s making me bananas. Ha! She’s like that person who always finishes other people’s sentences. It’s annoying!
Barbie made more money, while Oppenheimer became immortalized. There is balance in the world
26:30 the growing up with a lot of American shoes is so real
I refuse to believe this is the same guy who’s Tommy in Peaky blinders like the accent is so diff 😭
9:28  I LOVE when actors have kids that show them edits or js genuine media info abt them
What the f.. K was barbie I mean it was just nonesense and shit
super interesting conversation they aren't trying to entertain or tell funny stories. don't know how i got here i, never watch celebrity's interviews. so i thought wow cool channel let me check the other interviews. Allas the 2 i watched were celebrities trying to entertain any others kinda like this, this is interesting.
He would habe beend a mutch better ken he looks like a doll
Cillian and Margot are amazing at American accents. I remember being gobsmacked that Cillian wasn’t American.
Sorry Cillian does not compare to Margo. The Barbie movie IS NOT Shakespeare, its crap & this discussion is BS. Ham acting,childish & to watch this & margo talking as if it is a spectacular Oscar winning film is hilarious
I genuinely didn’t think either movie would be my taste simply due to genre. But I LOVED both!
i want a spin off and Margot IIIINNNN please omg
E aí vocês param ou tenho que destruir mais os estados unidos pra você pararem?
Love them fr
Nice podcast🎉
I wanna go back in time and watch Oppenheimer  for the first time again and just be “present” during ending
see folks, that's the power of memes
She is a really beautifull young Woman. He's also a good actor. I could tell that from the film 28 Days Late and so on. A so - called natural talent
The one time interview that got me nodding my head and smiling throughout
Yoooooooooo
No way 😂😂😂
Why I imagined you together ? 🫣🩵
This man said uffort.. I just knew
The BEST Actors on Actors yet. I totally agree with @danielv378 👏👏👏
Olympic-level cheek bones and two smart , articulate, talented legends. Loved this.
June Diane Raphael & Margot Robbie?
Take me back to the summer of 2023 😢
Margot Robbie is that kind of student in your school who's a popular achiever student but approachable, and oh I was surprised she's kind of geeky, didnt expect that as a first impression
Human, 🦍, chimpanzee  Human,god, devil
Calmest interview ever❤
They should both appear together in a movie
I never realised toy companies don't make movies!❤
👀 I like both actors, but I was honestly annoyed at how Margot kept interrupting Cillian while he spoke....she's a fantastic person, but not the best conversationalist...Cillian could barely get a sentence out without her constant interjections....
How does one get excited about playing Barbie
Nice to hear an intelligent conversation between two very “normal” Hollywood people
Im glad they didnt miss the barbenheimer opportunity for this matchup
Cillian from what I’ve read doesn’t like being famous or in the spotlight so him not like most interviews makes sense, he clearly enjoys being around Margot, I mean who wouldn’t?
She interrupted him 800 times. We can never get enough Cillian Murphy.
I enjoyed this conversation.  Both of them are relaxed and it's such a positive interaction
킬리언이 마고로비 쳐다보는 눈빛이 너무 설렘 말을 존나 진심으로 듣고 공감하는 것 같아서 개좋음
20:42 Love that!
Watched them both in theaters
Margot literally has the perfect face
HE'S A KEN!!! HE'S SUCH A KEN😍😍 THEY'RE BARBIE AND KEN 💗💗
"How's an algoritm is tracking me?". One word: k-means. We're _VERY_ predictable as human beings, Even setting as simple as k-means is really good at making recommendations.
Wow two elitists in films that destroyed society.
I love the way these two interact 💕.  I really love that Cillian is so open, I am a big fan of Cillian Murphy forever! He is so comfortable in this interview!  I am so impressed by both actors and their process.
Imagine how talented you must be to have one of the greatest directors of our time to hire you over and over and over again for any movie they make, and then this one time they are like "i am making this role for u and the movie will be centered around u." Cillian Murphy deserves all the praise, the man is a great actor.
Margot fan girling about Peaky Blinders is awesome
Cillian
Barbie is a below average movie, another BS pushed down the audience throat, overhyped, until it gets popular
Thần thánh sugar
shut ma
43:12 Margot asking about Peaky Blinders
39:00
Openheimer, Heimdal, The Rainbow Flag over Ireland? Guys (and Gals) wake up, wake up before good and evil gets too much to bare! 1000 year prison sentences in the good old US of A. Common peoples.... The signs are all there.
Lol cillian is just chilln there, well hes the goat alongside keanu for me
Incredible interview but the microphones used are really weird, I feel like I’m on a discord call lol. Maybe that’s just me.
This is such a great conversation
16:46 19:34 20:43
I love Margo but pls let Cillian finish an answer
The way that Margot describes the writing process for Barbie, I wonder if those writers played DnD. <3
Dunno why but love this shot 47:55
Why wouldn’t Mattel agree? Capitalism and as violent as Mattel’s doesn’t care about what values are depicted along with the brand as long as it skyrockets sales, which I’m sure this film did, absurd coming from an “independent filmmaker”
The way she’s says Tommy fucking Shelby is class 😂😂
This is such an awesome interview. I felt like a fly on the wall of a dinner conversation. I love them both
Por que eu demorei tanto para assistir  isso?? juntar dois dos maiores atores da atualidade isso sim é ouro, admiro my os dois ❤
❤❤
Question: Who knows the name of the jazz song that plays at the beginning of the clip?
I think it's neat that he said, "That happens a lot, isn't it?" It's a very Indian thing.
in my opinion the best movie in history is peaky blinders.❤ greetings from Indonesia 🎉
If you’re here in this video for Peaky Fooking Blinder part ONLY .. it starts from 43:15  Your Welcome maiiites …
Im here for Cillian, come on lets get there
Chemistry is top notch, it is clear in body language especially of culian as he moves along the interview. They should do a movie together!
We need angelina jolie & cillian !!!
It's the third time I'm watching this. It's perfect <3
Genuine souls...🇿🇦
I hope they reunite for a film! Thank you for making this interview happen, it was both a clever and kind exchange 🥰
Cillian's movie was amazing.   Barbie movie...wth was that?! Completely stupid movie.

Cillian Murphy is really big actor
8:21 exactly!!!
7:55 that’s so true!
8:27 you know guys, there is a producer/director in India, who tells audience what shoudl they watch and what not. If his movie doesn't work, he blames the audience that audience is stupid and his movies are fine. Also other director he tells his audience to boycott his movie.  That's funny 😂
They look like extremely hot siblings.
Apart from these 2 being very easy viewing, I love the way that they articulated things that I couldnt on how I have experienced their work and films and enjoyed it. Its a penny drop moment why I'd take the time to stop and watch these 2 in any film even if not obviously appealing to my taste. The obvious to the sumbliminal detail behind how to create an immersive experience in a cinema and a bond with film and characters. 2 super smart individuals that in this mutual actor interview is just comfortable and not voyeuristic and definitely miles from the often cringe promotional stuff when you know people just dont want to be there. I always thought it was weird how audiences or fans could think that they actually know actors personally from their work but in this case, and its remarkable really, that this is pretty much how the dynamic between these 2 is here - that they know each other in many ways yet its the first time they have met. Hopefully they in future they will work together as the chemistry is already apparent.
Margot is so beautiful. Absolutely stunning. Shes such an amazing actress, too ❤🌹
Cillian is amazing & so chill, love that dude, but... Margot is so knowledgeable, intuitive, inquisitive, engaging, mesmerizing, this is not what I expected. I watch the occasional video like this, it is interesting to hear actors speak about their roles, but I am astounded by her presence in this.
dig the Drowsy Doll outfit
Zzzz Bring out the pole
We Need A Barbenheimer Movie To Show On Cinema's. Actually It Will Be Legendary.
man i just cant forget the wolf of wall street scenes with margot ....
Two really talented down to earth artists
Yes please don’t do a sequel. It’s perfect as stand alone
It’s cult actor asmr
she said Greta won’t let us down
I think he is more beautiful than her. 100% its a rare beauty
What i doh'l like about the talk is all this vanila-smile-barely-scratch kind of it. That pink girl is a great producer - why don't bring up the behind scene, problems on the set, getting money. Real life affecting the acting. Worsts and bests in the career etc. There could be a big deep talk there.  Don't get me wrong - this format is great too, i like it. But we all wanted more of those too in this interaction.
My friends and I did a whole Barbenheimer day when the movies came out and it's one of my favorite memories ever 💓
43:18 fuckn facts hahahahahahha
+1 liked video hehe. My favorite actor and actress!
They're both so beautiful and you can see there's mutual respect between them
OK first, why pair Cillian with MR. She's not in his league. Mr may have acted in a handful of movies, but she appears as MR. the most overrated actor but boring all across.  Cillian should be paired wit the likes of Jessica Chastain or Anne Hathaway
off topic, but why do they look like a father-daughter duo?? 😂😅
I enjoyed both Margot & Cillian equally. maybe the first time I have listened to-two actors conversation brilliant and interesting!
This is the first one of these Actors on Actors videos that I've seen that wasn't difficult to watch because the actors weren't comfortable. These two were relaxed and trusted each other and just had a nice conversation. Neither was clearly uncomfortable when it was their time to answer questions or in awkwardly trying to navigate the other's ego. Which is funny because Cillian Murphy is always uncomfortable answering questions 😆 It was great to see him so relaxed here.
43:14
It’s nice to watch this now and reminisce on the absolute vibe that was Barbenheimer. Off topic, but Margot Robbie’s comment did remind me that k-pop stars have been using face masks for years now. Sure, it was generally popular there even before covid but the rest of the world really missed out on the opportunity to make face masks a normal, socially acceptable thing during regular times. Anyway, I just feel bad for all the celebrities that can’t enjoy any privacy because of paps and stuff.
Cilian Murphy is actually enjoying this conversation with Margot. Amazing
I'm such a massive fan of both of u and cilian, I just learned what memes are too😂😂!!! Very nonspecific I don't like em!!😂😂😂😂
VERY BEAUTIFULL
Fun fact: they have both played Batman villains.
Painful. For Cilian
She also has a production company. Of course Cillian enjoys talking with her!....
The Barbi actress is a f....in airhead.😅😅😅
Thommy
The person who paired them up deserves a raise
great people, great questions, great vibes. love the both of them
I cannot believe we did not discuss Thomas Shelby and the peaky f**king blinders
love these 2
How are they so beautiful??
She made him blush at 27:14 😂😂😂 he had a little stutter 😊
No tenía idea que Margot había hecho tanto por la película. Ni siquiera que había sido productora, estuve medio perdida de internet antes de que se estrenara y no me enteré de mucho. Pero es interesante todo lo que conversan acá.
Cillian untouched by Hollywood still.  Chris Nolan is a master.
She is nervous if him
Haha, I agree that American is a lazy accent. Take everything and make it flat.   Good show!  ( This is coming from an American.)  Something about me felt Ian McKellen talking about the CGI level of the production.
the quiet kid and the class clown energy
They have the same eyes!!
intro and outro song
Is she talking about the same Barbie movie we watched, that was one of the most stupid movie I ever watched!
32:27 THAT is something.
Barbie... took a lot of preps for such a bad movie and scripts.
28:37 bro i eat this shot up tell me more guys
20:52 the way they are so interested in the others prep process and trying to soak up and learn something new. They both are very professional and driven
Get them in a crime movie together!  Brother & sister crime partners, would be awesome!
44:26 SHE'S SO REAL FOR THIS
Margot doesn't let Cillian talk! He didn´t finish the story of their parent´s impression seeing the movie... :(
oh, found you.
Cillian Murphy looks like Eric Roberts? 🤔
Cillian is just so cool
9:09 meme 43:13 peaky blinders
LEZGOOO I'M GONNA REWATCH PEAKY BLINDERS NOW
Rosee
Asco
Margo is so pretty!!
Great Actros
Amazing interview 👏
Absolutely loved the conversation. Anna both movies are amazing
I love watching and listening to them discuss their creative process. The mutual respect and understanding they share is absolutely beautiful.
🎉😂
cillian murphy best interview ever
They're both so calm and calming, so beautiful, so in awe of eachother's talent and humanity, this was a delight to watch, so brilliant, so intelligent and interesting duo!
😅
Nah they will always be Tommy Shelby and Harley Quinn to me
Cillian Murphy notoriously hates interviews but you can tell he's genuinely enjoying this conversation with Margot Robbie - I think any conversation about the actual filmmaking process and acting is the key to get this man to open up; the problem is that famous actors have to deal with so many shallow and silly questions from other interviewers, for someone like him who seems to be a massive introvert it seems especially painful. But yea of course this seems more like a very organic conversation between two people who love the craft
This proved cinema is NOT DEAD
Such chemistry I blusheed
Combined, each of the 2 films covered diverse audiences (children/tweens/parents/ biographically scientific, etc) as a whole at a time (Post-COVID restrictions) when people wanted to get out, resume normality & be filled with fun/dress up (Barbie) and scientific knowledge (Oppenheimer) of one of the most powerful & apocalyptic discoveries in the world (Manhattan Project/ atomic bomb).  KUDOS to all involved in each production.
they can not see the scripts because takes some time (very little actually) to  AI create it.
❤❤❤ambos grandes atores.
loved both movies - Oppenheimer should've been an HBO limited series & don't make a sequel for Barbie - it was perfect
Cillian super falante nessa entrevista oq é absolutamente raro, e a margot interrompendo ele toda hora, chato deixa o homem falar
What a great pair
Sometimes, these conversations work because the pair of actors are friends that like to chat and the viewer is almost invited into this friendly chat.  In this case, it works because that's exactly not the case and they're both very interested to learn how the other does the same profession, and the viewer is just a fly on the wall.
Margot Robbie talks too much. I wish she had given Cillian more time to talk also. Cillian was being a gentlemen letting her talk without interrupting her. But this was a great show. Loved it.
What a trully brilliant interview, they compliment each other so well and they are both so interesting and interested.
Barbie is a useless movie, horrible plot. Margot’s ego is all over this video. So disappointed. Instead, Cillian is so humbled and he respects his job.
Australian accents double anybody’s hotness
Cillian is such a good listener
What’s not to love about Margo !? She has a childlike enthusiasm and she’s incredibly charming oh and btw she’s also a 10! It’s no wonder dude was enjoying himself during this conversation.
She talked ,he listened
need to know her lipstick color 🥺
Margot is sooooo energetic, Cillian is so peaceful i just loved this
I'm so glad she asked about Peaky Blinders!! I was like pleeeease... Still my favorite work of his.
Sono cosi belli cosi genuini,bellissima chiaccherata❤
i love these two :')
Thermal damage from smoking. Use grape seed extract and raw honey to treat throat
Margot Robbie looks and speaks so much like someone I know, it's so strange.
Margot please let him finish...
Can someone expand on the childhood work to prepare your role? I’m so curious about this !
i really love how them tell perpective about the movie on they characther. i really have same perpective like they say. really, they have good connecting to the watcher
_"Now I become Doll... the architect of joy."_  (M. C. Barbenheimer in a nutshell)
Where is that part?? Can we talk about "Thomas Fucking Shelby" 43:13
Cillian, ugh ❤
Now I want those two on screen together so bad. That would be epic.
I always forget Cillians age he looks 33 and then said I have two teenage boys 😂
Dark Knight is where he started shooting imax and I think he broke one of the only two of those cameras in existence at the time
Tommy Shelby would or wouldn't have watched the Barbie movie
She’s just beautiful but come on with Barbie.  It was horrible and hard to watch.  I only watch to look at her
her fan girling over Peaky Blinders lol 🤣 awesome
Their children wouldn’t be ugly
This was so fun!! Loved it.
They're both so smart and interested in each other.
What a lovely conversation between two amazing actors who've met for the first time. I was totally intrigued and could listen and watch them for hours speaking to each other.
This is probably one of the most Iconic pair I have seen so far. Brilliant 🙏❤
Every once in a while, I remember this interview happened and I would watch it again.
Cillian seems like such a genuine person, one of the very few celebs I'd love to meet
That was well-worth all 48 minutes and 27 seconds of my time.  Now trying figure out which one of the two is my one true love.  😍
Variety, you should do a Leo & Kate sit down
Brilliant ❤
loved the chat
It's awesome when the best actors reveal their thought process
They're so much more normal than the American actors.
ultimate black cat + golden retriever duo
once i decided to watch this interview in class, and i wasn’t sure who i liked more, cillian or margot, and then my teacher asked me why i was blushing at my schoolwork
really loved this!
Cilian is so serious looking he was a dynamite in the nuclear bomb movie❤❤
Miért nem lehet a lényeget röviden leirni. A sok meséhez már nincs türelme az embernek.
Still the most popular video on Variety 😊
Margot Robbie  Box Office: $4.8 billion  Cillian Murphy  Box Office: $5.9 billion   Cillian Murphy made more money than Margot Robbie.
43:12 to those wondering when did they talk about peaky blinders.  Your Welcome
43:20
Today's comment !!!!!! ????
It's funny how these two get paired up seeing as they are barbenheimer, but both the opposite leads (Emily Blunt and Ryan Gosling) do a movie together a year later.
I love how both actors here lowering down their egos, prides, and knowledges to be a student for each other, like they really want to learn. truly listening, truly asking questions and not just like in the base of formality.
aaahh it was a great time for cinema, now look at Gladiator 2 and Wicked both movies getting loved.
Sh talked too much, we barely heard him speak.
can you imagine Margot Robbie saying "i'm a fan of yours" good god
quite possibly the 2 hottest human beings to currently exist
one's yapping another one's observing, the greatest combo of all time
44:01 46:14
12:20
i adore this interview
Still my favorite Actors on Actors conversation of all time
Barbenhimer
I disagree with Margot Robbie on CGI 41:05  Most Korean movies have very good CGI effects, more so than other countries.  American cenematic CGI are utterly horrible.
One year mark 12/5/24
this is almost a year ago and I remember this like yesterday I’ll be back tomorrow
Meeting Hollywood legends has always been a dream, but Keanu Reeves is in a league of his own. His humility, grit, and wisdom inspire endlessly. Who wouldn’t want to chat with the man behind Neo and John Wick
During the accent part, margo literally just said irish has good rep as well and it cuts to commercials it's colin firth as the penguin :D proves her point really
Margot is so good at these, she is a great interviewer.
46:16  31:45 43:13 47:38    19:33  17:53
Unconscious learning is obvious here
Don't loose yourself while working..  don't go with the character..
I dont know why I find Margot Robbie so uninteresting. Like, I respect her, have nothing against her but it's just so... Padrão.
i dont like Robbie at all
Barbie not even in the same universe as Oppenheimer. Cillian is amazing
Cillian Murphy (Jonathan Crane/Scarecrow) and Margot Robbie (Harley Quinzel/Harley Quinn) finally reunited
Well 50% of that was interesting 😂
Loved this!!❤
Absolutely love this one. Great pairing with these two. Not trying to take anything away from how talented and smart Margot is…. But hot damn…. What a lady 😍😍.
I must confess that I didn't watch Peaky Blinders when it came out. Yet, Wow! Now, after binge-watching four seasons, I am in the first category of being obsessed with Peaky Blinders! Don't you think there is stage direction that repeats throughout the script as "Tommy Shelby gets beaten to a bloody pulp once again?" The set, writing, cinematography, costume design, acting, and music. Then there are just those CU's of Cillian Murphy's eyes and face that are like some magic peek into Tommy Shelby's soul!
The arse licking on display here is mind blowing
Didn’t watch either. One was a stone cold killer and the other was a feminist repackaging but the actors are good at their job.
she barely left talk to Cillian, or just me whose perception?
2024/10/29 شاهدت هذا اللقاء.. اتمنى ان تطرح سلسلة جديدة من مسلسل (بيكي بلايندرز) لانه اجمل وافضل مسلسل لدي. شكراً كيليان على هذا العمل وستبقى ممثلي الاجنبي المفضل، احبك.
The chemistry and synergie between them is fantastic! Great pairing, great interview.
I was hoping he would play dr doom..
The best interview.  I'd love to see these two filming together.
Uff yo disfruté tanto ese momento del cine. Amé ir de rosado y ver Barbie y de una vez comprar tiquete para ver Oppenheimer. El hecho de saber que muchos lo estábamos haciendo fue emocionante.
butt face
butt face
I would love a thriller with romantic undertones starring this brilliant pairing
That’s Tommy fookin Shelby!!!!!
He Cillian by the Million. Just finished Peaky Blinders and watch again.... because of Cillian
so this is an interview about barbie
issuetainment.
hector and a recrudescence is not a word, which, by virtue of not being a word, is great, larger
What ever role Margot plays she steals the show. But for me this was her worst film. Can't believe we had to wait untill 43:00 to bring up Peaky Blinders?? And no mention of Wolf of Wall Street??
This man just gets better and better. He's so attractive, you can't resist him.
A good interview not  boring  Thank  you
believe for a second
bracing for impact
He Is good actor people in India love him.
strict macho
You came for this moment 43:18
Cillian murphy is having so much bad attitude always
Both are terrific actors! Bravo!
dang 6 years to set up thats long. I wonder how many movies proposals there are right now in that similar phase..
Harris Mark Hall Donna Martinez Karen
43:14
Wasn't the suicide squad 2021 shot on imax? bc margot said she hasn't done a movie using imax
I kinda wanna see Mr. Murphy do a comedy lol.
Awesome 👌 👏 👍
For people who are here for the Peaky Blinders part, it's 43:13
Nice talk ✨
I think Margot Robbie is in love with cillian Murphy, even if she is married or taken
They have very similar facial bone structure! I’m pretty sure she’d look like him if she cut her hair like his
Her need to learn is incredibly intense. She's a sponge on an intellectual level. I didn't expect that.
4:11
two very smart and intelligent people having a conversation. really awesome
margot robbie is Extremely impressive
I am not at all surprised that this is Variety’s most popular video.
All of that is bullshit. The cash-cow was: Barbie is a thing that all girls like, right? And. If Barbie was a 'real girl' all their fathers and everyone else that has a hard on for the girl that used to be in Neighbours would swim to swim in her. Her promoters told her to do this. It is all a farse.
:(
I love margot,she literally the BEST!!!! 💓💓🤩🤩
I googled the 2 humans with the most amazing eyes...and got this.
You are both amazing actors and actress's! Thank you Margot Robbie and Cilliam Murphy!
Barbehenimer crossover of the century
I know Daniel Day Lewis did the perfect Lincoln I mean he WAS Lincoln but something about Cilian’s face and eyes and expression in the first season of Peaky Blinders to me reminds me SO much of a young Abraham Lincoln that I wish he could somehow have found a role or screenplay to play him. But time has marched on. Oh well.
1113 Graham Island
SHE TALKED SOOOO MUCH.
Cillian murphy❤❤❤
Just amazing!!!
Killian myrphy loving roman shecspire
I love margot
I don't know why people are acting like they where in same movie?
Wish Margot would let him finish a sentence without interrupting
its fucking crazy that barbenheimer happened more than an year ago and margot is such a fangirl of thomas shelby it was so cute to watch her plead at the end, thats literally all of us peaky blinders fandom to cillian. Good to see some1 tell him to do a spinoff movie!!
Barbenheimer was the best double feature ever. Hands down
Scarecrow and Harley Quinn
43:20
Two people with a perfect jawline
43:13
I don't think Cillian give's a fuck😊 to anyone who talk's about acting
Untuk orang indo 43:18 scene yg anda cari
I'd love to see Margot and Cillian in a film together, feel like it would be so cool to see them together.
They are so fake it’s almost unreal. Brainwashed community in the comments
Margot doing the lord's work asking for more peaky blinders 😂
43:13 very unexcpected
They are both slaves who can’t speak what they think freely
Too little Oppenheimer, too much Barbie in this interview 🤔🙄 nonetheless quite curious talk 😅 very respectful and supportive from both sides 💖
We need a movie with these two ASAP
Barbie won the battle Oppenheimer won the war
🎉+🎉
They having a mug off in the thumbnail
this is what blake lively and ryan reynolds are trying to be with deadpool vs wolverine and it ends with us
They are both awesome.
They need to do an actual Barbenheimer movie where Barbie teams up with Oppenheimer in the real world to stop nuclear war.
Cillian was very gracioius. He 's such an interesting, highly intelligent and humble man. I found Margot irritating and vacuous.
"Please, do it. Pleeeaaasseee?!"

Ohhhh Margot Robbie a Fan of Cillian Morphie

Qué molesta mujer!! No deja hablar a Cilian!
Anne Hathaway y Margot Robbie Please
43:16 What we want
Cillian is one of the best actors ever! He’s into no fame and all that celebrity s*it. So humble, kind, authentic and intelligent. He’s true rarity in Hollywood!💙
19:18 no boiler suit
Team Cillian.
Cillian Murphy and margot robbie on each other seems spicy wouldn't you say ? (⁠ ͡⁠°⁠ ͜⁠ʖ⁠ ͡⁠°⁠)
"Barbie" is a movie whose legacy will last a lunchtime.
43:18 thanks me later
I remember Cillian
Goat cillian Murphy 🗿
They should hook up
Barbenheimer
Good lucking couple. Love (making love) films from these 2😂❤ (I know they are both married, but they are actors too....🤤)
I came to see the peaky blinder part
Non ci sono Parole ☆☆☆❤❤❤
Hellywood 🔥 run by bunch of fallen angels /demons , but not for long! Lord Jesus Christ is coming soon 🙏🏼❤️🕊Repent, believe in the Gospel, Be Born Again
Cillian is probably thinking, ‘they couldn’t find an actual actress for me to talk to ‘??
Margot Robbie can’t act.
All that I can say is that Margot is a real life size barbie. She was born to play that role!
HOW CUTE
Love how margot just straight jumping into fangirling over peaky fuckin blinders just like the rest of us
This guys made me bi
This was AMAZING
43:13 ❤
She slayed the "Tommy fooockin' Shelby" line 😊❤
Nice ❤❤
I’d rather cast Margot Robbie as Bond Girl/ James Bond’s (Henry Cavill) love interest, and probably last Lashana Lynch reprise her role as Nomi from No Time To Die.  Henry Cavill as the new James Bond  Margot Robbie as Freya Smith, Bond Girl  Lashana Lynch as Nomi  Cillian Murphy as Dr Aimé Zorin, the lead villain   David Dastmalchian as Corbin,  the Villain and Dr Zorin’s henchman   Emily Blunt as Ava MoneyPenny   Phoebe Waller-Bridge as Q   with Idris Elba as M  with Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Felix Luther Bond, James’ Brother/ Sidekick   and Rachel Zegler as Autumn Bell, Felix’s love interest     Ed Sheeran & Taylor Swift both should write an original theme music with Jack Antonoff, and probably have Rachel Zegler sing it if she’s interested.  Or maybe ask Sia if she’s interested in writing a theme song for the film & have Zegler sing it.  Hans Zimmer and Jack Antonoff compose the soundtrack   Produced By: Christopher McQuarrie p.g.a., Christopher Nolan p.g.a.                          Emma Thomas p.g.a.,  Written By: Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Christopher McQuarrie & Christopher Nolan  Directed By: Christopher Nolan  I also wish that film was 3hrs long like Oppenheimer, and finally get a $2B Box Office film.   Production Company: New Line Cinema, Syncopy, Inc.  Metro-Goldwyn-Meyer, Eon Productions, Legendary Pictures    Distributed By: Universal Pictures & Warner Bros. Pictures
And just like that, from over almost a decade of actors on actors videos, cillian and margot achieved the greatest views in just 7 months, legendary.

Best interview I have watched this year, it's beautiful!
They are both so cute and intelligent 🖤💕 can’t stop watching ☀️
"Nobody likes being told what to do" the Peaky Blinder is resurfacing in him
Barbenheimer
43:12, peaky blinder topic
Arthur - Tommy hurry up or else Polly will have his balls.
There's a perfect balance between education and entertainment.
TWO AWESOME ACTORS IN TWO GARBAGE MOOVIES....
She talks too much in my guess. As a non english speaker, looks like too many talks.
Be good to see them both in a film together. It looks like they’d work well together. Margot was so desperate to chat about Peakys 😂
Love Cillian Murphy in any movie. Always interesting characters.
Both of them are such calm people. Cillian really knows how to talk. Also, it is soooo interesting to hear about the work process, the thoughts, the atmosphere on set, how they prepare for roles etc. I love all of these insights.
I LOVED THISSSS
very  good
Should’ve just called this Cillian Payed to Shrink for Margot 😂
DO not skip this; Barbie ended up with an interview regarding a Psychologist who was literally the Barbie (Margot Robbie) ... Please remind me now what was Harley Quinn's job before she met the Joker???
If I did something wrong sorry I just sketch book clip photos was deleted I hope you dream come ture, top art performances 😊
They're so amazing ❤
You are good actor amazing soos❤
Superstar soon
This was such a perfect collab
Nice conversation ❤❤
Margot the sponge. Asking questions and observing from every conversation she has. The most interesting is yet to come.
Kate mckinnon
actors are super sensitive. treat them with care.
I never knew that fact about Christopher Nolan the the 21st of July. For those that don't wanna do a lot of searching, I've compiled some of the dates below, some do not follow but most do:  Oppenheimer (2023): Jul 21 Tenet (2020): Sep 3 - delayed most likely due to covid Dunkirk (2017): Jul 21 Interstellar (2014): October 26 - no clue why this varies Dark Knight Rises (2012): Jul 20 Inception (2010): Jul 13 Dark Knight (2008): Jul 20 Batman Begins (2005): Jun 15

Man, this would've been so much betetr if barbie was actually good. I wanted to like it so bad
😂😂😂 perfect 👌🏾
Cillian dressed in all black and margot in pink perfectly match their recent roles
44:11 now that I'm here from the future where it's official that Cillian will be returning as Tommy for a Peaky Blinders movie, it is so entertaining to see his thought process behind returning to the role, as well as Margot's desire for him to do it. I'm sure she's ecstatic about the news
I DONT LIKE BOTH OF U :) I USED TO LIKE TOMMY ALOT
cheekbones for days
Cillian Murphy recognizing that children write stories chronologically is so deep to me for some reason. Kind of unlocked memories of when we had to make up and write stories in elementary school. Writing chronologically seems like such an adventurous way to imagine. And when we were children our minds went everywhere before the limitations of reality stripped away that magic.
Cillian 🥹❤️
2 sigmas on their way 🗿
Brill interview 👍 👏 👌
barbie is like strapping into a electric chair , painful to watch , lol
Barbenheimer Is Reality Biggest Crossover Ever
Oppenheimer and Barbie sitting together?  Wow.
Killian
Your mom doesn’t exist
No I’m not watching Barbie and giving it my energy I’m just letting it rot on the vine
It was fun to play me in the movies? Think again
Yea I’m obviously starlight
Appreciates the creation but doesn’t appreciate the creator from which the creative energy flows from SO WEIRD I hate it here
I mean a red carpet for Barbie without inviting Barbie the energy? Weird earth
I can hold you in my hand in my giant body and I can hold the whole world as a grain of sand in my real size body I have a few sizes
Sims on sims
I should have said she could trust her spiritual brothers that was my mistake
Elissa has men falling all over her and she came in when that was happening and I was just trying to calm her down about it BULL SHIT
My brothers are insanely sweet I could cry right now thinking about that time
Well I probably did it for the attention of my sister but yeah I guess that was mean
And let me guess she did it for bits and clicks
I mean she made them look really bad and it caused all this anger in me towards them and affected all of our dreams in a negative way
And that’s why I hate her
I was only happy with gigi cuz she made my brothers look so bad
I’m focused on my past lives with her as my best friend I gotta get over it
Margot said I think I’m focused on the past
You guys gotta focus on the present moment to move into the future ad stop daydreaming about it
You woke up this morning with my energy inside of you
So you understand the term present moment?
The boys have
Forget about the future you’re being sued from space because in the present moment my energy is animating you get over it
In the present moment my energy animates you
Are you aware that is my energy that animates you?
We’re not all connected it’s just me and I delete people who take credit and say stupid shit like that
If yo buy a triforce ring your wedding is doomed cuz your listening over walls an stealing from the princess during the transition
In this ep of Elissa Margot takes credit for Elissa’s life story and think she ls the least bit creative
In this episode of Elissa a robot tells Elissa story over and over and over and eats sushi and take fancy vacation with MY MONEY
That was a good year for film and its been a great year so far for 2024
It is just about the work. Many women will and have been canceled by this.
Love the Ending Well it was nice talking to you Margot.. "Hopefully not for the last time" These two could be great friends

How about a GI Joe meets Barbie sequel !?! ❤
❤
I’ll always have an intense level nostalgia when thinking of the summer of ‘23, and these two are both, in part, responsible.
Greta totally beaten up by Chris😂
ppl see them as barbie and oppenheimer  what dc fans see: SCARECROW AND HARLEY QUINN
Two of the few hero actors keeping us going into the cinema unlike most other woke actors who are all politics and no talent, no passion. These two in contrast leave their souls into the characters they play so us the audience can connect and relate to them deeply.
I enjoy this conversation this is the second time I play it. Months later, almost like a podcast. Brings back memories of a great summer.
Margot said to me. I love your comments on my page.... Six years engaged in holy matrimony Margot makes me marvellously myristic moo me to get attached
BARBENHEIMER
Wow. Both are so humble and soft spoken. I don’t like celebrities interviews because they try too hard to sound interesting or witty, but these two are so natural and comfortable with each other.
❤
Margot spoke so much . . .
Barbie was trash as movie how does anyone compare to oppenheimer????
Sorry.... Really Cillian? You debase your outstanding work with this tripe interview??? Barbie ? All your hard work for this shite?  Good Lord!🤦🏽‍♀️
43:48
This is phenomenal content.
Love her she is brilliant Cillian 👏 👌🏽
Scarecrow and Harley Quinn 🔥
Hearing Margot talk about Greta makes me even more sad that she wasn't nominated for best director.
this is incredible
actor on factor.. 👏👍
Well, Scarecrow and Harley Quinn together in a video, nice
I, Nic W [peter kook] humbly request your helping hand in a role in a mobster godfather type familyvideo/blockbuster film. only claim is I get to wear redwing manufactured irish setter non steel toe tailored military style boots
Putting those two movies out on th same day was a genius marketing scheme
11:16 - *sharp inhale and holding back the chuckle at his own remark*
43:14 Peaky blinders part🤝🏼
He reminds me of a snale.. a snale with a sunburn..
This guy is so disgusting.. I would wash myself for a month....
Cillian Murphy is Absolutely. Phenomenal!   i’ve been following him for years!  He is tremendously talented!
Could she not finish his sentences?? Let's see if she let's him talk much about himself...Wow she is interupting him?? Really???
The conversation on prep time can be applied to many careers. I've thoroughly enjoyed this interview! Definitely gained my insight into the development process.
After this interesting chat, I expect these two to work together sooner or later
43:13 peaky blinders🔥🔛🔝
I know Cillian isn't the biggest fan of interviews and this is different to press and actors. I felt Margot could have asked more and occasionally interrupted
The best two
Hi from Vasco You know why something funny way Yes a movie director asked for hair style non classic one to work as actress ❤
OOh Margo... I always day dream that i am married to Margo and we have two kids and i work in construction and we always make love at night . Is there something wrong with me  Am I alright ? Do I need help ????
They either look like siblings or a couple
Fargot Mobbie really deserves a raise
Ok. The Actors on Actors i want now is Tiffany Haddish and Leslie Jones. But actually Variety is probably MUCH too white a platform to produce that interview
Barbieheimer is real.🤣🖤😌
This man 🥹😮‍💨😭
If they had a baby together can you imagine what the kid's face would look like??
Children didn't start meme's lol. They are a part of literature.
언제 봐도 정말 좋아요 지난 여름에 바비와 오펜하이머 영화를 보고 느꼈던 감정이 다시 올라왔어요! 같은 직종의 사람들끼리 나누는 대화는 확실히 깊이감이 다르네요 잘 아는 분야에 대한 심오한 대화가 로망인 사람이 말합니다! 킬리언 머피와 마고 로비 둘 다 존경합니다!
I miss Barbenheimer
For the small minority of commenters here who feel compelled to point out how incomparable Oppenheimer and Barbie are, or the ones who want to pretend Mr. Murphy wasn't charmed by Ms. Robbie, and wasn't speaking to her as an equal about the job of film acting, I think your misogyny is showing. You may have trouble believing that a woman as gorgeous and sweet as Ms. Robbie is a serious person. Mr Murphy doesn't appear to share your disbelief. CM is one brilliant actor but clearly not an outgoing dude. This is the most relaxed I've ever seen him in an interview. I think MR's bubbly enthusiasm helped him be more comfortable, and I don't think he minded at all that she spoke more than he did. He requested the interview. Maybe he had an instinct that they would bring out the best in each other. They did.
Barbenheimer 😂
I thought Oppenheimer was too long. For the Barbie movie I thought Ken and Barbie actors were too old to play those parts. I also did not care for the ending.
Best duo so far. There is lots of good insight and no inside jokes or clowning around.
Quiz!! How many cillian said yeah?
❤❤🎉🎉
I'm surprised he actually does stuff like this. Promo does he need it?
Robie should remake make 'Tankgirl'
luv these two :)
Omg! So much work was done. I have never thought that it would take so much effort to film
Cilian Id really suggest if u get Oppenheimer haircut and remove that ring u would be even more hot
I love Margot but the longer the interview goes on you can tell she falls behind on Cillian's intellect.
Bless Margot, but does she actually listen to what's being said.
Thomas Shelby takes a pressure on Barbie
It's not relative to these movies, but they both played Batman villains who were psychologists at Arkham
Very nice. Big fan of both. However, odd that a artist who thoroughly understands the mechanics of vocal production in the mouth speaks on fry tones.
Just give me new season of peaky blinders
i wish they will do a movie together
Who else are here for just to listen about peaky blinders?
You can't pair Cillian Murphy with an equal. No one can hide how they look up to him anymore :)
Welcome back to Chillin with Cillian: today we have Barbie on set
First 6 mins with Margo were boring. Almost fall asleep.
Damn cilian is so chill in this.
Wow so sweet... Margot is goregous also
Shes so hot , but her ass isnt like super flattering … 🤔
This is so interesting. I think it was around I, Tonya that I realized Margot had something special but to see all the different ways she approaches her work, that she produces and stars in her movies, wow. She’s 100% that bitch. You go gurl.
I saw both movies in the cinema twice!
Felicidades!!
Why anybody is talking about the bright producer mind and intelligence of Margot. She is wild.
He is brilliant and handsome 😍
Barbieheimer
Harley Quinn and Scarecrow.
HOLLYWOOD WE NEED THESE TWO IN A MOVIE TOGETHER
I love them both. Such a great conversation. And I love that she threw in last minute her love for Peaky Blinders. I would have done the same :)
Cillian is such an eloquent speaker. The way he is able to express his thoughts in a simple and clear but profound manner amazes me every time I see his interviews.
❤
Margot’s face looks like cgi. A true freak of nature w/ the highest cheek bones in human history. Even Cillian is fascinated
Life is so simple😂
The obsession people have with these actors is quite pathetic.
I am fostered living sorry sharing property with Spanish Lady well her name is Mariana
10 years ago
Mr William must be now in his 70s
US too i was told just had 1 wife i think he was deeply in love him
Men told me off Spañolo Uk too guys see what i mean Asia anyway
I did not tell mom Spanish Hi Cillian,  8 years ago happy i am muslim non any more Christian, I am 52 years old i am a big great fan of Yours ❤
Bro is "NOT" interested in this😂
I actually miss Barbenheimer! That was such a great day!  I saw Barbie first and then Oppenheimer, and I loved every second!
I don't often like the "Actors on Actors" episodes (that I've seen--not a whole lot of them) but I completely enjoyed this one. Both Margot and Cillian take their craft so entirely seriously and treat it with such integrity. And they showed up in this episode with that same realness and integrity and respect for each other as well. So well done to both of you and to all who brought this episode together.
6:00 🤤
Margot is like Barbie.   Margot is too much Margot.  But Cillian is any character he plays.   That’s the difference.
I liked Margot before but after seeing this interview I completely love her.
Que película mas tonta no se cómo fue un éxito una película tan absurda me estoy refiriendo a barby
Thomas fucking shelby
Hmm I keep skipping 20sec to listen to Cilian..but it's Morgot every time..
A new great friend /conglamerate
Barbie was sexist like mcu now feminist means hatred and abuse of men no wonder 95% of men suffer domestic abuse and kill themselves woman actually raise there voice use emotion control and manipulate and wont let a man leave safely so scary its glorified aswell
My fellow AUSSIE Margot is soooo beautiful. So is Cillian :) Are these two in a movie together or is this Oppenheimer Vs Barbie?
I love how Margot Robbie is a fan of Cillian. I definitely need a movie with these two.
❤
She is totally fangirling. And Cillian mysterious as always
OMG she need to stop talking and listen a little more Cillian....!!!!! Gosh...... So frustrating 😤
Cillian n margot MUST do a movie together.
Красивая актриса! А мне нравится немецкая певица Jenice  https://youtube.com/shorts/BERP7iL0xdo?si=YYamezEDvkhMWH-w
How interesting about Americans having that muscularity in their mouths! They are a very expressive people.  Australians aren't as expressive, which is interesting as well, to have this cultural difference - it would be interesting to understand the cultural reason for this discrepancy.   It's also alarming that we are losing nuance in our language and expression.  (It's alarming if you understand the premise of George Orwell's book 1984) Youtube is to blame.  Like homogenised milk, it's all bland and tasteless.   These things also tie into why there are more and more remakes and fewer original ideas.    You be the detective and put the pieces together.
I dont believe margot does a number 2
💕
44:25Love her😍❤
I'm not a person to ever watch celebrities talk, I have to say, this conversation was so calming, pure and beautiful.
Great Details here and there, around 35 min mark theres some small curiosities i didnt noticed.
Barbie & Oppenheimer Opening Theaters July 21 2023
MARGOT LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE BARBIE OMGG THE CASTING WAS JUST PERFECT
Emily Blunt Matt Damon Robert Downey Jr & More
Ryan Gosling Will Ferrell Ariana Greenblatt & More
Did she really thought she will win a Oscar for such awful boring stupid movie omg girl please  That Barbie movie was a ripoff
+Bence de çok yakışıyoruz knk :
Tommy fookin Shelby.
Margot: I was worried my performance would feel plastic.
I'd of liked this interview if it wasnt for her interupting him in mid conversation. Apologies
Such a bizarre juxtaposition. A barbie movie, combined with a movie about nuclear bombs. Bizarre stuff.
Barbienheimer!
This was so amazing. Loved every second of it.
43:14 ... Why u came for
Katrina Kaif g is the most beautiful Charming girl in the whole universe ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️💖
It was a pity to see how Margot was interrupting Cillian. Cillian doesn’t deserve it.
Omg they are just brilliantly genius, the amount of their hard work and prep for the roles are impressive.
People always talk about Margot’s good looks and of course she is insanely beautiful but wow is she also such a beautiful intelligent human being. I could listen to her talk for hours
Now Barbenheimer is Real!!
ahora quiero que ell sea la hija revivida de polly gray en peaky blinders
I never understood how an actor-producer can be directed by and be the boss of the director at the same time. Can’t be easy
so the herbal cigarette, what change from normal cigarette, i didn’t understand
This is so much better than an interview.  Just like watching two talented and respectful friends having a chat over a coffee.   Great video.  Love both of these amazing actors.
Those who watched Shelby.
Can we take a moment to say hoe beautiful this pair looks 🤌🥰
And we all know who won the oscar
We need a Scarecrow and Harley movie now
grace and tommy shelby irl
did he keep his hands in his pockets?
He have no limitations ☠️
Thomas Shelby do what Thomas Shelby do because Thomas Shelby is Thomas $&@!ing Shelby.
When Margo talks about getting into the roll of Barbie lol I keep thinking of srg. Osiris “yeah you an artist” lol
I don’t read the script, the script reads me…
That was fascinating!
Only reason I rented Barbie was because of Ryan Gosling’s talent. Other than that, mehhh. It’s petty.  I adore Oppenheimer and all the casts and acting. It’s brilliant !  There is no comparison between these two movies.
I love it❤
O SENHOR é bom, um refúgio em tempos de angústia. Ele protege os que nele confiam,  Naum 1:07 🤎
If there's a new movie about Bonnie and Clyde, they'd be perfect for casting them in the lead roles
El es tan respetuoso, tan humilde que le dió demasiado lugar, me quedé con ganas de Oppenheimer... no me interesa Barbie en lo más mínimo..   ella es adorable...pero fue una exageración
Cilian must be a very comfortable conversational partner.
Dynamic duo
I wish we will be able to see more Margot and Greta movies together. 💝
British and Australian English ye?
I kind of was expecting more deep into Cillian's answers. I remember him saying that he doesn't enjoy when in interviews ask abput his personal life and he would like more questions about his job and this was that kind of interview. Maybe it was because Margot kind of interrupted him but I was expecting more from his responses.  Also I was so surprise for Margot's professionalism and intelligence and that she was the producer. Wow, so happy for her.0
He has to read The Selfish Gene by Richard Dawkinson. That is the origin of the concept of a "meme" and its a piece of genius in genetics. Brilliant concept.
This is quite brilliant!
I thought Barbie was absolute shit.
This pairing is everything ❤
I saw Barbie then Oppenheimer. I wish I had seen it the other way around.
They are both so cute and kind to each other.
Love Margot in this! She’s so real to fangirl lol but at the same time she’s super professional and asked great question and kept the conversation going! Great pairing!!! 😊
Looking at Cillian is enchanting. He has just too many beautiful features on one face. I’m glad he is speaking without sounding bored.
Time for a Barbie, Peaky Blinders cross over. Be interested to see a scene with Barbie and Alfie Solomons
Margot let cillian speak i wanna listen to him😫
Amanda Seyfried and Megan Fox please 😊
Murphy just has an aura my God pinky blinders and Oppenheimer was a stroll for him,because it fits his character
If i ever saw cillian murphy on street i would simply say in my brummie accent "alright mr shelby"
No brainer to put these two together.  But then they KILLED it!
They look very good couple
This is great and I love them both but some of the Barbenheimer memes on twitter were not it... Not to forget the way the official barbie account reacted to some of the tweets were insensitive and made me feel disappointed
One aussie and one irishman!   This is called globalisation
Watching these two amazing talents is like an unexpected  miracle! I usually dont even care to watch, or even try to remember actors name, much less seeing their sorry movies. But these two...again, miracles!💕💫💫🌹👑👑
Seems like Margot is always acting 😅
43:16
99.9% of population here is for Thomas not for Barbie 💥✨
I like how they're wearing the part as well, pink and black!
Whos the blonde?
At least Nicole Kidman still has time for Australia. Margot still blow ing Hollywood
Brains + Beauty... THAT is why Margo is on the top.
A really wonderful interview <3 As a little feedback to the videomakers, producers or recording team: you do a very good job, but the voice quality of the actors isn't good at all. I don't know why, but i guess it just could've been some reverb and echo problems acording to the room or noise situation. There is missing some warmth and dynamics, what just could mean, that the vocal tracks are overcompressed and denoised by a harsh threshold. I would love if you work on it :-*
Bro she literally looks like qtcinderella in the thumbnail it's crazy
Love them both but they’re showing so clearly that one is in their early 30s trying too hard to look smart and a good actor and the other in their late 40s just is!
Margot is constantly interrupting. This is so annoying. She’s asking a question and answers it herself.
when you've created a character to a plastic image of what a woman should be as an adult to cash in off society of all age levels., the first thing you need is an audience of dumbed down cash flow. aka Kardasians
Whatch "Intermission" one of his first ❤
Why does she keep interrupting him?  Get over yourself and let the man speak!!
Omg I enjoyed it soo so much
both talented actors. love them together.
Hi Alan doll yep original ken doll
Plus Margoe Robbie played Sharon Tate also❤
Myself my mam and my sister...we all wore pink to watch...I had Chanel type blazer...cool
My sister had massive Sindy house back in Late 80s took over sitting room had horse ranch bottom she still has in her loft now... sorry no girls for us just boys...think she sold on fb now, but the coolest dollhouse ever oh I had Jem in there all my Barbies great fun...I have memory of my dad watching music on telly George Harrison....I got my mind sent on you, playing with my Barbies in Sindy house, just memory think I was about six and daddy singing along to George, loved Beatles, has original White Album
Talking to myself yes...your genius as they say like studying I used to walk around my bedroom talking to myself for my oral exams leaving cert...I did well for my English, French and Irish orals also with other exams through years Reflexology had to explain what you doing with examination for your test, I would talk out sonnets for English exam...so wanted to be an actor ❤
STFU barbie! I'm so sick of it
it's so fun to see them get more comfortable with each other throughout the interview and how interested they are in each others strategies and views, ahhh it's just so inspiring to see <3
They look so good together
Nunca vi esse homem rindo atoa desse jeito
It's like they are having a silent battle.Can sense a little tension. Subliminal I guess 😂😂😂
Barbie 2 would lose the magic.
Margot for peaky blinders season 7 😂
Love my girl Margot but she talks a LOT 😭 😭
This made me feel good.  Thanks. That’s worth something.
Margot should have been Grace on Peaky Blinders
Excellent!! I love you both and everything involved.
Barbie was so disappointing. What a stupid script. Gosling was the only good thing about it.
Being so experienced in their fields and asking questions to one another is a wholesome interview to watch!
apparently Cillian asked his team if he could be paired up with Margot and when she was approached she immediately said yes. what a great conversation.
Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt are in a new movie together and now we need them together in a movie. Inception Barbenheimer.
She interrupted and spoke over him a lot.
"Fast 10 or whatever" yep, thats exactly how we feel about those movies as well.
Kinda dumb to add a comment to over 8000 comments, but here goes .. this is the very best behind-the-scenes video ever done. A conversation. Not an interview. A conversation beyond description with 2 of the best .. and I'm allowed to listen in. Thank you.
Love them!
Forget her .  We watching tommy shelby 🤍☠️
Cillian Murphy such a good looking dude
Wow ❤..
This was so good to see, love them ❤❤❤
Margot deserved an Oscar and not Emma. I said what i said.
Margot, me preparo como loca😂 para tener el mismo acento y actuaciones 😢😅
Love this, Margot is so cool🩷
Just when two beautiful speak to each other ❤
Margot should have at least been nominated, if not won, for Best Actress at the Oscars...
INCREDIBLE CHEMISTRY
An Australian and an Irish having a convo ❤ wow Margot and Cillian :-)
Im from Ireland. Cillian is a national treasure here.
Would love to marry cillian Murphy. Hes my dream man. Just perfect really and a phenomenal actor
“ ahhh…. There was a woman, yeah, who I really loved……. I got closed.   I nearly got  fucknnnn  everythingggg”

Margot is incredible! She is being very humble but if it wasn’t for her I don’t think the delivery would’ve been the same. Thank you Margot ❤
This was just so perfect ❤
Cillian is fucking hot
Margot’s husband punching the wall as we speak
Margot Robbie is an excellent interviewer. She asks great questions and lets Cilian andwer without interrupting him. Hernfollow up questions were insightful too.
Love it!!
Best crossover ever lol
Marget doesn't listen, she asks and dosen't give him a chance to talk
Cillian murphy is like I am too colorblind to wear pink
26:53 Americans are notably horrible at doing other nation's accents relative to those nations doing an American accent.
I did not hate "Barbie" as much as I hated "Poor Things." Cillian Murphy is a saint for enduring this interview. 🙂I stopped, started, and only completed the video because the comments made the video's end sound intriguing. Again, Cillian Murphy is deservedly loved on various levels including his tolerance and humility.
They fvcked
Mr Murphy should become an interviewer he is good! gets you interested in the conversation... Loved it
What a good couple
I literally enjoyed every second of this interesting, deep and genuine conversation! Both were interested to ask and to answer and to listen to each other. Thank you!!
By far my favourite acting role of Margot’s is in “I, Tonya”. So talented, such a complex character, very well done performance.
i think it always interesting how things like this become so popular. I remember back in 2020, Doom Eternal, a game about killing demons from hell, and Animal Crossing, a game about making a nice island with animal villagers to inhabit it, came out on the same day and it became a meme and probably made the 2 games way more popular than they would have been if they released on different days. And, since movies are way more popular than games, the Barbenheimer stuff probably gave it a way bigger boost than the Doom Eternal: New Horizons stuff did.
He's extremely suave And well mannered, very polite.    She was a bit "chatty". But most likely a bit unerved....i believe she truly admires him...
Amazing interview they’re so lovely
"Audiences don't like being told 'you should see this or you should see that'. They will decide and they will generate the interest themselves." - such a brilliant quote
Can she let Cillian Murphy talk more
meme inception a meme within a meme within a meme... and cillian was the one having the dream in inception and this is his meme... it goes on infinitely
i’m gonna miss the barbenheimer era of hollywood
Oppenheimer smoked Barbie 😎, Oppenheimer for the win
Margot asks great questions as the interview goes through. So specific, no vagueness. And gotta love Chris❤️. He is so humble and so interested in her even tho he played freaking Oppenheimer! Loved this interview💪🏼
Two of my favourites actors together. I’m sure it’s because I’m an Aussie with Irish blood. 😂 absolutely fantastic!
Barebenheimer - one to go in the books, best thing that happened in Summe 2023 🥹🫶🏽
i truly love the peace and quiet this whole conversation exudes. how wonderful it is to be able to speak and know that the other person is listening. how wonderful it is to see two lovers of film speak so candidly about the thing they love. really enjoyed this one. bless 🤍
Hunger Games Former President. Katniss Taylor Swift will beat him.
Cillian Murphy is a great actor. He can actually pretend he respects such a shitty movie as Barbie. Hey, if Margot Robbie liked it so much I propose she rewatchs it once a month.
I really enjoyed this interview.  Great and informative questions on both sides.  Love it❤❤❤❤love them❤❤❤
Cillian murphy is too hot to handle😊😅
Thomas Shelby and Harley Quinn having a chat. Something I never knew I needed.
It's been 3 months. Here I am, still watching it. Their talk is so worth watching, i even imagine they'll make a good reviewers/critics (?)(I'm not sure I'm using the correct term) what I mean is there's no empty/useless question being asked because they both so passionate about the work themselves that they share the progress and everything magnificently. I hope they'd work on the same project some day, films, tv show or anything. I think I'd be excited to watch it.
I've watched boh and yes amazing experience...finally as audience I can watch both and be excited at same way....i mean I watch everything and this was amazing for me
thank you for not cutting this down to 10 minutes
Cillian is sooooo  chill bruh
A meme with in a meme I love this interview 😂
She wouldn’t be where she is without her beauty because truth be told her acting ain’t nothing special
Tommy fucken shelby😬😬❤️❤️
I thought this was porn dude
this interview made me a Margo Robbie fan
So nice ❤
Excellent discussion. MsRobbie - why don*t you produce a Peaky Blinders movie? 💗💗💗🌸
Let him get a word in!!!!
Cillian is a great listener. One of a few big things that make him so likeable.
2023 was their year. Period.
44:20 All peaky blinders fans echoing Margott Robbie’s feelings!!
All Men Love Cillain Murphy.
PEAKY FUCKING BLINDER
43:18 the main thing 🔥🔥
Shes too much for me. Always talking ....
Foking Loved this!
YouTube is the savior ❤❤❤
Margot completed killed it as Tonya harding. I think that was am underrated movie
they would be great acting together
So class
She talks too much. Cillian is such a gentleman. You can tell the difference in class between the two imo.
here after his big oscar win
Both come across as beautiful artists 🙏
Wooow what a conversation ❤
Barbie sucked, neo feminist garbage
If you went to see Barbie as a 13+ person, you have a problem.
they both seem so nervous of each other and also in awe of each other
Great to see you doing well with the mastermind and other streams! I know how much you work you put into it and recall you talking about it during last year’s PTYA cohort. Keep it up!
I’ve been absolutely enthralled by Cillian since I saw 28 Days Later in the theater, and I find it fascinating that he still covers his mouth so much when he’s being himself. He shies away in some way in every interview I’ve ever seen him in, and yet, he can play a villain so brilliantly. He’s just addictive and a joy to watch. Love all the praise he’s getting (and an Oscar nom and win, FINALLY!).
What a great mix of these 2 fabulous actors
barbie did good only because of oppenhiemer ,agree or die
He won. ❤
This was such a joy to watch, enjoying it almost as much as both movies
She's not maintaining eye contact with the thomas shelby..if she is, ❤ for sure
What a Lovely Conversation between two Lovely Lovely Generous Souls ❤❤❤❤❤ Loved the Calmness a lot that speaks to their Personalities 😊
What a fuckin joke
He did not answer one question completely.. she kept cutting him off!! Im not underestimating how intimidating  the whole encounter could be yet some dialogue coaching should be done before these productions.
Margot asking to Cillian about Thomas Shelby timing 43:12 Thank me later
You can tell how star struck Margo is and so excited she is to nerd out and talk about cinema with cillian. It’s so wholesome. Loved this pairing. ❤
Cillian sounds like an intellectual
This was honestly really pleasant
And I'm sure Margot Robbie would be open to playing a role in a Peaky Blinders play-off.  Just saying ❤
If you're gonna have a play-off movie to Peaky Blinders, please continue on with the Cillian and Anya Taylor-Joy adversaries.  She was your match.
Irish and Australian accent ❤
Is it me or Margo was nervous and at times flirtatious? I think she likes him ☺️. They would make a cute couple to be in a romcom
this was so polite I just loved it. two intelligent super thoughtful people. wow i LOVED THIS!
Both so charming and complimentary and sophisticated
OK I love Nolan and Gerwig but I don’t think nobody was waiting for the next Gerwig film. If you ask most filmgoers they probably wouldn’t know who Greta is. That’s just the way it is. But who knows after another decade or so of filmmaking she might be a  Christopher Nolan.
Great pairing of actors! This was really interesting and fun to listen to.
Love her but that jacket?!? awful
Cillian is such a great listener here
one of best actors of decade if not best.
Happy to say I participated in "Barbenheimer". Loved both films. A perfect pairing of "oil and water".
because of this video i subscribed
Whole video is about  margot  and cillian admiring their directors greta and nolan
Unpopular opinion - Barbie was not that good.
does anyone know which episode of this american life robbie is referring to by any chance? (about the woman with no introspection)
Have...have you worked with IMAX!.?
You r a actress not actor
Please bring back perky blinders ❤😂🎉😢😮😅
She is so fit hot sexy beautiful gorgeous dam ❤😂🎉😢😮😅
Excellent conversation! I think from the casts and crews of both movies, this was the pairing that would work. Maybe Emma Thomas and Greta too. Not sure how much Emma opens up though. Part of me was hoping when the subject of a Peaky Blinders movie came up, it should have gone “well, if you don’t do that, you can be a Ken in any Barbie 2” 😂 He has done small parts in the past - even uncredited. Tron Legacy for example.
I watched Barbie with my best friend, I cried like a baby with billie’s song in that scene, adored it. Then I just entered another room and watched Oppenheimer, a fucking masterpiece.
43:17, that's what I wanted to hear from their conversation ❤
maybe you'll meet her one day????
Cillian was so good in 28 days later.  Oppenheimer was so boring.
Margot fangirling over Tommy Shelby was so cute I can relate to her! We all indeed love Peaky Blinders🥰
Love the total professionalism, “I prep like a psychopath”
A maior junção de atores de todos os tempos ❤❤❤❤❤
the fact they are also both Batman villains is so perfect
"Hi Allen" haha, love Allen!
43:14 Thank me later! #peakyblinders
Bro how can two people be so violently attractive???
someone can put me a timecode of all the questions ?
It feels like she secretly hates Nolan and cillian and isveing forced to chat
I would have watched Oppenheimer when it came out had I realized Cillian Murphy was in it. I watched him in Sunshine....😮 That's when I became a fan of his acting ability!!
Peaky blinders chat @43:20
Where's the peaky blinders chat?
10:45... Ah so cute of Cillian to actually say both movies were good, while clearly one was a masterpiece and the other just pretty terrible. I thought Barbie was the most disappointing movie in .such a long time. With Robbie and Gosling I expected a clever script, great dialogue and some fun moments in between. It turned out to be a dreadful experience
Margot using the word "like" every 15 seconds is just off-putting. Cillian's talent finally being recognized is awesome.
Loved watching him win the academy award. Always been attracted to his intelligence and discrete charm.
She’s so gorgeous inside and out
❤
This interview, conversation is so much more interesting and insightful and any interview of actor/actress by the journalist....Cillian and Margot so so comfortable in each other companies!
CM is a great actor, unlike De Niro or Joaquin Phoenix, he actually looks like he wants to be sitting there...
Now i wanna rewatch peaky blinders 😂
If there is a next Barbie movie, please not so much PINK. Pretty please.
Margot is a bit shy herself, so I see why Cillian felt at ease with her.
I loved this! You work so hard and do so well regulating your blood sugars. Happy to hear  your reading hours were higher!
Margot asking: “what was peaky blinders like” also Margot: doesn’t let him finish a damn sentence or tell us what peaky blinders was like
It drove me crazy that Margot dominated a majority of this conversation. Like shut up sometimes and let Cillian complete his entire thought. 😭 I appreciated her questions and perspective on some things, but she just talked or cut him off way too often.
Its not just the movie that are different its their personnality and i love it, who else than another actor could ask pertinent questions ? They are probably the one that are the more curious about other actors way of thinking and working, really nice cast
Anyone else felt that Margot talked a lot when one really wanted to hear more from Cillian?
did someone notice he didn't say barbie once in the whole interview
Tommy Shelby does and amazing Cillian Murphy impersonation. It’s uncanny.
could easily picture Cillian working with Greta Gerwig and Margot working on a Nolan film in the future
oh my margot talks a lot! she asks a question to cillian and automatically takes over that answer too. cillian you are a kind soul:)
I am indescribably happy that Cillian Murphy is finally in the spotlight, and I am deeply sorry it's happening 'late.' He should have received an Oscar for his portrayal in Peaky Blinders long ago. I believe the role of Oppenheimer didn't necessarily suit him, but he fantastically portrayed the role of the manic physicist. Still, I plead for compensation for his portrayal in Peaky Blinders!!!  Nevertheless, I believe the film mainly won the Oscar because it perfectly illustrates - with an educational purpose - what would happen if atomic or hydrogen bombs were dropped on humanity now. It would be unstoppable and devastating. A more relevant film couldn't have won the Oscar.
Me my husband and our son watched these two movies we both love it
I love that this was put together
Thomas Shelby
Watched Cillian in an older film from 2010 I think where he played a husband and wife. It's called Peacock and he was amazing., playing a man with a split personality and didn't really know it. If you haven't seen it yet you should really check it out. Great range Cillian. Love you, so happy for all your awards.🎉 ❤❤❤🎉😊congratulations
people realizing they went to see a feminist movie: 🤡
Cillian Murphy looks whiter than Margot
Actor on Actress.... the Heading is SO WRONG , 'Actor on Actor ??? She is a Female !!!
I need them both together in a movie!
I'm so glad i was alive during the Barbenheimer time, it was actually amazing.
Margot: Please do it, please?
Best interview ever!
Peaky Blinders movie please - Ghanks Margie
These are two people without any egos here, comfortable in themselves, both actually nice people both with  a similar background, your average Irishman most of us are ,and a regular Australian woman....I believe too that they both are Nolan/Gerwig people,sounding to me both film sets were very happy places and you could see a Murphy/Robbie movie soon  with either Gerwig or Nolan directing
Nothing as interesting as to very smart, talented people allowing each other to present ideas start to finish. Loved it & them both.
44:06
Make all the actors on actors this long 🙏 !
Cillian Murphy didn't win an Oscar, the Oscar won Cillian Murphy.
Who's here after Cillian Murphy won the Oscar !!
she is very flirty with him. but he's chill
batman villain
And He's Worth It....
Ironically both of them had been villain in Batman Universe Scarecrow & Harley Quinn
oppenheimer
There is sexual tension here...
CM deserves his flowers.. everyone knows him as Shelby.. but he played so many other characters prior..
I love seeing him. He looked like he was so relaxed in this interview
Did anyone else notice that one of the Kens was colonel ben younger 😂
If you want the discution about Peaky Blinders. 44.13
I saw the classic Pink Floyd album cover with Oppenheimer on fire shaking hands with Barbie in a cowboy hat, and it wordlessly summed up the summer.
Two of the most classy and attractive people to ever exist.
Margot Robbie, Happy Barbie`s Day ) in a good sense of the word )  Margot, I feel you!  P.S. Let`s get married 💍
she's really beautiful
Margot is indeed mid. She didn't know that the script was in FPP
What a charming pairing. Loved every second of this.
Imagine how ugly everyone feels while being in the room with these two.  😅
Sometimes i just forget that she is australian... I dont really think about it, until she says "Hey how you GOING"
Nice
Barbie is nothing more then excrement on film for those that do not like cinema, however Margo is a fine actress. How difficult it must have been for the 10 year old to have written the script for this pile of dung heap?
Nudity..r*pe.. feminist..man hating..both movies 👎🏼
Margot Robbie,  Happy Ladies day! )  I will give a hundred lives for yours )  P.S. Let`s get married 💍
aw it was so nice and sweet to hear both of them talk in a genuine and immersive manner ❤️ i hope we get more of em soon :)
43:22 peaky blinders ref
Margot and Cillian are actually Barbie and Ken in real life
This supposed to be kind of a meme pairing, but the thumbnail is legit 🔥
For whole interview I couldn’t stop myself thinking how weird it would be if a cillian murphy is  playing a ken in barbie sequel
And I’ve seen the old movie  “My girl Friday “ and it’s hilariously interesting for the time
I never saw peaky blinders in full just many clips on you tube 💙I fell in love with Cillian and the show.  You tube is the best! I don’t do social media unless FB and it’s absolutely necessary. Fabulous interview I subscribed and just two brilliant actors 🎉
Obviously, these are two great-looking people -- but best of all, they're very bright, talented and interesting/interested.
Hear me out ; Cillian and Margot have a baby.  ? I know , greatness
Such a pleasant episode this was 🫂🪽
Is it thomas shelby or cillian can't understand 😂😂
Excitable
не перебивай моего Киллиана😭😭
The amount of comments here that are full of starstruck crap and idolising others is ridiculous. Really people need to get a life, these are just two people having a conversation, but somehow people find epic comments to make about it all, its really nothing.
Barbie is simply unwatchable unless you are a card carrying member of the Demoncrap Party.
W Oppenheimer
Margot Robbie is british?!  EDIT: AUSTRALIAN?!?!
Ooooh the chemistry between them!
Margot, prettiest woman in history
Cilian Murphy ♥️
I have not inner voice
Hahaha that is cool to hear that Margot Robbie is a “Peaky Blinder” fan
Waooo what a pair two of them,,who idea it was,,its amazing
I love seeing Margot’s subtle eye tell reaction to Cillian telling her Christopher Nolan wrote the whole Oppenheimer script all in the first person. “Ooh I’ll have that” 😂
I hate the way they talk seriously about the movie, as if it belongs in the same breath as Oppenheimer. Barbie was gratuitous, even by its own standards, and what plot it had was so lazily thought out that it left me feeling short-changed. Should’ve stuck with a celebratory musical feel, as the set design and song numbers were incredible. But it utterly lacked depth.
I do like both of those actors, they are brilliant. Such a shame she talks all the time and interrupts him over and over again. Sometimes he couldn't even finish the point of the question.I guess it's in her nature.  Cant wait to see more films :)
Yeah
They started talking about peaky blinders at 43:15. You are welcome.
The exact same thing that happened to Margot in the hot London cinema happened to me. Were they doing it on purpose? I was about to hurl by the time the credits rolled around.......
43:10 here's the one u r searching for  Thanks me later👍
Does anyone notice that both of them played in Batman Franchise Cillian Murphy as Scarecrow and Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn... 😂😂😂😅😅😅
How about Scarecrow and Harley Quinn??? That's interesting baby!!!
Same name as me!
pure cinema

Your are weak to me & my people…
WB knew how to market the Barbie movie, saw an opportunity and took it. They knew there are lots of dumb girls who would turn up in pink to watch that crap to just to show their femininity 🤡
How generously these two actors described about cinema, vision, projection & the impact of it worldwide. Like Cillian said you can’t force people to watch this or that you build their own interests. For me it a deep quote here because whether you’re an intellectual or a philosophical person who has a huge knowledge about craft and related field or you just a simple human who enjoys whether it comes in their way.  That’s the humbleness connect people so easily with you, Still on a high castle and you’re not projecting your own views or ideology on someone that if you’re supreme then they have to obey you.  One of the finest interview I’ve seen laterally.
Elle ai belle bravo
asking what the parents think is one of the many things that make this forum special
Margot didn’t even let him speak.. 😢 she was cutting him in almost every sentence.
We want more peaky blinders
👏🏻👏🏻🤩
Cillian Murphy was my favorite when I first saw him in Christopher Nolan’s dark knight movies
He is our modern day Sean Connery, and Robbie is just a stunning person and loved her in all her roles
9:44 I'd guess it takes a hell lot of good parenting to have such relationship with teenage boys that they are still interested in having funny conversations with you! Keep it up parents determined at it!
thomas shelby is playing cillian murphy ya..
You don't realize how much prep and work goes into creating a compelling character. Eye opening and easy to digest
The line by Margot Robbie "Hopefully not the last time", at the end truly defined how much she admires Cillian as an Actor
I have three questions.   1. Why is Barbie not nominated in the original screenplay category for an Oscar? If it’s based on a work, explain to me what that written work is.   2. Why was Margot Robbie not nominated for an Oscar?   3. Why oh why was Greta Gerwig not given a best director nomination?
Sci fi in reverse, dimention and like  never growing up? Logic? Everyone's parents.
I just love how natural, open and zero arrogant are them, both together.
Por qué ella lo interrumpe demasiado? Parece nerviosa...🤔
Off topic about peaky blinders 45:00
Cillian Murphy=Thomas Shelby  Margot Robbie=BARBIE Sorry but Cillian is in another level. And they're in the same interview 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
Sorry but u can’t compare Oppenheimer with Barbie. Two great movies but Oppenheimer is on another level
His natural aging and lines are so beautiful. She is also beautiful but looks like a walking filter. I just ... love what is natural.
Excellent conversation by two of current favorite actors.
Eu não consigo entender nada do que ela fala.
TOMMY! arthur's comin' to your SET he's got a link JUNK on his socks!
Australian English definitely isn't closer to American English. It's more like 19th century London. Cillian's natural English is closer ro American English than Margot's is.   Americans do have a hard time with Australian English, generally speaking, I think in large part because we just don't hear it that frequently, and we tend to have a hard time telling it apart from some southern British English -- which probably seems ridiculous to Brits and Aussies.
I loved both movies❤ Two incredible actors
Looking as some previews for 2024 movies, so-o-o much GCI in movies. I really appreciate the in-camera ethic of Greta Gerwig and Christopher Nolan. Lovely Actors on Actors session.
omg Margot is so wise, smart, intelligent, with initiative, and poised
Omg, after two months I finally got around watching it. Before playing I was like “oh 50 minutes, that’s kinda long” but the first few minutes were enough to realize that it wasn’t gonna be enough! What a fantastic interview! It’s like Barbeheimer came full circle. You can see the respect between them, how Margot was a fan of Cillian’s work and, especially, how Cillian, who’s quite shy and discreet, totally opened up and was happy to be there with her. Whoever came up with this idea is a genius
Am I the only one who thinks Cillian is incredibly sexy?
Imagine what their children what look like. We would need a new beauty scale
Murphy scared can't reveal robbie's not worthy of appreciation.
I'm sure she's seen the "Hi Barbie Heil Hitler" meme
she doesn't give him space to fully express - people gotta learn to just shut up and be in silence sometimes
Has anybody else recognized the chemistry between these two ? 🙈😛🥰
Peaky Blinders 🔛🔝
Yeah smoking
Margot Robbie has reached the stage for Australian women where their beauty declines fast
barbie was the worst.
Refreshing
god i love them both so much, just seeing them together in this video makes me wanna dieeeee (if they ever are in a movie together i do Not care what it is, i Will Watch it)
Barbie movie get viewed at Japan  And But oppenheimer on that history...🇯🇵💀
Just as Johnny Depp was Tim Burton's muse, Cillian Murphy is Chris Nolan's muse.
43:13 Save your time. Thanks me later
Got damn it I want hear about 28 Days Later!!!!
“Reasonably successful” 😂
This talk is pure GOLD.
I loved the humbleness of cillian when he was just listening to margot speaking about barbie. It shows you that he is not a guy with arrogance or ego. Loved it!!
Its interesting how theses guys try to justify themselves...
LOOOVE Margot to pieces but she interrupts Cilian way too much :/ whereas he was just quietly listening to her till she finished talking.
It was like only margot is talking 🥲
I thought I’d get bored in places watching this but it’s was fascinating and I’ve listened so intently to their conversation and I feel so much more respect for them both in understanding how they prepare for the role. They are both brilliant - it feels relaxed and engaging to watch them.
20:24 this part is fun! You can see how the artist do their preparation for the movie they gonna work with
variety rly let 2 A listers interview each other, and profit from it. sheesh
You can see how Margot is very big fan of Cillian Murphy's by seeing her excitement toward it's conversation, she know him so much
10:58 it's about talking 2 human talk being part of path fate together at the same path creating new legend phenomenon for the world fate, they both is connected and have that same level consciousness, i can see how grateful they are being part of humanity's timeline project
They are both on the same level and i didnt realize how much i love them as actors until they got there big moves
Who would have thought that Harley Quinn & Scarecrow would be in the same room😂
great video, loved this, wonderful stuff, but i gotta say i burst out laughing at 28:36 cause at first listen i though Cillian said "he was such a slut" in referring to Oppenheimer
A little too much talking about that stupid Barbie movie
Really cant imagine Cillian watching barbie, but id love to see it!
Look at Harley Quinn and the Scarecrow teaming up to take down Batman.
I had to look up what a boiler suit was. It's coveralls. In case anyone else didn't know that.
Cilian murphy looks more good in thomas shelby haircut in this haircut he is looking normal
It won't be long that we won't remember that these two movies were even comparable. One is already a classic in the making, the other is just another one-summer blockbuster.
When Barbie & Oppenheimer have a conversation. 🫶
I wish she had asked him more. I wanted to know more :( like yes Margot cool but let him talk pleaaaase. Felt one sided.
Peaky Blinders segment 43:25
please let cillian talk, Margot
43:12
Cillian is clearly a listener and waits his turn to respond thoughtfully, while Margot is clearly used to back-and-forth chit-chat. Two conversation styles. My one complaint with this (my opinion) is that I watched this for Cillian, so to have Margot consistently adding her input while he's trying to respond to a question regarding his experience was frustrating (especially because he is fairly reserved and not a limelight seeker)
❤❤❤❤
31:30
was that the most beautiful interview ive seen? so sweet😊
What a wonderful conversation. I'm grateful to them both for doing this. I'm not sure why It didn't occur to me that this pairing had to be inevitable.
بدنا ترجمه
We NEED these two in a tragi-comedy film together
She's great. Go, Margot!
I did Barbenheimer back to back at imax, it was THE BEST cinema experience of my life. Funniest thing about those movies is that the marketing did not do them justice. I was most excited for Oppenheimer, but found that I liked Barbie more and visa-versa for my GF. We both loved both films, but came out of them realizing how deep each movie was, and far deeper than we could have ever expected.  We had totally different ideas of what these movies were and came out a mess not realizing how wrong we both were. Was a great experience for both of us.
the best thing i find on the internet
he doesn't have a phone..??lol
Omg
the most harmonious and elegant session between a woman and a man I have ever seen on the Internet
A beautiful couple
Without Oppenhimer being juxtaposed next to the Barbie movie release, who would have cared to watch Oppenhimer? It's weird how they turned it into a competition
People that watched the show knows for a fact that it hasn’t ended yet. The show was supposed to have 7 seasons, but Steven Knight decided to cancel the seventh season because of Covid that made things difficult at the time; so instead they decided to make six seasons + a movie that will wrap up everything. The movie is not a spin off. It will conclude the series that still had some loose ends to tie, such as Oswald Mosley, Jack Nelson, those Billy Boys, Gina Gray + Finn Shelby. They need to wrap up all these antagonists in a 2hrs movie.
I have a question.. HOW IS IT ALLOWED, to start a video out, with a photoshoot of two of the most charismatic and sexy actors on this end of eternity?. yall are criminals xD
Shit actress
I wasn't really itching for the next Greta Gerwig film but ok.
Два моих любимых актера в одном кадре! Это то что я хотела ❤❤❤❤❤
Yeah yeah yeah... 🙂🙎‍♂️
Amazing actors!!
CILLIAN YOU CAN TELL HES A SHY TYPE AND THAT MAKES HIM A GOOD LISTENER ,NEVER INTERRUPTS AND DIFFICULTY MAKING LONG EYE CONTACT  AND MARGOT A GOOD FLOWY SPEECH WITH LESS SPACES IN BETWEEN FRASES BUT COULD USE A BIT OF A PATIENTS LISTENING
29:12 Como fue el interpretar a Barbie
Oppenheimer won... BY ORDAH OF THE PEAAKY FOOKIN BLINDERS
Wtf, that's not like she killed him alone and bare hands.. she shot him in the head when he was already done, a child could have done that wtf was this vidéo about?  And idk why people are so mad about SS killing Batman.. and no one talks about them killing flash and superman !
At 43:12 about Peaky Blinders
Great interview. I just wrote a screenplay and to hear Margot talk about Greta's writing and soft pitch process was brilliant and inspiring.
Cillian Murphy's voice is so masculine 💪🏼 ... And this man is so humble and classy... Tommy Shelby getting his due respect all over the world...
Omg what boots is Cillian wearing?
Man, she doesn’t let him finish one sentence. It’s like my marriage.
It is a bit frustrating that she hides that she is feeling a bit of intimidated or something and tries to cover it by interrupting him every time. Let the man speak. His rhythm is just slower and more reflected.
Cillian's rizz on Margot is something I needed in my life.
14:47 Margot robbie casually getting dreamy in Cillians Eyes. haha
FANTASTIC
Stop Asking Who’s Still Watching!  We Never Stop Watching To This MASTERPIECE!!.-
I love them. She is so precious and he is phenomenal
I LOVE that she asked about peaky blinders lmao
43:16 it's what you're looking for
43:14 omgg this! Margot loves peaky blinders❤
Losing her accent
He's Such an intelligent and kind Man He listens to her carefully. And she's so annoying Interrupting every time. Just shut the fuck up and let him talk already
"The wolf of wall street"
She is trying so hard to convince him that they have done something huge 😅 but he is so cool
Bro i can't find the part why i came here for💀
If u r here for the Peaky Blinder's talk it's at 43:11 😎
I didn’t want this video to end 💕
43:00 men of our culture came here 😊
Who comes here after that Instagram reel 🌝🌝🌝  and that part in 43:15 😉.. Thank me later ✌
Thanks now I love Margot Robbie even more. Her personality, her work ethics and off course her looks. What’s there that’s not to like?
Damn... She is talking to much
It is a gift I never thought I needed. Just a joy of conversation of two people. Variety! 48 something minutes is too short, please consider to extend
43:15 peaky blinders discussion
Them trying to make cinema into something it isn't is crinch. We should all just be able to rent the movie day 1 and watch them on our crappy tv devices.
Some real BS coming from Margot Robie's mouth.
I’m here for Thomas F*ckin Shelby
POV: Scarecrow and Harley Quinn interview each other.
One of the finest movie ever produce.
She is so boring and taking 99.9% time for blablabla
Çok iyi
❤❤❤
Margots bone structure is perfect
This was so beautiful to watch. Cillian Murphy and Margot Robbie talking about the process, the directing, casting and all of it just makes the already incredible Barbenheimer phenomenon even more incredible and exciting. This was joyful.
I'm surprised by what Margot Robbie did so much, it seems unfair that she didn't appear at the Oscars, but Oppenheimer? They are both good movies and deserve that.
imagine if they had roles in a series like Twin Peaks.
She is just like us asking for a peaky blinders movies
Barbenheimer united
Margot thanks for asking about Peaky Blinders. I’m from Melbourne Australia & I loved Cillian as Thomas Selby. I wanted to cry when it finished. There has to be a continuation etc. A movie I want to know where Thomas went & what happened. Plz Cillian do it for all the fans of this series. ❤
Either Murphy didnt see much of Barbie or any of Margots past movies.. or he was being polite and not probing too much.
Margot MUST look like her daddy 😂  Her mom looks great btw , they just dont much resemble to me.
When actors go do regular interviews, i want this DEPTH and caliber of questions EVERY time. No exaggeration.
i couldn't find that girl said "in my opinion there are two kind of people in this world"
Barbenheimer did well and one thing is for sure that if we do get the Snyderverse restored, Zack and whoever will hold the rights to DC or cleanse WB of all the corruption from within the studio should look into having Cillian Murphy cast as Brainiac for Man of Steel 2 and have him go head to head with Henry Cavill and Sasha Calle on set. Plus, Anne Hathaway and Jesse Eisenberg should reunite (since Rio 1 and 2) as villains Silver Banshee and Lex Luthor as well as having Gerald Butler, Ed Skrein, or hell, even Luke Cage actor Mike Colter play Metallo. #restorethesnyderverse #revivemanofsteel2 #makecousinsofsteelwithhenryandsasha #liveactionmanofsteel2 #cillianmurphybrainiac
45:22 Cilian slid right out of talking about himself/Peaky
How Margot’s face lights up when Cillian says he’s open to a Peaky Blinders movie
the barbie pr campaign cost 150million sooo
BAREBENHEIMER ❤😂
Im the 2nd type of people who s never seen the PB but from other film of Cillian i love his works and his personality❤
2:27
No way, John Cena Popped in mid shooting fast 10 , I wouldve😂😂😂 broken down laughing 😅😅
Margot was perfect for this
Cillian Murphy is absolutely an amazing actor, his career is totally changed after the peaky blinders.
Apparently, it was Cillian's team that reached out to Variety asking for the pairing, and I find that super wholesome.

Look who's here! The "mid" one.
OK that girl did a good dc movie, (the crazy one) and that guy did a good airplane movie, (he was nuts too). Other than that, what's the big deal?
Eww no he had his eyes "Done "  surgeries  Looks strange
You 2 are all that n a bag of chips 💙💯
Barbie was a FEMINAZI piece of tripe and people know that!
Margot Robbie's role in Babylon opened her acting to me personally in a whole new level. After that, definitely one of my top 10 actors ever.
Thespians on Thespians
I'm a simple man , i see Cillian Murphy i watch it❤
9:46 a meta meme
what does Thomas Shelby in here bro?
It's a shame theu paired these movies together. Barbie looks like an awful movie.
Musicals suck.. Just sayin. Musicals aren't movies.
Los ameeee❤❤❤
Ay fuertísimo acabo de caer en cuenta que ambos son villanos de Batman ! Jajajaj 😮🤯
43:13 yall should see
La diferencia entre el tipo de preguntas y la escucha entre uno y el otro.
Barbie was garbage
Я обожаю их!!! Прекрасные актеры, невероятной красоты люди, как внешне, так и духовно !!!❤
So we’re all shipping for Margot Robbie and Cillian in 28 years later and Cillian as the Mojo Dojo Casa House Alpha Ken in Barbie 2 right? Oh yeah and Ryan bieng in both obviously. Also Matel what about Christopher Nolan making a Hot wheels movie?
In the first half of the interview Margot Robbie acts like she made a superior movie just because she had a marketing success. Now with the globes , Oscars etc everyone will get what they deserve. Cillian is so polite and patient and basically he is proving who is the better man
What's changed, We came back
It was great ❤
I did not realize he was scarecrow....
43:13 I was waiting for this moment ❤
*Thomas Shelby vs Harley Quinn*
She was a producer as well?
The two highest cheekbones in the game
My best
A Tribute for the Movies Just made for all of you "Cillian Murphy, Margot Robbie, Christopher Nolan & Greta Gerwig and the cast" and the World #OpenBarbieheimer "OpenBarbieheimer " #youtube @Enrichpathways  https://youtu.be/uKX1kjhij00?si=mxG6RmnpS4gAdisw
I love that Cillian just came dressed in black. He is not an extrovert at all.
Such a good looking people
Complete respect to both of them. They made amazing job, show their talent. Brilliant actor&actress and kind, humble humanbeings. Love you both! Thanks for giving us those incredible movies! Please create more stuff, people will watch <3
❤ Cillian Murphy ❤
The favourite color to steal china is black,keep trying taylor swift's pupeeters 😂
The best interview I've ever seen!!
Great episode of A on A with these two. I mean, they are in 2023's biggest movies of the year and thanks to them, people went to the cinema.
Two smart people listening to each other🎉
Ummm  Okay
Cillian Murphy is so handsome, beautiful, charming and talented. He is a brilliant Actor and I hope he wins the Oscar.
Barbie was boring. Margot isn't.
this is an amazing pair up. even out with the barbenheimer event they are a good duo and it would be great to see these two in a production together sometime. would be crazy if they got Cillian in the possible Barbie 2 they discussed or Margot in the Peaky movie, would be great cameos and could be a really good actor-to-actor bond.
If I ever saw Robbie on the street, I'd always yell out, "Hey Tonya" or "Hey Duchess", this Barbie thing though...so weird.  Though Murphy was always a talented actor - Nolan was one of the first to finally feature him, but he was dynamite in 28 Days Later and The Wind That Shakes the Barley.
Margilian Murbbie😮😮😮❤❤
So glad I came across this. It's absolutely brilliant and engaging 👌❤😊
Margot was very annoying at times 🙄
WHAT is the MUSIC at the BEGINNING??????
There's so much creative energy talking  for one another in terms of what movies they have made and how they tell the process of creating their characters just so interesting margot robbie was so curious and humble as Cilian likewise and its just alot of fun creative chat between them its intriguing ❤  Would love to see the interview between Ryan Gosling and Robert Downney Jr. Too what a great chat that would be❤
Actors on actors: That’s what she said
Barbie wasn’t a cultural phenomenon 😂.. it was a marketing phenomenon.
Who thinks that Thomas Shelby kind of looks like Michael Jackson
Omgggg let Cilian talk!!!!!!
Girl leave Barbie alone as one movie. It will say more on its own than squeezing more out of it😂
Margot Robbie is mid.
Margot's fake involvement here is jarring
that was so delightful
Im sure her Barbie was no stretch after Harley Quinn ;)
Margot Robbie is like RDJ. They talk at you, a lot
Yeeeah.
Can we get Vera farminga?!!
By order of the foking peakey blinders 😤
Harley quinn and the scarecrow
How is she so gorgeous yet so down to earth omg
Fabulous session! 🤩🤩 Sequels are not always a good idea.
Cillian Murphy always seemed to me to be very bright. I'm waiting for a weekend when I have 3 hours to watch Oppenheimer. I quit watching Barbie after about 30-40 minutes, it seemed fragmented and I wasn't interested in the effects. A good film is a good story.
loved Peaky Blinders.... and Oppenheimer Cillian....  Margot Barby is on my list
Cillian was lovely.His Shy side and kindness is great considering his amazing acting performances. I know Barbie was the other movie at this time but Margo's questions etc....will not set the test of time. Maybe have another actor with him.
What a crap movie
Tbh I really think they should film something after peaky blinders like a movie because there’s just so much more to the story
Super interesting interview between actors. Both, great actors!           By the way, I loved Peaky Blinders.
When I watched it in a cinema on a very hot day the air con was broken too.  Bags of ice were being handed out. What's going on with British cinemas?
Really interesting interviews between actors!!
HI barbie! HI fission! Did you see my contribution?.??
Props to Cillian Murphy, it would be hard for many people to not just sit there nodding and staring with their mouths open saying, "Uh huh." Her beauty is just so mesmerizing and uncommon.
I want her shoes
I havenʻt seen either movie yet. I guess the pairing of both movies had no choice but to debut as blockbusters this past summer because what else was there? I am not a Barbie fan i intend to watch it soon just because. I am hoping itʻs hella funneeee. Oppenheimer doesnʻt impress me in terms of content because itʻs a history that shall never be forgotten. I look forward to the actors portrayals.  Bravo🎉
I want to see Cillian with Sebastian Stan together. Lol they would stare at everyone souls.
I can literally listen to Cillian Murphy talking for like the whole day ....
did any of the barbie actors ever watch barbie movies or barbie in the dreamhouse? i always thought they would
Margot is so hot
One of the best match
Miss Robbie will come again. Babylon was a great film. Sadly filmgoers didnt like it. I loved it. Shes a star. Cillian is as well. Oppenheimer was a stunning film.
Don't wear f*cking maks! Only victims and fascists are wearing masks! 👎 Really good movie when it comes to brainwashing people, definitely one of the best propaganda movies alltime, indeed. 🤦‍♂
🎠💕🎠1/24/24 TO: M. ROBBIE U R AN EXCEPTIONAL ACTRESS N EVERYTHING U DO GIRL🎉DONT LET THIS GOOF BY OSCAR NOMINATIONS MAKE U DOUBT 🌟YOURSELF 🌟 🕊️SHARON C CHARLOTTE NC 🐕‍🦺🏇
why is it so sad when he says “remember when heath breaks into the bank” 😢 iconic scene iconic role iconic actor
Genial!!!!
Can anyone tell why Robbie the actress is being promoted so much?  Totally untalented actress, no awards whatsoever. And yet they serve her up and make us "eat" her.

Scarecrow & Harley Quinn
Great job. I'll probably make a Barbie REPLAY out of the movie
Scarecrow and Harley Quinn in the same room
The lack of chemistry is actually kinda iconic
Chris Nolan should have Margot in his next film
Excellent interview except for the comments about Emily, she doesn't seem charming at all, especially when she fat shames service workers, we don't all have the money to be skinny and pretty and she should be more aware of her privilege, when she is interacting with regular people. ie, FANS.
Two beautiful people talking
Tommy fucking Shelby
"And I do know what a meme is. Now I know that there are memes about me not knowing what a meme is."
I was in Ukraine when I watched Oppenheimer. In the middle of the movie, the air raid alarm at the cinema went off, so employees asked us to leave or stay at our own risk. Everyone decided to stay, and in 5 minutes, there was a scene of the test explosion. Jesus, that was something so immersive that even Nolan couldn't imagine
I really like how much Margot Robbie's industry knowledge comes through in this
Congratulations Cillian on your Oscar nomination!
Dios margot dejalo hablar
I have also never seen Peaky Blinders, but know him from Peaky Blinders. Love Margot, as a fellow Aussie. Cool that she also produced the Barbie movie. Barbie is on my to watch list.
They are so good! Love them 🤍
Both are brilliant! But listening how Margot talk about her work, dreaming big and yet down to earth and careful for every detail and her passion and radiant vibes which make everything to look so easy and fun, really set her apart. She is my personal #1 and I'm so grateful for all of her movies, interviews and even everyday appearance.  Real sunshine 😍
shes so gorg
Peaky Blinders ☠️
The wat his accent slightly gets thicker the moment she mentioned Peaky Blinders
The way he has to think before talking and he keeps pausing but Margot talks seamlessly.
I love these two❤ i want them in a movie or a series together now! They seem soo comfortable with each other after just meeting.
nice combo
no Margot, Barbie is not the masterpiece you think it is. and no one's waiting for the next lame Gerwig film.
Chilliana asıgım ya
Two brilliant brains in one show
"Luckily I was unemployed at the time" - Cillian Murphy
Margot is talented and beautiful
I wish they had spoken in their own slang ie. margot Australian & cillian Irish. It wld hv been a hoot
I love Cillian ❤
Barbie was GOD AWFUL
This is so good. Loved this interview so much.
The two most beautiful people on the planet, according to me
yeah
I love them both so much
Barbie sucks.
All I see is Peaky Blinders Vs Barbie.........................Unbalanced but still interesting with multiple outcomes for sure..............;)
Margot is just all of us
Amazing chat!!!! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼  I just love Margot and Cillian🖤🖤🖤 I love how Margot pronounces “BARBIE”🩷🩷🩷🩷🩷🩷  Cillian, so serious so  mysterious so classy😮‍💨😮‍💨
❤
Cillian Murphy’s comes across as the most unaffected, relaxed person in the world! 😮
I was gonna leave the cinema any moment while watching Barbie, but I tested my patience.
I like his wedding ring.
Trash Barbie
Cillian Murphy is so attractive
My all time favourite actress, so talented and sooo gorgeous with an incredible personality ❤
He gets it.❤
I can't take the Barbie movie seriously😂. But I will watch Cillian in ANYTHING.
so fkn cool
Cilian Murphy is a fine gentleman. I am not gay.
.........The woman Margot was talking about, the woman who doesn't have introspect sounds like me........ It's more like can't have it to me.....
Cilian ❤❤❤
My favourite actor since ever, Cillian Murphy.  Well, since I saw him in Red Eye.  Been my favourite since then.  Breakfast on Pluto and everything else since!  I like Margot too.
17:46  who is the baby-eater second from the left?  and who is definitively  not overcompensating in the "red"?  smh (chuckle)...
how sexist, "barbie's" chair is higher than cilian's???
I am a man and i loveedd both barbie and oppenheimer.. best year for cinema
Margot fangirling in the end is the best 😂😂😂
Just the calm way he says likewise
well, probably it's just me, but I felt Margot a bit too much here, but maybe because it is just so damn contrasted with Cillian. But I really appreciated a very intelligent, meaningful, humble and all-in-all nice and smooth interview between them
I feel like Cillian let her speak but Margot was interupting him...
Love him but I hear Mr Rogers every day. I'm not from Pittsburgh but I live here and i really hear the accent.
14:49 Both Margot and Cillian are smiling to each other 😊😂😊😂
Two of the highest grossing film of all time in the two highest grossing film of 2023 have 7 million views within a month of video release 😊😂😊😂😊
Imagine a Peaky Blinder movie, Directed by Nolan. ❤
talk about two behemoths in the industry. and their movies came out on the same day. This is like a surprise I didn’t know I needed 🎉
Love it :)
This was amazing 🔥
Obviously like anyone else I love movies and she and he seem genuinely nice/and good actors. But this whole behaving like the acting and directing celebs do is the second coming of christ is all a bit silly, it's just a movie and they are just people.
To say the hi Barbie and hi Ken over and over makes is ridiculous and somewhat comedic. I do understand this part is about decorum and polite society and some ways highlights its myths. I like this date about Oppenheimer confusion and it makes sense considering Directors have the deadlines and the actors play the role. I see both of these movies less as opposites than Cillian Murphy describes especially just when just referring to the storyline of Barbie because Barbie storyline is more about the idiosyncrasies of the world more than taking action with a clear agenda like in Oppenheimer. Winston Churchill in a boiler suit. I guess Barbie’s director has something in common with Winston.  I prepare for my work and yeah a year is a long time to prepare for anything. I’ve done acting work in my 20’s too. I guess making stories about the person who worked part of Oppenheimer will need some good storytelling. Barbie’s director did a good job and her note taking method is a good example. They don’t have parent Barbie’s. Warning on herbal smokes for Barbie’s I’m sure. The Calm app is great I definitely recommend.
Algorithms are pretty sophisticated Margot
She s stunning as usual❤
*LISTEN TO ME, NOW PUT THEM ON THE MOVIE TOGETHER IDC AS A WHAT JUST PUT THEM TOGETHER THEN IT WILL BE BOMB*
that was mean 😂😂🎉🎉🎉
Its amazing that you can have a glance about what movies are about without having to watch them , both movies came the same day I watched only Openheimer and I felt like the rushed it a bit and focused on the science stuff a lot which I found boring , but the movies is great over all , as for barbie eeeeeh was a bit controvesial and many people had opinions about it so I couldn't see it
So, Scarecrow and Harley Quinn walk into an interview room...
I would love to see another episode with Cillian Murphy paired with Bryan Cranston. I think those guys together are so interesting since they are the lead actors in the biggest series ever and have very interesting stories to tell and ask eachother.
What a duo 😍😍
Openhimer sguad.
His sleep story on the Calm app 😭 She is too real
I need more of this! Amazing
Great Convo, terrible editing
MARGO IS SO BEAUTIFUL 😭
Thanks for sharing the video and for the subs. ❤
left wanting more!
We all know only one of the 2 movies is good :)
Wonferful interview. Loved how Margot let the 'gushing' for the end. Admirable pair of artist and people.
This interview is so boring but he's so beautiful, I'm still gonna watch it 😢
Good lord what a beauty she is
23:45 like ''fast 10'' or whatever, summs so many things about that franchise actually 🙃
Petition to have an episode pairing Emma Watson and Emma Corrin ❤
This man MUST win an Oscar! He was freaking monumental!
Imagine these two made a baby.
Honestly if Mattel had not let the film be made w the original script which makes them look questionable, then they REALLY would have been questionable. So good on them lol
She was always interrupting him and talking about her movie over and over again.
This is so much more enjoyable than watching press junket interviews.
margot needs my children
https://youtube.com/@world_for_alles?si=MNPmCOcCNgYID0M8
Iconic. So happy this exists. Summer stars of ‘23 yay barbenheimer 😎
What a fascinating pairing… especially if you take the Barbenheimer out of it. These two almost couldn’t be more opposite in their outward personalities, levels of expressiveness, even what they say they value (besides work), but yet their obviously true love of film and “cinema” (as Cillian kept saying :) ), as well as their thoughtfulness, curiosity, intellect, and admiration for good work, just bonded them.  These Actors on Actors are amazing! I’ve always liked both of them, and it’s funny because they fascinate me for mostly different reasons. But one commonality they certainly share is their humility, passion, interest, and they’re both good listeners.   I love how Margot fangirled in such a great way, and I love how Cillian started coming out of his shell and you can see him forget this is a filmed conversation for a bit. :)
I love how she fangirls about Peaky fuckin blinders.
Would have been better if cillian did more talking she did most of the talking
The Barbie pr team is at it again 😅
La Guasona y el Espantapájaros 😮..
Hear me out : Thomas Shelby movie by Guy Ritchie
Brilliant
So many interesting things about this video. The fact that Cillian agreed/wanted a 45 minute interview with literally anyone at all. 2. He seemed to be genuinely enjoying it. 3. The juxtaposition of his introversion and age/wisdom against her youthful, vivacious and yet thoughtful demeanor. 4. You would think she would be intimidated to interview him and he bored out of his mind to listen to her but no.
Such interviews educate the viewers at so many levels. The sincerity and calmness in telling the stories  by them give insights into life.
barbie...from what I can tell is nothing but Hollywood Woke virtue signaling shite. As expected out of a child's doll. Oppenheimer was excellent, as expected. I would not put either in the same sphere other than the Hollywood machine pumping millions into making each movie. Thats the thing.... movies are too overdeveloped. We need movies more about content, other than visuals... Not that visuals aren't fun, it's now overblown these days.
Cillian Murphy finally getting attention that he deserves. I’ve loved this guy for YEARS!! I love it
She is so boring. He can't even hide it. You can see that she depends on her looks. Nobody challenged her to be more interisting.
Meu Deus que FOFOS e que química. Preciso de um filme com os dois.
Am I the only one or 'Actors on Actors' does sound wrong😅
Noone was itching for a Greta film, but ok. Christopher Nolan on the other hand - yes!
Margot Robbie  and Cillian Murphy are great actors and will go down as the most brilliant actors in the history of great actors. Their love for cinemas and respect for each other can be seen in this video.
the noise gate in the microphone makes them sound with absolute no emotion, it seems they not even breathing... lol
bahbi baHbi, IT'S BARBIE
can someone please tell me if at the end they mention any kind of spoiler about the last season of Peaky Blinders?
Sensational, without trying to be. Two Real Royal Deal Artists, who centered THE portmanteau of 2023. Thank you, Variety.
What a great interview! Amazing putting these young great actors and people together to talk about life and their career.
Love this guy.. start loving him when I first saw 28 days
Two wonderful actors. Great interview. Margot has come a long way from Ramsay St and thoroughly deserved.
Cillian Murphy looks like the kids on the old Barbie movies
So great 🎉🙌
Irish mobs where hawked by cow boys..
i dont care interview. just want to see tommy fucking shelby
I just realized, that Cillian has a very beautiful voice. Reminds of Alan Rickman‘s voice a bit
Im only here to hear about the Peaky Blinders.
Two intelligent people having a refreshingly in-depth and earnest conversation about their work and their processes. A real joy to watch, and  fangirl Margot is right: Tommy Shelby is probably THE icon of tens.
Barbie was more political than Oppenheimer. Republicans are bad .
I genuinely can’t begin to explain how much I love these two people
How did Robbie get 50 millions $ for Barbie and Cillian only got 10 millions $ for his  incredible movie….Oppenheimer ….so not fair 😔 Love Cillian and Nolan the director , both were so great🕊🧡
Someone knows which's the name of the podcast she used as a reference for the character?
Something tells me that Margot is producing a film that she pitched to Cillian once they walked off set
Please do all three of those directors’ filmography! I will BE there the moment they drop
Next movie together: Barbinheimer.
This man is so beautiful and amazing ❤
Poor Cillian having to be chosen to discuss the terrible film that was Barbie simply because his movie came out the same time. Whoever paired them must have a child's brain.
new ship
Cillian carried the conversation.
Can we all take a moment for the fact that, Christopher Nolan does not own a phone.👏
This conversation sounds like 2 people just grabbing a cup of coffee. Its so natural and i love it!
Big fan of Cillian Murphy ❤❤❤
Awesome!! Love both of you!!! Keep rocking being Australian Margot, we're so proud!! and Cillian you are a brilliant actor and I absolutely loved Peaky Blinders and was so sad hearing of Polly' s passing on screen and off, the gorgeous Helem Mccrory. Margot and Cillian keep making great movies!!!!!!!
💣 vs 🌹
Cillian would be an awesome amazing Ken
The scarecrow and Harley Quinn
ENCANTADOR
okay goddess
Vi Barbie por mi novia y Oppenheimer por mi
Robbie not a good actor and Murphy is so so good
Barbie was total trash
She has a beautiful face..😊
Margot, Harley, Barbie ❤
we need a movie with these two, I felt they had a lot of chemistry!
I can’t wait for the 25th anniversary Barbenheimer conversation these two will have.
I've been smiling through the whole video. Such nice people❤
Everyone sees Barbie and Oppenheimer. I see two Arkham doctors.
Both movies We're terrible tho... I dont understand Americans
@13:14 Modesty on working with Nolan.
Barbie was a great movie.
WE'LL HAVE HER PLAYING IN OUR BAND ...........;P

Let Cillian speak...
what intelligent charming people
Margot Robbie and Cillian Murphy gave me the best experience in the cinema, they are both my favorite actors ❤😎
Ireland teeth vs Australian teeth: they both bite good!
Se me cumplió,ahora falta que hagan una película juntos
Next minute Margot's production company will be chasing to produce a Peaky Blinders movie 😂 🥰
The line by Margot Robbie "Hopefully not the last time", at the end truly defined how much she admires Cillian as an Actor
Fantastic conversion to listen to. Thank you for the wonderful films and insight into their creation
45:04 hi
this was so amazing!! ❤
Barbenheimer is the best 🚀
Somehow this looks like a perfect first date
15:49
Title renamed: Cheekbones on Cheekbones...
These two movies such a legend.
I LOVE THIS COUPLE.... CILLIAN MURPHY AND MARGOT ROBBIE !!! ❤❤😍😍👌🏼👌🏼💕💕🙋🏻‍♀️🙋🏻‍♀️🙋🏻‍♀️🙋🏻‍♀️🙋🏻‍♀️
Cillian is humble and unassuming. Margot is pushy and overbearing. Found it painful to watch sadly. Cillian and Emily Blunt would have matched better. Both humble and grateful for their opportunities.  Margot looks like she’d climb over her own grandma to get ahead.
"and tell me" under the radar Irish colloquialism. tell me this and tell me no more. such a gent
I'm gonna show my child margots movie n if daughter then cillian's movie so to make them straight 😂😂😂
BARBENHEIMER???!?!?
he sounds like Carl Sagan
This video is good. It would be so much better if Margot would shut up for like 2 minutes.
After watching this entire interview I have but one thing to say……               “Yeah”
After watching this entire interview I have but one thing to say……               “Yeah”
she is so beautiful oh my god
Barbie should never be written by Greta, that is is exactly why it couldn’t be better. Half of the people who went to watch barbie wanted to see what the heck her messages were in the movie. She has ruined the brand in long term . Not something Mattel should be proud of.
It's so weird to see him not as Tommy Shelby
Top comments are always typical and unoriginal n everyone likes it. Sad state of affairs
Him in black and her in pink… the stylists knew what they were doing for an interview like this🤌🏻
Margot is a producer so maybe she can produce the Peaky Blinders movie.
OMG Cillian, soooo Handsome I love you. 😍😍😍😍😍
Cilian deserves an Oscar for this role. Didn't like the movie really but he was incredible.
Margot is ethereal beauty ❤
We need them in a movie fr
It's the fact that in  23:42 she spoiled F10 and no one noticed...

Круті актори, без сумніву легендарні фільми
I want to see Peaky Blinders movie with these two amazing performers as lead characters (Let Thomas kill The Führer in his bunker with the help of spy/cia Margot) 🫣
Margot barbie
What a great, interesting and stimulating paring. Robbie has a wonderful mentality and I think she will go onto become a writer directer as she has a great feel for so much of cinema.
I am happy that finally Cillian Murphy is getting the spotlight he always deserved
Круто! ❤
Barbie and Oppenheimer, both worked with Rachel McAdams on About Time & Red Eye respectively. Margot & Cillian is the ultimate dynamic duo of our dreams❤!!
Why did not they changed the colors for this interview 😢❤
43:15 yup thats when she asks him about the thomas fucking shelby
Cillian seems like he does not care😂
Margot Robbie and Dave Grohl are two of one kind. AMAZING people, HUGE TALENT, and like us, FANS OF GOOD THINGS IN LIFE. HAHAHAHA
Feels a bit like Margot is going to write a handwritten letter to Nolan, soon ;) Cilian will be there anyway
their babies would have KILLER EYES
people who came to watch the peaky blinders part!!! 43:10  here it is
You can tell these two are such committed artists. Their celebrity is just a byproduct.
Honestly i don’t even care if they were just reading the phone books I’d still watch for an entire hour to hear their accents. lol.  I love that they sound so interested and actually explain the process of getting the movie made. Brilliant pairing.  Killian & Margot prove they are brilliant actors & talented interviewers.
Italiano god
Holy moly a month in and it’s at 6.5 million views! Just such an amazing phenomenon. As a very long time cillian Murphy fan, it’s hard to get my head around how much press and talking he’s been doing. Also these two have completely different energy , like she’s that really fast chatty thing going on and he is chilling and taking his time. Can’t believe how this whole thing turned out! Unreal like j can see it with Barbie but a biopic about the father of the atomic bomb that’s almost completely talking and board room meetings, it’s beyond impressive!
RIP
I think I’m in love….     With Tommy fookin Shelby
The way he was so focused by listening and keeping that straight eye contact. For some reason, looks like Margot was a bit intimated in the beginning, but in a good way lol. After he started talking, that's when she started to warm up and the shyness went away lol.
Their combination is so great as an interview
dude was like: tf am I doing here
Margot cuts him off a lot lol
petition for Margot to be in a Nolan movie
I would love to see Cillian Murphy & Margot Robbie working a film together, directed by Christopher Nolan, they look have a chemistry.
You're welcome for the coffee margot, you certainly did not just come to the idea yourself.
Why would Mattel worry; the spin-offs in Barbie products probably exploded. The message was lost on young girls who just went after the Barbie products and wearing pink more. How does that do anything for women?? Generations of women have longed for Barbie dolls and that was why they all flocked to the show and it became a must see event. Young girls did not get the sarcasm or subtle subtext.
I love cinema. 2023 was particularly rich in terms of films of various genres. Thanks to this, I have the impression that a lot of people have rediscovered the pleasure of going to see a film at the cinema, of spending several hours in a cinema with strangers but feeling the same emotions without always having the same opinions. Cinema is such a vast and interesting art, and each actor/actress is so unique in the way they interpret a character !  I love Cillian Murphy and most of the films he stars in. He's always very authentic and doesn't try to blow everyone away, just create. He has a range of characters that are all so different from each other (Peaky Blinders is nothing like Breakfast On Pluto, for example), yet he's always invested and talented in his roles. Speaking of Margot Robbie, I knew her before Barbie (I discovered her in Once Upon A Time In Hollywood) but I think this film suits her so well. She's really talented and seems like such a kind and caring person !  I think it's a great idea to have them meet because you can tell they have a lot of respect for each other's work.
Agora quero um filme dos dois juntos
Murphy barely spoke...48 minutes wasted
Both fantastic actors
43:17 the story of peaky blinders
Cillian is just...incredible.
What A pair ❤
barbie was shit and oppenheimer was documentaries.Margot was old for barbie.And is so greedy and fake as a person
What a hot combo RRarr
Porque Margot escogío esa fecha? Pregunta sería
Poxa, so ela fala. Que saco
Tommy Shelby is struggling to act like Cillian Murphy
When do they talk about peaky blinders
I want them to be besties.
Top tier white man top tier white woman pairing lmao
19:59
cillian murphy i love you ❤
Gemssss
She is insanely gorgeous, lawd.
I wonder if a script - original,  mind you - could be created to star these two together?
Good pairing but Margot just can't stop interrupting Cillian.  She's asks a question and is impatient and while Cillian is constructing his answer she butts in and cuts him off.  Very annoying.
14:43 they're hhhhhhhhhhuge
Can anyone please tell me when they will talk abou tommy fuckin shelby
it is madness, how he's able to act like Oppie in the film. completely different from how he's acting here. totally different – *everything* is different. and not just speech or mannerisms, in physical presence. Oppie, if you watch careful, is virtually never loose in that film. even when he's sitting stark naked in an easy chair talking to Jean (who's also naked, but _lounging,_ like a Rennaisance painting), he's upright and proper. stiff, you may say. but Cillian here is _extremely_ loose.   it's a truly transformative performance in all the best ways. like Heath Ledger in _Dark Knight,_ he's just not Cillian. he's Oppie. and he's gold. golden. Golden Globe. Oscar next. it's a sure-shot. has to be.   if anyone's still interested in the Oscars or betting pools, it's RDJ for Best Supporting, Cillian for Best Actor, Chris Nolan Best Director, _Oppenheimer_ Best Picture. my dark horse pick is Hans Zimmer for Best Original Score. that's my big hope. maybe his most effective work since _The Lion King_ or, failing that, at least _Inception._
43:13
The continuous wearing of pink to everything is something.
obviamente en la cultura light en q vivimos.... hubo más gente en Barbie.
do Ken and Barbie or Barbie and Ken as a sequel title
I love Cilian for asking about the woman who has no inner voice "Is she happi-er"?
they're everything
the title is also very appropriate for a porn film. one where "actors on actors", that expensive porn.
THESE TWO ICONS HAVE ME ON CHOKEHOLD!!!!
Did Murphy  have a stammer in his younger days?  Never noticed it when hes asking but in interviews  he talks exactly  like  someone who  has learned to talk around it. Its come out more when he's  sat opposite Margot... id be the same.
Like them both
So... The Irish & the Aussie 😅❤🎉
Beautiful <3
They really didnitn
Someone give this man a fun set with dance parties and movie nights, he deserves it. Greta, i'm looking at you.
That was genuinely so lovely.
47:28 clam sleep story lol
02:15 02:25 02:34 02:55 03:00 03:44 04:00
Yeah that's was incredible competition between movies ✨✅
Crazy how the other day I see Peaky Blinders is coming to a film and she asked this. This was the push I needed to actually watch the show. It’s been sitting in my List for months
Que buena entrevista mutua.
Watching right-wingers piss their pants in anger over a film based on a children's doll was as hilarious as it was tragic.
Just here for My Guy Thomas Shelby 😂
Weird... both of them "lost" their accents for this. Damn shame really.
Amen abbba padre
Hi barbie!
Киллиан просто супер. Ителлигентный, образованный, хорошо воспитанный. Получила большое удовольствие от интервью. Спасибо❤
44:25 Margot is so sweet 🥺  But Cillian is also really lovely 😄
(Barbie-2) as Barbie asked for a vagina at the end of the movie...maybe Ken asks for a nob and just about every favourite toy character also wants out so Santa and Barbie have to team up to save the day.
Cillian trying to look interested, and Margot trying not to show her disgust for Oppenheimer, lol
Does she talk about anything other than herself? I'm 10 minutes in and she cuts him off every time he opens his mouth and she's just "me me me" the entire damn time.
When you hear the name cilian murphy, you think its a girl
Somene knows where to find the spanish version ))?
Be honest, for the first minute or so were were just trying to get our heads around "wait she's Australian?! Wait he's Irish?!"  Like even if you knew on paper, hearing it hits different
Cillian is so gracious and polite to let Margot just speak without interruption. Love him❤
❤Margot ❤
Deberian besarse para romper la tensión
Oh Margot! Quanto sei Bella!!!👌🏻…
Funny, both Margot and Cillian are that almost maybe 1% of people that are naturally attractive because they are striking.   Most of us resign ourselves to dressing and making up for appearances, but these two people are people you want to talk to sometimes more the LESS makeup they have on.
I didn’t watch Oppenheimer, I don’t want to watch something depressing.  I also didn’t go to the theater to watch Barbie, I waited until it came out on Amazon.  My 7 y/o daughter stops older ladies now and tells them they are beautiful.
Hopefully not for last time means in Ireland?
cool
Golden globes❤
Have a shorthand with someone Not in my wheelhouse Inure Hokey So much in one interview. Cillian is a wordsmith!
She is so beautiful ❤
The picture of Ryan and Margo on Venice Beach looks clearly photo shopped. Cut and pasted. Interesting.
YouTube "Why don't you watch this 50 minute video of 2 people talking?" Me "Eh. I'll take a quick look" 50 minutes later...
Admirable how calmly confident they are. A great representation for a new generation of actors / actresses. Throughly enjoyed watching them discuss without the need to interrupt.
Paired by eyes color
Can she keep her mouth shut for once? Every time Cillian is talking, she's talking through it... so annoying!
Pairing limited talented Margot Robbie with extremely talented Cilian Murphy, is like pairing Catherine Zeta Jones with Jeremy Irons. 🥴
This woman is going to wear pink every day until the Oscars are over and I'm here for it.
I was today years old when I found out that Cillian is married
Their both so gorgeous
"Hopefully not for the last time" 👀
Okey I think Bobbie is superficial and not true in this interview
They don't need to make a sequel to Barbie, or even make a Peaky Blinders film. What they should do is make two original films, each starring Margot in one and Cillian in the other, but they exist within the same universe (maybe as husband/wife, or best friends, or enemies?) and release them on the same day so people can watch them on the same day.
Cillian = class   Margot = clown
Did he call her Margaret at the end? So adorable. Both intelligent conversationalists. So good.
PRODUCERS ND DIRECTORS OF THE WORLD  PLEASE CASTE THEM TOGETHER
43:11 peaky blinders talk 🦜❤
Now I am become death... in a barbie world
I love Margot so much but she kept interrupting a few times and ugh I wanted to hear his full thoughts
Yesss the sleep story on the “Calm” app has knocked me out 😂 that’s so funny she mentioned that. He was the best voice ever
is it me or there are something in the air between both of them? More him towards her, and her beeing like conscious about that and playing also slightfully
They should make a movie named Barbenhemier 😂
С большим удовольствием посмотрела эту беседу. Про Килиана мало полноценной информации, много повторов. В этой передаче, я могу сама сделать вывод о человеке, это здорово! Спасибо авторам)))  Они разные, но вполне уравновешивают друг друга, рада, что ютьюб выдал мне такой рандом
meu deus eu amo esse video
in 2024 can we please abandon this goofy transvestite stuff like its so 2020... old news
Margot fangirling over peaky blinders and trying to convince him to do a spinoff😂❤
Bull spit she needs to work under me 10 years ago .😊😊 would have loved being insainely jelious
They're very cool together 🥰😍😘
Margot is ADORABLE when she turns into a Peaky Blinders fangirl.
Peaky fookin' blinders, right
Does she still sound australian?
If you're interested to find out more about the personality and the life of a person like that woman with the PHd, i recommend this novel written by "albert Camus" called "l'étranger " or "the foreigner" its an amazing story and really shows in depth how a person like that can be.
Actors on actors? Who's gonna end up on who?
Her smile is perfect! 🤩
it's a scarecrow and Harley quinn meet.
43:16 margot and cilian talking about peaky blinders
Barbie was a dumb movie
I cant believe they didnt talk about Batman's lore, considering they were both Batman villains (even played the character more than once).
Are they flirting the whole time or am I exaggerating 😂
Hmnn Margot kept cutting Murphy off, woulda been nice to hear him talk a bit more.
Incredible how Cillian stay focused during talk with one and only Margot, class
The term meme was originated with Richard Dawkins, for those unware.
Both of them are so attractive🔥
Nada que ver con lo que hablan, pero no he podido evitar fijarme en LO BLANQUISIMOS QUE TIENE LOS DIENTES MARGOT ROBBIE QUEEEEEEEE
I love that she mentioned the sleep story he does!!
yeah
margot fangirling over cillian is so me
CILLIAN MURPHY!!!!!!!! i love you!!!!!!
What darling human beings they both are! Adored the two movies, adore them both in anything. 💖💖
"Actors on Actors" 😭😭 this would be so much different if it wasn't YouTube
Thank you Morgot for pitching a Peaky Blinders movie at the end!
22:19 My catchphrase, “It’s go Time!”
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This was the most iconic summer movie era I got to experience! I hope more epic releases like this happen again
❤Margot ❤
What we need next is an interview with Greta Gerwig and Christopher Nolan
Thank you Variety for this amazing interview!
I wonder if the Barbie movie would've been different if Margot Robbie latched onto the "source material" of the 2000s animated Barbie movies...? Although they are all often framed as "Barbie in..." The Nutcracker, or Swan Lake, etc. as the actor rather than Barbie the character. There were fake bloopers, though, on some DVDs!
i hope ai will destroy the arthouse bullshit and we will all become robots.
Margot was reserved for the whole interview and by the end of the video she could wait any longer to show her fan girl of Tommy Shelby side😊😂
Maybe that’s why Americans are so bad at doing accents.
Margot: ‘Mattel have never made a movie before’  All 44 animated Barbie movies: 👁️👄👁️   (I love her but I will always be disappointed that the Barbie movie had almost 0 references to the huge catalog of Barbie films that made me and I’m sure many other people fans of barbie as a kid)
Greatest movie summer ever.
Algorithm sent me to the movies to watch Oppenheimer and Barbie the same day. Strange, because i hadn't been to a movie showing in years before then.
This was such a good interview!
2 superstars speaking like human beings. How refreshing top class
CM is such a gentleman.  Listening intently to MR's opinions and acknowledging her talents and input to her own Project, I clearly didn't get Barbie's message at all.  His Opennheimer performance was excellent and understated.  I enjoyed this film and its personal attention to detail and insight into the man beyond the Myth.  I could listen to CM all day, his voice is wonderful, like a Harp.  Goldie still has her own voice also very sweet and engaging.  💝  CASTING NOW!  CM for a new Robocop.  Call Verhoeven immediately!  MR could also star as anyone she wishes.  CM please apply for James Bond, even if it is a one off.  Margot as the Femme Fatale.  I'd go see that!  Loving the Barbie power suit, 2 cute.  Lovely convorsensation between to absolute professionals.  🥳
My guy Cillian can't escape. By order of the peaky blinders lmao
*I love YouTube too*
they really took the meme to the next level lol
This should've been called "Cheekbones and Jawlines."
wow, the best woman in the world kinda boring.. ty for the interview
Its embarrassing that films like Barbie even have an audience. But thats just my opinion. The girls of today are certainly very interested. But that alone does not explain this success. It will allways remain a secret to me.
7:18 Margot: "i mean it's a good date, we picked that day too!" Cillian: "yeah I know!" adorable
Thank you, Variety, for this series! And the one for TV Shows! There aren't enough interviews with actors actually about their acting and their projects. I don't care about their personal dramas because that's not the reason I watched what they did. It would be really awesome to do the same with singers! Maybe it could be a discussion about an album or an event or else. It would be really fun to listen to them talking about their projects.
Cillian it's not using his british accent ??
Great conversation ❤
Love how Cillian’s gold standard for the length of a tv show is 6 seasons and a movie
he's so beautiful
I always thought Cillian had to be Kevin Sorbos son
If she had been in Peaky Blinders, I would have finished the series.
I preferred top gun
I dont have a 1 hour but i can leave this vid3o with thumb up. Happy new year! 🎉
Zelensky i think golden palm in cannes for his role 😂😂😂...
"Hopefully not the last time"  Well, someone's gotta bring them back together during the Oscars.
Feminist V/s Sigma
I love that a person who worked on a movie about the effing nuclear bomb, and a person who worked on a movie about a plastic doll, just treat each other as colleages and equals. Just employees talking about work.
Cillian Murphy 🥵🥵
Mr. Murphy - I have become death, the destroyer of worlds. "WHY, OPPENHEIMER?" - Because I created the atomic bomb. Margot - I have become the oppression, the fascism, the face of oppressive capitalism and sexism in this world! "WHY, BARBIE?" - Because I'm skinny, tall, beautiful and blonde! 😂😂 I'm a big fan of 😘Mr. Murphy, and Margot is beautiful, beautiful, and beautiful
Cillian could play an incredible trans character.
I still don’t understand how people think Peaky Blinders was a finished product after its last episode. Like his many enemy is still out there shaking hands with Hitler. Would love to see Tomas Shelby take that prick down.
Margot when you ask Gillian questions let’s hear cillian ok ?
I also like his sleep story on the calm app! We need a Margot barbie themed one haha
we had a barbie vs oppenheimer debate in my college 😂😂
Margot is the type of lady that I would have no issue starting a conversation with. She's so far out of my league that I wouldn't be nervous. But then when she starts talking about anything, that's when I would breakdown and forget how to talk.
How did i just find out about this?! This is absolute perfection!!!
Variety, you did good on this one.
This is the best thing I watched on internet today. Cheers. ❤
What a conversation, all about the work. Love to see it! 🎬🤙🏽✅🙏🏽
They're really the outgoing and introvert friend duo i love the energy 😂
The conversation between an extrovert and an introvert guy😂
Imagine both of them in a movie.
she's perfect
I get the impression that the set of Barbie sounds like Cillian's idea of hell but he's being too nice to admit it.
One day a biopic might be made of this and the actor is gonna take notes on how Mr. Murphy tends to touch his chin
Whenever Greta and Margot are planning on doing a Barbie sequel, I think Cillian would make a great role as Kenneth, who’s a human and Sasha’s teacher. He meet Margot’s Barbie and they hit it off
Oh yes
26:35  I’d love to see that science.
Goshhhh I can’t take my eyes off her
July 21st was a good day. Cuz it's my birthday
Margot bringing up Peaky Blinders made me so happy
no talks of peaky?
let take a moment to appreciate how gorgeous margot robbie is. bro is THE barbie
Nice chat. Margot has a bad habit of finishing Cillian's thoughts. That got old in a hurry.
I would love to see these two actors together in a movie as the two main leads!
She's so good. Took the role of the interviewer. Got more out of him than I've ever seen. AoA is interesting work.
I agree, July 21 is a great date! My bday hehehehe
15:02 Talking talking :)
why didnt they talk much about oppenheimer and much more about barbie and cillian and the compition, it doesnt seem like margot saw oppenheimer AT ALL
Wow! gee golly gosh! last nite was awesome. In a complex multi dimensional actress production I started off as your mental patient with the literal translation of Margot Robbie being Maa (Thai for Dog or Horse depending on tone) GOT Robbie (My name) we then moved on from The female horse that got her dog, avoiding breeding donkeys in favour of Kendom with Wyld Stallyons whereby at the end I became your gynaecologist - and you wore pink inside out and through out - thank you for a wonderful night in, Mwwwaaa to Maa
At 44:20 Margot fangirling for Cilian to make Peaky Blinders movie is all of us..we all want to continue watching Thomas fooking Shelby
WE LOVE BOTH OF THEM!
Whoever came up w this idea. u a real one ily bro
I’m praying someone decides to offer Cillian Murphy a cameo in the sequel
va a fa al mecanic!!! i love u
I don’t believe for a second it was just some coincidence that they were competing on the same weekend
Do u think he watched Barbie
It's crazy how even their personalities are so opposite. Their representation to each movie is fascinating
Cillian defending himself not knowing what a meme is is a modern day Oppenheimer
I can’t imagine cillian sitting thru the barbie movie. Definitely putting his acting to work on this one
barbenheimer is the equivalent of when doom eternal and acnh released on the same day a few years back
Great interview!👌
9:05 barbenheimer discussion starts, you're welcome
one ten minute conversation with cillian and he could solve all of my problems
movies r great, this video>>>boooooorrrriiinnngggggggg
Such a sh1tty movie
unfortunately, she interrupted Cillian a lot
If Margot did Playboy she'd be the best to ever do it.
We finally have the dynamic between Scarecrow and Harley Quinn.
Some people should be forced to have children. Like these two and make a supermodel baby. Also Lebron James and Brittany Griner. Also Trump and Steven Segal
Fucking compression
Not only are they both stunningly good looking but they are both also very talented actors.
What did she say at 46:30?
Oppenheimer went on too long. The commission scenes were too much.
This can never happen in indian cinema😢
this is sooo good
100% straight Hollywood brought to you by booze.
Shit, Cillian really looks like a gangster
On Wednesdays we wear pink?  Margot, some of us guys have this thing called "Salmon Thursday". We may not wear pink on Wednesday but we will wear it at least one day a week.
Murphy in these clothes gave me Thomas Shelby vibes
I wouldn’t be surprised if they were asked to announce a winner at the Oscars together
That was a wonderful conversation and these two had never met before! They are such interesting people and it looked like they almost forgot about the cameras, and just had a great  time. As did we...

this is the most perfect interview 2023 could’ve given us
Bisexuals be eating with this video 🥵🥵🥵
I'd love to see Cillian team up again with Danny Boyle. Sunshine and 28 Days Later put him on the map with their leading roles. He deserves the praise he gets.

43:13 The "Peaky blinders" part
please make a movie together, The vibe of this episode was so incredible. Thanks Cillian and Margot.
Scarecrow and Harley Quinn in a room together?  Yay!
You know it I know it... bro  was so chill she was so please f me, if that's scripted bravo
oh behave darlin
This is the best thing ever
Cillian Murphy and Christopher Nolan's combined IQ is probably around 300. Margot Robbie and Greta Gerwig's IQs combined might almost be triple digit.
Epic moment...
This is just 48 minutes of a bubbly Margot Robbie talking, with a shy Cillian Murphy politely saying "yeah, yeah".
I just love Margot Robbie, but relate far more to Cillian as an introvert. It was riveting to observe these two sort of interview each other.
I hope cillian has more interviews !
che el meme se volvio realidad
sigma best 😮😮😮
Welp... that was the quickest 48 minutes
This was just GREAT. Loved them both before and now even more 👍🏻👍🏻
How I love your way when you speak.
thomas getting old fkn hell
❣💔
you just think you are alive. #account #gmail #number #password
ABSOLUTE CINEMA
👏👏👏
Amazing! What a year it has been. I only wish Margot let Cillian talk a bit more :D
they're insane for this
What a beatiful, beautiful souls. They would be great pair, I have no doubt bout it. Cillian is magically calm.
Sooo... I saw a clip of this on Insta and somewhere in this Margot Robbie said that a producer on Oppenheimer asked to move Barbie's release date. Robbie got back at him saying if he's scared, Oppenheimer should move. Neither of them did. Cillian Murphy called it "good instinct" on her part.  Here's the thing, Oppenheimer got the date first. WB set Barbie on the same day specifically to spite Nolan after he felt betrayed over their streaming decision with HBOMax. Oppenheimer is a 3 hour, R rated historical biopic. Of course the producer was scared — Barbie is a 2 hours IP-based fantasy comedy in PG13. It *would've* crush Oppenheimer.  As previously said, neither of them moved. It was Pink vs Black. But... there was an appeal to this. The people found it amusing enough and the phenomenon grew. It no longer became a "versus", it was a pair. It was a "date". We decided that Pink and Black go well together.  Admittedly, this is a very minor thing. It just personally irked me that we're supposed to credit Robbie for "Barbenheimer" when it was us who made it. Without us, it's a just feud with between a studio and a director.
The subtle crush feeling is so nice and relieving compared to all the bs. floating around internet.

if this is my house, then get the fuck out my HOUSE.
I'm gonna try to make her fall in love for me😜
Ummm someone get these two in a movie stat!!!
Cast them in a movie together, needs to be done
i just remember walking into regal and seeing how absolutely packed the giant parking lot was and thinking "oh my god cinema is so back" and it almost made me cry.
Love them both. Margot is beautiful, smart and full of personality. Cillian is warm, engaging, generous…both so talented. Would love to see them collaborate on a great movie together.
Please more of this kind of interview
Barbie is a good movie - the "alSo sprach Zarathustra" to me is an insult to Kubrick's magnum opus 2001 Space Oddyssey and don;' understand why the Barbie universe created. The rest? Barbie Movie was a fun movie with relevant social issues
First movie of Greta I looked up the director of and realised she was it, was about this woman just living life in New York, going through everyday ups and downs. She was the main actress and director, it was very touching, I kept expecting a twist, but there was no twist. It was just very everyday kind of thing.
This is not Cillian Murphy and Margot Robbie.       This is Scarecrow and Harley Quinn.
Pink originally was a man's colour....Actually, there is a men's store, essentially a men's shirt store called "Pink" on Madison Avenue called "PINK". Pink is sort of like high-heeled shoes were originally worn, developed for men.

DKR was 2012, and suicide squad was 2016, they JUUUUUST missed each other  harley and scarecrow wouldv'e been a trip . . . . BY ORDAHH OF THA PEAKY BLINDAHHZZZ!!!
I like that Margo Robbie goes down the youtube rabbit hole just like everyone else.
It would be a lot more succinct if "Actors on Actors" videos were just shots of the actors literally kissing each other's asses. It makes the same point in 10 seconds that this video takes almost an hour to do.
If y’all aren’t noticing how Margot is RUNNING CILLIAN in this interview as she negs him over him claiming to never be on social media…she busted that boy and did it in the only way Barbie could. Margot dominated this interview and I am so proud! “So you must not have seen any of the Barbenheimer memes since you don’t know what a meme is and because you’re not on social media, right?” THAT’S QUEEN SHIT.
They need to find a great role for Cillian in Barbie 2 so we can finally see these two together on the big screen at the same time.
Two of the worst performers I have ever seen together…Aproppiate 🤣
Besides the obviously amazing chemistry between this two very amazing people and their conversation just being so insteresting and pleasant, I give kuddos to the sound mixing who basically made ASMR out of this conversation
“Is she happy” Cillian 😂😂
I just want to know who wrote the Barbie script.
after watching this I want Cillian to be the lead in a Greta Gerwig movie.
Margot is super cute!!
i ship them
It warms my heart that Cillian knows who Mr. Rogers is.
So much to learn about how they prep for their roles. They put so much into it for a 3-hour movie for the audience. Massive credit to everyone for making this video. One day for sure🧿
I would love a rom com with them!
Itall all a lie
Excellent

These 2 make today's films enjoyable .

who knew I was taller than Murphy?
47 and 33
The both of them don't realise that they're talking to one of the hottest people in the world
omg this was so brilliant, love their so opposed personalities !
this is brilliant
They should be in a movie together
barbenheimer is talking to each other.....
barbie is rubish openheimer is best i don't understand how people watch barbie
Ai que fofos 🥹
They are definetely going to make a movie together one day
Nice!
In my PERSONAL OPINION I think if you swapped margot's gender it would look like Cillian in my OPINION.
Margot was jumping from one topic after another 😂  I don´t think she really registered most of the things Cillian said during the last part of the conversation. CM seemed a lot more listening and patient than she was.
barbie christmas special? dont need to make another movie to be the character
6:49, 8:20
9:20
Wonder why they paired them 😂
He totally creeped me out in”Red Eye” well played!
The fact that Chris Nolan doesn't have a phone is amazing. And that he wears a suit reminds me of Alfred Hitchcock👍🏻
Does anyone know the time stamp when Cillian sits like he's standing??  The part they memed 😂
Богемскую рапсодию не смотрел и не видел
cilian talking about barbie like its a serious film piece doesnt make any sense, especially after oppenheimer.....but the FORMAT is definitely one of the best since who better to ask non generic questions than someone who is in the same industry (another format thats great is Hot Ones where they ask guests questions while they are eating hot wings so its a very formal and animated experience)
48 minutes listening to them just talking about their work was so good.
me van a funal pero esta chica es la viva imagen de lo que es una mujer "no deja hablar al hombre siempre tiene que estarlo interrumpiendo no lo deja terminar ningua de sus comentarios que el quiere expresar."
Amooooo❤❤❤
Actor asks actor how they became so great. Barf. Get a real job. Do something meaningful with your life. Help humanity endure the suffering of life. This movie and gimp gosling who is running around and singing songs, the tough guy from drive, should go back to momma.
Sincerely, Barbie was not the super revolutionary social phenomenon they are assuming it was...
Personally I don't like Barbie and I think it's just a funny movie but nowhere near the insane quality of Oppenheimer but it was magical to have both films in the summer. Love to see these two superb actors together
Great interview! Truly the summer of cinema and pop culture!
Barbara Ruth Barbie Margot Robbie they sucker punched you and than expected extra from you. Will you choose to wake up now. Truth is yours now. Holy Spirit is no joke trust that truth. No more reboots moving forward. In Jesus Christs name we pray amen.
they are insane
Its exactly what I didn’t know I needed
Cillian Murphy is just wow
Margot Robbie is so beautiful, I can't even put it into words that such a person exists.
Oppenheimer is coming back on 70mm, I repeat, Oppenheimer is coming back on 70mm!!! January 12th-18th.
Barbie vs Oppenheinmer
Why she’s the only one talking and answering and not much from cillian is like he is the interviewer
I lol'd when Margot was talking about all the dancing on set and Cillian says "Awww" in a way that conveys it would be his personal hell but also he is genuinely happy they had a good time.
Cillian is a legend♥✨
me n who
yeah. ok. yeah))
i love them
"reasonably successful film" this is gunna be good
oh cillian  so amazing
she is so annoying the way she interupts!
Please let them make a puppy interview
Jolin…. Ella no para de hablar. No se da cuenta de que no le dedica apenas tiempo a él?
https://youtu.be/AJDes6YGiTc?si=0Anj7lmHcwRdOV37
Cillian murphy: "yeah" Me:❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Guys she is so mid! Why is she even famous?? This is so stupid
the barbenheimer summer was probably one of the best things that have happened ever in the history of the humanity.
It would be pretty cool if they starring a movie like Mr & Mrs. Smith. They are a good couple
no one: cillian murphy: yeah
I honestly never paid a ton of attention of Cillian Murphy over the years until PB and Oppenheimer. I just kinda knew he was there, but then I saw Oppenheimer and was blown away and started watching more of his content. He really is amazing. Then there's Margot... enough said <3
Cillian- yeah****yeah**pause**yeah man jst love him,,such a character
I can't focus on what they're saying I'm just obsessed with that bubblegum pink and white polka dots blazer💓💖💝
I'm too jaded to comment about this .
Wait, Mattel has not made a movie before? So who created all the Barbie movies I watched during my life?^^
" Tommy and a woman,  we all know where this will ends"
goddamn let him answer the freaking question!
I absolutely loved this! I’ve never watched an interview all the way through but was captivated by both throughout the interview, I couldn’t take my eyes off my phone. Very well done.
Do should collab together in a movie. Yk, Scarecrow and harley quinn, right?
Cillian and Margot need to be in a movie together.
These two individuals are undoubtedly quality human beings. It’s quite refreshing for me to hear how kind and honest each are to both themselves and others.
Funny he doesn't seem to want to talk about himself and kept turning the conversation back to her which doesn't really surprise me from what I've seen in other interviews with him
Two fine actors, but both movies were dead boring, sorry.
Why does everything need to be talked about, broken down, analyzed to the micro detail, every living actor on earth mixed who have never even been in a movie together, and talk and talk and talk and go on about whatever for thousands of hours? It's MOVIES. It's not that goddamned important
i love this video so much
These two really took over and owned the Summer of 2023.
Man how to make your dream into reality i want to meet this guy like seriously there r people who r fans i’m not a fan of him i have a different feeling
They are a wonderful reflection of their respective movies and this conversation shows how they got along really well despite their contrasting personalities, which is a reflection of how we as moviegoers loved both Barbie and Oppenheimer.
thanks cillian
Theyre both so brilliant can we get a movie with both of them please???
They need to do a movie together
Margot word count: 999,999 Cillian word count: "Wow."  "Yeah."  "Eh."
cillian definately knows how to get a girl
The Peaky f*ing blinders crew for life!!!
Cillian Murphy is one of my all time favorite actors
O encontro perfeito ❤ lindos do meu coração
the perfect duo doesn’t exi-
The're both such great actors. This is great. Robbie is still underrated in my opinion.
They both played villians from DC
They are both so down to earth and humble! Loved this interview! 🙌🏻
Perfect conversation between an extrovert and an introvert...😂
Celts 💙
The Old couple
Somehow I want to see them act in a sci-fi movie about the first sentient AI couple in the future situation where AI gets oppressed by human biases and their own fear.
Ladies and gentlemen, our Doctor Doom
Margot inturupts a lot and she's self-centered.
twitter says that oppenheimer wouldn't be that massive if barbie wasn't made
She was the perfect choice for the role. Margot Robbie _is_ Barbie. Everything about her portrayal was flawless ❤.
Dislike just like I disliked Barbie. 👎
16:46   😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Hi cillian❤❤
I loved a lot of this discussion and I really respect both of these actors. The struggle for me while watching is that Margot says 5 sentences for every 1 by Cillian. Obviously, she's more outgoing and more famous, but it seems like Cillian never gets a chance to let his thoughts really breathe. He keeps getting cut off or cut short. It's really kinda annoying to watch because I want to hear both of them.
Love him lumping Orson Welles and Mister Rogers in with each other. Now there's a pair.
This is one of the best actors on actors that i've watched. I don't know if their questions are scripted by writers but they did have good questions at par with their artistic caliber. They don't over praise or fawn at each other  but I felt the respect and honesty in their answers. Very professional.
I kind of want to see the two of them work together now.
how did they get tommy shelby do this? crazy
Lol at her over analysis of barbie ..wth. it was a basic predictable role in a big standard woke movie blah blah.
9:42 "It's like an Inception of memes. A meme within a meme" What a great reference🤣🤌
M: We would dance every day , it was so fun .... C: Really? Awwwww (shoot me )
I like that they wore black and pink.
Margot's So Gorgeous.. ❤❤❤
can we please see them together in one movie
I loved both movies. I think they’re both brilliant! Thank u for this interview
19:00 - As someone who also makes a hundred decisions per day the decision fatigue is 100% real. I don’t want to decide what to wear or to eat. It does not matter. I need my brain wired to important decisions.
I feel like her Aussie accent is on full blast, and that happens when Irish / English / Welsh / Scots / Aussie folks speak to each other 😂
cillian and margot are both so beautiful, so talented, and so beautifully talented at what they do. i loved this interview so much, and i particularly loved cillian's shyness. he's such a humble man. hollywood NEEDS more actors and actresses like cillian and margot.
Barbie was a stupid movie.  We are all dumber for having watched it.
no idea what they talked about but man margot robbie is so fine
I wish the Barbenheimer vibe will be back. We don't need too many movies to make choices. We just need 2 perfect pairings of movies from great filmmakers. Thats a great celebration of cinema. I watched Oppenheimer in IMAXand Barbie in an eclectic small intimate movie theater and both experiences felt wonderful.
She's gorgeous and so smart, seems down to earth too. I really love her so much!
Probably the best interview I didn’t know I had to watch, until I watched it
It's kinda obvious but at the same time weird when you try to fast forward the video you'd always going to find Margot speaking
trust me, people weren't itching for the next greta gerwig film. As much as the marketing and cinematograhy was great in barbie. You can't even compare her with nolan, in any sense
😑
hope they won't make a sequel
What a great interview. I love both of them they are fantastic.
The power of meme culture, everyone
I adore how much of a process/movie nerd Margo is and how smart she is about filmmaking.  I'm glad they met at last!
Cillian : YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH😂😂
ahh meme cat guy
its nice to watch cillian murphy and margot robbie talk about their movie, it's overwhelming for new insights of their pov. very interesting, and I like these type of content.
Kudos to Greta and Margot .. and the scriptwriters .. in raising the bar, and thus saving this new Barbie movie from being reduced to an interminably syncopated meme-fest. Absolutely brilliant.
oh lord let him speak
Not interested.
I love them so much. They are my favorite
She's to intelligent to have the "like", sickness, so is he. I have trouble now focusing on what actors say in interviews because of that. Unfortunately the internet made us all develop terrible speaking habits. I'd really like to see this whole wokeness thing pass in Hollywood already and I think it is because these two would be great together in a a good film noir or erotic thriller, something for adults. It's time for the Joe Eszterhas type of writers to re-emerge. Fun, sexy movies that may not be realistic but give you a roller coaster like thrill when you watch them.  I love that people responded to Oppenheimer almost as much as Barbie but I'm wondering if people still appreciate good, mature, intelligently written movies done by other directors then Nolan. There's most likely so many good scripts out there and writers that don't see the light of day because of both greed, which is why you see so many prequels, remakes, etc. and the freaking politics.
So how long is she going to be contractually obligated to wear pink?
Wished i sold Barbie’s dolls that time
We need Christopher Nolan and Greta gerwig to do this
Margot Robbies film, was the biggest shit ever.... She is present it here as it was a masterpiece and it was 6.9 on IMDB Oppenheimer was masterpiece!
This was nice and everything but jesus it was like. . . 90% Barbie talk when Oppenheimer is the far far more interesting film :(   Missed opportunity to hear about all the incredible things they did with that film, this really should've been better moderated for equal time
45:00
Why isn’t anyone talking about how Margot asks him questions, doesn’t let him complete and starts to answer completely forgetting that he was supposed to answer that 😂  “what did your parents think?” *cuts him off mid answer* “do you know how I watched it?” Even with Chris wearing a suit lol
I've seen a lot of these, this was one of the best. Two very open people who were genuinely interested in the other persons insights. Very cool.
Aah shit ! Batman villains teaming up !
43:17 thank me later
I too listen to Cillian on the calm app 😌🤎 glad Margot mentioned that!
Like, I like Barbie but Margot is really chatting it up like it was so revolutionary, it really wasn't. A lot of people acted very badly like overacting plot wasn't too great either. Could have been so much better!
Doctor doom meets Harley Quinn 😊👍
This is the best story of Margot Robbie's life I have ever seen: https://youtu.be/eZeLANKsHzg
I. Love. This. So refreshing.
Now I see why she turned down Sue Storm. She wants to be her own thing - a cultural icon that stands apart from the roles she plays. I respect that. Like Elliot Page and Lady Gaga.
Margot Robbie is brilliant and deserves her success. She had a vision and made it happen
I can feel Margot's brain running a million miles per second. She's really not just a pretty face.
As a Cillian Murphy fan that I am , I didn’t like this interview, Margot didn’t let talk my Cillian … she seems like very arrogant, and her movie I didn’t like it. It’s a trash 🗑️
they are both so charming, love them

Видно, что им действительно было интересно говорить друг с другом и делиться историями о своих героях и процессе съёмки. По-моему, ни с одним репортёром не может получиться настолько интересного разговора. Восхищаюсь Марго и Киллианом и мечтаю увидеть их в одном фильме. Потрясающие актёры.
Great Conversation,and people i think ✌️😎✨
Im interested to know more about what Margot is talking about the cm difference between American and Australian palettes? Is that a real thing?
Теперь понятно, почему 5 миллионов просмотров, невероятное интервью, без странных паух и натянутых улыбок, просто два талантливых человека обсуждают хорошие фильмы, это прекрасно
No pun intended to these incredible actors and their fans, However MISSION IMPOSSIBLE DEAD RECKONING GOT OVERSHADOWED BY THIS BARBENHEIMER COMPETITION 😮😢😢 IT IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST AND MOST PRACTICAL MOVIE OF THIS YEAR!
I watched OPPENHEIMER 3 times in Dolby and IMAX! Barbie 2 TIMES and I think I SPEAK FOR EVERYONE, THIS YEAR HAS BEEN PHENOMENAL FOR ENTERTAINMENT AND FILMS! FAST X, JOHN WICK CHAP#4, MISSION IMPOSSIBLE DEAD RECKONING, EQUALIZER 3, THE NUN 2, AQUAMAN, WONKA, LAST VOYAGE OF DEMETER, TALK TO ME, GRAN TURISMO!!!!!
Barbie was a cultural phenomenon? Lol. Most embarrassing and disastrous messaging in a movie ever.
Margot Robbie is the ideal beauty w brains. The way she described the distance between hard and soft palate and it’s effect on different dialects 👏🏼, even Cillian Murphy was like wow!

Thomas Shelby being so nice!
Their shared love of Emily is great 🥰
I really didn't like Oppehheimer, nor did I care much for Cillian's performance of the title character. But my god is he an interesting actor.
Style and beauty. Perfect pairing
This is Thomas Shelby taking interview of Barbie 😄
un capo
Thats interesting to hear that, Christopher Nolan doenst have a mobile phone.
yeah - Oppenheimer
By order of the peaky blinders
Awesome
Really interesting hearing these two experienced actors discussing how they prepare for and develop these characters, actor to actor (yes I know it's the point of the series but I will continue to point out how unique and informative it is lol)
Margot Robbie: its just pure talent!
these actors talk make them seem so smug and egocentric
My admiration for these two is massively enhanced.
If a male actor can convince you of being peak masculine in a role without growing huge steroid induced muscles, then he is indeed a great actor. Cillian Murphy is a great actor.
i love the talk!!!!
I counted about a thousand "kinda like"))  Crimea. Ukraine.
Barbie and Oppenheimer ❤❤❤❤
cool
Margot Robbie says she's a huge fan, which sounds cool and weird at the same time😂❤
Cillian Murphy is the most overrated actor
mwahhhhhhh
ily
Scarecrow and Harley Quinn
off topic, can someone find the link to that podcast with the woman who doesn't have the inner voice
They are both so brilliant. Can we get them in a movie together ASAP?
She won’t stop talking. I wanted to hear from Cillian because of Peaky Blinders.
𝑺𝒐𝒚 𝒆𝒍 𝒖𝒏𝒊𝒄𝒐 𝒒𝒖𝒆 𝒍𝒐𝒔 𝑺𝒉𝒊𝒑𝒑𝒆𝒂? 😅
OMG barbenhiemer IRL!!!!!!!!
I feel like the AC wasn’t working in any of the theaters for Oppenheimer I was toasty 😂
Ah yes my favorite creator Barbenheimer
The person who paired them up deserves a raise. The person who paired them up deserves a raise.
Cilaie machine
Now we need Greta Gerwig and Christopher Nolan!
THIS! is my roman empire
this one of the best videos in this series ever. so grounded and insightful.
They need to do more of these where actors interview actors for 40 minutes
She interrupted him so many times😢
I L❤VE Murphy's blasé faces😂😂😂
cillian murphy's han movements are so calm and satisfying bro
Margot really demonstrates here what a phenomenal actress she is. Her devotion to the craft of storytelling and engaging with the audience is so telling in all the work that she does
By Order of the Peaky Blinders. But Peaky ended at Season 4. 5 and 6 were awful, Barbie was also awful, so don't make a number 2
Typical introverts respond "hmm, yeah, yes, uhuh"😂😂😂
I saw the Barbie Movie and it was a desaster. All men are stupid, incompetent and loosers. All women are great and have a hard life.  What a good massage for society.
C'était tellement interessant!! Merci de l'avoir fait. Ça aurait pu durer 3 heures que j'aurai été captivée de la même manière. Wow! Passionnant.
CILLIAN PLEASE
Imagine Margot Robbie in Peaky Blinders 🤩
Can't believe this was their first time meeting in person, the conversation flowed  effortlessly well❤❤
43:13 😘🔥👌
i cannot possibly fathom how beautiful margot robbie is. i dont mean her looks, we all know she’s got it. but she just seems so authentic and fun and just a really great person to have a conversation with.
just IMAGINE if they get a directors view on this too. Christopher & Greta
Perfect pairing of the lead stars in two of 2023's arguably biggest movies "Barbie" and "Oppenheimer".
Now we need a directors on directors starring Christopher Nolan and Greta Gerwig
They're secretly planning to end Bruce Wayne
im sorry but the urge to try to comb the back of her hair is too real
You are both inspirational actors and need to pat yourselves on the back for being down to earth
The fact that they were able to lock Cillian into an interview is impressive.
Of course Christopher Nolan doesn’t have a phone
Want them in a romantic movie
So far im in love with their dynamic. So natural and authentic. I have to set aside a perfect time to watch this entire interview just because he's one of my favorite actors and i have such respect for his craft.
A indústria cinematográfica
I wish spoke English as their 😭
Cillian Murphy specifically requested to do this interview with Margot, and she was thrilled to join in. Real recognizes real
What if Harley Quinn loaded a nuclear warhead into her hammer?
14:24. Cillian wait patiently for Margot to say finished
10:42. Great movie of all time 😊😊😊😊❤❤❤❤❤
26:13 They are complementing each other
They should work together ❤❤❤❤❤
this is cute 🥰
The bone structure in this interview is immaculate 👌💯
So much symmetry in this screen omg! And talent obviously
Watched the entire interview just to hear them talk about “peaky blinders”
Cillian Murphy is a very great actor.
We need anne hathaway and jake gyllenhaal
thanks
Oppenheimer meets barbie
As a BIG Margot fan and BIG Cillian Murphy fan, I am over the moon. Plus, Margot is a Cillian Murphy fan? I didn't think I could love her more!!!
timestamps?
barbenheimer is literally the best thing that happened in 2023, i loved both movies so much and i just cant really move on so thanks variety for this episode with these two!!!
thank you margot for asking peaky things on chillian 😂❤
‘90% of me was certain’… I’m 100% positive she might or might not be smart.
💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜🔆🆙
He’s just an extraordinary example of what a working man can achieve
So much love and admiration and respect for these amazing actors 🫶🏼
Wow❤❤
This was so fun to watch 😭 They are both such nice people.
amazing episode
Anyone have a Yeah counter for cillian?
Great convo!
Margot Robbie just said: Greta gerwig is a ph.d, but she's not.
Barbie is so overrated
Doomer wojak has conversation with Stacy
Barbie doesn’t need a sequel
I cant look at Margot Robbie an not think of Harley Quinn. My favorite female actor to date Obviously, "Tommy" is the favorite😏
Lovely couple though 😍
Who brought them together is Genius. ❤
That was a good one. 👍😎
How has there not been a Daniel Radcliffe and Elijah Wood: Actors on Actors?!
peaky blinder: 43:12
For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” —John 3:16 God loves all of us God loves everyone with an everlasting love. He is the father of our spirits. We are His children. He loves each one of us individually and wants us to come to know and love Him. He sent His Son Jesus Christ God knew that this life would be full of challenges and uncertainty. He knew that we would fall short and make mistakes. So He sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to earth. Jesus lived a perfect, sinless life. He taught His gospel and showed us the right way to live. He willingly gave his own life as a sacrifice for our sins. He is our loving Savior and Redeemer.
J'adore ces yeux, elle est magnifiquement rayonnante. TE AMO BARBIE. si toi la femme de ma vie vois ce message stp je te cherche partout mais je ne te trouve pas. Donne estes tu y tu Alma Blanca. Amor y Esperanza para todos.    🐨  🐢  🦣  🦁  amor y esperanza para ti amor de mis amores.
hollyweirders are so full of themselves they now have to interview themselves too ?
Oh man does she love talking..A little bit of listening wouldn't hurt.  Even her endless questions are for interrupting, not for listening to the answer.
Is she British?
The producers pairing up the actors really are doing a great job, like Emily Blunt with Anne Hathaway, Mark Ruffalo with Robert Downey Jr, and obviously this…really genius !! I also love how they were both complimenting Emily at 41:24, they seemed really genuine :)
An Irishman n an Australian do an interview, n u can barely hear their accents
the fact they are also both Batman villains is so perfect
If they were to get together their babies would be beautiful
How about a shmaltzy 90s RomCom starring these two?
Deseo con mi alma que protagonicen una excelente película estos dos. Siento que ambos disfrutaron de la platica. Amé como Cillian le preguntaba y ella se soltaba hablando y el bien interesado escuchandola! ¡El sueño!!!. Ella también le preguntaba a el y como es más seriecito creo que interactuaba muy bien con el. Me encanto! Amo a quien se le ocurrio juntarlos!!💖💖💖
Murphy is levels above Robby
Now we just need an excellent movie starring these two🤩
She was absolutely amazing in Babylon.
I love margot hoping for a Peaky Blinders movie because I agree
That's really funny, I like Cillian doesn't get memes the same way.
Kinda Crazy Harley and Scarecrow getting spotlight together 😂
Hey look it’s Barbenheimer in the flesh!
They made Cillian Murphy ask questions... He ate people, and questions...
Margot Robbie is the Universal Standard Unit of WHITE.
both of them sre cute omg
Margo is so authentic and charming while Cillian seems to  truly enjoy talking to her, in his introvert asking-questions-not-talking way. Absolutely wholesome interview.
Cillian is the best man ever
OMG Margot shipping Cill/Chris 😂
I've never seen an interview where Margot looked this shy. Cute♡
Is it just me or Cillian Murphy has an american accent here ? Or he is irish and im so bad at recognizing accent ?😅
Is he gay ?
Thomas Shelby and Harley Quinn would be best friends
I liked❤
Amazing ❤
Томас Шелби красава
0:52 Akala ko si Oli London
oppenheimer is far better than cringe barbie
"IT HAPPENED BECAUSE BOTH MOVIES WERE GOOD" 😂😂😂...CILLIAN, THE FACT THAT YOU, STARRING IN SUCH INTELLIGENT ROLES (OR AT LEAST ROLES WITH BASIC FUNCTIONING 😂😂) WOULD GIVE INTO SUCH A LEVEL OF SUBHUMAN RETARDATION THAT IS THAT WOKE-TARDIC, INCOHERENT BS WHICH POINTS OUT ALL THE RETARDATION OF OUR CURRENT SOCIETY...THEN AGAIN, MARGOT STARRED IN IT AS THE LEAD ROLE, BUT COME ON, NOW 😂😂
Oppenheimer was a masterpiece of art and Barbie was a masterpiece of trash...and it literally shows the spectrum of intelligence in our society...or just the retardation of putting those two together, meaning society is THAT retarded 😂😂😂
16:39"... or Emma Thomas, his wife and producer, she called me because Chris doesn't have a phone" Now that's how You keep being creative in Nolan-regions of creativity I reckon
Mom and dad!!!!
34:31 When I saw this in the movie, I wondered why she acted so cruel to Ken after the dance scene, in terms of being such a mean doll, if Ken didn't even know what sex or love is. However, I thought that It was just my perception and probably people or the director might perceive it as a feminist act or something like that. Like: 'did y'all see that?? she's da feminist queen/women doesn't have to accept every proposition of men'. Now I understand that it's part of the evolution of the character; Barbie was actually being unintentionally cruel because she didn't have emotional abilities in that part of the movie.
As an Irishman, hearing Margot Robbie say at 27:07 "the Irish have a great rep" made me feel strangely tingly...
Actors on actors? More like cheekbones on cheekbones, am I right? Someone needs to cast them opposite each other. They have great chemistry here and wow are they both gorgeous!
I watched Barbie the other day at the request of my sister. I understood the point the movie was trying to convey (that the patriarchy is bad for both sexes, correct me if I'm wrong), but I don't think it did it very well. Perhaps that's why Barbie was seen as somewhat divisive. I think the section in the movie that highlighted that the patriarchy is bad for men was more rushed, thus diminishing its importantance. Almost like it was a footnote or an afterthought. Similarly, with the quip at the end regarding corporations not really caring about anything as long as they make money. It kind of felt as though the movie was too focussed on making a statement at the expense of the story. Personally I'm of the view that well-written movies put the story first and the message is more implicit thus giving the opportunity to the viewer to consider their own thoughts on the matter after watching rather than the opinions of the writer being so apparent. Ultimately I think they did a disservice to the cause they were trying to bring attention to, as demonstrated by how divisive the comments were on the film afterwards.
Como amo a margot robbie 😍 Muchas bendiciones para ella y su familia
Their outfits match their movie themes.
I fast forward all the man parts 😅
still cant understand how was barbie not a flop,but instead a huge success even way better than oppenheimer...weird world we live in
as soon as cillian murphy mentions the audience not being told what to watch, margot robbie seems to get more defensive. i don't like that.  edit: i think margot robbie is desperate to maintain control. because she knows that the bullying tactics of activism is something that she is using as leverage.  i have lost my respect for her. i can still respect that she does stuff. but she really doesn't care about who she steps on. which is fine. just disheartening.
The fact that these two movies are even being compared blows my mind.
Margot fangirling at the end is sooooo lovely ❤
a lot of people wouldn't watch Oppenheimer if it wasn't for Barbie. like there were people watching Oppenheimer just because Barbie was fully booked. I cant believe those men had the audacity to ask to delay Barbie so their own movie could be prioritised.
Many men (incels) here thinking that Cillian is faking his reactions because THEY have never actively listened to a woman before is sending me. Talk about projection. He asked for her as a partner. I am sure he is genuinely listening.
It's the Barbenheimers.
Cilian faking yeaaaah😂
Who all Just skipped the entire barbie bits
Margot Robbie let Cillian talk from time to time. Listen! As he did
Barbie connected with audiences because general audiences that watch movies are f*cking stupid. What happened around 2014 that they only make shitty movies after then.  They used to be so great for the previous two decades.
Scarecrow and Harley Quinn - A Day in Arkham. But seriously what a great conversation. Margot is awesome, yes I'm gorgeous and yes I'm smart and no I won't play down either. And Cilliannnnn with his two Earths for eyes :))))
I feel like a refined person out of all sudden and it's great.
I'm so glad I was alive for Barbenheimer. Truly an event in cinema.
Cilian Murphy was great in Batman begins. It's not say often.
This was so interesting and wholesome. 🥰  I love both of them so much, great actors ❤
Cillian is a 10. no but=)
Put subtitles in Portuguese, please
cillian and his fake reaction😅😀
We Cillian, need someone like Margot who can talk on after we introverts ask a question 😁
Please do one with Bella Ramsey!
An Irishman and an Australian walked into an interview 👍
Put these two in a movie together as love interests immediately
I don't even know what "Variety" is, found this by pure chance. This is astounding inspiration for being a better professional. I'm in awe.
I’m a Barbie girl I am become death in a Barbie world the destroyer of worlds…!!!
Dang almost 5M views
Can't decide who has the more beautiful blue eyes
Well Dr Crane and Dr Quinzel finally have their own therapy session
I'd love to see that concept evolve at some point, just for the heck of it you know, but actors on actors but instead of already settled and very big actors being face to face, I'd love to see like "veteran actor face to face with acting student" facing each others and how they see each others, what they've heard of the other, seeing the doubts, the confiance and struggle reflects in both ways. Or like "cinema actor facing theater actor", "Circus actor facing Broadway actor", ...  That would be so different and give of a totally different vibes. Though it's still fun to watch ^^
i could listen to cillian say ‘nice to chat here margot’ every day on repeat until i die
if I would meet her I would greet her with: hello lovely feet queen 😍😂😂
That feeling you feel with CGI where it looks "Real" but something is not quite right is call the "Uncanny Valley"
The way Cillian answer every question. Im just lost in his eyes. 😅 Whole ep i was looking at him  I don't know why😂😂
God, Margot Robbie is so humble. The Barbie movie worked only because of her, tbh
This dude should have been ken. I mean just look at this dudeee
God I love them so much
The Barbenheimer was definitely the true cinematographic event of this year 💜
Margot being an absolute fangirl was so brilliant and adorable
Cillian's blue eyessss. 😍😍😍
i love Murphy so much
9:20 "dial up phone" 😂
This is everything I ever wanted and I didn't even know it
He’s sooooooo hot ahhhhhhhhhh I’m sorry ignore me
so Barbenheimer is real
im upset that there will never be another barbenheimer but im glad i experienced it
the fact that this has the most views compared to the other videos lmao their power
That Barbenheimer was the closest thing to a "blockbuster-event".
Thomas Shelby meet Harley Quinn
Such a great interview format. They ask each other good and interesting questions. I prefer this much more than a interviewer - actor format
Please be rate 15 like the orignal series. Not like what they did to welcome 2 america
watching this really makes me like them even more
Thank you Margot for opening Peaky Blinders and ask about the movie :D
Seeing these 2 chat is so Satisfying to listen to & watch. Great fucking video & pairing👍🏾👍🏾
Margot Robbie is not only, probably, the prettiest women of our age, but also an amazing actress. She needs to pull a Charlize Theron and do a "Monster" movie where her looks have no factor, she would nail it.
Now make a movie with these two. They have all this chemistry with each other which comes so easily.
I love Margo usually....but did anyone else really dislike Barbie?
Is Cillian acoustic? Margo saved this interview
It’s just acting, you aren’t making miracles
Never thought i'd say this but the Irish lad seems more laid back than the Aussie.
12:50 Cillian saying cool, Could be a great meme
🩷🖤
A sigma with a doll😂😂
Peaky blinders stuff starts here 43:12  Thank me later!😉
Cillian Murphy taking the Barbie movies seriously. Just goes to show what a great actor he is.
idk whether she acts confused or just tryna have everyone’s eyes on her. she said no one cares but it’s obvious that she herself did. does she need a masterclass from harry? i believe people eventually do not care abt your sexuality, but billie just made it a big deal than the interviewer who genuinely asked the question. i love billie and her music but they way she acts sometimes looks like a real spoiled brat who just makes a big deal out of everything 💀
Thomas fooking Shelby 🗿
Could she stop interrupting... Yeeez
I can see being a film producer would be fun if you had the resources and money behind you cause you can make dream projects with dream workers if you know how to get the right people together
The person who paired them up deserves a raise. The person who paired them up deserves a raise.
so I realize I am as in love with Margot much more mentally
The sad part is how bad both movies were. Really, really bad. Pretentious and ridiculous in both cases and just plain fiction in both cases, only not in a good way. It's just that we had nothing else to see all summer. In fact there has hardly been anything to see in theaters for years. So it's no surprise that movie titled "Barbie" and a Chris Nolan movie brought people to the theaters at the same time. I was excited to see both, but sincerely offended and pissed off for having paid to be so disappointed in both. I don't want to encourage movies like these to be made. It's lazy storytelling. It's not timeless like previous works and so much of the writing these days lacks philosophy and character development, it's sad that it's accepted as the norm. I love Cillian and Margot but they need to pick better projects. It's not just money guys, these movies are raising kids and influencing people. Some of us take it personally when all we had as parents were movies and shows. It's a big responsibility outside of just thinking you're making something to make money.
i aint gonna waste my 48 mins on this. enough with this PR
His voice is so different in interviews compared to the movies, much deeper
At this rate, Will Farrell is going to be making an appearance as a corporate head for EVERY toy company
Margot Robbie interrupted him like soo many times
Cillian makes me proud to be from the same island as him, no facade, polite and natural, true to himself, a real master of his craft. Margot Robbie is phenomenal too, both amazing people.
I feel like I'm being described at 32:00 onwards haha
They would make the perfect child in the entire history of time
"People have specific and wide range of taste" -Margot Robbie.
'Course ya'll did this combination of people. 🙄😄
so, she is responsable for the trash, she wasn't just an actor
Anyone know the name of the This American Life episode?
Two insanely good looking people
this chic will not quit yapping
Cillian Murphy is giving the performance of his life pretending to be present for this contractually obligated promotional segment.
Who else loves Cillian Murphy?
She just won't stop interrupting Cillian will she?
two powers players in the same room.  i see a healthy tension, taking notes.
Margot Robbie’s toilet is my mouth
It must be so weird for Cillian that all of his interviews about this serious biopic he was in now inevitably lead to him having to talk about a studio comedy he wasn’t in and wouldn’t do.
This was amazing.
ay besense
She became a fan when she asked about Tommy Fockin Shelby! Thanks for asking about the spin of movie. Hahaha
I'm a fan of Cillian Murphy.
❤😊
Great episode, I just wish he would have talked more about his movie. So much more could have been asked about Oppenheimer 😢
I love Margot but I will say she’s not great at interviewing because she interjects too much, not giving chill Cillian time to get his sentences out. I used to do that, and I do it when I’m excited, but my training as a health coach has helped me become a better listener. I’m sure Margot’s just excited and trying to engage. Cillian is so chill and opposite her personality that the pace he thinks and speaks probably kills her to wait!
I completely agree: there are two groups of people in this world. One group is obsessed what peaky blinders, and the other hasn’t even seen it.
They're both visionaries and it's so beautiful to see them talk about the stories they've featured in. Breaking down scenes and roles and the complexities of the roles they played
Cillian Murphy is a visionary and adapts to his role, Margot is flexible in everything she does and her passion for acting is colourful
When it's Cillian speaking; the world doesn't scroll down.
Margot is obnoxious. Murphy is so humble.
They even look alike (their cheekbones)😊
I think Margot was blushing a bit at the end 😊😂
Barbemheimer was like Doom X Animal Crossing of the movie industry. Glorious.
Cillian murphy🤝chris nolan❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Oppenheimer 💥
Couldn’t finish Barbie, and the other one started to watch, got bored, and switch to listening Malcolm Gladwell about this persona, which is much more interesting.  Both movies were failures to me…
w
I really,really enjoyed this. It captures the magic of Barbenheimer❤️
HE IS SO HOT 🔥
Please don't compare Christopher Nolan and Greta. They are talking like these two are on the same level.
Open barbie❤❤❤
Anjelina jolie, Cilian Murphy, Margo Robbie and Emma Mackie all look like cousins
Idk but I somehow can’t put these two movies or these two directors on the same level or even the same category. Can’t even take the comparison seriously. I do see how Barbenhiemer was so monumental but individually Nolan owns the ropes
28:46 One magical movement from Kether to Malkuth!
Just shows good writing makes people love cinema- not the trash Disney has been putting out recently
INCREDIBLE
first saw this with  doom and animal crossing the juxtaposition of two completely different things works like a charm
Margot If you're gonna do another Barbie movie, just completely ditch the whole gender stuff. Make a series instead maybe. We know you loved being Barbie, my personally your Harley Quinn is absolute perfection.
Don't put Margot Robbie on Cillian Murphy, what's wrong with you? 🫢
Tommy foken shelby!!!
My gosh this is one sexy man.
Tom Cruise and Matt Damon pairing please 🥺
I love how they asked each other about what their parents thought of their movies
Barbeinheimmer!!
What a great conversation. Very soothing to. Almost ASMRish. I really enjoyed it.
So disappointed that I tuned in for a conversation between two actors but it ended up being 80% Margot and 20% Cillian. Would have loved hearing more from him but she totally stole the spotlight. You can tell halfway through that he just gives up and defaults to interviewer mode. He can't get much through her verbal assault.
An amazing conversation between two actors. Loved every minute of it.
43:12 about Peaky Blinders
The person who paired them up deserves a raise. The person who paired them up deserves a raise.
I love the vibes of these two!!. Hope to see them working together on a movie soon
7:11 the 21 of July is my birthday 🎉
I need to see them as Bonnie and Clyde omg please.
Excellent interview.  Both come across as very nice and down to earth.  Also seems like Margot has lost her Australian accent.  She sounds American.
She was just sooooo fan vibes when she started asking him about peaky blinders 😂😂😍
Such a great pairing, two people so passionate about their craft. Would be great to see them work together on a movie.
So funny he blushing at the end when she is talking about how fan of him she is 😂😂 but honestly, I’m so happy that she was our voice and asked him about the peaky blinders sequence. Like, how there’s no sequence? It’s impossible!
43:15 love that she asked this question 👏👏👏 Tommy Shelby is one of the most loved and iconic characters in history.
How can you not love Margot energy 😍 it brushes well on Cillian ❤️
i am just here to see cillian murphy for48 minutes
*47:58** Guys we found our Dr. Doom & Susan Storm 🗿*
Good Lord Margot.... 😍🤤
she's distractingly beautiful. great convo
Scarecrow and Harley Quinn
Unpopular opinion: Idk If because of all the hype these movies got but to me they were both shit lmao boring af. Again, I think it was the high expectations I had because of all the ppl hyping about it.
the best possible tutorial on how to listen to a woman)) Number of "yeah" from Cillian is incredible
Now if Peaky Blinders movie does happening eventually, I want Maggot to have a part in it!
Margot Robbie is in awe of cillian Murphy almost as if she has a crush on him 🥹🥹
Scarecrow & Harley together 😎
what an amazing talk 👏
25:35 Australian vs American accent palette 🤯 so interesting to learn about
She is Harley Quinn
Barbie was trash and oppenheimer a masterpiece.
Oh, I just love these kind of interviews you get to know the actors and what it takes to create original movies like that, and to be in their headspace for just a little bit. And get to know them better. What would I give to be an actress and to have an interview with Cillian Murphy?!! ❤❤❤
Now make a movie with both of them as lead actors, thank you in advance.✨(it's already happening i'm sure)
The person who played tommy shelby is the best actor of all time for me. Barbie was just a marketing success not a great movie Peaky blinders literally defined what a good tv show is
Does anyone know the name of the podcast Margot is talking about ?
So romcom with these 2?
This was the bomb (😉)
I loved it. Both are eloquent and real class.
"lets get together ya ya ya"
This girl is literally the perfect genes in human form
😈 Barbie
Such a great episode. So insightful, funny and just pure joy to watch!
Tommy fucking Shelby
BARBENHEIMER
Two people who carried 2023
CM for oscar
The person who paired them up deserves a raise. The person who paired them up deserves a raise.
She doesn't let him finish his sentences. Or speak very much.
hoping they will get a film together as a hot villain couple 😍
Barbenheimer finally happened ❤
First of all this interview is fire and I love just watching them talk so honestly and humbly about their movies and careers. Secondly, I can stare at Margot Robbie for 24 hours  straight and not get bored.
OKAY VARIETY FOOT ON THE GASS
Son tan hermosos 😍
This was a great pairing and first time ive ever watched one  of these great to see one of our own Cillian murphy 🇨🇮 in such an in depth conversation and having a laugh and of course the amazing talented Aussie margot Robbie being such a great speaker in how Barbie was made.
30:20
They’re chemistry free.
i mean, what a perfect interview.
I love that she is such a fan of cinema and film. Definitely saw a new side of both of them. Great interview!
Cillian and Margot's dynamic is one where you would think it would be something so odd because of how almost paradoxal it is, but this interview with them paired together honestly couldn't have worked out better. Both of them are so humble and grounded in their respective crafts, and it was so easy to just sit and admire them for who they are
Yes. So smart to pair them here! Yes, one very smart way to make him open up: Margot R! 👍🏽😄
first Actors on Actors that i finished watching
Cinema. Love Margot Robbie's point of view and how she talked to him as a friend even if she never met him before. Love Cillian Murphy's too and the imitation of Nolan even if he said he can't imitate ahahah
I just love Cilian Murphy even more knowing it was him requesting Margot Robbie as a partner for this interview!!
Cillian such a talent man
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
I won't watch anything with Zegler in it.          She's one of these horrible woke people who spreads hate and feeds the flame of culture wars. Thus, if she's in a movie, there is a high probability that the movie is going to be another of these woke writing disasters.           Hollywood has been ruining stories for years now, like The Witcher, and The Silmarillion (etc...I could give so many more examples), which are also some of my other favorite books, I wish I hadn't watched the show/movie adaptations. I've learned my lesson. Not taking the risk with this one, especially with someone like Zegler in it. Sometimes a beautiful book is better off remaining a beautiful book. Fool me once shame on me; fool me for 3 years and I'm out
this is geniusb
we need a movie with these two, I felt they had a lot of chemistry!
Barbie definitely wants Tommy Shelby
It's always fascinating how whether someone has an internal monologue or not, everyone is always shocked when they find out the other version is real!  (I dont have an internal monologue but I have heard of people who do - e.g. Margot Robbie apparently)
So wholesome ❤
Can tell she's inner fangirling ahaha
Lets just be clear on one thing here. Cilian Murphy is on a different level stratosphere and Margot Robbie does not come anywhere near it. This interview portray them as equals or on equal footing because of the success of the movies but in terms of range of characters played and screentime on top of that the experience. Cilian Murphy is centuries ahead of Margot. Now bdfore everyone comes at me for being sexist or stuff, if this was Cillian murphy with Julia robers or Meryl streep then they would take the crown 👑.  But Oppenheimer was the better movie, story telling, art, ..the movie was a whole package.
I hope they work together, they have the same type of acting with their eyes. Really intense.
I'm looking for the movie "World of calm" with Cillian Murphy, can I see it on YouTube?
OH NO THEYRE HOT
Cillian's smile in 15:52. That's it.
Can someone just give Cillian Murphy and Margot Robbie their own movie to do together?
Jesus Christ!! How can a woman be this this fucking awesome!! What a witty, smart, beautiful, wise, sweet and totally mesmerising woman. Did I forget talented? Where can a man get a clone? Never mind clone, baby, get a divorce quick while I'm still pretty. ❤
Barbie has been an icon for years now I’m just so glad that real life movie was brought to our screens and I like how the directors of each movie explained some of the things they had to put in place in order to put the actors into the full role like it’s just so mesmerising I guess.
The fact that i have watched this on the 1st day itself , oppenheimer on 10 am show and them barbie on 4pm show. It makes me feel that i am lucky to watch these on big screens . ❤❤
You no, if there was kind of like a spin-off movie I would love it to be based Polly Gray, but unfortunately she passed on, because I won’t lie, there was a lot of mystery surrounding her character. I would have loved to get some insights on her personal life in peaky blinders probably the parts involving her son Michael.   May the Helen McCrory rest in perfect peace.
Margot is just so gracious and charming
lol he was talkin abt not being comfortable seeing himself on screen and she thought he was talkin abt just being seen in general and brought up facemasks hahahha, yea thought that was funny lol
Margios a savage: because you still use a dial up! & a few other acts. But because she's got a pretty face & an aussie accent with a soft tone, everyone thinks she's so nice!
Civilian trying to stop himself from saying fag, realising it means something different in america, & then just daying ot anyway is the best thing about this, he dgaf!
margot's just like "omg, im talking to thomas shelby"
43:15 there it is the part you're looking for talking about "peaky blinders" tap on it 🎉
Cillian Murphy is awesome! He nailed Peaky Blinders!
I wonder if Jonathan Crane and Harleen Quinzel was in the same Phd-class?
my two favourite people
Ok now make a movie together you two 🤩
Everybody love Cillian Murphy
I saw your movie once upon a time in Hollywood...   My fav
This was so freaking sweet to watch
I had no idea Cillian was this jacked
I thought playing Oppenheimer must be more difficult than Barbie, turns out I was totally wrong❤ they both are genius
It's crazy how even their personalities are so opposite. Their representation to each movie is fascinating
Margot I love you but let Cillian talk please
Hopefully someday they can star in a movie together!
The most driest conversation I've ever seen
BARBENHEIMER ❤❤🔥🔥🗣🗣🙏🙏
FATHER AND MOTHER
Shoot a cool movie dont pay for marketing
Barbenheimer!
The way you can tell Margot is such a big fan of cillian
@4:53 oh hell yes
4 milion views and a half in 6 days😂
Smd
I will always remember the day that I saw these two movies. I had been living in an apartment with my best friends for a month. We played it out in advance to take a break from our non stop work schedules and we went to Good Will to get clothes to match the movies. We saw Oppenheimer first and then Barbie. We had enough time in-between movies to go and change for Barbie and it was so much fun. I will never get over the energy of the movie theater for those movies. It had been a long time since the movie theater has felt like that to me and it was just so much fun.
The success of Barbie and Oppenheimer show that it is possible to make a successful movie that isn't a made for China superhero part 27 movie.
My two personalities talking to each other inside my head.
Woahh this is iconic
I would watch 3 hours of this
Tbh barbie is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.
They carried summer of 2023 single-handedly
Wow,such a fantastic video uploaded..
this is an amazing interview
Love this talks ❤❤❤
i literally sat through watching the entirety of this interview 🥹🖤🩷 super love this
TE AMO CILLIANNNNNNN🩷🩷🩷
Now Ryan Gosling and Robert Downey Jr.
Ship
Wow. That was a truly refreshing interview. I love both movies as well as the work of both actors.👏🙂👏That was a great time.
She keeps interrupting him, let him finish!!
Barbieheimer 🙌
The thought of Chris Nolan in a Hawaiian Shirt is so funny.
Hands down the best Actors on Actors interview. Ever. Cillian and Margot are such gems in themselves, so coming together for this thoughtful back and forth was so special. My first time actually getting through an entire AoA episode!! <3
Where's Ryan ??
Oh, they're both so naturally polite and charming I just can't... Brilliant talk!
Cillian’s Calm sleep stories is the best! So relaxing.
Didn’t realise how insufferable she was until I watched this.
Que foda essa conversa ❤
Hablan más de Barbie, y yo queria escuchar más a Cillian
That was great. Very enjoyable and interesting watch. Thank you!
Sorry, but Margot talking about the Barbie movie like it was such a deep, clever, and unique plot is devastatingly laughable 😅😂
43:30 XD
This was fabulous! Great interview on both sides and so charming. :) Loved it.
She shud let him complete his sentence well. He was listening calmly to her.
Cillian: "I do sometimes, do you!?" Margot: "No." Cillian:  =0
Podcast of the year 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Thank you two for bringing back cinema ❤
I remember her acting like offended when Brad Pitt years ago compared  her to a Barbie doll🫣 She was like: Barbie?😧NO!✋🏼  And now not only she plays Barbie but also she likes people calling her that way🤯
I get jealous when she smiles
I didn't even realise how time flew by as I was watching this. Such a good video/interview honestly
I just love the fact that they know their thing about how making the film, the machines, the IMAX.. sometimes we think actors just act, bit these two really love their job. ❤
There’s 2 things this world needs  1. Margot and Cillian to work together   2. Margot working with Nolan and Cillian to work with Greta  Okay maybe 3 things
I had no idea she had Australian accent.. her New York/ Long Island accent in wolf of Wall Street made me think she was a nyer😮wow
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl6ORzlFQGk
Loved this interview, especially Margot geeking out on IMAX cameras and on Peaky Blinders. They are both so smart and sincere. This world needs more of their energy.
Cillian could of smashed if he acted like Thomas Shelby
Are there any big actors in Hollywood that are actually American
Drooling over this man
Cillian looks like Levi from AOT.
She talks too much also I know we have to have fun  while we’re working but she’s sound like she’s a teenager ( no hate )
honestly, it was the best actors' conversation I've seen in a long time, they can keep the high level of speaking so detailed and harmonically about their movies for so long and I still feel that I could hear them talking even for hours, they're both legends and the massive success they had through the whole process and releasement just prove how good they are, loved that.
I think the reality is that tension between genders is at an all time high with the phenomenon of morons like Andrew Tate and Joe Rogan, and any excitement by women *must* be countered by men. I think Oppenheimer would have had a third of its success if it wasn't for men simply wanting to counter the excitement of women by seeing a film that is the exact opposite of Barbie. Ultimately, as per usual, women prevailed, and it was yet another reminder of the power of women's consumer dollars on industries. Margot Robbie was kind not to reminder Cillian that the success of Oppenheimer was simply a casualty of men proving that the patriarchy exists while actively shouting that it does not.
A lot of cheekbone in this video
beautiful, perfect, that’s no words, I just love it!!!!!
I’ve love it so much!!!!!!
perfeitoooooo!!!!!
An introvert and an extrovert: The interview.
Them being paired up and wearing Barbie pink and black outfits, yasssss.s
Que conversa boa
Thomas Shelby at 43:00
Cillian talking for 48mins straight, toughest thing Cillian has done.
They really went full Barbenheimer
Can we get Greta Gerwig and Christopher Nolan in a room together? :)
They're so pretty together ❤
I love them both so much.❤❤❤Such a good discussion.
:))))))))) essa foi a melhor ate agora. eu sou barbenheimer
Cillian isn't even speaking 😂😂
The “you facist” part elicited a “oh yah, she’s a real Mussolini…” from someone in the theatre and I gagged😂😂
Barbenheimer together at last!  💕🖤 Great video to see the two of them together and finally talk about the phenomena they created. I’ll be rooting for both of them at the Oscars!
Barbenheimer 🔥❤
would be better if cillian was nude. jk.
You can just see how intelligent and smart margot is..she's the perfect example of beauty & lots and lots of brains
its funny how barbie was the only reason oppenheimer even reached anywhere near $900mill mark.
We need Sandra bullock and cate Blanchett to do this
because GOD so loved the world that he gave his only son (JESUS) so that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life. jonh 3:16

Guys the audio whattttt have you done. Gate too high? But also sounds like its heavily compressed
I love them
I want him to do me
Супер мега харош
the aesthetic thumbnail got me clicking 😂
The Barbenheimer phenomenon was so crazy. Usually when two big movies come out simultaneously, one suffers greatly. But in this case, both movie actually helped the other movie succeed evm more.
The Awesomeness!  😊👍👌😆👊✊🍁
i cant decide whom is prettier between these two. 🤣
I love these people so much
43:22
The reference about the PHD woman who can't introspect is PURE GENIUS from Greta. Impressive association to make with a Barbie character. Wow
This is awesome
Good to know that Greta, Margot, and company fought to keep that tasteless smallpox joke in the movie. Yikes.
43:30 is the time they talked about tommy shelby peaky blinders. Thank me later
Isn't that Barbie's blazer ?
DIOS MIO, todos amamos a Cillian, es perfectoooooooooooooooooooooo
This was amazing! Thank you so much
When Cillian said "Very formal setting" at the end of the interview, i'm not sure... i found that hilarious as the camera zoomed out and showed up the actual set 😂😅
These two def read the comments. They should do a project together.
People need to shut up about Margot talking too much. Cillian loves it. Everyone knows he hates talking about himself & even his projects to a certain extent. He'd rather just do the work and go home. Margot is a great conversational partner
Alguém traz essa entrevista em português
thank you Margot for asking about peaky blinders 🙏
Margot being a little fan of Peaky Blinders was adorable
hearing cillian asked to be paired with margot changed me as a person
A third through. Does Margo stop talking at some point and have a conversation?
Its nice to see Cillian Murphy play " Cillian Murphy" , and Margot Robbie play " Margot Robbie" .
Margo was so annoying jumping in every 1-2 sentences Killian was saying something. It is so easy to deviate from one's train of thoughs having someone push their view right away. She talked way too much. Unbalanced. You agree?
Stunning how they can talk to each other without feeling interrupted because they are on topic and comfortable participating and stimulating each other's point of view. Faboulous freestyle of interview, truly amazing!
Every time she says "process", we do a shot.
One of the best interviews!!! They're so humble, down to earth, smart and kind. It's clearly that they were so comfortable to talk with each other. I love it!!!
Why does Murphy have the face of a bogeyman? this guy is boring
Scarecrow and Harley Quinn😊
there are a handful of idiots who thought barbie was a good movie
Love both of their films and love these. two actors.  Thank you!
Two very talented, beautiful people! 👏
Never seen him,any calmer...wow
she might be married, but her playing with her ring clearly she is in awe of Cillian
33:39 - If anyone has the link to the podcast of the woman that cant introspect please post 👍🏻
So nice to see actual good, likeable actors that don't shit on fans and bring in politics into everything like Rachel Zegler
If the writing is good, the genre is moot.
In 43:20 they talking About Thomás Shelby.. to me Cilian Murphy its gonna be forever Thomás Shelby 😅
this is one damn good video
2 legends 😱
omg this is like the most one sided boring conversation I've ever seen HOW can people like this???
I love how Margot doesn‘t let Cillian get away with his modest attitude and really grills him in a charming way on subjects like his apparent unawareness of the memes and the reasons why Nolan loves to work with him.  You can really sense that she‘s 100% authentic and doesn‘t shy away from confidently stating that she knew that the movie was going to be a hit and that her performance was influential in convincing Matell.
Only I think that Margot overacts a little on shows like this?😅
Do you reckon Margot wants a role in the Peaky Blinders movie?
The Joker will be jealous of Harley getting smitten with Scarecrow
still upset that taylor swift was not called to be one of the BARBIESSSS AAAA. they missed the girliest girl of all time. i really wish to buy a taylor swift barbie. she's a bestfriend i wish i have
Понский пон
For everyone who is here for the Peaky conversation. 43min into the dialogue. Amazing show. For me it’s Sopranos, Peaky, then Breaking.
VAMOSSSSSSSSSS FINALLY……..🤌✨✨✨✨💅
robbie baby can you let him talk
I love how he just ask her questions, and keeps her talking. As a fellow introvert, what a classic move  Edit: 9k?!?😲 thank you guys! , stay hydrated!
As much as I enjoy Margot man she does NOT let the man TALK
Fun fact, every woman who cosplays as Harley thinks she looks like Margret Robin
Oppenheimer was a tremendous movie. Highly recommended. Barbie was a rather a satire of a satire of itself (most likely it was unintentional). I get what the movie was trying to convey, though in typical "current day" politics, it was backhanded and rather misandristic in a way for the usual "current day topic", which I suppose is expected for the current state of America. I recommend to watch both, but Oppenheimer is just so much better. Barbie is easily 3/10 with Gosling stealing the light and carrying most of the movie. At the very least Oppenheimer was more educational, while Barbie being too preachy and trying to get the message, instead of making sides understand each other, finishes with a dystopian ending and drives both sides even further apart.
is she married?
I love that Margo is still in her  "method dressing" looks with this blazer. Also an sit-down from 2 actors I never knew was coming   Here for both fashion and the talks  ✌🏻❄️
Such a rich conversation, I fully enjoyed every second of it 🤌🏻👌🏻
21st of July was a great day, I got outta jail after 5 months lol
This pairing was perfection. And they’re right. I was excited for both films and I watched them both the same weekend.
What a great chat, they have great chemistry. And it’s great to see Cillian so relaxed and engaged, it would be amazing to see a movie with them together! Margot is so excited about everything that you cannot not like her! And Cillian… what a charming man! ❤
43:14 Margot being a total fangirl, SHE’S ONE OF US ❤😂
Elegant,  very eleganto
i think margot may be one of my favourite people in the world
Sorry Margot but I must be one women inside that 10% that didn't like Barbie. I couldn't continue after the first 50 minutes, althought you make a good work..On the contrary I liked Babylon, that frantic, dramatic, crazy movie about the beginings of movies filmaking from the silent to the sonic movies. The scene of the endless repetitive take where you are all suffocating, specially the camera operator is priceless.
37:16 so that happened to everyone i see, it was hot af in that theater!!
Sungguh di luar nalar😅😅

Love this Variety, keep this style. More please, Anne and Emily was amazing and this is also so good. ❤️ ❤❤
She seemed very interested in the script being written in first person, is that not the usual run of things? It looked like it soaked an idea in her head
Didn't watch the whole thing. Its too long.  But big fan of cillian and I'm honoured ❤
The fact that Cillian pretends to be interested in talking about Barbie makes him a brilliant actor😄
I would simply pass away in front of Margot.
Well, I've been a fan of Cillian Murphy since Inception and In Time. Watching him in In Time, I never wanted to be a man until I watched Vin Diesel in The Fast and Furious but watching him in In Time I thought he looked cool and beautiful. Also, I'm so happy to be alive to experience the Barbenheimer experience. It was fun and cute to watch.
Thank you Margot for bringing up Peaky Tommy Shelby
most expressions cillian has ever given imo
I watched barbie for ken 🤝🏽
28:00 show me this as an ad for Youtube and not some scam games.
Margot Robbie better than me i would be a  blushing mess if it was me
barbieheimer
Man, what if Greta Gerwig and Chris Nolan were to come here!
Cant wait to work with them both🤍
Am I the only one that these 2 people are married? Jesus christ
This is a really good conversation
No lo dejó hablar! Margot...shhhh
Haha the dream pair we finally wanted 4 so long
21:45
Wow this interview was so good I sat down and watched without feeling bored which is not usual I love margot alot she has a great personality and I definitely fell in love with cillian more and more
I really believe the Oscar is his. He is the favorite at this time by Gold Derby voters. He is due. He has done extraordinary work in every movie he has been in to this point and he is well respected by his peers who will be voting. I love all his movies. He can swing from scary to sad to funny to the most beautiful woman ever in Breakfast on Pluto! He is the only actor of his age that truly disappears into each role in my opinion. When I remind people the movies he has been in they!!
If anyone steals his Best Actor Oscar this year then It'll be a blasphemy. A humble guy with extraordinary acting in the most successful biopic movie of all time, he has that golden trophy in his bag!!
He has 0 competition for the Oscar in my opinion, He murdered it!!
It's always a pleasure to listen Cillian Murphy. His personality, voice, thoughts, performances  me admire him more and more!!
I HOPE HE WINS THE OSCAR...HE IS A CONSUMATE ACTOR AND A LOVELY AND GRACIOUS HUMAN BEING!!
Are y'all deleting comments? How has no one noticed Margot dominated this interview, and Cillian's basically interviewing her?
Cillian Murphy is a treasure, he can play such strong, intense characters, and when he's not working, he's like a cute little bunny you want to protect!!
1st time I've seen Cillian laughing and relaxing during a press tour!!
I hope Cillian wins an oscar. I wanna see what he says on the podium hahaha he is going to suffer so much having all that attention and praise its gonna be hilarious!!
great content, thanks
Hope they both work together soon, like maybe in a Barbie sequel with him and Timothée Chalamet as new Kens, and maybe, what about in a new Barbenheimer movie? Imagine if that movie gets distributed by both Universal Pictures & Warner Bros. Pictures!!
Most people see Oppenheimer and Barbie, but I see the Scarecrow and Harley Quinn!!
She takes over too much. He's much more interesting
Epic
Margot is surely one of us when she fangirl so hard on Peaky Blinders.
"Well, likewise" He has not seen a single Margot movie other than Barbie LMAO
Thomas slebew🥶🥶🥶
Cillian so handsome
Keep making weekly episodes with them plzzzzz
His voice is like honey in the ear, so soothing and mesmerizing. They had a truly interesting conversation that didn't feel forced
Its amazing that the lead actors of the most two succesfull movies in this summer, doesnt know any rivalry. And what a respectfull conversation that was. I saw Barbie and Oppenheimer, both Films are good. Oppenheimer is a masterpiece. The success from Oppenheimer proofs, that the audience like cinema and original Films. And not always Sequels, Prequels, Remakes or Prequels from Remakes and so on. Please Hollywood stop your crisis of creativity and gives us more films like Barbie or Oppenheimer. You can challenge the audience.
ITS BARBENHEIMER
My new favorite actors on actors video 🥰
I hate that she talked more then him, every story he had she had to interrupt with her own. Love her still tho
Most needed actors on actors this year!!!
🖤💗
this is the best video i've ever seen> margot robbie is the best xoxo love from yousef alhathlool kuwait
So down to earth and humble i love this conversation
He has a wonderful voice that I could stare into for hours.
What a rich conversation between them!
Margot is the president of the Peaky Blinders club 😂
Margot the human Barbie and the leader of the documentary they keep debating which one is better
I like how she described exactly why the shitty writers are shitty. 😂
Two gentle and poised people...I like the aura emanating from them :)
Brilliant commentary on their level of preparation freeing them up to actually give their best performance once it’s time to go
The fact that they wore black and pink depicting the themes of both the movies. ✨
2 queens maximizing their joint slay
I have no idea who is Greta grewich I only know the best super guy ever Christopher Nolan
I LOVE THESE TWO SO MUCH THANK U FOR PUTTING THEM TOGETHER I NEVER KNEW I NEEDED THIS :'D
Hi Barbie is just like hail Hitler on jojo rabbit same energy
Barbie foi um ótimo marketing para a mattel, ninguém apostou que eles levariam para esse lado
Finally Barbenheimer
Two fantastic actor's. All I can say is I hope they get to be in a good movie together. I'm sure it would be a great success! They are just so good!
Ela extrovertida, ele introvertido kkk amo os dois ❤
Love them, love them ❤
Picked the most 2 interesting actors 😭
They are also dressed like Oppenheimer vs Barbie 😂❤
"yeah, yeah, yeah" 😂
simply peak
28:56 they smiling gave me 1000 years of life, wow
Sublime
This interview is like a big christmas gift....thank you so much !!!
Cillian is old now woah
Thank you so much for this! Already watched 3 times 🙈👌🏽
harley quinn 🤝🏻 scarecrow (a.k.a gotham city’s villains)
when Cillian mentioned Lisa O’Neil, Irish proud 🥹
4 days 4 million views. Their power 💥
Barbenheimer was an amazing event of the cinema's history that me personally will never forget about it.
Man I love these two.
"they write themselves into corners and then out of corners." Oh, a lot about this movie is making sense now. haha
🥰Cillian🤩
Loved oppenheimer, barbie not so much..So it goes..I'm a poet and lean towards the serious
Barbie was a terrible movie
love it
The Scarecrow and Harley, owning the summer helmed by two great minds...ya love to see it.
Barbenheimer in our hearts💖
PEAKY BLINDERS MOVIE PLEASE
A true meeting of the acting heavyweights. The acting version of Ali v foreman! But in a very friendly way of course.
Oppenheimer was a better film. Liked the sarcasm in Barbie doe
Cillian be like on Wednesday’s we wear black lol
Did you notice how two great actors are listening , asking and repeat. The most basic skill required to be a performer. To be able to listen.
31:30 i need to know the name of that "this american life" episode
Love them!❤
Wow! Starstruck is an understatement.
Cillian is such an old soul, like he was pulled from the 1800s. The interview feels like a father having a sit down conversation with his long lost daughter. lol.
First day I watched Oppenheimer, the second Barbie - it was a great decision. Oppie shake me, Barbie did the rest
She is quite beautiful and smart
9:38
Such an awkward interview. Awful pairing.
the noise reduction and noise gate is too harsh on their voices
SNEAKING picky blinders in the interview i love her ahahaha
9:41 Margot got a great sense of humor , that was a good joke lol
This was lovely
43:13 best part of the video.
“Hopefully not for the last time”
Just what I want to watch
The world is very grateful for Barbenheimer!
my literal father
Margot interrupting him
These are both brilliant human beings and actors, but this discussion is so boring
Gerwig and Nolan- please write movies that pairs these two.
They rocket my 2023 🔥 Margot is so beautiful 🙊 Cillian is beautiful 🙊 Movie stars to the maximum lol
Tommy Shelby and Harley Quinn interviewing each other
Why is Cillian speaking in this weird pseudo American accent? Especially when Margot is just speaking in her own Aussie accent!
She is beautiful my word
They should do a movie together they are definitely as good as her and Leo
Bro if Margot asked me to do anything like she asked him to make a Peaky movie, I'd die
please do a barbieheimer movie
Tommy “ fuckin “ Shelby
Margot looks so beautiful and cillian is charming as ever!
The ending was kind of flirty, just saying.
Can Cilian talk about his film please? 😬
Bro gives the driest replies
may i say that i shipped them so much?
What i noticed is when margot started to speak cillian was listening carefully, but when cillian started talking Margot was interrupting she's so excited to speak  In real life im like margot and i always aspire to act like cillian in such situations 🤍
cut the crap, Barbie is an insult to our brains
44:20 what do you mean by no story to tell , " HE'S BACK - BACK FROM UNDER THE GROUND "
i love this so much i wish it was longer
This is great!!!
movie name?
As soon as i saw them in reel i RAN here!! This is sooo refreshing and exciting ✨✨✨
Cillian is so cool ❤
Let there be a Peaky Blinders movie and take these 2 as leads❤.
Fun fact: Cillian Murphy auditioned for the role of Ken.
I don't know anything she say about Barbara 😂
This is one of the best interviews I've ever seen of actors, it's so interesting watching them bounce ideas off each other based on their experiences, definitely better than the standard interviewer with the same 10 questions that are always asked
When this girl is gonna shut up?
This interview is one of the best of actors on actors !!!  I love hw they are so different and so professional,  the conversation were so good , so intersting so likable , yo can feel how a New friendship and respect was born.
Legendary!❤
How can they say audiences don’t like being told what to see or that audiences just chose this when marketing budget for Barbie was higher than the movie
"this is true."
Bro please make Peaky Blinders Season 7 we are all wont it 🔥
43:10❤
Damn...so it was all part of the plan!
The duo we never know we needed
The most iconic actors of the year
😍😍😍😍
Feeling ugly in every langauge
Me encanto
I really like the part where they talked about valuing handwritten letters and writing letters to people they want to work with.   Despite their clear difference in personalities, I think they have quite a bit in common when it comes to their working styles, handwritten letters to their peers, style of prep work etc. They understand each other because they belong to the same craft. A reporter might not have the same knowledge therefore might not connect with the actor they are interviewing.    Also, 4 million views in 3 days? Holy shit. They really are the moment.
Extrovert Margot, meet introvert Cillian. I’ve always loved Cillian and had so much respect for him as a person and an actor! I had no idea Margot possessed such depth and intelligence. Both actors are our most prominent talents in the now.
loved how margot just go   off topic and start talking about peaky blinders😂
Usually these collegiate conversations between actors are painful and mawkish... These two were pretty balanced without being affectat(ious)...
Barbenheimer😂
damn you Margot. She literally wore a pink outfit 😂😂
They should’ve done this interview in their character costumes 😂
BLACKPINK!
WE NEEDED THESE 2 TOGHETER. last summer i absolutely hyperfixated on Barbenheimer, AND NOW THEY R TOGHETER!!!!!
Margot and Cillian should do a movie together
this was a great interview.......so....Cillian and Margot movie when?
Just two legends have a lil chat 🙌
My favourite celebrities Margot and Cillian they need to work together
Who gives a fuck
love how they understand each other so well as two amazing, famous actors
Introvert extrovert friendship be like
He's such a treat to watch ❤
bro forgot his original accent after speaking american for all that time
I don't know how barbie is compared to openheimer, barbie was a complete meme itself - no actual value made for halfwits (from the script to the conversations - it hurt my brain to watch it, I truly felt duller after it) something that can be done only in america - the dumbest of nations
Cilian always a Sigma
43:31 "tommy f*cking shelby" 🥵 ikr
BARBENHEIMER
Can i just say. The fact that Cillian wears all Black and Margot is almost fully Pink it does something special for me atleast
It was really interesting to hear them talk about the similarities between Nolan and Gerwig. Plus, their discussion on prepping for parts, they are similar in their dedication 🤩
honestly i thought this episode could have been more interesting but turns out it isn't
I find Cillian such a handsome face. I loved him in Inception.
43:10
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
This interview was such a fresh breath of air 🥹🌟
Yes .. .. .. Yes... .. Yes
Cillian is so hot! What a guy. What a smile.🥰
YouTube comments are just Npcs glazing now it’s crazy
Bet he wanted her to play Grace for those “scenes”
Me encanto la química entre estos dos, en lo personal soy fan de ambos, me hubiera gustado que Margot no interrumpiera tanto a Cillian, creo que la conversación pudo ser más interesante
Margot comes across as an asshole here.
Can someone put this duo together in the movie as main characters, pleaseeee.
43:13 peaky blinders
It brought so much joy to watch these two discovering each other’s role. So natural and calm energy. And it’s so amazing to see them being engaged to their characters
Як і в кінотеатрі 21-го: від Марго багато тексту, зайняла весь простір, а глубини ніякої. Роббі задає такі цікаві питання Кіліану і тут же перетягує ковдру на себе. Я хотіла почути більше від Кіліана про все, про що він починав говорити. Ось там була істина, яку ми не почули. Шкода, що так побудувалась розмова. Марго слідувало давати людям більше простору.
What is an animal work??? 🥴
I want to see these two in a movie
Vicky kaushal is the Cillian Murphy of Bollywood
Shit i was clickbaited.....i thought this is "actors on actors".....😢
Existem brasileiros que querem legenda em Português.
Harley Quinn and the Scarecrow in an alternate universe...
I love how intently Cillian is listening
MARGOT DESERVES ALL OF THIS!
IT'S BARBENHEIMER!
BARBENHEIMER TAKING OVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Peaky blinders timestamp please
I LOVE MARGOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
the literal BARBIEHEINMER
My two favorite actors in one video?? YES PLEASE?!
Finally  Barbie and Oppenheimer got together!!
Every time I see Cillian I just see Thomas Shelby.
43:12
Cilian doesn’t want to be there
It feels so good to see a full-length-conversational-interview being given by Cilian. Could totally relate with Margot when she started talking and asking questions about Peaky Blinders
Thomas shelby tried his best to act like cilian murphy
Best ❤❤❤❤ Made me a fan of this channel 😁😁😁😁
Oppenheimer and barbie in the same room LOL
Listening to Margot talk about working on the movie, I have so much respect for Greta's process. She has a vision and she gets everyone to buy in to it. Having movie church sounds awesome to be able to watch something with a whole room of movie nerds and talk about how it relates to barbie. The daily dance parties to really live out and experience barbieland. Greta is a top notch director and leader.
Who skipped margot and went for Cilians interview directly?
Margot is a world class manifester!
I love both of them, but omg, let Cillian speak 😭😭😭😭😭
peaky blinders part: 43:13
Just the best two ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Barbenheimer amazing🙌👏
These two could make an especially evil  pair in a movie and not a superhero movie . Just two really dark, hilariously slanted killers on a roll. Like a brother, sister pair of murderers reaping vengeance on those foolish enough to come across their path. You give Cillian and Margo a great script and they will deliver a hell of a fine performance. They've proved that numerous times already.
The way murphy say “yeah..”
barbenheimer was on my bday, so to see two of my fav actors having a conversation was amazing. Their voices are both really satisfying
Obsessed with Peaky >>
Cillian is so sexy!
forgot this was The Barbenheimer thing, i click cause cilian murphy in it. i thougth it was kinda random for Murphy and Margot Robbie together.
Cillian is loosing his aussie accent?! 🤔
Cillian like: yeah yeah yeah
How about... just hear me out. We stop giving attention to people paid to lie to you?
This is the exact perfect time for this conversation!
Now I need a Cilian-Margot film where they are archenemies lol
43:14 peaky blinders
Where is the brazilian portuguese subtitles 😢
Nice
Celebrities life ..wow
Nobody can argue about Margot’s beauty. It’s from another planet.
Now i want him with Gosling
If pickey blinders make a movie, i hope margot play in the movie
Can we take a moment to appreciate that the producers even matched the microphones to the outfits? 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
I quite enjoyed this conversation, whoever put them together is a genius.
Peaky blinders finale spoiler sucked actually
43:16 this is what you are looking for
I wasn't when Barbie becomes human... Today I learned the usefulness of the word "must". Humans must follow JesusChrist. Stay Barbie. Learn from Mommy, she fucs with many of them but she has knowledge, I love so much that old Dolly... She thinks that she is a doll useful for package bars of chocolate. And I trying so hard to transform her, I am telling her: You are not useful and that's it. You have meaningful depth. I tried but now I have to deal with industrial Disney. Now I have to redesign Star Wars and Marvel for free. Because of my panamanian usefulness. God Dickens and his bitumen. Greta Garbo.
Barbie was horrible.
the outcome of this video only makes me appreciate actors, directors, costume designers, cinematographers, and everyone in the film industry even more
I saw Cillian Murphy in the movies On the Edge (2001), Breakfast on Pluto (2005), and The Wind That Shakes The Barley (2006), and his acting was mesmerizing to me. I think On the Edge was the first time I saw him, but I'm unsure. I knew he would continue to be a fantastic actor. Then I saw him again in a few more movies and Peaky Blinders... Wow! I am not a huge fan of crime and mafia series and movies, but he (and the rest of the cast) drew me in, and I enjoyed the series tremendously. I'll watch Oppenheimer soon! I can't wait. I love Margot Robbie too, of course. I want to watch everything she's done.
Margot and Cillian are like sugar and coffee. A wonderful blend
Нет слов, просто потрясающе
Wer merkt auch das sie aufgeregt ist sie hat kaum Luft beim Atmen merkt ihr das auch oder bilde ich mir was vor ? Aber natürlich Respekt und ich will sie nicht verurteilen aber kann ja sein das sie auf unseren Tommy shelby steht 👀😁
fucking love'em
Jawlines battle ❤️‍🔥
omg this was soooo nice and chill?
Cillian!!!! <3
This the shit u see in da movies
❤❤❤❤❤
She can't stop talking even when he is supposed to answer one of her questions...
I sooo love cillian murphy 🥹
Did Margot put Greta Gerwig in the same league as Christopher fucking Nolan?
The best interview at I ever seen in my life. Two GOATs men!! 🐐
كيليان : انا ايه الي جابني هنا
this is so cool
Margot Robbie is the biggest star of her generation
Narcissists on narcissists 😎
This is blatant false adverstising! actors on actors I wanna see the sexy time version of Cillian and Margot.
Two beautiful humans
Margot is a masterclass on how to combine beauty and brains, her insights on being a producer are so interesting as she was involved in the entire process from day one.
Ok they need to do a movie together! The chemistry!!!
margot asked such great questions
Cillian doesn't look like he hates life in this. How delightful it is to see him smile and laugh through the conversation. He initiated this pairing and wanted to be there, please give him more chances to make his own choices. The result is seeing him truly happy to engage with someone.
26:54 dis is where I left off I’m going sleep 😂
Margot is so smart
omg thank you for this!
The one super random thing was Margot mentioning the difference in mouth space in Americans and Australians. I was so confused because theyre both melting pot countries...sooo I - like im confused lol.  Maybe its based on commonality i guess. lol
Cillian has been one of my favourite actors since I saw him playing Jim on Boyle’s 28 Days Later. He has always been so captivating to me. Lovely to see him talking so freely and calmly to such an intelligent, nerdy and talented actress. Margot is a truly movie buff, and we can see and appreciate that! Honestly I usually find these actors on actors interviews so boring, but this one was pretty special. Thanks for doing and sharing this ❤
Did they really have to do those silly accents for the entire interview? Just talk normal.
Cillian‘s persona, accent and talent are just all around TOP NOTCH. UP the Irish ☘️
7:53 Cillian almost it best: we have an appetite for GOOD cinema.
La amooooo
Another  18 months and she'll be a nobody.
Best looking person alive…ohh and Margot Robbie’s there too
The duo we badly needed
Margo: lm bar................................. cilian: ah  Margo: u perf................................... Cilian : oh  Margo: acti....................................... Cilian: yeh  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
it must be very hard for Chillian to act all the time.
This movie was a victory for marketing and Margot's screen appeal and not much more. Great format interview having star on star.
Margot is a real life Barbie, i tried to think of someone other than her playing Barbie but literally she is the only actress I can think of that resembles a doll so muchhh AND she's so smart and so talented
Margot: Hi!! Cillian: Yeah.
Cillian legend ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Such a fun interview to watch. Love them both.
mogged
I love Margot and I love Cillian, but in my opinion barbie was not good. I mean Margot was perfect and the entire production was incredible in terms of customs, music and cinematography, but the script was very, very weak. I know it is intended for young audiences (I'm young myself), but it was so shallow, basic and not interesting. The messages they tried to communicate does not make any sense and are very problematic. I'm not judging anyone who enjoyed the movie of course.
Yeah, that was good!
You all see Oppenheimer and Barbie talking. I only see Scarecrow and Harley plotting against Batman...
Margot is so full of herself and her stupid film. Let the legend talk girl.
just shut each other up and start making out on the sofas guys.
This is my roman empire
Barbiehamer, yeah!
There is zero chemistry here. This interview has all the sparkle of when Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp were paired up in The Tourist. Two great performers that do not work well together.
This video is a blessing.
These two needed to be in a movie together ♥️
Smells like desperation 🏆
i could listen to Cillian Murphy talk about anything. Dude is so compelling.
OMG MARGOT LET CILLIAN TALK PLEASE HE BARELY TALKS
Margot seems so fake, her reactions are a bit overreact hurts my eyes
This is so lovely, absolutely brilliant! These are two of my absolute favorite actors, two of the best in the industry - this was amazing  - thank you Vanity Fair 👏🏾❤️👍🏾
shes so beautiful inside and out
Both cheekbones and intelligence in this video is off the charts 🤯
I didnt realise margot robbie was so intelligent
BARBENHEIMER
mogged
I didn't sneeze but they both blessed me
Two biggest movies this year that brought back the excitement that people used to have about movies back in the day
this is such an amazing and genius pairing, you can truly feel the love they have for movies and the respect that they have for each other, it was particularly really funny seeing Margot Robbie talk about her love for Peaky Blinders lol
such a lovely conversation.
Lets all agree that most things don't need a sequel, please. Ang if it could have a sequel doesn't need to be rushed .
Loved this. Thanks, Variety.
About the overall mood on set and the movie as mentionned at 24:00, as someone who has worked on the visual effects for this movie, I can confirm that this upbeat/having a good time vibe was definitely something we had on the visual effect side of the movie too, one of the best team I've worked with just because of the overall mood ! And it really reflected through the movie too ! props to everyone in the team for that :)
Cillian is good listener 😂
pure good content. loved hearing about the craft behind their acting.
This girl is pretty in such way that it becomes annoying
I loved this, what a great conversation between two total professionals
I am dying of how sweet and excited Margot is because she is Cillian's fan and he is so calm and sweet too specially at the end😂
Does no one else feel like this is a dream? It always felt like they were two whole separate things, or existed in alternate dimensions, that only fans brought together. Each of them being aware of the other's existence, let alone being in the same room, feels surreal.
Cillian smiled and laughed so much in this than entire season of peaky blinders and Oppenheimer combine😅😅
43:12 is when she talks of Peaky Blinders, for those of you who came for that (like me)
Well… somebodys got a crush on somebody lol 😂❤. Love them both so much. Thanks for this great inteview!
Oh how i loved this conversation ❤️ so insightful
hey barbie ❤
openhiammer and Barbie
Now we need Godzilla being the interviewer
Loving vlogmas I love seeing you as happy as you are!!!!!!!
Oh Mr.Murphy those eyes!!! Sigh.
Потрясающие! Мечтаю об их кинодуэте))
Thank you Variety for doing us this favour
Ophenbarbie vs Barbenhiemer
I wish for all the interviewers to be like Cillian hahah I love him! great convo here.
I like the fact a lot that both of them wrote letters to their favorite directors in the past (around minute 16). Edward Norton said too that he wrote a letter to Wes Anderson, and that this is how he got the role in Moonrise Kingdom. Just a really nice touch that in the end even solid and established actors do this just because they love making movies and want to work in good projects alongside and with inspiring people. And it is also a nice touch that they are candid about writing letters and do not hide the fact that they reach(ed) out actively.
Barbenheimer timing up
If I could sit at a dinner table with Cillian and Margot and have a conversation like this my mind would explode.
Margot, could you please let him talk?😅
Hopefully in the future we could get all 4 Margo, Cilian , Greta and Nolan together in a movie.
This interview and conversation feel like a meditation tool
I love her
i love cillian just because he one of few actor that act like his age. i mean many actors that in their 40s but still act like 20s
Ditunggu duet project bareng nya hehe
Margot Robbie is so lovely! Her loving the fact that it's normal to wear masks so a celebrity like her can walk in the world without turning heads is so cute, i wonder what shenanigans she was up to in this post-pandemic
Greta Gerwig, please invite me to Movie Church.
man!! he is controlling that shelby so good.... thomas foooooking shelby
OMG
I'm sorry but I'm here to see is Cillian Murphy is gonna make disapointement face...
The two most mainstream actors at the moment ❤️ I love them
i wish i was not short and ugly. it was my dream to be an amazing actor
how can someone look beautiful and handsome at the same time
I wonder if Cillian's son saw this comment
I love him so much
She is so pretty.
So happy I was able to enjoy both movies in theaters ❤ it was amazing to witness such impact on the history of cinema in our era
ما احب الستريت بس شبكتهم 💅🏽
another good video to watch while eating
Why is it so surprising to see the Scarecrow and Harley Quinn together, when they practically belong together? Jokes aside, this whole interview was refreshing, great pairing
All of us have unconsciously manifested this…. 😅😮
I sure hope LuckyChap has or finds a project for these two to collaborate on.
this is the real girl dinner
cillian is part time cillian and full time  Tommy
Barbie was the most boring movie that a ever whatched
Barbenheimer canon
who is this cillian guy ? look exactly like thomas shelby
The appetite the audience has for navel gazing about the 1950s/60s.
She interrupts him all the time 😫
the part about them dancing during the production of Barbie and the Fast X ppl stopped by feels like in Toy Story when they visited the Barbie aisle and were stopping in on all the Barbies dancing
Really interesting interview 🖤
Incredible interview
I just loved how this interview felt like a natural conversation and I'm looking forward to the next ones! Margot and Cillian stole the show this year
watching margot in so many movies where she has an american accent it's so weird hearing her actual accent. It feels like she's acting right now haha
Bruh she interrupted him too much
These two are so charming omg
Mission Impossible watching this from afar.
I enjoyed this immensely ❤
Millions of views in only two days. Hopefully they will get a fantastic script they can do together in the future.🤞
WHAATTT CILLIAN ON CALM APP??? WHY DIDNT I KNOW THAT ALL THIS TIMEEE
I believe Margot brings that out of people , a likable personality , I’ve seen her engage with other Actors if it’s fake she the greatest Actress in the world
"i was unemployed, i'd just finished something." yeh, just finished the last season of playing Tommy Shelby, the greatest character in british tv history.
Un gran reportaje, es difícil ver a Cilian relajado cómodo y entretenido…!! Él pasó a ser mi actor preferido después de Peaky B. Yo era fan de Margot pero cuando me enteré que era amiga de Amber Herd ex Jhonny Deep la miró con desconfianza……
They should make a movie together They have very good chemistry
Alpha silver back male gorilla pairs with queen 👸 lioness of the serengati What kind of beautiful weans would there produce. Irish dna v antipoden beauty.SOME MIX OF TALENT/BEAUTY. 2 MASTER RACES!!
Thank god Amy Schumer left the barbie production
Just two future Oscar winners face to face, enjoying each others’ presence 🙏
reminds me so much of Murphy’s interviews with his friend Jamie Dornan. He has this cat 🐈 like vibe while Margot has golden retriever energy. they’ve got good chemistry 🧪
can somebody please gimme a map? i just lost in cillian's eyes
i love this longform content,, usually actor interviews are 5-10 mins long if that? really appreciating it
I must be the only person on earth who has not watched either of these, but doesn't hate these people lol
this is the longest that ive seen cillian murphy in an interview
Well folks when are the Scarecrow talking to Harley memes coming out?
The amount of “yeah” in this video is crazy 😂
i think they are have the most beautiful eyes in the world
43:24 Cillian's casual chuckle is a whole sexuality in itself.
Damn
I could watch them both talk the whole day.
Barbenheimer really took over 2023
Wow
LOVED IT SO MUCH
both of these movies felt like a play being filmed
yah! I am now watching peaky blinders for the third time.
I was about to search this after seeing an fb post, saw first on recommendations. What a miracle
The Oppenbarbie
Two passionate actors talking about what they love and the wholeprocess behind it. Loved the interview and the energy in it.
Ест тут узбеки
Want to watch them in a movie together, a delight to just watch them in the same frame.
Cillian has become one of my favorite actors hes phenomenal
Best 2 actors ❤
her beauty 🥰🥰
Unpopular opinion from a huge Cillian fan: she never let him speak! Constantly interrupting talking about herself ahhhhhh 🤕🤕🤕🤕
Why is she interrupting him constantly? Let him finish what he’s saying!
lol, plenty of people can introspect without having an internal monologue
this saved my 2023
Really good interviews. Hope one day they work together. I would like to see him in a romantic movie.
Just one Batman movie to bring Scarecrow together with Harley Queen!! kkkkkkk
Who wrote the dialog ? 😂 Are they thinking by themselves really ? Where the script ?
damn make part 2
I am so sorry she was the one chosen to speak with him. She interrupts very 10 seconds and just talk  about she thought and wow, like, yeah. Let him speak!!!!!!!!!!
Seeing such talented people talk about how much prep they do for their roles is quite humbling.
We want a Tom Cruise and Keanu Reeves interview
What an amazing conversation!
TWO LEGENDS
Two soulless puppets
Margot Robbie fangirling in the end is just so wholesome
i so badly wanna see them work together
Does anyone know the episode of this american life podcast that Margot is referring to?
Cillian always has this face that screems "I don't want to be here!" Even in this video where he is literally talking to world's most beautiful woman he looks as if he would rather be anywhere else! 🤣
No way they did this 🖤💖
this woman has no sign of intelligence . She´s just lousy business. How embarrassing it might have been wasting time talking to her Cillian would say
Omg I love “All the tired horses” at the end of Peaky. Lisa’s cover was so good. When I heard that from Margot it spoke to my soul. I constantly listen to that song now with so much meaning.
it’s so obvious that Margot Robbie is a skilled film nerd and i couldn’t love her more
Season 7 when?
BARBENHEIMER!
greta not showing ppl the script seems like a recipe for the film not being as good as it could have been, pretty much everyone needs input and corrections from others
I know in this videos actors are always promoting movies, but Margot seems to be in a heavy PR mode, probably because she is thr producer also.
I LOVE margot robbie ❤❤❤❤she is perfect . Sooo beautiful 🌹
23:45 lmao margot robbie not knowing that kind of movie is gold.
The joy Margot shows while taking about peaky blinders 💯 like a true fangirl
Next   Rachel Zegler and Halle Bailey on The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes and The Little Mermaid (Live Action)
This interview is so real , I don’t see even 1 minute fake in it
Cillian Murphy❤is  Best
Olly London
We're not gona be friends
Margot is just as charming as barbie, I could listen to her talk all day😍It can be clearly seen the how much effort nolan, greta and all the actors put to make barbieheimer a culture phenomena  and Cilian Murphy, it'd be the biggest tragedy if he doesn't get an Oscar next year , his name is written on it
I love how they match their mic with their outfit🥺 Cillian with his black mic, Margot with her white mic🖤🤍
my roman empire
I have an exam tomorrow but i can't miss Margot and Cillian having a chat 😭❤️
I love hearing Margot talk!! I swear, the way she has this self-confidence, but not in an obnoxious way, but more in this smart-empowering way, is so cool and inspiring.
I always thought that to really appreciate how good an actor/actress is, you should watch some interviews with him/her, to see how they are in real life. The facial expression, gestures, accent, tone, the way they speak. And after watching this I've found new respect for Cillian Murpy, you can tell that in all these movies, he's really acting, he's a different person on daily basis. And that's what acting should be about, to lose as much of yourself as possible, and to fully turn into the character your playing.
Whoever waiting for peaky blinders fan moment go forward to 42min
💗💗Cargot Mobbie! 💗💗
For me, the best part of this great interview, it starts at 43:13
Barbenheimer interview yessss
Six seasons and a movie
bring ryan
"Audiences don't like being told 'you should see this or you should see that'. They will decide and they will generate the interest themselves." - such a brilliant quote
Who just came here to find the sequence about PB and Thomas f*ckin Shelby rais his hand?!! 43:34 dont Thank me
Okay now do Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt
i love this
Oh god it's Cillian 😍😍😍
Will he ever grow old ❤️🤌🤩
She talks too much
Cilian rocks man. . . Doesn't seem pr trained and thank god. Margot seems pr trained but that's aite too i suppose
You can tell Cillian is hating every second of doing this.
We need a movie with these two. Cmon Margot. Make it happen.
Variety putting their photo as their channel banner is so wholesome
Margot : we would have dance parties in the morning and have so much fun!! And all the sets were hand made   Cillian: wow that must be wonderful!! Nolan expected perfection as soon as you got on set, and… we worked outside, sometimes even at Oppenheimer’s house.   Both productions are beautiful. Two different films with two different worlds. Fascinating.
Ahhh, love these two ❤❤❤
I have been a huge fan of Cillian since he was in 28 Days Later, Red Eye and a personal favourite Sunshine. He has been my go to. If he's in a movie, I know its going to be enjoyable. His growing success is so satisfying to watch. He has deserved this exposure for a very long time and I hope he gets an Oscar.
Cillian? More like Chillian. Got em.
Love his Cork accent
I love how Margot is a talented, incredible and serious actor but also every bit of a clued up millennial, fangirling so damn hard for Cilian, who he’s worked with and just the movie industry in general. What a queen.
People are everything, people are weird <333 so relateable
I love the Actors on Actors series (and Directors on Directors).  This was so interesting & lovely to watch.  Two extraordinarily talented people.  Margot Robbie just always seems effervescent whereas Cillian usually seems as if he'd rather be anywhere else:) so it was great to see him relaxed and engaged and enjoying himself.  Great pairing.
For her categorisation of the two kinds of people in the world by PB, Maggot Robbie you surely have won my love. 💞💞
they look so good
Oiii!!  -thomas shelby
By the order of the FUCKINGG PEAKYY BLINDERS
Thank you Cillian and Margot. And everyone involved with these gorgeous films. Just thanks.
10:13 Bro was faster than Eminem
Barbenheimer 😍😍
such a great convo
So Thomas Shelby causally talks with Harley Quinn about Openheimer and Barbie, just great!
MUST WATCH VIDEO
Barbie’s mind blown? Idk
Margot is so gen z lmao and he so boomer
Acting? What is that
Absolutely love them both. I did feel like Margot interrupted Cillian quite a bit, in a very polite way nonetheless 😆💕
Cillian eyes shine more brightly when Margo ones, amusingly
This interview felt so much less than 50 minutes
Put them in a movie together. It is time
Tommy !!
wait
Palestine will be FREE 🍉 🇵🇸🍉🇵🇸🍉
Free Palestine 🇵🇸 ❤️ 🇴🇲
fun fact everybody is talking about cillian murphy
Me senti representada pela Margot , também sou uma grande fã do Cillian 🤗❤️
Omg so wholesome
Is it me or she is talking too much ?
i love this pair !!
I love this
Cillian=goat
Come on Cillian reprise your role as Jim and do another 28 days later with Danny Boyle .
This was both the most anticipated and boring Actors on Actors ever.
Only clicked cause margot looked so good In the thumbnail
Thomas Shelby meets Harley Quinn
Love hearing the innerworkings of good actors. I wasn't interested in either one of these films and didn't see them but I like both of these actors and this was very cool to listen in on.
Can belive cillain is 47😲
Now they have to make a spin off of “The peaky blinders” and put Margot in it too😌❤️
I just love the subtlety of their accents. Cillian with his Irish accent and Margot with Australian. But both are mixed with American accents as well.
I understand expecting the next Nolan movie but he expects the next greta movie?
I love Cillian so much!!!!
Cillian você é muito especial para nós ❤️❤️
This interview is such a treat… simply brilliant mash-up that I’m so grateful for ❤ And both of them are so genuine and deeply talented while remaining humble as well… so much respect for the prep process that they both explain so freely… and also for the producers of this series… thank you!
You have to change the thumbnail
Great interview. It shows you how professional these people are.
they should do a mini show like oppenheimer and barbie meeting each other lmao
cillian sometimes probably felt like talking with a teenager or a huge fan AND I LOVE MARGOT FOR THIS
It's like watching Dr Crane and Dr Quinzel having their own therapy sessions turned into geeking over one another's work.
Cillian es tan hermoso, amo como actúa tan natural todo el tiempo ❤y en una entrevista tan larga verlo interactuar es tan lindooooo❤❤❤😊😊😊muy pocas veces se puede ver así 🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹
Margot talking at Cillian for 50 minutes. Not a dig on her, he’s just really boring honestly. Great actor though
I'm gonna tell my kids Barbenheimer was the biggest event in the past 2000 years.
Cillian wearing black and Margot wearing pink is just the cherry on top
Que bellos ❤
An interview worthy of Barbenheimer 🩷🖤
I want both of them in a movie ❤
alby james kitchins sent me here
Christopher Nolan and Cillian Murphy: the greatest British and Irish Duo to ever exist
I need an unedited full cut part two of this because WHAT
can't get enough of Margot fangirling about Peaky Blinders lol
Margo Robbie tells u to make a peaky blinders movie. You do it! 😆😎
Diosss, adoro a Margot pero por favor deja hablar a Murphy, no todo se trata de ella, no paraba de interrumpir y ni siquiera lo dejaba terminar de responder.
I need to meet both of them pls😭
want them together in new movie! ❤
More of this Variety! Please!
In the holy bible in jeremiah‬ chapter 29 verse 11‬ king james version it says [11] For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end. God bless everyone Jesus loves you and i love you
I hope the person that started barbenheimer gets payed😭
I didn't realize I was waiting for this combination so bad before I spotted this clip
Ach ya est der Barbenheimer
She needs to let him talk and answer her questions Jesus lmao
Tommy❤❤
I so freaking love Cillian! Been a fan of his since, “28 Days Later”! I’ve seen everything he’s done! He never misses! Such a talent!!🥰🥰🥰. On the other hand, I still haven’t seen, “Barbie”….😂
I didn't know that tommy shelby knew barbie
There’s a reason both of them are stars - you can’t take your eyes off of either of them.
They didn't step out of their roles.
best video everrr
I absolutely love how Margot is so excited while talking to Cillian about his role in Peaky Blinders. She looks like any other fan when meeting one of their favourite characters.
Hopefully they act together at some point
Time is running out be ready. DNA is called the intelligent book of life for every living thing. Intelligent information tells us there must be an intelligent designer. I am the way, truth & life no one comes to the Father (God) except through Me (Jesus).John 14:6 Please repent/believe.
One of the best thing that happened in the film industry, breaking records and setting bars.
She's a huge fan of his and she can't hide it. It almost feels like she's star-struck haha
Love Margot. I’m the cool gay uncle in the family.  Me and my niece play ps5 fornite teams. We live an hour apart so it’s over the the magic of internet. We’re both Harley Quinn in different outfits and twin sisters kicking ass together in the the game. So much fun. She always jokes this is your only chance to be a girl 😂😂😂. I say if I wanted to be a girl it would definitely be that one. She’s an only child, no siblings, raised by my parents, with my sister her mother passed, so I step in when I can. She also does portraits of actors and movies she loves. She’s done Margot as Harley Quinn and Emma Stone as Cruella. Both works of art are scary good. I don’t know where talent like that comes from. It’s not traced I’ve seen her draw. It could easily be mistaken as a poster just printed off google. But in Pensil form.
♡♡♡
As someone who went to the theater liking both of these actors and proceeding to enjoy both, this interview/conversation makes it all 10x better. Love how humble they both are and how they both are able to find common ground and respect one another.
ÔKOK
Will she LET Cillian FINISH a QUESTION ??? I get she’s a fan girl - but cmonnn we wanna hear the Amman speak ffs
In love with this video
Huge respect to Margot Robbie... Well spoken, great sense of humor, extremely beautiful and such a great actress.  Cillian is... Cillian... Extraordinaire in every aspect!
I loved everything about this discussion sat through it the whole way but I am not gonna lie Peaky Blinders was on my mind in the back the whole time and I loved that Margot asked about it at the end
Literally the perfect pairing for 2023
Fantastic sit down. I could listen to them talk all day.
Wow. Brilliant idea to have these two talk to each other on their movies. Would be great to maybe see them on screen in a film together!
God, Cillian's cheekbones are to die for! I can get lost in those blue eyes.
This conversation was amazing!!!🎉
Love it!!!!!!!!!!
The people on that set must’ve been in love with them both talking so candidly 😂😂😂🩷
Round 1: FIGHT !
AMAZING!!! 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
I love that Margot is a fan of Peaky Blinders. I was squealing simultaneously with her. Same girl same 😂
This is my multiverse of madness-
i forgot they both had accents
Now I need to see them together in a movie
Introvert vs extrovert....notice how Cillian never interrupts and how careful he choses his word. Love Margot😊 she's like the typical extrovert. Notice how often she uses the word "I " and compare it to Cillian. As an introvert watching this got my heart rate up cause I know how it feels to talk to them and my mind races everytime someone interrupts me. But the two of them vibe somehow. It's interesting to watch. 😊
The duo we all needed
hahaha Even she is a fan of Tommy. The most underrated series in history.
By the order of fucking Peaky blinders
I was watching this, and I saw that Margot seemed kind of tense, so I was worried that she was feeling uncomfortable, but then she asked him those questions near the end and revealed herself as a fan and I realized it was just her trying not to fangirl the whole time XD
Ameiiii
It wouldn’t surprise me if these two work together in a movie one day, they have wonderful chemistry ❤
they have just got to do a movie together
Never really paid attention to Margot's feet until barbie. Hell, I can safely say I never paid attention to feet until Barbie.
TOMMY FUKEN SLEBEW . . . best regards from Indonesia ✌️🇮🇩
WHERE ARE YOU
I want to hug them
This perfect they marketers did there job
Technically they are the most famous movie twins
I love him so much
Cillian Murphy: Yeah!
very relaxed interview on interview....not bad at all
I’m not really a guy who watch interviews but I enjoyed so much this one!
Besides all the success the two of them accomplished I want to point out the fact how Margot is always making it clear to the audience what is it that they are talking about; like in min 17:00, she knows what is it to write a script in first person; but she says out loud so the audience will know also and the conversation will be profitable to both fans and cinematographers and producers. Just love it… it’s fascinating the way you guys talk business in a very fun way
LOL... She didn't know shit about that trainwreck of a movie being popular. They forced it to be popular, it had nothing to do with the content of the writing.
Margot Robbie being concerned for Cillian Murphy's lungs is so precious
I know Cillian is a reserved type of guy, but I think this confirms that Margot controls a room when she's in it.  Great interview!
Watched the entire video just to listen to the peaky blinders part
43:15 here it is THOMAS FUCKN SHELBY !!
This was such a fun interview. They have opposite vibes, but managed to have it really work.
Cillian is 100 percent correct that audience are absolutely starving for actual cinema. Like w Barbie people can disagree with shit in it but it’s still a dam well made film. Same exact thing with Oppenheimer like you can not respect the man and hate the weapon or whatever crazy weird takes against there are against it you can’t deny it’s a well made and acted movie.
We need part 2
Margot is GORGEOUS 🩷
So great to hear more about such a great great movie, an instant classic that will be remembered forever..... and the barbie stuff was sorta of interesting too.
Cillian as Tommy Shelby 🥵🥵
Nive
why did they deyassify Margots coat in the thumbnail
These two are fantastic together
F*ck this conversation is amazing
She talks too much
This is Variety’s attempt at redemption after inviting the #GrifterOfMontecito aka #ParkingLotMeg to one of their recent events.
the fact that Margot is Cillian’s biggest fan makes this even better 😂 loved this pairing and this convo
I can't ever remember a double-feature being bigger than Barbenheimer! Can You? It was freaking amazing! My family got wrapped up in it - we saw Barbie and Oppenheimer BOTH on opening day AND this Halloween my husband and daughter were Barbie and Ken and my son and I were Oppenheimer and the Bomb! LOL! I love these two actors as well...I hope they are enjoying their stellar success! xoxo
What does Cillian mean when he says that Nolan has  "HOVs" that he's worked with forever? What's an HOV in this context? Anyone?
I want this to last 3463864 hours
Loveeeee it ❤️❤️❤️❤️ thank you variety for this interview 🫶
Perfect pairing! Love both actors…my favs! To watch them talk about their work, amazing. They have to be two of the most humble actors that work in Hollywood….no bullshit in either of them! I hope that they will work together one day 😊
if only Hollywood would cast more attractive blue-eyed people in films
Cillian Murphy is a true artist, he is true to his craft and a great actor, does his job and goes home at the end of the day kind of a guy.. he seems very humble, calm, soft-spoken and gracious, you don't see movie stars like him very often.
That would be so interesting to have them two in the same movie
Please Dear Lord, let Cillian get an Oscar.
Did she have sexual relations with Will Smith?
heart eyes
So glad Margot brought up Peaky Blinders!
This interview give me butterflies☁️☁️☁️
3 million views in 2 days is incredible
This was absolutely lovely.
Malditos hermosos puta madre 🤩🤩🤩🤩
Wow,  I loved every bit of those 48 minutes! I might sit for another 48 if they agree to do it. This pairing is absolutely PHENOMENAL.
Da best !
Those eyes, those hands, those smiles…✨They are cinematic…🎞
I'm waiting for Ryan and Emma guys
He must panic a little bit when he has to interact with people like her. They couldn't be more opposite.
I know you put these two together on purpose. Well done, very funny meme.
i love cillian's interest about the woman who doesn't introspect. seems like it's his dream:D:D
Man why is the audio so weird
Not the actor on actor action I was hoping for
I want to see Greta Gerwig and Christopher Nolan in such a conversation
adam yaslamis ya😂 margot ilah gibiama yine
Cillian performance in Peaky Blinders is a master pieces.  The only negative is I can't see him in other performances without say well that is Thomas Shelby....
This interview changed my whole outlook on cinema... wow.
I jolted up when Margot started speaking about Peaky Blinders.. omg!! I share Margot's feelings on another peaky blinders season or a spin-off. Cannot get enough of Tommy!  I loved how she said "pleaseee!!"
I WANT MORE PEAKY BLINDERS SEASONS!!!!!!
you’re not fooling anyone, Tommy! Nice try! 😎
They look perfect together. Their dynamic is so different, complementing each other. Hollywood should cast them in a movie together as a couple!
watching Margot totally fan girl over him at the end,,and she asked about Peaky Blinders, omg,,,loved it!
BARBENHEIMER IS PEAK CINEMA
Sound of Freedom though...
Didn't know margot was a big peaky blinders fan🥹. Happy to know that . And freaking yes  we want a movie
36:18 LMAOAOAOAOAOAOA
Oh My Godness, the most GOERGEOUS person ever.   Margot looks nice too.
I never thought about the accent’s  that’s neat
THAT WAS WONDERFUL I could listen to this pair talk for hours on end. Two incredible movies, in their own right.
noo now it looks kinda of official no more peaky fckng blinders😭😭
OMG I LOVET THEM BOTH❤
I VERY MUCH enjoyed this format! I will definitely be watching more of these more candid conversational interviews. These two actors were so lovely! 💖
She's sooooooo gorgeous!!!!!!!!😍😍
watching only for  thomas f,,kig shelby
Great video Barbie definitely took up the whole conversation
Barbie and Oppenheimer finally come together
margot robbie has finally mastered the subtle art of implying that Greta Gerwig is equally "brilliant"....   she really thinks people are always looking forward to next greta gerwig movie...thats pure barbie.
They need a movie together at this point
Cillian is just so HOT ❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥
It is very hard to be an American doing an Australian accent.  The vowels are so twisty.  Interesting that she says  Australians have lazier mouths than ours.  I would have assumed vice versa.  I had no idea that accent training could be so technical, in terms of the structure of the mouth.  It shows how hard actors like Robbie and Murphy work, and make it look easy.
Literally a great pair ❤
Ótimos atores
Looks like Barbenheimer is back on the menu, boys
loved this!
Natural born killers reboot with these two???
It feels so good to see a full-length-conversational-interview being given by Cilian. Could totally relate with Margot when she started talking and asking questions about Peaky Blinders 😅
Barbenheimer: The interview
im swooning rn
I’ve never seen him in anything but he terrifies me 😅
The crossover we all expected to be true AND IT IS NOW
Cillian speaks so calmly  and cool
There's so much knowledge and Substance in this video. This pairing might just be the best. 💯
Two great talented actors 💖 I appreciate the fact that Cillian is asking only questions about Margot's work and experience. No stupid inappropriate questions about her appearance etc.❤❤❤
13:22 👀
I could listen to Cillian talk all day long... what a calm, intelligent and kind man, but of course, I'd rather listen and LOOK at him... God what a man😍
So beautiful 😊. I like this people).
Somebody please bring these two awesome actors together in a movie 😍😍😍
They've both played DC villains too- Scarecrow and Harley Quinn! Just one more thing they have in common.
These two should leave their respective spouses and run away together 😉
His voice is so calming...wish he would do audiobooks
It’s so funny that Chris Nolan doesn’t have a phone but also really makes sense for him
I love 23:41 where Margot is talking about their morning dance parties and how fun it is a Cillian is just like “ahhh..” bc he was in an artistic black hole doing this dark movie (I’ve seen other actors from Oppenheimer saying that they were having the best time and Murphy had to be focused and couldn’t/didn’t join in bc he was depriving himself of sleep and so zoned in and focused) but his reaction to her saying how much fun it was made me laugh 😂😂
Ple...ase revisit Peaky F...n blinders... Just phenomenal
Luck of the bloody Irish eh! I reckon Cillian sniffed her seat when she pissed off home!
Even Margot can't convince me that  an overhyped movie about a plastic doll can be anything but that. Seriously...
Haven’t watched Barbie, read from very many articles and reviews that it’s underlying message is meant to bash men and glorify women above them.  I hate things like that, we are all equal
Thank you Variety for this video. I come here for Cillian Murphy, one of my favorite actor
Margot is such a great producer. She also aiming to produce the peaky blinder movie. Genius
Great interview!
This is gonna change the future
I love how passionate and committed Margot is to the craft of acting, she’s going to be one of the greatest actors period.  Cillian is one of the nicest interlocutor ever.  What a lovely pairing and insightful conversation.
If they actually make a Barbenheimer movie, then it would be the perfect opportunity to re-release Barbie and Oppenheimer on the same day as Barbenheimer
43:13 thank me later the reason u came here😂
Say Barbenheimer
40:37 We all know she means MCU lol. And other movies that over do cgi
43:15 if you're looking for the peaky blinders part. Thanks me later.
RIP Benjamin Zephaniah
Barbie and the Bomb
Barbenheimer Zindabad
why is the audio so bad
There's a huge difference in these two and it's very clear here.
Barbie was terrible idk what world do these ppl who like these movie live in
this was adorable.
I WANT MORE
cillian wishing he got invited to the dance party :( this was such a cool pairing, their personalities compliment each other
God loves you and takes care of you so that this message reaches you. God is the one who created this great universe and has complete control over it. And the greatest loss that a person loses in this life is that he lives while he does not know God who created him, knowing the Messenger of Muhammad, the last of the messengers, and the Islamic religion, the last of the heavenly religions.  The great intelligence, before you believe in something or not, is to read it, study it, and understand it well, and then you have the choice to believe in it or not. I advise you on this now before you do not have time to do that.
great conversation, but Margot please stop cutting in at the middle of sentences, it's super annoying
Naww wasn't that sweet - having thoroughly enjoyed both films I found that a fascinating insight into what goes into making such masterpieces...and what a nice couiple of people, no wonder they're at the top of their game!
Variety really took Barbenhimer meme to another level
They were just so pure throughout the conversation! Love the way they went into the details. Thankyou Variety for this
Both phenomenal actors and human beings in general
I love it!
It's such a refreshing interview honestly. Cillian's mostly asking about how Margot took bold risks as a producer/actor for Barbie while Margot was just fangirling over Cillian's filmography. This was a good conversation
still waiting for Cillian to finish his story on how did it go with his parents after watching Oppenheimer in Paris
I think Variety did something right with this form of content. Half of the time with interviews the interviewer can ask the most superficial questions (which isn’t inherently the interviewer’s fault if they have not acting experience). When an actor is talking to a fellow actor they know how to ask the right questions about their craft and you can see that in the sincerity of their response.
margot begging him for more peaky blinders is very relatable
50 mins of me just looking in their eyes
TOMMY F**KIN' SHELBY
Two doctors who worked at arkham asylum, who then turned into supervillains.
Both movies were awesome no doubt.
Niente risse! Niente fottute risse!
Sorry but after 2 minutes I started skipping all the part where Margot was speaking, she's beautiful though
Barbenheimer is the Hottest topic of Cinema after so many decade... This two brought people together with their respective gendre❤❤❤
somone pleaaaaase cast these too for a movie together
Beautiful conversation between exellent actors❤ as a young actress this is helping a lot! Thank u!
Let's be real. It was good seeing a massive success from films that weren't superhero flicks. Hopefully, this gives the studios different projects more chances.
I love how Margot pronounces Greta as Greter
awww margot fangirling just like the rest of us
Margot never stop talking,  let him speak 😂😂😂
The interview we didn't know we needed and I'm here for it🔥🔥
Imagine these two Barbenheimer actors being Reed Richards and Sue Storm in the MCU!! 😍💓
Amazing…. Margot’s questions on prep and just in general the whole interview are so thoughtful and impressive… Cillian was great too but he’s more of the nonchalant introspective type.
Tbh the day these movies were in the cinema in my country, men created a division like "men go watch oppenheimer and women go watch barbie", they started hating on a barbie movie, literally a doll and also seemed bothered by the fact that women were going together in pink. The absurd is that men do this all the time in soccer games or when a marvel movie comes out and nobody says a thing. I bet some people went to watch oppenheimer just to be against barbie lmao. I am sure the actors and directors didn't plan to create this division, the movies are so different and i admire cillian and margot and their work , they are very talented.
so epic
Never saw thommy shelby laugh
We need Cillian to be casted in a Martin Scorcese film, and in a Wes Anderson fim ASAP.
so barbeinheimer is canon now
Oppenheimer is boring and Barbie is shallow but l love both Cillian and Margot.
Margo Robbie is soooo beautful <3
Love this!
Aha Dr. Jonathan Crane talking to Harley Quinn...interesting🤔😁
Literally perfect
next step is relese a double feature blue-ray!)) peoles buy is just for collection))
Cillian would be SUCH a gorgeous Ken
I’m not part of that culture but it was a fun movie
You hear that, us Americans have muscular mouths😂😂😂  Edit thanks Margo for pushing for a Peaky Blinders movie, but it's probably for the best not to.
great interview, little side note but I swear to god Cillian Murphy looked great and then BAM 💥 .. one day he just looks ancient lol
Margot clearly loves learning more about people and genuinely having conversations with people. Excited to see what films she produces next or maybe even one day gets into directing?
I’m not usually watching these sorts of things as I am not invested in pop culture and celebrities, but as a Cillian Murphy admirer, I just had to! And Margot Robbie is lovely as well, such a nice discussion. Thank you!
This was one of the better ones, but these videos are trash. Two actors kissing eachothers... well you know. Gagarific.
unpopular oinion....both movies sucked
I'm in love with how free Cillian is and how engaging the conversation was for the both of them!
Other people: Barbie and Oppenheimer Me: Harley Quinn and Scarecrow
Hopefully not for the last time 🤐
finally !!!!!!💕💕
Thomas shelby in the house .❤
YES THIS IS WHAT WE WANTED
Barbie wouldn’t have done so well if it wasn’t for the memes
I LIKE IT SO MUCH
2 of the most stunningly gorgeous people.
Whoever paired these 2 together deserves not just a raise but a medal. He's usually so bored during interviews lol. Love this so much. And the way the cast of each of these films supporting each other even though they were so different...love it
Cillian😍
i know everyone now would say it would be amazing to see them in a film together, but i'd also SO love to see them almost switch roles and work with the other directors - Cillian with Greta Gerwig and Margot with Christopher Nolan - and see how their performances are influenced.   this was such a fun and insightful conversation!
😍
Wow, an interview with 2 Hollywood-Actors, that are NOT constantly buttering each other up, great stuff.
They look like siblings
This was soooo good!!! Two incredible actors!❤️
Dr. Crane & Dr. Quinzel. That’s more like it.
margot gay
This was lovely ❤️
I can listen to Cillian Murphy for hours. So charismatic.
Calling it now, we're looking at this year's Best Actor and Best Actress Oscar winners!
😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️
Now I need Greta and Christopher to sit down and have a lovely chat like this one.
😍My oh My she is so beautiful!
HYPED FOR THIS ONE! 🖤🖤🖤
Difference was thay when people saw Oppenheimer evwryone was happy but when everyone saw Barbie, half of the people sid what the fuck is this shit?
Barbenheimer  taking over summer was something the world needed two completely different movies brining people together
That 48 minutes passed by so quickly. Really interesting to listen to both talk about their roles and the depth of the characters and how they go about preparing for the roles. What a great pairing. Really enjoyed it.
I genuinely cannot imagine anyone else as Barbie.
Томас Шелби напрягает Барби
At the same time, for Barbie, it was impossible for it to be a flop, given the incredible promotion of the film. I have never seen this in my life even for Star Wars or Marvels (I live in Europe)
Dr. Doom and Invisible Woman??
Margot discussing about babrbie's story infront of Oppenheimer's hero😂😂😂
A rare Cillian appearance!
I could listen to these to talk all day.
Bros didn’t want to be there
I literally cannot picture Cillian watching Barbie. I need footage of that moment.
While we watch mudane interviews lets just remember the genocide in Palestine and congo. Never let mindless Consumerism distract you from whats happening in the world
By order of the Peaky Blinders.
Barbie Oppenheimer collab goes brazy
WE NEED MORE LIKE THIS
Both their voices are pleasant to listen to.
Thank you for the subtitles :)
She didn't let him finish his thought or story so many times.
I could these two talk forever
is so funny how Cillian can be saying the most sweet thing ever and looking so pissed of all the time.
They both made movies that was very intriguing and new to the masses after seeing the overpopulated superheroes in the theatres it was like a breath of fresh air looking foward going to the theatres again.
둘이 대화가 너무 매끄럽게 잘 되서 가만히 듣는 내가 다 힐링되고 재밌음
https://youtu.be/gAJaGSjzmis?si=vhIyBbyGTXBzKEfs
Thank you variety for giving us THEEE MOST iconic interview !
AHHHH !!!!!!!
This conversation will go down to the history. No doubt.
I love the fact that Margot asked about peaky blinders She used her impactful voice, representing the masses,    Yesssssss!!!!! ❤
35:43 OMG THAT FLIRT HAHAHAH
What a brilliant conversation.
That's the most cilian has spoken in an interview ❤
I love this series!  Also I'd like to see a movie with both of them :)
peaky fcking blinders
Both actors are great but Oppenheimer is a far superior movie
27:02-27:13 THAT FLIRTING. THAT´S BARBENHEIMMER
Why are they trying to speak in American accent )
You know what would be smart someone casting them in the SAME movie
Was great to see both of them talk film together. But is it just me or was the sound recorded or edited weirdly enough that their voices don't naturally trail off?
Why Barbenheimer isn't the title of the video. 😂
Agreed. The appetite viewers have for quality story telling is very broad in range. The fact that a lot of people watched both in a day or weekend, proved this.
I loved hearing both their own techniques to feel into their characters. They are so creative and passionate. This interview really brings out their inner vigor and seeing that bounce off each other is simply Excellent💗🖤
Anyone who wants Margot Robbie to take part in Upcoming Peaky Blinders Movie , Like this cmt.
need a film with them together
Love it ❤
I'd love to see a movie with them playing husband and wife.
I looove Margot but am I the only one that doesn't understand why she keeps interrupting him!!!!!!
Margoat Robbie 🐐
Haven’t seen either.
This was brilliant I didn't even register the fact that it was almost an hour, I want to see them together again desperately
He is so irish but shows no accent when acting, so goddamn clever
Amazing how Greta Gerwig went from starring in mumblecore movies from 2008-12 that barely anyone saw to becoming the highest grossing female director in movie history.
يا زينهم ما قدرت اوقف ، ليته اطول ❤
Two of the most unavoidable faces on the planet 🙄
The movie Oppenheimer was great, the cast was great, but the only thing, that the movie miss it, it's a dramatic scene of a two atomic bombs hit the two cities of Japan!
they’re just so enjoyable to listen to. it’s so interesting and i love that margot makes cillian so comfortable enough to talk more.
This is just one of the best video on YouTube!! , thanks for this and putting this whole !!
i love Cillian he is really really good actor 😘😃
The most beautiful white woman in America, easily
actor on actor?  what a weird title
i like both these actors in other stuff... Barbie was trash, and Openheimer  was the worst Nolan movie made... you'll get em on the next ones pals...
I love how it’s December and Barbenheimer is still a trending topic! 2023 was their year.
Major props to the person that paired these two
forever upset the barbies didn't just do a barbie marathon
Doctor Doom and Harley Quinn.
yea  -cillian murphy
Great dialogue between actor and actress❤
What a brilliant pair for this style of interview!
never imagined tommy shelby and harley quinn sitting together
not Barbie and Oppenheimer having deep conversation
Barbenheimer was like when Doom and Animal Crossing had releases at the same time in 2020.
I enjoy that Margot is a sponge. She's the student here but she's taking in everything Cillian is saying because she understands the luck talking to a peer that is skilled in so many ways she isn't yet.  I understand why some people may think she's being disrespectful talking over Cillian sometimes but she's fangirling a bit but he is not an interviewee at all and I think she understands this is a key moment to be able to stick a pin in him and talk to us all. She's pretty, sure.. but she's whip smart. I look forward to what comes next for them both
Best Actor and Best Actress of the year,  right here folks.
The woman with no inner voice is basically what Buddhism aspire to 😅
I adore this actors on actors idea. I feel like there’s such a more relaxed vibe that I’ve I don’t know if I’ve ever seen on a traditional interview. What a stellar idea! More of this please!
This is amazing
Margot, I love you girl, but please, let him speak HAHAHAHHA
time for ryan gosling and matt damon
Variety understood the assignment👏
The way they talk of their directors makes me want to watch Murphy in a Gerwig movie and Robbie in a Nolan film.
Aren’t we tired to talk about these movies?
This was everything I've ever wanted
great conversation. my only issue is that margot didn't interrupt enough times
Y'all the way I was DEVOURING every single bit of Cillian's talking. Only the fans know how precious is having him speaking so lightly and for such a long time. That man never shows up anywhere, he doesn't have social media, it's a suffering to love him
Who came from insta reel
Does anyone have a source to support what Margot said about the size difference in American mouths and Australian mouths? Because that's really fascinating
Joyful, absolute joy given off by two people that are at the pinnacle of their professional lives.
I didnt even finish to watch Barbie so Anerican and flat. Disappointed
43:52
DUUUUUUDEEEEEEE! They BOTH have the same coloured eyes!
Cillian you are so handsome and unreal.Love you
2 phenomenal actors with androgynous beauty
i love this!!! seeing them both in one video, how much more in a good movie!! love them both
“Actors on Actors” it kinda sounds like a porn category
His first question is about the process and being bold in her film making. Her first question is about memes. Lovely.
the movie were so different yet so complimentary to each other in the weirdest way
is peaky blinders worth the watch? i been wanting to watch it
3u2❤❤❤❤❤😮😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
WE NEED THEM IN A FILM PLEASE
He’s such a good listener just one more reason why he should be my husband
Margot needs to marry him, the tension could be cut with a razor
TOMMMMMMYYYYYY!!!!
8:00    Remember All His Movies Around 21 St
British guy and Australian sitting each other to talks about movie that they played as an American 😂😂😂
I don’t think I could love Cillian anymore than I already do. 🤤
Why does she keep interrupting him. Jeez calm down BARBIE
This is wt actors with knowledge look like !
This is the most I've watched Cillain speak in interviews and general. lol !!
Lets be honest, barbie was only successful because of its marketing and star cast, not because it "connected" with the audience
21st of July 2023 was a good birthday!
Tommy Shelby and harley quinn wouldnt think i'd see the day
In, this interview side quest be, how manz times Margot robbie says " U know".
I would love to see them both together in a movie, I really thought they knew each other from before or something because they have great chemistry. Also, (TW) first i saw Oppenheimer and then I saw Barbie the day after a traumatic event in a party involving sexual abuse and the movie genuinely saved my life. I'm a big fan of both so i am thrilled that they got the popularity that they deserved, they are masterpieces and Margot Robbie and Cillian Murphy are incredible as well as Greta Gerwig and Christopher Nolan.
I’m still confused who the writer/director is on Barbie and why I should care lol. She looks fairly young too. I heard the movie was pretty shady to the opposite sex and for absolutely no reason. That would have ruined it for me.
PJ bhai
I could watch these 2 talk all day
Margot: Can't believe this is the first time I'm meeting you! Cillian: Likewise.
Barbie and Oppenheimer in one room
Cillian laughed & smiled so much in this. Margot's joy and enthusiasm is contagious. I love seeing them together and hope for a new project with them in the leads.
Please cillian and billie elish
41:27 Margot fangirling over Emily is such a cute delightful moment!
I can’t believe I watch all of it without a single skip these are absolute remarkable personalities
Margot did us a favour asking cillian to do a Peaky blinders movie 😭
honestly, they need to do a movie together
They need to be in a movie together or imma riot
I clicked on this video and I see the duration is 48:27 seconds and I tell myself "I'm in for a long ride" but then I got lost in the conversation and their dynamic that I lost track of time. And then I pause the video and I see that it's the end and I realize that it went too fast!!!😭😭😭😭😭😭 Let me posit that maybe our enjoyment of something may increase our attention span since we lose track of time when something is pleasant, maybe there's so much content that we dread it and lose patience for it so we spend less of our attention on it as a result of that. Maybe quality instalments can increase our attention spans, who knows but everybody's talking about how it's decreasing but never talks about how to increase it or regain it.
these duo are so powerful
Can't wait for their ABBA bio movie in 2025..
Genuine talk... But he could elaborate more with his movies though...
Tomas Shelby negotiating the deal for the London territory with the Margot Robbie - gangster’s head.
omg Murphy looking fine asf😭
Awkward. They don't know what to say or the subject is so ridiculous.
so we're just "children"👁👄👁
@ 8:28 what Cillian said explained why both these movies are massive hits and many failed. The audience dont like to be told what to do, if they like it they'll gather the interests themselves  This is something that those woke movies massively dont understand. You dont get to guilt trip and tell the audience if you dont like this movie you're a bigot, anti-feminist, racist, etc. If your movie is fresh and well made it's enough
I love when the news broke that both films were releasing on my birthday and the hype of both made me glad. But man barbie was surprisingly awesome and heartwarming. Still need to see Oppenheimer.
A normal conversation between an Introvert and an extrovert.
Dunno which surprised me more. Nolan not having a phone or Nolan making a script in first person POV?
Margot fangirling about Peaky Blinders is what we all needed to see!
So interesting to see how Margot fills all the time by herself, and Cillian very naturally takes a role of listener! All the techniques of active listening are there! Amazing! There was almost nothing about Oppenheimer because of it)
Both movies were absolute shit
What a pair. Holy shit
Damn Barbie keeps yapping someone shut her up
damn like 6 mos too late
Ladies and Gentleman introducing  Barbieheimer
"...get everyone comfortable with being uncomfortable." That's such a powerful line.
Can Margot let Cillian speak please?
Finally Cillian knows what a meme is 😂
Margot robbie 😍
god they’re both so intelligent this was an amazing episode
kkkkk Margot is fangirling so much. I wish there were a movie with them together
Margot is a great conversationalist
https://youtube.com/shorts/R0GsfwxFj4A?si=9xXuoxoaXnA8Fx4z
life peaked in the barbenheimer era
Fun fact: they both have played Batman villains in the big screen.
Can't believe she was just 23 while shooting Wolf Of The Wall Street. She's probably the best actress rn.

Que bien  se vieron juntos saludos soy David de Ecuador
I know it's been said a hundred times but this pairing was legendary.
I am so obsessed with this duo! someone please find a movie for them to star in together!!
I love their conversation. It's always interesting to know the process behind the storytelling they did and how they manage to make their characters seem so natural.
Barbie was alright, Oppenheimer was a masterpiece.
barbenheimer fr
I could look at Cillian Murphys eyes like every second of my life, my god.
can Margot Robbie let Cillian Murphy talk? like she can't stop interrupting
We want part -2 ❌ WE NEED PART - 2✅
Margot made Cillian laugh!!!!! Such a great idea to pair them and chat, LOVED THIS 🥰
the barbenheimer keeps making box office on youtube too, by making 2,6 million viewers only in nearly 2 days 😅
Realism vs surrealism ❤
Why is YouTube recommendations  forcing this on my feed
I am obsessed with Cillian Murphy performances ❤❤❤
Can she let him talk and not interrupt every 10 seconds
Cillian and Christopher being two INTJs making a biopic about the life of another INTJ is my favorite thing, like hell yeah you share tastes and views
The “fascist” joke was the hardest I laughed. So glad it stayed in
queria TANTO um filme c esses dois agr!!!!!
we got Thomas Shelby and Barbie in the same room, pinch me im dreaming.
I’m so glad she brought up Peaky Blinders, love him as Tommy Shelby! Interesting hearing about the mechanics behind the production decisions on each movie. This is the first interview I’ve watched in a long time, actors on actors interviewing each other is a brilliant concept. Love their energy, hope they’re in another original movie together. Definitely over remakes.
SHE'S SO REAL FOR THE CALM APP COMMENT I CANT
margo's fangirling at the end KILLED ME I'M LITERALLY HER LIKE YES GIRLL I CANNOT CONTAIN MY EXCITEMENT EITHER THE CALM APP KILLED ME BC SAAAAAAAME gosh I love her she's so real for that
Such a great year for cinema!
They both look so great and margot is actually stunning oml
I just love how natural cillian is… no vanity, nothing fake, no facade… just him, pure and simple. It’s really calming listening to him
Cillian Murphy is a fantastic listener
Love this for us 😊
Oscar Noms and wins for both! Barbenheimer is too big to ignore 🥰🥰🥰🥰
I loved this
This was brilliant I clicked on it and thought that maybe I would listen for a few minutes and finished it out . Great job and they were so easy and comfortable and natural and it didn’t feel forced to me. Great watch.
Love it when I witness an Irish actor is having a conversation with an Australian actress and they speak each other with different accent.
I just fell in love with Margo for obsessing on Peaky Blinders.  As this “interview” went forward, I was literally imagining if Margo Robbie would fawn over him for it.  Blown away, and so deserving for Cillian.  Class A all around!
Wow so beautiful meeting Cillian. And Margot blow up my mind is amazing the conversation..I never thinking seeing these two together have fun is lovely ❤
@43:35 Margo is representing all of us😎
I LOVE THEM SO MUCH
I had no idea they were both British until they started talking. Now my tinnitus from winging a handle of Jim Beam into a gas ('petrol' for those overseas) station trash can in 2004 is acting up, and my corneas are spewing blood and tears all over my recording station. Thanks a lot Variety.
HE IS SO FIND I WONT HIM SO BAD
After watching this I now need to watch Barbie again😭   Also need to watch Oppenheimer but I ain’t buying it for $20😭
Stu pid actress and stupid movie 🤢🤮🤮
😂😂 la Wendy Guevara chabelo Margot es la abuela  no es Barbie teeneger 😂 es la Barbie arrugada aniñada
What is the Barbie movie about? I'm guessing it's about feminism but not really basing that off of anything in particular, just figure with how everything is these days it's going to be some sort of woke film. Although they chose to go with white actors so maybe it's not as woke as I though.
His eyes are art.
He's a great listener
She’s so beautiful
god i love them
she was the perfect barbie bruh like she looks exactly like my old barbie its crazy
This actors on actors series is AMAZINGGGG
As someone who enjoyed the entirety of the Barbenhiemer phenomenon, it feels so surreal to see this paring actually take place. It HAPPENED AND ITS HERE
crazy margot didn’t watch any of the barbie movies from the past or barbie life in the dream house to prep
Margot wanting authenticity of her process, her film, from Cillan. And she gets and deserves it. Fantastic
Love this!! Oh the charisma Cillian haveee
omg that was the first time they met each other??? they have a real good connection, loved it so much
They need a project
Apparently, it was Cillian's team that reached out to Variety asking for the pairing, and I find that super wholesome.
I’m glad these people are where they are.
Part of what made Barbenheimer so special to me was that it wasn't Barbie vs Oppenheimer but it merged them together and created a  love-child/love-letter to cinema
god. thank you variety!
I slept on Cillian, I knew about him he has unforgettable face but I've never realised HOW talented he is. and now looking back it's probably because he plays the characters so differently and they seem like completely different person. I always notice when I think "oh, the actor is acting well" but you won't have that with him because he is the character you won't think about Cillian. maybe it's just me but for me he must be one of the most talented actors. imagine Cillian in this interview and try to connect him to Tommy Shelby. they seem like 2 different people, not one actor playing 2 characters. is it just me? :)
I'm so thankful for everyone who organized thissss
I find it so human of Margot Robbie watching YouTube and talking about memes. I can just imagine her skipping ads or watching shitpost stuff on the site
I can’t believe they put me in this video without my permission
Margot literally had the best, most thought provoking questions. It's so nice to talk to an intelligent person. I'm specifically talking about the dialect discussions, filming with imax film, etc.
Margot is sooooooo charismatic a Cillian so effortlessly cool
Is it just me ,or is everyone were smiling throughout the video
Margot: "I love that song SO much, it's on my cry playlist..." Me: "Hey I have a cry playlist!" Margot: "...if I need to cry on set." Me: "Oh. Yeah me too...🥲"
Will Smith fumbled
Cillian is getting more light in his older age. Less serious
idk but cillian looks like he wants me to kiss him
Whoever paired these 2 together deserves not just a raise but a medal. He's usually so bored during interviews lol. Love this so much. And the way the cast of each of these films supporting each other even though they were so different...love it
I hope they open the Barbie world set to the public in the future so people could tour it
I double-featured them, on the same day. *Quite a ride.*
i can imagine how fun it is to be in barbie set and the barbenheimer phenomenon is something that maybe can't be replicated again in the future. such an amazing interview ❤
The doom/animal crossing release really prepped for the arrival of barbeinheimer
They would be great in a movie together!
It was so so refreshing to have some good movies to see this summer. Like in my child hood.  I hope it continues.
It's really comforting to know that Harley Quinn and the Scarecrow were able to put aside their differences to talk about the craft of acting. They're both doctors so I really need to examine my external biases.
I found her so interruptive, which bored him with 50 “yeah”, “yeah” responses. 🥲
I usually fast forward countless times when watching interviews, but watching these two was such a delight that I didn’t even bother and was sad when was over.
Cillian is like a fine glass of whiskey and Robbie is like a Truly lmao
Meus dois atores preferidos ❤
I need a movie with these two starring as the main characters   BY THE ORDER OF THE PEAKY FOOKIN BLINDERS
Tbh i haven't seen the film Barbie cuz I was not interested but yeah i don't hate the film
Oh she is gushing over meeting him.  Please keep talking and someday work together please.
Definition of barbenheimer
My lord, I f$caking love Cillian.
Harley Quinn and Scarecrow on top of their game
BARBENHEIMER OMG
Not sure if Cillian is the right pick to talk about Barbie
Thank you for asking him about peaky blinders Margot
I absolutely love how Margot is so excited while talking to Cillian about his role in Peaky Blinders. She looks like any other fan when meeting one of their favourite characters.
Margot needed her own interview 😂 she navigates this whole conversation but he does an amazing job pulling back and working with her
This was beautiful
There is a lot of tension/organic chemistry created by their opposing personalities. A movie together would be great.  It is also nice to see Cillian engaged from the start. He laughed a lot at Margot's silliness. Good job on requesting Variety to pair up with Margot for this. It is perfect.
Margot is hot as hell Cillian too!😉
the way she starts fangirling over him and talking about peaky blinders is so adorable
I love both of their work, so a conversational pairing is perfect.
would not have thought that was there first time meeting! they got on really well & love that she is obsessed with peaky blinders like the rest of us 😭🫶
A Margot Robbie tietando o Cillian Murphy é ótima! A sinergia dessas produções é histórica!
I hope they come to work together in the future!
Didn't Cilian started to sound American ?
she is way smarter than I thought she would be. I'm not saying I thought she would be stupid, but she plays a bimbo so well it's hard not to think she might be one, but she clearly works very hard and thunks a lot about what she does. this was very interesting. I like hearing good actors waffle on about acting and stuff.
why did he say it like that is he acoustic?
I found This American Life episode of the woman who can't intospect! It's *Ep. 731 "What Lies Beneath"* 🩷
Murphy looks like Oli London
Margot bringing up Peaky Blinders because she’s obsessed is me frfr She gets it 😌 and just begging him for the movie too haha 😂
Haven’t seen it but this is going to be iconic
Margot is so damn smart. I loved this interview so much. I could watch them talk to each other for hours.
Honestly I like these 2 but wasn’t really interested in the movies they put out this year
Harley Quinn was missed here !!
Given Barbenheimer's success, I think it would be poetic to see Margot in the Peaky Blinders film. 🙌
Both great actors and both decent films. But i like barbie a bit more because it felt like a hug and fun and all that. And it made men mad which i loved most. #fragilemasculinity
THIS WAS AMAZING
Two great actors also I never watched start to finish on other actors. I love these two people. So great video thanks Cillan your a legend 🙌
I've seen both movies twice in cinema. Both are masterpieces.
I love them so much like ughhhhhh I can’t get enough of this interview 😭💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗
I hope a trilogy happens for Barbie the movie, with all about Ken on part 2, and Barbie and Ken finally ending up together anyways on the third installment
my bisexual ass is going insane watching this video
The top actor and actress of our time coming together. We need more conversations like this.
Way too much talk in barbie. The blonde has two brain cells. What a waste.
Cillian Murphy, You are simply brilliant, to see any performance you do is to fall in love with the acting career knowing that not everyone can do it. I love the way you are not a showbiz person but 100% talented. Bless. Margot Robbie, Beautiful and smart, sweet and tough, perfect!
Love Margo. Was so excited for Barbie. But it was terrible, was very disappointed. Hated that Ken was a joke and the women bashed men. Just terrible feminist crap.
By orders of peaky focking blinders. Hi Cillian! Huge fan of you man.
I LOVE ALL ABOUT THIS!!!!!!  Thank you!  Also: Can someone find out that interview with the woman without introspect? I am highly interested in seeing it.
Margot & Cillian ❤
they are both so beautiful and i love the way they speak to each other.
Those movies was original, not the recently, usual super hero and action movie crap . I always love a  real person stories. There are so many interesting true stories out there.  Thank you for the good entertainment.
I really love this!, I dream with  these amazing actors together when the Barbenheimer event happened and now they actually talking! :) She's so me talking about peaky blinders even He looks very comfortable, a gorgeous cast 💓
It’s funny hearing them talk naturally after hearing them with accents in the movies
Am I losing my mind or did this feel flirty
the worlds favorite white people
I keep forgetting she’s Harley Quinn
OHMYGOD CILLIAN MURPHY AHHHHHH
Is this the interview where Murphy does the maniacle sit
🔥
Two Batman villains united, Harley Quinn and scarecrow!!!.
Barbenheimer juntos.... ❤️ ❤️ ❤️
barbenheimer assemble!!!!.
For all the interiew i was like <- Im gay -> oh actually im not <- damn but i am tho -> but look at her she is perfect i love her <- Cilliam walk over me
They know when their movie will be hit, they pay a big price for this so… remember they work in entertainment, goal is keep you distracted couse you can handle feeling of boredom in these days, Remeber your focus is so precious… and actress are slaves
I wish i could have like this conversation with someone
Lets goooo
I love them so much
hearing cillian murphy and margot robbie say my birthday is a great day is the biggest flex
I’m obsessed with Actors on Actors 🤍
Oppenheimer was sooo boring
Especially love the release date of 21 July 🎉 felt like birthday gifts just for meeee (and everyone else with the same birthday) 🎂
https://youtube.com/@CEM-UK?si=rn1lL9vopo7LhyEZ
One of the most beautiful faces in Hollywood… Margot Robbie’s not to bad either.
Really enjoyed this convo!!! More than I thought I would.
Margot was SUCH a fan of his, and I feel like Cillian was like "hi, nice lady". Like he had no idea of who she was. 😅
I love how Margot is a talented, incredible and serious actor but also every bit of a clued up millennial, fangirling so damn hard for Cilian, who he’s worked with and just the movie industry in general. What a queen. 😂❤
Margot Robbie fangirling over Cillian Murphy like all of us is something i did not expect lmfao makes me love her even more
They need to work together!!! The absolute best!!!
I watched all of it at once. Thank you for this ❤ great content 💯
She controlled the conversation and made it worth watching.
i loooooooooove them
This is my roman empire
A movie with Margot, Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh please. STAT.
They looked good together, they need a movie for sure
Wagwan for his accent? He's meant to be irish.
lets be honest , if there wasn't Ryan Gosling in Barbie, it wasn't be so popular
6 movies with Christopher Nolan? Oh, so you like the guy... Margot is so precious.
Is it getting hot in here 😏
Margot Robbie being genuinely excited to talk about pesky blinders is just great
I now need them to be cast in the same movie. #makeithappen
"Obviously I've now revealed that I'm a big fan of yours, not just 'Peaky Blinders', I also love your sleep story on the calm app."
margot is such a pro interviewer the way she gets cillian so comfortable after a point
LEGENDS
my roman empire
The resemblance between them is really uncanny!
i keep thiking about that one barbenheimer fanfic, and now that i see them both in the same, i totally notice the chemistry!
I am so over Barbie talk
i hope the producers of those movies met one day by chance over drinks and decided to drop both movies on the same day, putting their faith onto 25 year old kids online making memes as advertisement. would be the biggest genius move in hollywood for years.
Idk if anyone noticed but Margot’s microphone would be perfect size for a Barbie 🩷
another video that challenges my bisexuality.
Wow! I must say I am impressed. First of all, it makes me so glad to see when people literally trying to get us much as they an from each other, because they are constantly learning and developing themselves. You can see how passionate, intelligent, beautiful they both are. And I never thought Cillian is so humble and can be so easy-going and friendly. And of course I love all Margot movies, the way she works on her characters is just 💥
Cillian was right we were STARVING for cinema
There's therapy or there's Cillian Murphy & Margot Robbie Actors on Actors
Huh, is she australian?
i want Christopher Nolan and Greta Gerwig please
I NEED a film with both of them
i wish they would talk little more about their personal life rather than they movies but overall it was a nice interview
Tbh I skipped Margot Robbie I’m sorry but I’m a sucker for Cillian 🤤
The Barbieheimer ❤
Here we go guys.. We've finally got Barbenheimer
All that beauty, talent, and intelligence in one place. What a treat.
Cillian looks more like barbie than Margot
She should have asked about his radio show
Thanks for this episode. It's among the very best Actors on Actors series. They both held an interest in each other's questions while conveying points of interest about their respective films and characters. It's a compelling conversation.
I've never been so happy, what an impeccable exchange. Amazing, everything!! What about the questions? Very well done!! I just have to congratulate those who had this brilliant idea and put these two together for this conversation/interview. Now I'm going to rewatch the two movies and pay attention to the details they mentioned. Seriously, that's amazing 🤩
Cillian Murphy & Margot Robbie are amazing 🔥🔥 Thanks to Variety for bringing them together in one frame
a shame barbie was a bad movie.
I always liked Margot but after seeing this, she’s my absolute #1 fave female actor. She seems so fully aware of the filmmaking process and makes her decisions, whether it be as a producer or actor, based on the art and story. Love her. ❤
This was so interesting 💕 I love it when my favorite actors get together and have conversations/ Q&A’s. They look so comfortable with one another!   You can tell they really respect each other and enjoy answering one another’s questions because they understand one another’s craft. You can tell they inspire eachother 🙌🏽
Awesome actors ❤
Cillian has one of the most impressive fake American accents in cinema
I think ladies like Margot are the possible salvation of Hollywood, she may feel certain ways on politics but all she does is present good representations of women without the preaching. Look at her career she hasnt to date played a victim and almost all her characters are likeable in a certain way and yet the characters have all been independent, smart capable women. Thats how you influence culture..with image and whispers..dont yell ever..turns everyone off even when the message is good.
43:12 Thomas Shelby
Thank you, they were both very lovely! Margot is sooooo charming, even Cillian seemed to really enjoy it haha
Thank you, they were both very lovely! Margot is sooooo charming, even Cillian seemed to really enjoy it haha
She is... almost startling or breathtaking really. Really smart, really good looking, not malicious at heart, industrious, passionate, confident and a hustler who works hard. Quite a woman, I think a deserved star.  Hopefully she lasts, she just reached greatness.
As a fellow actor I would have loved to see them talk more about their process to prepp for the role lol.  Loved watching them. It was peculiar somehow, can't describe. A lovely back and forth aligned chemistry somehow between the two.
Margo asking about peaky blinders yes queen we needed that
I need an interview pt 2
37:05 how Margot stops laughing with such a control. crazy how actors can control their emotions.
This duo is everything
This perfect combination of two worlds gives viewers a unique opportunity to see it not through rose-colored glasses, as is the case with Barbie dolls, or Oppenheimer's dark or perhaps more penetrating gaze, but rather through real being, participating in something that we can safely call a feast for the senses. wall-to-wall passions, however, we are in a state of relative balance because on the one hand there are sweet characters straight from Sue's novel, on the other hand there is an apocalyptic vision of our planet taken over by a mind that is both theoretical and crazy, and this is an explosive mixture.
I was hoping to catch the moment where Cilian does the sitting while standing position. Some things just aren't meant to be
hot australian family
Cillian Murphy makes everyone he's with look nomal
The accent they are talking about around the 27:30 minute mark is called the Trans-Atlantic accent. It was the way Old Hollywood actors like Orson Welles, Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall, etc. would speak in the movies. I always enjoy hearing those accents when I watch older films.
Lol at Cillian referring to himself as unemployed 😂. (I know it’s a term actors use, still funny for someone of his success)
Monolog but good
Barbenheimer
woman crush weds
Years ago I saw Margot at the 'I Tonya' premiere discussing her dreams to be a producer more often. It's fantastic to witness her success!
Jesus, how gorgeous and witty she is.  Cillian is being himself, dreamy as always.
Harley Quinn and the Scarecrow talk about their recent life decisions
"Yuh" - Cillian Murphy
love these two
both of them have played batman villains
Please Margot, let the man finish!
Thank God they talk about Peaky!!!!
BRING THEM AGAAAAIN
Y'all the way I was DEVOURING every single bit of Cillian's talking. Only the fans know how precious is having him speaking so lightly and for such a long time. That man never shows up anywhere, he doesn't have social media, it's a suffering to love him
this is the best interview on earth!! my god I love them❤
The crossover we all waited for 🖤💗
margot robbie literally just unlocked my ability to do a consistent aussie accent with that soft/hard palate insight
Both movies were terrible. Worst of the year
Loved this interview. @Variety would love to see Nolan and Gerwig do a director version of this. lets make it happen!
I've seen Oppenheimer...I'm gonna see Barbie now
Super stars ✨
This is no.4 on the trending page!!! Awesome!!   It’s 2:23 PM at the moment.
#Barbenheimer
This gotta be the best actors on actors ever. Kudos to whoever thought of joining these two
she's so real for bringing up his sleep story on the calm app
These two carried 2023🛐🛐
Barbenheimer
Barbie is a really bad movie
We finally got Barbenheimer lessfuckingggooooo
BARBENHEIMER II IS ON.
They got each other and started to mimik each others energy at the end - a really good conversation.  Also a total culturechock …really fun/ funny!
This format is so gooood! It's so interesting to hear them talk about the things THEY want to know about each other. Margot is so relatable being a fan of Cillian, isn't she? So sweet.
Can’t wait to hear their stories on who’s really under that mask..
So nice they love each other’s works. And we do love them! ❤️ hope to see more soon!
Love this
CILLIAN SO HOT
Cillian is not much of a convo guy  You could just tell 😅😅
I NEED MOREEEEEEE
two legendsssss
Will she let him talk!!! 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄
Damn.. they are both so beautiful 🤩
Dude, that was soo fulfilling, I couldn't take my eyes off it. Two beautiful and smart ppl discussing what they love. Admiration for both. #upcork
OK, now someone gotta produce the Peaky Blinders movie, cast Margo and make a ton of cash.
the fact that people don't like "been told what to do", like Cilian mentioned, is the exact fact that made the studios no envolviment in the memes work so much, if thay did the charm would be gone
This scratches the perfect itch in my brain seeing these two together
Havent seen either movie. Both worth it?
Margot is great at answering questions but terrible at asking them lol she doesn't wait for Cillian to finish saying anything! its maddening. like girl let him answer what you asked before springing another question at him or reorienting the conversation
King and Queen.
She is such a blessing to my eyeballs
Margot was waiting to ask abt Peaky Blinders that whole interview
One of the peak moments in entertainment industry.
Wow, what a duo. Thinking they should record a film together.
obsessed with the way margot is fangirling over peaky blinders and asks cillian if they can talk about it and he just goes "sure. if you'd like"
28:39
This man 🔥
This was pure gold
A manly man and a girly girl talking...now thats something new...
I love you so much ❤️😘❤️❤❤
mom and dad
the fact that cillian wanted to be paired with margot so his team asked for it and margot immediately said yes  is my roman empire
The chemistry here between Margot & Cillian could solve peace in the middle east.
The last part of the interview is wholesome. Hoping for team uo
the Barbenhiemer we all needed
Cillian Murphy though 🤤
cillian murphy is so much hotter than margot robbie (no offense) and thats coming from a striaght guy
Barbenheimer era is the best!!! In 2030 and we still remember it, congrats!
well,we needed much longer interviews than 45min, they were so interested in each other and it was interesting to hear them about all the bts process & off topics. this is really a once in a lifetime moment, specially the barbenheimer phenomenon.  i hope they work together in future movies/tv shows.  Dec 6 / 2023 / 11:40 PM
1:47 Cillian thinking some dirty things "yeahh"  🤣🤣🤣
I could listen to them talk for hours. This is fascinating.
who else from twitter 😭
Margot really needed a hit movie after both her movies bombed last year. I happened to love Babylon, I thought it was better than both these movies. You never know what going to hit I guess.
The difference between the movies was that Oppenheimer is a useful movie.  Barbie is not.
margot the realest for asking those questions
We want the movie called Tommy the fuc*** top g
They are sooooo hot
I kinda wanted to hear what Cillian wanted to say about his parents being overwhelmed after seeing the movie. Loved the interview tho
I've yet to watch Barbie yet but I adore Margot Robbie and Ryan Goslin so I know it will be a blast seeing them goof around. Cillian makes amazing role as Oppenheimer and I think the movie is almost Magnum Opus for Nolan although the movie is even super minimalistic compared to his previous work.
Idk, to me he looks like a cannibal.
apparently Cillian asked his team if he could be paired up with Margot and when she was approached she immediately said yes. what a great conversation.
Harley Quinn and the Scarecrow.
I never understand why people liked Barbie 😮😅
Can you let him talk more please? We miss Cillian
Just perfection
Tommy fkn shelby and a fkn barbie
Cillian Murphy is the male version of Margot Robbie  Margot Robbie is the female of Cillian Murphy the resemblance is uncanny
i loved this sm <33, its so different to all the other actors on actors videos i've watched. This one was just so wholesome and real, and as viewers of the film they also made us feel apart of it instead of singling us out.
first time I don't see the meme face of Cillian, he enjoyed this interview :D
Man, we need a Barbieblinders movies phenomenon like we had for Barbenheimer
Cadê as legendas em português?
It is so rare to see Cillian willing to talk so much, but Margo keeps interrupting him :(((
So hot omg
What a beautiful interview!! LOVED this. Cillian and Margot did incredibly well in this
IM BLUSHIIIINGGGG A LOTTTTT
IM BLUSHIIIINGGGG A LOTTTTT
LOL them fuckin filters on them in the thumbnail 🤣
Barbenheimer taking over the summer was something the world needed, two completely different movies bringing people together.
Margot’s social butterflying is bringing out something wonderful in Cillian here. Such a cute interview
Honestly I feel envy towards them. I cannot even imagine how fulfilling it must feel to have this idea/vision in your head, invest time and hard work, get other talented and dedicated people involved in your project, put it out there in the world and have it so widely accepted. This is true happiness.
Please someone get this two a script together ASAP !
PLEASE DO NOT SHOOT ANOTHER BARBIE MOVIE, IT'S ALREADY PERFECT!!!!
How did y’all record audio ? Who edited this ? Audio is trash
We gotta get Margot Robbie to star in a Christopher Nolan film
Cillian be like: Yeah...
17:25 i love this moment of cilian murphy and it shows how professionaly he takes his roles and understands what the director wants from him.
Cillian seems like a great listener. He really pays attention
I could watch Margot Robbie do many things, all day. Chatting with Cillian Murphy after the Summer of 2023 is absolutely one of them.
I was introduced to Cillian with 28 Days Later, and I've loved him ever since. Margot is amazing as well. Two iconic actors of our time.
the peaky blinders part 43:12 thank me later
These two 🫶🏻
Wait ? where is his Irish accent ?
Im not seeing at all what everyone else is seeing. Cillians body language betrays his words. Hes completely nervous and not at ease.
You can tell they have such respect for each others work, even though they couldn't be more different in personality and style. Awesome pairing!
Some folks will take this out of context or apply their own assumptions to the statement, but how gorgeous is Margot Robbie? So intelligent, so engaging, she is one of my all time favorites. Wouldn't surprise me at all to see her move more into the studio side, but I hope she continues to act as well. Just a talented person. Cillian is also one of the most down to earth actors around, he's the definition of class it seems and how he remains so humble while being that talented is astonishing. These two need to work together on the next Greta or Nolan film!
He should have asked her about harley fuckin queen
And here I thought that they are already making serious plans for making the Peaky Blinders movie. We need Tommy Shelby in WW2.
Çok rahat çok sakin çok klas çok profesyonelllll.. C.M.
Taşaktan yürüyemiyor dicem onu da yapıyor, sen ne büyük adamsın be , öz abim benim.
They actually complete eachother and create a good friendship
Is 2M views in 24 hours a good thing?
Margot Robbie pivoting to Peaky?! We're all Margot Robbie, Margot Robbie is all of us.❤
Both are very talented and amazing in acting. Lot of love to Marcill !!
Barbie was mid though
NICE WHAT
can't believe i watched the whole thing...i loved it!
⁠gross humans. Only why I like these two actors, Ryan Gosling or any other blue/green Ocean Blue or Nature Green eyed person. When I look into there eyes don’t want to think about their brown poop 💩 eyes. 👀
thank you Margot for asking about Tommy Shelby, im so desperated to know if i need to prepared to watch this masterpiece again.
Cinema ❤
I wonder what a child would be like between Cillian at his peak age and Margot today. :O
He is Slytherin she is Huffelpuff 🥺
4893 4702 1652 0632 One dollar will save a life
I absolutely love how she‘s interrupting him all the time and can’t stop talking because she’s so into the conversation and he’s just going with it
The best cheekbones in Hollywood. And Margot Robbie is also there.
When extrovert meets introvert. Also it seems Margot is a fan meeting her celebrity idol.
Loved Oppenheimer. Great performance by Cillian.
a massive hit like barbie, I think people often forget how much work and effort it takes to make such a blockbuster movie. she said 6 yrs. That's a long time and they deserve all the success they got
I love Nolan’s work and don’t even get me started on Cillian. I am obsessed with Mr.Cillian Murphy eversince I have watched peaky blinders. And now I have seen all of his movies. He’s so perfect. But after this interview I did some research on Greta Gerwig and I didn’t even realise that I have watched half of her films and some of them are in my favourite list. These two actors and their directors are exceptional and legends. And I would love to see them together in any project.
it would be better if it was ryan gosling and cillian murphy
Who would’ve thought a conversation between a harlequin and a scarecrow would be so engaging
MARGOT FANGIRLING OVER PEAKY BLINDERS AHAHA I LOVE HER
2 million views per day, that's incredible🤩
She keeps interrupting him…
cillian looks like he is actually enjoying this
oh my god
An endearing interview with earnest questions for each other.   Was also great seeing Margot's love for Emily Blunt! Haha!
You can see and hear that Cilian is uncomfortable when talking about himself or when people praise him. Such a humble and down to earth guy.
Obsessed w Cillian, obsessed w Margot. This was needed hahaa
9:36 meme
Love that their stylists put them in colors fitting to the tones of their respective films
I love Margot being literally all of us and praising Cillian and his work 😂
I wanted so badly for Cillian to break into Tommy Shelby voice 😂
Can we all agree Barbenheimer is the best moment in cinema of the year ?
Margot begging for the Peaky Blinders movie is amazing, I feel so seen
When my two personalities meet
I didn't realise just how intelligent and business savvy Margot was. She's obviously a true force to the industry and I think her biggest days are ahead
The release of this video feels like the release of Barbie & Oppenheimer all over again. So much excitement!! 👌🏽😎😄💖💣💥
🔥🔥🔥
Thank you very much for this
she’s so smart i love her
Barbienheimer!💥🧡🙏
I’m just now discovering this series. What a great idea, and a great pairing.
Margot is great, so enthusiastic and knowledgeable. Cillian is much more your classic tortured artist, not at all in a bad way
I’m surprised they got Cilian to do this
now we need greta and nolan doing this
Can we just award her with most elegant creature on the planet? From Feet to Head 😅
This  was excellent
Both of them did great job in both of their films.  Robbie really brought realism and rawness in Oppenheimer. And cilliian totally stole every scene he was in his film Barbie. Bravo vince 🎉
Props to the crew on this. If I had to go to work and look at two people this attractive all day, I'm not sure I could function.
the best crossover so far hahaha
it was boring movie
Barbinheimer
they are so nice and themselves, very good video. watched it like it was only 5 min long
Wont lie them two look so good together Great match up  They should do next Nolan film together or might be a nice action adventure set in early 19th century
what an incredible interview!  Margot talks a lot which makes up for the little that Cillian says, even though she sometimes interrupts him hahaha
What a fascinating interview. Did not plan to watch the whole thing in one sitting, but their chemistry and interaction was great. Have seen "Oppenheimer" but not yet "Barbie," something I will have to change after this.
We want Jim Carrey and Rowan Atkinson - actor on actor
I never thought an Australian and a British would save the cinema this year.
Cillian talking about reading energetic imprints in Oppenheimer's former home. A++
subtítulos en español por favor
It would have been great if we saw a face off between Cillian Murphy and Ryan Gosling!!
I love Margot, but I do think she could have let him talk a little bit more 😢
Such a great, open and honest interview. Good questions and equally good answers. Also nice hearing their real-life personal accents instead of the american imitation
both great movies, and two great actors. and netizens have done good for the marketing for both too. hope it will happen in the future like this, we need more love in the world, rather than division. this show us that everything got a place in the world.
Agree, there are 2 kind of people and im in the same boat as Margot
"Every Wednesday?" That was Tommt Shelby asking😂
🙌👍
They done got the Barbie/Oppneheimer crossover
Barbenheimer: The Bikini Atol is gonna be HUGE!!
This conversation is 90% Barbie and 10% Oppenheimer I wish cillian talked more
Both of their films really made me excited for cinema again. Two incredibly talented people just having a chat.
Two amazing actors.
Fastest 50 minute interview ever
This is the most unexpected expected video ever
Margot speaks for literally millions of us when she says: “of course there’s more story to tell…please, do it…”
She doesn't let him speak. Everytime he forms a coherent thought she interrupts him with vaccuous conversation filler. Calm down woman! I get you are excited, but it's his moment too! We want to hear him speak! No matter how much I forward it or go back, the entire interview is just Margot's relentless throaty mumbling.
Both of them have a similiar face shape xD
"Mattel was AMAZING to let us do this" means "Mattel was DESPERATE to let us do this."
Could listen to them talk for years and it wouldn’t get boring
Barbie is junk
Hopefully not the last time🖤💖
I love that Margot went completely fan girl and she did it in such a disarming way ❤
I can't believe they seriously discuss such a silliness like Barbie movie and any kind of preparation for it, and that Margot tweets all this non-sense instead of listening to a true theater actor.
Thank you Margot for asking him about Peaky fuuk*ng blinders 😊
So damn Lovely ❤️ They need to be in a film for sure. And i love that Margot is a fan of peaky blinders
just rename the video title to bipanic
my fucking roman empire
Barbie was woke and trash
Perfect. Now give me a movie with those two.
Love both margo&cillian as actors didnt know they would be this amazing together,more please...💜
Christopher Nolan doesn’t have a phone. That’s my takeaway from this interview
Margot Robbie’s beauty is really the least interesting thing about her. What an idol.
thanks for making me feel alive
Margo is so likable and smart!
This is the interview i didnt know i needed🩷🖤
i love this....
Barbenheimer: The Interview
Scarecrow and Harley Quinn !!!
Would love to see both of them on a movie!!  Loved Barbenheimmer! 🩷🖤
I admire and love both Margot & Cillian. This is most interesting. Notable is the mention of both directors wearing the same suit to work daily. I have made a decision of the same. To have a uniform leaves brain space for more pressing tasks, adding that you will be comfortable always.
I love the interview but Margot is always interrupting Cillian. I know that she was excited to talk with him but I wish she would just let him talk cause he is very relaxed here lol
Barbenheimer is real.
So much deep respect between the two of them.
These TWO I shrieked when I saw this!
I love margot but I wish she let cillian talk. She kept on talking over him, like she’d ask him questions but she won’t actually let him finish before she interrupts with her own stories. Kinda bugged me the whole time while I watched.
Cillian!! 😍
wow i learned a lot
Barbenheimer Forever!!!
"Yeah, Yeah, yeah, yeah" ...Cillian murphy 2023
Hi Barbie Hi Oppie
When the color pink meets black
What a smooth interview i loved how they interviewed each other
Imagine if Cillian started the interview with "Hi Barbie!" 💗💗💖💗💗💖💗
the sheer POWER these tow hold, insane.
I'm half way through this conversation and not once was the sociopolitical impact on these films mentioned. Maybe this is a good think with actors.
Both incredible
LOVED IT
barbenheimer came true
https://youtu.be/PbfCaJUpVL0?si=PYd04SrvfSEgNNq5
Oppenheimer>>>>>>>pink BS
It's so rare to see Cillian Murphy enjoying an interview and I am all in for it.
Peaky Blinders baby!
Anyone know the name of the podcast ?
They make a good couple..
❤
Did it not build such hype because the internet took pleasure in upsetting Tom Cruise?
Dr. Jonathan Crane and Dr. Harleen Quinzel just met. Such a delight!
There is a lot of tension/organic chemistry created by their opposing personalities. A movie together would be great.  It is also nice to see Cillian engaged from the start. He laughed a lot at Margot's silliness. Good job on requesting Variety to pair up with Margot for this. It is perfect.
Margot is going to make Barbie 2 and it's going to feature evil Ken, played by Cillian Murphy.
Definitely feels like there's some chemistry there! (I know they're both married and am not implying anything other than a flirty energy.) Would be great to see Barbieheimer actually happen in another movie!
Margot Robbie enforcing "Pink Wednesdays" is the kind of energy I'm bringing to my next team meeting. "Sorry, Jim, no tie, no Zoom link."
Cillian Murphy talks about Oppenheimer with the same intensity he probably orders coffee with. "I'll take a latte... with the fate of physics as we know it"
Please get him some contacts im literally shaking
2 of my favourite actors
Barbenheimer moment! Loved that era in summer!
I was crying when I saw this video haha ​​I'm so proud of them. They're amazing
Barbenheimer!!
Not the video I was expecting with this title but still enjoyed it nonetheless
Never before was I so excited about an interview! What a dream pairing. ❤
It's Dr. Jonathan Crane and Dr. Harleen Quinzel everybody!
Shoutout to Margot for begging Cillian to say yes to a peaky blinders spinoff
I feel like that fact about the space between the soft and hard palate between respective nationalities is utter tripe. I looked it up and cannot see a single thing about it. Also, cannot necessarily see why there'd be any evolutionary selective pressure for this trait.
What a great conversation, but I laughed at 23:33. Cillian is like, that's horrible.
The chemistry. Wow. I need a drama/romance, not rom-com, with these two. Like now.
lovely cill murghy
I love them both so much, and yes, the world totally needs a spin-off Peaky Blinders movie. And a Barbie sequel, too.
Cillian Murphy doesn’t age at all
barbenheimer weekend was the busiest my cinema has been in for YEARS. i worked 27 hours and did 82k steps over the friday-sunday XD
Bittch keeps interrupting Cillian
The first real return year of normal cinema after C19, the two biggest movies, released on the same date, with the two lead actors from each. Just THAT is incredible, but they also happen to be such interesting individuals, where it doesn’t even feel like an interview format or forced, just felt like two old friends chatting, completely unbothered by the competition of the biggest movies of their lives coming out…on the same day! And the convo just naturally flows. A historical pairing for this great concept, for sure. Not just great people, but an example of how we should all be to each other. Life isn’t about winning - it’s the journey & who you meet along the way. Well done Variety, Margot and Cillian. 👏 ❤
Okay, but like, I need a movie of them paired up together ASAP  It can be romance, comedy, drama, action, etc. I just need a movie of them 🥹
Batman Villains
Literally skimmed the whole video to get to minute 43 when Margot begs Cillian to talk Tommy Shelby and the Peaky Blinders
Seeing cillian met margot like,was a dream,like,real exploded bomb,like, the Real Combination,real ship ,i mean ,this is like a dream movie for The film and their acting for their love of Theater 😭
Barbie is cinematic fluff, to be quickly forgotten beyond 9yr olds. Oppenheimer was an exceptionally well executed story. The only thing in common is the release date. Taking 10 minutes describing where Margot found the character of Barbie is completely pretentious.
For a talk between Scarecrow and Harley I thought they'd bring up their psych education more
She keeps cutting him off though.
Wow Margot Robbie looks magnificent in the thumbnail 🫢
Something like this will never happen again in our lifetime
Love Margot but not enough Cillian in this
It's refreshing to see renowned actors employing a similar, relatable preparation process. Especially their use of YouTube and Wikipedia, hits close to home.
she doesn't let him speak
Flirty ending. You can tell Margot really loves talking with Murphy. I watched her talk with Jake and she seemed much more indifferent. Murphy seemed slightly surprised at her youthful crush on him. Cute!   I wonder if Margot and her husband have an open marriage. 😂
https://youtube.com/@55thomas88?si=pzvSjPek6wT9yBVX
This may be like... the best video on youtube
Narcisstic person on narcisst
First time in my life watched an entire 48 minutes long video
Margo: talking and talking and talking Cillian: yeah-yea-yeah-yea-yeah :D
She was brilliant at it.
RAIN .
SHE WAS SUNSHINE HE WAS MIDNIGHT .
I love how Margot is Barbie but out of the both of them, Cillian is the most doll looking
Thought this would get more views, then i thought ow yeahh... gta 6 trailer is out now.
It’s crazy how despite it feeling like a flash in the pan, internet trend barbenheimer is still going strong as a concept nearly 5 months later. This will forever be a part of both of these movies legacies.
The couth of Cilian >>>>
Fookin yes - finally - a celebrity at a calibre like Margot Robbie fan-girling about Peaky Blinders infront of Cillian Murphy and even saying 'TOmmy Fookin Shelby' - just yes come on
You can really tell she's in awe
Harley and Dr Crane. That’s all I see here. I ain’t mad at it.
Great interview, even though I did not enjoy neither of those films it was cool seeing them interract like that.
I like this interview format
SAW CILLIAN MURPHY IMMEDIATELY CLICKED
SHES SO REAL FOR MENTIONING PEAKY BLINDERS
Love these two
Very interesting.. Wowww..
Their eyes are to die for
Illuminati…..
The crossover interview of 2023  no one expected !!🤩
where we discover that two very talented artists are also extraordinary people, perfectionists, intelligent and also curious about work and life in general. thank you very much Variety for this wonder
The person who paired them up deserves a raise
Never forget God loves you and is our lord and savior
Best pair of the show!!!!❤❤
This is not what i wanted to watch when i saw those names and then the title "Actors on Actors"
What!!! Cilian smiling and enjoying himself for the whole interview... Really rare😅🎉🎉
Variety it’s December 6th where’s the Emily and Anne video?😭
Let.. him.. speak PLEASE!
LOVE YOU !!!!!!!!! <3 ❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥
Scarecrow meets Harley Quinn.
ugh i love seeing girls who’s very passionate about their job
ugh i love seeing girls who’s very passionate about their job
One of these actors loves talking about themselves, the other would prefer to talk about literally anything else. So one of them is asking questions and listening to the answer, and the other is asking questions, interrupting the answer, and directing the conversation back to herself at every opportunity. I hate that this woman has become some kind of icon for feminism in film.
This interview was something I didn't know I really wanted to see🙀 Both are a-ma-z-i-n-g actors, I think it's very interesting how they prepare for their roles. Also love the thumbnail 😻
John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
i loved this so much
It would have been nice if Margot "Like" Robbie had interrupted less.
You have got to get these two to play some kind of lead movie together.
To the cutter of this video: Put the Voice isolation not so high. It sounds not so good then.
8:51 no one’s itching for greta gerwigs movie cmon🤦🏻‍♂️
Watching this interview even though I haven't seen either film 💀💀
Babenheimer. I need them back. I congratulate the one who paired these two brilliant people, thank you very much. Their movies blew and they were also amazing. I really hope that these two win an oscar for their brilliant performances, they deserve it a lot. ❤
Aw having trouble. Take a seat, have a drink. You look like a man who takes himself too serious.  Do you want my opinion? You need to lighten up.  🔥
37:55 clocked him with “do you know that reference from mean girls?” girl that man didnt know what a meme was 😭
Saying "they (the writer) did not know where it was going sounds unbelieveble, because isn't it the first thing a writer sets out, like the core of the story in one line. Also refered to as logline? Hard to believe that Noha B. would work like that...  But maybe it is true...?
Hi Margot, Hi Cillian, hope ya all doing great!   @Cillian: I hope that I am wrong with the following. But please do yourself a favor and go to a doctor check yourself, because u might be ill - Parkinson!
two very commercial folks, y would i even care about that lol
bisexuals everywhere rejoiced
they made my summer 2023 everyone say thank you margot robbie and cillian murphy!
UGH. So good. They knew the Barbenheimer thing was organic and they know it's never going to be replicated and I love that they were in the middle of it. And getting to see the process of how Nolan and Gerwig direct, through their eyes... that was so fascinating. I hope we see them in a movie together one day, I think Margot would kill it in a Nolan movie with all his usual suspects like Cillian.
Margot is far from a great actress and Barbie....well i will say no more on that SMH. Cillian ...now this man is a great actor.............films etc speak for themselves. Wokeness will die eventually.
Dont watch this the title is misleading. I thought i could get to see an actor on top of another actor. What a scam!
What a great pairing.
Is this me or is Margot acting a bit here?
Am I crazy or they have a family in an alternate universe
Everyone associates these two because of Barbenheimer, but people don't talk about how they're co-workers in Arkham Asylum. Scarecrow is technically Harley's boss
Why she is that much beautiful ❤️❤️
this + halle & rachel's upcoming interviews are my joker i'm so serious
he doesn't give a flying fuck
20:10 she’s so honest lol love her
I purely love both of them but why did Margot never let Cillian finish his thought, alway interrupting him :(((((
Read the title n thought this was a porno 😂
Margot has the gracefulness of Barbie irl!! Or maybe, Barbie has Margot's
oh god, where are the timestamps TTTT I need them so bad
Перевод на русский бы, блин..
47:55 what a meme material lmao
Love them both. Saw Barbie in theaters cus I have girls. Enjoyed it. Bought Oppenheimer at home cus couldn't get to theater 😢 loved it.
Imagine if they pair Emily Blunt and Margot Robbie, they will be so chatty 😅
"I do know what a meme is." by Cillian Murphy.  Truly one of the sentences of all time.
This is so satisfying to listen this sort of interviews So calming 🥰 and Cillian is just 😇🥰
its  so hard to watch people being unauthentic in an interview
Both are different quality movies but both are my favourite movies. ❤❤❤❤💯
my two personality talking to eachother :
But its like the color pink was made for her, right?
Margot is so charismatic and brilliant, and Cillian Murphy is a pleasure to watch 🤎
Margot wearing Barbie and the Rockers jacket 💗
She interrupted him too often!
Best 48 minutes on the internet today. Love you both <3
感觉这会成为播放量最高的一集哈哈哈，芭比海默应该被载入历史
I WANT TO SEE COLIN QUINN AND MARC MARON
43:13 they talk of Tommy fokin Shelby!!
She should practice being a better listener , she keeps cutting in , let the man finish!
I know he’s Irish but he sounded more British at the start of the interview. The more he got comfortable, the more the Irish came out
50 mins of Cillian Murphy interview?  Hell Yea!!!
all I heard was greta
Her husband is such a lucky man good lord what a catch! Insane talent + great personality, intelligence and god tier beauty
This is so satisfying to listen this sort of interviews So calming 🥰 and Cillian is just 😇🥰

te amo cilliannn
Her fake tan faded on just her hands is so relatable
Does anyone know what podcast episode Greta showed Margot?
screaming at how wonderful this is
Margot Robbie is so pure
Two of my best people in the world, such a joy to watch them both🤩 ❤
BARBENHEIMER!!!!
BEST ACTRESS and BEST ACTOR Y'ALL!
they’re gonna smash.
Ryan Gosling was so good in barbie , dude literally stole the show
2 increibles actores ❤❤
there may be no sequels to their films, but I need a sequel of this duo being a fan of each other. THIS WAS SO GOOOD!
As much as I'm trying not to see it, this to me is watching Tommy Shelby interviewing Barbie
This is gold, you can tell Cillian is so impress with Margot.
Next we need chris Hemsworth and jason momoa...what you guys say?
Cillian and his team are geniuses for coming up with this duo. I’ve never seen him so invested in an interview before. The dynamic between these two is amazing and you can really tell they’re well endowed in there crafts. I wish this interview was longer.
Two brilliantly intelligent and talented actors! Can’t wait to see what comes from them in the future.
This was awesome
U look amazing❤❤❤❤😊
Such a wholesome conversation ❤
cillian🥵
This is going to blow up the internet
Nice work on this video. Both are great actors!
love how Cillian patiently listens, empathizes, allows the other person time to think & speak, whereas Margot tries to finish their sentences, guides the conversation and directs the person towards an answer. Radiates who they are within.
I came for cillian murphy but she dosent let him talk 🫤🫤🫤
Interesting pairing energetically- like puppy versus senior cat
these two! 🥺🤍
Can we get Dylan O’Brien in one of these, because I want to know how he would interact with someone he could be paired with.
Most people see Barbie and Oppenheimer, I see the Scarecrow and Harley Quinn.
Biggest piece of shit ever Barbie... Greatest movie of de decade Oppie....
Man they should be on a movie together
Barbenheimer: best meme in 2023😂😂😂
Does anyone know cilian boots id?
Need more Cillian interviews 😢
Margot is so so charming, every girl feels the same when she speaks about Cillian and Peaky Blinders
I loved every second of this interview.
Random question - why do they change the colour of Margot’s clothes in the thumbnail of this video? It’s all the more strange considering that the reason she is in this video is because of the whole Barbie/Oppenheimer thing.
Finallyyyy
HI Barbie  👋😃
Morgot is dayum talkative lady and our young boy cillian is an elite ambivert- i would want cillian to talk more but the thing’s done.
Both are wonderful. 💖🖤
fans asked, variety answered
Nothing special to make the choice. Two movies with the most hype
Barbenheimer is back!
scarecrow and harley quinn😭
Ahhh Amazing!
I did the Barbenheimer movie day. It was the first time in my life I decided to watch 2 very different movies back-to-back and honestly it was amazing. I watched Barbie first and then Openheimer. I wore pink and everything, it was like an event. We as a society need good original movies back and these two proved it could be done. No more unnecessesary remakes and sequels, please!
i was waiting for him to say by the order of the peaky blinders lol
I don’t see the hype regarding Margo Robbie “beauty” just blonde with blue eyes and slightly masculine look which I guess is European beauty standards
Imagine Them together in a movie... I'd love thattt
Scarecrow and Harley Quinn in the same room? Yes, POINTS!!!
Wow their chemistry is insane. Let them do movie together
*The Barbenheimer Interview*
I will never understand why Barbie did so well.🤷‍♀️ It was just ok
Margot might be the most beautiful person ever
Margot didn’t do one good movie thus far, she is just a good looking woman
She is TOO perfect looking, simply the best possible choice for Barbie.
This is just such a good combination
Yo tampoco tenía esa voz introspectiva hasta que vi la serie Heroes. Tendría unos 15 años. Recuerdo que me quedé super pillada con la escena donde el niño lee la mente a un tipo en el cajero automático. Me giré hacia mi madre y le pregunté si ella también se hablaba a sí misma y me respondió que sí como si fuera lo más obvio del mundo. Para mí fue como si me hubieran golpeado con un cazo, diciéndome “no eres normal!” (y ya había tenido esa sensación antes, así que fue peor). Desde ese día me forcé a hablar conmigo misma como si estuviera teniendo una conversación, o practicando lo que iba a decir. No sé cómo es la voz introspectiva de los demás pero la mía se parece mucho a alguien escribiendo un libro. Incluso pienso “y entonces se levantó para ir a blablabla” y luego hago el diálogo. Sinceramente, era más feliz sin esa voz 😂😂
Her husband is a freaking nobody looser
What a great job they did together...it was a real pleasure ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
She really is beautiful
there should be a movie about ken next
Aaaag now I need them both on a movie please!
Both of them are so inspiring ! I'm so happy Margot is talking about the production process of Barbie. I feel so many people were so unhappy with this movie (how not feminist it is, how matel was just there to make money, etc). She's so smart and sweet like such a great person ! And Cillian !! I had no idea he only started acting at 20, real proof there's no age to start something 💜💜
This is perfect
the kind of dumb people in america barbie should have grossed more than avatar
Their outfits match their movies
Too innocent brats.
I now need a movie with them. Their energies play off each other so well, her energetic enthusiasm and his calm introspective vibe.
❤❤
Ladies and gentlemen, these are the two biggest stars of 2023. Two phenomenal actors and artists who blessed the world with a phenomenon like Barbenheimer. It was literally a cultural moment.
This is riveting. I just love how much Margot clearly is so passionate about the process and her being a wonderfully talented person and as a fellow Aussie makes us all proud.
how is cillian only 47
Let's clarify something: - Many people wanted to see Oppenheimer for the Christopher Nolan experience.  - No person went to Barbie for the Greta Gerwig experience - they just wanted to obviously see highly successful and iconic toy depicted on screen - If they did exclusively want to see a Greta Gerwig film - maybe like 10 people would have seen it
Finally!! Now cast them into a romantic movie
the sound quality on this thing is bonkers
Yeah these are definitely the therapy  sessions. It in a good way.
11:32 'I try to avoid lookin at myself' if even Cilian feels that way how r we supposed to like seeing ourselves lmaoo
barbie sucked soooo bad, Oppenheimer was so epic, case in point
i remember the theaters when barbenheimer premiered it was so fun <3
Margots knowledge as a producer is really showing here. She‘s showing how she’s single handedly saw her own potential very early and carved out a career for herself. Well done
someone pointed out how often he says "yeah" as a reaction and now i can't ignore it
Such a great interview 🤩
This was fantastic.
They should make a movie together, it would be amazing
Thank you Variety. 🙏🏽
yeah it's all good and cinema won and all that but deep down film wise...oppenheimer is masterful in every feasible way...barbie was always going to make bank...but for oppenheimer to be such a complex, dialogue heavy 3hr b/w political drama AND THEN on top of that cash in 950mil is unmatched, and tbh, ofc Cillian and Downey and everyone in it hit home but, if it was not for Nolan...the film wouldn't have achieved such feat, consequently that incredible story wud not have had the kind of impact it did in cinema and in the world in general which was paramount imo
margot is such an icon, barbie couldn't have asked for a better producer
This is perfect. I love this interview so much
Best part when margot talking about peaky blinders
Hear you go hot-wheels good luck if you really like a challenge.
That's Thomas fookin' Shelby..
I love Margot 😭
loved this!!!
Whoever paired these 2 together deserves not just a raise but a medal. He's usually so bored during interviews lol. Love this so much. And the way the cast of each of these films supporting each other even though they were so different...love it
The natural and organic nature of this sit down was very refreshing.
This was so cool, except they kept talking about Barbie.
My two favorite actors 🥹 together 🥹 this is amazing
this has become my roman empire
two amazing films. such a joy to watch this
I just see this as Harley meeting Scarecrow.
the title of this video is way too sexual to not be sexual
A black cat and a golden retriever 😂
Dude anyone else hear her Harley Quinn accent creep in sometimes
Barbenheimer took over summer and now winter too ig 😆
I sat down to put this on the other monitor while i worked late. Needless to say i just watched the entire thing without touching my keyboard. Craft demands attention and these two have so much of it.
The besting acting they have done is to be interested in each other's stories....
This conversation was so refreshing and I’m not quite sure why. Their chemistry is real and I would love to see them in a movie together. Both of them are such talented individuals
This is the duo that we never knew we needed and are so glad we got. I would love to see a movie with these two as the stars
The fact that multiple people were literally dressing up as Robert Oppenheimer in 2023 is something I still can't wrap my head around. lol
I was absolutely infatuated with this sudden video of these two paring up for an interview! And much like their movies they actually ironically compliment each other extremely well. Also I almost screamed when Margot asked Cillian about Peaky Blinders. I love that series and Thomas Shelby so freakin much, so thank you Margot!
Such a nice relaxing talk. Thanks everyone for the opportunity to see it!
I wish this was a 2 hour long talk show. Would have still loved it!
there's a difference in mouth spaces?
😘Solo estoy aquí por cillian Murphy  y creo que soy la única comentando en español 😔
love how margot keeps cutting of cillian in this interview ahhahhaha
You gotta acknowledge the meme's contributions
barbenheimer solidified them both as some of my favourite actors as of right now! ive watched much more of both of their filmographies since and it actually got me into liking movies when previously i never had any interest and couldn’t sit through 2 hours of film uninterrupted. great and surprisingly cerebral interview, so happy that i could be part of the celebration of the plethora talent in the entertainment industry this year, not just in their movies but in so many other releases that i wouldve missed if it weren’t for them ❤
CILLIAN <3
If you met Cilian Murphy and didn't ask him about Peaky Blinders, you'd be fumbling.... obviously Barbie Margot did not fumble
They've both played batman villians😂
I cant believe we actually got OPPENHEIMER AND BARBIE IN THE SAME ROOM 🔥🔥🔥
They should do a movie together How many of you want them
6 years to produce Barbie! Wow what an achievement and testament that success takes time and dedication!
Omg I've never seen Cillian not bored!!! Bt then again when u have a gorgeous, intelligent AND charming bombshell who dafuq wudnt be mesmerised lol
the crossover we didn't ask for but needed
9:33 LMFAOO he’s proving himself🙏 god bless ‘him
The last 5 minutes were ❤
she's just like me, Cillian's biggest fan, it's adorable.
Everything comes out of Cillian's discourse is so fluent and natural, and Margot just followed him like a flow as well.
I love cillian Murphy and Margot Robbie 🥰
I love the barbenheimer franchise ❤️‍🔥
What a combo
Cillian Murphy has such a wonderful voice and face. He is an incredibly careful, detailed and intense performer, don’t get me wrong, but he has such an expressive face and such a booming low voice, great tools for an actor.
cool
36:55 "You know how I saw it?"  Cillian: "No"
Two of the greatest talents of all time. So glad for their success this year.
They would be a great couple
Holy fucking shit this is what i need in my life
cute!
is it just me or are the mics on this one pretty muffled? Either way cool video. great actors
BARBENHEIMERRR
Tah ieuu nu didagoaan teh..
Didnt like his Character on Red Eye🤣 but a talented actor!
I'd love to see her play Cat Woman.
I had Oppenheimer tickets booked for the opening weekend (no offense, Barbie was planned for weekend after). Only to find out an hour before that my session was cancelled and replaced by a Baribue movie! 😂 will forever not forget the cinema manager who made the call 😂😂  Hello from Perth WA
Scarecrow vs. Harley Quinn
Margot is so delightful, Cillian just blows my mind that he portrayed such a chainsmoker 😅
i have a lot to say but.. love it. that's it.
Love them both.  Been a fan of Murphy since 2003 ,  28 days later. Then disco pigs, wind that shakes the barley, all the nolan films, breakfast on pluto, peaky plinders , etc. so happy he is getting rewarded and honored with Oppenheimer. So excited to see what lead roles he gets to do next.
imagine these two as a couple....
Literally Barbenheimer.
Let’s be honest  movie Oppenheimer is 100 Barbie is 5 🤷🏻
Margot is so loveable 😊
BHAHAHA she asked about Thomas Shelby 💀💀 fangirl is showing
THE FACT THE FANS OF THEIR FANDOMS ARE LITERAL ENEMIES BUT THEY ARE ENDING FANWARS
Genuinely feel like I am at a dinner table with them
The BEST part of all this is when we got to see what a Peaky Blinder fan she is! Wasn't expecting that at all, just amazing! Im so glad Cillian is finally getting the recognition he deserves, one of the greatest actors of our time. AND OMG:   GOD BLESS MARGO! FOR SAYING "CAN WE TALK ABOUT TOMMY FOOKIN' SHELBY!"  AND SECOND OF ALL THANK GOD SHE WAS PRACTICALLY BEGGING HIM TO DO A PEAKY BLINDERS MOVIE! SHE OBVIOUSLY KNOWS WHAT THE FANS ARE HOPING FOR. THANK YOU MARGOT, HOPEFULLY YOU WILL GET THE PEAKY BLINDERS MOVIE IN MOTION!👏👏🫶🤗
Ending fanwars ❤
wtfuck margot just said the “us mothers stand still…” line and just like that i teared up
Love love love these two ♥️✨ they made cinema fans become Allie’s for two different movies at the same time.
Wow, these are some attractive people lol
Cillian still can't relax. It is not in his nature. Great interview though.
So we'll be waiting Cill💌
This is the best pairing yet
"I also love your sleep story on the calm app" yes! The best 😂
This video itself is a proof that people aren’t done with this paring, Almost 2 mil views in less than 2 days, we aren’t done with barbieheimer. I’d love to see this 2 in the same movie together, can you imagine !
Margot i LoVe you... I really do....but plzzzz let him talk! 🙂🙂 don't have to tell your story in between of his Every Fooking sentence!!
This was a really insightful conversation! It’s cool to get a kind of debrief of the Barbenheimer phenomenon by the stars themselves. And it was also great to learn more about the behind the scenes and both of their processes.
Margot seems like such a student of the game. Will be very interesting to see the work she produces over the next 10-20 years
26:35 Did she just imply a 200% anatomical difference in palate space between Aussie and Americans? That's just absolute fucking nonsense...
It’s cool that thanks to Killian and Margot’s openness, they had a very sincere and friendly conversation!🥰
15:57 Man said a handwritten letter, what happened to email?
They probably didn't even write Barbie.
a barbie sequel with Cillian would be perfect.
Have you seen her before pictures? I only like her because she produced saltburn.
i love how excited margot is to be speaking with cillian and i love how much cillian enjoyed speaking with her. they’re both so so amazing! i rarely LOVE actors, but these two are an exception, i love them both so much <3
Both their movies are boring.
does anyone know what podcast is that margot’s referring to? i’d really love to listen to it
The way Margot talks about producing and Greta really makes me think she’d be a great director one day. She has such a good grasp on the mechanics of movies and she just seems like she’d be able to make something really interesting that I’d 100% love
Ayy the stars of the summer 😎🔥
two of my favorite people in one video, just wow 💗💗
Margot was so excited. lol
I am proud of you Cillian! I am a fan who has loved and supported you ever since you had just started acting and has only been in a couple of movies, so seeing you grow, become a better actor, and now getting the attention you finally deserve, just is indescribable and makes me so happy. You are not just a celebrity whom I love, you are the very inspiration and motivation that got me through though times. Because of you, I am now dreaming to become an actor or a movie director, which I would've never thought of without you. I love you Cillian, I am so proud of you. I will be next to you, supporting you until the end of the line and I really hope to meet you someday, as a fellow actor or even a movie director. I really hope you do get the Oscar though, even if I know that you don't want even more fame or attention, because you deserve it. I don't really want you to get an Oscar too, to be honest, I don't want you to be a very very famous actor that everyone like because it would just make you tired. I want you to stay as my favorite actor, not everyone's favorite actor to be honest 🙂 Anyways, congrats on your big hit, I am truly glad that you are finally getting the attention you deserve, you are amazing. I can't wait for your speech at the Oscars!
I hadn’t gone to a movie in years and I went to watch Oppenheimer. I would go and watch movies but there’s so many unoriginal works, lots of propaganda as well that I just don’t enjoy. Oppenheimer was a great movie, thought provoking.
Now i want them both in movie
My dad thought Barbenheimer was one movie so....
Both movies were great but that had nothing to do with my they were paired together. The internet found it funny that that two polar opposite movies so dramatically different from each other were coming out on the same day. That grew massively!! And yeah, it's an amazing accomplishment. But it didn't happen because the movies were good. It happened because it was a funny scenario. A bright pink Barbie movie and a partly black and white drama about the making of the atomic bomb. 🤣🤣🤣
Their work is so interesting, such a new world to me
It's always lovely to see Cillian embrace the Boomer Dad energy
I love the two of them, we know Cillian and Nolan are phenomonal but I really have such immense appreciation for Greta and Margot's work ethic, professionalism, artistry and creativity. The more I think about  and watch Barbie, the more I adore it's entertainment but also humanity, fun and emotion. Gosling is hilarious but Margot made me cry and fall in love with Barbie's optimism, vulnerability and strength.
2 Barbies
actors on actors is a sus name
Can I marry him
That was actually a really decent conversation with some great insights into the movie business. Love both of them.
love both of them
ыsuch a great experience with this video!
Scarecrow and Harley quinn plotting against Batman.
This video is a treat to our eyes
omg it's oppenheimer and barbie
I love peaky blinder series !
The Media: "Barbenheimer saved the movie industry!" Also the Media: "MCU this! MCU that!"
TIL margot was a producer for the film
thankyou margot for asking cillian about peaky blinders
Sounds so stupid
Give us now Gerwig and nolan in directors on directors
As Cartman says put a Chick 🧍‍♀ in it and make it Gay 🌈 and Lame 💩! Eww… 🤮
the ultimate perfect jawline interview
God such a lovely pair! And both VERY attractive people! I adore both of them🩷
Cillian continuously trying not to zone out 😅
the two most brilliant and my fav blue eyed people having a chat is just what i needed <3
Cillian congratulating her on her "reasonably" successful movie and then laughing 😂😂😂
god this is awesome
Margot mentioning peaky blinders is golden
Barbie was great movie but oppenheimer is actually one of the best movie of decade
🥹
Every time I see Cillian, I have the feeling that my throat will get slashed or my eyeballs will get gouged out
Is it that rare that a script is written in first person? Cool! Congrats to both brilliant actors on a massive year.
They both knew what they had to do 💅💥
Thank you Variety. This is GOLD
Alguém pra legendar essa obra!??
Look , Margot is beautiful but I think she’s getting carried away with her success - Cillian such class and inclusive as ever letting her take centre and quote ‘mean girls’ -   I just feel something off with her
thank you so much variety
I get Margot’s excitement about meeting Cillian. I would have also talked out of nervousness (not as intelligent as she did) but wished she would have slowed it down to hear more from him and his points of view about pretty much anything. Nevertheless, from July 21st to the BBC sessions Cillian did, up to this interview, I’ve been super happy to have excellent cinema, music, and interviews that lighten my everyday life. Thanks to both. Keep up the excellent work!
This is GOLD
I don’t really watch interviews but this was so good I need another hour of them just talking
Cillian is such a beautiful man. 😍
I don’t know, but by the way she talks and her opinions… Margot is my type of girl friend you know? I love her style, her taste and I would love to hang out and talk to her. She’s amazing
which one uuu chose?    barbier or oppenhiemer?😋😻
you guys did such a good job with the idea, production and editing. thank you!
Barbie is like Eve in the Bible scriptures. Eve was made in God's image in Paradise and she had no sense of right or wrong, good or evil, or shame until she ate the forbidden fruit and gained knowledge, feeling ashamed after disobeying God's word. Margot should have related her Barbie character with Adam and Eve. Because there are many similarities between them.
DID THEY NOT WATCH BARBIE MOVIES 😭
OK, but they're so pretty...
I’ve never heard her actual voice 😱
love Margot
Thank god she said him, we absolutely need a Peaky Blinders movie!!!
BARBENHEIMERRRR
In bugarian language hеr famly name means "slaves"
Did Cillian lost his Irish accent? He's sound too American now
I really like both actors but spefically about Barbie I talked to a couple of women who felt the movie really villainized men and made them look like assholes. I liked the movie and felt it was really well done but I can see where they are coming from
43:30 ❤❤
The best duo are meeting today.
Can anyone tell which episode of "This American life" Margot is referring to?
My two ult hollywood actors in one frame. 😫😭
So the official Barbie and Oppenheimer union, it is.
both of them put so much passion into their crafts i gained like +10 intellectual points just listening to this conversation
we really needed barbenheimer this year and it brought back good movies. cinema is back!
I really thought they wouldn't talk about peaky FUCKING blinders!
Cillian Murphy deserves an Oscar ❤ 🍀🌈
Scarecrow & Harley Quinn
Could have watched hours of that, thank you.
Animal(RHS) = Barbie(LHS)
The Barbenheimer phenomenon was something that cinema lovers needed. I've never seen this many people like I have this July in the past 20 years.....
THE actor and actress of 2023.
I would 100% watch an intense noir film with these two acting as rivals trying to take each other down.
they look so good i'm sorry i haven't been able to get it out of my mind
This was so so good.
GOATs
Cillian Murphy is.. DAVID BOWIE, a Christopher Nolan film
You can tell that Cillian really wants to work with Greta!
They both have a bit of their characters in them. She’s so lively and he’s so reserved.
Oh my man Thank you to my man
Well, I wouldn't miss their movie, that's for sure
I'd go see a Harley and Scarecrow film.
WOAH BARBENHEIMER 2!
"He's a scientist... She is the bomb"
I didn't realise just how intelligent and business savvy Margot was. She's obviously a true force to the industry and I think her biggest days are ahead
I hope the studios take note of this summer and realize they need to stop trying to make money by forcing all of these reboots and remakes. Original ideas are what we want and people will run to the theatre.
Margot seems like such a likeable person
How funny is it watching an interview about 2 American movies, but hearing a British and Australian accent.
I love Cillian Irish accent
Christopher Nolan's next bond movie pairing boom  🖤🩷💥
Excellent interview. I don't normally watch these but wow. Need to have more actors interviewing actors.
As much as I love these both- this interview was painful to watch.
I’ve been trying to put it into words why CGI forces the in the audience to feel so detached and like you don’t care about whether or not the house burns down. Because somethings subliminally in your mind tells you it’s not real. I wish they did stuff more like Oppenheimer and Barbie with real sets and not just completely rely on CGI for everything
This too much sexy
The very intentional choice of wardrobe for both of them just makes this even more perfect.
YES, MARGOT! BEG FOR A PEAKY BLINDERS SPIN OFF PLEASE!!!
god this is so excellent and wonderful
crying, blushing, kicking my feet and sobbing bc how perfect this is omg <33
BARBIENHEIMER 🤟🏻🤟🏻🤟🏻🤟🏻
Yep...this Is cinema
I wish there was more content with modern artists explaining their process. Uncut, not short 3 second snippets. With context. Without an Amazon link attached to it.
I watched the entire interview 🎉
I mean of course they did this
He is such a GREAT listener ❤❤
They acting like nothing happened
No Barbie sequel! Its perfect.
The real life Barbenheimer! 😱
Margot interrupting non stop was very annoying
This is Genius
Having a pretty face isn't acting 😂😂she's literally the same person in every movie just different clothing 😂you was willing to go naked in big movie that's what made her career not talent
BARBENHEIMER was one of the greatest trends ever
31:51 alguien sabe cómo se llama el cap del podcast?
i didnt expect this duo to be this good
Love how Margot talking about the science behind Aussies doing an American accent genuinely impresses Cillian. What a beautiful meeting of the minds.
there's chemistry ❤
Both are kicking themselves on the inside knowing that releasing on the same date snatched revenue
I am gonna come back after the Oscars announce them in Best Actor and Best Actress nominations.
THAT WAS SOOOOO CUTE
We will truly ascend when they're starring in a film together.
It always amazes me how actors have an incredible blind spot for how inane their movies really are/were. First of all, not impressed with Oppenheimer whatsoever. Spectacularly talented cast, lackluster script, and everything bouncing around in time served no actual purpose but to confuse the viewer. There was no reason (and there just usually isn't any)  for the director to break up the flow of a story that way. The reason they do it, is to try to make an otherwise lifeless plot more interesting. I don't like this technique in most movies and it definitely didn't work here. The most unconvincing part of Murphy's Oppenheimer was the way he never seemed to really get pissed off by the way the government betrayed him and belittled his contributions. Was not convinced.  Barbie, on the other hand, almost needs no commentary whatsoever. Why would an adult actually want to SEE a movie like this in the first place? Even Margot Robbie, who has exhibited some depth and talent as an actress in other roles, could not possibly save a wretched, juvenile role such as this. Then again, she's played bombastic, over the top characters before, so I guess that's her chosen career path now. Compare her with another Aussie actress, Naomi Watts, and there is really NO comparison between Robbie's roles and the depths of the women played by Watts, who is a STUNNING actress and has chosen roles with much more depth, purpose and character. Just another day in the fog of Hollyweird, folks.
I didn't know Cillian had so many freckles
How many times did Cillian Murphy say "Yeah" challenge?
Barbenheimer is something that Hollywood would repeatedly try to reproduce but probably never achieve again
I've been waiting for this since the summer! This was so nice to watch to close out the year. Especially after not being able to see these actors discuss their movies during the time they were released due to the strike.
28:25 I love the way she says "thing"
A Ken movie!
Now I am become Barbie in Barbie's world
Her looks are so about to drop
Boys are looking at Margot Robbie. Men are looking at Cillian Murphy
33:12
margot asking about peaky is so real love her for getting the scoop hehe gonna need these two stunning actors to work together
Barbie was one of the most stupid movies I've ever seen. What's funny is the people trying so hard to make it sound like something it's not
Barbie and Oppenheimer. #barbieheimer 😂❤
I cant believe were hyped for 48min interview😂
terima kasih telah mempertemukan mereka❤
In awe. Very inspiring.
margot is way too beautiful 😍
I clicked expecting one on the other...i am utterly disappointed
I'm so pleased for Margot. So wonderful to see her success and taking the reigns in producing over the years.
Margot robbie is a peaky blinder fan. DONE SHE IS THE DEFINITION OF PERFECT.
hoping that they'll have movie together!!!
Gender inverted actors ,woman is a man man is awoman .
They’re both so talented and dreamy 😍
Really enjoyed the whole 45 mins
The amount of intellect, understanding and empathy Margot radiates is insane. Classic case of how most of Hollywood tried to reduce her to this sexy blonde bimbo archetype and she turned it around on her own. Cillian looks like he doesn't hate being in an interview for a change and that says a lot.
Scarecrow and Harley. Everything is Batman!
I didn't know Margot was a producer first and foremost for Barbie. Wow. Really love the questions being asked here, very nuanced and substantive. They're both so seasoned in their crafts.
Oppenheimer is❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Margot has such a sweet voice, I like to listen to it.
They are both Advanced Artificial Intelligence. I'm very serious.
Barbiheimer😂😂😂 together
the meeting of two worlds
Margot interrumpía  mucho a cilian
I will never understand why Margot deleted her social media. She is a goddess
Actually barbie was a flopped  It was a woke movie
this is like a love letter to researchers around the world
She’s so beautiful 😭
I know I needed this but I wasn’t sure how much until it came up… and as soon as they set the tone I felt this was going to be a mesmerizing interview.  These two are at their best game right now and I look forward to their future works. Thanks to the people who make this happen!
My mom never broke the cardinal rule. Kim Grizzle and Kalem and Dani did. In order to traumatize me. They should be best when I break it. Because it is not my rule. I'm not gonna hold sacred the very thing used to ruin my life and mind. That's not my rule.
Margot is so giddy, I love her so much
A Margot Robbie tietando o Cillian Murphy é ótima! A sinergia dessas produções é histórica!
this is literally life changing
Yes I will watch the whole 48 minutes
the Barbie movie was terrible.
@11:35 wow geminis think alike me myself think anything good came out of pandemic is wearing mask not weird anymore.
their eyes are so blue 🥹
she's literally so pretty
Harley quinn & scarecrow
Pink and black 💯 their colour
oppenheimer is so much better than barbe.
i hope margot didn't cut cillian that much but i guess she's just really excited and curious about things 😅
Well, of course prefers being called Barbie on the streets, after all that.  She was still a Barbie it can't be anymore in it though, as usual. She thinks the movie where she acted like a reject to everyone else was brilliant?  Skipping ahead, no Cillian interview, so fail, cya.  👣 Us mothers stand still so that our daughters can see how far they've gone.  Hmm.  Her dad got the woman who went nowhere in life, also.  How far to these daughters go?  I bet they have to be close enough to cry with often. Oh Cillian wanted them to see his in a movie theatre with lots of people around?  Oh, they were proud.  Ohh, ok I see, they're actually just nobody's, unless they're acting like somebody.  Oh, ok, he just has to think he could be a guy like that, if he acts like it.  Well, I guess I don't know who else could play smart, so Scarecrow is worth a shot.  I'll watch it later.  Please allow the purchase of the nice big uncompressed versions they use in the cinema's as downloads, not discs, please.  Your disc copy protection got hacked anyways, but people still don't mind paying.  You look like a few thrown together pixels we're all pretending look like exactly like Brad Pitt, since you obviously have no self respect.  Plus, I got the pro grade monitor and a super duper stereo sound system, so I smoke the theatre's picture and sound quality anyway, as probably many people do.
(commenting before fully watching) i wonder if they recognize the shared release date being one of the biggest catalysts for their success
Greta showing the podcast of the woman who didn’t introspect before to Margot to help her find the Barbie character was a stroke of genius, I’m super impressed
I love Margot, but she didnt let Cilian finish speaking. I wanted to know what Cillians parents thought of the Oppenheimer but she cut him off 😂 But i understand cause it takes Cillian a long time to gather his thoughts to respond....
seated for this
I Barbenheimer’d on the premiere day and it was one of my favorite movie theater experiences. I was so excited for both since the teasers, and was relieved they ended up being great films. It’s nice to see their perspectives and how their passion for the films comes through.
This is my favorite interview ever everrrrrrr. These both artist just humble smart , Margot has this big energy and Cillian has the calm soft , both compliment each other in good way , i wish they work together . Hopefully.   i really enjoyed the interview.
we got the GTA 6 trailer and the barbienheimer collab all in 24 hours. crazy.
Alternate title: Harley Quinn sits down with Thomas Shelby
the sound quality is a disaster
just lovely and so relaxing admits all the chaos on the internet!
These are such a wank.
I expected him to have longer fingers
This is a Joy. Love for Margot and love for Cillian ❤
8:47 the delusion is insane 😭😭 no one's itching for the next Greta Gerwig film lmfaooo
Omg thank YOU Margot, I wanted to hear Cillian talk about Peaky Blinders
I watched both of the movies 🩷🖤 this will be known as a great time for cinema.
Cillian Murphy & Margot Robbie Unveil Hollywood Insights in Exclusive Actors on Actors Interview! #barbenheimer #oppenheimer #barbie #margotrobbie #cillianmurphy https://youtu.be/TeXsYzi_Pd0
Both amazing actors
Seeing Margot and Cillian trying to not look each other in the eye so they don't both fall in love was very entertaining
no one gives af gta 6 trailer released
They have such good harmony  and togetherness in this and it was so natural, I enjoyed them greatly, in each and every aspect. Both great actors, extremely talented, dedicated, very intelligent, well spoken,  so much into what they do and love to do. I am really beyond words after watching this "Actors on Actors" with Cillian and Margot, it was great pleasure and joy, wonderful interview. The idea of them working together on a project, a movie, is actually teasing my mind now after the interview. And why not! Big love and respect for them ❤
I hope someday I can see Margot Robbie's flamingo work
Disappointed, read the title and expected something else
Margot’s smile does something to my spirit she’s so radiant and beautiful
Two fantastic actors discussing the two worst films of the year
Margot mentioning the calm app story… she’s so real for that
Margot is all of us speaking to Cillian. SO glad she asked the peaky blinders question.
They're like my parents but they're also my husband and my wife
So I just recently got into the whole Peaky Blinders binge watching bandwagon. So I have been searching anything with Cillian and this is the first interview that he looks like he is enjoying it. In others he looks like he is annoyed 😅. Glad to see this side of him!
In a world where we are told that movie stars are dying out, and the movie audience doesn't know what it wants.... I just see two genuine movie stars respecting their audience and each other. I think movies may be back
HOLY CRAP VARIETY I hear ACDC one more time I'm getting an AD blocker. Seriously, there were ten add breaks. Like WTF?!
So glad the strike is over, but it almost feels better having waited for this.
Cillian and Margot do have great chemistry. I’d love to see them in an old romance, kind of like Casablanca. Just something different for both of them.
Margot is now 1 on my most favorite actress list   Just because she talked about peaky blinders yaaaaaaa😅😁😊
margot robbie is going through that phase when mel gibson lost his australian accent and started sounding american
Her shoes are Barbie!
Margot Robbie is so real for being obsessed with Tommy Shelby and Peaky Blinders she's literally one of us
I’m loving cillians interest in the Barbie movie 😂
me: has so much schoolworks to do also me: watches the entire video
How may times Cillian Murphy said "YEAH" someone please to count it
3:19 “even you?” That was Tommy.
Wow😮
I will try to see both films after watching this interview.
I have admired her for 100 years
Love love love peaky blinders
barbenheimer  - legendary movie
I know other things need to be talked about but let me say these people are just gorgeous.
Barbie and other interviews should show the world that Margot Robbie is more than just a pretty face. If anything, being pretty is the least of her strengths. The palette talk? That girl about having no introspection? She has so deep a bag that only her beauty which is on the surface is being seen by the world. I would love to sit down and just listen to her talk about anything.
Peds
Cillian ❤is so modest, smart, full of respect... He is so anti star. Not at all full of himself. Incredibly sexy. And I like how both of them listwn to each other. Like really listen. Respectfully. I loved Oppenheimer ❤
Marcos habla un putero y de algo que a nadie le importa
43:21 For Peaky Blinders boys
I'm sorry but Oppenheimer was horrible.
I really hate when someone interrupt Cillian Murphy talk.
What a wonderful conversation this was
Let them make a movie together.  I will watch it.
They both are hard working actors who demonstrate that true actors are artists that use study and preparation to make cinema.
I love how they're both perfectly dressed for the occasion
O
after all the comments Chris Nolan has made about cillians eyes I can't blame him in this interview for avoiding the question "do you like the guy". mightve given Nolan false hope
Barbenheimer will forever be iconic
Bless the team of Variety to make this happen. 💛
Now they need to switch directors. Margot for Christopher Nolan and Cillian for Greta Gerwig
i don'tknow why i feel awkward seeing this interview
That time Scarecrow and Harley Quinn teamed up
cillian murphy has such a lovely voice
Margot is a great interviewer.
Perfection.
2 of the most popular actors right now
Actor on actors: You scratch my back, I'll scratch yours.
wait, Tommy shelby smiles?
A meme within a meme. Beautiful
i can't stop staring at cillian's eyelashes
THANK YOU TO THIS BARBENHEIMER CROSSOVER!
What was the podcast she was talking about with the lady that couldn't go introspective
DUDE OMG
This is Cinema
I wish she'd let him talk without interrupting 😶
❤LOVE 💕 LOVE THEM
should’ve asked her if we’re gonna get a harley and ivy on the big screen ever 🥲😂
I Love ❤️ those two  ☘️ ❤️🇦🇺  🫶🌎
Margot geeking out over Peaky Blinders SHE'S SO ME
What a treat!
“Hopefully not the last time” the rizzzzz
I saw Oppenheimer 7 times at the movies. Would have seen it many more times than that if it was financially possible. A beautiful piece of art. The music and storytelling. No wasted second.
Margot speaks for literally millions of us when she says: “of course there’s more story to tell…please, do it…”
it's so cool hearing how much love Greta has for classic movies/making the Barbie crew watch & study these movies while she studied the rhythm!!
Cillian is a great interviewer lmao
I’ll always have such a crush on cillian
These 2 are such phenomenal actors, I was excited to see them pair up just because they're both legendary, completely forgetting the Barbenheimer pairing
I don’t know who I love more
I didn't know I needed this!!!! In life I'm Margot fangirling Cillian. And, please, could she be any more BEAUTIFUL?? It's almost disturbing to watch 😅. Love them.
Both genuine and comfortable with who they are and their success. No signs of being showy or affected.
This is Dr. Doom. I'm calling it
it's so interesting to hear Margot say she typically avoids/doesn't go for lead roles & prefers supporting! she seems like such a leading lady to me, especially after Barbie
The Barbenheimer I've been waiting for! Merci! 🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤
Tommy 🚬
Margots unabashed praise of Cillian is so real of her. I feel you Margot
J. Robert Oppenheimer 🤠💣💥 and Barbie 👱🏼‍♀️💕💓💝🌺💐🎀🌷👙🐽🎀💄👚🦩🩰👄💖
So this is what he do when he's not making a bomb.
Thxxxx for that🙏🏻💖omg
does anyone knows what the name of the episode of the podcast that Margot talked about at 31:30 about the woman who doesnt have the inner voice in her head??????
Wtf is going on with his face?
Cillian rarely does interviews and it's nice to see him comfortable with Margot discussing their films.
so thankful to have these two care about cinema the way they do
Cillian riendo y hablando fluido???? Dios nos bendijo hoy
This is fascinating. I love hearing about their creative process, playing such ICONS... 🤯
I love you Margot
Both of these movies were destined to do well. I loved Oppenheimer and Barbie wasn't bad. But Obviously Oppenheimer with the cast it had and Christopher Nolan at the wheel and a movie about one of the most important people who ever lived. It was destined for success. I think Barbie was also going to do well because pretty much almost every young girl at Barbie's growing up and probably reconnected with their childhood memories and nostalgia.
Its wild, ive always found Margot Robbie to be extremely beautiful like most people. After this interview i think shes close to perfect. So intelligent, well spoken and seems extremely sweet. It really enhances her beauty, which i didnt think was possible.
Could we please have Greta Gerwig and Christophers Nolan in 'Directors on Directors' ?
YES
❤❤❤❤
nah i need them in a movie fr.
Cillian getting more and more Irish the further into the interview they get is so sweet, clearly he is getting comfortable as they are talking
Thanks for the masterclass
This is absolutely fantastic. Both of these films were such a breath of fresh air. Seeing two massively talented actors just talking about their craft and showing genuine interest in each other’s methods and processes feels like a great privilege, as an audience member.
best actors on actors to date
Barbie and Ken deserve and should be together and meant to be
Margot bringing up Peaky Blinders was everything I've ever wanted.
If there's a Peaky Blinder spinoff movie. Margot Robbie better be in it as a strong woman 🔥🔥🔥
My God…, they’re both beautiful…
The guy who is less into social media will possess greater span of attention and also will be a good listener
Barbie is sexist sexism racist racism disgusting disrespectful shame hurt pain full
I’m completely obsessed with Cillian Murphy
What a great pair. What great actors.
❤😂🎉😢😮😅
This is gold! Someone needs to pair them up ❤
There were so many people talking about Cillian’s “feminine little waist” in Oppenheimer. Wild finding out that was completely on purpose
this was so lovely to watch
Keeping Cillian Murphy talking for a good 50 mins is no easy feat, but this is my fave actors on actors!
You have no idea how happy I am to see you as Barbie  Since you plays as Naomi In the wolf of wall street
The Scarecrow and Harley Quinn😉
ICONIC
I'm glad Margot asked about a Peaky Blinders movie, it's good to know I'm not alone in hoping for more despite loving how it ended 😭
As someone who went to the theater liking both of these actors and proceeding to enjoy both, this interview/conversation makes it all 10x better. Love how humble they both are and how they both are able to find common ground and respect one another.
I once heard Cillian auditioned for Batman like to BE BATMAN. Nolan was impressed and really wanted to cast him in the role but Bale made more sense to the studio. I had already been a huge Cillian fan from Disco Pigs and 28 Days later so i was so pumped to see him as The Scarecrow.  But damn i would pay anything to see him be The Dark Knight...
My GOD they are soooooo HOT  The TENSION...GURL.....😏😏
All we need is less and more meditate
Barbenheimer
Yes
this video, especially the prep part, explains that oshi no ko scene where akane dissects Ai
Incredible conversation! You can tell they are both so passionate about not only acting but also the whole filmmaking process. It’s really awesome to hear Margot talking as a producer as well. I can’t wait to see what she produces next (and hopefully work with Greta again!!)
She asked Cillian Murphy to do a spinoff film of Peaky Blinders.😮
I wish cillian would've talked more - it was more of him interviewing her. Still fun though.
Is this recent? Cillian is aging like a fine wine❤
Run to Jesus!!! If you have defected from God then read these Scriptures: (Lost Sheep, Luke 15:1-7 - Lost Coin, 15:8-10 - Lost Son, 15:11-32 - Rich Man and Lazarus, 16:19-31) Jesus is calling you back home, read His word, believe and repent. Saved by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone!. + The world is racing toward "AMAGEDDON" !!! And people need to get right with the Lord! If you have not read the books of (Daniel chapters 7-12), (Ezekiel chapters 37-39) (Matthew chapters 24:1-51 + 25:1-30), (1 Thessalonians chapters 1-5), (2 Thessalonians chapters1-3) and (Revelation chapters 6-19), now would be a good time. They will explain a lot about what is going on right now!  These books will cover the "Wars" about to come, the Rapture, World judgement, hence the Tribulation and the Great Tribulation! These books will also be the most ominous and scary for the unbelievers and the most exciting and uplifting for those who believe in Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior!...  It is my hope and prayer that people would repent and believe on the Lord Jesus Christ before all these things take place, because it is going to be very, very scary if you do not and you decide to wait and see what happens!... + May the Lord open the eyes of the Blind, in Jesus' name. Amen!
YESSSSSSS
Tommy Fucking Shelby !!!  Margot Robbie I Lover Her She’s The Best 🫶🏼😍🥰
Mi bisexualidad representada en un video
Thank you Margot for asking this  cause I need the spinoff so baaaddd 44:10
Cillian ❤
this is the Barbenheimer epilogue we needed
Oh, this pairing was genius.
this is sooo iconic
Their communication differences are killing me. The way she jumps in and interrupts and adds to while he's talking is coming from a good place, I know, but she keeps doing it when he CLEARLY wants to keep talking and finish his full thought. It's like he's doing an interview and she's having a casual convo
El nivel de detalles de esta producción es impresionante, a tal grado que, a pesar de ser dos cámaras(en la mayoría del tiempo), cambian de planos constantemente; y detalles tan minuciosos que  los micrófonos van en sintonía con el color de la ropa de los protagonistas
both of their voices are so easy on the ears. genuinely like an asmr vid in the best possible
Courtney Young was Margot’s dialect coach, she is the master! Also I hope this interview opens a door for Margot to land a role in the next Nolan film🤞🏼
we had EEAAO last year and now that they're hearing us for barbenheimer
MARGOT LET HIM TALK 😭
Margot Robbie definitely takes over a lot of the conversation, but it seems like just nervous energy on her part since she's obviously a big fan of him and Cillian Murphy seems like such a comfortable introvert that he's happy to let her do most of the talking while also steering the conversation away from himself as much as possible.
These two are at such exciting points in their careers. They've got a lot of wisdom and experience but are still in the thick of it, not old and uncaring lol
they definitely fucked after this
Honestly this was entertaining!
I love how their clothes represent their movie counterparts from bright and pink to dark and black. I don't know if that was intentional but the small little details to this epic crossover is truly astonishing. 💕💥
Margot Robbie fangirling over Peaky Blinders is so real😭
margot fangirling over peaky blinders was the best thing ever tbh
i genuinely liked this video a lot
"Now there's a meme about me not knowing a meme" - greatest line
Margot Robbie using the "inception" analogy for "meme in a meme" to Cillian Murphy is crazy
she needs to somehow fit into the peaky blinders movie !!!!
Exactly exactly I hope too
7:50 he's right. we are all hungry for cinema again! amazing vid
Cillian is so chill and such a good listener, also the fact that this is their first time meeting is amazing cause they really clicked here, amazing chemistry.
milk
What a great interview. 'You know I should, but I really shoulnt, I could but then I couldnt, I did but then','I think I know what you are going to say next','I didnt','Really, wow, thats not what I was expecting you to say'. And everyone is just BEST. 'You know we would skype in and ask, you know, hows it going? And they would say -fuck off!.' 'And Greta's just the best. Sure she took a dump in my shoe once, but she's just the best!'
There's going to be a special combo with these two movies together in the future.  That's literally a marketing opportunity lol I'll be disappointed if they don't act on it
If I see that Jack Daniels commercial one more time...
These two went from being Batman’s villains to main characters in an unlikely double feature
i cried
They never work Together But still Feels like pair who had a successful collaboration😅
Such a surprise pairing with two amazing talents. I absolutely love Cillian, Peaky Blinders is one of my favorites shows and Margot is incredibly humble.
HOLY FUCK Margot ROBBIE is SOOOOOO with usss. she literally took the words out our mouf "u are not aware of the memes is that true" 9:32 "keep doing this" i guess im glad he is not totally blissfully unaware 🤣. Dayummmm Murphy saying side role made me think abt "The Mask" jim carry movie the villian i thought was Murphy But it was Peter Greene JUST BLEW MY MIND like WTF. Margie with the "Tomas Foukin SHELBYYY"
mother and father
Transatlantic dialect was the word he was looking for I think — I loooove this
Lol bless her can tell she’s a little nervous
Thank you for making this happen!!!!! Totally adding Barbenheimer to our holiday lists 🎉
This is amazing in my eyes for two reasons. Margot and Cillian were both in DC Universe properties, and then the viral Barbenheimer moment.
I’m so glad we got to end this year with them both paired up with each other. It’s clear Variety saw us with those Barbenheimer memes all over. Thank you Variety for everything and making this year so so special! <33
Margot is that extrovert that don't let the introvert finish the damn sentence 😅😅😅
I'm dreading whatever the studios are planning to do thinking they can artificially recreate the dueling blockbuster thing that happened here. I just know they're gonna try to replicate barbenheimer in some capacity with two stylistically different movies but it's not gonna work.
Barbenheimer forever 🩷🖤
Kevin Feige hear me out, these two are perfect casting for Dr. Doom and Emma Frost!
This was great 👏
truly brilliant people, we can just tell!
NO WAY
Margot took over the interview with Barbie topics;  I had to fast-forward every time she spoke 😂  More Cillian next time please. He's very interesting.
wait. who is on who again..?🤨🤨
Can we please talk about Tommy fuckin’ Shelby 😭😭🙌
She definitely has a crush on him
This is fascinating
What a duo
Two true professionals. Great work.
My crush,  Cilian. What a lucky girl
If margot just let cillian finish all of his sentences this wouldve been the perfect interview But i forgive her cause she asked about peaky blinders movie
What do you get when a country plays victim ? Hint: the opposite of not real.
may i please see a follow-up of margot pretending to be a flamingo
Imagine if Barbenheimer didn’t happen…
All I notice about this was that Margot is a talker and Cillian a listener
Cillian is like the scientist who's just consumed by the work and is phenomenal at it, while Margot seems more like a CEO who's just very savvy in almost all departments. I'd love to see a movie produced by Margot starring Cillian
It can be easy to deify actors, so I love to see things like this that really humanize the actors: we get to see a bit into how they think and live and compare it to our own lives. IDK if that makes sense, anyway cool interview with two amazing actors
I didn't know she was a producer. Respect. I didn't want to see this film  until I saw packs of women, dressed in pink, going to see it. I appreciated it and the definite statement it made  on the nature of womanhood.
I read that Cillian Murphy’s team wanted to be paired up Margot Robbie, and she agreed. I’m glad that they didn’t have to persuaded to be paired up.
Remove Marvel from the equation for a little while and look what fills it's place!!! Please stop watching marvel, it is directly preventing unique, original films from being produced by taking away budget and actor availability.
I love these two ❤
I appreciate Margot fangirling and being very specific with her questions!
I would pay a subscription service to watch Margo do animal acting.
Cillian's staff was definitely stiff the whole time he was looking at her.
The only reason why the Barbie movie was a success was because it didn't pretend to be something it was not. Take note Disney.
Free Palestine 🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
Mr Shelby reached the gates of Hollywood aye !!!
what margot said about emily blunt is exactly how I feel about her, I would watch anything with margot robbie in it
Margot's joke of a meme inside a meme, an "inception of memes" made me burst out laughing
i love seeing people with the same passions talk about it
Love these two!! ❤❤❤
interview so good i watched it twice back to back
God pls I want Margot
Thank you for this interview I remember was on random me time I choose to marathon those 2 on my own  I choose to watch Oppenheimer first then Barbie right after It was an exciting me time I dont care what people say about taste or whatever I was enjoying those 2 very much Like how these 2 actors respecting each other I respect all kind of taste on cinema Its always fascinating to know the processes behind any movies and these interviews contain very interesting topics  I love the discussion about character prep, accents, character references, shooting in real locations vs in a studio gosh of course cgi is great too but I always loves movie making processes especially behind the scenes of older movies Watching 2 very passionate actors is so refreshing, great work!
Great pairing for this interview. Love that Margot was able to bring out Cillian’s personality and humor.
#Barbenheimer
Whatever you do...don't sort by new! Nothing is sacred.
Love this conversation!
2 great actors , and really nice people . I would like to see these 2 in a great Romantic - Thriller type movie !
I love cillian asking “is she happy or happier” cause like yeah not having an internal monologue would get rid of so much anxiety
“For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.” - John 3:16 God bless everyone here. Jesus loves you and died for you on the cross. He did this to wash away the burden of sins, and if you open your heart to Him, He can take away the burden of your sins and give you a peace incomparable to anything in this world. ✝✝🙏
THE WAY I GASPED WHEN I REALISES WHY THEY WERE PAIRED UP, BARBENHEIMERRRR!!!
They did such a great job interviewing each other. This was fun to watch.
❤❤❤
"I also love your sleep story on the calm app" LOLLLL margot is such a gem
Leaving a comment for the algorithm
Daddy and mummy in one frame 😍
In order for me to watch this video I NEED TO WATCH a 31 min commercial without being able to skip! really YOUTUBE!???
Best duo! They are amazing.
He's an incredibly good listener.
I absolutely love them both. I can tell you, that a Margot Robbie and Cillian Murphy movie would put my butt in a seat.
Margot asked great questions. Cillian couldnt give a fuck about Barbie
Omg I’m obsessed with both😍
I need to see them in the same movie😍
Cillian Murphy's so hot wtf
I'm so glad I did the barbeinheimer on its first day of release, and it is the first time I was doing double feature films in my life and it works really great.
Anyone else getting an insane amount of jack daniels commercials? Like god damn
More like Margot Hottie
Stop being weird and get a grip people! They are already taken, why are you shipping married persons? smh
Cillian is so humble and asks much deeper questions... pls keep the camera on him.
As a high school English teacher, I used the Barbie movie to teach a mini film studies unit, and my students loved it. They hadn’t formally learned very much about movies in school, but they appreciated the classic film references in Barbie, and we even discussed the evolution of Barbie’s costume as she evolves into her humanity (which Robbie discusses here!). It’s so incredible to listen to the producer and star discuss the behind-the-scenes process — thank you so much for a great movie and enlightening interview!
Aguante argentina pedazo de giles
🔥🔥🔥 ❤💕🤍
Saw Patrol [Saw and Paw Patrol] was memorable.  But Barbenheimer will always go down as one of the greatest moments in the history of cinema.
Call it, liars on liars.  These ppl are puppets who perform as instructed.  Famous for... performing.  Do they ever tell the audience the truth about their industry?  Nope.  So why CELEBRATE these ppl?
Winston Churchill was a war criminal and Its sad that the western media totally ignores this part lol. He was Henry Kissinger before Henry Kissinger.
Barbie just sounds awful.  Have a 25 year old friend tell me it fights the patriarchy.  I must be old.....
Very sexcc video
Wow they have such good chemistry, I want them to date 💖 just watching them makes my heart race
this just feels right
thank you so much for this
I feel like Cillian's accent came out at the end when she asked the off topic question and he said ten years. Like he relaxed a bit and the accent came out
This made me respect the film production behind the scenes so much more, I really love both Margot Robbie and Cillian Murphy and getting to hear their insightful conversations really made my day
We need Margot in next Nolan movie
The hesitation Cilian had when she asked if his parents liked the movie was kind of sad.
It’s like they’re sharing the same brain at this point.
I was so excited when I saw them talk about Tommy Fucking Shelby! Margot Robbie's excitement was so amazing and I too was so happy to hear her say his name like that! So many people are fans of The Peaky Fucking Blinders. I loved this entire interview from beginning to the end! But at the same time I would have loved to hear Cillian Murphy bring up Haley Quinn. This was so fucking awesome either way! Can you imagine both of these two on the set of a Peaky Blinders environment, fucking awesome!!!
I feel like this interview had to be Cillian and Ryan G instead of Margot.
Margot seems to forget quite a lot that she's also interviewing him
the way cillian actually the ken visual
They should run away together and make babies. So gorgeous.
margot having her fangirl moment over peaky blinders is everything to me tbh
omg
Why is Thomas Shelby talking to Barbie
Icons!!!
entertaining talking. they"re like magnets to my attention.
She’s gorgeous but she’s not a oood actress. The one movie worth watching was making fun of a southerner gold digger. Not sure anyone could mess that gig up.
loved when margot brought up peaky blinders at the end
loved this interview! great pairing..
To me...this is cinema
It's only fitting that Cillian Murphy & Margot Robb are in Actors on Actors leading to Oscar night. Thank you Variety....
This was such a good interview! I feel like the Barbenheimer era really spoke to our need for great original stories. Enough with the superheroes and redo’s.  A good story always goes a long way.
- Congratulations on your reasonably successful film! - Congratulations on your reasonably successful film!
❤❤❤
they would make the most beautiful baby🤣
Oh I thought they were gonna be on each other :(
Great video, I love it
this video is so important to me i adore them
my boy cillian was killin' it with his own vibes
People are weird 💘💘
I love their chemistry so much I actually watched the whole interview.. Margot Robbie asking Cillian Murphy about Peaky fukin Blinders was the best part of it
how old are these detached farts that they dont know what memes are?
I tried falling asleep to his Calm app story but it was too interesting!
I love margot so much she is so warm and likeable. what a great conversation
So cool seeing them talk to each other and not just interviewers.
Me I have crush on them both!
So Ryan and Emily next? Can't wait.
What is not to love about these two perfect actors? Beautiful and smart, kind and sweet. These guys are successful and nothing like typical Hollywood stars. Margo Robbie: fabulous actress.  Cillian Murphy: fabulous, humble and great actor!
It’s so funny how Margot keeps interrupting Cillian 😂 you can tell the difference between the two personalities, love them both! Super talented and charming
Apparently, it was Cillian's team that reached out to Variety asking for the pairing, and I find that super wholesome.
She comes off as phony
Margot Robbie came to my rez to film Whiskey Tango Foxtrot, went on a late night show with Tina Fey, and literally said that people from my rez didn't have teeth. Fuck her.  So many people have died of cancer, or have cancer, including family members. I know how Oppenheimer ends; I grew up next to a uranium mine.
ameiii
Can we talk about how Margot fangirled about Peaky Blinders/Thomas Shelby to Cillian?
The next thing we need is a directors on directors conversation with Christopher Nolan and Greta Gerwig.
I TRULY HATE THAT BARBIE WAS A SUCCESS AFTER SEEING THAT IT PROMOTES GENDER RACISM AGAINST MEN
Iconic pairing...need a movie starring them both!
Surprised they didn't try to figure out who has the better cheekbones.
Love him but I got bored after 10. Wll never watch Barbie
Directors on directors with Greta Gerwig and Christopher Nolan is a need
I've discovered Margot Robbie is as obsessed as I am with the Peaky f***ng blinders. Great actors both of them ❤
OMG！！Finally！！BARBENHEIMER
Anyone else get a Jack Daniel’s commercial every single 3 minutes? 😐
What a fabulous pairing. Two pros
They finally did it. Harley Quinn meets Johnathan Crane (Scarecrow)….
i just hope to see these two together in a film someday
two icons of straight up blockbusters!
I hope Nolan puts her in a movie someday.
i'm the happiest. you have no idea
PLEASE BRIN G MADS MIKKELSEN TO THIS, PLEASE PLEASEEEE
Imagine being one of the most attractive men on the planet and not liking to look at yourself 🙃
Give this interview an Oscar
them dressing in their respective colors too omg 🩷
Barbenheimer continues; as it should.
thank you so much for this
Barbenheimer was the best thing to happen this year!
such a good conversation !!
gorgeous gorgeous people
Barbienheimer made history
yeah like ways
Aight somebody’s gotta get these two in a movie together ASAP
this is such an insightful and fun interview but i lost it when she said 'Fast, Fast 10 or whatever' 😆
Interview of the year ❤️
I got so sick of Barbie marketing, haven’t seen it yet. Saw Oppenheimer IMax.
I watched "Barbie" 55 times in  the theaters. I love Barbie The Movie. The Barbenheimer phenomenon is cult.
Scarecrow meets Harley Quinn!
They need to work together asap
BY ORDERS OF THE PEAKY BLINDERS
LETS GO BARBENHEIMER
I can't even see a Cillian interview without picturing Jamie Dornan making him laugh.
I love that this is almost one hour
Great insight on prepping for roles. Thank you both. Go raibh mile maith agat. Patricia Twomey Cork Ireland
Margot is so real for saying Tommy’s fuckin shelbyyy 😂best part hahaha
I love her Australian accent ❤
Omg
damn I was hooked for the entirety of the interview
Not Margot Robbie surprised that there are people that have no inner monologue
Let the man speak please.
43:32 "Tommy fookin Shelby" 😂😂
I honestly forgot about the Barbenheimer connection for a moment and was just like, "Two of my favorite actors! What are the odds I'd get this lucky!?"
it brings back this beautiful summer
HOLY SHIT HOW DID THEY MAKE THIS HAPPEN HOLY WHAT THE FUCK OH MY GOD
BARBENHEIMER!
The experience I had was that Oppenheimer stopped time, and Barbie felt very light in regards to the future
35:00 'just less certainty, really' regarding the COSTUMES, when barbie turns more into human. WOW.
PLEASE DO ONE 'ACTORS ON ACTORS' WITH MICHAEL SHEEN AND DAVID TENNANT
variety giving us what the people wanted
After this conversation, I believe it's pretty obvious we all need these  two in a movie together. And I think Margot is the one signing the petition first 😂
I forgot that they weren’t in a movie together
scarecrow and harley quinn
They both have good energy , the conversation flows nicely it was nice to listen to 😊
Credit where credit due 🙃
Yeah, my two personalities
Damn she’s really really good at interrupting him.
I love finding out Margot Robbie is a Peaky Blinders fan!  Loved this actors on actors, such a good pairing.
meu deeeeeus, amei demais ver esses dois conversando! 😍 a Margot sendo a maior fã do Cillian e da Emily me representou muito!! 🥰 vídeo favorito da vida
Scarecrow and Harley Quinn
Os amo
First time I've ever watched a Margot Robbie interview and wow, she's such a lovely person and surprisingly down to earth
Can you imagine if these two made a kid?
THIS IS WHAT DREAMS ARE MADE OF. THEY OWNED 2023 CINEMA
He is so beautiful! Margot is ok too
I gasped
I so glad Cillian is getting his due!! He is such a good actor!!! Oppenheimer my favorite movie of the year. Saw it twice in the movies.
43:32 SHE SAID IT! She said the line!
i have never in my life seen cillian smile for that long
ATEEE
I hated Barbie I think is the wrong message to boys and girls and that the only good thing is the Margot beauty. That’s it.
i love this video
This was such a treat to indulge in!! So glad I got to witness this moment in history. Definitely my favorite aoa interview
Cillian one of the greats ever
I could’ve listened to like 3 more hours. They’re both SO interesting and play off each other very well.
This isn't a genuine conversation. She has absolutely no interest in his answers.
It would've been a lot more enjoyable if that obnoxious Jack Daniel's ad hadn't popped up 4 times.
His irish accent tho ❤
margot exposing herself as liking cillians sleep story IM DEAD
Damn it’s hard to focus. She’s so gorgeous.
Yeahhh the best actors on actors so far.  Amazing. Love this! And Margot Robbie I love you so much! You’re one of my favorite actors. Congratulations on everything!! ❤️
icons
I could watch these two for another hour
There is something oddly satisfying about hearing popular artists/actors discuss and appreciate each others work, especially in such a way that doesn't come of as pretentious or up each others ass.
this year's lineup is amazing!!!
Oppenheimer gave me hope for cinema after a looooong run with superhero movies and the like. First time back to the theatre in about 5 years for that one. Great interview… or discussion.
Barbenheimer in the history books
it was a great balance. Oppenheimer was really intense; Barbie didnt take itself too seriously. I'm glad they came out on the same day: July 21, 2023 🩷💣 a moment in film history
The two most likeable people on the planet in the same room.
#Barbenheimer is 4 Real...  #NakedOppenheimer Not so much...HaHa  Don't forget about #MojoDojoCasaHouse...
my two favorite actors wtf I cannot take it
By order of the PEAKY FOOKIN' BLINDERS
Barbenheimer! 🎉
this is all we need
5:40 girl literally had to explain the concept of comedy to those Mattel execs
Margot liking peaky blinders 😂
2 of my favorites, such nice people.
What a great pairing!! Barbenheimer definitely changed our summer ❤️
This one if for the books
Cillian is a legend indeed.
The fact she’s a fan of his sleep story on calm is REAL
Greatest summer ever. Very fun and exciting. Thank you, Variety, for hosting these two.
Peaky Blinders has really earned it's hype. And It's also one of the few shows that has spoken out against any political party using their clips for personal gains. Im so glad Margot is a fan of the show!
Amazing pairing
I actually listened to the "This American Life" podcast about the woman who can't self introspect that Margot mentioned she used as inspiration for her Barbie performance after this, and it's SO interesting. I highly recommend giving it a listen.
the sun never sets on the british empire
I watched both Movies and it is the best thing that came out from the cinema. Job well done! 👏🏽 👏🏽 👏🏽
Cillian aging like fine wine. What the heck. He looked scary in Red Eye but look at him now.
Both are wonderful, accomplished artists in their own right. However, watching the girl crush nervousness Margot had and Cillian trying to keep his cool with this stunning powerhouse of a woman flattering him was kind of cute. Not taking away from the intelligence of either, just interesting to watch the dynamic between them.
I would have enjoyed hearing Cillian Murphy more … without interruption.
Men’s gaze versus women’s gaze in one video
Funnily, I've just finally watched Barbie for the first time a couple of days ago - and I've also recently seen more new interview videos just come out in the last days with Dua Lipa on her song for the movie, plus the interviews like these with Margot and Cillian Murphy as well. Funny coincidence 😆 but yes really loved the Barbie movie as well as Oppenheimer! Two great films 😄👌
It’s so interesting to have both of these actors talk with each other. I saw both movies, I loved them and saw both of them in the theater. It’s history.
I feel like Cillian hates Margot
I love both of them, they are intelligent and smart and really passionate about their work. Amazing interview!
A bisexuals dream.
Is there actually a real Barbie musical? Like the one everyone thought this would be but wasn’t? With like the Barbie song?
THIS is everything awesome 😎✨🤩✨
Awesome!!
I enjoyed this so much!
I’m sorry but doesn’t the Barbie set seem like the best place to be????
Mattel haven’t made a movie before? Aren’t there like dozens of direct to video Barbie movies? And also, Barbie is a character in the Toy Story franchise.
Margo asks Cillian a question and answers that question for him... Let the man speak 🤦🏻‍♀.. wish she would ask more interesting questions about PB
Margot is a significant figure in Hollywood and big story among actors, movie directors, and, of course, the audience. However, I only realized, finally, two weeks ago, after watching the Babylon movie, how beautiful she is—beautiful in every possible way. It took some time, but I came to it. By the way, greetings to Cillian.
If they were single, they'd be bangin'.
OMG my favorite actor Cillian Murphy ❤
wow
2 Amazing people. Cilian Murphy and Margot Robbie are just so wonderful.
The interview everyone had been waiting for!! 🎉🤩
Now Greta and Chris need to have the Directors on Directors interview :)
i have not watched barbienheimer but this was so enjoyable to watch
they make a cute couple aww
She is a real one for asking Cillian murphy about PEAKY BLINDERS.
We need them in the same film.
Barbenheimer in real life
the fact that they wore barbie and oppenheimer colours without being asked to ?!?!??
Me finding out there’s a CM sleep story on Calm app 👀👀👀
Cillian Murphy what a wonder you are
Margot seems like such a student of the game. Will be very interesting to see the work she produces over the next 10-20 years
Just Scarecrow and Harley chillin' together
As im watching this...700k views, released 7 hours ago, #7 on trending 🎰
ARE YOU KIDDING?!!! TWO OF MY FAVES IN THE SAME VIDEO!!! LOVE IT!!!   okay I'm gonna go watch it now 😂😂😂😂
Omg thank u Margo for bringing up Thomas fucking Shelby 🎉
I’m watching this thinking Cillian Murphy wants to work with Greta now. He’s hanging onto every word that Margot says about Greta/working on that set.
Cant believe cillian looks younger than her
Margot Robbie's beauty is intimidating
I absolutely adore Margot’s enthusiasm for Peaky Blinders bc it’s truly one of my favorite shows
I think Margot Robbie is going to be the first female lead of a Christopher Nolan movie.
Brilliant. ❤
This was such a great conversation between two actors.
Honestly, the Barbie movie should have been a series and been per decade. The first one should have focused on the 1950s only and so on
Two of my fav actors united
Why does he look so much like a woman? How on earth could anyone take him seriously as Robert Oppenheimer?
live laugh love being bisexual
That dude aged fast and horribly.
what a great interview!
Haven’t seen any of these movies
As usual, I'm not part of the two groups that people assume must be the only groups that exist in a scenario. I've seen peaky blinders, couldn't keep watching it cuz it was just doll
sorry to be depraved but i need them in a movie together and i need a sex scene
I meaaan, wouldn’t we all ask Cillian about peaky blinders if we were Margot? thank youuu from all of us mortals for this question 🙌🏼 the true fan vibes are killing me tbh 🥰
they got all the right DNA.
The fact that there's not an actual theme park called Barbie land that wasn't created decades and decades ago by Mattel is just poor marketing
Barbenheimer 🩷🖤 congratulations you both, you’re so talented!!
literally the best actor on actor video
Can i just say this was long overdueee
Two complete opposites.
That was soo epic interview, I just wanna say something:  BY ORDER OF THE PEAKY FUUUCKINNG BLINDERS 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
How did you convince Cillian to do this? He hates interviews!
Barbenheimer: Epilogue
Oppenheimer did not invent Atomic Bomb, research it.
Barbenheimer was a cultural reset
7 hours with 700K views holy shit this is peak. Also remeber on twitter like a minth ot two ago people literaly were fighting if Margot was attractive or not lol
These two Batman villains just chilling together
I love them both so much, they’re both so talented and beautiful and yet, so humble
Excellent interview I truly believe Cillian Murphy is one of the best actors there is today and Margot is great as well
Whoever paired them here deserves a raise but whoever decided to dress them in black and pink deserves a promotion.
why are they both so beautiful
Brilliant conversation 😍😍😍
Margot is talking about Greta's work with such passion and seems so inspired. I would love to see her direct her own movie one day.
they are bi panic embodied
Are we realy talking about barbie movie !?!?
My loves
Barbie 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Cool conversation. Two of my favorite currently working actors. Barbenheimer was a neat phenomenon. I loved Oppenheimer, my favorite of the year, didn't quite connect with Barbie but appreciated a lot of things about it and Ryan Gosling was funny. Big fan of Gerwig's last two movies and Chris Nolan is my favorite director.
Loved Oppenheimer. Watched it in theaters. Didn't watch Barbie in theaters . Happy for Margot but the movie is Meh.
I love Margots Peaky Blinders geek out at the end.
We all miss the cinema. It was nice to have it come back with these two movies.  I mean who doesn't love a good movie?
What in the world is a boiler suit??
I really like both of them. Excellent actors. I loved her in "Babylon" and "I Tonya".
For the love of all that is good, put them in a fucking movie together! They have great chemistry.
Barbenheimer IRL
Is Cillian Murphy… enjoying himself???
So off topic, but I can't believe there are people out in the world without an internal monolog. 😂
Poor cillian has to pretend he likes Barbie
Forewarning the first 5 minutes of this is Margot Robbie talking non stop full motor mouth
Thoroughly enjoyable interview. And uh Margot is just so charming and vibrant and it’s lovely to see Cillian so engaged in this interview.
Margot Robbie is gorgeous. No question. But she is even MORE beautiful because she's such an intelligent and great actress on top of it.
Timestamps 0:15 intro
I WAS HERE 6 HOURS AFTER UPLOAD. 500K VIEWS. THIS IS LEGENDARY 👏
"tommy fookin shelby" - margot
The memes were hilarious, but the fact that both films truly managed to live up to the whole Barbenheimer hype is the most incredible part
Naurrrr
I love them both. Ms. Harley Quinn She is such a real nerd which makes me love her even more. lol And of course EVERYTHING Cillian does is incredible Mr. Scarecrow (lol I'm a DC fan girl if that's not obvious).
What a pair, have to see these two in a movie together
It speaks to the homogenization of cinema that two wildly different films can come out at the same time and it makes news. I remember when I grew up, in the 90's, you had an insane slate of different kinds of movies to choose from any given weekend at the box office. Now, it's become a novelty when even two movies aren't alike. That's interesting and sad at the same time.
I've never seen someone's face, especially a male, where their natural given face looks like they have had an abundance of really bad plastic surgery
LOLing at the Barbenheimer team-up. And the fact that Margot is wearing pink and Cillian wearing black. They are definitely respecting the meme, and how it helped their movies.
margot clutching us a spinnup peaky blinders movie for us 👏
She did mention Thomas Shelby, i love this women.
ahhh loved this 🫶
god i love Cillian! he is so amazing in real life as I can see in this interview
43:30 nah this moment was way too cute, i simply LOVED this video, never knew i needed
You can tell that Cillian dont give a fuck about Barbie shit movie. It makes him sick
Thank you Margot for asking the hard hitting questions we’ve all been wondering, like does Cillian Murphy finally know what memes are?
This is awesome.
yesssss
This is the Barbieheimer interview we needed!
this changed my life
This is wholesome!!!
Loved thissss
MORE
In the film they look glamorous, but in ordinary days they are like workers at the factory.
Oppenheimer was a whiskey film, Barbie was a fuck ton of edibles and both were very enjoyable😂
They both carried cinema on their shoulders this year
Margots accent is so cute
Hm. I felt like I could cut their tension with a knife. First Cillian was speaking about Nolan always releasing his movies close to that date (somehow trying to imply that Margot/Mattel deliberately chose the clash), and Margot gently shut him down.   He also spoke about how he thinks Australians can often easily do American accents well (Margot gets a lot of praise about her impeccable American accent in English).  I just feel Cillian feels a little bit some type of graceful Englishman way about Barbie overshadowing Oppenheimer (though both movies were ultimately huge successes).   I think Margot was taking ownership of her win but was also careful (and maybe a bit deliberately humble?).   Just want to watch Greta in the roundtables this year with Nolan . It’s gonna be fun to analyze.
This could have been much longer!  Margot is so Charismatic and Cillian is so Cool!
It is pretty insane that the Barbie brand has existed this long and they didn't ever think to do their own movie franchise which would have been effortless
been waiting for this shit
Can you believe there are real people in this world that unironically say Margot Robbie is mid?
If they ever make a Nolan biopic, they should have Cillian play him. He already has the voice down 16:53
You love to see it
I ship
Margot: I was sweating.. Cillian: excelent
Terrific pairing and a lovely nod to the Barbenheimer experience - people went back to the theaters in droves because both made terrific films. I'm  guessing, but it seems likely they'll be co-presenting at the Oscars this year. '23 was the year of Barbenheimer.
margot robbie is just a fan just like us aha
Ughh loved this, thank you Variety!
I don’t blame Margot Robbie, how can you not ask Cillian about Tommy fooking Shelby!!!
Two lovely ppl. “No, F*#king, Fighting”!😂
This guy scared me as a kid still does 🤣
♥️♥️♥️
Just like hollywood to meat ride on trends for more publicity. Hollywood puppets in hollywoods fake ahh game.
I just can't look at him. He's absolutely bizarre looking! He looks like he's wearing a wax face of someone else. It is so disturbing
Gotta love how Margot is wearing pink while Cillian is wearing black. They really are embracing Barbenheimer and its impact. I couldn’t be more happy. Love these two.
I love that Margot is wearing a 1986 Barbie and the Rockers jacket and top.
Batman has punched both these faces.
They would make an excellent spy thriller together! I loved this conversation.
it's always so inspiring to hear actors exchange opinions and techniques on their job. cillian and margot are two of my favourite actors like EVER and i'm beyond happy that they got this possibility to have such an enriching confrontation. i loved this
This is a fever dream
this type of content is way more entertaining than most promos they force actors to do for movies
barbenheimer was such an amazing period of time omg
Cillian Murphy for Dr.Doom and Margot Robbie for Invisible Woman!
This video has cured all my mental health issues.. 😅
Is Ryan Gosling in one of this episodes?
90% of the conversation was Margot and … I‘m here for it
Margot asking about the Peaky Blinder movie was so real
Two of my faves! Yesss! 💜
ok what do we do were normal
The Barbenheimmer
So much craft from two phenomenal actors.  This was an absolute  delight to watch.
Wait forget Barbie and Oppenheimer, this is Scare crow and Harley Quinn interviewing each other
If I look like that at 47!
38:27 when Cillian says "every wednesday" with an irish accent that didn't come up before, so good to hear it
The two MVPs of 2023
What a collaboration ❤
MY WIFE
Margot won me at the pesky blinder part girl really wanted a  spin off like all of Tommy Shelby fan 😭😭💕
Barbenheimer..
I loved both movies, and was one of the people who watched them back-to-back. I saw Oppenheimer several times because I'm a huge fan of Christopher Nolan lol. I love film-makers who step out of the box.
I NEED AN IRISH MAN TO SAVE ME NOW
Wow, an interview I thoroughly enjoyed!
I've been a fan of Cillian since 28 days later came out. I love his characters.
5 whiskey ads
now we need a film with cillian murphy and margot robbie both starring
Cillian Murphy is just brilliant and beautiful!
AHH YESSS SO EXCITED FOR THIS
Originals❤
12:01 Who's the girl on the left?
The prince of Ireland with a basic brat…
Two people at the very top of their game
we need Cillian Murphy & Ryan Gosling
Do you think Cillian actually believes Barbi to be a "good movie"?
I love the two of them, we know Cillian and Nolan are phenomonal but I really have such immense appreciation for Greta and Margot's work ethic, professionalism, artistry and creativity. The more I think about  and watch Barbie, the more I adore it's entertainment but also humanity, fun and emotion. Gosling is hilarious but Margot made me cry and fall in love with Barbie's optimism, vulnerability and strength.
Hilariously, Murphy has obviously yet to see Barbie.
The worst thing about this video is that it ends 😭 could easily have watched these two chat for hours
She talks too much...
They have fantastic chemistry and compliment each other so well. You can really tell how much they respect each other. It's so fascinating to hear how different even the making of these movies were. Now we need to see them in a project together!
I can barely make out their accents.  They are so talented.
Somebody get those two in a movie together, pronto!
This people. This
It blows my mind now women can be so beautiful and wise and emotional and practical and fun and serious at the same time. I love when women
Man what a great sit down with these two. Margot geeking over Tommy Fn Shelby, Gold!
Introvert Vs Extrovert, Physician vs Doll, Serious vs Happy, Oppenheimer vs Barbie, Cillian Murphy vs MArgot Robby
Is this greta director as great as Margot is trying to make her be or is she genuinely good? Not talking about just this one movie. Cos I genuinely have never heard of her ever until this movie.
Bro its barbie talking to oppenheimer
Hello Mr. shelby
The fact that two of the biggest stars of 2023 and in film history can sit in a room together and celebrate the historical significance of Barbenheimer, just shows you how great of people they both are. ❤
It was such an obvious yet such a surprising pairing that actually worked insanely well. I've never seen Cillian as interested in an interview as in this one and we have to give it to Margot and her enthusiasm and obviously her being a fan of Cillian helped the conversation go as naturally as it did. And I love how she got so excited when Emily's name was mentioned and she just didn't skip a bit and started complementing her and her acting. I love seeing great actors have such respect for each other.
An Irish and an Australian walked over to America and played two of the most iconic American personalities.
🔵👄🔵          🔵👄🔵
Great interview
Bro , just imagine Margort in peaky blinders film with Cilian
The inception joke was so Barbie of her 😭🩷😍
got 26 minutes into this before realizing she's Australian
i'm literally hanging out with margot robbie and cillian murphy
I never noticed Cillian had freckles before now... wow!
And no one make a comment about each of  them dressing with the pink and the black reflects their rules in their movies .
Barbenheimer was so big that it bombed the new Mission Impossible movie. Insane.
Cillian does not speak too much 😢
Barbenheimer was an all-time cinematic moment imo
That was just so pure, so rare in Hollywood… ❤️
No introspection??? Type of autism???😯😯
Nobody can resist Margot Robbie, not even Cilian 😆
Hmmm...weird seeing Murphy doing this type of shitty interviews in a shitty platform....oh well
Thank you for this! So glad to see two amazing people coming together to talk about their great work.
Funny how there's so many women who DO look like Barbie on purpose with plastic surgery and clothes!!😄😆😅😂😄😆😅😂😄😆😅😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
cillian is just taemin in another universe
This was so fun? I didnt expect them to get along. But they managed to have engaging conversations about acting itself.
Margot is all of us Peaky fans and I couldn’t be more happy she got him to talk about the show with a new angle we hadn’t heard before. Great duel interview!
These jack Daniel’s ads are getting out of hand ! lol
This was brilliant.
Awww that was great I really enjoyed watching this
I think after this interview, Cillian is dying to work with Greta 👑
they’re both so hot
Cillian’s fingers are so tiny
Next we need Greta Gerwig and Christopher Nolan having a conversation. It's a must at this point!
Who did this, GIVE THEM MORE MONEY
what struck me abt these two movies is that they are very much about the enormity of life and death ("do you guys ever think about dying" vs "I am become death") and it's neat how those ideas are communicated in such complementary ways
I'm probably the only person watching this video who still hasn't seen Barbie
THIS IS WHAT I NEED🤩🤩🤩 These two really need an Oscar tho
This was so entertaining to watch! Now go make a movie together! 😄
They look like siblings
This will probably be Variety’s most viewed video.
i keep seeing the jack daniels ad
Yes JULY 21ST WAS MY DAY MY BIRTHDAY
Its awesome how much this man and woman, who have never met before, can be completely engrossed in their craft and honest with each other, even in a fangirl moment with Margot. I was grinning the whole time I watched this. Much like Barbenheimer, its nice to see completely different people coming together in respect.
Thank you, this was fascinating.
There's footage of Oppenheimer in news, interviews, etc.
Why did I get the same Jack Daniel’s ad 10 times for this video
The Peaky Blinders fangirl at the end LOL
CILLIAN IS SO HANDSOME ASF-
she’s so real for bringing up his sleep story on the calm app
43:19 I smiled so much when she said this hoping he would tell us if the movie is being made soon 😂. Edit: Margot Robbie is so right about that Peaky Blinders ending song, it fits it so well and is one of the best tv show endings ever in my opinion
They are both so cool and so attractive. They both have a very calming presence. They should play siblings in a movie.
Screaming!!!
The best episode!!!!
I love that what they're wearing is basically what people are wearing when watching Barbie and Oppenheimer
OPPENHEIMER WAS A TROUBLED MAN, SADLY😪
This is the first time I'm meeting you  Likewise
Now get Emily Blunt and Ryan Gosling!!!
Margott deserves an Oscar though not for Barbie but she sure does.
Murphy was so scary good in "DEAD EYE"
the fact that this was sponsored by American Fiction
I freaking love this actors on actors section!!!!!!
Literalmente soy Margot preguntándole a Cillian sobre Peaky Blinders.
35:19 that is EXACTLY what I was thinking near the end of the movie!! Cool to hear that was actually intended!
I have gotten 5 Jack Daniel's ads while watching this. It's a sign from god to become an alcoholic.
interview of the year.
When Margot brought up peaky blinders! Yes!
the way the “inception of a meme” quote has multiple meanings bc cillian was in both inception and the meme…
👍👍👍
This is Cillian Murphy at his most engaged. Brilliant to see if you ask me. He and Robbie should be in a movie together 🤣 😭
WE NEED THEM IN A MOVIE TOGETHER 😭😭😭
So here for her pressuring him to do the spin off peaky blinder movie 😂 ♥️
this is everything i need and more
Barbie was trash in my opinion. Predictable.
If there's a Barbie sequel, I think Cillian making a cameo or even having a supporting role would be both outstanding and a fantastic recognition of such a massive cultural phenomenon.
Truly just in love with this.
2023 was a great year thanks to Barbenheimer 🫶🏻
Margot Robbie begging Cillian for a Peaky Plinder spinoff movie is hilarious😂. She´s one of us!
mother and father
Yo Margot let him talk
Imagine a Cillian podcast
This type of content must be so good for young actors on the come up, such good advice from the best in the business on their profession down to the specifics of how they prepare
I love them so much
They need to work together.
honestly this is exactly what the earth needed after this year
margot robbie must be the most charming woman on earth
A-listers
I am still shocked Variety managed to get Cillian out of the house for an interview
Variety about to break the internet.
40:29 Margot said it perfectly! Take notes MCU!!!
What an amazing interview
MARGOT ROBBIE SHOULD PRODUCE AND STAR IN 1970'S DUTCH FILM "A QUESTION OF SILENCE" REMAKE. THERE'S 6 GREAT FEMALE ROLES!!!👍❤
Barbenheimer taking over the summer was something the world needed, two completely different movies bringing people together.
This video is more about Barbie than Oppenheimer which I love
Does anyone know the name of the This American Life episode Margo mentioned?
What? This is real and not an edit?
margot’s so real for asking abt peaky blinders
Civilian great I. "PEAKY BLINDERS" along with Tom Hardy, Adrienne Brody...very good👍👍👍👍👍👍
Fast 10 or whatever 😂😂😂😂😂. The shade!
I'm always shocked when Cillian starts talking even though I'm quite aware he has an accent. He's so good at dialects!
Margot would make a fantastic interviewer, she is so smart and versatile.   Her answers were also super interesting.👏👏
Murobbie!!!! That could have went on for a week and I would have thought not long enough.  Now all I need is a Thomas Shelby and Harley Quinn buddy movie and I will be complete!
Film history.
Bro interview was good, sure, but goddam Margot couldn’t let Cillian complete his thought at all…. Jesus! Let the man speak.  Love them both but damn!
i've never clicked so fast on a video! This made my heart whole :)
I got to watch 'Oppenheimer' in July with my brother I enjoyed the second Christopher Nolan movie I've watched in theaters. I first 'The Dark Knight Rises' I really enjoyed the bomb scene in the movie. I haven't watched 'Barbie' yet. The Barbenheimer memes, I'll never forget it. Pure awesomeness, I'm glad to witness a global movie meme month of July!
A real-life Barbenheiner meeting
I read “Cillian Murphy”, I click, simple as that.
رامین ستوده جان دمت خیلی گرمه مشتی هستی. مرسی بابت این مصاحبه خفن که پرودوس کردی. مرسی از تیم خفن ترت.
Guys, you are great actors with an “it” factor, so rare, that very few, even very good, actors who can possess such a screen presence, which compels us to watch your movies.  Too bad, this particular movie, even though, I can clearly see it, such a subject of pride to Margot, cannot possibly connect to a wide audience, in my humble opinion.  It is sad that the box office of this size had such an acutely skewed demographics of predominantly young audiences.  I’m 66, and to me, the movie is too verbose, cerebral, to a point of being, all out, preachy, with very unnatural depictions of relations between sexes.  It is almost, as if the movie was making fun of its own protagonists. I just hope that was not the movie’s main objective.  Was it, or I completely misread the idea?  Even though, I watched all the way to the end, i did not find a happy ending, which main characters are supposed to have, being Ken and Barbie.  I don’t know how it feels to you guys, but where is the happiness in all of this?  Movies are not real life, especially, movies about two most famous sex symbols.  I suppose there is a hunger about real life movies in the society, at the moment.  Mostly among the young, who believe they will live for ever, and seriously believe, there is something beautiful and magical awaits them, just around the corner.  In the meantime they are willing to watch someone else’s suffering, on the screen, since it’s just a make-believe, anyway, created for their emotional enjoinment, in reverse, a titillatingly depressing adventure, which is only ok for the duration of the movie.
Now we have to have Greta Gerwig and Christopher Nolan interviewing each other.
People with unusual jaws on poeple with unusual jaws :D
Whoever picked this pairing should receive a pay cut because it’s the most obvious pairing in the world.
Loved this episode!❤
She talks too much, I would like to hear more on Cillian
This not even having a million views is a crime.
SPAM BARBEHEIMER IN THE COMMENTS!!!
who paired them take my respect..🙌🏽
Margot being a Peaky Blinders fan and asking Cillian about Tommy Shelby is so wholesome and relatable.
Margot looks so much like Lauren German in the thumbnail for the vid...
Margot being a fan of Peaky Blinders represented me so much
One of the best actors on actors episodes in the universe 😊 thank you for making it happen.
Although I haven’t seen Barbie yet, I’m greatly appreciative of what both these movies have done for cinema and what it means to go to the movies for people
Margot is very articulate, professional and intelligent. This was such a great interview, and you can tell Cillian was actually invested in the questions and enjoyed being there unlike many other interviews he’s been in
should we do a meme about Cillian Murphy knowing there's a meme about Cillian Murphy not knowing what a meme is? hahahaha
tldw
Man I miss Tommy
This interview was fantastic but how many times do I have to watch that fucking Jack Daniel's ad Jesus Christ
OMGgggggg
Side Note Damn... Cillian Really Dose Have The Most Bluest Ocean Eyes I Ever Saw....Also Amazing Actor 🇮🇪
There they are, the best actor duo of 2023
Barbenheimer is literally one of the best events that could ever happen. This interview was so pleasant and refreshing to watch. Lots of class, calmness and intelligent conversation. Cillian and Margot are one of the most talented and wholesome actors to exist and seeing them in the same room made me so happy
the world needed a Barbinhiemer interview
MINE!! MINEEE!!!
i love that they are also kind of dressed like barbenheimer, cillian in black and margot in pink🖤💖
Barbenheimer is reall
Seeing the thumbnail, I was like "wasn't that a good movie??" while realising seconds later they were two seperate movies. I can't seperate them from each other. God I miss summer.
Great discussion! And also best lit talk I've seen. Gorgeous.
Why Cilian does not talk more? I mean I don't mind looking at Margot for 30 mins in high definition but wanted to hear more of Cilian
These are great.
do you have that feeling that you feel love growing inside you?
Shoutout to Margot for bringing up Peaky Blinders 🙌🙌
Barbenheimer felt like the first time people were excited to go to the theaters again post covid. Truly an iconic moment
I love this interview! Such a great pair to conversate
Margot in a Nolan film soon ⏳
Is this real life 😍🖤🩷
loved these questions and answers:))))
The attractiveness in this room is off the charts
We need these two in a movie together
Edging to this rn
This was just the best pairing ever!
You are a star or you ain't! :) A few weeks ago on a movie-marathon I watched Maverick-Barbie-Babylon :) :) the 4th would have been Dead reckoning, but that one I watched a week later on another marathon. :)
The only bad thing about this is that it ended. I can hear these two talk for hours!!
I dont want to pit anyone against anyone but I'm still going to go ahead and say that Margot Robbie is more knowledgeable and wise than Cillian Murphy. The way she is passionate and knowledgeable about her work and how she compliments everyone like Greta and Emily Blunt with such excitement. Man I was missing out on this side of Margot Robbie.
It is amazing to see both of them together
Thats not an interview episode. That is two brilliant actors talking intellectually about their profession and im all here for it
Im also part of the first category of people in this world
BARBENHEİMER 👏👏👏
I found the Ken character and ‘not right’ Barbie is the most interesting parts of the Barbie movie
THEY NEED TO BE IN A MOVIE TOGETHER PLEASE!!!!!
This was just such a pleasure
Love these two so much need them in a movie side by side leads. They’re just so respectful of each other too even though these movies were technically huge competitors with one another. Just shows the fans are weird. We shouldn’t celebrate all film! From Barbie to Oppenheimer to puss in boots 2!!
This was far too short. I want another few hours of these two discussing anything. Outstanding!
Do people care about Greta and Christopher movie specifically, to just watch there movies ?
THE BARBENHEIMER SAGA CONTINUES (Also, not to be dramatic or anything but this interview changed my life and these two people have such soothing voices to listen to and it’s just so endearing to see them interact. They have that very calm energy/vibe about them that radiates so much comfort to me and I can’t even explain it 😭❤️. This is, by far, and in my very personal opinion, the best Actors on Actors episode!)
The sun speaking to the moon, amazing energy
Can't stop staring at Margot lol
Margot obsessing over Tommy Shelby in the end was so real 🤣🥰
barbie was an incredibly terrible movie ---- just terrible
I loved this experience. Thank you for bringing them together.
I really love how margot also wants a spinoff movie for peaky blinders. I needed that haha
That’s great
Oppenheimer and Barbie, or better yet, Scarecrow and Harley Quinn going toe to toe. I love it!
gosh this man is gorgeous and talented.
Variety, you guys have spoiled us. RDJ and Mark were here just yesterday, and now there are other brilliantly talented people sitting in those chairs.
This is everything I needed today omg
❤
Dont think you can get a better actor on actor.... Thank you!
Cillian Murphy - Real Margot - Hollywood Manufactured
Barbie? Give me a break
What a fun little interview two Masters of their craft chatting about what they love to do.
Thanks for the reminder to rewatch peaky blinders Margot!
i NEEEEEED them in a movie together
She's a tommy Shelby fan 🤩, thats cute
so iconic
this was soo so entertaining, I learned a lot from both of them on this interview! barbenheimer was such an event I had a lot of fun going to the cinema, it had been a while since I last enjoyed going 💌
i believe in cillian murphy supremacy
honestly margot robbie gets iconic everyday
cillian murphy and margot robbie supremacy
wow they really put the two hottest people in the world in one video
The moment we've been waiting for
Awesome pairing! Loved this convo
margot represented all cillian fans and i love her for that
This was so Fetch 🥰
I want to be an actor , gave me a chance please...
they really got the 2 main actors of the most iconic movies of 2023, i dig it
45 minutes of cillian murphy and margot robbie praising their directors haha. this one was really cool!
The world really needed the barbenhiemer moment & I don’t think we’ll see something like that in our lifetime again.
margot is talking way too much...let the man finish
Does anybody know what microphone they’re wearing?
She needs to stop saying “like” so much.
La necesito traducida al español pliis
Cillian the entire vid: Yeah
2023 is Barbenheimer 🤩
Wow, I didn't realize that Margot was the driving force behind the process. Super cool.
Hi, Robbie!
I had a slow moment and was like “why are they interviewing each other” and then I was like OHHH BRILLIANT
"Yeah"~ Cillian Murphy
This is soo good
When I was little, I thought Cillian Murphy played the winter soldier while Margot Robbie played Britta from Community.
best interview ever
the person whose idea was this, you have ALL of my respect
They’re so fine omgg… like I’ve never been more glad to be bi
This is GENIUS pairing ✌️✌️✌️
Margo is so hyped and Cilian is so relaxed.
Cillian needs to do a Greta movie.
Oh my god.
A real Actor & a women.
best duo
This was a great pairing, also yeah we need more Tommy Shelby, i think there's going to be a movie next year or in 2025 with Helen Conroy 😢❤
Batman watching this: 👁️👄👁️
Barbie Quinn and Jonathan Shelby Oppenheimer
Any recommendations for her lipstick?
That transition that Margot spoke on, about Barbie's evolution through the movie, was so incredibly effective that I almost didn't notice that there had been such a dramatic shift from the beginning to the end of the film until I realized that she wasn't standing on her tippy toes anymore and had swapped her trademark heels for some more practical and comfy Birkenstocks.  Barbie's psychological evolution was directed, acted, and edited so organically that it takes a second viewing to fully appreciate or to articulate into words. Tremendous job from everyone involved in the evolution of such a timeless yet otherwise vaguely presented character. ❤
THAT WAS A REALLY REALLY GREAT CONVERSATION
Fascinated to hear how Margot put Barbie together. Having no experience so having nothing to fear was how Barbie became different from human. Love it! As for Oppenheimer, I'd read that the real man had a habit of intellectually humiliating people. Was that considered for part of his movie character?
We needed this guys, they made it, we made it
If Barbie 2 ends up happening, I would love to see Cillian as a Ken 😂
Margot is so funny comparing greta to Nolan. No dissrespect for greta, but…. Nolan is probably the most influential director in the last 15 years
The soundmix on this recording is done pretty bad.
happy barbenheimer day y’all 🥹🫶🏼 love cillian and margot so much 🩷🩷🩷🖤🖤🖤
Cillian rarely does interviews and it's nice to see him comfortable with Margot discussing their films.
Damn this like watching paint dry 😂
BARBENHEIMER IS REAL
Classiiic
Who has that "This American Life" episode name/number or sth?
I’m eating this up
it could be much better if Cillian wore pink for this one
Margot repping the peaky blinders fans!!!
This was so interesting given their movies came out on the same day. Cillian is so amazing I love that Margot is a fan of Thomas Shelby because let’s face it who isnt?! Jeez he’s so beautiful and smart he crushed that role. One of my all time favorite tv shows. They are both so lovely. ❤
That man is so daddy
Legendary
It'd be nice to see Ryan Gosling ('Barbie') and Charlie Day ('The Super Mario Bros. Movie') do an episode of Actors on Actors together.
I loved this video, I definitely need more like these.
I love that Margot was fan girling over Peaky Blinders😂
15:48 - Margot wrote a letter to Quentin Tarantino saying how much she likes True Romance. Then she was cast in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.
this is my multiverse of madness
Greta gerwig and chris nolan next
Margot Robbie as Barbie Cillian Murphy as J Robert Oppenheimer  Barbenheimer.
Never understood the point of Barbie other than that it is an odd doll, and now there is a movie about it. The lady is very charming, no doubt. But Cillian is an incredible actor. There have been very few roles, such as those of Tommy Shelby and Cillian, played with such brilliance.  He became one with the character, living the age, period, curses and the pleasures of family, trauma, and thirst for love and destruction.
margot robbie talks too muchhhhhhhhhhhh
Imagine a peaky movie with a Margot cameo.. or a barbie sequel with a cillian cameo 😂 absolutely wouldn’t be against that whatsoever
Barbie is woke af. Stop it
Cillian & Margot 🤩
Man I swear I need blue contact lenses. Having brown eyes is a death sentence
Harley Quinn x Scarecrow
No matter when you read this, it's the best thing on the internet today
Barbenheimer will forever be iconic. Such a great event this year, the memes, the anticipation, the release day , the weeks after that. It was a really fun thing that brought thousands or even millions of people together on the internet, it was so fun. Love Margot and Cillian, this conversation between them was so enjoyable.
Very interesting, love this and also hate this idk
I will be watching this interview over and over again just for Cillian
Oh wow❤
I love that Margot also mentioned Cillian's story on the Calm app. Glad I'm not the only one. :P
This interview needs to be in museums
THE WAY I GASPED WHEN I SAW THIS ON MY HOME PAGE
I´ve been WAITINGGG for this BARBENHEIMER interview. Finally.
Whoever came up with this idea is like God or something. While I’m not necessarily a huge fan of the Barbie movie, hearing Margot Robbie expound on her preparation for the title role and all the business and artistic decisions and machinations that went behind the production not only gave me greater respect for the movie, but helps me enjoy it more.   The part where Robbie discusses having nothing to grab on to in order to portray Barbie and what alternative avenues she had to use instead was intriguing and fun.   This entire idea is so perfect and the dialogue between the two actors so phenomenal and enjoyable that it took me well over two hours to finish it. Why? I kept on rewinding almost everything because I didn’t want it to end. Thank you so much for this.
Would LOVE to see interviews with the writers of movies and series! And the editors. Idk how these quintessential roles are deemed 'behind the scenes'
No seggs scene??? And for that reason, I’m out 😤
As a fellow Aussie, I’m so proud of Margo. As a fan of Nolan films I’m so glad to see Cillian in the lead. I’m just like Margo, I have eclectic taste, and Barbenheimer was tailor made for me. I hope these two (with their partners of course) walk the Oscar Red Carpet together.
This is a canon event
23:38 Cillian realising all the fun he's missed playing dark roles
This was bound to happen
I saw Oppenheimer the night it came out and Barbie just like a few weeks ago. Two completely different films. Barbie was great in its own way but Oppenheimer is just a complete knockout of a FILM. A total immersion of an experience, long as hell though
Margot ain't the sharpest tool in the drawer...she thinks she can beat the algorithm.
O homem está lindíssimo, misericórdia 😭💖💙
Cillian is an excellent listener and uses great probing questions he would make a great interviewer! Margot is also a great conversationalist i could listen to her talk all day <3
PLEASE do the movie, Cilian! <3 🙂
Scarecrow and Hailey Quinn are working together
I wasn’t religious until I saw Cillian Murphy, oh God is real AMEN
Cillian “this is true 👉” Murphy ✨
This was such an obvious pairing. Barbenheimer meant so much for cinema. I surely hope it wasn’t a lightning in a bottle moment and next summer has another big event.
This was great! So nice to hear two talented actors asking intelligent questions to each other and not the type you would normally hear from an interveiwer. Should go and watch both of those movies now.
😮
😊
Margot is a JOY!!! Absolutely love her. It’s great to see her and Cillian having so much fun in this conversation 💜
Jacob
For a movie the size of Oppenheimer with that much dialogue. Does one (Cillian) memorize lines for each week's shoot? I wonder what the logistical breakdown of making the movie is.
Damn, both are so attractive!
48:27  Cillian : nice to chat with you margot Margot: hopefuly not for the last time
This comment section is just wholesome..😊😊
“lean into it! pleeease?” margot speaking for so many of us 😭  i loved this interview, watching two people who obviously respect each other and are proud of what they’ve done is so nice to see
Props to Margot for mentioning Peaky Blinders!!!!!
This is immaculate as a Cillian stan
Scarecrow and Harley!
I would KILL for a directors on directors with Chris and Greta
very cool! thanks!!!
My brain cannot process this combo 🤯. It's like a seeing a double rainbow. 🌈
this is what the internet is made for
I would like to see him as a James bond 😎 And Margot would be a perfect bond girl🤩
Yes Cillian, people dressed up as Barbie and Oppenheimer is flattering.........it's also just plain weird.
This video will start trending very soon. Mark my words!
what a great interview! I hope we'll see these two work together very soon :)
I loved this but I felt like Margot interrupted Cillian a bit too much. There were instances where I wanted to hear more about what Cillian had to say but Margot interrupted too soon 😅🥲
I enjoy every minute of it
We’ve been waiting for this collab
Margot geeking about peaky blinders with Cillian is my favorite thing ever
43:14 margot talking about peaky blinders is so wholseome❤❤
"it's like an inception of memes. a meme within a meme." margot nailed it
🤩
Such a great interview
Its weird seeing cillian asking question😂
I love how she asks him a question but interrupts as soon as he is answering lol
Now Tomas Shelby knows what a meme is 🥹🥹😭✋🏻
Literal perfect faces.
This real life BarbenHeimer crossover is iconic! Cillian wearing all black & Margot wearing pink makes this so much better too.
BARBENHEIMER! i love both cillian and margot and this was so amazing seeing them talk to each other, great conversation
At 17:20 you can hear the gears turning in Robbie’s mind: “I’m going to produce a script in the first person. That idea is so gnarly.”
My one critique of this video is Cillian rarely gets to finish answering a question! Margot kept cutting him off and it was irking me 😅 otherwise, prob one of the best actors on actors in a while
I wish it didn’t disappoint me Margot wanted Greta. She’s such an annoying feminazi and I don’t want to think of Margot that way.
I just realized this is Barbenheimer hahaha
39:09 that exciteness though😍 Also i noticed margot more speaking about her movie whereas i expected cillian speaking of his charcter more beacsuse i thought there was so much to talk about cillian's charcter anyways this interview like the last one was also a delight to watch ❤
loved this
This is so hot
Could not love Peaky Blinders more.
We need a movie with this two on it RIGHT NOW!
Ryan Gosling was the best character in Barbie, it's a Ken movie to me 😊
Hubert Miłkowski i Kamila Urzędowska
Can someone get cillian a coffee like is he doing okay
this is so iconic
Daaaammnnnn
Two hottest people on earth
They should’ve had Cillian dress in pink and Margot dress in black.
Great discussion. So much better than the bland questions of journalists.
The interview was an absolute delight. Cillian exuded a visible enjoyment throughout the session, and Margot's unabashed admiration for him added an unexpected spark to the conversation. It was a truly engaging and entertaining interaction.
Really don't care for Margots constant interruptions
Great interview but I felt like cillian didn’t say that much about Oppenheimer.
Two beautiful people just talking to each other. Oh my.
Barbenheimer officially went down in history.
How do I have such a crush on both of them!
Barbie has an incredible original script, but Oppenheimer' is a technically incredible film in many ways including Cillian's performance. I DON'T UNDERSTAND why 90% of the time they are talking about Barbie.
Gosh she's just so personable and charming she could make an iceberg melt!
What a wonderful conversation.
Scarecrow and Harley Quinn
Probably my favourite Actors on Actors conversation!!! I’m so glad it was Cillian & Margot together. Two wonderful actors in two of the biggest films of the year. 👏 ❤
They knew what they were doing with this pairing.
I love these two! Thank you for this interview!
Her complimenting his sleep story on the Calm app was so unexpected I'm obsessed
Cillian Murphy said YEAH a total of 192 times in the video. Y'all are welcome.
Scarecrow and Harley  in one room. Batman is very nervous.
We need movie with those two!!
Barbenheimer lives on ❤️‍🔥
Beautiful people. Amazing Actors. Great movies
….dear lord they would make beautiful babies
Cillian Murphy, independiente de si reconozcan tu trabajo dandote un muy merecido premio, ten por seguro que has hecho una de las mejores interpretaciones que haya visto en mucho tiempo. Este año no tienes rival sencillamente.
Pls do the peaky blinders movie..pls i beg you
smiled the whole time
BARBENHEIMER
💖🖤
OH MY GOD
Ela me representando quando o assunto é peaky blinders kkk
26:50 Margot Robbie is actually very correct on this! Its so difficult for me to try an australian accent as an American
fantastic pairing here 💖🖤
Omggg
need a rom com with these two
big slay
now I need to see Cillian in a Greta movie and Margot in a Nolan movie
Cillian´s Opperheimer is a masterpiece. Margot´s Barbie was a perfect fit for the character. Both were the greatest winners of 2023. Both deserve Oscar nominations.  (Congrats to Mattel on applying the same successful formula used by Nintendo on movies)
Why are they not talking about GTA VI?
Michael Scott voice: "Oh my God it's happening. Okay everybody stay calm! Stay F**king calm!"
Cillian Murphy and Mads Mikkelsen could be brothers
Oh how I have missed the Barbenhiemer era 💕⚫
Barbenheimer is real!
They are just trying so hard to not say that each one's movie is just better than the other one's
The only other person you are missing here is Godzilla.
Just realised they were both batman villains
Margot is great with people! And you can tell she’s a real fan of Cillian even dropping the stint he did on the sleep app 😂
😍😍👏👏
cillian's genuinely so cool
Pretentious on pretentious
They got a 50-year old langer from Cork who doesn’t even know what a meme is to sit in a room and talk about Barbie for an hour 😂. Cillian Murphy will go insane having to do all this celebrity stuff with the success of Oppenheimer now lol
Ugh.  I love both of them too much.
🖤💗
best actors on actors season easily
Batman villians gave us ✨ Barbenheimer. ✨ Aside from many other notable roles played by the both talents. It’s great to see them in an interview knowing they played as Scarecrow and Quinn.
He’s so shy it’s cute
Barbie waa sucb a cultural phenomenon. Seeing older women, grandmas with their daughters and granddaughters all dressed in pink.....so empowering and cute!
45:29
Love you Margot Robbie ❤❤❤❤
THIS IS AN ICONIC DUO ARE YOU KIDDING
this is exactly what i needed on my sick day thank you
This was so wholesome to watch. They're so polite and professional and Margot is clearly such a fangirlie. I loved it.  This interview basically explains why they are so good at what they do.
I hope Oppenheimer wins best picture at the Oscars next year. What an incredible ensemble and unique film. Dialogue-heavy yet attention-grabbing and captivating. Cillian definitely deserves Best actor too imo.
Maybe the most requested actors on actors pairing
9:09 so margot also knows that cillian is unawere of memes nice😂
Cillian is such a cool and composed dude, I wonder if even he was nervous during a conversation with Margot Robbie ❤
Is this sexy music always the intro/outro music or is it just the vibe ?
They need to do a movie together omg
I can watch these 2 talking whole day....
What an amazing pair♥️♥️
I still haven't seen either movie, but man, the phenomenon that was Barbenheimer has to have been a one in a million occurance. I don't think anyone will forget that era of their lives. It's super interesting to see this from the perspective of the two leads of Barbenheimer.
These two have great chemistry. Would love to watch them together in a movie
barbenheimer>>>>> the crossover we needed
The chemistry between these two actors was so lovely to watch...movie together please?  I’d watch it! Great interview such a lovely watch
🩷🖤
I love this, they were waiting to pull this pairing out after the strike. I'm sure Oppenheimer is great, I'm waiting for it to come out on HBO.  Greta and Margot are smart and I hope ladies keep taking over the box office.  With Barbie everyone can relate to a story about growing up without the pressures of the world trying to be whoever you want to be and it was just a joyful movie we needed in this time of the world.
Why didn't you make them react to Babenheimer's edits? Surely Cillian hasn't seen them he doesn't know what a meme is
His sleep story is the best on Calm. 😅
Margot asking cillian the questions we want 🥹 ❤
43:31 real
“The One that had  Barbenheimer.”
Oppenheimer taught us about the dangerous consequences of physics. Barbie taught us about the dangerous consequences of gender studies.
Omgggg Barbenheimer
I'm kinda losing it. Two juggernauts of this year ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Where is the minute about Tommy Shelby?
When are they going to pair up. He should be in the Barbie sequel 😅
I wanted Cillian to really answer the question of "did you think so many people were gonna watch a movie about the making of the atomic bomb"
Oppenheimer >>> Barbie no hate ❤
She's one of the greatest modern actresses, he's one of the greatest modern actors. Fate needs to find a way to bring them into a single film together
Humble, but accurate.
Bro I love this I wish they talked more there conversation was so interesting to hear
She's so cute
I think Cillian Murphy is the most calm man in the world.
i’ve been waiting impatiently for this video since it was announced!!
honestly actors on actors lineup combos are better than ufc matchups
Now do director on director and get Nolan and Greta. Pretty please.🤗
im rly sorry i needed margot to stop interrupting
When you’ve just discovered peaky blinders …just started season 5 and hear Margot say, “of course there more story to tell, yiu rode off on a f&$@$@! horse” …I can’t even be mad…at least I know Tommy lives 😂  Great pairing of these two…I love how Margot did her research and kept the convo flowing…Cillian has such a quiet nature in comparison. Adore them both. ✨
These two are perfect for a rom-com movie. I am sure they can pull it off by knowing their diverse talent. A good script, dialogues, cinematography. I mean a rom-com story is already being played in my head with Cillian and Margot in it.
First person script? Wow. I never saw Hunger games but I remember reading books before they released first movie and they were in first person to. Who would thought.
I can’t help but see Scarecrow interviewing Harley Quinn. Two forces is cinema.
I love this!! I'll definitely watch it again some months later❤
they would be a beautiful couple haha
Margot Robbie is so clever and so driven and must have been so underestimated being a young woman in Hollywood, it’s so incredible seeing how much of force she has become in Hollywood championing female stories.
I don’t now if I’m just projecting after wanting them to interact for so long but their chemistry is genuinely incredible, and it’s just their first time meeting… imagine what they could do acting together in a movie.
Barbenhiemer ❤
barbie... a poorly written comedy carried by Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbies faces, Vs an Epic Thriller exploring the life of one of the most important men to ever have walked the earth, written by one of the genius directors of the century, with an unbelievable cast.
NOW SOMEONE NEEDS TO PUT EM IN A MOVIE TOGETHER. I’LL TAKE ANYONE PLEASEEEE.
I saw Barbie recently and don't get the hype. With this promotion and overall craziness I expected new Godfather or Forrest Gump. Unfortunately it's not the case I love this conversation though. Margot fangirling Peaky blinders is something else :)
Don’t get me wrong, I LOVE Margot Robbie, but she interrupts Cillian every other word 😭  Still, super great pairing!
margot fangirling over peaky blinders is so relatable
40:29 "I get detached. Something in me can sense it's not REAL."  [When CGI is relied on too heavily] That, Ms. Robbie, is the Uncanny Valley.
Would love to see these two in a movie together. And Margot fan-girling over Cillian is so wholesome. Loved this. Probably one of my favourites.💙
Ever realize these 2 have both been involved in the BATMAN Franchise
historical.
Like, if u want a peaky Blinders spinoff😁
She's so beautiful and yet very down to earth, and lovely and very talented, I wish her to keep having amazing career in Hollywood
Man thinks he is Tommy Shelby or something.
wow margot fangirling over tommy shelby in the end is sooooo us all, glad she mentioned that up ❤😂
cillian's so prettyyyyyy
If there’s ever a sequel of Barbie, and of Greta Gerwig can bring back Margot Robbie, Ryan Gosling, America Ferreira, Ariana Greenblatt, Issa Rae, Michael Cera, John Cena, Dua Lipa, Simi Liu, Alexandra Shipp, and especially Will Ferrell, I wish & hope she cast Timothée Chalamet and of course Cillian Murphy as new Kens   If there ever was a movie called “Barbenheimer”, imagine if both Universal Pictures & Warner Bros. Pictures work together to distribute the movie. I also wish those logos could work together just like they did with Central Intelligence starring Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart.
this was a very nice conversation, I like how there is no background music, feels like I am also with them
They would have really beautiful children...
barbenheimer couldn't exist without barbie and oppenheimer. both movies are responsible for each other's success,  the actors appreciate that and it shows.
Exactly, exactly !
BEST COLLAB ❤
BEST COLLAB ❤
te amo Margot
we all were waiting for the peaky blinders mension
The dream combo
This is amazing!
cillian deserves the oscar. margot deserves hers also( i know there were a lot of great female performances this year but i think margot deserves it after coming close to it 2 times before) . the real debate to me is whether rdj or ryan gosling should win best supporting actor, they both played their roles to perfection and they both deserve it.
I came here from TikTok thinking it would be a 5 minutes interview but honestly I'm glad it's 40 min
This is exactly what Barbenheimer needed! One last hurrah, and a way to show that there is no beef between the two films cast and crew!  What an experience Barbenheimer was!
Is there anything more ingratiating than actors talking about themselves.
Margot bringing up peaky blinders is EVERYTHING😭
I’m gonna remember Barbenheimer for the rest of my life ❤
Margot robbie is like the best interviewer ever??
the person who gave the idea of cillian and margot together in actors on actors is a fucking legend
The conversation was lit by order of the peaky fooking blinders😂
Guys don't get serious  This is just Oscars setteling meeting   you know 😉
Margot really interrupts a lot!
Itching for a Greta Gerwig film? 😂
this was amazing
things like this don't happen often for us, Cillian fans
Margot lowkey begging Cillian to make a peaky blinders movie is so relatable
Greta and Margot need to do more projects together
omggggg
I created the half pink and half black barbenheimer split shirt and i can rest easy at night knowing margot and cillian probably saw it 😂😂😂
I FINALLY GOT WHAT I PRAYED FOR
Oppenheimer would have probably made half of what it did without the barbenheimer meme's
i know it’s not her fault it’s hard to watch this with ms. robbie talking over mr. murphy so much
I get the feeling that this is the first Actors on Actors where the guests were told to follow a specific dress code 😂
BARBENHEIMER IRL
this is my roman empire
This was a great pairing for the Actors on Actors. I'm sure both films will be awarded multiple Oscars 💛
It's great to see this years greatest american accent fakers finally can talk.
🩷🩷 barbenheimer 🖤🖤
I NEED Mariska Hargitay to be on Actors on Actors!
This pairing is absolutely insane - whoever made this happen should get a raise lol
Shameless plug of my 'Barbenheimer' short film that captures the phenomenon in discussion here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR1u41fcj3I
Barbenheimer for life 🔥
THE LE BOMB, IT KILLS THE LE BARBIES
we as a society nedded this
I have seen many interviews with Cillian Murphy, and none of them disarmed him like Margot. Amazing pairing!
Completely loved it!! ❤❤❤❤
I love that Margot basically begged Cillian to do more with Tommy Shelby
I don't think either of these two films would have been as successful without the other. It brought a large variety of people to the theatres in the summer and It was one of the times in my life that I've witnessed the magic of cinema. It was mesmerizing to watch. And better yet these were two fantastic films who could not be more different from each other
I am so glad they talked about peaky blinders I LOVE MARGOT
This girl is annoying and doesn’t seem to let Cillian just get through a sentence by himself.  I want to see Oppenheimer even more after seeing the film clips.
Cilian Murphy: "me not knowing a meme has become a meme" 😂😂
People who saw "Barbie" first and then "Oppenheimer" are sociopaths.
It was soo short 😪😪😪
YESSSSS
They will write books about cinema - and Barbenheimer will be in there. Students in the future decades would find these videos and write their works about it. It feels so cool to actually live through a historic moment!
they had the chance to do the most iconic thing ever and they did!
When Margot debuted, it was obvious that she was ultra beautiful. After a few films, we quickly understood that she was unreasonably talented. Why does she also have to be wicked intelligent too? How do people like this exist? It's as if Mattel designed a perfect human specimen.
I'd definitely watch something that paired these two on the screen. A heist film or a thriller or jump to mind for some reason.
This is what happens when artists make movies not corporate machines
What an epic reunion. Arguably one of the most iconic moments in cinema. ❤️
Amazing! The most I have heard Cillian chit chat.
I needed this.
BARBIE 🤝 OPPENHEIMER
I love that Margot is still such a fangirl for all of this Hollywood stuff! She really is just like us!
they are so pretty
Cillian murphy saying "hey barbie" is my roman empire 😭❤🖤
she's so real for the part about peaky blinders
Damn...I haven't watched this yet, but should be interesting. Bravo 6, going dark.
Need me a cillian
so cool to see Margot mentioning that Greta sometimes LISTEN to the actors while filming instead of watching them. There's a bts video from Little Women were she does the same. So cool!
We are soo enjoying.
I love how well they listen to each other. Particularly how interested Cillian was when Margot talked about the behind the scenes of filming Barbie and her own process of getting into character.
Barbenheimer was one of the funnest film events this year and I’m just glad that I got to be apart of something positive. We’ll be clamoring for these kind of moments next year when we’re trying to get through the miserableness of Election 2024.
I love👏👏👏
I came here for the Emily Blunt praise. It was a great interview, they are both great and hardworking actors.
they're soooooooooo amaaaazing
An absolute win for the girls
