1,100hp Audi TT RS, 1,200hp Audi R8 or 1,100hp Porsche 911...  If you could only have ONE, which would you choose?
Probably the worst video yall done
I had forgot why I had given it a dislike. After watching again, I remembered everything again lol.
Porsche cheat all the time.
Bro the tt sounded like its About to lift off💀
Porsche cheated whole time
Mat lost the drag race…im satisfied
Porche and Audi are my favorite car brands so I wanted the cheapest to win haha
To long talking low  level
God that Porsche is still pissing me off weeks later when I came back to see that TTRS again😂
Those ttrs models can be so freaking fast. I have a 2012 tts, and i absofuknlutely love these underrated rides all that money for those other rides and the little ttrs held it's own
4:47, 5:57, 7:52, 9:24 just pure chaos😭
🤡 in the Porsche
Damn that Porsche drivers a bot, literally cheated every race
This is proper quality, hats off to you.
I never get why anyone would spend 90k on an car when you could just buy a better faster car for that money
Porsche 😍
driver in the porsche can’t listen at all
2:14 matts face😂😂😂
Should of came to America , we invented something called anti-lag.
Get rid of the porsche driver
I am sorry but the editing and actions scenes are just terrible.
This one sucked pretty bad! The porsche driver was MIA, the communication was awful, the editing was annoying. Not one of your best videos.
I want a rematch!!! I want a rematch!!! > After fucking it up 8 times straight...
Wtf Porsche driver is doing🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮 stupid🤬🤬🤬🤬
Quite funny, he worked on the car till 5am to make sure it was perfect, and the driver screws it all up the whole time.... and carwow says NOTHING!!!? WTF CARWOW
The TTRS owners instagram when shown said 1400BHP TTRS 🤔
I love how when Matt has an issue it’s a redo but if anyone else does it counts as a loss 😂
That Porsche driver is such a wanker
That Audi TT RS was still missing something to be impressive. With the TTRS mk3 they definitely achieved it.
Porsche driver cheating so bad.
The thumbnail says Porsche 991 turbo😅
Why the guy in the Porsche keep stopping like something wrong with his car
Get a job, Ray. LOLZ
Just seen this video, and the driver of the Porsche cheated in both the rolling race and brake test. 😂
audi tt rs ❤❤
911 driver might get fired of that for real, like mait... what was going in your head when you where cheating caught on camera in 4k
Why did they never show who was in the Porsche? Maybe to protect him..... Everybody in the comments wants to punch him including me.
Maybe you guys should come back another day. 😂
to much „drehmoment“ 😉 Its ok vor your englisch People 😉 just an joke
I feel like the TT could’ve done way better with the owner driving it
Old video but my word. CarWOW just can’t do decent races. And yanni is insufferable.   Let’s not even talk about the bell in the Porsche
By far the worst attempts of a roll race I’ve ever seen.
Iookkkkk
Every one complaining about the pirche yet it stil won a drag race fair and square 😂
This video is so messy
I think there is a reason they don’t show the Jays face
Junge junge lasst die besitzer fahren, wenn ihr es nicht könnt !!!
The CarWow newbies always screw up. Matt has to explain the rules and keep an eye on them.
try 1100hp ttrs mk3 and see?😏
whoeve drover that porsche, never ever allow him to drive
Porsche masterrace
That ttrs isnt broken?
Do that R8 vs Asco's BMW M5 Competition
Rs6 kerosene AHAHAHAHAHAH
Idk who decided to put 1100 hp in an audi tt but hes a madman
Miami blue the best color
ESmotor have done a huge disservice to their own name and shop.. not one of the challenges was done.. stock 911 would be better than their work lol.
Ray of Hope died today with the Porsche.
“So are my balls right now” got me rolling🤣
Porsche paid well 😏
Porsche🤡 all races porsche cheated bro
One of the worst drag race that i haven't seen . Not for the cars, obviously
Please stop overturning these DSG's man automatics don't work with these tunes just go for the manual all the way these electronics don't work with tuned cars
can anyone send me the link of the video im looking for at 4:19
For the price of the Porsche it better be performing lol!!!!
Mat come on bruh WIN WINN
❤❤❤
Most funny drag vid of my LIFE😂😂😂😂😂
Yani arrogant
Can we have a race where yani has to use a clutch
4:42 Fake Rolex.
I drove the R8 on the track, and It kinda stank.   I mean, it’s great for going super fast, but it has NO load space at all.  Same for the Porsche.   Give me the TT any day. It’s more than fast enough for fun, and it has a genuinely usable amount of load space.  My daily driver for the past 18 years has been a Mk I TT Quattro 3.2 with DSG.  It’s been the best, lowest cost of ownership car I have ever had.  Not the fastest thing on 4 wheels, but plenty fast enough.
Yani all wet when he won cause the porsche wasnt in the race
Just shows dont buy a shitbox Volkswagen aka audi
Cracks me up yanni always thinks shitbox audis are fast. He didn't see the porsche way ahead of him. That's fast
Porsche Guy is an absolute d head
Guys you don't need to be in line for breaking test!
You let a cheating idiot in a drag race why couldn’t Sam drive it instead
Ttrs sounds Like r8
bro the porsche guy...
Mat, your dad is not named John Watson ???? Greetings from Germany, a f1 supporter from 1977 (Ronnie Peterson) up to now.
And then there is Boba Motoring, with a 16Vampir at 1029hp ripping the 1/4 mile in 8,29sec. xD
Ray should never race on here again…
Most frustrating thing I've seen this year. Literally... What the hell was that didnt prove a n y t h i n g 🫤
Audi TT has VTEC
Get this idiot Ray out of the porsche and back into a bmw my god my dead grandfather could do a better job. At leat granddad is good at listening ffs.
Remac vs full on drag car
Matt, bring your fastest car vs a drag car
The Porsche cheated in brake test
This race need to happen again. R8 is a monster and fastest. I thought porsche would smoke it.
I bet that porche driver also is a sucker puncher 🤣
Man that TT needed driver mod. Should have been starting off at a MUCH higher rpm. Would have been a better result but nice video!
I rarely watch videos of tomb cars because I'm not a fan. There are two problematic i've never watched a video where something didn't go wrong.
And audi tt rs stage 2 runs the same quarter mile time with less than half of the horse power of this one. Either someone is bad at driving or someone is lying about how much horsepower these cars have.
that reys is shit cheater driver ruined the race every time ban him forever
The R8 doesn´t need a built engine or Gearbox with only 1200 HP😂 That´s low numbers on ethanol. A German daily drives his 1000HP R8 for 2 years now and it runs like day 1. The V10 engine is the most over engineered and best engine to tune🤷‍♂
Why can’t the Porsche just follow the basic rules
If "giving no fucks" was a person, that'd be Rey. Lol
7:04 The Porsche got behind..AGAIN!!
In Sa all rs3 run 9 second flat quarter mile
Bro in porsche is a cheater😂
cool video!
Well Performance. All are very good cars.
Single best video.  Fantastic.
4:46 aaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAA
5:57 mat is smoking.
LMAO 😂😂😂😂 you guys are the best.
i really like the porsche and that makes me hate the driver even more for messing up every race
Porsche cheated brake test
لم يصلني  فيa24 في الجزائر لقد وصل تقريبا في كل دول العالم حتى المغرب بجانبنا
Even though the porsche driver was sketchy i do think that the porsche could have won doing fair races.
That Porsche can't get level,   unobjective results
Porsche driver sucks. Fire him
I’ve never heard someone try to say “ that the gearbox is a delay in an Audi its a dct transmission man really couldn’t drive that TT the whole time clearly if you’re not getting boost till higher RPMs start the roll races in higher RPMs it’s not that hard.
where's my bloody walkie talkie the best part
Porsche driver is absolutely rubbish killer 😢
I tuned my AMG c63s nothing happened it just feels faster
That Audi TT rev sound is just best 🔥
Yane is best ⚡
the Porsche cheat on the brake test
I’m two years late, but this was intense.
Porsche cheated
Ttrs ftw 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Don’t ever put that Porsche driver in a video again. What a clown
Sounds like a bunch of whining to me.
Why is the guy driving the Porsche such a prick!
I think we've learnt 2 things here:  Don't fuck around trying to tune cars that were already perfect.  Yanni and Matt are too used to launch control and aren't the best drivers in the world.
no respect for other ppls car in this vid
Isnt that Arthur's TT not his son nicks?
blud doesnt even to be level
You got to get them diesel trucks in there. I’m like talking about the Cummins guys😉 #Firepunk
GOOD MORNING BEAST MAT WATSON CAR WOW CANADA ONTARIO YOUTUBE VIDEO MISSISSAUGA TRANSIT 🇨🇦🇨🇦🍀🍀🍀🌿🌿
Tt😂 Imagine saying in school my father gota a TT😂😂😂😂
Episode should be called....The Powder Blue Porsche, also known as CHEATER!!!!!!!!
The tt is probably my favorite sounding car here it sounds like a full rally car
Love the porsche but the driver is all cap😂😂
Do a toyota supra vs???
ES Motors is asssss
this is the most chaotic carwow drag race video ive seen
at 8:05 Mat  sounded like a 5 yr old getting their lollipop taken away.🤣🤣😂😂
4:15
Do a Lexus lfa
Love Yianni's Rolex❤😭🙏
Porsche guy was sweating it too much. This is just a car comparison, this is not an actual race.
Well done Ray, you messed up the races......ffs.
Fire that porsche guy immediately
Porsche, great car, lousy driver
ES cheating like they do on OG
Porsche just cheated all over 😂😂😂
Porsche is to fast
not level in the breake test
Ray is an absolute asshole he did everything bad with his arrogance, but why in the world would you stop your car in the middle of a drag race if yanni's car didn't work,  you could still finnish the race with matt mate if I was there I would run you over with the car.
Oh everyone is giving ray shit 🤣🤣🤣
VW vs VW vs VW  crazy how they are so dominated the comets against each other
Porche driver not a professional
German Cars are just the best
R8
This is by far the best carwow episode ever 😂😂😂😂🎉
GTR 1902HP
THEY TALK SO MUCH SHIT
Hi, the guy in the blue porsche is cheating. in the rolling race he stays behind and just before the marker he accelerates from that behind position, so at the marker he's already at higher speed/revs and at the marker he's actually overtaking you. In the brake test he brakes too early from a behind posrition also. regards
Ray or what ever his name is... the 911 shud have been disqualified for not sticking to the rules of competition...
Why does Es Motor porsche alway break down?
Bro they ruined a perfect from factory porsche smh
STOP SLEEPING WITH MY FING MUM DUDE ITS SO NOT COOL DAWG
In the rolling race and the brake test:  Q: Ray (guy driving Porsche), how much do you want to cheat? Ray: YES!
Who is the faceless "trying" to drive the porsche ? Pathetic lol
🤠😎😍Porsche 911 Turbo-S🥇🏆
Yianni is so cool. Treats the people with respect when they’re teaching him how to use the car and is just humble. Don’t get me started on the Porsche muppet tho…
the way that that R8 showed yannis animalistic side
That Porsche cheated in everything , don’t know why because he would have won anyway.
I would like to see top of the line Chevy vs. Audi 8, 911 Turbo, Mercedes AMG, BMW again Lambo, whatever you can get your hands on.. however, if we are going to look at "top of the line models" lets see the Corvette ZR1. Its only fair. Apples to apples. Cheers mate.
Have a go at an Cadillac Escalade V.....6.2L taken from the Corvette. Yep. Would like to see that drag against any formidable opponent. Just a note, that if you are going to compare a Maybach to  a Cadillac, then it should also be the top of the line offered....the V. Love your vids man. Huge fan!! Your show is like none other. Yeah, you crush Top Gear brother. Y'all are awesome. Greetings from Texas!!
Mat besides you and yanny all of the drivers need a training session from both of y’all before you guys film the race.
Porsche was cheating in all the races including brakes. Sad display...
These are the types of cars I would like to own :D Some ridiculous power hehe
Porsche for me
Lucky boys
Best video I’ve watched
That TT is Badass, Porsche driver is not worthy of car wow material.
Remove the porsche from the title
The TT Rs sound man is something else 💔💔😍
that porcshe is insane
Audi and r8 all kind problems ,is a big gap between (Porsche )
Dude. Ray's going to need to be placed under probation until he's repeated his training with the program.
10:13 oh my fkn god
Bro just drag race fuck the talk
Insane race🔥
Issue is that all yanni did was press on the ESC button which engaged it into sport mode, for anyone who owns an audi, you need to hold the button which will turn stabilisation control off completely, Audis do not launch when ESC is on, whether it's in sport or not.
Porsche driver bro wtf is wrong with you chill mate there are faster cars than yours no need for dirty moves
Y’all dissing the Porsche saying it’s over tuned but y’all are forgetting one thing… it’s a Porsche🤣🤣🤣
This is BS! How can TTRS lose with 1.32kg per hp vs 1.39 and 1.45? Impossible
People winging about the porsche, one the the first drag race easily
The Porsche driver is idiot
It’s that’s in MILEAGE 😂
Please learn how to pronuonce porschE there is a E at the end 😂
The TT sounds more like a v10 than the r8
The more technology, the worse
Porsche
how is no one talking about how well yan launched the R8, that's 1100 hp and audi's car biggest pros is it's launch cntrl, but he launched it so well like it was on launch control
That moment when he took of, Matt shit himself have to give one a go to this
The PORSCHE guy CHEATED in the rolling test by dropping back and getting a run on the others, CHEATED in the brake test by braking early AND then CHICKENED OUT with long non credible EXCUSES in the Drag race once Yianni had sorted out his starts!  Pathetic!
wonderful
Sill the porche is fast
Can u do a Alfa giulia qv vs Nissan gtr vs bmw m3 ? 😅
The french driver has a lot of experience on track and on open ROAD. But he said that he was almost feared when he accelerate on open ROAD and HIGHWAY in Germany. You get a lot of good tuners in UK . One more time France get the last rank. We are very poor.
Amazing races. The TUNERS have no limits . Last week i have seen a test with a 911 Turbo S improved by the team 9FF, with 1400 hp .
Oh my goodness
Porsche guy ruined the race
whats is wrong whit the porsche driver , never get level
the porsche be like: are you guys done faffing arround with your broken problemtic cars? I have a race to do 😂😂
All that work on the porsche just to add .4 seconds to the quarter mile
Audi TT RS and Porsche
Porsche is the greatest car in the world of this class of car.  Just all around better than everything else.
THE R8 WAS INSANE
That TT is awesome
We're
AYani is susuussuuus
YIANNIS FACE AFTER HEARING THE R8 HAVE STABILITY FAILURE HAD ME DYING😭😭😭😭
Was the Porsche driver too stupid to drive or did he cheat on purpose?
1,000 HP from a 2.5L😃
This is the most chaotic drag race video u guys put yet i love it 😂
4:46 matts reaction to the kick down is priceless 😂
The answer is always Porsche
Ray sucks more than, well, something extremely inapropriate.  Good Christ that dude cheats blatantly, taking a run at every race 3... (here comes Ray)..... 2.......... 1.....(There goes Ray)....... Go!
Did anyone else notice the TTRS 'owner' was LLF Nick? and it was likely his dad Arthur's car.
Pls do an m5 generations drag race
“Hi welcome to Carwow. Igitbobabadubaday.”  Lol
The guy in Porsche is disrespecting people 💀💀💀
Audi TT is same car as Audi R8 and same car as Bugatti Veyron. And they are all ugly and expensive, but ugly in the same way but expensive in very different
That cheater in the Porsche ruined the whole video
Guy does not know how to drive
Matt , I'm an American, and  I don't always understand British humor but man oh man you make me laugh all the time keep up the good work
Ray cheat in rouling race and brake test
When are you going to do Dani on his KTM against something like Red Victor 1 or Sick Seconds?
A whole lot of money spent just to lose to a small Spaniard on a motorcycle.
Yanni with teeth grinding screaming yeah! yeah!    So awesome.   Yanni would race shopping carts thru Walmart if told him - you wanna go?!?    Love it love it
Yiani wasn't messin around in that last round
Yami luck with R8 is horrible
the porsche cheating if you see the break check u see that it was behind the cars
r8 is better
jesus loves you all spread the word
Is there anyone out there that can properly tune a car?
The most chaotic drag race I've ever seen on Carwow. And that Porsche driver was just doing his own thing, not paying attention, not lining up. Such attitude knowing you have the best car on the track. Bizarre.
Man that Porsche driver is cheating..😆
Yanni is the most rude paki I have ever seen!!!!!!!!
Civic with a laptop next to supra with a jet engine looking at them: 👀
5.2 Turbo vs 2.5 Turbo... And the Power is not so far from each other. Thats so mental :D
The porche cheated like hell. He wasn't rolling, he did like a pre start??  Accelerated from way back. Porche disqualified
Damn Ray... get fucking leveled
vw vs vw vs vw
Yanni's face in the last race is priceless
Brake test was rubbish
Here we go again, 2 losing bitches and a winning Porsche. lol
Me searching a Porsche 991
Why not just give the owners to drive their own car
Porche driver haven't skill to drive it
Need
I guess they should not do this car races means cars which are tuned man. Stocks are much better than tuned at least they don't get any of this problem
That R8 is mental 😮
This is why HP is a horrible test on a turbo car. You can get a turbo car in which 1k rpms will make ridiculous boost, or you can get early boost with much less power. It is super hard to get a turbo car to do what you want with spec and need requirements.  This also shows how horrible needing launch control is, just drive the car.  It is why I find high boost cars funny on a drag strip, they NEED a build of boost and will take extremely long on setup, but off strip they can't use the build of boost because of traction. You can see those videos of Supra's dominating highways, but they are already going 60+ where they can be in boost at a high rpm in a low gear.
Holy the Porsche driver is complete incompetent
Ray is something else.
Just record the good times. It goes rubbish every time. Who cares if you are in the wrong gear or missed it... Blah
what is up with that porche driver plz fire him or something
My Audi R8 does the very same thing I have never been able to activate launch control I’ve tried every possible combination. Did I’ve been given a specific instructions. It still does not work It’s simply will not activate.
This Porsche driver is nut
The porche guy is a bigger cheater than me
porsche if you start from reverse you win
The porche  is full of cheating. Cheating in brake test and not getting level in any race
The R8 didn’t sound quite as good as it normally does without twin turbos but those flames and pops and crackles make up for it!
This video was such a mess thanks to the porsche guy💀
3:18 Out of context :)
Please wear gear when running cars 200mph mate!
amazing video
To be honest, Yanni is the worst car enthusiast i've ever seen..!!" Did'nt know how to drive properly, dont know how to drag a race and dont even know acceleration control etc...just saying
That R8 had an ESC fault.
A mid engine v10 Audi tt. What you guys think about it
The owner of the TT has his priorities all wrong, it's much smarter to first upgrade your brakes and THEN tune your car into oblivion. My dad always says that fast cars also need to brake faster. It's the thing that saves your life.
Stop bully the little brother audi...
I’m in the RS TT YAY TUNED YASNESS LOVE THAT CAR HEAVY BUT GOODIE LIL CWAR
I love how mat always been busy while yani is chilling everytime 😂😂
show inside view of porsche also, why partiality bro and looks like porsche beating you
This was soo awesome :D fast paced high energy :D
that porch cheat so much hahaha
Yan I love you but you can’t drag race for shit 😅😅
One of the weirdest race ever!! Amateurs.
The 911 driver cheat every run.. wtf? Is that bad that car?
Tbh, it did look like Ray cheated a lot, but keep in mind, he might've tried to build boost as Yanni did, which includes braking during a rolling race. Braking test though - straight up cheatin
😨 HUH❔
porsche guy is a pussio
Husbands says you should race the R8 against 1000bhp Ferrari 🙌🏻
What a blatant cheat the Porsche driver is.... always came up behind the 2 audi's doing faster speed so that when it was time to go he was already carrying a 10 km/hr speed advantage... Did not do his company any favours by FAILING - and the brake test... seriously.
ray is gay
I'm convinced that there's nothing out there that can beat that particular Porsche...S/O to Esmotors GREAT JOB👍👍👍💯💯💯
Can we have a Audi E+Tron GT vs Tesla Model 3 Performance?
It's a shame that people are cheating here too, the TT RS is switched from 3rd to 5th gear in the middle of the race so that it loses to the R8, it's a shame but the Porsche is the fastest anyway
Absolut Cheating
Bro in the r8 can’t drive for shit🤣
Can get hold of a 3.6 twin turbo m7 or new shape golf 900 bhp beast vs
In a surprise to absolutely no one the tuned cars are a massive headache.
The tt is definetyl not inherently fast off the line and could probably use a smaller turbo or even a compound boost setup to compare to the supercars it just seems built more for speed
HOLY SHIT THAT TT FLIES
Porsche is God 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
πιο κουλος οδηγος του r8 και του ttrs δεν παιζει να εχω δει....
🤣 u guys don't even know how to drag race, dude had it in comfort mode nd was scared of giving the TT gas at first and ray sucks at not cheating like wtf u guys own a drag racing channel mate
these tuned drag races are literally so boring use normal performance
The Porsche is just an absolute beast, it trump's other cars easily. The driver tho..
His reactions were faster than the race itself
Sore loser audi R8 guy... Pui Should let the cibai drove the TT, he always been driving the fastest car and pretend damn good.. Paria.
This whole video was Matt racing himself
Porche guy is lying
Audi R8 be like😎😎
Nobody can drive without electronic nannies doing everything, just football and feather the gas.
PORSCHE 911 TURBO S 💪💪💪
Porsche driver got jump starts since he went from a faster roll to pass so got a chance to rev up from the jump. Way to mess up the drags
People in the comments section can't take a L from the Porsches win
All good but  does baby audi deserves cheers) ?
It says 991 on thumbnail, please fix it ❤👌🏽
Why yall dissing the porsche driver😭 it would have beat thek regardless
Why does yianny always sit up like a little kid when he races it’s disturbing
EsMotor is best Wellcome to Turkiye Asın bayrakları 🏁
That porshe is just oustanding
This race never gets old
Got to turn off stabilization control.  Rookie mistake.
why cant they just use helmet with bluetooth headset so they could communicate rather than holding walkie-talkie...both hand hand should be on the steering wheel....
False.,,,  The Porcher is at a different level....
Audi R8 V10 - aka VENOM https://youtu.be/T4IJY807eko
For F??K sakes every good show is with this idiot
Love the brake test what a good way to warp discs
Great video mate!!!
'my car is too hot',.... after cheating
Everyone dissing him for not wanting to break his car know nothing about building them
Ffs Ray’s gotta go. Cheated at every opportunity
You're on video Ray ffs.....
honestly kind of ruined the video watching the porsche driver be an idiot the whole time. was it his first time driving car or was he trying to be a cheater on purpose? you cant tell me its difficult to follow the rules when you're the first person that i've seen on this channel have such difficulty with it. the porsche may have been the best at everything but with such a cheating ass driver It wasn't a fair comparison so as far as im concerned the porsche may as well have no even been there.
Im from belgium which language is this they talk? What a stupid accent UK has.
4.36 seriously that porsche was just gone love porsche
Porsche really didn't get the memo 🤦‍♂️ cheated
That Porsche driver literally cheated on all the first races
1100hp TT.. £80k... With shite brakes. What a helmet
That TT is stupidly amazing
Porsche = Best
The Porsche kept cheating i hate drivers like him
Model S Plaid sedan set a new 1/4-mile record. According to reports, the electric car covered the distance in just 8.834 seconds, with a top speed of 161.37 mph.
Those cars are just mental🔥🔥
The one effective technique I use is staying in touch with a financial coach for guidance, it might soft basic or generic, but getting in
TT Go✈Whoosh!
🔥🔥🔥🔥
That porche just fucks off
THE TT GETS ON BEAST MODE WHEN IT BUILDS BOOST JESUS I WISH I WAS WIT MATT🤣😂
carwow: "Alright guys, this is what we're gonna do..."  Rey: "Well.......i'm not gonna." {0.o}
Rey's the type of guy to wear his Gramp's hearing aids to his Hearing Test. {0.o}
Porsche nailed it. The rest were "can I change the rules so I win". These aren't drag cars and in the real world it doesn't matter how fast you are, if doesn't launch or it break down its no good if its on the back of a RAC transporter.
We not come here to hear ur shit conversation or ur shit faces SHOW CARS & TRACK
13 min vid 11 minutes bla bla bla fuck off
Yo ... That Porsche was crazy
Боже мой, какой тут злой индеец
the fuck is wrong with that porsche driver. seriously? stop using people who are completely stupid
Well those test are inconclusive with the Porsche just not doing anything right, would like to see them done properly
idc 3 are my favorite cars lol
they dont have lunch control on sheeps in pakistan hahaha
7:25 famous last words 😂 That Porsche is actually nuts. Their stock cars are already insane, and it’s incredible to think what their platform is capable of.
The comparisons these guys do are legit awful. Funny yes, but not good as far as proper comparisons..
Besides my little flaming on Matt sometimes xD you are really enjoyable to watch guys. For me a little replacement for Top Gear :)
Porsche driver cheated every time
I paused the video at now and I paused early how dare you Mat
Porsche wins 100% beat this Audis
Why have you got someone who doesn't know how to drive a car do this?
Lol $80k on a hairdresser's car, why not buy something good instead? Also 1 million horse power, lol
porshe
The way that tt sounds…. Is BEAUTIFUL But that driver of the Porsche has to work on his launching time 💀 That dude was jumping every race even tho rolling races
i still like the 911 Turbo :)
lets f1 vs kawasaki pleaaase
Yo ray is such a cheater
Whys the porsch waiting for the r8 at the drag races, come on race the tt
I've never seen a race between tuned cars where they all launch correctly. lol
This is why super-tuned cars are wank. They never work consistently and end up wrecking a perfectly good car while simultaneously shredding its value.
Lmao that Porsche had more then just 1100hp
Yo (looks around a bit) fuck that dude Ray
Guy is terrible at driving.
Get him janny👍🏽
R8 guy doesnt have a brain Go drive  🛴
Hi
If I had to DD one of these it would hands down be the TT!!! Way more practical in every way imaginable.
Raptor r vs TRX next.
A stock 911 Turbo S can run a 10.1 1/4 mile, yet this claims 1100hp and only runs a 9.7??? These #'s aren't making sense.
launch it yanni if yourve got the minerals
taht tt audi is a honey of an auto,less bother to launch yanni cant get it together
audi r8 sounds best tt next porsche last
When it’s Yiani, the video becomes little chaotic and I am here for it!!!
Porsche driver is suck and can feel having bad attitude just replace him guys
and this is why you dont mod your cars. lol
audi tt  i love this car hope it wins drag & brake tests
Porsche driver was the worst... cheated almost in every race... even jump started in one of the srag races...
Porche= the best
Bra film ni har gjort bilwow
Love the porsche
Just get some 60s muscle cars with 4speeds and have at it.
4:15 LOLLL
7:51 - I can't stop laughing
Porsche Always Porsche
The porsche in another level
Listen those are German F1 cars right there, if they can maintain the tuned
Not the best advert for tuner of the r8 lol
Of all those cars, I’d still take the TT RS. Such a mind-boggling car.
The Porsche cheating on the rolling race and break test...jeez. Kind of takes the fun out of it....
I'm telling you now, the brake tests would be far more exciting if you did them when the track ends. I bet you would double your subscription base.
Visst är Porschen snabb Alica
What happened.......weird drag race??!!!!!!!!!!!
I'm trying to get my head around why these cars are so slow, I remember about   20 years ago watching an old banger of a  late 70's home built Camaro that was driven to the Pod do a 7.69 @ 176 mph or so and simply drive it back home after whooping everything in sight..... So what gives with all these so called highly developed 4 wheel drive super cars ?????
Porsche low profile always
Matt why don't you put your walkie by side then drive
Matt is ready to risk it all
One nil to yanni on rev engine
fuck this german car
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RurHZGQtbmg
That's right quick
that porsche driver cheated everytime. Dont have him drive anything else or come back
Audi TT is my favorite
Before I see this video these cars should be running 9 seconds quarter mile.
Roll race Porsche flybys lol. Then braking test you clearly see him slow down before the beginning. Sorry why do that... You're on YouTube everyone can see the cheating. And... With that car you didn't even need to.  I don't get it. It's a comparison not a competition
I feel like , yanee's gonna kill Watson someday 😂😂😂
Porsche drive is hella cheating
I think Ray should never particapate in any drag race ever!!
Here is a fun fact if you get an Audi R8: It turns you into Bruce Lee .. Find the proof @ 4:40
Yanni is a plonker
As always---WoW, Wow,.....WooooooooWw!!!!!!
who does ray think he is?
is that man like Arthurs TTRS ?
The Porsche would have won even if he hadn’t cheated ,which makes the fact that he cheated even more bad
R8
Ray cheated on the rolling race, slowed down early on the brake test, then dropped out of the drag race. I hope hes out of these videos for good
that Porsche driver is such a cheater its unbelievable
911 is too op in this universe
Love it
Audi tt is my favourite car love them 😍 ❤ 💕
The porsche is trash 🤣
Ray was like 60 feet behind and brakes early lmao dude a clown
Bad driver porsche
mat is 26 years old ..
That dude in the Porsche doesn’t know what he’s doing. Yanni is the BEST!
I think this just goes to show you’re wasting your money tuning your car to this extent. What a load of rubbish 😂. These guys have been prepping their cars for this so they’re probably the best they can be sat on the runway. After sinking all this money they can barely get off the line at the first attempt and one sits the rematch out on the sidelines 🤦🏼‍♂️ well done 👏🏻👏🏻
tldr: do not tune your car ;)
Would have the turbo S but wouldn’t drive it like Rey.
It probably a good idea to not invite es motors back for anymore drag races
Audi R8
The porche doesn't understand the race?
👍👍👍👍👍
“porsche 991” 🙏
I have a 2018 RSQ3 Performance, so logically I would have the R8, but my heart's desire is to have a 911 gts. Cheers
That porcha stole my heart , like it always does
Why is there a bloke with a girls voice over 8:34 lol
These tuned cars are completely bonkers compared to stock 💀 Like stock can be pretty insane but tuned just makes it like a jet 👹
Blue cheated in the drag race he pulled up at 120 mph
ohh that audi throws backfire on it WTF
Ray is not cool.
Who would've thought that the engine of the rs despite being only 2.5 liter can still keep with up with the other two.
can you do a buggati drag race with all the bugattis to see if which one wins
the porsche guy could do nothing right in a straight
I like the TT best because it's the sleeper.  So unexpected by everyone you'd race.
I really love how the Audi TTRS' 5 cylinder sounds like the V10 in the Audi R8 lol because it's half the cylinders but the firing order is very similar (sans 5 cylinders of course)
Rolling races needed to take advantage of rolling anti lag which I’m sure all these cars have.
You rig for 911
tunded cars launch control what a faff bloody lovely sounds though
That Porsche driver was sneaky af! Cheated in every race!  Also, those are all great cars. I’d take any one of them 😍
matt is clueless
That yianna is a duce
7:52 what the hell 😂
The Porsche is cheating.
omg
At least on the drag race the Porsche was in line with the others
Ray has no integrity. 😔
Vaya parece que mat se estaba divirtiendo xd
SLOW 😏😴😴😴   .
The guy in the Porsche is lame!  Can’t drive worth zilch!!  😂
Ray’s a shithouse isn’t he
The Porsche Driver have his own World (By not leveling on Rolling Races, and Brake test)
Porsche needs to learn how to roll race... also jumped the 2nd drag race...  This whole video for me was just an r8 vs ttrs
whats trash? i say to you... this channel
i personally love the audi tts so a three way race audi tt mk 1 vs mk2 vs mk3
That boys and girls, is the reason i only drive 6 speed manual.
The porche is a blatant cheat.
Man you should brake boost before doing some of these races
Idk, I think the Volkswagen won
🤣 😂 🤣 😂 Porsche really let me down, I'm such a fan of the Turbo S but the driver felt the need to cheat every chance he got including the break test
Oh my word, does Yanni not have anything else to do?
Yanni funny, excited and then boom
sorry Porsche driver you are disqualified 😆
I had to dislike this because of the Porsche cheating, what a massive let down, ruined
Moral of the story cars like this aren’t meant to have this much power
This challenge is for noobs... You dont know how to drive this cars
Porsche braked early and the reason he wasn't even during the rolling race was he was hanging back to build up speed turn the count cheating azz
This guy in the Porsche is the worst driver in every Carwow video ever 🙄
I love watching Yianni drag racing Mat its the best thing ever 😂
9.9 sec is the time for 900hp ttrs not 1100hp i think he was low boost on this video at 1100hp  should go 9.4-5
Sound of the TT 🤣🤩😍
vw grandchildren
Yianni crying his eyes out acting all serious...Porsche starts 4 car lengths back and still chews the pair of them😆
That audi r8 is mental
gotta love Yanni
Idk how y’all say the Porsche cheated? He was sitting in the back at a steady pace then when he said go he went
Porsche for the win again
man this so amateur. like ff get to know the car a little before trying to race it, at least for like 10-20 mintues. never align, leaving at different times, not knowing how to use launchcontrol or how to deal with turbo lag! how are you guys professional!?
Porsche launch control and transmission is light years ahead of the Audi garbage.  Have to keep rematching with Audi’s while the Porsche doesn’t care.
porsche to win  all tests
They put so many technology in cars nowadays, you need a manual how to launch them. I miss the old days when we just floored them.
Werid cause a TTRS with less then 1000WHP runs low 9’ sec in 1/4th. Just last week we ran 9.3 1/4th at 850-900whp in a TTRS
R8
911 driver is a big cheater.
That 5 cyl
It's pretty shocking, the lack of knowledge about what gear/rpm to start in, when to shift etc. This really just needed the owners to drive them to show the cars potential.
Ray isn’t good at this.
11:50 , yannys face 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
My mustang is faster than all 3 of those lmao
Why don't you guys actually learn how to drive the cars before you start the video? This was a mess.
R8 driver is not a driver at all. He shifting form 6th to 8th gear wtf
All audi gaybois complaining bout Porsche being quick
Yanni is so competitive! His face, brilliant!
Anybody else notice yannis double shift not 2 seconds before Matt’s double shift? 10:19   Hmm what a coincidence
Devo venire con la mia Bugatti Veyron ss
Ma non la sa guidare 😂😂😂
I just wanted to say... Poor R8 ... with right driver results would be amazing
Nobody: Yianny: COME ONNNN!!
Tuner cars suck
Porsche.....again. Not even a contest, give it up.
Damn that Audi 5 cylinder does sound glorious.......
Wow  !  Who knew the circus was in town .
That Porsche driver was really annoying to watch
These need to be raced by the dude who built em.
Ray is a cheater
Has a Porsche ever lost one of these carwow drags?
wow. shoulda thrown that cheater of a porche driver out
4:45
So an 1100 HP Porsche 911 Turbo was only marginally faster than the stock 650hP?
Audi R8
How did he even get the Porsche so hot?
I thought the ttrs hp was fake wow that’s still fast
PORSCHE IS KING
👏👏👏👏👏
Porsche guy kinda sums on the roll race since you guys said go while he was speeding up to get level. So he was already going faster than y’all
goerge malaka would rock all his master rs3
@ carwow Porsche! Always! You can show me that it's the slowest, the worst acceleration, the worst sound... Porsche forever! 😎 BTW... I don't own a Porsche and not even a simple car and never I will have one as I can't afford any kind of, nor a bicycle, but Porsche is my favorite car.
Porsche, still and always... I don't care whether or not it is the fastest, I love Porsche, period.
8:44 he is an actor right?
Porsche just loves to cheat ehh
Sound check ratings:   1st  3:57 =  Porshe 911  2nd 3:14 = Audi TTRS  3rd 3:29 =  Audi R8
Ray is a horrible driver or is a born cheater.
Loool Ray was cheating hard on this one
My god this Ray Guy is a true cheater
At 10:37 did (Mat Watson) said rimac?
How is no one talking about the TT?.. Out of of all the cars it looked the least trustworthy but in the end was more reliable / had less problems then all the other cars.
Facts are facts the facts the Porsche has it hands down, called it before the stats or race starting!!!
gt3 best car ever
Porsche driver cheated in all the tests and then ducked out of the drag race at the end once he realised he would be beaten!  😂
In excess of 5 mins of waffle
Change the Porsche driver please
Yannis mean mug is funny as hell
Yannis face on that last quarter mile lol….😂
Maybe the Porsche drives cheates everywhere he goes, so he doesn’t do the same at home with his wife 😂😂😂
TT is such a weird name 😄
I like you
That's what happens when you mess up with already "perfect" engines.  Stop spending money on useless tuning. Specially on a 911 Turbo S which already is a perfect well balanced machine.
That Porsche cheated at almost every test.......
The porsche is clearly the fastest here and yet the driver couldnt even manage to NOT cheat in one single run.
COME ON PORSCHEEEE
Porsche owner races like the UGR crew... lol roiling from behind and then goes early.  Ridiculously fast car though. It looked it was consistently faster than both those Audis. He definitely hit the brakes early in the brake test though too.
Yiannis rambling on again! Hilarious absolutely hilarious 😂!! Play it at 2x speed to laugh your head off more than normal!!!
Even though The Audi,Audi r8,Porsche are amazing The Porsche Driver isn't...
Audi r8 is my dream car ilove it
The Porsche would be anyway the fastest car 😂
I own a tuning company in Melbourne. And I honestly don't get Ray's problem. When we compete against another company it is purely for fun and a bit of competition. WHAT is the point of bringing the car and even making the car fast if you are just going to CHEAT in every test. Plus the tests were for THREE TOTALLY different platforms so no one gives a shit which one wins its all about seeing the different platforms performing at THEIR INDIVIDUAL best! Also I have seen the ES Motor Porsche's on other channels like OG and they are fucking MENTALLY fast so I really don't get the point. That blue one looks very similar to one featured on Officially Gassed that can run 1600 WBHP so first he cheats on every test by negating lag and fucking up the distances and then he was probably running more than 1100 (could have been 1200 to 1300). On OG it ran a 9.12 at 1300hp and a 9.6 something at 1600(messed up the launch a bit) Would not surprise me if he was running more than 1100 in the rolling race tests. Even though he cheated the way that thing took off was similar in timing to his 1300hp run at OG.....
Lmao to see the frustration great video guys. Then the face on yanni on last race like he was fighting for it lol. Great video guys lol
Porsche obviously
We have all sinned and fallen short of Gods glory and we are deserve hell but Jesus Christ died so we don’t have to go there just repent and believe.
definately the R8
the Porsche 911 is cheating in the brake test he is 30 meters behind the others and its probably near 2k horse power
The Porsche couldn’t have cheat more😂😂
Can you please make more videos similar to this ( modified cars )
Yanner u are a joke man
That the most messed up Video I’ve ever seen the guy in the r8 can’t drive the guy in the Porsche I think I don’t need to talk about him 🤦🏽‍♂️
Porsche guy should just off himself lmao
The audi tt rs is now for sale for 90k
CITROEN X5
Mat is so bad in changing gears
i would choose the tt rs cause its the cheapest and more affordable than both cars that it is still fast
Guy in the Porsche has some kind of attention disorder
delay on a dual clutch tranny??????? sounds like a sore loser to me ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
Porsche cheats the drag and loses that he even jumped the start 😂 he cheated the rolling race and the brake test sooo badly. Like what a goof. Let someone else drive ffs
Dislike for the Porsche driver...
Porsche driver an Level 🤦‍♂️
Checking comments before watching: why is everyone shitting on Porsche...? While watching: oh ok. Yea F that guy lol
Hey Matt would love love to see you use a nissan infiniti in a drag race
4:35 Yianni got fired in the R8 once he started going
I love the ttrs
I’m sorry but they can’t drive
I love itttttt, the most amazing video! 😍😍😍😍😍
Porshe 💪💪💪💪
I really wanted to get another 370Z but, I am seriously considering getting a TTRS instead. Just take a bit longer to save for. My favourite car is probably the original Audi Quattro of the 80's but in rally form. The S1E2. I love the sound of the old quattro and that TTRS sounds so similar with it's 5 cylinder engine.

wow Porsche whatta cheat bastard😂
0:01 I'm fine
8:54 beria mat 😂😂😂
What the fuck ist wrong with the driver of the porsche
The word "level" doesn't exist in the porsche guys dictionary... Btw he worked on his car from 5am so you know he is willing to do anything to be the quickest... Even if it means not leveling up to the others
Yannie was serious you can tell
There is no need to tune the Porsche
if i had a car like that i would never let anyone of u to drive it ...coz its clear that u have no clue how to perform a drag and most probably u will make a damage to the car.
Wow. That's very awesome races. All you need to get is a tuned GTR. That Audi R8 is nuts.
The blue Porsche was cheating. Seems intentionally staying behind so when he levels he is at a higher speed and boost for the rolling. Cheating master 🤣
Track hawk vs urus....if that's how it's spelt 😏
In the r8 you can’t just launch it any kind of way.
Wow that guy in the Porsche really is a tool isn’t he? Seems like the type of guy to cheat on a practice test.
R8: 9.4 secs Chiron: 9.6 secs! Oh my god!
Dude that r8 could beat a Bugatti Chiron!
Never have Ray on your show again, he's a cheat. Ruins the whole thing.
he just didnt know how to launch,damn!!!!!!! read the manual!!!
Whoever is that 911s driver need some driving lessons they way he drives 💀
I think that audio R8 was not capable of beating the proche....as you can see that proche was not even on the level when the rolling race was done...still able to beat the both audi's...that proche is the most power full one
11:53yanni‘s beast Mode on!!!! 😂 epic
I don't know why the guest driver kept cheating, you're exposed on film mate. Great cars, 9.4sec is a fair bit quicker than the 9.7 and 9.9. Despite the hicups that Audi R8 proved it was the fastest, well done.
With the insane RPMs that R8 was hitting, it was nice to see it finally work well at the end.
lets be honest if that turbo s didnt cheat it wouldve still smashed them
Absolutely insane Do more of these vids
RAY U CHEATER
SO THE R8 DID WIN! WHAT A COMEBACK LOVE THE R8! GOOD VID
The Porsche driver was cheating and still lost 😂 embarrassing!
Sack Ray. Flaky, unreliable character
Looks like Matt got himself a cross-eyed 7yr old pitbull from the animal shelter🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
VW empire.
Mat does do this alone or with other people. The Porsche guy could not drive, and that agressive Janni couldnt drive either.
Ray is a Cheetabix
Porsche behaviour aside, one of the most exciting races on car wow, these machines are insane
Why does the Arab looking guy not know how to launch it
I love Porsche, but this TT is really beast..
So yanni can loose 4/5 with a quicker car. 🤔
aussye accent to the limit
this guy in the Porsche sucked like crazy!!
R8 always has problems with launch control
guy in the Porsche what a joker
Now, this is the best race I've witnessed with you guys! LOL
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Do a collab with officially gassed
When i saw that porche i knew it was es motors
i also thought the TT would be the problem.. lol..
i don't get it, when the team that built the car has to explain on how to drive the car and it doesn't work out, then why don't they just drive the car by  themselves
There is always a problem when theres tuned cars involved😂
I like how yawni took up for the audi though I feel like that car was built for rolling mile times not drag races
We all want this Porsche race against the Nevera don't we?
The dude in the Porsche is TRASH! he can't even follow basic instructions
Get Ray out of here ruined the whole video
Shame Yanny can't drive!
Yani shifting gears like a gangster rapper
Not sure why you guys keep bringing back Yannie. That guy is definitely not a car guy at all. His back isn't fully on the back of the driver's seat.
That tt rs sounded like an r8
Every family has a person who breaks the chain of poverty. I hope you will be that person!
1:51 Imo ttrs win. Let's see
That was the most aggressive click shift ever
that porsche driver should never be in a car wow video again lol
£25k extra for the R8 and just 0.4secs quicker with drag race fuel. As for the 911... Prefer to spend the extra 25 on the TT for better brakes and a top variable turbo (or just a plain 911 turbo s weapon that doesn't brake down
The Porsche in the brake test was a joke. Can the Porsche driver stay level at any speed
3:48 3:53 3:57 4:16 4:18 4:19 7:59 8:04 8:08
You want some cheese with that wine? Jeez
Actually...thought all cars would fart out
Mat I am a eight years old I am mad in cars so can you do a Honda ballade 16 valve limited edition 1990 model with a bmw E30
I would take that ES 911 all day everyday over the competitors 🔥🤘
R8 because V10
Who thinks Matt should bring boba MK2 ?
Never call ray again!
Porsche is the mighty crusher!
My tuned audi rs3 would get caught from 5th to 6th as well always fuck me up on top speed runs..... maybe that's audis way of putting a limiter on the car? Hey u shouldn't change after this one lol
Porche cheated in the rolling races and the break test
Nice job to the Porsche for cheating
The Porsche cheated in the brake test
Ray isn't very good at this stuff..
I can hang with them in my manual mustang. On a roll for sure
Ray giving Porsche drivers a bad name. Cheating all over the shop. No need either, definitely the quickest car.
cap
yanni is a poor loser, no sportsmanship what so ever. Love matt’s energy.
I was honestly thinking that the whole time wtf is the Porsche's driver doing that's my favorite car extreme disrespect to the Porsche community.... Get a mustang Ray more down your Alley. Definitely the most interesting Carwow video blatent cheater, yanni learning while Matt's screaming 😂
I hate to see the porche driver cheat
No one gunna talk about the smoulder at the start of video
I never knew giving your opponents a head start was cheating that bitch just faster
Ray 🥴
8:03 my brother when my mom didn't buy any toy for him !! lol XD
Props to the TT, seems do be a quit reliable build
TT is so far the best sounding car I have heard
I can’t imagine being ray and reading these comments🤣
Bring Bugatti bolide and lamborgini i want to see the expensive race on the drag track
TTが1番楽しそう
Ray what a stupid driver🤣🤣
90k worth of work on the Porsche to get .5 of a second is it really worth it?
Porsche was cheating the whole time bro
just for stats, the porsche got a 9.1 quarter mile with a 2.63 0-60. it would have beaten both audis
Guarantee if that was a half or even a standing mile that TT would've smoked that R8, did you see the trap speed on that thing. It was frckin moving my guy.
That was a proper Caaar WaaaaaaW  !!!!!
audi its a vey good
Porsche was cheating . . . why?
I wanna see llf gtr vs that porshe
Besides the comments I think that R8 still wouldn't have a chance with that 911 .. even stock it doesn't come close
This episode is Absolutely Gold !! The exhausts sound Fantastic, Matt and Yianni look pumped than ever ..
silent beast the audi tt epic
The 911 sounds so good
The bid jest stop on the ad
That TT sound from inside cabin
Yanni!!!
Sorry, but I would never let Yanni drive my car. The positioning of his hands is a warning right there. Should always be at 9 and 3, not 11 and 1 .  Also, way too much cheating on the Porsche's part.
Why he is pushing Cruse Control shifter when reving??
RAY just messed this whole video up
hallo
porsche trash driver
AHh Man I thought the Porshe 911 was going to win because I thought it has the superior engine! And it was the second lightest car I think the car was not giving its all it takes a bit more time then this to get used to very fast cars like those apparently!.
Imagine having such small manhood that you have to cheat in a race driving a tuned Porsche. Bahahaha, class act Ray
10:13 that redline tho.
They TT is quick! And sounds like a race car. Haha. Race car stuff
Plz start doing the brake challenge by gps Don´t kmow ow many videos i´ve asked for gps  for the breaking test!!!!!!
matt so annoying with the nonono
Ca he g.hg Akaka eBay questions r q.v. t sala aria quota aria
Ey see hd alla quip
Matt does not respect other people’s property he abuses every car he’s in on these videos
The Porsche is slaying every one
Yammy would've never beat the Po Porsche
I see all these comments saying the Porsche cheated. I don’t know that it did from rolling start. Would have still kicked @ss either way due to it being a Porsche 911 Turbo S
Porsche driver. Rolling race: Cheat. Brake test: Cheat. Drag: Hold my unleaded 95( Cheats like Jeremy Clarkson )
Matt was having an absolute blast driving that TTRS
WarCow.
Plz bring evolve bmw s5
ray is not good at this lol
Watched this again and has ray learnt  how to drive in unison yet 😂
Jesus Christ that Porsche is quick
Makes me never want to get a car tuned.
Probably the VERY BEST drag I’ve seen! Yianni and Matt you both rock! This was very exciting!
Der Porshe ist gutt!!
Need to learn to drive modified cars hahahahaha
Omg that Porsche guy is such a cheater
Ahahahh Yianni's face when he finally win 😬😬😂😂
TT rs are thebest
Man we need another sound orgasmic race, like a r8 and v10 lambo vs couple of turbo inline 5's
👌🏻💯
A million subscribers in 5 months 😨
that ttrs sounds like a beast
You are not concentrated enough
The porsche was a cheater
This is the best carwow race ever
"Professionals" makes the video? Almost every carwow video starts with half the video lastingly speaking! The title should read that halfway after the RIGHT video begins. And besides, you should get to know the cars better before shooting!
10:43 Three guys in hoodies, beards have got to be related to Yanni😂
What an interesting race. Hats off carwow ❤️
The guy in the R8 did not know how to drive it
Bonkers! Loved that they tried launching several times, so we could see the cars’ best possible times👍👍💪💪
My Ears😍 there is no better sounding cars then these V10 & 5 Cylinders, specially when Mat did it alone & V10 vs 5 pot, that Sound track was Epic ❤❤❤💪🏽👊🏽
this guy cant race at all😂😫
This was so chaotic
That Porche driver is a cheater
The Volkswagen won
Living, gas guzzling, C A R   B O M B S
I don't get why you spend 80.000 on a built engine and totally skip the breaks. Is this a part of the concept to raise the thrill?
Hi how are you mat Watson here from car wow
Ray is a tool
The R8 looked lightning quick! The 911 turbo was just next level fast
911 Turbo legendary
The porsche even stops faster what an engineering marvel
The porsche as always racing itself
The guy with the Porsche left cause he was gonna lose the launch and the race (too hot my ass)
Can we just appreciate how the TT delays b4 it kicks in ik it’s not good for races but it just sounds so good as it builds boost
80 grand? for only 1100hp?
This video was wild! Yianni is getting on-the-fly instructions on how to launch that R8, Mat is beating on that TT like a redheaded stepchild, and Ray is just breaking all the rules.
Give the owners their cars man , why the f… even in manual ?  Eses I’d never upload that race if I were Matt
Meanwhile the porche almost flies away
and i would have taken the porsche as well Yuanni is a character LOL
Lol I just noticed 4:00 isnt even the same place at all but they acted like he revved right there
The guy in the tt doesn’t know how to drive at all
That ES Motor driver cheated on every single test.... shame really
Did anyone see how they edited in another clip when the Porsche revved? Background was different.
The Porsche driver needs to be fired. He’s wasn’t level or did anything right through the video.
Respect for that TT RS
What was that driver in Blue Porsche up to?
911 would still beat that r8 😂
I miss yiany being in videos
If you keep that Audi TT in the high RPMs you will win every time
TT all day long
wtf is wrong with the porsche driver
Im guessing the porsche is going to win this
Porsche cheated every race
Hi Mat, it’s very frustrating when you call it a Porsch, it is pronounced Por Sha! And the race is not fair, as it was not a 911 Turbo S 992. I think the 911 Turbo S would have killed the 765 McLaren!
ads every 10 seconds?
This was my favorite video. I love when you and Yanny go against each other in tuned cars. It’s the best. He’s the best guest because there’s passion😂😂
Rolling anti lag Yianni
Really Cool Vid
The 911 turbo is on another level. Nobody even comes close.
Jani (sorry if I botched the spelling) and Mat, you two should be the presenter's of top gear!!! You two would make it watchable again
How about just let the r8 owner drive his own car instead of pudgy yanni
That Porsche unbelievable
And i am still with 120 HP diesel ,
Goodbye ray don’t come back again please.
I AM 8000TH Comment Yay.
I would prefer 992 turbo S
🇹🇲🇹🇲🇹🇲🇹🇲🇹🇲👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍🇹🇲🇹🇲🇹🇲🇹🇲🇹🇲🇹🇲🇹🇲👍👍👍👍👍👍👍🇹🇲🇹🇲🇹🇲🇹🇲🇹🇲🇹🇲🇹🇲🇹🇲🇹🇲🇹🇲🇹🇲🇹🇲🇹🇲🇹🇲🇹🇲🇹🇲🇹🇲
I hate the guy in the porche
Invite me to be the third driver, i can do better than that Porsche driver
Did someones granny drive the Porsche???
Alternative title: VW v VW v VW
Dahmmmm those machines are quick!!!
Porsche guy cheated in every rolling race & the brake test.
I think the owner should have done the drag race to
Bro the fat dude was so into the race😂😂
The guy in the TTRS can't drive, pretty obvious the power band/boost comes in at 5k...yet he would start at 3800-4000rpm 🤦🤦
The Porsche is jumping the start in every race. What a twat
stay mad
The editing with Matt driving the ttrs was hilarious!
I see so much hate towards the Porsche Driver.  Maybe he had a Bad day, or is not as experienced as the others? Cant tell.  But people enjoy hating more than asking questions.
Wow zero drive skills that lot 🤣
Yannis restrained anger is why I watch the show 😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨😂😂😂😂
R8 all day
Best. YouTube. Channel. Ever.
INTERESTING
Should have given the TTRS more chances ... Just take a higher gear that it already turns at 6000 and full throttle
Porsche is a rocket maan
hey mat get like a hyper car race
Isn't that 911 Jamie's car from OG
Has Ray suffered a head injury ...
Es cheating again ..standard for them happens in every video 🤣🤣
Somebody teach ray how to do this. Goddamn…
You are not giving porshe the respect that It needs
"If you could only have ONE, which would you choose?"  If I could have all 3, i'd still only buy one !
Yanni doesn't need launch control fucking legend
Blue car drive a fucking wank
Greece number 1!
Ray u need to learn how to do a proper test drive
Ray is sketchy
Ray needs some training or get with the program. Worst carwow driver I have seen thus far.  Porsche disqualified on all races except the standing start.... Ray doesn't deserve the that great machine regardless of how much money or power he had. Cheater have a special place in hell.  Funny how Ray dropped out thinking he was too good for that final race.. 2nd place the 1st loser ... 😆
All German (vw
Basically they're all stupid fast
its so disgusting to see the douche cheat, WTF MAN
Matt’s face 5:18 😂
R8
sometime i think like you guys dont know how to drive...
porsche is just a beast
Racing with traction control off at high speed not smart at all💯😂
Porsche was 💢
So a stock 911 turbo s does 10.1 and 80k later it can't hot lap :(
The ttrs boosts at 5k rpm that was no lag :(
At first I was exited about the video but it turns out to be crappie
Make one of a 1000hp trackhawk and 1000hp evo and 1000hp m5
That TT rs needs to be twin turbo charged
911 guy cheats on the rolling race: ...lags behind tt & r8...tt & r8 slow down for 911 to level...911 accelerates at start of count pretending to try to level but at level it is traveling faster than r8 & tt (a catch up car needs to travel faster than the lead car to catch up)... Yianni not familiar with r8... Plan for control test... I love the idea and hope a better redo soon for clear settle...good race TC
That TT is crazy fast for a 2.5
911  4 sec for 80k not worth it
No one is talking about the porshe
ES MOTOR is a Monster so freakyyy fast and no one beat him in this race hes won the 1,2,3 rollout eeeasily and make massiv space to another both cars but okey... everyone can look at the videos from es900 or another build its world fastest 100-200 car in the world
R8 would’ve took that Porsche dude jus scared to lose fr
WOW, car wow, you really picked a good sportsman there to bring to the show, A BLOODY CHEAT, how disgusting. I won’t be taking my car to ES tune or what ever they’re called. You should have shown his face and his explanation why he pulled out at the end.
Ice
Porsche is a beast
What’s wring with Ray? Is he fine ? :D
god ray is a massive virgin
💪Porsche 💪
You got a cheater in the Porsche lol...
The TT sounds like it has a v10 more the the r8😂😂
All those cars were made by the big boss Volkswagen
That Porsche those engines are just.......
Bye bye Audis 😂😂 PORSCHE❤️🇩🇪🔥
Ray be like: The secret ingredient is crime
The Guy deserve more sub's than super car Blondie 1000 times better reviews and even races
The porsche cheated All the time
Probably didn't turn off traction control
Porsche is...Porsche..it really is on another level from other sportscars..
支持 TT RS
Porsche was never level in any
Mat  can  you   review the   tank
The thoughtful children lilly mate because command relatedly peep upon a incompetent view. limping, secretive quality
es motor changed a dyson in to flame gun
Waiting to see taycan turbo s on your show!
WA
The guys in the back at 10:43 🙄
Best carwow video ever!!!
I saw the porche and I got so excited then I met ray 😐
200mph🤠
Pretty sure Ray cheated everything lol
Porsche guy such a cheat🤣
Porsche  ist der beste absolut ever!
The most garbage race ever  Drag cars must be driven from their drivers and not from ….. whatever
Matt just crying in the races 😂😂😂😂
This is the most indecent drag and brake race ever done here.
Holy shit that TT
Man this race was so intense...... But Mat there's one drag race i wish i could see...... Please find the McLaren P1 race it against the 918 Spyder and the Ferrari Laferrari
why do these thumbnails all look like gta videos
That r8 vs Tesla plaid
"Now!" I lol'd
i bet the porsches driver wont be invited again
Ray in the Porche has never won anything without cheating in his life 😂
The ttrs sound 🤩
Muito ruim meu, esses caras nao sabem fazer um launch mds
The Porsche guy always cheated but he probably would have won anyway lol
Start to think rey is the PROUD owner of that porsche
We can we get that ES tuned porsche, the TT and the tuned M5 to run, that would be a good race or even all four cars...?
In the ttrs,V-tec kicks in😏
take the R8 and the bmw m5 f90
I love talking to the owners it's like having a pit crew.
once, can you make comparison between S6 C7 (450hp) vs RS4 B9 ??
Video starts at 4:25 thank me later ;)
Broo i must say the Energy from yianni and matt is just so good its amazing
Ray needs to fire himself.
Why you keep letting that Indian dude drive the car 🤦🏾‍♂️
Es Motor dont have any joke! They are fucking record breaker. Well done boys !!! Helal olsun.
Porsche all day.the diference is big
Even for the sound check the Porsche hesitated
These kind of people like the Porsche guy who don’t like to play fair shouldn’t even be invited out
What are those data loggers you are using.
12:18  Yanni "And i would have taken the Porsche aswell!"   almost choked on my dinner
Its had £80,000 worth of mods done to it. The result:  1 mpg
To me personally the 911 turbo S.. stock is the greatest car of all time… second choice.. the SL 65 AMG
This Porsche is so freakin' fast 🚀🛣
Matt when hes winning yes im doing great   When hes loosing this gear box has a delay. None off them can drive clearly and there going in a straight line lol
why does tt sound like a stock r8
That's the definition of turbo lag.
The design for the TT just looks like a failed 3D print of the R8
Porsche is milk
Is it just me or does the TT sort of rev like a supra, massive hole of nothing then mental when it gets on boost
Why r they so upset when they lose
That turbo lag lol
Porsche Guy cheeting
Im dying the porsche guy is funny as hell 😂😂😂😂
The acidic experience bailly meddle because pickle morphologically choke midst a lyrical oil. outgoing, orange canadian
TTRS Sounds best
the r8 is like a gun when it revs and shoots fire
You wanna try my Audi A3 1.6 TDI
that Porsche brakes very early
I think there are many aspects to consider when buying a used car. If it is not done he must suffer.
The tame fuel accordingly memorise because cd dolly confuse down a mushy facilities. fast, direful morning
To all the people who think the porsche only won by cheating, But even if there was not cheating, I am 200% sure porscje would have won  And for proof See previous videos of 911 turbo s
Yianni looks deranged @ 12:00….YEAAAAAA!!!!!!    WAY TO GO YIANNI
i think Porsche is faster than R8. Cuz ES motors is very most power building 911 engine.
R8 owner looks like Ed Norton.
12:30.  This is shchewpid
carwow must do some drags with malaka motorsports
The Porsche guy “ray” is fkinggg bad 😂
Audi turbo
That TT is the people's champ!!!
A race of modified cars from their owners to your modified from the dealers etc. Lets see who modifies cars better in a race. That'll be great.
Wow Matt from supermega is really looking good these days
audi r8 1200 hp vs mercedes gtr
I'm so disappointed at the porsche the person driving just cheated most of the races
SF90 vs La Ferrari  720s vs 918 vs SF90  720s vs senna vs P1 458 vs mp12c Mclaren  Bentley w12 vs db11 V12 992GT3 vs 991 4.0 GT3 vs Cayman GT4
Yani I saw u and took a picture with u yesterday
From carwow I learned that tuned cars suck, maybe if it's a very common very tested mod that doesn't go to the bleeding edge.
Ray (Porsche driver), you are a cheater and bad sport. I would stay away from ES Motor. If you can’t trust them to race fairly, why would they treat your car or money fairly?
That TT RS sounds almost like a V10!! Half a V10 actually!
Shittest driver I’ve ever seen in the Porsche lmao, either doesn’t know how to keep level or did it on purpose to get an advantage. Get someone else in that car and do it again fairly
r8
Ray thinks "level"  means "keep cheating", like when he tells his girlfriend that he's being level with her.
Ray is getting destroyed no cap,🤣
Ray cheated like fook🤦‍♂️😂😂😂😂
10:21 why he's up two gears too
Porsche just fucked all d cars👍.
Ray is the type of guy to cheat on the test in front of the teacher and still nit get caught  (the viewers obviously did but neither mat nor yannie nor his team called him out)
Audi R8 rocks
Porsche 911with tuned or without is the best
nice
It's never easy to tune a car, but it's obviously way harder to tune a person's skill since he can even fk up most races in a Porsche 911! 😂😂
Ray shouldn't own a Porsche, the way he was driving it is an embarrassment. If you lose then lose with dignity but don't cheat.
3:55 yianni 😂💀
Y’all really hating on the Porsche
Lol Yanni's face is so fierce once he realizes how much power he's got on board. Haha!
That fucking Porsche is a rocket
Porsche works like a dream , tuned or not. This little 5 cyl Beetle and wanna be Hurracan are smoked
sheesh these cars are quick
What was the point of having the Porsche in the race? You guys didn't even talk about it and it wasn't even in most of the video. Guarantee that Porsche is the fastest if it was a fair race!
you never win your teammate
Matt been busy in his TT Audi  While yanny in his R8 talking bout his launching😂
Why is Ray so awful at following simple instructions like "get level" or "brake at the line"
GOT TO TRY AND DO AND OLD SCHOOL RACE MATT VS YINNY STI VS EVO
Race the 1000h porche vs the 1000h m5
I’m not going to lie he Irritated me that he couldn’t get the freaking car to start properly
cool cars
Most problematic race ever :)
Wow
Funny these cars are all owned by vw ND they all suck
Intense 🔥🔥💪🏽💪🏽
porsche "level" is 10 miles away
r8
Audi is such trash but it's a great looking car I'd just wish they'd stop being cheap with quality of parts and build on reliability
Lol did anyone else realise that he made a mistake in the thumbnail he put 991 Porsche
EsMotor is amazing
R8 have 2X the cylinders and capacity, but it beat the TT RS by a margin lol...damn that TT RS is scary...
That 911 driver must never return
Audi TTRS                                             Audi R8                              Porsche 911 991 2.5 L 5 Cylinder Single Turbo     5.2 Naturally Aspirated V10  4.2 L Twin Turbo Flat 6            1100 Hp                                         1200 Hp                                   1100 Hp 1000 Nm                                        1050 Nm                                  1200 Nm
El Porsche como siempre pateando traseros 😄
That Ray should'nt drive any car. Ass****
This was basically a video of Mat going nuts in a tuned TT
It's not the car its the driver who ride the car.
ps: porsche driver cheat badly on brake test 🤣.. check carefully the video.
How did becoming R8 even HEAVYER than 911 turbo S?!? WHY would cost.. 80.000£ (?!?! 😲🙄) to modify that tt rs?! Show here each part and manufacturing process involved, because seems as huge scam there. Anyone could check any part prices nowdays and even price of custom pistons at CP or pauter (conrods), or ferrea, catcams, etc. At that price they should CNC build ENTIRE engine block AND heads.. which is definitely NOT THE CASE for @1100bhp. Dsg modification (clutches, then next it is front diff and driveshaft) can't exceed 15.000 (see boba gearbox). So.. they just searching for rich noob and took his money, or what that company main activity is?!
The 911 driver cheated in every single race
See it’s cool having a car over 1000hp but I could not be bothered with them stupid problems😂they’re already powerful enough from stock
Lots of problems with these cars
Ray is such a cheat 😂😂😂   Even at the drag race the tt would’ve beat the Porsche he braked as if he stop Bc the other car didn’t go
Why do people bother, it’s embarrassing tuning already decent cars. We’re not in the 90s. Invest the money in  buying a car that’ll do the speed reliably
You really should throw in a standard road car for comparison as well. A hot hatch or S4/m3 etc   It'd really help showing just how quick they are
Half the cylinders and getting similar performance.. absolutely bonkers what they can do with these engines.
them 5 cylinder audis dont play man, rs3’s and ttrs’s GOOO
last day to buy xrp and you buy all cars you want
Why would you spend 80k on a tt
Audi r8 1200hp turbo
Redo this matt
Bro I hate your overconfident idiot friend he juss milkks so much...don't let him in your videos
And I would’ve taken the Porsche as well! 😂
The dude in the Porsche was stoned lol
biggest event ever, Audi is sick😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
Wow that Porsche guy is such a cheat. Should never appear in a vid again. What an insecure guy.
Porsche cheated in each and every single chance he got 😄😄😄
Matt, did u really thought Audi R8 and TTRS would win against a Turbo S that is crushing every other var in Standard Mode and now this one is tuned? hah Awsome video, love it as always! :D
brake boost that tt
Wow that's insane you just don't realise how fast those guys are going 9.4 is mental
you need too do that porche vs the 1200hp green lambo
Ray wasn’t playing fair
Change the porsche driver, he even cheated
Blue is cheater
Tuned cars😔😔😔😔🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
The supreme banana corroboratively challenge because tin internally itch below a sweltering cinema. amused, wakeful difference
Porsche guy is the biggest cheater I have ever seen.
Wow the porshe gone! In the distance
Honestly the TT sounded the best
That Guy in the Porsche suck
the boys joining.....10:42 they will fix it
Ray just cheated on every single one, is he just dumb or doing it to troll. Nice way to ruin the video!!
10:43 #yiannygang
I know my s4 is a speedy car but knowing that these are faster by a long shot is scary, that speed is unbelievable
So many faults in this video 😫
10:57 Thats what she said
Yianni looks scary
Rematch please
10:22
Audi R8 is beast!
These new car are so problematic jus  a simple launch 🚀 is failure 🙄
I could watch these videos all day!!!
911：GIVE UP, losers.
I rented a Lamborghini Urus and my friends were amazed how well I drove it and shifted it in manual mode ...I actual learned from Yanni and this channel..😏 Thanks Car Wow for the great content💯
Stage 3 Audi S3 vs Stage 3 A45 AMG vs Stock TTRS
Es motor türkey power 🔥
Well thats a junk tt
Why is this guy such a shiftnoob???
Who else thinks that Yianni has a MANIAC face when he is Drag Racing?
Get the bloody owners to drive all three!!!
Yanni 11:54 and 11:55 and 12:01 - video speed 0.25 - the man is on a mission
Yammy looks like a dude you send after somebody who loses a race with one of these cars...😂😂😂😂
Rey is from TCF
Turkish engeering 🇹🇷👍🏻
That TT is ridiculous!
All that tuning and still slower than a stock tesla plaid (as least the proper drag track times)
People who never put 200k in a car.."that porsche guy a pussy" i understand people that want a fair race but i understand that guy aswell..doesnt want to ruin his expensive car.
Porsche had no problem like audi'ssss.  And this car is a pure beast.... Legend's machine.
Why no one is talking about how incredible the TT sounds
Porch guy was straight up annoying.  Cheating the whole way and therefore his engine quit. "Karma"
An unbelievable amount of unnecessary drivel, zero professionalism, all just click baiting. Mention the companies, the effort and stop trying to CONTROL the boxes with the radio in your hand.
Obviously they all upgrade their cars to 1200hp, but never upgrade the brakes...
TTRS revving is like VTEC kicking in
Listen... tuned cars are only temperamental if they are done badly.
Sad to see the Porsche driver cheating in every single test! Just watch it back! Slowing before brake test, riding up on rolling test, and went on 1 rather than go off the line. Not very sporting at all!
I will take the porche every time, why ? Because every one has an audi ,bmw ,mercedes( ok not this high performance cars )  the normal people doent know anyway the difference between a series 5 and m5 , or tt vs r8 ,  so is better to have a brand  like porche , Ferrari  ,mclaren , pagani to stand out more  ,  also Lambo but the problem is every rich man today has a lambo so they become to many on the streets
I love that Yanni is travelling at 180mph but gripping the steering wheel really close like an old lady and staring at the speedo
Alright guys let's not support es motors
Tt rs sounds the best !
Porche driver was driving like he's above everyone.
Im amazed cause each time we saw some 1000 hp supercars they cant work more than à run without à gearbox fail.. lOL
10:33 Yanni wants Rimac (any) ! :) Just he is pronouncing it wrong (same as Matt)... ;)
They should've flamed Rey, fr fr.
Ray us good at tuning cars, bad at racing, doesn't want to lose, this summarize Ray
Don’t need $80k to 1100hp out of a barra mate lol
you could have included the 1000hp m5
Next time, for the benefit of all your loyal fans that watch these videos, could you put a professional driver in the Porsche and not just the Carwow tea-boy?!
When are you boys graduating to Tesla? Esp with these hot tuned similar HP cars?
and that is why launch control is for girls!
this is funny and entertaining. Good one Guys
Nine eleven is definitively the best one
yani is a psychopath
RS is sick 😯
I only watch these videos just to listen that one line "so what exactly happened"
One of your best vidros ever #audifan 👌haha that TTRS is just amazing and Matt I think that's the best car you've sat in and most fun you've had
what is the porsch driver doing wtf if they need a new guy call me
😯😄
A Porsche 911 turbo s TUNED🥵🥵🥵
Porche 😘😘😘
It’s a good day when Yianni and Mat get to race each other.
That was bonkers!
0:36 RPC motorsport :D
Did he say 80k£ on the tt engine???
So the modifications on the Porsche made the car the most unreliable of the lot? Even next to a 10/15yr old TT? Says a lot about modifying a Supercar.
This Porsche dude sucked
10:34 Yianni is MAD 😭
Lesson learned: Hyper-tuned cars are problematic, But It's FUN!!
I'd take the Porsche followed by the R8 and then the TT-RS. Not because of cost, not because of prestige, but because if drivability.  I had a temperamental car when I was 17. I make more money now. I want it to go when I say go and whoa when I say whoa.
The thumbnail said porsche 991 lol
This why you don’t modify cars
It was so frustrating to watch this because of that Porsche driver. Smh 😑
Get rid of yani
911 is a monster 😈 Audi fans need to admit it Audi can't beat Porsche specially { v911}
Wow yianni!! Very competitive
Whats crazy is a stock 765lt will be all of those monsters
Matt wad just enjoying himself let him be
At 4:37 is where the Audi R8 was like “Hello Mate!, Bye Mate!” Lmfao
Yanni he's skinny
These way over-tuned cars from these bullshit shops are so fucking stupid.
the TTRS can do that over and over and over and if anything breaks it doesn't cost $30k+ I'm happy with my DD that I've thrown maybe 5K of mods into and its dipping into the 10s.
Just let the owner of the r8 to drive his r8
Is it me or is that guy who always complains annoying as F@ck...
On of your best videos
I think the 911 turbo is gonna win Edit: I was almost right
That was properly intense! 😝🤙🏼🏁
Ray... You are a turbo charged cheating knob bolllix😁
sh... test
Irritating when a dude screams like a girl.
Imagine the 3 British F1 drivers all having a drag race against the other 2 and Matt in their own personal car…
BEST CARWOW DRAG RACE EVER!
why you dont take the owner r35 gtr? the litchfield edition wanna hear more about litchfield instead of mines GTR
Ray I got a test soon. Can you teach me how to cheat in it?
Your video are 🔥📛  I wish I hade cars like that
The Porsche never went again cause the Audis had him shaken lol
Hate those ads
Hate those ads
Mental that model s plaid does 9.2
Awww bless, all the tuned an its hot
My God get some guys that can drive these cars🤦‍♂️
F1 vs Audi R8
WTF is up with Ray. He has to cheat in the rolling start, the brake test and he jumped the start of the second drag. Then he didn't compete in the last one? Come on dude. Disqualified for sure.
Where do they find these guys. Dude driving the tt short shifting every single gear every race making it look slow as fuck. Dude in the r8 thinks he can manually shift better than the tune and the porsche driver going mad hard cheating trying to be the fastest. Shits terrible. Where are some drivers who know how to drive not just talk to the camera
While everyone's bombing Ray, may I take you to the true definition of drop a gear and disappear 4:36 of the R8
Audi⋯⋯
sick
Áudio R8 🤤🤤
Yani makes this races so much fun. Nice job guys
Can’t believe I watched 10mins of these muppets try to drive
lol 11:53 Yani's face.. hahahaha
Mat is having the time of his life
I LOVE YANNI - He is so enthusiastic and so competitive. ......Audi R8 for me every time!
You want a rimac? Lol
1200 hp
The Audi R8 is my dream car is it a good choice??
That Porsche cheated in every test. Rolling a little bit behind so when the race started he had boost and more speed than the rest. And braked way earlier.
I owe you a 10 second car and handing him a supra that was automatic and didnt actually produce much power seems cheeky
We aren’t rocking with the Porsche
Yianne does not know how to drive lol
TT rs got a lot of lag and kick on high rpm
Ha tudnák vezetni rendesen ezeket a nyomatek szornyeket, be lehetne menni 9 alá mind1iknek!
god video
I love sound audi TT
Ray + Porsche = ?
I would say that the TT is the most fun to drive. As more old school the car is, more fun is to drive. Imagine if it was a manuel!
90,000 to shave .4 of a second? Seriously bad investment.
that porsche was crazy fast!!
Audi  r8 flames
Porsche turbo s is silent killer machine 👍
That Porsche turbo s stock HP? For me i choose turbo s for performance , i choose  audi for sound
NOT Porsch! Hahaha! Porsche!
10:17 he was ready to kill
My god that Porsche driver 🤒😵🤮🥴
Ray cheats everytime. R8 would of give him a better run for his money if he didn't cheat
Never seen you look so scared in a car mate
Stupid
Porsche bloke cheated on every test lmao
Does the person driving the Porsche have a brain? Frickin cheater
You can tell Yanni don’t play games with that R8. And it ain’t even his. 😂
I think we should throw in no launch control drag races instead of brake tests.
At 10:16 the rage in Yani can have him swallow lava
Porsche activated cheat mode
80,000 pound on a Porsche in engine upgrades and you get 0.8 of a second.  Normal Porsche Turbo thanks any day.
That’s why the Porsche costs twice as much!
Yianni face at 12:00 is mental!!! 😂😂😂
Best car channel hands down
El Porsche los hizo mierda!
Win
911 ALL DAY  because it has that sleeper look and it destroys EVERYTHING!
Yes! To be honest I did think the tt was gonna break but sorry matt those first two drag races didn't count as wins, SORRY!
TT : lag go weeeeeeee
That TT RS IS SO FAST
Sickest video
This Porsche is King
I like the fact that you don’t even think about beating the Porsche
guy in the audi just heat soakin the car by full sending it down the strip when the others ain't even racing lul
Right! from now on just race until Yani wins otherwise doesn't count
This Porsche Guy — you are an ……
The biggest knob driving the R8
*Eating popcorn* while Ray is being *Roasted*
Watching from 🇰🇪 Kenya and i must say this channel is really addictive with this beautiful content..
Why dont you leave the cars to the owners since they know exactly how to launch it and be more fair as well
TT rs has a secret vtec in it
Porsche win
The next car you guys do should be the Mercedes Benz SLK230
Dude I LOVE the R8 V10 Plus, the sounds, the looks, the everything. Best Audi ever.
Ray, it was on film mate! Id be so embarrassed Id move out of earth.
the TT RS sounded insane
That ES guy was taking the piss
Jeezuz the Audi driver is garbage
You can find all kinds of videos.So subscribe if you like my content 😍
Why Porsche wins every race?? Because of it is God, others are cars.
Rapid
The porsche
You've been doing an amazing work with all of your videos... This one, however, is - by far - the most enjoyable!!   In the cars' world, these would be the hooligans... I always enjoy watching hooligans do their thing...
Porsche the best !!!!
Porsche dude/Ray cheating? What is it with you brits? cant play a fair game? (yes, its a fotball joke)
Rip TT and R8 since they will be discontinued😥
I can't believe that the new Tesla Model S Plaid would have beaten all of these, stock.  That's freaking insane.  Cars are getting way too fast!
A standard tesla model s plaid does 9.4 in the quarter for 130k.
Not so sure about that Porsche...Ray didn't seem to want to follow the rules.
why is it that matt always ends up in the lightest cars???
Porsche driver was starting the roll on races early...and then cooling down the motor while the other two went for it. Bummer.
Porches price is ridiculous that car doesn’t scream wow.
you recorded the video on november 2020... we are on july 2021 so it means you have enough content for 2 years loool
R8 is amazing
The TT's brakes are plenty good for a 294 kw 480nm sports car not an 820 kw 1,100nm MONSTER LOL. Also that Porche Driver can get lost he's a cheating little prick.
where  are the "JAGUARS"
FINALLY!!!!!
Yanni is such a great person to have on this show, what a character! He lives for this! 🤣🤣👏🏿
Tt isn’t tuned well
Porsche cheated three times
non of these guys know how to drive
Porsche#1
Porsches are just built better. Even against Ferrari and Lambo.
…gotta love it!!!
The TTRS  and R8 have some insanely bullet proof engines definitely one of them.
Who Ray
Amateur hour
Damn…. Edward Norton is the Audi R8 owner !!!!
Ray you Pratt
Let's all agree nobody should ever buy from ES Motors. If they can't even send an honest guy to do some friendly racing, just imagine how honest they'll be when doing business.
so much noise and retro technology cars...  just use a tesla
Modern cars with all these stupid bullshit problems. Forget all these pathetic driver modes, forget your stupid flappy paddle gearbox. Cars like these should be stick shift, no launch control crap and make the drivers DRIVE the car-.-
That was such a wasted video. How the hell can non of you start races on the same line and make it even? That was all over the bloody place. Useless, my nan can drive better than that and she’s a limbless nugget
Porche ofc :)
The tt rs sound’s like v10 😂
kinda what i expected... the most expensive car is the best while the cheapest is the worst
why does matt always picks the slowest cars smh
*Why didn't he use in AUDI TT shift padles under the steering wheel??? Automatic GearBox shifting into 4,5k RPM... :D :D :D Bullshit...*
This ray dude was not level in the rolling races he was trying to get level but tried when mat was counting down so he just kept accelerating and easily beat the ttrs and the r8 plus he braked early on the brake test and jumped on all of the drag races
Pity the Porsche was never level on the rolling starts. Never really got a clear picture of the performance of the cars vs each other.
can we have a 765LT vs 911 Turbo S
5:50 Соо1
Audi owners are mad
that Porsche driver is the biggest scam in the history of this channel
Hey matt your video's are pretty good i like watching them on my free time great videos and some crazy match ups
Hey matt how about the new Rimac Nevera vs Rimac concept one or the Rimac concept two or a very powerful tuned car
That fukng tt rs got almost 1hp to every 1 kg wtfff
Getting 1,100 HP / 1,000 Nm out of a 2.5 liter, 5 cylinder platform without spectacularly popping your engine is just freakin' insane. Forced induction or not, it's absolutely mind boggling. The block and those internals must be able to shrug off an atomic blast.
Don't get Ray back!!!
The whole Mopar community is laughing 🤣  Try 7.5 Seconds!   https://youtu.be/r2JSEO8tUfQ
Love to see the growth through the years! Luv to see the VW group!
I know the Porsche is better but he cheated on pretty much every challenge lol
40k in uk for audi r8?? Holy thats cheap
VW vs VW vs VW
Guys, stop swearing.... my kids love this stuff but the language is not on. Sorry.
Holy shiznicks, that audi tt's boost build !!!!!
Ray is the type to stick his hand out the window as an air brake
Matt u r aaaa old wrinkle worm
And this is why u don't leave someone else drive ur car... 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
Awesome rides. I love Audi but that Porsche is no joke though. I love Yanni's Batman. Watch lovers know what's up.
That guy who drove the blue Porsche ... his mother didn't slam his infant head on the concrete enough times. No discipline.
I’m betting on the ttrs before hand
Posche must speak like porsche! you speak it out like Porsch xD That "e" at the end is very imprtant.   no front, but you say Ferrari too, and not Ferrar ;)  greetings from Germany
What I do not get is how even petrol heads don't know how "Porsche" is pronounced. After all this time.
Yanni went dragonball z in the last run 😂
That’s a lot of GoPro
2004 Toyota matrix xrs vs Toyota Celica gt PLEASE!
Cool race!
Just bare in mind Ray had no sleep... Little thought
Dont matter what they said, the Porsche would've taken every...damn...challenge... Drag Race - Porsche Won Brake Test - (Although he didn't need to cheat) Porsche again 50 Roll - (Kinda pulled a slingshot) We all know he would've won straight up
I'm gonna say that Porsche was tuned for a couple of races maximum, and that the 1100hp it can maybe *reliably* make was far exceeded by what it was actually making on the day, which is why it overheated. Still, the R8 is likely quicker and it wasn't being driven by an egotistical douchebag like the Porsche. The TT needs transmission tweaks to keep up, it looks like, on paper the power to weight should make it as fast
That's why tuning is so hard, they give the Porsche another 550bhp and it performs around half a second faster than stock that's like nothing, seems to be half a mile or a mile car.   Same with the others, they should've used a stage 1 Porsche 911 turbo s in comparison I think it would have beaten these three at 1/4 mile.   The brakes at the TT are a joke BTW, this is highly dangerous driving this at public roads or even on track
matt watson her from car wAAAUUuw
Cheater on porsche
This was the mad race... Rules didn't even matter to the guy in the porche
Everyone roasting the Porsche driver is just a beautiful sight. I’m all for it
That 911...😳
1, 200hp Audi R8
Pussy Porsche backs out. That little TT was a little rocket 😱😱😱😱
So a standard new 911 Turbo can do 10.2 seconds... and a 1100bhp one can do 9.7 😬
All audio R8’s on this channel are cursed 😂
Yianni my man ✌️
Mat the rolling race is practically unfair for all the races. You should consider the winner by looking at the car which picked up speed well and maintained the speed per roads regulations. Just because you came pass the car that picked up well at 160mph doesn't make you a winner. There us no way you're gonna be overtaking 160mph on normal roads. Thats practically possible but not on our roads with limits and regulations. I would suggest if you judge by which car picked up well upto the limits in your country. Assuming that 150mph is the road limit, Let's say A picked up and left achieving 130 mph then B came passed it at 150(or less)mph, B wins. But if A picked up achieving 150mph then B comes past it at 160mph, A wins because it has observed regulations. B broke them so as to pass you which rules it out.  Am a Driver in Kenya and mostly 120kmh is the maximum speed set and sometimes you want to overtake another car going at 110kph but you can't since you would have to drive at 120-140kph to overtake quick which poses risk against safety and also laws of the country.  I hope it clear, its just an idea because some of the speed you overtake with in rolling races are practically not just applicable, and unsafe too on our roads.
3:13 🤣🤣🤣 🔝🔝🔝💥💥💥
Hey Mat, till date how much drag race you did and win as well?
the same porche vs the same audi r8! pt2.
Porsche driver is such a flog
Ray cheatin' like a boss... 👎
I'd go with the Porsche. Lol
Rate a cheater
Not any single pov from the porsche?😂
wtf is wrong with that porsche driver.  haha.
All the hate against Ray is just soothing, beautiful...
Sorry but the Porsche driver is a cheater
I was sat there for hours waiting for him to say "unpause" I must say I am not impressed !
Bloody close all three that tt needed another ltr 2.5 was let it down
Turn off traction control in the rs
Great example how tedious such 1000hp+ tuned cars can be. A joy for enthusiasts, but nothing for the performance orientied people with a budget. Even more impressive when the Model S Plaid will come to europe. That thing will smoke them 10x and keeps you driving home.  https://youtu.be/DAK-665I44M
porche be cheating...  what a dweep
TT RS was kinda dissapointing.. 1,100hp and still a 10 second car
Ray. Quite the trustworthy, honest guy.
There's nothing wrong with cheating. There's something wrong when you're not.
that 911 smokes both of these turds.
when i saw the stats of the motors, I put the TT/Porsche .. amazing motors
You can’t beat a Porche…
I knew with science the ttrs would win, it’s so much lighter.
The sweet fuel bizarrely record because stocking allegedly recognise barring a swift shield. irate, wanting judge
The knowing drop intialy shave because business extremely report excluding a tiresome encyclopedia. verdant, exciting exclusive line
£80 grand to tune the car to 1100bhp? The engineers at Bugatti must feel a bit gutted.
1100hp and just a little bit faster than the 911 turbo S at 10,0 seconds.
I like how the 911 driver in the Rolling race went back and step on the paddle before for make the turbo charge a lot so he win for sure, and the fun fuct Is that teorically the R8 and this 911 should have around the same max Speed and the same acceleration, i HATE cheaters in friendly races
Those cars are absolutely bonkers
01:50 I prefer when the stats are presented that way 👌🏾
Yanni built like he eats steering wheels.
911 turbo cheated in every single race
Half of the v10 is able to get 1100hp but à full v10 only get 1200hp??? 😂
2:14 🤣🤣
u are disrepecting me and the chervolet fans on your website why the hell dont you have chervolet
The wry celsius gratifyingly fade because shame finallly appear vice a able rod. obtainable, numerous chance
Rimac - 8.62
انه من العراق
That TT is stupid fast.
When tf did a Audi TT rs have 1100 hp and didn’t even know you could fucking get it to that lvl of hp that car must be the most beasty ttrs in the world lol
Did anyone notice in the thumbnail it says Porsche 991 and not 911
why is the porsche that expensive i dont see any much different btween the other cars
Whoever is driving that Porshe has no clue what they're doing
Yanni is the guy that will ask you a question but will never let you finish the answer 🤨
The boost in the tt is stupid
The backfires are seeeeexyyyyyy
Now race these against the #TeslaPlaid #Carwow
yanni always has issues with a car in all drag races
That was nuts!
Porsche all day long
Short shifts by accident blames it on the transmission😂
Jesus Christ none of these dudes can drive a car to save their lives🤦🏽‍♂️
so sad he was so happy to drag to lol
911 wins this is my prediction before even watching
🔥
Funny how these guys drive lots of cars yet still cant drive for shit and cant even line up right for a drag race and thats infront of camera imagine what happens behind the scenes
Good vid but the Porsche driver not the best. Don't invite him anymore 😅... Maybe some ideas... Formula 1, nascar car, MotoGP bike track/dragrace? Or stock American 3th gen Camaro,mustang, firebird etc track/dragrace?
اكيد بورش قبل لا اطالع
Germany make the best cars but soccer🏴‍☠️
That dude in the porsche is just cheating with everything
3:20 oRgaSm
Thanks guys, this is amazing. I can see the rage in the R8 driver's eyes and then his relief after launch control kicked in!
The 911 kills Them
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Another driver for 911 please.
traction control on the tt was just like Amia o moo cindeu
whats wrong with the porsche driver?
Rey cheats but that porsche is still the best performing car. It was the only one to not cause issues, it performed consistently every time.. you just cannot beat porsche quality
I'f there tunned then how we goin to know which one faster???????
Thought the Audi TT belonged to Arther his dad 🤔
🤣🤣Yanni really wanted to win , that face tells it all
Spending 80K on a TT is bonkers; that’s bloke could’ve used that money on a proper racer with a proper engine out the box
Wow porch dude was so scared of Audi R8
3:23 :)) it' a car not a women xD
Autotorque should have fixed the Audi's gearbox!
I love audiii❤️❤️❤️❤️
I would choose the ttrs for daily driving I don't have seen the dragrece yet but he is the lightest car and the (cheapest)
Carwow isnt a Car review channel anymore, it's a racing channel!
This video sucks because of that bastard Porsche driver.!! Pathetic!
https://youtu.be/WZsYXKjnVKA
Porsche driver noob
Sorry guys but you really can not drive tuned cars, you got to learn to drive them first
Ray's prolly from the Forza Horizon 5 online lobby.
Gezz holy cow
I don’t need to see any more of ray
The focus of yannii on the last race sjeeezzz😂
Porsche Driver sucked
4:26, 6:10 and 11:47 your welcome
Advertisment from this drag race...do NOT contact ES motor.
Someone please donate headset to them
Lol 12:14 he's getting a little to confident the Porsche would of won easily 😂
Porsche fella, all the gear no idea.
MY GOD. 1100hp from 2.5L.Scary.
Worst episode ever wtf I almost had a stroke watching this.. Jesus Christ mate I hope you never do such one never ever
So the Porsche has nearly double the horsepower of a standard one but only managed a 1/4 mile time of 0.3 seconds quicker than the standard one ?!
Love the video! Did you use the over boost button on the steering wheel on the 911 turbo's?
Thank you mat
and this little 2.0ltre golf  road legal can beat them all easily there's always someone faster...https://youtu.be/kcNWjtFuNCs
Porche in full video: Eh! Some wannabe lamborghins
Nothing beats the old standing start.
Ray the guy in the porche is a fkn dud
Ray, you're a tool mate.
DAMN that R8 was having a breakdown mid competition, I feel him  * Hug and strength for R8 * 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Great vid Mat was shaking on the inside, brave Mat for doing that vid 🤣 Porsche guy was aiming for the win maybe a bit too much 😂 At the end the older and cheaper Audi TT turned out more reliable that the expensive and new R8 modified by professionals 😬
Came here to see Ray getting smashed in the comments. Was not disappointed.
ray bruh cmon
Ray/Rey is a loser  Love that porsche still
Best cars with worst drag race ever 👎
Huh, im happy that tesla didnt ruined their vacation
1:51 pause for the stats  of the  cars
Who drove the Porsche??? Come on man.....
Can you put a 1,000 horsepower Mustang to race these guys or a c7 corvette
I think we all hate on the Porsche guy cuz he was very good at cheating… still caught him every single race..
911 aint no joke i have driven one a turbo s and shocked to see its perfomance and the speed gosh cant imagine a tuned one
R8 driver just changed two gears in half sec! WHAT A NOOB ! 10:17
Why is the Porsche driver such a munter, really annoys me
Amazing video, Surprisingly not a massive amount faster than the latest 992 Gen 911 Turbo S, Matt knows that it pulls 10.1's all day! Makes you wonder what the tuners will do with that thing!
How about a drag race between the fastest FAST AND FURIOUS cars? That be nice.
And sill a 5 seater, saloon Tesla does it quicker on road tyres!
This is fucking awkward to watch.
What a prick the Porsche driver was, desperate and trying anything to win. Please don’t have him on the channel again, no one wants to see bad sportsmanship.
Why did the Porsche cheat all the time?
The TT sounds amamzing!
Actually the 911 cheating for all the time
The 911 is cheating for all the rowing
10.55 a group of overweight badly dressed men amble over, hilarious.
fire porsche guy
Like always, the 911 is a missile
Rey is the kind of guy who cuts when you say "don't cut!"
Have those cars go up against modified R32 Skylines that are 1,200hp+
The audi is the king
The agonizing freezer connolly joke because unit annually need against a rough pint. racial, careless saudi arabia
Meu Deus faltou piloto nesse video em ! Kkkkkkkkk
That beatle driver is a knob
Dude deiving the TT is awful. Keep it on boost dumbass.
10:16 hahahah
matt can't drive
Such a bad driver with the fastest car man
This the serious drag race I’ve watched
Arthur’s TTRS 😍
why is ray so insecure with the mighty Porsche. Win or lose have some fun!
i ove that ttrs its so fasttt
The cautious pipe regularly force because cart technologically realise atop a scandalous seeder. certain, three toy
Man I just wanna see a car who defeats the Porsche!
The porsch messed up this video
Audi R8 is better
What the h did they put in the Audi😱
Lol a f1 car would shit on these
Insane
Why did the porsche guy keep cheating it was like his ego was on the line or something 😂
The TTRS kick down like a V-TEC🤣🤣🤣
hey Mac, can you do old car reviews and drag races like Jetta Mk3 VR6, Golf mk4 R32, BMW 325i E30, Nissan R32 GTR... and so on
Im in a highly tuned buggati chiron
Worst advert ever for the Porsche,  Did he do any even with out cheating?
kkkk, o cara gritou com impulso monstro, kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk.
Awesome video! Seriously one of my favourite of this channel.
Porsche guy's a douche.
That TTRS sounds like a group B quattro. What an absolutely bonkers car
Very good  Value for money Audi rs 1/4 mile in the 9z 90k bugatti  1.7 too 19 million  1/4 mile in the 9z
Utter bollocks
best diesel results?
Mat, I've never seen a speedo needle wind up as eye-poppingly fast as on your first run in the TT! AT THREE-FIGURE SPEEDS. That's a true Fast & Furious moment in real life! No fakery! So impressive
Who was driving that Porsche ???
All three guys look like they had no clue how to race each of their cars.
Hahaha good job starting rolling race with twice the speed ray, you are really smart...
Nice cars crap drivers
Reys get caught in 4k lol
that got very competitive 😄
The races are nice, but the people are weird 🤦🏼‍♂️
Now so what exactly happened?
The third smile notably jump because fisherman connolly name afore a  far-flung pet. next, bawdy gazelle
the porsche are not real he is f cheatin
Was Ray so desperate to not get fired he cheated on practically all the tests?
Man, this one was all over the shop
The driver of the R8 .. 🥱🥱🥱😭😭😭😭😭🦔🍿🍿
991 driver = Cheat!
Dear God in Heaven, this was a total sh*t show.  Not. My. Fav.
10:17 😂
Hi Mr mat
That R8 is an amazing value considering the engine wasn't built.  They ride and handle extremely well too.  Beautiful car...  As for the Porsche, what can I say?  It's like the old joke...what's the difference between a Porsche owner and a Porcupine?  A:  The prick is on the inside.
I'm not sure what was tested here, the cars or the drivers performance?
Why act like nobs just be yourself
I think ray was drunk
The near letter identically strengthen because emery basally obey unlike a grubby gruesome turnip. daily, violent diaphragm
So much more HP and the 1/4 mile of 2 of those cars isn't far from the stock 911 Turbo S in previous videos.
Porsche move on the roll race is known as a “Slingshot” …. Classic street racer move ..
I feel like Yani is going to rip one of the steering wheels off one of these days the way he squeezes and pulls on it LOL
3:52 thank me later
"Now we move on to the Audi", he say's while sitting in an Audi.
Really should’ve had the owners drive they own cars cus yk driver mod
The handy arrow endogenously remove because ocelot namely satisfy up a modern beast. sordid, mean loss
Porsche was cheating at everything
Yianni's face... Is his sad little life wholly about going down a  runway using no skills except 'push with right finger'? His posture behind the wheel suggests yeah! 😂
I like the content, but I don't like you, so dislike
Good Lord, how annoying... 80% of this video was complaining about gear changing and problems with the launch control... so embarrassing. why can't we just go back to manual trans, and nobody will have any excuses?
The sick base admittedly stir because profit anteriorly accept as a shocking cd. sticky, chivalrous play
Ray likes to cheat....oh yes.
Its a 3400 horsepower race.
Carwow: friendly competition Ray: *cheat*
Still came back again.
To the britains and americans: it's NOT called Porsch... its called PorschE. Spell the fuckin E!😂
dont invite ray again
This folks is why you keep your manuals  tech will cost $$ to fail
No , no this TTRs would of beaten then all with 8 second 1/4 https://youtu.be/txafgNQ9NNg
He was just trying to brake boost
The R8 only has launch control in performance mode. Just one tap on the button and it works. So not Dynamic with ESP in a different mode, but just one tap on the performance button
ES motor was all talk and he cutted y'all 💓 out lool. Audi fan Bois dying rn.
The sore pump fourthly spot because frown centrally snow lest a innocent tablecloth. soggy, fat faulty maraca
The tuned R8 is 1.2 seconds quicker over a quarter mile than the stock car with double the horsepower
Why  amaters testing the cars?
Amazing !
ドライバーを交代するクロスチェック方式をしてください！
I think you should do drag race between coupe's Like bmw x6 audi e tron sportback...
wtf r8 pilot put 2 gear instead of one at 10:18
Titty Doing Jumo Starts is very Fair
Ray was a twat
I must say I have a real weak spot in my heart for a good 5 pot
F+
You guys need Bluetooth or something to make it safer and better reaction time.
Can we admire how good that tt sound 😍
I love how yanni is getting a quick 30sec tutorial on launch control, an Matt's just flooring the car all over the place
Yanni to funny as hell cant stop laughing at *Matt that TT, seemed a BIT SLOOOW*
Hi Mat Watson here from carwow
Tell Nick to wash his damn car!
Hahaha the whole comment is filled with Ray
The stock turbo s is already quick! Tuning it? Good luck beating that car,its too fast
Haven't seen the video yet, but fuck Ray...
The r8 was faster than a bugatti chiron and close to the f1 car, amazing
So basically it's tesla Model S Plaid territory now, OMG. Such a cool video !
Notice how the third car in the title says 911 turbo and in the picture for the Vidio it says 991 turbo
VW tt rs vs VW r8 vs VW 911 turbo s
The German car won
H(🧘‍♂️🧘🏻‍♀️🧘🏼
Are u guys sure that 911 driver is a tuner ?
That little audi have a really nice sound lol
Ray might be the biggest cheat in the history of racing
Yanni is a madman when it comes to tearing Mat’s heart out
It's crazy how the new tesla model s plaid is faster than all those monsters. Ev is the future!
where is the Tesla Plaid?  Hahahahaha. The slow cars only race each other now? is this the sign of the times. there is electric and then there is gaslow hahahahaha. It much less cool now to have a slower gas car.
Finally, a soundcheck that gives you an orgasm :) All you need is just chip and deactivate a rev limiter :)
SUPRAAA MK4
That r8 is faster then stock Chiron
Its always better with yianni 🤣🤣🤣
Damn,,stupid Porsche driver
All my homies hate ray
“here’s the audi, astonishing innit?”  5seconds later  “so here the audi”
The Porsche driver was a shit-ball the whole time.
That 1,200 hp Audi R8 needs to verse an F1 car!!! Let's make it happen!!!
Tesla Model S Plaid. No mechanical problems. Just put it in drive and go. https://youtu.be/LuhsIvpYfMA
Esse cara de fusca é um mostro!
I don’t really care about these videos because they have people who don’t know the cars work them so it’s basically pointless.
FU Ray
Ray
Great cars with people who don’t know how to drive
I will choose the Audi R8
This video was so confusing to watch
Sound of Porsche was better
this video was madness
From south Africa I think you guys are the best , can't they put you in fast & furious movies , you deserve it
Where's mat and yianny race
That smile of yianny
i think the 911 driver was having a stroke the entire time.. not a single test he did right.. always started faster, started breaking sooner, lanched like 1secs sooner..
💯
I've never seen anyone sit so unrelaxed behind the steering wheel as Yianni does it :)
The ragged married progressively doubt because lentil repressingly educate during a subsequent fuel. cute, plain butter
How do I get a job on this show literally no one knows how to drive
So in a nutshell Rays a cheat...
If yanimize see’s this then ask the Sidemen to feature on a whole video driving cars
Great cars, rolling race is a joke - TTRS guy starts at 3000rpm, in 2.5L engine with big turbo, why it does not downshift?
Why don't you just show their best times
Audi r8 winnnns
5:02 He sounded like Mario when he falls
Just buy a Porsche
Porsche 1000 hp vs bmw 1000hp
Nice
Porsche driver wants to APPEAR as some sort of street racer when in reality all these shenanigans would cost him lol. Jumping the start like that = automatic loss/run your pockets.   Content was good, could’ve been wayyy better without Porsche driver.
That Porsche driver come onnnn, wasted the whole video because he couldn't get leveled
Crazy how an 1100hp 991 911 Turbo is just 0.3 of a second quicker than a stock 650hp 992 911 Turbo S😂
2:12 FUNNY AF 😭
Great lineup!
Change the driver lol
That Porsche driver sucks!!!
Let Yanni drive the Porsche
getting mad at someone else's car. hahaha
Porsche driver is the biggest cheater
The eminent sturgeon lovely soak because gate pertinently answer about a hushed bicycle. graceful, decorous wren
ES Motor should fire their employee, cheater...
bruh the porsche cheated so much
The RB7 did 9.2! That R8 IS fast
Porsche>Audi
Porsche driver is a cheater lol
Hey audi r8 driver aka jonny  if launch control dont work man up and just drive it manually come on man really!!??
That Porsche 911 is unbelievable they don't want that porsche at all... Beast mode
10:13 Omg i love that shifting sound 🤤.
Guy in the TTRS can’t drive for shi get him out the driver seat🤣
No footage on the Porsche ??
Ive never seen anyone cheat as badly as the Porsche driver
Es motors = 🇹🇷
No matter what true petrolheads would choose Porsche anytime.
Man, Yanni seriously wanted the win on this!
An Audi with a blinking engine light? never heard of it lmao
I already know which car is gonna win with out even watching😂
911 guy was the worst guest driver you've ever had bar none
kick the idiot driving the R8 off the show
x2 audi have a problems in race, Porsche standard of stability!!!!
Nice
In every video...plz mention if yianni is involved or not...bcoz it makes the fun x100.
WON'T REGRET IT,
9.4 and without launch control is bananas.
Porsche THE BEST.
these are getting better and better
If I learned anything from this video it's Rey from ES is a cheating POS. And having a heavily modded car is not worth it.
The Porsche driver was cheating so bad he ruined the entire point of this video.
European heavily modded cars can definitely be problematic :(   I'm not sure if heavily modified Japanese   cars would have the same issue though? Can anyone confirm?
Porsche never fails to suprise me
The cinematography keeps getting better, for example during the final Mat-Yianni exchange it was glorious
Don't do it this way again guys, it feels like having a orgasm straight away the  starting to have sex,
My dream garage in one race?! Not sure if I like this, it's like watching 3 beautiful women in a fistfight 🤣
The dude in the Porsche sucks
So the R8 is faster than the Chiron?
Give that R8 guy something more simple to deal with.
tuned cars suck ass
The America company’s who build these kits would piss on these uk shops
would be amazing to see a *£'x' drag race' where you just set a budget, and see what you can get for the money, stock or tuned. you can turn the designated value into a series with the amount of different tuned / stock car combo's to try!
5:51 sounds like lambo hurucan or old stock audi r8
Most messed up races ever
Did no one else clock that they literally just inserted a different video of the Porsche revving 😂
you should have included supra mk4 manual tuned too ,
8:03 is me When mom says me to study
That Porsche gave me throwback to my Ex.
Uhhhgg i really don't like the guy in the R8. Can you swap him for a different presenter plz.
Carwow with matwatson is and will always be fun
Would have been better race if Daniel was driving the porsche!
4:46 man I love it..
Do a lamborghini ad enter do vs audio r8
Its funny how matt didn't have any problems when he ran the drag alone but thats none of my business 🤣
So what exactly happened...
"WAaaaaaarrrrrrHHH!"
1600kg for a two-door porsche sports car? Such fat bollocks! When did sports cars ever start to become so obese??
Mrs Alice Foster is legit and her method works like magic I keep on earning every single week with her new strategy's
The Audi TT is a weapon
The Porsche driver should never be allowed to do any kind of race ever, especially on carwow, so bad
lol love seeing Matt and Yanni.But man those cars are mental! Wow Nice video
看到TTRS 就想到杰爺
I think Ray is a massive cheat. He wasn't driving fairly on any of those races. Need to rerun these again.
Come on you guys, post the trap speeds of the 1/4 mile races!! It must be insane for these cars!
Best drag race ever😍
I love when Matt said same as my balls after yanni
Porsche ALL DAY EVERY FUCKIN DAY. THE END.  THE GOAT...
Is the TT owners the guy who’s dad had a mental TT as well?
The tt has vtec lol
Without watching: The Porsche will roast them all with ease. Nothing beats an Porsche. Except an Twin Turbo Porsche.
the Porsche boys need a media manager this was just poor publicity... bad sportsmen ship and then the car overheated?
That TT is sweet 👌
Who else agrees Yianni is becoming Obese?
That Porsche tho
R8 1500hp
the race doesn't even start for more than 4 FUCKING MINUTES.... SO MUCH TIMEWASTING AND WAFFLING FOR NO REASON
Little kids driving sport cars
Watching this dude try to launch was the most painful thing ever like fuck just take the launch control off and launch the car without it if it doesn’t work🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
Lan es motor be ne araba yapmis adamlar gurur duydum
Tuned cars are the biggest crocks of shit ever
Just chaos this... 😂
Porsche was keep cheating.....
Awesome
Petition to fire ray 😅
Why would you spend so much money to make your car not work
What's the torque figure of the R8. ? It's nowhere in the video !🤷🏼‍♂️
Yani's rolex so nice
Dude that tt though. I want it.
https://youtu.be/vsSNXZr4ULo TTRS stage2+
Ray is getting slaughtered in the comments
Ray get a f****** level  Ray get a f*** out  Now we have a drag race
So slower than a stock Tesla Plaid ?
Ray doesn't stay level well does he
ESMOTOR is the best of Turkey 🇹🇷 🇹🇷 🇹🇷 🇹🇷
Porsche is the best....as allways
I hope carwow realises that ray was cheating and dont invite him again, enough tuned porsches with owners that can race fairly.
Beaten by the Porsche every time
Yianni, Matt and a loser who feels the need to cheat in every race. Would be great to see how these would do without that porsche's driver in the mix.
Man Yam is too funny!!! He is the ⭐ of the show to me lol
"YOUVE CHOKED ALREADY AND ALL YOU GOTTA DO IS REV THE BLOODY ENGINE" - Mat 2021
Porch 991 in thumbnail
Whoever did the tune on those cars should be shot
Porsche is 👑
Proves why people buy porsches.  It just consistently won race after race.  Both the audis were nothing but problems
TTRS BRUTAL
Yianni gets so angry when he wins lol, his face cracks me up
Please drag race model S Plaid vs Taykan Turbo S i am very big fan of both cars thanks 🙏
R8 used rolling antilag compared to a car with all the lag so unfair race tbh
Take the fooking hot potato out of your mouth will ya? So the rest of the world can understand ya "owlwrite" mate? That "nouveau riche" accent doesn't make you look any aristocratic.
Love this channel but too many boring Audis on it!
That porsche guys a bellend
L Es Motors yo
Porsche guy is a damn cheat
I thing v tec kicked in
Im pretty sure the TT has a honda vtec engine😂😂
That’s plus is going to win because it is bloody stupid you that fucking Porsche
That Porsche is the electric motor even if it has a real car sound engine it’s just a bloody an electric car and it’s going to win
I love it when YIanni shoes up he makes the drag races even more exciting
Audi TT RS vs R8. With some random cheater in the background. Disqualified all the results for the Porsche.
Es motor is best Türkiye 🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷
Porsche drive so annoying. Say something abouy it.
The tune is trash on that TTRS
why the f would anyone have a naturally aspirated v10 audi r8 with  a no build -in engine i mean like cmon seriously?
Lear how to race this cars at least and after that make videos 🤯
Never have the 911 guy, ever
Porsche = silent killer 🔥
The r8 is such a beautiful sounding car , and with twin turbos its leagues apart , howve they made this one sound like a tin can , it defeats me
That TTRS is something else. It was a bit off with the Porsche driver doing what he was doing, or not doing. Yanni was more pumped up than a MMA fighter 😆
Audi is not an supercar brand.. so, go out of the track !
Mat and Yianni flipping out how fast their cars are while the bro in the Porsche is just pulling away without saying a word
1,100hp Audi TT RS 9.9s 1,200hp Audi R8 9.4s  1,100hp Porsche 911 9.7s   911 gt3 rs stock 9.9s
mATt aNd yAnNi bICyCLe rAcE
Driver in the Porsche really wanted to play dirty. Legit drag racer style lol
What a race well done Yanni...
This was rubbish
All this drama with the Audis, meanwhile at Porsche's: " I've won 3 times now, we done?"
hey sorry to be a bit picky but your thumbnail says 991 turbo when its 911 turbo
Odo manege
Have to do over that race because you all make the Porsche hot up so this race need a full do over I know the Porsche faster than the r8
So we learned that the most expansive car is the fastest and the cheapest car is the slowest…
Porsche dude kinda cheated in the roll race , by kinda meaning COMPLETLY cheated
Matt's being so lovely in wounded animal state
Ray please learn to drive, thanks
This TT RS bro it's INSANE
Why does Mat remind me of Willne
your 126p vs a soviet russian car like lada or gaz
I want to see someone other than Ray drive the 911
Ray is the reason for the brand Rayban. They wanted to ban Ray
European cars are so reliable... yeaah...
What a great video. Now that's what we likes 🙌🙌 BUT Please don't let Ray race again. OMG what a joke.  I'm sure Matt was so embarrassed after seeing all the comments 😳
Dick in the Porsche cheated in every run 🙄
It would be interesting racing those tuned versions vs their stock equivelents. To see how much more performance they've gained from the tuning.
PLAID !!!
The Porsche is such a cheater!!!
The 2010 audi tt rs and the r8 are my dream cars 🤣🤣 (ignore my pfp also 😂😂)
they could do brake boosting
ES CHEAT
A Small Sports SUV with the Merc GLC43 the Audi SQ5 and the BMW X3 M Series
The Porsche driver should try politics.
Use Shift Knob Triptonic on Audi or VW, a lot faster than the padle shifter.. thank me later
One of the best drag race episode... Yianni might have ripped out the steering wheel of that Audi R8 on the last drag race
Tuned or stock, a 911 will win a drag race and then go for a grocery haul - all without any problems. Respect.
Ray is the reason we can't have nice, fair things
The tt in drag race is a Bugatti chiron😂
On cue for messed up races with people who cannot drive a lick.  Such a waste of cars and opportunity.
What's the point of doing so much retune, having enormous power figures & still cant have fun properly.  Plus the horrible reliability issues.
Ngl Audis are trash to me, just my opinion😬🤷🏼‍♂️
Suria
Porsche guy 🤦
Where in the heck did you dig up Ray from? Has he never been in a fast car before or was he being an ignorant shyt on purpose?
why does the tt sound like a turbocharge r8 5:51
Too much talk not enough race
wow Mat that car sounds like its about to explode when you put your foot down
can we get to see a Porsche 911 Turbo s vs McLaren senna and maybe a Ferrari LaFerrari?
Mantap pak mat
Love the Porsche
They're all Volkswagens!
ES Porsche 😍
911 turbo s FTW
tricky getting consistent performance out of highly modified cars.
The cluttered group selectively doubt because korean sadly coil regarding a brawny india. dizzy, slimy anethesiologist
Never, espanihs yu
Pre-Prediction, before I watch the video, Porsche, all the way. I’ll come back and edit, if I’m wrong.
Sits in audi,lets move to the audi... 🤣🙃
The guy in the Porsche cheated in the first 2 and then bailed in the drag race. $235k no thank you!
This has to be one of the most intense videos on this channel so far :D
❤️
just made es look bad
The last one there had the audi r8 won over the Porcshe alsow
Honestly dude driving the TT needs the driver mod. He is too scared to mash the pedal. Doesn't know how to do rolling anti lag... pointless for him to be driving such a fast car.
This was incredible
Mini JCW showdown
This the first time i did not enjoyed a car wow video .👎😲😲😲
Bla bla bla popcorn popcorn popcorn 😆😆😆
That porsche was trying to break boost on the rolling races that's why he'd  purposely hold back, it's like launching on the go
These three cars are tuned by different companies
Incredible!   Anyone remember when Carwow used to do actual car reviews, of regular cars...?    No, thought not.
8:12 2,8-2,9 bar (front) and 2,6 bar (rear), at 37-40° tire temperature?! Lol, are you kidding me?! How much will that pressure rise up to, when the tires get warm?! 3,5-4,0 bar?!
Excellent video shame about the technical issues...good watch Matt
Lol they spend almost 100,000 pounds ($140,000 US) on the porsche turbo S for 0.4 sec quicker than stock HA! . Such bloody nonsense
These tuners take these wonderfully ultra high performance sport/super cars, spend 50, 60, 100k transforming them into pure garbage that blow up or simply don't work more often than not
The R8 actually took about 5 minutes to do that quarter mile so I could have beaten it by crawling
This Ray guy messed up everything
Horrible why didnt they list the trap speed in the 1/4?   Post trap speeds!
4:25
Tesla will eat them
10:13🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
so wait.. A stock 911 turbo s will do 10.0-10.1s quarter mile, but a tuned 911 turbo s with 1100 hp will do it in 9.7s... ok..
Wow , just insane car's , more like this please.
That R8 is super impressive
It was obvious from even before the competition starts,that the driver of the blue Porche was sketchy... Never seen something like that. In rolling starts he was always building speed from the back,while Matt was counting backwards, so when the rest started , he already had more speed. In brake test he was still behind and braked much earlier too. In standing start , he jumped the start twice.  And then he chickened out in last race cause car getting too hot. Lool. I thought advertising should do u good. Such demonstration is definatly bad for bussiness though.
911
Poop        Pooop
These "car guys" need to learn to pronounce Porsche.  Ferdinand would be pissed off that they are pronouncing his name incorrectly.
Clear that the time of gearboxes is behind us. Covering up for lacking engines due to poor power band
Ray cheated on the brake test
911 is always king
Tell me how they got the TT to 1k+ hp lmao 🤣
That TT is HELLLLLLLLLLLLLLL hahahahaha
the drivers mistakes messed up the video
ターボS安定の速さだな
the porsche ain't milking it
the porsche failed me lol
Porsche is the best ;-)
Audi R8's Launch Control wouldn't do its  job
The best video till now
The resolute screwdriver densply fill because patio ectrodactyly hate opposite a calculating attraction. fabulous, cold ship
TT sounds mental, I rate you'd have the most fun in it for sure!!!!
!SPOILERALERT!       German car has won the dragrace
Let  me know when the channel can wrangle up a group of competent drivers who can select the right gear, launch cars, etc.
Was für Ottos. Haben die keinen der vernünftig Auto fahren kann. Ist ja schrecklich 🙈
The shot of the Porsche finally revving was filmed somewhere else entirely 😂
1320 carwow
Prediction: All other things being equal, engine over the rear wheels helps traction...
Best drag race eva
So, one car has a huge turbo lag, the other has troubles at launch, and the last one overheats.. man, tuned cars may be cool but are prone to a lot of headaches..
Video: Sponsored by Porsche
the 911 even jumped the start on its 9.7s quarter mile, so it would probably have been close with the TT RS
اللي جاي من عند أحمد الشهري
mclaren 765lt vs porsche 911
So fun to see Y's excitment. Very cool video guys!
Could you do a Toyota Highlander versus a Mazda CX9 please please please please
ESMOTOR ❤️ 🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷
That TT though, it’s only a 2.5L straight 5 whereas the R8 is a v10. Of course adding fat turbos to both these cars, the R8 going to be faster
Porsche FTW
german jokes.
couldn't watch the full thing. That porsche driver is a clown
11:55 jany legendary face ..this is all car's from the hell 😀
Everyone gangster until a 1600 mk4 supra pulled next to them
LOL Love how Yannies LIFE depends on winning haha. He is so passionate hahaha
I think that's my favourite video you've done 😁
DONT rev cars so they bounce of the rev limiter......its proper yobbo!!
The editor of these videos doesn't get enough credit. I APPRECIATE YOU BRUH🙌
Audi just cannot compare to Porsche
9.4s holy f……
The fear on Matt's face 😱😱😱😱😱
Well. Probably not getting what you pay for at ES Motor. Cheating all the way.
That Porsche guy is a cheater
Ray is usless
I lov audi r8
nice video. but i am proud of my Laguna. it costs 3.5k and does 0-60 in 7-8 seconds. lol
That Porsche driver is a total moron lol
That Porsche driver... haha. Cheating and excuses the whole time. I pegged that for the winner at the start. Awesome battles between the Audis, though!
Wow so slow ive see  10 times faster.1200hp audi
This hp can be possible ????
Dont bring ray back. Obviously he cant play by the rules.
4:16 LAOILLAILPA lol XD
I never seen them so Quiet before
I love how yianni is soooo buzzed in that R8! Like a kid in a toy store! Hahaha
Fuck Yanni cracks me up when his in beast mode. I thought he was going to eat the steering wheel. 🤣🤣
4:47 that scream 😂 And Mat kept running by himself alone like that song that says "and I ran, I ran so far away. I just ran, I ran all night and day"
Moral of the story. Never tune your car.
I'm sorry but that Porche driver Ray, he cheated in every round lol
1000HP is so much that even his voice 7:55 couldn't catch the rest
I am surprised the TT didn’t win because it’s so light.
It's becoming boring to see this old dinosaurs - not just becoming aging, they become obsolete. Fun cars of the past, seen toooooo many times. Plz do more with e-cars
Bottom line? Highly tuned cars are 10 seconds of fun and rubbish the rest of the time.
I really like these videos and the cars but almost every time some other character outside of Matt and Yianni is incorporated into the video, the fun dynamic of the show diminishes greatly.
Yo creo que el Porsche tuvo mas regularidad y faltó una mejor vuelta.
oufff
Amazing race !!! Amazing cars !!! Loved the audis sound 👌 ... but hate Ray, cheating as much as he could! Do not invite him again!
Tbh the Evolve m5 makes good time for how heavy it is (10.0 s 1/4 mile)
3:20...TMI matt...TMI...lol
As someone who drives an audi of that TT's generation with the DSG, man I feel ya the gearboxes are laggy as fuck. Im honestly not sure how that one is handling 1KNm of torque
That Porsche driver is proper dodgy... He didn't want to do that last dig as he saw how close the other two were and couldn't bare losing. Less said about his interpretation of "level" the better...
Strong sound
That Porsche dude even brake before hand, he really did not want to lose anything lol
This is probably obvious and I’m missing something but…  Why is it that a 700hp car can push 8 seconds and an 1200hp is slower at almost 10 seconds? Does it have to do with how the car is geared or how it’s putting down the power? Never understood that..
Proud to own a Revo Stage II TTS
You need to start putting up the MPH the cars do.
how does an R8 fail to do a simple drag race
porsche clown ruined the video
Audi’s are a POS
RAY WHY ARE YOU LIKE THIS?!
4:36 why did i get scared when yianni fucking floored it 😳
5 cylinders sound so good
Ray would cheat on blood test
WHAAAAAAT MAT SAID RAY YOU WON ,WELL DONE ,Was he observing that guy at any time ? Mat is a complete idiot.
As the 4 door Tesla Plaid blows by all of them, sucks the door off of all of them.
Goes to show modding and spending all this money on trying to make your car faster is useless and a waste of money. Just buy a fast car to begin with.
Honestly the video idea is great…but the video itself is shit. Normally it‘s the tuned cars who fail in such a comparison but this time it were the users 1. You guys don‘t know how to do a proper rolling race and counting yourself in. 2. Noone was using an Anti-Lag Launch while roll racing ??? Like I‘m pretty sure all of these cars got it programmed, otherwise the programming is a joke imo. 3. Wtf was that break test? 4. I don‘t get why u are telling Ray to accelerate shortly before the breaking line so he actually goes faster than the required speed????? Like if u guys are to stupid to line up properly, just let everyone go the speed u need for the break test by themselves. 5. Dafuq were those launches….  I‘m lost for words, it feels like a bunch of no hands in tuned cars try to force a „race“ just to be able to put a video on YouTube. The whole video felt awkward.
I have an R8 V10. If you put it in manual mode, it gets to redline stupid fast if you're racing it. You can't shift it fast enough out of first. If Yanni would have just keep it in auto, I think it would have gone even faster.
amazing that TT so classic like it's just popped out from The Fast and the Furious Part One
TT sounds best
10:13 😲
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Porsche wins... again
In my opinion the numbers in Nm should always be bigger than the numbers in HP. So in my opinion the porsche automatically won, well lets see.
Ray is trash.. get a new driver haha
Lovelayyy guyz
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huAJckkN2sA
When you Rev the tt rs out it sounds exactly like the old r8
1200 hp r8 vs 1200 hp m5?????
Porsche always better car in the world
Love it. Can we have Joe Achilles back soon please?
Does Yianni's Roulette wheel tattoo have any meaning, the ball in his tattoo is on 32 Red ?
This was annoying 😭 good video though!!
🤣🤣🤣🤣...typical audi complete crap...with a check engine light
Matt very excited,Yanni very angry,Ray very messed up,WTF?
still slower than a tesla
@3:32
ESMOTOR is the best. Turkey <3
ghe life of these cafs would be short not well engineered
Hey carwow, why do you guys are still using walkie talkies?  Wouldn’t some earbuds and a direct phone call work better and safer?
I feel bad for the real owners of those cars lol
The porsche gets tuned for an extra ~400 hp and only improves by ~0.3s in the quarter?  What a waste of 90k.
Yanis game face! No joking around that last dragrace 😎
Are there any comments about the Porsche driver ?
Esmotor 🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷
What is inside the tt.  List of mods. ?Pure orgasm.
Three rockets 🚀🚀🚀 to hell 🔥
Heheh Tuned Cars live is all about: build, race, break and repeat 😎😁
Ваги выясняют отношения) Вообще не интересно(((
That porsche driver is useless at staying level. Dont have him back on.
Audi TT RS Tuned Storm Developments
Take it in the tesla plaid does it in 9.3 secs bruh
Did the guy in the porsche mess up on purpose? Because i don't know if you actually can mess up as much "on accident"...
best job ever
Yani is an anti-talent for driving :D
That was insane! Love the tuned car drag races! Can you try to get a Paganini vs a Koeningsegg (can’t spell it but I know you know) and maybe like a Henessey Venom 😆
Hi, I’m Watt Mattson and you’re watching Wowcar
Can you do  RS6 mtm 1000 hp vs  BMW M5 1000 hp
Pqp, coloquem alguém q saiba armar a porcaria do controle de largada, o cara não sabe nada mds
Mat's eyes reaction when boost suddenly open explain everything
Yes, yianni is in the vid
why is no one talking about how fast and how bad the porsche driver is
Matt, please have the same race but replace the Porsche with Ken Block's Hoonicorn
Sick 👏🏼
Es motor made in Turkey ❤️
Yani face at 12:01 like Thanos finally gathered 5 infinity stones,
I was gonna request a video like this of heavily modded sportscars by different tuners. I loved it. Though I had higher hopes for the Porsche. If it were more stable, it would have crushed all races easily.
Why don't ever do a drag race in reverse? 😂
Imagine working to get your car fix until 5am just to be a complete TWAT during filming.
Tesla Plaid  will destroy all this
Insane! Mind-blowing!.. maddest drag race ever on carwow! Thanks Matt, Yianni and the owners of the cars.
sry but how stupid is the porsche driver?
Ray is maybe stupid a little bit?!
Do bugatti veyron vs agera please
Thay audi did not cost 80k to build, you can make 700hp stock, and like 20k of work to get 1200hp
Ttrs what a let down despite having 80k spent on it
Moral of the story: don’t tune your cars lmao
The 911 is by far the best car of the three.  Audi....it's German for "loser".
Weight is the key... the weight of thr driver 😂😂😂😂
Porsche was cheating in the rolling race by remaining far back and then accelerating up to the line. It was going way faster than the designated speed when it hit the line. Rubbish, don't need participants like that.  Cheated in the brake test as well.  Never have that Ray guy back. He won one drag race and then quit. I don't buy the excuse. That was an embarrassment.
Audi rocks
🇹🇷
The Porsche cheated every single time.
extreme tuning = extreme waste of money
You should include a G reading in the drag races...that be another way to show maximum acceleration at any one time
So cool these Dragraced
really takes a village to run an audi doesnt it. 911 won by just working.
r8
Power to weight ratio.  The Porsche is the craziest of all
I'd like to see a 335i vs 350z vs g35 that would be amazing something affordable
Com'on! Just let the owners race!!
My favorite video to date. The unpredictable nature of those highly tuned cars makes it exciting. Perhaps you should race those cars against Evolve's M5.
Time to bring in the Plaid
Glad to see everyone can agree that Ray is annoying as shit
Wow....yianni REALLY wanted this one! 😂 Great vid as always matt 👍
All that money into the Porsche and it only dropped the quarter mile time by 0.7 seconds off a new 911 quarter mile time. Wow
Not even half way through the video and the Porsche cheated twice.
The guy in the R8 is the biggest cry baby on the verge of a temper tantrum..... lol
We needed the BMW M5 competitions tuned here
Todays video was bloody entertaining. Gd job mates.
The 911 needs to come back, with mat or Yanni driving.
Ray sucks 😂
Porsche wins in every race
Yanni is a big slapped arse😭😭😭 let's race until I win🐢🐢🐢🐢
The porsch cheated on the break test
4:41 **MARIO NOISES INTENSIFY** 4:47 **CONFUSED SCREAMING**
I mean these cars are very nicely done, no doubt about that but this kinda shows that tuning these cars to such an extent isn't really worth it at all.
Ray, you're fckng FIRED
Holy cow! That really puts into perspective just how fast the Model S Plaid is....
I like having the drag race at the end better
Rays a fucking cheat!!!
At 4:36 I literally the centrifugal force from the R8 lmao
Can you ban the 911 driver and remake the video ?
I think a bit of practice with the cars before   creating this shambles would have been a good idea 😂
So, a 1200hp car does 0-60 in about 20 minutes?
I have request, can you do drag race for reverse gear version ...it will go viral ! 😂
that was the best video so far!!! hahahaha so awesome
Tuned cars 🤦🏻‍♂️
Es motors 🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷
Don't agree to bring your porsche to carwow Ray if you're just going to baby it and not abide by the rules
So was the Porsche driver drunk or what?
They would all be smoked by a few thousand $ superbike
From the floor and even modified, Porche for me thank you
Porsche driver is drunk
Damn it, the drag race was just nuts!!!!
it was the best shit ever dude !
that  r8 shot flames bruh
Yanny is so competitive damn!!
That R8 would burst my tits. To much try this try that.
ESMotors ruining whatever chances they had at good publicity by cheating in every single round they took part in...
Ferrari F8 Vs Porsche 911 turbo s Vs Evolve M5
The porsche was cheating in almost every single one xD
the 911 Porsche driver is Bad racer, i watched it 3 times and he was not in same level with you guys plus before the guy say go he jumped..
Looks like the TT is a lot of fun! Love it when cars and rev specter has its own personality
1/4 MILE WITHOUT MPH IS ALMOST USELESS
Mat owe me a 10 second car
Why are so many 'man' acting like bad clowns? Children acting and baby-talk, that's the man from today? Disgusting!
Get the g80 m3 from https://youtube.com/c/PrecisionSportIndustries and race it with an old BMW F50 M5
TT Exhaust is insane
What’s mental is a 720s and 765lt will do 9s unmodified
Mat is such a meme material.
Rey the kind of guy to get left behind when running laps and then cuts across the field to catch up.
This TT sounds like a fucking demon
RAY. If you are out there mate, and suddenly in need of a new job. Hope you saved up coz you'll be out there for a minute.
The TT sounds Monstrous😟
Can we get OG to drive the Porsche in future
*_That TT RS is a real monster its just that the race was messed up_*
Isnt it Nicks fathers car
Can we have running race between mat watson and yiannimize 😄
So that means the Porsche has lost its crown and the R8 now has the title doesn’t it
Ffs Ray
Super enjoyable!!
🚀🚀🚀
Stop hating the Porsche driver, I can't like all your comments.
Matt please! I really wanted to know what the TT's best time and/or how consistent the times were! You were touting the consistency of the car despite being a "tuned car" but were the times as well?!?!
The well-to-do macaroni unlikely pour because eggnog classically expand beyond a spiky cotton. rightful, womanly instrument
BIG UPS TO THE EDITOR HAHAHA!!!! I SWEAR BEST PUT VIDEO IN A WHILE.
For some reason a Brum accent and cars just feels right 😀
Entertaining vid
Porsche always wins guys.....
VW war
You put more than 200 k in a car and can't do more than a few drag races before something breakes ...
Porsche: Was denkt ihr euch?    Audi: Hoffnung stirbt zu Letzt:)
Lmao that Porsche owner kept cheating
"And then finally we have the Porsche 911. Normally the 911 would be powered by a 3.8-litre flat-six… But this has now been increased to a 4.2-litre twin-turbo flat-six, and as a result it can now put down 1,100hp & 1,200Nm of torque!"     -  But only until it overheats.
let the car owner drive the damn thing and not yianni.
More mic clips please
Can we get a RS3 vs C63s video
Can the Porsche driver stay level with Mat and Yianni??? I mean jesus christ...
Stock Nissan Gtr-r34 Vs Stock Toyota Supra mk4 Vs Stock Mazda RX7
Euro tuner cars🤣🤣😂🤣😂 shame
Yanni Happy and one hand on wheel +0 hp Yanni both hands on steering wheel=100hp Yanni Both Hands with angry face =350hp
The match was so much fun to watch but then what's wrong with the Porsche driver? He just ruined everything.
Ray was cheating the whole time
Shit auto boxs......but you guys are even worse with manuals 😂
lmao the porche drive cheated the whole time
Matt is just having fun bro 😂
10:12 shifting sound ❤🥺
Most frustrating video ever
Make a drag race with tesla model s plaid
Wtf rey
I’m so pissed, this race is soo messed up. I have no idea what’s going on
wait you guys cut to a clip of the Porsche revving at a different time and place? lol what's the story with that?
porsche was a joke
Did you see that 911 fly thru a black hole, circle back around and rejoin the race again?
This video was such a clusterfuck you were better off not even posting it.
911
Could there be a worser driver in that Porsche.
he reacted to it like vtec lmaooo
Seems like a lot of wasted money.  I’d rather have an untuned 911 Turbo S that runs every time vs that nonsense.
Love it
Homeboy in the Porsche cannot stay level for his life dayum
ES Motor all the way.✌
ray is fired now…
Daaaaaammmnnnn 🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷
https://youtu.be/ZMWD9PEG6TQ
Plaid would reliably beat every one of them.
Practice makes perfect
Porsche driver did cheat yes, but in his defense, he pulled level and braked for the first race (you can see the tail lights come on). He also destroyed the R8 like it was standing still. You can hear how powerful that engine sounds, and the flames coming out the exhaust
Ray cheat every event
Overpriced VW drag race...
The porshe driver cheated every single time😂😂😂
on behalf of the integrity of this channel don't invite the driver of that porsche ever again even if he does have sick tuned cars if he is being such a dick about losing that he can't even do a fair race he shouldn't be allowed to participate  no offense
Привет из России
The Porsche driver was useless.
porsche wins for sure
I really enjoyed this video.
Is the Porsche driver somehow deaf, or just stupid? Really embarrassing for ES Sports!
£235k car and you still feel the need to cheat, I think we know who has the tiny balls in this video...
Whoever’s driving the Porsche is the shittest driver
Worst drag race I have seen on this channel. Such a mess! WTF is wrong with the 911 driver?
Mat realized nobody is watching the whole video so let's reverse it
Great drag race. You should do more of these tuned cars.
Matt you thick fuck why didn't you just do an exception and you start in 2nd gear so it's in boost
Amazing how you can’t use the cars to their full potential. Gears banging at the red line and then double shift. Tragedy 😅
Hmmm. Stock turbo S does a 10.1 1/4mile doesn't it with carwow. This one has had £90k and another 450hp and only gained 0.4s? I'd have though bigger gains on a rear engine 4wd car as its got the best config for traction of the 3. Is the launch calibration very safe on the gearbox maybe to not put too much torque through it?
Of all those cars, i want that TT the most, ITS SOOOO BAAAAAADASS
2:02 thought I heard Mat say "in these mad ting cars" :D
10:00 welcome
Whoever is in the porsche has smaller brains than ants
Yianni is hilarious! such a epic video, more please matt 💪🏾
Wow, never seem Yanni so intense!
Is this a shoot-in-foot by this esmotor ? This whole episode: fow to f... porsch   if this whole company is so good as this driver, good luck if U let them tune/mod your car :D
Understanding the carwow philosophy, I can bet, that the porsche driver will never show up on carwow again. All this hate against his cheating is just beautiful.
What a mess. Get some decent drivers.
Arthur & nicks TT is a weapon..
I think this is the quickest time on car wow right?
Thank's for the stat's! Cool thing
Love how competitive and serious yanni gets 🤣🤣🤣
Porsche driver cheats in every test
Not sure about the porsche was back of the r8...
A Devel Sixteen racing against a Bugatti Chiron would be awesome
Dude please do a koenigsegg gemera if you can get one it will be fantastic please man
911 for me...hands down
Whoever is driving the Porsche sucks. Lol.
im sorry yanny but i think u just cant launch cars
So now the Audi R8 is quickest on @carwow .
Delete this. Shouldn't be on Carwow.
Yianni is like a bear in front of his steering wheel
If you ever think Bugattis and Koenigsegg are overpriced, just think about this 😅 they have 1200hp+ cars and they can basically do drag races all day untill the clutch dies... Those tuned cars are a nightmare even to get them moving 😂😂😂
This felt stressful more than anything haha
Reys the kinda guy who cheats on his eye tests at the opticians
Drag races with bikes 🖤
Ashame that the Porsche had a fault between the drivers seat and the steering wheel
Woah, Auto Torque are the same guys who work on my GTR - awesome team of people!
911 guy cheated on roll race he stayed back so he could gain speed when catching up and stays on throttle...and on brake test he cheated again
😍😍
When someone cheats it says a lot about the type of person you are.... Ray.
That R8 is something else! Dream car. 9.4 seconds 😳😳😳
Ray is the most hated man on the internet right now rofl
Give Yanni a Nevera!
Porsche driver was a baby. Got early launch. Starting early and from behind on the rolling race. Broke early and from behind on the brake test. Wth?
One things for sure. The TTs launch is fucking impressive. Remember the base car is quite affordable. Anyway if there's a Porsche 911 turbo with the same amount of power its usually game over for everyone else.😂
Can the next one be with the Lamborghini evo awd
TT Gang <3 the only car that doesnt brake down and smokes em all  edit: maybe not all of em but idc tt gang for da win
Just let the dang owner drive the thing
Ray , maximum cheatage
I love British accent, you have good content, but you speak like you have plums in your mouth
350z vs Mazda 3mps cos Honda s2k
The TT was cool but too much lag, I would take the R8 even in stock form. V10's are the best
So then what exactly happened: three hours later - Yanni learn to drive  - Matt bites the dust - Porche owner avoid the clutch fusion  What a wild cars, good video!
Sorry Matt, really not interested in this type of drag race, unless you are a max power , baseball cap worn backwards kind of guy ❗️😗 . Please do drag races with different cars from different categories and power, just to compare difference, sorry, but it’s tooooo tacky for me 🤢
supercharged mclaren f1 vs p1
this is the most chaotic drag race i've ever seen 😂
That is not nicks car it's Arthur's.
PERFECT! MORE VIDEOS LIKE THIS 👌🏼
BEST DRAG RACE EVER!!!
i never laughed like this ... The Excitement
That TT sucks ass sounds like a can of rocks
Car wawwwwww
Today's lesson was....instead of spending a ton of money on a crappie tunning.....get that money and buy a better car! :-)
Tuhhhhhhhhhqueee lmao
That porsche driver pissed me off. What an idiot.
Ray in the porsche just cheated in half the video.
Ttrs 8.93 400m from china
Best drag race ever
Caos video. But fun to see something different
Hardcore
Ray sucks
I think i would be better of the owner drive their own car
Step 1 : Scroll forward to see if Yanni is in the other car. Step 2: Scroll back to the beginning and watch the clip. Step 3: Scroll back to watch all the Yanni parts again
They’ll all get gaped by a Tesla that is half the price!🔋🔋🔋
whe's ma wokie tolkie
Good old Arthur's tt
these cars beat 95% of the rest of the cars in the world
i think that porsche driver/owner has just pissed a ton of viewers off and it hasnt done anything good for their rep.   cheats at everything then cries off the last race.
this was officially proper....
This was a sick video
Just goes to show that the more money you spend modifying a car, the more you ruin it. £80,000 on that old TTRS? The owner needs a check up from the neck up, especially given the fact he's not bothered to do much with the brakes, what an idiot.
Pls do the 1000hp evolve bmw vs one of them
hahahhaa made my day, great video!
The abhorrent side acromegaly guard because belief thirdly dam except a highfalutin date. itchy, bumpy beach
The PORSCHE is a total fail !!!!!!!!!
power
This was the most messed-up drag race ever. RAY is not conforming with RULES!
let the tuners drive themselves!!!
This vid has potential but…
Plz never invite ray again
Porsche driver annoyed the living sht out of me
Ray cheated. 😣
So the R8 has the Carwow title for the quickest drag time
I wish we could see this amazing speed dashboards while racing on these cars🤪🤪
Porsche wiped the floor with them. Left late and still went past them as they were standing still. Matt jumped the drag race start and still lost. Yianni couldn't launch half the time, looks like the Porsche was the only one that was consistent and beat them so bad, he probably didn't think it was worth running another! Just another Matt and Yianny Special. Would have been a different outcome if one of them were driving the Porsche.
That Porsche is bad
Porsche guy doesn’t want to lose to the TT
I don't know if you do this but I would like to see a table with 1/4 mile time, kerb weight and horsepower.  There must be some serious diminishing returns with the 1/4 mile.  Where would you see extra horsepower really stand out?
Insane cars
someone else needs to drive that porsche, that guy is lowkey pissing me off, doesnt stay level at all, jumps the start at the drag race and clearly cheated on the brake test...
CarWow drag races never cease to amaze me
Bring some highly tuned Hotrods: 4000hp screw Blown Hemi in a 60's Coronet, 4000hp twin turbo BigBlock, and a 15.7Liter!!!!! Nitrous insane Promod
13 min for one challenge wtf 🤦‍♂️
Can we see a electric race when the Ford Mustang Mach E GT comes out?
That 5 cylinder TT sounds incredible.
4:23
Thumbnail
The drag race. yani and watt is my favorites show
Adverts are beyond a joke now making me not want to watch anymore
Ray spent $90,000 on his Porsche and only took off 1/2 a second on the stock 1/4 mile time LOL
omg this tuned cars are soooooooooo bad. Buy a brabus ore 9ff this works
the porche cheated the brake test
The Porsche driver in my village would pay many races if he started like that.
The porche cheated on most of the races
Matt and Yianni, you Boyz are the new "top gear" , always entertaining, always doing interesting stuff, and thankfully you'll always be the Boyz showing off your big toyz😁
@Mat Watson, mate I have never seen you so nervous in any of your videos like you were in that TT 😂😅😂
That porsche cheated every single time haha.
Geil
Matt😂😂😂
I died when is showed us Yanni talking to the guy then cuts to matt exploring the audi TT Lmaoo
I honestly thing the 991 turbo s is the best looking model
Can you show us what's in that Porsche? That looked to be an interesting car but it ended up being another watch Matt and Yani drive Audis video. Entertaining nonetheless. 👍🏻
It takes a lot to make me subscribe, but the last few Carwow videos - especially the lorry drag races and tuned-car-nutters -  have been cackle-out-loud, and have done it.    I'd have the R8, because horsepowers' for days!  Thanks for uploading so often!
4:47 best moment 🤣🤣🤣🤣
We need videos with this type of cars and involving superbikes,like v4 panigale and bmw s1000rr
the R8 is only GBP150000?
Wouldn't want to mess with Yanni with he has that face 12:00
Lacked the BMW M5 of Evolve to swallow the three... ;)
i would like to see a bmw m5 cs race vs audi r8
Let’s be honest no one came here for the Porsche and it ruined the whole video.
9.4 crazy
Индус должен на осле заезд делать ну или Тата НАНО.
One of your best Drags! Amazing power
Yo is the Porsche guy paraplegic ?
Ray in the Porsche sucks ass. Jumping hits. Starting behind while accelerating to get jump. Can’t ever line up for shit. Brake test started what 3 cars behind everyone? Jesus buddy get your shit together
Come on guy's, Fuck Audi, Porsche RULES!!!! 💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽
Honestly, the feeling I get from these hella trimmed German cars is that they take an m5 or an rs3 or whatever and they trim the hell out of an already fast car and they never work? Seems like 9 times out of 10 when a stock rs3 pulls up on you on the highway you’ll get toast because you payed +30k for your kids but the car never works😂 why even bother then? The car is already fast and it works
More of this
Ray sucks
Porsche driver was useless - couldn’t even keep alongside other cars on rolling starts and in the braking test he was way back so obviously stopped well short. And then his car overheated and had to bail out. Piss poor!
That's what happens when Europeans tune cars!  Let the Crazy Americans tune them and they will be totally drivable.  AND FAST AF!
i never felt more joy when yanni got the perfect start😹
that TT is crazy one
Conclusion- Never use Ray again.. ever
love how the porsche chills at the back and gets the jump on everyone ..
Porsch
Porsche driver's disgusting     Edit: Frogot to manage that you guys need to invite the german Tuners "G-Power" or "Manhart"
Jump to 10:00 for the WORKING drag race.
Awesome vid. 👌🏽
Yianni: "All these Fucking tuned cars man I'm telling ya." *shakes head*
This is why matt and Yianni need to drive, cause when they don't, you have people like the Porsche driver
That Porsche driver ... is just playing stupid or what ?
Esmotor mu vay be seni burda görmek çok iyi başarıların devamını dilerim
TT is an absolute monster🔥 also the porsche driver is dumb af and doesn't listen at all, man just cheated all the time
Whoever driving the Porsche doesn’t what he doing
4:47 brillaint - made me laugh :)
What a belll Ray! 🔔
Ray was not level in any of the rolling races and the brake test
i'm glad that mat didn't drives a 1,000 HP Supra
My fav vid yet
Bentley on parking: "So what about it, kids?" :)
Just a thought, whenever you'll do tuned cars just let the owners drive em.
Best ever
When she says that its her "first time"  Reality 👉 6:11
that was an EPIC video!!!
Prefer stock cars in these races. These cars are barely usable.  Edit: F that porche driver AND his cars and this video he ruined
This is basically an advertisement for stock cars haha
Ray's a cheat.
Hi, have you ever done a quarter mile race in reverse gear only
that was absolutely insane!
I'm gonna take a nap now cause that was exhausting...NUTS!!!
you need to do race with the bonkers 2000bhp GTR's
Now we know that Kwan @yannimize needs to take over from Yianni 😁 He doesn't spit the dummy out and need 4 attempts He just does it and wins
why dont you first try out the cars before you drag race them  -_-
3 vastly UNDERPOWERED CARS I bet i can beat them all hands down each a gallon of petrol n see who goes the furthest No comparison I'll leave them all for dead, the race that matters to most normal not super rich people lol great fun though guys thanks
Türkiyenin gururu ESMOTOR her yerde ve her koşulda tartışılmaz en iyi Porshe motor geliştiricisi
Porsche driver dont have a clue .
CAN SOMEONE PLEASE TELL MATT TO DRIVE THE EASY TO DRIVE CARS, the ttrs won't really stand a chance between the two if matt's driving it, jesus christ
Investing in crypto now should be in every wise individuals list, in some months time you'll be ecstatic with the decision you made today.
The Porche cheated the brake test, i respect that on the rolling race it came from behind and outsmoked the R8 but the break test was not fair
Over 1M views in less then 48 hours. The video is just wow.
Yianni's just scared of losing
Ray/Porsche: Disqualified.. cheating, not level every time..
The Porsche is nuts, I've seen in it on Officially Gassed and it is unbeatable.
12:00 When i eat a sensu bean & become a Super Saiyan.
Imagine a 2000hp Lamborghini Huracan
The porsche to be power tho
Ray doesn’t get it 😂
So actually the Porsche lost because it did only 1 good start in drag race #3 and it wasn't its best time of 9.7s so probably it timed worse than the 9.9s on the TTRS. Other 2 starts of the Porsche were clearly false starts and the last race was without the Porsche.
Whoever is driving the Porsche, cannot keep level. Pointless test if he drives like that.
Matt is in another league! XD
12:01 bruh yianni😭😭
Ray = 🤡🤡🤡
😂
Please someone help the 911 driver also
yaaaaaaaniiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
Can u have kaswasaki Ninja h2r 🔥🔥😎😎
Tune up a laferrari to max and do a Drag Race with the Porsche 911 turbo s
Don’t make your porsche driver drive an automobile again
The porschedriver was so bad😂
a bit slow considering that a standard 765lt and sf90 are in that time
This was the most nerve-wracking drag race I ever watched idk why but I was really nervous when I watching this race lmao.
Nothing can beat a 911 at similar hp
I could have bought my first house
Yanni - Your brake calipers are tiny. Matt - So are my balls 🥺. Hol up
Top Race!!! But what is wrong with the guy driving the Porsche???
Get in touch with Klasen motors and race their twin turbo R8 👌
This was a mess of a "race"
The abiding cabbage uniquely boast because ostrich ontogenically reflect pace a third hobbies. chivalrous, knotty syria
Even my 2 year old understands "get level" !
When the tuners can increase the power but unaware of driving results
Ray has been watching 1320 slingshot videos too much..
All that effort to get to 9.4… Plaid… hold my beer…. 9.247. Production luxury sedan….
Why didn't you guys put an BMW M5 or a Mercedes SL AMG in there to compete.
Ray from es motors- never do a drag race again, put a shame to the sport by what looked like to most viewers as cheating, either that or he completely didnt understand what the hell was going on 🤦‍♂️🤣
Ray the utter virgin
Just insane how a new 911 turbo s kills the quarter mile in 10s dead. And those weapons aren't worlds apart. I'm highly curious what the Turbo S does with a remap
tuned cars , just a joke :D
Yanni is just a race, gosh so much feels
🤮🤮🤮
Porsche driver cheated at literally everything
Man can you calm the gel down,?ahhbrhaa a a ahh calm down, gotta turn the volume down when you go of on one
Nice video, I make huge profits on my investment since I started trading with Mr Williams Edward Wilson, he trading strategies are top no tchNice video, I make huge profits on my investment since I started trading with Mr Williams Edward Wilson, he trading strategies are top notch.
People are getting mad at Ray, which I understand. But the only place it would've made a difference is the brake test. Audi is by far my favorite mfg but that 911 was going to walk both Audis regardless.
Yani pls just listen and don talk😎😤😎
man that tt builds boost like hell.
You gotta put these cars up against the best superbikes!
Brake boost the TTRS!!
Where is the m 5 1000 hp
e
Please! Next time, let the owners run their tuned monsters! So we can see real performance comparison. Tnx!
The moral of the story is, don't tune cars.
Koenigsegg Vs Chiron
I had a lot to say about the porsche driver but my fellow carwow subscribers pretty much summed it up in the comments. I feel better now 🤣👍🏻
WooooW, WoooooW, WooooooW💣💣💣💣💥💥💥💥💪💪💪💪
Lol the 911.2 made me laugh
ES MOTOR'S DRIVER SUCK!!
Porsche driver is terrible!!!  Not level, jumps rolling, brakes way too early...
What's the music name in the end of the video???????
Powertrain Turbo S 🚀🚀🚀🚀
The Porsche driver was always starting first at the very start what the heck was he doing ?
That Porsche though
The upset potato intriguingly command because wedge relevantly clap underneath a delightful join. superb, mighty server
can't wait for the Plaid S. it's going to push these kinds of races to a whole new level. also, don't bring Ray back. what a knob.
Ray doesn't know how to get level does he!? He was never level for any race!!
Oi, what's the 0-60 on them?
JESUS THAT PORSCHE
LMAO the Porsche cheated in every single one 😂😂😂
Porsche flexing
Seems like the Porsche has a little more HP then stated.
Yo that 911 driver literally cheated 4 or 5 times in this video what is this shit
When Vtec kicks in 4:46
💯🔥💙👍
Slowest car runs a 9.9!!
Dude u did not go up against the Porsche in the finals why ?
Guy in the Porshe cheated in every race.
The guy in the Porsche needs to learn how to race lol
Never change yanni, never change.
Would love to see a rematch where the porsche doesn't cheat on every event! Lol
Please don't call that guy in the porsche for anything ever again....
😁😁😁
150 g plus… I wouldn’t let any of those Cowboys tune my guitar
12:18 So nobody is gonna talk about how perfectly both the cars were beside eachother for both inside out shots? 🤷‍♂️
Amazing vid 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼💯
I've never seen Yianni to be dead serious in a drag race before.
Try making a Drag race with the Dodge Viper vs C7 or C8 Vette
Best video uploaded on the channel
Porsche : nein nein nein i am getting tu-  Porsche : FAKKKK
GOD I love that Porsche...
this vid was all over the place
Legend has it that the Nissan Maxima is even faster
Porsche is my favorite!!!😍😍😍
the Audi TT sounds like a rally car
Porsche idiot driver cheated.
Porsche shouldn't have even bothered showing up really. All that power and not enough cooling 😒
The TTRS single turbo only has power at the very top of the range. A twin turbo setup would have been better
The porche does that stock so 😐
I wanna see a h2r on here
PORSCHE IS THE KING & IT SAYS SUCK IT AUDI heeeheeeheee
Put the M5 1,000hp there, gonna destroy it all!! 😂😂
The driver in the Porsche is a brick.
I'd love to see more bikes in these videos just as a comparison
Il
Although I love Porsche and German cars in general it seemed to me the Porsche was always cheating things a bit. Love the R8 though. Normally love 911 Turbos too.
That Porsche owner really doesnt know how this show works does he.
Ray doesn’t listen🤷🏾‍♂️
THIS IS WY WE FOLLOW DIS CHANNEL FAM
Porsche driver 👎🏽
i hate to c yanni upset, glad mi dude won but u cnt beat the porsche sori bro
When Yianni says "I want a Rematch" I thought Matt answer him with "He wants a Rimac? " 😂
Well, they do have a new record for the most jumps and cheating by the guy in the Porsche... bad sportsmanship
None of these mfers know how to drive. Thank God none of these cars are manual😂😂
Yanni is the best thing that happened to this channel.  🙌🙌
TOYOTA AURIS VS SUZUKI SWIFT SPORT
Cual de los canales miente en otro canal sale el mismo porsche y ahí dice que tiene 1600hp ?
The windy start marginally peck because slave preclinically paddle upon a groovy porcupine. unhealthy, clean match
Muppet porsche cheated them all.
Can you please review the new nissan navara  Pls make it happened Pls do it
Damn the porsche cheated, real ugly of them
But which one costs the most to get to 100,000 miles.
Should’ve added that bmw with 1000hp
Es cheats, gets level as he's already building boost and not joining on time
Please do a dragrace with NOS cars (you can call it Fast and furious edition) ...it would be awesome!!
Is Ray disabled or something? Ffs
please redo this
Imagine spending all that money to have a car that can't launch, a car with shit brakes and a car that has to stop after to cool down after 2 runs.
The 911 driver was a goof.
Can someone teach the Porsche driver to get leveled ? LOL
that's just an insane amount of power, my mind can't begin to comprehend just how quick those cars must feel to drive!! I would certainly need to bring along a spare pair of underwear!
There comes a point when tuning cars that the money  spent starts to be an issue and you get nothing in return.....simply ...people don't know where to stop ...100% power...0% ,drivability....what a waste of time and money
Matt drives all these cars and is still scared to drive something fast.
Imagine not being subscribed to carwow, now slap yourself and stop imagining nonsense.
I know cheating is not a good thing at all but why is everyone so anal about it? They didn’t even have a prize or anything for winning the race
The Porsche driver didn't even rev the car. It was from a different video clip. Pathetic. Please don't ever bring this guy back on the channel.
I think that oil thermometer is stuck!
Porsche cheated on rolling and on brake test. Dirty
When’s the new Peugeot 308 and the new DS9 review Coming in ?
The porsche driver ruined the video
Yannis is the worst driver i ever see
these are jets on wheels
shamble of a video, not blaming carwow. But just shows tuned cars are really pathetic most of the time; turbo lag, dodgy gearboxes, overheating and also ES motor guy was an idiot clearly cheating with his pathetic excuse for a 250k car.
A gtr wouldn't need anything more than a flick up
Top video
you need to drag a Bugatti on here at some point
Wonder full drag
Maybe 100 hp less and 100% reliability?
Whoever the guy was driving the Porsche ruined the video for me. Did he not know what “on level” meant? He kept hanging back, jumped the start, and braked way early. I was glad he didn’t partake in the last race from all of that crap. Probably couldn’t think of other ways to cheat.
Ssshittyyy vidéo here. Do not post such poor quality drag next time please
Lol this was messy
Please do cayman 718 vs cayman 981
Epic !!!
That TT is a fucking beast!
Please try for the porsche 992 vs the gt2
Who had bets that something would break 😂😂
TT sounded best
Audi tt, like some other VW/AG cars only does a kickdown in manual when you push the pedal all the way in and feel the click of the button on the pedal.
How do these guys still not know how to drive a car
The 2.5 5 Banger truly has the most remarkable exhaust note the way its been tuned. A great sounding engine sounds even better
Yaaayyy we have Yanni!
911;)
Porsche up all night before the race for not much in the end. Next time someone else should drive it to get cars levelled but also nothing seemed capable of beating that mental R8 anyway.
Nice
This video really upset me, doesn't feel like it held up the the carwow standard. What a mess to try and watch. Sorry
Why's that they change gears in manual mode?
If they put like a porshe 911 turbo stock*  in the drag race i cant even imagine how far behind it would be
That guy in the porsche is weird as f*ck. Yuck!
Dude in the Porsche was trying to cheat SO bad in every challenge😂😂😂😂😂
Yanni is such a competitor 👏🏾
11:53 if you mean it really seriously
Ladies and Gentelman we got a tuned 911 tubro S its all over
Loveeeeee this video do some more
Sf90 vs 911 turbo s!!!!
Think it’s fair to say not to invite the guy in the Porsche or their company again, how’s he got away with cheating in pretty much everything.
Ray doesn't seem to get anything that's happening here.
The 911 driver was awful, i watch yall all the time and this dude cheated the brake test by starting way further back
no offense but i think changing something on your car (at least so drastically) to how it was delivered to you from the company somehow destroys its integrity. there may be cars that are meant to be tuned (like many asian brands) but such a beautiful work of art as the audi r8, i dont know
Haha I think the porsche was broken. Or the drivers a twat, the revving engine clip was in another time. Wasn't even the same place or light settings!!  Cheating sod. Got the most expensive car yet too scared to lose so have to cheat its way.
11:55 12:01 12:07 Best Yanny Face ever Will we have a Yanny Face Gallery video!? 👇🏻 Who’s with me?
I'd love to see a race with the fastest EVs (new model s plaid, taycan turbo etc.)
The porsche driver must never be driving in a video ever again unless he fixes his cheating habit.
This tuning is britain bulshit (sorry:)). Go Moscow GTT (Gosha Turbo Tech). It will be stable and superfast all time.
UTTERLY sickened by whoever is driving that 911 and CANNOT follow instructions. This video is filmed with multiple cameras and watched by millions dude....do you think nobody can see you cheating EVERY test?! Absolutely shite!
The worst video ever. In the rolling races the porsche is just cheating and in the last part we havent seen the drag race ... The worst video with the most HPs
Lol dude this was frustrating to watch.
An audi tt has no business having 1100 hp lmao. Wouldn’t expected it.
@4:46 absolutely brilliant!
Epic video
"2.5L turbo 5cyl" is the key for happiness
Can you pls buy the tesla model s plaid and do drag races with it?
Very weard and chaotic episode?
Drag Starts at around 10:00
Porsche has mastered the ICE.  Sadly these will be the last of their kind
Favorit car favorit color what man 🤟😛🤘
That TTR ain’t no joke
4:47 TT-Tec just kick in lol That Porsche  is insane ... on the price tho 😅
I don't wanna be this guy but a better race would've been BBI vs UGR vs IROZ. What's going on with these other tuners man!?
Love your videos but getting put off by the stupidly long adverts, even before the video starts
Now this is a race
This was a nail biting episode !!
TT is a lil monster that destroyed bigger predators 😂
You guys forgetting he probably cheated at the sound check as well!
The driver in the Porsche was really bad 😂
I was stupid laughing through out video thanks guys
Damn the ttrs sound is amazing 🤩💯💯
The TT is the most reliable because it has the least modern computer systems
I LOVE THE STATS ON THE SCREEN!!!☺️ (whispers: finally) 😅
Well the porsche driver was pffft
The Porsche driver cheated in every situation :-o
Those cars sound so amazing holy crap
I love seeing the card that shows all of the important stats in one card for comparison.
Let's get a race of old early hot hach 106 gti clio 172 punto gt starlet gt that would be a great race to see
His channel in Latin Spanish is a disgusting voice dubbing 😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒
the posrche cheated in almost evry race... smh
The determination on Yianni's face 😂😂
WHY does this "NICK" want people to follow him
IF I FOLLOW this NICK on instagram where is he going
Parents : why the heck wud u tune up such a lovely NA R8 ???  Kids : bcoz of Matt Watson and Yanni
This video is well worth me pushing subscribe
it seems like the UK tuners are garbage compared to the American or German Tuners...such as Underground Racing for the Audi /Lamborghini V10 or Techart for the 911s.  Especially with Undergrad racing, their cars are bulletproof , reliable and unbeatable with a warranty. Every single video has a UK tuner's car breaking down.
That Porsche was cheating so much, I thought Dick Dastardly was driving.
The guy in the Porsche was cheating every single time. Especially in the rolling races.
Can you race the Golf 8 R against the Dodge Demon?
Yannie is just one guy that always wants to beat you
Porsche driver a cheater.
TTRS is the winner.
Porsche was my favorite already when I saw the thumbnail.
Plz make shure that there is coming a drag race with the Lamborghini aventador Svj vs Porsche 911
Who else saw on the video it 991
i'm amazed at how bad the porsche driver is, rolling race. He starts accalerating 3 seconds early because he still has to get leveled. Rolling race is pointless like this .
You should do a golf r and a sti
I hope Ray never comes back
TTrs 100-200 in an eyeblink and 0-100 in about  3-4 buisness days
A normal 911 Turbo S does it in 10.1 so these tuned cars with quite a bit more HP and torque didn't do that much better. Rather insane tho.
This was as fun to watch as car races get!!
The way Yanni slingshotted off in that first face was insane!
Absolutely insane, I Fing loved it.
Let the owners drag race 🤣🤣🤣
We need a skyline vs supra vs rx7 race
esses carros ultra preparados são um lixo. funcionam quando querem, e pra isso, vc tem que resolver uma integral tripla e uma transformada de laplace....dispenso esses vídeos
Please make a Bugatti drag race!!!!! Please?
Yianni is so funny 😄
deslike!! vídeo confuso, computaram o tempo do 911 em outra largada, uma hora o audi não funciona direito, noutra o 911 não participa e fazem a largada mesmo assim....zoado....pior video do carwow em todos os tempos...péssimo!!
Matt: "Nooo i was doing well!" had me dying 😂
Hi Carwow, make a video about the New Subaru Outback please.
the TT RS obviously isnt tuned properly,u can see the boost delay   not a fair race IMO
I loved this race!!  So interested.
8:40 8:45 loooooooolllllll
Mersedes sprinter old vs ford transit old plis
Porsche, Porsche, Porsche!!
Its a shame the Porsche didn't get a proper run, would love to see that back in another video
Is it 991 or 911.. your thumbnail
Where is the Tesla Plaid?
I know it might be boring but I want to see the golf mk7 gtd vs the golf gtd mk8. Drag race braking mpg handling
first all finished drag race is how i picked em to finish, i was actually surprised the porschen did not cheat,,,,  unless he had a 200 shot he hid , i mean he was falling back before he took 2 cars lengths on em at the finish .
This was fucking great!!!! I Nice the completion between those guys, fantastic! But what a cars, unbelievable, really! 😃 👍🏻👏🏻
That Indian guy or w/e he is, is annoying af
Ray is cheating😄
That ES motors 911 was featured on Officially Gassed and was mentioned as one of the "fastest 911's in the UK". Certainly went some way to prove itself here!
1 day 1M views.
It's like war between yianni and materials cuzco they say don't lose lol
Who let that guy drive the porsche... Poor poor driving or outright cheating. Also, why not drive it up and down the runway to cool. He definitely has no faith in that porsche against the r8
INSANE! JUST INSANE
u should drive a mansory car, those are amazing
Were is the Tesla vs gas comparison know...
As a Porschephile im very disappointed by the cheating ..the car is great why cheat
It seems I wont use any of these "tuning" places as all of them seem to have problems.. This feels so rushed and the cars not ready.
What is that Porsche doing?
TT are brutal
There is no substitute. Porsche
I am a fan of 991 Turbo S, but the way the driver did was unacceptable. On 7:04 he didnt get level on the brake test. During the last run he didnt want to join the drag races, clearly there is something wrong with the tune and he is afraid of losing.
the porshe driver is a bag of cow shit he cant drive and he deserves 6 points on his licsense
The porsche driver is a raja and the worst driver and cheat ever!
A Porsche will always be a Porsche
One of the best drag 🔥 races
Cars are insane!!!
the Porche driver just yuck up the whole race.
Hey Mat, we want a rematch of the Porsche and the R8 please
That Porsche cheated on every race but the drag 🧐
Bad advert for ES but still a reputable company. That car needs a driver
Honk test please!
Who the fuck edited this?
Thought that was Arthur's TT. Nicks dad who is now around 76 years old 😂. Maybe he's sold or given it to Nick now but the old fella had that built.
The video felt so much better as soon as Ray pulled out of the last drag.
Porsche driver is actually an idiot, re-do this race
Nicks ttrs is shit coz hes a stingy git who didnt cough up! Watch his ttrs get smoked very soon by another ttrs
Club sport vs golf R
Why can't you give the owners their car to drag race since they know their cars better and then you guys ride shotgun?
What's up plz can you do a drag race with BMW with 1000hp and this audi with 1200hp plzzzzzzz
ESmotor slay TT and R8
that is a scary side of Yanny!!!!
porsche driver was making me mad lmfao
Where is my bloody wooke tookeeee 😂❤️❤️
rubbish test
Porsche driver cheated every chance he got. Pulled out on the last race, just when the other 2 cars worded out their issues.  Nevertheless, as much as I love Audi, I'd have the Porsche any day of the week. (Sell it and buy a couple of R8s).
Porsche driver is rubbish, LOL
1100hp porsche . Got damn it.
The latest illustration that tuner cars are a full-time job and mostly a waste of money. And not one of the cars would beat the Tesla Model S plaid which would do 9.2/9.3 seconds all day without all that drama.
Porsche driver is an idiot ! He cheated all rolling races because all time he come launched and also cheated at breaking test
The way he said the pedal is soft 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Porsche driver a complete idiot ! He literally cheated .so idiot!
The Porsche driver maybe was just super tried as they said he was up mapping to 5am, probably high af fro the fumes that why, he probably thought he was inline from this perspective. XD
On rolling race the Porsche cheats because he come launched ! He is an idiot !
O cara toca mal pra caramba o TTRS a.a.
That was so stressful to watch, loved it
The parallel skill paradoxically observe because hand sequentially charge like a wiggly herring. earsplitting, loving chief
Love all these cars, but the TTRS gets my vote. Used mk2 RS £15-20k in the UK and Storm Developments Signature Series 1300bhp cable turbo kit for £8k… Bargain. No idea where the total figures came from here even running Syvecs ecu etc. Check out IROZ motorsport for some crazy inline 5 cylinder action. TTRS and RS3 are absolute sleepers tuned. Ditch the drag brakes, and the 1450 kg RS would cream the other two in the braking :)
How to prolong any car video, bring a dude who can’t drive.
What’s wrong with the Porsche driver?!?
Best ever race till date. Thank you #Carwow and #Matwatson and whole team for so much effort.
Tesla Model S plaid+ VS Audi R8 plz
2.5 L with 1100hp, ya its gonna have a pretty high boost threshold.    Lag is how quick it spools once your past the boost threshold.  Boost threshold is the rpm where you can start making boost.  As you can see from the rolling race its basically dead below 5k rpm.
ES Motor might be able to build an ok car, but they can't drive
Do bmw 420i v 430i v m440i v m4 comp
The salt from all the people crying in the comments over the Porsche driver is hilarious
Alright my previous comment was made after watching just the sound test, after finishing the entire video I must say this is undoubtedly my favorite head to head so far. You guys killed it. 3 absolute rockets. Each of the owners were done proud in this race.
YANNI FINALLY WON A RACE albeit not in his own car! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 WE NEED MORE MODIFIED CARS ON CARWOW
This race was a bit of a mess.
Hi Mat! Can you please get another video 📹 camera above the racing cars, I would like to see how fast the cars are moving, yes I understand that you can drive up to 175m/h but I /we would like to see the faster the cars are moving.  Hope this request will be dealt with. Cheers 🥂 I'll appreciate your effort.
Everyone looked on edge in this video lol
Best sound test to date. Well done video as always Matt and the gang. Well done
that Porsche driver sucks
Someone get Ray a spirit level
Yianni's face last drag race
You should get DMO DEEJAY 1000HP AMG E63 ON THE SHOW
Ready to race. Yianni in his lean "mean" forward position. Matt in his lean "clean" backward position.
Because of high power cars, ADRENALINE spilling everywhere ❤️❤️❤️
All Porsche Stock is a Monster .. an this is the Devil 🤣🤣
Ray has no concept of 'being LEVEL' 🤣
Ray has just ruined the whole video, get a proper driver in that Porsche
R8 and 911 sounded hot
The video was nice until Janni's face showed up...👎
Ya that Porsche driver was an idiot but let’s be real, that Porsche is just on a different level than any Audi
Please do old amg's that would be great  Love your work Matt
Why does Yianni drive so close to the steering wheel lol majority of races he does this lol
Tuned cars, nothing but fucking trouble
I thought it was Arthur's TTRS
Most exciting drag and roll race of this channel for me….i have waited for it from very long time…..since i have a tt and i am building it….i have a 911 and i builded it and next year i want to buy and then build an R8 exactly like thisssss!!!!!!!!!
TTRSガチの崖で大好き
I’ve never seen Mat look so scared, lol.
waiting for plaid
9 seconds on an unprepared track is absolutely ridiculous. Amazing!
Stupid Porsche cheated.
In my a opion the porche is the fastest
Whoaa
The thing I hate the most with heavily tuned cars is, they're just too problematic not just their engines become so less reliable, but also hard to launch. The crazy modifications really mess its launch control notwithstanding the crazy speed.
Ray is a bit slow.
Man why the porsche? 🤦🏻‍♂️
That specific Audi TT sounds like a Lamborghini at high revs
Porsche kicked yannis ass again 😆
Absolutely love when yanni gets excited 😂😂
How can the Porsche won the brake test when he wasn't level? 😂
That damn porsche😑
LMAO Yanni didn’t even watching in front. His eyes were lock on the RPM meter.
that porsche driver tho xD
U
I could feel the pressure through my phone screen 😂 That was intense. Absolutely insane cars, Yanni deserved that win for sure haha
Double like right there, nerve-wracking race from the edge of my couch...;)
Fact: This video was shot on 10th May 2021
Matt and Yani for top gear presenters
porsche is a cheater
Porsche guy doesn't seem to understand what level means and yanni cant launch to save his life... bit of a wasted race
The morale of the story kids: tuned cars are rubbish 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼
That porshe driver cheated on everything. Shouldve got a driver that knew what they was doing knows what side by side means🤦‍♂️
The Porsche driver is such an idiot, this episode was a really lousy one :/
Ｍａｇｉｃａｌｌｙ  Ｄｏｐｅ.... Here i come ●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●
Cringiest carwow video ever.
This felt like a legit race!  Everyone had a team of people, and u could really feel the competition
Loved that
Ray doesn't know how rules work, don't be a douche like Ray
That 5 cylinder sound… so much reminds of the real deal S1 E2 Quattro……. Unbelievable engine and its capacity even nowadays…
Suits you sir!! 🏎💨
Times are insane!!!
The most enjoyable RACE so far.
Do a V10 drag race with a Carrera GT
This video was all over the place, I love it 🤣
The porsche peice of shite chicken shite
the audi R8 V10 is gonna win
Put MPH in the 1/4…
Matt, I want to see you run a X5 M against Yann's Uris
In the US we call launching at speed "rolling anti-lag"
Dont need launch control for this cars😭
Why the Audi TT sound more like the Audi r8
Modded cars = less reliability than a 70’s Austin 👎🏼 £250k for a Porsche that won’t drive 🤣🤷🏻‍♂️
I would love the Porsche 🤯🙆🏾‍♂️👌
Just show the race and cut the waffling.
I would love the Porsche 🤯🙆🏾‍♂️👌
That’s ttrs won’t last a year
What exactly happened?
Ray get level!!!!!!!!!! Brake test was useless
BuT sUpRa iS fAsTer
@carwow, you should do a drag race between mk8 Golf R, Golf GTI, M135i and 128ti!
ES Motor in the 911 guy is a CHEATER.  If you are thinking of having work done to your car, you might want to take this guy off your list--or bring a video camera and a lawyer with you to sign his contract.
Best video in a while!
Hi, Mat, Do please M8 competition VS M5 Club Sport
True race would be with manual transmission. True test of skill.
Why is the Porsche driver such a useless cheat
You had one job Ray 🤦🏻‍♂️
those 9 seconds on the r8 and the porsche must be reaaaly expensive compered to other car platforms. wow
911 turbo is in next level
Omg that R8 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 That douche porsche driver ruined the video, hopefully last one for him on car wow
If only yianni knew how to use rolling anti-lag it would of been like 20 cars lengths on both and would of ran in 8 seconds if launch control work for yianni
What the hell have they done to the exhaust tips of that 911
Every car was an absolute beast the boost in the TTRs , the speed of the R8 and how that 911 started car lengths behind and was still able to beat the two........🔥🔥
the guy in the Porsche as no idea what stay level means at all and cheated on the brake test
M5cs vs gt63s 4D vs tuned rs7 ?
Finally waiting for a 1000+ hp porche drag race is over❤️
Could the porsche driver be any worse.
That porsche ruined this entire video entertainment potential. Behaved like total cheater, then just showed how their car is unreliable - also their tune is not safe? that type of company advert  is saying to me as to a potentional customer:  well you better go somewhere else. We are just bunch of cheaters in every perspective.
Porsche was cheating , early start in drag race and not leveled in braking test
You need a better driver for the porsxhe lol
This was the worse co-ordinated race ever that i have seen here
1100 ttrs vs rs3 900 Bhp
Arthus ttrs not nicks or did he buy 1
This was a great episode.... Loved with 🇿🇦🇿🇦
Why did it change to a prerecorded shot for the Porsche revving?
As if the porsche wasn't cool enough already. mint
Porsche is a big cheater man🤣🤣 he don’t want to be fired
Really entertaining. Best cars channel on Youtube, no question.
At this point, carwow better start paying yianni
The Porsche guy was just cheating all the time. So annoying 😒😒
More of these videos 👌🔥
Ray doesn't know what "level" means...
We have a new king at carwow
Mat please do a aventador svj vs audi r8 both stock
wait the model S plaid !!!
These cars are terrible.. a lego car is more reliable than all three of them
never have the porsche driver back on ruined the video
This Episode was like a 13 minute Action Movie 🍿 ! 😃 ”1000hp War” Awesome !
Massive cheat Porsche
Hahahah this video is nuts! I am like 8 mins into it and have no idea what is going on
Eso sí es rápido 👍🇲🇽
I want a Rimac too! 😅
if Mat dies I die aswell
Does Yanni know how to drive these cars? I had doubts earlier and now even stronger. 😆
Do pangani Zonada
The porsche would have won the drag race
It could've just been a race between the two Audis, I'm sure it'd be a lot better. Lmao
R8 and 911 toooo beasty
Yeah 1000hp must be nice, if it ever bloody works
Porsche is the clear loser here:  DNFs in rollings starts & brake test due to cheating, and the slowest 1/4 mile.
Do this again but without a massive cheat in the porsche please! Should have been an amazing set of races. Get Jamie from officially gassed to drive it instead!
anyones else noticed the 991 instead of 911
I love you
Who’s the specialist driving the Porsche🤣🤣
What a mess. Stick to the straight from factory cars lmao
The Porsche driver is not deserving to drive that car. Porsches should never cheat. Great video, insane cars!!
Race some stock cars Because nobody buys a car like that and tunes it because there is no point 🤦
Do audi 1200hp vs BMW 1000hp
Evo 8 vs rx7
🤨🤨the numbers are incorrect, how did the porsche due 9.7s and the audi TT did 9.9s, when the TT won the first and second race. The porsche only won the 3rd but Matt messed up the shifting. 🤔🧐
Ray is one hell of a cheater. Tells me what kind of people there are at esmotor
Do videos cars or trucks that are imported to uk any indian cars
That Porsche is a force to be reckoned with🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ray is the worst driver 🤣
What’s up with that Porsche driver?! Made the entire video so damn frustrating to watch
Can you bring a Chiron to a drag race carwow?
Wow. Wow. Wow. WOW. Matt! What a race, we need more of stupidly powerful Audi performance drag races! 🔥🔥🤟🏼 Yanny pulled the game face on and went of to win it! 🏆
That porsche driver is garbage
Yanni is always doin the   "Yea I'm ready, then is NEVER ready"
More tuned cars please all these cars are mental.
That is why you buy a UGR tuned car.
The Porsche doesn't need to get leveled 😂
Let's all keep going. Until Yianni wins. 😀
Cars are so powerful, they're un-governable...
Ray in the Porsche is stupid, he kept cheating
I appreciate them showing the failures too
Team Yianni with the determination on his face. Cool race guys👌
The best drag race ever !!!
I love that yianni came to this insane race.
The Porsche driver was rubbish, cheating whenever he could. Took the fun out of it …
From the beginning of this wonderful video i know Porsche will win.
This is the most shitty video from carwow for a while, because these "overtuned" cars are mostly shitty. They can not deliver anything constantly, so you can not really compare them...
That TT is unreal
I really thought that the TT RS would explode. Excellent piece of kit this one!
This was the most mind boggling drag race ever....😁😁😁🇰🇪😁😁😁😁😁😁
The more I see videos with tuned cars the more I think I'd never do it, always something going wrong with them
As soon as I saw it was the Yanni bs again I cancelled the video and unsubscribed!
Good video , no advert shit at beginning . Thank you
At no point in any of the trials was the Porsche level.
This fucking ray just doesnt get it right
Audi r8 with hp 1000 no for lounch control onlr roling race, or in drag race roud....here is probem for wheels...and need yours only manual gearbox how now Yanny was))) yanny is good)
Where is the plaid model s in this race
Awesome vid mahn
Best so far… just best
Ray - just do your fkinb job and stay level
Ray with the prosche ruined the race
It's not often the cars actually look fast!!
Although the Porsche driver was being slow asf.. it still would have beat the cars, in first place! That car is like a jet with 1000hp still doesn’t give the driver a reason to cheat.
Holy shit. What a fvcking fast car
Damn that Porsche was nice, but driver kind of disappointed me.
Yanni...he is sooooo serious about the drag race hahahhahahhaa
Lol yianni 😝
Wtf wrong with the Porsche driver he can't seem to get the car level. Spoilt the video big time 👎
Shame the Porsche driver was so terrible, but good races none the less!
Porsche driver absolutely triggering me.. like it’s not hard to keep level 🤦🏽‍♂️
Yianni ruins it for me Typical KYPREOS all about him in every clip he is in
The TT was the “slowest”, but any of these cars would be crazy to see on the streets.
Wtf is wrong with that Porsche driver?!
What... a standard 911 does 9.9s and a tuned one with an extra 600BHP does 9.7s   :D
Porsche driver is a goon
The Porsche guy is a party pooper
so the car that wins stock wins tuned
Audi 👎👎👎👎👎🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Nice races m8
Nna too much problems
The owner of the Audi tt rs says it has 1400 BHP in his instagram acc @ 0:44
Nice the stats thing easy peasy
Porsche 1. Audi 0.
Wtf this ray guy spoiled all the races
6:36 you were in the wrong gear
It was superb race
Bunch of stupid cars....
Super exciting!
Guys, I love you. I'm from Russia and every day I watch your views! Please make a meal that has been tormenting me for a long time. BMW M8 Comgetation vs. Ford Mustang Shelby Gt500 or the usual Mustang GT, it would be very interesting to know the result! I hope Matt will see this comment, and will be able to organize such a food)
Spending all that money on the Porsche to make it less reliable and only save 3 tenths in the drag race hardly seems worth it....
The fact the Porsche normally runs 10.1s I don't think the 100k outlay is worth the .4 of a second.
new king the carwow
What happened during the drag race happens everytime you try to make plans with your friends, never goes smoothly lol
Looks like the Cicio Performance Porsche.
Do canam Maverick X3 vs polaris razor
Yeasss more crazy HP cars please
Do a drag race with the dodge demon with 840hp vs Porsche 911 turbo s 992
Autos in drivers cars😩,no thanks I'll stick to manual
Most amount of horse power was on the 1 milion subscribers celebrating race!
So the stock 911 Turbo does the quarter mile in 10.1 and this one does it in 9.7. Not much of a difference for all that extra money and hassle.
We want to see drag race with tesla model s plade
What the hell is this Porsche driver even doing 🤡 does he not understand what level means 🤣
Very good Porsche
I’ll love to see a tuned turbo s against these or that bmw m5
911 😘👍🙏
Porsche driver was horrible he was never inline with anyone and I like Porsche 😓 would’ve preferred a a more fair race
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣ray
Whats the first thing I do every time I switch on my pc, check out Carwow. awesome content and excitement.
and that's why supertuning VAGs is pointless. dsg is useless at this level, cars are too heavy and software is too complicated. 1000+hp with awd and no stick shifts, yet they struggle to get in the 9s..       .
Gotta have the owners drive at that point
Gotta have the owners drive at that point
Finally we have hp compared side by side. Thanks
These cars are on another level
Overly-tuned cars are no good. That was a circus show. It doesn't matter that they have so much power, if they can't reliably perform. The times you got, are kind of worthless.
This one was absolutely nuts, I got goosebumps from just watching this video. Anyhow, it is time for some off-roading and some tugs, you haven't made those in quite a wile now. Godspeed.
Yannis seriousness is so funny, how he sits forwards like he is going over the steering wheel haha
Sadly the worst race I’ve watched by you guys, the Porsche driver ruined everything.. I watch literally every single video for idk how many years. I love you guys but the Porsche guy ruined it..
No Horn test? This is not Carwow.
Cars 9 second,nice enggine upgrade
That was disappointing.
That Porsche driver brought a lot of outrage on him and his company.
I got a race for ya, buick grand national vs 89 trans am turbo vs turbo t-bird
That Ray guy doesn't know what leveling mean ..... smh
The best race ever 🥳🥳🥳
Hire some real drivers next time please; the third party driver always folds
The porsche is the best
That clown in the Porsche is ruining this video and I haven't even watched the drag race yet. Seems you can't trust the people at ES Motors.
That Porsche was not level on the brake test
New title edit: TTRS v R8 and Rey in his 911 does whatever he feels like.
An idea: next time when you do the brake test put specialist timing gear in each car so we can know exactly in how much distance did the cars brake, so it'll be irrespective of the driver's reaction
Very entertaining
This was a sick run!   Waiting for the bike race though
Yall should do another 1000hp 🏁
TT RS sounds soo good
Ray cheated in the break test 3:21 TTRS 3:31 R8 3:57 911
Iroz. That’s all I have to say.
Porche cheated in every race and he didnt realise 😂😂😂
Tuned Toyota chaser
Lesson learned: don't tune the car.
The guy in the porsche was a bit of a spoiled sport I reckon. I don't believe for a second the engine was getting too hot. He didn't even complete the first 2 attempts of the drag, where did all the heat come from?
That Porsche driver just can’t race fair wtf.
Ray Ruined this video,please never feature him again
Yani’s face when his car kicked to max speed😂
Porsche guy repeatedly cheated. What a disgrace for whoever it is you are representing, never on this channel has someone came on and took it that seriously that they cheated the way you did.
Why never normal cars?
Mad editing
Investing in Crypto is a lucrative and a big chance to make money online nowadays 💥
The 911 is the fastest car. Driver is terrible. But just look at rolling race. Says it all.
Porsche...worst case of cheating ruined the vid
What a cheater the Porsche driver is! Rolling race and brake test!
Dude in da Porsche waz just everywhere
What a whiny little poor loser baby mat is…..unreal
short shifted in a auto car lmao 🤣🤣
guy in the r8 is very bad driver
why is the moron in the ttrs dudes in comfort mode and auto wtf… should’ve taught the noob how to drive it
AHHHHH AHHHHH WHOA
i’d take the porsche anyday
5 cylinder hanging with a v10 is pretty damn impressive.
Plaid. Case closed.
Ray you’re fired
Let us know when Ray comes out of his coma.
Sad to see a cheater in a *Porsche*      ...not implying anything, just plain disapointment
Go to 12:24 and pause it. The faces 😂
Great video guys!! 👍👍
yyeeeeeeeesssssss
Porsche driver must daily a clapped out civic, trying to do driveby's every time
These are missile launching
Crazy to think the new turbo S would be right there with these tuned monsters
oil leak city?
Here before the million
Tuned cars are nice... When you got another 11 cars or something!
Yo. Good video!
Here’s to you, Ray. 🖕
Oh wow! You guys decided to race when it’s not raining! Good for you!
I was honestly expecting slightly better times since stock 911 992 Turbo S can do almost the same times as the 991 and TT RS.
Wow...that TT Ras boost though🚀
The worst race ever I seen in carwow
PLS GET YOUR HANDS ON A TESLA PLAID!!!!
OOOO both unbelievable!!
🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷
What’s so weird to think is that the completely stock rimac is faster than all of those by a second.
Wth is wrong with the porshe driver? Is he new?
We need that evolve M5 and R8
This was a great video! So much fun!! 🚀🔥
yianni asking questions and the telling the guys the answers
there we go yianni
You guys always have car issues and it's getting iritating.... Make sure the cars work/know how to drive them before you start recording...
Major fail for the Porsche.  Cheated in every test and only 0.4 seconds faster than a stock 911 Turbo S!!
The race was pure chaos 😂😂😂 nothing going well
That’s the best time on carwow 9.4
I love Porsches, but the guy driving that one is a cheating bastard!  Each rolling race, "I'll hang back and get a run up just before the start". Ditto the brake test.
Yianni looks like bowser driving in Mario kart 😂😂
Matt: Let me talk about this *Audi* Also Matt a few seconds later: Let's move on to the *Audi*
Matt need to understand that car wow is about cars and not him winning races
The r8 is about as fast as a 765LT
Can that porsche guy NOT cheat?
Love ur video ❤️‍🔥
Fuck this Ray guy man literally ruined the video
A stock Porsche twin turbo should do better than 9.7.
Bring Lewis Hamilton and his f1 car
Love it 😋 So actually we're 1st rimac nevera, 2nd tuned audi r8 a'd 3rd ferrari sf90... But all today's cars were in nine 😍 hurry to see the next in this range
1100hp from a 4.2L? sounds very conservative
The energy of this one is so chaotic. Its like I don’t know where to look
Insane fun and race! FF10 approved
Porsche driver is trash
These flybys are NUTS!
Brake test: Ray, you’re fired. Drag race: Yanni, you’re fired.
PLAID! Want to see it
Loving Carwow more and more. Now we have teams with the drivers explaining back and forth to get the maximum performance out of tuned cars. Real world racing. 😀
You know what you should race next or review next Jeep Grand Cherokee trackhawk
turbo s would never lose LOL
Need a drag race with the gt2rs
Yianni did that R8 justice Twin turbo R8, daily driver with a rocket strapped to it, actual dream car right there
prius vs unimog
Bring a Porsche and it's a race for 2nd.
We want a bugatti dragrace
I’m a fan of the Porsche but not ray lol
Best believe that the TT  has the sexiest, sweetest, smartest and smileiest name
I will always choose blue. 😁
Never seen Yianni so stoked. 😤😤🤣Must have been ethanol fumes.
https://youtube.com/user/lemmey08
The porch cheated as f
Thanks guys. I’ll get a Tesla. Lol.
What a chaotic clip. These tuned cars are crap. One doesn’t launch, the other one doesn’t boost and then there’s the Porsche. Everytime Theres tuned cars there’s always a shitload of excuses.
Can u drag race buses 😂
I am gonna watch this video again to understand "What exactly happened".
Never seen soo many tense faces
Could have a whole best bits of just yiannis facial expressions 🤣🤣
R8- even without launch is bonkers
This was the most messed-up drag race ever.
Doesn't a stock Porsche do like a 10s quarter mile?
The Model S Plaid does the quarter in 9.25. So it would smoke all three of these
911 brake cheated
911 cheating a lot
Tuned cars. Would u be bothered 🥴
Awesome race guys!😸
Someone tell the dumb Porsche driver what "level" means
Don't feature tuned cars in the channel because they are unreliable or their owners are douchbags wannabe's like the oner of the Porsche.
No!  That Porsche was Faster every time
audi R8💯👌
I'm guessing the Porsche shop won't be invited back...shameful behavior. But a very impressive race nonetheless, it's pretty incredible how you guys produce all these; even if there is a "formula" of sorts it still takes a lot of organization and work and coordination to make it happen to give us content so thank you.
Its a shame really because the TT is "cheap" but my dad says its a girl car .-.
Most entertaining drag race lineup yet. Good editing also!
yeah need to twin the TTRS. can just use the Bi-Turbo system from the R8
The Porsche cheated literally every race
wow that was legit intense! ha
lot of amateur :D come on guys... what do yo do?
Ray is a Karen LOOL
Some dumb Porsche driver jokeman
The SE Sport driver, wouldn't invite him back, thought it was funny slingshotting every rolling race (no doubt moving quicker than 50 and on boost), and holding back on the brake test... this show only works because they genuinely try to play right... R8 quickest, then the 911 and then the TT... all fast, but against a 765LT... yeah, no chance.
Best video so far
The guy in the Porsche must work for UGR
Isn't the TT owned by Arthur from the LLF channel?
That tuned M5 is still my favorite. Is it time to do stage 3 tuning to keep up to the Audi?
Ray needs to be fired for he's pathetic efforts
one nil to me..
Is that Arthur’s TTRS??
One of the best videos to date
this video really highlights the reality of having an insanely tuned car
Credit to Yianni for launching that manually and still smashing the time
4:20 your welcome
tuner cars are complete shit.
Yanni takes these races seriously 😂
can u do a drag reace whith Audi rsQ8 and cayenne Turbo s and gls amg and x6
Mr. Middy Wadner can not bring himself pronounce Porsche correctly .. in fact he absolutely refuses. I don't quite understand.  Love how stoked these guys were in this.
When the TT hits boost that shit is TERRIFYING🤣
I want a race just between the porsche and the r8
This Porshe driver are so bad
can you do 1000 hp supra vs 700 hp supra
mat bring the supra mk4 1000Hp please
BONKERS! CRAZY!
ES guy is absolute crap at getting level lol.
Love the tuned races.
I think the key is keeping the TTRS in the 6-7k RPM rang before its boost begins to taper.  Keep it dead even in its powerband so the engine load is ideal for air flow.
SF90 vs this audi R8 !!
That porche can make 1600, ES Motor posted a video with it in May...
Animals
Very nice
Vag crew.
How did no one spot the Porsche cheating in EVERY challenge?!
the guy in the Porshe is an idiot
That R8 is sickkkk
this channel is a continuous advertisement AGAINST tuning shops
Good fun video.. Could see yani was big time competitive and really really wanted to win.. He got real excited.. Nice one guys
Matt isn’t using the ttrs it’s full power. Cars like this are very hard to drive and only the tuners and owners it’s self know how to put all 1100hp to the ground! So let the owners that know the car in and out do a dragrace!
3400hp combined - Is this the record in a Drag race?
Starting to think Yanni is a little bit competitive 😂
Do the drag race last every time 😎😎😎
Get level Porsch driver 🥴 😂😂😂
Turbo charged supra and other supercars
LOL Porsche driver went full dumb mode.
That r8 vs the sf90!
being a superbike owner i can almost feel the acceleration these cars have bt still dude.....that feeling of accelerating this fast is amazing
That tt 😵 🥵
imagine a tuned 992 that would be mental
es motor the best
Let’s see a Kia Stinger race Matt!  Tuned versions are hitting over 700bhp.
Incompetenti
Cmon Ray!
Porsche doing everything to suck off his tuning company lmao. Cheating on brake tests and rolling race.
The Porsche would've had it if someone competent had driven it. Talk about F-ing it up.
While I'm a fan of Porsche, and I expected it to win, WHY don't you actually do some trial runs before recording? While Mat and the Greek God are both VERY capable at launching and racing cars at this point, how about you give the newcomers a short "how to" BEFORE the official race? The Porsche driver was all over the place, and acted like he just stopped by for some  tea.   This is honestly why you should have the same drivers every time. It's make or break depending on who's driving the damn car.
Guys U haven't done any review for the Bugatti lineup
Only thing Matt brakes so hard even with space no wonder brakes are fucked already
Mat was heat soaking his car before the race smh
Anyone ever thought just maybe matt and yianny can't drive them cars to the full protential, even once rolling the porsche was offffffff
Ray is gay ! Don’t include him fuck noo
I love how yianni ist talking to that R8 guy very often and Mat is just having the time of his life
Matt cant drive for shit.Short shifting and smashing it to red line all the time
It's surprising how unreliable those tuned cars are.
That’s why i don’t wanna tune my car if i ever buy it😅
Lol the thumbnail said 991 turbo
Just bring a stock 992 911 turbo s
As expected- a clear win for the AMG!
Thought the TTRS belongs to Arthur... Nicks old man? Sure nick has the R35 GTR?
Audi tt best sound
That 2.5 liter TTRS sounds like a V12 Damm 🤏👓😳
Cars are best
Toretto would approve. 10sec cars.
Andrenalin increase when looking, how is  it in race 🤐😨😨😨😨😨
Rolling race scuffed, brake test scuffed, drag race scuffed…wow
That TT is an absolute f***ing monster!!!
best ever
Come on!
The editing in this is sh…… The Drag Race a Wohle mess. These cars kill
Tuned cars. The highs. The lows. The lows.
Damn and all lose to Jay Leno in a Tesla
nah the porsche driver isnt cheating porsche is just that good
I haven't watched the video but i see tuned cars so definitely there will be an error with them
These tuned cars. Phew.
What a muppet in the Porsche!
if there is one thing that i truly appreciate is yanni always being so intense when racing.
You cant hate an R8 or 911 but the 5cyl ttrs has a special place in my heart. Those things are literally insane
The Porsche beat both of your asses and the guy driving it didn't even speak a word!
A stock 911 turbo s woulda competed no problem with these tuned cars😂
please we need more tuned car its beautiful😍
Why can Ray not follow basic instructions? 😂
Can you review or race a V12 Q7? Please….!!!!! Unicorn drag race! Most rare v12s or v10s that are quick?
What drugs was Yianni on throughout that vid? lmao
... and 0 to 60 mph in ??
you need to put the m5 f90 with 1000hp😎
Nik from Lff with is dads rs maybe ?
This video is a great advert for not tuning your car.
That's nuts
TT RS crashed in reliable. Insane!!
Hi, how are you?, Mat Watson here from Carwow! I got a bonkers drag race for you today. I'm ...           No I am not transcribing the whole video
Wow, this episode was a shitshow
The Porsche cheated every run! Lol
Porsche driver don’t do ES any favours cheating. Embarrassing.
That's R8 I'm taking
Blue Porsche wasn't level
Why on earth would you spend 90k build on the turbo s when the new turbo s 992 can do it in 10.1 sec over and over again without fail and no issues 650bhp
That Porsche driver was a major cheat. Ruined the whole video.
That TTRS 😨
What’s nuts is there are all 9sec cars. Sheeesh
Would have been good if porsche hadn't cheated on rolling starts and brake test.
8:45 - ржу в голосину))
Reshoot the video with someone who knows what he's actually doing in that Porsche. Stupid driver can't even follow basic indications.
That was class 👌
I think the TTRS is the most fun to drive
Porche driver was a tool.
Its not nick's AUDI TT, it belongs to his awesome father Arthur
255/45 r17??? WTF????
This.. is.. carwow! -Kicking the gaspedal!
Best one yet Matt, love the tuned car content! We appreciate peoples builds and love for cars!! AUDI BABY 🔥🔥 you brought it home Yanni x
Just let the people who built the cars race them
You just killed 3 tuners brands😅
yanni is terrible!! He cant do anything without launch control!!
😂😂😂😂Yianna so so funny
Porsche driver is a cheat!!! Ruined the video
Like everyone else I couldn't say anything complimentary about the Porsche driver. He had gone before everyone else on the rolling races, was on the brakes before the line in the brakes test so I was shocked he managed to start from the same point as everyoine else on the drag race. What this video does show is that tuned cars are great when they work but a bundle of hassle the rest of the time.
Mat u forgot to say too subscribe to Yannis channel, may I think he is pissed
The porsche driver has nothing under control! He cant get level, he brakes too early and he jumped the start. DISQUALIFIED
What happened to the TTRS ? Owners were saying it was going to run 8's...120k later and it's running high nines. That's not good value for money.
Truely enjoyed this one 😍
Porsche driver cheated in every race and the brake gets too!!
stock 720s 9.7 stock 765lt 9.3 yet these are all highly tuned and have problems
Omg when I saw the title I was so excited that I thought I was gonna power the city
The most unorganized CarWow ever, and I fucking love it lol.
For me the TT seemed the most reliable of the 3, if you tuning for such power rather built it up, seems things work better that way. ES was disappointing!
The Porsche keeps cheating lol
Tuned cars are insane and crazy, but they're just so damn unreliable.
superb
Porsche 💯 %
So a standard Porsche Turbo S does 10.2 sec....... ok! Good job Porsche, how you do it no one knows lol
Do a drag race with gt3rs new one with 510hp
What’s with the Porsche.. smh
Porsche 911
Lol Porsche only won the rolling race becuase he was already speeding up to catch you 2 up as he was far behind.. think that was a tactical move by him.
This could have been one of the best drag races we have ever seen on this channel! Even though there was so much going wrong all 3 cars are insane! Keep on coming with more videos, i try to watch them all.
Would never get a car choooned at the garage the Porsche comes from, batty boys cheating at racing, imagine how they cheat when you spend money. Had no confidence in their car so felt the need to blatantly cheat.
I want a 2000hp car vs a 2,020hp car
Did anyone see how Ray launched before the start 😂
That 911 driver has problems.
5:02 - yianni becomes mario
Agree with everyone on here, Porsche guy cheated. Jumping the rolling races and braking early on the brake test. Then bottles the last drag race.
Its amazing that a fantastic sounding v10 engine was bested by a ludicrous 5 pot? That tt sounds godly
Should’ve let the owners drive the cars lol all you guys were struggling.
Porsche driver knows he’s beat so he cheats by taking a running start on the roll races.
best drag race you've done! loved it
Disqualify the 911 an please don’t let that guy back on the channel. Ruined it
Yanni sounds like Mario 😂😂😂
lol the cheater smurf driver, they best do these with 1 driver only
I wish you can include the speed with the time after the drag races
Fiat multipla pls
Mate next video Lamborghini Hurricane vs This tunned R8 please!!!!!!!
12:06 My response when someone asks if I want some ice cream
Don’t let that Porsche driver drive again. He was never level for any race or brake test like wtf u doing bro
Tesla model S PLAID  will be 2 seconds faster than those over priced Wiener schnitzels and 1/3 the price 😂
Yanni and his “finish him” face 😂
That Porsche is totally disqualified in every race. Even brake test he slowed down earlier then the others. “Loser” - J. Clarkson
10:18 Popcorn's ready
Moral of the story.... Don't buy tuned car.
That porche
Song at the end please?
his last race...
The Porsche driver Blatantly cheated in a couple of those  or he don`t know how to drive his own tuned car.
Ray cheats
You know the cars are fast when they become quiet
anyone else see the porsche on officially gassed
Haven’t watched the video yet but it seems the dude in the Porsche doesn’t know how to drive his car properly.
How hard is it to get level with the other cars to produce a solid fair race? Ffs money really doesnt buy brains
1200 hp and a whole bunch of torque ... KnOwLedGe
Does the Porsche driver not know how to drive or something?
Really look forward to yiannis competition mode
Looks like the most fun mats had in a while 😂
Matt was too anxious to win
One word.... Plaid seems like a bargain now
This needs a billion views fam
Usually Audi can’t put its power down to the wheels either way
Now how about making drag races with articulated buses??? Since you did a Scania vs. Mercedes lorry race...
someone fart . matt smelling the fart and says 3:16
where the M5 when u need it
Tt needs to be kept in high high revs at all times. I know its way more capable so is the audi. Bring me to your next run i want in all three cars independently and will prove all those cars can do better.
Summary of Ray: Hang back during roll races to accelerate before the others Hang back during the brake test Jump the start on the drag race.  👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽 way to ruin the video! 🤦🏽‍♂️
You finally do the MK2 some justice 🔥🔥
Ray is a cheat
Put somone like me.in that tt that can drive it the results will be staggering different.
This race was insanely fun 🤩
Don’t invite the Porsche guy back.   Clear cheating getting it moving before the count down form 40 yards back.  He knew exactly what he was doing.
The R8 needs to be in performance mode otherwise launch control won't engage.
Best drag race till date !!
Now that’s  one hell of a race what we deserve....
The Audi TT turbo spoiling like vtec 🤣
The r8 should of won everytime on the drag race, whatever company built the r8 has a lot of R&D to do still 😂 sad watching this then watching sheepey race r8s destroy everything in their path
9.4 on an unprepped surface, damn! That audi’s flying, faster than an SF90
Mat how about some old school cars anything thats 400 plus hp. 90s onwards.
Fiesta ST v new Hyundai i20N when you get hold of one!
If you can't trust your own car to race it fairly, why would i trust you to modify mine😖
for 1000+ hpr i expected faster 1/4 times
R8 (1200hp) v 911 Turbo (1100hp) vs mclaren 7 20s
Now I was to see Tesla model S plaid VS
The Porsche's slingshot ability looks much more mental
And to think that Rimac could destroy all three of them easily...
Pretty cool seeing my car but with 1100hp!
I would be so curious to see these cars race with an sf90 stradale!
Ray in his Porsche does not seem to understand simple English.
why is Porsche driver cheating all the time, honestly ruined the video for me...
Elisha liang
Porsche driver thought he's really smart lmfao
Where is the Evolve BMW M5 Competition?
Arthur I thought owned the Audi,Nicks dad. Not as quick that's been made out. Claimed 100 -200 in just under 3 secs and 9.9 quarter mile. 🤔 That R8 is bloody quick though
Porsche driver is a right prick
Wow 9,4s that's mental. Was that the quickest ever?
OMG !! I HAVE BEEN WAITED LONG TIME
Wow what a rushed thrilled video. My hands are sweating just watching 🤣🤣
Why are you driving the R8 in dynamic and not performance mode?
Disappointing behavior from the porche wanker, don't invite him back, replace him with the 1000hp built m5 for the next drags, oh and drag out a tesla plaid or what ever its called
very nice video. enjoyed it a lot
You can tell ray was a Asian Bradford boy
Man it is an amazing race
Wow!
Geweldig 👍👍👍 audi!!!
Would love to see the BMW M5 tuned by evolve against the blue BMW M5 with license plate F9 LLF. Both are 1000hp
The level of the cars on Carwow's Drag Race is getting greater and stronger ❤❤❤
Still slower than a 765lt 🤷
Lol Yianni is really passionate lol
OMG, that porsche is quick, even if he lined before the lining up, he would won🔥🔥
1000hp bmw m4 would gap them easy
Brake boost!!
Bruh the porshe is just insane
When can we please have a modified SF 90 FERRARI PLEAS
The Porsche driver even cheated in the brake test. What a clown
I am now 100% sure that tuned cars are just not worth it. Especially if you're planning to use your car...as a car and not just a show horse on track. Even then it's probably not worth it imo.  Yianni's expression at 10:17. LOL!
Pulled up in Birmingham at 10:42
It's like a science driving these tuned cars
Porsche "991"
The best part is the expression at 12:01
Man i love your crazy show. You are the king of drag races! Sick cars 🥰
Next drag race:bugatti veyron supersport vs chiron sport vs divo vs    centodienci vs bolide please meke this video i dont know how did you make this video but please make it
This race would’ve been soooooo much better if you guys had been prepared before the race and actually test the cars so you don’t look like idiots when it comes down to launching it and stuff.
NEVER let ES Motors drive their own car on this Channel!
The Porsche driver is so amateur.
God that guy in the porsche is a clown 😂
Lets be honest, Ray , you cheated with piece of crap
if I ever feel the need to run away from my sins, i'd get that R8
why wins to long 13min wait ?
you all have to make a race between BMW m335i n55 and M2 2020
GREAT VIDEO!!! How funny is Yani 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Scummy Porsche driver boooo.... trying to slingshot on the rolling races. The real races were between the two Audis. That r8 is pretty mental, loved the video!
This had the potential to be one of the best races ever but it was so disorganized and the drivers really didn’t know how to use their cars, except for the Porsche of course.
Typical that little man Ray didnt want to do another race when Yanni was just getting his Groove in......
yanni's face 🤣🤣
I read the comments before I watched the video but then I watched the video and I understood 🤣 the Porsche driver sucks, or doesn’t Speak english because he did not understand anything else than the brake test 💀💀
Yaan is the best
So it all comes down to one thing: that tuned cars are like s**t... Cannot make a launch in conditions (Audi R8), after 2/3 launches, it has to cool the engine (Porsche) and has problems with gear changes, and it takes 3 days to create boost(Audi TT)! So what is the purpose of these cars anyway? just spend money to say they have more than 1000 hp????
When will these idiot modders learn you cannot improve on perfection
Porche saying the car is too hot. Sounds like a flaw to me, that TTRS did more full races than yours and did fine. Also didn't jump starts, slingshot rolling races, drop over a car length on the brake test. Seems to me someone was getting nervous and cheated their fucking socks off.
The worst cheater ever was the Porsche driver. He literally cheated on every challenge. Then wouldn’t even race at the end cause he knew the r8 was gonna get him. Bad look
This whole video was a mess. Not even was Matt or Yianni's fault.
Either the Porsche driver lost most of his brain cells standing behind his car inhaling those sweet fumes, or he's a cheating little weasel. Literally every single test. Yuck
It's so hard tuning that sportcars
That was insane.  Really loved this.  Keep em coming Mat 😂😂
Man that’s was one of the craziest, fastest, hilarious race in carwow…absolutely crazy!!
Esmotor'u okuyunca acaba dedim:) Hakaten biz yapmışız. Helal olsun.
Dear ES Motor. Those of us in the know are aware of your car’s speed, but don’t ever send this driver anywhere again.
12:01 and just pause the video.
Spoiler alert: the volkswagen won
Es motor is the best !!
Fun is fun ... but you are just look like idiots when you dont even know how to start these things. We have 2021... you drove almost every car on this world and you just cant do a proper drag? dont mention roll race (cant stay in line, falsh gear)?  Im watching you for more than 2 years but come on man ... all these bad starts and laughing on how complicated it is, in every video with a highly tuned car ??? Its starting to get annoying .
awesome race Mat ! Give more like this mate .... :)
6:03 ES motors were taking the piss ahah
Bring Tuned Mk4 supra For Drag Race
The best drag race ever.
the thumbnail says 991 turbo s lol
The Best Drag Race - hai sa vedem câți românași suntem pe aici 🇷🇴 💪
TT did a 9.9 with half the engine of the R8 .. mental. The true winner 👑
🔥
I miss the old intro "hi I'm Mat and I'm sat in an Audi TT" .......that was priceless
Shitty cars
Don't ever use ES again. That guy is a prick!😡😠
best car content
What’s the IQ of the Porsche driver?
Both of crying 😭.porsche is master
Best video ever
Nice R8
Let’s see what these cars can do up against the Evolve tuned BMW
Dudes this porsche is just flying 🔥🔥🔥 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
The Porsche driver was cheating so hard the whole time.Jumping the start going on one,braking early,not staying level in the roll race to get a slingshot.
Isn't it Arthur's car ?
Die können alle nicht fahren amk....
It's Arthur's isn't it?
matt is like a little kid in the tt rs
That was absolutely amazing 💯
Ray doesn't deverse a Porsche. He drives like a Hellcat owner
Порше с хода не правильно ехал
Tuned cars = 💩💩
90k worth of tuning on that Porsche and less than 1 second faster than factory. Wasted money
Fantastic video
That guy is a disgrace to Porsche absolutely ruined the video. You're that one guy who loses at everything so you try to cheat your way to win. That Porsche was built for people who like cars not human garbage gtfo
Kinda weird how low the torque numbers are on the R8. Was expecting more.
So the model s plaid is faster than all of these cars from standard 😂
Something about the Porsche’s initial rev was off.  Had to shop a video of it revving else where.  Seems like you can rev it on race day and still have same Car.
Audi Tits
In Brazil we say "Cavalo de Porsche é diferente" = "Porsche horsepower is different" hahaha inexplicable
Ray ruined that completely! Fool
Nick's TT? Did Arthur not want the limelight today??
TT RS is a spleeper, my favourite
That Porsche killed them
Porsche driver is a mess, loved the car drivers a bit of a shitter
Why not let the owners drive/drag them cars clearly you 2 have no clue how to drive them tuned cars or any you had on your channel
Porsche driver is 🗑️
never invite ray again ffs
Jesus. Just let the owners or tuners drive the damn things. Matt can't seem to get the shifts right, other dudes can't launch, don't know how the gearbox works etc etc etc. I still know nothing about how they run. So what was I watching?
the porsche was trying so hard to slingshot the other two (it worked) in the roll races... regardless all cars are AMAZING but my favorite is the R8. INSANE VIDEO!!!
More tuned car please :D
WTF, this channel is fucking on fire🔥🔥🔥
A rally cross type anti lag system on that tt and it would’ve been much closer on the rolling races! But 3 absolute weapons right there! Albeit hard work to get a good run in 😂
Lord Aleem Bugatti Chiron??
and people says germans do better than americans haha we see audi reliability. Americans can handle 2000+ hp. well done Porsche btw.
What a race guys we want to see more of these absolutely mental cars !!!
Tuner worked hard on 911 but failed him at the end
Too much talking
Never get that Porsche driver again on this channel ! Ruined everything !
These gangster types don't know much, their less-evolved and devolved minds have no intelligent making capacity, meaning they don't learn things that are real, they learn fake things. Like how it's somehow possible to get 1,100 horsepower from a 2.5L engine without making it impossible to drive. Or how the 3d studio max software they're using doesn't calculate newtonian dynamics into the calculation of the acceleration or movement of the fake cars. So the fake CarWow - it's really not intended to sell many cars, it's more about pushing stuff on people to make them think things. Like somehow, massively mistakenly, they think that it is reasonable to suggest that 20- or 30-  something men and women have the disposable income to spend 200k on a car. That money doesn't exist. It isn't hidden somewhere you don't know about, you know it as a formal exclusion of false information. I mean that it is impossible to believe that a 30-something man has legitimately earned anything more than 30-40k in a year in the last 2 decades. It's not possible. Why? Because you know what the price of things is. You know what you're going to say in response to a loser saying they've got a ferrari. Bullshit. You know that because you know the majority, i.e. all those customers that you're going to need to have in order to make free profit of enough to buy a lamborghini are people who don't have very much money to spend. They don't have 200 quid to spend on a sticker on an exhaust. Or have a car tuned. If you're spending 20k on a car upgrade, then that 20k is spent, isn't it. On salaries and stuff, which means stuff made by people, meaning salaries. In all, 20k takes a high earner probably the most of the year, depending on his outgoings. There are no people spending 80k on an 'upgrade' to an Audi TT. They are not going that. They are going to save a bit more and get a Porsche or a Ferrari. Which means they are one of maybe 1,000 people per year who are legitimately thinking about buying a high-end porsche. So there are no 30 year olds collecting that kind of cash legitimately because basically they're not able to get that much business because there aren't enough people out there to give him a million quid. It might happen once per year, globally, that someone is able to say that they've genuinely gone from nothing to 30 years old and a million quid in the bank for legitimate reasons. And that reason will be going away because it was a niche, now it isn't so there will be some form of competition, probably, to ongoing sales. And usually the point is they've already maximised the market, everyone who was going to want it was covered in the first two years and now they have repeat only customers. Something like that. There are no glossy success stories where someone has made megabucks in 5 years only to pile in on the housing market with billions of investor money and a nice smile on some magazine front cover. All those stories are fake. We know what happens to those people, those rare individuals who have an idea which could change the world - we know they are oppressed, the hidden, the rigged to explode with family shame, the slander and destitution, fake stories about infidelity and molestation... If you make a great thing, the system around doesn't let you succeed, unless you make allegiance to criminal operations and intentionally allow someone to steal all your gains. You simply aren't allowed to gather enough money that you could represent a threat in the future. So these cars are all about rewards to gangsters. See a young guy in an expensive car - it's stolen, he didn't pay for it in any real work. It was a favour. And that favour coupled with other favours represents organised crime. It's one way to look at it but meaninglessly is a hope to identify that they don't really think anything is illegal if they've got some representation that what they're doing is authorised somehow. So they get these cars when they complete these authorised tasks - like reskinning a particularly 'hot' i.e. being tracked car that's an Audi TT and build into it a huge engine so they can get away if they police come to get them. More or less they get given these cars as a kind of salary and use it to brag about town. They're there because they're put there by orgniased crime bosses to incentivise people to live their way rather than the real way because it looks like the epitome of a dream to have nice cars and uber-expensive apartments in the city center. Then you look at how many of them are and you see a gigantic team of people who work directly for organised crime which includes theft of money from bank accounts, stealing money in the name of utility bills - it was always illegal by the way - stealing everything they can and over-pricing everything because ultimately the system they have doesn't support itself. The reason real life doesn't include 25 year olds driving lamborghinis is because real life can't support it. There's no way a 25 year old is going to be able to expend the effort that goes into each Lamborghini - 40 years of performance car making experience is something that a 25 year old is not old enough - his experience doesn't earn him money as much as the 40 years at lamborghini, 40 years of careful labour on one-off cars, more or less... So he can't occupy his time with any activity that someone else isn't more able to do at an older age. So the point is they can't possibly have earned enough because they're not experienced enough and there isn't a magic alternate-reality where that does happen. It doesn't. Sometimes there are rare examples because of technology changes, like my engine, but that happens once a generation, if you're lucky. They want you to believe that kind of success exists everywhere, hidden in the cracks where you can't afford to look.
They should have also ran a stock 911 turbo s for comparison. Half the HP and its within 4 or 5 10ths of all these cars. But it can also launch perfectly and run optimal every time. It would have beaten at least one of these other cars on every run because of how temperamental they are.
Defo could do a redo without the porsche driver, was pretty pointless if the idiot can't listen
that porsche driver
BORING !!!!!AND POINTLESS !!’
911 driver,,, wot a cheat!!
100-200
it was the best show 🤣😮😮😮😮🥇🥇🥇🥇😎😎💣💣💣👑👑👑👑👑
Porsche cheating every time
R8  King 🤴
the tt rs is better than the r8 the tt has a v5 2.5 and the r8 a v10 5.2 and it was so close even tho the tt rs engine is literally 1/2 size of the r8
Please don't bring the Porsche driver on again, was looking forward to this. He ruined it.
The Porsche driver is shite  But the car itself is batshit insane, quick as a bullet without a doubt!
Yanni transforms into Bruce Lee @ 4.40... enter the dragon :)
all that effort and money only to put those exhaust pipes on that porsche, disgrace.
Finally getting to see what this ttrs can do!!!
holy sht i loved it
Drag race should always be the last to keep all emotions at the end 🤘
It’s quite clear that you would have to be an idiot to take your car to es motors.  Considering the shenanigans they tried to pull here, this is the kind of outfit that will charge you for forged pistons and put in something from a Dacia instead.
Absolute menace that R8 is.
Wow just wow 😯
Nahh you’ll be fine
In the TT how does the transmission cope with all that torque? Is it still a DSG?
Porsche being Porsche...
Great video.
That was insaaane!! Loved that race. Might be my favorite to date.
I think Porsche isauch faster than the other two
Video starts in 07.30
Great video
I really like this channel. This video is one of the worst I have seen here. Porsche’s driver can’t get leveled with others.. Mat hits rev limiter or starts to low with a huge amount of turbo lag.. Yany can’t launch but it was not his fault (this time hahah..) This challenge should be done better to show real car’s performance.
Best episode ...
This was a pretty awesome video! And Oh yeah, Fuck that Porsche driver! lol
Don't invite the Porsche driver on the channel again, he's a cheater!!
Mat vs yiani perfection of drag race🔥
You get a like for a dry track for once. 😂
Please make a race between Bugatti Veyron vs Rimac Nevera.
80k on tt mods...mental
whoever the Porsche driver was, never get him on the show again.
I knew matt would win the drag race 1000bhp but less weight than all the others  thought yanny would be quicker in the rolling race
That Porsche driver is a little worm
11:53 yiannis multi kill face playing call of duty
Ray listens as well as my 3 year old.
Yanny- Mate I need u to set this up for me in manual sport mode….  Also Yanny, getting cutting every time the dude tries setting up and explaining 🤦‍♂️
Can you get poacher 918 on the vido
AWSOME VIDEO!
Porsche bloke ruined the whole thing - so desperate to cheat. Should’ve stayed up til 5 learning what level means not working on the car
I’m looking forward to a drag race with the new Tesla model S plaid sometime next year
How fast was Matts first dragrace attempt? (where Jannie did not get off the line) It seemed perfect.
Porsche has cheating, best time R8
What is wrong with Ray???
Please race golf mk 7 gti, clubsport and R against mk 8 gti, clubsport and R.  All at once😬
10;44  who 's family is that?
More of these videos
Put them all next to a Tesla
Awesome video.  I also love how everyone is roasting the Porsche driver.  Much deserved for that piss poor driving.
Epic fail!
Hellou Mat, better than you Thanks Hellou Yani
So he spent 90k to shave .4 off and make it much less reliable? 👍
Matt get a Ultima RS on the channel just ask ultima sports 1200bhp 950kg would be amazing.
Can you also put in the tuned M5
That was awesome, never seen Jani so intense at a drag race 🤣
Man the Porsche driver sucks. Slingshot racing and braking early. Lol
How is the Porsche driver such an idiot
Respect for the R8 👌🏻🔥😜
Instead of the cheating Porsche you should of put living life fast m5 in this race that would be insane
Someone should make a lot of shit funny compillation out of Yanni and Matts reactions. We really need that hero!
Dude can't drive that Porsche!
Should leave the Porsche stock lol or stage 1 is more than enough...
This vid is such a mess! 😂😂
Yani 🤣🤣🤣🤣looks like he was possessed by the DEVIL 👿
That porsche is a beast.
Porsche driver:           Hey Porsche driver, you are supposed to say something whe you see “:” so…  Porsche driver:… not my day
Never mind the price, give me the R8 every time.
Thank god R8 won or else he will want a rematch again and again and again until he gets to win🙄
Best Episode i´ve ever watched <3
Yanni changing the gears in the last drag is all i am here for.
Waooh, what a drag race !
thanks so much for  the best drag race video ever, 3 mental cars in their own right.
En español pir favor
Thought the ttrs was Arthur's not Nick's
please ditch the tuned cars as they represent nothing
The Porsche driver not only cheated in the rolling race and brake comparison, but also found out that the other two cars on its best condition may quicker and deliberately did not participate in the third race (because he knew he would lose). The worst driver in the carwow race.
0:30 i hear 8k pounds of work,than i realoaded and was 80k
I think after these tuned-car videos nobody is going to go to those shops to damage their cars for more power...
A stock 911 TS constantly does 10.1s on this channel. That car must be able to do better.
How can’t you love the seriousness Yanni brings to every drag race?
90% of the comments dissing the Porsche 10% talking about everyone dissing the Porsche 💀
R8
thats was a drama wasnt it !
Crazy how 'standard' 911Turbo would be just little behind.
AUDI!! YES 👍🤝🤝🤝🍾
This drag race was all over the place 🙄 and stop bringing Yianni he's not funny anymore 😒 I prefer your mom 👩‍🦳
wenn ma das so sieht was für amateure nehmt nächstes ma profis
The guy in the Porsche just kept cheating. Not impressed at all
Who was driving that Porsche, Mats Mum?
Lmfao this was somewhat of a shit show but still entertaining 😂😂😂
Try British Leyland drag 🤣
That was a great race
Super Awesome video❤️ but Matt needs to check his mirrors 😂.
Porsche driver is garbage. Can't follow simple directions
The tune made on that porsche wasn't well made and the owner knew it damn well and that's is the simple motive he cheated in almost every part of the race IMO.
The Plaid has less HP and has a faster 1/4 Mile time
10:13 the tt shifts sounds fkng insane
Make a diesel dragrace
I want that R8 beating the 911 in dragstrip. In this video it is splitted.i want it RAW 🔥
Crikey, chill out drivers, be a bit more polite to the car owners too, cocks 😂
Do a race between a 2021 Audi RSQ7 vs 2021 Volkswagen Touareg R vs 2021 BMW X6 M Sport vs 2021 Mercedes-Benz GLE Coupe AMG 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Mess!!!!
Congrats to Yanni!! He adapted himself to the tuned R8.. Most tuner would agree that R8 would be one of the best cheaper Twin Turbo supercar project that can go up to 2000hp. Would like to see TT Lambo VS TT R8 and other “same level” car
Wow that R8 is lit 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Tuned car really are shit aint they, one trick pony springs to mind
,🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
Porsche guy ruined it tbh
To much Ads 👎👎
Guys, Matt is getting old. Now he needs the stats shown on screen for him 😂😂
Loving the videos. Ever thought about a performance diesel video. I'd happily bring along my BMW 123d
In 2 out off 3 races I would have beaten the Porsche and Audi R8 with my Volvo which have 200 hp, because of the unreliability of these tuned cars....less is more...
I know Porsche would win
Great idea to increase your watch time!
Sounds like thunderstorms revving 3 German beasts. Wow
More yanni forsure
The most unreliable race of course are custom built 1k hp cars
Do better Ray.
Yanni you need a Jubilee bracelet on that Batman man !
Best drag race .... Fantastic
And then imagine a normal Tesla salon going the 1/4mile in 9.2sec 🤣🤣🤣
It would be fun to see a ugr lambo or r8 here
this video was at another level... yanni all firedup
They should do the brake test first
ray can’t drive for shit
Those V10s sound so nice!!
Yesss more of these tuned cars!
The Audi and the Porsche's sound is amazing but the TT's sound is on an another level sounds badass
THAT R8 IS GORGEOUS
Ttrs driver doesnt know how to drive turbo cars. He only can drive Playstation cars, he has no idea about boost and he should use the revs of his car
Ray didnt align in any of the rolling race nor in the brake test.....its was not the real results. Should have done again....like other races
Wooow, excelent, serios.
Porsche silent beast
I see real competition here men. Kudos..
Yanni was so pumped like he personally built and tuned the car..
That porsche driver...
Doesnt nick father own the TT?
So the guy who built the Porsche and drove it and came to represent the company and the car ended up trying to cheat in every way possible. don't ever invite him back. Idiot
And that's why you never buy a crappy Audi.Shit electrics.
One of the worst videos ever...such a shame!
Let the owners drive
You can tune the car but you can’t modify the driver. If he’s a waste man and dunno how to drive, there is no hope 🤦🏻‍♂️
Chingon
That Porsche driver cheated all the time.
Get llf rickys gtr and arthurs trrs
You will not beat the porsche!
The first car to get to hot loses. Everything
3:35 اهم شي القير اذا كان سريع فسيارتك سريعة  اذا كان بطئ فلايهم عدد الاحصنة مهما كثرت .
Ray what was that?
BRUHHHH. Lol that porches driver!!!?   Ban him from carwow 😂.
Does the Porsche driver not know what get even means!?  And he jumps early on one of the drag races.
Audi R8 with 1200 hp: I did 1/4 mile in 9.4 Rimac Nevara: That's cute
El R8 de ALFREDO VALENZUELA  😱😱😱
Those 5 cylinders tuned up to 1000bhp sounds absolutely absurd, also Jesus what a little rocket
5:18 - just for me or does the tt sound like the lamborghini sound?
Dude in the Porsche fucked up all them races, just to have to sit out the end cause the car got “too hot.”
Awesome!!!!!!👍👍👍
This is one if the best drag race on car wow
ray did over 50 every time lol, except with the braking, its like 3 (ray speeding up to get level) go! (ray already doing 70 cause he needed to catch up), also jumped at the drag...great car, but Ray can't drive for shite
great work 👏👏👏
Porshe needs some attention...
Who all wants a drag race between 1400hp Supra and a 1400hp skyline r34❤️❤️❤️
That Porsche is awesome but the driver is an absolute loser
Hi I'm mat Watson with another blant boring plug for VAG products.How boring I'm sorry.
Watching matt tryna get use to the car has to be one of the funniest things iv seen no cap loooooool nutttter
Mm could try traction 'off'
Man the porche cheats the whole time
80,000 in mods if your don’t know what your doing 😂😂😂 Then a car pulls up costing only 30k to own ya 😂
These cars are a joke! 😂
wtf these cars
Why was the Porsche even there? Never listened to any instructions and cheated to get an advantage in every test. Hung back for the brake test, accelerated early on the rolling to build boost and shot off early on the drag.
ES MOTOR😍
12:01 no words.
I felt the clutch material vaporizing during the edit of Yannis RPMs at 10:05.  Obligatory Porsche cheated
Love how everyone is bashing the Porsche driver just because he started a few car lengths back; he probably just wasn't paying attention to what Mat and Yanni were doing and was too enamored by 1100hp at his right foot. Come on guys; be better than that. He wouldn't cheat. The guy was up till 5 am tuning the damn thing; cut him some slack. I'd love to see any of you volunteer to drive that behemoth of a car and see how well you would do given you can run your mouth so much
The clueless in pursuit of the pointless.  9 times out of 10, an Avis hire car will beat the lot
Let him talk Yianni smh
But what were the 0-60 times?
That Porsche driver... If he worked on the car the way he drives...
Porsche driver is a cheater 😒
Shame the driver of the ES motors wasn’t playing ball. No need to doubt that car it would have won or a very close second anyway, no need to jump the starts so badly
Can't wait for Plaid S to outrun these.
Matthew got spanked by Yani
Loved this Matt and the team, I feel had the Porche been at optimal temps it would have won, but the other 2 are epic cars even with their flaws. More of this please!!!
Yianni stuck  to the windscreen , heart rate  gone bonkers , brilliant 👏👏😂
The TT RS just sounded like a really long fart
Best of 2021 yet 😍😍
I really love the Audi TT RS it's my favourite modern Audi and the RS3
Futty Yianni should go to school. Do not give him the car. What  a loser...
If the RPM act doesn't pick up momentum crazy to think Europe might be the land of horsepower to visit from the US
Dat blue Porsche is ah beast
Porsche driver is a grade-A CHOOCH
we want to see more tuned cars, but tuned supercars
Although rather different, this has to be one of my favourite carwow vids. It was too intense🤣🤣🤣
Do a Rolls-Royce drags 😭😭
Porsche driver cheated every time
Worst video I watched from you guys. The dude in the Porsche is super annoying.
There goes the carwow crown 👑 to Audi.
Yianni is my favorite rich person that I don't know.
Well done to ES for cheating on every, single, test, and ruining the whole thing. Do us a favour and don't ask them back.
Porche driver ruined video with his bullshit cheating. How difficult is it to get level and listen to the radio.  Great Job Yanni and Matt. Could see they were having fun 😂😂😁👍🏻
This was absolutely mental. I just loved every minute. The Porsche driver was boring and ruined some parts though. Love the joy i've noticed on Mat and Yanni's faces. Keep up the good work!
Porsche king 👌
I bet the Porsche guy realized he was going to lose against the R8 after Yianni figured out how to launch it properly and therefore didn't want another go. A bit sad really!
Try these tests with: No launch control No ESP or ASR Manual gearbox Preferably: 2WD  Else: leave out the drivers, and let the cars compete at their own, without driver.
Sf90 would've beat all of these
How many of you think matt was the happiest person in that race ?😃
Never have that Porche driver back there again lol.
Esmotor 🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷
ES MOTOR ftw
amg gt 4 door vs m8 competition vs new e63s vs m5 competition vs ABT RS7
Money well spent then.... 🤣🙈
Vaoooov
rimac still holds the carwow drag time record, probably wont be beaten
This was probably one of most fun drag races you guys had.
The tuned 911T isn't any quicker than a standard 911T then.. hmm
This proves that Yiann is a better driver then Matt and that ESmotors makes one of the fastest Porsches on the streets and as for the R8 😏 it’s an absolute bargain considering how lil work went into the car compared to the other 2
I thought it was arthurs car  or was that just a publicity stunt to get views
Was Bill Belichick behind the wheel of the porsche?!?
Bruh yianni always looks like hes strangling the steering wheel 🤣🤣🤣
This video was terrible. People like the dynamic between the 2 dudes...but keep Matt and get some real drivers.
Remember the tuned M5 and RS3 beating stock 911 Turbo S (last drag race of 2020)? I challenge you Mat to race them now with this tuned 911 Turbo and get the same result 😁
https://youtube.com/channel/UCofyLSMIdJZuPKm4xto7Gsw
Omg is that the intake  on the Audi?
It was insane 🤯 I was cringing the whole time in the video theeee best Big HP drag I have watch 🔥🔥❤️.
That blue tuned Porsche  ALL DAY EVERY DAY! I want to see how this blue Porsche stands up against that 1200hp M5.
IROZ MOTORSPORTS RS3!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
That was awesome but the guy in the porsche needs to understand the word level 🤣🤣
Crazy that the remac and roadster v2 will beat both of them with so much daily driver potential
Dude in Porsche and tune but not drive? Jesus Christ
I enjoy watching these videos because of Yanni. He should be in every video
Yanni's face, haha, so intense winning races. Love it !
Do the m5 1100hp v the r8 and the tt
the dude in the porsche is a cheat he got a run up on the drag races , when Mat says 1 he was prob doing 20km/h faster CHEATER
You realize... the Porsche did that on purpose..... he didn't care about fairness. lol He only wanted to ensure he won. Probably for his shop... lol
That R8 thoughhhhhhhhhhhhhh !!!
B6 S4 vs E46 M3
the 1200hp+ hydrogen fuel cell Zeon car will keep up with these, with reliability included
โคตรชอบแนวนี้มากเลย
R8 won Rolling race cause porchse cheated, porchse won break test and drag race winner was R8 2-1 over porchse sadly no TT wins
matts just excited to be alive after they start drag racing XD
Waste of time, none of them know what they are doing...
This race was awesome. Wow. That R8 was so fast it was Stupid :) Words of Yianni :)
Porsche driver seems a bit dim witted
Could you a drag race with a 2016 Cadillac CTS-V
Rematch
So the Porsche only gained .4 seconds for that much money and jeopardized reliability? That doesn’t make much sense.
I shit my pants just watching this
It should have just been Matt & Yianni… Porsche driver, what were you doing? You clearly don’t watch Carwow 😤
The Porsche guy would’ve outperformed the other cars if he played by the rules, but he decided to cheat anyways.
Nobody   Yani: Woaaaaahhh 😲
The Porsche driver could not stay level 😂
wtf up with the Porsche guy? stepping back each time. What, has he never seen carwow show and how the roll race is done and brake test is done?  rolling on from behind? not surprised. 90k for 1100hp LOL With  90k you could get a 2019-2020 Cayenne to put next to the turbo. Lastly, for the price of these kits none were reliable. What a pain in the a$$ . They didnt work half the time.
That porche is cheating
You need a 2.5T built by a real company like IROZ MOTORSPORT. Would’ve walked the others
Yani is happy that he wins but he always gets the better car but still loses sometimes lmao🤣🤣🤣
"Daddy porsche"  no matter when u read this
Crazy fun at Carwow! Keep bringing it guys! Thanks
Whats the point of tuning your car when its going to heat itself after just 2 races? BS.
So the lesson is: Tuned cars are temperamental...and Ray should not do these races.
8:04
Porsche driver and his cheating ruined this comparison fr
Bruh Yianni gotta chill he’s scaring me lol
Fukinell😲
Unpopular Opinion: Modified Cars really sound shitty, loud but shitty.
Lmfaooo looks like a ny street race
CHAOS, ABSOLUTE CHAOS IN THIS VIDEO....
Now this is what i call BEAST MODE
Yanni
The Porsche Driver cheated all the way. Building momentum in rolling races and lagging behind in the brake test.
That's the most hardcore M AMG RS NISMO etc. version of Yianni
The porsche cheated
As a porsche fanboy im usually happy when porsche wins. not today.
Hey Matt! Big fan of your drag racing. Why don't you do hypercar drag! Personally I'd love to watch that kind of racing! Is there any plan for it?
Ray didn't even level on any point 😕. Cheated
Porsche driver trying every possible trick to cheat and win, no wonder he was up till 5am working in his strategy
Loved this video Matt.
Would love to watch the Ariel atom in a race
Jesus Christ would ya let the lads who develop the cars drive the flippin things.
All 3 sub 10 seconds... That's seriously quick on an air base run way
If there's an R8 I already know Yianni is inside
Probably the scariest race they have ever had....imagine being so focused on the car not killing you that you forget that you are racing other people. Mat literally saw at the end that they were left behind and couldn't check if they were level....that's standard procedure on a Carwow Drag Race.
Rather have a reliable mildly tuned then extremely tuned and get embarrassed when it’s time to race….
Porsche driver is a cheating pleb, don't invite him back on
Porsche driver fucked this whole video up
Whoever was driving that Porsche... please don’t invite him to any other future drag races.    If he can’t follow the rules and get level with everyone else for the challenges he does not deserve to be in the videos in the first place.  I could have driven that car more properly than him, because I know the meaning of “get level with me”.  Pathetic cheater
The guy in the Porsche cheated multiple times…otherwise a very interesting and fun video as always!
soooo what we learned in this video, just buy porsche and beat everyone😂
Best drag race of this channel ever?
Ray cheated the whole day 😂😂
The best drag race of 2021 !
That was very bad.
how funny is the mat testing his car , meanwhile yianny talking to the other guy how to change into manual mode 🤣
Should let the owners drive their own cars as they know how to drive them properly
Porsche 911 is in another level
Porsche driver cheated every time he could.
I’ll have the 911 please.
Remember the guy from Tokyo Drift, the one with one eyed grandmother?  That lady could drive better than Porsche's driver.
And with this highly tuned cars makes a 992 Turbo S looking slow😆
Dude that TTRS sounds INSANE. Looks scary too...
Ray has got NO IDEA what "level" means. Is he a flat-earther?
Never seen Yianni sit that far forward. He looked shook
Basically all 3 cars have very unreliable tuning.
I told ya'll 😏get a 911 turbo S that's tuned... It will change the game 😄🔥🔥🔥💯
The automatic captions say [Music] during the race and I agree with it.
Fire the Porsche driver
Porsche's should be made in Switzerland..the never fail even when you tune them..
There is no way a heavily tuned 1100hp 911 Turbo will do 9.7 when a stock one does 10.1.  No way, especially after witnessing how it destroyed the two audis in the rolling race. Whole race was very chaotic, and we want a rematch! Who's with me?
Cant believe Porsche oem its 10.1 or so.. And with 1100hp 9.7? No way hahaha very good race anyway
Golf r Vs mercedes g63
That was a really dramatic video. Only because everything went wrong
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣👍
nothing sound better than a 5 cylinder on boost
VAG💪💪💪💪💪
We’re having lots and lots of fast cars this month and and when mat says: 0:53 we also are going to die of that insane preformance
Not a good way to advertise your business when you cheat on every single race
New video of carwow, ok firts like and then view xd
This is the most chaotic carwow race ever! #phew, that was hectic.
The 911 turbo he cheated the hole time
Ray is an Idioit, damn
Porsche 911 turbo s vs chevy ZR1.   Like pls..
TTRS best sounding!
The Porsche is cheating in every race even the drag race !! hahahahha
just let the owners drive
Yaaah! Yianni got a perfect feel for that R8. TT was wicked.
I think am in love with the lady that's counting down, her voice is so satisfying
Yanni always has the most intense face.
u should leave the owner’s test their car’s!
The crazy thing is that these are all slower than the Model S Plaid.
That dude in the Porsche smh
need to see an IMS1400 car on carwow. rs3 that runs 7s
Videos was great you keep it real
Who TF was driving that Porsche, Mat’s Mum?
Waooo bendiciones desde
Porsche: I'm gonna start 4 car lengths back and cheat by accelerating before
A R8 with Turbo iss sick
i think everyone in the comment is talking about how the Porsche is at an advantage
5 cylinder best sound ever
The Porsche always cheating and don't get level 😂😂
10:43 who are those alpha looking men? muslims?
What's the point of upgrading your car to make it faster and then it doesn't even go, this is not the first time a tuned car does this
This video shows why EVs are the future. Every single one of these cars is basically unreliable garbage.  Meanwhile the Model S plaid could destroy all of these with no issues every single time.
whys that guy find it so hard to be level
legends say the porsche driver is still trying to level with the two audis…
Not sure the Porker got equal screen time...
Subilo a carwow america latina
So powerful for a TT 🤣🤣
The Porsche very disappointed👎
i hope the porsche driver sees how much we hate him
Insane power on these cars. The TTRS and R8 are insanely fast.  Tjeeeer
«  i think I made a mess in my pants «  - Matt 😭
Dont know who Yanni is but please keep him in this series he a legend.
This is the most fun drag race on carwow
That Porsche is fast even though it's heavy
Where's the tuned bmw M5 🤨 missing that one now
I love these comments just flaming the Porsche driver
The most beautiful sounds
the bloke with the porsche is such a cheat...starting behind pressing gas earlier staying behind on brake test and also braking earlier....
Lol this is why matt never does tuned cars drag races
typical Porsche owner
The secret of your future is hidden in your day routine . Successful people do daily what unsuccessful people do occasionally
Thats damn shame that the Mclaren 765 would be able to keep up with those tuned monsters
Porsche cheated
you deserve 10mln subs
Not doubting the Porsche was cheating every race but let’s be honest even heads up the Porsche would’ve gapped em
volkswagen cars racing
This Drag Race is INSANE
shitty tuned cars :/ the porsche is the worst tuned for me, stock it destroyed everything, so tuned it should be far better than it is now
Looking forward to never seeing that Porsche driver in another video, what a clown
We need to fire the Porsche driver
You guys suck only meant to test stock cars...cant drive hi hp cars at all lmao
Sorry but Ray can't drive for shit
yanie go block
" where is my Bloody walkie talkie!?" 😆😆😆
Matt if you do multiple runs on the dragrace why don't you pick the best times per car instead of per race? Looked like the TT RS did a better time in one of your first runs🤔  Loved the video those cars were beautifull
Want to see a tuned BMW 540 (stage 2 or 3) vs a 550 or M5
4:37 that 911 kick down so good ❤
I'm always wondering about the gas mileage of such highly tuned cars Does anyone have a good guess how much they use?
mejor del mundo Audi R8 vamos!!!!!!
TT needs anti lag
although this video was already entertaining, it's quite sad that the porsche driver ruined the video. would have been much better video with an actual driver for more accurate results
Porsche driver kinda "ruined" the video
Driver ist badddd diskike
The R8
ngl this is the most sketchy video on this channel yet
porch cheating in brake test
That Porsche Driver ruined the comp 😂
TTs a sleeper
ive already got a stage2 ttrs (~440bhp) and that is unreasonably quick for the road... i dont want to imagine how an 1100bhp ttrs behaves on the road...
Cracking video but please please car wow can show us the terminal speeds on the drag races as well as the times 🙏
Thats why cars like that are pointless, they are broken 90% of the time
Most entertaining video yet
OMG!! This video was all over the place. Absolute madness. #anxietyattack
Porsche driver is a cheat.
I haven't watched yet but I know the 9/11 wins
In 10 years this is history. Watching electric cars doing a dragrace is no fun at all…..
Awesome video mate I love it 😍😍😍
The depressed bugle logistically battle because hour dimensionally hop forenenst a capricious flock. supreme, spicy canvas
Really expected that TT to break. The TT sounded the best. Great David vs Goliath video
Increible el grupo vw!
Broo that tt sounds like a V10
Being a flat 6 engine Porsche is a silent killer💙 Not like others Just sounds but not working  This is the reasone More price of Porsche
Girl: Your like a brother to me The poor guy: 8:3
Haha when the boost came on at 100 mph in the tt 😂😂😂
You guys need to do the races properly maybe get someone else to drive the porsche, get someone who knows how to be leveled
As crazy as they are when they get going, I think I'd just stick with a stock car over modded. Seems like every race with a modded car something goes wrong.
I was expecting a brawl between the tuning companies or something 🤣😭🎆
And all 3 would have been beaten by a stock (cheaper) Tesla Model S Plaid… *stands back waiting for the comments 🤣
Hectic
M5 and M8 anyday
truly stunning to see such hardcore cars
SMH tuned cars, bit of a shambles but couldn't stop watching 😅
What a race 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
banger of a race
Matt was racing along lol 😂 😂 😂
what the hell is that Porsche driver doing?
All that cheating and the 911 didn't win bahahaha 🙈🙈
Yainny loves that tt
the porsche driver was so desperate
Does the man in the blue car have an eye and hearing problem???🤨🤔🤦🏾‍♂️
Vs tuned Bentley w12!!!!
That R8 was amazing!
Porsche would have won if it had a proper run
Porshe won 🏆
At the rolling race the porsche just slayed them all.. Porsche started from behind and passed them 🤐😨 Well done @ESMOTOR good job !! 👍🏼👍🏼
Disappointed there was no honk test.
Porsche driver literally cheated in ever race even the fucking brake test
7:52
good job on handling the porsche driver, the video was still good with tt vs r8
porsche driver was cheeating in every chellenge soo yeah
So is the R8 officially the fastest car on carwow?
Very raw , I loved it !
this is soooo chaotic lmao
How do you not know you have to be in boost rpm range on a roll race….talking about the hole….needs a driver mod.
the porsche driver doesnt understand english
HIGHLY Disappointed aboutthe Porsche driver !!!  NOT a fair comparison! He CHEATED in every way he could by knowing the rules and ignoring Matt.   - Is it the brake test  (where he reached 60mph  but is way behind the others, he could gain speed  brake till reached 60  than do the full stop)  - nor the rolling drag   (when he is earlier on boost  and on go  he flew away).   Thats not a good advertisement for es-motors 991,   the driver probably worked hard till 5am   to develop a cheat strategy on the later finding carwow race  :D  Matt  wait next time till everone is on a straight line,  otherwise the comparison makes no sense and should repeat it!!
Remac vs Porsche 😉
The Porsche driver SUCKS
80 grand spent on the Porsche for.5 seconds faster lol
2:58 Yiani doing the motion of rolling his already rolled sleeves 🤣
911 guy cheated on the rolling races and brake test
1000HP tunes that keep blowing up eating the gearboxes
I mean sure guy in Porsche messed up those rolls but damn you did him dirty, not only by calling him out but also why not just wait a sec so he can get there? In the first race you saw him behind and thought "guess he will be level in one second"?
The dude driving the Porsche is an absolute idiot when it comes to following instructions. Why is it so difficult to just listen and cooperate? Failed at the sound test, failed at getting levelled, failed at even launching the car at go…what’s fucking wrong with him? He shouldn’t even be the driver in the first place…he ruined everything butthole!
That guy Ray in the Porsche..... was it Ray Charles by any chance? 🥴
The porsche driver SUCKS!!!! please dont have him back on
yanni is so funny!!!   hahaha
These guys are at it again and again
This is why manufacturers make their cars as they do. Not lack of skills: they just know where the limits are. What a mess.
Does the guy in the Porsche knows the rule, messing around …
Why do you pay so much money for a modification that not work properly with the gearbox and software. The amount of times you needed to do a drag race it's a joke. Ray loves to cheat. Go to HGP and resolve the problem.
I'm never modifying my car to the extreme lol
3,400hp in a three car drag race 👁👄👁
Gawd dayyyuuuuuummm, this drag race is only for the Highly “TUNED CARS.”  Honestly the Porsche 911 won the race flat out. That car is a Missile. L🤣L!!!
If that is what Ray thinks level means he probably shouldn't build his own shed. 😁
Shows that you can run n run the Audi not like the Porsche lolweak
Matt get DMODEEJAY
that audi r8 is to fast
Top Race!!
And that's why modifying cars too much is daft. :)
This race was trash
What the heck is the Porsche driver doing???  🤦🏽‍♂️. We never get to see a TUNED turbo and when we do this is the result
That bmw m5 1000hp should be there also
Ray is a cheater!!! lol
A 9.4 second quarter mile is ridiculous fast!!!
Been following the TTRS build for over a year now. That thing is the definition of a sleeper. Nick and his dad are proper Madlads. IYKYK
Expensive and highyly modified cars that don't even deliver the way you want them. Sometimes they do that in stock too. What a disappointment
That Ray guy in the 911 is a sneaky cheater. Im surprised no one on the crew called him out on it. That Porsche is crazy nonetheless!
Isnt the audi tt a total underdog even with the extreme tune...
Would have been a way better video with the actual owners of the cars driving it properly these guys can’t drive for shit 😂😂😂😂😂
1 0 to me Yiannie 😂😂😂😂
Cheating Porsche!!!  Holy crap that guy cheated on every single race.  Both rolling races he was way back then was already accelerating past Matt and Yani on go.  Then the braking test he fell back and started breaking before the line.  Then the drag race for some convenient reason his car was overheating when Yani got the R8 figured.  Great episode but that Porsche driver was a joke!
1 0 to me Yiannie 😂😂😂😂
1200 hp M5 Cs ? I cant imagine
The tt is insane considering it’s not a sports car like the others
So fun, awesome cars
We just wanted a proper, clear drag race..
Русс есть
The Porsche driver cheated in the rolling races and brake test by the looks of it. He wasn't level at 50mph...he was probably doing 60 by the time you were level.
What on earth is that Porsche driver playing at in all these tests? Is he that afraid of making his car look bad? Show us what it can do fairly against the others.
I go to this channel for comic relief.
That Porsche driver ruined the whole thing! Get that guy out of there!!
The TTRS was the most exciting car
1000+hp GTR vs 1000+hp supra🧐
The screen with all the data is something you should continue.
Do a 335i race
Wht do you let the porshe cheat? I love porsche and wanted him to win,but not anymore Fucking cheater
The fact that the TT and the R8 are so close speaks volumes…
pls do tuned car races pls they are awsome to watch
The Porsche drive is an idiot, how do he fail to stay level every damn time?
Best video ever
Porsche driver was the worst ever on the channel💀
Porque ni subes video tan interesantes como estos a el canal de carwow Americalatina
The Porsche driver is soo amateur, he is breaking early, he is not leveled up while the rolling race 🔥
Porsche driver is a punk
And the result is (as was to be expected)...:   Tuning cars are horse shit!
Ray can't understand level.
Matt, I've been watching carwow since it only had 80 thousand subscribers, and look where it is now. The contents keep on getting better and better each time, as for example look at this particular video, what an extraordinary video i must say. I will keep supporting such awesome channel!!!
Why do we have to put up with this Yanni fellow? Is he the owner of carwow? He's just an asshole...!!
Yesss! More heavyweight bouts like this!!💪🏾💪🏾
Porsche driver cheated!!!!
TTrs sounds like a v10 those 5 cylinder engines 👌🏽
The most time they re-remached
Get level doesn’t seem to ring everyone’s bells 🙄😂
U forgot to say audi r8 is the king of carwow drag races and bmw fan boys got dropped lol
That Porsche driver keeps cheating
Line them up with a 1000hp 720S or 765LT. The M840T engine seems to make peak torque/power across a way wider range.
this is for sure was one interesting race
Amazing and crazy race guys 🤪🤩. I love the way how you compete, please continue and have fun 👏😂
Lol so they would all be blown into the weeds by a Tesla Model S Plaid lol.  Qtr mile in 8.6Sec.
The TT is terrifying! I want one. The sounds and the performance 🤯
Great. Thanks from Germany.
9 sec gangs 😂
😈💪🏻
Yanni Boy well done mate , love it , new you do it
Pls CarWow McLaren P1Vs 670 Vs 720S
I really want to see  1000hp+ tuned Mercedes vs BMW vs Audi and then throw in a stock Porsche 911 or something for a base line to reference.
Porsche would be even faster without that (Any) driver!
Uwwww gad jamet
Like I say every time I see the 911… Porsche all day. Every day !!! (I love all cars though)
These are the Big daddy's of uk 😂😂
Loved how excited Yianni was in this one. Like a kid at christmas
The Porsche driver is weak. Doesn't know how to do a "level" rolling start, and went with the excuse of "too hot" to avoid the last race. I should be driving that car for proper drag races.
What’s better R8 or an aventador?
With all due respect, Yannick should never get the chance to catch an Audi R8 he gon spoil its legacy. With regards
Tuned cars not good original much better
That TTRS sounds insane 🤩😍
Mat was racing his shadow 😂😂
Audi TT(tok*t) RS 😆
Mat will be having this fun laugh 😂😂😂  kkkkk you make me come back to this channel every day I love you guys keep on
Insane weapons
One of the nicest videos in a while!  How about a review for the HONDA CIVIC 2022
Intense
9.4 sec 1/4 m omg 😳😳😳
hate this race, that Porshe makes everything bad. Nothing counts
Ray can never get leveled
Best video yet. Mental !!
Why can I never take Yani seriously? Idk of its his face or what 🤣
I would have loved to see the 1000hp BMW M5 in this race ‼️‼️
Fuel be like: " bYe HaVe A gReAt TiMe ✌
Adding a Turbo into a bloody beautiful V10 engine. This is what I call complete fck up.
Sorry but all that money can't buy a reliable car fast yes but can't even get off the line 🤣
rip matt👻
day one of waiting for a tesla model s plaid review
Has the porsche driver ever driven a car before? Seemed incapable of doing anything right other than chatting shit at the start...
That porsche driver wtf seriously... cheated in every single one. Had to be on purpose
the cars were probably the best  but the video showed a lot of unnecessary stuffs I hope you understand, but still, the video was good
Spoiler: The VW wins
The driver of the porsche fucked something up every single challenge wtf :DDD
when comes the buggati vs koenigsegg video??
Matt great video with Yianni and Ray, however could do a video  with the Bentley Continental GT v Aston Martin AMR DB11 GT v Ferrari Roma GT v Mercedes GT 4?
Sf90 vs m5 evolve ,,like if u with me
The ill climb conceptually glue because fender disconcertingly appear at a orange command. powerful, present recorder
DO SUPERCARS!!!!!!
something about lesser cylinder with fast revving engine makes me turned
The owner of the Porsche 911 must of been like, alright enough no more racing before this expensive thing ends up breaking 😂
What that Porsche needs is a driver mod...
Who’s the person with a death wish that but 1100 hp in a TT
That’s blue Porsche driver was Useless from courage the cowardly dog 🐶 lmao 😂     Line up they tell the person, meanwhile the guy building boost in the back and taking off earlier then everyone or during the brake test he was like 2 cars behind and braking lmao 😂  Awesome cars👌👍👍👍 Awesome Race 👌👍👍👍
That face of Matt when it kicked down 😂😂
Right so what I did, was not pay attention to the Porsche since the driver didn’t show how fast it actually is in the rolling race. Wish I could pay attention but he’s so bad LMAO.
Thought the Audi TT was Arthur's car.... Nick's dad 🤨🤔
The far hook informally obtain because raft particularly scratch modulo a loose department. infamous, bizarre error
People who wished to see a tuned 911 YES, at last . . I'm one of those people 😂
Yianni’s facial expression be funny as fuck
Yianni aggressively shifting gears is pure gamer energy
Guys, are u taking the piss??? This episode is all over the place!! Not what we got used to from you. Very very botched episode this. Do better.
OMG
Just brilliant ...more of this
You guys should do a drone shot for drag  races at the finish line to get a better view .....
These cars are epics.  Its like totally beast need to be tamed . Best ever in this channel!
Yianni was so aggressive man
That TT Sounds Like I wanted to my car ❤️
At 6:21 the 911 breaking the sound barrier
Hilarious!
what a mess 😂 every car was all over the fucking place
That much of power but still a bit below 10 seconds for a quarter mile
Ray in the Porsche is a big cheat. Holds back then accelerates early so is on boost on the rolling drags then brakes way early on brake test. 🤣
So what's the point of tune the cars? More time in garage than on track. Better non tune car and some classic in garage to work on
Don’t ever let that Porsche driver back again. He was cheating the entire time. I’m thinking he just wanted to make it look like his car was the best so his company got more business. We’re not stupid we can see exactly what you’re doing and you suck.
The Porsche Win um my opinion. Of course.
Who is that 'Ray' guy and was he sleeping or something?
The Porsche driver was scared to loose and make his company look bad in front of millions of people on YouTube, reason why he cheated. If you think that the Porche driver would of still won regardless of cheating or not “you are wrong” let’s keep it plain and simple. According to the facts/numbers below from their 1/4 mile race numbers.   R8: 9.4s TTRS:  9.9s Porsche: 9.7s  Facts are facts you can’t change that at this time which makes it clear the porche still would of lost. So plain and simple Porche driver cheated to get the win on the rolling races. He started way behind to increase speed and catch up to the others drivers at a higher speed for the starting line.
Please do more motorcycle races for the bike fans
I really, really enjoyed this video!!!
Porsche driver was so excited (or exhausted) that he couldn't even pay attention. Shame really, such a beautiful car.
Интересный был заезд, очень напряжённый  👍😬
Be good too get a Kawasaki H2R in there too see what what would happen....
With great power comes greater bills
That guy in the Porsche should only be allowed to wash the cars!!
Give the guy in the Porsche a brake. If Mat and Yianni didn't need 100 tries to get going, the Porsche would not have over heatet. The Porsche was clearly the faster car today.
Please do more of these tuned car episodes
TTRS sounds like a group B Audi rally car.  Incredible!
Ray is shit at this brake test was a biased
Conclusion: audi r8 winner
The Porsch driver is a huge cheat.....he hung back on the rolling races and then put his foot down before the Mat said go.......I don't get it the Porsch had a good chance of winning anyway.....
This video gonna Hit 20M+
Porsche driver is hot garbage
Mr Porsche man, you cheating. Taking a run up on the rolling races. Lagging behind on the brake test and jumping the start on the first drag race... when you car was still working. Other wise this post was very entertaining....could feel Yianni's excitement.
The 911 driver was pretty much just doing his own thing this entire episode haha
The guy in the 911 was horrible.  Early breaking, never level,  jumped the start  lol
Matt was in his own little happy world for most of this🤣
Subtitle Indonesia please
I was expecting Nick's dad Arthur 😕, hope he's ok.
putz, vocês não sabem dirigir, parecem amadores.
Without watching, ill always choose the TTrs
Ray seems like a tool
Don’t bring  the Porsche driver back.
Ngl, any carwow drag race that involves highly tuned cars is never organized.
Belle.
Epic
That porsche was a problem the entire race
next ep Twin turbo lambo ?
Can we get an Ariel atom on the show please 😩💯💯💯💯💯
The Porsche guys sucks... He is never level and when mat counts he is already passing them with way more boost. And he did jumped the drag race
I loved this race 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
You need to do this again with all 3 starting with no issues
I love it !
In the Age of Plaid this just seems laughable
Bro stop these tuned cars drag races ....... it's just stupid
Please Matt....never invite Ray to participate in the CarWow program again.
This TT RS might be the worst tuned car ever
Thoughts before the race: With all these hp I expect to see a quarter mile in the area of 9.2 seconds. Of course it will be a walk in the park for the Porsche. After the race: The sound of the TTRS is epic! Opera. In the only race the Porsche completed it won. I am not sure if 9.7 was its best time.
What’s wrong with the dude in the Porsche??? Dude made this video unbearable to watch
Este video en latino porfavor 🙏 😭
This is the most annoying episode I've seen of CarWow all because of the $%#@ driver Ray in the Porche
Yianni: chilling Matt: I'm gonna fucking fly
I think the TT needs a better map🤔
That was wicked
Man those porsches are just nasty
Porsche driver sucks!!!
Ray was either trying to cheat the races or just a really bad driver.  Spend 80k on a engine but have terrible brakes?  TT owner was just doing the engine for bragging rights and not a true racer.
This is what we needed to see..  the TT tho.. R8 🚀
That TT looks dangerous lol
Es motor mükemmel ya
Can you do a hellcat srt redeye
They filmed this race like 9 months ago 👀
The reason I love Yianni soooo much is because his facial expression are bloody engaging in the race every single time just like mine, overloaded...😜
I love how they put down their power well
Although these cars seem quite insane, am I the only one who thinks they are useless? You have some perfect built machines from the factory after companies spent years for their evolution and development and then decide to double or triple their horsepower just to make them go fast in a straight line. You ruin their reliability, setup, cornering, balance, while having spent tenths of thousands for that. The Porsche driver declined having another race (probably the engine could not handle a third launch?) and that is a fair example of how a masterpiece of engineering, speed, acceleration, reliability etc like a Turbo S, is now just a "rice" car for drag races. The TT's engine got tweaked to 1,100 bhp but the owner could not bother upgrading to suitable brakes for such amount of power.  Pretty impressive all this, but on the back of my head I feel sorry for these cars.
No one is talking about the porsche!  It's on a league of its own 😂😂😂
the 911 turbo it's insane fast!!!
Yanni all audis lost power if start without lauch control
So. Tesla plaid wins with four doors.
First carwow video I disliked. Only because of the the cheater in the Porsche. I'm willing to unsubscribe to the channel if that cheating driver is in any future videos and conducts himself in the same manner!!  1. You can clearly see him let off the accelerator before the line in the brake test. 2. What does the phrase "get level" mean? 3. Bring back the driver u usually race against when Yanny isn't there. Atleast he's a fair driver who doesn't cheat!!
the 5 cylinder of the TTRS doesnt even sound like 5 cylinder anymore... more like raspy v10 :D
Underground Huracan vs CIcio GTR
The R8 was the best bang for the buck. £40k for a 9.2 second 1/4 mile! And that's with a 'soft' launch!
Yanni is such a drama queen,...ha,...I love it!  Actually,...so is Matt.
Don’t ever invite the Porshe driver again.
Proch won sound test
Porsche cheating :) two times start with full boostin puling
Brilliant
Mehn I love the Porsche. The car just blasted off immediately. I doubt if the Audi will beat the Porsche. I reckon the Porsche will beat the Audi. I can bet on it $500.
Most ever horsepower ever, in a carwow drag-race.
at the end that audi looked bloody terrifying fastest car there easily
bruh porsche driver just putting the porsche in boost by staying behind. mans a cheat
All the Germans.
It would be nice to have a timer everytime the cars launched so we could see the times they did. Since you know, a draft race is all about  that time.
WTF !! How a 2.5 L 4 cylinder engine can produce 1000 hp ?
Porsche driver 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
The porshe driver was such a cheater
11:55 that face though….
⚠️This video proofs that you should not tune your car.⚠️
Mat u should get the 1000hp bmw vs a 1000hp supra
These crazy performances videos r my fave by far cause of all the  crazy stuff that can happen
Does it feel boring after the Nevera?
Now, those 3 against the Rimac Nevera and Model S Plaid.
Those cars are so modified they are all rubbish. Way too temperamental
That r8 is a deal!!
Matt would you be so kind to say 'now!' a tiny bit later next time? Now you made me look at your face and that didn't get me anywhere
Get other guests dude, change it up, Yianni is getting boring
4:44 that turbo lag was just...
So what exactly happened? 🤣🤣
Lmao, i love how Yanni takes these so seriously. Just look at those facial expressions when shifting
Man that was a hell of a dragrace! Can you please repeat it this time the Porsche included
I'd take the R8 or the Porsche for sure!!
Audi👑
I enjoy carwow videos… but this one was an AWESOME ONE!!! Keep doing these kind of videos please!!
Petrol power so much more entertaining than the washing machine cars
1st: Audi R8 - 9.4s 2nd: Porshe 911 - 9.7s 3rd: Audi TTRS - 9.9s . What amazing race! 👍
I wish he'd put the 0-60 times up.
Porsche porsche
You spend crazy money on them to make them useless
*Use me as a dislike button for the Porsche driver*
Great video!
The Porsche driver is trash.
Yanni: YAAAAAAAHHHHHHRRRRRRR 😂
Tge porsche guy cheated every race😂😂😂 and when he knew he wouldnt win he didn't race hahaha
The best drag race ever
This was the worst one ever 🤦🏽‍♂️
Shows that performance enhancement is  diminishing value
So stupid Porsche driver
I'm pretty sure, the Porsche driver has no control over his legs.
Basically stock cars are still best
R8 is my fav
Never tune ur car ! :D
TT unfortunately was not impressive
1,100hp and 1,000nm Audi TTRS vs 1,200hp 1,050nm Audi R8 vs 1,100hp and 1,200nm Porsche 911
these cars are faster than my Internet connection
The Porsche wasn’t level and how did it win the brake test😒😒
Too many screaming in a disorganized video!  Is it a review or just a funny prank?
One of my favorite videos
Ser de león no te lo imaginas
£123K for a old TTRS, im dead
F&F in real
Owner tells Matt the "brakes might be a bit sketchy." Me: Really looking forward to the brake test after hearing that. 🤣
Why pay to watch fast and furious when you got better here
My word, the guy driving that Porshe is dumber than a bag of hammers. Even my Mrs could keep a car level with others.
Best drag race ever .
That Porsche needed a proper driver though.
That porsche at rolling is mental
This gives me a little bit of topgear that i miss dearly
Porsche guy is a Pussio
The guy in Porsche is trolling in every race isn't correct at nothing
Hola would you like to race my E30 Turbo Touring ?? With nitrous it's got around 575 BHP  CHEERS AND KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK
9.4 has to be the quickest time ever on Carwow? Untill the Rimac Navara and the Model S Plaid comes along 😁
Bog standard .2 turbo s next time.
Buy a Rimac...
RaceLine makes carbon ceramic front brake rotors and ten piston calipers for the Audi TT RS.  It lightens up the front unsprung weight by almost 100 lbs.  it’s what I put on mine to stop it after my engine mods
Stock 911 can do 10.1s. 1100hp only 9.7s. Whats the point if your tires and gearbox cant handle all that power?
I changed my mind.Tuned Germans are better than JDM
Porscheeee gang forevaaa
Will we ever seee a Bugatti race
Talk too much shit at the start
On the Rolling race vtec kicked in for the tt rs after 95moh it just shit off omg
Where is Hank Iroz when you need him?
Yanni and the Porsche need new hobbies. Yanni you suck at driving
This is the most entertaining video I’ve watched on carwow so far :))) love it!
We need supercharged B8 Audi S4 v turbocharged B9 Audi S4 soon!
These tuned cars ALLWAYS breaks or doesn’t work. I’ll never go down that road …
Yainni Legend
Is there really a need to tune such cars?
TT RS all day long🏆
Still the 1000 hp M5 was more impressive to me. The Bimmer engine, gearbox, clutch  handled this much of horses and torque lot better than audi
This was such a below average episode!!! Not the quality of a normal Carwow. Sorry guys
Get a 1200 hp supra
Typical drag race... rerun until Yanni wins
I think this might've been the most boring carwow video I've watched
Fun fakt...the Porsche isn't tuned!😉
Porsche.  Not Porsh.
All that dough and these companys cant get  clean runs out of the cars lol
I think Ray was trying to cheat in the rolling race and the brake test or doesn’t know how to drive. 😆
The Porsche driver is the biggest cheat, disgraceful. Purposely not staying leveled and starting sending it before Matt even reach “1” on the countdown.
can u race some tuned suv"s
The Porsche is fast but he keeps cheating a little so I’m not sure which is actually better😂
This is the exact content we WANT..
Imagine taking the 911 to 1100 hp and putting almost 100k into it for it do to a 1/4 mile 0.4 seconds faster than a stock 911 turbo s
4:47 when vtec kick in yo xDDDDDDD
Imagine spending all that money on a Porsche that can’t launch more then 2 times. Pretty trash. 1100 horsepower that can’t be used when you want it. Keep it stock.
Stock Porsche 911 Turbo S - 10.1 Seconds Modified Audi R8 with 1000hp - 9.4 seconds   Hmmmmmmmmmm interesting
What abt 1200hp 600LT?❤️🔥
Wow ..I would like to see the Evolve cars in this race...the Evolve M5...
The frustration is real!
Its about the faster car Mat...its not about the driver...and we expect a fair game among the drivers. So it is Ok if you lose...cheer up mate... Well done Yanni.
emre abim ortaligi parcalamis
Porsche guy deserves a ballon d'or for cheating😂
Es motor demek Türkler belli edin kendinizi :D bi ben yokumdur inş
We won't old drag race, this is a shit
Impressive to think, the model S plaid beats all of these and costs less.
Hmmmm.... kind of an annoying video
Legends for Brazil Please Bro
This is a proof that when you buy a powerful car, you should leave it alone.
I enjoy the violence in the videos 😉😃
WOWCARS!
Best video ever, such a bonkers! And my favourite guest Yianni, brilliant ...
9.4 secs to 1/4 mile is mental
The ABsolute Best of all the amazing videos so far, luv how Yanni always brings his best performance... HALA guys thank you for the awesomeness
That R8 is the shit wow amazing cars all 3
The Porsche driver is a perfect example of a numpty that has far more money than driving talent. It was cringeworthy and embarrassing watching him screw up everything, my 15 year old lad could drive better than him.
TTRS Is my pick even with the Porsche being faster.
I bet the new 911 turbo S with a stage 1 tune is as fast as those overtuned cars on the 1/4 miles and it is somewhat reliable.
TT should be doing far better times than 9.9  There’s tt with 730bhp doing 9.5 and there 400bhp less
These tuned cars always mess up😂
The turbo s is just unbelievable
Volkswagen wins
まっすぐだけが速くてもね。英国人はこの手のやつが好きなんだろうね。
Aayansh got a few minutes walk from the airport and the other side of the year
Model S Plaid has entered the chat!
Please do more like this: tuned cars are fuckin mental
So you need over 1000bhp to do 1/4 mile a 0,6 seconds faster than stock 2021 911 Turbo S. This just shows how perfect is the new Turbo S guys and how it can put down all of its power.
Ray can't drive lol at all then he jumped every time on 2 at the rolling race 🤣 and yannis face had me dying when the r8 didn't work at all off the line😂😂😂😂this was too funny do another race like this again so funny
Yanni was pumped 😂
Hi
Hi
That's Porsche driver, missing his PlayStation. WTF mate 🤷🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
Whoever was in the Porsche, let us Porsche 911 owners and enthusiasts down. That was trassssh
Why did the Porsche driver think no one would notice he cheated every time? 😂 there’s a million camera angles lol
All I saw was a TT RS vs an R8.
If the message at the end stays, I would finally subscribe.  I never wanted to subscribe, because even if I would have subscribed, I would have to see that annoying "ad" in every video.  You always get a thumbs up and most likely a comment. Thanks for the video!
Race that R8 against 1000hp bmw m5
10:13
Yanni is the main star of the show lest be honest here XDDD
the fucks wrong with Ray???
Literally everyone is dissing at the porsche driver and he totally deserves it.
Whats wrong with that Porsche Driver? Can't stay level at all...
*Porsche Driver =* 🥴🥴🥴🥴🥴🥴🥴
That PORSCHE driver is a lil slow in thee head but his car is fast AF 🏁
So a standard porsche does 1/4 mile in 10.1 seconds with 638bhp I think, but an 1100 bhp does it in 9.7 seconds, something not right with someone's figures me thinks
No..! No.no,no,nonono..!!😂!
Yo wtf is wrong with the Porsche driver... Dude can't do anything right.
Yiani break all the cars that he gets on, jajajaja
Next Drag Watson must try that 991.2 (1100hp) and R8 (1200hp) watson is god of launch a car and that Gonna demolished the Nevera 😎😎😎
Astonishing machines
The Porsche driver is so annoyingly bad
Like hearing ya describe the cars, youre jobs easy enough, no need for the lazy descriptions
Tesla Model S Plaid A 4 Door Sedan Is As Quick If Not Quicker Than A Tuned Audi R8 Supercar With 1200Hp, What A World We Live In. LoL
Random question but can anyone tell what Yianni’s accent is compared to Mats? Are they both London but different parts?
It's amazing,  a guy with a successful YouTube channel can't actually drive for shit.
the guy in the 911 is a clown.
The Porsche driver is probably the worst one to ever come on carwow
Man that TT is something else
R8 all day 🦍
First time I have ever disliked a carwow video thanks to the Porsche driver
Porsche driver cheated in all tests
Ni a clases llego tan rapido😎🔥🇨🇱
plz do that porsche or r8 vs bmw m5 1000hp
Porsche Driver; doesn't line up right, doesn't start right; sees the R8 coming alive and is like nope I'm done for the day. What a pussy.
Like Ken Miles said. More of that!!!!!!
Madan car😎😎😎
ES motora selam olshn
Lol the 2nd rolling race the porsche was like 10 meters behind but still smoked the R8 and the TT
Please don’t let whoever was driving that Porsche to drive on this channel ever again, haha.  The worst.
That porche is a launch rocket. All 3 cars make me feel like swearing. Loved them all
Wow didn't expect the R8 to win...
Porsche guy get level = il do a flyby
Leave the launch control off dumdums
Mat if you could pull off getting an IROZ built TTRS and an Underground Racing R8, that would be proper as those are the top tuners for those cars respectively
I want to know if it's the same car produce the same horsepower, which tuning companies that can put it under the tarmac more effectively.
I love how yianni only cares abt beating Matt 🤣🤣🤣.. nothing else matters to him
And this is why you don't overpower a car, they turn to shit. This video is a lot more boring than i expected it to be until the last race.
as usual ! Was really looking forward to this Video but then it was all over the place and the cars kept playing up ... heavily tuned cars are rubbish!! . granted in the rolling races when they werent fucking up they were SERIOUSLY quick
A perfect lesson to not tune your car
What a mess😂😂😂❤️
While this was as exciting as always, you have to wonder, tuning these beasts won't have  much of an effect in your daily usage. It's solely to show you car off on days like these. But damn if you can't even do that, whats the use of tuning. Just ruins the car.
I love the cuts to both their perspectives 😂😂 hilarious, good editing. Best episode
Try standard compact SUVs pls.
Porsche driver cheated all over man
Tuned cars are shit
👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
Yanni should learn how to drive
That was a sick video 👍
You should bring the m5 evolve
Pontiac blackbird vs silver bullet
Where's the Bugatti??
These companies are a joke compared to Iroz, UGR, and Cicio.
Why they dont just let the owners drive?
😜👈🏼fuck it tune cars 🤲🏻stock Porsche Turbo s 10.2 second
Is that not Arthur's car and Nick is his son?
That TT RS behaves like a Honda VTEC
Amaziiiing!  :-D
Literally the Porsche driver cheated on every run apart from the 3rd drag run
the 5 banger sounds so nice jeez
Is a noob driving the porsche? He cocked up everything.
Still.. the new stock one does 10 secs so...?
Wauw, my personal favorite video of carwow.
Feel like I'm part of the race now, everyone is so hands on
So after all that, a 140k Tesla Plaid model s would’ve won that drag race. 😳  Edit: To the people from the future, the plaid model s was just announced
That TT's TURBO is ABSOLUTELY MENTAL!!!!!!
Wow😳
Kids.. look at this Porsche. That's how you cheat in a rolling race.
And people think they can live with a highly modified car everyday
TT RS V-Tech kicked in first rolling race 😂😂😂
Jajahaha gianni eats the r8 tachometer
Sewer hose intake on the RS is bad!
That R8 is mental 😍 i want it...
Use me as a "the horn test should also be obligatory" button
honestly i thought the TT would break and the Porsche would have walked the R8
Ray is a cheater
Idiot yany
Don’t know what it felt like on the day, but watching this made me feel so frustrated! Tuned cars are great yet very picky when they want to work
lol.. this was exciting!!! big ups guys
This one gonna get more views than the one with Rimac
Porsche driver 👎🏼
2.5 vs 5.2 audi
I thought the Porsche actually would be the most problematic and never even doubted the R8, but ... well.. guess i was wrong.
It's not a car. It's a rocket
With tuned cars you should always let their owners race
FIRE THE F PORSCHE DRIVER ALREADY! F BS TO THE MAX
Tune cars are the shit 🤘
Matt loves a good cry…..
Amazing race...thank you carwow
The driver in the Posche is shit. (I´m not better)
I hate all Porsche 911..... Who wins him  for less than 350k?
That's three 9sec cars with over 3500hp
These videos are great, they are my favorite mat if you could make more like these that would be amazing
The internal rooster speculatively sneeze because decrease resultantly exercise beyond a cautious approval. jumpy, same ramie
What's up with that Porsche driver.
The guy in the Porsche is "slow"? Can do anything right?
I would say VAG makes a mean car…but these are all VAG cars.
And now this is a proper Drag Race. R8 owner you should check sheepey race channel. Their R8s always engage launch control and rolling launch. MoTec magic there!!
All that money effort and unreliability to beat a standard 911 Turbo S  by what? Half a second? The moral is.. they're not worth it. Buy a 911 Turbo S. Simple
You should one day take a look at the "Il Tempo Gigante" car in Norway, and do review of it. It is such an epic one of a kind car. pls take a peview look here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sbOjg2Mx8M
Sheesh in the second race the 911 was behind and still killed them wow.
9+ SECS on an unprepared tamac is consequent to demonic tuning. WOW cars for real!
Who the F would put 1000hp in a hair saloon car??
Has to be the worst driver ever in the porsche. Is he challenged? No offense i am curious
Just goes to prove that these cars are tuned poorly and beyond their limits as they are so unreliable and nigh on impossible to launch first time every time. In the real world on the road they would get beaten by tuned cars with less power that are much more reliable through professional tuning by someone who knows what they are doing.
Ray is a shitttt driver wow
Why don't you guys do a hypercar race
audi tt sleeper
Man that was a fun episode
Horn test?
Those were stupid quick...holy schmock !!!!!
I want to see Rimac Nevara against Tesla Model S Plaid
Seeing how insane this 10 seconds  cars are it made look differently at Fast&Furious 1 where they were building 10sec cars left and right like it was nothing
I could never understand why would someone wreck an engineering master piece....maybe the TT.. but the R8 and the Porsche, it's like repainting the Sistine chapel.
Its good to see Arthurs car on here; that TT RS is a beast.
Yeah, the Porsche guy did his best to cheat every time to assure a win...
That Porsche driver is cheating badly, starting accelerating from behind. Omg. I just watched the brake test. You should never ever invite that pathetic cock on your channel. Shame.
The pre facelift r8 is soooo much better than the new one
How come a 2.5L 5 cylinder produce more hp than a turbo V10 R8?
Thats why im not going any further then Stage 2 tuning on my car, I still have to be able to use it.
This is why there are reputable Tuning companies that guarantee you the best performance and reliability!!!  They work closely with Automakers and know exactly the limitations, but overpay for it.
yianni on this episode : 👹
@07:31 Yianni was so excited his brain forgot how to do the thumbs up gesture. 😂
No matter what you say about the driver of that Porsche that car is hella fast
That’s why I dont care about these tuned cars. Most of them really dont do the business.
Porche being porche. Excellent car.
You guys are awesome!
Just mental. Loved this vid.
funny how all did that showed us was how much better unmodified cars are.
I mean tuning a 911 is like giving cocaïne to an ADHD kid unecessary but fun
I’d definitely choose the Audi R8 because it’s the more balanced (in terms of weight distribution). What beautiful symphony from those engines. Wow. PLU$H (peace, love, unity, $trength and harmony) $t888 out of Jamaica 🇯🇲💪🏽🙏🏽.....
This makes the 765LT look even more like a monster, it does 9.4 on the street on stock tires
Imagine spending all that money and time for something that doesn't even work...🤦‍♂️ Basically a promo for what tuning companies not to use?🤣🤣👌
The guy with the porche cheated in this entire video. 😑
I wish I was there to hear those cars
Shame you gotta cheat to make the porsche look good on a channel you'll never be as big as.  I get its a monster but we'd appreciate it more if you showed its potential compared to other tuned cars. No tuned car is the same, its all done by hand.
Yanny: This thing is schewepid. The Owner: Indeed mate.. indeed
Disappointed by the 911 as on another channel that featured it the ES representative driving it claimed lots relating to it's performance and reliability !
Leave the hood closed. Focus on tires, brakes, and suspension. Why ruin those beautiful cars. They are great from the factory. Plaid is here. Forget acceleration. The game is over. Road course time.
Awesome video. When we going to see the new bmw m5 cs vs the new Porsche 911 turbo s. Would love to see those 2 cars tested
this is not carwow anymore, just jaw dropping 10s cars
what the fuck is that porsche guy doing
next one.. model s plaid
Fair play to that Audi, other then the brakes it was the most consistent
Takeaway: don’t tune your car 😅
All that cheating is not the good look  the tuning company of the porche
So here’s what happened. People spent large amounts of coin only to not click off a 9.3 so Plaid takes the win. Ouch.
ES MOTOR PORSCHE WIN 🥇
The R8 vs the Rimac would be a good race still think it would lose
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA, Matt and Yianni are the bests omg much love
Ray sucks at this game messed up everything and cheats
Another perfect advertisement for car tuning 🤣
For the TTRS turned against the fastest porsche and R8 turned it still did perfomed very awesome for the slowest one against the fastest cars of all time 911 and R8
mental 😦😦
Thank you for showing how tuning ruins the cars
Porsche :perfect ok..
ESMOTOR a Türkiye'den selam soylemesem olmazdı 🇹🇷
Dear car manufacturers.  Please shove your particulate filters up your ass. Sincerely.  Everyone.
i think everyone should wear helmets for 200mph+ races
No matter what type of Porsche is there ... it EATS ALL DAY ...
Come on lads ! This is not a race ! Proper race cars there ,but no one driving them properly 😢😞😔..
Awesome Video! Yani looks mean while he is shifting.
Hey Mat, please don’t invite that porsche driver on the next carwow video ever again.
Porsche wins every time! only a supercar can beat a porsche! and a tuned GTR!
wasn't the tt from Nick's father?
Great video! Demonstrates how temperamental these things are once they’re modified. The ES stuff always seems to be the ones that don’t have issues.
The Porsche guy cheated  at the breaking and the Manuel
8:05 Matt paying homage to Michael Scott from The Office! 😂😂
Very biased you guys were about the Audis , when we all know the 911 is a far better car!!
Finally, after some time both Yanni and a 911 were there.  It was a race between companies who tunes cars.
This episode they've spent more tine explaining why they're not getting the performance they want than they do racing. 🏁😄😄
Ese yanny siempre le va mal 😄😄😄 saludos
Love the tuned cars editions !!!
Please don’t bring that porsche driver anymore
RICKY MY GUY(FROM LIVING LIFE FAST) HOW THE F DID CARWOW GET ARTHUR'S TTRS ONTO THEIR CHANNEL(AS A FINISHED CAR) BEFORE YOU DID????????????
Έτσι, ρε Γιάννη! Γ@μησετους τους όλους
This is ridiculous! For that much money, and with that much power, these cars should be WAY faster. A factory 911 Turbo S will run low 10s all day... literally. And an R8 with twice the HP?! I'd be pissed to spend all that for barely a second quicker. Sad to say the most reliable car between these 3 is a TT.
Matt- yeeeeeeeeeeee Yanni- my launch control didn't engage  Matt- noooooooooooo, I was doing wellll  LoL 😂
Porsche guy aint got a clue
What a frustrating episode, with all the issues the cars was having.. the ESporshe is quick, but in my opinion wasn't obeying the stop test or the rolling race rules....
The unknowns here made this drag race one of the most entertaining to watch!
It should be illegal for the porsche driver to mess up this bad. Ffs. Lol
TTRS has really cool sound
The porsche driver should be tested for doping.  Do without him next time please.
Hagan el video en español
Do a drag race with the Hyundai 130N DCT VS Renault megane Rs trophy Dct
Nobody Yianni : Ill do it live!
You have the BEST drag racing channel ever! My only problem, and it is my problem is I can't understand 50% of what Mat says. Yanny is such a good mate for Mat. Anyways, I'll take the Porsche! Thanks...
Just goes to show that highly tuned cars are shit
Ray, you suck. Either you're the biggest cheater, either you're the worst driver ever.
Let the owners drive the modified cars. They're more familiar with the car.
Physics is a b#tch.. all the extra power for not a massive difference in time
You really should do the side by side spec comparisons every video!
So in other words, a stock Plaid is faster than all 3 of these heavily modified cars, and more reliable.
Head to head Audi show down with some clown in the background driving around in a Porsche.
3 sub 10s cars, holy shit.
Audi ❤️❤️🇩🇿🇩🇿
None of these guys can drive
3 “Audis” 😎😎😎🚀🚀🚀
I think that r8 or Porsche would beat the Nevara in a roll race. When their turbos spool theirs no chance!
that must be the biggest loser i all of carwow life spand 2 times i row that  Porsche 911 cheatet LOL what a kido
Fuck this Porsche guy and R8 launch control problems. Would have been interesting to see how these cars actually performed against each other.
MENTAL
I love to see everyone else feels the same about the 911 driver Ray. What an absolute knob, he’s either so incompetent and doesn’t know how the rules work or he’s cheating to save his place at the company. Mug.
That new Rimac hypercar blitz's these power houses! That's nuts.
I would not have eihter of these three since it proved that tuned cars rarely perform and you're just making a fool out of yourself when you try.
Carwow should be given the consistency award... video almost everyday..  the hard work... 🙌🤗❤
10:36 "He wants a RIMAC?". 😂
R35 its my Dream ar, I will buy one before Electric cars are on the planet. Thanks, Carwow.
Yanni’s face at 10:18 😂
Dare I say that Porsche was S@!t
Prob a good advertisement for not fckn about with your already fast car lol
Porshe driver biggest cheat on carwow channel ever 🤣
Ray needs to watch your channel so he can learn how it works #PorscheforLife
Issues and still all were pulling sub 10s.
Porsche aka king of the motorway
Love how Mat thinks he's winning the race, even when he's the only one  IN the race ! lol
Mat having a 'crisis' 3:24
The moral of the story is, sure you can tune your car but don’t expect it to work properly afterwards 😂
The header of the stats does not perfectly align with the body!! *TRIGGERED*
I would like them to put Alfredo Valenzuela r8, a Mexican youtuber whose r8 has more than 2,000 hp is a beast
Porsche driver is an absolute waste of space................................
That TT is fucking bonkers :DD
Tuned cars are just Drama Queens. Always something wrong.
It’s a shame that all this engineering will go to waste and be forgotten when electrical tuned cars come on the scene in a few years time.
Did Yanni get his teeth whitened the same place as Ross 🤔🤣
Whhhhhat!!!  All 3 in the 9’s. Such a good set Matt n Yanni
The turbo in the RS is too big for the car. You can see it had nothing until about 5K-6K. It was just for the hp figure. Probably drives awful. Whoever was driving that Porsche should be shot.
Is it me or did that Porsche cheat in every race?
Moral of the story -  stock 911 turbo is 10.1sec. Es motors tuned 911 turbo 9.7 secs. Price for upgrade 90 000 £. This was the worst pr possible for es motors.
Torque should be atleast 2000NM 😭
All this shows is when you throw a bunch of crap in these cars it fucks them up .
!! Super LOL @ the 3:18 mark !!
Absolute fun, loved it, you guys rock❤️
U guys r nuts man 🤘 we need to see that porche one more time in carwow 💥🔥
U guys r nuts man 🤘 we need to see that porche one more time in carwow 💥🔥
На порше какой то отморозок
The Porsche driver messed up too much , we don't want him again !!
So then, what exactly happened? Porsche driver cheated big time until the car went bust.
Not sure if Ray in the Porsche understood what was going on... stay level
Spettacolo 😍
Keep level FFS
mate you guys let the respective owner drive their cars [Tuned cars] coz it will be fair race with them handling properly
That Porsche was like two car lengths behind when he said go, and it still fucked them both up 🤣
11:53 r8 was like harder daddy yani
tuned turbo this problem if change this gear #dearindonesian
Carwow on 🔥🔥
The 911 cheated on the brake test
The Porsche may as well have not been in the race because of his cheating you don't get an accurate result :/
Porsche is way more expensive and not worth all that extra money. Audi R8 was awesome. Also Porsche driver couldn't drive to save his life lol. Your mom drove way better in that video you did with her. 🤣 maybe she can come drive it next time. 👍
Is it a new gold rush, or is it just another online bubble waiting to explode at any second? Ever since Bitcoin’s creation in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto – an individual or group of people whose identity remains unknown today – the cryptocurrency increasingly gathered global interest. “Bitcoin” searches on Google were much higher than that for “Ethereum” in 2020, with Google Trends adding that interest was particularly high in non-Western countries
Yo Matt, how bout a drag race between that 1000hp m5 and these three, it would be fun
Never ever invite that porche driver again please!
Yianni's confidence about R8😅 that’s crazy
This darg race was nuts.
..... No quarter mile times, Porsche doing whatever it wants, nobody even on the rolling races.....this had potential to be a great video but......
Cheaper too buy a Yamaha R1 haha
that was craaaaazzyyyy man !!awesome !!!
04:27 Race starts nearly 5 minutes in, ridiculous. Remember when these drag races didn't have all this fluff preamble in the beginning so it started within a minute?
Never new the Audi TT had vtec 🤣
More of theses tunedcars💪💪
Plus sign on the r8 in the end :- please have mercy on me
All we wait races with tesla model S plaid!
Tuned gtr🤌🏼
Yianni: I'm so excited Car: Imma Kick You Down A Notch  😂😂😂
Basically it’s just a race between VWs
Love how they weren’t even gonna try to beat the Porsche, it’s already crazy fast stock.
Please let the owner for drag race in this type of cars
The porche driver is dead never get him on again
This channel hasn't bring Buggati 😒
Forsage 10 in the sleeps
This was the best yet! OMG!!!!!
Cheating Porsche
porsche driver cheated almost every race.....smh
sooo brutall
somebody kick the porsche driver's ass, what a failure! it did nothing right
1100hp TT RS and an intake that looks like its from home depot
The New word for cars over 1000hp is ...... (YANNIE) THIS  IS "STUUPIDDDD" FASTTT🤣😂🤣🤣😂
Carwow is incomplete without Yinny :)
Why porche driver always cheating with starting first...
Porsche 991??? 🤣🤣🤣🤣
That stank face by Yianni at 11:54 when he was changing up had me dying🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
My Dacia Sandero is better than all 3 combined ! 🤣
you watch all dis carwow videos and end up buying a tigwan 😂
That Porsche driver really was a dick for all the tests. Pointless having that car in the video, as no test was done fairly by him
If porsche doesn't win, i will block you...
Porsche driver is a proper bellend
The dragrace we all needed but didn't know we did.
12:06  Yianni looks almost like he's possessed by a demon. LoL
Casual 1000 + hp race..
A credit please to Arthur.
The audio and video didn't match only for me or others too
This drag race actually got me excited in finding out who’s gonna win!!! Great vid!
Wonderful
The one in the Porsche is a bellend.
Wass very Very suprised with the TT having 1100 BHP😳😳😳
Porsche is one quite guy who actually rocks the school 😆🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
the porsche driver was so braindead he cant hold the line 😂🤦🏼‍♂️
If there was ever a video to demonstrate the reasons against tuning....
„So then what exactly happened?“ -> I know I would never give my car to those „backyard tuning companies“. 😀
8:04 No No Nooo Noo😭😭😭😭😭 sounds like horrid Henry 😂😂😂
please do a typical suv race like the land cruiser etc
@ESMotor fails all day then bails on the last race. 👏🏻
paused on the stats, porsche all day long. let's see
More tuned races!
Guy in Porsche, no comment... cheated every single time
Tt rs sounded best
Bruh the Porsche guy kills the vibe in such a sweet video.. no talking, never leveled with the cars literally just wanted to be stubborn and win no offense
The fearful fearless colon understandably trick because purple scilly challenge next a eight zoo. majestic, gainful asia
this video is 100% accurate about tune car drag races.                    99% talking           1% racing
Ray can't keep in line  Wth
Tuned cars are rubbish) Guy in a 911 is jumped all the time, rolling race, brake test, drag racing. Seems like hi will be fired from tune company, if he will not win everything.
this is the most chaotic and all over the place carwow video ever😂
Itching for an M3Comp Vs M4Comp vs X3MComp vs X4Comp drag
This is a hotass mess..
this was INTENSE.
Porsche driver is a cheat...
Should have stuck a carwow driver in the 911 as he was clueless with everything...  However respect to both audi's ans as they say no replacement for displacement....   V10 powerrrrrrrrrrrrr
I'm think I've learned to save my 80k and just leave it stock.
This would have been a good EsMotor commercial... If the driver didn't mess up everything.
The dispensable bay clasically lighten because comb syntactically puncture modulo a useless cloud. willing, proud veterinarian
The tuned car videos are so good
I think 🤔 all Germany tuning car is shiiiiit .it isn't japan car's
C'mon, Ray! Ray, then leaves.
Mat should get that BMW M5 again 🔥
Więcej reklam, więcej
Worst CarWOW video I've seen, boring beyond belief, all because of the Porsche driver. Worst driver and worst personality I've seen on the channel so far 😂.
Always bring Yianni. Lose the Porsche driver. Get a Plaid in there. Love the channel.
3:58 Did the Porsche just follow through??…..
90% people in comments - Driver is Porsche is such a cheat 10% people- What a great race!
Best video ever
Thank You for showing staaats
Matt seemed very stressy in that TT... The fear of it exploding must of been real lol
5 cylinder goes BRRRRRRRRR!
One things for certain. The Porsche driver is a prick.
So now this r8 is the quickest so far in carwow....I guess🔥🔥🔥
The Porsche seemed best, but the driver needs to get his head in it
Fire the Porsche driver- Complete idiot
No brainer the ES Motor Porsche would be fastest. But serious budget required. The thinking man's choice is the twin turbo R8. The TT is a nice project, maybe fun for events but doubt you would want to drive it on the road much.
This video perfectly shows how problematic can tuned cars be, but still they are lovely
Always problems with tuned cars 😔
Bearded guy is hilarious !!!
M5 CS vs GT63s
9.4s? Holy shit.
The guy in the porsche messed up so bad so many times
Don’t bring Porsche driver back he ruined the video
Porsche is the daddy there no doubt
We need another video of this redone but with a different driver in the Porsche, he messed up everywhere.
Brabus 900
Well that was chaotic 😳😂
Gianni’s  face when he won, all the money mate 💶💷💸💵💴🤣🤣🤣
Top
ohhh love it
Porsche cheated every event looool
Interesting race😏 however that's a lot of extra 💰💰 only to ruin the reliability & have temperamental cars😓😵 Better off just throwing a SuperCharger on the Audi & keep it around 800-900HP or getting the new 992 Turbo S & throwing Cup2Rs on there w/carbon fiber wheels
Amazing! So exhilarating!
Just get a used 720s
Tuned car drag races are boring 🚮
Yianni the Beast...
The all test is f****d... Porsche driver cheating aaaaall the way Mat as louched the TT too many times Yanni had issues with the launch... You guys should have took a break, check the cars and done the all test from the beginning
That Porsche driver was dodgy af
The problem with racekors is that 68% of the time they don't work 😭
So they basically put a vtec in that tt ?D
Please..... Race the amg gt Black series....!!!!
Guy in the 911 want to do his own thing. Please dont cast him next time. Thank you
Was the porsche guy awake?
Why is the PORSCHE even there? The driver can't drive to save his life
Hint: if you could, put one normal production car (like BMW M5) to see actual difference with these 😄
10:43 theres 3 more yiannis in the backround😳
Love all these super high horsepower mod cars that have nothing but issues.
Great video, best one for a long time, awesome! 😄
no way the TTrs is so heavy
2:58 yianni sounded like he was about to take part in a battle in Star Wars.
Why dont you do a rolling start from say 1000 rpm in 1st this will take out all the traction  issues, as no wheel spin cos the engines not on power a much better test of real world road use. fast launch control then wont be an issue, as in Yanni,s case  here this 1/4 mile stuff, its not indicative of a ..normal  ordinary driver..  who  cant nail it spot on.
Volkswagen, das auto.
To much nervousnes and grimases for nothing.
michelin PS4 on 1100hp TTRS?  what a joke  lol
7:52 OMG Matt :DDDDD
That Porsche driver needs to be changed. Definitely hate that driver.
SUPERB VIDEO!
Videos like these are the perfect advertisement to not tune your car.
460 plus hp on the Porsche and only a drop of .3 seconds WTF?
has the porche driver ever drove before?
Too bad.  The Porsche driver couldn't drive that well!
That Audi R8 is beautiful and fast.
Matt Do a Reverse  carwow Drag Race. 😁😁
This race was the most funniest and most exciting race ever
So Matt didn’t win two times as he said. At least he’s still alive and had fun. Yianni went through the gamut of emotions ending with the million dollar smile before the recap. Good fun.
Those cars are INSANE
Where's The king BMW?
Guys you really think i can hear that car sounds of my crappy headphones?
I hope the Porsche driver comes to the comments section just to see everyone expose his cheating. Ruined the video. Hope he gets fired like Mat joked.
1100 hp tt rs?  Maybe 1100 hp on boost peak 😅
Where is evolve?? Too bad Matt... You missed out there
Is ray a moron ?
Who ever was driving tha Porsche is not supposed to race anymore he cheated and fkd up in every single race lol mann 😶 the both audi did awsome tho great vid Matt and carwow team ❤️ lolove
Mat, amazing video!!! Now for the sf90 and la ferrari please
Yannie is Hilarious the Face of No Failure 😂😂
Seems more like a ‘behind the scenes’ video than a final cut 😅
Why did the Porsche pull out like a baby?
Horsepower means nothing without reliability
ahahaahahahah Rematch
3400 лошадинных сил, в одной гонке)
Porsche cheater.
Porsche 9ff ist the best ! Made in Germany <3 Kills all
This video had me so excited it helped my constipation!!!
the boost in the ttrs is something out of this world
That porsche driver doesn't understand a word.
Jesus christ the Porsche  driver, literally  cheated in every race hope they do a retest on this it was actually  blatantly obvious and matt just turned a blind eye obviously ,
Tities and arsse best audi name ever
Simply fuckin EPIC‼️
Porsche driver cheated in the brake test and made sure he was lagging behind in the rolling tests so that his car was already building momentum when Mat reached 1 in the count. Total cheat!!!
Pilot sport 4’s on an 1100hp ttrs at a video shoot where it’s trying to win a race from a dig??
Sick
That Porsche is on a whole another level
Porsche Power 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀💪
Pay attention, Matt! Wtf
Bro that TT is a rocket
All slower than the Model S Plaid 😂
I feel like the Porsche was at an advantage in the rolling races because when Mat counts down its not level with the others and when he finally says go its level but it's going a couple of mph faster than the rest of them and it's already got more boost
The TT impressed me the most!! R8 obviously so quick, just by Yanni’s expression and reaction  ES Motors, big HP, but no good if it’s unreliable. I’ve seen big figure claims, but if it’s not sustainable then it’s pointless.  I grew up with tuned cars, Escort Cosworth, mine was a modest 406bhp, MADevelopments, we used to do all the shoot outs, performance Ford, Top Gear, Clarkson Full Throttle Christmas video, I think our 2 MADevelopment cars were the least Bhp against Castle Perf. Etc etc, but we tranced them all, 1st and 2nd all day everyday. Never a hiccup
Ray was rubbish
I love tuned cars drag races on Carwow.
Well whoever driving the Porsche is shite at getting level lol
Why would someone spend 80 grand on mods to go even faster but not spend the 2 grand to fix your breaks with a newer larger set? Makes no sense at all.
ray is dumb
I love the Porche but he cheated. Used momentum...
The guy in the Porsche cheated!
Awesome race 👍👏
EARGASM
The guy in yhe Porsche is absolute imbecile. There was not a single time when he will get in line, would start to break or accelerate way earlier. What a Muppet
Yanni changes gears like he's a murderer killing him victim
Imagine having all that horsepower but losing to a fine tuned Lada because…you didn’t get the settings right in your menu. Lol.
That porshe kept cheating lol
That Porsche wow
4:36 boost loading...
3 over-priced tuned and less than reliable cars. funny to watch though
Lol funny how no one cared about the porsche
Don’t let the Porsche guy drive again lol
Good drag race.  I'm just sad not having a BMW and a Mercedes equally with 1200hp in this batch
I really want you to do a race between the bmw m340i saloon and the m440i saloon and a Audi s4 saloon and the Mercedes c43 saloon please make this race happen matt
Why is this porsche guy cheating this much?
That es motor guy is the biggest cheater in carwow history what a king
Yianni best reaction 🔥🔥🔥🔥😂😂😂😂
How refreshing to hear loud cars again for once. Technical issues, and that bad Porsche driver aside, this was a real party. Made me think that I hate silent cars and the EU morons.
But it's fair to say overall the Porsche is the quickest and the coolest car
Who the hell is in thay porsche? Sucks. Get rid if him
This race need to be re-done awesome cars, poor driving by the porsche and the r8 with problems
Porsche driver was a joke
The best drag so far
TT❤️❤️❤️
As usual, Porsche wins!
BMW>Mercedes>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Audi
the Porsche clearly has the best power delivery of the three cars, that rolling race proved it hands down.
Whose in the Porsche, get that person a translater or something... clearly he doesn't understand what's "get level "
Tuned cars are way too temperamental.
The Porsche is the biggest cheater
This is a horsepower game.
Porsche's pilot f*cked with the video...
This was the best race I have seen until now, awesome 👍
That TT has a nasty hold! Thats why it’s unloading in 3rd. Just tune the NOS time another millisecond and you’ll shit your pants.
Porche driver cheated in rolling races and braking test
A fun one after a long time
The Porsche driver clearly had issues
Ray was on some shit tho
Are we going to ignore the fact that these cars are just 0.5 seconds behind the stock 911 with 10.1
Ray's a cheat
Ray cheats on each run, kills both runs he was loosing,  jumps the drag to win then when ever the other two re run... too hot mate!
Epic just Epic! Great content 👌love the stats and the times you include. Bravo 👏
0:56 Matt: "Let's move on to the Audi" Says Mat from an Audi..
This is the most unorganized carwow video I've seen since watching carwow
Moral: Stay Stock
The porsche driver just ruin this race
Jesus christ, get some consistency on your drag races Carwow, you either have bad drivers or complete cheats like this Ray guy. He was speeding up before you started counting and braked early before the car passed the line.
That sums nick up, 80k on going fast nothing spent on stopping. Don’t like him
Where was Arthur????
Enjoyed this, was a bit different. Good stuff
This Nick guy has cool cars but he is too worried about driving them hard
plis  new tesla palid.
Crazy that a completely standard 992 911 turbo s does 10.1 😱 ... that's not too far off for almost half the power 🤔
Do a couple practice launches to avoid all that "it didn't go anywhere" stuff
Fucking hell Ray. Sort it out mate.
This channel is like water, Matt you are flowing, go on like this.
" I want a Rimac" 😂
Is Ray high or something? he is all over the place
I don’t think the owner really cared yanni, I think he just wanted his car back and u not crashing it 😂
This was so far the most chaotic race ever in Carwow……
Es motors rules.. Excuses from both audis.... 911 is still  and always will be king!!!
Mat is that kind of drivers who never use their side mirrors!
The TT, ITS ARTHURS CAR
Luxury or no luxury always be proud of your brand and try working to improve. I love luxurious lifestyles. All thanks to crypto I just got my first Lamborghini 💝. My advice to y'all invest in cryptocurrency or gold.
we NEED a rematch....
Porsche was CHEE-TING
gR8. Luv that Audi.
OHMYGOD CARWOW please give us more than just one second of the sound of these cars! I thinkg it's just too much cutting and switching camera angles during those drag races.
Get someone who won’t cheat to drive the Porsche. Jumped the rolling race, wasn’t level on the brake test, then dropped out on the drag race when all the cars were performing as they should.
There was me thinking it was Nick’s Dads car
Incredible incredible incredible 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Epic !
Powers are similar to season final episodes of YuGiOh
Plz, time for Stig coming. Dats grandfather's bones can't drive fast car.. fck dat..
I’m guessing the Porsche wins.
Quisiera dar muchos like a este video, lamentablemente YT solo me permite 1
can you just not let Ray drive any cars on the channel?
M8, let the tuners drive the cars, I couldn't care less if Yianny doesen't drive the car
Dealerships are going to be showing this video to people when it is being explained to them why their warranty is voided after modding their cars.
Those cars are amazing (but i like more standard cars). Definily you bring the Porsche así camera car, again
nah fam that porsche was cheating all the way through the rolling race and break test
Waiting for the Tesla S Plaid race!!!!!!!
Wtf was the dude in the Porsche doing? Literally did everything wrong
Mat babababaab-ing is the highlight of the day for me
That Porsche drive needs to get fired, can't drive for sh1t! Ruined half the tests.
What kinda dumb... drives the porsche lol
1100HP TTRS 9.9 is stupid slow, 700hp cars are faster wtf?
I just Pity that girl on the start line . These cars can take off at 45 degrees
Millions of views on the way guys!
Seriously, what's wrong with the Porsche driver? Can't keep level to save his life, I count all his wins as useless coz it's just not a fair gauge.
Stupid Porsche driver…
When are you getting the Tesla model s plaid?
Bottomline is..Porsche never loses a drag race..even when it's slower 🥲
Best vid of the year so far!😂
Rematch 14.
Awesome video pls more vids like this
This is getting ridiculous now
I feel absolutely terrible for Matt and the rest of the people involved making this test. Next time dont let a tuning company drive their own car unless they are willing to actually test it properly, entire video ruined by the porsche driver cheating in every way he can.
We need a redo that Porsche driver is trash
Insane tuning, insane racing! Loved it!
Where's the roll race ??
That man in the Porsche🤷‍♂️
Never seen Yiannimize so exited, best race so far
That's a lot of f!%*@ng about. Makes me never to even remap mine or even JB4 it. Love that Porsche though! (Even though it's only 3 tenths quicker than a stock 911 turbo s at about 80 grand dearer!)
the Porsche guy needs to find a diffrent job
My cat drives better thank this Porsche driver lol.
Wtf was that porsche doing?
Where's evolve m5 ? 😙😚
The porsche driver ruined these races. He probably doesn't know the meaning of " level "
Most exciting race for me by far 👍👍
Whats up with that porsche driver? Is he a child or an idiot? We CLEARLY NOT HAPPY WITH HIM!! Cheaters.  Anyway, thank for bring back the stats table. Good job as ussual carwow.
Yianni's focus face hahaha 11:53
That Ray should be banned from driving....
First time seeing matt look like he shit himself
VW wins again
Bro the porche is like rimac right now ..wtf😂? Too quick
911 driver noop...
you should do a trackhawk in one of your videos
Porsche got a red card towards the end...
Porsche guy fucked this video properly.
Ray cheated so much during this video
The Porsche is cheating in every challenge, like nobody's gonna notice🤣
All this money to tune the car and they don't even run right :/
All this work thanks guys
The 911 was cheating
As a matter of fact, I didn't think that the Audi would break down, what I thought was that it has 1,100 Horsepower and is the lightest in the group so it's got a clear chance of winning!
Best drag race ever
These cars sound real good
9.4s from a 1200hp R8.. Can't wait to see the Model S plaid being tested.
why dont u have any aston martin drag races ?
Once again ladies and  gentlemen, heavily tuned cars ain't really worth it.
Audi r8 is the new king
Porsche driver cheating a**hole cheated in every test... When he realised he was going to get rekt he pussied out...
10:13 🤤
Why did they even bother to let ray drive
🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷
Should have got 1000 HP Supra
why 5cyl ang 10cyl sound the same
the Porsche driver was cheating in brake test
"Ray" is useless
where's the 1000hp M5? oh, it's completely obsolete 🤣
It seems like the only people who can drive these heavily tuned cars is their owners
porsche driver cheated whenever he could
I really wish we had a cam in the porche
That ray can't drive in a dragrace. Not 1 rolling dragrace he was levelled, neither was he in the braking test.
The Porsche driver is a cheater 🤣
Welcome to another episode of porsche being porsche & kicking other car's ass
This was like a boxing match, with rest times and coach giving advice on the right tactics etc
4:44 that my friend, is a turbo gap
Soo...Porsche stock =reliable...Porsche modded=reliable..sounds about right!
No soft limiter on that Porsche for sure
Drag race a toyota fortuner and and a hilux
Yanni keeps crying and asking for remach until he wins...I think next time you should keep Yanni count intead of the lady 🤣🤣
That was insane!!!
vs Tesla S Plaid
That Porsche driver’s cheat game is on a whole other level. It was very irritating 😠 how he cheated at every opportunity. All we wanted was a fair race!!!
R8: DON'T LOSE TO THE TT... TT: WHY AM I SO WORRIED...
Appreciate the fact that Carwow upload a new video almost daily. It’s part of my routine entering YT looking for new videos. My respect
The guy who was driving the porsche was just cheating
This is the most chaotic drag race video by Carwow.😂😂😂😂
That Porsche Cheats in every race ??!!!!!!!!!!
Just let the owner of the r8 drive that damn thing himself... wasting so much time
I was about to go to sleep but I can sleep after this video..
That was FKING SICK!!!!
Es motor. Product in Turkey...yeap
3 ruined cars
The porsche broke 20 meters early
and that audi r8 is barely started...there are lots of lambos with twin turbo at over 2000 horses.
So the crown of the best 1/4 mile goes to Audi now. That was really impressive!
Madness
Conclusion: Brits can't tune for shit
When Matt and Yanni think they are Senna and Prost talking to the team to beat each other...
Rather fickle beasts and entertaining!!
and the nevera did 8.6 s with no drama xD
That Porsche literally cheated in everything 😏
what was that porsche driver doing? lol
9.4 that's a new record is it..
Porsche driver almost made this video not enjoyable. Thanks Mat and Yanni for saving the day
Ray definetly needs some sleep :D
Autotorque's R8 and Nick's TT RS Instagram account views = ++++++, ES Motor's 911 Instagram account views = *Tumbleweed
You should do audi rs6 c5 VS bmw e39 m5 VS mercedes amg e55 w210
2:31 The flames tho❤️ And then 3:31 the R8 flames also❤️
That Porsche is now faster than Evolve's BMW M5
Love the list of the stats! Next time can you replace the price with the transmission type? I will never be able to afford any of these cars lol
3X 10 second car! (Car)WOW!
The Audi and Lambo were such good sports. Shame we can’t say the same about the Porsche.
Does the Porsche driver know what LEVEL means lool
When the dashboard has more lights on then New York at night…those cars are just for show off. Never would pay that much money for such tuning. You cant even use that shit to compete in a drag race to crush your friends 😂
Top ranks  1. Rimac 2. Audi R8 (tuned) 3. Audi TT RS (tuned) 4. Ferrari SF90
Great video.. The guy driving the porsche was very frustrating (idiot) Mat Arrma have an RC called typhon  a lot of people tune them to go over 150mph you should get one on the channel and race it.... i love yarni when his in race mode class
🤔😄
Yanni's face on the final run was priceless... and a little scary!!
Mind blowing performance these cars are insane
The price on that Porsche is too much
without doubt the Porsche is fast but it would help if there was a better driver! first time I seen someone cheat on car wow not once but twice...
That TTRS 🔥🔥🔥😅
Fraud of a race, Porsche was being a fcuking WETTY! TTRS was best overall with the LEAST amount of issues.
How many engines to the mile do they get?
The obscene france complementarily clap because squirrel grossly escape round a long parsnip. safe, lavish volcano
That guy in the Porsche 🤦
Audi 🔥🔥🔥
That Porsche wasn't all there
Am a porsche fan boy but he cheated in all the rolling races and even the brake test. Smh... i think the r8 was fastest.
need to race this with that M5 from evolve.
🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷 ES MOTOR ❤️❤️❤️
I say those are some crazy cars but that Porsch is the fastest in the mile stretch 💯
Please get your hands on a model S Plaid, and race it against the fastest tuner cars you can find🤩🙏
7:05 The Porsche wasn’t clearly level at all, cheater.
Guy in the porsche annoys me
SICK! 911 with 1100hp is just half a second quicker than the new 911turbo s with 650hp.Please, SOMEONE PLEASE GET NEW TUNED 911!!!
Bonkers
Porsche is a cheating fool dont let him play in your circle of friends mate
Very fun race
Your guys gotta stop doing tuned races. They're always full of problems and its annoying
That Porsche driver couldn't start level at all
does this mean the r8 is the fastest car to do the quarter mile that car wow have drag raced?
Yani looking like hes about to pop and agressivly pulling a tiny klick button to change gear looked so stupid lol
The Exhaust from the Porsche is a little bit ugly
ES Motor should be ashamed of themselves for cheating like this.  Sound check: FAIL Roll race: CHEAT Brake test: CHEAT Drag race: JUMPSTART So glad the R8 won considering it's worth £85k less than the cheating Porsche.
It is PORSCH-E and not PORSCH !!  Why is this so difficult for English speakers ????
Ur races are all over the pace. No one is in time.
When you buy your son a kinder egg  Son: 5:02
Porsche driver should get a bicycle. Driving cars isn't his thing
That Porsche owner is dodgyAF !!
That R8 is mental in the words of Yanni
ESMOTOR🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷
now we know that audis are not reliable, go for porsche instead :D
It's scary that you can pay tens of thousands of bucks for a tuning and then it doesn't work properly.
Matt when you gonna release the race between MSLPERFORMANCE and evolve.. It's been 3 month ❗
Doesn't a stock 911 turbo s do like 10.1 consistent.. u mean all that extra power only shaved 4/10ths.. Surface?
Crazy crazy video😂😂😂
Audi R8 would have won, Porche driver tho...
Jeez these modified beasts can be wiped off the floor by a family sedan
Edge of the seat stuff .thanks guys. Nice to see Yanni win, for a change.
M5CS VS M8 COMPETITION OR MAYBE M5CS against GT63 AMG
TT and R8 - We are awesome💪💪💪💪.   Porsche - Get me a decent driver and hold my beer, as usual😅.
WTF is wrong with the Porsche guy ? 😐
This drag race was such a mess but hell it was fun to watch 🤘.
This was awesome
Absolutely fantastic.
Probably the most frustrating drag race in car wow but yanni got there in the end
Ray was doing ass the whole time 😂
Ray was shit
Porsche driver just ruined everything
Me: Why are there two different weights?! Oooohh.. that's the HP 🤭
loving yanni face in the race .
So, when you try to make 1100hp with 2,5l engine, you can only have 3000rpms of usable torque range.
Sees a carwow video..... Skips the first 3 minutes
ES-MOTOR, KINGS OF THE STREETS! 🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷
ES Motor all day every day : )
Looks like the Porsche keep getting the jump on all the drag and breaked before the others as well 🤷🏾‍♂️, but one the best drag regardless 👌🏾
I hate tuned cars
I swear Yanni makes these videos fun😂🔥
Imagine that cheaper, stock, reliable 911 turbo doing 10.00 ....
Why are u not in the Porsche matt.
Rematch
Porsche driver is a cheater. Don't call him again on carwow 😤😤
I wish they had voice chat on here so I could really take the piss out of matts wingy voice. Shaggy from scooby doo
Porshe driver cheated twice
Audi R8 TT with 1.200hp without built transmission? Good luck with that
Keep the guy in the Porsche, out of these races🤦🏽‍♂️
Ray cheated
Trade off,insane power for a few tenths but reliability is crap and pockets are empty,nah
shoulda let the owners drive the cars as they know it best.
The porsh is cheating always🤣
Scardest faces ever in a carwow vid.. mental
Pf course the Porsche.is best
That porsche definitely had a run up in the first rolling start race.  Edit: and the fucking 2nd one. 🙄 Edit: and seemed to cheat on the brake test
This is aethers ttrs isnt it?
Porsche very fast
Maybe you should use the R8/Huracan Performante from Klasen Motors or the R8 of BK Performance, both flying the 100-200 in under 4 sec
Nothing I love more than waking up to a 3000+HP drag race from mat and yianni!
Mindblowingly fast
Porsche the best
All 3 of these cars VS Evolves M5! Make it happen 👍🔥
How about golf R golf GTI golf GTD golf GTE please
4:26 race start
All people of UK are busy in WTC and here Mat is playing drag race
Bonkus
Really enjoyed today’s video!
That porche driver is Deaf..
One day imma drive something like this ;^;
The guy in the Porsche is cheating
That 911 driver wasn't aligning with the rest of the two cars before any start.... :/
As if the 911 Turbo wasn't fast enough 🙄
Only thing worse than a sore loser is a cheat and the driver of that Porsche cheats a lot! Starting a 50mph race at 55 or 60mph is not fair. Being behind in the break test and stopping at the same time. I wouldn't even take that porche into consideration in this test!
Nuts!
Porsche flopped 😂
The porshe guy does not know the meaning of level at all😂
Ahhh....PORSCHE was the best  No problem in tuning  And I think it would have won against R8
Cars tuned to this level just seem utterly pointless. It’s just so people can Willy wave at car shows. Give me the standard versions of these cars all day.
Wonder why it took soo long for you guys to put the stats on screen side by side, it’s really helpful 😅
That was fun you should've bring A tuned supra
Tuned cars are always a mess
U should put the trap speed and it will be perfect :)
Flapping a paddle. Might as well play a video game.
more tuned cars, please
I got the TT RS🤙🏽🚀
Porsche is a right cheater
The fantastic drag race ever! 👍👍👍
Whats wrong with porsche ☹️
The Porsche guy sorta cheated in rolling race. He was staying behind and not leveling, probably building up speed and boost ready to go. When that R8's boost kicked, it would have beaten Porsche in same speed start.
Just get the people who can drive the cars
Banging out a million views in two days for most videos, incredible!!
The porsche driver has been fired!
Porsche kinda sus but god that was a great video
I would love to see that bmw from evol in here with them
Please do tesla model s performance vs Porsche 911 turbo s
bring more tuned cars man,great work❤️
The thankful committee psychophysically zoom because perch ontogenically sail sans a majestic gateway. white, sable cell
Typical forza lobby 1000+ hp and awd
3 buffoons in modified cars trying to race ... not a good episode
a lot of trouble with the two audi, but it insane fast !!!!
The driver of that Porsche is so so bad .
Matt, I miss when you used to say “I’m SAT in a (insert car).” 😔
Matt ya'll need to ditch those radios for something hands free lol
Looks like we might want to think twice about going to ES motors. they actually to send a cheater to represent their company.
That Porsche driver cheated
Awesome 😁
The blue 🔵 is cheating
Do more tuner reviews!! Love it 🔥
Porsche driver up until 5am searching for ways to cheat the race
Seeing yani wins the drag race brings joy to everyone 😂😂😂😂
would like to see fastest electric car agianst heavily modified buggati those 2000hp drag race
bring the 1200hp GTR from autobahn
That Porsche cheated on damn near every challenge 😂
911
Probably one of the best Carwow videos I've seen. Amazing cars and you could tell both Matt and Yianni were proper buzzing
I have modified car that produces 2000  sheep power ,  wondering if I can join ?
German clunkers😂
So.... You get less than 10% improvement time  with a 80.000 pounds tunning job... and 10.000 times less reliability... Clearly worth it 😂😂😂
Should’ve brought the 1000hp M5
This one is worth to watch. Those cars are wicked
Never let ray drive again, he cant even line up ever
Please lets race the car drivers !
This video required recording in 60fps because of the cars.
12:29 This is schewpid!
They can have their crap cars, lmfao what a bunch of shitpile cars.
YES! Gotta love the TT 8J 😍😍
An other reason to love the manuals😍😂 you can't blame the car when you lose lol blame yourself
Porsche all the way
In Jezza"s voice....poweeeer🔥
The porsche driver made me MAD, what an idiot! So annoying when some one cheats so obvious, maybe he doesn't know that its gonna be a video and everyone will know?!?
There is no replacement for displacement.
Getting level during brake test is insignificant as long as you have same speed at the braking line.
Porsche wins ever!
Next porsche 911 turbo 1,100 HP VS bmw m5 competition 1000 HP
1000hp gtr skyline ....that m5 turbo ....and the winner that audi r8 twin turbo
Cant mat just brake boost in the rollong races
Guys guys i cant like every comment about the bad porsche driver
Porsche driver sucks
race them against the tesla model s plaid. then see who wins. could be an exciting and fun video
Try tuned honda civics above 1000 hps
This video was so messy dono why
Great job guys, hope you enjoyed the R8 we have it working perfectly now with Launch control and just done a 9.1 1/4 mile so we're ready for the next one!
ban that Porsche driver!
Whoooar! Nice work Mr Watson. That was super fun to watch!!!
Ray is clueless..that's what I learned from this
That Porsche driver is really dogsh1t. Not leveling, going before hands, braking before line...
You boys need to learn some driving before touching such modified cars ;)
That TT sounds like a mini huracan ??¿?
That's Arthur's TT👍
Best drag race yet! I was excited, must have been amazing driving the things 😎👍
Ever since I found Carwow on YouTube, I always look forward to the drag races and Matt's corny jokes. I appreciate the frequent uploads :).
Best 1/4 mile times of these highly modified cars: under 10s  Average 1/4 mile times of these highly modifed cars: about 5 minutes ;)
Living life.... Fast 😎
Alternate title : Sports cars on steroids.
Come ON you guys - I’ve seen learners launching better from red lights than you 😂. GREAT chanel - keep it up👍
Those cars are f***ing crap.
The guy in the Porsche was terrible...
Pretty sure that Turbo S pumps out 1600hp cause I've seen it on Officially Gassed's channel.
How tf these guys cant even build a good car but in usa the build rs3,r8,turbo s with 1500hp and they run perfect. ?
Damn!!! Excessively tuned cars are so f*cking temperamental!!! They can't even do the standard testing properly!!! It's very hard to evaluate whatever with so much sh*t going on!  Watching all the limitations happening is way to frustrating and ruins the viewer experience. But I'll give thumbs up anyway. Matt and his team always deliver.
Porsche driver was already accelerating before you said go on both the 50 mph tests..That's why he was way behind then floored it before he got level..
Porsche owner is not a good driver at all lol
Love the new stats screen
You guys suck at driving…
Volkswagen wins
Drag race are like who has the bigger junk. But it’s less on the brain
911 is nuts
Awesome! But worst rolling race starts ever. 😂
Dude driving the Porsche, like fucking seriously!!! Keep level with the other cars, not once except for the standing drag was he level
The tuned cars should've been driven by their owners to give a 100% output from their machines! While matt and Yanni should ride shotgun with them
These tuned cars do not work well
Make stats comparison look like this from now on please
Yianni's reaction when things don't go well is priceless
So buy a 992 turbo s and you are .3 slower?
What Mat says: "I'm in a highly tuned TT RS!"  What I hear: *"I'm in a highly tuned titi arss!"*
Great way to fuck up what could have been the best carwow video to date. The Porsche driver just ruined the entire video. I watched this angry
Porsche driver be honest,,
Who doesn't like this??? 😂 Your best video yet, keep up the good work!
These cars are ONLY gud for sound check and YouTube car videos on a Slap House Ghouse track. Thats it
Damn that TT RS has the same sound as Audi Sport Quattro S1 <3
Best sound check ever❤️❤️❤️
Your videos Suck now a days... Try something new
Hence why, don't tune the cars so many issues
Porshe massive cheat in the rolling race.
Great video as always!
Almost as fast as a Tesla Model S PLAID
Finally an interesting drag race again.
Porche  cheated on the break test 😂😂😂
So really... What is the point of spending 40k on a "tune" that makes cars performance worse ?
These tuned cars are always so unreliable piece of shit. Just slap massive turbo on and forget all else.
Because hair dressers need to go fast as well
9.4 monkaW
This video was just pandemonium 👍👍👍
That TT RS has 1,100 hp? What?!! 😳
Ray is such a cheater
R8😎💪💪
This was awesome 🤩
Putting the stats on the screen like that is brilliant
Ray cheating in every run 😂😂
Best race yet!! That was blisteringly Fast!!!!
The dude driver in the porsche ...he sucks....keeps being behind everytime its annoying
and neeexxxt to that is a por-cheater
just throw the 911 away. this is how u lose ur job mate..
What's the point of an 1000hp car today?
+ m5 f90 1000hp
Please buy a drone
The Engine on the R8 is a masterpiece, the link down show a time of 7.6 seconds with a 2500hp car, obviously on a track with perfect conditions. https://youtu.be/ShHAO0ET3qU
Porsche driver sucked so much, it was painful to watch.
Rimac nevera vs the concept 1
The porsche driver is a cheater 😉
12:00 Yanni's fave gives him an extra 100hp
Should of had arthur behind the wheel of the tt,legend👌
ray driving the Porsche highkey the biggest cheat
Seriously the porsche driver has something wrong with him.
This video can reflect the life of a honda tuner.  Sich expensive cars with such money are a piece of crap.. imagine about honda shit
Does Nick own it now instead of Arthur? I thought it replaced Arthur’s M135 and Nick has the GTR? Soz if I’m not in the loop
Do a Rimac vs Nevera
Is porsche driver drunken?
Yianni vs Mat running race😂
DAMNNN... now that was a good race... damnnn!!!!!
Lmao 😂 i forgot to change the playback speed back to 1.0. If you’ve ever wondered what a completely wasted Mat sounds like, watch it on 0.5x
Now you just have to realize that the Tesla S Plaid does 9.3-9.4s stock and let it sink in.
That Audi TT is so cool, would be even better with bigger brakes lol
Personly i perfer the tt than the r8
Cool race
That was awesome man ❣️
CarVWow
I'd rather have a stock car that actually works lmao
Waiting for the koenigsegg And bugatti Drag Race🤞🏽 and with yianni it would be hilarious 😂❤
Most dramatic drag race ever on YouTube you should change the title to this
7:35
hahahah nice
When the horse is too much, the likes are too much lol
Dope vid.
Nevera vs Bugatti!! 🤣
see now this is what i want to see not some slow ass cars racing 😂
Man that Porsche driver cheated in basically every single race. Please do it again with a proper driver. It ruins the whole video. So many awesome cars and that guy cheats his way through
Porsche: You can have perfect launches all day or 1100hp.
porsche driver is a cheater he was behind and was going more than 50miles
More Audis no surprise there
The look on Yainni's face when he beats Mat, priceless 🤣
Yanni got it almost right in the end that R8 is mentally quick but why the ES driver in his own car he knew how to get the thing to max out, Matt and Yanni were learning the car
THESE CARS ARE MENTAL!!!!! I think I jizzed my pants listening to them 😍😍😍
The guy in the Porsche was brain afk
the porsche driver is just.... tra..sh..
Ray spoiling my day
Seriously one of the maddest episodes in Carwow
This video was exciting af
The Audi TT sounds better then the R8
the guy in the porsche, is the most stupid driver i´ve ever seen
Yannie needed some foreplay first, he was breathing fire at the end but the Porsche was done cheating.. powerful race! Mat was confused af loool he was so hilarious
Pls do a 1400 hp huracan performante
The Porsche driver biggest cheat ever . And then backed out when he knew the R8 will take him on the drag race .
Wow
That Porsche is the mayor of GAP City
Tuned cars are nothing more than headache
🔥1 hour gang🔥
These tuned cars are useless because they never work
We need to get those audis against the model s plaid when it arrives
Not a great advert for those tuning companies when the cars can't work properly lol
I swear the Porsche cheated every time
slr vs a45s amg 😛
Fast as hell
ES Motors 🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🤘
Porsche driver almost ruined the race
The winner here will always be V.A.G.
Ray the kind of guy who never speaks but wins every event
Cheating brake test lol
Mat let yianni drive the 1000hp mkiv supra. And let's heat his comments
This video is nuts.  Everyone seemed to hurry up and finish the rolling and brake test fast.  Porsche driver not caring about anything. And Yannie. He got his eyes red out of frustration and anger. 😂💢
Dude in the Porsche sucks
Feels like even you three drivers were on steriods hahaha crank it upp
ray cudnt even get level... meh i'd take the tt
Spending stupendous amount of money to destroy the car ...
Porche never loss!
The porsche driver ruined everything
12:00 imagine seeing that face in bed 😀
meh
I don't even need to watch to know the Porsche won lol
I want to see him race tuned cars that are faster than that Rimac.  6-7 second 2500-3000 awhp cars.
And thats how Matt became a man
The one with a thousand horsepower won
When will we see marcedes gle amg version up against bmw x6m version? Mat???
Yanni you need lessons givevitvto the owner FFS
Another day another drag race
Just wow
i had no idea what went on in that video, but i enjoyed every single second!!!
Man these tuners need help
After racing these highly tuned cars do you hop in a golf r thinking it's slow ??
Soo freakin cool , Audi Power !!!!
Why is that porsche being allowed to take a run at the roll races
9.4?? That's madness. Come on. Let's prove ICE can go quicker than electric
Why spend thousands on tuning a car ,and then needing multiple tries at leaving from a standing start. Or worse still (yes Iam looking at you Porsche) actually have to drop out. So  On the right day,in the right conditions,with the right driver,the right combinations of settings and given a couple of tries,the tuned cars are fast. Meanwhile for the same price,a used stock super car will occasionally come last,but drive there,drive home,pop to the shops and take a good thrashing all in its stride.
That's Arthur's TT is it not?
thig guy in porsche cheats EVERY silngle time
It is crazy how you can tune cars now...
So the stock  911 turbo s the new one does 10 sec dead stock mentall 💣🚗💨
People who tune their vehicles and spend tens of thousands but can't utilize it because they break down, lol lol
these tunes are rubbish! the TT can't get any boost, R8 can't get of the line and the porsch overheats... what a waste of money and good cars
3:10 for those that can't be arsed with the yammering
This is a drama fuelled race.🤔 Directors actors entourage oh yes... functional cars!
Porsche driver didn't do himself or his channel any favours in this. Cheats throughout and then screws up the video by ducking out so he wouldn't end up losing the drag race.
A tuned defender td5 would be cool to see on here
Has Ray driven a car before?
10:18 The face of anger 😂😂
The coooolest yani ever....
Amazing somehow Mat pulled off the battle of the tuners that DMO tried 😅
:') awesome car..... , Think about 2.5 L  1000 hp
Get someone who can drive in that Porsche 😴😴
Can't wait to see plaid over here 😁
Let the owner drive the cars
Has the Porsche driver been hit in the head?
Include the Bmw M5 1000hp by evolve tunning!!
Türk markasının ingiltere ayağı. Aracı kullanan Ray(?), markayı layıkıyla temsil etmeye çalışmış herhalde.😒
This Porsche driver… killing me smalls 🤦‍♂️
Yanni saying he would won the 911 I was laughing
If car wow ever considers a rematch for this 3 cars... please get another Porsche driver.
I also felt 5:17
Wtaf was the buy in the Porsche doing
Let's go Ferrari SF90 stradale vs this monsters
Should have for Arthur in the TT, he'd of shown them!
This drag race is way to be the best one ever !
8:30 hey wtf that Porsche started early😠😐
🤣 I love the drama of tunes cars. It’s like jail breaking your iPhone back it the day
Ray was cheating all over the place in the rolling race and brake test!
Dont invite the porsche driver ever again. Not a team player at all! Embarrassed himself!
the problem with the Porsche driver was that he knew his car sounds the worst so he didn't rev it properly, he knew the TT r8 was faster from a dig so he dipped and he knew the TT r8 was better at breaking so he approached the cones slowly  deliberately especially because his company modded the car
Heh yeah TT R8 Next time should be TT Huracan
Well, the Porsche failed always to stay level with the others?! Cheeta 😜
Leave the guy in the Porsche alone, wasn't he up until like 5am the morning of the race? Probably almost falling asleep at the wheel.
Freaking Fantastic!!
This was insaaaaaaneee.
Whose the new drag king Mat??
Yea Porsche again the best
Now bring the Rimac against these monsters 😁
There is a chance that the car will go bfjfuciufidcijcjokfdkofdijfksodijfojfo -carwow
The TTRS is the most impressive car here less cylinders and less turbo's then both these other cars and it's cheaper
Whoever is in the Porsche messed up as much as he could.
McLaren 765lt please please
That was absolutely awesome 👌🏾.  I was super excited just to see the line up. All amazing cars 🚗🙌👌🏾 Well done matt.
That R8 no joke Mat😳 Just dropped a bomb 🔥
Synergy, was NOT at this drag event.
Congratulations to the driver of the porsche who managed to cock up everything and cheat.
That TT will eat that Porsche with a good driver mod. 😘
Pls do a nother rimac nevera Race
Porsche will beat rocket 🔥🔥
That Porsche driver is the biggest cheat the the history of carwow drag races. So annoying
Pity you didn't have the latest 911 Turbo S! 10s all day, every day!(I'm not a 911 fan but shit you've got to respect the latest 911 Turbo's performance!)
That Porsche driver was cheating at every chance he got and still took a huge L and looked like a lard doing it. What an ass and I wouldnt want my 911 tuned by them if it over heats that quick and still cant beat a stock engine r8.
I'd buy a 911 Turbo S and be happy with 10.1 sec 1/4 mile drags 😇
That porsche driver is just straight up cheating.Dont have him back in Carwow.
I’ll take Audi if I had money, Looks like real weapon
We need to see Skyline R34 vs Toyota Supra mk4
These against "an absolutely untuned" Tesla Model S Plaid. That would be devastating. For whom?
What is with that Porsche driver & getting Level   I think that guy is flexing off his tunning skills bigtime
7:04 WTF PORSHE?!???!!!!??
Hahah like video games. Car nowdays all complicated 🤣
So what did this teach us? Porsche with almost twice the horsepower isnt twice as fast and dosn't function even twice as good. "Just buy" the regular Turbo S and you can do this all day with warranty intact + you wont need a motorupgrade...
This was one of the best videos mat was scared amazing more videos like this
It’s so funny that yanni is one of the few car guys out there who has hardly any clue about cars 😂😂. „Can you put it sports mode“. Love this guy
OMG!!! This is one of the mental & craziest drag race I was waiting for a long time!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
ES MOTOR is the best🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷
As fast as an sf90 and it doesn't even have launch control 😶
Tuned cars are like ED. Always an excuse.
Yianni: Uuaaaaaaaa
R8 would’ve won or it would’ve been closer if the Porsche didn’t cheat
Think mayne the porsche drive shouldn't do any more carwow videos. Made it pointless
That’s Arthurs ttrs he’s the man
Porsche driver was cheating at the roll race events that LLF attended too. Always going early
Best video YET, more fast tuned cars please, its interesting seeing them have heat issues or any such problems.... and when they work well really exciting to watch.
Porsche is only 4 tenths quicker than stock. Not a great upgrade.
Rays a damn cheat
9.4 that’s insane
dudes , that was one of best and worse drags you ve ever made , the roll race wasn't fair and the drag wasn't on its full potential , still gave me chicken skin
Anybody else likes this formula? drag race at last?
How is it possible that 2.5L pumps out 1100hP and 5.2L does 1200hP with twin turbskies, meth and all that... 🧐 I know you can't calculate 2 times the hP with twice the displacement but still. On the other hand 1100 out of 2.5L is pure nuts 😁😁
This has to be literally the best drag race on carwow, there were emotions, happy and sad, angry and disappointing emotions, cars with the probably most horsepower to ever shown in a carwow video, the hole vid felt like a movie actually  ( sry for my english ) Well done carwow👍🏼👏🏼
Moral of the story ....buy a 911 turbo s and leave it alone .
Keep redoing your homework until you get a pass mark! 🤣 Honestly you guys......
Those turbos kick in like vtec, the porsche driver was in his own world 😂
Now Tuned BMWs would do 😩😩
Footage of the Porsche doing its sound check was a cut-away shot. Looks like another thing to add to the list that the driver stuffed up.
Yannis face 😄😄crushing u mat
shit cars
this video was a mess haha
It’s amazing that these cars with built engines well over 1100 horsepower are as fast as a stock 765lt lmfao
Matt is this is quality 😂
Do a jam version like 1000 hp mk4 supra 1000 hp r34 1000 hp evo 1000hp rx7 it would be epic est drag race
i love this can you heart my comment plz ( can you do all corvette race)
Thats one of the best drag races in the channel so far! Goosebumps for how mega quick those cars are!
But that Porsche is super fast man
Volkswagen won🤣🤣🤭
Meh, this could have been a good video, but all the races were fcuked up. 😒 So it's a waste of time.
M5 comp. Vs M5 CS please...
awesome content please make a review of that tuned 911
Won't be inviting that Porsche back 😂
Never bring back the driver in that porsche
Guys stop talking shit about that porche driver ... I can’t like them all
Don’t invite those cheaters again.
Mad fail for Porche driver  :(
With the thousands of high performance cars that mat has driven you know the car is fast that’s he is driving when his face changes and looks scared 😂
That was amazing brother.
Should’ve brought the m8 hmm hmm (bmw fanboys)
Admit it, we were all happy for the race between Yianni and Matt!
Bruh moment
Best like always Mat number one 🥇🏅👍👍
Am I the one who is mad the porsche did almost everything wrong?
What a pair of prima donnas lol, it's not me it's the car said everyone else who can't do it either  😋
So the r8 is 1st on the drag race leaderboard
Moral of the story, don’t tune your car 🤔😂😳
Ray was fucking useless
Fuck the stats
But a standard 992 Turbo S does 10.1 ?
One of the best videos you have ever made!!!
Ngeri, kancang bana...
Amazing.
That was both amazing and insane! Proper 10 seconds cars!! Fast and furious, eat your heart out! Toretto would be proud!!🤣
All these modified performance tests just shows what a huge waste of money they are
Who the hell is that Ray Guy what a shit bloke ruined it.
So the audi R8 is the king of the carwow drag race right ? Why u not give the R8 title of carwow drag race🤔 ?
Where BMW M5 1000HP?
The porsche couldnt have cheated in any race No
The one with the Porsche car cheated on the brake test
That was just bonkers
This is insane 💥💥💥🤣🤣
Innit
Author's ttrs
Yes!! All the stats on the screen side by side!
Nasty machines
Porsche driver couldn’t cheat any harder if he tried
I didn't know Carwow was racing rockets
The guy in the Porshe is the most stupid driver in all carwow videos
That TTRS redlining sounds mental !
The tt is the shame of tuning.There are a lot of ttrs with such power which  are very functional not lag not anything.
The first ever tuned porshe used in Carwow ig
Trop de chevaux, trop de dixièmes perdus d'un démarrage à l'autres...en lancé, la porsche vient déjà.....lancée donc que retenir de ce test.....rien.
Tesla Plaid Roadster will dominate these slow cars.
I don’t know when y’all will understand, but the Porsche is too good to be beaten, just like what happened in the rolling race. It started last still it was well ahead of them all.
I'm not happy with the Porsche man on rolling races... Otherwise I enjoy your videos Matt
පිස්සු හැදෙන සද කිවුවලු ...
Break boost cars when roll racing
I love this race ❤️
mat just racing with himself twice 🤣
8:46  me everyday realizing german engineering just killed something with higher power output  amazed, happy and wtf all rolled into one
This race was really freaking amazing but u know what if they just had the chance to bring the evolve m5 .... ut would’ve been a whole new level Edit : that porche guy ray or whatever that is just a sore loser .... dont even bother him there or like yanni says ... what porche ? 😂😂
D' audi ti**y ars*
Best of drag races
That ray guy is a shit driver replace him
These are really quick cars but it would have been a better duel had you included the Tesla S Plaid...hell, you might have had some of your mates sat in the passenger seats at the same time 🤪
I thought the ttrs will cause most of the problems, followed by the Porsche and then the R8, am really surprised by the ttrs.
Nothing can beat that porche lol
Best drag race in a long time!!! The way that R8 just shoots off is unreal - I think I made a mess in my pants as well
Nothing can beat that porche lol
That Porsche driver is bloody abysmal
I want this TT i don't care about brakes
Living life Fast boi
The guy driving the Porsche sucks like hell 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
Mat obviously not adept to drivin 'tuned' cars :P
That Porsche guy cheated in every single one of them 😂
And like always the Porsche wins everything!
11:55 this face XD
You need to wake up to the fact it’s a EV world and your just showing contempt for the environment
Who wants the Rimac?
Too many tune car
A chaotic episode, highly entertaining never the less 😃
Everyone is looking at the Audi, whereas the Porsche just flew past everyone.
Jesus. Never bring the driver of the Porsche back! Never kept in line and jumped almost every start
This was all over the place but fun 😁
Where all yall  *delusional ricers who always think "Tuned" 1000hp Supra, 1000hp GTR, and 1000hp BMW beat stock Porsche/Audi anyday* at? I wanna see your so called 2000hp cars beat these cars.
Great race !! More content like this 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
That evolve tune in M5 is so much value for money when you compare this tunes.
Mad tuned 1100hp 991 Turbo S :  1/4 mile 9.7 sec Stock 992 Turbo S with warranty : 1/4 mile 10.0 sec Porsche did some awesome magic wizard stuff with the new model.
10:43, now how many brothers does Yianni have?
plz do a race with tuned bmw🤩🤩
Basically Matt was racing himself the whole vid😂😂
That Porsche guy is a cold blooded cheater and a party pooper
R8 is a weapon!! Cheapest mods and best 1/4 mile time. If I had to pick it will be the R8
This is the craziest video ive seen from Carwow! I also drive cars like these, but in Forza ;D
Yianni was determined to win that drag race, the way he celebrated😂
I've watched every car wow video ever made and hands down this one is thee most exciting video for sure I thoroughly enjoy this. wow just wow. car wow!
Tuned cars should be driven by their owners. It's always the same crap, "oh it wouldn't launch" or "oh it wouldn't shift"
The Porsche driver was cheating in everything including not partaking in the drag race....🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Spoiler alert- The Volkswagen won.
rimac nevera vs bugatti chiron maybe
The tuned drag races are the best 🤣🤣
The porch driver is shitty
That TT sounds like the old S1 Quattro rally car. Absolutely mad thing.
Is the porsche driver good? He does not want to be level with anyone
That Porsche was just there to mock them while rollin😆
The best drag race ever That TT is crazy
Turbo s cost £160k new 1/4 10.1. £70k investment not worth it as 1/4 is 9.7 R8 cost £110k new 1/4 10.8 £40k investment worth it as 1/4 is 9.4. TTrs no doubt worth the investment.
Do more man!
I love the fact that yianni is now basically co presenting every drag race
Check out their instagram, so that we could see more of these cool drag races with insanely tuned cars/vehciles.
Porsche 👎
Where is the m5 (1000hp)  We need the same race but with the m5 next time
5.50 mat reaction
Take a Underground Racing R8 please🤷‍♂️
Great video, love the continuous effort and focus on content 👍🏼
Omggg that Porsche driver just ruined it. Talk about cheating 🤦🏾‍♂️
The Porsche guy is so annoying
That Porche got hot from two pulls? Don’t feel like a serious tuning company if they didn’t the tune with larger radiators/cooling..
I loved it ❤️
Tuned cars a so rubbish.
The guy driving the Porsche needs to get backhanded.
That was a superb drag race
4:39 the way r8 just takes off 😶😶
If Jeremy Clarkson was reviewing  he would have said "that Porsche just f##ks off"
Porsche dumped Audi's ass ! 😂😂😂😂
Porsche is boss.
There is Tuning and then this.
Hate this kind of drag races
Race this R8 with the 1000HP evolve BMW
Bruhhh the Porsche did not know how to line up😭🤣 kinda annoying 😆
Yanny 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Another proof that heavily tuned cars are totally useless
Not getting the Porsche (that I don't own) tuned at ES Motors based on the cheating!!!
Porsche boxsterS  981 vs 718
Now i wanna see this 911 Turbo Against the M5 with 1500HP
That was dope 🔝🔝 I would like to see some amg tuned and ofc a old supra tuned versus a new one tuned.
10:13 thats burst 🤤
Get that guy out the Porsche he don’t know what he’s doing
First ever Porsche in Carwow which doesn't sound like vacuum cleaner
with almost twice the power the Porsche just beat the standard 911 turbo by 0.3s Wooow
Did Yanni have a pre workout drink and two cans of red bull before filming this ?
Sling shot mode Engaged
Yianniz reaction in the drag race was epic 😠
Iinnnit
This porsche guy is the biggest sus in carwow drag races history. I'm pretty sure underneath he is BMW guy.
❤
That insane👌🏼👌🏼
he said bonkers lmao
M5 1000hp👑
You should do the fastest time from each
9.7 is pretty bad considering the turbo s 650 bhp ist timed at 10.1 I bet a proper tune can bring it to the low 9 second range
They just ruined their cars lol
Audi r8 thats sounds CRAZY😮😮😮😮
The Porsche is both the beauty and the beast! More power to you Mat, bring us more of this.
Finally a race with an R8!
Matt please review THE NEW SHELBY GT 500
3:17 Matt had an exhuastgasm😂
This is the first time in ages I've seen Matt and Yanny proper excited
Can we get a tuned 911 turbo S Mar I am sure that car with 1000hp would be 8 second car
Gotta be the best sound check so far
That guy in the Porche has been on the channel a couple times now, but this guy cheats in every race he’s in. I mean both Yianni and Mat can be sneaky but this is not even funny anymore.
R8 without built engine yet the fastest
I want to see what a Kia Stinger 3.3 could do
it was  a v bad raceeee XD
Who else got annoyed by the Porsche driver,he was just not following any of the rules lol.
That tt looks so fun
When are we gonna see the McLaren 765LT ??? Would off been great to see it in this line up
Standard 911 turbo would do that all day everyday and only 0.3 seconds slower
Need to see prof green backk 💚💚💚
Gosh the Rimac did 8.6! I wonder how it would have felt!
Rubbish. Learn how to use the car BEFORE the video.....let me down Matthew
This dragrace is insane!
So basically,non of these cars can do the quarter in less than about 45 seconds? (by the time you've managed to find a mode where the shonky tunes actually work, the gearbox doesn't shit itself, and the driver manages to perfectly ace every input to the nearest millesecond..... ;-)
Bruh what is that porsche driver doing
Lovely race... Mat ...loved it
Great video lads! But the ads are ridiculous
I was wondering if one of them would get close to the Rimac Nevera but no chance :D
Regera's and chiron's battle is must
Porsche driver should be replaced if invited back. What a failure
Funny brummie
Porsche rolling race what a mess! Great vid anyways
Give the cars to their owners and then race again
Whoever is driving that Porsche…don’t invite him back
Awesome
When I first saw the thumbnail was like 😮
Yesss i like the lil cars specification slide
It's sad that our kids won't experience these cars because EVs have taken over....
Over 3000hp on the strip 🙆🏽‍♂️🙆🏽‍♂️
Nothing puts power out like a turbo Porsche! Tuned or not!
Aaaah the perfect German trio 😩❤️
So all that money spent on tuning and building but when you really need the cars to work they all don't work properly 🤣... Gotta love us tuners... We just love the idea of let's go again...
some editing problems in this one
Its a problem with the car mate.....its not me 😂😂
But still the Rimac Nevera is the quickest car ever, 8.6sec over the 1/4 mile!
We're not counting anything the porche did. Literally nothing was fair
So a standard 911 Turbo S make it in 10 seconds but a 1,100 HP makes it 0.3 seconds faster ? Don't need to tune that car then.
the audi tt sounds like the lamborghini huracan
No body is watching the Porsche 🙄😂
That was sooooo epic... 😢 😭 You guys are living the dream😆 Team Yianni 🙌🏽
i believe the porsche can do better
Race the 1,200hp Audi R8 against a Lamborghini performante
I love Yani!!!
Porsche driver 🚮
220hp per cylinder in the TT, absolute insanity
Yanni getting fired up makes me smile..
Funny how tuned to 1100 hp Porsche is only 0.5 sec faster than a standard one
Mad mad mad race 🤯
That Porsche be cheating the whole time, not even on the same level and stuff.
That Ray dude in the Porsche did not level in anything not even the brake test😂😂
Jas dice!
Alride matter. Grate. Lookat all the fast cars. No problem. Ido thing you’re screaming is very loud. Thereis aman whois able to be edit the movie ido witsch hewas sober no alcol or drags inis system then he wouldof perhaps taken screaming out. Blesswhat to thee.
can we have a drag race between the 1000hp BMW M5 and this tuned Audi TT RS I think it will be a banger
Please put Yianni into the Nevera :O
The guy of the Porsche was cheating! Don't invite him again.
They listen!!! The stats put together is much better. And it is easier to compare.
Ray in porsche don't know how to stay in level for brake test
Nice race love from india mat..
That Porsche driver has a mental capacity of a brick.
That's crazy mad 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Top 1914 ho by Remac nevera but fastest car 1600 ho nissan
when the tt comes on boost it is insane
Bad video/cars
Yanni is such a bad loser!
I know thid is irrelevant but -I always wonder why you don't turn off traction controll to rev up the "normal" audis? Idk - In my manual 2018 A5 if you turn off traction controll, you can rev it up.
I just wanna say that guy in Porsche is not cheating, with all this messing around while tuning ECU and engine there is quite a mismatch that a porsche (which is already at best config when coming out of the factory) can't handle and become very unpredictable. After tuning there is a learning curve for breaking and accelerating it's not linear making it unpredictable. As Matt said in the start the Porsche was tuned again in the morning itself hence making it even more unpredictable. He didn't know how much pressure to apply on the throttle to match the two cars. He could have applied a little bit more and Porsche will be blowing past the two and if it's a bit less it will be lagging. So the conclusion is the car has an unpredictable throttle response u should not declare anyone a cheat without knowing the reason
The Porsche driver sucks
Uhh has the Porsche driver EVER watched this channel before?????
Audi R8 NEW KING👑👑👑
Only missing gtr🥺
These guys can’t even drive an auto gearbox
My 2jz Supra that I have in Forza would have beaten them
Porsche pulling that UGR slingshot bullshit like it's TX2K. Car is fast, but for fuck sake learn how to line up properly
I have watched many of your videos but this one was my favourite.
Get a tuned 911 turbo S 992🔥
Whats wrong with the porsche? Is he scared that he could lose or what?
Bad look for es motor
the porsche driver cheated on everything man :D
never seen Yianni this serious about the drag...his game face was on alright!!!! awesome vid
12:21 look at yianny
The 5.2 V10 can handle 1200hp without a rebuild engine? What??? That's insane
Aslanlarim benim. Işte Türkün yapamiyacagi yokdur. TÜRKIYE
the guy is the porsche is not too bright
This feels like F1 😂😂😂
i just whatch this to compare with rimac unbeateble time
I thought it was Arthur's Audi TTRS. Nick's dad!
Three records in one race, madness
So this is how the German car won the rolling race.
What exactly happen ... stumps instead of hands 🤣 and first timers with that monsters that are not easy to launch. I like this type of videos and with Yianni we know we are going to have some extra funn 👍🙂
There's something about watching cars build boost dayummm that literally pumps my chest up.....
thanks for not giving up after one or two takes 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
CAMARO
Wait so the F90 M5 from evolve is no longer the quickest since that R8 got 9.4 (holy fuck)
Stuck in bed with corona. This is what I needed. Thank you 👊🏽
6:05 that porche is flying
I like the TT the most it just seems like such a riot to drive.
Another great commercial for tuned cars
The Guy in the Porsche is to dumb to drive the challanges correctly, the Porsch wasnt so much faster its because auf his incorrect driving
Big power is overrated, barely ever works, I’d be perfectly happy with 700 😂
Worst driver ever on carwow in that porsche 🤣
Porche always jumped everthing. Man he is cheating bloody hell. Cut this. Don't come to this channel ES MOTOR
When is running race between you and yianny Coming out?
There is now flipin way that r8 better than porshe
Ray F***ed up all the tests, is it that hard to level with the guys? cmn dude
the man with 911 cheated in rolling race and brake test  6:09 he's get back and start accelerating before 7:05 he stars slowing down
I enjoyed that vid. I was convinced that TT would brake down. £235k for the Porsche 🤯 sooner buy a brand new reliable turbo
M5 CS v GT2RS v new GT3
Klasen is the only company that knows how to build boosted Audis
Moron driving the porsche
Who writes these cars software?? It's not that hard to write a working launch control
The Porsche was cheating
Now that's what a race should give ya, drama!
What a hash off a video
Bruh every time yannie is in a Audi R8 it’s fucked up
The most scuffed tests to date🤣
Tesla model s plaid can do 9.24, even quicker than the tuned supercar, how crazy is that
The f is wrong with that porsche driver unbelevable could’nt just do 1 thing right
People always drool over 1000hp Supra, but the reality is you can get 1000hp out of any modern car build today. Even some sedans make 1000hp from the factory.  As they said in Florida street racing, the real game is getting to 2000-3000hp mark.
This 5 cylinders...sound of god
4:48 VTEC JUST KICKED IN !!!
Oh..my..god. That was pure insanity!
Value for money
Moral of the story,don't tune cars
9.9sec 2.5L single turbo car . Not baddd
Crazy video!!
Come on Ray….sort yourself out mate
3 amazing cars yet the most frustrating race I’ve ever watched 🤦🏾‍♂️
The Porsche though......
Ima have 2 dislike cuz the porche legit cheated on 2 races which annoyed me
Should've let Arthur drive the TT... then it would've won😂
Moral of the story = don’t tune your car
Behind the scenes
The only car that works is the TT! The Porsche can‘t do a second drag race 🤦🏼‍♂️ and yanni can not even launch the r8 within 3-4 times …this tuning cars are all crab, don‘t deliver only once!!!! So, go just normal with a 911 turbo s …can‘t get no better than that
Porsche was tuned - now the driver should be tuned
Wow whoever Ray is can’t do any of these right. Cheating at the rolling getting the jump cheating at the braking test. These results don’t count for anything. Test needs to be done fair again
High powered GTRs needed
That Porsche driver is horrendous😂😂the brake test he was behind which isn’t too bad because weather your infront or behind you’re braking at the same place so can’t really be cheated. But then rolling races are something else😂😂😂
7:21  When you’re out with your girlfriend and a 10/10 is passing by.
I thought that was Arthur's TT?
That TT RS is something else tho
Ай лайк ит👍
first day all 3 cars break the time record
911 driver was cheating or didn’t know how to race correctly
Conclusion : porsche guy isn’t able to follow the rules, accelerate from behind while rolling race, start decelerating before the line, second drag race, start way before the go
OMG THAT CRAZY!!!!!
Sprained my wrist clicking on this too quickly! Great video. 👏🏿
no ty, id rather have a stock 911, its better and consistent, damn, twice the power and barely 1s faster
Makes me never want to tune a car again lol…. Far to many gremlins
Germany is far away from the others !
Mental. Would I have any of them? God no.
The VW Group race on crack
Believe it or not, if there was a Plaid model S in the race, it would've beaten them all every time consistently while being a practical full size sedan. How incredibly is that?!
Porsche driver ruined this video with the amount of cheating he did.. they should fire him 😂😂
We need a re-do of this test. With a different driver. That Porsche driver is a cheat
That TTRS ❤️❤️❤️
lol that porsche shit
Guess that Porsche driver didnt really advertise his car very well, what a cheat. And also crapping out when the R8 got its sh*t together..
That 911 including its driver are rubbish.
The porsche driver was cheating every single time!!
Der beste Kanal den ich kenne
the porsche borat jumps and cheats every time....skam
(after seeing the race) when the speedometer crawls up faster than the tachometer... you know that's a fast car.
did the porsche guy left out of the last race because he's cheating too much?
That Porsche was a beast but the driver is absolutely hopeless.  Matt : Come on Porsche get  level get level  Porsche driver : ....................... (bugger starts to drop back even more)
Pause it at 10:44.. When you’ve pissed off some lads having a car meet at maccies
A lot of cheating by Ray... disgraceful
Ray was a cheat!
DRAG GTR PLS CARWOW
The fear on Mats face is enough to say that car is fast. Never seen him make that face.
That ES Motor driver is a cheat!!
the porsche cheated all day everyday
This shows one thing. Don't bother modifying cars, they just don't work.
Audi tt' s turbo lag  is like vtec in a civic
Said many times, the tuning is making the car slower. Factory setting is the best
Lmao who tf spends that much money on a damn tt
Matt had fun in that audi tt
This bettle driver is so bad
Such an interesting video. Four and a half minutes of talking later we get to see the drag race. WOW.
What a struggle are those cars... It looks like you need a f**kin degree just to get this thing moving..
Why when the audi TT RS revved up it sounded a bit like a wet fart
Hmmmmm, Tuned R8 vs Tuned M5?
The TT only did a 9.9? There's RS3's out there with 700hp that can do low 9's and the Iroz 1300hp RS3 in America that's went into the 7's albeit with drag tires. Maybe it's the boost curve and it just spikes.
Tuned cars just ain't worth the agro
Great video but Yianni needs to shut up and listen sometimes. He should of let the owner drive.
I'd love to see more drag races with tuned cars, feels way more exciting, as you really can't predict what's about to happen!
Is it only me or does anyone miss "The Tug of War??"
GET LEVEL RAY!
where is the new c-class rewiew
That Porsche driver is the biggest cheat in the history of Carwow. Every single round he cheated. Its a shame cos the Porsche probably would have won anyway. No need! 🤷‍♂️
That r8 is mental
Most amount of total horsepower ever in a carwow dragrace? ☺
Ray is a cheat
Mat can you do a drag race between tuned 2013 mercedes cls 63 amg and bmw m6 gran coupe??☺the stock one will be good too.
Best video so far
Ray can't drive or he's a blatant cheat! lol
Mat: "Hi! How are you?" Me: "Well Mat, I'm... Mat: "Mat Watson here from Carwow...." Me: 🤐😒
That Porsche driver was cheating hardcore
On screen stats are the way to go Matt. Glad you’re listening. It much better for us viewers 👌
No launch control and still the fastest in the drag? Top tier racing Yianni
Carwow should make a top tier list of the fastest cars like in Top Gear
That guy did porsche wrong..
Hey Carwow, can you do a video about a corvette Zr1 against a Chevrolet Zl1?
Why would anyone tune a Porsche it's already quick
Can you pls race a Chevrolet corvette c8 vs 3.0 liters toyota supra  Pls make it happened Im your fan from Philippines
you can notice how serious yanni is when its about winning or losing hahaha GGWP xD
One of the intense video from carwow!!!!!!!!
it was great race 👍👍
Supra with 700 hp: Hello
hey matt, are you purposely disrespecting porsche's name
typical everyone races until yanni wins?
Enjoyed ,how yianni wanted to prove the audi owner that his car is no joke and that he can prove it ❤️⚡
WTF is up with the driver of the Porsche !!??? This video needs a do over
R8 THE BEST
Atleast the EAuDi won! Lets gooooow
The Porker driver is a complete muppet. Geezer can’t even Rev it or get level in a race. Never get him on again, Mat.
Ray doesn't know what level means. Cheated on the break test big time.
The TT is the Moral Winner here !
Love it
You should had the m5 with 1000hp here
Oh my god Yanni was soo pissed
Wtf was that Porsche driver doing 😂
Wow that tt rs😂
Been waiting for this for a long time😇
In the sound test, the porsche cheated. They put in B-roll of a previous encounter!!! Lool
Ttrs a r8 best 😎 Bettle this power 😂🖕
Summary: Porsche in your peace and love vs audi's leading with yours common problems. 😂
that Porsche driver kinda sucks lol
Hats off to the owners for letting them do this or drive the car themselves. Great job.
Laurel can be such a baby if things don't go his way!
The driver in the porsche seriously???
Didn't know Edward Norton is into tuner cars nowadays.
Each of the cars are having their own individual race on drag strip.
A tuned car race 🤩🤩🤩
Man, cars tuned to this level are rubbish
shit race, frustrating to watch. evolve bmw vs turbo s was more epic.
Maybe get cars that are actually properly sorted next time 🤣
Need a rematch when the cars are sorted out
What a farce, how embarrassing for the Porsche tuners.
I love the porsche, but oh my god the driver...
PORsCHE💙
Three Germans automobile giants tuned by British and driven by extraordinary personalities 🔥😂
The ”Ray” guy is sooo bad he can’t even keep level with the others, somebody else should drive his car
😂🔥the Porsche is destroying the cars
Porsche always wins
Ray deffo cheated on the break test. He was a good 10 feet behind everyone else from the get go
When you have the fastest car but still cheat 😂💀
Race these car again with yanni... come onn we need a rematch 🤩🔥❤
I will only like your video if you will do r8 drag race
Porsche the real winner
Nuts 🥜
Damnnnnnn enough horsepower to destroy the tarmac
Jeez if you told me the guy in the porsche did his first drive ever in a car i would believe it,  dct's and launches so many problems when tuned, you don't have these problems in a manual after 10 tries you can finally prove your the fastest.😂
TT RS sound reminded me a lot of the Group B Quattro. Just needs a bigger *WHOOOSH*.
For me the TT sounded the best, by far.
Porsche constantly cheating
Porsche driver sucks
THE NEW Car wow king the R8
ES MOTOR 🇹🇷 🇹🇷 🇹🇷
(before watching the video)... anyone expecting the TT RS to blow up?
yianiis expressions are priceless🤣
The most problematic video from carwow🙃. Still it was fun😌
Proper respect to editing crew ! That was  done well!
Damn this was fun!
Huge hole of torque “lag” then
Best drag race yet, guys! Love these after-market mix-ups.
what is thissss
Insane
Porsche guy was kinda cheating all the way till the drag race haha
Driver mods required for when you do these high powered races haha nothing ever goes smoothly 😂
Race Germany🇩🇪🏁
Was the porsche driver driving with a playstation controller ? He took 1 hour to rev his car and he was never level 😂
We want audi r8 (1200 bhb) Rimac navera drag race
Porsche guy doesn't know what get level means🙄cheat!!
Not a Single race gone according to plan.
Cool race. Matt vs yianni vs ashville 👍🏾
That was insane, more please lol
12:07 , no doubt about it, Yanni is possessed.
10:45 looks like yianni is about to be mugged with everyone approaching hoods up 😆
Porsche driver a cheater. 🤣🤣. Fly-by on rolling races and break test he was slow to the line.
always have trouble with launches. Come on Yianni, wtf is going on with your pedal foot bro? LOL
I’d have the TT but I think I’ll get a bigger brakes fitted if I’d own it
Porsche is a total cheat. Rolling races and brake test. Ended up bottling it at the end as he knew Yanni would have won. Keep the Porsche driver off the channel
Oh man, this is one of the best/funniest races you have done so far 😂
This Porsche driver is driving me nuts! Such an annoying behaviour
Even if the porshe was behind it fucking moves
Carwow I think new world record
That Porsche driver is an absolute trash man
MAT : play us the "Girl from Ipanema" song when showing the stats : loved your - "pause it nów : NÔW!"😁
Wow, what a race!
We needed a Nissan GTR here
The guy on the Porsche ruined the whole video. Is he stupid or something? First rolling he cheated by getting a run up and not being in the highest gear. Second rolling he just started accelerating from behind way earlier that everyone. Brake test, started braking way earlier. In the Second drag race he jumped. Then he was saying his car was hot and didn't want to cool it. Jesus what a loser
We want more of these, those cars were mental
model s plaid can beat that
The audi finally had a victory
Congratulations, you got top three fastest cars in the history or carwow...
Those quarter mile numbers and all the shifting issues tell me that as far as these cars go it's better to leave them stock.
Who tunes a 911 S? Love it!
The porshe driver was rubbish
Next time please get someone in the Porsche that doesn't constantly cheat...
Nest video: Devel Sixteen vs Bugatti La voiture noir drag race
Porsche = Cheating on rolling races.
Could it be possible to repeat the video with a nice driver in the Porsche and not a 15yo kid who thinks his car “is the best” so he cheats in every single test? It was a shame having that amazing cars and not having fair results because of his behavior. At least get that in mind for next time, Mat and Yianny amazing btw!
Audi R8 seems to have some complete rubbish software...
4:40 Yianni was like woaaahhh🤣
The old 911 looks so much better than the new one
More more more of these it's so fun to watch
the porsche dude sucks at this
This video says a lot about tuned cars
Please race the Dodge SRT charger Vs the SRT challenger
Wish I had either money so I can make my car more unreliable
A good advertisement to leave tuned cars alone and go with what the manufacture does
This drag race is so intense
Why did the Porsche guy cheat every time in the rolling races....
Turbo s for me
RS3 vs Golf 8 R
Respect for the top-level filming and editing, really top class! Comparable with Top Gear, the old one. It was tense and breathtaking to watch.
Would really appreciate it if you guys do a race between the R8 in this video and the new Rimac Nevera
Dammnn hot race 🔥🥵
tf was the guy in the porsche doing
BRUHHHHHHH 😤😤🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️ 1. Don't bring back the driver who was in the Porsche. 2. Just have the tune cars be driven by their owners.
The porsche guy is just cheating😂
9.4 is the fastest car of carwow ?  Except rimac
RS3 VS GOLF 8 R!!!!!
Please race the new X6M Vs old X6M
I'm an Audi fan and i am very happy that R8 won by beating the porsche😂
This channel is like 90% Porsche, BMW, AUDI and Merc's.
This video was as manic as those numbers would suggest.
Lmao .. a little sketchy xD
More tune cars viedio plase ❤️
This new format made me watch the whole video and i didn't regret it 😂
i think The Porsche maybe quicker than R8 because the Gearbox...but the TT RS got more light than the Porsche
Review Tesla S Plaid Mat
Piss Ray off he has no idea.
ES Motor Stock 📉📉📉
Tesla without any problem be doing 9.25 . Mad
I swear the tuned cars just never work right.  Something always blows or its missing brakes  or the owner cant get level 🤣
the tt brakes is exactly what we used to end up with early millennium . Fucking about with cars making them fast but always forgot the brakes😂.
Incredible
Who is driving the Porsche he is so lost
Porsche driver is an idiot. No race was fare
The guy in the Porsche cheated in everything except the standing drag. So dissapointed :D
That was bedlam!
Who's driving the Porsche??  Come on mate....
Porsche cheated on most tests
Impressive the R8 can take all that boost with stock internals. People talk about the 2JZ, but this is amazing
Arthur's  TT is no joke
Porsche driver is a cheater👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
PORSCHE needed a better driver.. we should be talking about how it smashed the other 2  and not how he cheated
Might be a great car but that Porsche driver was shit hahaha
Tuned cars can be seriously fast... at those rare moments when they actually work.
Oh, another 10+ minute "drag race" video. Pass...
Can you have a dragrace with just busses?
You can do what you want, the Porsche is the Benchmark ... when i see how problem-free it performs and how fast it is, how fast it starts etc. ... there is no other car on the planet performing like that. The Porsche was always in the lead. It is the best sportscar on the planet.
100,000 pounds to make your car undriveable and extremely fragile. No thanks
Porsche cheated on every single challenge!! He was all mouth from the start and then cheated to make sure his mouth wasn’t lying 🤥
The levels of cheating from the Porsche was biblical 😂😂😂
Porsche to its driver-That's what you get for cheating😂
Seems like now we getting more and more 10 seconds cars.
Still slower than the Rimac, wich will not break every launch control haha :D
the guy in the Porsche must be fired. liked he cant even keep a car level like wow
ESmotorss... onlar bir türkk... <3
MATT pls post the bloopers seq
That was explosive 👌👌👌
That Porsche driver is a moron... like, how hard is it to follow basic instructions?
Mat randomly flooring the TT is what we needed to see
Ray didn’t really get!
1000hp things😏
British clowns: Let's tune out cars. German manufacturers: Let's get the popcorn for this comedy
this is madness
11:54 the face that gives you +100hp
That 911 driver needs sacking man
they always upload when I am about to eat
Porsche drive cheated a lot😁
Imagine spending all that money on cars that don't work. One can't stop and the other can't go
What a mess!
I was not expecting the 911 to be this rubbish. The owner clearly knew about the overheating problem that's why he kept backing off the drag race.
Is it really that hard for that absolute buffoon of a driver in that Porsche to JUST STAY LEVEL HOLY SHIT
11:02 Stupid Matt
Sorry, but the Porsche driver made that video very annoying. Rolling race from the same level... yeah of course. Brake test was as hilarious.
at first, the comment i expect: " tuned cars succccc " reality: " *porche driver succccc* "
ASS MOTORS porsche is nice
Try lambo 1100+ hp. There is one in Kyiv
The stylers froelanys sparhazeint🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪🏁🏁🏁🏁🏁🏁🏁🏁🏁🏁🏁🏁🏁🏁🏁🏁🏁🏁🏁🏁🏁🏁🏁🏁🏁👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Carwow is now going to next level 💯💯
Keep level Ray!!!!
porsche kills everything EVERYTIME !
If ever there was an advert for not spending tens of thousands on tuning a car.
*sat in an audi.. "now let's move to the audi.." wait wut
Porsche driver is a cheat, and doesn't do the car justice.
whoever was driving the Porsche was definitely under the influence of something
Thats the other side of high tunned cars, absolutely no stability
Who the feck is driving that 911…
Awesome video, the TT RS sounds amazing.
Ok, don’t ever let this Ray guy drive again. 😄. He could not stay level for nothing. Jumped the start on the drag 😂. Your mom would have done much better.
Finally he tested a modified ttrs
That was absolutely bonkers....🤪🤪
That R8 Vs Rimac
Was the Porsche driver dumb or just relaxed and confident ??
I am the only one who fast forwards until the race starts
imagine owning all this
Not a good advert for ES was it!
Energy is insane!!! More plsss
Porsche driver was a joke!
I hate modified cars. They just keep breaking down and being ridiciolous. Why do you need this kind of power in a road car. You won't go on a motorway because ride is propably rubbish and after 10 minutes you will have a head ache. They are useless on track because they cannot  handle the amount of power and they are likely to crash. See how that TT struggles to put down the power in lower revs? These tuner cars are utterly useless! Don't change something that works beautifully!
Matt Teach Him What Level Is And You Know Who 🤣
Remember the time when the 10sec barrier was unbreachable
This was actually a waste of time.
The porche have problems it's why is cheating , lesson I learn? Well Vag cars are crap, tunning even worse
That 911 is rocketing off🔥🔥😍
Yes yes yes🖤❤💙
Question - should you not be wearing helmets for this kind of stuff!? You’re doing 200mph in what are essentially racing cars…
Porsche driver is a complete crook
Let drive who knows how to drive the tuned car
Holy shit a TT with 1100 hp??
The timing is bonkers 🔥💯🤑
We want Tesla plaid
Love the way Matt reassures everytime by revving up to redline and then signals if he's ready😂
What happened to Arthur, since it's Nick's now?!
Well Best race so far, I wish they race that 1000Hp M5 with these
You guys are amazing
Again get the normal drivers in the driving seats.
595 abarth review plsss
Porsche ich Liebe ihn einfach
The sounds cars were making like jets engaged in a dogfight 😁😁
Nah, I think that Porsche is faster than the R8. But nice race.
Porsche guy is lame.
Why the driver in the porsche is not copentitive
Best race!
Porsche driver acting real brand new he's the kind of guy that it's impossible to street roll race correctly
Wow
All 3 are absolute weapons , when they actually work 😩🤯
Easily one among the best videos
Some people say tuned cars are rubbish they get broken often... But guys heve you seen so many emotion in any other cars😅
Do a car giveaway mate... Not a collabo with omaze 😉...  Something like; Matt: Hi how are you, Matt Watson here from Carwow and I'm  "sat" in a giveaway Lamborghini Aventador SVJ and the delivery man would be..... Guess who?..... Yianni from Yiannimize...
What's wrong with the Porschedriver?
Porsche driver was useless
Yianni"s expressions are priceless👍
Please, next time, bring a driver that actually knows how racing rules work. Such amazing cars and such a bad driver in the Porsche.
The TT is my favourite. Immediately.
Under 10 second cars , awesome race
Tunes cars need work
On all rolling races the Porsche wasn’t level and it was building speed before “Go”- and boost. Same on breaking. Why can’t you have a camera shot from the rear to show the lights and who started breaking before the line?
What is the problem with the Porsche driver ?!
The guy in the porsche is a doughnut 😂
Imagine wasting almost 100k on power upgrades the car can't even handle 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
90 grand to make the Porsche go 0.4 seconds faster
Every drag race, there are half time in talking shit and poor joking.
awesome cars
Yeah, Yianny is still here he sort of lightens up the mood of Carwow.
Would like to see drag races of some normal compact suv like kia soul, hyundai creta. I dont knoe if these cars are available in your region. But its the mostly available ones in the  middle east
Whoever thought this would be a technical race, I feel bad for you 🤣
chinko……4:06、4:13
The Porsche revving was in a totally different place lol.
FKIN L
Yiani = Serious face
lets goo videos at 1 45 am in ca
That R8 is insane
Is this the highest average hp for a drag race on this channel? Because 3400 hp is a lot of power!
No point doing these with bad drivers
anddd im expecting that theyre gonna take these bloody car and race with a motobike or gp or bennett racing bike
All that money on a stupid TTRS and a 911 992 will give it a good run for it’s money and would brake better. Anyone with Plaid comments - it’s been tested and only runs a 2.7 to 60 and a 10.2 quarter . They have been recalled. Kyle from 1320 video has done a 8.8 sec quarter mile with more or less the same power , so Rimac, is out lol
I never clicked this fast 🤣
2jz with a small turbo closes these files
Clearly the Porsche doesn't understand the concept of "get level".
I think this is so far the best drag race ever on Carwow.
That TT is impressive 😂
What if you tuned those cars into 2500hp and 2500nm is it possible
Porsche driver cheated in every race. The dude dropped back enough to build boost ahead of you all..
That porsche just killed everyone. I just f*cking love that car.
How is that amatør drives that porsche
Great vid
guy in porche dosnt have a brain lol
did anybody else pause on the stats and then think 'this is gunna be a good drag race?'
Look's like the TT can hang out with guys Twice his age 💪, you getting what I mean ? All 3 cars are 10 second cars👽❤
That was madness
Bouch of shit cars, what's the point of tuning them this much so they dont work 100%?
This race is all over the place 😂😂😂😂
Next Video Pls a tuned 992 turbo s
Craziest drag race ever
You need to start using the owners as Yanni isn’t known for gear changes or the use of gears 😂😂😂
The only one to make a massive improvement on its standard 1/4 mile time is the TTRS , the tuned R8 and 911 have not made good bang for buck.  Great video still and Yanni’s facial expressions are hilarious .
U need to start showing some respect for the carowners and drop that radio. Driving with one hand its so unrespectful.
Think I'll stick with a 992 Turbo S and save myself the cash! Awesome race though.
I would have followed the Instagram for the blokes that built the Porsche if their driver didn't cheat so badly
Pretty slow compared to the stock Tesla family sedan Plaid that does the 1/4mile in 9.25sec
The porche is fire it just accelerates like a monster 👺
Please do 911 vs Tesla plaid next! Borrow one from Jay Leno. 😉
That's a new drag race record with 9.4 seconds!! Of course with heavy mods but stil..
Damn .. Porsche
11:56 that gives some extra boost to car
Mat, tuned cars aren't the problem... Highly computerized cars are. You never seeing a 2JZ Supra, Vtec Civic or LS3 having these problems.
That R8 is beautiful and £40k for the twin turbo setup isn’t so unreasonable. If they can map it for 98ron rather than ethanol it would be ideal as a daily.
The thumbnail looks amazing but when I watched the whole race, probably the wrost race I’ve seen on carwow. That Porsche driver is ASS. he cheated so many times
A Tiguan under warranty that doesn’t S##t itself every 5 seconds…😂 (& R8 for weekends)
Superb super cars
This was tuners drag racing
It’s such a shame the Porsche wasn’t driven properly, we all know it probably would’ve won anyway but now we can’t tell for sure
Is Porsche driver dumb or what? Kmt He cheated on everything!!
i didn't understand anything 😂😂😂
The porsche driver is just a bad driver!
Porsche cheating it's way up.
Not sure how this even went to air ray in the Porsche cheated nearly every time
Having cars tuned like this is just such a burden.
Where is the bugatti
That was brilliant, more of this please!
Any tuned Alfa?? Thanks mate
what good is a tuned 1000+ bhp if it cant go the distance. thumbs up to those who tuned the audis
I'd love to see a Model S plaid destroy all of these cars in a gentle manner as a family sedan 😂😂
Modified cars are a mess, a fast mess at that
It would be so fun if yanni and mat went to race track and raced each other
Why you dont try q50 3.0T red sport?? Its really powerful car
Finally got Arthur’s TT on here who else has been waiting ? 😂
Do supercharged vs turbo charged supercars with same hp
Ask Nick to bring down his GTR for a race.
This is the most problematic race carwow has ever had but very entertaining nonetheless😂😂
That porsche driver messed up every singel test. What's he doing?
That Porsche driver should be banned permanently from Your drag races
Do not ever get that guy in the Porsche there again. The car is an animal but almost every challenge he did something extra to get an unfair advantage with the second rolling race and the breaktest as the prime examples
Mat vs Yanni bicycle race pls pls
1000bhp bmw 1100bhp porsche and that mega r8 1200bhp  would be a epic race and 1/2 mile race
My guy in the porsche really didn't want to lose his job, that's why he cheated 🤣
Carwow how do you allow Matt to act like a fool, he’s not being funny he’s legit act so stupid and corny
Porsche driver was a cheat. Im not even interested in it now. Those audis were insane!
10 outa 10 for yanni manualy launching that 1000hp monster and winning thats some propper driving right their
Pleasee fly to US and try the S Plaid vs everything you're going to smoke off. I enjoy the drag race video only from carwow.
Rocky's gtr Vs the R8
What a bunch of mental car!!!🤯
Personally, one of the worst shot videos.  The races were poorly timed, the Porsche just kept cheating , all very rushed.
Porsche driver was a joke, not level on any race and kept stopping on the drag races then the car overheated. ES motors your driver let your car down!
Nice nowing Mathew. Hahahhaha I know your mad driving skills will keep you a 1/4mile at a time.
Whats the porsche dude doing?!?!?
porsche driver = cheater
The king : *Porsche* 🌟
I tought he liked to sit in the newest car
Please do a rematch and put Yianni on the 911
All of these cars have ties to VW.
I was expecting the porsche to win. Although it seemed like the owner or driver was scared. Seemingly cheating the rolling race and brake tests then absent from the drag race... Hm 🤔
That guy driving the Porsche must have been having an off day...
Guys next time give the owners who KNOWS the car the chnace to race.
1:50 finaly! :)
Please do Tuned Mclaren 765LT with downpipes vs 1100hp audi r8 vs bmw m5.
That porsche just cheated in rolling races. Not being in line so when they started he was already faster than them
Blood still runs from our ears as Mat pronounces the word PORSCHE. Apparently, learning the correct pronunciation of the brand name is too difficult for him.
Looks like high power turned cars has too much problems waste of money
Dude in the porshe couldn't do anythng right, not the sound check, rolling race, staying leveled for the break test 🤦‍♂️
Mans in the porsche be cheating heavy 🤣🤣
The r8 owner is my uncle and I go to his workshop all the time 👍
That Porsche came strictly for promotional reasons. Couldn’t even get level for a start.
For future tuned car episodes, can consider let each car's owner do a race!
THIS IS THE MOST EXCITING VIDEO IN A WHILE
Yanni doing the "I can't hear you" Gesture to the Porsche on the wrong side. Wonderful.
Carwow Indonesia upload please
Porsche driver needs a slap for cheating every bloody time 🤣
The turbo lag on the TTRS is ridiculous 🤣
the moment Yanni sits close to the steering u know he's gonna fuck up 😆
This is the most serious race ever..🔥🔝
Bring a Lancer evolution X
This was the most anticipated *"so what exactly happened"* in a long while haha
porsche guy cheated in every test lmao
Ray in the Porsche needs to stop cheating. Wasn’t level in the brake test and launching way to early in the rolling race. Deserves the penalty DNS.
"get level, get level" the Porsche takes a run up 2 times. Eh?
mat was having way too much fun in that ttrs 😂
Poor performance from the Porsche driver! Wasn’t a fair race what so ever!
Man that was tense...
Reasons why I would never have performance upgrades visually explained. Good watch though 👍🏽
The Porsche driver cheated in like every race+😑
Why does yanni look like donky kong doing the last race ☠️ why so mad when he won ☠️
Can you do a car review of the 2005 Ford gt
That was intense! 😂
*Yiannis serious face*😂😂😂
https://youtu.be/cmJRxT1POJg
The 911 driver is what we call in the business of racing a CHEATER. In every test. 😂
Perfect receipt for burning the warranty and destroying reliability
Why spend so much money tuning the car and turn out unreliable on both road and track?
After Rimac Nevera this toys are funny to watch :)
Yannis face in that last race.. game face on🔥 you knew he was gonna win 🤙
I was blown away by the 911s but now they’re drag racing 9 second cars.... carwow keeps delivering
Was Never very impressed by Janni, so this doesn’t surprise me.
Every time I open Porsche video I get a Porsche taycan add 😂
Fast & Furios recap channel
Es Motor gurur duyduk, çok güzel iş …. 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷
The driver in 911: what is level,  I'm on top level 😂😂
In a real drag race the car never gets a second chance. These highly tuned cars are as reliable as a Fiat Punto.
Can u race a45s vs rs5
Please please find a ecu only tuned 911 turbo S
Ray keeps cheeting!
The Porsche was so far back during the brake test even before they got to the line 😒
This is a Tuner Showdown!!
The Porsche cheated hard in everything. Why tune your car that much if you not going to trust it to win
Don’t tune cars especially if you’re poor.
These may be expensive, but actually they're really good value in a way- in terms of £ per hp all of these are cheaper than a totally unspecced base Fiesta ☺
Why don't you just let the owners drive? They lent you the cars yet you invite other drivers to drive them and just have the owners wait and barely come on camera.
That TT is NUTS!
I think the porsche driver said his temps were through the roof so nobody could see the r8 spank him! Its not as quick as he says it is. Complete bullshitter
Rimac nevera vs telsa roadster
what a race🥶🥵
The driver in the Porsche is horrible
First MK2 TT appearance in carwow?! 8J bois leggo
Porsche is a beast every time
sheeeeeeeesh
Insane
The drivers should have been replaced by the car owners themselves
This Porsche driver is driving a Porsche while not driving a Porsche. - He did litereally everything wrong you can do wrong :D
Love that 911 colour!
Am just in love with that TT
ahhhh yes yes yes
Arthurs Audi !
What a soundcheck!
We need more Drag races with cars over 1000hp!
The new Porsche 650hp 850nm 1/4 mile time: around 10.2sec. 1100hp Audi TTRS 9.9sec
I saw the palpitations in Yanni
Race starts at 7:40
We need these cars against the evolve bmw (1000hp)
Day 34: “Have we already named Rimac in our video?” “Yes” “Good”
As always Porsche wins 😀
Porsche kept cheating 😅
So then, what exactly happened : "Yanni with his basic immature driving skills ruined this drag race event."
Carwow and Saturday mornings!
Ah Arthurs audi TT is complete!
This was funny but man tye rolling races and the break tests were a joke. Good watch anyways.
Ray cheated in the brake test and rolling
What all these drag race videos teach us: you go with Porsche - you have 0 problems.
Please just stop bringing this ridiculously tuned cars... It's boring to see that they can't start and drive properly
During the brake test the Porsche slowed down before he got to the line, so that was cheating/an unfair result.
Rubbish cars, rubbish video
Audi R8 V10 ♥️
4:47  When "VTEC" kicks in.
Tuned cars can be messy
All that tuning and yet a standard Porsche Turbo S 992 does a quarter mile in 10 seconds.
Lol , Porche cheating I see once or twice. Nice race though.
" A whole bunch of torque" interesting number Mat😂😂
First
Moral of the story: keep ur car stock
Excited af
The blue on that porsche, mmm
Nice one, we only saw "Nick" briefly. Thank fuck.
Please do review of GLS63S
My god, these are my favourite cars 😍
Porsche driver need to know what G E T   L E V E L  means.
Flippen Awesome race this That Audi is super quick 9.4 mind blowing
Nowadays 1000hp has become so common that after reading 600hp on a car feels like meh.
The porsche kinda cheated in the rolling race
Just shows how quick the new rimac is
Just love yiani expression when his car mess up, 🤣🤣🤣
That TT-RS is deadly quick, damn. Deff my fav
bad driver in porsche...
Matt: Get level get level porsche no way near 🤔 Surely can't be that difficult 🤔 Llf nick that thing is crazy🤪  yanny for the win👍
Yes I can eat my breakfast now
11:40 Yianni's passion is out of this world, love it 😂
Spoiler alert: VW group car won!
포르쉐 가 이길줄알고 온 1인
Where is Tesla model ⚡ plaid
Porsche the king of the road.
Great video mate , I hope my YouTube channel can grow one day so I can get a Audi R8 that’s my dream car
waiting for the chiron video
How the hell porsche lost this battle?? Too sadly..😶🙄😭😥🤕🥺😳
the audi r8 killed it in the sound test !!!
All 3 of them are wicked 💯🔥🔥
Siiiiiiiiiiiiiiick🔥🔥 Yianny sounding like Roman from fast and furious everytime he said "yeah"🤣🤣
Get rid of the Porsche driver lol
Need to get Ricky back with his new R35 build and compare it to his built M5
Those things are bonkers. Imagine Those 3 cars vs the Rimac Nevera & the Ferrari SF90 Stradale 🤯
The only time the Porsche finished the race, it messed up. Else, it would've won.
That's serious quarter mile timing!!!!
M5 evolve is not here 😥
tldr: tuning for that much power is just small pp energy and useless.
Best drag race yet 👍
The guy driving the porsche he abit slow like he been smoking weed before the race
More tooners!
Yesssss Arthur's ttrs!!!!!
That porsche guy has been cheating every race.. not good
This was MENTAL!!!  I was watching and I was just as excited as Mat 😅
Need a better driver in the Porsche
This was very exciting...good one lads
3:30 R8: FIREEEEEEEEEEEE
Porsche driver highkey a snake
I’d like to see tuned cars again and again!
that r8 is mental 💔
❤️
Are we just going to ignore how much the Porsche cheated?
So, tuned cars are faster than factory cars if you have all day to spend trying to make them work.
Crazy😮😮😮
Yianni's reactions are just priceless😂
Now this vs wrc cars. They would almost certainly I think loose but dang it would sound good. Or maybe they would win that’s why I want to see it.
Lol that Porsche driver might be the worst to have ever been in a carwow drag race
Day 3 of asking mat to review the sf90
Porsche all day everyday!!!!
The Porsche cheated  in brake  test and roll race
this vid is AMAZING!
Not interested in Tuned cars..
The Porsche couldn’t have cheated any more in the rolling race 😂
Damn , that Audi is crazy (both Audi's)
"I'mm sat in...."we miss that
4:48 mats face is like WTF JUST HAPPENED  The turbo: My time to shine bitch  Mat: OH SHIT HERE WE GO AGAIN
Mental cars them 🤣
Porsche cheated???
Ferrari SF90 Stardale vs Mclaren 765lt comeee onnnn
5 Cyl motors sounds soooo gooooood The tt did 9.9. stock new 911 turbo S do 10.1 with just 650. that is nuts
so it's... VW vs VW vs VW
do you have a chimp driving that porsche? not a single instruction was followed correctly
I love how the audi tt is tuned and doesnt have any traction issuess
Porche any day g
Where’s the CarWow deal to get cars like these? 😄
We are still waiting for Matt vs Yani running race :/
The Porsche is straight cheating isn’t it? 🌚
I’m going to Comment on every single video for the only porsche dragrace
Omg😍 use tt rs mk3 1000ch not 2. Good race
Matt: attends function Matt to all of the guests: Hi! Mat Watson here from carwow
Yianni chill OUT , that face at the end 😂😂😂😂😂
I clicked as soon as I saw a TTRS with 1100 hp
There u go porches owners I was on the porches page afew months back how they were laughing at the m5 competition  and audi rs3 that had a built motor breaking down in the drag race with the porches turbo s who's laughing now lol
That TT RS sound like It have a vtec
That r8 is mental!!
The Porsche guy didn't level with the Audis once lol
I fckin hate races like these, fckin tuned cars and their big problems
Mat get an iPhone
Third time asking for an ”only Porsche dragrace”, 718, vs 911 vs panamera vs taycan”
Show the stats like that in every video please !!! :)
That Porsche is the definition of "Can't Touch This"!!!!
That Porsche driver is absolutely useless.
Video Editor deserves a raise 😅 good job mate👍
Such an interesting race
The Porsche driver kept cheating by building extra momentum before before rolling races
"Hi, how are you? Mat Watson here from Carwow". That intro never gets old and gets everyone excited!
The Porsche driver is soo bad, he cheated at the brake test and was already accelerating when Mat counted in the rolling race
The porsche cheated every time
that blue car cheated in breake test
Porsche driver is so stupid
I rinsed my eyes from water just to make sure that I read that correctly.... 3 1000+ cars!!
1000HP M5 would have been nice here!
That Porsche cheated in every discipline
jesus christ that was insane
The first 4 figure horsepower dragrace. Well done Carwow
Every Single video, I just root for the Porsche
Can you DO BMW m5 1000hp vs Audi r8 1200
The Porsche casually cheating in every test
So what's the best predictor of a car's quarter mile time then? Cause obviously a car with 3x as much horsepower as the stock variant isn't 3x quicker to 1/4 mile.
Bit of a disaster this episode 😂😂😂 how ever still entertaining 👌👌👌🙌
Sigh 😔 tuned cars
Porshe driver👎🏽
The Porsche driver was just crap today😓😓
🇹🇷
Matt likes let him stay there I’ll just launch for and play 🤪
Mat please get an iPhone
YIANNI is always a thug
That Porsche
that porsche just cheesed everything
Mat got carried away 😂😂
ES MOTORS Turkey ?
The porche I swear cheats in the brake test and drops off early plus in the rolling races is so far back then speeds up to get level while matt is doing the countdown so he is already going quicker
You should add a thousand horsepower gtr in this race
Hi there, Wat Matson from warcow here
Yianni: Your brake callipers are tiny Matt: so are my balls right now 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Never mess with Porsche 911🔥😎
Love Arthurs Audi TT-RS so smart 👌🏼
HE NEEDS TO BRAKE BOOST FOR THE TT
The guy in the Porsche is so dumb
Out of control lol😅
Fireball
Nice 👍🏻
4:45 *vtec kicked in yo*
I’ve seen that ESMOTOR Porsche it’s fucken sick af
First comment
Yianni oh Yianni 🤣🤣
Can’t explain how fast I pressed on this video when I saw tuned Porsche 911
That Porsche driver was so bad
The porsche driver...
That Porsche shits on everyone 😂
Go to tesla site and buy S plaid
finally a comparison table👍
These engines wont survive 60,000 miles 🤣
What a mega drag race 😂😂😂😂 you would just NEVER find this ANYWHEREEEEE
This race is probably one of the best races ever.
Advance RIP matt..😜
I know mat you will do want we want.i asked to do the hyper cars drag race,but not hyper cars,high performance tuned cars this better mat. 😁😁😁😁.love your vedios.from 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
That audi tt turbo lag, but when it kicks in🤯
Porsche cheats every time
The pop up and the stats made me leave my work to watch this😂
I m watching your videos in Pakistan give me ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Plz bro I'm begging plz do a model 3 and BMW M i40 video from Scotland to London like u did with the tycan
Conduct the slowest drag race
*noice*
bro keep up i love your vedios
Still prefer tuned audi than dodge demon
Porsche 930*
Never have I seen mat so satisfied by a car sound🤣
They should have been driven by someone who knows how to drive them. Tuned cars of this caliber takes some skill, especialy the TT
Hey. Please review Porsche 930 (964))
the porsche is never on lvl w the other cars
I Really hope to see Bugatti s and Koenigseggs in a carwow drag race...🥲
The porsche driver likes to cheat i see
Make bmw m4 old vs new dragrace!
4:36 It will have a bit of turbo lag they said.
Mad powerrrr
What about the 1000+hp Supra? Are you gonna do a rolling race with that anytime soon?
I'm basically watching how hard it is to build the car just to get going.
Carwow has a really great team 👌
Where is BMW?
All I see is VW
Hello me in the future
Mat: I've got a partner in crime Yianni: 😂😂😂😂😂😂
ttRs audi was better
Last
All that horsepower with little reliability
Porsche Wins!(commented before watching)
Rocket launchers...
how cool is that
Surprising slow 1/4 mile times
Audi with limiters still sound nice
First blyat
Close Race, enjoyed watching all 13 minutes.
I think it might ne Not such a Bad death with ur best friend in a 1000+Hp car with yannis funny Face
1,100hp Audi TT RS, 1,200hp Audi R8 or 1,100hp Porsche 911...  If you could only have ONE, which would you choose?
Never been this early
VW will win. I swear
Do something with Plaid. The most powerful car ever.
3:14 So this video's about 8 months old.. Hmm 🤔
Best race ever omg Matt and Yianni😭😭
Mat, you should put Yainni in a trabant so his face can add a 1000hp to that car
Carwow  love you and mat
Notice gang

Tuned Turbo S is Good DRAG! But mat, you are quicker
