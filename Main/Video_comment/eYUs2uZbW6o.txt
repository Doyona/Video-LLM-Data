Man the last clip 💀
can you add videos to the compilations??
I said I can’t do it as soon as I saw jj
0:55 😭😭😭 “denim” 😭😭🙄
As someone that is American, we don’t claim them.
should watch your own videos and try not to cringe..
I got a state of survival mobile ad…. I think that was the cringiest
Petition for Simon to make another rap song 👽
That wrestler and ring girl really went crazy 😂
The fact Simon didn’t even realise the fact that was Jeremy Corbyn show show far from Politics he really is..
Haven’t seen anyone else mention it but 99% sure 4:31 is from a pick up conference where they paid girls to come in and show guys how to talk to them which makes it so much better
Simon cutting onions is cringe aswell, ly Simon
today I feel shame for being an American after watching this video
I'm cringing just seeing that footy shirt
Ay yo youtube , pls bring back the dislike button,  sorry Simon,  I couldn't take it no more
The most cringe thing about the last vid is Simon thinking The Hulk is a Werewolf.... since when did The Hulk howl, Simon?
Good old Tony Jones ay
came here for new setup
AYO Simon looks good with a beard
the guy at 8:54 looks like Crab Man from My Name Is Earl lmao
let it be said, 'Wrong Country was nuked in 1945'
i would comment, but its at 420 likes.
That just gave me diarhea
The only thing I am cringing about is his shirt
eh
The stubble looks very good
The fact I was eating whilst watching this makes it 10x worse
animal sex play is so gross to me and i don’t care if this is offensive to anyone cuz it’s gross, cuz to me, u should never put together sex and animals.  they should be nowhere near the same category
5:06 best Thalia impression ever
i need a warning next time asmr appears cuz goddamn i almost just smash my keyboard
8:17
why is deji in the tumbnail thats sad
I can't believe he hasn't seen the mall song before😂 "backpacks, backpacks, come get your backpacks" makes me laugh so much lmaoo
I agree Simon most Americans are tapped I unfortunately am one
if simon was invisable hed look like my dad
Thats not a bear but just a stubble
Wow.😂
simon got a beared
It’s cringe that Simon thought the guy turning into a werewolf was turning into the hulk 😂
Yeees a Horton reference ayeee😂😂
As someone who lives in America, I don't claim these people.
Please add Simons cringe roadman patois to the next cringe video
God, what a horror... A guy who thinks he's a wolf needs an exorcist... Well, or a psychiatrist.
My cringe faces matched Simon's. The fucks boys make me spew a little
No one cares, you're merely demonstrating how you think someone would feel form your personal perspective.. Which more than proves how obscure your logic is because it makes no sense at all to think in such terms.. bragging by proving your a fool... really?
lit ep.
the rampage one is legendary
simon with a beard gives me martinelli vibes
Lovin the beard Simon
Fam Simons beard is growing so fast what the hell
Simon you are so damn funny! I just love watching ur videos! 🙂
I feel so sorry for all of the American people
John 3:16 For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten son, that whosoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life.   Here’s a reminder of how much God loves you! God bless you🤍
Good grief. That’s all I can say 😂
This is more of a try not to regurgitate
What.. What did i just watch
MAARTENNNNN
The things people will do for a bit of attention smh. I’m only 18 and I truly believe as a human race we’re well and truly fucked
ngl I spent half the vid thinking this was sidemen reacts
Can’t believe he clip of deji joking epic games won was on this compilation it wasn’t cringe at all. I thought it was quite funny actually.
Salam brothers, please, can you help me, because I have serious health conditions, I need some tests and some tests, and in my country I do not have health coverage… I swear to you that I and my child did not find a living
8:17 Or just never download the app or just delete it because the whole app is clapped.
simon the beard is sexy
I am an American and I will not claim any of the Americans in this video most Americans aren’t like this.
Simon's beard looks good pls keep it bro
I’m very disappointed at this generation…smh
I would love a hug from Kesha
All of these comments are about simons beard
Btw your in a drill sound called ove bagzoverfame x riskey talk on who
3:33 when Logan Paul said KSI was a dog, this is what he meant
only in america
I have ocd
Not all the sidemen growing beats except jj

Nothing more cringe than the 14yr olds in the comments who are convinced Simon has a beard now
Sorry simon i had to dislike cuz i cringed so hard
Man got rejected by the Lake of Dreams💀
“Most of Americans are tapped” factual statement right here
Why?
I am loving the beard
KEEP THE BEARD
9-0
7:50 when your girl likes doggy too much 😂
Why is no one talking about 3:30
Trying to look for a comment that’s not about Simons beard. Does look good though
I just covered half the screen at this point
I like your Beard Simon 💪🏾
Keep that beard going!
Simon’s dance was cringe 😢😢
It’s not fair UK has a population of 67 mi
November comes around you trying not to bust a nut 😂😂😭😭😂😂😭😭 8:56
Simon with a beard turns me on and I can’t be the only one

jj is gonna kill u when u get a full beard 😂
Mai me?
GOOD OL' TJ AT 1:45
wow….last time i saw you you were playing portal 2 with ethan.
a “meh-me?” 😭😭😭
America is down ASTRONOMICALLY BAD.  Ever since Europeans colonize America, they take “land of the free” to whole new levels of down bad.
Oi that beard is coming in clean
The beard suits him
"From Whoville" 😭
They did marshall dirty 😭
this was difficult to watch
I thought the title said try not to laugh challenge, these always just make me feel so ick  on the bright side, as awkward and self conscious as I may be at least I know I'm not *that* bad
The last one I’m sure he’s turning into a werewolf
3:30 is that paige
@wwos 1:55
I HATE the sound of gulping it's so gross glad I'm not the only one lol
I am American and I can agree we are most indeed quite tapped
REACT TO DEJI'S NEW VID!!!!!
Can we agree that not all Americans are tapped?
jj has been trying to grow a beard for years and simon has been growing a beard for about less than a month
the cheese guy looks like Jay Swingler
ayo americans don’t claim puppy girl bruh
“The more I listen to it, the harder it gets” - Simon 2022.
As an American I don’t agree, for the record, and honestly Brit’s have a classification system on how tapped you are, ie set 8
U can tell how much Simon has watched that deji clip. Because he does the action at the same time perfectly
That beard looks like saddle on a cow
Respect to anyone who didn’t actually cringe
8:28 "WHAT IS THIS MAN??" Such passion in that. I agree too, like wtf is wrong with these people xD
miniminter with facial hair... already cringing
Simon should put beard oil on and use a dermaroller and he could have a nice beard
He should play inscryption
I put this on in hopes of having entertainment while i ate my food. I found myself unable to chew due to being so weirded out I froze on the spot.
Yess
8:05 disgusting 🤮
I like the new look 🧔‍♂️
Clicking off the video a minute in, too cringe for me.
Gotta love rampage 3:39
never knew a failed hulk transformation resulted in a wolf.
Ikr
what would you rather have an american puppy girl or an Norwegian girl horse
Beard looking sharp
5:00 It totally feels like women are incapable of thinking about unreal scenarios that might be why most dont like sci fi
simon wid beard>>>>>>>
Damn Simon has a beard now. Well sorta. Keep growing it bro.
The east hills advertisement is from my hometown, St. Joseph, MO. Yes, everyone here hates it as well😂
Soon, Simon without a beard will be weird
Simon suits the beard
Great look with the beard make some people jealous 😅
5:25 the fact simon memorised deji's exact hand movement and everything is hilarious
Dinosaur 🦖
Majority of white Americans are tapped, we DO NOT condone any actions from the majority of them. The colored Americans are somewhat tapped but most of them are actually funny. Once again, majority of white Americans are tapped, and we do not condone any actions that were present in this video. Thanks.
White Americans*
9:00 simon still thinking he is turning into the hulk even after he howled like a werewolf.
As an American, most of us know. And the ones who don’t are the ones who can’t be helped
These beard comments are so annoying
7:32 I literally said I hate being an American before Simon said we’re tapped
You must have seen 90% of these ?
1:00 got me tripping
I leave YouTube and come back to find Simon with a beard and jj still where he is smh
OI SIMON LOOKS LIKE JORJINGHIO
The wrestler guy really looked like when dogs start humping random things for continued amounts of time

The beard lookin immaculate
I'm American and I can totally agree that 85% of Americans are tapped.
Have a good shave
Simon is playing with fire with deji in the phumbnail
How does your beard grow by the day
As an American, I can agree we are tapped. Like extremely so. I’d venture to say that humans are tapped, but it’s mainly Americans 😂
When I see old videos with Simon without the stache it looks weird.
Wasn't a good idea to watch this while eating.
bro sound like you Simon talking to that girl dog
I like your beard keep it
As a fellow American I can say that we are tapped most definitely tapped
Watching these clips makes me cringe so much it physically hurts me

How has Simon never seen the back to school song
Beard looking really good tbf
3:30 was the worst thing ive ever seen
Not kidding, the beard is a w
Simon he turned into a werewolf not the hulk he howled

"Years ago they try to..."  "Years ago they try to put me in a..."  "This is live?"
Ngl had to hide half of my screen for most of the video and just watch Simon’s reaction. He’s a brave one
Thus beard thing looks very solid let it grow more

Why did I watch this while eating
I'm starting to think maybe I shouldn't claim I'm an American

That Growl one and swallow fella  make me cringe into the forth dimension!
