Ohhh now I get it the concept of WE HAVE A PROBLEM!
listen ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////songs///////////////////////////////////////ancien///////////////2022/2060
Look look look look that’s Nicki do we have a problem 🙄
Do we have a problem? 🥺😵😵😵
Why are people acting like nobodys ever said "look at my wrist" before. People really think an artist worth $150m came to a random artists song, took 1 line and said "hmmm lemme just put this in my song".  if u wanna talk about copying i got a LONG list of what other female rappers have copied from other people
They don’t wanna be saved by Church boys until the bad boys show them why they need saving😒irony is when she say “ I want a nigga who talk to me nice”
I am hearing People saying Nicki Minaj stole the beats and made Do we Have a Problem?🤣
The way Nicki copied from this and kill her dead she's the most original btch and girls wanna be like her 😭😭😭
Wait did Nicki sample shaybo on Do We Have A Problem?👀
0:46 Onika did u just??? Um....nvm...
nahhhh yalll loookkk tf gooodddddd  vibeeee
Nicki clearly still has writer’s block💀
Dreamdoll came WAY 2 HARD for this song!

Broke boys always chasing me Homeless-looking niggas say they wan' change for me Church boys say they pray for me Wasting your time if you think that you're saving me 'Cause I want a nigga that's gang I want a nigga with tats and bands in his hands I want a nigga with ice I want a nigga who rude, but he talk to me nice I want a nigga that's bad How much cases you had? Tell me what jail you been? 'Cause all of them talk like they tough 'Til I play with them rough, they be crying on a baby ting Darling, I'm hard to impress Shit, the ice on my neck, I don't wanna go Bagel King I can't take disrespect I'm sick in my head, so stay away from me Be careful, girl, you don't know me well I'm crazy as hell, don't play with me He treat me well, I'm his baby girl I don't kiss and tell, so he rating me Like look at my swag, look at my drip Look at my ice, look at my wrist Look at my ass, look at my tits I told you before I ain't a basic bitch Broke boys always chasing me Homeless-looking niggas say they wan' change for me Church boys say they pray for me Wasting your time if you think that you're saving me 'Cause I want a nigga that's gang I want a nigga with tats and bands in his hands I want a nigga with ice I want a nigga who rude, but he talk to me nice (dream) I want a nigga with guap Nigga that give me the top and don't fuck with the opps Lick it and get every drop My panties polka dot, take 'em off, get to the spot Juicy, my shit need a mop Titties look right in the crop My bezel is bigger than Ben in the clock Don't talk about pounding this pussy If you ain't got pounds when I shop None of this shit is a joke Niggas was sleeping on Dream, but you better stay woke I'm on the block with the blokes I make a million while I'm chillin', so we never broke Broke boys always chasing me Homeless-looking niggas say they wan' change for me Church boys say they pray for me Wasting your time if you think that you're saving me 'Cause I want a nigga that's gang I want a nigga with tats and bands in his hands I want a nigga with ice I want a nigga who rude, but he talk to me nice Broke boys always chasing me Homeless-looking niggas say they wan' change for me Church boys say they pray for me Wasting your time if you think that you're saving me 'Cause I want a nigga that's gang I want a nigga with tats and bands in his hands I want a nigga with ice I want a nigga who rude, but he talk to me nice

oh darling ! 😍 from nyc with ❤️
Dreamdoll is the most underrated female rappers in the game. She got the looks and style. "Her delivery and cadence on records is mind blowing". She kilt this shit PERIOD!....
Quick question, so if a dude whoop her ass black & blue, do we sympathize or quote her own lyrics for her?
Yess!!! They do it ao different over there.. I LOVE IT!!!
DreamDolls verse is the reason I’m here 😭 “I need a n*** with guap, lick it and gimme that top” 😫👏🏼👏🏼
Idk how this ain't at a million yet YouTube really playing with u

I love shaybo and this song but why dreamdoll ain’t promote it not once ? Hmmm this seems to be an ongoing theme when US rappers link up wit UK ones
guys this is just a theory but i think dreamdoll's nails might be fake
Now that I have discovered this I can't get enough of this song!!!!

She’s very pretty
Why did she collaborate with dd though?

Jesus love you, he died on the cross for you, accept him as your lord and savior he can change everything. For God so loved the world that he gave his only son, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life" (Jn 3:16"  But you must repent too. From that time Jesus went about preaching and saying, Let your hearts be turned from sin, for the kingdom of heaven is near. (Matthew 4:17)!
Dream be bringing it though 🔥🔥
Yoooooooooo they snappppped this on repeat 🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯💯💯

JAH Matthew 12:43 The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here.

Dreams line about being woke sounds exactly like the line in Nicki minajs new body ..... Other than that it was  nice

So these are the mothers of the boys running around stabbing and shooting each other on the streets of London? It now makes sense. It starts in the home. What do you expect when they have mothers like this and fathers described in this song?

Real ones known, Lost ones, feel it!  No disrespect to any of you, Including Shaybo, But this is, Ah no go make it one for me!   Love to East, North, South, West. Not bias at all around. 👊🏽

Love DreamDoll's Rebrand hope she gets support from the industry and a big push from her label.
I’ve been loving Dream since she grew into her sound after the whole “Life in Plastic” phase ended. She’s been so lit  since then... I found this song from following Dream and damn I love this chick Shay Bo 😍😍😍 she’s beautiful and I loveeee her flow and sound. TWO QUEENS WE LOVE ITT
Black people we are not English.   Our DNA tells us we are African.
This is great!!!!!!!
I love it keep the good bangers coming play and talk nice with it ..  #nice #twice
Shybo is polluting our young black queen's mind with all them shit talks, UK is not US we don't need this shit, we already got enough negativity on our plate!!!
OMGGG✨
The kind of men she is describing will break her heart and waste her time. Why do rappers rap about toxic relationships ? It is getting really boring
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯

Lovee dreamdoll🔥🔥❤️
They're hard still! 🌟💚
this is the music our sisters daughters are going to grow up listening to and females who they are looking up to as role models we are finished the black community needs serious educating both male and females because some of the music we are making is absolute trash bragging about street lifestyle or street life no wonder why we end up not having a strong family unite that can really teach our males and females better
🔥🔥🔥
Y'all ATE!
Ain't gonna lie you got to love Shaybo the gyal drops in no filter no holding bck flexing on a whole other level lord have mercy 🤒 .. Bless up . ✌📿💯

Shaybo I really enjoyed your broke boyz keep it up
Shaybo is stepping into the scene with a completely different vibe
Shaybo is who she thinks she is!!!!!!!
Not too fond of the content, but it's a banger all the same and I probably would nod my head in a club I suppose... ❤️💛💚
Literally 99% won’t see this but I lost my job due to covid. They shut down all the restaurants in Cook county which then led me to loosing my apartment. I'm currently living out of my car which I try and make the best of. I've applied to a bunch of places I'm hoping to get a call back. if anyone could help me with whatever you could bc I'm needing stuff like hand warmers which I stuff my clothes at night when it's cold. Also cheap burgers/fastfood. I know times are tough for everyone these days but if you're able to help me I have paypal username pay2winlife  If you're unable to help I totally understand God bless you stay safe.
Shaybo never dissapont
THE Queen of drill💕👸🏾
Those girls are more fake then my rolex buyed from wish
