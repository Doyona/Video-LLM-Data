Roofe's Last Ever Goal For Rangers
wouldnt of been the score if Antony was there.
Betis mala suerte hala Madrid ❤
Roofe’s last goal for Rangers
1:22 4:33
Glasgow rangers carrying Scotlands flag once more ,
Davies at fault for both goals ,goodbye
I’m a diehard bear. I would like to acknowledge the 1st Betis goal. Pure class.
"What is it, about Rangers and the Europa League!!"   "The redemption, in Seville!!"  "They've done it the hard way, the heroic way!!"
Great performance rangers🎉
Brilliant gers
Nice result congrat. /Newcastle fan/
We are the people 🇹🇼🇬🇧 its my First live match in Seville ❤❤❤
I was there ( Benito Villamarin) flew from Tenerife north on match day.. the game sent me utopia euphoria 😂🎉😂 We are the people
If only Roofe weren’t injured so damn much. Would be the top striker in Scottish league
We are rangers super rangers ❤️🇬🇧
How can we not take this into old firm games? So frustrating being behind an average Celtic side
Even if they travel down last night they still have to get home safely. This is good for us no chance of picking up more injuries before the oldfirm .
Simply the best WATP ❤️🤍💙
Good game both sides went all out.real betis are fast.defence is weak tho.rangers played well tho well organized passing game  💨⚽
Typed the group with a fully depleted squad,beale picked a squad that made us have 3 less squad players had a lb that 5mill was paid for Turkish international played evey league game but couldn't make the the squad for Europe after beale spent over 15 million on desssers and lameers who are without doubt 2 of the worst players I've seen  dessers is only getting a game because of danilos injury and even lovelace has a big injury so playing dessers for 45 cause we have to is embarrassing worst striker I've seen in a rangers shirt going back before Sandra,,even sebo had more to his game but the job clement has done in 2 months with thses duds is nothing shirt of remarkable
Fluked that win
SUPER RANGERS AWAY
Well done rangers, great result. celtic fan btw. Credit where credit is due.
What a result for Rangers. Against all the odds they beat Real Betis. Fantastic.
My heart canny do this again 😂
Dessers made that goal himself with the sideways header ,then got off his mark to meet Cifuentes pass to finish. Starting to believe in him
We still cant defend
Scottish and British what a club proudly flying the soltire and union flag where ever we go unlike the terrorist supporting other mob embarrassment to Scotland and the UK watp
All neutrals should know by now, the only team in scotland is glasgow rangers 🇬🇧
Jack Buckland has to be worried about being second best to the goals he let in.
I've only watched this 10 times and I'm still not done ❤
These results aren't flukes. We also beat borussia Dortmund on their patch 4-2
Their keeper nutmegged twice 😂
Brilliant result. Fancied a shock when I saw the way Isco and Peres celebrated their 2nd goal . They thought the game was over, their arrogance gor the better of them. After Rangers scored the 3rd Betis players looked shocked - apart from one effort they didn't look like scoring in the last 15 mins. Betis were technically  the better side but the Gers had the bigger desire.
Raaaaangers !! 🔴⚪️🔵
We’re back! 😍
Always great to see Rangers do their bit for British football.
Kemar doing what strikers need to do: be in the right place at the right time and put it in the net.  A class act.
Phenomenal result for Rangers. They just seem to have that grit as a club to grind out these hard games and hang on to create opportunities, whereas Celtic maybe have too much of the big fish small pond attitude to compete in Europe.  This is potentially big for Scottish football too. The coefficient might be more important over the next year or two with the format changes to the champions league. At least Celtic and Aberdeen also managed at least a win in the past couple days even if they're both dead and buried.
Great result gotta say love the all blue strip C'mon the Gers
Call us what u want as u wish. Thanks for coming to watcg us. Thanks for the support and thanks for finishing bottom of your group. Also thanks for getting knocked out of cup and see u on the 30th of Jan... kind regards. GLASGOW RANGERS OR SEVCO what evrr u wish to call us. Just thanks for watching our highlights and comenting. Means allot
From a lifelong Celtic supporter massive respect to Rangers for winning that group.
Massive congratulations to Dessers goal, I mean what a goal, megged the keeper too. Make me proud son 🙌😮🎉😂
What a great match by both teams and hopefully Rangers can go all the way. That penalty shootout final heartbreak against Frankfurt is still in memory :-)
Honestly as much as it pains me to say it this is an outstanding result and hats off to Rangers. Their form in Europe has been brilliant these past few years, they deserve a lot of credit. I just hope we can improve on our results in Europe but the mentality needs a complete overhaul.
Europa league 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Rangers fans are top class.
Butland to the rescue lol
Massive credits to the Team, well done.....
Glasgow is green💚 3-1 on th 30th Their goal is a pen like always
Some of the patter in these comments is diabolical
Hope this is the spark that ignites Rangers' last Europa run. They are like headless horsemen on some occasions, definately put some money on them. Love a great underdog side, the other teams lose out of their own ignorance. For Real Betis, this was very sore and destroyed their "honourable" record.
The best away support in Europe. Can't be matched
Yas
Great content, would watch again
TIOCFAIDH AR LA 1916
Great result, Sterling making a difference and three great goals, shows the desire, respect also for the comments from supporters of other top UK clubs,  cheers !
Brilliant performance by the Gers, let's take that determination into Hampden on Sunday 🇬🇧💙🇬🇧💙
The result is even better than suggested considering it was pretty much achieved with ten men. Lammers strolled about all night and contributed very little. I've watched Rangers since the 70's and Lammers is well up there with the worst.
Another special evening.   If they go to Dublin we will follow on
Betis unbeaten at home all season, no team had scored more than one at their stadium. Until Rangers came to town 🔴⚪️🔵
Cyriel goal was brilliant 🎉
Once again it's Glasgow Rangers who are doing the Biz again in Europe,  WATP from Glasgow 😊🇬🇧👍
Sima is still only 22 ,get him signed 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🇬🇧
If Clement had got to pick his ideal selection Rangers would have been out.  Arf arf!
❤🤍💙
Union bears .Mon the gers🇬🇧
That was some performance 😅
Brilliant result
Imagine if in 2016 that one day Ayoze Perez and Isco would be playing together, managed by Man City gaffer Manuel Pellegrini
Let them cooooook 💙
The noise from the Rangers supporters at the final whistle was so loud you'd have thought that they were the Home side. Feckin' AWESOME!
That goal was amazing work from the striker
Totally amazing wee alwas do it the hard way , but the fair way , now lets build on this n do the dirty sheeps 😎👍
Great result for Rangers. I support the other team but great to see a Scottish side do well in  Europe!
BLOODY HELL WELL DONE RANGERS WON THE GROUP FROM THIRD TO TOP THATS GOT TO BE ONE OF YOUR BEST WINS EVER !!!!!!! 🏐🥅⚽🏆💙
Aye a strong connection up here with the Hammers. Onwards to Dublin 🇬🇧🇬🇧
As a PTFC fan who doesn’t particularly like the 2 Glasgow giants, i do tip my hat to this result. Some statement 👏
Celtic fan here...  but well done rangers . Played well deserved that win there .. i wont be saying good luck lol but can say well done haha
Another lucky win for rangers in Europe.   Anyone who says otherwise hasn’t had any look at their run domestically over the last twenty years.   Why these teams lay down for them is beyond me, this same club will go and draw 0-0 with motherwell the next week 😂😂
Though I was watching prime R9 with Dessers and his goal😂.
Delighted for Rangers! Always enjoying watching them in Europe.
This rangers team starting to gel now. 💙
Said it so many times over the last few years, Roofe is the best all round striker we have at the club and that was including when Morelos was here, nobody else scores those types of half chances, his overall goal/ minute ratio is outrageous but so is his minutes played 🤣🤣 if we could just keep him fit for an extended period of time what an asset he is.
What is it about Rangers losing 7 - 0 at home to Liverpool
Hard fought victory against a good team, a horrible referee, and a lot of diving around. Never surrender 🇬🇧
FTH.
The cut back from Goldson
Great goal from desser
Good to see it warming up in Glasgow,couple of weeks ago it was -8,by next Thursday it will be -2 !
No surrender rangers 💙 😊
Guardardo still plays??! Legend!
well played.
Well done Rangers, great victory. Have to say the first Betis goal was a thing of beauty! 😲
What a game
Scottish football has shown we’re not a league of teams underestimate. Rangers win v Betis, Celtic win v feyenood, Aberdeen win v E.Frankfurt doing Scotland proud
Tav at fault for both goals and so many dangerous balls across our goal
some great goals..
The vid title sounds like Bill Cosby wrote it 😂
Magic performance
Tough place to go and Rangers went and played with no fear. They have performed really well in Europe recently and this is another big scalp for them. To finish top of this group is impressive. Nice few bob in the kitty and a big knock out tie to look forward to. Hats off to them.
Excellent week for Scottish football in Europe
Fighting Scots never give up!!!
Gary mc finn King of Scotland and millport here . Happy days 😊
Congratulation to Rangers.💪i like better Celtic  even do they are rubbish in euroup but i support Celtic coz they stand with palastine 🇵🇸❤️
Well done Rangers! An extremely impressive result against a very good team.
It’s all about the Aberdeen 🔥
This is what it's like to be a rangers fan❤
great result!!! but super lucky from them highlights they didnt lose. 2 disallowed goal. great fighting spirit tho.  Defence needs to wake up abit more in following games
What a cracking match, some great goals from both teams. Well done The Gers
Rangers always do it the hard way...dropping five points to some part-time Cypriot team leaving them with having to go to an unbeaten La Liga team and pick up all three in the last game...crazy team.
Because I’m British and proud of my country, I will unequivocally support rangers until the end. On the other hand, Celtic are a national disgrace.   🇬🇧🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
I can't believe it. I'm smiling this morning. What a game I thought weakest link lammers .everytime gave the ball away .Great result. Brilliant 👍 👏
What a night…,simply the best 🇬🇧
Heartbreaking for Betis. I think we deserved more but we need to be stronger in deffense and can't loose these kind of games. Congratulations to Rangers fans
Ross mcausland was amazing tonight absolute gem of a player the future of rangers
Dessers is a God
Celtic fan here, good to oneScottish team do well in Europe and class result for The rangers. I'd love to say it's just the Champions league is way above Celtics level but seems like we bottle it in any European competition, we're just lucky Rangers don't play like this Domestically. Rogers is in for a big shock as Rangers has evolved since the last time he was here. Best of luck in Europe but mon the Aberdeen come Sunday haha jokes aside great to see a scottish team qualify for last 16 of European football
There best player is an on loan Brighton player 😂
Glasgow is blue
😊😊😊😊😊
they got battered jammy lot
What's with this nonsense "the frame of the goal"? What happened to the word "crossbar"?
Well done Rangers, amazing first half. Roofe mot⚽️
Btw sima is on loan from Brighton 😂 another talent to watch out
The Tims are RAGIN!
lucky Rangers
Well done rangers 💙💙
Still trying to work out why the 18 had his arm up for so long when they had a defender at the side of the keeper for the last goal  !?
Rangers turn up in Europe than in the league
WE DID IT MON THE GERS 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
the best club on the planet RANGERS
Incredible, we are Glasgow Rangers!
Betis unbeatable at home before rangers come along. . With the squad we had, did not think we would win away from home. Not with all these injuries.
👍
Well done big Phil, tactics were spot on, Lunny was tremendous in midfield,  and the world class support wasn't bad either.
Rangers are going to win it this year.
Mon the gers
Brilliant brilliant result for the Gers great to see so many fans there going nuts well done guys ⚽🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧 from an Ulster GOONER
Well done Rangers. Real Betis are no easy team to beat, they are sitting 7th in LaLiga.
A lesson to anti gers refs in scotland which is most of them this ref no mistakes no nonsense no surrender😅
True blues....well done the billy boys...✊🏻🍺🍺⚽️
Quality result Rangers from a West Ham fan, 👌🏼⚒️🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🇬🇧
The Thrilla in Sevilla - well done Rangers and this from a Celtic supporter!!!
Kemar Roofe is just that guy
2 poor teams with dreadful defending. Bets missed a load of chances and only have themselves to blame lol!!!.
Aberdeen, Celtic & Rangers all win in Europe. Unbelievable.
Massive result for yous troops done scottish football proud I'd support any Scottish team in Europe except they celtic b......s from stu b hmfc 1874
Thursday nights are Rangers nights 🇬🇧
As a rangers fan I am absolutely buzzing that we have won home and away to real betis 💙
Betis should have had a pen for handball
Fantastic away result WATP 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🇬🇧
Dublin final 😂😂😂😂 CARNAGE 150,000 or more in Dublin 😳😳😳
Sweet result well done Rangers.
This team were unbeaten in last 6, a draw with Madrid and unbeaten this season in this stadium, then came Rangers. Only way Scottish clubs will make a name for themselves is doing well in Europe. Apart from the one off disaster in CL Rangers have an excellent record in this competition👏👏🇬🇧🇬🇧.
What a result
Yet again Rangers holding the fort for Scottish football in europe.
WATP
So dessers can be good? Surprising yet promising. Garbage by Lammers and wtf is the defence doing, Tav rubbish, Sterling really good if only he started.
Good performance from Roofe, alert & dangerous all game.
As a west ham fan, huge respect for rangers
Once again rangers doing what the catholic wronguns can’t
Brilliant 🇬🇧
I can feel another final coming  on.but this time it will be ours.buZZZing.well done Rangers and our top drawer  manager.
Flying the flag in Scotland as usual 🇬🇧
I had no idea Real Betis were so bad.
As my 3 year old daughter says...thats how u do it guys😎🤣🤣
Watching that dessers goal makes me laugh 😂😂😂 Guys had some shocking games but today he was excellent
Given our decimated squad I genuinely thought Betis would hammer us tonight. Phil Clement must take huge credit for what he’s delivering from this squad. Raskin, Cantwell, Jack, Dowell, Lawrence, Danilo, Davis, Wright all injured and Balogun, Yilmaz ineligible going into this game. Real Betis haven’t lost at home since May before tonight?  Some result for Rangers.
As a Celtic fan, Rangers are due to win this sometime,i wouldn't put it past them to do so andbto do it within the next year, or two.Wvwn the conference league would be some achievement.
The greatest club in history. The Famous RFC 🔴⚪️🔵
Bloody hell, Celtic & Ranger win in Europe in the same week..
Only rangers can put Scotlands  Coefficient points  on our backs and continues the success
Here for SIMA🎉
With our midfield decimated it’s been a stroke of genius from big Phil playing Sterling in there, a machine physically and surprisingly good technically as well… would love to see young Rice get a wee run in the side too
Another Amazing evening in UEFA League for Betis another Brillian Victory..... 😂😂😂😂😂
Wow I'm a Celtic fan but that was decent and a credit to Scottish football!
gotta give that win to Phil, two key subs won the game in the end
all the cellik fans coming on and being sick hahahahahah
No Surrender 🇬🇧🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🇬🇧
God was watching over them tonight……
Pleased for Roofe to get that winning goal! Wish he was still playing for Leeds.
What a game
Brilliant result. Betis were unbeaten at home until tonight and no1 had scored more than 1 goal against them at home either. Not even Real Madrid. Team showed guts and fight and did us all proud. It’s mad to think we have 14 1st team players injured right now! Loved seeing all the rangers fans celebrating the goals in the home end too 👌🤣
Yep the dregs of Europe cup ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Go home Rangers it means nothing
Gobsmacked but what this shows is clement is shaping the squad with what he wants them to think like to be winners. Brings on sterling who was as good as anyone spotting the lane between tav and mcausland was weak its just a joy to watch a guy proactively fix issues
Unbelievable result - well done, Rangers!!
Gonna have to move the final if we get to dublin as uefa banned us in 84 from ever playing in the republic 😂.Game against bohemians was mental so much so in 2000 we had to play shelbourne at tranmeres ground 😂.Sorry lads i just remembered that little problem.Imagine over 150.000 bears in dublin it would trouble free now as the irish have thoughts on other people now.
Unbelievable game, and congratulations to my beloved Rangers! Congratulations to them for qualifying for the Europa League knockout stages!  ‘MON THE GERS!
What. A. Result. Well done Rangers!
Up the Glasgow rangers
Dessers goal was lovely to watch
Fantastic result wonderful 3 goals we rode our luck at times now let's go and win the cup on Sunday to end a perfect week 😊😊😊
Rangers had all the luck tonight so many players performed well betis could of had about 3 penalties. What a result couple of times I thought betis would of had it they maybe would of if there fans cheered them on just a little bit
Thought Glasgow’s Rangers were already out?
Congratulations lads from LUFC
Rangers have beaten  RB Leipzig 3-1  Dortmund 4-2  Braga 1-0 3-1 3-2 Red star 1-0 3-0  Legia Warsaw 1-0  Galatasaray 2-1 Porto 2-0 3-2  Royal Antwerp 5-2 4-3  Standard leige 2-0 3-2  Feyenoord 1-0  Real betis 1-0 3-2   Over the years

Respect from a Villa fan, insane result to top the group
Absolutely brilliant. Well done to Clement and our lads. WATP
Must say betis first goal was simply the best 🇬🇧🇬🇧
We are the famous RFC!
Another special evening in European football for Rangers. They carry Scotland in Europe, respect 🫡

Real Madrid and 19 ofher la liga teams haven't being able to beat betis at home this season ranger's did
🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧a canny take it anymore my wee ticker I was going like a tea pot lid ffs 🫣😂😂😂😂
rangers vs liverpool final 1-1 then penalties
A Scottish team winning a game in europe that had some importance about it
We made HISTORY tonight for the great worldwide Rangers family  NOT for the dregs and bigots that call themselves "scottish fitbaw"... WATP!
Gone the teddy bears!!!!!!!!
The Kings 11 🇬🇧
If we go to Dublin we will follow on 🤞🇬🇧
dessers so good
What a night to be a rangers fan. That was amazing tonight in the pub with my father in law . What a game and victory!!!!
Not easy wining a game that matters in Europe not for everyone being in Europe after Xmas. Watp
Winning European groups isn't for every Glasgow club
🇬🇧❤️🤍💙WATP❤️🤍💙🇬🇧
Respect from a Liverpool fan congratulations well deserved a hard fought victory ✌️
That goal from Dessers reminded me so much of prime Torres
good results all round for british clubs tonight
Rangers leading the way for Scotland in Europe yet again🇬🇧
As a Chelsea fan i'm delighted for Rangers,everyone knows the links between our clubs...fantastic boys,well done-Chels ain't good enough to be in europe a.t.m. so we're gonna hang on your coat tails! hahahaha! Well done the Gers,delighted for ya! from Piers a.k.a. Chopper.
Well done the Gers 🐻...from England UTV 🦁
I'm a Celtic man but well done! Good result and professional performance 👏👏👏
Fantastic result Rangers..your fans deserve nights like this!
howay the teddy bears
brilliant for Rangers & the Scottish game well done from a Celtic fan 👏🏼
Quiet the night ... I like it quiet
What a result, regret taking my daughter to Xmas market to avoid watching an anticipated battering.
Mon the Gers!!
Everyone loves Rangers !  They are an amazing club and fanbase.
Why do people feel the need to say where they're from and who they support in their comment? "From a PAOK Salonika fan in Grimsby" gtfo here couldn't give a monkey's about your heritage 😂
Rangers once again bringing hard earned coefficient points to Scotland unlike the other Old Firm team who should also play in the Europa League which is more their level 🤷‍♂️
WATP ❤️🤍💙 qualify for the next stage of europa league ….  Smash the sheep in cup final this Sunday … then batter the Tim’s on 30th 🙌🏽🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿  Great end to the year that will be 💯🫶🏻 🍊
4 British teams topped there groups tonight in the europa league 4 out of 8 groups 👌🇬🇧💙🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
I’m feeling it
No tims in europe😂
A Supposedly Scottish team in Europe and not one Scottish flag to be seen, embarrassing.
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Fantastic result for a club only formed in 2012. They can now add the 'We beat Betis' cup to the 'We beat Dortmund' cup which sits proudly next to the 'Covid' cup at Ibroke. Such a pity its still only 2 Domestic trophies in 12 long years! 2 in 12, I call that tinpot! 😘😘😘
Massive credit to Sterling, “once again” coming on and bossing it. What more does he need to do to get a start. Unbelievable performance when we were low on squad numbers. Dare to dream …. Again 🔴⚪️🔵
Cracking result
Absolutely brilliant, same again on Sunday please 🙏
This was an insane result. All we needed to do in the previous round of fixtures was to beat the worst side in the group, who's only points came against us when we didn't have a manager. We failed to do that, so had to do it the hard way- win away in Spain for the first time in Rangers' history, against a side unbeaten at home (and who just drew against Real Madrid at the weekend).   Incredible. Clement is a genius. Hopefully we can win the League Cup at the weekend and keep the momentum going.
Marvellous.Beale's players coming good.
'When we go to Dublin we will follow on......'
What a result. The only Scottish team to make it through. A big difference between this one, and the ugly people winning a dead rubber last night. We are the people and surely all Scotland will be behind us come March when we play again. ❤️🤍💙❤️🤍💙🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧😁😁😁
Rangers 💪⚽️⚽️⚽️
great result for the rangers :D
Very entertaining game
Doesn’t change the fact that rashford had more red cards than goals this ucl season 😂
Waiting to hear the congratulations from sutton 😛😛😛
WATP! 💙🇬🇧
I’m a West Ham fan, but have followed the Gers since the 90’s. Great away result
Play up Glasgow Rangers 🇬🇧 let's get silverware on Sunday what a result the Teddy Bears WATP
😅
Goose bumps  WRTP
Wow boys. Proud
That whole group stage played out like something from the Twilight Zone
Good results for the scottish teams but its easier when teams have no pressure on them like Aberdeen and Celtic the Gers were playing to win the group.
Love my club so much 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🇬🇧💙 so proud of everyone of use tonight 👌 stepping up to the mark and got the job done well done Glasgow rangers 💙
Up the gers 🇬🇧
Rangers will want to lift the Europa League now.
Who's the people? We are 😊. The famous Glasgow Rangers with a lovely wee Christmas present for the loyal,joyful teddy bears fans❤🤍💙🇬🇧
Always enjoy watching Rangers in the europa league  well done lads
Credit to big Connor.Could easily have smashed it but nice composure for the cut back.
Imagine rangers made the final in dublin, would be an absolute war😭
First home defeat of the season Betis 😆😆 gutted they’re out though, great team!!
Playing in Europe after Christmas definitely isn't for everyone, 🤫🤭😄
Yes the gers love from the shankill ❤
If the Champions League was played on Thursday night I genuinely belive Rangers could win it
Beating betis on a Thursday night big dessers is dynamite ohh what a night
Celtic, Aberdeen & rangers all winning - great for Scots but this by far was the most meaningful & biggest win, & they’re through to last 16
FACIL!!!!
Get in there🔴⚪️🔵
No tims in Europe!
fantastic, well done lads 👏
GLASGOW RANGERS 🔴⚪️🔵
Let’s go Rangers 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 🇬🇧 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 love❤

Never doubt Rangers in the Europa league
Fair play to Rangers. Can’t believe they’ve finished top with only 11 points though. Mental group results.
Still in shock from this 🇬🇧
A brilliant away result for Rangers - respect from an Englishman with a family connection in Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🇬🇧
Mon the famous 🎉
Amazing rangers! Big sterling came in and controlled Isco, changed the game. Could be a Bassey situation maybe, hopefully.
What a win🇬🇧🇬🇧
