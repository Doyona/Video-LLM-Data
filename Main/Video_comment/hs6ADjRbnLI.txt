It kind of baffles me with Sheffield united, I mean at the time of this game united where in great form and Sheffield united bullied them, really comfortable at the back never in danger of losing this game they made it look easy

They CAN play football, why is sheffields performance so bad this season?
I recreated this game with my Blades squad on SM21 against a title chasing Man Utd, however it is a home game. Man Utd hit the post on 51 mins. Then Bernardeschi (my new signing from that season) ran down the other end and scored what would be the only goal of the game. I went down to 10 men on 78 mins but held on for the 3 points. Match stats: Sheffield United: 5 shots, 2 on target, 2 corners Man Utd: 24 shots, 7 on target, 8 corners

Deluded English: "Man Utd lost to Sheffield because EPL is tough and competitive, Sheffield has CL level and if playing in other leagues they would be at least top 3 and would qualify for UCL but competition for CL spots is tough and competitive in EPL you know..."
Simply Fabulous Game🚩🎯⚽️⭐️❣️♦️
The book is on the table
Сколько вам кривоногим Мансити денег заплатили,чтобы так умирать на поле?
SHU first goal shoud be disallowed. It was clearly that De Gea being pushed by Sharp

Wow, look at the past week champions hahaha Very well done, Sheffield! I wish you remain in Premier League!

But Sheffield fc deserved it  Let's accept were beaten well enough. Epl is competitive and it will always be that way, unless you want it to be laliga.
Martial is too lazy
Asikk man utd kalah😂😘😘
Ole underrated the blades that's why united loss the game, play your key men in very game it counts.

Fuck Ed Woodward and OGS
It's incredible!!! Congratulations to Sheffield United from Italy.
I miss man u match on 2010 that time man u is king... Now very boring to man u game
The fact that Manchester United's YouTube Channel hasn't even uploaded the highlights for this match should tell you all about their "Glory Hunters" reputation.  However, they've uploaded highlights, pitch-side cam, post-match reaction etc etc. for their 3-2 FA Cup win against Liverpool.
Manchester United is nothing without penalties. United fans can back to their cave and wait for next win and go out to bark.
No penalty no win
Lingard > Ice Cold Martial
First goal shoulda been disallowed de Gea was fouled
Man Utd fans are disliking the video 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Sertus ribu rupiah seratus ribu rupiah sertus ribu rupiah
Utd doin Utd a favor to not have them relegated
Where was Maguire Planning to go when he scored😂😂 he ran for so long
Fun fact: Sheffield have more points in the last 5 games than Chelsea
Sheffield United 4 wins in 5 games.
ga kedinginan lg toh?
Crap. Crap. Crap. What the hell was Pogba doing during that goal, five steps away, standing stone still, closing no one
Can the blades survive in the premier League this year?

Our Problem is Ole, who doesn't have regular first team, he shouldn't shuffle his squad in EPL. Our tradition is that Young players should be given an opportunity in FA cup and English Cup.
Sheffield United, thank you and well done.   Sincerely, the whole Premier League
Bonjour, kòman nou ye?

Thank you Sheffield United!  #ManCity
diving header?
Sheffield does not deserve to be relegated
Fluke win
Lord Eddard Stark (Sean Bean) is  really proud and happy
If the first goal counts, after De Gea gets pushed in the back, then Martials goal counts as well. Either both count, or none of them. But you were better on the day in general. Well played.
Kiburi FC... Leo kimyaaaaaa!
Good job to shiffeld united..   Fucking EMYU dan Manchester united 🤣🤣🤣🖕🖕🖕
Man Utd fan speaking. Sheffield Utd have earned my respect. They showed themselves that they ain’t a side to be messed with. Excellent performance from them. They were the better team. Good luck Sheffield Utd, hope u guys bring down Oil City. :)
Manchester is blue💙💙
The best United won
God joob
Dea out please replace him
#9 left his defense at home 🏡
YOU MADE MY DAY 💙
Martial kontol
If u not play Cavani, play Mata or VDB rather martial, smh ole 🙄
fuck united !
Is Ole really that dumb? Cavani should have started ahead of Martial. Its no rocket science.. Martial should be replaced next season. He is not a centre forward
Martial go out
Who will hel  Ta Oyuan
Well done United for beating Utdiots.
Rly like sheffields commentator
Thanks Sheffield united and wish you stay away from relegation at the end of  the season.
Congrast Sheffield United FC.
Martiall out
SHU needs a proper striker, McGoldrick will take them to relegation
i can just said HAHAHAHAHAHAAHA
Thanks Sheffield
United’s ganna win the league!
Never change a winning squad! Period
Congrats  #GGMU
finally united are back but with the blade one
Sheffield United ruining United "were top of the league after 7 years celebration"
0:29 He fouls with De Gea!
U guys are cheaters
I will eat my own shit and go bald if Sheffield beat Man City
1:17 "Alex Telles into the box and, oooooo what a diving header". Yeah I'm calling bullshit on that one.
😊
Man united 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Genuine question. I wasn't watching the game did they clock 3 shots on target Fernandez Greenwood in fact, Rashfordinho and Harry's goal?
Boss oleee ayo dong beli pemain baru biar bisa mu juara tahun ini
manchester united😴
Al Fatiha
Klecon mu Iki🔥🔥🔥
Flecky beast💪💪💪
Ole clearly underestimated your team. Good job SU!
HAHAHA man united did not upload their highlight .... ohhh they didn't have one.
A reminder to Ole, "there's no small team in EPL"
0:28 ada yang dorong dorong nih Wkwkwk
Wow I am surprised😲😲😲
Keren euy
tf the end of z world is  near🤣🤣🤣
Manchester united will never win any thing as long as martial still in that line up,kick out martial now and save Manchester this humiliation.
Congratulations Sheffield
All this about sharpe fouling de ger matic gave him a push and he stumbled into the goalie
I think the commentator was really good.
Matic actually ducked for that first goal, when he should have been standing on the goal line anyway
Bring them down!
Ole don't dear drop de Gea earn to much(350/week)?And Martial is Glaziers favorit player.KThey should look for a tactical manager,Ole is is not good enough!
#GGMUNYUK
thanks for giving united a wake up call for selling martial and buying a proper centerback
Great Win Blades!
Beating the champions , 3 days later, sheffield beating them at home. there is truly one united. City will win the title at 10 points distance. second place leicester, third united, fourth chelsea (a new coach will keep the boys motivated)
Thank you sheffield
Save erick baily
I'm not an EPL fan but  Man u fans talk too much
We are in Covid-quarantine and we bet our money for Manchester United.they steal our money and give it to Bet companies..so simple..what a shame!fake match! they sold the championship.
😂🤣🤣💦💦💦
Go beat man city now
I am so happy ,thank you sheffield united,
No penalty no party
Should have been 1-3. Striker missed a really easy chance.
COME ONE
Niaw 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Man United, you're a disgrace to football, now back to being ranked below 4
Please never bet on Man United ever again Me giving advice to myself
MARTIAL IS OLE'S GOLDEN BOYS, IRREPLACEABLE......
From all the other premier league fans:Well done Sheff Utd!!
everybody respect the better united
the dislikes is Man United fans Edit: and yes i likes my own comment
MU 1-2 Sheffield https://youtu.be/6Td0hzQiDMQ
Where is the man city fans
Well Done
what the heck are united even doing i swear this was the worst game they played in years the whole match looked fixed
Just realised McGoldrick's finishing has gone back to last season
As a watford fan this is a rare win for Sheffield United and that possession and positioning of man u was so poor
Good news for Leicester and Liverpool😉😉
thanks you ..  🔵
What is wrong with this team
Terrible match  of united how is it possible to play so bad
Fred should be an undroppable
Mu goblokk anjeng, PERMAINAN MU, TERLALU SERING MEREMEHKAN TIM KECIL/DIBAWAHNYA, DGN MENURUNKAN LAPIS 1000 JEMBOT NYA
United 😂😂😂
Bye bye Manchester United
No point if we beat Liverpool one day and lose to Sheffield the next!
Mu hahahahaha
Tuanzebe scored a no look goal 😱
GG MU😂
คริๆ
Thank you for beating the noisy neighbours.
Thanks sheffield united from spurs
What the fuck🤣
Thankyou Sheffield United not void zebra fans
Come on trending
That's 4 wins in 5 games😳
You have two in form defenders Lindelof and Eric but Ole goes with Tuanzebe. And I dont get why Martial played instead of Cavani. 😣
To all the United fans, if you already didn't know, the ball is round 🤔
Boring let's win
Kings of comeback
i looove this game ..😂😂
Man United back to default settings again
kkkkk memilukan
Kiburi fc
This is the result when Man U can't get a BS pen.  Well done Sheffield.
Have to renovate the cave again. Shit man 🤭😄😃😁😆😀🤣😅
And there we are now second place. We lost a winnable game because of wrong team selection. Why start Tuanzebe when you have lindelof who is much better and knows when and what to do during defending. Again how can you start Martial when you have Cavani ready to start. Sometimes Ole needs to think twice to make good decisions.
Well done boys
Blades has slayed the devil in slo-mo  manner. Sick.....
Kerennn...
United win
Never ever start or rest your main players like lindelof. Ole knows we are not defensively strong and yet again he starts Tuanzebe who scored an own goal last time against leicester City.
Good job!
768 scums from Manchester disliking😂
Inexperience is what will kill us in the end. Thinking too much about a future game when you have a game right now is also part of what makes you silly and nonsense. Why think about Arsenal game when you can't beat typical Sheffield United team. Ole think again and let this teach you a lesson.
Biawak cetak gol mu lose
How about give players salary equal to performances, that would change these sloppy individuals such as martial. 🤬
Let´s see whether sheffield utd can do like they did today on coming match against city  I AM WATCHING !
This is made may day, so hilarious 🤣
saved from noise pollution. #DefaultSettingsMode
Nyari warga +62 yang pengen liat MU ha ha ha ha ha
From day one de gea was always a flapper when it come to corners and crosses. Fuck him off already Madrid would pay out the nose for him
The problem is Ole changing the line up too much. How can you just assume Sheffield United and go with pogba and matic. Look at you now. At the end of the day you lost the winnable game. What do you expect against Arsenal that is stronger opponent. Ole sometimes needs to think otherwise he is still inexperienced coach which will kill us
Wish that SHEFFIELD UNITED can escape from relegation because of this match XD XD XD
GGMU
The real united is sheffield...
now man city is going to win all trophies
This is the 2nd time tuanzebe is scoring an own goal , I really don't know what gets into Ole not to maintain the squad like just how Pep does , this Ole is just shit , Pep never underates a team by putting a weak squad at all
Where id billey
Manchester united when they drew with liverpool at a field and they were very happy and u wanna enjoy how liverpool will thrash spurs and shorten the gap into 3 points
MU Lost
I promise you with such centre backs i dont think there is a chance man united will win anything and then there is martial lord will only help united now
PREMIER LEAGUE IS A FIXED FUCKING LEAGUE .
love from kerala united fc 💜
thanks sheffield for saving the world  from noise pollution
Man U been chopped by blades
Lot of bets a crying i lost lot money😥
Thank u Sheffield United - Liverpool fan from Poland.
Zebras are back in form, i was worried by their recent form
nice job
Main macam puki sheffield .. defend gila babi x bagi MU masuk .. pastu attack bila ada chance ja .. mmg penakut .. lemah
Tuanzebe cost us two goals... matic lower than average, telles lack of pace ... end of January one team has 5 points, other team has 40 points, and the team with 5 points wins away... Well idk ....
Every game greenwood playing I'm wanna kill myself
Ramsdale is a keeper. Despite his age he’ll already a beast. He’ll be world class in some 5-6 years
Why didn't manchester United channel uploaded this already? 😂
Sad...🤧
Haha.  Baby.
And barcelona beat rayo yeaterday as well. Guess the small teams really are becoming strong
OLE MUST STAY!!!!
Glory glory Sheffield United~
All those dumb united fans gloating. Welcome to reality 😂😂😂😂
Thumbs up sheffield utd. Who thought you could defeat Man U.
Finally manchester United lost🤘
HOME FUCKING HOME LOSING TO SHEFFIELD FUCKING SHEFFIELD HOW THE FUCK
Big disappointment from Ole. Hope this should not be the of losing games from now on. Common United, don't let us feel down. Love from India 🇮🇳
Congratulations on the victory 1:2!!! THE BLADES SHORTENED THE DEVIL ^S  HORNS! Greetings to all the fans from StickerMan youtube channel!
Nice guys
Ole is a confused coach who doesn't understand his team and his players he is still trying to identify whom to use at the expense of the the other why did we signed Edison cavani ?? Cavani should be the first priority than martial ...and igalo in expense of rashford
Man united lose more game with weak teams that with big team
saya kesini cuma memastikan karna klub merah satu ini kalo kalah tidak ada highlighnya di chanelnya. ;)
thank u so much sheff utd ❤️
You  have done liverpool justice..
GGSU
Sheffield deserve to stay up!
was i the only one who hoped this could maybe happen?
MOTM : Tuanzebe
Very good mach
Utd fans were laughing at Liverpool when they got beat by Burnley.But losing to Sheffield, that's hilarious.
If never give up was a team... Then that's Sheffield
Nice try winning the title  man united 😄
what a stupid defender Axel Tuanzebe ...fukkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
Pogba have spikes not only on his boots, but on his head too 😁
Tim juru kunci top performance
Good job. Sheffield Utd was very composed and played as a team. I wonder why they can't keep playing like this.
Why remove the part where ramsdale rammed into slabhead? It was a important highlight
Nice shefield
Pus** 😂
This is premier league, there is never an easy match
Sheffield missed a shit-ton of clear-cut chances. I would have been sad had they not get this win.
United mode united😝
Somebody tell this man what a diving header is
Ynwa..
Thank you Sheffield! It's pretty quiet every where! No noise on any social media platform! As an LFC fan, you all deserve a bells!
Kiburi FC aye😂💯🇰🇪
Im starting to like sheffield united...xD
yeeeeeee mancity is number one
As a united have always believed we shouldn't get ahead of ourselves that we are winning the title this year. I get it that we gotta have the hope. But this team has a long way to go.
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS BRYAN IS STILL A MAN CITY UNDERCOVER PLAYER

The second goal they scored, you can see pogba is just watching and don’t defend
THIS LOSS IS THE MANAGER'S FAULT COZ YOU CANT LEAVE CVANI,FRED,MC TOMINAY,SHAW OUT. WOT DO U EXPECT.HE WAS NOT SEROIUS.HE WAS JOKING....
"Diving header" ? The commentator is having a shocker.
I like Sheffield United a lot. The team spirit is so evident. I hope they stay up

RIP Man Utd’s title challenge Jan 2021 - Jan 2021
This is another rigged game. Great win with the help of the bookies. The more unexpected the results, the more dirty money the bookies, players and the clubs gain.

The question here is...who is challenging man city for the title?
Top team lose to bottom team. It was ashamed..or team who can beat MU will be rewarded.. MU will not be a champion.. Sack Ole like Lampard. MC yes...
Man city they have send keen Bryan to stop man utd winning streak like if you agree😂
Liverpool Liverpool
"ayah apa itu kalah?" Celetukan fans MUnyuk 😂

Well done boys👍
What a famous win Sheffield. Good luck for the rest of the season.
This is Sheffield Wednesday because Won on Wednesday
glory glory manchester city........!!!!!!!!!!!
The Luck Stops Here
Manchester united tahun kemarin saja lawan tim papan bawah kalah, sekarang kalah juga . Entah kenapa kalau lawan tim papan bawah kebanyakan kalah, tapi kalau lawan tim besar atau papan tengah bisa menang .
Balik ndeso macul😁😁
Cape cape begadang... Kalah juga
Awkwkw govlog . Kalah
Hate this Frinkin game 🤬🤬🤬
Good for United
Sometimes underdogs do win
High way for city to won epl 😁😂
manchester united
Good game sheffield
This is good example of A Small one can defeat a Big one
Conglatulation..  S U  Mu good job.. 😀😀😀
This is the type of game man united would lose so I'm not that surprised but thank goodness coz that may have saved Liverpool season now we just needa beat spurs and hope Everton beat City in thier game in hand
Last beat 1st
Thanks for letting us come back to social media and getting a breathing space.❤️❤️
Martial 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Sheffield United you are cheats and I hope you get relegated!
Mas Rizal : Jogging Jogging....🚶🚶🚶
Could have milked the highlights a bit more and shown the end. Your best result of the year
Sheffield United for the league title
Bastardi pezzi di merda e stata una pastetta cornuti. Ragazzi credetemi non giocate più bollette che nel mondo del calcio ci sono na marea di truffe
Who noticed the crazy rhyme scheme in the first 8 seconds
The silence on social media is proudly brought to you by sheffield united
❗❗❗ALERT!! Saulty Man Utd Fans in the comments🔴
With all respect to the blades thank you so much for waking us (United Fans) up from a fantasy dream. You made us realize again that if you wish to win title you need to work a lot harder than this. Premier League is a tuff league and you can't underestimate anybody. You did great job teaching us this fact. Thank you. Wish Sheffield United Fans out there all the very best.
Gol ke2 telles sampahh!!!!
1:29 so used to saying “as Manchester United lead”
'burke' down man utd  i see what you did there
Thank you Sheffield I am a Liverpool fan and I was waiting for this day
Manchester disappointed us😂😂😂😂😂😂
MAN United going nowhere until the fire ole . Lets get real. They should have signed potch now he at psg . M
Enjoy your time up blades.
Mampusss MUnyuk you lose😂👎
City
Ahihihihi
Sheffield united Forever💥
thank you Sheffield United.  YNWA!!!
They really think they can hold a form like Man City lmaooo
Молодци,отдали все силы в кубке против ливерпука,а в лиге без пенки не смогли
bloody hell, we go win against liverpool in the fa cup in the weekend and then lose against a team with less points than strings on a guitar
Sorry but you can't be the Champs if you lose to the absolute worst team at home
why is the quality so shit for me
Good goal by Maguire by the way.
Unbelievable
SHU have a great performance but the first goal surely is a foul😡
It is increasingly clear, there are 5 MU players who must be on the bench. De Hea, Axel T, Alex T, Matic and Martial.
Manutd has a terrible coach
Martial out Cavani in.
Whenever manchester loses i feel so comfortable it made my night.
who say united did not win
Thank you Sheffield United! From a Spurs fan 😂
Josss
great job guys finally  i can enjoy my peace  this week
Martial : "let them win this time, guys..."
MU tuh..gk konsisten setiap kali main..jadi sama club papan bawah aja bisa kalah...untuk juara liga inggris..klo mainnya masih  turun naik bgitu gk mungkin terjadi ..🥴🥴
Pucuk dingin pucuk dingin, akhirnya longsor🤣
I have started petition to give Sheffield 6 points for their win.
At 1:30 the commentator was about to say man u took the lead!
You cant find this video in ManU's channel. They can accept lose things, so pity.  That should be 3-1 btw.
As I predicted. As MU fan I'm delighted at the progress we've made. But knowing our current squad inconsistency, Ole's mysterious strategies or unnecessary mangling with starting lineup, I'm mentally prepared for this lost. Normally bottom teams will fight harder as they hv nothing to lose.
Thank you sheffield, not a sheffield fan but seeing Manutd lose is so satisfying
McGoldrick is not a footballer. And that's why Sheffield Utd are at the bottom of the table.
BORN UNITED, WIN OR LOSE I SUPPORT MAN UTD♥️ 😈
Just look ! Don't gambling ?!
Mogitkant gundoba manchestero
WTF how could McGoldrick miss that?
ole now  stop talking shit your tactic is one game win  the next lose .  even u do not know what this game means for us u do not deserve to coach  our team . i said fuck u  , u are idiot coach .  do u give chance to  play for tuanzebe in this kind of crucial game ? why did not u play like  shaw  ,fred , lindolf and cavani in first half do u tell us your reason  ?
Haha tim bodoh kalah
Thank you shieffield
Where's Neville? Manchester United hasn't uploaded the match highlights yet? The BURN is real :D
#GGMU
Congratulations to Sheffield United. You’re the real United today.  From MU fan.
Proud of you boys👏!!
Just a little thing ,😂😂😂
Those 3 points will haunt us one day n we will regret soh if we are real contenders ole should stop fucking up n start right players all along there's reason why matic ain't playing n martial cut me some slack he's has the worst mentality ever
Hahaha bruno appealing for a handball
Kawal terus MANCHESTER CITY
Tuanzebe ngowoh
Well done,, finally you can win,, congrate sheffield you beat ones the big six
Wow the noise neighnours are now number 1
Need to start Dean Henderson instead
Our fridge had scored 🔥🔥 the come back was on but in the end tuzebebe ruined it😢😢😖 I hope City lose the match against shefiled 👍
That a normal results for Sheffield
I don't know why this coach will never start cavani ,u have a dangerous striker yet u keep leaving him outside
Thanks Sheffield 🔥
Kembali ke goa
Martial yesss
0:35 why i hear penandesss..
And Manchester United fans had a go at us Arsenal supporters on AFTV for drawing a match away from home a couple of weeks ago. At least we didn't lose against the bottom team at home ha ha! Good on you The Real United beating Man U!
NEPAL number 1 country. namaste
United back in form
This would have been a good bet since no one expected Man U to lose
1:04 I can't believe he missed that. Could have easily made it 2:0
Sheffield United 🔥💪👏👏👏
Haha shit man u
What that was i dont have word for this this is not normal i dont belive how Man u play with play like this one we dont have chance for anything this is frustraiting shame Man U shame😩
Why does Jr Pendu point at the referee even the score is fine and against him?
GLORY.. GLORY SHEFFIELD UNITED.. GLORY.. GLORY SHEFFIELD UNITED.. 💪✌️👌🌼😘🤣🤗
The commentators were praising Manchester United till the end of the game ... couldn't believe that
Good Job Sheffield
Aw poor old varchester utd they mustn't have paid their var subscription 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Winning over a trash team wasn’t that great
United win the match, ah sorry, i mean Sheffield United win the match 🤣
Man u:we are the king of comebacks Sheffield :who said  so 😁😁😂
Martial is not working hard. A striker should be aggressive. Every time he loses ball he never chases, infact keeps on disappointing himself. Replace him with sancho, i bet manu wont regret. I am really disappointed to see his (martial) play these few games...sic
Thanks shieffield, from man city fan
Bek nya ke tai
Thank you Sheffield!   From Spurs Fan
An unpredictable dismal performance from man untd team,Martial should not play in our fixtures
You all are still going to get relegated. No you won that match
Kembali stelan pabrik(lawak)
Anzd it's Fernandez ...ow it's Greenwood 😂😂
Sama juru kunci Mu ko
How much does Man U have to fix into from a gambling ??💵💵
*The best United won*
😂😂 Banyak yg gk tembus lagi parlay nya gara gara Emyu
Teruskan bekerja dengan gaji besar dan usaha yang mengerikan ... Fantastic mencret dech 👍🥳
Martial use sharingan to amaterasu the ball 😂
Great performance vs a BTech Manchester Team
Sheffield's reserves beat Manchester United's main team 😂😂

Congratulations on the 2-1 win over MU, greetings from Indonesia
puCUuukk dIiingiiiinNNn
*kalian jahat*
😂😂😂😂
Utd back in form!
MU kembali ke DNA asli
Bad performance from ole, why martial? We have Cavani..
Every player ( especially Man U) would demand “give me 1 million if I score 5 goals , 2 million if I wear Man U jersey , bonus 30 million for signing , weekly wages 400,000 during negotiations, if I was the manager I would secretly insert a clause that if the player doesn’t perform well that week, the player will take only 10% of the salary and would pay a sum of 10 million to the club for his poor performance, and then we can win the entire 38 games in the league and iam a Man U fan
😀
😝mu
I've officially gone back to coma again.
Ada yang terpleset, tapi bukan karena pisang! 😊
GGMU ❤️
Sheffield saves MANUTD fans from cold
AHAHAHA As a city fan, this is the funniest thing I've ever seen! Exactly what We needed, Sheffield clap United and we go up when we beat Sheff. Just watch out "ReD DeVilS" We have already won!
Thank you
Martial must GO!!!
Can u take me in your team I am all rounder
Well Done  BOYS!!
Kesalahan saoskjer tidak memainkan mctominay dengan memainkan kan matic pakai yang manual aj bos jngn matic seharunya strategi lawan liverpool d pakai lgi

Other teams lose 1 game: its just 1 game they will come back Man utd lose a game: they suck they dont know anything they will not be in top 4 Yet when man utd win these people disappear
Glory Glory Sheffield United 😂😂
Ramsdale looks like he played on 200 ping on that Maguire goal

Greenwood you had motiple chance but you failed
When manu win they will praise maguire, rashford, mctominay, bruno, but when the lose, they always blame pogba, de gea, martial, lindelof. Hypocrite.
Credit to shefield
As a Manchester City fan,from bottom of my heart thank you so much Sheffield united 💙💙💙💙🙏🏾💯
I hate you Sheffield utd
before match : turun dulu mau beli indomie after: beli indomie persiapan buat di goa
Tak pikir wingi menang em yu , ehh lah kok kuwalik 🤣🤣🤣🤣
How did he allow martial goal if l was there I  would jump on the reffere  and tear of his shirt off for not allowing that goal
This result make FA (Fergie's Assistant) angry and going to plan some penalty after final whistle again
Thanks Sheffield for shuttingb downMan United fans shit talking mouth 🤣🤣🤣

Center bek lindelof real NOB!!!

Now we understand what United can do without penalty . . . . #GoodjobBlades
Wkwkwkwk pogba martial de gea against.. Ole2
Harry Maguire ? Who is he ? Soon be doing time in a Greek prison.!
Great job guys...🔥🔥
degea degea
ㅋ
U broke my heart 💔 sheffield united
Harry and Ole moaning about the ref... That's rich considering the descions Utd have got this past couple of seasons and they've still won nothin! Nothing wrong with the first goal the boy doesn't touch De Gea in fact De Gea pushes him in the back as it's taken. Slab head would want to take a good look at himself for the winner it was his weak clearance initially that that gave the ball to the Blades 3 yards from goal and the goal came from that.
Que injusto ese resultado el manchester united fue mucho mejor  no se refleja en el resultado y además el manchester united es un equipo con historia el que mas títulos tiene en Inglaterra y el sheffield united que un equipo que nunca a ganado nada y que a estado más en segunda división. Muy mal equipo y que ganó de suerte este partidos
Many blessings fall down to you
🐘  top of the 🌲 😂😂😂😂😂
Lmao good
Terima kasih berkatmu city pucuk💓
MALAYSIA PARAMEDIC FARED WORST AMONG COUNTRIES IN ASIA FOR FIGHTING COV19 Then how Tan Sri should answer the media. WTF? Credit were all taken by paramedic after praised by the people and even promised would subdue the next outbreak but now blame the people for being useless after daily patients breached 4k per day.  Inshort, no one should ever justify Malaysian paramedic were better than those in Indonesia or Italy, based on new patient perday. Cos paramedic between nation have nothing different unless their equipment inview of technologies.  If not, you mean paramedic in Malaysia very hardworking, work very fast or very efficient when containing outbreak, compared to those in India, US and Brazil or nation that daily patient could breach 150k..  Cos malaysian were indeed lucky during 1st lockdown or how their highway jammed for two days, caused by hometown movement which cannot be seen in other nation.  Sure Tan Sri unaware of such event could somehow paralysed the pandemic yet should remember, how WHO and Health Ministry stand out with their prediction on when the disease would peak from mid April till end of June but ended up with 5 patients in August. Inshort, paramedic should not taken credit without any understanding..  The question, do Tan Sri dare or not, allow malaysian went back hometown during Chinese New Year? You dont want to see, how the disease paralysed. If yes, mean you need to trust the people since general knowledge about hometown movement would flare outbreak were just a theory. A theory that only happen before in Malaysia during 1st lockdown but somehow showing adverse result.  Cos urban and rural area have huge diferences inview of density or why disease spread easier in urban area since people living in big city were like sardine packed. And if the people allowed to move back to hometown during festival, mean they would aware why family need to go separate way, if among them someone were sick, for the mean of survival since medical centre only concentrated in urban area. . That is the significant factor or how the disease paralysed when density of hotspot were reduced tremendously by hometown movement and indirectly causes the disease jammed, like how fire died off by itself since nothing else exist nearby so they could keep burning. Cos whoever left behind were those that already infected or how someone figured out, why Malaysia COVID19 behave so passive during 1st lockdown, compared to other countries.. Paramedic? Their efficiency in handling outbreak till causes pandemic in Malaysia behave passive, only exist in Tan Sri mindset, not those that use their sense to live their life. Get it? (Google "Danny Woo Vk" in Bing for Granny Method that could cure COV19 without going to hospital)  THE SUN SAID JEWS AND SINGAPORE  CONFIRMED BURN BEFORE JUDGEMENT DAY FOR 2ND MOON SURVIVAL
Keano bryan we love you fam once a blue always a blue
Good win sheffield. The big question  how Ole  make  so much changes  especially  around at the back. Strange  one Ole.

Martial stupid snake
Bruno, City had been long party after this night, long night for u..glad to see your performance, Its because Ole out from Mou style, you can win if u parking 9 Bus in 16 area with high discipline and as ussual you can send long ball or long pass to your OMF...
LMAO.. Leipzig knocked out them in UCL and now their PL streak is ended by a former Leipzig player.
https://youtu.be/01MZiUEH-LU
What a great game👍😁👏👏👏
Haha mu kalah
0:29,  should have been a foul, the result shoud be at the worst 1-1, sheffield won with only luck
How could my day start better as a Liverpool fan😂😂
Sheffield berharap imbang aj gapapa.. malah menang..wkwkwk
fernandes blames shaw
I’m so happy this morning 😂😂 I mean their past 6-7 EPL performances were horrible.  I mean wolves villa Fulham  all were so lucky  Even against Southampton last minute   From Liverpool fan 😛
You'll never walk alone...
Hahahahahha
Penaldes😂😂😂
come on, don't let them on the top.
Time não respira nada só serviu pra atrapalha a vida do Manchester United.
And people thought this only happens to Liverpool, this is the EPL any team can shine any day, never underestimate any of these teams. As for Liverpool, their defense is so disseminated with injuries that they have to play 19 year old from their junior  teams.
Pelanggaran Cok jancok gol pertama
City still leading thanks to Sheffield
Man U aren't going to post the highlights since they lost
no penalty  no win
Ole out
👏👏👏👏👏

Mcgoldrick is such a pussi for missing that 1 on 1...
Just subbed
I did not watch the match because before the match I heard commentary that Sheffield only have six players the rest are out due to COVID and suspensions. SO I did not feel the need to watch because it was like a walk over for Man Utd, only to see this
And MU is too shy to share the highlights, Congratulations Sheffield United. (City Fan... From Colombia)
