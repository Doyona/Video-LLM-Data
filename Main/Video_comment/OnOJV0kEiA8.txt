Don't ask a question if you don't want the honest answer.
Lazy players sees José as a bad Manager.
I tell you what's change the level of money ! When Blackburn won the title Jack walker at the time was able to buy the club the best but then the big clubs caught up. The Next time a huge jump was Abramovich and he was able to buy the best with José before the rest caught up and again the next time a even richer tycoon....Man City.  Leicester was different but it still need a billionaire investor to build that club but the squad and team spirit was what won it . Big clubs are wanting success there and then and expect to buy it but unless you have the level of money as City you are not going to get it. Leeds are no where as rich as the big clubs but the right manager and hard work with a championship side we hope to build on that but it takes time. If Pepe Gaurdiola been at other clubs and didn't get the result would he have the same amount of time?
Sky sport is like CNN. What a waste of talent, not they are part of a propaganda machine to target players and managers. They are now a tool. It's like growing up and learning that WWE is staged.
Punditry is so stupid sometimes. What is jaw-dropping about him speaking bluntly on a toxic relationship that was publicized?
Lampard described the same thing. When you're injured or out of favour Jose just ignores people to try and get them to push harder to get back to top level. That confrontational style used to work but player power has changed these days
Paul Pogba is truly a Virus. He's too stubborn and influences other players wrongly.  A coach should be allowed to do his work. No player should greater than his club. If not for Pogba's wickedness,  Morinho would have brought more trophies to Manchester United.  Paul Pogba is very ungrateful to a man/coach that has consistently shown confidence in black players.  It's unfair.
Because players are divas now.
LOL...absolutely NOTHING "jaw dropping" about the comments
Mourinho can’t manage in the PL anymore... too many English players in across all teams and it infects the other foreign players too. he’s too outdated for it and they’re too distant from him. He needs to have a “manly” team. A team like Bayern or Juve could potentially suit him. He can’t work with these new generation, glued to social media and pissing about players. He need the likes of Lampard, Drogba, Ramos, Ronaldo etc. to drive the team on and off the pitch. There’s minimal players like that around in the PL... The English unfortunately seem to have one of the unhealthiest, possibly THE unhealthiest relationship with social media and just growing up in general in compassion to other countries across europe and even the world... that’s part of the reason why the likes of Bellingham, Sancho etc are doing so well abroad... they’re not around the clown environment the PL players are...
Jaw dropping 🤣 such a shock that someone expressed there opinion,  when asked a question lol
TBH Pogba's candid away of responding to questions should be applauded
It's contract renewal time...
thats some rigid milking
I think Jose will go to Italy again and be successful. Couldn't understand him taking the Spurs job. Spurs. That's all I need to say. Spurs. They're like Arsenal now or Arsenal are now like Spurs. *Reality is, both clubs aren't big enough to succeed without a benefactor.*
Ornstein!?!? Who da fook is that guy
Ornstein must be stupid or an asskisser....to not believe it
Why you taking this as a shot now
jaw dropping? really?
Jose is the only one that can answer why he doesn't last at clubs and is a short term manager?? Says the plank on the top right. These guys are paid to appear on these programes and he comes out with that nonsense!! Mourinho falls out with players and ultimately the club when things don't go his way, this is the reason he doesn't last at clubs - and it's been obvious to anyone who watches football since his time at Madrid. Sky might have most of the Premier League coverage but most of the clowns they have on these shows are awful.
I mean. Mourinho publicly shamed him, what do you want him to say? FYI, sky sports is washed up.
Theres a whole pandemic going on and this is jaw dropping?
Get a life! (Saying to myself than to these peeps.)
When I read the title I thought David thinks Pogba's comments were Jaw-dropping. But what he meant was, talking against some other player/manager/ some other human in general in front of the camera is jaw-dropping.  Otherwise even they all agree something is currently strange in the way Mourinho is managing his players.   So anyway, I personally believe Mourinho will get sacked soon. Never liked him as a manager. Back when he was in United, I tried to support him. But soon after we lost 0-4 to Chelsea during his 1st year of managing United, I lost my faith in him.   Again, this is what I think and believe. :)
Funny how we didn't hear the question to Pogba but only the same clip of his response circulating.  I hope people start holding the media responsible for their planned controversy. They are the major problem allover the world.
There's 4 people here discussing the comments of a skilled, yet insolent player's comments.  2 questions: who leads, the coach or the players? Who should/would be following or going against, the coach or the players or Pogba?  When you promote behaviours and comments like that of Pogba, you contribute to making a mess of discipline in our world today.
dont understand why it is jaw dropping . this has happened during joses tenure previously at madrid chelsea man united and now at tottenham
Shame on you Sky Sports!
HEATED JAW DROP IS IT???
Just waiting for Graeme Souness to chime in
Journalists are 🤡
So Pogba must lie just cause of his profile and mourinho profile?  This guy needs to grow up, nothing malicious was said by Pogba
What Pogba said was a long time coming!
Who comes up with these titles, totally absurd by far Not jaw dropping
Sky Sports how dumb do you think we are?
He wud be in a grave if he done that to Fergie
mourinho have a bad mouth and he should be fire。
Sly News ...embarrassing panel
What was point doing this interview in first place?  Plus talking about your ex boss for no reason at all.
767th comment
These modern players need to man up. Acting like they are still getting breast fed from there mother titties  As far ole not treating players badly Mata & Van De Beek  David Moyes treated Wifred Zaha bad  LVG treated Zaha, Nani, Hernandez, Kawaga a lot of United players bad  Golden boy Pep treated  Yaya Toure & Augero bad
Sky get two or three sentences out of Pogba and make an absolute mountain out of a molehill. You’re not leading the charge in cutting edge journalism, Sky. You’re just milking a story that’s old news.
Jaw dropping?? Nothing jaw dropping about this
It's hardly hard to work out that Mourinho throws certain players under the bus. Only sky sports can be surprised by this.
Mourinho used to be THE man manager, THE manager you wanted to play for, but then he came back to England, to Chelsea, where he had changed, his personality changed to angry, moody Mourinho, he fell out with the team and notably the physio. He went to Man Utd and fell out with players there and again was angry, moody Mourinho. He is not the beloved manager that players want to play for anymore.
In 10 years it will be Pogba  who? We will still be talking about Mourinho.
Funny as.. supports a winless manager over a winning manager..how amusing.. anyone feel free to tell me who the manager was when pogba won trophies at utd??????
Who cares what ornstein thinks?
PP found true love 💘 Hopefully it's last long for decades 🥴 boxer !
There's nothing jaw dropping about this. Everybody knew this.
Jose has been sacked more in the last decade than he’s won trophies and yet he talks about what he’s won and how great is. Great managers are also excellent man managers and Jose simply can’t adapt. He is not a great manager anymore he’s a yesterday’s man
He basically repeated what everyone already knew about Mou.
Funny how people were not surprised when jose called shaw “brainless” it really doesn’t get more dehumanizing than that. But no one said a word because its jose😂
What an insightful take
Lol y’all take everything too seriously that was just the truth communication is key in life
David Ornstein's jaw be dropping everyday then
Not jaw dropping....sky stop being an clickbait queen. Pogba was honest....he simply said both Ole and Mourinho were winners but they have different styles in managing players.
Ridiculous click bait title.. yall can do better
Theres nothing jaw dropping about this
VDB, Tuanzebe, Baily when he is fit...
Pogba should worry about justifying that world class fee/wages United put up, and not kicking someone when they’re down. Jose is a head case but he also does have a full trophy case.
They aren't jaw dropping. It's Jose, that's who he is. You guys asked him and he answered honestly.
if I am Paul I will allow Jose mourinho to be n face my business which is playing football creating problems pays no one
poor journalism..
Pig a telling the truth and people are shocked  That’s the woke culture we live in
Pogba did nothing wrong .he was ask a question and he answered it.he was humble and honest. Why so bla bla on that.
Pogba biggest wanker going he hasn’t fulfilled his potential at all since he came for 90m and 400k a week has had a handful of decent games and everyone says world class !!!! Worry about ur own game without slagging Jose off!!
always been a toxic and overrated manager.
Jaw-dropping comments??  Jose Mourinho is a has been...
Mark McAdam rarely comes to the table with anything new or authentic. Just a master of recycling narratives. Classic "Don't ask me I don't know, ask Mourinho" ok thanks for that Adam, why you being paid to be on the show then?
Why’s he over exaggerating
Mourinho is your best mate when things are going well but when results start slipping he becomes a child and throws a temper tantrum. He's not emotionally mature enough to stay at a club long term, he doesn't know how to bring a new batch of young players through the ranks. He's a great tactician but his man management skills need alot of work. He knows all this and that's why he only stays at clubs short term.
Jaw dropping? More like jaw droppingly obvious
Jaw Dropping?  WTF?
Ok so now I know David Ornstein overreacts.
Mourinho is not well liked by many top players because he is not a top coach anymore and a toxic napoleon isnt suited to managing modern players.  That leads to fallouts.  Mourinho is better as a pundit nowadays...
Mourinho cant handle millenial footballers. Even Fergie's "hairdryer treatment" would be seen as bullying today. Different generations need different types of coach i guess.
Jeeezes and we are back again!! Jaw dropping haha Media milking this as per usual!!!
Ben asken vs jake paul fight yeaaa boy football is for gay boys huckles
Why is woman there?
The hosts voice is disgusting
The IGN of football
I think the difference with Terry n lampard was that they put the club first before anything so if Jose annoyed them once they would get on with it
OLE is puppet controlled by Fergie.
Man United is irrelevant
I’m glad Pogba is nowhere near my club
Silly boy, focus on your game which is always inconsistent
Jaw dropping 😂😂😂
Mourinho is so stubborn lool and shows so much attitude when you say something he disagrees with
But he is still a more successful manager for Man United than Ole at the moment. In fact I believe if Mourinhon stayed longer Man U would have been challenging for the EPL if not having won it. He never got the backing of the board like Ole does, even though in two seasons he won 3 trophies and now after two seasons Ole hasn't won anything. Yes Pogba may be happier but they aren't winning and winning is all that matters.
Whose the token blonde ?
David talking out of his ass
All Chelsea managers are short term managers
Jaw dropping ?. Sky sports has got the viewers but still king of the clickbait headlines😬
Mou's reply: "I couldn't care less."
I just subscribed to sky sports smh
4:27 - jaw dropping comment
Pogba only spoke the truth. Since Mourinho left Inter he has had all sorts of players he’s been terrible with
Mourinho needs hardwork, commitment, and dedication. Pogba is just a "Gobar" as man. No matter how much talent he has, he is one of the lowest player and human to me.
What a load of waffle about nothing
"I shidded and farded!" -Pogba. Jaw dropping comments.
A lot of the comments suggest that some people  don’t seem to understand why Pogba’s comments are jaw-dropping because “we knew this about Mourinho already”, etc. Well they’re jaw-dropping because you never hear something like this from a player/manager.   Football is so closely guarded/secretive that you never hear someone come out in the open and talk so candidly about such a situation. That’s why Pogba’s comments are causing a stir and frankly I’m delighted that he spoke out!
"What I have with The Ole...." 🤣🤣🤣🤣
You just said he won the cup then said he can't manage anymore straight after hahah  absolute media garbage..
Love how sky sports has such a strong agenda against pogba
Jose ONLY RESPECT PROFESSIONAL PLAYERS who want to succeed. When a player think he can do all he wants because he is above the team.....Jose has the balls to put grab money non consistent players in their place and not sugar coat. It is only fair. A manager is under pressure for results and players need to give everything. If not, they need to be exposed.They earn professional money,  they need to perform on same level of their wages as well as follow coaching team tactics.
If your "jaw dropped" then you're either a journalist or pundit or tabloid purveyor... nothing major that everyone didn't know here ...
UK media biasing for a jogger. Heh..nothing new here
Why are they "jaw-dropping comments"? Every man and his dog knows this.     you gotta milk this as much as you can, I guess. 👍
I think the "jaw dropping" thing is an exaggeration of how he thinks about Pogba's action, not the comment itself. If you think Pogba's comment shows how Mourinho is, it doesn't. In fact, it shows how Pogba is. Bad mouthing an old boss is never a trait of someone who takes responsibilities in his own life and action. Pogba made it seems like he's completely innocent. He's not.   Look at how many bad headlines Pogba has made. Remember the whole thing with his agent? Bow down to his talent and shrug off bad attitude ... no wonder United has no culture in their club. Sir Alex wouldn't keep these guys around the team.
"jaw dropping"   bruuh
Telling it how it is!!! We all know what Mourinho is like so why is this a shock?
You just know that every single one of these guys has no idea what good football is
Jose 2 champions league Pogba 0 😅
well it was Pogba's truth of whatever happened between them
If you dish it out then you have to expect to get it back now and again!!
Pogba like a lot of other players are like baby's who cry after a bit of criticism. They get huge money and are pemperd like little girls. Pogba is average on a good day and awful on a bad day.
Clickbait
Galvanized
Almost 4/5th of the video is about them "making something of Pogba's comments"
He won trophies with Jose, Won Nothing with Ole 🤔
They wil turn this against pogba trust me
You don't say that openly about a manager or a fellow professional because he might be your manager again someday
Different levels or management simple as that.. mourinho might look bad & ole look good but the trophies speak for them selfs.  nice guys finish last.
Parasites  Anything for a story.
Mourinho hasn't spoken to his wife in weeks because she put 1 sugar in his coffee instead of 2
Pogba says it how we already knew it was. This wasn't a secret, this was just him laughing at Joses nature like it's public news.
Jaw dropping? Come off it.
You don't do that. He's acting like a heartbroken little girl. Disrespectful little spoiled brat
Stop gassin.. he never said ANYTHING we ALL dont already know about Mourinho ... "jaw dropping"?? smh!
jaw dropping 😂😂😂. Just a wet drip of a man
Lmfao can't wait for jose presser lol mino will start shortly too 😂
Times have changed and so have players! When Jose first started, players were fearful of the coach/manager and the coach had total power/control just like Sir Alex did at Man U. But now, with the big money in the game, the power has shifted to the players and Jose has to adapt and change his ways. He cannot behave like he is still managing the Porto team of 2002-2004. Prime example is the way he is treating both Delli Alli and Gareth Bale so unless he changes and quickly evolves his management style, then he would quickly find himself unemployed again.
Sky sports digs up the footage where Mourinho and Pogba walk by each other ... 👀 jaw dropping.  Even espn fc won’t touch this.
Jaw-dropping? Lmao. Everyone and their mama knew this was the case ffs. Skysports trying to sensationalize news
Still United most successful manager since SAF! "Respect"
I know because  mourino is bipolar 🙄
I'm pleased to report that my jaw remains well intact after hearing Paul's comments about Mou
Teams come together because they have a shared enemy. Jose! LOL
What pogba did is absolutely unacceptable... you don’t come publicly to speak negative about someone that’s part of your silver ware medals.. all these negativity about someone at service and can make him definitely have a bad profile. Talking about him like that doesn’t make you saint either. So sort yourself. Just patiently waiting for jose reply
This comment was brought to you by the athletic
I wonder how many times a Fortune 500 company will allow your inconsistencies before you get fired.
Sky really have the most basic and pointless people saying a string of words don’t they..
He's just telling it like it is. I would do the same in my job as would everyone else, why is he different?
Look at these no names trying to become popular with sky. "Jaw dropping" calm down
"jaw dropping comments" ?
Why is Ben Mitchell there ?
What is jaw dropping about the truth? You guys are behaving like you don't  know and have never heard this before. All Paul said was to echo what you guys say around your kitchen table and when the cameras are off. Come on sky sports go get some news worthy stories and b stop milking what you already know.
typical media tactics for ratings...this is no surprise that Jose and Paul had a rocky relationship and it showed...Jose can be a sarcastic ass
We love Jose mourinho . For me he is the best coach in the world. Every one speaks of him. He is so naturally gifted. A genius. Eto, zlatan, Terry, lampard, drogba, xabi, modric etc all love him so who cares about what pogba thinks.
Am I the only one who thinks Ornstein looks a little bit like Arnott from Line of Duty?
What jaw dropping 😂😂😂 everyone knows this things about that dinosaur. The guy is finished
Interesting thing coming from a dude who's never led any team to win except for when he played for Mourinho
Jaw dropping? Give me a break  you hack!
Three things that are sure in this life: Taxes Death  Skysports strying oil in a frying pan.
Mourinho will be happy - this will distract from Tottenham not getting results
He answered the question... That's it
Everyone knows/knew this...
say what he wants, mourinho won Europa league, pogbas last trophy, also man uniteds last trophy, he came 2nd and got the sack
For once the pundits have to not be bias. Pogba and Mourinho get sm abuse from these nobody pundits and now they are against each-other and they cant pick a side.
They will replay this and “analyze” it till sentiment turns against Pogba which will highlight why players aren’t honest across media platforms. 🍼🍼🍼
Modern players don't want to submit to authority, they want their manager to be a supportive parent who just tells them they're great. When criticized, they throw their toys out the pram and stop trying until the manager gets sacked. It's amazing...
Im sorry but, who tf is David Ornstein anyway
Jose called Pogba a virus, how are Pogbas  coments surprising? Jose deserves it he keeps throwing players under the bus when it's his tactics that lose him games.
i didnt drop my jaw, not once!!!!  i smiled the entire time.
jaw dropping' do me a favour...
Sky why don’t you just admit you have a racist agenda and if this was a white player would be nothing of it. Anything to get views 😔
Jose said he should have been sent off in the spurs game thinks he can say what he wants good on pogba
4 douchebags with not much going on in their lives..Fookin milkmen
Sky sports trying to create a rivalry between those 2 club managers players
I love that so much ❤❤
surprised? oh yea because Jose has always had such wonderful relationships with previous players clubs and owners. infact Jose is known as the one of the moment palletable easy going and harmonious ppl in football
Hahaha, oh boy. Ornstein is really on the Mourinho wagon. Probably trying to get a promotion from his crap journalism.
They ask him the question... Then make a big deal of his answer
Everyone knows how Shaw was treated. Also, Jose stripped Pogba of the captaincy, so what did you think he would say?
Mourinho's ignorant, let's see how he likes being slagged off
Bs!Leave pogba alone
How is this jaw dropping? Pogba cares more about his haircut than Man Utd. Pogba is a waste of oxygen
Really no one talks about fellow players and coaches are we going to forget the god zlatan and pep? Go home sky u r drunk
Can't wait for this to be featured on Sky Sports Retro once any of the mentioned people in the video move to another club, retires, or controversy with other people in the video.
NAH SHUT THE F UP U DUMBASS
Come on sky all this spit screen standing in the kitchen videos need too stop now. Get inn the studio why don't ya!!! Smh
Those who know so little love to talk like they know so much
child abuse  deposition  related  son  .   FA  or  EPL  have to  check  ole gunnar's  serious comment.
Pogba says something small, the world blows it up.   Adidas: 🤑🤑 put paul on a billboard, lets milk it.
Nice to see this side of Pogba.
We gonna hear about this till next christmas aint we?
To be fair, Paul's comments weren't even that bad.....we all know they fell out, 'jaw dropping' comments are you kidding me? Jose used to openly slag off his own players so why can't Paul make a light comment about it?
Madrid changed him
Jose deserves it he's a nobody he done nothing for pogba ha ole has transformed him this season and last
And this is why youtubers are taking over from these outdated fools
Jose was a fraud fair play to Paul the only guy that has balls to say it love that guy 😉
Glad that Pogba bluntly showed Mourinho's true colors...
Someone wants Mourinho hired. Sky Sports is bored because they are not covering European football.
How old is Roy Hodgson? Don't hear players digging him out.
Jose's gonna be pissed. He already has to deal with Dulux. 😭🤣
Haha check the presenter pure drooling from the mouth 😂😂
This is why more players aren't honest about stuff, who cares what he said he was just saying what we already know anyway
This is fax look what he did with OZIL at real Madrid and look what he is doing to dele alli
Orny’s got one fantastic looking jaw btw
It's funny how pogba says this. I'm very sure VDB would love to tell us how "Good man" Ole is treating him.....
Mourinho is fading
They had to ring up Ornstein for this 😅. Sky is becoming the daily mail sports that coverage. It’s getting hard competing with young content makers.
Just ask Dele ffs
Shut up no wonder he wants to live because you English press don’t learn how to shut up
JAW DROPPING????.......i think not.
Now we need Alli, Shaw, Martial and even the players at Chelsea in his second stint there to back Pogba up. Those players, including Hazard stopped playing for him. The dressing room took a stand by losing games to get him outta there 😂
Well done to Sky Sports, they've realised that milking and making stories up is way easier than actual reporting
Jaw dropping? Give me a break lmao
I mean this is normal Jose Behaviour at this point, why is anyone surprised.. He done it with Pogba and Luka Shaw at United, Dele Alli at spurs,  Iker Casillas and Pepe at Madrid, Quaresma at Inter.. the list goes on. I guess Pogba is just the first one to actually call him out
Why nobody is scrutinizing Ole's trophy chances.........
Well it was nearly happing with alli so I could see it happen happened with Chelsea players man u and even inter u could see players just disappearing in fact is mata not one of the players
"jaw dropping comments" ...this is why fans dont respect old-school media pundits and reporters....they are more like gossip rag....they will milk any news stay relevant......good riddance ....glad we have other options.
Pogba is a boss, media always on his nuts
Employee talks about ex colleague/manager.  Where is the story ??
Listen he's speaking his truth you guys ask the question. Don't be surprised when a player is honest.
Pogba: Ole wouldn't pretend that they don't exist. Donny Van der Beek: i'm gonna pretend I didn't hear that.
McAdam is a trash pundit, just says repeats what we know 🤦🏽‍♂️
The vultures are out
Mourinho did it to shaw as well and now delle and rose at spurs.
Bcoz Jose freaking proven winner compared to Ole who's so soft to take any big decision...
Jose Mourinho is overrated
I don't think José changed, I think players did. Today's players are much bigger prima donnas and are treated as if they're employers, rather than employees. What we have here is a worker who said he didn't like his old boss and a bunch of school girls calling it "jaw-dropping" and running around the playground like it's outrageous news.
His comments really weren't that deep. Y'all capping.
Jaw dropping 😅🤣😂 honestly the English media are a joke
Really wasn’t that bad
You are just not used to hearing anyone near you telling the truth then. Good to know.
Sky Sports take on this matter is disappointing
feel bad for spurs payers then.. eek
Let wait for Mourinho
Modern players are soft,bunch of fairies want to be cuddled and praised all the time,the older generation was more like men they got same treatment you would get in a 9-5 job,where the manager will not always praise you but tough love to make you better,when you do good you don't really hear any appraisal but when you do wrong you're going to know about it,mourniho is like one of those hard ass bosses in most unrelated football jobs.Players can't handle the tough love and some of the players cry about it or in other ways can't be bothered to make the effort for the team
Will the animosity between Mourihno and Pogba ever be eliminated?
David Ornstein is a wanker
pogba's the man
Sky shamelessly milking the whole situation 🤦‍♂️
How have Sky made such a big deal out of Pogba simply stating the obvious, refreshing to hear a footballer talk openly for once
Pogba said what we already knew. It was a well known that Mourinho and he had a falling out. Shaw would definitely say the same thing
I just hope he doesn't win anything with Ole. I can already see in a few weeks time, if Man U does not win Europa League, Mourinho will just have one of his beautiful replies like "Well Pogba can like Ole more than me, BUT at least he won titles with me"
AGENDA!!!!! Sky Sports you guys are pathetic!!!!
This type of media reaction is why all players and managers are robotic and boring in press conferences 😂
lol i hate this kind of attacks but Jose last remark about Son diving.. i hate him
The thing with Mourinho is that he is that strict father figure that got the best out of players who grew up with a sense of pride and graft and a chip on their shoulder that would lead to them doing whatever it takes to get positive acknowledgement from him. The generation of players from Paul's era to the present is mainly consisting of soft materialistic prima donnas who are used to kicking and screaming and getting their way with a lack of shame and courage. Mourinho has tried to adapt with Spurs but his tactics on the pitch haven't and things as of now seem to be imploding on him yet again as United/Second spell Chelsea Mourinho rears his head from the amount of pressure.
Good luck Man U. Pogba plays when he wants. After Europa league you wont see him again lol
Sky and the media on a whole trying to force a false narrative "mourinho doesn't gel with MODERN players" go back to his days at Madrid, half the dressing room hated him it's nothing new. Pogba was also prompted in every single question you asked him he didn't say a malicious word about him
There is nothing jaw dropping about this.
Still tryna live off Jose's name...🥱🤦‍♂️
The truth should never told.... Refreshing.
Legendary moments players managers
"jaw-dropping"?? Media trying to make some drama. Cliiiick
Rooney said exact same thing about rooney
Jaw dropping? Everyone knew already what Mourinho is all about lol
"Jaw dropping".  Absolutely unbelievable.  Don't they have other news? You'd have thought Pogba had said something like "That José is an absolute fxxxing txxt and next time I see him, I'm gonna knock him out."  That would be "Jaw dropping".
So Mourinho being bad at man management is “jaw dropping” is it? Well you are in for a treat, because I have another “jaw-dropping” bit of news..........Water.....................is wet.
If I have a penny for every time David Ornstein blinks, I would be a millionaire!
I couldn’t watch the end of the video, ornstein was literally blinking 100times a second it’s all I could focus on
All he said was the truth
Pogba was just saying what we all basically knew anyways
Tf that wasn’t that bad at all
Sky literally asked him the question 🤣🤦🏽‍♂️
As if it’s “jaw dropping” lmfao
Sky are turning into the sun newspaper show the full story and what he sed was not in the wrong making a mountain out of a mole hill. 😅
What people don't notice is that Pogba is fasting during this time he won't say bad about anyone he's protecting his fast to not say bad about anyone..
The smiles on those guys at the beginning of the video are hilarious,  They have that milking written all over their faces
Pogba needs to be sold; he isn't a fit for United at all...but these comments were hardly jaw-dropping.  Pogba speaks the truth here.
Who's David Ornstein 👀🤔 this is not news, Mourinho would fall out with himself any given day so don't know where they are going with this 🥱
There's nothing jaw dropping about this he was just being honest ,Fuk these xenophobic sky sports if Shaw said this they would've reacted differently
What a success Pogba got with Ole😁😁😁
What is "jaw dropping" about Pogba's comments? He said what is glarringly obvious to everyone. Sky, you dont have a story here.
good luck make people relationship more sour lol this is not only modern football, this is modern reporter
Ole did it to Lindard 🤷🏿‍♂️
sky trying roasting something that looks so delicious for them
Muhrinho is finished as a manager.
He made one comment now these psychopath bastards are going to make it into a story.
I don't think Mourinho has changed. The modern player's attitude & work ethic has changed. I think Mourinho likes players with a old-skool (no nonsense) mentality. He had a lot of players like that at Porto, Chelsea & Inter Milan hence the success. I think that players that lack fight & desire don't sit well with Mourinho. He not putting his arm around these players and I don't blame him. They are earning 200k+ per week and they can't track back and make a tackle??? Get Lost!!!
Jawdropping omg whose this fella eh,did he just come out of primary school and got a job work experience with the athletic
Pogba is a great talent, but is very immature. I think Jose grew frustrated with him
Surprised?Surprised about what?the dogs on the streets knew this
As a current Spurs fan, I’m not surprised at all by Pogba’s comments. We see the same thing happening now with Jose and some of the Spurs players
Jaw dropping 😭😭😭😭. Guys literally just telling the truth. Slow news day for sky sports. Get a grip
Dele Alli huh
Jaw Dropping. Hahaha have a day off
What was wrong with what he said?! I'm still waiting for someone to explain.. everyone knows that they had a falling out why does he need to act like they didn't?!
Pogba had become lazy and Mourinho probably pointed that out which he didn't like, and subsequently sidelined him (similar to the Delle Ali situation). Pogba has only recently started playing OK again (since his agents transfer fiasco). He isn't as good as he thinks he is. In Mourinho defence players are probably molly coddled too much nowadays and given to much power whereas when he started managing in football you could tell players off and they would take it onboard and improve. Today if you tell a player off they sulk, and if they are costing the clubs millions in cost/wages and sitting on the bench its just easier to get rid of the manager.
Jose protects himself, his reputation over players, the club, the team doctor, anyone. Ole by contrast puts the club first. The irony is that Jose damages his reputation and standing by putting himself first. He’s doing it again now, just in a more passive aggressive way. ‘I don’t want to go in that direction’, he says every week, which is of course going in precisely that direction. As at United some Spurs fans are letting him convince them that the players are no good. Spurs had far better summer window than United and arguably have 4th best squad behind city, Chelsea, Liverpool. Truth is that very few teams if any are good enough to defend a one goal lead.  We weren’t (at United) and still aren’t. Hence we at least try to go for another goal except in the last ten minutes or so. Poor Jose seems to have rapidly declining players following him around!
Yet pogba hasn't won a trophy since Jose. Interesting
We love Paul and hope he stays, stop milking it sky
Spoilt player
Waiting for Jose's presser. What he says about Paul.
Speaking truth - Dele Ali
I wish Pogba never did this. Everyone should leave Jose alone on his island of self pity and public negativity. I also feel that it's bad "football karma" to speak to much before your career is done.
Just had to be a man utd player to bring fire back to the premier league 😊🔥😊🔥😊🔥😊🔥😊
Jaw dropping? 😑
Who cares
So players can’t voice their opinion?
nothing bad about the interview just the truth
What pogba said was nothing jaw dropping maybe it’s the culture because I’m American we say crazier stuff than this
He's literally doing the same thing to Dele Ali right at this moment in time which is disgusting
I saw an interview that fabregas did with ferdinand and he said something similar about Mourinho
Seems like an advert for Harry Kane to me
Good for pogba 👏
That hooter is the most jaw dropping thing about this video.
What kind of idiot dont know that the Mourinho school is like that? Lampard is from that school and Mourinho was his teacher....  He has also the ability to sideline players for no other reason of his delusional self greatness and infalibility... Rudriger Azpi    Alonso etc.....
Obviously"The Special One"Powers He Possessed During Terry & Lampard's Era Are Gone🤷🏽‍♂️
I just knew sky will stretch it. They ask the question n when u answer they stretch it🙄🙄🙄
Sky sport making a madness out of this
Sky Sports once again twisting words. Sky Sports should concentrate on getting the champions league back instead of depending on Pogba for views.
Now I know why footballers just lie this will be on every platform and talking point for the next year!!!!!!
"Jaw dropping" Really Sky ??
Sky Sports gonna milk this for 2 months now ffs
ANYBODY surprised by this must've been living under a rock or denial, it's clear to see moronhio's a coward, always throws players under his parked bus, NEVER takes blame
Pogba felt like it was his duty to defend Ole especially because Ole struggles to defend himself !! ❤️
Now that you've got some concrete solid gossips to do sky 😂
These presenters must be shocked with extra chilli sauce on their food
ohh here we go the media have something spicy to munch on. Everyone knows what mourinho is this is not news dont make it a big deal.
Pogba is one of the most overrated players I've ever seen in the game ffs. He's deluded thinking he's not inconsistent. Also he's a total narcissist more worried about social media than applying himself 100 percent to the game.
Does this mean he staying with United beyond the summer
Hardly jaw dropping. Mourinho can make comments and blame players, but the players can’t answer back? Respect is earned, not demanded. Mourinho is an excellent coach but his personality and need for the spotlight gets in the way.
Where’s Roy Keane?
The players, the fans, and the English media need to understand that the manager is not hired to be the players' father or friend. The player's role in the club is to play football and the manager is the boss. These side-shows by English media to stir up the pot are disrespectful and do not paint Pogba well.   Remember they are all in the same industry and relationships whether old or current need to be respected. Man United might be doing well currently, but what happens when in the next season things go downhill? Especially with Pogba. Remember football is very unpredictable, they should learn from the past.
“JAW DROPPING”...
Is this really news? Pogba nailed it. Mourinho is all ego.
Kevin De Bruyne said the exact same thing about being iced out, he literally wrote it in the players Tribune. . Let's see if the media treats both comments similarly
I would rather care about what guys like Drogba Carvalho Ibrahimovic think of Mourinho than what a "modern player" like Pogba thinks of Mourinho.
Mourinho will be out the door if Tottenham don't finish high enough to qualify for next season's Europa League. Imo, though I think   Levy will sack him anyway even if Spurs do qualify for that competition, as the players have had enough.
Jose not hypocrite person. That’s why players like pogba don’t like home.
oh stop overhyping EVERYTHING!!!!
what is ole doing to Sergio Romero hen?
If my father mad, he will silent and like pogba i dont know what he is thinking, i really dont know. 20 years later, now i know why. Kids this day is Late Bloomer, thats what old generation told their friend, parent always the first not their kid. So kid back then need to learn, Now opposite.  I dont blame anyone. Its not like or dislike someone, My father generation, me and my kids have different situation and different way to handle the situation and relationship with other people.
Omg so jaw dropping 🤪
Win or lose, , Mourinho always made PL more entertaining, 😂😂
Jose must be doing his nut he's been at untied and spurs and in total had around 5 quality players but he's never seemed like a people person lol
One thing about Sky Sports they will take one interview and make a 100 videos
Pogba got the last laugh!
Because ole likes mediocrity and Jose doesn’t
as a life long Spurs fan but not a fan of Pogba I have to say the latter nailed Jose :(
My jaw literally fell off
Their gonna milk this
At the end, it just how the media works and make money. 🤷🏽‍♂️
The cult of mourinho out in full force in the comment section hahahaha accept the facts jose is done out here I remember when he rejoined Chelsea and the statements around was its not if he wins the champions league its when man is further from winning the champions league thens he ever been people need to accept fact this is his level now
Mark McAdam has no vocabulary 🤣🤣🤣
Why are they acting surprised? Like it a new thing
This is not surprising! Pogba lacks personality. Mou brought him to united but he started misbehaving!!! I am surprised he said he doesn't know what he did!!!! Everyone who knows football knew that!!!!
Heated jaw dropping comments from pogba. Why not get chunkz on to tactically analyse the situation. Fml
My jaw is literally hurting after it dropped so hard.
So to be clear, they’re tryna blame Pogba’s comments on Mourinhos next couple of results
Perfect interview just few hours before the game as well, unbelievable
These kind of witchhunts do no one any favours.Personall think this ''dirt digging'' should cease.Does not promote Sky Sports in a good light ....
Delle Ali smiling
What was so jaw dropping about what he said! British media trying to milk it. Pogba should just leave England for his sanity.
Oh no player is honest JAW DROPPING URRRRRRRRR RE
Jaw dropping?  He's easily shocked. Lol. Pogba spot on. The media helped create Mourinho's personality.  They should stop pretending to be confused by him. If he leaves Spurs theyll be grovelling at his feet again at his next unveiling.
I think mourinho just gets so annoyed coz his players are nothing like his old Chelsea inter Porto and real teams
*Surprised...?Quit cappn bro. Even a toddler saw that coming
Must be a slow sports news day for Sky 🙄
Good man Paul Jose is done out here he’s not a good manager anymore thinks he’s better then he is stay at Utd Paul I think we can win the prem next year with 1-2 more players
Rooney said the same about mourinho
tbf mourinho is great but his relationship with players is his biggest problem
I think Mourinho's IQ is way above anyone around him, and that frustrates him at times ... he has to control himself, or restrain himself from mocking all those less intelligent people around him.
Jaw Dropping?   This difference is apparent to EVERYONE. Pogba didn't even need to say it. Media is actually bollocks.
Pogba was just giving his opinion about one of his previous managers, players do it. How Ornstein perceives that to be 'jaw dropping' is beyond me. Jesus wept.
Pogba was being an arse though.
Mourinho tried everything to ruin Pogbas Career, and Pogba is just returning the favour....love it
It's getting more entertaining btween  spurs and man utd I'm enjoying it
Ole did that to lingard
Really jaw dropping?
“Jaw dropping” the UK’s embarrassing man
Media as usual  i personally  think he's not that bad its his agent and the media more so
This is why Mourinho tries to avoid answering questions, media make a mountain out of a mole hill.
He’s speaking facts stfu, leave Paul alone
Jaw Droppings??? How these guys blow things out of proportion. What modern players ?? Players always needed protections from you leaches.. And some managers understand that and some are like Jose. No players put Jose under the bus. He put players under the box office Jose Bus. " Into the Jose "
Keep milking it now u🤡🤡🤡
Jose thinks he can do whatever he wants and no one can speak against him, pogba just told the truth. Jose constantly critisises his players publicly. This is an embarrassing reaction.
Hardly jaw dropping is it 😂 well in Paul
Pogba should focus on playing soccer ,thats the thing about stupid players
Sky asked a question & Pogba answered it in a humble way, why they so shocked over his “jaw dropping comments” lol
He won way more with mourinho so...
Misleading title as always. Nothing Jaw-dropping about his comments. You should pull up clips of Jose's comments and get an idea of jaw-dropping.
"You put them on the side and they don't exist anymore" Donny: Am I a joke to you?
Stop talking shits just do what you gotta do
Truthful comments which everyone knew or could guess,it is just "jawdropping" This panel and others act surprised lol
The only thing that has changed over recent years are the caliber of players produced. Most of them that show signs of talent are bamboozled with too much money, feel they are bigger than the club they play for and expect to talk back at their managers. Chelsea class of 04 gave their all, blood, sweat and tears for that badge, just like most players back then. Now, it's all popularity contest, social media obsession and falling down at the slightest nudge for weak penalty calls. F###### Weak minded players.  Personally, Mou should just do only international gigs, at least there he would have free reign.
both are boring.............
Ole won 0 trophies 🏆✋
Pogba has said nothing wrong. There's such an agenda against him.
I could’ve sworn KdB said the same thing lol. Not exactly the same but definitely along the same lines.
Pogba just said the truth. Period
Mourinho is one trick pony ..then when doesn't work ..starts to blame the players ...the club ..the ref...the pitch ...the doctor...the weather....never him ...
Here we go again smh. Pogba should stop doing interviews.
look at what his done to deli ali
no lies detected
Pogba telling his experience nothing wrong with that
And the funny thing is, ever since Mourinho left, they're still in the same situation, trophyless. So for me, it's pointless whether they've got a good relationship with Ole. Winning matches and not winning any trophy is pointless 👍
Clickbait, Sky trying to use Pogba to keep this story running
Here we go again. Pogba performs well, media get him on for an interview, deliberately ask him a question about a spicy topic they want him to say something controversial about, then get surprised and slate him for commenting on the very thing they asked him to comment on. Nothing new
I thought Pogba's comments were mature, respectful and measured. The suggestion that they were "jaw-dropping" is ludicrous sensationalism.
At 3:35 why is ornstein blinking so much😭😭
Strong comments😂? You would have been that over sensitive guy in school.
This narrative that Ole is a great man manager is laughable. Is Pogba happy playing as a winger on the left? Or is he entering his last year of contract and wants to portray himself as a team player and that the problem was Jose? Where were Pogba's nice words about Ole when his agent said he wanted to leave beacuse he couldn't express himself at United on the eve of a decisive UCL game in Leipzig?  Is Van der Beek happy? Biggest signing of the summer and can't even start against a mid table spanish team like Granada. Ole threw Lukaku under the bus by playing him in the wing. Lingard couldn't get minutes and now he's flying for West Ham? Please...
I hope Everton beat Spurs and Jose gets asked about this after the game  😂😂
Unless you crashed onto this planet in a capsule recently, this shouldn't be anything jaw dropping
You know Mourinho is watching this in his office
And the funny thing is, ever since Mourinho left, they're still in the same situation, trophyless. So for me, it's pointless whether they've got a good relationship with Ole. Winning matches and not winning any trophy is pointless 👍
Can someone explain to me exactly which comments are "jaw dropping" or controversial?
How are these pundits surprised by what Pogba said? Pogba is an honest and confident person. It was well known he and Mourinho's relationship deteriorated. 1 plus 1 equals 2.
Pgba:Ole dosent abandon players Lingard,Telles and Van de Beek:Hold our unused boots!!!
Wooow so so JAW DROPPING woww😱😱😱🤡🤡🤡
Let's see how many trophies Ole wins. Also, this "modern Jose" has always been the same. Making it sound he failed at United when he won cups with a basic squad. Sensationalist journalists.
The notorious P.O.G 🐐
Jaw dropping? 😂😂😂😂
Ole dont play donny, Bailly and Tuanzebe and they all better than our starting lineup
Truth hurts
The comments were not "jaw dropping" it just confirmed everything we already knew about Mourinho.
He win 3 🏆with mourinio pogba is big rats
If football was horse racing, Mourinho would be the kind of rider that would kill his horse if it meant he could win a single race.
The world has moved ahead...mourinho's players pre Madrid belonged to a different era. They didn't complain... Nowadays players are superstars with fragile egos...
Whats the issue? Can anyone tell me if he said anythint wrong? Look at mourinhos behaivours since he came back. He is also a lover of drama
Sky sports produce this on the day of the spurs game same as last week saying Kane would leave teh day before the United game.Fuvk u sky sports your agenda against spurs is clear and your a bunch of bastards
He didn’t say anything bad. He just said how his relationship was😂.   Jaw dropping
His short term services in all clubs tells alot.
What do you expect the manager to do when your most expensive signing, and highest paid player and his agent show you and the club so much disrespect. You will find far more players who rate Jose than dispise him
Pogba❤️💯
😂 Nothing jaw dropping about it. god sake. Trying to make it sound worse than it actually is.
What’s ‘jaw dropping’ about this? Everyone knew they didn’t get along and Mourinho made it very evident. Let’s go PP6 💪🏼
jose was best pundit you ever had, ledgend
Parenting has changed fro using a belt on children to advising them. So too has couching. Don't go chastising these kids. They didn't grow up in your era. Even fouls have changed. Every manager must change their approach.
Tbh they’re proper babies now these footballers
Another red card is coming from Mourinho for Pogba 😁😁
David Ornstein, Arse
Great guy progba
I’m still picking my jaw up off the carpet after that, such is the level of jaw dropping-ness
Spurs players gotta get it together man. As a Chelsea fan I love Mourinho and hate to see him getting disrespected by the Thursday football Man Utd
At 23 lampard was already a man - mourinho
Where’s the full interview?
Mourinho did dirty on Casillas. From a legend disappear and not appreciated
If pogba is saying & feeling these things just think what the Tottenham players are thinking about him right know 😂
Just gave his opinion. Don't unnecessarily create a controversy. Everything is fine
I give everyone bread I steal too
Pogba and then he sees mourinho 🤣
You pundits are surprised? Really?
Mourinho about to clap back with something amazing I reckon
It’s funny how there always on his back when he was the one that was asked .
Well I’m not surprised
GOOD LUCK to SKY SPORTS for MILKING THIS  🍼🍼👍
Sky sports news is turning into a gossip channel
Pogba done nothing wrong he was interviewed and asked about his time on mourinho it’s not his fault he’s a very humble guy and he’s telling the truth.
“ JaW DrOpInG CoMMeNT “ bruh everyone knows the beef between Jose and pogba. This ain’t news   What’s jaw dropping is that mark noble has chance to play champion league football next season .
It's obvious Jose just picks one player and tries to treat them like shite. He tries to install fear into the team so Jose gets his way.
4 bums trying to make a career out of talking about pogba
In other words Jose is hot and cold and Ole is a yes man
Why is this so jawdropping people are getting way too sensitive nowadays
ORNSTEINNNNN.... ARSENAL CLUB LEGEND... FIRST OF HIS NAME...  BREAKER OF NEWS... KING OF THE ATHLETIC
Mourinho trashed Paul and turned me and a lot of United fans against him.. Jose probably deserved this.
If this fool thinks it's jaw dropping he needs to find a new hobby. Were it not for candid conversations we'd have very bland, predictable interviews.
I'm always with the coaches in situations like this especially in this case because i don't like Pogba as person and professional at all.
Jose doesn’t help himself tbh
Jose is a negative person
Interesting..............🌈🔥
how is this jaw dropping? they are trying to vilify him lol
Stop acting like u guys know Jose personally... U media journalist probably live a miserable life😂😂😂😂😂😂
Why is David constantly smiling😂😂😂
Ooooh jaw dropping
Everyone against Mourinho... Just like he wants it
Mourinho: I'm a better person than Ole and Pogba put together
Ornstein credibility got shat on last summer by AFCBell
He’s not wrong really is he
Imagine if this happened 20 years ago
Loool I knew this was coming fuckin hell you guys love jumping on the Pogba hate
Thought it had been too long since the last pogba circus, glad to see everyone's back at it
pogba goat
Pogba is snitching
Pogba is a petty and bitter person. He has tried to hide his lack of commitment and massive inconsistencies by putting it on Jose. What a sorry character!
More Jose bashing apparently his cleaning lady complained when left his sink full of dirty dishes lol
This makes football interesting most players and managers are boring AF in interviews...fair play to pogba
