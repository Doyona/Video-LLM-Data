Have you tried this?
honestly it looks better than it actually is. It IS better then the plain instant ramen, but still much much worse than an actual ramen.
Anyone get sick from eating egg that is not fully cooked? I would love to try this but eggs in the US are not safe
it's still garbage that you're poisoning yourself with
No 🤮🤮🤮
Can you taste the mayonnaise?
Looks very good! Gotta try this!
I would have used ranch instead of the mayo
I would strongly recommend using only the egg yolk- it's best for a recipe like this!
4 years later......  i might be a little late to this ..viral hack..  whoops.
Pro tip add some peanut butter and a dash of soy sauce in the broth base. Next level
I say the soup and pull a couple of boiled eggs in there and put them in the fridge overnight.It's so good.It's even better with soft boiled eggs
I think youre supposed to use just the egg yolk
You only need to use the egg yolk 😅 for the creamy ness
What about that egg smell
🤢
this is like years old at this point
Wondering if i could substitute the mayo for sour cream because I really really hate mayo...
I made it kinda does not  like the strong smell of mayonnaise
Same price as a Big Mac meal? A Big Mac alone probably, no way a Big Mac meal is 7 dollars in this economy.
This gave me mad diarrhea
Yummy 😋🤤 !!
adding a spoon of Miso really changes the experience
Can you taste the egg?
i have a fear of eating raw food so i’d still be paranoid
Seperate the egg white from the yolk for better consistency
Delicious. But that top comment needs to be done too! 🤤
This looks like the ramen that jungkook made on his live once and asked armys to try it too. He even posted the recipe on weverse...
Not bad.  Try some sesame oil and seeds, a couple pieces of dried seaweed, and slices of medium rare steak.  And even though you already mixed an egg there, add a soft boiled egg.
I like this but the smell of raw egg makes it unappetising
😂 ALWAYS Add an egg to raemen !!!!!!!!!!🎉
I would try it but without the mayo.
Nongshim is the best ramen for this.
i'd use crunchy peanut butter
😋
I love this hack, I personally can’t fully handle spice so it helps tone it down for me
I just tried this and the taste made me *ascend.*
Do not add water ! Carabonara 1839 just add the hot noodles.
Not sure what I did wrong but my mayo just curdled to the top
Substitute for kewpie mayo??
no kewpie then use mayo and mustard
I tried it’s so bad
Try with just the egg yolk instead of the whole egg it's actually better that way and then what I would do with the egg white is season it fry it and put it on top the broth is a lot richer
You’re suppose to use the yolk not the white.
japanese eat korean ramen is kindaaaa  weird.. what next..you eat their eel too.. go with nissin  korean hate you so much but you keep loving them.. what a weird relationship
who is watching this in 2025 👇
How can you eat  The raw 🥚 egg?
Just tried this, its so good
If you like it spicy you need another packet 😂 I prefer the egg thrown in while it’s cooking with all the stuff added already
Ita egg yolk
your meant to separate the egg yolk form the whites......
The problem with this hack is that the smell of the noodles was so eggy and it was kinda stinky so I want to find a way to eat without it smelling like that
This looks so nasty omg
Just put the egg sauce  in the boiling water, it gets cooked a bit but only a little. Makes it taste even better tbh
Don't like Shin Ramyun. I wonder how this would work with Neoguri Udon.
Nice way to add some protein and make it more filling, too. I think I might try this, I love these noodles :o
Narutos mode 4 variant smoke bomb is actually busted, if you press it again while in the smoke you do a gap closing command grab combo starter that goes through block and moves at mach jesus
I wish I could try Shin Ramen but I’m allergic to mushroom. Would be great if they had any option without mushroom.
shin are low key overrated
Just do an egg yolk next time it makes it more rich
Every ramen "hack" video ever in a nutshell -  Egg
wsg 8 kunners
Add cheese and sausages and it's perfect
your voice is so soothing i feel awake❤️
Instead of kewpie mayo I use Brie
Drop a brownie inside 😊
Salmonella
I don’t know why but ramen holds a special place in my heart, like I feel safe making eating and even thinking about ramen, it’s so warm safe and peaceful to eat ramen and watch yt shorts ❤😂
The girl at 23:04 has literally never watched anything else related to chapel roan except that 30 second video. Chappel is such a positive and happy person. That woman is lying bc she feels threatened and targeted .
JUST USE THE EGG YOKE THO REMOVE THE WHITES
Pro tip: Put the veggies packet in with the boiling water & noodles so the mushrooms aren't like little sticks in your ramen!
That egg is almost spoiled
It's really good, and it tastes pretty good without the mayo if anyone was wondering.
What was the 3rd ingredient put?
Does the egg and mayo make it taste like that because I don’t like either of them but if it mixes I’ll feel hetter
For anyone in the US doing this, I hope you used the right eggs
Where's the beef?
disghusting
If I still want it spicy will spicy mayo work just as well?
Remember a few months ago, when eggs were affordable enough to be used as protein in cheap foods like instant ramen in the U.S.?  Good times . . .
Thegoldenbalance
Add sour cream. That’s the hack! And a little bit of lime.
I tried this once. I think I prefer to just drop the egg into the pot while the noodles are still cooking about a minute before they're done.
its not a "hack". look at the damned package.
I'd like to add some sweetcorn, it dance along the flavours
Imagine using Chicken Broth instead of water and adding some sate chili paste
Great vid but I hate that she always sound stuffy or something stuck up her nose 🤦🏾‍♀️ it give me the ick
Minus the mayo and I’m down to try it.
looks good but i recommend chili oil instead of mayo
This is the only way I eat ramen anymore
The whole raw egg 😢
It's not a hack. It's a recipe ffs lol
It looks so good, I wish I could try it
it was just the yolk tho
But raw egg?
What was the white sauce?
Add boiled eggs and Serrano, thank me later 😊
I love that brand and the black pack as well. I feel they’re better.
supposed to be an egg yolk
So this is basically a cheap version of Shin Black.
No vegetables, seaweed or meat/seafood?  This is why 20 year olds are commonly getting colom cancer now.
Boil the water with the garlic. Add some soy sauce and sesame seed oil. Delicious.
Better instead of mayo use Kikkoman Wasabi Sauce (mayo)
Prison meals 😂
Instead of the Mayo that you put, I would love to try this with the Sriracha Mayo 🤤
im gonna do this rn with demae ramen chicken or sesame or maybe ill try both idk yet :D
I just tried this and its fire bro 🔥🔥🔥
Besttt
Egg is not cooked u can get sick
i used "Hảo Hảo" noodles instead of Shin ramen
Russians have been experimenting with noodles for a long time. Eggs, mayonnaise, sour cream, garlic, mustard, sausages, etc. are usually added.
I think that I’m very intimidated by most every ramen “hack” but this one looks like something I could actually do.
It seem good but I don't like the ramen used. As what I remember that one is too spicy. Too spicy for me to even taste the actual ramen.
Resting on ramyeon for 3 months for now
I tried it and my stomach hurts so much for like the past three days
Finally s.o. doesnt waste ramen with cheese
My husband has been doing this for me already for years 😂 the difference is he adds the Mayo and green onion on the cooked ramen (less water and cooked down) and a fried egg on top.
this is mie rebus
Can we use regular mayo with this because I don't have kewpie mayo at home
Have had maggi curry noodles shin ramen dnd maggi curry noidles taste the same but maggi is a lot cheaper
minus the raw egg for me that's fishy 🙈
Thanks for sharing ! ❤
Don't try this with american eggs unless you want salmonella
I am 3 year late
can we add normal mayonnaise instead of kewpie mayonnaise!?
It’s bomb
You only need the yolk not the whites
Aaaa soooooooo 10 out of 10
try it but instead of mayo use cream cheese
It’s the best with Jin ramen
I tried this taste way better doing it this way I will be using this method from now on
A little peanut butter, fish sauce, soy
What is the last ingredient? Mayonaisse?
This was really good! I'd take out the garlic, cause it was too much, and I love garlic.
This is exactly how I prepare shin ramen the only ingredient I don't add in is the mayo. I'm definitely trying this out next time I make it.
You forgot your soft boiled egg.                              Or is that too eggy for you?
Bad😢😢😢😅🤣
can i use reg mayo😭😭
This hack is pretty good, definitely helps with the spiciness. But it's very creamy and very filling. I couldn't finish lol
if i live in a place where raw eggs are dangerous to eat should i still make this
I love shin ramen 😍
It looks good but I HATE MAYO 😢😢
I have texture issues this is a little too much. 😣😨
✨️salmonella✨️
😊
Adding the hot water to the egg mixture is crucial. If you don’t do it slowly you’ll end up with chunky broth. It’s called Tempering the Eggs. It’s how you can make an eggy or creamy broth without scrambling the eggs accidentally.
600 kcal for a mediocre snack.. yay
Ah that's disgusting
Literally this came up while I was stirring my noodles into my kewpie mayo ramen 😂  Pro tip, add your favorite chili sauce when stirring, use fresh garlic chopped, and add way more green onion and mayo than you think you need.
Hack? I believe they call that cooking
Ramen is not supposed to be macaroni and cheese
Yum
I was to lazy
Yummy
Ughhhhh I need to go back to the store and get more shin ramyun 🫶🏻
im a little late to it as well 😂
Why the extra step in adding hot water to the bowl instead of just cooking it all together?  Does it make a difference?
Props to all of you who can jam in the whole spice package for just one bowl of ramen and survive 🔥🥲
Shin Ramen is spicy??? (addicted to samyang)
Bro ur doin it wrong it’s eat the ramen put two eggs in and warm it up three to four min
Gross
I made this with ichiban Sapporo ramen, regular mayo because I don’t have any kewpie and some gochujang paste for added spiciness and OMG. This is so good!! I need to try ramen recipes more often.
I tried this but i messed it up so im gonna have to try it again
They're not too spicy.
I did it the other day and it is amazing!!!
It’s been 2 years and I’ve STILL never heard of this hack
Calling Ramyun Ramen is a serious crime in south korea
I need a way to make Shin like 5x hotter but keep the same flavor profile
That looks good in Sweden. Fart means fast. No not like cutting the cheese.
Getting recommend 2 years later shows I should really try this
I was already doing these exact steps the other way around without knowing it's a hack.
Only yolk
I would not eat a raw egg
If you put put a little very hot oil over the package stuff and garlic & mayo so it boils a little and just throw away the water you have a sause in stead of a soup.
Oh my stomach bubbling
I tried this, took one bite, and then instantly gagged from the raw egg taste and threw the whole plate into the garbage bin.
Even better if you do just the egg yolk, the whites change it completely
Broth didn’t call the egg I would just eat it normally but it was more like mixed with egg
Stop saying creamy
Didn't I read somewhere that eating this much packaged ramen constantly plays hell with your digestive system -??
"For i know the plans i have for you declares the Lord, plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you  a hope and  a future"- Jeremiah 29:11
Tried this. Gave me the runs
This is the only way I’ve made my ramen for the past two years! Soooo yummy!
I'll leave the mayo out..
thank you for doing this late because this is the first time I"ve seen it. I have to say I tried something like this with an egg before but not quite in this order so I will definitely try
Those eggs are not cooked. I'm straight on that smh
ive just tried this hack…. didnt like it
This also works well with samyang spicy  noodles specially if you want it more soupy.
Yeah but the egg is raw tho....
I make this but only with yolk no egg white!
Shin ramen?? Tooo spicy??? Huh
I am doing that but with jin ramen mild and instead of one whole egg it's one egg yolk
Ewww no mayo please
What would you recommend as a sub for someone who doesn't like mayo?
only reason i wont try it cuz of the raw egg
I would suggest putting hot oil on the condiments and some more spice if that is what u prefer ... if u want fry some onions as well with the oil and yum
You just cut onions with scissors? 😂
Does it have to be kewpie mayo?
Tried it already, is overhyped
Just add slice of American cheese.. your welcome
I love all kinds of noodles but can't eat any of the instant packages as the sodium is so high as well as all the preservatives in the seasoning. I guess I could find recipes online and make my own seasoning as I love trying different flavours and spices.
why're you so good at making ramen😩
Is this ok to eat pregnant?
Your bowl is the exact replica of my wash basin 👽
I’m on cook at home🍜🍲🍛🍣🍱🍚🍙🍘🍤🍘🥟🍙 Hey🍚🥠🍥
WAIt WHY DO I SMELL RAMEN?!
the best part is both of their gremlin laughs
It's just the same and easier if you just cook the ramen with seasoning and once it's cooked then crack an egg and stir .
btw check if you can eat raw eggs in your country before
Is the garlic optional? Because I don't have that 😭😭😭
Why are u ruining the good spicy ramen with ur weird recipes
Did u cook the egg
haha i have been adding egg into noodle soup for ages.
I would do it but without the mayo mayo is disgusting if it’s Japanese or whatever
THE EGG JSNT COOKED
Instead of water can we try milk?
Mayonnaise? Ew
Add 1/2 can coconut milk + 1tsp curry powder to shin ramen. Just tried this week- amazing!
if youre trying this hack dont drip the water in a bit at a time, that gives it time to cool down as you pour each little bit through the air, pour it all in at once so you dont end up painting the bathroom
This is bussin just made it at 7:00 in rhe morning
Dose regular mayo work?
I made this today I loved eat extra points and chili oil
adding egg and a bit of mayo isnt anything new... I typically would just add the egg at the end
What mayo was it? I didn't get its name. Want to buy it
I make my (chicken) ramen pretty basic but its delicious. I microwave my noodles for 4 minutes but you can cook them on the stove. Then i pour out most of the water. I take a spoon full of butter and add it to the noodles. Then i add hot sauce a little lawrys, garlic salt, and the the chicken ramen pack. After its all mixed in i take a slice of cheese put it in the ramen the put it back in the microwave until melted.
Blow your nose
That's too much work!!!
I added hot pot meat to mine to level up!
Ich esse niemals ein rohes Ei. !!+
Tried with buldak red Worked really well Still has the spicy hit but did not stay too long
Shin ramens not spicy put Jamaican hot chilli sauce in there
how dyall eat raw eggs  😭
not hack, koreans do it for long time. it is just recipe.
Can’t you just put the mayo, egg and seasoning in the pot with the ramen and just cook, that’s what I do and it works fine.
This is originally from the channel thatdudecancook I think
The egg actually isn't cooked... there is no clumps of egg in there so it's literally just raw. so if you want to get a similar result add in the egg whites while the noodles are still in the boiling water on the stove then add the yolk in when you serve
you need try grimace shack
Why don’t you just drain the water and add the egg and cheese .. it’s thicker and creamier that way ..
i feel like i did this by accident before
so it is less spicy tasting, but does this make it equally less spicy/burning going through your intestines and out your bum?
I actually grew up with my ramen containing mayo! A small amount thickens the broth and makes it creamy. Most certainly a comfort food for me.
No thank you.
I think you are suppose to dispose the water because it has some preservation chemical on the noodle. You are suppose to use a new or separate boiled water
I don't think that is an original idea!  We did that with the egg and seasoning without mayo in High school 3 decades AGO!  😂😂
My dad has been adding egg in my ramen for years since I was little! He leaves the yolk runny so I can dip my toast!!
Might as well just call u the ramen girl atp❤
I wond to do it but I’m still a kid I’m 7 years old
Oh ok?
I do this every time I make ramen now. It makes it so much better. I add sriracha and my own seasonings as well
at the end, its like “putting in milk before cereal” 💀💀💀💀
I tried this last night from a different video. They used the egg yolk only and I didn't have regular Kewpie so I used the sriracha kewpie I had. It made it spicier and I loved it.
Smh 🤦🏼‍♀️
add creamy peanut butter to your instant ramen.. it makes it so beautifully creamy and flavorful
"Keep the water" > Like the packaging on instant ramen says. You wouldn't want to use your own broth + seasoning packet, it's one or the other. Even with reduced sodium that's almost-dangerous levels of sodium.  > "I was too lazy" You're making content. You shouldn't be lazy. Put a lid on the pot. It's not hard and it'll make things easier for you.
Do this for some Samyang 2x.  Enjoy the 2nd burn.
She just changed my life with those scissors on the green onions
I made this two days ago. If you dont like spicy dont get this ramen. My mouth and throat and ears felt like a pyroclastic flow was going down and out of them.
Will this work on a normal mayonnaise or we must have that one?
I'm not being mean in any way but are you ok you sound sick.
I have added eggs to Ramen for years!! Here is one to try that you will love!! Take a packet of Ramen and cook it but instead of the seasoning from the ramen add in a packet of cream of chicken soup!!! Your Welcome!
WTF IS THIS RECIPE DELETE IT NOW
Sqwooshy egg juices 😐
What could be a substitute for egg? I am a pure vegetarian, hence asking
Bruh how did she do this. Imagine eating instant ramen everyday bro eat too much msg💀
Salmonella be like 👀
pls make veg ramen
Its taste good but after that your tounge feel that egg yowk  whole day and thats not good
I tried it and it’s intresting Excepti cooked very thing in the microwave I had beef flavouring and I cooked the egg for 20 seconds in the microwave to be safe it’s tastes not bad?
This is dumb. Just add it to the water when cooking and keep stirring
i still don’t get how this is a “hack” isn’t a hack supposed to make things easy? this is actually more work, it’s a whole recipe
I can’t stand shin ramen it’s the only one I don’t like am I the only one? 😂😭😭 I tried to like it
❤❤❤
dam this ramen if f ing good
Idk were i went wrong just made it and i didn’t even eat it 😂 the egg smelt weird and it looked like vomit 🤢
Every ramen hack just has to include eggs doesn't it(I can't stand the texture of egg in the majority of cooking forms)
I've tried it alot of times but everytime it failed to match my expectations. It's better to add an omlette to shin ramyun than this shit
You messed up, you have to separate the egg yolk from the egg white and only add the yolk.
🤢🤮
I think I put to much water but it was still good thank you 😊
Omg sweet if this helps with the spice ill try it
Do you need the mayo?
I love your art it's really beautiful!!
Okay this may look good and taste good too but it smells like SHIT 😭💀
Ew ew ew
Me watching this at 2:10 am
What's about egg small
What are you guys keep calling recipes? A hacking something done to make something more simple. These are not...just recipes
_You did it_
Please don't try this ever l have tried it it tastes discussing
I'm not sure if you have tried this already, but you need to make doobys chili oil noodles!!!
This works with every broth.
Yum
My sister is the originator. I watched her do it all my life.
i love the spice of shin ramen.
These look yummy!
This is still my number one favorite ramen hack a year later. Thank you!! ❤
it's not spicy enough ,it has a sweeter towards taste ,okay for a 1 time experience
first person i seen do the ramen hack is ThatDudeCanCook
looks busting
lazy ah lazy dont eat lor haiyah use proper english girl
I do this all the time but I just use the egg yolk. I have ducks not chickens but I haven't noticed a difference as far as taste
Delicious and unhealthy, will make some when I'm lazy at home
I made this and it is my favorite recipe ever 😋
Mhmm salmonella
👏👍👌🍜.      🙏😇🥺:     xoreng
😍😘🥰.    😋💋
fbd
I can’t get the egg out of my mind 😷
Just tried this today and it’s so freaking good I will never make my ramen no other way at first I was a bit skeptical because I don’t like the taste of raw egg but I could barely taste it 10/10 would totally recommend 🤤
زفر
Dumb
plugged nose
Anyone else ever accidentally do this when they were younger..? Just me? 🙆‍♂️
I stopped watching after I saw scissors being used to cut the green onions 🤔🙄🤦🏻‍♂️
I do the same, but only add egg yolk. The sauce turns out more rich in flavor))
Approved
please be careful if you do this! I almost ingested raw egg by accident.
Just like Kylie Jenner Ramen but different way
The Waffle House has found it’s new host
It will mess with your stomach if u do not eat raw eggs 2 out of ten would not recommend
Egg yolk only, but the whole egg
Sounds like you have a stuffy nose
Basically carbonara ramen
For people having stomach issues after eating ramen: it's not only because of spices or MSG, but the preservatives used in it as well. And Shin Ramyun has Maltodextrin in it which causes inflammation in liver especially if you have sensitive stomach with GI issues. I have IBS, so I know this. But I used to enjoy Shin Ramyun before I got IBS.  Hope this helps to clear the confusion.
Nope.
I’m sorry but I tried this yesterday and honestly mine didn’t taste nice at all 😭😭😭 and d egg ugh i don’t even want to talk about how mine tasted 😩
I saw it first almost a year ago at „Aron and Claire“ but he used one more ingredient > Ketchup. Taste is amazing
Tried it and to be honest it wasn’t terrible but not as good as she described it
I tried this, and it tastes really good. I forgot the egg part but it turned out amazing anyway. Recommend 👌🏻
I just tried this with spicy mayo instead of kewpie. It was bombbbb
Naaa no for me
Not gonna lie, it looks gross af
The red shin ramyun noodles are spicy af I add milk to the broth when it's in the bowl it makes it much more bearable for me
I tried it and didn’t like it. I guess it’s cus it’s creamy. My taste fits the chili garlic one.
When you do this right it’s really solid. I made it for my mom and added too much soy sauce so it ended up super dark and salty but it was still pretty solid. Normally it’s creamy and light and perfect.
Shin Ramen is actually my favorite so you had my attention from the start, but great to know this isn’t specific to it
bet you have a monthly shin ramen subscription
My daughter also ads a slice of cheese 🧀
What does the egg do
Does this taste good with a basic pack of maruchan instead of whats shown?
Got a link to the original?
Thank you so much I've seen couple of videos and none of them explain what it is thank you you are life saver I love you take care beautiful
Highly recommended I did that when I heat the ramen Crack a egg and mix it unti its creamy yum kind of like hollandaise.
I just tried it. I added cheese and extra mayo and DANG it's good
I advise you not to eat instant noodles frequently but it is still your choice,I have not right to judge your life
Ewww....
Thx for the tip
rotten 😂
ITS KILEY JENNER
Raw egg?
Tastes like doo doo
Try yippee
nice i will try this
LOL highly requested viral Ramen hack my balls. Adding boiling water isn't enough for the egg it was uncooked. wasn't tasty at all, yucky & slimy. No need to thank the originator of this "hack". Gave me Salmonella infection (mucus & tonsil inflammation).
Just tried it, fire 🔥
I’m craving ramen so bad at 1 am and this is making me so hungry
What kind of mayo is that?
So I’ve been wanting to use this hack to try Shin Ramen for the first time, I know shin ramen is already pretty spicy, and tho I have a sensitive tummy I’m a noodle fanatic! Does the mayo and egg combo lower the spice level at all?
You can get samanella
im a year late
I don't think if Mayo sounds good with ramen
This is the only time my mouth started to slightly water on food on the internet
Looks delicious... might try it out with Indomie since it is the only noodle available around here
am i the only one who eat them dry?💀
Looks bland
if you don't want a soup version here is for you.   1) Put in the powder and sauce from the ramen packet, add a bit more mayo, minced garlic and an egg BUTTTT, only the yolk and no eggwhites.  OH! It tastes better if your put some chilli oil 2) Put some water from the boiling noodles 3) MIX IT 4) MIcrowave it for 15-25 seconds 5) Put your noodles in  AND BAAM, A CREAMY VERSION OF THE RECIPEEE!!! I have tried so many times to make this recipe AND I FINALLY DID ITT!!!!  Make sure to credit btw :D
Wrong. You should have cooked the dehydrated veggies with the noodles. Also, no egg whites.
What kind of mayo is that??? It was hard to hear what you said it sorry.
Do the gay ramen hack
this is literally just adding an egg and mayo to instant ramen... and this is "viral"?
I love "kitchen hacks" that are literally just recipes.
Tried this and immediately had to go to the bathroom. My stomach couldn’t handle it. As an Asian it surprised me.
45th day of asking for carbonara ramen with crab 🦀
I'm gonna add some kimchi powder-:0
The egg is raw
You should try ramen with peanut butter inside. It’s so good, I promise.
Try the hack I sent you I  promise it’s really good
This is the only way I'll eat these now omg so good
I tried this and my egg still scrambled in my bowl. Very sad and very upsetting. I couldn’t eat it bc of the texture 🥲
Shin Ramen and egg is such a bad combination it should be made illegal
Thank god for japan
Well the only thing I don’t like is the egg it’s like raw
Bro lives off ramen 💀
Ramen 🍜
Too much water.
AeUg
litterally just making it normally and adding an egg at the end would make the same thing.
will this work with any ramen flavor
Is it salty or sweet?
That Ramen brand is so good I wouldn't add anything to it.
Raw egg
I tried this without the mayo, but still tasted really good!
Do this again, BUT with burger cheese!! 😂👍🏻
The originator is me☠️☠️
Why does that look so..        Good
I'm a bit offish about it but i would do it by draining the noodle and reboiling some water. and dropping the eggin and then straining or combining there.
I tried this with he exact same ramen 😈 its amazing
You sound sick
That eggs fuckin raw dude....i mean if you like raw protein go for it
I don't eat it any other way anymore.
Why add egg if mayo has egg in it already
I would put the egg on the boil noodle with all the spices include chop Chili yummmy
So yummy 🤤 I do it with just the egg yolk x2 :)
Can we use normal mayo?
You lost me at egg
People haven’t always been doing this how is it a hack its just normal eating been doing this forever
Its raw?
just need the yolk😂
I tried this and I hated it soo much I couldn’t get to eat a second bite, my brother ate it
Should of put all that inside the pan and let it boil lol including the egg
I searched up "adding mayo to ramen" cuz i didnt know what to do with the mayo And oh boy it tastes toooo gooodd!!
Shin ramen spicy??? 😂😂😂😂😂😂 wait till you try Samyang 2x spicy
it's the same when you put the egg after cooking the ramen. Pinoy has been doing that for decades
Hmm.. gonna try this with indomie
A RAW EGG?
I always have weird slime in my egg antips rly hard for mixing
When i tried i put too much water
Instead of the hot water, add very hot oil with some chili powder.
Well, usually i just put the egg yolk, not the whole egg
RAW!!!
Try using milk instead of water. It's so good.
Y’all the water actually has wax in it. It’s not good for u.😬
Cool
That looks nasty
I always just put a egg in after thr Ramen is cooked because the hot water cooks the egg anyways
I would do a quarter of chicken bullion, sazon goya for color/taste, green onion and scrambled eggs fried in a pan with butter
Good to know the mayo helps the heat.. these are the exact ones I use and they take me so long to eat bc of the spice 😂
Ooo looks nice I should try it
Why does she always sound sick?
You're too late but I tried it it was so yummy
1 millionth like 😅
pp mayo? What
I can't eat noodles but watching u eat makes me crave it 😭
Wow. I want to try this
You guys eat raw egg😶💀?
Literally just made this and I'm eating it now, I had Bachelors Chicken Super Noodles. Go for something with a bit more colour as the yellow seasoning made the broth a not too appetising colour 😂 tasted amazing
What is a hack, recipes are not a hack…….
😋😋😋👍
Egg is uncooked
I just remembered I forgot to add eggs when I tried this hack some time ago after watching your video. 😂
Wait but then isn’t a raw egg
I don’t get how shin ramyun is spicy to people 😭
I think it’s Nick DiGiovanni but I don’t know
I tried this hack. And now it became a daily for me
That’s so disgusting. You’re basically making a mayo based ramen soup 🤮🤮🤮 Asians I’m sorry but wtf
I tried this and it was so salty since the kewpie is also salty. Never again.
I did it yesterday , and i loved it
Tried this with peanut butter instead of the egg, and omg, game changer!  I also drizzled a bit of chili oil at the end 🤤
I like noodles
I know this might sound weird but I did this egg and Mayo thing but instead of the ramen seasoning I did peanut butter, sesame oil,soy sauce, and chili powder and it was amazing
People find Shin Ramyun too spicy?
I’ve gastric problems 😢
Sawmanila? There’s a raw egg in there
Ok I see so your just tempering the “sauce” not make egg fluff. I always before draining the water and adding seasoning drizzle a scrambled egg over it causing egg fluff (fluffy scrambled bits), then drain whatever water I don’t want out. I don’t like a lot if broth. That looked and sounded really yummy.
Negative. More effective to add miso paste to the broth and put a soft boiled egg in with it after.
Да вы надоели быть "кореянками" корейцы не жрут такое 23/7 раз уж вы корейцы то приготовьте одну норм еду, у них рамен не состоит только из таких коробок.
I swear wasabi on sashimi, raw eggs with hot noodle/rice are divinely gold
I usually do the same but without the egg
Try salsa 😋
*first time?*
It's looking tasty but i think i wouldn't try it because of raw eggs🙂
Now add peanut butter
I just had those yesterday and they are spicy
Hell no
What kind of mayo?
Actually just tried this and it's so yummy
Too bad indomie doesnt taste good for this coz it makes the taste actually stronger (it's already strong for me).
The magic ingredient is Kewpie mayo 😉
I tried it like months ago and it’s delicious but my family was keep complaining that it wasn’t a good combination but it was delicious!!
Originator? Good luck. That’s uhhmmm. You’re gonna have to go decades back. Possibly centuries.
I did it is so good
"Viral ramen hack" Never have I heard of this or seen it but I will try it right now because it looks absolutely delicious
Looks good! But is it to salty?! I always find with these soups there is so much salt 😢
i have tryed this and its sooo good but it looks not good
Sis I think shin ramyun is not at all spicy like it's not at all woman......samayang is what is spicy
shin ramen is always the best! 😚😚💞
Ramen hack where it's just ramen but you add mayo and an egg. Ok.
I already try doing like this and I'm addicted ✨
Looks like shin red turned to shin black
Bro I’ve been adding seasoning packets into my egg for ever
Well everything is good but I can't accept uncooked egg
Her voice irritates me, it's like she has a cold
is the egg raw
I don't know why, I used to love shinramyun but now I don't like it's taste anymore
Its amazing, I've been doing this for years, will recommend
I have a question  Don't you guys have any problem with the stink that comes when we add the water in it
Or just add the egg while the noodles is boiling and add the sauce packet before adding the egg
I don't like that she's gonna eat raw egg soup 🍲!!!
I'm thinking about the eggy smell
Shin ramen isn't spicy, it's disgusting becauae it tastea like pure mushroom...
It looks like rose sauce
My stupid self read “I hate this viral ramen hack.”
Will do!!! 👍🏽
Waaa that's so good!
This is how I eat my ramen now! (For anyone who is iffy about "raw" egg, I use a very soft-boiled egg and mash it up in the bowl with the Mayo mixture - turns out basically the same! )
Good this i just bought some eggs and kewpie mayo and happen to loooove ramen 😍😂👍
You were supposed to give only egg yolk, but you gave the whole egg.
wait was what mayonaise?
Regular mayo?
LOOKS GOOD <3
Oh good. Another ramen hack video...that offers nothing new from the other 10,000 videos already on YouTube.
Pe pe mayoxD
Jesus loves you all
I tried this...it stinks of egg
That looks so amazing
Trying this when I get off work lol
YOU'RE late?! I've just heard of this!!
Looks like mushroom soup  Also can the mayo be replaced with sourcream? Idk if it’s called that but it’s śmietana in polish
you know raw eggs gives salmonella right?
As someone who dislikes mayo, putting it on noodles hurts me 😂 but W vid
Everything’s a hack these days
Yep and I’m trying this right now lol  Edit:It’s fine it was a little different than I expected but it’s still good I’ll give it a 7/10
I was in the middle of boiling my ramen when I saw this. Luckily, I had to put in the seasoning yet... This made my ramen taste 100% better. Thank you Lisa!!
You made me hungry
"It was creamy" Thats what she really said
Give this hack to our one and only V or kim Taehyung
Parfait
Both mayo and egg have properties that reduce the spiciness by quite abit. For those very spicy but tasty dry style korean noodles, I often mix the sauce packet with 1-2 eggs before throwing in very hot noodles before vigorously mixing. Gives it great texture and greatly reduces the heat without affecting flavour.
I’ll prob mess up and eat raw eggs and die
So basically ramen with aioli got it
Miss,with due respect  Don't hack please just eat it normally
Lol in Iraq and  Saudi Arabia we already do that always do that so yea it a old thing for us people now knows it
🤢🤮
OML SHE RHYMED . She literally said: "Taste wise, I'm honestly surprised". I was like.. HUH?!
I'm 14 easy to make and taste great I used regular mayo
Actually I dont like that 🤮
But that's raw egg...
Just turn my Ramen up a few notches..Office..
I do this with the Shin black Ramen, and I recommend putting your veggie packet in the water you’re boiling your noodles. It makes for a better sensory experience.
It looks so good
Sang nha minh
Ngu
Ga
Non
Me whos been doing this since childhood 😐😐
Yummyyyy!!!
Bruhh i could never have an raw egg!!!!!! 😭😌
I will try
Hmm.. salmonella ramen

Prerna.   Sharma.🇮🇳♥️🌹
You should try dragon noodles which is spicy ramen with ground pork, peanuts, and broccoli! It’s so good!
THIS- EGG- ISN'T- COOKED
I love this hack!  Usually when I blend the egg seasonkng mix with the noodle water I use one of those coffee milk frothers to get it super creamy and homogenized so good
All the voices in my head started talking at the same time while watching this
This was awesome. I used all the same ingredients. So good.
But the egg is uncooked??
Can we use normal instead ?
😍😍😍😍😘🤩
Yuck 🤮 that eggy smell
🤢🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮
Why is it called a hack?   Its called tempering an egg.  Not new.
I hate mayonaise so maybe a pass for me 😓
You sound like you have cough 😷  P.s. no offence, I like your videos 😷
I can't do with the raw egg smell
Salmonella tutorial
Nàaaaaaaaaaaaaasty and good recipe for diarrhea
Try indo time ramen with canned tomato soup with milk and a little butter! Under 80cents and amazing!  You can also add an egg for a larger meal
to anyone wondering if this is any good  i tried it out with normal mayo, it definitely upgraded the ramen, more creamy but do note i did not use shimyung ramen but its pretty similar
MAI
Butter instead of mayo, you're welcome
Alright so I just made it and let me tell you THIS IS AMAZING And if you don't have garlic just use garlic salt it still tastes great either way
Yegehbe
Uncooked egg
Ik how to make that and it tastes amazing!
Hungry
Me thinking egg is raw
five year olds: Omg! She’s making potions :0
My emetophobic mind said no thank you to the egg like that
Ramen ❤️
Hiii so I have question for you Lisa what is the difference between kewpie mayo and regular mayo?
Did you ever get sick eating this much ramen
Raw egg smell 🙄 🙄
Add sriracha
It's same😹👎
I just made this it is amazing  Thank you
Thats seriously gross
But it's increase your fat and starch
😍😍😍😍
Sorry to say this you are one of the most famous tiktokers that eat unhealthy foods.
Do you have a cold?
yup I'm definitely gonna try this next time!
I make this many time at home tho-  👁️👄👁️
I'm late 😂
You should of had it with steak and eggs
This ... is actually a pretty smart way to get more flavour and just keeping the cooking simple still
i tried this, albeit with my own small modifications. so good!! i’ll never make ramen another way again :)
You eat
After making this hack wait for two minutes and let the noodles absorb the broth this way you won't get flavourless noddles
Solid
肯定是一股臭蛋腥味
Love how all the white people in the comment cries about the raw egg lmao you guys never had carbonara?
Nice
I will have to try this.
I can hear your dying from the spice by the ramen based on ur voice
i mean yea.. but i usually just put the egg with the noodles haha
"I was too lazy." -story of my life
I refuse to believe that Sheldon never had stomach pain  for farting …  With how his family was ..
i just made this it is delicious!!!🍜
Idk the watery Broth looks a bit uhhhh uhhh yeah but hey who knows it might be good
I tried this and it sucked! The taste wasn't as great as when the spices are cooked. And that egg. 😖
Crumbl is Mormon owned
I got the exact same bowl :3
idk if it’s just me but her voice is so soothing
OHHH THAT'SS MY FAVOURITE RAMAN!WE EAT IT EVERY YEAR AT OUR BIRTHDAY OR ANY EVENT!
One day when I'm so bored and I'm so rich to afford wasting I'll fr try this 😂
I love preparing any reman like this
Lime juice, chili peppers or oil
Can we take a moment to appreciate how much effort he puts into his videos?
I am from India i dont understand why would anyone eat raw egg mixed with noodle broth.
i always add an egg and some cheese to my shin ramen
😨 this is what i always so-
Ur late to the trend and I'm not only 10 months late but a year late to this trend-
I did it....Best ramen I have ever made !
Too much work. Just throw a slice of American cheese in it and you’ll get the same result.
I'm late to your late video! Oh dear...
Have you tried this?
Please post content other than ramen. You’re over exhausting it and it’s over exhausting me with you popping up on my page
What raw egg 🥚
I LOVE YOUR VOICE
Yum😋😋
One of my favourite types!!
SHIN IS THE BEST RAMEN
Yes 🤤🤤
Shin Ramyun always makes my belly hurt although I love it!!!
*proceeds to raid my mom's shop in search of spicy noodles*
And still get the eggy smell
This looks gross but if its what you like
I only ate cooked noodles seasonIngs were spicy 🙅🏻 too hot, i cried
I did this and is a 10/9.5
I think you have a cold alot
Why I always have stomach pain after eating nongshim ramen
So u eat the egg raw
Wouldn't it be too eggy?
Gross
Surely if u wanna have diarrhoea
Yall ever just have mayo with a cup o noodle? Fire
NGL this tastes reaaaaal good
Superb hack
yuk yuk 🤮 row egg
haven't heard of this hack but been using egg to thicken my ramen broth for a while now. i like to use about half the water so it's more like a creamy sauce.
Could this work if one is allergic to eggs?
Hi 😁❤️❤️🦋💖💕💗❤️‍🔥💞😘💞💘
It’s like a ramen carbonara
This was really good. Thank you.
Oky ngl I tried this before and hated it, raw egg is not my thing
Everyone talking about their bad stomach after eating this  Like man Don't you have a brain there is literally a raw egg in this
That's a salmonella breeding ground
Try making it without mayo pls bc I do not have any kewie
I search vegan instant noodles hack and this got recommended, also the first thing was eggs..
No thank you, I prefer my egg to be egg and not juice. Glad you enjoyed it!!
It was creamy
my fav is: shin ramyun, mozarella one piece (for americans: fresh moist mozarella), chicken wiener (cut into small pieces) and cheese tortellini. dont ask me y, i just love it lol
I have actually tried this and it is so good! My whole family loved it
I don't know but i think  it good cuz I am not try it
Still scared of salmonella
Don’t think vigorous was the right word
I had it but I unfortunately threw up from it cuz I ate candy before I ate it D:
Shin Ramen isn't too spicy. It's too dang salty
That egg is raw. Where I'm from you'll have salmonella if you eat that
I'd done this without the mayo. Adding. Egg to Ramen is a great idea.
I m just not swallowing the fact that the egg will be uncooked 😐
I guarantee I’m earlier than everyone else here🤚
"I'm addicted to ramen" helppp
It's not A HACK
To all Crypto Investor: Axie Infinity(Defi Game) is gonna pump in the next few months because of their upcoming update.Invest now. God Bless us all investors×
People need to try this it’s how they made ramyun in the northern part of Korea when I was stationed there; add a slice of American cheese and chopped hot dog to it; has to be high quality ramyun like shin ramen and the cheapest American cheese you can find
I tried this. It made me have diarrhea
I can’t handle spicy food if I eat some Doritos I taste that spice I have a bad reaction to spice 😭😭😭😭
Y’all lovveeeeeee them eggs and ramen
Technical Term: Plop🤣🤣🤣 My family has been chefs for years!
🍽💯😮
Bro, only eating ramen wtf
Can you use normal mayo?
Raw egg Grose
Try Sunfeast Yippie noodle
I love this recipe it’s delicious
Girl this ain’t no hack this is a jailhouse prison recipe called a spread next time use 2 hard boiled eggs 🥚
coconut milk
This is really good! is kind of like sweet and salty, I made this for my mom who was really craving ramen and she loved it!
Just tried an inspired hack cause of this and they are amazing … I used , egg , ginger garlic paste , soy sauce , birds eye chilli sauce and a tea spoon of instant veg soup for thickness
I tried its bussing
Nah, I'm good 🤢
This made me hungry I am going to make myself some ramen
I have been wanting to try this for the longest time but I’m worried that I won’t like it since I don’t really like eggs. Your opinions everybody?? Should I try it?
Loved this.... already subscribed to ur channel 👍👍
I usually enjoy adding the egg at the end after microwaving my ramen, but this is also a good take on it I think
It’s so late and I’m craving ramen 🍜
Minus the egg and mayo I add a half a can of cambells cream of chicken or cream of mushroom soup and it's  so creamy and amazing.
Can normal mayo work or does that specific type of mayo only works
Salmonella 😍
This isn't a damn hack
I thought she said *The shyt Ramen noodles* I was bout to say, 😅😭🤣
It looks good but dos it feast good
Doesn’t look as good as what you usually do
It quite salty
None of that was cooked except for the noodles, specially the egg 😒
POV: you’re waiting for that one person to say who created this hack
I like my eggs cooked thanks 😊
isn’t that technically raw egg 🌚
What does the egg do? Lol
I don’t understand the kewpie Mayo hype. It’s literally just Mayo made with only the yolk of the egg. Tastes no different.
That pack of ramen on its own is absolutely disgusting it doesn’t taste like the maruchan noodles it just tastes gross but spicy not good but maybe if it had other things in it idk I’m still not sold on it
This is how I always do my ramen 💀 people don’t do this?
Can you use regular mayo instead?
I tried putting Raw egg in broth while cooking but after I ate it , it had a very pungent taste and tasted very weird and I had to throw the whole thing away cause it tasted so bad so if u don't like pungent taste and smell it's not for u
try adding the egg after the cooking process as the topper, and mix it in, add scallions if you do like it. the egg numbs out the spice a bit and its a good number if you dont like spice
Using the good stuff Shin. 👌
What u mean you late for it lmao
Can I use just any mayo or does it have to be that mayo?
Can't eat a raw egg, sorry
That looks so good! Where can you even buy ramen packs like this from? I’ve only seen super noodles
actually making some noodles and I like vegetable noodles
raw egg?
Imagine the smell 🤢
Using raw egg.. OMG  no thanks
“Set off the spice..” LISA I TRUSTED YOU… (still died from the spice) 💀
Im going to try this for my kids. They love spicy noodles but because of the spice, can't finish it all. Thanks for sharing!❤
Don't add the white part of the egg
bruh u been late for like 20yrs
I saw someone put vanilla ice cream in Ramen, you should try it!
Raw eggg
I've been putting mayo in my spicy ramen for years '_' It's a TikTok hack now?
Why the mayo?????
can we put cheese instead of mayo????
This makes me get the horrible raw egg taste in my mouth.
That’s my favorite Korean ramen.  👌
Creamy?
did this, ended up hanging out with 2 of my friends for hours, my dear toilet and cramps.
It is quite interesting that many people think shin ramen is too spicy🤣🤣  In the country where Shin Ramyun is made, that is common, and many people eat it with more chili
Isnt the egg still uncooked tho?
Have you tried salmonella.
Can you try this ranen recipe my old sister made? 1. Get ramen 2. Make milk 3. melt cheeshe and mix the ramen together and 4. Eat it btw the ramen is called cheesy ramen and its alittle bit spicy but it's yummy
THE EGG THE EGG THE RAW EGG THE EGGGG
Now there is a ice cream in ramen now.
I'ma try this with mama noodles
To anyone who's tried putting a raw egg in the bottom of ramen, how does it taste? Usually I stir mine in around the top; I used to try frying my egg, but the broth is so hot that it scrambles the egg. I like my egg a little runny so cracking it on top is a fave, but I'm curious as to how this differs
Is this safe to eat? How are you supposed to know that he egg is cooked, I'm worried about eating raw egg 😅😂
What brand ramen did you use?
คุณคือมันน่ากินมากเลยอ่ะน่ากิน
this is an insult to both korean ramyun and japanese ramen
Never use the leftover water from the noodle stew, that's not healthy tho
No
Great hack would recommend 👌
“Mayonnaise is spicy”  But seriously, this is one of my favorite ramens brands.
That's almost same technique as a cooking carbonara. You mix egg with cheese (pecorino or parmesan) and then put mixture into pan with spaghetti and guancale(meat for carbonara) and add some spaghetti water to mix mixture and spaghetti.
Dude that egg is raw
You can also mix the seasoning with peanut butter. It taste sooooo goood too.
Tpo much sodium
I tried doing this and failed miserably 😂 it tasted horrible!
Is your nose always blocked?
Damn, I didn't know that noodles could be HACKED 😎 I bet they're going 360 noscope fueled on a shrexy amount of mountain jew eh I mean dew 😎😎💥💥 Where can I download those dank hacks? Are they also available for Black Ops 3?
Disgusting
i’ve just done it and even tho i didn’t add all the spice packet cos i was too scared it was still sooooo spicy! if i ignored the spice it was quite good
This has nothing to do with this ramen but i got ramen today and decided to try it out and it was pretty spicy BUT HOW CAN U STAND THE SMELL it smelt so spicy and yet so bad but tasted so good so i just let my sister have it. So how do u stand the smell?
with eggs 🤢 .. I've tried it before
This is good, but there's far better things you can do with your ramen
Add hot oil
maybe i can get creative with some of these i do tend to pick up alot of ramen and soon i am going to start getting ramen once a month of ramens from around the world with this website that will send you a box of different types of ramen from different countries it’s similar to this snack box thing we used to get with snacks from around the world
🤮 good luck with sarmonela
I use cream of chicken/mushroom instead of mayo
I stopped at mayonnaise 🤢🤢🤢🤮
The definition of putting milk first then the cereal asian edition
Not good, just tried it lol
I tried this hack and I swear I got samanela
It's looking good
Sounds like she has a cold
This is so good, I tried it but with a different ramen packet. Its definently still a bit spicy, and I hope that the egg cooked, which it might not of for me. But its still pretty good
Add a slice of American cheese at the end and it would be amazing
Me who cant find Shin Ramen in my country:🥲
Why do u sound like u have a cold
POV ur musilm  👇  👇  👇
Raw egg I don’t know about that
Try adding only the egg yolk. It makes it creamier
What can i use instead of kewpie mayo
That's Ramen plus 1 egg 🙂 is IT THAT New?
The thing is that mayo doesn't belong in Ramen mainly because Ramen is a noodle with miso broth or chicken broth and my spice lovers there is Chilli oil so ya don't do it If you like good Ramen ps you can put any egg in to 🍜 and NO CHEESE
That’s looks incredibly delicious  Definitely trying
I love how much something that comes out a *cloaca* enhances ramen.  Nature truly is beautiful
Is it still spicy tho?
I tried it with samyang and the mayo curdeled
RAW egg?
Not really a hack... its just adding a egg
🤢🤮🤢🤢
This hack is originally made by doobydobap
For a pretty good & simple mix meal for Ramen I add tuna or shrimp & taco bell sauce, not the hot sauces I use the bottled sauces
I need to try this looks so good.
Raw egg 🫠
กพภ
I gotSalmonella and I completely honestly felt the whole thing and I got some mail it because you put more game and then I followed everything and now I’m in the hospital
How can you eat raw egg
You made it go viral
Hello everyone, just a friendly reminder that Jesus loves you and died for you.
I’ve literally been doing this for as long as I can remember…
I’m late too I’m going try this tonight

That’s one way
Is it normal mayo?
You vietnamese?

Hi my name is angilina ! i am a text bot i will reply to any comment on and i learn from you guys speaking to me !
Technically it's not just don't want to create more dishes than what you have I understand that I don't like creating a lot of dishes when I make ramen or lunch he's trying to keep up with dishes it's kind of hard
I add lots of stuff to noodles 🍜 💜💜💜
Her voice is so annoying 😂
just made it, and it was awesome!! i didn’t have any fancy ramen so i just used the cheap Maruchan chicken flavored, and it was sooo good. chef’s kiss ❤️
Use cream cheese and sour cream
Raw egg 🥲
Looks busing tho
I did not have mayo when I made it but it still made the ramen taste so much better!
i did not know this was a thing in 2022
Salmonella?
Try putting American cheese
Have you tried samyang noodles
Try finger limes! Love ❤
Looked this video up so I COULD try this hack! I hope it’s good!
“Viral Ramen hack” Meanwhile, half of the viewers getting salmonella
Who who are indians are you indian so like the comment  and  say yes jai hind
Can't go wrong with ramen!Ramen! We put butter garlic powder, onion,and Sriracha too! It's awesome.
if y'all want to try this, don't forget to use salmonella free eggs! it looks pretty good but i don't have salmonella free eggs at home so-
I love Ramen but the way my blood pressure is set up 😫. This looks like homemade broth!
Anyone who think mayo in ramen is gross. Mayo is composed of eggs, olive oil, with emulsified vinegar and peppercorns. It's a very simple sauce.
So ramen in basicaly soup?
"sHiNrAmYuN tOo sPiCy!!!!!" L BOZO
Started doing this earlier this year and I can’t go back to normal ramen!
Spread the gospel god loves you so as jesus love you all and goodnight and I I I have a great day today and I pray that you Spread the word of God amen to that God bless you and repent for your sins and prayers for Ukraine and don't let temptation ever overcome you be strong against temptation guys love you all and goodnight and repent asap 💖 😘.. .........

Me **hungry** **Tries it** 😦 IT TASTES SO GOODDD
QUIT COOKING 🤮🤮🤮
Ramen carbonara
Nasty
I hate Mayo
Ramen n siracha sauce, I cnt get enough of it
Not trying to take away from your video because this looks bomb but i found out how to make ramen a creamy texture without dairy.
Looks nice 👌 what flavour noodles is that?
Today I'm...
Joe Bastianich : Does it have raw eggs in it? You : 👀
You really love the shin ramen
u eat the wax and the free bacteria?
“ I’m late to this viral ramen trend” Where are you getting viral ramen trends?! I need ramen videos
My friends laughed at me when I showed them that I tried it
Hueekk mentah🤮
I was the one who made this up !! *say thank you to me Lisa Nguyen*!|
Doesn’t egg make your ramen taste plain?
Worst way to make this
YOO, YOU NEED TRY TO FRIED IT, in my place, do whatever u do in the vid except mix the egg w the noodle water, and just mix the egg with the noodle+seasoning, and then fried it, voila u got urself a pizza noodle...
Hax
Jesus loves you and God bless
i have tried this, and i love it!
I really wanted to like it but it tasted weirdly sour for me
Salmonella in 3.2.1
Nice
Known this technique since 2008. And been doing this and will be doing this forever.
If i try this ramen. I promise I never eat ramen again ....
no.
Why add mayo to everything? I get that it adds a creaminess but adding mayo and especially the ramen water is not healthy. The water has waxy residue from the ramen unless its handmade noodles.
This is really bad
U ate the raw egg.... 🥴🥴🤮
Raw egg?
Issnt the egg raw still ?
trash can city love. add what you want to that egg. nothing you add to taste will be be bad.
Do all this then put the whole thing in the frying pan for 2 minutes. Youll thank me later
Can’t believe the number of wussies so afraid of undercooked egg.  Live dangerously, it’s called creamy deliciousness…
would you get salmonella from this?
First of all I hate raw eggs so it’s not possible for me to try this, I prefer my eggs boiled or fried not still dancing
I like it 😋😋😋
I dont mix the egg up until i pour it in because i usually like it to have this corn soup like texture  With the egg whites all over the soup
Make:DynamideNoodles that tasty noodles
Ramen instant noodles is like Maggi in other countries
Everyone cant eat raw egg
This is really tasty! I tried replacing the mayo with peanut butter, and I think it tastes really good
Just add mayo will be the same)
I did a very basic version of this (used garlic powder and yum yum sauce as mayo substitute) and it was delicious.
Why always at 5 am do I see this wtd
yes. salmonella on the road.
You can do this all in the pot. Just add the mayo (i like to add gochujang as well for extra spice) and the egg is 1:30 before the noodles finish cooking, add the egg directly into the center and lid for 30 sec then stir vigorously
Drain the water a few times to get rid of some the oil the noodles were cooked in.. its very unhealthy.. use clean boiled water at the end
I will try
For a vegan version use vegan sour cheese as opposed to the egg.
804k likes for this lol we are doomed
You do realize a hack is making something easier, right? Adding more steps isn’t a hack.
Does it taste “eggy” ?
Can I try to use normal mayo?
Too lazy? Girl, ur boiling a pack of 2 dollar ramen
Ramen increases risk for metabolic syndrome in women. ...  Ramen can lead to weight gain. ...  Ramen can damage your liver. ...  Ramen can increase your risk of heart failure. ...  Ramen stresses your digestive tract.
I'm sorry about being your father or anything to the woman or woman would love a better thing in it when someone asks what happened before and that would. So the only person can see your job if it's been used before a little? Not even an example where she will never want me for an interview about something but I'm glad my friend who didn't feel about a little relationship would come on again for his first life because she's an older guy or I will try the new thing at home when the dog says they aren't doing what they're getting back together on my birthday so much more or than it gets the job that I'm just so sick when you need an abortion
So it's like a carbonara but with Ramen
sometimes i add mayonnaise to my dry instant noodle 😅😂 And i know some people likes to add mayo to their soup 😆
I've been doing this my whole life. Except egg goes in the boiling water and I don't use mayo
In what world does that egg look cooked😂
How can u eat uncooked egg 😖
what type of bowl is that? like the texture
I wish diabetes never existed, I would have ramen every day with some rice cakes and seafood. 🤤🤤🤤
Does this make the shin black less spicy? What can I do not involving lemon?
Salmonella:hi
can i use regular mayo?
If you eat a pork that's not from the shoulder you'll get uncontrollable diarriah from raw egg. 😂
I got the same bowl! Woah
You doing it wrong!! Add egg yolk only.
Don't eat too much instant noodles as they may increase the risk of heart disease and stroke
Kind of reminds me of those quick Samyang mega spicy noodle recipes where you can add peanut butter (plus maybe some sesame paste/tahini and sesame oil) to help get a flavour that's less creamy and less spicy (sort of Satay-ish)
Why does everything have to be called a hack?
It’s better if you exclude the egg white
I tried this like a week ago. It was delicious and easy! I think the original video (don’t remember the source) only used the egg yolk. Personal edit: I didn’t have kewpie Mayo and couldn’t find it at the store, so I found a substitute recipe of Mayo, sugar, and apple cider vinegar. Highly recommend!
Lisa the queen of being late to food trends 😌👑
It’s a good hack but I suggest to just use clean hot water instead. The water from the noodles may contain a lot of unhealthy oils as dried package ramen could have been fried, then dried.
I have actually been eating these noodles this way at least 4 times a week for a couple weeks now since I first saw this hack…best decision of my life to try it out lol
Adding egg and Mayo added to instant noodles has been a thing here in Japan for years. So that’s where it started. The west just caught on.
No thanks
🤢🤢🤢
It's semi raw egg soupy noodles🤮
What can i use instead of mayo? Maybe some miso paste?
YAAAA
Let’s think about it let’s not use the noodle water instead let’s use boiling water from a kettle because the kettle water is much cleaner than the noodle water
But dude it's raw egg
But that's raw egg.
How do yall like this kinda foods💀
This is the sort of things i need for college to beef up my ramen game
Cheese
It was really good…….but……you don’t wanna know….what…..mine looked like….idk what I did wrong…..??😭   It looks like diarrhea…
can't I skip mayo ?
Oh yeah what abt that raw egg?
For some reason I thought the hot water would scramble the egg 💀
Will you plz try (mayonnaise)(mustard)and (tuna) has to be chicken flavor ramen or which ever is you favorite ramen I recommend chicken flavor!!!!! PLZ TRY IT ITS REALLY GOOD
bro my entire life ive been making noodles wrong i have been putting it in a bowl and filling it up with hot water 💀
I don't know how they eat raw egg like I feel so disgusted while eating ( no hate just my comment) btw love ur recipes nd hacks 🤗❤... Carry on to guiding us more☺.. GOOD LUCK EVERYWHERE ND IN EVERYTHING☘♥
Chiiiii 🤮🤮🤮
I want to try it but how spicy is it?
It looks weird
I tried it, it looked gross. Imma stick to s normal boiled egg
I don’t get why people are using this audio for no reason 💀
Literally took 7 minutes and was so delicious I recommend this
been eating ramen and egg since birth 😒
Instructions unclear, i lost a future child now.
This is raw egg😕
Well um.... "hack"?
Okay so I just tried it and I used beef ramen-    It was not good. I may have added to I much garlic idk
Me : she will boil the egg  Me after watching: she ate raw egg 😭
Looks damn goodddddd
me; can't eat raw egg
For people who have tried it,  is it delicious?
Would regular mayo still have a similar taste?
Wait...what kind of mayo did u say
Egg is raw
People : i try my fav Le Me : wait what did a raw egg🐣
I just made it and man is it good
I really love your voice ♥️
Will definitely try
You added freakin raw egg bro
looks like my clogged toilet
i have a question can you try this with maggi
I lost the daredevil challenge in brawl stars😭😭😭😭
Ramen+eggs=🧦
The noodles  are already cooked U eat it without boiling it with the packet seasoning
To protect my stomach from raw egg , I think it's better to mix it in the water when boiling...
It look like indomie
I tried this with indomie noodles, and  it was delicious.
You’re guaranteed salmonella if you try this in a third world country
Have made this and it is good
Here's my recommendation for making the sauce and the noodles  1. Do not use the water that was used to boil noodles cuz all the starches, ect. Are dissolved in the water and you basically making your sauce dirty literally  2. Boil separate water to cook the egg 3.season water with salt before putting the noodles in the pot
i cooked it today without using mayo and it still tasted gooooood
Bruh it’s just raw egg
I tried this, but I was so scared about salmonella and could barely enjoy it because of that 😒
i don’t think it cooked the egg much but to me it’s not that big of a deal even in america because i grew up with people putting raw eggs in milkshakes
I thought this was the hot oil instant noodles. Never heard of this one.
I think you should cook the egg
Terima chor ni
Gonna try this, looks yummy 👍🏽
Does it work with Maggie?
this hack was invented by every Japanese person. Just credit Japan.
When you are Indian: "laughing in Maggie"
just watching this makes me feel jealous how people can eat instant ramen without having horrible stomach aches after
I know who did this it was dimsimlim
Making food is called a recipe, oh add ingredients to more ingredients for the awesome hack...stfu
I genuinely cannot fathom how people find shin ramen spicy
Im just eating chicken ramen rn
❤️
I love ramen 🍜
she is litreally eating raw egg :laugh:
Idk if you use the rest of the ramen but it seems like a lot of work for such a little amount of ramen
I’m DEFINITELY trying this!!!
Noodles are way too overcooked. Bleh...
can it be any kind of mayo?
:]]
What's the difference between regular mayo and the one in the video? can you use regular mayo?
Can't convince myself to eat raw egg
Looks like you put ramen in tomato soup
The whole time I been doing it wrong my brain was in the other wrong side-😭😭
I will stay late for this.
Do you really have to add garlic ?
Sounds like it wasn’t good lol
😋
I’ve tried the shin noodles
Ok but like I can never eat raw eggs
I actually was quite hesitant but thus us soooo good
Stop animal cruelty
Let me question something do you know where you will go after you die? If not let me say you can have a choice to either go to hell or heaven see 2000 years ago there was this man named Jesus who died on the cross for our sins and rose alive 3 days later all because he truly loved us he died for us so I question you now do you truly believe in Jesus or do you live for the world turn to Jesus Christ trust in him Christ has way much more to give than the world he loves us turn to Christ
Eh, tried it.  Maybe I’m doing too much water but it didn’t really add anything for me.  I think I’ll stick to poaching my eggs in at the tail end of cooking ramen
i grantee you those eggs are not cooked.
Mayo?🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮
I was doing this before the whites called it a “hack”.
I’ve seen your video before, and just now got around to trying this ramen hack. This is the only way I will eat instant ramen packs from now on 🤤🤤🤤
I just made it! I made it wrong by pouring the seasoning and stuff directly to the ramen + water and the egg whites cooked and it doesn’t look very good but it tastes so frickin good still lol  Edit: Do it with just the yolk!
How was it???
Sorry but It’s not a hack in my country
Broo the egg is raw 🤮🤢🤮🤢🤮🤢
Eww
Lol i ever ate this kind of noodle when i was in midschool. So good! But not recommended because raw egg may contain Salmonella
Shin ramen noodles are too spicy?! More like they are too weak, and should stick to eating bran flakes in skim milk
OMG I'M FAT
Question for anyone who can answer.   Do all noodles in a package taste like the cup of noodles type noodles? Does that make sense?  I want to try other ramen but I hate the flavor and texture of the noodles were all used to. The ramen yellow package. And red for beef..  If you have any suggestions for which type of ramen I could try and may like, please lmk.   I’m sure you’ve had lots of different brands by now. 🍜
🤮🤮
The egg is raw... other than that. Delicious.
Chat arguing Oooooooo- well we’re arguing- were-
Raw egg?
What would happen if she only added a little bit of hot water and added the noodles in? Would it be like a dry noodle?
Yummy 😋
I love those Noddles 😋☺😋😍😍
I made this just now and I taste absolutely amazing I recommend this
Now i know what im doing tomorrow morning
Is the egg raw?
Looking forward to trying it ‼️
🇻🇳🇻🇳?.
How do people enjoy raw egg?? I don't understand😩😭
Now im hungry. Thank you.
But......it's a raw egg right ?
That looks real good
Definitely trying this
My dad always makes this ramen hack when we're eating instant ramen it tastes so good🤤👍 buttt minus garlic cus my brother hates garlic
Your videos make me hungry LOL 😅. I still love your videos💖💖💖
I’m still shocked Lisa didn’t slap some meat and an egg on there
Yuck raww eggg
Never herd pf the hack but ima do it rn
meanwhile after eating 3 bites of shin ramen i cracked and egg and stir some mayo in it
I trued this minus the mayo and it was delightful 😊
I'd have tried this one but the egg's not cooked 😭
Egg should be cooked well...it has Salmonella bacteria
No
Eww no. Strain the noodles and drop it in hot. Mix it like a botlegged carbonara.
Please try chatt patta noddles of pakistan
This hack is so good, i've tried it twice and it was delicious
i wanna try it but i feel like the egg's still gonna be raw idkkk should i try??
I do this with kimichi shin noodles I add: 1. Tablespoon Kewpie mayo  2. Tablespoon rice vinegar 3. half a tablespoon sugar 4. The seasoning packets 5. Egg  6. 2 cloves of minced garlic  7. Kimichi  Then mix well And then I boil the noodles and use a small cup to add a bit of the water to the eggs while stirring and once i feel like its good enough i add the rest of the water with the noodles. For toppings I add more kimichi and spring onions.  The ingredients measurements can be changed to taste!
All you have to do is crack the egg into your boiled water  with your noodles and a little bit of butter for a minute or so. Very common ramen addition
No one gonna mention the raw egg or am I dumb?
Yuck 😫
Good lisa
Lisa is the queen of KPOP 👑 And you are the queen of ramen👑
I know who the originator of this hack is: some dude in prison
This is amazing  Looks super yumm
Paka leti anda
Lisa can u try indian noodle it's name Is (top ramen curry flavour....) N it's not ramen 😂 it's just the name
Ur voice is litterelly like u got cold 24/7
Might grab some ramen and try it for the first time tomorrow, gonna add in a Caroline reaper of course
Raw egg !??
Guys if u make this I recommend that u boil the soup part I mean the one with egg and mayo cuz the raw egg may taste a lil weird so it would be better it your boil it as well
Honestly shocked by the lack of knowledge she has about cooking. These videos are trash
The fact that the egg is still raw 🤢
Can't wait to try this! Already have all the ingredients, looks like dinner for me and the husband is set tonight
Creamy?🤨🤨🤨
just did it and it was delicious
Yes 👍 I’m eating this one
I had bad memories with shin ramyun but I decided to give it another chance  I used this recipe and I can say it's definitely good n I'll try it again for sure
My stomach got so weak, it can't handle raw/not fully cooked egg now 😑
That egg is raw…
are you holding your nose? wtf is that voice lmao
Salmonella : am I a joke to you ?
The black shin are realy good but they should make an extra spicy one cuz they ain't spicy for me nomore
I just ate the same ramen but I did Not use Mayo I did it with chick fulay
After trying this once I havent been able to make ramen without an egg anymore B')
It is sireus raw egg
girlies i've been eating this for the last 3 months and i'll let u in on some secrets: use only the egg yolk, add more kewpie mayo than the vid and for the garlic you can get cold pressed garlic that comes in a tube so you don't have to pull out your cutting board and knife for this otherwise simple emal
I tried but cup version
Any egg substitute's?
I think they are spicy even with this hack
I respect how shes asking us for the originator of this ramen hack to give credits 👍
I tried it once but its tasted like macaroni pasta
Sheesh
How would regular mayo be?
I think it was jeenieweenie *if* *I’m*wrong* *then* *correct* *me* *please*
Can you eat we'd your face if you bite a food without you showing who bites the food...
Instead of minced garlic, I put minced ginger and it was still good 🤡
I hv only 1 shin ramen and i hv never tasted the classic one so only if this one tastes good I'll tryyy it..
Can u teach how to make vegan ramen 🍜
You try panipuri,momos
I want to try shin ramen itself .....but I thing I don't know is whether it is veg or not ..I'm both veg and non veg eater , non veg only eggs and chicken I eat ....but some says that the seasoning contains beef / pork powder,whch I can't eat........... I hope I get this question clarified
Everyone: wow that looks good  Me: she eating raw egggg
this is how i make my noodles now
soooooo gooooooooooood
it would be so good I am gonna try this y7mmm ramen 🍜
i have no idea who you are 🙂
Is there a vegetarian replacement for egg
Oooh gotta try this with my favorite instant rama mama duck or pork
yes,it was EWWWWWWWW
Wow chị người Việt á
And taraa , you got salmonella 😃
When you're pouring the water you should hold back the noodles with your chopsticks.
Best ramen I've ever ate
is it okay to use other brand mayo?
Hell nah, aint no way i put mayonin my ramen.
can you do it with just Normal Mayo?
This ruined my day
tbh im kinda scared about the egg for me cuz i feel like i’d be eating raw eggs lol when in actuality their being cooked with the hot water, idk i still get that feeling that they arent cooked, its prolly cuz im too scared to get salmonella or smthg lol, someone pls help change my mind i think im prolly the only one concerned about this in the comments lol
Samenella?
I tried this hack with maggi It was not good lol I think it's cos Maggie is already not so spicy or flavourful.
Lisa, you should try to make the ramen porridge! Its like porridge but with ramen, ramen soup, eggs and rice etc. I tried it before and it was delicious
Yall I did this hack today and guess what  I overcooked the noodles and ruined it but it the taste was too good
The fact that she literally ate raw eggs💀
It’s funny to see everybody eating noodles besides Asian these days black people eat them for at least 40 yrs Doctoring them up with all type of things you know it was poor folks food. Good eats
That looks so good I wish I can try it
You lost me at mayo. Add in a clove of garlic, some bean sprouts, sliced jalapeños, some chopped cilantro instead and you're golden
Sad I’m allergic to it egg and mayo
I tried it, it’s pretty good! I don’t recommend the garlic though, the aftertaste stays for a while. But otherwise I would make it again!                 P. S. I don’t like garlic
Get the black one
This makes it tastier because they're all combined so it gives a richer and stronger taste
Do you have to use kewpie mayo or can I use normal mayo?
Oh hell yea, I did this way for the longest time. I’m very surprise people just found out now.
Tried this and now I have diarrhea. Wouldn't recommend if u have a sensitive stomach
Nope. Not eating a raw egg. Not even a half raw Egg
I would prefer it without the broth, it would get too bland in my opinion as I like spices
Is it just me or why do I think this is weird cuz when I make ramen I add the seasoning to the water of ramen  (Pls tell me someone does this too pls😭 XDD)
Isn’t it RAW egg
Raw egg 🙄
What type of Mayo?
Thats actually just a fancy prison spread. Common in prison: noodles, mayo, chopped sausage
I didn’t have the the kewpie mayo or minced garlic so I just used regular mayo and it was so good!!
this was amazing! just tried this out but changed it up a lil bit. I did not put any kewpie mayo cuz i dont have some but instead i added a little bit of butter. Even without the mayo, the egg makes the ramen creamy and i still loved it! Shared this midnight snack with my mom and she loved it so much she wants to buy me a whole pack of Shin ramen (this ramen is not popular in my country Philippines so its a big deal for me. Di na puro lucky mee hahahaha) hahaha! Thank you for this ❤️
The fact that you are eating raw egg 🥚😳
That is one spoon for me
But this is raw egg  😩
But I don't like mayo 😂
But the flakes seasoning won't be cooked
🍜🥰😍😘😋👌👍
Life saver thank you so much 😊 this is what I’m looking for ❤️
The use of scissors makes it official  I am making ramen like this from now on
Tbh, I just think the egg is a LITTLE unnecessary. I mean (as a ramen connoisseur) whipping cream does just fine and also makes a very rich creamy broth. I'd rather use cream in the base then put scrambled eggs or a fried egg on top
Have. You tried. This?
Eat RAW EGG D:
Raw egg
Dattebayo !
As a college student, I've tried almost all of ramen flavours also bunch of its hacks. Fortunately, my mom always send me a tray of eggs. I'll definitely add this one to my list
I'm watching this while eating maggi:)
i usually put 2 eggs, some soy sauce, cheese and the ramen water stirr then put noodles in and eat
Okay so I’m gonna try this but I only have normal mayo I’ll message back later as to what happens.
The originator of this hack was last scene at the hospital getting a bypass surgery and a stent.
Never heard about this hack. Always put mayo in noodles what most of people think is crazy. Will try this one, looks good
Is it just me who is bothered by her anti-clockwise stirring? 🤔
워매 한국라면으로 일본라멘을 만들어부렀네
I can't eat that, knowing how the egg is "cooked". Hmmm....... eh.
Mayo? Gross
Jesus loves you
No way that egg was cooked in that manner
This looks so good
Mmm 🤔
Not really a hack is it
That’s a raw egg
666k likes brih
did u see the likes
Is the Japanese version of Pasta alla carbonara
No thanks i prefer not to get food poisoning
I'm getting so hungry 😭
I don't know but who is highly keep on requesting you to do this kind of stupidity.🤔
"It was creamy"
I don't like mayo
Confused where is the hack
*me try the viral noodles* *My first taste* *Me dies from spicyness*
Dattebayo
I should try this! I don’t really like spicy things
You forgot the chili oil 😔
I’m currently eating this for breakfast right now even though I already had other food to eat for breakfast
Uhhmmm not sure if this is a hack but we been doing this for our noodles ever since. But what we do is we add the egg when the noodles and seasonings are all boiling in the pot then we stir them all together. Any filipinos here?
Next time, try it as the Japanese have it. Udon noodles, a flavorful Japanese soy sauce, and a raw egg topped with green onions. Boil the noodles and strain, then put the noodles in the bowl, crack the egg, drop that sucka. Pour some soy sauce and top with green onions. Mix well, enjoy!
🤢
I wanna love your channel but the fact that you always sound like you need to blow your nose makes me antsy and wanna blow it for you.
Try sandwhich with corn cheese
You should remove the egg yolks it taste better that way
I've tried this hack before, and I felt sick after. ☹ maybe because of the raw egg IDK :(( It was good though
🤮🤮🤮🤢 raw egg with Ramen
im gona ttu this im kinda scared lol
U should mix all your favorite ramens
Add some chopped green onions then decide to cut it with scissors HAHAHA
If we cut open her stomach, we'll get a good tour of RAMEN LMFAOO 💀
Does normal mayo work?
for me i just drop a raw egg or two to make it taste better
Garlic and mayo? Interesting. I have seen the videos of Lisa adding a ramen to her egg but garlic and Mayo sounds weird.
i did it the wrong way round and added the egg and sachet into the hot pan...
She added mayonnaise…..
The egg is raw though
Dattebayo
You can also add cheese! 😋
LISA NUH-GOO-YEN
Do you just have permanent cold?
Eww raw egg
Welcome to Italian cooking
Some veg remen hacks please
Can you do halal food
Lisa, you should make ramen how I make it!   1. Boil your ramen 2. In a pan combine soy sauce, minced garlic, and the seasoning packets 3. Add whatever extra seasoning you want  4. Put in the noodles 5. Add an egg
🤮🤮🤮
Thats a frickin raw egg 🥚
An uncooked egg!!!
Omg try it with shin ramen black it’s so much better 🥴
How to you know if it fully cooks the egg Edit: that’s the only reason I’m hesitant to try this
Raw egg 😖yuck
reminds me of neoguri w cheese
This isn’t a hack this is just cooking
Yakkhh raw egg...
Raw egg does this work in America?
Dam
Hey you should make ramen how i make my ramen! (I use the beef ramen)  1- use 1 1/2 cup of water and put it in a pot 2- put it on medium heat and pour your seasoning packet in and stir 3- then put your ramen and cover it for around 3-5 minutes 4- in a bowl put sesame seeds, sesame oil and hot chili oil and pour in your ramen! 5 stir together and enjoy!
I don't think raw egg can be pasturized by hot water.
What kinda mayonnaise?
This looks like a tan tan ramen from gomatei
Imma try because I don't like spicy food because it gives me interjection
Smell of raw egg is not so good.😝
You ate a Ra egg
Noo
God bless❤️

It ruins the taste 🙄 horrible
dude i swear i have like a phobia of raw/runny eggs- HOW ARE PEOPLE NOT CONCERNED THAT THIS IS RAW EGG- i would love to try this but wouldnt be able to eat the raw egg :I
"Is too spicy"  Me and my ancestors: Ehhh yea it was fine
It's so tasty.. I got surprised when i first tried it and kinda like it.. Just make sure the water is so hot so the egg will be cooked properly and you won't get diarrhea 😁
Could u do.. Chilli oil ramen noodles?
The egg is maybe uncooked
be careful doing this though, you might get food poisoning!
Do we have to use the kupe mayo ? Or is normal fine
Salmonella feast
RAMMENNNN
Me eating the Raman while watching this-
If you want spicy noodles get samyang.
I would die with the smell of a raw egg ☠️
Currently omw to get the ingredients.
It is night right now and I am so hungry
Tried these noodles for the first time recently. I can handle spice, but it was more a really strong version of the black pepper back-of-your-throat spice rather than tongue spice, which made it kinda unpleasant. I'm gonna try this.
Raw egg?
I made this hack                  Jk lmao ;)
Raw egg?
I always mix in a raw egg it makes it super yummy
*makes carbonara with extra steps*
So I'm dumb what kinda mayo
Are you eating raw egg in this?
Does it taste like egg?? Any reply’s halp
im eating spicy ramen with milk inside 😭
Fun fact:some ramen factory use bones instead of wheat for ramen but i said some so still theres factory using wheat :0
It looks good ya know
The shin ramen noodles aren't spicy and have no flavor   :(
라면이 다 불었네요
Thanks alot I just got them and I didn't know what to do so I came across this vid and now I know what to do
Before I saw this video, I would always add an egg and make sort of an egg drop soup with the broth from the ramen and add the noodles after. Yes, adding the egg does help with the heat from spicier noodles, like Shin or Shin Black, my favorite. Sometimes I like to add small chunks of mozzarella cheese too.
I'm too late to try the ramen have
What if u don't have kewpie Mayo or regular Mayo cld i make it without it???
I tried this today and swapped with the available Maggie noodles and the seasoning packet that was inside....gotta say, I never liked Maggie noodles before and now I'm never gonna have it any other way than this....thanks Lisa...✌❤💯🔥

Please don't eat raw egg.... It stinks 🥲... You can't do that....😖
When you're late to the party but still got 7 million views :
Will the egg get cooked ?
I just tried it and it came out so delicious 🤤 thank you ❤️😀
Sooo was the egg still raw???
Chiiii🤢🤮
And?
You can achieve the same outcome if you boil the water, put in packets, let them rehydrate and disolve, put your ramen brick in, crack the egg and stir quickly for about 20 seconds, put it all in a bowl, mount with cold butter, add your green onion and stir before serving. Bullet proof.
It looks raw
What if you don’t have the Mayo?
Can you try this hack with a ramen base/noodles
Id love to do this but I absolutely hate mayo,, it makes me wretch, i cant sit next to anyone eating with mayo😭😭
OMG I just did this hack today 😋 I would look for YT channel - Aaron and Claire.
شكلي واني ما فهمت ولا نص حرف 🙂
😆🤮🤮🤮🤮
I want to try this!
Eeww....
It was the Batman
It's not good for health
We've been eating instant noodles like this for 35 years... Why do people act like adding green onions, eggs, any kind or stir fry, tomato salsa, fish balls, dumplings is a new thing and a "hack"?
I just tried this today and it's so delicious 🤤
I prefer cooking noodles with the soup, it helps the noodles absorb all the flavours
Adding some sesame oil makes it so much better
I tried this with maggi and its great!
Egg is not cooked. Raw egg is risky to eat.
It turned out really good, good garlic flavor 😋
To whoever is reading this Jesus loves you and he’s coming soon. All you need to do to be saved is believe that Jesus Christ died on the cross for your sins was buried and came back to life on the 3d day confess with your mouth Jesus is Lord and you’ll be saved. Today is the day of salvation tomorrow is not promised and you don’t want to miss the rapture it will be so bad like nothing ever seen before on earth. God bless!!
Cookies noodles as directed. When finished add an egg to the top and cover for 10 minutes. Stir with a little soy and furikake. Tremendous
Can you substitute regular mayo for this? I don't have kewpie.
No
Lol I did it every time when I saw it on TikTok
Making it rn 😉
😋
Is this fvckin good or not yall?
Trying it now
Yuck mayo wtf kinda taste budz do u have 🤬🤢🤮
Is this ramen veg???
Ayo😳
Can you do this with reg ramen
I can't eat it it's look ugly and I love egg but I  hate raw egg  and the noodle look so bad with egg soup 👎🤮🤮
That looks juicy. Nice and creamy.. 💀
I love ramen I’m eating some right now lol🍜🍜🍜🍜🍜🍜🍜🍜
Fuck mayo
Why eggs??? 🤢🤮
I instantly got a watery mouth watching this looks so good
Think a non mayo guy would like this? Or is there an alternative
Raw egg?🙂
I made the same thing but in a different way but accidentally make the soup chunky because it partially cooked some of the egg
Doesn't it smells like raw egg? Honestly I hate the smell of raw egg that's why I'm a little scared to try this...
What can we replace the egg with in the recipe
It was that one guy The one with the shoe he has a shirt on The one with the hat he stays with that one person The one with that video yeah that guy
Hi. Can you try filipino pasta for a week? :) i love your vids
Calories count?
i would love to try this but i’m allergic to egg :,D
I just use the yolk
Hi Lisa  Please make ramen with Maggie because I'm form India and only have that
O tried this without the egg and added the seasoning , m8ned garlic and mayo and Added the boodles with the water.....Honestly in starting it tasted pretty good but at yhe end the taste grew kinda weird and Gross.....So I am never gonna try it again 🙃
Try indomie its the most delicious noodle.
I tried this with some chicken flavored ramen and it made it 10x better! Definitely want to try it with the shin ramen next time!
I wonder if its possible without the mayonaise?? I dont rlly like mayonaise...
Cantaloupe Island in the background???
Yooooo, i just tried and this tasted so good i kid you not! 😋
The comment section is killing me, have y'all not heard about carbonara??!  I swear americans only eat 5 minute mac n cheese🤦‍♀
This “hack” has been around since I was a kid…I’m 50+
All you did was add an egg and mayo, then temper the egg.
Just a question I had a Friend on discord name Liz I forgot the tag lol u look quite Identical to her so are u her? We meet on the only sus game among us U know maybe u just call yourself Lisa bc it sounds a lil better :)
Tried this with Maggie really nice must try
Why do you always sound sick?
I've done this before u should also fry some sandwich meat with chopped garlic and add them on top it's really good
Damn that looks good
This is not a hack, this is a recipe
I've never heard of this but looks like I've been doing this without knowing lmao. I make my noodles almost similarly to my dad. He adds a raw egg on top of them while I add the raw egg at the bottom of the bowl and pour in the broth without breaking it. If I want a creamy broth, I stir the broth into the egg, same as the video.
I swear you can just add egg to ramen and its the exact same thing why all the extra squid for no reason?
My kids stand by hacks not my experience or knowledge, guess I'll just shut up pay bills cuz they know better
Omg it’s sooo good!!
Your voice is very boring. You sound like recording audio is a chore.
Ramen 🍜.  Yummy yummy 🤤
TOO EASY 💪
*creamy*
Tried It Today with  Mama DnDn Oriental Pork Flavor Noodles 🍜  Love It!
Try the chili oil ramen plss
I'm so used to eating spicy food that when I eat foods that are meant to be spicy but have other ingredients added to it to make it less spicy,I feel nauseous. Idk..
FUIYOH
I never tried those noodles because I heard they were spicy and I have a stomach acid condition & plus I cannot stand even a freaking hot fry or hot Cheeto without being in massive mouth pain. It’d be so cool if this really destroyed the spice
Awful
Looks disgusting
It takes too long
Shin isn’t too spicy but I must try this, as I am The Ramen Cult Leader
Trying this now
i do this but without green onions and i also add on siracha and add like cheese on top its so creamy and good and if you wanna step it up, put some milk in it itll change yo life i swear
IS THAT A RAW EGG-
so you essentially make a tare for instant ramen? that's actually pretty cool
I don't find one pack spicy enough anymore. I use an extra broth packet to add a little more spice to shin 😅
I did this and it is SO AMAZING!!
Bah disgusting
mmm Japanese salmonella  salad
I don’t like mayo, does anyone know of something I could replace it with?
Today I was board and I put soup in my spaghetti and I pretended it was ramen 😂
Does the egg is cooked ??
I subbed for my bro
Your name actually must be Lisa ramyen 🤣🤣
Who else just loves watching Youtube Shorts!
You're gonna get salmonella
Are you Korean or jepanis
Interesting might try it someday
I really find it nasty when the egg isn't cooked while the noodles is still boiling. The broth just becomes murky and it appalls me a little.
doesn’t it taste bland tho? I never had it so just acting
Is this healthy food it don’t look like it.
Just made it! Hope it tastes good!
Why do you eat it like that
Why does is sound like you have something stuff up in your noes?
🤮🤢🤢🤮🤮🤢🤢 raw egg
Does that really taste good with the raw egg?
I got salmonella from that the egg isn’t cooked enough….
Its not a mistake ✨ITS A MASTERPIECE ✨
Yummmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Had Shin ramyun for the first time today and it was sooo good wasn't even that spicy
No one can defeat hati meercha its a chilli try this and you will 😅😯😧😱😵👻
Its disgusting i tried it
What kind of mayo?
How you can eat a ripen egg 🥚😖😖😖
That looks gross!
I love this hack been doing it for awhile
Can you try Mr. Kimchi stir fry ramen 😀
Does this season or noodles have shrimp 🍤 in them
Nah... Egg not cooked enough for me 😭
I don't like egg put in noodle soup
Mayo...
no egg?
Why don't you take the egg seasoning and put it on the noodles drained of water, and fry it all?
Just add some cornstarch...easier and less calories 😉
Really Love this recipe so much. I would definitely loved to make it. It's looking certainly fabulous and tempting . Thanks for sharing stay connected 💖☺️
Can u try this with Indian Maggie plz Lisa ❤️🙏🙏🙏
Yumm
omg
Nah I don't eat raw eggs I'm not a savage tbh
I would eat this if the egg was cooked
The original version of this over 40 years old. It’s not new and tik tok and YT did not “discover” a this. It’s not a hack either, it’s called cooking.
I do this with tahini instead of Mayo/egg because eggs are gross
Bekaar🍜🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮
Tip: put as little water as you can so that the water becomes creamy instead of just water. Don’t know if I explained it right but if anyone wants me to elaborate I can always make a quick vid.
There is a technique in French cooking called liaison where you mix 1 parts egg yolk and 3 parts cream then put into a cooked sauce to give it richer taste & silky texture, this seems to be a poor man's version of this.
Oh hell no
Add a slice of white or yellow cheese plus crumble some lays sour green cheese cios at end oh yes yummy
Yummy ❤🔥❤🔥❤
Been doing this for like 15 years lol
hey lisa i wanted to say i really like ur cooking vids! and i wanted to say thanks because when i watch your vids i wanna cook, and im getting into cooking! so thanks:Ddd
Her: Makes it And loves it and is fine the next day Me: enjoys It but gets sick and the Er Tells me i have food poisening a day later
Not sure why it’s called a viral hack.. 😂 My family & relatives have been cooking ramen (the best one being shin black ramen) with egg for ages.. More flavour in the soup when u mix everything. It’s definitely better to put the egg together with the soup when it’s cooking as the egg cooks better.
#NewViewer BTW💙💚❤️🖤I’ve never tried this before😎
Ain’t nothing cooked about that egg.
Usually do all the seasoning stuff tossed into boiling water first. Add egg(s) appropriate to portion size, add thickening agent like condensed milk or mayo, add sesame oil, make sure egg(s) is evenly combined with soup, then add in the noodles to boil with ingredients. Usually flavours the noodles better than boiling in water to soak in soup later.
I learnt it from the university of the matrix and Mayrix reloaded
Your Videos Make Me Hungwy :)
If you hate mayonnaise use sour cream instead, it's good
You’re acting like this is gourmet this started as prison food
I might be weird , but I can't eat egg like this . I NEED FULLY COOKED EGGS . It disgust me and make me gag , seeing egg half cooked or raw really is against my cooking ethics . I really admire who can eat raw egg or semi cooked egg like a delicacy.......
The noodles ain't spicy to me.
She always sounds like she's getting over a cold.
The scissors ✂️ made me cringe 😬
If the noodles are spicy try going to your nearest YT friend. The family knows how take the spice right out. ☺️😌
I was SO DISAPPOINTED that I don't like it when I tried Kewpie mayo.
By "hack" do you mean "recipe?"
n00b, you need to add meat 🍖
Mix the egg with hot milk instead!!
Wonderful 👍🏻
ewwww
You only eat ramen?
im still in the middle of trying it
🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤. I love ramen. Makes me my time in 🇰🇷.
Can you except a challenge given by me 🥺 please
It's been long since I've seen your videos.. another good one. Thanks for sharing.
This ramen hack is amazing and actually the way I’ve been doing my ramen for a little over a year now
Those noodles suck there way too hard but I would definitely try this method with any other brand of instant noodles on the shelves
Egg raw im good
Then my fav noodles but I can’t do no damn raw egg I prefer a fried egg over my noodle
Carbonara?
Is the viral thing from salmonella? 🤭🤭🤭
Don’t eat ramen packets. So much sodium nitrate
The Mayo is really what makes the hack good and my mom is the originator. Her name is Kelly.
Just thank the college student
me currently eating THAT basic cup o noodles ramen
I saw someone do it with egg yolk only
Let's not forget my old goto, Nacho Cheese, Cracked Ramen, Shredded Chicken, Crunched Doritos and Pepper Flakes.
This looks good I definitely need to try…Thanks for sharing
This is, without a doubt, the dumbest generation of all time.
yeee
Instead of mayo try cream cheese or whipped cream cheese
shin already taste good
But those cheap noodles have a green word consistency
No😨
Uncle Roger : No Package Noodle
Just saw the video and tried it instantly. This has actually changed my perspective. It's too good.
Shin ramyun noodle is spicy? I can only giggle as an Indonesian
won't the raw egg give you salmon vanilla?
What about the raw egg smell?
🤮🤮
IM DEF GONNA TRY THIS TOMORROW…looks so good 🤤😊
Yuk I hate raw egg in things even with the hot water it's still raw to me.
To the woman speaking, Do you have a deviated septum or allergies?
Jesus's song everything you want
I heard about the egg before, but not garlic & mayo. But I hate mayo of any kind so this doesn't sound good to me.🙁
😯 huh? someone finds Shin Ramyun too spicy vs. me who still adds chili powder/oil to my shin ramyun.
I usually just boil my ramen, mix in the ingredients, then I add eggs and mix😊 it’s sooo good
I like your voice
Um, the egg is still raw inside idc what else was mixed in with it.
This is diarrhea waiting to happen
"if you know who made this hack let me know" That one guy: "IT WAS ME NOT THAT GUY
Bro that looks bussin as shi🔥
Yep 👍 its good 😊 yum
🤮
Raw egg...Naw I'm good lol
Im not eating a raw egg
The Mayo part is interesting because it’s just egg and oil
Doing this within the next hour.
I've been meaning to try this but haven't gotten around to it. And we had a snow storm last week and today it's 60 mile an hour winds snow and sleet so i won't be making it to the store anytime soon but when i do I'm definitely trying this. It looks delicious. I have everything i need but no eggs go figure.
try it with milk and cheese as well, amazing^^
I did this in 2012.. I like to add Milk tho and sometimes a bit soy sauce. In general I'd say I just like to mix it up cuz I eat ramen quite often
pls do day how much ramen cost...
Haiya, packet Instant noodle.
I just use raw egg, unironically
Her:puts so much Mayo   Me:…why though WHY
You didn't cooked the egg ughh
i think egg are still raw
Everytime i would try to crack open a egg trying to put it in my noodles the yolk always break :(
Iv tried this and to me personally it was not good to me because of the mayo not for me but I’m not a huge fan of mayo either unless it’s mixed with tuna or a small amount on a burger
Mayonnaise in ramen r u kidding me
Every time some people eat Rahmen their mouth fills with ulcers because of the concentrated prawn faces that is the main source of the flavouring. Observe yourself after eating Rahmen.
How to get salmonella
Just got done eating this ramen but I ad the veggie packet to the cold water as it cooks then heat some oil while the noodles boil and mix the sizzling oil into a bowl with the seasoning packet drain the noodles when they are cooked to your liking then mix the noodles into the oil seasoning mixture it makes the spice really pop try it out!
Isnt ramen and noodles harmful for your body too? I think they dont come under healthy part of the chart can anyone confirm this pls?
I just use a little cheese. 🤷
Who puts mayo in for a thickener
Is the chopped onions  optional or do I have to do it
I need to do this while I'm home alone
If I learned this 20 years ago I’d be king of my block 😂
Im not sure how this is a "hack". But I've never heard of it. And I don't plan on trying it. Its just gonna make me sick.
Her voice sounds like she's sick.
Are their any good ramen packs that aren’t spicy?
Try it with chick fil a sauce
My whole life I've eaten ramen with the broth and people told me that I'm eating it wrong and that your supposed to eat it with no water. But now that i see that i was right I'm very happy
Try Lucky Me mami or pancit canton
Me who adds Hot sauce to everything…
This is basically the only way I eat ramen now, I use a homemade spicy mayo and I use more water and more mayo and it's wonderful
This been a jail meal forever.
I tried this with the regular chicken ramen noodles and it was pretty fire. Dont think ill be going back lmfao
Raw egg?
HAH! I’ve been doing this since I was 10 yrs old, when my parents would leave me alone at home with nothing to eat! Lmfao 🤣   Add hot cheetos crumbs! And spinach!
I'm not gonna try it tho I don't like egg that much
I really like ur voice
I absolutely love this trend ❤. This has become my standard way of eating my ramen🍜. I usually add an extra egg to the broth after eating the noodles and whisk and then fry as an omette or as super tasty scrambled eggs 😋.
Even lazier, just chuck in a slice of American cheese to the bottom of your bowl.
Also if you leave your ramen overnight put milk in the next day it makes it creamy
Years and years ago, Andy of Shinhwa added milk to his ramen! So this is, more or less, a similar recipe.
Can you do a recipe for most kids that adults also like as well??
Me and my roommate were doing this 10 years ago. Stay thirsty internet
Are u related to ben nyugen
Eww. Why would you even add a raw egg
This make my stomach grambeling Btw your voice is very sweet
Am i the only one who doesn't like watery ramen?
I did this today and I almost died from the heat. It’s tasted good but I could not eat it all ❤️
Yuck raw egg
Mere ko bhi ek dedo
😋😋😋😋
Wait this looks so good
I’ve done this by accident lol
It’s kylie Jenners ramen 🍜
Mouth watering....
😋🥡
Thank you ☺️
I don't know how to hold a chop stick 🥲
Mayonnaise YUCK
John 3:16 For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten son, that whosoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life.   Here’s a reminder of how much God loves you. God bless you🤍
"hack"... It's called cooking by tempering your eggs so they don't instantly curdle
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
LOL it's 2022 😁
I'm hungry..
Stomach ache? Any?🤢
The problem I don't like 🥚eggs🥚🥚🥚
Ewww mayo😝
Gonna try this with buldak
Tried it today. Was kind of concerned about the Mayonnaise but it turned out really tasty. Thx for sharing. Greetings from Germany.
No I just watch your videos
Oh hell this hack is for you to die faster I don't think you supposed to mix ingredients without boiling it along the ramen this is skipping your 1-2 years dying from your routine ramen eating
When i do it i just crack an egg when my noodle is almost done
raw egg brooo
IT'S RAW the chicken is laying an egg inside the bowl
Definitely trying this
That’s way too much work bro. 🗿 Also don’t trust that one dude suggesting you try bone broth. Only eat boneless ramen. 👌🗿
I usually prefer Japanese rice-ramen/noodle that you can get in tall packages at the supermarket just like pasta. Mainly because instant ramen is wheat. Also, a teaspoon of rich soy oil makes the broth taste extra nice.
Your voice gets into my nerves
Can i use normal hot water? Noodle water is gross
Can you also do this without the egg because i cannot eat eggs😭
I can't stand the smell of raw egg
JIN 🍜 RAMEN
Looks good.  But her voice…. Girl clear your sinuses out!! Lol
a hack for ramen noodles. unbelievable.
These are my fave noodles to use. I haven't seen them in any stores here in the last few weeks. Seems to be a shortage?
Pour plain egg into the boiling broth, then transfer into bowl an add seasonings/ mayo
I  hate  🥚🐣🍳🥚🐣
The golden balance is the original creator
Raw egg🤢🤢🤮
uh dont know about the raw egg but looks nice
Hmmmm, it's the raw egg for me
Minus the egg yoke
its 5 am and im hungry why am i torturing myself by watching this
Salmonella
Mmmm great
Love the Shin ramen... it's been my favorite for many years now. Occasionally, I'll use less of the seasoning if I feel I want it less spicy, but typically use the full packet.   *if I do use less, I'll usually add a little extra soy sauce and black vinegar, and sometimes some chicken bouillion powder as well.
I eat my ramen dry. And those noodles are not that spicy. Little spicy. Good flavor tho.
Been done this since I was a kid
It’s a bit easier to bring water to a boil in a pot, put the seasoning and other ingredients in, then the egg, mix it in or don’t either way it’s good. Then put the noodles in when the egg has been sitting for about 2 minutes.
What's with people and mayo trust seeing that junk made me wanna throw up
If you think it's too spicy,  you could also just use less of the seasoning or none at all
I used maruchan noodles as a sub for shimranyun... 😳 it was nice and creamy (I prefer more spice  so I think I’ll use shimranyun next time)
Thank you and God bless
This looks so good
ooh! I want to try this with the pancit canton’s sauce.
Tip: Use roasted fresh garlic... and add Vietnamese basil, same one used in Pho.. add a few wontons.. amazing.
Someone needs to blow their nose lol
Did I get plastic with it
bt Salmonella....
If this put into perspective I'm a whole universe behind. Hack! never even heard nor think of it before
🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
I tried this with the same ramen because I love that ramen and it is so good I highly recommend it it's Bussin
Bro we got the same pack XD
bros really trynna do a salmonella speedeun 🗿🗿🗿💀💀
Looks delicious, but I’m not tryna eat raw eggs 😬
Noodle Plop for the win!
In america, is the egg safe like that?
Uh yeah eggs definitely still raw in there
She sounds like she has a cold all the time
🔇🔈🔉🔊
I feel bad for the homies that can't handle shins spice level lol
I want to try but I don’t have kewpee mayo can I use normal with some lemon?
I throw a slice of American cheese and one egg when the noodles almost done
It's Italian....... carbonara!
What’s the point of the egg?
Ok:'experience has been something
This sounds pretty similar to how you make custard, which, if I’m not mistaken, involves heating a beaten egg slowly with milk so that it doesn’t scramble
You can use American cheese to also make the broth creamy
please don't eat raw eggs 😬
I've always made mine adding Mayo, Sesame oil, soy sauce and vegetables/meat it just makes packet ramen taste and feel more like a proper meal.
Guess I'm the only one who eats ramen with raw egg.
Shin is my favorite Ramen!  Try it with cheese too!!  Delicious!!
It’s because you are famous and you can’t keep up with everyone. We get it!!!!
with a raw egg?
Is this really a hack? Been doing this since i was a kid😆😆😆😆 asians be like😜😜
I tried this immediately after watching the video and I can confirm that it was great!
no no no dont tell me you tried mayonaise with instant ramen no no no
Try ramen sour cream cheese onions and a juicy medium rare steak
Salmonella xd
I’m not sure who it is but it looks magically delicious
mama
It looks good, but I would keep out the mayo. I hate mayonnaise.  It's gross😂
…
That hackers from me
Idk why but this was going on inside my head: “Do you ever look at someone and wonder, ‘What is going on inside their heads?’”    (Dont ask me why
Its 2022
Raw egg? No thanks
I always have a problem of the little egg pieces being too cooked for the egg broth to be broth. How do I fix it?
U late to the hack, I’m late to the video
Someone please create gluten free ramen noodles!!!
Happy new year Lisa sis
You always sound sick
LISA I THANK YOU  THE  NOODLES CAME OUT GOODY GOOD 👍 . BY THE WAY I ALSO LIKE TO EAT COLD 🥶 PIZZA 🍕YOUR NOT ALONE .🤓
How is this a hack? It's like saying I bought a cheese pizza and added toppings.
I can attest, this way is best.
🤢 🥚 but looks good tho 😊
Yum
"Plop" Okay, I see my mission
Oh my gosh I llllooovvveeee 😻ur voice it is sssoooo satisfying 😇it soothes my soul 😂
This looks so good
But.. Dont everyone know broth is just flavored water? You can make broth out of anything, ive been experimenting with ramen for the majority of my college life, velveeta cheese slices are key to thickening your broth for extra heft without changing the flavor (one cheese slice makes it feel creamy and doesnt make it taste like cheese), a tea spoon or half spoon whatever of garlic oil, some flavored seasoning packets for cooking (chicken, beef, ham, ribs) whichever combination you want to do, but dont be dumb, as well as canned liquids like campbells french onion stock cans or cream of potato really help broaden up the taste and heft, add in a bunch more ramen packets and can feed your friends and family quite well,and tasty, only problem is you get some stinky poops if you go the french onion can route, very tasty but expect some nasty bathroom cleanups  P.S. cans of veggies or my favorite, shredded green beans, really make any soup worth eating when you add them in there, potatoes and carrots obviously make the soup much more fun and less boring
Her food looks like what actual food advertisements are suppose to look like
how can I block her videos...
But the egg in the solution was still uncooked 👀
Add it while cooking stir then the sauce
I’ve been adding a egg to my ramen since 2009 😂
My dad had done this for the better part of 66 years, yes he ate ramen as a baby
Sorry but it’s kinda gross sorry if I’m offending you
Looks disgusting 😒
🤮
How can u eat raw egg 🥲🥲i just gag 🤢
Uncle roger plssssss
I'm the originator of this hack it's was started on 04 20 1990..   lol
Is it just me or i can smell it through the screen 😀
Does it work if you have regular mayo?
Super Unhealthy.
Forgot to add cheese slices. Yum
Yeah I have but I also put honey as well
Just break the egg right into the boiling water, it cooks real good that way.
I can chug all of those at once
🍜
🍜
Me: *eat the ramen.*
Gotta try this
Raw egg and noodles some hack....
That is super spicy and gun
Couldnt you just use corn starch ??? with the egg
We use to make this in jail...just FYI.
I’m so hungry now
ARE YOU DIANA NGUYEN FROME BOJACK HORSEMAN?
What the difference between kewpi mayo and regular mayo????
I feel bad for anyone who says Shin Ramen is spicy
Hello!!! I saw this yesterday and now I tried it!!! It taste awesome
Pls try  . 1st boil water for 1 minute and 30 sec  . 2nd put noodles in the hot water let it boil for 1 minute and 30 sec . 3th put seasoning in contaner where you boil noodles and water let it boil for two minutes
the original is like doobydobap something i think
Tried this lots of times! The seasoning is too salty for me that's why I put only 1/4-1/2 of it into my bowl and gradually adjust it when it doesn't taste good in the end.
I love SHIN noodles...they are the best...I use a little heavy cream and unsalted butter...so good
I thought the caption said I HATE not “late”
Nah Fam this Ain't it Playa Next
Uh I'll just do that normal one
Try a bit of pb or pb powder in with the egg too!!! <3
No eggs for me
Wow
I have tried this a long time ago
Yo what if you don’t have an egg
Ewww🤮🤮🤢
Yummy
😋😋😋😋🤩
Shut up
Drooling rn lol!
Raw eggg are you mad 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
"It was creamy"      That's what she said.....
No I haven't tried that. I kinda like not having diarrhea..
Ngl it sounds disgusting. Never liked creamy coloured and tasting ramen. Id rather saute garlic and fry a crispy egg with runny yolk in shin black
My sound was gon in like 1 second of watching
Hello I m planning to buy a Ramen but I don't know which one is good can someone  me?
🤮🤮
Well now that the concept of savory custard with mayo is in my head I'm grossed out  I'm sure it tastes good just not for me
I cannot eat uncooked egg🤡
Another great thing for dialing the spice down is butter i use it sometimes for the spicy paldo ramen when i dont feel like burning up
looks delicious😍🥰
Hi Lisa I’m Nathan I’m from Ireland cork city to be exact i just wanted to say your a good youtuber you make great content and I love it it’s just the food and everything interesting Asian type dishes it’s just mouthwatering really and I just wanna appreciate you making it thanks ❤️
my dad has done this and every time the ramen tastes amazing its 11 pm and now ⟟ want ramen ;-;
This is sacrilege
What did you squirt in there ? Mayo
Nice man!!! What do you think about my keyboard progression? Much love broskieeeee💗
This is actually my FAVORITE type of ramen pack 🍜  That’s not how I made it I think the instructions says to cook it in a pan if this is the same one…BUT..  there’s always different ways to do things ! That’s how we have SO much variety because of people playing around with food. Kind of like makeup ! There’s never a wrong way to do It, but you never know how the outcomes going to turn out lol
...
You just have to dump it all in and mix
Pop a kraft single in there instead of Mayo. Thank me later ;)
It’s crazy I’ve been doing this since I was like 11 it’s crazy good never used these noodles tho
Lololololol
I tried this and the creaminess of the egg makes the whole dish *Takes a deep breath* SHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESH
That's my favorite but with lemon it's even better
Madness.
It's hard to watch this channel when you're on a low carb diet!
Raw EGG
Can you just put any normal egg or a specific tupev
I'd rather have scrambled eggs on top so I can get fuller.  *Or I guess try this with eggs on top.
I might just be Asian but shin ramen isn't..very spicy  I really wanna try this still
Yours are some of the only Shorts I like! Keep 'em coming!😁✌❤
Thai Tea noodle
Which mayo
Its also full of chemicals and preservatives. Pre packaged meals are often full of them. Make sure you read the ingredient list before buying anything. I would only recommend eating this in a survival situation Where no other options are available.
No because that is so easy going hahahahaha
If shin ramen is spicy try SamYang it is even spicier. (Maybe there is one even spicier not other than the ghost pepper ramen)
From the spicy bureaus
That's what Naruto eats
Nope..😷
Can I use any type of mayo? Thanks
I would never dare to eat a raw egg
This is touch rules
Mixing ingredients isn't a hack....
Mmm my favorite shin noodle soup
There’s no limit with shin ramens. Eat it to how you desire to make it
Mayo in broth!? 🤢🤮
Blow ur nose.
Just made this, took me about 10 minutes and I’m really satisfied with the results! Plz keep making more 🖤
🥳🙌🏼☂️🌅♨️
The poor hungry man hack , ramen noodles,eggs and mayo
this looks rancid.
Uncooked egg! YUCK!
Nasty
Pomidorowa XDDD Ale nie żartujmy '_' pomidorowa jest najlepsza z kluskami 💗😑😌🥰🥰😍🤩
I love shin raymun noodles😛 im in germany and u can get them there🥰😜
Damn I forgot to do this I literally had the shin ramen 2 days ago. Nevermind I will try this next time.
Me who has not seen this hack 👁️👄👁️
Origonator was me 30 years ago lol...
0:31
The egg is still raw u donut 🍩
Looks good 😊
Is that mayo in ramen?
I like how you cut your onions
I tried it. It’s so good
Do you need to use kewpie mayo
I'd add some cheese n maybe some kind of meat
I can taste the salmonella 🤣 Haha jkjk
Youtube wont let me block you. This is harassment
I can’t believe people find shin ramyun TOO spicy……….. cmon y’all.
Hell naw egg not done corina virus
Your voice is hate full uhh
That's disgusting
I would have food poising if I eat raw egg
Raw egg???
Good for you 😁😁 😘
🤮🤮🤢🤢🤢
i'm not sure about the whole uncooked egg ^^' i don't think adding a small amount of boiling water on it is enough
It looks like Asam Laksa
"I'm Surprisingly Surprised"
I hate egg smell🤢🤢
You can never be late to a food trend.
Who is watching this and finds this video interesting?
DID YOU JUST CUT SCALLIONS WITH A PAIR OF FOOKIN SCISSORS M8?!?! I GET IT BUT THIS IS BLASPHEMY
When you hate mayo : 😕
She really has the algorithm figured out lol
Ew so you're literally eating half raw eggs,,, I'm just too Choosy in food so don't mind me though
Sus lisa
Eso ni pica jsjsjsjs
well i have a similar idea. basically you put scrambled egg to the boiling water. add the seasoning to the boiling water. mix. the  boil noodles
Eonnie ar you korean or Chinese or Japanese !?
Nah fam I'm good
Um....  theres a raw egg in that! Ewwww
i love this kind of noodles the spicy taste but samyang is more spicy
I never understood why spicy food gets so much hate, it tastes amazing and it’s good for you so why do people feel the need to coverup the spice flavor
I cannot eat anything with starch water. I always rinse the starch from my noodles I hate sticky noodles idk that seemed to be the only thing to really turn me off abt it it look good I just hate the idea of pasta water idk why I just have to rinse my noodles 😂
Yo I have the same bowl
Lisa:I’m late to this viral ramen hack    Me:I’m late to this viral video hack 😭
Baaad idea... please try NOT to eat raw eggs. Greetings from salmonella.
Noodles watching 👀😋😌😍 cannncal communities  in have into a one there
That egg is not cooked wtf
So, what’s the hack?
That's pretty much raw egg. Nope
Not adding a slice of processed American cheese
Sapporo Ichiban are the best ramen noodles!
Creamyy👽
Please don't, this viral is old. Move on!
I have the same ramen at home shin
Can we use maggie for this ?
Bowl of diarrhea. Just fax bb.
If you declare with your mouth, Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. Romans10:9
I also add ginger (fresh or powdered) and soy sauce
Accept Jesus as your Lord and Savior and repent you shall be saved give it a try I mean accepting Jesus is a great thing cause if you do your safe from hell you might think hell isn't real but it is and heaven isn't boring ppl think heaven is boring but in fact, you can fly in heaven accept Jesus as your Lord and savior repent and always remember God does Love you
My Korean husband has been putting egg in his ramyeon for years. It's pretty common there.
It's Ramen _carbonara._ Always worth a try.
🤢🤮!!!!
Me who didn’t even know how to make broth until now and didn’t think of it thankyou some people even learned more from videos than school. I learned something new today
I'd add some extra chili flakes 👏🏻💯🔥
What is QP mayo?
Everyone in/coming up in poverty: been there, done it.   Butter instead of Mayo; optional cheese slice.
Ewwwww
IF YOUR IN AMERICA DONT DO THIS YOULL GET SALMONELLA
Shin ramen for the win
You have cold
I read the title as “I hate this ramen hack” 😂
I love eating ramen like this but every time I do, it kinda messes up my stomach :(
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
In Mexico we have the option to put mayonnaise in soups like alphabet soup, star soup, rice, ramen, in tortillas, tostadas, and obviously corn, etc, etc. Safe to say, with Peace and Love, there is no originator for this "hack", it's part of our culture. It's nothing "New". Bruh, there's probably other cultures that use mayonnaise differently or the same.
Bruh all you eat is Chinese food eat something else
Those eggs are definitely not cooked.
I’ll pass but do you.
Maggi is best than this maggi is so delicious
We've been doing this for years.  Due to no social media at the time there is no proof lol.
umm das raw egg?
Why? Just... Why!?
Uncook egg🤮🤮
Lisa can I ask u a question??
Boiled egg is better .
I tried this personally i recommend this way!! 10/10 ( i added a bit of tajin) it was yummy! You took my ramen to a whole new level. 👌🏻
Me who did this everytime not knowing it was a trend*
How do you make sure the egg is cooked though - should you gradually pour the water - & then after you put in the noodles, leave it for 3 mins, just to be sure?! Worry about getting an upset tum from none cooked egg - pls  advise🙏💜
Yum🙊💜(Although, if you buy Shin ramyeon - the "Gourmet Spicy" is not spicy (too spicy?! - these ppl are kidding.. I buy the Shin kimchi ramyeon - bc they are just lovely - not particularly spicy but nicely flavoured. Ah, I could live on Shim kimchi ramyeon they are the best)🙏💜
Can we do it with Maggi?
I'll have to try this sometime.  Those Shin Ramen noodles are not spicy to me.
But otherwise it was cReAmY Ayo your sus 🤨📸
The egg is still raw?
we had this and it was really really spicy
I hate mayu and i tried it was not good it was bussin
Surprisingly surprising
That looks so good!! 😍
Huh, I didn't know this is a viral hack. I've been adding raw eggs to hot noodles and stirring it vigorously to prevent the egg from clumping while cooking from the heat, and my brother had always cooked his noodles in a similar way since forever.
Hw do u people even eat raw egg😶😶?
What kind of mayo ? I never heard of this !
“It was creamy”
The original creator name is @nobody
I tried this today I liked it a lot !!!
My favorite is noodles, so I need to try this, I wanna know what it taste like
HẢO HẢO:))
WHY IS HER VOICE LIKE THAT LIKE  IS IT BECAUSE SHE EATS SPICY OR DOES SHE HAVE FLU
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻😎😎😎🪟😎🐻‍❄️🥇🥇🥇
Bruh is this woman immortal at diabetes
I tried this with different noodles and without the mayo and it was still good 😋
Can you use any mayo ?
Taehyung oppa will be finally able to eat shin ramen😂😂😂
I always put cheeses into the ramen
🤢🤢Oh, the wheezing and rancidity turned my stomach
Ew  What if that raw egg have something in there  Thats why always boil your egg
Adding cheese can make it creamy too
I tried this hack and it helped SO much. I' not a fan of spicy food so this really helped.
I feel like it would be better as a soup tasted nice tho
The spice is the best part!!
Just tried this, genuinely the best ramen I’ve had yet
This make me hungry
Those noodles are MILD what
What did you put?Is it fried minced garlic?and what the cream you put in?tq
Wait, this is a viral hack? I’ve been doing this for years and I’ve never seen anyone else talk about it
A big noo 🙂
are you Viet Nam people?
I wonder if you could switch the mayo for Dijon mustard to get that creamy yet spicy flavour.
I keep getting ramen videos I want ramen now
Trying it now, it’s very tasty—
This is such a good hack but next time I’m gonna add some shin powder to the cooking noodles because the noodles are a little bland other wise
I once ate shin ramyun without the egg, and my lips actually stung.
J.
Doesn't it taste starchy since u added it along with the water..nd the raw egg.. nevermind.. :-|
Eww!! That was a raw egg
Another  good Hot Dog  to try in New York City! Papya King
Bruh I'm from Malaysia and I actually add jalapeno in my shin ramen every time I make one 😂🤣
Instead of mayo, try soya sauce
Where can I buy the Mayo
I always add two eggs in my ramen as well as slice of cheese, it tastes creamy asf
Most definitely not using the egg
I am deffinatly doing this 🙃
Looks good but I would add seasoning to the noodles themself to blend with the broth then add them together
How did you eat raw egg🤮🤮
I making this tomorrow..
I been cooking Ramon wrong
Just made it gonna try it now Edit: I looooovvvveee ittt!!!!
Does regular Mayo work if I don’t have kewpie
What kind of mayo??
This girl sure loves ramen maybe she eats it everyday🥴😩✨✨
Some peanut butter too would give a twist
I wish I could eat noodles but kids can't eat noodles in South Africa because they were posianed 5 months ago
It looks so goood❤️👩‍🦲😨
Its just the same way of cooking but more steps 😅
It looked like the frozen ramen
Wtf raw 🥚egg
🤮
🤮🤮
Ramen isn’t good for you
Just maked this but without mayo I will be getting some tommorrow but I did make a mess bc I spilled some watwr
Raw egg.......😭😭
Can I have some
I enjoy your recipes... great video
i’m eating this i’ll give it a 7,5
It looks so delicious but I won't eat it 😅 . I don't eat raw/ half boiled egg . Idk why 😃
Can you try and make a porched egg
I usually cook the noodles like normal so they cook in the broth with the seasoning packet and then I add the broth in with the egg mayo and garlic. That way the noodles have more flavor.
i empty the flavor packets into the water with seaweed flakes and scallions,  bring to boil, then add noodles, then crack 2 eggs halfway through , add whatever hot oils or sauces i want n gently stir while the whites scramble n the yolks turn creamy.
Hmm what’s the point of the egg?  I don’t trust the cooking of the egg part.  But it looks good.
Ewwwwwww you
So what kinda mayo?
Get beef broth ramen instead to do this
Yes
Got a mild salmonella poisoning from this.
Ramen Carbonaraaa
Imagine thinking Shin ramen is too spicy 🥵 lmao
I love Shin ramen!! It burns my face off!!! 🔥🔥🔥 I think I'll try this anyway, it looks really good too. 👍
I do something similar but the egg usually goes in once the noodles have softened. I also didn’t add any Mayo but sriracha. This does look interesting tho....
Let do a collaborate please
Definitely not trying this!!!!!!
Apparently, _hack_ now means _follow a simple recipe._
You don't have to do all that. Just mix in some sour cream, it'll change your life 😏
Salmonella is making a dissertation
I have been doing this for 30 years. The only difference is the noodles were not the freeze dried type. The egg does make a world of difference.
I always cook the noodles with the season packs
I add the egg as boiling the noodles, get the white cooked but the egg soft boiled. I got it from a Korean cook-not the one below but this is how I do it; not necessarily with seafood, but….  https://youtu.be/9wO8tqMVUn8
Ewwww the egg is raw 😱🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Don’t eat ramen!!!
Shin ramyun with a slice of american cheese added is really good too.
I'd drop an egg while the soup was boiling in a pan. Sooooo I've been knowing about egg with ramen since i was a teen, Now I'm 27.
My dad always drops an egg in his ramen, and I think it's gross! I would always wince, and he would just shake his head and say "MANN, THAT'S GOOD EATIN' !!!!" It HAS to be good though, because so many people do it!
You are a pro chef but use scissors to cut your green onions
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
EW.
why mayo?
Ah yes my favorite other than Indomie "shin ramyun"
신라면이라니 좀 치네
I wish I could eat ramen😞😞😞 but advised not to buy my doctor
Gross
I would probably add more spice
Chinese tiktok 11111
This is my favorite ramen bought a whole pack from Costco and it’s almost gone😂
Bing
Hi, i always watch your video's but in this vid you can't put the water that is use to cook the noodles because it has borax on it
Just buy Mama Tom yam Noodles  Delicious coconut broth with garliclemongrass packet included.
Ooo my goddie aunt, i rlly like her voice her voice is enviable. i wish i had voice like lisaaa <3 LOL.
Ew
I just tried it but my eggs....cooked??? 💀💀💀
I love shin ramen with Kewpie and cheese, it’s like heaven on earth 10/10 will eat it at least once a week
But its fookin raw
I don't remember the creator 🤔
I no
I just tryed this recipe... And man I just gotta say its awesome! The broth is really rich but in a good way and really tasty! I might used a little too much garlic but...damn Im gonna make my ramen this way from now on
i saw it in a funny short by jeenie weenie and immediately tried it. I'm on rhe older side of life with well established cooking habits but I am NEVER going back to my previous ramen / ramyun ways.
Is it actually good? it looks sorta good, but the mayo in it...?
I just made it for me and my mom a second ago eating it now lol, it’s actually good :)!
Just tried this and it's still spicy but really good
is it safe to eat eggs raw i know in japan its safe but where do you get yours?
Cool but I would never touch that. I have problem with raw egg getting on my fingers. I couldn't allow raw egg pass through my throat. We Africans( Ghana) like our food cooked like cooked cooked except for Ethiopia where they eat raw meat.
Just so that everyone knows you must be careful with the egg bit as if the egg is not cooked you will be poisoned
Didn’t realize this was a “TikTok hack”. I did this on my own. It is good.
This isn't even a hack. Have you never been to a ramen shop.
Dont bother with all that. Just add a slice of Kraft cheese. Makes it better and creamy.
I do this since I was young lol, without the mayo
Yummy 🤤
I tried searching for your channel to subscribe. I searched for "ramen noodles lady" and it got me to this video 😂😂. Subscribed lisa!
I have made this, and I now have it when I don’t know what to eat.  I also have started experimenting with adding more stuff. Like taiwanese spinach, Bok choy, Napa cabbage, pieces of pork.  It’s always delicious
I put a half a spoon of knorr sazon bouillon on my shin noodles. It makes it taste very good.
your nose sounds blocked
We use. Slice of velvets cheese instead of the Mayo! It is delicious too!
We always add egg to our noodles in the Philippines. Always makes it taste and look better 🥰
Looks disgusting
That is DISGOASTING
Rank !!
id rather eat ramen just from a bowl normally but everyone has their choices
Salmonella: allow us to introduce ourselves
😇
V also mentioned shin Ramen in her recent v live
Just add cheese it will taste the same instead of eating raw egg
He who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, ‘From his innermost being will flow rivers of living water.’ ” John 7:38 NASB1995
You drinking egg
I just put cheese in it
What’s this prison recipes how to make noodles
U can also add some cheese .makes it creamy and so good..
Yum
I've done this before with some Ramens and even add a slice of cheese sometimes. If you don't like spicy ramen I can suggest buying a different ramen? These are my fav noodles and it sucked so bad when they were gone bc they went "viral".
Does this really cook the egg though ?
omg no raw egg
Too bad I hate Mayo.
This is that type of heck that went viral and then forgotten and then viral and then forgotten. In my country I still remember 7 years ago, this went crazy haha
Note : to eat an raw egg ypu need a world class certified egg like in the japan standard, because japan itself put the standard so high to keep the culture of eating raw eggs
Jumped out of bed and am making this right now!
Does any mayo work okay?
Try putting a few tablespoons of Ranch. Game changer!!
Amazing
🤢
I did this. Got food poisoning. The egg was still raw.
can’t fault the technique.  mayo could have been held back until all the steps were done though.  not really necessary.  same for the egg.
Is that raw egg?
Try this. Cut fresh beef into fine slices.  Cut carrots, onions and garlic to very fine stripes. Fry it all in the Pan. Meanwhile Cook some water to pour it into the bowl with your instant noodles cover it with a plate and wait 5 min. Meanwhile boil eggs for exactly 7 min.( egg will be runny in the middle). And all your ingridiens into the bowl. Better than this sht
Low is as
Salmonela: 👁👄👁
OH HELL NAWH DAFUQ IS THAT
Me and my dad eat that brand of ramen it's sooo yummy !!!!!!! I eat it all the time I have to pace my self or I'll eat it till I look like im crying it's so spicy ! But so good !!!
Or just get a pack of creamy chicken flavored ramen noodles 😂😂
College students love her find out how this one girl made cup noodles feel like a real meal!
If the hot water cooked the egg then wouldn’t the egg come out like a scrambled egg? I don’t see any scrambled egg in that broth! Hmm
You can't find the originator because this "hack" probably came up not too long after shin ramyun were made
RAW
Interesting
That’s how I cook my noodles at work but with the hot water then in the microwave for 35 seconds to get the uncooked eggs fully cook usually in clumps if I cook at my truck it’s the same style as you have done. I also pan sear elk medaling rice 🍙 ball from home and pan sear vegetables. Next time I’ll video and share- also cook salmon/ trout at my truck same way when fishing with my daughters or father in law 🤙🏾
My favorite  Ramen brand is MAMA and my favorite  flavor  is Shrimp Tom Yum. So good 👍
You can add the egg in over top the noodles after you pour the hot water in too and then mixe in the seasoning packs for the same result. And it's a lot quicker. I've been doing  it for years, I like the flavor and texture  it adds to the sauce plus it gives you some protein. I like to use 2 eggs.
I'm not sure I'm comfy believing the egg will really be cooked enough
I know this very exact noodle i used to find it way too hot i never was able to finish it but now i can i've been working on improving my resistemce
Anyone else dying after eating these?  Nope just me, aight.
Also try adding some cheese too! Goes well with the egg.
if the eggs are not cooked, there will be salmonella in there.
🍜🍜🍜🍜
I NEED TO TRY THIS!
I just hope the egg cooks well like that
That looks delicious 🤤
Pake indomie bisa? 0
And yet restaurants have the nerve to charge on average $15 for a ramen bowl 🍜 🙅🏻‍♂️
What. This is all I did in prison
Hack originator- Japanese people in the 50s when instant ramen was created
I do this except I mix everything then throw in the Microwave.
What kind of Mayo? Is she just saying a brand?  Thanks
I’m pretty sure this isn’t a new hack, people have been doing this for over 30 years that I can remember.
Shin ramen I used btw
I used the beef and bone marrow flavor ramen
Looks jumm but don't want to test salmonella
Im so curious does this taste like tonkotsu ? It looks like it and i love tonkotsu but im kind of a picky eater and im scared i wont like it once i make it :/
What kind of Mayo was used?
Wssh the noodles to remove the noodles' covering. Dont use the first boil.
hasnt gloom tried this
Salmonella? Nice hack
A Vietnamese guy name Long created this in prison back 2002
I allways put an egg in it and add a one of those cup soup and it tastes amazing
Just made it Edit:This is delicious
She is a Noodle Queen 👑
Would it work with the Samyang fire noodles?
I just tried this with non-spicy instant ramen, but I added some sriracha to the mixture at the beginning!
We have some Japanese mayo....now i wanna try this tomorrow with my fiance
So I’m eating this rn. It tastes so good but I wish I didn’t know it’s contents 😭
I'm gonna try to make the recipe
What kind of mayo?
Ohhh y’all want salmonella huh? 😷
The thing that’s sad about YT shorts is you can’t “save” this or bookmark 😩 will def try this.
I boil half the season and put the rest in when Im done. That pack is 2,000mg of salt, for avid ramen eaters 🦍 Id boil to dilute the salt.
Back in collage, I add cheddar to my ramen 🤣along with exactly this ingredients
Or, just boil the noodle and broth together. That's what I always do
Raw egg = no thx
That egg is still raw 🤮🤮🤮
This seems good but mayo gives me nausea and i hate raw egg the taste
I might try this lol, personally I enjoy the spice of the shin ramyun but that’s just me lol
Why isn’t it turning eggy?
Too much work will not do it
It looks like raw... I mean the egg
I put the egg into the hot soup and let it rest. The white gets cooked a bit, so when I stir it the yolk dissolves in the soup and white float in pieces.
Something I have been doing for a while now with my instant ramen noodles is I've been adding garlic aioli. It is very tasty and very easy to add a bunch of flavor.
Are you always sick?
Scrambled eggs, sliced jalapeños, mayo, garlic, some diced bacon and melted cheese mixed in with the ramen is sooo much better in my opinion 👌
Not a hack
Not people doing this since ramen were originated 💀💀
I always crack the raw egg into the finished noodles. You filthy casual!🥚🍜
Nah actually, I put the water than the noodle, spices and after its a little cook, I'll put eggs or other toppings and mix it so it's well served and still hot. But sure. This works too
does the egg get cooled by the boiling water? because I think other than that a raw egg might be unhealthy
Ur noodles be soogy after u messing with it for so long, this is tiktok kind of stupid
Garlic and mayo
Ewww
Every ramen video makes me so dang hungry
I think the original creator of this ramen hack was Beryl Shereshewsky.
What self respecting Asian is putting mayonnaise in their freaking Ramen??!!! 🤢
Theres wax on the packaged ramen which can cause cancer, its better for your health to drain the cooked noodles and just use hot water ❤️ im a cancer patient stay healthy everyone! Love you
An Asian lady I worked with laughed at me and said you aren’t supposed to dump the whole spice packet in
I’ve been making this for years. I thought I made this up, lol no joke.  So yummmmmmmmmmmm
That looks so good! I can’t wait to try it 😊
I know this originally from EmmymadeinJapan or Emmymade.
I think I’ll stick to my instant noodles
Ok I’m going to by all of those and make it
People rediscovering cooking and thinking it counts as "hacking" lol
That ramen isn’t spicy
I like the spice but this still looks good
I love mixing stuff to MAMA ramen
Cook the ramen as instructed, remove from heat after it cooks. Immediately put the soup into a bowl and crack an egg and mix it.
My grandma and mom like to cook something like this but after we put it in the egg mixed with seasoning we fried it so it’s like a noodle omelette
No :( why did i just saw this now :') i just finished eating the whole pack of ramdn, dam itt
What kind of Mayo?
Egg in ramen is the best I have been doing this since I was a child ☺️
Raw egg white? Bleh..
How does the raw water egg taste 😭😭?
U tries spoce tolerance but than also u fell that shin ramyun is spicy buttttttt i should say that u r blessed with your digestive system.
Why you always eat hot food .
We usually have the cup noodle nissin seafood ramen, we just add the raw egg and add hot boiling water. My sibs add togarashi.
the color looks the same as when I add milk
Don't eat raw eggs as per my knowledge only japanese eggs are safe enough to be eaten raw...Ramen looks cool tho🤤
Looks disgusting
Mm yes I'd love some salmonella with my noodles 😍🤮
So a raw egg with noodles yumm
Big nope! I hate raw egg and that shim ramyun is not spicy and salty for me
Don't try this I got so sick
Bruh I don’t know about adding the ramen broth into the mix, I swear there’s heaps of preservative and MSG in the water that is used to cook the ramen. I always tip it out
I prefer popping a sunny side fried egg on top
I've been adding an egg to my ramen for years but it had never occurred to me to add mayo... I am not a huge mayo fan so I'm not sure I trust it.
This is so clever!
I need to start trying new types of ramen! The ones I eat regularly I usually add loads of spice and it’d probably taste better from a designated package rather than the random blend of spices I add at random 😂
Well this just made my next at home dinner date plans interesting~
Um... it’s easier to mix the egg etc into the boiling water...(w/noodles) then pour the whole thing into a bowl and top with green onions. If spice isn’t a problem, throw some kimchi in there too 🤷🏼‍♀️
Since I hate mayo I may try this using coconut milk instead 🤔
I literally have all of these things so I’m gonna try this tonight
Egg in ramen really isn't a hack. It's pretty typical for ramen.
It was me. I invented this
Also if its way to spicy you can do this without the garlic and have some icewater and you should be good!
So there went the convenience of Ramen noodles
I got the black bag version and it's sooooo spicy so I'm definitely trying this so I don't waste it hahaha thank you !
Salmonella has entered the chat
What can someone who doesn’t like mayo replace it with?
Shin cups are legendary
Won't you get poisoned from drinking that soup since it's y'know, a raw egg? 😀
Tried it, so good!
It look delicious
Add cheese to it
Ewww
salmonella incoming
Am I the only one that crushes the noodles up before I make them
So Raw egg????🤢
This is one of the only ways I cook instant noodles lol
I’ve actually always do this with my ramen I didn’t think anybody else did this
I would recommend boiling a new pot of water t9nadd to the mix. That first pot is full of chemical perservatives and waxes which are bad for digestion.
So recipes are "hacks" now?
Made this and it’s fantastic! 🍜 🥚
What do you mean by hack? What is the hack? This is called a recipe.
stuffy nose ahhhh girl
MAYO?? That is disgusting.
Works well with Neoguri ramyun too! Add creamed corn.
If you say that Shin ramen noodles are too spicy, I can't trust you. You would sip water and have a stroke because there are too many calories.
This is nothing new.. It's called Simen
Mmm
Some what Mayo??? Someone help! Lol
BRO I LOVE RED SHIN RAYMUN, black shin best tho
I honestly just slap a cheese slice on it and pour soup over to make it melt and it's yummy
...the egg is fully cooked? How do you know.
Too spicy?
:Pepecross:
At first I was quite doubtful about it but DAMN THIS TASTES AMAZING
Question, what is the purpose of cooking the egg? Does it change the consistency or something?
You mean i have to keep the eggs raw like that mega pass from me
Ugh there's nothing healthy about this recipe
Wanna eat less spicy ramen go find something less spicy stop making things disgusting
I feel like you can get a similar look and possibly taste from just adding garlic powder, a cheese slice, and an egg boiling on top like usual lol.
I’m sorry, I’m new to cooking, what type of mayo did she use??
🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
HAHA A NEW WAY TO HAVE CRACKHEAD SOUP
I need to try this! Actually I eat my instant noodles adding lemon juice, soy and chilli sauce, this combination is sooo good
Friend came
@missbarpanda  also shared the same recipe 🤣
i’ve done similar but with cream cheese instead of mayo but also adding sriacha
Her voice annoying
Adding egg to ramen is not a "new hack". That is some classic ramen shit.
This is not new. Your average H-K student done this since forever.
Shin ramyun black is soooooo good with soft boiled quail eggs. Perfect lil bites of goodness, like each one pops in your mouth...mmmmmmmm
I would actually try this hack but I hate eggs a lot but if I was a egg lover I would eat it very often lol
Lol trend is gone and I don’t know why I am trying until now… but I didn’t remove broth because I’m lazy lol you are genius
„Hack.“ In my time, they called this a recipe. I’ll see myself out.
🤧🤧🤧
You have to add in corned beef next time (only ox palm) and a side of rice. Heavy breakfast.
Instant ramen looks so cheap
I strongly advice people to not eat this noddles seasoning... It's full of chemical products...  Make your own seasoning. 😊
Raw eggs... Yuck
Way to ruin your food.
Atleast you can enjoy your ramen before you die of  diarrhea and vomiting from the salmonella. 😌
That ain’t even an Appetizer not even  a even a sample
Raw egg :0
Is that raw egg tho?
Shin ramen is spicy? Really? Genuinely I am surprised people think that.
Looks delicious 😋 😍
I can't handle spicy. I would like to try this
I really love to add some cheese to my ramen, it makes the broth creamy and delicious
What mayo?
In indonesia. We call this intel
do you have a cold ?
I usually drain the boiled ramen water away because that's the stuff that contains the excess oils and preservatives.   Rinse the ramen in cold filtered water and get new hot water into the bowl after dumping the cold water and add the seasoning.   Just me?
Yes! Mayonnaise with my ramen, I've had 2 outcomes. Sometimes it will taste like Alfredo or with the right spices and its a creamy spicy blissful taste.
did that with cup noodle.. think that i did it wrong ..
commenting for later lmao
Raw egg, ew no
What kind of mayo?
It looks 🤕
How is this a hack? It’s literally just an ordinary recipe
Amm OK but not cooked egg 😐
Interesting 😋
ew
I live in The States and we only have crappy ramen here in the South. We only get the seasoning package not the other package with all the good stuff in it. I'm mad about it.
Hey it kinda looks like the food at a fancy restaurant :D
Yay. Raw chicken fetus ☹️
Telor nya belom Mateng
Best part is you temper the egg
The originator is probably some anonymous college student
I've been mixing eggs into my instant noodles for years 👀
This is not new at all. It's older that social media.
I gotta try this but I’ll use the Shin Black noodles. Those are my favorite.
I dont think I've ever had Ramen I liked. It all tastes terrible everytime I will myself to eat it. But because I love pho youtube thinks I must love Ramen.
Add a slice of kraft American cheese. You’ll thank me later
This is viral? Lol been doing this since 2012
I gotta do this! I usually put an egg into my ramen at the end, egg drop soup style.
Simmer the water and pour sauce/egg mix in slow and waaalaaa egg drop... yummy creation
I think I'm going to throw up 🤢
Everytime I watch this channel, it makes me hungry
So you mean to tell me I've been mixing egg yolk into my ramen the hard way all this time? Good job to me for making things complicated, you just made life easier!!! Not even being sarcastic, i did things the hard way for so long.
Looka good but I'm not in for the raw egg.
For any instant ramen and cup-a-noodles, add lots of Old Bay garlic and herb seasoning. It elevates everything 2 levels. Pass the word!!! Tell your grocer!
So, it's a Ramen Carbonara?
How is this a hack…..
Finally a hack that actually works and doesn't trick people.
It’s not a “hack”, Asian have done this since the beginning.
That actually looks good
You could even make a dashi while cooking the noodles by adding kombu and bonito flakes to the water or by making a shoyu  miso tare with dashi miso and soy sauce just a thought I think it would bring it to the next level
I think it would be even better with Japanese mayo because the flavor profile is different from regular mayo and might compliment the flavor of the ramen better
I just poor boiling water into the noodles, drop an egg on it and mix lol, so much effort
I love watching you tool bags eating microwaveable Ramen with chopsticks. It's the equivalent of a nice seasoning over a TV dinner. 😂
additional ingredients and change in prep is not a “hack”. anyway, looks interesting, might try…
We use cheese instead of kewpie mayo.
I gotta save up and buy some eggs, but I gotta try this. Oh, and save up to buy the Ramen, and the mayo and...
*laughs in egg intolerance/allergy*
STTOOAAWWWPPPP ITS 1.52 AM😮‍💨😩😩😩😩
Gen a Learning something from there big brother and calling it a hack
Me who is too squeamish about raw egg 🤢😖
Day 2 of asking Lisa to try the hottest noodles she can find
I do it with peanut butter
The word “hack” has really lost its meaning
Me who never knew it-
Do you want salmonella? Because this is how you get salmonella.
Lisa please make naans
For those who think shin ramyun is too spicy - remove the red chili flakes from the packet of dried toppings. I find it helps a lot.
People called me weird and crazy for years but now that it's a viral trend it's delicious 🙄 . Put maple syrup on your ramen. ..I sound crazy now but just you wait till it trends.
So cool!!
I thought this was common since my mom taught me this since when i was a child back then.
Salmonella instant xD
I sometimes put an egg in my noodles. However I don't put mayo in it.
Mayo???
Too spicy? People think packaged ramen is too spicy?
What happened in the morning  I s what I want to know mayo shouldn't be eaten warm but definitely  looks good
Raw egg should have added it thirds end for light cooking
I like to throw in chicken and an egg or two
Next level: Add cheese.
Send me the recipe
But it's raw eggs?
That’s not a hack, that’s a real-deal recipie!
Salmonella
I put mayo in my ramen in prison
People have to learn what ”hack” actually means… this is a recipe, a lazy one but still just a recipe, you are not ”hacking” anything.
My mom used to put egg in her ramen way back, before Internet even, here in Brazil, but she did this to make it more nutritious, since they didn't have much money and ramen is very cheap. Since I never liked eggs, I never tried this, but it's fun to watch it now as a hack.
Why do you always sound like you're congested?
I've been doing this for years I even ad d more hot sauce to it ,it's delicious I've never tried it with mayonnaise though...
damn you egg allergies this looks so good
I do this but I mix my mixture in while the noodles are cooking I’m scared of that raw egg
🤦🏿‍♂️
I too find Shin Ramyun a tad bit spicy. I just add cheese, and it brings in the cloudy effect and mellows down the heat. Used to use eggs, but prefer cheese. Also after have Soon Ramyun, a milder, version, have briefly taken a break from Shin Ramyun. Also I didn't know this was a hack
Sooooo raw egg?
I still just eat plain ol chicken flavor and I love it. Never tried any fancy ramen
it looks the color of adrenachrome yous are all brainwashed!!
How tf is this a hack? Literally add everything to one single pot and beat the egg while it's boiling, then add Mayo to taste.
I guess I'm basic. I just put the egg in with the ramen and broth - no mixing, no mayo. Just poached.
You gonna tell me that egg was actually cooked and not still raw?
Shin isn't spicy, actually its even milder in the US. Also throw the noodles out and use rice instead, ramen is way better with rice.
Gross
It's called a recipe not a hack
I feel like the mayo would make it worse than just eating it as is.
I might give this a try sometime... not sure when tho.
Why would we do something to make it less spicy
Alternatively you can also just mix mayo into the soup/noodles, season to your preference and voila! Bomb
Disgusting as hell
Welp I’m craving ramen now
Not a big ramen fan but this looks good
Indomine is still best
You drop the egg(s) in when u boil your noodles so you get like egg drop soup texture
Ewwwww
Disgusting...egg is still raw
Been doing this with my shin ramyun noodles for years. Mayo.  When I would suggest it to people they’d do a stank face.
No way, add the egg to the boiling water.  U ate a heated up raw egg dood.
Mayo is nasty
What does the egg do?
Gross
I'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR A DECADE
Calls it a "ramen hack" yet this is one of many TYPICAL ways it's made by Koreans. Very common, not a hack at all. Just uneducated about Korean cuisine
And if I use Naoguri noodles, I replace the mayo and garlic with some sour cream.  It's amazing.
I generally boil my veggie packet with my noodles so they soften properly, then, when the noodles are nearly done, I add my egg to the noodle pot and poach it so the whites get cooked but the yolk is runny.  It adds some texture to the ramyun.  Everything else I do as instructed. ^-^
Hi
Never use the water that you first boil with as it contains all the wax that covers it, don’t believe me go ahead and boil any packet ramen and pour the ramen out into a sieve and look around the sides of the pot you just boiled it with and you will be surprised.
Tonkotsu ramen Costco is better tbh
if i dont want to mellow the spice, can i use anything other than mayo?
Woow
Watching this just makes me hungry🥲
But.. it's raw egg 😓
Shin ramen with Jimmys Sate Sauce as well as full cream milk (replacing the water after boiling) 😎
Do you have a cold? Lol sure sounds like it
That take more time if you are late..
MSG
Ewww
I- I tried this today, and it basically changed my life. I was actually expecting it to taste nasty for some reason? Because I usually don't eat eggs this way. But I- was so wrong 😭
If u keep it the spicy way it might help to clear your nose.
i cant get behind eating liquidy egg, even tho this looks bomb asf
But what's the egg for?
Disgusting!!
Just use American cheese like a normal Korean.
Yummmmm
Wait…so this makes it LESS spicy? Guess I’ll skip the mayo. I always need to *add* spice to mine. 🥵😋
You are suppose to boil the noodles in the seasoned water so the noodles will soak up the flavor as they cook.  This way, the noodles are flavorless.  Adding mayo is just gross!
I love Ramen
What is qp mayo
Love it, but can it work without mayo? I truly can’t stand it and I wonder if this would function without it~
This is a hack? This is just how I survived one of the poorest stages of my life, figuring the egg added protein and the mayo added calories.... Oh, yeah, it tastes good too
I just bought this ramen today for the first time in months, I'm definitely having a midnight snack.
Does anyone have some suggested measurements for the added ingredients? I’m bad at “guesstimating”
Never save the noodle water. Always discard the starchy noodle water because it also has wax in it from the noodles believe it or not. Rinse the noodles off, and heat new clean water. It's a world of difference, and much healthier. That's also how they do it in Japan.
John 3 16 for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life
Kinda looks a little bit like char kuetiaw
The problem is I don't use the water I do it dry so
The problem is I don't use the water I do it dry so
Can we stop calling dumb shit like this “a hack”
Blow your nose
Mmmmm Noodles 🤤
I like to cook the noodels strain them away from water then add the spice. Its very hot but man is it delicious
You can add raw egg?
Can I do this with Maggi?
Eh, I'm too lazy to make something of the same quality tasty-wise spending like 3 times the amount of time than usually. Good video tho, I have nothing against the idea.
Is this actually good?
Your suppose to just do the egg yolk
Can only focus on how you sound like you have a cold
That's my favorite ramen 😍😍 spicy but well worth the spice.
But RaW egg !?
The is not a hack. It is just cooking
I put sour cream and a soft boiled egg split in half with pepper on the egg slightly
Yes, also while I was Korea alot of times they would put a slice of America cheese on top while it was hot and then you'd mix it in, it was so good and would help with the spiciness
It was too spicy! Crazy spicy.
U can actually do this was easier if u Just put the egg into the noodle water and Mix it around with Ur chopsticks😅
You cooked and ate an entire shrimp - tail included. You’re telling us about cooking??
Me: Wow! Another video of cooking my fav ramen After a while: using raw egg 🥚 Me, my brain and my mind: 🤯🌋💀
My gag reaction could never 🤪  my brain would keep telling me it's a raw egg
Gonna try it with red chile instead of mayo..should cure my sinus infection
I'd do it without the egg in it I don't like egg in there like that I feel like I'm eating raw egg 😅
then you get a stringy clear egg white in your mouth LULW
Uncle Rodger would be sad
no
Raw egg... ewww salmonella
Shin ramen 🥶
this isnt a hack its a recipe
What’s that mayo called again???
Salmonella.
May as well eat a spread
This is literally the best ramen pack
Me watching this wondering if we have eggs in the fridge:
Oh hm. *saves this for a hungry day*
Your voice sounds like you always have a stuffy nose, awful.awful
Raw egg
Take your desired amount of raman or at least 2 packs add 1 can of Campbell's or Progresso 1 can of Cream of mushrooms or whatever you like add shredded cheese black pepper and chopped green onions it's amazing and filling
Better with cheese.
Bro wtf is just a recipe not a hack 😭
What do you mean “until most of the seasoning has dissolved into the egg”? I don’t think maybe seasonings (other than sugar or salt) can even dissolve in water
I like hot and spicy Roman  noodles  with shrimp and add some kimchi👍🏻
The best way to scramble eggs is similar.  Beat your eggs as usual. As a little butter and heavy cream. Milk works, I guess. But heavy cream is best.  Put in a sauce pan and heat on medium heat. As the eggs start to SLOWLY cook, remove from heat and continually stir vigorously. Never stop stirring and remove from the heat often. As soon as you see the egg chunking up from the heat, remove and stir, stir, stir.  This is the key to having creamy, spreadable eggs for toast or a bagel. Likewise, I would assume you could stir in a packet or ramen seasoning, add the cooked noodles and a little bit of the hot water to thin things out and you would have creamy ramen.  But I don't eat that shit anymore so I really don't know.
Never seen this but it looks good.
Too spicy? Have you tried the 2x spicy Korean ramen? My whole body tingles until I have a fully blown out of body experience. It’s also delicious. 10/10 recommend.
the egg is raw
This was pretty good!
Me: *searches "ramen" in yt before sleeping*   Me again: now I'm hungry 😩😩
Raw egg, uncooked tastemaker and boiled noodles... Yukk
Don't make a habit of eating this. Not good for your kidneys especially.
It’s an annoying day for me, I forgot to buy myself some ramen 😢 😅
And here I'm thinking she's basically drinking raw egg. I'd probably pop it on the stove for some minutes. I dont think I could handle that taste of raw eggs.
Not really a hack, it's just adding ingredients to make instant noodles look and taste like real soup. I used to do this all the time with Samyang noodles, but would use beef as well.
Great way to get food poisoning.  Seriously  ?
If anyone wanna make sure it’s fully cooked, I often just plop it into the microwave for 10s and do that 3 times. Just to make sure cuz I don’t have a strong stomach 🥲
Im sure I do ir way better and also clean the noodles after they heat and remove preservatives as much as I could when heating
Too spicy??
Holy cow that's a lot of sodium.
Add egg and a little egg and a tiny bit of oil. 🤷‍♂️
My favorite way is add an egg. I have got to get some of that mayo tho!!
Shin ramen noodles are not even that spicy compared to Buldak 2x spice
Eh gross, even if I wasn't allergic to eggs I would not want mayonnaise to be hot 🤨
🤤
Forget the mayo. Add fake cheese slice or whatever cheese instead if you must.
Oh nah we not breezing past how she just cut up the onion with scissors.
Salmonella
This is what we are all going to be eating thanks to the Brandon economy.
Boil water in a tea kettle than pour in and cover mixture. Dont boil ramen.
YUM!  That’s looks delicious!
I highly doubt the egg is fully cooked. Sorry but- big ewww...
Why is it that I see Angelina Jolie's face and a surgeon's face when I clicked on this video I thought it was about them 🤣.
Hmm, looks good
This looks like my diarrhea.
Personally I prefer to drain my noodles and combine the spice pack with a drizzle of sesame oil, oyster sauce or fish sauce, a dash of soy and a few drops of hot sauce, mix it all together with the ramen. Also sometimes topping with a bit of chili mayo
Will the egg get you sick because its not fully cooked?
The Shin ramen is not too spicy, I absolutely love it. But I will definitely try this!
Nice way to add protein
This can be done with any ramen? And dose it have to be that mayo
Final product looks like Shin Black.
I didn’t have all the ingredients, but found an alternate way to make it creamy and delicious 😋       Subsitutes:  eggs- I’m out of eggs, so I just skipped it.  Spicy ramen- regular chicken flavored ramen Chives- used parsley instead Extra flavor: Curry I used REAL Mayo, NOT miracle whip  Follow the video’s instructions. It will thicken without the egg and it’s soooooo tasty!
.
Looks good, but l like my eggs cooked
Not really a hack, more of a recipe..
I use sour cream instead of mayo and also add avocado.  Not traditional, but it’s sooo yummy!
Raw egg is a big nono. Someone may argue you are cooking It by pouring hot water in, but as soon as you pour It, is no longer boiling. Salmonella is quite terrible so.... NOPE
The egg is still raw. Not sure I want to eat that. Doesn’t look appealing in the least.
Im 30 from russia and we've been eating noodles this way since i remember eating them)
It's similar to how it's made carbonara
Don’t know how people eat chicken periods. Disgusting
Foood
Good
So you added egg and mayo to instant ramen. Congrats...
Y'all consider noodle recipes a "hack"? Lls 🤣 man you'd be blown away in a federal prison
Im definitely going to try this !! 🤤
No I usually put ranch and chicken flavorin with butter and cheese.
Wait you wanted it less spicy?
Definitely not a cooked egg
This looks so bad :/
Bruh your doing it wrong, are you even asian?
I can't convince myself that the egg is cooked
Instant noodles isn’t healthy
Just add cheese and it's the same
im worried about the egg not getting cooked enough, is it safe?
How can I tell if the egg is raw or cooked.  Gordon Ramsay?
Its just tempering an egg. Just like custard. Qp is gross too. But each to their own. This makes sense despite my comments.
Ramen noodles are like the duct tape of food. It’s an extremely versatile food product. You can eat it raw and uncooked right out of the pack(I’ve done this many times) or you can make it into a gourmet meal.
The only egg going in Ramen is a cured soft boiled egg, hold the mayo
For anyone watching, I highly recommend Shin Ramen, to anyone who LOVES noodles. The best Shin, is probably the Shin Black. It's a bone broth soup, with garlic, and it is delicious.
Lisa I Created this hack 🤣
Ugh people always make ramen look so good and I want to eat it but I know how bad it is for you 😩
egg is uncooked though 😖. I m pregnant. Can’t do this 😵‍💫
I think it's kinda gross
I did this all my life (except for putting some mayo) . I'm surprised it's a "hack" 😳
Just like egg drop soup if you had that it’s probably boiled . Yum 😋
Dried veggies should go with the ramen intead quick shower in hot water
Who made this? Japan.
Yuck
Mmmm… sodium.
What kind of mayo?
a mayo is basically an egg
I do this with maggi Kari noodles.  Delicious! ♡
Well I tried your Roman noodle hack and that was pretty good you should make With some different other romanoes
Isn’t ramen the stuff you fix your broken porcelain sink with? And you wonder why 2/3’s of people are obese
If u don't like raw egg in your Ramen, use queso cheese to get this consistency and taste.
This is the most complicated way of adding an egg I've ever seen.
My son loves this hack 😁 has been trying to get me to try it for weeks. Looks good 😊
I've added egg to my ramen for years and now it's a trend. It's good and adding extra seasonings as well I like to add some chili powder on top to give a little kick
im sorry but the raw egg 😬
You’re not supposed to use the noodle water in ramen
Yum raw eggs. Jk that's gross.
but then like……. your ramen is lukewarm
Any substitute for egg?🤔
Korean people often add raw egg to a lot of their foods and they also make dipping sauces with raw egg. I’m not very fond of the taste and texture but it’s alright
Oh wow, I thought that was a common thing. I do this to literally every ramen I make.
Ewwww
me who has an egg allergy
BUT THE EGG-
But egg was raw🤨
I just don't understand the ramen love in US...yes we have it here too...usually college kids eat it in dorms or low income ppl....but instead of tryng this hack how about cooking a soup 🤔 from scratch with fresh ingredients 😐
That looks absolutely disgusting
i made this yesterday and the algorithm shows me this video??
This is stupid. We Malaysians just threw them all in the pot, its the same thing, way long before viral exist.
Raw egg... Yah hard pass ugh..
Who cares if the egg isn't cooked? Just don't live in a country where they can be dangerous. Simple! :)
this is nothing new, asian college students been doing these for like, since instant ramen is available
This isn't a "hack". You're not reverse engineering the ramen to do something other than what it was intended to do... This is called "following a recipe"... I know! Ground-breaking stuff.
People worried about the egg being raw, but I'm worried about that dried vegetable mix not cooked.
That egg is 100% raw 🤢
People here unsure if the egg is cooked meanwhile I eat my eggs raw
Add some crushed chips and you got yourself a prison style spread on your hands....
Not really feeln tha mayo part....🤢🤢🤢 but, tha rest looks bomb! ✌🏽😁❤👉🏽💣🍜
Uncle Roger say "no hack for ramen, hai-yaa 🤦‍♂️"
Wow too lazy smh
Simply put a slice of kraft singles cheese
I’m allergic to every instant ramen on the market. It’s the MSG. If there is any instant ramen flavor without MSG that is on the market that is affordable, i would love to know about it.
Eh ill try it without the mayo. Papa needs that spice
Solid snake did it first
That water was hardly even steaming when it was poured... If that bowl and the egg were cold, no way the small amount of hot water fully cooked the egg. I hope it was pasteurized. I use this method for ramen but I make sure my water is piping hot and I use a larger volume to ensure the egg is cooked through
Shin is by far one of the best ramen I'd say
Do it properly: soft/medium boil the egg in advance and marinade it in soy and water like the Japanese do for 24 or 48 hours.
I've been making my ramen similarly to this for decades but I use a small pat of butter instead of mayo. Adds a wonderful creaminess to it! Glad to see others trying it, it's delicious.
Finally, an internet challenge that doesn't involve a hospital visit
Yep egg was 50% cooked but u still can smell raw egg for me its good but for other idk @_@?
Been doing this for years, it’s delicious
Yeah late, my mom did this for 15 years
Ha i just crack an egg and eat the crumbs. This hack is a L0T better
I don't like egg that much but I'd marry you
So adding ingredients to a dish is called a hack now… FFS
This is gross the spices and egg mixture doesn't even look cooked. It's better to cook the seasonings with the noodles so that the flavour absorbs. Use salt for more taste  And just enough spices so that it is spicy as hell but doesn't ruin the noodles.
I did that in 1992
That look's delicious but the fact that the egg is raw i cant stand it.
Already do that lol only way to eat Ramen 😉 Mayo is king.
Too many extra steps, just make the "egg blend" and add it to the cooking noodles
I thought she's gonna turn that into pancake by mix cooked noodle to the mixture then pan fried it
As an avid ramen lover I'm surprised this went viral and Ive only just seen it, also is this a hack? Or is it just a different recipe? Always thought life hacks were about making things easier, this is just adding ingredients and cooking them slightly differently
I tried this and after eating it I went straight to the bathroom 🚽
I love the way you speak, it’s so clear and concise. I can listen to your recipes all day.
Add shredded cheese
This is amazing for ANY ramen! Great improvement!
She must be on a fix income why she eat noodles every dammn day lol
I'm out here eating 5 dollar dollar store ramen when she got that ramen that comes with small VEGTABLES and powder-
wayyy to much garlic for 1 bowl 😩
Looks yum!
Koreans been doing that for decades
when did COOKING become a "hack"?
I don’t think that egg is cooked all the way, no thanks
i know soft boiled eggs are common in ramen but I've always made a sunny side egg because I like breaking the yolk into the broth!!! def gonna try this
Never thought I'd learn something about the ramen flavor packs until now thank you for the tip 😺
Ramen hack to get salmonella...
Nah, just ate a cooked egg with herbal seasoning and added a bit of oat cream to the standard spice mixture.
Cool concept. I always add poached egg to my kimchi ramen and green onion!  I'm not a fan of mayo.
I’ve been doing this a long time but butter instead of mayo and add some soy sauce
No credits needed been doing that shut for twenty years…
You. Are. American. Obviously
Not the whole season pack, unessary.
…or just put some Kraft cheese in it😋
That looks great
How was the diarrhea?
Ngl kinda shook that she's using the same EXACT type of bowl that the restaurant i work at uses. Not that i don't know what mass production is but it's still wild to see it.
The only Hack I know is crunching the noodles inside of the bag then opening it putting in the seasoning and eating it as Chips
Raw egg....🤮🤮🤮
Skipped the mayo,  loved it thank you
We love salmonella ☺️🥰
Joe Bastianich would have been like ‘raw garlic?’
Im so late to ramen i just stopped microwaving my maruchan
Great idea!!  I usually do 'egg drop' ramen. Add an egg to the pot right after the noodles and give them a minute to poach.  It's a little messy when I strain it though, lots of little egg bits get wasted.
There’s a minute of my life I’m never getting back. ☹️ This is a case where it’s appropriate to invert the usual adage “better late than never” to “better never than late.” You really shouldn’t have bothered.
Kind of late to the party, but would not it be easier to just toss the egg in when the noodle almost done cooking? That way you ensure that the egg is fully cooked and the noodle absorbs the soup and egg flavor.
I never use that pre-minced garlic.
I luv it lol
I'm just satisfied that it's not only me who isn't comfortable with the egg...I mean I can't take it like the egg is actually cooked 😶
🤢🤮
I just crack two eggs and add any veggies
Vietnam fell to communism.
It could be even better with cheese
If you don't subscribe, I'll go live53times at 3 AM.
Ive put mayo in my noodles before
but why can’t you just pour the egg mixture onto water with the noodles on it while it’s still boiling?
🤢
Egg is not cooked! I throw my egg is the pot with seasoning as the last ingredients.
Lol that’s just the reverse of the original way to cook at. Adding mayo is just basically adding egg york and oil to it
You obviously don’t know what you’re talking about, and know nothing of saimin
I make the best saimin.. and it’s not a “hack”.. I’ve been doing that since I was 16.. I’m 27 now.. no one person discovered this “hack”.. people just do that
Its essentially a similar process that carbonara goes through.
I usually just strain the broth and add in hot sauce and Buffalo chicken.
Late but present 👍🏻
?????? Been doing this ever since I was a kid
You can make it creamy with America cheese
Raw egg soup I’m good can’t risk it
Honestly, looks horrible…
It looks like it wants to be tonkotsu ramen, but it is not tonkotsu ramen..
Nah the mayonnaise is too much
What is QP mayo??
yall know that egg is raw✋🏼🤢
Disgusting even without the egg.
Can i do it with cup of noodles? I microwave those al dente style, then i drain all the water and just eat the noodles, usually beef and shrimp
킹받네……….
Ramen hack?! More like, Ramen yack...GAH-ROSS!!
Egg will remain unboiled?? IDK.. we can’t eat raw eggs in India.. I may catch salmonella..
Can you make broth for the buldak 2x spicy ramen?
Did this chick just fucking cut green onions with scissors
Make it veg🥺
i tried this ramen one time but i didnt know what to add to make it better and i just ate it straight up and it was so spicy i thought i was going to die but this looks so tasty 😳
...and zero micronutrients
Dammit now I want ramen but I have no ramen :( OFF TO THE STORE, AWAY!! :)
I would try but I can't eat raw egg yolk sorry 😭
People worried about raw egg while I’m using raw egg as a “dipping sauce” for meat
I LOVE YOUR VOICE SO MUCHHHH😭😭😭😭😭😭
yummy salmonella
I came up with something similar on my own. Ill make ramen on the stove, as the water is about to boil you turn off the heat, drop and egg in and stir. You just have to have the preffered amout of water before you do.
You used like... half the noodles
She has a pleasant voice
I would substitute butter or cream for the mayo.
Looks like you added 4 dollars  in ingredients to an 89 cent bag of shit
You could just save time and crack the egg into the boiling water
Today I made my ramen ( that same brand) but I added more mushrooms cilantro and jalapeño slices at the end , I loved it.
Make sure the water is boiling when you pour it into the bowl, raw eggs can contain salmonella which poaching ie boiling in water will kill.
The lady at Walmart ® told us to strain the egg through our hand.
Plopped
No thanks egg is raw
.
Same brand I use and I still need to add spice. Looks good!
I've been doing my insta ramen this way for years! Except for the Mayo. I don't like  the Mayo taste on my ramen and the egg makes it creamy enough already.
I wish I could even eat shin ramyeon.... stupid food allergies...
What are we having for dinner today?  -Viral ramen hack #7
Why is a recipe a 'hack'?
Definitely trying this. I love this brand of ramen!
lisa ily so much omg I GIB CONDITIONAL LOVE, tysm for these vids, they make me feel so happy ( ꈍᴗꈍ)
I buy the bowl ones and I put a small spoon of Caesar dressing and it’s amazing
Just tried this and now I have diarrhea. I might not have boiled the egg long enough 😭
Wait you have to put in the water- 😫
🤮
Looks delicious! And that is one of our favorite brands of ramen. Now I'm wanting this and a cold lychee ramune for dinner tonight 😋
I'm gonna have to try this one. My favorite is to sauté garlic, onions, ginger, and mushrooms in butter directly in my ramen pot, deglazing 2 to 3 times with a mixture of soy sauce, mirin, sherry, and brown mustard (just a dab or so). Then I add my water and seasoning, bring it to a boil and add my noodles if I'm using packaged ramen. While that's going I beat an egg or three into submission, and when the noodles are almost done I stir the pot briskly and add the thinnest drips of egg that I can, continuously stirring in a circle, so that each drip threads out and cooks almost instantly (like egg drop soup but with the yolks, too), then I serve it up garnished with some green onions and chashu. I prefer to make the noodles from scratch and keep a large pot of broth boiling, adding egg and noodles for each serving as I go, because it tastes better, but the downside is I have to stay in the kitchen serving the kids, so I'm thinking about trying a hot pot style, if I can find something big/safe/affordable enough.
The noodles are made from egg as well  So is Mayo  You just ate bunch of egg
now I'm hungry
My daughters cook ramen per directions, drain and then use milk with the flavor packet. I haven’t tried it….
Hack LOL. I have been doing this for 20 years.
Raw egg?
This has been around for ages, the garlic is pleasantly good, also cook the egg more to be safe…
This is like that episode of nose dive. Sickening
I might try this right ducking 🦆 now
Another good way to make it creamy with way less work is replacing half the water with milk. Don’t forget the garlic.
Great if you are on a budget. If you don't want Diabetes i would not recommend it. Do your research
Should call this get the shits hack
So you're telling me a thing i did my whole life is a trending hack on a chinese app? Cool
A what mayo?
Sorry, gross.
Packet noodles are not great. Please understand this.
Damn I guess I completely missed this hack. Gonna try it tomorrow.
Who tosses out ramen water?
Hack?? You mean recipie....?
I'm not discouraging anyone from trying food hacks. But if you're completely changing the cooking method and flavour, to make it taste like something you grew up eating.. what's the point of eating foreign cuisine anyway?
Thats not broth. Thats preservatives.
aka Spaghetti Carbonara - Ramen style :D
Yummy 🤤
Sounds like Ramen carbonara
protip for the BEST ramen.. dont eat it out of a bag. its literally not expensive to buy ramen at a restaurant.
Use a fork. It is vastly superior than using two sticks.
I would use only the yolk honestly
Yeah but I always drain the broth from the ramen...
Have you tried the hack where you add the noodles to boiled water, with the packet?
Mayo is already raw egg soooo....
All that starch lol
instead of mayo i like adding sour cream :)
I came up with a pretty awesome ramen hack myself. See what you do is go downtown, sit at a table, and order a tonkatsu ramen at a ramen shop that makes it professionally. Then after consuming said ramen, you go home .......... full .......... and happy.
Wow a smart hack for once
I usually go with spicy ramen. I've always added  mayo to balance the heat and give the broth a bit of creaminess. Anyone who doesn't add anything to their instant noodles is a heathen.
I mean it’s pretty obvious that egg is good with ramen when most ramen packets that are good show a hard boiled egg and if you ever heard of spaghetti carbonara or egg drop soup this is a similar idea minus Parmesan and bacon in the spaghetti case and plus mayo - “yum yum sauce” is just sricha sauceplus mayo so if a spicy ramen is too spicy for you adding the mayo is basically converting sriracha to sriracha mayo. Even without mayo the egg makes it creamy. It’s definitely older than ‘months ago’ I’ve been doing this for 5 years and I don’t doubt that people from Asian countries probably have been eating ramen with egg since before instant ramen existed. I don’t know who made this ‘hack’ a meme, and I’m sure the first person to put egg and mayo in their ramen is not the same person as the one who posted it as a meme. Green onion also are a standard serving suggestion on most brands of instant ramen. It’s safe to eat eggs over easy or soft boiled so people concerned about that shouldn’t worry about it. Eggs are even safe raw as long as they are fresh, organic and properly washed but I personally don’t like cold raw eggs straight.
Hey what kind of Mayo?
Lisa, do you have a TikTok??
You have to make sure that it has been washed very well before because you can easily catch salmonella by eating raw eggs that are not cooked for several minutes. 🤣🤮
This is disgusting, good food takes time.
Anyone?  No?  Ok I'll take credit for the hack.  You're welcome.
yuck u eat raw egg
Emmymade did this on her channel. So I guess the credits go to her 🤔
Maybe I'm the oddball, but I've been adding an egg to my Ramen since I was a kid. My friend from Korea showed it to me when we were growing up and I've been doing it ever since. I'll have to give the Mayo a try too now. On a side note, Mayo is great to cover chicken in before dipping it in panko and then frying it.
عمت عينج  على هاي الكله اي والله   حبيبتي مو تفهميني غلط بل عكس انا كاعد  امدحج حياتي
I personally could never eat raw egg, just the smell of raw egg hurts my head
We are doing this since 90’s
This is what I did with NI SHIN ramen every time. Mayo, garlic, dark thick soy sauce, oyster sauce. Add in boiled clean water, good to go, taste legit awesome. But it is in dry noodle version, I always add another packet of noodles cause it's too salty. One packet season, two packet noodles.
Just tried this and it tastes SO GOOD (I topped mine off with some seaweed flakes and sasame seed)
Still feel pretty risky in terms of salmonella, do not recommend
Just tried this! Delicious! Thanks!
All I know is I had ramen and I wanted to throw up
The originator of that hack are a million broke a$$ people like me with 28 cents for a bag of ramen from the bodega and eggs in the fridge.
I love eggs in my ramen
Yes I did love it so good 😋
Cant be the only one who hate watery noodle
Me: this looks amazing Lisa: this is perfect for people who thinks shin ramen is too spicy Me, who adds chilli peppers and hot sause to the ramen: 🧍‍♀️
🤢
Looks good
Tbh you could've just add an egg while cooking and mix the egg...It would do the same...Minus the kewpie flavour tho
Did she ate raw egg????
COOKING WITH AYEH
Egg...no thanks
I just add sour cream
If the egg is not pasteurised, semi-cooking it may cause salmonella poisoning.
Feed me 😭
Viral ramen = Wuhan Ramen
How did youtube know I was eating ramen- O.O)
I am glad I have never tried this before 👍
My bf is korean and loves the Shin ramen. Imma make this for him and see if he likes it. Thanks!
I looooooove these noodles never tried egg in it
I poach some eggs but keep them runny so the yolk dissolves in the ramen. I add shiitake mushrooms sautéed in sesame oil, garlic and soy sauce. A small amount of onions sautéed in butter. Mix it all together then top with green onions and Siracha 😍
I personally don’t like egg in my ramen, so this is not for me. (I know I know, I’m a heretic. I apologize for my transgressions against the ramen community.)
I can’t do it.  That egg isn’t cooked enough for me 😬
Yes but mayo no
That looks good 🤤
ew looks gross.. keep it spicy & red for me please 😁😁
Raw egg  Joke   She said something about the broth cooking the egg   I ain’t an idiot
I've been cracking eggs into my ramen since 2006. Adding the 'ay mayo' would be the difference.
Everything has to be a hack. Today I tried the "calling things by what they really are" hack. This is a recipe for ramen preparation. You're welcome
Ask instant noodles from TikTok
“I’m late to this viral ramen hack” Meanwhile, I’d never heard of this hack and might actually do it tomorrow
If your eggs are from an organic grocery store (like Sprouts), you wont get sick from an uncooked egg so it's ok to eat them raw, I've done it with eggnog and I dont have salmonella yet so take it from me lol
how is that a hack? girl, that's just a recipe
The best hack is adding a tablespoon of peanut butter with the spicey sauce. It's amazing
Salmonella? :')
How the heck do you know if the eggs are cooked?
I’ll pass. Like most supposed hacks I call this a fail.
Why is this considered a hack tho? Just seems like a recipe using a packet.
I *think* Inga Lam started this ramen hack?
Eating raw egg is a fast track to dying from food poisoning.
Ummm raw egg? Nah, thanks.
EWWWW RAW EGG!!!!!!
Raw egg🤢
I wish I could save this video on yt. I wanna try it later
Your voice makes me feel like I have a cold. Recover before recording. You're all stuffed up and gross
You all have a weird perception of the word _hack_
Are you okay? Sounds like you need chicken ramen noodle soup. Sounds like you've got a bit of a cold, or some sort of nasal congestion. Drink up, rest well and feel better!
Did the egg and packet ramen years ago, just on a whim. Enjoyed it then and I am certain it has not lost its appeal
Gross
Make kimchi
Disgusting
Kewpie mayo is expensive...
Remove the mayo and I'd be down to try.
Her mouth must be reeking with all the food she eats 🤣
Shim ramyun noodles overrated have. Tasted it
I usually want them spicier
White people will not be able to eat it Cuz its what we call Cooking a raw egg by hot water  We Asians however can eat it.
That brand of ramen was taken away in my country for having excess salt, I can't buy it 😐
I always put a kraft cheese slice in my ramen too it so good
I tried this and I still do this once in awhile! It’s very creamy and take the ramen to a whole new level
🤢 why raw eggs
this is soooo yummy. love this recipe
Nong Shim, the maker of Shin Ramen said that it is the best when it is cooked according to the instructions, without adding other stuff.
The part of mayo 😩 super satisfying 😐
Hey lisa  I am not sure if you'll see this. But in this recipe what can be e substitute for kewpie mayonnaise like maybe an extra egg or something. Thank you
Why the egg?
Don't cut the whole sachet of sauce it not good for nature coz that little piece can not get recycled
Me: Salmonella👁👄👁
More like.. Raw egg noodles🍳😌
Ramon noodles causes stomach cancer.
Been doing this for years now cuz I’m a cheap uni student, didn’t know this was a hack…
The problem is that I hate eggs
This reminds me of dipping ramen
Like ❤️
Its a no for me.... Egg looks raw sorry
Raw egg .. Opps no no I can't 🤢
Do people not realized that the green oions best part is the white. The green is the mature side with no flavor
Shin is my favorite because the spice is good...definitely don't want to do anything to offset that yummy yummy spiciness. If anything I would want to bump up the spice.
How did you get that Japanese mayonnaise!?!?
Yo, just make it like normal but add cheese
No ma'am I want my egg cooked
for shin ramen i like to save the broth, add a little milk and some cheese! trust me it's really good
I followed every step I said and it smells really awful for real, even if I poured the soup in, the smell is still so bad. Can’t eat it
I can't tell that looks delicious coz I feel like the egg is not cooked yet. 🥲
can anyone tell me what QP mayo tastes like? I hate fishy tastes so just wondering if its that. thanks
Add egg in with the noddles while boiling. you can scrabble it or leave it whole
I tried this and its amazing!
Ooh gonna try this!
🔥🔥🔥
Feels like chorro but I’m so down
We been doing this for years lol
Imagine adding Mayo to soup
Whatever wouldn't make me drink the noodles water.. I'm not trying.. uncooked egg and mayo Looks lovely but I'm rethinking
Ghetto gormet
I prefer to put the egg into the boiling water
I love ramen but don't eat it often. It has too many carbohydrates.
Tak hanyir ke
Am I just not a ramen person? "This looks amazing!" No it looks like someone threw up their ramen.
“The color was starting to look interesting”
Bruh, I've been doing this to most all instant ramen for years now. Use less water and hit it in the microwave to thicken it. Let cool 2min. Bowl will be hot
Wow
🤤🤤🤤🤤💯👌🏼💖
Raw egg🤔
Watching this... Made me realize how lazy I am. Cuz literally I just dump it all
Or just add a slice of American cheese towards the end and stir in.
Would this work with regular Mayo? Cause I can’t buy that—
Noooooo Lisa the eggs aren’t cooked 😱
My son did this hack, his name is Josiah. He says you’re welcome
Nope not happening 😩  I can't eat this one , the egg's not cooked properly ...  I'm really kinda impressed by the people who CAN actually eat the dishes with eggs or meat not cooked properly .
I don't know I report her every time but she still coming back
I'm thinking of boiling the water, putting it spice packets, dry noodles, then cracking in a raw egg and letting it poach in the broth  . Then serving it up ramen with a poached egg in it.  That would be super easy .
Omg I recognize those bowls
So the egg is raw..?
I want to try all these cool ramen but I literally only have cup of noodles where I’m at 😩
Thank you I have that EXACT type of ramen
🤢🤮
The raw egg is so disgusting isn't it?
But the egg was not cooked it was raw right...
Haven’t seen the trend done where you slowly add the boiling water 🤔 doesn’t look as creamy as it should tbh it’s suppose to be like a carbonara
Yuhhh 🤮
I thought the seasoning packet was a chicken nugget-
I read this as I have this viral ramen hack
This hack was from japanese netizens. It was posted on a famous forum i believe (something like their reddit). Then it blew up.
This is a Recipe for food poisoning. Egg is def not cooked.
The problem isn't that the shin noodles are spicy, the problem is that packaged ramen is not good for you...
Does she sound like she always has a cold?
bro.... did you just cut green onions with scissors?
I would use the water where i boiled the noodles, but the wax that comes out of then makes my stomach ache and so i tend to avoid it. Wax as in, the noodles are dried and "glued" together using an edible type of wax that melts when we cook the noodles. Ive beeneating that for years and realized its the substance that makes me feel sick. But thank you for the hack! Im gonna try with clean boiled water!!
MAYO IN RAMEN WHY
Mayo? Ugh!
:0
I would love to try this, are the eggs cooked enough for a pregnant person to eat it?
Mmmmmm salmonella 😋
Doesn't look that appetizing but I'll eat it sometime
You can just buy shin black. I don’t know where to get the mayo…not to fond of egg in my ramyun.
Won't it smell of raw eggs though???!!!!
I tried it and it was so delicious it was the best instant ramen Ive ever had
I usually eat it with cheese and egg
I got salmonella eating this
You can’t eggs carry Salmonella
Nasty
This is so good especially when you chop up raw garlic and add it to the mix. Swear I have eaten this over 50 times when I normally eat shin ramyun once a year at most 🥴
Swap mayo for sour cream
I’m too addicted to popping my egg on top
Ew
Ever since I tried it, I use it everytime I eat  ramen It's just so creamy I love it
U eat a of salt
I'm hungry
I'm going to try it soon.
I don’t have Japanese mayo in my city😞 would using regular mayo work? Although Ik the tastes are very different since American mayo is made from the entire egg opposed to only egg yolk
Made this today had no idea it was a viral thing, thought I had a trick up my sleeve.
i just tried it
I don't think the Shin ramen is too spicy. It just makes me so sad that I cry every time.
Yeah it is bomb
I can’t cannot, I can’t eat raw egg in anything no matter how appealing that looks ugh🤢🤢🤢. It has to go through some sort of hit with a pint of oil please
So cool!
so a lot of comments are talking about the egg cooking but tbh, in some countries, eating raw egg is fine, but in others raw eggs aren't completely safe so if ur in the us or something raw eggs should be fine
You can do it in another way removing the noodles and reducing the water add to it the mix keep it for 5 minutes to be cooked and then add the noodles
This video is requested by pipin goldfish
Often, I add a poached egg to my ramen. The egg yolk is pretty runny and mixes with the broth when I break open the egg white.
This is viral? I do this all the time
Imma try this tomorrow
Use a piece of cheddar cheese can get the same result if you won't accept eating raw egg.
I believe Way of Ramen first made it known in the US when he tried to make the recipe. He found it from Japanese YouTuber Harapeko Grizzly (channel name is in Japanese) who specifically used Sapporo Ichiban Miso (flavored) ramen as the instant ramen. He linked the original in his video.
Can we get a 'one time' for ramen seasoning packs?!?! They are gold and flavour bombs in dishes
Day 2 of asking Lisa to put Bts butter as her background music
I tried this method countless time with cheese samyang ramen. It taste really good!! better than the original method.
Remember God loves you😊 John 3:16  For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life. Please change your life around and repent of your sins before it's too late♥️
This looks good, especially with kimchi
Isn't she basically eating a raw egg?
I just add soy milk while boiling the noodles. These ramen are “accidentally” vegan so I eat them without adding any animal ingredient.
I usually make my ramen this way! If you add cheese it takes it to a whole new level 😆🖤
I always fry an egg with a runny yolk and add it at the end. Then I mix/break it up. The yolk does its magic in the broth and the whites turn into chunky bits of protein. I'll have to try it this way. Good vid
I love this comment section (: everything is great and cheerful
Why are you so good at describing food  I just go like it tastes good and nothing else
I tried this and it was alright. I was annoyed that it dulled down the spiciness of the ramen but otherwise it was good
Um.. the egg is raw..?!
What kind 8f mayo is kyupi mayo?
Ramen hack from a few weeks ago? We been doing this since 2009
Skip the egg, It was too eggy for me.
no cuz then i’d get in trouble
Yuck
Easier way to do this is just put the egg at the end
So.. what makes it a “hack” tho?
Try to add Milk
Eeewww
Try cheese in ramen. Its good too.
Game changer!
This is very common way of eating Shin Ramen in the Korean community. I normally just drop the egg into the broth and break it up with my chop sticks.
I use a regular chicken maruchan Ramen, gochujang, minced garlic, egg and mayo. You can do Sriracha instead of gochujang paste but thats all I had for spicy noodles but it tastes amazing 👏
No
At first, I think you'll gonna fry it 😅
I’ve done butter or cheese in my ramen and they have a similar vibe to this
WHO says they are too spicy?
This isn’t a hack.
How do you know when or if the egg is cooked or not
This women is so creative
I decided I was going to try to make it and it tastes sooooo good I tried it with soy flavor noodles and it’s great the only flaw I made was I added a little to much water 😅
Instead of the mayo I like to add milk. Half the amount of the water needed. Makes it really creamy
-____
For the people who are worried about the egg being raw, you can get a similar consistency and flavor by just adding everything to the ramen in the last minute of cooking while making sure to continuously stir. You need to have pre beaten the egg, or else you are pretty much guaranteed to have wispy egg white floating around. It doesn't really bother me, so I don't really worry about it.
Asmr
🤢🤮🤮
Raw eggs??😐
Wont it be salty ? Full pack of seasoning but water only half
The mayo just sounds nasty in this. I could be wrong but it just sounds like a bad idea.
Looks disgusting
I have a hack for noodles: Hollow out furniture and use the noodles with wood glue to repair them after stashing something valuable inside the hole.  Credit: 5-minute hacks 😂
Omgg.. I usually don't like eggs except omelette but I'm craving it from past 1month!! But can't have them rn because of some traditional days 😫👉🏻👈🏻 I want to try out this recipeeee
It's alot easier to boil the noods then throw the egg in duh
dude the egg is raww 🤦😭😭🤢
When I do this I always put less water so it can be creamer yum 😋
Wha-
How did it taste did it taste good
Soggy noodles 🥶
Raw egg😖
Amis
Ramen carbonara
It looks good but does it taste good?
I eat the shin noodles every day
You can try the indian bhujiya that is the most famous in kolkata - I am a bengali indian and you should try this now...I am your old subscribe r lisa... Love you a lotttt
Why TF one has to add a raw egg to a pack of noodles 🤡 awful
looks super creamy
I first watched this from Emmy made in Japan. I think the vid is called "how to make instant ramen luxurious"
just ate it this way and it’s good if you like a lil raw egg taste
I been adding just a little mayo in the chicken flavor ramen just to make it a little creamy. It's good. But it hasn't worked on any other flavor I've tried. Including beef and shrimp.
Raw egg ew
I will for sure try thiss
I'm currently sick and just wanting some soup in general. 😋
🤢🤮
Tha egg is not cooked
Raw egg? really? 🤮
Or you can just buy Shin Ramyun Black
I can’t eat raw eggs
I was the originator it’s on my Twitter
Why is everything called a "hack" these days? You're cooking it using a different recipe. Why use these incorrect terms?
Too creamy
I always just drop an egg with the noodles . Newer mayo . Will have to try
Looks like brain
Eww who eats ramen 🤢
I ACTUALLY TRIED THIS BUT DIDNT TELL ANYONE BECAUSE I THOUGHT IM THE WEIRD ONE LOLOLOLOLOLLOL
Kinda like making chicken soup
It looks good but I'm scared to try raw eggs even though they put hot water
I like the spice so instead of mayo I use shredded cheese. It makes the juice creamy
You don’t know what broth is, right?
For all of you wondering is it safe to eat raw eggs? Well yes and no Yes= If it has something mixed in to it No= If it's like just the egg it has a bacteria thingy
Tempering an egg is not a hack.
Enjoy salmonella
Okay so not an egg fan at all here. I only like it certain ways like fried rice and other Asian recipes or like in a breakfast burrito. I guess my question is the egg taste really prominent? Would someone who only likes egg in certain ways like this? Again I really love fried rice and I know they use egg but I don't taste the egg. I just really wanna add some protein to my Ramen. Id add meat and veggies but I don't have any at the moment, I can never think of a meat that won't take forever and isn't expensive, so im also willing to try spam, again don't know how I feel about that one either though, never had it, I really enjoy fried bologna and sausage/hot dogs though.
Eww mayoo
i’ve made this with migoreng noodles and mix in spring onion with the water aswell and it’s absolutely delicious!!
You had me until you used jarred garlic 🤨
ITS SO GOOD OMG 😩
It’s midnight and I don’t have indomy at home 🥺😭
Pretty nice. I've my ways too since I love 🛢️
It looks really good but is the egg really cooked if it’s still liquidy like that? Wouldn’t it be more like soup with cooked egg bits?
Yukh
Look nice 🔥😋🍜👅❤💯.
Eh, seems like a lot of work.  When I do ramen its usually cuz I'm tired and broke.
This looks good 👍 😋
What is qp mayo made of? There's a lot of hype about this
Raw egg eeu
I want to try this but I’m scared it’ll turn out too salty ?
Pls try squid game honey comb challenge....plssssssss
You’re supposed to use the egg yolk only
How does raw egg would taste? (Just wondering, never tried that before)
What if u dont have that mayo
me 153K exact!
152K yum! 10/7/21
Do something vegetarian! Pretty pls?
What is the flavor of ramen? I think the creator is…
Raw egg??
:)
Can anyone pls tell me if vegetarians can have shin ramyun  I’ve really wanted to try it 🙏 🙏 😭 😭
Lisa jar minced garlic is gross. Use fresh. It's always better
Why is it called a hack though?
That is raw egg
Try kimchi bowl and add a coffee mate..it's good too
what if i added in golden brown pieces of fried garlic instead? 👀 perhaps in butter
🤮
The person who made this was joe.
Omg I have to try this!!
I've tried this. I prefer adding 2 or 3 slices of American "cheese" to it
I was doing this since I was like 10 years old lol like 26 years ago!
Тем временем русские студенты едят дошик с мазиком уже тысячу лет..
Ew
Gross.
Wut u eat egg with out cooking it ( i know its cooked but only a bit how can ppl eat an undercooked egg ) IF ITS NOT UNDER COOKED AND CORRECTLY COOKED IM SORRY IDK
Yuk 🤮🤮🤮
I always add soy sauce, sometimes I will fry a piece of ham and place it in the bowl
but the egg wasn’t cooked?
You just raw eeg
this seems like more steps than just measuring out the water ratio, adding flavor packets to the boiling water, add your noodles, turn off stove when noodles nearly there removing from heat and just creaming an egg into it and adding whatever else
Chheeeeeeeeeee
I just had the same ramen noodles today, extra spicy! But I fried two eggs, cut them up and threw them in the Cup! Yum
I tried it and it was so good but as lisa said the mayo did offset the broth
What about the bacteria in the egg
Raw egg 🤭NO NOT FOR ME
The best ramen hack my hack is use Maggie masala
YUM 😋
Can we get vegetarian food content
IT'S RAW
Eww.
I tried this today and it was good af!
Looks so tasty but so sad that I can’t eat raw eggs or even half boiled eggs 😩
Egg still raw?
Just gonna leave a comment so I can watch this again when I get my samyang. Please pop up in my notif. Much appreciated!
Hello lisa.....I am a fellow viewer of your channel......and I wanna recommend something for you to try out, if your are interested in trying indian dishes then please go for Biryani  it's very spicy and has a good flavour...u can also have eggs in it as it's your favourite ☺️ and you can go for both mutton Biryani or chicken biryani up to your choices......hope you give it a try 😚😚😚
This Japanese channel ----> はらぺこグリズリー (Harapeko Grizzly) is the originator but he made it with Sapporo Ichiban Miso flavor Ramen.
I like the heinous white American I am like adding ranch but for real I think it keeps more of the spice while thickening it and calming it a little
Is the viral ramen hack good with any noodles?
Why did you eat raw egg
I tried it and then I got sick during my vaccination
When i hear someone speaking from there nose.  Clogged nose. It reminds me of Lisa
Put 2 slices of processed cheese to it.... its divine
For those nervous about the egg being undercooked, just do all the steps and then toss everything to stir fry in a pan for 5 minutes.
Her voice sounds like she has a cold all the time lol
I’ve been doing this for years lol
This is kinda how I eat my Ramen, I put in egg whites, chile powder, Louisiana hot sauce, and a little milk
Nope
It was CrEaMy  Woah.......😳
Greeks:yeah we've been having avgolemono for years, maybe over a century. You should try it sometime.  American tiktok: so here's a new hack to make your soups better... bit an egg and add water little by little...  No hate to Lisa at all. It's just funny to see trends that we've been doing for years and now they are "discovered" as hacks.😂
You make cooking look so easy
I've bought ramen that comes with a packet of creamer. Presumably a similar end result. Very good. It was pandan white curry flavor if i recall correctly.
This some old ttrick. Im old af jesus.
Looks pretty good…maybe less pasta water, oh and extra cheese!!
هيبقى حلو اوى لو عندك كورونا وفاقد حاسة الشم والتذوق
Boring voice
This is unhealthy seriously
Isn't the egg raw
Is the egg fully cooked?
i tried this, this is too creamy and eggy for me, im not doin it again lol
What if the egg is not cooked?
Why do you talk through your nose. And why are you on my recommended all the time
Hmm, I've been doing that for quite a while, but with no mayo
I remember doing this before knowing that it became a trend and I enjoyed it but I was afraid that people might think it's disgusting (at least that's what my parents said to my face) so it's nice to see others enjoying it too! Everyone should try this at least once!
You drink the broth too right
I tried it and I hated it...maybe I did it wrong, but I really didn't like the flavor of the egg mixed with the mayo. It's not a recipe for me I guess! 🥲
💜
Yummmmmm
Yo
I just add butter to the noodles.  I like let soup with my noodles. While it's all cooking together finish with butter and stir up good. It gets nice and creamy
i wanted to try it but scared it wouldn't match my taste style. what does the broth taste like? i don't want to waste my shin ramen cup i have only one :3
Delicious hack... GOD Bless you, AMÉN!!
And then add 🧀🧀🧀
Alright people who live in dorms, take note.
I don't know who was the originator of this hack BUT I have been doing this since I was a young girl and I'm now 40🤷🏿‍♀️🤷🏿‍♀️🤷🏿‍♀️ actually my cousin was in prison and when he came home he said that's how they would make their ramen in prison. Apparently if you knew the people in the kitchen well they would hook you up with some extra spices and condiments 👍🏿😆🤦🏿‍♀️🤷🏿‍♀️
I think this is from the YouTube channel called the golden balance, correct me if I'm wrong.
What a combination,  ramen and unborn chicken!
Shin has the best noodles of any instant ramen I've had
It’s like a way to make any broth tonkatsu
Yum 😋
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮👶👶👶🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Looks great. Just wondering what the actual ‘hack’ is? Seems longer than making noodles the regular way 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️
Interesting 🤔!
If this was an Indian recipe, after adding the spices the egg would have been fried and placed at the top of boiled noodles 😂😂
The originator of this recipe in my knowledge is @The Golden Balance
Nice!
I have got to try this! Good job, as always!
Biggest ramen hack ,  by mi-goreng spicy noodles , that is all .
Are you using jarred minced garlic?  If so, try fresh garlic instead. Your (delicious looking) food will taste even better!
Can we use any mayo?
I've done this by accident so many times! I like Mt eggs soft boiled, so the yolk is still runny and when I'm eating it naturally mixes up 😊
Mad
That egg is RAW
Looks good but for anyone that loves creamy texture: go for it. For me, nahh
I highly recommend using milk instead of water and I know it sounds pretty weird I thought it was too but It was really good
Here:- boarding pass for indians  $
Try ramen, with that same method accept add american cheese this time. Yum
Egg is not cooked?
i’ve been doing the hack since 2015 but with two eggs because i like eggs
My mom made neoguri like this when I was a kid! I didn't like the texture of eggs but she wanted to me to get more protein
Nope
Nooo you're supposed to use grated garlic! like so finely grated its basically garlic paste, so make it mix in REALLY WELL! honestly it makes ALL the difference
To make a better broth I like to add a can of chicken noodle soup to my Ramen and not add the chicken flavoring packet. Also add Hidden Valley Ranch secret sauce zesty! But also add some real Chicken pieces to helps as well.
Wait, people think shin ramen is spicy??
Instead of mayo use a spoon full sourcream way better and some lime zest
Am I the only one concerned about the raw egg? 😆
It tastes so good, thank you for sharing this
But you added raw egg. Does it taste good,I don't like the raw egg white and yolk and smell too
It amazes me that I and millions of others people like sit and watch someone make a pack of super noodles 😊🥣
What kind of Mayo?
Can you make a kewpie mayo substitute recipe? It's not available around where I live😭
I tried it but it didn't taste good.🥲😔
I would t trust that not to give me salmonella
Cheese!
But it row egg
Nice way of getting salmonella
What's qp Mayo. Love her voice for some reasin
Hey Lisa! Please try pani puri once! It's the famous street food in India! You can get in online also! Please try it! 😀
Probably the best thing about this hack was the idea of slowly turning the egg into a creamy soup by adding boiled water slowly cuz when I was little I had an idea of adding raw egg into my noodles after cooking so I can make the soup creamier but it ended up tasting raw af
Day two of asking Lisa to try Pakistani knorr chatpata noodles
Asian carbonara?
I don't understand how people get raw egg😧😧😧😧
This just proves that I live under a rock cuz I’ve never heard of this “viral ramen hack” yet…BUT THAT LOOKS SO GOOD.
Does this work on cup noodles?
"hack"  nothing about this is hack
That’s disgusting
I eat it every day, could do without minced garlic though, and I put a lil curry powder in there.
I put way too much garlic on mine… it was quite an interesting flavor, I personally wouldn’t do it again, a slice of cheese for me it’s better
الله يقرفج
Theres raw egg
Wow nice👌👌👌
Wait this was a trend? I've been accidentally doing this for years 😂
I missed your voice
would never eat a raw egg white
This is one im definitely doing when I get my 24 pack of Shin ramyun!
Just tried this in the UK and it’s pretty good
This is probably going to hurt my stomach more (kewpie has dairy? Shin ramyun alone already does) but I really want to try this!!!!
the egg is raw
I don't like mayo but this does look good
I add sliced cheese to my ramen and steamed eggs It's my favorite occasionally snack
Can I do this with regular Mayo and have the same results?
🤮
That mayo is amazing but has a really intense flavor, I don't know if I'd want to add that much.
Try using 2-3 yolks vs 1 whole egg
Everything is a hack lol.
I feel like this is more of a recipe than a hack
I'm sorry but that looks like something I threw up
Mayo in ramen? The originator went to jail I'll let you know that now lol that's a popular recipe in there
I put American white cheese in makes it creamy omg it’s so good
I m making this right now
AAA THAT SHIN RAMYUN IS MY FAVORITE KIND OF INSTANT NOODLE 🥺
You realise the egg is still raw rightm
No no no I don't like row eggs 😣(my opinion of course)
This is the only way I eat my ramen
I tried this... but I wasn't a fan.  Well, the egg thing I've been doing for years, I'm a fan of that but the mayo, not so much.  More on the egg: You can do a soupy egg drop soup type of noodle bowl. Or You can do not so soupy but rich and creamy cabonara type of noodle bowl.
Idk ..but wouldnt take egg would still be considered raw??? Correct me if m wrong because if am i ll happily try this!!
😱😱😱👍👍👍 This is something new would to try it
Fine, I'll try this
Eh I could do without the mayo I do not care for the way mayo tends to coat the mouth
So a normal ramen
You r eating it raw anyway.
Naw that egg is not cooked
Hey when you’re done that you should eat spicy noodles with butter you won’t even taste the spice test your partner to do it I just need one spoon of butter and make the noodles normally and then when you’re done making the noodles add the butter and then put in the microwave for one minute or 30 seconds
If dis is a trend on tik tok the- Who knows if the egg is still raw or not???
doesn't this leave the raw egg-y smell? .-.
Disgusting 🤮
Uncooked egg🤢
Can we can try this with our maggi 😅
Why it's always Ramen, steak and some sauces ? Lisa you can gives us traditional recipes of your origin.And i am really expecting you to make fillipino,thai and Chinese recipes....It is not a criticism or hatred. It is my wish that you can give best contents in your videos.
I didn’t see this hack before this video
I hope the egg got cooked 😭
I don't think this is a lifehack just how Japanese people eat their ramen.
The way you say broth😚😘
Nice way to get salmonella
This is the same kinda thing we grew up with but long since moved away from instant noodles due to doing this a lot as a broke college student.  Never thought doing this was considered a life hack since my parents done this before me but I suppose someone posting it to social media and the world catching on makes sense.
I brought shin ramyun today for the 1st time and I am definitely gonna try this , btw love u and ur channel a lot 💕💕
Isn't the egg making broth smelly?
Just a thing.   Who hates the brown shriveled stuff in the noodles? I just find it super…strange. I liked it before they added that stuff.
YUMMY
I love your videos I literally try everything I see from your page
The eggs won't be cooked - only do this in countries where the eggs have a low risk of salmonella. Definitely don't do this in the US.
looks yummy
I tried this but didn't like it cus the egg still tasted raw but my ppl are used to highly seasoning and cooking foods so that's why
could i use garlic powder or nah
As others have said, it originated from a Japanese person and translated by Way of Ramen and then covered by many other youtubers.
Shin with mayo? 😨
This is my favorite hack for ramen. It's so tasty and delicious!!! I first saw this from EmilyFromJapan
Wait is that raw egg????? 😶😶😶
I ate that -
she forgot the egggggg fried egg!
I read the title as "I hate this Viral  Ramen hack"
I’m looking for my lost twin bealuga
I personally didn’t like this, I guess the raw egg was just really gross for me, the texture was kinda disgustingz
This is essentially a liaison without cream. It's a popular thickener for soups. If you used a bit of cream, you would get an even thicker broth.
My father who was doing it since 2018:
Just made it. It's so good. Used the black skin ramen. I like it 🌶
They eat raw egg? What? What about salmonela? ;(
It’s just your voice and your really pretty
Girl is that autotune because you sound amazing
Mayo in ramen. Gross lol.
Hear me out spice lovers. We use spicy mayo instead… 🥵❤️‍🔥🌶
i actually remove the egg white when i put the egg. for me the broth is richer and thicker
The eggs seem like they would be raw still.  Otherwise it looks absolutely amazing!
Most people can’t eat those raw egg as u eat it too easily. Wondering how you can’t get smell of raw eggs
Can you get samenela from this?
Idk why but I like my instant ramen more on the spicyer side. Shin ramyun are more on the low side for me. Any tips for really spicy ramen I could try?
Wait whAtttt I didn’t know that you’re supposed to do this
Raw egg🤢
Her voice sounds like she has a stuffy nose
I don’t like you
Where do you buy that mayo?
Why mayo?
Who needs Ramen when u have shin 😋 the texture and flavor are second to none
Nice nails
Was really waiting for a fried egg
Or you can use American cheese and it will do the same thing. Probably doesn't taste as good though.
Tempering the egg in the broth, that would make it taste very rich, especially if you added steak/pork/chicken/shrimp and sesame oil like I always do. Yum!
Hate noodles ate to many as a kid im good ill pass
Don't know 😕
Seems good but I'm scared of salmonella
Im doing this before. You can do peanut butter also instead of mayo
What is "QP" mayo?
Maybe this just isn’t for me since i dont like mayo… but it doesn’t look good… like even if I did like mayo i dont think it’d be good w ramen….
dat is not deff from just cooking the ramen normally and adding egg and breaking it up
That does look good but I can never have that because to me that will always be a raw egg😭 ah I wish I wasn’t picky, I’m missing out
Salmonella !!!!!!!!!
Is this considered carbonara?
I don't like raw egg 🤮🤢🤢🤮
That looks SO good 🤤
How you guys eat raw egg😭😭😭😭
I tried this and had some leftover Korean beef tacos added it in and it was perfect
A
Definitely gonna do this my next time I have 2am ramen

Ur egg is not cooked but it look so delicious
I've been doing this way before it was a hack
the broth tho
Those noodles good asf I eat them at work
Nice
This looks like a stomachache🤢
I honestly just boil or fry an egg for when I make ramen. This seems like too much work
I also have that bowl
Your voice is like you are sick or something. Gws if u are
Carbonara
Using the noodle's water is illegal. Id get kicked out from the house
I always use hot sauce and Mayo in my ramen
You're so late
Still $1 ramen soup though. Which means it tastes like $1 ramen
Some avocado mixed into that with a splash of lime , chefs kiss 😘
I thought I was the only one who cut green onions or coriander leaves with scissors cuz I'm too lazy :")
Why you always sound stuffed up!?
Emmymade made a video just like this!!! I’m not sure if she created it, but I learned this from her!
알고리즘 무엇..
I always wonder if the egg is eaten raw 😮😮
I do not find shin ramyeon spicy, maybe I would try this and add some chillis in it
Loosen up.
“Viral ramen noodle hack”….variation of how literally everyone has been eating ramen noodles for years…
U got the energy just like mee
is "hack" a new word for "recipe"?
I saw this hack a while back on Golden Balance’s  YT channel. This is my new favorite way to eat ramen. Delish
yummy
I DID THIS FOR 7 YEARS BUT WITH LEMON
No way!! I honestly thought I was the only person who put mayo in my ramen! I'm so glad other people realized how awesome and creamy it is! Sooo good! I don't even bother with the egg and the other stuff. Just squirt a little mayo in when it's done and mix it up!!
BHAHAHEUE I HAVE THOSE BOWLS TOO HEHE 🦦💖
I did this without the mayo. Except I add beaten egg the the ramen.
Egg still raw
Simple solution to the spice problem: Add more! Also, this looks AMAZING and I thank you for showing us this!
Idk why everything is a hack and not just the thing it actually is lol its a recipe or a variation of a dish lol. When I was a kid my dad showed this to me and people thought I was wierd for it. I just thought it was a substitute for eggs. Mayo is made from eggs if yall didn't know.
But the egg is raw :(
Qp mayo? Can someone explain? Is it different from regular mayo?
I've tried this, and this isn't a spicy noodles?
No mayo 4 me
Trending still
I am going to try this right now omg
Do you recommend this kind of ramen that you choose to make this video because it’s famous and I want to try it but I’m little scared it might be bad. Sorry for my English
the broth tho 
why do so many recipes have to use mayo? it's so gross and sets off my sensory issues
Take out the egg white next time for a less eggy more creamy bowl of ramen
keep going
I always have done this..
What about salmonela?
Finally, a way to eat shin ramyun without crying
It looks very good but you is way to late
I actually tried this with the golden balance video and my stomach started to hurt after but it was really good
You should try adding cheese to it. I know it sounds weird, but cheese in this ramyun is amazing.
GOOD FOR YOU!! LOOKS GOOD!! LOVE IS LOVE 💫🤟🏼🎶♎
This aint new been doing that for close to 10 years
How to get salmanala
When i normally make these i do like a scrambled poached egg with everything combined and then when its in the bowl top with American cheese definitely one of my favorite meals
Yum raw warm eggs
Where all the ramen went
Someone call the firefighters the foods on fire!
I would definitely try this. But I will add the Japanese Mayo on top of the Ramen 🍜 instead 😁
the broth tho 👀🔥🍜
Tried it today! And will definitely be doing it again haha it's so creamy and yummy, loved it!
35 on trending
U can’t eat uncooked egg
I put Grill pork belly on mine
It tastes good. But it overwhelms youd mouth very fast. Maybe it's the mayo i used. Or maybe it's just me. I prefer adding cheese. Gives the same sensation without that after taste.
From the title I thought you were going to fix a table or something
Forgot the cheese
Yay another person who uses scissors to snip up some green onions or herbs ^^ I do this too when I’m too lazy to cut them the traditional way with a good old knife
Could you substitute that Mayo (I’m not sure what it is) with normal Mayo and get a similar effect?
I haven't tried it but aye looks good tho
What’s QP Mayo?
It's not a hack, it's a recipe. Jesus Christ, people.
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates.🎈
Is the egg cooked?
What's the difference between soup and broth?
So basically a Hollandaise Shin Ramyun
Where the h3ll are you finding this brand of ramen?? I am looking everywhere and I can find it!! I found other yummy brands but not this one!!
Do not eat. Trash it.
I want brisket now
How is this a “hack”? At this point your straight up cooking (kind of) the ramen noodles themselves is actually the hack (imo), you know like instant popcorn or hot pockets.🤔
Cute voice. :)
I think the black flavor of shin  does a good job of getting g that creamy garlic broth with the 2nd seasoning packet.  I prefer to have that made normally but with a sunny side up egg and some pork slices on top.
Isn't the egg raw
Have you ever made kewpie mayo from scratch? It only keeps in the fridge for about 3 days, so that's a major downside. But you can customize the flavor to your taste and you don't have preservatives in it. I'd love to hear your opinion on it
Tried this today, I loved it! Gonna make it like this more often
I’ll have to try this. I love having instant ramen with a soft boiled egg, I mix the yolk into the broth and it’s absolutely amazing. The flavor is so much richer
Lisa show ur other roommate
Can you try this with chicken ramen? No extra stuff just the egg?
Should prob simmer for a little. The egg definitely wasn’t cooked if you care
This is why I hate the youtube algorithm. What is this? Too lazy to remove the ramen noodles from the water? Why does youtube show me this junk.
Had to send this one to my hubby.
I’m gonna try it! I have Kewpie mayo!! Thanks for sharing!!
Thank youuuuuu!!!!
신박하다..
Some prison food.
Literally to the 1% who's reading this, Allah bless you, and may your dreams come true, stay safe and have a wonderful day.
Have you tried two tablespoons of Butter in your noodles?? Excellence.
Can you do a video of trying Pakistani food please
Good job on number 11 on trending
I’d put honey in that.
Do this with maggi noodles too … ☺️
You snip your onions too??
Do they only eat noodles😅
NUMBER #10 TRENDING LETS GOOO!!!
Love your videos!!! 🍒❤️
Maggi masala
Its viral in Indonesia trust me all TimTok-ers Indonesia actually did this and they surprise of the ramen, cause the taste was so good and i want it too
Ok I can’t stand they way u talk cuz it sounds like ur nose is blocked or something  But I like ur videos lol.
Raw egg🙂
I have a question, have eat a ramen called maggi. I just discovered you so idk if you had it
Who thought that the egg would start forming lumps when she added the hot water to it
I think you should try another korean soup ramen it's called Yeol (열) ramen. I tried it and it's spicier than shin but not as spicy as nuclear ramen!
Fun noodle fact: slurping noodles is considered polite in Japan
#10 trending
why the mayoo
I tried it and it made me dizzy and I had a bit of vomiting feeling , btw it was pretty good but I guess I won't be trying it again 😅
Hmm interesting. May have to try it. I typically stay away from having an egg throughout the broth just because when I normally add an egg too early to ramen and stir the egg throughout it gets a really unpleasant eggy taste.
This looks so good
This is a weird one  Have you tried indomie before ? I add in a spoonful of cayenne, sugar, seasame oil, and a pinch of salt. Mix it with the noodle contents (powder, oil, sweet soysauce)   After that, add the drained noodles and mix it again To out the flavor, try using raw egg yolk to pair with it.  Yes, you heard me. Raw egg yolk. But this is because I'm from Japan. It's fairly safe to eat the yolk raw over here.
Looks good
I have a legit question....  Why do Asians have egg in everything?  I see all of the street food dishes have egg, even on those huge tortilla looking things.
you’re #10 on trending lisa!!
The egg took the taste off - I normally add mayo to my ramen.
Raw egg
The egg was totally raw 😵🤢🥴
LISTED!!!
I hate soupy noodles , I like mine sticky
this looks like it would be amazing with some sesame oil
Looks good but the egg is raw and is not healthy
Omg ur video is trending!!! Congrats 🎉🎊🍾
I love shin Ramen. My absolute fav. I am Mexican descent so I add like half a lime and have as as side: fresh sliced cucumber with salt and lime. Together is sooooo yum!!!!
Looks like a ramen carbonara. I bet it would be delicious!
#10 on trending wow And that looks so good. No, haven't tried it yet! Stressing the yet.
Eat raw egg?
*Hey, to you reading* .. you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
This really cool ex showed me egg drop noodles and I’ve been eating ramen like that for a while now
Wanna try this but I don't have that type of mayo
Salmonela? Of course
🤮raw egg and water having mayo in it..  Passsssssss
You will seriously get cancer if you keep drinking the noodle water…
Thats not a hack, that's half of my thanksgiving prep
Ridiculous. Cooking noodles in broth makes noodles absord the flavor. Egg goes on top. Garnish with green onion.....
I'll take the credit if nobody wants to take it.
No raw eggs for me.  Thank you.
When did this become a tiktok thing? I been doing this for 20yrs thanks to my love of everything Japanese.
What type of mayo did she use ?
Try out some chocolate ramen ! It would be something different 😁
it looks really good!
Can we boil the noodles with chicken stock?
Did you use those pre-chopped bottled garlic? Remake it with a fresh garlic cloves it will taste Way better. Don't ever use bottled cheap garlic. It's all expired. Always use fresh garlic if you're foodieing, you will thank yourself.
Omg I tried it was very intresting and delicious!!!!!!!!!! Wild crazy how something so strange wise it's a wild combination. 10/10
Day 6 of saying Lisa to try yippie noodles(ramen of India ) Here's a quick recipe:  Use 1 pack of 2minute Maggie noodles and 1 pack of yippie noodles Pour more water like drown noodles and when they are loosen add 1 spoonful of butter and 1 cube of cheese let it melt when it's melted  Add the spice packets and you're done, it tastes yummazing
I eat mines like this
Hi Lisa the egg is a Great Idea. One of my Hacks:   Once I’m finished cooking my Ramen Noodles & the veggies Plus, combine my Hot Sauces.  I like to take a Dollop of Sour Cream. This turn my broth into a - RICH Creamy Broth.  It reminds of the consistency of Creamy Tomato Soup but has a Full Body Thai Food Flavor instead.
What's the difference with the mayo than regular mayo?
That is just pure disgusting to me. how do you the egg is cooked? Do you know where the egg come from ⭕🐔 U KNOW???  eating raw egg in my religion is a gross thing to do
Stop calling everything hacks jesus christ
Will give it a try one day.
This is #15 on trending. I don’t even watch on trending but I love ur vids. Congrats and keep up the good work and content. Also I have to try this
I love those noodles but I'm not a fan of the dehydrated veggies
Dang this is #15 on trending i don’t even look at trending but congrats
Oh my God lol the color is amazing! Where can I get it! It will look great in my shining Chocolate skin.
La Eme invented this.
You ruined it i thought that people got my recipe but yet it has not been discovered
Can I use siraccha mayo 🥺
You were supposed to use only the yolk
I'm late to watch this video. Nonetheless, alwaysthemore, I enjoyed the hack!
The broth looks like my puke.
This looks like something that would be sold at a fancy restaurant
Wait, recipes are called "hacks" now?
I ate those before but I have the 2x times hotness it's really hot!
Have you tried the hack of throwing away the ramen noodles and cooking a good Italian pasta dish, like carbonara? It's super simple and better than the salty and greasy instant noodles.
Nom nom looks great
Add a dollop of peanut butter 😍
People eating raw egg like they having a luxury cheese.
I tried shim ramyun yesterday 🥳 omg it’s was bomb but after five bites it actually hurt eating though I did finish it 😂
Dang now I’m hungry
I saw it on Emmy Made and I think she said where she saw it.
If people can afford all the extra ingredients they wouldn’t be eating Ramen….
I'm trying this with 2x spicy ramem I found in my cupboard
I thought you were going to make ramen carbonara!  Kinda disappointed it wasn’t (cause I LOVE carbonara ) but still looks good :)
I want to try this but at the same time I always puts lots of spices to my shin ramen because I find it not spicy enough haha
@Sssniperwolf
Old school 101 holmes
I use that exact same bowl for drinking soup lol
Congrats on trending 🥳
Can it work with regular mayo? There's no kewpie mayo in my town.
Isn’t the egg raw and is that okay?
Who else live ramen
The shin black has a creaminess (maybe similar to a tonkotsu broth?) and is less spicy if not spicy at all
Day 131 of asking Can you instead of just eating the level 7 noodles right away do it step-by-step? so by the time you get to 7 you’ll be ready!!😁
So I tried this a few weeks ago and hated it, didn’t like the consistency of the broth.
I wonder how well this would work with the Buldak 2x spicy ramen...
Have you ever tried Koshari, it’s pretty good. Sometimes it’s served with this red sauce that’s also delicious
Seen this awhile back from a girl named Emmy on YouTube. Maybe it was from her.
Yum.
Try adding a slice of American cheese! Makes it creamy also
Day 1 of asking Lisa to make spicy chicken tenders with jovi Greene’s recipe
Ha I just did this yesterday 🤣 I used normal mayo though cause I don't know where to find kewpie in my country. But it was still delicious.
ربما اعتقد بأن المذاق رائع
Does anyone know of any vegetarian spicy noodles? I personally haven't seen a spicy ramen challenge that features vegetarian noodles. Been vegetarian for a decade but love spicy noodles and always have to hand make it, which I dont mind! But yeah just curious
im sorry but your so unhealthy.
Day 1 of asking Lisa to make a Chuletas Fritas and hot sauce spring roll
mayo in ramen? 🤢🤢🤢
I'm a bit hesitant because of the raw egg part.
Lisa according to you what would be the best breakfast which would get a 10/10
Since you asked for the originator - first saw this on the Way of Ramen YouTube channel! But he got it from a Japanese YouTuber I believe!
I just finished eating some cheese hot chicken ramen, I wish I coulde’ve seen this before because I would’ve tried it immediately i’m gonna save the hack for some shin ramyun now ahah
This is a creamy alternative to cheese with egg drop in my opinion.Lisa you suppose to put the slice of cheese on last after pouring ramyun.
wait this is the ramen that I buy-
I want to try this so bad because I looove ramen
3rd attempt of asking Lisa to only eat halal food for a day
I love watching these videos 😋💖
It was me, I started this trend. Now bow to me peasant.
I’ve seen your videos loads and love them they’re so soothing, I tried making steak, ramen and spinach spring rolls with other veggies, I really love cooking and I feel like I did a great job, however I could let get past the gummy texture of the rice paper which is a real shame since I spent a good 2 hours on the dish 🥲
This looks  pleasantly delicious.  I'm trying to do more with ramen but haven't gotten too far in terms of experimenting, the closest today was making a regular pack of ramen, frying and egg and topping it with chives. Although I did put salt pepper and garlic powder on top of the egg whilst frying,  it was pretty good for being a bit plain compare to what you do with ramen. 😅 thanks for trying and sharing , I shall try this soon. Xoxo love from Trinidad
Hey Lisa how do you stay so fit but eat all this food? Advice?
Pretty sure a lot of people do this wouldn't say there's an originator lol
So ur eating salmonella?
Best instant ramen brand on the planet!
Day 85 of asking Lisa to try bajan food🇧🇧
Hi Lisa could you make a long compilation with a bunch of your shorts? I love binging them 😫
Yay! You made ramen again.:)
i always add eggs to the boiling broth and mixing it up. Never tried it like this tho
LISA PLEASE TRY THIS!!!:  First: boil ramen noodles and strain (set aside) Second: in a sauce pan put in garlic, oil, red pepper flakes. Stir Third: add the noodles and mix Last: add 1 egg and mix till egg is cooked and incorporated. Enjoy ;)
Hi Lisa I have COVID and you been helping me feel better every time I watch your videos I might not make it but I love your content
Why are their always 1 minute
I don’t trust of the egg is cooked that way I just put mine in with the noodles and all
Can’t tell you how much I love your voice and videos. I hate eggs, I  might puke at the sight of someone eating it and can’t bear the smell of it…but would still watch you. Keep going.
The broth looks so smooth and yum 😌
Kewpie mayo 🤢
This wasn’t good my opinion mostley cuz of the egg
🤮🤮🤮raw egg
I’m not even korean but I’ve been living in Korea for a while. But this trend triggers me on nationalistic levels 😂😂
Anyone who never ate noodles with chopsticks✋️
ok but @ any of you that are like “the egg is raw I can’t-“ per chance do you eat Mayo?
YES FINALLY LISA TRIED IT NOW I CAN TRY TOO.
You learned this just now? I’ve been doing this since 2003.
This looks discusting
She just poured hot water over raw egg wouldn't it smell bad? And the egg is not even cooked
Gonna skip the mayo for me though
*Lisa,it's better late than never!* ♡
Looks delicious! But scary, this is like a 700 calorie dish at that point 😅
Hiiiiiiiii❤️❤️
Really love your voice
Has anyone tried it with regular mayo?
My mind is not convinced about the egg being cooked (I know it’s cooked but I can’t convince myself to eat it😔)
here’s another viral hack that’s right up your alley: the rice paper tteokbokki hack that was viral for korean food content creators! you should definitely try it, lisa! 🤗
It was originally a ramen hack from a japanese website or a chef I believe, but then it was translated by thewayoframen to english and that made it popular
I enjoyed that spicy noodle. It's taste is perfect & smell is good. Now I gonna try like your way 😋😋😋
You should def do the rice paper boba one next too pls
Ye it’s spicy but taste good
I luv your voice
Looks like a ramen carbonara. I bet it would be delicious!
So what you're saying is to add some serranos to bring back the spice that the mayo is cutting.
Who created this???? Ichiraku and his ancestors. I’m sure
The good old ramen videos
Not bad, but tbh, too time-consuming. Y'know I'm not a fan of swelled-up noodles 😂
In here it night
Your bowl is so pretty! Doobydobap just posted a delicious Shin ramyun hack making a chili oil. I think you might like it
I love Ramen, but I can’t do raw eggs cooked by emulsification or boiled water 😑
Emmy Made in Japan, at least that's where I got it.
Ohhhh nice I just bought ramen for myself today haha
Have you tried this?
My favourite brand I got a box off Amazon 🤤
It was actually from a Japanese video which was first translated by "Way of Ramen" into English for us to enjoy, his video did cover the original video as well
hey love from india🤍🇮🇳
Days 18 of asking- Can you try maggi with egg , paneer , siracha , soy sauce and cheese . It taste amazing 😊😭😊💖
this is making me so hungru
0:05
Yo,right kn time there we go again 200k likes coming bruhhh
Claim ur here before 1 hour ticket here >:)

Yay another person who uses scissors to snip up some green onions or herbs ^^ I do this too when I’m too lazy to cut them the traditional way with a good old knife
Wow!
Hey Lisa I actually wanna recommend u an indian instant noodles would u like to try it it's taste is just out standing ✋😃
Add  tiny squid. Two or three.
Love all your videos Supporting u since years Still u won't pin me?
I’ve tried this and this is the only way I’m eating ramen from now on
Day 73 of asking lisa to try Yippee noodles from India please If you see this please heart me ❤️
Jalepenos , Cream Cheese , Takis Part 3
This looks so good😭
Have you tried the hack of tossing the noodles in a sauce made with butter, garlic, red pepper flakes, soy sauce and brown sugar, you drain noodles and mix with the sauce and then scramble an egg in the same pan and mix all together… very tasty!
Better Late then Never. Or something i guess. But yeah Ramen is allways dope
I stir the hot noodles into the broth so the eggs are semi scrambled. It helps add texture.
please try making south indian food! 🙌🙌, and also what do you other than the fact that making shorts on YT? if i may ask that 😅 and also i love your shorts ❤️❤️
You can watch “Emmy made in Japan” she made a video on this. I believe she mentioned where she found the recipe. So that might be the person who made the recipe up.
wooooo! love ramen hacks
I love your vids!!
Day 131 of asking Lisa to please make Fresas Con Crema 🙏
First! Also yay no dislikes! >:3
