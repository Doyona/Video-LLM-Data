Sshiiiiiiit the schools in my area here in Oklahoma the teachers and principal can still warm that azz up frfr. I had a hickory wood paddle broke across my azz by my coach damn I’ll never forget that whippin! My kids even know that if they ain’t respectful at school that when teacher gets done busting they azz that ol dad gonna give them twice as many and twice as hard   Only thing I allow them to do is to BULLY da BULLYS. they will get in trouble at school but not from dad cuz I’ll take them out for ice cream and reward them for kicking bully’s azz. Real talk

Young Dolph made you because your mother wasn't there
Boy in love with his mother incest at its finest
He ain't lying, once upon a time Gucci & Juicemane was more popular than food stamps in the south

yk you high when you rocc back nd forth😂
Realest nigga in da game fr
I got big ice 😂😂😂😂 I was just 6 playing with sticks yeahhhh
Russian cream gang shit no lame shit 😂😂😂
Summer walker???
Whoever the dude interviewing Giock gotta be younger than him. I WATCH OFF THE PORCH TOO. BUT HOW YOU NEVER HEARD ABOUT WHOOPINGS IN SCHOOL?
The other him I'm dead
Key Glock has the right mindset of having no features because it’s sad when other people who have money and fame want to feature because of business . It’ll make both of y’all sell more records together as well as individually . It’s best to make your own music expressing how you feel and if it sell records it do . Always stay true to yourself never let anyone especially never let another Man make you feel less important and less talented .
He’s smart not to work with other rappers. Fuck that friendly shit he doing just fine by himself 💯
He mad antsy! I'm ♌ so I know his energy we can't seat still!
So this yellow tape tour didn't jump off til after Young Dolph was gunned down.. hmm
Bless this one 🙏
No bullshit I got paddled by every teacher i ever had in Nashville Tennessee

Praying for you in Jesus name.
Love you too Glock
Glock is ahead of his time. To a lot of people he’ll be considered cocky but he knows what he capable of. Like he said he manifested it he know what he can do. Talk yo shit 🐐
That no feature shyt is wack! Nicca never put Dolph on 1 song! Only rapper who gets away with this is J COLE & Glock doesn’t even come close to that! Dude’s too emotional, I mean I understand the whole no trust thing but this is the music “business” YOU NEED PEOPLE my boy!
20 for 20 , my dawg glizzock.  Speaking from Miami 👊
We definitely got whooped in the south by our principal...
I think this dude could be a whole lot smarter if he put the cup down and picked up a book. No disrespect at all he’s real wise, could go much farther but definitely needs to lay off the drink.
My dude stay strong 💪💪 positive get money 💰💰 stay sucka free don't feed into bullshit get yo bag young man proud of u and the real King of Dolph and the whole PRE organization y'all the truth and y'all haters know it keep working bro
We (fans) love you too🙏❤💯
Excellent interview
Bruh Lost His Lighter At 4:25 Lol He Ran His Fingers Across His Pants Like A Spider 🕷 😂😂😂😂😂 Im Dead Asf‼️
KeyGlock is a smart man.
Key Glock & Normani🥰Couple
I gotta say. I'm a new York cat and I been WAITING for an artist like GLOCK AND DOLPH. I discovered them both about 6 months ago. That being said I learned about the history of paper route frank,, and respect that man flipper to the fullest! The loss of dolph impacted waaaaay more people than I can imagine at that point. God Bless him and his family. And Key I can't wait for more material big player!
Glizockkkkkk 😍

I love you Mr. Glock
YNNARZHON
Dolph taught him well. The haters didn’t stop nothing. PRE for life.
Who else went back to look where he put the lighter when he was looking for it😂😂
Once bro lost his lighter he caught the shakes
Don’t judge me y’all but my spiritual eyes are on I see so much trauma on this young man soul. He literally has high energy of being very uncomfortable. He definitely don’t like interviews which I respect it because everyone isn’t for you even in interviews. It’s all what ppl can gain from you. He can’t be still he keep swaying back and forth. I pray that God protect him lord send your angels to watch over him . He’s not safe praying for his protection and soul . God is real it matters how we live our lives how we lead ppl are watching us . Just wanted to share my thoughts on this young man because most of us see fame and money some of us see a gift that need to be protected and guided in the right direction. I see someone who is a son a brother father God child . He bring us here for purpose that we do his will his soul is my concern . I want him to make it to heaven that God be pleased .🙏
That jacket fire!
💙🤴🏿🐬🕊🙏🏿
GLIZZZZOOOCCCCC SALUTE PAPER ROUTE EMPIRE THE WBOLE FAMILY THE WHOLE CREW LOVE YALL ALWAYS MISS KING DOLPH . HE AINT GO EAT HE JUST SLEEPING BEAUTIFULLY
I remember getting spanked by school staff too.

He wants to kick that cup.
He doesn't have to drop another song as long as he lives. Let G take as much time as humanly possible fureal
I remember putting everybody at school on to glock 😭
My Boy Mind So Fucked Up Right It Don’t Make Sense
Love how rappers always answer/Don't answer questions.  Always funny to me lol
Key is right about Memphis City Schools being able to whoop kids with paddles. I'm from Louisville, Kentucky but went to high school in the 10th grade in Memphis, Tennessee. I skipped class and learned all about that damn paddle 🤬🤬🤬
That “say no more” 💪🏾👍🏾
I’m screaming 🤣🤣 “I don’t know who that is” exactly because WHO IS THAT nigga
I’m happy that he doesn’t have anyone on here but him. Most of these rappers come 100 deep that’s nothing but trouble
Boa sound like dolph n all🤦🏽‍♂️ r.i.h king 👑🙏🏽🙏🏽
Glock hard he can carry p.r.e.
🤔"What I'm I Going To Get Out Of That.. A Couple Hand Shakes & Some Fake Laughs..  I'M STR8" 🔥🔥💯🔥🔥
RiP young Dolph key Glock keep your head up there ain't no trust in this life really trust get you killed
It's been confirmed dolphs people was behind the dolph hit so u can't put nothing past glock until more details emerge
It's crazy that he has a look of (sadness & hurt) in this interview, not knowing that Dolph would be assassinated like 2 weeks later ..🥲
Subconscious anxiety
I'm happy he's strong like Dolph. I hope he know his fans thinking bout him and hope he healing 💖
No lie I was getting padding in middle school
Memphis lost .. Martin Luther king .. then Elvis... now Dolph...we gotta do better
“Aint Nobody Tried Me…Shyddd” 🤣🤣🤣🤣
A D & D Pt 3 Woulda Been 🔥 Fasho Rip Dolph
Don’t go back bro it ain’t safe
Man u can see the pain in his eyes
I do the same shit Bruh. I saw u put the lighter down I said that nigga gone forget 😂
Can’t switch is one of my favorites 🔥🔥
I rock with #KeyGlock all the way here in #NewOrleans🎤🎶🛸🌎🛐
Dude music trash but ya ll dudes think everyone goat's which is absolutely ridiculous but ok.  LLD
It take one Time!!!
LLYD
We gotta protect Glock at all costs!!
It' was a big thing in the south to get spanked at school, I never got one , but know a lot who did, your parents always had to be present though.
The moment when you realize Glock lost his lighter🤣, love how humble he is and he is definitely still killing shit, RIP 🐬‼️
He looks so old but he only 24. That’s all the lean. His new album is dope tho. I love him . He so laid back.
All I need is 10 Mill or more no cap ‼️
Man even know they cousins it's weird like at moments like you hearing Dolph
This interview was everything hes so mature and humble and may god continue to bless him and his family during this time of losing his cousin #LLMAINMAIN 🐬🕊💙
Nice young buck, but still needs solid leadership to grow in the industry, PRE still needs an OG to run it that’s honest and loyal and has principles…just think he knows enough yet, Dolph still had more skin in the game exposure…
@8:27 lmfaoooo you already know!!!
Key glock and lil baby sound similar
Glock high as hell 😂😂
💙💙🐬🐬
RIP DOLPH 🥺❤️
Long Live King Dolph 🕊🙏🏽
Don't Know Who To Trust on repeat!🎧
Dat boy from tha Ten😂😂🔥
Bro you slurring like a phuck - that's not good - stay prayed up though
glock was just now starting to be more open with us and them folks really BLEW IT. #longlivedolph
“Brought to you by Wockhardt and Actavis.”  Anyone else find the 4 double cups staged behind him, the dirty Sprite and his own double🥤a bit odd?  I know it’s part of the culture but this stuff is super addictive and really bad for you.  My man is fuckin’ it 🆙   PRE Hard, ya hate to see super talented artists playing with they’re health and lives.   RIP 🐬  Stay up 🔑G🔒

Smokin Russian cream shoutout glizzock Rest up Dolph

You never gotta pick a side. How bout I'm with none of you niggas, how bout I let yall smoke each other and take a step back and watch. If I gotta choose between 2 friends I'ma choose my side.

Key Glock never never outshine the master one of the rules in 48 pPower of law by Robert Greene they asked him did he used to bother bySound like Young Dolph listen to his reaction I don’t sound like that bitch I don’t sound like that Knigge never outside the master
Key Glock stay focus homie. Put PRE on your back and keep pushing. The streets going support u. #LLDolph
Bullet proof the whips
He was speaking some real shit…. Popular loner type of vibe
Ask gang what they wanna ride in this y’all shit too. Sound just like dolph and he got on that watch he bought from icebox
His energy is unmatched and he’s my favorite artist. I just love him g, I’m praying for his mind and consciousness. I’m praying for his heart and his family. It’s Paper Route 4L 🤍🤞🏽
It’s so crazy to know you went to school and grew up with these same individuals!!!! And they are all INTELLIGENT IN THEIR OWN WAY
Key glock Chingy son.  Right thurr.
Dolph first cuzn .❤️Key Glock 💯👈
“I dont need u my boaa” dolph taught em well
Sounds like it was known things was coming to an end… RIP Dolph
Key Glock babe you got this. U can do this with out dolp, dolp would want you to go head n take it to the MF top n don't let that money stop whatever you do get the money... Plan B get to the Money. Make big cuz proud.
I know this man fucked up memtally fr
I’m fuckin wit gangsta
26 minutes in thats when l knew young dolph was dead he shouldnt have said that pay you what you want and how you not making music next year dolph gonna work ya ass oh unless you drop his location to yo gotti for 2 million
I fuck with all the songs 100%
He really dropped channel 5
He knew his "mans" wasnt gon make it to see 2022
7:05 When Bandplay name was mentioned Key Glock started boppin his head like he heard a beat. Thats how long them niggas be in the studio together 😆
Looking for that lighter on the low lol
I dont trust him. He will be doing something else planning thats why his cousin gone. I am sure i saw video that he knows about Dolp. You see they have to work hard like Dolph to reach where he got and the younger they are they are more lazy they want easy money. I noticed he didnt big up Dolph who helped him to reach where he is. His stepmother asked Dolph to take him under control as he didnt listen. And Dolph helped him and i dudnt heard him giving him gratitude. I hope he is not involve! Rip Dolph!
Him and Dolph laugh alike it’s crazy.
That bill gates
Alot of glocks music remind me of project pat. Pat has been my favorite rapper since like 95
This the niqqa that got Dolph setup...wanted his position.
prayin for him rn  rip dolph
He’s so fine 😍😍😍
🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬Long Live Dolph

Man rip dolph, may God help Key Glock find peace💯
Great interview Glock been the truth ✨
Bruh the lighter is in back of you...lol
Glock needa stay independent
Hand him a lighter already smh
People who say Memphis is small never leave out their hoods.Memphis/Shelby County is not small dude
Man this is why he will always say the same things and rap the same way. You work with other artists and learn from them.
He even laugh like dolph😂😂😂😂
My only problem with his music is he can’t rap his beats and flow hard but he has some weak ass bars but this recent drop I noticed his improvement actually got my attention I’m fr hoping he keeps progressing cause he got the beats and flow just needs that last touch
Fav rapper in the game rn
School beatings been over before he got in elementary....straight cap
The lighter is behind him smh 🤦‍♂️
LONG LIVING LEGEND
they made it popular to be a junky
17 mins latta his homie tosses him tha lighta 🕯
Key Glock reminds me of that guy who is humble af, and just stays to himself. He doesn't seem like a person I would play with just on how he carries himself.
Honestly Glock music has went downhill…Nowadays people listening to NBA, Shiesty, Big 30, Baby, or even they’d listen to King Von before him. PRE should drop a mixtape with NBA
“I ask gang what y’all wanna ride in this yall shit too” really came from the bottom all the way to the top with the same people he grew up with 💯💯💯
He needs start workin with other artist after selling 30k first week, no diss .
Dont kill us with no music next year. I hate instagram lives , cant save the music 😤
Glock and TEC are the hardest ones in the industry
I don’t listen to his music but I seen a couple interviews he’s most definitely different from the rest of the industry!!
OhMane 💪🏽
My nigga can’t find that lighter for shit, he keep robbin himself for it…..and he speakin BIGG FACTS, I used to get my azz whooped back in the day when Airways was a junior high school in Memphis……7th grade🤣
55
You Kan Tell When That Drink Hit Em🤣🤣
They don’t wanna work with him his tunes trash 😂😂
DIRTY GLOVE BASTARD USE A REAL ONE!!!GOT A SUB FOR LIFE!!!!
He so handsome
Hes intelligent but you can see the PTSD. The streets, not growing up with his mom, school. Still my favorite rapper
I respect that
the asap bsap's whateva i rolled 😂😂😂
We was getting paddled in Chicago to the gym teacher paddle me & the principal he not lying
P.R.E GLOCK Mane He one of the Coldest Next to Big BRO Skeerr!! I fell in Love with the whole Movement. Cause these the same people from The woods I come from.Money Dont make you but the opportunity to get your life right is the Biggest Blessing. YOUNG MAN take the stage.Cause God Says it's your Time.Keep Pushing Ace!Yea you Rich,But How many People under you that you Employ?.The Loyalty is what keeps you in Chair.Stay BLESSED Always. 😇💯💯✊
Was a law Your teacher can whoop you, oh for real? hell yeah? They still doing that in Tennessee? HELL NOOO! lol
I wonder if he has a little social anxiety or just naturally reclusive.. or introverted.
U know u smokin dat gas when u lookin for the lighter n jus had it l🤣l
Soulja Boy probably watching this yelling at the screen saying " That's Cap "
Glock been killing shit since he been out.
WHY IS HE DRINKING AIR OUT OF AN EMPTY CUP??????
my boy lost his lighter for a lil minute & went though a quick ass panic mode 😂😂
Glizock🔥🔥🔥 a deep PRE fan from ivory coast🇨🇮
He gotta great mindset!!! Continue being great Glock!!! Had to come show love he from the city🙌🏾💯💯💯
Memphis Legend 🎶🔥

Who the hell was saying he sound like dolph mane stop it 😂😂‼️‼️‼️  If u from south Memphis and knw dolph music and sound you can definitely say Key made dolph better, rapping bout guns and being a crack baby was tiring and over played yeah keyglock definitely saved dolph sound and hustle lmao salute tho !!!

GLIZZOCK 🔫
South Memphis Big Playa shit ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Where the Lyta bomboclat
Mufuka stop movin. Act like u in front of class reading a paper the way you movin
Key Glock is definitely rocking on my playlist
Glock ya lighter behind you Cuh 😂
McLaren going bankrupt fun fact. Mclarens are trash cars. Notice he don't got many ferraris lol

Nigga ain’t jumped off no porch at no 6 years old.. that’s the biggest cap ever
That shit was in Detroit too. Mfs thought they was gone whoop me. Mf better give me a walk home pass and suspension.
I think dude is kida role model. he not hood but not a lame neither like  wiz khalifa mixed juicy J
Y’all my brothers got some hard music on my page we getting overlooked like for real 🤦🏽‍♂️
rap isn't WORK or MUSIC rap is cRAP
Its a act every new rapper n the think they got to be gangster  to make good music
Glock Had it For Memphis  Pooh shiesty came and just Blew up fast  But Looking like Glock Retain it back Come back artist Award 💯
In my opinion Glock and Dolph should’ve been on the 2nd how high movie 😂 that would’ve been dope as hell
These young dudes from my city ain't playing.. I like how they really focus on the craft and not just riding everybody name . They building they own name.
Glock gave him the right and perfect answer when he asked about lil logo
That number 1 man 💯💯💛💛💛🚧🚧 the 1 not the 2
Im 32 years old from Memphis, I've seen alot of key Glocks, alot of rappers who where young, had the look and the swag but drugs took them out. Started with Playa fly, zed zilla, and even snootie wild. Hopefully Glock stay focused but if you listen to his old music you can tell a difference in his flow when he was sober.
Eve was hard
Glock capping about the teachers giving ass whoopings ...... he freestyling good as hell tho loll
🔥🔥🔥
🤘🏾 Keep doing you GLOCK & DOLPH staying in their own lanes & making MAJOR MOVES !!!!!!  PRE 👊🏾
HARD TO FIND REAL NOWADAYZ.. PROTECT THIS MAN PLEASE!
These rappers are culturally, and socially, screwed up individuals. For real!!!!
Playa😭
BIG GLOCK‼️ PRE
Glock: Breathes DGB: That’s real
Leviticus 19:28  “Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print any marks upon you: I am the LORD.”

He drinks the blunt gets baby sit 🙄😂💯
Y’all crazy as hell if you think Key Glock last few albums been hard. Still rapping the same abc rhymes and he need features at some point. He not really saying nothing crazy in his flow
My babbbbyyyyyyyy 💛💙 I love him
Young Dolph putting his people in power in position for being a boss love to see it
Yea AL i almost got paddled...I was elementary school called Whitesburg..and it was white like all white school think only reason i got in because my dad was military and VA where I'm from they did that back in the day...
Glock been setting trends
Glock!!!! 🔥🦁
Eve is the best song
I had EVE on repeat the first day i heard it
He right I haven’t pass one of he songs
No gimmicks no industry bih PAPER ROUTE BIZNESS 💪🏾
I f*ck with every song on the album but the "Gangsta" track, I be skipping the hell outta that one for some reason, it's not a bad song but the beat just don't do it for me
I haven't wrote a song since🤣I see why his shit be trash
Bro can speak facts💪🏻
Did I meet him at the gas station shell in wa
Glizzzock🔥
He to vice lord!!!
"PRE WE DON'T DIE...!!!" PRESSURE
It's Glock! I been bumping Glock & Pooh Shiesty back to back....They both jukin right now......
What’s that song called
If I could like this more than once I would
🔌🔌🔌
If he dont stop wallowing from left to right. Be still boy!! 🤣
remind me of Slim Dunkin Rip dunk
I would love to be your personal barber
Damn I hope he didn't really mean he wasn't going to make music next year. G🔒
Damn you see all these Industry rappers with fame and Fortune but they all sold there souls, they all signed there life away. Glock can rap better them, have more cars, more jewelry, and didn’t have to sell his soul to a major label.
Is it he doesn't work with them or they don't wanna work with him? Glock cool but I don't hear or seeing anything to make people wanna work with him... Dolph now? That's different.
FINALLY 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️ been waitin for dis da one an only
🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧 PRE LONG LINK BANK 👼🏽🙏🏼
Damn he such a real dude. Got a good sense of humor about life you can tell. I wish him the best man I really do. He needs to be interviewed by someone who he probably identifies with more. I hope Glock never change bro but I do hope he puts down the Wock
Just how south jersey is on some real
It's Glockkkkkkk!!!!
This boy gotta be into big Bitcoin or summ fr he’s money too long 😂🔥🔥
It never stops with our people with the ALL my shit paid for narrative it’s by far one of the silliest things you can do when it comes to cars smfh..

He's smart. He knows that these rappers aren't friends, they're co workers (if that). Be respectful, but not friendly.
