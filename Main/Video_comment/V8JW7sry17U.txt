Stay strong Ashton, you got this mate!!!
Ben mate you’ve gotta get yourself a serious mountain bike and hit the monkey trail over cannock chase it’s 24km and it will chew you up and spit you out worse than the roads will, a perfect mix of up hill and down hill dirt you’ll never go back on the roads again
Stay strong Ashton it’s a tough time but pressure and hard times create diamonds!! Be brave and strong and you will achieve anything
I wish Ben would have done these when he was at United. Would have loved to have seen the go pro action from the Manchester 2009 derby 4-3.

Foster is a sick guy how’s he juss casually getting about with a GoPro🤣🤣🤣🤣 watch everyone start following the trend now😅😅 I liked Foster when he was at United n as a United fan I would’ve liked to see him play more often that he did👍🏾👍🏾 but obviously he was behind Van De Sar so it’s understandable why he didn’t play too much🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️ still remember him in that league cup final against Spurs n even tho we lost he still played really well👏🏾👏🏾 the way McSauce was looking at him at the end was jokes too😂😂😂😂
Stay strong, Ashton! Get well soon!
Stay strong Ahston!
Best wishes Ashton mate stay strong for all of us 👍
Why is man riding across a frozen field with a road bike
Did you find out who took your parking spot?
Name a more iconic duo than Ben foster and tomato ketchup I’ll wait
Hi Ben you should set up a just giving page for Ashton and give the shirt to someone who donates!
Every single one of Bens videos:   “Oohh tripple esspresso”  Cycles   “Lets go see the lads at training”  “Lets get on the coach”  “Av a look at the hotel”  Dinner: “This rooms MASSIVE!”  “Gotta kill some time, got a late kick off”  “Little stretchin session in the morning  “You little beauty.”  Matchday: “LOVE THAT CLEVS” *Shouts at whole defence   The end
HEAD UP ASHTON!!!!
All the best Ashton . Stay strong and you’ll be ok ❤️❤️
Take it easy Ashton. Just so you know, there's something that gives life to the body, as without it we are lifeless. We are the intersection of a physical body with a non-physical consciousness. People not familiar with spirituality will generally think the brain produces consciousness, but neuroscience proves that this is false. There is in fact non-local consciousness that runs the brain. Meaning that the core essence of who we are is 'divine consciousness' experiencing ourselves through the human form. You are spirit who is having a human experience. So what are the qualities of these aspects of the human costume that we wear in order to experience physicality? Most of us are so intimately familiar with the costume that we completely identify with it as the 'me' and 'I' as we’re talking and generally forget the consciousness that is living through the human brain. We think we're the voice inside our head talking to us, or simply a by-product of the brain. But in reality, it's a highly convincing illusion or sleight of hand. Your energy will be useful in multiple dimensions.
Hope u the best Ashton 👊
Best wishes Ashton! Stay strong❤️
Imagine roy keane seeing this
Best wishes, Ashton!
Please do not retire.

Literally 99% won’t see this but I lost my job due to covid. They shut down all the restaurants in Cook which then led me to losing my apartment. I'm currently living out of my car which I try and make the best of. I've applied to a bunch of places I'm hoping to get a call back. if anyone could help me with whatever you could bc I'm needing stuff like hand warmers which I stuff my clothes at night when it's cold. Also cheap burgers/fastfood. I know times are tough for everyone these days but if you're able to help me I have paypal username pay2winlife  If you're unable to help I totally understand  God bless you stay safe🙏

William the frog has a dark truth behind his image of being a grandson to a woman that has been made she is a queen. His wifes truths are not as bad as his truth. His ego goes to her lustful truth instead of focusing on his own pathetic actions of the pass. The virus is deep. so deep they changed the name and added a number on it to defy roman rule of word. That right,  I am.
Best Wishes Ashton! Ben is that a Watford/Kelme snood you had on?? Very interested in them Do you know if the shop sell them?
Stay strong, wish you all the best, Ashton. Zoltan from Hungary

Everybody know that he has a great future in his football career, espesially he is very very young (even younger than me). And i hope God always be with him. And i'd love to win this Rashford shirt giveaway, because i am a United fan and his fan. I love him not only because of his playing style, but what has he done to kids in United Kingdom as well. He deserve to win an award.  Once again, i hope Ashton will get well soon. And i hope i am also win this giveaway. Love you, Ben.

Fun Fact: Ben Foster actually played with current Utd coaches Darren Fletcher and Michael Carrick during his time at the club as well as with Luke Shaw at the 2014 World Cup with England. He also played alongside Paul Pogba in Man Utds U23s side where he was managed by none other than the current gaffer Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.

If Ashton’s doctors are half as good as Ben is a GK and all round legend, he’ll be fit and back on the pitch in no time. Stay strong young man.   Bachmann deserves his opportunity too, he had a decent loan spell with Kilmarnock.

Hi Ben, great shout out to Ashton. Can I suggest that you give the Rashford shirt to him. It would be such a nice gesture, I am sure those subscribed and following you would all prefer that as opposed to getting the top themselves.  Take care.

Since you have started your channel I now look for Watford’s score before my team of 40 years! Man Utd 🙈 didn’t have too today 👌
I’m not aloud instagram what a shame
stay strong Ashton matey
My dad works on the cameras at football matches and he spotted Ben coming into the ground with his go pro!
Wanted to see u play mate even thought I’m a Man U fan
Can I have the rashford shirts please
Who gave you the other Man Utd shirt ? Was it lingard ?
Get well soon Ashton! <3
please give me the shirt im a diehard manchester united fan and im 12 years old
Can I have this please I would love to give it to my grandad he’s 70 years old and a life long United fan he would love this he loves rashford  Like so my grandad has a chance of winning
Ben, quick question, is the giveaway only for UK followers?
let's be honest , we were all heartbroken when we saw the lineups and ben wasn't starting
Not surprised he got lingards shirt and didn’t give it away. Somethings are too legendary to give to someone else
8:24 Mctominay looking confused i was creasing for almost 2 min its just funny
Get well soon Ashton, ill see u when I can u little legend, or when u come into training with the u14 to come and see ur coaches

Correct me if I’m wrong but a coach at Manchester United put me on a diet plan and told me the day before any game day no dairy as it makes you lethargic? Any truth in this and the reason I’m asking is I presume custard has milk ?
Can’t lie I can’t believe you didn’t start, the content would’ve been ace. Loving the vids Ben👍🏻
Hi Ashton, I hope you will get well soon. I know you are going to make it. You are a bloody legend!!!
Hey Ashton Colin here Liverpool fan and now part time Watford fan thanks to Ben -  been told how great you our and me and the Liverpool lads wish you all the best - as Ben said your a legend. Xx

Amazing
Everyone was sad when they saw your not starting
Beast I was waiting for this game vs your old club
2 days ago I never knew about Ben Fosters podcasts. Now I’ve watched them all and even have notifications turned on and watched this as soon as it came on. What’s happened to me since lockdown? I’ve completed Netflix and half way through you tube now. What a guy, I love all the content. Such a nice guy, not sure about the tomato ketchup fetish mind you, lol. No Will Hughes though today?
This is such bingeable content, love it !
another great vid Ben nice to hear you giving Bachman your full support 3 points home to huddersfield please
Well done Ben lovely message to Ashton aswell 👍🏻
sad to hear about Ashton, hope you get better and, you and your family are in my prayers🙏🙏 get well soon buddy💙💙
Get well soon Ashton, stay positive young man x
Cmon united

We all cried when he wasn’t in the 11
Rashford is my idol so If I don’t get that shirt imma cry
I’m a United fan and I was scared when I saw Sarr on the starting XI Watford played amazing I was waiting for this video😃😃😃
Best of luck Ashton keep fighting mate ❤️
Ashton, I'm praying for you. You're a hero. Remember that
I send my best wishes to Ashton get well soon
Another great video. I think you should give Rashford’s shirt to the little Crewe fan Ashton. As much as I want I will still find a way to get it to Ashton cause it would mean the world to him I’m sure
