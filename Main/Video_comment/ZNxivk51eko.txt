The full interview is not available in the UK. What a shame :(
Speak Harry, Speak your truth
Tonight? or Next Sunday?
#SHUTUPHARRY
Why isn't J.R Moehringer, the pulitzer prize ghostwriter, included in any interview.  Was is the NDA he had to sign or the fact that he "liked" a tweet that criticized Harry's revelation boasting about killing 25 Talibans?
Next.  Meg’s book
He and Anderson Cooper are the same in some ways, one sided and quick to judge when they themselves should be judged.
I wonder if this is again someone else’s home where they shot the interview
Harry is a man-child puppet . He needs to grow some testitles.
Taliban accuses Prince Harry of murdering 35-30 Taliban like chess pieces 😮.   The British Military are angry with him to broken the 4 military secrets. 😱 His family is in risk for bad comments 😮
So Anderson Cooper you really consider yourself to be a responsible and professional journalist? Questions handed to you with prepared and rehearsed answers? Why did you do this? cant be the money we all know what you are worth so why do this to your career? Gone are the days of REAL journalists who would ask the hard follow up questions so we the public could get some truth. shame on you.
What’s next? Dance with the star?
This coming from an individual who once proudly wore a swastika. Harry is just grasping for straws and attention. He needsto go away.
Rather than sideline Harry, Charles should be more magnanimous and include Harry.  It will strengthen his monarchy.  William comes across as angry and Harry was the more fun brother.  It will benefit William to have Harry on his side.  It’s the right step for an older brother and father to take whatever hurt they may carry.
#HarryAndMeghan speak more #truth, to the embarrassment of the royal family.   “Don’t start none; won’t be none!” The bigotry gas apparently been unbearable for sometime. #HarryAndMeghan speak more #truth, to the embarrassment of the royal family.   “Don’t start none; won’t be none!” The bigotry has apparently been unbearable for sometime.
They should fix their own lives before they attempt to reform anyone else.  They’re a mess.
Love how Everyone forgets how they murdered Diana I would be angry too if I was him
Love you Harry   Good on you tell the world how ROTTEN THEY ARE ❤
I loved the part where he could speed dial a therapist for a brotherly bust up, but not for his wife who wanted to unalive herself. So thoughtful
Ask him about the money he is making by exposing his hate of not being the heir.
Wait, what's that? Oh. it's the sound of Mike Wallace rolling over in his grave.
Privacy is tough with all this planned media 😳
CAN YOU ALL JUST STOP BEING SO CRUEL. There are murderers rapists thieves etc yet you bash this couple as if they are worse than criminals. YOU ALL SERIOUSLY NEED TO CHECK YOURSELVES. You are all as imperfect as these two. Why make so much effort to hate on them.
Matthew 12:36-37 ESV  I tell you, on the day of judgment people will give account for every careless word they speak, for by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.”  You all need to stop being so CRUEL
I remember when 60 Minutes covered real stories. Wow.
I am so tired of everyone saying Harry lost his mother at such a young age. Harry is not the only one to lose a mother at a young age. Millions of children lose their mother even younger and have to go to their mother's funeral. Harry is not more special that all those other children. He needs to man up and start acting like an adult. He cannot keep using his mother's death as an excuse for his bad behavior.
We all thought Harry and William were close.  Now we know Harry was always angry and jealous of William's position in the family. Once he found Meghan who willingly fed his ego and made him feel powerful he started his antics and his hate for his brother is now coming out. He has said that he and Meghan are bigger than Kate and William that he and Meghan do the job better than the one that was born to do thee job. Harry is classic example of cane and able.  Is Harry a narcissist
As I have said in the past Harry is not happy William will be King. He thinks he should be king. He is jealous. Harry used Meghan to help him do his dirty work. Meghan will one day tire of him and his whining and leave him and she will tell all that Harry physically abused her.  At the moment Harry cannot leave Meghan because Meghan will tell all about Harry's abusive behavior. Meghan is also using Harry to get worldwide fame.  Their marriage will not last as it is built on contention, chaos and drama, once the drama against the Royals end they will turn on each other and their relationship with implode.
Oh ! My brother pushed me !! Boohoo! I wonder how many other ways he’s gonna try and milk this. Afternoon tv maybe.
Thank you @60 Minutes Australia. First time the man is left alone for a second, I'm glad he can talk freely, he seems oppressed and monitored all the time and she doesn't let him talk much. Glad we can avoid all the 12 year old hand holding obsession and the way she controls him with her hands and eyes constantly.
Do you trust the 'institution' who protected Prince Andrew? OR Do trust someone who speak out against this 'institution'?
It's goin down ,!!!!!!!
I love the part where racists royal supporters go against a royal who stands up and protects his wife and family.
Boke
I love all parts ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Harry's comment that neither his father nor his brother have intended to reconcile is just again him whining and covering exactly what he is requesting from his dad and brother. The word reconciliation in his dictionary is just a cover up word for again more whining that himself and Meghan expect apologies from the royal family... Harry and Meghan are two neurotics, why would Charles, William or any other royalty want anything to do with narcisists. Glad the British Royal Family is going on doing their things and ignore the whining of Harry and Meghan.
Did Harry apply for the US greencard or did he renew the rent of Frogmore Cottage so he can evade filing for the US tax return showing he is still residing in the UK?
Well eventually he will run out of ways to make money …. 😢 it’s sad that  he has done this.  Hopefully once they told their side they can be quiet and go away.
still a Prince?
Harry...you're a loser and a liar
`i do hope that Anderson arranged for someone to bring Harry some kind of nasal congestion remedy. He seems to have a rather frequent nasal problem accompanied by red eyes yet no one has had the concern to help him.
Harry has become a narcissistic con.  He's banking on this book portraying him to the world as an international leader and thinker.  He has no gratitude for the privedges he has been given in life.  The ONLY reason the Invictus Games came together for him was with the full support and backing of William's Foundation and the Royal Family's soft power in Europe and the Commonwealth nations. NO OTHER NON-HEIR PRINCE WAS EVER GIVEN SUCH OPPORTUNITIES.  Because of the tragic loss of Diana, Charles and Wm have been enormously kind and nurturing to him all his life.  Between the netflix reality series and this book, the world now sees the true Harry.  I'm sure the Invictus Games Foundation must be worried on how support might change going forward.
I love the part where Harry talks about how much he hates the "institution" and yet continues to milk it for every cent he can.
More of the same moaning about being privileged, no doubt
It's so hilarious that he keeps talking about planting stories and leaks when he and Meghan are the biggest leakers there is! And when they planted the train story after the queen died H&M quickly "leaked" that story to their favorite mouthpiece Omid Scabies! Harry needs to learn that the more he whinges and trashes his family, the more the people are going to dislike him. He's a bully and he's bullying his family and everyone hates a bully!!!!
I liked Anderson but now, can't believe he fell for these too.
I love the part where you can se his big pupils telling us that he is on something, sadly it is not the truth but something else.
A la Alec Baldwin…Meghan and Harry A-B-C “Always Be Complaining”
Can someone teach this guy to get a real job ? Attend interview and get a job that you are qualified for. Is not that difficult even though I think he has too little options to consider due to is education qualifications or technical skills … maybe telenovela actor ?
Families are messy. You have to be willing to compromise so everyone wins which is hard to do. I got into a fight with my sister who wouldn’t compromise. I don’t like to argue so I gave her a choice split the inheritance or you can have it all but lose me in the process. She chose the money. I thought she had the same love and respect that I had for her. I was wrong. If you truly love someone you feel the hurt when they are gone. I am still feeling that hurt. Relationships matter to me more than money. I gave my inheritance to my sister to prove that point. I lost her in that process. I realized that people who aren’t willing to  sacrifice just a little bit of themselves for the good of others are not worth having in ones life. Harry left a country who adored him called it a freedom flight called them racially biased against his wife and said his brother bullied him out of the Royal family. Harry took the money and ran. He did this all so  people would buy his book and we would make him King of the US? Why? NOT BUYING IT OR THE BOOK!
Please do not call this an "interview".  It is nothing more than a pre-approved questions and rehearsed PR puff piece about Saint Harry against the evil monarchy.  Disappointed that Anderson Cooper would associate with this tosh.
I love the part where Anderson Cooper realizes Harry can't do this on his own and starts answering all the questions for him.
The best way to patch up relations with your family is to constantly attack them in the media, tell lies about them, ignore invitations to visit them and air all their dirty laundry in public. A "mental health advocate" like Harry knows this.
I love the part where Harry always complains but never explains! Very generic complaints, yet never giving true instances. Throwing the family under the bus yet not revealing a thing. One would only do this because they are lying! Protecting himself from being sued for slander! And Anderson whatever happened to journalism? Spreading woke propaganda, pathetic!
The hypocrisy is almost unbelievable. He accuses the family of not  wanting to reconcile, but neither him or Meghan are willing to reconcile with Meghans father, who recently had a severe stroke btw. Her brother said she has not reached out to her dad at all after the stroke. They also have been refusing several invitations to Christmas at Sandringham. The Queen invited them to Balmoral the week she died. They were in the UK and still didn't go see her. Harry thinks he can tell us his narrative without people remembering the facts. They think we are stupid. They are not victims, it's their behavior that keeps the royal family away from them and people continuing to dislike them. They left Britain because of the negative coverage they claim is " racist", but that coverage has still followed them to America with thr American media. Americans are now seeing the behaviors the British saw that caused her the negative coverage. They also leaked several stories to the press as well. MEGHAN admitted in court she had something to do with the. book Finding Freedom, but only after she lied under oath and was caught. Let's not forget the 5 friends who leaked the letter from her father to People Magazine. Then she had the nerve to say she had no idea they were going to do that??!! Oh come on, of course she had to sign off on them discussing her affairs to the public. They are delusional!
El silencio no es traición harry el silencio es elegancia por que no se le otorga a cualquier 💩
Harry que lastima me das como tendrás ese corazón lleno de rencor pudiéndolo llenar de amor y felicidad, pero no hay vas atacar a tu familia de nuevo sabes ya la humanidad te tiene como un 💩 ya caíste mal a todos
Anderson Cooper should be ashamed of himself for instigating Harry.  There is no reason to have to do a 60 minute interview after just coming out with a 6 hour Netflix docuseries about the same damn stuff
60 minutes have lowered their standards just another opportunity to bore the world with his whingefest gutter journalism no doubt American 60 minutes I won’t be watching you anymore and a lot of people feel the same way give time and interview s to people who have real public interest stories !
Heard enough of his lies and fake victim story and all the questions are pre-agreed and pre-scripted beforehand so I won’t be watching
I love the part where Harry sends an email to Knauf admitting he contributed to finding freedom but says that cannot be allowed to ever get out..because then everybody would know they ate liars.
I love the part where MeGain has to apologize to a Uk court gor lying about contributing to finding freedom, thus confirming she is the only leak in that family.
I love the part where this is supposed to be an actual interview. All the questions had to be pre approved by Harry. This is not an in depth interview this is a PR event. Disappointed in Anderson Cooper. I remember when he was an actual journalist.
39 year old teenager says everything is sooo unfair
Anderson forgot that doing The Real Housewives tell all special is Andy Cohen's job...AwKwArD😬
It’s not an interview if the questions are given to the interviewer by the interviewee. 😱😱
I wish someone would ask Henry what it's like to be called a TRAITOR!
I love the part where he copied Martin Luther King’s quote “there comes a time when silence is betrayal”……so original, so authentic …… one tear left eye
I love the part where he said he and his wife have moved on in the Netflix reality show.  Wonder what his new occupation will be after 3 years as family trasher/whiner/liar.
No matter what horrors his family inflicted on he and Meghan… it wasn’t horrific enough
A Windsor whining to a Vanderbilt
Good on him. Reveal it all but smart people already knows great deal of it. As for limited people/critics.....well it gives them something to trash talk about  😂😂
I love the part where he is saying there were too many leaks to the media. He is too simple to figure it out that it was his wife that did most of the leaking.
I will not be watching
I wish they would stop giving this idiot air time, we are sick of seeing the Ginger Whinger????
I hope Harry is happy he is amazing down to earth I have always loved him from a younger Harry
Cooper seems more like that bestie who tells a person just what they want to here...definately not journalism or debatable interview, he was the one being spoon fed...🙄
Harry won't stop until he sees the British people revolt against the monarchy. I doubt if he'll succeed.
I love the part when AC tells H to blink if he’s in trouble and needs help.
I love the part where these H&M series are turning into such a getto reality tv that never ends because the main characters have done a great job in making themselves a laughable stock!!😂😂😅
I love the part where Harry says he wants his family and not the institution while using the royal titles given by same institution he does not want for self-promotion and profit.
How do I watch this in England
Throwing your own family members under the bus while raking in tons of money from Netflix and book deals in doing so is not a good look.
He needs to flog the book hence the interview.
What a traitor to his family,country and the Crown.
Is he meant to disappear after this? Are leprechaun real? Is he a lep...?
This interview with Joffrey Baratheon is going to have some big revelations. Tears from my left eye.
Please stop bothering him, His Dukeness and Dukess want privacy and not all this media attention. And anyway - who cares anymore?
There are murders, child abuse, drugs, rape, war, global warming, hunger & homelessness going on in the world and Harry/Meghan choose to put their energy into their family feud?  Lol
60 minutes and the interviewer going tabloid!
I don’t know what is more bloody annoying, the sound of the ticking clock or more of Hazmats continuous complaining? 😡😣
Stop crying H! Lol
Why does he want his racist family back?
I love the part where Harry thinks this will help him get his father and brother back. Delusional much?
A younger brother was never in need more of a stack down 👋
I love the part where Harry looks and sounds like he is high. Also the part where Anderson helps him along by feeding him his next lines. So touching, but my left eye was out of tears.
I can’t wait! I’ve got my popcorn ready!
🤣🤪two fruits in a tree🤣🤪
Worse interview Cooper ever did. Cooper used to ask the right questions as this seems rehearsed.
So lovely to see that Meghan let you off the leash for a couple of hours. Heel boy!
Still this??? Seriously!!!  He’s got a funny way of showing he wants his father and brother back!  Yet MORE talking to the PRESS???? Didn’t Harry and Meghan tell her dad off for doing that very SAME THiNG!!!!  Most families wouldn’t want to have anything to do with a member of their family who had publicly dragged them through the mud like he has! FOR YEARS!!! Do he and his wife not realise how horrible they have been? Their spite and hatefulness towards Harry’s family has gone on for years!!!! If I was his dad or brother it would take a long time before I’d even consider having him back in my life and I’d NEVER trust him again.  Allowing his narcissist wife to MOCK his grandmother who had bone cancer at the time, while he just sat there  with a look of contempt yet says NOTHiNG to her because he’s a whipped wimp!  They have cut Meghan’s dad off for doing a LOT LESS than what those two weasels have done to Harry’s family!!!!!!!  Meghan’s dad goes to the press and talks about H&M & Meghan and Harry act like he’s dead.  Meghan and Harry go to the press and talk ON and ON and ON and ON the most awful lies about Harry’s family over and over again - and Harry can’t  understand why his family want NOTHiNG to do with him!  He’s got a lower IQ than I thought!
of course, my book will be written completely without a ghostwriter,  I can do this by myself... this is on them though,  they started it.  sorry, am in a very crazy sarcastic funny mood.  This will be a funny book, I can tell (all) you.... hahahaha.   just kidding, if you must know. 😆😁😂
I love the part where harry tells the truth.. again of course
I am going to write my memoirs too since I need money... I have none, literally none. lol.
Everybody who is against Harry and Meghan telling their story publicly, has no right to educate any children or anyone else at all. You shall lose all your custory.
Anderson Cooper is very confident in the way he carries himself and looks like a prince. Prince Harry looks lost and miserable and doesn't look royal in any way.  Won't it be stressful to be in so many interviews? I thought he wanted a quiet, peaceful life.
Dear God, can you bring back Prince from the dead in exchange for this ginger.
I love Harry and Meghan...He is right to do what he is doing..telling the true about the Royal family and how they manipulate the media and YOU.He is protecting his family..good for him
Anderson sold out
Unless 60 minutes actually has any integrity by asking hard hitting questions, not going to watch. You're so critical of other people but suddenly you're cozying up with a lying man child? Meh.
I hope there are hard hitting questions. I hope it is not just another soft soap interview. Getting real answers not just the narrative they want to put out to the world.
Please Harry enlighten us about the leaked and planted stories by the palace. Would it be The time Meghan left a Royal engagement in Fiji in a hissy fit less than 5 minutes from arrival prompting an aid to resign. Or Meghan trowing tea around the place on your Australian Royal tour? Or might it be that Meghan spent over 1 Million pounds in clothes, equating to more than all other Royal Women in the UK and Europe combined?? Or might it be when she splashed out 58'000 pounds on her engagement dress for a photo session Or when she wore a dress that cost over 100'000 pounds on her Royal visit to Morrocco? Or when she wore blood diamonds twice Or would it be when she thought it would be a great idea to hop on a private jet to New York for a baby shower that cost over half a million pounds Or would it be when you and Harry decided to lecture us mere mortals about our travels and holidays and preach about climate change when hopping on 11 private jets in the space of 2 weeks??? Or might it be when you lied about Archie's birth??? Or when you lied in the British Court of law about the book Finding Freedom?? What do all these stories have in common??? They all happened in the public domain. The public and the media picked up on YOUR BAD AND HYPOCRITICAL BEHAVIOUR and started calling you out and reporting on it. Buckingham palace didn't need to plant or leak anything. What did you expect The Palace and the Royal Family do to "protect you". LIE AND COVER UP for you and your wife's bad behaviour??? Buckingham palace actually tried to spin a few of these instances and explain themselves. Even Sunshine Sachs has given up covering and lying on your behalf Let this be clear: People and the media turned on you because of your BEHAVIOUR. BUCKINGHAM PALACE DIDN'T NEED TO LEAK OR PLANT ANYTHING. YOU DID THIS ALL BY YOURSELVES
Ho no hear we go again and Anderson Cooper fell in to there trap moan moan and moan some more about how a rich prince left and how daddy cut him off ! Are you kidding me ? No wonder the Royal Family stopped taking calls so would I.  If I was any news group that had a bit of sense I would show them the door . Unless you are part of there agenda to bring down the British Royals?   From Glasgow uk
“Explosive” new memoir?  I wonder who pays the media to put out this nonsense.
I love the part where 60 minutes loses all credibility and plummets in ratings just like Oprah did when she allowed H and M to spew lies unchecked. Either do it properly or just shut up.
Prince  who
My husband doesn't really care about the Royal Family, and we don't discuss things I see/watch on YouTube about them. However, last night, we caught a glimpse of Harry on the news, saying he wanted his dad back. First thing the husband said, "ah whats up,  things not working out, running out of money?". !!!!!!!!
More from the boy that wants his privacy
I can't wait to buy and read Prince Harry's $36.00 + tax new family memoir.
I love that Harry is going full scorched earth. Reminds me of Daenerys in the Game of Thrones finale with her dragon burning down all of King’s Landing. He doesn’t care who he burns or who goes down. The royals must be terrified. And they should be.
Enough already please make it stop ✋️
60 minutes with harry  - 976 likes / 13k dislikes Netflix harry & meghan - 23k likes / 253k dislikes all for the hate views
The same-o-samo 😩Poor me 😢Poor Me-gain 😭Poor Me-again True Story The End
Anderson: What's your relationship like with your family? Harry: It's space
I just love the part where he sticks to the Markle script and doesn't realise he's using someone else's quote. she is managing to ridicule him and the whole world knows it except him. A tear is squeezed from my left eye at the embarrassment of it all.
Without these tell all interviews, reality TV shows, and booka they don't have any means of income to support their wannabe billionaire lifestyle
I love the part where Anderson looks like he might actually believe Harry! Just asking but is this an Andy Cohen spoof of 60 Minutes? Seems the most likely answer. Congratulations Andy, so much more ironic than Housewives!
Princess Diana:  "Harry's a brat when he can't get his own way".  Man, you weren't kidding Diana  He's turned into a whipped clown too.
Is Harry still abusing drugs and alcohol to self medicate his mental illness?
🙄🙄🙄
Whining to encourage book sales. Par for the course. His mother did quite a lot with her wealth and prestige, Harry seems to have missed that memo.
"I want an FAMILY, not an institution"
Love the part where Anderson Cooper asks for specific examples and proof of all these dastardly deeds done to Harry and Meghan. Oh wait. No, didn’t think so.
I love the part where Harry speaks and my insomnia is cured. 😴
Por cierto, mi amada y brillante esposa cambio el mundo con su carta a la empresa de lavatrastes y gracias a ella el mundo de la publicidad misógina cambio!!
I love the part where Harry says stories were leaked to the press but forgets how many stories he has leaked to Gayle King and Omid Scobie
I love the part where Howard Stern tells Anderson Cooper: hold my beer.
most boring 60 minutes of 2023 inc....
I love the part where the Royal Family ratings went up.
Harry is trying to gaslight everyone.  Don't forget that the were secretly developing the Royal Sussex website to launch in 2020 in order to commercialize their titles.  They even tried to put a trademark on Sussex Royal.  This was all unknownst to the Queen and SHE put a stop to it and firmly said you're in or you're out.  That's why William went ballistic and called Harry out on the total disrespect to the Queen, his Father and the Monarchy.  I applaud William for his moral compass.
Go ahead Anderson … soil your reputation further by aiding these fools like Oprah did. Might spend some time checking out those who have proven the fraud.  They’re all over the internet
I love the part where he tells the truth. Oh wait it's the Markle show truth is like hens teeth.   Harry well done for using the only media outlet that showed pictures of your mother dying in the back of the car. She would be so proud of you for using her death for financial game.
Harry…prince of lies
There was no need for a book interview yes but not book
So sick of these two constantly whining and complaining about family, media, blah blah blah.  People in wars and the homeless don’t even complain as much as these two. 🙄
Please stop! How long is this going to drag out?
Hearing "MEGAN" WE KNOW THE UGLY TRUTH "JAMACIA" DROPPED THE ROYALS AS SHOULD HAVE, HOW MANY "MONKEYS" HAVE THEY BEEN CALLED BY THE COWARDS "ROYAL FAMILY MY JAŹZZZZŹ
Well good on him, you get one life and he has every right to live it as he chooses as well express himself how he wants. William should also live his and tell his story how he wants or not. Free will and all that !
I love the part when the wife has spent every dime of his inheritance and dads going away cash and their media earning and now dude can’t even get a pair of pants that fit for his one of a handful of engagements he had in 2-3 yrs. the shoe lifts he’s rocked since mtg her mean his hems need lowered the evil men working the institution used to take care of those small details for him. Meghan loves him so much she doesn’t notice but she did notice his height difference to his older brother (shoe lifts) and the fact he was balding (hairplugs the thinned kinkier hair on the top plot of this dudes now completely empty head. It’s now just visceral the state of him these are effects of Narc ABUSE and 60 Min and ITV have given it a pass allowing this on their platform. All media have a responsibility to the public and I do hope both interviews are followed up with or started with the disclaimer of Spousal Abuse Hotlines and Sucide Hotlines because this man is trapped and If  he was a female this never would’ve gone this far.
😔😫🤮🤮🤮🤮
I love the part where Harry and Meghan make hundreds of millions off of the weirdos who can never shut up about them 😂
Very sad that Anderson Cooper and 60 minutes would even do this interview I thought they were a reputable show and interviewer. I guess not I will no longer be tuning in. just after ad money.
For all those saying no.2 is so much like DIANA, of course he is, like William, but, Diana got on with  life, charity work, got her own life, she had it tough, ( please no hecklers) she did an interview, but she didn't make her life about Woe is me,   every 5 minutes, selling everyone out, for MONEY, British pounds,  DIANA would be shocked, disappointed,  disgusted, the split between William & harry, his father, the Spencer's, BRITAIN, slagging the British people, & Where did it all come from, someone who Discarded her family,  told lies, still lying, can't even tell the truth about the SURROGATES for those 2 children, & there was NO MISCARRIAGE HENRY, you've been had, but you're now on the bandwagon of LIES, WHATEVER!!!
Queen Elizabeth Rip always stated that she was a servant to the people.  Same for King Charles and Prince William.  Harry and his whining wife want to be celebrities and want to live the life of a celebrity, they do not want to be servants, they continuously want to condemn the Royal Family and make their money off their royal connections and it's working, because the dim public pay to watch their ridiculous reality show on  Netflix and buy their books, they may as well just hand over their well earned money directly over to Harry and his wife, who are actually famous for nothing!  Plus the media encourages all this with all the attention they are giving them! It's now 2023 so let's just ignore these two spoilt upstarts!  Maybe then, the media will lose interest!
I don’t believe a word Harry is saying . It’s all the words that Meg allows him to say. Harry is Megs puppet.
I’ll never watch this news station again. Your allowing a liar to influence people with Harry. I’ll not ever listen to Anderson Cooper again either. I’m not in UK I’m US.
He and Meghan need help, seriously. Just stop this now, it’s ridiculous and hurtful, life is too short. Harry should know this more than anybody, I feel he will regret all this one day. Such a shame…William and he were so close…this is not the life he was meant for.
Harry Markle must really be hard up for the money. STILL airing his dirty linen in public!?!?!? He and Sparkles are kind of one-trick ponies — they have nothing else to offer. He’s not very bright and she’s desperate to use him for all she can to get the mileage out of him for fame. Gotta keep those flat-iron treatments up. Diana would be so ashamed of him and see her for the gold digger she is. You married the wrong woman if she has caused trouble between not only ALL of her family members sand former friends but also YOURS too. Her natural state is conflict. Mr. Thomas Markle is too good for his trash daughter. It’s sad, because in the end, she will walk away with at least half of Diana’s money. She smuggled herself into the palace and boy did she make out with half the sliver or what? Maybe one of the most successful social climbers in history. She’ll be set for life on Keratin treatments, when this is all said and done. 😂
Could this interview put Anderson’s reputation  on line like Oprah’s? I hope not!  What  we see so far Harry’s narrative seems to be  facteless- they but doesn’t say who are they- family or courtiers. He says Buckingham  Palace- so classic of him- paint with wide brush stroke.
The palace and family would of known at this interview also
60 minutes no longer has journalistic integrity.
They made sure they hid Andrews stuff  but that was for the sake of all
Same old stuff just stop talking get on with your new life and new famiky
You just know Meghan will insert herself into a surprise guest appearance.
I would love to see him do an interview with an actual journalist, answering real questions.
Two Soy Boys just talkin'.
I love you Harry ❤
Here comes the traitor again.
I love the part where it ends.
I love the part where Harry continually makes vague accusations without evidence and Anderson questions are approved and as useless as Ophra.  Goodbye credibility
MM is the leak!! To cause division.  True to her Narcissism
"get father back"  does not mean as family... he means to take out his vengeance.
Now Harry uses the media because he hates the media ??? In his own words, they wanted to leave for 2 years. It’s all planned and they are cashing in big time.
Please ‼️  Harry and Meaghan are embarassing
Exactly Harry. They briefed against you and your wife for six years and now that you are defending yourself they want you to shut up. People say what about the other side of the story, you literally heard the other side for the past six years while HandM were not allowed to respond. If you want to hear the other side go listen to what the royal rota has been spewing for the past 5 years.
It’s all about money! That’s the bottomline!
Why is the Scream guy narrating this?
Anderson is the best white privileged journalist of all time. Since he couldn't rag on the orange man anymore, he chose to dump on the Royal family with his petty interview with white privileged Hairball, whining how he was wronged. Hairball has no skills ; does he even know how to use Excel?
Omg can't they just knock it off and deal with their issues in the privacy of their own lives? Oh wait... no because they actually DO LIKE attention. Ahh.
STRIP THOSE TITLES FOR THE LOVE OF GOD
Love the part where Markle says airline crew member took off his hat and thanked her for her service to UK, when Harry was still thrashing out deal at Sandringham and it wasn't clear that they were not serving UK and Air Canada crew don't wear hats.... They are the 2 most truthful people on this planet and 2 lies in one sentence is no big deal...brought a tear to my left eye...
Harry is a liar. Looking for money and telling tails to get the big payoff. I hope Parliament doesn't take away his precious title.
🙄🤮💩
Everyone betrayed Harry but Harry
Oh! Harry’s got some new information for us?!? 🤣🤣🤣
Anderson should interview some family member across the pond or it’s only another Oprah interview, not sided!  Dan Wootton has some interesting things to challenge Harry about Anderson.   He’s a journalist.
Something is going 🤔 on that we the people don't know
The ex prince and his soon to be ex wife, are just tireless. The Netflix  mockumentary was a failure, Me-again “book” for children was a failure, people in UK booed them back in the jubilee, they’re down falling on popularity rankings, even the woke NYT is tired of them but they keep on insisting! My God! Enough! This is just too much! It has been only 3 days of 2023! Have mercy and leave us alone!!
Harry has shown to me that he believes in his own lies of being betrayed by his own family and that his family hates him. He is so consumed with jealousy that he could not accept his lower status in the perking order and that William, and his family are ahead of him. He said that the royal family will protect William before him and why shouldn't it be so, as he is lower in the perking order?  He is upset that there is a hierarchy in the royal family and that is strange as there is thearchy everywhere, even in communist countries, which have the manifesto that all are equal. Now Harry will never be happy that there are people above him and therefore should not be accepted back as it is impossible for the monarchy to exist without the hierarchy.  Harry would be happy if he was at the top of the hierarchy. He cannot attain it unless he kills off William and his family and so I believe that Harry should not be accepted back.
Oh gosh. Here we go. More whining. I am so SICK of this loser and husband equally loser lying weird wife.
I lost all respect for the royal family.   Throwing your own son under the bus for self promotion? That’s not a king who is a leader.  It’s a silly old man in a bejeweled hat.   I support Harry and his quest to become a healthy functioning person.  This has to be very painful to get thru.   Probably couldn’t do it without Meghan.  And his mother in law.  Who seems like a rock. Thank you for sharing your story.
Does 60 min know that no one really cares about this pathetic complaining couple?
Too bad the woke media doesn't realize Crybaby Harry and Megalomaniac have nothing to offer but lies and feeling sorry for themselves.  The R.F. are doing what they have always done work and mind their own business. The RF was good to Crybaby and Megalomaniac.
🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴
I love the part where Harry thinks if he can just say it to us all one more time, then we will believe him. 🤡
Complain, complain, complain!
You turned on your family for the greed of money. Because you have no other talents to make money! We are sick of you and your wife whining every minute!!!!
I love the fact that Meghan spent all Diana's inheritence money to buy One house the same size as first black Billionaire filmmaker Tyler Perry's
60  Minutes of Hawwy. Not ever again, I cannot take either of their voices after the past few years of constant moaning.
Zzzzzzz
The UK and the Queen deserve more respect then this!
Shame on you for putting out PROPAGANDA!!!!
CNN and 60 minutes is FAKE news.
Anderson Cooper is a fraud.
I will never listen to Anderson Cooper or CNN ever again.
Go live your quiet life and shut your mouth please!
Oh no…. Please….no more dribbling & boring poor-me’s from these two privileged elites, obviously bored with jetting around the world burning up tonnes of fuel & life in the mansion with it’s private beach.  The call for 💰reigns supreme I guess to keep them in luxury. No more, please.
Spare us, Spare.
The Markles are like watching an annoying trainwreck.
I’d rather watch paint dry…….
I love the part where Harry hates the paparazzi but thinks the other forms of exploitive media can help him. 😂
When will you ever stop Harry from profiting from your family?  Your story is getting so annoying with all the very real problems of this world you are simply tone deaf!
Cant wait to watch this comedy 60 Minutes should rename this " Harry the prince complaining for a zillion time for a a paycheck" I think I have his story memorized by now. He is  starting to look like a dang fool GOing to get my popcorn maybe i can repeat his stories at the same time Harry interviews   HOw many times has harry complained Netflix oprah his book now interviews Harry go away we memorized your poor Harry and MEaghan story .Get a real job!
Just don’t watch it. The less views he gets, the less money he’ll be offered to do these interviews.
Is the lie about they got married 3 days before they actually got married in the interview i bet not and he just sat there and never said megan we never did harry your a 💩💩💩💩 bag
BREAKING   NEWS.... " PITY PARTY" ...... Book has made it to the   U  Rated  list  ..Congratulation   , you must be so proud 🤣🤣🤣
Give me 3 seconds, left eye one tear GO 😢
Anderson : the things I do for this job *pushes journalistic integrity out the window*
Wow, a brand new year but the same old BS. Imagine when the day comes that they need to talk about something else? How groundbreaking that will be. He used to be every girls dream, now he’s just a beta male with a witch for a wife.
😂😂 comedy special next Sunday 😅
Did you hear about the AWARD they just got????  FINALLY they got an award they didn’t have to buy…and one they deserve.  Megaliar got #1.  Most disliked person BabyBoy got.  #2  RIGHT ON!!!!    Saw the show but don’t know who was responsible for it.  Was legit.  Others on the list included    Amber Herd,   Kayne west,    Ellen, ….can’t remember rest, but was thrilled     Megaliar and Baby Boy got the top two spots!!!
"Lets", not forget how Megan is on Record with a UK court for forgetting emails she exchanged with an aide who was going to brief the authors of an unauthorized biography ... Megan had  “no intention to mislead” the court. But she did  ..!!!!!!! Why she had to apologized to a UK court..  How  can anyone  Believe this pair  when all  ready been  proven  she lies.
Its amazing how many people know what went on in Harry's family. If asked to give testimony of your evidence most would get ghosted.
I bet it was ok when the Monarchy buried any of Ms not so good moments from her past or didn't explain why none of her immediate or extended  family  or friends were at the wedding or why any footage of her past except Suits is gone. That PR machine was good when it suited their agenda. Why from 2016 until 2018 M & H never met her father even before the so called BS letters. More complaining and explaining to be a  victim. Go get a real job Harry. Corporations have hierarchy and rules. You and the 72 day working Royal wife didn't like the word NO you can't monetise the Monarchy for personal financial gain.
Prince Harry May God almighty keep you and ur family safe from those evil reporters in London 🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿
Boycott that clown's telling lies book
The man he has become a mi$erable angry liar and grifter
That clown is plagiarized Martin Luther King Jr. - “a time comes when silence is betrayal” (Declaration Against Vietnam War) in his pathetic scripted "borrowed" lines. But LIES about family is OK
Watch YouTube - according 2taz, recollections may very. She’s from Sussex and does a fantastic job covering H&M. It’s so clear how truly disgusting these two are.
Was award winning... this is just not news but Gossip.
Oh, dear!  Will save that tear in my left eye for Sunday then!  Hope some asks the baby if he is okay.
Harry, you need to grow up and stop being led by both your bulls (in Meghan's grasp).  Stop airing your family issues in public, and stop whining.  Get a job that doesn't involve throwing your family under the bus!
I love the part when nobody buys his book but himself.
Worried that Anderson Cooper isn't asking Harry the hard questions and just letting him talk nonsense.
No American cares please tell me more how you grew up rich and life was unfair so interesting 😂
Gag-fest 😅🤮
I am disgusted with the fact that Harry NEVER mentions  anything specific and  only generalizes accusations against the his family.   I've yet to hear anything  worthy of the money paid to these traitors.
Here's a first: he's doing something/anything without Meghan!!! No Meghan to clutch/grab his hand or arm the whole time!!!
I VERY VERY LOVE PRINCE HARRY AND HIS FAMILY
One's "version of events may vary". He came to the US to sell his lies because his wife told him Americans love BS and will pay millions for it. Cry the race card and quadruple the loot.
We love you Harry and Meghan
Everyone should mind their own backyard. All I see in these comments are jealousy and ignorance.
He was once a very eligible, dashing Prince, then he is deduced to just "Harry" and now is only "H". I'm sorry to say, but Haz got had.
Hey Harry...don't go away Mad, just Go Away! Pleeease!!
Nice to start a new year with some light comedy Need a good laugh after a miserable 2022
Oh look, they're twinning.
Love watching a grow man interviewing a child adult throwing a tantrum over Problems he created trying to make it all seem serious
Harry what a liar . And Anderson Cooper yeah Oprah 2.0
Nice!
Oh honey. Just stop. Millions are in genuine suffering and you’re whining about your family for the tenth time. Get a real job and do some actual good.
Sure doesn't look like he's suffering! Narcissist making money trashing his own family. My opinion
I hope Anderson had asked tough questions. That spoilt brat, who sold his family, needs some kind of a pushback. His public tantrum needs to end. Also, can somebody take away his titles, so he can stop cashing in?
Thanks for the warning. Another great reason NOT to watch that program.
Quit watching 60 minutes years and years ago, and certainly will not watch this episode of Harry whining and whining.  Sick of those two, they need to go back to Canada...
829 likes.  8,000 dislikes. 🤣🤣
Did you ask the right question Mr Anderson? I hope so?
I love the part where Harry realises that if he bought himself a little ginger toupee to wear, his life would be so much better.
Interview with Anderson Cooper is in Anderson’s role as a cbs 60 minute correspondent not the CNN news person.  CNN and CBS 60 minutes have different standards.  CBS is the network that Gail King is affiliated with, and Oprah has been in the past an occasional special correspondent for CBS 60 minutes.  This might explain the choice of the interviewer, by trying to rely on Cooper’s CNN hard journalist reputation but being indirectly connected to Oprah and Gail.  So look at this with that in mind.
Poor Mr. Cooper! It must be very challenging to interview a man with higher social status and limited IQ. I hope he got paid well by CBS for doing this interview, to compensate the metal damage he suffered from doing this interview.
After seeing the trailer, I doubt this interview will be revealing...just more of the same allegations with any proof offered.
Not them again.  What is it now.  Can’t you two talk to each other in private.  Nobody is bothering you or bothered about you.
He slams hus dad and brother cause they will not keep him on the payroll for be a non working royal but wants his dad and brother back after all this dirt he throwing? Nothing is sticking.
I won't be watching these interviews -  I've got something more interesting to watch - some drying paint. 😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄
I will be boycotting this obvious attempt to help peddle unsubstantiated claims.  Prince Harry and Meghan look like petulant children.  If you think it’s racism like they claim, watch Pdina, Nat the lawyer, and several other African Americans who have investigated the claims and pointed out the inconsistency in the Netflix and Oprah interview
Is it not a bit disingenuous that we see the number of positive ‘thumbs up’, but not the ‘thumbs down’ ? Could you explain the reasoning for this please? I have no idea why you would want to hide our opinions?
This guy needs help
Dam,Harry looks good 👍,
Harry reminds me of a talking parrot who repeat the same words over and over again. In the end the sound of the parrot is just unbearable...
Spare us Harry!
Do you all think Anderson will do a good job asking good questions or will he be biased like Oprah?
The  Ginger  & the whinger’ are at it again  ,with the begging bowl Please . read my book  called " Pity party". is all about my life . How I am a Victim and been treated  growing  up in a palace.  "Why you the common fork do not know what hardship is   ." Get a life." !!!!!!! ... Do not want be apart of the Royal family  but want still use the Titles to plug everything . There no going back for Harry or Meghan . They are finished  in the Uk And  they both know this
I love the part that Harry has avoided the paparazzi so far
I love the part where Silence is Betrayal but Selling Lies About Your Family (Without Receipts) is Okay.
He needs to be addressed as harry  boy. More appealing to him too he will love that.. ❤
This is turning into harassment I feel like
I love the part how clearly mentally ill humans are exploited for profit by the malfeasance of the media lol - enjoy getting markled lol
😂😂😂😂😂
I love the part where he says he wants his father and brother back but goes out of his way to trash talk them. Honestly it's the same woe is me narrative. It's been 3 years since Megxit. Tell Harry to move on and stop whining already. 60 Minutes is going to go easy on Haz.
Why didn't Anderson Cooper do his job as journalist and ask Harry for his proof?
What an absolute loon 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
We can’t trust either Harry or Megan when it’s been proven that they play fast and loose with “the truth.” Personally I’m going to buy Harry’s book SPARE and use it to wipe my bottom because it’s going to be full of S—T,
How many times will he mention Princess Diana? Dear Andy: get you interjections ready. WAT!?? WHAAAAT??? WHAAAAAAAATTTTTTT!!!!!!!!!!!
Harry at the psychiatrist office:    Week 1.    "It never needed to be this way."                                     Can you perhaps reflect on how you may have contributed? Week 2.     "I want a family, not an institution."                                     Tell me more about your dependency on the institution of mass media in regards to family.  Week 3.     "They feel as though it's better to keep us somehow as the villains."                                    Let’s talk about a term we use in psychology called “projection” Week 4.      "The leaking, and the planting..."                                     Do you find any similarities here to stories you’ve given in the news and media about your family?                             Week 5.     "I would like to get my father back. I would like to have my brother back."                                     Talk about how you perceive the notion of adult choices having consequences. Week 6.    "They've shown absolutely no willingness to reconcile."                                    (Loud defeated sigh). Let’s begin by discussing what NOT to do when seeking reconciliation.
When Harry talks about leaking and planting stories - that is Markle talking about the Bully Report and the bullying.  Markle was desperate to make sure those stories were not in her narrative.  But the truth is the truth - she did bully a 3 year old girl, distressed her mother, bullied Catherine's staff and when Catherine approached her about it - Markle said it was a lie, a smear campaign.  Catherine and William knew the truth - they had seen Markle's bullying.  The Queen caught markle red-handed bullying a chef who was working in the palace and had to take her aside to tell her not to speak to the staff that way.  They all knew that she was a bully - and Harry was too.  So when those stories came out - they were TRUE.  And Harry wanted the palace to LIE and say they weren't true - basically traumatizing those who were bullied for a SECOND TIME.  He didn't care about the women who were victimized by his wife.  He wanted his cake and to eat it too.  Markle and Harry are evil.  And as a progressive Democrat - it gives me no pleasure to say Markle is just like Trump, except on the LEFT.
I used to love Prince Harry. He's now become a ginger winger. Honestly all he has done since becoming a married man is bloody moan.
I love the part where Harry says he's grateful for the British taxpayers funding his £42million wedding, even though they were married in secret 3 days beforehand.
Oh look they are wearing matching outfits. Maybe they will ride off into the sunset together
I'm sorry Harry but u cant say u want your brother back when u continue to talk against him and his job and his identity that he has the right to be happy with. Meghans got you under a spell and has exploited your trauma and feeds off it using it as a battering ram for her own issues. We even see her reaction and feelings in the Documentary when William is mentioned and it is loaded with agression and sarcasm. Therein lies the problem. Meghan wants full control over u and she can do that by causing u to fall out with your family. It happens every so slowly until yr no longer on speaking terms.  William is not the issue and neither is the monarchy, meghan is the sole cause! Wake up! Its time to regain honour for your family if u want them back and stop believing the lie that meghan is a victim. Its a tactic. Wake up.
You did wrong marrying Meghan, she just wants division all the time. You are so naive or maybe stupid not to realise that she lies in every interview
His ridiculous and rehearsed gesturing 😂
"Boo-hoo hoo. Me, Me, Me."
Hello haters, how are you? Have you still not been suffocated by your hatred? I wish you a lot of hate and negative energy in your pathetic life for 2023, so that you never find inner peace. Those who are hated will continue to shine and love will always overshadow hate in their lives.
The Ginger Judas
Delusional Meghan Markle messed this mans head up! Look in the mirror Harry! You leaked everything not your family! The psychopath your with is poison to you!
It’s always what he wants, what she wants and if they don’t get what they wanted or their demands was denied they started putting tantrums. They have gone too far and this is not the way to get the trust back from your family. He is mentally deranged and he needs to stay away from public eye and get some serious help.  Thousands of interviews attacking and spreading smear campaigns against the RF, his own family is becoming their habit . This behaviour is destructive and unacceptable.  King Charles should and must cut the cord completely. The Parliament must remove their Royal titles for putting the Monarchy in disrepute over and over again.
They left the RF to pursue freedom so that they can wash as many dirty linen as they want.  All families have challenges one way or another.  The RF is much more complicated.  If H&M truly wants reconciliation, they would not have chosen this path.  There is no intention to heal the wounds.
Enough  😢, please !
Really hope Anderson doesn't disappoint in this interview.
Harry and Meghan belong on Jerry Springer, not 60 minutes. What an embarrassment.
I love the part when Anderson Cooper gets the Oprah treatment after this interview airs.
Do you believe what he says? Why don’t you ask William what a good brother he is? Or grandson ? Only Americans can believe him. He didn’t get what his wife wanted, and now is his revenge.  Why don’t you interview all the people that worked for him and Meghan and ask them about the bullying they got from those two. Increíble! It is just like Oprah’s interview full of lies. You should interview Lady C or Tom Bower.
Anderson Cooper is Oprah’s twin. All softballs.  This isn’t journalism.  It’s patronizing and a waste of time.
Its a like out of the handbook for some psychologie-student. Chapter: "How heavily narcicists typically behave ":  ... spit dirt and hate to other persons and harm them but playingthe victim on all things that happens + then be nice again without any reason + THEN be surprised that the other person (the one you harmed directly before) are not willing to be instantly "friendly" again + THEN play the victim again... and another round an another round ....and so on and on and on.  It could not become more typical behaviour of  mega-narcicism. Which MEghan surely is but in my opinion also Harry is one. All soooo much staged for their own purpose and for the money they hope to earn with more book-selling. How can people NOT  see through their cheap strategies?
“It never needed to be this way”…Harry always spins the story as though he was “forced” to do these terrible things. He is an arrogant, spoilt, coddled rich boy. EVERYONE SUFFERS Harry! That is the human experience and the human condition! You are not owed anything, nor are you entitled to get what you want.   The more he talks, the more vile he becomes. Loathsome man-child.
Anderson Cooper has been lured into a dark trap…
Harry and Meghan are just giving Parliament more fuel to strip them of their ducal titles with their ongoing treachery against the Royal family. Whatevs. Then they'll whine about losing their Sussex titles. 🙄🙄🙄
It’s hard watching Harry betray his family for a talentless harlot who managed to get her claws into him by evoking his childhood trauma over his mother.
pls, H looks for a real job, no more complaints, grow up!!!!
1st Harry left  the Royal Family  because he was trapped  2nd the  media and 3rd they were too  popular 4th  and present time his brother bullied him
Why is 60 minutes giving the Harkles the time of day? The entitled narcissists that are Meghan and Harry need to go away. You have your 100 million. You don't care about the UK. Give up you titles, you ungrateful liars!
Why didn't he get Jerry Springer to do the interview.
Harry needs more money!
I wonder whats  thier nxt move after Releasing his Book when People  .Another  Book? Or a Series  like Kardishan's?
WHEN DOES IT END!?
They need reconciliation because money is running out....
Dr Phil is next on Harry and megs interview docket I’m calling it.
Harry, find something more productive to do with your life.
He should not trust CNN Cooper. They are all trying to manipulate his situation. These people don't care about you or your family, they only care about ratings.
Harry and Meghan, the best couple ever ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
No
I loved the part where Harry told Anderson that he knows that he betrayed his father King Charles  and his Brother the Prince of Wales for a 100 million Lie All Netflix Deal ! 😉
His interview can’t be revealing! Both himself and Megan are consistently vague about everything . They say nothing specific so a journalist can’t fact check it. Totally boring.
This should be the final nail in his royal coffin.  And so it goes.
No one cares about you Harry. Take your drama back to the UK.
Won't watch it !!!
I wonder if AC blows the interview ee.
No one cares.
I love the part where nothing Harry says is questioned, and MM sits proudly by listening with one tear brimming in her left eye - GO!
More whining Harry?!?! Time to tell everyone AGAIN how traumatized you are over your moms death 25 YEARS AGO?!?!?! Stop using Diana to make money!!! What a pig.
William inherited 1 billion dollars after Queen Elizabeth died.
Meghan and Harry should leave the royal family out of their mouth!   However, they won't because their income in the US depends on their royal connections!  Also, were Meghan and Harry not speaking with Thomas Markel because he once spoke to the press to reconcile with his daughter?! So why do Meghan and Harry think it's okay for them to speak to the press and shame the royal family and ask for reconciliation? Hypocrites 🤭
Poor Harry, just do what you do best:   Whinging  and walking 2 steps behind your wife holding the umbrella.
i can only hope the book won't sell - if you want to read it, get a library card...
Prince Harry is telling his truth. Both his mother and father had books published. Why not Harry and the Duchess of Sussex?
Anderson - I hope with every fiber of my being you have not made this a puff piece about Harry.  I'm looking forward to some good hard journalistic Anderson prowess with the tough questions and even tougher follow up questios.  Please don't ruin your reputation - don't let us down sir!
I like the part where the young Prince establishes a mental health foundation with his brother and sister-in-law, then later claims that he couldn't get mental health help for his wife in her time of crisis... surrounded by help....
Why is Batman doing the trailer voiceover?
Not watching.
Is this the part where Harry isn’t done with the leaking and planting of stories? 😂
We are tired of hearing you and your wife's side Harry. Please go to therapy with your family and shut up. People who want to reconcile do not do this. People who want to heal do not do this. And you're supposed to work for Betterup? You are a broken man and your wife has broken you further unfortunately.
OMG!!!!!  Just shut up Harry we are sick and tired of you.  You wanted a normal life out of the public eye.  The public don’t want to hear anymore of your entitlement, nonsense and whining.  If they watch it’s only because they are watching seeing you make a fool of yourself even more.  Do something useful and go home to princess Pinocchio and hand back your titles you are not a Duke or Duchess so stop making money off those titles.  Hand them back because why would you want to continue being associated with what you claim to be a racist institution, awful family that have bullied you, told your wife she couldn’t get help for suicidal feelings and wouldn’t protect you.
I love the part where it's going to be a bigger load of BS (if that's possible) than what has gone on so far. How many more times will he need to keep doing this???!!!!!!
Manipulating, privileged middle aged man, prepared to be disloyal to his family and country for dollars. Totally ashamed of him. Nothing like his brother William who is a credit to the nation.
I love the part where Meghan is just off camera telling Harry exactly what to say.
As someone who happens to be a commonwealth citizen and monarchist he's NOT my prince
With so many supposed Royal "Experts" profiting from their tell all biographies about the Royals i'm so pleased that Prince Harry has released his memoir. It's HIS story to tell and He has every right to do so!
Pathetic again, him talking of betrayal is just grand
Doria abandoned Meghan from 8 years old to 18 when she walked out after taking as much money as possible when Thomas won the lottery
More  lies and crying boohooo!! Grow up!! move on!!! 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄
it's 2023 and this is still going on. the world has bigger issues!
Is Anderson Cooper going to be silenced like other interviewers have been so that Just Harry and his wife can just flip the truth to suit themselves and throw their evidence-free accusations around?
Man, this comment section is BRUTAL. I think Prince Harry and Meghan should get some audience analysis done because I don't THINK those two are GETTING the MESSAGE from the American people.    I really liked Prince Harry. He was my kinda guy when he let loose in Vegas 😜🕺🏼😘  But I'm staying QUIET because I LIKE him. I REALLY WISH he'd get some audience analysis. He CLEARLY is NOT GETTING THE PUBLIC FEEDBACK🤦🏾‍♀️
There was me expecting nonsense crayon scribblings
I love Anderson Cooper, but he'll suffer a lot of backlash, like Oprah. He's being markled. I will NOT watch this false pity play. And all for money.
Continued lies why bother to watch
Harry just can't stand that his father and brother are remaining dignified by keeping silence. Harry knows nothing of dignity--he sold his dignity.
A Vanderbilt and Prince reveal the world as an unfair place to live.
Maybe it was Meghan leaking the stories????? This guy redefines stupid.
Love Harry & Meghan,  on a human level they are just so attractive, because they are naturally good and wise :) They have done a lot of courageous steps and charitable as well as creative projects in their live… So why even comment on it „critically“?!? Instead of giving them credit for this and plenty of gratitude on top!!!  …for being a obviously a very beautiful couple! They are that type of sensitive and strong everyone souls should take example from… Or at least keep calm. (As not even a single of their so called haters has ever achieved what they did and what they both are standing for ;)
I love how he is getting famouse doing exactly what they disowned meghans father for
Poor Harry hates being in the limelight.
Watch it in your spare time .
Meghan needs this book to do well , to bump up her massive divorce settlement ! Good job Aitch !
Harry and his rotten book are not welcome in CHILLINGBOURNE - no traitors allowed.
Again ? WTF just how many are u gonna tell us ?
He moved away to have 'a normal life' as he put it in his statement when they went to Canada. How whipping up a media storm by airing your dirty laundry and bitterness in public is going to convert into having a normal life, I don't know. I suggest moving to Africa as your heart has always been there Harry (genuinely), focusing on running your own business and on a select few chosen charity projects to back. This has to feel hollow and not fulfilling. You could do a lot of good in this world, as you used to, instead of peddling antagonistic hate against your family.
Who cares??!!!!!  It will be the same whiney crap, just regurgitated again.  😠🤢🤮🤧🥱🥱🤥🤥🤥🤥🤥
Why are they dress dressed like twins. I think Anderson has a crush. I've never thought that about anyone else Anderson interviewed but I'm feeling an attraction here. I hope he asks Harry the right questions and make Harry make sense. I'm not very optimistic about that. More bs
My god .what planet is this fella living on. I mean. I cant  .
I wonder which house they borrowed for this
Did they USE another house for this interview also?
Another "interview" to try and make them look good but ends up backfiring 🥲
Harry and Megan are doing this for Money! They have lied and bashed his family for millions! Everyone has problems but you forgive and try to make things better. If I was given a small cottage rent free I would be so grateful.
I think Harry is actually living a way much better life than he would have under the royals. Harry has always  played second fiddle to his older  brother just because his brother was first born.. I think Harry have opportunities and Harry has something to look forward to than just being a royal and limited to what he want to do in life . His wife broken those chains and set him free from all of that...... he's finally happy truly happy in life and I am happy for him.
Non-journalist Anderson Cooper fed him the answers. Puff piece.
Who cares!??
Won't watch, Cooper is not a good interviewer and traitor Harry needs to go away
Harry is so lovely ❤️
You lost a fan and a viewer Anderson Cooper...  Forever.  Oh... And respect too as an 'interview' with pre approved questions is not an interview but a skit.
Harry i wish u all happiness and peace. Harry is the victim in issue between the royal family & Meghan. Harry you stay calm, engage yourself in some education course or prepare yourself for some achievements apart form the humanitarian activities you do, these will put you in a positive space in a year very magically. Read online blogs about overcoming trauma. dont be dependent on anyone for your mental health, you mental health should come from within you and not from outside. keep a goal u wanna achieve in next one year and work hard for it.
Excuse me ? When 60  minutes become a tabloid? Oh when they agreed to interview serial liars and hypocrites who have zero  gratitude for the opportunities they’ve had. I won’t be watch the whinging or 60 minutes ever again. Talk about away to destroying credibility assuming it was there in the first place.
Cuz he would never sell out his family...oh wait
I love the part when it dawns on Anderson that he's been markled.
More lies from a bitter,spiteful, narcissistic, jealous manchild throwing a tantrum because he's got an older brother who is going to be King. Definately an hour not to watch.
This guy just doesn’t know when to shut up
Here we go again - poor me, poor hard done by [$100 millionaire?] me….
*Prince Harry tells @andersoncooper he's just a below-average human being:  "Nothing extraordinary in fact, just your worst kind of sponger."*
I've no doubt that Charles is already familiar with the entire book. Between MI5, MI6, CIA, MOSS_AD, etc. . . and just plain old bribery, the Harkles aren't blindsiding them THIS time. What fool$ these two are!
I love the part where Henry avoids the media at all cost to protect his family's privacy.
Harry is worse than I thought. What's he going to do when he discovers that the *"leaks"* are *"ALL MEGHAN MARKLE???"*
It's like a poorly written soap opera!
I sincerely hope the comments are turned off when the complete version of this hits Utube.
UT oh . SMH  🙄
All baseless allegations, where’s the evidence ?
He’s going to lose his title!! I can feel it
Another libtard mouthpiece!!!
Sad for their kids. They belong  with the royal family life in Britain , not hidden away in Santa Barbara. It’s their heritage. Put the selfishness aside and think of the kids.
The PR of the Royal family fooled us.  Harry seemed witty, kind, and charismatic. Once magic faded, we see a narrow-minded, resentful, highly dependent, and sick person with obsessive-compulsive disorder. He needs help not publicity.
Well he has a book to sell.  Won’t watch it
Can I watch this in Britain? I want to watch it
Enough already with these self-absorbed narcissists. With so many people suffering right now they could be working to give real help to people instead of continuing to wallow in their own pity pool filled with $$$. It's beyond pathetic how completely tone-deaf they are!
Disgusting 60 Minutes disgusting
Spare the mini series Netflix?
Why don't you interview Jason Knauf?
Does Harry really expect his father and brother to reconcile with him after trashing them. And then claiming they’re making him the villain when he and his wife did that for money?! He is terrible.
As far as I’m concerned, Anderson Cooper just threw seven decades of journalistic integrity under the bus!  @andersoncooper @cbs @cnn Cooper should be fired if he didn’t challenge Harry on anything!
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
🤮
If his book is as “explosive” as the Netflix mockuseries, I’ll expect anti-climatic crickets then. Media really has to stop baiting us with these buzzwords “explosive” and “bombshell”, there’s nothing remotely close to either of those words with anything the Harkles have said so far. Just a whiny twosome milking every penny they can get out of trashing the royal family. I personally believe Megan is a diagnosable narcissist but she’s doing everything she can to benefit herself and it’s working. Harry on the other hand is a literal tool: born on a silver platter, one of the most privileged people on the planet, and has been taken a fool by this gold-digging social climbing older divorcee of a woman. He is in for a rude awakening one day. It will happen when he wakes up and it dawns on him wtf he has done to his life.
Ohhh noo not this guy, I really admire the selection and range of your topics...but this is just shame to pay any attention to these narcissistic couple
Racist Britain - this is one of our FAVOURITE broadcasters   https://youtube.com/shorts/7jNR2QcoPKk?feature=share
Dear Mr Cooper, I see you’re doing another ‘Oprah Winfrey‘ interview. I hope you have done your homework. Have you read Tom Bowers book Revenge?  I suspect not. Have you contacted Princess Diana’s Butler or any other official Royal correspondent for an insiders opinion? Again I suspect not. Prince Harry is another lightweight like his mother who ensured her charity works were well photographed and publicised by ‘her crew’ of photographers which she  alternately castigated or employed  at whim to ensure maximum sympathy. Princess Anne whose good work dwarfs hers quietly gets on with it behind the scenes and although she deserves it, she will never get the attention given to Harry. That you are indulging in this pity fest with a disgraceful relation of our historic Monarchy I hope you will come to regret. I recommend you watch a few broadcasts of Megyn Kelly before this interview. She at least is honest.
Prince Harry, the public are not your psychologists.
I love the part where mainstream media is only out to ask softball questions and forgets they're supposed to be unbiased and objective. One tear left eye go!
Harry destroy himself not Queen Elizabeth legacy. His nonstop whining shows how immature and narcissist he is
miss cooper=SCUM/punk harry and golddigger$$$$$markle/scummy netflix/scummy oprah/scummy CBS$$$$$
Pathetic on a cellular level
Sorry, folks, but it's not an interview!  It's a carefully scripted spin that Harry has had to memorize---something he can answer.  That's not journalism, Anderson Cooper, that's a 2nd grade prompt & response.  It would be interesting and revealing to see what would happen if the interviewer dumped the pre-established script and went for some hard-hitting questions----questions that would not be expected.
GO  AWAY HAZBEEN    YAWN,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They want the titles and the british to pay them without any of the public royal duties or service to the British people.  She wants the clothes and celebrity friends and left wing politics.  The most ungrateful greedy people on the planet.
I love the part where Harry makes vague accusations but never backs anything up. I REALLY love the part where Harry acts like only he was hurt by his mother's  untimely death. I also love the part where Harry and Harry's Wife moan about their life while living in one of the richest communities in the States. I love how Harry threw Granny under the bus by pretending she was some vulnerable old lady in the hands of the "men in grey." I love how Haz called his father a liar without saying what the lies were. I love how Harry and Harry's Wife are THE most persecuted people on the planet.
H and M do not want to reconcile with the royal family. They are social climbers who want to start a public discourse with the a listers in the Royal Family that they can turn into more books and reality shows. They are also hoping Queen b will text again so they can mention that. Would Harry mention it if he had a fight with Peter Phillips? No because Peter is not an a list member of the royal family. Speaking of Peter, why isn't Harry complaining that it isn't fair that Peter is so far down the line of succession. If his mom Ann had been male Peter would be up before Eugene and Beatrice. His plight is worse that Harry's according to Harry's logic. If Harry deserves a shot at being King what about Peter? And if Harry becomes King what about Lily? What should Archie be king and Lily not Queen?
Forgive of course, but not forget!#
I wish this pair would disappear for good. North Korea would take them.
I’m waiting for Harry to appear on Dr Phil. Then I might watch it.
I hope Anderson would ask what happens in Liverpool 14 of January 2019 with the bump
I love the part when 72 engagements become 6 years
There is always your side,  their side and the truth. I have the feeling there is something more.
As a proud Brit and former member of HM Armed Forces, I am disgusted with this man. He is a disgrace to his regiment 🇬🇧
Try shutting up Harry. That's one step towards reconcilliation
https://youtube.com/shorts/G9hYfHFBbIA?feature=share
Prince harry should Also have zoom meetings with Zambia,  Egypt, Iraq,  Turkey,  Israel , and Holocaust survivor's
I won’t be watching this feast of self pity and lies. Not watching 1 minute
Little bratt.
Prince harry should also go to places like standing rock like Bernie sanders dis.
Repeat repeat repeat…. Moan moan.. He sounds quite spoilt really. Talks about mental health… but is doing this to his brother in public.. nice uh
Prince harry should know Panama is in Egypt
the audacity of him to put the burden of reconciliation on them when he is the reason there needs to be any reconciliation in the first place. you don't punch somebody in the face then demand that they apologise to you for hurting your fist. his victim complex is sickening
Mexico caught Chinese spies .
Prince harry needs to acknowledge china presence in United kingdom investigating Without a permit or warrant
Prince harry needs to speak with Taliban leaders , Afghanistan about china presence and China houng to war with India
Meghan’s mouth piece and puppet is here
Prince harry atleast you didn't get attacked by asians and all then fed rat turds at Egyptian 415 restaurant and tea 4 u san Francisco,  California
I would not trust H&M to pet sit for me. they will tell everything even if being their for 5min. Does this sound like a couple seeking privacy ? I don’t think so lol ✋🏽
Prince harry needs to create relationships with Poland go get them to stop sending missles for Russia to Ukraine
"We protect the ecology, that's why we are flying by private jets.  We want a privacy, that's why we are shaking our underwear 24/7.  We are simply Harry and Meghan, that's why call us Duke and Duchess of Sussex and we demand a royal privileges.  We want to have a family, that's why we are trashing our relatives. We want to tell a truth, that's why we are lying nonstop".
Prince harry speak with paparazzi will help refugees and asylum seekers.
The sheer amount of differing opinions in this thread with the vast majority here being utterly disgusted with Markle and Harry prove these are not bots - but decent people who can no longer stand for the vicious bullying by Harry and Markle of William, Catherine and King Charles III who have not said one negative word about them the entire time.  We are just sick and tired of Harry and Markle - and it's growing into an intense dislike of epic proportions.  And I'm a progressive democrat - not a cult member republican. (But the sugars sure are very much like the Trump cult members that were running around during his presidency. Lie and attack and double down on the lies and then believe the lies).  Trump and Markle - both cheap reality show stars, both materialistic, both substandard at their jobs, both attack enemies of what they are guilty of, both bully others if they don't worship them.
This prince needs a real job.
What we need is a strong, courageous interviewer who would be allowed to challenge this interviewee. He needs tackling, head-on about the lies, inconsistencies and spiteful jibes. But both interviewer and interviewee will be heavily scripted and pre-approved by interviewer's wife and interviewer's employer. IMHO. Waste of time. Its a repeat of a repeat of a repeat......ad nausea. Or 'another chance to enjoy..'.
Gordon Ramsey came her, samuel l Jack , aftershock Prince harry should also attend many events.
Prince harry needs to get relationships in the middle east for peace in countries like Qatar, Kuwait,king Solomon and crown prince.
In this book, Harry is going to attack his brother for yelling at him.  That's because Markle was bullying women in the palace and William went there with their affidavits and now Harry is calling it a smear campaign.  He is calling the victims lying racists who are after Markel - he is RE-TRAUMATIZING them TWICE with his and Markle's lies.  In this book he's going to attack the closest thing to his mother's good side that walks the planet - Catherine, Princess of Wales, knowing full-well that she will not defend herself.  Now WHO IS THE BULLY?  WHO ARE THE BULLIES?  William, Catherine, and King Charles III have not said one negative word about Markle and Harry - though God knows I would've.  But William even told the press to lay off of Markle while they were dating.  King Charles sent his love in his first speech as King.  Tell me - WHO ARE THE BULLIES?  I wish the real journalists would ask the tough questions of Harry and Markle - like why are they bullies?  And why is Archewell registered in Delaware?  And how much have they given personally to charity (not how much they have lent their names to a charity but given nothing but a few photo ops and get their friends to donate some purses they made).  Did Anderson Cooper ask about why they chose to smear Jason Knauf who worked for them as well as William and Catherine and has done absolutely NOTHING wrong.  In fact, he was the whistle blower on Markle's bullying.  Are they attacking the victims of their bullying TWICE?  Calling them racist liars?  I hope Anderson Cooper employed his journalistic integrity for that. I am a progressive Democrat who has no pleasure in saying these two people, Harry and Markle, even though we may share some political beliefs - these two people are evil.  Yes, I've said it.  And I meant it.  They're lying, greedy, jealous, narcissistic BULLIES.
Prince harry should also call Romania about Andrew tate Islamophobia rape situation
Prince harry should go to FIFA would cup in Morocco 2023
Prince harry should Engage with Ukraine leader zelensky and Putin of Russia
It's just confirming that someone looking after this 2 bad people.  They're making sure to put down the monarchy!
Prince harry needs too engage relationships with California Govenor gavin Newsom,  paul Pelosi, Brian Dahle,  Doris Matsui and Darrell steighnburgh hilary Clinton,Meghan McCain's,  Joe biden
Prince harry will get power when he introduces himself to events and agencies but dedicating time takes time.
Prince harry should Also volunteer his time for the homeless in southern California and Habitat for Humanity.
He's an utter disgrace, a weak, pathetic man, a liar on a grand scale
So sick of Harry and his wife. Stop giving these two multi millionaire whiners a platform to complain. 🙄🤮
Prince harry should Also volunteer at hospitals like Sunak and follow his leadership and try to incorporate ot with stability and guidance.
60 seconds is 59 seconds to long, Harry.
Does this guy ever stop whining
Prince harry needs to reevaluate himself,  fame, Hollywood and his duties as a Monarch too see if hes ready to do his duties or give up his titles for a lifestyle that comes and goes.
Nobody in the US gives a s*** about spoiled whiney prince and his grifting wife  I predict low ratings
Prince harry needs to speak with Sunak and the concern for parliament and Europe for Europe
I love this couple this is true love, thank you God for them we wouldn't have known the truth, without them. ❤️
Prince harry should have talks with Shanghai and hong Kong,  China
Prince harry should speak with frances Macron
Next Sunday? Is that the first coming Sunday or Sunday next week?
Prince harry should attend events like g7 summits for America and ambassador it.
I love the part where Harry is confronted with his many outright lies & inconsistencies.
Prince harry needs to investigate Panama papers , Panama,hulu movie and Netflix

Christian Ronaldo Z got signed with soccer team Saudi Arabia
Prince harry should speak with the sultan and king of arab and Islamic  nation , Oman
the north korean dictator is more responsible than him and the north korean dictator probably survived on a smaller budget
Prince harry should become friends with Christian Ronaldo
I won’t be watching or reading any stuff about the book.
Why would 60 minutes agree to this PR manipulation? Predict Cooper will not challenge his scenario. At minimum he would get called a racist if he does. Anyway lots of people do stories on this drama because the public seems interested. Any press is good press but not journalism at all in the case of the Sussexes.
How many times, is the last time, we hear the same thing from Harry, over and over? Please Anderson, put an end to this whining and ask the questions, you know should be asked. If you don't, I believe, you will have damaged your own career. "They shoot horses don't they?"
More lies…
I love the part when Anderson asks Prince Harry what did you mean when you said? ....."It’s amazing what people will do when offered a huge amount of money."
He and his wife are so sickening.
👎
Did he not learned "never to wash dirty laundry in public"!??? The world must forget the names "Prince Harry and Megan Marbles"!
H has nothing new to say bye
I love the part where he says Nottingham Cottage is too small for them, totally tone-deaf to many people that don't have any roofs over their heads during these hard times. Really brings a tear to my left eye on their hard life living in a mansion.
Poor victim Harry the Petulant. His family painting him as a villain by not listening to his years of whinging, so sad (one tear, left eye). Of course his only recourse is to go on TV and point out how mean his family is for not allowing him and his wife to do whatever they want plus pay him millions for the privilege. 🙄
Quit royalty. Wanted a life in US without media harassment. But, appeared in media giving interviews all the time!!
I like the part where Harry accuses them of making him out to be the bad guy when it’s LITERALLY all he has done since he left.
I hope Anderson questions that charles leaked story after summit in December because it was already leaked in people magazine in October by article set up by meghans friend Abigail Spencer
Harry and Meghan are hot cake. 2023 and forever will be a wonderful year for them. Prayers up 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
I won't be watching.
Well i guess this will let us know who the real Bully is......... W
I love the part where William becomes king and Harry rattles on the Palace gates asking, 'any 'spare' change mate'? All this while skidmarks watches from her vast mansion with hubby no8 ... brings a tear to my left eye....
My god 60 Minutes!!!  Seriously...you now do hit pieces????    Just one sided/unsourced /scripted stories now?????
Oh I remember the part where the black beautiful woman whip their prince and took him away on the freedom flight to America and now all the Brits are having a fit their Prince is no longer going back to their  racist trashy Britain got over it.
Prince Harry to appear on Britain’s Got Dullards
I’m sure all your complaining is going to make your family want to take back you two overgrown babies. Maybe Meghan can teach people the proper way to disrespectfully curtsy… she can charge for it.. as she always needs to get paid for her efforts!
not interested , and dirt digger Anderson . from fake network news Cnn .  also not interested .
Hey Harry.. King Charles,  Prince William and Princess Kate are working at a very large scale on issues that go beyond whining and complaining bout decisions you made. Let Go and stop using your family and the Royal family to make money. 2023 should be  The year you move on with your philanthropy and let go of your past. Both you and your wife need to move on because you have pivoted and are wealthier and happier per your Netflix documentary -you are thriving in normal lives. If this is true- move on! Americans will soon be over you guys. Don't get me wrong-they will be nosy and you will make money bashing your family but if whining as oppose to healing is you and your wife's sole goal-that is the sadness of your story. This branding tactic will wear old quickly. Resilency is 5he re brand.
The family should pay her the ransom it will probably take to extricate H. Then the epic divorce,and custody battle can start. He has a lot of making up to do to the people that have financed his life, the citizens of the UK.
ratio, as on all Markle / Harry youtube vids, is brutal in dislikes
Markle and Harry are narcissist psychopaths and the royal family must be protected from them. they are vicious bullies and narcissists in fury that the Queen, and now Charles doesn't kiss their feet. Markle truly is a deranged woman, and this pair of repulsive people make William and Catherine look like such a good people. God save the King!
Who cares? I have better things to do than follow this drama.
Here is a tip....There is nothing new to see here.
How much is he getting paid for this “trash fest”?
Oh Anderson, I pray you’re not playing with fire.  M & H are not to be trusted ever.
So tired of these two grifting liars!!!!
Harry is just pathetic.  Boycott this mess. There is nothing new to see here.
Trash prince
At this point, I think Meghan should leave him.  Hear me out. She thought she bagged a Prince and her own personal fairytail, but turns out she MARRIED DOWN. At least emotionally, intelectually and spiritually. Her life was better before she ever met this dude. Meghan, I think you deserve better than this!
This is so horrible. Harry is selling his so called "story" for a lot of $$$ knowing well RF will not respond. What a betrayal. He was fine with his brother, father...etc until that woman came and look at the damage now.
They have more than the royal family to reconcile with, they have the whole of Britain and the commonwealth countries too.
SHAME ON YOU HARRY!!! TURNING ON YOUR OWN FAMILY OVER A DIVORCED GIRL? WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO IF SHE DIVORCES YOU? WHERE WILL YOU GO?
Harry wants the $$$$ from the RF but not the efforts he himself would be expected to make. See ya! So long! Goodbye Harry!!!
I love the part where Prince Harry explains how being a titled multi-millionaire is worse than being a lower middle class blue collar worker and we should feel sorry for him.
I mean, Prince Harry is comparing leeks to Buckingham Palace press office says releasing press, statements. This guy is legitimately crazy. It’s the role of Buckingham Palace staff to release press statements, but he’s saying they are leeks. Prince Harry, talk about miss information. This guy is writing the book on it. He is horrific his wife is horrific, they should be banned from the UK, their titles should be stripped. I am so sick of their self indulgent, narcissistic, bratty behavior. Saying that Buckingham Palace, releasing press statements is leaking stories is just beyond the pale. And anybody who believes this load of crap deserves to go to the mental institution.
What narcissistic exhibitionists the Harkles are, and it is seemingly unending.
Can't wait to hear about Harry's life in his own words
Another 30 silver coins for meghan and harry
The spare , traitor Harry the puppet . Shameful men he’s .
Another interview??????
If Meghan had died in the Uk. Many would have said how bad a husband Harry is.  Until you are in someone shoes never think you know how it feels to be in that position. If you grow up in place where power n authority rules you. You gradually become breathless n power controls you. I know exactly what Harry is going through.
I love the part when he handed his balls to the wife to keep in a jar.
Will they ever stop making money by trashing the Royal Family?
Harry, you chose this path. Do something that will earn you wealth without bashing your family. Get a job, get a life.
enough already... US has it own problems... 60 minutes really Oprah was enough Here let me plant a story WE DON'T CARE
Harry is even further lost than I thought. He can’t see the truth, his mind is really warped. This will not end well for him.
Was ist das Ziel/Plan dieser Aktionen.  Will sie Königin werden und er ihr Prinzgemahl?  Ja, dann müssen die anderen den Hofknicks lernen….
I find it really strange that people are so quick to call Harry and Meghan liars yet they have ZERO reason to lie.  The royal family, however, have a lot of motivation to lie.  They're trying to protect their power, wealth, and way of life.  Harry just genuinely wants to protect his wife and family.
This is so far beneath Anderson C. and 60 Minutes.  Quite disappointed by CBS and will be boycotting.
Menschen Hungern, frieren, sind krank  und haben Jobprobleme. Ach und es wüten auch noch Kriege.  Außerdem gibt es zwei Menschen  auf diesem wunderbaren Globus, die leben in Fülle im Paradies und schmeißen mit Dreck um sich.  Was stimmt hier nicht????  Die  Dame glättet ihre Haare - warum? Schämt sie sich wegen irgendwas? Warum steht sie nicht zu Ihren Ahnen? Was ist ihr Problem. Der Herr hat nichts gelernt, daher verkauft er Dreck und macht aus diesem Schmutz ungeniert ein Vermögen.  Ihr beiden Menschenfreunde, schenkt doch all dieses … Geld an die wirklich Bedürftigen auf der Welt. Verkauft Eueren Luxus und helft damit die Not z.b. in Afrika zu lindern….
What more does Harry have to cry about just shut up Harry and your liar wife.
Royal family will and should stay in dignity silence. Harry you never introduced yourself to Thomas Markle, and now AGAIN you are talking publicly about your family, what we actually don’t wanna hear or know about. And you are wondering that they are distancing themselves? Wow!
Get out of our beautiful America, Harry! We have serious issues here, homelessness, opioids epidemic, poverty, crime... And you come to snitch your family because you are evil? Get out of our country sc*mbug!! We need people who built out nation to a better environment, with moral values,and with the lack of love we are facing, and you are bringing all the opposite!!! Go AWAY!
Dear Lord, let there be healing and forgiveness in the British Royal Family!
All you need to know can be found in 2x books! 1- TOM BOWER - REVENGE! Tom is a legal barrister and a royal reporter... Talk about truth bombs 💥  2- the courtiers by Balentine  Anything else is horse sh$& Anderson Cooper did another Oprah
Do something productive and helpful for  mankind Don't make money by selling royal gossip, H and M  It's disgusting and stnky  I'm sick of their victimhood
There’s still “explosive content” a whole Oprah interview and Netflix documentary later ?😂😂Man, these two are masters at branding
Not interested!
Excuse me for paraphrasing the bible...but. When the rich lead the rich, it can causeth them both to fall into a ditch.
Cooper, you just might have to kiss your job good bye!!! You feel right into the 2 snakes trap!!!!!!
Harry will still regret what he's doing.  There are conflicts in many families, but relationships need to be worked on.  There are probably few brothers who have not quarreled with each other.  The royal family would also probably have a lot to say about him and about his wife, who plays the oppressed innocent.  And yet they are tactfully silent, though they themselves are spat upon.  But this is a class that Harry clearly lacks.  Recently, while looking at Megan's post-wedding look, I found that someone who would be so rejected and oppressed at the royal court would not look so radiant in every photo.  First, the reason for the trip was given by the paparazzi, and now they are trying to do business on the royal family without scruple.
Can someone stop the bad propaganda and the smear campaign against the Royal family in America?  Promoting family disrespect through this platform for the younger generations to learns that they can dutch their parents and siblings  when they are not given what they want is just disgusting!
I for one definitely will not be watching it. I am very tired of the Whiners. I thought 60 minutes was a competent show. I see it has gone down hill.
It would better if Harry had only spent exactly 60 minutes airing his complaints worldwide cause this would be all over with long ago.
There have been ‘spares’ throughout the centuries of all monarchies. Its a traditional part of every global monarchy wherever it may be. Always has been and always will be. One disgruntled offspring like Harry does not have authority to change tradition.  Harry should give consideration to his late great Aunt Margaret (the Queens sister) who was not jealous or resentful but in fact totally accepted, appreciated and enjoyed her ‘spare’ position within the family.  Harry, in memory of your great Aunt Margaret you should shamefully humble yourself.
Haz to CBS wardrobe department,  "My wife wants me to wear whatever Anderson Cooper wears in a complimentary color."
I love the part when harry makes his family small to feel bigger!
#TeamHazAndMeg
The Hasbeen Cable Actor & husband took two minutes of content and have turned it into a Lifetime Achievement of whining and complaining.
Just lost all respect for Anderson Cooper.Seems he can be bought too.Lets see if he asks any real questions or if he cops out like Oprah
If people would listen they would hear exactly why he is speaking out. He is being very courageous.
Trust him at your peril ,he will undoubtedly stab you in the back ,money,money, money.
More tripe from Harry on the way then . This moaning twerp should just keep quiet , go away and have the so called " private life " he claimed he and his wife wanted .  And as for calling Harry Markle " the author " is laughable.
Let me guess, ‘William shouted at me more than once and I was left petrified. Meghan had to find the  mandrakes in the gardens of our ‘housing unit’ in the palace grounds entirely by herself. She then woke me up to my agony that the firm has perpetuated since my birth.’ 🙄  Looking forward to some hard hitting questions…such as asking them to elaborate with specifics.
I am amazed that Anderson would put his reputation on the line interviewing this grifter.
I love Harry and Meghan I really do. But I really want them to just stop. Even if it's all true it's too much and I think HE will regret it 1 day.
“SPARE” Me! Will he ever just stop whining?!? A middle aged, entitled man who is a victim?!? 😂😂😂😂😂 Please stop giving the Sussexes a platform so they can disappear into that much desired “privacy” and “freedom.” Hypocrites!  Anderson Cooper is SOFT. 🤣
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I hope he gets the mental health help he needs. Then please leave the US we have enough of these types of people and have met our quota.
This year I’m not playing into these privileged games with Harry , Meghan and the royals , I am honestly sick of the whining , it’s draining to hear the same sht over and over again then the “ I want my family back “‘speel …. phone your fkn dad and brother and stop the attention seeking pity party Ffs
Anderson Cooper could have offered Hawwy a tissue everytime he sniffed!
I can’t believe you gave  a platform to this traitor, disgrace hypocrites, liar wannabe prince 🤮😡
Just stop Harry don't you have enough money. I know you and meghan think you're perfect but to continually blame and trash your family for everything is not a good look. You use to be my favorite royal but since you've been with meghan not so much. Didn't watch your show and won't read your book because you and meghan have lied so much I wouldn't believe any thing you write
Those of us that witnessed how his mother Dianna was pursued, hounded and continually reported on negatively whilst the family and the press knew of her severe depression and eating disorders etc we haven't forgotten how miserable they made her so personally my opinion Harry taking his family away from that situation that could have quite easily repeated itself was the best decision he ever made I think his mother if she was still with us would fully support him and be very proud of him. I wish Harry, Meghan and their beautiful children all the best
What next Harry?  A broadway play called: Spare?  Pathetic.
Same old whinging ex prince get a life
Are we supposed to be still listening to this crap in 2023?
This is what “Morally Bankrupt” looks like.  Selling your Mothers memory, your entire family & spitting on the grave of your grandparents.  Disgusting vile individual.
Gayle King is at CBS.  I will not watch anything connected with her after the Oprah interview & Gayle’s relayed information (gossip from Mattress & Sparey) …SICKENING!
This guy is a creep.
I thought they wanted privacy…. Enough with the press and using his family as a storyline😢
Harry is the modern day version of the biblical Cain and Judas rolled into one.
Disgraceful to make your business out of making your family and life issues public entertainment
Oh great strait  into the new year hearing his crap again and again and again Anyone noticed the the h and m fans commenting on people's posts...lol. so boring, same replys to everyone.. no we are not jealous  we are bored to death of them.
Who cares… over them already. Stay home with your 100 mill. And leave be
Shut up already
Sorry Harry, i must have Lost the part where you were forced to keep being a Prince and a duke of Sussex by the "institution"! It's ok to say "i wanted a family, not an institution!". Thus BE a Man, act and Stand by your own words and give back the "Prince "and the "Dukedom" to the Institution. Don't BE an hypocrite going, again&again,  to a TV programme regurgitating the same victime story. Enough, Harry! Own you words!  You know the other part can't come to TV to correct your speech, which is quite low move on your part to keep doing this kind of interview. It makes people like me, who is not British nor from the Commonwealth, come foward to use my voice to defend the other part  and Pull your hears! Own your words and give back the titles to the Institution. You Will Always BE a family member, a loved One as your grandmother Said. Just do it and finish this Saga for good. For you and for Archie, the One who needs his father to BE a Man to BE able to BE part of a family!
I love the part where he bashes the whole family and his second hand wife abuses the UK titles and still calling them racists, wants to reconcile under the DISGUISE OF BEING FAMILY. IT TOTALLY HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE TITLES FOR THEM OR THE KIDS, NEITHER MISUSING THE CONNECTIONS FOR A QUICK BUCK.
he’s done. no credibility or whatsoever. how can he expect his own father and brother to reconcile with him, if all of his complains that should be dealt privately as a family is now on the front pages of newspapers, books, phones etc. this guy is a mess just because of his willingness to put his agenda first than finding a common ground on how to handle things. no matter how he complains more people now think that he and meghan are a laughingstock
His only talent seems to be trashing his family for money. If you  have such a sibling, you don't need other enemies to live!
And of course he always picks people who aren't capable of asking hard hitting questions. I'd love to see him do an interview with on of the fox's folks or even australian cnn - people who are as sick of him as everyone else
At this point Harry and Meghan are to his father, brother and sister in law what they claim Meghan's father was to them.
They're working hard to become the most disliked couple ever, if they're not already. No matter where or to whom, if you just casually mention their names in small talk, there's a groan: Lord, spare us! 😂 I suppose their new professions are personae non gratae!  (I just shed a tear from my left eye.)
What else he is going to revel 😂😂😂
No one cares Harry more attacking his family and whining constant non stop and him expecting hundreds of millions for it
The end of the British monarchy is upon us.
Clown prince interviewed by clown "journalist" on clown MSM network. Good thing the trailer had the clownish voice over in the typical, American hyper dramatic way, it makes the clown show complete. 🤡🤣🤣🤣
I'll stick with 60 Minutes Australia, they still cover topics that matter.
What is there else to tell...is Anderson Cooper going the way of Oprah
Circus and two clowns 🤡 true story of Harry and his wife
Harry upset that his family wouldn’t lie for him and his wife.
Harry wants his father and brother back but spends every minute trashing them......Charles should just cut the guy 'off' everything..from titles to our tax money.
Harry will regret later, the time will come and Prince GEORGE will destroy Megan's children morally, he will make them nobody, he will not forget anything, he will always remember the attacks of Uncle Harry and his wife on Will's father and Catherine's mother, I do not envy the Montecito children in the future, and so it will be. Harry opened Pandora's box, inciting hatred in the family, an unenviable future will overtake him, he will pay in the future for everything.
Everyone has problems, why do they act like they are the ones that suffer, that don't feel safe going out. His mom died,very sad but lots of people have lost family and keep going on.
I skipped the Netflix series but with a real journalist, I will watch this and see whether he gets push-back on his and Meg's own transgressions, all the questions that William wanted to ask but couldn't.  Oprah was awful as an interviewer.  Let's hear him deny that Meg bullied staff to the point where they had an unprecedented degree of resignations or complained about performing senior royal assignments without getting paid even though they were being paid millions to do them, and so forth.
At this point I think it's plain and clear that he's having serious mental health problems and I say this as someone who has experienced this myself
REMOVE THEIR TITLES. And as far as commonwealth is concerned their kids are just randoms, no different to a kid at Walmart or some rando at McDonalds eating a burger. The kids aren’t anything to commonwealth so don’t deserve titles. Harry and the woman don’t deserve titles at all.
‘Waaaaaah wahhhhhh waaaaah I’m rich and privileged and spoilt waaaaaaaahh waaaaaaaah. My wife is a narcissistic bully who lies about racism even though she was still a white Woman when the bully accusations began. Waaaaaaaaai I’ve never missed a meal. I’ve never gone without shoes or medicine but I’ll cry oppression’
Has Harry escaped "The Claw"? The fact that he has been let out on his own should be the focus of this interview. x
😂😂😂 sounds and looks like an SNL SKIT!
Harry is such a loser
Just really uneducated people can support this circus 🤡
Where is all the EVIDENCE Harry? Stop whining until you have the proof to support to continuous disrespect of our Royal Family.
Well done Harry
I am so done. Hope King Charles does not let them go to Coronation they will get booed to fk
Is he going to spend the rest of his life whining? He left the royal family so move on. Find something else to concentrate on. This is getting really old.
Harry is such a muppet 🤣
Harry your family will always take you back but you must breakaway from the narcissist first.
Harry seems an expert in sending negative energies and bringing all dirty laundries and miseries into this world!  A puppet of Meghan, the drama queen!
Good for him
Why?
looks like a snore fest.
You can always tell the Brit RF troll brigade on here. They always start with I love the part. Another favorite tactic they use for Meghan is tear in the left eye. They think their being sarcastic but I believe they need professional help. Boy, the UK has really went downhill.
Really starting to sound like a broken record… I guess this is all he ever thinks about in California, revenge on his family .. whom he never thought was bad until Meghan told him so. Literally words from his own mouth. I wouldn’t trust whatever Meghan says because obviously she has a warped sense of self judging from her OWN words from her podcast, not any tabloids as she desperately wants us to believe.   Let’s face it, they are both so unlikable now. Shame, really. He may be the first prince that turned into a frog.
“ 60 minutes” ?? Think “ 60 seconds” is more than enough for Harry.
I'm thinking about starting a podcast interviewing people that haven't interviewed Harry. If I can find anyone.
What’s very clear to me is Harry is right about the Institution. I’ve watched covered of Harry and Meghan from the very beginning and there’s no doubt there was and is a concerted effort to put them in a corner and make them the villains and to plant glowing reviews and stories about William and Kate. It really is quite ridiculous now. William is no angel. Alleged reports he had an affair while Kate was pregnant. Strange how the usually rabid UK trash tabloids wouldn’t touch the story. Possibly because the tabloids ARE working in conjunction with the Palace?
Why?  Aren’t people sick enough of his constant whining and lies yet?
Seriously.....Harry continues to make a fool of himself.  Surely he has enough money now to keep Meghan
No thanks. I would find a visit to my granddaughter’s kindergarten class more intellectually stimulating.
Make no mistake ......truth or not apart......but this show & tell saga will go on forever as long as Harry The Royal Puppet and Meghan need this ongoing income stream......
Oh that's where that voice over movie guy from the 80's went to. He's now doing these voice overs. Interesting. My comment is much more interesting that Harry's interview, admit it.😂
Shame on Anderson Cooper if he went easy on him like when O gave Nutmeg a platform to lie and spew nothing but negativity and hate.
Wow! An interview that only shows Harry!!!!  I think Meghan decided to keep her greedy beak out of this one.
Is there a pool as to how many time he will mention “my mother”?
I want my father and brother back... right  after I make millions selling my autobiography next week lol.
This guy and his wife clearly suffer from mental health issues that makes them fantasists, if you will.  It is disappointing that 60 minutes is affording Harry the opportunity to spread disinformation, really.  It would be different if the questions were not known in advance and vague accusations were allowed to be challenged thoroughly.  But it has been well reported that he was not willing to agree to that kind of interview.  Again, disappointing, for what has always been a fairly reputable journalistic show.
Attack your family, decline Xmas invitations and then say they are not the ones willing to reconcile...  Right way to go Einstein!
New year. Same stupid Harry. Three years attacking his family yet he says they are the ones who don't want to reconcile. His entitlement and lack of self-awareness is off the scale.
Every interview is bombshell ... nothing interesting ..
Oh not again
Why? 2023 how about less about what they care or think about
What he’s doing is disgusting, how do you think is he just brainwashed or simply stupid?
I love the part Anderson looks un interested on harry.
Dear Prince harry,    Go away and stay away! And, dearest 60 minutes, my favorite show, please don't lower yourself to the tabloid shelf!
Love the part where Harry said that Oprah interview would be the last time they raise this issue...  This statement was also 'their truth' apparently
More from the whining Prince🤡
Lol at the horror movie sounding voice over 😅
Judas
BORING !!!
H&M treat their 18 months as working Royals like Brittney Griner's time in Russia or Jaycee Dugard or Elizabeth Smart's abduction/sexual abuse.  While they all wrote a book (or likely will), none of them ever went on this permanent circus of daily whining and rehashing.  They all moved on with their lives and any time they do pop up in the press they are helping/inspiring others.
😱😱😱😱😱😱
are you freaking serious???  Enough with these two idiots already!!!!   They lie constantly.  If you do any research, you can verify the lies.  They wanted privacy so bad, give it to them!!!!!
Are we supposed to feel sorry for Harry ? Living in a mansion in Cali ????? Please give me a break - stop complaining Harry your are privileged - stop talking and go enjoy your Netflix money
This prince is unbearably annoying. Making money out of trashing the Monarchy just because he does not get away with his own whims. Stop him now.
I really used to love Harry, but now he has become nothing more than a grown up complainer and blamer - blaming everyone else for his life. I really am not interested in watching, a grown man, living in a mansion, selling out his family, at the same time trying to make money off of them.  Grow up Harry and get a real job - stop complaining about everybody else. All the bashing and lieing seems to come from YOU and shows that YOU are the problem!
He backed a losing horse marrying Meghan. This is crazy to be doing these cheap interviews
Why didn’t royals protect h and m every bad press on w and k they respond but not for h and m. Silence is betrayal that’s the truth boom
Prince Harry details the woe and misery and horrifying racial trama he and Meagan  M🤮rkle have had to endure for the 10th time. Will Smith and Harry are tied for Cuck of the decade. 🐐💨💩 🌈
I love how they've used a voice over usually reserved for crime documentaries. This guy is a stooge being used by a manipulater. Save my comment for the future ✌️
Goshh this men whine whine and whine the same things over and over and over again …… He def mental sick
What Harry will not do to get attention backstabbing man shame on him
I don’t care about these people using their white privilege to play victimhood.
Now watch the British Media promote Harry's book leading up to the release for a week non-stop. Thanks to the haters 😘
🤢 Harry please stop talking !!! We can’t take any more wining - grow up !
Judas did you already collect your silver. Pathatic
William is basically Joffrey Baratheon from Game of thrones and Jason knauf is little finger winter came early for the U.K. trash tabloid media
When are they just going to shut up. Its done we don't need to hear it anymore.
I hope Anderson is more professional than what’s her name. Wish Sam Donaldson were here!
Remember when Harry and Meghan had to flee the UK after the royal family paid 35 million dollars for their wedding and hundreds of thousands of dollars for Meghan’s maternity clothes? The horrors they dealt with as they bravely boarded a private jet and flew to a secluded mansion. Those immigrants fleeing war torn countries with just the clothes on their back are so lucky they never had to deal with the nightmare Harry and Meghan dealt with.   Now when will these two finally stop crying about the big meanie royal family and FiNALLY move on with their lives? Why did they name their daughter after the big meanie queen who didn’t help them? How about giving up your titles and cutting the last ties to the royal family? No? Too much money in having a royal title to give it up I guess. Greedy untrustworthy weasels.
Well, Cooper's reputation will be gone.
Omg are we sick if this human?
The  Ginger  & the whinger’ are at it again  ,with the begging bowl Please . read my book  called " Pity party". is all about my life . How I am a Victim and been treated  growing  up in a palace.  "Why you the common fork do not know what hardship is   ." Get a life." !!!!!!! ... Do not want be apart of the Royal family  but want still use the Titles to plug everything . There no going back for Harry or Meghan . They are finished  in the Uk And  they both know this
More whinging and lies
Anderson cooper is not a journalist. hes a hack. lmao
I love the part where it is at someone else's house.... Again🤔🤣🤣
Anderson Cooper? How can that guy's first name possibly be Anderson?
Ahhh, Scar from Lion King.
Short clip  making hand gesture to prove his point , well either he's nervous or telling a few lies
Well done Harry. We love you and remain blessed forevermore. Shame on Haters.
Awesome you go for it harry.
Guess who won't be watching 60 minutes? Me.
I wonder if Anderson Cooper is going to point out the numerous inconsistencies in the Harkles story. I also wonder if he'll ask Harry why he caused so much distress to the Queen when Prince Philip was dying and during the Queens last years.
You must all be from England or some country under the monarchy with these distasteful negative comments.
Why would Anderson Cooper agree to interview this clown?
I would love to get some food journalist the question their claims and show their lies it’s also so choreographed by them to play the victims ! Totally pathetic 😡
Anyone who buys this victim whinge fest needs their head examined. These 2 have nothing left to sell 😡
Nobody cares! This is a real low point 60 Minutes, someone who´s not been everywhere telling the same story over and over again could have gotten this spot, someone who deserved it not these two priviliged rich narcissists.
Anderson Gooper Bottoming for Harry as all American media does
Did Anderson dress Harry for the interview? Unless Mr. Cooper is planning on asking "real" questions of Harry, then we are not interested.
😂😂😂 how much desperate he is
Can't wait to read their own kid's memoirs....talk about 'genetic' pain.  Raised by a raging narcissist and a simp for a dad. Isolated from both sides of their families. Well worth the wait.
If 60 minutes give Hasbeen a pass & let him spout his untruth bombs without challenge like Oprah did based on an entirrly scripted interview (faux PR promo) I'll never watch another one of their programs. They think they've got a scoop but they've made a grave error of judgement. The Prince of LIes will undermine the truthfulness & accuracy that people believe is inherent in all the 60 minutes docs if his nonsense goes without a squeak of contradiction.
"Thanks ",,,, for the Warning.. Make Sure turn over or turn my TV off  . 🤣
Sandwiched nicely between Catherine, Princess of Wales birthday. Nice one Harry. 🙄
More of the same stuff. You would think Harry was locked in an attic and forced to eat with the staff. You would think he was treated with disgust and hatred by his family.
I love watching this program in the UK, but all these comments about Harry people haven’t even seen the interview yet. Prince Harry found peace safety in the US after what happened to his mother and the media. how can you be so mean to somebody you never meet you don’t know just the main things you read on social media. If you don’t like them move on be kind.
More like 60 years of Harry documenting his explosive diarrhea
Harry will discuss the oppression upon gingers across the west and the struggles of peeling too easily in the sun   Coming up next week on ' please let me be a victim
Whatever
Well done, CBS, instead of starting the new year with hopes and positivity, you chose to open with such a despicable, petty, vindictive, and shameless being without any integrity or backbone loathed by the world over.
This whole prince harry and meghan saga is really hard to watch for me. Watching a son and a brother and a soldier betray his brother, father, King and country for a D-list woke actress, netflix and money is really tragic.
What a simp.
Oh ,no words,wish they had no words ,this is like a toothache, earache and diarrhoea all at the same time ,SHUT UP!!!!
Whine.....whine....whine....🙄
Why? What more could he possibly say? Meg will be on the sidelines couching him 😂
No interest in anything Harry has to say.  America is fed up with the arrogant duo known as H&M.  Why is CNN giving this guy airtime?  Please folks, don't watch and don't buy the book.  He's a traitor to his family and country. Hope Anderson does his job.
Happy birthday Princess Catherine! Jan 9th! 🎈🎂🎉🎈
I adore Anderson Cooper, but in this particular case I would take Megyn Kelly or Piers Morgan any day. Unscripted, of course.
Oh look, another interview from this pair who just want privacy. I'd hate to imagine how often we would encounter them if they weren't trying to be private.
"Watch Anderson cooper get markled on 60 minutes". It's going to be a softly softly Oprah style yet again. Very foolish of cooper to do this. Ask Oprah how that turned out 😀 She did only 72 engagements for the royal family!. She's rich beyond her dreams and certainly far beyond her talents but because they wouldn't do what she wanted, this Trainwreck of moaning has been going on for years now. She's out of the royal family longer than she was in it yet Harry continues with this bull. We should be allowed submit questions 😀.  1. Was she a yacht girl? 2. Why the psychotic jealousy of Catherine? 3. Why mock the queen while she was dying? 4. Why the disrespect for Prince Philip while he was dying? 5. Why have 18 of your staff members quit? Bullying maybe? 6. Why lie about Thomas snr? & That side of the family? 7. Why completely ignore the other side of your family? And on and on......... We all know the answers but no one will openly confront them.
Definition of the word privacy.  noun: privacy a state in which one is not observed or disturbed by other people. Or the state of being free from public attention. Guess they use a different definition in la la land.
God help the Uk when this loose lipped traitor puts us all in danger.
Another spin of from the winfry lie-fest. Still ,itl save those gullible people the cost  of buying the  spares  book of lies and fiction. Very apt name for ging is spare ,he did something right for a change, he should have looked  up the various meanings in the urban dictionary first.What a plonker!!
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
What an absolute waste of space Harry has become. And don’t get me started on the wife. Grifters, both of them. Don’t throw your money away on the ‘book’
60 Whinutes…just another cringefest. No thanks.
Enough already!!
Poor cry baby 😭 when Meg does the same hatchet job on him after she dumps him 😂
It is such a shame he is doing this to his mother who was a true humanitarian and colour blind it so well when she passed away I felt bereft even though I am South African I saw black men crying because they saw her true beauty in loving people regardless of colour he as her son is dishounering her by comparing his wife who spend two minutes in the uk and clearly showed all of us her disregard for the monarchy and the public i as a mix race South African living thorough apartheid was appalled at her use of Nelsinho Mandela and what he stood for so utterly false I say crying looking at him being release and smiling what a wonderful human he is my inspiration and she is demeaning that by comparing herself and her unwillingness to fit into protocol of his to behave into a family she showed no grace in his to behave with in-laws respecting other cultures your in laws she does not even like her own family I am so angry at her for wasting a opportunity to unite different races and cultures not so smart is she but we will as a people world wide overcome
why does the media try so hard to make me care about this guy?
This will be a totally scripted ‘ interview’. Harry and Meghan have so much to hide, they could never answer real questions😂
Most of us are tired of his whining and lying. He and his wife have a troubled relationship with the truth. He is a spoiled, immature man-child with mommy issues. His wife is a toxic narcissist and a bully. They were just voted the most annoying celebrities, coming in ant 1 & 2. We all know the questions had to be pre-approved so they will only be regurgitating the same lies they told on Oprah and their mockumentary.
Pathetic....
“ We want a private life “
When is it enough? How can someone be happy to constantly trash his family? It's just awful and sad! 😞
I won't watch it and won't buy the book.  A waste of time and money.
I thought he wanted privacy? Why the interview? Why the book? Why burning bridges with your family? Why?
Love Anderson, but how did he get suckered into this gig?? Have no respect, nor do not care for Harry, the professional victim/whiner-sold his family and the institute of the monarchy for a few pieces of silver. Spoilt, narcissistic man-child.
Samantha Markle fake accounts and her followers are burning with envy 😂. We love you Harry and Meghan.
Harry = Uber privileged habitual self victimizer attention addict .
And this couple wanted to live a quiet life in the USA and not be in the lime light; yet, Meghan and Harry are choosing to keep exposing their private life while living as Royals.  ( I wonder if they have other talents to make a living off from?)
So awkward,  and pleading even. 🥺 Harry must be in a Desperate corner
I seriously wonder what they are going to do for money when there are no more "stories" to tell. The bank of Pa is closed as the Duchy of Lancaster isn't worth as much as the Duchy of Cornwall, which is now William's. I mean with all these multimillion dollar deals they still haven't paid off their mortgage and their security costs are outrageous. Not to mention how much they spend on PR and staff only to get prepackaged voice overs for shelved projects. Invictus only survived the pandemic because William and Catherine gave it 500k.
Congratulations for giving this actual liar a platform. It’s well known in this country that Harry cheated in state exams in order to gain entry to Sandhurst military academy. Thick as a plank like his treacherous mother. By the way, his own mother called him the spare, but will he disparage her in any interview? Doubt it, because he makes money off her tragic death. Absolutely despicable. Lost any respect I had for 60 minutes or Andy Cooper. Long live the King.
They should talk about surrogacy - THAT would be interesting and worth watching. He should also ask: what does it mean for a charity to be transparent... Mister Cooper - Tom Bower is an investigative historian and amazing journalist - look up his book about them: Revenge: Meghan, Harry, and the War Between the Windsors and you would know the real deal. Asking scripted questions is not real journalism. Scripted, over rehearsed interview is only propaganda. 😕
I can atleastbstand Harry but his vile wofe I can't stand her annoying voice so as long as she doesn't make a cameo I might consider watching it for AC sake.
I love the part where 25 years from now Anderson’s sons Wyatt & Sebastian go to a foreign country and in exchange for millions of dollars conduct interviews about the  scathing “memoirs” they wrote which deviate wildly from the truth. The foreign host allows the Cooper boys unprecedented time and opportunity to slag off Anderson, his former lover and his mom, Gloria Vanderbilt. Then Anderson gets to find out during this interview that the boys chose this nuclear option solely because Anderson had put this idea into their little noggins back in 2023, by de facto treating this as an acceptable way to make dump truck loads of cash with no repercussions. Good luck with the example you’re setting for your kids, Coop. You’ll need it.
per rehearsed interview. how pathetic, won't be watching
Will he EVER shut up? No one will watch  They'll be enough honest critiques of this nonsense to bore even the best of us. Did Anderson Cooper learn NOTHING from the Oprah and Netflix disasters? YES. The idiots book will become a "bestseller", because it's being GIVEN away on so many platforms. Best seller lists are comprised solely on "units" (books) moved, NOT on what's actually sold. His wife is already sprucing HER memoir. The BRF are being proven right in ignoring these tantrum throwing idiots. Personally, I WANT them to turn up at KCIII coronation. Seated in the back row, irrelevant observers to history. Hopefully booed and iced out - AGAIN, while she obliviously shashays down in something expensively  inappropriate.  No jewelry. No tiara. No importance of any kind. And then, of course, will be the inevitable whinge-fest of how poorly they were treated... Totally irrelevant.
Desperate for attention. Not a nice look.
Why would CBS give that clown called prince harry an interview?  He is a disgrace to his grandparents and his father King Charles III.
I love the part where “Just Harry” and his wife cannot stop sharing their story of 18 months in the royal family 3 years ago … what more can they share (make up) !?!?
I will be watching.  I support Harry and Meghan’s exit from the UK and the demonic British Monarchy.
Oh please, Spare us!
Please NO MORE!!!!!
How can it be a "revealing interview" ...... we've heard all this same sh*t before, he and his toxic wife haven't stopped banging on about it for years, they recycle it when somebody offers them money  😂😂
I love the part when Meghan lets Harry wear the pants. So nice of her.
Thank god we'll be spared this drivel in the UK. Who with any intelligence can take ANY interview seriously where the questions are presubmitted for approval thus making it easy to rehearse the replies. Does he think we have the level of intelligence he has sadly displayed himself since leaving the protection of the "men in grey suits" that they both love to hate now?
Only 12k views….. looks like people are exhausted of prince Harry..l.
Open mouth.... insert foot....
You haters have no shame .no life and Brainwash by the tabloid.harry is a grown man with his own family leave him alone.he is not a mute and Puppet of the tampon king and his mistress.they are your hero haters. We love Harry and Meghan for what they stand.and wil always support them.and we are in many!!!!! Love always winnnnnnn
Lol spare us. Please. 😂
They really need a new PR team if they think doing an interview about his "explosive" memoir after the "explosive" interview with Oprah...and the "explosive" podcast...and the "explosive" documentary is a good idea. The only way this will be "explosive" is if Harry finally reveals where Meghan is keeping his balls.
Booo Whoo don’t raise your voice Anderson , & don’t pander to the woke people. Maybe just maybe he might do better than the Whatt interview.
Ask about the moonbumps and the fact there's no doctor's signatures attached to each alleged birth of the dolls. Cheers in advance, Andy!
I love the part where Harry explains why they are lying all the time and admits, that they are talentless and greedy and have nothing to offer than trashing their families and the legacy of QE. Spreading hate while preaching love. So brave. So compassionate! One tear, left eye!
The show is called "The never ending lies"? Give the badmouth a break!
Ohhh my god , grow up
Mediocre. Ridiculous. Ungrateful. Disloyal. A prince, really? No title can make him worthy.
I wish this dude would just stfup
Why would Anderson Cooper want to be associated with Just Harry?
Well the good news is that, by the comments, it looks like americans are just about done with this pair as us Brits are.
🤢🤮🤑🙄
What a waste of perfectly good air time …
Let him do a live interview, without approved question. Let him be interviewed by Piers Morgan or someone from GB news or the Australia news. If he think he is soooo right, why not do that. The dude is a mental patient, he kinda knows he is not truthfull
What a joke. Hairy Hazbeen. Old news. Whiner of the century. Not watching this bull. Love the Royal family. This traitor needs to be exiled for treason.
Another Harkle’s in inventerview?  Is 60 minutes running out of material? The real and good one???? 🤦🏻‍♂️👎
they make a cute couple...
OMGAWD! 😱😲 What next from this most despised pair of lying hypocrites??? 🤔🤦‍♀ They'll sell their blatant LIE$, born out of sheer jealousy and hatred, to any bidder for the right price. 😫😝🤮 KwaZULU Natal 🌍🦁South Africa
God bless you Harry ❤
Tom Bowers told the truth ❤️🙋‍♀️🇦🇺 Wonderful well researched book.....oh yeah must be true as Harry hasn't sued. 😁
they really do. do birds of a feather
Who is removing comments? I'll write it again. PLEASE CAN WE HAVE A SNEAK PREVIEW OF THE SCRIPT TO SAVE US AN HOUR OF PRECIOUS LIFE WE'LL NEVER GET BACK!
NOOOOOOOO! HAVENT WE SUFFERED ENOUGH??? CANCEL MY SUBSCRIPTION!
Trapped harry is  jobless . The way he earned for thier  living is to trashed his family where he got all the privileges , wealth and etc. He is a spoiled never grown  up man and supervised of his old worn out thing he married. Trapped harry is lost . He sold his soul and turned to a traitor  , ungrateful without dignity  loser .  Now he is a poisonous ugly frog he become.   SAD ... 😔
Really Anderson?
60 minutes too long
Well I'm glad it's only him
H has no proof of his wild accusations and he has proven himself to be a liar. He has different stories depending on who/when he's telling them to. Eg they got engaged in the cottage when they were roasting chicken... Then it's different on Netflix. He can't even tell the truth about simple little things. Why would anyone believe anything he has to say?!?!
Harry only want money lies story from 60 mintues baa bha
Hazzbeen tells the world how he, a poor little spare prince, and his wife Neverwas are yet again being mistreated by both their families and how all they want is privacy ...  while pushing his book to all the press.
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
I am so incredibly tired of those two trying to force feed us "stories" of their vicitmhood. It's an insult to actual victims of abuse. The more they talk, the less I like them. Even if every single thing they say were true, sniveling and whining constantly isn't what strong independent people do. Ever heard the phrase beating a dead horse?
Vote with your money by deciding book sales.
The problem is that almost everyone commenting on this page will watch the interview (as well as millions of others), which will then be seen as a rating success!! I will not and have not watched a second of their talk or read anything about them out of protest. I only come onto your channel as you are so good at summarising the crap
Stop giving this grifter attention
Oh my goodness 🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️
Il a vendu sa mère,  ses enfants, son père , son frère et son âme.
so much for not wanting to be in the limelight, cant wait until the shire votes to remove the Sussex name from their titles, they don't deserve it ,I  for one will be voting yes to draft 262 of the Sussex referendum
There have been other YouTubers who have suggested that Anderson Cooper was chosen by the Harkles because of his brother's suicide around 27 years ago, which he's still grappling with. Understandably so. The Harkles figured they could emotionally play Anderson Cooper with the MM 'supposed suicide attempt' where, an hour or so later on that same night, MM was the one grinning from ear to ear at the concert, while Harry was the one who looked like the one contemplating suicide. Yeah, well played Harkles. Trouble is, no-one will buy it, just like the Oprah & Netflix lie fest.
What more could there possibly be to reveal??
Good for Harry! Speaking on his life and setting the record straight!  Ignore the haters and bots! I, for one, will be watching the interview.
So many people getting triggered, wow. 🤣🤣🤣 Good luck Prince Harry,  with all that you do. It isn't easy for many people to understand the dysfunctional institution into which you born. They just assume you had ''everything'  and, therefore, shouldn't mention the abuse that clearly went on and goes on,  still to this day.
Cannot wait! Stick to'em Harry. #AbolishtheMonarchy
Oh for goodness sake- isn’t this just enough already?
From the very relaxed looks of it, there won't be challenging questions. It's more of a comfy conversation by the fire. Shame of a """journalist""".
What a waste of a show.
I honestly thought when they left UK they will try maximum avoiding media because Harry always mentioned what his mum went through...but now upside down they even ready to sell their personal photos , videos to media ...I don't judge but really surprised .....
I just want to write… I don’t care. Why does anyone? Just a royal simp and his narc wife.
Enough already with these friggin' people
I sometimes feel News Media interfere too much in people lives! Let them be normal people like all of us! Harry should be a History 3rd Grade teacher ! He would have all the histories ! I still think Harry should be a teacher!
Surprised that Anderson will lower his standards to interview Harry with prearranged questions. Everything that Harry and Meghan touch crumbles. Hope Anderson doesn't lose credibility. Harry is so arrogant and inarticulate. It seems like a lose-lose situation.
Wonder who flew a private jet for this pretend interview.  Hope Anderson asks him why he and Meghan have lied so much.
The comments here are all from that small group of paid off people who spread falsehoods. Bitter low-lifes.
Again? A REVEALING interview? Oh no... This never ends. Regurgitating the same old lies.
The Royal family is his only currency.  Doesn’t sound so free.
Step brothers  2
Hope we don’t have to hear again about how terrified he was when his brother yelled at him at the palace 🤡  The interview and his book drops right around Catherine’s birthday. Lol
That's a shame 😦 I promised to watch my goldfish swimming around the tank next Sunday 😂
Let’s see…he’ll talk about his mum’s death, how hard he’s been done by, how unfair life is because he was born second in line, backstab his brother and sister in law, whinge about not getting his own way, mention his mum again…
Live to lead fight for change fight racism against the royal family. God will bless Meg and Haz, ashamed their enemies and have scandals pop-up like never before.
God will protect Haz and Meg and have scandals pop-up
Maybe if he had something to talk about besides being mad that he's only a millionaire instead of a billionaire
Is 60 minutes going to challenge or edit out all of Harry's lies?  Oprah got caught allowing misrepresentation of the factual truth being published on her watch...
Just get over yourself! You were born second, in a family where you either stay second and support the heir or you move on, leave the family and do your own thing. Why moan, no one is going to shift the 1000 year old monarchy posts for you. Prince George’s siblings will have to do the same one day - support their brother and the monarchy in a supporting capacity or move on. How hard is that? No one owes you anything.
this bum should get a real job, only thing he's capable of is squandering his and others reputations
Oh ugh. Not another whine fest. And Anderson Coioer won't ask him any hard questions or challenge his lies and so Haz will live to lie another day.
"Revealing interview" I think NOT, especially when all the questions have been approved by Mrs Markle.
Hi Anderson 😘
I hope Anderson Cooper hits him with some hard questions. Notice Meghan isnt there?
Are you going to ask why his wifes fake bump fell all the way to her knees??? Why it kept changing sizes up and down from day to day??????????
Who else thinks this will be softball practice?
And so it continues. How much more of this! I’m over those two drop kicks.
LET'S GIVE THEM FOR ONCE THE PRIVACY THEY DESPERATELY SEEM TO CRAVE ALREADY!!!! ENOUGH OF THESE 2 🤡🤡!!!
I think everyone needs to boycott this show now and give 60 minutes abysmal ratings. Enough is enough. There needs to be consequences for entertaining this drivel.
I love the part where Anderson can only ask questions that Harry has approved in advance.
Prince Harry + Invictus Games ❤️❤️❤️
"Explosive" new memoir... Hazbeen and his trashy wife have been tangling the same "explosive" tune for three years now. Despite the multitude of interviews, books, and podcasts, neither one says anything explosive or new. 60 Minutes and Anderson Cooper are just helping these two pathetic human beings regurgitate more of the same old word vomit. Rest assured, I and my family will not be watching.  Bad form, CBS... bad form.
One day before Princess Catherine's birthday. The Harkles are pathetic, jealous and bitter little people.
Why are they matching?
Oh FFS 🤦‍♀️ Let it go! Go live your damn life.
It will be the same old complaints. How about you both get real jobs and live like the rest of us
You go Harry👌👌
Oh. My. God. They really are living off this.
1 week b4 Ginge blows himself completely up. Prediction: His wife will leave him then b/c he'll no longer have value & will trade "her story" with a whole new set of "truths". He will be broken with nowhere to turn/run anymore when this falls down. Quite sad if I gave a crap about him. Which I really don't lol. I do think harrys wife deserves the reaping of the crop she has sown
60 mins to be lost
I hope it’s a real interview.
You have ro wake up from your so called wife!
NICE !!!Get the media establishment under the bus. Good for him!!!
Yes please promote your victim mentality for the world to see...show us the envy of your brother and how everything was just fine until a narcissist entered the fray pretending to be that soul mate....funny how he's living the life she wanted surrounded by attention and not the life he dreamed of away from the lens.....
Whining 40year old ! Get a life
I can't wait.  Thank God I'm off work that day 🙌🏿 🙌🏿🙌🏿
I have high respect towards Anderson. As his motto goes, "keeping it honest".
Of course he has to appear everywhere. After living most priveliged life on this planet, where no-one even couldn't look directly in eye to you. Every country leader bowing to you without doing anything for anyone in whole life time.  How else these so called "victims" would get their story out.  They say they don't want any royal titles.  But are entitled to all royal money and still want titles for their kids.  So they don't have to live out normal life.  Without having a job living and affording POTUS like security wherever they go,  I fail to understand what job are they doing.  They are still living on royal expense.  Liberal elite perfect example, shouting to be real victim while putting real victims to shadows without any help.  HYPOCRITICAL OF THEM TO SAY THE LEAST.
I still believe Anderson is a real professional and has high standards. He will definitely know how to go about doing this interview.
At this point, people are only interested because it’s like a train wreck in slow motion.  You can’t stand it, but you still want to see the destruction of two people who are so woefully self unaware, it boggles the mind.
Give it a rest Hazmat. It’s exhausting 😫
I loved the part where they thanked all of the people they had to step on along the way:  Queen Elizabeth, even as she was dying from cancer The Nigerian people UK legal system  Thomas Markle King Charles  Harry's wife's black family Tyler Perry The black drag queen whom she wouldn't be caught dead in public with The people of Sussex Poor kids from NY Oprah  The South African people Harry's wife's Canadian friend Diana's corpse Harry's nephew at 4 years old on his birthday People of Malta when she didn't want to be black The guy who loans them the jet Nelson Mandela's legacy Harry's extended family who were not invited to the wedding to cover for her lying to her niece Palace staff Harry's manhood  Her niece whom she uninvited to her wedding  Wounded veteran athletes Montecito staff Children of Uvalde The veterans Harry ditched to beg Bob Iger for a job for his wife Prince Philip on his deathbed The people of Dumbarton The first director of their documentary  Harry's children's legacy Sunshine Sachs for 2m Harry's 3 year old niece at the wedding Samantha Markle Harry's friends Canadian Royal Police Black Americans  Prince and Princess of Wales
Hoping cancel culture kicks in and does its thing for Megan & Harry Markel in 2023 🤞
Harry trashes his brother who had the absolute temerity to be born first!
Do Harry and Megan Markle ever stop talking about themselves and what victims they are? At this point who cares?
Barbara Walters left us too soon! Now THAT is a 60 minute interview I would pay to see!!
Hahahahahahaha, of course he is.  When you need a fake interview, call Cooper.  Harry is such a Cuck and this is a joke
Dear 60 minutes, why are you lowering your standards? Why do you have this proven liar on your show? Shame on you.
Happy New Year.  I  can  hardly wait.
OMG the sugars are out in force, wonder why? 😅😂😂😂
It will be like Oprah......they dont do interviews. They have a list of questions pre prepared and rehearsed. Its  a joke calling this an intreview its just another I will bend reality to suit my narrative. Would love for an actual hard hitting journalist to ask them questions but it will never happen .....
No one cares... Will not be wasting my time on Prince Harry the loser..
Sorry to see Anderson Cooper bow a knee to these whinging traitors. There’s only so much you can beat this dead horse.  The empty vessels make the most noise is a phrase that springs to mind.
Omg give it a test already? Harry is shameful
Please don’t.
Wow !!! What is new? My mum died, I can never be king and I resent that but I am a victim because I am no longer receiving my daddy’s allowance…. did I tell you that my mum died? …. the media is evil! My black wife is harassed by the media, and my mum died….
Harry…what next? You are sounding more immature and whiny with every interview you do..losing credibility by the minute
I’m so sick of Harry and MeGain. Stop!
how many big revealing interviews is he gonna have? oprah, netflix, the today show, its never ending.
Haha he carnt  string a sentence  together  lol haz beens book will  be in every toilet  no point wasting money buying  the book of lies haha
Now I know what not to watch . Is this the best with all that’s happening in the world?
Lifestyles of the rich and famous.  😉
I order the book! I watched Doc series....I Looooved it. Thanks AC
Ahh the former Royal Prince who married an actress and became a frog. Albeit an extremely wealthy frog. Flying in private jets, living in his huge mansion. Tough life for whining  Haz. You made your bed. You chose to leave. No more Royal work for you. You got what you wanted.
🤣. Hasn’t he figured out no one is interested?  If you really want someone to be interested, do a real interview where the hard questions get asked.      Puff interviews are boring.  Winners are boring.
Yay! Cant wait
Seriously, who gives a dam??
No thanks, I prefer non-fiction viewing entertainment. This one will be too out there for my liking, can't relate at all. Not down to earth. Belongs in fiction genre under Aberrations of Delusional Reality, I believe.
Maybe it's my age .. 80 soon .. but all these negative judgments are discouraging. I trust Anderson to have a good interview. I appreciate much about all the royal family. Wouldn't want to be them. Wish them well.
He we go again..... And again.. And again...... And again....... And again....... He's told his poor me so many times...cant really feel sad for a spoiled millionaire making money by trashing his family....
Ugh.  When will the "self-pity party" end?  And for those of you hosting this charade? Jump off the burning bandwagon already!
ffs are you kidding, when is this madness going to end!
OMG why?  Suspect I’ll be washing my hair @ that time.
Another lieathon being dressed up as his truth   In his monotone voice still whinging for three long boring years A rich middle aged brat   No thanks !!!
Come on Prince Harry! Let's get this New year started! I hope he hands William his Karma. I can't wait.
Wish they would STOP giving him TV time. He is spoiled whiney baby brat.
60 minutes of whining and complaining and will not be worth watching
Nobody cares…😑
Boring , don't care if it's the truth ,his truth as haz has been nothing but a liar for 3 years, still playing the poor little rich princess whom is still suffering from not being the next king
"60 Minutes...offering hard hitting investigative reports, interviews." We shall see, but I HIGHLY doubt it! 🙄
They seem to do more whining than serving. They should change their mantra: Whining is universal.
Good thing the crybabies removed the dislike tally.  Thousands...
I wonder if he vetted the questions first.
Anderson is a good interviewer so we'll see.
What is Anderson doing??? Why are you even pushing this propaganda after all that this "Prince" is getting his family to? O gosh!!!?? Can this things with Horried just stop???
More exclusive new revelations? MAKE IT STOP!
Gross.
If you genuinely care about this, you should be sent to Ukraine for 3-4 months. Upon your return you will lose your right to vote and be forced to undergo a lobotomy so hilarious that The Kennedys would come back to life simply to laugh at you for no more than 17 seconds.
Harry's "truths".  If Harry doesn't have enough material he'll just make it up, after all lthis is Hollywood - the land of Harvey Weinstein, Bill Cosby, Amber Heard, and the Disney catoon fairy tale princess  Meghan Markle.
Not for me, too many made up stories.
Oh dear lord….60 minutes of more whining from the most privileged professional victim🤮🤮🤮
Prince Harry shouldn't be a prince and Meghan shouldn't be a princess. They're a total disgrace to the good people of England. They say they want a private life. This isn't private. It's about the money and selling out on your family. Just like many people in the Royal family. When you're broke, write books and dirt on your family.
MONSTERS is a good channel, certainly more interesting than this drivel!
Oh please... Someone spare us from listening to the "spare" Nor do I trust Anderson "glow in the dark" Cooper... He's just as bad. Oh well... Thanks for the warning...movie night next Sunday!!!
Just goes to show that a formerly reputable programme like 60 Minutes has gone down the toilet.
Harry and his HORRIBLE wife should just disappear. She has completely ruined him. The fact that he's not related to Charles and is only William's half-brother is the only thing interesting about him anymore.
More word salad???? Aren't we stuffed? Stop shoving it down!
I love them! I can’t wait to watch it!
tired of these two.. same story..  unrelatable to the average person..  please exit and have a quiet life.
Does anyone realize this woman will dump this dork for the Antichrist to spawn his seed??? They both get what is coming .
Cooper wouldn’t have job if it wasn’t for his mommy…..
Anderson Cooper has a body of outstanding work to his credit. After the “completely unscripted” Harpo “interview” and the Netflix mockumentary, I’m amazed AC is lowering his standards to what will almost certainly be still more whining, whinging, and outright lying.
Harry was treated better and given privledges that no other non-direct heir was ever given and it was " All " due to the tragic death of his mother, Diana.   Like Charles did, William could have just started a foundation on his own in his early twenties, but he didn't ,,,, he included Harry along with him so he didn't feel left out  It was  ONLY through the royal backing and power of that Foundation that Harry was able to launch the Invictus Games so quickly.. HE SHOULD ACKOWLEDGE THAT FACT.  HE SHOULD ALL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE CONCEPT OF THE GAMES ORIGINATED WITH THE WARRIOR GAMES.   William has been a kind and caring brother to Harry through childhood and adulthood.  He asked Harry to slow down with Meghan because he knew how difficult it would be for her to acclimate to royal life and british culture.  Harry refused to listen. He's arrogant, delusional,  completely ungrateful for the privledges given him and an incredibly immature man.  I feel very sorry for William.... he doesn't deserve the brother Harry has turned into.   Thank God the UK has William, he will make a great King someday.  I truly hope Anderson Cooper conducts the interview with journalistic responsibility, unlike Oprah.  I think he'll pay a price if he doesn't.
Used to like 60 Minutes.  Apparently, they have gone woke and no one needs that.  How much longer are we going to have to listen to a 38 YO man whine about not being the first born????  He and his wife are trash.  No class, no morals, illogical, irrational, immature bullying brats.  SHAME on 60 Minutes for airing this sheet!!!!
Very funny to read comments by people who claim they couldn't care less. When you don't care, you just keep scrolling. You make a negative comment when you care enough to be triggered.
🤢🤮
I wonder if Oprah has a bee in her bonnet about Anderson interviewing Harriet?
I Love Anderson Cooper, but Harry? Spare me this time Anderson!
FFS just make it stop. I couldn't care any less about an antiquated system where the people give tons of money to a family for them to live way better than the people and they give nothing back to humanity in return.  They are completely irrelevant  in the 21 century and waste money.
Such a BORE!
Traitor and Treason.  Just SHUT UP, Harry!
No plans of watching this ginger, it's just another whine fest.🙄 We all know how insanely JEALOUS he is of Prince William.
They make a cute couple, don't they?  Birds of a feather...
Wow. 60 minutes of complaining about wanting privacy? Trashing his father who gave him millions of dollars to live in the country of his choice with the woman he loves… only the boring 60 minutes would find this worth anyone’s time… certainly not any thinking person’s!
Now Anderson Cooper’s gonna get “Markled.” Hasn’t he learned that everything they touch turns to 💩?
Well another reason to not watch 60 mins again really starting to get annoyed with 60 minutes go woke go broke .
Lol, he gunna keep talking while -Maleficent- Meghan is ohh so proud!
I heard that the questions that Anderson is asking is of course approved by megnuts and hazbeen. Another bs story...........
WHO CARES!!!!!!!
Short cut: Me mum died, racist family, William yelled at me, and Pops took away my allowance, media bad—-don’t miss THAT irony😆—-must protect me family.  Now no one needs to watch!
If u watch them.. they'll keep milking appearances on whatever show will have them, forever whining about their posh, selfish  lavish..lives.
Why can't they just call him "Harry"? Remember, he took a freedom flight! He is just good old Harry now 🤨
Prince of what …..
Can't wait to see who he's going to bash. His hate, jealousy and rivalry against his own brother make him look like the problem. Harry turned out to be a very calculated man. His marriage to Meghan was planned and plotted to sabotage a monarchy wherein his brother will reign. I'm sure Megain was all for it. She need the fame, money and notorioty she struggled to achieve. That pair is just evil! I don't know how people fall for their bs.
How much more has he got to lie about...who cares...Does he not have a life...get a real JOB
Will these blow hards ever shut up??
No. Go away
Walking Dead ...
My God... I didn't think it was possible to care about something so little.
He gets it from his Momma, and I'm here for it! Thank goodness he's not like his father.
How  much longer are these two going to milk this  victimhood. Prince Harry “chose” to marry a woman who would “feed and support” his resentment “He has chosen to publicly criticise his family for treating him as the ‘spare’ not the ‘heir’.”
Guevon !!
I watched part of their ridiculous documentary. I kept thinking what exactly do you want us to do? Cry? They were narrating their “TRAUMATIC” escape from monarchy like two refugees from Syria. I’m sorry, but I have a very hard time feeling bad for someone who leaves a palace for a 13 bedroom mansion in montecito on a private jet. I feel awful for the families risking their lives at the Mexican border, Ukraine, etc. But these two, not at all
What a joke of a “news” show, how far are you willing to fall 60 minutes?
Yaaassss Prince Harry!!! Yassssss!!!
In the words of Peter Griffin......"oh my god, who cares"
Wow the vitriol in these comments is staggering. Imagine defending a historically racist, freeloading monarchy that serves no purpose but to suck funds from the UK. Way to show your misognoire and highlight just how morally bankrupt you are.
@pdina look the spare wants to say something ! Harry freedom of speech doesn’t mean we care !
I prefer Prince Shaved
I for one will not be watching. Shame on 60 minutes. He moved out for peace and quiet now he runs around like a whiny little overgrown brat. No thank you.😢
Giving them another platform to tell lies and cry about being rich and loved, not interested in any of the bs they’re peddling. Shame on Anderson Cooper for lowering his journalistic integrity for a puff piece.
So done with this!
Boooooooooo!!!
what a shame
The ungrateful son. Turned on his own family over a woman that's not even worth it.
He is not anymore Prince
Tried to get in before the UK people making a personality out of hating meghan markle for the same reasons they “love” Diana, but here they are in all their shining glory
More crying..
But I thought he gave up royalty?..
That hairline of his just keeps going farther back. Wonder if she wears the pants in the marriage
What a sell out
More whining gee can’t wait.  That’s a damn lie I CAN WAIT, I CAN WAIIIIIT! 😂
