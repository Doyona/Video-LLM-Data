Oh Rich today had to hurt!!
Looking back at this all almost two years later, 2023 really was the Jets best chance. The defense regressed in 2024. Aaron Rodgers put up average QB stats. If he hadn't gotten injured, one would imagine that he would've at least put up above-average play and combined with the 2023 defense, the Jets could've made it to at least the divisional round.
The HOPE of the voodoo and the witchcraft stuff my friend knows which all those fans that don't like me being a fan they treat me different things to my friend. I hate her, my so-called friend that I'm not friends with her I look like a freak. 💚💛💚💛
There is another universe on some different dimensional plane where Eisen, having witnessed the Jets' dominance of the NFL for the past two decades, looks at the signing of Aaron Rogers as kind of gilding the lily.   "It's too much," he says into his microphone. "I have to admit, I'm kind of tired of all the winning. If the Patriots had been winning this long, the NFL would be interesting; I'd have something to complain about. There would be drama and conflict. There wouldn't be this sense of inevitability every fall, where every other team slumps its shoulders, going through the motions, knowing the Jets are going to get to the playoffs and roar to the Super Bowl again, and win, unless the Giants are there to remind us the football gods still exist. I love Aaron Rogers, great player, but on the Jets? It's too much."  I think our Rich Eisen is tougher, and has a better character. His suffering has tempered him.  But maybe he should think about rooting for someone else. It might be time.
Scatman was the head chef not a caretaker…this is why the Jets suck…no intelligent fans
The Jets could hire Wolverine as QB and fate would find a way to knock him out for the season.
If your putting your faith, hopes, dreams, and future on a 39 year old....in the NFL..."THAT'S ON  YOU"! 😮
I was watching the game in the college food court, saw it happen. I was on twitter immediately, scrolling for updates just going "Theres no fucking way. Theres no fucking way man."
You call it a horror movie, I call it karma
Best thing to happen to the Jets all season long. They were able to keep their #1 pick, moved back one spot and got a 4th and a 5th, draft a top LT and 4 starters, including finally their franchise QB, and signed another UFA starter.
Vinny? Omg!
How long before rodgers gets injured this year?
I love Rich, goes on this rant about his Jets but there is an issue with the Falcons signing Cousins and drafting Penix Jr.
The Jets aren't smart enough to have Joe Willy as the honorary Captain. Nope.
Rodgers should have worried about the O - Lineman instead of getting his receiver friends on the team. I thought he knew how to build a team considering he always blamed The Packers GM?
This was such a great start to the scripted reality show that is the NFL.
Left that game the second the fans started cheering for Zach Wilson in complete delusion
jets fans don't get to also be yankee fans..... you cant be half way miserable...   you gotta be 100% miserable and be a mets fan... and yes the knicks are allowed...
Lmao 😂😂😂the Jets suck 😂😂😂
That was a legendary rant 😂
TOM TUPA TOM TUPA
*5 snaps
NARDS
Best rant ever!
Jets and Chargers doomed forever. Lesson: don’t ever be a 2nd team in a major city. U officially the side b**** n sneaky link. Fate does not work in ur favor long term 🤷‍♂️
Next time the owner can not be so cheap and spend some money on real grass for their expensive QB
Jets are just cursed 💀👿😂😂😂😂😂
Don’t want to see players injured, but as far as the Jets are concerned 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Wait...wait. Look at the tape. Rodgers is hit. Stands up...looks over to the sideline for 30 SECONDS listening to whomever say whatever to him in the helmet...THEN he decides to "lay down" and complain. I don't trust today's football for nothing.
1) I've been a Rich Eisen fan for as long as I can remember, going back to his ESPN days.  He's thoughtful, funny, intelligent.   2) I hate to see any athlete suffer any serious injury because they work extremely hard (most of them, anyways) and have skills/talent that I will never posses; 3) Get over yourself Rich!!! I've been a Red Sox fan for 50 years and suffered, along with other Sox Nation fans, decades of failure.  For decades we had to listen to arrogant New York fans chant "1918" and moronic "experts' say: "oh, the Red Sox fans don't really want to win it all.  They want to keep losing.  They wouldn't know how to act if the Red Sox suddenly won."  And the majority of this was disseminated by arrogant, obnoxious New York fans.  So, yes, it is tragic that AR blew out his Achilles: but it couldn't have happened to a better fan base.
It's time that Roders realizes his career is over.
Aaron Rodgers, welcome to the Jets.
God must really dislike Jets fans. 😂 sorry guys
Dude’s got a cadence like Obama
A guaranteed $75 million wasted on 4 snaps of the football.
A New York Jets fan and a Michigan fan. No wonder he is always crying.
Damn! Get it out, Rick! Just damn...
When Aaron came in and to be the guy. DD80 and would were leaders. Al Harrison. Donald and wood were out for the super bowl. It still mattered that they were there.
We don't get enough Scatman Crothers references these days, so glad Rich was able to get one in; quite an apt reference as well.
If Aaron Rodgers don’t play for the Packers! He doesn’t play for NOBODY! 👏🏼🥰👏🏼🥰💚🧀🏈🧀💚👏🏼🥰👏🏼🥰
My biggest issues: jacking up the prices for less packs and STILL including the same amount of multiple copies of some trash common in a pack, and reprinting everything to the ground. Otherwise, I’m good. I sure as hell ain’t buying boxes anymore. Not since Phyrexia.
Cross Body BLOCKS on JET offensive line are you kidding! Not to blame offensive line is Ridiculous!!!
Calm down ...they "kept" it together because they're not use to having Rogers... so him going put on the 4th play on the 1st game made 0 difference
Jets fan ? Try being a Charger fan.Ack!!
All time rant
The only way the jets have a chance is if they are a 2000 Ravens incarnate. I think they have the tools, but we’ll see.
Alternate title: Jets fan Snaps on live TV
I thought about hard knocks and Aaron had a  WHOLE SEGMENT of him picking up grass and tossing it in the air😢😪😔🤢
39 years old.  1 for 5 in conference championships (in his prime).  The AFC has never been stronger.  This wasn't going to be the Jets year.
But arent aging players prone to injury?  Hopefully he recover so he can retire playing.  Fans and media need to get back to reality when it comes to aging players.  Father Time is undefeated.
Rich is the GOAT of grief
You won the game though...
Rex ryan had the jets cookin too doe
As a closeted Browns fan, we feel your pain ..😢
This is the worst ive felt as a Jets fan since 99
Rich. I gave this video a like as a show of support for your work, not in support of this topic.  One of the most devastating injuries in sports history.  I feel ya, man.  😢
I’m not a jets fan, so I’m not to familiar with their history, but now even I feel bad for their fan base. Lol. Best of luck to Rodgers on his recovery and good luck to the Jets on the season!
The Jets have somehow offended the gods. There suffering is never ending.
24th anniversary of Vinnies achillies tendon.  Testaverdes #:16 Rodgers #:8 16+8= ?
Its a complete shame that even with a guy like Chris Strevler on the roster for a few years, and even getting mentioned on the program... even being remembered at all... That they dont even know about somebody like Nathan Rourke currently on the practice squad for the Jags... nobody does... Paid NFL Pundits dont even know that the CFL exists... Some talking heads were on ESPN like a month ago talking about a hypothetical "G-Leauge" for the NFL, but nothing like it even existing..."   You could pick him up for absolutely nothing right now, you could play a seasons worth of film for your locker room, and your fanbase if you market him properly, and show them some of his playmaking ability, and atleast have a guy who's played some real ball after college, for a pro team, and has some legitimate,, real life upside... He's played so well straight out of the gate, in a new league with new rules compared to American Football...and he's got enough fundamentals, and was a clear cut talent above the rest of the leagues QBs, except one 33ish year old league vet...  He's good enough to create some plays out of nothing... while he has enough of a head on his shoulders that he could game manage a football team in an EXTREMELY similar way that the 49ers ask from Brock Purdy... The jets are in almost identical situation in some ways.   Atleast to bring Nathan in as the backup under Wilson....Like Brock was the third stringer under Trey Lance...You bring him in with the main goal of "not losing games" -  Instead of creating something out of nothing, like youre asked to do on a bad/mediocre team...  Again, it felt like a big gamble that nobody took Rourke when the Jags decided to drop him to the practice squad... Jets could scoop him up right now, and have somebody who you could market to the fanbase as somebody who has *only gotten better and better" as hes progressed from College, to being too good and too young to stay in the CFL after his rookie season with the BC lions, and then signed with the jags after the CFL season ended, and impressed in limited preseason action with the Jags...   Somebody who has game film that fans dont know about, but somebody that gives them HOPE, over any of these other options being listed that have already had their chances... Nick Foles is the only other name that could inspire some hope imo, as he has the Superbowl win over a tom brady/Bill Belichek pats team... thats about it...  You dont find the next young qb like a Brock Purdy, if the 49ers called up Joe-Blough McBackupski once they lost Jimmy G and Trey Lance...
I only knew Zach Wilson from the overplayed clip from last season at his lowest moment. Watching Hard Knocks I really like Zach. Don't think Monday Night is the way to win in the NFL. You can't count on winning games that way every week.
A performance that "popped" nothing.
Sorry Rich. As you know, anything that seems too good to be true probably is.
I was looking forward to this clip a lot more in the second quarter than I was at the end of the game.
Billionaire owners too cheap to have real grass. The greed of America has been its undoing.
That’s a great “what if” in NFL history… what if Vinny doesn’t get hurt that day…
So heartbroken for Rodgers, Jets, Jets fans. Somehow it helps to commiserate with Rich.
The Jets once used a 1st round pick on a fullback. The franchise is toxic. Run away free agents, rookies, and anyone with a family.
God bless you Jets and Bears fans  I  dont know how you keep on.
We needed help on the offensive line but we missed out on Jones; do we take the next best lineman available? No, we take another edge rusher. Anton Harrison gave up two QB pressures in his first game; not great but not bad for a rookie. How would he have fared against Floyd? We kept hearing all through camp that Brown, 38 and with declining skills, would be ready; he wasn't.
The jets deserve all the misery and much more for the BS they pulled stealing Parcells during our superbowl run. May they dwell on the celler of the afc east forever!
This is a grown man. Ranting about a game. In 2023.
You know, when 5 million people are praying, "Oh God, please let Namath come through against the Colts.  If the Jets never win another championship, please, God, let Namath come through!".  God listened.
Tough luck rich.
This rant is so good that, as a MIAMI fan, I’ve got almost sympathetic with the Jets fans’ misery. It would be fun to see Tua, Allen and Rodgers duking it out for the division. Wishing the best recovery to Aaron
This is the most Jets thing to happen but the best Jets thing to happen would be that Zach Wilson improves a lot & they win the Super Bowl without Aaron Rodgers lol
Screw the Anti-White far-left NFL but don't give up on Rodgers, Jets fans.  I'm a Packers fan (former cause the entire pro sports industry are all far-left woke liberal turds) so I wanted to see Rodgers play there.
Da Jets are just like Da Bears. And then the Patriots & Packers are usually ahead of the 2 other teams.
As a Lions fan for over 20+ years I obviously cant compare griefs, but being a Lions fan has been pretty miserable for a long long time lol..I cant Imagine how a Jets fan feels or how Browns fans have felt...future looks bright for the Jets tho.
As a Colts fan I can relate bc on August 28th 2019 we had SB hopes and expectations then on August 29th 2019 he quit out of nowhere after a preseason game. Then we colts fan went to SB hoped to I hope we get the first draft pick so we won’t be in QB limbo for 5 seasons. Different circumstances but same gut punch feelings.
Nobody with any decency, packer fan or not, would have ever wanted to see anything like this happen. This is such a cruel hand of fate. So sorry.
Why does he shout and speak so weirdly???
The jets were corrected..sir
Rich, this is a safe space. Everyone here loves you and wants to see you be happy and healthy.
Greta defense goes a long way with a not so great QB - think 2000 Ravens D and Trent who????  4 or 5 weeks without scoring an offensive TD!  It can be done
I was a Greg Norman fan....so, I think I'm qualified to understand Rich's pain.
Kinda worried that the win was just salt in the wounds. To show the potential that this team had before they lost Rodgers and they slowly watch Wilson melt down as the season progresses
The ghost of Joe Walton interfered and called that OT draw play.
I was at the season opener in ‘99, as I was on Monday Night. When they trotted Vinny out for the coin toss, I nearly lost it. 5 min later, Rodgers went down. Rich nails the emotions I felt. I sat there in disbelief for about a quarter before the Jets weened me back play by play. Was the best game since the Monday Night Miracle. Such an emotional night.
Jags fans know exactly how you feel.  Nick Foles is NOT Aaron Rodgers. However Foles was our "new hope" and he didnt even last a quarter.   Rodgers was your new hope, and didnt even get a drive!  I dont like Rodgers, but i feel for Jets fans, ive been there.
This is EPIC!
Rich's rants are gold. A beauty to behold. Definitely deserving of some kind of award 🤣😂🤣. Oh the drama 😂🤣😂
Jets lose their starting QB, "Do you know what its like to lose your QB and your season ruined"  49er Fans: 😐
Now Jets fans all know how it felt to be a Colts fan when Luck suddenly left us! It sucks!!
Yeah you poor guys are cursed 😢
Peyton Manning broke the Lions curse, maybe you can bring him in to help appease the football gods in the Jets favor too 😅
So I feel like the answer to "what do the football gods want" is pretty obvious. Namath sold his soul for a ring. We must ritual sacrifice him now to reverse the curse
JETS fans are not allowed to have nice things...
Ironically this is the kindest outcome for Jets fans. Now they can fantasize. They can imagine what could have been, instead of *knowing* the organization would blow it the old fashioned way.
Relax im a Lions fan; now we have really  suffered!
BRADY IS NOT COMING!! GET OVER IT RICH! 😂
I truly feel bad for Jets fans
It give me great joy to see Rich so upset. 😂😂😂. GFY Rich
I wonder if that bar in Wisconsin is going to keep the free bar tab with every jets loss promotion now
This comes as no surprise to me. Rogers had been looking for that last big contract for the last several years, showing little loyalty to green bay. Well, thats what you get with these older qbs, when you roll the dice . Enjoy your 75 million rogers
Not just bad for the Jets, but for the league.   I made a joke to my family a month ago that Rodgers will be lucky to last 5 games with that O-line. I didnt think itd be this bad. Unreal.
Mr Rodgers: what a wonderful day in the neighborhood wonderful day in the neighborhood
All us Jets fans knew it would somehow end in disappointment, just not that soon.
That was one of the most entertaining games ive ever watched  ( after i cried & puked of course  )
You think the jets and giants opt out for real grass now?
Maybe this is the Bledsoe injury revisited...
Jets curse is real. Im not superstitious but they really need to get an Exorcist to check the field , locker room etc just to be sure
It is just a game….  Sorry for Rodgers.  Hope he recovers quickly.  Great talent.  Don’t take this stuff so seriously.  Watch the game.  Enjoy it at the time.  Get over it.  Why do football fans have to dwell on every play every day until the next game.  Don’t even get me started about all the crazy obsession during the off season, especially during the draft.  Really?  Watching TV to see somebody get their name called to be a part of a football team?  Ain’t ya’ll got something better to do?  Man if you are 10-11 years old, I get the obsession, but geez….  Grow up.  Look.  I played HS football and HS baseball.  Really like both sports.  At some point you have to realize this is just a game to be enjoyed at the moment.  Gives you a helluva lot of time to do other things, most of them a lot more meaningful than dwelling on what overpaid athletes do, once a week…
Rich, quit your damn crying. I'm a Vikings fan. Compared to what we have experienced, you have zero clue what true pain is
Pure gold
As WSH fan, I get feeling universe is against us, Are the Jets the Charlie Brown attempting to kick football of the NFL? I thought of you Rich since you brought sports to GenX, we are praying you guys get an answer and ARod eventual return
What about the fact that the Twitter account that predicted Aaron Rodgers’ injury was suspended?
5 snaps if you count his Achilles, Rich.
Ill trade that win for Aaron Rodgers Game 2 Vs Dallas....
Until jets fans aren’t so entertaining after a loss the Football gods will continue to curse them for humor.
And I used to admire Keith olberman on ESPN but after his tweet on rodgers, I mean really
16 (Vinnie) - 4=12 (Namath & old Rogers) - 4=8 (new Rogers) - 4=4 (Favre) - 4 snaps= 0 football hope for Jets fans and Rogers now yelling Fore! as he transitions into golf full time. Maybe the curse is letting the quarterback wear a number divisible of 4?
I think Bills fans also thought that game was a horror movie as well
This is an incredible rant! Just laugh it off Rich or you'll cry yourself to sleep each night.
Did  NY Jets fans really expect to get to playoffs or Super Bowl this season just because Rodgers? I think with or without Rodgers they couldn't get to playoffs, not to mention the Super Bowl, that's a wild dream.
If I had to block it out, I'd say that it went like this: 0:38 - Denial (This can't be happening again?) 3:00 - Anger ("What the hell is he doing there?!?") 7:30 - Bargaining (It's not that bad, "We found out just how talented the roster is.") 11:10 - Depression ("But we're now staring into the abyss") 12:30 - Acceptance ("This feels like therapy.") 14:00 - Rapid recycle through all the stages, in no particular order, until Exhaustion
Rich clapping like a gangster you know he pissed
Rich is 100% correct. Any long time Jet fan knew this was going to happen.
Wah wah wah 😫
The kid that filled in looked good for the little while I watched. I'm a Lions fan, get over it.
How many Achilles, ACL, MCL, before the NFL bans turf! The players need to strike!!!!
Well there's only one God and there's only one 👑 King, and Leonard Floyd is a great football and Leonard Floyd is a great football player, he ended Rodgers career the Rams should have never traded that boy to Buffalo and I've been a die-hard Rams fan my whole life and ever since Leonard Floyd came onto the Rams team it changed and I almost cried when they let him go
If my Eagles can’t win this year, I’m pulling for the Jets. I really hope Zach Wilson becomes “the guy” this year.
I'm glad I'm not a Jets fan (from a Browns fan).
Prolly 1 of the best qbs to do it…but he prolly don’t even have it anymore. Hate to say it.
I’ve been doing my own research on Achilles tendon injuries and I think if he just takes ivermectin then he should be ready for next week
Where is Rogers backup Matt Flynn...
5 snaps, if you count his achilles tendon
I believe in the Baseball Gods, but not sure about football Gods.
No one whines more than Jets fans. The Cards are almost always bad, but their fans just take their medicine and hope for next year. So tired of New York assuming that the rest of the country cares if they’re happy.
Rogers has been broken before.  Broken collar bone, broken ankle, etc.  Imagine if Rogers leaves Cal and takes the starting job in NY as #8 and this happens....  We have no Packers history and none of the fireworks of the Packers era.
I'll give you another Rich..  Who wore the number 4, for the Green Bay Packers?
Jets need to pay him off and cut him.  Rodgers is nothing but trouble.
I really didn’t expect a Scatman Cruthers reference, but I’m here for it.
Yeah Tom ain't playing behind that line bro
I haven't heard anyone say this yet, but he should have just gone down! 39 year old man with a calf issue trying to escape a young 250lb+ tackler who already has you wrapped up. There was a reason Tom Brady crumbled as soon as any defensive players got in his face. In hind sight, go down old man!!
So so sorry rich.
No the Jets fans got five snaps. Four hiking the ball. And1 achilles' tendon.😮,❤️‍🔥
Matthew 5:3 Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Rich I really like your content and this show, and you seem like an awesome guy, but I cannot help but giggle at the emotionally expressed misfortune of Jets fan you have brought us.
This could be the 1999 Rams situation all over again when Trent Green went down and Kurt Warner came in and led them to a Superbowl victory over the Titans.....nah.....nevermind.
broo that shining reference wtf haha
😥
Love this story telling!
This season was over once they burned the cheesehead
Karma is great isn't it!! He takes all the money he can from the Packers so we couldn't sign better players but with the Packers for A Aron he only cared about money not winning!!!👋👋
It’s like George Lucas said.. it’s poetry.. it rhymes
If you blinked you missed Aaron Rodgers' Jets' career.
I'm a Niner but I feel with the Jets on this one. I think there is not a real football fan not feeling with the Jets and Rodgers. What a sick and heartbreaking reality. And if there is one headcoach in this league I'd have to pick other than Kyle Shanahan, it's Robert Saleh. No idea how he kept this thing together.
Feel for ya Rich. All that money and effort to start Zachy boy next week😢 Appreciate Elijah Moore though💪🏽
Rich  You need to get a Hindu priest and do Pooja to get rid of the Jets curse
I laughed when it happened because this is the most Jets thing to ever happen. But I honestly feel bad for them. What a story it would be if Aaron essentially coaches Zach Wilson the Jets make a serious run.
Not enough practicing.. used to have 4 pre seaon games, plus full pad practicing.
The Jets are eternally cursed thanks to Joe Namath. 😂
But they're still the JETS, REMEMBER!   LMAO!  YOULL ALWAYS BE THE JETS. HA HA GO PATRIOTS!
An offensive line is very important to protect QBs like Rodgers
Awesome Awesome Awesome.  That is the best segment I have watched over the past 2 years I've been catching your show. I also feel the pain of the long-suffering fan devoid of victories or trophies. Been there watching my own team in the AFL making the Grand Final ( our Super Bowl) , losing badly, then self destructing and finally winning the wooden spoon ( finishing last). I get it Rich, I truly do. But again that segment AWESOME!!!!!
Answer: A decent Offensive Line to block so their QB doesn't get in this situation...
Eisens Lamentations 😂😂😂
Are the Jets a baseball team from Japan? Never heard of them
Show Aaron Rodgers took five snaps in total😂😂😂😂
Your story was great but you could have mentioned the 50 yard FG hitting the post!   OK, I now heard you mention the hit goal post as another dagger in our heart.
Lmaooo. BEST RANT EVER. Call Tom Brady talk has me on the Floor...
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Man it’s tough to be a jets fan. I don’t know why I do it to myself. I even bought into the hype.
I am just wondering why no one picked up Floyd on the fourth play of the game.  He had a clear run to Aarons blindside.  I think this was a bullshit play.  I honestly think their is more going on here.  But, who cares right!
Still best Jet QB career ever??
maybe you should be less of a dismissive condescending douche to your co-hosts and you wouldn't have such bad karma.
Come on Rodgers was not even a top 10 quarterback last year …was never going to take Jets to a superbowl he only went to NY cause they had young talent. No disrespect to Arron but doesn’t have the legs or mobility to win a superbowl
I love “ANGRY” Rich Eisen😂
Mushrooms will do it every time.
Everyone says Aaron took a total of 4 snaps as a New York Jet but it's actually 5 if u count the Achilles snap. (PS: I know he tore it but just go with it alright)
I rather continue to lose then call Brady
I joked about it being funny if this happened cos of all hype but now that it's happened turns out it's not actually that funny. Rodgers' constant need to be smartest guy in any room makes it pretty hard to feel sorry for him on a personal level but man I feel sorry for Rich and the Jets fans.
Merciless Ming had a time machine and used it. Because in my reality Rodgers would have taken the Jets to the Super Bowl ( To face the army in Red and gold). Now where was that river in Greece again that made the warrior invincible? Or which Merlin can heal this heel? Just let him be back for the Playoffs!
I let my fantasy league draft just go this year and it gave me the jets defense... and joe burrow i had hope..
I've never seen a fan base get more excited to get a 40 year old player than this one.
I can feel his pain
Damn Rich turned the drama up to an 11 today lol
COULD HAVE HAD DEREK CARR!
From Achilles of Greece to Aaron Rodgers, that damn injury has been wreaking havoc on mankind since time immemorial lol
Rich and Greeny can’t take it 😅
From this Cleveland Browns fan having been through endless decades of misery beyond imagination, my heartfelt sympathies to JETS Nation. 🙏💔😔
Brees manning brady and now rodgers...end of an era
I wish that the world was fair. I wish I could see a Jets-Saints Super Bowl. I'd love to see a Lions-Browns match-up. Where's my Vikings-Bills Big Game? How about Cards-Chargers or Bears-Titans? Or Texans-Panthers or Jags-Panthers? What about Bengals-Eagles or Bengals-Seahawks? Poor Rich.
"Axe in the chest?" Please...  Your team won.🎉😅 Dipstick.😮
Youre a fool if you cant figure out it's staged entertainment now.
Rodgers is done. He wasn't that into doing this to begin with, but didn't want to look like he 'quit'. Now he has his out. He will not be missed.
Well, you'll always have memories of the Superbowl show of Broadway Joe! Could be worse, ask any of us Viking fans😢... and quit whining! 😂😂😅
The Jers O line needed work from the start of training camp .
Rich has the absolute best Podcast voice 💯
Love the Shining analogy, these young kids have no idea about it, though😂😂
You fools… Rodgers gets 100 million$ guaranteed  injury or no injury.!  Why are you all devastated.!
I just experienced a therapy session free of charge.   Thanks Rich.
Well I still think Canelo is going to win in late Sept.
call tom lol, then he breaks his leg in the first game..then what?
Epic. This public cry of anguish from Rich occupies the same rarefied air as any of Cactus Jack's pre-WWE promos (if you know, you know). Positively Shakepearean.
Rich, Howard Dean got kicked out of politics because he raised his voice like you do in this video. Please calm down. It’s a stupid game. ☮️
Repent of your sins and put your trust in Jesus Christ for hell awaits
Feel sorry for Rich but I'm happy for Wilson, hopefully pays off the teaching he got from AR.
Well, I guess the football gods are still extracting a toll for the biggest upset and most important ,league changing win in NFL history, man thats quite a price to pay though
Brady would have to divest his minority ownership of the Raiders to even try to comeback for a third time. Less than zero chance.
Zach Wilson should say karma to the Jets and tell them to find somebody else to play the rest of the season.
Don't wanna hear it  bro,  try being a Vikings fan..🤮🤷‍♂️
its time for an exorcism.
God i love rich eisen ❤
Jets fans are not allowed to have nice things.
Rich, love ya but your shirt's too big.
One of the best sports monologue I've heard in awhile.
Jinxed ! Well, they need to get Rid of MetLife!  They ripped me off on My Whole Life Policy ! Good Luck with That !
Rich, feeling for you and all jets fans. Horrible situation, lions fan, so I can emphasize. Great win against the Bills, good luck jets
The Vinny injury hurt as well as the Chad Pennington injury hurt.  I hope for the best for this team. Also, Zach's improvement because I haven't seen much (seeing the open receiver, telegraphing INT's, inaccurate passes, reading the defense, holding the ball in the pocket; more than 3 secs, throwing TD's) but Coach states alot he has improved. To be positive. I say my prayers for my favorite team...💚🕊️
Is there an Emmy or Pulitzer category for whatever this is? Rich Eisen is a national treasure.
Sad carear end
Football Gods are still upset about Super Bowl 3 and Namath promising a win.
Redrum
Of course disappointment was a given for Jets fans but really, you deserved hope for more than four snaps.
I was waiting for this one lol
You're going to sit there and say Saleh good? Listen to yourself. THAT IS WHY the Jets suck, because the fan base accepts it. The team is a business supplying a demand. The lower standards of the fam base the less incentive the team has to win.
You must carry madam zeroni up the mountain to Gods thumb and sing her a lullaby.
Rich you summed it up perfectly for us Jets fans. Football Gods: “What do you want?”
Unfortunately, rich, we told you when the trade went down. joe douglas better not be a fucking idiot, and put a decent line in front of him.  Guess what, joe douglas was a fucking idiot and spent all his time getting Rodgers' friends, instead of looking for ways to improve that shitty line. Saleh even said it during hard knocks, but by then it was too late.  Time for the jets to get a smarter GM. Somebody who can actually draft well in the later rounds and put together a decent line. Douglas' can't draft outside of the top 10. Any time after those top picks, he's trash.
Jets will always be one time champs
They better tank for Caleb Williams
Cam Newton is ready
Wha - Wha - Wha !
Eisen. Dont forget. Bret Farve had the Jets rolling then Boom. Injured ans faded away
Rich I feel your pain. I was a Washington fan for the longest time even though the Panthers would be considered my "home" team. I never liked Dan Snyder. I thought he brought to much garbage to the game. It was good he brought Joe Gibbs back. So if the Washington Team can have a metamorphous so can the Jets.
So that happens to Vinny in 99' then 20 years later the almost exact same thing happens to Rodgers. And people are still saying the NFL ain't scripted lmao
All Zach needs is 16 points a game and the Jets will win streak, it will be fine
nick foles could either take them to the Superbowl or get benched but I think those are good odds. Sign Nick Foles because he's successful with the right coach
Call Tom Brady! Great example of why he's one of the few commentators worth watching!
Aaron Rodgers blew out his Achilles. That could be the end of his career. At his age it could be done for him. Sad to see this happen to the Jets. I'm a Steelers fan. My Steelers had a terrible week. I didn't expect much from the Aaron Rodgers led Jets even though the Jets last year looked like a team coming around. But with Buffalo and Miami in the division I didn't think they had enough yet for them two. New England I thought would be bottom but now who knows. But they pulled off a win against Buffalo so.
I wrote it a million years ago and I reiterate. Mr rich eisen I Love u
so true rich. unreal all they hype all the big contract and the big debut. rodgers is out for the season. a joke.
I think what the "football gods" want is an offensive line Rich.
Technically it was 5 snaps. 4 plays and 1 tendon. 😏
Rich is the man.
Whatever, it's hilarious that after all that hype about Aaron Rodgers, the Jets had him for approximately 4 minutes and then boom, right back to the same old Zach Wilson led Jets.
As terrible as all this is, this take was just brilliant ❤
9 12 1999
Oh I feel your pain...I'm a life long Browns fan. The Kosar v Elway battle was bad for our psyche in Cleveland. Then the theft of the Browns by Baltimore. Then 20+ years of insane mismanagement! So yes, we in Cleveland know your pain. Oh, and remember that double over time game in Cleveland v Jets. Yes, you guys need psychiatric care.
Arron Rodgers can still help coach Wilson. I think he can help him improve a ton.
4 plays….it’s all so strange….. twin towers fell…right tackle then left
Im waiting for this episode. Sorry rich
This is the most emotional I’ve ever seen rich.
Zack looked absolutely terrified
When’s the next senate hearing on uaps, ufos?
Learn how to take a sack
Epic Rant Rich! I feel for you dude! 😁
History repeats for the Jets QB curse LOL
Rich's analogy with The Shining is so accurate and hilarious.
the bambino. boohoo
No sympathy for Jets fans, only sympathy for Rodgers himself.  Damn shame to see great player end a season (or career) so quickly in such a manner.  😢
Conspiracy Theory #1.  Aaron looked old, tired, and scared.  Those kids were knocking some heads, kicking some butt, slapping people around. Rodgers wanted none of that.  He took a dive.  And I damned sure don’t blame him.
As a Bucs fan, I feel so fortunate Brady didn't blow his Achilles in his first game
He compared last night to the Shining 😂 🪓
Call up Fitzmagic again 😂
Being a Jets fan is miserable. Many have come and gone without joy in their lives.
Niners will take a 1st round pick for a guy that’s a generational thrower of the ball.. a guy who carry’s himself like a franchise QB, a guy who’s 6’3, 225 LB’s, has great athleticism, has a jaw line and smile of gold… what do you say rich/ New York? Let us know what you are done with MILFhunter69.
You should really consider thanking Joe Namath for guaranteeing that Superbowl, all those years ago. Thats ehat really has done the Jets in ever since. Cant go around giving guarantees like that for superbowl games. Definitely not by doing it and then actually winning the game. Football gods are never going to stop being mad about that, until Joe Namath apologizes to them individually.
Shut up. You should have never had that aged declining QB. And why did you have this aged declining QB? Because Jets fans are losers. You like the Jets to suck because you're from New Jersey and you love to complain and whine. You love complaining and whining way, way more than winning.
Weirdly though, this is probably better (for Rich) than seeing 2022's Aaron Rodgers struggle all year, and the Jets miss out that way. I mean, be realistic, behind that offensive line, Rodgers was gonna have a bad time, as were the Jets. At least this way Rich can continue to take the high road, the whole "what could have been" etc etc, if the "Football Gods" had been better to us, etc etc. Its funny how really terribly ran organisations seem to blame those old "Football Gods" every time, isn't it 🤷
Gematria entered the chat
Its officially overreaction teusday. And tomorrow will be overreact wednesday. Along with every day after that until next season begins.
I love Chad Pennington
No offense to my cowboys but I fully expect us to lose next week cause that’s our MO we lose games we should win.
Talk about being a victim! Football is like dating. I don’t care how hot the chick is you never date the ex of a friend. If you do your no friend of ours. Go Pack Go lol jk to soon?
I still have hope this is a GOOD team. If rodgers can get his head right and say screw it. “I’m going to sit on the sideline and coach the hell out of this kid”. This would be the start of Aaron’s coaching career.
Maybe the jets could sign Joe Namath to a 10 day contract, and let HIM be a honorary Captain.  Joe would then be allowed to retire as a Jet.  The Football Gods would be appeased, and the Jets could win.
All the Sports Curses that we know of. And I'd like to know, what Sports Gods did Jets Fans piss off? Or was it a previous Owner etc? Cuz WOW. If the Jets didn't have Bad Luck, they wouldn't have any.
As a Jets fan I'm gutted, good luck to Zach Wilson though, hopefully he and the rest of the team can get us to the playoffs.
Yep prime example of history repeating itself. You know what they say if you keep doing the same thing keep getting the same results🤷🏻‍♀️
Maybe lil Nicky has it right
If Rodgers was a REAL ONE, he would be coaching Zack from the recliner all off season.
Hackett did not help Zach with the play calling. and that O-line had him running for his life all night
Not like this.......not like this...... ..........
14:56 if you count his achilles, he actually played 5 snaps
Man…this is all just super crazy. Honestly I am super surprised at all thats happened. I unfortunately was at work when Aaron got injured… But just hearing about the aftermath was kind of wind blowing to me because I watched a few different episodes of hard knocks and kind of watched stuff that he’s been doing with the Jets and I felt like it was going to be a great year for him…and now it’s just completely gone. And again mind you… I’m a Packers fan, so I’m only watching Aaron on the outside because I’ve enjoyed watching him over the last five years that I actually started watching football…but it’s just crazy to see everything that’s happened in the last 24 hours.
As a 45+ years Oilers-Titans fan, I feel your pain Rich.
The Phoenix Suns and NY Jets can never have anything nice. Cursed franchises. 🤦🏻‍♂️
I cried like at the "Tuck Rule Game"... I can imagine what Jets fans are going through
As a 30 year fan of the Washington [redacted] I feel the pain Rich and every single Jets fan is going through today
People forget that the Jets still won. I don't think that Rodgers would have made that much of a difference. He's an old man on a bad team. (Laughing all the way to the bank.)
Turf is TRASH!
Imagine what Rich said off air while watching that game live..😂
Aaron is a freakin Warrior, with todays new technology for this surgery he can be ready for 2024.  Can Akers did it as a RB . Go A Rod... age is only a # !
It makes you wonder if he’s regretting not retiring. This whole coming out of the darkness retreat and wanting to play for the Jets… Maybe it was bad juju. I feel bad for him. I’ve always loved Aaron Rodgers, but maybe this is a sign to call it quits. He can be successful without playing football. He’s a smart guy. Maybe now is the time to really truly evaluate it all.
The patriot act
Remember when the patriots won after 9/11
Scripted
JETS FANS YOU SHOULD TRY TO GET TREY LANCE. COWBOYS GAVE UP 4TH ROUNDER MAYBE YOU CAN OFFER THEM A 3RD OR 2ND ROUNDER TO GET HIM FROM THE COWBOYS
Rich Eisen made me believe in the Jets this year. His passion for them is how I am for my Eagles. Yet, he’s better at that talking thing. This was a deep dive into the pain of loving a football team. The fire, burns bright and hot. Whether you’re flying high or having those hard knocks. This segment should be nominated for awards.
Rich Great Show I Can Relate I'm A Raiders Fan I Really  Feel For Your Loss Bud
Aayyy MEN Brother!?!?!
GRASS, GRASS, GRASS GET RID OF TURF!!!!!! WHAT A SHAME CHEAP OWNERS.
Karma for lying about taking the vaccine 😂
Pure tragedy 😢
Casting getting penalty..end for me
Five snaps actually 😢
This segment is longer than Rodgers was on the field, I for one am  rejoicing that I don’t have to hear Joe Buck, gush all over this guy anymore……..
Dude… try being a Detroit Lions fan… this is the first time ever that we have hope
Move back to New York City - The  Meadowlands is cursed
I am really starting to think New York sports are cursed. Since the Giants won the Super Bowl, the KC Royals have played in as many title game/series as New York teams. (I don't count MLS) And the Royals beat the Mets. In fact both the Rangers and Mets lost in 5 games.
Simply the Jets are under a curse.
# 2 THE BYU BLONDE BOMBER GETS A SECOND CHANCE.  ALL THE WAY FROM PROVO UTAH.
Damn You Namath Curse Strikes Again!!!! Maybe They can Appease the Football Gods by stop fraudulently calling themselves NY when Everyone knows they Play in Jersey!
# 14 RICHARD TOAD ,  #17 MATT ROBINSON.
Long time Bills fan. Man, I got sick for Jets fans when Rodgers went down (not to mention Rodgers). Unfrickinbelievable.
Jets really are cursed 😃 All of it is truly well-deserved.
Yea, i feel exactly the same way Rich, its devastating, im devastated, we go through so much and i cant even comprehend it anymore, it makes no sense its exhausting, im tired.
Karma…?
Kobe(24) shot free throws after his
As a Dolphins Fan i feel Rich Pain.
I feel bad for ya Rich
Bro, brady aint answering that call, have you seen that offensive line thst just got rodgers killed?? Lmfao and brady HATES the jets. Also even on the off chance he wojld entertain that call,. hes now a part ownerr. It wouldnt be allowed they would never allow it.. keep crying. Youre stuck with wilson. Lmfao
This is the funniest segment Rich has ever done.
I feel bad for Aaron and the Jets.
2017. My beloved Philadelphia Eagles were 11-1. Throttling the LA  Rams in a huge December match up. The MVP. Carson Wentz goes down. Torn ACL. Out. Nick Foles comes in. And. Takes Philadelphia to its biggest day since 7/4/1776. Is Zach that guy. Don't think so. But. Eagle fans have been in those dark places. Buddy Ryan, Randall's ACL, Jerome Brown, Ritchie K, 3 straight NFC Game losses, McNabb pukes in SB 39. McNabb. I will argue untill Nick Foles Philadelphia had far more dark times. But. Monday Night. Jet Fan. Went to another level. Rich. I feel you. Sometimes the Football Gods send you. Nick Foles.
I mean, he’s 39. It’s only surprising it happened in the first game. He was never making it a full season.
Omg I laughed so hard when he said “what the hell is he doing there” 😂😂 I’m sorry for your pain Rich
Kinda like testing out a old expensive car that the oil leaks and no else wanted.  Jets did get there 1st round draft pick back so let's stop over reacting to a warn down QB
Oh my stars, Rich et al, it is really so simple, your O line is terrible. Rogers lasts four snaps and Wilson has been running for his life for two years. And you think Tom Brady should consider this an opportunity after what just happened to Arron? There is no curse, but that is magical thinking.
Clearly everybody was waitin on this one! Love yu RichEisen
Here's the thing... knocking on 40 Rodgers CANNOT/COULD NOT have expected to continue to play the way he has over the years. The DEs and DTs today are both faster and stronger than they were 10 years ago. There’s a reason Brady played as long as he did, he avoided hits as much as possible.
Remember that time you swooned our quarterback away and he made it four plays? That was AWESOME
Leonard Floyd is the 2nd most hated man with the last name "Floyd" The Most hated one dead.
Respect, man, from a Red Sox and Patriots fan.
This is gay.  Stopped watching midway.
Jet rebuilding since SB3
This was such a Jets moment. Someone somewhere cursed the Jets. I never wish any player hurt.
I could play, What do you want from us on a loop all day, sorry Rich. But this was great😂
I haven't read all the messages,  and I know that it would be a difficult contract negotiation, but wouldn't Fitzmagic be perfect for the Jets?
Coming from a Pats fan, really sucks what happened to Aaron. Even I was curious what he could do for the Jets. But they can't go on with Wilson. Tried and failed last year with him. Gotta get a guy who can play like Matt Ryan, Carson Wentz, Cam Newton, or Joe Flacco. Plug in one of these guys and they might get a wild card.
My heart goes out to Rich in this time of deep loss and grief. As a Raiders fan, I’m familiar with hope. Hopeless hope.
Grass fields. It’s not complicated.
This is objectively the funniest segment Rich has ever done. I feel for him so much, but I couldn't help but laugh at just how absurd the whole situation is and how over it Rich is.
Josh Allen had a mark sanchez moment lol
Maybe they will trade for Sam again lol
You know you know Brady probably could do it
Winning the game is just another way for the football gods to throw more salt in the Jets wounds, it's just another example of false hope, another tease, because somewhere there are Jets fans believing that they have a chance with Wilson.
Aaron Rodgers being injured and out for the season, on the first drive of the year, is the Jetsiest thing that could have happened.  I sympathize with your pain, Rich.
Goddamn I missed Rich Eisen so much!
Not sure what the big deal is. Horror Movie blah blah blah. Don't most teams have 2-3 QBs around to replace injured ones? Doesn't the NFL pick the best of the best college athletes? Jets will be fine and win 1/2 the games the play.
The most animated I have ever seen Rich.
When the dust settles on this one, can the conversation turn to the hopeless state of the O line that left the gates wide open
I went in to this weekend thinking all four AFC East teams had a good shot at making the playoffs.    I still feel good about Miami….
For me to begin to help you, you have to get a grass field. Do that and good fortune will begin to reveal itself.
Butt Fumble.
We can rebuild him. We have the technology.
9/11/23 was the 24 year anniversary 1999 QB Vinny Testeverde tearing his Achilles on opening day..jets won that game too
I thought Rich was gonna tear down the whole set at one point lol
Poor Rich 😢
A tragedy like no other. Horrible 😢absolutely awful 😞
I remember that happening to Vinny T 😢 even as a Dolphins fan & not being a Jets fan at all - this was sad for Aaron R & Jets fans.
WHAT DOES THE FOOTBALL GODS WANT IT'S NOT THE FOOTBALL GODS... IT'S THE DEVIL AND HE WANTS JOE WILLIEs SOUL!!!
Always room in Philadelphia for another eagles fan. We love rich
I feel bad for Aaron. I do not feel bad for Yet fans. The worse fan base in the history of the NFL IMO. F the Yets.
The scariest horror stories are real.
This was the greatest ! The pain in Rich's voice is so real .
An all time, hall of fame rant
Something occurred to me before the game last night.  One was that Rodgers was never going to last the entire season without injury.  Why?  Because (a) his name isn't Brady and (b) he is playing for the J-E-T-S.
It's crazy that the skull was 22:16 when it was 22 years ago that 9/11 hit us also this freaking thing with the Achilles heel again maybe we just could have got to put our faith into this kid and hopefully Zach could pull it at pull it out I'm 65 I only sold one Super Bowl
Paying a QB 37.5 mil behind that offensive line.
"Call Tom Brady"   🤣  i can just picture that phone call.   "Hey Tom,  wanna unretire and come play for the Jets?"   Tom:  *gives no answer and just hangs up*
Damn feel bad for the jets though luck
all that  .... and the Jets already blew the #1 overall pick to the Arizona Cardinals (0-17)
LOL. Testeverde honorary captain??  Those fate tempting idiots!
Well. The jets are cursed more than the giants. And that's  hard to do.
As a 30 year Jets fan I resign from Jets fanhood. I can't take it anymore. I wish them well
As a Browns fan I am sorry for your loss .
Jets went all in on a new QB and have the worst field in the league. Ya’ll need to get grass
I’ve gotta feeling Jets gonna do alright this season, maybe a smidge better than alright despite the Matrix trolling Jets fans.
There's definitely something sinester about all of this... specially when you see Vinny Testaverde wearing his old jersey with the number 16,  and guess what were the scores for both teams going into over time?  16-16.... if that's not creapy I don't know what is :)
You got there because the organization can't draft a QB and you thought a 40-year-old was going to be your savior.
Eisen, your the best, that was great
simulation is real. Basilisk was not pleased.
Sorry Rich, wish Rodgers and the Jets well.
Wow Rich very strange coincidence. As a Bears fan knowing an ex Bear took out Aaron seems a bit strange too. I feel for you. I remember the Rex Grossman injuries and how i felt back then.
Sorry Rich, Tom isn’t gonna play behind that line 😂
Jets are cursed. All the Jet fans that I saw in Canton for the Hall Of Fame, I said keep your fingers crossed. They all agreed with me but it did not work.
Because of turnovers
I’m so fucking depressed
They had to run draws-they couldn’t trust Josh not to throw it to the jets again
This is why we cant have nice things
It absolutely is the turf. It rips apart knees, ankles, and Achilles tendons. Gotta switch back to grass!
The real gut punch to the Jets organization is the fact that they have to pay Aaron Rodgers 37.5 million a year to not play.
I heard Rogers has a $75M guaranteed contract. The Jets paid $18.75M per snap.
Football gods want a natural feild it would seem
Scat man kruthers
9/12/1999 never forget
Vinny the Guinne
Zack did say all the right things I can’t lie.
Rich forgot when they had a promising quarterback in Pennington and he got hurt and had shortened career
This is the most Jets things that has ever jetted
Even though the Jets beat the Bills in OT - which was great, it didn't feel like a joyous victory because of A-Rod popping his Achilles tendon on the fourth play of the game and being cheated out of an opportunity to see what could've been. Now the Jets are going to have to take what's given to them and ride it out by sticking to the plan with as A-Rod as QB coach for Wilson and play the rest of the season with brutal vengeance and retaliatory instincts upon the rest of the opponents after what was done to A-Rod.
Actually, Rich, it was five snaps!?! What, too soon?!
Just such a strange play to me. He’s the king of throwing the ball away and tried to get away just live to see another down. Easy to say that now but still he didn’t do what he normally would do in that situation.
Rich, I am a Packer fan.   Gutenkunst did Aaron wrong.  But that's beside the point.  I was pulling very hard, for Aaron to complete "The Brady"....  Go to another team, and win the Super Bowl.  So yeah, this is devastating.    But, if I may Sir, the LESSON here, the LESSON, is to GET A GREAT OFFENSIVE LINE IN PLACE BEFORE YOU SIGN THE QB OF YOUR DREAMS!!!!!  Ahem....  Sorry.  Didn't mean to be shouting there.....  Pardon me, I apologize....    Joe Burrow was getting DESTROYED yesterday....  What are they doing???  How many more Andrew Lucks will it take, before teams start taking their O-Line seriously??????  How many more???  And besides the players, this goes to coaching as well....  If your O-Line is being beaten like a drum, bring in some backup O-Linemen at tight end slots... Bring in backs...  Do what you have to do, to GET IT BLOCKED......    Brady in his prime, Montana in his prime, Marino in his prime, could NOT get it done with .5 seconds to throw....  It's absurd.  Figure it out, coaches.....    Look, I'm the last guy in the world to defend Zach Wilson, but, on the play Rich referenced, he had NO time...  The snap was almost intercepted.....  So, what's he supposed to do???  It's a miracle he got the ball off for an incompletion....  That was actually a great job.....  Just saying, Coaches, O-Line, scouts, front office, all have to share in this debacle......  Just saying, you can't give a toddler an antique Ming Dynasty Vase to play with, and "hope everything will be okay"....   If you're gonna have that Vase in your house, you have to take steps to protect it.....
Aron Rodgers got hurt… surprised…. Really. He wasn’t all that last year…. ESPN on there projecting by a small degree for the Bills to win. That kid came out and didn’t F up…..and Jets won…Aron Rodgers won his one Super Bowl years ago.  The only thing that shocked me was that instead of hearing Jets fan feeling grateful to this kid who helped them to victory is your all crying the Seasons over because you were dumb enough to believe AR was not going to get hurt sometime this season
The turf...the turf.
it's a horror movie to him, cause that's all he is capable of talking about..... get off the dude !!!!!!!!
There is always next week.
i was soooo ready for this rant
Neil O'Donnell all over again! Don't tell B about patience.
There are teams that will never be smiled at by the football gods
That shining analogy is legendary
Jets fans are so obnoxious. Get over it loser and move on.
🤣🤣🤣 let it out Rich, let it out.
Just like Rich, as a long time suffering Jets fan, I have refused to watch since the rumors of getting Rodgers here began. They have an idiot of a coach who drafted an idiot of a QB a year ago (yes, it was him who convinced Douglas to draft him) and deserves all of this. I didn't even care to watch this game. When my wife brought the injury up to me and I saw a short video of it with no ankle turning, I knew it was a torn achilles. The Jets deserve all of this. That coach deserves this.   Unfortunately, a good GM might go as well for allowing this to happen. You had an excellent backup QB that can be a starter with a real OL protecting him, which could have been done using those high draft picks they gave up for a 40 year old guy (which, by the way, you passed over the year he came out -- the Jets had the 23rd pick and Rodgers was drafted with the next pick). You can't see that, you both will likely go.  By the way, I go back to the days when as a teenager I remember the drafting of Donald Dykes over a national champion, Heisman winning QB from a little school called Notre Dame by the name of Joe Montana. In the 3th round no less. It was hard enough passing him over twice, (and by the way, their 1st 2 picks I loved) but a 3rd time? To select a no name DB? And don't get me started about passing over Dan Marino for a no name, Division II QB and the long plethora of other disastrous, idiotic picks.
Zack Wilson……..wonder how good he will be by the time he turns 18?
I'm so happy for Rich Eisen. I hope the same thing happens to Michigan. Feel sorry for Rodgers ($75 million guaranteed money) poor guy, but Jets suck😂😂😂😂😂
🧀🗣️🦵😂✈️💥
Anyone got Flacco's number?
My sympathy as a lions fan and fan of good football
Now they can be in the Caleb sweepstakes
I felt bad for their fans then I remembered my interactions by Jet fans 😂
As a Packer fan, I was excited to see the old man I adored all these years bring joy to a team in need of it. This was sad on so many levels and I wish it didn't happen. Hope he makes a recovery and plays another season or two. Unfortunately,  I don't know how possible that is.
I can't believe Favre is the superior Jets QB
This may be the best clip ever out of this show😂
Been waiting for this all day 😂😂
Jets fans… we suck so unlucky.   Lions fans… hold my beer while I tell you about us having not one, but two once in a generation talents and not doing crap with it.
Maybe Boomer should have been the captain?
I’m sorry Rich, we’re not allowed happiness and we are cursed. This might be my final blow as a fan. I just can’t take the constant times being beat down. I mean we’re never allowed happiness so why do I do this to myself. It sucks having a Super Bowl roster wasted yet again
Rich, Thanks for the Green Acres/Mr Haney relationship work shop. Go Steelers!
The football gods have again taken away a Mahomes/Rodgers duel.
3:05 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
A wise woman once said: “Hope is Faith’s Richer, Bitchier, Cousin.”
Watching him and greeny act smug and over the top, and now crashing down to earth it, great.
Welcome to being a Bengals fan brother!
Someone say it:  Karma.  He was a selfish me-first cancer to the Packer organization.  He tried to off the GM and undermined his coach.  You got what you deserved thinking you stole a fading 39 yr-old diva.
As a fins fan, i enjoy the hell out of jet misery. However I was looking forward to watching Tua slap them around w/ Roger's at Qb.
I feel ya Rich. 45 years Browns fan here with the same hope you unfortunately lost last night. It's our turn next don't worry....
Maybe the Jets and Giants should fix their crap field!
Feel so bad as NFL Fan, this is too brutal for everyone
Football gods are cruel. Take your qb but let’s you have the win as a consolation prize. Sons of bitches
I've never seen Rich so unhinged
They have to figure out with Zach.  There is no cap space for another top QB. Not only this year but next year as well. You cannot  pay a guy 75 million  to not play and have money  to pay  another one. His dead money is 66 million next year. You can not overcome that. They are going to have to keep him on IR until 2025. You only shot is Zach, get behind  him.
I just wanted to cry.. "its like therapy"
3:15 "WHAT THE HELL IS HE DOING THERE???"😯😯 LMDAO😂😂😂😂
I stayed up all day for this
Anyone who thinks that injury was legit, needs to have their eyes/head examined.
Get out of New York
seriously tragic
He said therapy like the diceman.
We definitely live in a simulation
Thoughts and prayers.😮
The Jets are cursed.. They are the new age Red sox
Bad kharma finally caught up to Arron Rodgers.
Jets fans can't have nice things...period
Get QUARTERBACK MARCUS MARIOTA From Philadelphia!
It’s really breaks my heart😔praying for Aaron for his fast recovery🙏❤️
Its a damn shame all of you aren't smart enough to know the National Felon League is scripted
Sorry Rich I know you were looking forward to this season
Sean McDermott is to the Buffalo Bills what Tony Dungy was to the Buccaneers; he’s good enough to get them to big games, but not good enough to get them to the Super Bowl.
....😂😂😂
Who needs Aaron Rodgers?
Heeeere's Zach!!
regretted didn't live betting Jets ML when it's 13-3, did bet pregame Jets ML.
Time to change the name to new jersey Jets.
I’ve seen the words ‘absurd’ and ‘ridiculous’ in the comments here, and that is exactly what this feels like! If y’all were like me and watched Hard Knocks this season, you felt excited for the season to start and that the jets might FINALLY win another Super Bowl or at least go deep into the playoffs. As soon as I heard the term ‘Achilles’, I got choked up hoping that it was just a high ankle sprain. Once I saw the story, I actually cried REAL TEARS!!! I just couldn’t believe it. This is EXACTLY what is meant by when you have such expectations for something or someone to save the day, then this happens and the disappointment is greater then you could ever imagine. I thought seeing my team lay an ACTUAL GOOSE EGG in the game the day before was bad enough…..then knowing what Monday’s date was and dreading it for obvious reasons, anticipating the game and hoping the jets would win…..the highs and lows and highs again of that game was quite literally an emotional roller coaster. I know in the grand scheme of everyday life for non-athletes, this doesn’t register as high, but for those of us who are avid sports fans waiting to see what A-Rod was going to do this season, I’m sick about this. I sincerely hope the Jets can use this as good fuel and positive motivation and win the Super Bowl. Y’all will have to peel me off the rug if that happens.
Vikings fans will be annoyed if Jordan Love gives Packer fans another 15 years of QB dominance.  That would suck.
Rich. Bro. It’s over.  You’re delusional. You won a week one game. I can get a pick off Zach Wilson
Shortchanged
This is what happens when you forget to sign/draft an O-LINE! I bet the Jets finish with a worse record than the Giants this year despite the latter getting destroyed by their biggest rival (yes, bigger than traditional sport rivals, Philadelphia and Washington).
His greatest rant...EVER...😅😅😅😅
Such a Jets thing to happen 😂
My brother was a huge Jets fan and he passed away in April. I really was sad because he wouldn't get to see Aaron play and I know he would've been excited. I can just hear him now saying, "I knew it!" Needless to say it's been a rough year. 😞
One of the best fan rants of all time! lol
Testaverde = Green Balls?
It was tough seeing Aaron get hurt
Rodgers never returns. He retires to a weed farm in California.
Awe man I felt bad for Mike Greene but didn’t think about Rich. Sorry Buddy. Hey, Michigan is good this year though
As a jets fan, i agree with everything he said, i love the defense,  i love breece, and i believe in zach, but after all of this... it's... just no words, just completely heartbroken 💔
As a nation we are all praying for Rich and Greeny. 🙏
Yall thought you were gonna get Brady?😂 final analysis Jets fans suffer more than Bucs fans! Welcome to the club! We got jackets and everything!
After the 4th snap of the game last night, I have been waiting for this rant eagerly.
You tell it like no other.
Let's go Lions
22Yrs later to the day the unfortunate people of New York witness another Jet crash.
Richard Todd
Rich I don't know who they are, but there are teams who have never won a Super Bowl. As a Colts fan I can somewhat feel your pain. I too was excited to watch the game, A, A,RON never acted like he was in any pain, so I thought he was coming back. Maybe this is the sacrifice needed to get over the hump, and back to the super bowl.
Homer Jones!!!!
And then the Jets tripped the defense on the punt return and the NFL pushed the darlings into a victory...  But you won't talk about that...
As soon as I heard Rodgers went down for the season I knew this was going to be epic. Poor Rich!
As a Lifelong Browns fan Im even sorry for you Rich
Giants fans will happily match whatever offer the Jets fans have for the football gods just to keep the Jets from having any real success.
Maybe y'all can get Tom Brady?
To be fair as a Bengals fan I know exactly how you feel, I mean we got like 7 games but still 😢
Serves him right, grass is never greener on the other side.  In GB he had an o-line in NY he did not.  The o-line in NY never played 1 preseason game together.  What do you expect.  He took GB for north of 500mil good riddance.  Good luck should of swallowed his enormous "pride" and stayed with an actual good team.
A Joe Theismann moment... a play that ends a playing career
There's a 0% chance you fit in that Jets jersey from 1999.  Wasn't the turf's fault it was the Jet's offensive line's fault. As a Giants fan, it would be the icing on the cake if Rodgers retires due to his Achilles injury.
As a Packers fan I always thought the  pack was cursed with NFC championships but this takes the cake and I’m so sad for Arod and Jets fans. I hope he comes back next season and jets get dbak and hopefully an actually oline. I’m not even a jets fan and I could see how robbed we all were for the potential the team had with arod
If they make the playoffs he is coach of the decade.
This is not happening
Rich sounds like he's been up all night drinking his sorrows away
Aaron could probably just take a little ivermectin cure that ankle right up .😊
I'm not even a Jets fan and feel bad.  Can't imagine how they feel.  Condolences.
Aaron Rogers just showed the whole NFL world that, as great a quarterback as he is, he’s OLD!!!! HOLY WOW!!!! That wasn’t even hard contact and he twisted an ankle. How fitting to have a lays potato chip commercial during the game, about “UN-retiring LMAO My condolences Jets fans, but the front office spent a pile of money on gambling on a QB in his 19th year in the league, and the 2nd OLDEST player in the league
To answer Rich’s question, “What do we do?” Not sure, but I know what you don’t do. Constantly telling Zach how bad he is won’t get you there.
Was waiting for this after what happened yesterday. Gotta love them Football Gods! 😂
Rich ur looking like a Pokémon character with ur hand gestures
He’s not even hurt.  This is all a hallucination.
I couldn't believe it either but the way rogers went down, body language, him on the cart and team personnel acting frantic, ruled out quicky; I knew it was probably an Achilles.  Other than thinking of Rich the next thing I thought of is, what can the Jets really do? It's too late to do much of anything. Even if they were to swing for a trade, they probably are including Wilson to give him a fresh start.   The Rams way of building a team isn't sustainable and going all in like this is risky, which the Jets basically did. Rams kinda got lucky and won it all but it's rare that works out. Jets, not so much I'm afraid.
You deserve it ichigan fan.  But big time blow to the fans of the nfl as a whole.
The football gods are cruel af.
4 snaps, that has to be a new record.
Thanks for the first mention of "nards" that I've heard since 1967.
Defense can only take you so far in today's NFL
I feel for jets fans. That said get some reliable fat tackles
I feel bad for Aaron and the fan base. I hope your team has a better season than expected.
I remember when the Browns signed LeCharles Bentley and he blew out his knee in training camp.  Never played a snap for us and had to retire.  Was a gut punch I still remember.
I absolutely love Rich Eisen and his passion for everything. My heart breaks for his Jets.
Lol
We all knew it.   But the media lied for 12 hours saying it was an ankle and naming every other tendoned down there.  Why were they lying?  What was their benefit?
Omg Rich with the Shining reference is beyond perfect hahahahahahahaha
This is less about the Jets and more about the fact that Rodgers was never meant to leave a Green Bay.
I don’t know what to do. What do I have to give. Why did any hope even enter my mind in April. I tried not to feel joy when Rogers signed and the way he took command of this team.  All the small chips falling into place. I tried……and was rewarded with 4 plays….that’s it. When will this nightmare finally subside. When…
No good luck follows after a NFL team appears on Hard Knocks.  The show is a curse.
Jets suck and will always suck
I'm still completely under shock. It hurts. It's a great depression for me as a diehard, I just don't have any words for this. It hurts..
The first 4 snaps were ok - it was the 5th snap that was the problem.  Too soon?
Damn imagine all the hype and all the bad a surrey and all that other bullshit the Jersey buying just and only see him play 4 times lol
Everyone I know who watches football knew this would happen.  Intentionally or accidentally we called it.  Aaron will not want to tarnish his legacy with new York.  HE wants to survive 2 years in the NFL so he doesn't go into the hall of fame the same year as Tom brady.  Duh..adam Schefter is gonna get a bonus from the nfl for alluding g to the phantom Achilles injury from negative x-rays
we just need a brad Johnson or a Trent Dilfer type quarterback
Why not have all that get Tom energy go to your back up who helped win you that game last night.....
This is why they should have never got him and instead aggressively pursued Lamar Jackson.  Rodgers is done.  Theres no next year.
Kapernek ?
If you listen to what Dan Marino said about when he came back from a complete Achilles tear…he couldn’t lift his left foot off his heel and onto his toe anymore.  He was younger than Aaron Rogers…this is end of Aaron as we knew him unfortunately.
Tails never fails? Maybe not at the coin toss, but certainly was the outcome at the end. Tails NEVER fails my friend! Bears fan here rooting for you son!
The nfl will controll the season  like they done the last 30yrs...and you will get the two teams they decided to give you for your superbowl.....nfl is not sport it's entertainment...the whole league is controlled  everyweek...
The problem is the football gods are getting what they want, your perpetual suffering and absolute uncertainty. Or maybe the want you to have a grass field who knows
All Jets quarterbacks must continue to live in Flash Gordon's shadow.
4 snaps, #8, #16, 24th year…👀
We need Brady now sos
Brockman called it last week, the Jets are the Jets.
He should have worn number 12. Namath gave him permission. Now it looks like Brady can wear it. LOL!
Rodgers just ain't got it no more. My man ran off with the LOOT! (or limped off)
This is a master class on how to rant about something.
The football gods want your pain, Rich Eisen. And they will not be denied.
As a lifelong jets fan, Rich, we are cursed. That’s it man😔. True pain.
Reminds me of Gordon Hayward breaking his leg 2 min into Celtics season
JETS = Chargers of the AFC East
Rich we will keep fighting the Jets war brother,lets Go!!
*Its like The Rachel Maddow Show...lol*
Boo hoo karen rodgers😂
nobody realistically cares outside of the Jets fans and organization
Bears fans feel ya.
Packers Gods saw Roger's in a Jets uniform and said Nope.
Rich….. Listen, if there is any one that UNDERSTANDS, it is a Lions fan. I still have PTDS. When I saw Rodgers injury my Lions life flash by my eyes. Hang in there…..you have ZW.
Hey get over it, I've been a lifelong Bengal fan, remember trading up to the 1st pick to get Kijana Carter and on the first or second play in pre-season blew out his knee. Never ever recovered, I feel your pain, but I could add to the long list of the football gods crapping on the Bengals. Who Dey
I might have to be a jets fan. This so too harsh
Epic!!! being a raiders fan i feel everything Rich is going through
Kinda sounds like being a Jets fan isn't much different than being a Oakland/LA/back to Oakland/to Las Vegas Raiders fan💯😆I start off every season in the acceptance stage of grief, makes life easier on me. I don't have to go through the other stages of grief first, go right to acceptance good sir.
Had a dream the jets won the Super Bowl b4 the season started, feels like the perfect start
Once Zach Wilson turns 16 you won't miss old man Rodgers anymore
As a Dolphins fan, I understand the Jets fan situation. We had Marino for many years and only made it to one Super Bowl. We've usually had better teams than than the Jets the past few decades, but were never serious Super Bowl Contenders either.
Pray for Minshew Rich...The only way to salvage the season.
Sounds like Cowboys fans too. It’s ok. We won’t make the SB either
Joe Namath coming out of retirement. Say's he's ready to take over the QB position for the J=E=T=S.
Jets should have gone all in for Lamar Jackson
Boy ...  those football gods really have a warped sense of humor, don't they?
Jets are snake bitten. They have bad mojo.
I think it's pretty clear at this point that the football gods demand grass, and the eradication of turf fields everywhere.
All right, I'm only 17 seconds in, but I don't care what you have to say. As a Jets fan, your life is not that bad. As a fan I'm a Vikings fan. That's all I'm going to say. At least you have a ring
Yawn 🥱
A little dramatic Rich.  A 39 year old man that doesn't believe in science or medicine tore his Achilles tendon.  Quelle surprise !
Why not start the Jets show by talking about the Jets. Can you color the video with a green tint in post?
Its messed up i couldnt wait for this segment seconds after Rodgers went down 😂
I talked about the Vinny testaverde injury as my reason for having minimal hope and that last line was spot on… “football gods what do you want?” Just tell us
It could not have happened to a nicer person..Karmas a bitch
What that was all about was Josh Allen's complete regression.  He was unbeleivably careless with the football. Turnover happen, bad games by QB's happen.  However, if he keeps playing that carelessly, he wont be an NFL quaterback much longer.  That game had nothing to do with Zach Wilson, they won despite him, which has been the case everytime hes playing QB and the Jets win.
Wah!  You won the stupid game. Get over yourself.  FYI Scatman’s character was the cook.
I admire Rogers and his excellence, but we all know that the Jets suck.  They always have sucked.  They always WILL suck!  S-U-C-K…SUCK SUCK SUCK‼️
A friend of mine who had Jet season tickets for many decades said to me one time I'll never forget, "To be a Jet fan, you live through a lot of pain and suffering." Sad!  Same old Jets! 😢
Football Gods-You’re first born son!   Jets Fans-Done I can make another.
I empathize with Jets fans and Rich, and am rooting for Rodgers’ recovery, but this has to be the funniest sh*t I’ve watched in a long time 😅. Love this show
SERIOUSLY SUZY PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO AN INTERVENTION. HES GONNA HAVE A STROKE.  FOR THE JETS!!! 😂😂😂
Sucks Rodgers is injured. No one wants to see such an icon go down like that. That defense is top tier and they still can have an exciting season.
Had this been GRASS he wouldn't have had the injury...smh...
It's time for the second QB to play. It's meant to be. This is how it happens. Your only as good as your back up QB. My papa always said so.
Got nothing on lions fans.
A brilliant summation to the pain and agony we all felt as football fans, and particularly as a Packers fan who wanted to see Rodgers succeed not just for him but mainly for Rich and the long suffering Jets fan base.
Garrison Hearst, Steve Young, Alex Smith, Bowman, Garoppolo and then Nick Bosa.... I remember each heartbreak vividly.
I feel badly for the Rodgers and the JETS fans ... BUT only so much.  At least the Jets have won a Super Bowl (and arguably the "most important" Super Bowl win for the then-AFL).  And they have an incredibly stacked roster and appear positioned for future greatness for the next several years at least.  Try being a life-long Bills fan having NEVER seen the Bills win a championship.  UNTIL the Bills ever win a SB title (IF indeed they ever do within my lifetime), I can't stomach cry-babying from fans of teams who have at least attained the pinnacle once (or more) previously.
Game of Throws.
No one said you needed to be a Jets fan
Cleveland Fan born and bred....hold my beer
Don't ever change Jets. Watching the misery you cause your fans is delightful.
This reminds me of being at the last MN Viking outdoor game. Playoffs vs Seattle at MN Gophers stadium. It’s -30 something with windchill. My dad sees Bud Grant come out in a polo, he looks at us, and says “we are gonna loose. Like all 4 super bowls I went to.”
This NFL season feels like it will just have a giant * next to it
No 40 year-old has ever milked one Super Bowl more than that guy.  He is the master milker.
Guess vin testaverni was brought in since they couldn’t find a black cat ! Talk about a curse - the jets have a bambino class curse around their necks
Wow thats very interesting! And informative!
similar thing with thiesman and alex smith, similar injury, older QB in the stadium.
Awesome take BIG E
I think that's a good sign for Rodgers to retire, sadly.
Brutal. Just brutal. Feeling for the Jets and their fans
Say all you want, but I preferred watching him play football over all others.  Hey, that’s just me.
This is exactly what I expected from Rich.  As soon as Rodgers went down I couldn't wait to see how he handled last night.  And it didn't disappoint.  I have no dog in this fight, but the plot twists the league has come up with already this season are amazing.  Looking forward to the rest of the season and what they have cooked up.  Does Russell Wilson get redemption?  The Cowboys finally get over that Super Bowl hurdle?  Mayfield show he's more than just a commercial actor?  Maybe the Browns not only make the playoffs, but make the Super Bowl?  I don't know, but it will be fun.  P.S. Go Blue!
I don't wish injury on any player, even though Rodgers can be insufferable. Still, it's hard for me to understand the reaction of folks who treat Rodgers as if he had already won a Super Bowl for the Jets.  If this had happened in Green Bay, I can understand the grief of their fans, but Rodgers only played 4 downs for the Jets.  4 down.  He had no legacy with New York.  He's old.  He hasn't won a big playoff game in years.  I feel sorry for Jets fans who were ill-advised to project so many hopes onto a player before anything had actually happened.  National sports media forces all of us in other locales to put up with their biases and fandom  of their favorite teams, to the detriment of all the other teams.  I, for one, will not miss having to hear Eisen (& Greenberg) fanboying Aaron Rodgers ad nauseum for a full season.  The Jets can still be a fun, interesting team.  Football is a team sport.  Next man up, and give the other teams their due as well.
Jets fans are sado masochist.  I’m convinced!
Rich you jinxed him with all your jew worrying even in the preseason. Blame yourself.
I feel this man's pain
My heart and soul can’t take any more 😞
Jets need to look at DTR from the Browns. He looked really good this preseason. He is a young guy that can grow with all of this young talent. Athletic enough to play with this weak o-line
They shouldn't be looking for another QB, they should be looking to shore up that OLine. No one but Lamar could survive in that backfield.
Tell us how you really feel RICH! Sorry for your loss.
Thank you Rich,  I knew you would be able to articulate my 40 years of suffering . It ain't easy being green brother!
This just yet again proves the invaluable quality it is having a young talent like Wilson getting mentoring from a hof qb like rodgers. Sitting behind em n learning wat makes them great
Jets fans Rich aside are such obnoxious mooks that it’s fun to see them lose. This was too much.
Love the back to the future sound effect  Nice choice 👍
As someone who roots for a team that last went to a superbowl when I was 2, I can relate to a lot of this. I feel like about half the teams in this league feel pretty cursed.  It would almost be a better story for the franchise if Aaron coming in gave Wilson the reality check he needed, and maybe Aaron will be the best QB coach of all time. Because Rodgers can only have played for so long realistically.  And at the very least, maybe this disaster will be the push they need to finally replace that damn turf. My team plays there this year, and I'm almost hoping they sit the starters and take the loss just to avoid a potential disaster on that field.
Love that we are ALL... high or low... Faithfully and Fundamentally.. "FOOTBALL, ...ALL OF US! " Quote me use it
Something that these sports shows missed IMO was the sideline interview with Salah during the game.  They ask how the team can get passed the Rodgers injury and he has no answer. Kinda looks shell shocked. I was cracking up.
If the Jets would have made a play for Tom Brady BEFORE he left Tampa and tried to covet him FIRST instead of Aaron maybe he would have considered it,But TOM WILL NEVER PLAY SECOND CHOICE TO AARON RODGERS. NEVER.
Put this directly into my veins! Never go Full EISON!
As a former 'Aints' Baghead, I feel your pain Rich, just know it will get better, the Wheel Turns as the Wheel Wills.
This is kind of funny, given how much of a d-bag A-A-Ron is...
Get rid of that turf you want to save a few bucks by not paying some hard working men to take care of the grass and you get what you get by bieng cheap your future superbowl hooes gone gone gone gone.
Richard Todd has Cursed this Team!!
Why didn't I realize it was a former bear player that accidentally caused a injury to a former packer
Really appreciated the Back to the Future sound cue
Rodgers won his one and only superbowl 12 years ago when the Steelers gave him six turnovers. What has he done in the playoffs since ? Not much. Trust me, he would not have won the Super Bowl this year. No big loss to the Jets. Zach Wilson will be much better this season
It's time for Rich Eisen to forget the past and go all in on this very talented team. Every team, every game, every season presents hurdles to overcome.
0:39 the back to the future jingle there was a great touch
So sad they needed to keep him out of the stadiume
I knew they’d figure out a way to screw it up. 4 plays. 4 Freaking Plays.
Where is Mike White?
I feel ur passion and it hurts ur right rich
Horrible for not only Jet fans but football fans in general, we all lost out on a season of hopes and dreams
The Football Gods want Zach Wilson to lead the Jets into the playoffs.
As a Packers fan I’m so glad Aaron Rodgers is the QB of the Jets!
Rich, take heart. This will likely galvanize the coach and players.They will overcome  this obstacle and rally behind #2 who if you haven't noticed is playing better ball. Rushing out to get a replacement for Rodgers would not help support #2.
That really sucked… they need to change the stupid artificial turf there
Karma
Retirement is wonderful.
How come no mention of the missed penalty call on the punt return???
Rich in your lifetime the Jets have a Super Bowl Championship. As a lifelong Browns fan i have never experienced that, the last NFL championship the Browns won was in 1964 when i was five. In the eighties with Kosar we got our guts ripped out by Denver three times. I love you Rich but cry me a river. Namath guaranteed a win and then produced it but now Jets fans are going to pay for that forever. We have paid because Modell fired Paul Brown, who does that?
Rich - what was your favorite memory of Aaron Rodgers as a Jet? 😂
17 years on grass and only a few injuries.  Four snaps on turf.
He got the Corona calf.
No way.
It was a pretty rad 5 minute season.
So that means it would have happened on grass as well!
The picture of Rogers’ left foot/leg from the back was chilling. As a lifelong Cubs fan I can relate, Rich.
stop crying like a little girl
It ain't over yet with that team they're stacked so look for a veteran to show up
Scat Man Kruthers in The Shining 😂
Brett Farve tried the Jets life Sorry Rich I feel for you brother I really do
I hope we see Rodgers on the sideline mentoring/coaching up Wilson the rest of the season. The team’s going to need that leadership with him off the field.
Hey Rich!  Scooter MacGruder would be proud of your delivery.  I feel for you man.
J E T S --  JETs, JEts, Jets, jets ---  Rich, its the same Old Jets...
I feel sorry for Jets fans. They  can't  catch a break.
Well, Aaron Rodgers learned the hard way that the grass isn't always greener on the other green team...
Jets defense has been great. Selling tickets at QB has always been.
Scatman was the head chef but not a big deal of an error while recounting the worst pain a sports fan can feel
Zack Wilson did just beat the Bills.....3rd year pro and top pick. Slayer of cougars......
After watching 30 shows reactions to ln game, I like that this shows ad is only one to start off w Poise pad commercial for Rich before I hear a word from him
Mmmm tastes soo sweet
THATS WHAT YOU GET WHEN YOU PUT ALL YOUR EGGS IN AN OVERRATED FOSSIL BASKET.
AR got this achilles rupture do to being in an isolation room, AND NOT HAVING HIS COVID VAC.
Jets are the clippers of nfl
Nice back to the future sound drop
I sooooo called this one. I told everyone around me that Rodgers would go down in the first few weeks and be out. Im heading out the door to get some lotto tickets now. bwhahahashahahahah
Jets are cursed
zach wilson was playing for his life last night
Zack Wilson is not him!
The most tragic 9/11 in Rich's lifetime.
After the comment about whether he should play in pre season or not a couple of weeks ago, one of the guys called it “he could get hurt week 1!”  Can happen any time….and it always sucks.  As a 49er fan we found out last over and over again. Better luck next year Rich
People forget, not everyone is Ironman Brett Favre who NEVER missed a game, Arod is old and has never left Green Bay.. sad but not surprising
signing a HOF QB and having him get a season ending injury 4 plays into game 1 is such a Jets thing to happen 😆
im a Vikings fan  nuff said
I 2as in the Stands ,ookinng right down ghe yard markerwhen he had his injury Ruined a SB run Same deal here
Dont get too excited Rich. The Jets arent as good as they look, the Bills are just not as good as the media has made them out to be.
Poor Rich. I feel like i want to give him a hug! My heart goes out to all Jets fans
Just the best sports show out here…
You got there by having lousy turf
You have to feel bad for Jets fans……NAH 🤣🤣🤣
I like Aaron Rogers. He has been both a great and very entertaining player. He has played his last snap in the NFL. Recovering from an achilles tear is double tough when you are young.
The white elephant in the room is that the OL can’t protect the QB.  Neither can they create a lane for the RBs.  That RB who stutter steps needs to learn to go sideways when the lane is closed.
were gonna rally behind zach wilson and will play good football
Aaron may hang it up after this injury. He was already contemplating retirement. Tom Brady? Jets, Mets, Nets... All cursed.
I've been waiting all day for Rich's reaction.
Sorry Rich, but the Jets will be forever cursed by Dennis Erickson as he was the coach of the Seattle Seahawks on a December 1998 against your New York (Football) Jets. It was in that game that the Jets got their game winning touchdown when the officials ruled that Vinny Testaverde crossed the goal line when, in fact, he he was down at the half yard line (They, the officials, later claimed that they mistook Testaverde's helmet for the football). I still remember Bill Parcels' smug grin on his face during the post game news conference. I'm guessing the football gods remember it as well...
This post-Rodgers Jets team at best, could be something close the Dilfer-led Ravens; strong defenses and *good enough* QB play.  Playoffs still very reasonable goal but it'll be tough in the AFC East.  Tough loss for sure though.
Rich.... Rich.... Rich, I'm feeling for you right now.
You a legit nyj fan of your rocking a Wesley walker jersey
Rich hurtin 😭😭😭 I feel you my boy I’m sorry for your loss
Hey Jets..give Tim Boyle a chance
😂 I liken your starting QB to a beached whale. This is what you get for spending the last 2 months making fun of my team, The Indianapolis Colts, and our owner Jim Irsay.
Man Jets fans, I thought (as an Eagles fan since 1969) that going to only 1 SB during the 70’s 80’s and 90’s was tooo much to bear.  You guys have suffered waaay beyond what should be considered cruel by the football Gods.  I feel for all of you.
Mets , n Yanks , u can’t buy championships !!!!! Stop trying to do it !!!! Jets learn something!!!!
Namath really did sell his soul for the ring huh
Poor Rich 😂
Don’t worry Rich, us Raiders fans feel the same way. Any hope and/or excitement has an underlying feeling of dread or doubt..
Hell no I'll take Sam Donald before I'd take Carson wentz
Jon Bois and Secret Base should make their next series on the Jets
Blake Bortles is coming out of retirement to lead your 2007 Jaguars, I mean Jets .
I feel for Aaron and Rich
I’m not a Rodgers or a Jets fan but this situation really does suck for y’all. You guys have a great roster. I think they’ll be fine
Football deities showed the fans nothing should be taken for granted and one man is a small percentage of an NFL team.
The reason the Jets have all this bad luck is they won Superbowl III because the Colts owner had money on NYJ.  A crime they will pay for a very long time.
Tom Tupa the punter
I can’t believe that this guy calls himself a Jets fan but somehow did not see this coming. I predicted the specific injury before the game. My only shock is that he actually made it to the field before blowing out the Achilles. I was sure that it would happen in the locker room tying his shoes
vous êtes vraiment Excellent Rich
Bills fan here. You have a good team.  They fought and hung tough.  I cannot imagine having to deal with the shock of losing Rodgers 4 plays into the season, but they did. Congratulations
The jets gave up a lot to get 40 year old Aaron Rogers. The least they could’ve done was to improve their offensive line to protect him but they didn’t. So DUMB and SO JETS.
I hope Aaron a great recovery process, and hopefully he can join the team on the sidelines to mentor Wilson while he rehabs
This guy is clearly off his rocker!
Jets Fans': We gonna be really good this year!!! We're so excited for the season. We can't wait!!  Football Gods: I got you covered! 😉 😉 🤞
You’ll be thankful At the end Rodgers is Kirk cousins with good pr you will never win with trash
well we saw this coming on hard knocks..the protection was questionable at best.
They need to fix that damn turf
Rich and Greeny FROM ESPN shld talk about this
They should've made Josh Allen an honorary team captain for the Jets after the game.
I think, the next time Green Bay is looking to unload a used quarterback, the Jets should say in a polite tone, "thank you, but no."
Epic rant! While there's no chance in Hell of it happening, having Tommy sell his share of the Raiders and try to come back would be the story of the millennium...
As a Chiefs fan I do not know what is worse. Losing you QB so early or getting home field advantage multiple times and losing the first game.
This is my favorite sports talk show!
Do the NFL gods want Kaepernick back?
Dude only reason jets won that game is josh allens ego. He should have buried ur team as soon as #8 limped off the field, which actually was the highlite as far as i'm concerned.  And on behalf of every football fan outside NY, THANK U FOOTBALL GODS!!!! 😂😅😂😅😂😅
Sounds ironic. Wow unbelievable
This is legendary rich. A moment for the highlight reel
My apologies rich ❤
The karma train always hits hard. You can’t just hold 2 organizations hostage and expect to walk away scott free
Boo hoo Detroit Lions haven't won anything meaningful since what 1995
So the NFL doesn't have enough money for a grass fields n gardeners???🤔🤔🤔 why do that when turf is a one time buy 😅 damn that's cold
The fact that the Jets have so much talent and will still only win 8 games or so because lack of a competent QB will make it even more painful!
Hard Knocks was just an 80's movie about the time that Aaron Rodgers blew his wad at summer camp.
Join the club bro. Your team sucks just like half of the rest of the nfl teams.
The football gods GAVE you Super Bowl III......and you will forever be paying for it, so it seems.
Fun commentary
If Rodgers had played I believe this would have been an absolute blowout by the Jets...what a crappy break :(
I thought of this segment the moment it happened
That looked like a ski jumper's ankle in that still shot, Leonard finished it off for good measure
Rich, until Namath goes, the Jets are not free to have a great QB lol
As Rogers sat back down I said “ you have got to be FKn kidding me “ I repeated it about 48 times tjats all I could say and when I saw the cart I said it louder then when I saw the boot I yelled it louder “ YOU HAVE GOT TO BE FKN KIDDING ME “ my wife asking WHAT WHAT Happened all I could say was you have got to be kidding me
4 snaps, by number 8, who formally played as number 12... Irony?
Vinny T was my favorite QB, last night was a horror show. Basically typical Jets football
I dont think any of those quarterbacks would be able to do much behind that O line
Testaverde, Pennington, Favre, and now Rodgers.
The staff should call for a commercial to telll rich he is melting down. No support for this raider lover jets beliver. Now a new belief in wilsson. Geez. Lmao
Sorry Rich. Any thoughts to finally making MetLife grass?
I’m sorry Rich. You have my full empathy and sympathy.
Rich's rants are the best
If tails never fails, inspect your coins.
Remember;  The only time Zach Wilson EVER looked like anything remotely resembling a starting QB was that 4th quarter last year at *aCrIsUrE* against Michael "Genius" Tomlin.
sure the doctors said rodgers tore his achilles, but whats joe rogans diagnosis?
Rodgers was a old man. What did the jets expect
I was waiting for this from rich as soon as it happened
I was waiting for this from rich as soon as it happened
Excellent ❤ 16:18
Big mouth nothing.
The only reason the jets won this game is because Josh Allen handed it to them with all the turnovers, also a special teams punt return td isn’t something u can rely on
Sorry 😂 Rich 😅
5 snaps really.
There is a CURSES.
Cry me a river. Other teams have had it worse.
Brilliant from Rich. As a 9er fan i was rooting for Jets to climb the ranks. So gutted for Jets fans. Battle on👊
Tom Brady has seen the Jet's offensive line. He ain't coming
As a Lions fan I can feel this soooooo much.
That’s some bad juju
It's a cursed franchise. They were going to have a rough time with the Cowboys WITH Rodgers. With WILSON ...... they'd better run the ball 65 times and let the D win that game.
Im a packers fan and was glad aron rogers didn't retire.  I was so pumped for the jets i uped my nfl package so i could watch the packers and jets. I am so bummed that arod got hurt. I feel for the jets. Go jets go!
Greatest Tuesday of my 56 year long life.  Watching the Jets Fans hopes go up like the Hindenburg Disaster some 86 years before lets me know that we can count upon those that sow the wind shall reap the whirlwind. Knowing that this is playing out just like the Brett Farr Fiasco lets me point a finger at Rogers and give the most sarcastic, and sincere laugh that is attainable by someone of the human race.  I cant think of 2 entities, Rogers and Jets, that more deserve this and each other's misery more.
Rich cover hockeey. Football isnt your field of dreams. Raider lover. 😅
On the plus side, the Jets are on pace to go undefeated this year.
This is the worst thing to happen to New York on that date…
😂😂rich is the best
Regret Life Stadium claims another lower leg injury victim. I really don't want my team or any team to have to play there this season.
3 of Allen’s turnovers were unforced, if he just plays smart then the bills win
Ya but your looking at 3-3 at the end of week 6 either way and the bills beat themselves cuz Josh was throwing to the jets all night and even fumbling. It’s great the keys got the win they shouldn’t ever have had but enjoy that while it lasts
This is hilarious hahahahahahahaha
At least the Bears are not cruel enough to give us Bears fans false hope.
Tom Brady to the JETS?!
so who's the QB this year ... ?   who available ? ... yeah, not Zach
The jets are cursed. Pats fan would just like to say i was excited to see the revamped rivarlies in the AFC east but the gods of football just seem to hate the jets just as much as I do. Terrible moment for anyone though. Hope for a speedy recovery 🙏
Rich your raiders are on the move. Are you picking them to win the afc west in 2023 ?😮
Lol
Is Rich really performing this monologue off the cuff? He isn't reading. Doesn't even appear to be peaking at what might be notes. Impressive. 👏
I blame the turf.  How can teams invest so much in players, then put them out on that crappy stuff?
LEAVE BRADY OUT OF YOUR PASSION PLAY …because y’all know damn well you’d just end up breaking him, too.
Yeah, but...how shocked can one seriously really be for the Jettiest thing happening right as the season kicks off to....the damn Jets?
4th time I've watched this, and it just keeps getting funnier to watch.
It was a great 4 months
Not even a Jets fan and I just wanted to see Aaron Rodgers play
Raider's fan here. Feel bad for Jet's fan base.  I personally wanted to see Carr on the Jet's.
It's very simple. We find Joe Namath's horcruxes and we start destroying them. I think we should start with that fur coat of his.
This is what happens when you mix a HOF QB with a terrible OL...
The Jets arnt cursed... the turf is just bad.
😂 jets
Im a Lions fan, welcome to the pity party.
I know its still early but nice to see Zach get a win, not just in the game, but seems like he’s figuring his stuff out
Un Freaking Real. When Carlson Palmer, the Bengals best QB since Boomer and our best chance to win our first playoff game since dinosaurs roamed the earth, went down on a low leg hit while throwing a 50yd bomb to Ochocinco on the first pass from scrimmage against our nemesis Steelers at home....I felt like a Jets fan.
Easily the worst thing to ever happen to New York involving a jet.
..........from the heart Rich, from the heart.........
I feel for you Rich, the Jets fans, and of course Aaron Rodgers, wishing him a speedy and full recovery!  The closest i can come to the Jets curse is to move to baseball and my childhood team- the Pittsburgh Pirates. Quite possibly the organization in all of sports. I will turn 40 next year and havent even seen one playoff ROUND won in my entire lifetime, forget a World Series. Im still haunted by Sid effing Bream somehow beating Barry Bonds throw to home plate to win the 92 NLCS game 7 for the Braves and start 20 years of losing for the Bucs. Now they are busy ruining any and all prospects and young players they have with the worst development staff in sports- their hitting coach tells the players to NOT SWING to run up opposing pitchers pitch count, even if that pitcher is throwing strikes consistently. And several pitchers have lost 5-10 mph of velocity due to whatever nonsense their pitching coach is spewing. Its only a matter of time until they ruin generational prospect Paul Skenes and his 102 mph fastball, once they dig their claws in id expect him to be throwing in the low 90s. And yet there is talk of the manager, pitching, and hitting coach all returning for the 24 season! Tell me you dont care about winning without telling me you dont care about winning. Absolutely disgraceful for a once proud franchise.
he's off the deep end 😆
Why us Richard??? Did we make a deal with the Devil on the night before Super Bowl 3???? From 1969 until now, we just haven’t gotten things right at the Quarterback position!!
The Jets made it to the AFC Championship game with Sanchez & that top 3 defense. Zach just has to be better than Butt-Fumble & it could happen again.
As a Jet hating Dolphins fan, I hate seeing injuries like that but Im not sad that the Jets will struggle.  Add the fact that Dalvin Cook went there for Rodgers. It's all bitter sweet.
How many more injuries do we need to see in the NFL because of artificial  turf? Honestly’ you didn’t hear about injuries occurring as often or severe back in the day. I submit that the reason was everyone played on natural grass. If your favorite team uses Artificial turf think about how many leg injuries it’s caused over the years.
While I'm not a Jets fan I feel bad for them. All the excitement of veteran winner Aaron Rodgers joining your team and looking forward to a great season and then this happens.
Jets gonna be ok. Zack Wilson is gonna have superb season. The next five games are gonna be brutal. But I'm calling it. They will make the playoffs. Playoffs!?!?!
A date that will live in infameh .
Injuries are basically why I’m barely watching the NFL anymore They’re only going to get worse.
60 million guaranteed in Arron’s contract, not bad if your name is Arron Rogers, for 4 plays 😎
Technically Aaron Rodgers is 1-0 as a Jet starter
I'm a Bills fan, but what happened last night was the most Jets thing I could imagine.
*
The Jets are STUPID for signing an old man that is past his prime. STUPID move!! Waste of time, money and energy!! The Jets could have had a Super Bowl caliber roster. They instead got robbed by a loudmouth bum!!!
Good Lord ….. Go visit a Children’s Hospital …. See people with real struggles …. Get a life
I actually think this injury is going to propel the negative emotions into fighting for this season dedicated to Rodgers since of what he brought to this team. Wait and see. Keep the faith Jets fan. Imagine how bad if we lost. 1-0 baby!
False hope will give you more grievance down the line.
It's all up to Rodgers if he wants to rehab and come back or call it quits 🙏🏾 I hope he gets well soon
As a Browns fan hoping for a Browns vs Jets AFC championship game one day
You should want to talk about Wentz or Foles.  Don’t give the season to Zach,  within 3 years, half of the young studs will be free agents and the d will be watered down!
As a dolphins fan I did not want this to happen because I wanted to beat the Jets with Rodgers. The balls on Keith olbermann blaming the injury on Rodgers because he didn't get the c0vid shot. What a prick!
Damn Rich....thats some cold blooded s*#& that happened to you last night. Freaking Vinny!
You were the first person I thought of when Aaron went down.  I’m sorry 😢!
My Father was 17 when the Jets won the 1969 Superbowl. He has been a fan since day one when He and my Grandfather went to opening day of the Jets first season years before the Superbowl victory. He has endured so much as a Jets fan, like Rich and so many other dedicated fans have. Over the years I have teased him mercilessly through bad season after bad season. Teased him through good seasons that everyone knew would end as all Jets seasons end, badly. Teased him when the Jets organization was voted as the worst professional sports franchise. This year he was more hopeful and more excited than I had seen him in a very long time. Even though my friends and I all joked about how Rodgers would inevitably get injured first drive and his career would end as a Jet, I just couldnt tease my Dad about it. I wanted him to have a great season. I wanted him to finally have what he and so many others have waited for. All I could do last night was hug him. I know the season isnt over but that was such a tremendous gut punch when Rodgers went down. Sorry for your misery Jets fans. This season Im a Jets fan too. You are loved 🤗
It was a fake injury. They told him to take a fall. They don't want him in the league but firing his is bad optics so they made him fake an injury and he will now "retire"
More money then brains. Why are they still playing on an artificial surface? Player safety doesn't matter I suppose. How can a billion dollar industry, not provide the safest possible playing surface for its product? Epic fail.
I do agree that the Jets’ defense was absolutely lights out last night. They really put on a clinic.  They put the rest of the NFL on notice. Side note: glad Garrett Wilson was in my fantasy lineup.  And curtain call for Special Teams- that last play, WOW!!!
Wilson got to see what an alpha qb and alpha locker room guy, does, how they prepare, tips, maybe Rogers will become Vito working to groom Michael Corleone. Kind of a player/coach/ consigliere.
I’m a Bear fan!!!  I feel your pain 😢.
Poor Rich. Watched the game and was anticipating his reply on the show. Sure it's about entertaining his fanbase but man...I feel for him, genuinely. I'm a life long Steelers fan and always check on the Jets to see how they're doing as well on Sundays just for Rich. Hang in there, Jets fans.
"Axe to the chest....Axe to the chest....."  😀
At least you're taking it like a good soldier ...well a soldier before a firing squad on christmas day.
As a lifelong browns fan I empathize with you jets fans! Hope wilson can play some good ball for you
…And you saw Josh Allen  channel Carson Wentz
Honestly was waiting all day for this take/video. Amazing. Going Viral
Football Gods want Joe Namath. He sold his soul for a Super Bowl
Calm down Rich
This sucks
I wouldn't blame luck, I'd blame the O line.
At least Eisen understands we cant have nice things. Younger fan base is all bright eyes and hopeful, havent been through enough of this yet to listen to us "bitter old fans"
what did the giants and jets do to piss off the football gods
I'm not even a Jets fan and I found that injury gut-wrenching. With all sincerity, Jets fans, you have my condolences.  This is just awful and no fan base deserves this.
Football gods will answer that this season ,  Jets will compete!!
Jets tried, but you can beat Washington with Alex Smith and Joe Theismann on the same day, same gross injury.  I know the pain the Jets are feeling, too well
It was like watching someone getting shot live on TV. It also didn't help they had to show it over and over and over again.
Omg dude this is wild
Man i feel real sad for jets fans..im a niner fan and i was excited to see them play. Crazy. I dont wish injuries on any team unlike eagle and cowboy fans 🖕🏼
When adversity strikes a team, it’s up to other teammates … as well as coaches, to step up their game and provide new leadership. You saw it in GB week 1, and you saw it Monday night. Time for new leaders to emerge and earn their next contract.
He should retire
6:28 lmao. Rodgers at best had 3 years left in him and to think he could magically transform  Zach Fucking Wilson into an even decent QB is delusional. Jets fans are known for their delusions but thats next level
Who's idea was it to hire a 39 year old man to play football. Aaron should have retired.
This was...sensational.
Yeah, but did y’all win last night (and mess up my fantasy) or not?😂😂😂
Watch the Jets roll with emotional boost, I see the Jets  coming together and having a season to be talked about for years. Don't give it up Jet fans, come together and make it a magical season .  You heard it here first , remember that in January .  Go Jets... .
Rich is hilarious
One of the greatest rants in the history of sports
How will the Jets lift the Joe Namath Super Bowl III Curse? What deal with the Devil did Namath make to get that victory??
When will the NFL ban turf!! It has already taken down two of my favorite players. It turns out it wasn't Brett's fault, the Jets are just cursed
🙋‍♂️It’s your turf. Your turf is turd.
So is the NFL rigged?
Technically it was 5 snaps...
3:58 man
Vinny Testaverde's appearance as a honorary captain gives me a chill. You cannot write a scrip like that even in Hollywood.
Admit super bowl 3 was rigged and the curse ends
Aaron Rodgers is a great actor making millions sitting on the bench 😊
The football gods are just so cruel 😢
You had me until “call Tom”  Ain’t happening.
Zack Wilson now has the best personal QB trainer possible. I'm sure Aaron will be in the building coaching Zack up. Jets are going to be fine. AFC championship game for sure. You can take it to the bank.
The only good thing is we going to keep our first round pick
That Vinny factoid was perfect. I don’t think anyone besides die-hard Jets fans knew that was a thing. Oh how funny the universe works
Enough already, who cares about these overpayed jagoffs.
Rich is GREAT!!
Now we can stop hearing about Rogers and the Jets. I am sick of the noise. It is over and so is the Jets season.
If the Ravens can go to a Super Bowl with Trent Dilfer at QB and suffecating defense. The Jets might still have a chance....
I feel for u Rich!
I saw this news online at work this morning and immediately thought of Rich! haha I thought, Oh the pain, the agony and despair he must be feeling. haha If ever there was a cursed NFL team, It's the Jets!
I’m sorry to all Jets fans.
Rich, I feel for you big time. But I couldn't wait to hear you today. I think it really sucks though, cause I'd rather see Rodgers out there playing. I actually had the Jets losing to KC in the AFC Championship this year. I think it sucks for any NFL fan, except maybe the other team in the AFC East. Once again I feel for you, but Steelers fans aren't feeling much better. The Steelers were awful in every aspect of the game Sunday & now horrible news about Cam Hayward. Best of luck to you & your Jets the rest of the way.
"What the hell is he doing there!!?" 😱😅😅😅
16 Vinny + 8 Aaron = 24.. on the 24th anniversary of Vinny’s exact same injury. Coincidence?!? I think so…
Deja Vu and Murphy's Law... Nothing more to say.
Jets win was a product of a series of flukes.
its namaths curse. STory goes he prayed to win the superbowl but supposedliy he worded it by saying God let us win this game and i wont ask for another 1 as long as i live.  meaning the SB
The Jets OT that whiffed on that play owes the entire Jet fan base an apology and return his salary for what he just cost that franchise.
Ive been waiting all day to hear Richs reaction to last night. I hate the jets but have some empathy I will admit.
😅
I normally can't wait to laugh at rich's depression over being a jets fan but i just feel sad for you guys
This is the most jets thing ever. As a pats fan im cool with it.
Rodgers shouldn't have tried to stay on his feet, he should've done the Matt Ryan tuck and fall. And yes, I'm a Falcons fan.
💀💀💀💀💀💀
The Jets are cursed.
Now just going to a season of death by thousand papper cuts.
Eli Tomac and now  Rodgers. Making way for some young blood.
Poor Rich....
The Aaron Rodgers trade was an "all eggs in one basket" undertaking and no one should risk everything on the success of one venture. If the Jets are any good, they should make the playoffs with Zach Wilson. If not, they will continue to languish.
This is what happens when you don’t want to retire
So wait a minute! Why is it, that the 2nd pick from the draft 2 years ago, is so so horrible, that everyone is convinced that there is no possibility that he can't grow into the job? Maybe, just maybe, the football gods have actually done a good thing, and said" nope" you've had numerous high draft pick QBs, and you've panicked and gotten rid of all three of them, and this time you don't get to. This is the bed you made, and instead of just lying in it, you have to embrace it. Stop looking for someone riding in on a white horse to save you, and just get to work. You have an amazing defense, a great running game, receivers who can get things done and an o-line that's pretty darn good. What do you have to lose? Everyone expects your season to be over with. Jet's fans expect the season to be over with. How about spending the season trying to reclaim Z Wilson and make him into the serviceable QB that I think can be done. He certainly seems more mature than last year. He doesn't need to be all world, he needs to be good enough. Stranger things have happened. Brock Purdy went from the last pick in the draft, to probably a pro bowl player. Josh Allen crapped the bed, and played one of the worst games of his life. I actually think there might be a thing of beauty buried beneath all the crap of unrealistic expectations.
It’s not funny but this is soooo FUNNY!!!😂😂😂
Biggest week one winner - Green Bay  Stop whining about how tough it is being a Jets fan. The Jets have won a super bowl. Try being a fan of the Vikings, Lion's, Browns, Chargers etc.
Amazing!
same ol' Jets
Rich went through all the stages twice over
2:59  "What the hell is HE doing there?!" OMG Rich, you're kill'n me.
OMG . You can't make this sheet up .  I knew he  would be injured , just not that quickly  .I was a Jets fan in the 60s. Joe N  days.  Not since . Never  again . Poor bass turds .
Because Rodgers is unwittingly forfeiting himself to entities horror movies are based on every time he does transcendental meditation and reaches a new stage of "enlightenment."
As soon as I saw he was injured, I felt gutted for Greeny and Rich. As a Niners fan, I'll always rock with Saleh and McDaniels but they got our 49ers luck with qbs.
man i feel so bad for jets fans. but hey at least you're not a bears fan.
Jets poverty is getting depressing
Rodgers faked a n injury, to commemorate 9/11
Jets. Giants. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Adips to Joe and Slarh. They failed to protect a 100+ million dollar asset Also fire the OL coach craig. He was crap at the Titans. Probably  fire Hackett for allowing Craig to continue to coach
We can never have nice things.
in the still image , you can see Rodger's calf muscle all retracted into a ball ..game set match bye bye
We're you crying all night Rich? I hear it in your voice
This injury is probably won of the worst injuries to a franchise I’ve seen and I’m not a jets fan
hey did Rich see what happened to Aaron Rodgers?
ok but can you stop yelling
I am looking forward to a niner jet Super Bowl…cmon guys don’t give up…your defense is great!
The Jets perhaps found out that they are much better than anybody (even Rich and their own upper management) thought they were. If they go on and win it will be THEIR success and not Aaron Rodgers'. Their defense was already a known quantity. What they possibly have that they didn't have during any point of Zack Wilson's tenure is a running game. Breeze Hall looked great and so did the other RBs. A quarterback doesn't have to be a miracle worker with that, he only needs to not make unforced errors. I'm personally a Chiefs fan but I'm pulling for the Jets (the team of my childhood) to succeed... except for the Chiefs game, of course. :-)
LOL
American Football sucks because of injuries. It rips your heart out when this happens to your QB. I'll now watch Messi at Inter Miami instead. That will be way more enjoyable
This is like  kd injury in 2019 finals
Fitzmagic is back baby.
Boooooooooring
So sorry for Jets fans; what a bummer to have so looked forward to having a hall of famer QB take the reins and then poof, done in one series in the first game.  Ugh.  Awful luck.
Glass half full POV…the jets now have the best and highest paid unofficial QB coach AND OC!  Wilson now gets all the snaps under the tutelage of Aaron flippin Rodgers.    This could be a fantastic nfl storyline
You can't make this stuff up.  Amazing....
Poor Rich 😂
JYINX testaverdi is a JYINX
Rich…BIG fan. You are the BEST sir!!!TY
As a lifelong Falcons fan, I empathize with Jets fans. However, nothing will ever feel as bad as losing a 28-3 lead in the SB. Nothing!
Darn Rich my heart goes out to you guys.  Great win by your team sad day.
Absolutely epic!!😂🤣
An undercurrent of Muhahahaha  You think you date Miss Anerica she turns out to be Dylan Mulvaney
Don't know why rodgers was carrying the flag out, he's a big 9/11 conspiracy theorist, maybe it was karma
The NFL is scripted
Rodgers money is guaranteed right?
If this is how u act as losers, just imagine how unbearable they'd be if they ever win anything. Sheesh
As a Steelers fan, I'm just glad that people aren't picking on us anymore haha  It can't be fun being a NY fan on either side.
😂😂😂😂 I’m so glad 😂😂😂😂
18750000 per play priceless
Possibly Dick Vermeil once felt that way and asked similar questions.  We can only wait and see if the Jets can dig deep and show what what they’re made of in the face of adversity.  To me that’s the best answer.
I would think Jets fans would never actually get hopeful about anything. I dont know what they did to piss off the football gods but the Jets just seem to be a cursed franchise.
Great analogy of the Shining used😂😂 It's sad for Jets fans but there's quite a lot of Franchises whose fan bases are starved of success, take a ticket!  Every teams season can end with their QB being injured. The situation is hyped because of the hype, hard knocks, Rodgers etc its further than normal to fall for Jets fans.  Great win by the way but the Bills threw this away with awful picks again. What the hell has Allen been working on this off season? 2022 rinse repeat
I love your passion. I love the Tom Brady idea.
As someone who has torn two ACLs, I cannot believe turf continues to be used. That stuff is horrendous.
Epic rant. I feel for you, Rich.
This is exactly what I was waiting for lmao. Thanks Rich 😂
Don't blame the football Gods lol I'm a packer fan and I never thought arodgers would go to the Jets cause their Oline situation was beyond awful and when he did I thought he was insane and it's really on the Jets for having that Oline and basically putting the same thing on the field and expect them to protect a guy that can't move well anymore
It’s fair to say the Packers won the divorce!
Go get Kaepernick.
This is how Aaron Rodgers story leads him to the Vikings, Turns out Aaron Rodgers continues to build up Zack during the season where Zack shows he's a franchise Qb by week 18. Rodgers gets released and off he goes to win a SB with the Vikings before retiring.
4 snaps!!! Brett Favre struck again!
I'm so mad here from Buffalo but congrats
I was waiting on this alllllll day
We lost 4 QBs in a season, 2 in the same Championship game! Yeah I get the frustration in your voice
Eisen is the best!!!
now you know how it feels to be an Angel fan.
The beauty and curse of American football is that it is so dependent upon having a good or great quarterback. I feel bad for the Jets. Die hard fans let down again.
Yet again there will be no Rodgers vs Mahomes match up. Get well, Aaron. Go Pack Go.
Hope is such a tease.  It's like a dangling carrot.  Maybe Zach Wilson will be enough.  The Jets have plenty of good players.  Zach doesn't have to be super man.
Enter Philip Rivers
I expected something bad to happen.  It always happens to the jets.  A dog ripped my Al Toon jersey.    Been bad ever since.
Typical Jets
Tom Brady wants nothing to do with that offensive line.
This is a great rant. Now that the jets are done for the season, Rich can jump back on the Raiders bandwagon.  😂
Yes it was, the drama, the lead-in, then what??  horror show if there ever was one.
I couldn't sleep last night wondering how Rich was going to react to this 😈
I know the feeling
$15 million per minute- lol only the jets
I feel like I rarely heard anyone talk about how many hits Aaron has taken before getting to NY... more than favre in less games and favre was a freaking tank..  *Most Sacked QBs  Tom Brady: 565 (335 games played)  Ben Roethlisberger: 554 (249 games played) Aaron Rodgers: 531 (231 games played) Brett Favre: 525 (302 games played) John Elway: 516 (234 games played)
Try being a Bills fan.
Should have retired a packer could be off on a beach eating magic mushrooms probly would have had a street named after you and your number retired at lambo field .
meanwhile, in Green Bay, a fanbase sighed with relief.
“I’m not rational now”.  No…you’re not.
Yall whole team got cocky n start feeling themselves thats how u got here i dont feel sorry for a guy thats earn almost half a billion in earnings its life get over it.....
jets could'nt win if they were the only ones playing.
I cant believe the amount of emotions I went thru last night along with thousands of others
The only way to break the curse is to save Namath’s soul
It was the 22nd remembrance of 9/11. Fck Roger's.
Poor Rich.  He's such a good guy, and he has been so hyped about this season ever since the Aaron Rodgers signing.  He has been drinking the HOF Kool-Aid and you could see that it was eventually going to end up in a train wreck, kind of like it did with Brett Favre in Minnesota.  Still, it could have been a really nice run for Rich and the Jets fans.  For the rug to be pulled out from under them as quickly as this was just horrible though.  Nobody deserves that.  I'm really sorry, Rich.  I hope you and Jets Nation get better in the years ahead.
Axe in the chest.  Jet's need to do some weird ceremony to cleanse this curse
As a lifelong Jets, I would have been more surprised if Rodgers did not have a season ending injury on day one.  I will be even more surprised if we see him in a jet uniform again.
Testaverdy curse 😮
"Robert Saleh celebrating like he has a uniform on." Best line of the day... We were all in the end zone... 😅
Jets are cursed. Go Chargers... and Clippers.
All this hype for Rodgers to retire a Jet after playing 1 series 😭😭
My condolences Rich!
After last night, brady wouldn't pick up the phone. He wants his Achilles intact
Long suffering Jets fan here…I’m old enough to remember Neil O’Donnell (another high cost, super bowl playing qb signing) suffering a season ending injury by running on the field. We are so cursed.
1999 was the year I was born and I am their curse.😂😂😂😂😂
Well 5 snaps if you count the Achillies tendon 😂
I'm no Jets fan, but I definitely want to see them do well because I know there's alot of people in the city that need it, so my heart goes out to Rodgers and NY ❤ - from a Cowboys fan
You can hear genuine dispair in Rich's voice.  Freaking turf strikes again.  As a Redskins/Commanders fan, I certainly feel for this poor man.  We've been snake bitten for quite some time as well.
Iam a Raven fan and am really disturbed by five of our best players got hurt and JKDobbins out for year with Achilles. Its dejuve all over again. When I watched the Jet game last night and the collaborations of 911, then the standing ovation for Roger's was so beautiful then 4 snaps later its over made me really disturbed!!!! Rich I couldn't sleep last night!!!! What an unbelievable bumber!!!!bummer!!!!!
You had me up till Tom Brady
Rich and Chris, your next fantasy team name?  “Four Snaps”
I, too, was at the Broncos/Jets AFC championship game, as a Broncos fan. My brother and I went and when we heard high in the 20s for a January game we were pumped. Fake out. That was the coldest game I had attended because the wind blew 60-80 mph and the wind chill was horrid. Plus Elway couldn't throw in that wind and thank God for TD and the running game. The Jets were good that year. Too bad about Vinnie. I'm not the world's greatest Rodgers fan but I think Wilson (both of them) will keep them in the playoff hunt.
I fullly blame the NFL for this. The Giants played on the same field in rainy conditions Sunday night. How the NFL didn't see to it the field should by as dry as possible is upsetting to me. I cant see Rodgers going out like this
Chad Pennington gave the J-E-T-S hope until the 1st of his 4 Tommy John shoulder surgeries!
4 snaps and a tear
Nfl is so scripted. The injury was real and sad but the outcome was premeditated.
The football gods want you to sign a female kicker to break the curse.  Lol
I'm a falcons fan. Cry me a river
How many ligaments and tendons have to be torn apart before we ban artificial turf?
That schedule with that offensive line.
I think Joe Namath made a deal w the 😈. Money, fame, a ring, no more Jets wins.
When was the last time the Jets won a season opener? It's a stat that I literally cannot find and I'm genuinely curious.
I truly feel for Jets Fans can’t even imagine how it would feel!
I’m not even a jets fan and I’m pissed that we got robbed of watching history this season with him.
I'm sorry to say this...4 SNAPS! Needs to be on T shirt😂. Joking aside, this blows for Jets fans and all of football. Aaron Rodgers is one of those greats that elevates EVERY team's play, to just hang in there with him. Wishing for a speedy recovery and a GREAT comeback, should he decide to.🙏🏼❤️
Will never see Mahomes vs Rogers bowl
As a packers fan i was pumped for the jets game. That sucks about rodgers, but damn that ended up being a great jets game. Im rooting for the jets to do some good things this year. Maybe a miracle will happen and rodgers can make it back late in the season and get the jets to the big ahow afterall.
Uncle Rich took us back to 1999.. pain
By "football Gods" you mean the script writer(s) portrayed by Keegan Michael Key right?😊
Rich,    My condolences on your loss.  I hope Aaron heals well and is back next year.  We loved you at Channel 7R in Redding, CA.  We love Mike Mangas too!  John McHatton
As a giants fan, we are also cursed
Jets suck, Rodgers sucks more! Goodbye jets!
Jets fans went thru this with Vinny years ago.  Damn turf
In order to reverse the Jets curse you must kill the one who sold his soul. Joe Namath must be sacrificed to win another SB.
No one feels bad for jets fans. We feel bad for Aaron.
I'm sorry, rich. But this is Karma from all the way back to 2008. When all of JETS nation. Laughed, cheered and partied celebrating Brady going down on the first drive in the patriots season opener.
Axe in the chest! 💀🤣✌🏽
Omg! I am so sorry for Jets fans! That gives even more perspective to the fact that your team is cursed. You need to do a mass saging or exorcism or something. Also, I am a Packer fan so was watching last night and was in shock.
Man oh man  Wow
God hates the Jets Namath had to do some ungodly things in the 50s lol
Stop whining, your a Jets fan! This is the way!
Sign Cam Newton
Time to start his healing regimen of ivermectin and pomade
You nailed the way I've felt since then me Eisen. Omg you took me down a most painful memory Lane 😢
This is on Keith Carter.
Cowboys fan here.  So sorry for Aaron Rogers and the Jets fans, especially you, Rich.  I'm one of those low-key Aaron Rogers fans, the human being/athlete, and I too was very hopeful for the second coming of Aaron Rogers and the Jets.  My God, the IRONY of this situation is so PALPABLE, and the "THIS IS NOT FAIR" argument would make a convincing case in the court of football law(wouldn't win, but a case could definitely be made).   As a skeptic, I don't believe in anything supernatural anymore, but all this talk about the "HBO Hard Knocks, football gods, Jets are cursed, Vinny Testaverde jinx, etc. is very convincing sports drama.  As sad as this loss is for the Jets, I know the Cowboys ain't going to lighten up one bit next week.  The Cowboys are going to capitalize on this QB loss next week when the Jets come to "Jerry World."  And y'all seen the beat down the Cowboys defense gave the Giants last Sunday night.  How good will the Jets defense play against the Cowboys offense?  They don't have a chance if they can't keep the score low.  Again, my condolences to the entire Jets fan base, players, and organization.  Rich, you're the best of them all, imo.  So sorry, bro.  NEXT MAN UP! 😳😳
In the history of the Jets, this has got to be one of the most cruel things to happen to them.
My team threw a pick on the 1 yard line to lose the super bowl.  Hard knock life as a fan sometimes…
Guess he should have gotten more pliability training.
Joe Namath sold his soul and the soul of the Jets to the Devil so he could guarantee winning Super Bowl 3. Unfortunately, it meant the Jets would never sniff another one for eternity.
Being a fan of the  N.Y. Jets  must be a horror show.   I think the moral of the story is to never sign older veteran QB's from Green Bay with a D- offensive line. That is strike two for acquiring GB QB leftovers.
You are probably better off without Rodgers. 13 years since he won the biggie . Give the new guy a shot
Well, well, well. Richard Eisen, we will miss you... hope you get better soon or later or???
Is anyone checking on Rich? 😅
Rich...  Rich...  Rich...  You know in your heart Ay-ay-ron is going to be the Vikings qb next year...  'Call Tom Brady...'  That was inspired!
It’s the curse of SB3. You sold your soul to win a game you had no business being in against the Baltimore Colts. You’ve been paying for it since then.
Zach Wilson played his peak football last night...which is 1-2 great throws and 1-2 turnovers. The defense, the running game and special teams won the games....just like last year!!
Rich is a scumbag, he wronged Theo von so he’s my enemy
I thought being a chargers fan, we were cursed. But Jesus jets fans take the cake, truly devastating what happened. Defense is a superbowl winning defense. Brutal
Wonder why he didn’t bring up the jets season opener in 98?
uhhh chill out bro the jets suck 😂
I don't believe in curses, but... ya'll might be cursed.
Why do the football gods hate the Jets? Well, it's not actually the Jets they hate Rich. The issue can be summed up in one word..."Woody".
Well jet fans fans the ravens won a super bowl with a shiity qbs flacon dilfer so u Still have a chance
LMAO.... Aaron Rodgers should write his resignation letter on a napkin. 🖕Jets!
Been waiting all day for this video, sorry rich!
I think Mr. Eisen would respond well to hydrotherapy... on the other hand he might not...  😂 😂
Yeah, call me crazy but I’ve been saying this for months. I’m not entirely convinced that we have seen the last of Tom Brady. I could see a quarterback going down on a talented team and giving Tom a call.
Damn sorry rich🥲
Talking about “manifesting” and “speaking things into existence” too - that woke stuff!  It’s true but, damn - tuff way to go out.
Haha I love it !!! Go bills
5* snaps, Rich.
As a Bengals fan  I sympathize with you guys.  Tough break
This has similar memories of Marvin Harrison in 07 at 35yrs old against Denver in Indy hurting his left knee by own teammate being tackled behind him blocking. He wasnt the same after that. Reggie Wayne in 2013 a few weeks before 35 against Denver in Indy ofc, tore his acl. Came back the next season but had subpar numbers similar to Marvin then retirement after
What do the football gods want? They want Jet Fan to stop frigging whining and man up.
Rich is going to have to eat his words when this team makes the Superbowl later this year.  Oh, wait...he was talking about the Jets?  Forget the above
Jets needed to get Rodgers a top 10 line if they wanted him to stay healthy. They refused to invest properly to do that. You can't plug a 40 year old QB in who was injured all last season behind a good line and think he'd be ok on turf behind a bad line.
I feel for you Richard . you all have been punked
Football gods: Give up one of your many teams and send them to another state. 🤣That just might be what I want.
Im sick 🤢🤮
As a Packers fan I'm sad Rodgies is out. Love and Speedy recovery AR12
Jets D is great but also Josh Allen gifted those ints absolutely awful overrated qb
Leonard Floyd ex-Chicago Bear probably gave Aaron Rodgers the last hit he is ever going to take in the NFL. Just like Corey wootton DE for the Chicago Bears gave former Packers quarterback Brett Favre the last hit of his career.
Good news… you get Jordan love in 20 years though
At least the J E T S Jets Jets Jets still have their 2021 1st round pick... they could have traded away their 21, 22 and 23 first rounders to a conference rival for a 4th LMFAO
Are all Jet fans all psychotic??? Well, at least we know of one...eh, Richard?
People celebrating this because of politics are disgusting.
Jet's will be lucky if they can win 5 games this season. Ain't no way Wilson is taking them to the playoffs 🤣 Maybe see if Kap is available 🤣
And because of the curse saleh and jets should never again speak of the Super Bowl until we are at the Super Bowl don’t jinx it again next year
Yea the Jets might be cursed for real 😂😂
OMG
I'm so sorry Rich
Stop yelling Rich
“The Jets killed Carl.”  - Larry David
"We can't have nice things." - Every Jets Fan.
Next man up
Don't cry!
Damn man, I've been watching Rich a couple years now and I feel so bad for him :/
Rich, my hearts goes for you and all the Jets fans. It’s so unfortunate
Classiest melt down ever.
Imagine if the 49ers waited on Lance and traded him to the Jets to play with Wilson.
Just be smart enough to know when to retire , and that time is now .
Too soon to bring up Garrison Hearst? 😉
WOW  24 Years ago, Vinny Testaverde does the same thing.  Just WOW
What did the Jets do wrong? Simple, they hired a 40 year old quarterback not called Tom Brady.
Somehow, I found Rich losing it, very satisfying... mybad...😂 😂
Is that the same calve he had issues in training camp.
They should not have had Vinny as   honorable captain......very bad omen
What a shame
Rich you freaking killed me… axe in the chest, fake spike… lol. Man I love it. I sooooo take comfort in my crazy beaten down yet forever hopeful Jet fan brothers. Chin up chest out… Get well Aaron we need your leadership from the sidelines! We still have a Super Bowl to win!!! Go jets!!!
Karoon Rodgers Will be fine in a month or so.. hes gonna go see his doctor Joe rogan.. they know it all .. science it's trash ..they have all the answers to life
Get rid of turf fields. No team, no fan, and no franchise deserves this. DEMAND it. Absolutely terrible.
I even watched Hard Knocks!  And I'm a Cowboys fan.  I didn't watch Hard Knocks in 2021 when The Cowboys were on!  I hadn't watched it since 08!  Even I was excited!  What a shame. 🙁
I mean this whole situation is going to go down as stuff of Jets legend. Rich is going to be here in 20 years when Jordan Love is traded to the Jets just reliving the horror.
Wait…the caretaker dies???!!??  How about a spoiler alert, dude? 😉
This history lesson of a rant gave me CHILLS. The fact that Vinny was there last night is wild to me. I thought my chargers were cursed.
Honestly I feel bad for you Jets fans. I mean good lord you mfs just have terrible luck. Any superbowl implications died with Rodgers' Achilles tendon. 4 snaps in and you can kiss the post season goodbye. We all know the deal
I feel so bad for the Jets and their fans, how can that happen 4 snaps in. As a Niner fan in the championship game last year when everything happened I just could not believe it and yesterday I also could not believe it.
When was the last time Detroit went to a playoff game let alone win one? 1907? So the Lions don't want to hear it.
Delusional fantasizing, typical jets fan..jets are finished once rodgers went down !! Accept Reality
Rodgers will be back.   Guaranteed.   He’s not going out like that.
The Jets are still paying their debts for Joe Namath's guarantee.
its 9/11 all over again
Rich rich rich rich rich, tsk. Talk about unlucky bud
On top of all the hype , all the hopes of a great season for a talented Jet team it just cost the ownership $17.5 million per snap.😢😢😢
Dude you can tell that rich is actually on the brink from this lol.
Scatman Carruthers taking an axe to the chest after traveling two days to the Overlook Hotel is the perfect description of this Summer/Fall and the Jets.
The JETS Curse Started when MO LOUIS hit Bledsoe ....... Tell Me I'm Wrong?? !!   FACTS !!!       I am Not even a Rodgers Fan but even I had Hopes the Jets or Bills would Kick Kc in the SACK alot this year and Keep them from the SB !!!
Research shows a link between hydroxychloroquine and tendon rupture.
The back to the future sound when talking about 1999 gave me chills its so mint
Dang!!! Vinny jinxed Rodgers!!
Aaron will be back - 1000% sure of, and he will overcome this for 2024. Aaron will Not leave the NFL like this - PERIOD!!!!  How can anyone think the Greatest QB of all time will just hang things up, he won't.  Aaron will feel he OWES it to the JETS, NY FANS, and to the LEAGUE to come back and prove it. When Aaron sees and feels the support, then expect Aaron to wrk hard, like many other Greats.   If anyone can overcome this injury, Aaron can.  Now, let's let Aaron focus on surgery and recovery and finally - > Let's support Zach Wilson, because he is QB # 1  regardless wh the JETS bring in (Carsn W. etc.). I also see improvement in Zach and we saw some great plays he made so I would Not say the JETS Season is over, not at all. 7-9 Last year, but the JETS are overall better in all 3 areas and they got Hall and Cook, and Oline back....and # 1 Defense.....so PEEPS!!!! CALM DOWN!!! PATIENCE!!!!!  GO JETS!!!!
It's the #8 Jinks!
This experiment cost the jets a minimum of $18.75 million per play,………..just think how much a grass field would have cost them……?
As a Cowboys fan, I know a little about disappointing seasons, but that is nothing compared to being a Jets fan. Brutal.
Stop commmenting which team you like in your replies. No one cares.
This is a top notch segment. The best one in last 6 months since ARog was traded to Jets
Diehard fans of a franchise only know their own misery... and dang does it run deep. You can have this one, Rich.
Aaron earned $17.6 million per play while playing for the Jets...his career is over but he will gladly take the cash and run
Your boy Olbermann seems happy about it.
Elway had retired by the 99 season
I'm sorry, this video was almost perfect television except for the part where you downgrade the significance of Josh Allen's INTs. He literally gave the Jets the game. LITERALLY. He took the ball and repeatedly gave it to the Jets. Not once. Not twice. Not even thrice. But four times. Had he not, does anyone really think Zach Wilson would have compensated for it? He throws an egregious pick himself and was running for his life the majority of the time taking the snaps.
I feel for Rich, I’m not a Jets fan but I was really hyped to see Rodger’s on a new team and was hoping it would be more like a Tom Brady/ Payton Manning signing and not a Russell Wilson type of signing but this is just worse case scenario. Football would’ve been so much better this year with Rodgers playing.
At least his team didn't lose 40-0
Rodgers career has been cursed. Whatever happened on draft night, has followed him for his entire career.
Honestly horrible start tp football this year. Rogers out for the year, Allen was aweful, Burrow was aweful, Mahomes was ok. Lots of terrible primetime games. I was excited to watch Rogers with the Jets. Honestly massive blow to my enjoyment of the season.
Rodgers should do his own research and fix his acl
Philip Rivers, Drew Brees?
Feels like you got Aaron Rodgers a year too late.
It's awful, but I can't stop giggling. This is so horrible, and expressed so marvelously, that it's like Edgar Allan Poe. I feel guilty about enjoying this horrible event.
I predict we never see Rodgers play another down in the NFL.  I honestly hope I'm wrong about this...
Rich you should’ve known it was too good to be true, pats fan speaking
Rich, trully, my deepest condolences.  Edit: Godspeed recovery for AR and all Jets fans
This Packers fan is glad it happened this year and not last.
Copium
Horribly bad movie script that is.
Feel bad for the Jets fans. Not for Rodgers but this has got to suck for the fanbase.
Rich, you're such a Jets fan haha... Tom Brady is a part owner of the Raiders, he can't play for any other franchise. Jets are done, accept it... This is classic!
Grow up
With this I doubt we'll ever get to see Rodgers vs Mahomes
The Football Gods are Cruel Motherf&@kers.
I know how you feel. Every Bengals fan remembers the camera panning back to show Carson Palmer writhing on the ground two snaps into our first playoff game in 15 years. We waited 15 years for two plays.
How many more injuries do we need to see before ppl realize football as it exists now isnt a  game people are meant to play?    Funny how the average career length of an nfl player is 3 years while the averege rugby player can last over 10.
It's the Miami witch craft that was put on them it's the Cuban Santeria they can't fight it off.
Rich, There has to be an option out there, don’t lose hope!
I'm not a fan of Aaron Rodgers. I'm not a fan of the Jets. I am a fan of Rich Eisen. So watching the Jets last night all I could think of was Rich Eisen, and all Jets fans, feeling sick to their stomach. And I could hear the heart break in his voice a few times here. Rich, I hope the Jets can make something of this season for you.
You can have Tannehill us Titan fans don’t want him
Hey Rich, it was really 5 snaps if you count Rodgers' Achilles......
Tom Tupa was the punter, he shouldve mentioned it
How's Mike Greenberg doing? He alright this morning? Lol
NFL owners better stop being cheap and invest in grass fields or this will ruin more teams hopes and dreams in the future…
Rich, ur sidekicks are terrible lol
TALK TO EM RICH!! 🤣
Tear down Metlife. The Jets and Giants should be playing in NEW YORK. I've said it time and time again the meadowlands are cursed!  Also Joe Namath sold his soul to the devil to win the Super Bowl
May God bless to Rogers and Jets!
I feel terrible for mentioning that Rodgers will snap his achilles in game one. Wtf. Jets fans deserve better than to have their hopes dashed yet again.
A+ rant.
As a Packers fan, I'm sorry, Jets fans.  I was rooting for you guys in the AFC.  Rodgers wants another one though.  I truly believe he'll be back next year.
Are they ever gonna fix the fucking turf at Met-Life stadium?
Dolphins Fan here. I am sorry for Aaron, Jets Fans and Football fans alike. What a shame. Damn
Sorry Jets but Bills fans still have you beat in the bad luck category
Ask Broadway Joe what deal he made with the Devil for his (in?)famous guarantee. Y'all truly are  a tortured fanbase.
Poor Rich and all the other Jets fans out there, that's the way the football bounces. I wish I could tell you there's always next year but...This is The NFL.
Hey Rich   Can you please  tell the NFL”Change  your  turf field to grass field”, so we can  keep are favorite players healthy.
Was just sick watching the useless cut-block giving the defender free pass to cream Rodgers.   Rich: Let's hope we find out the truth about what really  happened with the blocking scheme.
What happened? The Jets put everything on black and then red came.
Ny Jets is like those poor family in the movie ‘The Amityville Horror’😰
Chad Pennington is my favorite player of all time. I became a Jets fan when they took him in the first round. He broke his wrist in the pre season and my heart with it. It’s been broken heart after broken heart since.
Gee Rich,...do you think all the trouble started back in 1999 when you attended the game?  And ever since Rich Eisen went to the Jets game they've been cursed!
Rich, the football gods or maybe Josh Allen, handed you a win last night. You should be happy.
Kaepernick's agent apparently has reached out to the Jets about his desire to make an NFL return per Jordan Schultz.  Yeah, that's going to happen.
Dude has valid points. Eisen is the coolest old guy in the room.
Wasn't a Jets fan with ARod  but I was rooting for them last night!! what a game!! Jets should've given this kid a chance in the first place instead of thinking AR was the answer to their problems!!
You wanted Rodgers, you got Rodgers. No sympathy for Jets fans.
I know the scene Scatman was in Miami with Miles Davis Bitches Brew artifacts on the wall he got his vision and went back to Colorado.
We should never allow ourselves to feel so desperate that we would even consider calling Tom Brady. C'mon. We are better than that.
Awful evening 😢
Rich you were right the Jets can't have nice things!!!
I'm in the denial stage I still can't believe it
I feel for you Rich,  jets fans don't deserve this much.
Bears fan here lol hahahaha ha Rodgers sucks and is old the jets suck for bringing fukkkk wit there hahaha
75 million two year guarantee without an offensive line…salary cap hell and back to the AFC basement
Back to the future sounds. That crack me up..😅🤣🤣 Now all jokes aside, Jets are curse man.
Trade for Minshew!
WOW! Vinny Testeverde... Daaaamn!!!
Rich calm down, Zach Wilson is going to take the Jets to the AFC Championship game this season
What a funny fake injury ..rodgers did a horrible job selling it too
Rich looks like a mad man and so upset and disappointed I understand his pain that same stadium took out my niners
Rodgers gets sacked because the O-line coach refuses to block the way Rodgers wants and insists on cut blocks depending on the called play? Really?  Note to NY coaching staff: if you have a QB that changes the plays depending on the defense, you need to change blocking the way the QB plays, otherwise, your rigid stubbornness will get the QB hurt.  It would seem Rodgers play was too advanced for the OL coach to adjust accordingly.
Actually 5 snaps.
I'm sure in time Joe Namath will pass on knowing he was the only legendary Jet's Super Bowl winning QB.
This situation reminds me of the Jets from the 1980's when they had a good defense led by Klacko but an average or bad QB.  Now in this day and age the Jets have a defense after the injury to Aaron Rodgers who is done playing serious football they are doomed for this good generation of defensive players to fail like the 1980th.
Come get Kirk Cousins. Please?
Wow, a Tom Tupa reference in 2023. The Jets are down bad today 😂 The Shining analogy is spot on though 😂😂😂😂
Why did the Jets follow up a 26 yard run with three straight pass plays anyway? Not only just three straight pass plays, but the first two incomplete with pressure on Rodgers, got a first on a holding call and then on first down run another pass play where Rodgers gets sacked and blows achilles. Maybe Achilles ends up rupturing on the next play or next series or next game anyway, but still interesting play call strategy by the Jets
Honestly though, how stupid is the Jets organization to not also solidify the o line? This was coming from a mile away and everyone saw it. Even if rodgers doesn’t get injured , he’s not doing what everyone thinks with that line. Let’s hope he sticks around to mentor Zach on the sideline
Football Gods want Namath dead...im convinced
Now that's a non sensical rant
Misery is right rich this is unbelievable
Rodgers is so good he doesn't even need to play too make us better
Giants fan here: The silver lining here is the giants are still a way bigger joker than the jets right now. As much as the situation sucks I think the Jets have a good future ahead. They have a great roster
WOW, that was a Great Analogy of the Shining Movie when The Skat Man takes a Axe to The Chest! WOW, you Jet Fans Are really going crazy and I guess I would also go crazy if it happened to my team, The Giants! As a Fan, I was shocked that my team did not score one point in their first game which was a total embarrassment but for Rogers to get injured and miss the entire season is a major catastrophe for Jet Fans! The Jets have a opportunity to sign a Veteran QB because several are available at this time and they can have Him on the sidelines if Wilson fails or they can start Him after He learns the system and either way, they should have a winning season because of their great defense!  Good Luck jet fans!
Damn that’s crazy Aaron Rodgers was this close 🤏to playing this year for the Jets😂
"4 snaps!" 😂 poor Rich
If someone hasn't made one already, I can already see someone making green and white T-shirts saying "four snaps" as a testament to Jet's misery.
Jets are the AFCs Vikings... the God's have some real curse set on the Jets & Vikes
Rich Eisen sounds like a pre-2004-ALCS Red Sox fan.
its a blessing... trust me. you weren't going to the Superbiowl with Aaron. Ask a Wisconsinite
Called it 😂😂..
As a Niners fan, I’m sick. Just sick we’re robbed of watching ARod with the jets this year. Gutted. All football fans should be.
That horrible Jets offensive line gave the defense free runs at the quarterback on 2 out of the first 4 plays before they got him hurt.
Rich get a massage to zach stop running backwards please
RE. 🐐.
Rich's reaction is so real. This is how I'm sure other Jets fans feel but don't have the talents to express.  I'm an Eagles fan so I can't relate as we have had successful teams. But as a 76ers fan I'm right there.  I actually feel bad for Jets fans. It's been 54 years. And it looks like perhaps a few years more. I see Rodgers retiring.
What the football gods want is...... another Wu-Tang double LP👐
The jets misery continues 😈😈🤣🤣
As a Bears fan I feel bad for Rich and other Jets fans. Thought they might go to the Superbowl this year you can kind of throw that out the window now
They need to sign Brisset
Been waiting since Rodgers 5 th snap as a Jet
As a Colts fan who lives in and from Indy, Aaron Rodgers injury felt like a bigger blow to me as a football fan thn the Colts loss l Did on Sunday and that stung too
As an Astros fan I understand.  Verlander pitched opening day 2020, tore his ucl. Didn't see him again til 2022. Sorry, I don't know anything about football. Except its extremely boring.
No other team gonna have 5 turnovers and a special teams touchdown in one game enjoy 1-16
Was that a Goonies sound effect?
I wish Aaron a speedy recovery, but I think it may be time to hang up the cleats. Coming back from that type of injury at your age will be double tough. It has been awesome watching you as your Hall of Fame career unfolded and your success in Green Bay. It is a shame you got injured as I know many Jets fans were excited to see you play. I am a Miami fan, so I cannot say I am not glad we will not have to face you twice this year, but I wish it was for other reasons. Retire and know you have had an incredible career.
is Zach Wilson old enough to drive
Rodgers will be traded to the Vikings next season, completing the cycle and satisfying the football gods so that the Jets curse will be lifted
as a bears fan, this makes me feel a tiny bit better.
The big, dumb, discarded Sega Dreamcast, aka, Met (no life) Stadium, is cursed.  Feel for you Jets fans, your squad is right there.  That D is for fuckin real.   Go NY.
"4 snaps in, axe in the chest!"  This was gold.
tails never fails, but you also have to keep your head in OT.
Sorta reminds you of how Tom Brady started.  Coming of the bench, after Bledsoe was injured.
Get natural grass, tf you guys doing with your million dollar assets?
sign tom brady for 50 million
Jets fans have endured as much misery and suffering as any sports fan should endure; this was just cruel, almost like a death in the family.  Sixteen games to go with Zach Wilson; hope the defense can keep the offenses from scoring.
The simulation is real.
At least you guys got a Lombardi trophy. 4 superbowl losses in a row and now sugar high josh Allen. Bills have it worst of any team
Rodgers seemed to lose a step the last couple years.
When I saw the Rodgers injury, I immediately wanted to see Rich Eisens reaction lol
I'm an Eagles fan since 1987 and so I suffered thirty years of those same repeated kicks in the nards until 2017. Maybe you'll get your chip someday too.
Trade for the Browns QB2.
Four snaps is wild
Knew this was gonna happen without knowing 🤫
When I first saw the injury the first thing I thought was I cant wait for Rich Eisen diatribe about the football gods and man he didnt disappoint
Is Bailey Zappe still available?
So, what your saying is that “a jet went down” on yesterday? September 11, 2023🤔🤔  Where have iSeen before?
Sorry Rich. All of us football fans were looking forward this yr for y'all
The second he was ruled out for the rest of the game I felt so bad for rich... so much hype and so much joy taken so quickly.
As a Dolphins fan, I hate not seeing 2 well oiled machines going at it twice a year. I hope Aaron comes back next year so Tua can give some payback. Love and well-thoughts to every fan and every team, from the 305 - may the next few months be healthy and happy for all.
Trade for Huntley from Ravens ASAP
Well the Seahawks Tanked they're not looking like there's a very good outlook. I went to Berkeley so I thought hey I'll join rich and be a Jets fan this season. I don't know I may be done with the NFL too much for me
I think Rich is talking as a Bills fan not a jets fan… “What do you want from us!?”
Tom Brady? Desperation.. 😳, Rich needs help…
It's hard to feel bad for an awful city like new york
It would have been better if it was ACL or a broken ankle. Achilles is career ending.
Damn as a miserable bills fan, I feel so bad for jets fans everywhere
Not a Jets or Rodgers fan but this is all around bad for the NFL. Was looking forward to seeing how the AFC played out with Rodgers and that defence
As a Packers fan who was glad to see him go, this is hilarious.
O-line sucks for any QB there.
I'm still in shock and disappointment. I can't wrap my brain around it. Great win last night. The team has heart.
I am so sorry for your loss.  It breaks my heart.  I am a Packer fan and I really had hoped things were going to improve for you.  Maybe it still will.  Aaron can help Zach and things may improve that way.  You might be surprised Zach is your future
Rich - if there is a positive outcome to this situation here it is....and YOU are the ambassador to champion this. PLEASE DO SO!!! Aaron has done EVERYTHING RIGHT since becoming a Jet. He is a NYC guy. He's been a mentor, a coach, a father figure to all the guys on the team, especially Zack. He's on the sideline calling plays in the preseason. If he now disappears all of that good will is GONE. Aaron needs to stay. He needs to be on the sidelines @ the Cowboy game. He needs to be the mentor, coach and father figure he set himself up to be -- NOW More than ever!!!! If he does that, the Jets probably win the division. If he doesn't you can probably kiss the season goodbye.
Arizona sports fan here. This is awful I am so hurt for Jets fans right now
No sir.. Josh allen gave away that win for godsakes
The real horror are the 40 year old QBs, who hang around forever, collect all the money, because the NFL protects them..  So much so, they don’t even realize anymore there’s risk in passing the football..
I think the fact the Jets won makes it even more painful because you got to see that Joe Douglas and Saleh built a REALLY DAMN GOOD team for Rodgers to come into and just like that....ooof.
1st I love you Rich. I got what i was expecting "I need therapy part 2" The answer to you question (what the gods want from us?) easy, the current owners to sell the team and the team move to NYC and not NJ.
I feel ur pain as a bills fan that was born in 1990 Rich
Brady saw that leaky jets Oline - he ain’t coming …
Dallas will give you Cooper Rush for a 1st round pick.
Most devastating injury in the history of the NFL, all things considered
Rodgers now becomes the qbs coach and is on his way to replacing Nathaniel Hackett as OC
Living 30 minutes away from Green Bay, we have had our ups and downs with the way we have reflected on Aaron’s switch to New York. That being said, personally, this is devastating to see him invest so much of his talent among the league of football fans who have fallen in love with this championship caliber roster. Genuinely, I offer my condolences to the Jets and their fan base. Hope to see A-rod uplifted soon to continue spreading his qb coaching to Zach and his talent to the Jets franchise. Trust me, any football fan is sad to see this happen.
Football gods, what do you want? Answer: misery  Why change if it's working
Jets cant ever have nice things. Sell the team start a franchise from scratch
I quit football
As a Steelers fan I feel for him. Saw my guys get dismantled first game of the regular season after sweeping preseason. This def takes the heat of us for the next week or two 😂
As a Cowboy fan I know your pain
Every day with Eisen and Greenberg is a view into what it’s like to be a Jets fan.  Tedious.
I’ve been a fan since 1969. I’m hurting.
lets stop referencing football gods please... youre getting the Real God angry dammit.
I am sad for Jets Fans. Signed Lions Fan.....
As a Vikings fan im not sad to see Rodgers sustain a season ending injury. The Jets should trade for Kirk, he'd be a huge upgrade from Wilson
As a Packers fan I will say I wish him a good recovery.....and for the Jets ill remind them that Rodgers has been an all time great talent that always fails. He did win a championship all those years ago, but I can tell you the man has been cursed ever since.
Bills fan here….we can understand and relate. Feeling awful for Jets fans this morning.
I like it... karma for being a diva
The day the Jets traded Namath to the Rams. They have been cursed.
As a Patriots fan ABSOLUTELY NO SYMPATHY. HATE THE JETS AND HATE MISS PREMADONNA MISS RODGERS
Way to make it all about you, Rich. Quit crying.
It reminds me of when Gordon Hayward broke his leg 6 minutes into his Celtics tenure. The sporting gods can be cruel.
Jets need to fix their field.
Thanks Rich 😂, as a Jets fan, this was needed.
Is this Matthew berrys cousin?
Remember in the movie little Nicky when Marino was asking the devil for another shot at the Super Bowl and Dan says “ you did it for Namath”…..yea now I’m really starting to think Namath sold the jets to the devil for one ring and now we are living in hell
Let's make it about Aaron's energy and optimistic energy vs. injury because as much as this sucks it has to be...it is.  Maybe a good season...let's hope.  I'm busted today.
The jets ain’t going to no Super Bowl. Now the jets fans can shut up with all that hype
My die hard eagles fan and it hurt me for Aaron to get that type injury  it bothered me so much could not sleep feel awful for jets fans the jets team and Aron awful can we please get rid of turf protection for your players
They should have had Tom Tupa before the game.
Jet's stadium haunted by the ribs of Mike White
Notice how Tom Brady never was really injured by sacks?  First he had an internal clock that got the ball out of his hands.  Two:  if he was sacked, he just let it happen not putting too much pressure on himself to escape.   These things greatly reduce the potential for injuries.  Josh Mcdaniels is going to get hurt.  He thinks he’s a running back.
Rich......listen to Mudvayne "Dull boy".
Honestly this is one of the biggest tragedies of all time in sports. After all the talk and hype. All the hope and even for those of us who are not Rodgers or Jets fans.   I was excited to see how this new fit would go and the Jets be good. And for it to be 4 snaps? And end? Is absolutely absurd 💀
Rough league, accidents happens..BUT bad things often happens to bad franchises, let’s say one that finally got an mvp QB and didn’t invest in OL to protect him… just saying.. think about it.. what was the first thing Bucs did for Tom … traded up and drafted for OL…Cowboys is gonna kill that kid next week having these fool to protect him.
Jets have no history 😒
Someone get Rich a valium! The dude is going to blow a gasket.
Imagine having a seasons worth of play schemes, planned for a top 5 qb EVER,  then having to dumb it down for Zack. All about coaching now
Already!? Lol
The shining comparison has me truly concerned for RE
I'm keeping receipts of all these fake fans an I'm letting it RIP when Zach Wilson is leading us to the playoffs an Yall are choking him down on your knees
Scatman Cruthers… you mean Groundskeeper Willie in the Shinning
As a chiefs fan I’m so sad to see him get hurt especially since it could be the last chance at Rodgers-Mahomes
Duane Brown was horrendous all night.  I've been screaming about putting Becton at LT since camp.  Insane how bad he was.  Becton is a top 3 LT.  Oh, and thanks Woody, you jerkoff for turf, cheap fuq.
If you thought Aaron Rodgers was going to be your savior you haven't been paying attention to his career for the last few years. An aging legend in the twilight of his career? This may be a blessing in disguise.
Does Aaron even play again?? That's a tuff injury for a YOUNG player to come back from, gezz Rogers is 40.... Poor Jets fans
WE all KNOW NOW RODGERS really only has 2 SEASONS left in HIM if   soooo gl NY lmao watch this injury will RETIRE him
Maybe ARod is the Obi-wan not the Luke Skywalker in this story.
Try being a lifelong Cubs fan. Jets fans get no pity from Cubs fans.
Likely the career is over. Tough injury to come back from in your 20s. The man will be 40. Likely the Jets will be up and down this season. Their defense is for real but still not convinced on Zach Wilson. Also a Lions fan, which we've had our share of ugly moments.
There's nothing more entertaining than watching an overweening Jets fan eat crow. 🙂  The Jets are still good, esp., with Hall and Cook and the Packers receving corps. Good luck to them.
Go get Kalpernic it's time !!! Zach Wilson is not gonna cut it ! This Jets defense deserves a superbowl!
Eisen: "Call Tom Brady".....heresy. To the shadow realm you go.
Unfortunately its going to take more than WILSON to get the Jets into playoffs
ITS definitely not VINNY's fault..............   ITS YOUR PUTRID O LINE.
Hard Knocks jinx has visited Rodgers....
Rodgers' career is over
Rich do you need a hug?
I’m a Seahawks 12.  And I’ve never really been an AR fan, although I don’t deny his talent.  But I SERIOUSLY feel for the whole Jets fan base.  (And for AR).  I’m so sorry.  Hope somehow Zach W can be enough.  Saleh is a rock star.
You got here because 2 sorry a** tackles didn’t want to block for an mvp!
The answer to the jets  problem is cam newton.
Come on Rich....Jets won the big one in 68/69....as a Pats/Sox fan, you got at least another 25/30 years to go...Keep your head up big guy
Gotta feel for the Jets Nation. You think your renting a G-Wagon, and end up driving that Toyota Minivan.  Gezzz. Let's go Zack Wilson.. ??? I reckon😂😂😂
I can feel the pain in Rich's voice so sad
Sorry for your loss Rich
Im sorry Rich
Sell the team woody
Jets, Mets, Knicks, Islanders. I've never seen anything like it. Whenever I watch other games they run smoothly. No random drama or insanity happening on the playing field. It happens every single time with my teams. Whether it be a freak injury to the best player or a miraculous comeback/blunder. 1986 was the last championship one of my teams have won. I think I'm cursed at this point.
This is the most hilarious thing to happen to the Jets nation in a LONG time. I hate it for Rodgers, but love seeing the Jets fans react to this news. It's the most Jets thing I've ever seen.
This is definitely worse then drafting Mark Sanchez
Kerby Joseph STILL has the last reception of a pass by Aaron Rodgers. Well, interception, but you know what i mean. Odd if thats a wrap on career.
I'm not laughing about ur QB getting hurt,,,but Rich is comical...he's ready to pay the football gods
Well I was never a Rodgers "fan" but seeing anyone go out like that with what might be the end of his career is horrible. He seemed like he was embracing his role as the elder team leader and genuinely seemed happy getting out of GB.   I actually turned off the game after that expecting a blow out, plus having to get up early. Looks like I missed some action.  I remember Parcels with the Jets but I totally forgot how Vinny went out.
After this the Jets should learn about purchasing used products from Green Bay by now but they keep falling for it smdh
This is some of Rich's BEST material I've ever heard.
I love rich eisen and I’m a bengals fan so I know the struggle
LMAO this is what ya get for not taking the VAXX lmao covid toe WON lmao well JETS why dont ya give SANCHEZ a call
Rich can take solace in the fact that his team wasn’t going anywhere with a healthy Rodgers.
I'm sorry but the jets still beat the bills on national TV with Zach..as a dolphins fan I am more scared of the jets then anyone else no matter who the jets have for qb
Im a Bills fan and I say both teams lost yesterday. The Bills the game (well deserved L) and the jets possibly the season. The most Bills Jets thing of all time. Our fan bases cant catch a dam break.  I feel bad for jets fans and Aaron. they did not deserve that. This season is shitty. I wish the best for AROD
I think this is hilarious.  We got AR, we're going to the SB.  AR will be fine on some beach recouping.  And hey, the Jets won the game.
He would make a great QB coach.
I'll never forget Parcells' face when Vinny went down.  Unfortunately, it's a debt to the FB Gods who are still collecting for The Guarantee.
That punt return was absolutely electric. One of the best moments in sports a walk off HR, buzzer beater for the win, goal in Playoff OT in hockey, and special teams plays in the NFL. Let alone a walk of PR for a TD. Great game legendary finish.
The Gods probably just want you to suffer...
Its so cruel. I cant believe that happened. Its like he flew too close to the sun and got struck down maliciously
This was just great
Jets bad luck is on another level
Yo, try to be a Browns fan or a lion's fan  Browns fired Bill, He quit on you on a napkin. However, Jets have won a  Super Bowl congratulations on that it's so hard
As a dolphins fan I would like to say   That honestly sucks man. I was really looking forward to those matchups. Hope he gets well soon.
Turf fields??
As much as it sucks, if Aaron Rodgers was already leaning towards retirement last offseason, I don’t see him coming back next year. Maybe that’s how it should be, he seems like he’s got a life he enjoys outside of football and we’ve already seen on countless occasions players pushing longer than they need to go. He’s my favorite player of all time, so it’s not easy to say, but I think it’s time.
When does Carson Wentz get signed ? 😂 seriously though Jets have shocking luck
The real Aaron Rodgers was the friends we made along the way
I always said joe namath sold his soul to Devil guaranting victory in super bowl as 16pt underdogs lol..im a huge jets fan n it dont get worse then this
One of the best rants I've ever heard.  Kudos.  The Jets end another career.
I just can’t help but think of all the stress and frustration and seeking Aaron went through trying to decide if he wants to play football anymore. All that mental effort into searching inside and deciding if he wants to do this. All of that, for absolutely nothing. One of the craziest things I’ve ever seen
Yea but you completely forgot the Namath and Eubank years and the reason Namath walks on a cane
Wilson’s time to shine if he takes it!
Delicious Jet tears😭🤣
I think Carrol Rosenbloom, Don Shula, and Al Davis put a curse on the Jets over Super Bowl 3. This tops the Bobby Layne curse. The unyielding pain of the Red Sox and the long suffering Cubs. An unfair tragedy and a brutal existence that shadows the Jets. Its not right.
A Jets fan whining is like a dude with a gun that he points at his foot complaining that he was shot in the big toe. YOu don't have to be a fan of that moribund, useless franchise. You're doing it to yourself.
9/11 conspiracy theorist, gets  hurt for the 5th out of the last 7 seasons, gets hurt on 9/11..playing for a team in NY called the Jets... after carrying an American flag into the field.
He should've gotten the jab
Nerd analogy du jour: If the Jets were the Fellowship, Gandalf would’ve fallen into Khazad-dûm four steps outta Rivendell.
It's over Already?
Give Dallas a first round for Trey Lance ....
There's really no way to sugar-coat this... but I don't get why people think the sky is falling. Yes Rodgers has a lot of credit to his name, but he's still a 39 year old quarterback.
I guess Jets fans have to cancel there ticker tape plans
I’m sorry but if I were a jets fan, THIS would be the last straw. I’d just watch the games and stop claiming a team. 4 plays in? I was there when Favre got hurt, and this was way worse.  I hope they win it all now. THAT’D be dope!!
I legit feel bad for Jets fans
4 snaps you say? 5 counting the achilles.
I don't even listen to this, but just the way this guy was talking, this is the most passionate he's been about something
all time rant!
FYI….The Houston Oilers STILL have more AFL/AFC East divisional titles the Jest do!!!!!
Who gives a Flying F about Aaron Rodgers? Better think about climate change. High gas prices and mortgage rates..stuff more important..
Even as a fin fan I didn't even wanna see this  sorry for Rodgers and jets fans season ain't over you never know what could happen look at warner and Brady outta nowhere still got a great d
This is part of the reason I wanted Rodgers gone from GB years ago…before the last contract extension we gave him. Lots of playoff appearances, not a lot of Super Bowls…he was overpaid for the last couple years here, and I knew we could achieve the same results with a cheaper QB.  Edit: To be clear, I still wish Rodgers a speedy recovery and you hate to see someone get injured…but it feels good knowing that Love will finish the season with a better QB rating lol.
Hello darkness my old friend…
As a 9er fan I know how it hurts when guys go down to injury. Best wishes to Rodgers and Jets fans. ❤
Damn dude AR is now made of glass... all this hype all the hardknocks only to get hardknocked in 4 plays and now out for a season.
lol I agree with you Rich, Jets should hella call Brady and give him half the team to play for them.
You guys can thank artificial turf for that injury...no give
Karma from GB??
Rich is going full-on McCafee.
this guy seems a little too happy about this injury
Maybe this is a blessing in disguise? The Gods are not crazy.Pain inflicting yes...crazy no.
The Jets have the worst luck of all NFL teams
It’s called Karma. Karma has been stalking Rodgers since his “I’m immunized” BS  during COVID.
Man, who could have seen an old border line retired qb would get injured on a terrible terfed field with a terrible O-line vs a great defense. Who could have seen something like this happening?
I was waiting for Rich’s reaction to this…. Strangely I’m rooting for Zach Wilson idk why but wtf we may have seen the last of A-Rod damn
J.E.T.S. SUCK SUCK SUCK
NYers always get punched in the face whether its sports or the loser democrats they elect. I was rooting for Rodgers and the Jets this sucks
I’m convinced the football god hate the Jets, nobody can tell me different 🤦🏾‍♂️
Rich sounds LEGIT pissed!😅
And 2 of those 4 snaps Rodgers had to run for his life because of the Jets' well earned suspect pass protection.
don't play Rodgers in the preseason because he might get injured.
Any injury in the NFL is terrible.  Man that Jets D is badass tho.
Rich ive got 3 cities to tell you.Houston(includes the Oilers),Detorit and Cleveland not 1 superbowl apperance.
What Rich doesn’t realize, they would’ve done worse with Rodgers in.  Ask a Packer’s fan.
Love to watch jets fans suffer but especially this dope.
Hire the great Tom Brady for one season 🙏🏻
I’d be curious to hear Adam Sandlers thoughts on the events of last night and his reaction to Aaron going down.
Pro sports.  These people are emotionally connected to a billionaire’s business..... imagine if people bought clothes covered with food or drink companies and got all excited when executives changed positions.... it’s weird.  Now imagine these food companies doing things that are bad for business or not caring to make their business better and people STILL having an emotional connection. This is hilarious.
Yeah I feel bad for jets fan's such a great defense and overall good team but without Rodgers I don't have much hope for you guys cause your quarterback looks horrible
Wait till they sign Wentz and you really see how low things can go.
And if you add VInny's and Arron's numbers...it equals 24!!!! OMG.. 24 years! It's the 24 Curse!!!
I'm a diehard Dolfan. After the Jets reeled in ARod, my first thought was: they need a good backup QB. The Dolphins quickly scooped up Mike White, so imo, the Jets season is pretty much over. Sad
What does God want from you? A field that doesn’t crave flesh.
I do feel for Jets fans. Watching football is one of my favorite things in the world. I don't know if I could stay a fan if my team disappointed me year after year for my whole life. My brother in law is from NY, and he actually gave up on football in his 20s. He was a big fan and he just gave up, spends his Sundays doing something else.  It was sad when I talked to him about it, he said it just wasn't fun or enjoyable anymore, to lose all hope for the playoffs by week 4 or 5 each season
I shed a little tear😢 and instantly thought of you when I saw Rogers go down.
That shining analogy was epic
Sucks for Rogers but please   Rich. Everyone else and half of NYC says FTJ!
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
How do I end up supporting the cursed teams. First Manchester United get injured to hell and back and now the Jets lose Rodgers.
Aaron Rodgers is my favorite. I have his Green Bay jerseys and his New York Jets jerseys. This is incredibly sad. I hope A-Rod heals very well and returns to the sidelines as soon as possible. He has given this Packers' fan so much joy, which is what I was looking forward to with his time with the Jets. Praying for you, Aaron! It was an amazing and gritty win for the New York Jets last night.
STL RAMS: Trent Green/Kurt Warner, 1999-2000. Ended with a SB win.
Mahomes is now NEVER going to get to go H2H with Rodgers.
Crazy to see the hate and bitterness towards Rodgers. And it mainly has to do with the vaxx
Yeah that or Matt Lienart get Collarbone broken after coming back from injury.
zach wilson isn't ready. I know that for sure. He looks scared every time he's out there. Long Season for the JETS.
Bears fan...at least you had a quarterback for 4 snaps.
Skee Yee On to Cincinnati In Zak we trust  Lessfn GO
That's the sound of the world's most over inflated balloon bursting. Well, it was fun while it lasted.......all four snaps of it. ("I will stop there....")  And Rich, before you go off too much about how great the rest of the Jets are (and talented they are), just remember their "Secret Weapon".....Josh Allen and his 4 interceptions. If you have a couple thimbles of talent on your team (which the Jets do have), if the opposing QB is playing "pitch and catch" with your defense you're going to have a solid chance to win. So while you're putting together that "Get Well Soon?" card for your newly retired Messiah, don't forget to send a Thank You card to Mr. Allen.
Soooo... Packers won the trade, right 😂
I'm not a Jets fan but Holy Cow is this tragic.   I feel bad for everyone involved from Roger's,  his Jets teammates, management,  fans of course and even the league as this storyline was a great one to watch.  Well Jets fans as a Rams fan since 1975 this has rge feeling of the Rams 1999 season.  Don't lose hope your greatest storyline might just about to be written.
1999 sucked but at least i was 24 in 1999  this is worse and im old man now 🤣
Man rich i feel so bad for you!! Welcome to the club sir. Im a Gang member! NINERS!!!!!!! So i feel your pain sir. I really do.
Props to the production crew.  Back to the future music is amazing.
Who cares. Bye Rodgers
Something's weird. Zach does not seem like himself, especially when he came in the game.
Well I mean it is the jets...
Aaron Rodgers will retire. No point in rehabbing when you only planned on playing two years. So sad he got hurt that quickly.   PS: Zach Wilson is complete trash, also, so sad. I was routing for the Jets, their defense played all out.
Don't Forget Greeny!!!!! Even as a Diehard Chicago Bears Fan & I really Don't like Aaron Rodgers, it sucks a Football fan that Jets fans have to endure this 😔😔😔
_Hubris, ate!_
our Jets are cursed
Rogers is horrible but imagine being a diehard Angels fan who SUCK with not one but two of the greatest players of ALL TIME🙄
As a Dolphins fan I'm laughing at Rich.  All we've heard from him for the last several weeks is how the Jets will be serious SB contenders.  For four plays they were.  Feel sorry for Aaron and hope for  complete recovery for next season.
THATS how you take a victory?  eeek! You are cursed Rich, not the Jets.
Breaking. Tom Brady is now a Jet
It's to laugh at guys like Eisen and Mike Greenberg, the egomaniacal New Yorkers who went to Northwestern and launched their lucrative sports careers, still pathetically obsessed with the Jets and expending pointless hours bemoaning the team's fate. Awful, boring stuff. We saw the game, Rich.
As an Eagles fan, I generally don't have much love for anything having to do with NY sports teams, but I have to admit, I feel really bad for Jets fans right now. It's truly heartbreaking.  Hopefully Rodgers will get healthy again and the Jets can still be competitive without him.  This was really a tough blow.
Every time something happens with the Jets i wonder, what does Larry David think?
I think the Football gods are still collecting payments from the 1st superbowl
😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
Rich saying "I'm not rational right now" and the look he gives to the camera is absolute gold.
I'm sure it's all just a huge coincidence
Ummm, this is NOT a curse or the O-lines fault. This is what happens when you put your faith in a 39yr old, immunized, dope head (by his own admission) who doesn't want to play anymore. Other people could see this coming, I'm shocked you were expecting more than Covid-Toe could give. (ITS NOT VINNY'S FAULT!)
Jetts gonna Jett
I am going to be the only guy to say : perhaps the football gods have something in store for the worthless human who booed Zach Wilson relentlessly last season.  This could be Wilson's wakeup call.  I am of the mind that all he really needed was a jolt like this to mature him.  The talent is definitely there, the fundamentals have been improved.  Now, can he just process the game a little more smoothly by calming his mind?   Who better than Rodgers to steel his nerves? I am always reminded of Steve Young going nowhere with a sinking Bucs team, then meeting Montana and reviving his career all the way to the HOF.
Rich knows how to put things so poetically! This is indeed some crazy stuff. Sorry for the jets. At least he is a loyal fan.
I tell u man. I really feel for Jets fan. I am a Ravens fan and I was exited for Jets this year. But this is just ridiculous. Get well soon Aaron. Unbelievable!!!!
49ers QB ghost from last year, turned out good for them.
Try being a raiders fan
😵He could just forget science as usual, disregard what the MRI says and gulp down some horse meds to fix his achelies - all while comparing his struggles to Martin Luther King jr. Ugh.
As a Bengals fan I know this feeling all too well
I'm a Bears fan. We're in the same boat because Fields is a complete bust!
Wait? R u seriously saying saleh is a good coach and Wilson is good?  Yall new yorkers still so delusional i see. Dude...Allen fumbled once...threw 4 ints. Almost any decent performance and yall are getting blown out.
Maybe if he got COVID this wouldn't have happened ?
Love The Shining reference. I thought if Obi Wan Kenobi wincing & saying he felt like there was a great disturbance in the force as Alderan was destroyed by the Death Star.
Well hopefully Zach picked up on somethings from Aaron during camp so he can show he improved. Just hurtful what happened to the team and Aaron. Sucks for the packers too losing out on that 1st round pick. Everyone loses something from this injury, just sad.
I blame Rich....
Rich take it easy bro we suffered enough don’t disturb the Bone let’s bury our dead. Tomorrow is a new day come on. You sound on the edge it’s ok accept winning. I’m ok with that you should be too. I know 1969…………. Is it possible that we could do it again in this lifetime?   We may be that good to do so. Peace my brother
Football gods about to bless us with a Cowboys’ superbowl baby
Maybe New York Jets/Giants will finally get rid of the damn Turf!  players safety first? Turf shouldn't be allowed in the NFL
F the football gods
😂 I stand with Rich
Lions fan from the early 70s here.  Man, oh man, do I feel bad for Jets fans.  As much as I rejoiced in the Lions win over you last year, I am deeply sorry for you now.  I have lived in some dark places of incredible disappointment but Aaron going down is just brutal.
I laughed so fu**in hard. Got saved by a punt reciever too 😂
Dude…there was some pain in that “4 snaps”. I feel for y’all, Rich
This is soooo JETS !!
Don’t worry, they didn’t leave your city like STL.
You can start by getting a better quality field
Rogers had 5 snaps.4 from his center and one from achilles.
That QB has zero! Confidence.
I”m actually glad this happened…. Let’s use next year’s number 1 draft pick to make a package and trade up for the next great QB, and do it right!
The most Jets thing ever.
😅🤣😂😆😃😄
Actually the most cursed team in the history of the NFL, the odds of this are astronomical
...why do you build me up /  Buttercup, Baby / Just to let me down?
20 yrs? Who was gonna give u the other 18-19?😂 def not Wilson
Oh come on it's not like everyone didn't see that coming it's the Jets and everyone knows they can't have nice stuff because it would make Rich Eisen happy and we can't have that.
Sorry NPCs...  Good luck finding a new MVP QB with a conflated QBR to add to your spank-bank.
That sounded like a different Zach. Humbled? Grown up maybe? Understands what greatness really looks like now and he wasn't it?
As a 49ers fan, maybe he'll lead you to a SB next year ala Jimmy G.
In 2020, five San Francisco 49ers players suffered lower-body injuries in a game at MetLife against the Jets, and the injuries to defensive linemen Nick Bosa and Solomon Thomas were season-ending.
Sorry to burst the bubble, but I don't think Tommy Brady can join a team other than the Raiders, since he has part ownership in them. And he might not even be able to join them, who knows.
Aaron Rodgers wasn't the answer to the Jets woes anyway, and blowing all that money on a guy that should have retired was a bad idea. Now what?
Unfortunately jets are still the jets incredible
Kicker made a business decision on that tackle in OT 😂
Rich we are cursed I had to take a week off work because of the pain
Ironic this story starts in 1999 because that's when the Browns came back and I'm sorry but nobody has had more terrible luck than them. Not just at the QB position but the whole damn team. I wish some of those qb's had only taken four snaps instead of ruining half a season before the next guy in line gets to take over the awfulness. I sympathize with Jets fans but let's keep it in reality
As a bears fan we know your pain
aroon rodgers also said, “There’s no way (prump) lost the election, because there aren’t enough idiots to have elected Joe Biden.” Jets vs GB Super Bowl!!!
I was waiting for this all day
MetLife stadium is cursed. I watched the Giants so much down the field about the score and everything just started going downhill like someone who was in the stands putting voodoo on them. That voodoo was still in the stadium and the New York Jets came to town and we seen what that voodoo did and  4 snaps
I think,  we all love rich ....but hes been gushing over  and picking BRADY for 20yrs .... he's a jet ...but hes celebrated more than suffered... ❤love ya rich
We couldn’t even get 1 game 😢
I genuinely feel bad for jets fans.
As a life long jers fan i expect this.. period
4....snaps......
Jets should trade for Winston
Four snaps and a tear
As a Redskins fan, I feel your pain Jets fans, and Rich. I had a similar feeling 2 years ago when Fitzpatrick was injured, though he was never Rodgers, and the rest of the team wasn’t as capable as the rest of the Jets seem to be. Nonetheless, Rich’s entire rant felt like my own. Why do the “football Gods” hate Jets and Redskins fans?
Learned nothing. Quit playing sloppy seconds to the Packers.
If they didn't play in cleats he'd have been fine
Poor Rich!
Imagine Zach Wilson sitting behind Aaron & Tom over the next 2-3 years
As a Raider fan. I felt this
Way too much Irony last night. Wilson ends up playing the best game of his career. Jets defense takes over game. Jets Win!  Jets Win  .. Good Night!
First of all, Try being a Falcons Fan! Then you can experience real misery. Jets fans have a long way to fall-suffer still.  ZERO SB wins to date for us life long falcons fan. Also, Rich, Seriously? Championship defense in 1 game? You know as well as all fans do this league is "What have you done for me lately?"  It is tragic I agree. Rogers being done for the season and not a spring chicken. That is for sure. But listening to you I can sympathize and also say it could be a lot worse.  Hang in there.  Both our fav teams are 1-0.    It is  a start! LOL
Aaron is going to retire. This is it for him
Get one of those holistic doctors to take a look at it, he'll be back by Sunday
I so feel this way!
Hard knocks is a jinx
That's what turf does, man. I can't believe Aaron didn't consider the fact that he'll be playing most of his games on that nasty MetLife turf.
The risk you assume when you pay a Geriatric QB.
Who would have thought: Josh Allen would complete more passes to the Jets than Aaron Rodgers would this year.
Time for some ayahuasca sessions
Hilarious 😂
it's pretty clear they sacrificed the Ram ( i.e. goat) to win the Super Bowl.
Rich is pissed bro, I feel so bad for jets fan mannn and I’m a bears fan😢
Looks good on you Rich Serves you right for trashing Denver n Russ all last year Looks like that coach Hackett in karma screwed you toi. That man is literal cancer to a team. Your idiots for hiring him…lol That n the jets suck n will always suck  Today is a great day Laughing at you😂😂😂😂😂😂
He was washed up anyway…
4 plays in and I instantly thought "I can't miss Rich Eisen tomorrow"
Joe Namath sold his soul for a ring and a gold jacket in exchange for an eternity of Jets futility...
Saints fan here, I'm so devastated for Aaron , Jets fans and for us football fans in general. And I thought the Saints always get cursed but this takes the cake.
It ain't easy being Green. smh
The injury to Aaron Rodgers is the biggest tragedy to ever happen to New York in the month of September.
What happens if new QB goes 13-4 this year, does Aaron still take over the team next year?
I was actually impressed with the way Zach Wilson zipped in bullet passes last night
the packers top brass are smiling now
We have one of the top 3 defensive units in the NFL and it doesn’t matter
Do you remember the Shining  .. lol
The Jet's need a veteran QB maybe some. Fitz magic 🧙‍♂️🤔
He reference Scat "Man" Crothers from the Shining...I laughed out loud. All the way from Florida to take an Axe in the chest😂😂
Not a Jets fan or Rogers fan. I don’t dislike then, I’m just saying they not my team. Sorry Jets fans and A-Rod this sht is fck up!!!
LoL. I love this. I felt the pain.
I feel for Rich and Greeny
Great episode!!!!  That would be cool if Tom Brady came
Thank you for this rant.  As a native New Jerseyan and lifelong Jets fan, your rant was everything I was feeling,
lol at the "Back to the Future" audio cue
Rich gotta be on suicide watch
technically it was five snaps four plays and one Achilles tendon. my condolences to Aaron and the Jets fanbase..
I'm only saying this to ease your pain.   With that O line it was gonna be a separated shoulder, concussion,  collar bone, or any other  impact injury to an old man   This way, it was taken care of right away, and this off-season, the front office can do something about that O line.
😂😂😂😂😂
Love ya Rich!
Hello from Pakistan - saw it live early, early this morning and the first person thought of was poor Rich Eisen 😳
How bout that tripping no-call at the end of the punt return , even the resident ref. In the booth called it out on air ?
As a Jets fan, go trade for Jacoby Brissett. They can win a Super Bowl with an average QB. He’d be perfect.
Tom Brady should be getting a phone call from the Jets at this point honestly. Slot him in… hopefully his achilles holds up… championship team.
lions fan here. Anyone know who his last completion was too.? Ohh and. RODGERS DAHN!!!
Of course it a terrible event and one hopes that any athlete gets to leave a sport on his/her own terms however often that is dictated by the injuries and time will tell. The storyline is now about about Zac Wilson . If he plays well the team has the talent to make the playoffs and he should be helped by the improvement to the running game and the additional experienced wide receivers. Furthermore , if does well and Rogers looks to be on the path to successful recovery then the Jets stand to get a much better return for him in a trade . If he does not play well and Rogers recovery is not good or has to extend in the next season then the Jets will face some difficult decisions. Not a Bengals fan but I actually am more concerned at the health of Burrows because it is early in his career .  I feel the same about Tua.
It's Maga Zach time!!!!   Enjoy jets fans
Rich I feel your pain. But Jets fans don’t have it as bad as Vikings fans. I’m 38 years old and never seen my team play in a Super Bowl
It's not as bad as Brett Favre sending D pics to Ms Sterger 🤷‍♂🥒🤦‍♂
15:29 let's start by getting that horrible artificial turf removed and replaced with some real grass
Poor Rich and poor JetsNation
Just brutal man. I was gutted for Eisen. Jets have a great D, but no QB.
Astroturf. Man. Maybe it's time to get rid of that stuff Jets? If you want your players to have achilles tendons intact.
Only Minshew or Streveler can save the Jets. Really I think Saleh is terrible he totally misused his timeouts at the end of the first half then called timeouts to let the Bills rest when they were weather D out. Hackett yanks Hall after 83 yds run?
Too funny 😂 😂😂!
In 2023 why would any pro sports team with a stadium still use artificial turf ? Why ? Its soooooo fucking embarrassing
What being a Jets fan does to a mf 🤣
Aaron's karma has come home to roost. He was good. Was.
You think Tom wants to play behind that offensive line?
At least the Jets have won one Super Bowel, being Chargers fan is hard as well.
Weird how NY football fans are so sad and pathetic when their baseball fans are so mad and douchy.
go dolphins
Stop bitching and throw your support behind your QB.
Rich my man! I’m in pain! 😢😭🥺
Poor Rich he can’t win.
Sorry @RichEisen.  As a life long Lions fan.  I can relate. You have a free ticket on our band wagon this year!
You can tell he is truly upset and hurt because hes a jets fan. I feel this pain because im a lifetime browns fan...but man.. this is horrible.  The hype..the expectations..all 2 go poof in 4 plays. As a fan im surprised he isnt crying while doing this show r.n😢.
I thought we had a qb injury problem in San Francisco. Sorry Jets and well wishes for Rodgers
Bet your wishing they made a real effort to get Carr rather than the old man Rodgers.  Looks like the Saints will get the last laugh on the Jets and Raiders. WHO DAT !!!!!
Um..as it was glossed over by his bias for the Jets….  Bills turnover’s!!!
This entire off-season, I had this uneasy feeling, yet everyone was so optimistic. The offensive line drives your success, it allows your passing and running game to thrive. Without that wall being solid, whi cares how good your QB is.
Aaron already handed the keys over to Love already..what more do you want 😂
As a Lions fan I feel your pain. In my 36 years of life I've had 2-3 season where we actually had a good team to root for. I'm not getting ahead of myself yet. OnePride!
I think all football fans are crushed with this because we were waiting to see how the jets would look this year with Rodgers I’m not a jet fan and I was disgusted with the injury
Rich Eisen & Greeny were the first people I thought about last night lol. This is rough. Damn. Sorry Jets fans 😔Got that W tho! Good luck this year  - 9ers Fan
We got Breece hall, looking like Breece Hall, Dalvin Cook, looking like Dalvin Cook we got Gibson in the special teams we got Garrett, Wilson, Lazard, making plays !  We got Reed & Sauce , The Williams Brothers  Q& Q  if we don’t fall apart and keep it together who knows what could happen I got no choice but to think like that because trust me, I’m just like you right now stressed all the way out I sat on my couch after the game for about half an hour before I even moved
Just got a cadaver Achilles tendon in my knee at VA Richmond.
I can’t think of a bigger wahmp wahhh in sports. All the hype. The build up. That one receiver retiring. The question is that pick situation. The Packer’s pick from the Jets is based on how much Rodgers played this year.
Brilliant!!!!❤
I really wanted the jets to work out. Colts fan but this made me so sad for true team and it’s fans
He was the chef.
Vinny T lol wow. That sidearm was so surprising.  Sorry Rich. Feel for you guys. Was really looking to see what Rodgers could do.
You shouldn’t have trash talked his character and personal values so much. He’s a solid dude that loves to ball and is probably in more anguish than we can imagine. Not once did I hear this guy say he feels bad for the man, I get it though tough day sorry jets fans
Itll be crazy if jets still make the playoffs like a stl rams 1999 situation lol
😅😅😅😅😅😅
They should of held on White.  That kid can ball.
Raven’s fan here and I’m so sorry not only for Jets fans, but for fans of football itself. I know what injuries can do to a championship calibre roster but that turf needs to be addressed ASAP! God Bless AR and the Jets. 🙏🏻🙏🏻 I was so looking forward to seeing AR lead the Jets to the playoffs and beyond! 😢😢😢
The entire world can't make enough cheese for your WHINE. sob sob sniff sniff.
You never needed Rodgers, this kids got it.  Wait and see
That was decades worth of manic rant. Let it all out. I feel it.
September 11 is not a good time for New York
Fantastic Take
I’m not even a Jets fan and I was looking forward to following them this year. Brutal. They might make the playoffs but yeah their season is over Wilson doesn’t have it in him to compete in January with the horses in the AFC. Absolutely stacked conference, heck their division is stacked. We will trade you Brissett for that first you got back 🙂
I blame Vinny Testaverde, he brought his injury to that stadium last night.
Rogers was clearly in shock; disbelief at the reality, then the immediate acceptance of the inevitable truth. What now, try to come back as an old man and flop, or drop the mic and bow out gracefully. Time will tell if pride will keep him or let him walk away head high. He’s not Brady, nobody is, it’s more realistic to just walk(or limp) away gracefully.
They are cursed until they uncove Jimmy Hoffa's bones under  Met Life and move back to NY.  Jets were stupid to let him walk
As a Bengal fan, Aaron’s injury brought back the horrifying memory in a playoff game from Jan. 2006 of the Pukesburgh STEALers doing their patented low hit, cheap shot artistry and rolling up Carson Palmer’s leg and shredding his knee! At least Rogers had 4 plays while Palmer got wrecked………ON THE FIRST PLAY of the game! Looks like both teams are snake bit! 😢

oh rich ...i feel your pain ...but my  god your so funny ....charger fan here ...got some trades for you ...jc jacskon for anyone off your practice roster....lol and we'll throw in BOSA and MACK
As a 49ers fan I feel you man. This is worse I know but losing a good QB 3 plays into an NFC championship game is hard to take. But Wilson could be your Purdy or Jimmy G. You never know. You said nards, 10 points.
Metlife needs to be domed, so better turf or grass can be installed. Enough of this.
Rich am sorry about your misery as a Jet fan but this was so damn entertaining!!! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
Bro....if we're looking at this from the perspective that youre referencing....you're the only reporting this way on something like this.....props....go Jets....and hopefully that Defense makes week 2 another classic with the Cowboys....
Oh MAN 😢😢😢😢😢
Carson Wentz isn’t a bad option. I’m a Commanders fan and can honestly say he wasn’t the reason they were losing last year. Scott Turner is a crap offensive play caller. I love how other qbs get the  benefit of the doubt when they have a change in staff around them throughout their careers, but not Wentz. 1 year with the Colts and 1 year with the Commanders is not enough time to build continuity at all. Matt Ryan suffered the same fate as Wentz last season, so maybe just maybe he wasn’t the problem in Indy either.
The Namath Curse lives on.

This guy overdoes the dramatics, And he's getting worse.
Joe Namath slept with the teen daughter of a dark lord of the Sith and got the team cursed.
Kind of tactless, making somebody's potentially career-ending injury all about you and your suffering as a fan. Pretty Tone-Deaf bro
Wilson may have learned from a graduate of QB U in Green Bay.
When that Achilles snapped, I knew then that I would never see the Jets in a Super Bowl.
"Jets fans arent allowed to have hope"  as a bears fan i say shut up
Jets fans actual 9/11
Rich Eisen was my first thought when it happened. He’s been so hyped, I feel for him. Sports is the only place that can create these type of up and down emotions in grown men.
Send Mo Lewis to talk to Tom Brady
Well at least the Jets don't have to give up a 1st round pick to the Packers
Sorry buddy
Bring back Fitz "magic"
Is that or is that NOT one of the most New York Jets things ever?!  First thing I thought of when I saw what happened to A-Rod in his first-ever Jets game, I thought: "I'm listening to Rich Eisen tomorrow morning." I LOVED his theatrical opening monologue, great Shining reference, and damn you Vinny Testaverde! Call Tom Brady?! haha hilarious!
I get angry with my Cowboys a lot, but I always remember it could be worse. I could be a Jets fan.
Let’s stay positive with this defense and running game I’m thinking 2000 Ravens
Hey Rich, Rodgers is now Mr irrelevant.  AH HA HA HA.
My only hopes are that he still maintains a presence in the QB room and Zach learns a thing or two from him.
Help Rich by giving to St. Judes
As a Jets fan, this resonates with me deeply.
Cam newton on the market pick him up New York 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
it's not a horror movie, it's a real thing that really happened, like when my dog died
You cant make this stuff up
Football gods only accept virgin sacrifices
Between this cry baby and Mike Greenberg I can't take it anymore. WE DON"T CARE ABOUT THE JETS!
5 snaps including the achilles
Two franchise star players, less than 24 hours apart, on the same exact turf... done for the season if not career, due to Achilles.    The owners of the jets and giants should rip that brand new turf out and plant grass... Rodgers and many others have been howling about turf.  ....now will the owners listen... ???
LOL!!! You are so great Rich!!!!
After watching AR play and be a part of our Packer nation for 18 years, I can tell you he wont lay down on this injury. He'll be back sooner than expected. I cant put into words how bad I feel for Aaron and the Jets. So much anticipation to finally have a winning team after many years, shut down in 5 min. Just unreal.  Then we have some shitty fans that enjoyed seeing AR get hurt. Those arent typical GB fans, theyre sickening trolls. Of course we dont want to see our QB of 18 yrs move on, but most of us still support and love AR. I wish the Jets   the best this season. And healing prayers for  Aaron.❤
jets fans were like man were gonna be like bucs were gonna get a great qb then win a superbowl 5 plays later that was out the window
“How are we back here again?” .. we pinned our hopes and dreams to a 40 year old QB.. this was going to be a possible outcome hanging over our heads all season.. should come as no surprise
Man i feel for real rich 😢 the curse is real 😂
Vinny and Aaron, Joe Theisman and Alex Smith. History rhymes, man.
I keep thinking about how the Jets swapped the 13th pick in the year's draft for the 15th to seal the Rodgers trade and then the Steelers took Broderick Jones with the 14th pick. That doesn't seem so inconsequential now.
"snaps" was not the best word to keep using for this particular video lol
And they paid for a 40 year old man to play a sport that ROUTINELY sidelines 100s of ‘youthful’ men every year!!
It's a damn shame!!!!! I expect Rodgers will be on the sidelines every game to coach Zach.
I heard a 5th snap 😎
Aarons done he’s never coming back…at least to the Jets ! 😮
Jets should call the future hall of famer that was recently released by the Pats my man Trace McSorley.
I’m a Viking fan, you don’t have anything on us.
The jets o-line is straight trash. It failed the entire game. Thats what u get for putting a hof qb out there without building the front. Sorry but thats what it comes down to. There was never any superbowl chances with that O-line. You all sound ridiculous"we have a champion ship defense blah blah" it takes more then a defense  and a good qb 😂
That horrific field needs to be changed to a grass field. How many more superstars have to be i
Wilson played okay. If he can play competent against the Bills, Jets D and their run game can definitely win 10-11 games. Wilson played a gutsy game.
Very entertaining. You're good at this. :)
This is amazing.
40 yr Packer fan here. Sorry fans and Jets team. Not sorry for Rodgers at all.
It was on 9/11. Blame the illuminati.
Rich is the only jets fan I feel bad for
Rich on fire here.....
I thought of Rich immediately. This is a tragedy.
Tom Tupa, by the way, was the Punter/ backup QB
Rodgers will retire, come back and join the Vikings. Lead them to the NFC Championship game and choke it away.
Just move the franchise already
Hello darkness my old friend
when you start to layoff all the drills and exercises you did to be athletic, you will not be able to put up with the weight being forced upon you as a NFL QB, This is liekley the case on Rodgers injury and a fact of life about being conditioned on daily agaenda as a Pro athlete and at all ages and levels with contact sports. Rodgers into more off field stuff than on the field in his age as his injury and how it folded proves this. No Longer Strong enough to even comp[ensate the weight being placed on. Old Man Ghadhoff lost his magic due to dating...
Jets just got Brady out of retirement and they will win a super bowl🎉😂
Two things should be clear.  1. No more turf.  2. Unless your name is Tom Brady. Teams need to stop paying old quarterbacks to change teams.
Why not give Carson Wentz another shot? He's gotta be better than Zach Wilson.
You want to blame something? Blame the astro turf.
Even as a Patriots fan I gotta feel bad for Jets fans.  All that hype.  All that anticipation.  Finally a chance.  Then 4 snaps for 0/1 C/ATT / 0 YRD / 0.0 AVG / 1-10 SACK / 2.6 QBR / 39.6 RTG and it's over.  Yikes.
As a bills fan we're cursed af can't get back to the sb
Poetic justice that he went down egotistically extending a play.
Great segment Rich i love this
Officially depressed
Devastating for Rodgers fans and Jets fans. I really wanted to see what he could do over there. Guess I have to adjust my pick for division winner. I'm curious how many other players are going to get season ending injuries on what is considered by most to be the worst turf in the game before they pony up and get something better, like maybe natural grass? Turf should be worked out of the game and definitely banned from any outdoor stadium.
Love my brother, he needs to get out my head, I feel him
Honestly that turf is a problem too there’s a chance with grass it gives out under his foot and that stress is not put on that Achilles, owners being cheap since turf is easier to maintain.
Switch to the Giants ,,, buddy
The NFL script writers…… they sure did get us already! Holy smokes the NFL never disappoints.   Shame that’s it’s on the coattails of Rodgers’ injury. Holy SMOKES.
For Jets fan today is worst day live in infamy Vinny & Rodgers get hurt day 😢  As a 49ers that turf is crap it hurt few 49ers ended the season almost.
Since the nfl is scripted, when they said, Rodgers you got to go out with acl tear. He said okay, but he didnt know how to sell it, I'm just walk it off
Imagine selling your next 5 years away to get 4 snaps. Next rebuild has officially started.
The pain in his voice. I thought it was hard being a Cowboys fan
Damn, I was looking forward to watching the Jets this season, I’m bummed and I’m a Packer fan. Can’t imagine what the Jets fans are feeling.
Sucks we may never get to see what rodgers and the jets had cooking. To a great career Arod!
Wow...this is so good . Vinny was at the game! This is unreal ! Lol
Karma has finally caught up to Rogers.
We drafted that stud floyed lol 😅 thanks sir u did the bears proud😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
Bahahahaha. Bahahahaha. Bahahahaha. Deal with it, losers.
zach wilson will shock the world 10-6
They need to get rid of that Astroturf everywhere it is. It is going to destroy football players careers. Let's hope that it's just a season ending injury and not a career ending injury for Aaron. It just breaks my heart to see this.
As a Command-skins fan … hate to see Rodgers do a ‘Fitztragic’ just like .. well Fitzpatrick
Does the phrase "snake-bit" mean anything to you?
Aaron Rodgers has been miserable for quite awhile..old, arrogant and a good act to follow.  Hes a loser
This is IT. The truest historical accompaniment of this moment. 😢 We a Packers fan, we hurt for 12. We hurt for Jets Nation.
Okay. I feel bad for diehard Jets fans like Rich. Completely unfair but season ending injuries happen, especially when the O-Line gives their opponents red carpet service to their future HOF QB.
No. Tom Brady is not an option. Have some dignity.
It’s not like the jets were going to the Super Bowl anyway
Jets fans are cursed Lmao !!!
😂😂
"The Misery of a Jets Fan", "A Jets' Fans Life", "Groundjets Day" ... I was so stoked to watch the Jets this year :(
Rich was the 1st person I thought of. Lmao. Poor guy.
Get Carson Wentz off the streets or trade for Gardner Minshew. GM gets you 13 wins, Carson gets you 11.
And why the hell would you want Tom Brady when he’s part owner of the Raiders
on top of the Jets crashing and burning, the Giants lost by a landslide shutdown, the Mets are in last place, the Yankees are in last place. Knicks probably gonna finish bottom of the league. NY and NY-adjacent teams are cursed.
As a Browns fan, I understand continued and relentless fan misery as much as anyone possibly can. So I really feel for the Jets fans today, losing a HOF QB after only 4 snaps is brutal. Awful for them, the team, and Rodgers. I hope the better days are coming soon for you guys.
You know they are going to outperform like crazy this season and then Aaron comes back and the QB who carried them this season will have to piss off.
Come on Man.... Did you really expect the Ole Man to make it through the entire season in the AFC...?
If you watched the pre game show, this is proof positive affirmation is bullshit. Old dude looked so hype in the interview
The curse of the Bambino Mr Eisen
If I am the owner, Saleh and the OC are fired immediately, if not sooner. Why do I say that? Duh, you know the D is going to be coming for AR like it`s WW3. Am I wrong there? Coming for him, all out, like WW3. A 100% certainty. What you don`t know is, how is the OLine going to do, how well are they going to hold up with the D coming all out like WW3. You also don`t know how AR is going to do. He ended 2 seasons ago really flat. Last season, his worst ever. 2 sub AR seasons in a row,  the guy is 40, and he took, what,  8 snaps in the preseason. You either start Wilson, to let the D burn off a little piss and vinegar, or, for the first few to several posessions, the plays called keep AR out of harms way, to try to see what the D has in mind. NYJ has the D to approach it like that, easily. Instead, Saleh, throwing ALL caution totally to the wind, runs plays that assumes that the OLine is going to protect a 40YO QB that is literally standing flat footed in the pocket. Inexcusable, absolutely.....
I’m convinced Namath made a deal with the devil. One championship for eternal suffering.
Dolphins Fan here … respect Saleh and The Jets defense. Was looking forward to a thrilling AFC East this season. It’s still a marathon in the NFL - anything can happen.
Lol Tom Brady would not risk his health on that O-Line. After seeing what happened to Rodgers
I was really looking forward to seeing what he could do this season. I’m not even a fan of his or the jets. Just awful.
Ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Rich Eisen is, by far, muy favorite sportscaster...  the guy is just fantastic.
The football gs want your first born sons
As a Lion fan... i literally feel bad for jets fans
Tom Brady to the jets rumors in 3…2…1….
I think Zach has shown a ton of maturity since last season. And he played much better than I thought that he was going to.
I'm a life long Packer who is gutted for 12 and Jets fans. This game sometimes.
An injury like that at Rodgers' age could easily be career ending
You got here because the Jets decided to try and win the game they shouldn't have and didn't get Trevor Lawrence.
As a Dolphins fan. Welcome to our lives since 1974. Yeah, the only team to ever go undefeated and win the Superbowl. What did it cost? EVERYTHING. We had one of the greatest QBs of ALL TIME and couldn't win the damn super bowl again.   Also. As a Phins fan, had Allen fake spiked it. I would have lost my mind.
since 1999? oh boy. lions have been in this misery since the 50's. Even with the chiefs win, we are all secretly waiting for the other paw to drop 😞
this is the american version of roger bennet and the pain and suffering of being an everton fan.
This isn't a horror movie, this is a TRAGEDY
Jets should relocate
Tim Tebow.
I couldn’t care less about the Jets but I couldn’t wait for Rich’s take this morning. It was even better than the game. Keep running Mr Eisen!!!
Viking Fan here, feel your pain with a cursed team!
I really hope this doesn’t stop the Jets from having a great season and making the playoffs
Absolutely hilarious. Rich Eisen is, BY FAR, the best!
Rich sounds hurt 😬😬🤣
Tom would literally come in and win the SB. Just how the universe works
Sorry Rich, was looking forward to watching your Jets with Rodgers at QB this year. 🙏 Hoping for a fast recovery for Aaron.
Knowing Aaron Rodgers he  did it on purpose.
Rich was Hysterical and it is understood.
Brutal, but remember they were only 1 game away from getting Trevor Lawrence....
"HOPE is what makes life TOLERABLE for us JET fans"
I feel bad for A Rod he’s my guy…but as for the Jets and Jets fans…man please…anytime some good fortune comes your way, it’s instant SB talk…no “hey let’s make the playoffs and see what happens”…no, “there are a lot of really good teams, our own division is really tough, we gotta take it one game at a time”…nope, instead they’re defense is the reincarnation of the 85 Bears, our receiving corps is the second coming of Jerry Rice and Terrell Owens, Breece Hall has morphed into Terrell Davis…even though I think the Jets are a good team, you guys always dial it up to 11 and completely disregard the competition and the season…just hand them the trophy, it’s far gone conclusion…who needs a full season right????
Turf needs to go. Dirt would’ve ripped out and might have saved his tendon…
As a Jags fan, I feel AWFUL for Jets fans, you can’t make this stuff up 😢
As a Jets fan, we can't have nice things.
T’s and P’s rich
No talking head combines reasoning with passion like Rich Eisen. Sorry for your loss Rich, but hang in there. There will be light at the end of the tunnel, although I don't know how long that tunnel is....
57 year old sufferer. The kids have no idea. I was in Denver as well, the ten point lead at half had us actually believing. God hates the Jets.
wow. what is like to be a jets fan? it must be miserable.  well atleast my pats may win one game against the jets this year, maybe. get a better field will u?
Wasn't living color three snaps
I've been asking the football gods the same thing for decades, as a Bengal fan. From a dropped interception that would've sealed a superbowl, to KiJana blowing out his knee before he ever had a chance, to a cheap shot on Palmer that cost us a playoff run,  to an opposing coach running out on the field that cost us a playoff run (even after everything else that happened just prior, Hill fumble, Burfict penalty), to our  #1 pick blowing out his knee first year. Only answer I ever got from them was just accept your fate
Vinny testerverte? Why not atleast mark Sanchez a jets QB who actually made an AFC championship game in the last 50 years.
I knew something would happen its the jets i thought theyd just be bad this feels less fun but same end result
Jets fans should be excited that zach Wilson atleast hasn't put his foot in his mouth since Aaron came, and has said to have improved and still found a way to win, force 3 picks. There still may be some hope. Not much, but that takes balls and coaching to still win that game
This is a legendary rant. I waited 16 hours for it. You delivered Rich
You need to change name of team to Jersey Jets -that will break the curse
Guess they should have invested in some blockers on the line. They were talking $#!T about the O-Line on Hard Knocks, and they didn't fail expectations in the regular season.
this was funny. mike greenberg on espn was downright pathetic
Sad to see what happened to Rodgers, but seeing what happened to him is exactly why Zach Wilson has struggled. Rodgers was running for his life on all 4 snaps, so how do you expect a young QB to do anything better? Not saying that Wilson is an amazing QB right now, but these Jets fans need to realize that the O-line is a massive problem and has been a reason for Wilson's bad time in NY.
Throw the ball more we need points Dallas his tough
Rich how about decaf coffee ?
Trust me rich bears fans can understand 😂
Don't get stuck on stupid Jets call Brady get him come on jets go
As a fan of the Bears, I'm really used to having a team with a championship defense and QB holding us back.  I've also had some experience having my heart broken by Aaron Rodgers.  Rich, if you need someone to talk to, I UNDERSTAND
So we will get to see a prime time scheduled season full of Zach Wilson after all. nice.
Maybe Rich and Mike Greenberg can get a group rate for therapy.
Jets fans should be glad that Rodgers won't be losing any playoff games for them, From Green Bay Packers fan!
Tom Brady isnt dumb enough to play behind that offensive line. Sorry.
That Shining reference was awesome!
as soon as that happened, i couldn’t wait for Eisen’s reaction.
Rich and all Jets fans: Don't give me hope... I'm a Texans fan, I understand your pain.
Rich Eisen has nailed this better than anyone has described anything in the history of human beings on this planet
Can't write this up
It’s the field.. I’m telling you get rid of that turf
Aaron Rodgers doesn't deserve this, however, to be fair, he's been a bit of a jerk and a drama queen the past few years, so, ultimately, meh.... next topic.
I'm honestly crying on the inside and I'm not even a Jets fan...
Definitely Butt Fumble 2
I'm an eagle fan rich and I really feel bad for you bro😢😢😢😢😢😢
Talk about foreshadowing
This team will suffer until they get their own stadium.Just embarrassing that they play in another team’s home.
My sincere condolences to the Jets and A.Rodgers, from a Dolphin fan. Hope quick recovery to your QB.!
The Jets are an absolute abomination. You take one of the greatest players to ever play and break him after 4 fucking snaps. You had SO many chances to address the O line or fix your travesty of a turf situation, and you didn't. There are some teams that know how to handle greatness, and some that aren't. The Jets are an embarrassment.
It’s my fault. I’m a Packer fan. But I had a pretty good feeling he was gonna go down early. Just too much hype. To good to be true. All the negatives on Zach Wilson. Just felt like Zach was going to end up being the guy anyway.   It’s over. Rodgers looked old on all 4 snaps. He turns 40 soon. He’s the oldest player in the NFL. And No. He’s not Tom Brady. Just gonna waste another year if he comes back next season. Rodgers needs to retreat from the NFL.
This is peak Jets football tbh
Poor rich was the first person I thought of last night 4-5 months of anticipation and excitement for less than 4-5 plays of pay off. I mean pushing 40 for QB maybe less drinking, hallucinogenics, ans dark rooms might of helped but hey knock the tb12 method everyone.
This is a tremendous loss for all for NFL football this year, regardless of what team you support.
As a lifelong Chicago Bears fan, I can’t help but laugh. I apologize. I know it’s wrong but 🤷🏻‍♂️😁🤣😂
This was the pinnacle of disaster in sports.  You could not wish more heartache on any team.
You can hear the pain in his voice
Karma sucks.
Perhaps with all the other injuries on MetLife. It’s time to go to grass field
Cam Newton
I swear they brought A-Rodge in to light a fire under Zach lmao. But the "Jets Quarterback Curse" is still a heavy burden to bear.
I haven't watched this clip yet, I am really hoping Brockman can not act like a child for 15 minutes. He ruins this show overall for me.
Football is a team sport.  I know a quarter back is a big deal but if thats all they got, its not giving the rest of the team much credit.
Bravo Rich!!!
I never saw the Scat Man and Aaron analogy comming......BRAVO
From a 49ers fan… I feel for all of you Jets fans right now. In the back of my mind, I thought that the Jets were going to be our opponent in the Super Bowl with Aaron Rodgers ultimately getting his final revenge over the Niners.
Just go with Wilson.  Change the offense up to help him as much as possible and when Rodgers is able to, have him on the sideline as Wilson's personal coach.  With the weapons around him and that defense, he could do just fine.
Love the use of the Back to the Future music  Insane about the Testaverde Anniversary - that he was there last night 😱👻  Not even a completion 🏈 😲
As a Jets fan I needed this rant
Call my cynical, but I can’t help but laugh at the entire story. I don’t wish injury on anybody but all of that hype just for this. Jets paid him $75 million guaranteed, just for that.
Rich should've had John McEnroe on the phone for this segment 😂
16+8
Karma came down hard on Rodgers and obnoxious Jets fan/ media members like Rich. I have no sympathy for any of them, especially the selfish narcissist who lied and badmouthed the Packers.  I also have no sympathy for the HC who publicly demoted Zack Wilson before he had any other QB on the roster..  RIch deserves the misery for his obnoxious behavior.
Jerry just said he'll trade Trey Lance for three 1st round picks😁
Josh Allen making terrible throws...
Not good for the game for Rodgers to go down like this. Maybe in a wierd way the team rallies around this and actually becomes a better team then riding on 12's back. We shall see.
Was looking forward to Aaron playing the 'Boys this Sunday
As soon as Rodgers went down I thought of you Rich.... I hope they find a QB that can take advantage of the great team and they still have a shot at that super bowl you have waited so long for.
Special thanks to Josh Allen for his contributions to the Jets cause.
How does Green Bay keep getting away with this? They get rid of HOF QBs just in time.
How do you really feel, Rich? That's not meant sarcastically - it's obvious how heartbroken he is as a result. When the hope you felt is so quickly dashed, man, it's rough. And the injury, not even a sprain or something that a few weeks off helps. Just - boom - season over.
Couldn't happen to a more deserving person - A Rogers!  Sometimes Karma comes back to bite you in the butt!!  He's past his expiration date....time to retire dude!!
I knew this would happen... AR is a crispy critter
Devastating
this just sucks so damn much
Why not do this segment in his iphone? Love when media giants use pedestrian forms of broadcasting.
That little Back to the Future soundbyte @0.38 REALLY got me. 🤣😂
This was gut wrenching and raw. I almost feel Rich's pain but then I remember I am a Raider fan and I'm still dealing with some decades of mediocrity and the Tuck Rule.
As a Patriots fan even tho we’re division rivals I can’t help to feel sorry for the Jets fans and Rogers, I was really looking forward for our games this season,  I’m still looking forward to them for your D tho that’s a championship D right there, see ya in a cloudless of weeks!
A Jet's fan since 81, we just are simply cursed! Everyone hates the Jet's and the NFL Gods hate the Jet's I mean for real world, we are on the ground pleading for our lives so why are you still stomping on us? We're dead already WE'RE DEAD good Gawd just let us bleed out and leave us alone for Fuck's sake!!!!
As a Bears fan, I feel for you Jets fans. It usually takes me a couple of weeks before the Bears dash all hope from my heart, but to feel it 4 plays into the season is just brutal. :-( Here's hoping Justin Fields and Zach Wilson are better than what people believe them to be. Also, this game reminded me of the "The are who we thought they were" game where all points for scored by defense and special teams, so there's still hope for the Jets.
Poor Rich...
He is no Tom Brady he is done...
Should have discount double checked his ankle tape.
Not to make things worse but the internet says the Achilles takes 10 to 12 months and 30 to 40% of players never return. this might be a silver lining that your number two picks gets to play
Jets need a cleanup of bad energies.  As a die hard Dolphins' fan I of course don't want the Jets to flourish. But that is just the sports rivalry. Sport feelings apart, I am deeply sorry for this event. Rodgers wouldn't deserve it, Jets wouldn't deserve it. I wish Aaron a full recovery.  But, as bizarre as it can be, Jets won.  Regarding las comments, I wouldn't agree on calling Brady in. I better foresee Aaron teaching Zach.
NY about to boycott earth wind and fire
Bears fan I feel your pain!
You have to have more of a life  than exaggerating about some 2 faced football player upsetting your day
There is a curse on us and I can't deal with it anymore 🤦🏿‍♂️the wave of emotions last night was insane..
Zach Wilson will find a way to get this team to the playoffs. The Jets aren't my team, but I would love to see it
What do the football gods want? Natural turf.
Whoa Whoa Whoa.  The Shining?!?!  Spoiler Alert Rich.
I'm  a browns  fan, still below you. I feel your pain.
Nobody wishes this on any player on any team. To start the season? Wow.
I remember when the 49ers played the jets in 2020 and met life claimed the acl of Bosa and Thomas. It also took out Jimmy G's ankle and Raheem Mostert's knee.
"The twin towers are tails"
You're making that vinnie testosterone story up,the gods dont lineup like that.
It is sad for jet fans,  it is hard.  Not a Rodgers fan, but it is sad for the fans, so much hope.  Maybe wilson will develop enough,  Jets have a good defense, and a good head coach.
I see your Jets QB bad luck and raise you Washington’s. 33 to the day that Joe T and Alex Smith’s legs breaking and as in the QB that cracked his neck head butting the wall…futility!
WOW I FEEL HIM WOW
Funny guy wow
Kirk Cousins is available.  He's very durable.  The Vikings would take a backup longsnapper, practice squad kicker, and 7th round pick for him.  Make the deal!
Thank you. I needed someone to put this in "Testaverde perspective."
Blame your owner and GM for wasting money on a 39 year old investment that can’t win no more championships
As a Cowboys fan i was looking forward to playing the Jets with Aaron Rodgers now that goes up in smoke! I hope he recovers and plays again if he feels up to it.
You have to have a offensive line!!!!
From "the Packers should just let Rodgers go to NY for free" to "we have all the leverage" to "no way you get a First Round pick" to "we won the trade."  Couldn't have happened to a more smug fanbase. A huge LOL at you Jets fans
Jets fans need a blood sacrifice to get a SB 😂
Man I absolutely live for jets chaos
Colt McCoy still needs a job Rich.
The story should be.  How ‘bout them Jets.  What a game.  Great D.  Overcoming the unthinkable.   Let’s rally behind these guys.  Just saying.  And I’m not even a jets fan.  Steeler fan.   Your 1-0.  You can’t be any better right now.
The "Shinning" comparison is flat out hilarious!....  AA-Rod is prob my least fav player in the league.  That being said, I never hope for any player to get injured.  With all the hype coming into the season w him & the Jets, this is a huge blow to both NY & the league (& all fans).  Maybe having Vinny there was the best idea on the Jets' part......
Congrats on the win. Sucks real bad for Jets fans, and for Aaron Rogers. I had no faith in Zach, but he had some good moments, and the team is solid.
If I was a bad man I’d say it raises the Jets chance to go to the SB significantly now that AR is out given his performance in the playoffs for the last decade .
The Jets DC in 99 was Belichick
Q  What do you want from us ?           A    Grass fields
Just as good as a stephen a knicks rant
The probability of Aaron Rodgers having a serious injury was enhanced by him being 39 years old.   The NFL demands supreme athleticism, and when you're pushing 40 you're pushing your luck.   Tom Brady was a real outlier.   Rich's Tom Tupa sarcasm not warranted.  Tupa - not much of a QB, a good punter, a supreme athlete.   In today's game, he would have made a good living executing fakes on 4rth down.
Who all was waiting for Rich's reaction?? Immediately afterwards thought about him. Brutal
He's extremely wealthy. Aaron will be fine. At this point he should retire.  I suffered an Achilles tear in 2017 and it was devastating for me.
Imagine putting your faith in a 40yr old Peter Pan QB
I've said it for years ( just look at my Geno Smith youtube posts going back many years) the Jets is a QB career killing organization! Some way, somehow, QB careers are destroyed when signing with the Jets! Last night was yet another example! Really feel bad for Aaron. He's in a tough spot now. Do I retire and leave this as my legacy or do I grind it out for a return when I'm on my way out mentally anyways...
Maybe the jets should stop dumpster diving for hired aging guns
I'll try to put a positive spin on this, despite not really caring about the Jets at all. I actually think Zach Wilson is a decent QB, but his biggest downside was attitude. He seemed to have that Baker Mayfield-esque off-putting demeanor.   Then Rodgers comes in. It probably humbles Zach quite a bit. He learns an important intangible that doesn't show up on the stat sheet: likeability. He's got a pretty good team around him, and a second chance to win them over. I truly think if he starts behaving (not necessarily playing) more like Lamar Jackson and less like Baker Mayfield, the Jets are still the favorite in the East and a legit playoff contender.
Wow!
Let's hope that these Jets don't repeat the same mistake that Parcells made. He stuck with Rick Mirer for far too long - all because he was once the #2 overall draft pick. Sounds familiar? If Parcells had turned to Ray Lucas earlier, the Jets might still have made the playoffs in the '99 season.  Look. I like Zach. I hope he balls out and proves all the skeptics like me wrong. However, I'm not going to put any faith in Zach. My greatest fear is that history will repeat itself again. The Jets and Saleh will stick with Zach too long. The sunk cost fallacy is a real killer.  Now that Mike White is not around to save the day anymore, the Jets need a viable backup plan in case Zach flops. Maybe the Jags would be willing to trade Nathan Rourke?
Not worth being dramatic about it. An important player goes down and the backup has to play. Jets are still well positioned to get into the playoffs where anything can happen. They just beat the Bills who are a Super Bowl contender.
RODGERS SPEEDRUNNING TO DESTROY JETS HOPE
What a kick to the ⚽️ s 🫨
This is the worst tragedy to ever happen to new york on any september 11th ever
The 4 snaps of Rodgers you got were him running for his life trying not to get crushed...
Dan Hanzus said the same thing lol
Man this was a master class in the 5 stages of grief. That bargaining bit at the end was classic
ahh man the  .. come on football gods ........ what do you want from us ??? thats exactly how i feel...
Jets need to move to another state and rebrand
I’m sorry for your loss rich
LET IT ROAR RICH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Being a Vikings fan is worse
WHAT THE SNUFF VINNY
Aaron…aaron. Why did u spin? Just take the sack man. U r 40 years old…..goshhhh.
As a Bills fan, while I acknowledge we self imploded, the Jets looked and felt good. Led by Wilson too. If they don’t treat him like a child, the Jets will be competitive this season
I wonder what happened to all the asshats last night that were laughing and making fun of the team and saying Rodgers went down on purpose to not have to play. Funny how once there's confirmation of the injury everyone decides to say they're "devastated" or that it's "so unfortunate" despite wanting his and the Jets downfall for some odd reason.
Wtf is likens didnt know that was a word  do you not have to know how to spell or use real words to be a youtuber
JEST FANS SOUNDS SO SIMILAR TO BENGALS FAN !!!!!!
The Jet's made the mistake of not spending the money Aaron Rodgers gave back to them on a Left Tackle. Duane Brown might be the best one by the end of the season, yet we all knew that he was coming off the injury list and that something like this could happen.
I'm a Patriots fan & I am here not to gloat, I really like Rich & feel for him & the die hard Jets fans I was genuinely intrigued to see how Rodgers in NY 🗽 would play out. I wish him a speedy recovery. It would put the cat 🙀 amongst the pigeons if we beat Miami next week to make the AFC East interesting but sorry Rich & Jets fans.
People screaming for Tom Brady are so funny 😂 You Think Tom Brady wants to come play behind the Jets Offensive Line which just got Aaron Rodgers taken out for the season?!?  People, get a grip and hold on tight! Jets are cursed
As a Detroit sports fan it’s hard to listen to other fan bases talk about their “misery”
If I didn't believe in curses.......
It’s the hope that kills you unfortunately.
I'm not on twitter, but I was googling Eisen + Twitter + X last night
This is why we watch football.
no o line. Its like buying a ferrari and then driving it on the street with no insurance
Man plans, God laughs
As a Niners fan not sure I have ever been more gutted for another team and then so thrilled with that punt return and how the game ended. Then hearing Saleh in the press confrence say "it's not good" 😢
Brady will never be a jet
Rich had singlehandedly built up my hype over the Jets And when that play happened last night I felt sick to my stomach and then felt bad for Rich and every Jets fan. Smh sorry guys 💚 That defense is amazing, Breece is a beast and Garrett is that dude! Keep your heads up!
I have been waiting for this all night!!!😂
That Shining reference was spot on
YO RICH FROM A BENGALS FANN HERE BRO I UNDERSTAND HOW YOUR FEELING OMG TRUST ME UNBELIEVABLE CANT BELIEVE WHAT I SEEN KEEP YA HEAD UP BRO I LOVE YA SHOW !!!!
Zac got do a sanchez
Damn the passion is really bursting through here. I feel so bad for Rich and Jets fans fr
Jets fans stop crying , at least you have 1 Super Bowl, some teams have none !  Aaron was talking smack all season and the season before … smarty one ☝️
As a bears fan i was hurt to see Rogers carted off, I feel for you Jets fan, I was rooting for y’all to win the afc
Poor Rich! Looks like he's snapped as much as Aaron Rodgers' left Achilles tendon. Wish it had turned out better for Jets fans than this. 😢
As a raiders fan I’m sympathize with rich
Rogers looked relieved when he realized he was done.
After moving to Michigan and living with Lions fans, the Jets have had an easy 60 years. My father in law still tells me "I am 65 years old and have only saw the lions win 1 playoff game". The jets are cursed yes but not as bad as the lions
God......!!!! Sorry Rich.  It was an exciting and one of the best off seasons
Aaron Rodgers died so the Lions can live!
Im bummed everyone that love football is bummed but to lighten mood imagine a Fox movie of the week "God Damn it Vinny" The story of the Aaron Rodgers 2023/24 season ending injury, staring Vinny Testivertie as the spiritual goon the screws everything up haha poor guys:(
HEY RICH SORRY BRO I REMEMBER 99
I'm not religious in any way, and yet the ONLY reason I feel like there must be some higher power out there, is that there feels like there is some kind of higher power that despises this team. Year after year, we get just enough of a crumb to believe that finally, THIS TIME will be different... and then every single year, the rug gets pulled out from under us and we fall apart in the most over-dramatic and humiliating way possible. Four measly snaps. You just couldn't make this up if you tried...
The NFL needs to get rid of all turf fields.  The players don’t want to play on them
I'm a Lions fan. Cry me a river, Rich...
Just an awesome rant!!
The Carson Palmer and Tom Brady injuries were a big impetus for the NFL changing rules around hitting quarterbacks.  Maybe this can finally be the impetus for banning these garbage artificial turfs that cause so many unnecessary injuries.
Did Allen do a butt fumble?
one of if not the funniest football i ever heard. rob riggle on fox nfl sunday. "Jets fans like to reminisce about the god ole day. that one damn day."
Jets should hit up Saints for the ex number 1 overall pick in Jameis Winston and see what they can get for him. Winston would be the perfect on that Jets team.
I’m done man, fantasy football. I’m a football fan I can’t be a Jets fan anymore
As a Packer fan who has had my problems with Arod. He treated the Packer organization terribly. He is a head case. But this!!!! No. No way. I'm in shock. I feel so badly for him. Aaron Packer nation loves you and prays for a full recovery.
No mention of the leg whip on the punt return?  Cmon.
Rich you are out rational.  And you deserve to not be rational.  It’s OK.  The rest of us are crushed.  Aaron is a class guy.  Everyone was ecstatic about Rogers joining the Jets, plus the amazingly talented defense.  A match made in heaven suddenly disappeared.  Sad for the Jets, sad for NY.  But. . . . In spite of it all, they managed a win.  Says a lot about their character.
This whole thing is Titanic in nature, only the sinking occurs in the harbor 😮 I didn't think injury to Rogers, but after that, over-the-top, Team Intro with thr green lights, smoke and  fireworks, I said to myself, "that was excessive, they'll have to be karmic payback for that . . ." I thought they would lose the game, NOT Rogers for the whole season 😬
Terrible news.  I too thought of Rich when Aaron was carted off.  A lifelong Giants fan, I remember when LT tore his Achilles tendon.  He wasn't 39, but he tried to come back the next year and lasted only one season. Jets fans deserve better.
Jets player proved they are a contender. If they all play like winners they will win.
Rich love the Shining analogy. You had me in tears.
It seems like being a Jets fan is a lot like being a Mets fan!
I'm a Bears fan but I was looking forward to see what the Jets could do with Rodgers. Football is just better with Rodgers in the game.
4 snaps?  What took so long?
Poor Rich. Try being a Bears fan Rich
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Im really now convinced that no QB can be successful until the great Joe Namath is no longer with us.  The curse is absolutely real.  This is gut wrenching.....
Jets definitely have an incredible defense but Josh legit had 10 yards to walk to a first down and launched it downfield into triple coverage. Then has Diggs and Kincaid wide open right in front of him and throws into triple coverage. He just had a terrible game. But well be ok. Bills still winning the BOWL! Jets wouldve been a massive problem this year for us. We struggle mightily against this defense. But man do the Bills shoot themselves in the foot.  GO BILLS!
Get behind the Kid, Jets fan.  I said it last night after AR went down.  You want to be a Jets legend, Kid, win this game. And you pulled it off!!
And just like that the Patriots no longer have the worst QB in the division
God hates the Jets
As a Pats fan I understand this feeling. Having just watched your team go 18-0 and be the luckiest catch in history away from 19-0 to Brady tearing his ACL week 1 instead of who knows what that 2008 team wouldve done... It sucks. Anyone that's a fan of the game of football... Rodgers being out sucks.
Why would they invite Vinny of all people to flip the damn coin...... JINX Keep that BS from the past away from the stadium BAD ENERGY
Uhh, bye bye Jets! Thank God the Raiders didn't get him.
Not as bad as being a Nebraska Husker fan.
CAM MF NEWTTTOONNNNNN
Namath sold the jets soul for that Super Bowl
Jets will still retire his number since he went 1-0
Hey Dallas has extra qb’s. Aaron gets back at Green Bay because they won’t get a first round pick.
Hey rich f you have any connections tell higher ups to go get nick Foles get rid of the pretend grass and put down Bill Murray’s Kentucky sesamea grass and keep these Kenny O’Brien uniforms I have more but that’s enough for now
Calm down, bro, you're gonna break a nail. It's only week one jets will fall on their face. Buffalo will win the division. Alan is not going to throw 4 interceptions every game.
I’d take Mike White or Darnold back right about now…
Rich…join the dark side and start rooting for your wife’s team
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Rich, I’m very sorry.
Rich, I don't know you at all but I like your show.  I want to answer the question you imposed about what do the football gods want you to do.  I think the Jets fan need an attitude adjustment.  They are known as the worst fans in the country, no patience, no understanding and throw them under the bus if  they don't perform to their liking.  You need to appreciate the players you have and the effort they put forward to win.  Love them, nourish them, be loyal to them.  I have to laugh, every team goes through this.  Years ago I had a good friend who was a loyal fourtyniner fan and this was before Joe Montana, and after the first kickoff of the season the fans and he would Holler"Wait till next year".  AS I look back on it, it was quiet funny.  The Jet's have good coaches and good players, young men who will do all they can to win for you.  Love them, support them, forgive them.  They will love you for that and you will have a championship sooner than you think.  Thank you again Rich, I don't know about football gods but there is a God in heaven and he loves you and wants the very best for you. I'm an old man so I can say that.
As a Pittsburgh Pirates fan, I wonder if it's better to have no hope at all, or to have hope only to have it snatched from you? Feel bad for Jets fans today.
BAN Artifical turf. if NFL really wants to address injury concerns.
can't make this stuff up any better,  sorry for your hopes and dreams.   -lions fan
Don't worry, the Jets can pick up Joe Flacco. He's elite.
All the tears of unfathomable sadness from sooooo many fraudgers boot lickers....this just ends your self inflicted misery sooner. Guy is nothing more than a proven LOSER
Been waiting on this
Elway didn’t play in the 1999 season
Wow, what's with all of these people suddenly believing in modern medicine?  Why would anyone believe the results of an MRI or the inability to place pressure on his foot?   Just have him give Joe Rogan a call to score some Ivermectin and he should be back in practice by tomorrow.   C'mon Kaaron, show us how it works.  Don't be a slave to the lies of big medicine.
The Jets should sign Kurt Benkert and let him and Wilson battle it out for starter spot.
Maybe some ayahuasca will heal the PITA diva's sore heel, as it appears that someone's karma ran over his dogma....
Raider Nation is 🙏🏼 AR8 comes back to the ✈️. ✈️ AFL 1sr SB 🏆 RESPECT! We understand the pain.
JETS ARE BUMS !!!!!!!!!!!!!¡!!!!!
I was excited to see how he would do at the Jets. Bummer.  Saleh is awesome.  Loved him when he was DC for my Niners. I’m bummed for the Jets fans too. This sucks.
Sorry for the loss
Love ya, Rich.
Wow. I was not aware the Vinny was an honorary captain and there. Nor was I aware today is the day Vinny blew his Achilles. It does make you question if the Jets are cursed.
It doesn't hurt that Josh Allen played like crap
Hard Knocks. It’s a curse
This is the take I’ve been waiting to here on this, sorry Rich
rich eisen never analyzes, hes great at regurgitating history and things that we already know. i dont ever learn anything new from this show, ill stop watching now. thank yall gtg
The Jets bad luck reminds me of the Red Sox curse.
I will always root against the Jets. It's in my bones as a Pats fan.  This is not how I wanted them to fail. Sucks.
😂😂😂😂 Jets fans can never catch a break. As a football fan, I  dont really care or feel bad. The show goes on.
A Rod is wise and experienced, Saleh is a great coach and knows what he is doing, if they trust Zach, them I trust him too
good analogy with The Shining. Sorry, Rich. Sucks for Aaron.
epic show Rich Eisen. Very very sorry for you and Jet fans. my sincere condolences from a Seahawk.
I was actually excited to see the Jets and Bills play as teams that could be in the race at the end of the year...relatively new teams to that race...and then the injury...Jets fans and Cubs fans must have a secret sympathy club...
As a Pats fan, HAHAHAHAHAHAHA the devil is a jets fan
I’m just here to conduct a welfare check on rich
True fan angst.
"God doesn't care who wins football games" - Aaron Rodgers
2 teams the football gods absolutely HATE for SOME F&^%$ing  reason  1. Jets 2. Chargers
I’m a Steelers fan and my Super Bowl pick was the jets and then just 4 plays in for Rodgers he’s done… I’m sorry jets fans, and football fans everywhere.. Painful to see one of the greats go down especially as excited as he was to start a new part of his career there…
That back to the future sound effects reference was on point
this jets season is basically the beginning of Scream when Drew Barrymore gets killed
Zach Wilson is going to be the new Alex Smith. The 49ers were the worst thing that ever happened to Smith. The Jets are the worst thing that ever happened to Sanchez/Darnold/Wilson/etc. When Dan Marino says his prayers at night, he thanks God for Ken O'Brien.
RIP Hallorann
The football gods want joe Namath to give up his soul then and only then will all debts be paid
Maybe Rodgers can get his Achilles immunized 😂
Can Teste still play? 😂
Yeah...at this point, Patriots fans can turn in their Aaron Rogers voodoo dolls. There is DEFINITELY such thing as a Jets' Quarterback Curse.
Will you people stop all of the damn pity don't get me wrong I feel bad for this guy and I hope he makes a full recovery but if all you pity Partiers don't stop you're going to have the NFL overreacting yet again next it will be two hand touch on the quarterback it's football people For Heaven's Sake!!
I was so excited to see this Jets team, I am a Pats fan, but still, feel for the whole team.
I understand Aaron Rodgers got hurt. But try being a bills fan today. Losing to a team that you should have won against after their quarterback. Went your quarterback who you thinking is a Generational talent throw three interceptions and lose a fumble he should have just fell on
As a Lions fan I laugh at the "Woe is me" take for Jets fans. Not win a playoff game since 1992 and then come and call me
“I’m not rational right now.” Maybe start with that. This was great.
As a Bills fan, I actually got nervous when I saw Wilson come in.  He has our number!😅
Jets should be ASHAMED for not having a grass field!!!!!!!!!!!!
I feel bad for Aaron Rodgers. He did not deserve to have his career end like that.   Jets fan though… HAHAHAHA!!! Your team is cursed! Same old Jets!
What do the football gods want from us, you ask???  Anal. And they’ve been getting it for 54 f’n years…
☹️
I really don't like Rodgers , and not much of a fan on the J.E.T.S. ; however didn't want to see this for either.  Damn- Ron Simmons
I am sorry Denver caused you pain
Hated to see that happen.  I wanted my Fins to beat up on Aaron 2 times this year.
If I'm Tom Brady I'm not picking up the phone with that O Line.
The NFL backed blm terrorists.  Just remember that.
Jets calling Brady like Plzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
It's gotta be the turf at that stadium, sad...
Definition of a "bummer", All the off-season drama with the packers, the darkness retreat, getting with the jets, hard-knocks. All to just be done for the season, maybe permanently. So sorry jets fans
Get Brady.
Jets fans deserve this. They're such doochbags.
Jets new season kickoff... "the kicker lines up to kick off the opening season, he winds up, kicks off, aannd.. the season's over!"🤣
To be fair, when Jason Street went down in the first series, and Matt Saracen came on, no one gave him a chance. But in the end, Matt took them to states a few times, and won a ring. Not to mention, in the end he got the coaches daughter. So, yeah, KAaron....
LOL  browns are no longer cursed
Football God's only want one thing.Its our forced out of us"misery"
There are 5 more prime time Jets games. I hope they do something at QB.
Well he has time to hang out in his 10m home in nj.
THIS is why the Jets can never have nice things.
I get it I'm a Bengals fan, and it's been like this until 2 years ago... Go Jets this team is good and likable✈️
This guy is absolutely hilarious
Never in my life been happy about a football injury.  But this couldn't have happened to a more deserving person.  Hope he's WOKE now. 1 superbowl diva Karen rogers.
So sorry Rich. So sorry Jets fans. Curse of the Namath?
It makes me sad for Joe Namath. He probably would've won 8 super bowls with any other team.
Absolutely sickening.
This was great, this was awesome.  All the off-season talk, will he or won’t he…. To see him just last a couple plays had me laughing 😅
Rich im so sorry As a fellow fan ......But i agree on this one God id screwing wid ya
So who are getting for a backup QB? I have faith in this team and zack Wilson as qb1
I’m sorry jets fans .. fr y’all deserve better . Coming from a cowboys fan . I hope the jets go far soon . I would love to see it .
As an Eagles fan I can relate. Did not Randle Cunningham make US🦅 BELIEVE🙏?! What was it, the second game of '93, when the JETS blew out his ACL leaving us with.. Bubby Brister😮‍💨?!
It bad but aleast won superbowl long long time again...as viking  fan no super bowl too show for..
As a Lions fan, I feel for Jets fans. BUT.....Jets still have more playoff wins in the last 13 years than the Lions have in the last 65.
Not sure how much superstition gets involved when you put a 39 year old man, remarkable as Rodgers is, behind a poor offensive line.
Boo hoo rich! Im a Washington fan so i dont feel bad
24 years ago - 16 (Vinnys jersey #) = 8 (Rodgers jersey #)
Vikings fan checking in. We know all too well.
The Jets couldn't pick a quarterback for their team if their lives depended on it.  As soon as the Jets signed Aaron Rodgers, I thought "Well, it's too bad Aaron Rodgers is going to have a horrible year!!"  I don't dislike Aaron Rodgers, but it literally a law of nature that whatever quarterback the Jets have as the starter, he will have a horrible year.
As a Raider fan all I heard was don't take Jimmy G he is way to prone for injury go after Rodgers. The diva is done !!! Go sit in a dark room for 3 days Aaron and meditate about it LMAO
Rich eisen has some amazing writers. That scatman crothers analogy was good. I wonder if he is related to hayley eisenberg?
Perhaps signing quarterbacks under the age of 39 is a better path to success?
I don't know what team is cursed by the football gods more Chicago or the jets it just doesn't seek fair or right
Aaron Rogers 2021: publicly lies about getting vaccinated Karma 2023: 🖕Aaron Rogers
Have the jet’s officially just surpassed the browns as the most unfortunate franchise???
Go Pats
Damn I know your pain Raiders Nation feels for the Jets doesn’t change anything that’s why we’re loyal fans
Bummer.
Rodgers is expected to return this year after some innovative treatment with ivermectin, bleach, and light therapy.
Football gods WHAT DO YOU WANT
Should have traded for Derek Carr instead😂
Josh Allen is Carson Wentz
Rich Eisen is a legend!
As Broncos fan I never saw that AFC championship i was 10 years old...but I feel for the jets right now
As a Patriots fan, as much as I hate seeing Aaron Rodgers’s career potentially end this way, I’m ecstatic over that game as a whole. This might be sociopathic to say, but Zach Wilson’s back under center for the Jets, the Bills were held to a mere 16 points, and we ourselves just held the Super Bowl runners-up to 12 points on offense! Technically 18, but I’m not counting the extra 6 because of the short field. Suddenly, the division is very much in play for us! We just gotta beat the Dolphins in Foxboro, steal a game from the Bills, and the Jets games are most likely wins now! Okay, the division might be ambitious, but we’re at least good for a wildcard! From there, who even knows?!?
I honestly figured Rodgers to last about 4 games but 4 plays, who woulda thunk it?  Dang ayahuasca let me down
Guess karma came back to bite rodgers
"We will rally around Zach Wilson and play good football" -- my condolences, and offers of hope, from a Rams fan.
im 35 kept up with football since i was 10 ... i cant remember a bigger gut punch to a fan base then this injury... not the longest time watching the nfl compared to most but damn it seems like one of the most devastating injuries of all time
With this type of injury at his age will this be the end for Aaron Rodgers. 😢😢😢
I’m bummed for Aaron but low-key overly enjoying the suffering from Jets fans 😂😂😂.
The back to the future sound effects 🤣✈️
They need to get A-rod to give back some of the guaranteed millions. Then they need to fix that effing O-Line!
I couldn’t be more happy- a patriots fan
Dolphins fan here.. and the first two people I thought about were You And Greeny from Espn. I was looking forward to our 2 division games this year.
Can we all agree that not only should the Jets never be allowed to draft a quarterback in the first round ever again, but they should also never be allowed to sign a high-end free agent quarterback ever again? If the Bears are where wide receivers go to die, the Jets are where quarterbacks go to be aborted.
All jokes aside , Brockman laughing in this segment is out of order. Bad for the jets,absolutely,  but just bad in general for all football fans.  Lousy on Aaron
Thanks you for expressing the pain
Pats fan here and can't believe I'm saying this - but I hope Wilson takes y'all on a run.
Jets need to move back to Queens to break the curse.
Karma, she's a B!!
Jets are such a cursed franchise. They're the Mets of the NFL. Feels bad man
The fact that the same thing has happened to the Jets in the past is testimony that it really isn't all bad luck. Not everyone is Brady who is an outlier. A 40 year old quarterback with a history of calf injuries is very likely to get hurt. The Jets rolled the dice in a bet that no other NFL team was interested in and lost. It is not justified to cry to the heavens about your bad fate.
Damn. Thats all i got
I feel like Rich should have taken a sick day today... no one would have held it against him.
Seahawks fan here but I love Aaron Rodgers and have liked him his entire career this sucks big time I wanted him to win to do good.
I am convinced that when Joe Namath passes, the Jets luck will turn around.  The football gods gave them the guarantee, and this is the penance.
Meanwhile i believe in the curse of the Jets. So sorry for AR, hope he gets recovered fast! No one deserve any injury. 😢
sucks for rodgers, but this is karma for rich being such a hater all the fucking time lol. the football gods stole his joy
Wow, that's kind of creepy lol
The Bears and the Jets I think share similar misery.  We can’t have nice things and always fail miserably, one Super Bowl title each, no good QBs, constantly getting beaten down by you’re big brother and division rival.  At least the Jets have a Defense and looks like a better defensive coach
I think the Football Gods might remind you of one simple commandment: Thou shalt not covet other teams' quarterbacks.  Look what Zachy did last night! Look at how his receivers embraced him! Let's goooo!
The back to the future sound effect was gold
Did the New York Jets do something to the Gods in a prior lifetime? I mean, we are snake bitten!
Coming from a Lions fan, we know the pain and all of our radio and podcast are all bummed. Despite our hatred for Aaron Rodgers I haven't heard one person say anything negative and only sympathy for you guys. It sucks. That being said, that offensive o line needs to protect the QB. Zach Wilson almost got injured too. If the o line going to continue to play like that your going to need to have 3 qbs ready every game to be safe
Rodgers is 39 years old. The likely hood of an injury is increased for any older player. The Jets opted to go into this season with an insufficient back up QB. Was that decision made because of money? No viable candidates that are considered better than Wilson? Or did they just wing it and hope for the best. Regardless, the Jets weren’t prepared for this more than probable scenario.
A 40yr old bout to retire at any moment. But u had high hopes. Put the pipe down
Funniest story I've ever heard
As a longtime Bears fan, I can certainly empathize with Jets fans.  I actually thought of Rich last night when they carted Rodgers off.  Zach Wilson – whoever he is – will not lead them to the promised land.
Waaa
“All work and No play” 😂😂😂
Yeah, it is weird as Chiefs fan, but I really was rooting for Jets to do well. I watched the Jets and Namath win it all in 68-69 and was hopeful ,if not Chiefs,Jets could get there and pull off the unthinkable. I think Rodgers was done even before injury .His body language and look on his face told a sad tale .An old quarterback who looked skittish and uncomfortable. I thnk Aaron was passionate about the idea of playing for Jets but the reality is different ..Hes just not into it anymore, it seems. However ,he brought excitement, hope ,coaches , players along. All fans should appreciate that element but its probably not going to be a viable opportunity for Aaron, at 41 next year and probably still.a subpar offensive line.
Who cut block on a 3 step drop.. just keep on protecting cuz some plays will not go according to plan.
The truth of the matter is the O-line sucks bad.  No QB in the world can succeed with a high school O-line.
Yes .... perfect situation for Carson Wentz to step in ... it would be the best team to surround Wentz and he would thrive
Rich, only a true jet fan could express that so accurately, so tragically, and we feel it that way too. Football has been cruel to us.
Being a big Bengals fan who also loves Jags, Dolphins and niners, I was so hyped for Jets this season. I was rooting for them last night and that crap happened. I felt like somebody shot me in the chest. So devastated for the jets fans and the team. I want Zach to grow up and take the charge and show the world he can do it. He hung in there yesterday so it's a huge victory in itself.
As a lions fan, we’ve felt your pain in many ways. I called this one though, said they ashould have been upgrading the oline instead of all of the WR.
The pain in his voice at 3:57... cant believe this is real...
He didn't deserve to go out like this. I hope he comes back
Well that's what you get from a 40 yr old with a history of calf problems. I'm not surprised.
I love it for rich
Jets Fan Here Who Was Never a Big Rodgers Fan...The Energy and Visual of Him Running on to The Field Carrying American Flag IMMEDIATELY Changed My Attitude and i Was Sold and 100% Ready to EMBRACE Our New QB...Jets are Cursed
How many top tier players have to have their seasons end on that field before the NFL does anything? Its obscene at this point, and so many of these catastrophic injuries are EARLY in the season. Having ease of transition into concerts and other events should not come before the SAFETY OF THE PLAYERS THAT THE STADIUM WAS BUILT FOR.
They didnt protect him nor Wilson so if they dont do something soon the back up damn near got put out with no 3rd QB....  Aaron should have went somewhere with a good line...damn.....
Steelers fan here,  sorry for you guys. We will send you all Mason Rudolph to help you  guys . Give us  your back up Center in a trade .
God damn script writers
All I could think about after that injury was how unhinged Rich was going to be on today's show, and I wasn't disappointed.
Sorry Jets fans...as a 49er fan I understand your pain
feel so bad for jets fans, not fair at all, at least the defense is top tier
The most Jets thing ever.
Maybe get an O line before you invest in a QB? Kind of on the GM if you ask me...
Trade for HoF QB Mike F'n White!!
Well the good part is it helps the hapless patriots
When Aaron Rodgers ruptured his Achilles I immediately thought about Rich Eisen & Mike Greenberg…I hate that for Jets Nation
Rich...your company has some people that can talk to you...they might be able to help...🏈
As a lifelong fan who has been crushed by the weight unrealized high expectations for our football team,  I invite you to join us in Detroit for our once in a century shot....it's gonna happen this year !
"The Dolphins won Monday Night Football." - Dan Le Batard
Jets mortgaged it's future on Rodgers. They built a stellar roster through the draft! Whiffed on the QB twice, now they can't move up in the draft to grab  QB because they gave away their picks.
15:25 Rich doesn't understand that Joe Namath signed a deal with the devil. So the Jets will never win another Super Bowl while he is still alive.
As a Bucs fan this was my greatest fear when Brady came to Tampa
Man, I was happy for Jets getting Rodgers, but it sucks now their chances of winning games are slim. This coming from a pats fan
They have such a good, rushing attack and defense. They can totally bring back some old-school Smash Mouth football and compete.
At least you can point to an incident and say “that…. that right there is the reason we have no chance of making the playoffs”.  There is nothing for the Bears fans.  Even if every starting player was healthy for the reminder of the season, we f**king stink at every position…. bar RB… perhaps.  It is soul destroying watching incompetent QB play, incomprehensible play calling, half arsed efforts and confused defensive performances.  At least the Jets have a defence to keep them in games, sound wide receivers and a fantastic running back to keep the embers of hope alive.
As a Packers fan I feel for the Jets. That’s brutal and scriptwriters couldn’t have written any more dramatic and painful.
Rich is the voice and ambassador for us Jets fans, he’s one of the few things we actually have. I unfortunately I hope as I always do because I have to. Last night I could tell that everyone in that stadium thought we couldn’t win that game without him but we did. I lost my voice trying to get the section to realize we have the best D and Run game in the league. Zach Wilson was making decisions last night that I haven’t seen him make ever. I had hope last night and I still have hope because I have to.
At this point I gotta ask, what did the Jets do long ago to deserve this.  Did the owner make a deal with the devil to win that one Super Bowl, and since then has been paying the devils dues?
womp womp womp  woooommmmp
I must admit i was very upset my team lost. Seattle is mine. But after seeing Rich here im feeling much better. thanks bud. oh and sorry.
Reminds me of the Eagles losing Randall Cunningham for the season on opening day in 1991. They had a legendary defense, but the offense just couldn't do it.
Props to Zach for hanging in there, even after the pick.
It’s official the Jets are cursed 🤦🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️
Dam feel sorry for rich. Coming from a Titans fan I know the pain of sucking year in year out
That Vinny story just wow. jet fans in the words of Kendrick "it's going to be alright"
As a niner fan, knowing how your soul can get ripped out of you due to a quarterback getting injured u feel for the jets fan base.
I figured Roidges would get injured this year but never expected this to happen so soon. 15:23 Bad O-line, that's how you got there.
Your old a-hole friend from ESPN tweeted laughing saying this was because Aaron didn't get the vax.
Hey, Rich pull the Michigan card one Michigan man to another
LOLOLOLOOLLOLOL
as a comedy fan, it would have been funnier for that to happen on the first snap...
The last playoff game at Green Bay… my kicker put them out… Robbie Gould… when Brett Favre went to Minnesota and played Chicago, Corey Wooten ended his career.. and last night Aaron Rodgers career pretty much ended by Leonard Floyd… my linebacker.. that’s karma.. it couldn’t have happened to a nicer guy,, You own the Bears but a Chicago Bear ended your last chance at a super bowl and ultimately your career. Own this  mpher
Put a black drop on your left I see so many people walking back there
It’s over for Rodgers. No question. Not rehabbing and coming back from this at 40 years old. Just go into the sunset as the biggest what could’ve been quarterback.
could be a life long lion,s fan...
This freak out is why this is a great show! Sorry Jets fans.
Please invite Jerry Cantrell onto the show to give Rich a hug.
I absolutely love heartbroken sports vents!! I think any fan can feel and empathize with this! Stay true to your JETS Rich! What a shitty start! As a Broncos fan I was glad for you JETS fans!
I wish it was you Rich Eisen.  So I don’t have to ever see you run the 40 again.
.... Sorry Folks
Poor rich eisen . I feel you pain. The league can feel your pain. I am sorry
When he first stood up theybhad a close up of his head n i thought i saw a limp, i was like uh oh is he limping. Then they zoomed out and he was looking towards salah n shook his head one time as if to say you wont believe it.
it's my hope that Aaron Rodgers can guide this kid and jets .
Joe Flacco Time he knows the Jets Selah offense already
Aron Rodgers..... We hardly knew ye 😞
The Jets need to trade him to the Vikings in March
I feel bad for Jets fans but not Rodgers. It’s a young man’s game and he’s made his millions. He was giving his new team what he refused to give his old team the last few years. As a Packers fan I thank him for his efforts and contributions- but he’s no longer a Packer. The Jets fans deserved at least a season of belief and I’m sorry for their loss. Don’t let it affect your love of YOUR TEAM!! 💚
Please dont forget the Patriots traded with the steelers allowing them to jump up and grab Broderick Jones at Left  Tackle 😂
As a Steelers fan, who just got annihilated by the 49ers, I feel really bad for Jets fans. That truly sucks!
This is all Putins fault
Deep down ....... his sould aint agree with that paycut
Do you think some guys were out for blood looking to hurt him...... I remember how Mahomes got hurt last year.....looked like the guy who tackled him was using his full body weight to tackle him......just like the tackle on Rogers.....
What's up with the rise in achilles tears in all sports In the last few years ???  I feel like growing up it was kind of rare  Now you hear about it all the time????
Thats crazy, 4 snaps and the season is over and Rogers career could be as well.
Absolutely gutted. What a way to end it. Left foot planted in the astrofturf. Hopefully he fully recovers, but I’ll be very surprised if he plays again. Devastated.
Big Offensive line fail.
As a Buffalo fan i pray for the players. God bless & Let's go Buffalo 🙏💯🦬💯 We will be fine Von miller is on the way to. There is only one God & that's Jesus. Not football gods.
Very sorry to Rich and all the Jets fans. I know it hurts.
As a Lions fan I thought we were cursed, but the Jets put us to shame. Our prayers are with you Aaron.
The jets are cursed
karma does exist.
The last time I saw Jets fans this upset was when they signed Tim Tebow.
NFL you lost out on a billion in profit with Rodgers in that New York Market. ALL 32 STADIUMS NEED GRASS NEXT YEAR YOU HAVE A WHOLE SEASON TO FIGURE IT OUT
About to play a defense that dominated the Giants…good luck sir.
Four snaps… isn’t that Brett Favre’s number?
Rich I'm a Giants fan who feels really bad for you and all the Jets fans as I was looking forward to seeing them on all those national games
Zach Wilson is too slow in reading the defense before the snap. Jets has a good defense.  Jets will win at least 5 games with defense.  It’s going to be another long season.
As a looong time Jets fan, this might be the most exhausting experience ive had as a fan ... 😮‍💨🫨😶‍🌫️😰😖😫
Being a Bible person...sounds like a curse....Talk to someone who removes curses for good( w/ proven examples)! I recommend Jesus!
Rodgers popped up immediately after the sack. Then he stood there, hands on hips for 20+ seconds, looking over to the sideline… then he shook his head, as to say “can’t believe I have to participate in this theater,” and went down like Peter Griffin after he tripped and hurt his knee…  100% “not real”
Dolphins fan for life.  Always hated the Jets and I am heartbroken by this injury.  Lived near Green Bay for the last decade+ and Rodgers makes the NFL better when he's healthy.
Zach Wilson is probably the worse QB in the league. Yikes
As a fellow Jets fan, this was cathartic so thank you Rich 😂 Our team still has so much talent so I'm holding out hope that we can at least make the playoffs. But damn it still hurts watching replays of that Rodgers injury
Yep, i think as a football fan you never want to see the great ones go down like this. I was looking forward to seeing how it all played out. I figured theyd be damn good potentially great.
Maybe get rid of turf fields ?
So sorry for all of the Jets fans...and Aaron Rogers fans.  Rich, I hope you don't have to wait as long as us Chicago Cubs fans...108 years was way too long...but when it did happen...it felt sooo gooooood!!!! Hoping that your amazing defense can keep the offense in the game...and don't give up on Zach...he selected #2 for a reason.  Hopefully some of AR rubbed off on him!
I was hoping the jets would lose, but not lose aaron on the 4th play. That really sucks
First red flag. Rodgers darkness retreat, brought the darkness to the Jets.
I feel your pain, I’m a Dolphins fan and was really excited to see what the Jets could do with Aaron this year, most fans around the NFL must be gutted ☹️
Josh Allen was the reason the weasel Jets won.
The football gods made a mistake and realized it and gave us a W
I remember when the Jets drafted Sam Darnold and their QB problems were supposed to be "solved" for the foreseeable future.    Yeah...that now seems like it was decades ago...
Jets fans so emotionally damaged. Irretrievably damaged. Brady would DEMAND a better O-line.
Damn Rich, I feel you ....(pause) 😞
This sucks for the whole league
Damn well said Rich. I feel your pain man and I’m a Bronco fan!!! Lol sorry brother
It's wild that the Jets won the game, but still lost. Cause Rodgers is done for the year, probably his career and the Jets are back to mediocrity and searching for a QB.   It was already SB or Bust, cause Rodgers was probably only there for a year. But now, the Rodgers Jets era is over. Insane to see it happen like this.
All that talking all those draft picks just to have Aaron leave in the first quarter and start Zach wilson... should have just saved the draft pucks
0:39 was that the fucking back to the future noise
Damn turf is all i gotta say
Rodgers was damaged goods. He clearly had Covid Leg.
Rich Eisen I feel bad for you 💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔 as a 49er fan I wanted too see how Rodgers looked like in the jets y'all defense is scary asf but we'll never know y'all true potential 💯
everything happens for a reason  and they just deserve it lol
When jet's fans were worried about him getting hurt in the preseason I thought they were overreacting. This does feel like a bad dream come true. Hang in there Jets fans.
Honestly these QBs need more protection like once he's rapped up or unable to make forward progress the play should be dead all the throwing your body weight on someone not going anywhere should be a penalty which would prevent these unnecessary injuries 😒 hoping for a speedy recovery AR8 from a 49ers Faithful California got love for you AR8
I saw a fake spike coming as well!
Jets are cursed.
Wow… the goofy rhetoric surrounding this FAKE injury gives it away as being fake even more than it already looks.
Jets are truly cursed… I think Joe Namath sold his soul to the football Satan to win the superbowl and the jets were cursed for the next 100 years.
It is what it is.  Rodgers is getting old.  It's sad, but let's face it and accept it.  There is always another QB somewhere, you just have to find it.
"Can't stop kicking the Jets in the nards" has to be one of the funniest sport analysis I've heard 🤣
Rich did his best Rich Eisen in this clip. Hilarious. I mean I feel bad for him,  but he’s the best.
Take the week off rich 😅
God saw him in a jets hemet and cursed him
Keep your eye on the ball Rich ! Not over yet buddy !
Rich, Bababooey, Ira The Weatherman, et Al - Commiserations lads 😢
kind of like being a pets fan before kraft,sorry jets fans terrible outcome
Waiting for everyone to remember back to that calf injury Rodgers suffered right at the beginning of training camp doing nonsense drills he wasn't used to doing.
Look, Wilson threw that ball to Wilson who was covered like a carpet by arguably the best secondary in the NFL.  Give Wilson credit for putting the ball where his teammate could make a play.  Any other team we would be pouring accolades on their QB but never Wilson.  Never Wilson.  How come Allen can scramble and throw it away and its a great play but if Wilson does it its boneheaded?
I feel bar for the Jets, and hope Zach balls out this year for their sanity
So sad for Rodgers. What will the Packers do with the second round pick they got next year?
Have u been to a Jets game? These are hardly the woe is me bunch, but bigots and entitled pricks. Poor mexican child and  mom were ridiculed and harassed w racial slurs until security moved them, not the culprits! All for cheering for the opposing team..  Spare me the sorrow. Your tears are delicious. I went to games since the 80s and it was hardly any better.
Tom Brady should at least consider it, I mean the the wife left and you played just one more season?
The hardknocks curse hitting hard
Thank you Uncle Rich.
Three words: b ru tal
Rodgers is done and no first round pick for the Packers. What a way to start the season.
September must be the curse for New York. 9/10 & 9/11 might be the worst days for New York natives and fans.
Sorry, Rich. You're clearly a loyal fan, and events like this require working through the 12 steps of grief. We know it's "just sports", but we get invested in our teams, and it's hard to argue there's a fanbase more mental taxed than Jets fans. At least Detroit fans have some honest hope after week 1. I don't know where the Jets go from here. They still have a really good team, which makes the injury that much more tough to accept.  signed,  -A fan of another snakebitten team
As a non Jets fan I’m gutted and sick to my stomach. Jets fans deserve better, I was pumped to see that team continue to trend upwards.
Jets are cursed
I love watching Eisen cry like a bish.
Packer fan here.. I feel for you Jets fans! I was really wanting Rodgers to play through the season for you guys.. not because of the draft pick.. I’m one of the Packer fans that actually likes Rodgers.. I was really hoping to see how this team did.. I’m totally bummed!
Never wish this on a player...Feel safe bad for A-aron...I was looking forward to seeing you guys have a very productive season...
Well Im a Dolphins fan lol.. hey bro tough love but New York still has ALOT OF TALENT!
Let’s hope that he just had a partial tear or just tendinitis ( small partial tears)
I feel so bad for Rodgers, Rich and all Jets fans... but I have to admit when this happened I thought "We are going to get a great segment tomorrow". Sorry Rich :(
Rich Eisen went full Rachel Maddow on us... the brother took the scenic route to get to the point of what do the Football Gods Want!
I am not a JETS fan.  I am a fan of Rodgers.  I lived in Chico and was a fan when he went to Butte College.  This sucks.  😢
hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
Maybe this will give Rodger's the time to work on improving the team he owns now. Obviously the Bears need a lot of help.
rich hang in there bro!
Leonard Floyd took the Bills Mafia title too seriously. He killed Rodgers's career!
4 snaps
14:32 They just named all the colts qb's and as a fan don't waste your money  on them😂
Poor Rich. I feel for him. He sounds like a Cowboys fan. Our expression is we can’t have nice things so we can relate.
This means the Jets get to keep there 1st round pick for 2024 draft
FOUR SNAPS! THATS ALL WE WERE ALLOoOoOuuuDdd!  😂
No one wants to see anyone get hurt but when you combine a 39 year old quarterback with a weak offensive line, a less than positive result would eventually occur. Jet things happen to the Jets. Hopefully, Wilson has matured sufficiently to at least the level of Trent Dilfer and game manages the Jets to a better season. Carson Wentz is still available. 54 years and counting.
Win the game, lose the season(s). Defense will keep them away from a good draft position.
I'm getting Silver Linings Playbook vibes from Rich...
It couldn't have happened to a nicer douchebag.  I'm laughing so hard.  Hey Kaaron. YOU DESERVE IT!
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Aaron we hardly knew ye
Retired
The New York Jets are a snakebit franchise
4 snaps and a pop.
I war really excited to see how Aaron could do on this team. There is a single upside I don't see anyone talking about. Packers now only get a 2nd round pick because he won't play 60% of the snaps.
Divisional games are always hard to predict.
I'm sorry, but this is the first thing I thought of last night 😂
I knew Rich would be wrecked by this Rodgers injury.
Did you really think a 39 year old Quarterback with an already bad leg was going to last long with that below average Offensive line? Why didn't the Jets get line help in the off season? Instead they went with a $8.6 Million RB that sat on the sideline? So Jests!
Wentz probably best backup of available QBs,but I'll go with Wilson until you cant
Hooray!  We don't have to give up a first round pick and all it cost us was this season, next season, and potentially the next 50 years!  Yes!!
Matt Ryan is available!
I'm blaming the awful chain Woody was wearing on the bad Karma.
Time to ditch the turf.
Winning can be a hard thing to handle for those not used to it.   Oh yes and by the way, thereare no football gods. There's only One God.   🎶 Jesus Christ Superstar Who in the world do You think You are? 🎶  The son of God,  the son of Man,  a light shining in darkness,  the Savior of the world!  Amen
Offer Andrew Luck $10 million a year for the rest of his life to come back and play football for a year.
Joe Namath made the deal with the devil
The Jets browns raiders & the lions have the worst luck ever😂😂
Bengals fans....we already know. Carson, Joe....
I could not wait to hear Rich react. It did not disappoint. I feel bad for Rodgers, but this is great content.
The reality is there are like 4 or 5 fan bases every year with any hope at a SB win and everyone else has no nope. Welcome to the NFL.
Everybody: We can hear you, Rich. You don't have to yell. Rich: RODGERS TORE HIS ACHILLES! YES I DO!
A horror movie?  What about the Raiders....    Hahaha, are the Jets winning the AFC East? I don't think so!
I've said over and over Rodgers is injury prone and way past his prime time to hang up his shoes and enjoy his retirement...
Vinnie brought his curses
Russell Wilson leaves for Denver :  terrible season Aaron Rodgers leaves for NYJ : snaps his achilles Tom Brady leaves for Tampa Bay : wins Superbowl  I don't know how he does it.
As a Ravens fan, this Aaron Rodgers stuff is so similar to JK Dobbins. So much expectation and hope…  1 game and catastrophic Achilles injuries. Man I just hope their mental health is okay and find a way to recover in time.  This is rough stuff for fans, the players, and football as a whole
So upsetting. I hate that I’ve gotten used to this feeling of disappointment. This one hurts deeper.
That jets one championship looks more lonely every year
Happy Vinny Day Anniversary RE!!
Sounds like the angst suffered by the Lions...
As a Eagles fan I truly feel bad for Jets fans. A long suffering franchise especially at QB. This team is very young and talented, QB was a major weakness and they finally got Rodgers and 4 plays in and season and likely career over for Rodgers. Now it's back to Wilson who played a major part in the Jets collpase last year after a 7-4 start and 0-6 finish. Like I said, I am a Eagles fan and have had our share of hearbreak in losing a QB. Randall Cunningham on a Super Bowl caliber team. In 2017 we of course lost Wentz during his MVP caliber season. Shockingly Foles came in and saved the day, won a SB. Maybe Zach Wilson has improved, learned something from Rodgers. Maybe his demotion lit a fire under him. Maybe this motivates him. Last night the Jets didnt quit. They pulled off a remarkable win. Never gave up. For Jets fans that should give you some hope that all is not lost. No matter what, no true sports fan likes to see anyone injured.
Call Miami get white back here or call the 49ers.  Wilson can NOT start past week 2.
You had hope for a preseason
Football Gods wanted him to be a Packer for life I guess.
If you watch Little dicky you find out that Joe Namath made a deal to devil. That's why the jets are cursed
As a football fan, I was happy to see all the struggling franchises be good this year. Detroit, Cleveland and New York. I so devastated by this news. I feel for the Jets and their fan base and fans like Rich. Totally not fair😞
Actually Aaron had 5 snaps as a jet 🥁🙊🙊😆
Rich is cool but he babbles way too much
Welcome to 2022 San Francisco, maybe the Jets can follow the 49ers playbook from last year!
As a Browns fan…welcome to the party pal!
All the naysayers and whiners don’t know a good thing when they see it.  $75 million for the four most exciting plays in the history of all sports?  It was money well spent! ☺️
You will have to lay Joe Willie Namath at the 50 yard line, cut his chest open and eat his still beating heart!
Love you Rich. I’m still waiting to actually wake up for Monday night football to start. It’s a nightmare
holy hell do I love you Rich. "Football Gods, what do you want from us????"   This is what we have been asking for years to deaf ears. We will never know, they giveth, they taketh, they are benevolent and cruel. The football Gods show mercy, and then none. We will never understand them.
Actually it was 5 snaps...
That's too bad I'm a Patriots fan but did not wish for this. I wanted the Jets to fail fair and square.
This is the rant I was waiting for when I saw that injury last night
This is absolutely brutal man. I’m a die hard Packers fan and 12 is my all time favorite football player. Gutted for him and hope he is okay mentally as well. What an awful situation
Would Tom give up that potato chip money?
turf demons ate another career. Too bad there isn't enough money in football to use grass instead of turf. Oh...
I still would have taken Carr instead. His legs are younger.
I really hate this for Aaron Rodgers. 😢
as an eagles fan,  i am so sorry for the jets
We are truly cursed brothers... He better not go back to the darkness and be there on the sidelines mentoring Zach or whoever and earn his pay check another way!
As a lifelong Vikings fan this really makes me sad I feel so sorry for him and the Jets team
You won, be thrilled
I saw the 1999 injury on TV, Patriots won the game. Tom Tupa was the QB/punter all game.
Dear jets management stop getting older washed up qb from Green Bay! SMH
That's how the 9ers fans felt all last year!
I think that we need to sacrifice a chicken.  But not just any chicken, a rubber chicken.  Rich, get a rubber chicken, build a small sacrificial altar in the studio, tie the chicken to the altar, and drip candle wax on it until it melts (or uses it's safe word).
Poor jets just cant have anything nice
Ha
Can they sign Brady?
Umm. We found out how hard JA17 can choke on it.
Rich has finally lost it, poor guy, it is amazing content though :-P
Best. Fan. Meltdown ever!
I'm a lifelong Dolphins fan, and I genuinely felt sorry for them. That's just terrible.
Jets should stay far away from former Packer star QBs.
💔💔💔💔😢🙏🏽 #8
Richie, what doesn't kill you makes you stronger.  🤢
The fact some Packers fans are cheering this is so damn sad.
the shining reference was hilarious. AXE TO THE CHEST lolol
This could be a setup! Rogers gets hurt for the year and the Packers only get a second round pick next year. Rogers wants to stick it to the Packers! He will be ready next year for sure! Mark these words!
No disrespect I think we need to call Philip Rivers
How's that prognostication for the season working out for people?  This will probably doom any future big contracts for older players.  I'm still rooting for the Jets though!
Frauger has no more desires to play football. Let it go jets fan.
We all know since it is the Jets that Aaron is going to decide to retire now leaving Jets fans hopeless again.  That team has really lacked good drafting and coaching for ages.  The problem is somewhere at the top of that team.  They never have enough to put it together.  Even if Aaron was going to play the full season, no way with that OL they had any chance in hell.  GM probably needs fired alongside the owners of the team need to sell the team.
Is this by chance, Rich? Or was it the Jets fault?????? Aaron is turning 40 this year. He is OLD.   This is what happens to most old bodies. Tom Brady had an insane regiment to stay youthful. Completely stupid decision to hire 39 year old Rodgers. 75 million down the drain.
I’m bummed. I wanted to see what they could actually do. Rodgers gonna see this as a sign that he needs to retire.
This was the greatest Eisen meltdown in history…  And I laughed for 16 minutes and 18 seconds straight.
It's actually 5 snaps if you include his Achilles 😂
Now by Rodgers  not playing  how much money  do the Jets loose.   Rodgers  should  give whatever  he signed for  back. Now can the Jets afford to get another  QB right now.  Can they afford  Carson  Wentz even for the  short term.
A gift from bills. Ending rodgers career !! go bills
when are jet fans gonna realize they"ll never win a superbowl its been fiftey plus yrs namath must of sold his soul for that 1 lowly superbowl
Also let’s not forget the Jets won 🤷🏻‍♂️
Technically 5 snaps, 4 football snaps, 1 achilles snap
The football gods have a sense of humor
You never wish an injury on anybody, especially somebody on the level as Rodgers...BUT(LOL)as a born and raised Dolphin fan I have a confession;  I woke up with the biggest smile on my face when I learned Rodgers got injured the 4th play of their very first offensive possession!    After all the hoopla SuperBowl talk, Zack Wilson is the Jets starting QB, AGAIN! bahahahaha!
People blaming the turf and not the fact Rodgers is 40 is what makes me laugh.
As tragic as this moment is, this has to be one of the best segments. Connecting the dots with the vinny testaverde was well done. Even through the worst circumstance imaginable, rich and the boys deliver
There is a slowmo where you can see it pop. And it hurts.
I don't want to see Aaron anymore. I don't want to hear from him. I don't want to talk about it. I am so fed up being a Jet fan. All I want is a fucking chance
The Jets should not have been playing on 9/11, it was bad mojo from the start. Even if they are located in Jersey.
Jets have 1 of the best coaches in the NFL, they will continue to be disrespected yet Win 10 games imo.
I guess "4 snaps and a SNAP" will take its place among these Jets classics:  "The Butt Fumble", "The Fake Spike", "Can't Wait"...
So three years in a row a player has torn their achilles tendon on that field. (2021 - James Robinson, 2022 - Duwuane Smoot, 2023 - Aaron Rodgers).
I didn’t know rich was a Jets fan
Rich, don't forget that you guys started the Tom Brady era. The Gods won't forgive you for that, only us Pats fans thank you Jets for that😂, on a serious note, what happened to ARod sucks, it's probably a carreer ending situation. That's not the way you want to see a superstar go.
This show was actually hilarious. As a Jets fan I'm feeling a little better now
Maybe it's the best thing that could have happened to the Jets where young Wilson, given a second chance will realize his good fortune and grab the reins and run with it to live up to his potential.
Zack Wilson is happy this has happened to Aaron Rodgers! THAT MEANS WILSON CAN SABOTAGE THE JETS YET AGAIN AND GETS PAID FOR DOING SO! F-I-R-E ZACK WILSON NOW OR S-E-L-L THE TEAM NOW!
Apparently the Jets are just cursed at the QB position.    Joe Namath must've made a deal with the devil all those years ago.  There is no other logical explanation anymore.
This game is the perfect defining game as a Jets fan.    - Go crazy over potential HOF QB getting traded.   - looks like it may not happen.   - news dies about the potential trade.  - time passes   - all the sudden rumors emerge again.   -  buzz starts to grow.  - media is in a frenzy   - trade happens   - media goes ape.  - Jets fans going ballistic   - excitement and hope permeates through fanbase.  - build up to season is immense.   - Rodgers loves being here   - Team rallies behind him  - Has a good showing in preseason   - Hard knocks   - anticipation  mounting   - week 1 arrives   - 4 snaps into the season of 1st drive blows Achilles  - fanbase crumbles, suicide watch begins   - horrid retread backup enters game.  - plays as he's always played, like a rookie.   - Team plays spirited due to loss of HOF QB.   - They win game  in thrilling fashion  - fans are blueballed and can't enjoy win due to trauma.   - Team must now sign another QB.   - misery and depression enters the chat   - season is over   - PTSD also enters chat.  - dangles legs over balcony   - pinches self to try to awaken from horrific dream  - cries self to sleep.   - concludes that his team is cursed and are never allowed good things.   - he is right   - drinks self into oblivion   - debates with self about changing his team   - Lay's head on pillow and says out loud "same old Jets
cool story rich.  now imagine as a JETS fan not even having some of those good years with rex ryan, revis island, BEATING your rival patriots in 2010 in the divisonal PLAYOFFS, etc.   ...... and THAT's what it's like to be a lions fan.  i'm not saying i dont feel bad for jets fans. i really do.  but i just wanted to paint a picture of how much worse it could have been since 1999.
I thank God every day I'm not a Jets fan.
Everything started not with Bill Belichick resigning and going to the Patriots, it started in 1994 with Marino catching them sleeping in their 7 yard line. It's like that play cursed them. And also they should stop trying to be the Packers, didn't they learn anything since 2008? and a message to the 2035 Jets, Keep your hands off of Jordan Love mfers.
Turf is the curse
We can't have nice things.
Hily Crap. Sorry Jets Fans 😢
As a Raiders fan I can assure you The Eisen jinx was in!
Tom Brady did lose A LOT of money when FTX collapsed. That Jets owner needs to back the truck up.
The problem is the OL is even worst than last year. No QB could perform with that OL. Fix the OL an Z. Wilson could prosper. Jets need to bring Jameis Winston, he´ll do great with a better OL.
At this point I think you Jets fans love the misery. 😂
That's a crazy story. 😂
Football God: I aint hard to find ☦
Play like JET 😂🤣
over look is in Oregon
BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!
this gave me 16 mins of joy! nice to see rich going through it LOL. Just need the packers GM crashing through the door, HEREEEEEEEEEEEE'S GUTEY!!!!!!!     I love how he talking about how its possible for zack the leggo maniac is going to be good this year!!!
Yet they insist on that terrible turf.....maybe this will change things!
Man we feel for rich .
Dick Hallorann lives in the book.
Break the curse. Build a stadium in the correct state.
Damn Jets
Wow I feel for you rich .
sweet jesus stop sing talking
Couldn't help but think "wow, what a Detroit Lion-esque situation".
As bad as it is for the Jets, at least you went to and won a super bowl. As a Lions fan we got nuthin...
It’s all on Zach. He has the damn arm he just has to calm his brain down and manage the game and they can win a lot of games with that defense and running game and weapons!
I feel bad for the jets players and coaches..
Zach Wilson looks like a deer in headlamps...😂
Let’s get real . I think a lot of people where waiting for something to go wrong. You cannot make this up. Either way jets season is over.
But do we really know its not Vinny's fault though? lol. Great opening story. Heart breaks for all Jets fans. I was looking forward to a Jets resurgence.
Rich's diatribe reminds me of the screes my dad went on every family vacation when, inevitably, an hour into the road trip, a tire or hose or gasket would blow and end the vacation on the side of the highway. "We are not allowed to enjoy nice things," he'd say, equally despairing and enraged.
Calm down Rich or you'll have a stroke.
This really sucks, thinkin of you Rodgers, and NY. I ruptured mine skating, it was a long recovery and it still doesn't feel the same. Grateful rodgers seems like a spiritually inclined man, hope the decision he makes he's at peace with.
Several million loyal Browns fans(such as myself) find your rant....cute.... someday you may learn what real pain and loss are. I could have Ernest Byner come talk to your fan base if that would help. 😢
Vinny , Chad, now Aaron. Why in the hell do the football gods hate the Jets and their fans. I have been a fan since Broadway Joe. Shows how old I am. This really sux. We know one thing for certain, the Jets defense is approaching the 85 Bears. If Zack can just manage the game, no stupid stuff, run the ball and take shots downfield when necessary, we may be ok
The funny thing about jets fans is the consistency and chorus of their sentiment. On everything.
I've got to admit, this whole situation is a disappointment.    What could have been.   Injuries take a lot of the joy out of sports.  o
If Allen had fake spiked and threw a touchdown I think that whole stadium would just rush the field and destroy it. Sorta like an anti rush the field. Rush the field in sadness and anger 😂😂😂
Don't feel bad. O line was the biggest problem. GM/coaches/owners did A Rod and fans dirty.
This might possibly be the most Jets things to ever happen to the Jets and it’s just sad even if you don’t like them or Rogers
So?
Ok So Conspiracy tiiiimmmeee... Rodgers is rocking #8 and blew his Achilles(Kobe previous number and career altering injury), Testaverde is an honorary captain on the 24th anny(24 Kobe 2nd number) of him having the same injury. I know I'm reaching but the numbers are numbering
The question is can Aaron come back after losing a season of play and I'm sure tons of rehab and play for the Jets? Will he even want to? He'll be 40 or 41 This is just brutal for Jets fans and it looks like the Curse continues
Now the jets are in the same boat as the bears, no q b
😂😂😂
OMG 😮😮😮😮😮
A team is *NOT* ready for a Super Bowl run *WITHOUT AN O-LINE* - Period! But the Jets were so happy to FINALLY have a QB they tricked themselves into overlooking it. Feel AWFUL for Jets fans, just awful. As an Eagles fan, Howie has conditioned us to appreciate the O-line and thank god for it.
O-line is the problem.    Rodgers got hit on all 3 pass plays and did nothing.    Zach played better, and he’ll have to run for his life.
Pats fan... this really sucks!  Was hoping for the most competitive AFC East division ever!  Get well soon AR!
Caleb Williams Sweepstakes got a new contender?
With that o-line? Brady'd be killed
In 1968, Broadway Joe Namath wrote a check with his mouth and guaranteed that the Jets would beat the behemoth of a Colts team lead by the legendary Johnny U.  Later that night, he was visited by the Devil who gave him the opportunity to ensure he'd cash that check and make good on his word.  And all it would cost was his soul and the soul of the Jets franchise for the rest of his life.  And thus, for as long as Namath draws breath, the Jets are fated to be tortured year in and year out.  I now believe this fully with all of my heart. You can't convince me otherwise.   Football god #1: 'So how are we going to torture the Jets fanbase this year?' Football god #2: 'There's always the QB position' Football god #1: 'Of course, but we're really scraping the bottom of the barrel with that one. We need to spice it up somehow, make it feel fresh' Football god #2: 'Wouldn't it be something if we could combine the dissappointment of the 1999 and 2008 seasons all into one somehow??' Football god #1: 'By George! That's it! Get me the line into Aaron Rodgers' mind. I think he's on a darkness retreat somewhere, right?'
Vinny was a rowdy bar customer,a real partier.,much like Gerry Cooney.Great point Rich.,this was great theather,praise to your writers.But this is the Namath SB curse in full force.
Is the field artificial turf...?
Forget all that BS how is Aaron?
The jets are cursed, they will never win another superbowl
After the play.... The look on his face said it all.
what are you whining about? you already have a superbowl win, courtesy namath. i've been a bills fan since nineteen sixty four and have nothing, repeat NOTHING, to show for it. Four superbowl losses. ru kidding? we Bills fans have the monopoly on suffering, including last nite's disgusting display.
Love you Rich. I was right there with you.. exited as hell!
Jets fans... It's a tough break, but you are still contenders
Poor Rich! 🫣
Rich you are a fantastic fan!! JETS…JETS!
did worry about all the uber hype of the last few weeks?? Hubris anyone?//
it was 5 snaps if you count the ACL
Remember when the Jets tried to hide a torn labrum from their own player? Showing him fake X-rays, forbidding him from seeing outside doctors. This is karma. You wanna fix it? You need a new owner.
It’s almost poetic….Edgar Allen Poe poetic.
Hahaahhahahaahahahahahahhahahahaahahaa
Sell the team, change the name, get new colors and logo. Start fresh. That’s the best chance for Jets fans… that or just start rooting for the chiefs or bengals 😂
I'm a Dolphins fan. I love Rich and I feel bad. that being said, the Jets are 1-0 with a great defense.
Rich needed some humbling, so funny. Not the injury, but the pain Rich must be going through 😂 take a seat.
Rodgers looked to the sideline then fell to the ground at exactly 11 19 on the clock 911 can’t make this shh up
Say Rich it's call Karma, helping out Zach because the team threw him under the bus in his rookie season.
I'm sorry for the Jets fans but Detroit knows exactly how it feels.
I had no idea Testaverde was a captain. Really shows the universe has a sick sense of humor 😆
Can you say Carson Weintz 😂
Oh boohoo... Mahomes is daddy
As a former Browns fan, I absolutely understand what it's like to be a Jets fan.
Time to get a chicken ready for Jobu Rich.
Would be nice if you could get Andrew Luck to come out of retirement And work something out with the Colts.   Or Get Zach Wilson to play like Trent Dilfer did in 2000 or like Brad Johnson in 02
I'm thinkin' AR has taken his final snap.
When Rodgers took the field I jokingly said to my brothers "So what do we expect him to start with?  Interception or injury?"  And then four plays later I was defending myself.  "It was only a joke!!"  I did not jinx it though because I had recorded the game and watched it on a delay, so unbeknownst to me I was making my comment an hour after Aaron had already been injured.  I figured the Jets would struggle and not meet expectations with Rodgers playing and I thought it would be amusing to see Rich melt down throughout the season with each loss.  But this?  This is so disappointing after all the offseason hype and coverage.  And this is probably the end of his career and that's a lame way for it to end.  This is pretty much the worst way things could go because if he had hurt himself in the pre-season they might have had time to find another quarterback and now that's almost impossible.
"Just-End-The-Season-JETS-JETS-JETS-JETS!"   Say it loud and say it proud you gangrenous sadists.  If you want this curse to go away you have to appologize and give back the trophy you bought before that superbowl 3 "Win".
GEMATRIA STRIKES AS PREDICTED..
Testaverde is a fucking curse!
I doubt my GOAT will go out like this though, he’ll be back in 2024 with either an MVP or Super Bowl championship mark my words 🤞🏾⏳
😅😅😂😂 "I'm not rational right now."
Sorry for jets fans but it couldn’t happen to a nicer person
As an eagles fan I feel for jets fans... told ur head up guys ur still better than Dallas all around
Giants get smoked by 40 and jets lose their Qb for the year after 4 plays on back to back prime time games. Woooof.
"What do you want from us?"  "Pain"  Feel horrible for Jets fans today, but there's no help on the was from the Football Gods.
I was driving to work at 430am listening to the mother ship on the radio and heard the news. I don't even know you Rich and my first thought was how bummed you'd be brother. I'm about your age and realize the best days of the Jets are still Weeb Ewbank and Joe Nameth many, many, many, seasons ago.
Rich arguing that there really are football gods. And they're mean! They loved TB12, in two different uniforms. But they hate the Jets. They really hate the Jets.  Gotta love the Scatman Crothers tie-in from "The Shining." Scatman should have stayed in Florida, with his raunchy Black velvet painting. And Jets fans should have known better. Stay home!
TRADE:  ---Minnesota trades QB Kirk Cousins to NY Jets for the Jets 2024 1st round draft pick. Minnesota pays Cousins entire  2023 salary.
Pyrrhic.
All of the NY-based / biased Sports media shows are in pain this morning.  Should’ve not hyped it up all off-season
Brady saw that offensive line… he’s not stupid.
Horror movie? bro literally just can’t avoid a routine tackle. pretty simple ngl
Why couldnt this have happened to Russ?
Yeah this is terrible. I think it will help expose the limitations/risks of using "turf". Grass or no football game please. Not worth seeing players lose careers because the turf keeps too much traction when contorting legs on a tough tackle.
This is proof as to why you can’t let organizations waste your time man the packers literally wasted Rodgers prime and he got fed up waiting for them to build great teams around him then as he’s a game away from the superbowl these mfs decide to draft his replacement without even telling him first. They also low balled Devante Adams with their first offer which is another reason Adams decided to leave GB. Rodgers then spends the next two seasons trying to be loyal to an organization that didn’t appreciate him anymore, & clearly wanted to move on, he had to watch the entire world turn on him and call him the bad guy & selfish simply because he didn’t get vaccinated & take a paycut for a team that wasn’t putting pieces around him lmao everybody is blaming every playoff loss on him even though Adams dropped TD passes, Lazard did as well, MVS did as well, Aaron Jones fumbles against the Bucs coming out of halftime. Countless times Rodgers has carried the Packers to a score then proceeded to never even touch the ball again because the defense wasn’t good enough. Mannn I feel so bad for the guy & people always wonder why LeBron and these other stars switch teams…. Some of these organizations literally just want to make their money and have a good product on the field they could careless about an actual Super Bowl & the Packers in my opinion are one of those organizations that just want to keep a consistently good/average team out there they’re not really building to actually WIN NOW   Rodgers should’ve left in 2019 when the 49ers tried to trade for him
Real story should be how overrated josh Allen is … Zach Wilson has outplayed him 2 years in a row. Zach is a number one pick the jets are going to find out if he is the guy or not the guy
We have to sacrafice Tua.
Terrible news for Jets. Aaron Rodgers is one best quarterback playing. Huge loss. Prayers for Aaron Rodgers 🙏
Surprised Joe Rogan didn’t have a fix for Aaron, hopefully Aaron can comeback next year.
This is just unreal. Jets fans, I dont even know what to say
😅😅😅😂😂😂
Yall still think your making the playoffs? Hahahahaha
If the next Conjuring movie ain't about The Jets...
My heart goes out to Rich in these trying times 😔
Should have went with his "gut feeling" and retired, average age of an NFL player 27 years old at 39 Rogers is asking for trouble. League already goes way beyond too protect QB's, I believe giving them an unfair advantage at times. Every other play absorbs contact on every play, by the league protecting QB's so much are they making them soft?
As a chargers fan feeeling for the jets. Injuries suck but I’m wishing you all the best and hope for the rest of the year. I was looking forward to our matchup as well this year. We know what it’s like to deal with injuries too
We are just meant to be miserable.
I hope he never plays again
Us Cleveland fans can relate.  Jim Chones broke his leg in practice just before start of 2nd round nba playoffs vs. Boston in 1976.  Cavs best player now(center) is out and now backup 35 yr. old  center Nate Thurmond must play +30 minutes.  Of course Celtics win  NBA Title that year.  Part of the Cleveland jinx history.
I speak for all Jets fans when I say, I hate this team with such a passion. This team is the source of such pain, misery, and lack of enjoyment of football
Carson Wentz is the only free agent QB I see that could work. But let's give Zach Wilson a chance.
This is why you shouldn't get so invested in being a "fan". Jets fans will live miserable lives for the rest of 2023, all over a quarterback who doesn't even know they exist! Focus on improving your own lives, fellas
Rich, you ask what the football gods want? "Jet fan tears"
As a Jets fan, I'm rooting for the Rams.  Who's house? Rams house!
Aaron Rodgers carrying the flag was cringe
As a die hard Bills fan, I do feel bad for Jets fans, and Aaron Rogers himself, for what happened.  I don't like seeing any player get injured like that.  Hopefully he recovers fully and comes back to play (he is 39 after all, not 29, so we'll see how he does).
Honestly wouldn't be surprised if Rogers just retires, but I think it would be cool if he stayed with the Jets as a QB coach for Wilson.
Despite the injury to Aaron,  What a great way to end week 1,  that sure was not the same old New York Jets. And when Aaron Rodgers went down the old New York Jets would have folded and Josh Allen and the bills would have went out there beat them like always. But tonight, with that Defense and that overtime punt return by the Jets was the NFL's version of an extra ending bases-loaded Walk Off Homerun or an NBA overtime 3-point buzzer-beater,  Turn off the lights,  Game Over.
That Vinny injury was devastating to the team. That was a SB capable team with great coaching.
Are the jets fans dumb enough to fall for the evil gods of football giving them false hope in the same game they end the carrier of the fans savior?    They killed your new QBs carrier, and then let you win the game.   They want to pull the table cloth out from under you guys twice this year not just once like they normally do.  If you get your hopes up again today because of the win last night you deserve the December crush the evil gods of football are sharpening up with your names engraved on it.  Before any Jets "faithful" fall back on their old habits and say "How about your Giants?"(because jets fans don't get to enjoy rooting for their team ever, they have to spend every season hoping the Giants suck too) So the Giants might suck this year,  We earned our way into 5 superbowls and won 4 of them as underdogs.   The Jets bought their way into one superbowl total when they bought the right to pretend they won the trophy and have done what since?   The Jets need to build their own stadium somewhere else and fill it with witchdoctors , shaman , and voodoo priests to try and purge this whammy-hex the jets are doomed to suffer from forever.
Colts fan - feeling it for Jets fans.. d*mn..
Jets fans are whiny
Sorry to Rich and all the Jets fans today. Was rooting for you guys this year. Still will. Hopefully Aaron doesn’t end it like this.
Lions fan you got nothing on us. We have this happen to us for decades
As soon as it happened, I felt so bad for rich honestly lol just pick a new team rich. Stop doing this to yourself
feel for you. being a Browns fan for 38 years I know what you're going through
Jets vs Dallas is going to be something to watch.
NFL scheduled Rodgers to play Mahomes 3 years out of 4 and they never got to face each other. Crazy stat. Mahomes was hurt the first game, Rodgers was suspended the second game and now Rodgers is out for the season so he’ll miss the 3rd as well.
I feel bad for Rich and the other Jets fans to see their hope destroyed so early in the season.  As a Vikings fan, I know hope is futile and Charlie Brown will never get to kick that football.  But at least the Vikings usually give me a season full of hope before kicking me in the nuts at playoff time.  You didn't even get to enjoy the ride from weeks 1-18 which is unfortunate.
Jets just can't catch a break.....
Idk how much longer I can be a fan of this team. It’s like they rip all of my internal organs out of me every year
As a Dolphins fan, I didn’t want to face the Jets without Rodgers. Put our best against their best and see the better team win. That is what sport is about - measurement of athletic achievement on the field of competition. My best to Aaron and hope we will see him next year.
Remove all sharp objects from anywhere near the studio. America needs Rich Eisen.
I know the feeling... Im a Steelers Fan and this season has the same feeling than all the other promising starts that ends in total disaster.  😑 Worse, for some reason we are still hopefull.
There is a good chance a 40 year old is going to get hurt. No surprise.  Now, they need to go get a vet to help Zac Wilson.  Sad way for Rodgers to go out.  Jets, you dont get to have nice things.
This is Karma at its finest. Fraudgers with who he is and the media non stop unwarranted talk 24/7 about a playoff choker and unwarrantedly hyping him up to bullshit levels. This.....this is on the media and Fraudgers and I'm happy right now. You all and this coming and now eat your dinner
What a great way to end week 1,  that sure was not the same old New York Jets. And when Aaron Rodgers went down the old New York Jets would have folded and Josh Allen and the bills would have went out there beat them like always. But tonight, with that Defense and that overtime punt return by the Jets was the NFL's version of an extra ending bases-loaded Walk Off Homerun or an NBA overtime 3-point buzzer-beater,  Turn off the lights,  Game Over.
Amazing.
( laughing in raider fan ) that’s what you get for talking so much mess about the Raiders and their unhealthy QB
Love it. Farve tears his pectoral as a Jet and now this! 👍😂😂
If there was not four turnovers then the Jets had no chance to win...I dont see the Jets doing that great the rest of the season.
Carson Wentz …get it over with
I was hoping the jets would just suck…not this never this
People need to keep a close eye on Greeny and Rich.
You got a total of 5 snaps. 4 plays and 1 Achilles.
Any suggestions on what QB we should target.
Sorry Rich....but Browns fans know exactly how you feel as far as hope goes....we are really hoping again....this year!
Lol try being a Chargers fan … nothing nada and typical failure in pressure moments … 😂
Should have given the Packers the 2024 1st rounder with no conditions. This is the penalty.  Seriously, though, the Jets now have a good team. You just need to be patient and let Zach develop. Look what happened with Jordan Love. He sat the bench for three years, learned the offense and then was handed the reins when he was ready. Same needs to happen to Zach.  Hopefully Aaron will get plenty of rest and let his body heal and makes a comeback next year.
❤️‍🩹🏈✈️🙏🏻
I've been waiting all day for this. Somehow, Rich is the only likeable sports commentator. I'm sorry for his loss
Hello Tom?  This is Joe Douglas, can we talk???
All it takes is one sack in artificial turf to lose your starting quarterback. An O-line that allows their quarterback to be sacked 4 times should all be fined.
Dude how obnoxious is rich
Rich never gets to the point.
Turf needs to be eliminated from football.
I legitimately almost called in today because of what happened last night.  We got invited to a high class restaurant, were told we could order anything on the menu and instead of getting to eat it they gave us a sniff and then took the plate back to the kitchen 😭
i was never a huge rodgers fan but ik how great he is the jets had so much hope for this season and it’s heartbreaking his season ended with little time left
It’s comical at this point lol
It's the turf
Speaking of going back in time.....if the Seahawks lose a couple more games, are the Jets desperate enough to trade for Geno?
Blame Woody Johnson for building a terrible turf.
It's so hard to be a Jets fan.  For me, it's 52 years of nothing but suffering.  Rich, you nailed it.  And I'm happy to join you in paying off the football gods.
Dude… the eerie connections just solidify my suspicions of the jets just being cursed.. for some reason they just are.. I wonder how long before they can succeed as a franchise..
I remember Jet fans cheering like crazy when Tom Brady tore his ACL back in 2008. Have zero sympathy for them. Hope Aaron gets better soon though and gets the hell out of New York.
The Football Gods want that ill-gotten Superbowl III trophy back.
Rich, the Jets drought will grow to 55 years & counting this year. The Jets can't have nice things.
Rich goin through it rn. He looks like he’s trying not to snap 😂. RIP Super bowl hopes.
Jets trying to buy a championship instead of growing from within.  Getting a HOF QB and all the players he wanted....smh.
Maybe the Jets can use old QBs like relievers in baseball...sign Rivers for a game, then Brady, then pull Wentz in to play against the Eagles, etc.
Quit your damn whining Mr. Eisen!! The New York Jets have won a superbowl in their past. Yes it was a long time ago but it did happen!!! There are other fan base's out there who havent had that experience. I've  watched the Browns since Don cockroft and Bryan Sipe were playing having my heart broken every year!! WE lost the team to Baltimore for a few years after Art Model moved them. It could be worse atleast the New York Jets still exist!!! What if they moved the team to Iowa or somewhere What Then?? You atleast have 2 NFL teams in New York. Yes it was heartbreaking watching that happen to Aron Rogers and I hope he can come back next year and renew your hopes for the team.
I hated seeing Rodgers get hurt and was looking forward to seeing what he could do with a talented Jets team but I admit watching this beta male scream, like the child his is, is a reasonable consultation. The  Jets didn’t win this game. Allen lost it. They will win but this will be another disappointing season unless they work out a trade for a competent QB. That’s probably all they need.
Rich you are funny.  Amongst all the disparity  over  Rodgers. The Jets defense  played  great,  and rattled Josh Allen.  And the offense  Bills. So there is still  hope.  The Bills  can be beat. The Jets can  play like this  all year who knows.   Jets QB  needs a bit of time.  Next week is a  different  week.
Sell the team
Not a Jets fan but the news was such a huge downer to what has been a great start to the season. The Jets CANNOT move forward with Wilson. He is hopeless. They need to find a QB that can move the ball downfield and they might still have a chance to do something great.
I was waiting on eisen
Carson Wentz is the best UFA option, for the record.
Being a Jets fan must be like being a Suns fan....too bad for the Fans, Rodgers and the Jets.
The fact that it happened on 9/11
Sorry Jets fans that is heartbreaking and isnt fair. That said, your organization is the problem. They knew the risk of an older QB, they got him weapons to get the ball to but no one to protect him. So many sports casters and analysts figured it wouldn't be that big of a problem due to how fast Aarodge could get the ball off. That O-line is terrible.   So go get Brady or whoever else; but you are just kickin the can down the road for the real problem.
This just makes me appreciate Tom Brady even more. He knew how to protect himself really well in the pocket and especially when being sacked.
This ought to be rich😂
Covid went and snatched Rodgers Achilles heel.
no mercy for Jets fans   hey Carson Wentz is free lol
Lifelong Pats fan, HATE the J E T S Jets.  But this is too much. Not fair.  You did everything right.  ARod did everything right - even gave a Bradyesque new-hometown discount. Everything.  Well, everything except give the starting o-line ANY reps in preseason. But still, I'm not gleeful about it - it's just too much.
It is called getting rid of the artificial turf and start putting in grass
This is karma
The Trey Lance trade was the worst in NFL history... Jets: HOLD MY BEER!
Technically there was a 5th snap. It was his Achilles.
Speaking of the football gods, this schedule.. if the Jets could have drawn the Giants or Cardinals or even Broncos or Vikings but no, they get what might be the best defense this decade. Poor Jets.
Forget it, Hes with theRaders , dreams over.
Over
Now he can “OWN” - retiring!
The Jets should invest in a grass field.
Honestly. I'd try to trade for Davis mills
As a life long Cowboys fan, who vividly remembers Broadway Joe's Superbowl prediction and spectacular win, I was truly looking forward to next week's game with Rodgers at the helm.  Now, if we win next week I'll have no joy in the victory.  I truly feel bad for Rodgers and the Jets.
I feel so bad for Rich honestly, what a gut punch man
I downloaded Roku so I can watch this live😂
Maybe they can convince him to be a QB coach for the rest of the year?
This Jets team would be SCARY good right now with Trevor Lawrence.
55 years ago, Joe Namath made a deal with the devil. That's why he was able to guarantee the Jets winning the superbowl. Fame and fortune also came with it. However, the curse side is that the Jets will not win a Superbowl while he is still alive. It's the only reasonable explanation for the Jets horrible fortunes for this long.
I never wish for any player or person to get injured.  But I don't feel sorry for anybody in this situation.  Annoying overhyped arrogant fan base.  With an arrogant QB.  Who thought that all you had to do was do ayahuasca and go in dark rooms to be ready for the NFL season. He's 39 years old and didn't change his training didn't train harder didn't do anything to get better knowing he had a terrible offensive line.  I don't feel sorry for anybody in this situation.
Cowboys fan, was too hyped for next week, what a bummer!
Rich Eisen, you had me in hysterics. Sad for AR but your first 7 minute rant of that was hilarious
I really feel bad for you Rich. You had a lot if not all your eggs in the Rodgers basket. I hope your Jets can make some sort of recovery.
If the Jets didn't have bad luck they wouldn't have any luck at all.
We love you Rich I am absolutely gutted about rodgers. We will never know what could’ve been. It is a crime against all football lovers that we won’t see it.
13:51 Rich, you have no fuckin balls.
David zazlov predicted Roger's torn achilles the day before 😮
Are dick pics still a thing? Maybe AR can still contribute like Favre did.
Don’t worry Rich the Jets are actually a very good and young team.It’s unfortunate what happened to Rogers but I think they’re going to have a pretty good season anyway, the future is very bright with the Jets.
Crazy vinny was at the coin toss and look at what happened to rodgers
Wolfman gots nards
respec to the audio guy who anticipated the need for a decent compressor to prevent things from getting out of hand
Patriots fan checking in: lololololol
Rich please bring Larry David on the show. i need to know.
Why did the Jets signed a 39 years old QB in the first place ? Rodgers will never play in NFL anymore.
Scary coincident 😢
If the jets would admit they fixed superbowl 3 the football gods would stop shoving telephone poles up there butts like this.
its the Jets QB that sold his soul’s fault. hope that one ring was worth it
All Rodgers did is give Jet Fans hope, where did I hear that before.... I`m a Packers Fan.
The video I have been waiting for lol I immediately thought of rich when this happened.
One of Kubric's best. Sorry, Rich. I'm a Lions fan. I can relate but not this year.
Colts fan here. Just wanna say good luck the rest of the season to you guys and that loyal fan base. Watched hard knocks and saw a lot to like. Tough break but who knows, maybe this will be the opportunity Zach needs to show why he was a #2 pick.
I can feel all the Rich's pain. It's real.
Terrible to see. And amazing how history repeated itself so well…maybe in the future the Jets shouldn’t trade with the Packers.
But...how did AR and the Jets look on those 4 snaps?
Am I the only Jets fan who wasn't surprised at Rodgers' injury as it happened?  Part of being a Jets fan is knowing that whatever can go wrong, will go wrong.. We're not allowed to have nice things
It’s really devastating, Jets are right back where they were last year. Great defense and don’t let Zach Wilson be a real QB.
this is karma coming to roost to the prima donna kaaron rodgers
The goddamn Jets, man. You poor bastards just can't catch a break 🤣 💯
Even as a Pats fan who hates the Jets and enjoys crushing them twice a year I feel bad. I was looking forward to an actual competitive game. The Jets defense is still amazing but Wilson just isn't the answer. Gonna be a long year for this team
I'm a Cleveland fan. Keep your head up Jets.
Maybe the Jets can get Sam Darnold
Let the kid play.
Hate to see it ;)
As an Angels fan I have so much empathy for Jets fans right now.
Having hope is a beautiful burden to hold
The best snap of the game 😂
Well back to the green drawing board.
The jets should go back to what ever they are officially calling Shea Stadium 2 and stay in that automotive junk yard with the rest of the junk that doesn't work anymore.     If the Giants were the only team in Giants Stadium 2 we would still have the grass tile system.
Rich speaks for us all. 😔
Your a jets fan. You can't have nice things 🤣
After the COVID stuff, i was DONE with Rodgers and his ARROGANT attitude
Bills fans got Jets fans beat in misery, and it's not close. 😔
Rich referencing The Shining and then doing his own Kubrick stare at 14:30 was too good.
If I have a choice between head or tail, I choose head every time. 😉
Soooo much pain in his voice and eyes. Poor guy. Coming from a lifelong Raiders fan, I get it brotha! lol
Speedy recovery, Mr. Rodgers. Heart breaking...
As a Lions fan I feel your pain
Great stuff from Rich.  That's how passion can take you to the next level!
Damn someone really f d up with the football gods sheesh 😥
With this type of injury and Aaron's age, i think he's played his last game! Very sad!
Can we get darnold back?
From a Raiders fan i feel for the Jets fans man that was a terrible break
Been waiting for this.
I wanna feel rich eisen pain I really do, but he is cracking me up 😂😂😂😂
Broadway Joe had a huge ego and was not a great team mate. The jets did him wrong and will pay for it, you know this Rich. No matter his personality issues, he is the one who guaranteed the win and delivered. Should have embraced the Liberace type persona, sucked it up and shown NY toughness and the gods would have been grateful.  You know Joe was cold shouldered for possibly good reasons. Rich, you have to make amends or you will live in this pain forever.
Now the AR drama is over.   But there may be some positives for the Jets. Go ahead and play your game.  Good luck  !
Rogers going to the Jets, getting injured on the 4th play, Brett Favre wore #4.... Rogers to Vikings 2024 confirmed.
Actually you found out what happens when an opponent gives ya four turnovers in a game... For these Jets, that means a walk-off special teams play in overtime.  Good luck with that.
Comment mostly for the algorithm as a fan of the show.   Not a Rodgers fan. Not a hater. Just, not a fan. Dont want to see anyone hurt. So, sorry to all you Jets fans. And I hope he does come back. Being 40 and he himself saying hes like 90% retired. Maybe he calls it. Or does maybe one season and done. Either way, not even being a fan I'd like to see him go out on his own terms.
As a NY METS fan I’m so sorry jets fans…
That was a great character win for the Jets last night. After Eagles and 49ers they have arguably one of the best rosters. If Zach Wilson can be self less and get serious here he can very well manage the game and run that double headed back field into the playoffs.
🤣🤣🤣 Poor Rich he lot mind...Love Him.
I was really looking forward to seeing the Jets bend over the Cowboys. Now I'm praying for the Jets. Dammit. RIP.
My heart goes out to you Rich! Wish you could have had a better season!
I have nothing to say other than..Rich...I am so so so sorry
Now you can stop talking about them.
I don't feel sorry for Rich? The Jets is the Jets! Intercepteverde jinked them.😢
Thry just need a consistent QB..and a new field
It would be the ultimate shot at Rodgers if Tom Brady came in and took the Jets to the Super Bowl. Won’t happen, I doubt Tom wants to play behind that offensive line, but it would be amazing.
I'm Gutted.
I knew Rich would deliver. At one point I saw his eye start twitching like Chief Inspector Dreyfus'
Wow…
As a Lions fan, I have always been a fan of Rodgers while also hoping the Packers lose every week. I was pretty excited to finally root for him and his team. I'm so sorry to him and Jets fans. Maybe Wilson will surprise us all and have a great season.
"The Jets can never have nice things"  Rich Eisen.
Joe Thiesman
Well at least the Bills gave ya a thrilling win … 🤷‍♂️
Rich was so excited for this year 💀💀
I feel for Wilson, he went out there and helped the jets win the game.  He's far from as talented as Rodgers, but it's gotta be annoying winning a game and the media is trying to credit Rodgers for teaching him during the offseason
We might never see Rodgers play against Mahomes at all. That’s devastating.
Rich was the first person I thought of when Rodgers got carted off
I’m sorry Rich, that’s brutal bro
Rodgers a great Regular season quarterback.
this really sucked. Time to call Sam Bradford.
As a Bengals fan i was feeling really bummed out, but at least i'm not a Jets fan. Hope you can overcome this Jets.
What a way for Rogers to go out
I’m not a Jets fam, but I’m very sorry to see this happen. I was looking forward to seeing this team playing this year.
Josh Allen has more pass to Jets players in this game then AR did!         Great Win for Jets fan !       Good Therapy for Rich E.      ;-)
Yep, it's all about you Rich...
Sorry Rich  I guess the gods may know something we don’t, let’s hope their is a Saviour round the corner for ya.
In resume Jets are gonna Jet
Totally sucks the life outta the whole season, all that hype
and those 4 snaps were all bad.
Rich! I feel for you and all Jets fans! Hope the season isn't totally gone. As a Niner fan I know what that feels like in recent years...
rich i am a pats fan but i am sorry about rogers injury. i was looking forward to see him in the afc east division.chris carten
Grass...
Jets are truly cursed. The bills ended the career of yet another packers legend lol. They ended bret Favre too forever scrambling his brains. Sorry rich the jets are finished
Hey Rich... Rodgers will retire undefeated with the Jets when he starts the game! That's something!   I feel bad, man. I'm a Mets fan, I know the feeling of having expectations and then going out the window after the first pitch of the season.
Big Browns fan here and feel AWFUL for you Jets fans - so wanted to match up with you guys at full strength....
As a chiefs fan im so bummed for Aaron, Saleh, the whole team, and especially Jets fans. I was so excited to see Mahomes vs Rodgers in a few weeks. Im sorry Jets fans, you guys deserve better.
these themes also apply to the Browns. So I can empathize.
Jets fans are not allowed to have nice things ……ha ha ha
We need to get DP to hold intervention
The football gods Thanos snapped Rodgers out of existence. 3 plays, one snap!
Wayne Chrebet and Keyshawn Johnson were an awesome WR due lol
I’m a saints fan, and I honestly do just feel horrible for the Jets. They finally had a glimmer of hope for truly competing again the AFC, and in four plays it completely went away. The Bills were not the bearer team last night, and had Rodgers played I honestly could've seen this being a blowout.  Truly pulling for them to continue to do well.
Aaron22 was cucked
I didn't sew that coming 😕!!! I DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING!!! I  said, "AAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWW, NO.....I don't believe this. Rogers can't be hurt. Ahhhhh.  No!!!"
all I can think of on this situation is that the Football Gods has the same smiling face from the Jim Carrey Grinch movie.
He threw the ball at an opposing player after he went down. Be thankful he wasn't whistled for unsportsmanlike. Imagine if his final stat line was NEGATIVE 15 YARDS for his 2023-2024 campaign.
Rich needs to accept this ride and enjoy the roller coaster this season is about to be after that epic win.
I feel for you Rich
This had nothing to do with the Football Gods or the stadium turf.  Lots of people were talking about the dangerous of putting a not so mobile 39 years old QB behind a terrible OL. I mean, the guy on the OL covering the QB blind size is as old as Rogers.  The only people that didn't want to see this were Jets fans.  A great QB doesn't make a team.  They went and spend money on another RB instead of getting OL help.  When managers and coaches of NFL teams are going to learn that a great QB alone is not enough?  So sad for Rogers, and as a Dolphins fan, sad also for Jets fans.  They deserve better.  They were lied, they were not going to the SB without OL. Not even with Rogers.
Jesus relax Ricky - think positive and good things will happen. Getting to the wildcard was the best you could have hoped for w/ Rogers. Zack will struggle but if you are 3 and 2 after the first 5 games - the jets have a chance to make it to the playoffs!
Who didn't see the Rodgers injury coming? He turns 40 in Dec. He's not a fitness fanatic like Brady. He looks 40. His body looks 40. Everybody was sure Rodgers was going to elevate the Jets to elite level. But I doubted he would make it through the season without injury. But I didn't know it would happen 4 plays into the season.
I love how its the "turf" lol
As a Browns fan, I send my regards to all Jets fans. Just terrible. I was really excited for The Jets and was rooting for them to be good. Seems like our teams are just cursed smh 🙏🏾
I was 14 years old and I watched Bryce Paup tear Randall Cunningham's knee in 1991. The Eagles were going to win it all. I knew it. As a kid - i'll never forget that day. This brought all those memories back.
I really wanted to see Aaron come to Gillette and get smacked, sorry jets fans. Go pats tho
12-8= 4  4 plays 4 Favres number who tried to do the same thing as a Jet 4 days spent in the retreat  Spooky I’m telling you
Bein a DIE HARD Raider Fan, I Feel your pain brotha….  I know what its like but the unfortunate answer and unfortunate thing for guys like us to do; is stay loyal to the soil lol
If you root for The Jets its because you hate yourself.
They still beat the Bills though speaking of misery
BAHAHAAA J.E.T.S  jets jets jets are still cursed.  Go PATS ! sorry Rich
Those days of Bill Parcels and Vinny Testaverde with Curtis Martin. I used to root for the Jets back then, just like I do for Josh Allen, my second favorite QB after Justin Herbert. See my pain as well. Most of us feel like masochistic.
I feel for Jets Fans. But as a professional Aaron Rodgers Hater, this is too hilarious not to revel in. Maybe Joe Rogan has some advice for him? HAHAHAHA  🤣🤣🤣
There was a ton of arrogance all spring coming out of Jet nation, especially toward Green Bay nation. That included Eisen here. It sucks for Rodgers if this is how it ends. It sucks for his teammates and coaches who got a taste of what a real qb is. The fans? Can't say they really deserve much empathy with their paper champ hysteria. It's kind of fitting that Garrett Wilson was running free on a first down play and ARod ignoring him and not taking what was given. Your top weapon in the passing game, but it wasn't challenging enough for Rodgers. It's a play Brady made a career out of, won a few SB's with, played into his mid 40s with the boring check downs. And it's a play Rodgers passed up many times even in the biggest spots, because he outthought himself. The football gods are telling you to shut your mouth for once, Rich.
Rich, as a Chargers fan, I can only empathise with your perpetual suffering.  Our two teams' paths may be different every year but the destination is always the same.
Jet fan should have look for trap door.
Hopefully Aaron is in Zachs ear all season, lean on the run game which looked really good and ride that defense. It sucks but it's not over for the Jets.
Isn’t it a little weird that this happened basically on the anniversary of that other injury? The same thing happened to Alex Smith on the 30th anniversary to the exact day of Joe Theisman’s injury.
The video of this game should be in the dictionary as definition of “pyrrhic victory”
... As Leonard Floyd (Ex-Bear) destroying Aaron Rodgers(Ex-Packers)...
Football gods don't like the Jets. So sad.                   PEACE
Rich, I feel ya man. Maybe not quite as bad, but I've been a die hard Bears fan for 40 years.  The deep feeling that our teams will just never get it right, no matter the situation.  Sorry brother
Perhaps the greatest monologue of all time
Wilson sounds like a grown man now, at least.
The Football Gods are indeed fickle. Signed a Chargers fan.
What type of horror film ??? Is this more like The Ring, or Texas Chainsaw Massacre, or The Babadook? Or maybe Night of the Demons? 🤔🤔🤔
How long before fans start calling for a trade for Trey Lance?
He has warned and warned and warned the NFL about the turf. And now the Turf Moster got him. It's so unfortunate. Wish he had just stayed in Green Bay. The Curse of The Jets is real.
Jets losing rodgers on 9/11 is really fucked up
😂
at least jet fans will always have hard knocks to remember rodgers as a jet. lol wow
Rich, does somebody need a tampon? You were fooled. Jets fans were fooled. NFL fans were fooled. I wasn't. The Jets have no hope.
Dude, the Jets are the George Costanza of the NFL!
I feel for you Rich, and believe me as a 60 year old Detroit Lions fan you have a brother franchise in the NFC
I've said for years, the NFL should disband the Jets. Not even sell/rename, just disband this caldron of bad luck losers. After 50 years, all that is memorable about this team is screwball Joes mink coat.
The Jets signing a future Hall-of-Famer to an elite roster and getting him to sign a sweetheart deal only for him to get injured on the 4th play of the season is the most Jets thing that could have possibly happened.
When 8 didn’t get up right away, Rich was the first person I thought of. Just brutal.
Arod and the Scatman... twinsies.
Hahaha. Serves him right. When you are a jerk, a selfish person. Karma comes back around again. I hate it for the jets and the fans. Not for Aaron. He’s 40, shouldn’t have left green bay.
Hahaaaaaaaaaaa
This karma for overhyping an athlete and making him bigger than the game. Jets can still overcome, you didn’t need Rodgers. You showed that against a great Buffalo team.
Jets are cursed … lol … And MetLife field is the worst in the nfl … how many more ppl need to have serious leg injuries before they change that field to grass
Bright side… at least y’all have Allens number
Hahahah jets are garbage
Team is snake bitten my goodness u cant make this up as a die hard jets fan for over 30 years this rodgers injury hurts alot just hope we can rally behind zach and make the playoffs. Smfh
Jets should trade for Jameis Winston...lol
Vent it, Rich!  Get it out, Bud.
Poor Rich 😢
As a Raiders fan... I understand. 🫡
Man sorry Rich - Clippers Fan
Sonny Jurgensen blew out his Achilles the season the Redskins lost to the Undefeated Miami dolphins 14-7.   What could have been...
As a Bears fan - I've always thought of the Jets as our AFC brother...
As a packers fan, I get sick to my stomach every time I see a clip or photo of that play. I really hope Rodgers can recover and play again if he still finds that fire inside through all the rehab. No true fan wants to see the trade end like this. Praying for him and all the jets fans 🙏🏽
Damn I was so happy for the Jets and excited for their season. Broke my heart as a Niners fan
No way to sugar coat it...a major gut punch to the Jet's faithful.
The Bills took out Aaron Rogers like Brock Purdy got took out by The Eagles in the NFL  Championship game . THE FOOTBALL GODS DECIDED NO SB THAT YEAR.  I totally sympathize with you.
the reason in metamedicine for an Achilles tendon rupture: Did I want to get away from my family roots to get on in my own way. Well, we all know what family roots Aaron wanted to break away from with this new start. The Packers. :(
Could this be defined as the Jets “Chargering”?
Just shows, any play, any moment, can change a life, a team, a city. 😔
Need to change the name the show to the Rich Eisen Torture Chamber
360p is the only option lol!!!  what kind of rinky dink S show you running over there
What do Aaron Rodgers & Kevin Bacon have in common? Footloose.
I really feel bad for Rich, he was so excited that his team is finally turning the corner. But I can’t not help but laugh, too entertaining.
Hoping for a classic Rich Eisen Jets rant!
I think that a guy named Stevie Wonder wrote a song a long, long time ago, especially dedicated to the Jets fans. It goes like this " Very superstitious/ Writing's on the wall,/Very superstitious, Ladders bout' to fall".  What happened to Aaron Rodgers last night is simply unbelievable. Not to mention, we were, of course, on 9/11. Talk about a curse. Sad news, really.
zero chance he doesnt retire
I was SO looking forward to watching Rich, Greenie, etc. struggle to hold it together after a 2-3 start, or a couple of bad losses, or any of the other hiccups that present themselves when you try to mesh a newly arrived late-career HOF QB with an ascending roster.  But I was most certainly NOT hoping for anything like this.  I honestly feel sick for Aaron, the Jets, and their fans.  I very much hope that fortune turns around for this team at some point.
Dilfer and Flacco won Super Bowls for a reason. A good defense and a serviceable QB can make it happen
Jets fan here, therapy for my soul, thanks rich
Rich has been gassing this dude up for so long, just to have him blow his season on the first drive...  New idea for the next Over Reaction session: anyone (team or player) that Rich Eisen supports wholeheartedly is doomed to fail, horrifically
I heard Dan Hanzus tell the 99 story last night. Just brutal, I’m so sorry to all the Jets fans.
We knew. The whole time we knew it was all too good to be true
Jets should make a move for Drew Lock... He's basically QB1B in seattle and a lot better than people think.
Reality really can be stranger than fiction.
Rich sounds like he was up late drinking whiskeys lol
This injury has validated my belief in God.
I see this video is 16 minutes long, so I'm wondering if there is some concern that by taking up so much air time to gush about Rodgers he might have influenced this outcome... At the very least this part is now fun to watch.
Feel for Rich bro. Really like the show was excited to see how he’d be with a good/great Jets team..
Rich is gonna need more of that red "medecine" he had last night! 😄
Condolences Rich and fellow Jets fans, but hey, maybe they can hang tough with that defense and running game. They still have enough to be a playoff team
Silver lining…… they keep their 1st and it’s a good year to draft a QB…..😊
Unbelievable man.  The only positive thing that came out of tonight is that Breece Hall appears to be better than ever before.  If Zach Wilson can just be an average QB we can make the playoffs.
:((
To be the fly on the wall in the Rich Eisen household when the injury happened would be something special.
Nailed it!😢
Jets owners decided to save money by going with the green turf.
Rich always makes me smile.
J - E - T - S! Cursed… Cursed… Cursed… Cursed… ☠️☠️☠️☠️
I don't feel good about this but, I've been looking forward to hearing Rich's reaction since the 4th minute of the game last night.
Sorry for Aaron and Rich. 😢 wish AR speedy recovery
A jets fan would never feel bad for another fan base. Don't feel bad for them
Putting your faith in a 40 year old qb not named Brady is insane... it was even insane for Brady he just did it.. dude had a bum calf, horrible O line and refused to follow a 3 step drop. .. shocking
Just sucks, man and I say that as a Bills fan. Wishing ARod and Jets fans the best.
Sorry, Rich Eisen.
As soon as it happened all I thought about was how upset rich must've been
I’m so sorry rich
It’s terrible when a player, any player, gets hurt…  but shooting straight, as soon as Rodgers went down I was looking forward to Rich’s take
I feel for every Jets fan (from a Seahawks fan) Brutal ...
I want to see, if Aaron Rodger can summom his inner Alex Smith and rehab hinself back onto the field. I have my opinion, which is ... totally unimportant.
Rich I thought of you and Greeny during the game. I was worried about the both of you.
Rich, I’m so sorry dude.
Welfare Check on all Jets fans
Im be a jets fan Since I was ten years old and i'm fifty five years old now and it brake my heart
Brockman is gonna be ruthless Week 3, Pats vs Jets and I can't wait GoPats
And now ya have Wilson going against that Dallas D yikes
This was terrible to all sports fans. I wantedt to see the Aaron Rodgers eea played out. Nobody wants injury' to maybe end it permanently
Just dropping in to tell all jets fans how sorry I am. Really hope you guys find a way to overcome this and maintain a solid level of play that enables you to go to the playoffs, even without Aaron under center. You deserve all the best!
My condolences rich sincerely !
Somehow all 3 New York teams lost this weekend
It’s going to be ok Rich
Brutal
Rodgers lasted as long as a virgin on his honeymoon
I think it’s gone as well as any Jets fan could’ve hoped for; Aaron Rodgers did indeed play his last football game in a Jets uniform!
