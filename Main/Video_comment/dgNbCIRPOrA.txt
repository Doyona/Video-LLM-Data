Those chickens are honestly demon spawn from Spawn of Bogdo. Nothing will convince me otherwise.
omfg i can't believe i didn't think of the flock tactic
3:49 i was dying of laughter
1:16 the opportunity was right there to say "oh he's a Fall Guy's player"
3:55 top rope??? Like grefgore from hit dnd podcast just roll with it??
why did you get more glitches than me also im doing that ship glitch
i like to call the grawkas "rainbow murder chickens" even though they only come in 2 colors. one time i was standing on a cliff just admiring the scenery after obliterating the surrounding plantlife for seeds, and a rainbow murder chicken saw me and said "random ginger guy on my cliff? i think the FUCK not" and just fucking headbutted me right in the legs and almost sent me off the edge of the cliff and i said out loud, "THIS IS WHY WE CAN'T HAVE NICE THINGS"  also Calcium Kestis is one of the absolute funniest things i think i've ever heard in my life xD Cal is short for many things, mostly Calcium and Calamity
Rick didn’t die when he was pushed off of the cliff, he just fell into a new save file
“Did the beast of the bog just come in with a fucking drop kick?”  The sheer incredulity of his delivery makes me cackle every time.
star wars: ginger underbite  is my favorite game
At least this is not a chicke-AAAAHHHHHH
“Milkdalorian”- slimecicle 2023
I like valorant
Barely a minute in and I hear “cock trooper” 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I only just realized like 2 years after this was posted that the music that plays when Charlie first discovers the power of the space chickens (1:55) is "All Hail Shadow", specifically the version that plays after Mephiles' Whisper
for being just space chickens, Rawkas have no business being able to absolutely body Cal the way they do
😂 3:49 😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂bro😂 I 😂just like 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I used the same exact strategy
i was convinced rick the door technician was made up as a joke for this video, but he's an actual CHARACTER IN THE GAME??
This video is now 2 years old
I knew it was over as soon as he said grandmaster
4:27 this is why I choose to join the gorilla and not fight it with the other 99 men
9:34 ohh, a shortcut😂
Spi-der
8:57 HOW... THE. HELL.?
6:41  Bros cooked
Rick nooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!
Can we please have an extended version of the Slime Wars theme
late to the party but what were ur graphics settings bc it looks so much better than the highest fucking ones
Rick the Door Technician cannot be stopped.
I’m so glad I’m not the only one who despises those space chicken.
I always come back 11:54
There an achivement for dropkicking enemies with a mullet
Rick The Door Technician solos Soldier of Godrick, ong
Bro is running Windows 11???
"bro just evaded life" 😂
3:00-3:20 this whole bit. 😂😂😂
Its what happens when storm troopers get a change of heart 2:34 sadly rick still dies in every timeline
I can't believe hes still using a mouse
The fact the beast of the bog can pull of a perfectly timed drop kick leads me to believe that thing could become the next chosen one. 3:45
2:05 missed opportunity to go 'you DICK" after he hit you
That joke where the droid walks backwards is so funny. A lesser yotuber would have noticed this detail, showed their reaction and lazy joke in the moment, and moved on without a second thought. But slimy new that he could get more out of it, so he went back and gave us 4 jokes out of this moment. Love this guy. So smart.
First time I played Jedi grand master my game broke and every enemy one shit me
Cool
id genuinely love to watch a stream of charlie playing this the full way through
Thought you said “you know why they call me cow”
RIICCCCKKKK
4:57 - 5:02 is peak slimecicle
Elden Ring-Rick, soldier of god Now Rick, the door technician.
3:50 super smash bros bowser ahh dropkick
The most fearsome boss ever Even more powerful than Darth Vader himself Rick the door technician
Please come back
6:01 I can’t believe I laughed so hard at this😂😂
Rick the first elden lord
"Hey whats your name? I'm Calcium!"
7:28  Every antagonist with good intentions but bad morals.
1:48 I WENT INSANE IN VR REFRENCE RAHHH I LOVE CHARLES SLIMESICLE
Star Wars a new rope that had me wheezing
the way he did the cartman voice
20-20-20 DROPKICK
Glad I'm not the only person that makes Cal skip
2:47 "best wig not x wing."😂
Nah I'd rick
2:29 force frolicking 😂😂😂😂😂
11:36 “Wait… say that again…”
calling the chicken richard is probably one of the funniest things hes done
I tried the same thing with the not chocobos. Was disappointed when he phased through the floor. Didn’t think to ride him while we were flying away.
So there's a KFC side of the Force.
4:16 "At least this isn't a chicken...... *BWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!!"*
CURSE YOU, RICK YOU FOUL TECHNICIAN I HEREBY VOW YOU WILL RUE THIS DAY BEHOLD, A TRUE JEDI WARRIOR AND I, CHARLIE YOUR FEARS, MADE FLESH
10:08 don’t think I didn’t notice you lower the difficulty to Jedi master
Your videos are too funny
12:04 riccccckkkkkkk
3:50  the moment he realizes that the beast is actually intelligent
3:46 moments before disaster
Tanalorr is Slime
Bro PLEASEEEEE do a Spider Man 2 vid 😂😂😂😂
That last "RIIIIIIIICK!" was from the heart  2:32 must be a canon event
I love the random bits of the actual story of the game just randomly spliced into this chaotic as fuck gameplay 😂😂 Like you just backflip off a clip then boom the big twist of the game! 💀
Cal “Calzone” “Calcium” Kestis
Riiiiiiiiiiiiiiick
9:46 bro Ali shuffled him
STAR WARS NEW ROPE 1:18
Now I know how to kill oggdo easily
ick came back and he came for blood.
That is not a horse, that is a CHOCOBO
It's funny how your footage goes back and forth from Grandmaster to a lower difficulty throughout the entire video 😂
I was laughing so much definitely going to subscribe 😂❤
9:39 Why is a skriton?
9:34 "Oh a shortcut.."
SPIDER
WHAT THE FLIP
The legend of Calcium
5:36 the way he took these droids out was so cinematic.
Whats the song at  9:41?
“And it’s frog vs man, a battle as old as time. I faced last week when my car got toad.” Amazing line 😂
This is 100% the experience I’ve been having while playing this game😂
if you look at his game play, he is playing on jedi master and not grand master.
Imagine being so salty about your death you glitched across game saves to get revenge, I’m looking at you Rick
My names not 12:02
What is this game's name???
when the sequel is just as good as the original
the moment i saw oggdo bogdo I fucking screamed
I like the among us reference in the intro.
bro chickens are op. Chicken nuggets are a rare delicacy cause only a select few can square up with the Space Chickens
NATURE WAS BEAUTIFUL UNTIL IT WAS COMING AT ME FROM THE TOP ROOOPE!!!!
I guess Rick now controls both doors and windows.
I love Charles’ ability to make everything funny, and that so many of his enemies disappear right after he saves them.
Wait,,, why was God Shattering Star the background music at 5:05?
4:05 You underestimate the power of the alien chicken!!
Why is the chicken harder to kill than the AT-ST 2:17
Dude glitching out of the mantis was hilarious.
1:17   The fact it played TOTK music 😂😂😂😂😂😂
The fire emblem three houses music was a nice touch
the. fact that i also got a star wars ad
Calcium kestis
I bet that if anakin brought space chickens to the jedi temple during order 66 instead of the 501 legion. It would end in a minute.
The idea that this mythical beast that has probably never seen civilization in its like somehow knowing how to do a drop kick and pulling up with it is so goddamn funny to me
The hardest boss took me 476 times to kill Rick the Door Technician  R.I.P Rick the Door Technician
Rick became lord of doors wtf 😂
I died at 6:36 😂😂
The beast who did the dropkick reminded me of godzilla
What does RB do does it promote him
CHARLIE HEY can I recommend a game? Outerwilds is very fun game that u can get from Steam
I frickin dieing while watching this 🤣 I'm going to get caught on my phone any moment now
Remember that time when lightsabers could cut people's limbs off or slice people in half with no effort whatsoever.
Are you the end? How did that happen?
The music in the intro is a masterpiece
The game is so buggy at times and i love it
Me when I am a grandpa to my grandkids:have you ever heard the tragedy of Rick the door technician?
RICK IS CALS FATHER CONFIRMED
Why did I hear the Ori theme in here
I forgot to watch this one, I enjoyed this game a lot I’m glad a vid got made
From worst to the dumbest Jedi, truly an improvement
3:05 what's the music?
I’m officially interested in slime doing Hogwarts legacy in the hardest game mode On the switch. Suffer
upload
It was you.
5:32 this caught me so off guard
I cant play this game in like 5 years since im fucking broke and i need to move out and get a job because we aint ever getting ps5 or a gaming pc
8:33  Loses virginity  Jumps off a cliff Refuses to elaborate
Anyone got the song at 7:10 ? For science
i love that he acted like the thing he did with the chickens at the end of holotactics was a strategy even though he didn't have to act. He actually put them in a phalanx maneuver which was often used by spartans
Did you know the dots in the bottom left show ones difficulty?
The Ori Theme Was extremely unexpected and made me think my phone went off
7:29 *ultimate lifeform, R I C K god of death, master of doors*
7:34 I played a game where you make up a character to say oh yeah this pizza was ordered by Jack from maintenance or whatever you randomly pick it to be and he turns out to be real. You walk in and it’s just this massive 8 ft tall demon who ends up be a recurring character
⠀
GET OVER HERE! 0:51
WHAT NATURAL CREATURE COMES AT YOU WITH A DROP KICK!?
Slime tried to give the driver of that AT a new life, but apparantly Merrin wasnt having it.
RIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIICK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Nature is beautiful...until IT COMES IN WITH THE STEEL CHAIR!!!
Best star wars video ever
7:25 after the dude fell off the ledge I heard the law and order intro
the amongsaber
Whats the music at 1:57?  Edit: Nvm, Found it, it's All Hail Shadow (Orchestral) from Sonic 06
That titile opening screen has me messed up in the laughs
Look at the amount of views :troll:
Rick The Lord of Doors will strike back against you one day...
His car got toad 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
Spider man 2 video when???
5:23 got me
Ricks life story:  Is born, becomes a trooper, a Jedi comes to fight him, gets defeated by slimesicle,trains for 40 years, and comes back to get his revenge
The Intro is a Masterpiece
CHICKEN POWER BABBYYYYYY
Charlie has more sanity left over im so fucking pissed from the random jerks in my class
Still can't belived this the same man did the corn
I was here at 6̸̦͓̖̫̤̊̈͊̒͒͛̃͗̌͘0̶̧͓̳̮͎̻̥̙͓̈͐͗̓͗̚͜0̷̛̞̞̍͗͊̾̑̔̕͝ķ̷͍͈̯̖̠̋̌̔̚ views
"NATURE WAS BEAUTIFUL BEFORE IT HIT ME FROM THE TOP ROPE" LOL THAT HAD ME DYING
3:34  "No body's getting past me, Not without a blaster hole in them! I wonder I'll get promoted for doing such a good job!
Cocks gambit
Cal is hot
Rick the door technician is the Soldier of Godrick of star wars
force quit joke was too good
❤rick❤
I would choose not to watch this video to avoid spoilers, but Charlie is so chaotic that this video has in no way clued me into the plot.
i have watched this video more times than any mentally healthy person should
2023???
Really disappointed you didn’t say “ I’m sorry Rick but when one door closes another opens”
1:48 skill issue
This dude jist fuckin killed somebody and made a joke about fortnite wtf❤❤❤😂😂😂😂
He doesn’t fear the chickens. But he has always feared oggdo.
The majority of Slimecicle's videos explained in 2 words; Chaos, Hillarious. 😂😈
4:00 “My Names calcium!”                                 Famous last words - 2011/2023
this guy is so funny! he should do a collab with slmccl
Even this generation’s entertainment is  tots piece of sit..........
Hears dark souls music, turns around, see bird approaching covered in red,  heath bar of birde apears
"its called jedi skipping, the other padawans bullied me for it but they're all dead"
You really felt all the emotions at 8:00
3:41 killed me that “NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!” Was something personal
“Why would they call it Jedi Survivor…When you can’t” this sent me 😭
1:17 TOTK???
Slmccl is great because they're always well edited videos with Charlie being stupidly funny as always and it's just him having fun in whatever playthrough he can. Slimecicle is pure greatness because usually the Slmccl-type videos are what get uploaded on the main channel for most people, but Slimecicle takes it a step further by scripting that playthrough and making it genuinely the best edited experience imaginable. Slmccl videos are Charlie himself. Slimecicle videos are Charlie's vision.
I love the fact the chicken is OP in both base game and the board game within the game…
I saw another video where they bugged the ship like that, I dont know if it was the other famous charlie on the internet or what but it was great to see slime do the same thing 😂 ik it was a bug he’d find one way or another and of course he did
Why the fuck did "Cal-cium Kestis" get me so bad! Laughed so hard for such a stupid joke.
Day 1 of asking Charlie to upload tears of the kingdom
AAAAAAA a spider 🕷️
Dual of Fates was a perfect choice for the double ogdo fight
DAMN YOU RICKKKKKKKKKK       maybe we will get a rematch 🤔
What game is this?
6:00 I see, you had the same Idea as me, I later stepped it up by even pulling the guys that were still in the fort into the whole, after they were done, it was a cakewalk.
Corn
Finally a part 2 to thsi
The chicken… WHAT-
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA a           spider
The kazoo jumpscared me so bad omg
The rebels should have used the damn chickens.
Hm.. wait a damn minute "Rick, Lord Of Doors" BRO IS AN ELDEN RING BOSS
The spider bit him and now he's in the spiderman game
Somebody ring the Dinkster?
he entered THE COOP
10:49 is this what bins look like 1000 years in the future?!?!?!?!?
Your videos are fucked when your high as hell
Play people playground
4:07 bro hafter a popies ad came up
Btw i think the backrooms had an update so there are more levels
Wait what would happen if Rick vs the chicken who would win
4:18  vore
Ah yes calcium kesticle

Jorts
A master jedi
C O C K T R O O P E R
WHERE TF DID RICK COME FROM AT THE END!?
The funny thing is when i started a new journey plus i also pissed of a scout trooper
Day 2 ask simecicle too make a new wobbledogs video
So if i bought a bunch of chickens i could take over the world? Sick!
CHICKEN ARE GOD
4:07
Someones got this mans tied by the balls. This isnt a slimecicle video it feels like his editing software overdoesed on crack and pixie sticks
Strong with the force is the chicken
My primary strategy for Holotactics is unironically just spamming murder chickens lol
"RICK LORD OF DOORS"
7:03 😨😨
Sick intro bro
This is the funniest man on the planet. There's not a single god damn second im not smiling or laughing
3:44 anguish
Dude, play mass effect.

Totk song❤ ( i know im a month late)
gotta love how chickens in this game and Zelda are menace to society.
Dude I literally beat the oggdo fight by pulling those guys down to😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
'I fear no man, but that c**k, it scares me'
corn
silly string lightsaber thumbnail
"why would they call it jedi survivor... if you can't?"
Completely unrelated but I think that inscryption would make a good video idea
The beginning woke up my ducking parents
I am a certified gooper
The fact that this dude just says stuff at perfect moments just makes me love him even more
the return of the jedi
I need a paper clip to forget this
You should try playing tears of the kingdom. You can do LITTERALLY ANYTHING. Also you can make a cum joke early on
1:58 It was at this moment he realised, it was not a space chicken, not a space cock....    but a space *turkey*
7:15 are we in the b- b- b- backrooms?    And this video taught me that star wars chickens are stronger then rey
Fun fact: cadê forever mapa???
You should play Super Slime Simulator. 10/10 gameplay
Charlie, that horse... is actually an ostrich...
They should have a difficulty level where every enemy is a chicken
it’s nice that slime choose not to hit us with an easy rickroll
DAM YOU RIIIIICK
the inexplicable need for devs to make the in-world chickens just way too overpowered is so fucking funny, first the cucoos in Legend of Zelda and now these weird little bastards? as someone who has a couple chickens, those funky little guys are phenomenal
Did that ape judgment kick him
Slimecicle, i know this isnt the place for suggestuons, but.  Do scape and run parasites, its a minecraft mod.
I just found out he isn't on jedi grandmaster the whole time because there would be two orange dots in the bottom left corner the whole time
7:15   b a c k r o o m s
7:13 bro got kicked so good he got sent into the backroom 10:00 bro 😂😂
I NEED MORE WALKING DEAD VR IF YOU DONT I WILL KILL THE SLIMECICLE PLUSHIE THIS IS NOT AND I MEAN NOT A DRILL
slimecicle return of the content
You’re the monster you don’t get run come back here and scare me
Video idea: go to goatman bridge
kooky krazy carbine.
Rick cannot be killed
I’d you can change Cal’s hair on the spot, does that mean he’s bald :l
Pee
CHARLIE.  I need a Gegg plushie. PLEASE  tell quackity if you have to just..uhh Gegg🙂
I think that's the sound effect if you try to dropkick a frickin robot
I was expecting another wii tennis joke... i was disappointed
The spider is watching you. Always.
Rick is the best door technician. Ready to kill if it is to fix a door.
DAMM YOU RICKKKKKKK my favorite part
The beast of the bonk did a side B using bowser
How is it like being the main villain for the Batman 2022?
the kingdom hearts music 🔥
It's a main channel video so you know it's fire
The fact you didn't insta die by the chicken power attack has to be a bug or you are playing on padawan difficulty xD though i think it insta kills in padawan aswell
Please play kaiju paradise please it fits your theme of slime slimecicle
I’m burgers
It’s genuinely so nice to see Charlie return to his older format. Don’t get me wrong, his more ambitious projects are great, and slmccl is awesome, but this is what our world needs.
0:30 wet 👍
I'll play overwatch with you Charlie
I love how notoriously impossible the space chickens are
first time i heard "know why they call me cow cestis?" 😂
All I have to say.. Charlie's death rattle in 3:43. Beautiful.
we need more of rick the door god
My name is Rick and you killed me
1:20 is so funny
can we talk about how the storm trooper went to go to college and got a degree in psychology, and all it took was charlie saving his life
It's a reflex to say backrooms now
Charlie when will we get corn 3 it's been a year since the last corn 2
"It's kill or be killed" Charlie: it's be killed over and over again until you kill
smash
I’m recommend playing phasmophobia with the creator insym he’s one of the best players and is very funny and can help with gameplay
The unsung rivalry of Calcium Cestus and Rick the door technician has begun.
Legend has it that that singular Stormtrooper did indeed change his life. He changed it so drastically that he unmade himself in an instant.
slimecicle where's the corn?
How did you manage to make your character look exactly like me
hey slime deity is there ever going to be a part 2 of the modded skyrim vr?
*kills rick* "Yeah im the good guy"😀😀😂😂😂
I didn't know I need a rick saga,but now I do
Damm slime screaming like the punisher mean is top notch 🔥
Charlie Slimecicle sure is one of the people of all time
The game glitches have made his sense of humor infinitely more funny.
We need a Rick The Door Tech tv show
NATURE WAS BEAUTIFUL UNTIL IT WAS COMING AT ME FROM THE TOP ROOOOPE!!!
I liked the punisher references
"Jumpin'  Jawas that's a chest!" is the most Charlie thing to say
5:56 I can’t believe someone did this too lmao
<3 <3
guys, dont blame slime for the lack of content, fsr all AAA games lately have been hot shit.
Didn't realize space chicken were this powerful
Can't wait for the rey movie where it just ends with rick kicking her ass
The chulk
Why is his scream so violent😭 3:42
OHHHH YOUUU RICK!!
2:01 you're baby?
Can't tell you how happy i am to hear those beautiful kazoo notes
“What does RB do does that promote him?” *commits put hole in chest* *”NOOOOOOOOOOO”*
The cock trooper 😂😂😂😂😂
I got a taco bell ad right after the ding at 6:23
Ogdo Bogdoed
Dude literally makes star wars funnier by being himself
Dude please do more vr
Rick teams up with chickens
Not the chickens
i wish we could befriend rick the doorman smh
RICK CAME BACK FOR VEGANCE
Leave it to Charle to find every glitch possible in a video game
Hey man this shithead named @slmccl has been literally using a copy of your face to get more subs, I think you should take him down
4:13 He said "chickens" and I instantly got a KFC ad
The Chulk playing syarwars :O
Alternate title: the most fucking autistic Jedi in the God damn galaxy
The Ori and the Blind Forest music at 3:46 was a fucking gut punch TOT
i coudent strop laghing at the end
3:51  Charlie you gotta learn not to trust everything that has kind eyes
please the fucking final fantasy fight music had me rolling 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Love how he got fucking PTSD from Oggdo Bogdo
uhm hacktually its GrEeN MiLk!
Posting on his main channel??? Insanity.
Am so glad someone talked about the chicken crisis. They one shot on hardest difficulty
4:13 after you said chicken YT gave me a KFC AD  Edit: yay someone else removed the scammer comment
Another masterpiece from slimcicle
Truly one of the games of all time.
I have been waiting ages for this 🤣
Bro these jokes are top tier I’m always excited for these videos
Who's been feeding those chickens, cuz they just fold every living thing like clothes 😂
I swear Slime is like... The Youtuber version of Jim Carrey. I swear XD
Professional charlie voice acted masterpiece
Play hogwarts legacy. I feel like that would make a funny vid
it was rick the lord of the doors his vengance no's no bounds
6:53 i respect the PvZ, but that wallpaper is absolutely foul
Great video, loved the missing spider that we could all clearly see crawl in the background.
i die from cancer every time you upload and its funny
After all this time, it’s finally here and better than ever❤ thank you for this video Mr.Slime, I always find myself going back to the first time you played this on your channel and it always manages to make me laugh. This sequel is no exception, great work as always Charlie, thanks for these silly little videos😂
I just realized that the thumbnail had among us in it.
The amount of times he switches the difficulty between story mode, master and grand master 💀
Cna you play dead space two plz
Man I missed that kazoo
Charles Slimington. You comedic genius. You need to play Ultrakill, you won’t regret it.
Rick Lord Of Doors is the strongest character in Star Wars apparently
Go back to this kind of editing!
I’ve been waiting for him to go back to his original video format I missed this shit!!!!
He's crossed the threshold into another game.  The Soldier of God, Rick.
1:58 It's the fuckin turkey from far cry 5 they evolved and now they hunt you down in this game holy shmockeries
Rick was too powerful
my god... i never thought it was possible... a technician with the dark side of the force. DAMN U RICK!
What are you some kinda Jedi Survivor?
You should play 7 days to die
Yo like this gave me multiple chuckles dude freaking EARNED  a sub lol
Those troopers were PACKING, and I don't mean the heavy gunner...
That’s not a horse, that’s an ostrich
That last "RIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIICK" really got me. The emotion Cal shows as he gets struck down by his archenemy, the Lord of Doors himself, is unexplainable. Truly one of the most captivating moments in all of Star Wars.
Yo slime you should try tears of the kingdom
back,rooms
Wow, “Charlie” this sure was a good “video”!
Spawn of Oggdo: *Appears* Slimecicle: *Past Trauma Intensefies*
I love the drop kick
I'm currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can’t believe how magical it was 1:12. That part truly made me shed a tear. And especially at 6:34 that part was just so truly heart touching words can not describe the series of emotions I felt. I absolutely loved the climax it had insanely excellent detail. Oh and we can’t forget the conclusion. The conclusion was the greatest and saddest conclusion I have ever seen better than any of the books I have read. Thank you so much for creating this absolute masterpiece. This is essentially the most important masterpiece of film history. It is a tragedy that this, it can’t be called a film, but a transcendent emotional experience, will be inaccessible for most. It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating. This might be the most impactful piece of art I’ve come across in my life, and I’m definitely coming back to it in the near future to study it more deeply. this is an absolute masterpiece , I was brought to tears listening to this and seeing the bacon go whirly swirly in a circle countless times. it absolutely moved my soul , and I don't think I can ever be the same. this bacon has changed my entire mental state , I am now at peace with who I am and what I will be doing later in my life. i have forgiven all my enemies and now I am a man of a pacifist life. I will move on , gotta move on , as the song says. the bacon is so inspirational , it shares it vast wisdom with all of us , and we are all so lucky that it would bestow it's great words with us. we are all children on bacon. hail bacon. hail bacon. The spinning bacon, rotating in one direction with this music... This made me tear up. How could such a bacon do such a thing? I'm struck by awe by this masterpiece. Especially when the bacon spins, showing its lightly salt covered tan skin. I can hear the crunch just from here, and so as the beautiful sound of the bacon scraping the dark, smooth velvet floor. The flavor, music and everything can be heard, tasted, seen and felt from a screen. You can really hear the breaths between the music artist, empathizing her love for this rotating bacon. Truly what I call modern art. This was the most legendary performance by any piece of bacon I have ever watched. The acting was top tier and very life changing. This is one of the greatest work from a piece of bacon I have ever seen especially on 57:42.I am currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can’t believe how magical it was at 1:12. That part truly made me shed a tear.

This is one of the greatest work from a bacon I have ever seen especially on 17:24. I am currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can’t believe how magical it was 1:12. That part truly made me shed a tear. And especially at 6:34 that part was just so truly heart touching words can not describe the series of emotions I felt. I absolutely loved the climax it had insanely excellent detail. Oh and we can’t forget the conclusion. The conclusion was the greatest and saddest conclusion I have ever seen better than any of the books I have read. Thank you so much for creating this absolute masterpiece. This is essentially the most important masterpiece of film history. It is a tragedy that this, it can’t be called a film, but a transcendent emotional experience, will be inaccessible for most. It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. The work put in to this is incredibly inspiring. The graphics, the animation, the music, so much thought was put into it. This has remined me that you can do anything you put your mind to. Not even mentioning the memories, this makes me feel like an infant again, just laying my eyes on this beautiful masterpiece gives me all the good feelings in life. I also understand what happiness is again from this. Not even to mention the most incredible part that is 2:10. Bacon spinning has changed my life for the better. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating. This might be the most impactful piece of art I’ve come across in my life, and I’m definitely coming back to it in the near future to study it more deeply. this is an absolute masterpiece , I was brought to tears listening to this and seeing the bacon go whirly swirly in a circle countless times. it absolutely moved my soul , and I don't think I can ever be the same. this bacon has changed my entire mental state , I am now at peace with who I am and what I will be doing later in my life. So much great graphic design, so much suspense, so much greatness in this one video. i have forgiven all my enemies and now I am a man of a pacifist life. I will move on , gotta move on , as the song says. the bacon is so inspirational , it shares it vast wisdom with all of us , and we are all so lucky that it would bestow it's great words with us. we are all children on bacon. hail bacon. hail bacon. The spinning bacon, rotating in one direction with this music... This made me tear up. How could such a bacon do such a thing? I'm struck by awe by this masterpiece. Especially when the bacon spins, showing its lightly salt covered tan skin. I can hear the crunch just from here, and so as the beautiful sound of the bacon scraping the dark, smooth velvet floor. The flavor, music and everything can be heard, tasted, seen and felt from a screen. You can really hear the breaths between the music artist, empathizing her love for this rotating bacon. Truly what I call modern art. This was the most legendary performance by any bacon I have ever watched. The acting was top tier and very life changing. This is one of the greatest work from a piece of bacon I have ever seen especially on 57:42. I am crying. This has made me go through an emotional rollercoaster. I cried, beat off, and also watched a movie while watching this premiere. This has made me go through so much. I passed depression because of this. It really inspired me to become an outstanding young man. Thank you. 😭
6:53 nice backround bro
turns out Rick the Door Technician was the final boss
Calcium Cestus is canon now
Don’t forget tf2
OMG I MISSED THE KAZOO SO MUCH

Star Wars’s main villain. . . Earth Vader. Slimecicle’s main villain. . . Rick.
Damn you Rick, damn you to hell
okay
this was amazing overall but 10:51 had me absolutely on the floor
THE PRODIGAL SON RETURNS!!
3:43 that was such a. beautiful scream of emotional distress. 10/10. great form.
“My name is Calcium Kestis and I drink blue milk” - Charlie Slimecicle 2023, one of the many great quotes from this video  Also side note but I love how modern yet authentic this video is to the Slimecicle videos from a few years back. The style is so much like the older ones but the jokes, sound effects, improved editing and everything are straight from today, love it
aaa a spider
Is there anything of him playing the full game? Like did he stream this
finally back after THREE YEARS
Bro turned down difficulty
The title didn't lie, great work!
GUYS its the new movie
God this game is great. Slimecicle is great too. Everything is great
Damn these are some op chickens
His humor has never changed and that's a good thing
No one will convince me this game was meant to be played any other way I laughed the entire time
Yeahhhh boy it's the SLIME SAGA
If I learned anything from this video it's that chickens are op af.
That ending mann 😂😂 OMG I can't breathe from laughing. Love your videos a lot. ❤❤
funny, very funny
1:19 bro became flashgitz for a second 💀💀
3:45 gave me flashbacks to when id spend hours playing the ori games, they were fun and had some of the best music but they had some really sad finishes to their stories
The one fucking word of all star got me so bad😂
Star was
song at 1:20? please and thank you?
Man screw Star wars Jedi survivor this is Star wars rise of the coop
The overwatch joke killed me
1:11 play valorant :-:
I don't think I've ever laughed so hard at "Did the beast of the bog just pull up with a f&%$ing drop kick?"
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS VIDEO TO RELWASE
6:42  oh no
8:56 SOMEONE SEND THIS TO THE SPEEDRUNNING COMMUNITY IMMEDIATELY!
Did you find it
Might possibly be the only one who died to Rick the Door Technician
rick really messed you up at the end 🤣🤣🤣
6:53 PVZ IN A SLIMECICLE VIDEO WE WIIIIN
4:22 and 4:28 puny storm trooper and puny jedi
Today was the most awful day of my week and this video just made it such a good day lol
star wars survivor: dark souls
Rick came back from Hell to settle the beef XD
NOOOOOOO THE SPIDER!!!
It's always a nice year when Charlie uploads
I am so happy I am in love with the original video so this is a pleasant surprise
This feels like one of Charlies older videos and it feels nostalgic, keep up the great sense of humor chief!
The second that slime finished saying "I'm not even tempted by the darkside anymore to be honest. I just want to buy a bunch of chickens" I got an ad for KFC
Ah yes, Calcium cestis
I found this channel when he played the first game
Rick the door technician is the most powerful being in the universe
I mean, if you faced a chicken the size of a large bulldog, you'd be scared too.
You thought rick the door technician was bad have a look at rick the lord of doors
🍞
how are the chickens the most strongest thing in the whole game?
truly incredible
I guess that turkey joke he made way back in his horizon video payed off
Oh if Afro Senju saw how you took care of Spawn of Ogdo he would not be very happy, if you know you know
“Let’s play Star Wars!”       *Inserts FF7 music*
WHAT ARE THE POWER OF THOSE CHICKENS?!
10/10
3:50 JUDGEMENT
something something password something something remembered something something see you all next year
50 Cal 💪💪💪
NO way slimecicle went back in time
Those fuckin' space cocks being so OP is hilarious
Cal is short for the legendary Calzone
Dude looks went from a ginger shlatt to a ginger Keanu
I was a freshman when Charlie uploaded the first video now I graduated hischool. That's crazy
This is your reminder that Jesus took the punishment that we all deserve so that we could be forgiven and he loves you so much that no matter how far you are away from God he will welcome you with love and open arms if you just believe,trust, repent and love Jesus and remember what he did for us😊
HE"S BACK ON THE MAIN CHANNEL
Amazing and hilarious video 👌🏽
Rick soldier of god
holy shit, so happy to see the old content style :D. You made my day better
The long awaited sequel to the other video is here
When we needed him most, he returned
Patrick “MY NAME IS NOT” 12:02
5:30
Dude you are so funny
This is the greatest sequel I could’ve asked for
we should make charlie slimecicle play angry birds star wars
maybe he didnt forget his password after all
This game was a long time coming  As was this video
Absolutely amazed and so happy we got a Slimecicle upload so soon!!!!
Rick? More like Rick! GOTTEM!
hell yeah baby i missed those silly and funny as always thanks charlie
It’s been YEARS
This feels good, feels like old slimecicle
I am so glad slime is as funny as he was back in fallen order
The other Padawans bullied me but their all fuckin dead is hottest roast since alderan
Let’s gooooooooooooooo
3:40  What a scream....
Rick was the true villian of the game
LETS GO A SLIMECICLE VIDEO
I like that the tears of the kingdom theme song played on the bridge with the ripe
Ditto
Charlie: *Kiss a woman once*  *Commits suicide*  Why is that the most Gillion Tidestrider thing?
Soldier of god, Rick vs Rick the door technician
two slimecicle videos inside of a single year???  improbable
I'm already laughing at the idea of Charlie playing the cursed halo again mod for mcc. Oh my God I wanna see that
Finally my 12 minutes of happiness
I have a sore throat, and it hurts to laugh, but boy is this so funny I cna't stop. Also, I need your help finding a new esophagus.
I needed this so bad as a Star Wars fan bro 😭
5:32 SOME BO-
STAR WARS, A NEW ROPE
Chicken
"Jumpin Jawas" and "UP THE SENSITIVITY" made me laugh a little too hard
Who knew Adam Sandler had a YouTube channel
“This is so easy a baby could survive!” *Historically, this has proven incorrect.*
Calcium Kestis has got to be made canon now, like if that isn't the funniest shit then I don't know what is.
I've missed this
The sequel of all time
What is the music? I keep thinking it’s an orchestral remix of the Pizza Tower intro music.
when will he play bonelab
i can feel this video destroying my attention span i love it
5:32 body once told me the world was macaroni
Ba bling
AT 3:55 IS THAT MUSIC FROM ORI AND THE BLIND FOREST???
The overwatch joke had me dying😂
Realistic chicken game
From “the worst jedi in all of star wars” to the “funniest jedi of all star wars”
My most anticipated sequel of 2023
When you're so used to seeing slmccl update, and the SUDDENLY, slimecicle.
Thank you Slimcycle
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA      a     spider
Gay
Yooooooo a classic style slimecicle upload we need more of this
This isn’t the sequel we deserve, it’s the sequel we NEED
HE POSTED ON HIS MAIN
words cannot describe how happy i was to hear those fucking kazoos
Rick shall never be defeated.
OH MY GOODNESS, I was waiting for this let’s gooooo!!
The editing was just wow
the cocktrooper
Banger video, can't wait to see more, I want to see maximum JDM upgrades I wanna see that baby Tokyo drift
this is by far the best reaction to rick i've seen.
Legend has it his father is still looking for the calcium.
The sequel: starring Rick the door technician and calcium
I’ve waited for this sequel for far too long The search is finally over
THIS IS THE SEQUEL I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR
I haven't heard a slimecicle kazoo in so long, it really hit me with some nostalgia
6:15 right when the taco bell sound happened I got  text from my mom... the sound lined up perfectly and nothing else in my life will ever be that perfect...
The return to form from Slimecicle that we've all been waiting for. It's as if 2020 never came
Blue milk😂
Goddamn! The first half of this video had me in tears, diaphram collapsed with laughter. How was I not subscribed already!?
5:33 best part Guy: this isn't so bad a child could survive this *Floor opens up beneath him lands in pit* THE FIRST SPAWN OGGDO HUNGERS Guy: f*** help me frog he is of your kin Frog:*in deep voice*  finish him brother
🤣"My name Calcium Kestus. And I love drinking Blue Milk!"🤣
This just feels like an old Charlie slimecicle intro
YEAYYAYAYAYAYAYA SLIMICICICILE VIDEOOOOOO
5:31 Fuck you I spat my coffee all over my keyboard XDD
Many people cannot stand to the might of Rick the Door Technician, but only one Jedi is prophesied to defeat him, Gilderoy Gooberguy, the funniest of all jedis.
my favoutite tghing of this video...imy pc shoved it to 480p and i was  just like.. damn how long charlie gonna have it crispy for a bit.
Putting out like 2 videos a year, I guess he made a ton of money from those sponsors.
I still can’t play this game with medium graphics and a decent frame rate :p
Congrats on trending The Boy Boiler
The sequel we needed
Man would have these games if they had character creation this guy is realy boring
Ah sh*t here we go again
Damn i didnt realize just how much i had missed your content until i couldnt stop crying laughing at this vid
I can’t believe he got a hammer soldier to fight oggdo for him on grand master difficulty and it worked. 😂 5:56
The developers should pay this man. He made me want to play this game again 😂
Survivor? I barely know her!
A true return to form. Keep it up, Slime!
Star Wars revenge of the rope
Star Wars the last rope
Thank you for giving me the will to live
That is an underrated calcium joke
Stawwaws
how did you some how get funnier?
I clicked on this video thinking it was the fallen order video
good job calling the cock richard, I'm proud of you
Calculator Kestis: How was my pizza joke? Some emo girl : *Outstanding*
thanks for ove r simutsatin
Fucking aboot time
Hell yeah good video among us
Survivor? I barely know 'er
So funny! 😂
THE SEQUEL.  2:23 also I did these EXACT same things in my game before you released this video lol. The skipping and dramatically saving that trooper only for him to disappear.
Slimecicle ability: common sense and comedy
“All the other padawans bullied me for it but a they’re fucking dead so” Pure gold
I’m not even 5 minutes in and I’m laughing so hard my ribs hurt
6:38 is pure PTSD.
The sequal to the first video of yours I watched that introduced me to your channel, I’ve been waiting for this for too long!
Dang, some idiot named Slmccl recommended this guy, and he’s kinda funny
Return of the king
I'm going to be laughing at "Nature was beautiful until it was coming at me from the top rope" all day
If the game is cannon, then that means that the ship leaving without Cal is also cannon🤯
The intro got me spinning :P
It took me so long to realize that was a among us guy as the saber
“But why would they call it grand master Jedi survivor, if you can’t….” I feel that.. 😭
1:30 I see you’ve been inspired by Tears of the Kingdom 😂
Omg hé uploaded
Been waiting for the return of CALCIUM KASTAS SOOOOO MUCH!!!!!
I appreciate the use of Darkest Dungeon ost
Been replaying fallen order and actually forgot how broken it could be too lol
The only reason i played original  was that PSN gave it out for free. And even then I feel like I made a bad purchase. Could have been a great game.  Instead they "forced" Soul-like bullshit without providing the thing that makes Souls like bullshit fun - Gear, gear upgrades, skills and power progression. And then you get an inept Jedi slapping a rando stormtrooper 20 times in the head with weak ass Light-Bat untill they FAINT from bludgeoning.  It was supposed to be a CUTTING BLADE. A Blade that CUTS 90% of MATERIALS.  NOPE ! RANDO TROPPER PARRIES U?? Why does everyone RESET AFTER Jedi Meditates? They just bring new squadrons off screen? Why is enemy placement in such a way to backstab? Why is every GOD DAMN CHEST shitty ass cosmetics?  They learned NOTHING from the first game. NOTHING
Been waitin a long time for this
I love this goofy guy
I see among us I click
HEEEEEESSSSSSS BAAAAACKKKKKKK
cool
Rick is just built different
So in star wars to beat the sith they should of dropped chickens instead of bombs got it
7:37 about the same level as James the electrician
Hi  Play ULTRAKILL  Bye
Oh fuck yea
HE’S BACK!!!!
the baby joke from Genloss😭
He never even gave us a full series of the first game
AMOGUS???
rick be nutty wit it
This video is complete perfection in every way
Sooo goooood , I needed this thank you
What music is it at 1:20?
M.
No way it didnt took slimecicle 1 year to upload a video
Wow wat a great slime I mean slime I mean slime I mean slime
“Lucky for me the only thing this puppy can’t run is away!” -Slmccl 2023
Oh god, he's back!
Whenever i go up against a guy that kills me i always shout *HE’S SUPER SAIYAN* makes me feel better about myself when i kill um
1:18 how did this happen to him again
Calcium Kestis 😂
The intro tells me this is a good video!
slimecicle. you are the high ground
the sequel we were all waiting for and its awesome
I died when Rick returned for vengeance in the new game+
6:41 oggdooooooo boggdooooooooo!
A video once per quarter? Let's see if the strategy pays off, Jim.
Oggdo Boggdo was so fucking annoying on bogano in the first game dude
Notice how he went from 'Rick The Door Technition' to 'Rick Lord Of Doors'
I can't wait for all the goo puns he'll say while playing Spider-Man 2
CALCIUM KESTIS!!!
Fuck yeah
this was honestly hilarious to watch, especially those stupid space cocks
I got a Star war ad when I clicked into this video
This was awesome
1:35 i need to try this like right now brb lol
Will you make a vid about a batman arkham game?
are you going to upload the lets play for this ?
amog saber am i right guys hhahhhahahhahahahahahhahaahhahahahahahahahahaahahah
it says something about schlmmcl's echalon of humor that he doesnt feel the need to use "jedied" and scrape the bottom of the barrel
All of this effort and it's still gonna be less popular than the backrooms noise videos, which is a fucking shame because this is so much better than any of those videos
At least he isn’t the worst Jedi in Star Wars right? Right? 😂.                      I was expecting Charles to sing stoooriiyyy at the end 😢
i missed that fucking kazoo
The crew cut joke is even better now that respawn released a infographic that showed is was the most used hairstyles, so it is quite literally "the best wig"
I wasn’t sold at first, but I’m definitely buying this game now
1:05 finally someone mentions it omg lol that was my initial reaction lmaooo
0:50 you know this is already amazing from that one Charlie "come hereeeee" lmaoooo
I want Rick to be a Jedi fr
Rick is too powerful
Rick, the Lord of Doors truly was the most main villain of the story.
It’s criminal that after 11 hours less than 200k people have seen this.
Wait when did you get your vowels back?
Yes
Strongest mobs in the game (Top 5): 1. Rick Lord of the Doors 2. Rick the Door Technician 3. Chickens 4. Darth Vader 5. Ogdo Bogdo
Hey slimecicle I absolutely love your videos and I hope you get to 4 mil subscribers soon
I really hope Rick the Door Technician is an ongoing character in either slimecicle lore or these games
Lesss GOOOOOO!!!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Thank you for uploading this otherworldly video, Grand Master Slime. I hope one day you will reach the desired level of ground.
My cat got spooked by the noises in the intro and fucking booked it
I think I actually forgot that the main channel existed.
THE SEQUEL!!!!!!
I believe Charlie was always insane but his yt career proved it
HE REMEMBERD HIS PASSWORD !!!!WOOOOO!!
I love these videos😂 top tier humor
perfectly short so schlatt will watch.
whaaat a new video on slimecicle
before clicking on the video, seeing the preview of the star wars intro, i said to myself “i bet $100 that the intro song will be a kazoo remix”
The sequel to my introduction to slime
this is my favourite kind of slimecicle video
Charlie’s original fallen order video made me play that and it became one of my favourite games and is the reason I bought survivor and now I love that game more
“My name is calcium kestis” had me wheezing
Finally, a good sequel
HELL YEA
I'd never thought I'd see Calcium and "jschlatt" cross paths 4:21!
We need a movie about Rick now
“Nature is beautiful when it wasn’t coming at me from the top rope” every second of a slimecicle video is very quotable
Swear those chickens are something else. Never have I every been 1 shoted so many times by such a harmless looking enemy.
Bro the start of all star made me giggle way too much 5:31
the end task bit is clearly foreshadowing a plants vs zombies game of the year edition video
I’m left with only one question, who would win: Rick, lord of doors, or Dick, lord of wheels?
Jesus Christ loves you all ❤❤❤
All life is temporary, but Rick. Rick is eternal
YES, THIS IS LIKE THE OLD VIDS, THIS SHIT SLAPS
I absolutely love that Slimecicle's main channel videos are exactly the same 4 years later
That chicken had me raging fr charlie slimecicle 1994-2027
Titanfall 2 play through?
Who knew that rick would be the best callback, he went from guarding doors to being the lord of doors, who could have possibly seen that coming?
Star Wars: Sliming
hes fucking BACK LETSSSS GOOOOOOOO
You are the best YouTuber ever
9:13 my phone died at this moment. It took me much longer than I would like to admit that it was not in fact an incredible bit but my charger had been unplugged from the wall.
6:42 It's always either the chickens or the big frogs xD
Nature 1, Calcium -666
10:17 I KNEW Slimecicle would make that joke!
He returned
I thought this was a poobtube thumbnail
WE NEEDED THIS thank you so much
Oh Rick is still out there He will find you And he will kill you   Unless you buy starwars doors hell yeah starwars doors everybody!
Four years in the making
Nice use of Sonic 06's ost at 1:58
3:45 Love the Ori music in the background. Solid choice
as soon as i clicked the video i said "hes going for the hardest difficulty"
the kazoo is such an old and gold charlie bit
Ok, but Rick the Door Technician vs The Wheel Man. Truly, a Duel Of the Fates.
Gotta love the music from Ori and also Fire emblem 3h great video
THE SEQUEL
THE SAME GLITCH IS STILL THERE? HOW?
the sequel we didnt want, the sequel we needed
11:51 RIIIIIIIIIIICCCKKK
I don't like chickens anymore
Idk bro, ur lightsaber in the thumbnail was lookin kinda sus ngl
I loved it when Slimecicle said "gronking time" and slimed all over the floor
the last thing I was expecting out of a pillar that makes a song was "someb-"
11:57 Star Wars the revenge of the Rick😂
I was hoping the thumbnail wasn't photoshopped and he had genuinely installed a mod that made his lightsaber beam into the shape of an Amogus, and I was very disappointed.
from 4 minutes on there are clips not in jedi grandmaster how dare you >:(                          (the two golden dots in the bottom left mean hes on jedi grandmaster so when they arent there its a different difficulty)
Ricks final stand
Finely done👏
Slimecicle is now scared of farms Because of the chickens, especially if the owner is rick
I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THISSSSSSS
Incredible. Powerful. Moving. Easily my new favorite episode of Shameless.
Rick came back for one final "eff you" to Slime...
I've never been so happy to hear a kazoo in my life
That scream was so raw it was hilarious " Godd*m you. RIIIIIIIIIICKKKKKKK!!!!!"
Oh hey I guess this guy's back
Roses are red Spaceships are sick Charlie got killed  By a Technician named Rick
OMG THIS IS THE EARLYEST SLIME VID I EVER SAW
Nah the ad was timed perfectly “I’m gonna go buy some chick- KFC NEE CHICKEN SANDWICH”
Rick: The Lord of The Doors Coming to Theaters soon….
HE RETURNS. YEEEEEEEEEESSSSS. btw love JRWI
LET'S GOOOOOO
Hey guys it’s me Adam Sandler I’m in your skull now
(:
Calculator kestis
SLIME PLEASE PLAY IT TAKES TWO ITS SUPER FUN
Finally, a main channel upload
Behind his helmet, we're all Rick, Rick .R oll
This was absolute gold.
A true master peace 😂❤
NEW SKLIME UPLOAD
Bro he made this game so funny
Poor Charlie had his Frank Castle moment at 5:42
Oh hey you’re still living
‘
1.  2:38 After the Finn incident they added a self-destruction mode in all the stormtroopers in case  they change sides(? 2. 7:08 Is it really that easy to get a promotion in the empire?  3. 7:15 *ptsd* 4. 8:05 stab him through the torso doesn't insta kill him… no wonder Rick went full on melee against you
HOLY SHIT HE LIVES.
"oh hey a new video from slmccl... OH MY GOD SLIMECICLE"
I’ve been waiting for this…..
1:58 The fact I know that this music track is the end cutscene of Shadow’s story from Sonic 06 blows my mind
The ear rape intro lol 😂
Why are you using windows 11
0:56 same
Legend says he hasn't walked through another door ever since, too afraid that Door lord Rick is near
PRAISE BE FOR THE KING HAS RETURNED!
Damn, JRWI must be paying off. Slime's voice acting is top notch here.
the kazoo and slide whistle make a very welcomed comeback
5:43 the punisher
i think milk-dalorian killed me 3:16
Crazy I never got any huge bugs or glitches in my play through mostly just textures not loading
A nice return to the old days of slimecicle
Was anyone else thinking Tears of the Kingdom at 1:21
Rise of the SlimPire
I can't believe Slimecicle just decided to copy Slmccl's entire personality, humor, editing style, voice, physical body and home adress, wth!
Sounded a little frank castle there 9:88
How did he cheese frog, tf?
BABE wAKE UP! NEW SLIMECICLE MAIN CHANNEL UPLOAD!
today was garenteed to be a great one when i saw this came out
This game really makes me *feel* like a Star War
how did this man skip over the fight with Batman after his appearance at the end of the last game
I just realized the right lightsaber is a among us character
When slimecicle post a video it's always a good day
Rick take a revenge😂😂😂
I love when he said "its funny goofy slime guy time" and funnily goofily slime guyed all over the place
The sheer emotion behind the final “Rick” Truly remarkable
I didn’t know how much I needed this, I’m so glad he came back to this franchise 😂
“If you strike me down, I will become more powerful than you could possibly imagine.”  -Rick, The Door Technician
The Chicken ALWAYS Wins.
8:28 post nut clarity is really hitting you hard huh?
I am late
Im thankful that Charlie escaped tommyinits basement and is now back to making funny content can't wait for the next vid charlie
Charlie please where is the spider I’m scared
Anakin vs Obi-Wan in a nutshell 9:18
Bro was so good at the game he saved everyone. Not just the men but the women and children too.
The chicken is gonna become Survivor's version of the Oggdo meme. and then they'll make the third game with a chicken boss fight.
9:13   Looks like he finally went to the dark side...
I got jumpscared by God Shattering Star at 5:05. Such a banger song
This truly is a never-ending story
Now we just need God of War 2 vid
I haven’t seen this level of Calcium vs Chicken hostility since Chick-Fil-A
I do not have ground. Please help. I am falling.
So much “tears of the kingdom” music, when’s that play through coming out?
Oh my god I need MOREEEEEEEEEE
Charlie: “RICKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK”
Incredible. Powerful. Moving. Easily my new favorite video of this YouTube
The chikens, THE CHICKENSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!11
Just saw this as I was scrolling. Truly a blessing to see
This is the best Startrek Galaxy Wars the Next Halo movie Disney has ever produced.
It's amazing how glitched this game is on PC, ain't it 'master race'?
Even if there was no bugs, I wouldn’t buy it. $70 is too much.
NO FUCKEN WAY ITS THE SEQUEL
4:55 and i just wanna know jrwi 😭
the consistency of how overpowered the chickens are across all facets of gameplay is impressive
“Alright, if you laugh aloud you gotta play it out loud. So then I can laugh too.” -my dad. He wouldn’t laugh at this…😂😂🤣
play the outlast trials rn
I spit out my hot chocolate for this. Comedy gold that is.
Finally our favorite entity has played this game!
the long awaited sequel
4:38 I actually cackled here. Banger vid man
Slime's video on Jedi Fallen Order was the first video of his I ever watched. The nostalgia I feel is unreal
This video is beautiful, I have never seen greater *art*
I somehow managed to not kill Rick every time he appeared
Didn’t expect Rick the Door Technician to haunt Charlie.
The fact that Charlie decide to do a video like this makes me want to watch his videos more than I already do
I was wondering when this was going to come out
Yo 1:21 is the follow up on the joke from the last game and I never thought it would return
How did Slimsicle not die of laughter plaything this game, because it looks like he had a blaster playing it 😁
Hell yeah
even tho it was like 13 minutes, this still felt like the work for 1-2 hours
The kazoos in the intro 😂😂😂
This won’t bode well for you - Anikan to those f*cking toddlers
A new Slimecicle video about Star Wars! Finally, I can go to the toilet! Thank you Slimecicle! 🙏
Why would they call it Jedi survivor if you *can't*
"I'm not even tempted by the dark side anymore, I'm just gonna go buy some chickens" 💀💀💀
That scream at the end? It was actually really good. Like really REALLY good. That was raw
Good video hope you get good views
didnt you already make this video?
that was fucking hilarious
Those death turkeys are something else, good video
Slimecicle playing spider man 2 will be top ten videos on the internet
When the world needed him the most, the kazoo returned. Sorry Charlie
Calcium Kestis is canon and no one can change my mind
Best intro since corn
You are not a Jedi Survivor.
Here since fallen order
this is just good, classic slimecicle
5:43 At that moment Charlie “slimecicle” slimecicle became the punisher
I love all the tears of the kingdom music!
Im so glad I’m not the only one who found the chickens the scariest enemies in the game haha.
classic slimecicle video. enormous W
Our boy Charles goofifying yet another game on max difficulty
2 Slimecicle uploads in the same year? We are truly blessed 🙏
B o r s e
Thanks for making this video dude. Had a great laugh. Really made my day.
that hologame was just Chesst with a fancy coat of pain. looks like the chicken strategy beats everything else.
weird the names called jedi survivor when no one who encountered the fake jedi survived.
Evil Anakin Skywalker: “I like sand. It’s comforting, and it gets everywhere”
I love slmccl and star wars!
this feels very old slimecicle
Slimbikles ability to break every single game he touches should be studied by professors.
Is that chicken thing in the game the devs reference to the Bushes of Love song? lol
Congratulations on defeating Rick the Door Technician!
Yes he not died
The sequel we’ve wanted and deserved
rick
The only thing I promote is violence :D
This is me being 100% honest. I cheesed the Oggdo fight the same way.  Also the paper clip joke was amazing
The Funniest Jedi in all of Star Wars
Bruh I look forward to these types of vids please make more. Haven’t laughed this much in a while😂
Pls Play Qsmp Again There Was A big Stuff Happening
3:40 That man's scream of terror is unlike any I've ever heard. He screamed like he just got put in the femur breaker.  (Also, what's the song at 5:33?)
I missed classic slimecicle so much, the goat is back
The return of the king
I clicked on this video thinking it was a different YouTuber but to my surprise it was Charlie. Did not disappoint. Did scare me tho
Old school prepandemic charlie slimecicle video brings a tear to my eye
Better be careful with your doors Charlie slimecicle, or else Rick will come find you.
Riiiiiiiick
"Nature was beautiful until it started coming at me from the top rope" That one's goin in the quote book
Great birthday gift Charles Slime “Slimecicle” cicle thank you
Glowup Slimescicle computer savor. The true power of force quit. 6:52
"everyone knows jawa, but i just wanna know.. jawhere" is a top tier slimecicle quote
i actually did a double take when i saw a slimecicle video less than a year after the last one.
Space Cock Meta
Oh happy day
Perfect.
THE JEDI SURVIVOR!!! THE JEDI SURVIVOR IS REA- (game crash)
I am so glad you did a video in this format, I love these
Amaze
4:56 charlie slimecicle you're a grown ass man
YESS A CLASSIC SLIMECICLE KAZOO INTRO
HES BACK😊
Can't believe the beast of the bog just Boswer f-smashed
I need a video like this for tears of the kingdom. Please Charlie slimcicle make it happen
Rick never died, simply faked it to grow stronger. No more is he the door technician... He is...  THE DOOR LORD!
1:53 I can say from experience that chickens are superior. 🐓
Screw the enemys the demon chickens are the new danger 😂
I missed the kazoo.
Also I liked the use of shadows leitmotif 1:59
Just wait until he chulks out
11:17 that unit is toast.
The avatar, master of all 4 slime channels, when the world needed him most, he vanished  HES BAAAAAAAAAAAACK
I think the best part about this video (despite the obviously perfected jokes) is the music choice for the editing. Like come on, I can’t even point out them all! Fire Emblem, Ori and the Blind Forest, Tears of the Kingdom, Octopath… so many more! The editor deserves a gold star for being based and absolutely cracked. ⭐️
the sequel we didnt know we wanted
Damn, talk about two sentence horror stories lmao "There is a spider."    "Where did it go"
yoooooooo! part 2
I liked just from the intro
im so glad he made the sequal
What a funny way to end the video at 11:51. I love it. Also, how did that trooper attack Cal. I don’t think that’s supposed to happen. 😂😂
A classic main channel Slimecicle upload on my bday no less is truly a blessing
Somebody @AfroSenju 6:00 That frog tho looked mad beatable
i miss these types of videos
This is what the people want
YES expecting this one i have been
That one kid:it's the guy from shameless!
funniest guy known to man
The Jedi Fallen Order video is one of my all time favorite vids on YouTube. I have been waiting a long time for this…
They got space cassowaries now
"Calcium Kestis" 💀💀💀
Flawless playthrough of a flawless game!
RICKKKKKKKKKKKK!!!!!!!!!
RICK!!!!
hi im here
Another work of art
I want.. no I need to see this animated lol
why would they add :Survivor to the game if it doesnt have vampire survivors ripoff?
11:10 easiest way to get a chickmate
Gaming at its peak.
Guy in the thumbnail kinda looks like Bizly.
This is the only gamer on earth to loose to the mighty Rick! The door technician!
This brings me back to the OG Slimecicle.
the light suser
finally, the best prequal starwars movie
0:12 It is a dark time for gaming in the galaxy.  Determined to play the new Star Wars game no matter the cost, Slimecicle has established a secret game lair in the remote corner of his basement. There is a spider.  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA a                                         spider  its ok guys i'll take care of it just one sec                       where did it go
I eat slime
you always make me laugh,thankyou slime
👍
Finally… a new main line slimcicle video
I can't belive slimecicle is uploading on his main channel again, my childhood can return
THE KAZOO AND SLIDE WHISTLE ARE BACK
a                Spider
and then he turned himself into a door technician, funniest shit I’ve ever seen.
Oh crap wait this is NEW?!
Ive been waiting for this episode and its here and its great
yes. yes is all i have to say.
"OH SHOOT I DON'T EVEN HAVE A WEAPON, OH WAIT ITS YOU...GODDDDDD DAMNNNNNN YOUUUUUU RICKKKKKKK" - Charlie Slime
another video another laugh great vid keep it up
SLIMES MAKING VIDEOS LIKE THIS AGAIN LETS GO
the slimy king has return once again
Remember when every NPC in the modded Skyrim VR would immediately try to kill the chickens? This is what those chickens would become
Welcome to Dagohbah
Everyone needed this
yesssss mr slimer, glad to see another star wars video!
Afro shogun: "WHAT THE FU-"
Philadelphia
Im a kazoo.
I just love seeing him dying, the chickens are stronger than I expected :D
7:15 enough said.
3:45  IS THAT FUCKING ORI MUSIC     Ori music goes hard and that hit me with a wave of nostalgia
Rick is the most powerful being in the star wars universe. No matter who faces him off, he will rise victorious.
Best intro 10/10
Rick was my favourite boss fight
When you realize this man changed his difficulty mulptiy times in the game. (points out dots on the hud)
the title holds up, what the hell did I just watch
The prophecy has come true the slimecicle  channel actually posted I know the light and dark sides of YouTube have finally united as for the first time in years slimecicle might have a more consistent upload schedule on his main channel
YIPPEEEEEE
the sequel we needed, but didnt deserve.
Whoa was that dd2 final boss theme for Rick's secret bossfight? Smooth.
This is what I was most excited for with the new Jedi game
THE MFING SEQUEL
he has the "high" ground.
and when we needed him most...
wake up: slimecicle upload, grab kazoo
Guys he remembered his password
He was not lying! This is a fantastic return to the classic Slimecicle style
Slime Wars the cicle strikes back
watching this video while dissociated out of my fucking mind and having been awake for over 36 hours was truly an experience. not one i'd recommend, but an experience nonetheless
Whenever I watch a slimecicle video, I like to listen to them without seeing the actual video. It really tests the limits of my imagination
Thought this was a repost for a second lol
ive been waiting so long for this
OMG HE AMDE A SEQUEL
AMOUNG US!! 0_0
The fact that the chickens just destroy everything even in the optional strategy game is insane😂
I had to check to see if Rick was real.  He is.
The one Star Wars sequel that doesn't disappoint. (That's a Star Wars joke for all non-Star Warses in the audience)
1:10 you stole my joke lol
I beat you to it!!! My video came out an hour before yours!!! Ha!  Your my YouTube inspiration, keep it up!
Always remember I’m never far from your location.
The funniest jedi in the galaxy makes his triumphant return
Another slimecicle episode!!
Fuck I want to watch this so bad but my headphone are broken so I can’t play the game till the new ones arrive 🤬
This is the funniest thing I’ve ever seen
Anyone else just watching the previous one then noticing the new one is here?
This video is about 1000 ways to die in Star Wars.
I literally gasped when I heard the kazoos again. God this channel is amazing.
The return of old content. I LOVE IT!
It’s funny how my first time watching slimecicle was him playing Star Wars Jedi fallen order and now I’m back watching him play the sequel, man I feel old 😂
RRRIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIICCCKKK
.....that was the final boss
THIS VIDEO ALREADY STARTS OFF AMAZING  OH HOW IVE MISSED THIS HOWWW IVE MISSED THIS <3
I want to watch this so badly. But I don’t want an ounce of spoilers for the game, no matter how little story is actually in this video.
He was the real villain the whole time… Rick.
If you could stay more active on this main channel upload style and away from over saturated let’s plays on the second channel, you wouldnt have gone as stale as quick in my opinion.
THE KAZOO RETURNS
Yooo hes baack
I'm so happy paused out of impulse as I heard the kazoo I'm ready for the slime wars
He made a second one!? the engine is going to break! 🤣🤣🤣🥳🥳 We love you Slimecicle
The funny is strong with this one
Imagine if charliesta made another sequel to this
My pet rock of 14 years died of old age a few hours ago, and my family is making fun of me.  Her name was Rookie, and she was a small crested rock. I really loved her a lot, for such a small thing she had so much personality. She would always walk onto my hand if I held it out for her and would jump to the cage door if I was home from work.  For the last week, she had been sluggish and not climbing at all. She stopped visiting me when I came home and stayed on the cage floor. I knew deep down it was her age, but I wanted to just believe she was just maybe a little out of it, so I tried to keep her healthy and hydrated. Just today, I came home and found her motionless, i went to touch her gently and saw she was still breathing and stiff. But she was clearly weak, and the breathing was shallow. I didn't want to bother her, I know rocks get stressed out by human touch when they are uncomfortable, so I left her.  An hour later, she was dead, I knew because when I went to touch her, she was limp. She had never been so limp before.  I told my sister and showed her the body as I was taking it to the backyard for a burial. She seemed shocked but oddly asked to take a pic. I told her no as it was weird.  I buried her, grieved for a few hours, and decided I would stay home from work tomorrow.  My parents came home, and I told them they were respectful. Well, my mom at least was sympathetic. My dad didn't do much but listen. I just came back upstairs, and I heard them talking. My dad and sister dont exactly have quiet voices.  They said that I was overreacting, how maybe if it was the dog, I should be upset and crying. And how my managers would think I would be stupid if I called in for the death of a rock.  I thought they would be respectful, but I guess they really didn't care for her or how much she meant to me. It makes me furious, but I dont have the energy to confront them. She may have been small and not the brightest, but I really did love Rookie, I've had her since I was in elementary school. I just wish they were more understanding about this.
I am only 17 seconds into the video and I am legit starting to cry from how funny this damn intro is
finally! anew slimecicle video?
This should of replaced the the last Jedi
A classic throwback Slimecicle video
Charlie made this so fucking funny
You should play ultrakill
The jedi get whimsicle from time to time.
3:10 the calcium joke really syhows you've mastered taking a joke and running with it
e
It finnaly arrives
Please do a video like this on the miles morales game
Ive searched the internet for years. And I finally found him. The force is strong with this one. 🧐
RIIIIIICCKKKKK
YEAAAAAAAAAH
I'm still praying for Chuckle Dungeon 3.0
Rick, soldier of god
Charlie how in the 9 hells did you get half of these bugs to happen?
Slimecicle is the Jedi ever
The trooper piece! The trooper piece is real!
is it just me or does Charlie sound more expressive? Like his acting is fucking amazing
aH YES, calcium kestis blessed with the densest bones of any Jedi
HES BACK!
HE HAS RETURNED WITH GREAT FORCE
Now I know why everyone teamed up to kill the chickens in Slimecicle’s Skyrim video. The timelines are converging.
he did it again, folks
The sequel is finally here, time to actually enjoy watching a Jedi survivor video
The dorce is too strong
Yes I love  the funneh star wars music
I've been looking forward for this!
Kazoo kazoo How do you do
We need Rick vs odgo bogdo
1:39 recall:
you really stuck with the a similar thumbnail huh. don't get me wrong its still great
finally. a new video to watch. nice frequent uploads👍
6:11 float like a butterfly, sting like a bee, oh no he eats both
I love and hate slimecicle videos because they are amazing videos but it means the next one is several months away 😂
physically could not make it through your intro.
If he is the funniest, why ist there among us beside him ?
I actually found you through your fallen order video, so i guess I'm not gonna watch you any more since it's gone full circle
Saw you in the Max0r video, that’s crazy.
What was the song in the end?
It'd be funnier if he went: Slimecicle: "Yuh. I saved you. And in return, all I ahsk: change your lyf. For the better. And subscribe...to Slimec--." Stormtrooper: *Disappears* Slimecicle: "Whuh--?"  The acting during the clip where the Mantis was leaving without him was Oscar-worthy.  Of course, that tactic worked. You said there’s not a tactic on EARTH that could work on you. And last I checked, Earth doesn’t even EXIST.🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  Since you did the sequel to Jedi, you WILL do Spider-Man 2.😂
busted out the sacred slide flute on this one
I remember how good the fallen order video was and how much I laughed at it, and *this* epic sequel right here was beautiful
How did you manage to glitch every game? I did not encounter a single bug over 45 hours hahahaha
Rest In Peace Rick the Door Technician He lived a life of doors and then he died 😔
This is great but I really hope we get a full VOD playthrough on the second channel.
Good video, Made me audibly laugh. 👍
LMFAOOO
I have absolutely no idea of any Star Wars lore yet this made complete sense to me.
The fact the same exact rope glitch happened in both games is hilarious to me
The damn chickens
ebic
kinda way late for this lol
Now he just needs to make a fortnite vide💥💥💥🔫
The real Jedi we the friends we survived along the way
Backrooms?
1:18 bro thought we wouldn't notice the tears of the kingdom music
Nothing like a nice glass of blue milk from Calcium Kestis to start the day.
HES BACK!
As a wise man once said, “Charlie could be watching paint dry and make an entertaining video with 80 puns and 30 different bits”
We didn't deserve this
Early
my... GOD that ending...  well... its just goes ta show... the only thing more powerful than a raging cock, is a door....
Finally the long awaited sequel!
The intro😭
This whole thing feels like a nostalgia trip and I love it!!!
Pin plz
Next level comedy 💀💀
Seeing how the mantis functions from the outside is actually pretty cool, thank you Carl
I had no clue whether or not Charlie would make a sequel, but it is all I have been hoping for since this game came out.
THE RETURN
This is one hell of a throwback, old school slimecicle video, just making jokes, and I love it
Good
DAMN right when a guy died doing the Taco Bell sound I got the Taco Bell add in PERFECT SYNC
Released 19 minutes ago lets go
4:20 look at this monkey Abooga booga booga Anooga booga boooga- SLAM SLAM    idk
HE BROUGHT THE KUZOO BACK!!!!!!
This has truly been, a slime cicle.
I love charlies videos!!!❤❤
Thank you Chumrlie
the first video was my favourite of yours of all time, but it’s likely going to be a few years before I’m able to watch the whole of this one (due to spoilers) so I’ll come back when I buy and finish this game
Is this game worth it?
why the hell have i been sleepin on this channel?! this videos hilarious brother! im back, and im sorry i left
There is a spider
best content ever. keep it up!
Fun fact: Since this game is canon, so is Rick the Door Technician.
rick: the doorman chronicals
I can't believe he gooped gunked and squelched so hard he went through the galaxy
Hey guys it’s me Adam Sandler I’m in your skull now
who knew chickens were all it took to defeat the empire
This channels great.
Thank you slimecicle! Your uploads always make my year.
Is it 2019 again?
"This is Cal Kestis from Star Wars and you're watching Among Us!"
balance has been restored to the force
THE ONE WITH THE VOWELS HAS ARISEN AGAIN TO GIFT US WITH A NEW MASTERPIECE 🙏🙏
this reminds me of the older Slimecicle videos
Goddammit Rick
no way.. a slimecicle star wars jedi video.. it's been so long
Its a good day when slimecicle uploads, if only it were slmccl tho so sad
who would win rick lord of doors or solder of god, rick
I love these old slime style videos they're so funny 💀
That scene where you glitched out of the ship as it flies off is actually fascinating
Yes!! Old style video!
How do you unlock the Amogus saber?
A sequel to the first slimecicle I ever saw
Gotta love when a slimecicle video appears and he's breaking the game and joking around
Slimecicle was surprisingly good at this game. Shame his lightsaber had erectile disfunction
sex
HES ALIVE
Eid sheeren goes around Slaughtering people withhis swartz that has 4 modes for some reason:
THE SEQUAL IS HERE LETS GOOOOOOOO
Bro disappears for nearly a year then drops two banger videos
Anyone remembers his first star wars video?
4:15 is that beholder
go film another video like the ghost one
As a Star Wars fan, this is very lore accurate
Hello
It’s Jedi Time
You uploaded this on me and my boyfriend 1st year anniversary I couldn't think of a better time, to strap him on an electric chair and make him watch this video for me! Thank you so much Mr. Charlie sludge!
4:57  BONK.
e
I hate milk, I only eat cheese
the editing is too fkn good
Obi wan kenobi has nothing on Charlie
1:08 This reminded me of the scene from the first Avengers movie where Tony Stark points out a guy playing Galactica. That wasn't scripted. The extra was legitimately playing Galactica during filming.
New vid, yay
mhhhmm funny jedi
Never even seen Star Wars and yet I’m sure this is THE funniest Jedi
5:10 batmen
Truly one of the Jedi of all time!
YES IT HAPPENED!
PAYNUS
No no no no no wait wait wait

I was waiting for this for soo long
If anyone comments "cLaIM yOuRE ONe hOUr TiCKeT HeRE" shit, here you can unclaim a ticket from a random fucker of your choice, and throw it into the stratosphere.
Somebody once told me
no one has finished the video yet
[MESSAGE DELETED]
Slimesicle is the best jedi. Change My Mind.
I thought this video wasn’t coming, I’m so happy
Bro I couldn't stop laughing at this video... now I feel like a little child-

No upload in a while, is Slmccl harassing you?  Don't know who that creep is, but he keeps impersonating you.

So glad to see a sequel to this
This isn’t Slimecicle, it’s the spider!
Not the kazoo
Haven't watched the video yet, but i can see "This doesn't Bode well" in the future  I was right
This is truly an experience.
Did you get the spider?
Cock trooper supremacy

I knew what the intro to star Wars audio would be without hearing it
Nice video 📷

He finally got another goopy video to ooze out the sludge
I love when the jedi said "It is jediyng time", truly one of the games of all time.
He truely slimed the sickle out of this game
i was waiting for this video to get the game, now i will be severely disappointed as i realize slimecicle makes things too good to be true
I can’t believe Star Wars could be this funny!!!!!!!
