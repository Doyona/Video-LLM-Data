🍰 Who here would've been ok with getting surprise marshmallow fluff?
In some Arab countries we call them راس العبد I won’t say it in English tho😅
the cake is a lie the cake is a lie the cake is a lie the cake is a lie the cake is a lie the cake is a lie
You will get banned if you write what these are called in finnish
Those are really common in Europe and in Denmark they are called “fløde bole.”
the cake is a lie
*deadly neurotoxin*
P O R T A L  R E F F E R E N C E
(Insert reference to Portal here)
In here Finland these things are now called kissess but like 20 years ago they were nigg** kisses
The cake is a lie...
That’s a tea cake
The store was ran by GLaDOS💀
so GLaDOS made the cakes then?
The cake is a lie.
Where I live we call them warm ice-creams.
The cake is a lie
That’s a tea cake it’s is a chocolate thing and the inside is a marshmallow . Fluff
Science isn't good now, GLaDOS needs to sell "cakes"
“The cake is a lie”
Was it baked by GLaDOS?
The title be giving me *PORTAL* memories
I thought they were caneles
We call those in the UK snowballs
Wow did not know some people aren't familiar with this dessert
This is SUPER FAMOUS AND LOVED IN BRAZIL ❤️🇧🇷
The cake is a lie
In my country (Israel) we call it a crembo you can tell what it is by its look but in Israel the bottom is a  Biscuit not a waffle
This is Called krembo קרמבו in Israel it’s a really common treat it usually comes in box’s of 10
In Israel this is a really loved desert, it called "Krembo" here, ans you can translate it to "cream inside". A lot of children eat this, and it really popular in the winters because in the summer it melts.
In my country we call it cramboo
No one here thought about Portal when reading the caption..the cake is a lie ;(
It's calld a Mohrenkopf
We call these winter icecream in Iran..they are actually good.I enjoy them more than real icecream.
Then we have that what they call "water cake" that contains literally none of the basic ingredients of a cake.
In Australia we have something similar, they're called eskimo snowballs and they come in a packet, but they don't have the waffle bottom, just a fluffy marshmallow filling :))
Not so fun fact, they used to be literally called „n-word kisses“ in germany before they changed the name to chocolate kisses later on. And german boomers still call em by the slur name cause they are like: „we used to call them that as kids it‘s fine!“ like yeah. I love them tho I adore the taste! And I don‘t even like marshmallow fluff. I think they are made of eggwhites tho. I‘m shook yall didn‘t know these like I felt like they are a thing in the US too. But regardless of that, boomers calling it by the old name makes me cringe so hard every time.
ayyye we have those in uruguay too! finally someone agrees they suck
Switzerland with their name for it 🤐
In Uruguay they sell these things, I don't know the product's name but the brand is called Ricardito, but it's just meringue covered in chocolate.
In Poland we name it hot ice cream
This was a triumph
That's a CHOCOLATES KISS [schokokuss in Germany]
Im from denmark where it originated and we don't even cosider that a cake. Most people consider them to be sweet treats or candy
In Poland we call this "warm ice cream". I don't like it too.
It's not a cake. It's a dessert. I would be disappointed if I was told that it's a cake. I would probably still like it.
"The cake is a lie" Me: *portal vibes kick in*
🟠  🚶‍♂️  🔵
Teacakes
*laughs in portal*
Yeah, in England we call these tea cakes, I'm sure your not the first tourist to be tricked by this, the chocolate cover conceals many lies!!!!!
The comments section is very educational. Hello world! Nice to meet you.
In Brazil that's called "Tits of a black woman" "teta de nega"
We call it a type of cake in austria(europa)..
Portal is fucking dead
The stall owner : “We do a little trolling around here”
Came here for portal 2 not this weird review
Those are great.  Marshmallow
I was there!!!
Bought something like that once. Here in the netherlands we call it Chocolade Zoenen and its gross in my opinion, that gross cheap marshmellow fluff in the middle, dry piece of cracker on the bottom and a chocolate layer on it. I wouldnt recommend 😂
It's a teacake. As someone from Manchester I have to defend this. Teacakes are well known in England, the issue isn't the teacake it's a cultural disconnect
Title: *cake is a lie* *me*memory kicks in
קרמבו😂
Not me a portal fan coming out of nowhere because, of the title.
Those look like teacakes which.. Aren't actually cakes XD I guess you'd only really know this if you grew up with them tho lol
It’s a tea cake you took
*inhales*            WHY DID NOBODY TELL ME ABOUT THE CHANNEL EARLIER? I COULD'VE MET THIS gurl
Hi i live in Europe and we usually eat when it’s youre birthday, But it IS wierd that it’s called cake
In most European countries these are a thing. I live in the Netherlands and over here it's called a Zoen. Which means kiss. I always try to eat the chocolate without disturbing the marshmallow. Fun little game to play.
In Brazil we called this “Maria Mole” it’s made with egg whites, gelatin and sugar.
Obviously not an European person lmao
We used to call this a negro Kis in the netherlands it changed tho idk why
the cake is a lie the cake is a lie the cake is a lie the cake is a lie
i feel like your first experience with it was ruined, they're really good and are common at faires in Sweden and probably all around Europe. the coconut ones are super good!
In England we call them tea cakes and you usually eat them in an afternoon tea or while drinking tea.
This is called teta de nega in Brazil. I never thought of it like a cake but more like a marshmallow something hahaha I love it tho
This is so american, i wanna cry 😭 what is this?? Im not talking about the cake
I knew exactly what these were just looking at them. I dont like em either :/
Called moretto/morettini in Italy (Chicchirichì in Naples) 😆 I could eat them 'til I throw up! 😆
Why is it shaped like a makeup sponge though 😭
in iran we call them winter ice cream
I mean it Is a "Schaumkuss" but i dont know how anyone would translate it  Foamkiss? Anyway i think must people that live in europe would immedatly regonise them And they taste pretty good too So i wouldnt be mad
I take personal offense to this, these are the best thing ever. Dickmans for the win.
We call them kokosboller in norway
Did you bought it in Manchester, right? Here, in Argentina(south america), we have a similar treat, and we call that ”bombón” or “milk caramel cone”(cono de dulce de leche), which does not mean cake, or a very old one that we don't make anymore, called “cremo-coa”(creme+cocoa), so yeah, the name is very misleading in english.
Girl, I also just had a disappointing food order from this Peruvian cafe pastry shop. They sent me some bootleg sugar cookie when it was just a dry sugar disk with melted sprinkles on top, their funnel cake was too crunchy to rip apart or eat, and their chicken Caesar wrap was so plain cause the wrap is just too filling as filler. You & me both.
it’s called a tea cake. we eat this with a hot beverage like coffee. it’s not a lie it’s just a tea cake
No, it’s not a cake. It’s a Flødebolle. We often have them at birthdays in Denmark 🇩🇰😍🥰
In Israel its called crambo
Its creambow in Israel
Ok so it's a classic in poland, we call it warm ice cream doe
THE CAKE IS A LIE portal vibes
I’m England we call that a tea cake
Hi English guy here these are tea cakes not cake cakes they’re an English staple though and are enjoyed by many.
we call it wintery icecream in iran
It is called a tea cake
Its a tea cake I love those you dhould have wagon wheels
sounds like a case of crisps vs chips to me 😅  that said, I am SOOOOOO jealous of the selection of choco kisses???? that is a mad good offer of varied toppings. I haven't seen any like these before, just the regular ones with white chocolate, dark chocolate or milk chocolate coating
It's called "Nhá benta" in Brazil
The cake is a lie you say? Well,  This was a triumph I'm making a note here; "Huge success" It's hard to overstate My satisfaction Aperture Science: We do what we must Because we can For the good of all of us Except the ones who are dead But there's no sense crying Over every mistake You just keep on trying Till you run out of cake And the science gets done And you make a neat gun For the people who are Still alive I'm not even angry I'm being so sincere right now Even though you broke my heart, And killed me And tore me to pieces And threw every piece into a fire As they burned it hurt because I was so happy for you Now, these points of data Make a beautiful line And we're out of beta We're releasing on time So I'm GLaD I got burned Think of all the things we learned- For the people who are Still alive Go ahead and leave me I think I'd prefer to stay inside Maybe you'll find someone else To help you? Maybe Black Mesa? That was a joke *Haha - Fat Chance* Anyway this cake is great It's so delicious and moist Look at me: still talking When there's science to do When I look out there, It makes me GLaD I'm not you I've experiments to run There is research to be done On the people who are Still alive And believe me I am Still alive I'm doing science and I'm Still alive I feel fantastic and I'm Still alive While you're dying I'll be Still alive And when you're dead I will be Still alive Still alive
Omg I laughed soooooo hard. You can see from a mile that this is a Dickmann 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
It’s a danish dish called flødebolle which translates to creambun it’s form of cream often with a Marci pan bottom and covered in chocolate
It’s a tea cake u eat em with tea int UK
Fun fact, english people don't know what cakes and puddings are. They literally call a blood sausage a pudding.
It's not what you think, it's a tea cake.
My disappointment is immeasurable
Those are "tea cakes" they have smaller versions in stores
I’m England it call a tonics tea cake
This is like going to somewhere in asia, looking up a name on Google and then saying a dish there is a lie because it’s not what you heard 💀
in deutschland we call it schokoküsschen und die dinger sind krank man
Americans call chocolate "candy" 🤷🏻‍♀️ People have different definitions.
קלמבו
In Sweden we call them munk=doughnut. We use the same name on both of them haha.
We have those here, every Christmas. Kokos- boller(:  coconut-creamy-fluff w chocolate. Not cake though
I love these🥺❤✨
I’m Lisa as fuck because why did you lie to me??
In Israel it's called "krembo" (in Hebrew)
Arggggh why is the English language so different for no reason? Now I have to confirm everything I order when I go
Thought you put sugar in bread that's cake
Portal portal portal portal portalPortal portal portal portal portalPortal portal portal portal portalPortal portal portal portal portalPortal portal portal portal portalPortal portal portal portal portalPortal portal portal portal portalPortal portal portal portal  portal portal portal portalportalPortalportalPortal
In danish the cake is called “Flødeboller” Its a sweet cake
We call it a sweetie-pie here,  not a cake, but an awesome sweet by Cadbury.
ahhh.. good old times .. marshmallow fluff...
I have it here to we eat it in winter ( 'cause they only make it in winter ) and we call it a Crembo it's not a cake but its delicious
I love that Usher is blaring in the background
I knew it from the shape. I HATE marshmallows
I knew it from the shape. I HATE marshmallows
קרמבו
I agree, they are totally disappointing!
You’re so dramatic. Annoying.
ES UN RICARDITO BOOO, NO SABIA Q LOS HACÍAN EN OTROS LADOS
That's just a giant Tunnocks tea cake. Sign me up 😂
In the UK, the idea of cake and gateaux is interchangeable.   Plus, the major mistake you made was being in Manchester.   Actually that is unfair, because Manchester is a pretty decent city, but being that I’m not from Manchester, it is my duty to give the city shit.
Gente! O cara ta vendendo “teta de nega” e falando que é bolo. This certainly isn’t cake, in Brazil has a name for this os called “teta de nega”
This is a tradition to eat in Denmark
This is like a giant teacake
Wow
in brazil 🇧🇷 that’s called “teta de nega” or in your language “black girl boobs”! traditional for our trips!
Those are tea cakes. Usually have a biscuit bottom but it’s known as a cake where you bought it
I love those things
No hate but I understand if you don’t really like marshmallow fluff but I don’t think you needed to be disappointed 😂
They’re tea cakes. I’m British and I love them, nothing wrong with getting marshmallow fluff. Also ik it’s a bit confusing (we have two tea cake versions, one similar to a hot cross bun without the cross and those ones)
These are chocolate kisses! It’s an European thing lmao
Ohh that's a super common treat in Israel Its called crembo
Lol. The quote from the report of the week is funny
Det et en flødebolle
This is my kind of dessert 😍 I’m obsessed with marshmallows 😍
In brazil they are called teta de nega, we love this in here.
Where i live we call it krembo!
I can't remember ever seeing them advertised as cakes. They are based on a German speciality call chocolate kiss, and rather humously the biggest commercial producer in Germany is called Dickmann though that just mean big man in German.
In germany we call it "Schaumküsse"  and that means  "foamkisses". I think its cute ^^
That is a cake
This is called (sorry for that) 'n*gro kiss' in Hungary. And i know it's offensive, but somehow it got it's name and ppl stick to it. Btw i think it's disgusting.
I totally agree with her, I also don’t like marshmallow fluff.
פאקינג קרמבו גנבים
راس اب العبد
Maybe that what is cake look like a for them...😅
😯😯😯i would be so disappointed I love real cake 😋
In london it’s very common to call these cakes. Their like something you have with tea but not often.
Ooo
Famosa Teta-de-nega também não gosto não
Omg we would never call these a cake, we call them cream buns (lowkey sounds wrong cuz of memes) but it’s like creamfluffs or something. They’re super popular and good and I love them personally. They can both be cheap and usually giving to you’re class or maybe you’re teammates when it’s you’re birthday but it’s definitely a luxury too and luxury brands who also makes ice cream and candy. Basically they’re amazing but I can see when it wasn’t what you expected it’s kinda sad lol.
That is Brazilian and it is called bomboca
Everyone has such cute names for these, but ask your grandparents what they were called back in the day 🤐
Its not really a lie because in England those are called teacakes
Well call them mums-mums in Sweden! Or gräddbullar. (Essentially yum-yums or creambuns) ^-^
it's name winter ice cream and in side is white egg
Not sure about the rest of the world but these are called tea cakes in Scotland
My Mom loves those kinds of cakes, they are teacakes 😍🤍
When I was a kid these was so popular where I live. I was crazy to taste it, but when I did, didn't understand the hype
"Soft, sweet food made from a mixture of flour, shortening, eggs, sugar and other ingredients. Baked and often decorated." That's exactly what they are, tho. If you didn't know what it was, why didn't you ask him? You can go "hey, what's in them? I've never had one, can you describe it?"
Where is it ? We wana try it
It’s called krembo
People knowing this as teacakes and stuff in Europe and here in Brazil I knew it as Ana maria 🗣️
Only Jesus Christ saves repent of your wickedness and believe in the Gospel we must be born again to enter Heaven and turn to the Lord
This is what we in Denmark call a Flødebolle (Cream Bun - another lie 😅). In old days they were called Negro Kiss and later Negro Bun - and not even in an offensive way; the manifacturer meant it as a cute thing. I'm so sorry on behalf of the old Danes!
In Brasil we call it "Peitinho de moça" (Lady's titties)
We have that in Portugal, kids and adults love them we called it “Bombocas” but everyone knows that’s not a cake but a sweet treat 😝
Europeans recognise this, i get why it's confusing for tourists tho
Immediately looking at it, it reminded me of chocopie
not me realizing i have those- LIKE I THINK THEY'RE SO GOOD- the marshmallow is firm though-
….americans
Sorry but that one's kind of on you, nobody where I live would mistake those for cakes 😂
As @AikooPot says: europeans know it very well and most of them, I would say, like it. So no one except tourists would expect a regular cake. Also it is nothing like a marshmallow...It is more like a cream-sugar-filling.
I love that the comments show different variations of what the dessert can be called on different countries. It's very similar to a snack called choco mallows here.
Those are the best!!!!
Agree.. its like the raindrop cake.. it’s not a cake.. it a jelly/agar..
English really is different when in the UK. Pudding means something else & so does cake apparently. Now I'm paranoid.
I’d be pissed. I hate marshmallow fluff
Schaumküsse oder Schokoküsse
All these comments , so then what’s a cake 🎂 🍰 named in England since those were tea cakes
Krembo!!!!!
It’s called a tea cake, a classic english dessert
I knew what they where the moment I saw them
In Uruguay, we call it "Ricardito"
in Perú we called it 'beso de moza' (like a kiss from a pretty girl)
Those are German there are called Dickmanns well the old name was negerküsse quite racist so the name was changed
In my country it’s called Beso de Moza, but those are way more luxurious.
We call it foam-bombs in German lol
It's like winter ice cream
Me who loves sweets, just give me anything sweet and i'd love it sm
It’s called a dickman in germany and it tastes like shit 💀
This was my reaction lol! I was so duped
Negerzoenen 😂🤣😘😘😥🙊🙊🙊
We call the Sweetie Pies here in South Africa and you can get them in the shops in 4 different flavors I believe. Dark Chocolate, Milk Chocolate, Strawberry and Mint. They’re very common to hand out on Valentines day here lol.
how disappointing
Okay karen
That's what we call "Beso de moza" in Peru, It's really common here
THE CAKE IS A LIE
Its  british cake.
It is a „ warm ice-cream”! It never supposed to be a cake!
It’s a tea cake!. That’s what there called in the UK.
Its not a cake it is Nhá Benta. You can find this at Kopenhagen store.  We eat this in Brazil.
i haven’t heard the phrase “the cake is a lie” in so long
That is a teacake
Only gamers get the title reference
Tell me ur American without telling me ur American 😭
Ooh that’s such an iconic treat in the Netherlands (and judging by the other comments, the rest of Europe too)! It’s called a ‘Zoen’ in Dutch which translates to kiss! It used to have a more controversial name, but it’s a childhood fave of mine!
🤷🏻‍♀️
Those are tea cakes hahha. I was surprised the first time I had one two but that is what they are supposed to be like. Tea cakes are like a company like Kit Kat’s or snickers
Girl.
It’s flødeboller
In Poland we call these "ciepłe lody" which means "warm ice cream".
And that's called false advertising folks.
DICKMANNS
They’re called “cream buns” (like in whipping cream) in Denmark. It’s sugar and egg whites mixed together, and some other stuff. They are usually served at birthdays and are generally very common here. They used to be called “Negro Kisses” decades ago, but the name was changed for obvious reasons!
Its a cutie pie 🥧 . We also have them here is SA 🇿🇦
It's a mellow cake 🙂
EUEUEUEUEU ESO SE LLAMA RICARDITO  THAT IS CALLED RICARDITO
Don't mess with a hot Filipina's food.
Disapponting? All for views. Lol
Omg you are dissapointed with a bomboca? (It's what we call it in my country) It was our childhood go to treat It is heavenly! Stop this heresy!!!!
Bro cakes can be without flour like stop thinking that every cake needs flour 💀
Lol welcome to europe
I knew what they were right away 😂 that’s a tea cake
I agree.
Its a dissapiontment
I love those
In Poland we called it warm ice cream
This is literally called "WARM ICE-CREAM" in Poland hah
in the netherlands we call them ‘chocolate kisses’ absolutely love them
In South Africa we call it a sweetie pie
Those are my hubby’s favorite
Tea cakes ❤ always had them at birthday parties when I was a kid
I would rather have that then a cake 8
That’s a German treat. It’s not cake. We call them Dickmans schoko Küsse. 🤣🤣
in brazil we call those teta de nega, which means black woman’s titty hahahaha is really popular here
Any place that has an adjective to describe the food in the name is never good.
If you live in eroupe like i do you know what this is! In Denmark we Call theese “flødeboller” haha
In Denmark its "flødebolle" which translates to cream bun 😄
If you were in the UK, they have a system of definitions that can't be trusted. 😉
I don't know if someone already said this but in the Netherlands it is a tipicaly Dutch treat. They were calling it " Neger Zoen". Literally:"Negro Kiss". Many people were protesting against it so now it's called: "Choco Zoen", Chocolate Kiss. I grew up with it, it was also a populair treat at school on kids b-day.
I’ve tried this thing for a few times in Canada and I could already tell what that is by how it looks like, it isn’t called cake here tho 💀 They shouldn’t have called this “cake”, I forgot what its called but still-
Your video/content is disappointing
This is Tarboush
I’m in South Africa we call that a cutie pie.
That's called a tea cake, which isn't really a cake, kind of like black pudding is not really a pudding.
It was called a snow cake in Wales. Lol should've guessed then haha
If you are not satisfied then don’t upload it.  Dragging down others business just because you are well educated enough 🙄  Girllll you sounds like stooooopid😬🤢
This is a brazilian candy (teta de nega)
We really need to understand other countries of what they have before we judge and before we act like Gordon Ramsay
In Israel they’re called “Krembo” and when these show up at the supermarkets you know it’s winter time! Ours has a cookie on the bottom. I love these!
We call these tea cakes and I know it’s not even close to being a cake. It’s like calling Ketchup in America but Tomato Sauce in UK 🤷‍♂️
Yeah, here in the uk for some reason they got these things called "tea cakes"that are not cakes 🤣🤦🏽‍♀️
True
This is a Dutch dessert called negerzoenen
Ah... This is something new... I thought in the europe the teacake refer to something like petit four. (idk why) So in the comments, i read that actually this one is called as a teacake
This is a tea cake in the UK. Look up tunnocks tea cakes.
Does it matter if it's delicious? I wouldn't mind a little surprise.
This uploader is fake
why dragging the business down and posting it online thats unappropriated  i was soo disappointedwith you   KAREN🤦‍♂️you should at least not showing the business name
Ignorant
How have you made it this far in life being that slow?
Yeah, That should have been labeled chocolate covered marshmallow.
It's a teacake. See Tunnoks Teacake.
In my country we call it I winter ice cream. The marshmallow is too sweet and after eating that you don't want to look at sugar.🤢😅
I remember those, in the netherlands we used to call them N word kisses.... havent seen alot them a year after that since🤣🤣 think they are just called chocolate kisses now or smth
I don't like them. Something off about marshmallow inside   Can't believe your having hot chocolate but your having in paper cup  You buy a hot chocolate in a Xmas Market mug. After your done with the drink   You can ask to swap it for clean one and keep the mug  New design every year   That and the small Dutch  pancake why I go Xmas Market
Try jaffa cakes from 1 pound shop
In brazil we call this "teta de nega"
Its not a mistake its a masterpice
in iran we call it winter ice cream,cause it's not cold so you can eat it
Girl I think you owe an apology to the store. They call it cake in Europe. It's same thing as elevator in American English to lift in British.
We call it winter ice cream in my country 🤣🤣🤣
In Israel we call it "crembo" it's everywhere here and Europe never heard anyone calling it a cake
I would LOVE that
O famoso teta de nega
What about jaffa cakes are they cakes?
For Pete sake, eat it, don’t eat it. Just be grateful.
Here it's called "swedish bomb" and it's some sort of cream dessert with meringue covered with chocolate on a thin waffle base. It's nice but no cake, but does that really matter?😁
This ain't a cake. It's a "teta de nega" or a "monte belo" depending on who you ask in Brazil. I usually only see them in June/July when they're sold in fairs  Luxury my ass lmao
Aside from British food, that is pretty disappointing
It's a tea cake!
Cake is way better name than what they were called in Finland not too long ago. Now they are just "Kisses" but before they were "N-word kisses."
I used to live there it was better before covid and they didnt have the normal things open 😭
It's depend on how you define cake and how deep you are in cake journey
This is called "winter ice cream" in Iran
It’s a crembo and it’s very popular in Israel as a winter treat☺️
it’s really not that deep just eat it
It's a tea cake :)
Those looked really light and over priced
Yeah that’s just a bunch of bs. They need to get better at marketing because I would’ve been extremely disappointed as well 😤
We call them in Germany, Chocolate Kisses and every people know them 😊
When it has that shape, at least in my country, you just know it has someking of marshmallow or cream stuff inside
This is called winter ice_cream in my country
Disappointed but you cunsumed it LOL
we have this in lebanon it's meringue not marshmallow fluff but as u said it's good and fun to eat!
Bruh what a rippoff xD I mean I love those things, but still fuck those folks selling them as cake... fucking scammers.
Oh i love those!
Don't speak while our mouth is full just para feeling popular drama now a days is no longer excess!
Kakain ka nalang maingay ka pa po elhan ka hinoong ignorante
Oa ka dhay
UGH, YES. I had this debate with my mom just last night. This is not a cake, at least not for me
Portal
Everyone knows those are not cake 😂
Oh hell no lol
In Holland/The Netherlands,we have these as well..They used to go under the name "Negerzoenen"...In English it is pronounced/translated as "A negro's kiss".. This name was quite controversial.. And quite insulting ..So later they were renamed as "Choclate kisses"..🙊
It's a teacake. They're the best!😍
That's no cake, false advertising.
some people call this a tea cake! it’s normally a biscuit, with a soft marshmallow covered in a thin coat of chocolate <3
I think you have to keep in my the cultural difference.
Yesssss, you quote Report of the week. 😂
Nhá benta. Respeita.
In danish it's kald flødebolde it's very good and many people eat it and it's popular to give in classes when somebody has birthday
lmao americans
I love them.... :)
Everyone knows what they are here in Europe. In the U.K. we have similar ones called Tea cakes.
These are marshmallows... I feel like you don't travel well
These are like another kind of tea cake, look up tunnocks tea cakes.
כל הישראלים בתגובות... קרמבו! (אם מישהו שמכיר אותי רואה את זה; שקט...)
Luke 7:4 You are worthy
this feels a little spoiled. „my day is ruined“. really?
I mean they call cookies "biscuits" and chips "crisps". Spelling tires with a "y" and adding the letter U in words where it isn't required. Theyre on some other shit
It’s not a cake😂I’m from the uk and it’s a chocolate covered waffle with marshmallow filling things a re called different Ames here to you it’s so confusing sometimes 😂😂
Gee, her tone is so snotty.
Lol this bish hasn't seen a buche de noel. We bought one and it was mostly cream and a thin wafer like bottom layer.
AYOO 😳
This is a 'beso de moza' in Peru
In Belgium they are called mellow cake. I can eat an entire box with coffee 🙈. I only discovered it in Europe. We don't have this in Africa
It looks nice
This is krembo-Israeli/German candy.but I will not call it a cake…🤣🤣
This is an Palestinians and Jewish sweet I guess
Right there with you. I like to know what I'm getting to a certain degree and if you say it's a cake I expect somewhere from angel food to flourless chocolate tort but it better be cake. 🤣🤣🤣
This is a famous sweet in Jordan and Palestine  It’s amazing 🤩
Ha morenköpfe🤣
It's a sweetie pie where I'm from 🥰
Is it your first time I have seen it in Kim and Liz's mukbang channel
Welcome to England. Everything is shit
Its called "insert racial slur" in Switzerland.    No this is not a joke
Cuidado, os gringos descobriram a “teta de nega” / dantop/ nhá-benta
Complaining a sweet treat isn't technically a cake.... first world problems
In Poland this thing name is warm ice cream.
Your so drama
I thought its an ice cream😉
In the UK these are called teacakes hence where the term cake is used.
That's a chocolate covered marshmallow
Apparently the most European thing ever. Give me coffee, tea or hot chocolate and I can eat a whole box of those
That's a chocolate kiss, or Kohleküsse
In sweden we have something really similar we fill it with like a "coconut tasting foam" and call it coconut tips. But yeah would not describe it as a cake.
Okay, estoy esperando por mis hermanos uruguayos y argentinos que conozcan los "ricarditos"
In the Netherlands we call it  “chocolade zoenen” (chocolate kisses)
Man, hahaha. Contents like this. So in the box
i don't think i should tell the brazilian name for this cake....if you know, you know
I wish I was dealing with these types of life disappointments.  😄
In my country we call it mallows. Marshmallow covered with chocolate.  It's my childhood favourite❤
It’s healthier and better then a cake and light, silly
This is a fancy tunnocks teacake, although it isn't what most people would describe as a cake, me as well as most other Scots would still class it as a type of cake
Be thankful that it wasn't empty🤣
ur just expecting too much
In brazil we call them nha benta
In danish this is called “flødebolle” and it’s not a cake. It either waffle or marzipan at the bottom and then it’s foam that is actually, fluffy egg whites, and then there’s a thin layer of chocolate over it. And typically there’s either shredded coconut on the chocolate or they are just plain chocolate. one of the best “flødeboller” you can get are from “Spangsberg” you can get it with a lot of different chocolate and topping, for example you can get white chocolate with raspberry foam in the middle and liquorice on top. I hope this helps a bit.
in lebanon we call these طربوش (spelled like this: Tarboosh)(tarboosh is the name of our traditional red hat that men would wear in the past😅weird name ik actually they had another name but since it was offensive it was changed to tarboosh(the old name was رأس العبد meaning the head of a black slave PLZ DONT COME FOR ME IK THIS IS A BAD NAME THATS WHY WE DONT CALL IT THAT ANYMORE😅😓)) i would always buy them in a pack of 3 or at the supermarket as a big box 😁
They call things by weird names in the UK.  A car's trunk is a "boot".  WTF?
Oh! I wanna test it, look so yammy!!!
in persia these are called "winter ice cream"
Well, they r technically cakes… tea cakes😂
🙄
Oh noooooo! That's false advertisement! I love cakes & I definitely wouldn't be happy!
I've never had one but I love soft fluffy desserts. Wish these were easier to find in America.
I was at the market and got a cool pocket watch
this is called winter ice cream in iran and most of the children love it
I would still eat that and feel like im in heaven☺🤤
The video is disappointing
Its my favorit
Those look like a Mexican snack called Chocolatines, which are so good but I can understand the disappointment since it’s definitely not a cake
You complain in every video
You complain alot.. and you also mentioned in a video having to do things the "white" way here in USA. You're oozing extremely poor perspective in life down to the food you eat. Jesus woman.
don't slander our beloved chocolate kisses
It’s not a cake 😂😄 it’s sweet egg white fluff with a thin chocolate crust :)
It’s called a tea cake. It’s a British thing.
Its called hot ice cream In poland
Omg everyone could see what it is. But I know in the US you have to literally put the most stupid instruction on products to prevent people from pressing charges so I get it...  🤦🏼‍♀️🙄
That’s what??
I'd be tight too👿 ready to eat cake and eat a damn marshmallow. Different places all over the world discribe foods differently. Sounds like you got caught up in translation😂
First world problems… lol
it's a tea cake.
It's a fancy tunnocks tea cake
It’s a teacake. I knew by the shape. My husband likes them he’s from Newfoundland Canada, don’t get him started on what is considered a “pudding”, boiled split peas are included
Oh its a teacake! They're lovely
In Germany those are called "Mohrenkopf". Not sure that racist name is still officially allowed though. 😅 That treat has a long history!
That’s a tea cake and it’s not cake I no it is a wired name but you just have to roll with it
It looks like a flødeboller 😊
You see that marshmallow chocolate thing.Yes so in Lebanon they are called Ras Al Abed,and they might be so sugary but they were perfect for us as kids we really enjoyed them.
Aw girl im sorry your disappointment was immeasurable and your day was ruined ):
Its probably what they call it where they’re from🤷🏾‍♀️
It's Called a "flødebolle" in Denmark. We mostly eat Them at birthdays.
We got something akin to those those here in the Netherlands, we call them kisses, nobody would call them cakes. Not quite filled with marshmallow though, more a fluffy cream.
Girl...it is still a cake. It is literally ' tea cake ' lol. It's just different usage in words. You might want to learn that not everything is gonna circle around your world lol
First world problems !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Lol 😂
Its similar to a tunnocks teacake, except that has a biscuit base rather than a waffle base. True though, when it's not what you expect, doesn't matter how good it is, it's just not what you want!!
You SCAMMERS I live for food!! HOW DARE U do THIS
Girl you need to be careful how you critique different types of food in other countries. Stay respectful and humble when you’re putting out contents like this.
I ligit live in Manchester but have never seen this stall
I think it was suppose to be a Tunnocks tea cakes, but yeah the ratio of base to marshmallow is WAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYY off
YOU GOT TROLLLEED😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
In Israel we call them krémbo (roll the r)
It’s called راس العبد its a Palestinian  Desserts
It honestly looks good because I love chocolate, cookie, and marshmallow combos. But if I were getting a cake I’d want a cake lol
Are u mad at moon pies because it isnt a “pie” 😒
This is very cheap ingredients labeled as luxury?
Why did udo that small business  owner like that?
That's what we call "Schaumküsse" in Germany. Delicious, but I can see how it's disappointing if you're expecting cake 😅
Here in England we call them a Tea Cake... even though it has no cake... or icing... look we are weird okay? It is a Tea Cake!
Manchester Christmas market was trash 😤
If anything this sadly proves that Americans are so distant from the rest of the world, a lot of European folk in the comments have their own names for this treat and likewise for my British brothers and sisters, we call them teacakes. It just seems like everywhere is connected and America is just... kinda there to the side. Join in I say. Call 'em what you want like we all have. I can also see why you'd be tricked though, at least you won't be tricked a 2nd time Lol.
FLØDEBOLLER!!!   I love these. 💘a very popular Danish treat. I am allergic now, but I do miss them so much.
Where I live they're called "Beso de Moza". I remember I liked them a lot when I was a kid; I bought entire boxes of them with my mom and there were ones with lucuma flavor too. Though, it has been years since I had one.   I live in Peru btw.
In Austria we call those „Schwedenbomben“, which actually means Swedish bombs. Former they were called „Negerküsse“, but that word is politically incorrect.
Tell me you're from America without telling you're from America 😑😑😑😑😑
You should go to the Trafford centre there are a lot of great shops
Here in Brazil this candy is called "teta de nega". It's very tasty and you can find it in bars and places that sell sweets. "Teta de Nega" is a candy made of meringue or marshmallow and chocolate icing, with a Waffle biscuit underneath. I love this candy ❤
I hate those!
Im my country it's called bomboca it's delicious!!
It would’ve been better if it was marshmallow fluff or wip cream tho…..
well u see that "cake you were eating is a "flødebolle"  which was made by the scots in 1800s but is very popular here in denmark and most  of the nordic country's
Those are teacakes.  And they look like really nice ones.
You know it’s bad when they have to give you the definition - which Manchester was this ? Like where in the world
Omgg i love those They are the best i cant stop eating Them and yes it Is a cake all cakes are diffrint
We have this in Iran too it’s called “Bastani Zemestooni” or Winter icecream!
I've only had one disappointing event involving chocolate. It was a chocolate rubarb pie, I'd never had rubarb so I gave it a try.....I hope the person got sugar and salt mixed up. Because otherwise that's the last I have rubarb!!🤢🤢🤢
They can also be known as tea cakes in England..
This was so funny to see since where I live this is an iconic sweet, often the thing kids give to their class on their birthday, I was so confused when you called it a cake, but then Idk what else to call it? I think most people in Europe knows this treat and therefore I think that was why no one really thought to much about the name at the shop? Idk I can see why it might be a confusion, but anyway
I feel like I've went to the same shop because I live there XD
We have this in Brazil as well and we all know it’s not a cake, just a tad of cultural difference there
FLØDEBOLLE
In South Africa these are called kisses they have different flavours but it could also be considered a tea cake based on the reactions of people in the comments It seems its common around the world but you dont get them in America so you didnt know what to expect
i was waiting for u to dunk the cake into the hot coffee...yummy😍
I was expecting it to be hollow af
it pooks good though,Europe fascinates me with their diverse foods 😄
So, essentially they are like gigantic pinwheels...
I like that!  Lol!  Surprise!!!
Our country has tousands of these “fake cakes” and is very popular. They taste amazing. Its sad that theres no Word for it in english.   I love Them tho its very sweet
Perfect ending.
Shut up
These are called teacakes. But everyone knows they’re not technically cakes idk why it’s called that
Lol that’s a tea cake.
In France, it's called '' tête de nègre'' but I funny know when they changed it to ''tête de crème''. I would really like French to stop doing the same thing to other racism expression, names that turn into common uses like''Mongol'', ''tête de turque'',''chinois cake''
IT BETTER BE A CAKE
Does are called ‘zoenen’ in the Netherlands 🇳🇱 that translates to kisses
Its original an Austrian sweet treat. Invented 1924 from Walter Niemetz and is called Schwedenbombe.  Since 1934 its a registered Trademark.
In Hungary, we call this Nigerian's kiss (sounds a biit racist). Its not a cake, its badly sugared whip cream under chocolate placed on a waffle. I hate those things.
here in Peru they are called "Besos de mosa" they are delicious :) ❤️
Postal
You should visit derby i’ve been their and they have great food! Especially fish and chips!
In fact this is not a cake it's a chocolate kiss or chocolate fluff!I don't know why they call it a cake!
It is a cake it’s in danish called Flødebolle
Ah, Americans.
I think those are tea cakes, the same name concept as shortbread, crab cakes and korean pancakes. That's why when you're traveling specially with a culture you're not fully knowledgeable of, the first thing you do is ask about the food item since it could contain stuff that you shouldnt eat because of dietary restrictions or simply ingredients you dislike. Even if your just traveling within your country, its safe to ask first than to regret later specially if its in your part that lacked and not the seller.
Kinda like a Phillapino AMERICAN 🤔. SAME DIFFERENCE
That’s a teacake!
These are popular in sweden there is a werry common brand called mums mums and no it is not pronounced moms moms. mums is a slang word for good or delicious my fav is from a brand  called lendia in the state Norrtälje
can you ask ‘what’s inside the cake?’ before purchasing? or is it meant to be a mystery?
It should at least have Ferrero tasting filling on the inside
🤍Jesus says: “Very truly I tell you, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will not be judged but has crossed over from death to life.‘’ So forgive others so that you may be forgiven, then repent of your sins, believe in Jesus as your Lord and Saviour, (He’s God manifested as a human) and trust ONLY in His sacrifice to be saved from hell.  John 3:5: “…Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.”  “I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the father except through me.”
Ras al abed y'all
THATS NOT A CAKE, AND ITS NOT MARSHMALLOW FLUFF! THATS A TEACAKE, AND ITS EGGWHITES AND SUGAR INSIDE, ITS A CLASSIC IN DENMARK!
Welp the portal game was right  (The cake is a lie)
Called a flødebolle in Denmark aka a creambun
What part of Manchester are/were you in?
I don’t see how anyone can be tricked by this lol it looks so much like a teacake, I can’t imagine it being anything else. Though, the waffle bottom is a bit weird/random
I’m so sorry for your experience 😂
That is a danish desert it is called flødebolle (flu-a-bul) i have it every time in Denmark when I go. It is weird that they called it a chocolate cake.
You really filmed this mans entire foodstand to call his products the most disappointing thing you ate. 😭 There are so many foods with names that don’t actually totally match the actual product.
I would ask whats in it first. (Proof cake is a lie!!!!)
Aww jeanelle... So adorable even being disappointed
You went Manchester why
As a dutch person I don't want to say what they used to be called over here 😬 if you know you know.  I LOVE them so much tho, so delicious 😌
In the uk we call anything with the  world cake just cake
Lol I knew it was gone be some bullshit it’s like the top half of a dipped ice cream cone 😂
I love them !!!
I know these as teacakes, that may be where the confusion came from.
It's a fancy Tunnocks Tea Cake, I've bought this at a Xmas Market and was disappointed more with the waffle bottom instead of chocolate covered biscuit. Try a tunnocks tea cake as the foam is the best bit 👌
Honey no one goes to the uk for the food
that's a beso de moza and it's better than a cake
TEACAKES!! We havent had one in so long 😭
In Iran it is called winter ice cream. We love it
In Poland in part where I live we call them „warm ice cream”. I don’t know if they are called like this everywhere in my country but they are very well known also in Germany.
What country will you find that in?
I think I have to block her channel from my views :( she’s gotten so judgmental. Loved you Jeanell, but your “content” has gotten out of hand
It’s very frustrating how you put down cultures sometimes.
I do enjoy her videos, but they always feel very “I’m better than you”
In South Africa we call it sweetie pies. Now evolved to sweetie kisses. These are childhood memories. Delicious
choco mallows! 😄
That's a 'Teacake', Tunnocks style. It's just a different kind of British cake/dessert. Your food videos are good but do some research on the places you're visiting and the foods instead of calling it a "lie" straight away lol.
So upsetting
I thought those were called dickmans. Used to eat them as a kid when I loved in Germany around Christmas. Never was a fan but why would they call it cake id be mad too lmao
Omg we have something very similar in South Africa called Sweetie Pies and they are they most wonderful and delicious thing ever ❤ As a kid, getting one was always **THE** ultimate treat. Let's face it, as an adult it still is.
Lol same when someone advertised new cereal trend but shows a fruit salad.
In Finland we call it "Suukko" and it's supposed to have marshmallow like cream inside with chocolate around and waffle under
No ma'am. U r right, I want cake! I would've put it in my coffee ☕
We have these in the Netherlands as well. The worst is that they would call these types the n*****kiss. Luckily, since couple of years they changed name to just kiss. I never liked them. I prefer a real cake
these are fucking great, i grew up with these and they're awesome 🖤
You must be new here…haven’t you heard about any of the gazillion things British people call cake that is not cake?
Omg, that looks so delicious. I LOVE marshmallow. Especially marshmallow fluff.
Hahahah I just had one for the first time las week and was totally caught off guard too lol!!! I did enjoy it, but didn’t expect what was inside.
In Israel We call it crambo
Perhaps, since you're not in the usa and not everything is called the same in different countries regardless of whether they share a language, you should start asking for clarification when buying food, so as to avoid this kind of disappointments? Just a thought...
It's a tea cake so it's a cake 🤣🤣🤣 xx
dont be dissapointed chocolate kisses are rly famous and they are actually pretty good next time dont try new things so you wont be dissapointed :)
Manchester 💪
In Germany they're called chocolate kisses (slightly less racist than the original name but not great), chunky man (because of the one main brand that does them) or foam kisses
In germany we actually call them Chocolate-Kiss xD
Omfg I got these for the first time the other day, not in Manchester but somewhere else in England and I'd never heard of them until then
In Danmark its name is flødebolle.🤤
just cause of that your whole day is already ruined??? smh 🙄🙄🙄
We called it flødeboller, cream buns, it is a thin waffel, whit a cream/marsmellow fluff, and it is dipped in chokolate 🙈
It’s a huge thing a Germany, you can translate it to „Chocolate Kisses“. But they’re not really a Christmas thing, we eat them the year round, often for birthdays, but not as a cake, more like some treats on the side. Greetings from rainy Germany!😊
Well it is a cake XD in center Europe it's most popular name is hot ice-cream. It's a cream(having marshmallow-like structure) made of mostly sugar and whites depending on a country. And then a waffle is a cake XD so you know
Cake?😂
I have tried all the flavours
You just hurt every Swiss person at once
Was this an intentional Portal reference? 😂
FLØDEBOLLER 🇩🇰
I knew what it was immediately. 😂
they’re called teacakes in the uk
This is so ignorant and insulting. Cake has different meanings in different parts of the world, just like pudding, biscuits, chips etc do.
The think she got is a arab desert it is marshmallow filling and biscuit in the bottom
👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽
👎🏽👎🏽
👎🏽
Why you bashing this poor guys business ? Just because you didn’t get a cake? Silly girl 👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽
It looked so GOOD
I think you mean teacakes?
It’s a tea cake in the UK !!
In England these are teacakes. We also have a raisin bread also called teacake. It's real confusing and frustrating when you want one and get the other
Lie vs. Ignorance  ... ... ... ... ... ... ...  Now, before anyone reacts violently 🤪 , I'd like to clarify that I don't mean any offense. ✌ However, I did purposely choose a word that I thought could be offensive (ignorance) just to show that the word used in the title (lie) could be offensive. I mean, just imagine if you are the stall owner or the chef making those, and a customer said your product was a lie! When in fact, the customer was just not familiar with it and expected something else...   As someone said in the comments and replies, not all "cakes" are "cakes" (fish cakes and crab cakes were mentioned), and different people from different places and cultures call things differently.  So perhaps a little more care in the words you choose, please? "This cake is not what I expected" sounds better to me than "this cake is a lie".  Unless you really wanted to be clickbaity... 😐  Btw, I believe you are Filipino so I expect you may be familiar with Brazo de Mercedes? That is considered a cake, right? Because this video made me google "is brazo de mercedes a cake". 🤣 And the results do describe it as a type of rolled cake, but the ingredients in the recipe I found did not contain any flour either.   Anyway, just want to say again, I don't mean any offense.  Have a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!
*hysterically laughs in European*
Its a flødebolle. I love them
In Perú they are called "Besos de Moza", which translates as "Chocolate Kisses" as well. They are such a simple but tasty treat, I love them!
That is the same as a Danish "flødebolle" (creampuff)
I feel your pain 🤣🥲
This looks like brazilian "nhá benta", if you buy the generic version you'll pay less than 1¢ each. THIS IS REALLY GOOOOOD
Aren't they "snowballs"? Cakes usually aren't coated in hard chocolate, how could you not see that?
Was a couple of years since my last one. Now I want one, and I don't even particularly like them!  But they remind me of summer, funfairs and crowded stalls where you can find a lot of things you've both looked for and also things you didn't know existed.
My disappointment is measurable and my day is ruined. -Report Of The Week 🔥
Wow that is actually really rude ngl
They still look good, and I'm not a big marshmallow fan either. The man looks like he puts a lot of effort into his little stand.
Omg that looks delish!!!
In France, they used to be called "Tête de nègre" (nigg**'s head). Brazil, calls/called(?) it the same.   Well, for obvious reasons, the French eventually changed the name to "Tête au chocolat" (chocolate heads), 😅.
U better sue them lol
In Israel it's actually called "Krembo" and it actually comes in vanilla or mocha fluff flavor- it is a mixture of egg whites with hard chocolate exterior and waffle bottom, and it's extremely popular in the winter.
Not anything thats has a name cake in it was a cake, that's why there's country's diff cultures, Lesson learned 👍🏻✨
That can be their version of a cake. I would research what it means to them vs the American definition
Hi in the UK we call them tea cakes, in super markets you can get tunnocks teacakes which are mini versions of these so that is probably where the confusion is. To make it more confusing we have a bread-like cake with raisons that you toast and they are also called teacakes 😂
First of all, this is not a cake, and, it is delicious
these are called teacakes in england, not sure why bc they’re clearly not cakes but we also call bread t-cakes so who knows
He'll am I the only one who find this irritating considering the absolute tut you get fed in America? Cheek!
It's a tea cake lool
We call them sweetie pies in South Africa
I call it a teacakes there really popular where I come from
It is a sweetie pie. It is loved in South Africa.
Oh man I'd be so disappointed, and I hate marshmallow fluff 😤
We call it “warm ice cream” in Poland
Every place has its own definition of cake..
It's a tea cake
In my country its called warm icecream/hot icecream and ive never seen it without waffle
It’s a tea cake
I had that once in Cambridge, Cambridgeshire I knew they look like marshmallow they were filled chocolate marshmallow
Looks like a version of a tea cake.
thanks for bashing on a cultural Brazilian treat....
oh I know that, it was a super common treat for kids in the 70's here in Brazil, I live in the south so there's not much of it here since it's more predominant on the north part of the country, but it's really good
Makes me think of ice cream cake. Don't get me wrong, I like ice cream cake. Just wish it had cake in it instead of the just "crunchy bites" they say is cake.
I hate marshmallow. I’d be livid
Beso de moza jsjfjd
OMG I live where you are
🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩I don't like marshmallow
Holy moly!  I was so mad for you!!!
Are you kidding me your day is ruined over a cake hole boy do you have a lot of life ahead of you girl sorry but if that’s as tough as your day was I don’t wanna hear it
We have this in Brazil, It's called teta de nega, black woman tit ( yes, I know, very racist). I was shocked to see something I used to eat as a child.
Chocolate teacake
I’m jamming to Usher’s “You don’t have to call” playing ever so softly in the background
Negative. .... Just enjoy yaself. Cake looked lovely
In Portugal we call it Bomboca. Nhammm
You are in the UK. Cake us not so literal. Cake is anything sweet or Cake, padtry, sponge' pie.
in israel its called "krembo" which means "has cream in it"  used to eat it as a child but now its disgusting to me for some reason  (also we dont have any other versions beside a mocha one and a regular milk chocolate version. we really dont have a variety)
It's called a teacake
That’s definitely not a cake, knew what it was right away cause of the shape
It's a teacake haha
We Dutch people have some strange namings for things. Though this one is changed a few years ago, for good reasons. It's called a "Choco kiss". It's like the Milka Mellow cakes
100k LIKER
In Denmark we Call this “flødebolle” which is cream bun and many people share Them with their class on their birthday in School. Everybody knows it
Americans............
They are called teacakes and are a british food they are traditionally made from a thin wafer or biscuit(cookies as you call them in america)  with jam and marshmallow coated in chocolate it is in fact a form of cake
It's a tea cake so yes it's correct
In israel its called crembo
Its very common is israel
Like a british tea cake which i think they went for
What r those no thanks
This is a 1.99 Brazilian sweet that you give to the people you don't really like   It is disappointment wrapped in cheap chocolate
It is called krembo, it’s really good tho
In Denmark that is called flødeboller, which means '(whipped) cream buns'. That the filling is made of... Cream!!.
Sadly this vlogger didnt quite understand much about it. Hahaha. Funny but it makes her stupid with her DISAPPOINTMENT.
Why do people all the time😭😭😭😭😭😭
Your actually really rude and discriminatory  Stop complaining when there are people starving it just seems ungrateful
I don’t know why they describe it as a cake. But that’s a Swedish dish my favorite dessert as a child. I’d be in heaven with that shop. It’s gourmet marshmallow 😋
It looks like choco pie to me and i love choco pie! I'd dip that in my hot choco 😋   P.S. It wouldn't hurt to ask what it is made of tho before you try huhu
Nope. I want cake not fluff.
It's a teacake. Not the came as cake.
It's a teacake
I like this but this is not a cake, we have it in Hungary but the name is very offensive so im not going to write it down
YOU WERE IN MANCHESTER?!?! 😭😭😭
ferrero roche
You need to eat it in Belgium we call it “negerine tetten” all ducht people are dying of laughter
I LOVE these. I sometimes buy a box full (they're smaller) from Lidl. The shape is very recognizable and can't be mistaken for cake (for us)
I would have expected a cake too if it said cake on the display! Or at least half cake and half marshmallow not a cookie or waffle with marshmallow on top.
Reminds me of a cookie my grandmother used to buy called a marshmallow pinwheel. It was a cookie with a swirled marshmallow looking thing on top and then dipped in chocolate.
miscommunication te. wag mo siraan yung stall
Man... You really chose Manchester for a place to go on holiday... I feel for you
This is definitely not a cake 😅 Like many others have said it is called a cream bun in danish and apparently (according to google) was invented in Denmark in the 1800s :)
I would be kind of bummed about it to 🙂
In Brazil we have a bunch of theses, and the name depends on the brand, but it's usually called "chocolate covered marshmallows" or "chocolate covered wafers with marshmallow", personally I prefer the one without the wafer (first one), and the marshmallow can be flavored, like coconut or passion fruit. I just eat the regular and I LOVE this, I hate the hard marshmallows, but the soft, like fluff or meringue, with chocolate is one of my favorite type of chocolates. If I'm going to a chocolate shop (really common stores in the region I live), I'm always buying that for me, but never seen it called a "cake"
Americans🙄
This called a sweetie pie in South Africa. Tunnocks make similar called a teacake, but with a biscuit type base not a waffle. And Mancunians call it a LUXURY CAKE..... 🙄😂
Technically it is a cane
Lol I just watched someone’s christmas market vlog and seen those in the background and thought I bet those are so good
It is called gräddbulle in Swedish and no it is not a cake. I love them dipped in chocolat an ripped coconut
I LOVE these marshmallow things, they are amazing. I went to both Manchester and Liverpool christmas markets at the weekend
dont just gp around travel and get disappointed on some foods made and named by the Local. YOU DISAPPOINT ME like this, soooo judgemental on you
In Finland, these are called 'suukko', which means kiss. Personally, not a huge fan of the filling, the waffle is the best part haha. Though there are multiple flavors, like strawberry and I think mocha is also one.
I took one look and knew it was a fat marshmallow
In the netherlands, they’re called chocozoenen (chocolate kisses) and they’re really good!  To most europeans, these are an iconic childhood snack, but they shouldn’t have been advertised as cakes, as that is confusing for tourists!
It's a mellocake in Belgium
Its a teacake  Which is neither tea, nor cake.  But definitely delicious!!
:0 I’m from Manchester
Dickmann in germany :)
I SAW U THERE
Looks like a waffel Chocolate Mallow Biscuit
omg you’re in manchester!
I- I thought everyone knew those? They’re not quite my thing bc they’re so sweet but they’re quite common here
In england, thats called a tea cake. it normally has a waffle at the bottom and a mollowy filling. its called a tea cake because u eat it with ur tea
thats a zoen, aka a kiss, in the netherlands!
I would have taken that ish back and asked for something else that was ACTUALLY a cake 😭🤣
Its actually really popular in russia, its called 'zifir' which is basically egg whites mixed with pectin and some sugar and often covered in chocolate.
looks delicious though 😋😍
That's called a sweetie pie😂
This thing looks like it needs some kind of extra flavoring inside the center of it besides just the whipped cream cuz that would make this thing good. Still don't like being deceived into thinking you were getting cake bites though regardless of how good the food is.
I thought lie stuffs like this only exists in Asian markets lol
Im german and i think it was called dickman like fatman
That is a lie.  Mislabels. But the treat does look interesting.
Its called flødebolle in Denmark, theyre rly good tho
When they said "cake" they might've meant like a chocolate tea cake, that looks like a fancy Tunnoks tea cake to me :o The wording can get confusing sometimes.
In Brazil this is called "teta de nega" and is exactly how you described. I was disappointed too when I ate it for the first time even knowing that it was just a waffle with marshmallow on top dipped in chocolate :'D
I think I tried that before. It tasted not good but not bad either
That's not a cake I agree
In my country people call it winter ice cream....
Why? Just why those look nasty that>cake=better
in Brazil those are usually called Nhá Benta, I really like them but would also be extremely disappointed if someone sold it to me as cake, because it's not even close lol
You are not ready 😂
so its like a tunnocks tea cake then?
In Brasil we call it Dantop  🖤 it used to have another name but it was super disrespectful so we changed it to the brand’s name that sells them
In french it's called a "tête de choco" which means choco head. It used to have a different name... but it was REALLY racist
This literally isn't cake lol, idk, I'm all the way in Brazil and I've seen these multiple times. There's no way I'd mistake it for cake.
It's a snowcake
It's called a mums mums in Sweden means yummy yummy
That's a "Nhá Benta" in Brazil
It's called Nhá-Benta in Brazil. I looove it.
NO SWEARInG
I don't care if it's a cake or not but I think I'll like it. LOL!
Mums mums (yum yum?) is what we call them in Sweden, kove them 😃
In Denmark people always seem to give them out in schools for whatever reason they can find. It's someone's birthday? They're probably bringing these for the class, teacher is late? Better bring some of these
It’s not exactly a lie though… in England we have tea cakes which many in the UK would just call cakes.
C'est une pâtisserie très connue en France. Ça s'appelle une Tête au Chocolat. Autrefois, ça s'appelait "Tête de Nègre", mais le nom a changé parce que c'était inapproprié (à cause du mot Nègre).  C'est du blanc d'œuf sucré battu en neige, posé sur une gaufrette, et enrobé de chocolat. On en trouve aussi dans tous les pays francophones (Canada, Belgique...), et dans toute l'Europe. Je suis étonnée, je pensais que cela était connu aux États-Unis...
In my country it's called chocolate princ and i love it! It's soft and fluffy and sort of a childhood dessert for me😂
It’s not a lie
Was that an unintentional Portals reference?
Idk about everyone else, but these are honestly so great when you slice the end, eat the biscuit part and then let the cream bob in your hot chocolate, my favorite thing to do every christmas :)
We call those "beijocas" in the part of Portugal I'm from
It's called a Tea Cake in the UK
Flødebolle in Denmark. They are the best!
I already knew from the start what this was from the beginning. Germany has this kind of sweet, I think in every Supermarket. It's called Thick Men (Dick Männer) or Chocolate Kiss.
I know this as "teta de moça" (lady's tit) kjkmkm
“The Cake Is A Lie” Me:*Portal flashbacks*
Just a giant tea cake to us brits 🤣
This is called teta de nega in brazil
They called tea cake
Always research words with different meanings in other countries 🤣 Just assume what you're getting is different than what you think it will be and you'll enjoy it regardless. Haha. I grew up in England and loads of words have double meanings. Like if you get a Yorkshire pudding, it's a type of"bread." And if someone asks if you want to have pudding after dinner, they just mean dessert, not actual pudding. Etc etc
Its a german thing...
I love those but they are not a cake more of a desert
Why do i feel like that the marshmallow  would be better then cake inside of it
It’s a teacake what do u mean!? It has it in its nameeeee!
Ew I fucking hate those
In my country this used to be called a negro's Kiss. Rebranded to foam Kiss recently for obvious reasons... I just made a batch coincidentally
I visited Iran and they call this بستنی زمستانی (winter's ice cream)
its a tea cake
in my country we caml them….cream balls idk if that would sell as good to tourists as chocolate cake😅
I noticed in French bakery they do not bake anymore. They just sell every sort of cake in mousse form. Chocolat mousse, strawberry mousse, vanilla mousse… no cakes, no pastries anymore it makes me furious…
In Polish people refer to this as "ciepłe lody" which in English literally means "hot ice cream". I my opinion it's way to sweet and disgusting, but you guys can give it a try while given a chance 😊
It's a Tea Cake XD
It's called a cake bc it's meant to be a tea cake the original ones are so much better I live in Manchester but I'm Portuguese
This reminds me of popular treats in the Philippines a "Choco Mallows" it's a lot smaller and the bottom part is biscuit.
I live in germany. At our school we could get these things between a bread role (brötchen).
I think most filipino's hate marshmallow fluff
Omg I got the same thing and had the exact same thought as well 😂😂 like honestly didn't know it was just like a Marshmello fluff inside
It’s a tea cake
Looks similar to some "tea cakes"
well everyone who is not a German is confused and every German knows the chocolate kisses. I have no idea why there is cake, it really isn't.
It still looks good tho
In Israel it’s Krembo. Uh. I hate it but everybody loves it. They sell it only on autumn so when it comes around everybody wants to get one
Ur not in America.. U don't know their culture LOL. They r beautiful and their ppl like it.... Just not u
No cale at all did u ask if it was cake
in denmark we call this "flødeboller" often when someone is turning a year they give their classmates these
In South Africa we call them Sweetie Pies, everyone knows the look of it.
The level of unappreciative in this brief video makes me sad. Idc how much you spent on this desert good or bad. You were still able to eat it. Throw the couple away 🤦🏻‍♀️
As soon as I saw this is knew it was flødeboller  which is a Danish treat that has marcipan on the bottom and marshmallow fluff on top covered in chocolate and sometimes coconut, it is usually enjoyed on ice cream but bigger ones can be enjoyed alone. In Denmark even generic not cakes things are described as a cake. Like my grandparents will come home and say we bought a type of cake and it’s actually an apple tarlet or a lemon pie. I hope that clears it up. Also in England they are Called tea cakes so that’s another thing
In Brazil, we called it "teta de nega". That is definitely not a cake
Its a luxuries mallowpuff!!!!!!! ITS MEANT TO BE LIKE THAT
Americans expecting other countries to be carbon copies of the US again huh? 😂
In uruguay you can buy a treat called ricardito and it is the same thing. My grandpa used to bring them for me when he came back to Canada. But yeah, ain't a cake
In Scotland and England we call it a tea cake
This is called راس العبد in jordan
Yeah us English call that a tea cake 😂
A mina nunca ouviu falar de teta de nega
Me hate marshmallows. Aye🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️
Looks so good!
We call it a bon bon l am from France bonjour 👋
this is the perfect example of a first world problem
Its called a flødebolle in Denmark litterally translates to heavycream bun, but that was really misleading, but its the first time i Think about that not all countryens have these in their country  Edit: i know the last part sounds dumb
I love those but I think theyre hard to eat lol
Yeah its not a cake my mom is from manila and she was surprised aswell. We live in germany and that is normal here they are pretty delicious
I must recommend going to a place called Home in Manchester it is amazing and I feels like home!😂✋🏼❤️
That is not a cake
Probably a lot of us might like it but there was NO NEED to lie to customers
Oh we call it 'winter ice cream' in Iran cuz... well it's kind of like ice cream but melted and warm-
It's a chocolate kiss
These are vile i bought some years ago as gifts and the ones i got had some some of alcohol in them that wasnt advertised and they were like eating a heavily perfumed styrofoam 🤣
Omg that is so good they sell them in Israel only in winter because they melt in the summer but they are called Crembo
These are teacakes! 😂
I saw those today and wanted to get one, glad I didn’t !
These are called tea cakes where I’m from.
By all means come to different countries and try new things but please do not get upset because we call things different names if you walked into a pub and ordered a cider don’t expect apple juice it’s going to be alcoholic this is the same in England that is called a tea cake although admittedly it is quite confusing as a teacake can also be a sort of sweet bread bun with raisins toasted and buttered served with your tea or coffee in a cafe
we have them here in czech republic too, i think a lot of europeans wouldn’t mistake them for actual cake😭
I ahve them at home
In Poland we call these "warm ice cream" idk why :D
In Jordan we call it "Rasel Abed"
Thats a munchmallow cake in Europe :)
Is this Manchester is england
Where this at ?
In Italy it's called "spumini" (or at least in my part)
I love this thing, but you are right, it is more of a dessert or chocolate treat than cake... But to be honest it is hard to name the thing properly. In its national language it is called "cream ball" despite not containing cream. In my country we call it "warm ice cream" despite it not being ice cream of course.
it’s called a ciepły lód (warm ice cream) here in poland so nobody really thinks of it as cake 😅🤗
My city ❤️
Here in Bangladesh, we have a huge variety of sweets named "Pitha". Some are sweet while some have spicy side dishes to dunk the "pitha" in. And they are made of rice flour(varieties require Various processes). The translation of "pitha" in English is Cake. They are very popular during the winter. So i guess the definition of a cake can be different in various countries/cultures.
It's a tea cake! Misleading name for sure.. but out of the ones I've had, that one looks pretty damn good
Bro i love those and where i live we call them fløde boller witch translates to cream buns
We call that winter ice-cream in Iran. I love it
it’s a tea cake !
i call it a 'zoen' aka a kiss
Where does it say they're cakes?
Those are like mallomars.
In Lebanon we call these Tarboush and it comes in 3 flavors. It’s a chocolate delicacy only found during winter because it melts in the Summer
pls... here in france, the name was racist for a long time. it was "tête de n*****" (the n-word) which means "n******'s head" then they changed it a few years ago, now the name is "tête au choco" which means "choco's head".
In England we call it a teacake and they’re very iconic around Europe
its not on purpose i promise, people from Ireland and the UK tend to refer to all treats as cakes, so if you're looking for actual cake make sure theres no S at the end :) cake and cakes are different here
You need to realize that people in Britain don't speak English, it's H.P. Lovecraft world where everything is designed to make you insane.
I love those
That's a fancy tunnocks tea cake. I love it more than I should.
It's called crembo and i think that it's an Israeli "snack"
Its a cream cake. Or as we call it "fløde kage" it comes with many flavours today. But some counties wich have adepted this sweet call it "winter icecream"  And actually its very delicious and fits in most occasiond. By the way im from Denmark
Yeah lol
Hehe those are bon bons
In Poland we call it "ciepłe lody" and it means "warm ice-cream" (don't know why but-). It was really popular in my kindergarden lmao
I also really don’t like the marshmallow chocolate combo. At least not like that. I like minis in hot cocoa and marshmallows in s’mores. But when it’s just a marshmallow inside hard chocolate, nope
Omg these are sooooo gooooodddddd
I've been living in Peru for almost 5 years and they call those Beso De Mosa. They're actually really good, they're shaped exactly like that and taste like s'mores
Is that swiss meringue, maybe?
Just had Starbucks cake pop for the first time the other day and it was a sugar cookie dough 😅 I feel you, it was alright
this is not a cake this is chocolate with marshmallow filling, its called ras el-abd in Jordan, and it is very well-known, so it's not a scam and it is well-known in other places, like Germany.
In Bolivia we call it black kiss
:l i feel bad for you
Lol - that's like a dickmanns 😂
Eh... Americans
Tea cakes are marshmallow fluff with a waffer on the bottom with a chocolate outside you have it with a cup of tea usually thays how we have them in engalnd . xx
i would have been mad too girl
Don't forget cake in the US is different than what is in England they might call it a sponge or pudding. but also cake can be a small thick disk of baked/fried/grilled bread that may not be sweet.
Lmao we call this „Mohrenkopf“ in Switzerland. That’s not cake😂
In Germany is it called Schocko Kuss (chocolate kiss) 🤭😅❤️
My day is ruined-The Report of the Week, lmao… great reference.
Stop complaining lady, everyone from Europe knows what a chocolate kiss is and what is inside. And the ones that are handmade ARE luxurious. How arrogant do you have to be to go to a country and complain that food you don't know turns out to be different than you expected it to be?!
It’s a tea cake??!!
It’s funny because I would really like that
Love the name of it. In Germany many people call this a "n*gga kiss"...
That’s a tea cake 😅😅 not actually a cake 😅
Thats just our version of chocolate kisses in europe! I love to eat a whole box of them and feel disgusting the entire day after. Also, in my opinion the best way to eat them is to stuff a whole one in your mouth instead of taking bites
That is a Krembo.
Isn't that considered false advertising then? I understand that you can have marshmallow cakes but it would still have a sweet breading in it.
So in my country it's called something like "warm ice cream" even if it's not ice cream lol
They are called "warm ice cream" in my country 😄
They were in the markets since I was a kid ( I'm from Poland, east Europe) and I immediately recognized them, but I've never saw them on Christmas!
These are called Krembos here in israel although Krembo is made by a specific brand so that looks almost like a knock off
I love how many people from different countries are saying their names for this "cake" :D  May I join? In Poland we call them warm-ice cream for some reason :)
We have those in Finland, and they are so good! Their name is "Suukko"  Which means kiss:)
Those marshmallows in the UK are called "tea cakes." It IS a cake🙏💜(Dear - you know, you could always stay in the US - & go on  a tractor pull, etc) Peace🙏💜
We call them bombocas in Portugal and they can be amazing
That would have upset me
We have those in lebanon, they come wrapped in yellow foil it used to be every kid's favourite treat until now, no one can afford treats anymore 😅
It's a tea cake. A chocolate tea cake. Kids birthday party staple over here
its flødebolle in denmark, its awesome, it may not be cake. But its really good as a small treat for sharing around on ur birthdays in ur class :))) (thats mostly what we use them for) I dont think ive met anyone who went down to the supermarket and then bought "flødeboller" without them having to share them at school tbh.
uhm have u guys nevr tasted those 😱 …omg in denmark we eat it all the time and also for birthdays 🥳
Oof the loop got me lol
Flødeboller! Definitely not cakes but delicious nonetheless - the coconut ones are my favorite
I mean, most people from Europe will know what it is and that's why it's advertised as a cake... So... Do your research kids
This is called "tarboush" in my country
Here in Denmark we call it flødeboller and is ofte eaten at bithdays
Uts a crambo its from israel
it’s actually a cake! snack actually but yes
in brazil we call it "teta de nega" (black tit) lol
This is called Nhá Benta here in Brazil. It’s so good!!!
In south africa we call that a sweetie pie and is often given to your love on valentine
In my country it's really popular and it's delicious
This is classified as a teacake. Its not really a cake but it's amazing in London
So agree
Only Americans would be fooled by that lol
In sweden we call them mums-mums and they're sooo good. You can tell that it's them by the shape and I think most europeans would know what it was lol
No thats a chocolate kiss 😂
Hey um those are teacakes! You might be familiar with tunnocks tea cakes, those are just like huge versions of those.
I mean I get you thought it was cake, and i would be a bit confused if I would be in that situation,  but like you dont have to describe it as '' The worst thing you ate in the trip. '' because its just..... a tea cake and I'm pretty sure it tasted good,  BY THE WAY this is not a hate comment, I dont mean to be rude.
We call them sweetie pies and they are yum!
I love those!
That is a teacake. It is “a cake” in name, but not definition
If I’m not wrong, this candy is one that is very good if you let some hours in the fridge, it gets another texture
This is a “skumtopp” or “mums mums” in Swedish. It’s delicious 🤤 but yeah, totally not a cake.
In poland we call it warm ice cream
This is tarbouch
It’s a snowball!!
Technically it is a cake lol
Its a teacake. Cookie like base an marshmallow fluff on the inside and covered in chocolate
This is actually an Arab cake it is made out March mail love chocolate and a waffle pretzel thing on the bottom.
Issa marshmallow! We have it in the Netherlands as well and its soo good
In Perú we call it beso de moza which translates to kiss from a girl, idk i think it’s cute
We called it crambow 😂🤌
In Germany it’s called chocolate Kiss it’s not really a cake
That’s a tea cake luv
Honestly I’d be disappointed too Lolol
FLØDBOLLER! This is an very common treat in Denmark.
In denmark we call them "flødebolle", basically translates to cream bun... It is not a cake lol
I’m from Manchester! I love the markets
It is called Depke
Ok I never knew them as a christmas treat. Here in Germany we eat them all over the year. But I think the company on the christmas market might actually be german since the name. But the name "chocolate cakes" is very misleading 🤨
Here in South Africa 🇿🇦 we call it a sweety pie
Jesus christ how american can you be?
Actually. It is a 'tranditional' polish, cheap to make pastry. It’s called 'ciepłe lody'-'warm ice cream' It was invented during the times of PRL, communism in Poland
Isn't it a hot ice cream we have them in Poland and they are really good
In the Netherlands they’re called ‘zoenen’. But that’s the changed name, because a few years ago they were called ‘n-word zoenen’ but then the n-word in Dutch. They changed it to just ‘zoenen’ bc it was racist
We have something similar here in South Africa called Sweetie pies, but they are commercially produced
Yeah… I would have been disappointed too lol
Oxe, a muie nao gosta de top bel, credo
there not cakesssss they are teacakes they didn't lie you just didn't know
I hope yall got the fudge from the christmas market, its literally irresistable at the manchester market too
Ah, chocolate kiss, I remember eating these when I was a kid and feeling sick because I ate too many of them lol
Those are like the tea cakes in a box in the supermarket at England but we have a biscuit at the bottom not a waffle.
Those are called chocolate kisses I like them theyre good.
Omg this such a big thing in England you can get it at the German Market which only happens round christmas
In Poland we call it “warm ice cream” or “hot ice cream”
It's a teacake. They're the actual best
Its a tea cake
I live in Germany and those usually get sold in supermarkets pretty often so for me it's not rare seing them
In Denmark it’s called a fødebolle (creambun) - and are usually a birthday thing
teacakes are amazing, but I also never understood why it was called a cake when all the different versions/brands I've had as had a biscuit base and where varied in sizes
I ate a box of these like a week ago, they came in just chocolate. In my country they're called chocolate kisses XD i don't know why but they've been in my life since my childhood. I've eaten a lot of these. I don't get them often but you can get them in any time of year in a lot of stores.
I thought there would be ice cream inside
Oooh those are called "flødeboller" in Danish, which means "whipped cream buns". They are an all around yearly treat but mostly something you buy for children parties. Last 10 years tho a lot of "luxury" versions of them have been popping up, mostly with liquorice pieces put into the glaze. (we love our liquorice here) But yeah, this was never a cake
In Denmark this is called a “cream bun”, it’s a little waffle biscuit with a meringue like filling it’s just not baked (sometimes it’s made with whipped cream) dipped in chocolate, we love handing them out it class if it’s someone’s birthday
I love those things here in Europe. I never thought Americans would look at that and expect cake. I buy them at Lidl and eat the whole box
We call them tea cakes usually in the UK it's really nice but not super satisfying 😂
Nah its a cake, that cake is not a lie bruh. Cake is not just bread wit cream etc,
omg i'm Hungarian, we call these "néger csók" (it's not the n word, don't get mad) which translates to black kiss. it's freaking delicious
Jeez whiny
Throw it in the chocolate
A nice way to create bad reputation for a business you don’t understand due to cultural differences.😬 Was the cake good?  Was the service good? Was the price good?  Sheesh.
I would have loved it but I totally agree when you have your mouth set on something and it turns out to be something else. It is soooooo DISAPPOINTING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!😥😥😥😥
Its popular here in romania and other slav east europe cauntries  We do call them cakes so sorry if u got catfished by a treat XD
That's a freaking beso de moza.  I was today years old when I found out beso de moza is not a dessert sold just in Perú, where is huge.
Imagine using these in hot chocolates tho..
Here in Brazil this is called "nhá benta"
Here in the Netherlands it's called a mega kiss. IDK WHY THEY CALLED IT A CAKE THO- this is just evil.
I would cry
In Denmark we call them flødebolle translated directly it would say fløde = "whipped cream" bolle="buns" and they're great tho I could imagine it'd be confusing to bite into if you expected a cake😅😄
in Ireland we call it a teacake
Aren’t they filled with like white stuff We call em chocolate kisses
It's a bon bon!!
qué dices de los besos de moza oe pq le faltas al respeto al dios
these are called ‘besos de moza’ in Perú, they’re everyone’s childhood here lol
They really took “The cake is a lie” to another level
You should've asked the vendor.
no its no cake its from swedan kokosballe  it is fluff
Over in israel they’re caller crembo, just usually have a cookie on the bottom, their pretty good but depends on what you like
Knew what it was when I saw it lol Grew up with them in Germany. But definitely never heard them being described as cake!
It made me way too happy that you quoted report of the week, and it made me even happier that you credited him loll
Im from the Netherlands and i went "oh no!" the moment i heard you calling them cakes XD also watch out with eating too much of them some people can get quite nauseous from them
I was in Manchester last week and almost got a cake from that stall, I hate marshmallow fluff so glad I didn't 😬
I could immediately tell what they were. We call them chocolate kiss in germany. (Some call them foam kiss). Do you not have that stuff in America??
Fun to see an Asian confused about European food for a change. 😂
Des is a „Schwedenbombe“ period
WHEN WAS THIS IM I LIVE IN MANCHESTER IS IT IN PICIDALLY GARDEN
I HAD THEM I liked it honestly and as soon as I saw them I said to the ppl with me they are marshmallow like I knew immediately
Yeah tea cakes r like that lol
In Portugal we call them "bombocas"
I would also have expected actual cake and been so disappointed lol
this would be considered a bombom in Brazil
In my country we call it "bomboca" its so good haha
We call them snowballs in Australia :) without the waffle at the bottom.
In Norwegian it is called kokkosbolle. Instead of crumbs on The outside there is coconut things, and a cream, marshmallow filling  Kokos = coconut  Bolle = bun  Cocosbun
I’ve never seen these be called cakes, but they are delicious. They’re common in many places in Europe 🙂
Dude. Does that look like a cake to you.
It is called "maria mole" in Brazil, is like a fluffy marshmallow covered in chocolate
here in IRAN we call them winter ice cream and they're popular as hell😊
It's really common here in Brazil. In here we freeze before eating, and its delicious!
Really isn’t the end of the world…
I was born in Manchester
As soon as I saw those things I knew what they were. Not cake, but I fucking love those things
Cultures defer. You are in the UK. That's meringue in the middle. Travelling is educational. You learned something new.
There's a nice little Spanish bar in Manchester called Sandinista. I used to go there with my mum every Saturday. They always play great music and the tapas is really good. Nice cocktails too
reading the definition of cake is the most passive aggressive thing ever and I'm 100% here for it
I knew what it's gonna be just by looking at it
Most people in Europe can tell what it is by it’s iconic look so I doubt anyone on the daily get tricked into thinking it’s cake lmao. Although I can see how it could be mistaken by tourists
everyone has cute names for these, meanwhile in my country they were called n-word heads 💀💀 edit: then the name was changed to black heads but that wasn't much better so now they're called chocolate heads 💀
It's a teacake in UK. It's not a cake in America. This is a common treat in UK, Germany, Poland, other European country, and Russia. In America, it's called Mallows.
that’s not a cake and I would have been sad too, marshmallow is gross unless burnt to a crisp
🙄 cake is simple soft and sweet bread in simple word
I love to eat those things in a bun. I’m from Germany and it’s called Schokokuss
We call those wintery ice creams
This is a very common dessert in europe! In Finland we call them "suklaa pusuja" which translates to chocolate kisses. They can have different flavored insides, my fvaorite is the strawberry one.
Un Ricardito jeje
It's a tea cake* as Brits would call it :)
Its a cookie
That's called "nhá benta" or "teta de nega" in Brazil, it's marshmallow or merengue with thin chocolate
So lots of people from the UK are saying it's a tea cake, which is true! The Scottish name for them is 'mallow' though, at least in my part of the central belt ☺️
✨ It better be a freaking cake ✨ lol the way your voice modulated there. 😂😂😂
😂😂😂 ya I live there and those are NOT cake but tbh it kind of tastes good
Here in Brasil this calls TopBel's or Dantop, is a very popular Candy you can buy on every Supermarket
It's called a tea cake it designed to melt in you hot coco/hot drink or that's what it is In most.places in Britain but if Ur not from here it can be a bit confusing it's also usually with a biscuit base not a waffle
There pretty yummy but its indeed not a cake But like it was the fault of the seller like why call it a cake?
Interesting… never thought of asking if it is a breaded cake when I am buying a “cake”…
My aunt who lives south always used to bring me these things called ‘sweetie pies’ that were exactly like this,came in red foil wrapping.
Those are very popular in Germany, when ever my Great Aunt comes over she ALWAYS brings those things, we love them to death.
Omg this is what we in Danmark call "flødeboller" translated means cream balls. We eat Them all the time
We call it winter icecream
In Iran we call them “winter’s ice cream”بستنی زمستونی😂😂its definitely neither cake or ice cream
Im my country we say hot ice cream
It's a tea cake ✌
These are like luxury Tunnock's teacakes. Pretty traditional old treat in England that began in the 50's. Something everyone's grandparents used to have laying around in their treat cupboard, alongside some caramel wafers and Werther's Originals 😁
It’s like a sweetie pie.
In portugal those are called 'bombocas'.
That's called a TEA CAKE they are biscuits with marshmallow fluff on top. That is a tea cake. If u wanted cake it needs to be labeled at cake not tea cakes. Tunnocks tea cakes are the best ever and forgive my spelling I'm dyslexic!!
Kinda like chocopie but with waffle instead of sponge ig
Oh, you got one flavor of kisses! Those are cute and delichious light deserts
in Denmark we call them "flødeboller" and yes "boller" is also a word for sex..  😂
Called mumsmums in swedish, means yummy yummy
It's a tea cake/chocolate kiss In the UK, cake is used to call many desserts that aren't cake
In England we call them tea cakes
We get then in South Africa. I'm sure you can get them throughout the year but I usually sea them around valentines day. They're called sweetie pies.
It’s not worth buying at all 😂😂😂 I bought it once and felt lied to so never again
In denmark theyre called "flødeboller" wich i guess kinda translate to "cream buns"
It's definitely not a cake! Here in Brazil we call this nhá benta. It's a marshmallow outlayered with chocolate. The waffle is a base, and sometimes it's not used. It's a common treat to eat with coffee or hot chocolate in malls.
These are called “بستنی زمستونه” here in Iran, It basically translates to “winter appropriate ice cream”. Used to love them as a kid but now they’re just too sweet for me. And no, It’s not a cake!
Those are delicious tho, I really like them XD
It's a Crembo! It's an Israeli treat!
When I was a kid we used to put them (in austria it's called schwedenbomben) on the table get blindfolded und eat it without hands. Mostly only at birthday parties. Very funny
We call it winter icecream in Iran
You want to eat American style food, you stay home.
These are called tea cakes, there’s a old brand called Tunnocks tea cakes that still sell in stores in the uk and Ireland😆
In Iran we call it "winter ice cream" 😅
In the philippines, we have a version of that u can buy at the supermarket called "chocomallows"
It’s not a cake it’s a special candy in Germany
We call it "winter ice-cream" in Iran
It's delicious tho. Before buying something, better clarify what you wanted. 😩
This is also known as Flødeboller in Denmark. It’s a very common treat.
In Denmark we call this a flødebolle or a cream bun. People usually buy them for their birthday but I don’t think anyone I know who would describe it as a cake.
Cake or not, they look good so idc Imma eat it 🤩 I never tried it tho, I wanna try someday
We sometimes have things called tea cakes which are soft biscuits with a mountain of marshmallow on top then covered in chocolate x
In Israel it's called "krem-bo", which translates to "cream inside"  You can usually see them around winter time and they're a delight!
Its what we Call “flødeboller” its really good! :) its a treat/Dessert here
Called Krembo in Israel lmao
here in brazil we know those as teta de nega, its a fun treat i used to eat a lot when i was younger, definatly not a cake doe, its just that in some parts o the world it is also called teacakes!
It’s a “ flødebolle”, as we Call it in Denmark. They are yum.
I see them stalls every Christmas and bro they're so overpriced for such small things especially since they take your for a joke!
What a bunch of crap! I'd be disappointed too.
thats why research First before conclusion..
Where I'm from we call those tarrboosh which translates to fezz because it's almost shaped like a fezz hat
in Brazil they're called tits lol
Oh, my country has those. In Perú those are a popular treat called Besos de Moza. I had no idea other countries had it under a different name. KFJDKFJ
What a disappointment
Germans gave this chocolate a Racist name it's still used there and there and now they use Chocko küssen
We call them Teta de Nega in Brazil and It's a bit of a racist name meaning "black women's breast", some people call them by the two different brand names Dantop or Nhá Benta depending on the region
It look so good.
In Denmark we call it flødeboller
We have it in my country . It's known as winter ice cream . Because they look like ice cream with white inside and chocolate cover . They are actually pretty popular as winter treats .
It’s not a cake, but these things are amazing, I love them so much
Trust me dear, that isn't a Ferrero. Ferrero are kind of an Italian thing and they don't have marshmallow fluff inside, but a sort of thick milk cream. However, they are a Christmas staple and you're right, not a cake.
This is called : Beso de Moza in Perú. Translation: Maidens Kiss
Outrageous.
Looks like a Viva Puff.  They're terrible.
This is nearly everywhere in Europe, it’s soooo good Definitely not cake tho haha
That's a Sweetie pie
It’s a tea cake
Me Who knew immediately what it was as soon as I saw it: mhm yes c a k e
Ngl they aren't advertised as cakes so in all honesty it's your mess up. Plus, they're obviously made of marshmallows.
In Brazil they are called "teta de nega" as a popular name, and is a bit racist
coming from a muslim family and not able to eat regular pork gelatin based marshmallows, if i took a bite of this, thinking it was marshmallow, it would've been a nightmare.
PROOAGANDA
Fake cakes filled with disappointment.
I first glance I wouldn’t of thought that could possibly be a cake. 🤔
Nah I would've been disappointed too
ras abed
Aaaawww Schaumkuss .... God only knows how many of these I ate as I lived in Germany
How can you disappointed with the most beautiful chocolate kisses I've ever seen?? Cake is overated anyways hh
I love those! They’re mainly in Europe though, please don’t hate on them please😢
T
Loved it when I was a kid! Here in Brazil we call it "Teta de nega", and it was very easy to find back at the 00's. For some reason, it isn't that common anymore. I miss it, that's for sure. 🇧🇷
If I knew it was fluff I’d be thrilled but that is the opposite of caaaaaaake. Def not 🍰   Your “disappointment is unmeasurable” 😂 😂
Like a fancier tunnocks tea cake
I'd take that over a cake any day of the week lol
It's like a mellow cake they're common where I live
I saw those in stores in boxes for cheap 🤣🤣
You're calling this "a lie", only because you're expecting something else?
i believe thats a meringue filling, actually! Meringued are considered cakes where I live, and that sort of cake is often made into what we call a pavlova its honestly my favourite cake, nothing can compare. would have loved this too!
ah, teta de nega. always loved eating a bunch in parties here in brazil lol
in england there is a sweet dessert called tea cake and it is chocolate mashmellow fluff and biscuit or waffle on the bottom exactly what you ate i think you misunderstood what it was so it wasnt a lie it was just the name of the desert that is traditionally ate with cup of tea like tea biscuits
Ohhh these are popular in scandanavia, it looks yummy
Bruh I've been to so many Christmas markets is coz ur from the US shush
Manchester UK?! My home town?! … I mean… the Christmas markers and food here aren’t the best so I’m not surprised 💀😂 bless for trying though haha
:(
In England we call those tea cakes lol
It's very popular in Israel and we call it Krembo
Flødeboller. These mfs are everywhere in Denmark istg
Kinda reminds me of tea cakes!
Those are crembo
isn't that a teacake
It’s a tea cake. In the uk they eat a thing called tunics tea cake that are mostly marshmallow fluff
Next time it would do you good to research about the food you buy before posting stuff like this. These are tea cakes and they are common here in England. Just because it’s called a “cake” doesn’t mean they have to be the traditional cake we all know about.
In England we normally call them tea cakes so that might be where the confusion is coming from  Definitely not a cake but still kinda called cakes
It is a cake but it is called a tea cake its what u have with tea
The people who made these watching this video:  👁👄👁
In poland we call this "ciepłe lody" it's literally "warm ice cream". I loved this treat as a kid because it was extremally sweet but most adults don't really like it
Called a teacake….check out tunnocks
omg ive seen them before i almost got one im so glad i didn't now
It's called a "tea cake" and it's pretty normal
We have these in Lebanon. We call them  tarboush which means "fez hat". They're so good.
In Germany u get them for two Euros a pack of 14 and they are called dickmanns lol
Its It's tea cake! Though I don't know why they just said cake:/
These are everywhere here and also (in my personal opinion) absolutely disgusting
OMG jeanell I live in Manchester were you in picaddily gardens near the arndale centre? Cause if you were that's INSANE!!!!!
I can't believe u never tried these before xD They're a bit expensive and just... they have nothing special to them but u can tell they're marshmallows from how light they are xD
In denmark it a flødebolle. “Cream bon”
Everyone here sharing how they call it in other languages, but you don't wanna know what they're called in portuguese...
I love these!
That is a flødebolle.
Ok girl! I would be disappointed too
Awhhhh thats what we call a "winter ice cream" Probably bc parents dont want to feed their child something cold in the winter
We called in Arabic ابو العبد and it is veryyy tasty we ate when we were kids
We call that cremebo in israel but it has whipped cream inside
Its like krambo
In Austria we call those either Chocolate kisses or Schwedenbomben, "swede bombs" lmao
Maybe this just got lost in translation.   They're very popular in Germany, but we would never call them cake!  We call them "Schokoküsse" (chocolate kisses), "Schokoküsschen" (little chocolate kisses), "Dickmann" (Fat Man) or "Negerkuss" (black person's kiss).  Due to British and American influence on the German language, the last name has fallen out of favour, even though the German word "Neger" used to be neutral and not derogatory.
This is what we call “teta de nega” here in Brazil The name translate for something like “black boobs” so… it’s not that correct  But it’s called like this because the shape-
In portugal we call it "bomboca", it doesn't have a translation, so I understand why they called it cake. I don't know where it is traditional from, but I really like one with banana filling, its just like the one in the video but the marshmellow kind of filling is banana flavoured
That's a tea cake
A variation on a tea cake I suppose, except wafer instead of a biscuit base and no jam
Yeah it's not good mind I was disappointed to it's not  a cake
Thats a teacake!
They meant cake in another way
For the confusion in the uk they are often called tea cakes so that’s why they are called cakes
In hungarian it's called habcsók the english translation for it is foam kiss we dont usually have waffle on the bottom it's just the cream filling covered in chocolate all over
It is not a cake it is dessert called crembo from Israel
Here in denmark, they are called "flødeboller", or "nigerboller", but that's an old way of saying it and no longer politically correct. (It means what you think it means)
In here they are called chocolate kisses
I think they just have a bad translation.
We have that in my country too, i hate that stuff, just tastes like sugar.
In Israel they are called krembos and they are the BEST id take these over a cake any day of the week! (It’s a shame they are only a seasonal treat)
This LIE 🤣 loll
In Denmark this is called a flødebolle or cream puff. They are exactly like this and are one of my favorite treats. We often get them for birthday parties at school
We have those here in Brazil, some people call them Nha Benta and some call them Teta de Nega. I prefer the first name, the second one is kinda weird and I won't even translate.
I'm with you. That's not a cake. I would be disappointed as well. Should be described as a chocolate treat or candy not a chocolate cake.
We call many things cakes that are not sorry welcome to the U.K.
This is a crembo! ( for all my Israeli friend's)
i think these little ‘cakes’ are everywhere in Europe! I’ve seen them being called ‘Chocolate Kisses’ or ‘Teacakes’, but my mum and I have always called them ‘Bombocas’ which is the Portuguese word for them! ☺️
These are called slave head in my country.....
This is called bomboca in Portugal, but we do not considere it a cake
It used to be called a ‘niggerkiss’ here in The Netherlands. For obvious reasons now it’s called a fluff kiss or chocolate kiss lol
Israel: oh wow I like tht imma call them Krembo like cream inside Poland: ikr, we also have this thing we call ciepłe lody cuz like warm cream Israel: let's bring it to the UK  UK: oh it appears like a cake to me and it goes well with my tea. Imma call it tea cake 😂
I remember I used to eat thid as a kid in Jordon. They were called Raas al abid They are not cake tho They are a lot different
Its like a tea cake
In Denmark we Call these “Flødeboller” and we usually hand Them out for birthdays at schools lol
That is in danish called a flødebolle and at school you would always give that out on your birthday
It is a tea cake. Idk why it has the word cake in it but just like how in places like the uk we call chips crisps vise versa
I WAS THERE I WALKED PAST THERE I CANT BELIEVE I MISSED YOU
In Israel this is called "Krembo" "קרמבו" In Hebrew
we call them tea cakes usually but they have biscuit at the bottom not waffel
It’s a tee cake it’s chocolate mash mellow and a biscuit\waffle It’s a British thing
This in my country🇺🇾 is called "Ricardito" and it is something that is sold all year round, it is almost a typical dessert
rude
Im from the netherlands, we have those and i loveee them. We changed the name tho.
Where I’m from those things are known as nubecitos (little clouds) not a fan but they’re alright haha
It’s Crembo in Israel🇮🇱❤️
That’s Denmarks favourite desserts and on danish it’s called flødebolle directly translated to creambun
I love these
im seeing that everyone has a different name for them but the main point of this video is that they should be called disappointment cakes
That fluff is a merengue.
Hehe...it's just a matter of different culture. Like what is called "biscuit" in US but it turn out eventually to be a cake/bread and not a crackers (crispy) 😆
When I saw the shape I immediately knew what it was 😂
Ayoo I'm a Manc!
It’s a tea CAKE very very very British delicacy do not disrespect
Omg your eating it wrong!!
In Denmark we call this a flødebolle and I would definitely not call it a cake
It's very popular here in Lebanon lol and it's very cheap not luxury at all lol
That’s a sweetie pie in South Africa 🇿🇦 or formally known as a chocolate kiss or a marshmallow pie!!! That is not a cake, it’s a confectionery!!!
Technically the waffle is the cake part.
In my country those are a local treat called Choco Mallows, it's exactly like that "cake" but smaller, around the size of your palm
In Israel, we called it "krembo". Definitely not a cake but soooooo good
I would have been maddd tooo!
In Poland we call it a hot icecream (ciepłe lody)
South Africa calls them Sweetie pies
If you grew up in German, you’d call this childhood memories!
Basically a walnut whip with a waffle bottom
In denmark it’s a flødebolle 😂 and not a cake😂
We call them Sweetie Pies in South Africa.
In Denmark we call them flødeboller (cream buns) They are not cakes. We eat them with ice cream.
We call that "beijinhos" or "bomboca" in Portugal, that literally means "kisses" or bomboca that means like, a sweet snack
Norway here, we call these “kokosbolle”; coconut bun (?). They’re super delicious and I’ll give myself one of these on special occasions to treat myself. I could immediately tell by the shape what it was, and I think most Europeans would. So I think the mixup here is that it’s taken for granted that the guests have the necessary references of knowledge to know what they’re getting. The stand could benefit from an ingredient/content table or a picture of a cut piece - but it sort of blew my mind that apparently this isn’t an immediacy recognizable shape for someone 😅
It’s like a tea cake that’s what we call it in Scotland, it’s basically biscuit bottom instead of the waffles, mallow filling covered in chocolate sooooo good😋 but yeah we call it cake too😂
Being sulky over a Ricardito 😮
These are soo good,in the Netherlands these are called negerzoenen,and they come in all size’s and kinds of chocolates
Sweetie pie!
In Denmark we call it a flødebolle😂
There tea cakes 🤦‍♀️
Un ricardito
OMG THE MOMENT I SAW THIS THE IMAGE OF SOMETHING WE CALL “رأس العبد" IN JORDAN BURNED IN MY HEAD. it’s this sweet you always find kids eating and almost all of us grew up eating it whether you lived in the country or not, if you visit family there you’re bound to eat at least 3-4… A DAY.
We call them tea cakes in scotland :)
Its a typical storebought dessert in israel called krembo (like saying filled with crean in a word)
Flødeboller!!!
this is called Nhá Benta in Brasil, it’s really good and it’s one of those nostalgic foods from our childhood that you eat sometimes
זה קרמבו
Tbh i expected that but i wouldnt be dissapointed...i LOVEEEE marshmallows
Danish word is flødebolle
They're called Tea cakes. A biscuit base with chocolate covered fluff
It is called luxury. And we all know that rich people talk differently from normal people XD.
It’s a Teacake in the UK 😂
You are eating it wrong i live in denmark where those are in evey store
We have them in the netherlands Too! i imdialty recognised it as a one  so I was surprised you called it a cake hihi. In dutch it used to be called a ' neger zoen' translated to english  as' kiss from a neger' but now it just goes by 'Zoen' to keep it safe.
I love those. In South Africa we call it a sweetie pie
In Germany we call them Morenköpfe or I know them as Dickmanns as well I dont really like them anymore but my aunt makes a cake with them every christmas
BAKA USO DAYO
Hope the guy working there doesn’t get any hate since you showed his face and his lil stall all because you didn’t understand what you were buying… this isn’t hate… just a lil worried.
these r one of my favorite treats in lebanon they’re called tarboosh
Normally we xall that a tea cake in the uk. Like the cheap ones comes as 6 for £1
In Brazil those are very famous, we call them "Teta de Moça" which literally means "Lady's Tits" lmfao I recognized them immediately when the video started, they're definitely not a cake lol
Tea cake
I'm so with you....it's not cake and not very good marshmallow
We call these flødeboller which roughly translates to heavy cream bun but this is typically a marzipan bottom or thin waffle with whisked egg white and sugar and then covered in chocolate. Personally in English i would call these cream buns not cakes 😂 idk why they decided to call it a cake maybe it's the waffle idk
We have them all year round here in sweden, we call them skumtoppar, meaning foamtips, cause its a sweet fluffy vanilla marshmellow kinda thing inside of the chocolate
TECHNICALLY they’re not cakes. Tbh. But in the UK we don’t care lol. We have these things that are JUST like that called tea cakes.
We call them teacakes in england so if you dont live here your likely to be tricked i guess
How do you not know what it is? 🤣 It is all over europe! There are amazing! Ah and btw they are called "Schokokuss" (Chocolate Kiss) in Germany.
OH! In South Africa we call them Sweetie Pies! They are given as Valentine gifts because they have a red, pink or white shiny wrapper💞
We have that in Sweden! It is not a cake at all! As soon as I saw the shape I knew she had no clue
The problems these people have... Lol.. but she paid for it so she has the right to do so
'it better be a frikin cake' - I feel that on a different level because I love cakes! Hope you're enjoying your time in the UK Jeanelle
I love them we have them almost every where in denmark :)
It’s called a tea cake in England do Your research before you put down small businesses who are struggling as it is tea cakes they are called I actually like them next time ask what’s in it or what it is.
They're called "flødeboller" in Denmark, and are basically marshmallow fluff on a waffle coated in chocolate.  I can see from the comments that they are also enten other place in Europe. And they are great, but I wouldn't describe it as a cake either.
Oh i don't know why they were named cakes. Here in France we love them but we know the center is white eggs with sugar on a waffle and coated in dark chocolate. And no it's not luxurious 😂
These are a big part of our birthday traditions here in Denmark.. We call them "flødeboller" which translates to "cream buns." We even have a rime about it- "fem flade flødeboller på et fladt flødebollefad!" Seen and had them all throughout my childhood! We'd usually share them with school mates on birthdays or buy them as gifts for birthdays...  And yes.. Not a damn cake- it's a just a chocolate covered and cream filled pastry.
In germany they r called Schaumküsse which translates to foam kisses. Its not a cake at all. It's a schaumkuss. Which is its own thing.
Where I'm from you can get a refund for stuff like that, false advertising is no joke.
In my country we call Them flødeboller "cream-buns" and its not marshmellow fluff
Spoiled brat problems.
you’re in a entirely different place lol just because YOU don’t think it’s a cake doesn’t mean that they think the same thing
They're called a sweetie pie where I come from
Here in Poland these are called warm ice cream cakes/cones!
If you grew up in the Philippines, you can buy something like this in the supermarkets called choco mallows. These are really popular snacks with Filipinos, ask them about choco mallows and they know about it. If you grew up in the Philippines, you'd know about it.
Europeans be like:u really didn't know abt that.. =_=
We call them "Winter Ice cream" Here :D
Manchester?? HEY DSMP FANS
It’s essentially a tea cake here from the U.K…it’s a cake (treat) that you have with tea. Definitely not that horrible camden lager lol. We call most treats cakes😂xxxx
Ohh lol in the uk those are called "teacakes" in the UK and those are definitely luxury ones. Sorry u got fooled 😂
You probably paid loads for that marshmallow,
In south Africa we call that a Sweetie pie. They very yummy😋
That's a niggas kiss
In Israel we call them Krembos.
This is exactly why I absolutely cringe at European Christmas markets. You can be in Manchester, Berlin, Brussels or Milan -- and it's all the same overpriced kitsch. European Christmas markets are such a rip-off.
In Germany they are called: Schaumkuss, Schokokuss, Negerkuss, Mohrenkopf 🤣🇩🇪 I actually like them really much
Oh lol you got  a Sweetie Pie
I am so with you on this! False advertising. That is not a cake LOL
Those are common in finnish stores their name in finland is ”suukko” and that means kiss in english, they’re really good, the store next to my house has 2 different types
We have the same thing ... In Iran it is called a winter icecream ... And yes they're as horrible as you think 😂😂😂
In Denmark we call them "flødeboller", which directly translates to "creambuns". We love them here😁
I never realised you don’t have these on your side of the ocean. Pretty standard European sweets.
In UK I know them as teacakes, they’re a very European thing and usually they’re at most Christmas markets
Lol tea cakes
Its called a tea cake they are meant to have marshmallow and some wafer thing at the bottom as a british person alot of people like these tuat ate British
I live in Manchester, there is this boba place near the Christmas market that i recommended!! Its called "ohayo" u should definitely go try it! I love ur vids ❤️❤️ Keep it upp
Det er en flødebolle
Takes more then that to ruin my day 🙃
It's not a cake, that's right but I think the entire population of Europe would've known what it was the second they saw it haha
In Slovakia this is a think we used to made it but now its harder to find but in mini version and even more
I may not like chocolate cake very much but even I would be disappointed too to have found out that it's not actually a chocolate cake
It’s a tea cake. 😂😂
Lol ew
It’s a teacake
In my country we call them sweetie pies it's given as a token of love
Knew it...
I hate marshmallows too. I feel you 😭
That's is really famous in Germany. I really dislike them but as someone who wants to become a baker i need to learn how to make them at some point😅
Yeah I would so not have been happy too. I not a huge marshmallow fan to begin with. AND The damn sign says "cake" . Grrr
If you search the brand Köhler Küsse images of the store come up. They call them tea cake which in the U.K. means chocolate coated marshmallow with a biscuit base, these have wafers so I presume since she’s at a German market this is the equivalent so they probably called them tea cakes so Brits understand what it is at a glance.
Childhood right there man, loved these.
well yk in europe-
Love marshmallow fluff! Looks yummy!
Americans thinking they’re the centre of the universe again 🤦‍♀️
There's a snack like that in ph
Agreed
SUPER DICKMANNS
These are all over in Germany, I remember buying them in cases. Not cakes.
This is called "crambo" in my country, it only comes in the winter so it's a classic childhood treat for me
Well it's called teacake isn't it? I mean i don't live in the UK but even I know that much that what they call pudding there isn't really pudding
Angel kisses. I’ve had em in middle eastern markets
I'm offended on behalf of the cake. Have you never heard of cheesecake? Banana bread must blow your mind. Don't be rude about other countries food. American food isn't that great either.
Ahhh i rmb this. Saw an ad for it as a kid n thought it would be the most chocokatey delight ever but tye moment i took a bite it was just disappointment. Hatedbit since
I would’ve been so mad because I hate marshmallows LOL
*Brought to you by GLaDOS of Aperture Science*
That’s a tea cake 😂
unenthusiastic
In German these are called “Schokoküsse”. They aren’t technically cake - though that term is interpretable - but they are delicious, at least in my opinion. To each their own!
Here, in Israel, we call them Krembo/Crembo (krem=cream, bo=in it). But here it's mostly in its processed mass produced version. It comes in packages of around a dozen or two, and is basically a simple cookie, light "meringue" (more light and airy than marshmallow fluff), and all of it is covered by a very thin layer of chocolate. Whatever the case is though, we definitely never refer to it as cake.
First world problems
Same was gross qnd I was pissed
Is this a portal reference??
That's like similar to a walnut whip..ik there's another name for it but i don't remember
I lived in England for 15 years. I’ve never once bought that thing. I don’t think I’ve ever seen anyone eat that.
In my country (Uruguay) this is called a "Ricardito" and is NOT a cake.
Am I the only one that read the title in the voice of GLaDOS?! 🤣 The cake is a lie
Those damn Brits, calling all kinds of desserts "cakes" and then calling cakes "puddings", it's all LIES!!😠😂
In Italian these are often called "negretti" and are sold basically at every fair
A little mean to put the name of the stall on blast?
I'm Peruvian and we call it "besos de moza"
I know them. Cheap-o "snack" my great aunt was buying because she was a scrooge. We called them "to jsou ty hnusný" translated it's like "these are the disgusting ones" But it's similar to our "cake" "indiánky" (little indians? Don't know why tho) which is a small base of sponge cake, cream made of butter/margarin filled with eggnog or the middle is made out of egg whites and sugar like in this video. And of course dipped in chocolate. Still disgusting tho
Its called winter ice cream(بستنی زمستونی) in iran.
It's a tea cake...
I see what you did with the title
In Germany they are known as "Schokokuss" translated to "Chocolate kiss"
OHHHH I love TeaCakes but it’s because my British Aunt always had Tunnocks Tea Cakes at her house.
I really don’t get why u r mad. It’s a name they call it
Your Filipino accent just stands out everything you speak English and it's adorab
Title- *exists*  Me- PORTAL REFERNCE?!?!?!?!?!
It's a fancy sweety-pie
Yeah these are tea cakes and they are incredibly good if done right. Biscuit base is the only way
🤣 literally my favourite thing at a Christmas market. Literally what i go looking for
In Poland its named warm ice cream
It’s a tea cake. You usually have them with tea sometimes. I like putting them in the fridge so the marshmallow and chocolate gets cold 😂
Wow. What a complainer. Sad material for a video.
This is a "Teta de Nega" 🇧🇷 not a cake Idk the name of that in english...
its called a teacake in the uk and ireland.
*Portal fans* 👀
It's a teacake.
In Austria we call it "Schwedenbombe"^^
isso não é teta de nega?kkkkkkk
the reviewbrah reference. queen.
That is not a lie, it can be considered a cake. There are cakes that you don't need to bake and just let it chill in fridge.   Not all people can afford ovens or other baking tools that is why a lot of new cakes created that you don't need to bake for it to be considered.
Oh it’s called a tea cake
Yeah I've always not liked those marshmallow cake things. Never really know what they are but theyre popular, especially at the christmas market near me at Lincoln. They have a great medievil market there in an old monestary and the main market is mostly inside and around a the castle.   Highly reccomend Lincoln.
Nowadays definition of cake are getting different. It is still considered a cake. Before, the mindset of people is that cake should be baked but there are even cakes lately that can't be baked you can chill in fridge and as for what she ate, it can still be considered a cake.
It's called a tea cake :)
That’s very popular in Portugal, especially around Christmas. We usually call them “bombocas” and there are a ton of different flavours, the one with the “marshmallow fluff” and just chocolate on top is the original tho
They are absolutely trash,  people rave about them and they are so disappointing
That’s German neigernusa
I would definitely be upset buying something I thought was cake and it literally just being marshmallow
It’s a teacake ! Very popular in UK and Ireland!
If you say cake it better have cake yes.
We call that a crème bow in Hebrew it’s pretty much anywhere but your right it’s not a cake
Is no one gonna call her out for openly expressing her disappointment in an insensitive and ignorant way? She calls these items a lie without even doing any prior research before deciding to post this video and just goes all out bragging about her disappointment out loud? She’s obviously an Asian but a Westernized one and I’m sorry to say this but she has the ignorance of an American.
Those are bombocas 🇵🇹
These are called “mums mums” or “kokosbollar” here in Sweden. They’re not cakes lmao. I think the fluff inside is made by egg whites and sugar :)
Scam, but this is german or dutch by origin. I am dutch and as a fun fact; they used to be called "negen zoenen" which was often mispronounced as the dutch n-word followed by the word: "Kisses". They changed the name to "chocolade zoenen".
It is a Ricardito
Manchester in England?? I live there lol that's quite cool
These are Dutch chocolate kisses...
It's called "Schokokuss" (chocolate kiss) in Germany. It's usually sold at supermarkets in packs of like 30 small ones or 9 big ones, and usually covered with dark chocolate, white chocolate or milk chocolate, sometimes coconut or special flavours. It's quite popular here but it's usually sorted under chocolate candy and not cake :D
I feel this.  I hate when I get disappointed with food.
It’s called a Tea cake, they are a biscuit with a marshmallow on top, covered in chocolate.
Never had a kiss before? They're great!
Those are called kisses here in Finland.
That is a zoen, a dutch desert
That's a cake. We'd call that a tea cake in England
Funny thing, these are called chocolate kiss in Germany, they were called n-word kiss until a few years ago tho. Cause.. They're brown.
In Israel there is a brand of that called Krembo and its so fucking good! Need a vegan version now tho :(
Ice cream cake, cheesecake, jelly cake, I refuse to acknowledge them as cake, and I'm glad someone agrees.
Those are very popular here in Brazil. But we definitely don't call them cake though.
Well I Manchester the ,ay call it something different
Hey there if did not know it is a tea cake
In Poland we call it "ciepłe lody" which means warm icecream
Those are sweetie pies In South Africa lol
We have a really unorthodox name for that in Brazil, which is "teta de nega" or "black woman's tit"
They're supposed to be like that, but who had the brilliant idea to call it a cake? Because it's definitly not
These are crembo in Israel. They were always expensive so we didn't get them often but def not a cake
In denmark we call this a "flødebolle" which means whipped cream bun. I honestly thought they only existed here.
Isn't that super dickmann  (I think that's what it's called)
in Israel its called krembo
In Poland my family calls it Ciepłe Lody XD Its weird, it means warm ice cream and makes no sens haha
אוחח קרמבו my beloved
It’s a tea cake lmaooo
Det er jo en flødebolle🤦🏼‍♀️
Nice portal reference 😳
We call it habcsók which is basically foam kiss- There is places where they call it a cake but its definitely not that
Going there on saturday! It’s great 👍
Americans... 😑 You find those things all over Europe. No, it's not a cake, it is better than cake. It is delicious.
THIS IS THE MOST DELICIOUS THING EVER.
Here in uruguay and Argentina we call those "Ricarditos" and have meringue in them
technically a waffle IS made of eggs flour milk Ecc
The cake is a lie
they’re deliciousssss i love them
I never thought about that this is Dutch.. there are kisses if you translate it directly, we call it ‘zoenen’ or ‘chocolade zoenen’. And it’s definitely not a cake, pretty good but not a cake so i get the disappointment.
We have that in Denmark too! We call it a flødebolle (literally meaning cream bun)  It's quite common here ~
Here in israel those are named krembo, when i saw the shape i immediatly thought it looked familliar..
These are called nhá bentas here in Brazil and while I'm bias i absoloutly love the maracujá ones. But yeah their not cakes-
They’re called Flødeboller
as a brit this is hilarious, they’re called tea cakes- while i agree not cakes, here it’s still classed as one haha
This is called "krembo" here in Israel, which translates to cream inside of it.. Not a cake but very popular winter treat
They are delicious
That’s a tea cake!!!
I always wondered about this…well good thing I didn’t waste my cash
Did the stand say tea cake because that's a tea cake in the UK 🤣
Those are tea cakes sure. Not lying technically
These are called Mellow cakes and it is in fact home made marshmallows, it’s a super popular holiday treat in Northern Europe

It’s called teacakes and they aren’t actual cakes they are just a treat
We eat this yummy sweets in Austria and Slovakia. It is delicious😋 I loved it as a child. It doesnt taste like marshamllo. It taste quite unique. Never tasted anything like that. So i am speechless for you😀 It’s very yummy but yes, if you expected cake then it is more like a yummy creamy bonbon😀
I'd be pissed too lol
In Israel it calls “creambo”- cream inside. It’s usually an unbaked egg meringue on top of a biscuit coated in chocolate. And it’s in the supermarkets only in the winter
Those look like topkuss lol
It's a "bomboca" in portuguese Is a desert that I like a lot, idk where is from but normally the most seld here is strawberry flavor.

In Italy is called Moretto or Negretto
I’m from uk….. trust me I was equally as disappointed
In Brazil is called "Maria Mole"
It is called zoen😂😂 you can get it in the Netherlands to. I geuss it is just really hard to describe. At the bottom you have a waffle٫then you got a kind of whipped cream and then a layer of chocolate. It should be looking like that.  Ps. your videos are amazing ❤️❤️❤️
Thats called a tea cake
We call them Dickmann or Schokoküsse (chocolate kiss)  in Germany

קרמבו!!
The title is so close to being a Portal reference. Really jumbled my brain there for a minute.

In Poland we call that "ciepłe lody" xD
It's called "krembo" in Israel, which means "cream in it". The filling is made of whipped egg whites and sugar and there's usually a cookie in the bottom. One of our favorite winter snacks.

It looks exactly like a chocolates kiss. Just because your in a foreign country and you don’t gets stuff doesn’t make it  a lie
I’m from Manchester, don’t disrespect our crimbo markets yeah? You should definitely try Jaffa cakes if you haven’t already, they’re not a cake per say but there is a dispute between whether they’re a cake or a biscuit 😅 Delicious either way!
The American expectation of "cake" is very different from what most other countries know it as There's different versions of cake
that's a krembo ma'am
Yess Camden hell's is the best beer

False advertisement. You should sue for emotional damages

A GRINGA BRABA PORQUE COMEU TETA DE NEGA ACHANDO QUE ELA BOLOOOOOO KKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKJJJ
She ate KREMBO and it's delicious  KREM - cream  BO - inside  😜😜😜
Not so fun fact: these used to be called Negerküsse in Germany which translates to nigga kisses (please don't come for me, I am just translating a name) and people have only kinda recently started to call them Schokoküsse (chocolate kisses) They're super popular during Christmas and whenever any kind of faire is happening, but they're also popular on birthday parties and things like that. Also the food stand in the video is probably German/Swiss/Austrian since the name is in German
In Sweden we call them Munk, they are good but definitely not a cake XD
In lebanon qe called it ras El abed and it is available in every grocerie shop
In Germany u call them Schoko küsse and they r really popular here :) I'll still be disappointed tho that i got this and not a cake 😑
If i say the real name for these i would get cancelled
Ricardito
In Israel it's called Krembo which is exactly this
Ask a German what these are called and you'll get a hundred different replies depending on region, age and political views lmao.
IT'S A TEACAKE, DEFINITELY A CAKE.
Portal
In Israel we call it krembo and it’s not a cake.
It's a very popular sweet in Germany!

Those taste SOOOO GOOD you can get a whole box of them for 2€ here
I’d be mad if I was expecting cake and got marshmallows. I love marshmallows too
This was a candy my dad woukd often eat, here in brazil its called teta de nega and the filling its usually marshmallow
Aren't those Tea cakes (sometimes known as chocolate kisses)? That filling's not marshmallow either 🤣 Someone misinformed you HARD. This is why you should always ask the person that's selling them to describe what you're buying lmao
Calm down hen, they’re called tea cakes.
These are pretty common in Europe you find them in every bakery ❤
These are everywhere in Europe and here in Finland they used to be called something very inappropriate 😬 nowadays it's called a "suukko/pusu" which means kiss.
That’s Nha benta idk why people would describe it as cake though
Schwedenbomben 😍
Theyre actually called tea cakes in Ireland…biscuit/ waffle topped with marshmallow and coated in chocolate
Girl .. stop being boring
Here they are called "flødeboller"
Thats a "chocolate kiss" in Germany! It's typical for christmas Markets
In Israel it’s called crembo and you can only buy them during the winter
I know what that is its called a snow man
This is also common in the Netherlands. We used to call them "n*gerzoenen" but that's the Dutch version of the n-word. Now we just call them "zoenen" aka Dutch for Kisses
In Portugal we call those "bombocas" they're sooo good 😍
That's called a  mums mums in Sweden.
In Denmark we call them flødeboller
I would rather call it Mallows not cake.
That’s called a Dickmann (nice name in english, in german its fat man) its delicious in my opinion, but indeed not a cake. You can usually buy it in packs of 12 so they last a little longer
The fact that it was a Ferrero should have been your first hint that it wasnt a cake. You shouldn't be saying it was disappointing when it wasn't even what you are trying to compare it to...doesnt everyone know what those are? Guess not ..weird considering you're a food channel🤷‍♀️
I had this same thing in Edinburgh Christmas market..it was yummy 🤤
It's those teacakes
In Denmark this is called "flødebolle"
The named this « cake » because the old name in french at least was « tete de n-word », literally means « head of n-word »
Someone get this girl a tea cake XD like what did u expect it be when your in Manchester
I live in Manchester! Walk past the stalls every day, way too expensive tho
those are called flødeboller (translates to "cream buns) in denmark they are sort of like a national favorite
I absolutely love those. They were called black man's kiss
in slovenia we call these "indijančki". they sell them all the time throughout the year, its definetly not cake though.
but it looks better than cakes
Those are tea cakes so not a total lie lol
It's a teacake, and it is soft and contains flour and such. The classic contains a small blob of raspberry jam and is the food of childhood dreams. Also, you're eating it wrong.
That's a tea cake
Those are "hot ice creams" in Poland, like litearlly "hot ice creams"
It is a cake…. It’s a TEACAKE
This is Krembo not a cake 😅
Meanwhile in Germany 😭😭🤐
OH NOOO! I love tea cakes! Next time try Tunnock's tea cakes, I'm not sure if they're sold outside of the UK, but now you know what to expect when biting into a tea cake, Tunnock's WILL NOT disappoint you. ❤️
Ah yes, a teacake. Very dividing
It’s like a Beyers Sweetie Pie, and they’re so yummy👏🏻
In Portugal we call it bomboca
Isn't that a chocolate kiss? I'm from Germany and we eat those
Here in Scotland they're called teacakes, not really cakes but goes well with a nice cuppa. The store ought ones fkn slap tho x
I've always called them Krembos. A bit of googling tells me that's the name Strauss in Israel calls them. Makes sense, as the ones I've had were imported from Israel.
here in brazil we call it "nha benta" (don't really know why) and unfortunately they are not that popular but i really like them. it's definitely not cake tho and I would probably be disappointed too lol
Yeah we call em tea cakes here…

Lol nope that is a negerzoen(yes that is what they are called in The Netherlands)
They're called teacakes!
I'm from England and they are tea cakes. They are normally a biscuit layer with a light fluffy marshmallow coated in chocolate and can contain jam in
Those are Dickmann's, in bavaria we called it N****kopf.. I censored the word cus some thought its racist to call them like this.. Its like the N-word, but they not meant like this..
my dude, do not freaky out. but over here where i live in Brazil thats called a "black woman tit" (not really a n word but something that sound similarly, a "nega". it has no harmful meaning)
The cake is a lie.  glados has entered the chat.
Technically this does fall under the definition of cake The waffle based is made out of flour eggs sugar and it's decorated  With chocolate Not to mention it is sweet It's just not what you expected
By the shape and looks of it I thought it was pretty obvious what it was— cultural differences, huh?
So I went to the cafeteria and wanted to try something new. I saw about 2 or 3 plastic containers with chocolate something inside their freezer which looked like Icecream. Since it was pretty hot, I wanted to eat something cold to eat, so I bought it. When I got to opening the lid, lo and behold it was chocolate cake. I couldn't give it back now that I opened it and I already paid so I took it, trying my best to not look disappointed. My friend asked me what I bought and I just awkwardly showed it before taking a scoop. Then we were told to go meet in the library for a group meeting, which I couldn't go in since I still had cake to eat, now I'm stuck in front of the library glass door eating the cake as fast as I can. Still wanted Icecream tho
That's a very common candy in Brazil. Reminds me of childhood and It's called dinda...
is that super dickman? someone correct me on that
That's a mellowcake!!
Cookies are called biscuits over their so no surprise the cakes not cake.
“to be fair” there’s plenty of other ‘cakes’ like tea cakes… so it’s not a lie  IMO don’t be mad/disappointed that foods abroad are different from what u thought they would be. like this is a joke…right?
Gladys made sure the cake was a lie
this cake has spread its disappointment everywhere bc i thought it was an ice cream 😭
It’s called a tea cake….look it up before trashing another cultures food on the internet? It wasn’t a lie
Here we call it "WINTER ICE CREAM" couse its not cold and it looks like ice cream-
We have it here in Israel it is called קרמבו it's cream with a chocolate shel and a wifer
It's a creambo it's the most delicious thing ever ...grow up jeez
This is really popular here in Europe and it‘s either called Dickmann's (I know sounds stupid in english) or Schokokuss (means chocolate kiss)
I don’t like marshmallows either. Only time I’ll eat one is when it’s melted between chocolate and two pieces of gram cracker
The city I live in (Lincoln) have a really big Christmas market every year and it’s so magical! They had a stall with these but they called them a chocolate kiss! I too was a bit underwhelmed but my boyfriend enjoyed it haha! We had a chocolate orange one
Il from denmark we eat these a lot  and we call Them in danish flødeboller
In iran we call them "bastani zemestooni" That means winter ice cream
It’s a flødebolle
We have these in Iran and they are an old nostalgic snack 🤭
The heck is wrong with u? How about asking a little bit more when u r in different country other than urs... There is this thing called 'cultural difference'... Hello... U can't judge them! U r the one who doesn' know the damn thing! U SHOULD HAVE ASKED!
This is a Scottish cake - it’s called a tea cake- it’s very normal in the uk tbh 😅😂😂
Should’ve gone to Liverpool this year, everyone is VERY disappointed with Manchester CMs this year 😬
So like... when I was a kid I ate an entire box of those. 👁👄👁💦 I now strongly dislike them.
You are so ridiculous
It's sooo yummmyyyyy 😋😋😋😋😋
In iran we call this  " winter ice cream" which is made of marshmallow
Flødebolle!
Ha tarboosh mish cake
This is a typical German treat.
In Israel we call it "krembo" which means cream inside or 'warm ice cream', and it's especially popular in the winter
In Germany we call it “Schoko Kuss” which means “Chocolate Kiss” and it’s like THE chocolate treat of my childhood and many of my friends too but definitely NOT a cake hahaha
It's a sweetie pie!!!!
i love how the comments are so educational about a similar food in their culture ✨
It is a teacake.
Its a teacake, which is a pretty popular snack to eat in Britain 💙
Ricardito
I knew it was marshmallow before you bit it!! I've never seen a cake like that, it reminded me of chocolate covered marshmallow that's sold in France
In Denmark this is called a “flødebolle”. I’m not sure but I think it’s a danish treat.
In the meantime we have a racist name for them in the Netherlands ✨ But it got changed into ‘kisses’ 😅 I just avoid them lol. Hate the waffle, I always eat them separate from the rest.
We call it "warm icecream" lol
God these foodies are getting ridiculous
I wouldn't consider it a cake - literally translated in Danish they are called "cream balls" 😂 I love them, but if you expected cake I get why you'd be disappointed 😂
Pov : your from poland
Good job! You just unlocked the item "krembo", its actually a common sweet is israel (especially at winter) made with a cookie, some sort of egg whip and covered in chocolate, its not that good in my opinion.
Yeahhh they used to have a really bad name in Holland 👀
Go to the Birmingham Christmas market (uk) its so good.
Don't be disappointed yet wait till you hear the German name for these treats
Uh oh, took one look and I knew they were like Eskimo snowballs. It's hard being a foreigner sometimes.
"This is not a cake" the dissapointment 😂😂
In Germany we call this a Schokokuss its quite tasty but it's not a cake
Aye its a teacake while ur there try tunnocks teacakes xx
It’s called a teacake love
In my country (czech republic) we call these in my first language "indians" and I love these! And if I'm not wrong there is actually nothing related to marshmallows in it. It's just that the cream is overly sweet and fluffy.
It’s a teacake grow up
This is called Kermbo (meaning filled with cream) in Hebrew! Not many people like it (including me) but like 90% of Isrealis eat it as soon as winter comes!
It's Krembo
We have this in Austria and other german speaking languages. I don't want to blame you but this is kinda offensive since it is part of our culture, at least where i'm from
Yeah we call these here "warm ice cream"
Maybe its not the typical american type of  cake.
I love that just dump it to me if don't like it
In Iran we call it winter icecream...it's so popular during winter .
yet again... the british have disappointed us in the culinary arts
Maybe educate yourself first 😂😂  the disrespect
here in brazil they were first called "teta de nega" which means black womens tits, but because the name was really offensive, nowadays its usually called "nhá benta"
I now have a craving for Tunnocks tea cakes 😋
It's amazing on buns
In Israel they're called crembo, and here they are a delicacy
Cheesecake Is already not a cake. Why The hell are You Particularly  Disappointed In that things lack of being a cake?
Ahhh, one of those thing that surprises you in a disappointing way.   Paumanhin po. ✌️😄
Those look so good
The fact you didn't know what it is
Basically it isnt even a cake. Its called krembo. The cookie is under the marshmellow cream, and on them theres chocolate kinda like smores
False advertising
Lmao laderach the Swiss chocolate brand makes this but they call it a mine muse it’s filled with an egg white meringue a nougat cookie on the bottom
I thought it was ice cream
I would love to try them. Main point of trying different things when experiencing a new culture.
Its a tea cake...
Yoooooo those are the best!
Ohhh I remember eating that when I was in the Philippines, I think its called Choco Mallows but here in Canada its called Whippets.
That's actually a POTATO
I'd be so sad
We have those in finland first they were called (n word kiss) or something and later just a kiss
Okay but I also got one of these for the first time - and the fact I felt so betrayed... I've liked in England for a lot of my life now.. but it seems they REALLY popular this year.  The waffle was like a fortune cookie but worse, and I even got lime marshmallow floof to ruin the rest of it too-   Cursed, I was so upset. Granted the marshmallow fluff was good though before I hit the like lmao
in denmark we have these. we call them flødeboller, but they’re all over europe
They are teacakes. Not sure why they are called cakes and I've never really thought about it before but they are definitely a very popular British snack. (And one of my favourite)
I dooo not like marshmallow flufff I dislike marshmallows so I would’ve been hurt 😂
Yes, these are tea cakes, a traditional english cake
We have those things in Canada, I have no idea what they’re called though
I love those, my grandma buys them for me when I'm in Brazil. They call them duntop and I love the strawberry ones. I've eaten ever since I was young, I guess I have a childish taste in sweets sorry you were disappointed but I would have gotten every flavor of those duntopsp
ok, not a cake, BUT i used to love this sweet as a kid.
If your at the Manchester Christmas markets you have to go with the Dutch pancakes its what everyone goes for round here 😋
Ooo in Brazil we call them “Nha Benta” My mom loves them I think they are okish
Why do they look like stumpy peens???😭🙊
I’d be disappointed too if I bit into it thinking of a cake 😂
I'm from England and it looks like a fancy tea cake to me, but I'd be disappointed to if I didn't know haha
Haha. I dont like marshmallows as well. I'd be disappointed too if i were in your situation. 😂
This is cheap af like 20 pieces for $2. Yeah it’s just egg whites. Lol
Definitely not a cake
That’s a chocolate kiss… not cake
My disappointment is immeasurable 💀🤣😂😂😂😂 THATS MY FAVORITE PART
Yeah marshmallow is disgusting
I think you didn’t know because you are not English. This is tea cake .. I knew what’s coming because everyone knows what’s inside these .. sorry for your disappointment ..
In Perú we call them "Besos de moza"/"Wench kisses" :D Definitely not cake tho
Its a teacake.
Gimme that rn
I'd be livid, myself.
They're "Schokokuss" in Germany which means "chocolate kiss".
In Germany we call these Chocolate Kiss
In Hebrew we call these Krembo. I used to hate this as a kid
*Minecraft flashbacks-*
"My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined" another lady of culture I see😌💕 (but also I'm sorry about being disappointed in the lil tea cake💀)
In New Zealand they are classed as biscuits called Mellowpuffs.
There's a brand of these mallow cakes called super dickmans in Germany 😭
Ha I am German I knew immediately what it was
The moment I saw those I knew it was a tea cake MARSHMALLOW LOLLL uk is crazy
They're called bomboca in Portuguese. Definitely not a cake. I eat those every Christmas.
Hol' up, YOU WENT TO MANCHESTER?! AND DIDN'T TELL ME?! I was literally there the other week :')
It's a tea cake
i would be even happier if i got a tea cake. it’s not a cake though (yes i know it has cake in the name but it’s not a cake, it’s just where i live 😭)
Omg yummmm
In the Netherlands they used to have a really racist name, now we call them zoenen, aka kisses. When I saw what you were holding up I was like ohhh no she doesn't know what they are! I can imagine that'd be really disappointing.
In Israel this is called Krembo. Cookie in the bottom with fluffy cream on top coated in chocolate
They are called Zoenen in the Netherlands which translates to Kisses!
That is a ‘flødebolle’, definitely not a cake so yeah false advertisement! But they are delicious!
Why would you intentionally RUIN this man’s food cart??😞😞 This isn’t it.
Aww!! Omg heading right back to Starbucks for a cake pop or something haha
Can I offer you a companion cube for your trouble?
In Germany it is not a cake
Those are "Chocolate Kisses"...VERY traditional in europe!
That’s a teacake grow up
Manchester? Heyyyy 🙌🙌
Omg  I love these!!! My mom would always buy them ❤️
What "first world problems" are these?
Oh no that's a very typical sweet here in Germany we would never call it cake though, I'd be disappointed like that too!!!
In Denmark we call them "Flødeboller" roughly translated as Cream Buns. School students sometimes have a tradition for bringing them to class instead of cake for birthdays and such. Really gotten a lot more fancy in the last couple of years.  On the bad side though, they do have a very bad nickname known as "Negerboller". It is literally translated to.. The n-word bun in Danish and some people stubbornly insist on using it, because of "traditions".
These are my favourite 😅
Portal reference 🙏
This isnt a negative thing but you remind and look like my piano teacher!! You're beautiful!
Uncultured af.. we call it crambo in Israel which means filled with cream. And that's how its like in Europe. Try asking before you buy something new.
I had the same experience in London. I was super disappointed. They are just plain and sweet with no other demention. Not for me.
I love these! It's definitely not a cake though...
In Peru we call those a Beso de Moza, they are really tasty
I just had one of those lol and yeah I thought it was cake to
I love marshmallow fluff, i would have died of happiness
its like a tunnocks tea cake but Ferrero
here in the Netherlands they are not really special it is just chocolate kisses
You are soo cute 💚 love your Cooking Girl somuchlove&Respct from Pakistan! Btw When u Said this is not a Cake🤣 How cutely u said it Awwww😉👌
Oh they Are those things… there’s a party game in Germany where you have a race to see who can eat it fastest without hands… I nearly threw up that day and I’ve hated them since.
I instantly know what it was. Here in Germany, it has a rather racist name so I won't name it, but I wouldn't call it cake either.
It's called a dinda
cultural differences aside, they just don't have the mouth feel of a cake but more like a high class smores without the smoky flavor
Teacakes!
these remind me of sweetie pies
In Brazil, they're called nhá benta, and the cheap ones are called teta de nega
In Sweden we call it a "Kokosboll" (Kokos as in coconut, from the coconut shavings I think?)  It's popular in lots of places in Europe, though definitely not a cake
This is more of a snack in the middle east lmao it's called راس العبد it has nothing to do with cake its basically whipped cream covered with chocolate but it has nothing to do with cake
this is a well known treat tho :/
Yeah I agree if I’m gonna get a cake I want cake not marshmallow
⟟ fucking love tea cakes! ⟟ didn’t hear you say what you said in the first part but, I for one love tracakes so much
Those are amazing
They’re teacakes 🙄
Lol I knew that wasn't actual cake the second I saw it
Schwedenbomben are the best
We call this Bastani yakhi in Iran
its a ricardito
I grew up in Germany eating these. No not a cake one bit but they are great.  Keep in mind when you are traveling in other definitions vary so maybe instead of slamming, you actually learn first.  Lie is a strong word and have to say im disappointed in your reaction and behavior. Nor is this marshmallow fluff so again ask and learn first. Your expectations will be aligned better
It’s a tea cake. Typically biscuit base with marshmallow top covered in chocolate. Welcome to England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 😂
That's a "krembo" (קרמבו) it's a popular winter snack in Israel, it doesn't actually taste that good but everybody eats it because it's nostalgic
In Germany we say "Schokoküsse". It's a waffle topped with whipped egg white (and sugar) and glazed with chocolate. It's a common thing to get on christmas markets or markets in general.
That's a tea cake
"This cake is a lie!" Portal moment
It is a cake though. Just because it isnt a full out birthday cake doesnt mean it isnt a cake lol, just like rock cakes, those are tea cakes, very different things, but both cakes in different places.
It's not a cake but it's still delicious
I love marshmallow fluff! I'd love those!
Ok dont get me wrong im sure shes right but sometimes her reviews just seem so miserable and rude yes i know i can stop watching her videos but some are ok but most like i said she just comes off as mean and rude
I have to agree they are disgusting 🤮
So why are mochi rice cakes no cakes either 🙄🙄🙄 this is a cultural insult 😑
Those are teacakes
In the Netherlands we used to call these N-word kisses, love that for us💕
i told u there's no good food in uk rubbish even the fish and chip shops are hit and miss sometimes rubbish i'm born her i should no your county usa has good food 💙🇬🇧uk birmingham
Those look like Schaumköpfe. "Cake" is the last translation I would have come up with
In denmark that the thing every kid gave to there classmates whenever it was their birthday.. there also called Flødeboller or if you translate its Cream buns.. pro tip if you dont like that inside it you can just bite the chocolate of ;)
Bro in the Netherlands we call these n**** kisses
I’ve had a similar experience where the inside was a mousse with the thinnest layer of cake I’d ever seen
Here in Portugal we call that a "bonboca" they usually are realy good especialy the strawberry  one and it is for sure not a cake
It's a krembo
girl what why do you always complain about everything 😭
You gotta be careful asking what these are called in Germany, they used to be called the German word that translates to "N***** kisses" but is now called "Schaumküsse" which translates to "foam kisses"
We love those in Finland 😂
Do not dis flød boller
You were ROBBED!!!
Waiitttt? Y’all don’t have this in America?
I don’t like marshmallows unless they’re “cooked” and with smtg else either (ex: hot chocolate, smore...). I would’ve been so disappointed and probably wouldn’t have even taken a second bite.😭
In my country we call this nhá benta, it's a very common popular sweet
It is whats its Called. Teacakes. Take  it as it is. Ur in UK.   These goodies  Aren't  u expected.  Cakes doesnt  have to be spongy.  Good u Guys are exploring to learn  something  New./New terms.  Its  not disappoinment. Endulge
Looks like GLaDOS was here
I love these
It's because they are teacakes! Teacakes are good when you actually like marshmallow fluff
it's a tea cake*
Those are so delicious. In the Netherlands you can buy the basic version at the grocery store. But these "deluxe" ones come in all different flavors. Sooo yummy. They are called Chocolat Kisses over here.
It's a tea cake you eat them on the holidays
That does look like it's very good. However, if I was craving a cake or a brownie like you said and it was nothing like a cake or brownie I would ABSOLUTELY be disappointed! I'd definitely be mad more than disappointed if it was supposed to be a brownie because they're my favorite and once I've gotten my mouth set on one I definitely want that and nothing else!
We call them "Schokokuss" oder "Mohrenkopf" (though you might get cancelled for that lol)
you shouldn't have trusted her Jeanie
I don't know who can call Crembo a disappointment
We have a lot of these in Brazil but we don’t call it cake we call them “teta de nega” means “black woman boobs”
In germany there is a popular brand of these that you should order. "Dickmann's". You can even get "Super Dickmann's"
I think they're Belgian or French, or at least European. Exact same thing happened to me when I was a child, it looked absolutely lovely at the Christmas market, but... I did not like this.
it’s a tea cake  you can get like big packets of them
It’s called krembo in Hebrew and it’s usually the same here but with a cookie as the base
Did you start a YouTube because you’re friend did ..?
the first time i had these i was so, so disappointed lmao. no one told me what it was before, so i just assumed it was some layered cakey thing with hard shell chocolate on top. i like marshmallow fluff, but it just wasn’t at all what I was expected lol
The way I’ve seen like 7 different names for these in the comments
It's a 'kiss' in the Netherlands! They're absolutely not a cake, it's more like a treat in the way that a cookie is
i’m denmark we call it a flødebolle we eat this a lot over here i even ate one today😂
The marshmallow fluf one is a tea cake
In South Africa we call them sweetie pies or cutie pies
In Ireland we call these tea cakes.
It is a flødebolle
Those are called marsh mellow fluffs , originated from Lebanon , nice to know they are ripping off the delicacy
Wait you have never tryed does before i wonder if there is an english name for does
Manchester time
In iran we call this winter ice cream and their available only in winter 😁😁
Tunnocks Teacakes
In Sweden they’re called Mums-mums(Yum-yums) or skumboll(foamball) and I understand the disappointment, looks so good on the outside and then it’s just overly sweet marshmallow-ish stuff…
We had those everytime parents did shopping 😩🥰 how can you be dissapointeeeed🥺 id gladly have this ☝️
We call them bombocas in my country and my mom loves them so much, love to see all the different names
Here in Brazil it have the biggest racist name tho, it's something like a black woman's tits, but in a more childish manner.  Didn't know it existed elsewhere.
I already knew what that was before you started talking. I love chocolate kisses but they definitely aren’t better than chocolate cakes
It’s called a tea cake in the uk
TEA CAKES it is a tea cake
That looks like something from the macaron (macaroon?) Place Whoops!. I thought it was a stack of them but no, it was a sad slice covered in a pile of knockoff marshmallow fluff.
Everyone here knows what a tea cake looks like, so its not needed to be explained what they’re buying
not gonna steal 5he credit but my country invented those... they are called crembo (filled with creme)  and they are traditional made with soft biscuit at the bottom  a huge layer of meringue  and coated with milk chocolate   any other iteration are a spinoff
I've had those from the same place! they're actually giant chocolate kisses! They're... Okay I guess, the mallow is too overwhelming, chocolate a bit too sweet and the wafer usually stale but you get what you pay for lol
In danish Its “fløde bolle”
that's just a giant teacake tbh
This reminds me of buying desserts in China , it looks amazing but you will be disappointed 97% of the time lol
No it's a flødebolle!!! 🇩🇰
I am so happy I found your channel, your narrating is amazing ♥️
Ah yes the tea cakes they’re not perfectly named but love them personally
Thats like a beso de moza, one of my favourites. I can understand why you were dissappointed but honestly those are so good. But instead of a waffle its normally a soft cookie like base
Lol here in Israel it’s krembo
In Finland we call those kisses. A mini waffle with fluff inside covered in chocolate. We have different flavours of fluff too theres strawberry, vanilla and chocolate as the basics.
This is actually a very israeli snack called crembo. It's very known here and is a staple for every israeli. I actually use it to make smores sometimes and use some gram crackers. Normally there isn't a little waffer but a cookie. I definitely recommend trying it as a smores (even tho I don't know anyone that does it) but it's really yummy. Thought it would be good for u to know😊
Apparently English is not universal. English in UK is not the same as English in US, just like in Spanish.
Its krambo
I'ts called flødebolle in danish i think I'ts made of egg white and sugar
That’s a tea cake
In Israel it's called krembo and it's not a cake lol
Too bad, soo sad  🥔
Its a swetypie they are the best
It’s called a schokokuss (german), in English it’s called chocolate kiss :D
We call them chocolate heads in the French part of Switzerland, definitely not a cake!
In Denmark we call it a ‘flødebolle’ and it’s a tradition on your birthday you take it to skole and share with everybody in your class
Calling something you're not used to a lie 😂
That's a mellow puff lmao
If there's a waffle on the bottom we call them Topcas and I recognized it right away lol
That’s a tea cake.  Those taste best on soft serve ice cream.
Those are English tea cakes. And they are chocolate covered marshmallows. X
As soon as she said "craving a *cake* " I was like *uh oh* 😂 They're called "flødeboller" (creambuns) in Denmark. So sorry you got deceived
Beso de mosa
It is called a flødebolle😌✋
This is a popular Arab treat too, basically a marshmallow-like treat with a soft cookie at the bottom covered entirely in chocolate.  Edit: don’t get mad but I remember they used to call them “black heads” they supposedly changed it but I always remember them being called that.
u don’t know what that is...? is it an american thing or is it just u?
i had a friend who’s family sold these at their german shop when i was a kid!! i’m not a marshmallow person but these are delicious af
We called them winter ice cream in iran
in the UK we call that a tea cake so that maybe where the confusion is :)
That's a tea cake in the UK that's a thing. A tea cake is waffle with marshmallow on top covered cake
Øhm my Dude Thats a flødebolle
I find them very good here in France But I understand the disappointment if you were expecting a cake ;)
"The cake is a lie" Portal reference?
In Israel this is  called crembo, that because there is a cream in side it(cream bo)
They are called teacakes here in the UK
Every German knew exactly what this was
I would've been so happy if I came across a shop full of different flavours or chocolate kisses 🍫💋 ☺
we have these in jordan! it’s just a sweet treat but definitely not a cake
This is what i would call a "warm ice cream" in Poland It's really good but yeah it is not cake and not even ice cream
קרמבו
NOOOOOOO GO TO THE XMAS MARKET IN BRISTOL
ES UN RICARDITOOOOOO
Okay they don’t look how normally traditional brownies or cake looks that should have been the first red flag. I don’t feel bad that she was disappointed worse things in this world than getting a waffle instead of cake wow
In Italy we call those things bacio "singular"/ baci "plural"
It’s a tea cake!
Oh yea, this is a "Schwedenbombe" and it's commonly sold at christmas markets in Austria and Germany. It's really no cake at all though
Yeah I bought some from a Christmas market in the uk, thought wow they're good value! Got home and was rather disappointed!
Thats a chocolate kiss-
idk man, i’m not a picky person. you give me something? 9 times out of 10, i’m eating it. if it’s a surprise? oh well. i’ve mixed all the condiments in my fridge and drank them, it can’t be that bad.
Ohhh I love theseee🤤 In Iran we call them winter ice cream😋
That's a chocolate kiss, and I honestly thought other countries had it. But I guess it's something only available in germany and other European countries
That is a tea cake.
If you want a small piece of cake eat cake pops
It's such a childhood snack. It was called "warm ice cream" but in Polish. Back in the day and it was sold on a waffle cone like real ice cream :D
Wait you guys are in Manchester????
Flødebolle
זה לא קרמבו??
That's a beso de moza :0 its weird that they call them cake when its made out of meringue, a cookie as the base and chocolate coating
The reviewbruh reference 😂 💯
They’re called teacakes i know it’s confusing 😅
Oh! When I lived in Peru I’ve had so many of these, they were called Beso De Mosa and uuuuggghhh the were so addictive 😩✨ but they came in this box of like 9 & now they even have different flavored fillings
Yes, that's not a cake. But as a German, it's so obvious to me that those are Schokoküsse. Must have been so disappointing to bite into them thinking there would be cake.
In the netherlands we can just buy it at the local grocery store, we call them 'chocolade zoenen' don't get why they called them cakes tho
Yikes those american people  Allwais wineing
That’s what we call teacakes
The second I saw that I knew exactly what it was gonna be. In Poland we put those on ice cream cones and call it warm ice cream.
WE BUY THAT ALOTT and it's so yummy
This is called Besos de Mosa in Peru where I am from and it’s a sweet  fluff of meringue coated in a thin layer of chocolate. And yeah sorry that they mislead you that it was supposedly cakes of United States 😂. Much love from Peru 💖✨
That’s exactly what I expected the inside to look like
It's called a tea cakes xxx
Like bro if I bite into a cake and I find out it's a chicken sandwich imma send u 2 god
T......that's a schokokuss how dare the saying it's a cake ......
I was once disappointed of a cupcake too, I was craving the frosting on top of the cupcake after yrs lock in Quarantine and it turned out that the frosting was actually marshmallows it was simply disquised as a frosting
"You live on a throne of lies." Hahaha 🤣🤣
Who are you to dis a small business. Go back to where you come from.
In Lebanon, we call then tarboosh because they look like the traditional hat named tarboosh!!!
I don't even wanna know how much this cost-- In Germany these are called "chocolate kisses" (formerly "n-word kisses💀) and you get 10 of them for around 1 euro
I hate those things
It's called Choco Mallows in the 🇵🇭 🤣
Its called a crambo in Hebrew its a very popular winter Treat in Israel, because it's so hot in Israel we can only have it in Winter therefore it's one of the most popular candy we have in the Winter it's very delicious although we don't use waffle we use cookies
It's a teacake
My dad bougt one of these and they looked so good. But to my dissapointment they were filled with cream just like yours. It had no flavour at all.
An American offended by the fact that they don't understand a different culture and a difference in use of language? Groundbreaking really. Totally unexpected
U shouldve told them tht those arent cakes, i wouldve told them tht
Basically a dickmann's from Germany
In Iran we call it winter ice cream
In Britain, where I live, the Tunnock's Chocolate Tea Cake is a vintage treat! It consists of a biscuit bottom and soft marshmallow top, smothered in chocolate.  They are admittedly not a true cake but are a  true British classic!  So, these 'cakes' you sampled are a variation of the old classic Tea Cake that we adore in the UK. Try the original sometime, you'll love them!
It’s called a teacake 😂
It is called in Hebrew Krembo
U dont know this one... I loooovveee it.. Its very very old treat in middle east
We call those a 'flødebolle' in Denmark which translates into cream bun <3 ('fløde' meaning cream and 'bolle' meaning bun.) It's definitely not a cake though
It's a " nha benta " Here internet Brazil and it's one of my favorite desert
I’m from England and it’s called a tea cake it’s marshmallow with biscuit or wafer on the bottom covered in chocolate so that’s why it’s like that it can be confusing to people who aren’t from England 😂😂
I agree totally I hate it when that happens what the hell are they thinking when they say that there is cake in the middle?
Those are flødeboller 😂 or "cream balls"
I hate these :/
It is called a sweetie pie in South Africa
How... have you never had those before?
I love these!!! I get them at a German market the ones I get are covered in dark chocolate. The marshmallow inside is thick and gooey. My brother and I each share a pack
I go to Manchester almost every week
Ahhhh in Britain and some other country's these are called tea cakes they have a biscuity bottom marshmallow on top a coverd in chocolate 😁
Thats بابا غنوج
it’s called a tea cake lmao
They’re called teacakes they’re supposed to be like that.
פאקינג קרמבו בחול
Teacakes!
I hate marshmallows. Plus I bet that ball of fluff was 10 dollars.
In Germany we call this negerküsse.
That's a teacake. Tip: Clarify with the person selling when buying a "Cake". The word cake is tossed around a lot when it comes to desserts
That’s a Ricardito 😂
I’m the uk this is called a tea cake, generally some sort of Biscuit at the bottom topped with marshmallow and covered in chocolate with toppings
" it tastes epic if you eat it without someone telling you it's a cake "
In Brazil this is called "Black woman tits" (Teta de Nega)  I wish I were, but I'm not kidding kkkkkjjjkj
It is a teacake in the UK...so technically it IS a cake...
They are good Marshmello teacakes. They sometimes have jam in them and there so good
I knew what it was the moment I saw it. Here in Brazil we call them... uh... "nigga's titty" (teta de nega). No, I'm not even kidding.
It's a fancy tea cake
Omgggg you came to manchesterrr wowww I mean that is disappointing but I hope u had a better experience the rest of the time xx
Omg Manchester!!
Damn I love these. I think cake can be a very general term describing sweets that resemble the shape of a traditional cake
It’s a tea cake lol
I live in the UK and I'd call this a cake, probably because we're weird like that
Bro it's raas IL abed in my country
It's called "Krem-bo" in Israel which means "cream inside" and it  is one of the most popular treats. I can see why you were disappointed, but for me watching you eating this was mouth watering.. 😄
It is a tea cake u americano
Its like when I first discovered Pavlova. They told me it was cake. I was disappointed that it didn't taste like any cake I ever tasted coz I was craving a fluffly creamed cake at that time. My sister and I had an argument about it too. The disagreement about when she ate Sansrival the first time. Now I just accept that cake means different in someone elses country.
Negga küsschen
I had them… they weren’t called cakes 3 years ago
Oh god, I got some of these when I went to the German market in Birmingham. I was so disappointed and mad
It's a tea cake!
I would love it if it was a Scottish snowball. They are delicious.
That's a flødebolle
I see everyone mentioning the name of this in their native language, but I'm Hungarian, so I'm going to pass.
Theyre very popular here in Denmark! We call them Creambuns (flødeboller) despite the filling being made of egg, not cream
Omg Janelle was in my city 🥳🤩 I hope you enjoyed your time at the Christmas markets x
Millenian problems
Why are you in Manchester 😅?
That is a Dutch treat and it's named negen zoen (nine kiss
In denmark we call them “flødebolle” and is Common to eat at birthdays 😂
as a German i knew exactly what there were lmaoo also fun fact: we used to call these "n-word kisses". yup.
In Poland we call it "ciepłe lody" which means "warm ice cream"
This is called ras alabd in Arabic راس العبد
the cake is a lie- Yup I've heard this before *Minecraft*✨
In Britain thats a tea cake
In Norway we call's it kokosboller =coconut buns.
These are popular in Sweden too, they're not cakes though. If compared to something they usually fall more under the "cookie department" rather than cake. It's not marshmallows in the middle, but an egg white mixture.
We get these in germany and austria!
I had the same experience when i first tried it!  If i remember well, the white stuff is egg white
I would’ve gagged if I bit into a dollop of marshmallow fluff lmfao props to you for keeping your cool
It’s called a “krambo” and it’s not a cake. It’s an Israeli thing… u can look it up (even tho it a WAY fancier Version)
They’re everywhere in Europe, and go by different names. Definitely not a cake though.
That's a fancy S'more, not a cake. If i wanted a S'more this looks amazing. But if i wanted cake I would have been aggravated too!
In israel its calld a "krembo" like cream in it. great alternative for ice cream in the winter
That is called Ricardito in Uruguay, it costs about a dollar and are really popular.
The first time i see it i knew it was marshmallow aftwr u showed the waffle and i thought it was a cake too:(
It’s a popular desert in Israel.. we pronounce it as “ krembow”
ENGLAND
Here they are called teacakes and some people call them cakes make sure you dont get fooled!
Now I'm not saying you need to apologise I'm just making you aware. In my country it is considered a cake
Excuse you I'm from a country where this is considered a cake so please. You talk about you not wanting to talk about other people's cultures negatively, so do your research before you talk about people's food like this. Because of where I'm from this is a highly loved desserts. I love your videos but please don't act like this
We have these in Palestine we call it “ras alabd “ (it’s in Arabic ) I usually only eat the cookie part when I saw this I immediately thought of it
For me that's a "Monte belo", but I haven't seen those with a waffle base. But it is for sure disappointing 😂😭😭
Their called tea cakes or walnut whips
In the Netherlands, and I saw also in Germany, it’s a chocolate kiss! (Just for information purposes, it used to be n-word kiss here.. yeah..)  it’s really good and comes in white, dark and milk chocolate 😊
In Denmark they are called cream buns lol
In hungary its called a n... kiss
Try tunnocks tea cakes or their caramel logs!!!!! Idk if you can only get them in scotland, but i think they are available in England too!!!
It’s merengue covered in chocolate, personally I love it. Maybe next time ask what the ingredients are, you’re a tourist and you’re not forced to know everything
People nowadays be like putting chocolate and call it cake 😅
In Israel we cal those Crembos. Super popular here, but no one claims to sell them as cakes 🤷
Makes sense.  Cookies are called biscuits across the pond. Puddings are generally steamed baked spongey masses various stuff, both sweet and savory.    A car trunk is a boot, a wrench a spanner. Tomato, to-mah-toe. Great experience!  🤷
It's a Schaum Kuss
We got these in USA too they are an old "candy" cookie thing called "Marmellos". Some commercial whipped fluff on a hard ass cookie covered in "chocolate". I ate em non stop for a week as a teen and got over em. Disgusting things.
I don't Ike the Marshmallows either.
Fuck that  That place blows!!!
In Peeu we call it "beso de mosa" it's really popular in birthdays
These things are called "chocolate kisses" in Europe! (I'm a finnish person myself) and those things doesn't contain your "marshmallow fluff" lol.
Maybe try looking stuff up before you eat it. This makes me mad. Never call a chocolate kiss a disappointment. Ever.

Some cakes don't have actual cake in them just so you know. In case you were living under a rock.
It’s a tea cake
Honestly in my opinion chocolate kisses are better than most of the cakes I've tasted in my life😂    but there are some exceptions ofc
Now I am craving some chocolate kisses😭❤❤❤
Its a "flødebolle" in Denmark
I call them crembos and I used to love them a a kid! Yummm
Omg we eat this in the Middle East
Ask what it is before buying
We call them Zoenen (Kisses). Not a big fan.
I live in Denmark 🇩🇰 and we call it a “flødebolle”
They may have invented the language, but their English is way different from ours…
I read the definition all the time when someone says cake…. Has to have flour or equivalent to to be a cake
That’s the menchester version of israeli krembo… it’s a candy for the winter… and in israel it doesn’t mean a mini cake😅 it really is a type of marshmallow fluff thingy
In Israel we call it “cream-in-him”
Whatever it is, it looks sweet and even if I was expecting a cake as long as its sweet sign me up
We call those chocolate kisses here in Finland! They used to be called n-word kisses but that was obviously really racist and the name was changed. They taste pretty good in my opinion. They’re really sweet tho so you can only eat one at a time.
GlaD0S: Yes
It's not a lie in Germany it is called a kinda a cake.
Its my favorite childhood sweet-
It's a mallowpuff
Interesting confection. Personally, I do not like marshmallow, mirage or white chocolate. Often these items are full of sweeteners without any texture to cut that sweet.
Those are like English tea cakes. I love them! But I can see how you’d be disappointed. “Cakes” are different in different parts of the world.
Pretty much everything GLADOS said was a lie.  There was never cake, there's NEVER cake!  It was all bait to play her stupid puzzles and complete the tests.
Its flødebolle
First world problems 🤦🏻‍♂️
u must be a new age kid....becuase i knew what that was instantly....grow up.
Omg i miss those sooooo much!!! I too wouldnt call it a cake but damn they are good!
You're on the trending! Yeah!!
That’s a traditional tea cake
Tea cakes! Lol.
It's a creambo!!!!!! How dare you talk badly of it 🥺
Look at the quantity!!! Those buggers have a 12 week shelf life. Yuk.
In my country we call them Ricarditos.
fun fact: back in the day we used to call them Morenkopf  in Germany/ Switzerland  but they changed it to Schokoküsschen because it was racist.  Morenkopf is a other word for N-word head
i never purchased these whenever they are selling during christmas market time. it is overpriced for the item. haha
You could say this cake was not a triumph, delicious, or moist.
Looks like a fancy Tunnock's Tea Cake which is a biscuit base, and mallow (wiki says it's Italian meringue) dome and covered with a layer of chocolate. I love them 😋😋
Is she offending our beloved winter ice creams??????😒😡😡😡😡
This is called winter's ice cream in Iran(yes weird name😂).
It'll not be a dissapointment for me, when I'm not really a fan of cake but sure as hell loves marshmallow. It'll be a nice surprise lol
You’ll probably find yourself feeling disappointed with more cuisine in the UK.
oh wait I know the person who runs this, I've had these before especially the dark chocolate ones, they are teacakes which can be marshmallow with a biscuit or waffle bottom and a flavoured and decorated chocolate, this business goes to all the Christmas markets in england they're pretty good if you like marshmallows
In South Africa those are called Cutie pies or Sweetie pies 😂
Schaumküsse, foam kisses. I can relate to that disappointment, they're overly sweet and impression less.
oh my god THE MEMORIES
Looks like a fancy toasted teacake
I think it kinda looks like Brazo de Mercedes cake in Filipino, the inside… I think it looks good!
Look as a british person who used to religeously go to the manchester christmas market, how dare you insult these guys
Oh my God I took a trip to the markets for the first time at the exact same time as you!!!!
It is not a chocolate cake it is chocolate teacake🤣
They have those in Germany also and I love them!!!! They shouldn't be described as a cake but it does taste good:)
why is this trending ? wtf...
I Israel we call them "krembo" ( cream filled ) and they are sold as winter ice cream
The cake is a lie
We call these "winter ice cream " in my country for some reason
As someone who had these at every childrens birthday, it is so fun to see someone not knowing what "chocolate kisses" are. They are indeed - not cakes - Don't know how they got their names
Its  swedish thing..
We have those in Finland and we call it a kiss
Drinking Starbucks coffee… abroad!? Minus 100,000 likes. Abroad makes it so much worse than it already is
I don't like marshmallow either. Dang. That sucks...
In the french-speaking part of Switzerland,   we call that a “tête de choco “ (chocolate head) and it’s a common sweet snack. It not Mashmallow in the middle but egg whites and sugar. :)
U r so cute when u 1st say this not a cake 😂
Other places call what we know as cake or pudding something else.
We call this راص العبد "rasil aabed" in Lebanon and I'm not sure where it's origin but my family and I are OPSSESED with it very popular in lebanon itself. The older ones had a yummy cracker instead of a wafer 😭idk why they changed it cuz those were so much better
As someone who had these at every childrens birthday, it is so fun to see someone not knowing what "chocolate kisses" are. They are indeed - not cakes - Don't know how they got their names
I know this as a “krembo”
It's not a cake it's a teacake 😂😂. Biscuit, marshmallow fluff and chocolate. Your face was priceless lol
Its called Gragbower Küsse in Germany
Sad its not a cake. But on the other hand, it looks so good to try!
White people food is disappointing to racist
Stroopwaffle
Another reason why England sucks!
I'm from near Manchester I dont like these things but they always sell them in Dec
Jeanelle is so beautiful omg she is so pretty
This is what happens when you don’t research other countries customs and foods. Ignorance is bliss I guess. What some people call biscuits we call cookies and so forth. Some people shouldn’t be able to travel or reproduce! Smh
As soon as you said cake I knew you were not going to be happy.
Its not a lie, you call these cakes in Europe, idk about other places of the world. I grow up with these, wasn’t disappointed
They are called mums mums in Sweden and we eat it for fika all the time
It's called bullshit in urban America ...
There's some great restaurants round there
You should come to Bournemouth. You'll like it
Cake can be called many different things in many different regions. Some call bread rolls, cobs and cakes, others call waffles cakes. It’s totally different dependent on the area.
That's a sweetie pie in South Africa 😂😂
cry
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates_🎈
What even is that???
I love this I always buy this but seriously who sells them and says they are 🎂
In Germany we call them "Dickman" (the brand), chocolate kiss or (if you meet a little older people) "Negerkuss" (it's a little racist so I won't translate it). It's pretty good, but it isn't a cake. I have no clue why someone would sell that as cakes.
they're called "bombocas" in portuguese and I don't personaly like it that much but a lot of people love it because of the nostalgia
It’s a cake, like a cake of soap. A block of compacted or congealed matter.
Hehe the cake is a lie guys
The definitions of words are different when you go to a different country you goofy!
It's technically a TEACAKE!!!! Originally from Germany :) personally I think they're delicious
Oh, yet another video of you slagging off England...AGAIN! Hope you don't bother coming back as you have said nothing good about it yet!🤬
the Hebrew name is much less misleading, it's called Krembo, literally meaning a cream inside it lol
We have something like that in Lebanon, it’s a brand called tarboush and it’s so good
Jeanelle!!! If you’re going Manchester I suggest heading to chinatown and going to the bakery there! They have pandan and ube buns and cake rolls
Those are what used to be called Mohrenkopf (moors or black persons head), don’t know if they changed the name (it's kind of racist) or not, but it used to be a favorite when I lived in Frankfurt. Also faves were kurtoffel cakes (crisp potato) with caramelized onions, roasted chestnuts served in a paper cane and white gluhwein (delicate hot white wine with lemon peel), delicious!
I don't think it's a lie, I think it's a teacake
Actually I love this thing I don’t even know what to name it isn’t a cake or a marshmallow fluff but like cream or something? I can get u got disappointed bec u probably don’t know it haha but it’s fine it’s really tasty though for some reason
we have this too in palestine (tbh i think most countries have it) its so good especially in winter 🥺
the fact i didn’t see you😓😓😓
im surprised you didn't recognise the shape of a chocolate kiss. Do you not have them outside of Europe? :o
In Poland is called warm ice-cream
Welcome to the uk!! Those are called Teacakes, thats probably why you got confuseddd
we call those puffs Sustancias here in Chile
That's a fucking Schwedenbombe. Calling it a "Luxury chocolate cake" is a stretch.
Time to update your definition of cake.
It's a cake
I have to say, this is one of my favorite desserts, but I've NEVER SEEN it described as cake. In Brazil it's called dinda or nhá benta
You know what disappointing is when your dating an asian girl and she doesn’t give you a fortune cookie after your done slaying her egg roll
I’m from Manchester 💕💕
In Portugal that’s called a bomboca, it’s not a cake it’s a sweet
That thing is just a mutant waffle Moonpie; Moonpie's are terrible.
They are called chocolate-coated kisses in Europe.
We call that "winter icecream" its not cold soo thats why its called winter icecream
We call them Montebello/Nhá Benta in Portuguese, it's my favorite candy, but we don't put a waffle in the end. It's absolutely delicious but not a cake haha
In Poland what you ate we call "warm ice-cream" 😂
it's called a teacake afaik, don't ask me why I'm as confused as you are and I'm british
Were the stall owners Slavic by any chance? Cause in Russia and Belarus pretty much anything sweet can be called cake as long as it's not pie. 😂
I love how everyone here tells about the name of those in their mothertounge and I think it's a great idea.
Dude c'mon it doesn't even look like it would be a normal cake lol
They’re called mellow cakes, don’t ask what they are in Belgium tho cuz we have a real racist word for those…
in dutch that used to be called an “n-word kiss” 😳…
Mohrenkopf! I had those in Germany. They are truly a disappointment,  even after you know what it is
In Poland it's called warm ice cream 😁
Omg I would've definitely gotten the amaretto one
Teacakes yum
I'm disappointed for you
I don’t think it’s cool that u showed their shop and called them out like that. Their products look amazing.
We call them tea cakes but I guess that is kinda wierd because they really aren't cakes lol
This is bomboca in 🇵🇹! (choco bomb)
DISLIKE
Is no one else gonna talk abt the reference lol? "the cake is a lie"
When you're outside your own country 10/10 some food that you've come to expect a certain way, will be different.
We have something like this in Poland and this is called "ciepłe lody", in English it's 'hot ice cream". I don't really like them, but my dad loves them and they remind him of his childhood.
Ooo we have stuff like this in Argentina, except it comes completely packaged and it's called Ricardito. So good, unless you were expecting actual cake like you were, then it's disappointing :')
Yeah, they‘ve caused allot of drama in Switzerland because of their racist name some called them here
This is a german sweet treat calld Schokokuss. Definetly not a cake! The only thing baked is the waffel😅
Honestly this is why I wait to see what people get and also when they eat it so I don’t waste money. But you can also ask if they have a sample or what’s in it and it’ll save you troubles.
We call it winter ice cream in iran cause you can’t eat ice cream in winter cause it’s cold but you can have these winter ice creams or (Bastani zemestooni)
You should have asked for the Pudding and then they would have given you a cake.  $hit is diffrent over there?
We call them SweetiePies.
Topkusse I miss those they r delicious
this is called "Teta de nega" in Brazil. the translation is basically "Black woman tittie" lmao
I would die happy if I get to eat like ten of those
I saw the pic and was like oh a marshmallow! I do understand the disappointment especially when expecting a cake.
if you transliterate it it's Slave's Head here in arabia or something similar to that
They look like big fancy mallomars which is a type of cookie me and my dad would stop and get before we went up to Canada for elk hunting
We call them "Beso de moza" here in Peru and they're absolutely delicious. That if you are not expecting cake whe  you take a bite 😅
هذا اسمه راس العبد
I love these I could eat hundreads of them
Everyone is talking about these sweet names in their languages, in hungarian it's literally called "[n-word] kiss". I am not being offensive and not joking, it is called "Négercsók" officially or unofficially, but it is the most widely used name for it. (And also "néger" isn't nearly as offensive in hungarian as it is in english for example)
It is a cake but it's a Ferrero TEA cake
This is called hot ice cream in Poland, u can buy them in a packet ^^
maybe it's a german food and they use the word for cake differently
We call it a warm ice-cream in Poland 🇵🇱
I like marshmallows but I would've totally been disappointed if I bought this expecting and craving cake. 😆
In Poland these sweets are called warm ice cream. Too sweet for me tho
Because it is not a cake at ALL. I don’t know if it originated in Germany, but we eat it here. I repeat: This is NOT a cake but still delicious
Those are schokokusse, and I think in the UK they are tea cakes. (There are other definitions of “cake” btw but I totally understand the disappointment LOL)
it’s a tea cake
In Peru it's called "Beso de Moza" and it's a chocolate filled with whisked and creamy whites of the egg with a chocolate cookies at the bottom
I love these it’s called creambuns in Denmark
Those are teacakes. You got exactly what was advertised??
We call these " Winter ice cream " in my country 😂
Looks delicious to me
In Israel it's rather popular during winter, though its name is not even close to "cake". They call it "krembo", meaning "crème in it". Both are not accurate at all in my opinion and the more accurate name is "chocolate-coated marshmallow treats" but I understand why they didn't call it that😅.  Apparently it originated in Denmark and there are many national varieties changing the biscuits/waffles, marshmallow-like filling, and the chocolate coating. So in a way the Israeli one is actually kind of more accurate to be called krembo.  Edit: it's so interesting seeing the comments calling the treat in so many names!😂
When you are german and already know what it is 😂
Normally in Denmark, insted of cakes, we give these out and they are called flødeboller. ONLY IF YOU ARE BROKE. But there are different types of flavour for the filling. :)
That would be a tea cake. A unique tea cake at that
But the way u said Manchester tho….
Tbh i get it can be misleading just like when i got offered a biscuit with my food in florida without knowing that theyre biscuits aren't what we call them in england and biscuits mean cookies in england
Meu Deus eu AMOOOOO
nooooo, teacakes are so good :(
Those are the bestttt everrrr Chocolate kisses are the life and so nostalgic for Europeans
It's called a sweetie pie in South Africa
We call them chocolate kisses in the Netherlands. The previous name was racist so we changed it
That is a tea cake these normally have marshmallow stuff in
I got these at Exeter Christmas Market and I thought they were normal marshmallow! I was really annoyed 'cause me and my friend got 2 each in the same bag and they all squished together into a fluffy mess😭
In South Africa we call those sweetie pies / cutie pies
Oh we have those in america latina. It's not a cake for sure, it's more like a treat. It's usually filled with fluffy marshmallow and it's quite yummy.
We call those where I dried ice cream and its usually eaten around November and it's definitely not the cake category
Teacakes!
ah I’m from Manchester I’ve grown to expect that kind of thing now- yeah that’s just how it works there sometimes it’s disappointing but I’m sure it would still taste good to me!!
That’s exactly how I think of ice cream cakes. It’s when they make them with only ice cream and no cake and call it a cake. Sorry but that’s not cake that’s a block of ice cream i just bought.
Oh, that's a sweety pie 😂. They are amazing 🤤
Thats a mums mums
They're tea cakes 😭😭
It technically is a cake bc it's called a teacake
Even if you didn't like them you don't have to be so rude about it. They are a really special treat in some cultures. The people in the stalls are usually really nice and will educate you on what's inside if you ask...
That's what I call a schwedenbombe
They are tea cakes. It’s a brand which is usually biscuits (cookie) with marshmallow fluff and covered in chocolate. I’m sad that they just referred to it as a cake
Why didn't you ask what's inside?  Sorry you were disappointed.
That’s an English tea cake, you should try the marks and Spencer’s salted caramel tea cakes 😍😍😍
It's even better than I thought!
It’s a teacake
Yeah that doesn’t say cake to me either.
This is a traditional desert called creambun in denmark
These is very common in Sweden.
We have these in Lebanon and it’s been part of our heritage for like 50 years now
I recently went there. The best things you can get at the market in Manchester is the hot dogs, one of the cookie sandwiches, the massive muffins or the fudge. They're all good. The hot dog is mainly because you can smell it all the way around. And its called a cake since its a tea cake. Like Tunnocks Tea Cakes
Did they call it a cake or a tea cake? Because that's a tea cake lol, different to a cake (obviously)
This called "winter ice cream" in Iran.
Haha in South Africa it’s called a “sweetie pie”  definitely not gonna help with a cake craving.
Those "cakes" in Denmark are typically eaten as a cake for dessert, and is especially eaten on kids birthday in school. It is taken along as a treat for the celebration of that child for the class to enjoy because it is an easy treat to take with you. The typical flavours at such event are coconut, and plain choclate. It is a waffer/waffel at the bottom with and marshmallow filling made of sugar and eggwhites, sometimes there  are flavours put in there but typically not, i recommend the fresher ones with strawberry or something else that is a little sour. In Denmark we typically get those from the firm "Spangsberg" that also make other kinds of sweets. I dont know where they are from but I hoped it was a help regards to the meaning of the so callede "cake".
In Poland these are called "hot icecream"
You're very good at looping these vids
.. called a tea cake luv 😂
The cake is a lie.
It’s called “warm ice cream” (ciepłe lody) in Poland. I don’t like them ether, its weird
Those are sold in Finland as well, mostly by Brunberg. They're called kisses here as well - but no sane person calls them cakes. They're candy lol
That’s a fluff not a cake
For those of you that said it was chocolate kiss or something like that no.. It’s called crembo and the crembo is marketed in Israel as a substitute for ice cream because it is not melted at room temperature. 🖤 it is easy to market and pleasant to eat in the winter months, when, to the taste of many: "the ice cream is too cold." 💜
Ik this u can buy it in the store. And it's SOOO good.
In Brazil is called "teta de nega" It's translated to something like "black woman's boob"
It is a German treat. It’s a marshmallow with a waffer on the bottom and it is covered in chocolate. I love them and I used to eat them all the time when I was in Germany.
omg I live in Manchester
קרמבו!!
So sorry😇 I personally love these. In Austria they are called swedish bombs.
How long are you in Manchester for I really want to meet you 🥺🥺🥺
In Israel you call It crembo  and there is the chocolate coating and also a mocha (the mocha one is gross) but the regular marshmallow fluff is Super tasty  And instead the waffle there is a soft cookie
Jeanelle is Cakngry...!😂😂
It’s a melocake
Remember guys that cake in Europe are not what America considers cake. These are very common in Eastern Europe too. I honestly like these more than American cake.
Tea cakes are different....and I love them it's a British thing my dear....it's not a lie ...it's a miss communication
Oh my god this is such a common treat here that It kind of endearing seeing someone who doesn’t know it!!! But to be fair, couldn’t you tell from the weight that it wasn’t a “cake”?
I would be sad too. Those "cakes" look amazing! And who the hell doesn't love cake! I am not a big fan of marshmallows anymore ..they too sweet
FLØDEBOLLER!!!!!!!!!!
Tea cake >.<
In Hebrew it's called- Krembo (קרמבו) and it is very popular. I love it!
Thos things are  called  zoenen in Dutch its usually in a pack of like 20 or something and back in the day we would give them out at birthdays at school to treat your classmates not anymore tho .they are soo cheap but kind of addictive
The thing is it's popular in Germany during carnival (at least in elementary schools and kindergartens) were you fight against each other to eat it as fast as you can. Back than it had a rather racist name but nowadays it's more known as "Schaumkuss" or "Dickmann". It's also sold on regular times so it aint just a one in a time treat
i also don’t like marshmallows :( mostly because i avoid gelatin, so i would’ve been pretty peeved
..they’re teacakes here in the uk but because of their shape, it’s clear to see what they are if you know so it’s often shortened to just ‘cake’. Get what you mean though 😅
They are called teacakes here. Not a lie.
Welcome to Britain lol
That is so misleading omg, and im sure they were expensive too!
In poland we call it a warm ice cream
I loved these so much as a kid!!
I’ve found that these stalls are often disappointing unless it’s crepes or hot chocolate or something really basic
This is a krembo very popular food in Israel
Aren't these tea cakes? They're meant to accompany tea, they are often a soft-ish biscuit with 'marshmallow fluff' coated in chocolate
In Germany we call them "Schaumkuss" which translates to fluffy kiss. Because you look like you kiss the sweet when you take a bite.
Ah, yeah, that's a teacake
that is like the textbook definition of a teacake
Okay it's "dissapointing" coming from you who often makes videos with background stories of how white people made fun of your "phillipino heritage" but here you are badmouthing other peoples' culture. Not cool. Sorry not sorry.
Love these! Big thing in the Netherlands for sure
in Poland we call then "ciepłe lody" which literally translates to warm ice cream
Grüße aus Deutschland: das ist ein Schokokuss 🤣
ITS A TEA CAKEEEEEE LOL
In the uk  these are called tea cakes.
Its not a cake
Oh no honey you should have got a cherry bag from the Dutch bakery - if they were there - I’m Mancunian (native Manchester girl) and those are fricken delicious- it’s like a folded donut a bit beignet like filled with cherry and  - sooo good!
You have to remember, our definition of cake, and England's definitions are often TOTALLY different!!
I was ready to say "Yup! I knew it. It's a candle!"
In Poland they’re called something allong the lines of „hot ice cream” you can get them in bakeries but also in supermarkets
Looks like Lebanese tarbouch to me We buy them as candies
I feel like that would've been delicious if you stuck in your hot cocoa😋🥰 I can never seem to get my cocoa quite froathy and smooth enough. A couple of those would probably do the trick🍫☕😋Merry Christmas🎅🎄
As children in Poland we called it “cieple lody” which means warm ice cream. Sometimes the waffle was in the shape of a cone. We loved it  so much! I can’t believe you’re disappointed!
In norway it’s called a coconut ball
Its from my Country germany its basically cream with a waffle and chocolate hahahah
YOU WERE IN MANCHESTER???? man i wish i was out 😭
In Mexico we got something similar to that but smaller, are called "bombonetes". By the look I would expected them to be similar but if the word "cake" it's involved then I would be extremely disappointed too.
We Have something like That in Sweden We call it Mums mums(yum yum) or skumboll (foam ball)
OMG. this is one of my favorite snacks, in Israel we call this קרמבו=krembo and it's sold only in the winter it is so good and it makes me (at least) feel kinda cozy
it's a tea cake
in norway we usually call these “kokosbolle” (coconut pastry/sweet). they’re filled with merengue, dipped in chocolate and sometimes rolled in coconut flakes which gives them their name. not a cake, not supposed to be a cake and not really disguised as a cake
The Manchester market is so busy this year and there are so many stalls everywhere.
We have it in Paris too and it's marketed as a chocolate mousse ball !
That’s a teacake, namesake as it’s often eaten along with tea or as a small snack, you would usually buy them about half that size in a pack and honestly one of my favourite chocolate items beside from a Ferrero Roche (I don’t like chocolate generally)
This is a filling of eggs,yes raw egg whites whipped with sugar(and maybe a few sweet ingredients) places on top of a biscuit/waffle(in our country they serve it on biscuits) and ya here in Jordan it’s a treat for kids the try sell it in packs and there is no flavours to it all the same
It's called krem-bo in Isreal It's really good!! Here it a soft cookie instead of the waffle but the filling can have different kinds of marshmallow flavor like vanilla or mocha. Usually people prefer to eat it in Hanukkah instead of the usual fried donut.(that are usually very heavy in your stomach) Also sometimes it's on an ice cream cone and is them called "hot ice cream" (very deceiving)
i mean idk i am from germany and ist pretty common here so i wouldn’t have been surprised since we get it all around the year……idrk but i pretty much disagree on the marshmallow fluff part!marshmallow fluff is pretty disgusting. I do get the similarities but it tastes a whole lot worse in every way!!
We call these winter ice creams in my country I love them the moment I saw them in the video I was like thats not a cake 😂😂😂😂😂 And the reason we call them winter ice creams is because its like a worm ice cream not really 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
We call that a tea cake in the uk its normaly biscuet marshmallow and then cover in chocolate some have jam inside to
That is an English tea cake, it’s marshmallow and a cookie, sometimes with jam, coated in chocolate. I don’t know why it’s called cake, it just is.
It is a cake…….. A cake of marshmallow fluff
Here in poland we call those warm ice cream (ciepłe lody)
It's a ricardito! Aaahhhhhhhh my abuela always buy to me <3
In Israel we call that a krembo
This is what we bring to school when it's our birthday. It's called 'flødeboller' I don't know if you'd translate it to cream buns or foam buns. The foam is actually made from egg whites and sugar.
OOOO! A FLØDEBOLLE! Tasty but definetly not a cake, haha! I don't know why they would call a flødebolle "cake"
why are you in Manchester…..
That's a flødebolle...
Mmm it’s not a *cake* cake but it’s very similar to a Tunnock’s Teacake, it’s got a biscuit/waffle base with a marshmallow filling and chocolate dome🤷🏽‍♀️
There not a lie in England there called teacakes but often called cakes bc u meant to have them with tea
This is called a flødebolle "cream bun" in Denmark! I love them! But expecting a cake I understand it would be very disappointing
Not to mention you probably paid way more than it was really worth
It’s like a home made tunnocks tea cake Well it’s exactly like it...
Thats a swiss/german thing I believe. In switzerland it‘s calles Schokoküsse or Schoggi chöpfli (which means chocolate kiss or chocolate head). In switzerland they‘re actually tasty and I don‘t tast the resemblence to a marshmellow.  Fun fact: they used to have a rather rasist name (it wasn‘t when they were invented) and last year the main manufacturer changed all the names, to be more inclusive.
They’re called cream-buns in Denmark, and are very common here, especially at children’s birthday parties! My favourite kind is raspberry/liquorice w/ white chocolate :D
It’s called “skumbolle” in Sweden, still not a cake here but I personally love them
its teacake! teacake are marshmallow type stuff in chocolate with a biscuit base. sorry for the disappointment janelle
This is called "teta de nega" here in Brazil (at least were I live), it translates to "black women's tits" or something like that. I am not the best in translation but I do know that this food's name it's at the very least really contradictory. But we have to consider that Brazil has a whole culture about black people, and it's really different from American in the way we treat cultural diversity (mostly on the northern part of the country). If you have any doubts about what I said in this comment please ask and I will try to explain it.
It's not a cake that's what it is
We have them in Germany as candy. The are good on a brakfast roll and often eaten that way. Slice the roll in two pieces, place the "Dickmann" on one side,  squish the between the two pieces. 😊👍🏻
We call it : winter ice cream in iran and it's one of my most favourite desserts 😋😋
These are in Palestine, but the translation to English is so derogatory they had to change it on packaging a few years ago
You should try scones
In Poland we call them "warm ice cream" or at least we always called them that where I live
These are known as "Tea Cakes" here in Ireland, i think in England too, although the bottom is normally biscuit!
In my country we call them "warm ice-cream"
We call these קרמבו 'krembo' (meaning 'cream in it') in Israel and for some reason they're seasonal and they only sell them at winter
In Israel it called creambo they available only when the winter is about to start
We call loads of things over here cakes 😅😅  It’s a tea cake
Darn, I would have loved it. Yes, it's not a cake.
I absolutely love those! Where I’m from we usually have a lot of these in stores around Christmas time and my dad used to buy these every year around that time
They are all over europe. Anything that shape will never be a cake.
in Poland it is called hot ice cream!
This is called a flødebolle i Danmark and it is considered a cake❤️
It's a ras El aabed
That's a national treasure where i live </3
It’s a simple desert invented in Israel called Krembo (means cream inside)
In Uruguay we call them "Ricarditos" lol
I had these in Germany! Dickmann’s I think is the brand they had at grocery stores 😂
Looks great to me lady! A lot of people feel this way about those, fluffmallows & bean cakes. I prefer the cake, cake stuff but all those are good too. 😊  Hope you get to have more fun during your holidays!
In my country this is a cake!
They did not force you to buy it, it's your problem not us don't come here and talk s about thing you absolutely want and buy it.
In Portugal that's called a bonbon... (bombom)
That looks like “beso de mosa”translates sota like “maidens kiss” :v I’ve never seen it as a cake nor has it been described as a cake.
These used to be called "[n-word] kiss" in German, thankfully these days most people, except for some "It's always been called that!"-assholes, have caught on not to call them that anymore
Lol its a teacake
In South Africa those are called sweetie pies, ours aren't that big though
It’s called a “flødebolle” in Danish, kids usually hand them out on their birthday
Okkk though but it’s not our fault u didn’t understand the culture when coming over 😭 is it an American thing to blame the other country loool
In Jordan these are called “Ras Al ebad” ‏راس العبد at the bottom it’s a cracker a soft cracker inside is marshmallow fluff and it has a coating of chocolate
That's called a tea cake! They're popular in England to have with a cuppa tea
Americans in Europe are like: omg it's not like in America?!!
In Poland we call it "warm ice cream" no idea why...
Nhá benta!
I live in Manchester! Hopefully you tried the sausages sold at the Christmas Market food court
Hello I'm from Manchester too.  Try English breakfast it can be different everywhere for example the English breakfast is totally different in Liverpool. I think you should try if you still in Manchester.
In my country, these are called Tarboush. They so good but they're certainly not cake 😂😂😂😂
Hi thought I'd drop a quick like     In the UK these are called teacakes! Normally had with afternoon tea.    Source: Me, I'm English
In denmark it is call "flødebolle" . It is a Nice treat, but I wouldn't call it a cake.
This thing is every israellis childhood its called here a Krembo and instead of a waffle there is a bisquite
Oh! That is actually a brazillian treat called "teta-de-nega", this store needs to know it's food
Brasileiro com vergonha de falar como a gente chama isso pq os gringo tudo tem nome bonitinho kkkk e o nosso "teta de vaca"
Lol, you REALLY never heard of those???  You can buy them all year long in germany.
Karen in training
No many things have name as cake not only general cake we eat rice cakes also has cakes in name or milk cake etc
That’s a bomboca it’s not a fkn cake😂😂
These are called 'Skumboll' (foam ball lol) or more known as 'Mums-mums' (yum-yum) in Swedish. Very beloved fika!
Culture difference
They're called Besos de Mozza för some reason, you usually find them at any store or in packages at the supermarket
YES!! That was a disappointment for me too when I tried it. The waffer was old and very very chewy. 👎
That looks like chocomallows where there is a biscuit in the bottom of the marshmallow then coated by chocolate
False advert.
Tamtams?
it's lowkey funny to see people who don't really know this candy, and they really aren't cakes... Here in Brazil we call them "Teta de Nega" or "Nhá Benta" and they are delicious ✋😔
You put it in your coffee
We have them in Sweden aswell, and they have several different names, but they are most certainly NOT  cake! xD
In South Africa, it is known as a "sweetie pie"
I feel bad for those never having had these before. These are my whole childhood and i absolutely love them.
Those are teacakes! Absolute classics, my grandma used to buy them around Christmas time. I’ve got very fond memories of them
these are really popular here in Germany and I never understood why
*teacakes, not cakes in England
In Switzerland its called "Kiss". There used to be another word for it, but it got banned for the obvious racism that was attached to it.
They're teacakes! I think the advertising was misleading ngl

We've always called it "ciepłe lody" which means "warm ice cream" in English 😂 I remember being a kid and looking for them in every possible shop in my country (Poland).
THE REVIEWBRAH REFERENCE LOLLL
That is a snowball
I’m not going to say how their name is in Switzerland, it might be offensive. But I once tried them, I don’t like it, to sweet for my taste.
I thought this was related to portal   Lol
This gives me the same vibes as Americans ordering a "latte" in Italy and then complaining about being served a cup of milk.
In the Netherlands his candy was -very inappropriately - called ‘negro kiss’ although one of my favorite candies and in my child’s mind a compliment (no better kiss than these ones!!), they now -rightly so- changed the name to ‘super fatties’ 😅😂🤣😂🤣😂 i m still not sure if the second name is any better though 🤷🏽‍♀️😅😅
I love those things 😭
As someone who lives in Manchester - I personally wouldn't try it either way hahaha
Those are popular here in Sweden. But yea, they're not called cake, more like "foam tops" or at least includes "foam" because of the fluff😂❤ I love it but they shouldn't have told u it was a cake lmao
In the insider it is egg white wirth sugar ;) it is a german cany.
It's too round to look like a cake haha why didn't you ask the seller what's inside?
Its called a kokosbolle in Norway
It’s a British teacake 😂😂 not actual cake 😂😂😂
That’s a flødebolle in Denmark, it directly translates to creambun
I would've been happy af if it was marshmallow fluff
Hahaha it is a tea cake 😆
we in israel call it a crembo (which means cream in it) and have it on winter, its definitely not a cake but a delicious treat!
We have those in Denmark, and when I first tried one I was so disappointed😞
Say the germanic name
Brittish cakes are more than just the wikipedia definition
Looks like an expensive tunnocks tea cake. So gross lol, I recommend a wagon wheel
They're chocolate kisses.  I disliked them too as a kid, always dissapointing.
In Iran 🇮🇷 we call these winter ice cream and omg everyone here loves them and they remind us of our childhood

Yeah that's a teacake... Although I've only ever seen them with a soft biscuit at the bottom, not a wafer
Put the mohrenkopf in between a real crunchy bread bun (Brötchen) sooooo yummy!!! 🤤🤤🤤
I'm offended 😂 it's one of my favorite deserts
Looks like a type of sweet called a tea cake which isn't a cake but called one
I love thoseeeeee!
I’m in the uk and the moment I saw the chocolate marshmallow treat I knew exactly why you were disappointed. These are really common here at German Christmas markets.
Please tell me your still in manchesterr
Welcome to Manchester! But pls do try other Christmas stalls, especially the pork cracklings
This is an Israel treat called Krembo, it is usually better the simpler you make it. I hope you will get to eat the original version one time 😉
YOU WERE IN MANCHESTER,!!?? I COULDVE MET U
Those things are really popular in Germany. 😁
We callit "tarboosh " in lebanon because it looks like the trasitional lebansese hat with the same name, and it's sold in packs of 3 or 9 in partically alll stores even the tiny ones for barely any money😂😂😂
These are choco mallows
We call em chocolate snowballs in Australia
This is called "Ras El abed" in Syria we get these randomly when u come back from the souq or depends and it's not marshmallow fluff it's eggwhites with Suger I believe
That is a waffle not cake. U should go back and film the sign warning your many viewers. I like marshmallow fluff with peanut butter sandwich   Called a fluffernuter .  Have u had one? ❤️💕👍
Thought it was ice cream
Funfact: In Poland those are called "warm icecreams".
Its called a flødebolle in denmark, its a sweet to be eaten with warm choko or coffe
זה קרמבו יסתומה
I actually went to the market with my partner and bought these on Saturday. I really didn't like the chocolate orange because of the aftertaste. There was also a stall that sold things like real parmesan and parma ham. That was the best stall by far. I hope the rest of the day was good for you though 😊
It’s a tea cake.
You have to live it to know i guess.
Kinda look like Bieber balls
It’s a tea cake.
The cake is a lie iykyk
In Denmark we call them cream balls.
Seriously though, the cake is misleading but it looks delicious though, I am not complaining 😂😂😂
Called Negerkuss in Germany. Kids love them.
I'm South Africa we call it a sweetiepie~
In Portugal we call this a "bomboca"... I'm not a big fan...😬 I understand your disappointment.
Any swede would be able to tell ya this aint no cake, we call them gräddbullar which means cream buns.
i love the reviewbrah quote, i can't be the only one who actually watches him
Imagine letting that ruin your trip.
Definitions in UK are different! You are in the country of English language so keep quiet 🤫
The marshmallow like inside reminds me of pavlova cake, it's a cake we have down here in Oceania thatvusuallt served with whipped cream, fruits like strawberries and kiwifruit, bananas, etc.
Me, from the look if the item I could tell straight away what was inside it. I bet the guy didn't know how to describe it. And that's wafer, not waffle
In Perú is called beso de mosa
those are called sweetie pies in south africa!
These are call " ras al abd" in Arabic. It means a black man's head. I don't really like it personally
I'm ok with it but it should be renamed as a chocolate malomar
In Poland, we call it "ciepłe lody" (warm ice cream), and in our country, apart from that, it's sold in ordinary ice cream cones
Thats a crembo in Israel... DELICIOUS! But not a cake...
Europeans know exactly wht tht is… we find it everywhere and they r yummy
That kinda sucks
I know this, we call it Nha benta or teta de nega here in Brasil and it's definitely not a cake lajssoksso it's a lot more like a birthday party candy
I’m sad you don’t enjoy Mohrenkopf, but to each their own I guess.
It's called krembo in israel
These are tea cakes. In england a tea cake is usually a biscuit (or cookie as Americans call it I suppose) fluffy marshmallow and it’s covered in chocolate. I absolutely love these!! But I understand your disappointment lol
I love those things so much
Us danes are coming through in this comment section 👏
Nooo I wanted to u like but I just to like cuz I agree I'd be sad too
Those are "zoenen"
They sell those kind of candy in Uruguay! It's awesome 🤤
To be fair soon as i saw it i though marshmallows
That's not a cake, it's a common and popular snake in many places but I never heard anyone call it a cake. On the other hand, it is technically a cake based on the broader definition of the word cake which doesn't even need to be sweet nor contain flour.
Since I can't eat marshmallow fluff, I would've been MAD
Manchester is rubbish x
That has never been a cake its called flødebolle meaning cream bun its a wafle with marshmallow fluff and chocolate
isnt that those German dickmanns
craembo
Omg I love these. I would always get them whenever I’m in a Christmas market in Paris.
I live in Iran and we call these "winter ice creams". I used to eat them all the time as a kid. This is like a very nostalgic childhood snack.
We call these Krembo here in Israel.
I hate when places do this.   I want cake.
Ur supposed to dip it in the coffee
I actually much preffer these than cake...
I would’ve been pretty upset 🥲 They didnt have a picture of the inside is what I’m thinking
Your day was ruined? Wahhh
* *Re-plays Portal* *
These are amazing, definitely not cakes though.
Here in South Africa we call those sweetie pies and yeah I'm sorry you got tricked like that 😅🤭even though they're not cakes they're absolutely amazing 😁 🇿🇦 much love your way
Always ask what's inside? It IS a cake...
False Marketing.. should just be wrong..
hou should honestly come to london! i came up to london bridge from the outskirts of london and theres loooaads of food stalls along the river!
the inside looks like a FILIPINO BRAZO DE MERCEDES, i don't know but brazo de mercedes is treated as a cake in the Philippines.
FLØDEBOLLEEEEEE
I don't see a problem here, as someone who loves sweets, I'm completely fine with this
I would be so upset. I hate those marshmallow things I'd why I just don't like the texture, so if I got that instead of a cake I would actually start crying
In Brazil this candy is known as "teta de nega" (in English: breasts of a black woman, because it looks like the candy, but not in a racist way), it is very popular and loved by people, not only at christmas
I hate marshmallows so this would make me so uoset
That’s disappointing and I love marshmallows. That’s not a cake! That’s a marshmallow and waffle cone pop.
Never disrespect the flødebolle (creamball) ever by calling it a cake. It isnt a cake its a fluffy creamy mashmello waffle covered in chocolate. Every danish kid has tried them and most love em
Um.. for one Manchester, we do shit different here, such as "the" is "t" and secondly, where ya think ya English lingo comes from. And also you just said the definition of cake and you just ate the definition.
It’s not a cake cake….. that however is a tea cake with a waffle base instead of a biscuit base 😂
my cult: r: appear dissappear but everyone loves them t: a good friend and a pervert 👍👍👍 m: a mix of r and t
These are very common in Australia and England around Christmas. We consider them to be desserts.
a report of the week viewer fellow man of culture i see
You’re making me wanna buy stuff, but I am broke :,( they look so good
It's called a tea cake
It's a 'kokosbolle' in Norway! Super tasty & popular, but wouldn't define it as cake 🤔😚
They're very common-teacakes😂
YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO SMASH THEM INTO FACES!!!!!!!!!!!
lol as germans would call them, chocolate kisses. those aren’t cakes 😂 i grew up on those and always get them from my family in germany for christmas. they’re literally just like marshmallows, i’m surprised they’re selling them as “cakes”
Teacake
I can’t believe you don’t like marshmallow, this is heathenry
I wish that you were able to come & experience Scotland! Especially the beautiful highlands.
That would upset me. Food descriptions need to be accurate especially when you cannot see the inside. It's a pet peeve of mine when ingredients are not disclosed, too.
its actually not marshmallowfluf but whipped eggwhites :D
The cake is a lie, huh wonder were i've heard that from
its called Indian in Czech Republic and its not that bad, but its not a cake at all.
In Mexico we have these there called choclatines there same just smaller and ours has a chocolate cookie on the bottom
In Norway we call them "kokkosboller" aka coconut balls ^^
I don't like marshmallow either!
If my friend gave me this as a cake; we are no longer friends.
London is the best place to be a day after the Christmas 🎄..trust me ..u going to love it
Those are Tea Cakes, absolutely love them but i can understand the issue XD
It looks like 👍 👌 something 🤔 I would definitely enjoy 😉 😊.
We call them "Nhá benta" in Brazil. I've never seen someone refer to them as cakes before.
Tea cakes
The workers probably got lazy lol
Thats like a mallow puff that we have in New Zealand!, but it's more of a biscuit base for us! made by griffins..
Wow it really Kool  how  placed in the world have  a different name for the marshmallow surprise fluff
I got these exact things in Newcastle and was very disappointed when I realized they were just bought in and not hand made. Plus that much marshmallow is hard to finish
That looked delicious. But it was, indeed, not a cake.
is that a portal reference for the title?
I hope people see the portal reference in the title whether or not it was intentional. PORTAL YAY
as soon as i saw it i knew it wasnt a cake lmao idk how u didnt
Here in brazil this is called"nhá benta" that means "ms. Benta" Or "dinda" that means "godmother" Its really good  But definently not a cake We have easter eggs made of it <3
Shout out to Camden hells,you gotta try the pale and their white beer
In Poland this I called "warm icecream" which i find pretty funny
Same I don’t like marshmallow
They're teacakes 😁
Hey these are what we call tea cakes.
They're really popular in Sweden, but we call them "chocolate tops" or "cream buns". Of course they're not buns either but it still feels more logical than calling them cakes.
We call this coconut bun, they are soooo good. And no, its not a cake 😅
For the Latin Americans, this is a Beso de Moza 🤪 I’ve never heard it being called a “caked” before lol
I love marshmallow fluff. I'll love that.
In my country it's called a beso de moza
Looks like a gigantic Tunnocks tea cake, but they have a biscuit base not a waffle.
Btw, just realized that this dudes shop name is 'Köhler Küsse', it's what's written in pink above 'luxury chocolate cakes'. It either means 'kisses from a guy named Köhler' or 'kisses from a place named Köhler', I honestly don't know if there is a place named Köhler in Germany, but it could very well be that guy's last name 😅 Also, I hope you ask people before you film them and their shops🙏 I know the UK is techincally not Europe anymore, but culturally it is, so as a European let me tell you that most people in Europe might not like being filmed without giving their consent and I just really wouldn't want you to run into any legal issues👍
It's one of those things that just gets lost in translation
That's what we in the UK call a "teacake" so that's probably why you got confused because "cake" is in the name. :)
🤨😑😕I am not a fan of marshmellowie things. I like smores.  But I would be a little bummed too.
Ypu went to Europe. We don’t see some foods the same way as Americans?? Read about the history of the food you ate before saying things like that. For example to us pancakes aren't those fluffy things Americans eat. To us pancakes are flat.
Idk why they called it cake, it's a little weird, but I originally know this treat from Germany. We call it Schokokuss (chocolate kiss) and it's a treat we start eating as kids. If you grow up with it, it's really delicious, but since it's so sweet, if you eat it as an adult for the first time, it might be overwhelming. Jeanelle, just a friendly advice from someone who as moved from Germany to Japan (two completely different countries especially in terms of food), some things are just not what you are used to and what you know. You should really get used to being surprised like this or else you are just gonna end up disappointed most of the time. :)
Yeah the “cake” in “teacake” can perhaps be a bit misleading lol
She literally made an entire video calling them out this is great
Well, crab cakes aren't actually what your thoughts are what a cake is..maybe it was just their interpretation or translation of it.
My home city Manchester, I’ve had these before they’re so good 😍
Depending on where you live, you'd know what it is, also it's name deferres from place to place, in my country we call it "black man's head", no joke, which I find to sound racist and unappetising It's a popular type of candy here, it used to be my favourite snack as a kid
Flødeboller! It is a Danish (I think) dessert that was my FAV when I lived in Copenhagen! Sooooo good but definitely not a cake lol
Everything is cake except cake
don’t get it mixed up with oat cakes then you would be really caught off guard haha
Oh I call them snowballs I used to have them all the time
Here in Peru you can find it as “Beso de Moza” and it only costs 25 cents (US dollar) each, they’re pretty popular and sooo tasty!
It's very funny to see one of these and know EXACTLY what they are while you're being disappointed xD
I would have been okay with the surprise. The type and texture of a cake can vary depending on where in the world the recipe comes from. Your definition is from westerners idea of “cake”, which can also be called a bread in other parts of the world. If you decide you don’t care for it...well now you know. But don’t be disappointed,  just enjoy.
We have a biscuit like that here in the Philippines, If I can recall it properly, they call it as a munch mallows and definitely it was on the biscuits category. I would be also surprised if I were you.
We have stuff like that in the Philippines, idk what they're called tho
They are teacakes
Ok for one it's called a tea cake for a cup of tea and second thers a place in stonehaven I would recommend it's a ice-cream shout that's been there for a long time
In israel we call this a Crembo and let me tell you even cats get exited when they see these so I do not know what you’re complaining about
It’s a tea cake, not a cake
It's a tea cake
It's called "Bomboca" in Portugal and I really appreciate it. It's like a milk cream or even the white of the eggs with some sugar There are many flavours but most of them only come from the chocolate But some of them have flavour on the spume
This is my favorite food in the entire world. In Hebrew it’s called “cream-bo” and I am literally obsessed with it
It didn't really look like a cake, it looks like a marshmellow and must be super yummy!
In the netherlands its called negerzoen😬
thank you for the portal joke in the title. Much appreciation. The cake is a lie.
I’m Sweden we call them “mums-mums”.
They’re called tea cakes :)
Tell me your ignorant without telling me your ignorant: many things can be called the same thing but not be the same. You're at a different country it's obvious it's a different language and sometimes the translations are not exact.
It’s a teacake; they’re not actual cakes, but they are meant to be eaten with tea as a sweet treat. They come from English Tea Time. It may be a misleading name but they are delicious!
Thats a teacake lol
As soon as I saw the shape of it I knew that was a marshmallow. If you don't like marshmallow fluff doesn't try a tea cake that's small and in foil that's about the same thing.
Ok this is going to be shocking to some people, so please don't attack me, I'm just sharing info 😅  In Belgium these are nowadays known as "melo-cakes" or "mellowcakes" because it's the name Milka (the chocolate brand) gave to it. *BUT* back in the day, depending on which province you were from, these used to be commonly known as "negerzoen" or "negerinnentet". I'm so scared of translating this but here goes nothing: "negerzoen" literally translates to (I'm sorry I have to use the n-word here) "nigger's kiss" & "negerinnentet" translates to (again, I'm sorry) "nigger's boob".  They were also often called chocolate kisses or foam kisses.
I'm more surprised you didn't know what they were.
That’s weird I’ve only ever seen them called chocolate kisses
Nooooo they are the best
It's definitely not a cake. But I believe it’s called cake in the UK duo to a taxing rating. Saw a prog about it once. Apparently, cakes are taxed less than cookies and desserts. So by categorizing it as a cake, they will pay less for the tax. Same goes with Jaffa cakes.
In Denmark we call that a "flødebolle", before the name was changed it was called something really inappropriate and racist that about translates to "n-word kiss" which I'm glad it got changed.😥
Oh, they're Super Dickmanns! Whenever I go to my mom's town in Germany we would get a box. Definitely not cake though lol
Looks like a tea cake to me
At least it’s not soap
These are called tea cakes in the uk
Skumtoppar in swedish 😍👌🏼
"My day is ruin"  Really!!!
Here in Perú its called Beso de Moza
I’m from Scotland and these are called teacakes XD
It’s called „chocolate kiss“ in Germany. It’s amazing.
It's a tea cake
We call that a teacake in England. I really like it.
In Israel they're called Krembo (singular) and people love it! It's sold in winter cuz they melt in the extreme heat here lol I don't really like them but most of the people here adore them and only want winter to come because of them
They are called  Schokoküsse or Schaumküsse here in Germany. And honestly I love them. You can only eat them once all two month tho since their soo sweet. Also for younger kids at parties there would be competition on who could eat it the fastest without hands lol(they come in different sizes)
looks like a Peruvian beso de mosa!
In England, we call those ‘Teacakes’. I agree it’s a cruel and disappointing name
It’s a teacake. They’re a uk thing…
Well your first mistake was going to Manchester
I watch your vid’s i do enjoy, but this sounds kinda uncultured
Totally agree x total con
Oh. I get it. Yeah that's not a cake it looks like one but it's called راس العبد which in English is a black man's head. And it originates in Jordan. It's made from soft marshmallow fluff and chocolate coating with a biscuit.
I came here for a Portal joke
in austria we call them schwedenbomben !! :) they're sort of popular but I personally haven't eaten one in a while. I like them but they're not my go to or anything. but if you expected something else I definitely get why you'd be disappointed haha, I had that happen to me too as a kid
Yeah those are Teacakes lmao
Idk why they called those cakes, no one in their right mind would ever compare them with cakes? If you get good ones they are pretty good though! I remember eating a white chocolate lime one, it had some crunchy bits on top (can't remember what they were)
I went to one of their stalls, I liked it! :)
Those are tea cakes lol, they’re really good and sometimes are ate with jam too!
This called cream-bo in Israel, they only in markets in the winter time  The meaning of the name is "cream in it" 😍
I think going to Manchester is always a mistake 😂
I got these as a gift not long ago and I was so disappointed☹
Honestly I forgot these sweets existed, when you showed them I remembered instantly what they tasted like and the fact they are basically marshmallow fluff covered in chocolate and as a kid I loved them but as an adult they are sickly and I barely managed one before giving the rest I bought to my younger cousin who was ecstatic to receive more sweets~
hahaha the moment you said it disappointed you and i saw the treat i knew it would be a marshmallow! it looks good though, but man, cake is 1000000 times better
The deception!!!!!
Tea cakes normally have a biscuit base and not wafers. The biscuit base is wayyyyy better
You should really try ‘Cake Box’ CAKE. They sell the best cakes (also egg free) in the UK.
It’s called a tea cake here in the uk. Also ‘cake’ can mean pretty much anything here, so don’t always expect an actual cake
I can see the confusion because I’m from the uk and these are called ‘teacakes’ sorry that you were disappointed but they are still delicious 😋
That’s a tea cake
Literally going here tomorrow and planning to get this exact cake
It’s a tea cake 😭and u just disrespected tunnocks teacakes 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
in Israel it's called a krembo
The product description is wrong but these are a very common item in many European countries and will vary in the different countries. Just a cultural difference and unfortunate confusion. These are actually brilliant!
Man, thats a fancy tea cake
It’s a tea cake!
Should’ve asked what’s inside 🤪
So funny its a flødebolle a Danish treat- not a cake !! 😍😂 its made of egg whites and sugar and the waffle in the bottom dipped in chocolate the plain ones is with chocolate and coconut 😘
Krembo in hebrew.. translates to cream inside
i frickin love those things, i used to have them all the time as a kid and sometimes still get them
We have a similar candy in Argentina but is filled with dulce de leche, so much better! I also got disappointed when I went to other country and tried the marshmallow filled ones lol
If you ever get one with someone else you have to smack their hand while theyre biting it giving them “a kiss” as thats whAt we call them in most European countries. Its a fun snack lol 😆
We call them sweetie pies in South Africa
lmaoo it’s a teacake
my immediate reaction was "oh, a teacake"
Its krembo made from eggs and sugar
Danish flødeboller 🤭🤤🇩🇰
Marshmallow kisses
Oh I love these! Def not a cake, but really nice anyway 😂
they are called besos de moza in perú, they are definitely not cakes, but here they have a cookie at the bottom
That’s a one sided definition of cake
It's not a cake... it's a TEAcake- in the UK this is a very particular food item... please look things up in the UK, it's not the same as the US!!
Can't wait till Jeanelle finds out pudding isn't always pudding in the UK
American discovers tea cakes
In Brazil it's "Nhá Benta"
the cake is a lie the cake is a lie the cake is a lie the cake is a lie the cake is a lie the cake is a lie the cake is a lie the cake is a lie the cake is a lie
The one you had was a krembo but in England I am here cuas si live her we call them tea cake and they are slightly diffrent it is a marshmallow biscuit based chocolate covered snack they are typically a snack and we eat them at afternoon tea so tea cake but we classify them as biscuit
I guess I will follow the lead of my fellow Europeans. In Sweden these are called 'Gräddbullar', which translates to (Whipped)cream buns. But that is super misleading as they are not, in fact, buns stuffed with whipped cream. (It's sweetened egg whites, I think). I felt lied to the first time I had one too, but they are nice if you just want something to curb that craving for sweets.
Its not a cake lol, its a chocolate-coated marshmallow treats. We call it crembo in Israel, but yours looks like a fancy one! We just have plain ones.
Lol she got the teacakes
I grew up in Germany so I knew exactly what that was before you bit into it 😆
You missed the beauty of them by eating them wrong. You supposed to share with a friend and the moment their about to take i bite you smack it in their face. Now you can sit and eat your cake while looking at the crime you just committed against your friend.  The whole taste lays in the pain of the victim staring staring you down with sticky goo on their face :)
That’s like when the Yankees flock to the south and ask for iced tea, but send it back because it’s “too sweet” 😆❤️
It really popular not like the one you get
It is called a tea cake it is a biscuit or waffle with marshmallow
Teacake bro 😂😂
It's a chocate tea cake like to have with a cup of tea  like a tunics tea cake they are best thing ever get you head out your ass
It's like a giant mellow puff or something
This is called "teta de nega" in Brazil, it's barely above a bar snack in luxury factor though
Its the north  yeah
The danes over here ...
It’s a tea cake! 😂
“pretend you’re at a christmas market” me: what the heck is a christmas market?
Its like us uk going to US and asking for chips and getting a pack of crisps 😂
It’s a tea cake
It’s called a “Flødebolle” in Danish and they are definitely not in the cake category, so I get why you got disappointed. There is also other very delicious flavours,  sadly picked a normal pretty boring one
Flødebolle!
It's a teacake lol
It seems this "cake" has different names around the world, in Israel we call it Crembo
I never thought about the name but I love those things xD
It’s called a flødebolle in Denmark and is pretty popular lol but they should do better with the names…
Oeeh yes! Those are kisses, great when you expect it, not when you want cake :’)
These used to have a very controversial name here in Germany ...
Lit a tea cake grow up
It’s a tea cake
That is actually a cake in England we have things called tea cakes that are exactly that! So it isn’t a lie
These are called tea cakes here in the UK. I'm not the biggest fan of them but hey! It is a bit wierd that it was advertised as a cake though.
In Israel those are called krembo (translated to "cream in it"). aka "winter ice cream" because it only available during the winter, because in other seasons it's melts😝 There is even a youth movement named after this candy here!
It might be because it’s almost like a teacake, a marshmellow and biscuit dipped in chocolate.
Scandinavians knowing damn well this ain’t a cake 😭🌚 this is what you give people during birthdays in Denmark 🥰 and they are the best you can get
Those are my favorite omg! Their called crembo where I’m from originally :)
did you eat a tea cake?
As someone from the United Kingdom, this reminds me of a “Tunnocks Teacake”
I think that’s a tea cake
It's a teacake.
It’s a tea cake
This is called crembo in Hebrew, usually it has a biscuit on the bottom and it has a meringue on top and it’s all dipped in chocolate.  It’s usually seasonal and you can only buy it in winter ❄️ really reminds me of my childhood
In Denmark it’s called a flødebolle. It’s not a cake 👍🏼 It’s just another form of candy.
They're called "mums-mums" in Sweden (it means yum-yum) and they're not really popular. 😂
In Poland it's called warm ice-cream Fluffy, very sweet, cowered in chocolate... It's hard to call it anything else than dessert
They’re called tea cakes here in England
That's a teacake, the standard ones you can get in a supermarket will just have the chocolate coating over a biscuit base with jam and marshmallow, this just looks a little fancier. I love them personally
Called crembo where I live
I'm going to the Manchester Christmas Market some time soon, anyone have any other recommends of what to and what not to get? I also don't like marshmallow so thanks for this.
It used to be called a very offensive name where I live lmao but they’re so common in my country
They're not actually made out of marshmallow I tried them they might look and taste like marshmallow but it's actually not marshmallows we call it angel cake for some reason in Arabic even though they don't look nothing like an angel cake
OOF, we have those in Brazil, I actually LOVE them :D Where I come from we call them Merengues. I've never seen anyone call it a cake though!
In danish it’s called a whipped cream cake/ bun, it’s a kinda of festive cake, which is often eaten at party’s 😊
Okay, I'm Dutch and I absolutely love those, it's basically Zoen which means kiss in English. It's pretty cool to see there are different flavours cause I've only ever seen just chocolate covered one's. Hope you enjoyed your trip there tho
These are called Dickman. Or atleast its the name i know.
In Israel It's called Krembo (lit. "cream in it", I guess?) Never tasted a high-end version of it, so now I'm curious
This is a Schwedenbombe
You should go the seaside side city of Eastbouren or Pevensey where the amazing Sherlock Holmes was created because I would just love it if you came to my city.
I only like marshmallows in s'mores 😆
The cake is a lie😂
In norwegian they're called "kokosboller",  which translates to "coconut buns" because there are coconut sprinkles on the outside. They are pretty common here, so we don't tend to mix them up. Don't know why they are called buns though, probably the shape lmao
This is extremely(!!) common in Denmark as well!😅😅 Just from the shape, I could guess EXACTLY what it was gonna be.😅 Sorry you were disappointed.😓
It's a kiss! 😆
I'm with you, I hate marshmallow!
it’s a tea cake
This is a tea cake which is a creamy blend  Don’t get it confused with sponge cake lol
These are chocolate kisses not cakes. They are common in English Christmas markets.
in Brazil we also have that... the shape is very recognizable so I wouldn't confuse it with cake... I guess English people like to call a lot of random things cake
Flødeboller!! Those are a really big thing in Denmark. We tippacly eat them for birthdays :))
In Lebanon, we call that Tarboosh (admittedly it used to have a more racist name)
omg i live in manchester! it's not a cake but we call them tea cakes 😭😭
Eew!! I agree with you!! Those are not appetizing at all. I’d be so mad if I thought I was getting a cake and got a chocolate-covered marshmallow and wafer ball. Yuck.
Is that like a tea cake 😭
COME TO LEICESTER HIGH CROSS ❤ 😍
It's called a flødebolle (cream bun) where I come from. It has nothing to do with cake. The bottom is a thin wafer, while the filling is whipped egg white with sugar. I think in some English speaking countries it's called a sweetie pie.  I understand that you're hella disappointed, I would also be. It shouldn't be called a cake at all. Although it shouldn't be called a bun either, or cream fir that matter, but I guess we never thought if it, as what it is named, because we all know that they're not that, and something else. But I see why it's misleading to tourists, especially if you're in my country, and use a translating app.
If it is what I think it is then we call it 'cold ice cream' in my country
It’s actually a tea cake
I always get churros when I go to the markets and they are the only and best desert I have😍
Babe it's a teacake
Here in Britain we call those tea cakes :)
Thats not cake  But i love them its something we have in germany
I know these, we have a package of a 20 and their pretty good
That’s a traditional European dessert and I love it.
In South Africa we called it choco pie
This is called a tea cake in Britain!
In Denmark its called a "flødebolle" i wouldnt describe it as a cake more like a sweet marshmellow cream with a variety of chocolate on the outside ❤️
Those are teacakes😂😂
Yh they’re called tea cakes in England, but can see the confusion if you’re not from here lol
That’s a chocolate tea cake. It’s different and weird. Not to be confused with a normal toasted tea cake or a hot cross bun. It’s a British thing …
Its calles krembo in hebrew and its very populer not only on christams sense we dont celebrate it here
Looks like the German version of something we call tea cakes in the UK. However, as its not described properly on the stall, I would have bought that thinking it was a proper cake too 😔
Chocolate mallow biscuit, or as we call it in Denmark, flødebolle. Looks good, but it's not a cake! xD
It’s a teacake! One of my faves 🤤
This called a “Flødebolle” in denmark they are pretty good but the most used flavors are coconut and rasberry
We have those Boxes sold in Finland. Its called suukko and it means Kiss but it was called n-word Kiss Back in The 80s..
The lack of portal references in the comments disappoint me more than this "cake".
These are very normal and regularly consumed where I live but yeah calling them cake could be a bit misleading
That’s the worst thing in the world they look good taste Awful 🤢 for me is always a no no
They’re tea cakes
I got cakes like this when I was in the UK. Tea-cakes too 😹. I think it's something that gets lost in translation between countries. Maybe like... "chips"?
They sell these in my local mall along with macarons! I’ve never had them cause I can’t eat marshmallows but they look good! I’m sorry you got falsely advertised tho :((
In Germany they are quite common and when I saw these in the video i immediately recognized them. Truthfully, they are not cakes but I think Schokoküsse (chocolate kisses) are still good
זב קרמבו
At least the ant liked it
We have this treat in Iran, it’s called winter ice cream because it looks like ice cream but it doesn’t serve cold, so it’s good for kids to eat these in winter, and not feel cold or getting a cold.
I feel you..
We have a thing in Australia called snowballs they're chocolate with marshmallow inside and normally shaved coconut. If you have ever seen what marshmallow is made from you can make it with eggs and sugar so apart from maybe flour I wouldn't say it's not a cake! Also you do realise that what you guys call a biscuit for the rest of the world is a scone and what you call a cookie we for the most part call a biscuit?
It’s a TEA CAKE.
That happened to me at a craft show, they said cake pops then it was just marshmallows 😭
Fun fact, in the netherlands that thing used to have a racist name!  Also, ehm, I love eating them! That's how I knew... I asked for the racist item... Oops
I love those way more than cake🤷‍♀️
In Israel we call them  crembo, which is like that but a cookie on the bottom
I am so happy you visited Christmas Market! Love from Greater Manchester ♥️♥️
It’s dutch, called chocokiss
Isn't that a tea cake? That's what I've seen them called on packaging and stuff
It's dutch its really good and really populair its called a zoen😅😁😁😁😁😁
in Israel it's called a Krembo! popular during the winter (since you can keep it outside,  and it wont melt & keep the soft thin choclate outer layer)
Where i’m from people love it but you’re 100% right, it’s not a cake. but we still love it
We call these tarboosh in Lebanon and they are so tasty 😍
As someone who had these at every childrens birthday, it is so fun to see someone not knowing what "chocolate kisses" are. They are indeed - not cakes - Don't know how they got their names 😅😂
It might actually be a tea cake(just a name) and it does have marshmallow fluff in it
Ey that’s a flødebolle which are hella popular in Denmark. But definitely not cake, really weird marketing strategy 😅
It's a tea cake, although I feel like that should of been stated
Its wat i like to call a bombom ,, but yet its not a cake at all. I was confused why u were disappointed cuz it looked exacly like a bombom, but then u said cake and i understood djfjdjd. But heyy it is pretty good, i hope they didn't made you paid alot for it, they are usually pretty cheap
This item is called kokosbolle. The English name is Foam ball. It is a Chocolate-coated marshmellow treat. But where does the foam ball come from? According to Annette Hoff, Scotland is a good tip. Here, the foam ball can certainly be traced to 1895, where it was sold under the name Chocolate Mallow Biscuit .
Ah I remember these, my dad used to bring them whenever he went to Germany  Sweet as heck but good memories behind them, never seen them sold where I live
U where in Manchester why did no one tell me I could a saw u
In Iran we have them too. We call these winter ice cream, since it’s kind of like ice cream and you can eat it in winter. I loved them when I was a kid.
Teacakes ???
In Germany we call this a Dickmann (name of the brand) or a Schokokuss (chocolate kiss) I never really liked these but they're kiiiinda enjoyable if you put them in the microwave for a vew seconds. They fluff up and look like they're gonna explode and the chocolate melts, you can also put it in a bun after microwaving and enjoy your Dickmann burger😁
It's a geman treat....it called chocolate kiss and is a waffle with cream dipped in chocolate....its very god in a bun
thats a big (something i forgot .. ,we often eat it here in germany!)
Please tell me you've had proper fish and chips already its sooo good
It's called a zoentje in the Netherlands, it's absolutely delicious, but not a cake as you know it. We call different things cakejes, so that's maybe what happened. Not necessarily false advertisement, but more of a language barrier. It's also a highly loved sweet here, so definitely try it if you ever come across it!
Haha i feel ya 😂❤
I'm from England and I hate those cakes. They are tea cakes and I cannot for the life of me, understand why people like them
In Portugal we call that bomboca. I thinks it's a waffle with marshmellow paste and a chocolate layer.
This is extremley similar to an Israeli snack loved by everyone there. It's called Krembo. It's a waffle at the bottom, with white soft almost whipped cream like filling, topped with chocolate for a full covering like this one! People LOVE it. It's as popular as doritos when they sell it.
Fun fact: Here in Germany they are called Negakuss (nega kiss). But most people call them Schokokuss (chocolate kiss), because of obvious reasons😅
This is a cake, but it’s called a tea cake in the UK.
In Germany it's called kiss cake (Küßchen).
This is really popular in the middle east personally I don't like it but a lot of kids eat it cuz it's so good and cheap
Well it kinda is a cake? Not the ideal one but we call it a teacake sometimes or atleast the people I know do.
How can you not loooooove it 😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
This is called a chocolate kiss in Germany and I believe the filling is actually made of egg whites and powdered sugar and it's really popular not only at Christmas markets, but also at all sorts of fun faires
Pee
Don’t bash our Christmas market 💔
I can't believe they don't exist in the US 😂 I'm sorry it was disappointing
who told you that was a cake, I've never heard it being described as a cake
Kokosboller!
It could be something else : a snowball / marshmallow covered in chocolate and coconut or nuts
Yeah as a person from here... Saying cake in the UK could literally mean anything so don't always expect what u think 😅
We call these tits here in brazil - teta
This called ras abed in arabic راس العبد and it's a popular sweet .
Hii, someone from Israel, those are actually NOT cakes indeed, but Krembos, cream on a waffle or cookie base covered in chocolate.
That's like a mallomar
I’m pretty sure that’s a tea cake 🤨
In germany we call them "schwedenbombe" or "schokokuss" like chocolate kiss
That's like a mallomar
oh im pretty sure its a tea cake
ITS A TEA CAKE !!!!
This one is kinda easy to see here on Brazil, here we call it "Teta de nega"
that’s a tea cake
קרמבו
Oh no, she ate the swedish bombs.
Omg I live in Manchester and I know the exact stall! I feel like most of the stalls in the christmas markets are a bit underwhelming imo unless ur with friends of course!
Please for Xmas try pigs in blankets, Yorkshire puddings and gravy!

in the netherlands we call these chocolate kisses!!
Here early! As someone who is from England, I love seeing you explore England and become fascinated by the ordinary things I'm used to. Also, we do have cakes. I'm sorry you were sold the walnut whip as a cake so you're disappointed. The walnut whip without the wrong description and explanation is indeed a luxury delight in the UK.
that actually looks good but.. CALL IT A CAKE?
It’s a British tea cake :))
That cake is an example of false advertisement at its finest.
cake or not i would eat that!
🍰 Who here would've been ok with getting surprise marshmallow fluff?
