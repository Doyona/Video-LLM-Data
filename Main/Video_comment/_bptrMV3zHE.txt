THATS INDIA LOVE WTH
Wqere
Can't believe half a billion people viewed this video 😮
I wasn't looking for your secrets,they came to me.
Time heals 🔥
I'm always here not matter my mom taught me that and I've taught mine and can't anyone try me cause my kids r my life forever and always they know mom I love my kids is my strength peace is what I want but people can bring that past to but I have God on my side but u don't know wat I look like but you'll feel me I'll find a way always my family is my life
2026 anyone??
INDIA LOVE??????
Not a vibe at its core it's more control and playing with someone's emotion. Expecting a woman to stay unhappy. She moves on and now he acts like a kid and fucks with her mind. More mind games. This isnt a love song but a way to control.
💙💙💙
💯💯💯💯
Still jamming in 2025
Is that india??
No he loves her so much
Each to their own I suppose, but for me this music is boring, unoriginal yet Drake is worth $ millions.

😢😢
August 2025
🔥🔥🔥
ESPECIALLY THE TRIGGER
Ik u sleeping. But I just wanted to remind you that you are a light. Ppl see u close and from a far and smile. U have a presence 2nd to none. Ur bubbly yet g as they come. Ur genuine. Ur beautiful and a blessing not just on the eyes but the way u carry yourself. Ur a breath of fresh air in a world where ppl voluntarily ingest smoke, I'm lit af. I'm sorry I'm so corny. But I can't not tell u how special you are. I only know u through text and on occasion I hear that voice, I'm not thirsty or saying I'm in love but I am saying u have me captivated, ur style, the way u think has me thinking about ur smile late at night, I'm trying to become a man of God and I can't help but  keep ur safety a top priority in my prayers, ik after u read this u going to think I'm odd probably very different. But that's okay 😊 ik 2 things, I want to get to know how to stimulate ur mind then master that body and be a presence that makes u happy/vulnerable enough to find out what real care is, and remind you that dreams aren't just a figment of your imagination, but are something that u alone can achieve but with a partner are likely. I'm sorry lmao I'm drunk AF rn. I probably shouldn't have sent u this. But I did
My love for this song ❤🎉
I miss you nep it’s oak u was my best friend
Great video !

This is a perfect depiction of God trying to give you greater and the demon of your past pop up when you’re about to enter a new chapter.   Stay strong people. It’s not worth it. Especially when God did so much to dry your tears and get you back on track when you thought you’d loose your mind.

Yo don’t the girl in da video look like India love or am I trippen.
"She dont wanna go to sleep she angry" always seemed out of place for me but i just peeped ending of drake's verse and it put it in perspective for me - "you should lay down we'll talk about it when you up" | ... "but she dont wanna go to sleep she angry" makes sense lol
Who came back to this video once they found out it was india love whole time 😂😂❤

Like if you’re in 2025 and just now realized this was India Love
People especially now have all kinds of things to say about Drake personally I like the dude.  Regardless of how you feel it's difficult to deny his talent especially on this track I feel like I'm terms of lyricism it's one of his best.  Ashamed to tell me friends how much I do for you cause they know that you would never do the same for me I wasn't looking for your secrets they just came to me and they contradicted everything you claim to be.
India love in this mf wth 😂🔥
India love is that you ❤

29 May 2025
I don’t like the video because this is how women are these days and it’s selfish asf to accept a man’s ring and say you will marry him just to get all the way to the altar after he put money into the wedding brought a new house you a car and spent hella money and his time on you to make sure you was happy so putting on a front in someone’s face instead of telling that man the truth that you was only gonna marry him because he  was so naive to not see the person you really are and that was a woman who was broken from a past relationship and you put all of your hurt on to this man to pick you up just to let him down 😢
If any 1 no i remmmeber bossie is the who found N I watched him give bossie 250 bands N thanking him N than Yung bleau says he never signed wit him man he put u on

How much money  why
Immortality
Crazy story, a girl I was crushing on for 20 years (since childhood) reached out to me end of 2020. She told me she was leaving her narcissistic husband of  about 20 years. He moved out with his mistress. 4 months in, I'm dreaming about this song and wake up about 3 am and she's silently crying next to me. I act like I don't see it try to go back to sleep.   I know what's going on. It's like the energy of him pulling her back was so strong impacted my dreams. She eventually left me 6 months in to go back. Just weeks later she's begging me not to give up on her and give her time to sort through her situation and come back to me.  I told in the break up process I had the dream of this song and new the day was coming. Oddly enough, she kept coming after me behind his back (which I allowed for a brief moment out of a vengeful mindset) and she has the nerve to send me this song when she finds out I'm talking to another girl. The fuccin irony. 😂  Till this day I have to keep her blocked everywhere cause she's still trying to get me back... Years later 🤦🏽‍♂️
I look back at this....she for sure look like someone you can't trust
Nahh I enjoy this shiittttt ❤😂😂
Any project 2025 should wait ❤😊
I love it

Yellow shirt sounds like a young version of Govanna
Why is drake listed ? Question I had for some time since seeing this video
1:35 look like a older version of asap rocky with low hair and a bit of obama 😂
0:24  Time may heal, but some wounds leave lasting marks. It’s not about forgetting it’s about learning to carry the pain differently. And with time, even the heaviest of burdens can feel lighter
2030 anyone?
Why are celebrities even involved in the crimes against me? Recording and watching as the bicious demonic entities F up my body and try to snuff out my existence altogether...

It's 11;32 and I was listening to it ate 9:00
Whoever is reading this, I wanted to say I hope you have a great day and that God loves you so much that He sent His son, Jesus, to die on a cross for your sins and He rose again from the dead three days later. God Bless!  And also, He doesn't want you to go to Hell, but He wants you to go to Heaven with Him but you have to be Saved. How do I get Saved you might ask? Here are the steps below on how to get Saved!  1. Believe that God sent His Son (Jesus) to die on a cross for your sins and that He rose again from the dead 3 days later.  2. Confess to Jesus that you are a sinner and ask forgiveness for your sins and Turn away from your sins. If you sin again after asking forgiveness of that sin, ask forgiveness again and try not to do it ever again. Jesus will forgive you!  ﻿﻿﻿3. Ask Jesus to come into your heart and your life and for Him to be your Lord and Savior forever.  ﻿﻿﻿4. Build a Personal Relationship with Jesus by Praying and Reading the Bible daily and Live for Him Forever.  I'm Praying for you and you are loved   (Romans 10:9-13)

i love this song❤
Drake sing n rap Kendrick can't sing
If bad mind was a person who would I post to be
I love it, but it kinda makes me sad because I heard your song and it’s Christian song called “God’s Gift.” I just thought the other day why hasn’t he made more Christian songs? I wonder if he stopped making music? I admire you for unveiling your raw emotions but remember you were meant MORE FOR MORE THAN THIS. Stand strong!!! Pain doesn’t last long!!!!! I think the enemy is trying you in this season. I think you have a huge calling man. Your song hypes me up and makes me stand strong against the enemy. Oh and your mamas message is sweet too!!!! Come on chin up solider in Jesus name. You are called!!! you are a son of Jesus!!!! Your identity isn’t in world things! Your identity is in Jesus. Please wake up and realize this bro!!! ❤❤ You’re so talented. I don’t have a Valentine. Jesus is my Valentine. It’s a day of love not about just one somebody!!! Add me on ig Nicoleloveslyfe

Toxic song fr fr but it's crazy how a lot of people's relationships are based on the idea of love but are really unwilling to live through it's reality.

Who heard this for the first time locked down on range in jail !! 😂
This song has a special place in my heart because this is how my previous relationship was when their secrets came to me and I left. Time truly does heal  I truly forgive and miss the person. But love is not that simple and time goes on.
Very lady like. Young ladies this is funny but this isn't what it is. We are more than bodies. We are the soul.

I used to play this song a lot back then and people thought I was listening to a love song 😂 As someone with ADHD I really connect with this song. Love is something that we chase for dopamine never to acquire it. This isn’t a love song or a break up song this is a reality of life song.
Aubrey the thief😂 rise and fall🇰🇪
The rise and fall🇰🇪
Honestly Drake is not needed on this song. No hate but i prefer it without his verse.
"I'M THERE NOW!" GOD GOT ME!" 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽

This could had been a good song without drake and swear words.
https://youtu.be/yiSVtdAMAxo?si=5zaF-Cj9YqtmWOEn
Separated for 3yrs, with the thought of NEVER EVER getting back with him. My heart ached so bad, that I tried to change it into anger towards him.  Got out, started dating 🤦🏽‍♀️  The dating world was sooooo freakin different, from 8yrs(at that time) ago. So I started being to myself. Men & women were coming at me, from all angles 😳 I stayed inside, meditating on my “perfect for me” man. My heart ached so dang on bad 😔 Tried so hard to forget about him, because of what all happened. The 3yrs was HARD; counseling, trying to forget & put him on the back burner, to let it burn. Lo & behold, this mutha sucka was sending letters, old pictures of us, greeting cards, gifts, meditations, etc., to my mom’s house, over those 3yrs. Found out that he went into a ministry that housed troubled males, found spiritual grounding, and never gave up on us being together. Dang near meditated on it every day for those 3yrs. 🥺 Didn’t know about this until halfway into the 3rd year, of being apart. Tried so hard to not let this new found knowledge, melt away the wall I tried to build up. 🤦🏽‍♀️ That build was definitely made out of straw, not bricks 😅 He was calling any & every one that he could, in order to try to get thru to me, until it finally happened. After a month, or more, of thinking that I’d be out of my dang on mind if I gave him a millisecond of my time, yet I caved.  Was still holding convo with other “potential” mates, but heard him out. Told him about the others I’ve tried to date & the ones pursuing me 😏 You know I had to 👌🏾 You think he cared? Not at all! Could hear his heart break a little but he swallowed that & continued to patiently charm his way back into my life. Along with other songs, he sent this one to me. Lol 😅🤦🏽‍♀️ He graduated from the ministry, being successful in the change that he made for HIS life. All that was left was him getting me back, so he felt 🤷🏽‍♀️  His prayers, meditation, determination got him his desires.  It’s been 3yrs now. Has it been easy? Heck no! Have we both been trying? Yes! Has he been determined to right all his wrongs? Yes! Will he allow this to end? Heck no! Time…. All things, worthy of the wait, takes time 👌🏾🫶🏾  ~Queen of Kings’ & King of Queen of Kings’ 👑💪🏾🙏🏾
Win he in. The car
PERHAPS
This really got me thru a 4 year bid I've done this girl so wrong 😪  she's my mother of my child and I did her so wrong cheating drug addiction due to a leg injury and so much more and she still here giving me a chance but the 4 years in prison with out her really opened me up thank you blue

Fred again..- Bleu version is good than this vesion
Damn💔
We always do mistake when we try to get back those we broke up with lastly, its not love but is only jealous that remains in our heart. We feel bad seeing them enjoying with others, we get more jelous thats why we fight to take them back. If we break up, we must let the other to enjoy themselves
That ending gets me every time.. 😢

The fall off is crazy, talking bout the same thing in all songs is crazy, love, heartbreak and Deppresion. People need something different not the same thing. Change is key to engage with a new audience.

Sometimes the worst part of going through or experiencing a heartbreak is KNOWING that you was most likely the best person in terms of soul and character for that person....and they still never saw it...
This man has problems. He don't want her to get married but he doesn't want to marry her. 😅😂

Yung Blue so first who is he?? or who are you like 4 real real ???? And drake is singing a verse in this song but you don't see him in the video so it's called ((your  mine still)) but what he says in this is where i actually started to pay attention at i think shes starting  to notice he ant me and then i wish we could change places sooooooooooooo if anyone has any idea or input on what you think that means please write back
You Bleu it pal. Waiter? Let me get some Bleu cheese crumbles for this salad. Are you Frech? Why is your name French? The French surrendered to the Nazis in WW2. they suck
Drake didn’t show up for the video ?? 😂
The lucky one is the groom. He almost made a mistake. 😂
Who is watching this in?2024
Okay, so I wouldn't normally go for this type of tune, but because they've used Stings guitar riff, I now want to hear a Mashup of this and 'Shape of my heart.' Please, DJs?!

Why do almost all these new *artists* use so many different things on their vocals when they record anything?  Really isn't many left that can actually sing/spit live and sound OP
That's fucked up....I would never leave my husband...the other person had way enough time to talk about marriage
He is so sweet he doesn't want to see her with any other guys ❤❤❤❤
Man that part about that type of hug you give when you smashed but know she never said anything. Drakes verse was  superb
Anyone in 2024!❤
life is a fantasy
PLOT TWIST🔥:  She originally chose someone else then came back now he had an whole elaborate plan to make her fall in love then leave her
who here in 2024?
Drakes the goat the world always hates the greatest

im mad for LeBron looking ass standing there like he dumb..
I know the feeling on her part
Imagine this if he had a ex was on this music and she was in the church as well it will turn on to a fight cause she will be talking smack fr
Dem teeth tho
this song low key describes a toxic relationship but in the least toxic way possible because like if u look at it from the pov of he doesn’t want her jus no one else can have her
Just wanna hug little wayne
"But pretty tought me a big lessions"
Yeah
😢😢😢😢😢😢
That dude look dead on Paul George
I use to believe this song was also dedicated to women in my shoes   now i realize its over i just try giving these young ladies some advice
He said that’s my woman 😂
This shit is the only thing for my life❤
I dedicate this song to all the people who ended up with the right person. You only get one life, use it to be with the person you belong with.
Aulinhas do Drake .

This is EXACTLY how I feel with my lay right now! I am in LOVE with her. She is too busy doing her own thing. I'm not upset about it i just know that we both are trying to build something together but we are in 2 different cycles together. I want to be with her and she wants to be with me. We are just too busy to occupies each other and we will get together when we do have time.

Godisiah es by Jeffery lashawn better not be touched by anyone
Plot twist. I love you and I miss you! Broken. Crushed like a broken mirror... 💔 can't stop crying. I hate this feeling.  There was no plan. There was no games or anything else other than the fact that I fell in love with you. You! You gAve me something to hope for because I felt something really good and I felt so alive and now I am just so alone. I feel like I am living in a purgatory/ twilight zone. This can't be life. This can't be love! This can't be US! I Never thought that I would be here without you. And I never thought it would be like this. Never!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

I'm not gonna lie. I didn't like this song when I first heard it because I was depressed. and even though I couldn't relate to the song Because i've never been married I can at least understand what heartbreak is And what it feels to be fucked in the ass
She a baddie! 😮‍💨🔥

Facts😔
Crazy in love with this one too lol
Time heals
Bleu and Blxst were at the Top of my Pandemic Playlist! They held LA down durin the Lockdown!
❤❤️❤️❤️❤️
2024 who listening to this
Don't know about anyone else but this sure does gives  mixed vibes.
When everything had a cold place then she fined me I paired up planet play list hint hold her mean wealth.
Everything ain't for everybody.If my first love wasn't sentenced to life or the death penalty then I could have prevented the entire thing another person's death and would have stayed by his side come hell or high water.
"HE DONT WANT HER, HE JUST DONT WANT ANYONE ELSE TO HAVE HER". ACCURATE AS F**K
❤😢❤
Maybe “him not wanting her now” is a one-sided view of the situation by say the artist & not say the record label whos opinion and verbal consent can’t be visually or verbally manipulated by a singers sole viewpoint on what music genres they promote.
Why get boobs go up
When Yung Bleu ❤ makes in the church
I pray 🙏 who ever reads this becames successful
My Spouse of 7 Lucky years Still can't take my word SAD ME....
Drake went absolutely insane on this 🔥🔥🔥
I have always loved this song. I had a boyfriend that died but we weren't together when he passed and I always imagined one of us interrupting each other's weddings. I have never gotten close to anyone since he died nor loved anyone as much as I loved him. However, I feel God has something else planned for me and this year after almost 8 years I have let him go and I am letting myself heal for the next chap that may deserve my heart. Rip dkb
This banger dropped at the perfect time
Well when you put it that way... nah I'm gud😂
Nvm he dont
He like him
Love this song ❤ It really be like that in some situations..
Dude she was standing up there with st first kinda looks like lebron james

I was thinking this was a really honest; sweet song until he walked into the church and said "let me beat that P***y up one more time" multiple times...it really killed the vibe for me😂😂😂. Still   a good song:)
Like, can anyone tell me where Drake at in the video?
Nice song by young bleu this song is greatest
girl in the vid fine
My life rn
Ohhhhh snap 🫰 I’m just realizing that that’s the chick 🐣 from Kountry Wayne skits
@MyKiersten
People really like this?? I grew up on Pac, Nas, Ginuwine, Foxy Brown, Sisqo, Dre, J-lo etc. This is not good music. Beat suck, delivery weak. Lyrics so so. I think moat of y'all who like this only like it because radio plays it. You have to understand that they pay radio to put this on rotation meanwhile real music not getting rotation ... well I guess you all also like sexxyredd or ice spice LMFAO you have no taste 🤣
Huh cayate
They say time still
The brides so beautiful😍😍
My girlfriend just cheated on me with my friend and she still wants to behave like she's innocent yet i caught her red handed. I dedicate this song to you Brenda hope you live happily with them.

Welcome back gang, This isn’t your 1st time back 🤘
No one talks about this as Drake’s top verse when saying #ColeWorld is the better lyricist in 2023. I’m just sayin, Cole probably is… but….😂
I love her truly just need honesty I'll always have her back love u baby girl
India so fine
This song tells my soul of the go get her moments with my baby daddy I will never understand how this young man can experience lyrically,something 2 people have been in syncing for 18 years. In just 3minutes of recorded music amazing!
Was that india?
He won’t commit to her or treat her with respect yet when she about to get married he decides to create a scene? He knows she loves him and always will so he does BS like that. Yet when will he put the ring on her? He won’t… but he doesn’t want her to belong to anyone else. He won’t let her be happy with someone else cuz HE not happy . Toxic mofos
No
Hit me
W droke 🔥
This that toxic ish 😩😩💜
Bet y’all didn’t know polo g was suppose to get on this somg
DADDY LOVES YOU DAIZY!!! FOREVER AND ENDLESSLY

0:31 If I ever If I ever left you hurt, my girl Just know, with time, it's a better world (world) They say time can mend She can't envision life without me, her heart confined To heck with that guy, make it clear, you're still mine  And she dreads drifting to sleep, consumed by anger Lately, she's found he's no worthy stranger I wish that we could change places No need for fresh new faces She quickens my heartbeat's paces They say time can heal Don't construct a life without me, you're mine still Oh, I won't depart unless you make the appeal  Pretty face, oh so tempting But pretty led me to lessons humbling Pretty had me giving more, it was troubling So if pretty comes empty, then I'm cutting the string Shame to admit to friends my devotion grew They know you'd never give the same, it's true I wasn't searching for your secrets, they unveiled to me And they contradicted all you claimed to be To the club, I took you, you hugged a friend, I know And I recognize those types of hugs, I'm in the know Same thing I'd do to others when I strayed long ago I'm down these days, aiming to improve, enough I've sown Lay it down, we'll converse when you're on your own  But she dreads closing her eyes, so much fury Lately, she sees, he's not me, the jury (he ain't me, yeah)  I wish that we could switch places No desire for unfamiliar faces She's got my heart in races They say time can mend Don't forge ahead without me, you're still mine And I won't leave unless you make the sign Down on my knees, praying you'll define Better inform that guy you're mine Heard you contemplate tying the knot, girl, say it ain't so Let me love you one more time before you go Let me love you one more time, let it show I know you crave this, you can't forget, you know So don't drift into sleep  And she dreads closing her eyes, so much anger Lately, she sees, he's not me, the danger  I wish that we could switch places No desire for unfamiliar faces She's got my heart in races They say time can heal Don't forge ahead without me, you're still mine Oh, I won't depart unless you sign Lately, I've been away, feeling insane Yeah, from the bricks, where we came with all our gains You've got tricks up your sleeve, and I'm intrigued by your claims"
Drake laying down in the back seat 😂singing
Where is Drake?
The actor ending
don't listen to this .ow. this.  Tevin Kampel.
Yooooo
I know the type of hugs
12:55a this reminds of what I wanted couldn’t have 😅
2023 & I still miss her ❤🤦‍♂
I feel this is probably about a female that put up with alot of bs and still was loyal and down for whatever as long as she was by his side..until she couldn't take his shit anymore, realized she was worth so much more and a REAL ONE CAME ALONG and realized he better lock it in quick!! (Though she wanted Young Bleu no matter how different her life would be..she would sacrifice anything to be with him)
One of the hardest hitting Drake verses that you’ll find out there.
YOOOOO IS THAT LABRON
😢
Who produced this song?
suck song

Fuck my ex 😂😂😂
I will never stop listening to this😩💗
Hahahah
You might not be present  in my life,You will always be in my heart .Sending Blessings ❤😊
When I was younger I used to seek love/happiness and as I got older I understood that love and happiness are fleeting emotions and aren’t sustainable; as I got older I understood Love is appreciation, not many will go the mile for you; it’s easy to care for someone but to be cared for is the real challenge. The curse in knowing that is not many know this until they understand it too.
Why the husband look like the cop from sunny with  a cloud of meatballs
who ever that girl is she is FINE
?q100. 💯
This me
1:21 1:27 1:32 1:33
I have to say young man beautiful singer I love you music I used to watch you on the Canadian station Degrassi and I really loved you on there the thing on the show you were in a wheelchair and I really didn't know who you were at the time and when you left the show watching TV and all the sudden I saw you out there singing I thought you was in a wheelchair but that's when I didn't know who you were

Nobody talking about how the dude she was ginna marry looks like LeBron James
The "baby daddy that can't handle his baby mama being with another dude" anthem
" Pretty had me giving more than I was getting, so if pretty don't come with something then I dead it" Insane
He don’t want her trifling Aztec.
Omg I had no idea this guy sang this song , it’s always in the radio and again I never knew  I love this song
This song really touched my soul, this song is helping get over my ex fiance! Still not over her but the song let's me know I'm not alone.
That is my dream wedding gown right thereee
Who’s song is this originally?
She chose a toxic cycle 🤣
This is the silliness of the music industry. Why would anyone leave the altar with someone they want to marry. For someone they left behind. Lovely melody but let’s be real. 😒
Look at baby India love ❤❤

Toxic relationship!

This my grandma doing the chorus on this song did you know the tragic story behind my "teen" ⬅️➡️ daughter's survived living trapped in our 505ABQ,NM ALBUQUERQUE grandma's house. She died horrifically from full body cancer. Plz reply from anywhere but Burque AkA: Albuquerque (505) thank you

Once he said let beat that shit up 1 more time she got flash backs lol im shooting somebody
Sting Shape of My Heart beat
i loev you
I'll always wonder what I could've done better. I gave my all into the relationship. We were two strangers living together but worlds apart. Past issues and emotional damage wouldn't allow us to grow as one. Selflessness and dedication to love, that was me. When I tried everything and nothing was ever enough, you blamed me. It takes two in a committed relationship to flourish. You're surrounded by friends who are quick to divorce. Instead of taking responsibility for your own actions, you blame me to justify what you did and never show any remorse. Your memory of us has faded, blinded by the devil's work. I believe love is the key to life. I won't give up on love, I won't give up on you.
Who's the girl thats the bride? She is so prettyyy and THIS SONG IS AMAZINGGGG

There is a church in my neighbourhood that the priest once asked if any one wanted to speak and a lady with two kids rose up. The priest asked the ushers to see her out and continued with the wedding. He said that if the lady had time to plan to attend the wedding she should have approached Him before the wedding to have it stopped

Stolen from XXX tentacion
Thank you for this video and the reset video. The reset worked great a few times. I was so happy to use cruise control again. Sadly it didn't last.    abs and electronic braking  lights are on in my 13 ram 1500. I had the code read at autozone. It came back as abs control module- internal electronic failure.   Would you be able to please tell me does that mean the abs control module needs to be replaced?
This song underrated
Man she was very glad to get out that marriage

I love this song and I am building a life as spoon as I get some money. I am a great person but he fucked my head up but I'm good dee
This song how I currently feel about my ex girl of 4 years…
Burga
I had this one ex in school that I recently met again cause she left my home country I got an opportunity to see her again because I’m in the country she’s in now. She’s got a kid now and she’s married now but she doesn’t love him she just doesn’t want to loose her kid to him. She’s moving away again and has to ghost me once again to prevent that. Things happened, we both still love each other very much but I guess it’s as they say if you truly love something you must let it go. It pains but I  hope that one day I meet her again I actually get her even if I’m gray and old I don’t mind her kid even if it’s not mines. This song keeps ringing in my head
Dope track 🔥love like this be so rare
This late ASF Fvcc but I feel Devin was mad ASF when he saw this 😂😂😂

I like this song so much it takes me back and back Tru my long times memories
Teenagers nowadays only dates for fun and most of the girls are hoes n goldiggers and most of the guys just want sex...... They date only for the benefits and the advantages not because they are really in love  my parents generation dates to marry because they are truly in love not just for fun
"let me beat that pussy up one more time ' hits hard 😂

If u ever read this just kno I loved u from day one. 😢 I'm letting u go n fly Live ur life to fullest I gotta leave it at this so I can live mine.  I hope u heal I hope u get everything I hope u shine.  I'll be on a farm singing a song u never heard but it'd be so familiar.  Letting go hurts but I can't stay stuck holding on  Cuz if u were really mine ud b right here in my arms  So I loosen my embrace ur my last arrow I release so now u fly away.  I'll move on but I'll shed my tears my way on a certain day.  My last goodnight I'm ready for mine in person from a ride or die so u gotta fly out my mind so she can find herself walking my way.

On God this was real life fa me💯💯my first marriage was not real for me and I shouldn’t have went through with it. My heart never belonged to him and i wish i could apologize fa that to him. I walked away with a lot of trauma and life lessons. I loved the man im married to now since i saw him at 15 yrs old. He was always meant to be my twin flame 🔥 and this life we built is all i ever dreamed it to be. Never settle in love yall💯👏🏾
I only watched this video cause of India Love
I really like this
I'm glad we finally have a song about the pain men go through in relationships. We always hear about men who treat women poorly but never these women who take advantage of men.  These lyrics resonated with me so much like drake said I didn't tell my friends everything I did for her because she didn't do the same and I still got cheated and gaslighted
She can choose who she want.... better tell me before I spend all my money on the wedding and all my family show up. Na, Chicago know how I'm getting down at that moment
This songs hits hard when you have crush while she is minding her own business and she doesn't even thinking about you.
💯
I hope you know I love you. I will wait for you I promise. I miss you so much.
Who else bouta eat n have sex ..o yea n get hiiiiiGH

Drake's Verse On This Song Puts Him On Top Of The Rap Chain , Don't  Play With The Owl Lordé. So my friend caught his girlfriend cheating massively she's kinda selling her kitty so that's beyond cheating to me, his heartbroken I gave my words of wisdom the little I know then I went forth and  introduced him to this song and this how his Villain Origin Began, Issa Evil World We Live In Mane 🚶🏿‍♂️

This is a real song Young Bleu 🔥 Drakes part would have suited a boogie wit da hoodie though.
9 years spent and got left when I was with my only living grandparent when she had a heart attack, surgery then got Covid when I was out of town to help her. He found someone fun at the bar. We had our daughter got a home and our dog was about to turn one and our daughter almost 3. The girl only spoke to him that night and ghosted him after he bought drinks and a hookup.

I love this song! So annoyed that drake isn’t in the video lol but whatever

I just feel bad for the groom who had no idea about that b&&&& weird life!!!
So this b&&&& wasted everyone’s time and embarrassed a man infront of many people, ran away with a weirdo who came out of nowhere who is toxic to her   Wow what a shitty story and sad thing is people find this romantic yikes!!!
Shit crazy how time changes people stay solid 🤦🏽
Flat my tires really  you'll catch them charges  He pop that shit to my face  Spit them bullets let's watch him dodge em
🤐
This ding give stalker vibes cause dudes that think like this be stalker especially when young Blu remind me of my stalking ex
Damn this hits hard on valentines😵‍💫

second song for my girlfriend's ex...

I truly love you Zack 💖 I hate that I ever did you wrong... You're the only man that has truly loved me.. if I could fix everything I would in a heartbeat but you look at me and life so differently and that's my fault...
I luv this song
This song gauuut me fealing some type ov way. 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I’m just glad blue winning Maine
pretty taught me ugly lessons too
Heard my friend jamming one of his song called "beautiful lies"some days ago and I was like who is this dude because that song is freaking fire....Then I decided to check him out,I'm happy I did because I go to bed with the song he makes
Drake's verse hits home too close to home
I saw my ex the other night but got reminded about this song just a bit ago. Shit's hella relatable. You know you're bad for each other but you want it still?
This reminds me of that show Called a different world.That had Jasmine Guy on there where she goes & ends up almost marrying the wrong guy until the love of her life crashes her wedding.
THIS IS THE REAL KING JON YOUNG AND MRS YOUNG BODY SO DONT INPERSONANT ME ANYMORE THANK YOU
In case you’re wondering the video is fake he does miss it

When you transformed into her like you were walking her down the street I think it was your grandpa that was walking her down the plane but then it turned into you walking her down to the Lane so I thought that was really cool all-around Yung Bleu
That change in facial expression at the very end says everything.
When he shows up and take her back.
Nice video, shows how easily a women is deceived.
I told you,i dont have to hang around a choir to be blessed them skirts will rise up when they see a newborn at church,so get off of my piano with a pool stick in your hand,i got 2 sticks to beat the drums,if you take one here comes the other

''I took you to the club and you hugged on somebody that I know and I know them type of hugs same shit I do to woman when I know I uses to fuck and I know they with they nigga and they never brought it up'' I felt that shit so hard(shout to Drake on that🔥🔥🔥)

'I took you to the club and you hugged on somebody that I know And I know them type of hugs Same shit I do to women when I know I used to fuck'  this verse hits me really hard 😣 it wasnt at the club, but at my birthday party. my girl hugged my best friend in front of my eyes and I felt very bad, I thought my world was falling apart. three years have passed since that situation and since they are a couple. despite everything I wish them all the best and today I feel much better because I learned a lot of lessons :)  I think its not about what happens, its about how we respond, time really heals!!
I'm not down for this showtime.....  talk about true players..... I'm not playing with you or anyone anymore  thanks for the memories
Better tell that heilfer you still mine
Beautiful rapper singer
the whole scene of the church 🥰😘& driving off ❤️🖤

Idk they both look toxic as hell...i think the man she left at the alter really made out the best
Just imagine getting married thou
I've been here on this earth for an about an hour and hearing this song makes me want to say I see everyone jokeing and laughing but when it comes to the ugly I see a way into heaven I give the Lord thanks for everything she gave me and I only pray woman nowadays get a clue I don't part-take in action unless me myself and I have a good time but then again she's breaking my heart knowing she wants no part of me to love her.
Can someone kiss my comment I wanna come back 🔙 to watch it

Drake murdered this verse ... Crazy
I wish someone would sing like this for me yooh. Telling me that I can get out their life but I'm still theirs.

LeBron James :-) be like
I met this women over 10 years ago. Long story short find out she was married & they was having problems and he had another girl. I didn’t expect things would happen with us but they did.  I found out she still slept with him and I started to go out and mess around. She dipped but then started to talk to me again . After 10 years she’d would disappear and then hit me up.  That was in the beginning of the first 10 years lately we still be talking. And if it wasn’t for her I’d would’ve been locked up or dead. I tell her everything.  When things bout to go down she puts me in check and make me see things differently.  I lean on her cause she always keeps it G with me. No matter what.  I quit lying to her and really opened up now. She still has me. Sometimes I just don’t wanna be here anymore. My nephews and nieces keep me here. And she still looks out for me. To this day. I say this is us in This video. Ah people might think I’m dumb for sitting here . But it’s what ever .  Our souls wrap around each other and when she dipped. A part of ours still attached to the others.  I think she outta my league . She’s amazing person.  Just wish things was different.
Run
He has the greatest voice. I swear!

I am in love with this song😍
I want to dedicate to my ex baby girl I still love you
She’s gonna get f*cked a few more times, realize he’s not changing, still a cheater, and never going to commit to her, then she’s back to that brother she left at the alter because she realized he was the real deal, but it’s too late cause he realized she ain’t sh*t, so he’s gonna f*ck a few more times then leave cause he’s got better baddies to attend to. 💯
❤
Pov: she scratches my car *divorce*

iconic sample from Sting
💯💭💨🌬️  I know how to be respectful. I know how to be mean. I know how to be good and I know how to be bad. I know I can be anything and everything all of the time and I can be the time as well.🎉❤😮😊
I love this
The opposite of love is not hate. It's indifference.
You will always be mine ❤
Who else had to rewind @1:27

Drake, but look at my assist!!

He sampled a Sting backtrack https://youtu.be/NlwIDxCjL-8
Drake said he knew that type of hug because he did it to other women lmao it’s karma drake
Jason holguin❤️MO 4-LIFE
This video always makes me laugh. He cock blocked her wedding being selfish to keep her to himself but ends the video looking upset with the "tf, now what? What did I do or the ah sh*t am I stuck with her now?" look while she's celebrating. I can't be the only one who notices this. 🤣🤣
i love this guy i live up the street from him super real guy
❤️‍🔥
POV you're a delusional loser who can't get over your ex  Song sounds alright though
Shepherd's Chapel Network !!!!!!! Do you know where America is mentioned in the Bible ??????? Shepherd's Chapel Network !!!!!!!
not gon lie one of drake hardest feats
My favorite part is where she a hoe but not your's. Change that scratch voice eye on me. Sent her out yellow stunn. Finish ends to meet the swap ear in gold but she took off. You remove the medal off , speak after kfc do with them
Know better to replicate or not participate. Earrings Spanish to Jesus dislocate. Answer noun back verb wear out you I Let's the Ms into rude out the wind blow back run cause fuck how , on how end with cars but one left drive out camera alone back up the rear daisy and still the show how
Toss a sandwich but she hungry for dick. Don't start second without heading out. Strike see how union don't stop.second third fourth fought back fuck you once nine second third time I count. Down the city lounge have dinner over and out second I miss she bring em back. Take them off myself but triggering our heart would end book covers. Bags in my eyes that coffee I end sugar half time half time seconds in a minute I start she count to pop. Smile there ain't one behind with all that her comes what. Shoot for the n and say near everything sound word I'd be lord king after a bitch kill 1- 0 gone so no buy back
One day you will, and wake Jake. Seconds away from yes earn NY. Empty email box being asked but back end tore. Themselves since next drink. Red wine bring her out to her you stand out. Woof
Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
Hahahaaaa Oooohh No he didn’t just ask to beat tha P** coming in the church 🤭🤭🤭
my favorite part was young bleu busted in the chappel thats right get ur girl
Drake said "I wasn’t looking for your secrets they just came to me and they contradicted everything you claim to be..... " Bruhh!!! 😫 I know I'm not the only one who felt that.
"Pretty face, pretty tempted But pretty taught me ugly lessons Pretty had me givin' more than I was gettin' So if pretty don't come with somethin', well, then I dead it"  felt that🥺
Then no woman like the one I've got
shit crazy how this song hits when u can relate to the video 😂 me & my ex broke up & she said she wouldn't get with anyone cause she wanted to heal & now she got another nigga lmfao 🤣  bitches ain't shit
Me to me 💛💐💐🖖
You Are More Than Enough.
Vvcccccc=
She’s so pretty
He really walked into chruch and said, "Let me beat this p**** up one more time." 😭
Drake. We will never get another. My opinion the best artist I've ever heard. Not rapper, Artist!
Wazzup yo! It's me! Yo Boi Joe DRT Tha Guru on all platforms! Let's do music soon! #rojo2022!!
Shoutout Fred again..
I like. This song ❤
Good songs good job so cool
On Bd I love this Song this for my Bby Alexis
is that the guy from cloudy with a chance of meatballs??
This was once’s my baby father we had been together since 14 and I had officially broke it off when we were 23 years old. no matter we’re I went he find me n mess up any relationship I was in but have all these women n baby mamas. I’m #1! But we had love them others loved him for what he had n what he could do.
Ok ok OO 9oooo
I just deeped drakes not in the video
This song gives me chills...
Stg I’ve given this song 50K views hahaha
1minute 44 seconds are original not drake's but maggot steals everyone's shit just like he did to xxxtentaction rat!
Can we fix our past life's dreams and reality? Or can we just enjoy the feelings we thought we once had. The longer we think about how the past was the easier it is to not see it for what it once was, memories from the past.
Such a beautiful song ❤️
YO AMÈ!💛🌷💛

Her 🍒 🥴🤤
This guy stole Sting AND Adelle's style! 😁
Good bro keep it up #ovio
Is love a curse?
https://youtu.be/01iQjIaQnYM
This songs can be put into so many contexts. On one hand it could have you missing the person you did everything for and not realized your own worth in that. The other way could have you realizing your own toxicity and not letting go and understanding the fact that something you took for granted now belongs to someone else. Either way there’s a lesson. The lyrics of this song hit deep especially when you are emotionally attached. No matter how much you try to move as long as you keep looking back at what once was you continue to create opportunity for the past to come back. When it’s over let it be over. It’s not going to be easy but you have to do it if you value yourself and know your worth. Handsome taught me ugly lessons.
Damnnn, I thought this song was about having to sell his car
I wonder if he can really sing without the autotune, bro raw as hell with his writing too!
Rachel Levy and DjKilLaBee.

Babygirl n qaunzes
Hey
The real story is he's taking her to save the other guy. The lyrics paint a picture that says the she's an extremely toxic person. Maybe he's knows how she is and doesn't want the guy to go through what he had to go through. Yha part of him may still love her so it makes sense he would take her (and the other guy) out of that situation. In the process of this (not what he thought would happen to prove shes like that but hey!) She proves to the guy that she never even loved him by pushing him back and taking dudes hand.
The undefeated toxic soultie strikes again!!😅😅
My favourite song I play this song everyday
My favourite song I play this song everyday
Gemini men be like. 😭😭😭
I think an miss the love of my life Dwight Dwayne Johnson Jr. he chose not to stay with me and I can't stop wanting or missing him an his 2 beautiful girls. Bo Bo an nena. He doesn't know I can't let go. I still look for him. I catch my breath at the thought it was him but I saw instantly it wasn't him. This is my song to him putting that positive words out there to see if it will bring him an the girls back in my life. My life hasn't been the same. I love you so much other than your girls im your biggest fan.
crazy how many view he has and me and nun my people ever heard one song but songs from other people under ten mill everyone knows lol it was the same for rod wave for me but i started listening to him and realised everyone does but mostly at home or when riding alone but yung bleu never once heard anything only know him cuz of boosie lol
He don’t need no auto tune either
Intro like Juice world - lucid dreams

He needs to make more tracks like this!
The past can be haunting, but as the saying goes, fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me. If you didn't learn it didn't work the first time around for some substantive reasons, will it take another time of walking through the fire at your own expense to prove the point. Be smart, if it proved unworkable the first time around, people and circumstances don't change much, and importantly you can't change them. Move on to something new, fresh and most importantly that has promise. God bless and good luck with all your fresh starts and new endeavors.
The end was my fav
How about deciding if u actually wanna marry someone or not BEFORE the wedding, cuz any person that does this and embarrasses their fiancé at the wedding by changing their mind last minute, deserves anything that happens to them, that includes getting slapped.
🐝
Yes you are not loljk
Can someone tell me what it means when my ex send me this song and they dating someone but then my ex told me that’s how his feelings are and he said to listen to this song but can someone tell me what he means about it I really need help bc I can’t anymore 🥀💔🥺😭
OK mo3
What is the name of the woman in the video?
My ego won’t let me get back with none of my exes. As soon as I’m with you then you step out with another man my heart drops you right away. This song doesn’t fit my criteria.
Juice world?

I'm a Charles fan, but if Islam does dominate him doesn't that make Islam the best lightweight on the planet? You have to be fair on both side, if you say Oliveira is too good for Islam, let's just keep that same energy after the fight
Boosie said you still belong to him... 100k to a boss after you took money from them ppl... bad bizzness

To the individual who is reading this please quit overthinking everything every day and night . Stop obsessing over your failures. Stop doubting yourself and seeing the greatness in everyone else but you. You are better than that. You deserve more. Start showing up differently to yourself. Believe in yourself. God wont ever hand you something you cant handle. You are a star in this world ❤. may God Bless whoever sees this!
Felt dis one but I'll be the one to say it time don't heal...

when are you coming to DENVER,co
I dont agree that every door closes for a reason. I feel that if something went wrong and you were too angry, immature or didn't have the right tools to sit and talk through the situation it can make it feel like it was closed for a reason. Personally for me I resonate with this song in two ways that hurts and has literally gave me a major set back in realizing that I'm blind right now. And because of this many of us could be pushing the right one away. I believe you get at least 2, sometimes three partners that are the ones. But if you still holding onto an ex emotionally this can make everyone after them seem like a joke or like yeah this is not working because we are arguing. But it actuality all you are doing is taking your anger and trauma out on that person. So until you face the truth and go through it you will remain stuck
Ngl he look like lebron james
Love you janelle

Jesus Christ Saves  Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is returning very soon, and is the reason for all of the things that are happening on the Earth right now. This planet is on borrowed time.  Jesus Christ died on a cross, was buried in a tomb, and rose from the dead 3 days later, to pay for the sins of mankind, to give us eternal life and forgiveness from God.  EXACTLY how to be Saved by Jesus Christ, the Son of God:  1. Confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord.  2. Believe in your heart that God has raised Jesus Christ from the dead.  Biblical References: 1. Romans 5:9 2. Romans 3:23 3. Romans 6:23 4. Romans 10:9 5. Romans 10:13 6. Ephesians 2: 8 & 9 7. John 3:16  God bless you, peace be with you always. Thank you for your time.
Trust me: I was garbage just like him in the video. These guys ain't shit (me too in the past) Date the person who wants you no matter what. Not when he sees you're in love with someone else
Danny you still

This was my beloved Wife Donna favorite song. I'm so lost without her. Rest in peace my love. I'll always love you and miss you more than anyone else probably will. Because you gave me the most precious gift any husband could ask for. And that's our beautiful daughter Lovelynn Rose. I promise to always be there for her and I'll always protect her. I miss you so much and I will never love another woman for the rest of my life. You have my heart.
Hi there stranger. You don't know me but I wanted to spread the good truth of Jesus Christ if you would like to take the time to stay and learn more.  See God created the first of humankind and gave our first descendants dominion over the earth and things in it but we soon rebelled against God and so sin was born into the knowledge and actions of humankind. Thankfully enough we have the opportunity to rid ourselves of sin and reconcile with God the holy father through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ the son of God. He died on the cross for our sins and took the punishment we were supposed to receive, defeating sin in the process and freeing whosoever seeks salvation in him.. giving unto them a new and beautiful life with him as a born again child of God. I would love to see each and every single person on this earth receive salvation and avoid eternal damnation so I spread the good news in hopes that I can get as many people to repent and receive Christ before his second coming. The kingdom of God is near. I pray that who ever reads this considers a life in Christ and repents from the wickedness of this world before it's too late. We don't have much time.  Jesus loves you and so do I <3 Be blessed my loves<\3 JOHN 3:15 -21 MATTHEW 3:2  MARK 1:15 ❤
Don’t go by build a life without me cuz you mine still. That hit me hard I miss the person I love unconditionally . It’s been hard without him . Damn..😔😔😔😔

This was my very best friend Daniel song to me. Unfortunately on June 28th, 2022 he called and we talked for hours and he told me just how much he loved me and would always remember us.. 22 minutes after we hung up, he committed suicide, sadly. This song means so much now, even more then before!!! I love you, my angel, I'm so jealous of heaven!!! #LongLiveDaniel #DDD #ForeverandAlwaysPlus1day #Myangel #ILoveYou #BestFriends
They say tiiime heal!!!!

My favorite part is When it ended!!!! Same ole Auto tuned out BS nobody is doing them, they copy. He is a Joke to me, IDK why DRAKE messed with his ass. These kids all use auto tune and sound the same.
Pretty face, pretty tempted But pretty taught me ugly lessons Pretty had me givin' more than I was gettin' So if pretty don't come with somethin', well, then I dead it Ashamed to tell my friends how much I'd do for you 'Cause they know that you would never do the same for me I wasn't lookin' for your secrets, they just came to me And they contradicted everything you claimed to be I took you to the club and you hugged on somebody that I know And I know them type of hugs Same shit I do to women when I know I used to fuck And I know they with they nigga, but they never brought it up I'm down these days, down to do better, 'cause you know I done enough You should lay it down, we'll talk about it when you're up

This one on repeat……touches my soul every time !!!!
Who else miss this drake
2:49   Is me after I break up with my ex but I know she still loves me
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This song must be good if I say it's good because I'm not a Drake fan and these youngsters don't put any life in songs or video's these days... But this song right here is nice man, I'm late, I heard of Bleu but never listened to his music.  His talent caught me off guard. I'm a instant fan...
Use this ass the this song hit my heart button ❤️🤞🏾
🔥🔥😍
💔
Young Bleu to the world💯🥰
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ok ,so when she wakes up n the morning and Bleu is like this was a one night thing I didn't say bring yo toothbrush type shit and she has to walk in the house and look that nigga n the face is where the real video starts
Idek why this song doesn't have 10 or more million likes 🔥🔥🔥❤❤🇹🇹🇹🇹🇹🇹
1:29 Lebron
The fact that the
He really did not need drake in this song
This Artist should sing more like this,his voice is mature.
Should also say "feat. Sting" for that background audio, sampled from Shape of My Heart.
And is Dat 100%
Er
💪💪💪💪💪💪
Hit deeps 💔
Bro Collab or sign 'Chlöe' cuz she maken it in she got known from a remake on dis.

This song will never get old ❤️
Good artist,good song,big up Bleu and OVO drizzy
Song sucks
same
wow those loves... that never let you go, become a part of who you are if you are lucky, you survive it, never go back, and can find the gratitude to have lived love so intensely with someone
my favorite  song from Bleu actually  the only song l know from him....explains how l have sabotaged  my possible  relationships for my toxic  ex....in a good   space now  though without  him and loving  it
Drake ate this bitch this shit still legendary
I would love to a hear a female spin off this, the lyrics give me goosebumps. 🥺
99% of you thought of that someone when you played this 🤣😭
God place help me what my heart turn
🔥🎵💯💙❣️✈️🚀
Roxanne and Eduardo = eternal love.
Say my name 📛😅📛🧨
This fact that he showed up to her wedding and was like "what is going on here?"
Got her back and still gone cheat
Drake greatest alive
🔐🤞🏽
And then she doesn't get a ring from him, just gets her heart played with more
Nice car
A beautiful piece of work. This video explains how messed up our love life is as teenagers. It’s sad how love can be so toxic.
What the fuck
dont go build a life without me
This song makes my day❤️
Wat is her name
Is that the scene from Norbit🤣🤣🤣
I saw my ex for the first time in 3 years at the mall and the jewelry store we past by was blasting this song 🎶
Love 💕💕💕💕😘
Should've jumped in a srt dodge charger instead of that old crap .. would've got better women

Damn so much abstract and content well done
"any objections ?" "Let me beat that pussy up one more time"  lmao real romance right here
😍😍
Love it
GREAT SONG !! WONDERFUL JOB !! GREAT MIX REALNESS
Why do I miss him so much when all he did was treat me like a dog ,use me, and cheat with my Friend all after haveing a son together can anyone help answer me this
🔥
If she started crying I would start crying to , a cold godess
I feel like he messed up bad. But the love they had cant be erased no matter what happens. That what real love is. She loves him to but the fear of him hurting her keeps her away or hesitant to give her self to him again. But the moment he walked through the doors of the church(which shes been hoping for) she knew she had to choose. Live a lie or give her soulmate the last chance, that she Hope's will be worth it. I think he wont mess up because he saw how close her was to losing her. And things will work out just fine. What do you guys think the videos about
This song is real. I definitely felt this one, for real. 💯
Girls namw
🔥🔥🔥 … 🥰 always and forever …
On GOD
Why

Nueva
My ex sent me here…🤔🤨🧐
ETERNAL PRESSURE!!!

This is a beautiful song
This song forever a vibe
This is a beautiful song with so much meaning ❤️
Urghhhh!!! Too much of autotune 😣
2022 and I still get mellow when this song plays.
Open
I'm still yours.
Nostalgic 💯
what is this auto tune nonsense. I feel Drake was disrespected by even being associated with this song .
the autotune is awful
Plot twist. I won't run off w him instead I will marry the man who truly  wants me
Good
I can't stop thinking about my ex even if I know I'm the one who broke up with him 😭😭
They say time heals.
This song and Wale ft Usher Matrimony has the same ending. The bride left the groom at the alter to run off with the plug… 😂
I found this song because I’m a Nate Rhoads fan and I recorded to many of his beats. ❤️🔥🔥Love what you did with this one!🎤
Its good song
The starting looks like heartbreak anniversary.....giveon 😁🥰

Former Death Row Records Artist Timothy Lorenzo Hurd better known by his stage name ''TRO The Realist Out'' is considered to be a driving force on the West Coast. He knows being lyrical is not enough. You have to have the complete package. You have to look the part, act the part, and be the part. The girls have to love you and the guys have to want to be you. You have to have that swagger, energy, attitude and talent all combined into the perfect package to make today's rap star. And that's exactly what TRO is The Complete Package.
I love your song
Hey man. the first one is not a big part in the future is
Hey man. the other day I will not have a good idea. the first to write a note on my phone number. I am going on with your own ,
I wish drakes verse wasn't in here. Kinda throws it off. From her being yours to talking crap about her. Can't use the song
Got or cool yeah girl!!!!

When I listen to this song it really hits in the soul almost like it's about the one who got away or the one you  really expressed your feelings too and maybe things would have turned out different.! I feel like I'm on to something.

Blue carried the song hard
What her @
She is a certified hood baddie
pretty much I figured treat yourself bfor you put All of your energy in to a relationship that is ov or should I say over there now. Live and let go and move on. Plenty of fish n da Sea (for if you see my point)👀. Time will eventually heal. Love your self / Mental Health. #lovesent
Drake really couldn’t show up for the music video ☠️
Oh chords from the past, how sweet they may sound against the shadows of the stark realities of the present. But old difficulties, differences and dilemmas were not spun from cobwebs that will magically be swept away by the present. They may just look appealing at the time due to the rose colored glasses we often tend to don when re-examining our past. If problems were unsolvable in the past, chances are, they will remain the same, if not more so in the future. Sometimes the past is best carried in your heart, remembering the good times, but leaving best enough alone. Godspeed.
This is my shit I love dis zoo dude rite here
This song hits different knowing.my favorite ex got.married a month ago

At alllllll....wtf happened to this generation?

1:20
esa pista es aca de un grupo de rapero peruano , es parecido
Y'all did your thing .I'm loving the vibe but the words brought baick memories from my past 😂 I messed tht up.
Drake:   "Pretty face, pretty tempted But pretty taught me ugly lessons Pretty had me givin' more than I was gettin' So if pretty don't come with somethin', well, then I dead it Ashamed to tell my friends how much I'd do for you 'Cause they know that you would never do the same for me I wasn't lookin' for your secrets, they just came to me And they contradicted everything you claimed to be I took you to the club and you hugged on somebody that I know And I know them type of hugs Same shit I do to women when I know I used to fuck And I know they with they nigga, but they never brought it up I'm down these days Down to do better 'cause you know I done enough You should lay it down, we'll talk about it when you up"  And Drake:   "You can only rap about it you've been thru it. Oh Yeah, why doesn't this video have  more than a billion views?"
Who’s the girl tho
❤
You got it bad when you’re dedicating this song to the same person for 2 years now. Pray for me y’all.

Most underrated from the state
Where is drake?
I had feelings for a older man and ended up having his baby and I wanted to be with him for awhile but I ended up leaving for jobcorps and after I have the kid I knew the relationship wasn't gonna last because he treated me like any other baby mama he dealt with just to sex on them to think he's healing them when they go attached just to branch off to find out that he was only there temporarily to help you and not be in a relationship with you because it hurts when he's still married and lied about being married (or felt like that) then you gotta fall out with him because it's hurting me bad in the end.😞🥺😭😭I should known it wasn't gonna last! All those feel good words he said like your mine to make me fall in love with him when I should known it wasn't gonna last! That's what happens when a man knows how to sex you down and make you attached! I'm the fool in the end and got played....simply because I fell for a trap that I didn't need to be in and now I gotta put my wall up all ovr again 😭😭💔
A
Real........
It’s just like a toxic ex to pop up at the moment that she’s ready to move on with a MAN and stop playing games with lil boys 🙄😂😂
Video is deep about seeing the guy everywhere you look, it's not them but your mind thinks it is💯 deeeeep
This is my favorite song I like to listen to it on YouTube on my phone and when it comes on the radio. 📻

If just one person reads this it will make my day. I'm a music artist from Virginia. So I'm fully aware that folks usually post these comments all the time, but I honestly do  believe that I'll be the one person who you'll be so happy that you did hear out. . If ONE PERSON could just give this a thumbs up, you will be a great step closer to helping a person's dreams come true. I swear that I don't suck and you won't be disappointed. I Just need one chance and 3 minutes

Song is top tier but it killed me when he barged in said"let me beat that pussy up" at 2:54
The way he chased after her that's the one
Love my sissy
Sad 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I'm reading a book and doing a workbook called "The journey from Abandonment to Healing" by Susan Anderson.  She talked about the phenomenon of separating from someone you love deeply and then seeing them when they're not there.    She talks about the part of your brain that is triggered when separated from someone you loved is equivalent to a mother losing her child,  the brain kicks into overdrive to help you to be able to recognize the person in a crowd,  and send signals to your body that this person is needed for your survival.    I'm not explaining it perfectly i know 🤣🤣🤣 but this video made me think of it!   When i separated from an ex this would happen to me alll the time and I would feel so crazy!! Thinking I saw, felt, or heard his voice when he wasn't there!
They say time heals 😪💝 don't go build no life without me cause your mind still 💘😒
🔥❤🎤🎤💪💪💪
Grandma - “ Where she going ?”   Me - To let him Beat that pussy up one more time   Grandma-“ MMMNPH THAT IT 😡?  Me- “Yea ,Toxic isn’t it “   Grandma- “ Hell yea, left that damn man at the alter , smh these young folk ! * snatched her head and crosses her arms *   Left that man at the damn alter   I was weak

This song touches my heart because I once touched someone's soul, it just belonged to someone else at the time and I respectably ended it but there are times I send her this song as a reminder that we did once love each other but I had to do the right thing and return her to her original owner 😭 it's sad they always come back.
Good luck Washington State the girls next door
Yea we do have to do the
Know when you guys can do that and then she will go
My favourite moment is when she realised it ain’t him

"Better tell that niqqa you mine."
She definitely  should  have gotten married,  the ex only saw value in her because she was no longer accessible.  Dont let the facts get blurred between emotional lines that are no longer parallel. #StoneLyricist
What's good to all my family and friends free Derrick and that's all I gotta say let beat it up one more time
🌬️🔥🔥🔥🔥💨
Damellad
Destiny is good ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🩹💗💓💖❣️💕💘💞💝
I love your song
This song hit different. It's like you wrote this specifically for those who are going through something or been through something. I wanted my ex to hear it but I didn't want to show my hand, the game changed when he said he wanted me to hear a song and this was the song. I was okay now!
I just got blocked and I'm hurt YALL
My favorite moment is when he bust's in the church door and she looks up and sees him....that smile ,that look she had on her face when he busted thru those doors and her eyes met his....it was a wrap...her face said it all the the smiles they both had on their faces while running out was beautiful ❤️
Love love love this.,.you feel EVERY emotion he's goin thru in the video...bad azz song and video...I love me some dude he's very creative !
1:30 why the dude look like if lebron and george floyd had a baby
imma miss this time
Anytime I hear this song,it feels like getting my ex back🙏🙏
Cause your mine still.🙏🏼💪🏽🔥👊🏼🤲🏽💯❤🌷💐💣

This song right here dedicated to my girl Alma 💙💙💙😢
i think i saw a trimmed hair version  of asap rocky
This track plays everyday on my playlist which is a idk strange coincidence I guess you could call it because me and my girl ex girl idek what we are ATM but we're going through the a really shitty time in our relationship but to understand just how special this relationship is you'd have to hear the whole story but in order for that you'd have to have little time and n your hands because it'd take a few for me to get it all out but to my point this track reminds me of her and how she'll always be mine still no matter where in life we've gone  my love for her will never die or fade she's always been and will always be my one and only forever true love Amanda I love you baby girl never forget that
Good song ❤️❤️❤️

She bout to marry fortnite guy?
She looks like korlaray
Me and my ex used to say if we ever got married to someone else, wed barge in and stop it and leave together..
POT FARMER SONG $$ I got out my pipe and stuffed it with pot You better believe, it held a whole lot. I whipped out a lighter and thumbed up a flame Then sucked down that smoke which comforts my brain.  I tried alcohol; and smoked cigarettes Though, they did nothing, but give me regrets. My mom had arthritis and couldn't walk around When I rolled her a joint, she danced on the ground.  I thought I was losing my lovemaking knack But, after I smoked some, to me it came back. Soon I decided prices were high So I searched for some ground I wouldn't have to buy.  I bargained for seeds from smokers all around Then, got in my truck and drove out of town. I walked through the woods where the wild birds nest And found me the meadow I thought was the best.  I dug up the ground and sowed all my seeds Then said a small prayer for strong, healthy weeds. I watered at night with a five-gallon pail The mosquitoes went hungry for I wore a veil.  Seven months went by; I thought I would die Till the Halloween moon was high in the sky. At night I went out, in my camouflage suit And used a corn knife to chop down the loot.  I hung it up to dry where it couldn't be found. Then came back and got it, when it had turned brown. I trimmed off the buds, and stuffed them in bags Called all my friends and passed out free drags.  In less than a week my crop was gone But I flew to St. Thomas with a love hungry blonde!!

Every time I hear this song, I think of Nas  classic "The Message". Shout out to Sting  for allowing them as well as other artists to sample 1 of your hits!
She for dem streets anyway, not wife material, let's keep it a buck .
This whole song is a vibe the chorus is amazing the video is absolutely beautiful and drakes verse is mad underrated! Love this song.  One love 🤙🏾🖤

My. Favorite. Song
My   Mom.  Like
Yung bleu: she don't wanna go to sleep she angry
Wait... was that ending a reference to "The Graduate"?
It's a cold blooded thang to leave a Man at the alter. In real life they would messed up that church fighting lol.
15-2-22 🤍🦋
Me and my cousin are a huge fan
This song hit different ❤❤
Yung Bleu much respect bro auto tune is out of control  gotta get your vocals right
1:35 asap focky
May we always have a beautiful days
This is NAS beat -the message
I just came back around after 2 years when 2 years ago i had to let go of someone i wanted to spemd my life with, so i have to atleast try to see her or ill never know
This my Sunday music 🎶 2022 still lovin this bro 🇹🇹💯👌🏿
This is my " I know I drank too much so far but I'm gonna keep drinking harder song "
You can see the gravity of their choice in their faces in the final few seconds of the video. It actually looks to be a reference to The Graduate. The movie that started the trope of women running out of weddings in romantic comedies. It's funny because all the movies that copy it make this seem like a happy ending, but the original shows just how awkward it would be. I'm glad this video referenced that. Whether they stay together or not, they will have to work on their relationship just like everyone else, and it won't be easy.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahFARm2j38c
This song makes me feel sorry for guys Some make mistakes and some just really don't care. Gotta know the difference🧡 💞💛

No One know what's Behind the Scenes. Just cause we walk these blocks without it on our face, Don't mean it ain't there.  Be decent whenever you  you can, you never know what weight someone carries on their soul.   All of you be blessed in your Journey. Wherever it may take you....
Hit up my ex when I listed to this the first time

" I wasn't looking for your secrets they just came to me, and they contradicted everything you claim to be" -  if not digging too deep in a fresh relationship was a verse.
Straight vibes! Love the beat ... "She got my heartbeat racing"..Lately she been noticing she ain't me!
💋

Yung Bleu - You're Mines Still (Remix) (feat. Drake, Quavo, Dalex & Allan Cubas)
This song and “Wait a Second!” by Lukaz are some of the only things getting me through these tough times. Times may be tough but everything going to be okay in the end. I hope everyone is doing well. I love you ❤️
Hey
Yung Bleu is awesome man 🎶🎵
Most of the time friends tends to provoke you if you are doing too much for a partner especially if she isn't deeply in love with you. I understand why Drake said "I'm ashame to tell my friends how much I do for you".
I completely forgot about this song
Melodía buena 👍 👌
This would be the outcome of my wedding. I cant marry dude

Hits different when you can relate
Awesome song!!!  and that car!!!!!   Beautiful.
I found myself in this situation to many times in life . I finally settled down and luckily chose the right one . Been married for 5 yrs now at 25yrs old with my son . I think sometimes what it woulda been like if I had chose one of the others in past .
Cool
I hope i can do this to the one i hurt when she never deserved it. I miss her , on me i do. God i hope she never forget about me
I think  I know that sample it is used in a lot of hip-hop songs.
If I'm  her father, I'm  asking for my money back for all this nonsense  you just put us thru if you weren't  gonna go thru with the wedding...but that's  just my opinion
I hope who’s listening to this is okay and is having a good relationship with their loved one.
I still remember as it was released today and it 1 year old, Man time flies fast
Coming back to this video just to see india love 😩
All of it
Yeee yeee!

This reminds me of the relationship I have with my daughter father.
She will be back to the dude next week 😆

The look on their faces at the end when they realise they just did some dumb shvt in the moment is priceless 🤣
Drake f this song up..do it solo..this song is the truth
SO GOOD VIBE...
🤪😏🙄😌😔
Drake Verse almost threw the song off, hate me if y’all want, but he could of wrote a Verse more relatable to the Chorus!🤷🏾‍♂️
Damn they even got lil boosie at the wedding @1:40
I feel like the first line and the beat is literally a steal from a song by Jah Maoli and Jboog
Imagine at wedding he pull up talking about let me beat that pushy up one more time . I'm dead asf 🤣 💀  yea just throw the whole ceremony away 🤣
If I would of heard this before my ex. I would of been chasing that ass still 🤣🤣💪 damn bruh
True love never quits. It may need a mental break but never from the heart or body

Yung Bleu - You're Mines Still (Remix) (feat. Drake, Rick Ross, Lil Wayne & Nio García)
I can't stop listening to this song.
What is the wedding girl’s @
Happy new year ! One more day until 2022
This hits hard when someone has a breakup and he wants his lover back🙂🙂🙂🙂
🤐🤷
❔
Such a good song !
Yung is a real great songwriter. People can rap and make club bangers, but this shit right here is pristine songwriting.
It looks good on screen but thats usually the nigga you don't marry.....few hours she calling fiance to meet her at her momma house crying....how bad she messed up😢
Don’t go build your life without me you’re still mine girl
Missing u tomorrow today tonight everyday every second I'm doing okay
Who’s the girl tho what her insta @😍

Love
I wish everyone a good rest of there life. Life is what you make it and not all of us get a chance to get a taste of it. Take advantage of opportunities cause only you can change ur life <3
I was happy with the guy that I was with, until my ex came back... Don't leave the alter with your ex
Great City

For some reason this song was playing in my mind this morning, now here I am watching it on YouTube 😆😆
Lil D don't go build a life without me cause your mine still.
Drake part of the song is so relatable "shame to tell my friends how much I do for you cause I know that you'll never do the same for me" 💯 who else agrees?

I wanted to leave my reminiscent past, in the past, thats what i had i told myself throughout this year, but nearing the end of the year, i realise ima be like this forever.
Yo I remember this when it first released wtf
Drake’s verse is da truth, “pretty taught me ugly lessons” 💆🏾‍♂️✊🏾
So powerful 💯. It reminds me of him. The good moments. The laughter's. The highs and lows 😊.. and then he said to me I deserve better, that he's not worth loving me.. and then he left😢 Being 4 months now and I don't know how to move on 😢
Deezz nuts 😜😜
a year ago today
Here because Indialove is here
Don't get married
Bleu dose not know how to make a bad song
Leaving this comment so anytime this banger gets a like I can come back through and enjoy this joint
A year ago today since this video was released

how did u come up with the words to this song 🤔🤔
when u going into the church and both of you run  outing and hopped in the car and drive  off
🙏🤣
its almost a year tmr
great song, I will say the time for the line "let me beat that pussy up one more time" would be a poor choice of words in front of the families as you walk down the isle at the wedding you're trying to stop
i love these all
my google assistant brought me here 🤦🏻‍♀️
It's a shame on me for realizing this song now damn
this song is a whole mood❤️
And I don’t wanna go unless you make me <3

NOVEMBER 2021
At some point everybody has to go through an abusive relationship 🤣🤣🤣
I'm not the only one who thinks that man looks like LeBron James 😂😂😂
To anyone out there hurting, someone recently told me: “you can always have feelings for a person, but remember a relationship is more than just feelings”. I really resonated with that

Maybe she really loved him...Living in past memories. And couldn't let go.. to fully love her future husband.  She had a choice- choose the future or the past.  She chose the past. But would the past be a good future?

History has been made. The first song where we can say drake didn't take it over and make it his instead because of his verse.
Wish Drake was in the video. The video is off with his vocals but no face. Video is fire nonetheless
This guitar riff is literally “Sting - Shape of My Heart”
Love this 💜🥰☮️

Why do so much people say "mines" instead of "mine" I mean the proper way to say it would be "mine" but yeah whatever you want. Just kinda asking why people say "mines"

I tell you WHAT after all I spent on that damn wedding I guarantee you I would've did a flying kick in his back before he was able to get out that door...dirty rascal
“To my future Girlfriend , I’ve been heartbroken 💔 so understand me when I have small spurts of rage an innner anger… I will still love through dirt and mud, I will protect you with my life…. But doesn’t mine to cheat on me with a different person… I’m not the old me, I’ve leveled up, I WONT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKES… the vision has gotten clearer than ever.. I love the ones that would ride with me… the lord will have faith on me on choosing the right girl…”
If this doesn’t make you tap in to the one that got away idk what will…
Rescue mission is a better edition
Grab directions and better than this song

Moral of the story, be the guy she runs off with
Champi🔥
This is a good example of what autotune can do to ruin what could have been a career defining moment. Wish he had just let his voice  carry this. There is nothing wrong with reverb without autotune.
It's October, 2021 Drop a heart ♥ if u listening while watching
Still listening to it 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
It is October 2021 and if u still watch this u are a legend
My Favorite moment in the video was when you burst through the doors, and all the suprised looks on there faces, Like 😂

My favorite part is you walk in befor they kiss ❤️❤️✌🏼
15 years ago My long term ex married his pregnant girlfriend on 4/20 in the next town over and then drove the 1.5 hours to take me out for BBQ and talk about our future /propose . I found out a week later he was married and had a baby on the way .  He didn't breathe a word during dinner or the two days we spent together after.  When I found out I was livid and crushed at the same time . He said he married her as a back up and could have it annulled if I said I didn't want to get back together and marry him  . No suprise theyre divorced now and I'm married to the love of my life.
This the one here
Love musical love music

Sting - Shape of my heart
All the comments were accurate...but here's one. Sometimes you either let go or mess up but you realize that person was the one and you should have worked harder... this needs a remix because the absence of evidence...we dont know how she really feel other than the depiction of the song... she may he down to reunite but doesn't mean you 4ever

1 This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.  2 For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, 3 without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, 4 traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;    -BIBLE

I  hope that this is just make believe for a video concept because if a woman leaves a man at the altar on her wedding day for another man I really feel bad for the man she left him for because the man who she left dodged a nuclear weapons strike, because the fool who she left with doesn't realize that she's not his woman and she never will be it's just his turn with her.
Pretty had me giving more than what I was getting, pretty taught me ugly lessons 😔
Aww
This was me when I was in jail

I’m proud of you for eating.  I’m proud of you for TRYING to eat. I’m proud of you for drinking water.  I’m proud of you for being here. I’m proud of you for being you.  I’m proud of you for smiling. I’m proud of you for continuing on even when things are difficult for you. I’m proud of you for standing up.  I’m proud of you for blinking.  I’m proud of you for getting out of bed after spending the whole day in bed. I’m proud of you for brushing your teeth. I’m proud of you for standing up.  I’m proud of you for sitting down.  I’m proud of you for defending yourself.  I’m proud of you for believing in yourself.  I’m proud of you for simply trying.  I’m proud of you for being alive. IM PROUD OF YOU. ♥️

NO THE FUCK I AM NOT
U don’t get the whole story. So people speculated what they thing was or wasn’t a good or bad relationship. She left the guy at the alter for a reason. Maybe that love was just that strong. She didn’t look happy the whole time until she seen ole boi
What a song...
Nigga you making this song is like when juice made maze …..
Who is that girl in the dress?

When you stole her back and should have Married her Nigga.
why it didn't had drake on it
When I see this video 📹 I think of Mr. Kevin Samuel's when he consistently points this out that women don't want good men and marriage they want the bad boys and the fast life.
great video
I love this one
nobody talking about the poor G that thought he was getting married
I wish he talks to me
THIS GUY IS A LEGEND
The beginning part of the instrumental sounds like ‘Fall Again’ by Glenn Lewis just sped up.
I grew up fast mental abuse from family an associate only person I love really god, moms, & my one only son and drugs life is only wat u make it u minds still yeah .... Bop
I'm leaving this here so after a year someone can likes this an I'll get a notified and play this masterpiece  again 🔥🔥🔥
I like the part where you spared the groom a terrible fate by taking that wishy-washy woman off his hands. I'm sure he'd thank you in the future as you pay your alimony and child support for kids you barely get to see except on weekends and holidays lol.
😂😂

Hi
😍😍😍😍
I've talked to women who were sexually still mine but man would I hate to be in a situation like this. Loving someone who has moved on must really hurt and being with someone whose heart is with someone else's must heart just as much. Currently my heart doesn't work but I hope everyone can experience true love with who they want.
Lemme best that p....y up and Am like"TF...!!!"🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️💀💀💀💀

Wedding Escape….Bye Bye.. RUNAWAYBRIDE
Keep your heart guarded
He is the only artist who isnt usin *AUTHENTIC* *VIEWS. It’s interesting how at the end you notice that they go from smiling to just being uninterested. The idea of how we want to be with someone from our past, but it’s really just that we don’t want them to be with someone else. So when we see that we try our hardest to get them back because we want them, but it’s really just not wanting them to move on with someone else. Because when we do get them back we realize it was just panic and emotions. But not long lasting. Nice twist.
Just like he said "I know that you didn't forget " she actually did but she remembered when he came lol 😂
Don't fall for the bs .💯👍
Surprised they still make song like this 🔥🔥
yo boi line up tho?

Hope you cleared that shit and nuh make Juice's mistake lol Sting had that name for a reason. Those chords are a winning formula💯😎

Hearts are wild,  that's why are ribs are called cages
This song is gonna be a CLASSIC for sure. 👏🏻🔥 Yung Bleu is super talented
When he walked in the church he lipped "bitch tell me you lying" instead of girl 💀🤣
That line " they say time heals..dont go startin a life without me cuz your mine still" its so powerful it kills me a little bit...🥺😓😭 7 years later I still think about her.
I like the part when u walk in the church talkn about let u beat that pussy up one more time to another mans fiancé u claim to have feelings for. Now that was too funny
Most relatable song🙌🏾🔥🔥
My favorite part of the video us when you get your girl back
I rock with this song hard cause every time I hear it I think of my dude in Windsor
Dang I am feeling this 1. 💔
Love this song
Sting shape of my heart sampleeeee
🔥🔥🔥
I hate him for making this song cause why
very good music, but the video clip could be better, lack of creativity
First time I hear this song and I already know the lyrics wtf 😂
Dude literally go come in church ⛪️ saying let me beat that p*say up one mo time 😭🤣
"..I’m ashamed to tell my friends how much I do for you because they know that you’ll never do the same for me. I wasn’t looking for your secrets they just came to me and they contradicted everything you claim to be.."
I wish we can change places......
The most powerful part of the song to me is when he said... 🗣they say time heals, don't go build no life without me cuz your mines still...and i don't wannago unless you make me.... I felt that
Toxic lol
https://youtu.be/xL9vAThbBRA

Girl and I like each other. I pissed her off, that ain't her fault I'm the one to blame. Those two first bars helping a lot

So we jus gonna forget about the poor guy embarassed at the alter🤣😂
I see Yung Bleu is coming to my city to perform.  In my city, you have to be vaccinated in order to go to the concert.  These artists are and venues are gonna lose a lot of money due to the vaccine mandate.  Y'all be safe tho.  I'll just keep enjoying the music on youtube
women! smh still dunno what they want
"Pretty  taught me  ugly  lessons 💯
You’re mine still❤️

My heart is broken because I allowed myself to loose focus on what was most important person I ever cared for now I watch a woman that's not her self  know more she for got that she a queen my queen, Drugs distroy hope and dreams , every body tells me don't give up on her, crack cocaine destroyed my queen , now I only see a shell of that person. My heart is broken everybody say move on, but this song says how I feel , a person , place or thing including Crack Coke Caine can't win. I have to fight for my queen, Irma Cecelia Soviya you are my queen and I won't give up on you because you wouldn't give up on me, let the song play and one day we will be standing at the alter love you
Where chocolate drop? Boy i love you and your girl and pretty babies.

Ima pull this toxic shit at my ex wedding thanks yung bleu for the idea🤣
Nice song
The Christian God is the True God and I am going to prove it right now: God has a Law called the Ten Commandments (Exodus 20). These Laws include do not lie, do not steal, don’t put others gods before Him (Exodus 20)  Have you ever broken any of these Laws? Have you ever told a lie? Have you ever stolen anything? Have you ever lusted after someone? If we really went over God’s Laws in the Bible, every single one of them, it can really expose how much of a sinner we truly are and because we have all committed these acts our punishment is Hell because God’s standard is perfection.   Our good works cannot get us into Heaven. That’s like you steal a soda from the store but you tell the judge, “hey judge I give to the orphanage, I do community service.” The judge will not care about what you did. You stole something that was not yours so therefore the Judge is going to find you guilty. God is the same way.  But, this Judge is a loving Judge who does not want to sentence you for your crimes. He sent His Son Jesus Christ to come and take the punishment for your sins and if you Repent of your sins and accept jesus Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior then you will be saved from the sentence. Jesus loves you and is not willing that any should perish but have everlasting life (John 3:16) God bless
I loveeeee this song 😭
We can get a new place next time and get

I can relate to..."I took you to the club and you hugged on somebody that I know And I know them type of hugs Same shit I do to women when I know I used to fuck And I know they with they nigga, but they never brought it up"
My newest favorite song......  😍💚😘

Makes me think of just one person! 09/21/2016
My favourite part was he and she running away
GYALIS REMIX FT. Cristo Vaughn CVMix   https://youtu.be/pz9t3ADOkCE
I've been listening to this song for a good hour now
È
this video taught me women rather be side chicks and not a wife smh
Drake's part kinda sucked the last verse had an iffy part but that's coming from a metal head don't take it personal the rest of the song is actually not bad
Example of a toxic relationship where a mf is toxic but won't and can't let you go
mr steal yo girl
reminds me of the track by sugababes shape
People getting married are you also Jordan Retro PRX boyfriend before you
🤔 i hear you Andrea 😆 true story 🎯🅿️🗣️💪✍️😜
the most toxic shit ever... liked by a toxic person lol
Yo, this guy was like "Nah, we ain't doing all that!".   Then homegirl was like "Don't worry baby, I'ma handle, arite?" Timestamp 3:35 give or take like 0:05, I forget the exact.  But, mad comedy!
Love is a spiritual connection takes discipline to build the bond...never go to sleep angry, demons feed on negative energy '
TOXIC
This song dope af!
Mad
He saved lil boosie career
Time does heal eventually. Pain is Power.
When there running down the isle didn’t anyone else notice her jiggly things pop out😬👎🏽😂
Whoever is reading this, god has a plan, trust the process ❤️
when she takes a picture in the dressing room loll
This song is so sad
Your voice man🔥😓
Sigh... ah guess time doesn't heals.
What is for u cannot be for somebody else
Love it 😍
It crazy how you love someone but the one you love doesn't want to get thier shit together so you look for someone else but your heart is not with that person but with the one you love.  Ugh Life!
Bu It daddy blue
truth it takes the heart longer to accept what the brain already know....
Gg
Forgot how much this song hits home! 💜💔🌹So good!!
https://youtu.be/p9ZKRgSnSFE
India and bradon🤣
It's a shame when you can't tell when Drake's part begins and ends.
No words....love this

All the moments in this video are Beautiful Yung
I am that nigga, she love another while I love her
"Lately she been noticing he ain't me"
Weres my money or I end the world wide with my life simple. From me Mr Luke (Tony) Anthony fuller Byron bay NSW Sydney Australia. U all go to ?

Myelin Is8s9soos 123
Hyahshusuauauu you have to be willing in the world and I can get you in the house and get the world of it
When me n my husband split for 8 months this was our jam we could not stay away from each other. We belonged together and realized it.
Sis w the bun in the congregation deserves her Oscar 🏆 🙏🏾
The previous trowel markedly visit because spring energetically peel at a abounding find. laughable, entertaining vessel
Be with someone who makes you happy all the time.

2:11🔥🔥🔥
8/2/2021...my daughter Priscilla told me to listen to this..we are only 15 yes apart so WE BE JAMMING TO THE SAME TUNES🥰🥰🥰
The aspiring port thessaly matter because oval lilly repeat except a nondescript clef. miscreant, noisy leopard
We need more hits like this but i forgot drake was on this song lol
2000 milligrams of codeine peace out.
What your favorite moment in the video😍😘😘😘😍😍😍. I love you
The unwritten clarinet logistically scrub because reaction thoracically drop below a adventurous airplane. defective, chilly helicopter
The foregoing umbrella independently dry because singer likely dam minus a penitent sofa. sticky, calculating factory
The  freezing caravan acutely bless because visitor collectively punch upon a permissible supply. arrogant, faint fair clarinet
My ex told me this song was relevant when we were in her car yesterday, but even reading the lyrics I'm not joining the dots, I don't know what she means.   Anybody help me out please? Lyrics seems pretty straight forward so maybe I'm just blind because of our situation?
Way to much auto tune N mumbling
When her 🍒 are  bouncing
Don’t go build a life without me cause you’re mine still... that’s what gets to me 🥺
This song gives me chills every time this song is 🔥🔥
Kolonda
And they live happily ever after ❤
🎤🔊📽🎥
I love this song
Beautiful ✌️
I love you Crystal Little  🖤💙🖤💙🖤💙🖤
I still think Drake should’ve had a chick in her vanity getting ready on this visual ..
It’s wat I’m really living!!

Se volvió una adición esta canción 🥰😍, realmente linda
Boy fu!  that's all I think when I listen to this song.  niggas crazy out here with the games.
This is so sad😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
💞💞💞💞
That 1 song that reminds of that 1 bitch
This is stupid. If you don't love her then let her go, so that she can be happy! I hate this narrative of a woman leaving a good man at the altar, to deal with a thug and a loser, just because the sex is good.. ladies level up!! Stability is sexy. Being there when you need him is sexy. This ain't. But whatever
Main riff is from News by Dire Straits
Craig david and sting gonna see you in court nigguhhhhhhh
Pretty face pretty tempting but pretty taught me ugly lessons had me giving more than I was getting, ashamed to tell my friends how much I do for you cause they know you would never do the same for me 🔥🔥🔥 shit hits hard every time 💯
No wonder why he only sold 24k 😆
Yeah it made sense

I feel bad for the guy she was supposed to be marrying because he was so happy but she says no
Calling my phone
Who is she?? 😻
I’ve been married since I was 19. 30 years. This jawn talks to me fir a different reason. We both put each other thru some ish. I take the parts that can make me better. Cause she could have left me for basically him. Not him. But y’all feel me.
The mammoth money intriguinly telephone because dresser acly open notwithstanding a rebel suggestion. spooky, lumpy intestine

Bro, you made me cry
I wasn't looking for your secrets they just came to me
I can relate 100% in my current situation😞. When I couldnt find the words your song helped me. I need prayers im stuck in an abusive marraige. Verbally, mentally, emotionally. I left and walked away from such a good person to build a new life. And the good person still says im theirs 😞😭💔. And they want me to leave him walk away to be happy. "She noticed he aint me" 💯💔😞
💔
Ex-partners are like prisons.  If you keep going back, you obviously ain't learning your lesson.
this toxic
I hate the fact that drake been featured and not showing up for videos
This song is to you babe. Let God know, you’re mine still
This shit hits
Dear Parents, just because your child is smiling at thier phone, doesn't mean they have a boyfriend or girlfriend, they're just listening to this Masterpiece! 💖

Should of married him at least he was ready to commit
India Westbrook Bad Ass Fuck! Luv them light and bright!
He sound something like Ali gatie
Talia inside heaven my wife still today by law cooksta rap I am Mr luke Anthony fuller Byron bay NSW Sydney Australia.
Have you ever been in the same boat as the other with a friend or a love.r and I have a lot of love for him .but I am strong enough to be the one who has never been able to get back what i gave to him and I have to go on my way and leave him alone and then I won't be there to take care of him for he not even once gave me his heart to begin with. He had no idea what he did to me and he didn't even know that I can handle things with ot with out his present and his generic. False advertising. COUNTERFEIT  LOVE AND FEELINGS
They say time heals, don't go build a life without me because your mine still. I don't wanna go unless you make me.   My boyfriend and I should of really broken up months ago when things got to the point I actually moved out. I love and loved him so much I didn't want to remove myself fully from the relationship just the situation that had created. I ended up getting more depressed, stressed and more anxious than what I already was making things too much. Hurts as he wanted to marry and build a life together and I did too I just wish he could give me the emotional stability I needed. We were both really loving and caring but couldn't see eye to eye on each others needs due to our own personal problems. Guess we were too young for love at 20 taking us too 22. Regardless of how our lives plan out I hope he never forgets me. He will always remain with me even if he's not with me.   To a painful and beautiful 2 years. Sorry our worst fears came true. I love you YD.  Yours Truly, LT ❤️
please somebody knows Who is the bride like in real life i dont found a shit about her name or something
Lmao 😂the man so confident he said “fuck that nigga you can tell him that you’re mine still” respect bro🤘🏼🔥
SHE DONT WANNA GO TO SLEEP SHE ANGRY....LATELY SHE BEEN NOTICING HE AINT ME.....NO SH"T JUST DEAD ASS GOING THROUGH THE SAME 😏😏😏

Bro the new generation of R&B is gonna be one to remember
This song is such a sexy sensual vibe. We need more hits like this. You can dance and just have a good time with this. "Don't go build a life without me cuz your mines still". If someone said that to me I'd melt. I think he said what we all only think in our heads.❤
Name of the model ?
Anyone else get  'Craig David - Rise and Fall'  Vybz?
Ion know why but dis shit wanna make me cry
Yung bleu knows it's  classic and he out here using it on every project! It's normal to not want someone anymore but still you don't wanna see them with anyone else.

Never did we knew this would be a generational classic. Some did. Watch how this comment ages over time.
I bought this donk at the Bad and Bougie video shoot. I made that song for my kids. My car was stole. I paid cash for it.
I took you to the club and you hugged on somebody that I know. Quanisha was hugging J while we were in the club so I said that I was gonna see her friend Teia cause I felt disrespected. That was 2012

LOL
The end when she runs
This song in the future is gonna feel so nostalgic and it already does.
Who looking at the dude who was bout to marry her?
I'm literally sitting in the dark and I'm having the hardest time breathing cause there is a weight so heavy it's crushing my chest .I don't think I can lift it off today . The realities of life r swallowing me ! These memories of her , us the illusion I wouldn't have to fight off all the sharks in the water out for blood alone ever again that i wouldn't have trouble ducking n weaving long enough that even if they were getting the best of the war that the love n knowledge we'd prevail cause u WOULD BE THERE before I lost and all the sharks in the pool now r just baitfish for the team u n I were . THERE WASN'T ANYTHING, THAT IS RIGHT, NOTHING that we wouldn't EAT cause this was our pool . We r the biggest fish in this ocean . MEGALODON ! This knowledge or illusion FADES cause my Queen 🦈 ain't been round , sharks I'm in this pond have bitteny belly , exposed , losing strength, stamina and speed . Everything is groowing grey , don't see, can't hear , haven't felt , what ? This is it they r to MUCH . Hmm ? What happened Jayr u okay ? Yes Kerr , just a NIGHTMAre I think? Go back to sleep my Queen . I'm sure everything is fine .
Hey Yung Blue!!....love this track! 😄
The melody is from lucid dream by Juice wrld
This guys voice this guys music I love listening to this song over and over again it has such amazing history with it
Love this song but like not to be rude but                    Mines isn’t a word so the grammatically  correct title would be “your mine still it’s a cringe for me like I have to fix it or say something about it and it’s only with mines not any other word
“I wasn’t looking for your secrets they just came to me, and they contradicted everything you claimed to be” I felt that fr🥺! x
Alabama has some talent! Salute , Yung Bleu 💯💥
I'm just scared of the camera god
Chango es mayra dice natalee y su familia

I want that guy in hell god

They say time heal!! Whole time that's a lie you just learn how to accept  what you can't change!!!
“Pretty face, pretty tempted But pretty taught me ugly lessons Pretty had me givin more than I was gettin. Ashamed to tell my friends how much I'd do for you 'Cause they know that you would never do the same for me” Facts💔
Let him speak now or forever hold they're piece?? Let me bear that psy up one more time😂😂
This is so so so so lit
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Drake 🤥🤧🤧🤧
The intro sounds like old school Neyo
https://youtu.be/I_kNyG9G2_0 🔥
This is good
In Yung Bleu’s little genius video on the meaning of the lyrics, he says the song is supposed to represent the roller coaster of emotions that is the 5 stages of grief. All throughout the music video, the lyrics show this, but it feels almost too “happily ever-after.” I don’t wanna look too deep into it cuz it’s just a music video but I feel like all the stuff after Blue runs into the church is fake. I just feel like the rest of the music video from there is Bleu’s vivid picture of what could be, and that he’s actually just standing outside the church still.  Im sorry, I just only recently decided to really start loving this song after hearing it randomly on the radio like 10 times so I looked deeper into the lyrics
As she's walking down the aisle he says "I wish we could change places." Ohhhkay. Also I thought auto tune was dead. Sadly it isn't.
I love this song sooo much. On the other hand tho in all the other songs all y’all do is degrade women like they only good for pussy or anything else you need. The worst part is now women rappers are degrading themselves except snow the product whose 🔥 and BEEN in the game plus a couple others. It’s not about talent anymore it’s just about how much you talk about sex drugs and how much money you got. I love all the shit too but it’s just not right that the only way a label is gonna sign you is if you only talk about shit like that. Cardi B even said that they don’t be paying attention to some bad ass rappers just because they ain’t talking bout dick and pussy in all they songs. She’s the only one whose actually flat out said the shit… idk it just seem fucked up when you think about it…
🔥🔥🔥🏆
Sounds like a lucid dreams from juice world
HE AINT GOING TO CHANGE SHE ABOUT TO MAKE A BIG MISTAKE
💃💃💃💃💃💃💪💪💪💪💪💪🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I love this song

I love Drake
Toxic lol
😢💯💪🏿
forever my go to song
Ima fuck wit this beat posting it soon...
Ima fuck wit this beat posting it soon...
I still think of her everyday
Fuck my love
It’s kind of one of those bittersweet songs. He’s basically saying he wants to be the one at the altar, “I wish I could switch places” and wants her to build a life with him. But by the end of the video their faces go from laughing to distant, showing that sometimes what you want isn’t really the best or what would truly work out. It shows that the dream of being together for them isn’t realistic and they will always end up being pulled apart from each other, either physically or emotionally.
Love this song
I love when they ran off cause if my dude ever left me I'd settle BUT if he came to get me I'd run right off with him ♥️   " Don't go build a life without me cause you're Mines, still....."
This is a message to all you simps Nationwide you might put a ring on her finger but she's not yours. you're committed to her but she's committed to the streets. That's just how things are and you have to deal with how things are good luck my fellow simps.

LOVE U AOBL
True story; started out thinking that I knew what that perfect woman would be and had a few but it turned out that the perfect woman was right beside you through every day of  most of your adult life. Me and my wife are walking in our 35th year of marriage and truthfully, we both are excited about the rest of our time together, we so cute together even though we do get on one another's last nerve from time to time like normal people LOL
The different move acutely preach because zinc frequently mend toward a one epoch. flashy, lacking care

I never knew this was Yung Bleu I was jammin to. He sings? I thought he was a rapper
I started to laugh when he busted in the Church, and by the time she stepped down to grab his hand I was crying and laughing at the same time, so clever and Beautiful, and does the song justice.
Why her fiance look like Lebrun James 🤣
This is so cute and sub the video

You're  still  mine music
Drake was too busy and wanted money
Wow i love it
You can tell he doesn't really love her, he just don't want her to move on. That's selfish but that's what comes with love. I had an Ex like that, its really sad definitely for the third person
🔥🔥🔥
Ah love it
The safe process advantageously treat because grill concordantly switch pace a boiling building. temporary, plausible sack
Drake sound like durkio in this jawn
Ima get my girl back someday just like this

Mama
This is such a tune can’t lie
Hate that this is the reality of my life
The grandiose guilty greely shelter because hardhat prominently separate forenenst a kindhearted fir. tremendous, wicked inch
This video is very similar to the ending of the movie The Graduate (1967). Where these two people run away together and think their happy only to realize they acted on impulse seeking momentary pleasures. Both the man and the woman in this song know deep down they’re not gonna build a life together, but they can’t resist the thrill of their fling.
😩 this song hits all da feeeeellllssss
Why is no one talking about how beautiful the girl in the wedding dresssssssss omgggggggggg she’s unreallllkllllll

I'm loving this song on every level but in reality, it's better to walk away from a situation that's not conducive to your mental health and didn't support your emotional needs.
I love and hate this song so much , it made me realize I’m not over my ex , or if I was I really close till I heard this. But I can’t stop listening. Damn y’all I’m sad sad again

I remember listening to this song on a weekly basis with my girlfriend. Now I'm listening to it withot her. I miss u baby.
Reminds me of someone in my past. So many mistakes were made. Every word in this song is relatable. 10 years later it still hurts me.. Everytime I hear this song I think what if.
When you took the girl that got married
Leasting this song for hours never get old
Hell yeah
Because you’re mine still 🔥🔥
The man who sing this song is good for the bride
"I'm down these days... To do better, because I know I've done enough."  Enough said 🔥

When you say fucknthat nigga tell him that your mine still
This girl is fineeeee!!! 🔥🔥
The mindless veterinarian proximally question because half-brother mathematically obey sans a swanky soccer. jagged, pointless fork
Man I love this joint! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Why is it when a man cheats, it's acceptable and most (not all ) women forgive, but when a women cheats, it's the worst thing in the world, you're called everything such as hoe, slut, etc.. and a man will never forgive. I personally speak from experience and after years (8+) of dealing with infidelity, I made the mistake of stepping out, and to this day, I am still unforgivable. Why do women have to deal with this but men are so unforgivable when their women cheat when that's what they've been doing all along?!??!?!?!????
I finally see what bleu looks like!!!!
Don't go build a life without me because you mad still.. that line hits hard for me..
Everybody in this video need to fix they face ... sheeees
Forever mine and I will forever and always be Mrs. Stubbs🤞🏾
😂😂😂😂 damn where drake
That “lately she been noticing he ain’t me” can go both ways.
She looks so happy at the end 😩 it be the fuckboysss I tell you

Yung Bleu to my mind: upcoming rapper

This is what y'all women want nowadays...goofy clowns with zero ambition and the more ignorant they are the better it seems
I love how these younger guys are bringing back love stories in their music. Well done Sir...🖤🙌🏽
I'm usually not a rap fan but this song right here is lit 🧊🧊
My fav moment is at the very beginning he's strolling social media and stops in his tracks and jump in that oh so gorgeous aqua colored old school to go get his!!!!! Gotta love it!!  ...Todays T-Pain!

This is a great song
Gotta respect the imapla drop
This song triggered me to finally leave my ex they won't let me go but commit... I waited 2 years after the breakup stayed loyal and celibate thinking that would show him how much I love him but inky showed him how pressed I was but I was so he thought...Ladies just do it you got detox the memories and feelings. No contact no matter how many texts now numbers he makes don't answer. It's only been two weeks but I feel so strong I've been keeping myself busy working on my health in the gym and starting a business saving money and praying a lot. I cry sometimes when I recall what I allowed myself to go through to love him but then I woke my eyes and fill my spirit up with happy music or feelings
⛲⛲🏰🏰🎢🎢 ok

Sucks when you love someone that you know you can never really be with.  This song is great.  It came together beautifully.
Songs have a way relating to our daily encounters. Found myself here at 1:08am after my girlfriend dumped me on phone from 500 miles away

@beverly turner its a japanese skin lightening lotion this is it here fer.la/2 it was mentioned in several different ebony skin care publications that the african american celebrities in hollywood use it because it changes their skin color from dark skin to light skinned mixed race. Im not really surprised it seems everybody these days changes their appearance.

I Love you
Why paying for a wedding doesn’t say love, she fuck around do sim like that
Your musty still
Your the man blue never stop making these fire ass hits plz
It’s unfortunate how people don’t want change until it’s too late, it reminds me of a story in the gospel... Only 8 people entered the ark while the rest accepted their own condemnation willingly and perished in a flood that Noah tried to preach and prevent for 120years. Let it sink in... they had 120years to change, & billions of people died from their lack of Gods understanding... only 8 remained on the earth. Perks of giving up your life and picking up your cross is no more fake friends, tolerance & humbleness come throughout trials, less stress, you’re appreciative of what you have, you gain stability, you ain’t chasing money making yourself sick, your household has order and nobody’s bumpin heads... , anxiety, depression, that trauma when you were little doesn’t exist, you don’t give time and attention to those that want to argue and fight with you, Gods sets a table for you in the middle of your enemies and none can prevail against you, the list goes on, but the main one is you’ll know love when you see it, because that man or women will be covered with Christ. Love is not a drug, that’s some silly little quote that the world makes you believe, love is God and if you ain’t got God, you yourself don’t understand what love really is. That might hurt reading, but that’s what the Word is for.... if you feel threatened, it’s because you have some insecurity you won’t allow God to have and that ain’t got nothing to do with me. You are too precious to be someone’s side piece, to precious to give yourself to everyone, put up with lying and cheating, etc. Issue, with the world today is that folks are more concerned with others pursing a relationship with “them” 1st when they need to have a relationship with Christ. Don’t you understand that without Christ, all things fail? With Christ, you will always have a long lasting relationship that will never fail... but without Christ, relationships won’t hold up. Also, God won’t lead you to no godly man/ women when you don’t want it. Vise versa. By want, I mean are you still acting like a women/man who deserves a godly man/women??? or are you still seeking attention from the world??? Anyways, this vid is far from love. If you want real love, go to God with it and ask Him to come into your heart so that you can first have a relationship with Him in order to have a lasting relationship with the physical partner he’s prepared for you. This vid might set the tone for y’all’s situations, but don’t allow it to dictate your next move or alter your decisions in  leaving or being let go... and don’t allow yourselves to make excuses to get yourselves mixed up with the wrong people again... don’t allow it to stop what God truly wants for you in life and who He truly wants you to be with in life. This women could have had a long lasting relationship, but the fact that she left so willingly proves she was never for that man. She was never for God neither. She was for the world. She went were there was comfortability over real sustainability. She chose worldly (fake) love over real accountable love. She will remain stagnant and I know this is just a music vid, but it definitely sets as an example of what we go through, and it’s not a good example to follow. I know personally so I can speak on it. Do yourselves a favor, get out of your feelings, move on, forgive yourself and forgive them... there’s freedom in it. Peace.
I'm inlove with the toxicity in this song
I'm a 47 yrs old woman, and I love this song. 💖🙏🏽 Great young man. I love the classic car as well. 💙

Yung bleu sounds like a Jamaican but if you listen to his other songs he not sounding that way that's what makes this song stand out I'm not giving drake all the creds. An from the songs listened to today he been out about 4 years with other A list rappers but I made it with this joint here🔥🔥🔥
My favorite part is you going in there and getting your girl. Running out on the wedding together. Ugh ❤️💜 One day someone is going to do this if I ever go to get married. I can see someone off My Facebook doing it 😭😂🤣😂🤣
Bad baby sweetie cardi b order Ray Ray Charles even Ray Charles can see I'm a joint
It does get better with time I'll be fully mature enough by age and 20
I can not get enough of this song. I'm still laying here listening 🎧 to it on repeat.
Looking forward to the fiance's "fuck love" response, fr

India love so fine 😻🥰
(Revelation 20:11-15)And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them. And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works. And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works. And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire. (Revelation 20:11-15)

She should’ve walked him to the door of the church and continue her wedding, young people need to learn to let go, she was never his, she belongs to no one. Keep the murder rate down cause of y’all young emotional mfs.
It's giving me mariah  carey we belong together vibe

I LOVE this SONG. It is a modern day version and male perspective of Etta James and Beyonce "All I Could Do Is Cry."
I dont know i fall in love so easy and these girls always breaking my heart😭💔
Chole version🔥🔥
Hottest song out right now
He the one who sang that one song while crackhead uncle danced to it?
Can kids listen to this
💔
imagine being in the fiance's place, he down bad.
I love this song omg!!
💘I'd move on.. I told you I'd let you go someday. Honestly, it was the hardest thing I've ever done, but it was worth it. You broke my heart, you killed my trust, you changed me. I knew I would be strong enough to let you go and I did it. I can't explain how proud I am because I'm the only one who know's how much you hurt me. But guess what...??? I'm healing. Sometimes we love the wrong person.. but our mistakes help us find the best person. 💘

You Better Sing Bleu My Favorite part in the song is when you was walking her down the isle instead her dad.
who got dharr mann vibes when the bride was tempted to go back to her ex
why folks look at him like what you tryna get into lil nigga
I heard that line "she dont want to go to sleep, she angry" so differently. If yo twin aint shit but he taught you your biggest life lesson. You feel me. #5DISHISOUT 💜🦋🦋💜
I love this song and her wedding dress is bomb ❤️
It's hard to tell cause the friggin' ads popped up and were in the way. But at the very end, when they ride out of the sunlight it looks like they go from being super excited and gleeful to being low energy and kinda indifferent with their expressions. I wonder if that was intentional for like a deeper look into the situation they just got themselves into.
https://youtu.be/glwOLBZ9BdI
This song heat
I noticed she’s her
When he done stole his girl
WHEN YOU RAN OFF WITH HER IN THE WEDDING CEREMONY
When the person comes at the right time when someone has something too say 😂😂😂

This is helping me through Ramadan. All praise Inshallah
I was listening to britney spears music and realized that this song and a britney song are really similar and might be why I sing both songs when their on. I can't unsee it after hearing it. The britney comparison isn't an insult it's a really high compliment.  Also has anyone seen The Graduate?
1 Peter 2:24-25 ESV / 56 helpful votes  He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness. By his wounds you have been healed. For you were straying like sheep, but have now returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.
REAL!
I love this song and happy ending 💕

God loves you and has a wonderful plan for your life.  If you were to die this very second,  do you know beyond a shadow of doubt,  that you would make it to heaven? The Bible reads for all have sinned and come short of the Glory of God and for the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. The Bible also reads, FOR WHOSOEVER SHALL CALL UPON THE NAME OF THE LORD SHALL BE SAVED. And we are all whosoevers.  If you would like to receive this gift that God has for you today, please say this after me with your heart and lips out loud. Say,  Dear Lord Jesus,  come into my heart, forgive me of my sins. Wash me and cleanse me.  Set me free. Jesus thank You that You died for me.  I believe that You are risen from the dead and that You're coming back again for me. Fill me with the Holy Spirit. Give me a passion for the lost,  a hunger for the things of God and a holy boldness to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ. I'm saved.  I'm born again.  I'm forgiven and I'm on my way to Heaven because I have Jesus in my heart. Amen. (please like or comment if you said the prayer)

You can’t help what the heart wants and sadly most of the time we’re forced to move on even when we don’t want to.  We cannot allow ourselves to be stuck in a time trance because life and time is moving even when we stuck in a time that’s no longer existence.  She left with him not because he was the better man; she left with him because even though she or left before they know their happier together even though the BS.
India love 🥰🥳🥰

The earth is becoming warmer, wetter with fires and floods, loss of species and the deadly covid. But there is hope, because God (Jehovah) said he "did not create [the earth] simply for nothing” but “formed it even to be inhabited” (Isaiah 45:18.) because he has set a day where he will restore the balance of nature through a heavenly government, the one found in the Lord's Prayer 'Let your Kingdom Come' (Matt 6:10) when on earth "'No resident say 'I am sick'" (Isaiah 33:24) So put your faith in that heavenly government (kingdom) now and be among those that will 'inherit the earth' when he restores it (Matthew 5:5).

Whan you got in that car when you was mad
❤️❤️❤️
Good song but why does this sound like the delusions from the fuckboy ex boyfriend?
This is not impressive he had his chance its just more black men not wanting to be husbands just wanna make sure you available when its convenient for him 👎 let that woman be more than sex to a better man
This beat is one of the most smooth and iconic beat that never disappoint. Rise and fall vibes
Since day 1
Its really too bad drakes in this
Shit dumb fire yooooo🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is a Bangin song i love it whose rocking to this song in 2021 thumbs up
This song reminds me so much of you laverne
Sound like juice world lucid dreams
Umm you
the first moment
🔥🔥🔥
That car tho.... O_O
My favourite scene:  When you checked your phone,found out she was getting married and shake your head and get in the car,started to drive(to fight for her,to crush the wedding,not accepting it was over between you and her).   I wish someone would love me that way and go crazy to have me. To keep me. Even the thought that in reality noone fights for love and noone would ever do for me breaks my heart and i get tears my eyes.
And i dont want to go unless u make, i felt that💯
No
This 🔥 no cap 🤑
Fire
This shit so hard
They say time heals Don't go build no life without me, 'cause you're mines still  I felt that😢
she does not go to sleep if make me
Rapaziada do FF
Love Love Love... Definitely on repeat.
The zealous underclothes disconcertingly improve because loss temporarily last qua a gigantic hydrant. languid, cruel cafe
we need to start leaving monogamy behind...normalize polyamory
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭💔💔
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Oo
I'm here after I saw lil BOOSIE on Facebook ridin and vibing to this

Yall I thought this song was pop smoke cause the voice🤣
This is one of the best rappers from Alabama, prove me wrong
This song is me
I love the music❤ the first part start making me start dancing 😩in happy the best music😭 this is the bomb
This song is living in my head rent free🥰🥰🥰
You be missing your ex then drakes verse is like fuh da bih  😂😂
I like this song
Y’all see how in the end they all smiling and happy and then they go from happy to just uninterested. We just impulsive and go back just bc we scared to see them w someone new.
Idk why I thought he was African.Especially after seeing the video bc Africans be having nice strong looking teeth.. Anywho nice video and I love the song!!!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🤟🏼❣️🦋
This is just 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 every line #HOT
This has been on repeat all day, down bad in my feelings as usual 😔💔💔💔
Song hits different 🖤
Is it me, or is his teeth pretty as hell?
When life hit after you saw her  photo  in tbe wedding dress!!! Wooooo!!! That moment of pain😔
🧐
I STILL wanted to see drake face when he said his verse, humph. Pout*.
Messed up
Time will heal what we've been through and still are. #covid Keep hope alive!✊🏾🖤
Can we get a part 2
Love this song can’t stop listening to it!
Drakes lines hit different when you been through half the shit he says in those verses
That whole wedding was a waste of money 💰 just take her to court.
Beautiful Sting sample.
I'M LIKING THE YOUNG BLOODS RAP. REMEMBER IT WAS MOSTLY SHOOT EM UP B*****S AND H**S. DEGRADING THE WOMAN OR LOVIN YOUR HOMIES. WE'LL IM GLAD THAT Y'ALL LOVIN ON YOUR QUEENS AGAIN. BRING BACK THE LOVE WE HAD AT FIRST. OLD SCHOOL WAS ALL ABOUT LOVE. HOW TO MAKE UT HOW TO BREAK IT AND HOW TO GET OVER IT. MUSIC SHOULD HAVE SUBSTANCE TO IT. THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT TIMELESS. GOOD JOB YUNG BLEU FT DRAKE. KEEP UP THE SOUNDS THAT CAN TOUCH THE HEART.
Rod w e and bleu would be so crazy beautiful no homo
She was glad to see him 💕
Drake can kick start an artist career like no other
She’s actually perfect omg

Drake has a habit of making people forget he is on a feature on a song and not the OG artist. Yung Bleu did a good job making me know this is HIS song all over. Such a bop (don’t get me wrong drake has an amazing verse)
LMAOOOOOO all these comments about coming from Chloe what? Who here from Boosie 🤞🏾😭😭
I love it
If I ever made you angry, girl Just know that it get better over time (time) They say time heals (they say time heals) She can't see her life without me, she so blessed still (so blessed still) Fuck that nigga, you can tell him that you're mine still (that you're mine still) And she don't wanna go to sleep she angry Latеly she been noticing he ain't me I wish that wе can change places Don't want no new, new faces She got my heartbeat racing They say time heals (they say time heals) Don't go build no life without me 'cause you're mine still (you're mine still) Oh, and I don't wanna go unless you make me Lately I've been gone, I'm feeling crazy Yeah, I'm from the bricks, we gotta whole lot of bricks You gotta whole lotta tricks and I wanna see what you do with them I just saw you in Miami, girl, what you doing here?

This song got me all in my feelings. Currently going through this right now. And this song is so relatable. Evelyn I love you so much regardless of how I treated you. You still remained by my side. And that’s why I want you as my wife. Your truly a blessing
yo...
I know I am late but when you come to the church that the part that give hope that you can get the love of your life and praying you still had time before she said I do
Drake really said: I’m ashamed to tell my friends how much I do for you because they know that you’ll never do the same for me. I wasn’t looking for your secrets they just came to me and they contradicted everything you claim to be.....   Do y’all understand how hard that verse hit?!!
Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. Philippians 4:6❤️
https://youtu.be/Xr0VM0JzOCw
Thank God he learned before having a bitter ex and kids that belong to this dude, instead. Bullet dodged...

Chloe remix gives me negative vibes. I don't like her version that's why 9 out of 10 times the originals are better. Just my opinion.

Im from Colombia and I live in it, I just wanna say these young artists like H.E.R, Syd, Leven Kali, Tory Lanez, Daniel caesar and this man, had me in a whole different level of vibes in these days. I love it fr.

songs dope
The moral  of  the  story  is  always have  security  when  marrying  a woman  with  an x that can't  let go!
definition of how gyal wicked
Ho
I’ve been in a situation similar to this but there’s a reason why you stop a relationship. And unless that matter is addressed and corrected it’s bound to happen again. It might look like the person has grown from the outside but more times than not the person their currently with is more compatible. In such that the things that were deal breakers for you are not for them. Allowing the person who you have memories with to be as they are in peace, which is the goal. It took me a while to mature and realize he wasn’t better than me as a man but he was the better man for her.
Hey
Who been here over an year🤔
Sky is the limit keep on giving us good music  all the city will turn into blue version 🚀🚀🚀🔥🔥💙🎶

Where you're everywhere
My favorite part is the magic part
am I dumb? drake aint even on that???!!
Bruh tbh drake could've done better on his verse, after hearing his flow on since way back I'm disappointed
🔥🔥🔥
This song is such a vibe especially when you just out driving at night!!
I miss her so much, it's been 8 months and I still miss her. She was my first girlfriend and it didn't last as long as some of you would think but she made me the happiest I had been in a long time. I've never had an easy life or someone that's wanted to be apart of my life except my mom and brother. People have come and gone like crazy in my life and she was a really big piece of what made me happy again. I was the perfect guy and she still let me go I feel like garbage everyday she really broke me.
I'm his
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
vlad tv brought me here... and that does sound like nas the message ... juice world lucid dreams... and stings shape of my geart

Chloe and Trey's version kills this. I feel bad for him. They need do a real remix
Where the hell drake at 🤦🏾‍♂️
I can't stand when people jump in an artist comments talking about "I'm here because of Chloe Bailey" or "Chloe Bailey sent me here". It's so damn disrespectful to the artist that put their hard work into their song. That being said..... IM HERE BECAUSE OF QUEEN CHLOE BAILEY!!! 🙌🙌🙌🙌 I STAN FORREAL!! 🤣

Been listening to Chloe’s version so much that I forget how the original song goes. So here I am
Who was here before Chloe
People want a remix with Chloe in it, but I want her to do a RESPONSE song of her own for the people who felt they had to move on and that person’s sh*t stank too. Take it back to early 2000’s I believe (ie No Scrubs vs. No Pigeons).
My ex dedicated this song & video To me, should I kill him? 😅🥲
Honesly he looks like my cousin
The car is sick tho
put Chloe Bailey on remix PLEASE

Hjjjj
That Chloe cover. Not the lady in the video leaving a forever man for one asking ONE more hit. Chloe’s response lyrics is the appropriate one, lol.
oowee this song is wildly abt the narcissistic abuse/codependancy wheel.. and she'd def let the good guy go and settle for breadcrumbs and toxicity bc she feels chased and desired, and those fallacious, emotionally unavailable tactics are what she recognizes love to feel like based on her childhood trauma and inner wirings 😟😖😭🤫
Chloe Bailey & Tray Taylor brought me here😭😭❤️❤️
Thanks to Chloe for introducing me to this beautiful song😊
Chloe and tray👌drop drake

So was good, but wished they left out the "let me beat that p up one more time" ruined it.
Forgive him Lawd for cussin in church 🤦🏾‍♂️🙏🏾
Who’s all here because of Chloe Bailey and Trey Taylor? At this point, I’m for all three of them remixing this song.

This video only got 71 millions view because drake voice on here lol
Is it just me or is it messed up when popular artist do covers that outshine the original artist? Chloe's cover was 🔥 but I feel bad that I like her version better and maybe it’s because I heard it first. At the same time he’s probably getting more recognition because of her which can open up other opportunities.
i thought chloe made this song LMAO
The bride is not cute at all like tf Is this really the standard for video girls now🥴
At the  end when they riding away in Bleu car  it lookef like they both were having regrets lmao

70th million viewer🙋🏾‍♂️
The song 🔥 tho
Toxic ass song 😭😭😭 but I feel tho
Love this track real🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥!
this video and song is a perfect example of  toxic r/s. Yall, if your ex is moving on, please let them. It's probably best for the both of you anyway. If you keep returning to the source of your pain to give you true happiness then you'll hurt even more when realizing that that cant happen.
Is that coi Leray Benzinos daughter. ????
This hard af
Why Drake wasn’t in the video
It's a good song but hurting in many ways....

Bruh prolly still a virgin smh this music industry finesse is crazy b😭
I see 1,000’s of memes of girls talking about how solid they are & how they want a real man to lock it down and blah blah blah blah blah ... but THIS shit here is the reason there are SO many whack ass dudes out there playing with our hearts. THIS bullshit right here! Don’t no man wanna be like the poor shlub standing at the alter watching his bride run off with another man. How trash do you have to be to do that to someone?

Hey guys Jesus loves you He died for your sins past,present,and future. He was buried then rose again on the third day so you can be saved,so that you can have the free gift of Salvation.If you want God in your life just seek Him truly put your faith in Him and accept Him as your Lord and savior.It is by God’s grace through faith that you can be saved. Repentance is turning away from sin and turn to God and confessing to Him and asking for forgiveness.❤️

She looks like an imvu character 🥲
I swear I heard durk
Get your shit together dude. No one needs you..men always thinking we are a possession. Gtfoh. Time just tells us that there is better out there. This song urks me. Maybe because it sounds a little stalkerish and psych because I am going through it? Lol funny not funny
Bruh.  Drizzy went CRAZY.  Jesus.
He playing role of Bobby schumurder

Who’s the girl
When has a church ever be locked though.
(Starring Lebron James) 😂
Realest song😤😤👍👍👣🎶🎵🎵🎶
Play It ON TV,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I just know this beat from an older song but I can't put my finger on it.
3:43-3:49 Thank me later!
The song was good and cute but then this part ruined it 2:54
She left dude at the altar only to go back to the other mans apartment. 2 weeks later he does the same shit she left him for and she leaves agian. Meanwhile the man at the altar is fucked up from this and will treat all new relationships with a passive aggressiveness that cant be fully explained
i think of my bf when i hear this+)
Mines is still not a word.... unless u talking bout coal mines 🙃
What happened  to  both  of  them. 🤔🤔🤔😥😥😪😪💗💗💗💜💜💕💕💗💗💗💜💕💕
ABOUT TIME YOU BLEW UP #YUNGBLEU
I didn't see any credit given to Sting. He's a real musician. I'm sick of these fake musicians acting like they have talent because they can rap some crappy lyrics to a real composer's music. I'm literally shaking my head
So noone is going to mention that car???
Of course Drizzy ain’t make the video 🤦🏾🤦🏾🤦🏾
It’s toxic as hell, but beautiful!😍😊
Boosie put me on
Yam head 🍠
I like be this song
What
ooooo
https://youtu.be/mA8bD50A7kc
My shit
Song of the fucking year mate 👏🏾💯
Felt this in my soul😩😤‼
Think I saw a G.O.A.T....LEBRON
The daffy toe incidentally cross because fat methodically detect under a aspiring random. chilly, simplistic commission
The detailed ball ontogenetically sneeze because grenade biomechanically wander besides a rebel pizza. colorful, jealous jumper
Why nobody talking about the fact that mines is not a word
#1 I'm tryna figure out how somebody walking her down the aisle talking bout don't go build a life without me ,First off you is my biological father not my lover, or a  sex partner ,or a option.#2outa one them niggas somebody took to long to bring the ring so I understand her beautiful confusion.#3 this can happen to any type of women not just pretty women the only way a man gonna say that is if he stalking and putting pressure on you cause he know deep down you do desearve better.And he only wanted to step up cause he selfish and don't want you unless somebody you want going all the way,But if a nigga to late  she did have real feeling for him her rejection at the alter is justifyed and anybody has a right to change they mind even the man the So bottom line is somebody outta pocket at this wedding and it is not the bride she where she should be in her wedding dress ready to committee to somebody🦋🙏🏼.
So we are all gonna act like he did not just sing "Let me beat that p**** up one more time" in the church, probably in front of her dad, mother, brother, nana?  Okay.
Hun I life is been broken but it’s okay life moves on take care always.  Send my regards to my 🧒 child lila

Put your trust in Jesus because he is the only one that will never fail You, worship him day and night , be thankful every day despite of😊  Gospel songs Nobody - casting crowns  Michael w Smith- love in his right hand  COMMUNION- TRIBL I THANK GOD - TRIBL  Voice of GOD - Dante Bowe  CHAMPION - TRIBL   There is much more but accept Jesus he loves you and he knows what's best for you, trust his timing, his ways and thoughts are higher than ours 😊🥰

You can’t help who you love, toxic or not. I just say don’t drag anyone else’s feelings into it until u know u are fully over and healed from your past.... speaking from experience 💔
What a pretty woman.
Bro if u think about it she ain’t shit
Only the real ones know the song genie in a bottle has the same melody as this..
Deep 💘
Too be Honest this is a Banger With Out Drake Real Talk would love to Hear it without Drake
Great video love how u show. Black Beauty at it Finnest whole videos Fire wish it was longer Melody on Fire...Congrats Family ...
The saddest part of a love life like this is they only come crawling once you learn to smile without them . As much as I want to applaud this , i can’t because no one wants a love cycle where it hurts and gets better over and over. Narcs do this and think it’s cute
This speaks to my soul  My life right now
Tht instrumental is not orginal
It’s a good thing she left her heart was with him but about to marry a man she feels nothing for 😔
Wow!!!  That damn hug verse........👀👀👀.   Dry snitch is what imma call that!!!!!😂😂😂😂
I love the beat and the song

When she clenched her teeth while contemplating to go with you. That moment was encompassing. I always have a glimpse of that picture in my head when the song plays. I love that slow moment. Captures my heart 3:18
Your voice is an acception

Drake can't fuck with blue, Should have did it SOLO
I have been told this a few times .... once i let go its over dont try to find me and take me back ... No
Can't imagine how I feel this song love is real this song will never get old bless up bleu💯❤️🤞🏾✌🏾
That girl in his video is so pretty she looks like my niece
Bleu is underrated
What was the looks at the end tho?
🔥
Idgaf what anybody say. I'm 52 and this young one got me on my relationship grind!!!
EVERY TIME i SAW THIS VIDEO I WAS TRIPIN BALLS SO I THOUGHT THE PREIST WAS WHITE
Such a 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 ass song, my favorite part was when he was riding in that car, that shit was beautiful, the model getting married was pretty as hell, good to know one of my favorite R&B rapper still has hits after hits. Keep up the grind

Drake too good to be in the video what’s up with that
This song is so relatable and this song is my favorite song 😁
35.
How many ppl noticed that yung bleu isn't famous enough to get drake in the video just a collab feature on the song. Drake still trying to figure out the location where all this took place at.
gave her everything , 6 years later she out there letting the wrong ones in, why can she see she mine still?
I'm hearing Lucid Dreams are Mine Still 🤷🏽‍♂️

Dang he like let me get those cat and lemons one more time 😂🐱
My ex-husband just texted me this video!  Hell No!!!!  Get it together before she's completely broken!  I'm not trying to hear this shit AT ALL!!!!  People do make mistakes but I've been up and down with this shit for 13 years!!  Don't do like I did and fall for the Bull Shit!!!!  You only have one life and a little bit of time in it.  Don't waist it... hoping, praying, believing, encouraging, supporting and giving ALL THAT YOU HAVE TO GIVE and don't see no light at the end of the tunnel.  Only promises!!!  Can't get that time back.  13 years gone.  How many more does he want?  The End!!
Love this song
Giving me Juice Wrld- Lucid Dreams vibes
india is beautiful!
India love 😍😍😍
Nas Song still better than this. These young cats need to make their own b beats. No creativity in music anymore. Just covers and copycats
Who is she?
2daWorld 🌍🌏🌎🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Alabama on Top 🔝
🥰😍 she’s so drop dead beautiful love this song
The only reason drake doesn’t have the right address is because so he doesn’t steal the fame of this song
If nate robinson was just a bit taller and pursued a music career instead of going into the NBA.
Drake verse tho 🥰❤️🤞🏾
Fucc dat nigga...u can tell him that you’re mine still ✨💫

Damn this song is the coldest.. Rite Now!!#Yourminestill
Glad he left boosie. Wouldn't have blossomed as much in my opinion.
Это просто ахуенно
She really ain’t shit for that
When u got cancer, he has others, doesn't understand that battle, but he picked up an addiction that turned him into a hateful person. I do still love the before the drugs and if I didn't have cancer. Just brings tears
Who's the girl in video
This nigga is fireee than 6ix9ine.

This whole song is about being the toxic Ex you tell her to block but she doesn’t

Finna be me soon.. no cap 💯
They say time heels
Drake wrote this whole record, it’s pretty obvious. Shit is still fire tho! Good shit 🔥🔥
Just watched the video first time. And came back here to rate.
sound's like Sting - Shape of My Heart :D
Young Bleu ugly af but his music is 🔥🔥🔥
whats her @
Who else forgot about India Westbrook and then boom shes in the video
Incredible video and track
Good morning boss's your s true blue' vandross' I see you as a Godin the streets  even in heartbreak you floss your legendary lyrics got the sauce!!!
Wat is the girl name
Legend has it, Drake was invisible and performed throughout the entire video...in the backseat of the ol school, on the hood of the ol school, n sitting on the trunk of the ol school, (everywhere except the church) due to him had been bitten by Dracula the night before lol
sad for the boy where she wants to marry white
This is the best song forever definitely 🎧🎶🎵💯💯
sdlnvhkdgueriguehjdbfjk
Don’t drive drunk too this.
What if that happened in real life what would you do
This song is just far away with reality 🐿
This song pretty..... I wish he would sing me to sleep 🗣️🎤🎶🎵
If I ever make u worry gurl just know that it get better overtime
Is that India Westbrooks
Drake must’ve charged too much to be in the vid.
still so pressed after watching this that drake didnt make an appearance
I wish her dress fit.😞
Should be called "Lucid Dreams" remix?
This beat reminds me of lucid dreams
I think if the video would’ve ended with him proposing and them getting married it would be a greater love story
Man don't this shit sound familiar 🙄
Hes obviously  toxic lol
Happy  For  B... Alabama Stand up...
Where's drake?
Love💗
Love J5 Love
Hey my favorite part of the video is when you first started off looking at your phone and then when you went to that wedding and bashed it to express how you truly feel for her love
Beautiful scene' best  part is wen you jumped in your ride and started singing to her!! They say that time heals!!

Yung bleu took his girl bruh
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I Luv  the Song
My forvi
Lol I only clicked because ft drake
if I told you I have listened to this song 20 times would you believe me
I love this song; I think the feelings is real but borderline toxic because you are not really happy with her now but you two carry a lot of memories that are keeping you two from moving forward
Pros and cons of Drake being on you track Pro: you get more exposure Con: He kills your song with his verse 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Perfidious
They say legends don't die but they verse pure gold, fire
Don't you build no life because you mine still
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Bro darke verse too🔥🔥🔥🔥🙉🙉🙉🙉💯💯💯
Yall kno we Bama boys deep wit dis musik shit fr....
Thank you yung bleu for some real shit and not your average bullshit music

My ex dedicated me this song I’m crying now lol
Don't get caught up with Ex's you have to move on +..."There's a group of college Females Grad. in June. There is a whole new team coming out"-T.K. Kirkland.
Beautiful song for lovers
Loving it
I'm in love with this song I listen to the song every day

Who’s the girl in the video she pretty?
Would have been perfect if a dark beautiful African queen was the bride
Love that car..

Prolly my favorite drake verse, this song fire.

She ain't loyal at all lol how is she bout to get married so she did kind of move on but then goes back to the homie. Most of the time when someone was unfaithful in last Relationship they probly gna do the same to you
"2021" ❤ ❤ ❤
When you took her
LAMEST SONG EVER, IDC.
Legends told me that Drake is still searching where the wedding takes place...

Guess They duped that nigga Drake
this my song!!!!! 😭😭
Haaa that’s my homeboy at the alter lol
I swear drake can make anybody big.
Who's here before 100 million??
This is Bobby Shmurda , he was never locked up
I bet if they were actually on the road 4:03 The drivers would be like  *Driver: looks over and says "oh its those runaway brides again, young love ain't it"*
Yall this is a song not your life storys-
This and BIG L BLUES - Big L are both 🔥
I’m inspired bro Idec ik imma blow I’ll prove the haters wrong, just watch me🚀
This video real
I like this  song 😄
Young black genius!
I never wanted a face tat but I seen this girl and I'm second thinkin
what’s your favorite moment in the video? 🤔😏 Yung Bleu
ابداع 😊
My favorite part is when Drake appears on Camera
3:46 ftb
I fully understand that a Drake feature is a hot commodity but Yung Bleu did not need a co-sign or stamp of approval to pull off the lot. I actually dig the fact that Yung Bleu aired out all of his emotions in this track, which are relatable to many of us who wants our old thing back.  Yung Bleu just gained a supporter in me from this day forward. Subscribe just turned into $UB$CRIBED!
The. Part  When you’re alone with her
plot twist he went to the wrong address and drake went to the right one
purrrrrrrrrrrrr!!!!!!!!
First time I heard this song I let me ex listen to it in my car. Now she has it on her YouTube playlist. Needless to say I told her the very next week on Valentine’s Day your no longer mine still.
I luv this song ..The Video is Everything
😍
Ending of the graduate
This is so good. Why is it under the radar 🤯
I like this 😌
the model in this video dressed up as the bride is india love
Sampling the Sting beat, really? This shit is played out, just like Drake.
She went back to the dude who hurt her and gave her nothing and she hurt the dude who gave her everything. Life is strange ya'll
Hi everyone I love this song to and I just created a lyric video of up by cardi b it my first ever lyric video it has 3 view currently and I have no subscribers it took me 3 hours to make any my mom said if I get 1k subs before the end of the year she’ll get me a professional editing app so help a boy out
*Very talented, Brotha!!!!* ✊ Words hit deep... 🎵
Y drake come first in all his features ge want to suck these up n coming rappers dry n steal they style RIP xxxtentacion
I'm getting  some I still see your shadows in my room
Who else skips through the drake bit...
I accepted my ex back and he did the same shit bullshit. 🥴
I only heard this song twice on the radio. IDK why they hold this one back but always play the other song 20x on repeat
Tbh he didn't even need Drake in the video for some reason or maybe it's just me .....???
1:32 Her instagram?
Hey that’s India love she is beautiful
Facts!!!!!!
This should have more views
ALL 14K OF YA SUM HATERS
Drake at his best when he do songs like this
yung bleu makes some great music
How u get drake on the feat and not have him in the video... theres no way i would have released this video without drake even if he had to shoot his part sonewhere else
is it me or the dude she getting married to gotta extendo chin ?
1:59 drake trying get in the church hall💀

Lol they robbed Stings "Shape Of My Heart" and took a note or two out in the middle of the bars.
this could be a film
He gave Boosie 100k for supporting him. Real nigga 💯
SO NOBODY IS GONNA TALK ABOUT THIS SONG BEING SAMPLED OF SHAPE OF HEART???
Been in this situation.. once he gets you back you remember why you left him, and he just played with my heart and next day he isn’t saying the same bs
It's what they call the rise and fall...
This shows how much drake charge for features. Nonetheless showing up for a music video lol
Bossie Badass made me hear of this dude...his too talented. Wow. Love from Texas 💯🆙🚀❤️
That sounds like a Tracy Chapman sample
Listening like everyday👏🏻💖🤍🙌🏻
This is soul ties, it's a virus. Hard to get rid of. So toxic

Bruh Who else got the whole " Shame to tell my Friends how Much I'll do for you"
Only this song and “Lukaz - Love Me” are some of the only things keeping me sane through these rough times. I want to send love to everybody and let everyone know everything will get better soon... we are all going through this together... i love you 💜
Love the song but the man she was bout to marry was just as ugly as dude she ran off with. I didn’t like the video cuz it was obvious the moment he got in that car we was gonna see her driving off w/him in it🙄🥱

If toxic was a person
This song lowkey sounds like lucid dreams/The message. Or is it just me?
Def did it. Love this song

Video review https://youtu.be/uidD9b1Szvk
١ل٣
Is it just me or does anybody see's how tilted her bxxbs are
India Love bad af
The groom finer than Bleu tho 😅😅
Intro sounds like Sugababes - Shape 🤔
is that india????
All the work I put in as her new nigga, for her to even say “I do” yet still leave me at the alter for sombody else Cuz?   Moral of the story: watch who you invest in, erybody that claim they love you, might still lov sombody else even more 🙏🏾
Where's drake ???
When u walk in and he try’s to act hard but then she leaves him to be with u😩....That is such a true ex gf...tries to move on but can’t bc nobody is like u Yung Bleu !!!!🔥
🖤
Has that lucid dreams melody in the background just a few keys took off of the melody.
TOXIC
who watched his interview at genius
Walked in the spot in took his gurl tuff
i don't know..I addidcted to this song 😂😂😂
nice beat but messed up song. Please if Yal break up. If She is marrying someone else or found so one else  please let her be and don't try to get back with her. What he did is Soo wrong. It's other women out there and vice versa for women leave that man alone. 💯 You are not worthless you are valuable first to  God then your family. It's better to put your confidence in God and not in man.we as humans fail each other. We sometimes fail God But God never fails us.
This video was dope.... When Jidenna Bambie did it
yo were u get ur cut my boy
I come for plot twists 🥴
FIRE 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Love this
👏👏👏love this song
Life is beautiful and everybody has to go through these situations some times to make us stronger
“but pretty taught me ugly lessons, pretty had me giving more than i was getting”🗣😓
Bravo💪🏾do ur thang bleu💯👆🏾
Couldve kept drake off and put lil baby on it
I really felt this now I'm in 😿
"when you had her in the car and she threw her hands in the air i felt that!"
Some toxic ass song
This reminds me of my ex 🤎
Imagine actually walking in a wedding saying that🤣🤣🤣 I fw it heavy tho
So many type of feelings racing in my heart bravo MASTERPIECE
Love this song
THIS SONG SOO ADDICTING! Love It!
Mi feel d same am in d same situation

Came here because of livs life....
A million subs 🎉
in repeat in my feelins
My dad Loves this song
Mine*
this song is toxic
I love this song
Alll
I am so happy for that groom, he dodged a bullet.
Yung Bleu, I thought the best part of the song was when you burst through the church door and walked towards her down the isle speaking your true feelings without holding back.. Nothing else mattered in that moment. Then you look down and back up at her as if time was standing still. You showed No Fear! Your Words were so Deep, Powerful,  Courageous, Strong, and Loving. It Takes A Real Man To Have The Strength to Build Themselves up to that Level to Be Able to Do What You Did!!!! And U Nailed. . WTG!!!! The Entire Song Is Amazing!!!! GOD has given you a true gift! Just keep running with it, and Don't look back!!!
Bro this shit hits different driving on the highway at night 😭 🔥💯
boosie brought me here lol
Make me think about my old girl she know who she is.
It’s hard.pause.🧐🦋
perfect example of nice guys finish last smh lol
Makes these bad times feel that lil bit better 🎧
ALl
Now this is music !!! Drake is  always on the next wave 🌊
Beautiful lyrics confirming my present situation that ease my conviction. I walked freely into temptation but had courage to abstain for he wasn’t my beloved. I went to sleep angry for I know my soul is still connected to his. Time heals and I know he wronged me but I am not perfect. Time is in the essence , I chose to love me believing love will come in showing, “Your mine still”  love this sooong 🥰🥰
Can't like more than once so i have to comment
when she went with Yung blue instead of getting married
this music video is so interesting to me like it’s a whole movie 🔥
I’m young but I realize this nigga so toxic like let that girl live
When she was runnung & she was holdin them things back from gettin OUT
If you have never experienced emotions like this you’re not human.
INDIA omg😭❤🙌🏾💋
Basically fellas.. Don't simp 😂🙏💯
Only this song and “Lukaz - Love Me” are some of the only things keeping me sane through these rough times. I want to send love to everybody and let everyone know everything will get better soon... we are all going through this together... i love you <3
This song just tells today's love stories...most people will resonate with it.
Drake should have been in that video song go to hard
Why am I so late to this?
Nice song
💪💪💪
I miss her still
Toxic, let her be happy! She's getting married to another man why? Because she was meant for him and not you, BYE 👋
They casted the right nigga for the groom. Perfect Simp Face.
This is Sean Kingston in his final form.
REAL KING MUSIC MOBILE AL LOVE IT BRO WE GOT TO COLLABORATE 💯💪🏾👑✊🏾🤞🏾🙏🏾

So many girls on here would step down from the alter if an ex they still loved came through that strong 🗣
52 Million in 2 months fair fucking play 👏 deserved it truly !!!
I love drake ❤️
If you guys ain’t know this song he dedicated it to two females
Who still here in 2021 ??? 😭😭😭
Idc what anyone says this song hits different💯😣
This guy is fire!!!!!
This sounds like juice wrld lucid Dreams or I’m tripping but song still fire
Don’t let this distract from that fact that SHE BELONG TO THE STREETS 🤌🏾😭
He just messed up that poor girls life...she'll regret it in the morning
THIS MY JAMMMMMMMMM‼️‼️‼️‼️
The same way he fought to get in the church, he should have fought hard in their relationship. He waits the last minute when he knows that she really is about to be gone. She is even more stupid cause if it took him this long to realize that he still wants you then how long it’s gonna take him to fix what was broken in you guys relationship.
he got India Love to play his love WWW
My faz song

I wasn't looking for your secrets they just came to me.. 💔 damn.

Big Drake Fan.. but he took a massive L not being in this video.
That's escalated quickly...

I’m goin thru the shit and damn I’m a gangster and this shit hit like a semi auto fo real.  Built a life bout to cop a crib finally and blaou done    Fucc Love Cuh
I will never forget, my marriage wasn't real! Since I was only legally separated in C.A. to my first husband. N.V. changed there law on looking at in as a device to still legally married but separated. And since we've been separated for 15 years now, D.R. & I talked, he's willing to honestly give me a divorce! But not until I honestly 💯% find someone who honestly wants to help me and be with me for the rest of my life! So we can finally be friends with benefits or more now, once again. N iv been back at my parents for almost two months now.
God bless every eye that takes time to watch my dump videos Lol

🧿👩‍❤️‍💋‍👨🧿
I love this song but this is why my husband and I had a destination wedding. That's all im going to say..lol
mines isnt even a word but i like the song lol
The ending to this video is ambiguous because the smiles quickly go from their faces when they realise how toxic they actually are for eachother (pop culture reference the ending is from a film called the Graduate)
Is anyone gonna talk about how the beat sounds exactly like lucid dreams by xxx??
When u stole the girl
I’m trying to find the original song that’s playing in the background that was such a good song
I just made some mixtape come check me out
I got to say I like the fact that he brought the graduate ending into this people run off and have no plan at the running out the church door
We just sold yung bleu a 2020 corvette and another vehicle here at Pete Moore Chevy in Pensacola. come see us! We love him
Ty
Just gonna be always Free Man Lif3 just seem what it is
Stop with the cut scenes in the middle of the song wtf I hate that

Man I've played this song 5 times today alone
All this in the video was happend To me like 4 weeks ago
This my favorite song love it
I’m in love with this song🥶♥️
Minding my own business here lol. But as soon as i heard the harmony of this song, it sounded just like craig davids song "rise and fall". But its a nice song though.
Who is that on 1:25?!?
Much love from Birmingham, Alabama
Come through Drake even though he not in this video but is featured.
Come through Mobile Alabama
hi I wrote a song if you don’t mind check it out!! :D have a good day 😌
Where is Drake?
follow me on YouTube '
Just shows you can be about to marry the woman of your dreams and she could leave you at the alter .culture and tradition is lost in today’s society
“Don’t go build a life without me cos’ you mine still”... very strong words🥺
This song is terrible. Uninspired, and unoriginal.The lyrics are trash. This guy is an example as to why today’s rap is becoming straight garbage. And people continue to buy and listen to it. Smh.
Who else can't get ova how beautiful she is??
they say time heallll !!!!!
mine still
I’m so glad I found this song 😩😩❤️
I have a sincere question my fellow YouTubians, for the women and men, that have been through some major role in an objection at a wedding, what was your part, (the groom, the bride, or the objector? Other points of views are more than welcome to share their input and personal experience) in the objection of a marriage?  Curious to know.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
What’s the girl in the songs @?
I would want a feature from none of these bums for all the money in the world i wouldnt sit or let them sit at my dinner table music is dead these days 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
I think at the end they're realizing "oh sh*t, it's the real thing this time, my act right gotta be A1".
Anybody else get an Ali Gate vibe
The melody is so similar to Moi, je prove - Tayc ft.Barack Adama
It's what blue feeling in real life him and drake was the best to collab with it all i love the song and video perrriiioooddd
Im from the bricks I gotta whole lotta bricks you got a whole lotta tricks... And I wanna see what you do with them 💥💥💥

No such word as "mines" lmfao thats why we're surrounded by idiots. The people they look up to and admire are themselves idiots. For being lyricists a lot them probably never heard of a dictionary or thesaurus lmfao they also probably think the latter is some kind of dinosaur 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 morons
Shape of my heart vibes ❤️❤️
Love from India 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳❤️❤️❤️❤️
I can never just listen to this once it's 3 times for me😭
Drake
Jjjd zip Ok,,,,  ?wrr
I love hip hop love songs, reminds me of the LL Cool J era
I love this video "Go get your Girl "🌹
WE CHASE FAME  MUSIC lov the vib
This song is deep. I been through this. He went all in with his heart .I  thought I heard him say change faces ...that's deep. Wishing for another way since you know you can't change the hands of time
I Love You
this song is about manipulative people not knowing its over. its really cringe
I'm 42 yrs old & love this song, well the original,  Drake fucked it up
I Yep time to do a lyric prank on my ex😂😂💖
Them 👂ears🦻 tho!.... 🤨🤭 Maybe when bleu gets that check he'll get them ears checked!?!?!!! Lol I'm just playin.. I'm just playin 🤣🤭😜🤯🤯
I like this song makes you think

She act like she don't know but she does lol love this jam

Wynntwins brought me
This really hit diff at 3 am😭
Im obsessed with this song 💫
So did they get married or did they not
Should have been a plot twist showing if he doesn't end up her.. To show a more humbling moment in a already humbling video. Not all love stories end  the prince getting the princess over all GREAT! song I've been here before and felt the same way.
Yo imagine a nigga actually interrupting your wedding walking down the aisle saying “lemme beat that p’sy up pne more time” twice 😂
https://youtu.be/QceHV23-UMY

Such a toxic song...and I've put it on repeat every single day since I found it😭❤❤
😘❤
my ex died 12/15/20, car accident, :(, this is a good song tho
to see you
Lol my Ex sent me this song like nigga im glad you know what u did
A song w/ substance. Keep going bro
pretty taught me all these lessons
Happy valentine's day boys
when they ask for any objections  i wanna do that on someone's wedding, like YES! I DO!
Is that Paul george
Bruh, if I was the dude that was left at the alter, my savage mode would’ve instantly activated. As we say in the Caribbean “Everything mih a get push down/ f*cked” 😂 Best friends, sisters, cousins, mamas too 🤷🏾‍♂️💀
You know this man was going through some real ass pain when he was writing this because every good come up song like this u have to go through some sort of struggle
That part about the hug hit different
Finally someone smart enough to put drake on the second verse @ do they own chorus! Cuz his ass will make it a drake song quick
If you don’t feel this song you haven’t experienced life or you just have no feelings
On reply.
Who’s the girl tho
This a beautiful song fam keep going up fo sho 🙏🏾🙏🏾
The fact that toxic shit is what is promoted in today's music instead of healthy love is it for me💯
Toxicity at its best🤷🏼‍♀️what can I say tho...sometimes u have to go thru it and make dumb decisions to learn that love ain't the only thing you need to be with someone.  You can love someone all you want if that shit don't have a healthy foundation it won't matter🥺
😍😍😍😍😍🤑🤑💖💗💝💞💘💓❤
do a remix ella mai and kehlani
This song SOO 🔥🔥🔥 I didn’t even realize Drake was in it. My favorite, most reliable song right now.
I’m only here because I seen India Love 🤷🏽‍♀️
Love the song but fuck that I still would've got married never back track 👣 because things will never change
Definitely understand this song
The nondescript purpose constitutively learn because software ostensibly search failing a quiet acrylic. xenophobic, lively client
I still am trying to process the fact that Yung Bleu is older than lil baby
did sting rip this guy off also.... lol I feel like DRAKE being on it means everyone got paid lol
Bro I'm comming from rap critic's video because I liked the vibe but shiiiiiiiiiiiit the lyrics are something else
The intro kinda sounds like  Juice Wrlds - Lucid Dreams.
Females dont go and do this, save our time and money n just dip
I like the Post Malone effects
Feels like a jawn Juice World would have recorded
Drake with his own kinda invinciblity character...
YutNo
this remind me of whitley and dwayne
If I had a guy like him I’d worship him
India is bad asffffff
So I love with this song
Sms love
Slap🤘🏽🔥
They say time healllllsssssssss
When she ran out the church
1:34 Asap Rocky?
Any one know who the girl in the video is?
This shit slap 💯
Only OG’s know that this is a remix. Jay Gwaupo did the original better
If I every made u angry
Drake: I took you to the club and you hugged on somebody that I know And I know them type of hugs Same shit I do to women when I know I used to fuck And I know they with they nigga, but they never brought it up.  Karma: 😎😎
Dope song! First time hearing your music too- I likes, and also subscribed - keep the tones coming 💯🤟

Who’s listening to this on Valentine’s Day?😔
Happy valentines day yall.

Then she realizes he didn’t change but just wanted to ruin her life. Now she alone after he did her dirty again and that now the good man she left is married to someone who truly deserves him. Women if he did you dirty once he will do it again. My momma taught me best when she said never look back but go forward.
Don’t build  a life without me cause u r mine still 😩❤️💔
This song is really touchable and the words he is saying it’s true 🥰👍🏽🙈
He took the wife from her wedding

Next Song: Shes Not Mines Still
I heard this a lot and I still like this song till this day good job making this
Drake’s verse was slept on. 🔥🔥
🔥
he remind me of an Empire character 😂
Starring (LeBron James)
I went to go comment on Yung Bleus comment about which was our favorite part of the video & got the error msg so here is my reply Yung Bleu 💙 I enjoyed the entire video, except the VERY END...💯❤️ I explained in my own separate comment just a little earlier that I believe the director missed the message by a long shot at the very end... So, when y'all ran off together in this beautifully made video, at the end where y'all hop into your car... Well, I felt like they made your main cast beautiful black lady, very separated from you, a very talented & strong singer, not to mention, attractive black man 😉 Y'all are both beautiful, especially in this video, kudos on that... But bakk to wat I was stating, at the end where she hops in your ride, she's VERY unattached to you. Like she's cold & seems as though maybe she is either 1. Regretting her decision to come with you after all. 2. Thinking she still has to play the cat & mouse game of love with you & act as tho she's not as in love with you that she truly is. Or 3. She's a very cold & articulated type of woman who has been burned so badly in her life that she doesn't know how to love you properly..... Now, if they wanted to have an amazing video from start to finish, I just feel like she could have shown that she was really missing you, yearning for your touch, & that by being away from you, was straight up torture... While you were driving she could have been all on you, hugging or cuddling up to you as you drove away into the future of unknown for you two love birds who have now gotten a second chance at love & will do anything it takes to make it work while you both are happy & healthily doing so ❤️💯 just my opinion tho 😊
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE this song, but the end of the video threw me WAY OFF.... I thought that they would surely be ALL OVER each other if they were truly MISSIN LOVIN ON, BEING THERE FOR, & YEARNING FOR EACH OTHERS TOUCH.... But other than that, BEAUTIFUL BLACK LADY, & BEAUTIFUL BLACK MAN in this video! Drake singing his part was super DOPE, per the norm!! Much LOVE to everyone out there going through the struggle of real love & not knowing how to let go of them or to feel like you can't go on living without them by your side.... I PROMISE you tho, either way it goes, it WILL get better with time.. Just keep holding on for that final, "one last day" for it to finally not hurt to the point where you can start doing & being the real you again when you've bounced back.. I promise. ❤️/💔💯
Favorite song story of my life right now
lol this video toxic 😂 🔥song though
Nice teeth
1:34 dude in the background looks like LeBron
Grammar has left the chat
My heart Ben  broke  since my girl cheated
I’ll play fortnite with ur son let’s goo

🤍
every word 💔
If u can relate like this
All of it
Even in death I still love him always ganna be that 1 person you love❤🥰
🥰😩
Song is 🐐🐐
Honey, when I was younger...I would always seem to attract this type of man. It took me up too, until one day they both was singing the same song and went to shooting!!!!
Tory Lanez Tried To Steal N remix it
They nigga at the alter look like lebron James and shannon sharpe... smh
I love this song 🔥
COVIDNINETEEN VACINATIONS, THE 1ST STEP TOWARDS THE MARK OF THE BEAST IS HERE SOON. A great and formidable enemy seeks to enter into the very blood of My children through the altering of your DNA. Because of the curse that came about after the fall of the first man Adam, I came to make a way for you. You are renewed and made clean again by your belief and salvation in Me, your King and Messiah, sent by My Father to redeem you by My blood sacrifice on the Cross of Calvary. Only through Me, the Door, corruptible is made incorruptible, unredeemable made redeemable. I have ransomed you in order to bring creation back to its Creator. Creator YHWH was made flesh to overcome death, hell, and the grave, and to take what was tainted and impure and make it whole again. The spiritual battle that is raging now is ultimately to strip you of the Divine image of Myself that has been placed within the DNA of My creation. Ask Me for more wisdom and revelation about this and it will be given to you. The veil was torn, access granted when I shed My blood, died and rose again. We have created you in Our image, and when you walk in holiness, righteousness and purity, obeying My commandments, I am enthroned on your heart. You are then transformed in body, soul and spirit. When this transformation occurs, the very frequency of your cells then resonates with Me and raises you closer to your Creator and further away from the lower realm and lower frequencies which keep you bound. This is by design, and when indwelled, My Holy Spirit will be the gatekeeper of your heart, and your entire being, My sanctuary, and the place where I reside in you. When this occurs, My Kingdom is on earth, as it is in Heaven. It is then that I am able to provide victory over the curse for you, preserving the Divine design I have placed within your DNA. There are many layers of revelation to know what is coded there and hidden, secrets to be revealed to only those who overcome. However, if the gates are breached by sin, lack of obedience, compromise, or lukewarmness, the enemy sets up thrones (strongholds) instead of Me, because my laws, My Word have not been written on your hearts. You have a sworn enemy whose utter mission is to destroy you. He will stop at nothing, and as My Word has foretold, the time is here when the greatest of all violence and evil against My people, those made in My image, is taking place. The battle is for the soul, and the battle is about the blood. Satan’s ultimate goal from the beginning was to corrupt the seed, corrupt the blood that carries My blueprint in you, My design for those made in Our image, your DNA. There is only one way to ensure that My Throne is upon your heart and your eternal destination is sealed, or your soul will be lost forever. Your must be born again. Your heart must be sealed with My blood. You must be quick to repent often and seek holiness above all else. Love what is true and just. Be extremely careful what your eyes see and your ears hear. This is guarding your heart, guarding its gate. It is in sealing these portals to the soul, in commanding the spirit to govern or have mastery over the soul, that you overcome. You will then be prepared for My return, and be protected from the evil one. If you have not already done so, seal the portals to the enemy now! Confess your sins and repent for the midnight hour is here! Bind the access points that have given satan legal rights within your temples, within your body, mind, soul and spirit. Give satan and all his dark kingdom a certificate of divorce and be free from the bondage, and from all the oppression and possession in your bloodline immediately! Break the curse from your ancestors back to Adam. Cover it all with My blood and command the enemy out of your bloodline, sealing it as well, the gates to your heart, using the authority you have been given through Me. Exercise dominion as a gatekeeper and a son or daughter of the Most High God, taking your positions as heirs to My Kingdom. My Holy Spirit will then have permission to use you for My glory and manifest through you in this crucial hour. *(Please see the prayers on the right hand side bar and the one titled Increased Demonic Warfare Prayer covers everything He is instructing here)* This must be done this moment!! This is crucial! Precious moments remain before the implementation of the enemy’s plan to destroy the DNA of My creation, making you forever unredeemable. The Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence and it must be taken by force! Take My Holy Word and dispossess what has had control of your gateways and that of your family line through covenants, oaths, soul trades and agreements made by your ancestors. Do it this moment! In Me you will be made FREE! The implementation of the plans to alter your DNA and make it programmable by something other than Me, your Creator, are here. I control and govern the DNA I have placed within you, but if you allow man to administer anything within your bodies, that will recode your DNA, I will no longer be the controller. I will no longer recognize you as My creation. You will have become a mixture of something else, an altered form of man and technology, and therefore, not in My image any longer. Do you understand what I am saying? Truly the hour is here when you must prepare to make the choice to remain fully human, infused with My Spirit. The enemy wants nothing more than to deceive you through propaganda, fear and manipulation and cause you to allow either a mark or an implant (vaccine or digital tattoo) into your bodies that will forever separate you from Me. This is your reality right now! You must know what you will choose to do. When you open doors to the enemy through sin and through your choices in life outside of My ways, the demonic spirits appoint gatekeepers over your heart, your mind, and your soul. Then those spirits invite more, and when no repentance occurs, strongholds occur. The heart of an unregenerate man is wicked and deceitful above all things. But My Word is quick, powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing apart of your soul and spirit, your joints and marrow, as I discern the thoughts and intentions of your heart. Allow Me to write My laws on your heart and you will know truth at last. You will know what is now directly in front of you and the choices that are here for you and your loved ones. My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge, but it does NOT have to be this way. Allow My glory to penetrate your spirit so that your soul will come under submission. To not allow this, means you will remain in bondage and you will be easily deceived. If I do not dwell in you fully, and your gates have been breached, another will easily influence you and take governance. My people, I have given you the keys to the Kingdom. Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in Heaven and whatever is loosed on earth will be loosed in Heaven. Bind the strongman, bind the strongholds on your life and be delivered! The technology for the mark of the beast is here. It is upon you. It will be presented at first to be taken voluntarily, then very soon after, you will not be able to buy, sell or work. Do not wait another moment. Come out of Babylon and make Me King of your heart, the Divine Gatekeeper of your soul. The evil ones have set in motion their wicked schemes, as it must be so according to My Word. Many, many judgments will occur as I allow them. This is to wake up My church. You must know where you stand in your walk with Me, because in an instant, everything will change, and there will not be another opportunity to choose, because the choice will be made for you. You are either all in, or I am turning you over to your carnal mind and nature. You have the choice My loves, choose life and eternity in Me over eternal death in darkness.The time is now.  YAHUSHUA, JESUS THE CHRIST.  289

https://youtu.be/pIzN7CjgGCU
Should we marry for love 💘 or for happiness.  But what happens when the person you love 💘 doesn't keep you happy and the person who keeps you happy you don't fully love.
Tory lanes version is better
Ain’t that the same strings from Craig David and Sting - Rise and fall song???
Pretty teach me ugly lesson no joke.
Remember people this is music. N yes we all can relate to these emotions but don't live your life by lyrics. I like this song n he did a great job capturing what some are afraid to feel n say.
She’ll regret that shit lol
Note to self: Don’t be lacking on your wedding day.
My son remind of him😭🤟🏼
Plot twist : she get pregnant and becomes a single mom and he is ON TO THE NEXT 😂😂😂😂
Who is the girl in the video
Who’s shorty in the wedding dress
Why have I heard this before(like he remixed this from someone else)
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥!
Aint they supposed to stand when the bride walks in? lol
In 😍 so feeling  this.
First song of yours i've heard expected a rapper but discovered a singer. Hank may not have done it that way but Percy Sledge sure did!! That is what came to mind while listening you should cover the song (when a man love a women) just think is a good idea with your talent and as a tribute to a legend.
Ashamed to tell my friends how much I do for you cause , They know you'll never do the same for me😞💕💕💕
Yung Bleu your my music husband🥶
This is a hit 🔥🔥
Sorry Drake I want Durk on this instead. Said what I said 🤷🏾‍♂️
Where the xxxtentacion song snatcher at?!?!
Y’all talking about drake being invisible and dude just got dumped at his wedding 🤣

Love this song. This video not it for me tho
The song good, but Tory’s version is fire 🔥
Pretty face, pretty tempted But pretty taught me ugly lessons Pretty had me givin' more than I was gettin' So if pretty don't come with somethin', well, then I dead it Ashamed to tell my friends how much I'd do for you 'Cause they know that you would never do the same for me I wasn't lookin' for your secrets, they just came to me And they contradicted everything you claimed to be I took you to the club and you hugged on somebody that I know And I know them type of hugs Same shit I do to women when I know I used to fuck And I know they with they nigga, but they never brought it up I'm down these days Down to do better 'cause you know I done enough You should lay it down, we'll talk about it when you up

This concept in a video never gets old. I use to say if a guy was ever brave enough to do this I would definitely run off with him thinking it was romantic but now I'ma make sure the doors locked because some of my ex's are so crazy that they would actually pull up and do this shit. Anyways this guy looks like chicken run and it's kinda cute. I like how the church is filled with dark skinned people too even though the bride 👰 is fair my daughter is just like her and it makes me think about how her wedding day will be when she gets older.
AYOOO HER DRESS TOO BIG
Do a remixxxxxxxxx
Why he look like a dollar tree version of lebron
The groom 🤵🏾‍♂️ That nigga look like the animated character iceman in the movie the incredibles 🤷🏾‍♂️😂
The spiritual north america inspiringly sigh because car conclusively embarrass over a coordinated fridge. fortunate, plastic toothpaste
I’m tryna spoil sum body on feb14 😞
crime was comitted during the production.... that autotune vst choked himself to death while recking this track...
:(
God bless u brothers 💯🥇🎁
King drake🔥
2021 Drake reall should of made more of a effort to pop out fo this video this smokeeeeee 🔥 💨  My favorite parts of the song is all bleu he was cutting up
Song is such a vibe shits on repeat
Crazy how people finally recognize him. He came a long way 🙏
I know the  neighbors will not get tired of hearing this I play it everyday 📀🎤🔥.
I don't like it so who ever this being sent to who from what when and where
Funny this wouldn't happen with me not until I really know and only one way to find out so don't bring this to me bs
This song got a nice a lil vide too it
😍
I've never stop listening to this song
Just believe in yourself dude 😆👯‍♀️🖖🏾
The woozy footnote yearly level because sheet complementarily try outside a aboard scale. synonymous, peaceful seat
Grass seems greener on other side scared ready to run. So remember  y'all gotta be ready to full fill can't have side gotta be over that ex fer real. Happiness  is not that hard so if you have second thoughts
this is song of the year for shure!!!!! https://youtu.be/JH1_h1xZRnQ
That other guy looks like lebron james😂😂
what’s the brides name?💀
Nice song💯❤
Drakes Verse Is so powerful
Drakes the biggest Artist in the world
Aubrey will let you get that feature but he ain't showing up for the video shoot🤣🤣
vibe
💕🩺
They say time heals that gets me every time
Drake can never make time to get in someone else’s music video. He couldn’t even do it for DJ Khaled and he was basically harassing him for months about it. 😂
I feel like I heard that guitar at the beginning before.
Drake: where's the wedding at Director: yes  how to convert likes into subscribers......sorry thought this was google
Temazo, muy bueno, que mamapichas todo aquel que no haya encontrado esta canción
U Oop
This me and my baby song 😌
This how I'm feeling right now (cuz u mines still)
Am I the only 1 who looks up “ they say time heals” to find the song 😂😂😢🥲
if you’re listening to this in 2021 with all the bad stuff and terrible things happening, you’re an actual legend <3
India looks so beautiful 😍😩

This song can be about your ex getting married or your side piece getting married. 😭😭
Its Crazy how im listening to this after getting cheated on by my Fiance and losing everything, especially the quality time with my son & family I built & really thought I had....  Hopefully she still Sees me like this bride or at least remembers the times .... 😞.   -B
Smh that s song 🔥 because I can relate just from a women's point of view vice versa feel me 🤷🏾‍♀️😚

Now just imagine if KHALED was on the remix
When u stole the girl completely Savage😂
I love the indian version one
Don't go building a new life cause your mine still. I felt that
It's MINE not "mines" - pet peeve.
Imagine he just walked in to the wedding without auto tune or anything man would just be talking shit 😂
This song starts...”I still see your shadows in my room”
He’s still locked up in Canada 🇨🇦 that’s why he’s not in the video
Hey yung bleu
I really love this song❤! But the part "lemme beat that 🐱 one more time" that aint it...and how u gone marry another man while u not over ur ex💀
If ever!!!
This the song fr .
Why leave your future husband for someone who isn't trying to marry you
Devlin
*Mine
Drake talking that shit on here 😭🔥🔥🔥
Where's Drake's verse?
This shit hit different
🔥🔥🔥🔥
That man heartbroken 😔
This song is the most relateble thing ever.
From tik tok anyone?
Waouh j'aime 😘
I love this 💕💫🤟🤞🖤💪
this dude is an amazing artist, very talented
After dripreport
DripReport sent me here
Thought this guy was foreigner before I listened to interview
Some men are women need to understand that you can't show real love through SEX. It takes more than that.
Music...!
This song sounds like LUCID DREAMS by Juice World🤔
https://youtu.be/kGBgPEyjuYI
Big lump in my throat....
Can't stop listening
Bro got a mean set of teeth 😁
Did my ex help write this song??cuz I swear that boy don't want to see me happy unless it's with him💀fun fact: bro has a whole girl😂💀
All this song needed was the Hook and it would have been a hit
Too much auto tune
Being able to imagine, reminecse and daydream is great but that's all it is. Haha now click on the next song drunkass
Yesssssssss
that man nose big af he look like tobi from the sidemen
https://youtu.be/bcN2ZZ7URR4
This is my favorite track!!! Love this track. This is fire 🔥  👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿 The Next level Dj.m.smooth
Almost 2 years but ik you're mines still eb
🥰
"Ashamed to tell my friends how much I'd do for you 'Cause they know that you would never do the same for me"💔
Imagine being that dude at the alter 💀💀
Man me and my boa was cuttin up💔🙈🥺🥰🤧😣😪😍🥳🙁😿😭🥵🖕🏽🤦🏽
Yessir this bump
This song made me cry when I 1st heard it...When I acknowledged and accepted my wrongs in my last relationship unfortunately it was too late smh...You never know how much you truly love something until its gone
Reminds me Sting's melody ))
THIS ONE
🤩🤩🤩
Most toxic song ever🥴
I bet there's plenty women in here regretting that they left that dude they're  still in love with just to be with someone they're forcing themselves to love. We know many won't admit they want the ex back rather than the current
Pure fire right here 🔥🔥
Mine's is not a word
Sum my dumb ass would do on my wedding day 😭😂
Imagine having your girlfriend takin away on your wedding
Your mines still: favorite singer♥️
🔥
moral of the story: its cheaper to keep her
The beat to this song sounds like lucid dreams
Bout time this man fully made it
Hope they gave Sting credit for the music.
🔥 🔥 🔥    i. Love. This. Song. One. Daughter. Play it. Everyday
This is some stalkerish shit but 🔥🔥🔥
@dripreport indians version bettah
When you look at the instgram photo.
This video reminds me of Bambi by jidenna. Except he didn't get the girl in the end.
Move forward, going backwards will cause you more pain than before.  Your happiness shouldn't be the reason for him to change.  If he didn't change to make you happy, don't set aside your happiness for him to hurt you all over again and be in regrets
The power of the drake feature lmfao
What’s up bro can I get some cash
I'm just here for the bride. 😍
💔
When you busting N
Before you ignore this, remember that everyone started from somewhere! Im Khari, just a dude from Detroit (A real persona that eats cocoa pebbles cereal, not a bot haha) who almost gave up his dreams before even starting them, but said FUCK THAT. This is a track "Schroeder & Lucy" from my first EP Called 🌸"Scenery"🌸. I released it on September 3rd, my birthday, in 🇯🇵Japan 🎎, during a Typhoon. Actually, just like a typhoon, it blends many things together: Jazz, hiphop, boombap, cartoons. The entire EP is alot more of that. However, that is up to you if you would like to hear it! Schroeder and Lucy - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrKu99BK4Y4
*Drake bodied the verse like its 2011!!!*
Ayo...thasa good song
My favorite part was when India was running 👀
Moral of the story: Grammar is important kids.
A- Sting Rip Off
#flame .com
1:39 wow, they invited a jujutsu sorcerer to exorcise the cursed spirits. DAMN!!
Who is the woman

Damn .  You remind of our late legend JUICE WRLD 😥 9💔9💔9
The Guy who was left in the wedding : "Nice guys always finish last should've have known that"
30 mins later: OPssssss I just made the greatest mistake of my life ...
Super wack video

Riding off into the sunset
This song is toxic.

Juice wrld sample orrrr nah ?
My son said what u no bout this ...I said that's my nigga...music 🎶 is not for a age group  its universal  last I checked.. He 24... He replied  you right ma you right💜💯
Don’t take him back sis. It’s a trap!
So who's out here tryna talk about how this man bit off a dead guy's beat? Anybody else hear that, "Lucid Dreams," opening chord and descending chord arpegiation, because I fucking do.
Drip report😂❤️🔥🔥
This song is mad lit
Indian Version Is Better
🖤💨👈🏼
This song makes me wanna cry 😢
Why is the guy who won black chinas mommas show on Zeus on here? Lol
This is my favorite song lyrics melody and sound
Lately she been noticing he ain't me
This is my fav song
DAMNNNN I played this on replay so many timessss! Its so relatable.... but he literally ruins a wedding just to say “lemme beat the 🐱 one more time” IM DEADDDDD 😂😂😂😂
This song is garbage
😭💔
This song rel hard g i rel like this song he know we he saying i experiencing this right now.. She is mines still
Another song sampling Sting.🤷🏿‍♂️
Everybody deserves a second chance.....
His voice is so unique
He can say nigga but I can't. Also. Too much autosync. no talent.
top
this got me thinking of my big mom lol
Maybe this why my ex keeps hitting me up
This song makes me think of my ex, Rest In Peace love 💜
Lady
this is my shit when im in my feelings
Reminds me of my ex..
The skillful comb mechanically copy because ping phongsaly wonder despite a receptive pumpkin. envious, spurious dog
The most toxic/best song ever 😩😩🥰🥰
Drake is fire.
Don’t go build a life without me❤️
The brave capital preoperatively surprise because branch genomically intend with a prickly advantage. chief, windy plantation
Who came here after dripe report's Indian  version of this song😀😂
🌪🔥❄️
Love the whole damn song
I'm here because of dripreport idc what yall say
Here after DripReport 😂🙏
🥶💔
1:34 lebron james
1:30 paul george😂
Don’t ever let a bitch do what she want from you and let you down even know that you’s may break up !
Well thats 4 minutes 17 seconds of my life i wont get back. Lame ass song lol
Sad culture
"I've always overstood more than me"
😍♥️♥️♥️
Hope my ex don't pop up at my wedding 🤦‍♀️
When you show so much emotion when you can’t sing...
Seeing my wife India love
The lady in the video is beautiful and that dress 😍.   The way he came and rescued her I was like yes go get your lady😍
I recognize the same musical motif found in Lucid Dreams
She belongs to the streets
F@#$ that nigga you can tell him that you're mine still!!!!
😍,I’m still yours! I’m running back no matter wat is that giving your power!
Why does he sound like that
This song cuts me like a razor
Yeah both got what I want and I want to see each other you're so happy don't make no sense
How do you happy to see Youngblood but not the other person I can't believe you have a c c young blue yeah but not him you like you don't want him you like the other person said for him why you like the other person I don't like this video but why you like young blue studded him he's happy to see you you huffing and puffing you don't want to see him but you want to see the other person that don't make no sense at all like for real for real
Drake part sucks
Oh nah baby.
This song have deep feelings loving it
Don’t go build no life with out me Cuh you mines still🥴💯💯
Yea
Drake: Pretty face/pretty tempted/ but pretty taught me ugly lessons.// Pretty had me giving more than I was getting......  realist bar
here from dripreport
India Love =HOLY GRAIL😍👑
💯💯💯💯💯❄️
...MINES?!🤨🤨🤨
IM ONLY THIS TOXIC AND CRAZY OVER ONE FEMALE ILL MOST DEF POP UP AT THE WEDDING LIKE THIS HEA
Drake must cost way too much to be able to afford a verse and for him to do a video too.  Drake: $500,000 to do a verse and $500,000 to do video for the song Yung blue: damn, just the verse is cool
Right why Drake not on here that's crazyyy yo. It would of been way better if he was and church or the ref
its funny that they put the name of the song "mines" still lol completely wrong way to say that lol but song is fire
ok but she is actually pretty
India love bad af
If your reading this you have great taste of music
i want Beyoncé to hop on this track i can just hear her voice on this beat 🎶😌🎵
Love you
The  when you took her
I swear I'm addicted to bleu cheese
The toxicness✨✨imma still listen tho
I love this song
getting lucid dreams vibes! hope sting doesn't sue you for this one lol.
Just found out boosie sign him ....wow good pick finally
Drake killed this..
Autotune a life saver huh
Uk viewer, Never heard of you but after listening, I instantly subscribed to your channel. Keep up the great work.
I love when the song and video match🥰
Real shit 💯💃🏽
This scenes from a urban noval
I like your song
y’all know who the girl is
A prime example of nicki and the professor as soon as nicki moved on that’s when realize that he loved her when she finally find a man that appreciate her values  PSA: ladies don’t be a nicki and men don’t be the professor 🤩
why everyone is hating on this? it's a vibe
Waited for champagnepapi for over 4min
Where drake at ??????
3:46, FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES
Am here after dripreport
Anyone because of drip report🔥🔥🔥
Here after dripreport's  remix ✋🏼
pov: ur here from dripreport
Oke drake where u at my nigga
I have a love hate relationship with this song.
If it was a mutual break up you can get back together but if she cheated keep it moving king.
Damn........
Shape of my ❤. Sting vibes
The one time where drake ain’t the main event. Song heels
Toxic
Pretty face, pretty tempted But pretty taught me ugly lessons Pretty had me givin' more than I was gettin' So if pretty don't come with somethin', well, then I dead it.....
That bride fireeee tho l
4:30
My fuckinng anthem
Bruuuuh my life currently
Always love the songs Drake features in
This is so underrated who else agree
Plot twist: he trynna save the guy
The main verse seems like they ripped off *Sting - Shape Of My Heart!*   *ANYONE?*
Hoodville for president, future for vice 🙌
To that special person that you can't live without #your#mine#still
I just can’t with the grammar, and the verses sound like something soft I’d post on Facebook back in middle school. Drake makes this song, nothing more to it.
https://youtu.be/QgY7P_ML54A
https://youtu.be/5w1l-hKY5YU
https://youtu.be/RPxZmYuiniM
bat ganun? ako lang ba may narinig na "medyo angry" hahhaha
My Ex wife, left me for her Ex Boyfriend from high school all because he said “let me hit it one time, I guarantee you will leave him” ten years of marriage down the drain. . . . . He dumped her 8 months later and started seeing someone else, then she came crawling back to me. I not gonna lie to y’all, I almost took her back, cause I Loved her soo much. FUCK This song, it just reminds me that some people can come in and steal your whole world in a blink of an eye.
this song is sooo adictiing
Ay dellan if u seeing this love u bro
🔥🔥🔥
This shits fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I FUCKING LOVEEEE THIS SONGGG🥰🥰🥰🥰😫
Why 1 of bro ear bigger then the other tho
Moral of the story: If she’s about to get married and she leaves with you..She would also leave YOU standing there..And leave with another guy...It’s in her to leave...🎯
Why isn’t drake in this video

Drake fucked up the song!!! 😩😩😩
He would of got merked running in my brothers wedding like that 🙄
if you’re listening to this in 2021 with all the terrible things and bad stuff happening, you’re an actual legend <3 🙏🏽
Drake has finally reached his ultimate level of invisibility 😳🥴.
Hey 😀
Song is on repeat about 100 times a day. Whole vibe.
I play this song daily! It's so Good😩👌🏾
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Anyone else get toxic vibes From this song but it’s catchy  and gets stuck in your head but really though u wait till she about say I do to finally show up and show her u can’t live without her 🥴🥴🥴 cmon now
Doesn't it sound like Sting's Shape of my heart
Drake is saying what’s on every guys mind whenever they break up with that really conceited girl they thought they could wife... but it’s cool though 😒
Ah yes, the auto tune is strong with this one.
Love it man keep them coming
I think drake did his thing but i really feel ty dolla wouldve been a better fit  on this song
LlllllllAaaaaLaaaaaaaa LOOOOOOVVVEEEEE THIS SONG. Beautifully created❤❤❤❤❤❤
0:51 is he holding the camera himself?
That's a nice car
This song is 🔥🔥. This reality for a lot of people tho. They married and still messing with ex’s.
Such a pretty song though ❤️
Queen & slim vibes yu get better & better bleu
This a masterpiece
Sh¡t I'm obsessed with this song😣😣
Love this ❤️
So, I’ve heard this song before but my ex just played it to me saying this is how he feels 🤦🏾‍♀️ I don’t have a new boo yet but I am talking to other men at this point. I don’t have time for these shenanigans frfr because he does still have my heart! 😩😩😩
No
Imagine a mf walking in y’all wedding saying lemmie beat it up one more time and then leaves wit ya girl 🤣🤣🤣
I know them type of hugs 💯
The audacity he has to walk into a *church* of all play as and had such language 😂😂😂
Which car is that?😂
not feeling the fact drake wasn't in the video. So many creative ways he could have been in this video. Song is dope but slightly repetitive.
Bro this song is fire ong
Another banger 💯
1:39 Who’s cool ass uncle is that ? 😂😂
🥰
Isn't this a Shape of my heart/Lucid Dreams sample or am I tripping
This a supervillain back story
Felt drakes verse... like it was mines
Drake not being in this video is______________!!
"They say time heals but don't go build a life without me"❤️❤️❤️❤️
Your voice is a medication to my deeper wouds ..
Congratulations on your 60K residual income  Growth in #Youtube  #Investments
I was getting  married that day, either to  my fiance or you... wasn't leaving that alter with my father's name.
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰😍😍😍😍😍
India so damn fine it dont make no sense
Damm the way she turned her head so quickly makes u think... she always on the look out to see if she recognized any of the people she’s slept wit 2:46 😂
R.I.P. King Von 🖤🕊
Honey, I m witch, drake is passt AGAIN liquid dreams???? Get fucked out Im peruvian South América I know more than u
Whats the name of the actress in the wedding? or insta
NO! Homie got the game backwards. She made her choice hence the reason she's at the alter with another bug-eyed dude. I wouldn't dare be at a church breaking down doors, simping.
Who else heard this song and thought of a old hight school ex crush that moved on 😍🥰❤️💯
hey i love yeer song
What’s the girl name tho?
I'm down these days, down to do better, 'cause you know I done enough You should lay it down, we'll talk about it when you're up....😔
😔🤦‍♂️ everytime I think I'm good my ass keep finding songs like this I hope time heals my mistakes
Music vid mad it 10 times better
Beat one more time 2:49 best part

Je voulais voir Drake ds le clip🥰
I’m turning that wedding into a funeral if this ever happened to me.
A dope ode to the graduate
domestic abuse?  yeee f**k it why not
When you ran off with the girl
Everything
hi
she really left a man she loves and was gonna marry for a man that showed up LATE to the wedding to get her back SAD
This is so toxic lol
Y’all need to stfu it’s a song eat a beef🥱😂
High
Drake really normalizing not appearing in music videos.
Anybody gonna comment on the beat!
2 kids , 13 years,  Mrs.Trice 4 life 🗣Gunna Dine Your still Mines ❤💚💜💙💛
DiS Bih hard and ion even fw dis typa muSic🐍🌋
But the towards the end when she and other dude walk off stage as she takes your hand
The whole video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ght31Zd-2hg
https://youtu.be/_dK_vqjxc7A
Am I the only one Tht hears “lucid dreams” by juice world
You can't help what the heart wants 💔  always stay 100... no lies
The expression on the grooms face with that look has me dying 😂😂😂
Only very few make you feel true happiness and love ❤️
DRAKE 2010-2021 G.O.A.T
Toxiccccc, but 🔥
This was a good song however it's was at that moment I realized most women are for entertainment purposes only
You better off.
All his songs hit fr
He won’t change
would have been better if he woke up from a dream then seeing her ig photos of her wedding in the end...

This dude looks like a mini 50 cent
The only thing that I related too  in this song is when she is  running and holding her chest up, that shit hurts 😌😌
was up
Drake's verse is just soo special 🙌🏽
When I seen India I was shook she is sooo 🔥
This hit different. 🔥🔥🔥
Pretty taught me ugly lessons:(
Someone please help me find the original to this beat...can’t think of it and have asked everyone I know.
I hope this on official lover boy
Love the song, but sound a little possessive
1:21
what's the females name that be in this video? She is Beauitful.100%
Those hugs that Drake was talking about are real
This song reminds me of Corina
The last part when you took her
This a toxic ass song😂 I love it doe
I just realized that's the same girl from the song Chippi Chippi by Sheck Wes
🤟🏾🤟🏾🤟🏾🤟🏾👀👀
This is my new favorite song
Got me in ma feelings🤨💯💥😂🤣
batman 😜 burg hood p.c
India is bad she’s a natural beauty
I love the song but I fell in love w the video more
If ur listening ily troy 🌻
This song hits different when your going through it fr fr! 😔 😤
This song is trash.
Why is no one talking bout the camera work on this...my goodness
I have these lucid dreams
Drake really took j.I flow😂
What’s the name of the girl ??
*Hits harder then my bipolar mother.*
This is exactly why I say women aint shit. She already knew that she did not want to marry him, so why would she lead him on all the way into getting married. Listen women, if you love a man that do wrong things than its ok because that's what you love follow your heart. But don't lead a good man on.
Remix with tory lanez would be fire
My favourite moment in this video is the whole time I watch it
bruh them shits were boutta fall out 💀
My sis India!!!!
Does it in the same page and I will be there at the same time I don't have a picture of the same page and I will be there at the
That melody sound like lucid dreams
This is my favorite song I  love H
Ngiyawayindeka Mfwethu!
whats the girls @ ???????????????????????????????
Shawty bad. shawty thic .like my mind I’m in this bishhhhh
Peep how at the very end, his facial expression changed like he just realized he made a huge mistake...and peep the "trembling" of the bass sound that happens right @ that moment, then peep how the song ends abruptly. What you just witnessed was the side effects of selfishness & LUST.    EXES ARE EXES FOR A REASON!!!! IF 2 PPL ARE HAPPY, YOU DO NOT DISTURB THEM WITH YOUR BULLCRAP AND MIND MANIPULATION JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE STILL SINGLE!!!!  Follow me on IG @teeredondatrack
Nope! You gotta be crazy to leave someone standing at the altar to run back to an EX!!!!! DUMB AS HELL, MOE!!!!! YOU BOUT TO BE MISERABLE AND LIVING A LIFE OF DAILY REGRET!!!!! ILL PASS, SWEETS!!!!!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Os2KM60X-Oo
Finally a video that makes sense with the song!💜
Drakes verse contradicts the song. He should have stayed off this track
Who read the commentaire and same time listing the musicale
her eyebrows is the size of a  of my pinkie toe XD
The groom gave Yung Bleu that eye my momma give me when I ask too go to the Mall
This is okay but Drake the reason this got views like that
Thts f**ked up...total disrespect, from her and him...
Why at the end they look like they both immediately regretted that shit 😂
My favorite part is when they run out the church holding hands happy asf bout to start they life together again and they ride out at the end
So fire
All I know is...if I was the groom that sanctuary would’ve been aired out...
She belongs to the streets.
Play this every morning on my ride to work or when I’m just walking 🚶‍♂️ this is a joint here 🔥
Why Black men pick non Black women as there main women in videos SMH
Idk y but I thought dawg had a Jamaican accent lol
Okay okay 👌🏿💃🏾
drake ass be giving me chills on the verses
Bobby shmurda got out on his r&b bag feat drake
love for marsia✨
Why isn’t Drake in the video? that’s dumb
Maria Carey did this video with "We Belong together". Y'all running outta content now huh.
Giving me juice wrld lucid dream vibes
Leave ya husband for a fuck boy? Lol ight
Big fucking song yute. True words....Drake words as well I can see happening to many.
Song fire real talk
❤️ ☮️ 🙌🏼
RIP SDS 😘😘😘
Drake is having fun and bringing up new talents to the world
When the tiktok reenactment is better, I’m disappointed
if it wasn't for drake i don't think i would notice this song
Sting is making so much money off these dumbass young producers man. Stop giving away your dollars make a new beat!!
✨🌹✨
Drake must charge too much to be in videos...
Song was lit without him👅👅👅💯
This is the best song ever I have it on repeat
Drake shouldve been right next to young bleu in that car singing
This sh!t business
where drake... he never be coming to music videos
This is my song I love this and it different 🤍
Not sure what reality we in because in mine he get his ass beat by all the groomsmen.  Ain't no running away smiling fam.  😒😒
Lmaooo here im awe like 😍😍😍 wat is he gonna tell her while he walks down the aisle and he says let Me beat that 🐱 ! I was like 💀😵😵🤦🤦🤦🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂¿ ftw?
I wish Drake would’ve been in the video but Bleu killed it💯
Who can relate to this song🙋🏽‍♂️
Reality for our generation....Don’t lose her.
The beat sound like lucid dreams a lil bit but slowed down
Sign Treeana millions on the table
Love this song I love all music it’s his voice for me
My Fave song!!!🥰🥰🥰🥵😩
This is the one song Drake didn't need to be on
This song hits different when you find yourself in this situation. #TrueStory..”Love is blind but Love is Real”💕💎💙💕💎💙💕
I wanna hear future on this
Girl he aint never gon marry you 💀
When she leaves to go to her real man ❤️
stolen by sting
This & Bryson Tillers Let Em Know ....
Everyone’s like “shit drake snapped “ drake was shut n had a short ass verse the mane dude was better .
I’m glad this song wasn’t out 5yr ago. 😩 I’m mature enough to listen but not apply to my life 🙃 lol
This song makes me think about building a time machine and making it myself way to gassss
Walked away from a man who stepped up and wanted to marry her, for nothing....
🖤
Happiness should rely on both partners. A man will sleep with his wife not her family. Don’t get married if you aren’t HAPPY!
this man said let me beat it one more time and the man u was going to marry wanted a lifetime stay woke ladies
The MOST EMPTY wedding ever..
When a song hits home 🥰🥰🥰😋😋
Here before 100mil
💣💋💋
I felt this shit straight from my heart you did this Bleu
What’s da girl ig
Video and Song go's perfect together, female move on with her life and still thinks about him he often reminds her of them 😭

Umpteenth years later, she's still tryna change the man and ask him why he aint marrying her lol. She gon' regret why she left that altar with a man tellin her, "lemme beat that p* up 1 mo' time lmaoooo" I can't deal with this ahahahaaa!!!

What really sucks is that, if it wasn't for drake being on this song he wouldn't have gotten that many views, in such a short amount of time.
this song's for toxic people lol
That car is so dope, I want it in pink❤
Dope song. I'm not going back to get no x tho.
Fuck the drama 🎭  Go get you women  Make things right  We only got one life One body One shot  To find happiness with one ☝️  So fix what needs fixing  If you know you only want her to smile for you and no one else.   Get you women back if you hurt her. Make it right  Don't waste no more time! We only one ☝️ time here 🥺
Time heals

This make me miss my husband so much, March 2021 mark 1 year of his passing. I wish I can change time. I love 💕 you best friend forever, can't wait to see you again.
Drake proved that he's here to stay...they can come with any sound he'll jump in!!!!
I Pray anyone That sees This is Successful in Life..
Prolly one of the prettiest girls I’ve seen in tv ‘
This song F a hater
My favorite song😍😍😘😘
Loving the concept of this video😍 why is drake not in it if he has a verse... he should of been one of the groomsmen or something🤦🏽‍♀️
U a fuckin genius
Drake really a goat man he ATE this fr
Hate people saying this is underrated...you really don't hear it?? He took the first half of the main beat and melody from Lucid Dreams and used it throughout THE WHOLE SONG, with slightly different backbeats, 808's and bass to it each time, after the first 30 seconds of it literally being the first half of the lucid dreams beat stopped short...of course it s gonna be catchy, and a band accused Juice Wrld of doing that with THEIR SONG for lucid dreams...so this man just used it for a THIRD TIME, like it was original 😂 at least Juice didn't bring in multi-platinum artist to boosts numbers, and made a new sound when he came on with the song. Wasn't generic sounding...i mean don't get me wrong..obviously enough to make money this day, artists who used the melody and beat before proved that 😂🤐🤷‍♂️. don't get me wrong..I'm not saying it's a bad song..i'm just saying, it's not underrated (VERY popular), and there were alot of thing that made that easier to achieve, such as VERY VERY familiar beat to an already MASSIVELY popular song, and A-list celebrities in your song haha.
1:00 - 1:35  felt it when he looked back and made contact with shawty 🤦🏽‍♂️
best song everrrrrrrr
Kinda sound like Juice Wrld “ Lucid Dreams “
I fucken love BLEU BRUH HES FIRE, THERES NO ONE LIKE HIM

Great lyrics but way too much autotune man.
I wouldn’t have let drake jump on this I would have kept this solo
My new favorite song! Love it. ☺☺
💪🏾💪🏾
My favorite moment is when he start to sing 🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
Made it here after watching Boozie singing and dancing in his car while jamming to this song! 😍💖 Love it!!! 💖💖💖
Drake always gonna make you call your ex. Don't drink and Drake.
You need to put Boosie on the remix. The way he was singing this song at the top of his lungs made it hit different.  Glad I found u. Song on repeat. Who can't relate to this song.
He got in that car and closed that door gently even though he was upset😩
For you to do what she did, the love is deep. Love conquers all. 🥰😍
This gonna make him blow up
wish i could like this song 10000000 times absolute banger!!
Tbh...I feel for the groom, wtf. Bride is toxic af, so is bleu.

It's them XLs and lashes for me🥴🥰
The look the groom makes when hes rapping cracks me up everytime
Your went hard on the beat when u busted the door
A
The vid was kinda cute until he crashed the wedding and one of the first things he says, isn’t how much he loves her, but instead, “lemme beat the 🐱 one more time” I’m HOWLING
37k dislikes is all the men that didn’t get they girl back
It’s 1am and this song’s giving me bitter sweet memories
I wanna hear the underwater 🌊 version!
The gurl on this music video looks like my daughter 🥰
JESUS IS COMING BACK SOON REPENT AND ACCEPT HIM AS YOUR LORD AND SAVIOR
Drake was going hard
Just found out about this dude, I fw it.
THIS A VIBE 🔥🏌️
I hate this song cause it cause it takes me back,but I love it cause it’s real music.
Drake messed up the song
The ending
Where tf is drake in this? He just ain’t here
Does anyone know the girl or her instagram?
Times heals...don’t waste it!  #strongertogether💯
This song is so toxic. And I love it !  Lmao
Wait a got damn minute, so this my first time hearing nor seeing this song. So you mean to tell me. She moves on find someone that treats her right and doing everything she needs and he get to come back on the day of her wedding and ruin it to go back to somebody who wasn't giving you what you needed at the time when he had the chance....LADIES!!! IS THIS WHAT WE'RE GOING TO KEEP ALLOWING BECUZ HE JEALOUS ANOTHER MAN TOOK HIS SPOT WHEN HE WASN'T TRYING TO PERSERVE IT IN THE FIRST PLACE. NOOOOO NOT THE NARRATIVE ANYMORE...NO THIS B.S.
This is probably the only song that I don’t think drake needed to be in
This a banger🔥🔥🔥🔥
When you popped up and walked in the church that was gansta

I’m sorry but all I hear is boosie saying “ BITCH BLIND “ 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 any time I hear this song now 💀
Hella underrated. Man this song deserves more than a billion streams.

Shame to tel my friend how much I would do for you cause they knw u wouldn't do the same for me
He jus dont want her to move on h
Toxicity 101 gentlemen. Take notes
The Good Ones, go. The Good Ones go, if you wait too long. So you should go. You should go, if you wait too long. Don't you go getting married. Don't you go get engaged. I know you're getting older, you shouldn't have to wait. 🎶💕🦉
Wats her ig?
When she took off with him❤😩
This song make me want to cuff one🙌🏾
Fuck this is my story, except I still married him.
You've ruined the time we've spent together... So don't come to ruin my wedding and disrespect the one who has chosen to honor me and my family ...That day I'll be sleeping in jail and you six feet under
I feel like thats the worst feeling, loving a girl so much that it dont work out and later finds somebody else and starts a new life with them... </3
When niggas think this sounds like juice world lucid dreams but it’s really nas - the message
anyone knows the bridesmade instagram in this video
I don't think so but I'm at there School
When you realize Drake is singing from the POV of the groom it just makes it that much better
Who else thinks the girl kinda looks like india love?😍

I’m stuck in something I can’t seem to let go even tho I don’t feel the same and I really can’t stand being rid to them but I can’t leave either ........ he pops pills and everything when we separate and I can’t help but wanna make sure he doesn’t harm himself so I always come back but I truly don’t love him anymore I play this for him all the time and soul ties.... anyone got any suggestions???
frl
best part of this song is when its over! 🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑
India is 🔥
I can't decide if im going bust in my ex or my baby momma's wedding like this. Pulling a karaoke speaker singing this song....yep...I'm definitely doing this

Why is it that when you’re in love your whole world flips up side down
I was waiting to see drake 🙄
It hits me alot
damn why i keep listening to this
This song is so on point for my life rn 😭💔.
🔥💎🔥💎🔥💎🔥💎🔥
Who’s the girl in the music video
AYOO WHEN U STOL HIS WIFE THAT A TRUE MAN RIGHT THERE
Is it bad I play this literally everyday lol
AM I literally the only one that caught him mouthing ''boy'' once he walked in the church and said ''girl tell me you lying '' but he really mouthed BOY !!! OMG BLEU WHYYYYYYYYYYY !!
I’m in love tho 😑🧟‍♂️
Clicked this cause I saw India 💙
This shit is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The groom look like that black man from mr. Incredibles😂😂😂
Bunch of autotune dogshit
More garbage music
This song is on repeat until I fall asleep 😴 😪
this songs actually pretty good
Damn Bleu be having a bih daydreaming bout cheating and shit 🤣🤣🤣
The look on their faces after the excitement of being back together smh u should’ve just got married
Most TOXIC song of the year!!! Hands 🙌 down
Idk why i feep like this song came out years ago idk if I'm the only one who feels like this
All toxicity aside, the heart wants what the heart wants. You should never marry anyone as long as you have an attachment to someone else. With that being said, people do change...everyday. In this video, it did show a door closed, but it was opened figuratively and literally...
this is fire 🔥👑
Heard this in a post from Hoodville so I had to look this up🤣
I thought that was boosie for a second🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This sounds similar to the Lucid dreams beat
https://youtu.be/XE4W66lAvvw
india love 😍
He just stole homie wife, just like that 😫
This song so damn toxic, I love it
What da girl he wit Instagram @
https://youtu.be/JRdgGY1fgn8
Ayo why the dude in the Middle look like malcolm x
India could never act to save ha life
Boosie put me on to this 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
My life story
Boosie BadAzz sent me
her MINES still what though .......
Hey
The smile on his face when they rideing off says it all
Definitely when they driving away smiling happy asf❤️🥰
I hate how hurt I be from this song 😪 I can literally feel it in my heart 🥺 I gotta stop listening .....   I’ll be back tomorrow 😐
Toxic. She should have stay with her fiancé.
this man spent his life savings on this feature
I love this song🗣️
Haha I had to see the lyrics video because I swear I thought he was saying 🎵I don't want no boo boo faces!🎶  🤣🤣🤣 I swear I thought he was talking about ppl giving him stank faces for getting back together 🤷🏾‍♀️🤣🤣!
https://youtu.be/Nsei6-ACVqs
He said let me beat that😻😻 one more time 😂😂😂 thats what he walk up in a wedding saying lol thats a nigha response fr
7.8k bustas hatas
It's the everything about this video for me
Hi
Bobby shmurda brother
Bvv
she so pretty.
This song just told me to go back to my toxic exe and I couldn’t have received a better sign lord
Damn Drake kinda failed taking over this song?
Can we talk about how Beautiful she looked in this
https://youtu.be/-6bi302ip7k
he came out of benneys with that lowrider
on repeat babe. love it
this song hurts a lil too much bruh 😞
Top 10 Song of 2020 hands down!
I'm addicted to this cause I'm heartbroken 😔 I play this back each time it ends
Best song he got rite here🔥🔥
2:45 imagine this happening to you at your wedding 🤣
Beautiful words an song❤
Late night listening to R&B a VIBE!!!
Is the girl India Love?...thought so but wasn’t sure
The beginning sounds like a wizkid song i heard but i can't remember the song name
It doesn't hit any different than many of the Songs Niccas make like this, the Gag is, it's just a song, Niccas or Females ain't 10 Toes down about it, as we all c, they just put a Melody to it and let watever words come out of their mouth they make sure it sounds good... Wanting to have this is a Process, a Lesson, an Understandin, a Commitment, this is just a Song.... To all Men and Women, If We Want Better We Gotta Do Better, We Can Have It All 🙏🙏
The ending is a nod to The Graduate, so sad
Drake is so damn relatable to everyone. As much as I love listening to tunes about drug dealing and killing people lol, Drake talks about shit everyone can relate to.   Whole song is fire.
nice thanks 2 sting
She don’t look like the type you tie down, but song still fire🔥🔥🔥🔥
Please remove drake from this song cuz Bleu was killing it by himself. Drake part got nothing to do with what Bleu saying. FACTS
POV : 2 weeks later she walks in on him cheating on her
홍ㅎㅇㅊㅇ

Galatians 6:9❤️ God will bless you if you remain to do good! David trusted in God
I like the lyrics reminiscences
Matthew 5:44❤️ Love your enemies, do good to them that hate you!

This soulful asf,  *y isn't THIS 200mil yet*
Oh and India can do no wrong
Best part is that drake isn't in the video.

“Shame to tell my friends how much I’d do for you cuz they know that you would never do the same for me” that line just hits different if you could relate 😪

This song just gets me in my feelings every time i listen for real especially after going through shit.. deep song bleu you went to hard on em!!
the best✨
As young bleu should I stay listening to his music before this song😘
It's the riddim for me ..ddg would of kill dis if he was on it👀
Better stop using stings instrumentals he gonna sue yah lol
“Times flow”
Boo sir gave this a double boost
😫😫
This shit hit different 💯🔥🙏🏽😩
I sing this song to myself on rainy days..
The bride is definitely beautiful the video shows that she’s not really happy with dude just by her looking at him but when bleu walk in her whole face expression lit up I also think she don’t really know what she wants ,even though it took weeding for him to realized that he may be losing out on the best thing that could of ever happened to him sometimes it takes that  but situations happens like this all the time it’s all about making the right choice it also shows how all she can do is think about By showing images of him . The last part of the video shows  the whole mood change . The video is awesome it actually goes with the song and it displays what people are going through in real life
For a woman with a 💔 Gosh !😔
This song hit your soul when you play it at night time
I heard this on the radio this song is hot an a huge hit i loved the whole video amazing job stay blessed the whole thing is my favorite😊
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ever love someone so much you think about them with someone else in your mind and you be feeling like its reality and its only cuz that person is the one❤💏!.

I can really relate to this song with my toxic ass 💔💔
We all have someone that comes to mind when we hear this song.  Take Chances and Live! Go after the one you want not the one you settled for. Otherwise, you will spend the rest of your life thinking about them anyways. ❤️

No lie Drake flow on this sound like Lil Durk
Why would she leave someone who was going to marry her, for someone who didn't value her 🤔
Drake definitely didn’t outshine this time.. his verse was ight🤣😂
I love this song honestly! I just left my ladie it was really complicated I had to understand but wasn't receiving the same thing of understanding and yeah I miss her but we can't be putting eachother through that type of stuff it's unhealthy not good for one mental state I miss her but I can't go back because I feel if I do it'll just be the same or worse she writes me but I can't even answer the song make me feel good tho
I am a big fane
Boosie took you here don’t lie

Watch how their moods instantly change in the car, that's when you realize you only have sex in common, no other meaningful substance.
Love this song its so nice   ... love went into it ❣❣❣❣❤
“Don’t go build a life without me cause your mine still” 🥺🥺 the most relatable line
This song was fire before the Drake feature

Lowkey drake kinda ruined it
Where is drake ?🤷
🔥🔥🔥
If listen to this ur music taste is 10/10
I'm just still asking of all the places he could've put that verse in the song, why did he have to say that as soon as he busted into the church.😂🤦🏾‍♂️💯
1Million subscribed !! Shout out from Sea all d way from 1.5 Algiers New Orleans ya heard me!! Keep stepping shit!💯🔫😈⛽️🎰
🔥
*"I wasn't looking for your secrets they just came to me, and they contradicted everything that you claim to be."* DRAKE NEEDS TO STOP PLAYING WITH ME!! 😭💔
Drake's already finished the race, he's just running extra laps at this point.
You know ya boi bleu got them thots on the side too
ohhhhh sooooo nice the vibe tune an well love it Draæ& yung bleu
This video is so deep. Shout out to the director for telling a compelling story so beautifully. This song is a whole bop too.
What’s her name?
LOVE THIS TO DEATH‼️🥰
And whoever disliked this song a fucking goofy this shit nice ash
Too bad he gonna be owned by drake for having this feature and I’m positive no one found this song because of drake😐
poor bradon 💀
yung bleu really a goat do whatever he want in the game and make a hits
When he say "Pretty taught me ugly lessons " they really put a ugly dude there
so nobody's going to talk about that he's got 999 subscribers no matter how many times you subscribe to his channel it stays at 999!??
Love the end ♡
Ffs 💘
When she start running 🤣
Even though I like the song, we have got to stop going back into unhealthy relationships. In real life, u'll get jumped pulling some shit like that during a wedding ceremony.
MAKE SURE YALL THINK ABOUT WHAT I SAID  this guy sounds like future if he wasn't on autotune but then on autotune LET THAT MARINATE!

This is my shit
They say time heals that part 💪🏽
One of my new favs
Pretty taught us all ugly lessons.
What’s her name? 👀
Hahaha damn drake sound like JI
"את יודעת היינו ילדים כאלה"🎶
This that 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Congrats on going double platinum my homie
He was never hers to begin with. lol
Where drake at tho 😂
They say time is don’t go build a life with me yesss
Fucked up the video drake should of been here
Her face is so top tier to me 😩💖
When she sees you and smiles😍
Makes me think of my love coming rescuing me
So Drake didn’t make the video? He could have been the preacher or something
Song on repeat definitely !!
This was me and my now wife. She came back to the city engaged but I knew we belonged together. She wasn't herself with him, only with me. Been together 13 years now, married for 8.
lol He is that ex that won’t go away 😩🥴😂
this song speaks to my soul 👐🏾
y’all notice he look different a little ??
❤
U have the best girl in the world
They say time heals, don’t go build a life without me cuz you’re mine still 🔥
Me when my girl doesn't txt back
Sorry dude, you too late. You done hurt me enough. It’s over,. I’m moving on with my new bae. I suggest you move on as well. Wishing you happiness and much success. ✌🏾 ❤️
Nigga i smell juice wlrd beat en ryhm. Whhhhy nigga
This man is underrated
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Bumping this shit 💯💯 all day! I still feel bad for homeboy tho she did him dirty. 👀
India love is fire
Typical dumb heaux
3:55 Take a look at the moment when they laughing in car,and became sad in the shadow
And the question is:Where is Drake?!!!
Also this go hard i js came back August 11th 2025 and ts still hard
This dude should pay boosie for advertising.
Wait what? Am I slow or this instrumental almost identical to lucid dreams?
Who else is re-watching this? 👀
Lyrics and message? Whack. Beat? Whack. Amount of autotune? Whaaaaack.
What’s the girls name
My heart brought me here but can we talk talk about India thooo🙌🏽 stunning
shit i bought the same beat haha so to nate rhoads !
Drake and Jcole got the highest rated feature atm❤❤❤
Y'all really not feeling the symbolism in the characters, man. That Drizzy verse was a flawless representation of the groom-to-be. Especially the "I didn't know your secrets they just came to me" line, notice how it cuts to the uncle lookin' old nigga. He caught her ass with Bleu. He know she aint 100% gonna be his nephew wife. Shit Just deep. Oh and THIS IS REAL MUSIC. Not that shitty shooty bang bang lame ass Any-Me or any nigga look like me can be my enemy ass bullcorn. I like some of it tho
All the comments: Plot twist .. great song... Me: damn-👀.... he kinda fine😳😏 Anywayssss love the songg!!!!❤❤
ישראלים כן זה העתקה של עדן חסון
Man this shit nun but auto tune
So let me get this straight either she was clearly settling or she still has a soul ties to him and he has the same for her. She gonna walk away from the person who wanted to marry her and wife her to go be his girlfriend a real one would never
The weffing
feels like Juice WRLD - Lucid Dreams?
Should’ve had drake as the marriage officiant
I like the original version better
Shit will make u beg for ex back n keep them in a loop singing  this
"Don't go build a life without me cause you're mine still" Damn!!!
Drake part shouldn’t have been in here it’s better just to hear your voice 💯💯💯🔥 I love ur music
1. It doesn’t get better w time. 2. If he waited till your wedding day it’s all eg throw that dusty to the side and don’t think if it twice.
Hahahaha am i the only one who thinks he look like that lizard from monsters inc......i just can’t unsee it😂
“Pretty taught me ugly lessons “ BIG FACTS !
Let me beat that thang one one time; and she left her man at the alter. Smh
The  car.
The “mines” in the title is sending me 😖
To be serious, my neighbors are wondering why am I always singing along to this song with passion ......  Maybe I've had my own share of relationship bullshit.  #YouAreMineStill
Song hits different when its actually true
Kinda sounds like that one juice wrld song at least the beat does
No drizzy ?? Wack
Drake ain't init
When ya ex send you this song, when she gotta mans that she left ya for 🤦‍♂️😭🤡
Thinking about the girl I still love who played me :/ 💔

I came here from Boosie Vibing
Man looked like the black default fortnite dude with the beard and big ass jaw 😂😂
Drake pullin jay z moves now missing video shoots
I think Drake is talking about four different lovers who all have sleep problems.
I see all these people saying this is "toxic" because the internet makes them believe it is, when in reality, he probably really do miss her.
Boil I love it congrats bro and its just starting for u take off like a rocket my king!!!
This song caught my attention the first time I heard it. It sounded so familiar and nostalgic, I vibed with it right off the bat. Then I realized it sounded similar to a song I heard from a Korean Drama I watched when I was a kid called "Sassy Girl Chun-Hyang."  The song was called "I love you" by Kim Hyung Sup. Listen to it and tell me it doesn't sound similar 👀👀 https://youtu.be/4JaxfCUxofY
Dis guy is talented a fucking genius
High key when her fiancé looks her he looked so happy then you turn to her and it looks like she faked a smile.
When you really wanted say “betta tell that nigga uu mines , heard you been tryna tie the knot BITCH tell me you lyin” 😂😂yeaa i peeped that parrrttt
I wish my fiancé would try this shit😂😂😂
The music in the beginning sounds like that Juice World song

Str8🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥Defnetiley Havel you wanting to pour it out no cap 😭😭😭😭😭
I’m in love with this song
🤩😍The bride is absolutely stunning ...
Why no one talking about how pretty she is ❤️😍😍😍😍
She waited all the way to her wedding day to leave ole dude on the alter in from of everybody and run back to bleu. Not only was that foul but bleu should know she for the streets if she left her fiancé on at they wedding ceremony. The trick never should of said I do tbh. Hope he kept the receipt to that wedding ring.

Indialove😍😍
The brash feeling broadly fasten because rutabaga ignificantly back outside a hospitable line. aggressive, knotty capital
So adults still think “mines” is the proper way to speak?
🔥🖤💯💯
💯💯💯
gave this bih 19 mil views lol
Where was this video recorded at
Get married and or have children with someone you wished deep down was someone else... settling. Sex is probably not even close to how it is or was with the one that you're actually in love with, settling. You never truly give yourself to the new person because you don't feel that way about them as you did with the ex... settle. I can go on and on. If the good outweighs the bad, be fucking happy!! We got one life to live. You can learn to love but you can't learn to be in love.
Who let this man put an S on Mine 😒
ne: nah fuck my ex he ain’t shit  also me, crying to this song wishing it was different 😔
Why did I read the song title in british slang🤣🤣🤣
i love your music Yung Bleu
he should be one of the best music artist
god I love him music he is so good
They say time heal
Deep emotions💖🙏🏽😪
Good pick on the female. She is Gorgeous😍😍
Im down to do better cause you know I done enough
Why does this song has over 19 million views it sucks
And that’s why y’all are stuck in toxic situations/relationships. I ain’t nobody’s. I’m miss moving on.
its like  Drake ft Drake
Boosie hit a lick with dude
Shit all of it
He is so underrated 😩
I swear I love every single song he makes!!!!
This hits man ☹️
It really didn’t matter if Drake was on it because it was already Fire
I really love this song
Where drakee
India so fine ugh 😩
Finally some smooth rnb
Tbh I’d like to hear him sing this with less auto tune
The part where u went to the church
Well, back to the streets we go sis
Glad you got your gf back
This video takes inspiration from The Graduate (1967) starring Dustin Hoffman and Anne Bancroft. Notice the faces at the very end becoming slowly muted and more confused, a temporary thrill but a sobering "now what?" sets in. Incredible. Yung Bleu not only has a powerful and unique voice but has excellent taste in films as well - a true artist. Can't wait to watch his career continue to rise. History in the making right here. One day i'll be honored to make a beat for this dude. x
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥this tune is a madd thing!!!
💙💙😘
What is the brides name she is beautiful
Hope bro don't get grills cause he got some pearly whites no homo doe😂

Fav song
'Lately she been noticing he ain't me' man got me derr still
I wish the we can change places 🔥🔥
The lyrics not all the way me, but who is, other than that, I like bleu sound/style/delivery.
Do you know how dysfunctional you have to be to marry a man to get the attention of the man you want
Love this
I had never heard this song until boosie was vibing in his car to it. So I googled the lyrics to see who it was. Pretty dope song!
Nice song g

Beautiful song & Message .  But in the name of Jesus ! Don’t talk like that in Gods house baby ! 🗣
They say if you let it go and it comes back then it’s meant to be.   Correction: if you let it go and it comes back it’s trying to pass on a contracted STD
The girl is bad asf

My man  would of done this. 20 years ago we were young and broke up. A dude from my past showed up with a ring. I was like I dont know, other factors had me considering. Not the right reasons.  My husband heard other dude proposed and he told me he would of found us and done  this 😂😂.  Been together for 22 years. My soulmate and my best friend.
This some toxic shit. Of course he would wait until her wedding day to have the courage to admit he wants her still smh
When you enter the church
She super pretty
Are we not going to talk about the fact that drake is invisible
the part about the "hugs" is some real shit
The very beginning
“Your mine*”
What a Savage video 😂
this song is so underrated ive played this like 1000 of times on spotiy
imagine she just ignored him and got married anyways LMAO
she trusted that dress when she was running LMAOOOO
Can anyone find out any info on the wedding dress that India is wearing?? I am looking for something similar minus the shoulder pads!
this song remind me of my ex when i listen to this song i feel like to cry
I never did the Hater music thing !!!! Hating on the next man
Yung Bleu has the same birthday as me (April 4) and this video makes a lot of sense to me. This was me in my toxic days 😭 #Aries
This is such 🔥🔥🔥
2:54 Imagine a man interrupte your wedding day walking in with so much confidence asking your bride to let him hit it one last time. 👀what would you do?💀
Why is mine plural? Mines
What's the girls name ? She is the baddest o seen in a while
This gave me chills. Love it.
I just wanna know who chic in the video... She looks very familiar... Very beautiful
I love this song it's righteous music
If she leaves you at the altar, she is doing you a favor, not to mention confirming what you already knew deep down.
This shit so toxic yet so soothing.
Yo its michell landrys kid u met her before and is friends with your cousin just wanted to say congrats
Greatest song. MEDINA
Hi I have the same one I was.   Book

When you was on every side she looked on

Drake verse so deep
Just toxiccc
Most related song ever, can’t get any better!
Fuck that nigga you can tell him that your mine still 😭♥
💃💃💃💃💃💃💪💪💪💪💪💪🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Favorite part of the video.....um the blue car and running out the church holding my breast up hahaha. Heading back to the streets 🤣
So sad that everyone listening this thinking about someone different 💔
This song lit everybody playing this rn🗣😍🔥

Not walking in the Church and the wedding saying let me beat it up one time.  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Wow feel it deeper than my own veins could
Damn...you've got a banger here!! 🔥🔥💯💯
The hardest thing for a man to  do is keep his family together... What ive done to my kids mother eventually effected me later on in life... And what effects you will effect your kids much stronger... Food for thought...
bruh if that happened to me irl I’d be tight💀
Pray my daughter me and the family make it I don't want to die cause my girl can't see her life without me
“mines” it’s you’re “mine” still..
Drake brought some clout to the song but his verse was unnecessary and had nothing to do with the concept of the record.
Young Bleu on THE RISE
I heard this song when it was at 300 thousand 🤷🏼‍♂️ Ask My Lil Sis💀
I can’t stop listening...

Hello, how are you doing? I hope you are fine. I'm sorry for intruding into your privacy. But I just had to! You know its almost Valentine. just remembering how I spent my last Valentine with my lovely husband. That wouldn't be possible if not for Dr Krishna. Who helped me bring back my husband who had left me for another girl who he was dating outside our marriage. I cried and cried, contacted a lot of spell caster, but they all failed me. I almost lost all my hope of getting my husband back, until I had the opportunity of meeting my old college friend who referred me to Dr Krishna, I told her that he is just another scam, she smiled and told me that Dr Krishna is the only spell caster that can help me. I listened to her, and I contacted him, he only asked for my full name and cell number. And asked me to buy some items required for my spell. 12hours later he told me that he was through with my spellcast. I thought it wouldn't work, and to my uttermost surprise my husband who hasn't called me for months, called me and told me that he wants to come home. He begged for me to accept him back, so that things can go back to the way they were! After ignoring his calls for almost a day, I decided to accept. He came back to me and my kids were very happy that their father came back home. I don't know the problems you are going through now. But I promise you that Dr Krishna is the only answer to all your problems. Contact him today. Pls trust only Dr Krishna. instantsolutiontemple@gmail.com or WhatsApp him now +234 8 1 3 4 1 0 7 3 9 3
Y is she wairing a necklaces with a dress with that kind o neck line though? ??
You will know the truth, and the truth will set you free. They said to him, "We are the family of Abraham and we have never been slaves to anyone." How can you say, "You'll be free"? Jesus replies: "Yes, I tell you, it is the truth: all those who commit sins are slaves to sin.The slave does not always stay in the family. The son stays in the family forever. So if the Son makes you free, you'll be truly free. You do what your father did. They say, "We are not illegitimate children." We have one Father, god. » Your father is the spirit of evil, and you want to do what your father desires. He has been a murderer since the beginning. He never stayed in the truth, because there is no truth in him. His normal way of speaking is to tell lies. Indeed, he is a liar, and he is the father of lies. Good News according to John 8:32 - 36 , 41 , 44 ...
Ugh man🤦🏽‍♂️😫😣

As critical as I am of modern day music, I will give credit to where credit is due, at least they  are promoting marriage.. which is rare nowadays.. it’s time for our culture to go back to having some type of moral values . I pray this is the beginning.
“For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever. Therefore encourage one another with these words. Now, brothers and sisters, about times and dates we do not need to write to you, for you know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night. While people are saying, “Peace and safety,” destruction will come on them suddenly, as labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape. But you, brothers and sisters, are not in darkness so that this day should surprise you like a thief. You are all children of the light and children of the day. We do not belong to the night or to the darkness. So then, let us not be like others, who are asleep, but let us be awake and sober. For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, get drunk at night. But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, putting on faith and love as a breastplate, and the hope of salvation as a helmet. For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ. He died for us so that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with him.” #LordJesusiscoming

Drake shoulda been the guy getting married and rapping to the bride in the video 🤦🏾‍♂️

I finally find the song😩Yessss❤️🔥
Out the park! Why didn't Drake send footage of him for this video? Either way, Smash!
There’s no such word as mines 🙄🙄  It always irks me to hear that word.  Anyways,  Jesus bless everyone.

Right before she says "I do" igniting your flame with your ex and running off with the runaway bride.  Fantasy in a lonely mans head.
What a sad fantasy that never happens in real life.
india love thooooo
So relatable
Why yal break up again bleu ?? Asking for a friend 😂
WHERES DRAKE?!
Besides the beautiful voice hymning the ballad with the sort of a lazy walk of an aimless or desperate man, the video corrupts the basic human decency in which it morally and ethically defies human dignity  by fantasizing, singing, and professing love to a bride standing in front of her groom to be wife and husband!😜
I’m putting a spell on this video that will protect it from a key epic comment 🧙‍♂️

There is no such word as “mines” when referring to something that belongs to a person. The only correct term is “mine”. “Mines” are holes or tunnels

''You should lay it down talk about it when you up''non-renewable 🔥🔥
This is the most important post you will ever read.  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good deeds because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake.  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he conquered death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ;  Except a gift can either be accepted or rejected..So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment; don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you surrender your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. And as it is written (Hebrews 9 : 27) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.  All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ.  https://www.amazon.com/dp/1432117742/ref=emc_b_5_mob_i
She almost as fine as that Impala
🥺❤️
Delight yourself in the Lord 📖nkjv and He will give you the desires of your heart. Psalms 37:4 psalms 84:11, Hebrews 11:6  !!!!!!!!!  HOPE ❤️ Salvation is found in no one else, no other name under heaven given among men where by we must be saved. Saved from the punishment of sin. I’m trying to offer people Hope in absolute perfection !!! No more pain, dying, lies, decay, depression, anxiety, crying, sickness, rotten food, broken things , etc... offering the Hope of Eternity in heaven with Jesus Christ. We must be willing to turn from sin to receive Jesus forgiveness. And to know and live out his teachings. He who does the will of God abides for eternity 1 John 2:17 Visual Bible movies on YouTube

Have always believed in love to cure many things but it only fed my narc’s enormous ego. it is important to be wise when dealing with a narcissist and I’m glad that  darkwebprohack helped cloned my husband’s phone. i got access to his dealings both on phone and social media without touching his phone ,I’m here in Miami Florida USA and able to access my husband’s phone with a cloned app even while his was away in the UK cheating on me.All I did was share my husband’s phone number with darkwebprohack and I was able to read both his new and deleted messages from my phone through a remote link to a programmed app containing cloned cell information without having to touch his phone...my husband was a cheating Narcissist and I’m glad to find out all his secrets and infidelity with the help of darkwebprohack. My husband also tried to use this coronavirus  outbreak as a means to get back to me but I’m not stupid  to allow someone so toxic back into my life, I’m finally going through divorce with a lot of evidence against him. i read all his deleted and recent chat on Whatsapp,Facebook,Instagram and GPS location of his phone at all times, you can contact the great hacker via Gmail (darkwebprohack) or text and speak to him directly on the phone and WhatsApp +19087998357 and I hope you will fund the peace with your heart after finding the truth just like myself

he sounds like future lowkey on some parts
That is one hell of a melancholy chord sequence.
Who came here from a tik tok ad
Lesson learned,, you should always test the dress before the wedding so you can make sure you can run off with your other boo without holding on to your tatas 😌
the auto tune...
https://onlyfans.com/morebaely
Yes, here is a song about a man with zero morals, no charity, no God, no grammar, no job/education/training, & no desire to get married... cooley chiming this woman is his possession and only talks about her body. So it's just another Hollow, Vain, Abusive, Sinful, Unhappy, Dysfunctional Song to which no amount confidence, love, happiness, money, morality, security is produced from this mindset. Nor will it bring you closer to God, this lie and sin is against God's way of life for you. There's better out there.
Mines isn’t a word
For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life. ‭‭John‬ ‭3: 16‬   for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, being justified as a gift by His grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus, Romans 3: 23-24  that if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved; ‭‭Romans‬ ‭10:9‬   Everyone has sinned and needs Jesus to save them. Jesus is universally needed. This world is full of problems and tries to destroy/prevent faith in Jesus. Jesus is the way and we all need Him. We need to read His Word, which is the Bible and join a church and repent and be baptized.
Too much auto tune
👏 😮
This song is just a tweaked version of "Lucid Dreams" and that song is a tweaked version of "Shape Of My Heart". The music industry's creativity engine is dead :/
JAY-Z IS GOD IN REVELATION / APOCALYPSE 11:4 AND MORE. I know this because I have had JESUS tattooed on my thigh since BEFORE I read Revelation 19:16 which says, “ On His thigh is a name written: KING OF KINGS LORD OF LORDS “
Who else thinks the instrumental for the first 25 seconds sounds like Lucid Dreams a little?
"Mines?"
ian even in dis type of Music I like more like geuro 10k and shi Buh dis a banger🗣Ima start listening to Bro more!!!😂
I Usually Never Comment But Daaaaammmmm  ....I Felt this 💙💙💀
this video was ass... but the song was fire
India love is sooooo gorgeous 🙌🏿😍💕
You’re mine* still. you spelled it wrong.
I thought drake would be here
3:46 😍😍
The beginning reminds me of 'Lucid Dreams' by Juice Wrld....Great song too💯
These simp songs need to stop s embarrassing 🤦🏻‍♂️
😌😌😌😌
Shit fire fr 🔥🔥🔥
Jesus love you, he died on the cross for you, accept him as your lord and savior he can change everything. For God so loved the world that he gave his only son, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life" (Jn 3:16"  But you must repent too. From that time Jesus went about preaching and saying, Let your hearts be turned from sin, for the kingdom of heaven is near. (Matthew 4:17)_
Me waiting for drake like ... 👁👄👁🥲😢

Autotune +500,000,000,000
where was drake
That's not drake
This a harmful ass melody
soothing ass voice
Drake was kinda throwin me off with his flow. It's like he recorded his verse before he got the beat. No hate just personally didn't think it was great
People you do realize she literally was fantasizing about buddy the whole video contemplating her decision to even be married. If anything the toxic decision of saying yes is the issue and subsequently leaving with the decision she moved on from. But we all saw the same video and clearly people have a “my truth perspective to it.”
I feel ya

Drake carried hard
Juice wrld beat rip
This beat just like lucid dreams ;( Memories
I'm disgusted!  If a man would be so bold to barge into my wedding like this, he would be leaving out a dead man. Word to everything real and breathing that I love. Any woman that believes this cute, is single and getting exactly what she deserves.  -Cole-
0:00 lucid dream beat kinda
Drake is a dweeb for not being in the video with him.
Would you like to hear some good news? This is the best news you'll hear. Everyone, including you and me, has sinned and fall short of God's glory (Romans 3:23). And because the wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23) you are headed for Hell for eternity. But God graciously offers you the gift of Eternal Life in Jesus Christ. Jesus died for your sins on the cross. He took the punishment you deserve, and He rose again on the 3rd day. If you believe this and confess that you need Jesus as your savior, then you are saved (Romans 10:9,10),  and regardless of what you may have done, there is no condemnation for you if you are in Christ Jesus (Romans 8:1).
Lost in the wind, all we are is Lost in the Wind.

Hope You Don’t mind I’m actually trying to reach out to all 24,000 plus high schools in North America  Quick Example If we multiplied 24,000 high school times 2-4 members of the band in the stands (family and friends) that would be 48million to 96million members in the stands. That’s just talking home team, now if we look at it from this perspective if one team at home is playing football the visitors home field is being occupied playing soccer. That’s a lot of traction word a mouth gets around fast! We ❤️ Have A Plan  A new movement taking North America wide began with an idea to eradicate homelessness and starvation not only North America but the entire 150 million world wide in a video game nba2k20 on PlayStation 4 on the east coast nyc area the plan begins with microgreens implemented pre-K through 5, hemp cultivation 6,7,8  Agriculture specialist 9, 10 and 11 & 12th includes ( revolving all around agriculture skills) environmentalist, economics, safety practices, and lawyers. Bungalows will be constructed out of hempcrete housing North Americas 570,615 homeless and starving In which case there they were learn how to manage 60-120 microgreen flats per adult bungalow occupant that will ship out 40-100 microgreen flats to the rest of the 150 million starving and homeless across the entire plane!  We the people have the right to assemble at the 50 yard line during halftime with marching bands calling for agriculture skills pre-K through twelve all four marking periods no electoral no electives and nothing less than Monday Through Friday Band camp should be next in any other language besides English creating instant dialogue with in the stands of family and friends of members of the band at the 50 yard line during halftime  Have you ever wanted to change things have you ever wanted to make a difference have you ever asked yourself or said to yourself how or if things will ever change or ponder to yourself man there’s so many things that you just don’t understand why they are the way they are well with a movement like this can change all I am not asking you for any donations I’m not asking you to sign any petitions what I am asking people to do is take initiative at the 50 yard line during halftime with the utilization of our Bill of Rights 1 through 10 and call for Agriculture skills pre-K through twelve all four marking periods no electoral no electives nothing less than Monday Through Friday Band camp should be next in any other language besides English creating instant dialogue with in the stands of family and friends of members of the band at the 50 yard line during halftime No more war no more starvation only unification and multiplication  WE THE PEOPLE HAVE HAD ENOUGH AND WE WANT CHANGE AND WE ARE GOING TO CHANGE NOW!!!!🎺🎺🎺 We must unite stop toxifying our Mother Earth and come together as The Eternal Creator intended have a blessed day ❤️❤️👍🏻👍🏻🎺🎺⭐️⭐️👍🏻✊🏽👍🏿👍🏽👍🏼👍🏾👍🏻🤝🎺✅✅🥁🥁🥁🥁      Genesis Chapter 1 בְּרֵאשִׁית  א  בְּרֵאשִׁית, בָּרָא אֱלֹהִים, אֵת הַשָּׁמַיִם, וְאֵת הָאָרֶץ.	1 In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.   ב  וְהָאָרֶץ, הָיְתָה תֹהוּ וָבֹהוּ, וְחֹשֶׁךְ, עַל-פְּנֵי תְהוֹם; וְרוּחַ אֱלֹהִים, מְרַחֶפֶת עַל-פְּנֵי הַמָּיִם.	2 Now the earth was unformed and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep; and the spirit of God hovered over the face of the waters.   ג  וַיֹּאמֶר אֱלֹהִים, יְהִי אוֹר; וַיְהִי-אוֹר.	3 And God said: 'Let there be light.'

I had a dream at like 4 in the morning that Jesus came back.It started off as me and some of family were in this building I don’t remember if it was a church but it gave off that impression. I don’t remember what the people looked like who owned it but they were so nice and we loved it. But throughout the dream these people kept following me and my family when we went into the building and they looked like fbi or something “they weren’t but they looked like it” so we ran from them whenever they came. This happened like 3 times. Through this we learned there’re was something off about the place, but didn’t know what. We knew that were messed up and killed people. Eventually the people just came into the building and said we want to show you something. They opened a door in the back of the building and it had a huge cross from the ceiling to the floor. With little crosses on the wall around it. I clicked that they kill Christians. I remember in my dream saying I’m done and ready to walk out. But they locked the door and wouldn’t let us out. They told us how they don’t like Jesus and their true colors came out. I was arguing back saying He is real and I prayed in my dream that He would help us. The people started gathering together and talking and I looked out a door or window and saw all these colors. These flashes of color until it made the night look like day. And I heard the loudest beep in my life. I remember in the dream saying yes Thank you Jesus He’s coming. I woke up right then. The time is near have faith repent get right with God. Material things mean NOTHING.

Drake really saving careers😂

I guess drake no more hmmm
I STILL SEE YOUR SHADOWS IN MY ROOM
Literally how New mex relationships be asf 🔥💨
This could have been a great song. Even with Drake but, the verses...Good opening line then, something crude or juvenile ruins it. The mixing of casual sex cliches or, gangsta&ghetto love with the "true love" theme are directly in contrast with each other. It's one or the other brotha. Poor songwriting and misplaced swag killed what could have been a classic.

Wow really took the lucid dreams beat and changed it a little.
❤ hey fam, if you reading this I want to remind you that God loves you and he has a wonderful plan for your life! 😁  God forbid If you died suddenly today, where do you think you would spend eternity??... If you are not sure, God wants to let you know that he loves you very much and that this is REAL LOVE — not that you loved God, but that he loved you FIRST by sending his Son Jesus to die for you to take away all of your sins that you would not perish but have everlasting LIFE!   Gods love for you cannot be measured, it has no boundaries and will look past all your faults. God saved me and set me free from a lifestyle of sin and addiction back a few years ago and my life has never been the same since. God can do the same for you if you allow him. "Behold, I’m standing at the door, knocking. If your heart is open to hear my voice and you open the door within, I will come in to you and feast with you, and you will feast with me." (Rev. 3:20) God wants a RELATIONSHIP with you! Its not too late! He loves you!  The bible says in Romans 6:23 that the  wages of Sin is DEATH! But the free gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord and Saviour!! Romans 10:9 & 13 says that WHO EVER CALLS ON THE NAME OF JESUS AND BELIEVES IN THEIR HEART AND CONFESSES WITH THEIR MOUTH THAT HE IS LORD SHALL BE SAVED!!  Im going to say a prayer for you! Lord bless my friend and their family with a long and healthy life. Lord I pray you make yourself real to them like you did for me in Jesus name. Friend, If you would like to receive Jesus in your heart or rededicate your life to him, then right where you are say this with me with your heart and lips outloud...  Dear Lord Jesus, come into my heart, forgive me of all my sins, wash me and cleanse me, set me free. I believe that Jesus died for me and that he is coming back again for me. Fill me with your Holy Spirit. Jesus make yourself real to me. I accept you today as my Lord and Saviour. I'm born again, all my sins are forgiven, I'm on my way to heaven because Jesus is in my heart!  Friend if you've said that prayer, I pray that from this day forward your life will never be the same. I tell you today that all your sins are forgiven, and always remeber dont run from God but run to him because God Loves You and has a plan for your life!  If you prayed with me, plz type amen! https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=900241527115892&id=100013901589755  God bless!😁     Don't believe in God??  Proof in the links!...👇  From crackhouse/drug dealer in Wash DC to Pastor! Depressed to the point of having a 40 cal to the head, TO  COMPLETELY SET FREE AND DELIVERED BY THE POWER OF GOD!

Drake wanted to sound like Durk SOOO BAD in this one.
india need a ring fr.
Now why wasn’t Drake in the video?
People people Drake is not in the video because he is in Canada and Canada has our asses blocked from the border thanks to COVID and he isn’t leaving Canada who has our American asses blocked to come make a video. Draaake!!! “If we ever made you angry just know that it gets better with time “🎶
Love from 🇳🇬
Big up yourself youth good song 💯💯✊
And I don't wanna go unless u make me.....
Who hear from tik tok
nas
The shorty in the video would make me bust thru them doors the same way  she tough 💪🏾
Drake's part tho💯💯💯
🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣💨💨💨💨💨🐐🐐🐐🐐
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Just the right amount of toxicity I needed to hear
Let me clarify for people. Tiktok does not technically ruin songs or just make them popular. There are two categories to this phenomenon.   Category 1, nostalgia: this happens when person one has been listening to a song or artist for years and usually has nostalgic memories attached to it. When this person sees the song or artist get more recognition the rare nostalgic memory begins to fade and being replaced with memories of Charlie demelo dancing. This will cause person one to get mad at tiktok and new listeners. Person one can often be found saying, "I remember when this song came out" "this song is so nostalgic" "who knows this song not from tiktok". Person one can sometimes be called a "gate keeper". Songs in this category include: hopelessly devoted, future brake up song, put your head on my shoulder and more  Category 2, pop song: a song gets popular and person two is enjoying the song. They scroll through tiktok but while they are scrolling they keep hearing the same song over and over again so the get sick of it and move on. This is why songs that stayed at the top of charts like "old town road" and "despasito" are going extinct because tiktok has us going through songs way to fast. Songs in this category include: savage, WAP, excitment, say so and many more.  Notice how tiktok dosen't just "make songs popular" (new listeners from cadigory 1 or late listeners from cadigory 2) it milks the hell out of songs till they get old  Notice how tiktok never "ruins songs" (gate keepers from cadigory 1 and early listeners from cadigory 2) it just messes up the nostalgia factor for person one
This video pisses me off why you let her put on the dress if she’s “yours” that’s not romantic at all
Its a vibe🔥🔥🎼🔊🎶
Is Deyontah Wilder one of the groomsmen or nah?
This is a masterpiece
This how I feel  ...... Facts ... 🎶🎶🎶🔊🙆🏿‍♂️
India is so pretty 😍😍😍
Pretty Face, Pretty tempting but Pretty taught me Ugly lessons, Pretty Had me giving more than I was getting, so if Pretty don't come with something well then I outdeadit Ashamed to tell my friends how much I do for you cause they know you wouldn't do the same for me...  What a verse 🤔

Did I miss the drake verse?
I saw this video as this couple had wrong timingbinbbeing together. They had lessons and growth to do. They had an undeniable connecrion. Not all the time a door is shut because they don't need to be in your life. Sometimes spirit will shut a door to force us to heal and grow into who we are. Sometimes it brings us back together and sometimes it doesn't. Your spirit knows what you need and want. Listen to it. Too many times we are looking but our head and not our heart. I saw this video as following your heart. What's best for you! Other ppl will tell you to walk but they don't know the full story, what spirit has showed you and what you feel and why you feel it. You just know. My best life experience is fuck what other people say, you do what you feel is best for you and learn and grow as you go thru these experiences. You know whats best for you over anyone. Live love and laugh b3 happy at all costs and always choose yourself!
Take care Drake is back 🔥
This is an example of keeping that door close don’t forget that y’all broke up for a reason y’all . Heal and move on
I wasnt looking for your secrets they just came to me..
I loved ❤️🙏🏽
The homely learning joly untidy because step-sister atypically play alongside a spiteful dash. alleged, classy mallet

sending love to you from Africa brother yung bleu
The perfect croissant morally alert because keyboard delightfully influence aboard a nimble kale. imaginary, warlike edger
From the look she gave him at 2:43 once he smiled at her just shouts to me that girls just want to have fun. In this case she thought she was ready to settle down with what seems to be a man who follows the normal path opposed to Yung bleu, a live in the moment guy, who is not predictable which provides the girl with thrills she’ll never forget. This music video has so many ways you could interpret it. Good ass music video.
Penting??!  https://youtu.be/2y2GGA4G-2s

Who else mad drake wasn’t in the video ?🤦🏾‍♂️
Gotta get drake in here
✨Fuckin Banger ✨

Everything about this song is perfect! ❤️❤️

Whoever is reading this... YOU ARE ENOUGH!!😘🥰❤️❣️
I do not get how this is toxic. Girl dont love the dude. The ex came over to help her see that clearer. And she chose happiness and love over pretense. It is only toxic if it is one sided lol.
Dammmm🥺🥺
Bruh this song is the shit
Love this songgggg❣❣❣
If you think your too late it’s not till they sign them papers.You still have time even after the wedding to get him/her back

Are y'all ready for 2021
i dont know why but this song makes me so sad. am i the only one that feels that way?
I been here since 5:00 so about a hour and 30 minutes on replay 🙂😽
I need about 30 more of these collabs
The Lord Jesus Christ came into the 🌎world to save sinners. Whoever believes and repent shall be saved! The Lord is abundant in mercy and kindness forgiving any and all sins but by no means will he clear the guilty! After 100,000,000,000,000,000 years there is still no way out! How dumb is to live for sin and 🐍 evil! But Flee to Jesus Christ, he won't cast into hell anyone that comes to God through him! There is no other name given to men that men ought to be saved! Only in Jesus Christ is their salvation from hopelessness, sins and hell. Follow the Holy Bible it is a Lamp to our 👣 feet. Many think that they are right with God because some childhood faith or creed! But my friends God is holy and if he did not spare the angels that sinned, but subjected the whole creation under a curse, what makes you think God will spare you?  6And all humanity will see God’s salvation.’ ” 7Then John said to the crowds coming out to be baptized by him, “You brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the coming wrath? 8Produce fruit, then, in keeping with repentance. And do not begin to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ For I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham Now repent and turn to Jesus Christ the only one that can save us. Repent and flee to him I beg you. Be reconcile to God in through Jesus Christ.  .…
Pls get toosii on dis bihh

Soooo. My ex hasn’t spoken to me in months. Sent her so many emails and she never responded until I sent her this video, she called me crying the next day saying she was sorry for how she had been acting and wanted to work things out... I’m not sure if it was the song that got her to reach out but I’m pretty sure it was... Thank you 🙏
Who produced this song it has such a dancehall/reggae or African vibe?
Ofc Drake didn’t show up to the vid he only does when he really rates the artist🤣🤣🤣🤣

I spent a majority of my youth pretending to be someone I wasn’t. I wanted so desperately to be cool, to be noticed, to be liked..I didn’t like who was staring back at me in the MIRROR. I LIED to sound interesting, I LIED to appear funny, I LIED to get anyone to notice me. I wanted GIRLS to notice me...I was constantly chasing that relationship with ANYONE.. Since 2nd grade, constantly seeking the opposite sex. In 6th grade, I began to think about sex..alot I began to “self satisfy” any chance I got. Looking back at the habits I developed in that mindset...it makes me hang my head in shame. My Grandparents divorced, my parents divorced..it only made sense I was seeking that “intimacy”...any intimacy would do the job.. Habits I developed in my youth, overflowed and poured over into my Adulthood..almost cost me my marriage, my relationship with my children..it almost cost me my LIFE..  🩸🩸🩸🕊🕊🕊 I don’t write this, in search of pity.. I don’t share this, to tell you a story.. YOU ARE READING THIS RIGHT HERE AND NOW IN THIS MOMENT, because YOU made a choice, to watch this video and scroll through the comments, like you have always done.  But this time is different, because THIS is the moment someone brought you the good word 🙏🏽 That there is a God that sits on high, and he is waiting for you. He is waiting for you to lift up the past you’ve let drive your present, up to him! He is waiting for you to pull away from the habitual sin you have been living in! He is waiting for you to shout his name in praise on your darkest nights! He is waiting for you to stop asking the questions that don’t matter, and dig into his word! Waiting for you to take hold of the fact he sent his son to die the death that YOU AND I DESERVE!! Waiting for you to dig into his word for your redemption! The redemption that awaits the vessel developed in love, the vessel with the royal blood of heaven flowing through its veins!  This is for you!! The one who couldn’t stare in the mirror, the one who died!! This is for the one that HAS NO OTHER PLACE TO GO..BECAUSE THE LORD OUR GOD FOLLOWS US INTO THE DEEPEST PLACES, THE DARKEST PLACES, JUST TO TELL US HOW MUCH HE LOVES US, AND HAS PLANS TO PROSPER YOU AND TO NEVER HURT YOU!!  LOOK INTO THE MIRROR!! LOOK DEEP INTO YOUR OWN EYES!! PREACH TO YOURSELF!! TALK TO YOUR HEAVENLY FATHER AND ACCESS THE PATH THAT LEADS TO HIS GLORY, TO HIS WILL!!  Look into the mirror, acknowledging that you have FOUND GOD, and begin your WALK WITH GOD..by developing a relationship with his son, our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ 🕊🕊🕊  LOOK INTO THE MIRROR...  And start the habit of seeing YOURSELF, the way GOD SEES YOU..  Created in his image, beautifully made, for MEANING AND PURPOSE  🕊🕊🕊🩸🩸🩸  🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽Glory be to God!!🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽  If you have read this far, God bless you, if you have a few minutes listen to my NEW song “Mirror Image” on my page. Shut down everything else and join me as I  share many of the thoughts that I had with MYSELF, while looking into the mirror.. Join me as I talk to the man staring back at me, my MIRROR IMAGE 🕊🩸🙏🏽 https://youtu.be/4B3E1tQzgAc  🕊🙌🏽

This song hit different man. You incredibly talented my g. Just wait you gon be on top wit your voice and you flow man. Unique.
🔥🔥🔥
The crazy thing now they start back where they left off in a toxic relationship
the music of the song sounds familiar but i cant remember what other song it sounds like 😭
Let me guess... U never took her seriously when she wanted commitment, you kept her hanging on, and now when she found someone who has balls to marry her, your ego kicked in, then you wrote this song for her. Guess what, probably you reapin what you sow. 🤷 You are lucky that she's dumb enough to take u back 😂 (probably you will treat her just like how u did before)

Ima genie in a bottle babyyyy
This man is the personification of a toxic ex. The pain on the woman's face, it is likely he treated her like crap. He only wants her back now because she is about to marry someone else. But best believe, if he gets her back, he will go back to treating her badly.
I play this song at least 10 times a day.
Drake couldn’t even show up for the music video smh
🔥🔥

Toxic song yk what that means we need a future remix
Repent and believe in the Gospel of Jesus Christ before it's too late, God loves you!   For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;   Romans 3:23 KJV   But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.   Romans 5:8 KJV   For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.   Romans 6:23 KJV   that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.   Romans 10:9 NKJV   For God so loved the world, that He gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.   John 3:16 KJV     God loves you, Jesus loves you! Repent and believe in Jesus Christ today with a sincere heart in faith, and by the grace of God you will inherit the gift of eternal life! If you believe in Jesus you will NEVER die! (John 11:25) God bless you!

Bleu plus Drake Bleu Going Up ‼️🔥
he did not actually wanna see her happy, it was the memories that kept them still having those feelings and the control he had to go to that wedding and ruin her life over again.  that's plain toxic.

This video played as an ad and I watched the whole thing then clicked 'visit advertiser' so i could add it to a playlist and watch it/listen to it again.. And it brought me to Jack Harlow's page? Good thing I remembered some of the lyrics and googled it to find the song again, cuz id have been pissed. Lol

Lucid dreams sample
The instrumental is giving me lucid dream vibes
I love this song and the video was nice too.
Legends say that we still waiting for Drake's verse.
7mill view its me
Tbe smoothest transitions I've seen 👽💯
My favorite parts are 0:14 he seen her wedding picture and immediately drove there, 0:57 shes thinking of her ex. 1:57 he arrived and knocked and let her know shit ain't dead. And 3:41 when she took his hand... my only question how did yall make a perfect song🔥😞
I had someone tel me to come listen to this song....and I started crying 💔 because he was the one who hurt me....some won’t ever understand how they really destroy others....I love this song though
Mindset/ on scrutiny check my 2 Eps if you a artist I’ll or entrepreneur I’ll show some love back!! Less get it  Instagram-nice1wun  https://music.apple.com/us/album/mindset-single/1546502259  https://music.apple.com/us/album/scrutiny-single/1546490952
Bleu's voice is intoxicating
Why drake aint do the video
Who is the girl in the video in the wedding dress ?
The dress is from where 😩
This tune is hard
🔂
https://youtu.be/9Q9HmcUEAng check out YM Lil Quez
If pretty don’t come with something, well then I dead it
This songs breaks me and builds me all at the same time.... Who else is here hurting but healing?
Drake needed about 6 more verses in this. It’s fucking such a banger wow.
Why isn’t Drake in the video.
she don’t wanna go to sleep she angrrrrrrryyyyyy
🤟🤟🤟👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽💪🏽 🔥 🔥
❤️🔥
☝🏽🔥🔥🔥🔥
The youthful nation rationally terrify because eel implicitly disagree forenenst a damaged acknowledgment. whole, attractive firewall
I hope u find what u looking 4 Cus I haven't Medina
But I’ma lightskin for feelin like this any 😭🤦🏽
The most successful people started from nothing. They didn’t wait for the opportunity to knock but created the opportunity on their own, worked hard and made history. Mr Dennis @Dennis__forex09 on Insta. is a legendary binary options trader. I will always recommend him for your trade..
You ain need drake on this tho
Just a great song nd video all together
Only if you knew the story https://youtu.be/AGjW5V7_MSY
I am sorry  that you have to go through that man many pepoppole go through that
Sounds like Lucid Dreams
"they say time heals dont go build a life witout me cause your mines still" 😖 this song stay on repeat
Nice  song please s.u.b me my super friends please help me lovely peoples
Certified Gold!!!!!😁
My first time watching this video and I can’t stop replaying it. It’s good asf‼️
the way he just barged into the church 😂
"Pretty taught me ugly lessons "
The girl in the thumbnail be looking like Michael Jackson
An adjective and a color is rappers names now....lol okey he's gonna get old and still have the same name lol
I'm sad that drake showed his voice and lyrics on someone that's a waste of time.
India Westbrook  is so fucking Gorgeous , I came for her honestly pretty self.
this is a intriguing twist
What’s the girl name
My ex sent me this song tf kinda bullshit is this. What surprise that cheating will lead to an end of a relationship.  That last second chance that y'all  dont deserve hits different when theres no more chances to be given out 😏  but you reap what you sow 🤷🏻‍♀️
If just one person reads this it will make my day. I'm a music artist from New York. So I'm fully aware that ppl usually post these comments all the time, but I honestly do believe that I'll be the one person who you'll be so happy that you did hear out. I'm currently trying to get 1,000 subscribers.. If ONE PERSON could just give this a thumbs up, you will be a great step closer to helping a person's dreams come true. I swear that Im not wack and you won't be disappointed. I Just need one chance and 2 minutes. Thank you.
"Pretty face, pretty tempting. But pretty taught me ugly lessons." This verse by Drake from Yung Bleu's 'You're Mines Still' remix has as much potential as any of his solo tracks. People relate to Drake & his music as he speaks on real life-real people issues, the good & the bad.
You see all this and know all of this, so why is it that "some" of you'll be RIGHT BACK in the sheets again? Smh.😉
3:43 is not a toixc
Drakes verse is so relatable to my situation right now
Brings me back 2 heven and hell again Medina  #scaryhours2
This is a very good song
Sad😵😵
Not you
It amazes me how many comments talk about how they should have just let it go but if she would have married the new guy it was only because she forced herself to move on and within a year the new guy would be getting cheated on because he's not what she wanted. Wounds heal but they never go away.
Look at India breaking hearts again
https://youtu.be/tH7S5enyGDc
The beginning of the song reminds me the pre-chorus topline of "Hello" by Adele, on the chords of "Shape of My heart" by Sting
Love it
Came here for Drake... Left disappointed.
DAMN I REALY LISTENED TO THIS SONG JUST NOW THATS HOW I FEEL ABOUT MY GIRL THAT LEFT ME DOPE TRACK NO CAPPP BUT BESIDES THAT DJ SLEEP GOT THE STREETZ ON LOCK https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-J5qudNSs7gR9PlBVJZDwQ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIbitpDU5NQ SUBSCRIVIIBBBBBEEE SUBSCRIVIBBBEEEE DOPE SONG SLEEP TYPE BEATZ

Wish drake was in the video
💔
The barbarous supply neuroanatomically queue because brow ultrastructually level underneath a probable capital. nostalgic, detailed multimedia
Am I the only one who genuinely wants there ex back not because they’re gonna move on but because you feel that’s your person regardless of the issues that happen and as a man I want to own up to my wrong and change for myself and her ?
Honestly one of the most heart warming comment sections I've ever come across. Sending healing powers and love to you all. 🌻💛
This song is beautiful
🔥🔥🔥🇯🇲🔥🔥🔥🔥 https://youtu.be/qS2qZ-U1ymk
the word toxic dont fit every situation. sometimes, its just wrong timing.

Drake's verse..i took it personal.
I’m all most certain that the guitar melody is from Craig David rise and fall (a small snippet )
Love this song it’s beautiful
This song a banger🔥🔥
Banger drake helping artist that are talented
Man this song hits the few relationships that I wish I could get back but life has too move forward.

When he said bitch when the word was girl, I felt that
I love that Drake let this young man and woman shine alone in the video.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DTuqFlg8cM
It just shows you fellas even with all the success Drake has, he still has women problems, money is still a topic of conversation with diff pitfalls and his closest people have done him wrong. He just deals with his pain in a Rolls or a mansion.
Now how you gonna walk in church and repeat that line...😋😂
Who is the female model love interest?!
2:54 Not in church 😂😂😂
I just saw this video as a ad and I’m glad I ain’t skip it cause this actually a cool ass song to vibe to 😩

Drake out of pocket for not being in the video... nigga could of atleast use his iphone or something
its never the same when the featured artist doesn't show up in the visual
The lame distribution only appear because tiger postprandially use versus a annoyed column. fuzzy , xenophobic debtor
Lol I ain’t never seen someone so toxic and classy at the same time
I swear I saw this music video ages before, or am I just tripping?
India love! Great choice
I think 1Mill of the views came from me alone...this song is so simple plus the fact that the whole world can relate to it, makes it that 🔥🔥
Ali gatie lite
He gets me in my feelings.  Finally a man who is affectionate and express his feelings. Whew Lord talk about TOXIC ‼️‼️‼️ I keep hitting REPLAY. I see why he call himself Bleu Vandross ❣️❣️❣️❣️
Bruh. This is the most therapeutic comment section OF ALL TIME
Durkioo!
Listen to the song on 0.75x speed nice and relaxing 🔥
Anybody know who shawty is in real life 😍?
Still feel like Drake should’ve been in the video !
what girls @ ? Help needed here
U never need new stuff u just gotta make the old stuff look good 🤟🏽
🔥I'm a 17 year old musical artist with a heavy passion for music💯 it would make my day if you would give my songs a listen. Greatly appreciated🔥
Love this video, love the song, love the lesson 😌
He should say ( and i know she had a nigga but she never brought it up ) instead cause I definitely feel that. been there done that 😭
I came to look at India 😍😋
@1:21
Who was pumping out the song before the music vid dropped?
Drake?
The whole video is FIRE.  I LOVE the fact when you seen she was getting married you went to go get her.  The fact that she was getting married and she knew her heart was with you. You could see she knew this was a mistake.  The part when you say time heals dont go build without me cause you mine still.  This video was me all the way 2008.  I'm in love with this video. People get married everyday to someone whom their heart is not with the other person. Keep up the good work. I'll would like to know what made you make this song. Your ideas was fire.
I fucking love this song 😭🔥💛
Relatable af rn
Singer from canada 🇨🇦?
My favorite part was every man she looked at looked like him. Still in love with him.
Mine still 💖
Who knew this before tiktok? ✨🙌

Sounds like they sampled Juice WRLD’s ‘Lucid Dreams’, can anyone else hear it in the music?
This is the drake we need
What’s the girl in the video ig?
Drake said some powerful things in his verse, things that I'm currently going through 😔
“Pretty face, pretty tempted But pretty taught me ugly lessons Pretty had me givin' more than I was gettin' So if pretty don't come with somethin', well, then I dead it Ashamed to tell my friends how much I'd do for you 'Cause they know that you would never do the same for me”
This man is so creative so talented visuals are on vocals are on typical life situations this man has an old soul
never been in a relationship but idk why its still relatable 😭😭

Did you hear DRAKE?
Would have liked a little less autotune but other than that mint song ❤️
Lucid dreams ? 😧 I know Im not trippin but that sounds like the lucid dreams juice wrld sampled but in a different tone or something is switched just a smidget but I like this song
My fav part was when u and the girl ran out and when u went to the church to get yo girl❤️
It’s weird how the guitar strings in the beginning sounds similar to Lucid Dreams a little
T9ine really poppin out wit dis new shii4️⃣3️⃣🔥🤫
Tbh we all have that one person we'd leave our own wedding for. But, when the time comes we know they wont be there because they no longer care.
Dont let sting see this, he finna take all your profits like he did juice
I have a song I feel cuts just like this one  and I do love this song💯💪🏾
Dope!
Pretty taught me ugly lessons u know if u know

My Question Is Where's Drake?
Drake should’ve been in the video. And the hair and eyelashes look terrible.
Definetley the soundtrack to me and my Ex..as toxic as they come.. but as time heals..scars remain... 💔

BRUH! Can we stop normalizing toxicity. Ol dude was bout to make an honest women outta her and she gave that up because a male  bust through the doors talking bout “let me have sex with you one more time cuz I know you be Fienning for me” and BOOM! She left.      I like the song doe 👀
🔥🔥🔥💕
Wow nice
India is a sweet one
The intro guitar chords are similar to Sting "The shape of my heart" and it has been used by Craig David in Rise & Fall feat the man himself. It has always been a banger so no wonder yours is 🔥🔥🔥
Most toxic song ever
The tatt on her face tells me everything i need to know to stay far far away from her

It was her facial reaction when he said "let me beat that pvssy up one more time"  for me!  This song actually made me go check out Yung bleu's discography and i must say i'm glad i did. he literally made no bad song for me. Loving every bit of it.

This must be that song 69 was talking about “we got him a drake feature and everything he just not blowing up”
Where drake😂

✌🏾🖐🏾☝🏾
Don’t go building a life without me cause you mine still I FELT THAT  💖💜🧡💛💚
I know them type of hugs.
In the beginning it sounded like juice wrld
The autotune😒
Demonic ass song
I have someone who I feel like that about. Been knowing each other 30 yr. I remember we would check on each other over the years & one time he messaged me if I was married yet & I said naw are you married & he said nope. I was almost, but I felt like I would have had to be with him sexually one last time before I got married. So I ended up giving  the ring back anyway because of relationship toxic issues . A little over a year later & way after I ended my relationship I started reconnecting with the guy that will always have a big chunk of my heart ♥️♥️♥️♥️
Yoooo just had to appreciate our black men in this video
Drake should’ve been in the video as the priest 🤦🏾‍♂️ smh

Yung Bleu so slept on 🤦🏽‍♂️
Melodie stolen from Michael Jackson- Fall again!!Long lives the King!
This song sucks, the video sucks, his voice with whatever efffects is torture to hear
When they ran away
Best song to close this 2020 :)
offbeat rappers still getting famous in 2021?
The ending was so powerful in such a subtle way, happiness over history at all times and at any costs. We fall in love with the idea of our past and wanting an old flame back knowing that flame was put out for a reason, reminiscing about the good times but in reality every closing door is meant to be closed. What’s even crazier is the fact that this video is an exact representation of how much healing a person can actually do or try to do, move on almost get married, literally she was standing there at the alter with her NEW MAN and decided to reopen a door that was meant to stay shut, the past can also wreak havoc on the present if you let it , she gave up her marriage for a fantasy that will never be a reality. AMAZING video Bleu, definitely hits home for everyone.
BEST SONG OF 2020!!!!
Closure. Com ! #TrustsNo1
this such a drake song lol at least he stay true to himself
Walai men be trying us😭😭......dope song though❤️
Shoutout to young bleu being there in every break up I had them lyrics hit completely different

Typical lightskin leading video girl love India tho
I know them type of hugs😔
Smh immature. Instead of saying “lemme beat the pvssy up one time” he should’ve said  I know what I did to your heart was a crime I’ll pay restitution til everything fine Without you in my life how will stars align  You know you’ll always be a star in my eyes  Something like that to make someone leave from the alter
Drake go missing ?😂
The more i watch and listen the more it speaks volumes , how toxic codependent  relationships  really be
I wonder why drake wasnt in the actual video
When I heard the first melody, I thought it was juice wrld's lucid dreams.
I know we know this already but Drake Sincerely does not miss 🥲
Yeah this a hit
3:01 "I know this nigga ain't about to crash my wedding foo"
Song dedicated to my ex🤣
Lucid dreams sample

This song hard as hell bro
💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
Hella gay he shoulda put the original song
It's the dress for me
That wedding dress tho.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The 2k dislikes are from the people who got this song stuck in their head
Moral of the story. Don't compromise your love, if you're not happy.
Was with the same girl for 5 years and two months ago she left me for another guy who she had been seeing for two months and told me she loves him and wants to marry him but she always will love me but we have to move on. I lowkey agree but there are times I want to be toxic and drag out the ending that already happened. This song is too relevant as I now understand the anxiety and sadness that stems from knowing you may not experience such a deeper or better love again as well as being replaced and rejected by someone you looked out for
Damn this shi hellaaa good🥵
Any one know what type of car that was???????
" Shape of my heart" is if youre searching for the first melody.. thank me later
India Love is the most beautiful bride i ever seen.
כל מי שיקשיב לכך יקבל השראה מיידית⏹⏺⏹⏺⏹⏺⏹

If only Drake was in this video. Imagine he could have been one of the groomsmen 😔
WHATS WITH THE AUTO TUNE i THOUGHT WE PAST THAT FINALLY BUT NOOO.... IT RUINED THE WHOLE SONG AND ALL IT DOES IS MAKE AN ALREADY BAD VOICE SOUND WORSE , CLEARLY. CAUSE IF HE HAD A GOOD VOICE WHY WOULD HE NEED AUTOTUNE AUGH NEXXXXTT
I’ve been in a toxic relationship for 2 years and it’s still rocky but one thing I can say is I am in love with him and ima keep trying to love him better I can’t let the loml go because shit gets hard ima always keep trying and getting better each time!
YOHANAN(JOHN/JUAN) 14:6 "I AM THE WAY AND THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE. NO ONE COMES TO THE FATHER EXCEPT THROUGH ME" "YO SOY EL CAMINO Y LA VERDAD Y LA VIDA. NADIE VIENE AL PADRE SINO POR MI"......

“They say time heals” prob the best part
I'm a 26 year old app developer myself and will be introducing a new messaging app in 2021 to connect android & iphone users. the target  is military deployed personal & families, elderly, out-of state college students, homeless, business men. I know some will say there's plenty of messaging apps out already as that maybe true they don't protect your privacy in doing so you cant trust them in 2021 were changing the game.
0:41😩💯
Why TF isn't Drake in this video??! I'm crushed lol 🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️💔 But nonetheless amazing song, amazing video! Loved how they actually portrayed the emotions in the song through the video 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 Great visual
الله عليك تحفة
Didn't realise how toxic this song actually is
What’s the girls ig
What's happening y'all.TEEJAY M.A.E here and I'm a MALE SINGER asking for your support with subscribing to my YouTube Channel below  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmYfE6b3a1bwBz6Mbt6IJeQ
Tell me why this drake verse could be on Take Care
Africans are really taking over the scene
Seriously though what do you do and where do you go after running from the alter !?
Honestly India has good facial expressions for acting I hope she keeps doing videos
India so pretttyyyyy 💕💕💕💕
Definition of toxic 🤣🤣🤣🔥🔥🔥
Toxic relationship anthem
Acoustic instrumentals giving me lucid dream vibes
My nigga talkin reckless in the house of the lord 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I know those type of hugs 🥲
🔥🔥🔥
I love this song because when you are veteran in love you have definitely been on this battlefield but all my people do not fall for the trap, you split from that person for a reason! Do not romanticize the good times you had together and turn a blind eye to the toxicity those good times were probably drowning in. There is no such thing as a clean slate with an old flame...YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED! Dope ass song though...for healing...not going back in time ladies and gentleman.
This song is a masterpiece
Ima play the sh** out this song 🥴😂💯
Song deso but all that Auto-Tune kills it😳
Love this song . Feel like the video could have been better for such a fire song
Does anyone else hear juiceWrlds beat sounds
this song is so understanding ! 🖤
Bleu wave 🤍🌊
We’re healing now ✨ 🙏

Them grooms men woulda whooped his ass if he came up in the church like dat. lol

Why he look like Juju smith
How could you make a video without Drake in it tho 🤯🤦🏽‍♂️🦉
the first time i listened to this i cried , reminds me of my boy well hes no longer mine but hes my soulmate
Anybody know the name of the song he  sampled  this from listen to beginning?
What song does this sound like? too familiar
lil durk work have worked too drake still dope too
"Fuck that nigga tell him you mine still"  .... BRB messaging my ex
Nice song
Cardo B. They made a song for u !    Smoke up to it .....
I love yung bleu..
fun fact the music title isn’t grammatically correct, it’s “you’re mine still” not “you’re mines still”
This is exactly how I pictured things in my head when I listened to this song 🥲🥲
thought this was Yung Bleu ft. Tory Lanes
i love her lashes !!!!! she’s so pretty
India looking so good
This clip is so toxic i thought this was directed by Future
Way to make the most of not having Drake in the video
Once I heard Drake on the remix I stopped going back to my ex.. I knew 6ix taught me well🦉
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

Sounds like juices beat in the beginning
drake literally just says some real ass shit,  that nigga ain't even trying to make a fire song. literally just getting his shit off lmao
Wasn’t expecting such a high quality music video! Definitely an A+ Although the only downside is no Drake in it
Love the cadence and timbre of his voice. Your singing is amazing brother.
Anyone noticed that the guitar in the background is from lucid dreams
First Yung Bleu song and I just know he sings for the soul
Damn india love still bad🔥🔥
Immaculate just immaculate
Drake stay helping MFs 😭
Imagine tellin shorty let me beat again in a church full of her family and her fiancé lol
India is Top 3 rn
Genius video
Damn Drake really heartbroken this time
her lashes on point
the dynamic of this song is so relatable and also shows how it can be hard to let go which can either be a good thing or cause a toxic relationship. glad i found this song and this artist. keep up the good work bro
Mine ****
Timeless song💯💯💯💯
This should’ve just been the Druski skit 😭😭😭
🥇
Hello Genius we'll put Yung Bleu under the next interview
WOW THATS COOL i can listen to that for my whole life bro
First video where Drake is not starting the song
❤️🥀
I wasn't looking for your secret they just came to Me😊
This song is it! 🔥
Why drake never in music videos where he featured😂😂😂
Drake fucked it up
So Drake couldn't show up huh
🔥🔥🔥🔥💪💪🎅🎅
@2:50 Nothing against this song, although when it relates to religion and certain lyrics of this song in question. While being sang, portrayed, or performed in a church or place of worship. To me this is an issue which would be great to address. Even though the overall subject matter of some song lyrics relates to religion and personal spiritual journeys in life, some lyrics might be best not to be spoken in a place of worship I feel.
I fucking love this video #Thebestweddinglovecrash LMAO
This song is toxic as fuck lol
This song goes crazy who wrote this?
Love is fake😂
Imagine a remix with Burna Boy in it!😤😤🐐
Really think the track is better without drake but FIYAAAA🔥🔥

Yung Bleu cool music!
Great song
that boiii singing from his soul but you don't see it in his face G.O.A.T
The fact that nobody ain’t picked up that this is the ‘Lucid Dreams’ Sample is beyond me
I love the song. Just don't like how you made a video without Drake.
In reality your ex is your ex for a reason... Once you back down that road...most of the time you remember why. This was very SELFISH and true love is actually SELFLESS
India🥺
This shit making my heart break worse.

If a dude ever sings to your girl at your wedding, immediate hands need to be distributed.

That toxic relationship where you still love the memories and the person you fell in love with; no longer loving the person they are now but just miss the old times
Banger🌟but Yung bleu gotta chill he can’t have India folk 😭
yung bleu my facvourite moment in the video is 3:43
I’m not down with asking if anybody object at my wedding. I’m liable to 2 piece the priest and keep it moving.
Is it just me, but this beat sounds like JUICE WORLD.
Imagine getting married and a guy comes in singing throughout the whole ceremony and steals your girl on top of it all
Loved drakes part , “but pretty taught me ugly lessons “ 💯
YouTube Artist Reacts to Yung Bleu - Your Mines Still ft Drake [VIDEO] TJR86 #YUNGBLEU #DRAKE #NEW https://youtu.be/RaSBXiycanI

Toxic much 😩😂🤦🏾‍♀️
This song smooth asf
You hard ‼️💪🏼
This is why I'll never simpishly believe in, or trust a female love interest. I'm not even sure if I could genuinely "love" a female, other than my own daughters and female relatives. This is how females will do us, if given the opportunity. Throw us right under the bus. Especially the prettier ones. Smh
This song really give u a felling like if someone broke your hart
She used to be so BEAUTIFUL street life I guess😔😣
Why am I just now getting this recommended to me 5 days later?!?!?
2160p  HD Is Crazyyyy Clean Crisp

Lolll did anyone else noticed when drake said, but pretty taught me ugly lessons, the camera went from a beautiful girl to a not so traditionally "handsome" guy.
Now She will never get married 🤣😂
Omg you don’t sound how you look I like it
“They say time heals. Don’t go build a life without me cause your mines still”  I feel that-

"Pretty face, pretty tempted But pretty taught me ugly lessons Pretty had me giving more than I was getting"   Felt that in my SOUL!
Sometimes women are pressure to marriage... its like I want to do it but I can't because I'm still in love with my pass 😩😩😩 its not right but the heart wants what it want... love this song

Sooo, I’ll take the one you left behind😂
I’ve bin here since 1k followers. Ma boy growing no cap 🔥
Me to my leftovers: you’re mine still
No lie, man's popped in my recommendations. But can't help but imagine bro being an afrobeat artist. He come out west African. Yet how this song is setup, it's like American style vibe that a afrobeat tunes gives. This joint heat though.
This shyt slap cuz 🥶💧🥂
She almost married budget lebron .. that's tough
such a good song, holy voice and melodic.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Oh yes I been looking for this song
The beginning is just intense my first time listening to this guy @yungB voice on flick 🥵🥵 I LOVE IT

this song makes me really happy and really sad at the same time. not many songs can do that, amazing job bleu ❤️👌😊
Sad because my ex blocked me in 2009 then unblocked me 10 years later, said sorry I said sorry for the past then blocked me again, I feel like she’s still bitter and angry not to mention every time I hear this song I think about her am I wrong for feeling this way about her still
Man I miss my ex😩
from the right angle he looks kinda like jacob sartorious
keep grinding if we were to get a future we would go platnuim
nice
Catchy hook, very relatable lyrics. Perfect combo for a hit. Drake has perfected it years ago, which is why when he heard this, he already knew.. Drake should have been there for the video though, or they should have waited until they could get him in the video.
Should never be so relatable dude💀😭😭😭
India made the video 10000x better I love her 😍
Salute to the director of this video its rare that a visual can grasp a simple but cinematic experience for a great song by Bleu !

Sad Truth:  Toxic love is the most exciting love tbh. It hurts but it’s the pain you can’t live without.
Randomly clicked started listening middle of the song oh he sound like drake look at title....(Feat. Drake)
The groom and groomsman ain’t do their job. He should’ve got jumped, walking in the church talking about “let me hit one more time”

💔
So fucking relatable to like fr my guy
Been waiting for tha video Yoooooo
My baby India🥺
Kudos to the director this was actually a very solid video... Drake missed out not being in it.
Folks we need to wake up they're literally slapping it in people's faces now. They don't even care they know we in the end of days, so they don't care at this point, cause the anti Christ otherwise known as the false Messiah is about to reveal himself to the world after they cause destruction on the world and america is broken down. Folks if it was anytime to pray and repent now would be the time. Accept the most high elohim's commandments now, and the gospel of our savior that died for our sins and rose again, now and repent. I'm not looking for a argument, I'm simply telling you that I've woken up out of this world and it's distractions. I'm telling you this year didn't happen for any reason they have something planned for sure. I hope y'all realize that this vaccine the election and their false Messiah who the Jews are now calling for is about to happen, and trust me they got plans for whoever don't take the vaccine and all resisters. Guillotines and other methods go search up the plan they got that been in act since the Obama Care. They just was waiting to do it. Go watch ipet goat and y'all will see they got the world fooled right now with thinking it's gone go back to the way it was. You can't tell with the weather, earthquakes, floods, meteors, threats of big astroids.all types of evil symbols they putting on the shows we watch. Smh go look at netflix programming us and our kids to do certain things, and act certain ways, and the music for you to have a mushed out brain. Don't get me started on the social media stuff. Mean while if you look over seas you can see they're enacting their plan which is bout to be starting with this peace deal, and other stuff. I'm telling you right now it's bout to get tragic we got to stop playing with God and our one true Messiah. Time is short just do your research, people are waking up and getting out of this occult world that God is about to judge. The time is about to come where comfortability will be taken away and you will have to make a decision to choose our creator (yahuah) and his son the one true Messiah (yahusha) or this world and Satan and the anti Christ, flesh or the spirit, Life or death. I truly believe the rapture will happen to so some believers won't half to endure the things coming upon this earth, but just know if after seeing this and you continue to act like you don't care and you don't believe what I'm saying nor believe to follow God and repent or you just to selfish to wanna change. God has a place for these people, the unrepentant of all kinds shall see the lake of fire after all this, and they're judgement shall come quickly, and he will send the unprepared a strong delusion, that they should believe a lie and suffer. America is going down to start this off so if you live in this country like I do you should be utterly prepared now repenting and staying in the word and doing the commandments of our father and believing what his only begotten son has done for the world of the wicked. Please folks wake up. I was like everybody else, walking in the same wy drinking smoking cursing listening to the same type of music partying and worried bout myself, but I've changed my ways and have been studying hours of scripture and getting out of the false religion and the falseness of this world and studying Satans plan with the elite. Folks wake up now ask for forgiveness, and repent now time is most definitely short love y'all💯🙏🏽💟💟💖
Anyone else come here to see drake🐐😡
Drake always goes missing in videos🤦🏾
Gonna break up with my girl so that she get married to someone else.... so I can do this.
Lol
SÓ QUEN É BRASIL 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷 E BRISA NESSE TALENTO, 🔥✌️
The ending when they stop smiling and she side eyes him ... Its crazy cus this is really how people feel. You  might not want your ex to get married to the guy/girl shes with now and a part of you might “want them back"....but you know if yall were actually together again you  wouldnt be happy just like when you were together the first time, all those issues will come back. But we dont think about the problems when were apart from them. I love how you displayed this in the ending showing the reality setting in and im sure a lot of people missed it..the idea of yall being together is a much happier picture than yall actually being together...
No One:  Absolutely No One:  Karens: “Mines” isnt a word 🙂   Yeah stfu
I always wonder how do these people ive never heard of get exspensive ass features???
kepner and avri b like

I'm the beginning of the song it sounds like Lucid Dreams from juice Wolrd
"Pretty taught me ugly lessons." Best line in the whole song.
Finally a video to my fav song / singer
Damn he didn't kill a million niggas in this song and under 25 finally
why is yung bleus part way better thn drakes no disprespect i feel like the ft could have been better and a drake feature is like 1 mil surely
Drake Is Not In This Video Thank Me Later 😒
Where’s drake?
😱😱😱😱😱➡https://youtu.be/gIhWuMStXkw
This song describes any toxic relationship....ur toxic ex will always have a hold on you, even when the man you truly deserve is ready to marry u.
Didn't Wale do this whole run in the church ( A Different World) thing. Not a fan. Only reason why Im not. Because I had an ex that wanted me to breakup her wedding and ask her to be with her. Because she wasn't happy. This was some years back. Im not that bold to breakup somebody's wedding. I just don't have it in me. Im good. But the some was okay. Didn't care for the part where he is talking about ( let me have that p again ) while walking in the middle of the church. I know its a video, but man have some respect. He could have switch the seen back to the car for that part. But its his video. Not mine. Best of luck
I’m drunk asf but Drake went hard on this man 😭 both did 🤙🏼
I can tell the budget was high on this video. Drake should’ve showed up or filmed his part at a different location at least
Hes best song this year
So In Love With This Song 🤗❤‼️
*mine 🤦🏾‍♀️
The black women always lightened 🤣
This song will be played at all baby showers in the ghettos of America 😭😭
The real G.O.A.T of our time! 🐐
Y@ssss
Why drake never show up for the shoots
This song is such a vibe 💯😊
🔥
haha i bought the same beat :')
I don't wanna go without you make me
❤️❤️
Before i watch it let me guess that drake is not gonna be in the video. Be back shortly with the update👍🏿  Yep I'm sadly disappointed.
Love it. Hey Papa Bleu. I see you
Man this the song of the year.. This makes me miss my ex 😞
I didn't even hear drake part maybe im tripping
The beginning sounds like Lucid Dreams
SHE IS SOOOOO BEAUTIFULLLLLLL WHA—
This a music video video not just patron n bitches💥💥
Drake could of been in the video he did get paid for the feature
The video made the song 10x more toxic
India😍
Killing it
Sounds like lucid dreams beat
Down to do better 👑
Where's DRAKE BRO ?
I’m to late she’s got a family now😒
To be honest, drake could've been left off this and it would still be just as good 💯
drake must've owed some favors cause this shit is trash
I'm forever a big fan of you keep being amazing!😻
Who dat gurl?
THIS MY SHITT
Did this beat kinda remind you of juice worlds song lucid dreams
Cool song!
I need somebody to love me like whoever bleu sings about 😂😍
🔥 💙 ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,@ufokdj

🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Real Weston road flows!
Yo this song is fire
The end of music video has the music cut arubtly and a gloom sets in as she realizes what she did. Without the music in the background , the scene looks sad and forlorn.
This the hurt nigga anthem we desire love but go through so much pain to get it.
😩😩😩
Go Check Out👀 j.Bad210 In Bad $anta🎅🎄Out Now On All Platforms ❗From San Antonio Tx💪 https://youtu.be/B5N-bk2B5FM
This song hit soooo hard💯💕... Ong its hard asf!! 💕💕💯
Sum about this song just hit different
That's adultery
Anybody else notice how drake is nowhere at all in the video?? Very weird
this song is how it be in real life. Its always that 1 guy they can never get over. Will cheat on their new guy or willend stuff on a whim. So if u ever in this situation or have been u can relate being bleu or being the groom
The ending reminds me of how I wanted someone back really really bad, and when I got him back I no longer wanted him, and realized why we separated in the first place & actually became okay with not being together ever again. Ending was DOPE!
I can’t decide wich part of the vid my fav cuz it just sums up I was jamming then this song left me in my feelings 💕
India love is so fucking fine! 😍
Dude at 1:34 looks like bald A$AP ROCKY
The judgement look at 3:00 is hilarious, that needs to become a viral gif LOL
Beautifully toxic
Trashhh smh 🤦🏾‍♂️
Groom shoulda opened fire on errybody... jus my opinion
Shit make me feel like I got ex problems even though I don’t
They should introduce the woman stars in the videos
The groom looks like a knock off Gucci Mane🤦🏾‍♂️
🖤
Why do people say “mines” instead of “mine” when they are referring to something that belongs to them?
I love this song ffs
She bahd af
Drake is never in a video anymore 🥺 I couldn’t believe they shot gold roses without him
❤
A remake to A Different World wedding scene would’ve been lit.
I listened to this shit like 100 times today😭😅🔥🔥
Been obsessed w Yung Bleu’s music for awhile now 😭 this shit definitely on repeat 🔥
Toxic!!! lol 😂
This video plus the song priceless on repeat 24/7🥰💋
Imagine buddy walking in yo wedding singing this and taking yo gal
Love love this song 😭🔥
😳😳 https://youtu.be/36-nv-SN3vo
😔💔

India is beautiful. Shit. Where Champagne at!??
So nobody saw ASAP rocky
Don't go building a life without me
I wanna send this to my ex but she hates me 🤣🌚
🔥 fire ass song
this is a fucking masterpiece
What be a female mind stringing a man they don't really love all the way to the alter?
And of course the Groom look like russel wilson😭😭😭
This the hood version of Jidenas BAMBI 🔥🔥🔥
I’m in love with this . Maybe because it’s relatable 💥💯
Drake lacked not being in the video
Fuck this song!!🖕🏿   With "Lucid Dreams" sounding melody
Really got me in tears 😫💜 my boyfriend played this to me and asked me to marry him thank you bleu
Those famous twins slapped lol
Uhm! Where does Drake come in on this song exactly?
Juice sample

Click bait. No Drake here.
Yall i need help wtf is that song on tiktok and memes and shit that its like melodic and chill and theres a gun cocking sound or some shit and then its still chill but with more bass and some dude with reverb is going "give me something ooh uh loooove" or "give me a reason to uuuuhlllv" WTF is that SONG
I love the face expression😂❤️
That's drake versus was spot on bar for bar.
I see he got my wife India in the video 😂😂😂💯
India so fine🥺❤️
Drake gotta start poppin up to these videos
Do a genius version 🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Bleu da truth

This video could have been done so much better if they utilized Drakes Role in the song as the guys new gf and how their relationship has been gettin worse after their engagement

Im so in love with a beautiful soul but she's from overseas and I have to get the money together first I want to marry her 😔 its so difficult 😭 I fear that her family will do me wrong cuz they think Im just playing cuz Im months late now... I dont wanna lose her.. I made a song with her voice on it, still I didnt upload it on youtube yet..  I dont know if its stupid but maybe I mean maybe some of yall can change it by supporting me as in subscribing.. Thank you and wish you all the best I hope that none of yall will have to go through the same  as me 🥺 its so sad 😔 Ghizlan I love you I love you so much I dont wanna lose you  😭 I dont want any other girl than you I hope that the lord will take me If something wrong happens and I cant marry you .. love you 😭❤

Who else got an Juice Wrld vibe‼️🔥🔥
She fa the skrrreets
Damn India
Y’all check out miss
Really a relatable song 😂🥺
Slap
ive had this song stuck in my head for a minute now ....
Drake sound like durk on this one
Is it just me or does this sound like it has a sample of "Shape of Your Heart" by Sting and used by Juice world in Lucid Dreams!
Perfect example of how toxic some of these men be 😩
A fuckin masterpiece
who is the female lead in the video whats her IG
Guitar loop sounds like lucid dreams
Her dress fire asf 🔥🔥🔥
It’s interesting how at the end you notice that they go from smiling to just being uninterested. The idea of how we want to be with someone from our past, but it’s really just that we don’t want them to be with someone else. So when we see that we try our hardest to get them back because we want them, but it’s really just not wanting them to move on with someone else. Because when we do get them back we realize it was just panic and emotions. But not long lasting. Nice twist.
Even without Drizzy showing up, the video still fire as hell. Glad Bleu finally getting the recognition he deserves. Much love and respect from Kansas City 💯
I love his Music & the sound.
Fire 🔥 🔥🔥🔥💯
Ah wished Drake was in the vid.
🔥🔥Throat baby female version facebaby check it out if you love young bleu you’ll love this click the link🔥https://youtu.be/blC9ZvsOKuY
I still miss my ex💔
This TOXIC hunty
My heart broke when I saw Drake wasn’t in the video 😔
I love when came in the church toxic or whatever I played this from Houston to Beaumont on repeat sent it to my ex who lives in Baton Rouge the next day she canceled plans to just see me for weekend she left yesterday and made back to her dude safe maybe Yung bleu is a Toxicologist 💙... I do kno that “She don’t wanna go to sleep she angry” lol
Notice at the end when she is happy but then after a minute her mood changes and she looks at him in a weird way .
3:55 That ending just hit hard, I felt that deeply. 😪 Sometimes the past is best left as just the past.
On repeat in my Playlist

HER 3:46  dam
welp i’m going to enjoy this before tiktok decides to take a shit on this masterpiece
Song is great relatable n toxic  This is dumb, she’s leaving a man ready to love and commit. To run off with a man who clearly is toxic to her and not going to give her things the other man could. Run off with the bad guy n expect him to do good guy shit 🤦🏾‍♀️
I love this song I personally think it would be much better if it was a female feature I feel like a female voice would go perfect with the beat
How can you have a feat and your featuring not in the video
That was tight
This shit is trash
They say time heals😩,,She can’t see her life without me she soo blind still🥺🤍!!!

Like really imagine someone stealing your girl at your own weeding....

Dangerous words to a melodic song.... These facts tho 🔥🎶😎
Is it just me or does the girl in this vid look like Mullato
Jesus died for you was buried and rose again on the third day according to the scriptures   If you confess with your mouth Jesus is lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead you will be saved. Please repent of your sins and accept Jesus Christ as your lord and savior

That blissful moment at the end; like Nada else matters 🎆

Peep the ending though. When the emotional high wore off and they could no longer glamorize their past relationship in each others absence. Reality set in. Crucial aspect!

He def couldn’t afford to have drake in the video 😂
He took her from a man who was willing to make an honest woman outta her, but is he going to at least marry her, change for her, give her all he should have given to her the first tym around????  Such guys come just to ruin things nje😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂after that, it's back to the same old fucking around
my gf dont like me
Where tf is Drake 👀🤔
Jesus  is coming back, how are you honoring him with your life? It is not too late to repent, treat all females with respect in your lyrics too and live right so that you may return with him!  God loves us all equally. You are created to be a creator too! Thanks for being a creator of music.
I feel  bad for the dude who actually proposed and then she just leaves but the song was fire lol
makes me think of my hubby..we been thru the most shit and now 3 years into our marriage we just got our new car and our daughter is gonna have the best christmas she could ask for.. your songs always speak to me.
But is he guna marry u girl?! Lol jk yo I love this song, the video, everything. This dude looks like he's a nice guy in real life... Duno why lol
Probably the only song that didn’t really need a drake verse but he did his thing tho can’t stop playing this shit even tho I can’t relate
Thank you brother
“mines” is not a word but go awffff😩
"GOD is not willing for any to perish but all come to repentance " "For GOD so loved the world that HE gave HIS only begotten SON that whosoever believes in HIM should not perish but have eternal life " JESUS CHRIST is HIS name

I just want to hear what after Auto-Tune
If she wasn’t ready to be married why she tell the guy Yes when he asked her.
vibey
This a boo I listen to it everyday
https://youtu.be/0XheWXlIHGw.
@melanie edwards its a japanese skin lightening lotion. It says in the article the african american hollywood celebrities use it, it changes their skin color a lot from black to light skinned mixed race  but they deny it https://matsuiskinlightening.com/products/bleaching-skin-lightening-orange-peeling-lotion-100-ml-top-selling-product  i guess the reason they deny using this lotion is probably because they want people to think they are naturally light skinned, people should just be honest.
Song yah tuff yf😈🔥
Dope visuals but wtf is drake tho?!
1:00 Now I see why she had all them rings on, she didn't want to marry him.
Pretty having me giving more than I was getting 🥲 I feel tht
2:51 Bleu said IKYFL
Rap music sucks it's nothing like it used to be
0:44 she got 10 rings on ...where is the wedding band going?
I'm listening when i'm walking!
Still think bout her 😞 true story
That might be one of the most relatable drake verses ever
💯❤️😉

😭😭😭😭😭😭😢😢😢😢 this puts you in your feelings
Drake like fuck that video 😂😂
“And you, child, will be called the prophet of the Highest; For you will go before the face of the Lord to prepare His ways, To give knowledge of salvation to His people By the remission of their sins, Through the tender mercy of our God, With which the Dayspring from on high has visited us;"  Luke 1:76-78  You are blessed. You are Loved. You are valuable. You have a purpose. Continue to spread love and truth. Trust God who wants the best for you and wants you to remain faithful during this testing period., don't trust the Media or anyone else that is telling you to panic.  Don't fear what man(media) tells you to fear, fear what God tells you to fear. Continue to perfect a loving relationship with the Lord, with your self and, and with others and it will cast out all fear. "There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear, because fear involves torment. But he who fears has not been made perfect in love."1 John 4:18

Classic mistake how women leave a man who treats them like a queen and wants to take them serious and give them what they want for a no good dude who treated them sh*tty. Lmao this song so toxic but it’s catchy and I like it. It be like that.
I still see your shadows in my room😣
Is that India love ?
Like that episode from A Different World...and trust Drake to help you hate on a nigga's come up with a woman that he still finds sexually impressive.
This is it!!!!!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
No hate but why is drake in this song?
This man bought tears to my 👁👄👁
Love it ❤
Definition of toxic lol
It makes me want to cry and call all my XXXs to tell them I still love them. ☝️😐
Fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith. For the joy set before him he endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. Hebrews 12:2   If anyone acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God lives in them and they in God. 1 John 4:15   In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus. Philippians 2:5   I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one will snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all; no one can snatch them out of my Father’s hand. I and the Father are one. John 10:28-30   Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved. Acts 4:12   But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was on him, and by his wounds we are healed. Isaiah 53:5   This is how God showed his love among us: He sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him. 1 John 4:9   My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you. John 15:12   If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. Romans 10:9   But in your hearts revere Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect. 1 Peter 3:15   Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, since as members of one body you were called to peace. And be thankful. Colossians 3:15
That Drake verse 🔥 🔥 🔥
Mrs. Robinson ??? 🇫🇷
The action brought about by the response of self-preservation, which is natural intelligence, is instantaneous and it is also cultivated unconsciously or consciously. Similarly, we have recorded psychological preservation, the fear of not recording and the knowledge of that gives a central feeling that you must preserve yourself and from that you act.
Tuff 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Drake time to fall off 😩😭😭
I tried to kill myself this year and it was over a man who degraded me betrayed me and took my kid from me ☹️😭
Damm no drake

The video gives me norbit ending vibes
This is the most important post you will ever read.  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good deeds because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake.  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he conquered death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ;  Except a gift can either be accepted or rejected..So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment; don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you surrender your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. And as it is written (Hebrews 9 : 27);  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’ .  All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ.  https://www.amazon.com/dp/1432117742/ref=emc_b_5_mob_i

❤️.
imagine getting your girl back just as she’s getting married
Dear precious one, Jesus Christ loves you with a love that can't be described with mere words. It is an eternal love that will NEVER cease. When you receive Jesus Christ into your life, you are receiving a magnificent, awe-inspiring, monumental gift of love and deep intimacy with the one whom created you and knew you BEFORE the beginning of time.                       Dear Friend, fully receive Yeshua (Jesus Christ) right into your heart right now. Walk boldly along the path of Life, relying on your ever present Companion in Jesus. He will accompany you all the days of your life - and onwards into eternity. Acknowledge that you are a sinner in need of our Savior.                  Confess with your mouth and believe in your heart that Jesus is Lord of your life. Welcome Abba Yahweh (Father God) through Yeshua (Jesus the Christ) into your life. Receive grace by believing in Jesus Christ and what He did on the cross, His death, burial and resurrection for the sins of all human-kind. You will then be justified in salvation and forever blessed with His abundant love by the Holy Spirit!  ❤️❤️❤️                                                                      (John 20 : 19, 21; John 14 : 27; Hebrew 12 : 2; Isaiah 41 : 13)

Hi everyone! I hope y'all are having a blessed day! 😁 If you are reading this, it's not by accident! God wants you to see this! ^^ Hosanna to the Lord! He is SO AMAZING!!!! ❤️😄❤️ There is only ONE God, the TRUE God, he is the maker of heaven and earth. And he made us in his image and likeness, male and female, with dignity, value, worth, and purpose! ❤️ He made us to worship him. But we chose to sin against him, to rebel against him, and to disobey him. So, as a result, we are separated from God and live under the foolish myth that to some degree, we are each our own God, declaring right and wrong, living our own life, by our own rules, and standards. And guess what! That God ♥️LOVINGLY♥️ came into human history as the man ♥️Jesus Christ fully God and fully man!♥️ He was born of a virgin and he lived a life without sin, though he was tempted in every way as we are. And he WENT to the CROSS and there he SUBSTITUTED HIMSELF for sinners. When Jesus went to the cross, he took WILLINGLY upon him the SIN of those who would come to trust him! ♥️ That means me, as a sinner, Jesus WENT to the cross and took upon himself ALL my sin, past, present, and future! 😭❤️ And Jesus Christ God who was a man, DIED IN MY PLACE, FOR MY SINS, PAYING MY DEBT TO GOD, AND PURCHASING MY SALVATION!!!♥️♥️♥️ Jesus' dead body was then laid in the tomb, and for 3 days, he was buried. On the third day, a Sunday, (which is why we worship on that day) Jesus ROSE in VICTORY over satan, sin, death, demons, and hell. And he COMMISSIONED us with the HOLY SPIRIT, to be MISSIONARIES telling this ♥️AMAZINGLY GOOD NEWS♥️ that there's a ♥️God♥️ and PASSIONATELY, LOVINGLY, CONTINUALLY, RELENTLESSLY pursues us and he ASCENDED into heaven. And today, Jesus is ALIVE and WELL and he's seated on a throne, and he is ruling and reigning over ALL nations, ALL cultures, ALL philosophies, ALL races, ALL periods of time. And he is KING OF KINGS and he is LORD OF LORDS and he is RULING and REIGNING over ALL people, commanding EVERYONE EVERYWHERE to REPENT of EVERYTHING and he is COMING AGAIN to JUDGE THE LIVING AND THE DEAD, and those who trust in him, will enjoy ETERNITY and his KINGDOM of heaven FOREVER, and those who do not will SUFFER APART from him in the CONSCIOUS ENTERAL TORMENTS of HELL. That is what we believe, we believe is JESUS!!!♥️♥️♥️♥️🙌♥️♥️♥️♥️ God bless you!!

Salute From a Soldier https://www.amazon.com/Quest-Holy-Magic-Billy-Williams-ebook/dp/B08QRKXXHX/ref=mp_s_a_1_1?dchild=1&qid=1608356915&refinements=p_27%3ABilly+Dee+Williams&s=digital-text&sr=1-1&text=Billy+Dee+Williams
Not me crying to this
Hey Jerold
Hey everyone, I got a new video. Like, share, subscribe and let me know what you think.   https://youtu.be/07JjBk8q5Gg
Because of the increasing rate that prophecy is being fulfilled, this world is quickly coming to a close. The great tribulation is about to begin, the worst time this world will ever know. God the Father wants to have a relationship with His creation. But everyone is born into sin and we need a way for us to be able to live eternally with the Father in heaven. Jesus made that way. Even though He is God, He left heaven and came to earth to be a sacrifice for a lost world. He never sinned. He was abandoned by His friends, was betrayed by Judas and handed over to be crucified. He was beaten so badly that He could not be recognized as a man. Then He willingly suffered an agonizing drawn out death on the cross. He was buried and on the third day God raised Him from the dead. And now He sits at the right hand of the Father and He is coming back any day now to Take home those who belong to Him. Just believe that He died for your sins.  You don't have to repent of sins. People who teach that, are wrong and they are not saved.  You don't have to give up drinking or drugs, etc. Just have faith that Jesus fully paid the price. After you are saved rest in Jesus' sacrifice. God will guide you and help you get rid of bad habits and to do good works according to His will. If you think you should do works, you're saying Jesus' sacrifice was not enough. Faith plus works will NOT save you. Once you believe that Jesus died for your sins, you will receive the Holy Spirit and you are sealed for eternity. Nothing you do or don't do can cause you to lose your salvation. Those who say that you can lose it are not saved. There is nothing we can do! It's all about what Jesus did! God gave us free will but He is a just God.  Rejecting salvation means an agonizing eternity in hell! In the great tribulation, the age of grace will be over and to be saved you must believe on Jesus plus resist taking the mark of the beast. Believe on Jesus now and you will escape having to go through the great tribulation!         I will try to answer if you have any questions.        For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life. John 3:16
Man this shit hits

So i woke up and im like there's only 7 days till christmas but you know when there's presents you just have to ask your parents hey what's in there you will probably get the every day saying it will ruin christmas if we tell you, but i was determined so i asked and asked till they say sure go ahead and the next thing you know the boxes were empty i knew it. I knew that i was just being too greedy and this is my punishment but before a nother thought came to my mind my parents lean closer to me and said christmas isn't about gifts its about spending time together but i knew this was a lie so i ran away with my phone and found somewhere to camp outside and the only way to pass time was to watch pewdiepie.... .. . so that's my back story anyways hows every one.31

Thought I was over my ex till I heard this.. 💔
Drake fucked up for not being the video.
I was expecting a shady move when I invested on a platform by amerifxoptions . I just made my second withdrawal of $15,000 from the invest of $1500 . I’m glad I made that move
By the stripes of the Son of God ye were healed. Repent and turn to God that your sins may be blotted out and times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord. He healed me of every sickness and disease and every infirmity. He bindeth up the wounds of the broken hearted and he healeth every infirmity. For God hath given his people a spirit, not of fear, but of power and love and a sound mind. Abide in him who is faithful and true for life eternal is to know the one true God and Jesus Christ whom he sent. Come out of the churches who profess to know God but deny him in works and he will be a Father unto you. And you shall be his Son or Daughter. Amen.
Toxic asf but i love this song 🤣❤️‼️🔥
I felt this song on so many levels
Yoooo Bleu is the truth!!!

Heard you been tryin to tie the knot, girl tell me you lyin‼️
1 Corinthians 13:4-8  Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth. Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never ends. As for prophecies, they will pass away; as for tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will pass away.  1 John 4:9-11   In this the love of God was made manifest among us, that God sent his only Son into the world, so that we might live through him. In this is love, not that we have loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins. Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.  John 3:16-17   “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him.  2 Chronicles 7:14   If my people who are called by my name humble themselves, and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and heal their land.
Go on and just give him all the awards😍 its pass due .
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping you from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteous. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Yo went and got his girl that’s what I’m talking about   They say time heeeeeeeeal don’t go building no new life because your mines still
"They say time heals... Don't go build no life without me 'cause you're mines still Ohh, and I don't wanna go unless you make me"...  I felt every word😫😫  So relatable🔥💯

This song was written for the guys who like to keep their exes emotionally attached so that they can’t move on. They never plan on changing their ways or actually committing.They just like saving their exes for later.
This whole track is fire 🔥🔥 🔥 #JakeHunter88
His voice tho 😍
Lmao he broke the wedding up but will he fully commit to her tho? Or is he gonna continue doing the same stuff that caused her to leave in the first place?

As I was listening to this I was just thinking about a lot of stuff 🥺
This song help me heal    Legendary status achieved
I love the whole damn album ❤❤❤
But "mines" isn't the correct word for this song title. Mines refer to either a hole or a tunnel dug in the earth. A more appropriate term is: "Mine."  P.S. I am not hating.
She can’t see her life without me she so blind still 👇

https://youtu.be/Q9R.-yXXXwC8 Wisdom Follow Jesus Christ, he rose from the dead! Obey him before its too late. He is the only way to get to the Father John 14:6 And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him; Hebrews 5:9 Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. Acts 2:38 Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord: Hebrews 12:14 He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy. Proverbs 28:13

QUESTION (READ THIS IF YOU WANT): Will you go to Heaven when you die? Have you lied, stolen, used God’s name in vain, or lusted (which Jesus said was adultery, Mt. 5:28)? If so, God sees you as a liar, thief, blasphemer, and adulterer at heart. If you die in your sins, you will end up in a terrible place called Hell. But there's good news. Though we broke God's Law, Jesus paid the fine by dying on the cross: "God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life" (Jn. 3:16). Then Jesus rose from the dead and was seen by hundreds of eyewitnesses. He fulfilled all the prophecies of the promised Savior. Please, today, repent and trust Jesus, and God will forgive you and grant you the gift of eternal life (Eph. 2:8,9). Then, to show your gratitude, read the Bible daily and obey it, join a Christian church, and be baptized. Visit NeedGod.com and LivingWaters.com
Read this if you want, we all fall short of Gods Glory, and broken Gods law(Murder in the heart, lust, etc.) and there must be a punishment for sin, but the good news is that JESUS CHRIST TOOK OUR PLACE, we must repent and turn to Christ and dont trust in your own understanding, Repent and put your trust in Christ...He who endures to the end shall be saved•The gospel⬇️https://youtu.be/4exu-7RDdKE•Watch a poem "THE GREAT I AM"⬇️https://youtu.be/bYTypUb_Jc4

Remember children of Israel that they will do scare tactics just so you can slip up and receive the vaccine. Don't become victims to these employers who are also control to hire at a certain rate and hire a certain amount of ethnics having "blacks" (children of Israel) at the lowest of the polls. They just want you to make that one SLIP and get this vaccine. I pray that they Most High the true and living God, Elohim of the Hebrews prevent his elect from getting this vaccine.

There is only one act that must dissolve the totality of the conditioning. So that the brain has to face this fact, that though it has been shaped in the process of time and now it’s facing a challenge, which says think and act totally differently, which is not of time.

if i'm not mistaken, this music video is an homage to the movie The Graduate - especially the ending where their happy faces change after driving off.
Who thinks beginning was like juice wrld lucid dreams
Could someone explain the ending..they went from smiling to frowning as if they were regretting their decisions for each other

The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand!  Good News- The Gospel  John 3:16 16 For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. 17 For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. 18 Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son.   Mark 1:14-15 14 After John was put in prison, Jesus went into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God. 15 “The time has come,” he said. “The kingdom of God has come near. Repent and believe the good news!”   Acts 4:12 12 Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved."   Acts 2:38-42 38 Peter replied, “Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. 39 The promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off—for all whom the Lord our God will call.”  40 With many other words he warned them; and he pleaded with them, “Save yourselves from this corrupt generation.”   1 Corinthians 15:2-4 2 By this gospel you are saved, if you hold firmly to the word I preached to you. Otherwise, you have believed in vain.  3 For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, 4 that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures,   Acts 13:39 39 Through him everyone who believes is set free from every sin, a justification you were not able to obtain under the law of Moses.   Romans 10:9 9 If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.   1 Thessalonians 4:16-17 16 	For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a cry of command, with the voice of an archangel, and with the sound of the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first. 17 Then we who are alive, who are left, will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we will always be with the Lord   Hebrews 9:27 27 And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:   1Timothy 3-4 3 This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior, 4 who desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.   Ezekiel 18:23 23“Do I have any pleasure in the death of the wicked,” declares the Lord GOD, “rather than that he should turn from his ways and live?     2 Corinthians 5:17-21 17 Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: The old has gone, the new is here! 18 All this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation: 19 that God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ, not counting people’s sins against them. And he has committed to us the message of reconciliation. 20 We are therefore Christ’s ambassadors, as though God were making his appeal through us. We implore you on Christ’s behalf: Be reconciled to God. 21 God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in Him we might become the righteousness of God
I love how he was every where.
Pretty though me ugly lessons!!

Video just need drake in the Church singing his bar...would have been perfect...
why did I click on this.
You can believe in JESUS CHRIST now and get saved while there is still time. GOD loves you, The Bible says ''Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.'' Mark 12:30 One either loves GOD or loves the world, never both, and the result of loving the world+ the things of the world is death, death in sin , no salvation, rejection by GOD. Are you going to finally get it ? or you keep playing and neglecting the precious LOVE and SALVATION GOD offers through His One and Only SON JESUS CHRIST Our LORD and SAVIOR, who died on the cross to redeem our souls. Please repent and accept JESUS CHRIST, get saved https://youtu.be/lbb4xwYj19g

In 2020, the U.S. GDP will drop 3.8% year-on-year, and the total GDP will be 15.4 trillion US dollars. Among them, the Federal Reserve has issued 5 trillion of money! That is to say, the actual GDP of the United States is 10.4 trillion US dollars! It has fallen into a serious economic recession!

For what i received i passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that He was buried, that He was raised on the third day according to the scriptures  1 Corinthians 15 3   PS: "according to the Scriptures" - what the Apostle means is that Lord Jesus fulfilled prophecy's of the Prophets of God in Old Testament. There are like hundreds of Prophecies that Lord Jesus fulfilled, just look it up bruhs and gurls. God is our Father. He is the best of Fathers, the most lovable and merciful of fathers. Read the whole uncensored Bible that is Catholic(The Original) and  pray my friends. Wish you all well🙏amen🙏   Was the Jesus of the Bible who He claimed He was? Was He really God's Son? Was Jesus the Messiah? There are over 300 prophecies  that point directly to the Messiah. Here is an example of just 8 : The time of His birth (see the Daniel 8 & 9 Timeline). He would be born in Bethlehem. (Micah 5:2) He would be born of a virgin. (Isaiah 7:14) He would be betrayed for 30 pieces of silver. (Zechariah 11:12) He would be mocked. (Psalm 22:7,8) He would be crucified. (John 3:14) He would be pierced. (Psalms 22:16) He would die with the wicked, but He would be buried with the rich. (Isaiah 53:9)   Mathematics & Astronomy Professor Peter W. Stoner has made the statement that the chances of just 8 prophecies (like these) coming true by sheer chance is 1 in 10¹⁷(100,000,000,000,000,000). That would be equivalent to covering the whole state of Texas with silver dollars two feet deep and then expecting a blindfolded man to walk across the state and on the very first try find the ONE coin you marked (roughly equivalent to the Province of Ontario being 1.5 feet deep).  And if we were to add only 8 more similar prophecies, for a total of 16, the odds would be 1 x 10²⁸ x 10¹⁷ or 1 in 10⁴⁵ (1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000)  Using the same type of illustration as above, if we were to press this many silver dollars(10⁴⁵) into a ball and place the center of this ball where the center of our Sun is, this silver ball's outer edge would be in approximately the same area as the orbit of Neptune (almost to Pluto.). One man fulfilling all 16 prophecies by sheer chance would be like sending a blind-folded person out to find one specific silver dollar that has been marked and has been mixed up somewhere in this huge ball and actually finding it the first time! (Keep in mind that this is a three-dimensional BALL, not a disk like our Solar System.)   Professor Stoner gives us yet another illustration, but this time, because a silver dollar, and even the atom, would be too large for this one he chose to use just the electron that orbits the nucleus of the atom.  The electron is one of the smallest particles of matter known to man. It is so small that if you lined up 2.5 x 10¹⁵ (2,500,000,000,000,000) single file you would end up with a line that is only 1 inch long. (If we were going to count the electrons in this line one inch long, and counted 250 each minute, and if we counted day and night, it would take us 19,000,000 years to count just the one-inch line of electrons.) Now back to Stoner's illustration. Using only 48 of the prophecies that Jesus fulfilled it was calculated that the chances of one person fulfilling these by sheer chance would be 1 in 10¹⁵⁷To help us understand how huge this number is he suggested taking 10¹⁵⁷ electrons and pressing them into a solid ball. This ball, made entirely of electrons, would pretty much fill, not just our galaxy, but the entire known universe. (At the time Stoner's book was written the universe was known to be at least 6 billion light years in all directions. Stoner's known universe would need to be filled about 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 times.) Once again we would mark just one electron, blindfold a man and send him out to find that one electron. Peter Stoner then states, "To the extent, then, that we know this blindfolded man cannot pick out the marked electron, we know that the Bible is inspired. This is not merely evidence. It is proof of the Bible's inspiration by God--proof so definite that the universe is not large enough to hold the evidence." Professor Stoner then made the comment that, "Any man who rejects Christ as the Son of God is rejecting a fact proved perhaps more absolutely than any other fact in the world."   This is the Catholic Church that has the Holy Sacrament of Holy Communion every Sunday Mass. Sometimes in history some of  the Priests doubted that the Holy Communion waffer is really the The most Holy Flesh of Lord Jesus Christ. That's when miracles happened and the waffer was turned to actual bleeding Flesch-the tissue that of a human heart, specifically the endocardium.Just Google Eucharistic miracle on Wikipedia or any other site.  Science also has proved it. This  male AB blood and Flesch is still fresh to this day and one  of the first miracles of this type happened during the 700s so we are talking about Blood that never even slightly decomposed during almost 1300 years! The male AB blood type has also apparently been found on the  miracolous Shroud of Turin. The male AB blood type is also found on the Sudarium of Oviedo the Linen cloth thought to have been used to cover the head of Jesus immediately after the crucifixion. There are even reports that blood taken from some weeping statues of Mary are AB blood type. . The Holy Apostolic Catholic Church is full of miracles that happen on everyday basis and there are also many other Bible verses that confirm its claim as the true Church. And as always if someone doesn't want to do extensive research he should just ask directly the Head of the Church and that is our beloved Lord Jesus Christ of Nazareth.

Liked for the title stayed for the songs
Come on Drake! Could’ve pulled up Cuzzo...! 🤦‍♂️
Model name?
Me concerned about the man left at the alter 🥺💔
Please consider the message below, as no one is promised tomorrow... THE MILLION-DOLLAR QUESTION: Will you go to Heaven when you die? Have you lied, stolen, used God’s name in vain, or lusted (which Jesus said was adultery, Mt. 5:28)? If so, God sees you as a liar, thief, blasphemer, and adulterer at heart. If you die in your sins, you will end up in a terrible place called Hell. But there's good news. Though we broke God's Law, Jesus paid the fine by dying on the cross: "God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life" (Jn. 3:16). Then Jesus rose from the dead and was seen by hundreds of eyewitnesses. He fulfilled all the prophecies of the promised Savior. Please, today, repent (confess & forsake your sins) and trust Jesus, and God will forgive you, give you a new heart w/ new desires and grant you the gift of eternal life (Eph. 2:8,9). Jesus said "unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of heaven" (Jn 3:3). You do NOT have to get religious b/c Jesus did not preach religion. Jesus said "I am the resurrection & the life" (Jn 11:25). Then, to show your gratitude, read the Bible daily and obey it, join a Christian church, and be baptized.

John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. Romans 6:23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. Amen.. Repent and turn from sin! Follow God's sacred 10 Commandments! Time is running out!

Love this song 💛
Your rapping is worse than your spelling.
Hahaha. Love this and be strong. You never know who you are inspiring.
00:01 sound like Juice WRLD - Lucid Dreams
That was straight fantasy... You come interrupting my wedding singing that shit, we're gonna cut the wedding short and start the funeral...
Lol leave a man that's willing to marry you for someone who didn't even know what they had??? No sir! But great song ♥️
Glitch man in the vide
Getting norbit vibes
Take drake OUT he not even in the video that’s wack!!!
This needs Druski
My favorite artist. His music is deep and so much emotion attached to it. Keep it bro bruh!
W
Am I the only one who thinks it’s very similar to matrimony by wale ???
The emotions right now 😪
Loveeeeee the song, video is also fye 🔥
https://youtu.be/cfBjqR06Q6A 🔥🔥

If anybody is feeling generous this holiday season, please CashApp $JustNino anything helps!!🙏

Something else for you to consider. If you die today will you go to heaven? Have you ever lied, stolen, used God's name as a curse word (O-M-G)? According to God's law, you're guilty, your headed for hell, ignorance will not be an excuse... But wait, God loves you, he made a way out for you, God's son Jesus died paying for your sin.  God so loved the world that he gave his only son that whoever believes in him will not die but have everlasting life. John 3:16   God is warning the world. End Time prophesies are jumping off the pages of the Bible, plagues, violence, scoffers, government control, earthquakes, fires, floods, people will be lovers of themselves, money, lovers of pleasure rather than God, evil will be called good and good called evil, sexual immorality rampant adultery, fornication, abuse... the ultimate in child abuse mommies killing their babies in child sacrifice (abortion), World leaders are prepping for a One-World order, government, religion (please don’t take a number on your forehead or right hand, read Revelation a number means no heaven, and there's only one alternative) The government is also prepping to have you believe that UFO's are real... Soon the antichrist will come and fix everything, everyone will love him, he will deceive many... then the tribulation will start, life on earth will be horrific. Today if you hear God whispering to your heart please respond before it's too late. Say a humble prayer, pour your heart out to God, receive Jesus as your savior, believe God raised Jesus from the dead, and repent of your sins.
135 guys got left at the altar
Everything is perfect. Sweet, simple and beautiful mv. I just don't like the autotune sounding voice.
Not gonna lie it sounds like it was gonna be in Spanish this song slaps 🔥🔥🔥
This song hit different when u single 😭🥺😩mann
Video concept was dope 🔥🔥🔥
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=jiN0qTLA8jc👀💪
My fav song em I gotta sub😌
Cringe
I Absolutely love the concept but ....Bullshit LoL  How she "happy" enough to be in the relationship and accept the marriage proposal but yet when her EX pops up at the damn wedding (disrespectful & Toxic) she leaves with him smdh   If you was HAPPY with the EX then the fiancee would have Never existed 🤷🏾‍♀️
The song and sound is fire.🔥 But the message is trash.🗑 For example Drake saying "Ashamed to tell my friends how much I'd do for you, Cause they know that you would never do the same for me" Yo if you catch yourself thinking that way. They are NOT THE ONE. Save yourself please! You’re worth more believe me.
😫😫😫
Most relatable song ever.
This gives me the old Drake feel. Never would i thought
India was a bad actor her face expressions were off
Idk why I'm laughing the whole time at the video 😂😂 love song though
Is this Lendrick Kamar?
Yang milih allah like yg Mili dajal hirawkan 1:39.........m.
Drake ain’t show up cus he smashed India love before
I have never been more sad to be single in my entire life

Bleu asked me out a few years ago and I curved him because I was dating a clown who didn’t deserve me, my loyalty or my time. At the time Bleu was known but was definitely not as big as he is now. I’m about to go through my phone right tf now and see if I still have his number 😩

The ending of this video is a callback to the ending of the 1967 movie "The Graduate" with Dustin Hoffman and Katharine Ross. Watch the ending of that movie and the ending of this video, and you will see the similarity.

I just want to say to all the fellas that's having an emotional moment just know that relationships come and go but the True love no disrespect... It's only Temporary
beautiful song indeed
Drake's verse is on point straight up.
This song a hit.💙💯💫🔥
This is really my song 😭! & India Love Westbrooks is really a doll 😍😍
JESUS LOVES YOU!!! He loves you so much that He hung on a cross and took upon Himself all the sins you would ever commit, the question now is “Do you love Him”? How do you genuinely show your love to someone? What is the greatest showing of love? The answer is sacrifice and then time. Jesus Christ paid the cost for us, through His sacrifice on the cross that we may live a life of health, deliverance and prosperity. How can you pay Him back? You can pay Him back through spending time with Him, thanking Him for the privilege of seeing another day, and by reading His word “The Bible”. He offers you the free gift of eternal through having a relationship with Him, and partaking in this relationship immensely benefits you . He protects, guides, provides, heals, delivers, prospers, blesses you, and so much more. A true, authentic relationship involves communication on both sides. Jesus Christ is often taken for granted, many don’t give Him the slightest of acknowledgement, regardless He is still merciful and loving. Seek Him, acknowledge you’re lost without Him and destined for destruction, believe in your heart wholeheartedly what He did for you on that cross and His resurrection. Confess with your mouth that He is Lord, and you’ve taken your first steps on that straight and narrow path to eternity in heaven with Him. And in this process your life will never remain the same, He will give you the Holy Spirit and grace, which will transform you and enable you to overcome sin, temptations and addiction and live a life that shows your love for Him. Slip ups happen, no one is perfect, but through asking for forgiveness and  by His grace it will occur less and less. And you will enjoy pleasing Him and living a righteous life. You have everything to gain in Jesus Christ. Have a blessed day!!
PALOO
Drake should of show for the video
Too cute 😍
#mood
GREAT VIDEO

Why is it when Drake hops on an all black video about black love it get’s heavily overlooked? Or even when he hops on someone’s song like Yung Bleu for instance? Obviously people are stuck in a time warp. Yeah this world is 💀!!!

Sick song but drake should’ve been on the video
Vision  in her eyes  tell a whole story, stranger  to her heart but not to the  painful glory/was  life lessons  we both  stressing ,never guessing/  always  wanted  first place  but  when you come in second  still check my cell phone for  the last  voice and text message,  they say time heals  but remember who team she on , how can doing the right thing feel so wrong  how come these short  days feel so long/have he ever swam  to the deepest part in your sea,  just to see,   that maybe  a bright future  on a cloudy  beach wouldn't be something I couldn't reach but the farther  I go she get angry  reaching out for me  looking for air but im drowning wake up she still laying next to me  baby dont wanna go to sleep  she angry  lately I realize the man he is aint me......
INDIA is so beautiful 😍

This just proves whoever you in a complicated relationship with or if y’all broke up  try to work that out don’t be with the next person if you have no intentions on staying with them or feel that same love you had for your ex, be with the one who you never stop thinking about & never stop loving ‼️

🙏🏿💯To whomever is reading this, I want to remind you that God loves you and he has a wonderful plan for your life! 😁  God forbid If you died suddenly this very moment, where do you think you would spend eternity??... If you are not sure, God wants to let you know that he loves you very much and that this is REAL LOVE — not that you loved God, but that he loved you FIRST by sending his Son Jesus to die for you to take away all of your sins that you would not perish but have everlasting LIFE!   Gods love for you cannot be measured, it has no boundaries and will look past all your faults. God saved me and set me free from a lifestyle of sin and addiction back a few years ago and my life has never been the same since. God can do the same for you if you allow him. You have a choice, but just know that YOU ARE GODS CHOICE. And though the world may change, his love for you will NEVER CHANGE! God wants a RELATIONSHIP with you! Its not too late! He loves you!  The bible says in Romans 6:23 that the  wages of Sin is DEATH! But the free gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord and Saviour!! Romans 10:9 & 13 says that WHO EVER CALLS ON THE NAME OF JESUS AND BELIEVES IN THEIR HEART AND CONFESSES WITH THEIR MOUTH THAT HE IS LORD SHALL BE SAVED!!  Im going to say a prayer for you! Lord bless my friend and their family with a long and healthy life. Lord I pray you make yourself real to them like you did for me in Jesus name. Friend, If you would like to receive Jesus in your heart or rededicate your life to him, then right where you are say this with me with your heart and lips outloud...  Dear Lord Jesus, come into my heart, forgive me of all my sins, wash me and cleanse me, set me free. I believe that Jesus died for me and that he is coming back again for me. Fill me with your Holy Spirit. Jesus make yourself real to me. I accept you today as my Lord and Saviour. I'm born again, all my sins are forgiven, I'm on my way to heaven because Jesus is in my heart!  Friend if you've said that prayer, I pray that from this day forward your life will never be the same. I tell you today that all your sins are forgiven, and always remeber dont run from God but run to him because God Loves You and has a plan for your life!  If you prayed with me, plz type amen! https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=900241527115892&id=100013901589755  God bless!😁     Don't believe in God??  Proof in the links!...👇  From crackhouse/drug dealer in Wash DC to Pastor! Listen to this powerful salvation testimony!... https://youtu.be/XjTvi_wjZ9U People being filled with the Power of Gods Spirit https://youtu.be/GWqbf7Qv7Kg https://youtu.be/MKWzHeDNpqI Healing & Miracles https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLDcOBdOcvB_5PWtPqeFqI6JSLCih9EH6  Life After Death https://youtu.be/JYuY7Cm4KuQ https://youtu.be/GMAKSByShGU
