POV: my grade level going down since I shot an excellent
I got the exact same jersey
🖤
That roty hint gave away the player pretty much lol
I love when Jeff kicks the ball
It’s hard when you get fouled  -Jesser 2022
Mitch is playing on rookie
🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀⛹🏼🤼
Can I join 2hype
you should use real player p
You don’t know Eugene
Use real player next time
Im from slovenia
oh nice im from serbia too
Jeff thought it was Russell Westbrook but the nba player made all five 3’s
Rip Bill Russel
You have to do more of these videos there soo good
That wasn’t behind the hoop
You should put on real player% to make it fair/ more realistic
Bro Jesse cheated
Fax
On attempt 11the pic was eleven in stranger things
They didn't take the logo shot in the cone challenge, just skipped to the half-court
None of them won on the shooting code challenge Luca made the logo shot
luka did not get the shot behind the back bord
999,992 veiw
Bruh that wasn’t even the game winner, also does Mitchell know how to do a floater in 2k?
Put on real player percentage so it’s more accurate
Micheal cheat he didn't do the shot properly and he gave jeff two hints
he didn't even shoot it from behind the backboard
Bruh. Me watching this in a luka jersey
Deven booker is the perfect cover athlete
How much basketballs do u lose while doing videos🤔
Me at home: sad because I can’t play basketball outside because I fractured my arm:(
we gonna talk about the behind the backboard shot? maybe the part when HE WASNT BEHIND THE BACKBOARD
wait but jeff did not do the deep three
Jeff should've Knew it from the points rebounds and assist
It’s a Luca in the NBA  👌👌👌
Jese win dikas jef meid 4 sots an loka mejd 5 sots
What’s funny about the last to miss free throw is that at the end of their turn they did the same thing that luka did after the other team made a basket is kick the ball into the crowd
8:11 the last shot was not behind the hoop tho
The game winner wasn’t right but its pretty much impossible in 2k so its fine
Bro it Turned how long was y’all out there🤣
That’s not a pull up three luka was slipping.
bruh at 8:21 moochie wasnt even behind the backboard
Did Jesser think he went faster than giannis
Who owons the house
1:27, aint no damn way he said twelve point sixty bro
Loving the series keep it going
Lyly my IyiLyllbylbllllulYlllLluiyLlK  he
Can U do more of these
Mello
Luka
Liar
Luca
I knew it was Luka bet the last one 100% would have given in it away because he is European.
Luka maid logo but Jeff didn’t do it
No one going to talk about how far they shot then how far luka doncic threw it
Lukas shot wasn’t no behind the hoop
Bro, twelve comments is crazyyyy

Huh
I was really thinking Russell Westbrook
Wait what is the practice mode called in 2k
Bro Jeff said Russell Westbrook is 10th in triple doubles
Bro the sidelines run isn’t even fair luka was dribbling and it’s on a nba court
.
I love moochie bro im homiesexual
Jordan
I love busket ball
Can you shout me out?
He gave it away when he did the game winner lol
Your dog water
Legal....
hahaahahaha
Luka didn't make the half court shot
Very good skill you have, Just keep it up, Lot's of love from India.
4:51 he thinks giannis has a 45% fg%?
8:21 isn't behind
How did it take that long to get it🤦😂
i wouldve guessed at the 10th triple double
The one where they made the behind the hoop was not actually behind it
luka donchick
I feel disresceted as a Ser honestly, to not know where the mvp is from
Y u so ogly
You’re kidding…jesser thinking giannas only averaged 8 boards🤦🏻‍♂️
say woa in chat pls
I wouldn’t wear it tbh
hey Moochie, I feel you should do real player % so it can be more accurate because i feel that some of the hints are based more of your talent of the game
Whoever’s reading this, i pray that whatever your going through gets better and whatever your struggling with or worrying about is going to be fine and that everyone has a fantastic day! Amen 💫
The last time it wasn’t my behind the hoop
Dude that three point contest of how many he made was already a hint lol.
You cheated in behind the basket shot
Jesser is brick
Good
I was only three minutes in and thought it was Luka dovish
Um did they even guess for jersey ?
Can you guys make do who can make the best nba player.     Pls
Fantastic
That game winner wasn't even accurate!!!
moochie: says to shoot from behind the backboard also moochie: shoots it from the side
stats are way off
bangers
Put on real player percentage so u don’t green and that
Wish that I could meet you
Michael Jordan 😍
Moochie TRENDING? Big W 💯
I love this series! Keep it up
Love your God so that you may enter Paradise...
He didn’t even shoot behind the backboard
Luka shot a logo three barely and mooching made them do 2/3 court
New site - shirtafied
I Comment Everywhere.
your videos are so good
20 trending yessir
This man Moochie is just cheating at this point. He didn’t even do any of the shots correctly
I wish I could be in one of your videos
My man almost hit and broke the window 😂😂
113th
#18 on trending on youtube lets go moochie
27-8-8 and Jesse thought Giannis? "Slovenia is cold in the winter" Jesse thinks its Jokic... BRUH
WHOEVER SEE THIS COMMENT IM ENCOURAGING YOU TO GET RIGHT WITH GOD BEFORE ITS TOO LATE AND REPENT OF YOUR SINS.
Moochie how do you create the 82 and 0 without drafting and how do you get the players you want without the other team taking them
Make another one, but use a nobody
When he said rookie of the year I thought it was dame dolla cause I did not know that the player u are using was the answer
😯  SHAQ? 😮
Yo Mitchell that was the sideline not the baseline and no one does sprints from the sideline 😂😭💀
That kick from Jeff was way more impressive than everything else LOL
Jesser Jumpshot Chaged
Ddd
They didn't realize that luka kicks the ball to
damn, jesser is lookin jacked right now.
How did Jeff not get it
Jeff is a athlete!!
E
E
Moochie is underrated 100%!
please do more of theys vids i really enjoy them
Jeff shouldn't have gotten the hint he made it from the logo and Jeff didn't!
Vid was a banger keep up the good work moochie
When is PatrickMahoochie coming back
Moochie always makes bangers
Jeff is so lost, Westbrook has the most triple doubles of all time and Jeff apparently thought he was the 10th, so smooth brained
I love these 2k vids please keep them coming
God loves you and I do too and he sent his son  Jesus to die on the cross for our sin.Give your life to Jesus before it’s to late. Jesus he is the way,the truth  the light .If you want to know how reply with how!!!!
How did Jesse get hints and think Giannis at any point? And how did Jeff think Westbrook after the triple double hint??
gg
Yo Mitchell those transitions from the court back to 2k are way too 🔥🔥
Yo big fan of 2hype i saw you guys on a faze rug vid and i checked out all your channels keep up the grind
Jeese thought it was Giannis😂
YESSS ITS BACK
Mitchell is the most underrated 2hype member of all time
Lets all appreciate the amount of effort this man puts in his videos, amazing. Keep grinding bro, I love the videos
They must not watch basketball
Jesser got the biggest hint but still would've guessed wrong 😭 shout out Jeff
The videos are tuff, but sometimes seem lazy. Luke took a 2 pointer on the game winner while you had Jesse and Jeff shoot threes. He also never made the behind the hoop shoot
To nice
To dope
Dope
I love your videos moochie
To cool
Nice
Cool
Joker
Clutch
put it on real player percentages
The fact that luka is 10th all time in triple doubles at 23 years old is insane
#Fuck2Hype
Notifications on and subscribed I love u guys RCL
It is so funny when Moochie gives Jeff 2 hints but Jeff says he needs one more
When Jeff thought Westbrook is 10th in all time triple doubles
unpopular opinion: moochie is best two 2hype member
Keep grinding your videos are so good
E
