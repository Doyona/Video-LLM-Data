You may remember he stuck a bullet against Man City when he was playing for Crystal Palace, but this could be even better than that!
dang
This was my first game back after lockdown what a game 🔵
How has he scored that screamer
Take me back
1:34 2:04
Well done everton
Here after we turned it round against Arsenal
Andros Townsend form 'has shot out  up ,with form like this . Surely , if he continues like this Gareth Southgate would consider him
He has done it at manchester and now Liverppol
2:08
1:33 Literal Goal of The Month
Awarded goal of the month
Demari gray , happy for this lad
That roar when the 3rd went in. Made up for the new lads Townsend and Gray.
1:38
1:35
Keita doing a Cantona/Henry style celebration!❤️
Rafa the best
What a pass from Doucoure!
Townsend is a good signing always liked the player and benetiz has good knowledge about out of favour players at other clubs , I can't describe how good a manager benetiz is so underrated throughout his career to the  point of disrespectful at Chelsea
UTFT 💪💙
Townsend only scores worldies
Everton got so lucky getting Rafa Benitez - some of them still have no idea
Weld one Townsend also hope Everton win the season
Hello every body  I'll be really happy if you see our movie 💜🙏🖤
Some people were cheering before it hit the net!
When doucs picks the ball up and you just hear ‘go on’ then the street end scream ‘there’ and the roar when he’s one on one before bagging it😩
Are Everton fans complaining about RAFA being manager now ???
Crowd celebrating before ball hits the net  for townsend
Make The Most Out Of This Win Everton F.C. Fans As For Me It's A Safe Bet That Your Neighbours Liverpool F.C. Will Finish Above You This Season!!!
But do you remember hating the fact rafa was coming then Townsend then gray......... Then rodon....... You didn't see this coming tho did ya lol congrats to Everton looking good.........
For me its the Doucore assist!
Can't stand burnley well done everton
When is the merseyside derby? I am already looking to it as neutral fan (actually I'm a chelsea fan, so would like Everton to win 😏😜). There'll be many talking points on that game,  last years' Everton away win after years, the injuries, the Benitz and of course the derby itself.
There has been some amazing goals this month what a start to a season the prem is on fire atm so much talent here its great to see
I guess you could say it was an absolute townsend
what a goal great strike
To send amazing goal
1 - 0 down with most of the game to play is an ' epic comeback '...really ?.
So. Much. Quality.  From a Leeds fan.
Such an underatted player Townsend is great signing for Everton
Goal of the month goes to andros townsend.🤣🤣🤣
Playing against Burnley is like when the school bully demands to join in on your lunchtime kickaround at school. Absolutely rubbish at football, and starts stamping on people when he doesn't get his own way.
What a goal by Townsend.
Townsend only scores screamers
Omg it seems like decades ago that Townshend was an England player.
Glad to see Townsend in fine form and doing his thing again with Everton, We miss you here at Palace 🔵🔴
Townsend is SO underrated
Ha Way Everton, get in!
Goodison rocking 10pts from 4 games 3 cracking goals,go on the toffees
love to have the fans back, it makes football so much better!
Goal of the season contender already wow 🔥
I can not get over this comeback we got. Had to rewatch it
Best player of all time tbh
he couldnt do that for palace
Townsend's got his yearly screamer, time for him to do nothing for the rest of the season.
I've never seen Townsend as "over". He doesn't score that often, but that's not his game; he creates and passes fast. The fact that he's still in the premier league (and has been for almost a decade now) is an accomplishment.
What a game!
Stunning from Townsend. Doucoure's pass to Gray was also beautiful.
Take it that Everton fans have got over Rafa's previous employment, Everton look good, greetings from a gooner
If Burnley keep this up they might get less points than arsenal and Norwich this season
Safe to say Tarkowski is a Thiago fan 😂
It’s so good to have the crowds back. Really made this game 🙌
COME ON EVERTON
Epic comeback from 1-0? It's literally the lowest comeback you can attain..
Peach of goal
Townsend and Screamers go hand in hand!!!
Bruno scoring bangers  Townsend: Hold my beer
What a screamer striker by Townsend 👏👏👏
That ball from Doucoure!
Another dejected Toon fan here who cannot believe that Townsend, who once played for us, and Gray who is a great young talent have been snapped up by Everton. Just shows you that Cabbage heed Bruce has no clout at attracting decent players to our club, never mind identifying them in the first place. Newcastle are doomed unless they get rid of Bruce as they cannot get lucky three seasons in a row.
Gray showing a what a goal player he is. Now is time for him to continue
Townsend with the bangers again
Townsend is so underrated. Always been quality and always scores screamers
Is it me or do Everton always start the season so strong. Guys what happens you could get top 4 if you were consistent
that goal was disgusting.
He only scores one of these every two seasons tho. Wish him all the best from a palace fan
Great long range goals by Bruno and Andros this weekend. Fantastic.
Townsend on a free and Gray for £1.7m great business
2 great transactions their
How is Andre Gomez still playing lol
thats what townsend does
Townsend ain’t playing no games
I wonder if Everton bought townsend for the decent goals he does 😅
Benitez proving what a great manager he is by getting the best out of players who were always talented but maybe not believing it. As a Watford supporter also very happy to see Doucoure do well at Everton. Good luck to them for the season.
Everton are looking really good this season! Andros Townsend is one of the most honest players around but he has real quality and if Damari Gray can become a more consistent, hard working player, then he has all of the physical attributes to be a dangerous striker. Benitez has done a decent early job here. Burnley, on the other hand, are looking like a troupe of hammer throwers and could be found out this season.
Honestly how many screamers has Townsend scored!!
Glad to see everton doing well rafa really has got them playing alot better than their previous managers in the last few years good luck for the season from a Arsenal fan here
Well done
Must be satisfying as a manager to see your team equaliser match the oppositions goal.
Grays signing was a masterstroke, think it was around 2.5 million.
Gray, born a blue, always a blue   Glad to see him back on English soil playing well KRO 🔵⚪️
doucouré was incredible again last night
Sigurdsson 45 mill..iwobi..35 mill...Townshend AND Gray a million quid,says it all really
Switched this off at halftime 🤦🏿‍♂️
Townsend scores a screamer against you.... i know that feeling
1:38 The reason you clicked on this video ...
Pope's first save and the goal pickford conceded is a testament to how much better Pope would be for England.
the guy that scored the first goal looks like a daniel wass + dani olmo combo
I’ve always liked towndends always played well when he was playing for England,keep it up he could be in contention to be in England squad
Imagine the feeling of scoring a goal at home, must be like entering heaven
There we go back to townsend only scoring screamers!!!
Rafa got Gray playing like Mbappe
Hope Burnley get relegated but they wont. They are so boring
I expect this sort of thing from Townsend nowadays, he has scored some beautiful goals in the past few seasons but this one is the pick of the bunch.
Every goal Burnley score is setup by a foul. 'Let the game flow'
Hope Southgate is looking at gray and Townsend
Great to see Demarai Gray start to reach his obvious potential, he was a 10 year old when he joined Birmingham City youth and came through their ranks to the first team. I thought Leicester got a bargain at £3.7 million but never shined in the higher quality of the PL. I'm pleased the Birmingham born Gray has now found some form and has a manager who believes in him, if he gets a run in the first team I'm sure he will deliver for Everton and prove to be an absolute bargain at £1.5 million...
I like it when Andros is on Talksport as he comes a cross as a decent man. The shot saved by Pope would have been a better goal than the first !!!
It was alright
Townsend only scores bangers
Leverkusen should’ve used Gray while they had the chance
Goal of the season?
Pope should be saving that
Some cracking goals from Everton plus its nice to see theyve weighted the net frames down!
Townsend such an underrated player, Gray and Townsend for a couple million for both is great business by Rafa🧐
That’s goal of the season nothing will beat that
Why wasn’t Townsend doing that at palace
Palace fan here; I thought us letting Andros go, especially on a Free, was our only bit of 'bad' business this Summer. Seems I was right! Doesn't score many, but they're generally absolute 🍑's. He'll serve ya's well, Toffees fans!
No ones talking about that pass from Doucoure
If they carry on like this....they could end up 9th!!!
Townsend only knows how to score worldies, phenomenal goal
As a Palace fan it's good to see Townsend reinvigorated...he had gone a bit stale and off the boil with us, probably due to Roys defence based set up. He looks like he (and Everton) may have a good season!
Everton are doing very well this season, as I predicted, with Rafa who’s a top class manager. They should finish 6th
We all laughed at the signings of Townsend and Gray but well done to them for proving us all wrong so far👏🏼I knew they was decent but didn’t think Everton worthy especially 1st team football at Everton
I swear Andros Townsend scores a similar screamer like this once a season
Annual screamer for Townsend. That’ll be him for the season now
Doucoré Michael Keane and Townsend 👌👍
Haven’t seen Townsend score like that since he met his mrs
Shocking from Burnley defence
Demarai Gray was an absolutely steal for £1.7 million! 3 goals in 3 games.
Townsend did that against Sunderland too back in March 2013. Top player..
How did Gommes miss from there? Even my dog would have scored that!
I predict Everton will do good things this season.
What an assist for the 3rd goal. Wowwwwww
Townsend was supposed to be Bale's replacement at Spurs.
Always rated Townsend unfortunate to end up at a team like Palace for so long. Nice to see him at a level he belongs and flourishing
Townsend only scores highlight reel goals
Were Everton fans not slating townsend a few weeks ago?🤦‍♂️
Townsend goal of the season what a goal
Everyone laughed at the demari gray signing but he’s proved everyone wrong
Can we just say what a pass from doucoure
The anti-Rafa brigade are quiet
NUFC Fan but love Rafa, Townsend and Grey are amazing pickups, give him time to clear out the squad more theyll do well
Is the manager of Everton  A former Spanish overweight waiter ???
Great second half from Everton and well done to Benitez as well for changing the formation. Could of been 4 or 5 goals within 10 mins for Everton. This is why the English premier league is the best in the world.
Townsend only scores bangers. 🔥🔥
Tottenham shouldn't have sold Townsend, Spurs academy boy.
Townsend playing great football again
Artetaout
I thought Gray and Townsend would just be squad players. But they really are doing the business. If they retain this sort of form across the season it will be interesting to see  how high Everton can finish.
What the hell happened to Townsend jeez.
Who is this Rafa Benitez fella? 🤪
I remember seeing Townsend as a teenager you thought this was a potential World Class player...
James Tavernier goal for rangers at the weekend was better than this. Good strike all the same.
The local Derby gunna be good this year
World Class performance from Townsend there !
Townsend & Gray, absolute quality Rafa is getting out of these
1-0 nil down and sky call it an epic comeback ....
LOL at everyone getting on the Gray bandwagon. Just wait, most players start well at a new club, he will soon show his true, useless colours. Good luck to him though X-D
Burnley going down ✌️
Gray was the bargain of the transfer window
He is sooooo clever Townsend as before he strikes the ball he is looking to his left and then slams the smoke straight into the top corner 👌
Liverpool will sign Haaland next year
Epic comeback... they were 1-0 down and dominating the game come off it Sky
Sorry to say it about a PROPER old skool Football Club but Burnley are FINALLY going down this year with Norwich and A.N.Other. They do little for The Premiership overall..
Mental what Benitez can do with a half decent squad and a bit of backing from a chairman.
Townsend must have 1 of the sweetest left foots in prem. More or less Every goal is a banger
Ben Mee has only scored because he’s alive 😂😂😂
Have to give massive credit to Rafa, lots of doubters when he bought in Townsend and grey but he knew exactly what he was doing. A man that lives and breathes football
Townsend and Gray for 1.7m is an absolute steal. Everton strengthened without spending anything substantial
I don't think it's a "EPIC" comeback from 1-0 down 🙄... Get a grip.
A t goal was a bit 🤒 tho!🤚
Townsend the boy doesn't do tap ins.
Why isn't Townsend in the England squad anymore? 🤔  He's a brilliant winger
Why is it an epic comeback though? It was 1 nil! Hardly epic is it?
I put townsend in my fpl and all my friends laughed at me. Noe they're super annoyed 😂
I'm mad happy for Gray I hate when players that you know are really really talented don't get to show it properly like Ben Arfa remember him running through the whole team and tucking it away nicely but due to injury and whatever else never settled he could have been mentioned with Ronaldo if life just went different in terms of raw natural talent probably had a bit more skill tbh hope gray stays injury free he has more in this locker got a banger like andros fast like bolt the foxes had a young superstar
Gray needs a England call up again
Benitez proving to be a good thing for Everton brought some good players in
Everton playing but not play the best teams yet
Early days but it shows to improve you don’t have to spend loads, it’s getting the balance right. I’ve said for years Everton have lacked pace, we have just had to many slow players. Benitez did great getting these 2 in PL experience for next to nothing in footballing terms.
Benitez
Rafa can get a tune out of Andre Gomes this season. I can see it coming, the guy is such a good footballer, he just lacks self belief.
Screamer!!
He loves a screamer don’t he? 🔥
👏👏👏👏
What a banger from Townsend!! Could Gray be the bargain of the season? I wonder if those who doubted Rafa have changed their tune yet? Early days i know but give him a chance, I loved him when he was at Liverpool, Just as long as he doesn't get Everton above Liverpool in the premier! Lol
Benitez is a great manager he will Prove all the doubters wrong
Almost as good as brunos goal eh. That keane what a great player for Everton.
Why can townsend only score bangers
Good start blues
Burnley had the the ref on their side
this was a very good match
Andres Townsend is still a talented player
1000th comment 😂😂😂
Burnley are going down
Yeah Arsenal Burnley are winning next week
If the Premier League was over 6 Games a season Everton would win it every year
Townsend always played well for England ..wonder if he can earn another cap for England under Southgate?
Is it just me or does Townsend appear for one game and score a screamer and disappear for the rest of the season
This match was actually fun to watch as a neutral fan and gray is such a bargain
Since when was Doucoure a Belgian Man City player
what fabulous goals from Townsend & Gray, Dacoure with the pass of the season so far!
Still can’t get my head around how Burnley managed to sign cornet 🤯
Great second half of footy n townsend what a goal that was
Andros Townsend is just a Gareth bale that didn’t go Real Madrid.
“Reward for being alive” - are Everton’s defenders Zombies?
Hard to watch as a Newcastle supporter
Townsend looking like prime Robben
THE FPL POINTS
Townsend will soon go missing as the season progresses
Townsend having a new lease of life
Andros doesn’t score crap goals! 😲
For as long as I can remember townsend scores a worldy at least once a season
2:48 omg that voice crack  just KeEpS
This season has just felt epic so far, long may it continue
Townsend should be in the world. Up squad as a back up striker for Kane instead of DCL
Honeymoon period continues ...
Townsend only scores bangers 🚀
Good game weldone boys ...
Bruno goal vs Newcastle or Townsend goal vs Burnley  VOTE:
That wonder strike is what I love football great goal mate
Every season he just needs to score a banger
The Three things guaranteed in life:  Taxes Death Townsend scoring a screamer every few years
Classic Townsend gol
Everton doing well so far 👍
Class
The 15-20 mins Everton had in the 2nd half they were unreal
Dammm what a goal
As a palace fan I love to see Townsend scoring again. He loves a special goal vs Burnley 🦅
Townsend only scores screamers
Anyone else always known how good Andros Townsend is?  Wheres he even been since Crystal Palace
The fans r so special
epic comeback? they were only 1 down, it's only epic if you are at least 3 down, and it was only Burnley.
He doesn’t score often but when he does it’s a banger. He scored one like this at his old club
Townsend only scores bangers
Congrats Andros wonderful strike 🔥
Townsend scores one screamer per season and then disappears until next year
No stopping that Townsend goal 🔥
Commentator's voice goes so high pitched when Everton score.
Its unbelievable what benitez has gotten out of townsend and gray already! But i do think he should rest richarlison for a few games cause he played the whole epl season, the cups, the copa america, the olympics so he’s tired and deserves a rest, that’s probably why he hasn’t scored
i think townsend can only score bangers🤣🤣
demarai gray is either being used for fifa 22 starter team or career mode if he is in this mood
What a bargain gray has turned out to be , if he keeps this up ,signing of the season
That through ball to Gray tho...
Wood got no head                 er
People mocked Everton for a "poor transfer window" gray and townsend having been quality so far this season
And just to think the Everton fans were moaning about bringing in Benitez, Townsend and Grey ..
Jesus Loves You!
So far Demari Gray is having an excellent season.
Should never of let him go.....# CPFC
Sad to say but these are the kind of shots on goal are what Calvert Lewin should be making. Great night of second half "come back" football. The first goal inspired the resurgence. A quality cross and great header. The next two goals were awesome. Hope the subs are looking at what is needed on the pitch.
Great goal by Townsend.  Also want o say what a ball in by McNeil right at the start! If that was kdb, taa, kane, etc People would go mental!
Townsend is such an underrated player.  I'm pretty sure near enough every season he's played in the prem he has scored a wonder goal madness.
What a goal from Townsend Everton impressed me a lot played world class
Salah grey,doucoure is the real pogba
I’m a massive toon fan, and I actually feel happiness for the Everton fans and club, Rafa is a top quality manager.
Burnley not a team, just bumper car drivers!
Superb from everton
Simon Jordan eat your words
Once every now n then Townsend pops up  & scores an absolute worldie, take a bow son, take a bow!
I love premier league football for sure the best league in the world so much pace and quality
That pass from Doucoure 🤌🏿 ✨
Let's have some appreciation for that pass from Doucoure for the 3rd goal. Not an easy pass that.
Great goal by Townshend,Gomez would be there till Xmas and still not score.
Rafa is a true blue now
Strike from distance when we play Burnley Arsenal. In fact, have a go v the lot.
Only man that can beat Everton is Laca and aubamabloodclotyang
Let's be honest, even though we don't mention Townsend among the best players in the PL. He is a talented player, who's scored his fair share of stunners. This goal was incredible, but let's not act like Townsend hadn't done this before.
He won't get a mentioned on this but docoure was motm. 2 assists and was just boss.
townsend only score bangers
Townsend seems to be good buisness and Gray,  all we need is to get a right back and we should be ok. Good start Everton,  but l had a feeling the players would respond to rafa.  And they are settling down ok.  We have to back rafa now and turn this great club into a winning mentality with these players.
Guess townsend broke his 1 goal a season curse
Towsend been underrated
That was a bloody great match!
decoure disalloewd goal too
Who needs Messi/Mbappe when we’ve got Gray/Townsend?!!
These guys proving you dont need a man city budget to make good business
Can we just talk about that assist by Doucouré for the 3rd goal🤯
Townsend always delivers some outstanding stuff. He's full of quality when he's fit
he didn't even look at the goal..
So much doubt when gray signed for Everton, doubt him now!
Pickford low key went for an mma style flying knee at 0:20 😂😂
He always scores a screamer every season such a underrated baller
Rafa is still a top manager
Crowd sounding so good here
Nobody in the the comments is talking about Doucoure, this guy has been consistent for Everton in the last seasons. He is really s good player
Demarai Gray is such a talent. As a Leicester fan, I seriously hope he succeeds at Everton. Much love and praise for him!
Townsend back to his best that goal....like one of mine that
A contender for Goal of the Month or even Goal of the Season . What's  brilliant about it , is that  has a quick look up and then takes his eye away and looks to his left  as if he's  checking the movement to his left  weighing up options to pass to someone else before striking it.
Townsend has a bit of a Walcott vibe about him. Could have been so much better and occasionally we get true glimpses of his ability.
Doucoure is good man, he'd start at united for sure. Top top player we could use him
Epic comeback? More like a stroll in the park.
Townsend has a habit of pulling goals from his ass. Beautiful goal.
He only ever scores screamers
Weird how we all laughed when Everton signed both Gray and Townsend. Their goals could still fall off though. Everton tend to be good to begin with and then they fall back to their customary 8th position.
Given all the money they have spent over the last few seasons it's sods law that a free and a 1.5mil player seem to have given them a new edge.
Gray did well to put it away, but the ball to him was absolutely inch perfect
Man U fan and I know it’s early to call but demerai gray could be potentially be the signing of the season. I’m not basing it just on his goals but his overall play has been great.
Townsend only scores screamers
Rafa is coming back. FACT! 😅
Townsend is always good for one banger a season
Wait why did Townsend just become Salah for a game
It’s so good to have fans back, what a game!
Burnley down this season I really hope
Every so often Townsend turns in Arjen Robben
Always liked Rafa and think he will do well with Everton this season good luck too them ✌️
Has Townsend ever scored from inside the box? 😂
Townsend should be in England’s starting 11
Townsend has scored a few screamers in his career!!! Take a bow sir 👏🏿👏🏿
Benitez is goat 🖤🤍
Rafa is a genius 👏 grey n townsend are on fire 🔥 Everton core was always strong his only added couple average wingers on paper and the team is flying with the wingers on rebull 😆
I enjoy every single premier league game just because of how loud the crow screams when the goals is scored 😍😍
Everton crowd was great tonight
Townsend scores once a year and its always a banger
What a goal from Townstart
Better see Townsend get at least 86 shot power on the next fifa
They were some fantastic goals
"unbelievable turnaround" coming back from 1-0 down against Burnley, at home.
Look at what happens when players get given confidence. Rafa has done wonders with gray and Townsend
Townsends a funny one!!
That was a blinder take a bow townsend 👏👏👏
Townsend only scores those screamers
Townsend has a banger in him
Sigurdsson’s doing a different comeback
Burnley at 54' : We scored, we got this in the bag  Burnley not 20 minutes later: :O
Happy for both Gray & Townsend, both high quality players at a very good club now.
I can't wait for this season's Merseyside Derby!!
Townsend absolutely unplayable today
Good game. Townsend involved in the 3 goals... But his goal is classic.
Is 3-1 an epic comeback tho?
WOW! Just imagine "Gray x75 " gets you "Sancho ×1"  *Quick Maths... Quack Quack!
If players were only judged by their highlight reel you'd think Townsend was the GOAT
That was such an epic comeback
Everton come from behind to romp Burnley.
Townsend only knows worldies
I hope Everton smash Liverpool twice this season.
Townsend wasn't gonna let Ronaldo take all the limelight to himself!
Yes, from 1-0 down, epic comeback😐
The long forgotten long ball game, proof it still works....
Can't believe how perfect that Townsend goal was.
Townsend always has a screamer in him
Love that I got bored and turned this off at half time
No stopping that one, BANG!
Gray was such a steal!
1:38 Townsend. Mazzalean. 💥💥💥💥
People laughed at Everton signing Gray and Townsend .... Fair play Benitez. Liverpool fan
Townsend done well there
Happy days at Everton they looking good
I knew Rafa would get Everton to be a more resilient team they go down a goal a year or so ago, they get hit on counter to go down 2 and that would be that, hopefully Evertonians are finally realizing they got a very good manager, I know it’s early days but considering the funding both LFC and EFC have got this season we both doing good, would love to see both LFC and Everton in the CL next year, imagine if we drew each other in the draw ✍️ 🤔 b amazing!
Brilliant
"Epic comeback"?
Townsend was always too good for Palace,  so much talent never got a chance at a big club, Spurs let him go as he didnt fit the Racial Profile
"I know, I'll let Townsend cut inside on his left foot! That's sure to end well!"
What a goal, Everton second half were class, just need that consistency for 90 mins and they can go far this season
Burnley’s end fell when they scored an limbs for townsend & grays goals Up the toffees 🔵
Thats what it takes to break Burnley down worldies and bangers. Burnley make you earn your goals
They really missed decoure last season
rafa is a class act
Like most I wasn’t pleased with rafa signing for us but he is one of the best at directing average squads to gel together and play some good football. Goodison was rocking. Townsend and Gray two stars. Delighted with the team
0:18 what is Pickford doing lol
Does Rodriguez still play for Everton
Goal of the month by Townsend
Where are the Everton fans who were questioning rafa Townsend and Gray now
Does anyone know what actually happened to Sigurdsson
Definitely top 6 if squad stay fit
COYB!!!!! YES :-P
I’m a Man United fan but I still got goosebumps for the final goal
Got absolutely mugged off last year for saying Grey was quality. Hopefully he can prove me right this season
That last goal assistance by Doucoure! Whatta splitting Pass! That shouldn’t have been allowed! Straight illegal!
You can’t hate townsend man. He comes every season to score a puscas contender then doesn’t score until the next season. And his performances aside from that are also great to watch.
Townsend should be in the England squad
That ball was perfect from doucoure
the fact that everton were able to get both townsend and gray for 2 mil is mental
Demarai Gray looks an absolute steal for the money they paid for him. Will he finally fulfil his obvious potential?
Every season
Gray is definitely the bargain of the season
Get gray an England calluP
doucore has had the best start of any other player in the prem after pogba
As a United fan Benitez deserves to start getting credit
Townsend should play for England, The man got skills
Goal of the season
I’m lfc fan, was worried when heard Benitez took over he’s a manager to take very seriously
Townsend str8 in top 20.prem long range scorers in PL history. Maybe top 10
Underrated player is that Townsend.   Was always a fan of him when he was at Spurs. Just never given the chance as bale was there
Poor game for ref Burnley should’ve had pen first half and kept getting fouls wrong for both teams
made me scream without the s
I swear Townsend doesn’t score tap ins lol 😂😂
Demari Gray could easily be bargain of the season by end of the season
Everton fans at the start of the season: Townsend and Gray are poor signings. Everton fans now: Best transfer business ever.
Fantastic lads 💙💙💙 Up the Toffees 💙💙
Andros Townsend today was just🔥🔥🔥
I’m a spurs fan and I always think we sold Townsend too early, such an entertaining player to watch, what a goal!
How was first goal allowed 🤦‍♂️🤷‍♂️... clear push on the defenders back as he jump for the ball, not once but twice, absolute nonsense officiating 😒
Any Everton fans still unhappy that rafa is manager?  Hahaha
Why is no one talking about how good doucoure was today?
Townsend loves a screamer init.fairplayyy
Stuck £30 on 3-1... thanks lads :D £300 Return not to shabby!
Wouldn’t exactly call coming back from 1 nil down an epic comeback.   Unbelievable goal from Townsend though
Townsend turning up for his Annual Screamer before ghosting. Demari Gray was born for counter attacks, just needs to stay consistent with his end product 🙏
Of course he scored a screamer
I was sat right behind the goal and a few people sat round me were like ‘No Andros don’t shoot’ and as soon as it left his foot me, my dad and my grandad all shouted ‘thats in that’ absolutely bargain and Gray’s goal was superb what a pass by Doucouré UTFT 🔵⚪️🔵⚪️
Andres townsend is seriously underrated
What a night 💙
Amazing stuff by Everton midway through the 2nd half.
the most incredible thing is that he is not even looking at the goal, just knows exactly where to put it.
Some of the players in the Burnley squad like McNeil and Pope deserve to be in a better team…
This was a beautiful watch!
no time stamps to see when the goals were scored - rubbish highlights.
Andros doesn't half score some pearlers
alright goal from townsend tbf
Absolute filth Burnley, can't wait for them to be relegated
What a great win !!!! COYB.
Townsend is the greatest player alive for one game annually
1:38 I'd be happy if I scored that goal in FIFA 😂
Andros townsend - The Aldi Robben
Why Leicester got rid of demari gray I never know. He is brilliant!!
Abdoulaye Doucoure,, what a player!
Thank u Everton you won me £50 for my accumulator
Everton showed some aggressive attacking football
Well done Rafa as well great tactical changes
The fact that grey went for another knee slide
Burnley will go down this season
Townsend always scores screamers
Ramsdale is better than pope & that’s not saying much. Well overrated
@2:09, what a pass from Doucouré.
Excellent from Rafa. Never in doubt
1:37
Townsend returning with his annual screamer
I hope Burnley get relegated. Such a dirty team.
@1:39, this Townsend fella only scores banger isd 😭😭😭.
Whenever Townsend scores it’s a banger
Gray and Townsend already showing more than any player we've spent massive money on. Just shows hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard. We were absolutely brilliant last half an hour.
Sky just ignoring the scissor tackle from behind on Richarlison by Brownhill also the ref because there's only 90 seconds on the clock no yellow Burnley always purposely trying to hurt the opposition
Iwobi has a lot of competition in front of him 😂
@0:08, this guy is actually an unreal player, Dwight McNeill is so, so underrated 🤩🤩🤩.
I've always rated townsend tbh tekky player
Gary is an absolute steal
💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
I do t do if buts or maybes I do absolutes and demarai gray is the best player in the world
bloody burnley
Fair play to Everton, Benitez must be doing something right?, United fan btw:)
Docures pass 🔥
Doucoure was outstanding again and Coleman had a great captains performance. The whole team pulled together so well when they needed to. Something that was missing last year defo. Ronaldo and Messi wear Demarai Gray pyjamas
Who else remembers when Andros Townsend was England's best player by a country mile? How the times have changed
Yed
It’s great to be a Newcastle fan watching this knowing we had a manager like this…Good luck to Everton
Rob hawthorne proving yet again to be the best footy commentator on the planet
Trust in Rafa peeps, he likes his team to play good football but also wants his players to never give up. He'll buy good players for the money has and get rid off those that dont meet his standards. His been there done it all, sure his move to mersyside for his family...but he wants success as well. Forget about his LFC connection we'll always love him, but he'll do right by Everton too.
He scored one like that for Palace personally i wish Palace never let him go. really nice guy too
Townsend doesn't score simple goals does he?! What a strike!
Everton players who want to pad out their 'chances created' stats know who to pass to.
I love that Damerai Gray is doing so well at Everton you guys deserve him
Rafa now has 3 goals in 6 minutes with both Merseyside clubs
I swear this man only scores screamers
Townsend is possess of scoring bangers tbh. Lol
Time for Townsend to go into hiding for the rest of the season now
Is sigurdsson injured or being left out? How is he not playing under rafa
Why did Pope bother diving for Townsend's goal?? - he got nowhere near it! 😄
Gray and Townsend are gonna be the signings of the season
Still like what about Gray? He’s been on fire so far this season 🔥🔥🔥
I feel for McNeil, such a good player, deserves to play with a team more his style, that pass he made to wood 🥰
Andy Townsend a good free signing for Everton  and it is good performance all around
Never seen Townsend score a normal goal
Townsend looking like a 50m player on his day,mahrez bernado silva type of quality that does it more consistently signing of season
What a game!
Imagine palace releasing Townsend 😩
Townsend and his annual screamer came early. This means he’ll be non existent until next season.
the select number of Everton fans who were livid about Benitez being appointed for his former Liverpool status are silent as the grave now.    Ancelotti developed their quality but had no real experience not being one of the strongest sides  in a division.  Benitez is gonna take that developed talent and add his ability to grind out games, to win when they're not at their best. to win against superior teams, to win with less of the ball, to punch above their weight.  it's between Tottenham, Everton, West Ham and Leicester for the Europa League spots.   Chelsea, City, United and Liverpool will have the top four locked down tight, and no other team in the league can then encroach on this top 8.
that pass from Doucoure for grey!
im a leicester fan but when demari gray left i was kinda sad cause he has soo much potentional and look at him now. Wish all the best to you my friend
Everton signing Gray and Townsend for a combined 2 million was brilliant business
Townsend.....just wow
Townsend. Only scores absolute screamers.
burnley defenders seem to ALLWAYS be out of position day dreaming
Great game. Love the blues.
So pleased to see Demari Grey find a team that he's settled into, what a player he is.
Derami Gray could prove to be bargain of the season. What a talent 🔥
Townsend will have a nice highlight reel to retire with
Listened to this on the radio - fantastic second half for Everton.  Jealous as an Arsenal fan lol!
Townsend's obligatory season screamer has came a bit early this time.
Tripe munchers,I hope they go down!
Demarai Grays valuation show how criminally underrated he was. Delighted to see him doing well. Equally happy to see Townsend getting some shine as well.
Everton could’ve had 5 or 6
Andros Townsend is the definition of "Not a great goalscorer but a scorer of great goals."
Next game Townsend will play like Andreas pereira
Townsend only scored good goals
nah how does townsend do this. this guy is smth else honestly
he doesnt score tap in this townsend guy
GOAL OF THE SEASON
Pleased for him. We were nuts to let such a hardworking talent leave the club.
Doucoures playmaking so underrated bruh
Everyone laughed at Benitez with the likes of Townsend signing. Fair play to him
Demarai Gray is underrated even at Leicester 🔥
Doucoure coming like Yaya Toure
That Townsend goal 😍 he scored a banger every season!
Townsend is looking like a baller again!
Does townsend have a bad goal in him?
Townsend we miss u 😂❤️💙
Townsend is a G!
I don't think Townsend scores tap ins
When dosnt Townsend score screamers let’s be honest here
Sad that gilfi isn't even making the bench these days at Everton 👀
Burnley are horrible to watch
„Epic comeback”
What a screamer from Townsend 🔥
Townsend goal is all well and good, but that pass from Doucoure to play Gray though was pure filth.
All down to Benitez. The mans shear class. Everton will be in top 4açd be  challenging next year for title. Pool fan here in peace! 😊
Townsend=tap in merchant
Best bit of the live commentary on the BBC....the guy doing it seems to think Everton bought Gray from Leicester. I know his time in Germany was brief but still....
These commentators are far superior to Martin Tyler now. He has lost his passion.
Need a screamer? call Townsend. What a player, underrated
Townsend doesn’t always score but when he does its thing of beauty.
Tonsend only scores screamers baby
Wanting Everton to Do Well this Year, Proper Club from the Working Class Roots of Liverpool. Respect from Leeds 🟡🟡👍🔵🔵
Feels like I’ve seen that Townsend goal before
Townsend must have the best average in goal quality.
Gonna be honest forgot this game was on… ded teams
Gray 1.2 Million 😂👌🏻. From a Man Utd fan that is unreal value 👏🏻. He could easily end up leaving for 20+ Million
We have been blessed with stunning goals in this premier league opener
The pass for the last goal deserves some recognition
Sky your playback is a touch quick. Very Benny Hill, Everton don’t play that quick
Does Townsend ever not score screamers. I can see most comments saying the same thing below but I am hitting send anyways
In Spain we say Townsend is Lewis Hamilton with the hair ok Good evening
Liking thr look of everton this season
Didn’t even look at the goal lol. Knew where it was and just leathered it.
Townsends technique is underrated he's been scoring goals like that time and time again. Remember the one at Crystal Palace against Man City?
Lovely stuff Everton. UTR 🔵⚪
How does Benitez keep turning bang average players into footballing demigods?
It felt like Burnley had their number in the first half. I honestly don't know where those 3 goals came from, Crazy game..
It takes an ex Liverpool manager to get Everton to play like a Liverpool team. 😉
There’s a man smiling just before Gray shoots. So epic, he knows he’s gonna bury it. Fans make football >
I love it when I know a everyon fan that gave up his season ticket cause Rafa was appointed 😂😂😂😂😂 he's gutted now.
Rocket 🚀
Can someone acknowledge the jump Keane made. Fabulous.
What an assist from Dacoure
Townsend!!!!
Townsend has to be one of the best at scoring absolute stunners
Bru Townsend playing like he’s prime Robben haha
If Wood made contact with the first chance of the game, Pickford would have done a Van Dijik on him
That through ball was amazing
If you just looked at Andros Townsend's highlight reel you'd think he was a ballon d'Or nominee.
I don't know how Rafa got his trustworthy players but to see Townsend playing like this is amazing. I thought he was past it. Amazing when he's confident and runs at players. Gray is a good signing too
Gray's touch was absolutely perfect there. Made it easy to score.
Townsend rly could've been one of the prems best, he is underrated af!
Mightve been a thunderous strike, but what a banging save!!!
Dwight McNeil is such a baller
There is nothing like football with fans like nothing at all comes close
I said Benitez was a top top manager! makes Mourinho look like a mannequin! If he had been given total control and backing at Newcastle he could've achieved something. Everton have given him the chance to shine, and its looking bright in Merseyside right now🤗
Wat an absolute utter utter rocket!! Top corner got battered there.
2:10 try doing that throughball on Fifa
You won’t see townsend now for the rest of the season
Townsend hitting thunderbolts like he’s Zeus
You just know townsends gonna bang that
That collective "GO ON" from the crowd at 2:09 gave me goosebumps. Great to have the fans back.
Same old Everton , when they play like Real Madrid when they play like Arsenal 🙈
People want Nick Pope constantly in the England net. Yes he couldn't of done anything about the goals but all he does is pick up the ball out of the net repeat. You guys seriously telling me he's better than Pickford? Internationally Pickford's an animal! Barely makes any mistakes and distribution is solid. Pope on the 3rd goal in my opinion didn't even looked bothered!
Townsend doesn’t even look at the goal before hitting it, wonderstrike. 🤩
well done Everton
Townsend channeling his inner Arjen Robben. What a strike
Everton really came back from 0-1 like that
So happy for Demarai, finally showing he’s the player he was always meant to be
Gray bargain of the season
Townsend scores a screamer every season. Today, we saw it
That driven pass at 2:11 was perfect
I'm sorry but the fact that Townsend wasnt looking at the goal is insane he looked for someone for the pass then immediately head down bang what a goal
Arsenal fans thought Benitez was a downgrade 😂😂😂
How was no one else looking at Demarai Gray for 1.5 million.
I know it's early in the season but what was most Everton fans saying about Rafa?🤣
You wouldn’t thin sean dyce is burnleys manager the way Burnley are playing currently maybe they’ll do a title charge in the second half of the season who knows 🤷🏻‍♂️
Good luck to Everton, I'm a Newcastle fan and my club is dead, Rafa is class and I hope they finish above one of sky's beloved "Big 6" and upset the cartel.
Townsend will disappear now for another 3 years til he scores a screamer
commentators were 10/10 tonigjt
I’m so but people doubt Townsend! 30 years of age and he’s still performing and scoring these stunners
Today Mach was great love the blues💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💛💙💛💙💛💙💛
Pope best english keeper no doubt
What a GOAL!! Townsend weren't even looking... Just SMAAAASHHH
Rafa the Red is forever gonna be Benitez the Blue from now on  COYB
Gray is a sensational signing. Always loved him. Delighted his career is off and running
his goal against city better though
Put some Respect on Rafa Benitez’s name
The pass @ 0:08 is out of this world.
Cheers Everton
Townsend is one of the most underrated player in the Premier league if you really think about it
Two disallowed goals not in the highlights? Come on Sky!!
Shocking atmosphere at this game
Townsend sends the whole town crazy
Only real ones know Townsend loves himself a seasonal screamer
What a game 💙 COYB !!!
Doucores pass to gray 👏
Townsend only scores from 30 yards......
i know it was just a 1 on 1 but they were right in saying that Demarai Gray never looked like he was going to miss,  confidence flowing through him at the moment!
Townsend has one of the best long shots in the league . Very under rated player . That volley against city was class too
Demari gray is such a bargain. Well done Everton
Great save from Pope. Townsend is on fire
Demari Gray a STEAL
Unforgivable that Hodgson and FraudGate didn't pick Townsend more for England. Unreal player
Demarai Gray been in great form recently
Good vibes from fan base Toffy
Gray has done more in 4 games than Iwobi has done in 2 years 👀
Benitez is working his magic with a couple of retreads in Gray and Townsend - they are absolutely flying.
Everyone: Townsends screamer  Me: That ball by Doucoure
Townsend oxlaide are England’s best midfielders
Watched this live once Burnley scored the Everton fans booed the 💩💩💩outta them and Everton went attacking crazy
Pope: don’t you even think about it  Townsend: I’m about to end this mans carer 💣 WHAT a GOAL 👀
Sublime performance from Everton but Pope shoulda done better on the Townsend goal , he had time to adjust and save that shot...
as a birmingham fan, is great to see Andros and Demarai playing well ! Good luck guys, smashing it so far ! KRO
The fact that Townsend doesn’t even look at the goal he just looks to his left then looks down and bang, always bangers from him goal of the season already
That's Townshend done for about 3 years then
What a goal from the man Townsend!
No Evertonians moaning about Rafa now eh.
DEMARAI OLE OLE OLE
At least Gray’s knee slide is better
Could Everton break into the top 7🤔
I hope this is the season Burnley go down.
AV that 👍👍👍👍   UTFT
I still remember when Andros Townsend’s broke out in Tottenham. That season he was seriously a prospect if not for injuries. This proves how much a manager’s trust is important to a player. WHAT A BANGER!🥶🔥
Outstanding second half from Everton. Burnley are so dull and negative.
Everton is the best team in Merseyside! Absolute GOATS
Great second half from the toffies ... andros was class tonight
Goal of the season so far , side netting from that distance ⚽️ 🥅 👏
YPOTY so far has been Demarai Gray. Boy has been so good going forward….and Leicester sold him away back then to get Lookman now. Seems like a loss to them for me still
Townsend and Demari Grey, absolute steals! Great business by the toffees.
So happy gray is doing well right now..this player has a big future
great commentary for this match, hyped up the goals perfectly well
Nick Pope will need to go to the hospital after that worlde from Townsend
Rafa out right ? 😂😂😂
This is what I was afraid of when Rafa went to Everton - a couple of good wins early on that gets the fans united behind him, and gets everyone believing they can always get back into the game, even if they're a goal or two behind.   If he keeps this up he could build something special there. Might even win a trophy for them.
I’ve always said Townsend is an underrated player
Townsend and Gray 2021 version of Arteta and Pienaar
Happy for Gray hope he keeps this form up 🔥
Everton signing Townsend and Gray attracted a lot of stick, proving the doubters wrong
Goal of the season
For the doubters.RAFFA RAFFA RAFFA. class manager.
"He's got his reward here by just being alive"  That's grade A commentary for Burnley's goal 😎
Where is James Rodriguez?
I always knew gray would perform
Where are all the Everton fans crying about Rafa, Townsend and Gray? Fickle...
Townsend ONLY SCORES BANGERS.   So happy to see him starting well at Everton, loved him at spurs 🤍
I love the way Townsend looks away into the stands before he hits it.
I love that no one danced after scoring.   Townsend pointing to the fans.   His face was a picture.    He felt that roar to the absolute core and he’ll never be the same ever again.
Come on Everton Fans...Start Singing Rafa's Praises....He is Doing a Great Job There for You Guys.
Townsend was excellent in that 2nd Half and what a goal from him. Good 3 points tonight. Can't moan with 10 points in 4 games. Still too early in the season but its good to be positive for once. Villa will be a tough test on Saturday
A promising start to the season. No doubt most supporters were less than impressed signing Gray and Townsend. Right now, they're turning out to be astute signings. Hopefully so will Rondon.
Jordon Pickford the legend and leader if everton 💙💙💙💙
Kids in 20 years are going to think Townsend was on Gerrard and Lampards level cos of these goals
As a Liverpool, am I worried about Everton. Like f### I am.  World class goal by Townsend by the way 👏👏
Townshend didn't even look up where the goal was when he scored
As a Leicester fan I think we where stupid to sell gray but glad to see him doing well
Benitez,    You are shutting up those Everton fans now. You are to good for that club. Good on you Rafa.Newcastle look at what you are missing.
Gray has been a revelation at everton
YES COYBS
According to the description this was played at Turf Moor it sure looks like Goodison Park these days.
Townsend channeling his inner Bale
Brilliant header from Keane
Amazing what Rafa can do with a half decent squad.
Rafa lowkey doing a great job @Everton.
Townsend scoring a wonder goal every season is more likely than Arsenal ever having hope of hearing the champions league music
Townsend really wants goal of the season
Gray showing what all the hype was about a couple years ago
Seesh Townsend 😱👍
so the disallowed goal wasnt even in the highlights........
I kinda got Richarlisons shirt😊
2:50 and it just keEps
Great start lads. It's all about consistency now and keeping that hunger and desire to work for each other and the team..... COYB
Townsend changing the game in three minutes. Everton of old battering teams over twenty minutes. Brilliant performance from every man, although digne struggled to assert himself
Townsend just doesn't do tap ins...
Everton turned on the heat after going down, the pressure made Burnley's defense crumble
That knee slide celebration of Gray was smoother than my pickup lines... 😂
Every time burnley score they switch off and concede it’s not good
imo his volley vs city few seasons back was much better, also what the hell is pope's awful positioning? still a great goal though, very easy on the eye had to replay it a few times
Townsend saying “Gareth you watching this fella” 👏
💙👍
What is Andros Townsend on?!
Townsend 🚀
What a knee slide by gray 🔥🔥🔥
Townsend wasn’t even looking at the goal when he scored wtf
Townsend has already used up his annual screamer 😂
There was a 10 minute spell where Everton scored 3 goals and Doucoure played like Yaya Toure and Roy Keane rolled into one
Rafa's the perfect manager for Everton and Everton's the perfect club for Rafa
Burnley have taken over from Stoke City. Hope they go down.
Andros Townsend is the most Match of the Day footballer I’ve ever seen
Pope should be England’s no 1
This game was just… Fun!
Shout out “2 dogsLa”
What a goal from Townsend
Title contenders, no doubt.
I swear Townsend only scores stunners
Townsend on a free what a bargain showed what he can do at Newcastle Rafa knows his business
Townsend turning into Ronaldinho
Burnley kit🔥🔥
Gray has always been a good player, it’s great to see him Finally prove himself properly
Townsend proving to be a very astute piece of business from Rafa. I mean what did we expect, what a manager and Townsend is actually proving the quality that got him into the England setup all those years ago.
Penandes got an all angles video Townsend should get one for that banger 😪
Everton are a different beast under Rafa
My mood went from: 🤦‍♂️😐 Straight to: 🔥🥵👏
Proof that Rafa Benitez gets the best out of his players
looks like tarkowski is celebrating gray’s goal 😭
Goooo on Demari prove those fkrs wrong! KRO

Goal of the month confirmed, what a goal! Townsend has a proper left foot
Benitez always loved the blues
Take a bow Andros lad 😍
Townsend > Robben
Why does everyone want Burnley to get relegated? 😂😂😂
Omg
That was insane by Townsend
Rafa is such a good manager
Wow townsend roll back them years. Where have you been. I remember when you scored that curler against yanited in the man utd comeback 3-2 at crystal Palace

Who else thought townsend and gray were gonna flop??
Everton have not spent much but the signings they have are great
Townsend and Gray are like Messi and Ronaldo under Rafa lol
Townsend is one of the players who rarely score but when they it's a screamer
One of the best goals I have ever seen
Townsend always scores a screamer a season like if I’m right
Townsend only knows screamers what a goal 🙌
Who else remembers townsneds volley against city

First
Andros.
Quickest sky sports upload😂

Madting
Townsends known for this stuff
