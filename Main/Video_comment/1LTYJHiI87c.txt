Hell and destruction are never full; so the eyes of man are never satisfied.   (Proverbs 27:20) - Jesus Christ is our only Savior. Repent, The Lord is coming soon.

Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping you from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Huncho for priminister
2 words...might as well 🤣🤣
🐐🐐🐐
craig mitch!!! hardest host ever on a sneaker show! shout outs!!
Huncho said he planned his legacy and it shows, we can expect him to evolve each album, man has his bag locked down… he also said he draws inspiration from MF Doom for his mask so it’s going to be part of his brand as he says
"Are they reasonable price?"  Proceeds to spend nearly £600 on 3 pairs of slides 😭

chashh from top boy is m huncho 💯
Orthopaedic ting lmao
He’s breathing ok
The amount of times he says like
i think that by only seeing his eyes it gives his audience (us) the oppertunity to skip past a lot of bullshit and just see it as it is. you can tell alot about a person just by looking them in the eyes and i think that huncho knows that to.
My man needs to brush his teeth
