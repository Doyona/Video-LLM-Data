ik you just saw it, u dont have to say anything, but if u were to give 1 emoji describing ur reaction, what would u put?
It could be hush.
Riddler is going to break Batman mentally.
I can't see Twilight as Batman
LMAO U R A FOOL !!!
If this movie comes out the way it looks in the trailer, it will be a masterpiece..!!  Because people always gets connected to a emotional background and history behind a person's personality...The Batman is an emotional character and people need to know the drive or reason behind a man becoming vigilante for his whole life....as we know " when you devote yourself to an ideal and if they can't stop you, then you become a legend". Like DC did the humanizing touch for JOKER - MASTERPIECE. RIDDLER looks to expose the corruption in Gotham City and the Court of Owls to the Batman and also mocking Batman ideals of JUSTICE. A noir detective movie, a mixture of movies "SEVEN" and "ZODIAC". BATMAN is not only fighting outside but also fighting within himself. As a year 2 Batman, it will be interesting to see that how the internal chaos and fighting of ideals within himself gets him transformed from "VENGEANCE" to "JUSTICE". I hope this comes out exactly like I mentioned.
i would love to see riddler as the villain in this movie. i think the question mark 2021 at the really foreshadows him.
"oh by the way i got a hat."    *best part of the entire video tbh*
Can't lie to myself. The 90s Batmobile has my whole attention.
Wait, who's the next Bat Man? Anyways, looks like it's gonna be a great movie! I'm so excited!
They should make a robin and nightwing  movie with red hood as the villain
andres face *whoa*
1:40 most appropriate reaction 😂
I love the music
I think it great they got Zoe Kravitz to reprise her role as Catwoman.   “Meow meow you’re in meow meow”
1:40, 5:00 and 5:50.
Liked the ? mark release date.
I'm feeling the Court of Owls honestly.... Riddler has clues to their existence but can't just tell Batman haha
DC movies SUCK!!! Only good thing was batman almost all of their movies that are badass were all about batman.  Wonder woman is good. But lets face it.... batman is the best!!!!
love the gremlins shirt Andre
Your the best
can you do a other gremlins video
Joker (2019) & The Batman (2021) Same Cinematic Universe  !!!!
I'm already a Pattinson fanboy after seeing Good Time and The Lighthouse. I can't wait for this movie!
Hey Andre, I wonder if u remember my name
Sorry to hear about Chadwick today, RIP
Not sure if you're gonna read this but have you or anyone you know ever seen Freddie as F.R.O.7 (aka Freddie the Frog)
Andre sounding like Joker with that laugh though
I'm starting to have a bad feeling about this batman, if you look at Ben Aflecks batman and the rumors about the "creative differences" and start connecting dots Batfleck was a hard brutal bat, think warehouse fight, it's reported the studio wanted to go in a different direction than Aflecks vision, I think that means we are going to see a whiny more emotional battinson
RIP Chadwick Boseman.
Black Panther died
Seems like they're focusing more on the Detective side of Batman rather than just the Superhero side of Batman which I am completely down for
That was really awesome I watched it several times and watched other videos tomorrow let's find out what was hidden in the little Easter eggs here in there
I love the trailer
Is it just me?? Or does the piano in the score (at least in this trailer) kinda have a Darth Vader-esque vibe??🤔 I’m honestly all for it. This trailer was AWESOME💪🏽🔥
wowwwwww ሙሉውን ቪድዮ በማየት ቤታችሁ ገብቻለው  እረሶም ሁሉንም በሟሟላት በታማኝነት ቤተሰብ ይሁኑ
Idk if anyone else caught it...but I enjoyed seeing your face light up for a quick second when he says “ I’m vengeance”. God this trailer gets me going
the logo tell all omg it's horror theme
i love dano for so long .it's like a dream that he is chosen to be the riddler. we saw how he so ask for kicking in the prisoners . he must be so creeepy, cynical, psycho one of coolest riddler
I've seen this damned trailer at least 100 times. Smh.
Looks like garbage
I can’t wait for this movie!
THis looks promising. Plus I love your reactions! ,😂
forget riddler i wanna know when do we get a batman movie with mad hatter?
Not gonna lie. This movie is giving me fan fourstick vibes.....
The scene when batman punches the guy looks to me like when a spoiled brat punches his sisters Barbie
5:55 this might be my favorite response to that scene lol From Batman's perspective: "Oh, you're still moving..." (whack whack) "There, problem solved."
I’m fairly certain this Batman is looking for Joel Schumacher.
I love robs voice! Better sounding !
Can you please do a reaction to ShadowSpear2 YouTube channel of HE'S  fan made video of original kratos voice Tc Carson as kratos in God of war 2018  please
Bro! I have a quick question! How do you put your picture on your thumbnail WITHOUT the border around you?? I've been trying to figure that out for days now LOL! Thanks man!
Is it just me or does Pattinson without the mask look like Eric Mabius in The Crow Salvation?
🤣🤣🤣 "Ahh thank god its ov.. wait no no no"
take this dumpster fire and throw it in the trash were it belongs, this garbage isnt even redbox worthy
this is what a railer should be! im hyped!
It reminds of the movie Seven.
Am I wrong for feeling like this Riddler is kind of being melded with Anarky? I mean, I dig it, anything to make the Riddler actually feel like a threat.
I was having regrets about pattinson but this trailer is making me question it
I LOVED how they made the riddler scary in the Gotham TV series. This looks like it's on a whole other level
It looked like the villian maybe Hush, who also played more to the Detective side of Batman which I'd definitely be a fan of. Riddler's great to tho
I feel compelled to mention since Black Nerd focused a bit on how we have only had one cinematic Riddler that Penguin is going to be in the movie too before he answers to that name.  He may still prefer going by Oswald Cobblepot in this one, however it's still another interpretation of Penguin technically since he still goes on to adopt that criminal name.  That means we have only had one movie Penguin & this will only be his second time in a cinematic movie, the first being Batman Returns with Danny Devito
Excited to see the court of owls. One of my friens pointed them out to me in the trailer
just waiting for someone to say "Doesn't look like anything to me" to Jeffrey Wright
“By the way I got a hat”
Looks super good!
Damn Batman straight dismembering goons. I dig it....
I think Robert Patterson is going to do good as Batman I know it doesn't feel right but I'm going to give him a chance
We got glimpses of Riddler, Catwoman, and a shot of Penguin in this trailer (Colin Farrell was unrecognizable), but I thought I heard that Two-Face, Firefly, and Mad Hatter were supposed to be in this movie as well.
I hated how batflecks voice sounded roboty with the voice changer,so this is a good change
That Batman suit has the drip.
They gave her a Pfeiffer type cowl
This is the best trailer I've seen since Joker.
I don't understand why people had a problem with Selina's mask. It's not like she can afford the best state-of-the-art equipment for cat burglary like some billionaire Playgirl philanthropist.
Beats the guy's face to a pulp, stops to break his arm, goes back to the face, guy goes down, continues punching until there's nothing but soup. Eat shit, Batfleck.
I really, really hope Batman doesn't kill.
I stopped giving an F about super hero movies after the Dark Knight. Dark Knight was good. *THIS* one ... oh my gosh, *this* is the kind of super hero movie I enjoy a lot - where it feels real, dark, gritty - where the villains are probably actually real in some not so far away ivory tower watching the whole world burn beneath them. And that punch ... wow - I expected him to stop but when he went back a second time -  I'm sold. I'm hooked. Patterson is going to be an amazing Batman - better than Christian Bale. I like the voice - not as forced raspy as Bale's, which got annoying. I'm ready for this one. I never been more hyped for a super hero movie in a *very* long time.
looks like arkham knight batman
I think Affleck set the precedent. But hopefully all future Batmen will know how to fight. Pattison definitely got the memo
"I'm vengeance." CHILLS.
Anyone notice Colin Ferrell's  Penguin?
Before this trailer, everyone hated Robert Pattinson and casually now he is a great Batman, he is a great actor and those kind of things, people is strange.
I don't mind Gordon’s actor but he would have been so good as Lucius fox.
How do you like the worst batman ever made?  There's a reason that was the only batman with nipples and puns.
I said Affleck was not my Batman and it's feeling like Pattinsona not my Batman either.  Bale felt right and it was awesome.  Lately everything DC non animated (except a wonder woman, not sure about the new one) has been trash. We'll see I guess.
This might be my favorite version of Batman. The suit is epic too
this is the weakest and gayest batman its like when they gave us the suicide squad  joker its just not a good idea
I love your reaction, but I'm not sure this is going to be the Batman for me.  I'm still not convinced Robert Pattinsnon is the right actor for this role.  The only two actors that I think got it right were Adam West and Michael Keaton.  Everyone else either played Batman well or the played Bruce Wayne well.  This seems like they might be trying to take us on a head trip like Joker or The Crow - Brandon Lee (both movies I really liked).  You can only go so far with that premise in a Batman story, before it gets tiring.  At lease with a comic, you can put it down and come back to it.  If I spend money to watch the movie, I got to stay and take it.  And if I feel like that, then it won't be good to me.  I'll probably wait until everyone sees it and delivers their opinions on it.  I know what I'm listening for to determine if it's worth going to a theater or waiting to see on which platform it pops up on first.
I didn't think Gotham as a city could get anymore grittier after the tv series ended but i was wrong
The double villain thing has got me concerned. Most of the trailer looks pretty damn good but.....why both Riddler AND Catwoman? Im hoping she isnt in the movie much, just enough to set up the world.
Great review brother. Much better reaction/review then angry Joe. Greetings from Ireland.
What happened to your Riverdale reviews????
Lmao great reaction brotha hope you’re having a blessed day ❤️
Can’t wait to see this movie everybody on youtube iOS talking about this 🍿
This trailer gave me the chills. It was so good!
They gotta make it R Rated!
Andre you are awesome dude
Great reaction and thought    Can't wait for ?0?1
WHAT THE HELL was that noise at 00:41 SEC???🤔
Epitome of beat your ass down.
I’m getting tired of Batman or Superman movies, let’s give Mr. Freeze or Lex Luther a movie, maybe, we can make a movie about The Riddler or Deathstroke
Right now, this riddler is reminding me of the Gotham tv show Riddler... which is good.
That's just robert beating/punching ppl who have doubts when he got the batman role
You don’t even recognize the penguin in this movie does not look like Colin Farrell
Check out my YouTube channel 😳
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates..Non-Duality
This is going to be GREAT!
1000
Nirvana wrote that song as a joke,  said all you have to do is sing random words to a slow tempo and people think it is meaningful.   Probably an good metaphor for this crap........
Hey      Why blqck
Hell yes this looks amazing!! But...will this movie top Batflecks appearance in Flash?
I must say this trailer like all the ones I have seen from this event is very impressive and honestly sells me one the movie quite well I can't wait to see more
Pattinson is genuinely a fantastic Batman! Absolutely realistic voice in the suit. I really think this looks awesome
And we're getting the World's Greatest Detective in this movie
Andre’s not unstable you are
Friendly reminder that Andre is a Blue Power Ranger. Can't wait for Morphicon to come back.
For the first time in over 30 years: THEY'VE MADE BATMAN CRAZY SCARY AWESOME AGAIN!
Wow in the beginning you looked like a bigger version of Tyler The Creator. Lol I had to do a double take
the batsuit could haved been made much better then it is, the batsuit just don't look all that great.
I dont think this batman kills People can survive a beat down like that Probably just with in an inch of their life
Batman is ROCKING that eye makeup, by the way.
2:19 *Anyone else thinks he looks a bit like Nightwing here?*
Nah, he didn't kill that dude. He just made sure he'll be taking his meals through a straw for the rest of his life.
So does look like the nostalgia critic getting beat up by Batman to anyone else but me?
We’ve been waiting for THIS reaction above all on the internet 🤗 Andre NEVER fails to deliver!!!😆😆😆👌🏾
I don't see Bruce Wayne here as Batman more like Terry McGinnis Batman Beyond.
Emo boy batman... Really??? Your ok with emo boy Batman
Looks like goth Batman is back.
5:54 - 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Black Jim Gordon better not mean black Batgirl.
I, like everyone else, had my assumptions about Robert Pattinson playing the Batman. But I think he freaking nailed it!!! Looks brutal, and that’d be awesome if it was some kind of sequel to Joker 🤔 CANNOT WAIT TO SEE THIS!!!
Gotta love Robert Pattinson's voice for The Batman.
rainout revarnishing
I hate how people judge pattinson for twilight when like why would you watch twilight in the first place lmao the people who don’t like his bits in the trailer and watching films that have under 2 star reviews Jesus lmao
I love your videos!!
The Batman looks damn good! Thought at first it was going to be hot trash but this looks good
I love that part too 😂 Also glad they didn't cut away a bunch for each choreographed move 👍 BIG PLUS!
I love Batman when he's vicious
I don’t think Batman kills. Comic Book Logic. I think if anything he gets close to that breaking point but doesn’t cross the line. The fanbase has been divided on him killing for years. There’s no way they’re trying it again unless they’re really confident in their story.
16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.  18 He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. John 3:16-18  Have an exceptional day.
My favorite part is when he brutally beat up that thug
The penguin doesnt look that bad
"Something in the way" Badass Nirvana song from back in the day. Unfortunately someone seems to be singing.
not my gordon
Hush is totally underrated villain
Yep, uncontrollable laughter over the overdone violence of beating a guy to death. This tells everything about why our nation is descending into Chaos and Anarchy.
It's weird, I was already so sold on Pattinson as Batman that I've become more excited to see what Paul Dano does as The Riddler.
I'm gonna have to see more of Pattinson as Batman in the next trailer because I still don't really see him as either Bruce Wayne or Batman. I always thought he'd be a better Dick Grayson, Damien Wayne, or Terry Mcginnis. I get that he's a younger Bruce and from what I understand, this movie will basically be a story blend of Batman Year 2 and The Long Halloween, which would be a nice take on Batman (not an origin story like Begins, but not long in his career like DCEU) and give Pattinson the option to make this a long-term role (I think he may be the youngest actor to play batman in a movie. Correct me if I'm wrong).
You’re so cool Dude
this was DEFS a better trailor...he beat the snot out of that gang banger!!!
Is this what happened to Edward after Bella dumped him? 🦇💔🤬🤔😂🤣
You look like Tyler the creator 😂❤️✌🏾
I feel like  the Villain  is Hush but Hush is the advanced version  of Riddler
I’m pretty sure this villain is hush considering he was obsessed with Batman/Bruce and he had his face covered up and had a trench coat and there was a lot questions surrounding his name and there seems to a lot of other villains such as catwoman so that would tie into the hush comics n the movie nooo 🧢
I didn't even think about "oh God, thanks it's over... Wait!!!!" I watched your narration of this twice.... 😂
I am so in. Love your enthusiasm always. This take has got me so hyped, i can't wait even though they have yet to shoot 75% of the production.
I am so excited to see Robbat Battin' Bat!
I love they went with Gotham knight
I loved it ..... I need a cigarette...
I’m so happy R. Pat is being generally received well. I have high hopes because he is a fine actor and chooses great rolls that work within his range. This shit looks dope and I am so excited. This gives me that true Batman feel. That dark gritty world. I’m sold and Ms. Kravitz is gonna kill it as Selena. What I really cannot wait for tho is the Riddler!! So cool
I love that one guy is filming it expecting his friend will kick Batman's ass, then keeps filming while his friend is beaten to a pulp.
The Ten piece Arkham Origins combo on dude sold me! 😎
no disrespect for Pattinson, but anybody can do better than batfleck
This batman looks pale and sick
I really didn't know anyone who complained about the Pattinson casting, even in the beginning. He looks awesome. :)
Hush cat woman and riddler are the bad guys my guess
He took his frustrations of Twilight out on that goon! Lmao
RIP Alfred
Man that 1 scene where Pattinson beat the hell outta that guy has got me SO HYPED FOR THIS MOVIE!!!!!OMG!!!!
I wish Patterson bulked up for the role like the studio asked him to. He looks way to small to play Bruce Wayne. But ill still give it a shot.
I'll watch anything with Jeffery Wright in it. Follow him on Twitter. He suffers no fools.
Twilight dude is no batman, movie does seem like it's gonna be good though. We'll see how he does overall when the time comes.
Only issue is, he doesn't have the bulk and height.....the suits on point, his voice is on point, but he looks more like a night wing / robin.
The voice. It works. Holy sh*t
Anyone else thinks that isn't Riddler but actually Hush instead? For what I know the Hush in comics is different than the Hush from the animated movie, right? Could this be the comic Hush?
So I wasn't the only one who laughed my ass off when Battinson started slapping that thug before punching and pounding him 🤣🤣🤣🤣 it's brutally hilarious. Like when your dad suddenly came and beat up the guy who bullies you
Sorry Andre man but I really disagree on this, honestly Robert Pattinson's  just doesn't do it for me at all as Batman.  Like the rest of the trailer isn't too bad I just can't take Pattinson's that seriously as a actor and it's not because of Twilight.
Nirvana song sure know how to make the trailer Hype AF
And there was also Penguin...
Loved that they played Nirvana in the trailer.
Me as Batman wailing on Joker gang leader:  Batman! He's down! He's DOWN! BATMAN!!!
Let see that again🤑
This shit looks ill af
The punches were for the twilight naysayers
Bro!!! I came in my pants too during the fighting scene!!
Two crossovers I would’ve loved to see:  • Christian Bale’s Batman vs. Brandon Routh’s Superman. • Robert Pattinson’s Batman vs. Joaquin Phoenix’s Joker.
That’s cause Christopher Nolan wanted this guy as Batman I can see why
They do have A LOT of versions of batman and the joker and i do agree that we need to see other villans they were just as important as the joker i feel and the next movie they need to start on is batman beyond. I really liked the futuristic look to gotham city and a new guy took over for batman it was refreshing  in an animated series.
I'm impressed with the choice of music. "Something's in the way" by Nirvana. Roughly a B-Side song from the "Nevermind" Album, but here...   Creepy as hell... and I love it. 😎
This looks like my new favorite Batman next to Affleck
That beatdown is going to be famous
Riddle me this why does every youtuber claim to be a  BatMan fan??
As a batman fan if I get a good detective movie with arkham style fights I'll be happy
Release the hype engine!
This Batman looks pretty cool. Different, but I am ok with that.
I hope he dosent kill I dont think so. that guys ......he’s ..he’s fine ....slight concussion...maybe coma
The Batman? More like- throw dem handsman! 😂
Penguin is in this movie
Supposedly Colin Farrell is in the trailer
Loved the response 🤣 and your 👕
I am just as excited as you are to see the movie! I definitely agree that it is time for a new take on the Riddler. Paul Dano will do an amazing job. The teaser was fantastic. I watched it so many times :D
it’s riddler & hush combined
Aye, if Heath Ledger from 10 Things I Hate About You became godlike with Joker, I had high expectations for Robert also. Never a doubt.
Robert Battinson
I wanted to be surprised by this trailer too. And I’m already sold. I was open to it for the casting from the start!
Who are the best fighters that plays Batman I thought Ben affleck's Batmanlike this one might be the first if he fights like that through most of the movie.
He hit him 11 times in 6 seconds. That's nuts.
I was getting more Hush vibes
If you are justice do not lie What is the price for your blind eye
I love that Riddler is mixed with Hush! Hoping they go with the Manson look from The Batman, maybe with a leather jacket and pants.
bat-brutallity
@Andre you actually manage to make a brutal assault funny as hell LMAO
Im just gonna say it now….if in the movie he says I am Vengence, I am the Knight…….I will then stand up in the middle of the theater and yell I am Batman!
Batman goes to china and beats the shit out of that guy who ate a bat and started covid.
1:37 Is that Hush?!?
I'm feeling this Fincher meets BTAS. Sign me up. I am the night
I actually don’t mind the new Batman. Honestly I don’t care I just need a good story with good acting by anyone willing to try.
Watching it again is pretty cool...
Batman was trying to get his Arkham combo to max level.
Andre's laugh sounds like Mark Hamils' joker lol.
He got a hat
I've seen Water for Elephants at least and Robert was great in that movie, I hope the writing of this movie is good
Already my favorite Batman tbh
_"Wait... are you still awake?  Can't have that...  GO TO SLEEP!"_  Was that _'LITHIUM'?_
Is it just me who thinks they've based the Riddler off the serial killer, 'The Zodiac Killer' in some ways here? He's more of a serial killer who has power and people following him.
Kudos to the director for not going for the obvious, "I'm BATMAN," moment and instead going with Vengeance.
I just think you want to see Batman beat up a white dude🙄🙄🙄 hey seeing the times were in I get it my dude I get you...😆😆😆😉
That hair! XD Love it
Had a very Crow-esque darkness compared to other Batman movies, for me. But as a non-fan, The Riddler is actually terrifying to me
"Oh thank god it's overNO NO NO NO!!!" - Black Nerd 2020 LOLOL
Honestly, if there have to be any more Batman movies I'm ready for a lighter Batman again.
It might be the Riddler but I get some Hush vibes from the villain too.
Call it right now: Robert Pattinson's Batman for Mortal Kombat 12 confirmed
2:28 That was amazing, same reaction I had, and the best part is that all that was shown was from about a quarter of the movie they made
All the doubts I had about this movie just evaporated!
I gotta be honest, i had sorta turned my nose up at Robert Pattinson playing Batman. I turned my nose back down when i watched him straight up pimp slapping ol' boy BEFORE he beat the brakes off him.🤣 (I see you Edward! 👀) I pray we can return to movie theaters next year.
Doesn't sound like he has throat cancer. Already like him more than Bale's version.
Im there! 👍
It’s amazing how I get more insight about the actual film here on this comment section as all the comments on the official trailer are just people trying to get likes and copying and pasting
This movie looks Fincheresque, as if it takes place in the universe from Se7en.
im down for a reference to the joker gang. though it more makes me want a movie focusing on the future Batman, Terry Mcginess (probably misspelled that)
Pattinson will suprise many playing Batman like Ledger did playing the Joker. They auditioned many actors and WB picked him for a reason.
Omg...this is the first Batman movie where they actually show Bruce with the eyeliner makeup.
That thug got hit with 9 rights he was probably begging for a left.  Then two more when on the ground lol
I have to admit this movie feels darker than even the Dark Knight trilogy Batman movies.  I personally love the ?0?1 at the end.
I dont think he will kill
Bro Best Reaction ever Batdown batman ! I hope Dcu and dc multiverso goes good and violence! Tks bro for the good time!
Why is his face so white at the end ?
I think that as this is a Batman earlier in his career, he doesn’t kill but is rather more reckless and brutal. I feel that it would serve an interesting arc as he is able to control his anger more as the film goes on.
I feel similar vibes I had for Joaquin Phoenix as Joker. He's going to kill this role. Definitely got the chops for it.
"Something about that punch" It's cause dude got his ass kicked to a rhythm.
I am watching The Guild on Netflix again and I saw you. I never realized you made an appearance on that show! That's so awesome!!
I know Batman doesn’t kill   But he totally killed that guy
Man he doesn't just punch him he's back fisted!
Battinson just perfect to play young Bruce Wayne! This movie has potential to be The Batman movie!
Damn.. Bruce really beat up the nostalgia critic... for his jokes on twilight, dnr, bvs and the bat credit card
I only just realized the trailer song is "Something In The Way" by Nirvana.
Dark, gritty and has same vibe of the movie "The Crow" especially theme music
Fun fact:  the scene where he’s beating that guy goes on for five full minutes.  It ends with batman covered in blood, picking the guy’s teeth out of his glove and the other gang members crying and screaming for him to stop.
I love how batman beat that thug to pulp
Collin Farrel looks unrecognizable as the Penguin!
Awesome 😎
The twilight guy made Batman look softer than a bag of Marshmallow 🤣
Which one of Batman’s unseen rogues would want to see in a movie?
First time on this channel, liked and subscribed instantly after the hat intro
The new Batman look reminds me of the Netflix Daredevil. And I mean that in a very positive way.
This is the kind of cinematography we were missing in a Batman movie
Why Bruce Wayne looks like The Crow?
Colin Ferrell totally blew by and I missed it
I'm watching all these reactions and yet i'm still looking at the trailer.. so good
People mocked Keaton before his first Batman trailer too.  It came out and *everyone* shut up. 😂
Hope this has elements of hush in it. Kind of feels like that’s what their going for.
It feels like Se7en with Brad Pitt
I think we all owe Robert an apology at this point.  Also this is the Riddler I have been waiting for!
Something in the way.🤘🏻🎱 I'm ready
I wasn’t worried about Pattinson. I’m old enough to remember when people were like, “Heath Ledger? The guy from Brokeback Mountain? Terrible choice!”
HUSH!
Nice hat, dude!
You liked that beat down a little TOO much...  ~_~
I think the duck tape guy is hush......... maybe.
They finally putting the respect on riddlers name
Well! I take back what I said about Robert Patterson - he pulled it off in the trailer
Still waiting for Man of Steel 2.
I have been waiting so long for a new Riddler i really want this to be good
That song by Nirvana playing is just *chef’s kiss*
Dangit, Andre! I was laughing so hard when you said: "Oh thank God, it's ove--NO! W-WAIT! WAIT!"   I freakin' lost it, man! LOL
I think its cool batman is working with the police, openly!
You sound like the Joker laughing. Its awesome
I hope this batman doesn't murder ppl
Batman punched that guy so hard he turned into mashed potatoes
Still not convinced on this sparkley Batman
*THIS* is the Batman we’ve needed!
Nah sorry not gonna ride the bandwagon  JUST because it's Pattinson. Movie not close to finish n he barely said a line which got yall soaking in your pants, but crying about the Christian Bale voice ???🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️ yea ok lol.
I think this movie is gonna a be like the joker in the sense of showing how mentally unhinged batman and his villains are. I think this movie will take film Batman to a new level.
We got another Penguin also, Colin Farrell. Try to find him in the trailer haha, he shows up for like 1 sec.
It looks really good
The way you said "That was amazing..." made it seem like you had an official nerdgasm. XD
I'm honestly wondering if they're going the "Children of Arkham" route.
Oh thank god it’s over...wait...no no no!!!!!
This is the first time I've been more excited for DC than Marvel!!!
I know this won't happen but imagine the movie opens up with Bruce having a night terror of his parents death and he wakes up and we see the full event in Bruce's mind later in the film and the killer is wearing a clown mask
He beat that guy like he was eating a two piece special with a biscuit...and forgot the drink.
Finally we get to hear what Batman's voice sounded like before it started getting raspy from screaming non-stop. ~
*if you are justice... please do not lie* Gives me chills every time
The villain is using duct tape. I'm calling it right now, the secret reveal will be that it's Red Green.
I’m so hyped for this movie
Finnaly a mystery movie for the detective character. It took 31 years, but we got it folks! Also why is no one talking about the thugs in joker make-up? Also, also, I think this bats doesn't kill but only 'cause he doesn't care for the extra effort and got better things to do lol.
I got hopes for this
OH SHIT! I was talking hella shit about “Edward from Twilight” being Batman, thought he was gone be soft.... I WAS WRONG AS SHIT!!! 😳😱😂😂🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 That was FIRE!!!
The punching scene tells me so much, it looks like he's out of control, but the way he says im vengeance shows that he's in complete control
Hey hope everyone is having a great blessed day. And have you accepted Christ as your Lord and Saviour Romans 10:9-13? Time is short. And check out James 3:10 as well.
Have you seen the silly putty joke made on top of that fighting scene?
Man i hope Doug  Walker is allright. Batman beat him up real good. :D
"If you are Justice Please do not lie What is the price For your blind eye" ....nice...
This looks really good, although affleck is still the best on screen batman weve scene, pattinson looks like hes gonna pull off the whole new to superhero shit
WHEN Batman beats up that dude, he's on the floor and when that guy thinks that Batman is done..OH GOD WAIT!!! NONONONO!!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
hahahahaha
I thought he was gonna say, I'm Batman.  I do like "I'm vengeance".
I love the Rivvler.
Ahhh,,, The Rise of the Rivler!  With the penchant for combining rivulets to form streams and rivers!
Was that Aaron Paul getting beaten to a pulp?
Him: that was amazing *hehehehehehehehHEhHEHEHEHEH*
2:27 that laugh got me 🤣
Wait no no !!! 😂😂😂 that killed me lol
I like the fact that they picked Robert Pattinson because he is so pale it adds the fact he only goes out during the night
I'm still getting Daredevil vibes I'm going to wait for the next trailer . Him beating up the guy is like the hallway beat down from DD
Micheal: I'm Batman Robert: I'm Vengeance     George: I'm nipples
I just started watching Westworld, so I was like, Gordon is an effing robot!
Pattinson looks like an interesting Batman but I'm still skeptical about his Bruce Wayne. Also, is riddler confirmed? I thought it was Hush
I wish ot was Hush, instead.
Ive been watching these Batman reactions just to see people say how amazing it is at the end.  the hype is real.
I always  said people  jump to conclusions before  seeing  anything. I had been on board  ever since  matt reeves was involved. Shame to say as a movie  buff i never  saw s7ven or taxi  driver  so thats on my to watch  list
That is amazing....reminded me a little of The Crow.
Glad to see this movie making good on what batman is supposed to be. The worlds greatest detective
I am vengeance, I am the night,  I am BATMAN!
I expected nothing and I ended up positively(and terrifyingly) surprised. Pattinson looks pissed off. After all the years of being made fun off of being in the Twilight movies he's filled with pure rage. Although there at times he reminds me of Jason Todd. Anyway I'm excited. Bring on the Bat Pattinson!
FINALLY the Black makeup around the eyes .
I hope we see Riddler in his green suit before the movie ends . Brutal Bat , I love it !!!
I don’t think this Batman kills as much as he is just new to the role. I’m not sure if it had been stated prior officially but Alfred  says that he’s become quite the celebrity implying that he hasn’t been Batman for long. I think that being new as Batman he is more brutal in the beginning and learns to temper him self better down the line. I think this movie will make it so that the movie develops his detective skills but also shapes who Batman grows to be.
That was Robert Pattinson beating the crap out of all naysayers of his casting in that Goon beatdown. I felt it Robert I felt that. Bravo!
That combo was badass, something the Nolan films lacked was good fighting.  Hyped to see the Riddler!
Netflix daredevil vibes.
I’m kinda sad because I was so hyped for this but now it looks like it’s gonna be rough for my anxiety. But I’m also pumped because WOW Colin Farrell as the Penguin looks AMAZING.
He straight-up looks scarier as Bruce Wayne than he does as Batman.
Mickey Mouse? 1:45
I wonder if Batman is going to spare that guy with half his face painted because he looks to be regretting joining the gang after seeing Batman beat up the guy. He seems to be a rookie compare to the others.
Loved your reactions !!awesome😀😁👍👍
I'm not to impressed 😐 😒
I *knew* Robert Pattinson was going to be a solid choice. Just hoping the actual movie lives up to this teaser.
2:28 2:50 You nailed a Mark Hamill Joker Laugh!
First time a Batman portrayal got me scared. This is gonna be epic
Nirvana was the perfect choice for this trailer.
Andre had the brightest version of this trailer lolol! Istg I didn’t see catwoman in there til now
Is it just me or that suit kinda ugly
I wasn't that impressed until I saw that beat down lol. Now I'm sold. Still not a fan of the suit though, definitely prefer the Batfleck suit.
That punch reminds me of the Hulk swinging Loki back in & forth in The Avengers.
So hyped!!!
Why does nobody ever notice Penguin?
Love your reaction to this, better than "other" youtubers lol.
Wish they would have cut his hair shorter. He looks like a vampire in a suit...Besides his Wayne look , the movie looks amazing
This trailer is so crazy hard it makes me wish that WB Games was releasing a full on, standalone Batman game. I NEED MY BATSY FIX! 😩 Oh well, I guess I’m going back to Arkham Knight.
Told my dad bout this and now he don’t wanna wait so long to see it
Riddler off the shits and Battinson came to scrap
"That was fun...!..well, not for that guy..." :-P
He got like a 12x Combo on that one dude 😂
Also Colin Farrell is completely unrecognizable
Wish Pattison's batman was Batman Beyond
nice seeing Carrell's penguin
“If you are justice,  Please do not lie,  What is the price  for your blind eye?" -The Riddler   "I'm Vengeance"  -The Batman (I love how the answer to the riddle the Riddler gave was also Batman's answer to the criminals he beat up)
I'm gonna say that he probably doesn't kill in this version, mainly because even though it sounds like he turned that guy's head into mush he still seemed to be talking directly to him when he said 'I'm vengeance', plus I doubt that the GCPD would work with him if he murdered people, and Matt Reeves clearly knows his Batman lore from what he's said in interviews so I doubt he'd have him be a killer since y'know, it's his one rule.
I love how this Batmobile has the "atomic engines to power, turbines to speed" aspect in a new look, and how it's an actual car again.
Y’know what that one beat down showed us that we’ve never seen in Batman before? Hate
Batman gave guy a 10 piece combo with a side of concrete. goddamnnnn
2020 Pattinson going back in time to visit Twilight Pattinson: Kid you're gonna be Batman someday   Twilight Pattinson: Holy shit I AM LEGEND!!!
I saw something like this in a animated movie
That had like Arkham city style of fighting 🧐
Dude can play Moonknight if he wants to. His Batman is on point
Can you please watch BNA (brand new animal) on Netflix and review it in your next newest video?   I think it would be really great.
Voice sounds better, doesn't sound like he is gargling rocks in his throat
Cool video!
This Batman is very British cus he slapped the goon twice and then went to punch maniac and I this was me thinking in my mind (Damn two slaps and Horahorahorahora punching , in conclusion I’m loving this already but will he do investigation like the detective he is)
I need to get me one of those hats
Looks awesome
Why is everyone's costume budget wafer thin? Also, why does it take "Batman" so many punches to take out that Joker leader?
Getting Batman Forever vibes
I swear this Riddler looks more like Hush...which they are the same person but still
If this movie goes well they should have Mr. Freeze as the next villain.
Say I glow in daylight one more time, motherf***er, I dare you!!! -Pattinson's Batman in a nutshell.
I just hope he doesnt kill and only injures them batman doesn't kill
Did you hear that there making a static movie ?
Are you going to react to the trailer to Wonder Woman 84
i am vengeance i am the night I... AM... BATMAN!
Isn’t penguin supposed to be in this also. Maybe a later trailer we will see him
I agree with practically every point you bring up in the vid
I'm guessing the Riddler is a cult leader... and is like the Wizard of Oz... nothing when no one is there. DANO is God.
Paul Dano is the PERFECT casting for Riddler.  Watch 'There Will Be Blood'.
Im so looking for this movie✊.
I’m vergerance
This actually looks really good. And the best trailer to come out of the other DC movies. I mean I was excited for Wonder Woman up until that Cheetah reveal.
2:50 @BlackNerdComedy has the Joker laugh lol
We will be getting another Penguin too in this film.
5:56 got me cracked up man💀
he beat the hell out that man 💀
If you are justice... *please do not llliiieee~*   The way that line was spoken gave me chills.
You have to be crazy to put on a costume with no super powers and fight criminals for justice. And that crazy hero is called BATMAN.
Before DC Fandome was streamed, I literally had no exceptions for any of their upcoming movies/shows/games, but I've been blown away by nearly everything
That trailer was trash.
why would the batman need to use that many punches on a clown like that? plus, it would have been more intimidating to that group if he'd go down with one solid punch. getting a weird beefed up tv show vibe from that trailer.
Wow. Just wrecked that dude. I love this.
OH.YES.
They did such a good job with Colin Farrell’s makeup as the Penguin. They show him standing up and shooting. He’s also the guy driving who says, “this guy’s crazy.”
To me Paul Dano creepy presence looms over the entire trailer and his two lines of dialogue and his tone are terrifying. He sounds absolutely unhinged. The line at the end "You`ll see" absolutely bone chilling. I expect awards.
At first I wasn't happy that they changed the ethnicity of Commissioner Gordon. I just thought it was pandering on the part of DC, but when I found out Jeffrey Wright was cast as the Commissioner I immediately got excited and understood that the casting wasn't just pandering. He is just so charming and charismatic in all his roles.
Okay, anyone reminded of Daredevil (also Marvel, please don’t let him go, it looks like you need him. Also Frank Castle.)
No one is talking about Colin Farrell in that Penguin make-up?
2:42 I was thinking that this movie will probably be weird, because honestly, Pattinson loves those type of projects. Seeing the teaser, it looks like he has two advantages: looking like a preppy rich kid and being the one guy that sees dressing as a bat, getting targeted by a serial killer and wailing on people and going “I’m game, are you?”
I like the new Batman movie Andre it looks savage
This is the scariest goodguy Batman imho
Nothing against Jeffery Wright, but why is it if a white actor gets cast as a known character of color it’s white washing, but it’s the roles are reversed it’s fine?  I mean I’m sure he’s going to do great, same as Michael Clark Duncan as KingPin, but it just seems odd to me.  Also it’s kinda odd they are changing Edward’s last name to Nash instead of Nigma....
I can’t believe they killed off Alfred.
That rocked!
Riddler and Joker are basically the same there is even  a comic run about how similar they are.
0:51 4:10 Anyone else caught that reference? ^^
I’m actually liking Pattinson’s performance but it feels like they’re trying the same shit they’ve been trying with Batman that keeps on failing and failing, with too much edge.
I doubt this Batman kills. (And he shouldn't) He's clearly working with the police in this trailer, no way Gordon would allow that
22.. 23 year old Bruce... give it up for Bob
I’ve seen this trailer numerous times today and I’m so so happy and in love with it. I can’t wait for the movie!
I'm down for Bob.  This will be epic... thank DC for listening
I still prefer Affleck. But I'm cautiously optimistic about this one.
It's the last punch of the initial flurry that really sells it, with the way he really follows through with it as the guy drops. It seems like they have a good fight choreographer.
Shit! That looks amazing! I cannot wait for this and TSS
this guy would love barry
Robert Pattinson is a really good actor !!!!!!!
Riddlers card has a cipher. Interesting touch. Definite Zodiac Killer vibes. The trailer looks pretty darn good. I wonder how the Penguin fits into the story.
I'm calling it now, the voice over is the tape guy and the tape guy is Hush.
Something really f-ing cool that I noticed is that in the first shot of Gordon coming to the crime scene, you can see the cops looking at the camera behind him with a little bit of shock and awe, so that’s batman walking in. I haven’t seen anyone mention that yet but I think it’s dope as hell
I'm not usually a fan of that actor, but ummmm I might be now
Not once, not twice, not three times, not 4 5 6 7 8 9 or 10 times. This Batman gotta punch 'em 12 DAMN TIMES.
Ya’ll legit need to see semz reaction
he used the combo meter before it went away
I dunno he looks more like a nightwing/red hood to me. But hey its a younger bruce wayne
Ppl who hates Rob as Batman is been punched like in that trailer by now 😂
Batman won't kill in this movie Matt Reeves has said this I think. Can't be to sure
The combat is giving me daredevil vibes so brutal 🦇
Man, this look EPIC ❤
Loved how they used nirvana’s something in the way Final song track 12 off the  Nevermind album of the original pressing . I’d go see it looks good & different
It’s the backhand in the middle of the sequence that has me rollin’. Cannot wait to get into this bad boy!
Suddenly all those bashers are becoming believers
You already know there will be vampire jokes also I thought they would be using scarecrow as the main villain this time would have been perfect since the Corona scare is going on
Pummeling that henchman made the whole trailer for me too.  Only takes a few moments to establish why this guy would legitimately be feared by the criminal world.  It's like watching a predator unleash on its prey and not even giving you a chance to process what just happened to you!
How long will it take for someone to overlay Batman '66 sound effects/graphics over that last part?
DC: We can't wait for fans to see the teaser for THE BATMAN. The Fans: THE EYE MAKEUP!!! HE HAS THE EYE MAKEUP!!!
”You’re a part of this too.” “How am I a part of this?” “You wouldn’t get it.”
I love how dark they went with this version of "The Batman". They clearly took inspiration from the "Joker" movie to craft this one. Although people tend to think Batman is benevolent and charitable, which he is. He does have a very dark side to him. Where he can push his code of not killing right to the edge and get away with it.
Great reaction. I'm definitely going to see the movie when it comes out.
it feel I want to play the batman Arkham series
Ya know, I know they said it’s not, but I can easily see this being young Batfleck
Every talks shit on bales batman voice, but don’t even realize In canon he’s a billionaire and is in the public eye. Anyone watching tv is gonna notice some dude in a batsuit sounds just like Bruce Wayne. Let alone he’s constantly working with police, like is thinking still a skill?
The thug that batman beat up   You are lying if you think it doesn’t look like Doug from nostalgia critic  It looks just like him  For a second I actually thought he was cast in the film  4:59
Batman's beating him like a drum, its almost like your hearing a beat for a song.
I'm going to wait for the first reviews, but... I might actually go see a DC movie this time. Always been an MCU devotee. Omg, that's kind of embarrassing. _Robert freaking Pattinson_ is going to be the reason I see a movie. 😳🤦‍♀️ And I don't even find him particularly attractive...
That's the type of action I wish the nolan movies had. I'm sorry but I cant watch those simply bc the action sequences are terrible
no more mister nice guy - batman
A teen vampire batman ?? Just no - no no no
That Nirvana sets the tone nicely
Man that rhyme is soooo good.... give me the chill  If you are justice please do not lies, what is the price for your blind eyes.
DC for life Batman forever
Do people really think just because Pattinson was in Twilight that he can’t be good? It’s been like ten years, he can improve. Plus he was good in Harry Potter when he was actually allowed to act and have emotions.
Looks dope, but they can't make a movie about someone else? DC have hella characters. Hollywood i guess.
I liked it the first 2 watches but now its kind of cringy it just feels too grounded now. He looks like nightwing not batman
Not doing a stupid voice is big Grayson energy just saying
"ohhh thank god its over...ohhhh no no noooo" 😂😂
He punched that dude like he was thinking about Twilight during that scene, lol.
I don't know if you know but the guy in the rain at 4:42 is Collin Farrell as the Penguin, he is just in a lot of prosthetics. He looks really good and I like that they made him not have like a really pointed nose and like unrealistic features but instead he just looks like a bigger guy with a bigger nose
you captured it perfectly, the "that was amazing" with your laugh was just pure hype aha. Spot on as usual !
I wasn't interested in anything else from DC Fandom but Black Adam....I just included The Batman (The Batman fighting style reminds me of the Netflix Daredevil...Brutal).
Patterson looks like Emo Peter Parker in Spider-Man 3
We need a new penguin, two face, Mr freeze. HIGH KEY WANT HUSH DOE 🤫
Your trailer reactions are always bomb
Damn this Batman has me hyped!😆 im just not going to be one of those people who shit on the previous Batman's like im seeing in some of the comments tho🙄 lol
I’m ready for this but I hope by next summer Ms.Rona is gone or we have a little bit of her. As much as I want to return to the movies I wouldn’t want to go in a mask 😂
Looking a little emo there Bats...
Best batman trailer ever. Love your reaction. Priceless
WAIT, THIS ISN'T BATWOMAN!
"He beat the CRAP out of that dude!" seriously, RPat don't mess around!
I thought the villain was Calendar Man?
they should've brought jim carrey back as creepy riddler
I wish they would make Batman fun and campy again instead of edgier and edgier.
I think it sucked , the bat mobile sucked it looks like a mad max car and Robert Paterson is not bulk up and his voice sucked as Batman!!
But can he safely operate a microwave oven?
As long as he doesn’t kill it’s an improvement
“I think this Batman kills, I think he does” had me dying lol
I still like the Batffleck, but I'm feeling very positive about the Battinson.
This Batman here seems to have enough of these Gotham weirdos...that he aint having no more of it. No more Mister nice guy. Lmao😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
He fights only one dude..🙄
This Batman trailer is giving me sorta like a Crow vibes. I dont know if thats a good thing.
It looks interesting. I've not seen anything Pattinson has done other tham the crappy Twilight films and the Harry Potter film. I'm gonna give him a chance.
See i knew to give Pattison a chance because everyone crapped on heath leadger for being in brokeback mountain and he surprised us all and i feel like Robert Pattinson is gonna do the same thing
At this point, I've seen enough batman movies for a lifetime. They have over-saturated the market with Batman properties.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Emo Batman?  With the mascara.  Just kidding it looks intriguing.
WB needs to make this as the first R-rated Batman movie!!! Need them more crazy beatings!😆😆🔥🔥🔥🦇🦇🦇
His “stuntman” beat the crap out of that dude. This isn’t John wick where Keanu actually pulls off the majority of these stunts and I think that’s why Pattinson wasn’t a good fit. People want to see actors fully embody the role, this looks like The Crow with a new age twist...not hyped.
The ? in the date make me laugh because in these times, that could mean they don't know what year it will come out in ;) lol
I’m begging it be rated R
I really hope Batman won’t kill in this
If he can do a good Bruce this will be amazing I pretty sold on his Batman
All i ever wanted was dark noir batman...now i get it
Just when you think it's enough your skull is bashed in.. classic
Cant we all appreciate this is the only Batman that kills with pleasure?
After watching this teaser, I have the sudden urge to listen to Nirvana non stop 🤷🏾‍♂️
Robert Pattison has definitely come a long way .
So the title animation was cool
First to get out a bomb reaction! Thanks brotha! Let's share this glory
Nirvana - Something in the Way  In case people didn’t know
🔥🔥🔥
I just realized that they recreated the opening of the animated series with the new batmobile.
Was that goon, who was punched by Batman, Doug Walker(nostalgia critic) ?
WOW!
It feels a lot like the Killing Joke. Looks like they're going to let him be a real detective this time. My favorite Riddler was the BAS take. He was classy, smart and a real threat; not just another version of Joker with a clue leaving gimmick.
That asswhippin is worth the price of admission alone 🤣
This trailer was all kinds of amazing. I got chills when the music was rising at 2:02 and the title came up. And MAAAAAAAN! Batman giving Goon number 12 those hands was a “holy crap” moment for sure. Don’t think he’ll be eating solid foods for awhile.    Side note: Did you notice the A turning into Bat ears at 2:08? That was cool. And again...That music!
11 punches and one arm break. WHAT THE HELL?!? YES!!! Looking forward to this one.
The Batman is blowing up the internet with goodness.  I can't wait to see this film 😍.  Welcome Battinison
I’ve watched him punch that guy so many times in the past hour lol same reaction Andre! I love it!!!
I really love the new design for the batmobile, it’s just practical enough to feel plausible, it kinda reminds me of Adam west’s bat mobile
The Q-Bert pop figure is staring into my soul. Also, I have to agree that the sequel to Se7en looks good.
"I think this batman kills" yehhh
Blackman?!?!
Honestly, Robert Pattinson is one ugly mother... that said it's a pretty excellent teaser.  I can get excited about this.  Honestly, the fact they tried to make every DC movie gritty is dumb, but it fits here so well that it feels naturaly.
I mean if Riddler is the main villain that hopefully means we will get more of a detective style batman
Meh.
This looks great and my problems are the batmobile looks bad and the cat woman suit also doesn’t look great
Clownface took a beatin lol
I want this song dude.
I hope Batman doesn’t straight up kill in this 🤭
ok i stand by that, and yeah ally concerns were thrown outta the window after he kicked that guy's ass and also you're right who ever doubted or still doubting Pattinson should just STFU at this point
I’m with you Andre I’m very excited about this and I didn’t pay no mind to all those people complaining about Robert Pattinson being Batman. I haven’t seen him in much but I think he is a good actor and he does a good job from what we see in this trailer so I’m definitely looking forward to this once it’s out because I been missing Batman in a solo film. All the recent films with Batman in them I enjoyed but sometimes it’s just nice to see Batman do what he does best by himself.
That my friends was Batmans voice
Tbh, and this is my opinion....  I do not like the cowl, I feel like the mouth part on the sides are too wide, I think they need to bring it about halfway to the mouth, and there's not much angry expression on the cowl, which I don't like, and I'm disliking his Batman voice, and it looks that cowl look like it came from a fan film spoof movie, and I feel like they can do even better with that Batman, than what they've got.   Just Saying!
"It's something about that punching" its cause he backhands him twice. I'd stay down after that 😂
His look put the "Goth" back in Gotham!!!!
I just want to know who the Riddler is going to team up with.
Idk the "riddler" in Gotham was p decent
Riddler voice is terrifying
the logo bit at the start already put me in a good mood 😂😂
HOW DID YOU GET THAT HAT????? and how can I get it??
I love how they made Batman more harsh and darker. Instead of those good two shoes comics
You know it’s a great trailer when Andre watches it twice 😊😂
Someone is OVERREACTING
That music... aren't those the first notes of Vader's theme?
How can I get that hat!?
I love that everyone has the same reaction when he beats the shit out of that guy trying to hit him, i love it hahaha
I love how easily people's opinions are swayed.  First people were confused about Bale's Batman, grew to love it People complained that Affleck's Batman would be lame, praised him for being the best part of both movies Whined that Pattinson couldn't live up to Batman's role, now are all totally down for his version. People, when will you learn, give something a chance before you rush to the internet to complain, only to change your minds the moment you see it?
05:56 Thank god it’s over..😂😂😂
This actually gives me some optimism. Looks like a step in the right direction for Batman. Here's hoping.
I wasnt really sold on Robert Pattinson being Batman. But watching the trailer now i am interested in watching this movie when they finish it!!
Do you not see what this is? This is the portrayal of batman as the joker story line. This is a film on it's own.
Ok I love it...but don’t this feel like the Telltale Batman Series....the look and the feel of this movie?
Not digging the Catwoman suit to be honest. Looks cheap. Trailer looks more like trailer for a CW series, so it’s a little underwhelming.
Omg! Robert Patterson beat that dude like he owe Bruce Wayne money!
This trailer alone makes the Nolan trilogy looks like sunshine & rainbows
You do Twilight to pay the bills. You do The Lighthouse for the craft.
Those 5 seconds of PatBat beating the shit out of that dude are better than anything BaleBat did in 3 movies. Yeah I said it! 😤😁
Imma eat my words. Patterson looks dope. This movie looks dope. The villain looks terrifying.
Awesome reaction! Keep it up. Subscribed from Nome Alaska USA.
Why’s Batman wasting so much energy on that one dude?! LOL
Is it just me or does anyone else feel that the Riddler's voice sounded so much like Tom Hardy's Bane.
I think Robert Pattison looks a little too emo as Bruce Wayne for my tastes.  That aside, this was a damn good trailer. The suit looked pretty cool . . . and the punch-punch-punch . . . punch-punch-punch scene was AWESOME!!!
We need another Riddler and another Penguin.
Does the the batsuit look like a cosplay to anyone else?
Wow this was great he’s good as Batman no lie
This DC Fandome is beating expectations
the reason why the date said “?0?1” is be cause the villian is the riddler. aka “?”
I knew Pattinson would kill this. People sleep on him but he isn’t that twilight vampire anymore.
I love how they embrace the eye liner
This Batman does not kill.
Andre! I want one of those hats man. Hook a brother up!!!
Theaters or VoD my body is ready.
When he was beating that dude I just thought of john campea saying hes not taking the role seriously lol.i like Pattinson as an actor but I didnt see him as batman but I love matt reeves so I had faith.
Andre laughing at another man's pain. Wait a minute, laughing, pain. OMG!!!!! ANDRE IS THE JOKER IN THIS SEPARATE UNIVERSE!!!!!😄😱
Where's the ref with the whistle?! That fight is over!
BUT WHO IS ALFRED?!!!
Andre: That was fun. Well...not for that guy. LOL Andre, you're a trip man.
I am Ba- I mean Vengeance, I'm still working on my name leave me alone!
Andre where’s the Suicide Squad game reaction?
Anyone else want to see a Robin?
Am I the only one who think the antagonist might be Hush, mostly because how his heads wrapped up
Batman did an ULTRAAAA COMBOOOO on that dude. lol
"We need another Riddler". Andre how could you forget Conan O'Brien in The Lego Batman Movie?
Pattinson only said two lines, but I'm already liking his take
Race changing characters still bugs me but that looks fantastic.
I've been ready for this since the costume reveal. I'm with you all the way that punching scene both in the "D*MN" sense and the "this is kinda silly in how brutal it is" way XD
Robert Pattinson is not batman, he is playing Bruce Wayne but not batman.
Was waiting for Andre's reaction to that beat down scene when I saw the original teaser.
Did you hear that there is a Static Shock movie in development?
I'm gonna give this a chance. I'm ignoring all the nitpicking and just accepting this is a different story,director etc.
1:41 mans just wanted to know who the batman was 😔
Oh great, now it's going to be even harder to find search results for 2004's The Batman
Creepy Riddler is definitely something I’m a fan of. I also love that they left the makeup around Bruce’s eyes after taking off the mask.
I'll be honest, I am genuinely sick and tired of the movies pushing Batman ever further into ultra-gritty/ultra-violent territory.  At this point, Batman is more like The Punisher.  Or Rorschach.   I really wish one of these reboots would take a step back, realize that Batman is now an emotionally-stunted psychopathic manchild who's at least as bad as the bad guys, and do something *different* with the character.  It's been over thirty years since The Dark Knight Returns.  It's time for a new take on Batman.
Batman meets Edward scissor hands meets the crow .., 💀🔥🔥🔥
I was thinking, with DC really pushing the multiverse all over their media now, what if this is the Grim Knight?
The suit reminds me of the games
I loved your reaction on the beat down scene
Tbh... this is the Batman I wanted in Batman V Superman
My face hurt after watching that goon get smacked to bits.  I don't think this Batman will kill, just leaves you crippled and disabled as hell.
Ok but Riddler from Gotham was really good too 😢
not The Riddler, its Hush
We've had   6 Live action Jokers 7 live action Catwomen 11 live action Batmen And now 4 live action Riddlers.
What's amazing is that they've only filmed around 25% of the film, this technically counts as a test footage and it looks freaking amazing.
Babe wake up... Andre just posted a new video
DC can't get their shit together, so here you go, ANOTHER Batman reboot. MEH.
I watched that punch scene about 10 times 🤣🤣🤣🔥🔥🔥
Andre has a hat..:-). Bats and his Doc Martens.
I love that as those punches go on it sounds like he’s punching a solid object to punching a bowl of mashed potatoes
So we totally need a Court of Owls movie and you end this with Matt Reeves Joker, which could be the best Joker yet.
I’m so giddy. This feels like such a cool Batman. He’s still new to it all but he’s got the basics down. He’s still got some humanity, but he’s also very broken and torn about what his place in Gotham needs to be.
1:49 kid has half his face painted, possible two face reference
is this going to be a rated r batman movie?
I had my doubts before this trailer, and I am so ready for this movie
1. I'm glad we're getting Detective Batman   2. The music has been great so far, very key to a great movie  3. Creepy Se7en vibes from Riddler works very well   4. Andy Serkis as Alfred is GENIUS   5. This may be my favorite Batman suit
After watching this trailer, I was wrong about Robert Pattinson. And boy I’m so down for this movie.
Best part of this reaction? Watching the trailer twice!!!
..............      Nananananananannaanananana BATMAN!!!!!
I’m ready for this movie. My only complaint with the trailer is he didn’t finish the line.
Love seen Andre nerd out.
-Burton: German expressionism - Schumacher: Dick Tracy-Adam West TV show -Nolan: 007-Michael Mann´s Heat -Reeves: Se7en-Zodiac
I'm hoping this will be a sorta cat-and-mouse chase between Batman and the Riddler
I can't stop laughing at the part where he beat the crap out of that guy.
Definitely the best trailer from DC Fandom and I am now excited to see Pattinson as Batman because he looks and sounds awesome.
Nice reaction Andre. The hat looks pretty cool too.
This looks so good!!!
This is sooo gritty.
Batman's back and he's pissed off.
