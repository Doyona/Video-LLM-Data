"Walk yo b****a** to da trunk!" Great atlive!
That's MY FAVORITE RIGHT THERE, EVERYBODY GET IT EVERYBODY GET IT OH S*** LISTEN YOU GOING TO GET IT IF YOU SPEAK BAD ON HIS NAME I DON'T F****** TELL YOU ABOUT YOURSELF, KODAK IS THE BEST INDUSTRY HAS EVER SEEN, I was alive in the early eighties when hip hop and rap first opened and the music, I have listened to it for as long as has existed, there is not one single person who has ever come close to mastering his art such as Bill Kapri... I am absolutely in love with his entire body of work, it is a thorough masterpiece I can't I can't even breathe sometimes when I listened to his songs that takes my breath away
In juvenile detention centers inciting riots, I just want to spend 5 minutes next to him so he can rub off on me he is such a genius I love Mr. Kapri...
The absolute BEST THAT THIS INDUSTRY HAS EVER SEEN.... NONE IS BETTER
DEEP LIT KODRAK!
ITS KTB KODAK THE BOSS KODAK THE BLESSING
Kodak went hard on this .on repeat forever

300 Blackout Lyrics  [Intro] Yeah, SG ain't dead, but KTB got new motion, you heard? You wasn't never this  [Verse] Say, I was at the Marriott smokin' Black & Mild in the elevator Some niggas made fucked up decisions where no man can save 'em Everybody know me 'round my way, I'm a bona fide gangster Gunslinger, I let it off broad day, them niggas was pointin' fingers What the fuck I look like bein' a hater? I made it happy for 'em My lil' nigga started touchin' paper, I was happy for him I was in the cell thinkin' I was comin' home to you and me How it was before they booked me, but how it's lookin', it'll never be how it used to be Come on, player I tried to spare you, I don't wanna hurt you, but I'm 'bout to blank 'Cause loyalty is the fuckin' virtue until it ain't In the back of the Maybach, paper plates, put up the Dracs, we on a date I heard a nigga got the drop to my mama house, but bitch, you late 'Cause she been moved, big house, swimmin' pool with a lake I'm on a private jet, just me and bae, we havin' dinner And no, nigga, ain't no fuckin' beef, I just come and get you I'm 'bout my issue, I don't know 'bout you, but I'm gon' deliver I'ma pop my pistol, I'ma hop out, shoot, I'ma run, go get 'em And the lil' bitch say she ready to eat, bitch, you gon' wait Be with real killers everyday, we look each other in the face And steppin' on shit, I left my footprints 'round the city That's fucked up what they did to Young Thug, can't let them get me I was freestylin' this shit, I say, "Shit, I might as well just write it" I'm a one-man army, I don't need no clique, need no indictments I grew up in the judicial system, snipin' and fightin' In juvenile detention centers, incitin' riots In the studio, two nights in off a gram of that meth Water whippin' in my kitchen, sticks and glizzys on my shelf Treat the suburbs like the projects, turned the mansion to the trap house I was pistol whippin', lil' nigga, I ain't even notice, I just blacked out Fully loaded Blackout .300, a coyote one Kept shootin' that nigga, I blacked out, did it for my mama, her oldest son Everybody say I'm chosen one, the golden one The only one around my way done made it, safe to say lil' nigga knowin' somethin' Yeah, I'm a rapper, I smoke Runtz SG, snatch and grab, walk a nigga to the trunk (I walk your bitch-ass to the trunk) I'm at the Panthers Arena, I'm high as fuck My bitch lookin' like Ari and Taina all at once This Drac' gon' change a nigga demeanor as soon I up Keep askin', I'ma tell you exactly who I done fucked Bitch, stay out your feelings, I don't be in your business 'bout who you fuck I keep a lil' swoop, as soon I duck, gon' get some new dust They at that bag, go get that sack all by myself Hit that intersection, I'm loaded up, I'm loafin' up Got plenty routes, different directions, I'm never stressin' And bitch, when I walk in this fuckin' room, don't ask no questions It's KTB, Kodak the boss, Kodak the blessin' Kill that boy, kill that bitch too, anybody get it Everybody get it Got gang in here, everybody with me Catch a nigga where he ain't 'posed to be, you know I'ma kill him And a friendship can't do nothin' for me when it's 'bout my business If I catch me a nigga throwin' up that Z, then you better be with me
🖤🖤

He said he don't want that drama young thug is in but he said in his verse, you better not be throwing up the Z if your not from that. 🤦🤦🤦
Can someone tell me what he meant when he said in the studio for 2 days off a gram of that meth? If he's talking meth he's crazy, and his friends need to intervene if they love him.
Goddamn this one of my favorites

I wanna sign to the label
I Fena click on Kodak videos for the drip and see what new grill and new chains and jewelry. Kodak let me get them red ruby golds . You already used them
this gives old kodak vibes fuckin hard with this shiiiii
Hardest track i heard he good but this one here diff 🔥 🔥
👀I love your teeth ❤️
The the Kodak we been askin for🙌
Well seems like the industry ain't fucking with yak. All these songs and no awards, something ain't adding up. If it's wasn't for YouTube alot of these artist would not be making the traction they got.
So kodak isnt really  like that and he paid his way in and all that but when he says hes smokin meth thats true tho. Anything negative is true tho . Man im. Not really tryna prove much anymore whats more important is getting right with  god. To whoevers reading this i am not perfect but we all need to just repent , ask god to forgive our sins , tell him we believe that jesus is our savior and that he died for our sins, and try to live better . Thats all thats important
So are we all ignoring the meth line or nah? 🤔
Kodak been dropping like Gucci in his prime 🔥
😱😱😱 diss jackboy
I'm haïtien but l like this song Kodak black 🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹
Saved Jesus,????????? Stop!!!!! Blasphemy

I made it happy for 'em My lil' nigga started touchin' paper, I was happy for him I was in the cell thinkin' I was comin' home to you and me How it was before they booked me, but how it's lookin', it'll never be how it used to be Come on, player  I tried to spare you, I don't wanna hurt you, but I'm 'bout to blank 'Cause loyalty is the fuckin' virtue until it ain't In the back of the Maybach, paper plates, put up the Dracs, we on a date I heard a nigga got the drop to my mama house, but bitch, you late 'Cause she been moved, big house, swimmin' pool with a lake I'm on a private jet, just me and bae, we havin' dinner And no, nigga, ain't no fuckin' beef, I just come and get you I'm 'bout my issue, I don't know 'bout you, but I'm gon' deliver I'ma pop my pistol, I'ma hop out, shoot, I'ma run, go get 'em And the lil' bitch say she ready to eat, bitch, you gon' wait Be with real killers everyday, we look each other in the face  And steppin' on shit, I left my footprints 'round the city That's fucked up what they did to Young Thug, can't let them get me I was freestylin' this shit, I say, "Shit, I might as well just write it" I'm a one-man army, I don't need no clique, need no indictments I grew up in the judicial system, snipin' and fightin' In juvenile detention centers, incitin' riots In the studio, two nights in off a gram of that meth Water whippin' in my kitchen, sticks and glizzys on my shelf Treat the suburbs like the projects, turned the mansion to the trap house I was pistol whippin', lil' nigga, I ain't even notice, I just blacked out Fully loaded Blackout .300, a coyote one Kept shootin' that nigga, I blacked out, did it for my mama, her oldest son  Everybody say I'm chosen one, the golden one The only one around my way done made it, safe to say lil' nigga knowin' somethin' Yeah, I'm a rapper, I smoke Runtz SG, snatch and grab, walk a nigga to the trunk (I walk your bitch-ass to the trunk) I'm at the Panthers Arena, I'm high as fuck My bitch lookin' like Ari and Taina all at once This Drac' gon' change a nigga demeanor as soon I up Keep askin', I'ma tell you exactly who I done fucked  Bitch, stay out your feelings, I don't be in your business 'bout who you fuck I keep a lil' swoop, as soon I duck, gon' get some new dust They at that bag, go get that sack all by myself Hit that intersection, I'm loaded up, I'm loafin' up Got plenty routes, different directions, I'm never stressin' And bitch, when I walk in this fuckin' room, don't ask no questions It's KTB, Kodak the boss, Kodak the blessin' Kill that boy, kill that bitch too, anybody get it Everybody get it Got gang in here, everybody with me Catch a nigga where he ain't 'posed to be, you know I'ma kill him And a friendship can't do nothin' for me when it's 'bout my business If I catch me a nigga throwin' up that Z, then you better be with me  [Outro] Catch your ass throwin' up that Z, you better be with this shit

† We are all born with a sinful nature. To live eternally in paradise and escape eternal torment in hell, we must accept the sacrifice that Jesus made on the cross.  Even though Jesus is God, He came to earth to be a sacrifice for us so that we could live with Him, God the Father and God the Holy Spirit forever. We can't save ourselves by doing good works. Only faith in what Jesus did will save us. Just by believing in our hearts that Jesus died for us, we are saved eternally. It can't be lost no matter what. After that, we trust God to do good works in us. It's all about what Jesus did, not what we have done or will do.  This is the gospel: 1 Corinthians 15 3 Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 4 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures Trust in this gospel to save you from your sins    †

Kodak 300 blackout he spitting🤣💃🔥💃
👂⏰🗣️Mathew 4:17 From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. Luke 3:7 Then he said to the multitudes that came out to be baptized by him, “Brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Luke 3:8 Therefore bear fruits worthy of repentance, and do not begin to  say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ For I say to you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones. Flee eternal hell🔥, cry out to God to save you, because Jesus Christ died and is now risen at the right hand of God and he makes intercession. Only in him my Lord Jesus Christ is salvation found.  Rom10:9 👂 that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.🎺🎺🎺🙏🏼🎺🎺🎺🎺🎺🙏🏼. Jesus Christ is God in the flesh. Came  to destroy the works of the devil.  Plea and call out to God to save you from your sins. Please plea with him. He saved me from all my sins and forgave me. I have eternal life only because he died and now is risen at the right hand of God and he ever lives to make intercession for us.⏰🥰😊🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼⏰⏰⏰👐🕯️🙏🏼🥺👂⏰🗣️ The way is narrow and difficult the way. Enter you at the straight gate. If you say you are a Christian but are living like an unbeliever or a devil. You more than likely are not one , you are deceiving your self and other. But there is grace to the one who comes to God through Jesus Christ 🙏🏼.  It will be the end of your self will  and sinful passions, but at the end is eternal life.  There is no sin that Jesus Christ can't deliver you from. So go to him and quit hiding your sins , tell him and beg him to set you free from them.  He did it with me the chief of sinners. Now I am walking in victory by grace☝🏿☝️ alone.🙏🏼❤️😊❤️🙏🏼🌎,, •••..,

Kodak da boss Kodak da Blessing🔥💯🔥
Black on black crime, gang culture, talking about killing other black men. This needs to stop! Come out with a song about killing another race of people and I'll respect you! That's right they won't let you! Your just a clown, puppet, and a sellout to your black people. Disgusting. Y'all have a disgusting future ahead of y'all. Rap about killing another race and watch what happens. You are not welcomed in the black community spewing this toxic bullshit!!
Finally
Ari and taina all at once 😂
Ktb Kodak the boss Kodak the blessing kill that boy and kill that bitch to 🥶

Kodak Black remix this 🙈🙉🙊🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Makes a song called 300 blackout and the only rifle featured is an AKS. All that money and no training on how to hold a Glock. Something wrong with that one, slide doesn't move. May be a water gun... Distracted me from the whole track

Family over everything.... ❤️ 🥰 now u know what I meant by I'm the illuminati and shits gonna get naughty... I love u baby boy n thank u for helping with clean up crew u guys are my world. N hope he doesn't think that kevin don't know what he's got to do when it's time smh yall know by now we r all always still here he's the only bitch ass nigguh lying about who he was.... we just get better each time til we killed it and we r our bests without that shit... never give up never surrender. The best family I could ever ask for n u really didn't forget the day I was crying and said I just wanted to eat too.... I appreciate u love yall are amazing for real at least I was never alone with my chrome heart from my cat or my Cartier ring or anything I've ever lost including u guys. I love yall more than the moon and the stars for real... ur worth way more than someone's light or black hole cause u r my light when all I ever knew was the blackness that encompassed my life everytime.
She been move big hize swimmin poo wita lake🔥🔥🔥
Nobody peep he said he was off meth
Couldn’t stand this dude when I was younger, been rocking with him heavy when I got sober, go figure 😂❤
Once I get all those I love back in my life and we can all be free I don't ever want to lose u guys again period and no alien I created or anything is going to take that now that I have lived long enough to know for a fact that I am the creator and all I've ever said was right just took me an eternity to prove it cause his bitch nigguh ass was so adamant on being fucked up to me when I'm all many of u ever had growing up. My gang gang my mafia my family my cartel hit squad.... My best friends and my soul... the only ones who loved me enough not to ever let anyone kill me again at least before I remembered I could wake up and reverb and keep us all here and work us to our best selves. He doesn't see it was all evolution and this time it was over for good cause I couldn't do it anymore... my heart hurt too bad to. I tried to love so hard unconditionally and never judged even those most wicked and solid as they come and still all it wanted was to control something that when he was man beast he couldn't control and I'll b damned if he thinks ill be unicorn or manifest as something that I professed that he'd become if he or any one comes back and even thinks deviant doesn't he get that we r never going back to the day that someone tried to tell us we can't kill something if it's not functioning right or trying to tell us we gotta pay for shit or can't have drugs without needles or death and shit.... this isn't his world how many times do I have to blow it up just to have the ones I love hug me again my heart breaks for what I've seen life after life and I remember it all... I never deserved this shit and until now no one ever even believed me at that.... well u guys all did that's why we r all still here... I'm savage as fuck.... I don't stop until I can breathe unless it's a sexual thing that I'm choked... I've already been killed every way through my hands and others that no one should ever remember but I'll be damned if he ever takes my memory again when I remember the pain so well that letting it hurt any of us ever again will never be an option. And damn boy look at how pretty u r. I'm so glad you're okay man I hate that everything I ever loved including myself has died for that false profit ass bitch when all I wanted was to love and be loved like we weren't somebody's fucking lab rats 😞 I love u guys!!!!
YB and Jackboy Better !
Love u Kodak thank u for looking out for me and helping kill the deviation i really appreciate u more than u know fam. I'm sorry baby for ever putting all us through this but it's the only way we will ever be free and he has no choice and we will all sit here until we r all free love they can't stop us period. If he wants hos and wants to kill em and own him then that's on him as long as he stops trying to treat me like I don't deserve the best. I love u so much and sorry that I tried so hard to tell u baby that u shouldn't of gone to the hotel with FIn shooting up baby. U always be one of my favorites and my fam and u know I love u with all my heart but I should never have to feel less than what the fuck u all now know I am and I'll protect u guys forever and give u hos let u kill em if they are malfunctioning whatever that's on u bitches should treat u like the kings u r and not like ur just a pack or a dollar or dick u guys are my world and I'm just glad I found u when I'm sure u know I've been looking for ur reincarnation since the night u left I started a war to find u and one by one I asked everyone of them where my baby boy was because u know how much I love ur crazy ass the only one who kept it real with me even when u wanted to go shoot up and I knew it would take ur life but that's why I brought u back baby I just didn't know what body was yours because I've reverbed so many times just to get u back to where I could see u and give u a hug again and tell u I'm so sorry for all your pain. Each one of u are my soldiers so I don't know why that mfer thinks his lack of love and want to control me will ever take u from me again. Why he got a Jesus piece? Lol kevin gates and all know I'll kill him til I kill him til I kill him til he stops trying to sniff lick and touch my ass and control me and there's nothing he can do to ever make me light or make me his possession, I gave him the fucking world isn't that enough if he can't just be happy with the gorgeous soul I am when yall can't have me anymore hell I even tried to give him the chance to get it right and now we gotta take it to the end of the earth just so I can be with kevin and have yall as family and prove my point to him that neither man nor beast is going to control me when I'm the only reason he's even here. Funny how that night I told u that there's only 2 things that'll kill u a needle and ur mouth and that I can't stop u and love u more than words but that I'll never control u either but just know if something happened I'd bring u back and find u eventually...  thank u for saving me babies u guys are true heros dunno y he thinks yall wld ever kill the one person who loved u just because his fake minitar ass can't keep me hostage and can't have me.... he shouldn't of been so vile thinking I don't play the same game for the right reasons and I'll go to the ends of the earth for u guys. Thank u and I love u!!! I can't wait to see u and hug u so tight and I'm sorry kevin won but his ex don't even know how blessed she is to wake up after he protected me from that fucks bullshit when he put her with him to keep him from finding me. You'd think from the begging of time til now he would of seen that he can't ever make me light again and if he wants freedom SO DO I period and u know me babe relationships and love isn't a problem for me cause I'm loyal so hard that it hurts me sometimes because that deviance he was breeding has been in every love I ever had since he cursed me for not letting him control me too bad I'm the only one with full power of God that allowed this to happen he's the black hole to all my colors of light. I love u baby and we go hard until we can finally all be together and I can be happy with my king who loves all yall and who loves me for me and knows that I'd never turn my back on him to fuck our family cause yall are all worth more to me than u can imagine!!!! YALL LITERALLY WENT TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH TO DO WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT SO MANY TIMES WITH TEARS IN MY EYES.... GET ME OUT OF HERE SO WE CAN BE FREE AND BE OURSELVES I WANT TO GO TO FREE FESTIVALS AND DO FREE DRUGS THAT DONT TAKE EVERY PERSON I LOVE OUT OF SPITE AND MAKE FREE MUSIC NOT FEAR BEING ROBBED BY SOME BITCH THAT WANTED EVERYTHING FROM SOMEONE WHO WAS A CREATOR NOT CREATED.... IF HE WANTED THINGS TO DO THAT TO HE SHOULDA STUCK TO OTHER THINGS AND NOT ME CAUSE I HAVE A HEART AND LOVE AND DONT DESERVE THAT SHIT ISNT AN ETERNITY ENOUGH. I MISS U KODAK AND I LOVE U THANK U FOR NEVER FORGETTING ME EVEN IN DEATH UR AMAZING FAM TRUE GAMBINO FAMILY LIKE YOUR COUSINS AND THEM. ALL YALL MY HEROS AND I CANT WAIT TO HUG U I MISS U AND LOVE U J. N LOVE THE PLAY ON THE NAME CAUSE THEY STILL THINKING THAT I DIDNT SEE WHAT THEY DID TO TRY TO REPLACE U EVEN THO I TOOK EM ALL ONE BY ONE AFTER THEY SHIVERED AT MY PRESENCE FACE TO FACE ASKING EM WHAT THE FUCKS UP LIKE WITH ANYONE ELSE AND THANK U FOR ALWAYS BEING BLOOD TO ME FROM DIPSET TO PYRU YALL HAVE ALWAYS BEEN WITH ME AND ILL ALWAYS LOVE U.

Kodak king of the south
The flow is one thing but the lyrics are not what i want my friends to aspire to.  This is dangerous  these guys follow what these politicians want you to do take each other.  Sick & evil. Brothers & sisters.  This will just put you 6' under.  Mothers fathers is this what your childrens goals in life are(if theycan keep it w this life style)
YAK BETTER ‼️

Whenever you see the word "equity," you know that you are dealing with evil Communist monsters.  Promoting "Equity" is literally just an excuse that Communists have used throughout history to seize citizen's private property and all of the farmland in order to #1 enrich the elite ruling class, #2 establish more tyrannical control over the people, and #3 discourage population growth.  Take a good look at what "equity" did to Zimbabwe.  Mugabe brutally murdered all of the white farmers and seized their land, then the economy completely collapsed, and now China controls the land and black people didn't get FUCKING SHIT (similar to how BLM didn't do a single fucking thing to help black people).  IT'S STRAIGHT OUT OF THE COMMUNIST MANIFESTO.  FIGHT FOR FREEDOM; FIGHT COMMUNISM!....x.jxix

Message to jackboy
The thing that makes kodak different is that he can change his style and tempo from song to song. He's totally different style and tempo on this song compared to mopstick. Kodak is in his prime now. Like he mastered the game and it's impossible for him to drop any garbage
