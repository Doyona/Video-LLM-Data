Who is the tuner
This may be unrelated but, Jesus is the way the truth and the life.
Rip to Tim’s son I’m glad he’s still keeping on with keeping on !💯
gay icon Westin Champlain
No name this car snot
Westin and Tim seriously connected here . Two straight up legends . Amazing
Man i know it was run ragged and resale aint really an option but why you gotta crush the SRT  FB Marketplace exists for a reason
Total price?
That’s an actual tip Wall Street racing or drag racing. All you have to do is juk your car to left or right without crossing the line and scare the other guy in the he’ll slow down, thinking you’ll cross only works if you’re in front of them first though
So I’m just seeing this video I’d like to know if you guys can do any truck I’d like to get it done
May you rest in pieces RIP SRT.
😮
I like how wind Westen is going to put two twin turbos on his Dodge Charger wide body Hellcat and it's going to make 1300 horsepower
I would have taking that shi don’t crunch it
Westen.... man... can you do something for ultimate redneck science... like the Cern super collider of redneck science.  I'm talking about an AWD, quad turbo, demon.
"so much torque the chassis twisted coming off the line"
Can I have this
@westernchamplin in process of trying to Ls swap a mustang with a v6 in it currently where would or could I find one
Don’t let GSP get this shit
no supercharge sound 😥
I wanna turbo my red eye
The youtube short I randomly saw brought me here and it definitely didn't disappoint.
Ahh reminds me of the hellion kit for the Terminator cobra
Goals man...this would be a dream
How many times did he say twin turbo 😂
crazy watching 2 years later noticing he was in my home town and having no idea
En boite mecanique 8 speed démarrage en deuxième 3em nos boum 4em arriver si greap 4wd de cherokee
That thing sounds pissed off
Tim is a beast just kept saying yeah we done
id sell both my kidney, my balls and some other things to have this
“Yea man I’m stock”
Absolutely amazing super fast car I love it.
So when you twin charge a car you dont hear the cool supper charger whine nomore?😢bummer and takes from the car
He told u how to cheat the race🤣🤣
Love the videos but my god the camera man needs to hold the camera a bit steadier
Awesome I want twins on a 3.6l 23  durango awd gt plus
It’s better than gta 5 bc it’s in real life lol
Make this Front wheel drive lol
My guy you are seriously one hell of achiever 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
I feel like this should be illegal
Bruhhhh why didn't you sell it
How much for it?
what a tune
Not a jet kid
awsome video westen thumbs up and shared
9:11 bro ¡ thought he added the sound effect
his laugh when he played  with nitrours botlle at the beginning
Wow ..! I wish Dodge would give me a Free Hellcat too..!
What did he mean by chopping the power out of it if it spins
That’s a fine car🗿
Me watching this video let him Cook
Don’t let it fall of the trailer “ oh shit”
I’m soon to be learning in automotive & can anyone answer my question of why is turbo under the car instead of somewhere or near around engine bay?
There needs to be a shirt that says “We’re on the dyno, Bitches!”
You let them CRUSH A HELLCAT?!?!?! Instead of giving it away??? I hope you rot in the deepest pits of hell
He just hit 3m
👀👀👀👍
God I want that charger !!!
its official twin turbo and a phatt 2.7 liter super charger=1200+ hp
Oh god if I could afford it I'd buy that Hellcat off you it's freakin beautiful
I love how he says they need to keep the supercharger then he says we are gonna turbo charge it
I love how when the car sparked at Tim and Westen, Tim moved away while Westen just cussed at it.
keep doing what youre doing.
W
10 bucks a gallon ? that's cheaper than normal gas here ... 1 gallon = 3.6 liter 3.6 liter of normal gas 12 euro ( wich is roughly the same as dollar )
Is it twin turbo and super charger? Insane build man
Twin turbos and a supercharger that’s amazing
https://youtube.com/@McWebby
9:15 it purrs
So amazing bro. It looks like you could brake time with that Beast Wild Long Boat.
👍🏁🏁👍👍🏁🏁🏁🏁🏁👍👍👍👍👍
My dream is to twin turbo mine too 😭
You’re not serious please somebody anybody any of you tell me please that Srt  Dodge charger was not going to be crushed in Detroit for real like that was a joke right like somebody just bought it and is enjoying it and take care of it like if somebody would ruin that car, I’m not even gonna watch his channel
For science🫡
Great to see someone doing the Dodge thing! I’m so tired of LS stuff I could hurl! Thank you redneck science master! Go out and boil some Hoosiers!!!
New subscriber 😂😂😂
I’ll pay 💰 you like 50k
Or put a dodge demon engine inside my Kia Optima 😂😂😂😂
Imma ship my car to you how much will you charge to twin turbo my 2015 Kia Optima 😂😂😂 I’m tired of all these fast chargers flying past me I’m ready to fly past them differently 😂
This video deserves more likes, views, and western needs more recommendation.
Thanks for the upgrade now it’s thousand horsepower American muscle V 10
how much does it cost to build all this
Whatever happened to the twin turbo police charger. I would love to have one
I was a bit touched by the tuner gentleman.  His son's birthday is the same as mine.
how bout you build a ultimate sleeper car
Why would they destroy the car? I’m confused?
Damn thing sounds like a 18 speed 😂 sounds wonderful
9:32 is when super saiyan mode kicks in. 🚀
Westen seems like a real stand up guy. Much respect for the guy
7 bucks a gallon is normal now lmao
Western as I’m from right by Freeport don’t call it Illinois call it illinoi cause I’ll get bulied here
Need to heat up tires
Need to heat up tires
"there's a turbo in this car, it's officially on there"  *bolt falls to the floor*
That’s awesome man
The only thing box is missing is the zip ties.
Found 1 of your vids 5 hours ago, 5 hours later I'm still watching them, They are awesome guys, Keep it up.
You could see that inner child come out once he heard the supercharger whine and turbo spool 💯 your videos are incredible!
Just put 17's on the rear with bead locks and keep the HP....
Im impressed with this talented man .
You are sitting and smiling now but you will cry later we will see my friend feel good big bro 🤟To  Westen Champlin´s BIG BROOTHER Trying to cheat people online FOR MONEY I have taken screen shots of it all my friend...I will send an email to YouTube immediately if others want to be interested my email address is here so I will send to you too
Why did they crush thr widebody ?
Playing real life forza
Quad turbo the hellcat instead
why are they crushing the other SRT?
4:42 if they end up crushing that car....I'm buying a battery powered Prius...because nothing matters anymore.
YOU DONT PRONOUNCE THE S, THE S IN ILLINOIS IN SILENT
Think I couldn't hear Victory by Two Steps From Hell?  Cuz I did.
Bro really went to my state to get it tuned I wish I saw this video before man
RACE IT WITH THE HOONIGANS PLS
John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life
You’re a fucking hero my man. Something about the supercharged hemi, it’s just fucking perfect.
I don’t know you guys but this is my new favorite channel
"Just don't let it fall off the trailer!"
Tim is like a hellcat wizard lol
Dude I want to come to work for you for parts for my car! I have over 40 years of experience as an aircraft mechanic but I am currently out of work, partly due to covid and partly due to a mysterious cluster of seizures I started having in 2012. Doctors can't find anything wrong but I keep having seizures! Luckily they only happen at night so I have been able to keep my drivers license and have been able to drive my baby, a 1972 Plymouth Road Runner/Satellite/GTX (it has parts from all three) just to get her on the road and drivable, just barely, on 35 MPH streets or the 27 year old cracked and weather checked Good Year Eagles on the back would probably explode at 55! But without a good paying job I can't pay all of my bills let alone afford parts for my car! I'm dead serious too, I will work for parts! I only have the weak 8-1/4" rear end, I have some NOS wheels I got a good deal on but can't afford $400-$500 tires for the back and I would like to supercharge her with the same 8-71 blower as you have, but for now tires and a rear end are the most important things. I actually live across town from Graveyard cars and have already tried hitting up Mark Worman for the same thing, but he is rude and narcicistic. Royal, Marks lifelong buddy, is a really nice guy and actually worked as a maintenence technition on all of the local school districts equipment.
How do the turbos work under the car, I thought they were to push more air into the car? But it looks like he is attaching to the exhaust, and yes I am not a mechanic or mechanically inclined.
This thing is a monster- oh we're not done. Classssssiccccc
in fashion it never starts first try
i love how the tuner gramp is like " we not done" when most of the time we have to tell them we aint done i love that passion and dedication for speed
man fr came to my home town lmaoooooo
7:56 that mural of his Son is Absolutely Beautiful there’s nothing more Gangsta than a Proud Dad they will love their child for eternity beyond life itself
No I just realized 12:08 I'm wearing an HP tuners T shirt right now watching this video. Don't be afraid to send a sick man more stuff!
supercharger+ twin turbos
Why do they have to crush all these Hellcats after they've had so much work done on them??
good job guys!
james jenkins
Feel bad for Barth, I couldn't imagine that! Ughh. I didn't expect to get slapped with feelings. T.T
bodykit?
"this things a monster" "yeah, were not done"  🤣
Vroooom stutututu
What was the cost and how long did it take to build?
Always strange seeing turbos near the ground but man ya gotta admire the heart, love from northern Illinois, the Midwest loves ya!…
Love the PASSION!
now I want to become a mechanic but I don't like math :( Puck.                                                                                                    I like this video by the way :)
I love how he calls it redneck science
this mofo out here not making cars look sick or drive like a dream. this mofo just makes car face their limits almost lmao. legend. i just saw ur 68' charger vid. did tater survive? imma look those vids after this one :D
I like the part were the car go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
Why did they crush the srt
Did they spray it white?
This guy is really  familiar with triple cheese burgers 🍔.  Does alot of talking  about 1000 horse power
Why are they crushing the bullhorn?
If it's $10 a gallon then that's $13.43 AUD and a gallon is 3.7 litres and in Australia we pay $2 a litre so that jet fuel is only double the price per litre than our normal fuel here in Australia so that jet fuel is cheap if your only racing
Do u think a scat pack motor and transmission will fit in a 02 chevy s10 lmao
You guys need a camera crew to catch everything would be awesome like plus a Netflix series
what turbos do y’all think he used? universals?
🔥
So it's twin charged?
song in video 9 minutes in ?
Who was tho old guy
lovin it ....
7 Dollar a galon, people in Germany paying 9 Dollars a Galon
Barth is a beast of a tuner. You picked the best
Voootoodootoodoomuuuggaaammma yes that is the sound of a happy westen
Just by the way that you are you lift my spirit to keep on going. Thanks alot bud.
How you get it for free
11$ a gallon? not bad considering 2022 gas prices
I came a lil @9:30
This man is actually autisticly smart with cars. Such knowledge 😵
11:52  your welcome :)
This man and WhistlinDiesel would make one hell of a duo
He sounds like markiplier except a car guy
$10  a gallon.... welcome to summer 2022
wait why would they crush the srt?
very nice brother
THAT MURAL!!!!
How u sleep?  like shit stare  laugh
Someone has to say this so I elect me.. There is only one Illinois the s is silent.  I can't believe nobody corrected you. 😁😁
How long did it take him to build it ?
how did his son die?
I can see you are a good teacher
I want to be part of your company 👍🇩🇪
I love how not serious these guys are. They have fueled my car obsession and I thank them for that, they build some of the the cars I can only dream about. Keep up the great work
U gotta go to hoonigan with this asap
im from chicago and its s is silent in Illinois btw lol
A twin turbo supercharged hellcat? Bro that’s a lion
9:56 🤤
Maybe I can start a channel, where I have no clue what I'm doing & pay a pro to fix it for me. Nice plan bro
I love your videos, started from the black 2016 Hellcat and now I’m hooked. Keep doing what you love bro 👌🏾  Edit: Dodge knew what they were doing when they sent you the prototype, they just didn’t want you to be great bro
Please don't music when you stututututu
Dude, you have awesome videos man!!!!!
Am I the only girl in the comments? I love these videos!!
The amount of knowledge this kid has is insane!!!!
woah! this is amazing!
I just came across your Chanel and I’m obsessed. You’re so funny and educational. Amazing content!! 🤍
7:54 , damn that was sad. RIP. send love to that man, he deserves it, cant be easy.
Dodge is smart to giving you that car. They get to right it Off on their Taxes as a Donation so it’s free for them and free advertising from all the videos you are/will making
i wish i had that "i play in the dirt" t shirt
Why did y'all have to crush the srt?
"were not done yet" i love that guy lol
You sir are living the dream.
Twin turbo is cool but it's like you forget the super is in there that bad boys twin charged (with a hint of siames twins)
Been Watching for awhile and you've done awesome ! Thanks man love the show
The thing is... Not sure if you realize just how expensive.. that little bit of time at Tim's shop was.... Thousands... Thousands
Wait... 1000 hp.. isn't 1300hp
Wait... 1000 hp.. isn't 1300hp
Was gonna say.. 18 lb is just beginning... Figured it would be about 30 lbs
Wait... How do you just get people to send you cars
What ever happened to the white charger... Cop car...  With the twin turbo...
whats the song at 2:30?
why is the other charging going to be crushed?
so this thing is twin-charged? or did you guys kinda just unhook the supercharger?
like and sub
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
🛻🛻🔥
He really said “iT aiNt gOT No GaS”
4:58 he Said Detroit so funny 😭😭
How hot does the cabin of that car get?  I bet it's an oven.  I'm assuming you wrapped those pipes later?
That ain't no hellcat that's a wildebeest
Did they really crush the srt? Can someone tell me why?
Yall gotta open that garage up no cap
Dude! I'm from Freeport! That city sucks.
“Let’s get to illinoi”s” 😂
I live so close to there 😂
I Love Mopar 😍😍😍😍😍😎
And this is why dodge is best 😎
This vs Hoonicorn asap
Better put some real rubber on there or you are left with a bunch of useless unusable power!
Its not only me or the charger looks like the man face of roblox?
This is some Forza Customization right here.
Dude I’m speechless for this car wow
I want to see you race demonology
if you don’t send me this hell cat your not a real one🥲
Turbo: wooooo-de-de-de-de Supercharger: veeeeeeEEEE Turbo-Super-Charger:  Heaven
It's so awesome when morons are given lots of money and machines to play with!
So how come the cat was crushed?
The part where he says stick my finger in it had me laughing so hard
Can you build my charger 392 lol car is amazing you guys are awesome
7:20  That Green Hellcat reminded me of Gavin's from itsjusta6
Automatic like and subscribe! 👌🏼👌🏼
Wait I missed it, why is the srt Charger getting crushed in Detroit? 😭
Enjoyed the video super dope
DUDE the dyno testing blew my ears out😭🤣I have headphones in
This man is living in forza horizon 5
i dare ya to race it against the hoonicorn in this season
That sound is music to my ears very nice
I admire people who can open a turbo kit and not even look stressed. This dude just casually knows every single part and what he needs to do with it. Good for you brotha
Bumptydee boo
Lol 😂 LOVE IT !!
Where's the Peterbilt 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
12:00 imagine asking to drive your own car 💀 "wait, i get to drive it?"
If someone really fu..k the cars engines then here is this guy🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Twin charged puts this car in a very exclusive club. Big thumb's up for Tim, that man is a living legend and a national treasure!
I love how you personify your car and car parts!
Y’all need to face hoonicorn
What?!?  They are crushing the car? Why?  Hope that was a joke
So it’s running on twin turbos and a supercharger?
Those turbos are gonna be crying when theres a bump in the road
build me something im itching to get behind the wheel of something insane
LOL damn i like this fat kid talkin🤣🤣🤣
first time viewer here and 40 seconds into the video i subbed. nice shit!
What happened to the cop car
This guy is crazy and funny😂
What a beast
Damn this car is fast
Did they really crush it man I would of loved it
I would definitely have a supercharger over turbo any day. Too much heat and turbo lag. Paxton supercharger would last a lot longer and doesn't compress an over amount of heat under the hood. Belt drive any day. BullyBilly.
Wow, that Tim Barth guy is a legend. What an honor it would be having him work on your Mopar.
Yea officer…it’s stalk
boost takes two to three business days to reach engine
Vacuum doesnt leak it sucks, that is a dream car right there ! I'd rear seat delete it  pop a roll cage in and be tuning the chassis to take the power a bit better
I live 15min from there
I honestly have no words... holy schnikey.
Very much better if flying tigers graphics applied in front of this car, with lil inclination to high in back (dont worry if part of that bited by front wheel compartment) and.. a lil percent reduction in dimensions oc
Westen is giving me mad scientist vibes
If you inhale "NOS" it will give you a lot of laughter.... Until you inhale too much and you can fall asleep.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-3TsDKSJTU&t=629s
Sounds like a desil when you had the vacuum Leak
crazy!
i love how it has that low whine to it and can you pls do a update on the 379 pls
dude im 20 min from Freeport in rokford il. good shit
what year is the hellcat
Just found your channel from the blown tater vid, got me hooked lmao
Unbelievable.
Whot a legend
We got a new truck!     And we gonna twin turbo it!  Man i love this guy
Just came across this channel. By the gods how this captures the absolute madness, frustrations and the final euphoria that it is to build a car. :D
Such a shame that juggalo is going to miss the festival :(
i live in freeport.  i remember seeing the car on the trailer.  sucks i didnt know it was YOU!  lol
MPG?
First time watching this fellow maniac ginger, but i had a smile through the whole video. Subbed
Love the 80's throwback music
Wait…….that’s illegal
that's fucken sick
My fav car😏
Dudddee that's crazy😂😂
Should race hoonicorn!
SuperTurbo! But it's not a Nissan.
wait free hell cat ??????😩
I Love How Unconventional/Conventional This Channel Is And How Much Fun And Love He Puts Into These Builds 🔥🙏🏽
Why crush it, broke my heart 😭💔
the turbo needs time to kick in
That's a nice compound system
anyone know the song at 0:46?
What happened to the SRT?
The TRX tho
“Hims a good boy, he make enough powa to blow tha head gasket”
Tim Barth is one of the sweetest most caring people I know! He is also a mad scientist when it comes to tuning cars! He tunes my demon and does a fantastic job at that!!
I wish I had a dodge 😮‍💨
Instead of Twin Turbos.... QUAD TURBOS!
dodge gave you a hellcat thats sick
Why did they crush it?
he said 100 and it still sideways no way
"You ain't got boost till it takes up your passenger seat"
Mans went screw it and kept a supercharger in there and then put freakin TWIN TURBOS in a hellcat. What a mad man.
I call it the turbonator
Can you give us the all around amount you paid for everything?
I’m in love with that car
The constant... CONSTANT narration, noises, and overactions from boogie with a beard made this difficult to watch
Now make it awd
Do it with a redeye
why twin turbo? you should go bugatti level on the turbos, Quadturbo baby!!!!
I have to admit I'm more of Italian whips. Rarris, mases and Porsche's
Holy mother, I just figured the other day that you can  actually have a supercharger and turbocharger combined insanity has a new level
It's that ah hellkitty
You need to run this against the hoonicorn
with the supercharher nd turbos , car be like weeee weeee pstspstfu
Twin turbo a supercharged hellcat??? That's like adding 2 50 cal rifles to an M60
that hellcat you have is crazy i want to do something like that later on but that would be cool if u could help me one day
8 13 is my birthday at 7.59
Why crush it 🥲wen u can give it away 😩
Jesus Christ Mopar ftw torque and fuck you at the end
I heard illinois and about lost my shit realizing how close you are probably to me xD IT SOUNDS LIKE A ANGRY LION OH MY GOD !!!!
I wonder if the Pistons can hold up to that much horsepower
🔥
I didn't know that the a moana song was playing in a background tab and so i was just listening to it thinking was part of the video
Put 2 more turbos on the car
That motor picked the whole building up as he gives it more gas. Nasty
I would love to see what Wes could do with my 75 chevelle malibu. You somehow made a hellcat even better!
Ok so since I new to your channel I starting to think that twin turbo is your favorite
Cool
The sound of twin turbos combined with a supercharger is absolutely insane
That's awesome 👌 the tuner seemed like a top bloke 👏
Dude all i have to say is you rock, just bumped into your channel, i love it
Damn that sounds sexy with the turbos
Time to do some catching up. Last time I watched your videos was when you was sending the other hellcat back. The one tuning it, I like his attitude. Famous words. We're not done.
Holy FUCK!!!
Top end sounds fucked already
Send me a Doug Hellcat car🦦💔🇸🇦
Good bye SRT
poor fan
Illinois with no S sir lol
HOW MUCH FOR IT
Why doesn't Dodge offer this as an option on the Hellcats or the demon.  It should be a dealer option possibly but it's just fucking cool.
Something tells me that this car isn’t naturally aspirated but I don’t know what :P
I HATE ITTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT I LOVE ITTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
Turbo under the car?????? WHAAAAA never seeen this b4
How am I now just seeing this & how am I barely realizing you can do both 😭😭🥲
Swaf
so its turboed nd super charged
Yessssssss!
This is a sick built
Why crush the srt such a waste of money
Both the wheeeeeeeee and the stutututu in one? My god..
Just so you know I’m currently on my way to buying twin turbos for my camaro 2ss JUST BECAUSE OF YOUR VID
Damn rip to his son that was Killed 7 years ago sorry to hear about that .
It sounds like a semi truck with turbo
Put this build in the new forza horizon 🔥🔥🔥
Let me have this Hellcat. I need one. Wait nvm this car broke down on video. Fiat-Mopar-Chrysler-Jeep-Dodge is complete trash.
The classic hemi tick lmao 🤣
Why did the SRT get crushed?
Lol this old head said you couldnt twin turbo a hellcat like when they came out i was like 15 he was like 35 dumb ass
Can you imagine seeing a hellcat on the freeway and thinking "easy gap" and then it has over 1000 whp 😂😂
Under the car though??? Seems sketchy
Never been so entertained from a car video
8:28 thought he was talkin to me😭
wait why is the srt charger getting crushed 😭
Just moved to Illinois two months ago and honestly didn’t realize how close y’all were until now😂
I would have taken some parts of if the other hell cat !!
Dude when you started reving the hell cat there was lightning that hit the ground where I live and it shock like it was the car
why would the crush such a car?
So you came threw kc
It's amazing how many views all your videos get. You're videos are fun to watch. So cool that the turbos are under the car.
''I get to drive it?'' me asff when my sister lets me drive her rt lmaoooo
this guy who tuned it is legit as hell
When I tell you this guy is awesome, believe me… don’t know him in person, but he displays energy thas great for a team Captain. Whoever rolls wit this great Caucasian, consider yourself blessed ✊🏾🥲
Sounds like a batmobile
9:21 that sounded scary
Why did they crush the old hellcat
This dude gosh. It’s making 940 to the wheels “yeah we’re just getting started” ah hell
Such a sick car!!! I’m not a fan of dodge but I’d take this any day!
i'm sorry, but i cringed when he pronounced illinois like that
HP Tuners is legit
oft...he said Freeport, IL I have zero good stories there xD.
Anyone else notice @ 2:34 when he says “there’s a turbo officially on the car” then the bolts fell out onto the ground 😂
“That is gonna be sweet! That’s gonna be awesome” I think you’re right haha
@westenchamplin why are they crushing the first hellcat?
Be honest Westin, what’s the mpg after that
was that 24 psi of boost inside the charge tube or in the blower?
wow
Man now i need to know that song 45 seconds in! Lol. We definitely need a song list on here.
DUDE I HAVE CAR PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN FREEPORT. REALLY GOOD FRIENDS OF MY DAD.
How does a muffler delete sound like on a hell cat
In the merch store, Hellcat exclusive WCTT kit. Max out your local Dyno today!
I’ve never wanted someone to be my neighbor, but at the same time would hate to have as a neighbor so bad
Wait so did it make 1300hp? Because he said it hit 1004. Which is why I ask where did that extra 300 come from
Man, this is my first time watching one of your videos and you look like a such ass nice guy. 👍 great content.
Bro don’t crunch the set send it to me
This is amazing content/editing 🔥🔥
@dannyduncan
Buy a school bus and put a 24v in it!
Just needs a big cam
Jesus that thing sounds freaking nasty, LOVE IT
Why did you have to give the bull horns away 😢
How much boost was he pushing ?
U said they were gonna crush the srt ????
Bro sell shirts that say redneck science on your description and thank me later
What if you also nitrous it 😳
T h e s o u n d o f  m y p e o p l e
😍😍😍
2:03 eargasm hahaha
Wanna trade for my 2009 Silverado extended cab? No low ballers Ik what I got, minor rust.
What injectors you using
Pretty rad if you ask me 🤟🏽
Poor charger, why did it have to be crushed?
Boyssss we making history
imagine a hellephant with twin turbos
Can you sell me your muffler set up off the hellcat 😭😭😭
That moter tho 😵‍💫
I want one
This might sound like a dumb question but can you legally drive that on the street?
Car porn!!!
What's a redneck
Why would they crush the car
We going let it cool down
Oviously he needed a tune
Come check out  Beam Street Business if you like Fast ass STREET Cars. The Channel is a movement. We in the trenches for right now. But we grinding daily. #WeOutside
Yes
That’s a charger not a hellcat
Thanks for the video, I'm about to have my Charger Hellcat installed the twin turbo system too ^^
I actually live right next to Freeport illionis freeport mine bad place I'm kinda surprised his car didnt get robbed
Why are they crushing the rt
that sounds so good it giving me a Bonner
That is a awesome build.  The sound is like nothing else.  A guy I knew made 800hp in his foxbody turbo... its crazy power when those turbos spool up on a v8.
still lost to tavarish
The car community online is some next level shit. This build was done 3 weeks ago and already has 1.4mil views...
Hes a genius.
my dad said if you sell it how much will you wont for it
Barth is the fucking man definitely taking my build to him
Idk how I clicked one video n ended up here but thank u YouTube lol cuz I went back to the one I clicked on n man was it BORING….
Barth a legend
Where’s the 4x4 hellcat
Go go go! Another fine job. Now on to the race. Have fun. God Bless.
August 13 or 8-13 is my birthday.  Sorry for your loss brother
It’s should be canmmed too
Wth you where in my cityyyy
Like for the music
i came a little seeing this in my recommended, just thought i'd share.
Never seen you look so happy brilliant absolute brilliant 👏  👌 best channel out there by far the views you're videos get say it all well done
I just want to take a minute to appreciate the editor who decided to include Two Steps From Hell's "Victory" in the background music for this video. Amazing song and a perfect choice.
Living proof Gingers have a Soul..FU South park...Double Dog Dare you to Race Westin Champlin.
rip srt
1300 hp hellcat redeye vs 1000 hp Tesla plaid????😳😳😳😳😳
Those dyno pulls!
So this is officially your car now or dodge just let u borrow it because this would be a cool road trip car just put everything back and then road trip
Wth I wish I saw this earlier I woulda let you sleep at my house lmao you were right by the sos

The amount of work that went into this is absolutely INSANE
I Love his dude he is my people

Mega power for 2 year  And engine Transmission gone  Dodge make 707 hp  dont touch anything brother
Just gotta fine that sweet spot in each car
When is race?
Freeport IL. I think that's the most publicity my hometown has ever gotten since the Boxer Gerald McClellan
9:20 funee part
Compound boost (turbo and supercharged ) is slower than turbos only. Great content tho.
Sick hell cat
😩😩
So basically je just twin turbo a supercharged hemi hmmm great! 🙂
“I don’t even see any zip ties “ 😂😂😂
Can't beat ole fireball Urist. He cut his teeth in 10 inch tire world.  Best turbo kits out there
''nitrous is boring'' -western champlin
I legit saw you on tiktok then you pop up on youtube
The spurious sharon morphometrically zip because rooster embryologically tire near a  frequent relative. dazzling, roasted quit
God I love the sound of this car!
TTTO TWIN TURBOS TECHNICALLY ON
Hellcat said weeeeeee then it said stututu
Twin turbo diesel mustang then twin turbo supercharger hellcat NEXT on Westons channel twin turbo Tesla
Typical dodge always have the hood up.
Twin charged
That tuner guy is so cool
Dude ur funny lol
MORE POWER BABYY
You love kids speak to the police
Dudes son and I have the same birthday...
Why was the other srt getting crushed?
Supercharged turbocharged?
What did I miss... 1004 is not 1300!!!! Even if your using crank horsepower which is lame the tuner said they make 630-640 on his Dyno that's a 9.5 to 11% loss which only gives you 1119 so still nowhere near 1300
Hey what do you do with all the cars you modify do you sell em off or u keep em all?? Cuz if you holding an auction  ima needa knoe details
That thing SOUNDS violent
Would you sell a car?
Just turned 22 and Jesus that kids death hits close to home
9:21 mean ass start
This shit crazy my Boy I’m talking Bat shit Crazy 🔥🔥🔥🔥
*gets badass turbo kit*  “WE GOT TAGS!!!!!!!”
So are we ever gonna see what ya did at the event ? Where ya been man ? ;)
I need a Renault Clio with a Hellcat engine please and thank you
take this to the hoonigan this vs that series
Hey
RIP headphone users
Is it ok if use 5W-40 oil instead of 15W-40
8:26 I felt that  Wassup wes
I can finally rest in piece knowing they twincharged a Hellcat
He nonchalantly got 1 of his hellcats crushed😂
He said we not done 😩my favorite words
That’s wild
do a supra
What is the cost of the parts what you put it  on
Man, I love a fat dude.
it sounds like shit, cus no exhaust? sounds like a lifter tick lol
Were you guys in Washington/Maryland if u were I think I saw y’all at nighttime
Westen over here casually blowing off enough nitrous in his shop to fund most of my current projects
Right around the corner is who I work for, I was wondering who put the marks on the road, wish I could have rolled by as you guys were driving it, that would have been awesome to see
HOW MUCH FOR MODS AND INSTALLATION???  I want same build
Super chargerd and twin turbo yes that’s cool asf
Freeport, IL is only and hour 15 minutes from  where I live!  I bet that was quite the haul for you wasn't it?
Soooo um no one is gonna say anything about the s in Illinois is silent.
Taking apart a supercharged engine to make a twin turbo indicates failure. youTube is full of idiots.
For the love of God sell me the camo burn out edition charger before they crush it, it’s just not right!!!
If you like that video, you'll love this one.  @
Damn rip your son we got the same birthday 🎂
That shit sound nice asf🔥🔥 sheesh
Great job car shop dudes that know what they are doing and having fun with it, are what keeps me tuned in
i cant hear out of my left ear anymore but its worth it
Bruh why twins and a charger when you couldve gotten that power with one or the other? Crank that power way up  if your going to do both i.e. 2500hp, be a man. Crank the boost up
The wistful size pertinently apologise because turtle usually smash versus a  fresh hardware. handsome, itchy vault
I love this video 😂
Why did the charger have to go??
rip that bullhorn hellcat
When will they start putting these on the streets? I would love one .
That thing sounds like a TT Viper 👀
Fuckk i love this channel yall do it fucking right plus the way yall are genuine
all fun and games till you hit a puddle the turbos gonna fucking die
what a fuxken build
Does anyone know exactly what makes turbos have the sound like at 11:40 ? Wanna make me twin turbo car have that sound
How much does this build cost total??
Time for some eagles!!😁✌🏽
Hopefully we can see that charger soon that ya picked up
Literally the ending is the best. “Don’t let it fall off the truck” “oh shit” *cuts video
Freeport IL? Nicceeee
The turbos feeding the supercharger should of come from factory like that
Forced induction is gangbanging that hemi.
Would this make it a hellcat super turbo?
So how much are you going to advertise to do this to other people's cars. I'm sure someone will pay
Alright, so since you got what 2-3 hemis now, I know you got a set of hemi main studs you could sell me.😂😂
Found this video that’s supposed to make you scat’s launch time extremely fast here’s the link I see somebody try it  https://youtu.be/0E3kcqiQ46U
Super and turbo charged??? Rods to the moon baby
So it’s twin super turbo charged? Whaaaaaaa?
When I doubt slap a couple turbskies on it
Y crush the hellcat jus give it to me🤦🏾‍♂️
And I’m excited about getting my caddy van remapped to 190bhp lol
Oh wow that's kinda cool. I grew up in Monroe, WI like 20 miles north of Freeport, IL. Freeport kind of a shit strait shithole though.. Lotta trashy people & heroin there for being such a small little town..    How crazy he can tune a car from like anywhere in the planet?! Can just send it over too you to upload to your car.. That's wild..
This just shows the amount of time and engineering that has went into the 6.2L hemi. You’re throwing about 1100 hp to stock internals, stock blower, stock heads, etc and it’s handled it flawlessly, plus I saw this car in person go down Woodward and you couldn’t get traction for shit hahaha truly amazing what dodge has achieved
Where is this jet that you keep referring to
Like mustang shirt
That thing sounds so freaking mean! Awesome! How close or over the budget that dodge set did you go? 🤔  freaking insane!
Gives me goosebumps listening to it scream
It's so perfect
Tune
The statuesque kitchen socioeconomically carve because chronometer hopefully live per a simplistic pharmacist. wasteful, daily astronomy
It’s probably the alternator
Why are they crushing it?
It's weird for them to mount under the car
That guy is a badass! Glad you met up with him. Nice blanket too!
In the sense of “leaving the stock motor” are you allowed to port the blower? More space for air means higher MAD
Quad turbo?
I just found this channel and I already love this guy he’s fun to watch!
Just a fyi a demon is my dream car
This is my dream car😍
Can’t believe you came to Freeport Illinois I wish I would’ve known you were in town I would’ve came down to see you man
they always say *nice hemi bro*
Dope intro !!!
Why would they crush the wide body???? I need answers ASAP
Just don't let it fall off the trailer...  Oh shit LMAOOOOO 🤣
how was his 21 year old son killed though
Me: Starts video.  You: What can we do to this supercharged Hellcat? Me: Twin turbo.  You: Twin turbo.  Me:🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤 👍🏾sub
My condolences Barth
Why not more turbos 12 or something
Turbo +súper charger?
They crushed a perfectly fine SRT?
there is a volkswagen that use supercharger and turbo at the same time  to compensate the lag
GOD AND JESUS BLESS YOU ALL IN JESUS MIGHTY AND POWERFUL NAME WE PRAY AMEN 🙏❤️
Whats the shops name ? In Fremont IL ?
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
That coffee holding gentle man is a genius!!!
That was sick
I didn’t even know you could slap turbo with a supercharger lmao that’s AWESOME!!!
Errbody uses nitrous... so turbo a supercharged car.  Lol let's go!
Y’all should widebody it next
10 lbs boost, 9 seconds of fuel, 8 roaring pistons,7 second quarter miles,6 sick burnouts,5 big dudes, 4 roasted tires,3 gallons oil, 2 spoolin turbos, 1 supercharger in a pear tree!
That boy tearing up them roads right about now
Sickkkkk
Dude, you hacked up your car! I'm glad he fixed it for you.
We supercharged a turbocharged 5.9 Cummins, what a blast to drive.
They’re gonna do what to that dodge?
Weston when you stopped in Freeport illinois, That’s my home town, it’s a shitty little town
Love this guy’s energy 👍
Should give it away!!
the exact car that i want
https://youtube.com/user/ThaBoss1084
make it all-wheel drive not sure if its possible
i’m convinced they only know how to do weird shit
Sounds great 👍
Thatdudeinblue will salivate over hearing this car!
Cum-stang
this vid earned my sub
1300? all i saw was 1k
First started up on the dunk she sounded like a monster ❤️
Who thinks he should make a shirt or hoodie whatever that says, “redneck science” with two turbos on the back
Great vid! Wish i had a hellkeezy to turbo lmao
Damn this is my first video I’m late to the party but definitely subbed your content is awesome💪
Is the supercharger still on
Bro wdym they’re CRUSHING the first hellcat with the horns and camo!! They can drop that shit off @ my crib if they don’t want it! 😭😭😭😭
Love this guy, honest natural and fun
WHY ARE YOU FOLLOWING MIA KALIFA ON INSTA
One of coolest videos I’ve seen a min.
weight reduction doesn't even matter at this point
Sad they crushed it. What waste.
Another day another banger viral video let's gogogogoo
a(n) question aren't you suppose to put oil in your turbo first?
3000 hp Viper says come get it.
Hi 👋 hey westen where can I find one of those tools like the one you used to make the exhaust pipe widen up like a flange to slide the other pipe into it you were turning it manually too I'm curious I want one for my f150 to get my trucks exhaust the way I'd like with out couplers or expensive welds from my local muffler shop ??
Your hellcat vs itsjusta6's Hank custom twin turbo f150
Vor er den smuk 🤤
I wanna know why you haven't put an 351 Cleveland in that Jetski
Man this guy would give me a headache really quick just to hyper for me to handle
Gonna need some nice size drag slicks for that thing 😂
1000 hp. 0-60 in 6 seconds    Sounds sweet though.
Eleanor gone in 60 sec
My God how much fuel did you have to throw at that damn thing
needs menthol asap
717?? Lanc pa???
"I didn't get fully on it cause it started to break loose" Oh well I'm sure glad you've got 1000whp now. Idk how you managed to pussyfoot down the highway without it.
Omg your car have super charge and twin turbo in a car omg it really cool 👍🙀
After watching this video, you guys have earned my sub, u guys are funny lol
IllinoiS. That s is actually silent for those who don’t know
is it supercharged and turbocharged
5:27 definitely know that feeling thinking your done then having to tear it apart again
I live 30min from Freeport lol. That’s cool you were in the area
"We're already 200 above and we're just gettin' goin'"
Should have taken the Peterbilt 😂 that way you'd have a bed with you and no need for a hotel room!
" And I don't even see any zip ties, this thing is legit!" 😂
hey my dads friend met you at the carshow that u took that car to his name is tony and hes the one with the blue and white striped camaro ss with the parachute
This car is like a baby doesn’t quit whining 😂 so much boost!!!!
I’m surprise the boost gauge didn’t explode 🤯 😂
me and the guys son have the same birthday
I love you your a fucking mad man
Dang I thought that was you guys I saw in Freeport
All Illinois people are screaming at the screen don’t pronounce the S. I believe it’s French so it’s complicated
err timei get my tools out i say  MIIIIIIIIIIIILLLWAAAAAAAAUKEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Ayo if i see some news that a garage has explode i wont be suprised
not everyday you see a twin turbo supercharged hellcat
Been working on this car for 3 days I need a nap.. shit.. lol I fucking felt that
The only ONLY thing i hate about turbos is that they rust on the "hot side"
Really be glad he pulled that cardboard out😂
rest in piece to the 21 year old son
I want to know who the 375 haters are!!!! What the eff is wrong with you morons? This is gold! You're just whiny biatches because Weston is crushing you in life!
YOU DID IT RIGHT GOTTA KEEP THAT SUPERCHARGER AND ADD THE TURBSKIIS NOBODY WILL EVER COMPETE 🤣😂
where are you guys from i would like to help so much my life is so empty
He didn’t build it, he bolted parts on and brought it to someone who knows what their doing and that man built it
I just liked probably 50 videos in a row I just wanted to show support so you can get a couple extra dollars in your pocket brother 🤟💯
Great videos westen… big fan man. You are such a humble/good spirited human being . You can just tell by your personality that this is 100% the real you, you aren’t acting for the cameras trying to be someone you aren’t . Love it man. Stay this way even when you hit a 5 Million Subscribers ! It’s inevitable to happen!
I really enjoy how excited he's getting over these cars. It's what draws me in
Hey westen I've been watching your videos the past 4-6 months, mostly on Facebook but think you can help me make my 2012 Lincoln MKZ 2.5L hybrid faster? I've seen that you can turbo a mkz but I can't find anything that'll help me
OG knows his shit
See this is what I like everybody has hellcats but he making his different
Why are they crushing the car?!
Westen, a guy in my town is selling a BJ and the Bear 1981 Kenworth K-100 with a Cat 3406 13 speed cabover. I don't know semi trucks but recognized the Kenworth as the same model as the TV show truck. I don't know the fellow selling it. Talked to him once. But he wants it gone. If you know anybody who has been looking to make a BJ and the Bear replica truck. This is for them.
This is amazing great work
That was freaking awesome 👌 👏 👍 😍.  I want my 16 ram 1500 ssv twin turboed now 😆
Went to Roadkill nights in Pontiac met you and you were cool enough to take a picture with my son. Thanks you made our day. You said you loved my sons fro lol
Parts list ?
How do I go about getting a free hellcat? Lmao it seems like everyone is getting one
Hmmm... I wonder if I can do this to my Lincoln Mark VIII?  Seriously...🤔
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Finally someone is doing something I love and like 👍🏾
hey bro can I get a job foreal tho
🤣🤣🤣🤣
🔥🔥🔥🔥
coock it, blow or crash ? - Still alive so
Damn.  Nothing else to say, Westen.  Just, Damn.
were are the 296 hp mising ?
Is the supercharger still working
I literally live 10 minutes down the highway from freeport. Your saying I was 10 minutes away from my favorite youtuber😂😂😭
HELL YES
do you live in kansas city missouri because i saw something that looked familiar
Duuuuude. That's sick as hell.
all that power aint worth a crap if you cant get it to hook up... now work on the suspension and tire set up
It don't matter how much horsepower you have if you have no traction you ain't winning the race
Why would they crush a perfectly good car? If it was going to be crushed wtf do they care what he did with it in the first place?
They crush that hellcat for what 😭?
whats up gamer
Dodge is like watching this and like there saying “ what the hell….”
Which state was that again?  lol
I want to tune like this man..
Now, WHY are they crushing the car ?
I deliver ice in freeport illinois
But the worst part is still that all of that power is being driven through its rear wheels, which makes it a very dangerous car to try to control when it's pressed real hard.  Those cars spin out all the time.
Why didn’t you keep the engine like all the other content creators? It’s a 40k crate engine
Dam man may heart goes out to his son to young. I have a boy of my own my only son I don’t know how he gets through. I couldn’t even get up.
I love this guy
I just subscribed 🔥
Ever thought of putting a 2 cylinder John Deer engine in that Dodge , with 7 turbos? Thanks !
I love the hp tuners guy his enthusiasm and love for this type of thing just makes me happy
love this dude should definitely do more videos with him he’s a hellcat prodigy
Why do they demolish the car ?
3:50 🤫
I live 10min away from Freeport
Speaking of NOS being boring now, have you seen this? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P92fmLpxKHQ
I Hate that he says illinoi(S) especially being from the Freeport area…. But sick car.
Finally somebody doing the good good
I swear Westen Champlin needs his own TV show.
can always gift it to me if yall dont want it ahahahah. nice car tho love it .
That’s cool asf
This is now forever a dream
Song at the beginning of the video?
Ima good friend of landon nivelt couldn't make it but i will next year hope u did good
That thing sounds amazing.
It’s time to manual it
That thing is a beast
“Were just getting started”   “We’re not done yet”  Words from a Hemi God
😂😂 this man is nuts. The video made that seem so easy though lol. Practice driving it and learning it. That’s a whole lot of power to be blindly racing
2:50 “it looks so sick” *Hits fat puddle*
Hope there’s no flooding or anything around 👀
Should’ve raffled the bullhorn srt off if all they were going to do was crush it
Should of brought the peterbilt
Feels like a Diablo tune or pedal commander but it’s a lot stronger pushing crazy 💪🏽
I love the fact that Westin is still a big kid at heart!  The faces he makes are hilarious!
Would love to be given that car😍🙏🏽🙏🏽
The growl at start up on the dyno!! Omg!!
Beautiful sounding car
Jeez Tim is an awesome guy! Does he have a YouTube?
Did you even prime those turbos? You guys are awesome wish I could be apart of this! My friends call me the High Tech Redneck and I have a compound 06’ 5.9l cummins pushing roughly 1100whp! Anywho get r done and should come up to north Idaho on your next trip around!
Thank you for keeping the supercharger; I wish more people would to a super-turbo set-up
That whine is almost as sexy as Alex Taylor's victory
I think they were at the dodge event yesterday
They juss made a REAL DEMON
your car only makes 1000 hp on race fuel not  Regular pump gas
That car I'd well put together.  I watched you run it on Saturday in Pontiac and it was stomping other cars. Keep it up
Them there converter r worth some money!! LOL
You should do something where you help a fan turbo there car
I’ll give it to him the shirt does help🤣🎯
Mechanic reminds me of the guy in drive lol
I bet you don't have a girlfriend
he said illinois with the s bruh
Awesomeness
Wow that is a nice creation
So it’s twins and supercharged?
😂🔥
What ever happened to the old Ford tractor ?
Wait so it had a twin turbo and a supercharger 😳
he just twin charged a hellcat and it’s still running impressive
I got to see this thing run down the drag strip yesterday. It was freaking awesome
After 3 years of riding around with the loud exhaust it finally bore fruit -- the sweet taste of sex.  The guy said for an another $50 he would do me. Unfortunately I didn't have the cash.
Name it triple charged
Cheers to the old man from HP tuners
I WISH I COULD DO COOL CAR STUFFFFF
At 11:11 my wife couldn’t hear the tv. I was watching on my iPhone with volume half way. This thing is a monster
U definitely half asssed everything !!! Thank God the expert helped you out.
That thing should fly wow
through the video it sounds like a Jet engine taking off!   can't wait to see where this goes!
Alex Taylor had daddy Tub hers (Of Course).
18inch wheel with a beefy tire in the back or a 15inch rim conversion
I watch this like 3 times
I saw a quad turbo tractor
I clicked on this video because I thought this was cap, holy crap!
Now you gotta race the twin turbo police charger someday vs this current charger :)
Upload a fucking video dude I don't have anything to watch!
Nice 😎😎👍🏾
Dude you where in my home town man wtf man he’s a cool dude man🤝
What does running on low 7’s mean?
It’s called Illinois
wait a minute the  supercharger is still on
I saw this car yesterday u guys killed it bad mufugga. Good job
The mechanic is awesome. See his focus/passion/knowledge. Incredible.
Poor srt 😢
The best part of the video is when he met Tim and said “you have so much cool stuff” 😂😂😂
NUT
Those twinzies sounds beautiful with that 6.2 and that Supercharger....i genuinely enjoyed this video...when u have a man (Tim) who has cars running 8s say that a car is fast,u better believe that shit..  💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽
Check out this lifted tesla on the random leap YouTube channel
I got sad when you said they going to crush the SRT. I wouldn’t getting it shipped to me in South Africa
My 2jz makes 1800hp this thing is a v8 and twin turbo and only making 1000hp  what a joke
Hell ya brother also Your turner is in my state too let’s gooooo
Kinda sounds like a diesel
They never said you can't put jets on it
Why crush her. 😪😟😕🥺 give her to me....
Barth is the shit! He tuned my car and was the same with me, honest solid guy! Good shit boys!
Wait, so your telling me this hellcat is twin turbo And supercharged. 😳😩
Shit slow
You should do a give away of the twin turbo kit after the roadkill race
Watched RoadKill Nights live today . Great Job 👍👍
Bring it to Mattoon IL car meet its the Broadway drag your love it
Those turbos sound so nice goddamn
good job today at woodward...  you had some good top end pull
That car sound good as hell
Rear diff needs some luck
What was the torque numbers!!! Supercharger and turbo's! That has got to be a hole shot monster!!
It's crazy how car manufacturers do that with the press cars, no VIN or anything. Let people use them then they crush them. It's sad really!
can’t believe they’re going crush that car
U suck at driving lol
Death machine
Fucking awesome
You gotta race against somebody
Ive missed a few days or possibly a week what in the hell has gone on two hellcats i saw when the first srt got dropped off but know to get to this level!!! The smile on your face when u were mounting up the first turbo made me tear up with joy!!! Getterr doneee smack the dash mash the gas and give her hell for ussss!!!!!!
Do a muffler delete
So ur saying you were in Freeport the same time as the fair, which means I was in the same general area as you and I didn’t get to meet you , well shit
Can I has? I got a 14 ZL1 that's got 700 whp but I married and now have 4 step kids...I'd love to have them all in the car and still be fast. You wanna trade?
That made me almost cry when you said they was gonna crush that car I would love to get one for free 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
She sounded amazing at roadkill night she’s a beauty
Hears hellcat wine its all good heat it spool and wine and you fucked up
Dam can i jus be your apprentice hahahahaha
Finally twin turbo man i love this so much !!!!
awesome!!!!
@Mod2Fame what do u think #Mod2Fame
Genius campain for Dodge. I wonder how much Dodge would normally spend for formal research and engineering vs secretly using the creative minds of the muscle car underworld...
This man is hilarious and don’t mention how great the content is😂😂
That man Bart is cooo asf once u get my kitty gotta hit his shop
The sounds give me eargasms😅
why cant you hear the whine anymore?
ILLINOIS / THE S IS SILENT
Love it mate! If only we could get Charger Hellcats in Australia there would be one in my driveway... Does anyone know how much boost the stock supercharger makes on its on??
So this is what they call Nekoboost
When are you racing today/tonight???
Woah someone explain to me why they gonna crush the srt
I love this 😂😂
Holy crap that’s cool
Why o on the bottom :( now u can’t see no turbo no more :(
Westen this video is by far one of the most entertaining ive watched, the cuts, the zoom ins, the terminology. Also loved the conversations with that tuner. Absolutely fantastic content keep up the great work!
I hear a knock a comin already
The sound of the turbos spooling up
wait so you can supercharge and twin turbo a car at once
Dude hell yeah man! You were just down the road from me.
Who else just saw westen whoop ass on his live races
Dodge hook me up
Westen is just a car obsessed Wario
Wait, but so why did you get rid of the SRT and why did it get crushed? 😒
Good ole Freeport Illinois, never thought I'd hear that in a popular YouTube video.
Oh holy shit. I missed Westin in Freeport. Goddammit. Freeports less than 10 miles from where I live
Do you have somekind oil return pump for turbos to keep them live:D?
Just found this channel and I love the energy
if this doesn’t prove how durable and reliable hellcat motors are idk what will lol
what the fuck i live in fucking freeport illinois
Illi NOISE????? lol *triggered*
Love the paint job
Twin chargered hellcat???
You should try and beat the honigan
I want to see a build series on the limited
Ur gonna hurt it!!! Tune the damn thing could be revving the shit out of it very lean or rich scoring cylinders and washing out very important oil.
instead of nitrous, meth inject it
Bruh I’m not pulling over for nun
Why they going to crush it?
I was scooping ice cream at that fair
When this is all finished and ready; maybe some digs with StreetSpeed717's ZR1?!
'I stuck my finger in it, now it runs good'.   I've seen adult films that started out like this!
Needs an intercooler between them turdskis and the mower.
If it’s 1200 hp to the wheels… what is it at the crank? This is going to be a fucking beast
“It’s fast” 😂
Bro how are people so mechanically inclined? I mess up cold air intakes 😬🤣
Bro I was thinking abt doing that a scatpack yesterday
Tim is a fucking legend. Can’t get more natural than that. Mopar Baby!!!
Look my guy y'all are awesome. My dream car is a 2019 charger hellcat. DREAM LOL love the work
It’s always the alternator
I get some Matty Matheson vibes from this dude
My ears are fucking dead
Alternative title for this video: America
Love the hellcat builds
This is a prime example of how much love, support, and fun the car community is to each other.
Build a retardedly high HP car - Check Reasoning behind that - MERICUH
I'm so glad you got a professional tuner to work the bugs out buddy. This video made me very happy.
This the most American thing I heard from, me and my (recently re-shaved) mullet had to crack a Busch latte... to hear this vid and im :53 seconds deep
What was sticking out the back of the first one???
This man triple charged the thing. I've officially busted both my nuts.
tnx for the video
Man that’s fire 🔥 can’t wait to see it in action. Michigan in the building💪🏽🌪
More of this please
Why tf they gonna crush it
i could feel that thick sucking air all the way across the sea
T top that B****!
Idk why but if I had to guess I'd say he probably uses HPTuners. Just a hunch.
That is absolutely ****** nuts… lol  Good job man.
Westen you be making scary shit from hell man! This is nuts I like it
I never was told why dodge is destroying the other hellcat.
I was hoping you’d twincharge it with the twin turbos. That would be badass. Amazing power and torque across the entire rev range.
can you roll down a hill faster then you're car fat man
I wanna turbo my Dodge Journey 😫
If this isn't a future customization/mod in racing Sims so help me God, I'll shit
Is it that easy set twin turbos ?
YouTube unsubbed me, did it do this to anyone else too?
fuck yessssss
why'd dodge take and crush the hellcat?
Your a real jewel
They launch Rockets with Hydrogen Peroxide So why not try that ???
8-13 its his sons Bday today
Stranger: What kind of car do you have?  Western Champlin: I have an SRT HELL YEAH CAT with 1300hp Twin Turbo
Why is he getting rid of the srt and what’s happening to it?
wait is the supercharger still in there or no?
yessssssssssssssssssssssssssssss illinoissssssssssssssssssssssssssssss  a youtuber is in my home state
Supercharger and twin turbos!!🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
I would like a free hellcat as well 😀
Rip headphone users 0:01
Maybe im deaf but i dont like how i cant hear the supercharger
Chill westen your gonna break the dyno
Booyah
What isn't it supercharged
not dogging on it and maybe its the camera audio quality. It kinda sounds like shit lol
Please get vinyl to get it to look like the thumbnail
CANT believe the car isn’t manual
4:20  Can we just for a quick second take in the fact that no matter where you go, no matter which corner of the earth you are in, or what you're doing...  There will be a 3rd gen Toyota 4runner just patiently waiting for its owner to return and go on the next adventure.
You need to race this thing on Hoonigan’s This Vs That!!
JUST SO HAPPENED TO WATCH THIS VIDEO ON AUGUST 13.........
Like your videos. Keep them coming
The best 😍😍😍😍🔥🔥🔥🔥👌🏼🏁
like me, who here likes the sound of the turbos better than the supercharger,
Shit that’s were I’m taking my hell cat
I find it funny that Dodge tried to send the car to the crusher, but it was sent to Westin.  Same thing really... Lol
Fuck yea finally here !!!!!!! Took long enough 😂
They say Tim's the best! Car is ridiculous!!! I love it
“is it supercharged or turbo charged?” westen: yes
Now THAT is a good tuner.
Is it triple charged supercharger twin turbo
I think TWIN TURBO AND SUPERCHARGED HELLCAT would have been a more catchy title
so glad is subscribed yall work so damn hard to get these vids out you deserve it. Don't know how I haven't seen this before but love you guys.
my birthdays 8-13 as well. i feel bad for Tim 😔
Westen where are you from?! I live in Freeport, IL!!!
Happy birthday Tim's son, gone too soon, you will be missed and loved but never forgotten. Fly high~
I'm Jabba Jaw!! woowoowoowoowoo!!!
Hey, my Jeep has a V6.. cough cough.. do ya thing haha.  Jk. A man can only dream
That thing sounds like an even throatier duramax wtf.
Tim Barths sons birthday is today August 13th
Westen I love your tuner.
all i heard on the dino was freedpm and alot ALOT of yee yees
I love how Westen mispronounced Illinois EVERY TIME...
942hp then 1000hp with a supercharger and TTs…. That’s it?!?!?!
Forgot to hook up the alternator?!?!  I know u be saying that y’all don’t know shit about working on cars and trying to be funny about it.  But that says A LOTT about y’all’s mechanic skills. So I guess y’all ain’t lying when you say “we don’t know anything”. Lol
Who would dislike this video!! 🤦🏻‍♂️!!!!!
Why are they taking it back if they just going to crush it
Pull the rotor pack out the blower so technically it still has the blower and you can really throw the boost at with the turbos and really make big power
I find it ironic that i’m watching this video today, and today is my birthday…8-13.  Sorry to hear about him losing his son
Can I come work for u for free
I WAS AT THAT COUNTY FAIR. HOWD I NOT KNOW YOU WERE IN MY TOWN GOT DAMMIT
Sounds like my diesel's turbo... coming from a gas car. Quite insane
Nice!!!! Freeport is 45 minutes north of me
Makes me happy to see this guy happy ngl😃
That hemi making all the right noises! Mine just knocks 😔
Definition of insane AMAZING love mopar
Why are they going to crush it
Happy Birthday in heaven Andrew Barth! 🙏🙏
Put some thick boys on the back
Merica🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲
Next the supercharger pulley 😂
I'm not even a car guy but your channel is amazing entertainment.
Put a shirokai widebody kit on it
Dude..u av d dest expressions in the world...lol..what's so amazing about u work..is u always know what ur doing but u don't know what ur doing...& in the end u create a masterpiece...
When it starts it sounds like a lion from hell
with that power it kicks out the rear end like a mustang hunting for crowds
I did not know you lived here in Kansas
Freeport!!!

This build has already been done by some dude up in Colorado he said even with the sea level being so high above from it , it still run  pretty decent I wanna say this build was about 6-10 months ago check it out because it is the legit original twin turbo supercharged f**kcat
I live in IL I would love to go to Barth to turbo charge my srt jeep 😮‍💨 excellent promo cause I was looking for a performance shop in my state
Hellcats 🥴❤️
https://youtu.be/bHdeK4TyWYs
no burnout before loading?!?!
seeing how happy a man is putting on his 80th turbo gives me life
Definitely a just cause 😊😌
but still gets beat by a tesla at the end of the day.
Love your videos man
man ben watching your videos for a long time and love them all. wish i would have known you came to freeport when you did could have stayed with me and my wife and had your own room and everything. love you man keep up the good work much respect
Your awesomeness never let's viewers down.  The war bird paint scheme is killer.
Stop wrenching and start walking.  Your heart will thank you
I think u should put the gas tank in the truck of the hellcat
Hurts to see other people living your dream, I need one, stock hellcat is amazing but twin turbo is amazing
I saw a car just like your old hellcat near the Detroit area and couldn’t remember why it looked so familiar but now I know lol
Just earned yourself a new subscriber 👍🏾
Can I like a video twice?
Jesus Christ died on the cross for our sins (past, present and future), was buried in a tomb and rose again on the third day. Once a person believes the gospel they are sealed and guaranteed eternal life. OSAS.
Is nobody gonna talk about how he says Illinois
Make sure to check oil often lol
As a safety professional I would advise you to use both hands when using a saw, especially the way you used it to cut that hose. Get your friend to hold one end, or else you could end up with far worse than what he got on his thumb. Believe me I know, I had to take a Guy to the hospital for nearly cutting his whole thumb off with a band saw because he was doing the exact same thing you were doing. Just some advice, fucking love what you're doing with the hellcat!
Im a diesel guy and i hate the looks of those chargers but that lil lady gives me a chubby!!! Daaaang!!
Dang i wish i could gp saturday but im going next weekend.😪
4 wat
Please tell me that the paint job / wrap on this monster is whats shown on the thumbnail of this video
Holly crap..
This is why i like dodge. Like here you go do something dumb to this engine and make it FAST AS F$%&. Environmentally friendly? waz dat!
Put aftermarket tires on it or like smaller drag slicks and then test it on the drag strip.
Omg that shit is bad ass
That tuner seems cool as hell
Is this the first bi charged hellcat
Gale banks wants to know why you haven’t got another intercooler between the turbo and the supercharger !
Awesome work 🤘🏽🇺🇸🤘🏽
Sweet. I go through freeport Illinois every weekend. We camp out at emerald acres campground in pearl city which is by freeport
Westen you the man!!
The guy said stock was over 600hp but that car actually came with 797hp
I need this whip bring it to MN don't destroy it in Detroit
I live 20 minutes from there! I would have come and picked y'all up and brought you to a hotel 😂
That's sick af I want hell cat now asap
You and cleetus McFarland need to get together because yous to are as crazy as each other😂
I'm sorry westin but that is a cheesy lookin thumbnail you in a jet fighter suit trying to look cool sorry i said no he isn't trying to do that is he
"Almost like we knew what we was doing."
Twin turbo? That’s childish. Get some quad turbo action going and we will get you 300k likes
9:23 Car is a Dragon
Mad respect to that mopar guy
I thought I knew a lot about cars, but I had no idea you can run twin turbos and a supercharger
The way the video finishes lmaol
Horaaay
Bro you're fucking crazy
Pumpkin-head on a potato.
Chumlee does cars now ???
Is the thing supercharged and turbocharged
Daaaaammmmmnnnn lol sickest hellcat charger  ever
The supercharger sounds like it was passing gas when it didn’t wanna start 😂😂
Really enjoy watching your videos 👍🏆🥇👌🔥great stuff.
*Hey, to you reading* .. you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
Freeport is 30 mins away from me
Wtf did I just watch, ive never been so hard in all my life.
You gotta hand it to Dodge on this marketing initiative....pre production cars end up scrapped and stripped regardless, so why not give them away and let influencers sell your brand even more.
This thing HAS to race street speed 717s zr1 when it's done
There going to crush it is that because it was involved in a crime or something
that thing sounds absolutely amazingly insane
Awesome job Weston! Keep up the good work! Love your videos!
You are hilarious
Holy mother of god
Dude when you said you were coming to IL my actual hometown was the last place I expected that's pretty cool lol
Couldn't think of another youtuber who deserves this more. Congrats westin I hope you kill it
So much crazy shit in one video. Hell yea man keep it up!
Sus
They’re gonna crush it wtf????
Bro he should have done some engine and other drive train work because I have a feeling it is not gonna run right at all or it’s gonna blow some shit
Hi
Westen I live in Freeport and I wasn't there because I was visiting a friend in Tennessee. Did you go to the fair?
Hellion! The home town boys!
“We’re not done”
😱
Love how the cheesy montage was interrupted by Westen dragging the table. I lost it. 😜
Protect those snails bro
You should give it to me .
Just need an explanation On whether the car is twin charged or not???
GOD BLESS THIS CHANNEL!! GROWN MAN DREAMS RIGHT HERE ! SHESHHH
At low rev this cars sound like a Bugatti Chiron at low rev ?
Best YouTube video ever
Love The Part where old mate says "yeah we're not done we'll let it cool down" 😤😜
wait i didnt know you can turbocharge a hellcat cause i though if it has a supercharger it cant be both
2:34 *THERE'S A TURBO ON THIS CAR! IT'S OFFICIALLY ON THERE!* "bolt falls"
Oh man I wish I knew you were in Freeport. I'm like 20 minutes away I would've LOVED to have driven over for a meet up. Shame I didn't know :(
I want two hellcats so bad. There's a reason for two. I'm gonna drive the wheels off of one, and I want the other one to stay nice and only be a little wild with it :)
Sounds so good
Can’t wait to see this girl in person Saturday
This car will both scream and laugh at you as it flies by
In my day we did it internally not with bolt on parts.  Sorry not Sorry 😐
Wait so it’s twin turbo and supercharged
Nice
its crazy because you can hear the supercharger and terbskis
corvette are going to put there tail between there legs and run in the opposite way.
Fuck yeah brotha
I have a feeling that hemi won't last long 😂
Tim Barth is a fucken legend!!! tear it up Westen!!
YOU STILL GOT THAT TABLE....
Oh Hell Yeah!!!!
I KNOW WAYS TO MAKE POWER THAT I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYONE USE.
That guy is a beast
Where's the Peterbilt?
Why did that other charger get crushed I.   Mean I dream of cars like this and I don’t have money to buy or build and it gets crushed
Dude this guy deserves a gold medal what a mad scientist lol love it bro great job
Now how in the world is it gone grip 🤨 thang gone be spinnin 😭
#42 on trending hell yea
You did not!!
YES I CANT WAIT TO SEE THIS CAR AT ROADKILL NIGHTS ITS GONNA BE AWESOME
Please for the love of god why do people pronounce the s. It's a silent s in Illinois
Everyone who uses nitrous is a dummy it will destroy your engine
Yo are you gonna put drag tires on it
Say hello to new set of tires every month 😆 hellya
Why are they crushing the other Charger?!
bro fuck twins get a quad turbo
Slow car blower and twin turbo 1200 something is wrong or maybe need a chevy engine 💪🏼
My man s is silent
Yes sir be safe from lumberton Texas awsome video love it
Westen!!! Your video is #42 on trending!! amazing
Should’ve did cams and a smaller pulley as well!!
Why are they crushing the old srt dodge I'd sell it if it had to be taken away
Mag-friken'-nificent!
Oh hell yes!!! And she sounds sooo good too and it's the sickest sounding hellcat I have ever frealong heard and them turbos sound so good as hell
A super charged twin turbo hell cat??? 🍿🍿🍿🍿
Happy birthday Barth 😤
Well Wes I knew you were going to do something crazy but pumping 2 turbskis through the blower might as well give it a 100 shot on that tank. Do you need to keep stock tire lmao
People really need to start doing things the Westen way. Looks alot more fun...less safe... but much more fun.
Instead of wasting the hellcat and crushing it..... Give it to me instead?
Kinda wrong when u say everybody use nitrous on hellcats not really maybe where you located  good video tho
Lol I want to take my cars to that guy, only if I lived in the state
Not a dodge fan but after this maybe
Best sounding hellcat on the internet
Hey can I buy the rear spoiler from you please. I want it for my rt
Oh hellcat yea!
🤣 we can't afford to race it, but if we could it would be fast.  Westen is a pure man of genius.
Every mans dream
Hell yea westen
Did anyone else scream without the s
nothign makes me happier than westen champlin happy when the turbo sounds happen lol
wish I knew that you came to my little town there is nothing here I'm just shocked that you picked freeport to get that beast of a car tuned up
So is it straight exhaust, saw the pipes on the driveway lol 😝
Had turbo and supercharger on Detroit diesels since the 60s and 70s. Had a 700hp 8V92TA. In 80s and 90s. Guys were building 92s and making over 1000hp. With a 12V92 they would twin turbo and supercharge. Tons of fun
I like it
Yeeee yeeeee!
I don't even see any zip ties in here lol
It's like a kid in a candy shop 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Insane!
Reminds me of when I met "Johnny Lightning", while tuning a replica of the "Fast and Furious" 1999 Ford F-150 SVT Lightning. Talent.
Dude no way you were at freeport! I was working the county fair!
I was just taking about you with my wife yesterday. Was wondering if you got sick again? Your video uploads are getting pretty spread out.
Make sure to have supporting mods
You should weld the differential so that ur wheels don't slip out
Let’s go. Can’t wait. I’m heading to Michigan 2 today. We will be there rooting you on
That sounds sick, lets see what Tavarish do with his car. But remember the most important part is the one controlling the pedals and steering, that means YOU Western.
Wait.. you can put turbos on a already supercharged engine???
please make long build videos.  long detailed videos with Westen would be epic
WELD WHEELS N SLICKS PLS
“942 to the tire?” “We’re not done” best shit I’ve heard all day
This man is doing things to cars that’s not even possible in video games. Legendary.
Not to far from me we’re lucky to have him in this area but car culture is huge in so ILL
Now get that powerglide and rear end, gear it about 185mph for second gear. tube the rear and gage that effing thing. Did you blow up the exhausmanifold casget, or what is leaking
BRUH. THATS FUCKING amazing 😂😂😂👀👀🥵🥵🥵
Me wishing my 5.7 could have a supercharger and a twin turbo kit 😞
Why are they smashing the SRT???
My dream build🥺🥺
That hellcat sounds fucken mean
🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻 hell yeah
That’s how it’s should sound from the facktory
no tune STAY RUNNNNINNNNGGGGGG
what a guy that tuner is, just a stand up original.
Dude that's awesome your the man
Too easy
Everyone uses nitrous to get hi- yeah hellcat.
I love it!!👍👍👍👍
Woooootttttt wooootttttttttttt
That wrap is sick
nice car, makes me want to do an upgrade on my hellcat
So basically this is a twin turbo supercharged charger, its like saying this in a crazy dream
Damn I wish I had that car or anything like it
Don't know how strict the rules are but twin turbo kit from Hellion $8000 tune cost and nitrous i don't see it being at or below $10000. But it is a fun competition so i guess it doesn't matter.
Westen your a maniac ! That thing is gonna scream ! I wish I could be there to see it .
Very good last point. Don't let it fall off the trailer.
“Just don’t let it fall off the trailer.” - Spoken like a true father.
15th in Trending!!!!!
Twin Chargered Hellcat 🔥🔥 Wow
l oh shit this gone be lit
We’re not done we gone let it cool down …easiest best line of the video
Just glad my Charger Hellcat made your video haha! (The white one on the lift in the shop!) Badass build man!
Sounds great and thats a lot of power. That being said.....after watching Alex Taylors build, I think you might be in trouble.
That man is a god I need him to try to do that to my trk
I'm waiting on a turbo kit to show up for my Suzuki bandit. 250 hp on a 485 pound motorcycle. I CANT WAIT!!
It sounds like a deisil
I love the editing
8k for the TT kit, hope you have money left in the 10k budget for some super sticky tires and CV shafts maybe. Cause with all that power and the tires hook, you are snapping/breaking shit lol.
That’s insanely badass
That coffee holding Gentleman is my kind of people
Like your rubber hose installation technique, just dont use same style installing c o n d p m s!!!
Freeport is a shithole
2:34 "There's a turbo on this car! Bolt: NOPE"
Twin charged hellcat that's epic for sure. Your gonna smoke the competition with that build!!
“Just don’t let it fall off the trailer.” - Spoken like a true father.
You really just twincharged a hellcat. I am quite scared of this new demon on the street
Hopefully someday he can learn how to say Illinois properly. Its not Illinoise   just sayin....
942 horse per tire... wait did i hear that right?
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=s7QD5ZGFcqI
@kalimuscle
I knew this took some time I had to replace 2 pistons on my charger. This got to take a significant amount of time
Why is dodge crushing that hell kitty 😢
There’s no S in Illinois buddy
Looking forward to see it live this Saturday. May the best build win.
this car scares me. twin charged hellcat.
Wow that’s #Evil
Twin charging was the perfect idea got damn son that sound 🇺🇸😍
I like how they didn't even give us the juice and teased us with a half glass of pulp free OJ!
Thats the nastiest sounding 6.2 I’ve ever heard
Mister Barth is a bad bad man
HELL YEAH! Awesome Hellcat Westin! :D
Heck yeah! Was hoping to meet you at RoadKill Nights with the HellKota but couldn’t get ready in time so had to cancel! Good luck brother! 💪🤘
waiting for the engine go boom.
Don’t forget to wax it so it breaks through air.  Add HP by caking it with stickers.
DIY Jose should send Phoenix to Tim asap!
The video was watched by many people in a short time. 1 like from me. How did you get to this level? What can I do to get more people to see my video?
How can I buy the srt wrapped car before it crushed I don’t care about a title ether
B.C. and A.D. are timemarks everyone uses. Christ is the one and only Lord and Savior. No peace without repentance and resurrection.
Mod to Fame needs to see your tuner big time. Love your setup.
The horns on that car are so stupid... i need some
Dam Westen that Hell Kitty is a beast! I can't wait to see you test it out! I'm betting you will literally shred the tires right off the wheels!
editing and music choice on fire my guy
Twin Turbo Supercharged Hellcat vs Twin Turbo Cummins Mustang when
Man you need to do a humvee.
The biggest reason your channel has exploded is the raw emotions you show and everyone would love to be doing what you are doing. 😄😄😄
Ive been waiting for this video for some time now! Now i can sleep dreaming about those turbo whistles 😴
What happened to the 4x4 hellcat?
Dodge..
Does Tim do other brands by chance?
6:15 so if you didn't know this is called twin charging, to have both a supercharger and a turbo or in this case twins. This is the sound I imagine when I hear someone mention twin charging
Sooooooooooooo.....  Can we get back to the trucks?! Team Torque!!!!
Illanoise is exactly correct, lol!
Come on people. It’s westen! It’s gonna fall of the trailer. 😂
soo you took my advice & added 2x turbos congratulations & you're welcome
I wonder if he was able to find the 10mm socket when he was doing all this and if if he lost it 😂
"yeah we're not done." what a badass dude
-COOOOOCCCC×CCCCCCC9999999999999×99999999999CIO99999999999999999 NINETY-NINth  power
You were in my hometown I would let you stay at my place
I’m not a car guy but you got a like From me just on the sound
So, the previous cop car was allegedly "1400 HP" and we are suppose to be excited over a Hellcat only making 1300 with professional tuning and high end modifications? Did I miss something?
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Seen new BRONCO...SUCK...SEEN 1991 SPORT BRONC ...WANT IT .NEW ONES sucks LOOKS LIKE BRONCO 2.HAHHAHAA...WANWA GET A POWER STOKER ON IT  .WILL BE NICE..1000 LIKE TO MAKE IT..???
What a waste! You shoulda put a wrap and a stupid light bar on it 🤦‍♂️smh
What ever happened to the guys that use to be regulars in his videos?
The tune made all the difference
Westen has a great attitude about life,  love the channel bro👍
Put a jet engine on it
DUDE!  I only live like 45 minutes away from Freeport!
Love your content!! Stay safe everyone ❤️❤️❤️
Someone is using your name and photos for fake Facebook accounts, I have been sent 2 requests
Make it AWD
The hemi engines gonna be like OH MAH GAWD!!
Insane…!!
That car literally just sounded like ear rape after you guys were done with it jfc
i thought the smoke stang gave me a chubby this thing gave me ….. 😳 damn that car sounds so good
Man Tavarish has 0 chance.
That's such a sick setup, legit the chance of a lifetime to get to mod this beast
I knew he was gonna do something with the car but not something this crazy. I’ve never seen a super charged turbo hellcat ever in my entire life. I don’t think anyone has lol
If you’re reading this... I wish and pray you are blessed x 1,000,000 with good karma 😊😊😊😊🙏🙏🙏🙏😊🙏😊🙏😊🙏😊🙏😊🙏😊🙏😊🙏🤩🙏😊💛🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
If mounting them that low.  I’d recommend putting a FOD screen on those Turbos. Otherwise. They can get ugly in the next week or few weeks
Wait, why are they going to crush the SRT? Were you kidding?
I think my dream car is that car with those turbos, in the special “Hell Raison” purple.
Why no "cc". Google doesn't know what language you speak
All this work and no one explained the importance of tires and suspension... get er done w
We neeeeedddd am updateee on the 4x4 build
Westen I think this guy watches your videos,  especially when said don't let it fall off the dang trailer. 🤔 🤣🤣🤣😂😁
Video of Hunter Biden and hooker on Daily Mail video.  Story on zerohedge.
So many happy noises.  Glad this happened.
Gandalf working on cars is just silly
i like the content but cant watch it, videos are way to shaky, it make me want to vomit all over myself
Race the ken block in his mustang
So is this video made before you went racing there you're going to give all your secrets out to the other competitors :-)
that is the most terrifying hellcat ive ever seen in my life. i dont think anything can change that either😳😂
What ever happened to the guy that was helping you work on the big blue Pete?  And what happened to the truck or that bulldozer???
that thing sounds INSANE
Just need some EV badges on it
I want to see a race between him and mod2fame!!!
so how long till he straight pipes it, that would be loud
Thought you'd forgot about us fans as there hasn't been a upload for a while. But this was so worth the wait.
https://youtu.be/SQbhjymXtPk
Jesus Christ is coming back soon! please take it serious what he spoken of is coming to pass right before our eyes.. it’s not a joke,so  y’all need to know the saving salvation of ur soul..that is in Jesus Christ who bore our sins He’s the way the truth and the life He brutality died on the cross to pay the penalty for all of our sins so that if you acknowledge you’re a sinner that’s sinned against His law and you turn to Him by confessing with your mouth that Jesus Lord and believe that he was raised from the dead and call upon his name and repent of ur sins you would be forgiven and saved spared from damnation and Heaven bound God bless you
You are the man....
What a fucking beast!!
Can’t wait for you to race this monster.
so sorry I been on this channel for a while and was not subscribed
Turbos make everything better!  Anybody want to check out my Turbo Diesel Jeep?  https://youtu.be/wOZJlzd8Oeg
@westen Next Project: Come to Dallas and grab my POS 2015 Cummins and turn it into a beast! Please of course
You need too race itsjusta6 with his 1200 hp gt350
Man that drive was worth it .The car is coming along .Man that power is crazy .
So it's 800hp weight to ratio...  Not hooking up at all. 🤷🏻‍♂️
Beast
Did he say 942 to the wheels yeah I’m for sure heading straight into a wall 😂😂😂
...”just don’t let it fall off the trailer,” quote of the day!
I like the way you think pal.
damn , that thing is scary
Thats the moment in life when tou hit a curb you start worrieng about your turbos not ur wheels
Its like watching a unicorn being born with Pegasus flying in the backround 👍🏽👍🏽
https://youtu.be/SQbhjymXtPk
I still can’t get over that he said Illinois with the s
Where did you say you were taking it to race and when is it?
This thing will get stolen when he comes to Woodward
Westen is an absolute lunatic.
I see massive foreshadowing at the end of the video 😬😬😬😂
All the manufacturers crush their experimental cars, they can't legally sell them because they don't have a vin number. They can't be registered and plated.
What a legend man 🥺❤️
11:52   that's the most serious "its fast ever"
W
What's the stuff hanging off the backend on both chargers
Sees sons tribute car.  I fuckin lose it
Whatever dodge pays to get it crushed they can pay me and ill take the car instead
Bless the man tuning ur car has a good heart. He tuned it like a champ.
Is the banana in the shop?  Why is here?🤔🤔🤔
If you’re ever back in Freeport please have a meet and greet, I’m from there and never thought anything like this was possible
Dude CHAPLIN that’s insane bro GOOD JOB 👏🏾  Sounds soooooooo good as well 🤯😫👌🏾🔥
So sick bro!
I am really curious to see if you can get it to hook up on the drag strip.
Teslas smirking
I dont think ive ever heard more wonderful sounds coming from one car
Storm rolled through yesterday and knocked out the power, the worst part was hearing about a new Westen vid and not being able to watch. :(
Twins and supercharger that’s the ticket I would like to have that Srt For Free
Mod2Fame has done it already and he also did it to a manual 🤣🤣 little late might wanna check him out cause he actually has the fastest 50-130 time street/track but good luck 👍🙌
when he comes to the race dodge going to be like. westen what the actual fuck did you do.
you know its good when its goes weeeeee pfffffff
10 of the World's Funniest One Liners!  1. Vacation begins when Dad says, "I know a short cut." 2. Evolution: True science fiction.   3. According to my best recollection, I don't remember. 4.

If Barbie is so popular, why do you have to buy her friends? 8. Stop repeat offenders. Don't re-elect them!   9. If you don't like the news, go out and make some. 10. For every action there is an equal and opposite criticism.    EDITORIAL: Probably the most thought-provoking one-liner is "Eat right. Stay fit. Die anyway." It's sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die. This is because you have sinned against God. Let's see if that's true: Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God will never let you down.Visit needgod.com
Dam that mean
Yay twin charged, that's that next level type shit. Hellyeah brother!
Too easy
I hope you win this thing
So glad this channel supports Trump 🙌 🙏 👏 ❤ 💕 😊 🙌 🙏 👏 ❤ 💕 😊 🙌 🙏 👏 ❤ 💕 😊 🙌 🙏 👏 ❤ 💕 😊 🙌 🙏 👏 ❤ 💕 😊
Wow didn't think Westen would reduce himself to click bait....the guy said 1004 hp at the end....where is the 1300?
Hells bells, I’m so looking forward to seeing the cat race. 😎
Fast⚡⚡
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates🎈
You might wanna put some slicks on that  thing 🤔
What's the song at 6:34 ?
Only westen would say "hey lets twin turbo a supercharged Hellcat and put nitrous"
I love you westen
Getting Tim Barth to tune this car is like cheating Westen, LOL. Google Mopar God and you'll see a picture of TIm Barth.
you know I would've swapt some parts (everything) from the SRT to the other hellcat, why bother they gonna scrap it anyways.
RT life is doing this to his 6.4
That is going to be one hell of a handful when you really give it some
Westen: in awe about the car making 900+hp Tuner: yeah, we're not done 
“A precision turbinator” I Fucken love this guy. 🤣🤣🤣
Rocket on wheels. Good luck in Detroit.
You need to put drag slicks on it
westin ive had this idea for a while and your the only person I think who can do it a cummins minivan with a lift
I grew up 45 minutes to 30 from Freeport Illinois little-town called Monroe Wisconsin
Dodge should just Cummins swap out of the factory and call it smokekat
That man is a savage
Only on here to comment don't really watch your videos but... didn't dodge take the helical back or you just gonna keep messing with them til you get one?
Jet fuel is kerosene Weston mate, you don't want to stick that in your car, well maybe an old diesel, but defo not a snazzy modern car, it'll never talk to you again.
Sabaton last stand
sick sick sick!!! i love it!
Freaking awesome!
Did it say 1300 hp somewhere? Or was that crank horse
2:34   : "It's officially on there!"  *Bolt falls out*
ill-i-noy
That thing sounds sick!
That Hellcat is a monster!!! Go get that trophy Westen you go this!!!
Westin make sure that thing hooks up because Dennis Taylor spent a lot of time making sure their car hooks up. You have done a fine badass job on that car. I’m pulling for you!
Wow! What a beast (as if the Hellcat wasn't quick enough already).🤣👍
So...it's supercharged and twin turbos ? How does that work ?
Earned my like 💯💯💯
Top 10 trending videos on YouTube!
Bringing a knife to a gun fight against Alex Taylor!
Don’t let fall of the trailer.  The best
Oh hell yea bro u going to win 100%
Yessss you listened to one of the many comments saying to twin charge it 🙌🏽🔥
My brain saw two minutes of putting turbos on my brain spent the rest of the video worrying about a slapped together car even tho I know it was done right
This dude needs to post more or make longer vids man 😡
You're not missing anything guys. The Hellcat SRT was actually kind of ugly. The twin turbo Hellcat is a beauty!
That car is awesome one day I hope to have something like it
Holy fuck it sounds amazing
I only live 30 min away from Freeport!
It sounds like a wounded Beast🦁
Hey love the videos, the s in Illinois is silent man.
Charge pipes gonna hold together?? Hopefully better than the stang’s charge pipes. I know it’s all for science. Great job, wish I had the garage space to do these things.
I live a hour away from freeport
Why we are watching. Let's drive with asphalt 9 bro let go 👌
Next week: Turbnoscharged race gas hellcat.
Only person on YouTube that puts out a 10min video every 2 weeks and has 1.5 million subscribers. Imagine what he could do with a 20min video twice a week. Awesome channel
Weston, thank you for showing more of the build! It felt like the videos we all know and love! What a monster!
What an awesome build! But also, feels like you slapped a couple Twin Turbos on your editing too. Well done!!
Why ain't every one twin turboing there hellcat
If you can keep them Wheels from spinning it would take off like a jet
maybe your best editing yet I love the suspense
11:35 bro he has a literal TRX behind him😂👌
Was planning to come see you in action but nobody want to take me. Have a blast!!
I've been around many nasty hellcats and this things nasty!!!
I need that octane
are you racing throtl?
"We're not done." Now THAT's the spirit!
I need one!!
Wasn't Goonzquad going to put turbos on supercharged hellcat too?
They could have me That Srt If they was gonna Crush it
Traction is gonna be fun
Fucken beast man 🥵🔥
What a great start to the project!! Very happy we could be a part of this build!!
That thing wrapped out FAST on the dino. Can't wait for tires!
He opened saying nos is boring because everybody does it. I would say many people twin turbo stuff including some manufacturers. Then I thought... Oh twin turbos with a supercharger. Cool idea. I've asked about that on forums before with an answer of there no point both are  forced induction. Oh well, have fun Westin.
8/13 is my mom's birthday! Happy early birthday to that guys son!
Hey we need a link to get your Merch!
Weston got a new helper And he's got a mullet Hell yeah!
holy fuck that sound
it look like that genius knows you (hahaha)
That is amazing with Tim was able to do with that, WOW!!!
love your video's.............
Can you keep it tho
Meanwhile stellantis can’t get vehicles shipped to dealers across the country.
Damn if I send you my car will you trick it out?~
If you don't grenade this engine in 5 passes, I will be sorely disappointed.
omg careful driving over speed bumps!!
Thank you for showing the tuner. Always good business.
How many chargers does this man own
U got to race itsjusta6 twin turbo mustang he it a Youtubers
I’d love to get my 350R to this guy see what he can be done
Can I buy this off you. I’m being so serious
The gaping reading fourthly cheat because need pertinently scrub up a well-made yugoslavian. well-off, spiteful middle
Tim Barth is the man! He built my mustang back when he owned Modular Powerhouse.
Dodge says you must keep the supercharger.  Westen adds twin turbos so there is more boost than motor.  This man is a living legend!
Damn your might just give Alex T a run Westen
loving these videos! keep smiling and hauling-ass Westen!!
Shout out to Freeport !!! I live in Rockford, aka, Rockbottom, right next door. I'm in Freeport very often, my big brother n lil sister and many friends live there.
🤘 if you aint first your last. Go win that race bud!
Time to upgrade your shop lights my guy
Right Now someone is twin turbo-ing a Hellcat.
ohh... i though you will bucher turbski in lol
Now you need some really sticky tires!
Twin turbo, supercharged hellcat?  I-
Is it stock long block?
i need a 30 min video, minimum... thanks <3
This man has made it so far I remember when he started just by rebuilding old work trucks
This man builds everything me and my friends think off doing while stoned
why does it kinda sound like a 7.3
So its twin charged
Listen to that thing  That guy knows his stuff  I think Freddie is quaking in his boots  I think you need some really wide back tyres now 😍😍😍👍👍👍
Tim seems like a cool af down to earth man.
I love that this isn’t a 50 part video. Great job, can’t wait to see it run the track
You’re a beast bro!!
Barth is the hellcat god.
Killer man....keep doin your thing!!
Maybe the reason why Dodge gave you a hellcat for free but gave you some special instructions was for you to make it faster and better for drag race and when the day comes for you to race it they would send some undercover engineers to see your work and ask you a lot of questions but you won’t know they are from dodge bc they are undercover and see how well and fast the car is so later they can use your work and probably put in in the next production car Dodge has in mind 🤔 but hey that’s just a theory a subscriber theory andddddd cut.
Xxam shop with me. ,,,,,,
This is amazing
What a beast.
0:57 that table has been through some shit
You found your tuner! Do the man justice!
Love this shit get it !!!
Tim Barth is a beast
took long enough to upload, great vid though
AWD conversion
You can literally FEEL the passion these guys have for cars! I love how the smiles on their faces grew with each tweak! Things like this make my day! Love you guys!
What does it take for me to come work with you?? You look like you have to much fun!!
Can’t you make it 4wd?
👏👽
dang
That thing sounds like momma calling the house telling us dinner’s ready🤤🤤🤤
MEEEOOOWWWW!!
People are gonna hear this thing go by and be like what the... they're going to hear the wine of the supercharger and then the whistles of the turbos and be so confused 🤣🤣🤣🤣👍
dang my guess on the last video of the first hellcat was right
About time Dude! This car is INSANE!
Weston, Just because it "CAN" be done doesn't mean it SHOULD .....NAW, forget that CRAP.!  If you CAN do it, then "Just Do It!", LOL!
Hot DAMN! Not only do you have twinsies, but you got the "legend" to tune it. Hell ya Champ!!! Time ta go chew up some road kill! 💨💨💨
I really would like to place bets on who wins …. You guys would be my pick ….. but gotta make sure the damn thing won’t haze the tires
twin turbo supercharged… hell yeah brother
💪🏻💪🏻👍🏻👍🏻
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥👿👿😈😈😈👿
Twin turbo supercharged 6.2l hemi. Omg.
Dude wait you made a monster twin turbo supercharged
0:34 how are you gonna keep the blower if your turboing it ??? This is interesting 🤔
You gotta love when you get ahold of a badass tuner like that. Makes the process so much more enjoyable
When the man says "we're going to let it cool down" you know it's going to be wicked
Westen: "hey hellion can you send us an instruction manual for those turbos?" Hellion: "we already did... theyre in the turbos" Westen: "ya, right, so the Hellcat ate the instructions" Hellion: ...
Damn took long enough :-)
Years ago I wanted to do a supercharged twin turbo, everyone told me it wasn't possible
Holy fuck now there’s a difference between a cool video and a surreal video this is fuckeddd!!
starts car        runs like an old mule  -  this is  me waking up   arrh i,m a pirate    ( like yur show bro!)  -  au🙃            HP tuners did a great job    now it  runs like a Stallion   .
You came up to my town! That car is beautiful! I don’t think my mouth closed the whole time I was watching this video!
Yeeehaawwww buddy.
The face at 9:25 is what makes this all worth it lol
I literally was thinking about doing the same kind of paint job my El Camino I'm digging it bro
What's the story about your ex worker about you screwed him over
This dude just loves his life so much! Did a lot of work to get here but damn that’s fun shit
Dude the turbo sound!!!!!!!!!!! What a nice guy to!!
Put nitrous in it
What a Beast "The Beast"
Westin, you say Illinois without pronouncing the s
This Tuner is a legend
Omg twin turbo twin charged hemi! Does it get any better? Congratulations on joining the thousand horsepower club… I might get there in 30 years lol
Shame another good channel swallowed bye add revenue and profits.
Let’s go you reached 1,000 ponies. Your in the clouds I bet
This guy right here just 860 to the tires and says moooorrre????? Sweat lord yes 😂😂
Double thumbs up. Sounds amazing.
Nice to see you doing what you love bud keep up the good work and have fun
I like this bloke !! He’s a good man
I know the time it takes, I'm starting on a 1981 Jeep CJ7 RHD with a 2.4L Isuzu engine from factory and I'm in the UK, going to take me over a year to pay for parts to be shipped here 🤣
NICE GUY!!!!
I’m so glad I found this channel back in the day. You are a legend…
This guy's smarter than frig Westen. Good guy to hook up with.
Ive been patiently waiting to see what madness you would do to this thing and DAAAMMMNN  did u deliver!
You should add nitrogen to…. Just installing a double turbo kit is not good enough! Also remove all interior and seat to cut weight and add some weight above the back axle for grip
So it basically twin charged right now
Damn Westin you have  arrived
Never seen a turbo charged/super charger on a hellcat
Yup your making history my dude 💯💪
Wait, 3 minutes in the video and I'm just realising. A super charger and twin turbos???
Mustangs over here choosing either a supercharger or turbo setup and ofc some hellcat guys were just like "YEE HAW, WHY NOT BOTH?!"
So twincharge? Hardly see that around and on yt.
“942 to the tire?” “We’re not done” best shit I’ve heard all day
Yup new dream car
Make it awd
I live 30min outside of Detroit, Chargers and challengers are the most stolen cars
It sounds so weird but hella nice😂💨
Like a Kid in a Candy Store
Supercharged, twin turbo charged, high rpm, 7 liter duramax.
Gulp!😈😈😈
Okay….. show me
I didn’t know that you could put turbos on a supercharged car
man i want more the cummins mustang
What a beassssst
Thank you for showing that memorial. That was a very sweet thing to include in the video.  Thank you for all the smiles and laughs you give everyone. We'd probably watch you play board games. That channel is you and cars are just what brings people through the door.
Honestly, I think smaller pulley, e85, bigger injectors and a 2nd fuel pump. Custom cam. U will have over 1k hp to the wheel, then add a 150 to 200 shot and ur done. Now u have money for a 15 inch rear conversion some 15 beadlocks and a fat drag tire. Then practice launch.
Tim is the man
Let me just take comments to 1000 🙂
Beyonce better be callin' now Westen!
Toooo shoorrrtty
U really need slicks on that  monster. ALSO THE GUYS A TROTTLE CALLED U OUT.GO GET EM
They’ve created a monster!
can we appreciate this man built a car for his deceased son.
I’m sorry you had to come to Illinois, my condolences.
I would love to know how the army truck ended up on its side
Stupid question. Why are dodge crushing the other car????
9:23 that growl was crazy 🐅
It sounds like a diesel with the turbo whistles
Is that a younger machine gun Kelly as your helper?
This is so dope
Is hellmacknifica
Westen: 25000 Horsepower!!?!!???  Tim: We just started.
I would love to meet this dude
Want more bulid detail video!!!! But cool.
sort of sad seeing the other one go back knowing it will get crushed .... i'd rather them be like "...eh ...AH SCREW IT ... you keep it Westen ... do whatever the hell you want with it .. .no restrictions ... just upload the video OF it and maybe if possible give someone from the company a ride in the final product :D "
That this is insane! All ya gotta do is find a way to make it hook 😂 Otherwise its just an expensive smoke machine
Can u put grippy boi slicks on it or that’s not part of the event
Love watching you dude and love what you do but please can you make the videos longer
Bro when it revs it sounds so awesome with the supercharger then the blow off with the turbos
Love it :)
Never put turbo's under a car.
Screw the billionaires, I want Tim Barth to build a rocket ship 🚀.
I had a smile while watching this entire video
Holy s**t 😳😂🤣
(Westen) It’s running. (Car) Correction: Was running.
Please start making 5xl shirts and stuff.  Dying to buy Smokestang
🙏🙏RIP TO HIS SON🙏🙏
It needs slicks or drag radials. What a fricken monster !
I would not be able to give it back. No way I d have to send them a check ☺️😉any chance we will see it at a cash days race or three b4 the roadkill event ? Might help sending the check to keep it ☺️
R.I.P. the other Charger, I totally woulda taken it 😭
Fck that firs secs hurts my ears wtf
That’s one bad ass cat 🐱
ah dude Freeport is 20mins from me. how ironic.
I have following you for 3 years and you use to show more of the process and you and your brother joked around while you were working. Now there is way too much editing, lots of nothing now. Very disappointed. In the pasted I was recommending this channel, but sad to say I am unsubscribing. Good luck to you and your family.
No matter what kind of day I'm having, Westen videos makes everything better. Dude is 100% positivity!
Don’t be silly cut towards your buddy! Never get yourself a cut again 😂
Man you're gonna kill it out there man! Can't wait to watch you in action!
Pls tell me you’re gonna get some drag radials for that car.
I’m still wondering is the SRT seriously getting sent back and crushed? Why not just sell it? Scrap parts? That is such a waste :(
i like the video before i watch it i trust its good
Why destroy the srt I would love to have one sad to see one go
I wish you made longer videos. Still keep out the fantastic work!
That my friend is officially a ferkin beast
Don’t think you can cram any more air into it
Supercharged twin turbo Nitrous sounds a lot better lol
Just to let you know I've been following along with a couple other YouTubers who are in this challenge with you along with Dodge. I think you have the most horsepower out of everybody else right now. Now just need to learn how to control it
Too eazy
This thing is awesome! Can't wait to see more content with it. Good luck at the event!
Damn are they really gonna crush that hellcat 😢
Lol imagine living in Freeport illinois and going to the fair.😂
Why would they crush it?
Like many others, I had no idea turbos and superchargers would work together.  Well done!!  Can't wait to hear/see how this all comes together.
Take a shot for every fist bump 👊 🤜🤛
9:19
Your videos need to be longer even if it's just of you guys doing shit
You don’t even hear the blower anymore 🤣🤣
The SRT team might hire you
sounds like a diesel at 12:05 lmao
put a smaller pulley on the blower
Sir I enjoy watching you videos. MAKE THEM LONGER PLEASE!! Keep up the good work.
Is this the first twin charged charger? This is the first one I've seen
Ohhhhhhhhhh snappppssssss twin turbos 👍
You need to post more man, it’s excruciatingly painful having to wait 2-3 weeks for another vid 😎, love ur vids !!
Awesome cool 🆒️😎👍
He should make it awd
👍👍👍
Well, Now you have to hook up to the track. That’ll be the hardest part.
I wonder what else he’ll do to it. Weight reduction, better fuel system, tires, pulleys? Whatever he does, it’s gonna be sick
I hope u get to keep it afterwards the car is just meant to be part of the channel
Now that’s a hellcat
Before westen gets there the tornado sirens will go off and people will say is it a tornado no its worse its westen lol 😆
1000whp, nice, you need some slicks then hook up with @Drew Peacock and run it against his mustang. If you can hang with or beat his mustang I believe you’ll win drag nights
I love how he didn’t make 5 videos on him putting the kit on SO MUCH.
Twincharged 😯
6 am in Sunny Poland, watched this before I went to work. Cheered me up no end.
Dodge- can’t change the engine or supercharger Westen- heh dual spinny bois go pshh
Fastest install over ever seen
Now you need to take it to This VS That with Hoonigan. I wanna see that!
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE UPGRADE THE SUPERCHARGER
u need wheels for the back asap before the race. seriously those wheels are NOT gunna cut it. Traction is #1. get some thicc boi tires.
Wasn't running because it wasn't tuned.
We  need more videos from you.  Can't get enough. Keep up the great work
This made me so damn happy!
It almost sounds like a diesel just cruising by lol
So twin turbo supercharged hemi v8
I was praying you were gonna do this, I am so pleasantly pleased man. I also love how you turned a Dodge Hellcat into a Grumman Hellcat! Sick paint man.
Only the best content
That short story about Tim’s son was honestly kind of sad but nice. I’ll have to drink on for him Friday since we share a birthday
fucking legend.
Western I have a question, I have a dodge Dakota Magnum year model 2000, 5 speed manual, and has the same engine from factory  and we want to put a turbo in it, we have all the stuff, I just want to know what else would we have to do to it in order for it to run right
1300?? But the Dino made 1,000 to the wheel. We talking power to the crank?
More videos please.
ITS GARRRYYYYYYYY
Now I really really really want a hell cat 😂
LOLOL!!  Westen thought his car would sound like Curly from the Three Stooges!!
When it comes time to race it please I'm on my knee's please show what others did to their hellcats I'm praying you win it
I didn’t think you could set up a gas engine like an old Detroit.   Also when is the Chevy camero powered by a cat diesel gonna happen.
What a unit Westen WOW
😁 welcome to Illinois the state of no ketchup on hotdogs and also try a place called noves it has the best beef sandwiches
that last comment was a great low blow lmao
damn you can cash some easy money the streets
Wow only $10/gal. Can you send some to me? I am in CA.
You know some shit is about to go down when the tuner goes “ah, we ain’t done”
i knew you were gonna get a turbo or two in there... i just had a feeling.
we are not done..wait what 👀👀? damn
Stick a thumb in it
Doesn’t the prototype hellcat use the bigger supercharger and makes 797 horsepower.
Nice can you do anything to the suspension? I would definitely look into that then you win.
Please make 1 hour episodes???!!!!! Ay least 33 min!
holy shit y'all are insane I love it
Man this video ended too quickly I want to see part two so badly.
Put e85 in it
No way you where in  Freeport man !!! I live like 20 minutes from there Fuckk
do you get to keep it after
That guy was amazing
When it doesn’t start straight away you know it has some crazy hp.
Supercharged twin turbo Hellcat oh that's going to be fun
Ask em if I can have that car for them not to crush it I’ll buy it
Shit!!! She’s a beast!
Anytime western mods a car it's for a good reason, mans a legend with a wrench , great video man
This dude is a genius. He’s the Einstein of car modding. Wish you can build me an Rx8 with a hemi and the 2 turbos😂😂😂.
bub i love you to death but there isn't as 's' at the end of illionios
Hope to see you at roadkill nights!
Got a Barbie ad at the end of the video. Damn it, Westen
Such a westen idea 😂
You were close by me. Should of stopped by! And saw my 1970 442 W30 Convt. I know,it’s not a Cummins.
Westen:900hp!! Tuner: BUT WAIT there’s more 😉
He said 1000hp to the wheels so is it 1300 at the crank? Or is he also counting the Nitrous? Just wondering
Plot twist: the one doesn’t get crushed and dodge is making a more bad ass one
Awesome machine.
No tool sponsor yet? If only
Aye western call them back and tell them don’t crush it bro I would be more than happy to take it off their hands for them 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
Sweet Jesus Weston is trying to go fast as a rocket
How is this guy not a freaking legend? He does legendary things and people act like it’s business as usual. He has a freaking Cummins in a Mustang people! He twin turbocharged a supercharged hellcat! This man is the king of genius ideas. Keep up the awesome legendary work Mr. Champlin, I hope this channel explodes and you can be a full time YouTuber and post multiple times a week. Plus get them deep pocketed sponsors so you can play for free and we can all enjoy the show.
Just don't let it fall of the trailer! - Tim
Super-Turbo That’s sick🤮
i'm drooling over here holy cow man!! "we're not done" lolol!!!!!!
Hp turners that dude is one of kind
He keeps saying twin turbos but what about the fact THAT ITS TWIN TWIN CHARGED second twin for the dual turbskis
I love how he said Illinois 😂 I’m from Indiana and I do that shit to piss off everyone 💀
Freaking thing sounds badass
If anyone is interested look up the ww2 p47 thunderbolt it's had a massive turbocharger blowing into a two stage supercharged 2800 cubic inch radial.aircraft from that Era kinda started all the modern performance items including nitrous and water methanol injection
I was disappointed to not see you at the srca drag strip last weekend, it made me really sad
You need some slick tires to control how much hp it’s making them stock tires not gonna do it
no better person to give a hellcat too!!! hell yeah brother
YEAAAAAAAAAH BABBYYYYYYYYYYYYY
I love this page and everything you do but stop saying illinois like that 🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️
I LOVE THE VIDEOS!!! From good ole Olathe Kansas
A twincharged hellcat.. insane.
I thought they took it back
Man the sound through the video is insane. I can only imagine how amazing it sounds in person!
Now that's a badass hellcat
Technically it is a triple charged hellcat
you should put a cummins turbo diesel badge on the smoke stang
That sucks they other hellcat is getting crushed
COMPOUND HEMI
I think you better get your hands on a tire sponsor.. you’re gunna need it.
Love the paint job!
I wish they would have let him keep that car instead of crushing it. That really makes me sad😔
Yenno you could milk this like most Channels with like a 30 min video and I wouldn’t mind it either but this a collage of so much it makes it quick and there 😭 mad respect
Freeport!?!? God damnit so close to meeting you!
Hp tuners is what I've used for better part of 15 years. Love their software and setup!!!
went to the extreme with this hellcat im so sorry for car lovers that cant find this channel
Been in the car game for 25 years and most people have no concept of what 1,000hp really is.  In many cars they are basically not driveable anymore because like he said, "you could be going 100mph and lose all traction".  Luckily that car weighs about 4600 lbs, which is heavy.  I did a 2900lbs fox body with a turbo 351 and it made 780hp.  It was insane and terrifying.  We turned it down to 600 hp so you could actually drive the thing and not die.
Great video can’t wait to see it go down the drag👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻sounds great… just make sure you don’t hurt any of them ponies… You have to put in your disclaimer that no ponies were hurt in the dragging of this hellcat. Keep the great content coming.
There going to crush this car.  Proceeds to call police stating car was stolen.  Continues build series.
Street speeds car?
That thing is fucking insane 😂.
Time for some faaaaaaat drag slicks and he’s gonna crush everyone there
Be careful, people are stealing cars like that left and right
I like the stock look what turbos
That's a good mechanic when he says " were just getting started "
Best quote ever "yeah we're not done!" This dudes the man
I just waiting for the 300 shot and some melted pistons! In all seriousness that was a Great vid/build!
I'm less than an hour from him. I got a bed with your name on it Westen
That thing is amazing!!!
So this is a Hellcat with a blower AND twin turbos You sir have just won the Internet
Hey westen, I have no intention of being hurtful or rude when I say this but I encourage you to please watch your weight. Me and so many others love your content and personality and I would hate to see you fall victim to health problems caused by obesity. Again I say this out of concern and love take care man and God bless.
“yeah were not done” the BEST words to hear😂😂
1.4 million subs congrats!!!
Yes!!!!! 1000. HP
Bro I’d love to work for this man just playing with cars making them better hell yeah
THIS WAS AWESOME!!!💪🏻🇺🇸❤️ i’m so pumped for the next video! That old man knows what he’s doing👍🏻
It’s officially on there!  Bolt falls
Should of told dodge I'll keep it safe for ya
I saw him at a holiday Inn he was like pull out ur flashlight and look under the car, damm twin turbo. And what a nice dude.
Excellent music choice!
I love you no homo thooo
RIP transmission and differential
You read my mind in was thinking put a massive turbo on then put 40lb of air through it car make mo powa baby
Is it just "stock" with a couple turbos? That's fucking insane and is definitely the best sounding dodge out there
Been on your page for 3 days straight looking for this video
1000 HP and no zip ties ? What could have you got for HP with zip ties
Love how on the thumbnail it’s says my area code 717
I spit my drink when Westen brought the table into frame at the 0:58 mark.  🤣🤣🤣
Where’s the ex police car that was supposed to get the built 6.4 twin turbo
Western this is amazing thanks for letting me be apart of it!!!!!!
That’s a bad ass ride.
supercharger and a turbo sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeshhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Hey are the catalytic converters for sale I need those 🙋‍♂️
Barth is a hell of a tuner I love the part he says we are not done.
Stop teasing and give it up 😂
I love how westen just goes incognito for a couple weeks at a time then bang crazy shit happened while we were gone
What a fucking monster
It’s crazy to watch how much you’re video quality has improved, good work
Is that car actually gonna get crushed??
Twin turbo supercharged 1k hp to the wheels. Yes!
dual charged (twin turbo and supercharged)
I’m shocked that the stock motor can run that must boost with out any issues!
I think the problem was back pressure from not have exhausts
We are not done yet.. Till the next video.
That one needs a cage
GM: we’re going all electric  Ford: we will be carbon neutral in 5 years. Dodge: *sniff a kilo of Peruvian powder* “LOL MORE GAS FOR US”
Coming to Detroit to build a honda for a guy and wanna meet you! Only gonna be 30 minutes from Woodward where I used to live!
How the fuck is the transmission holding that power 😂
rust to riches needs to be fired
hek yeah
Remember when you used to show you building the cars? Now half the point of watching this channel is gone.
Westen has a Kevin. But for a hemi. If ya know ya know
It’s not IllinoisSsSsss! There’s only one! 🤦🏻‍♂️
Suspension and tires ....
Dang
Next stop Walmart for tires.   😀
Can’t wait to see ya up here! The events gonna be crazy. The M1 has came a long way in the past 6 months
I didn't hear the 1300hp to the wheel announcement, but I'm pulling for you to win this deal! Do you actually get to keep it after the event? If so we should get it protected for ya😉
Sorry but you did what?
Another bangger..
Wow westen that's some car.
Does your new partner know he’s only allowed to appear in like 5 videos then he has to disappear forever with no explanation? Awesome videos. Keep up the good work.
oh hell yeah!
That guy looks happy he must charge out the ass.
It's still supercharged lol
What’s hanging off the back defuser of these cars???
Yeah this is def gapping throtl LOL
I didn’t know you could strap a turbo with a supercharger let alone TWO! This Hellcat is a true beast. Well done Westen on this accomplishment 👍
Bout damn time someone twin charhed a hellcat
This guy kicks ass
Jesus loves you
Westen put 2 superchargers on it and nos
If you see this comment and you don't sub to this man, you're killing the vibe. I don't have to convince you why you should, but compare him to the people you ARE subscribed to. He's just better.
There’s no “noise” in Illinois.  Thank you.
That Mopar man is a mad scientist! His sons tribute car is beautiful.
That's funny I live in Freeport 🤣🤣Florida
It needs a two step.
Leave me a way to get a hold of you
Weston please reply back I have a great idea for keeping ur idts cool n cantor the temp Of the engine
Mechanics love and hate him.
Anyone else catch a peek at the tires when it was on the lift 😅😅
that tuner guy made a monster and when weston asked if it was fast...he realized what the car was in for
Supercharger whine and turbo stututututu. Perfect.
When you bottom out and take the turbos off lol
Prediction: 40 years from now there will be a story about how the Westin Champlin Hellcat escaped the crusher and has just been discovered.
All I gotta say is… WOW
Those stickers gave +15hp
My heart skipped a beat when I heard that turbo and super charger
I dare you to put a livery that pisses off people
That is AWESOME
4:41 thats basically murder wtf
Hellcat: makes turbo noises Westen: happy monkey noises
Happiness level: Westen 9:24
Hellion was a great choice
4:40 this pisses me off. what a waste of a perfectly good car. it's not even broken.
You finally up loaded a video
I was hoping someone would compound one of them.  This is badass, hopefully you found a dot slick that will help you get some traction.
Did you rip out all the air conditioning and luxury parts?
Is that dual turbos with a supercharger on top?  Tasty.... but... you crazy...
I never knew supercharged and twin Turbo in a car was even a thing???
Pretty sick brother! It’s the first hellcat I’ve seen with twin turbos added to it. Can’t wait to see what it does on the track 💪🏻👍🏻
your a fuckin mad man westin lol fuckin love the car good shit
cleetus would like to know about the location of the bald eagles. i dub this car the hell eagle
That looks fun
-  👍 👍 🔧  -
You should make a shirt like Kentucky Ballistics: Just Put A Thumb In It! Yours should say Just Put A Screwdriver In It!
Twin charged 🤌🏽🤌🏽🤌🏽🤌🏽🤌🏽🤌🏽🤌🏽🤌🏽🤌🏽
Bro this dude is smart i had the same idea why not twin turbo a hellcat
I got ear rapped
Should go find streetspeed717 and race his zo6. I think that would be awesome race
You have came a long way since 35k subs. That's when I subbed. Keep it up!
Sounds crazy
Freeport Wish I'd known you were up here Would have loved to meet you
i dont understand why that other one needs to be crushed
Westen went to Dr. Frankenstein; What you didn't want a monster??
https://fb.watch/7iUpaE_xTH/
Bro that things a beast! Barth is the man, seems like a really cool guy. I want one now, lol.
Forget about the turbo have u seen homies Mullet???
Too easy
I prefered your videos back in the early days when you took old junk and made it work.  What happened to that Ford tractor that you went and got?  What happened to those old trucks that you bought and fixed up?  What happened to the other Mustang that you bought?  You bought what became the Smokestang to use as a parts car...what happened to the other Mustang?  What about the Army truck?  What about the Bulldozer?  What about that other tractor?  Where's Bob?  Building the Smokestang was cool.  Rebuilding the Raptor including swapping the frame was cool.  Building the Fummins was cool.  Rebuilding the Peterbuilt was cool.  Your videos of showing off with all your new toys?  Not nearly as cool as the older videos.  I'm sure you're having fun and you've got a lot of subscribers, but the content that built your channel is vastly different than the content you're producing now.  This isn't the same channel that I started watching.  You were redneck cool in the beginning, now you're like one of the rich kids of Instagram that's just showing off.  On a scale of 1-10 the Smokestang build was a 10.  The Smokestang videos at the drag strip are a 2; not entertaining and barely watchable.  Please Westen, bring back your good content.
That engine is not long to this world 🤣
What the Crazy!!! 67% more HP from bolt on parts and a tune? Mr. Barth certainly knows his stuff.
Dude that shit was sickk
That turbo sounds wicked bro 😂🔥👌
One of the best comments Westen “wait what? We have 942hp at that the rear tires!” The tuner “ya we’re not done yet” Legendary! 🤣🤣
8 13  my birthday to brother.
We would have know how much work it took if you bothered to record and post the videos.
Put dragslicks on it
Good job buddy take care
Bad to the bone!
love this guy holy shit
Next video: adding a rear engine supercharged Cummins to the twin turbo hellcat
What I’ve been waiting for!! Goodluck brother!
Just for future reference. Put you some Vaseline on rubber hoses or rubber intake stuff. Makes it go on WAY easier
I need to hear this beast in person, it's gotta be awesome
Wow, you can fit twin turbos in a hemi engine-bay?  ....engine bay?
How is no one saying to this guy has a trx 100k truck
Gah Damn!!
Will this car stick around after this roadkill event?
Thats fucking badass
Love all of your content. That charger is sick as hell and I believe you have inspired me to Cummins swap my 80 trans am. (Enter evil laugh here)
Why did they have to repo the other car and why is it being crushed?
"Just don't let it fall off the trailer"  "Oh..shit"  Classic Westen ending  🤣🤣
Freeport is just down the road from me. Wish I had known you were there.
I'm starting to think Westen might have a kink for turbos
How long before the EPA kicks down Westen's door for "defeating emissions equipment"....
4x4 hellcat
Needs better suspension now
This is so awesome!
I need this car the turbos sounded absolutely amazing
Tim said yeah we're not done 🤣🤣😂😂
For THE LOVE OF GOD I'm 31 years old and you just gave me surprise when said MY town FREEPORT IL. Its a small shit hole makes no sense to me LOL never have seen or heard of him was INSANE to see u here wish would of knew been cool to meet ya
Wut a fire breathing monster can’t wait to see u guys run them!!
A great tuner WITH a dyno is a must. Especially if they have your back and ready for the data logs. Props to him and his expertise with HP Tuners. (I'm assuming that's what he's using, given all the advertisements) Heck ya man!   I'm not going to address my feelings for that first car and the crusher, not cool. I've got 2 dodges that won't quit. Sad day. I'd pay for it, but its probably too late.
You are my favorite YouTuber and like I said you’re gonna pass up whistlin diesel! Love the vids
This thing is a monster... we're not done yet. Hahaha
That car gonna give me nightmares
Why would dodge smash that new car ?
You sick S.O.B...!!!! Making a monster!
5:55 when your friends triple dog dare you but you try to back out.
suspension , axels, gears, slicks. you should be ready.
man said over 900 hp but were not done😂 mans an absolute legend
f ya lets go!!!
Tim is and AWESOME guy
so do you get to keep the car after the race also
Wait I'm confused I thought all hellcats were supercharged stock? Did he twin turbo a supercharged hemi?
Looks like Tavarish got one too. The competition is stiff!
Should have pro charge the Hemi for better short track
7 bucks a gallon  is still cheaper than Canadian regular fuel.... Damm
Watching this video i was like Freeport Illinois FREEPORT ILLINOIS THATS RIGHT DOWN THE ROAD
What a Beast
Please tell me this is going to be 4WD
I lived in Freeport Illinois then I moved to NewYork Syracuse
oh. im in love.
How far are you from Freeport🤔
Fucking insane
🤣🤣🤣 I love this channel Weston is so fun
Those turbos sound more like a supercharger
*You may be a maniac, but your ours.*
This this is gonna eat them boys at throttle
When are you going to put some meat on the back?
My money is on Alex Taylor mopping up.
I live in Freeport ya'll should've called!
Hellyah twincharging FTW
Y is it going to be crushed
Please learn to pronounce "Illinois".
Dont let it fall off the trailer...lol
Love the number. 717
I literally love how calm they both are while saying “ oh it’s fast”
His reactions of joy and happiness are pure and legit. That’s what makes this content the best on YouTube. 💯💯
Win or kill it trying!!!
But the bad thing of it is after it's all over with you don't get to keep it the cars going to be crushed.
Twin twirly boys!!!!!
Not sure how well it would work but I’ve heard of nitrous being added to your setup.
Did ya even plug the alternator back up lol Tim knows his stuff he don’t even needa crack up the hood
It's true the that Hell well suck the air out of anything. Watch the fan. Lol
lol i love you bro … BALD EAGLE ALERT !! this bad mamma jams need to go to the freedom factory !
EV pisses all over it.
What haping to the  mustang 2017.?
Now that you have the power you need to get the right tires to help it hold the road.
"Jus dont let it fall off the trailer" lmao
i hear that two steps from hell, it cant get by me
You getting big meaty tires for the hellcat?
HELL YEA BAD ASS!!!
💯💯% Need more content lol great vids keep it up Guys
Love seeing this dude smile! It's contagious! Definitely going to order some merch!
He said just don’t let it fall off the trailer western says aaaa sh$t
Turbo the hell out of the hellcat
Nothing much is better than happy westen noises 😂
Turbo the hell out of the hellcat
OMG  90 stab it and it brakes loose now that would be fun to drive.
Dodge : don't take the supercharger off Westen: so hemi I heard  you  liked boost for your boost
the first start the hellcat sounded like donald duck or daffy for that matter
At the end "don't let it fall off the trailer".......his facial expression seems like hes talking from experience lol
Looks great but the s is Silent in Illinois
I need it!!
Holy crap that thing is  fast
😂I thought the car started at 5:27 when Westin snorted 💀
Dang you be going fast now 🦅🦅🦅🇺🇸💪😁👍
Nice to have you in my neck of the woods.  Born and bred. Stop back up more often.
That is so freaking awesome!?
I smack my aunt in the face everytime you post
OMG!, I thought you were in jail or something Westen, just kidding,  it's about time you made a new video, not kidding, LOL!
If western doesn't win the competition
It didn't run right because it's a dodge
Badass!!
I'm from Freeport, I had no idea this place even existed. Was kinda taken back for a minute when you said you came to Freeport, theres like no reason to come here so its something I don't hear every day LOL
20 bucks to say he blows it up
Hell Yeah
I just smile whenever I see Westen post.
Yup that is exactly what I would do to the dodge charger. So cool and it sliver.
wow
Sequential clutch maybe?
Does @Tavarish know what he is up against? For this challenge?
Definitely needs a pair of slicks!!!
There are no words except " fuck". This is insane
Atleast it's actually twins this time and not compound turbos he calls twins 😂😂
2 weeks for a 13 min video.  Come on man. Put a few more out than that.   Awesome choice on the hemi. Keep em coming
That tuner was awesome!
I've been waiting for this video
westin is too powertful
Needs drag slicks like the smoke stang lmao
Put a Radial engine in a old ford f150
Twin turbos on a supercharged hemi......yeah buddy! 👍
Seeing that bad boy on the dyno, seeing that legend getting it set up and running right, made me happy and smile so I know westen is super happy
I CALLED THIS ON THE FIRST VIDEO I SAID YOU SHOULD FEED A TURBO INTO THE SUPERCHARGER
Sickest Hellcat out there!! 👀🥵🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
That thing sounds sick.. Turbos was like a dang jet screaming by...nice work brother
Awesome video
twin turbo + a supercharger + a churro XD ... the Dodge Churro LOL
It's sucking in so much air, the cooling fan starts bugging out hahahaha
So it’s a super turbo
WINNER 🏆
Vacuum leak? “Put a thumb in it” ~Kentucky Ballistics
Very impressive!
Hey! Whats wrong with zipties?!
Can we make the videos longer again like the old days
Tim Barth: "Don't let it fall off the truck."  Something tells me he's seen your videos, lol!
Fastest twin turbo install video 😂
You should call it the Hellhound after the three head dog of the devil. (Cerberus)
Just heads up the S in Illinois is silent
I feel bad that you had to go to freeport il.  Make sure you shower when you leave
Why would they crush it
I think he should get to keep it
You are an evil genius and I like it
For real, what kind of job do you have to where you have all this money and time on these projects and let me know if your job is hiring
You were down by my old hometown and I would have love to meet you.
Its nice FCA can give these Hellcats out for free!!!!  Wonder when they will need another bailout???
I see the ram trx in the background
Do you get to keep the kitty after? Cause if you put the interior in then you’ll probably have the fastest 4 door sedan on that side of the Mississippi river
I can't wait to see this on TVI just need to know when Western you  Kick their asses and as much as I love roadkill I want you to show them who's boss
What was leaking on the driver side front at the 4:13
you need better tires.
Wait why did we crush the charger smh
You wont be able to get that much power to the ground due to traction issues.  How are you fixing that?
😮😮😮😮😮😮
So let me get this straight, you put twin turbos on a already supercharged motor?
I live like five minutes from Freeport
Roll cage and drag slik tires to find true spirit of this beast you created
I enjoy your show. Cool. I live on the Navajo reservation and I wish I could meet you  guys.  I have cancer stage 4. And  fighting for past 3 years now.  My b you  could  fix my rides . Because thy are giving up on me. Can't fix it myself anymore.  Thank you for your time
Don't let it fall off the trailer 😭
That is bad now you need some sticky tires.
What a car..
This dude was in freeport and I had no idea. I'm pissed.
Wait is it double boosted ?
My uncle was the one with the red turbo camaro at Mokan and she spun and got sideways pretty good stock so I can only imagine now😂😂 good luck brother
Hell yeah 🤣😀 I'm i
Wow he added turbos. What a surprise
See hellcat damn that's cool, hears turbos and supercharger 😳
More videos and more in depth please. Love your videos and content
duel charge it both turbo and super charge it
SKRRRRRRT
Who else from Illinois cringe when he says illinoisss
Sickest sounding hellcat I’ve heard . Honestly didint know you could run twin turbos with a supercharger 😂 insane
Your show has gone from a nowhere place to legend racing tech shop and Dodge wanting to see what you can do. Very Cool
Best one yet
I had no idea you could have a supercharger and a turbo on a car 🤯
why is that SRT getting crushed?  You need to save it from the Crusher Westen maybe recruit the help of Hoovie lol
Need to see this car everyday
Miss you guys more vids faster
Let's go!!!
I've been waiting for this!!
Herse pers
banger
Don't let it fall off the trailer   Speaking of that my brother and I were driving through town and a rollback wrecker went by with a car on it but only 3 wheels were on the deck
twin turbos ?!?!
You finally back been a while
405 / Big Chief ! Could be a good race ..
I need one.
Only in the Med-West Baby! Grats job.
Western the feckin champ, I rate the come up for this geezer, I’m glad he’s getting the recognition from companies to pursue his dreams, and provide us the entertainment on his journey, much love big man 💪
bad ass man u amaze me everytime
🔥🔥🔥
F--KING EPIC...& he's got a cool car too!
I'm 330 in comments
It's "L-in-noy"  the s is silent. 🙂
Seeing this makes us poor hemi owners dream big
Power of the horses to the tire!!!!
its weird hearing him swear
Please oh please go race streetspeed717!
Mod2fame take notes☝
Horse power!!!!
I love you man keep up the work and I wish I could meet you
did that shit fr have a supercharger and twin turbos??
Don't forget to change the oil.
RIP to the mans son 8-13. days away
He’s back!!!!!!! Westen love the videos 😉
There is only one Illinois.  The s is silent.
Can’t wait to see the Hellcat Redeye builds at the Roadkill event🤟
That thing sounds so good, I wouldn't even want to drive it, I would just want to start it and let idle and turn it off. Flipping scary.
Good video westen, I have a suggestion i dont even know if dodge would let you but put not one but Two Nitrous bottles on the charger. :)
Have to keep the supercharger?!?!🤔
I think the best advice I could give is for you to go to the Peak Auto YouTube channel and see the video that Emily from Sparks Garage does.  Alix Taylor goes through what she is doing to her car and I guessing  , Tavarish, Throttle and yourself better step up your game because Alix and her Dad Dennis are on top of their game for this one.  Good Luck! I am cheering for you!
👍👍
Now all it needs is some nitrous !!! Then it will have all the “ Go Fast” stuff. 😂😂😂
Looks ready for deteoit brother! It will be sweet to see so many of you guys and your hellcats here soon
This dude
I love it
Dude I'm not a dodge guy but that car is nice
Be sure to take the Smoke Stang as backup and you have built a beast.
Love the fact that it's dual charged. Ok, bet you got Mod2fame scratching his head. A+ video man!!
I’ve always wondered if you can turbo a supercharger but DAMN WESTON HAD TO 1 UP ME.. with twins
Its all fun and games till there's a turbo shortage cuz of westen
Make it awd so you can't start a burnout at 100mph
Why haven’t you liked this comment
Alex has removed almost all the interior and the metal trunk. they are rebuilding that car from front to back. She will be your challenge.
slicks pls
😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲
Good luck doing this with Ford or Chevy :DDD THATS WHY MOPAR!
@Westen Champlin  *they said we had to keeo the supercharger, so we twin turbod it too*  *next video: installing a jet engine into our super-twincharged hellcat*
You should put Helium in the tiers will take away about 14 pounds off a tier and give you about 40 more hp
What happened to the 379?
Come on maaan we need a way longer video of the hellcat , this thing deserves a 2 hour special video
Hey!!
<3<3<3<3
Your content has really stepped up another level since I started watching 2 years ago.
Finally a new video yessssss!!!!!!
That tuner was a cool dude
Awesome work @Westen!  Love how you give credit where due. What tires will you be using?
Westin you are going to shake up the house this is going to blow the other guys out off the race
It’s crazy, earlier today, I said to myself that I haven’t seen a Westen video in awhile.  I go on break at work, and here’s a video!!  Thank you good sir!!!  Keep em coming
As much as I love the car I would say it's scares me a bit 1300hp without a roll cage and other race safety items
“Yeah, it’s fast”
All I can say is HOLY Fuck !!!!!! .  Got to be honest, I’ve driven some animal cars, this would scare the Shit out of me !! Feel the same Westen ??? God Bless America 🇺🇸 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸  We’re taking “ Our “ Country Back !!!👊🏻  PS.. Have you met Derek from VGG? You two building something together would be insane !!!
that tuner is the real car enthusiast. god bless him
Slept a few times in the pickup getting farm equipment out of Iowa. It's a weird feeling of lack of sleep and excitement. Great car!
Stay safe buddy don’t wreck it before the race lol thanks for everything brother
What race? And who all's gonna be in it? I noticed other youtubers including Tavarish were given chargers also..
Hell Yeah compound boost Hellcat!!! Now you have to hook up and not break it.
Sweet!🙏🏻🇺🇸
Time for new wheels and tire lol
Did that man say over 1000 HP???
I have never seen a twincharged Hellcat before, pretty cool
253 I love you channel btw
Well this notification made my day better. Need more of this!
GO SUPPORT THE ONE AND ONLY LEGENDARY WESTEN CHAMPLIN BY HITTING THAT LIKE BUTTON AND SUBSCRIBE !!!!!!! DO IT FOR AMERICA !!!!!!
Don’t let it fall off the trailer. He must know Westin pretty good. 😂😂😂😂
When u let the thing idle it went blub blub blub blub blub
Damn if i new u were in the area i had extra beds u an ur crew could have slept in instead of sleeping in the car
3:16 penetration
I’m surprised they wouldn’t sell that SRT8 to you Westen. Instead of crushing it.
Up 22 min and 18k views. Go Westen!
YES, I said this was going to happen in the other Hellcat Videos I knew it!
Can't wait to see it kick everyones ass this weekend
imagine what quad turbos would run like in the car
Too bad it's not AWD.
this video has some good b-roll and editing, whatever has changed it looks good!
Big Ups LDUNM !
I love westerns videos soooo much😩😂
People who gave thumbs down still believe that a huge goofy wing on a Civic improves handling.
That thing sounds so good
Thanks boys!
Tavarish is late to the party.
That's the best sounding hellcat I've ever heard.
Did you say that an't going anywhere, when you strapped it down?
Definitely in need of some sticky tires , gonna be  a beast , good luck 👍
Bro, love it.  It's been too long,  seems like a month.  We need all the videos
TT HellKitty Dayum!
LOL, loved the ending lines
Super cool
hell yeah
So u took off the supercharger?
Where did the 1300 come in? I heard 1004hp lol... badass none the less though... keep it up brother... but im for real I live 30 minutes away let me know if you need a stunt double or camera man or gopher... I mean I'm only 5ft 6 195lbs... but surely we can make me a double with some camera magic!
Just need to toss some nitrous on it, and she’s got all her bases covered 🤣
Happy to see ya doing yo thang Westlin! Keep those wheels spinnin and I’ll keep singin!
Last words, “Don’t let it fall of the trailer “
So much freedom
Westen I'm right by Freeport should have stopped in lol
An absolute must have.
Westen you need to take the cop car to him and get it dialed in …
I wish I had the money and talent to do this kind of stuff to a car!!! Good job 👍👍👍
I love how he isn’t just diesel swapping everything but I would love to see a other flummings build like the gold old days
Badass brother
Are they at least letting y'all keep the drivetrain before they crush them?
It may not look it from the video but this car took quite a bit of time/work to build. If we somehow we end up winning this Roadkill nights event John (Hellion) and  Tim (Barth Tuning) deserve a hell of a lot of the credit helping making this thing possible. Special thanks to them!
Hell yeah, A twincharger!!!!!!! Now watch it blow up
Twin turbskies supercharged Hellcat, Dude you're a fucking legend!
From now on u gotta call it the hell kitty
Bruh you know he’s legit happy when you see them dimples
Let’s get it!
Gets nitrous, wastes it blowing dust off lights. Fuck yeah Weston. Love how you keep it real. Love the builds. Love your enthusiasm. Your work speaks for itself. 👍🏼
Hell ya
this is awesome!
👍😁👍
MOTHER OF GOD!!!!!
This a going to dominate on the drag strip no doubt
HP TUNERS 👍 NICE JOB
Awesome video!
Hell yea
DAM 1300
“Just don’t let it fall off the trailer.” - Spoken like a true father.

Hell yeah now it's time to kick some ass👍👍👍👍👍
Absolutely fucking insane!!! But I still love it. 😀

He seemed like a cool dude! 🙂👍
That ending… 😂 classic Westen! Hellcat twin turbo is awesome and so is Barth.
🤤🤤🤤😳🤤🤤🤤👌🏻. Damn!!!

Westen is a mad scientist and I love it 😂🤘🏻🇺🇲
Put a locomotive turbo in the smoke stang
Awesome 😎
DONT CRUSH THE OLD HELLCAT ILL TAKE IT
Bro what a beast
Tavarish is going to have to step it up.
The sound that thing makes is absolute insanity
Westen: in awe about the car making 900+hp Tuner: yeah, we're not done 😂
Do you have to give the car back to dodge when your done playing with it?
And they say money can’t buy happiness....... I call bull shit
That's crazy!!! I'm missed the videos!! Keep them coming!
I can't wait to see this beast beat Freddy's hellcat.👊👊👊
My grandma passed away😞😞
941 hrsprs “we’re not done”
I was just thinking hmm where has Westen been and boom here he is
Love the content! Watching Westen every time Literally made my day🤣🤣
Isn't it a $10k budget? 😂 that turbo kit is $8k lol what about wheels, tires, suspension
