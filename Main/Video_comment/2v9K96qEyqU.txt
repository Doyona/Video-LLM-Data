ok
My dad is gonna have surgery on his shoulder when he wake up he will probably acting like nothing happened
I’ve spoken up in the middle surgery😂 when I was getting my cap
Why did he use a picture of Trump's daughter's husband?
NOT THE LULU LEMON BAG💀💀💀😭😭😭😂😂😂😂😂😂
New fear unlocked
It happened to me. They quickly put me back under
i know that will never happen to me, im a heavy sleeper.
I was also woke up in the middle of surgery of apendix, the exact time was around when the doctor was stitching me. Still remember when I opened my eyes, and all of them stop and looking at me, and the main surgeon said "Oh you already woke up? Are you feeling any pain?" And I was replied no i feel nothing just dizzy. I think it was from the anesthesia. Then they keep on the surgery and i just need to stitch you up a little bit😂😂😂
people who wake up during surgery can't move. They here or see stuff.
I had my gallbladder removed yesterday, and I woke up in the middle of it, and started freaking out because I could legit feel every single bit of it and it hurt like hell. Now I'm all bruised up more than I would have been, and this is the absolute worst recovery pain I've ever felt in my entire life. I'm struggling so bad with it. The meds aren't doing anything, they gave me some of the weakest pain meds to go home with, and not even very many of them.   While I was in the hospital they were giving me 6mg morphine which helped a bit, but then they switched it out for 6mg Dilaudid and that helped a lot. Then they send me home 4 hours after the surgery with 20 5/325 hydrocodone pills. Which are literally not even touching the pain at all, even when combining them with naproxen or ibuprofen. Ugh  . . . Needless to say, I've had a very long few days
I woke up in the middle of my wisdom teeth extraction today. Not fun
My sister woke up while having a oxygen mask going down her throat
Why in a Lululemon bag that’s literally so hot hilarious😮😮😢😢😢😮
Yeah it's not a true story if you are carrying your own intestines in a bag you would be dead within minutes
Omg
You kinda look like Glenn from The Walking Dead 🤨
Player 456
I woke up at the very end of a procedure as a kid that required me to be under general anesthesia. I woke up crying for my mom and my pants 😂 I was really unhappy I didn’t have pants on
Surgeons are heros
I've woken up during two out of four surgeries(that I know of). I felt nothing, and they told me beforehand that if I did wake up I wouldn't remember it. I did. I repeated things I heard them say, and was told it was accurate. But again, I felt NOTHING. I couldn't move, but I wasn't scared. It was like a dream, sort of, except it turned out to be real.     Don't worry- I also have a friend who woke up during surgery and remembered it, but also felt nothing and wasn't scared. I was told it was unusual, but not super uncommon. I was told people just rarely remember it.
Once i woke up just after the surgery ended. That was Very lucky for me
What
They must have terrible security if they jsut let a man bleeding out with his intestines hanging everywhere
What is colen
They let him out the hospital incredible
Whale up??😂
Why was I awake??
He would be dead he would bleed out
I have woke up during surgery.
I woke up in the middle of a surgery on my leg.  I remember feeling a push pull feeling on my leg, then hearing a hammering, and drilling as the were putting a plate in my leg.  I remember thinking how odd it was as I stared up at the ceiling. Then I heard the surgeon say in a shocked expression:  "She's awake!!" And as quick as that they put me under again.
The way my jaw groped
This was my nightmare when I had my surgery,  and they just laughed at me for even thinking it could have been 😅 Glad I didn't
I can visually see my intestines when I want. Or part of it and I am awake fully.
Oh I woke up during a surgery when I was a kid. I was knocked out so they could sew my pinky finger back on. waking up really wasn't a big deal. I had anesthetic, and couldn't feel anything. They stopped working until I was asleep, again. I was groggy. It's not like hopping up and instantly awake.
I once woke up and stayed away for half of my surgery. I couldn't feel anything but I couldn't fall back asleep. I have severe anxiety and having people over me freaked me out
I got up twice during my biopsy. All I said was "I can feel that" as they were making an insicion. Than they put me under. I got up again and said the same thing. I heard the doctor say "Why is she getting up?". It was so hilarious. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I haven’t woken up before but my dentist was getting rid of cavities for me and I could feel everything it was really deep as well but I was to pussy to say that it hurt like hell
i woke up during my very first surgery (and thanks to this even also my very last surgery) thankfully i was still paralysed and couldn't feel anything, only issue was that i could see everything. My eyelids were ever so slightly open so i could look at the lamp that was shining on me (which is most definitely brighter than the sun, i swear that shit was some new shade of white) I could also see the docs cutting around in my face with bloody tools, which was like a 4k resolution VR slasher movie ! (lovely)  Anyway, i was like 3 so i couldn't have made this shit up (i would've simply lacked the visual representation of such events to have it replay in my head. all i knew were flowers and rainbow shitting unicorns, masked people with bloody scalpels were a new experience to say the least).  I was probably small enough to just move on with my life and accept what happened but i to this day refuse to trust in anaesthesia because i do not wish to see episode two of a surgical procedure from a first person POV (yall can get my tickets tho, id be glad to give em away)
Actually he said what happens if you wale up during surgery
My library teacher woke up in the middle of her surgery-
Stop it that's my worst nightmare when I had surgery I told the anesthesiologist I am not kidding you. Number one nobody knows spacing out number to no cigarette breaks number 3 you give me the right amount of medicine to keep me out but not too much so I throw up when I wake up but not too little so I wake up in the middle of the surgery the Mans still probably telling everybody about the insane lady
😯
I woke up during my colonoscopy. It was dark and I heard the doctor tell me not to worry, he was going to give me some more meds. I went right back to sleepy land. I also ended up working in his office a couple of years later. 😂
I woke up during surgery. I had to inhale a gas to sleep. The doctor didn't warn me before putting the mask on my nose. I was exhaling. I got only a little bit of gas before passing out. I had no time to say anything. I remember opening my eyes laying on my back and a blurry woman above me said "he's waking up!". I immediately got the mask again and I feel asleep until the end of the surgery. I was 5 or 6.
Any reason why Jared Kushner is in this🤣🤣
Wouldn't his intestines be contaminated?
WHY DID HE RUN OUT THO?-
Kushner isn't a colon. A colon is useful.
Bro he said wale up you can't Read how are you a doctor
My friend wasn't given enough anaesthesia for a dental thing and felt almost the whole procedure but was to scared to say anything
Ooooo HELL NO THIS IS MY WORST NIGHTMARE I have been needing surgery like every 2 years
WOW
😳😳😳😳 omg.
What!!!?!!!
just knock me tf back out please 😩
My mom had to have back surgery. For some reason, she didn't get enough anesthesia or something... I don't fully understand what happened. She woke up and the nurse and doctor noticed and kept giving her medicine to knock her out. But she could feel everything and she still has night terrors sometimes. She said it was torture and it was unwillingly. They didn't mean for it to happen, but I couldn't imagine being able to feel them cutting into me and fusing my spine together. She winds up having to have another back surgery and went to a different doctor this time. They were able to knock her out completely for the 2nd one. I couldn't imagine. Then I found out that this supposedly happens to a few hundred ppl bc their bodies don't react to the meds like the rest of the population does. Just 😲 wow.
There was one where the anesthesiologist forgot to give the guy the numbing gas and gave him the paralysis one and the guy felt 16 mins of them cutting and pulling on his skin and so when they finally realized he was awake and felt everything. they gave him a medicine  that would make him forget everything so he wouldn't sew them  and a few weeks after his surgery he started screaming randomly and said they were gonna kill him and nobody knew what happened and he ended up not making it through this and y'know killed himself and then they finally figured out what happened and sewed the hospital very sad
I woke up during bone surgery, it was hilarious and I just laughed and went back to sleep
Lulu lemon bag perfect
I woke up in the middle of my ear surgery and my doc said I was lying and it's impossible. I'm still traumatized
this wins the award of the weirdest thing i’ve heard today 🏆🥇
“How many times did you rewatch to just imagine the pain”-  “Yes”
"wale up"  *stare intensifies*
This actually happened tho... basically this dude woke up and he could feel everything but couldn't move or speak. He went through hours of excruciating pain
How he had mention a Lululemon bag QuEeN💅🔫
ah yes "wale up"
I remember this happening to me when my limbs are getting chopped off my organs being pulled off and my arms being chopped off also and then my head being chopped off by a butcher knife and then i woke up and then mom said you're having a nightmare 😂
I started flapping my hand and ended up punching someone in the crotch! The last words I heard were, Oh shit, she's waking up, put her down! I've never been so grateful to wake up before!
😳
😱
How do y'all wake up from that shit 😭i woke up after surgery and kept passing out in the car and at the store and home
I woke up while having leg surgery asked everyone what they where doin
my dad woke up during a surgery once and remembers it, he remembers that he freaked out and then was put under again, he was getting a nerve in his heart lasered i believe bc his heart beat irregularly
Scary!
Y would he run out of a hospital and returning with his organs in a lulu lemon bag. Thats just weird
I dont think I should be laughing 💀😟
Am I the only one that noticed that it was Jared kushner's anus he was insinuating
Why is there a picture of Jared Kushner President Trump's son-in-law
There’s a massive difference between general and twilight. Yes, twilight you could potentially wake up. I’ve been there and it scared the 💩out of me. General, not yet!
"wale up"
What happens if you wake up in the middle of surgery. *Sigh* "Hey drug him more please!"
I woke up in the middle of my carpal tunnel surgery and screamed at the top of my lungs from the pain.
Unbelievable 🤦🏻‍♀️
if i woke up in the middle of surgery id just ask for 5 more minutes
I woke up during my tonsillectomy
is that donald trumps son in law?
Im also woke up in middle of surgery And it seems to be normal🥴
My aunt woke up one time during surgery but she couldn’t move or talk, but she could hear everything the doctors were saying. So when the surgery was over she told the doctor and he was like no that’s not possible and then she told him what he was talking about when he was having his conversation and it scared the crap out of him.
Awake during surgery = lottery
I think that is cip
The fact that there are numerous people in the comments who claim to have experienced this is unnerving
How tf was he still walking-
Its OK if u wake up go back to sleep
Eu já acordei no meio da cirurgia, mas n senti nada então só fiquei parada e esperei o anestesista notar. Na verdade eu queria era ver a cirurgia mas tinha um pano na frente
I have waken up in every procedure I had I sat up they slap u down so fast and pump them meds in passed back out but my tolerance is crazy can’t take regular meds even strong meds don’t last in my system as they should it causes so much anxiety when having procedures done
What if the thing doesn’t make you sleepy
Hi
I don't know if this applies but I can hear and see everything during surgeries. It is as if I rise out of my body and hover over the table. The doctors are aware of this issue and call it a form of disassociation. I heal much faster without all of the usual drugs used. I am also anaphylactic to all locals aesthetics and have used hypnosis along with valium for minor surgeries.
How did he not die??
I remember waking up while I was having my wisdom teeth removed and I heard the cracking of my teeth in my jaw as they were sectioning the tooth 🤢
they really be used for everything 😭
I did wake up during an appendectomy when I was 21. All I know is they asked if I remembered waking up, did I remember pain, and it was 10 years later when I requested a copy of my medical records and found in the report it said I woke up but had no memory of it and was rapidly sedated again. They also had something referencing a document  that wasn’t in my records and found out it was a form documenting the poor actions of a doctor unwed in the military. And something to do with the anesthesiologist fell asleep during surgery causing me to wake up. But it’s not like you’d remember anyways, that stuff causes amnesia effects.
Um i had eye surgery not long ago and i woke up and my mom put me back to sleep and let me say one thing I got fully scared the doctors just looking at me fully anxiety
Wale 🤣🤣🤣
I woke up during my wisdom teeth surgery to the people talking smack about some chick named Susan. Not sure what Susan did but she’s under fire. When I woke up I was completely responsive and even picked up my phone from my purse. The nurse was surprised on how ready I was right after being brought in.
My dad woke up while the dentists were taking out all of his teeth, and when they were putting hooks in his mouth. My dad's body is very resistant to a lot of things-
Man is legit carrying his pickle and 2 lemons
It happened to me I couldn't feel anything I could hear and see red I when I realized I was in the middle of sugory I laughed it off to myself then I dozed back off
Does it hurt when you wake up in the middle of surgery
I woke up as they were taking out my wisdom teeth! And they put me back out but I’ll never forget what I felt , saw and yes it’s a huge fear now!like I want to know WHY that happens and WHY it still happens!!!!???
Yea what does happen if you WALE up during surgery
Omfg is this guy okay?!
I bet he shit himself
Him: what happens if you wake up in the middle of surgery   My sis: it hurts?why are you telling a story bro   He: why are you my sister?😒
But what if you are sterilized and you can't move and you feel all that pain when they are doing surgery
Let's not talk about the guy who was awake during surgery and felt everything for 16 MINUTES....
My mom once woke up during a surgery
He meant wale up clearly 🙄
I had surgery I slepped the whole day
Doesn't really explain what happened just a story
Woah fashionista you go girl 😍
I did it twice, Doctor ask if I was awake, and said No Duh, you are just cutting and stabing me with knives,  why wouldn't I.  Then the second time I told them a funny story about my dog and cat. The Doctor said that he never had this happen before. The nurse told me what ,I said ,I thought I dreamed it. Breast cancer.
What🤔😐😶
I woke up when getting my tonsils out
Show us a video of people getting the surgery done
I know someone who woke up in a surgery and saw her own intestines
WTF 😂
But what happens if you wale up
I would scream as loud as I can
I'm not gonna scroll down but I know the comments are full of people who don't know the difference between light sedation and general anesthesia saying they've woken up.
So it is okay?
Gigachad.
It happen with me too.
🤢🤮
Intestines???!??!??!
WHAT??????!!!! What the actual ffff@#-$@#!!???
Huh?
Now ju star dis
My mom woke up during her corrective eye surgery and just let them continue. The doc and nurse were discussing something casual, I don't remember what it was, and when she was in recovery she gave her two cents about what they were talking about. The doc looked at her in shock and asked if she was awake the whole time and why she didn't say anything. She told him it was fascinating to watch what they were doing in the overhead mirror. Nurses, always wanting to watch a surgery, even their own🤣
I woke up during an egg retrieval, and I just felt the pain of the needle, squirmed and said "ow ow ow", and went back to sleep. When I woke up, I remembered that I was in pain, but didn't remember the sensation (you know how usually when you hurt yourself, you can remember the pain?)
Wtf that f up
Wale up
I like your channel really I do But you didn’t answer your question/: What happens if you wake up in the middle of a surgery And then you just start talking about a man who woke up in the middle of the surgery  So what’s you’re trying to say is that if I wake up in the middle of a surgery I would jump off and ran out of the hospital and then return with the bag?😂 It’s kinda 😆 funny
do u guys ever wale up? God so annoying LOL 😂😅
My mom to
When I was 6 I woke up in the middle of surgery and saw everything they where in the middle of taking my tonsils out and when it was done I ran around the hospital looking for my nan,mum,aunty,and grandad

Hi

What happens if you wake up in surgery  My brother: why have you waken me now let me sleep Edit: grammar
It's not fun. I've done it twice.
Aren’t u the guy from squid game
Lu lu lemon
I had surgery a couple of months ago and this seemed what I was most scared of 😂
For anyone that missed it, this didn't happen.
I woke up in the middle of my surgery for broken femur. Simply got back to sleep since I couldn't feel anything in my legs anyway and the air conditioning was at a pretty ambient temperature.
Why.
My grandma wokeup during open heart surgery she said it was the most painful thing she's ever felt, she has only %40 working heart so they couldn't do to much anesthesia
ok and 🙄👎🏻
Rgery
I had su
Trauma
I woke up in the middle of getting my wisdom teeth out I freaked out went back to sleep . When it was done I woke up with several cuts on my face.
WHAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I watched grey’s anatomy that never happened but that’s not possible
*These shorts are so entertaining, who else agrees! ❤️*
How much cost for a gallbladder surgery?
Lol

My best friend woke up during stomach surgery and saw the inside of herself. Now she is traumatized
Imagine a patient leaves the hospital puts intestines in a lululemon bag and coming back
Bro I just had surgery in January
I woke up during getting caps on my teeth
What the f***
I woke up in the middle of hernia surgery. Not for long though! The anesthesiaologist put me right back out.😂 Never felt a thing!
I cringed so bad at the end
For those who don’t want to rewatch  Just kidding I’ve done 1000’s of procedures under general anaesthetic and none have woken up.
I remember waking up during a surgery for my hernia at about 3-4 years old. All they did was tell me to go back to sleep lol (Im assuming I woke up bc they aren't supposed to put babies under a bunch of anesthesia)
He said it's fake he was just kidding guys
🇵🇱
Are you that main character from squid game?
I like how he said wale up
I woke up fighting. It was in stages. At first I could not move but I could feel every single cut. I guess my heart rate gave it away and by the time someone realized I was slapping and kicking. I remember being pushed back down on the bed and my friend that was there to take me home waited for hours because of the extra repairs they had to make and the extra dose of meds they gave me. I had nightmares for a while after that.
idk why but this gave me the chills .-.
My condolences to anyone who didn't see the text below.
Thousands of surgeries for doesn’t mean it doesn’t happen. I woke up during wisdom tooth extraction and spoke.
I've woken up during a procedure. It wasn't fun at all 🤪
I’ve had part of my colon removed and could barely move when they had to transfer me from a stretcher to my bed.
That Jared shade was amazing. 😎⛱️
He is lying he said if you pause it at the wrong  time
My first son had to be born via emergency c-section, after it was over my on-gun Dr. came into the recovery room and told me that I tried to jump off the operation table! I don’t remember any of this but it’s crazy to think about!
Oh, my grandpa watched the whole thing! No one puts him to sleep!
😱😱😱
Why are you using a picture of Jared Kushner? That's not right!
This is why i refuse to get surgery. I'm TERRIFIED of being paralyzed and still feeling pain. I wouldn't be able to get teeth pulled again because I had to get 8 shots in total because the first 4 didn't work
I've woke up during two surgeries .  The worse one was during a oral surgery.  Woke up but couldn't tell them I was awake.  They were using something like a hammer and I couldn't feel pain but I felt each hard blow.
My friend woke up, but she was sedated so she could not move or say or do anything. She could feel all that was done to her and was traumatized. These do happen.
I would wake up and be screaming my head of and shout "PUT ME BACK ASLEEP NOW!"
U wake up an are basically paralysed, u can feel everythin but can’t move to tell them , so I’ve read
I reckon that’s actually fake because you see you intestines you die from shock so soon as you wake up you would see your intestines and probably flat line.
Wale
Title- What happens if u wake up in middle of a surgery?  Me: I think you forgot what u were talking abt
😲😲😲 OMG! Now who's liable for that? The hosp?  I thought they are monitoring you @ all times. I have 2 daughters 1 is a Nurse Practioner & the other a Registered Nurse. I'm going to ask them cause here you are all hooked up, a needle in your hand or other areas. Those stickers on you monitoring your heart rate etc. They have many there that SHOULD BE monitoring everything. I'm not denying what your saying cause man stories I've heard? Nothing surprises me anymore. Thank You for ALL you do! Take Care & Stay Safe 🙏
Jared lost his spine.
So I was five and my parents took this hospital or dentist I don't remember if it wasa that or the dentist I woke up during the middle of something and I couldn't breathe but the dentist/doctors helped
Wow😳
Let's see how can you still be alive when some of your organs are out of your freaking body

Hey who was able to pause at the right time to see some text at the left coroner in a red box with the first sentence saying “just kidding :) :p “
I would've never knew that that happened
Actually,you always wake up at least once,They just slap you so hard back to sleep that you forget that you woke up
I woke up in the middle of surgery when they were putting stents in my kidneys but they put me back under haha
I just realized.. I think your the guy from squid game that won😳
I've been awake in surgery, I remember them talking but couldn't open my eyes or move too tell them xxx
I woke up during a surgery don’t worry I won’t hurt much (as long as u don’t take out ur inststines ) they just gave me a anesthesia
You lool like player 456 from squid game
Wale*
You sue the doctors
This shows that anyone can make up a story & everybody would believe it
I'm having a hard time believing this one. First of all, he knew he was getting surgery. Why would he react that way? This story just doesn't make sense to me. 🤔🤨 Also, why wasn't he too drowsy to get up that fast? Was this guy a recovering drug addict? If so then his body might've been highly tolerant to the anesthesia. 🤔
Does anyone else see he spelled wake up wrong lol
Ah yes, i wale up everyday!
Yeah I unfortunately woke up from the surgery when it was done
I woke up,  looked around and the tools and the dr.  While I was polite I told them I'm sorry but I am in alot of pain right now and  This just isn't working for me amd then the fight was on.   I was still fighting them blacking out and fighting .  They were not gentle and I was still in and out fighting when then took me to my room.  They told my dad.  If she doesn't stop and the hip replacement snaps We will reset it without giving her anything!   My dad whipers for me to please calm down and repeats what they said.  I guess just hearing my dads voice is what calmed me.   The surgery prior to this I had a reaction to the anesthesia and as I came to I bolted off the table.  Told them can't catch me!  Ran past my folks in the parking lot then just walked back in sorta worn out.    The first was during the surgery the 2nd was when I came to and I felt like a 4 year old playing and being silly.   I just do not have very good luck with surgeries.   Not sure
My dads a surgeon. This stupid shit happens way too often.
Sir, you answered the wrong question. He said “wale up”.
I wish that’s not happened to me
No way!!!!
Aren’t you paralyzed??
Wale
Bro did not u act in squid game
Thats going happen to me
I actually woke up in the middle of surgery because I was getting pins put in my arm and all they did was give me a shot and I fell asleep
WTF THEY SHOULD HAVE CHASED HIM DOWN AND HOW DID HE NOT DIE FROM BLOOD LOSS
OMG 🤭
Just want to say thank you for always bringing great content! I love these! ❤️

Om
My dad woke up while they were removing a cancer in his stomach- it must've hurt
My friend once woke up was told not to look down. He looked down and saw his intestine and then was put back to sleep
That was when biden was elected. If course he ran
I don’t want to believe this but I know it is true
I woke up during dental surgery. They were just like “oh you’re awake. We’re almost done you’re doing great” while I was dazed and 2/10 awake. They were breaking my teeth and I heard the cracking sounds going on inside but I didn’t feel anything at all
I woke up early from surgery I was still in the operating room but they were done with everything so I was good but I was in terrible pain
Wait so they just let him run out of the operation room?😂
Why did he use a photo of Jared kushner tho 😂😂😂😂
But that doesn’t tell us what happens when you wake up
I am getting my tonsils out in a few weeks I hope that doesn't happen to me 😩😖
Hello!
This is why they got a guy specifically for anesthesia
I am disturbed, but ohh a lululemon bag,  I see you
But how
I love waling up
My mom woke up in the middle of surgery and they didn’t put her back to sleep so she felt everything and she said it hurt super bad

*Literally the 1% people who's reading,,, I strongly hope your parents Live Longer Than 300 years with awesome health ✅🙏*
Who just wakes up in the middle of surgery it cut open and it’s like oh I’m gonna go somewhere maybe Lululemon and comes back with his intestines still alive in a Lululemon bag like👁👄👁
He had me until the lulu lemon bag ngl
That’s impossible
Patient: **grunting** Assistant: sht he's waking up and we ran out of sedatives! Doctor: chill no biggie. watch **sucker punch the patient**
If you wake up in the middle of a surgery, the doctors will just slap you so you can faint again.
I woke up in a surgery but I was so scared that I couldn't move and I was put back to sleep
I’d just be like “uh, I don’t think this is how it was supposed to go”
He said he’s just kidding
Was the anasthesiolgist taking a nap
i woke up from during a surgery, but for like 2 seconds
True story?
WHATTTTT
Source: trust me bro
I thought when having surgery you are awake at the whole time 😌😌😌
My grandma woke up in the middle of her knee replacement and wanted to help the surgeon. This is a ture story by the way
I've woken up twice while in surgery. Once because my IV came out and no one noticed it. And the second time I have no idea, but I wasn't in pain and they put me right back to sleep.
Bro ur wierd
he never answered what they’ll do
SHAWN MENDAS IS THAT YOU
Stop lying for views
I heard that someone woke up during surgery but he couldn't move and he just felt pain
You look like that guy in squid game bro .
GI-HUN
are you  the guy in squid game ??????
Real shit though, if I was to wake up in a situation like that all I’d hope for is that I either can’t feel anything going on or at least be able to inform them that I can feel what’s going on and not be paralyzed in the situation cuz I’ve heard of that happening too and they felt everything 😭
Didn’t explain my question tho
I was suspicious at "young man" and "removing part of his colon."
Best option: The doctors punch the shit out of you and knock you out
So what happen?
Holy shit that sounds intense
He’s got guts 😎
Wake up❌ Wale up✅
*Wakes up* Hey what going AHHH WHY ARE YOU CUTTING IN TO ME *Walks back in* I see why now
You sue the hell out of the anesthesiologist and facility. Thats what you do.

I thought you turn gay
You look like the guy from squid game
That is scary
Patient:Hi, I'm Back
My mom woke up in the middle of her surgery too. She said she felt everything but couldn’t move or talk. She told me it was so painful.
I dont know how you would get awake in a surgery. those who comment that they feel pain  when they woke up but paralyze must be a hoax, when i get surgeries i either paced mindlessly until you get ahead of your self and 6 hours already pass or just i blink like i never gets sleep for a day. But hey im just the kind of guy who never sleeps on surgery!
What do you mean he came back
The verbal response from the doctors were different. I scared the one who removed my tonsils, and the one who removed my wisdom teeth swore.
You don’t really know what’s going on and if you can move then you’ll hear the doctors calling your name, if you can’t move but can only hear then chances are you’re gonna feel them poking around wherever they are. When I woke up I could move but I was so sedated that I couldn’t open my eyes and I felt pain and just wanted to get up but I was held down and administered a higher dose. Thanks THC
Ah yes, I too love waling up during surgery
Does that not hurt ??
what was in his mind, tho'....?
You cant move and you woed feel all the things that was going on
I woke up under My shoulder operation. I remember It all but I had No pain.
you KNOW its true when HE says "true stpry"
I have hade 4 surgeries on my leg and I am 10 I am glad that has not happened!
I’ve had 5 surgeries over the years, the first or second (can’t remember which one now) I woke up in the recovery room with a tube in my throat and the nurse pushing me down bc I wanted to get up (apparently I was panicking and trying to leap out of bed)  But THIS IS INSANE ONE OF MY WORST FEARS!!!
So if he alive?????
Damn Jared kushner?
Wait a secon... So now you can WALE UP😲😲😲
Why did I believe this at  first😂
Bro I'd hate to wale up
Omfg I just made 262 likes omg
That is me
What a douche! Lying is NOT cute.
Creepy but I remember seeing an image from the middle of MY surgery. I was 3!
How the hell did he not die?
A young man named Jared Kushner?
And if you’re in America you file a lawsuit for malpractice 🤪
Being awake and not able to move but feeling everything during surgery is one of my worst fears!
My Mom had to have her nose broken because it didn’t grow back straight when she broke it a really long time ago. She woke up when they broke her nose. Years later I slipped and broke my nose and they said well if it doesn’t grow back right we’ll need to do surgery. I’ve endured serious repetitive sinus infections and other issues but I will not let them break my nose. Nope, nope,nope. I will die with a deviated septum.
I woke up during surgery, bone spur removed from my ankle. Thank God I couldn’t see my ankle. I told them I was awake and they gave me more anesthesia. Actually that happened twice when I got cortisone in my back. 🤔 Maybe it’s just me
where can i read the full chronology???
So scary
I woke up in the middle of them changing my wires for my defibrillator it sucked
I had heart surgery when I was 14. I got an infection and fluid built up in the sack around my heart. I woke up in the middle of them draining the fluid with a big ass needle in my chest.
What? How?
MONKEY BONE
🤠
Painnnnn
Whattttt😱 Omg didn't he feel any pain
That's what's propofol is for. No matter how hard you try you can't move even if your awake
Jared kushner?
I’d say sum shit that would make them freak out and spoiler alert I’d say don’t freak out just hit me again and they’d freak out 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Please say this is a joke
I was about to say how tf did the guy not die from blood loss then I saw the just kidding sighn.
Example of flight or fight system
I had similar experience just I didn't run out the door and shit lol I was looking at the screen 😅
WHEN I WAS HAVING MY C SECTION I FELT THEM CUTTING ME THE PAIN WAS EXCESSIVE PAINFUL I JUST REMEMBER SCREAMING SAYING JESUS I FEEL YOULL CUTTING ME THE I HEARD FEET SOUND LIKE RUNNING, I WIKE UP AND THE BABY WAS ON MY CHEST SO THEY PUT ME TOO SLEEP,I DONT KNOW HOW I FELT THAT, BECAUSE THEY USED ANESTHESIA
…
Why do u look like the squid game guy
Did you guys not look at the bottom left at the end
Amen
you look like the squid game character.
I woke up during eye surgery after an injury I had. I felt paralyzed and unable to talk at first and then I was able to move my hands and feet and fully feel what they were doing in my eye. A few seconds later they injected me again and I was out.. won’t forget that day.
My biggest fear lmao
Wtf why would you say that now im like fuck hospital let Jesus take the wheels
This got me weak ,I can barely type help
Happened to my mother during a C- section....traumatic.
My nanny woke up in one of hers and said “what ya see down there doc?” Man she was amazing 😂 the doctors laughed their asses off telling us the story
R.i.p for the kids that can't read
There has been a case where some one wasn’t fully put to sleep before surgery and they felt every cut and everything they did and she sued them for millions after
Oh nice, makes me want to have surgery in the future. Lol pretty scary could’ve been worse so they have nightmares over
My grandfather actually woke up during a foot/leg surgery. (I'm not sure which) he just sort of watched until the nurse noticed and injected more anesthesia. They apologized after about freaking out and doing that without checking amounts first.
The most eye opening thing about this post is the fact that this man was able to perform 1000’s of surgeries while he was under general anesthesia 👀
I would think they would knock u out but by punching u
So its total cap
It cant be true bc the amount of anesthesia would disable your ability to move like your arms and legs and neck so if he woke he’ll only feel excruciating pain so he wouldn’t be able to do anything, plus he’d probably collapse by the time he got out the hospital so its not exactly a “true story” bc the same thing happened to me fgs.
I’d rather die like a dog in a gutter than be admitted to a hospital for knowing this
Lulu lemon guts that’s crazy. One time I was put to sleep so they could remove five teeth. I woke mid way and I could feel an opening in my mouth. I left in pain and crying
Blood loss????
I like how you really didn't tell us what happens when you wake up in the middle of surgery
I can imagine the person who signed him in originally saying “oh your back for a check up on the area” and him saying “my bits fell out”
I’d just ask for them to put me to sleep again 🤣
Id tell the surgeon to hurry up
If I were to wake up I would probably shit myself ngl
Not cool. You make this into a joke like it never happens. During my last EGD I woke up halfway through it. The anesthesiologist had to quickly incubate me RSI to put me under general anesthesia instead of managed anesthesia care because I was physically trying to fight the GI dr as he had tubes and instruments going and coming from inside of me and it was very painful and scary.
Jesus
Wtf😨
Just go back to sleep
Damn bro I bet it hurt
What-
Nothing like fresh purchase from lululemon
My imagination is graduating by this fact
The amount of effort the surgeons do to not contaminate you just for you to run out with your intestines hanging our
I woke up in a surgery getting my arm rebroke because it was growing back wrong. Was ab 11 years old and I just screamed over And over “I want my momma” lol
Wale up
I was taking an xray during a cysto. As I slid the film plate under the bed frame, the patient opened his eyes and looked at me. It really startled me. The urologist said, "He's a little light". Anesthesia then made an adjustment and the pt. settled down. My heart was still pounding!
Dr should be an actor, i just believed everything he said
Terrifying
God this is terrifying. I woke up getting my wisdom teeth out and that was scary, so I can’t imagine this-
Yeah maybe don't say "true story" with only a half a second of small text that says "just kidding"...
I did wake up in the middle of mouth surgery to the sound of my tooth being crushed with what I can only describe as pliers. I couldn't speak obviously but I did grab the Docs arm and made grunting noises so they hit me again with the good stuff. I still remember that horrible sound though and that was at least 7+ years ago.
Do IV’s hurt?
The amount of pathogens and dust that would enter a person’s body in such a scenario is just horrifying to think about…
Nice clickbait
What the fuck is a colon
Not truuuuue
That true story 😂😂
I love the photo you used of the 'gentleman' with no colon 😈
Ricardo Milos was here…..
Uhhh ‘has same bag’
Apparently my father has woken up and he says "I can feel that" And the doctor supposedly said "no you don't" and they pumped him up with more anesthesia.   Idk, he could be lying.
How did he sit up when his literal ab muscles weren’t active
Lol
Yikes!!
“Ahhh what a nice nap  , such nice room service “ ….   “I seem to be missing something “
I was the one who also woke in the middle of surgery, there was an issue with my anesthesia. I could hear my anesthiologist panicking somewhat😂. The amount of anesthesia was not correct since I had a sudden weight loss 2 days before the surgery(atleast that was what I was told after my Operation).
I have not only woken up during surgery…just as the surgeon was cutting my stomach open and I told him it hurt….but I’ve also not been asleep before they put the breathing tube down but they had already given me the paralyzing medicine and I was scared because I couldn’t breath in…the anesthesiologist just said, “it’s ok, we will breath for you.”
I've awakened during 2 surgeries so far.  I only screamed bloody murder.
My dad is a vascular surgeon ( don’t be scared of what I’m about to tell you it is very rare) and so when he finished a successful surgery as thought his patient wasn’t waking up even though this was an old woman so they waited a bit more since of the age and thought it was normal later when they got scans since they still weren’t waking up they found out that she had a stroke which is very very very rare
O ...ewe gosh.. I would collapse if I saw all that... No no
How can something be so disgusting and so badass at the same time, lol
I woke up from having new teeth drilled into my jaw just after they finished was not mean to wake up yet had a need in my arm that wasnt meant to be there also had a huge hard on 😂😂😂
This happens to me every time I have a procedure because not one doctor or dental surgeon has ever listened to me when I sAy I need to have more anesthetic or something. For some reason they’re always shocked. I’m the size of 5’2 100-110 person but need to be treated like I’m 6’5 and 300lbs because of the redhead gene 😅
Of all the bags to put your intestines in 😂
😱
My dad woke up in the middle of his hernia surgery
This happened to me! I was having a colonoscopy and they were removing some polyps. I remember starting to come to and I felt this immense pain. It felt like someone shoved a drill up my bum!! I heard a woman say she is coming to and I went right back out. I'm guessing they gave me some more anesthesia. I will always remember that pain. I couldn't even scream. Thankfully they took care of me and put me back under.    I would also like to say that this happened at LSU Hospital in Shreveport. It was many years ago. Also, this hospital is part of the training for new doctors. First year doctors do most of the work while they have a more experienced doctor teaching them and keeping an eye on them.
Why
"What happens if you wake up in the middle of surgery?" Well the anaesthesiologist starts looking for a new career for a start
Okay but that doesn’t answer as to what happens. Its just a instant of one time of what happen
The doctor punches you in the nose so you can't see what's going on
Woke up screaming & I was put back out.
OK so what happens when you wake up in the middle of surgery you just told us a story about what happened to one individual person a rare case if that so what happen some normal people when they wake up during surgery I’m sure not all of us are going to get up and run away and put her kidney in a bag
During my first surgery I was opening my eyes several times but didn't really wake up completely. Remember seeing the ceiling and falling asleep again.
“What happens if you wake up in the middle of a surgery” probably lord of pain and maybe death
Just give em a knock on the head. Works every time
What is actually scary is anesthesia awareness. Where all you’re senses work but you are paralyzed.
This is hilarious. Love the sense of humor
It happened to me during my wisdom teeth removal. I remembered opening my eyes a little and seeing them blurry. They saw that I was waking up and they said "it's okay Justina, we're going back to sleep now". Felt no pain, and I was really happy I didn't, glad I didn't freak out either. They were really nice. Anesthesia wears off at certain times depending on the dose.
"Hey what's in that LuLu Lemon bag? " The man: *intestines* 😀
I woke up during wisdom teeth and I could open my eyes and hear but that was it. Couldn't feel pain but could feel all the pressure and hear everything that was happening too me. It took every fiber of my being and I do me every fiber to move my fingers around so they could no I was awake
I woke up during my colonoscopy. I said I’m awake and the doctor said I’ll give you some more anesthesia!
Boy what de hell mens got de lele bag for his intestiticles
OW VERY OW
ehe
Uuuuuh I’m just gonna pretend I didn’t hear that
If i woke up between a surgery AFTER SEEING THE HOSPITAL i already be fainted🤣🤣
Wasn't there a movie about this?
When my mom was having me.. the surgeon forgot to put an eye cover over her face and the anesthesia did not work all that well... She was watching the whole surgery and finally the surgeon found out that she's not having eye covers and she was watching the whole surgery and he freaked out .. Coz according to him you might even get a heart attack watching it ..
Actually happened to me when I was undergoing surgery (twice). Second time I warned the surgeons beforehand that I may be a skinny female but be warned. They laughed.  Afterwards they were like, umm yeah you were right, we had to give u more anesthesia in the middle of surgery cause u started to wake up.
Oh lord
you didn’t even tell us what happeneds u just tel us a story
I woke up during eye surgery for a partially torn retina. The whole team was having a very interesting discussion about the sexual exploits of one of the male nurse's sisters. I let them know that I had awakened. They got very flustered. "Hey! You're not supposed to be awake, yet!", and put me back under. Later they denied the whole thing.
I woke up while getting my tonsils removed! It was like being paralyzed. I wasn’t moving or breathing on my own. I could barely open my eyes. I felt very heavy and very tired. It didn’t hurt or anything. I heard the doctor(s) say something about me being awake and they gave me more of the sleep stuff and I fell asleep. It was… so strange
I had to watch this 9 times to see the “just kidding” warning 😪
ayo 😳
Wtf
Dang
My mom had a C section with my brother and she was awake but numbed during it as she wanted to hear his first cry. She got her feeling back just before they stitched her up and apparently they didn't numb her again just carried on 🙄😱
My mom did too wake up in the middle of surgery
Bruh- I would just say uhh.. More medicine pls.
Its not a mistake it's a masterpiece 🌟
I'd probably wake up and say "Oh would you look at that."
Actually I woke up during surgery and even after surgery earlier than usual
I've woken from anaesthesia, it wasn't pleasant but they put me back under very quickly.
I can't imagine the pain you would feel...ouch
Is he actually
May God bless you all and your loved ones and have a blessed day, night and life!✝️💞💞
NOT THE LULULEMON BAG 💀😭
The comment he was reading said "wale"
Why just why
He must really like Lululemon😂😂😂
I was in surgery before
So why is he showing a picture of Jared Kushner? 😂
Are you the guy from the good doctor
That sucks. My daughter woke up during one of her surgeries. She said she was terribly afraid. Stupid freaking Drs don't know shit.!!!!
He needed to get groceries or his girlfriend / wife was gonna break up
:
Player 456 after he won LOL  Player 001 elmenated  001: take my jacket 456 456:😭😭😭😭😭
Hey doc did you get your booster?
My dad woke up in leg surgery they were putting a rod in his bone
Me : new fear unlocked
If a patient wakes up during surgery , then your hammer you used to knock them out with wasn't big enough .
Ok player 456
My aunt woke up and staid up intell the end of them taking her tonsils
I would probably scream
me:ciao I’m awake yass 👏 AYO WHAT YOU DOING WITH MY BODY STOP  also me:I’m back with my intestines eoww yall tryna get stuff out of me I did it in 1.5 seconds so I’m a doctor 🤪🤪
What happens if you *wale* up in the middle of the surgery
My mom woke up during surgery and she said how awful and painful it was because they didn't know she was awake and it took them awhile before they knew. It's terrifying especially when you're awake but your body is paralyzed. She was talking about the burning sensation aswell as the smell. 🤦🏾‍♀️😬.
i once woke up in the middle if surgery and i was like oh u still operating and went back to sleep. the anesthesia didnt ware of completely but i was aware of wts going on 😂😂😂
You just scarred me
They should have a guy and/or girl always looking at he patients eyes
Jared
I would just run 10 feet and come back.
Ayo my enire botte? Of my body is inside this back so can you put them back
I woke up bit I was strapped to the table because it was heart surgery and they were having to tip the table. I looked up and saw my heart on a big monitor and my eyes got huge and then some guy rubbed my head for a second and said "You're okay. You're safe, but I need you to go back to sleep." And then it was lights out lol.
That said wale up (we'll autocorrect that to whale)  If one were to start a whale transformation mid surgery, there would obviously be cause for alarm. As a massive amount of flesh begins to be added to the person in question the doctors would scramble to close up any holes they had opened in the torso area. The next step is to evacuate the building and watch as a brand new beautiful whale joins the cast of the nearest aquarium.  This is approximately what would happen if you were to whale up during surgery
You’re from squid game
You are strapped to a table.
Question: what happens when you wake up during a surgery   Answer : telling a story
You fire the anesthesiologist. That’s what you do!!
🤢🤮
His body was open huh
Lawsuit time
Well thats effin gross
That's horrifying
The comment said wale not wake
Wale up?
"What happens when you wale up"??????? Wale????
My mom recently had covid then had to have thumb surgery because she had something called skiers thumb? They gave her Anastasia (to fall asleep) but it didn’t work on her. She had to go back a week later and finally it out her to sleep.
🙊🙊🙊😥😥😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫😧😧😧🥺🥺
Wut
Sue the anesthesiologist for malpractice!!
Gi hun that u
He meant "wale" not wake
It is possible but it’s like a 1 in a hundred million, but you can’t move or use your mussels and you will be fine if you stay calm🙂
Why tho????
Would it hurt bc your not asleep so you bc when your asleep you  can't feel enything??🤔🤔🤔
How's he not dead yet
Wale
A lot of people might have missed that "Just kidding" dialogue box at the end. And I'm laughing imagining it
WAIT BUT LIKE WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU *W A L E* up? 🤔
I don’t get it why would they let him leave ?? Also don’t they have people in charge of the whole sleeping thing?? I need answers!!
You didn't even answer your own question
If you know about amputees, how do they cut it, do they cut the bone, and what do they do with the rest of the leg? Again, this is just if you know it.
I woke up as a kid trying to get a stumck test  but have been unable to get a test since. The staff are a bit off but nice eventually when I got sidated enough, the nurse was very pretty.
should’ve just brought inspire aced
XD
I like that the young man is Jared Kushner. That was a great image that popped into my head😂
Do he just... I'm not gonna ask.
I’m just coming to give my intestines to the doctors can you install them for me the doctors what the F
Wow
How dint he die when he had his intestines in a bag
When he said " what happens if you wake up in the middle of surgery" I thought he was gonna tell us what they do to put him/her back to sleep, not tell a story...
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Yeah my uncle working woke up during open heart surgery
Preppy videos is typing....
One of our family friends was awake during surgery. She couldn’t move or talk but she was fully conscious of what was going on. She could use her eyes to so all she could do was watch as they performed surgery on her.
I woke up during my elbow surgery I was too scared to look so I just looked the other way and they gave me more anesthesia loll
If I would've woke up I would be like doctor can I get some more of that sleepy liquid I don't wnna go to school
Squid game
Is he alive
They got us in the first half..not gonna lie
Squid Game main character IRL
Is that Jared Kushner. For real.
You can wake up during surgery but it’s like a 0.000000001 chance
Feyk
YouTube polls: are u having surgery Everyone having surgery: *wakes up*
Wake up not wale up jk
Excuse me what?🙀🙀🙀🙀
Oh my good lord
Actually the question was wale up
I love how the comment said “wale” instead of “wake”🤣😂
What if the doctors try to put you asleep but you don’t go to sleep or what if you die in the middle of a surgery
.                                                           Cool
I kinda feel bad for laughing💀💀
Beat the crop out the Dr cutting me up!!! How about that
NASTY
I vaguely remember waking up during my first anesthesia for a tonsillectomy but it was before the surgery had actually started. I woke up as they were putting the breathing tube down my throat and I guess that alerted them to up the dosage or whatever. I can't even imagine if that had happened in the middle of surgery. All I can remember is the feeling of the tube scratching my throat and the lights were pretty bright and then some woman saying something before falling asleep again til it was done.
One time I woke up while having a tube down my throat (was getting my stomach looked at) and apparently I was fighting the doctor and the nurse and they had to stop in the middle because I was “extremely aggressive” and multiple people could not restrain me. I can’t remember any of it.
Theres a real story about this but not fake a man was in a surgery replacing his idk organs and then he woke up and he couldnt talk or move but he feeled every part of his organs being replaced
Imagine seeing a person cut open running
It’s fake did y’all even read the end
Not "wake" up, "wale" up
Wtf na that's some bull shit💀 HIS INTESTINES? 💀 LIKE WTF EMAGINE HOLDING THAT LIKE 👁️👄👁️
I may be wrong here but I’m guessing. Isn’t the reason why there’s a million people in the OR is to monitor every little thing that could possibly go wrong during a surgery? Like someone is sitting there just watching your respirations to make sure they doesnt drop or go too high, etc.. And the other techs in the OR are also there to make sure a sudden spike in vitals isn’t a sign that you’re actually awake but paralyzed and can’t do anything.
Ive had 2 experiences with this, the first was when I was having surgery on my lower abdomen and I woke up and talked to the anesthesiologist for about 5 min. He asked me if I could feel anything, and I told him I could feel pressure on my right thigh, as one of the assistants was leaning on it. I asked him how much longer they had to go and he told me not much longer. Then he upped the drugs and I went out again. The second time was when I was being prepped for an upper endoscopy and the anesthesiologist gave me the paralytic first and delayed the sedative, and I became aware that I was paralyzed and was no longer breathing but obviously couldnt say anything about it. This lasted about 30 seconds or so before I was put under.
WHAAAA???????
If you wake up they give you more anastetic lol
Not true at all
😭
WTF
That was my son
I'm perhaps traumatized now?
Wale up mate!
Look 👀 at my name 🌫
Once happened to me
Well that’s… horrific
What happens if you wale up in the middle of surgery🤣🤣🤣
I started waking up during surgery to remove my gall bladder and my appendix.  I couldn’t open my eyes or move but I heard the stapler (I didn’t even know people could get staples), felt the tug of my skin checking the staples, and heard the doctor talking about his vacation.  I never prayed so hard in my life to pass out before I completely woke up!  Then I heard someone say she needs more and then I went out again.
I would just put my pillow in the other side
My uncle woke up during his heart surgery and he screamed
If it happened to me i could littelery poop and pee my self tbh😂😂
UMM my roblox bestie username is lululemon-
Fun fact: my mum woke up a few times in the middle of her knee replacement surgery!  The reason why is because instead of only having anaesthetic to put her to sleep, the surgeons opted to give her a spinal block first and then not rely so much on the stronger anaesthetic to knock her out. They only wanted her to feel comfortable. She woke up a few times because of how careful they were being with the amount of anaesthetic they were using on her and she said she didn’t feel a thing. She just talked to the anaesthesiologist for a lil while in between the little periods where she was waking up. She said she woke up around the time they were fitting the prosthetic and could hear them hammering into her bone 😭😭😭😭  She wasn’t freaked out at all though. Considering how she felt nothing and didn’t see what was happening nothing scarring happened. Tbh she’s quite excited that this strange little event happened because now she can tell people about it! She’s weird like that hehe
"CaRrYiNg HiS iNtEStIneS iN a luLu lEmOn BaG"
Dr. Youn!!!! You play too much 💀
It happened before but idk when. I had two surgeries. Each one they had me sign on paper that stating "there is a possibility of having an anesthesia awareness." But its like 1 in a million according to my two surgical doctors.
didn’t answer the question?…
If you wake up during a surgery they hit you with a punch and knock you back out. It should be fairly easy since you're high.
I woke up when I had surgery the doctors was like “she’s waking up, she woke up”  I was so confused but i think I went to sleep and when I woke up they gave me a pink monkey and a popsicle
why bother waking up tbh if I'm not feeling anything I'm taking more nap time...      I wonder how many people saw the little wording at the end
I'd just wake up and go McDonalds 🤣
Thats what j asked when i got my appenidx removed. He said there was a person who msde sjre that didnt happen
K= l<
Waking up during surgery runs in my family. My dad had a cleft pallet and had numerous surgeries, woke up during enough of them. I had a spinal cord injury so that needed a few procedures. I woke up during the 2nd one. Then I told the anesthesiologist about the family history so he gave me max dose for the last surgery & that didn't do anything. We then waited like 45 minutes and then tried a different mix so I wouldn't die. Didn't really work so we went with a local in addition to continuing to try general. I woke up again as they were pulling my disc material out & waited until after the stitches were done before saying anything. Didn't want to make the doc jump while my spinal cord was in the area.
That's why in old time they used hammers lol
No its not
anesthesia awareness sucks, especially during dental surgery :D i wanted to die
i woke up in the middle of a breast reduction (pre-ftm) well it was really painful but that was ok (':
.
This is so disturbing
I've woken up during 2 surgeries. The first was an abdominal surgery, I was intubated and was trying to sit up. I heard someone yell "she's up" and I was pushed back down on the table. The second time I was having a lump removed from my breast and  I started feeling pain. I wasn't intubated, so I said "that's hurting". Everybody's hands went up in the air and I heard instruments falling to the ground. My surgeon said he was almost finished removing the lump and then all he had to do was suture the incision and because I was so calm, he asked if I wanted to finish with just a local anesthetic, so we did. I did have another incident where I was still intubated, and they had just finished my surgery and were transferring me from the surgical table to the gurney and I panicked and was trying to pull the breathing tube out.
But why was it so specific if it was fake …
Anenastisia awareness
Man i'll just wake up then tell them to stop then when i stand up.....rip that surgery was for my legs :) (no this isnt true)
What happens if they are doing surgery and you can't breathe
WHY IN BAG 😭?!?!
You have written wale up
Let's end this debate U mey (0.00001%) wake up during and surgery BUT u can't move your muscles cuz ur paralyzed. They partially paralyzed you cuz u can still move your muscles without using ur brain
Did he die
I've woke up several times during surgery. I try to warn the anesthesiologist before surgeries. Once, I woke up TWICE DURING & THE JERK DR 😐 STARTED SCREAMING AT ME?? As if it was my fault. They always immediately put more meds in my IV & put me back under but it's scary enough when it happens. Waking up to being SCREAMED AT BY A "DR" IS TERRIFYING!!
I would wake up and flip the pillow lol
Isnt that jared kushner?
That guy is a zombie
Well is a nightmare
Wale up?🤣
Wtf
I woke up at like the end of my surgery when I want supposed to um.. there were doctors looking down at me 😂
My dad woke up in the middle of surgery before he died two years ago
he shouldve have added a name lol
Oop
I woke up and asked if I was in the right hospital 😅 needless to say they over did the medicine after and I almost died from HR down to 38 while they screamed at me to stay awake.
Wait😃Hold😊up✋i 😟just😩had😬a😶frikin😤bruh😒MOMENT😃

I would stop my heart to trick them and say "I'm awake"
Get off my feed
Thank god it was a lulu lemon bag.😂😂😂
Make*
Am I the only one that noticed the question said wale instead of wake?
Doctor: hold that down gor me Patient: bet Doctor: ok thank you.....ayo
Did u guys did not realize how he spell wake up 🤣??
I did during my breast augmentation. I said “Ouch!”.
Most people who do can’t feel anything and then go back under fairly quickly. The horror stories we hear of are incredibly rare within this rarity, thankfully.
let me guess. he was bald too
My mom waked up while surgery since she fell down the stairs or the window
Oh but why did he run out tho like…
My brother woke up through brain surgery
Thanks for giving me nightmares for a month
I once woke up during oral surgery.  Getting TEN teeth removed. The nurses pushed me back down and I knocked back out. I woke up the second time when I was supposed to and I was hysterical.  😆 it's was scary waking up to that.
Oh god this scared me until I realized it didn't really happen, I have top surgery Monday and I'm really on edge about it lol
Ok
I like how you didn’t answer the question and just told a story
You'll run away with your organs out. Great
Still didn't answer the question you just gave a short story
How?
I just realized that I have a Lululemon bag... 🤔
Merry s that how semi Colen was made
“Hey bro what’s up?” “Oh hi nothing much” “What do you have in that bag of yours” “Oh nothing, just my intestines” “Your……what!?”
I woke up when I was having my wisdom teeth out they eventually noticed and put me back under
But.... what? Qho would keep running with their guts falling out?
I hope that if I ever wake up during surgery, the doctor just straight punches me in the face to knock me back out
I thought the doctor gives you a punch a face to finish that surgery
Um———— WHAT!?!!???
Still didn't answer the question
Jared Kushner is the man in the story?
this does happen, although it is extremely rare. one of the doctors in the hospital my mom works at had a patient whose anesthesia had failed and yet whose paralytics were still in effect; they noticed something off within a few minutes because his heart was going insane and whatnot. she didn’t tell me much else other than that the patient is absolutely traumatized and now has trouble falling asleep in dark rooms. that is ... nightmarish, definitely.
Funny how he didn’t answer the question
That makes no sense
I knew this was false when u said jumped up, it’s believable to wake up but there’s no way you would be able to move...
hu
Me to my friend shortly after waking up: “Sorry I have to leave so early. I just remembered I have work today.”  My friend being the surgeon performing a life saving operation on me: “Ayo… Jim, sit back down”
OMG This happened to my uncle he was getting a surgery on the same thing but he didn’t leave they just put him back to sleep and he said he seen himself cut open he said the nurses were freaking out like how is he awake
I swear you look like 456
I love when he tells us what happens when you wake up
I woke up in the middle of a colonoscopy. I opened my eyes and there was a TV monitor showing the feed from the camera that was being snaked through my intestines. Ever wonder what your insides look like?    Well, I know.
Are u player 456
Just thinking about it
No one gonna talk Abt how he look like player 456?
My dad did and he kinda just went hurrrggggg AHHHH
I woke up during surgery when they were removing my wisdom teeth. Had to up the gas to put me back under.
If i wake up, id just be like "10 more minutes"
funny story but what happens if you wake up? what does the hospital do?
What 😮
He didn’t say wake up,he meant what if your turn into a whale in the middle of surgery
SQUID GAMES
My mom has woken up in sirgery
OH WHAT THE-
This makes me feel weird now
I dreamt I was in a battle. A blk. Stallion approaches with all blk. Armour and a very long blk. Shiney lancet sword. We were battling he pierced my waist. Then I awoke and the medical staff.
U can’t survive long at all with ur Intestines. So he would’ve had to come back in a few minutes
I thought the comment said wale up 🤔
Well don't the anesthetist put you back to sleep???
Wale
So what happens? YOU DIDNT ANSERR IT YOU MORON
Legit I’m sure it was real but I’m pretty sure it’s very rare for it to happen.
I had to get eye surgery twice for retina detachment so I’m glad I didn’t wake up… but now I might have to get muscle surgery on my eyes
Better question ! WTF happened to the doctors ???
If I wake up the first thing I would do is die.Imnserious I would kill myself on that operating table-
*Me, Wakes up* Huh? Where am I- Doctor: * *bonk* * We may continue.
What happens if you die while in surgery
I actually woke up during my surgery when they were removing a lesion on my neck
“Hey, why are you carrying a LuLuLemon bag?” this man: *intestines*
Wake ----> wale
imagine operating on someone, then the patient just gets up and flips his pillow on the colder side lol
Are you squid game winner
He... didn't answer the question tho. 🥴
Ive had anastesia wear off while having  a c-section . Twice . Awful!!
i woke up right before the doctors were about to pull out my tooth in a tooth surgery:) true story.
😳
just get it to 200k likes its literally at 199k STOP TEASING MEEE 😩😭
You're never gonna wake up ever again if you wake up😭
the way you say true story and you your facial expression proves you can't lie
how is that possible how he not die or feel shit
E
AYO DIS THE GUY FROM SQUID GAME
Yet he didn’t explain what happens
Holy shit! That’s scary
my mom woke up during shoulder surgery, something about swimmers shoulder or something from doing ultrasound, it was enough to feel the pain but she couldn’t move because it was just enough anesthesia, the anesthesiologist wasn’t monitoring and after 20 minutes someone was finally like “I think she’s awake”   ….. this woman is tough.
I woke up during a pacemaker implant procedure.  My comment was "I'm about to get up and leave".  They upped the meds and I went back to sleep.  I ended up with temporary PTSD that lead me to flashing back to that time whenever I tried to sleep.  Got over it after a couple of days.
I didn’t know that Joel Osteen is a Doctor.
He didn't answer the question ⁉️
I'm sure death is inevitable
my mother told me about her stories, she said that when she was a teenager or a young adult she was undergoing a nose surgery because she genetically has weak blood vessels (now I have it after her) she was undergoing surgery for this reason and during the operation she had an open nose and woke up and everything to this day he remembers and it has been at least 15 years, apparently, during the operation, she could answer logically, they could not put her to sleep again and the doctor asked someone to give him a rendgen of her nose and my mother then replies that no one will give it to him because no one did it in the first place during this Mum's surgeries put some plaques in the nose and after a few days of ignoring everything strange by the doctors, my mother sneezed and then out the plaques because she was allergic to this material and for this reason the wounds would not heal
That doesn't answer the question but thanks for trying ig
I’m always asking, isn’t he like a plastic surgeon and not a doctor?
My guy won gulag mid surgery
What happens if you wale up in the middle of surgery.  Find the incorrect spelled word(wale)
during my wisdom teeth removal i woke up in the middle of it and i started swinging my hands in the air and saying stuff so they had to cut it short
Cap
That's why you also get a muscle relaxer
My mom woke up in the middle of her surgery and she said she never felt more pain in her life.
Him:what happens when you wale up in a middle of a surgery.  Me:why the hell do you miss the k of wake and put it l,wake😂😂😂😂😂

The fact that he chose Jared Kushner as the "patient" 😂
Woke up during my wisdom teeth surgery with what felt like 10 hands in my mouth. Dr said. "Ok, back to sleep." And before I knew it I was being wheeled to my moms car. 😳😬😊
This is the dude from squid game
Did anyone see the “Just Kidding” Dialogue at the end lol
I woke up during my  ankle surgery.i saw a small curtain in front of me , heard some noise of surgical instruments.i didn't  panic, instead closed my eyes and drowsed off again.☺
I woke up during scope surgery I felt something warm in my hand and looked it was a blood soaked towel I said damn you and passed back out that doc was a kwak he messed my wife and I both up we were young kids I was 19 and She was 18 he told us we both had bladder issues FALSE and put us both on super strong pain meds it was to late when we found out he was a pill mill we both went through hell but both got clean from pain meds and been sober 8 years now also that doctor got busted but hung himself before he went to jail
Aren’t you paralyzazed???
It’s not true
whats a colan
You kinda look like the main player from squid game right???
I remember when i woke up in a middle of a surgery too,it was very painful
Yha wale up
it brings me back memory. once time I wake during my pp getting circumcise I saw two doc and I told  "what's happening, doc"  then lady told me in hyper calm tone "Oh, nothing, go back to sleep" which I respond "Ok goodnight"
Imagine you war just walking and saw man  running whit his intense out
He just wanted lulu lemon, he’s probably looks good in leggings.
He's shocked to find him there!
How did he not die ?
Sorry not wake up but wale up
1st question to him, why?
Carrying your own intestine? Sounds like zombies movie
my grandpa has no feeling in his feet and he has trouble with them for years and he had surgery on them multiple times and for his last surgery ( about a month ago) he stayed awake during it because he couldn’t feel it
Yea it’s wale now
My bother woke up in the middle of a surgery but after that everything was ok
"What happens if you *wale* up during surgery 🤣
He never said what happens though
I woke up when they were taking my tonsils and adenoids out. They put me back under and I didn't wake up for hours and started vomiting through my nose.
I wish they had put me to sleep.
Congratulations for winning squid game and winning 45.6 billion dollars
Jared Cushner?!? You woke up in the middle of surgery damn bro that explains a lot
"Excuse me sir, Is that yours?"
my worst nightmare.
When i was in high school i broke my wrist and need a surgery they put me to sleep then i woke up no one's there cause at that time also someone got shot and hes the priority and they left all the surgical clip still attach and i can see clearly my bones.. in my thoughts "meh im gunno back to sleep"
I’ll just say what time is it and whatever time it is I’ll say ten more minutes LOL
If you wake up from a little dose of anesthesiology while in surgery, it’s a bad day for you
it never happens...and doc never let patients to wake up while operating...they will notice if u awake and will give another little dose or via versa of it...to make sure that you are sleeping.
Now you know you can carry your  organs in a Lululemon bag
Nobody saw the "wale up"? LOL.
i would just ask the doctor to giv me gas that makes u sleep
Ah yes "wale up" my favorite thing when I am done sleeping
I woke up during surgery.  I asked my doctor a question about the scalpel cutting I was feeling. He just looked anesthetist and nodded.  She must have increased meds bc I went back to sleep.
As soon as he said "Lululemon bag" I new. WHO TF IS GONNA GO TO A LULULEMON BATHROOM AND PULL OUT THERE INTENTINS?! (I hope it was in the bathroom)
I woke up in the middle of surgery getting plates in my left forearm. Saw the inside of my arm. And said. Huh thats what that looks like. Doctor told the anesthesiologist to hit him again. Lol
"Uh...Doc, imma need you to put these back in place before I can s#!% myself."
I started to come out of my anesthesia for a hernia repair when I was 8. I recall someone saying something like Oops, he's coming to,  and then it was lights out again. This actually does happen, and is not funny.
I had throat surgery like two years ago, thank God I didn’t wake up 😂
My sister woke up in the middle of the surgery she had on her elbow
This might be a lil racist, but he kinda looks like the guy from squid game
The only thing I have to say is why Lulu Lemon
There is a story where they forgot to turn on a guys tank to knock him out and he was awake though the whole surgery and they didn’t even notice
I woke up during a tonsillectomy and it was very painful. I remember seeing blood and the surgeon made eye contact with me as he said, "uhhhuhhmmm she's awake." Kinda traumatic for an 8 yr old.
That happened to me...but not before I had a nightmare that my doctor was really just an actor...no wait!!
Still doesn’t tell me what happens
When I was 4 I was doing some dental operation for some reason (do not remember why) I was under anesthesia but woke up in the middle so they just said sleep and covered my eyes and poof I feel asleep
This is why becoming a doctor is a method of traumatization.
Bro kinda looks like Dr Park from the show"The good Doctor"
Does your heartbeat change or intensify in surgery?
Mmmm what 😵
Lulu lemon bag loool so specific 😂😂
I woke up in the middle of surgery before, I tried raising my top half and they said “no no lay down go back to sleep” I remember laying straight back down & just knocking back out but also thinking “go to sleep fast & you went feel anything” lol
I woke up after a sleep deprived mri woke up to them sticking a needle in my arm for like clearer pics and I broke the neck stabilizer doing the fasted sit up of my life
During Surgery Me:*Wakes up* Everyone in the room:😳 Me:Oh you aren't done yet?Dang am sorry wake me up when you done ok?
So what I got from this is they just let them walk out the door carrying their intestines.
I woke up in the middle of my foot reset surgery they just turned up the gas lmao
Why does this guy look like player 456
Wtf 😳!!!!
disturbingg
But you didnt tell us…
Geon?
If I’d wake up during surgery I’d be like 10 more hours of sleep and go back to sleep
Well i would imagine it would hurt like something out of this world
This actually happened to my grandmother. She was unable to say anything either and they kept working on her like nothing was wrong. It’s a huge fear of mine.
Imagine though- Seeing a man with a bag with intestines
🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤣
That doesn’t answer the question 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
OmG iTs ThE gUy FrOm SqUiD gAmE
If it was me I'd go: "what are y'all? Alliens!? Play some music"
Racked
That's not telling me what happens it's just telling me a story that happened
Because of this type of slapstick, the British call thee OR a theater.
If I woke up during a surgery I would be like "naw man, I'm just gonna go back to sleep"
U wake up? Np just go back to sleep  Easy as that
"Dam, Kevin I told you to get right amount of gas. Now looks who need to mop the floor?".
Ew
Lol imagine not seeing the jk box
That says Wale
No some 13 year old kid was about to have surgery done and they never put him to sleep well they thought he was sleeping and he couldn't even move or talk and he was sitting there while getting stabbed repeatedly and then a doctor saw and put him to sleep in the middle of it and he said all they did was talk about there animals without noticing him and they never got fired that's something which could never leave anyone
Idk if it's genetic or if your parent has done it, you're more than likely to do it yourself type thing, but my boyfriend has as well as his mother.   His family has a wildly high tolerance for medicine and pain, which sounds nice to some but it overall is NOT.   She had gallbladder surgery and she told me she woke up during it. My boyfriend was having mouth surgery and woke up during his, and if I recall correctly, he said he remembers the nurses holding down his arms as best they could.   Now, idk about his other family members currently because as far as I know, no one else has had surgery, but his father and siblings do have a high tolerance to pain and resistance to medicine. It's ashame really as migraines seem to run in the family too, which coupled with family history, it's very tough to deal with!
I just make them kill me
Never believe flashy stories without resources attached!
Holy
Id want the doctors to put me back to sleep... Idc how they would do it, they should just do it.
Omg
I'm pretty sure they'll try to knock you out again. I woke up during, an ear surgery kind of & they gave me more anesthesia.
Maybe tie them down and be prepared to sedate them straight away,,, 😱😱😱😱
*wake
so my teacher's brother was awake during a surgery, the doctors drugged him to make him go to sleep, but he wasn't fully asleep. When he "woke up", he told the doctors he was awake through it, the doctors didn't believe him, but he repeated exactly what one of the doctors said when she came in. I dont know if he felt pain or anything, but all he could do was listen with his eyes closed. (paralyzed)
What happened if u don’t
I would have flipped my pillow.
This guy kind of looks like 456 in squid game
even if you gain consciousness, I assume you won't be able to feel pain for some time until the drugs wore off
My dad back in the 80s or 90s had to have a surgery on his knee or something and they gave him loads of anesthesia assuming it would keep him asleep. He ended up waking up  right before surgery, luckily too because they almost did it on the wrong knee. He ended up getting almost enough anesthesia to knock out an elephant.
I did wake up before
Welp... Blind people won't know 😂
Imagine if you see this dude running outside with his guts falling out.
Brought back his guts in a lululemon bag 😂😂😂
Think, they are transplanting a lung and you see your chest open in two
I woke up in the middle of my tonsillectomy when I was 20. I close my mouth and bit the glove of the surgeon when he was looking for something on the tray. I hear him say"Quick! She's waking up!" He shove a wedge into my mouth and the anesthesia mask was put over my nose and the gas was pumped up really high.  That's most likely why it looks a bit weird in the back of my throat.  Other than that, I was perfectly fine.
What a career change for 456...almost didnt recognize him.
Damn that must have been a surprise for the doctors.
In the early 2000s, a middle aged Italian man woke up in the middle of an autopsy in a mortuary and sadly passed away
Tell them to give me more of whatever makes me sleep  If I had enough senses to
I'm cracking up at the fact that he used a picture of a famous person to depict that "...young man..."
Love how his video says how many surgeries he's performed and nobody woke up during. But the comments are full of stories of people waking up. I think the Dr is lying and doesn't ask patients if they woke up during.
tldr:  you hurt
You look like such a fake doctor
Too Easy
It does happen though. Just not as grandiose as this story lol. They just resedate you and you're out again. Anesthesiologists will catch it long before you regain full conciousness.
wale ✅ wake ❌
wake ❌ wale ✅
I woke up during my circumcision. I was a big kid for my age so the dose of whatever liquid that makes you sleep wasn't enough for me. Worse pain ever bruh
Vasectomy Situation   Anesthesiologist: I don’t get it, how did he wake up? Surgeon: Why are you asking me? You did that. Patient: Deez Nuts, HA GOT EM HA! Surgeon and Anesthesiologist: What?
Let’s be honest most of us would’ve tried to instinctively check our phones
Use the forget me stick
What does it mean wale up
He would bw dead if his estestines RIP my spelling came out
Me seeing it without hearing it me saying it says what happens if you wale up 😂
Idk but honestly i never seen a person "wale up" thats something new
I woke up during multiple hernia repair. I remember seeing the doctor and nurses all have an O SHIT face and getting strapped down before getting shot with more knock out juice. They were mid incision on inguinal canal.
My ex woke up during surgery on his eyes. He was a little kid when it happened yet he explains the experience like it was just yesterday...
When I was younger,  i woke up during dental surgery. Whenever I woke up, coincidentally was the same time they were sticking me with the numming shot. I screamed and kicked put the gas took me out When I got out, I cried to my parents that the dentist was trying to kill me
Hi
Player 456 is that you
I would just sit there in pain until there done
And to think… I actually wanted to know what happens if someone wakes up in the middle of surgery 🙄
*it hurts*
Okay but he didn't tell us if we're allowed to wale up or not ?
*Me imagining the young man running away with half of his body open
Is that Jared Kushner? Lol
Wale up
Wow
My  mother woke up during surgery for a hernia, the anesthetic goes through her faster somehow, something really cool too.
my great grandfather was doing surgery in one eye and he woke up in the middle of surgery. He became blind from it. The doctor who gave him the medicine got fired.
Anesthesia awareness is a very rare thing that has been reported to have happened. You become conscious during surgery and are able to hear talking and feel pain.
My son woke up in the middle of heart surgery at 9 years old! The doctor came out & told me he woke up but they immediately knocked him back out. He remembers.
No. Just no.
That wasn’t the question, the question was what if you wale up
My mom I a Nurses Aide and she told me a story about how one time a woman C-section was becoming undone and was holding it together
Wait!!! U r the guy from good doctor
My mother was having her surgery while she woke up in the middle. She couldn't speak nor she could react. What she saw was dangerous. Luckily a doctor saw her and then did their job.
He just came back from Mcdonald's
There was a story of a boy (idk if true story) he had an organ surgery and he had a sickness where you cant feel pain
Is wake spelling correct 😂😂😂
IT'S WALE UP. 🙄 Get👏it👏RIGHT.👏 GOSH.😩
Wale no wake up
But he didn’t answer the question, he just told a story
My mum woke up in heart seagery
I’m still wondering what happens when you wake up in the middle of a surgery
Edit... lol I just finally saw the blue box explaining this wasn't true he was just kidding 😅... thank goodness   No, no way is that real  ...lol he wouldn't get far with his stomach cut open... lol it would be painful having raw nerves exposed like that... there's other reasons this isn't plausible...  I'd be shocked if it really was true 👍
🏃‍♂️??? Why he do it ?
My mom actually woke up before mid surgery and she was just talking with the surgeons and then she was put back under
Oml
nice facts, squid guy
Really no one goonna point out that he spell wale up instrad of wake
The closest thing to happen to me, is getting a cavity filled and whatever was numbing it began to wear off, when it fully wore off it was so painful, luckily I had laughing gas, because all I did was laugh, and nobody knew the rest of the time.
A friend of mine felt her belly be cut open and every bit of pain during surgery but she was unable to tell them as she was out!!! She's a redhead like me and we don't respond well to pain messages
im sure they'd calm you down and just give you more anesthetic
I woke up during surgery to the military surgeon up to his elbow in my abdomen
But you didn't answer the question 😭😂
In a lulu lemon bag 😅😅💀
Wtf intestines are connected to body by mesentery how could they get out....😔 Poor guy may be having some special disorder that world is unknown of
I lost all faith in this guy when he shared false information about the covid vaccine
I woke up during a heart catheterization, as the Cardiologist was playing jump rope with my arm, as he tried to move the probe into place ! Believe he tore my Rotator Cuff, which has given me lot's of problems thru the year's ! At any rate, once they discovered I was awake, the Cat Lab got very quiet. I looked up at a monitor, and asked if that was my heart, and a Nurse responded that it was ! It was then I'm guessing the Anesthesiologist gave me more juice, and it was light's out !          💤💤💤💤💤 ¯\_😑_/¯
I would really be like : I’m sorry that I woke up should I help you guys with ending this surgery ? *tries to grab scalpel to operate on himself* True story
Didn’t he feel a ton of pain?
My cousin woke up during his amputation. Well, technically, they didn't give him enough for him to sleep in the first place. He felt all of the pain, but couldn't say anything because all he could move was his eyes. He heard everything and felt it all.
They can see when you will almost wake up and up the dose of narcotics. + they give you for some extra time so they’re sure you wake up when they’re done
I stg that's jared kushner
Why did he ran
I'm also a doctor and I'm from Vietnam. It actually happens quite a lot. Most of the time, the patient doesn't even remember. We just adjusted the anesthetic and they came back. Fortunately, they don't usually wake up in panic or pain
I only believe this guys stories because he’s the real deal
Who notices the *wale up?*
My mom said that when she was giving birth to my little sister, she said that the anesthesia wore off while the doctors were cutting her (you know what) and she said she felt everything
He was literally the walking dead 💀
I’ve gotten stitches with anesthesia and I had to stay awake the whole time, don’t worry if you need stitches it didn’t hurt
ME to
For the people who are thinking  If we wake up in middle of surgery what happens:- We will wake up and get scared,but we won't feel the pain. And any1 who wakes in middle of surgery gets a sleep in within 1minute to maximum 2minutes, since before any big surgery they injuct you with a sleep tablet.(odds of waking up in middle of surgery is :-0.000001)(almost 1 in 1 in 1 million)
My mom was doing something for her pregnancy thing to like stop it and she said the stuff wore off and she said she could feel it
well.. i woke up in my jaw surgery... and i can't explain how much scared i was.... thankfully everything went well.
When i was young the surgans were taking my toncels and adinoids ( dont know if thats how u spell it ) out and i woke up when they were doing that and i was sick bc they just put something down my throat and screamd then they put me back down again
𝘄𝗮𝗸𝗲😤 𝘄𝗮𝗹𝗲🤠
That's painful I guess
POV:It's the young him
Bro u look like the squid game guy 😱
Patient bucks sometimes and may move legs or part of the body. Then the anaesthesia team will prolong the effect of anaesthesia with MACs
What happens when you wake up and watch this..
HOLY JESUS!!!!
He might've had a chance to get out of the OR before fainting.
Just because you’ve performed thousands of them doesn’t mean these situations can’t happen
But like u didn’t say what happens?????
O im dead
Wale up?
Oh my God...
And she gust pertinente she was not
My mom woke up in sugere
I woke up in the middle of my hand surgery and punch the doctor with my opposite hand.
I woke up in the middle of having reconstructive surgery on my hand, I gasped in shock and my vision was incredibly blurry as I looked around then I heard someone yell "Shit! Give her some more!!!" Then everything went dark and the next time I woke up I was out of surgery ready to be discharged.
I actually woke up
What is Jared Kushner in this video
What will happen when you wake up on eye surgrey
Ah yes ✨wale✨
Wale up
I woke up at 4 years old when they were taking my tonsils out. Looked at them and fell right back to sleep.
Just kidding I’m a cunt
Imagine doing a surgery and your patient woke up just to ask you "aye did you wash yo hand?" and gone out cold back to sleep.
😱!?!?!?
My aunt woke up while she was getting her baby out, she touched the doctors hand and he almost dropped his surgical knife 😱
Same retard doctor that said pregnancy pain can’t be felt by men or some garbage shit 😂
Can doctors have tatto
Local anesthesia doesn’t take effect of me and I feel everything during medical procedures 💀
I call Bs, I woke up during my kidney transplant, I was so droggy from the drugs, they immediately put me back under, so we are to believe no one was in there to hold the man down?, umm, okay, right.
Id just wake up and say "Do you know joe?"
Fun facts: there is a 0,001% chance you wake up in a surgery
I sometimes wonder if the doctor intentionally has the patients wake up during surgery. Like, they lessen the amount of anesthesia so that the patient wakes up as they are cutting through their skins and pulling out their intestines, or are in other cases dismembering them. Who knows, maybe they also record such actions for their own satisfaction. Something to mull over some green tea and chocolate.
I woke up once when my teeth was getting removed (only like two ) and I looked around and knocked out . Woke up in a wheel chair and on the way to my car abt an hour later
I'm resistant to certain anesthesia and woke up while intubated after hallucinating for hours. Ended up freaking out, nearly aspirating and worked against my chest/arm restraints to disconnect it. Nurse ended up yanking it out with the bulb still inflated. Most terrifying experience I've had.
All the comments: “I/a loved one totally woke up during a surgery!” Me who’s about to have a Gi surgery and is already nervous: “…WHAT”
Imma wale up😂😂😂
I'm reading these comments and I thought I was crazy but I'm pretty sure I woke up during one of my surgeries. I can't remember which one I've had about 15 in my 26 years. I remember talking to the doctors and nurses then l was put like a light. But at one point I swear I woke up. They were telling funny stories about their families and I heard someone say give more anesthesia. It was so quick I thought I was dreaming. Never mentioned it to the doctor or my family.
Id just wake up and be like "damn, so thats what my insides look like"
Imagine just waiting for a diagnosis and this guy with his open wound runs around with a lulu lemon bags full with a organ
No wonder, that was Damien from Omen😈
Dude thought he was in a saw movie💀💀😭😭
For real tho… what happens? Do the doctors hold you down and inject something else to knock you out? What if someone gets up and runs away? I’m assuming they chase them, but what if the patient gets away?
Unpopular opinion : waking up during surgery is just waking up before your alarm goes off.
WTF? I hope you're more informative with your patients.
What happens is that your body goes into shock and your heart beat accelerates and they have to administer a sedative or more anesthesia before you flatline 😊  (Depending on the surgery of course..)
I have hated every surgery I have had, I hear everything going on. Luckily I haven't felt anything , but it still is like a black void nightmare, with all the sounds and voices of the staff....
Oh sorry man I got scare jump of forgot to drop off my organ
A guy i know woke up when getting his wisdom teeth removed
So ill run out and then back with a lulu bag.  Thats all I got cuz you never answered the question.
I woke up in the middle of the surgery but I was completely paralyzed. Couldn't move even my eyes or make any sound to tell them I am awake. Tube in my throat, unable to breathe on my own but I didn't feel any pain, just a horror not knowing if I am going to start feeling the pain. After surgery they pulled my breathing tube out and it was horrible try to start breathing again, I told doctor and he didn't believe me...until I told him what he was talking to his stuff and how he made karate moves and he was first speechless then started to apologize. I was young and didn't know that some people can get traumatized by that experience, if I did maybe I would be traumatized too. I brushed it off and next surgery was just perfect 🤗
What kind of greys anatomy stuff is this lol
Ugh
They do some procedures while the patient is wide awake in the OR. I just went through a procedure and was wide awake for the 5 and 1/2 hours during it.
“Carrying his intestines in a lulu lemon bag” that great
I woke up in the middle of surgery when I was like 7 years old. They were removing some tumors I had in my throat, I just remember that I saw a blinding white light (the ceiling lighting) and I felt things inside my throat but I didn't feel any pain, of course I tried to get up and I tried to scream, I was quite distressed and I even tried to attack the doctor with my limp ass body, the doctor freaked out and told me that everything was okay and that I shouldn't move, that it was all a dream. Then I don't remember anything because the anesthesiologist made me sleep again.
Where did he get the lulu bag tho 😳😳
I woke up when they were removing my tonsils.  They still had the whole equipment down there and everything.
Where'd he find the lulu lemon bag 💀👍
Man really did pull the best April fools prank, it's so good it's not even on April 1st!!
Last time I woke up I got shot seven times and the guy told me not to fuck his wife doctors are weird😒
They’ll just punch you hard in the face to knock you back out
I woke up during my colonoscopy over the summer. I don't remember going back to sleep, but I did.
This is my greatest fear.
How he got out from the hospital if he was having surgery?  as soon as you wake up, doctors will see you and put more anesthesia, you suppose to be attached to some machine or something, how no one hold him down? That is so weird...ok, the patient was Hulk and the Doctors weight was 75 pounds 🤣...but on the serious side...how that happened? 🤔
I woke up during my surgery on my hand, the doctor got a little scared scared i moved my finger and then he put me back down and I went back to sleep ever since then that doctor has been terrified of me
My second memory of life when I was 2 1/2, was waking up in the middle of a tonsillectomy. This was when they used ether as the anesthetic. I had not been given wnough. In 1952 Los Angeles, people didn't wage malpractice suits but if it were 2021 I think a medical license would have hung in the balance
I woke up during my hip surgery it was so fucking scary I tried to stand but couldn’t because my hip was removed it was the biggest horrible moment of my life
Short answer:   O W
Got me in the first half
That man was Jared Kushner
I woke up mid wisdom tooth surgery. So fucking painful, made a couple awkward noises and vague hand gestures, saw the surgeon lean in, then nothing after that. Weird experience. I wasn't out of it after the surgery either.... my lip piercing fell out though, lol.
The Lawsuit slapped on that Anesthesiologist was probably for 1 zillion dollars
When I was in highschool I had surgery to remove a bone blocking my sinus drain, I was told by my doctor I woke up on the operating table and tried to get up, took most of the people in the room to stop me. They then hit me with more anesthesia and finished
Why show a picture of kuschner
There's a first time for everything. Discussion with your surgeon beforehand is highly recommended.
Lmao Jared
What killed me is the specific type of bag like the LULULEMON bag KILLED me 😅🤣
Help! My insides are falling out!!  Sir, this is a Lululemon
Once my dad woke up in surgery and he said it was scary and I am 12 so when I had my surgery, god I was terrified, just hearing that someone else other than my dad woke up, is weird, considering that he had his intestines in a lulu lemon bag?
I tried to stay awake for my wisdom teeth removal and actually kind of managed it. I vaguely remember my teeth being sawed at, but my perception of time was odd because it felt very short. Anyway I’m not traumatized because I made the decision to try to stay awake and I didn’t feel any pain, only a vibrating sensation in my mouth of my teeth being hacked off, lol.
Years ago i woke up during my appendix surgery. I sat up and tried to get off the table. The doctor and nurses were all yelling at each other. They gave me a shot to knock me out. The anesthesiologist asked me where was I going. I said the rest room. I needed to vomit. The last thing i remember is them telling me to wake up. I almost died from aspiration. 45 minute surgery lasted over 4 hours.
Plot twist: It was a title when he said “What happens if you wale up in the middle of surgery”, but the typo was he meant to say “whale” 😳
Theoretically speaking though… in your medical opinion, what would you do. Or the anesthesiologist, just pump them with some more real quick to knock them out fast. Or is that like not okay, I have no idea my brains just curious now. Or would you try to talk them down…
Why is no one pointing out that he used a picture of Jared Kushner 🤣
Wow...I had a surgery because of Imperforate hymen and the doc. Put  something Inside me and made me fell asleep in less than 4 seconds
i woke up during a surgery 3 times while they were re arranging some bones in my arm. it doesn’t hurt that much i went back to sleep i just said really crazy things and saw bizarre shapes and colors
I feel like this is bullshit but ill look into it
Anesthesia is the opposite. It's waking them up that's the hard part.
Bet that was a pretty lawsuit
Guys it's wale not wake
I had to have stitches in my tongue when I was 9 and they put me under for it. I woke up at some point and I remember it perfectly. I couldn't move but my eyes could so I kinda looked around thinking hey this is just like TV! I remember feeling dental bite blocks and some kind of foreceps in my mouth and remembering the joke someone made about how I could get a tongue piercing now because I knew piercers use something to hold the tongue to pierce it. I actually felt them stitching my tongue, the prick of the needle and the freaky feeling of the thread sliding through it.. I even felt them tie off one of the stitches, it was a pressure like feeling. And I heard the people around me talking, saying how I looked just like Shirley Temple and talking about her, like one person said "Did you know her curls weren't natural? Her mom did her hair every night. Some of it wasn't wasn't hers, it was a hair piece." And someone else said "Hers (mine) are real, she had several scans earlier. Those thick curls must've padded her head when she fell, with an injury like this I'd expect a concussion or something but she's perfectly fine aside from her tongue." That's when they noticed I was awake. My nurse at the time could not get over my eyes, he said they were like diamond stormclouds, and when I had the scans I was told to lie very still like Sleeping Beauty. I remember my nurse leaning over from the head of the bed, so he was upside down to me, and saying oh, those beautiful eyes shouldn't be open yet. Hey guys, the princess is awake, she needs more magic air." That's what they called it when they put the mask on me to make me sleep. And I saw the mask come back over me and that was it until I woke up in recovery. It's strange, I wasn't scared at all, it didn't hurt at all, I was just like oh, I'm in the OR, cool.
By the way you didn’t answer a question
My mom woke up in the middle of getting her appendix removed with an asma attack. Not a fun experience for her.
Squid game
Was it Jared Kushner? 🤣
me watching the surgeons do surgery on me while I am in mind shattering agony : :|
I had a couple dental surgeries, one major one when I was little. I very vividly remember waking up to drilling, 3 people around me, the 2 to the sides freaking out and the man doing the surgery calmly saying “ah- you won’t remember this.” I remembered, sir!
The only thing true about this story is that he had a colon.
And is that the man who carried his colon in a bag? If so, I suspect he's still doing it. They call him NoGuts Kushner
As yes. I wake up and see the doctors taking out an organ. My first reaction is “I am speed”
Woke up in the middle of having my gall bladder removed , went full on zombie Frankenstein Got up off the table and the nurses had to wrestle me back on it My memory of it has a strobe effect I only remember every other second
my mom mentioned that during my surgery, the doctor stepped out to discuss something with my mom, and i don’t think he realized that he walked out covered in my blood. i feel bad for my mom knowing that she had to witness that
I woke up as a kid (approx. 5 years old) when the removed my polyps. As I lived in a country with a very shitty medical system, they just "finished the job quickly". I was was still so drugged, I didn't feel anything, but I remember them saying "Oh shit, she's waking up!", them going back to cutting around in my throat and me coughing up blood. Yeah. Nice experience, 10/10. It happens and it's not pretty. But I also had doctors pull out my fucking nail and sawing it back on without anestesia (wtf???) so I think I might have had bad experiences all around.
Bring a book!  It always helped me get back to sleep.
How TF he alive from that
Did you know, that people with (natural) red hair, have a higher chance of waking up during surgery?
My man woke up during surgery on his arm. He laughed and then they added more meds lol
Personally I'd swallow a Lego before surgery so that way they cut open my stomach and they find it I'll be like I wake up I'll be like oh wonder where that went
If you wake up during surgery, you're numb so you can't talk to tell the surgeons you woke up, but you can feel everything.
I've heard stories about ppl who woke up during surgery but they were completely paralysed and doctors didn't notice
At least the bag was reusable.
My dad went to a two start hospital and woke up SOME HOW while they eye removing his heart.
Breaking news man survives without intestines
I woke up while getting emergency foot surgery. They judt sat there talking to me while they worked. I couldnt feel anything so it didnt hurt but it was weird to be in the room. It was a 6 hour surgery and it was only about 3-4 hours in. They kept asking if it hurt which nothing did because i have a high pain tolerance and they numbed me many times. It was cool
HOPE  🙏😑 I’m trying to offer people Hope in absolute perfection !!!

The person spelled wake up wrong lol wale- but why would u wake up? Bc if u wake up then the Anastasia guy is abt to get fired bc he didn't give u enough
😐🤨😑
I thought u are in a certain state where u can not move but u can feel
So if you wake up in the middle of surgery you go shopping at the nearest LuLu Lemon store? Sounds oddly specific. But okay.
Satan reading these comments: haha oh hahaha!
my mom didn't wake up in the middle of surgery but when they were about to do a c-section they forgot to check if she was under anesthesia and just started snip snapping while she was awake. they ended it obviously noticing but i personally feel bad for putting my mother through that-
Yeah I'll just walk without any of my organs just all them in a bag
Dude, that's fucked up.
Waking up during my surgery gave me PTSD when they were cutting into my arm and decided to panick by overdosing the "nerve block" medication....till this day, I can happily jump off a moving helicopter to bungee jump,despite my fear of heights, rather than get another surgery..😭
I woke up during my colonoscopy. I felt like a dream, there was no pain.. I looked at the screen and said "sure is dark in there" that's the last thing I remember.. then I was in recovery
As someone who’s woken up you probably won’t even know you’re awake I woke up and heard everything they said hence how I knew I was up but they all looked like glow stick drawings and we was in a field of flowers I fell back to sleep after 30 seconds but yea
BRUH WHY DID I NEED TO KNOW THIS
What about the muscle relaxans you usually get before/during surgery?
What if you wake up in the middle of the heart transplant
Me: wakes up  Also me: should I be awake for this Doctors: well no, but as long as you are could you hold your rib cage open a bit?
*horrified face*
WHY
But.... that didn't answer the question.....????

You didn't actually answer the question you just told us a story about something. What does happen?
I did when I was two.. I had been rushed to the hospital for chewing on rat poison.. It caused me to have PTSD since.
Anyone go after him?!?!
This happened to my mum
My cousin had a surgery and he woke up whale surgery and he went back to sleep
Lie
When I had a surgery done I woke up in the surgery area they were done but I freaked out because I thought I woke up mid surgery
Not everyone will read that 1 sec clip text...don't do that or some people might even believe that joke
Live Organ Extraction Zhou was an experienced surgeon, testified Lu. But after participating in organ harvesting from Falun Gong practitioners several times, she stopped–the horrifying scenes often brought her nightmares.  During the procedures in which Zhou extracted organs, the victims screamed from the pain. Lu once asked why Zhou didn't give them anesthesia. “There are places that you do not want to apply anesthetics,” she explained, “especially those vulnerable organs.”  This form of live organ harvesting is totally different from transplantation involving brain-dead organ donors, as generally accepted by the medical community.  Lu's testimonies also confirmed that the victims, who were tied up when being pushed to operating rooms, were Falun Gong practitioners as they called out, “Falun Dafa is good!” This indicated at least two things: first, they were detained Falun Gong practitioners, not death-row prisoners as the CCP had claimed to be sources of organs until 2015. Second, they were healthy people with clear minds, not brain-dead donors.
IF I WAKE UP...AND SEE MY BODY CUT OPEN..JUST GIVE ME TWO MINUTES ...I WILL FAINT...AND YOU CAN CONTINUE...STOP PLAYING...OKKK. LOLLLLLLLL
This happened to my dad but the doctor woke him up during open HEART surgery to ask him what was wrong with him because his heart looked fine.
I woke up in the middle of being cut. 6 cc morphine I.V and 4 cc I.M. Out like a light, but I remember. Yes, I've had surgery since.

Depends on the surgery, if it’s like at your leg you might die of shock same for chest
Now that's a gut wrenching story.

Jared Kushner typo
Why is a picture of Jared mush er in the background? Was Jared the “young man” in the story?
How the heck he live with his intestines in a bag in not in him he should have died after the intestines came out
Wale up
The young man behind you was born with a pair of red horns and a red long tail with a very pointy black end
I ve woken up during surgery only real thing was noticed the pain from the hole in my chest then the surgeon realised i had come to and had to have another injection woke up on the ward about 40 minutes later nothing came of it i lived the wounds healed.

Hahaha true story 🤪🤣😂
When I had my C-section I remember sitting up swinging my legs over the Sid of the table and touching the cold floor with my toes all while saying it's not safe here I want to go home where it's safe. Then they pushed me back down and I was out. It's not the first time I woke up during anesthesia it is the 3rs time
What happens when you whale up
I know this is a joke but if you are that five year old that believed this was real then let me explain. When you wake up after the surgery you will feel tired and only after a while you will be awake. So if you woke up during a surgery you wouldn't get up. They would make you go sleepy sleepy again.
I’ve seen greys anatomy about 7-9 times and I believe that it doesn’t happen often and you usually won’t remember it but if you do it’s traumatic 😃 but if the anesthesia wears off they’ll try to fix it immediately..
Um are you sure
I've woke up during every surgery I ever had. Apparently once I screamed & scared the Dr
I would imagine it would be very painful
On the other end, I was gonna pass out giving birth but they gave me the shot up the spine and wouldn’t let me 😔
I woke up during my knee replacement surgery,  the surgeon was pounding on my knee with hammer and chisel (I'm guessing). All that banging woke me up lol
If you wale up it's painful
That's not a answer We asked what happens not what happened before
My mom woke up during surgery and she had one of the breathing tubes in. She looked over to one of the nurses and then the trashcan and saw lots of blood. They put her back to sleep and she woke up in a hospital bed.
The image of a man coming into the hospital with his LITERAL INTESTINES in a bag is metal as hell.
Thanks for sharing we all want to know that BLAH BLAH BLAH
I kinda woke once and heard them talking about it and then I was out. I've had dozens of surgeries and have never had dreams, so I assume that this was towards the end? I'm a redhead and I've heard they are harder to knock out  I felt nothing. It was all very fast.
Oh my-- Why the hel- Why he ran away, his abdomen is legit exposed- how the hell he survived that oh my goodness-  Imagine people who were just simply passing by saw that...... Oh dear 0-0
its wale up
It terrifies me how many stories are in this comment section about waking up during surgery.
I've woken up but was awake maybe 10 sec and went back out
Isn't that Jared Kushner?
I got put to sleep for my wisdom tooth surgery & ended up waking up & all i heard was oh shit! 😂😂 i laughed & went back to sleep 😂😂
🙂🔫
See hospitals are scary lol
I had a boob job six months ago and was awake 60% of the time. It was one of the worst experiences of my life. Doctor and nurse were listening to music, talking, gossiping... I could see everything was OK. The problem is that it lasted around 5h and I was bored to death and my arm and leg were sleeping, feeling weird. Everytime the anesthesiologist came near me I'd ask him to PLEASSSEEEE give me something to sleep. I slept after she was already working on the second boob. What an experience
What. The fuck.
Not funny
My dad woke up when the doctors took out a tube from his neck and they said 150 cc of this and he went night night
Running out of the hospital probably not the best idea
What happens if you wale up in the middle of surgery  Speech 100
Well just believe anything an Asian says at this point🤣
You that happened to me when the doctors were putting a stint on my heart. I opened my eyes, saw my doctor and asked " Are we done" and the doctor said " shit she's awake.... and I fell asleep again. Yes. True story.
pain
My mom actually woke at her surgery to remove her gall bladder and remember the doctors talking about pizza, but fell sleep again, only listened them and felt they moving something on her body. When she woke again, after the surgery, asked if was true and they said it was… i would die
That reminds me of that Grey's anatomy episode where it happened to a woman and she sued the hospital
Thanks doc now we have a new phobia
That's why kids u shouldn't do drugs.... Drugs affect the effect of anesthesia and normal quantity of anesthesia don't work on drug addicts therefore miscalculations happen
I woke up in the middle of a neurofibroma removal from my rib cage. They were as surprised as me and then they apparently "gave me more" anesthesia.
I woke up during surgery when they were fixing the compound fracture on my arm.  I wasn't fully awake and all I remember was the surgeon looking down at me shocked and I said "I'm thirsty" although from talking to them I just made noises and fell back asleep
That happened to my dads friend but with his leg not removing but you get it he woke up screaming and it scared the crap out of the doctors
I had my insides pulled out for a ileostomy. Sure glad I didn't wake up during surgery, however my insides are still sticking out... 😅
I had surgery when I was 6. Hernia. Mom said I woke up and talking to the doctor. Lol 😂
R u fucking joking me??
Him going back to the hospital: hey uh can you put this back in *holding a bag with his intestines in it*
Why would he run and shouldnt he be dead right now
This has to be fake 😭😭

Crazy how I got this video above a surgery skit
Now I'm scared 👍

So fake
Are you afraid of death?   Read this carefully for the cure ;   Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross. In doing so, his blood was shed to wash us clean of our transgressions . Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’ .
When I came out of surgery, I was in a fight with four security guards.  They had to lock my ankles to the gurney and re-sedate me.
I've also woken up during my disc removal surgery....I could hear someone say, "Oh-oh." And every movement in my body stopped...hands on my spine....the doctor yelling "Put her back under jackass!!" Not reassuring...I couldn't move....
well im pretty sure if u wale up itd be dangerous, but idk about waking up
Before I read the little side note saying it has never happend I almost through up!
I wokeup during eye surgery, screamed, they knocked me back out. The end .
I woke up during a colonoscopy and saw the screen he was using to see ..well... inside me lol and said something like wow that's what it looks like then made hard eye contact with the doc for a few seconds before he looked over my head popped an eyebrow and the last thing I heard was the anesthesiologist chuckle and mutter something like "... seriously shes cranked..." then I woke up in recovery lol... they should have expected that since I got nervous as I was being doped and kept asking questions and cracking jokes fighting the drugs. Doc kept smirking and telling me to close my eyes and stop talking, the anesthesiologist finally had to drape a cloth over my eyes and he patted my damn head like a baby and started counting down in a quite voice and it was lights out for me until I woke up again 🤣
I like to wale up to
Normal people: It's ok, i'll just go back to sleep Him: I NEED THE LULU LEMON BAG
It's fine if you know how to fall asleep fast *But for the people who can't fall asleep fast....*
I'd be more afraid of waking up but being paralyzed and feeling everything
Bruh I got scared of this vid I had surgery yesterday
What does this have to go with Jared Kushner ?
U sue the hospital and dr and fill that bag with money how stupid
He changed his mind
456...
ummm
Wale can't even spell 🤣🤣🤣🤣
My dad woke up while they were replacing/remodeling his forehead (bashed in after car accident). He apparently heard them say something about being carefull on a the ustensil replacing the forehead and he said "yes please I can feel it" then went back to sleep. It was in the 70s and they thought he was in a coma so they must have underdosed him
Ah yes  The pain inhibitors
YIKES!!!....
My mom woke up when her wisdom teeth were getting taken out
Patient waking up from surgery: wha - what happened? A nurse with a cartoonishly large hammer at the head of the operaing table: dont worry abt it
What's scarier than waking up is anesthesia awareness. It's rare but you are paralysed yet conscious. You still feel pain and can do nothing about it
At first I  was like makes sense then 3 sec later: nah you woulnt be able to move
Omg
I woke up during heart surgery. Mitral valve repair. I remember every moment until they all yelled "She's awake!" You literally cannot die. You are on a machine to breath and a machine to make your blood flow.
my friends dad is an anaesthesiologist and he had someone wake you in surgery, asking for a glass of water. Everyone stopped dead in their tracks, it was a big moment. He was just put back to sleep, and he didn’t remember anything about it afterwards.
Woke up during my tubal ligation surgery. My Dr said I didn't & I told him about conversation with other Dr in room about "do you know where to get a VCR repaired?" (Yes it was 32 yrs ago). He was 😳🤯
This doctor is a pervert.
Wow i feel much better about going into surgery now...
They would just put you back to sleep I think.
I woke up in the middle of getting my tonsils removed but that was 5 years ago
I woke up while the doctors are stitching up my tummy after a surgery. I briefly saw my insides. 😆
He left the oven on.
That is terrifying.
When you wake up scream in pain to scare the shit out of the doctor and nurses :) the anesthesiologist will crank that thing up to 11 >:P
I like to imagine they have a bat incase they wake up and just say they administerd more drugs
My daughter did during heart surgery at age 7 she still has ptsd from it traumatized still
“Carrying his intestines in a Lulu Lemon bag”  excuse me     w  h  a  t
Apparently this happened to me when I was very small. They were removing my tonsils and I woke up crying. The doctor very nervously informed my mom and she was scared, but I don’t remember a thing!
Ok but he doesn't answer the question, just an unrelated one. What happens when you wale up during surgery?
The amount of people in the comments that woke up during surgery is alarming
Did he die
Instead of weak it was wroten wale
That's why there is a guy with a brick there, nothing faster than a brick to put you back to sleep
If we hear even a peep out of the patient, we will usually just give more anesthesia lol
Fuck this, this vid makes me want to take care of my self.
Heck if I woke up , I would just start screaming
My dad woke up during surgery.. Hernia repair(not laparoscopic.. REAL hernia surgery).. He said he informed them and they put him back to sleep. 1. He's the toughest person I know, and 2. He's an MD, so MAYBE that made him more able to stay calm.. I have no idea, but I hope anesthesia resistance isn't genetic!
Simple you punch them to sleep due to scaring the daylights out of the doctors
The fact that we call this one boy in My class Lu Lu lemons is funny 🤣
*Why does he kinda look like the main character in squid game*
Dosent awnser the qestion
My mother woke up once during surgery when she was getting her womb removed. She said it didn’t hurt but it was scary and they immediately put her back to sleep
Some dumbass will think its true.
That's one of my biggest fear. Getting eye surgery and waking up to that😬😬
I have twice & was awake but totally paralyzed during 2 different 5+ hour surgerys years ago when they out in then took out a Medtronic infusion pump.  I was totally screaming in my head. I'll never, evet, evet, ever forget it..it was to horrible.
I woke up during my Wisdom tooth surgery, I remember seeing the two dentists moving my tongue around and then I was asleep again. You can see on the bill two different charges for it lol
In 2011 I woke up while doctors were trying to stop the bleeding from an open wound on my throat after my then gf sliced it by throwing a beer glass at the wall
Back in the 90s, my dad woke up multiple times during his shoulder replacement. They kept giving him more anesthesia but he kept waking up. They had to give him so much that they accidentally OD'ed him and he stopped breathing for a bit. He remembers waking up and hearing pure panic in the room with docs telling him to breathe, and he could actually talk to them saying "I'm not breathing?!" He got scared when he saw his arm open and started tearing equipment off him. Eventually the docs got the situation fixed. My dad and I both agree that the docs gave him so many drugs because the surgery was so intense he could NOT be awake for it. After the surgery multiple doctors came to him saying how odd it was that the anesthesia had little affect on him. He says it was a hellish experience that he wishes on no one.
My dad woke up in the middle of his hip replacement and proceeded to argue with the doctor about getting his hip bone. He said ( it's mine dammit).
I could wake up during surgery, but the sight of the doctors and the sharp equipment would knock me out again. 😭
Typo on wake up and says wale up
I woke up during surgery and was in AGONY.  They were suturing deep deep tissue in my left lower back.  I said, "they have to stop" to the anesthesiogist sitting at my head.  She said, "stop what?"  I said, "suturing"  she LEAPT up and yelled, "she knows what you are doing!!"    Meanwhile it was like two searing pieces of flesh being jammed together, just on fire.  I felt like I was trying to push through the bed to the floor to get away from them.    As she yelled that the room collectively took a step back...they all kind of lean on you and have hands and tools resting...I felt the quick space as ppl stepped off.  The main surgeon said, lidocaine and the fellow (I imagine anyway) stepped in with lido in the area.   They  later figured out it was a kink in my IV line and I stopped getting meds to keep me out.    The doc later blamed me for being on some meds that made it hard to treat me but that's not how anesthesia works, that jerk.    I actually woke up again near the end while the fellow was stapling.  That's when she was messing with my hand to unkink the IV.  I said  he has to stop, I can't.  She repeated.  I said no more staples  he said almost finished and STAPLED FIVE MORE QUICK ONES.   I can still feel that agony in raw open flesh.  And the whole line of staples was a jumbled mess, a really poor showing.    And although many ppl would forget all that under the meds, I was very much awake and aware.     It started with the computers down that day so the nurses were scurrying with docs just waiting.  The old anesthesiologist who likely hadn't put an IV in 30 years decided he would do the IV when the nurse couldn't get it right away.   In retrospect I should have spoken up,  give the two nurses 3 minutes and some privacy without 3 docs and 4 fellows watching.  But I had NO idea what I was in for, how could u ever predict that?!?   So yeah, now I have panic attacks at every procedure and therapist for PTSD.  That doc prob doesn't even remember....ugh.  (although the lady at my head might remember, she prob thinks I dont.)  Should have reported the incident to someone who matters but I was in agony recovering so...it just didn't happen.    I would have forgone any legal preceding just to have the audio of that OR session... that was awful.
I’m sorry babes what ?!”carrying his intestines in a LULU LEMON bag”
Well I always go for spinal with sedation and if it's g.a better make sure that the anesthesiologist is not pissed at you.... Well just go to an extra length by them a drink...( * _*)
Ewwwww
I think it doesn't count as waking up during operation, but when I had one on my abdomen I dreamd that I was standing above myself like a ghost and watching a guy kicking and punching my stomach for forever. I felt pain and pulling at that time. When I woke up after operation, they told me there was a problem and the operation took much more time than it needed. Something bad happened but nobody said what exactly. I'm scared as hell when it comes to doctors and hospitals. Especially operations. Before mine I was crying in fear for whole 2 days. When I read about people waking up during their operations I feel like I'm gonna faint or throw up. If I will ever in my life need another surgery I think I will die mentally
My mom woke up in the middle of surgery when they were working on nerves in her hand she couldn’t feel anything but she still remembers it to this day
We’re friends?
I woke up under anesthesia once during a spinal tap. I thought it was over and i asked my mom what was going on, my vision was blurry and I remember not knowing how to talk. I just mumbled things and I managed to get out, “mom my back hurts”. I remember reaching back to feel it, then my hand was stopped and i felt tired so i went back to sleep.  So to answer your question, its very peaceful. My back was only in mild pain and it wasn’t scary.
someone was actually awake while being operated on, the nurses didnt give the anesthesia effect thing the right way and he didnt fall asleep, he said it was like "Torture.", he felt every single thing done to his body.
My surgeon was repairing my leg and ankle and foot. I woke up because they did not think it was going to take as long as it did it was 3 or 4 hours extra. And I remember him looking down at me and it didn't phase him because he has years of experience he stood the director of that department. He just smiled and then you looked at the anesthesiologist and said you need to put her under again. End of story
😂🤣😂🤣😂
I woke up during a dnc I had thank goodness they put me right back under so the pain didn't last too long but oh yea that pain was awful. 😪
I blame the anesthesiologist. They should know better and give the right kind or combination of anesthesia including right dosage.If the surgery is long or extensive , they should use general anesthesia or the one that would last longer . I always tell my doctor or medical staff to make sure to restrain my arms in case I wake up during surgery and try to punch or kick the surgeon.😂✌️
He woke up and ran away from surgery and ended up carrying his intestines and coming back. I have never been this confused and scared in my life.
How in the hell was he able to run out the hospital? Especially when they’re suppose to be attached to Machines
If you wake up we’re gonna knock you out
I did wake up during my tonsil removal surgery.I opened my eyes almost threw up and then went back to sleep
The comment didn't say "wake" they say "wale"
Knock me back out
Um...so don't come for me. But I did wake up in the middle of my knee surgery 😫 😩  You see I was pregnant and I slipped and tore my acl and piece of miniscus disk broke off and slid in-between my kneecap so I couldn't extend my leg. I stayed like that for like 2 weeks unable to extend my leg completely which is TORTURE  So I had to have surgery when I was pregnant and I had to be put under and I woke up and they had all the laperscopic tools sticking out of my leg and I sat up and swung a leg off and tried to pull my stuff out and the doctor screams what the hell is she doing and then they must have gave me more meds because I tried to yell back that I was getting the fuck out of there but I got one finger up was all aiya- aiya aiya......and when I woke up and screamed omg I had the worst dreams that I was awake in surgery and they said um no maAm...there were some complications with your anesthesia and we had to give you more bc we tried to give you less for the baby but that didn't work out so.....ya I have ptsd now....like really bad bur there is a window small  between 16 and 22 weeks when nothing significant is developing in a fetus so you can undertake anesthesia or else I would have been forced to wait until I delivered and been in agony so ya....the surgery was the beginning of a life time of knee surgery and pin pills Nd I need a total knee replacement know at 38...I was 22 at the time
What the FU-      Person has disconnected...
Thanks now i cant sleep
I woke up while they were inserting my left breast implant...I could feel a little pain and pressure. They asked where? I motioned on my left side and they put me back to sleep.
my brother woke up while the doctor was stiching him up, so he accidentally kicked the doctor
Uhhh
I woke up in the middle of a 1hr surgery and asked if they were done yet. Heard several "what the fuck" and someone told me to go back to sleep. So I did. Got asked afterwards if I had red hair. I don't.
That is...terrifying. My mom has woken up several times in sugary.
Lmaoooo
Well if that ant the funniest thing I have herd in 2021 idk what is
Why weren't they able to catch him before he got out of the hospital?
And he was like: “Yo, I brought food…..sike”
So what you’re implying is Jared Kushner jumped off the operating table in the middle of surgery??
I woke up during surgery as a child while they were drilling into my elbow
Top tip: if you wake up during surgery, scream
I woke up during my wisdom teeth removal. The tech would pull my teeth and hand them to me and I would inspect them like it was a foreign object
Love how you had a photo of Jared kushner
my mom woke up in the middle of a surgery for her toes
This is what happens when you wake up everyday
My dad once woke up during a surgery, one time we walked past the hospital he went to and told me he didn't like being there
If anyone wants to know what is written as it was written the end it is - Just Kidding I have performed 1000's of surgery under general anesthesia and I never had a person wake up during the surgery
Actually doctors will know before you even wake up. You heart rate will rise when your about to wake up. Doctors will just boost the anesthesia levels and put you back to sleep/unconsciousness   Don't be scared of anesthesia awareness it's extremely rare
Haha I already woke up, doctor just continued and I wasn’t feeling pain, but I was feeling my skin, it was weird af
Anyone who wakes up during surgery may try to figure out whats happening, but they have no energy or body control to jump and run off so basically you are helpless.
I'd say "a little to the left please" just to freak them out
Or you wake up, scare the surgeon and get punched square in the face knocking you out instantly.
Something scarier than waking up is not having the anesthesia properly balanced. Resulting in the possibility that you could be conscious, and feel everything, but you can't move or speak to let anyone know. There was a case where a guy was having something done with his leg, that required breaking the bone. He was completely aware of the entire operation, and later sued and won.
Ahhhhhh
I was waking up during an eye surgery, doctors said something along the lines of:she’s waking up, add more __. Then I fell asleep, nothing bad happened
Yeah, but what happens if you wale up during surgery? I don't even know what waling is, so please inform me
This guy is a genius. People asked this question in hopes of listening to a f-ed up story like this and he answered their concerns.
Now that's what I call in medias Res
Oh good
I was bleeding out during my son's c-section and vomited and stopped being able to move or talk and they thought I was asleep but could hear everything. Was really scary
I experienced that before i was in a middle of a surgery then i woke up but i wanted to see what were they doing and the doctor kind of scolded me:')
Why would he run ? Dumbass
I was thinking about oliver tree lol
My father went through an entire heart operation. He was a little stressed.
How did you learn english?
my mom had this yelled at the surgion went back to sleep surgion was scared of my mom
It's the lulu lemon bag for me
In this incident with the surgeon be sued or the anesthesiologist
No way....
Do you feel pain if you wake up??
Years ago I woke up through 2 separate surgeries.  One I tried to leave.   Both times were very frightening.  Since then I've told the doctors and anesthesiologist every time ( I'm older) and this has never occurred again.   A younger anesthesiologist reassured me that they now have an  EKG strip they place on your forehead to monitor your level of consciousness.   Im very thankful for that.   Merry Christmas Dr and all of y'all!🌟🙏🎁💜🎄
I woke up while having foot surgery i screamed sooo loud they put me back under quickly.
I wish I was there to watch this all go down
You know along time ago  to have people do the sleepy thingy they would start the surgery and they would pass out
Mood
I've woken up a couple times.  Unfortunately I'm very resistant to anesthesia and have a lot of medical issues.  The scariest time was when I was having a procedure in and around my spine so I was knocked out and tied down.  The doctor was one I'd been seeing for years but I didn't get a good feeling about the anesthesiologist because he very obviously blew me off.  Well I woke up mid-procedure.  I don't panic but that time I did panic.  I started moving, crying etc WHILE MY SURGEON HAD INSTRUMENTS AGAINST MY SPINE!!!  My surgeon had to talk to me while a nurse was calming me down so the anesthesiologist could knock me out again.  I heard my Dr ripping the anesthesiologist apart as I fell back asleep and my Dr apologized to me about it.  I kept seeing that Dr but never saw the anesthesiologist again.
So if i wake up I will run away and come back with my intestines in a bag
What happens is that there will be a massive lawsuit. This is called medical malpractice.
I like how there's a lot of people saying they woke up during surgery, it happens more than you'd think
That is one of my worst fears. Waking up in middle of a surgery. To me, It's scarier than dying from a surgery
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
is that Jared?
My daddy was supposed to have a 1 inch incision for a hernia and had an 8 inch one because they removed his Xiphoid process bone. He woke up while the surgeons hand was in his chest. He liked around. They said he awake. The doctor said he won’t wake up again. They killed him. Brought him back. But still killed him. We both have immunity to pain medication and high drug tolerance. I was 72 pounds taking the max legal dose of vivance. Meant to last a300 pound man 24 hours. And knock him on his ass the whole time. It lasted me at 72 pounds. 5 1/2 hours. And barely did anything while it did. So that explains that.
Sleep again and never wake up
Well he said what happens if u "wale" up not "wake" up....
Uuuuuuuuugh.         that's chilling me down the spine.
Yes wale up
I've heard so much shit before that I wouldn't be surprised I f this was a true story lmao
Every surgery I ever had I have woken up up when I got my cancer out of my bus when I got my overcanceled when I did my copatino surgery I woke him up in every surgery even when I was 9 and I did my tonsils out why is that
I woke up in the middle of getting my wisdom teeth removed... I didnt open my eyes but everyone sounded scared af like it's ok you're gonna be just fine go back to sleep.... very weird but I did just that😂😂
That's disgusting. I just ate and now I want to vomit
Still don't explain why just some stupid story once again
How is he not dead
my grandma woke up during surgery. said it didn’t hurt, she could feel them moving things around but it wasn’t painful. she fell back asleep too
That looks like t man's son in law
It happen tho I heard people say "fuck" during my brain surgery and went sleep soon after.
I woke up during my spleen removal surgery, interesting core memory maker
"You're not supposed to be awake! While you're here though, could you hold your ribcage open a bit?"
Heavy: *damn, must have been reading the directions wrong*
Ngl, you had us in the first half😂
Dude must be like oh fk I forgot to off the gas
wtf
Was it painful
Why did you use a photo of Jared Kushner as an example here
It actually happened to my mom. She thought she was being kidnapped and she threw these weight on her to keep her steady and the doctor grabbed her face and said "YOU DON'T MOVE" then she knocked out again.
I woke up from having a bone marrow biopsy done and looked around confused as I had an 9 inch needle sticking out of my hip. I asked what happened and they told me they poked through a blood vessel. I started to panic about it while going back under. I was 11 years old at the time and have a 3 inch scar from it now..
Thanks for the advice
Mid surgery: Ight ima head out
STOPP
No, i think he asked what happens if you turn to a whale in mid surgery.
Oh yeah I've heard of this horrible thing during surgery so it's like when you become conscious that you feel all the pain asif you weren't on anesthetics but the worst part is you can't move your body at all so you're just frozen there feeling all the pain. I forget what it's called but it sounds terrible, I've had like 8 surgeries to battle cancer like: having an omia resovoir put in my skull, a feeding tube into my stomach because I kept vomiting up my NG's just to name a few. So I'm really scared and worried everytime I go in for surgery
How did he run away 😭 i mean the security at the hospital couldn't get him?
The way he says: true story
I woke up in the middle of surgery and I instantly threw up. They immediately put me back under. Glad I was on my belly.
I would love to see smb Wale 🐋 up
They just whack you in the face with a sledgehammer.
Unfortunately what usually happens is you cannot move or speak and the doctors have no idea you are conscious.  However someone I used to know once woke up screaming. It turns out she needs more anesthesia than the average person (she has clEDS and some people with EDS do not process anesthesia in the same way).
My aunt's anesthesia didn't work so she could feel the doctors taking a part of her liver out :(
Get the hammer.
I woke up in the middle of my appendectomy and I was so frustrated because I wanted to watch the whole thing but the drape was preventing me from doing it. The doctors and nurses were laughing lmao I guess they didn't expect a 15-year-old to be that gore XD But the head surgeon knew that it was my dream to become a doctor and so, they just told me to watch the reflection on the ceiling instead. After the surgery, the head surgeon showed me my appendix which they had just removed and damn, I was all smiles lmaoooo had a blast, tbh lol.
Umm did he live ?
Just saw a story a few weeks ago of a person that didn't get the right gas and just got paralyzed instead of sleeping so he felt everything but couldn't scream or move any body parts (while they did a surgery on his belly) and that's torture.
Did Jared Kushner wake up during surgery?
Ngl he had me in the first half
What if you don’t have a lulu lemon bag?
I woke up getting pins surgically implanted in my funny bone after I broke it. Literally in the middle of surgery I’d woken up and all I remember is the doctors telling me “shh go back to sleep, you’re okay” and I fell back asleep lmao. Those guys did well 😂
I've woken up during different procedures and have had various outcomes depending on what was being done and when I woke up   I was fully sedated for some intense dental work, I woke up, they told me nonononono go back to sleep and I just said O K And passed out again. Nothing bad happened 10/10   I woke up during a scope of my upper gi and that was really uncomfortable but luckily they got me back under quickly. 7.5/10 but I would do it again bc I got ~health issues~   I dont even remember what they were doing in my lungs but I went to see  pulmonology and they had to put me under to do something, they told me I wouldn't be able to remember or feel a thing and that was some bullsh!t. I felt everything they were doing n I still remember it and never wanna go though that again 1/10   And for the hell of it i wasn't under for this one, this just sucked, but I have scars on my chest and I had my plastic surgeon smooth down some of the scar tissue in office. It was weird kinda feeling the skin being cut off but not really feeling it. That part wasn't that bad,it was kinda cool 8/10. Seeing it was horrifying and made me almost pass out 🤠 seeing "football" 🏈  shaped pieces of myself under my skin was a sight that haunts me to this day
😱😱😱🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢😨😨😱😱😱🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤢😱😱😱🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮 what eeeewwwww
This actually happened to my mama (she didn’t run away tho)
I woke up during cataract surgery. No fun.
I hope he at least got himself a nice new pair of leggings while he was out
If I woke up in the middle of the surgery, I would watch them do my organs
There was a lawsuit where a guy woke up but was still unable to move. He could feel everything and was in pain. He sued the hospital.
I woke up during an emergency extraction of all 4 wisdom teeth and vaguely remember talking to the aliens who had abducted me and saying how nice their spaceship was especially since it had pictures on the walls.
I remember I woke up during my wisdom teeth getting taken out.   I remember a big light. Someone looking at me and saying "Give him some more" and that's it. It's 100% possible that I dreamt it, but that's whats in my memory~
I also woke up in a middle of a colonoscopy. I felt the apparatus (whatever it was) for a moment and the nurse and doctor were surprised!  I was only 22 maybe they have underestimated my dosage 😅.
Blablablabla
Woke up while the doc was hammering away on a chisel in my nose
Guys guys, He just only ran away from the hospital cause he needs to attack in Clash of Clans, like come on he needs to do it.
Dude probably thought he was a zombie.
I've woken up in surgery once. I was having ACL surgery, your knee if you don't know. I came to and I was crying. I don't know why but I was. The nurse was rubbing my hand and face to calm me down and I remember the feeling of the needles in my hip even to today. They have to start there and work their was down numbing it
like the movie the island!
Woken up a couple of times... i remember trying to pull tube out of my nose... they knocked me out.  Hopefully this time with anaesthetic and not a punch!!!🤭
lmao i'd be like "um can yall gas me up again thanks"
Gotta have style
I've never had an invasive surgery, but I HAVE had many cavities and this many fillings. Literally every time I went - to the same dentist no less - I would have to have them shoot me up at least twice more to not feel the pain. It was just numbing stuff, nothing that would knock me out, but it royally sucked to have to wince in pain after they would just... Go at it even after I told them it wouldn't be enough to do a single dose. Again: this was my REGULAR DENTIST. These guys had filled my teeth more than I'd like to admit and still I got these looks of "Really? I'll believe it when I see it". They had seen it! Literally every time!   Happy ending: I found a new, way better dentist who actually did good fillings (another nightmare story from this same dentist) and actually listens to me when I asked them to numb me more. My deepest sadness was having to move out of state so I can't see them anymore
Jesus Christ called people everywhere to repent, therefore, if you confess with your lips the Lord Jesus and believe with all your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved and inherit the Kingdom of Heaven and eternal life. told other people how good he is, how he saves, heals and liberates and gives eternal life7
Noice what happens when you wale up
Honestly I refuse to believe I can fall asleep with medicine
I woke up while they were taking out my appendix. As soon as I heard the surgeon say "We're done! Sew her up." I passed out again 👍🏼
I woke up while my tonsils were being removed. I remember I started feeling excruciating pain in my throat and that the doctors had their hands shoved down my throat. I tried to scream, but felt like I was being chocked. The doctor yelled, “She’s awake! More anesthesia now!!”
My biggest fear is having surgery and even more so waking up DURING surgery. So i am reading these comments like,  😀
Even if you do wake up you won’t remember any of it and won’t feel anything
I woke up once the nurse looked at me then I was out
I woke up because of this genetic condition I have that certain meds dont work I just remember hearing lay down dont move then I knocked out again....I was having a hysterectomy done
Oh boy
What the fuck ,that dudes got balls of steel!
I woke up during surgery once. And that's how I lost my medical license.
Body packers are crazy.
He didn't want to go to jail, when they found a kilo in his stumach, so he ran out to hide the dope.
I looked for an hour, trying to find out if this really happened, and who it was. Didn't find anything like this story, but I found out that waking up during surgery, is more common than we would like to think
Thats next level ads right there
Who is this guy?? I'd like to look it up
Waking up during a surgery is alright as long as you don't feel the cuts they're doing in your body  BUT waking up during a surgery AND feeling everything they're currently doing to your body sounds like torture in hell
Woke up during my wisdom teeth extraction. Too scared to move or talk so could only communicate by blinking and crying. Felt the pressure of everything and a decent amount of pain, especially because I have bad TMJ and the doctor didn’t close my jaw occasionally like he was supposed to. Eventually I was white knuckling it and the nurses finally noticed. Then told him. He said I was not awake and was fine. I started grunting otherwise; he snapped at the nurse for mentioning it again. It was traumatizing. Son of a bitch had the nerve to send me the bill still. Also he called me dramatic at my follow up when I explained the amount of pain I was in. F that guy.
I woke up just before surgery started they put me under for a c section then as they were about to cut me open i woke up and thought i heard my mum and started yelling out for her and asking where she was then they put me back under and i remember as i was going under they said hold her arms and it repeated in my head for like 10 minutes till i was  out.
Omg this makes me so uncomfy
im getting spine surgery in a few weeks, and this is now a new fear of mine! 😇
Thats horrible. My friend woke up in surgery and the put him on medicine before the operation so when he woke up he couldnt move, talk, or do anything. He had to sit through it
A lot of people might have missed that "Just kidding" dialogue box at the end. And I'm laughing imagining it 🤣
What happens if you pee while sergry
How could they not catch him??
🤢
My mom did 👌
This is Like saying I've walked across the street thousands of times amd never been hit by a car.
I woke up during the bone graft and implant of my dental implant. My legs were shaking like i was having a seizure and for the next 10 minutes i focused on not moving and keeping my legs still. I couldnt feel anything but I can still hear the sound of him cutting into my jaw bone the drilling into the bone and when he was scraping my jawbone to create a good surface for the bone graft to graft on to. I never was so relieved to feel him stiching my gums knowing it was over lol.
Woke up during hand surgery. Much commotion, but I was strapped down and out again quickly.
Yeah he wised up real quick
I did* I jumped up…
Ive woke up twice,  2 different surgeries. I could have never jumped up because of  paralytics.. Guess they didnt use that then..
That's enough internet for me.
i remember i had surgery on my chest once. as much as i wasn't scared, i still feared a LOT that i was gonna wake up during surgery but thank god i didnt.
I like how everyone in the comments has woke up during surgery.😂🤣
wouldn't the man just  die ? real doctors pls explain
Ok No way???!?!?!?!?!!!!!!?!?!?!
Oh no
Man: Gets up and runs away The surgeons and hospital staff: Well I have a busy schedule if he needs it hell be back🤷‍♀️
I heard you win a free kiss from the surgeon.
We give you more versed or propofol
If you wake up that much in the middle of a surgical procedure, you have a really crappy anesthesiologist 😬
I remember I was in a terrible car accident a few years ago with my mom and sister, I ended up with a broken leg and neck. The doctors put a tube down my throat when they put me to sleep. I ended up waking up before they were down doing something to my leg, I tried to talk and scream but I couldn't which scared me so much, luckily without even knowing I fell right back to sleep😕
Same I woke up and they had to tie me down three times they drugged me so much but I still woke up in the middle of surgery
I woke up during my endo operation. I started throwing up, doc said I eas moving too much and said "it hurts it hurts". I don't remember that. But after the vomit episode I saw a lady with a needle and fell alseep again.
that is the biggest lie I have ever heard
I woke up in the middle of surgery and asked for a cup of water, my mouth was dry from the intubation. The doctors just pushed me back down and gave me more gas. Super scary because I was 11.
Jared kushner lol
this doesnt explain what happens lol. this is just a story of someone who experienced it. can u actaully explain what happens?
You don’t contribute to society please stop making videos and get a life. Thank you
Agh, that sounds terrifying. I have never done a surgery before, but if I ever need to have to go through one, I will beg the doctors and surgeons to make sure I will be asleep with whatever drug they use for that.
So this is something that scares me— going in for a surgery and waking up during it. But my fear is that I won’t be able to move or say anything but I’ll feel everything that happening.
It
Yeah but doesn’t hurt
Anesthesiologist here. People often mistaken recall from a general anesthetic vs from a sedation. There are 5 levels of sedation and one would expect to be possibly semi aware for at least four of the five. With general anesthesia, it is not expected for recall to happen and when it does, it should be taken seriously. It is now a rare occurrence due to safety mechanisms in place but human error, equipment failure or sometimes plain dumb luck can still happen. Patients often tell me they remembered stuff from a nursing sedation (which is not delivered by an anesthesiologist) and I reply, yes…that is the point. If you were any deeper, you could stop breathing and they would not be equipped or trained to rescue you properly. If you want a deeper sedation, you need an anesthesiologist; we are trained to use much more powerful medications.
Imagine getting your leg amputated but you wake up and try to run
I know waking up during a surgery happens, but this story didn't lol. How come nobody tried to stop him? Security? 🤔 makes no sense lol
Fun fact wake is spelled it was spelled  wale
Bruh wat did this fool think was going to happen if he ran around like a headless chicken in this moment
What if you wale up
I genuinely believed that until the lulu lemon bag.
Did he die
Anthony is being a doctor Hard? Because i want to be a doctor when am older
I might of woken up once in a surgery, because I was getting operated on when I was like 5 and started kicking the doctors, and when I woke up the asked me if I remember kicking the doctors and I lied and said no because I was scared of what they were going to do to me if I had said yes. I also remember getting really mad about them only having grape popsicles.
Happens quite often unfortunately.
Happened to me lol I destroyed most of the theater before I got jabbed in the butt
I woke up once during penis enlargement surgery.... i was disappointed for more than 1 reason
Cause if they wake up  BAM! 👊💥💫 right in the kisser
It wasn’t a surgery, but years ago I was under anesthesia for a stomach study and although I didn’t wake up, I was fighting against the doctor and the nurse lol. Literally, I was like trying fighting them and throwing jabs and kicks because I thought it was a kidnapping. Maybe that anesthesia wasn’t too strong lol. Then they had tu put more anesthesia.
I have! They gave me anesthesia and I woke up tripping balls … for days! Like looney toons hallucinations. I was a child. I saw walls closing in. Anvils dropping and some damn cows in the pool
Hey, a family member from the extended family died from lack of painkiller. He had a brain surgery and it was successful. But the doctor didnt keep an eye on him after the surgery, so he didnt have enough painkiller, he was in pain and banging his head until he fell into a coma. The doctor us still nowhere to be seen. After maybe few days of coma he passed.
This cavalier approach seems unfair and dismissive. Especially since there are documented cases of it happening.
Funny Story:  I woke up during a Hernia Operation with the cute nurse at my head pushing into me with her "muff" and I got aroused, with the doctor telling someone to "hold me down" as I was having visions of a "sweet angel" and my "woody" was getting in the way with my intestines exposed...  boy all the nurses had big smiles the next 2 days during recovery...  8D
I give Spinal anaesthesia to my patient during surgery, so they are awake nd they chat with me usually while im operating on their tummy 😂
Are you afraid of death?   Read this carefully for the cure ;   Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross. In doing so, his blood was shed to wash us clean of our transgressions . Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.
I thought we would die if our intestines fell out
My mom did it too, mainly because she had red hair and redheads don’t use anesthesia for Long but she never felt pain
Did he survive
Fake story
I haven't gone that far, but have come too more than a time or too.
Wake up it's not the problem, FEEL something is.
Did he die?! I need to know!
Happened to my ex when they were removing his spleen. He remembered all of it
Ok
I was strapped down.  Not pleasant for a claustrophobic but I guess I understand
You scream like a manic on the floor
My mom is an eye surgeon (ophthalmologist) and most of the time the patient is awake during surgery. Take care of your eyes guys, the operation videos she watches at home made chills run down my spine.
Not true
Some people wake up but are paralyzed. They can't scream or even blink, feeling every slice and stitch.
Instead of rick roll, rock roll
I felt the dr cutting.  Luckily, he heard me, and upped the juice.
When I was getting my gallbladder removed I think I woke up. I remember seeing video of what they were doing inside of me. I'm obese so they had to use special tools to get through all the fat. I thought it was an out of body experience at first but I think I just woke up for a couple seconds. I didn't feel anything at all, I barely even remember being awake.
Urban tale? Is that Jared Kushner?
Are you the guy from squid game?
My uncle once had hand surgery because a brick fell and crushed his hand, so while they were doing surgery on his hand, he woke up and he literally tried to fight the surgeon, but I don’t know what happened after that
You should talk to my grandma about that, she was having a leg surgery or something and she woke up to the doctor with a hammer and banging the metal thingy in her leg, traumatizing moment for her
I woke up but not to that extent. I opened my eyes and then I guess they put me back to sleep?
You're fucked..LOLL
My mothers friend went in for heart surgery a couple of months ago and had to reschedule halfway through because she was awake during it(anesthesia didnt work) but couldn't talk with the tube down her throat. The doctors only noticed she was awake when a nurse saw her fingers moving.
Look at you trending!! WTG Doc ♥️
So if you wake up in the middle of surgery you’re going to go out with your colon hanging out and come back with it in a loo loo lemon bag???
Isn't anyone going to mention that was Jared Kushner ?
At least waking up is probably better than being awake but unable to move or tell anyone you can feel everything
My mam woke up during surgery her foot op but cuz her eyes was shut they didn't know then she asked if she's ment to be awake they said no they didn't believer her until she repeated what the doc was saying turns out my family actually need more of things like anathisia (idk how it's spelt) to actually knock us out and same wiv numbing injections at dentist I'm worse I need like 5-7 full injections for them to just deal wiv 1 tooth, meds all meds I and my mam have usually has to go on the max dose before it does even a slight thing and my doc once tried starting me on the max does first for my age which was 180mg and I ended up having a seizure because of it so they dropped it down to 120mg and I'm fine now lol but yeah fun not
If i know right there's a 1 to 250,000 chance to get up in a surgery
It happen to a french guy what he describe was horrible !!
My little sister woke up when her neck was cut open
Happens often I would say but docs will play it dumb so no lawsuits
I woke up getting my wisdom teeth removed. They were putting me to sleep and they were like "yeah we're giving you the good stuff" and i was like ok cool im gonna wake up with several less teeth. Then I remember screaming; my screaming, and just a real bad pain. I hear someone shouting "we need help in here!" I couldn't move. I couldn't open my eyes, I couldn't think, I could only feel pain, I could only scream. Then, nothing. I woke up, fell down on the way to the car and immediately puked when I got home. Remember to disclose if you smoke weed to your dentist. They give you the good stuff, but you're gonna need the better stuff.
My mom was fully awake and felt everything during a surgery in her spin to put in a spinal cord stimulator for pain due to her rare disorder they didn’t put her back to sleep even though the anesthesiologist assistant told them she wasn’t under she couldn’t move or talk but she could hear see and feel it all
No
If I wake up during surgery I’d freak out and probably mess up the surgery and cause more injuries.
Short answer A LOT OF PAIN but i don’t have experience
No it said wale up, get it right.
When I woke up on the operating table they told me to calm down and then put me back to sleep. I still have nightmares about it.
Omg he looks like the squid game guy gihun
I did wake up but did not open my eyes. I felt the intubation thing in my throat and the feeling was horrible. I was conscious but could not move. I fell back asleep.
I woke up during surgery when I was four. Long story short I'd been in a bad crash and my face was torn up. So I woke up while they were sewing my face back together. I went back under a few seconds later but despite having this distinct memory I apparently never told anyone and they were shocked and thought I was making it up when I brought it up recently
My mother wasn't fully unconscious during her pregnancy.She was having C section and felt the cut made by doc on her stomach.She said she was screaming in pain it was very painfull.The doc was also in shock,panicking that isn't she unconscious? and immediately gave her anesthesia.
I woke up in middle of a colonoscopy, it's not fun!
I thought u just take the pillow and some “relaxatives” and ya know the rest…
I thought you was squid game
I woke up during surgery and tried to move hand they operated on. The anesthesiologist got me back to sleep, but had to get close to over dose for my size to do so.  Been stressed about surgery since.
Jared 😂💀
Lol im 1000 comentary
1000
I woke up during a spine operation, apparently I asked the Nurse if I could have a cup of Tea and if their was any scones . . I was so doped up I thought I dreamt it but my doctor came in to see my I the morning and told me. . I actuall woke up again when being wheeled out of the operating room on the way to recovery.
Is that Mr 666 behind the Dr ? 😬
"Wale"
Ah yes, wale up.
Imagine running out of a hospital only to realize your intestines are tail out your butt like toilet paper on a shoe.
I feel bad for that guy but why tf in cracking up 😂
I woke up in the middle of a lithotripsy (kidney stone pulverizing) and first off, IT WAS DEAFENING LOUD and THEN I felt the pain. I yelled out, “IM AWAKE! IM AWAKE!!” And the anesthesiologist responded with, “Not for long!” And then I was back out!
Wale wait what
It does happen but insanely rare to wake up enough to remember (my mom would) OR nurse here.
Definitely trying to get you to double click on accident to like the video while trying to pause and read the short clip of text.
this story is as true as me having a girl
I remember when I was getting surgery and I woke up. I couldn't feel or move anything, and couldnt see anything since there was a sheet over my face. I literally, out of the blue, asked them "you done yet?" And a doctor responded with "almost" lol
When I was getting my wisdom teeth out, I wasn't completely under but was drugged and numbed up enough that I might as well been.  In the middle of my surgery, I don't remember doing this, but I looked my dentist square in the face and said "I wanna coffee" but I was all slurred because I was numb and had so much gauze and tools in my mouth.
I woke up during two surgeries, then after getting the block, I felt the doctor cut me open for a C-Section! They tell me I always have to tell the doctors I do this every time I have surgery now.
Thanks. As if pandemic wasn't enough. Just another thing to be worried about.  I guess I'll keep a Lulu Lemon bag handy.
Was that Jared Kushner? 😅
This happend to me but I woke up but I fell back to sleep 30 seconds later I was getting my tonsils and adenoids remover
i have the video
Its more likely to 4 times in lottery than waking up
You SUE the hospital, the surgeon and the anesthesiologist...🤨
I have woken up in middle of my nose surgery for enlarged bones and I just screamed "mumma mumma mumma" while flapping my hands and then they put me back to sleep. ig I was feeling suffocated due to not being able to breathe through nose when I woke up hence why I freaked out lmao. idk why I remember it so vividly. i sometimes feel so embarrassed thinking about it. not even shocked that I screamed mumma as I only cry when I am hurt in front of her.
Fun fact redheads take more anesthesia to put under
I actually woke up during a pacemaker and wire replacement it's didn't feel to good I felt everything then poof I went back to sleep
I read along time ago where a lady woke up to the surgeon saying man she has nice breasts and she sued him
At age 26 I woke up during a tonsillectomy. I was paralyzed so I couldn’t even signal that I was awake. I could hear the team talking, instruments clattering, and pulling and “scraping” at the back of my throat.
🧢
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates~ 🎈
If I were a surgeon and one of my patients woke up during surgery. I would punch them back to sleep.
ive woken up in the middle of my wisdom tooth surgery, i didnt feel anything but i can hear them scratch and drill into my mouth and hear their voices talking, i started wiggling my toes to signal them that i was awake cuz i was afraid of moving anything else that might startle them and hurt me. Once they saw my feet move i heard them say, "uh oh shes awake" and next thing i remember is waking up post operation
This happened to me— but I couldn’t move. I felt all the pain lol
So Jared Kushner woke up while part of his colon was being removed? lol
I woke up when I was having my tonsils removed I only saw the big bright light and then was knocked out
I have woken up during every surgery I've had. You talk some and they put you back under. When you wake up in recovery you will most likely be in a bad mood lol
Isn't the the (whats her name?) trumps husband? The bloodless looking fellow
A lawsuit if you feel it.
I woke during I was getting stitches in my eye
i’m getting surgery next week 😭
My brother and I were getting our wisdom teeth out on the same day. As he was in a waiting/recovery room he heard the med team go “we need more anesthesia, she’s waking up.”  I have a vague memory of seeing light from behind my closed eyelids and being really scared. I tried to say that, but I couldn’t bc they were literally conducting surgery in my mouth.  Thankfully that was the only problem with the operation and I no longer have too many teeth!
Ok but why you used Jared Kushner picture though? Are You trying say something 😂
What if you're under general anaesthesia and doctors think you're knocked out but you're actually conscious and hear everything but just can't move? That's my question
This happened to me before I ended up fighting for surgeons
It's messed with you long term, it's not just oh they woke up. It leaves you with an overwhelming distrust for going under the knife and for anyone with a chronic illness it is unavailable.
He said true story, so it must be true.
Did u know Harry styles woke up during knee surgery and just dealt with all that pain like this man it not human
I’ll tell you what happens-   *Player 3 joins the game*
Mans is off the shits 😭
My dad woke up during surgery, not sure what happened but he’s going on 43 and only has gut problems (unrelated to the surgery)
Jared kushner. Lmao
I love how he shows the vampire that is Jared Kushner.
I woke up a little when I was getting surgery on my gums they out a mask on me and said "just breathe in" didn't feel anything I just remember the nurse telling me to breathe in
My dumbass believing every word you say
My husband fights in his sleep. So when they were doing his hip surgery he started throwing punches halfway through the surgery. Luckily no one got hurt and they knew to give him more anesthesia for his other hip.
Owwww😯
I woke up during a cardiac ablation, felt the burning then was knocked out after hearing ,"she's awake"
I woke up in the middle of surgery this January. The pain was so bad that I woke up screaming and I saw blood and fluids and tools coming out of my body, and I heard a drill sound like when you go do the dentist. I saw bright lights and my face reflected in the big lamp they used. Then the doctor said something along the lines of "more anesthesia" and then I blacked out again and when I woke up, I was in a hospital bed and I couldn't move my legs. It was a traumatic experience, to say the least, I still have nightmares about it sometimes.  Edit: they never informed me about the anesthesia. When I asked why they were going to use less all of a sudden, when that wasn't what we agreed on, they told me to "shut up and let the experts decide". I honestly considered suing them several times, but I was too sick and tired and decided to give up. When I brought it up to other doctors they barely gave a shit too and downplayed it, so I guess it would've been just a waste of time and money.
Is that Jared kushiner??
this is one of my biggest fears D: I am somewhat resistant to anesthetisa, and need a lot of it to be numb --- I had to get my wisdom teeth removed and the doctor asked if I wanted to be knocked out I said NO... I would rather be AWAKE during the surgery and tell you if I still feel pain than be asleep but feel everything and can't tell you i'm in pain...
😳
Wtf he was carrying his intestines
Actually it happened to my friend, she was still on anesthesia but she woke up, she couldnt feel anything, but also she couldn't move, luckily a doctor noticed she was awake and put more anesthetic
Ya it’s because anesthesia is to busy playing games on their phones or shopping.
I woke up in my ankle surgery. Weirdest thing ever. You can hear it but you are still so numbed that you don't register what it is. Even joked about the surgery during it with the anaesthetists. As someone who was terrified of the idea of waking up, generally wasn't bad when it happened, just odd
O
He looks like the guy from squid game
where did he get the lululemon bag?
Only one single thing to say about this guy = idiot.
What about succinylcholine??(or other muscle paralyzers)
But he lived???
I hear they are good for lunch too
I woke up during surgery and they knocked my ass back out.
I have woken up in the middle of surgery it was ear surgery and I was 4 but it still hurt they just put me back to sleep and that was that
That happened on "My Feet Are Killing Me". They give you more anesthesia.
I woke up during my kidney stone removal procedure. I sat up and looked around. The doctor told me it's ok you can go back to sleep. And the next thing I remember is waking up in the post OP.
Probably a mans fault because you blame everything on men
How the heck did no one catch him????
my brain: you did this for what?
I have no idea why this was in my reccomended but I'm loving it
i laughed way to hard when he said lululemon bag
i woke up during surgery when the surgeons were doing a wound graft on me. i was 8. i just immediately started screaming and crying for help, and they just held me down and told me to go back to sleep. i remember seeing a giant hole taking up the majority of my right thigh. at that point i was already experiencing so much crazy stuff happening to my body for two years, so it wasn't the worst thing happening, lol
They woke my dad up in the middle of his surgery to see if his modular stimulator was set correctly... lets just say he threw a nurse
Then back b the builder took one look and said: "nope I can't fix that"

There was once a guy who stabbed himself with a knife while on drugs, and he woke up during surgery and started to stab himself with scalpels. It was in a military
Why wasn't the door locked i know it's gonna be a rare thing but still and how did so many people just let him leave crazy man
“What happens when you wake up in the middle of surgery?”  Google:  Bing: 🎵 ONE PUUUUUNNNNCH!!! 🎵 (OPM theme intensifies)
What does happen if I wale up during surgery?
I had three surgeries in my life time. When I told my physician who performed my first surgery he said no I imagined it. I then told him about the conversations he had with his nurses, the music he played during my surgery, and asked if one of nurses son won his baseball game she talked about during my surgery.  He was shocked. He said it has never happened to him. I told him I bet many patients wouldn't tell because they don't think their physician would believe them. I never told other physicians because the first one initially called me a liar.
I woke up during a tonsillectomy when I was 6yrs old. The surgery room had these awful green tiles, the light was blinding and I had several tools in my mouth. Apparently they were just using the electrocauter because it hurt and tasted like burnt flesh at the same time… Anyhow, as soon as I signaled that this was in fact hurting like a b*tch, they quickly knocked me out again. The good thing about modern anaesthesia is, that even if you wake up, you will not remember the event as being emotionally traumatizing - you're given substances to assure that.
My mom woke up in a middle of surgery, she didn’t run away but she got the surgeons attention and they put her back to sleep Surprising she stayed calm even tho her neck was cut open because she was going her thyroid removed
You die  The end
Yes I woke up once but not a surgery. It was a scope. The nurses all hold me down . Than I can feel everything and see a huge pipe like in my mouth and the doctor keep shoving it in. While the nurses hold me down. It hurt so bad I black out. And I woke up again seeing the huge pipe pulling out of my mouth and I can feel it too. Damn.
He had to jump up and get to that sale lol
I wale up late today
Imagine going to sleep knowing your in a surgery then having a good dream then waking up to see that a part of your chest is gone and you can see your ribs and half of your lung is being taken out
Judging by the comments waking up to surgery happens more than I thought
Ehhhhh i was eating 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I was kind of awake during my tummy tuck..they gave me twilight anesthesia. Told me to let them know if I felt pain.. There was PAINNNNNNNN..
I'd just wake up and grab a brush and put a little make-up.
I’ve done this 2 times and had to be held down while they gave me more sleepy time gas. Was not fun.
Wake up in surgery... then there will be a fine lawsuit and one jobless  Anesthesiologist
What if you never go to sleep and you feel the whole thing. It'll be your last child that's what
My younger brother wake up when they were removing his tonsils. The doctor had to hold him down to give him more anesthesia to finish the surgery. And the doctor was freaking out because of if and he cussed and my brother told me what he said.
Well at least i know to go get a Lululemon bag when i wake up.

I woke up in the middle of a colonosopy... SERIOUSLY. that's was the crappiest day ever. Have not had one since than
you wale up.
Was that Jared kushner? Lol wtf
I woke up in the middle of surgery. When they were removing my super impacted wisdom teeth. I woke up and the doctor told me to quiet down and hold still (more specifically to shut up) I remember it because I was so offended. The second they pulled the tooth out finally I went back under.
I woke up in the middle of ankle surgery. The surgeons said hey go back to sleep.
wow
Was the surgery done in the parking lot? How is it the doctors allowed him to rip himself from the machines he was connected to, get off the table, run around the hospital with his butt exposed and bleeding. Then ran out the front door of a public hospital, and not one person tried to stop him. Where was security? And I’m guessing when he was found no one called 911 because he returned with his intestines in a shopping bag?? So, an ambulance didn’t bring him back? He just walked back with his guts in a bag. I’m confused 🤔
god people are saying that if u wake up in surgery just go back to sleep.....HOW ON MOTHER NAUTURE EARTH DO U JUST SAY OH I NEED TO SLEEP AGAN AND THEN U GO TO SLEEP LIKE HOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!?!!!?!!?!!!?!?!!?!?!?!!?!?!?!?!?!?!!?!?!?!?!
I woke up in the middle of getting my wisdom teeth removed and I don't remember feeling anything, but lifting my head slightly and seeing blurry objects in the room. Heard the doctor say to give him more or something along those lines and I was right back out.
My friend's dad woke up from having his appendix out, he proceeded to have an heart attack as they give you a muscle relaxant, so was not  able to alert them that he was aware of what they were doing 😱 so that young man couldn't have got up a run anywhere.
That is crazy
😬😲😳😱
Ummm, so the doctor didn't answer the question at all.
I have a memory of the middle of my operation. I genuinely can't remember if it was simply before tho
Just look up Donna Penner
They push ur head down
I woke up in a surgery after 8 hours of surgery from an accident. I made them realize I was awake. They finished up. Then hurried up and got me off the ventilator. When they removed I screamed so loud you could here it in the waiting room.
Jared kushner🤢you really don't know who that entity do you and your in love with it huh doc?
Don't they also give meds to paralyse you during surgery?
Apparently I woke up in the middle of surgery when I was little and started screaming. They up'd my dosage and I fell back asleep but I was not happy when I got out of the operating room. The anesthetic actually has a high chance of making you forget what happened in the surgery. So if you wake up in the middle of surgery during today's medicine you're likely to not remember anything.
I woke up during a  caesarean - I was fully aware but could  not move - I was told it was because a drug causing paralysis is used as well as anesthesia to prevent movement so I very much doubt this could happen - please explain
I like how Anthon knew he said wake even tho the commenter said wale up
Once i had to do a lungs test and had to be put to sleep. Unexpectedly,  i woke up in the middle of the process and i saw horrible things happening to my body.  I tried to fight back( Coz my brain tricked me into danger.exe ) but was put back to sleep not long after that
I woke during a heart catheterization.  They put back out quickly.
When i was 13 I had to have some of my small intestines removed due to skin growing around them causing a blockage i remember waking up in the middle of surgery yelling for my real dad but he wasnt there, i was in foster care at the time too!
With the most recent paralytics,  and IV pumps that warn the CRNA  if the patient is waking up.  It would be very rare for something like that to happen today.
I woke up during a abscess removal surgery  The doc was like it's a dream wake up And put me to sleep  When I woke up dude was sitting there and told me told u to wake up now u dead and we in hospital hell  I was already fucked in the head with all the gas and dude confused the shit outa me well his been my doc since I was 10 now I'm 42 lol
You'll problem freak out and pass out anyway
Happened to me. Surgeon didn't believe me until I told them what they said during surgery. Never having surgery again. No apology or questions about how I felt and what I needed to deal with it. Just shrugs and a "it happens sometimes".
Who agrees he looks like gi hun from squid game
I heard it is possible, though you don't really awake, cause you're not really sleeping. You may just be aware of what's happening, but don't feel anything. Not sure, I may be just saying crazy thing. :))
my mom woke up during surgery (i don’t know what it was) but the doctor punched her in the chest and she went back to sleep, she woke up afterwards and could barely breathe and had a huge knot and bruise on her chest
If you wake up they put you back to sleep. I woke up twice during my wrist fracture surgery, I just looked to the anesthesiologist and she gave me some more sedative and I went back to sleep
I woke up at the end of my Gastric Sleeve surgery when my surgeon was finishing my last stitches. Woke up and screamed “my stomach! My stomach! Pain!”  I was terrified and my surgeon was as well! 😂  They put me back to sleep… and my doctor and I had a a hilarious talk when I did wake up in the recovery room. He said I screamed so loud I scared everyone in the room but especially the anesthesiologist and he kept coming to see me during the day every hour or so just to make sure I was ok lol. Sweetest man ever.
My cousin woke up during shoulder surgery. He said as the doctor started pulling on the tendons to the shoulder, he sat up and started screaming. He said it took 2 nurses to hold him down while the hurried to get gas mask back on him. He still remembers it clearly.  I woke up briefly during a surgery, I remembered their conversations. Then I heard doctor say I think he is waking up, that was last i remember.  It happens more than hospitals will admit to.
I've woke up every single time
To anyone who reads this: Maybe you're here for getting rid of your anxiety and stresses. I know you will find the peace as soon as possible and you will make your dreams and goals come true🌱fight for it👊🏽don't underestimate yourself❤You will rock it💫just keep going❤️❤️
i woke up during my tonsillectomy, i wasnt aware that smoking weed before surgery effected the anesthesia and they never asked if i smoked before. i woke up, i heard “oh shit” and then went back to sleep 🤣
I woke up during both of my surgeries. I was 4 for the first one and 6 for the other
This short gives anxiety to my intestines for some reason
Fuckkkkkk you that's shit had me traumatized for a moment
How did he survive if the intestines are out the body?. Did he lose much blood? Why he ran away? What! (Okay rewatched it and I get it, it's fine)
Do plastic surgeons get to see the patients naked?
They jake Paul your ass and get back to cuttin ✂️
I woke up during spinal surgery and tried to push myself off the table only to hear the surgeon tell the anesthesiologist, “put her under NOW!”
It is still a possibility for a patient to wake up during surgery that they could not get out of the room as the Anastasia would have taken over their bodies stopping them from moving. A special doctor monitors the patients medical status so the surgery can be paused and will not continue until another dose of Anastasia was applied
Your enemies with Dr Brown how about you both fight one day instead
one of the biggest fear of anaesthesiologist
please add CC to your videos !!
Nahhh this video reminded me of Rodd Reiss titan from attack on Titan
This is cap. With an operation like that you are fully a sleep. Yes you can wake up but you won't be able to move.
I haven't had that problem under general, at least that I remember anyway. I tell them they can't give me moderate/twilight sedation though. I get confused and combative and attempt to escape because I get fight or flight going on and don't have the cognizance to understand what's happening. But I remember the whole thing later. Has happened twice D: Btw, shout out to nurses. Last time that happened during an EGD, the only person that I remember talking nicely to me when I freaked out was the voice of the nurse. She got me to calm down. The other clinical folks present were raising their voices at me which made me freak out more.
I briefly woke up during a screw removal from my foot - they knocked me back out so fast but I heard them say she woke up
Everytime time i hear Lulu lemon i am going to think abt bag with intestine
The FitnessGram™ Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, start..
My grandmother woke up during leg surgery
ive done this before but it wasnt that much of a deal, I woke up when they were fixing my broken forearm so all they did was just give me more anesthesia
Why the hell did you show Jared Kushner.
I woke up on an operating table with 4 ppl around me, pulling something out of my belly button, but ive never had surgery.
My mom was talking and moving in her operation
I woke up to the nurses and doctor talking about another doctor and a nurse having an affair.  Neither the wife or husband knew.  Doctor told me no way did I wake up. So I proceed to tell him all I heard.  He said shhhh she’s ( the wife) is your nurse.  Awkward
Why there is picture of Jared kushner in the background? 😁😁😂. As a young man
That guy must have suffered problem from that later
I thought this was going to a pun about half assing things.
The mother of a friend of mine had a C-section without anesthesia, they applied the anesthesia too early and she ended up feeling all the pain
That's why they tie you down dude
I woke up in middle of surgery but I wasn't able to move it felt like sleep paralysis tho. Man everything seemed to be double. Whew~ that was quite a experience (but I wanna know why I was not able to move ? It was a surgery for multiple Leg and hand fracture )
"wale up"
Woke up during gallbladder surgery too! Its hell- hurt like murder! They scrambled  to put me back to sleep.  They knew ai knew. Now I have to tell when I have surgeries that my body super processes anesthesia  quickly. Woke up during appendectomy  too.
Would ppl be able to remember what was going on? Usually ppl doesn't understand anything when waking up from anaesthesia ( sorry for my bad English) just curious 🤔
When your on anesthesia you can feel the sensation but not the pain like when you cut your skin while on anesthesia it feels like cutting  soft leather. You can feel the coldness of thr scissors.  So if you wake up in a surgery while they are removing something intetnal. You can feel they are removing something no pain but very unpleasant. Like something is missing from ur body and as u feel it more you can havr trouble in breathing for ecample.   Lol. This is just What I think. Because the scissors on skin along with sewing of skin I ecperienced that. The second paragraph is full of something I just thought it would be like. But the feeling of troubled breathing is true thougg.
It happened to me about 13 yrs ago, it was terrifying and so painful. The anesthesiologist didn't give me enough of something and I "woke up" with the initial incision (mind numbingly painful!), but was immediately put back under. Then while they were in the middle of finishing up on me n stitching me up it happened again. I couldn't move at all and my eyes were taped shut, I'm hugely claustrophobic n I was in sheer panic and I kept fighting internally to be able to move until finally I could move enough that I actually extubated myself right when they were bandaging me up at the end and I tried to get off the table. Even tho I relayed to them the things I heard them saying while I was supposed to be under, they refused to admit to me that it had happened at all. I'm terrified to have surgery again even tho I'm in dire need of 2 surgeries right now, both of which my Drs say I can't put off any longer, but I can't help being sooo scared.
Was the young man Jared Kushner? that’s who it looked like to me.
One of my best friends was having surgery on her wrist, nothing too risky. She woke up mid-surgery, looked at her open wrist, looked at the stunned faces of the doctors, said "oh shit", then passed out because of the shock 😂 She then woke up after the surgery was done.
If you told me that was a Florida man, I would've 100% believed you
There is a movie in which the dude under anesthesia feels everything but cant wake up.
Looks like Kushner 😂
My dad woke up during a surgery on his shoulder a few years ago after coming back from Afganistan. It was like halfway through the operation and he woke up and started trying to move and he said like 3 different nurses jumped on him to keep him from moving
My dad had is gallbladder removed when he was a kid.     He told me that he saw his heart and intestines wrapped in a baby blanket😂
I have a friend of mine who actually woke up in the middle of a surgery
As a child I woke up in the middle of a surgery. I only can remember doctors with bloody hands and that huge operation lamp. Everyone was suddenly in a rush and then I think I slept again
I love it’s a lulu lemon bag🤣
I woke up during my wisdom teeth removal this July. I could hear everything and feel pressure in my mouth and the teeth coming out but luckily no pain cause of the numbing agents. I kept my eyes closed cause I didn’t want to freak the doctor and nurses out 😂
I woke up from having all 4 very impacted wisdom teeth removed. Nope didn't put me back under was strapped down with something holding my mouth open. Ended up inpatient because he broke my jaw.
You like like the fella guy in squid game...
Why do u look like Dr. Alex Park from the Good Doctor?
Jared Kushner??? I guess you turn into a very plain looking man like him.
How was he still alive 💀?  Why didn't they get him!!!???
Me: wakes up and flips my pillow  Everyone else performing heart surgery on me:
He forgot there was a discount that day
just imagine a rich white mother walking by him and reaching out her hand like “here honey, looks like you need this.”
No doctor was athletic enough?
Reading these comments..... I hope I never have to have surgery 😳😳😳
My dad woke up during a knee replacement. He didn’t feel anything of course. He just waved his arms around to let them know he was awake. The anesthesiologist ran over and shot him up with something and knocked him right back out.
My grandma told me that she woke up during a surgery and she could hear everything. Doctors were taking about soccer and what are the odds for the next game.
I can’t imagine what kind of pain that guy was in…
I woke up towards the end of a tooth removal when I was little and cried my eyes out asking where my mum had gone before they stuck a great but mask on my face and forced me to sleep 😃
Please try AQ
Bruh
What happens if you WALE up
I woke up in the middle of surgery... They were removing my gallbladder... They quickly held me down and re-gassed me 0.0 it was so painful
I woke up during the middle of my wisdom tooth removal... All I remember is somebody saying "she's waking up" and the surgeon immediately stopped so they could knock me out again. That's literally all I remember from the entire process, and there was no pain that I was really aware of, so it could've been worse 😂
Who's picture did they use?
It says wale up
I looked super quick at the picture of the guy and thought it was a weird looking Shawn Mendes like 🎵 “You watch me bleed until I can’t breath”
I locked up from the pain when I woke up during a procedure. My chest got tight and I couldn’t breathe. I started to gasp and beg for them to stop. “Please. It hurts. Please.” I remember the doctor saying “sh!t, sh!t, sh!t, sh!t” and frantically pointing at something next to the anesthetist. The anesthetist slowly reached over and touched something, said “there we go”, and I was unconscious again. When I woke up, several hours after I was supposed to, I asked the doctor if everything was ok and how it went. Cool as a cucumber he said “Everything went fine. Nothing concerning that I could see. Take it easy for a few days and you’ll be alright. Wait one second and the nurse will be in with the details for your follow up.” And we never talked about it again.   Everything WAS alright though because he actually found and fixed the bleed and just didn’t tell me. I woke up while he was burning the rip shut. I was bleeding internally before the procedure, fluid pooling in my lower abdominal cavity could be seen by CT and ultrasound and they didn’t know where it was coming from. He must have thought he cut me on accident or something but I saw it on the monitor when I woke up during the procedure. It was there before he moved his tools to the spot. He had just finished burning the tear shut before he realized I was awake.
I've woken up during a gyno op, the anesthetist was beside me chatting to the nurse. I started screaming and the doctor looked at the  anesthetist and said put her back to f$#king sleep. Then I next woke up when it was over.
He put joke after all
I am...you know just imagining it...is just I can't I just can't say it's...oh God...
I woke up in a surgery before but I couldn't open my eyes no matter how hard I tried so I was like "whatever" and went back to sleep.
Why would you jump off the table
Hits different when a doctor jokes because i just somehow assume everything say is true xD
🗣️Boi he​ wake​    HUH?!😥 Him:                💀
You look like a killer in a Korean drama  call “ flower of evil “
Wtf me scared af 😱
😨😱🥴☠
My husband woke up halfway through his hernia surgery because the anesthesiologist was too busy worrying about his date later that day and let his line go dry. and then because he woke up in the middle of surgery his lung collapsed because they had a tube down his throat. And he almost died liter his mom and I were walking by the surgery room right when it happened and he was spitting blood everywhere. Yes he is fine now and yes the anesthesiologist lost his job and the hospital got sued. But I'm so glad hes still around❤ it was definitely one of the scariest moments ever.
Two years ago, I needed to do a surgery, but i suddently woke up in the middle of the sugery. Happly, it wasn't that bad beacouse i didn't felt anything and u went back to sleep in a few seconds
Just punch me in the face and put me back to sleep, make sure to hit the chin nice and clean to make sure my brain rattled and I’m out cold
I would pass out
The doctor says "oh, shit!  He's awake!" and you get more anesthesia...
I have snippets of memories of all my surgeries. Endometriosis, removal of appendix and gallbladder, shoulder repair, and wisdom teeth (if that counts). I remember snippets of conversations the staff were having before being given another dose to go back. I think I always try to talk. My system seems to burn through meds extremely quickly. I've been told to bring this up if I ever need surgery in the future, but it has yet to help. Lol. I can't describe just how glad I am that I don't remember any pain though, because the horror stories you hear are just awful.
This should be called dumbest patients ever.
I woke up in suguary and was sick on staff
You wake up and the first thing you hear “What you think happens if we cut this shit”
Wait how was ha still alive
If i wake up during a surgery I'll say "ayo, i think i need more anesthesia" then go back to sleep
Waking up...well would be very strange.... but wale....whut? I read the lines....and was...what?
Hope he is well and didn't get infection 😅
This doesn't make me like the idea of surgery at all
Isn't that jared kushner in the photo? 😂
That is both scary and cool.....
What happens? Alot of cussing.%$#!*&^
That doesn't answer the question. That's what a single person did.
I've woken up!!! It was terrifying realizing I was 100% paralyzed and the cool part was that I repeated every insult the nurses said to me!! Mwahahahahahahahahaha
Is he ok?
I can't believe he run off might be confused but that is the stupidest thing I've ever heard
This doesn’t sound right.
That is so unsettling......
That’s so weird … seeing your internal organs fall out of your and then bringing it back???
These shorts are so entertaining. who agrees?🦕
Why did he run out though
I woke up during a surgery to remove my appendix it almost felt like I was dreaming the doctors noticed looks concerned for like 2 seconds and then it's black again. Lol
Not true bc they strap you down in c section. I did however feel them cutting me open and told them to stop. They asked me what I felt as soon as I explained it they put me under fully.
Oh Dr. Y, once again enlightened me and I can’t unsee… 🤪
Once my sister woke up during her gallbladder surgery and started to shout, they had to give more anesthesia, same with my brothers tonsil surgery he started to thrash around trying to run, then same with my father during his nose surgery.
Imagine waling up :'(
I woke up during my second eardrum tube surgery! It was weird.
So if I wake up I jump out of bed?
At least , he was bowel prepped, otherwise its a stinky mess.
what happer if u farted in a sugery
Sad face
I woke up before but uhm I didn't feel pain and i ended up falling back asleep because my body was to weak and I was doing oral surgery
I’ve woken up; I remember starting to wake up, groaning in pain, starting to squirm because it hurt and I heard ‘shit! shit! She’s waking up! Get her back under, NOW!’ And within seconds I went back down. Talked to them after, they denied it until I described word for word what they said, and they were like ‘oopsie sorry!’
Robber: HEY GIMME THAT BAG!!! Robber: “Looks in bag” AHHHHHHHHHHHH
Why specifically loo loo lemon bag dunno
I woke up and could feel everything my cardiologist was doing. Cutting, pulling putting in the pacemaker,  sewing me back up. I couldn't speak to let them know I WAS AWAKE.  That was in 2001, so in 2009 they made sure I was asleep that time.
I woke up during surgery and they taped my eyes shut🤣
This was a joke
Not buying this story, but it's entertaining!
This happened to me when I was 11. Luckily, they noticed pretty quickly so I didn't have much time to comprehend what was happening before I was back out... but it created a tremendous fear in me and in surgeries and procedures that require anesthetic, local or general, since...I really make a big deal about making sure I am well sedated/numbed and anxiety goes to 11/10
My ex had a reaction from morphine after being in a coma. He woke up and ripped at his stitches in abdomen and his organs were coming out. Yadda yadda he was sorted out and okay lol
"wake" not wale
Partly woke up during my Circumcision the immedatally noticed and i was out cold again
Lilly grace 👀👀👀
I have very high resistance to anesthesia, so they had to give me 3 injections instead of 1 when removing a mole from my back 🙂👍
There have been cases where the anesthesia wears off early while the person was still being operated on. They couldn't move, but felt every thing that was done to him
"Go the f**k back to sleep" then just punch then ssquare in the face.
Man imagine working at a store and a guy comes in with his intestines hanging and he asks for a bag
Hey to all my anaesthetic resistant people out there!!! Are we super humans?
I just got my wisdom teeth removed last week and woke up during it, I’m pretty sure it’s not uncommon during wisdom teeth removal because you’re under twilight I think it’s called which isn’t the same as truly being put to sleep. I woke up and remember I could feel them crushing my teeth, no pain just the feeling of it and noise, and not being able to open my eyes and grunting. Managed to Open my eyes for like 5 seconds maybe and I remember seeing like a metal plier looking thing and then the doctor saying “we’re almost done bud don’t worry” and then fell back asleep. Nice doctor
Ha I was in the recovery theatre just after my augmentation.  Woke up started taking the wires and pipes out of me, and told the nurse I was just going outside for a little cigarette. She told me to sit back down as I would do no such thing, she put the paper nightie back over me, I lay back down and woke a few hours later on my ward
He left out the hospital probably naked in the street with half his organ open in front of everyone /:
I woke up during a surgery once. But all i remember is that huuge light above me and a fee Medical staff around me. They gave me anesthesia again and knocked me out
Don't understand the need of making up a shitty story just to get views.
The doctors sing you a lullaby..
Surgery that lives by falling down the steps of my basement
I was having an embolization done and I woke up halfway through the procedure can hear everything and see everything even started crying because I could feel things I remember the anesthesiologist looked down at me and said honey are you awake can you feel this can you hear me I nodded my head and he gave me more sedation to put me out I’ll never forget that again that was the worst experience I’ve had
I've woken up during breast augmentation. I said I feel a sharp scrapping pain in my chest.
I had my surgery 7 years ago (removal of my ovarian cyst) , and I also woke up in the middle, Fuck i hate it, i shouted in a panic way saying "I'm gonna die!" 3 times , And the staff nurses immediately restrained me.  And eventually I knocked out again.  That was hella embarassing 🥺😭  Till these day, I never talked about it to anyone. I wonder what the medical staffs were thinking at that time.🤣🤣🤣 What the f
It's haunted me before my c.Section. now I want a baby but too scared of giving a birth 😟
Shit m sick hearing this
I woke up during a bone marrow sample test for blood cancer and saw a huge needle which was about to be pricked somewhere on my back. I ran out of the ot and rushed to my bed 😂.  Dw the bone marrow test was only for money. I didn't have any cancer symptoms except i vomitted blood very often and that was due to problem in my appendix.
Stupid anyone believing this stupidness is just as moronic .
He said wale up not wake up
I woke up during my wisdom teeth removal surgery they had me on light anesthesia I’m not to for sure… but I remember the pain and about to cry  and the dentist asking how I was doing and then he said something along the lines of give her some more… so that was fun…  I find it really interesting.
"uh yeah. I took a short break. Just needed to get some air"
I hope that you can understand when I say BS
Reading these comments and feeling comfort in the fact it’s more common than most would thing and that I’m not the only one who remembers waking up😂
I've had a 13 hour three stage spinal surgery and was deliberately woken up during it. It's called a wake-up-test. You don't remember it...
When I was 16, I woke up during surgery. I was choking on my own blood. Doctor explained what happened and ask me if I was ready to go back under. I nodded and complied. I can’t imagine what would have happened if I had freaked out and refused.
I woke up when they were operating on my hand & I just casually looked over * Shrugs and talks to the one of the surgeons * Oh your still working on my hand 🤚🏻 Scared her so I pretended I was day dreaming 🛌 👌🏻
This makes me want to unsubscribe. I am getting ankle surgery in February and I’m really nervous about it. I was believing this and worried, if I didn’t pause the video and read that purple caption I would’ve been really unsettled, why?  It’s not funny.
I woke up in the middle of a retinal reattachment surgery. Omg the pain! I screamed!! I saw blood and roses. That's how I described it anyways.
My grandpa woke up during open heart surgery and had PTSD from it but the doctors just tried to tell him it didnt happen and he was dreaming so they wouldn't get sued.   He didn't have the money to try and sue them anyway.   But it really messed him up
When I was getting a lingual frenectomy (tongue surgery) and wisdom teeth removal I woke up. The night before I watched a documentary on dismemberment and when I woke up and saw scissors in front of my face I freaked out. Kicked the anesthesiologist hard. He was still limping when I was taken to the recovery room. I also clawed at the surgeon but my hands were restrained before I did any damage. But imagine a 5'4 girl with clamps in her mouth attacking everyone while wearing pastel pink and blue socks with owls on them.
i never wanna fucking wake up during a serious surgery on my body if I do I fucking hope they knock my ass out quickly please fucking god
But there was one guy who was awake but was paralyzed he could see and feel what they where doing to him but just couldn't see anything
It happened to me. I thought🤔 …I died! Now my ectoplasm will exude from the body my body and I will see the 💡 or the 👿.  Instead pain 😱
Back in the days, people would have a operations widely awake, and surgeons wouldn't be rated from how good the surgery is, but how fast the surgery was, because the faster surgery was,the less pain patient would get.
All the moms who have had awake c sections... "👁👁, yeah and?" 🤣
Cool.  😒
You see, this is why I find knocking patiants with your hands is much more efficient.
Where the comments                                                                                                                                                 [pin this]
Getting a discogram....I swear I woke up with what felt like a nail being hammered through my ankle..it was maybe 2 seconds max. I seen them push white liquid in my hand where the iv was. Back to half sleep I went. Had to be in a twilight sleep because of the test.
wake*
🤔🤨🤢🤮
Ugh. what does the bit at the end say? I am never quick enough to pause the video. -_-
I woke up 3 times during my surgery.  Very groggy tho. I remember my back was hurting from lying on the operation table and I asked to be moved. On the third time, I remember the surgeon complaining to the anesthesiologist lmao.
I woke up in the middle of my surgery … i still have nightmares about that
He survived?
I remember when I woke up during surgery. I woke up and kinda sat up but the doctors just pushed me back down and I went back to sleep. Don't know if that actually happened though. Nobody told me I just remember.
My doctor actually told me that I briefly woke up during my appendectomy. He told me that we were casually talking back and forth to each other like the surgery was nothing, then eventually I went back to sleep.  They didn't knock me back tho.
Wasn’t there a report of someone who woke up during surgery who was in a paralysis state ( pretty much meaning they feel everything but can’t move, talk etc ) so they went through their whole surgery feeling every little incision the surgeons make
Oh 🙌 well let me tell you...  👩🏻‍🦰Redheads actually do not absorb anesthesia as efficiently as the average person.  So, As a natural redhead , this actually happened to me during my first surgery under General anesthesia , when I was 8. 👩🏻‍🦰  I woke up in the middle and couldn't move or talk... *but I could scream*   .... and so I did. Lol they ended up having to bring my mom into the room while they put me back to sleep.   Plus novacaine shots at the dentist doesn't work on me for this reason as well... 😬
It's wake up not wale up
I woke up during surgery. Look around and seen my arm muscle and tendons aand skin pulled to the side
I woke up during cataract surgery. Ask the doctor what was going on? All I saw was red, and I do remember. They had to knock me down way down when they did the other eye. They didn't
I woke up. During a surgery and I didn’t really know what was going on I kinda just saw everyone and went back to sleep
I woke up during a breast reduction.  Flopped my boobs back and forth. I thought the doctor was copping a feel! Turns out he was deciding where to make the cut(s).  Later I woke up when they were chatting about me. Could hear the respirator. I started to wiggle my index finger! Not nearly as traumatic as it sounds though. Kind of funny. Great results.  However,  I always let them know about this.  The next time, I needed a general, dreamed about my cat ;)
Well did he live?
He really said nope
I woke up during surgery and apparently tried to beat up my drs. Ooopppss should have believed me when i told them that I am not sensitive to opioids or anesthesia.....
What happens if pt. Can feel the entire operation and Dr does not know it. Has happened.
Doctors of YouTube... I'm gonna need a whole video on this story plz.
Fun story: When I was 14 I woke up during my tonsil removal surgery. I opened my eyes and freaked out a little and pulled out my IV. Nurse just said “she’s up” and then I was back out cold. That’s how we learned I’m resistant to anaesthesia, both local and general. For local, I have to have 2-3x the normal amount or I’ll feel everything again in roughly 3-5 minutes whereas I shouldn’t feel anything for about an hour or more. Fun times.
Well I might as well wear good shoes So I run faster
….today in YouTube shorts….Trauma…
How that guy didnt died
Is that young man dr ricky brown?
My mom woke up during one of her surgeries. She said she looked at them and the were below her and she asked them why they were below her. (She thought they were hanging out on the floor). They told her they were almost done with her surgery, she said okay and went back to sleep. 😂
Aperently my uncle did that and he was confused as heck
I once woke up in the middle of leg surgery. Heard voices of saw machine and hammer ignored them and instantly went back to sleep doctors didn't notice I was awake.
didnt they ask what happens if you wale up?
My reaction to this video  😯🥴😨
I woke up in middle of my  circumcision and i just went back to sleep.. Nothing bad happened
What the hell if I woke up middle of surgery I won't like just like run out of the emergency room I mean I'll probably just stay there
I would suggest making the joke more clear rather than putting the asterisk up for 3 seconds at the end. There’s a lot of 12 year olds that can’t read that fast and took the story to heart I bet…
That guy looked like Jared Kushner.
That’s really funny when I was 16 I had sinus surgery woke up in the middle of surgery the doctor looked at me and was like oh shit don’t move and I was just like what is going on next thing you know I wake up in the elevator the nurse looks at me and says there is no way in hell that you should be awake right now
Imagine how uncomfortable he felt looking at his intestines in a bag
Whale up🤣
I woke up with a tube down my throat. Worst feeling ever.
I’ll tell y’all what happens. You scare the absolute FUCK out of some poor med student by twitching your eyes up to them in the middle of a surgery.   Honestly, unless they gave you not enough numbing medication it’s not that bad.    ….unless they give you too much of something.
I woke up during open heart surgery at 11 years old... I have ptsd because of it. (I'm now 21 ) Shits scary asf
No one can wale up during surgery 🤣🤣🤣😂😂 they can only wake up and it's so rare to wake up while surgery
Disgusting
Why is he showing a photo of trumps son In law
I woke up during GI surgery to hear everyone in the room discussing the NBA playoffs. I tried to chime in but could only make gurgling noises because I was intubated. The room went  silent and I was out like a light in about 2  seconds. I asked the surgeon about it in post op and he just laughed and changed the subject.
Based on the comments here, everyone wakes up during surgery and is able to remember it while under anesthesia.. yeah I'm calling BS
In my case it's time to wake up but I didn't so the nurse softly tap my cheeks few times to wake me up😴
Now I'M not going to sleep
Omg 🤣
I woke up during my wisdom teeth removal. All the doctors seemed extremely surprised, I don't remember too much, but I know I fell back asleep. I just remember remember the look of shock on their faces
I have been operated once And people think I'm making things up  Like no one believes/believed me But I woke up during my operation but the nurse guy put my head down and moved his hands over me eyes so they could close and I slept again...
No I won't wake up I wAlE up
I once woke up in the middle of a lung surgery. I remember listening the surgeons talking, and the pressure from the instruments and what not manipulating my lung tissues.  Luckily, I felt no pain. I could only see a green sheet blocking the view of my chest... and I couldn't move anything but my eyelids. The sensation of the ventilator doing the job for me was also weird.  The anesthesiologist eventually noticed I was awake and gave me more medication and I lost consciousness again. I was five years old.
This story 😳 I woke up in the middle of cataract surgery. I wasn't able to form words, so I made zombie sounds 🧟‍♀️
Yes that happened to my mama thank god she fine
Is he alive now
•_•
luckily we don’t have to worry about that because now they can see if we feel it or not and stuff like that and see if people are about to wake ip
My Dad woke up during carpal tunnel surgery. He remembers pushing his arms up at the doctor and the nurse freaking out cause he was squirting blood everywhere. They gave him more sleepy meds and finished and pretended like it didn't happen.
Wow
All I'm learning from this comment section is that we're not suing enough doctors, and it needs to be easier to do so.  "But then they'll go on strike and-!"  And if the government doesn't fix it (two biggest problems afaic are funding and how expensive and stressful medical school is. Fix that, fix the worst of the issues related to malpractice), shit will go downhill so fast we'll have heads on spikes in no time. Or, if the government has a lick of sense, they'll learn their lesson ASAP and at *least* put in a stopgap measure. Like I said, it's that or the guillotine. I don't know why we stopped beheading monarchs and crooked politicians (and judges, cops, etc.). Like, I know why they stopped _public_ executions, but seriously. Bring back actual repercussions for the people in power. And stop fucking letting narcissists join the medical field!
I woke up once, asked how the surgery was going and they put me back to sleep
No Anthony, he didn't wake up. He wale up.
This happened to me, i was in the middle of my hand cyst surgery. I woke up and immediately looked to my right hand then I tried to move my hand (obviously I can't) then the surgeon put a mask on me to sleep again. But.... At least I got a glimpse of it 😌
My dad woke up during eye surgery and came home with a bloody black and red eyeball, but he was actually fine afterwards and can still see
If that was me i would say "nice"
Ok, but what happens? What would Dr's do in that situation?
If you wake up in the middle of a surgery you should get large compensation for someone not doing their job right.
That doesnt answer the question
Oh god why would you run away Just his asshole flying everywhere fuck😂😩
Woke up when I was having my tonsils and adenoids removed when I was a kid. They just simply looked at me rested my head back down and said sleep and then I went back to sleep.
Ah yes wale up
How was he even able to jump off a table if he was just asleep-
Wtf was that allowed? FFS
Why you delete video about hair in the face ???
if i ever have a surgery i want to be awake for some reason idk if that is weird or not though
Wale up
Just had two fingers partially amputated and I woke up as the guy was sewing me up and they had me fully strapped Down and I had a panic attack from the pain and the fact I had no idea what was going on and they just paralyzed my arm by injecting some kinda numbing stuff into my nerve in my shoulder and told me to chill the fuck out
💀🥵🥵🥵
Has anybody else seen that one episode in New Amsterdam where they had the huge snow storm and that one guy woke up in his surgery? New phobia unlocked lol
I thought waking up in the middle of surgery was normal?
*wakes up* Doc, your clearly not a professional lemme show how to do that
The guy in the picture is Jared Kushner 🤔 😂😂😂
My friends brother woke up during heart surgery, shot up and asked is it done yet
Is that young man Jared kushner 😂
What if you wake up and can't move or say anything you just sit there in the nightmarish pain as they cut your body open
Alright, I'm gonna tell a story that my grandma and father told me. Here we go. My grandmother woke up during her hand surgery in her mid 50's. She has always had epilepsy problems since a car accident that happened a few decades before. She was cooking pasta for my father, when she had an epilepsy attack and fainted. Her hand went inside the boiling pot full of pasta and she had to have the tip of her fingers cut off and they needed to take some skin from her thigh to transfer it to her fingers. During the surgery, she regained consciousness and was half-awake. Apparently she could feel the pain but was only able to faintly groan. That's pretty much what I've been told.
Holy shit has everyone woken up from a surgery!?! Literally all the comments
I feel like I should get some legal thing in order where if I’m ever in a panic like this I give full authorization to taser me immediately because I literally do not want to have my intestines outside if my body. Or maybe have physical restraints placed on me so I can’t get anywhere if I do try to run.
I woke up in a middle of a colonoscopy .   Got that anesthesia guys name so I never use him again!
when my mother gave birth to my sister, when she was sewing her belly, she ran out of anesthetic, so she was sewing to live 4 stitches 😲😘
:)))
Cant u just put him too sleep if he wakes up like punch head?
One of my friends parents woke up and then gave her an injection and she went back to sleep
Well as someone who's been under anaesthesia, this make sense when you know that anaesthesia doesn't wear off immediately. You don't just snap back awake. They might have an IV so they can just put some more in if they see early signs of waking up. Additionally, when I was under anaesthesia, it was probably the closest thing to death I've ever felt. Very heavy sleep.
Knock yourself out if you wake up it's easy
Why are there so many PARAGRAPHS EVERYWHERE??
The anesthesia and anesthesiologist get sued that’s what
Now he has a semicolon ;
One of my doctors recently told me that when she was younger she had a brain tumor and it had to be removed that week or she would die. She told me that all she remembers is that during the surgery she woke up feeling super cold and she remembers she kept saying "it's so cold". Later, the OR nurse confirmed she had woken up and kept saying it was so cold. Makes me wonder if they were operating on a part of her brain that had to do with tempeture regulation or if when it's exposed to air something happens. But that's just a theory. Idk a lot about the human body lol.
Even if you wake up, you will be put back to sleep and forget any pain you might have felt
Too easy
I have done similar but was unable to run away. I woke up told them it hurt and they tried to tell me I was dreaming so I got my hand loose and started to swing at them then they knocked me out with drugs. As they were opening me up for a hernia repair. Scary..no lulu lemon bag though
Two word: HOLY SHIT
Who is the person in the image he used here?
i woke up while i was sleeping
So, wake up in the middle of surgery is ok (?) I mean based on that man who still fine walk out from hospital
It actually happens quite a lot. Most of the time, the patient doesn’t even remember. We just adjust the anesthesia and they are back out. Fortunately, they don’t typically wake up panicked or in pain because of the sheer amount of drugs coursing through their systems, they are mostly confused and think they are dreaming.
My mom was having a C-section and woke up in the middle off it and the doctors realized pretty quickly and put her back to sleep
I have had many surgeries and I'm so sorry hearing all these people in the comments saying when they woke up the during surgery because that is one of my biggest nightmares
I woke up during my tonsillectomy.... Yeah. It's as horrifying as it sounds, and will haunt me too my grave. I was somehow able to trick myself out into calming down long enough for them to finish and get there equipment out of my mouth and throat but I was crying the whole time
I wake up during surgery. I woke up during cataract surgery.
Is no one talking about how the comment says wale( not  tryna be mean)
You feel a pain, root around for your stuffy and feel a poke in your arm see the operating lights and lots of people in masks and fall back asleep; me as a 5yr old getting my tonsils removed.
Why would he RUN?
I woke up during surgery when I was 24, getting 2 plates and 14 screws out of my arm. I didn’t feel a thing and they kinda just laughed and put me out again. I woke up later in the recovery room
I really can’t tell if he’s joking
Imagine sausages falling from your body
Me... the doctor surprised as my hand start roaming but i fell sleepy as hell and sleep again. But then wake up again, getting my hand tied and sleep again. During my cs, i even woke up and trying to see my stomach tru the operating lamp, failed, and going to sleep again.lol
I woke up during a minor heart procedure . No pain. Just heard the talking and felt vibrations.
I shouldn’t be laughing…
Not the lulu bag 😭🤚
I once woke up at the dentist when getting my cavities filled, I just remember lifting my head in a panic and feeling a nurse leaning over my legs. And a hand on my head pushing me down, then I knocked out again🤣
I have a resistance to medication and I have woken up during several surgeries starting with my tonsillectomy when I was 7. Epidurals don't work on me either.  I tried with my first two children and just gave up trying with the last two.  I had an anesthesiologist once tell me that he had heard of it before,  but I was the first that he had seen.  It's a strange thing to experience.
TOO EASY 💪
I think being aware of what's happening but unable to say or do anything would be scarier than waking up in the middle of it
What happens if you *WALE* up in the middle of surgery
You are well respected for your skills and advice. Please don't destroy this by telling this type of bologna. Remember the words of a Doctor are sometimes taken as absolute truth.  Truthfully the patient would have bled to death before he got to the hospitals exit doors.
Nah that is something that would happen in Florida
I'm not buying it. He's not buying it plan be. True story. Me. Still not buying it
Crazy!!
Wale up*
Lol and I have surgery in 7 hours.
Did he die tho
Et!
AHHHHHHHHH U
I once was woken up during surgery while they were cutting a piece of Colum from me and I remembered panicking randomly and the doctors were scared when they saw me and quickly got me to sleep again.
I was 12 when I had to get my tonsils removed. When It was surgery, my anesthetic failed and I woke up mid surgery. I was subconscious and since there was a huge tube in my mouth, I moved around a lot in "pain", or at the very least was struggling a lot. Due to my sheer body size, weight and power, they has to have 10 doctors to hold me down while the 11th doctor proceeded to give me another dose of anesthesia. It was my mom who told me what happened since she was a nurse there, and all I remember was a white circular light over my head.
That happened to my grandpa once.....he just passed out from all the blood and stuff 😂❤️
My sister woke up during an appendectomy. She said the doctors were joking around and she felt cold, very very cold. And asked for the nurses for some blankets 😂
This one E.R. doc told me a story of how he woke up in the middle of a colonoscopy(I might have spelled that wrong). He was like: "I am never doing that again. I felt the camera moving around! It was extremely weird and uncomfortable..."  I don't know how we got into that conversation because my medical issue was lung related. (I have asthma that sends me to the hospital at least 2-3 times a year.)   Either way I was like: "Oof. Colonoscopies are already a pain to do. The prep for one is time consuming and already not fun!"  For the prep you have to drink magnesium citrate, water, Gatorade and not eat.   I have used magnesium citrate before. It is not fun. You will not leave the bathroom! I used it because I was way too constipated one time and didn't want an enema!
(I'm just gonna dump my experience, if you get bored easily don't take the time to read lol)  I hate this, I've experienced this as they were bone graphing my hips and I legit got PTSD after that because I thought I was dying as I couldn't tell if I was breathing and my body was so numb to the point i was dissociated with myself. Imagine dying in space where you try to ask for help but there is no oxygen so you just get strangled as your lungs is numb and body paralyzed. It feels exactly like that and also because I was actually dreaming of that when I blacked out once they gave me more. It was hella scary when when I first woke up because I heard repeated voices of my name and a endless cycle of beeping sounds that can give you chills as it fades in and out and I couldn't tell if they kept repeating my voice or my brain was repeating this. I tried to cry or say something but it felt like I didn't exist and existed. I now hate surgeries but I had 10 just to keep me living and still counting but now I tried to avoid them since its so scary and I don't wanna help myself.
Giving me PTSD of becoming a spartan
Hey so I forgot this
I woke up early during the last part of a procedure. It was pretty uncomfortable. I'm just glad it didn't happen when I got my appendix out.
It can happen (rarely) you need to have a special disorder which makes anesthetics effect you less. You wake up but your paralyzed you can see hear and feel what's happening but can't move or do anything about it. So the whole surgery however many hours you will feel in excruciating pain every single cut. Luckily all instances of this happening the patient survived. So basically, you could wake up but you should be fine in the end.
Good job, if you say true story but make a small note for a second, they’ll watch it again and I can say whatever I want
How to die 101
You didn't explain what happens if you wake up. Lol this has actually happened to me twice. I would love to hear what happens, because that's definitely NOT. They put you back to sleep FACTS
This is where speed is not an option
Narrator: Not a true story.
oh crap
Do they feel the pain tho thats the question.
There is no way. I couldnt even sit up on my own after a laparoscopy
While they were fixing a hole in my mothers heart they didn't have to put her under and they asked if my mom wanted to watch them do the procedure.  She said heck yeah she wants to see how they do the operation and both her and the doctors were just chatting about medical stuff while they were pushing a sort of tiny umbrella through the veins in her leg up to her heart to plug up a hole xD
I did once, it wasn't bad I immediately fell back to sleep
GOD LOVES ALL YOU SM
When he said carrying his intestines in a bag I was like 😮🤭😂
Imagine just walking and seeing someone  with intestines in a bag
Love the part where he tells up what happens.
Oona: he crazied himself to sleep
My dad did that when they were doing a servery on him (Something with his junk I forget what) but he woke up in the surgery and said "OwWWwwwWWw that HuuUUuUrTs"
I woke up in the middle of having my ankle reconstructed, made a comment about my nurse being to prego to be on her feet and then I passed back out.  F.y.i Its fucking weird to see a doc running a drill into your own bone.
I started waking up during my eye surgery. I became conscious and could barely move. I started whimpering so they gave me more anesthesia.
Holy shi-
My dad woke up in surgery one time. Because he is a massive, and tall, guy, they needed to give him a little bit more anesthesia than they did, but because they didnt meet the required dosage, he woke up during surgery and he just said "oh, pink." Then fell back to sleep.
Spain without the s
What’s with the Jared Kushner photo? Was he the one that woke up?
You don't feel anything if they numb it you just go back to sleep
i woke up when the doctor was performing cesarean with me. i think its normal.
I'm so afraid of anesthesia awareness.
I was have surgery on my arm and I remember crying out that my arm was causing me pain and someone saying you're not supposed to be awake and then waking up in recovery. They didn't give me much anesthesia coz I was pregnant at the time
Bro. Pinksock to another level.
Had surgery on my feet the day after Michael Jackson died and woke up tp the doctors talking about it, stayed awake for the rest of the surgery.
So he ran  with his intestines out and nobody in the hospital stop him?
If you wake up during it. Just knock yourself out it’s as easy as that
The lulu lemon bag had me laughing 🤣😂🤣😂
I woke up in the middle of them removing my wisdom teeth. They woke me up on purpose though. The oral surgeon was like: "Arielle, I need you to open your mouth a little wider so I can put the rubber block on the other side of your mouth. We're half way done."  I was loopy from the anesthesia but didn't feel any pain. I simply relied: "Oh okay sure, sorry about that..." Before letting the oral surgeon move the rubber block to the other side of my mouth.  Last thing he said was: "Thank you."  I just replied with: "No problem dude." Then went back to sleep until the end of surgery. The anesthesia was strong and I actually started to fall asleep standing up when surgery was over and they were sending me home. A nurse and my mother had to help me walk and get me into the car.
I woke up multiple times when I had a leg surgery. One time, I was singing along to the background music (one of my favorite local bands). Another time, I asked one of the doctors if I could see my leg and he was like, "Uhh, you better not. It's not something you see everyday." Lmao. But I only stayed up for a few seconds and got knocked out again.
I accualy woke up but then the anesthesiologist played my head back and I was knocked cold the funny thing I couldn't feel a thing and I just lifted my head
You’re kinda making me not gonna go to a hospital.
My grandma was awake during her eye surgery I guess they weren't supposed to put her to sleep for some reason. I feel bad for her she must've went through alot of pain....
I-
1 question....does it hurt if you woke up-
i believed everything up to the lululemon bag, any broke person like me knows that if you get a lulu bag you ain’t putting anything but off brand lulu clothes in it
My hand feel soo weak
I woke up during my first colonoscopy.
Imagine that:"hey guys I have my intestines on this bag"
My brother did! He woke up in the middle of his surgery ! He did. He suffered a fracture. He said the doctor pulled off a curtain right infront of his eyes to avoid him from looking at the ongoing drilling on his leg
I woke up in the middle of my back surgery
So...why did you show a picture of Jared Kushner? How was that relevant?
I woke up whilst a dental surgeon was using a hammer and chisel to carve my wisdom teeth outta my head. I was like "whooooa not good not good KNOCK ME OUT" and they did
I remember reading somewhere that there is a patient that woke up in the middle of surgery and can't move because of anesthesia so the doctors didn't know. apparently anesthesia didn't fully work so the patient can feel the pain while the surgery is ongoing.
I wrecked my dirt bike as a teenager and woke up during what the doctors called a none invasive surgery to see the doctor pop my wrist bone back in place. It didn't hurt just felt pressure then my wrist popped but I always felt that was a cool experience
I woke up during surgery twice so far in my life, and a third time where the anesthesia didn’t work beyond me being unable to move or signal I was still conscious during an endoscopy, absolutely sucked and they only got me under as they were removing the camera from my throat
Well they should have figured that he was awake just look at his eyes
Imagine if the doctor should said welcome to future son we have upgraded you..
BS...I've woke up twice. You don't run.
I heard a story about a guy who woke up during surgery and he died from a heart attack
.... 😲 😱
and it was jared kushner? :D
Once when I was in the 5th grade i got I surgery done. And before they started the surgery one docter had like about 5 big injunctions next to him, and I got very scared so he injuncted half of all those 5 injunctions till I fell a sleep and my mom was right beside me. And my mom told me that they informed my family the moment my surgery was done and I slept for hours after the surgery was done. And the best part was i got to eat ice cream the hole time. And I only had to stay at the hospital for 2 days.
They kill you. You know too much.
🧍🚕🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸🚑💉👨‍⚕️👩‍⚕️👨‍⚕️👩‍⚕️💊💊💊💊🤢🤮🤒🤕☺️✨
My grandmother had to get cataract surgery once and they forgot to give her anesthesia after making it where she cant move (unable to move physically not because of restraints lol) and she felt the whole thing while they removed it.
A lululemon bag... Bet he had egg on his face.
There was a movie called Awake ,young man woke up during his open heart surgery,still haunts me😬😬
😂😂😂 not the lululemon bag 😂
Ah yes, good thing to know early in the morning.      Im not getting off bed now
Damn! That's insane!
You look like 456 from squid game
That’s my worst fear
Holy shit that man Didn’t even die what a Mad lad
Hey is that ivanka trumps husband?
I maybe need to operate my hand becuase its broken snd im very nervous😔
If wake up during middle of surgery u die from pain
Lmao fake story
Everyone's stories about horrible doctors make me feel so much better about my traumatic hospital experience. At least we all know we're not alone now!!
😂 Thanks for the nightmare fuel Doc! I'm in the hospital right now waiting for them to give me a bowel resection 😳 Yes I saw the note where this wasn't true lol
Fine Case Of Anesthesia Awareness.
This explains sooo much about Jared Kushner lol
Happened to me yep... during back lipo .... went back to sleep
I just look at them like wassip
I woke up in middle of a upper G.I member everyone in these silver out fits. My mom thought I was dreaming lol the nurse said no she did. She said no she said everyone was in silver outfits. She said yes we do!
My dad did when he was getting hip surgery and he said “I can feel that” and boom back to sleep
THATS MY DAD
Very unnecessary story to tell. I didn't need to hear that..... Ever. 🖕🖕
One time I woke up during surgery when they were cutting off a big chunk of my skin bc of some reaction to diapers. Since I was four, I screamed for my mother as I should and then they just put me back to sleep. I will never forget seeing that piece of skin being cut off, disgusting 😀
But dosent the anesthesia paralyze you?
Ya right go back to sleep hahaha
My aunt woke up during the amputation of both of her lower legs. She was traumatized.
lolol imagine being the operator and getting the Lululemon bag given to you and looking into it and seeing your patient’s intestines inside💀
This is scary
I woke up during the last part of my central line surgery when I was 7. Freaked me out.
Why am I laughing at this😂 like seriously
My mom woke up during her Caesar birth surgery (my little brother's labor) bcs the doctor didn't gave her enough dose of anesthetic. She said she can feel her stomach gaping open and the hands of the surgeons touching her insides. She only said 'it hurts so much' to the surgeon and they finally gave her more dose of anesthetic
Ohmygosh
My dad once woke up during his wisdom teeth removal
I woke up during my blepharoplasty. The doctor told me to tolerate it and proceeded to make it at least twice as painful. He tried to provide a distraction by telling me to become a Christian, right after I explained that I had a traumatic church experience in the past.
I sure was about to Google it 🤣
This story might be fake, but I'm sure it's happened before.
I do know of someone that woke up mid brain surgery. And they had to frantically put him back under. He was never the same again mentally or emotionally.  He woke up to see the scalpel inches from his face.  Led to a massive lawsuit.
It was the carrying the intestines in a Lululemon bag for me
😧
I woke up during a cardiac ablation. Only for a brief few seconds, but I just have opened my eyes as I recall seeing the ugly beige ceiling and vaguely hearing talking before they pretty quickly knocked me back out.  Much weirder was when I came to too early in recovery. It was also for a different attempt at a cardiac ablation, and they hadn't yet removed the arterial sheathes. I have never experienced anything so otherworldly as feeling them pull them out of me while I was conscious. I didn't exactly hurt, but it wasn't pleasant, either.
Bro wttttff😩
Him runs out  Me:smart
Ok I low key woke up during an upper endoscopy… so I wasn’t totally “out” but I asked the dr if it really happened because I could sort of recall waking up… he said I did 😟 I think my adrenaline was so high maybe it kicked off the crap they gave me?? Anyways I was a nervous wreck before the procedure lol
Using Jared Kushners photo for this lmao
Growing up I got used to my dad having lots of back surgeries including 2 spinal fusions, and a electric spinal box implant and removal to name some. One of his spinal fusions he woke up in. He said he could feel some pain, but it wasn't much more than his usual pai. Level. He could smell blood however and he says he remembers smelling something gross and like burning. He could also feel the pressure of them pulling and the cold tools. He was probably cocoons about 20 to 30 minutes. He tried to sue the hospital but this was early/mid 2000's and a lot of stuff wasn't documented right. It was hard for him to sue and make all his court dates because of his recovery but no one cared. It's in his records but only found when you dig.   My mom also just had a procedure last Monday. She's been having serious stomach and intestinal issues so she had a colonoscopy and some endoscope thing in her throat down to her stomach. She was put under for it and woke up during it. She started to shake because of the tubing and stuff in her throat and vomited all over and nearly choked on that. She told me this all looped up when I picked her up. The nurses told me nothing about it and said it was all well. I'm mad they messed up the anesthesia and she woke up fully and was litterally choking.
I woke up during a surgery and let me tell you, it was a ten-second nightmare, the pain was excruciating. I don't know if the anesthesiologist messed up or what else, at least they fixed things fairly quickly.
you can’t even run out the door if you wake up After surgery
There is a radio talkshow host that has to be under incredible amount of sedation for surgery because he has been known to wake up five or six times during even minor surgery.

It happened to me!!! I was in the middle of a hysterectomy and I woke up because I was under a lot of pain and I was feeling how the surgeon was cutting off my uterus, it hurt sooo much and I told him, so he ordered the anesthesian to inyect more anesthesia and like 30 seconds later I went to sleep again!
What the text said if you couldn’t read it fast enough: Just kidding. I’ve performed 1000’s of operations under general anesthesia and never had a patient wake up during surgery
Well that doesn’t explain what happens. Last thing I would do is wake up and run outta the hospital lmao. I’ve woken up during oral surgery literally 5 times the surgeon told me. 2 of which I painfully remember. They had to strap me down to the Jesus table but i made it through!
My mother has woken up during surgery before, she has a VERY high resistance to anesthetic. They realized quickly and upped her dose, putting her back to sleep as quickly as she woke up.
I woke up during my tubal ligation it wS ummm interesting
It's fine, if you wake up, just go back to sleep. It's as simple as that
This doc cracks me up!!!  Love his posts!!!
I actually have woken up during a procedure before and started talking. They told me to stop talking and gave me more anesthesia so I fell back asleep.
A friend of mine woke up while having surgery on his arm. He propped himself up on his other arm, watching the surgeon work. After a while, the surgeon noticed and screamed bloody murder at the anesthesiologist to knock him out. True story!  He had warned them ahead of time that he was drug resistant but they didn’t listen.
I thought you were for real tho
At least he’s staying trendy with out his organs lol
My brother in law woke up during gall bladder surgery a long time ago, before laparoscopic surgery.  He raised his head and watched as they were removing things from his abdomen.  He said they were talking non-surgery talk.  They noticed he was awake and suddenly he went back to sleep.  Afterwards he told them he remembered waking up during the surgery, but they played it down and basically ignored him.
Sooo what happens?
