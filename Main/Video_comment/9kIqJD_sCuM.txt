Respect, but I think it’s a little disrespectful to talk about his faith in Islam while at the same time referring to his girl as his “bitch” and showing off busty models in the music video.   Glad he’s on the right path though.

“We will show them Our signs in the universe and in their own selves, until it becomes manifest to them that this (the Quran) is the truth” (Quran; 41:53).  In Surah Al-Anbya, Allah (SWT) also states: “Have those who disbelieved not considered that the heavens and the earth were a joined entity, and We separated them” (Quran, 21:30). In 1929, American astronomer Edwin Hubble proposed the Hubble’s Law according to which all entities in space are moving away from the Earth at speeds proportional to their distance i.e. the greater the distance from earth, the faster they are moving. Soon after this, he discovered that galaxies are moving away from each other as well which means that the universe is expanding overall.  This laid the basis for the Big Bang theory which states that around 12-15 billion years ago the universe came into existence from one single extremely hot and dense point, due to an explosion of this point the universe came into being. The universe, since then, has been expanding from this single point. In 1965, radio astronomers Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson won the Noble Prize for the discovery that confirmed the Big Bang theory. When looking at the verse cited above, while acknowledging Allah Knows best, it remains astounding that the Quran had already revealed that “the heavens and the earth were a joined entity, and We separated them”  Again, in Surah Al-Anbya, Allah (SWT) says: “The Day when We will fold the heaven like the folding of a [written] sheet for the records. As We began the first creation, We will repeat it. [That is] a promise binding upon Us. Indeed, We will do it” (Quran, 21:104). This fits in with the theory of Big Crunch which talks about how the universe will be pulled back into the black holes and again form a tiny mass.  In Surah Al-Anbya, Allah (SWT) says: “And We made the sky a protected ceiling, but they, from its signs, are turning away” (Quran 21:32). It is a scientific fact that the sky, with all of its gasses, protects the earth and life that is present on it from the harmful rays of the sun. If there was no protective layer, life on earth would cease to exist as the temperature on earth would be freezing at -270.556°C, the same as the temperature in space.  In Surah Al-Anbya, it states “And it is He who created the night and the day and the sun and the moon; all [heavenly bodies] in an orbit are swimming” (Quran, 21:33). Although it was only a widespread belief in the 20th century amongst the astronomers, today it is a well-established fact that the Sun, the Moon, and all the other bodies in the Universe are moving in an orbit and constantly moving, not stationary as commonly thought before.   This and many other scientific miracles from the Quran could not have been known 1444 years ago by any human beings.

His voice is annoying 😅
HUH? He claiming muslim but rapping about enjoying all the evils of this life. Please help me understand. Annnd he talking about not snitching as if that was the reason he got locked up, smh. Ain nobody have to tell, he self snitched while braggin about killing our people with heroin. Ive seen so called muslims backing and encouraging his behavior. Then this guy kneels in a PARKING LOT to pray? Please somebody make it make sense. They shouldve kept this nigga, putting him back on the streets to continue killing us with his drugs and demonic lyrics ain right!
🔥

'For this God is our God for ever and ever: he will be our guide even unto death.   (Psalm 48:14) 'In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.   (John 1:1) 'As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one: There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God. They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.   (Romans 3:10-12) 'For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus’ sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh.   (2 Corinthians 4:11) 'My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation is from him. He only is my rock and my salvation: he is my defence; I shall not be moved.   (Psalm 62:5-6) 'He that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit. Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.   (1 Corinthians 6:17-18) 'In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.   (1 Corinthians 15:52-53) 'For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.   (Romans 8:13) - Get on your knees right now and pray to God in the name of Jesus Christ.

#RALOFREE yessir the message is out!
'For all the gods of the people are idols: but the LORD made the heavens. Glory and honour are in his presence; strength and gladness are in his place.   (1 Chronicles 16:26-27) 'Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold, thy King cometh unto thee: he is just, and having salvation; lowly, and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of an ass.   (Zechariah 9:9) 'Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? then may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil.   (Jeremiah 13:23) 'And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it; For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.   (Matthew 26:27-28) 'And the LORD shall help them(the righteous), and deliver them: he shall deliver them from the wicked, and save them, because they trust in him.   (Psalm 37:40) 'Moreover whom he(God) did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.   (Romans 8:30) 'By faith he(Moses) forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.   (Hebrews 11:27) 'Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.   (Ephesians 6:11)

Welcome home Ralo !!!   But y’all are sleeping on Joe Green..
Damn this Nigga just sat behind bars for five years. The police throughout America coordinated with one another to arrest him. They literally just took five years of his life away from him. He will never be able to get those five years back. And the first thing he does when he gets out of jail is say the police can’t stop shit. Damn talk about still being ignorant.  Talk about not learning how to fly under the radar.
RESPEKT✍🏽🗣🙏🏾

Obv rapping is not his #1 skill. Compare this to Tee Grizzy first dat out. I still support him though. Cause hes a hustler, and made it out the mud.. even with the odds stacked against him.
When he come to jesus he gone go hard for Jesus
He got better ❤
So he talking about his religion whilst swearing, talking about riding, retaliating, spinning and bragging about what he’s going to do 😂  And he said he still prays someone’s in a wheelchair 🤦🏾‍♂️  This guys completely lost

Ohhh he back, Oh he back back!!!!! 💥💥💥💥💥
He popped his shit
This man on his face to Allah & then rapping a bunch of foolishness. I keep telling people Islam is a false religion. It has NOT the Spirit of The Living God Yahweh. Islam especially the Nation of Islam ☪️ is a black orchestrated gang. These brothers need to repent of their sins & of this false doctrine & turn to the Lord Jesus Christ that they may be saved. God have mercy!
🔥🔥🔥🔥

Something about money yo bag an I’ll never go against my oops they know I love the law wtf
I don’t really condone drugs and violence (the streets) … but this one of the hardest records I heard from a street dude in a while. Real hip hop. Even tho I don’t agree with what he saying (all the street nonsense) but I am glad to hear a RAPPER actually TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING other then cars and hoes. I genuinely enjoyed the record. Flow was solid and again actually had something to say.
This new era not standing on business i salute the one's really stand on business my brother been gone since 97 on business 💯.. how they getting out so fast so there drugs different than ones doing 15 plus years.

She say she's woke, he say he's woke but the news tell a different story. So that you will know, ...whatever the brain feed on, that's what you will become. If your brain feed on trash, you will become trash. If your brain feed on gold, your actions will become golden. The hood is so foul because all they feed on is garbage. If the people was woke for real, it would show.

Ion respect him already throwin CMG in his music.!I feel like he clout chasin to have relevant music. I even like the song. Well kinda. But ion respect it!
Real 🐐 put damn near his whole city on his back and gave back to the ones that needed it ! Not many real bosses left ✨💨
Please don't support rats
Ralo stood on it before his imprisonment, he stood tall on everything he did whilst in prison, and now he out he ain't folded his hand. Now that's what you can call real! I didn't like his music too much before because of the flow but I respected his story. This song though, got me. He in his bag. Sometimes those setbacks really push us forward. Don't let that go over ya heads ! FAMGOON
Now he Muslim
Real niggas do real shit 🫡

WELCOME HOME KING 👑👌🙏🙏🙏
Exactly what ..the white investors..want ..B people/ninjas, just can't stop hiphop..the weapon that destroys young minds ..fills jails,fills graves..this ain't music..not even lyrical talent..country illiterate, but he is what? He is an influencer..and that's what he is given money for..to help the population control of his own people..😮truth hurts..wake up..people ..B.people..
I'm Muslim and ralo approach is something he should've thought about before he opened his mouth..the dissing then speaking about Allah like as Muslims we don't do this. But speaking on CMG is something he had to say but for what tho? If you Muslim be Muslim if you want gangsta then be that..word to u ralo is, live like u move. Peace and blessing!!
WELCOME HOME 💯💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾🖤🙏🏾

I heard the conversation with him and his homeboy, they was talking on the phone, his homeboy was saying that you’re a street nigga, why tf are you cooperating with them people and it sound like Ralo was about to cry, I hope that Ralo didn’t snitch but his homeboy was like he cooperated with them people, was his homeboy lying and was just trying to make Ralo look bad? Or was that what really happened?  If Ralo did cooperate, I guess niggas just got they picks on who they want to label a 🐀
Keep it real 💯💯💯💯🧐🤔

Asking because I’m not Muslim and since his faith seems to be a big part of his life. But for a Muslim is making music using profanity frowned on or even allowed? Just a question? Cause obviously multiple rappers do it.

Me being a Ralo fan, and a Gucci fan, it upsets me that Gucci dropped Ralo from 1017 while he was locked up and didn’t even send the man any money or anything like other rappers did when he got out. Smh gucci. Ralo kept it real and he rode for you the whole time he was signed and you ain’t even acknowledge him.
Welcome home bro

A lot of dck sukaz on this mf, he aint told shit. It already been looked over. The mf that tried to exposed him admitted he was doing that shit to try to promote his own shit. Ralo gave fake names and tried to finesse the feds. How many niggaz incarcerated off ralo ? Everybody he went down wit was free before him. Yall clowns so i get it. Yall niggaz claim to be street but believe anything on some green shit 🤣🤡 streetz kno wassup but if you not in tha city shid just look at 1090 jake shit. That white boy plugged in and hit that info shit. No lies was told n niggaz stamped his shit too

It's bittersweet for me. In time where authenticity in rap is scarce I discovered Ralo. I didn't listen to his music because he was the best rapper. I began listening to him because he seemed authentic and I could intimately relate to the position he operated from.  However, now I cannot bring myself to fully support the brother due to the unresolved paperwork situation. Regardless if he never took the stand and testified or was merely fabricating evidence to subvert being incarcerated. The oath where WE come from forbids us from sitting down with ANY law enforcement official to proffer evidence–be it real or fake–that could potentially incriminate another.  That's what lawyers are for. And if you're going to go that route, then you let the people whom you're paying to take the case come forward and speak to the law officials–that's what you're paying them to do.  That said, if what brother Ralo says is TRUTH, then file a request with the court to unseal all statements and documents involved in the case in question. Be completely transparent my brother. This will remove any and all taint of the alleged transgression.  Here is a passage from the Hadith. The Prophet said this after visiting a market place and sticking his hand into a heap of corn that a trader was selling, only to discover the corn below was wet:  Why did you not keep the wet portion above the dry corn, so that people may see it? He who deceives is not one of us.”  Those traders who cheat customers (us the music consumer) by not showing the true product (you the artist) or hiding flaws of the product they are offering, from their customers are not among the true Muslims according to the judgment of Prophet Muhammad.   My brother Ralo, I am not passing judgment. This comes from a place of love. As muslim you must stand firmly in Islam and let it guide you completely.
Now that's how u come back from prison and represent ya shit !!!!!
🐬🐬🐬🐬💪🏾
I still don’t like Ralo music or voice. Not then or now lol ..

His first song sucks…. I won’t when 2tymes came out , he definitely had a hot song! This sucks . He not catchy at all. I will wait though to see what he canes out with next. This is just a song for the few fans and his friends. You know you won’t hear this on the radio.
This song slaps.  It’s the best first day out I have heard.
First time I'm actually gonna be paying attention and fully supporting I didn't even do that for LIL WAYNE 🤷🏾‍♂️
Big Guy 👑
That shit was riding!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ok ralo out hear making it look juicy we shore didn’t forget about how you got out early and that hoodie with the rat on the back doesn’t make any sense I guess it’s the year of the rat cause it looks like it’s popular to rat come home  and make a video and everyone is excepting and condoning not keeping your mouth shut but ralo was just trying to make it look juicy for the Feds lol smh the rap game is definitely dead….🤣😂😭🤫
Latin Folks in The CHI .RESPECT THIS..

Who else listened to it more than once  👇
My brother ralo everything was good until you said leanrn about Abu Bakr , Umar , and Usman?! My brother please 🙏🏿 know islam properly if not let me help a brother  with history.. they all three stooges killed Ali’s slwt Wife (Daughter of Prophet Muhammad slwt) you know basics of Islam… it sounds good but not sure if you know the real Islam (history) and I am from Pakistan 🇵🇰 real Pakistan 🇵🇰 just saying.  *Respect you for representing Imam Ali slwt .❤
💪🏾🔥🤞🏾
To bad he told
🤲🏾
Now get ready for Kevin Gates to approach you.. Muslim talk
This not it. I’m not even hating
All praise due to Allah 🤲🏿
I swear you can’t talk like a Muslim and not live like one. Hypocrites are in every religion
Still a wack rapper😂
Bismillah

Hey I appreciate this man. Great work dude! This is a cool lil gem for our times we had listening to these verses. What was y'all doing when we was bumping these??
That's how you do it!
This shit hard🔥🔥🔥 I ain’t expect this, Goodluck champ!
I feel like Ralo has so much potential but they always mix his vocals just like every other artist. He has a unique voice its like a little more high pitched & kind of nasally. I feel like a good engineer needs to make hime a vocal chain that is unique to his voice and hell be outta here.
Inshallah
Told my wife last night he was gonna drop a first day out video. All u rappers follow the same blueprint 😅
THE REAL IS BACK...FAM GOON!!!

#TTRLA APPROVES THIS KRANK
Islam ☪️ is a false religion.Ishmael was not the chosen seed of Abraham. Issac & Jacob was are the chosen.The Ishmaelite were the first to enslave blacks.Even till this day The Muslims of Morocco & Lybia enslave blacks.Y’all nigga quick to jump on a bang wagon just because a rapper speaks about something.Black Americans are Hebrew Israelites we’re not the descendants of Ishmael so therefore Islam ☪️ does not come from our culture
