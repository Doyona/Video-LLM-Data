He gets the kids every fortnight for a weekend
Iu
Even your sponsorship segments are entertaining👁👄👁
yay sponsor!
Definitely underrated, big things ahead for you mate,  Ciarán to the moon🚀
Hmmm, pouch seems a awful like Honey
If Ciarán can get Hayden Christenssen to drink with him I'd be sold on this being the best channel ever, and I'm not far from it tbh! Almost watched all vids
noo
Shouldnt be drinking in ANY weatherspoons you fucking tory
0:59, If I saw this bit on a crime documentary thing I would believe this to be 100% legit!
So pouch is just a better honey
The intro alone is basically a trailer
0:53 if phyllis from the office had a son
Good luck mate !
You sound exactly like Richard ayoade
Good for you  🤩 we can see the quality!!! I will honestly try to watch your content from now on
i legit got an ad for braces made to make you smile more.  this must mean something
hmm pouch. Wow origional
3:51 is he ok
looking forward to what you produce in the future!!
Hope you make it to the 1mill mark and above Ciaran, your humour is too good to go unnoticed
Is this legit did he actually leave? I'm to lazy to watch the whole thing
Gotta say ciaran you always seemed so bored in all the reaction videos on wills channel, now i know why. Seeing you in one of your own videos actually makes me see you in a different light, a good one, your more comical and interested... gonna sub, wish you the best of luck! p.s thanks for not making some bullshit story about why you left
This makes me sad
You earned my sub
Good luck dude... you are very entertaining and way better than... actually not naming anyone.
Good luck Ciarán wish you the best hammie
So basically you used him to get subs and left but still good edits In the vid
Pouch is just a shit honey
Well, You my favourite youtuber anyway....
the glasses on/glasses off section earned the like instantly
You’ve come a long way from being a ref on stat wars mate
Very annoyed that you slagged off Sed I've got a photo of him on my lamp which I never want to turn off now - but with that being said, love the quality of this!
Shut up
Best to you Ciarán, you and Will are both top lads who've brought me hundreds of hours of entertainment and laughs. At least three of those hours has come from watching you guys' videos. If you want me to drum up some fake controversy in a few months to get you cancelled so you've really made it, just hit me up. Give my PA a call.
So basically the guy used willne to get subs,nice
Ciaran im so fucking glad you have a channel
Editor: Ciarán Also Editor: Ciarán
Pouch is basically a honey rip off
Yay! Go you! :)
It
Is it just me or in the thumbnail does he look like Klaus from The Vampire Diaries
Still miss the comments show :(
Pouch is definitely not honey
Proper underrated channel this 💯
Well deserved and brilliant editing again.
You look like Finn Balor in your thumbnail
This is epic but soooooo weird
Damn, he even got the honey rip off. Hope pouch pays even better
I remember when u were on 10 k 😂
The thumbnail is giving me “why I left buzzfeed” vibes
5th Eboy??
I only have one request...please don’t change the outro song! Best song ever! 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
This Ciarán bloke is really stepping up his game in 2021! 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
2:37 is that the rubbish version of honey???
This is actually beautifully shot
Ive just realized how much he looks like Mr Bean
I can't wait for your own brand of unique videos. But even Big boy Square head and his posse are still making the those tikitok/reddit/whatever shitty videos. Don't let the algorithm screw you out of monetising your creativity
Good luck!
Honey will be fuming!
Honey: yeah you can copy my homework just change a few words  Pouch: 🗿
pouch is literaly a honey clone
snelle planga 1:55
the Schalke Shau guy turned into this! I'm super impressed by Ciaran!
Ok so can we take a second to talk about how he has a throne
Bloody subbed. Excited for this content
Holy shit! I was just about to order those shoes the other day. They’re $250 here in America so I was gonna use Afterpay and break it up into four payments, but it still couldn’t force myself to go through with it. I think this was my sign tho. I’m gonna do it.
I love the into for this 😍
yo it's that guy from money heist
I liked it w Willne rip
I like marshmallows, so I'm gonna live in a marshmallow

No offence but who has honestly heard of pouch like just saying but it sounds like a rip off Honey
Damn this is worse than my parents divorce
Turkish guy were are you?
Could kind of tell...
Shirt answer he’s a massive schlong
I’m still crying about the break up 😫
Pouch v Honey
The intro is great
You’re easily one of the funniest people on YouTube would love for you, Stephen Tries & Jaackmaate to Collab.
I like editing videos
KNOCKOFF HONEY POG
Love you man always loved your vids. Can always come here to laugh. Been here since 90+1 facts❤❤❤

Wow fallen a long way since playing Gollum in Lord of the Rings, Andy Serkis! xD
You’re literally the best hahahahahahaha
He just put the glasses on and took them off 😂😂😂
Pouch sounds like Honey
Never knew Ciaran hand moves🔥
“I managed to suck off wills audience of off him” I don’t think that’s the right terminology friend
Change your mind🗣, the Kingdom of God is coming. Do it with me. All you have to say is I accept it. That's it. 🥰👍🏼  'He is coming' 'Those who don't believe in Him will be destroyed' 'Jesus came to give me life' 'I will perish/be destroyed If i don't accept Jesus Christ as my Lord and saviour.' 'I will be judged for not believing in the son of God.' 'I will loose my life, if I do what I want' 'I will find my life only If I sacrifice my life for Him' 'The truth sets me free' 'God loves me, he offered up his son to make sure I will not be destroyed but to end up living with Him forever.'   You made it through!!!🥇 Now join me, on this race. Be part of the 1% with me. 👫👭 Save yourself from this perverse generation!!!🗣 God offered you the life of his son.
He advertised bootleg honey

Stho Many Lithsps
Well done kids crying now 🤦🏻‍♂️😢😂
As a British person we always after work go and seat in our royal throne while drinking a beer
Get Ewan McGregor and Hayden Christensen to startle a fight in the street outside of one of the Wetherspoons
I really do love you
Good
Thanks Ciarán.....the kids are crying....fuck sake
Pouch is knockoff honey
ive said it before and ill say it again: ciarans voice sounds exactly like richard ayoade
Its because Will was never square with Ciarán.
Pouch is basically a rip off of honey
Just subbed.. Well done ciarán great start 👏
I rate you fully bro,deserve this and more
Please  learn  how to edit Alex's scene 😂
5:40 Alex 🤣🤣
TRAITOR!! (You got this my dude!!)
The real reason he left willne is so he can do a sponser that copyed honey
Anyone think Ciarán radiates massive James Acaster energy?
Please tell me you're still mates with Willne tho 🥺
Is that just me or was there an imallex I heard in the background
how did this get on to 22 on trending
your video edits are class and you don't shout and bleed my ears like Will xo
Mans sponsored by bteck honey
💩
Now all I want to see is Hayden Christensen in a Wetherspoons with Ciaran
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteous. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Lol pouch = btec honey
im distracted by your moustache wtf did you do to the right side :O its like will sneaked into your bedroom and sliced you for revenge haha
and he couldnt even milk it to 10 mins 😂 come on ciaran man youre basically a comentry youtuber you need to get to 10 man
When you can’t get a brand deal with honey.”use pouch”
pouch Is honey in a mask
better breakup video than David dobrik
Great to see Ciran doing what he wants, been subbed since he was bellow 10k subs at FD
Next step on the timeline is to now hire your own editor.
so pouch is just Honey with a different name
Handsome local man
I love your dry humour bro it has me creasing every video!
Good job going solo
you're smashing it
Good on you. You can have my interaction. A comment AND a like.
Quick recommendation of a football top get Galatasary away kit
At the end of the day, you were doing the bulk of the work to help build Will’s dream. Now, youre able to work and achieve your own. You have to respect a person who bets it all on himself. Youre hilarious mate and youll do well
Ciaràn  deserves to be in the eboys.  Im glad that will and your other friends helped you become a youtuber . Will is deffinatly missing your editing 🤣
ciaran should be one of the eboys
pouch is literaly a 1:1 clone of honey lool
I know you won’t reply to this. But ciarán my friend. Your editing is the dogs bollocks and I’m glad to be here 🤙🏼🔥
Wills videos are shite and unfunny

This is a genius video. Hilarious original content. I can't wait to see more in the future. 🙌🙌
Ciarán giving off them Wheatley vibes
honey is not going to be happy about this sponsor
Is pouch just honey?
Loved the little cheeky city xtra plug!
Top video, top guy.
The intense music is so great in the begining ^^
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Why gotta be such a bait thumbnail :/
This is a bit like the always sunny episode that takes the piss out of making a murderer.love it!
.....so pouch is an off brand Honey so we are clear right?
...im sorry..i didnt know how to pronounce your name and assume its "sierran"...so when you said your name the first time, all i heard was "karen"
i like ciarán carlin’s channel.
Stunning work Ciaran :)
What is I use pouch and honey do I become god?
5:06 George: I don’t have such weakness
Man really did sponsor a b-tech honey
You should do an epic diss track on him to get more views and subs
Isn’t pouch just ripping off honey?
Ciaran the way you progressed from editing for will to a well established YouTuber is sick
🤣 He's saying Pouch works in more websites in the UK and I haven't got a single discount from them...
I’ve never wanted a YouTuber to succeed as much as this guy!
Knock off honey
pog
Great you just gave Will a video for him to steal for his second channel
It's free, idk why you wouldn't do it.... Already have honey?
Will can’t even upload without you 🤣
at the start i thought i’d clicked on the wrong vid
Mate these videos are insanely good. I can't wait for the next ones!🖤
Ciaran is class
Is it wrong I actuslly wanna see you walk around to pubs with Hayden Christiansen
Ehh Pouch is just Honey but worse
Pure class mate
1:52 just putting the glasses on and taking them off made me sh*t myself laughing
So basically you only to the job willne offered you so you could be a leach  How disappointing
Fucking ❤️ your videos
This is shot like a murder episode and I love it
Nice video
Pouch= when you aren't big enough for Honey
FERRIS BEULER IS AMAZING YOU JUST GOT MY SUB
Fun fact: I used this video to lure the live mouse my cat brought in to catch it and release it.
what if i mix pouch and honey? will i become the ultime shopper
I was expecting The mr Beast editor thing again
Pouch, because you hate bees...
That is Awesome mang! Good Shit!
bro it seems like a shitpost, but also hella serious, liek,,, quality omg
I watch every single one of these videos and they just get better every week.
Pouch is a rip off honey
OJ AND NICOLE omfg 💀
7:42 “I wouldn’t do a sponsor if I don’t believe in it” I have a feeling this isn’t gonna age well...
Next video: not laughing at TikToks
Been watching since about 20k subs, the comments show on EFD was the highlight of my week - good luck going solo!
Can’t wait to see what you do with the channel! And if I lived in the UK I would download pouch because that transition was 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
Update: Ciaran has CAKE 🤷🏼‍♀️
Pouch looks almost like Honey 🍯
yesss ciaran take over we all surport
I honestly think you make the best quality videos that are bloody funny😂 hope you hit 1mil sooner rather than later because you deserve it brother
mans couldn’t get honey 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Yeah Will is such a monster you can do better, queen 👑
Hi mate, I’m an accountant so if you need help please email me, I won’t charge anything at all. Just want you to get where you need to be
That is the most beautiful segue way to a brand deal i have ever seen
You've been absolutely smashing these videos lately
Beans
editing in this video is a whole lot better, can definately see an improvement since leaving S2W
You made Will's videos 10x better, but you deserve way more. You're an incredible creator, extremely talented. Can't wait to see more of you!
I've had intense insomnia for years, been prescribed many medicines, drugs and consultants, and I haven't had a good night's sleep in almost a decade. But tonight, after watching this shite I feel like I can rest. Kidding it was a class vid I just thought of that and decided to be a twat xo
Bruh pouch is literally copying everyhting honey too, same colour scheme and similar font and everyhting like wtf
Your editing skills are *chef's kiss*
Oh Ciaran you do make me laugh 🤣
Once more, I am commenting for engagement, oh holy one
Well guess I have to watch every video from now
your editing is so sick! i’m loving this
I fucking love you Ciarán. Made me want to start YouTube this year!
Disgrace
I love you
Ciaran interviewing ciaran is great
i really do believe you'll become success from these videos, feel like ive never seen this style of videos before
give it a year and this channel's gonna be unrecognisably popular. So excited to see what you can get up to with all this freedom!!   Also please never change your outro it's the best
hmm pouch seems familiar
Love it well done Ciaran, looking forward to seeing where this takes you!!

If you don’t reach 1 mil by the end of 2021 there is no justice in this world
All the best luck but it’ll be sad to see one of my favourite duo’s go.
Most people who make videos like this say that the youtuber they worked for was a twat, but just did it cuase you wanted to
B-Tec honey
This is so good I just can't
this is some high quality content right here
Ciaran your videos are brilliant! Keep it up!
Women. Women in general. I love women. Specially women. Ones in general. Women. I love women. You know who doesn’t. Shane dawson. He likes cats

Ciaran you are a genius.
This sounds like a pyramid scheme
So you can say the n word
WillNE Industries. 😂
Underrated
Based on this ad, you're the UK equivalent of Noel. Love it.
You’re better then the eboys altogether
Top notch pal.
what happened to honey! now there is puch, its a complete rip off, their logos are even the same colour and font
Can’t wait to see you hit, one mill
does this remind anyone else of tgf's lockdown thing.
Why did you call honey ‘pouch’?
Bet will died
Will you still do videos with WillNE like a collaboration or something?
I still don't hear his lisp. I guess I've been around people with acute-severe lisp syndrome
How long did it take you to edit this video? Nice 👌
Ciaran mate ur gonna bang this keep up the good work your already making a name 4 urself. Cheers
well these new videos are gon be heckin great
Gwan Ciaran, great stuff
Would love to hear you on a podcast
comment
His videos are amazing, I can't wait to see the channel grow even more!
sonny notorious shagger! so funny man hahahahahahahahahahahaah
HELLO
Your content is such insane quality, can’t wait to see more!!
That previous video was sick and in my opinion your best work 👌
i'm rly excited to see how your channel progresses! honestly one of my faves, and you can clearly see how hard you work <3
Wow, the editing was never this good for an Willne reddit video
Looking forward to it
good luck!!
So happy for you Ciaran! Absolutely love your videos, editing style and humour.
Notifications On
Pouch... more like honey
Your videos are amazing, good luck
When Ciarán said he was leaving Will to focus on his own channel I was not expecting his videos to get this good.
Great vid
Best editor that was on that channel stilllll, represent and got your own back, love it.
Hey guys! this video was sponsored by hone no wait POUCH!!
I like the baby driver poster
Subscribe purely because of the outro ngl
Mia when her twitch career takes off
Sipping non-alcoholic Heineken on a throne is an alpha move
Sad
This guy doesn't need the money he's been voice acting for Moss in the IT crowd for years.
honestly Ciarans vids are quality
What about Kanye and Jeffrey?
6:15 he looks like an angel lol not gay tho
Been here since  like the first 5k and the growth is mental. Still so funny.
Pouch is just honey lol
What Netflix series is This?
Does anyone notice something wrong with his moustache? Its not even..
Your editing is off the charts..you'll smash it man
I really like this YouTuber! I think he would make a good editor
You should make a video about going to every Greggs in Zone 1 once this pandemic is over!
Ciaran is really good and cool
My favourite videos are you swinging you glorious basterd
i expect oddly satisfying videos still
Putting the YOU in youtube, I like it. I would love to see a full scale mockumentary of some kind, there needs to be a really good youtube one and I think you have the skill to do it.
I appreciate the amount of effort that you put into your videos. Can't wait to see more of this. Possibly my favourite channel right now :)
Is it just me or does he look like jesus? 6:33
Pouch is the same thing as honey but honey is popular
this guy is the goat of youtube
This was liiit
You are definitely one of the best youtubers going rn, can't many people who are better. Goated!
Boys remember, like the video for the YouTube algorithm!
Very excited to see what you have in store now.
Can't believe you 2 broke up 😭😭 well if it's what's good for the 2 of you I wish you both the best
THE QUALITY OF THESE VIDEOS IS ELITE

The introduction of the sponsor was brilliant XD
6:00 hes an angel man

i had to check i wasnt on netflix
I love your content, but Imo you’re the best supporting actor, just not male lead. Maybe female lead, but thats yet to be decided, when you outcome.
holy fuck, the amount of effort you put into this video is so apparent. incredible job, Ciarán. i genuinely hope that you succeed. you’re going to do great.
Do you like Charlie Brooker Ciaran?
I felt like I just experienced a Netflix documentary or a crime tv show , this is proper class and well done
s2w will never be the same 😔😔
Be honest, did you get inspiration for this video from the It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia episode called Making Dennis Reynolds a Murderer? I see huge similarities and I love it
Can’t wait for the sequel!
Man got sponsored by btec honey. Yay!
this is absolute class
i am impressed with the videos recently
Your stuff is great and the edits are top notch - keep it up big guy!
This is so big, I love it

Isn’t pouch just honey?
I haven't even watched a video yet and I know it's clickbate, please stop
this feels like a crime investigation show
Big boy ciarán standing on his own two feet
Absolute bloody legend!
this is probably the best video I’ve watched this year
i’m 100% here for this
Ciarán is always making great video like this incredible master piece. I loved it. I do like how he's using that throne and he's securing that bag. He's worked so hard to get here and I'm so proud.  Quick question, what do you use to edit and film?
Congrats ciarán! I wish you all the best!!❤️
love this so much
Pouch vs honey ohhh
0:24 🤣

Ayy
ooh such a smooth transition to the sponsorship I'm impressed
I'll hire you Ciaran
Pog
fun fact: you haven’t watched the full video
Finally... been waiting on Ciarán’s side of this story... so much drama, so many emotions...
Didnt even know you left will
Kieran changed
the extra quality of these vids now that you've left will is frankly disgusting. it gets me too excited
Jeez if every crime show opened like this video then I would be invested
On your intro alll the people had a thing in common , wife is DEAD, Ciarén was Will your wife?
POOOOG
Honestly the most heart wrenching breakup I've seen, I hope the divorce papers weren't a struggle Ciaran

Great vid
