Just epic !
Hello my dear YouTuber Mark Rober,🎉🎉🎉 I worked all my life in a mine underground, in parallel I worked in a taxi, assembled furniture, and felled trees of any complexity - if such people called me, but now I am in France, and I would really like to become at least a small YouTuber, but I do not know where to start, dear Mark❤❤❤,  please advise me how to start my own business and be needed by the world and people? I really want to but I do not know how
guys idk if i should put this on my project the part where he says he wrote this on chatgpt 💀
You probably won’t read this, but year ago from today I was at a low point in my life. Girlfriend dumped me, got fired from a job I loved, and had to get a job that made me miserable.   I watched this video after a long day of work feeling miserable and anxious about my future. After finishing this video that very moment I applied to a college that had a transfer program to get my bachelors in mechanical engineering.   I finished my first year of college 2 weeks ago passing my classes with B’s (I always sucked at school and passed only because my teachers wanted me gone.) thank you for giving me the confidence to believe in myself Mark.
I am Superman
nice
Well done chat gpt 🔥

Congratulations on this honor! The MIT commencement speech must have been inspiring. What key message did you hope to leave with the graduates?
Confused pets..??😅😅
That was moving and I'm in the legal field! Lol
I have always been wanting to go to MIT. This speech is very motivational for me😁
Мы похожи с Марком, я тоже неуверен на публике

Fui aceito recentemente em engenharia mecânica na UFPB,uma das pessoas que me fizeram escolher esse curso foi o Mark Robber.
I've been to a lot of commencement speeches. I've even given one. But this one is hands down the best speech I've heard. Congratulations Mark and all the 2023 MIT graduates.

Great speech and the amount of awkward silence made my day I still can’t stop laughing
Matthew 18:3 (KJV) reads: "And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven."  3. E disse: “Com toda a certeza vos afirmo que, se não vos converterdes e não vos tornardes como crianças, de modo algum entrareis no Reino dos céus. (Mateus, 18)
So ridiculous
Discours enrichissant, et instructif, Thank you Mark  Un peu marrant😅

Great speech.
“Mark Rober: it will get harder to make friends like you did at school” Me: how can it get any harder? I already don’t have any friends.
18:14-19:14
Wear are you from
Love this speech so much… I gave the commencement speech at my high school graduation this past June and wish mine could have been even half as cool as this one is
I just thought, that's a lot of money invested per person in this place. Eu apenas pensei, é muito dinheiro investido por pessoa neste lugar.

Do y’all keep rewatching this time to time, or am I weird...?

Glad to see Mark Rober in my hometown of Boston
This is a better speech than when my brother's principal started saying brain rot at his graduation
Can anyone explain why some videos are in Russian and some in English?🤯
at the very beginning the delivery was kinda robotic but it quickly picked up and that end was fire
Thank you, Mark!

Why You Upload In Hindi .....🙄🙄🙄
Pour moi c'est sa meilleure vidéo elle m'a marqué même un an plus tard
Excellent speech! I am watching from Saudi Arabia. It always impresses me how people give unwritten, sensible, and coherent speeches for 20 minutes or more. You must be brilliant to do that.

Loved it bro :)
진짜 미쳤다
A vida é sobre inspirar uns aos outros! Parece que você está indo muito bem! Parabéns.
Thanks Mark, you did some awesomeness in this speech.  Owesome#1 (7:28) : ... and the willingness to jump from my current SAFE rock to the next is what i feel has led me from college to NASA, to YouTube to eventually landing on this rock and giving the commencement speech at M-I- freaking-T! Owesome#2 (7:45) : ... There's no way i could have predicted that path when i was exactly in your shoes 20 years ago. "So cross your river one rock at a time, be do it with a naive optimism that it's all going to work out. Let that be your North Star!" (Mark Rober, 2024)  MANTEP beneer!!! NANCEP beneer!!!

ironic that he’s scared of speaking in front of a couple thousand people. When he speaks to millions through his videos.

What a pity to have a tech leader bashing someone who has achieved more in engineering than not only himself but than 99.9% of other people. Both Elon and Mark are inspiring the next generation of Tech, Mark with fun videos and Elon by leading technical innovation more than most.
Your presence greatly helps the world. Thank you for intention.❤
Very motivating and inspiring speech given by you 👍❤😊
No way he put on his background music irl hahah

so if MIT has a property damages do they give it to their students as a group project or sm ?
I imagine the person who came after Mark like "now how do I impress the public?" lol
I always get lazy to watch Mark's 20 minute video but whenever I click on it,, mennn I wonder how short that was! because of every content flow per second.

Unless Elon buys it😂😂😂😂😂 usually Brandon Farris is the one who makes me laugh, but I guess my favorite engineer could do it to.
!Wow what a speech
I would have a heat stroke from sitting there for 20 min in the 95 degree heat 😂
Just watched this 03MAR24, bing watching Mark Rober, and a lot of this applies not just to MIT graduates or engineers, but to everyone! So I started taking notes! 😂😂
I know that everything you said in your speech was created from the journey of experience you have taken so far.  "EFFORT WILL NOT BETRAY THE RESULTS".
Terima kasih mark , pidato anda membuat pikiran saya terbuka tentang perjalanan hidup , dengan cara yang berbeda , Sangat mengagumkan MARK ,  SALAM DARI INDONESIA MARK PENONTON SETIAMU (ARGA) ❤️
Марк спросил: "Почему бы человеку, который пересекает реку, не построить через неё мост?" Потому что он пересекает её впервый раз. Человек, который строит мост, уже пересекал эту реку.

Чел гений... Выйти и начать нести херню. Я думал он реально крут
i think this is the best speed speech create by chat gpt ,but the attitude of Mark Rober was awesome ,i really the this type of speech because i was also nervous when i give speech in class room.
1. 순진한 낙관주의 ㅡ 삶이 harsh하기때문에 부정적인것들 아예모르고 가는게 더 나을수있다 그냥 낙관적으로 가보는거  2. 삶. 실수실패를 게임같이보기  ㅡ 긍정적생각하고 포기하지말라와 다르다, 억지로 하기싫은거 참아가며 하는게 never give up이라면 겜처럼 생각하는건 실패같은게 오히려 있어서 더 재밌고 한다는 그런뜻   3. 사람과 관계를 유지하고 발전시키기 ㅡ 확증편향을 이런 긍정적 관계에 쓰는건 좋다 인간이원래는 착하다고믿는다든지  4. 가끔 장난스러운 반항하기

सुनो सुनो सुनो... मैंने यह वीडियो शुरू किया तो मुझे लगा हिंदी में है लेकिन पता चला कि ये तो डब किया गया है.... फिर सैटिंग पर क्लिक करके देखा तो पता चला कि नया फिचर आया है हर भाषा में देख सकते हैं,,,, सच में शानदार फीचर 😊😊❤

Is this the best speech I've ever heard? And I still think that you wrote your brilliant speech yourself, without the help of chat GPT.
funny, but I stopped watching it after Elon joke. Sadly.
Про наивный оптимизм очень тронул, потому что именно сейчас в моей жизни протекает этот период.  Спасибо тебе и удачи во всём

Gracias, por ayudarme a creer. 😊
*Introducing the #1 killer of "Naive Optimism" in the work place:* F R A G I L E - E G O E D E G O T I S T I C A L S E L F I S H B O O M E R  M A N A G E R S  It's not about having Naive Optimism, Mark.  It's about how to deal with those around you who are antithetic to your belief.
Foster relationships — use confirmation bias positively, frame failures positively, have some naive optimism. Great speech!
GREATEST SPEECH EVER.🤗👊

Estoy cerca de presentar un examen para entrar a la Universidad, pero desde hace tiempo que estoy agobiada por ello y simplemente llegaba a un punto en el que pensaba no lo voy a lograr, como voy a entrar a una de esas increíbles universidades, pero este vídeo me hizo reflexionar así que voy a esforzarme más ya que siento que no lo he hecho y aprender de mis errores. FANTÁSTICO DISCURSO
Mi hijo, Ángel Peñalva de 7 años es fan de Mark Rober  y sueña con conocerlo en vivo y dice que quiere ser como él.
😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
Perfecto brother 👌
MSU vs MIPT vs MIT
I'm from Vietnam, this is the first time I've heard a speech from MIT, you're very engaging, and I like the way you talk, you motivate me, thank you for that.

What a great speech, it really touched my emotions. Although I don't know how much AI contributed to this speech, I want to say,... your speech is worthy of being a masterpiece.
После этого видео сразу захотелось подтягиваться и отжиматься 134567 раз в секунду, выучить все языки миру, стать самым сильным и успешным человеков в мире и полететь на марс!!!!
Предвзятость может вогнать в глубокие иллюзии, поэтому надо имеет скорее равновесные отношение , когда в мир видет в разных цветах , а не только в белом и черном. По крайней мере такая моя философия.
If *Jacques Fresco* had performed there, it would have been much better. I'm sorry, Mark Rober.

Thank you, Mark Rober
Not an engineer nor MIT grad by any means but I absolutely needed this. I've been late diagnosed ADHD and realized how much it affected my life when i sat there among my 40 tabs open and saw all the stuff I abandoned for what felt like the first time, some that were sitting there for a year because I wanted it - but not bad enough to cross the river. I cleared my tabs. I'm gonna take what I love and go back to it. Thank you.
That speech was amazing!!!!!

너무 멋집니다!! 당신의 영상을 보며 큰 도전과 영감을 받아갑니다. ~
big big respect <3 amazing speech iam 38 and i learned from your words! thanks <3

What a wonderful speech Mark👏👏👏
This was AWESOME!!!
4:31 Mark practically owns this song
mamba mentality + engineering = Mark Rober
This is probably the only speech I'd sit through and listen to completely
See u guys in June 2053 ~
Mark: I don’t understand the computer puzzle and points system. You said the people who worked harder didn’t lose points so the ones who were penalised 5 points each time gave up. The message was that if you try but don’t get punished for failing then you just keep trying but that’s not real life.
If Mario was just jumping over 1 pit no one would play it? Guess u don’t remember flappy bird advertisements and 1 goal going into 1 pit lol

Were you serious about the speed to 2053?
You are the second smartest YouTuber in the world
MrBeast did a video and he said you want to very awesome he didn’t think you were smart
I love that Mark said monthly videos then takes 4 months for his next vid
He seemed very nervous
Eu sou Brasileiro
no way he said subscibers then the subscribew button gave a hit on where it is, mark you clever geneus
I’m coming back for the 2053 video mark I will be there
I am in 6th grade and your speech inspired me to do better in school

Great job Mark you have done great, and you are one of the best YouTubers in my mind, you are hilarious, you at caring and abnormally smart in engineering

Mark sos un mentiroso y lo español??'

My dad had a seizure here…
This is great advise for anyone really not just people from MIT!
"That's  not a bug. That's a feature!"
Wow
Este no esta en español?
Advice....
MIT took so much money from Epstein should've mentioned that
Awesome!!
What a amazing and wonderful speech
No está en español me mintió
The only thing I reget at my high school graduation was loosing my hat and instead taking someone else's when I threw it up. 😢
Español?

No iban a estar todos los videos en españo?
Hey mark you're smart until  speech i love this class of video
this is the best speech I've ever heard! It is a perfect example of how to structure any speech and deliver it. Mark, thank you! you're such an inspiration!
What a great speech. The principals he outlined can be applied to anyone's journey in life.
What happened to the voice track?

I live next to the MIT
wow
Porque seus videos nao estao todos em portugues ainda? Eu estou adorando seus conteudos...
You nailed it!
imagine if elon musk just comments under this video, 'consider buying youtube already done'
😢
HERE   - 10/6/23
i am only at primary school😅😅😂😂
14:18 one thing im getting for this third part of advice is that we should actively foster and create new relationships whether friend or lover
Dang I’m like the personification of the hault of progressive systems and ideas if your too afraid to attempt the risk of starting a business your entire existence can be absolutely ruined by a failed business venture
10:48 OMG I think make robber just said “learn from your mistakes but don’t focus on them” omg that’s all I do because how do u become perfect if you don’t eradicate your imperfections😊
5:22 niave optimism is (impossible) originally but definitely very hard to accomplish knowing all the work and obstacles makes me not attempt certain endeavors because how could I achieve greater things than any other normal person no one is special and everyone is special.
I love you Mark Rober ❤🎉😊
MARK my words I will be back in 2053
This was something everyone on earth should hear.
Wow what an inspiration.  Well done.
My dad was actually at the mit reunion at the same time (he went there) and my family was sooo excited Bc they thought he would see you lol (my entire family are huge fans)
Que tremendo ! me senti no dia da minha formatura de Ciências Da Computação aos 53 anos de idade em agosto de 2023.
Can SOMEONE explain the significance behind the 23 banner up front?
15:15 so real
I feel that how mark hates speaking in public
mark rober is arguably in the top 25 greatest people to live in the modern world and i mean that. this guy is inspiring people all over the globe, and brings happiness and new interests to many.
This speech was great! Well done, well done.
Ive sat through and watched a few commencement speeches but this was honestly the most empowering one. The advice isnt cheesy everyday advice but an actual tool for reaching your goals.
Most inspiring youtube video I've ever watched
hey mark im smart now
guys did u notice that when the music was playing he didn’t mess up but when it wasn’t playing he did, a lot? The music makes him way more calmer
As someone who aspires to get into MIT, I found this speech very inspiring. It's rare for someone to be able to enjoy a 20 minute speech. Thanks Mark!
Wow that was incredibly insightful and delivered as only you could have...as always amazed at your creativity and will to risk to grow....powerful!
Such a awesome speech!!!
Даже я,простой одиннадцатиклассник из России был вдохновлён речью Марка. Марк,спасибо за видео❤

Rip I’m only in middle school live close to there 😢
i know someone named kenneth chap who was here
there’s absolutely no way MIT, a high-class American engineering university, would ever let somebody do this.  Unless that person is Mark Rober.
"Until Elon buys it." That punch line made me spill out my coffee.
Anyone else going "wait, what?" at 19:17?
selfloathing at its finest
Mark should be president
I just finished university and this is the speech i need Thank you Mark
Yes
Hey can you do the piano and have it play rush e 2
wow
Awesome Speech!
“It’s not a bug, it’s a feature” He actually brought up the ultimate mojang excuse. 😂
“Monthly”
It wasn't speach ,it was pure comedy 🤣
Bro really added his own background music for his speech 🤣
my favourite part of this video is when mark spoke such facts his timelapse music started playing
Mark, since I just started college it's been a challenge and with this speech of yours it's made me realize no matter what happens in my career in college I will evolve and learn how to combat different challenges. Thank you so much.
Great speech Mark!!! Your mom would be proud ❤️
Объясните, почему есть видео на русском и на английском?
Go Mark Rober!!!! Amazing speech!!
bro just roasted elon 💀 💀 💀
Again. Awesome.
awesome speech! loved it!
That was a stellar speech, I love to hear advice from a person that has achived your level of sucess.

You did great!
i was in there LoooL
영상 제작자님 한글자막 감사합니다.
Mark for president!
Keeping it real ❤
Wanna know somthing cool. My uncle works here. He is somtging important idk what
Oh I loved it so much😂😂 If I was there I would have been a mess, laughing and slapping my knees with reckless abandon. This is truly a sterling commencement speech, the best of its kind.
Mark I have heard other commencement speeches before but they are usually read from notes; So besides the part of how awesome the speech was while listening to it I just find it amazing that you gave the entire speech from your heart and passion like you do with all your videos and work.
ааа, можно перевод на русский, пожалуйстаааа!)
This was one of the best speeches I’ve ever heard at a commencement ceremony and I have four kids so I have had to sit through a bunch. Kudos, truly. I hope that the students are not so overwhelmed by everything going on that they can’t take in what you said. It was clear, concise and catchy enough to remember. Great job!
Maquenãodenãodevocemora
I watched this again 2 months later and your words still resonate. Even though I am 70 years of age, there are still challenges in life that bring reward.  Great speech mate.
17:53 i thought for sure for a sec he was about to say "this is actually great opportunity to reveal the sponsor of todays video"
no hats were thrown
amazing speech ❤❤❤ thanks mark your the best. You have taught me hundreds of life skills. You are absolutely the best.
한국인으로서는 이해가 안되네요. 왜 남의 물건을 가져가죠?

I can't believe I get a Carlin reference in this.
Now *this* is a commencement speech
Your passionate speech and creative approach were really impressive. Your passion for science and innovation and the various experiments that show it have inspired me greatly. The story about the meaning of learning and growing through failure gave me great courage. Your story reminded me that failure is an important step in the path to success. I will apply what I have learned from you to life and move forward toward a better future. Thank you!
Through your speech , I can see father and not be afraid of my failures. Thank you. And I guess you were able to give this speech through failure. When was the most frustrating time in your life?
คุณกำลังสร้างความยากลำบากให้กับนักเรียนมัธยมปลาย POSCO ค่ะ
Phat Gus got a shout-out at the beginning.
student in class 2-8) -I was so impressed by your speech that I wrote a comment. The first of your advice, naive optimism, was most impressive. Your speech gave me the courage to live my future life. I reflected on myself in the past, which I only thought negatively, and based on naive optimism, I thought I should just trust myself and move forward. -I agree with your opinion, because if you don’t accept failure positively, you can keep thinking of failure and lose self-esteem. In addition, there were times when i felt like giving up because i had negative emotions and kept reminding me of failure. We should overcome this. Lastly, when we think positively of failure, we can develop into better people. We are so moved by your lecture. -Sometimes I think someone negatively at first and I couldn’t foster relationship with them because of confirmative bias. When I became a friend with them, I regretted thinking about that.Your advice made me try thinking someone positively, and I will try to foster positive relationships from now on. By the way, why aren’t you updating your youtube videos? Are you making something cool? I can’t wait. -We are currently learning this lecture in the class. We got impressed listening to your commencement speech. Especially your second advice. Framing the failure to actually move forward. Even though we weren’t there to listen to your speech, it was such a precious time learning your advices. -Hi Mark rober, Before I watch this video, I don't think why I should foster my relationships. BUT you changed my mind. And your mom must see you on the sky, and is satisfied with your massage, foster your relationships. I hope you continuing your great youtube video. And I enjoyed and it was funny when you joked! LOL
9:20 made an impact
Hey Rober! I'm pretty sure I that princess peach beat both you and Bowser Last night and like a 100 nights ago and like way before that too
I love your speech. Pls speak mine which will be in about 10 years and probably be in England.😂😂😂
Nice vid
can you give me some advive, i'am in class 5 and many people regret not doing something in thier childhood
That speech! I'm inspired to not let my fear of failure stop me from furthering my education!!! 🧑‍🎓
Как я понимаю русского перевода больше не будет?😢
spain spanish on your videos please
cgi=?
Great speech with a hint of humour! I 😍
nice speech mark
I went to mit for a tour a month ago

Yo, i have a question can i use your references for my speech i dont wanna plagiarize or copy you without telling you.
Love you Mark! How can a speech have soo much influence!
NEVER BACK DOWN, NEVER WHAT??? 11:22
Hey Everyone! I would really like to have my Master's Degree in Electrical Engineering from MIT. How can I go about it as an International student
Drone pilots are the only ones not impressed by this :)
Mark can I be in a video
I genuinely hate commencement speeches but this is TRULY AN EXCEPTIONAL SPEECH!! I hope you continue to take speaking engagements & challenge yourself to get better. Cheers
What a beautiful speech. I was also laughing all the time.
Dude just Planed for a video 30 years from now😰
Well I am gonna save it for some real motivation the starting part 〽️ ....   I ain't one of those graduated folks but it helped me a lot .... thank you Mark
I guess these words are what I needed to listen today
Dude! I follow all of your videos! Keep it up!!
The only way youtube exists in 30 years is if Elon buys it and frees it from liberalism
I love the humour you used. What an amazing speech Mark
Ah naive optimism. Something I never had even as a child.
What an speech!
He sways a lot.
well that took a while
this guy is the reason l will go to M.I.T. and nasa
if Elon bought YouTube I'd be fine either way lol
dude became jake peralta @ 8:20
Finally, a graduation speech worth listening to
This speech was the perfect combination of inspiring and funny and I absolutely loved it! I wish that I was in that audience.
Sorry,
I’m do you how did you do that?
Amazing speech Mark! Such great advise and wisdom and the delivery was perfect. It was real and heartfelt and most importantly it was YOU. Congratulations 🍾🎈🎉🎊
i just listened every words every gestures that you delivered. I have never ever seen such speech with the synchronization of such a convincing words and that level of confidence. Really loved it.
Who skipped like half the video 👇
Terrific speech. The proof is that I didn't look out the window to daydream even one time. Kudos!
Yup... fall down 7x, get up 8
Incredible speech! Your metaphors really helped me understand my childlike actions I've made when I was smaller. Not only that, the three life advices you gave at the ceremoney will also be very helpful in the future. Thank you very much! :)
Do you know mrbeast
Y los vídeos de mark Robert en español?😭
Ps, if you don’t like public speaking, tell that to the 24 million subscribers who watch you do it
A cool speech... full of sincerity and integrity... well done! o7
Love it so inspirational ❤

You did an awesome job.

Even if the viewers who listened to your speech on youtube or whatever platform were not the main target of the said speech, it has motivated and inspired most and hopefully all of us even those with a dark outlook on life.
GREAT speech and you are a very charismatic speaker!
Cool CGI
Okay this is the speech i wish i heard at *my* 2023 graduation. Better late than never!
Mark is The Guy that you will say make cheese land on the moon and he will achieve it.
How come you didn’t give me a puzzle
Oh and great speech

Awesome speech.  Great job.
I liked your speech because it was a closeup and im at home
Bro played the theme in real life, im dead😂
Great speech. As I was watching I remembered my day of graduation and imagined you as our speaker and I got goosebumps with that thought. Thank you for this inspiring message.
👍
I'm going to comment here again in 30 years, let's see what changed
Rober's speech is inspiring and motivating. It is a reminder that anything is possible if you set your mind to it.
Cool dude 👍
im sure all the grasshoppers, birds, ants, and plants got motivated a few miles arround.
You are the best.
You need to do a colab with Joe Barnard and BPS Space!

OMG!I CANT BELIEVE I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT YOU THE OTHER DAY MARK! seriously.I was talking to my sisters wondering how you HAVE Been.Get in touch with me.I know you have to remember me it's Andrea Godlevsky,I went to the same church with you growing up,I was always at your house with your mom.the Fullerton ward!
Darn. Now I have to wait 30 years.
I was tearing before the first advice
Literally zip-tying a fpv-drone to the hat.. many engineering indeed
I was waiting for him to stop the speech and say something like, “this speech is sponsored by Shopify”
Amazing Speech Mark I loved it! As someone currently in college this really hit me and it was very inspirational.
why am I crying??? 😢
noice
This was a fantastic speech, it really resonated with me and I gotta say it did may me teary eyed
The music was the cherry on top
Nice 👍
Mark: You, an experienced engineer who drew inspiration from your Mom's life experience and encouragement, have now received a standing O from some of our best future engineers; and that is the cherry on top. Congratulations, Class of 23, and this retired engineer can confirm that Mr. Rober's three points will enhance your life.
Naive optimism, Bias Confirmation, and Relationships got it.
The likelyhood of Mark seeing this is slim to non. But I fail at school a lot. I have ADHD I have never had the best grades in undergrad and it feels like I'm never going to graduate, but then I randomly come across one of Mark's videos and I'm reminded failure is part of success and I keep going. I'm going to be a software engineer one day even if every class is brutal out of the set up of school and not the content itself I can't wait to message mark one day and say I did it
What a great speech! Thank you.
You robbed all of their hearts. Nailed it Mark
Usually i in to watching mark inventing things ... Got say .. had my full attention with his words
Friggin RAD, dude!!!! 🔥🔥🔥
Thank you so much Mark. This video helped me see the world in such a better light. The phrases about your mom got to my heart too, and that speaks volumes of your impact in the world. Thank you, thank you, thank you!
Looking forward to that update in 30 years. That will be wild to look back and remember that I watched this video.
Its really inspiring to hear this ins speech in a graduation ceremony. But it saddens me that might not go to school this year or next year or maybe the following years to finish my remaining 1yesr in college. But i think i would be fine... i will be fine...
Just awesome🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Listening to your speech was the most fun part of my day!!!
Mark is ganna be the definition of Flying Cars 🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌
I didn’t graduate college but now I’m ready to cross my river of life thank you mark
“How many all nighters, and cans of Red Bull” had me dying
Mark, this was one of the best speeches I have ever heard in my lifetime. The majestic ending sent shock waves through my heart. Thank you for this gem
_I get above-average nervous during public speeches_  *Masters it like a baus*
This guy is great I remember the first squirrel maze 😂
that was the best speech i have ever heard in my entire life.
You are truly amaing!!!!!!
really love the speech and your energy although the drone part would've been way cooler 15 years ago... jk xD
This inspired me to do more art  (Im being serious)
Life isn't a river it's a box of chocolate you never know what you're going to get
This is so cool, me and my older brother have been watching you since the pandemic. My brother’s dream school is MIT and I think your speech really encouraged him! Also we think all your videos are awesome and my favorite videos are the squirrel obstacle courses.❤hope you keep making amazing content for years to come.😊
I love your videos, Mark. But, the fact that you quoted George Carlin during a commencement speech at MIT is EPIC!!! Consider me not just a fan, but a SUPERFAN!
If something happens to Mark everyone that graduated this needs to make his video. Please promise each other that. We never know where that river will take us but that stone (video) is where you will be with or without Mark! (He will be there though)
Love it that you break rule, and traditions! I love your speech. Congrats all MIT grads!
The videos would be so boring if it wasn't for the music, it really changed the vid, no saying jt should be on the whole vid
"Without further ado I give you me" best line ever🤣🤣
W o w
Epic speech
Bro had a background song irl 😂😂
i cant wait to watch a update video in 2053
This was such a great commencement speech. I'm so glad you addressed reframing. Overall, you gave them three of the most important concepts that they can apply for the rest of their lives. This SHOULD be a TED Talk. You were big before. This is going to make you HUGE.
That was massive Mark🤟
Hi Mark; that was a very playful yet the most beautiful commencement speech I've heard. I'll be getting my degree in 4 weeks so the information was super relatable. I'm so grateful to have stumbled on your youtube channel and this is exactly what I needed to hear.  Cheers and lets change the world while maintaining that level of humour💜.
Mark, that speech was amazing and I am so grateful as a non MIT grad, I was still able to learn and be inspired by you! I will definitely be using your advice! Thank you <3 Stay Amazing!
Now imagine if that hat flew back to your head . Impressive
I loved your speech, I cried, I laughed, I enjoyed it a lot, as a future Bioengineer here I am overcoming the rocks of the career of life. I send you a big hug from Argentina!!
I wanna become an engineer like you❤
congratulations for that :)
Change your frickin' water bottles. I hate those.
Hallo Mark slebeww
Huge respect for you
Goosebumps With the Music 🎀
Mark i dream to become a doctor AND u inspire me
很喜欢的YouTuber，然后Mark从MIT毕业了，这可以是荣誉博士后了吧，那么多设计， 那么多创造，跟Elon很像的一点就是发现社会的漏洞 然后去改进，去修补 去填补。厉害
We need teachers like you
This is the first time I see Mark in front of MIT speech and also this is also the first time I hundred percent gives attention even though in my previous college or University have this same kind of speech but I kinda not really listening or watching it properly because maybe I just lazy so yeah you make me watch from the beginning until the end and that's quite mesmerising and at the same times truly inspirational.
Mark, I absolutley loved your presentation!
Can you build a Antikythera Mechanism
Bro this video was projected in my school assembly
Genuine lol with the Elon joke
Wow❤👌😌
I need to mention something You're afraid of public speaking but you speak in front of millions and people on YouTube
The speech looked harder than the drone lol
So humble 💖 great speech
Wooooow congratulations Mark you are the best inventor 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
i swar u
This really changed my way of thinking, wish I heard it 5 years ago.
david bowie heroes
Me taking notes from him for my graduation speech
This is Awesome.
Great job Mark and who knows maybe another door has opened, Because you really could make inspiring speeches your other thing...
4:31 the explanation bg music to him is what Subway Surfers is to most of us with a short attention span lmao
I rather have Randall Park give the speech than seeing a flying drone.
looking at the stats - the views on all Marks other videos are 10million+ , this one is 3 mil. Guess people dont care that much about other people's graduations 😂 👩🏼‍🎓👨‍🎓
Great vid 👍
ㅤ:]
Not from MIT but class of 2023 👋🎉❤️
this is the best motivational speech ever   I wanted to cry hearing it
The Kanye slander 🤣. This has to be the best commencement speech I've ever heard. Thank you Mark!
for those who were wondering hes a BYU graduate and had a masterals in USC acc to google.
What if mark and hack Smith   did a collaboration
20 min of this dude yappin 🤦‍♂️
That is motivation!
MARK THE GOATEST OF ALL TIME🐐
this is a truley amazing moment
15:12  bro really called out Kanye😂😂😂
As someone who graduated 2 years ago... I think this is the best advise I've ever heard and from the prospective of my early career I completely agree.
Mark looks so imbarested
That’s the same place from sinior year
Simply AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
What an incredible speech, I love it. 👏
No way you get more nervous than the average person. No voice shaking or word stumbling at all
Mark being Mark
Best graduation speech from someone who is not trying hard to be an academic and motivational speaker. Love the very youthful vibe. I’m just wondering if the kids 30 years from now will still understand the references made. Hahaha. Cheers!
Lose five points for your hat not taking off directly from your head.
The comments on your videos are always nothing but positivity.  I absolute adore this.  You are a genuine and amazing person.
Beautiful speech.
Top 1 graduation speeches.
Hey Mark I thought the cap would automatically sit on your head.🤠
Cant wait till 2053 🗣️
very inspirational.😎
Hey Mark! I am just an 8th grader who just happens to be your no. 846th fan. (I'm pretty sure all the other 845 spots were already taken), Even before I saw this video, I always loved tech and wanted to go to MIT. You have truly inspired me.
I was there for my oldest brother’s graduation, and I unfortunately MISSED THE CAP FLYING BY THE DRONE THINGY BECAUSE I WAS IN THE INFIRMARY BECAUSE MY NOSE STARTED BLEEDING 💀. the speech was cool though, I learned some tips
"relived parents" LOL. I hope to be there one day.
Somehow people are giving him hat because the hat wasn’t impressive enough?!?!? The people that are hating on this for this reason is making me lose hope in humanity.
Fvcking MIT.  OK, I can replace a congressman with a kiosk. The doners and the lobbyists need only to line up and swipe their cards. The "congressman's" algorithm will shift accordingly.   MIT, I double-dog dare you to replace congressman.   ... you lot of fools.
1. naive optimism- pick something and just take the leap of faith, let curiosity and passion lead you as well as what the world needs, obsessively study it. 2. frame your failures- learn from don't be focused on the failures, risk is usually linear with reward. 3. foster your relationships- leverage confirmation biase to your relationships, like saying I am lucky to have these people in my life. 4. engage in occasional playful anarchy (LOL)
Awesome.
Impressive Speech. Truly Inspiring!
Youtube would be SO MUCH BETTER if Elon Musk bought it. - Facts.
bro pulled out the background music💀
BEST SPEECH EVER 😂
lost of acward moments : _
Dude idk how you don't like public speaking 😂. no one could of said that speech better your and awesome public speaker.
yo
Great speech
Graduating from MIT, wanting to be an engineer or wanting completely different goals in life all together, your speech can be applied to it anyone’s goals in life and  that I think is a testament to how great the speech was and just how vital those “three” points can be to anyone’s and everyone’s lives.  Thank you.   (Or do we thank chat gpt 😂?)
YOU ARE THE BESTTTTTTTT
YOU ARE THE BESTTTTTTTT
The last part was great. Fostering relationships i struggled with assuming the worst in everyone and trying to overcome it, it can really taint your mood
I’m gonna take note of this speech for when I have to do my speech for a class I’m gonna be in in high school👍
Amazing speech 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Great speech!  Thx&see ya😁
Mark you are better than me at speeches
Props to the school(s) who recognize talent is talent, no matter the shape or origin.  But it does help if the words are coming from a former NASA engineer...
This is probably the best speech I've watched in a while
Could not love this more❤️
You're probably not going to see this Mark, but I'm going around to different creators and asking if they could make the perfect mousetrap car that can go forward and back and stop at the exact same place in the least amount of time possible, or even just make a mousetrap car that can go a certain distance and control on the dot in the least amount of time possible for a short or even a video. I know it's a lot to ask, but I want this because I'm entered into a competition called TSA. It's like Science Olympiad but may be less well-known. Our prompt is to make the mousetrap travel 19 feet exactly and stop in the least amount of time possible with a singular mousetrap. The distance is measured in cm from the point at which the car first crossed the start line to the finish line. I've gotten it down to 3 seconds and <1cm from the line and I feel like I hit a dead end, I can't figure out how to improve it anymore, I tried to put the braking system on the back wheels but it wouldn't go straight with my PLA flexing all over the place, I looked at Rigid X CF Filled PETG filament, but it wouldn't ship soon enough for my deadline. I'm hoping that you might be able to get the time to around 2 seconds with your resources, I really want to know that innovation is still possible and that I still have room to improve. Your mousetrap video inspired me to enter this competition, and I thank you so much for lighting the spark within me, showing me a path to a future that I think I'll enjoy. Thank you, Mark.
really great speech but Bake in the toilet pardon?
Thank you, Mark. This was phenomenal beyond measure and truly inspiring.
Mark Rober is awesome. Thanks Mark's mom for raising someone able to use his knowledge to make the world a better place 🙏
Amazing.  Your brilliance paired with your humour is stunning.  Great job.
thanks from Italy
He is like the engineering sicnece teacher we aloes wanted
"it's not a bug, it's a feature"  I can't believe he actually said that 😂
I will apply this speech to my life.
My son is 9 and loves Scratch Thank you MIT
when he played the iconic music it was amazing well done mark you've come so far
👏👏👏👏👏👏
$1.99Thank you Mark for this awesome speech!. awesome speech! loved it!.
conzimed @7:24, and the willing to jump from my, willingness to jump - dronkie $
is there a link to the transcript?
Mark, keep your promise please.
Thank you thank you
4:35 the best thing in the speech bravo
Haha 95 degrees Fahrenheit, that’s cute.
Never disappoints!
I feel like he was sad no one threw there hat
Duuuuuuuude :0 That was *awesome* I wanna get a inspirational speech from Mark Rober irl while i graduate XD
That was FANTASTIC. Great advice and one heck of a fun ending. You were rock solid and your presentation was spot on. Congrats
A bit long but nicely done
WOW. That was the best speech ive ever heard. Thank you Mark! :)
Just wanted to say I watched this video when it was released so thirty years from now I can confirm that I did
$1.99Thank you Mark for this awesome speech!. awesome speech! loved it!.
awesome speech! loved it!.  $1.99Thank you Mark for this awesome speech!.
BEST COMMENCEMENT SPEECH IVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE!!! Definitely resonant!!
Wow...
I am so glad that I came across your channel, Mark. I have learned a lot from you, including how to go about engineering a solution to a problem in a systematic way, how to create videos like you do, and even how to deal with big setbacks in a project. Thank you.
cant wait
I waited till the end for that
complete win
mark i started high school this year and know this speech was not aimed directly at me but i have still taken a lot away from this
I've honestly watch this video 3x already. Love the speech!
Public speaking is so much easier when the public part is seperated from you by a camera. So much so that millions is less stressful than hundreds when the first is on the internet.
Love the speech
I think your 4 pieces of advice will finally help me become successful and I don't even have a college degree, thank you so much.
Fearless prediction: 47.3 percent of all graduation speeches in 2024 will have musical accompaniment.
Mark, your mom is beyond proud of you.
When he started saying his 4th piece of advice I thought I was going crazy because of the barely hearable music until I remembered he was playing music from the start
Keep the politics out of it yo.
The music is crazy
bros so inspiring
Class of '23 is DEFINITELY NOT the first graduating class to persevere through a pandemic sorry but yall can get fucked
Makes me wanna go back to school and become an engineer lol
I wish we had this promotion speech 😂
I am exactly 19 hours away to get to know my result of high school and know if I passed. But your speech kinda dimmed down my stress level as for now, will not think it's the end of the world if I don't make it on the first lap, and I can still jump on other rocks to cross that river ^^
He becomes a professional public speaker when the music plays
Best commencement speech ever! They are so lucky.
LOL "putting yourself out there."  Anyone graduating now is going to witness 60 years of the end of global capitalism as climate change dismantles the world supply chains and billions of people migrate due to floods, fires, and famine. I'm assuming MIT grads will be on the forefront of trying to cope with systemic industrial failures.   Chris Hedges pointed out how trite commencement speeches are.
you look like murr with hair
Relatable piece of advice you gave me mark , FOREVER THANKFUL , YOU CLEARED ALL MY Doubts AND FEAR IN MY MIND ALWAYS GONNA LOOK UP TO THIS VIDEO WHEN I GO FOR HIGHER STUDIES ❤❤❤❤❤❤
You could tell you were nervous but imo it made it so much better and relatable. 💜
I am not MIT. I am a highschooler on another continent. But i was motivated. Thank you Mark, I know what i must do to achieve my dreams. Trully, you have succeeded in inspiring the young. Godspeed
I may not be planning on going to mit but i do plan on going to UTI, and when i do get thise skills to work on cars i kinda want to try to build my own hypercar, dont know if ill have the money but hopefully ill be making a gokd bit of money
AMAZING, Mark! Congrats to you and the grads!!
8:16 he’s talking to real civil engineer on yt
ur talking to a group of student who have the potential to change the world
Wow
mark that was epic
That marimba goes HARD
1:22 He has enough shades for everyone 😎
Clearly, I've reached a PhD level in 'ChatGPTology.' I've been using it so much, I can spot its usage a mile away. The moment Mark started his speech, I was like 'Aha! This smells of AI mischief.
Hey Mark, I was the student you pushed down the stairs by "accident". Just wanted to say that my lawyers are going to be in contact
can I just say I think the most inspirational part of this for me is listening to you mess up words the same way I do all the time and just keep going. Thank you so much for not being perfect.
nice😌
Is this a speech or a comedy show?
Life goals 💯 thank you for your inspiration ❤
Ha! Geroge Carlin was the best!!
Mark, with planet are you come from? You go with a suit, the robe of Hogwarts, the hat of a swimmer, tray on the head and headband like a cherry on a cake. World Peace to you too...
Hey Mark I love your videos and I think that you're the best person ever. By the way great speech.
Well done Mark! I’ve never intentionally listened to a commencement speech until now.
"what motivated you to design the first venus sky colony?" "i wanted to be in a mark rober video"
Wow!!! Loved it!!!!
It wouldn't be a Mark Rober video without a flex. Always entertaining and informative, congrats on your success and growth and can't wait to see what the future holds.
Im not graduating from MIT (or graduating at all yet) but this advice in the speech does helps a lot😅😅😅
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
No comment 👏👏👏👏👏👏
Ooohhh that Kanye dig 😂
Awesome speech/presentation.  I’m sure the graduates, staff, and attendees were impressed.   We can only hope they will take to heart your words and help build a better world.
Lol, I was there for my brother's graduation
Hey just got the phat Gus plush, and it came with the nipples…. What the heck Mark???
Mark thinks people will know who elon is in 30 years because he’s gonna be a robot.
What an epic commencement speech. The best I've ever seen. Well done Mark.
Unless Elon buys it. 😂 I’m dying 😂
I wish you had spoke at my commencement 45 years ago. I have gone with Blind Faith and made many mistakes and enjoyed all the problems but that's what makes engineering great please continue I follow your Channel regularly and enjoy it
IIT is a better engineering school
When you started the music, it sounded much more like a Mark Rober video.
wait wat..... did you say that the kids will explain at dinner cuz I will not explain it-_-
The first time I'm hearing about MIT but this speech made me feel the need to be there 😢❤🎉
Now this.... This is 🎉 how to graudate in style.      Faulk600❤
Did Mark hold a PhD degree? Anyone knows?
You are EPIC!
You're a great inspiration! What a great speech and video!
Hi Mark! I have always wondered, are you a aerospace engineer or mechatronics?
On July 6 it’s my brothers birthday
At first I though u would say u were using a mechian that's speaking and ur just mouthing it
Mark Roger I love ur video best best best video
The Kanye diss is crazy lol
I am not MI freaking T student and never will be but thank you for your precious advice, specially n° 3.
Phantastische Rede, an so einem ehrwürdigen Ort wie dem MIT!  Gut gemacht, Mark!
Best graduation speech I’ve ever heard, literally!
I can graduate out of college after getting an apartment.
You are my hero
"I made a robot that can play lato-lato forever" next please :)))))))
i cringed so hard bro
why can't all our school speeches be like this
best engineering college in the world?? *scoff *scoff ITT *scoff *scoff
These are some of the smartest engineering and scientists in the world sitting in that crowd.
I'm actually graduating from my Master's in Mechanical Engineering this year and your speech fully resonates with me Mark. Regardless of my different academic institute, I'm going to take on everything you've said as I prepare to take on the challenges of the real world. Cheers mate!!
the mario reference was perfect...truly perfect
My mom actually works at MIT, she didn’t come though because it was very crowded
I thought It's Imran hashmi 😴
17:50 "You know what, time out,  this is actually a great opportunity to talk about the sponsor of this video"
double-u speech.
Effective speech❤
this is a great speech! u really related to the students.
I love this speech and you should make a video of how you memorize the speech.  And if you do please give me a shout out.
If I am a kid or an adult this speech is so inspiring!  Congratulations 🎊
THIS is how you make a speech not boring.
Love your content and your way of thinking keep being you.
Nice Speech Mark
What a guy!! What a speech! 🙌🙌🙌
Mark, how hard would it be to try and make baymax in real life 🤔
boring....
Bro this could be a motivational podcast
Wow!  Awesome speech!
you were great <3
Best speech I have ever heard. Thank you for every single word of that.
Amazing. I was kinda smiling & laughing a bit here & there, but when the intro music kicked in, I was all smiles. It’s one of my favorites.
Duh
amazing speech!!!! I learned about confirmation bypass today! thank you!
My kids are laughing at me because I cried at this. Thank you for this moment of confirmation bias.
MAKE A BAIT BIKE FILLED WITH CEMENT OR LEAD. A 213LB BIKE😂😂
<3
mark is the only person who uploads a video with 3.4 million views with no description
I learned a lot from this comment, and I think these three things will be very useful in my life
😬
Mark can you ask you can talk at the gorgea at the high school in the 2030 gradgratio
Noice😂
WHATS THAT SONG CALLED AT 5:09
I bet you could stop the forest fires
Elon buying Youtube would be the only guarantee it lasting 30 more years.
Peaches, peaches, peaches, peaches, peaches… I Luhlove yoooooooh!
Love your videos
I actually didn't fall asleep
why do his eyebrows look drawn on
When I grow up, I want to be Mark Rober.
Mark, my words I’ll come back this to this video in the future this comment will make history as the greatest comments of all time mark rover has in chief many great things in life don’t be afraid to go ahead, and life becomes an even greater than yourself.
I didn't get the dig at Elon
very cool
We all know what Sheldon says about MIT….
We get like 3 videos a year. Hate to be this guy but this is not the content  i want. But congratulations non the less
This is better than any stand-up comedy
awesome speech!
This speech is making me laugh. Even though it may be written by ChatGPT or whatever. This has got to be the best Commencement Speech ive ever heard
Let's go Mark! You're making the world brighter EVERY DAY. : D
Just about ZERO of what he said was true. Couldn't get past 2 minutes and 50 seconds. Are all of you people blind? Do you know really know who this guy is?
🫡
I am a student and this was amazing
Hey mark czn you make a big hulkbuster pls
Masterpiece
Anyone can hook a drone to a hat it would have been neat to have unfolded it from the cap in plain site but then again that would take some engineering.
This one has to be one the best speech I’ve ever heard in a long time. Kudos mark! Hope to see more of these amazing video :)
you should write a book 'a guidebook to life' it doesn't tell you what do to, it just shows what you can do
BEST Engineering school on the planet ?? IIT laughs
Amazing speech!!
Monumental
🎉🎉🎉 I embrace every moment of this video
Why does this guy always talk about mario 😭😭
Respected Mark, this is one of them speeches that  i love to the fullest. Full of knowledge and not so boring way to delivering it. Love it and congrats to all of the MITs
Please do content in the Maldives and also in Myokonos and Sweden :D
Thanks for the speech!😊
Imagine the MIT students when one of the famous tech Youtubers come and make a great speech
Truly inspiring speech, Mark. Love it!
My English teacher showed this to the class
Levity with brevity carries longer lasting laughs
That was friggin excellent, Mark.  Thanks for all you do!
What a speech stuff Arnold Schwarzenegger's for motivation let's just listening to this speech ❤️❤️👏👏👏👏👏
Nice,
Not me, someone who hates speeches watched the whole speech cause it was interesting rather than boring
You know you should challenge the hack smith toa build off
I graduated this year but didn't go outside for commencement.  Sorry Mark, it was like 90 degrees out there.
that Elon joke had me rolling 😭
Pretty amazing!
Mark when will you new discovery show come to the uk? I really want to watch it!
what happened to the hat now
*Legendary!!!*
Gotta love those motor beeps from your flying hat <3
Mark, you are the coolest person I've ever watched on Youtube. Well done!
okay mark, i know you gave an incredible speech, but have you eaten that basketball yet???
Gives me narcissist vibes
FAA entered the chat
By invite only I gave an MIT engineering conference presentation on of March 2019 so be grateful one can make it to the top.
Mark you are going to be at dude perfect thing
Great job,  Mark.  You ARE an inspiration. ❤
So boring
HaHa nice. I like how mark structured it like a YouTube video. Great job!
Superrrr!!!!,
Please do a video on lagrange points.. very interesting topic want to know more about it..
thats awesome!
From the section of the video at around 12:34 I need to understand from the learning that problems are features of a solution towards learning + reward. 💟🤔😶‍🌫🫥🦚🕊🧎🧘‍♀🏃‍♀
I want that in my school
That was amazing you inspired me you are the best Mark rober.  Ps your speech was incredible this Is why I watched you for years your fan jay
So. . . where did the hat end up going? Did it make that Mario jump at 8-1 and finally rescued Princess Peach?
The first speech video that I watch till the end 👏
Hahaha dude what an absolute BANGER of a speech and video. You’re an inspiration!
Congrats
Natural speaker.
You should make a squirrel maze but for humans
❤❤❤❤
Mark is the type of guy to walk into a room, engineer something out of some random objects, then give a speech.
i think i found a solution for the too much plastic thing
i meant for the too much plastic
Mark, you're the best.  Have a great day!
But I don’t know how to do it by myself
board children haha funny
this hat has a square on it ... .the square symbolises the normal people (like the base of the pyramid on the 1-USD bank note) that can be wasted in wars
I needed this speech so badly. Thank you for posting this. Thank you.
This is as close to Tony Stark as were gonna get.
I'd hate to be the person giving the commencement speech of 2024. You'd be basically set for failure because how do you even match this.
I love you mark rober!!
Inspiration speech ❤
This was such a great speech it had jokes serious stuff actual inspiration and relatable references
Bla bla bla...
SO COOL!
Love the video, great speech. Funny how i just had an assignment about speeches
I was a part of the graduating class you spoke to and I think your speech was the best part of the ceremony. The advice you gave was inspiring while also being realistic and funny and was the only one that held my attention during that extremely hot day. Thank you for your thoughts and advice :D
My 6 y/o son Sam says “Hello! I think your channel is great!” I also think your channel is great too!
Ok ga lord
Hello mark rober I am currently trying to get in cal tech and was wondering if there are any tips for applying that will help me get in
Great speech, Mark. Congratulations to MITs graduates of 2023.
cat
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH PLS PLS PLS PLS PLS PLS PLS PLA
As someone who is a resident in Massachusetts you said it was 95 degrees there and it was 65 yesterday. Oh and also I hope you enjoyed Boston.
awesome speech! loved it!
Blud dropped the du du du du dudu du du dudududu beat while speech
Wow.. first time reading a prompter?
Legendd
LOL!
meanwhile, no one realizes i could beat up superman.
If it was a president speech he would be next president of America
Well iam a robot so that time traveller one isnt far off
I was playing super Mario deluxe while listening to this.
he put his theme song on. What a champ
WOW. This video made my day. Great advice for anyone!
having a drone lift a hat wasnt crazy impressive so it was kinda anti climatic but i loved the rest of it
yo
keep up the vidios]
He looks like a mixture of tom cruise and bradd pitt
great now i have to wait for 30 years for an epic video
Boy you talked
Great speech!!!
Thank you
Elon : is that a challenge. . . . .
Mark I was the guy you met you wanted to give a shout out to!
This was looooonnnnnggggg.
Mit is my dream university
Mark, you inspire me so much
DUDE I WAS GOING TO DO THIS IVE PLANNED MY DRONE CAP SINCE I WAS NI 5TH GRADE
Now i have a reason to live for 30 more years… cant wait to see the video😂putting it on my calendar!
Mark mentioning confirmation bias reminded me about the story of how one scientist tricked the world into thinking trans fat causes heart disease.
Hey Mark, I'm currently a Senior in High School with a dream of going to MIT and getting a degree in Mechanical Engineering to hopefully pursue a career in biomedical engineering. I've wanted to go to MIT for a few years now but it seems like the only thing holding me back is money which really discouraged me because I thought my dream would never come true. Seeing this video really inspired me to not only continue my journey to hopefully one day get accepted into MIT, but to also not give up when presented with difficult circumstances. Thank you for your beautiful speech.
did he actually fly the drone or was it some one else fpv flying it
Bro this was INSANE!!!!! Hahaha You have so much dedication to literally everything you do(even if it’s something uncomfortable). What a legend ❤
You is inspirational
Pretty sure Pat Sajak retired just because of this speech.
I was here in 2023!
I went to MIT to tour it two days ago they told us you were here
The 1 The Only 💎
Congratulations Mark ❤
My dad graduated from MIT and I met you on the Marriott hotel.❤
I was a mile away I could have met you
I absolutely loved the speech and motivation thank you mark rober! 😊❤
I love you mark your better than MrBeast
congratulations
Beautiful, and inspiring. But what happened to the drone???
What a speech!  Wish I could be there to hear it personally, but I'm internalizing these words, just like if I'm there in the crowd, starting my career, as a naive optimistic new recruit, ready to set foot to the next rock in the river.
1000 out of 10 speech
Hi me in 30 years 👋
This is what I just felt: happy (I laughed a lot) confused (why I wasn’t asleep at 2:00 pm) and INSPIRED!!❤❤❤you did it mark!!!❤❤❤
This will be the only Marc Rober video I won’t watch (I still liked the video)
Bro had his theme song and everything😂
Can you do a video on how you did the drone it would be amazing
that was a great speech i wish i had a mouth
it's nice to hear someone make plans 30 years in the future when everything else online doom-mongering
buncha nerds
When are you eating that basket ball?
People will remember this video in 30 years and wonder where it is lol
That was awesome! I'm not there and I got pumped up!!!! :D
That was awesome 👏🏾
Did the hat ever came back tho?
bro mark made a speech (But seriously, absolute W speech)
This speach is familiar
" You won't know what you will be doing in 20 years" Also "I already planned my youtube video 30 years from now"
Mark is just different. Love him
Can you speak at the Georgia tech commencement in 2027??
June 2053 gotta set a reminder😂
As a university leader, I've attended many commencements and listened to an equal number of commencements speeches. You NAILED it! Very real, very grounded, very applicable, and very inspirational. Practice Naive Optimism. Frame Your Failures. Foster Relationships. Playful Anarchy!! Truly exceptional work, as always.
That's one classic!
Growing older is mandatory,growing up is optional. Really you are the symbol of inspiration dear Mark❤❤❤
One of the things I've learned from this speech is how to pronounce NAIVE
Can you perform the kozyrev mirror experiment?
hay i know you wont read this but if you can can you put your son in more vids i watchd your vid with your son i rilly like him sorry about the grammer i have dislexea
why is the camera quality so bad
Mark, youre an inspiration, i had a little baby girl 2.5 months ago and cant wait to do crunch labs with her and mold her in to a great little engineer with your help!
Did Mark Rober just save my marriage?
While I was expecting the hat to fly over the crowd completely first, incredible video!
Mark Rober, are you a Mark Robber?
If I did that, I’d be having a seizure
I’m 31. This speech still applies to me.   Thank you for inspiring everyone ❤
That is one of the single most inspirational speeches I have ever heard!
I just finished watching your entire Youtube library, four days after you posted your most recent video. Great speech; great career(s); great expectations for what comes next.
One of the biggest sniffers of his own farts going around
"you're a wizard mark"
"your kids will explain at dinner"  best quote i heard so far
4:33
"That's not a bug, that's a feature" - Mark Rober and Mojang
Love your content and your personality! If you need an employee let me know.  I can carry the luggage 😂
19:23 is that elon musk next to red hat
Q for you Mark, what happened to the drone afterwards?
Absolute banger
He was very well worded! He had a fun speech too! Definitely made these kid’s graduation more interesting than just grabbing a piece of paper and shaking some smart guys hand!
Wow for someone who has a fear of public speaking you nailed it. Your speech is beautifully well written and very powerful it really touched me.❤❤❤😊
This is a great speech
Story has it, all of the students fulfilled their occupations with a dream. Congrats mark and MIT Class of 2023
So what are the three pieces of advice in summary, ChatGPT?
My favourite person.
mark you better come back to caltech to do 2027's commencement
At some point in the video I expected he will tell us about his sponsor 😂
Ah yes Marxists in Training.
《The King's Speech》
Wow. Just WOW.
Nice!
Great job Mark!
Hey I was their i and my son love you
audience so dry bru wth 💀💀
“Before I continue my speech I would like to tell you about my sponsor honey” 💀
The Elon Joke got me.
The whole video was a intro
Mark I have and idea I think would be cool to make, a giant air hockey table that you can skate and walk around on without any ice skates
13:28
This is perhaps one of the greatest speeches ive ever heard
In 1999 my English teacher played to my graduating class the Baz Luhrmann song : Sunscreen. Your words feel to me like an update to the advise I took from that song 25 years ago. Thank you for sharing this and offering my children similar worldly advise and an outlook they can relate to and take forward in their lives. ..everyone needs sunscreen     ✌
Bro Mark should make “Here’s The thing “ his new catchphrase😅😅
30
BRO MARK UR AMAZING 👏👏👏👏 THAT WAS A GREAT SPEECH
amazing speech, love it!
Hey must be psychic: “bored siblings” “your kids will explain it at dinner” this is all so accurate 😂
Great advice, brilliant speech....loved it 💪!  Oh hi Mark  🙃!
crushed it
Really inspirational!
Did i miss smth...? Pandemic?😮
AMAZING X100000000
This speech was really amazing Mark!! And congrats to all graduates❤
Great job Mark!  You clearly put so much care and thought into this.  You did GREAT!
This is so wholesome, thank you Mark.
The fact of the matter is that some guy from BYU was invited to the “elite” MIT to give a commencement speech as a guest is honestly a big W for me.
Honestly i thought mark would be a great public speaker, this is really refreshing actually
Should have had a campus-wide devils toothpaste!!!
Simple, Elegant, Brilliant.
Wholesomeness
Its official , Mark is my greatest inspiration❤
Thank you, Mark, for this speech! This was extremely inspirational, and I look forward to using your advice, especially as life has been a bit crazy for me lately. Keep up the great work!
So am I the only one wondering what happens if you pull the paper that says do not pull on the drone
Was it actually written by chatGPT?
bro said and i give you me!!!
Congrats Mark :D
You have inspired me so much through the years and this has been the best speech I have heard but you also inspired me so much more through this speech.
What a NICE Speech!!!!
looking forward to 2053
You filmed this on my birthday
Brilliant!!!
anyones dad coulda made that speech and strapped a drone to a hat ngl
10/10 speach
Well done Mark!
I watched this a few days ago, and I have to say that I found your speech funny, but also unexpectedly wise and worthy of repeated viewings. This was a brilliant speech.
elon musk should comment here replying to me :D
please make a video about mosquitos!
*Mark planning a full 20 years into the future* *Me struggling to get my plans for the week in order* Me: 😓
So did you get your hat back or are you in court and the hat was withheld as evidence?
banger of a speech
I've never watched a video with this much immersion only to realise that I just watched a stranger giving speech at MIT for a whole 20mins, absolutely great speech!
Life is like a videogame guys, go eat magic mushrooms 🍄 and jump on turtle shells 🐢.
yea, my phone's actually going into silent mode for this speech
He missed the sponsorship! :)
4:24  Music kicks in
He said the same thing in ted X talk
It was easy to think this was just another yt video and then the realisation that this was meant for me too came. Class of 2023 all the best to all of us let us be great human beings and always happiest.
TBH HE LOOKS KIND OF LIKE JAMES MURRAY FROM IMPRACTICAL JOKERS 😂
Wish I could like this more than one time
Why the politics in your jokes only go one way?
I can't believe you said stuff about george carlin 😂😂.  That made so happy
It's insanely surreal to see 'YouTubers' being asked to give speeches to graduates, when we could barely take the term seriously a decade ago. Just makes it more inspiring to follow my dreams!
സൂപ്പർ ❤
I scrolled past this and thought, "why is Seth Mcfarland giving a commencement speech?" 😅
Bookmark 5:34
I can't wait to see part 2. I hope I'm still around too.
I love this speech so much, really was the timeless advice we need.
3:43 'unless Elon buys it.'  @ElonMuskZone
should have hat tossed when the drone went straight up
Because WHY NOT!!!! That will be my motto from now on!
The most inspiration I’ve ever gotten has now come from this video thank you Mark.
Me and my brother found out that when you put the disks upside down the fly way faster and farther with the crunch labs disk launcher!
This is a powerful speech. You literally gave them a great advise about life after their university.
Meh
I liked the ending
Elon DONT by youtube
my dad was thare
Thanks for the words of wisdom! I especially took the 3rd piece of advice to heart, as I also had a loved one who passed away of ALS. They showed me so much about loving people and the impact of kindness. So thanks for the words and can’t wait to see the 2050 video! 😊
We are the squirrel that eats all the peaches off the tree any ideas on how to deter them little angels from becoming peach peach Khatir’s
Want State is MIT in?
I absolutely loved the talk about "confirmation bias"!  That is a great way to think about it.
Bro really started playing his theme no hate tho
W
The other speeches:
Where can I send fan mail for you.
Love how he essentially talked smack to MIT staff through the awning. that was my favorite part and had me rolling on the floor.
What dance is that, Mark?!
Thank you for posting your speech! It's one I wish I've heard decades ago, and has taught me much!
Why do teachers teach the evolution theory as history when it is a theory and theory isn't history and real facts?
at my brothers graduation they also did a thing about chat gpt. pretty weird
W mark
Great speech! We’ve all heard the advice to picture of the audience in their underwear… Pretty terrible advice. Next time, think about the most bored you’ve ever been and really steep yourself in that before you speak. It works wonders for me and everyone I’ve taught it to!
That’s a wonderful perspective for anyone trying to forge a future. TY, Mark.
a
Masterpiece 💖💖💖
Congratulations on your graduation
You got rid of the shower hair mural video!!! Why!!!!
Is there any way to play that puzzle you mentioned?
I have seen that on their channel I have always wanted to go there
Buzz never went to the MOON MARK!!!!!! lol either way awesome speech!!
Who was the fpv pilot?
i feel like the best part of this was that you were nervous. showed that its okay to be nervous and have stumbles as long as you keep going, that it's okay to stumble.
Mark really nailed the public speaking! From the moment he is up there, with all the extras and playing music parts and so on and so forth till the end of the speech it is just so pleasant how he keeps the crowd listening and engaged at all times! Thank you for all your hard work!
At 5:33
I did not know he was In college
I graduated from high school not to long ago
I just graduated from my university and this speech was better than everything said at my own commencement
Bro what is this video 💀
Wow! Just wow. From now on, I'm letting Chat GPT write my essays.
same
Elon: And I took that personaly.
You are amazing. Thank you for everything you said and everything you do!
Great speech Mark!
Epic commencement speech!  Awesome job, Mark!
That was awesome. I'm glad I got to watch
Mark, thanks for posting this. While I did not graduate from MIT, our commencement speaker canceled last minute- so I’ve adopted this as mine.
Now I have 30 years to wait that’s great
Dang! Mark should do more public speaking like this!
15:10😅😅😅👌💟
That was freaking amazing speech.
17:54 "this is actually a great opportunity, to mention our sponsor for today, Hello Fresh!". Was it just me that was expecting that?
whats MIT?
Yess sirrr finally
<3
HOW DID NOBODY HEAR THE ESCS?
love the reference from mario
Thank you mark Thank you
Great speech
And now Pat Sajak is retiring because of your speech.
6:08 That didn’t age well  (Pat Sajak just announced he’s quitting Wheel of Fortune)
This is awesome ❤
in case i come back here in 2053, great video my guy!
Loved the speech! One of the most original and cute)
That speech and video were an absolute banger! 🎉
The speech was awesome.I rarely look at this type of vid but I looked at yours
Dude I feel like he was speaking to such a tough crowd.
Just the motivation I needed...
since when did mark become a dad?
if your mother influence was only a ripple that has made you what you're today, Bro you turned out into a tsunami.
Mark this speech was amazing, I hope to listen to your life lessons to try and better myself and the world. Your public speaking skills are also amazing :)
I’m expecting great things for June 2053
If you saw the MIT video this is basically a reupload of MITs video....
Best commencement speech ever
This is so much opposite to the Asian way of "Failure/Emotional damage" education. SIGH
Great, now stop messing with your eyebrows,... you look weird bro,...
Awesome speech, but now I want Elon to purchase YouTube... 😂
Mark. This was amazing.
Bad at public speeking?! Sure! I had a tear before point 1 and then at the start of point 3. Anybody who's been struggling at their job and with their coworkers/friends need to hear this. Im wiping tears just ask I'm typing this. Great speech! 😢🥺😊🙂🤓❤️👍
.
This speech resonates even with me
That is what I called by an influencer
Awesome work Mark! Thanks for sharing
Outstanding speech! Like this if u agree!
loved this so much !!! you made a HUGE celebration even better with all the little jokes <3
An amazing speech! Applies to everyone no matter where you are in life! Keep your heads up everyone and go out and change the world
Hey what the heck this was same speech in tedx talk You're copying 🤔
YOYOYOYIOOOO
No way this is written by Chat GPT
YouTube would be better if elon bought it
Ugh as an MIT alum (class of 2018) I'm so insanely jealous that this year's class got you as a speaker.
Such a class act!!!
That was an awesome speech. Super inspiring.
Cool!
Personally, I thought you did an amazing job.
If you like drones.... Ukrainian drone operators could make you a great show with fireworks, ask next time
Great speech mark
This was a great speech and it was so inspiring!
Felt like I was there! So much inspiration!
finally, a speech that didn’t put me to sleep!
Best commencement speech I’ve heard.
Outstanding.
What a great graduation speech!  And what a privilege to have that speech at your graduation.  Lucky, lucky MIT grads!
Amazing speech!!!! (4 exclamation marks because why not)
I never knew your mom had ALS. My dad has it too. I've watched your videos for years and am one of your biggest fans!
I was suspecting the speech getting written by AI.
I think he should run for president
Wow, just WOW!
ah yes. my dream education. its a dream
Why did I feel the need to clap at the end...alone in my room
immagine, if in the middle of the vid there was a sponsor
I didn’t get the platinum ticket yet :(
I can see the memo to 2024 MIT grads: For reasons of health and safety, only manual, unpowered mortarboard launches are allowed at the graduation ceremony.
Very cool
2053?
Well done, sir.
Elon... please don't ruin youtube 🙂 😅
Your speech was unbelievable, I had goosebumps from your words. well done. 🩶👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
My dream school!
Well spoken Mark!
👏👏👏👏👏
I am really curious why the label of "DO NOT PULL"...
Hahaha that was awesome. What a dope dude
Can’t wait for the collab
omg, we went on a school trip to boston a week or so ago, and we visited MIT, and our guide person told us there was a graduation 2 hours prior to our arrival there- and i believe the graduation they were talking about was this one, omg slay. it wouldve been such a nice thing to witness even though we probably wouldnt have been allowed lmao, wouldve been really cool to hear that irl:)
WE NEED A MARK ROBER PODCAST!.
Great speech, Mark. You didn't get half the reactions that you deserved.
I always felt like something was missing from my academic experience when my school cancelled our commencement ceremony for my undergrad class back in Tehran, Iran, because we were told “art schools don’t deserve a real graduation ceremony”. Now I am a year away from graduating from my 3 year MFA program in the US, and keep feeling like I don’t deserve a future, and I might never have one. After watching this video, I am adopting this speech and ceremony as mine and choose to reimagine my graduation in this beautiful context. Thank you for sharing this video for all the rest of who weren’t MIT class of 2023 to see and be inspired by. Big.. tears.. coming.. in.. oh boy ❤🎉
Great speech Mark! 👏👏
Love the river - life analogy
the music xD
Loved everything Mark said except for the 6 million year comment
i realy hope, that i can be present at such a interesting, inspiring and funny speech at some point in my life. that was so great.
Guess Ill be back in 20 years sue me if im not.
The music tune is "Blue Wednesday" by "Cereal Killa". Enjoy!
Great speech, Mark.  Top Honors. 🙂
Fantastic commencement speech, MIT class of 2023 will truly remember who their speaker was and retell the story over and over. Something I cannot do for my graduation ceremony. Thanks for sharing.
Great work mark. I hope someday I’ll study at MIT
One of the best speech i have ever seen, as someone who is about to graduate i found your advice very close to me , so thank you Mark.
I genuinely needed to hear that… Thank you for being you.
MY HERO!!!
I sou you on stage
Ain't no way he brought the explanation music with him
Please run for President
I was the board cousin
I feel bad for the next speaker
bes5 graduation speech ive heard till now!!!!!
Hi future me….
I was there
Thank you for vocalizing what I feel are some of the most important things a human being needs to do to have a positive influence around them. Of all of our children grow up thinking this way, the world can truly be a better place.
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
I only commented on this video because, my brother has seen literally all of your videos.
absolute beast.
One of my favorite chemistry podcasters was recently at MIT to give a educational presentation.
Hands down the most entertaining yet meaningful commencement speech I've ever come across! "I wouldn't have it any other way.." such an inspiration!
The frame at 18:58 is perfect.  Nice job Mark!
That was an amazing speech
Monkey
Love the dig at Musk.
Very well done and inspiring speech :)
I wanna go to MIT im only 14 but its my dream to go there
Great vid and speech, thank-you for all that you. Have done for the field of science.
I swear if I miss that collab vid I’m going to be so sad. I might not have been part of that graduation in the sense I’m not in college at all rn. However I’m still intrigued on the future you’ll make for yourself and your love of engineering. Have a great day
that was a long speech.
you made me cry and i will say to you "Well done"
Congrats MIT class in 2023! My final message: change the world! Goodbye
❤❤❤❤❤
Best commencement speech ever.  So motivating.   Not your typical speech.  Thank for motivating our future!
the goat
I'm not crying, YOU'RE crying!
Wow
But did you eat a basketball yet?
Copied the ending of the viral Georgia tech commencement speech. The real MIT
Thank you for putting this out
This is a great speach, well done Mark!
mark rober I really like your videos greetings from Chile I am using a translator to be able to comment
Mark Rober me gustan mucho tus videos saludos desde chile
Gonna save this video for my upcoming convocation speech😂
Let’s hope Elon doesn’t buy anything else 🤣
Mark, your speech is inspiring, encouraging, humorous, and meaningful. Thank you so much for sharing. I am deeply touched.
Perfect.
Hi i m a student and ur videos have alwas been inspiring i want to do a project with you .Can u find a way out.Ty
Well done mark😅😅
Mark is actually woke
Bro roasted MIT 20 seconds into the speech. He might've gotten himself uninvited to the next event
'I give you me' was a funny sentence of how he said it so proudly.
Mark Rober is the Willy Wonka of speechs
Y not give a creature, that can learn and grow, the ability to be forgiven, and to forgive
*plandemic
Who is this guy? 😂
How does he get the shot at @19:20 in which we can see the entire cap and drone setup from the drone camera itself? There should be a pole extending up from the drone on which the camera is attached, but I don't see a pole extending out of frame.
The hat was never seen again..
Fantastic speech Mark! Adressed to engineers at MIT but applicable to all walks of life. Fabulous.
Really amazing!!! Inspirational and emotional! Great speech. Thank you for sharing this😊👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Quit youtube and become a comedian! Amazing jokes!
Great speech, Mark!
THIS WAS B4 COD LMFAO
Thanks mark. This is what was needed. At the correct time. Thanks❤
Remember, hes an engineer, Not a comedian.
I can’t believe you made me WANT to watch a speech. Nice job
me:  don't fly the drone over crowds, don't fly the drone over crowds, don't fly the drone over crowds.......(he flies it over the awning and buildings)....whew
Mark the fact that you used a George carlin quote made me truly believe in you as a human
Love this video ❤
That's an amazing speech, very roberic.
Well done my friend.
Epic Speech lol
MARK ROBER i found you on TV not on youtube but just searching around in discovery+
Absolutely amazing and thoughtful MIT speech, well done mark. A wonderful ending too.
Can you do another one for Class of 2031?
That was fantastic!!
Mark. You know you're an inspiration.  Keep on keeping on Brother.  This world NEEDS you ❣️🤙🤘👍🏼👍🏼
Amazing speech Mark. You are truely an inspiration.
Most boring mark rober vid so far
This was great Mark!!!!
Wow, amazing speech!
My grandfather alsonpassed away from ALS
Never went to University, or gotten a degree in anything else other then being the best parent out there, subjectively. But dang Mark, this was not just for those at MIT. This was for all of us too. Thanks buddy!
Ain’t no way bruh💀💀💀
Yeah?  No one's heard of your top professor.  Who was it?  Sup.  Respect fartman
Congrats on getting on trending Mark
Probably one of the best speech i ever heard
yep bring politics into it. im out
Awesome
Best. Speech. Ever.
6:41  Everyone: Wow such a great speech  Me: That white flying bug looks cool
Congratulations on taking on your own personal challenge by giving this speech. Keep growing my friend one rock at a time. 😊
Feels nice to be 2023 Graduate !
What a fraud. He doesn't even build the stuff in his videos. He has other people make them, then pretends he did it.
Thank you Mark for this awesome speech!
You're awesome Mark! Love the incredible work you are doing!
Rober giving a speech instead of some divisive politician is so refreshing.
You can tell it the juicy because the music is back
Came here to see the onboard flight video and landing...  We need to see the landing as well.... ;)
Asking civil engineers to back off though made my day
Thanks mark
By the time we see what the graduation class of 2023 does I'd be into my 30s and I don't know if I'm prepared for that...
That was a fab speech.   Well done.   I look forward to the second half.
This is one of the best speeches I’ve listened to. Mark, you are an big inspiration to lots of people around the world, and theres no one better to give a commencement speech at MIT than you.
Strangely, as a musician, I have the opposite problem with being on stage... I'd much rather be in front of THOUSANDS of people, than to perform in front of just a few people (auditions for instance). The more people, the more they just kinda melt into this amorphous blob of cells with no consciousness haha
It amuses me that a guy with 24M+ subscribers on YouTube doesn't like public speaking. I know that it's different because you can edit videos later, but it's funny.
I thought this already uploaded?
This is very helpful to me not for the material but for the nervousness of talking because while I won't be giving a commencement speech I'll be defending my thesis in 3 days
The music kicking in was my favourite part 😂
Only commencment speech that people watch willingly 😁
:O
That was an amazing speech! 😊
Hahaha dude what an absolute BANGER of a speech and video. You’re an inspiration!
So much pressure, mark is really a dedicated youtuber. lol
Hey mark im that one guy who
I saw you in San Jose
That was incredible and the best commencement speech I’ve ever heard! Loved your values and encouragement! Thank you for spreading joy!
Can we viewers still get that funny basketball eating video?
Some of this speach gave me CGP Grey vibes. 👍
You are a national treasure
We were on a school trip there in Boston and visited mit and saw them setting up the graduation ceremony 😊
That's pretty special.
and remember , that gender studies class is worth nothing in real life- real life doesn't have trigger warnings, safe spaces, etc
This is MIT's 5th most viewed video on their channel
BRAVO!
A great speech from a truly gifted human.
FPV FPV FPV FPV!!!!
The only person worthy of giving commencement speeches. Protect mark at all costs.
If only I put in a bit more effort in highschool I would be sitting there listening to this speech live
17:50 Why did I think he was going to say timeout for a sponsor 😭😭
Mark your such an inspiring person the speech was amazing
I wanna be in a vid pls 😊😊😊
such a privilege to have spoken on the same stage as you– really appreciate your inspiring words and wow what a hard act to follow!! thank you for sending our class off in style :)
Better you have this invite than that silly Hubert Cumberdale of a human we call Melon Husk…oops I mean Elon Musk. That’s the one.
I graduated in 2016 and confirm all to be true. It’s hard but just do it.
This was excellent - taking the commencement speech to the next level as only you could - bravo !!!
This was awesome to listen to. 😌
Hey I live near there
Woah!! Another video!! Within a month!!
Cool
Epic!  Wait... They have civil engineers at MIT????
But where did the cap go?
That was a truly phenomenal and spot on speech. I loved your stream analogy for life.
Bro really said 2053! That’s insane. Go Mark! ❤
Oh no. 22 year olds don't know who Pat Sajak is 👴🏻😭
Bro sneaked in a Kanye diss
Where’s Tony stark? Oh wait that’s mcu oh wait he ded well this took a turn
I guess it makes sense that filling Australia with a bunch of convicts resulted in the survival of non-cooperative genes. That has been my life experience anyway.
That speech was pretty great. I love the effort you put into it so that it can be engaging. It’ll be so much more memorable because of the excitement and presentation you emanated, which I assume you learned from YouTube!
Have Naive Optimism Frame Your Failures Foster Meaningful Relationships Engage In Playful Anarchy
Mark…how dry was your mouth?
If by some miracle I make it to MIT in 3 years, can you come back and do another grad speech please 🙏
Wow great speech
Banger Video!! 🎉🎉
hi my self in 30 years, this is really emotional also i cant belive you actually watching this, you have a kid? are you a world champ? im kinda sad that this moment is gone but yeah hi everyone
I like to think classes of MIT are above Nintendo and Bowser but maybe I am wrong lawl...😂
Americans still retain the graduation tradition from their former English masters while retaining the language too 😅.
Bro gave perspective changing advice and then set a first person to ever do something record😂
noice
genius planting a future video here
Wonderful, thoughtful and emotional commencement speech Mark. Also to bring your mom into the picture, a lovely tribute. Well done! Bernie, Sydney Australia.
What a great speech.
Gotta have that music
1:32
Ah, a new generation of Ivy League tech graduates.  Ready to go out into the world and rid their professions of systemic racism.
I’m still waiting for you to eat a basketball
As one who inspires to be an engineer , I’m so thankful you shared this video to those who aren’t in MIT(yet 😉) thank you for you tips and influence on me and all the others who look up and aspire to you,❤❤
Mark, I've been down very low lately, and this speech, even though it's not for me, gave me that courage to push through. Thank you so much.
ok
You should make a car that has bullet proof windows and that traps the person in the car untill police arrive to arest the suspect or car jackings
👍👍👏👏👌👌
nailed that speech mark!
I'm from europe, and I can't imagine how long such a ceremony is if the only the Mark Robert part took 20 minutes

Mark is buddies with gill bates. Says all ya need to know when he talks smack about Elon...island buddies?
Mark really owns this background music
Great speech! Can't wait for 2053!
In the voice of mario: itsa me, mark, letsa play! -- the hat!
That was a great speech, Mark! It really hit home for me and I actually teared up a bit. Thank you for what you do.
Great speech.  Thank you.
13:18 Even a few hundred years ago life was much harder.
When one is a Gamer, they can live a 1,000 life's.
Totally beautiful!
My dad was there!!!!!!!
YOO
!remind me in 30 years
no joke, might've been the best speech i've ever heard
Doston main aik youtuber hun agr apka bhi channel hai toh ao mil kr kaam krein aur kamaein
thanks for the positive influence Mark
Naive optimism explains Mark's support of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.  The speech was awesome of course.
Terrific speech
Brilliant as an Australian I am more than qualified to say so NO?
Nice job mark 🙊
Great job! Fun, informative, and on point advice. You (and your mom) are making a difference!
Mark just single-handedly destroyed Kanye and Elon in the same commencement speech...dang LMAO
i bet there's science behind the music...
Totally loved this! Bravo Zulu!
Saw your speech on MIT's page and I gotta say you've inspired so many people to push past the difficulties of life and get through. Thanks Mark!
Thanks Mark
I saw Mark's speech first from MIT's youtube channel, and it so cool to see mark's video after watching that one
Mark , the honor is our the kids the new generation to get inspired from you , your achievements and honestly the love try fail and succes mentality of you ❤❤
What's the difference between school and life? In school, we're given a lesson, and then a test. And in life, we're given a test, that teaches us a lesson.
Am I the only one who expected Mark's hat to explode at the climax of the music?
I am a high school student from a small town of Pakistan but one day I will be graduating from mit thanks for motivating me
To many long WOrdS ahhhhhhhhhhhh
The first video in a long time without graphics, just a non-stop recording (for the most part). Love how you changed it up this time
you can really notice how he gets more and more comfortable during his speech
Bro edited on stage 💀
Amazing speech!!
3:11 well, time to time warp 30 years to see it
WONDERFUL SPEECH FROM REAL WORLDY GUY !!!!!!!
❤
i was doing a geography project and i was nervous, then i became one of the coolest kids in school , this speech reminds me of mine
Great speach mark. It was really inspiring.
It's funny. I was waiting for the music to kick in also.
This was amazing to watch from the audience. Thanks Mark for making the end of my undergrad experience special :)
congrats mark!
You're amazing, Mark
That was so fun and thoughtful! Hats off to you, sir. Well done 👏
U rock
i wanted to meat you but i didn't know you were at MIT a few days ago i could have come
Proud of you Mark
Been following your channel for a while so was soo excited when you were announced as the commencement speaker. Truly mean it when I say this speech made me a better person and I've watched it multiple times now haha. Low key wish you were speaker for my year (2025) lol but I'm just honored regardless that you spoke at my schooool. Thank you so much for an amazing speech and an even more amazing channel!
Really well done Mark what a great speech and from someone who hate doing them hats off to you much love and respect from England
You are so smart
I’m crying
only 29 seconds in and I think 'I really like this dude' lol
I like your bias Mark!
For someone who “doesn’t like public speaking” that is one of the best and most memorable commencement speeches I’ve ever heard. After the stress of MIT I bet that speech made those students 4 years
That was awesome!!!! 💯💯💯
Mark is an exceptional human being! We love you big dawg!
Well done Amark!
Funny speech 😂
That was sweet.
Fancy dress xD
Rober is a boss
It's too bad MIT does social sciences... really destroys the reputation of the school.
Congratulations
Yikes I feel bad for anyone who has to follow up Mark on the podium haha that'll be tough to garner the same enthusiasm 💯
👍 👍
None of the speakers at any of my commencements have held a candle to you!  MIT grads lucked out this year!
Even from thousands of miles away and more than a year after my graduation, I fell as every word was dedicated to me. I keep learning new things and sort of "Upgrading" every day, and this video definitely contributed to it. Thank you so much Mark for encouraging us to be curious and learn from our mistakes, I can feel I'm getting really close to Bowser already 💪🏻😎
YOU are one of the best inspiration for me ❤🎉
Chat gpt!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Amazing!
Very impressive remembering the whole speech!
This was incredible Mark! Thank you 🙏
Hey mark I want you to know that it is you who has made me want to go into astronomy and science 😊
GOOSEBUMPS!
I hate speeches. Really hate them. But this was just awesome. I laughed and cried and am still crying slightly lol. And I'm not even in the crowd. Amazing speech!
Well done
GREAT SPEECH!!!
A-M-A-Z-I-N-G
This is possibly one of the greatest speeches I have ever heard!!
hi
I know ive never been in MIT, or any collage at that but, what he's saying is just inspiring... And funny of course.
He so cool :3
Love it! Great job to not only memorize your speech, but also to make it all work out! You clearly have a positive outlook and use it to inspire others!!
Nice speach
Amazing!
Goosebump through my whole body!!!
Can't wait for June 2053.... watch it really happens...
Kinda ironic that am watching this while I have this semester's exam season but I already plan on dropping out and finally getting a job with zero experience It'll be worth it though
That was awesome. And I'm pretty sure I'll remember that speech much better than the one at my own college graduation. (You're already ahead because there's no chance I remember who spoke or what they said back then lol)
Nice
you hVE CHANGED ME AND MY MOMS LIFE AND COn verstations all for the better we love u mark and admire you to the max <3 thank you <3 ! :)
IIT ka naam suna hai?
You did a great job in speaking and it was a really well crafted speech! Big pat on the back.
Your speech leaves me speechless.
Can you make more of your show on DMAX?
You did so well! ❤
This speech was amazing. Excellent job!
Beautiful speech ❤
Fantastic!  Loved it!
"it's a feature, not a bug"  shots fired at Bethesda.  Amazing speech Mark. You are truely an inspiration.
So cool! Words of wisdom and a flying hat , what more could they have asked for? 🎉
I loved this.
Almost cried
Sorry I had to stop at the global pandemic part. Done with BS call it what it was.
Very inspiring!
Inspiring!
Woah, I assumed Mark was bald cause he always wears the cap. First time no hat. So surprised 😮
This video is gonna be a banger ❤❤
Barlos 2053 you better have made it in the fitness industry obsessing over your future like you’ve been doing. Also say hi to everyone for me 😊 love you bro
Loved it❤each and everything! I feel like I need to watch this a few more times!
he got theme muisic for a real life speach lmao
this is such a well written speech for it's audience 🤯
Amazing speech
Currently I am to choose what I will do workwise in the future. This helped and uplifted me to go for something even though everything seems quite overwhelming. Thanks!
I love you so much for being you!!!
So many McD workers here, kinda heartwarming
Congrats❤
Suppose you got a speech to make after him…😅
14:17 Perhaps this is the only time we’ll hear Mark give advice on romantic relationships (of course it encompasses other relationships too)! Casting people in the best light is hard sometimes but it’s so rewarding in the long run to reframe in a positive light.   Thanks for inspiring millions across the world now and perhaps billions in the future to make the world and university better!!
Yo this was fire
I have watched it before it is on the channel 😂❤
Epic!  Well done, Mark!
Well said bro
9:55 I recently beat Super Mario Bros., Super Mario World, and Super Mario Bros. 3: it was absolutely brutal.  Also, great speech.
Great speech Mark. Very inspirational
What a great speech!!!😊
I love the ending
Great job
the jokes aren't laning for em but they cracking me up at home 💀
What a performance 🔥🔥🔥
This speech make me feel like i should really get my college degree that i been delaying for 10+ years
Mark you are an inspiration, l am being called  towards cyber security but this still is truely inspirational. For everyone
This is the best speech I have ever heard. Really well done!
The first time I listened to a speach fully in my life..
I have my YouTube channel and I can help you.🔥🔥🔥Main YouTube per hun mera channel hai main aapki madad kar sakta hun.🔥🔥
that speach was absolutely beautiful
Is there really tow ways to get to the top of M.T.fudge? 8:22
great speech, Mark!
2023 terms for the peeps very inspiring well done mark
Mark, you are the poster child for the saying “Growing older is mandatory, growing up is optional”. Well done!
Bloody marvellous!😊
6:57 like glitter spraying, farting, and recording box’s?
Woo great speech !
Well done speech
Channel became a showcase
Absolutely inspirational Mark, you should be so proud of yourself and I cannot wait to see the follow-up video in 2053 and showing my kids all the amazing work you'll continue to do in the meantime!
One of the greatest speeches I ever heard in general and probably the best speech to engineering graduates ever given. I fought back some tears during that speech haha
Great advice mixed with humor and engineering. I enjoyed it.
a little bit much on the self promotion
We need to come together as one humanity so we can grow stronger and achieve things no one can think about today
i prefer to throw away my life
Well done! Terrific life advice. I hope I'm around to see the 30 year update!
4:33 When the music kicks in
he uploads faster now? EPIC 0:30
Was it just me or was that a really tough crowd?
Actually performed above expectations (which weren't low)
As much as it would be scary that was the best speech I’ve ever heard
Dude that speech was amazing.
That was awesome. Great speech!
Let’s pray Sheldon Cooper doesn’t see this 😅
Public speaking is scary and yes I agree
That Kanye line went hard
Best speech I’ve ever heard in my life
I'm definitely adding this to my list of motivational videos to rewatch when I'm feeling like a worthless piece of s***.
The students were lucky to have you inspire them. You inspire every day
Bro tried to give us a speech but gave us Super Mario cheat codes
I watched the speech on the official MIT channel, and seeing it with the drone footage gave it a totally different perspective. Both 'versions' are great, all the best to the graduates!
I love you, Mark Rober. You are such a special person. ❤
Thank you Mark for having acted as a source of inspiration for me, Raza :)
This is one of the most incredible speeches I've ever seen in my life. Love it, Mark!
When he started to play his own background music.....incredible ahahaha
in my 6th grade codeing class we learned about MIT a little
Seeing most of the crowd being so stonefaced and jaded during the speech is a little unsettling to me, but then again, I have no idea what these guys went through in that place.
I am so glad that someone like you was invited to speak at the commencement
1,6 mio on 20 hours
This video had my find out that, yes, you can plan stuff 30 years into the future in Google Calendar. Just press "G" to easily enter any date, and prevent tapping through 30 years.  I just hope I'm still around in 30 years ☺
👏👏👏👏👏👏👍👍👍👍👍
🤗
Congratulations Mark !!  Your videos is really a big impact in technology im looking forward to your new upcoming videos and thank for the speech
The music q’s is just…
My education started all over again and in many diverse fields when I found Youtube.  I have had the pleasure to stun both my University sons with things I found on Youtube they didn't even know existed, or at least how the heck did Dad know that.
Epic prompt engineering, Mark, just epic! 😂  But really, such an amazing speech and a truely human and humble delivery. As someone who knows the difficulty of public speaking this was incredible to watch. You, sir, have done an amazing job here, hats off indeed.
What a role model!
I AM SEEING THIS 3RD TIME JUST BECAUSE I LOVE HIS SPEECH SO MUCH
Day 2 of commenting make a robot to dunk a basketball on a 10ft hoop and then vs it with the worlds best dunker      (This is my friends idea YT: Zone)
Mark for president
E
most of them probably dont even know you due to the fact they are doing real science. lol
12:05 they didn't laugh because it was too real 💀
💜👍
Dudes like the new age Bill Nye! 😅
This is legitimately the best speech I have ever watched so very well done on that. I also can't wait to be 46 and watch that banger collab you were talking about haha.
I HAD A DREAM THAT MARK WILL QUIT YT AND START TELLING SPEECHES AROUND
Hey Alexa. Set a reminder for 30 years from now to tune into Mark Robers YouTube channel.
I liked the fact that you remembered George Carlin. Thank you! What a legend he was.
Why does Mark look like Murr doing a punishment for losing an Impractical Jokers episode?
Great speech. Simply great(but isnt this pretty similar to your tedx talk)
Love how he paused after saying a joke and no one laughs😊
I wish if Mark would come back to MIT for another commencement speech if I get into MIT and graduate. Such an amazing guy
I honestly felt inspired on their behalf
tough watch
What a great speech. Loved that, and some great advice!
Who actually watched the whole video 😆
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I got goosebumps watching the opening line of your speech. Well done! Great speech
Nervous Public Speech but hey well done! Mark the speech is so flawless I don't know MIT means I'm sorry2 is a due respect of it I enjoying the videos of him a
Two videos in one month? Nice. Mark Rober has spoken yes yes.
Incredible speech!
see you in 30 years maybe somehow lol
I love his river metaphor about how you can only see a few steps ahead in life while the future changes over time
Mehn! That was a great speech, you’ve inspired a lot of people, and I’m glad I got to know about you and your works! Keep doing what you’re doing! 🙏🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
He may've just given a reason to live till 2053 just out of sheer curiosity.
I wish he made this before my graduation so I can use his words as a quote
6:04 I have to disagree with you here Mark, A lot of people have predicted that they will be dead in 20 years. And I have no doubt someone died, within that 20 years after saying that.
This is the speech I would pay to attend live! 😂❤️ Well done Mark!
Strapping a quadcopter to a hat doesn't seem like a genius invention.
POV: You watched this on MIT’s channel already but are happily watching it again.
“And bored siblings” Literally so true.
What a speech
Great Speech 🎉🎉🎉
gj (stands for great job)
the video makes the crowd seem pretty unenthused, but nearly everyone around me was laughing at his jokes :) thanks for speaking at our commencement!
10/10 speech
amazing  Mark, you can do it and you do. Public speaking is tough but if you know everything or almost it has to be easier, most people are just worried about forgetting their speech. anyways great speech and you are very well respected.
👍
Did he memorize this whole thing?
Very well done!  A little nervous, for sure, but you knocked it out of the park... or flew it out of the crowd? 😄
Very well done!!
Incredible
and not only a great speech for this generation (specifically with the metaphors and jokes) but number 5 on trending currently
5:10 the silence was loud
when you hear the music turn on, you already know you gotta start listening frfr
That.Was.Awesome!
Really really entertaining. Well done. 👏👏
“How am I gonna bring it to Luigi that I just murdered his brother” 😂😂
4:35 that gave me goose bumps. I can’t even express the beauty in that moment and the nostalgia that went through me.
Please do this for my mit graduation
Absolutely nailed it mate 💪👏👏
I actually teared up a bit in the end. Something about the sincerity , goodheartedness and goofiness of it all.
B E A UTIFULL
Duct taping a drone to your hat is by far the dumbest thing you could have done in front of a bunch of real engineers.
That was very cute!
Its obvious the nervousness is there but, hey Congratulations!
Well done
Gotta love Mark, including as a speaker.  He was even better, though, as he worked to defeat his neighborhood's squirrel population!  Lol
Well done sir mark rober  You are my mentor 💞💞   Love from PAKISTAN 🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰❤❤❤❤❤
F MIT
MY LIFE IS LIKE A VIDEOGAME
Wow
The speech was perfect😂😂
engineer tf2
I needed that! Thanks Mark!
As an actual engineer, Mark is the perfect choice to give a comment speech at MIT. Well deserved.
Inspiring Call to collaborate with the batch to end the speech. It’s an inspiring beginning for the graduates!
I mean, I needed this peech too! Thanks Mark! You're an amazing person 🔥♥️
amazing
Looking forward to the 2053 update bossman
Pretty.corny I wouldn’t do that again
The speech has very very very similar beats and themes from the commencement speeches given by Conan in Darthmouth and Harvard
That’s a great speech
The cool thing about the internet is that we are absolutely going to hold mark to his June 2053 video
Wow. Abt to cry thanks for the engineering paradigm revolution
Interesting concept. Naive optimism vs progressing work done. This debunks the idea of the working in a vacuum aka spending a month in a lab to save a day in the library. :D.  You surely broke the rules here....endorsed by MIT. Hooray!
I’m literally going to listen to this whenever I start to doubt myself 😢😊😅
Wait i am so confused i saw the exact same speech 3 days ago... but this is uploaded 16h ago  Whaaaaa
What a wonderful human being.
Mark, your speech was really well done. As someone who just graduated high school and is going on to an STEM engineering school in South Dakota. You’ve even given me hope and inspiration for my next steps in life. Your advice was really impactful and can be shown to not just graduates, but to anyone. Thank you for your words of Advice.
That was frikken amazing. Well done, can't wait to see what y'all do next.
Nice Mark!
Already watched this video!! Fantastic speech Mark <33
where was the word from your sponsor? :(
This is your one chance because it wont be around soon enough.
Point number 5: The Institute is the only hope for humanity.
Way to go Mark. Made the graduation about you.
Legends know this video is uploaded again
Thank you for the encouragement and cheer up. I'm half way college (civil engineering) and I feel I now nothing but my teacher's names.  I start a new job at a construction on Monday and I am terribly scared of messing up.  Just, thank you for sharing and being so inspiring. 🤝❤️‍🩹 (Sorry if I have grammar errors or vocabulary or something, English is my second language and I'm still learning, I translate from spanish to english).
Great speech Mark!👍🏻 👨‍🎓
I’m waiting for the day where the 1st YouTuber gets the medal of Freedom I’m calling it, it is going o be Mark Rober or Mr.Beast or Both
Great speech mark!
The white dot going across the screen made me miss like 5-10 seconds
i wish i could study there💔💔
Inspirational
Someone Kids can Emulate....Shared....Great Speech....
Awesome videos sorry im soooo late
Well done!!
One of the best speeches I've listened to in awhile. That brought me happy tears 😭
Mark’s speech is trending on YouTube! Proud of him!
I've been struggling to graduate this year in HS and this speech has definitely helped me to review my position and continue on. Thank you Mark for that and all the amazing content you make for millions of people. <3
If I could like this video more than once I would
That's not a bug, it's a feature... - Mojang
what was bro yapping abt
Mark should give every speech for every occasion for ever more 😊
Mark you are such a dork. Your jokes were hilarious. Continue being funny and changing lives!
i have book marked this as "modvation"
wow. just wow.
Looks like Mark Rober went from designing engineering marvels to designing elaborate revenge pranks for porch pirates
That intro was fire
I am touched
Wacthed on MIT channel but came here again to support u. MUCH LOVE!!!!!
W Amazing speech
Hey mark this was posted on my b-day and congratulations
This is so real and inspiring to hear... It really connects.
😀😉
What a fun speech!
The comedy in the speech is amazing the bored siblings will no longer Nobel bored
Mark engineered engineers.
I wish YouTube had something more than a like
I wonder how many of the graduates there still watched this video the whole way through hoping to see themselves
Can’t wait for that video in thirty years!
As a tradesperson who has to follow the designs and bidding of engineers...... theyre not the brightest bunch in the world. And usually rely on tradespeople like us to point out what they want cannot be done. Like the engineer that designed the gravity fed sewerage line to my parents house.... to the street above their house. Heres hoping these people do great things and dont fuel the almost constant facepalming that i have to deal with
I'm sure I'm not the first to ask, where did your hat end up? Great speech Mark! 🥰👍
Thanks!
Guys its Harrison Wells from the flash reverse flash go away already how did u survive being erased from existence cisco what's going on
That was an epic speech - great job Mark.💥💥💥
Having Mark Rober giving a speech in your MIT graduation is like what you want to expect in a speech in your MIT graduation, if I was giving a speech I would basically be nervous the whole time.
I'm not sure if this will sound wrong but now I wish there was a video about Mark's mom - she sounds amazing and inspiring
Best speech ever!
Throwing shade to Elon Musk, you need to quit being a democrat.... Smh
Wow I just learnt so much I play disc golf and that bowser peach is about to help me so much.
Awesome speech and advice. Way to go, Mark. You nailed it.
Ben bernacke was the speaker at MIT when I graduated... zzzzzzz
This speech is actually amazing.
Ha! He truly gets how out of touch these MIT parents are.
Love that speech 🎉
As a stay at home mom who chose raising my kids, I felt seen & honored along with your mother. Thank You Mark for mentioning your mom and acknowledging the great influence she had in your life.
I saw your video in MTI You Tube Channel broth, what amazing word you said to your class mate. I am a Engineer too as you.
The best engineer ever
That was kind of a hard room
Great.
What a narcissist, I love his work but wow. He just went on and on about himself
Crongradultions mark
bora tomar uma
Great speech hopefully you inspired this graduating class to go out and experience life in a meaningful way and bring something to the world
None of us will even be alive by the time he uploads his video.
Mormon Institute of Technology
You did great!
I wish there was a heart button. A thumbs up, doesn't cut it!
Loved this speech! Loved the 3 pieces of advice. Needed to hear this
Mark's got that 3rd grade swaying back and forth speech
Your amazing 🎉
W
wasnt this put out like 2 weeks ago?
Yeah Mark!
he is him
That was a great Ted talk
If Elon  buys it, it probably will be around...
Outstanding, Mark. Lifetime subscriber here.
that was really cool mark.  what a privilege to get to speak at your alma mater for commencement.  what a great speech too!
I got emotional alittle
Best speech ever
1 word: AMAZING!!!
Congrats Mark! Well done! And yes, I've been seeing your youtube videos since that bastard stole your amazon package from your front porch for the 1st time. It's been a long time!  Thanks for those words of encouragement. Sometimes we need to hear them, specially from people we admire the most.👍🎉🎓
My brain keeps trying to prove me wrong 😢
Or if you marry Kanye 💀
Bro even made a boring speech a banger. Loved when the serious science talk music turned on, hilariously awesome. You can tell this dude loves his life and has a passion for everything he does. So cool MIT had him speak, I bet that class will always remember that. Great job!!
this is the first time i find speaches not boring
not graduating from MIT this year, but i believe i will with my masters. cant wait to be in my late fourties early fifties to watch this intro agaian
I wish the A/V Team at MIT had made a version of Mark's music that faded out instead of just dropping away as it does. I don't work for a big-deal University like MIT, but at least the college where I work rents a tent big enough to cover all graduates and their families. ;)
why am i crying omg😊
I just got back from my brother finishing his uni course. It's like the hottest day in Britain at the moment. I unfortunately have a strong negative reflex to long speeches and hot temperatures happening at the same time...I will now pondering why there was no strapping of a flamethrower to your drone hat combination.
I graduated too this week congrats
Even for someone who is not an Engineer and doesn’t want to be one your words hit everyone
wen did you start
As a high school student who is pessimistic, this speech actually made me very optimistic. Thank you so much Mr. Mark!!
well done🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥👍👍
why did you have to reupload this?
So many jokes flew over the crowds head lmao
beat brazzer lol
L crowd tbh, I woulda been fan girlling 😂😂😂😂😂
Can't believe he still refers to "evolution" stuff...
wow thi mit crowd is a tough crowd
Great video!
That was crazy well structured and thought at :O And you said you were nervous of public speeches...
Ya
waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
I wonder how long it took him to memorize a 20 minute speech
love watching his videos
My Inspiration Mark Rober
Your speech was amazing grt job
Thanks Mark for sharing this! You always inspire me. You seem like such a genuinely great guy. Your speech was incredible, but also real with moments of relatable humanity that can be edited out of your normal videos. I felt so much human connection watching you and so much gratitude for your presence on the earth and that you choose to step into the light and shine yours for the world.
nothing else but amazing<3
3:14 I'll be in my late 40s by then, looking forward to it!
Mind blowing 😌🖤🔥
I find it fascinating how you refer to these as commencement speeches rather than graduation speeches when given at a graduation.  Is this an american thing to indicate the commencement of your life long student debt? Also interesting the shortcoming you mention yet claim they are the best school in the world, clearly not.  Just because they say it it, does mean it it...Example of corporate brain washing to justify you life long commencement debt no doubt.
This is the wholesome stuff that makes life worth working for
MIT is bes engineering school on planet??? bruh Mark, try to visit in IIT
While I may not go to MIT, your advice really helped me. I go to LAPC and still have no idea what I am going to major in because I have been trying to find a major in something that I thought I was going to be persuing for the rest of my life until this point. On top of that your videos in general have helped me when I really stress out with homework and I always look forward to when you release your next video. Thank you for your advice once again as it has helped me in more ways than one.
AMAZING
For as long as I can remember i have wanted to be a mechanical engineer, you have cemented that in my mind even further. Thank you for making engineering fun and entertaining for kids and people of all ages. We love you Mark!
This has to rank as one of the best commencement addresses ever. Excellent.
Dear Mark i have seen you some years already and I am happy that you mastered speaking from the heart at 9whatminutes :) You have that thriving pull on others to enjoy failure and that's beautiful! greetings from vienna
who had the idea of having Mark give this speech and can someone give them a raise? if it was Mark himself, then who ever allowed him to do so.
Imagining the videos Mark will be making in 2053 with all the advancements in technology by then is mind blowing!
MIT people clapped like it was a funeral
Inspiring 😊
blud cracked jokes by no one laughed
This will be the second time that I have watched this commencement speech and it is an amazing speech the first time I watched it I watched it straight from MIT's YouTube channel. 4:15
greatness
I watched the MIT release of the speech but Mark is such a great guy here's a comment and I liked the video for support and will play it while I go AFK for the view chart.
Once my middle school science students realized that FAIL means First Attempt In Learning they would always be willing to keep trying until they succeeded.
Congratulations ❤❤❤
Noice Speech. I really like all of the culturally accurate tech-related jokes you slipped in there lol
Before following this sweet naive optimism advice be sure that you graduate from MIT.
Browser
🎉👏👏👏👏👏🎉
YEAH
I aready see this like a week or two
Best commencement speech ever!!!
19:30 best part of the speech
Wow, what a speech
This was a super speech Mark. Those graduates will never forget that day. Full of fun which is what life should always be about.
I’m hanging on every word! You are the PERFECT person to deliver this amazing speech! I love the perspective you bring and also am very grateful for terms you inserted like, “Judo flip it” which totally make sense to me 😁 Completely EPICly done, brother!
Favorite part was when you added the music when you were talking I got be engaged in the speech even though I wasn’t there
goosebumps - so happy for you
This was a super speech Mark.  Those graduates will never forget that day.  Full of fun which is what life should always be about.
Yo let's go!
ยอดเยี่ยมค่ะ ชอบมาก ๆ ตามมาตั้งแต่กลิ๊ตเตอร์บอม ชอบกระรอก บลา ๆ ๆ รอชม VDO ถัดไปค่ะ
Great work Mark! I happy with all your accomplishments. Thank you for the inspiring words!
remember when you rubbed elbows with jeffrey epstein's buddy?
so you surfer from stage fright
Great speak Mark❗
Million views and 77k come on people do better, help the channels you like watching. Give them a like and comment
I love living in Massachusetts ! It gives me so many options for college . I plan on going to Mass Art which is close to MIT
Well done Mark, excellent speech
In 20 years when I run my family's farm I'll be back to prove you wrong
We need Fletcher for this speech
Totally awesome!!! As someone who has personally heard 3 graduation speeches, I cannot remember one of those persons nor a single word they said.....but...I will remember you....and this clip! 😊
Excellent Speech!!!
Genuinely so cool!
NGL 4 minutes in and this is already one of the only graduation speeches that I don't mind listening to.
Mark you just made my day with that speech, I've made a few speeches of my own even though I'm only thirteen, I just want to say that you did AMAZING! 🤩 I really want to be like you when I'm older, please keep making YouTube videos so I can see all the cool things you do.- 🫑 (:
Mark Rober has a HBO max original series called “Revengeineers”.
A TRUE leader to look up to! AMAZING job Mark!!!
This should be #1 on trending.
Will be patiently waiting for 2053 for this to unfold. See you in 30 years.
That was so great! I'm not going into engineering, but your speech was outstanding and I was so glad to have been able to hear it!
I hate public speaking as well and always stutter. One of my college professors told me to “take my training wheels off” ☹️
Beautiful speech.  Many congratulations to you and everyone.
MIT just got 23 million possible applications today 🎉
But it's too bad you're so smart and so nice but believe in a silly theory like evolution.
Congratulations on your speech! And thank you for sharing best three life advice to graduates and us, around the world!
Amazing speech mark getting me excited for graduation next year for my BAS in IT management
My goal in life is to get into MIT so this video is really cool
What an awesome commencement speech! :)
I wanna meet him soo bad
You could have shaved.
Amazing speech Mark! You are an inspiration.
Looks like you did an amazing job, Mark!
Really? A slam on Elon Musk? Mark, I'm disappointed in you. Elon's track record shows he is successful in business
Should do it from the Heart and not of read it you would of done way better but great video
I love everything u do and all of ur jokes! I will surrport u no matter what. Ps I am on m dads acc.   Love ur work❤
Hope you mentioned to the graduates that they should stay away from weird financial advisor types that invite you to trips to their isolated islands.
nocap
The bit about confirmation bias in relationships is so spot on.
Amazing like always
I couldn't believe it when he said 20 years ago. How is he 43??

pov: watching this as a college dropout
"you're gonna get wet" -Mark Rober 2023
Awe missed a chance to Glitter the graduates😂
Nailed it. How did it feel to stick this landing? {^_^}
I just attended a graduation today like a mile away! But this. I can sit through this whole speech and be so entertained.
chaos, chaos, chaos!
His George Carlin quote is one of my all time favorite quotes. I can't believe he used it. Ironically I thought I was the only one who appreciated the brilliance of it.
Your speech was amazing Mark!
Hits hard and who wants to bet the mark wont ever come to my class of 2029 graduation out of high school
Dude loved the speech. Though sometimes it really felt like I was watching Murray from impractical jokers talking whilst having his mouth anesthetized. Who else saw that episode? So I know how many people thought of that too 🤣
"I get nervous in public speaking" -> Absolutely nails it Me: having an heart attack and seizures on the floor as I try to say hello in public -.-
Nailed it, Mark. The music part was gold
I know someone who did this drone hat project for their high school graduation, and this was in 2018…
Mark is one of the only people able to make a very important speech into an entertaining video.
Meanwhile my school held graduation in the pouring rain…
Im actually glad I clicked on this video. Your not only changing MIT's class of 2023's lives. Your changing our lives.
Can we be friends, Mark? I'll buy the beers.
As the bored sibling of a (hopefully) MIT-bound teen, I can only hope for her sake and mine that the class of 2028's guest speaker is even half as inspirational and engaging as you. Thanks for all your humor, wisdom, and advice.
Well done mark
What happens if you pull the "Do not pull" cord?
golden
I wanna be a vet, but this makes me want to be a engineer. Nice speech 🤣! So funny
Such an amazing speech, it interested me a lot
id just like to say i saw the first part of this on my day of graduation and i clicked off before watching the part that i needed to hear - im glad i came back cuz you actually reframed my college experience in a way i do feel more proud of. I was so focused on the struggles i had I didn't let myself celebrate the fact i completed the level nonetheless. I may not have gotten 3 stars or whatever but I still did it and that feels a lot better than not finishing it
Well done, Mark
Awesome sir. Just awesome!
Congrats, bro!🔥🔥🔥
🎉Best of luck to all the graduates, can’t wait to see the update in 30 years!
The perfect blend of speech and engineering. I love it.
Hands down, this was the best speech I have ever heard from anyone. Amazing job Mark. It was funny, inspirational and gave me peace of mind for when I graduate my dream college.
Great video Great speech
That was actually really impressive... 👍
When you said what you love to do on a summer day, I thought you were about to say the phineas and ferb theme song.
Day 50 of Mark Rober using AI to edit his audio and videos
I'm not a student at mit but this inspired me non the less.  Thankyou mark
Nailed it. Bravo. ☺
3:43 Unless Disney buys it first
Terry here xd😅Rhondda
Great speech!  And of course, loved the ending.

Hey! That was better than Joe Biden's! :)) ok, lot of room there. It was actually the best commencement speech, and stuff, I've ever seen.
They should have asked Mark for help building the awning. He knows something about casting shade.
Great advice. Very inspiring and practical. I’m much older than the graduates but still learned from this speech. TY
what a lucky year for that class of 2023 having mark come to their graduation
We love you Mark ♥️
i dont get the part with the drone
Bro when the music started playing I lost it 🤣
The speech made me so inspired I actually clapped with them lol
hes just roasting the school at the star
Kudos Mark...making an impact on others is the most prestigious thing a human can do.
As an engineer student.. this motivated me soo freking much
i hate how they arent laughing at his jokes
Wow, I feel like I just graduated!
Congratulations mark, on this!
Lol nice
I could listen to Mark talk about life forever. He is an amazing human that exposes all ages to success. He has really motivated me to become an engineer myself and I couldn’t be happier with my decision and the never ending possibilities I can do with my degree. Thank you Mark for everything and I look forward to the continuous videos and motivation to come❤️
Beautifully done, Mark. Great speech, enjoyed every bit of it.Very original and so NOT boring!
as MIT was fast as rocket science and uploaded the video 9 days ago i was one of the first 3 million viewers who already saw your awesome speech because clicking on a title with "mark rober" in it is an absolut no brainer.
That speech 👏👏👏
Hello me after 30 year
You made a f$&@ing mockery of this.
Already watched it on MIT's channel, but of course I had to watch it again :)
I thought it was going to explode or something into the air with elephant toothpaste.. I was let down by him just attaching it to a drone.
What's incredible to me about Mark is his confidence to give this speech. He teased himself, famous people, and MIT at several points throughout. The amount of allusions in this speech ensured that everyone would resonate with it in at least one way. The humility he showed and down to earthness(Is that a word?) showed his human side which is really cool to see. That is true confidence in my opinion, and I hope the MIT graduates and everyone listening to it can bring some of this confidence into their lives to make the world a better, non-judgmental place.
Great job mark! The addition of the music was a great idea.
I gotta say though, Mark, *you clean up nicely!* You look great!
watched on the mit channel days ago, but Mark just got that charm to bait me in once again
Can't imagine how inspired those grads felt hearing this live 🖤 I'm not crying you are.
AMAZING🎉😅
I cried.
The real question is how he got the hat back
tldw
And they never stoped clapping since then
can you figure out the aerodynamics of a pokeball?
I bettee watched the video on june 2053
Job well done.
"its not a bug its a feature" is just star citizen
Awesome!
Awesome
Cool
I think its really funny mit grads are this shocked from what is essentially a drone
a
At 11:00, those in the audience saying,  what does level 8-1 mean??? But those of us who've been in the workforce for 20 years know exactly what he's referring to.
Mark made the best speech ever!! 🙂
yeah mark :)
Companies love using point systems to punish employees now and days.
Wow, well done sir.
Well done.
BbBbBbBboring
Unless Elon buys it? Just stay in your comfortable zone, you nerds are not very smart in politics.
Imagine just walking down the street and you see a flying graduation hat. Nothing to see here, just a flying hat!
I feel like mark is the youtuber everyone just watches
I hope nurk was in control of that hat
My sister should got a better speech yesterday
This does not change the fact that Mark Rober has to eat a basketball
This is the first time ever that I actually listen through the whole entire speech.
Quit watching at, "unless Elon buys it".  For such an intelligent guy, you haven't realized much.
Watching this gave me so much more respect for ANYONE that regularly engages in poublic speaking. I'm sure it gets easier but its much harder than I imagined. I couldnt have done this. Mark you are an inspiration. Congratulations to you and the MIT class of 23. Lets pray they can save us from 😂
CONGRATS MARK! Always amazing to have a professional and teacher like you do this kind of thing.
Gonna have to wait until I'm 45 to watch this video. Can't wait.
Well done, Mark. Having worked at a major University for almost 30 years I've been to hundreds of graduations. This is one of the best I've ever heard.
I love your Videos
mark rober is the greatest
The last bit reminds me of DFW This is Water 💗
Hi 3 years from now (if we make it that is)
Best commencement speech, ever!
Awesome :) lex fridman next
Mark flying the cap reminds me of Harry Potter...
Thank you Mark; I was there with my parents, Your speech was hilarious to them ❤
can we see chopsticks again? playerless piano! (in a nice way)
Now the real question… did Mark catch the hat?
Well done!
I already watched this on Mit's channel though...
Mark is one of the most influential persons. This guy deserves a humanitarian award.
You are a great speaker, i love that you learned how to deal with your problems and engineered a way to make this more confortable for you. Love your videos!
Oh, Mark Rober. I just love you. Thanks for being a light in the world.
wowow, i wanted to go there
This is great, I’m a kid and I want to be a NASA engineer because of you. I do public speaking, and won the public speaking contest in my school, learning community, and got third place in the district. I then made the keynote speech at my 5th grade graduation. I love everything you do and this really inspired me. Thank you.
W MARK
was mr beast  cheerin you on
Weird to think back in 1930 something my grandpa sat down there just as all those other people did
Everything this guy does is cool!
Marcus roboticus, yeeees
i love when he turned on his background music
Awesome speech!
Mark I expect you to complete that video many years from now 😁
i get allergies kick-in just by watchinbg this video :D
Great job of getting over your fear of public speaking!!
Pretty cool Rober, well played 😁
love this dude's style, what a freakin' legend 😂
17:50 A REVIEW OF THE LEGENDARY PRINCIPLES
Extraordinary speech mark I loved every second of watching this really terrific job at it and props to you for going out of your comfort zone great job.
Great speech Mark.  Lots of stuff for everyone to consider in life.
as we Mexicans say, eres un chingón, Mark!
WOW, it was amazing 😄
so funny 🤣
The music helped me pay attention to the important parts 😂
Now we have build up for a 30 year video in the making
Hi
Thanks you for sharing this helpful advice to the world and not just to the prestigious MIT
Great job!
I'm such a huge fan of you, and this is a huge step to me in your life. Keep it up, Mark.
Well that was the most inspiring speech I've ever heard
Lol this was the only speech I listened from beginning to end 😂
W speech
2 years from now: today I will be engineering a way to become the US president
Congrats you deserved it ! And i gotta say: I'm pretty sure its the same for other people but all of the projects you make give me the strength to continue towards my goal, i just finished my highschool years in a high school thats focused in engineering and informatic, i'm entering my Higher Education phase in september in an establishment that is also focused on a bit of engineering and informatic but also other stuff like the embed systems. I know this round really cliché but again i just want to say "Thank you" watching your vids give me the strength to keep going forward and never give up.
Loved the opening of your speach
Im terified of public speaking
Top end speech! Great work!
Fantastic words of advice!
One item you might of added Mark and it's one thing that I found in my 70 years of life, Never consider criticism from someone you wouldn't ask advice from,
ну такое себе . дичь какая то !
Woooow , what a gigantic honor !!!
Let's be kind to Kanye
Nice job! Must of been a cool experience for you and definitely a memorable one for every grad there.
Well done sir.. You're no Steve Jobs when it comes to commencement speeches.. You're a close second.
Im very happy to hear Mark Rober quote georgy
So much respect for putting yourself out there!
2 uploads in a month???
It's interesting how for some people they are much more comfortable talking to a camera than a crowd, and for others it's the opposite.
Wow I learnt alot from this😊 never thought I would watch the video till the end
Mark, we are all still waiting to watch you eat a basketball. Don’t think we didn’t watch the dude perfect video and all of a sudden forget due to you magical speech of wisdom you gave to MIT.
gigachad
With only a high school diploma, I worked as an engineer in Industrial automation, I was a teaching assistant at McGill University for 3 years. I jumped those slippery rocks through the river. It does work, Mark is smart. I like your speech.
That was awesome!  Advice we all need to hear!
Come to Dartmouth in 2025!!!
An incredible speech with incredible points that can literally be applied in all walks of life. Well done sir!
Bro made a video on the spot
Great speech Mark
Briliiant!
Nice
Mark sounds so much more awesome when the music kicks in.
Working as an engineer in the real worl is hard. But i always come back to Mark to remember myself why I choose this career and to remember to have fun with it. It is fitting to have Mark give this speach, great inspiration going forward. Engineer need this.
Can't wait for a new Mark Roger video in my 40s!.. and when I become an actual engineer.
That. Is amazing. Congratulations you've made it so far in this over a decade journey.
Mark basically: “Because they didn’t, I did”
Tough crowd
Mark looks truly uncomfortable... I don't mean it in a bad way, just comes to show that he really stepped out of his comfort zone. Really cool
only OGs know onemeeeliondollars really gave the MIT commencement speech
Honestly it’s kind of refreshing to see you a little off balance and natural, your videos are usually so slick and well-produced. Not that that’s a bad thing. 😊
Where's the test/quiz?
Professional Rizzicist
i dont know if i watched a motivational speech or stand-up comedy
this is the only speech i willingly wanted to hear
thats just a normal fpv drone running what looks like the dji fpv system
Better than any politician or bureaucrat, by far.
Bad time to mention but you still have to eat a basket ball😂😂
Errrrr 🤡
2:36 Trading a Picasso for a stoned monkey NFT 💀💀bruh I'm dead
i graduated from mit and missed out
The music! lol this humanized you so much. Thanks for the humility and vulnerability. This was great.
2 videos in one month crazy!!
Looking forward to this banger of a collaboration.
Back in 1980, I got rejected by MIT!  Still bummed by that.  Had to attend Cornell.  Great commencement speech!  :)
Great speech mark
A++ one heck of a speech. Very interesting, entertaining, and educational.  Love it. ❤
Gawd, those graduates have very little sense of Humor !!
Mark, very, very impressed by this speech. It heavily powers faith and leads a way into the future for the whole croud. It is by far the best speech I've heard. It's printed in the mind for a lifetime, like the squirrels and their parcours. 👏
"Timeout, this is a perfect moment to review what we have talked about" - literally Mark in every single video he has made
Wow …. Just wow 😯 well done !
NO WAY, EARLY VID??!!"!"!
Mark,  You are late. We already saw your perform. It is great and awesome. 😂
Wait time out … This video is sponsored by Dragon City…..
Mark my words
Who else loves the part when Mark turns on his usual music for his vids? 😂  Also, great job! I found this really inspiring and congrats to the graduating seniors! I want to go to MIT some day! :)
I F***ING CALLED IT!
I thought you were going to take your hat off and throw it and it was going to fly away. Guess not.
wow
almost thought you were going to plagiarize David Foster Wallace's commencement speech ("this is water") with that example about not getting mad at people on the road
*Wait this whole video is him talking?! Dang I thought he’d explain how he made the flying cap but like wow…*
I love your videos ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
W speech
You wont believe it my brain implanted the music you always use just naturally I started whistling it and jamming out to it in my head during your speech   So so funny wondering if im not the only one to do so
Hey mark, do you got any tips to get into MIT? I’ve always wanted to learn there and become somewhat like you.
Mark is such an inspiration... even to non-engineers
I watched your speech soon after it was released, and it was one of the best I have heard so far. Your advice was great for the occasion and was well-built in terms of flow.
only in america you need gun protection at an university speech
One of the best speeches I’ve ever witnessed
Crossing the river one rock at a time is a great metaphor.  I'm now retired and started out not knowing where the river was. I am reminded of a quote commonly attributed to Yogi Berra: "When you come to a fork in the road, take it."
ChatGPT really nailed this speech! Great job, Mark!
Me waiting for the two microphones to lign up with the Symbols on badge 😫
How
When are you going to eat the basketball?
absolute banger of a video, as always
I hope I remember to come back to this in 30 years. Seeing as how that's farther away than I've been alive it's impossible to comprehend. But if I'm still alive and I see this comment I hope everything turned out at least ok, at least better than things are now...
The hat just sent off to space ig
Hey siri, set a reminder for June 2053
Awesome speech
That was boring af.
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
13:04 niiice
You need to do a video on the science of chocolate. I’m open to have you come to our chocolate kitchen and do a video!  It’s a really fun and cool subject!!
Bro your way better at this than Joe Biden !
Watched this on the MIT channel. So awesome!  Congrats on being able to do something so HUGE!!
4 rules for all to live by!
He's got to be the nicest guy on YouTube, or the universe.
Who’s cutting onions?
such simple, pragmatic advice.  RISE AND SHOUT !
ngl, i actually like this video more than the previous 5-6 videos he made on this channel.
Best speech ever 👍
I graduated from University of Georgia and they picked ryan seacrest who gave a speech about how we were suckers for going to college lol Mark's speech on the other hand was great
What's super mario brothers? Haha jk. Just imagine being that confused.
4:35 chills every time I swear
Mark Rober, you are a freaking star. Standing ovation for your dear mother, nicely done!
I missed my UG Convocation 🎓  got emotional after seeing this video ❤.
🎶MIT you smell me🎶
Slam dunk!! You took your own advice and persevered in your speech, even when you feared mistakes. You went for it. That alone, if no one picked up on anything else, was a triumph.
🥱 😴😴😴😴😴 yawn 🥱🥱 I 😴😴😴😴😴
you said that in June 2053 you will make a collab with everyone. Can you make it on June 15, because it's my birthday. also very great speech
MIT class of ‘24 here- never have I been so jealous of my seniors. thanks for the amazing speech and i’ve got my fingers crossed that maybe you can include a couple of us younger generations in the back of your mind ;))
That was the best speech I’ve ever heard
I am going to be honest, i watch the speech already.
Wow. What a speech!
Hi
MARK ROBER IS THE MOST COOLEST PERSON IN THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE
Mark should do standup comedy
Monthly videos my a-hole
Why do these speeches have to be so long ridiculous
Balls
Yesterday I had a little sister and this is really inspiring to try so hard even though I might hard to try new thing this is so inspiring Mark , Thank You
Now that was an amazing speech, super dry audience though :/
Siri, set a reminder for 30 years.
I am currently planning on going to MIT, In a couple years since I am still 13, But thank to mark Rober, He has made me want to be an engineer.
The Resonance 🥹🥹
I 💭 I already saw this?
Truly inspiring
Wow ! Nice speech Mark.
👍
do berkeley in 2027 please
nice speech
I think I'll  hold on to those advices
He is an outstanding engineer
woaw
i can't believe you had a plastic water bottle with you. just kidding you're great mark
This was epic. And your mother’s  influence may have started as ripples but has developed in to tidal waves. This brought back so many memories of my university graduation with a not so spirit boosting speech. My husband and I love your channel and now my daughter loves it thanks to the Adley colab.
Great speech Mark!
I could feel your nerves, but way to go with pushing through, and congrats for the standing O!
I’ve been seeing this on the MIT channel since like a week ago
We were able to stream this live. Legendary moment, something I will never forget. Mark is the perfect person to give the commencement speech at MIT.
Awesome speech 👏. Now, Squirrel maze 4.0! 😆😎
One of the few commencement speeches I will listen to again!👍
Thank you so much for sharing, def gonna share this one with my students and with myself every now and then, great advice!
GO UC BERKELEY!
I recently watched Mark’s speech for the second time and found it even more engaging than the first time. I enjoyed it so much that I downloaded the video, shared it with my friends and family, saved it in my playlist and liked it.
As a teacher and a parent, I am so grateful for what you do, Mark. You are inspiring the next generation(s) of engineers. Please keep persevering through hardship and putting your whole heart into what you do. It's working. You are making a tremendous positive impact.
So we have to wait 30 years for the next video?
❤ Awesome and inspiring, especially for future Engineers!👩‍🔧
Boy, such simple life lessons, but delivered so meaningfully. You're amazing Mark - simply and truly great!🤝
This video had me in tears.
I was in the crowd, everyone loved this speech! I even got a picture with Mark, super nice guy!
YUM!
"how am I going to break it to Luigi" 🤭🤩
That is nice.
Wait, didn’t you just a video!
Amazing speek, Mark, really great words and advice! :-)
bro is talking motivational speech but I'm here about to drop out this cage who puts pressure on my life only for a piece of paper with a grade XD
2 videos within a month 😮. What is this??
I love how Americans really think MIT is the best engineering school in the world, while none of the USA schools are in the 10 anymore for a longtime. Keep putting narratives above science USA. We will send aid very soon.
You are a fraud, and will be exposed as such.
You may have been uncomfortable/nervous with your speech; however, the results are excellent.
FANTASTIC!
You made me laugh, you made me cry, you made me think. Well done.
4:50 🪧
That was the most life changing advice packed into a video, now onto applying it!
This is cool for me, because I want to go to MIT when I grow up.
Amazing speech!
i have no problem with speeches i was the 1st place winner of the tropicannia speech conetest
I was expecting the cap to do a circle and then land precisely back on his head!
i was here
He graduated tho
Yea, brains.
Heck of a speech!
woaw, what a speech!!
Alrdy saw the speach and gotta say it was amazing!
Best Speech it's funny he brought the music with him
He’s sus
3 great principles.
I smiled the whole time. Beautiful and inspirational !
Wow, Mark gave a new meaning to the term 'propeller head'!!
Mark Freakin Rober at M. I. freakin T.
Best speech ever...! 🍻👍😎🤯🎊🎉🇺🇸🌞
so see you in 30
I just feel lost
Hey Mark....this boomer has been watching your videos for years....and introduced grandson to them.
L
This was one heck of a speech!
I don't know how to explain this but, idk why but I just can't stop worrying about what's gonna happen to me, like I really love playing video games and I've wanted to a youtube since a kid but idk what to do, and I also want to make my dad happy and also learn how to code , but I keep on not doing that because I'm just playing video games and well I can't stop :(, so do I keep on trusting my self or try to do it now?
Nice inspirational speech Mark! You are the best choice of the MIT for the purpose.
Great job!  Instilled confidence with humility in the grads along with the realization they must start with one step onto the first rock but with vigor and enthusiasm.   Your examples throught were very relatable even to this 70yo.
Thank you very much, Mark.  As a college student still naive about the challenges of the world, I'm still unaware of what I can do for the world and for myself in the future. Still confused on what the reason was for my existence and/or sometimes, why I'm bored at life itself. My vision for my future was selfish. I had no idea that there's so much people looking for solutions that can help not only themselves, but also other people and the world itself.  Once again, thank you very much Mark for the valuable lesson and advice. It resonated with me and gave me hope for what I can do to help the world and not just myself in the future as an IT student.   Please take care of yourself because we need a role model like you who keeps the motivation even thought it's only 1/3 of an hour every few months!   Also, congratulations to everyone!
Here before 600k views
Wow what an epic speech.  This was incredible.
wow...  Just amazing...
I seriously love this channel. So wholesome, educational, and entertaining. Thank you Mark for what you do
This speech made me cry so bad. Mark, you rock!!!
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🙌🏻 Great speech!
This was a pretty powerful speech. Thanks.
Great job Mark! Entertaining, inspiring, funny, real and I love the flying mortarboard!! Congrats to MIT Class of 2023! I hope you all are half as successful in life as Mark!
I think that this was the best commencement speech ever. Well done. 👏
As an engineering student, seeing this has rejuvenated my love for the field.
The speech was already fantastic but once that music started playing you knew you were in for a treat
why do american students wearing such ridiculous robes?
The music is gold 😂
congrats mark! you nailed it. ^_^
My brother graduated for M.I.T. this is a fantastic new change of speech to the next generation. You nailed it.
❤
hi mark today is my birthday
Great speech! This makes me hopeful for a future where 98% of commencement speeches don't start with "Webster's dictionary defines whatever as..."
Im not graduating from MIT this year, im going to graduating next year from college and This speech was something else, it spoke to me very well, and I just wanna say thank you for the amazing words and I look forward to my last year of college with a new mindset
You inspire me Mark Rober
I want to go to mit
"Playful anarchy", probably the best piece of advice I'v ever heard and this is the best exemple...
how?! How did you manage to get this speech approved xDD
I don't understand, where's fat Guss?! 🐿 * beautiful speech !
I would imagine all of those listening to the fossils in our government give their commencement speeches wish they could have changed places with these graduates.  Congrats to the class of 2023, now go make the world a better place!
I am SO Jealous…. Wished I was there .. I want to be Mark Rober someday
Legend
"I Believe I Can Fly"
i think this is the least edited Mark Rober video ever
Watching anime and reading manga is always so exhilarating.
tbh anit climatic
This might be the greatest speech I’ve heard or seen
Thank you Mark, I found the Speech valuable even I graduated from university 5 years ago. Those advises are meaningful in every stages of life.
Half of the words I can’t understand 😅
I'm getting my masters in a few years... how do I get you to come to commencement because holy moly... AMAZING!
It's all great until when you fail once, you're terminated. Then as you continue to try to get back on your feet, you watch as your successor fails for 3 successive years in a row, they're defended and protected.  They never tell you that they always effort to secure failure, not success. Why? Because failures are less likely to identify them as the failure that they are as well.  Fear rules the systems, even YouTube.
That “confused pets” line at the beginning was criminally underrated. Super funny.
Bruh AP Lang is gonna be giving this speech to students in 30 years at this rate 💀
❤
lol
This actually came out on mits channel first. Its a must watch speech and video ... youll see the best of the best reactions.
Yes
Thanks!
No bigger Mark Rober fan than Mark Rober.
You're a damned Rock Star!  Keep it up!
now this I did not expect for a video holy
bro the part when he played the music LOL
Nice job! Used a bit of time to appeal to every generation, and I think it worked.
Amazing, this is how all commencement speeches should be A Political and instead about making life better
Thats a freaking life speech. So much appreciation for your work mark. May you fly high and outrun more squirrels. 😅
I feel like this speech isn't only for MIT it speaks for all of us to strive for more greatness comes after the battle
I don't know why I'm imagining a rivalry between  you and Brandon Sanderson. But if there is one you absolutely destroyed him here. His commencement speech at Utah Valley definitely did not have a flying hat.
Best Graduation Speech Ever!
That was an amazing send off at the end
I have. I've seen it many times  now 😅....it was amazing
Yes sir.... love it!
Hello mark, I was that one confused pet in that comment speech at MIT. I was very confused but the speech you gave was very inspiring. I bet that the entirety of Gen Z or any other generation might have picked up a thing or two from that amazing speech. Thank you for inspiring our childhoods and us confused pets.
woaw that’s a lot of asians
Buzz didn’t land on the moon
4min 35 instantly hit the like 🙂
Your creativity with even the most mundane tasks inspired me to take risks and find out more about myself, so for that, I would like to thank you🤩
I want to see joe biden give this speech
How did Mark remember all that, I am still shocked 😂
Hope I'll be there one day...
Nice that you got to give the Graduation speech at The Georgia Tech of the North. Go Jackets!
Yea, id probably have a better mentality about work, and the challenges along the way had I heard this when I was younger.  Solid speech.
I think that the speech is not specifically for engineering student but for everyone!
That was a great speech and I will be surprissed if it doesnt show up in the list of best speeches.
We need to see the full footage of the drone flight
Mark Rober playing Mark Rober music during his Mark Rober's commitment speech is the most Mark Robering Mark Rober I have ever seen Mark Rober.
only mark can play andrew applepie in the middle of his commencement speech without losing everyone
hi
Thank you!
Great speech. Congratulations for getting the honor of giving the Commencement Speech.
Mark is truly such an amazing soul ❤️
Well Done Mark!🔥😂🔥
They could not have chosen a better person to give that speech. I am so happy for you!
Congratulation🎉 your new day 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤
Leaving a comment, maybe 30 years later I'll find it.
Let's see if I can remember the 3 pieces of advice. 1. Go through life with naive optimism 2. Learn from your mistakes? Frame your mistakes? 3. Leverage confirmation bias to foster healthy relationships
I remember hearing this Super Mario analogy a few years back during your Ted Talk. Thanks for reminding me of it, it's something I needed today :)
Incredible
Who was flying the drone? 😅 AI?
That Elon stab was gold.
Thank you Mark  I only graduated from highschool just now, but even this early on, your advice nailed it on point
I'm not crying you're crying
"I beat Browser last night"
Isn't this a re-upload-
One of the best speeches I have ever heard!!! Excellent job Mark
Great example of facing your fears!
Well Done Mark! Point three is life changing.
It’s so nice to see Mark getting the recognition he deserves!
Great speech but did your hat come back?🤣
This applies to a 7th grader just as much as a 2023 grad. Great work Mark!
Graduating from MIT is already amazing, but having Mark Rober give the commencement speech is the cherry on top.
WoW
LOVE that speech!!!
Couldn't he mention his worked for nasa?!?! This man's ego is unbelievable
i saw this vid but by MIT themselves
Great speech, Mark!
that was excellent.  gave me goosebumps.
That was an absolutely beautiful speech with great metaphors and advice. The delivery was flawless as well I actually shed a tear
Can you give speeches for more schools? xD
You still have to eat a basketball though!
Mark you are an inspiration. ❤❤❤❤❤
Learn from the failures don’t focus on them. This speaks to me, and is a difficult ask. 🤔
Love that it was a frame by Shen Drones.
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Confused pets?
If there’s an award for most inspiring individual you deserve it, Mark, through all of your work whether intentional or not you instill curiosity and a passion for impacting the world into everyone who watches and listens to you.
Pretty basic speech, but no one will remember or care in about 2 weeks anyway
Hey, hats off to this guy
Great speech with relevant stories but the grads just seems kinda lof blah. I would have been stoked and cheering every point he made.
Well done!!  Great advice!!
Mark did a fantastic job despite claiming he was nervous.
goddamn, you’re an amazing public speaker dude. Bravo.
thanks as if i needed another reason to feel inadequate
Mark is a great public speaker. But you can absolutely see the nerves with how  much hes licking his lips.
This is not a just a coincidence one of if not the most important video on your channel is the 117  (Halo music intensifies)
Buzz Aldrin 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Who's here after already have watched the speech on MIT channel
SO INSPIRING
i love this :D
Am I the only one who wanted that hat to explode in the air?
Why am I crying
Amazing speech. I didn't go to MIT but I feel ready to change the world myself
It makes me so mad, all those people in the audience not even cracking a smile at Mark's jokes
yo
Did Mark just pull a Leonardo DiCaprio on us at the end?
17:52 Time out, it's actually a great opportunity to bring out today's sponsor skill share...
Already saw this at MITs channel.  Never before was there a better speaker to a given audience.
The one of the present time engineers, that i want to meet so badly 🙆
Favorite video ever
or the little blue pill is about to wear off
He went from teaching party tricks to giving public speeches at the most prestigious School and University, Well earned and well Deserved Mark :)
Bro, I’m not watching an entire speech lol. Looks like you did well with the public speaking though. Happy for you. They say some people fear public speaking more than death.
Am I The Only Person That Gets Hyped Whenever Mark Uploads A Video?❤
Mark for president ?
when was this coding puzzle? I wish I was a part of it.
I really want to meet Mark one day ❤❤
Beautiful!💛
Great speech, great advice. 👏👏
nice ee
the music was 5 seconds long lol
Some of the best life advice! Got me excited for the day!😂
this is indeed on brug
Great video ! I really liked this super inspiring!
So amazing <3
10:29 wait the guy in the audience there looks like the thief from home alone. (the guy with the gold tooth)
Congrats!
You're so amazing and loveable ❤ keep the videos coming please 🙏❤
Great speech!
Great speech, I am an engineer, but I think it resonates with anyone who hears the speech,  Congratulations!
It's kinda awkward when you can't hear the crowd laughing because there aren't any microphones in the crowd
I've already watched this hehehe
Well done, Sir.  Well done
The first youtuber to have his iconic background music live on a public speach. Truly a legend. :D
Hey Mark, I just want to thank you for the advice you have given to all of us. Your channel is so inspiring to me!
This comment will remain undiscovered
thank you so much Mark for uploading this video ❤
mark...I am not a MITian...and I don't think I can be in one...I haven't started my graduation yet...but still... still I will make it through and change the world for the better...will I will be featured in the video... or is this opportunity is only for the so special MIT graduates ?
Great speech, great job putting yourself out there. Best of all, THANK YOU for your third point. We need that mindset so much more than ever before. Great job sir!!
Awesome, thank you Mark
no im not crying
Cool speech bro!
I wished your flying mortarboard dispensed glitter as it flew, making the event even more fabulous.
Bro put on his background music irl 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
The watch time will be crazy low on this video.
1- Naive Optimism: try new things and approach them from a fresh first principles approach.  2- Learn from mistakes and try something different.  3- Fostering relationships use confirmation technique to find evidences about other friends and fellows goods.  Noted :). Great video btw!
As an actual YouTube watcher…this was the perfect example of facing your fears and letting the world see it unfold.  Thanks for sharing!
👏👍
i love ur vids and have subbed like 5/6 times
I just did NASA moonshot. One thing I learned is to leave the comfort zone.
Mark literally wrote a small motivational speaker book for this. I'll wait for the hard cover😄
That was amazing
I just feel bad for whoever has to follow this on next year's speech.
Love every bit of the points you made ❤
He walks to a different drummer, and is true to himself. My spouse had TWO degrees from MIT and treasured his contacts made throughout his long career.....although he died six years ago this month, I am a big fan of MIT.
Hello everyone
This is just Mark paraphrasing his own TedTalk on the 'Super Mario Effect'
That was a banger of a speech
your jokes were funny ... keep in mind this is MIT ... some of the people there lack humor
bro pulled out the background music 💀
Oh the pain! I'm MIT 2025, off by just two years. Great video Mark and I love your channel and am so happy you gave this year's commencement speech!
huh
Amazing and Inspirational Mark!
insanely fire
this would suck
Damm that was dope. 😃
11:04 "they sting real bad" should be "they sting really badly"
Already watched the whole thing last week from MITs channel.
Wow. Fantastic presentation and worthwhile insights in an era of change on a scale that only grows. You are a voice for our time, Mark.  Bravo.
You should do a collaboration with the Hacksmith!
Great speech, loved the metaphors AND the music! So glad you were chosen for this. Congrats!!
Very cool.
Congrats, you deserve it =)
a great video
This speech need to be given at high school graduation the earlier you realize these key life lessons the easier it will be and the better you will feel about failing and find success! I sent this to all young people I could. A bit of golden information I didn’t expect, but why not it’s mark, he’s a genius above technology!
he hit the Mark 😉🎯🎯🎯
I was expecting the Super Mario 64 credits music in the end  Amazing speech :D
how is Ye gonna respond to this
Again
you know he died to the pit a lot when he was explaining super mario
I chuckled at his "explain to your parents later" comment. Ironically, I've been following Mark for years, and I'm probably closer to the age of some of the grads' GRANDparents than their parents.
What a graduation speech!
Well deserved speaker for this audience!
It won't take 30 years for some of them.
Dang Mark is such an amazing public speaker if I were him I would probably mess up every word I would say. 😅
hats off to you Mark, seriously such a great speech!! never follow the rules when you can forge your own path of fun like that!!!
Amazing. Everyone needs to hear this
Big halls
That was amazing.
As an FPV enthusiast, I would have loved to dive that building. Should've went with a cinewhoop to get close to buildings and people. Y'all'ready skirting the abcs but flying it over decorations before going over the building. Love the idea from a 107 stand point. And love the speech overall, I'm not in mit but hopefully before 2053 I can inspire a video of yours 😅
i just passed my collage public speaking class, and it made me a better speaker, and i didn't like public speaking until that class
👏👏
Woah
What an opening for the speech
This is just what I needed.❤
"it's not a bug, it's a feature". Great tshirt or bumper sticker quote! Just great reminder. Life is all about using our brain to see it in a way that makes us excited about it
Such an inspirational speech❤
Those MIT professors look like they are dressed to teach at Hogworts.
cute
I love this dude. Just so full of life. A friend everyone would love to have. Cheers 💪
I watched it and i could tell that cotton mouth was real
How lucky to have Mark do this speech instead of Kamala😅
Great speech!
Can u get me a scholarship here so I can become an aerospace engineer
Mark fr just made such a graduation speech into a youtube video
Mark can I have a cookie?
It would have been epic if it crashed towards the building 😂
Some say the hat is still flying…
Nice
i felt like im with one of those graduates!
What an ending. The perfect ending for the graduates of MIT
I am terrible at public speaking
Elon Musk buying YouTube would make it more likely it will be here in 20 years, not less.
“Hopefully….unless Elon buys it!!”  😂😂😂😂😂  It’s funny because Elon will probably be bankrupt in 5 years…..either that, or he will swindle a couple more billion out of the American people for his scams.
15:50 this is literally all I think about when I’m driving and I never even realized it 😂
zero charisma, shocking that they chose Mark over a celebrity or politician or something.
For someone who gets nervous public speaking, you spanked it
I have so much gratitude for you Mark! You're one of the most inspirational dudes in my world. I actually want to do your kids engineering stuff... You should create a section for adults... Or I just do the kid stuff!
What a coincidence that this is posted today, I graduate highschool today
See you in '53!!
I can only imagine how cool it must have been to have Mark Rober give a speech at your graduation.
Mark Rober
i was here
he nailed it
AWESOME
That was a super great speech and very inspirational
Now how did you plan this video in advance 😂. You planned MIT will invite me 5 years from now, so let's put it in my life long plan of YouTube videos
They made a great choice in speaker. You memorized the entire thing An effectively poignantly informative, yet truly entertaining speech. Bravo!
YES
This is just legendary. No other words to describe this.
🎉it was great🎉
I was There Mark!!! you did AMAZING!!!!!
Great job
I'm sorry mark, I already watched this at the mit channel...
Hahaha… brilliant speech…
Confirmation vibes.  It is the best advice.  The negative feedback loop can ruin a person.
As an engineering graduate myself, this speech was so inspiring to strive for more than what is expected, and to push boundaries, although I may not be one of those MIT graduates you have addressed in this video to return in 30 years and celebrate what they have achieved, this video has inspired me to learn more and chase mastery over competency so that I myself can look back on my career in 30 years and be proud of what I have achieved. Thank you Mark for everything you do,  please continue to educate and inspire.
4:13 I swear I thought he's gonna say: this video was sponsored by skillshare 🤣.
to the next generation of Asian and women engineers !!!!
Amazing, keep inspiring ❤🇨🇦🌎 Congratulations Graduation MIT Class 2023
I couldn't think of a more deserving person to give this speech. Congratulations Mark!
I aint listening to allat🤑🗣🗣(jk i watched till 18 minutes
Great Speech, MIT put it out on their channel as well. Truly Inspirational and void of hollow anecdotes from the usual cast of Celebs who have never walked in the shoes of those they are addressing!
I was there and that was so cool i could see you in real life. You are very funny too!
gud speach whatched the whole tjing
Noticed the swaying the side to side from being nervous. But nailed it Rober style!
Stand up guy. Do you still do classes?
I'm from México, I am 58 and I love your videos, your personality, your love for your family (including nephews) and the things you do to make a better world. And now this. WOW. Thankyou very much.
That was so cool!!!
Thanks for reminding me. I am overdue to go listen to DFW "This is Water" speech again
Mark "National Treasure" Rober
I WAS THERE
this was really fun to watch, must have been even better to witness.
Let’s gooo ! Love the speech and positivity 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Mark: literaslly has a channel that is watched by 24 million people Also Mark: is scared shitless to talk to a crowd of 200 people...
What a great speech that gives different meaning in each course's we choose choose. I me as a fresh graduate last 7 hours ago PH time. Hahahaha... Thanks to the speech Sir Mark😊😊😊
Nice work! Your a legand!!!!👍🏻👍🏻
Shouldn't the title read  I gave the 2023 MIT ....?
UGHHHHHH I NEED TO WAIT TILL 2053!?!? WHY YOU DO ME LIKE THAT im already dying tired of waiting for 2053 because of you :'D LEGENDARY IDEA
Awsome!
Thank you so much for the inspiration mark, I got what will lead up to my dream job this week. Got a apprenticeship to learn cnc mills to make prototype medical machines, I'm so excited. Wanted to give my thanks to you and your amazing videos that had inspired me
Legendary stuff really
Got to see this in person in the first row (19:21) as a now MIT graduate! You did so well Mark! Thanks for an amazing, unforgettable speech :))
Wonderful speech! Humor and inspiration, congratulations!
I am early
Amazing speech. Felt it. 😊🥺
i saw the full video from mit before this lol
This applies for more than MIT.  Thank you Mark ❤
Hello Mark, you probably wont see this but im graduating from Highschool today. I've been waiting for this day since i entered the 9th grade and you and your videos have been with me since 8th grade. I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for making such interesting and entertaining videos. I'm not trying to become an engineer but seeing your videos and the way you build things light up my natural curiosity. You're the best and thank you
wow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
For those who are wondering, MIT posted his speech a few days ago. Thats why some may be saying they have already seen it.
Last Wednesday i, by pure accident, found an MIT data science course and applied for it. I would have never imagined that within 36 hours i would have been accepted.  Now this speech has given me more inspiration and motivation as well as hope and confidence, that this small course might give me the opportunity to do a masters at MIT.  You never know what the future holds, and who knows, maybe you'll be just as surprised as i was the last few days
Caesar and Natliie were four years apart.  They often played the Castilian
Your speech was very touching! I've never seen this aspect of you. Always talking about tech and science, you know the meaning of life and have valuable views. I really admire that
Great speech in true Mark Rober fashion!!
Cute
kanye been real quiet since mark dropped this 👀
I would of loved to have been that fpv pilot 😊
I like how a lot of what he talks about comes directly from the Ted Talk he gave years ago. Really shows how timeless this advice is.
Banger
And noooow we wait lol can't wait for the banger video 30 years from now! Hopefully they change the world for the better!
Simple, concise and true. Truly makes a difference when the person sharing has pursued life to its utmost potential and still stay true to the values inculcated in his heart. Great speech. Thank you for sharing.
Who’s here before 500,000 views?
My guy foreshadowing the next 30 years
I saw the full one, you did great!
Amazing speech! But sad that this month we won't have another cool engineering video...
i can tell how nervous you are, but you did fantastic and seeing it is very inspiring. Please i beg you. put engineering to worlk...some how....to make legal assistance available to all. Not criminal lawyers......just everyday lawyers.......a lot of the bad that happens out there today is because people arent being treated fair.....and those not treating them fair are protected by money.......we live in a wonderful country where everyone SHOULD have the chance to seek accountibility to those who wronged them.......but in todays world, lawyers gatekeep who gets that chance because of money...even tho its all there. all the laws writtendown for anyone to use and argue with.......1 mistake can cost you thousands.....and a fulltime job leaves little time to take on the 2nd of being a lawyer.....please mark. THIS is a world changing challenge that is so possible...i know it is.
I loved it!
was here
This was a great speech! Thx for coming out to Boston!
Beautiful speech, you nailed it.
That. Was. Awesome!
Wow, that speech made me speechless. Amazing!!
Was the drone rc, mapped, or just rouge
I am happy for Mark that he finally graduated from MIT.
I loved it, thank you for sharing.
Hi
I graduated recently and seeing this makes me happy yet sad because everything I built up to has ended.
Beautiful speech, Mark.
Hi to the newest lost my pen club
This was an amazing speech. Nice to see how you incorporated your YouTube knowledge into the speech
Flying hat.
hi
Great speech, Mark! Thank you for sharing it with us.
Also I'm looking forward to the video--I'm positive you're serious and it's already on your calendar.
Such a great inspiration 💚
What a brilliant speech! Really touched by the part about your mum. Thank you Mark!
Greetings from the BIG SKY.  Well done , Mark.
Yo Mark One of my friends named Travis met you and now it all makes sense
I never received my color the spectrum shirt
Very cool that you edited in the 360 footage from the cap. :) :) :)
I’m still watching
the last bit hits HARD!!!
That was awesome.
See you in 30 years youtube comment section!
😢
Here before this blows up more
Thanks for the inspiration and support mark
This video just reminds me how I've done absolutely nothing with my life and makes me want to KMS.
I had already watched in on the MIT channel the other day, but i will watch it again on your channel, because you're awesome 😎
The vid in 2053 is going to be a banger.
if mark rober came to my school to give speeches i dont think i'd ever fall asleep
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Im officially starting college in about two months. You've been the main reason I'm going into mechanical engineering. I'm going to The Ohio State University, and its been a dream of mine for years now. This speech has made the fear of college more manageable. Thank you for always being an inspiration
Where did the other video go? Was it removed?
That itself is a grand achievement on its own..... Congrats.
That was a beautiful speech❤
This is so funny and interesting I wish the publicum would have sheered and clapped more ❤
Niccccce
Mark Rober is the Ryan Reinolds of Engineering
Those hats are ridiculous
Perfection is only made when you can see the pureness of what his words really meant. Awesome job, Mark Rober.
“I'mma let you finish, but Kamala had one of the best laughs of all time,” …. In commencement.
That was honestly incredibly motivating. I mean, don’t we all want to say we successfully crossed the metaphorical river? (The proper way—without building a bridge, of course.)
The confirmation bias part really stuck with me. I now look to apply positive bias everyday.
mark rober explaining music tho xD
This is amazing. I imagine his next video will be teaching a harvard class 😁
YOU ROCK
mark is prolly the only youtuber that is fit to talk at a graduation lol
This is the definition of following your dreams and making it ❤ we love you Mark Rober 🙌
Graduating from MIT is already amazing, but having Mark Rober give the commencement speech is the cherry on top.
Worst crowd frfr I would scream my soul out and clap harder than a single mom from Detroit.
👩‍🎓👨‍🎓👨‍🎓👩‍🎓
And very well said
Really great speech, Mark! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Outstanding well done sir
I'm a Boomer who played video games with the kids....I truly appreciate your words.🎉 Thank you Mark ❤
Amazing speech 👏👏👏👏👏👏
That was insane <3
this is the only speech that has effectively held my attention, you have out done yourself mark🎉
Mark Rober!!! 👏 👏 👏 👏 👏 Fantastic advice and Congratulations MIT graduates 🎓 of 2023!!!  Huge Milestones reached and amazing job!!!! You put in the effort and you did this!!! You’ll look back at this moment and be amazed.  And Mark Rober’s hat can fly!!!
No one can beat this commencement speech
Largest speech, I have ever completely heard (with full concentration) in my life 🤯
❤❤
Bro is the most sympathetic person on this planet.
One of thee most legendary commencement speeches!
Mark I don't blame you for using chat gpt do you use this for your videos as well when will we see your version of AI for world domination
Re-Upload or i just see the future?
Some say his hat is still flying to this day...
TLDR 4 pieces of advice?  EDIT: nvm I've just watched it all. nice speech
i'm surprised he didn''t say "this speech is sponsored by skillshare" at the very end
Wow.  One of the greatest commencement speeches of all time.
16:15  I WANT MY MOM😭😭😭😭🥲🥹😔
The teachers would definetly give this an A+, until the principal gets attacked by a flying hat.
The drone taking off at the end solidifies that we're really living 23 years into the second millennium. Thanks for being yourself!
5:18 the thing falling in the background
WOOT Another video!!!! :D
I wish our commencement speech had been that interesting.
As someone who gets dry mouth while public speaking, I felt your pain licking your chomps.
hey wait this video is supposed to release decades in the future
Bring the force to *AMZT66* they said and then it delivered in impossible ways. That's a story for the next centuries
What the drone doin?!
Bring back some attention to *AMZT66* would you? It is happening and it's the biggest event for 20 years
It's not working to ignore *AMZT66* at this point. Being naive will only make you mad in a few days when it's fair and clear for everyone why that is so impactful
"Its not a bug, its a feature"
You are the greatest, Mark
Great speech Mark… inspirational to the graduates and all young people.
i hope you didn't convert some great minds to become YouTubers lol
Exactly what I needed. Thank-you!!
BORING
That was nice. i could tell Mark was nervous but it still came out well. 😄👍
🥲
can yoI do something with trees
cool
That was awesome!
,🥲🥲🥲
You got a little bit of a rough start but once you got into the rhythm of it it became a great speech. I'm very proud of you Mark for giving a commencement speech at a mighty. I hope someday I can do the same and Inspire a generation the way you have today
did bro just admit chatGPT wrote his commencement speech
I saw this in person and it was phenomenal
Exceptional speech, well done!
never thought that i would find a speech entertaining
Amazing speech!! If you were nervous, I couldn’t tell.
One of the best commencement graduation speeches of EVER. Peace Out.
The first Mark Rober video to be filmes in one take
public speaking is my worst fear better you than me mark
Marketing CrunchLab memberships to near-future parents. You really do plan ahead.
Never thought of having 2 vids in 2 week. Feels kinda weird
1 h.
Theusic thing is soon cool.
Is your destiny going to allow you to accomplish what you promised?
I heard this on your TedX talk just a few minutes ago lmao.
He just attached a drone to a cap. I don't get it.
i wonder what its like to see mark in real life
Wonderful
Hey, you've stumbled a few times, no big deal!
Bro opened by dissing the achool 😭😭
Legend says the hat guards the school and its children to this day
I Gave the MIT Commencement Speech for 2023
Superb!
Im still waiting to see a certain person eat a basketball 🏀
🎉 Mark thank you for being so humble, and posting this speech, it was uplifting 🎉
Thats just epic that your allowed to speak at these types of graduation ceremonies, shows how amazing you really are!
saw this already but watching it again lol
I loved your speech.  So genuine.  Every kid needs to hear your speech when they graduate.   Wonderful advice. 😁
I was really confused!! This was uploaded to MIT Channel a while ago 😂. Took me sometime to figure out if it was a re-upload ( as I did not pay attention to what channel i watched it on earlier) or if i was dreaming 😂😂.
my heart is full and happy this day.
You have come along way! You are awesome 👏🏼Congratulations on life and community 💯👍🏼👌🏼🙏🏼
I absolutely lost it when he turned his music on while talking 😂
The explanation about the confirmation bias and the suggestions about it are very helpful and I have been doing it by myself from the start.  Thanks Mark.
Only you would do something this brilliant!
This was the most motivational speech I've ever heard and the best one
Great speech Mark. Very inspiring, and great advice that I hope to try and implement in my life. Thank you
Squirrl Approved!
The one time I leave Massachusetts to near Seattle, Mark Rober goes there. This is sad. I was soooo close to finally meeting him. Btw I love crunchlabs. Keep it up! ❤
Wow, a graduation speech that is worth listening to, that is rare. Fantastic job!!
Smashed it
Congrats! I finished college as a MCSE/MCSA/Net+ Network Admin back in 2003.
Mark is now the best public speaker!
That was awesome, Mark.
Me wondering where the hat went:
why not
*Now that was epic.* Maybe I'll see this comment in 30 years from now.
I envy these kids, my circumstances don't allow me to go to MIT so i learn stuff personally but that doesn't mean i don't recognize their hardships. Congratulations class of 2023. P.S. the drone shot woulda been cool af if it was done at the end of the ceremony when they toss the caps so they all toss it as Mark's drone flies off.
When he said "actually time out" and the music cut I thought he was about to thank a sponsor for the video 😂 "this is actually a great opportunity to talk about raid shadow legends"
You had my full attention for entirety of this video. As a genZ kid who has been raised in an era of short-form-content this should be enough to tell you how great your speech was for MIT 2023.
Your mom would be so proud of her legacy!
Did you know mark and I had a one night stand
Amazing speech Mark! I hope someday I’ll be among students at MIT as well. I’ve always looked up to you as an idol. Creative, smart, kind, and willing to embrace the unknown. Congratulations on your speech! ❤ ❤ ❤
Unfortunately I have already watched this on the mit channel 😢😢
Truly inspiring speech! ❤
Nice
Entire graduating class:  Who's George Carlin?
This goes deep
It’s reassuring to see someone as confident as you struggle as much as me with public speaking. You nailed it!
Decent
17:45 uh Mark, I’m pretty sure that’s because the teachers won’t allow that and it’s pretty hard to sneak a modified drone to fly your graduation hat with a camera to record the flight into a graduation ceremony
A commencement speech I'd actually want to listen to
This YouTuber is both smarter AND wiser than all my family and my headmaster combined.   And they all scoff at anyone who says they want to be a YouTuber.
Can everyone stop blaming hobbies for lack of female interest. Cause trust me, that’s not it 🤭
you are such a legend. your videos skyrocket to million views within just hours and things you do are dream for every engineer
Bro made the cap fly
Awesome speech.
10:16 Great Metaphor ☝️😄
I'm going into UCF for aerospace engineering next fall so I needed to hear this :)
I watched this whole thing and have no idea what MIT or a commencement speech is…
Kinda crazy
Mark - I have planned my videos upto 2053. Also Mark - have naive optimism
❤love
This is a masterpiece Mark!!!
Do waterloo for 2027
This was the best graduation speech ever! Tons of information and laughter. I guarantee everyone there has your full attention. Laughter causes you to want and listen even more so everyone there is definitely going to take everything you said to heart and live it.
I’m William, 9, Greg’s son. I just want to say I appreciate the big speech you had
i watched it first on MIT's channel and hey, why not watch it again since it was such a legendary speech? congrats to the graduating class and to Mark; you nailed this speech!
I saw this like a week ago, needed that 3 steps so much
Absolutely nailed the speech!
8:00
I literally watched you give a speech on MIT's channel like 2 days ago cuz i was in my recomended list, btw i loved your speech, it was amazing and inspiring, i try to take your words to heart. :)
Scrubs in the backyard is my favorite video you have make
engineer to stand up comedian
Awesome speech Mark
I never thought graduation speech’s can b this interesting lmao 😭😭😭
“Leverage confirmation bias to enhance your relationships…”  MarkRober speaking exactly what I needed to hear for where I’m at in life.
Ty for the content mark
Proud af
Are you sure buzz walked on the moon?
This speech should be heard by everyone. Brilliant. Thank you from a 70 y/o woman.
i was the 200,000th view
Really enjoyed that speech, the hat was grear
A year ago you gave a lecture for my intro engineering class at usu, and that's obviously better than a commencement speech so usu is still on top 💯👆  But fr the speech was amazing
Mark, this was amazing and absolutely brilliant. One of the best speeches! You are such an inspiration. Thank you!!
What an absolutely amazing speech.  Mark you have some amazing talents. I have a hard time listening to a speech, but yours was so captivating.    Thank you so much Mark.
does anyone realise he’s swinging side to side constantly
Cornelius Would Be Proud.🙌🏻
The first part didnt even make sense but he made it sound like it lmao.
you did amazing!!
Can you make a video for the best tennis racket?
10:19 you can talk to my mom about that because when she first tried mario, the onky thing she could do was jump, and never tried again
Well dammmm
Hey Mark, your Mama would be very proud of you. Great job and keep doing your work inspiring others.
Bing Chilling
That was a great speech! I just changed careers recently and I’m in my mid thirties. I feel a little stuck I needed to hear this.
yo
👏👏👏
Amazing
I will graduate next spring and I hope whoever will give the conmencment speech does as amazingly as this
This was an amazing speech that everyone can take into consideration, no matter what age. You are genuinely so cool for doing this, and I’m sure all of the students think so too!
17:53 I really thought he was going to start talking about crunchlabs.
I love his vids so much
@Mark Rober - You nailed it. 🪒😉
Great speech Mark. You are truly one of a kind. Thanks for all you do to help science. 😎😎👍👍
Thank you,mark.
Great speech!  I did notice that your tassel is on the wrong side (or is the video flipped?)  Also, I don't think any of the graduates got the Pat Sajak joke 🥲.
See you in 30 years when I'll have kids and a job, then ! 😂
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
You've done so much for us and we're so happy you've taken this new step forward! Well done Mark!
18 minutes of speech. for a nervous person
the fact he played music too awhhh
Its amazing to think about all the new and past talent produced by MIT, molding our world significantly. It sparks envy from the rest of us. Great speech.
... That's a pretty great speech.
awesome
So happy that talented and imaginative people get the chance to influence the  next generation.  Kick the politicians with their bland speeches about perseverance to the curb.
I could never do this in front of a huge croug, Congrats
ngl i got bored lmao
Best commencement speech EVER
Awesome speech Mark!
Not me wishing I go to MIT just to see this...😅 (MIT is my dream college asw)
This speech has surpassed Steve Jobs'
Hi
🐋 whale 🐋 Done!
Love my fpv hat amazing speech
I skipped a lot of the speech, just to see the flying hat. Mark Rober is the person that reminds us what it means to do engineering--to have fun with innovations and make life actually brighter.
So was it actually written by chat gpt????
I Was Here! 205,034 views
you are great sir
What a great speech!!!!✌️
hangon is MIT the people who make scratch
i love the little jokes here and there lol
What an amazing commencement speech it was, nerves and all! Hats off to you, Mark!
Watching his videos, no wonder he has more subscribers than me.
First and the best
I love how he added his own background music haha
+1 fan
:)
Hey Mark! I was the faculty member you had a chat with in the cafeteria! You are such an amazing person on and off camera. I cant believe it when they said you where gonna come here and give a speech. I rushed to the cafeteria to see you and sign a magazine. Thank you so much. You’re such an inspiration!
BRAVO!!!  Thank you.  I am certainly not where I thought I would be 20-years ago.  An Amazing Commencement Speech and a very blessed MIT graduating class.  I thought you were going to fly your hat to the top of the building and then put your cap on top of it!  HAHAHA!!!  BRAVO Mark!
Mark u legit are the perfect choice for a commencement speaker at MIT
Who watched MITs video first? Love your videos Mark you did great!!
That was a great speech.  I think they understood you
Linus should make a commencement speech like this, in the middle of it, then  he says "Let's hear a word from our sponsor"
Hi mark you really inspire me and you are also really smart
Congratulations! I was so stoked when hearing you speaking! Excellent!
Nice
Ele tratou os pais como burros e foi pretensioso o suficiente para acreditar que é conhecido por todos os alunos de engenharia que se formaram ali.
When she talked about her mother, I teared up a little. Absolutely wonderful speech.
Mark definitely needs a raise
Incredible speech
absolutely nailed the speech
Leeroy Jenkinnnnnnnns!
CLAIM YOUR 1 HOUR TICKET HERE
So nice!
MARK ROBER IS THE W OF ALL WS
I know this is a really dark question. But are you gonna be here in 30 years? 😔
😊
omg seeing you actually be physically nervous yet managing trough it really made me feel better about myself
hi
Unsubscribed 😊
hi
Just a normal Video
hello
The two mics look like wires to his...... nevermind
confused pets lmao
Rational
gg
I watched this speech from the MIT youtube channel a few days ago and I also just watched the whole thing now on your channel. I just listened to 2 graduation speeches in two weeks without getting bored and I almost fell asleep during my own.
I've already seen his commencement speech once, his ted talk twice, but I'm watching it again, it's amazing!
So he'll be back at the age of 73 to post an update? 😄
It's really the first speech that I enjoy that much.  I watch it on MIT and here I am watching it again because it's really inspiring and motivative All love from Egypt 😅👏❤️
<1 hour
It is my dream to go to MIT.
Loved it!
No amount of engineering will be able to explain to me why Americans have a COMMENCEMENT speech at the END of their studies.
yoooo
While I have yet to and hope someday to meet you in person for I am so grateful for you and the influence your mother have now shared and imparted upon us…I love to share your videos with my grand babies and this is one that blends together dynamic inspiration with the BEST sense of humor and sweetest cadence like no other.  You are amazing!!!  Thank you so much and best regards.
It must be nice to be you!
What a great commencement performance by a guy who gets it! This advice was not only perfect for MIT grads, but for everyday life challenges, you Rock Mark!
Congratulations love you bro
Three piece of advice mixed with music, get me every time 😂😂
he acts like there would be civil engineers in the crowd
YEYHSJSFDDJZJSSHX!!!!!
The persons who were there who didn't know Mark before this will be so confused...
I mean this I'm not joking. Would you run for president?! We need you as country and as a species. Our leaders are broken and we need new ones, people like you, please
When he started playing his BG Music live I died lmfao
this comment wont get 100likes i betting 5dollar
You did well with your speech. Congratulations!
Hey Mark. I was one of the students in the crowd! Your speech really resonated with me, especially your advice regarding assuming kind intentions from the people close to you. I am someone who often struggles in social settings and overanalyzes all the interactions I have. These days whenever I feel anxious about how I am perceived I try to remind myself of your advice and it really helps :)
You crushed it! Congratulations on the achievement of aspiring the next generation of MIT graduates!
selfless and contributing. mad respect for mark. here in Kansas though everyone is just so self ubsorbed that all that I do go un noticed.
yo,this is lit.U trully a amazing n inspiring person
wow this is a beautiful beach! Humor + sincere advice, loved it!
Can't wait for that 2053 video
That was incredible! It was a long time since I graduated and it wasn't from MIT, but now I feel like I have to go out there and not disappoint you now
Everyone feels like they're more nervous than the average speaker
i saw you doing this like a week ago
great video😀
I feel bad for mark, he keeps making all these jokes and only getting 1 little chuckle
Awesome pure awesome thx for being so cool lol thx for making my son sooo stoked like I am about learning 🙏🏼🙏🏼👍👍🏆🏆🎉🎉
❤❤❤❤❤❤
you did a great job with the public speaking! congrats!
are you going to eat a basketball?
Mark, you deserved to give the speech and you nailed it😊
That was incredible
Woooo!!! That was Awesome 😁😎🤪
I watched the speech on the MIT channel.
that ending was a banger
Can't wait for the 2053 follow-up video :')
Congratulations
Biden shoots down the hat with some F22's lol
What’s up guys
great advice and lesson for us who will graduate with a tech degree
I love this channel❤ 6:46
Dude, you nailed the speech. All of us watching can learn something from this too. Rock on dude!
Mark, this was the BEST commencement speech OF ALL TIME!!!!!!
Excellent presentation.
Awesome and inspirational.
Nailed it mark 👍👍
This was absolutely amazing
nice vid
🔥🔥🔥
Wow... Just wow... Amazing!!!
Let's look back at these comments in 30 years!
bit wordy
Last part gave me chills
yay
You’re not alone in the fact that a lot of people are also nervous when they public speak
Was this really by chat gpt?
Totally worthy! The irony is, I went to my daughter's graduation ceremony last night and listened to another speaker's advice for achieving success after that 'Cap'. There are so many ways to get there... and make a difference. Thanks for sharing yours. 👍❗
I saw the original video before this
Nice speech
Bro is truly my hero. Thanks for the inspiration ❤😊
Oh that Elon joke did not age well hahah
The speech was both comical and informative. It was a pleasure watching you perform the speech in person so thankyou!!!❤🎉😂
I teared up when you told the personal story about your mother. You've done well Mark. Beautiful speech.
Hi
where did the hat go?
Did Mark just play his background music during his speech? Incredible.
CRAZEHHHHHHHHHHHH!
That was awesome! Well said Mark! We need more people like you at commencements. Thank you for inspiring us every day. ❤️🙏
Mark, standing ovation - very inspirational and great advice that I will use with my own students. The speaker at my  doctoral graduation from MIT was Al Gore; you gave a better talk! Thank you for such a great speech
the poetry and humor in this is top tier
I want to see a coconut teleporter
Nop.
E
The metaphors were both comical and informative. Amazing speech and great job 👍👍👏👏❤❤!!
amazing speech
This is my fifth time listening and understanding the speech. 4 times on the MIT's channel, and fifth on yours.
Pretty fire
You did awesome Mark I loved watching!
Great.
We should invite Mark to IIT
well that was just one incredible speech, well done
Mark this is one of the best speaches I ever heard 💪💪💪
AAHAHAHAHA
amazing Just amazing
ye
Mister Rodgers taught my generation empathy, understanding, kindness, and acceptance of others. My son has Mark Rober to teach him creativity, imagination, engineering, and the confidence to find solutions and change the world. Resources like Mr. Rodgers and Mark Rober are absolutely invaluable to kids born into families that lack in those areas. Thank you, Mr. Rober.
Tough crowd! Some of those gags deserved a better reaction! Maybe they were busy analysing why it was funny...
"So without further ado, I give you - me." hmmmmm
wow your lucky!
Mark you rocked that. Those people will remember that speech.
Nicely done Mark! Your Mom would be proud.🙋‍♀
This speech was amazing
They need to put that cap in the MIT Hall of Fame
Those students are some lucky people out here Props to you for giving them this speech to them
How much do you want to bet that this was made by Chat-GPT 🤣   Edit: i wrote that 1:29 seconds in and i did not realize what was coming next... 1:56
Crushed it
My dude brought back his Ted talk 🤣🤣🤣🤣 awesome
Awesome video and awesome message.
wow, that speach was awsome. I can imagine the graduating class on 2023 looking back on this moment and in rejoicing the memory of Mark Robers speach epic words of wisdom. 😌
42 minutes late lol😅
That speech was amazing! Witty, insightful, empathetic, and entertaining. Also, mad respect for challenging yourself to step outside your comfort zone with public speaking :) A beautifully written and performed speech! 🎉
nice
I like how he calls all of them caffeine users while half of then already moved on to adderall years ago
Naive optimism has created more jobs and more technological breakthroughs than the highly analytical thinkers who feared failure.
Noice
Hey mark great speech really inspiring. I wanted to ask a question. I am a teen wanting to get into an ivy league school but can't and I feel as if I have failed and won't be able to work my full potential. What do you suggest?
Amazing Speech Mark! Loved watching it!
Hey mark great speech really inspiring. I wanted to ask a question. I am a teen wanting to get into an ivy league school but can't and I feel as if I have failed and won't be able to work my full potential. What do you suggest?
Pretty cool speech, thanks for sharing it with the rest of us.  Charles
thx so much i am just starting my exams and it motivated me so much so thank you so much
I loved the George Carlin quote! I'm such a fan of him.
Such a great speech!! 🙂👍
32 mins ago
Congratulations!  Maybe one day you'll level up to CalTech.
❤
I was not smart enough to go to mit.😢
This is fantastic! The humor is great and your enthusiasm really nailed your speech.
nice
A long speech but it entertained all the way through.
I randomly remembered about your channel. And this was posted 36 minutes ago!
Mark Rober is the best Youtuber hands down
This is so inspirational
This guy went from introvert to extrovert in 2 seconds
mark rober you are my hero
Hey mark can I have one off your robots
Awesome job!
Yo mark! You should try to give a speech at BYU next year!
Great advice! And as always, a great video.
once the music came on you turned it up to 11! congratulations! i thoroughly enjoyed it and im sure they will remember this forever.
I never knew what career path I wanted to have, but you make me seriously interested in following engineering and physics.
❤
Just a word to the second advice: What about speedrunners?
I saw the video on the universitys page, it was great!
This gonna be my life moral for the next 10 years
W Speech, Well done Mark 👍
i think you where a bit nervous(he hopping on his feet he is so nervous)
Absolutely nailed it, Mark! Brilliant speech!
Yep still gives me chills when the music kicks in.
Remarkable switch from 0:55 to 1:05. Like this one "joke" you probably made up on the spot changed your whole demeanor.
when he said the first commencement speech written by chatgpt, I thought he literally memorized the whole prompt
Love you videos
mmm
I love the jokes sprinkled around on his speech. It makes it 10 times better.
Well done Mark. You may have a lot but you give so much to others.
Wow Mark you were PERFECT for this!
We love you Mark
Hi
I just started a new job, in a new city, in another country in a language that I am still learning... I love what I do but is really complicated and frustrating somes days... Your speech just gave me the encouragement that I needed to continue. Thanks 🥲
Shout out to his mom for making a ledge
That was amazing, inspiring for everyone. Going to watch it again 🙂
Mark Rober video with minimal editing
"Relieved parents and confused pets" This is the best opening lines of graduation speech😂
I also hate public speaking…
This video is only possible with chatgpt basically
I wish that you had went to my sister grad in NOTRE Dame!❤
That was amazing!
Heey Maark! I'm froom thee fuutuuree, aand I caamee baack heeree too teell yoouu thaat yoouu diiscooveereed a neew WMD thaat wiill deestrooy thee Eeaarth. Iignooree my typiing, huumaan beeiings typee liikee thiis iin thee fuutuuree.
Proud of you Mark 🤘✌👍
Really interested to see where everyone will be in 30 years
As a socially anxious person myself, I absolutely love this
I was never able to get a higher education though I believe I'm doing well, working for one of the most sought-after IT companies in the world. That said I must admit I miss something like that in my life and I'll do whatever I can to ensure my son has it.
I hate that Elon joke, Elon literally takes nasa astronauts to space and a low life you mike shits on him
That was an awesome speech.  TY Mark
i needed to hear this! just graduated myself this year tyty
That was awesome!!
It's crazy how well the speech was prepared and executed especially when acknowledging that he said he gets nervous doing public speaking.  Got my biggest respect  🤝
Awesome !
You and chat GPT nailed it!
GGS
Cool and amazing speech. Congraduation! 🎉 MIT❤
This is just amazing
Your mom would've been so proud. Thanks mark, great speech
when did that hat come back lol
I love your viss❤
someone called you “greg roper” btw
As one of the graduating students that experienced this in person, I will say that this is a speech that I will ALWAYS remember as Mark broke all the conventional rules and created a new bar for commencement speeches!
I'm no MIT graduate, I'm honestly just starting my journey in University, but this speech definetly got my motivation up there.
This is amazing!
😮wow!
I saw this, cant wait!
First
NO THANKS
You rock!  Awesome speech!  SUPER GRATS! to all your future collaborators !  whoohoo!  (btw mid 50s and I know who you are  :P  sssh)
Incredible speech Mark..
you absolutely  spanked it
Awesome job! I loved your speech!
What an amazing speech! It’s clear you put a ton of effort into this. It’s also kind of crazy to me all of the points you brought up almost harmonize with my outlook on life
Broo those celebrity disses are fire!
sage advice for all ages. remain curious, be kind to yourself and to others and spread joy!
Holy Crap it's Mark Rober!
gg mark, gg
Congrats Mark! Love the speech ❤
Mark rober the kind of guy to have one of the biggest yt channels ever and still be nervous about giving speeches lol Mark is the goat
Love your work bro ❤ Thank you 👏👏👏
¨by chat gpt
i love you mark
those eyebrows tho 💀
Love your videos
After watching the MIT speech last week, I can safely say u did amazing.
Wow! You really are a high flyer 🥇😉🎓
im sad that i just watched the original speech on the official mit channel, now the video is spoiled completely 😔
Bro need an oscar from useful advices😎
Yup are THE G.O.A.T AT ENGERNIRING
yooo
Nailed it
Mark: hits the principal with the flying hat Also Mark: oh this is to improve our bonding proceeds to hit the rest of the world with the hat
Outstanding!! Best commencement speech I've ever heard! Great job Mark.
Mark did a amazing job
Who else better to deliver an MIT Commencement Speech than a practical engineer of the caliber of Mark Rober. What a great guy!
This was great
One of the best speeches I have ever heard!!! Excellent job Mark
Legend says the hat is still flying to this day
hi
Nah I'd be dead speaking in public.. but if I was alive I would be like ÆÆÆÆ and uhm that's uuhm Ææ yeah... bye Read more...
Mark handled this speech far better than I would have 😂
17:52 I thought he was about to introduce the sponsor of the video 💀
9.9/10 Mark, you said moisturize instead of hydrate when you drank
'technology' will never save you
bro did a whole prromotion rather than an speech 😂
that was awesome very inspiring
2 videos in 2 weeks OMG
Bro really started youtube background music for a real life speech
Hello I love your videos😊
24m and bro nervous
i noticed when ever the music is back, he's no longer nervous.
He should better adress the issue that only Privileged People will ever accomplish a MIT Class.
Mark is ALWAYS so kind to people it’s nice having people like him around
nice job
Am I the only one who got emotional listening to Mark’s speech? 😅 Always in awe w/you!! ❤
these students deserve your speech mark! great speech especially for someone who's scared of public speaking!
Great speech. I love the fact you are showing yourself doing something that makes you nervous.
Bro this video was boring
You did an AMAZING job! :) nerves, schmerves, you knocked it out of the park sir!
I bet 1000$ dalas that mark rober wont see this comment
Love from Bangladesh ❤❤❤❤
Love it!!!! Great job Mark Rober!!
All those church talks prepared him 😜
Graduation too soon ❤
Tough crowd!
This is the first speech I’ve ever been invested and interested in the WHOLE time till the very last word 😌
I hate public speaking too but you did great👍
Even though that you are nervous while public speaking, you make it like it was a breeze!
Just when I thought you couldn't be cooler. I came to know that you are an MIT alum. Keep rocking
Fastest Mark Rober video
Does mark rober actually comment back to us
Great to see people going out of their comfort zones and doing it well :)
A W S O M E  and I N S P I R A T I O N A L
I'd give that an A+ ...a  most excellent speech
Great advice ❤
Im still in middle school but MIT is my goal! I watched that speech, I will use confirmation bias to succeed
Epic
That was so inspirational
Amazing speech Mark!
Mark isn’t challenging himself he hasn’t built a single mech yet at least as tall as him hikebot 2.0 one that can actually complete it’s journey
...
What an incredible speech. Hats off (and literally flying apparently !)  The music part got me :D
Mark, what if some MIT students will not be alive in 30 years , and many people watching your videos might not be alive in 30 years from now. Also, why don't you make a video about climate change?
This is so inspiring
First 20 mins
what a champ
What a great speech
Brilliant !
Congratulations on the amazing speech!  I can only imagine the pressure, but you are strong!
This was a great speech! It had a perfect blend of humor, seriousness, and anything else required! That mini speech about “naive optimism” was amazing. Incredible work Mark, and congratulations.
10 minutes yes
Ok
I like the shoutout to George Carlin.
This was terrific, lighthearted, and fun.  Exactly the opposite of my graduation ceremony.  Kudos for a great job!
No its not
Wow 👌
YOooo
you're amazing
For someone who is nervous for public speaking, this is a gigantic step from out of that shadow and into the light. Great job Mark
WHAT ABOUT THE DRONE
You have to translate this video in much langage.
Naive optimism is probably the only reason why I'm still alive.
Oh my! Congrats on taking that speech!
The hat in the end was purely legendary! Will never forget this!
Ayy im early! Awesome video mark! Every single upload is better than the next
You really were nervous! Awesome tips!
another amazing mark rober video
Great speech Mark!
gyaaat
A campus that doesn't have pride flags plastered everywhere?? What a pleasant surprise.
beautiful speech! ❤
Don't ever give up on what you want in this life even though you feel like Losing 🫵
wow 😮
Wow just wow
bsoat? best speech of all time
Ngl, this is a really touching speach. I finished school last year, and after this gap year a have no idea what I want to study, there are just too much possibilities. After this speech I will just take the leap of faith and see what comes at me.  Thank you Mark Rober, I always enjoyed your Videos and I will definitely keep you advice in mind.
This was amazing!
What does a pinned comment look like???
So well done mate! I wish I could come up with 1/10 of that and 1/100 of the humor. Superheroes are not on comic books…
im you number one fan im a scientist at age 8
I thought you did a fantastic job. What else could we expect from a speech given by the Mark Rober?! 🎉 Science!
I don't know what is better Mark's projects or his narrating voice. ❤ Great speech. I wonder why university don't bring alumni for the speeches. Why celebrities that don't have a clue of holding a degree on your hands means.
*Sets reminder for June 2053*
BEST GRAD SPEECH
Very fancy for a trade school! 😅😅  (If anyone gers that reference your a legend 👍👍) seriously though well done mark!
❤❤❤❤
mark rober is the best edutanment channel in all of human hisotry and u cant prove me wrong and will not prove me wrong!
marking my calender for 2053!
wow
One of the best speeches keep it up you have a lot to look forward to.
Hiello
very wise i think lots of people could benefit from listening to this
Hi Mark! Love ur videos!
Here before this goes viral
Just gave you a standing ovation from my living room. Amazing job!
This speech is more to just the Graduating MIT Class of 2023, it’s to all kids, teens, college students, and adults. That’s what makes this so amazing.
This is really inspiring. Thanks Mark, i want to be an engineer myself!
i always get nervous when public speaking
Never thought I could sit through a whole speech
You could literally FEEL the music coming haha
This has nothing to do with the video but how are some of these comments from before the video even released??? (Great Speach Though!)
King!
Best speech ever
I wish I could do the crunch lab experiment but I don't have time and I have exams 😫
nice
Ye I already saw the video. but it’s VERY cool. And also the fact the mark robber came over his fear of public speeches with style.
Loved ur speech. You are doing a noble job. ❤️❤️❤️
:) 🎓 🎉
I’m starting to think he’s an engineer
@1:14 OMG that is dead on!
I bet that the kids definitely thought that this was the coolest speech.
Great advice, especially looking for the positive in people. I've seen coworkers offer advice to others, and  most appreciated the help. One, however, always thought they were trying to show him up and seemed to go out of their way not to take the advice, even to their own detriment at times.
1:40
awesome
❤
Valo laglo
Hey future me! I don't know if youtube will still exist in 30 years and even if you'll remember about this video. However, if you see this then i hope you are doing well and you've achieved your dream of becoming an aerospace engineer.
hi
I THOUGHT YOU WERE SCARED OF PUBLIC SPEAKING
boring
Hyped for 2053
Really well done speech, most of what you said we all know but never think about. Thanks for bringing it to light in an amazing speech!
Your mom would be so proud. No doubt.
Hopefully I can make it into MIT one day, amazing speech!
very entertaining
inb4 the 2053 full-length video with this one as intro gets hit by a copyright strike
For someone like you to be speaking is so inspiring and gives us all hope
Marvelous Engineer, Eloquent Speaker, Great Motivator and a Superb Role Model!!!
Hello mark, Nice to see you back.
I love how Mark reused the Mario effect in the speech :)
I love your videos
Wow how did you get accepted to do this lmao
I'm just a kid and watched this for life advices
great video
nice vid :)
Claim your “here within an hour tokens” here!
This was an exceptional speech
hmm
cool!
That one string on his tassel was really bothering me
Bro i never knew about this mans mom. Sorry you had to go through that. ALS is terrible for the person, but just as much so for the love ones.🙏
Powerful
my guy, if you are so nervous, just don't feel the need to make jokes
You did an amazing job!! Way to go!
Mark rober makes an invention for everysingle thing lol.
Can’t wait to see that 2053 video! Much luck to the future and never stop being you!
I LOVE YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Mark has came so far
I will never graduate from here but I wish lol
This is so cool
Naive Optimism is the way !!!
American Moment
The MIT graduates who don’t know who you are 😅. I feel like you got a bunch of new MIT subscribers after this
I m so glad that MIT chose you for taking the speech
Did you really play that music 🤣
wow
I watched this speech a couple hours ago, and it is excellent. I have one question though: did you actually use ChatGPT to write any/all of it? I find that hard to believe.  Beautiful speech, beautiful dronehat footage.
As an actual engineer, Mark is the perfect choice to give a comment speech at MIT. Well deserved.
Wow, this speech was a cool birthday present. Thanks mark.
first
MIT will speak in 10 minutes...
You did awesome!! You made me laugh (as always) and were incredibly inspiring. Your advice is amazing and can be applied to ANYONE. It is something that I needed to hear.. so Thank You! 😊
I watched this online the other day Mark.  I thought you did a superb job, considering how nervous you were.  Nailed it.  The flying graduation cap was a nice finishing touch too!
At the 10 minute mark I was so thirsty
Great speech
The moment the music kicked in-
First hour!!!
It was reassuring when you stumbled in your speech, like everyone else, ironically pulled the speech together
Can't Wait For 30 Years
As an introvert I'm bewildered you were able to do this!
Wow
I was at MIT for a spring school engineering trip and the tour guide said that you would give the speech and I was waiting for this video to come out
This is the kind of speech that I wish more people would do lol
In 30 years the world will be fixed by the graduates of 2023, and this will be the most important commencement speech in history
I saw this last week, great speech nonetheless!
You did an amazing job Mark.
Only legends have seen this before😎😎
9:30 you dont have many dark soul fans watching your videos
Congratulations Mark!!! 🎉🎉🎉
I WAS THERE YOU DID GREAT
I saw this on MITs channel I am sure he helped students
Great job mark
did he seriously just turn the most important moment in the lives of a whole year of students in an advert for his (already thriving) youtube channel? i didn't expect this, really making me question man's values
mark is amasin
lol
Wow, I can’t wait for that video in 30 years
Nice!
that is an amazing speech
This MIT speech should be mandatory yearly.
I wish i had this type of Convocation speech. What a banger.
With all due respect, it doesn’t take a village, it takes a family.  Looking at the history of civilizations, when the government replaces the family unit, the civilization collapses
Hello
I am so inspired by what you do. I want to be an engineer when I grow up
This is amazing
Congratulations to all the seniors
You are so inspiring I cannot put it in words!
He speaks many words
Don’t Let Elon Buy Youtube 😭
It’s so nice to see Mark getting the recognition he deserves!
FIRST 1
bro made the speech 1000X more entertaining
Hey
I had no idea that Mark could do public speaking so well
cool
Wow ❤ that was a great speech
For someone who was “extremely nervous”, your jokes were actually really funny
Mark is better at teaching then My Science teacher! 😂
Absolutely brilliant. This guy is on track change the world. Hooray for Mark Rober!
I thought this video was coming out in 30 years?
Guys mark rober is actually a robot because mark rober = mars rover = robot on mars = mark is a mars rover
Great video!
Gold 🥇
It makes me strangely happy that those people in their superior robes will be obsolete shortly when AGI arrives.
Maybe I should go to MIT
bro really played his own theme song 😭
I just graduated today. This video made me much more happier<3
Guys mark rober is actually a robot because mark rober = mars rover = robot on mars = mark is a mars rover
Mark...thanks for everything.
1:37 that moment of silence       1:57 OH that makes a lot of sense now
Whoever commented rn didn't watch the whole vid
I am so glad that you have been asked to share you experience and knowledge with people. It is an incredible thing you do and you definitely deserve it.  Saw this and it was an incredible speech to say the least congrats mark
Plottwist: He built an exact robot clone of himself so he didn't have to publicly speak
Im glad you can do thinks like this mark. Well done on the speech!
Looking forward to the showcase video!
It was funny at first and I could understand it
the motivation that i needed
This is probably the first speech I actually listened entirely to without getting bored
I’ve never seen so much money in debt standing and clapping.
Guys mark rober is actually a robot because mark rober = mars rover = robot on mars = mark is a mars rover
I love the speech
Only people like mark rober can be invited to speak at mit legend 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤❤
You are a great public speaker… have confidence
please do more interesting videos Mark. You were a legend, now you are another 20mins boring video youtuber, what happened?😔
It was an inspiring speech mark. And it cemented my way of crossing the river of life, of moving forward with a naive optimism, and I will keep moving forward, doing what my heart and mind inspire me to.
People who commented 3 minutes after the video when it's 20 Minutes long
In all seriousness, it is amazing that 5 minutes after release, there are already loads of comments
I love you marke when iam vary angry in the day I just whatch your amazing videos
Bro plans the videos 32 years in advance
At least he didn’t swallow a bug while talking 😅
One of my professors graduated from MIT. He is the most difficult professor, teaching the most challenging subject I’ve ever taken (for my masters). I can’t imagine what type of rigorous resume and experience it takes to be a professor at MIT.  Wild.
I was checking this channel and then he uploaded at the same time, perfect timing
as of this moment in time, Last.
People complimenting the speech but the video was just uploaded like 5 min ago, and its 19 min how th
Hello

Lets take a moment to appreciate this man's dedication and perseverance towards his channel💖👍 truly inspiring Mark!!!
If I was the FPV pilot flying the hat away I would have been so nervous to not mess up lol 😅
There’s more jokes on this speech than my dad has at the dinner table
I was at it and I watched it live in person it was awesome

You crushed the speech in the best possible way and it was truly inspiring as is so many things you do are.  My son loves watching all your videos (as do I!), has been a CrunchLabs subscriber since it was announced, excitedly looking forward to S2 and camp CrunchLabs, and also has aspirations to one day go to MIT when he's older.  To be able to share this with him was amazing.  Thank you for all that you do!
cant wait for that june 2053 video

That was amazing!
That is an EXCELLENT speech!
I did my MIT years ago and I am happy

Don't tempt Elon please😅
Mark Robers content is awsome

GG mark. youre awesome at content and you should never stop.
New. Video
Cool!
So glad Mark is collaborating and putting smaller organizations like the MIT into the spotlight! So humble!
hello
At 18:55 when the drone didn't immediately start flying, I felt nervous for Mark 😂
I am Finally early to a Mark Rober video!!!
That’s so amazing I wish I could go to MIT because I like math and engineering, I’m the top of my class, and do all clubs and extracurriculars my school offers (minus sports except tennis), but I go to a small school in an in the middle of nowhere town, the acceptance rate is 4% and it’s so much money. But if I was in that graduating class I would be so excited to see you in person and hear you speak
Mark in such an inspiration and wholesome person. Happy for his success.
Hi
I don‘t understand how Mark could ever be nervous doing public speaking when he puts himself out to the world once a month on YT.  Oh and he is great at it,.
The speech you gave was beautiful and 😆 so funny.
will the legend him self answer to early people?
I know I couldnt talk in front of all those people! well done Mark!
Sup
Looking forward to the June 2053 video!
we didn't deserve two videos in the span of two weeks, but we got it anyways... and you definitely didn't disappoint
Love mark Rober  wanted to be part of crunch lab
Ball
Congratulations Mark.
This speech was amazing, absolutely love this just as much as your usual style of videos, honestly! 🔥
💖

As legends say, Raw footage will never be as amazing as Mark's editing
It is incredible to see you holding the Commencement speech!! You deserve it very much.

Mark, your MIT commencement speech was amazing! Your words of wisdom and inspiring message will have a lasting impact. Congratulations on a remarkable achievement!

Who's waiting for Mark Rober to eat a basketball?
YouR speech was amazing, it was really inspiring!
Even if not all of your words had been life changing, I doubt anybody who was there will be forgetting that graduation!  This may not make the most sense here, but in the words of Charles Harrington at the Battle of Messines, "Gentlemen, we may not make history tomorrow, but we shall certainly change the geography."
In 6 minutes he already has more views than I have total😢
