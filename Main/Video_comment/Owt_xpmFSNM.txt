Themes last match as the old thiem 😭💔💔💔
This was the turning point... Thanks Domi for your career
Still remember watching this live from 6-4 5-3. Thought Thiem was gonna run through this one in straight sets but then somehow Andujar managed to pull off one of the unlikeliest of comebacks. Andujar was so shocked he got the win he had no idea how to celebrate LOL. Andujar is not normally the type of guy you would expect to be able to recover from two sets down (especially against a top player) or last physically in long matches, this one running 4h28m.
its me
The bodies won't do this for long time - for sure! 😢😢😢
Andujar Pablo is the master of epic come backs
the umpire voice is so deep. Dont know why but I think its cool
Excellent play
Thiem is terrible this year
I don’t want to be mean. I think the girlfriends play a lot in players’ professional live. See Mirka, Jelena, Maria, no one is like Thiem’s new girl friend, the circus performer! I think Mlendenovic is much better! No wonder Thiem lost in first round and he even doesn’t join Halle, instead he goes to Majorca!
This is kinda like Djokovic vs Nadal because most people were supporting nadal
Thiem has shortened his backswing on both sides. He can forget 2021
oh no thiem 😭
what a comeback win !
Passé
Quite the upgrade I must say
Domi is just shit since winning US Open
Thiem grunt is so annoying
Best ever play...❤❤❤
Wow!
Dass ist ein Schock Dominic Thiem schon raus in Runde 1 auf seinem Lieblingsbelag wo er vor einem Jahr noch im Finale war😯...er ist noch weit entfernt von seiner Form wie bei seinem US Open Sieg 2020 seitdem gelingt ihm nichts mehr wirklich normalerweise muss ihm dass befügeln dass er noch mehr Mayor Titel gewinnen kann 🤔...er muss schnellstens wieder in Form kommen weil sunst schaut nicht gut aus dieses Jahr mit große Titel
Thiem deserve to lose after playing such rubbish. After the first two set like he stopped playing and think he won already. Smh!!🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
Amazing, Andujar
probably the last year of thiem before retirement
Pablo is back
(
Eras mi candidato thiem 🤦🏽‍♂️
Never count out a Spaniard on clay!
Dominic "anybody can beat me" Thiem... This guy sucks at the net
Thiem is just overrated XDDD
Now that just made it just a bit easier for Rafa now that Dominic is gone....
Shame Thiem! How?! I was really thinking you could make it this tournament...
I feel bad for thiem as a rafa fan they always have great battles I hope he finds his for again
¡Bravísimo Pablo!. Increíble la remontada que has hecho. 🥰😍
If compilations stay this short the matches should’ve been crappy! I’ l take a spare hour to watch ALL the first weeks matches!
Thiem trash this year!
Is Thiem wearing a vinyl shirt
Enorme Andújar!! Impresionante lo que ha hecho remontando 2 sets a Thiem, enhorabuena a este gran conquense y a seguir disfrutando!!!!
What happened to Thiem? His shot-making does not have the strength and precision. :((
This is unbelievable! What just happened here? Thiem? Ahhh!!!
Wtf are they wearing masks for? Wheres leadership these days? Grow some balls...
Bless him, he couldn't believe it
not great not terrible
@roland garros: i believe cutting out the final handshake in tennis is a bad idea. add those 5 secs in your video, as everyone else is doing!!
Thiem 😭😭😭😭😗😗😗
Andujar will win RG 2021!! 🤣
Watching this match still felt sad. Bounce back, Dominic Thiem. Tennis needs someone like you.
The prince of clay overthrown
It's already early summer. Are you all doing well?     China should take full responsibility for spreading the corona to the world.  And that nation should be destroyed.
3.5 minute highlights for an epic 5 set match. This is why I don't watch tennis anymore.
The Austrian looooooosr
RG this year worst for Thiem and Muguruza they must leave in first match
So basically Nadal just have to beat Joker to win the tournament again.  French open is a joke, only one or two have a shot to win the tournament every year.  At least on grass or hard court is 5 or 6
03:15 Did andujar win FO 2021?
Andujar in the right place, at the right time, this spring to capitalize against two great players not playing their best
Dhiem became villain
What a shocker...can't believe Thiem is out
Something about Thiem's groundies is off especially the forehand side. It's like he's going for it but not getting enough pace or penetration from the spin.
Something is seriously wrong with Thiem. He won his first Junior slam at RG. Has defeated Djokovic on clay, reached finals at RG, won/finalists at Rome, Madrid . Reality something wrong with Thiem mentally and physically and emotionally
Great comeback by Pablo !
Torneo bien difícil de descifrar!! 👍👍
John 3:16-17 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen
que huevos tienes Andújar!!! 💪💪🇪🇦🇪🇦🇪🇦
Love it. Well done Pablo!!
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates 🎈
What is wrong with Thiem these days. Man. So disappointing. Just handing grand slams to Djokovic by playing like shit.
0:55 How many guys on the tour would applaud their opponent when losing
Andujar never gave up. That’s a great attitude
wow simply outplayed for the last 3 sets...grats to andujar
2315 angel number
What happened to Thiem? I thought him as a next Nadal in clay court
I will repeat what has been said. Show the handshake at the end of the match.
So Andujar’s win against Federer the other day wasn’t a fluke
What happened? I mean Andujar has always been pretty good but Thiem was supposed to be the prince of clay.
Is Thiem out now?
Awesome mental fortitude

This channel finally caved in to the highlight length “feedback”
Total, después caerá Andujar.
GOOD  TENNIS.  GOOD PLAY.
Hey brothers and sisters, I love y'all and it's just been in my heart today to share that Jesus love y'all so much and unconditionally. I don't know how much time we left on this earth before Jesus comes, but I want all of us to be ready when He does. Let's leave these things of this world behind for in scripture it says in Matthew 24:35 that heaven and earth will disappear, but my words will never disappear. " Also in 2 corinthians 4:18" So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen, since what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal." Time is so short. And I always say this" I want all of us to be saved. " Jesus is coming back soon." with tears in my eyes I love you guys. Let's take Jesus and His words seriously in these time were in. I know the road isn't easy because there are so much distractions and temptations in this life. But through prayer and fasting we can overcome them. I don't want to force anything on anybody or even force them to do something they don't. But if you were to see your mother about to get hit by a big truck, you would do everything to try and save her. So I do the same thing for us about the wrath of God that is to come. I don't want anyone I love, know/don't know or even those who hate or dislike me to face such things. Because I know every soul is precious to God and are valuable to Him. Because before we were born He know us, He knitted us in our mother's womb, He called us to be His children . His love for us is so great and so strong, it's beyond human comprehension, that even the angels in heaven don't understand it. So I want to tell you it's time to get ready, time to prepare ourselves for the Second Coming of Christ, for the trails and tribulations and for the rapture. As you can see, so many people have turned away from God. The world has become so immoral, wicked, disgusting and violent. Killing people without any care or heart. And that shows that the love of God is growing cold in the hearts of people. Please be ready for when the Son of Man comes. Time is running out. Let's not leave this world with regrets. Because I tell you this, my biggest regret is not knowing Jesus Christ earlier. I love you Guys and Jesus loves you too, that's why He didn't think twice about dying on the Cross for us, knowing that we may not even love Him back. Please take what was said today in consideration because ready or not Jesus Christ is coming back believe it or not Jesus is coming back.   How to be saved? To be saved, a man must confess that Jesus is Lord while acknowledging in his heart that Christ must have full rule over his life and that he died on the cross for our sins and was resurrected on the third day🙏🏾. Also one must repent and turn away from thier sin. NOW, is the time to turn to JESUS, do it before its too LATE and the DOOR of Grace is Shut.  Prayer of Salvation in Jesus Christ🙏  Dear Lord Jesus, I know that I am a sinner, and I ask for Your forgiveness. I believe You died for my sins and rose from the dead. I turn from my sins and invite You to come into my heart and life. I want to trust and follow You as my Lord and Savior.  Spreading the Gospel on every content🙏❤️🤗
I met this guy some years ago. He was a nobody . An amazing run and win against Thiem and Roger. Would love to be feeling like how he's feeling after that win. Amazing effort. Well done Pablo 🙏🙏🙏🙏
There it goes one of the two players in the world who have a slight chance to beat Rafa
Djoko est aidé par son ami de Lacoste Andujar qui facilite son tableau lui qui a elimié Djoko en 2017 avec humiliation 3-0 et 2018 3-2 merde bonne nouveklw
Donomic theme needs to change is coach and is style of playing.  Playing too deep and not coming to net it's going to cause you that's 1.  Converse energy that's 2.
End sexist wage discrimination against men. Pay them more for playing more tennis and getting higher tv ratings and ticket sales.
Nie mógł chłop uwierzyć, co się stanęło.
*It's time to repent and seek JESUS* .He gave his life, and suffered the wrath of the Father in the cross, to save you from a eternal hell. For God loves you, but the sin must be punished. On the third day He raised from the death, showing to the world that He is God. So stop sinning and clean your life. He returns soon to judge and destroy the sinners. *Read the Bible.* *THE END IS NEAR.*
Just visually, it seems to me like Thiem is struggling to readjust his game to clay after adjusting it so effectively for hardcourts. The past couple of years, from the 2019 World Tour Finals onwards especially, he shortened his backswings (most dramatically his forehand's) and committed to taking the ball much earlier on hardcourts. That has obviously paid dividends at hardcourt events, but this entire clay season it's looked like he hasn't readapted his groundstroke game to clay at all. He hasn't changed back to his older huge backswings that worked so well on clay before, and apparently as a result has consistently had trouble generating the same enormous power and spin off of both wings that made him such a threat on clay before, and he still seems overly committed to taking the ball early instead of moving back a bit and giving himself more time to set up a powerful shot like he used to do. Taking the ball early still has advantages on clay, but not as much as on hardcourt, and definitely not when it results in him hitting a weaker ball that goes the direction he wants but doesn't have the pace to penetrate the clay and thus sits up for hit opponent to get to (instead of going past them like it would on a hardcourt).
RG finalist for 2 consecutive years : 2018-2019 And now, almost completely washed up
Andujar seems to be a never-give-up fighter and a talented clay court player. We saw this recently vs Federer. Credit where credit's due! For me, I think an 'on form' Thiem would have put away 1:26 and 2:50 for clean winners!
To Roland Garros- Post all the matches on your website or a channel here instead of these pointless highlights Regards Everyone
*SPANIARDS, fight until the end* David Ferrer 🇪🇸 Rafa Nadal 🇪🇸 Pablo Andújar 🇪🇸 *Trully warriors*
Bravo Pablo¡ Que grande eres¡¡¡¡¡¡
Is it just me or Thiem kinda lost speed and power after the covid break in 2020?
Roland Garros - generous with their final sets, stingy with their highlights
No space for Thiem's behind the back shot on 5th set?
the balls look so powerless
3.5 minutes that’s so rare from Roland Garros.
Think , if they improve highlights , more people will be interested in this tournament
sadly for thiem and for the tennia fans this noob andujar will be eliminated just next round
Is Thiem suffering with long Covid? His intensity levels here are so below what I'm used to seeing from him!
PabLo on a High.
Lots of shots from the Jar of AnduJar.
Al aire libre, con sol y en tierra batida, cualquier jugador ibérico puede ganar a cualquiera.
Man I love Grand slam 3 setters look at that. Dominic is going through something he cant be this bad. And trust me he played beautifully just made the wrong shots I was watching the game
Schade das Dominic verloren hat 😩💕ich wünsche ihm für die nächsten Wochen viel Glück
Why Thiem not advance his tactic play? Jus monoton?
stellar performance to outclass thiem!
Thiem, low performance...
If I were Theim’s coach I would have told him to slice is backhand and chip his forehand. It would have helped him win.
Dominic.. What a waste
No player seems to get into more 5 setters than Thiem.  Andujar is very good but Thiem should have won.
Now Medvedev doesn't look so bad😅
DID YOU GUYS NOTICE??? Roland Garros YOUTUBE account hasn't uploaded yet the HIGHLIGHT of Naomi Osaka 1st round match ✌️ Im smelling some not so good spirit from the Clay Court Grand Slam👎
In my opinion, team is getting very close to the end of his career. Unless he stays for a long time with no big injury or such or keeps going on like the big 3 or makes a big and I mean BIG mental come back, hes almost done.
can't understand that at which direction his game going on. Not in good forms that's acceptable in Tennis but bye in first round, really frustrating & disappointing.. Congrats Pablo & good luck for next round.
Wow Thiem 1st round French Open loss is huge!
¡Bravo Pablo! ¡Estás lanzado! Well done Pablo, you're on fire!
Thiem has had the worst year man.
Hey All! I am 26, can I reach Andujar level if I start playing now?
What a huge surprise! RG uploading 3+ minutes highlights!  Oh, and then there's Thiem losing in R1.
i think dominic good on hard court no doubt
Great short highlight. Keep it up!
Thiem needs to get his head sorted out.  Sad stuff.
1:00 what a kick serve
WTH???? This Andujar dude is taking out some big names. I'm also a little annoyed by it as well.
Thiem was ousted in first round, what a surprise but most of the contenders would be happy to hear of this result
I'm surprised nobody has said anything about Thiem's clearly less impressive physique. This has been obvious to see since winning the US open. He's lost mass and his legs show it in particular. The weight of his shots have shown a stark decline, even as early as 2021. He couldn't hit through Dimitrov, because his shots weren't as powerful, weren't as heavy, as we were used to seeing.  He dug deep this match, but he seems to potentially need to find his motivation in practice. Of course, I'm only guessing here, and I hope he gets back to his best level. I loved watching him play
Damn, andujar is like a wine! Hes getting better now than ever lol
Terrible Thiem
Is there a large crowd or is that fake clapping?
Even though thiem lost. First two sets were really strong great shot making. He just lost it completely right after that
What a match fixing
Only Spaniards can win on clay tennis courts🎾☺
What a great comeback... I really admire Andujar’s fighting and never giving up spirit even against Fed in Geneva... Hopefully he will be able to progress far and do well this year in FO
thats shocking  loss
Coming back from 2 sets down to beat Thiem at the French: amazing effort.
WHHHAAAATT?
Thiem is having a mental breakdown or something like idk what’s going inside his head right now, after 2 solid set leads and he lost like why?
More big names upsets on the way
Is Theim being held hostage while a much thinner impersonator who can’t play tennis is on the loose?
The prince of clay they say. I'd better off watching Benoit Paire smashing his racket
*3 minutes of highlights when the match lasted 4h28, what a SHAME.*
From the beginning Thiem seems not a same person I've seen so far. Power and movement is way slower and especially his foot looks very heavy. Well done Pablo!
Thiem letgo us open 😂
Thiem played bad because he lacked of confidence on his backhand.  he slice so much. Similarly to federer , when he feel unconfident . it seem that 1 hand backhand easily make himself unconfident than 2 hand backhand ? Rarely i see 2 hand backhand player lack confidence
Thiem 😂
Thiem wasn't returning andujar service it was seeming like isner serving on the other end lol!
¡Maravilloso Pablo!
How could you ..... 🤔🤔🤔
What’s wrong with Thiem this year, omg 😳
WAKE UP DOMINIC
Love the W for Andujar. Couldn't imagine winning 3 sets in a row against Thiem - legendary upset. Thumbs down for less than 1 minute of highlights per set played though.
This goes to show how great the 3 ameegos are! I mean 1st rd GS matches are Always always tough! There are no EASY matches yet Rafa  Nole and Feds over the yrs make it look super easy!
dommage pour toiletain  , mais ça prouve que roger a perdu contre un bon joueur andujar
Since breaking up with Kristina. Not great already.
I have just recently gotten into tennis but these wins by Andujar and the "Big 3"s longevity are great signs for the game! Professionals are playing into their mid-30s with great success. This opens up the floodgates! What a beautiful sport with a 15-20 year long career in some cases!  Don't know what happened with Thiem's game here. He sent the ball into the net with his backhand so many times. Strangely, it seems he won every game he served VERY quickly in the later sets, yet somehow Andujar kept climbing ahead of him. A deceptive loss if that makes any sense.
Tennis veterans are on another level compared to other sports. So many players in the top 100 that have been around forever.
Nelson Mandela : "it always seems impossible until it's done".   Andujar must have felt a little like that, coming from 2 sets down to defeat a player that he probably had never beaten before.
Thiem needs to hire Tsitsipas's psychologist to help him mentally! Otherwise, he will keep sabotaging himself into oblivion.
Thiem needs a new coach, badly.
It goes to show that Thiem is just an overrated player.
So it all comes down to build-up of a  grand slam match. Thiem did not play all 4 clay court matches this season.Played a few and looked considerably off-colour. So no wonder this happened although even to my surprise too early in 1st round this I did not see it coming from him. He is a bit like Wawrinka in all respects.Very flashy and power serve and forehand.That is how he constructs his game but looked a complete player up until Aus open 2020 final.I mean that was an epic match against Jokovich.It looked like he will only improve from there but Covid year sort of pushed his plans back in terms of rhythm and form. He does not seem to have hunger and killer instinct of late.Also looks like he is struggling with his movements especially look tired and not much swift and nimble on his feet. He will comeback for sure but throws RG even more wide open for newbies
Ahh, not even worth reading the comments on these videos because of all the complaining. These short highlights are much better than sitting through a 10-20 minute video- leave those types of highlights to the independent content creators.
What's wrong with Thiem? - Djokovic should help him to overcome this challenge
rubbish Them,he.can retire now😁😁
lol thiem is the biggest joke on tour
WHERE’S THE FULL REACTION AND HANDSHAKE?!?!?!
Andujar ! I must say is play impeccably well ! This is exceptional! I have followed his game and he sure is onto something ! This is his time ! All players blossom , plateau , wilt , but this right here is his period to peak and excited for what lies ahead for him ! Great play from both ! Thiem is no easy feat !
Vamos Andujar!!!
what a match! the beauty of grand slam, never give up
Andujar just played smarter tennis. Thiem needs to learn hitting big down the middle when your way out of position isn't the best strategy.
Even though I am happy that Thiem won last year’s US open I still feel it is so undeserved ! He should have won his first by beating one of the big 3 in the final. That would have helped his mental strength. He’s completely lost it at the moment.
changing position on the opponent's serve was the root of all evil. He lost his balance and you cannot return a serve 6 meter behind the baseline. The further away from the baseline the further away he is from winning
Spanish players are generally very good on clay courts so if your game has flaws they will expose them. Its never good to meet them in the early rounds if you haven't found your form on the clay. Pablo showed mental toughness to come from two sets down, that was impressive.
thiem...
thiem its injured i think....only logical explanation for such a drop off
Andujar has had a decent year, so this was a tough first rounder. But on a grinder's tour (which is what the ATP has devolved into) and on clay, Thiem is like the grindiest of grinders. There's no strategy, there's no Plan B. There is only grinding.
Lo bueno que Thiem festejo por estar en la parte de abajo de cuadro y no en la de arriba y pierde en primera ronda jajaja
What happened to his big hot butt? :(
Shame on you RG Official YT channel.  What would be the next highlight? the Thumbnail with the score?  Lame video highlights, keep up with your work to divert fans to other sports.
thiem needs a new coach. He needs to rework his game plan and get more balls in rather than always rely on outhitting his opponent with big shots and winners.
Is he less hungry due to winning a Slam already? That's what I see. He of course want more, but his curiosity "lessened" after winning one Plus, it's no rocket science that whack prep (less match) won't send you to final
You saw Adujar's hamstrings going into a cramp when kneeling after matchpoint? He rolled around real quick to give them a stretch.
Wow! Thiem found himself in the same postion as Nadal was against Tsitsipas, at the 2021 AO.
Can we please make "He just got AndujaRED" a thing already?!
wtf
Remember this is the guy that almost beat nadal
I think thiem is a good player not more than good.
What happened to Thiem this clay season?
Thiem doesn’t seem to have the killer instinct and at times looks lost out there. Even though he didn’t play poorly today, he should have put this guy away after going up 2-0 in sets.  Very disappointing.   :(
Thiem was so bad today
Whatever happened to Dominic? He was a beast, now he's like a timid house cat.
I can’t understand what happened to Thiem. He was supposed to gain confidence from his first GS but the opposite happened. I believe he will boınce back soon though.
i dont like dynamic camera
So sad
Disappointing from thiem :(
But he  can never beat nadal.. Hahahaha
This is just karma for thiems 5 set comeback win against Kyrgios at AO haha.
FELICIDADES PABLO 🎾👊❗
Where’s the handshake god damn it???
Thiem's new girlfriend has drained him. Thiem was totally fine until he met his new girlfriend in January. He realized he had missed so much great sex in last 10 years.
Never underestimate any Latin players on clay. They're almost all super consistent with sound footwork
First big upset of the Open! Congrats to Andujar.
It's a shame, Thiem always looks like a random shot player. He must rise his consist. skill
Another big scalp.
Great effort though after 2 sets down.
Thiem what are you doing?
It just confirms again how great Rafa is.. in terms of consistency. Hope Domi comes back great as he was.
Andujar - future no.1 and multiple grand slam winner !!     mark my words
R u kidding me?????
Highlight beyond 3 mins is more shocking than thiem losing!
just like kenin
Donminic Thiem is a disgrace
Point your head forward wipe off the dust and go on! wimbledon is waiting! Winners get up where losers lie! For me you are a champion anyway because you brought many children in Austria and also me to this wonderful sport! I am sure that the sun will shine for you again....keep your head up champ!💪
What a performance...!.!!! Versus Thiem.!!!! 🤩🤩🤩🤩
i know thiem is in a massive struggle this year, but wasnt expecting him to get overpowered in the first round of french. hopefully more luck on hard who knows
Enorme Andújar!!!!, el otro día te vi en Ginebra ganando a Roger...también es verdad que Federer está falto de competición, pero no te quita ni un ápice de mérito lo que estás haciendo!!!, sigue así!!!!
The current generation are trash.  We all should take the time and appreciate and admire the job the BIG THREE are doing and continue to do to provide us with great tennis over the past 10 plus years.  The mental toughness and hardwork and effort are on many levels above the current crop of tennis players.  We fans when we debate who is the GOAT we often tear down the other  player in order to elevate our fav when we debate.  But no matter if we are Fed, or Nadal, or Djokovic fans we all should give all of them our utmost respect, adoration, and love to Fed, Nadal, and Djokovic.  They have earned it.  We will never witness tennis players like them again in our lifetime after they retired.
Less effort but feel more. It's exhausting just to watch. Gotto be less effort.
I think somehow Thiem lost his motivation after winning the USO. Having 1 slam is enough, I guess.
Tsitsipas gonna be no3 till the end of the year.. Dominic is out of form, and Daniil hate clay..
Hopefully my Favorite Player in Dominic Thiem of Austria can turn this miserable season around on the Grass Courts. Grass is his Least Favorite Surface, but a lot of people forget that he has won a Grass Court Singles Title before.
THIEM IS FINISHED
Feel for bad for thiem 😔😔
big congratulations to pablo andujar, being able to beat federer and thiem in just a short period of time its a big deal
Dominic has to stay out of the tours for couple months to regroup.. Is impossible to forgot the level of tennis he was playing last year..
I don't know about you, but in the small animated intro i see a nadal vs tsitsipas game
Hope thiem will be back stronger and motivated. Congrats andujar
This match was amazing.
Πήρε η Chelsea το champions League για αυτό δεν το νοιάζει
This match reflects the power of head which the tennis player mustn't never lost, even playing on the edge. And whilst i feel me bad by Dominic cause he retires so early from RG, congratulate to Andujar cause he never gave up and won one of  probably better matches in his career.
I hope that Dominic still remembers that it took him several Grand Slam final losses before he managed to win 2020's US Open. He is definitely suffering now, but I still believe that he will come back.
Seems like many winners from Domi came back strangely...
Thiem please stop drinking Red Bull!!!
Member the old days with 12 minute highlites?  Yeah I member.
Please can we have at least 6 minutes in every game?Please
Oh no! What is wrong with Thiem?🤔
I've been saying it since Thiem started the clay court season this year, where things on the court are not working out for him at all, where he only gets to the first three rounds and is defeated. Something has to change in him, perhaps he is very tired both mentally and physically, where he should take a good rest and recharge. It cannot be that the one who would be Nadal's nemesis on clay is eliminated in the first rounds. As I said, something is happening to him to be defeated early. IMHO!🤷🏻‍♂️🎾🤔
Great win for the spaniard
Adiós Massú
Loooooooooooonger videos please
Unless Nadal gets injured, I see no one able to beat him. He will win #21 😴
ahhh RG is back, it's the "2 minute highlights for 5 set upsets" time of the year...
Highlights without the handshakes... you should know better
Vamos Andujar!  He could have beat Thiem earlier if he hit attacked/hit deeper to Thiem's backhand.  He gave Thiem too many easy balls to his backhand in the first two sets but became more aggressive to close out the match!
What! He was up 2 sets! 😲😲😲😲😲
Incredibly stupid to make 3,5 minutes highlights of such sensation
Thiem needs to stop 'admiring' his shots... and stay IN the point.
Sad to say but Thiem has been figured out finally. Like if you check the numbers he is playing insane tennis. And apart from the 5th set today he was ridiculously good today. However, from the 3rd set you could see that Andujar was just playing the tennis of his life and that Thiem could do nothing about it. He's also mentally not there really any more. He played excellent tennis in madrid and couldn't touch Zverev who was unplayable I get that. He played out of his skin in rome and Sonego was better than him I can sort of get that (home crowd and everything plus he's so unpredictable when he's playing well only the big 3 can beat him pretty much). I can understand being unlucky 2 times in a row, but here in a slam? Where he's playing a formidable opponent in decent form yes but come on domi you're the man. You're playing well and cruising and once your opponent raises his level there's nothing you can do about it? It's definitely time to change something. The coach, the tactics, the mental approach I don't know. Maybe there's a lingering injury somewhere that even he doesn't know about. But if so get some rest man. Recharge physically and mentally please. Cause it's obvious that the best thiem currently just doesn't have what it takes to win a couple of matches let alone a title of any sorts.
Semi Final line up: Nadal vs. Djokovic and Tsitsipas vs. Berrettini. Finals: Nadal vs. Tsitsipas. Winner: Nadal in 4 sets.
Thiem has always been overrated. That slam was the luckiest slam of all time
우승 후보가..이론~~
Nadal will get SNIPED if he tries to play the rally game without pressing HARD. He's coming to the age where his famous grinding isnt as effective. Just look at his latest scares on clay, he came from behind on Berrettini at one of the tournaments but its getting scary when he isnt decisively dictating, which he can still do.
This is one of the slowest courts I’ve ever seen
Thiem is a brilliant player, no doubt about it, but he's no Rafa.   Over close to 20 years Rafael Nadal has demonstrated that-- If he's not playing well, or even feeling great... he can keep aside his mind and emotions and still pull out a win. There will be no other player of Nadal's caliber on clay in our lifetime.
Well done Pablo Andujar!! :)
hey why not in 4K ?
Raise your hand if you think a top 5 player, including Nadal cant be taken out if they dont try. *Watches all the kid's hands raise because 'its Nadal'*
It was a 5-setter so don't expect their highlights to be this long... unless they are using Naomi's fines LOL If they cared so much about media, you would think the French Open would spend more money, time, and effort on these highlights. Such a hypocritical Grand Slam. But I think most Grand Slams have issues. Australia with keeping a racist/bigot name like Margaret Court - and no, you can't separate someone's character from their achievements. Wimbledon with their stupid grunting controversy but not an issue any more and why does it have to be all white? Is it run by old straight white males? It is 2021. US Open? My least favourite open because they are the most rude to non-American players compared to other Grand Slams but I do like how they encourage fans and players to be who they are.
Amazing win!
😯😯first round .
Am I seeing FO highlights that are more than 1 min 12 seconds? Someone new must be in charge of uploading these videos.
Difference in the Big 3 vs. the rest -- even when they are not playing their best or more importantly feeling their best (like Thiem today) they still have tools and strategies in their arsenal to win. They have a plan A, B and C.   Thiem at his best can bulldoze his opponents, but when he's not feeling it, he seems very one dimensional. Today it felt like he was just smashing the ball and expecting the opponent to miss.
Ahh man — hate to see Thiem lose in the first round of Roland Garros
Indeed a highlight to watch...
Grande Pablo, me alegro mucho por él porque tiene mucho tenis y no ha podido hacer grandes cosas.
The disbelief after victory , I felt that
Expected Result, Domo mentally spent since USO last year. 2021 isn't going to get better for him unfortunately. Needs to get back to the drawing board and refresh.
Did Thiem play badly-- No. Was he at his best-- probably not.   Andujar was just too solid and probably buoyed with his recent win over Federer, was much more confident than Thiem. Dominic it seems is suffering from a crisis of confidence. At times it felt like something was weighing him down.
Tangina ka thiem and what a shame as a rank #4 to loss a match against rank #68 grrr what happened theim? What went wrong ? You’re so good at thi RG and never loss any 1st round 🙈🥺😥. I really hope so you could bounce back ASAP domi 🙏🏼.
Thank God I no longer have to listen to the sound of Thiem ejaculating each time he strikes the ball.
INCREI'BLE a lo Nadal..😎
well that's 1 less person team Djoko and team Nadal has to worry about....bye bye Thiem
How can people still say he's better than Novak on clay lmao. Delusional kids
In the span of a month, Andujar has beaten both Federer and Thiem. What a guy.
Pablo ha tirado de oficio y mentalmente ha sido perfecto, a lo que hay que sumar el bajón mental y físico de Thiem. Enhorabuena Pablo!!
Andujar has been delivering nasty upsets lately. not even surprised.
I did NOT, I repeat, did NOT anticipate thiem going the whole way in this. He has been beaten up and I think only tsitsipas can challenge djok or nadal.
I love how nadal is in the intro animation. I hope you dont change that in the coming years. Maybe even make a matador mascot for the tournament 😁
Theim isn't in same league as big 3. He won uso  bcoz  joker was suspended and nadal didn't play. He's touted by fed fans as heir to nadal bcoz they know fed record will be surpassed by Nadal  here. They hope that theim  achieves  what fed failed to achieve- beat nadal at rg. The longer the match went, I felt andujar  had more chances because theim tends to lose 5 setters, albeit  with a 2 set lead. So its titsipas  and zverev  the main threats  in this side of draw. I see titsipas as second favourite after nadal
1:36 .... Dr Nozman?
Wow, that was rather surprising. Back to the drawing board Thiem.
I am gutted... please bring your form back Dominic!! We want you back!!
Show. The. Bloody. Handshake.
any spanish player is dangerous on clay they are very talented congratulations to Pablo !!
Trump 2020
Thiem’s forehand looks so weak compared to 2019-20
No
Thiem seems to have lost weight. His butt and legs were the source of his power off the ground. He needs to get back in his previous shape.
Интересный факт, все кто за последнее время обыгрывал Федерера, потом выстреливают так или иначе!
As bad as it is for Dominic but Andujar really playing well
3min resume of a 4hours match...
Thiem forgot to play after US Open
Is this for real its not a prank? Thiem is out in the 1st round. Huge surprise!!!!
I say it again. Thiem plays badly when he is in a relationship! Say bye to that chick and focus on your career!
35 is the new teen age.
When you’re moaning and losing. I love it.
💪🏻🎾❤️🏆
People really believe the hype. At least Austrian fans think Thiem as some special knowledge. He won a slam with no one playing there. He is no coming back because he was never there in the first place. Beside, Andujar is a real clay court player from Spain. Vamos !.
Wow. Great gutsy win.
Andujar is on fire last few months. And for Thiem, unfortunately, he played to soft to win...
Thiem whats going onn??????
Whats happening to thiem??
Bruh Thiem had a 2 set lead
Thiem wtf
First Federer, now Thiem. Andujar is an inspiration! 🎾
Andujar is on a mission, defeating one Top 10 player after another ✅
And you thought Thiem is better than Tsitsipas, ignorant fans.
NO!!!  NO!!!  NO!!! I wanted thiem to win roooland gaaaros!!! :(
I'm shocked. Thiem has been the 3rd best Clay Court player in last 5 years and for him to lose in a first round is just shocking. Well done Andujar tho
BWEEEH!!!
1:00 this kick serve...
thiem should hunt down the person responsible for giving him the prince of clay title. what a jinx!
Not a good year for Theim. Think he's got some personal issues to deal with. Not himself. Sad
Whoa whoa 3 minutes Roland Garros? Let’s not overdo it now.
It shows why Nadal is the greatest. It’s not easy to perform on clay courts consistently, Thiem was two times finalist in a row and people started to call him the prince of clay. Most of the great players have suffered on clay courts including Federer, Djokovic, Pete Sampras. The only exception is Nadal. You can never compare his achievement on clay courts with any other players of any era, even not close to compare. This is the most difficult surface and one French slam is more than three slams of Wimbledon and two slams of hard courts. Its not serve and volley to get easy points on clay,you need to earn each point with your sweat and strength.
I think if thiem drops to 9,10,11 in the world, he will regain the fighting spirit he lost after the atp finals idk just a guess
Longer highlights please. Help grow this beautiful sport
A month ago, i said Thiem was playing the worst tennis of his carrer...he lost his explosive tennis...No damage in his shots...Credit to Pablo though
GODujar conquered Federer and now Thiem. Nadal better watch out. Lmao
This is why the big 3 are the big 3. This used to happen all the time - take a look at the match logs of Sampras, Agassi, Borg, Connors, Chang, Lendl, McEnroe etc. - getting knocked out was a common occurrence like a golf event - that’s why Fed/Nadal/Djo are the undisputed top 3 of all time and there is no argument.
Wow Thiem got a massive blow today. Thats gonna be hard to recover from (mentally). Wow …
After several elbow surgeries, at 35 y.o., winning Federer and Thiem in two weeks is absolutely magnificent by Pablo Andújar.
Please DON'T give out the name of the winner on the screen!!! You spoil all the fun! 😠
Show handshake at the end of the match, dont be amateurs.
Absolument la classe!
OK so they play for more than 4hours and somehow you manage to cut it into 3:31 minutes? That's "impressive" lmao
Is there a rule that these 2 players have to wear similar outfits? It is tough to see who is who hitting the ball.
Не сказать что Тим плохо играл, просто испанец играл впечатляюще. Заслуженная победа! А Тим не дожал противника.
Guys something is really wrong with Thiem. I refuse to believe this is him. Congrats to Pablo though👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
grande andujar
Another 🔥 flame out for the next gen at grand slams
Soon as Thiem won his first slam I knew he was a one slam wonder. His tennis is basically based on physical game, now that he is ageing ,his performance degrades and physical ability too. He has passed his peak. I doubt if he will win an atp title ever again.
EPIC. OMG I really liked this guy after the heart he showed in his match with Federer, and now I’m so happy for him
Bad draw for Thiem. Bad draw for both guys to be honest. This is a no-shock final anywhere in the Euro clay season. Rough. But the right guy won.
Hate when they don't show handshake.
Olé 🇪🇸
It is what it is.
Where are the Handshakes @RolandGarros ???
Thiem definitely got Ryo Shuzuke's curse.
All of you causals. Just shut up and enjoy the show. Stop taking the win and performance from Andujar
Domi needs to dump the girlfriend
You shouldnt have time for 4 minutes of highlights! Naw back ta wark ya pasants!
I dunno but Thiem doesnt want play this year at all, he stayed totally lazy and another player
Where are the press conferences?
Already busted my bracket
Roland Garros = 🇪🇸
This is why we love best of 5
After he won us open he hasn't been in the best form.  hopefully he does better next time he plays
Im worried Thiem is gonna become the 2nd coming of del Potro ... Injuries and how he just wasn't the same after his first slam.
Bravo Pablo. Impresionante!!!
I think there is definitely something wrong with him mentally. Yes he is not a 100% physically either after that slight injury earlier in the year but Thiem's head seems to never been totally focus in most of his matches this year. Hopefully he gets it together in time to defend his US Open title.
After beating Federer, everything is possible. I guess tennis is a matter of talent, hard work and strong mentality.
Thiem needs to start writing out his thoughts like he used to do on facebook years ago.  He wrote stuff and it reminded of this character from a Nickelodeon tv series Doug was it?  Can anyone refresh my mind, greatly appreciated!
Hello Roland Garros youtube team! Great images, great selection of best balls, great tournament..only one kindly suggestion: could you please stop writing the name of the winner ALWAYS in the first place in the video tittle (at least in every match since 2019). I think we prefer to keep the incertitude while we see the summary. Thanks my cartesian friends! :)
Thiems level at the 2020 ATP finals was  crazy good. His game has completely fallen apart in 2021.
3 comments in 1 - The title of the video - Dominic Thiem - Battling with the curse of Ryo Shusuke...  The 1st point of highlights doesn't seems like Thiem... Did he change his style  That point at 2:50 by Andujar is so lit🔥.
It's shocking the 2020 conquerer Dominic Thiem lose. Pablo Andujar the spoiler of fun but he deserve the win I gotta say.
Homeboy hit that backhand return hard every single point instead of just slicing it. When you can't get one return in the court from the backhand you don't continue to do the same. IQ<100 from thiem
Several backhands that I feel Thiem could have come over with topspin instead. I guess he didn't feel that confident. As several has stated before, he is a player that needs rhythm and matches to get into form. The fact that he barely played means he's not match tough.
Once a few years ago, many predicted that Thiem will be the successor of Nadal's reign at RG. He was called as the prince of clay. But I think that he can't compare with Rafa because Rafa's worst result was the fourth round in 2009 to Soldering but Thiem was first round.
Please Domi, do not become another Dimitrov who could not find his former self after winning atp finals back in 17
Atleast they could go for 4 minutes video for a 4 plus hours match
Тим официально больше не «ПРИНЦ» грунта
What an effort from Andujar, it seems that win over Roger really helped him. At least his confidence
Keep the good work with these highlights Roland Garros!!
Congratulations Pablo Andujar!
to short.what is this...
why the heck is the camera moving all the time
4.5 hrs into 3.5 mins
The court seems utterly slow, but maybe it's just me
Another year another 3 minutes 5 set match highlights. Keep up the good work.
I can’t believe Thiem almost pulled the upset over GOATdujar
Annnnd Nadal’s 21 is that much closer y’all.
trashgen
Thiem looks super sloppy. He doenst look on it
This new moaning at ever swing needs to stop!
super
Hey guys can you pls STOP showing the winner in the thumbnail?
Pablo Andujar has a similar style to Tommy Robredo, just with a two handed backhand.
2 shocks here   1.) Thiem's loss 2.) Roland Garros highlights exceeding 3 minutes! - wow we might even get a 4 minute Final match highlight reel
For me he really was the most enjoyable to watch on tour the last couple of years because of his offensive and agressive style of tennis. What the heck is going on this season?
very sad
Dominic Thiem's form in 2021 is proof that tennis is almost 80% mental. Technique, talent and physical condition helps for sure, but he just isn't the same player from last year or even 2019 when he was a beast (on clay at least) and even challenging Nadal in the RG final after beating Djokovic in the semis. And when you play a clay court specialist and a guy who has been getting good results with confidence like Andujar, yeah. No suprise at all for me of his loss.
Andujar never gave up. That’s a great attitude
Pablo excelente muy bueno... Por la victoria  a por otra;con todas.
Naomi Osaka’s match highlights? Is The French Open so butthurt and passive aggressive to not post her highlights because the biggest women’s tennis player now doesn’t want to do press conferences?
And Thiem thought bo5 would help him😅
Dominic doesn’t seem as motivated now that he’s won a slam.
Is Thiem burnt out? That loss will sting, although Andujar is no scrub.
3:31 , five sets? This is shit
People saying Theim's out of form since US open, not surprised. He won his major and that's all he wanted unfortunately. Can't motivate a satisfied mind. Unlike Nadal or Djokovic, he's not an ultra competitive freak who wants to be the best. Which is a healthy trait to have. Hope he retires and has fun outside of tennis because he obviously doesn't want to keep playing
No matter what Dominic is great Guy and great  Player.
this is a bad omen...
I feel really bad for Dominic, he just seems to have lost it after the atp finals of last year.
Nicee thank you RG
New year, new short af highlights which don't cover the crucial points.
Andujar is playing really well now at 35, beat Federer and now Thiem
3.5 minute first round highlights? They’ve upgraded.
I want the old Dominic back who was putting all his passion in every single point :(
Thiem - Nadal’s slayer in Roland Garros? NO WAY.
Austrian Media called Andujar a Nobody today.. idiots
Yeah another RG for Rafa ggs everybody 🤝🤝
His strokes just have too much topspin. You can see on so many of these shots that he’s absolutely crushing the ball but his opponent can still handle it because it takes so long for it to cross the court
Suddenly, Federer losing to Andujar doesn't seem so bad.
Pablo is a good clay court player but this was still very unexpected
I'm so sad bro
La primera sopresa de roland garros 2021
Thiem isn't the same :(
Theim Started strong, but became wobbly, what is going on with him
