NOTIFICATION SQUAD: Connor being kidnapped and a 1980's style workout montage!? Don't miss the gems in this video.
Why are you Malcom in the Middle?
Regarding your health issues, I'm 52 yo, and I wish someone had told me decades ago that sticking to a carnivore diet as strictly as possible would solve all of my issues. So, I'm not telling you what to do but consider giving it a shot one of these days if all else fails. Try five days straight of eating nothing but meat, fish, eggs and animal fats, nothing to drink but water. If after five days you don't feel tons better I'll eat my collection of beanies. The longer you keep going the better you'll feel and look. Good luck!
I mean in general young ppl are drinking less alcohol because they know the effects done come from abusive family's
What is that neon display that is right next to you? I want that exact one now lol
12:46
MAKE THE CHRISTMAS CAROL!!!!!!!
2 years later 😅, but I must note > finally realistic video about working/ training 😂❤. It remains me when I'm in gym or running outside. 😭😂 It's really awesome you decide doing that for yourself for your health 🎉
does tippsysake deliver to Scotland?
Sinister? No its a culture experience!
Hm. Jokes about sadism and literally a second later displays contempt for his girlfriend and delight in humiliating her. I like most of the videos but he is definitely someone women should avoid.
Super-lay-tivs? SuPERlatives, doncha know!
If Pete has. YT channel I would sub to that....but twitch? Pass....
I don't know how I've missed this video until now. It's got some great advice, insights,band stories. Congratulations on shifting your commitment to your health.
??? superlative is pronounced "soo-puh-luh-tuhv" NOT "super-la-tive"
What is the meaning of life?
What's the point though? Surely the Japanese are smart enough to realise that if everything is amazing then nothing is.
Where’s the Christmas Carol?
Chris the trick is to praise the food but mention something else as being your favorite or mention that something else they made was even better.  This  subtle points the chef towards what you really like, while not insulting what you tried.  Its indirect criticism of what you had as not being quite as good as something else, even though you think it was "good".  You will see Japanese people do this sometimes where they praise the food but then go on to talk about foods they really love as a flow of conversation making mention of their absolute favorites.  Smart chefs like one sushi chef who was preparing sushi for me, would present me with two dishes at once and ask which i preferred, then narrowing down what I really like and what my preferred taste was.  It was a great experience by the Kamogawa river, in Kyoto.  Taking a lesson from this, you might want to order two small dishes and praise them both but praise the one you truly do like far more than the one you like less.
Japan banned foreigners for 225 years.....2 isn't so bad!
"Yes, please, do it again in my mouth."  -Chris Broad
Omg I never knew u loved a christmas carol!!!! It's literally my fav thing ever and if I could pay u a million to do ur own version I would 😭😭😭😭😭
This 2022 video is a bit nostalgic in a weird way, there are still virus surges in my country until early 2023. This is a time when people are still unsure if the pandemic has ended or not.
I have a philosophical question: Do you think the average Japanese person thinks about the meaning of their life and how meaningful their occupation really is during their daily routine? for reference check the narration of ReLife anime.
Abroad in a Pan sounds cool!
What is the meaning of life?
Your way of presenting is great! Your videos and photos make me feel like I am there.
good video commenting for the algorithm
I've got a philosophical question: What do you think about multiple dimensions? I think it's true but idk. Please ask Natsuki too!
I'm a temple student at the main campus in Philadelphia. I wish I could visit the tokyo campus
I guess my question would be why not take up a Japanese sport??? It would actually be really interesting to see!
Yes not locking bathroom door is embrrasing and I accidentally checked out some ass first visit in Japan. It was indeed "OH! NO!".
I definitely appreciate the cinematography you put in. Great job
Thats not how you say superlative
Hey Chris Just wanted you to know that you inspired me to get fit again.   I am a guy in his mid fifties and gained a lot of weight during Covid and the years after.  Since February I have lost about 30 lbs.  I have another 60 or so to go to get back down to a good weight so still a long way to go but I thought you should know that you making your @struggle” public helped at least one person.
Misleading title.
How much does Connor charge for voice acting? I'm developing an indie game and I will be paying for voice overs.
People have been calling you fat for the past ten years, but I actually think your body type is really attractive and suits you.
Garbage Gustation Group
Great video <3
Japan school hand out awards for perfect attendance - means all pupils who never missed a day get it. I guess during the Corona Pandemic no one got one. GOOD. They stop REALLY stop giving awards to children going ILL into school. How crazy is that!! But if you learn you get rewarded going ill to school, you will go ill to work later too - and spread deceases even more.
is this a kick boxer reboot??
wow it's my dream to train by sensei Nicholas Pettas, lucky you!
ABROAD IN A PAN
5:47 if you like these cartoon illustrations, go look for a 90's Nissan or Infiniti factory vehicle service manual.  The whole manual is illustrated with sad, happy or dead personified car parts and tools with eyes and limbs.  I loved reading them working on cars back in the day
As a person who worked in addiction counseling, encouraging ppl to drink is….not a good idea.
Did you get your haircut done in North Korea Just wondering😮 Love the blog big thumbs up😮
Please do  Abroad in Japan, Christmas, Carol.
been trying to find the song starting at 1:05, I know I've seen it before but I cannot find it in my watch history.
Interesting, I always knew I had a British mind - even though I am a Brazilian xD  I also HATE the click bait method, however, as a designer I also know that it is what works =( I actually took a while to click on your videos, but I did when I got tired of reading every time I wanted to see a video from Japan  and absolutely hate the "influencer" term, looks like ppl have to mind of their own and worship someone online, it is awful :P I tend to avoid those too xD
How about Mardi Gras in Japan ?
That poster was obviously showing the horror of a guy who was dropping the kids at the pool and blocked the toilet. Now that's deserving of an "OH NO"¡
You need an Irish fella… I’m available’
It is kinda sad that you have to constantly be positive and praise people or you aren't allowed to offer criticism to superiors. Some times hearing the truth can hurt but it can help you grow and become a better person (or better at your job, like chef). But if people just praise you all the time no matter what, you remain mediocre.
You sound a little rude to me. In my country we say, "Kindly go F yourself", because  we're not animals.
Comment😂🎉
I really like if he is buing stockfootage.
Your 32 I'm 35 😂 anyway I think you are attractive and healthy looking, but I understand wanting to get in shape ever since I've had my daughter, I've been trying to get back in shape... 😂 not being very successful at it but it's a work in progress. I think  you are very lucky to live in Japan. I've always wanted to live there or at least visit.
If you are looking for some walking/hiking, check out the Shikoku pilgrimage route. It goes around the whole island and takes you by some amazing scenery and temples. I think that would make a super cool video as well.
これからも日本の批判を是非頑張って頂きたい 肯定的な話よりも否定的な話の方が危険な人に対する良いフィルターになりそうです
Please do an Abroad in Japan Christmas Carol someday-that would rock!
Instead of just taking the "stomach like mount Fuji " comments, tell them how you are training up your inner Sumo.
This was the start of Affable Chris
Wait Japan closed its borders? I dident even know that xD
Mate, I love your videos but please learn the correct pronunciation of superlative.  A pedantic fan.
his eyes told me something :" he is like me , drinking too much over the  pass years. " I was ripped,  now over weighted. lets stop this nonsense and get ripped again.
Chris I love you. I almost wrote Christ I love you, both are true and the same
the clickbait titles like this one? 🤣
I really respect your outlook on YouTube thumbnails and titles. I have never been a fan of them, but I get it. You are forced to become something you aren’t because of the algorithm. It’s an easy thing to look past for the quality of this channel.
Not too long after the release of this video Japan reopened their borders and Chris did about a 1 hour livestream talking about that, and answering several questions from the chat. That VOD used to be up but now I can't find it. Does anyone know what happened to it?
"In my mouth do it again" 😂 Chris is too keen
I dont get the fat jokes hes not even fat, he has an normal body🤷‍♀️
Good on you Chris for focusing on yourself. You deserve it after working on your channel for so long. And of course you can get in shape! If my fat ass did it, anyone can do it.
Abroad in a christmas carol 2023!
2:39 I don’t drink but oh boi those sake’s looks slick
This dude comes across really genuine and honest. Rarely seen with online personas.  Was interesting hearing about his views on his own thumbnails.
You have  quickly gained weightn
Hey man i love that you're gettin fit. Awesome work Dave, uh, i mean, Chris
SOOOOOO BORING
The last shot in this video would be the thumbnail to end thumbnails.
Who cares? I’ve been to Japan six times and don’t have time for your 🐮💩
There are too many foreigners here in Japan already. We don’t need more of them.😂
The fact that certain industries have allegedly collapsed due to no international tourism surprises me. I've been to the most popular parts of Tokyo and Kyoto over the past 10 years and literally 99% of the people that are visiting these tourist places are native Japanese. I'd honestly say it's more likely that a lack of desire to travel for native residents has been a bigger cause.
I love the fitness motage!! the timing for the music was amaziong! I also relate, my fitness, being terrible atm too. It';s actually kinda inspiring me to get up and start working out! Thanks for the amazing videos! Hope you are well! XD (best wishes from England! )
i mean i like ur vids but you DO look like every white guy that goes to japan lol... like very weeby. kinda flabby, ever so little lack of awareness on how the discrimination you experience is a TINY drop of what other asian people experience in western countries. etc. but you do a good job.
I thought the shot was brilliant for the deserted place.  Reminds me of last of us the game.
"yes please do it again, in my mouth"- Chris Broad 2022
Oh gosh, 100% with you. I hate the funny faces thumbnails as well. I think, I've been a subscriber for a really long time (on my other account) and that's definitely not the thumbnails that got me to click. And I'm grateful I knew your channel before that, because I tend to avoid all those thumbnails; they creep me out. Unless I really want that information as I watch more informative content than entertainment content or just music. Gotta have the music while working on those thumbnails!
If there are such barriers for foreigners from first world countries, imagine for us poor Latin Americans. LoL. But even so I love Japanese culture, and I really want to be friends with these people. Here in Brazil we still hug any newly met tourist, share a bunch of beers, share any available hole in the house for the newly met friend to sleep in after a hangover, and then get drunk again. Can I look forward to a similar experience when I visit Japan?
Can you do a video on the Yazuka?
I kinda avoid clicking clickbaity thumbnails unless I have already seen videos from channel or topic of video over powers my annoyance at thumbnail, but I guess youtube won't reccomend videos to me unles they already got lot of views :p
tip for your challenge about fitness: 80% food and 20% sport. The food count the most, you can get away without sport but not without food. Be careful what you eat and all will be ok. Also drinking alcohol... NOT!
I LOVE Ken Wantanabi! He could be wearing rags and still look like a GQ cover. Oh yeah…and he’s also a great actor. I hope he NEVER retires.
I see you do a ton of main and Japan. What about Okinawa? It's almost another country!
Late comment, but I find it funny so here:   Look, if we really want Japan to open the borders, there’s only one thing to do: get yourself an ironclad.
...I'm guessing the answer is that they are one of the most racist societies on the planet. But I am generalizing of course.
Great channel thank you for the vids. Always wanted to go to Japan but i don't speak Japanese so i get scared
I’m only here for a few minutes. You should have an opening statement on ever blog on how the hell you’re sustaining lomg term visa in Japan. It’s gotta be some twisted BS since westerners cannot obtain a long term visa.
You don't have to be a twat on YouTube. Those titles and thumbnails actively make sure I don't click the video
Would love to see more hotel / villa reviews!
I just got back from my trip from Japan as a tourist in December, I’m so thankful they opened back up for us 🙏 had a great visit
First step to being healthy, watch the documentary  fat head
Oh. I gotta agree. Kyoto was crowded as hell before the pandemic. Didn't enjoy much with the amount of people there. I always prefer spacious places with less people.
... paid promo, waffle, click bait.... 😴🙄
Hi Chris. I understand this video is 3months old but it just popped up in nmy feed. You’r jokes like ”abroad in a pan” and the bit about exaggerating compliments made me realise, that although I appreciate Japanese culture, I absolutely adore the British witty, sarcastic and clever sense of humor. Thank you and have happy new year! 😊
I was just watching a muppet Christmas carol and thought it would be pretty good to adapt to japan, but only if the goal was tto be as Japanese as possible.
I'm the same age as you, and I get it. This year is the first year where the physical effects of age have just barely started to creep around the corner, and it has me really thinking a lot about my health. Man, getting old is stressful.
Your videos are great mate, don't apologise for click bait - it's a part of the the job, every thumbnail creator applies the same logic to their designs in the hope of increasing humbnail click throughs rates  etc
12:20 is actually much sadder than it even appears at first glance.  That whole "put the stuff I like and think is cool on YT" is literally the founding idea of the platform. Creativity and just having fun and sharing that experience with the world; THAT is what Youtube used to stand for.  And nowadays they choke you out of the platform if you don't conform to their obnoxious practices which let you earn the money to keep making content until you're burnt out and leave. Cool.  And other channels lean way too hard into that "algorithm mindset" and essentially just melt their personality and their flair in favor of making more money. That shit just sucks. I've had to leave so many channels and groups behind that I used to LOVE, because their content drastically changed for purely monetary gain and relevance on the platform.  Hell, the current dogshit trend of shoving shorts in everyone's face, so half your subscription box is just 30 second clips, because "ya gotta jump on the bandwagon" is a prime example. It's uninspired, boring content, that goes nowhere and just serves to entice the audience that YT has been almost exclusively been catering to for way too long now - children.
SMELLYMANCHEESE?  If that means what I think it does then why would someone call themselves that?
That is awesome Chris!! Way to go and keep it up. You can absolutely do this. 💪👏
I can actually hear sharla's "oh f*ck off!" to that picture even here in America. 😂
12:30 I've always avoided this channel for the exact reason. The thumbs always looked scammy like some mega weaboo trap. Now I'm subbed.
I'm To brutally honest I would give every Japanesea heart attack with how harshly critical I can be but when I compliment it's genuine
No such thing as constructive criticism in Japan eh?
6:16 based on all my first hand anime knowledge no locks in Japan don’t work 😂😂
booking a trip for next year and had no idea about the chaperone thing, to restrict us based on the fact we're from another country after the necessary covid bans are over is kinda xenophobic tbh.
the round schoolhouse, it looks like it was used as a scene in elfen Lied
"Your stomach like mount Fuji" 🤣🤣  You're fat. You can't run fast, you can't play football ⚽ I knew it.
Bloody Hell Chris - that photo of you teaching You Tube stuff at Temple University! You are the spit of Vince Gilligan, the genius creator of Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul. Love your channel, which I have just discovered. I spent two years living in Sapporo back in 1998 - way before You Tube was invented of course. Met and married a Japanese lass who moved back to the UK with me in 2000. I share your love of Japanese fried chicken that she makes just like her Okasan did. You are most welcome to come over for a bite if you ever find yourself peckish and near Egham.
U-no!     (Oh!!! No!!!)
Sometimes he makes the Japanese sound like Minnesotans __ phony over the top niceness mixed with passive-aggressiveness
Chris: YES PLEASE DO IT AGAIN IN MY MOUTH! 9:26
Funniest thing I've ever read in bathroom was. " Don't bother to cover the seat, port-o-let crabs jump 10 feet". 😂😂
Super-lative...LMAO...
Bro said abroad in a pan, killed me in a donation center
Imagine making this type of advertising in the eu 🤪
I've worked my teenage to young adult life in hopes of working and living in Japan. With recent events taken into consideration...Is it all that feasible anymore?( I'm 24 now)
Praising stuff all the time, I wouldn't want to to do that at all. Only when you actually mean it, otherwise what is the point?  Are you going to do " Abroad in a Fan"? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Was having a bad day and this made me laugh, thanks Chris!
Hasn't that lifted now?
As someone who loves japanese culture and would like to live there, i think japan is right in making it difficult for foreigners to enter. Look at all the lunacy that is happening in the west mostly due to political correctness, entitlement and pure narcissism. To meny people in the west cannot mind their own business and have a need to push what they think is good morals on others.
Blur out their names. Do not give haters a stage
Oh  oonoe
6:04 Kenneth Williams eat your heart out.
So many countries wrecking their own futures for the sake of the older generations. This, to me is the most shameful and selfish thing we can do. We should be trying to strengthen and broaden the minds and increase the opportunities for the next generation, this is the most humane, smart and forward thinking thing to do. But since the last world war, it is like generations of humans are only looking after their own interests, and too often even at the expense of their own kids. Awful and ashamed of my peers and even older. ( I am older btw so this is not just someone looking for gibs). When my time comes it comes. By all means move heaven and earth to protect your loved ones, but not at the expense of children. Foolish and shameful.
I've been living in Denmark for 10 years. They're also overly enthusiastic about food. It's almost expected to say the food smells good when you first smell it, then pronounce that it tastes good when eating (usually after the first bite).  When I first ate with my wife's family she had to ask me in front of them if it tasted good (which it did, amazing in fact) so they knew I liked it.  I think that English culture is the problem here and that it may be normal to be overly emphatic when being served food in other countries. This of course has the problem that you never really know how good the food is because everything tastes great according to the people eating 😂
Huh? How did Bald get in Japan then? Did he con us and go to some post Soviet Japan town?
Japan has made a mess of the tourism. I used to live there and I am 100% disappointed with Japan. I have had tickets to go for the last 3 years and have had to cancel it again and again.
Mate, been a fan of yours for some time now! I think you look great, really healthy and I’m glad you’re happy. I’ll be visiting Japan for the month of May and looking forward to it ☺️.
After touring Japan last September I've become totally obsessed in everything Japanese . Absolutely love all your videos , just brilliant .
"Do it again in my mouth" XD
I think the clickbait titles and thumbnails get the most views because they’re what got views back in the day so that’s what people started using. Then the people who make half decent videos and get consistent views keep using them and keep getting views so it keeps feeding the numbers that say those things get clicks and it just gets bigger and bigger.
Pretty Soon You Will Learn The "DIN MAK"
Dammit, I took a sip of drink right at "smelly mancheese."  Nearly did a spit take.
"Mediocre Youtuber" making fat stacks and having fun creating the content. This guy is doing in right!
Hey Chris, what's up? it's always interesting to see you balancing your comments in your videos attempting to be a comedian 🥸. Honestly, they are lots of fun, so keep going. After 6 years, I left Japan in february 2022 but haven't stopped watching you crush Connor and getting fit among others. I especially enjoyed the Troyan race, lol. Keep it up, spartan and hopefully one day I will thank you in person. Cheers.
If the culture of Japan is to praise everything why don't i see that happening in Animes??
6:26 Chris+Elon child looks more like 7/10, but what I am most curious about is , she looks asian, while you two dont :D
I've been subscribed for a long time. I got my sons watching your utube channel. I told them that your cool. They agree with me. I'm almost 💯 right. To me your 😎
Love your work!😎😎😎💓💓💓(Your comment: “…unbearable…” = such a ‘Dad joke’!😂😂😂) And - pardon……..did you just (mis)pronounce the word: superlatives??? Mmmmmmmm - not quite! (And - yes = to your Christmas idea = obviously to be called: “A Christmas Carol Nightmare”!🎄🎄🎄)
How bald and bankrupt arrived Japan then?
You don't look overweight at all
10 years….well done
Thank you for sharing your health concers with complete strangers.  I'll try and get on board with my health too.  👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Your prediction on the reopening was so spot on. I'm enjoying your videos in prep and hype for my upcoming trip that I have dreamed of since I was 12. (I'm a year older than you). Going to Kyoto but have a rail pass to take train trips wherever I get influenced to visit. Probably by videographers on social media. ;)
Hey Chris, you looking a bit less chubby now... are we supposed to call you Ripped the Big now?
If the Japanese culture is always superlative, how does one person / restaurant / etc improve?
I can’t wait to get back to Japan I was stationed in Yokosuka back in 95-97 and the last thing I’d want to do is be on a guided tour.
Muppets has the best Christmas Carol EVER!!!!
'Do it again, in my mouth' 🤔
Chris-mas carol
Almost 3 million subscriber like you just fine! Haters gonna hate...
I went to Japan for a week when I was 14 and still remember laughing at SUPERDRUG pharmacies which seemed to be everywhere. That was almost 20 years ago now but I'm sure the country is even more of a joy to visit
What is your ideal 2 week japan itinerary for first time traveler's?
Connor gets hitman-ed by agent Chris.
<3
I don't comment often but, I really enjoyed how you tried to sync the training montage with the BGM!! WWWW
glad your still around after 10 years loved the questions and the answers  and I'm happy to hear that you are putting physical and mental health first
I understand not wanting foreigners in your country, but in that case restrict working visas and the like, tourism is such a huge part of economies in europe, and with a little effort in advertising and a deal with an airline or two it'd really boost the economy
Yes please do it again in my mouth 😅🤣🤣 this is funny
I'm going in a month and I cannot wait! Glad they resumed tourism.
I feel like the Japanese government is just throwing ANYTHING at the wall of ideas on how to raise Japan's population problem at this point. We've gotten to the point now where their encouraging late night drinking, Hentai Anime shows, Whole "Family" Anime and the idea of robot companions. This isn't stuff that encourages healthy relationships this encourages HERMIT life style! Japan (and the rest of the world) need to realize you can't force people to work all hours of the day and expect them to to go out and find love! Housing is too expensive, dating is too expensive, CHILDREN are too expensive and they expect you to have a healthy lifestyle with a nuclear family, which is impossible unless your rich! So heres how we fix it all. Raise pay rates so employees can work less hours, interchange with other employees which raises jobs, employees then can save disposable cash to go on dates and MAYBE find a relationship to MAKE DA BABIES! Of course big business doesn't want any of that so we're all screwed.
omgg I'm in tears. I've been watching you for SO LONG now and I can't believe it's been 10 years. I wasn't here for the whole time but Your channel makes me so happy. They're informative and inspiring. I will try my best to workout and be better this year too! You def should be their fourth member and def do the christmas carol thing XD
12:20  I am surprised you haven't posted a video with a thumb nail labelled "For fuck's sake just watch this damn video".  I would watch that over and over again.  LOL
Come visit Alaska. We have cute "little" bears too. 🐻
Lucky for me I was given a Japanese Visa as a visiting Professor. Lucky for me before the border opened up in early October I was the only foreigner here,.
Christmas carol would awesome
Chris, that fitness montage at the end? Perfection. The way you timed the punches to the beats 🤌🤌
Congratulations. Happy Anniversary. Has it been that long. Wow I remember when you first started.
Glad Japan opened up! Going there in February!
Abroad in Japan AMV
Abroad in Japan Christmas Carol. Please?
youre not even overweight tho
Just take bearspray and make noise and you be allright...
"The Influencer" sounds like a diabolical mind control device in a Sci Fi  B movie.
Zamn no chance for abroad in a pan
Better than the Last Supper? In fairness, most suppers are better than the Last Supper.
Please do the Christmas special!
It's open again now if any hasn't noticed.
That boxing montage was so badass 🔥
isn't living in Japan supposed to make you thinner?
Congratulations on 10 years. There were many great videos throughout the years. Cool video. ^_^
Congrats on 10 years
Make abroad in Japan christmas  Carol
Super Laytivs?  Took me a while to realise you were saying ‘superlatives’… 😂 Love the vids: “inform, educate and entertain”, are you sure you’re not working for the BBC?!
Thankfully the country is reopening back up
RE: Workouts. If its hard to do, its probably worth doing.
Isnt the border reopening on oct 11th?
The bit with Conner was golden💀😂
It's not an 80's fitness video unless you are wearing a leotard and knitted leg warmers...
omg Abroad in Japan Christmas Carol would be great.  Please cast all your current co-stars. Also put a Japanese spin on the original story.  10/10 would watch.
If I was Sharla I'd sue💀😂
8:15 I guess Rengoku from demon slayer was a satire of this
Actually on 11th of October Japan will open again for regular individual tourism as well again! Finally!
The editing for the montage was actually godlike, way better than most I've seen on movies, you are awesome, man, love your content. By the way, If  i ever visit japan i will find out where you live and stalk your ass HA HA HA HAAAAAAA (EVIL LAUGHTER, BY THE WAY)
9:26 Pause 😂
Lmao that montage was pure entertainment and absolute beauty
Chris please let Connor go, he did nothing wrong...
GIVE US THE ABROAD IN A MERRY SEASON pls . Would love to see your take on a Christmas // movie or parody of it: D
your thumbnails are great chris
honestly? smartest guy on youtube after joey the anime man joey op
GET AT IT CHRIS!!! I WANT YOU TO BECOME AN ADONIS!!!
love to see the christmas video / short film it be fun.
An entertaining youtuber... A nice white guy's privileged life... ?
I want Abroad In A Pan
Your trainer looks kinda like Sylvester Stallone.
youre an inspiration dude love the content and that training arc <33
It's not SUPERL(ay)TIVE YOU DILL!!!
Going solo in April  Can’t wait
His child with Elon Musk is actually really pretty… what are you on about Chris 😂
Is it just me or does Chris seem more...sane?
Incredible.
Super latives!
Japanese people: sugoi, delicious, amazing! British people: it's good but it needs some pepper Italians: what the fuck it's that? Cream in carbonara? It's disgusting!
It’s very unfortunate the way things are with thumbnails and such. I’ve been browsing YouTube since the beginning and I genuinely prefer videos and titles that aren’t the current weird face meta.
I'm actually really glad the more replayed part of the video is also what Chris says is his more enjoyable part of shooting these videos.  It actually is a joy to see such amazing shots of Japan, so thanks for being so intentional about that!
Lol I hate those Vick bait at least you admit there fucked lol 😂
If you come to Furano on your bike trip I'd love to show you around. Or if you want a physical challenge revolving around climbing mountains in Daisetsuzan, reach out and I can help you with planning or logistics! Can climb in winter if you're really keen for a challenge :)
Now I need Journey across Japan 5: Gym & Box with the final episode having Ryosuke from Champ’s Japanese Kitchen as a final boss…
😂👍
Well this didn't age well 🤣
Quit drinking alcohol, and have a healthy lifestyle. Love and Respect
Cortisol is not good for health. Those challenges are nothing but cortisol inducing.
What happened to the rest of journey across japan? Its been a month man.
You need to go to that round school for Halloween!! Please!!
amazing ❤
6:26 i dont understand whatchu mean? (s)he's pretty attractive
we have bears in canada, just travel in pairs or more, make a lot of noise, the bears will go some where else
but chris, arnt you suppost to be eating healther and drinking less :P
will we see your girlfriend on the channel ? and who do you hang out with, when you are not hanging out with connor ? have a good day :)
guess what. japan is open to foreigners without tours in oct
Naming videos to such clickbaity titles instead of what they actually are is pretty stupid in my opinion. You may attract new people a bit better but your audience clicks on your videos less. If you title something "Journey across Japan" the subs will all click on it and also this video: I didnt click on it for 3 weeks because of the shitty title instead of just Anniversary Q&A or something. Saying its demanded to act like that so that the channel isnt dying is just stupid and Im sure Im not the only one who thinks like that.
I love the sound mastering in the workout montage, and the timing Slowing down on certain actions to give them more force, that's just sublime
Upload the next Okinawa episode already, PLEASE!  It's been a month :(
I was curious to what soapland was about but now i cant look back
The boxing montage makes a lot of sense in retrospect lol.
Chris needs to make an entire video where he ONLY talks in his stupid comment reading voice :P
The majority of your ideas go to the bin? Do you do this because you enjoy it? Or is it for the paycheck? I gete neeeded to make a living, but I feel like, once in a while, putting something up that won't make the mortgage would be cool, if it's something ytou actually WANT to do...
Hey good luck against papaplatte. 😅 he's gonna be an easy one 🥊
Love about how you talk about putting your mental and physical health at the fore while holding sake
I hate tourists. People that come to Hawaii are so disrespectful and fat and have no respect for the anybody
looks like Chris' video worked
Hi, Chris. Since you've started with the bad comments review... Could you do the good comments once in a while, please?  Here's one for you: You are awesome. Entertaining and witty. And I love your "exploration" videos of Japan. Please keep up the great work.
What’s your favourite alcoholic drinks in Japan and some you wouldn’t recommend
You wanted me to pm you on this channel . I like your videos on japan
I love so much about Japan and Japanese culture, but these past few years have highlighted the nasty, conservative xenophobia that's still beneath the surface. It's really sad. The country is falling into ruin because of it and it's still there. And as for the average person not even being aware of the bans? That's... frustrating. It shows they literally don't even care. They're happy to ignore it and let it continue.
The word you’re thinking of for the abandon buildings is liminal spaces
Are you gonna start your YouTube boxing career ?
where’s the next vid bruh
I ALWAY Appreciate the good Drone shots. I have a DJI Mini 2, that I take with me on all my vacations. It's not easy to Fly and Make a shot look good at the same time. It's easy to just fly around for the fun of it, and it's easy to get a good still, it's not so easy to get a good moving cinematic shot.
I'm going to take that as a good sign for their relationship that he at least thinks he can get away with showing that picture. My GF would smack me in the giblets for even daring to think of doing such thing.
I love how the stereotypical view of America for some reason is watch out for bears and other wildlife, when you can talk to a thousand hikers and trail wonders who've at most seen them from a distance minding their own business.Japan seems to be far worse for bear encounters.
I've been watching you're videos for a while now, Its what makes me want to travel travel to Japan! I also love all the funny comments on most videos
...news looks optimistic, any day now 🤞  My flights are booked for my first visit, 3 months in Japan from Spring to Summer 2023.  Excited doesn't even start to describe it  🤩🤩🤩🤩
I'm hoping to get back over for the snow festival in Feb and some skiing in Niseko. Hopefully its opened up properly again and less masked perverts wandering about.
I am a Japanese viewer and have been enjoying the videos on your channel for about six months now. I love your critical perspective on Japan, your sarcastic humor in conveying it, and your concise, unbiased video structure.  I think your channel is one of those rare channels where both a critical perspective and a love of Japanese culture exist, and where information is not simply used as attention-grabbing content.  Thanks for always finding so many good things and improvements about Japan!  I have learned many things from you that I would not have noticed if I had just lived in Tokyo, such as how Japan looks and how Japan is misaligned from a foreigner's point of view.  Also, from you I became aware of the existence of trash taste, and from there I became even more aware of the existence of Daidus and Emirichu, all of which gave me a lot more enjoyment. Thanks for the charity bike ride with Connor!  Many problems remain, such as excessive interrogation of foreigners by Japanese police officers, Harsh working conditions, refusal to rent apartments, and refusal to allow foreigners to enter Japan, but I sincerely hope that the situation can be improved to be more comfortable for foreigners.🙏
You have nerd's neck haha
What is the silliest thing you can buy in Japan
Do it Chris we’d love A Japanese Caro
a fit in japan
You gained some weight.
I was planning to go to Japan this year, the government still isnt allowing me to travel to Japan without restrictions. So Japan's loss is Singapore's gain. Sad, but I'll go later
You absolutely need to do a remake of the Christmas carrol with the Abroad gang and friends!
I’m bored, can you ride your bike across Hokkaido again but this time going from east to west? 😂 fall foliage would be a beautiful back drop. Love your channel homie
lol
repent for the kingdom of God is at hand. choose jesus now and live forever. he is the way, the truth, and the life. if you believe and confess with your mouth that he is lord and god and that he died for your sins and live a righteous path, u will be saved.
12:46 😂😂😂
To be honest I understand the need to boost the economy, Japan is a rather self reliant country, rather than many others who would prefer to globalize. The Japanese are very proud to be Japanese. They are proud not to be serving in any wars, not entire beholden to the rest of the world for resources, largely they do the majority of the hard work for themselves by themselves and it is incredibly admirable, and the urge to boost their own economy is evident. I feel like they could do with foreigners travelling to the country to increase profits, but I do understand their mindset. It is certainly admirable, they don't NEED to let anyone is. That is the country's choice.
Why are they doing those "minder" tours like NK?
You do look like every white guy that moves to Japan… actually all of Asia actually LOL
Oh.. so that's why we magically have Sapporo Beer here in the Philippine country side. Thanks Japan.
Because they appreciate your money, and not necessarily you.
Here’s hoping you did ok through the last typhoon
Post alr jeez it's been 2 and a half weeks please uwu
have there been any other changes in the last weeks in regards of the entry rules for japan? as far as i m informed its still only possible with these guided tours is that still correct? just curious 😄
You say it's difficult having to praise everything.  I assume foreigners are viewed differently (partly) because of this.  Would you encourage a visitor to do this, or do you think the Japanese would value honest truth from ignorance of the traditions?
Oh man is that Nicholas Pettas?! So cool
It sucks that you can't visit Japan without having to follow all these restrictions.
Hi! This is a semi-related comment. If you ever get a chance to ponder this question, or maybe you have. This may initially sound extreme, but please hear me out: Is there a possibility that Japanese people may face an extinction? I'm part Japanese, I'm born and raised in America. When I see how evacuated Japan seems without tourists, only relying on its own residents- well, it's a little shocking. Then, combined with the idea that apparently fewer Japanese people are making families (or so I hear), it makes me wonder. Please forgive me if this question sounds extreme or uninformed. Surely, I don't imagine something like this happening in my lifetime- I don't think I'm going to wake up tomorrow and see this happening like "There are only 10 Japanese people left!" But if you think about things like dead languages or lost civilizations, then I'm curious since you have a first hand experience in the country and seem pretty conscious and aware of how things are generally going there, what is your take? I thought about it but I can't tell if I'm just lost in thought and creating science fiction.
German high school student here, now studying abroad for a year st a Japanese high school since August. For me, Japan is the perfect country because it fits my mentality. I waited 2 years entering Japan due to the unreasonable long travel ban which was also enacted against students until March. I think overtourism is definitely a problem in locations like Tokyo and Kyoto but closing Japan completely off for individual tourism, there's either no point in it.
Wait I didn't know you did a class at TUJ. I was there in the Spring of 2020 when all of the covid stuff went down . Go Owls.
.We love watching your videos mate .Perhaps you could do a blog about what WABI SABI is to the Japanese and your take on it .Keep them coming .
I’m always amused by people who haven’t grown up in a country with bears live, and just how overblown they make the risk of bears… As long as you take the proper precautions when hiking and camping in bear territory you will be perfectly fine…   I guess if Grizzly bears were a fraction as dangerous as Chris thinks they are I would be dead a thousand times over by now… Just keep your cooking area separate from where you sleep, don’t keep food, tooth paste and other strong smelling items where you sleep, and properly hang them in a tree with a rope overnight, observe basic bear safety precautions, and you will be fine! I camped almost every weekend in bear country as a child, saw bears many many times, kept our distance and made our presence known to the bears, and I had some of the most memorable times as a child in grizzly bear country…   It really isn’t that dangerous Chris.. You may be personally , and irrationally scared of them, but please don’t lie and overstate their dangerousness!
We Japanese viewers have been waiting impatiently for Japanese subtitles for videos after 2020.
Yo where is le NEW VIDEO 🥺🥺🥺❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
that montage makes me so happpy
Yes! A Christmas Carol in Japan will be a huge Christmas treat! Natsuki would make it so funny
UPLOAD
14:23 Another episode or short film with Watanabe Sensei.
Make a cinematography channel Chris! 🤩 Seriously though! I like your camerawork.
You need to try almond butter, chocolate and banana on bread sandwich.. Here in UK, we got sandwich snacks to a t.
As incredible as it is to see the growth of this channel's production value and quality, can't say I don't miss the days where you were still in a small house with a train that annoyed you everyday.
Please make the Abroad Christmas Story.
In an alternate universe Abroad in Korea is one of the most popular youtube channels in Korea
wait... i didnt know any country in the world allowed tourists to reside in their country for an unlimited amount of time... what country has this ?
definite yes to chrismass carol but only if Natsuki is the Scrooge and you, Ryotoro and Sharla are convincing him to stop smoking!
09:10 - I'm pretty honest with the owners / chefs at the places that I frequent and I think it has actually strengthened our friendship because they know they can count on me for an honest opinion. They will often times let me preview new menu items as a result for feedback.
Dam was so pumped to order from tippsysake just to find out it does not do international :(
They just lifted visa restrictions to visit Japan.
The borders have been closed so long, Chris forgot 7-eleven was an American company. In all fairness though, Japanese 7-elevens are far superior.   Nana chiki is king.
4:18 intersting, I didnt know the German word Poltergeist is used in English too. On the topic of Germany and England, I really love your dry sense of humour. I think, contrary to a common misconception, English and Germans share to prefer this kind of humour. Also Japan and Germany share a lot of common history and cultural similarities, so actually Germans might be your perfect audience :P , for me at least this is my favourite channel. Wondering if there are other fellow countrimen enjoying the channel. Greeting from Germany :)
They are waiting for the wano borders to open
as a man who lost 40 lbs in 3 months when i was 32, i can tell you diet is the answer. particularly fasting (at least for me) i tried for a decade to burn it off, cycling my ass off up hills etc, running, everything, it never worked until i just simply ate less. about 800 calories a day worked for me. hit me up if you have any questions, more than willing to help and give specifics.
I specifically try my best to not click surprise face thumbnail videos.
Living in China, and speaking Chinese, I have the same issues.... Having to say everything is delicious even if its gross! and with complementing too.... I totally get you, sometimes its really difficult to know "are you just saying that or do you actually mean it?" I often wonder, how would you actually express enjoyment? and how can you tell? I have heard in collectivist countries people tend to act in a more "harmonic" way, so to avoid confrontation, they don't like to disagree, they just agree, smile and hope they don't create conflict
As an englishman myself, I find it kind of bizarre when I see the positivity in Japan, it's not that England is devoid of joy and positive thoughts, even if a good 75% of the population thinks so, including myself at times, it's just because England, as a people, tend to downplay their emotional reactions, stiff upper lip isn't a joke or anything, it's a thing for English people to be really stoic and unforthcoming to extreme emotion, love is like and all that.  So seeing Japan be literally the opposite where they look like they're overreacting to everything and everyone, and it looks fake, it looks like they're faking their emotions, even if they're being genuine.
I can't believe people still write unpleasant comments. I thought they'd be over it by now.
Genuinely inspirational. Good luck with the health kick and future endeavours Chris 🙌🏻 P.s. Already looking healthier pal ;)
Thinking about my wife and I learning japan over the next few years and moving. I love Japan and watch you to keep motivation up!
Love the honesty on the algorithm here Chris. After ten years, not afraid to speak your mind. Screw the criticism. I've loved watching your work evolve over the years and it really makes me happy when I see a new video uploaded. Keep up the good work sir!
I'm coming to Japan in October to finally visit family with my wife, I had to apply for a visa to get in, needed to get our Japanese marriage certificate etc. Although the process wasn't too painful it was just time consuming. I can't wait to get back. Just discovered the channel BTW, really enjoyable.
5:25 Bwair Litch Pwojectu
I just want to go see my Freind and his family.   We are waiting so we can go.
1:55 - I guess what they meant is “get drunk and make babies”
Have you thought of posting videos to Nebula, as a cultural creator? That way, you can avoid twatty titles on at least THAT platform?
''Why Japan Still BANS Foreigners After 2 Years'' Because they're racist fucks, simple as that. Shut up weebs, it's true
great video
Hey Chris, I love your videos, they make me want to learn Japanese and live in Japan. Maybe one day this will come true. Thank you so much for inspiring this nostalgia within me.
I LOVED that beginning 😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
Hate er, i mean thank the stubborn old people making this all possible.
X-mas special please 🫶🏻
this room is such a fkn vibe
October japan will reopen and allowed individual tourist mostly go back to the pre pandemic 2019 . Won’t be long everyone who want to visit Japan can go without all the rules/restriction/visa…..
I've been watching your videos for many years and it makes me so happy that your sense of humor hasn't changed, and over the years all that's changed about your channel is the production quality getting better and better. I think the first video of yours I watched was "how to move to and work in Japan". I went to Japan when I was 13 and absolutely loved it, I always wanted to go back. I ended up moving to Taiwan, but there was always something very comforting about having the same person that got me thinking about living in Asia, being a few steps ahead of me, posting entertaining videos about life in Asia from the other side of a pond. Taiwan and Japan are more similar than I imagined, in a good way. I'll be coming to Japan for the first time since then next year hopefully, if the council of Japanese elders deem it wise to properly re-open Japan. P.S. you should start doing more workout videos because like you I'm getting 'broad' 🤣
What I'm gonna write might appear dumb but I truly experienced it. I have travelled 18 countries so far. I'm currently touring Japan (my 19th country) and its my first time here. I visited various places such as Narai-juku post town, Matsumoto Castle, Nara, Kyoto, Osaka, Kobe, Hiroshima. The list can go on because its been for more than 25 days so far.   My strange experience happened in Tokyo (3 km) to the city centre. I stayed in a hotel in Tokyo for 4 nights and every night ''I HAD THE MOST SCARIEST NIGHTMARE I EVER EXPERIENCED. I MEAN THE DREAMS I EXPERIENCED IN THAT HOTEL IS SOMETHING THAT I NEVER HAPPENED in my entire life. I usually don't dream and even if I do, its usually easy kinda stuff. Those 4 nights have been so horrifying. I'm still not clear of the reason because I'm neither on a strange medication nor intoxicated. This never happened in any other places in Japan or any countries I travelled.
Im STILL waiting to visit Japan. Was planning a trip the past 2 Septembers....
"Yes please! Do it again! In my mouth!" Needs to be a gif.
yooooo sick fade bro.
Honestly, I would love to see your Christmas Carol remake.
I have family in Kyoto.  One of them is pretty involved with tourism and spoke with the city manager of tourism and Kyoto is bankrupt.  Japan needs to open up.
You look like uncooked pancake batter
Where is my journey to Hokkaido??? ;(
Like when I cook for other people I want them to tell me if there is something that I could fix, like constructive criticism, if they think it could literally just do with more pepper I would want to know and it's not like you can add pepper after the fact to a lot of stuff because it just isn't the same as having it cooked in.
actually national geographic guided tours are very nice because of course they are, they are national effing geographic, expensive tho...
That intro😂😂😂😂😂😂
Please do it.  I think it would turn out great!
I had a month long trip booked to Japan when the corona first hit, now, with the Japanese Government playing politics over tourists, all I can say is F**K YOU. I hope you go f**king bankrupt.
We're glad that you're moving onto a healthier lifestyle. We can already see the results and wish you a safe and awesome bike trip ahead! My wife and I really enjoy your videos, thank you very much!
Loved it lol
The cinematography in your videos are one of them main reasons I watch your videos. They give me a lot of inspiration for my own work. And the abandoned Island shot was beautiful. Joey needs to take a note out of your book for making great looking videos.  Good luck on your fitness journey and I can't wait to see what you come up with next.
Having just checked out Connor's channel for the first time... I must say that Chris is by Far the better Narrator and Editor. Great Job Chris!
What if I’m a foreigner and I want to move to Japan where would I live what’s the best place to live for cheap
make that christmas Carol!
shars gonna sick her cats on u
Here is your excuse.  Some guy on the internet said he wanted me to.
PLEASE DO CHRISTMAS CONTENT!
Hi Chris! So, I’ve been seeing a lot of stuff on social media lately about Chichibugahama Beach near Mitoyo on the Kagawa Prefecture. As a film maker, I feel like you would have such a lovely time experiencing that place!
Well I’m never going to Japan lol looks like I’ll take my money to south korea
Congrats on starting your fitness journey
very nice video, as always. Keep up the good work, Oishi! But I found it a bit weird how you pronounced "superlative". Is that something you picked up in Japan, maybe?  The quality of the videos is always increasing, good job!
Does this ban also ban foreign exchange students?
They are giving out 0% alcohol to youths 🤣 my friend was offered one yesterday
I'm from London, just arrived in Japan on a spouse visa and was a pretty frustrating process to get here. Drop me a message if you want to meet up 👍🏻
i fu*cking love your channel. Your an example for high quality content on youtube. please never stop making content
Idk if Cdawg is a good VA. he just has a good voice. He hasn't shown any range in his entire career.
めっちゃ面白い🤣 良い英語の勉強になりそう
See what Logan Paul has done to us! That's why we can't have nice things.
I'm really happy you are taking health issues seriously, Chris, but I do want to say one thing: Don't stress over it TOO much. Too many people think that a slim and trained body is getting you everything you need, that mindset can really cost you a good bit of mental health. Being healthy is not about being the fittest you you could ever be, being healthy is about enjoyment and happiness. Yes, go address those health issues, but don't overdo it and focus on it too much. Keep enjoying sake and sushi and all the good things that are not healthy, just in healthier doses. :)
What is a soapland? Is a place where soaps are made?! hahaha
Please do make A Christmas Carol. I truly believe there cannot be enough remakes or additions to the Christmas/holiday movie archive, I watch and enjoy all of them!! The more the merrier!
"Yes please, do it again, in my mouth" - Chris 2022
lol dam Dave, first you lock up TheRealchrisBroad in some closet with some pizza sand and now you tie up Connor in the trunk of your car... who's next?!?!?!
Old people need to lose their right to vote/hold office just as someone too young can't vote/hold office. Change my mind (you won't)
Ok no joke the food thing I was SO worried about when I first went to Japan cause I genuinely cannot eat a lot and didn’t want to come off rude.. So much so that I actually made myself throw up from over eating lol Will never be doing that again… I’d rather come off rude 😅😂
Oh wow getting trained by the blue eyed samurai himself!
I thought those boxes wernt even a thing anymore. People realised they a scam and you can buy contents you actually want much cheaper.. Was great for just t-shirts lol.
A Chris Broad Carol sounds amazing. I don't know why, but I assume you'd be the Scrooge, and Natsuki being the Spirit of Christmas present. Perhaps Trash Taste or Ian as the poor worker family?  Definitely use any excuse you can find for this one.
This man reminds me so much of Julian Lennon
some interesting content but too laddish to watch.
Say goodbye to tourists money
I love this video, its kinda rare to see people on youtube being transparent as chris is. Most people try to uphold a image or a persona while chris doesnt in his QaA and i really appreciate that.
I hate the term "influencer" as well. I much prefer "tortured artist", especially given the YouTube algorithm. 🙂
Heyo seen u around for a long time finally subbed congrats on 10 years
Concerning the absence of foreigners... I'd wager that foreigners already in Japan are most happy about that, because they now can visit all the places that are usually infested with insta-foreigners and also get and stay there rather cheaply. And with companies having increasingly liberal telework rules, they just pack their work laptop and ride the train to where the want.
Actually the thumbnails on the Okinawa Videos prevented me from watching them. You don't go to Okinawa for the resorts. If you want to experience Okinawa, you do it like you approached Naicha (mainland Japan)... you get a rentacar, stay at minshukus and go to all the places yourself.
This overreliance on superlatives is not something exclusive to Japan. That weird ex-colony across the atlantic is even worse. Anything below the best is equal to a fail... no nuance.
I used to live in Churchill Manitoba ,polar bear capital of the world, is the nickname of the town. My dad used to carry a shotgun with polar bear shells to protect all of us 10 kids while berry picking.  Now there is bear mace but back then a gun was the only option.
Love this episode. Thanks!
I still think the best suggestion to any "I want to be a youtuber/streamer" is, turn it into a hobby, it doesn't become a job until you're actually successful and capable of living off of it, which can take months if you're extremely extraordinarily lucky, or very very likely years.  At this point it's like asking how do I become a hollywood star actor/actress...you work your way up, but never expect it as a given.
...the subscription box was a cool idea until I heard it was a subscription box.  I get it, recurring customers are nice, and a subscription sort of locks that in(in a lazy easy way), but makes it a pain(likely purposefully) to cancel after the first box.  I'd love it, even if there was a tiny up charge if there was a one time purchase button, or subscriptions got x amount discount over time.
What are your philosophical beliefs?
How are all these celebrities going to Japan if they're not letting anyone in? Do far I've seen yungblud halsey and billie ellish post on IG that they're in japab
Is there going to be a fourth journey across Japan 2022 video? Or was this just a three  video series? Been really enjoying this one hope there’s more to come
Really love Chris' videos. The quality is always sublime.
Giving a like for the workout montage, thats inspiration!
Journey across japan episode 3 when ???
it's always funny watching inexperienced people throw punches hahahaha keep up the good work, entertaining as always.
Your shot of Sharla is just pure evil. 😂
That 80's montage was to the beat, sooo... it was too good to be from the 80's. :D
To be fair, Japan in a Pan could be a great take on that idea you had. Going around Japan and learning what it takes to creative these beautiful cultural dishes
Japanese people except those in the tourism industry don't care about foreign tourists. The majority of foreign tourists come to Japan are from neighboring countries and the impression Japanese people have of them is actually bad because of the recent situations. I think business travel should be easier but Japan's majority is the elderly and this country is run by them.
I would love to see the Christmas special 😂😂 please do it
I think that you should try so new things and take us on your adventures.Maybe you could go to the park and take dance lessons from the rockabilly dance Club. Can you fix your hair to look like Elvis Presley? I think that would be so hilarious.
The training montage made me so happy to see you doing
Keep up the hard work Chris and one day you will be one punch man!
PLEASE CREATE ABROAD IN JAPAN'S OWN "A CHRISTMAS CAROL" POR FAVOR THAT'D BE BEAUTIFUL XD
i think you should make an auxiliary channel for maybe 30% of the 60% of videos you throw away
PLEASE LIKE IF ...YOU...like me, want abroad in a Christmas Carol? My thinking is... - past = sharla - present = natsuki - future = ryotoro Then have the cratchits as the trash talk team plus akidearest and you're flying!!!  Connor would be a HILARIOUS fezziwig
hi bro🇯🇵
I know the answer without watching the video: "Because they can"
No other YouTube channel comes close to the production values and cinematography that I have seen. Here's to another successful decade for you, Chris.
For one of the healthiest nations on earth, it's amazing that the country remains shut
That was some dammm fine advice about becoming a YouTuber!
Is the coach in the montage Nicholas Pettas?
That sneak peak of Christmas Carol looks glorious!!!!
A mediocre YouTuber????? Was that person blind or something? You've mastered cinematography like a pro! Anyone saying otherwise is just lying to themselves.
Please! I'd love Abroad in Japan: A Christmas Carol
they are smart
From Spain, my heartfelt condolences for the passing of Her Majesty Elizabeth II, to all the British people. She won´t be forgotten.
DOOO ITTTT! YES
Do it again, in my mouth. 👀
09:30 "Do it again, in my mouth"
Abroad in a pan would be awesome! Maybe on your other channel? Making recipes with friends would be a great video
Best of luck on the journey to self-improvement, Chris. What you need more than physical exercise is 18/6, KETO, OMAD and skipping carbs like rice. You find that part at Youtube - Dr Eric Berg, Dr Ekberg, Thomas De Lauer and Andrew Huberman
Started laughing at the “NO WE ARE PLANNED TO EAT SALMON TODAY” bit 🤣🤣🤣
Super pumped for your training arc! Your determination encourages me even more to maintain a healthy and active lifestyle. It's a painful process but the feeling of accomplishment is definitely worth it. Rooting for you and wishing you all the best. You got this!
its better to come to Japan right now!! you can do everything at suprisingly affordable price!!!
love how your boxing coach just smacks you around 😂
I am so happy that foreigners are not allowed back here in Japan. The tourist industry is just a disgrace bringing chaos and destruction everywhere. I hope it stays this way for as long as possible. Kyoto was a nightmare before the shutdown. Life is so much better now
It's hard to tell if you're making it funny or actually have 0 hand eye coordination. Thanks for the vids though enjoy them alot.
How do the Japanese view death?
Dang it!  I was planning to visit in a few months.  Oh well, I'll find another country to visit.
Japan is the most affluent Third-World country on Earth…
Christmas Carol! Do it!!!
Love you're videos man keep it up.
Happy to see you getting your fitness back. Keep it up Chris!
seriously the Japanese culture is so fake and terrible...
And here I thought it was just because Japan is an extremely insular and racist society who views gaijin (especially Westerners) as inferior races. Oh wait, they do...
Ha! When you were walking in that abandoned town via the drone shot, as soon as I said, "Wow that looks like that pic everyone has seen from TLOU", you mentioned the game (plus played a touch of game music). I had to chuckle!!
Cdawgva says Only boomers watch abroad in Japan
Boxing?!?!  So happy for you!!!  At the same time . . . I’ve been there.  It’s a world of pain.  Seriously though, so glad you’re focusing on your health.  You have millions of people rooting for you . . . Literally.  😳
'Please yes do it again in my mouth' is not a phrase I thought I would hear when I clicked on this video.
GOOD JOB GETTING FIT CHRIS! Honestly I've backslidden a bit and am thinking about taking up Aikido. When I was in college I was a second brown in Tae Kwon Do. 3 times a week... I ate whatever I wanted and was always skin and bones. I think boxing and martial arts are great ways to get in shape!
First time i went to fancy sushi here in japan the chef asked my date if i didn't liked the food because i was so quiet and were just eating/talking with my date. I probably mentioned to him that the food was good but i couldn't speak japanese back then and didn't know about this "rule" either so the chef thought i didn't liked it.
Japan should take a note from Food Wars (Shokugeki No Souma) and open food environments to healthy debate.
RIP the queen
Wow you guys say superlative completely different than in America
That's a really big box of sake that you're drinking!!! Mmmmm 😋
I thought this was scooby doo for a sec…
9:51 video is :Why i dont watch japanese tv:
Saw a sign in a hotel in Santa Barbara saying.  INFLUENCERS WILL BE CHARGED TRIPLE.
Rest in peace Queen Elizabeth II
Please record another song with Naksuki & Joey! Too Much Volcano was epic!
Hey Chris!! Love your videos and hope that I can come back to Japan. I managed to travel there in 2019 Sept....Can't beleive it's been three years. Thanks again for your content as usual and fingers crossed :D
I'm really glad to see your level of awareness on how you feel about your health and current goals. I greatly look forward to seeing how your new focus on physical and mental wellbeing is shown here on the channel and the results you will get from it.  Also do the Christmas Carol thing. Sounds hillarious
Hey Japanese! Hey Foreigner!
No Joke, I was waiting for your Journey Across Japan episodes to come out and never saw the title and assumed you didn't release them yet for some reason. I saw the clickbait type vids and honestly I avoid ones that are like "Look at me I spent a lot of money, give me attention". I was thinking you were trying something different and just splashing out for once, which is well deserved in my opinion because I love your content, so I was waiting for the Journey across Japan vids and then I would watch the clickbait ones another time 😅. Guess I've got a few vids to watch now 😊. Great content as always Chris. Keep up the good work. I'm traveling to Japan in Mid October with a Tour group so I'm really excited to finally experience Japan for myself instead of through your vids. Take Care.
There should be some talk of economics as well. Foreign tourism does not account for much of the Japanese economy. Some, but not much. They are an industrial country with a strong domestic tourism industry (even stronger over the past 2 years). Countries that have a heavy dependency on foreign tourism have opened already. Places like Japan, Korea, and Taiwan can "afford" it. It sucks for the people in the tourism industry in those places, but much of this is just economics.  I have been there many times and have colleagues there. I'd love to go back especially with the Yen at 144 to $1, but it is what it is.
Please accept my condolences on the loss of your Queen.
I actually noticed that you have gained some muscles after watching your latest videos. Keep up the good work!
Finally! someone who also hates the word "influencer". My brother in Christ!
<3
Have you ever thought about doing an episode entirely in Japanese?
I was lucky enough to spend a month in Akita this summer as a Canadian. So grateful. Also the alcohol is way cheaper than in Ontario, a treat.
You should talk to someone like To Toshiki Yamamoto i think that would be awesome tbh
Great job on starting your fitness journey!  MMA style training is the hardest training you will ever do because it works you in so many ways.  If you can do that, you can do anything.
did anyone else feel some serious Rhythm Heaven energy from the training montage? that was dope
Awesome seeing you train man! but for the love of god I'd highly advise you stop doing russian twists and any form of exercise that involves repeatedly curving you spine like that (sitp-ups ect). They are archaic and outdated, but for some reason still widely peddled. and a very good way to speed-run disc degradation any%.  Better core alternative would be mountain climbers :)
We love you capable Chris!
Wanted to come by  and give my condolences on the Queen passing today.
I take it you've heard the news? (UK news).
🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼😍😍😍😍😍👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼🇬🇧🏳️‍🌈🇺🇦
Sick montage at the end lol
Just give it some time...years/decades 🤔 With their declining population, tanking economy, and abysmal introverted social skills, they will be begging people to come soon...
Japanese is talented in Tech, but stupid in decisions.  the dollar is now 144Yen. Disaster for japan, because of stupid laws. Like Bangladesh during the covid growth was 5% and more, because the manufacturing never stopped, when the whole world in the minus. India was -25% growth. by % Bangladeshi covid death lesser than Japan, India, USA or Europe.
I absolutely love your drone shots! I always look forward to them ^-^. Good luck with your fitness goals!!!
Happy 10 years Chris! Although I don't see your videos in such frequency as before, I'm glad to see that you still create great content and hopefully you will continue! Love your honest and humble approach about Japan and when I say this, I'm referring to the "real Japan" and not "Anime Japan". Learn a lot about the counrtry thanks to you and always taking notes so one day I can go there to fulfill my dream and have a great adventure (hopefully)
It might be that living in Japan Chris that makes people from the UK more self conscious, but you honestly look amazing and I hope you reach your health goals to have some peace of mind at least.
I had a flight booked right when the virus hit. Then waited. I was looking to buy a home outside of Tokyo in the countryside. Not one of those abaandoned home but an established nice sized home of around 3000 to 4000 sq ft.  BUT now...
I absolutely love the shots you do in your videos and documentaries. I've recently found myself looking more deeply into shows and videos not only for the cinematography but also the way it is shot and produced. I try to take hints or notes from that since i am just getting back into the swing of things now that i have a new computer and can't wait to edit my videos because it give me practice but also so i can make them look as good as i want them to look and have other people appreciate the hard work i put into the look and editing of my videos. 🙂
FML! I’ve never noticed before, but after you said it, it’s a truth that can’t be escaped… they are so positive 😭😭😭 すごいいいいいいい。。。おいしいいいいいいい
Lately I had been getting excited about the thought of being able to go to Japan in 2-3 years since I figured that would be enough time, but it's really sad to hear that Japan just wants to close itself off from the rest of the world, everyone who lives in Japan is just rubbing it in how "perfect" life is there and its making me angry that I can't be there. I've never really had the chance to do many of the things I wanted to so I hope you're right about Japan reopening sooner rather than later.
Probably bc of pandemic and some other countries not taking it serious. Even with tourists banned, they’re still not managing it easily there
It’s okay for Japan not open now. That means more time to make more U.S. dollars to exchange for Yen.
how that ban , has shu no saw shibuya , harayuko and even on weekends nights ?  bunch of gaijins x.x
Gigantic Hokkaido bears,.. Meanwhile, me living in Canda - gigantic, hmm really?
Rocky Balboa's lesser known twin has a dojo in Japan? Rad!
09:25 "yes please, do it again, in my mouth."
Super clickbait
i never thought a country's COVID policy could be nearly as bad as china's, but japan is giving china a run for its money.
I think you’re a sexy and brilliant man of adventure. Don’t listen to the haters.   All the countries need to drop these insane lockdowns.
not only that i put a budget of like 6000 euros for a month .... and ofcrouse most nice tours are 5000 USD..............  AND its only for 12 days ???????? so i am gone w8...
Considering that Japan is currently #3 in all of Asia for C19 infections proves every single scheme they've come up with to "stop" the spread of the virus has failed so why not just reopen the country and be done with it?
So... You aren't returning to that beautiful hotel where you went last year with connor?
"Don't become a Youtuber unless you're a raging narcissist."
11:50 "Nobody appreciates these things." We do, Chris. Otherwise we wouldn't be here. I think all of us realize that your production quality and editing skills are far more than those of an "average youtuber". 12:25 As far as "click-baity" titles go, we understand what the Youtube game is like, and we don't mind a flashy title. Your titles actually reflect the content you're putting out. They're not deceptive at all. I just wanted to say how genuinely happy I am to see you putting more focus into your physical and mental health, and I hope that this journey will be as successful as your recent achievements.  Cheers from Saudi Arabia.
Chris, not sure if you have ever considered a calisthenics-based program, but it's changed my life. Almost 40 and am truly in the best shape of my life. Combined with a very specific eating schedule and method that leans into only avoiding one food type (dairy) and have managed to reverse a lot of health issues including asthma and most environmental allergies to ZERO. The asthma in particular is completely gone. I have some sources for you (ironically on youtube) that are a good start for research. But hey man, do what works for you! I enjoy the content, keep it up! Cheers.
Finally, more content
This is your best haircut ever!!
I would genuinely love to see Abroad in Japan’s Christmas carol.
I only have one qualm, i came to watch at the very least ONE of your videos that i had not seen before. Lo and and behold i've watched it all. I know you have allot on your plate so i'll keep my request simple. DO MORE!
I think it is so damn positive the fact that you showed your opinion and the facts currently happening about tourism in Japan. Even though big companies are rasing their voices about the needed total reopening it seems that this is useless for the goverment to move forward but anyways the more voices, the better. Thanks for this! :D
Greetings! I have watched many of your videos. You are an outstanding and entertaining teacher on Japanese travel and culture. All very fun to watch. But, at some point can you please make a video on the Naki Sumo Crying Baby Festival. It’s sounds so fun and odd! Right up you and Natsukis alley! Keep it up. You have done well grasshopper.
I haven't found anything to be clickbaity on this channel because its 10000% honest. There is no deception, its hyping incredible Japanese experiences
12:28 I think either Linus Tech Tips or MKBHD mentioned that the surprised faces on the thumbnail generate views not because they do by themselves, but because the algorithm is hard-wired to prioritise videos with faces on thumbnails
How does japan like foreign foods. I imagine its a country of foodies.
I dont like forced friendliness. On the hard contrast, where i live we have a saying "ned gmotzt isch gnug globt" what translates to "not complained is enough praised". Means we complain about everything, but if you manage to elicit praise from someone, oh boy! this will brighten your day. And since everyone wants to be praised, we got kinda known for our perfectionism.
Please make The Christmas Carol!  I legitimately want to see your take on it!!!  I think you should definitely dedicate November to producing The Christmas Carol!!!  Please!!!
Super Latives?
sake is nasty
YES! How do I gently, yet FIRMLY, get you in that direction?
Lived in Northern Japan 1999-2008 Hirosaki. Just a managed to go back for a three week holiday (on spouse visa), the only way back at  the time. My God. Why did I come back to the UK? Being back in Northern Japan was heaven.  Madness. Tories have run this place into the ground. Just discovered channel as I am missing Japan and was searching content. Great stuff. Very balanced. Never come back here. Never.
That's because Japan is smart.  Since allowing tourist back here, lots of people sick with mysterious illnesses.  I know what is happening, so does Japan.
Yes please, do it again in my mouth?? 🤣🤣🤣 are you sure you were watching a documentary?
Well the LDP has also brought inflation to Japan with very few people getting   pay increases...
Make a Christmas Carol abroad in japan edition with joey as the ghost of christmas past, Natsuke as the ghost of Christmas yet to come, and maybe Connor as ghost of Christmas present. But you have to have ryotaro as scruge
I think your thumbnails are nice.
9:15 but if chefs can't ever get genuine feedback how do they improve? Sure, after a while when people stopped coming in and you went bankrupt you must realise that all their sugois and oishis have not been their honest feeling about your craft, but by that point it is both too late and you have no input on what the issue is. Do people now like the ambience in your restaurant? Do people dislike that exotic spice you love using? Are the servings too small? Do they rely solely on online reviews maybe?
Japan knows well about being isolated from the rest of the world. That's what they like to have.
I haven't seen your videos in a while.. who's Connor and what happened to Ryotaro? are you two still friends or have you parted ways?
If the content is good enough you dont need clickbait!
That montage was the cherry on top of this video! Amazing!
Once I get a decent salary here in japan I want to loos my Mt. Fuji stomach too. Right now I can’t afford the gym.
WOW your background is AMAZING😃
Yeah I didn't even realise that the newest journey across Japan was out for a few eps I just thought they were click baity other vids but I get why you have to do it. Damn algorithms
Chris, sorry for being straight forward, Japan would have accepted you back as a foreigner/resident, only if you were vaccinated at the time you left the country. Japan is/was also applying this discriminatory rule where only nationals can travel without being vaccinated like the US or Canada. Lots of love man from one of your viewers who is also trying to lose weight
Y'know I don't click on your videos because of the shit tiles, I click on em because I wanna see Japan. There's a few different channels I watch that show off different aspects of Japan and there countries, so, haha don't be upset about having to do the weird video tiles. Just keep showing off stuff, or I'll call Gordon Ramsey to come in and judge you. 😈
Hokkaido ski industry is getting smashed.
Somebody need to cut "Please do it again! In my mouth!" For use without context!!  9:27
Just the headline I gotta say everyone was doing that  at the time
9:27 🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨
"do it again, in my mouth" lol
The mount fuji comment at the start killed me lmfao
@Abroad in Japan.... when you were talking about your health, I hope you can get it under control because when you get older like myself it's way more difficult
Using Covid as an excuse belongs back in 2020. The fact is,  Japan is currently experiencing 4x the rate of Covid infections than the US is. The tourism Ban is being kept in place partly to reenforce the narrative that Covid is carried and transmitted by foreigners. The idea of intrinsic community spread is too unpopular with the older voting bloc for the government to make effective policy with. And uhm... Xenophobia too, but it's not PC to point that out.
unBEARable 🐻
Honestly, telling young people to get drunk is not a bad strategy to increase the fertility rate.
22:00 Rare Chris moment without memes and sarcasm. I love this answer. Fk influencers, hone the craft
Also....proud you are taking care of you know😁
I'd watch no matter the pic or thumbnail, you are real and sarcastically funny😁💜 pretty great!
Not sure how fit you can get if your trainer has a Mt Fuji, himself...
World’s Grumpiest YouTuber loves Christmas. PLEASE do your version of A Christmas Carol. Be the hero the internet needs.
Based Japan. God bless them for having common sense and not damning themselves to destruction like the west has done. May Yukio Mashima live on forever.
I hope the restrictions will go away. They don't make any sense at all as the virus has already moved through and almost everyone probably has a healthy immunity! Society all over the world needs to live with current developments rather than constantly living in fear! Japan is a lovely place and deserves again to have tourists marveling at its wonders.
日本国籍なら自由に動きます。まだ帰化しませんか。
SUGOI!
I love you Chris  Your such a funny guy  Maybe I should visit the UK 🇬🇧
I'm very aware that the tourists aren't yet allowed to come visit Japan at least on tours that I would like to go to. Cuz I have been trying to get there since 2020... And it really sounds like Japan's going backwards to the 17 1800s when foreigners were not allowed to touch their soil.
Japan is closed  But famous YouTuber Pewdiepie just moved there recently  Care to explain
I'm soooo MAD!!! How dare you do an eighties fitness montage without wearing the eighties fitness clothes!!! I DEMAND a redo with you in some leg warmers, a sweat headband and either the leotard up the butt or some shorty shorts!!!!
8:54  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 This is why I don’t think I could live In Japan 🇯🇵
You should make a second channel to be able to express the ideas you would normally not pursue bc of youtube. I bet a bunch of people would support it.
Brainwashed people
I live in a tourist town. It is nice not to have the typical experience, but the economy now sucks. If people just mailed a check instead of showing up it would be kind of nice. While you are kind of cute, thank you for not doing the montage in 80s skin tight leotards with a smile that rivals Ceasar Romero as the Joker. Those videos creep me out. Nobody should be smiling like that while exercising. Having to flatter someone like that feels inhumane to someone like me. I said thank you and like it. Unless it's a dog or a cat I don't want to go on about it. Maybe a nice guitar, but not in the same manner. If you like pepper, I have pepper, I'll give you some pepper. At the very least I'll get an extra thank you when I give it to you. Maybe even something nice like, "This is better than the kind I buy pre-made."
Caution with full sit-ups - people can overdo it and endanger the back. Slow crunches are better! Glad you're going on this health journey!
Connor is indeed gorgeous and breathtaking, and I'm glad you've finally realised it too. :p
Concerning the video ideas not good for youtube: Your channel is full of videos like "most expensive *insert thing* in Japan". Don't get me wrong I enjoy watching those videos. But what I'd also love to see is videos about what it's like to visit Japan on a budget. This way I could imagine what it would be like if I visited some of the places you are showing. But yeah maybe those videos wouldn't do as well as those extravagant ones.
13:57 Viewer: "What is a soap land?"  Chris:"Ehmm... It's a...place where they make soap!"  Yakuza fans: 😅
I get being authentic but are those square wooden cups really worth using?
Politics? or racism?
Happy 10 years! 🎉 Been enjoying your saucy comment section for about 5 of them. 🌶🥳✨
My boy finally got a fade 👌🏻 looks good
I just got my 健康診断 aswell, I'm turning 40 this year and my cholesterol and bodyfat % are not in good ranges.  So much like you- it's time for me to start focusing on my mental and physical health. :)  頑張りましょう！
what is it about white people... they don't want you there. Stop fetishizing their culture and just leave them alone jfc
Sugoi is the American awesome. Brits reserve awesome for the second coming with Jesus stepping out of a UFO - exceptional and rare events.  Get a grip, America!
The funny thing is by American standards, Chris is rather in shape lol
ABROAD IN A PAN YES
i think we need to make it a competition to see who can insult chris in the most interesting way
I like your content! It's informative yet humorous. Gives a really good picture of what life is like in Japan as a foreigner. Keep on keeping on being the sarcastic being you are!
Good on ya for trying to better ya self son.
I'm super inspired by your workout Chris! I wish you the greatest of success, and know that I will be working out as well!
So the Japanese government is encouraging their young people to drink more and currently I'm watching a CNN news clip saying that the non-alcoholic establishments actually have a higher increase in profis because their young people don't want to drink alcohol as much, but yet they still don't want foreigners to come back and foreigners drink 10 times more.......  Wouldn't that solve the current problem they're having?? 🤷🏾‍♀️ what's wrong with these people?? 😳🤦🏾‍♀️
13:58 those in the know, yeah
Love the montage at the end. Keep it up :)
If japan wants their GDP to go up from alcohol...They should just let me in...i'd single handedly make it 10%.
Good. Now the same has to be done here in the states, ban the japanese after 2 years, problem solved.
Love your videos! Pleasezzz mention my comment in a video. You are witty, funny and extremely talented in the content you create. Thank you. Also make the Christmas Carol please!
ALGORITHIMS
I need abroad in a pan!!!!!!!
To be fair, most Youtube music reactors miraculously love every single song they've ever reviewed.
Japan adopts a strict isolationist policy, to the country's detriment. Yet again. Have the Japanese learnt nothing? Businesses closing, the Yen crashing, economy in a steep nose dive. Same old same old eh?
how are you spelling superlaytives?
I hope the gov understand that if young people drink a lot then they're going to be paying a lot in treatment of liver related issues. :/
imagine if the uk decided to stop any foreigners from coming into the country, it would be an outrage, but nobody blows their top when japan does it?
Can someone please share timestamp for the answer to the titular question of the video. Thanks.
'Cause they are stupid racists. Simply
The Japanese Government has announced an end to the tourist ban this month.
I live in Germany, my last vaccination was over 10 years ago, I go shopping every day, expect on sundays and in the last 3 months the gov. supports a Ticket that was useable in Trains alls over Germany for 8 Euro - a lot of people use it for a summer holliday, it was not useable in high speed trains.
My mum was a nurse for many, many years. She mostly worked in retirement homes. So for her, being on the toilet is more of a social activity. Most people who walk in on you on the toilet, will immediately avert their eyes and leave as fast as they possibly can while not looking at anything at all. My mum will stick around for a chat. I need to know where I can get one of those signs to give to her as a hostess gift next time we stop by her house for dinner.
Training for the next Creator Clash eh, Chris? 😉 It is lovely to see your buddy from Fast Food Japan as your trainer! Would love to see more Nick features on here, he has such a spitfire personality that would mesh well with your format 😁
I watch you a lot actually & you have taught me a lot. I will keep watching & supporting you and wish you always the best. Dig deeper and go ALL IN on the biking and anything you do, way to go bro, keep bringing awesome shit and helping people.
I am going to buy from that sake place you were promoting tho, for real just gonna save up cause I live in America 😂
Clearly we need to send Matthew Perry to Japan again
Congratulations on the 10 year anniversary
Hi New subscriber - Your channel is both very interesting and funny. Has any one said you look a lot alike Terry Jones of Monty Python fame. I went to Japan several years ago on vacation and was amazed at how uniform the society is. How tolerant is Japan is of different religions and relationships (LGBQT)?
I love your personality! :)
Are masu boxes supposed to be drunk directly out of?  Seems like a great way to make a giant mess.  I thought they were just to contain overflow.
Congrats on completing the cyclothon with Connor, and good luck on the rest of your 4 month plan to get your fitness where you want it at! I'm in the midst of a reform myself, so I've taken what you've done recently as an additional motivator for what I've got to do for my own fitness. Wishing the best for your goals, and thanks for the years of entertainment so far (and the motivation). At least I appreciate the cinematography in your vids.
if you do a Christmas carol, please do it with a twist, like add Dr jelly and KFC
I pop in here and there but have a legit question. Is your accent going away??
the shots of hokkaido are some of my faves. i am hopeful to one day spend some time in hokkaido - i live in northern michigan and its fairly similar in weather,.
Do it Chris! Make the Christmas video!
The Muppets version is the best version. I can see you are a person of fine taste.
I wish for you and Pewdiepie to collab
So i wasted all my time learnin japanese i gues i will start learning chinese then
Drink more alcohol but close the bars at 8 pm? Lol oxymoronic much? Thank god SOE is a thing of the past
this is why japan has a low population rate
Thanks!
Well.. now I like the idea of "Abroad in Japan A Christmas Carol"
can you do a video with Nicholas Pettas, its a k1 legend, would love it, like your videos, my favorite are the video with ken watanabe! keep up the good work, enjoy it!
Been watching loads of your videos & subscribed. One thing, on your channels before a vid there’s usually an advert for YouTube premium, it asks if I want to “vibe to the latest bangers”.  I really don’t. Thank you from Manchester
Glad to know that you hate your titles and thumbnails! I too wish you could do something more classic and to your taste.
Those bad comments don't make any sense 😅
I just wonder how long you plan on living in Japan - for the rest of your life?
What is the room you’re staying in for this video? Is that your apartment? It’s feeling very cyberpunkish and cool.
Unbearable 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Thanks!
Yes we need Abroad in Japan a Christmas Carol. It will be epic.🎄🦌🎅⛄
0:25 oh c'mon. He actually loves this  Confiscating the Van Gang's van for YouTube is a great wink  Unfortunately I only got to see this today, not much time besides work, sleep and 10h of wet dogs and Mr. Calfable's buttcheeks
You've got yourself an extra "like" on the very second you made the "unbearable" pun
Youtuber fight vs Shibatar
Because no foreigner want to live there, its no loss for Japanese people😱
When Chris was talking about "Christmas Carol" I missunderstood it as "Christmas Cow" 6:49, lucky he showed an image which heped clear up my confusion
Ok we need that christmas special Chris
Chris you've genuinely slimmed down a bit! Looking good, keep up the great work!!
How do Japanese people say "They took our jobs!"
Congratulations on 10 years of 'Abroad in Japan'- But I postulate that you have been faking these past 10 years: Natsuki is in real life a paid actor from the RSC with a terrible Japanese accent, Joey is really a trained chimp from Cirque du Soleil (in a poorly fitting wig), and the whole thing has been controlled in the background by a 7ft lizard called Ryotaro. The whole series being shot from within a housing estate in Essex. And don't even get me stated on your fake British accent. You have been rumbled! Omedetō.
If I had the money I would be going to Japan and heavily investing in their businesses right now because I know eventually everything will recover to a certain degree so my investments would be going to the moon.
Look at this guy! He’s run outta ideas!
As a professional videographer/photographer, please carry on doing those amazing shots, they add so much to each video!
We appreciate those shots Chris! I've loved your cinematic takes and camera work for close to 10 years now, and they've gone from good to professionally amazing in that course of time!
Almost like Japan 200 years ago. Hope they dont repeat... other.... history.
You know who drinks a lot? Tourists. Just sayin'
Japan urging young people to drink more alcohol to increase tax revenue is just a ruse.  It seems obvious that the real reason is to stimulate a baby boom to boost the shrinking population problem.
I missed the "Go Fuck Yourself" so much
I really like this channel XD Honestly, you are very funny!
04:33 I can't bear your humor.
The last time Japan was closed to foreginers they only waited 260  years to open it up again (and three warships entering Tokyo Bay). Godd luck with that flights booked.
YES! Do christmas carol please!
I was there in late 2019, before the pandemic, great place to finally visit.  I felt safe wondering there myself in Tokoyo and Kyoto.  Room was cheap, transportation was easy.  Food maybe higher than i thought.  Thing is while it is gret to visit, it was so tight.  Most Americans wouldn't really like the small room and space after a while.  China had a lot of tourists there at teh international airport checkout.
Best of luck on the journey to self-improvement, Chris! I've only just started watching your Abroad in Japan videos, but I've loved each and every one!
Also your videos are making you seem narcissistic /very self focused. Unsubscribing. Hope you get better mate. Big love to you.
If you hate your thumbnails and titles, why not change them to “me rambling with very little effort and relying on my “charisma” “
I can see Chris becoming like super fit.  Boxing kind of suits him.  You go Chris! Rooting for you!
It's because they are racist.  They hate everyone that isn't Japanese.
I want Natsuki Tiny Tim for Christmas!
"Do it again, in my mouth". - Chris Broad
British man finds it hard to be positive. By the way, water is wet.
Are you a fan of George Carlin? IF so, what's your favorite special?
Still in the process of watching but I NEEDED to share that my absolute favorite Christmas movie is the Muppets Christmas Carol and I hope you do make it 😂✌️
Are there many samurais left? If so any random sword fighting going on in the streets?
noob country
So true. I've travelled to Japan 4 times (the last one I was able to buy a SIM!) and travelled across the country. The idea of travelling to Japan in a tour group s horrifying. I'll wait till the end of the year then.
I'm curious to see whether my daughter's obsession with Japan will continue now that her school trip this year was canceled.  Here you have someone who has been studying Japanese for three years and got straight As in her favorite class, only to be smacked in the face by Japanese hyper xenophobia.
I just wanted to say you're an amazing film maker, comedian, and you're killing it with the workout! I enjoyed hearing your explanation and thoughts on how you make these few shots that tells a story. I'm not a film maker but an animator and I still have to learn some film concepts and apply it into my animation, it's a learning process. I have been starting slow into my fitness routine recently to warm up. You are doing amazing, keep it up!
How is your personal trainer so unfit
I am so happy i managed to travel to Japan back in 2019. Especially when i've been so captivated by the country for over half my life. The trip was amazing and possibly the best experience ive had (also given i had a very difficult time before the trip). Would've never have guessed 2019 would be the final summer vacation for people to visit Japan before all this! Really want to visit again sometime in the future, 2 weeks is simply not enough!
I love how you so honestly spoke about health and not being ready for opportunities ahead... many of us feel that way and are working on ourselves too! Thank you Chris!
Do it!
The most affable man??
Now I can never unsee all your surprised-face video thumbnails
Make sure to include some resistance training to retain all the muscle that you're currently holding (and even increase it) during this calorie deficit period. You actually have good genetics, man. 💪  Edit: and eat your fucking protein.
Damn that montage actually made me want to work out again. Thank you for that.
Wanna know something I don’t care about Japan anymore. I come to this channel  because I enjoy your humor and personality. I do also love your videos when you take us on adventures :P
LOL, I literally missed Escape to Paradise because of the clickbaity thumbnails, I'm still to this day sitting here waiting for the series to be released 🤦 damn you algorithm.
CHRISTMAS CAROL!!! CHRISTMAS CAROL!!!
Why YouTube doesn't show me your videos anymore?
Love how you aligned the hit sounds with the music in the training video
Sakoku 2.0 is what it is. Joking aside, hope Japan will really open properly soon or i'll just end up going to Korea again.
Calffable
I think that voter base are fed up tbh, mind you the Japanese minds set  very very different from ours!!!
Futile measures killing the economy 🙄
The Muppets version is the best and very true to Dickens original work!!!PLEASE DO !!!
YOU WILL BE SAVAGED BY BEARS!!!
CONGRATS CHRIS !!!Haters gonna hate hate hate..RISE ABOVE IT!!!
They just don't want to know what love is - especially for non-heterosexual relationships.
"GFY" lolzzzzz
how inconvenient is it 2 drink out of a square ?
I (and i think a lot of peeps too) love Christmastime so i would absolutely advise you to do a Chris(t)mas Carol! Btw. young Chris looked somewhat like Frankie Muniz
"Yes please, do it again, in my mouth" - Aboard in Japan, circa 2022, colorized
You mispronounced superlatives 😊
The bit where you talk about the North Korean-style tours and every moment of your existence being babysat.  Is literally me in two weeks. When I found out the tour was getting more and more sterilized, I was ecstatic and certainly not gradually sinking deeper into depression.
my man chris drinking booze in box lmao
Chris thank you so much for this video. Very honest and true to your brand.
Very twatty titles indeed… and we love them.
I absolutely want an Abroad in Japan Christmas Carrol where The Boys of Trash Taste are the ghosts from each part of the story
I am living in the UK now, and I think in some ways most English people think and act so politely like Japanese; and at times you wouldn’t know their true feelings toward certain things.
6:08 Its probably a JoJo reference!
did you ever think that maybe people would definitely enjoy watching you doing dumb shit like cooking something or going to a park or playing with Tuna? some of your shit ideas might me rly fun 😂
They finally got to you! If you came back to Britain you would look relatively slim and fit. But then Japan wouldn't let you back in...
There can be NO scary photos of Sharla. But! If! You should be able to produce such, a scary photo of the Beauteous Sharla in her resplendence of horror, please make it such as we may gander upon her resplendent horribleness in all its grandeur. You're a lucky divot, you are. Bless you and your endeavors💖!
すごい video, best video I've ever seen in my life. Your greatest work so far x10.
As a student i am very lucky. I am currently spending my year abroad studying in Osaka. Hope Japan opens up soon, though.
Two questions really? The first is, what is your opinion on the possibility of time travel?  It's a frequently reoccurring theme in movies and books but do you think it's possible? The second is, what is your favorite, non poker, trump deck game?
i know damnwell japan wouldnt legalize weed but, just imagine it was legal for a second, would be pretty crazy culture
That you didn't use Montage from Team America for your Montage was really disappointing.
Can we expect even a very brief collab with Pewdiepie?
Unbearable 😜
We need a behind the camera abroad in Japan and a day... similar to what Caddicarus did I really liked how it was shown, the notes, what how POV is etc etc ot could be a series ... I really think that kind of content is very interesting and entertaining that why I really like some of Connor and Akis viendo that depict some behind the camera things
Time to summon the ghost of Mathew Perry…
No one I know wants to go to Japan. Many have told me that as foreigners we're not really welcome. There's lots of lovely places on the planet where I am welcome, so I go where I'm welcome.
do it ! ! :!
I think the 'younger people should drink more' might be cryptically encouraging birth rates, as per the late PM's directives.
what is it in the water in Japan that makes males like you so soy?
I always thought the VA in CDawgVA stood for Veterans Association
I really want to travel to Japan someday, do we know when the ban will be lifted?
So with what you just said about being in public and prasing things. I have a feeling that Gordon Ramsay would not last vevry long out in public.
wtf
Sake is disgusting
absolutely luv'd your Hokkaido and Ikeshima footage ; really good stuff ; also great montage at the end XD get tough chris! =]
I would pay for abroad in Japan christmas carol.
Decent 80s fitness montage. Not enough neon workout wear. SIncerely someone who survived the 80s
inspirational words from Chris broad - "even Connor has value"
Chris your channel is one of my favorites been here for about 4 years now keep it up 👍
It's ok. I spent my 30s getting very drunk and chasing women in Japan. I achieved nothing but the accumulation of health issues.
One thing to take from all the health exams is, Be yourself, If your happy bigger, fucking enjoy it., Life is tooooo fucking short to worry about fitting in with everyone around you or their opinion of what you should be.
The abandoned building would be perfect for GoNorthJapan :D
You punch like a baby petting a cat
5:40 is that a unisex toilet?
I love Japan, but if I have to be babysat to even look around in don't think I can go. I've always wanted the freedom to explore a place I've dreamt of being. Not a good look at all for tourism in general.
I would watch the f out of your cooking channel.
Chris must carol
Meanwhile me: I'd watch that, your cooking show. Also love all your work with Connor, Natsuki or Ryotaro. The interaction between all of you is entertaining. Also I like you being a little chubby, but you need to do whatever makes you happy.
Please do the christmas carol  😁it would be awesome
Well done!  I misheard you though, about your plan to do the "Christmas Cow" at Christmas.  I was slightly disappointed when the poster popped up and I read "A Christmas CAROL"  Then you repeated what you just said, and I still heard "Christmas Cow."  Then I had to post my thoughts here for you to read.
1:03 "stop having it be closed".
Japan Christmas Carol would be so fun
You don't like the word influencer cause you are an old fashion conservative like most of Britt's are!.
Japan is the least diverse developed country in the world and yet everyone loves it and wants to go there. Diversity is a curse and a weakness, not a strength.
Japanese are God damn racists
CHRIS PLEASE DO ABROAD IN A PAN (minus the hous burning bit)! THAT SOUNDS LIKE AN AMAZING IDEA!
すごい！
unBEARable!!!! I found it hilarious 🤣 Edit: to the love/hate regarding tourists..does anyone in the world love tourists? They are a needed evil like mosquitos at least imho
I'm profoundly sad that I can't go back to Japan or Honk Kong. Glad I got to see them in 2011 when things were still free and fun..
12:30 Sadly, the watch time is boss - you need the catchiest titles, images and video...
Congratulations on your ten years. Great to hear that you are working out to be healthy. Yes, I have  to say your video and docs are very interesting and informative. Will continue to watch. Like they say Tube on! I'm heading to Japan in the end of October, fingers crossed that everything works out and that all restrictions are lifted. If not I hope to be working on a plan b.
You took the words right out of my mouth at 3:40 This looks like The Last of Us in real life
After all the finger pointing during the pandemic this is the common sense approach. Yet people think risking lives for tourism is acceptable if you wait long enough just to risk another emergence for an economy boost
5:57 I see what you did there.
Open the country, STOP, letting it be closed.
What more we could ask abou life, meaning, life, death and love than love and live by your passion and you will get what you want. Congratz on a dacade of hard work, as a fat person and a 30 yold (or years old both goes) I can say you might have inspired me to live more and get out to the world.. with a chicken nugget always at hand.
One word,  xenophobia.
Would love to see more of these types of videos once in a while. It doesn't always have to be scenic amazement!
chris VS Fousey make it happen
Nice @sharla
I'd heard Japan was finally open to tourists and was thinking of booking a trip, but had no idea things were still so restrictive.  Thanks for the info and the sake discount!
its mad that its still closed !!!
Simple. Japan is large an older population. That population holds the voting block, prevents progress. Just like everywhere else.
Happy happy happy Island people
You and I look like we have the same body type I don't know what their  called but I like to call them reverse sit ups if you lay on your bed put your ankles and knees together come up with your knees towards your chest and do 20 or 30 a day. do this exercise for 2 weeks and start to see results
A Christmas Carol, please!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Japan should sell sake more widespread to the west. Sake is one of the most delicious alcoholic beverages I know. Please more!
I laughed so hard about the overuse of superlatives & excessive praise!  I'd really be in pain having to act that excited & simply thrilled every time I do anything 😂
Wish the UK would do the same tbh.
OPEN THE COUNTRY UP
It’s not super latives it’s more like supearlatives
Chris, just a note, ive been doing fitness for 10+ years to keep in shape. It took me 6 of those to realize that going crazy in the gym is not the answer to long term well being. The answer is creating a good gym workout and then keeping a good eating culture where you dont over eat. Forget about not allowing your self "good"food, you can eat everything, but you have to cut the overall sizes basically in half. The alternate is becoming a muscle fat guy which is not a solution unless you like that look and joints pain.  Gym training stimulates your hunger as the body thinks needs more energy, thus its easy to over eat, excusing yourself with the practice you do. Dont fall in that hole, you need to care of the food intake.
They want people to make more children to=drink more alcohol.
Actually you were a surprisingly expensive hitman. 🤔
Bro don’t listen to the haters. I was enjoying ur show before my trip to Japan in 2019 and I still enjoy it. U have slimmed down and u look professional and you’re  more in tune with your viewers. I enjoy your videos and humour so just ignore the bs that ppl say and keep doing what you’re doing :)
Where is Admiral Perry when you need him?
Natsuki as the Ghost Of Christmas Present. Ryotaro as the Ghost of the future. Joey as Bob Cratchit.... I really want to see it now. 🤔😂
I'm new here but the "unbearable" did it for me lol.
Yes!! Awesome to see you working out!
Chris, love the show. I will just say this, keto and intermittent fasting do really work and do wonders.
Thailand is fully open now....end of story😃
How is it your trainer is your twin?
I would thumbs-up this video, but your sugarcoated take on Japan's problem with foreigners is insulting.
Dude I love your show! Really scratches the itch for an American unable to tour there anytime soon. As to your focus on health, bro, I thought you were my age: 40. Please take care of yourself and all that
This video was very delicious, incredible and all that other good stuff! :)  GG mate! Another 10 years, here we come!
btw like your advice about being an influencer👍
tbh would do chris & elons lovechild ._.
You surely will be healthier :) Ciayoooo  being in the 40s I can tell you it's literally life begins at 40 for me...  Congrats for the 10th anniversary🎉
I'm sorry.... you WOULD do an Abroad in Japan version of the Christmas Carol?? YES PLEASE!!!
I met Ryotaro in Inujima island today when I was working. He was nice and just like I saw on this channel! Please come to make new videos of Setouchi journey! I’m looking forward to it! 😊 楽しみに待ってま〜す！✨
It's awful, I've wanted to go to Japan for half my life. Now I'm in a position in life where I could easily afford it, I'm not allowed. It is heartbreaking. I refuse to get any injection or wear a bag on my face either.
"Nothing wrong with a little _sakoku_ ." - the _bakufu_ , 1603/2022
Let’s go 2023
Based country
Chris'training videos; "A Broad Back in Japan" or " Broad in Japan"
I been close to 20 years surfing the internet and with that experience comes with the fact that yes there always shit that will make you jealous and feel bad as I am sure Chris even experienced many times, but the idea to go on the internet and type all sorts of bullcrap against someone who makes you feel jealous just to vent it, is about as immature as it gets, its easy to control this feeling by playing RAID LEGEND, thats right! Get into RAID LEGEND right now and you get a 2% off from your next bonus.
As soon as the restrictions are removed (hopefully October) I'll be booking my holiday
Hey Chris that’s awesome you’re looking to change yourself for your personal happiness and welfare. I have felt the same too about wanting to change my life so I can tackle bigger lofty goals in my life. You do you, man. ^_-b
Chris is going to enter to YouTuber boxing sphere soon
xenophobia.  common in monocultures.
So, the older population don't want foreign visitors or immigration, but that same population is getting older and will need assistance soon. The younger people aren't interested in doing those jobs, but there's no one else around to do them. Do these old people think robots will do those jobs? Is there some sort of government plan on how to deal with a growing elderly population and a deficit of carers?   I'd like to visit Japan, but I'm not interested in going somewhere I'm not wanted.
Japan banning foreigners is just returning to tradition.
The Connor skits are always so good 😂😂😂😂 Also I love the shots and the cinematography ideas! Keep it up!
open the country, stop having it be closed
Haha Sharla, that backfired, didn’t it?
The birds always sing in Japan, but you never see any
sorry to say this but the child between Chriss and Elon Musk is really pretty 😳
It is stephen king, not steven
Japanese gov is in serious trouble, the celebrity of the last 2 years is just a smokescreen, to divert attention that the patient is undergoing a serious stroke. But i guess nobody is interested attending a socioeconomic lecture voluntarilly.
Ahahaha Connor doing the Batman voice and that shot.
If we did this we are anti asian and racist. "stop asian hate". If they do it then its totally fine no problems here. YIKES what a world . The lowest IQs in the world control public opinions and judgement .
Happy to see old funny guy alive again!!!!  Tat's my Chris!!!!
Narcissism is a clinical disorder and anyone who suffers from it should live their life trying to change themselves.
TELL THIS MAN TO LIFT SOME DUMBELLS! Cycling burns calories and helps weight loss, sure.  But the man has zero muscle and muscle burns more calories just sitting around and helps you keep the weight off you lost with your cardio.  Cycling only keeps fat off if you never stop cycling and he def doesn't cycle everyday or even every week.
Started watching this channel sporadically as my daughter wants to travel there with me. So the relevance in the title got me watching. Then it became a Q & A session about toilet doors & selfies . I lost interest rather quickly.
combat sport/martial arts is the best way to get in shape imo - exercising while learning a useful skill :D hehe. you should give judo a try ;)  PS: I think your videography skills are amazing, especially for being self taught!
Lol that square cup is pissing me off
YouTube boxing next...?
May you have another ten years of better and better content then retire happily!!!
And the same country lets Japanese people do as they please in any other country and treat foreign residents as aliens or guests. One rule for them and one for the rest of the world.  It is no surprise that their economy has been declining for decades with this and all of its social problems that they shove under a rug.
you look much better.
the hold on tourists is still on ? i had no idea . what about students , my son is at uni to learn Japanese culture and language and is suppose to have a year working in japan schools. do you know whats going on with this?
Japan is just being ridiculous at this point with their border
Japan needs to ban China.  Problem solved!! Japan allows tooooo many chinese to come and go.  Yes, believe it.  Each year the Japan immigration stamps 2.1 MILLION entertainment visa for chinese women from china to work as XXX in Japan.  Of course they bring alot of diseases!!  Not counting all the millions of normal tourists, businessmen, and college students from china.  Yes, I DO know, I used to live in Japan for a year!!
Abroad in Japan's a Christmas Carrol is your dream follow it VIP dabig!
Best part of the video is Connor in the back of a van with a gag.
Ohhh imagine chris broad in the next creator clash
What I like about Chris, is he calls a spade a spade and he never panders to anyone/anything. Here's to 10 more years. Cheers!!!
I'm glad you called it a North Korean tour, that's pretty well exactly what it is and I've called it that as well. I've seen articles dumping on people who have that mindset but it really is, and I'd rather pay that crazy upcharge and actually go to NK rather than to Japan where I've been for 5x less the cost per week
I remember when I said oishi in a restaurant in Japan and the whole crew lit up and said it back and thanked me 😅 Last time I did that, it was mildly busy there too
Hwzit! I'm a South African but wanting to come teach in japan 日本. When do you think government will open the borders tourist's to come through...  Maybe more tourists will increase alcohol consumption....
It sounds like Kyoto have the same problem as Venice in Italy
Chris preparing for the next creator clash
Honestly they will have to grow up as a society soon because with their low birth rates, backwards views on dating, and political influence by previous surviving generations who only have self interest in mind and not the societal betterment of their future.  They will not survive the next century without foreigners and less intensive work environments and focus.
I really hope a lot of people are stopping on clicking on those click bait thumbnail videos. I really hate them lately. And they shouldn't be necessary for channels with a lot of average viewers. YouTube didn't use to be like this, but because of a stupid algorithm it did. To be honest, I skip videos now if they look to click baity even tough it might be a good video.
At 5:18 when his Girlfriend actually puts in a request for the video and it’s hilarious 😂
did...Chris just praise Connor?
I was "lucky" enough to get engaged to my Japanese partner right before the lockdowns. Went back to my country for work and they essentially pulled up the drawbridge and locked the gate behind me. We have just successfully gotten married in Japan despite me not being physically in the country for almost 3 years. Now waiting for approval of my partner visa. Expensive process and a shame we couldn't be in the same country let alone room on the day of my marriage. But even sadder for the separated couples who aren't ready for marriage.
You’ve lost weight! Looking good my friend x
I really really hope you're right and by the end of the year everything is fine to visit Japan. I booked a flight end of 2019 for August 2020 and i got killed by COVID. Now a friend and me are hoping to visit Japan next year in April/May. Let's hope it works out =)
If I wanted to go on a guided tour I'd go to North Korea
I discovered your channel because the YouTube algorithm recommended your Japanese TV shows feature and I've watched everything on this channel since, one of the best things I discovered in the 2020 lockdown era! Cheers to more years
This was a rather strange introduction to your content, you are so reserved! Lolz
Usually people get slimmer when they live in Japan, not Chris
For someone with such a big following, I with you'd bring to light the racism in Japan. IF YOU ARE BLACK DONT GO! YOU WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED ANYWHERE IN JAPAN!!!
I planned on moving to Japan in 2020. But, needless to say, that didn't happen.
I actually literally clapped at the advice on focusing on a skillset first and becoming a YouTuber second, and how the word "influencer" undermines the craft behind it. Great advice
Laughed out loud multiple times, thank you for another great video Chris..
Well Chris you've certainly taught me more about Japan than I could ever hope to learn elsewhere, so I will return a bit of knowledge. When it comes to this Draconian Health Report you have and feeling ultimately pressured into a "healthier lifestyle" - that's a load of nonsense. Of course, you can't be a 500-pound obese alcoholic and expect to live past 40, but you are FAR from that. You're doing just fine as you are. As someone 20 years your senior and marginally concerned with this type of health paranoia, I would advise you to be sure that you "live before you die" - i.e. don't deny your body type or who you are and all the pleasures that life provides. Keep the mind active and healthy, the rest will be just fine...
You know what Chris, I’ll workout along side you, metaphorically speaking. Need to lose some weight myself too.
It's funny that he talks about his thumbnails becoming clickbaity. I found this channel back when "Culture Shock" was the latest upload and the thumbnail was a mural of a naked lady on the side of a building.
Thanks for all the pictures of kiyomizudera, it made me natsukashii remembering the wonderful day I spent wandering around there and Kyoto 13 years ago.
The goal of the NWO is to make everyone very poor. The broker the Japanese Government makes the people, the more brownie points they will get with that Bond villain Klaus Schwab. The policy would only make sense if there was no Covid in Japan. Covid is already in the country. Keeping foreigners out isn’t actually protecting the elderly, it’s just wrecking the future of the youth.
Nice Kyoto lifestyle, hating tourists but apparently not having sufficient industry in order to sustain themselves without them. What a joke.
I've been watching your videos for quite some time. Your videos honestly rock, and you talking about your craft... I wanna say it's definitely noticed. That montage at the end though, won me over. On the same health voyage myself. Let's keep at it!
庭のうぐいすmeans 'a garden nightingale' ;)
Rip my drame of freely going to Japan as a vacation someday
Chris broad plays TLoU. I can die happy now
Because it's not a party if your not intentionally destroying your economy
Your video is very good. I always follow your channel and always support you. Have a good day
congratulations!!!
15:35 — Cycling again 👍
If Japan isolates and breeds( or lack of) itself out of existence ,  so be it. Admiral Perry had to bust open this xenophobic country . Is the world going to need to do this again  ?!
I was right you were going to the gym
I just got back from Japan last month. I want to live there now 😅
i think they're using covid as an excuse. for something the government wanted to do all along.. but they weren't able to do it before covid without being called xenophobic.
You want to loose weigh?  Cut the carbs!  I know, hard to do in Japan.  I went on a 30g carb limit diet to reverse type 2 diabetes and lost 40lbs.  18.1Kg for my metric friends.  I have not felt this good since I was in my late 20s.
Asians are incredibly racist.
Here from the stream lmao
"Self-taught myself," as opposed to "Self-taught you"?
I did it.
Here from the stream
Here from connor’s stream. 😂
I did the funny
I came here and liked the video because Chris told me to.
Just did the deed.
+1
Seeing as you asked so nicely we are here
Coming from livestream. Challenge complete.
I did the thing
Here from the stream :) love you guys! Keep it up
Chris told me to come here and like this.
Came here from Cdawg stream. commenting for exposure

keep cycling
Lfg monke and Affable man
Chris sent me lol
just because u ask gently
chris summon us!!!!!!!!!!!
Chris sent me here from the biking stream, +1 like
yo
I've done my part
DO THE CHRISTMAS CAROL PLS
Funny enough, in recently released video games from Japan I've played; they poke fun at their own conservatives with being so shut in and boxing themselves in.
Pls do Christmas Carol.
I am really hopeing that Japan's border will be open by the end of the year. Planning to attend Evo Japan 2023 in March.
I don’t know when the COVID thing stops being a thing.  China is worse.  I just want to visit an expat mate in Shanghai, as I did I 2019, for a few beers and a mooch.  Ditto Japan.  Over twenty years since last enjoyed Tokyo.  Japan can stick its organised tours up its bottom.  I’m happy to read a map, pick up a few words and phrases, and work the damned thing out on my own terms.
I'm stuck on the thought of drinking booze from a wooden cube. I can't get my head around it, or my mouth.
you pronounced superlatives weirdly
Chris you are so inspiring and answer these questions better than any YouTuber could tbh! Honestly if you could be like the Tony Robinson of Japan that would be badass! Hopefully the BBC would notice you. Otherwise you're great on this platform too! Wish you the best, always.
Quotes that should not be taken out of context: "Please do it again, in my mouth" - Chris from Abroad in Japan.
I will drink all the Japanese alcohol....just let me in!
You have one of the most bittersweet channels ever. Sweet because of all the awesome stuff you show us, but bitter because I have no idea if I will ever see them my self.
So cool to see you training with Nicolas Pettas! Dude's a legend, the last blue-eyed samurai
If 60% 0f your ideas go in the bin, you have a really high acceptance rate. As an inventor I have 90% thrown out because of too small a market.
The Japanese government is on something else if they think that they can survive without tourism.
I made that ABROAD IN A PAN logo meme! Hahaha! I'm so pleased you used it in a video 🍳
You should make a prank video where you give some really really bad things some Japanese people you know to eat. I am really curious what would they say.
@9:24 "yes please, do it again, in my mouth"
Now you are gonna get two thousand questions on philosophy
12:45  more views because it's weird to see happy Chris ;)
Can someone time stamp when he addresses the question posed in the title? I’ll come back and check later didn’t click this for a q &a
So in other words they're also quietly destroying Japan erm sorry preparing the Great Reset.
WHAT THE HECK IS ACTUALLY A SOAPLAND NO ONE EVER ANSWERS THE QUESTION lol
Just cause I know Chris will appreciate this comment and cause I liked it, the sync to the beat at 25:34 was great man
What??? How can someone fit mount fuji in the stomach? I think thats a guiness world record :O congrats chris.
Go for the Christmas thing! We support youuuuuuuu! 🎄❄
I really like your videos. Big fan of your take on Japanese culture and how it meshes (or more often doesn't mesh) with your British-ness. That being said, I've actually started instinctively not clicking on your videos with the super click-bait thumbnails; thinking, "Oh, damn. He's gone down the path of the douchebag youtube celebrity." Cuz I don't give a shit about how much something costs, or whatever cringy stunts idiots do on this platform. However I really like your travel logs, so hearing that those titles with lots of zeros in them are actually part of your Across Japan series was very surprising. It's gonna take effort to get past my gut reaction to not click them, but I realize I'm probably in the minority. But even so, I for one would love to see way less click bait and more you being you and making what you love.
Chris mas Carol sounds perfect
Same as many other countries, demographics in Japan are going down, specifically on the first world of course and its very sad.. Our politicians, far from helping, they even help to "not have any kids pls" with plenty of bad decisions.
Great job Cris. Like always.
What a hell Chris if u going to workout use Rocky music , this one is good to. Happy 10 years of channel!
The resurgence of Evil Chris (Dave?) was a great touch.
I thought this was a broad in Japan lol....
Honestly i respect japan for not going “global”. That shit is just a slipery sloap that sooner or later kills the culture from the country in question. If u like japan’s culture, be glad they still keep their borders up..
Try Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu! Great for health
Sonnō jōi lives on...
I have to share I got blocked by hideki kamiya today lolol im honored
Banning tourists but certainly not banning business or "gov" travel... Gotta love the fucking logic there
Japan, don’t make me send a certain Commodore.
The 1980's fitness montage was pretty rad!
I would not be able to survive in Japan because I am too honest and I can't hide my feelings. I am autistic so I don't know how to lie and hide my feelings and thoughts. Being autistic is like drowning in your emotional breakdowns and feeling like an alien amongst society with textured static tickling your brain and body with invisible fingernails scratching your nervous system with fireworks randomly firing. It's a constant process overload. It's sad that Japan is racist and have no respect for people who are not Japanese. It's a reflection of their dictatorship. Their economy is damaged by their government's abusive habits.
Thank you so much for all the effort and work you put into making your videos and the passion you have in your work. It has been a real, real rough period in my life and it is nice to know I can sit down and watch one of your videos to get a laugh or be able to watch a in general great video so thank you!
I'm on the same page on taking care of my health, 240 being my biggest weight I've decided to bring it down I'm at 210 and not stopping I appreciate you man
if people like me who have lived in Japan for 6 years are still not welcome... well.. I guess I will look for countries other than Japan to move!
I haven't seen calves like that since Joe Pesci got hit in Casino
I really like your videos, but I found it funny when you as a British saying that Japanese tends to say "sugoi" and praising everything. It's true but in the same level as English people esp television/radios do.
Can you make a video of secret places like secret restaurants or bars
What's the currency in Japan Chris. And what's the exchange rate of Japanese Yen to the US Dollar? Why are you using JPY100=USD1? And why do it anyway? Are your viewers all from the US and stupid? I am sorry to come across as a massive twat, which I have, but you live in Japan, not the US, are from the UK, and Japan does not operate in Dollars.
He should ask Grant help with getting the attention of the BBC. I am pretty sure he worked there at one point.
From what video is the shot of Connor from 10:30?
“I’d self taught myself” — Chris Broad, 2022
Good luck with health and fitness Chris! Your hard work shows, I noticed the progress in your appearance before you mentioned what you were doing. Keep it up!
It honestly looks like you’ve made some health progress already! You look much brighter, and i’m happy to see you working towards feeling better. Cannot wait to see the new video’s, keep it up! <3
If you ever get in a fist fight with the affable Chris, don't worry you got this
It's more like open up the land of WANO COUNTRY🤧😂  is this ONEPIECE?🤧
Traditionally very cautious folk… xenophobia is a natural consequence. There are legitimate concerns.. so of course xenophobia means legitimate concerns must be taken to the furthest extreme that is acceptable.
Viewer: Chris, what is a Soapland Chris: tries to make a bullshit excuse what it is hilariously  Me: Just play the Yakuza games, you'll learn what they are  quickly lol
Yes please, for the Abroad in Japan Christmasu Carol.
i shouldnt have looked up what a soapland really is
For someone with a shellfish allergy, how concerned should I be when visiting Japan?  My family is planning a trip for possibly 2023/2024
That’s dumb on commenting about the food. How is someone supposed to get better at cooking if they don’t receive criticism. That’s how we evolve.
This guy is such a weeb
what the fuck? I just saw that I'm somehow not subscribed to Abroad in Japan anymore, and I know that I've never unsubscribed. that happen to anyone else?
8:02 - 'SuperLAYtives'???  Err, suPERlatives, I think Chris!  Come on, you used to be an English teacher.  But thanks for all your very entertaining and informative videos.  Love them.
Open wanos borders
hey man wanted to let you know my subscription was deleted and i just found out
I've noticed your newer videos have little to do with their incluencer-style title and thumbnail. I would do it too if it were my sole source of income, but I wish Journey Across Japan Ep. 2 wasn't called I stayed at a $3,000 hotel OMG!!!
Nice to see Q+A back!
They too harsh on you. You're amazing
"yes please, do it again, in my mouth" - wise words from Chris
Thumbnail and clickbait: I agree with you, people crave that stupidity and youtubers live or die by it. I am Canadian and look at Linus Tech Tips as Linus is the master of the stupid face with 15M subs, yet he keeps doing the stupid face. I just don't get it, but it's a fact.
If I don't see you in the next Youtube boxer match, I'm gonna be very disappointed
Oi Chris! I saw the craziest thing, I think I found your doppelganger. Is it you on the photo @ 21:14 ?
Don’t for get smoke more, the government has their fingers in that industry too.  I’m full on honest 90% percent of he time… my friend must hate me 😂
Cut your sideburns you hippie.
Can't find your video doing the japanese youtuber sketch 🥲🥲 tbh, that segment was hilarious and 100% true, I wanna watch the rest of the video 😂
8:53 HUH Chris 😳
CHRIS!  i have follow your channel for roughly 7 years now, awesome content with good humor.  Buttt... Where the fuck did you get the ramen cup that continuously steams??????????? That is awesome.
Chris, you have said you want to make a small movie before you leave Japan. How about a video continuing on and explaining why Natuski owes 100,000 yen to the man at the beginning of JTJ4?
Yes, Christmas carol throughout Nov
Japan people could learn one thing or two about alcohol consumption from czech people: D.
What you say about always being exaggerated, not knowing what people really think, is why I left Japan. Japan is like the perfect one night stand (in more ways than one), but it's not a relationship for life! I don't know how you've lasted there for 10 years!
Fake title
That workout - just a cheap cgi )
Do the Christmas carol
That ending shot T_T Oh Chris, you look perfectly fine to me.
racism thats it
09:00 why the fuck ask if you can't answer 😂😂
I hereby give you an excuse to produce the christmas-project.
18:40 Let's not fool ourself it's always about politics.
I’m glad your taking your health very seriously Chris. I know the community wants you in this YouTube business in the long run. We are rooting for you and your future endeavors. 🤙
dude you have a smoke machine attached to a ramen prop. That's dedication lol.
Actually the recent thumbnail that you talked about made me not want to click the video cuz it may me think the content of it would have been something I wouldn’t enjoy (ie typical youtuber stuff showing only the luxurious villa and extravagant life whereas i am more interested in travelling videos, scenery, banter with friends).
What life lessons you can extarg from your youtuber career from the 10 years of experience, philosophically and in general about life and everyday
hmm didn't know you'd be the type of person to be intrigued by such topics, I hope you get asked by those questions someday.
Chris, I know you are new to the fitness thing but I don't think your PT is supposed to beat you up..
What a joke, just for taxes they want their youth to drink more.
Great work on all your videos Chris! Fitness aside: If your goal is to slim down, your diet is going to be more important than exercising (unless you're training like an Olympic athlete, basically nobody "burns off" a bad diet). Having said that, it is still really important to do plenty of exercise - both cardio and resistance (because there is more to your health than weight!).
Without a doubt I am waiting for abroad in Japan Christmas carol now
How are you doing with the newer algorithm?
unbearable Pog joke
accommodation. It made my kid sister (15) feel so secure in our lodging.
try climbing (bouldering) it helped me, could do the same for you.
If they want more people to drink. Let us Aussies in
The japanese gouvernment needs alcohol tax money and people? Well, they can kill two birds with one stone: Send headhunters to England and Germany, am i right, mate? And your daughter with Elon Musk? Would smash. Can´t wait for her own YouTube-channel: "A Broad in Japan".
Mate. You can take over Peter Barakan
I studied Japanese for a long time, until graduating last year. I want to visit Japan when everything is safe. I wonder when that would be. Who knows, maybe I'd be able to get there after I got my master's degree, or, if I try it, after my doctorate
Hey Chris, i just wanna let you know, someone told me if you want to lose weight faster its better to focus more on jogging/bicycling, your exercising from 15:50-15:59 is great but there was alot of sit-ups and pull ups which even though that build muscles, it also builds on the body fat making it harder to lose and cut down on weight. I'm no expert but just a good tip. Hope you have good health and best wishes, and don't forget.. ....MAXIMUM EFFORT!!!!!!!
The thing about your thumbnails is your content backs it up, and I can't help but want to watch it because I know its going to be great
kono filthy gaijin!!
The sun is singing, the birds are shining, it's a beautiful day in the neighbourhood. Goodmorning America!
As someone doing Psychology at A level, I can carefully say it is a horrible study. Instead of using a native speaker for it, they used the same Japanese speaker to enable their confirmation bias. Theoretically a larger sample size and an independent groups study where you have in one group various native Japanese people and in the other native English speakers would remove a lot of their issues. I will not get over this so long as it exists.
So does Taiwan, although they are slowly loosening things.
They got the excuse they needed.
Supposed to move there in the spring. Fingers crossed visa applications aren't frozen again.
Nobody care about COVID in Europe basically.....Japan is so stubborn in this
Chris I am just happy that you take the time to cut your nails before you do your videos. Otherwise, great job as always.
YES!!!!!!!!!! Abroad in Japan Christmas Carol sounds A M A Z I N G !!!!!
Amazing how many people spread negativity cause they have nothing else to to
You get a like for pushing yourself hajime no ippo style.  Love it, keep at it!
The internet is so weird! The thing is, personally, based on the titles and thumbnails alone, I NEVER would have clicked on any of your videos. I find it really off-putting.   But I really enjoy your actual videos! ❤ I’m glad my girlfriend introduced me to your channel.
Is possible to go to Japan after three years
Ya because mediocre YouTubers have over 2 million subscribers…😂. Peoples rude comments are Baffling and plagued with stupidity. Your vid’s are the bomb! Keep it up!
I’ve been watching your channel on and off for a few years, so it’s easy to notice the physical progress you’ve made.
Considering the Last Supper is literally just bread and wine, I’m sure that many of our modern meal is in fact better than the Last Supper.
Most Sake should not be drunk out of those wooden cups. Overpowers the subtle flavors.
Yey muppets!
good japanese kitchen
Oh, PLEASE give some philosophical stuff. I'm especially interested in how Japan possibly has changed your views on life stuff relative to western ideologies.
Sarcastic Chris intros are the best!🙌🏻
I think they just opened up again recently.
What are gyms like in Japan compared to anywhere else such as the US, The UK, or Australia?
Lol glad I stayed till the end
Allo !  A positive comment here. Like your vids and humor, thanks mate!  Keep goin and ignore the haters :) Peace
I love muppet christmas carol, I watch it almost every christmas
24:49 Chris training for the next Creator Clash confirmed!! Sugoi~ Omoshiroi!
Biggest cultural difference pointed out by Chris here between Brits and Japanese, Everything is miserable and shitty for Brits and everything is "Sugoii" for Japanese.
Christmas Carol will be the best thing to happen to 2022.
I understand why they are hesitant to reopen. Queensland kept the virus largely out until January 2022. They then opened up due to pressure from business and everybody caught covid and keep on catching it. Those same businesses are now having a massive cry because their staff are constantly off sick. Old people are dying in droves in our nursing homes and there's insufficient staff in nursing homes and all medical facilities cause the workers are constantly catching covid. The shitstorm that hit Europe and USA in 2020 finally arrived here.
I really love that "Go fuck yourself" Natsuki bit 🤣 Keep it up Chris, you are doing amazing work!
Abroad in Japan sparring with viewers challenge let's go!!!!!
you do not loose weight by working out.  You loose weight by eating less.
Abroad in Japan Christmas Carol! DO IT, DO IT, DO IT, DO IT, DO IT!
The studio looks so freaking amazing!
Damn, even Japanese Boomers are like Boomers elsewhere. Catering to old people shouldn't be considered outside of making sure they aren't destitute.
That last shot at the very end is why people love Chris. Never takes himself too seriously.
Here is where the title of this video begins: 16:36
Abroad in a pan, lmao! YESSS!!!
Congrats with 10 years in Japan.  In your Q&A: should i become a Youtuber? Answer should in first place NO, because there are a lot youtubers now. It's really hard to jump good out and reach viewers. If you're not unique or special compared to others, gain viewers will very slow. It's same for Twitch, there are so many channels, it's so hard to come good forward to front. If you start much earlier, 3-5 years, you have better chances than today. If you are just gamer like everyone... i should search for good job. Now it's more harder to be discovered by viewers.  My question for you: are you doing morning exercises? It's part of Japanese culture but also good for your health to keep in move and stretching, burning some calories... It started already at 7.00 in the morning, is that not too early for you?
Oh my god he agreed to be in creator clash when he went to LA
Could you maybe drone into the round school?
We entering Chris Broad tournament arc
pls do a Christmas Carol! Christmas is my favorite holiday too, so seeing that will be be real gem!
New doctrine unlock: Mandatory alcohol consumption for everyone (toddler recommended)
if traveling or tourists is still ban why then that airline seemed surprise or the survey about only a small amount of people came to visit japan....doesn't make any sense
I thought the title was japan banning funerals thought that's why the life expectancy is so high. Would just be impolite really
KSI vs Abroad in Japan. The influencer boxing match we didn't know we needed.
I LOVE your comment videos!!!
Fuck those haters. I love your channel and been watching for 5+ years now. Keep trugging on my man 🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻
Name a more iconic duo: Japan and isolationism
Eating sushi while watching
Japan ban is over!
Sake is great. It's big problem is that, beer exists.
Do it.
I've heard that Japan is one of the worst places to be single. Is this true?
SO TRUE nobody wants a north korea style tour
Lets goooo, get em gain Chris
I hope that I ever get to visit Japan. I hope that you get your fit back
WOW! this video is INCREDIBLE!!! 2x thumbs up!! Very delicious
How about Japan legalize cannabis. The younger people would adopt that more. They can increase the economy by taxing marijuana!
頑張ってください！
Run and maintain a calorie defecit, the weight will fly off!

A Bread in Japan, reviewing Japan's best varieties of delicious bread. Make sure to invite Garnt for this one.
Chris please look up how to say "superlative" 😁
I do wonder if you've ever thought to dub your video's... I really think they'd appeal to the Japanese audience, since I wonder (2nd usage) if they've ever seen their country shown off in the way you've shown it off irl.  Maybe it's already a thing, but just wanted to put it out there.
I feel opposite. Westoners always say Nice! Great! That's good! Fantastic! A LOT. I am kinda tired of being extremely positive to be honest lol. Always need to be ready to say praised words!
I need the Abroad in Japan Christmas Carol.
....I watched this documentary about Okinawa. I think it was set in a poor suburb or something, I doubt the whole country are alcoholic junkies who shun hard work. Almost looks like that's what Japan wants. Or maybe they're hoping the young would get drunk, get pregnant and replenish the work force.
Soy face thumbnails are the youtube meta, you're right that it probably triggers something in our monkey brain
A Muppets Christmas Carol is fantastic!
9:19 Every once in a while Chris seems to channel Stewart Lee for a moment. This is one of those times. 🤣
what is your favorite shooting framerate for regular videos? 24fps vs 25fps vs 30fps vs 50fps vs 60fps
heartbreaking we had four round trips tickets to Tokyo for $200 a piece this February
Bro.. "Crossfit with Abroad in Japan" has a certain ring to it..
Thank you! It was our pleasure to collab with you!
Love your stuff but super lative? lol
Chris was so engrossed in his Q&A that he didn't even notice him finishing his ashtray.
It makes so much sense that JunkFoodJapan is the guy helping you get fit. He's a beast of a dude, and probably the best person to train with 👍
Thank you for speaking well on these topics and about health. Also, I would love to see your take on The Christmas Carol. It would be wonderful.
That was a cool fitness montage~
Wild how my first time in Japan was Jan 2020..
There is no other questions about life, the universe and everything mate... it is 42.... But discussing it is fantastic :D
Chris looks so damn fit!
I've been studying Japanese language, culture, folklore, etc on and off for years now and it's really sad to keep seeing the isolationism. It's not only hurting the country but it also hurts people like me who love most things about it but Japan doesn't want people like me in their country because of politics and/or the elderly population, and culture and them holding onto their strict traditions.
You know, I already had a feeling you were going to the gym or something; it’s starting to show 👍
Okay Chris..... real question then.... do you believe in God? are you spiritual? what does the real Chris Broad think happens when we die? has living in Japan changed any of your religious / spiritual beliefs... (PS i know this is bargepole material... but you asked for it.......)
Congrats on 10 years Chris, I still miss the original jingle from your old vids.. Cheers!
i've been watching for about 7 years, this is one of my favorite videos. Love the honesty!
Constructive criticism isn't rude and giving a much more genuine albeit filtered opinion should be a norm 🤦🏻‍♀️
where the video about snowed aged beef chris ?
What is a reasonable price for a hit, Chris?
Hearing that you actually hate the clickbait titles and thumbnails yourself kind of removed any of my negative feelings about them immediately.
Yes give us abroad in japan christmas carol, it would be amazing
Great way to make hiring a personal trainer tax deductible :D
lmao those bears are so tiny though
That connor shot is amazing(the batman one).
Man from Ur eyes I see the tiredness, I won't conclude what is it from but get over yourself and keep look fatty-happy ;D And STOP doing these bad thii&ii&&ngsss~~~~~
Dam Mr Broad is a badass
Super... latives. weird.
I love chris, my favorite trash taste character !
Absolutely loved the video but i've got to say Chris my grandma trows a better jab than that 😂😂
Chris looking fresher every video! What a chad.
That abandoned city shot where you go up and back to reveal the city is honestly the single best shot I've see on youtube.
You reading comments will always be one of my favorite things you do. Lol the things people say never ceases to amaze me.
Thank you for sharing your thoughts on "influencer". I appreciate your perspective on it.
you've motivated me to try and get some exercise today! Goodluck to you!
I've now got the new so called "beautiful blue" passports so the one in the thumbnail is kinda nostalgic lol
Try keto diet instead of hard training it’s really life changer plus do intermediate fasting
Please make a Chris-mas carol
Wouldn't something like nebula also work for you?
I was very lucky to be able to go to Japan 3 weeks ago to attend my friends' wedding in Tokyo. This is one of the fine print exceptions that will allow you to travel! I also visited the incredible island of Yakushima, which you talked about in a previous video Chris. It was truly incredible.
I really love what you said about being an “influencer” as really it’s about a human love for something that makes you happy and not just about being “online famous” as I’m sure a lot of people hope to be  I think our modern day influencer is just the same as when people wanted to be super models and tv stars, maybe for a love of the art in the industry but many definitely for the clout   As for me I make comics because I love art and storytelling and really just hope people will like them too but I’m okay if they don’t   Excellent advice without discouragement is really the best kind!
you have cinematographic eyes and I really agree with you almost in every opinion of you...even the bitter ones
It was really great to see you training with JunkFoodJapan!
ik ben zo verrast dat je weet het zeker
just like rocky 4  haha
Ask Klaus Schwab if you have the balls to understand what's really going on at the moment.   But surely you are just another Covidian, yes or no?
6:26 ok is it just me or is she actually kinda .... cute. PLEASE. IT CANT BE JUST ME.
ik vind het leuk te breken mijne broeken
hallo ik ben fredrik en ik had een broek. en ik had ze gebrekd
As an Artist I love watching your documentary videos and the cinematic shots because the angles and story telling through visuals. I actually use some of your videos as references when drawing because you use good angles all the time
have you lost weight? Idk why but he somehow looks more skinny to me...
Are there any jobs that require me to drink and impregnate the locals? I’ll take that job 😂
If your Christmas Carol is anything like Blackadder's Christmas Carol, then yes...do it.
yo from watching that last workout segment I see that you actually have some talent for boxing and I've been doing Muay Thai for the past 4 years and its the best thing to ever happen to me, I highly recommend it so make sure to give it a try! I'm heading up to my 57th fight with a record of 49 and 7 hopefully ill be able to win and get the 50th dub! good luck with working out, I hope you stay with it because I feel better than ever for the past 4 years.
I would love to watch you do cooking videos!! And i love the name for the series too haha
a lot of your videos are clickbait as fuck though tbh
The Muppet Christmas Carol is you favorite version??? I had no idea you were such a man of culture.
awesome montage
Hey, Chris. You are an amazing content creator hope everything is going ok. Btw u don't look fat or out of shape at all
It’s crazy to think I’ve been watching your channel and hoping to go on JET for 9 years now. I finally graduate university this year and am hoping to be able to go on JET next year. Appreciate all the work you’ve put in this past decade Chris :)
Yes, please do Abroad in Japan Christmas Carol!
Japan, open the country so that I can come and drink all your sake plz.
Yes yes yes to the Xmas carol!  Natsuki as the ghost of Xmas present, sat on his stool, belly laughing with a half drunk bottle of sake!  Yes please make this happen 🤣🙏
There's about a hundred other *HEALTHIER* ways to "boost the economy", but I guess your government always has your best interest in mind, wherever you live... 🙄
Someone needs to tell Chris how to pronounce ‘superlative’ 🙈
Chris im back in Japan hopefully at the end of the year, I've got the BIGGEST abandoned map of Japan. I'll trade you locations for sake!
knock me out.
What’s a Super Lative, Chris? 😂
Corona hit right when I was about to do a trip to Japan, South Korea and Hong Kong. I'm departing in about a week for South Korea so hopefully in the month I'm there I'll be able to do a side trip to Japan if they remove the guided tours.
Hey Chris I appreciate your good photography skills. Been here since 2012 lets go another 10
Would love to see an Abroad in Japan Christmas Carol!
YOU GOT THIS CHRIS!
I've been following you for blinking years now... We love you
Please do the christmas carol!!
Love your channel, Chris! Found you whilst living in London in 2020 (Dane in disguise, ssh..!) and your videos helped me a lot through lock down. Your content helped me "escsape" and gave me a chance to experience the super cool sides of a country I've always wanted to visit! I really admire you for working out and starting to get healthy; so awesome! I found, the key for me, was to establish my own personal reasons for why I wanted to live more healthily and find exercise types that I genuinely found awesome to do.  Keep making great content and rockin' it! - Victoria Grace
Wow, you literally did the opposite of clickbait - you addressed the topic of the title within the first 2 minutes of the video AND before the sponsored part of the video. You never disappoint, Chris Broad
Ask a broad is different without the space.
Yesss Abroad in Japan Christmas Carol!! Anything you do is so high quality, it can only be amazing!
Hey Chris,  I just returned to the US from my trip to sendai (secretly wished I would run into you there). I stayed for about a month and enjoyed my time there. I’ve been watching your channel for years now. Keep up the good content👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽. You’ve inspired me and my girlfriend to try starting our own channel about life in Japan.
Do a christmas carol  But ryotaro needs to be scrooge obviously
Maybe you could put the full title of the episode at the top of the description of each video?
0:28 lets just say I'm glad you didn't abbreviate that title
I do believe it's been 24 hours now. I wonder if Chris is an official member of the Trash Taste Podcast yet, or if Connor needs another 24 hours?
Please please PLEASE do Abroad In Japan's A Christmas Carol!
Do japanese women realise how much westernised their society has become? White men wanting japanese wife because they cant handle their white women.
If you’re the raging narcissist you say you are I bet you’re dying for someone to mention it, so here it is I love how you synced all the exercise thuds up with the music and congratulations on 10 years of YouTube! (I’ve been watching for 7 and I’ve had a really good time so thanks!!)
Some people watch your videos because of the clickbait-y title and thumbnail. I hope most do because they know the content will be good, so they cope with the crappy imagery you're forced to use.
Why use superlatives when you could use superlaxatives?
I had to look up what a soapland was after it was mentioned in passing in a video, so that person isn't the only naive one!
what an affable man
I would rather have countries keeping their citizens safe than trying to make a bit of money of tourism. You cannot buy lives back nor health.
Love your Vdeos Chris but ............. Please do it again , in my mouth ?  HAHAHAHAHA my god im dying ahahaha  , thank you for all your hard effort and just being yourself.
Sake……rice wine, good thing they still make that stuff in Malaysia.
Please do a Christmas carol!
I love how he kind of 'mocks' those haters everytime hahah
9:23     😈
3:59 I love abandoned buildings explorations!
Coming next week: "Why Sharla broke up with me"
You did sharla dirty lol
Did anything think of Ben Askren when Chris was working on pads? 😂 good work Chris, noticed ur slimmer face from a few videos ago
Chris is so cheeky to the core- getting fit because **he wants to** not because of weirdos poking his belly all the time! Best revenge is to stunt on em Chris!
Glad I had my (solo) Japan trip back in 2018. I would love to go again but it's not in the cards anytime soon, it seems
Thank you for another great  video! ❤️❤️  you really do inspire me! 😊
I looked it up the other day and you need to also get a temporary visa along with a negative covid test and signing up to a tour group through a travel agency. So right now it's too bothersome to try and plan a trip to japan.
Feed the monkey to the bears
I kinda like that I can get a seat on the Hibiya line right now still but I know opening back up will be much better for tourism and the economy.
I can't wait until the cycle across Japan in Hokkaido! I love Hokkaido
Lol so seems all it takes for Japan to open its borders is for Chris to mention it. Japan just announced its opening its borders again, just a day after this video xD
A Christmas carol with Chris as Scrooge and Natsuke in literally all other roles will be my wish for Christmas this year
Go Chris get fit!!
Well this video aged well, border opens in 5 days 😀
Stop being mean to Sharla you crusty £#€¥ muppet.
I'm not ready for the beauty of a hunky Chris Broad. It will be blindy.
CdawgVA vs Abroad in Japan boxing match when?
Chris please do the Christmas Carol! It sounds ridiculous funny! Cast all your friends. I picture Natsuki as the ghost of past  Christmas. But I can't picture who Scrooch would be 😂
"Yes please! Do it again! In my mouth!" 9:25 🤣
"Open the country. Stop having it be closed," said the Chris Broad.
How many Japanese women you've banged?
Superlatives, difficult to pronounce?  Try SuPerlatives
I enjoy all of your videos. Keep up the great work.
Christmas Carol - definitely!!! Also I really enjoyed your conversation about YouTube and the game a lot of creators have to play. I was wondering if you could visit some traditional trade / skill / artists in Japan ? People who create whatever but in a very traditional Japanese way.
Some comments say "only business catering to foreign tourists suffer" but the importance of tourists $ goes well beyond that as it is an export category. By not allowing foreign travelers in they are worsening their trade balance big time, losing exports is much worse than any other unit of gdp of the same face value
I like how much you hate your thumbnails.
Just got in on Working Holiday visa, do recommend if you fit criteria.
Regarding the 'Clickbait Title' thing about the Journey Across Japan video in Hokkaido...  ...I don't just blanket watch all the videos, and despite wanting to watch the Journey series... serieses? Serii? I didn't even know that video was part of one of them. So now I'll go watch it, but the "twatty clickbait title" actually made me *not* watch the video.
Can you cut down the wackiness?
I have never heard "superlatives" pronounced like that: @8:02.
Weirdly enough, I learned not only about Japan banning Foreigners, I also love the answer you gave with starting to be a youtuber. genuinely one of the best advice I've heard. Thanks Chris!
I'm 36 now and I weigh 76kg, being 1,78 meters tall. In summer 2020 after three months of being chained to my lockdown home office desk, I came in on roughly...84kg. I usually run 40 km per week. In summer its sometimes more in winter its less (and I mostly run on the treamill in winter). During the lockdowns I couldnt go to the gym and jogging/running outsome was forbidden for some time. That made me realize how unhealthy my diet is. I mean if one gains 8 kg in three months or so, just because he doesnt go running in that time, that surely isnt normal. So my advise is that you cut down on calories. Losing weight just from doing sports hardly ever works out for the most poeple. I dont eat anything fried anymore (including chips) and I only eat bread 2 or 3 times a week, instead of 7 times. This simple change gave me such much more energy and it helps with the eye circles, which come from to many carbs.
Hope the next QnA isn't in 2024
Make Christmas Carol
Definitely do a Christmas Carol! Love your answer about being a youtuber. As for something to keep you fit, start running and aim for the big challenge like UTMF ;)  I hope Japan will fully open soon, I went there in 2016 alone and it was one of the greates trip in my life which I want to repeat but this time with my wife.
I just returned from 6 weeks in Japan and it was strange having to be "masked up" everywhere, getting your temperature taken to enter a restaurant, etc.  The visa process for coming to Japan, for US citizens, is starting to ease up a bit, as I have a trip planned for early November of this year, but it's still a pain in the ass.
Covid showed the world a much less appealing side of Japan. People that have lived here for several years are no longer saying positive things about it.
I'm with Japan on the booze.
I am so happy i managed to travel to Japan back in 2019. Especially when i've been so captivated by the country for over half my life. The trip was amazing and possibly the best experience ive had (also given i had a very difficult time before the trip). Would've never have guessed 2019 would be the final summer vacation for people to visit Japan before all this! Really want to visit again sometime in the future, 2 weeks is simply not enough!
Abroad in Japan a Christmas Carol: OH! YES!!
Loved the bit where you kidnap Connor...heh.  Honestly I really like your more serious videos, I know you've said before they don't do as well as your lighthearted ones you don't spend a ton of time on...but I appreciate the effort you put into them.  It's cool to see you working out! You're doing quite a bit of er...boxing? Any specific reason why? Does it burn a lot of calories?
YES PLEASE do An Abroad Christmas Carol!! 🎄✨
I've never heard anyone pronounce superlative like you.
Well done on the 'Focus on a skill set' comments! If you end up with an enormous following with big ad revenue, that's wicked. But it wont pay the bills in the meantime or future if it doesn't work out.  I do like the fitness montage at the end ha!
Chris ABs in Japan.
Shonkiest boxing display ever mate.   Gotta agree with a lot of things you said in this.  I’ve been here 20 years and felt weird about not being able to leave for fear of not being able to get back in to my wife and kids.  I think most people appreciate the efforts in cinematography even if they don’t consciously analyze it.   Hope you can reconcile your clickbait title conflicts.
I'm loving my typpsy subscription 😍 🙌,  can't wait to visit Japan some day when they open  😢
Well priced hitman...  "I'll knock off ya nan for 10 quid!"
hey chris. Another very funny video. I think that the Abroad in Japan Christmas Carol would be a great idea and hopefully Japan opens up to tourists soon. Do you have any tips for learning the grammar and the politeness levels of Japanese because this is what I struggle with the most. Thanks for all the effort you put into these videos and have a great day!
Hello there,  I was in Aberdeen for a month, and in all the shops, from big to tiny ones (big brands tho), all of them have sushi!!! Is that Your affect on culture?! 😃
Do the christmas thing pls i wouldnt mind the wait
chris should be in the next big youtuber boxing evernt
In the Abroad in Japan Christmas Carol, please let the rat be played by Ironmouse!
You should write an Alternative Guide to Japan! You have so much to say about unique, crazy and weird places! And I’m sure it would be funny too. Get the Japanese Tourist Board to support you as you will be boosting the re-opening of the country ;-)
The ultimate Journey across Japan would be making the full Shikoku Pilgrimage. It would be a physical challenge since it is hundreds of kilometres circumnavigating the whole of Shikoku on foot (if you do it the traditional way) and takes at least 40 days from start to finish if you do it all in one trip. But, aside from that, you must coordinate filming the journey and find ways to make some stretches where you go 2-3 days without seeing a new temple interesting.  But then again, Japan is full of varying challenges when you scratch beneath the surface.
Can’t wait to see the next influencer boxing card! Chris Abroad in Japan vs ConnorDawg Voice Actor!
@AbroadinJapan. Chris, I totally get your goal for a healthy lifestyle both physically and mentally. I have just turned 40 and I don't celebrate my birthday at all. I hate them as I just seem to use them to reflect back on the past, what have I done, have I achieved anything significant, what would I like to do in the future. You are making a great decision in using the medical report as a way of pushing your health goals. I have recently started with an instructor at my local gym and I do feel better for it, even if I don't look better at the moment. Full marks to you for another excellent Q&A and, as always, I look forward to seeing how your next projects pan out. All the best, Ben
I loved that workout video.
Amazing fitness montage at the end!
would definitely watch aboard Christmas Carol. make videos/ films that you want to that's why we watch.
That montage was epic! Well, the last scene was rather hilarious 🤣
I've watched PewDiePie vlog "you guys noticed something" then I realized.. on 7: 32 Ohhh Sh"t i was Chris Voice then later on Holy Cheese it is Chris!! I Hope and Looking for a Collab with PewDiePie
17:30 - This is legitimately a TERRIBLE example. I don't like the tour group plan either, but what kind of tour group isn't going to take you to Kiyomizu Temple in Kyoto? And being a Japanese company, not give you a faxed copy of the itinerary so you know what to expect out of at least the entire day's events?
You look better with longer hair !
Good luck with your challenge abrood
Gosh I PRAY (as an Atheist... so praying to Chtulu or the Spaghetti Monster or whichever entity will listen) that your words of Japan probably reopening before the end of the year is true... I have been saying "this is the year I finally go to Japan" since January 2020... Until then I live vicariously through your videos - so thank you for your always stellar content!
It’s funny that you mention how those particular video thumbnails are meant to grab your attention. But when I kept seeing them pop up from you, it actually made me not want to watch your videos 🥲From you specifically bc i felt like it wasn’t you, like your channel’s vibes. Also, I don’t know why but those type of over used and over-exaggerated thumbnails irritate me and make me turn off from a video. But I’m sure I’m like the minority in this lol
Interesting to hear about the politics keeping Japan closed, I kind of suspected that it was something like that but of course we don't hear that in the international news. I did hear of somehow who went on one of those guided tours this summer, I think she thought she'd have some free time to go out and see a kpop group over there, got disappointed in the tour and actually left early! I'll wait until they let me roam around on my own, I've got a plan of hostel and train hopping across Japan (and Okinawa some day).
Absolutely love a Muppet’s Christmas Carol. If you need an extra let me know, I’m only down in Kanagawa.
Abroad in a Pan... brilliant!
CHRISTMAS CAROL GO. CHRIS.
Is Chris's next fitness goal buy chance doing a ironman run or professional boxing match lol.
22:20-23:30 GOLD! Actually, best advice a "Youtuber" or "Influencer" has ever given! Thank you Chris!
the booming sound effect whenever chris punched waz funny
Chris for the creator clash? 👀
That workout montage made me feel tired just watching it - well done, keep it up!
The picture telling people to lock the toilet door reminds me of a sign I saw in Shin-Osaka station with the heading "How to use a toilet", informing people they were to sit on the toilet, not climb onto the seat and squat.
Should you spend a whole month working on 'Abroad In Japan's Christmas Carol'... As if you need to ask XD
Who the fuck would want to live in Japan, ppl are waaay to introverted scared of their own shadow LOL.
Wow, did you jump out to scare Sharla and took a picture of her?  Does she know you put it in this video?  Love the boxing videos.  Keep up the good work!
Simple! Because they don’t need tourists! 😝😂
The Kenko Shindan is a pretty interesting concept from a western perspective. It sounds so logical and practical. In the U.S. they always blather on about getting a "yearly physical" but it's not all that common (or affordable) and even when it happens, the end result is a doctor rattling off what you are doing wrong in a rushed, condescending brief.
"Super lative"? That's not how it is pronounced...
What's a "super-lative"? (8:01). Does help you go to the lavatory?
keep at it king!!!!
I'm very afraid of a diversified Japan. It would no longer be Japan if this ever happened. So I am certainly not unhappy about this.
I'm glad you had a montage. Even Rocky had a montage.
I love to visit Japan after almost 3 years... Of pandemic restrictions. Why so troublesome Japan? Now we still need to go through travel agency to book?? And not accepting ppls who uses China vaccine? Good luck cos I've decided I will skip Japan lol. Too stressful 😂 do you know that 90% I my work place got covid and all of them didn't take sinovac or sinopharm? The rest of 10% who took sinovac was not infected at all!! And I'm one of them 🤣🤣
As of the evening of 2 September JST, out of the 35 or 40 hours so far that CDawgVA has streamed it, I've been watching you guys cycling across Hokkaido.  Not going to lie...if there was a road bike of a certain durability that could handle all 132 kg of me for several hundred km, I'd try riding along with you in spirit (since, well, I'm in the US and couldn't actually be there even if I wanted to right now).  Might go to the gym and just watch the VODs while riding an exercise bike, even.  I'm down about 8 kg in the past 7 weeks myself, and aiming to lose at least another 48...if I can do it, I'd say nearly anyone could.  You got this, mate.  Keep up the good work :) .
5:25 R.I.P. sharla, chris casually burned her to the ground with that picture 🤣
It pains me that so many people can not visit Japan to this day. Next year, I will finally go ahead and fulfill my dream since I am 13, next year 24: Living in Japan. Luckily for me, I’m a german citizen and we have a working holida visa here for Japan. Out of all countries you can do it in, Japan has the most hurdles right now but it is absolutely possible if you save up enough money.
I was wondering, do you always bring a drone with you on your journeys?
Beast mode. Love it Chris! Boxing is a great way to get fit.
I love the "OH NO" because for some odd reason the characters don't look the slightest bit Japanese
Please use DragonBall Soundtrack for your gym videos!
I'm tempted to say something stupid just so my comment can feature in a video 😂
What software do you use for editing?
LETSS GOOOO MR CALFFABLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I would have clicked this video sooner if it would have said it was a video answering questions.
I hope your road to getting healthier goes well! I've recently started, too- tired of my unhealthy lifestyle. Staying motivated long enough to make it a routine is the real challenge for me, lol.
I love your Youtube persona. It is funny and I like the deadpan humor. Although I am not a sarcastic person, I appreciate the effort that goes into the scripting. The storyline is fluid and the cinematography is high quality.
looks like someone has been contacted by iDubz
Ohhh so thats what chris was editing during the cycling🤣🤣🤣 connors kidnapping
bc of my dad i've watched british television and always saw bbc as a staple on journalism and documentaries since i was a little kid. i really like how it influences chris, maybe that's why i started watching him and felt familiar somehow  i can't see chris doing youtube 20 years from now trying to please THE ALGORetc you know the youtube gods. i wouldn't put documentaries behind him, it would be a wasted talent  ps. i love the batman connor video so much
People who say "I want to be a Youtuber slash influencer" are like people who say "I want to be famous". Except for very pretty girls, that's not something you can just do without having some focus on a certain passion or subject. Just making a Youtube channel with random videos hasn't worked out for anyone - you need to find a subject or a style that people love and will repeatedly watch. Like you said, it's better to start one from a place of passion & knowledge than just aim for an end goal without knowing a clear way to get there.
YES WE WANT A CHRISTMAS CAROL!
Please Abroad in Japan Christmas Carol… please
I don't think Chris realizes but he definitely isn't as over weight as he thinks he is. I think being in Japan and seeing everyone around you being very thin can definitely make you think your over weight causing you to feel self conscious about your weight. It also doesn't help having many people joke about his weight but you gotta realize everyone has different body types some people are naturally more thin and some people  naturally seem to be over weight but you can be healthy or unhealthy being both. This is just my opinion but Chris doesn't look over weight to me. What matters is how your health is and I'm glad that is what he is working towards.
Sorry to sound out of pocket but damn Chris-chan looking fine.
Yes. Please do Abroad in Japan: A Christmas Carol
Next fitness montage is gonna be Chris punching the bag off its chain.
Drink green tea more
I love tha Japan still makes it difficult to enter. All the whining about Japan doing Japanese things, SMH.
This fatboy gets to train with Nicholas Pettas?! damn
Based chris is best chris
tarumlüg rutangisnetauq   Programmierer  der  Master K. I.       …
And your second most cinematic shot is Connor dancing in a hotel window.
are you surprised?  you realise mate if pressed they regard you as a hairy white ape :)  racism at its finest.  I hope you squeeze the controversy of these pricks to the maximum.
I've been waiting for Journey Across Japan, and I had no idea that the clickbait videos WERE Journey Across Japan, so I've been putting off watching them. :( Sorry you have to do that, but now I know, I look forward to catching up.
that is the first i've heard of that policy.
They let Pewdiepie in though? Or is it different when it's big stars?
I have a strong suspicion that the real reason for needed to book through agencies has hardly anything to do with preventing the spread of Corona and more to do with the Japanese government trying to prop-up the dying travel agency industry. Japan has a long history of trying to prop-up dying industries, even spending millions through their "cool Japan" initiative to build an overpriced department store in Malaysia. And during the Go-To campaign they did the same thing, 50% off Shinkansen tickets but ONLY if you book a package through a travel agency.
Niwa no uguisu is actually “the garden nightingale” not the other way around…
Abroad in Japan Christmas Carol LETS GOOOOO!!!!!  Also woah just realized I'm not much older then you are.  I'm going on a journey myself to get healthier.  Good news, statistically we're doing this at a great time!  Apparently getting healthier before 40 really improves your quality of life after you become elderly.  So high five man, let's get healthier!  We can do it!
"do it again, in my mouth" brilliant
stomach like mount fuji was the best comment ever
13:28 by far the best part😂😂😂
And with that picture, Chris became single again
Where the full version of Chris's training arc
That bear joke was pretty grizzly
Sunday! Sunday! Sunday! Like on pay-per-view. Creator Clash 2: 2025!!!   CDawgVA vs Abroad in Japan.   HAJIME!
Please do the christmas carol, and youre right the muppets one is the best
If Japan opens up, the Yen will rise in value. Time to buy some
Quick pitch: health being something you want to include maybe a series of vids just walking interesting routes. Going places sans automobile and show off pretty parts of it. Why stop with bikes?
yup, I'll definitely be waiting until it's back to normal to visit.  I want to go where I want to go,  when I want to go, not follow someone else's itinerary. It's a lot of money and I want to enjoy myself and not waste it.  add on- keep up the hard work! sometimes people expect the weight to just fall off and miraculously get shredded in a month but that's not the case for the average joe. stay consistent and keep grinding!💪
old ppl dislike foreigners. young ppl generally just go "meh". so yeah. do have a korea trip, have a look at actual modern technology, kpop or whatever, food is good. y keep putting japan on a pedestal if they dont want u there?
That fitness montage was something straight out of Cobra Kai fr
No offense but if this goes on long enough, I really hope other countries start retaliating and start putting reciprocal visa restrictions on Japanese citizens because it’s just not fair that they can go to our countries scott free while we get the North Korean treatment with a minder along with having to go through the length process of applying for a visa at the embassy.  I’m sure that will put them into a position to open up and put this endless game of bait and switch to an end.
Sharla is going to destroy you lol god speed
Philosophical questions... Let's see... Is your idea of good and evil indissociable from society? Or to put it another way: if there was only one person in the universe, do you think it would be possible for them to commit evil?  Hmm, maybe that's a bit too heavy. Is a hot-dog a sandwich?
Its the punching on beat for me 😂😂👌✨ Go Chris go!
Yen is worthless, still worth 3 times my countries currency *awkward chuckle*
This is the probably the longest Japan has been closed down since their isolation period
ABSOLUTELY do the christmas carol YES
Working out..,looks like you need a Calpis...not water. The pis of Californians will take your workout to the next kevel.
Congratulations on your 10 year's on YouTube, I really appreciate every video and the whole information and community you've built up. Greetings from Venezuela Chris,  Keep up with your amazing, informative and entertaining Videos.
that video of you reviewing chips jajajaj had me dying
Japanese govt is full of old men making stubborn policies.......not mentioning the fact they dont realize how much their economy is heavily reliant on tourism.
If it's a matter of not feeling good, I understand why you would wanna get fit. Otherwise, honestly you legit look really good. There's just way too many fatphobic people in the world, and you're not morbidly fat by any stretch of the imagination either.
Nice training montages with 'junk food Japan'
Absolutely loved the vulnerability you showed talking about your health and desire to change it. Way to be! I'm also taking steps to getting healthier after recovering from covid. Best of luck to you.
So how do you get more pepper if you want it
I see Chris is practicing at being a bottom 24:54
Ryotaro - Scrooge Joey - Scrooge Employee ( Father of Tiny Tim) Chris/Connor - Tiny Tim (act as British as possible.  Extra British.) Natsuki - All of the spirits of Christmas.  (You can dress him up.)  PLEASE do this.
I think you look fine, Chris. Wish you were still single! 😉
10:22 Jumpscare warning
Please don't let that be the last 80s synth workout montage.   We all loved seeing them in 80s movies for a reason and I'm sure i'm not the only one that wants to see you end up fit enough to fight Ivan Drago in the end.   Get after it man you got this!
Love what work you always put into your videos 💚 they're awesome 💚 wish you could be a bit more free with what you want to do really than having to always look after the algorythm 🥺
PLEASE DO A CHRISTMAS CAROL!!! I live in Japan too, and there's not enough Christmas in my life. *sob*
Huh so that's why Connor didn't uploaded for a long time...........
raising future alcoholics....not gonna help to increase the birth rate haha
You can do it Chris! 💪
Really liking the Ask a Broad segment
NOOOOOOOOO! The first subscription box I wanted and it delivers to USA only! :(
like your cut g
Oh, please, yeeees do an Abroad in Japan Christmas Carol!
At this point Japan is overrated. I was so excited to go but after hearing the issues with treatment towards women and people other than their own, I'm just not into the hype anymore. Sure, I would die to see the cherry blossoms at its peak but not at the expense from what I've heard lately
Good luck Chris! You’re first journey across Japan inspired my weight loss journey and continues to motivate me. Lost 51 lbs already and determined to keep going :)
Great advice on the youtube bit. I agree.
Good on you got getting fit. Smash it.
I didn't take care of my self in my 20;s and 30's had a heart attack at 42. Take care of yourself now and don't end up like me.
So true about Japanese youtubers.... tech channels are the worst.  Litteraly: open the laptop, praise the look and screen and how well it plays Netflix, that's it.
Chris I really enjoyed this video.  Like many others I too feel your film making is fantastic from beginning to end.  I know it has been said but the clarity in both sight and sound shows your concern for the viewer.  Each and every darn one is fun to watch.  Chris you are extremely talented and my family and I feel you can do anything in the industry you put your mind to.  I will simply end this comment to say thank you so very much.
You should do " A Very Natsuki Christmas Carol " lol
You know one of the ironic things about the government saying that the Japanese need to drink more Alcohol, I am sure the Tourists would be doing a lot of drinking, and I am sure there are a lot of Gaijin can hold their alcohol pretty well too so um... Japanese government... *makes hand movements to one side*
IM ngl its kinda crazy to me that he thinks he's that overweight. He could be in better shape forsure, most of us could, but its nowhere near what I would consider being in a BAD shape or overweight.
Thank you for your hard work. It's very impressive and entertaining.  If you want to be healthier: Michael Mosley - "The clever gut", David Sinclair - "Lifespan".
My tourist business in Japan is so dead😅
Chris: *teaches english in japan for years Everyone: Utterly shocked to see a picture of him teaching something
Congratulations on 10 years!
Time for a second channel with those shots, where it can be appreciated.
Congratulations on 10 years on YouTube..Cheers 🥂
SUGOI! AMAZING! BRILLIANT!   But no, I really do love all of your videos. I always look forward to the videos you release. They are all very well done and enjoyable to watch. I wish you all the success and hope you can continue to put out the videos you want!!!
um yeah make the christmas carol movie
Chris is preparing for next Creator's Clash?
Anyone else worried that he's drinking from a box!!
when you're ldr and your bf is in Japan and I'm sitting here like 🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂 Japan pls
Chris you forgot this one: You+Watanabe= Smash?
Chris I love this channel but you do look a bit like Kim Jong Un with that hair cut
Pokémon just announced that the world championship ( for VGC, TCG, etc) for next summer is in Japan so they have to at least open it by then.
i see Chris is getting a head start and practicing for Creator Clash 2 for his fight with Connor
Let me get this straight, The Japanese government whats their young people to become unhealthy alcoholics who will eventually lead to more hospitalizations and domestic abuse, in the hopes of boosting its economy. Is the government drunk?
100,000,000% do the christmas carol idea. I'm afraid I need to see Natsuki as one of the 3 ghosts lol
Yassss.  A Muppet Christmas Carrol is my favorite version!  Glad to see I'm not the only one who holds it in high regard.
Wish we had a sign like that to lock the door in the bathroom at work. Can't count the amount of amount of times I've walked in on someone shitting  because they didn't properly lock the door.
"please do it again in my mouth" uuuuuuhhh...
Chris vs KSI next match let’s go
I wanted Montage of Chris working out to push it to the Limit
Didnt they just announce the ban being lifted Sept 7th?
your not wrong the most cinematic shot you ever done is of Connor.
Great video man thanks so much! Congratulations on 10 years bro!!! You inspired me to move to japan! Unfortunately 5 months in covid pushed me out but my passion for the country never faded and I can’t wait to get back
It's a weird thing to call out, but those tempo synced punches in the montage were excellent.
Yes do a Christmas carol and use all the muppets you know and love it will be amazing!
You did sharla dirty 🤣
I very much wanted to go to Japan this coming year, but it seems that the government has continued to hold back, even after the recent elections. Why? Everything I see, reflects pandemic reactions and practices of a year ago. Are infection rates so high in Japan? Is the caution overblown?  I did see that it had opened up a bit to tours, versus individual travelers, but there seems to be more hoops that have to be jumped through. I eventually decided to pass on Japan for the time being. My major concern was, after jumping through hoops to do a guided tour of parts of Japan, that there would be some last-minute shutting down of typical tourist sites and destinations. I guess this could happen anywhere, but the seeming edginess of Japan, suggests it may be more prone to this than other countries (perhaps even those with more active cases).  What are others' thoughts, but also facts bearing on Japan being more open to tourism?
How you got your permanent residence permit? Can I contact you by mail?
With 2.71M subscribers do you still NEED to have those clickbait titles? They are quite confusing when trying to find the Journey across Japan’s episodes.
9:18 Chris speaking about how women need to be in bed
It's funny how alot of countries declining in population are trying to bring in more foreign people and workers, yet japan is doing the opposite
I don't get the fat jokes. I've seen fat, and Chis is not it.
Congrats on 10 years! Christmas is also my favorite holiday by far, please make that Christmas documentary!
Let’s do it Chris! Let’s aim for a hot girl summer bod for next year!
Chris has been in Japan so long that he forgot how ”superlative” is pronounced 😬😅
Do it.
Now I want to see Abroad in a Pan lol
Next depression Japan gets, "Please tourists, visit Japan..." 🤷‍♂
Thanks Chris just ordered a mystery box of sake. 😭
I like the way there was even space for garnt to be the rat in a Christmas Carol but nope 😂 taken for garnted once again
Join a judo club?
Love your take on focusing on the craft instead of beeing a "youtuber" or "tiktoker". Cheers mate
If you do Abroad in Japan's Christmas Carol, with songs (like the Muppets did) - you will have my undying adoration.
Go past yubari in hokkaido on your bike
For the first time Abroad actually looks sincere and honest about his time in Japan and the real realities of what it takes to work and live in such a country.
Time is a flat circle for the western vlogger in Asia.
Abroad In Japan Christmas Carol needs to happen. I didn't know I needed it, and now I can't live without it.
I love Japan and it's people, but their culture of praising virtually everything actually makes me think they are very disingenuous. I like genuine brutal honesty so I know exactly where I stand and what someone truly thinks me. It's how you earn and establish true respect.
9:26
ill be waiting for that christmas carol
We booked our flight in may on oct 1st and today made the decision that we wont fly because restrictions make it almost impossible. that was really a punch in the gut for me.
Christmas Carol…..you son of a bitch. I’m in 👌🏻
Lately I haven’t been watching your videos bc it looks like clickbait lol now I have to go back and watch them bc your humor is A1 and you have amazing content
I got a trip booked to Japan in 4 weeks which obviously isn't going to happen. Thought things would of been back to some sort of normal by now. Gutted
Curiosity Stream? Also it's only cool when 12 to faux insult a girl you like..... Finally, I won't ridicule someone for wrong pronunciation as it shows it's been read.....and yet "superlative",,,, I'm hoping you can give me inspiration and determination as I need to lose a 1/5 of my body weight in 3 months... Ivan Drago's in a cold sweat after that montage!    (wrong instalment but you get the point :))
Japanese government: Our economy is suffering, what should we do? Foreign tourists: Maybe let us come spend some money in your country? Japanese government: I know! Tell everyone to drink more beer!
SUGOI VIDEO Chris Desu
As a Brit I find the relentless happiness of the Japanese insufferable, in my country when you ask somebody "How are you doing" they respond with the reasonable and appropriate response "alright".
I'm on my own health journey right now. It so good to see you taking yours seriously. I worry about you feeling so miserable. I know how it feels. So I'm excited to see you strengthen your mind and your body. Good luck my British friend. I'll be here still watching all your videos.
Are you really supposed to drink out of that box?
I love it that you picked up boxing! I'm all about picking an exercise that translates to a practical skill. The better you get at it, the more you want to train, and you get fit at the same time! Two birds with one stone.
Happy 10 years, Capt Jack Sparrow! 😉 I have loved following you for all of these years, Chris. I would adore to see an Abroad in Japan Christmas Carol! Jusz do eet!!!!  As for Japan's new isolationist policies, I'm very, very sad.  I visited Japan about 10 years ago and it's SUCH a beautiful country with so much to see.  But, I found that the most beautiful sights were off the beaten path.  Visiting the Tokugawa shrine in Nikko or taking a boat ride while you stare up at Mt. Fuji-san are nowhere on those "planned, strict grade-school-like" ridiculous tours being offered currently.  I hope Japan doesn't regress to 50 years ago like the USA is currently attempting to do. 😞  Loved the "1980s" montage, but you're missing the leg warmers. 😉🤣
I love the two neon signs in the background of the studio!
Nice effect with the dry ice in the cup, looking like steaming hot tea throughout the video, except at the very end.
For the love of god, We need a Trash Taste x Abroad in Japan Powerlifting special !
Still not got one of those new Brexit freedom passports?  I gather the freedom feeling is in direct inverse proportion to the number of countries it no longer permits you unfettered access to!?  FML
Are you not able to buy and carry bear spray in Japan? Is it not legal to hunt bears? I would think that bear hunting would be implemented to help manage their population if they're that bad.
Congrats on 10 years!
I actually like your thumbnails and they don’t really come off as clickbait that’s just me tho, but keep up the great content and congrats on 10 year anniversary👍
Just so long as you replace Ebenezer Scrooge with Dr. Ebenezer Jelly, and have the Ghost of Christmas Rysottaro and Ghost of Christmas Volcano
Christmas Carol, but Scrooge is played by Natsuki. 100%. I can see him saying things like “Have a fucking Christmas” or “Oh damn its a ghost”
Omg yes Abroad in Japan Christmas Carol!! I need this xD
Sharla is going to kill you 😂😂😂
Japan has the highest COVID infection rate in the world right now. They must be trying to protect the rest of the world…
Only if you play tiny Tim and your alter ego is Scrooge
Thanks for your unique videos about Japan and good luck with your physical endeavours.
Chris love your videos as always, but for the love of god... UPDATE YOU EQUIPMENT LIST DOWN IN THE DESCRIPTION BOX!!!
visiting japan has a time limit for me. my connection in japan will eventually leave japan, and after that, I would likely not go.
I wonder if you could drive within FPV flying range of the spooky school in a fairly tough car, you could go in there using a drone and get some footage, and worst case scenario you lose your drone and camera, not your face. Maybe if you could do a live reaction it would be exciting even if the drone crashed. I enjoy your videos and podcast, keep it up!
Tourists can't Enter? my Friend just entered japan from the Philippines just yesterday O_o. im confused.
Personally I'd click quicker if you'd name journey across Japan episodes as actual tv show episodes. But that's just me.  Besides I kinda like the delicious irony of your clickbait titles.
😂😂😂
They turned Wano into a real thing
Well done for all the hard work you put into getting YOURSELF fit again! I personally get a massive hit from this as my life slides into shit and those videos give me a hit of, 'get your ass up and do fucking something that you don't like because it will serve you in the long run". Thanks Chris. You help me and this way I will help you! Keep it coming, mate! Thomas
TIL that Temple University has a satellite campus in Japan, who would have thunk it?
KEEP WORKING OUT CHRIS
That Christmas video sounds fire
The affable Chris does it again! So affable there isn’t a single dislike!
Chris: "ABROAD IN A PAN!" A cooking series where I go to the homes of friends and family- Me: Omg! No, Chris, that sounds amazing! A cooking series with your friends sounds like it would do really well- Chris: where I inadvertently burn down their kitchens- Me: ...nevermind.
I understand the love/hate with tourists. I live in a beach town in NC and it's overwhelmingly bad here in the summer as far as crowds and traffic and trying to live normal life. That being said, they are a huge part of the economy. I don't even go to the beach in the summer...I usually just go before or after. It goes from smothering each other shoulder to shoulder to not a soul in sight pretty quick when the season is over.
Ever thought abour partnering with Nebula? Might give you the chance to do stuff you actually want to do.
If you made a version of 'a Christmas carrol ' that would be amazing!!!
Christmas Carol. Please.
Young...
Make the Christmas carol happen !!
I wouldn't want to drink something out of a wooden box.
Wow 10 years, I have been watching your videos since when you had first moved to Japan.
Why not beans? Seriously. You can never outrun your true desires.
Chris has read the word superlative but never heard it being read. :D
I like the haircut, it makes you look younger
actually really good advice
I think your thumbnail is not clickbait, it's straightforward which I like.  Youtuber from my country is more like "I GOT ATTACKED BY THIS!!!!" but it's actually just food, they eat good food that's all
5:26 annnnnnd just like that Chris is a single man again lmao.
Chris started to look like Viktor Orban. Atleast bot of them getting rich now.
My burning question to u is, r u worried about the current China threat? 🤔
the montage was great! next Q&A please only ask philosophy questions next time. Let's learn about how Chris thinks!
people are so damn mean, I'm sorry they write that stuff!
The comment about your stomach looking like .mount fuji made me laugh so hard 😂😂😂
Can you do a video on haunted locations in Okinawa
Good thing you're trying to look after your health!! It's hard when people are rude because you don't even look bad at all.
i love the muppets christmas carol and would absolutely love to see the abroad in japan x trash taste x tokyo creative version
The way he pronounces "superlative."  Is that the British pronunciation or is it just wrong?
I'm the odd one who avoids the clickbatey stuff and have not watch the videos you mention because of the title and thumbnail. But with your explanation I might have to change... Nah screw it YouTube need to change.
"what's the thought process behind taking the perfect shot?"  @10:22 ... i'd say schaudenfreude. 😀
You shave 10 years off your age when you shave that mustache off. I enjoyed the video Chris thank you so much have a great weekend
The statement Chris made about him hating the term “influencer” and focus on the skill and art you want to share on social media is the best advice anyone can give to people wanting to be on YouTube or other platforms. I too believe that social media should be the platform that people share their passion with the world. If there is no passion in the work, not many people will want to watch it.
Interestingly pronounciation of superlative! 🤔 ha ha great video
Chris, I really hope you enjoy boxing, it's a great way to make working out fun. I swear, once you get good at it you get lost in the rhythm and it becomes like playing DDR or Guitar Hero. Just remember get lots of sleep and to breathe out with each punch.
I subbed to this channel 8 years ago to learn Japanese and now it's become one of the most premiere channels for traveling around Japan. Amazing journey so far.
Population shrinking rapidly?  Solution: people drinking rapidly!  Great plan, Japan.
Chris, I was a less successful version of you 20 years ago. I lived in Sendai for nine years. When I came there I weighed 140 pounds, when I left I was a fat 200 pounds. I tried various ways of losing the weight but the only one that worked long term was intermittent fasting. I guarantee it works and it is quite simple. There are a thousand videos on Youtube explaining it but the basic rule is toonly eat during an 8 hour window of your day. You can do it. :)
You've definitely lost weight Chris, keep up the good work
10 years congratulations!!!! 🎉🎉👏🏼👏🏼👍
Chris the affable hitman
Would be nice for them to open the borders for real and not via tourist groups like I've seen online. As someone who has lived there as an exchange student, It would be nice to roam around and see my friends as opposed to having to follow a guide
congrats to 10 years abroad in japan! what a cool q&a.. what is your lives phylosophy chris?
The best Q&A on You Tube that I've seen, and I'm not being Japanese about it! I thoroughly enjoyed it and chuckled at least 3 times. Congratulations on the 10 years and best of luck on getting fit. Believe me, as someone in her late 40's, I was in the best shape of my life in my mid to late 30's. You can definitely do it and it feels incredible!
I did a similar lifestyle change at your age. I took up my old sport (equestrian) and started spending my weekends at the stable rather than bars and clubs, just because it made me so much happier. Both my mental health and my physical health has improved.  Top tip: if you do get injured, see a physiotherapist or doctor specialized in sports medicine for a rehab plan.
Chad broad in Japan
Just remember, Chris: You can't outrun a bad diet! Good luck, I'm losing weight as well. About 12lbs/5.5kg down so far. It's seriously been 80% diet (eating less), 20% going for walks.
I just realized I am not subbed after watching you off and on for years. Good content keeps people coming back. Keep up the good work, and thank you for the countless laughs. You do dry humor very well.
KEEP ON GOING CHRIS!!!
@10:00 ...and incredibly painful to watch.
About to apply for my Japanese passport at the embassy - only way I can get back in is to *ahem* bend *ahem* the rules regarding dual citizenship! 😔
Please for the love of christ make a Christmas carol. Ryotaro as Scrooge, Natsuki as Bob Cratchet.
Yes! Do Christmas Carol! Yessss!!!!!!🤗🤗🤗
Great video as always. But I was hoping for a bit more on the tourist ban.  All the best!
Totally thought you were training with Sylvester Stallone at first
Your doing a great job ! ♥️
I would absolutely love to see you do an Abroad in Japan Christmas Carol video!!!
Yes! Make your Christmas Carole!!!
I won't lie the set behind Chris is very nice to see in these videos aside from a blank wall with a few Accessories no offense. LOVE THE CONTENT CHRIS
We planned to visit Japan this summer, but had to cancel it due to the closing. Hoping to be able to due it in July 2023. Planning a Road Trip from North to the South.
Good luck getting unto better shape Chris! I'm a big mouth myself and hope we can both stick on our exercise and dieting!  It'd be cool to see a video of your exercise and maybe how gyms and fitness are in Japan, if you don't feel too private about it.
If they let tourists in, they would prosper as a country and they would also have more funds for things that are needed
Oh yeah.  Your arms are gummy noodles, bag work, more bag work, then the boxer/teacher may pop you a good one, "DEFEND YOUR FACE'.  But your arms are so heavy, and that's so high.  Then back at it, till you die.  But somehow, you don't die.  BACK TO THE PIT.  And that's how you get fit.  Also, back to the pit!
That outro was great!  Good on ya for working up a sweat!  BTW, you are killing it on this Hokkaido bike ride.  Well done!
You have to make Abroad in Japan A Christmas Carol mate. 🎄 Would love to see it
Yes if there's one thing westerners tend to loathe it's being told what to do, set agenda's. It's obviously a tactic to pay lip service to the older demographic whilst opening the door slightly to say ..seee we're letting people in! Politicians ruin businesses without regard.
I hope I can just be in Japan freely. I got money to spend and I consider Japan my second home being half Japanese. My goal: Summer of 2024
What video was the connor on top of sendai station being batman from?
I've wanted to visit my Japanese teacher in Nagoya after lockdown and discovered the current restrictions. Looking forward to next march maybe!
Sharla could be the Ghost of Christmas Future after showing that photo of her.  I can see it now…..Chris playing  Scrooge, leans over the grave shown to him by Sharla in a long, flowing, torn black gown and then…..boot….you would get kicked in that 6’ deep hole in the ground……😜
Maybe with all that training we finally get the abroad in japan wrestling video ;)
I recently noticed in my homecountry, that all things Japanese are really so much in fashion here, in the last years, despite covid, more Japanese restaurants opened up, articles about Japanese food and recipes all over the magazines, Japanese stores opening. Manga everywhere. Etc.... There was a similar obsession and interest in Japanese art and culture in the 1900. And as the interest for Japan is growing in the world, Japanese people say:"nah, no interest. Stay away." Sigh. 🙄
Su-per-la-tive *
That advice to the 10 year old kid was just the worst. “Pick exactly what you want to do and do that and nothing else”… come on. Kid, if you read this, here is some better advice: just start and make any video you can. You might find that you actually really like editing or setting up the scene or something completely different, but you won’t learn that unless you try. So give it a go, make mistakes, and learn as you go.
Yes please, do it again - in my mouth - Chris 2022
Can't believe it has been 10 years. I can still remember finding the video of a random Brit talking about Japan in his living room. Lovely to see that the humour is still there and quality always goes up. Well done Chris!
I had so many study abroad trips cancelled the last 2 years…. I just want to go to japan 😢
I can't help but think that the wooden box looks cool as a drinking vessel, but not half as practical as a simple glass, cup or mug? More difficult to drink from, more difficult to keep clean, I assume?
make a kickstarter for Abroade in Japans Christmas Carol. I really wanna see the ghost of the future and your take on what you do when you will be old. I think it will be the most funny christmas story on the platform.
Still waiting for "Taken for Garnted"
No comments from Sharla. Why could that be...
That montage was GOLD! That’s awesome you’re doing some boxing…it’s a great workout and fun too. I’m hopeful Japan will open up again soon.
yes calander !!!!!!!
Those thumbnails and titles actually turn me off. The only reason why i watch you, is cause your videos are good, the clickbait isn't too ridiculous and i can ignore those, but I'd say that in general I didn't watch more videos because of something like that than caused me to watch it.
"It's better than the last supper!" Made me laugh out loud to myself. My dad was so confused about why I was laughing so hard.
Literally has become my favorite YouTube channel in the past few weeks, aspire to visit Tokyo some day with a grasp of the language, will contribute to your channel when I can, very educational.
What FABULOUS advice to someone wanting to be a YouTuber. YouTube (believe it or not) won't be around forever, but film-making, voice-acting, etc is applicable in so many areas. Make YouTube your tool, not your career :)
Well, we know Connor can't lock the toilet door, since he doesn't even close it
its my birthday Chris its my birthday so i command you to do a Christmas muppets show
I rarely comment on these but I just wanted to chip in and say that you really should be proud of your drone work! It does an excellent job of getting across the landscape in these places in ways that the intensely close and human-scale videography doesn't show. Humans don't live in the narrow gaze of a fixed camera; our eyes drift, our heads swivel, etc. That's made your drone work the most exceptional part of the Journey Across Japan videos, because they give a wider perspective and let you get more of a "feel" for the area.  So, y'know, please feel proud! You do good stuff.
Keto is they way to go. Get the carbs and sugar out of your diet, your fat will disappear.  Plus you will be healthier.
Good for you VIP. Being De Big doesn't have to be a life-long curse.
Well we will need to wait a bit more for them to open up so you have more freedom to explore the whole of Japan. I can understand the political aspect for sure but in the long run the economy would take a massive hit only for those extra votes, hopefully it will change someday in the future.
Don't do it but also do it
I got a great question for you: How can feet smell if they don't have a nose Follow-up: How can a nose run, if it doesn't have feet
You probably gave the most reasonable advice I've ever heard when asked "how to become a YouTuber?"
I'm trying to get my shit together too man, easier said than done. Keep up the great work, Chris.
Great seeing you getting fit! Love seeing you doing boxing aswell. Fitness wise Boxing is one of the best sports you could do. Keep it going!
I didn't know i wanted an abroad in japan Christmas carol until you mentioned it, PLEASE
07:00 Yes  With 2.7 mill subscribers, don't you think your videos would survive without being carried by the algorithm? Are your view count that dependent on random viewers that don't subscribe? I would think that most subscribers would watch all your videos.   Please don't push yourself too hard in these months so you grow tired of exercise. Physical wellness is not a short term stint, but a lifelong project and challenge. It really means that you have to change how you live your life forever. Less junkfood, more home cooking, no more late nights editing, more outdoors activities.
Tell you what. If Japan opens its doors soon, then I will come and drink their alcohol. To help the economy of course. Deal?  Also, we definitely need your version of A Christmas Carol. I want Natsuki as one of the ghosts.
Chris are you getting prepared for creator clash???
I've been to Japan twice, and I have friends who moved and live there, and I can't imagine needing to be on a forced guided tour at all. If I need a tour, my friend and his family can show me around Okinawa, lol. I hope Japan stops this and reopens.
(23:59) Alright, what is the secret to inner peace Abroad-san.
"Yes please, Do it again, In my mouth" Chris 2022
2:23 They spelt "colours" wrong...
Why the frick is ma man drinking out of a box?
Loved the montage at the end!
Hey Chris, you look like you've lost some weight! I remember you saying you were trying to in an earlier vid so congratulations on the progress 😁
Honestly, you should try to run for mayor of Sendai.  If you can meet Ken Wantanabe, you've made it in Japan.
FFS STOP SAYING SUPERLATIVES WRONG ! " " " (/-_-\)" " "
I would love to see you visiting some popular and interesting winter/holiday locations and activities i am sure must be some stuff to check out?
😳🤪😖 I stopped by,I don't know why.
If anyone can get you in shape Chris it would be Nicholas Pettas
I hate the word influencer too. YouTuber seems so much better but I guess influencers aren’t restricted to YouTube. So an influencer is just someone people pay attention to and they buy stuff they tell them to buy right? For no good reason?
Well, this has aged terribly LMAO
You could have a black screen on your thumbnail and I will watch them anyway :) Your channel is one of the best content I enjoy watching. And great you are putting effort on getting back on shape!
Dont you usually show or do everything that your thumbnail depicts, how is that clickbait?
*gets a girlfriend and leaves her for weeks on end to go cycling with Connor* 🤔
DO IT
Pewdiepie likes working out nowadays. Maybe you guys could work out together :D
My October trip to Japan had to turn to my October trip to Korea lol. Not upset was still planning to go to Korea at some point and I'm excited but I hope I can have my trip to Japan soon 😊
Chris, love your advice regarding being a YouTube vs being an artist, videographer, etc. Wisdom right there. And, you do look excellent on that photo!!
With the extended circle of friends and acquaintances you have both 3d and 2d you could make an amazing version of a Christmas Carol. I say go for it, if not this year then the next, so you can have enough time.
I would would love if you made another channel and just explored some of these more artistic ideas you have and show a side of Japan you want to show, instead of a more click-baity video. While I enjoy your videos I want to see a new take on Japan from a someone who's been there for a hot minute.
Me: *sees As on health report card "hey that  looks pretty good" Chris "nothing short of appalling and really quite bad" Me: 😮
Do it!
TOTALLY YES to abroad in Japan Christmas carol!!!!! FUCK YEAH!
Joey: Japan is FINALLY letting foreigners into the country Aki: japan wil NOT let foreigners into the coutry  Chris: Why japan still BANS foreigners after 2 years
Thx for making my 30 mins  wile i eat my pitza  between game and more game enjoyable, hope ur trials for this year go great and i can continue to enjoy my pitza pause ^^. U re great m8, for 10 more years of abroad in hapan.
What is your favourite training montage scene in any movie?
Chris. Just want to say, I hope I can buy you some sake someday and shoot the breeze. I love your content, and wish you best of luck in your future.
Doesn't sound unfair at all. Their country, their rules, they should have privileges in their own country.
That montage was so epic!
This was an awesome bit of telly! Cheers Chris!
whats with them flappy punches right there, put more energy behind them thrusts XDXP.
I always wanted to visit Japan but not as a "fat westerner"  so I'm thinking once I drop 80lbs maybe I can visit, but now I'm worried about just visiting as a "westerner" in general.
My wife and I visited Japan just before the pandemi,c and it was the best holiday evel, except for the tourists we saw. Most of them weren't aware of the culture they were visiting and there were many embarrassing moments  - we all represent "the tourist" at the end of the day.  Then Covid happened and many people didn't want to share the responsibility. I'm from the UK and we were (and still are) probably the worst country dealing with the pandemic, from top to bottom. Every summer, we wanted to plan a trip again but due to that selfish behaviour, people kept spreading the virus even harder. Some people we know of said that the whole thing is a lie and they refused to be vaccinated. It makes it quite hard to respect that decision since it affects you and everyone else in a long run.   Fast forward to the present time, we are nagging about how strict is Japan, why they don't want tourists over and so on. Even if it makes us very sad to not be able to visit Japan soon, I completely understand and agree with that decision. And I'm not sure why would anyone want to visit a place where they are not very welcome.  In short; I hope this will be a good lesson for us as tourists (it won't) and we will be respectful to each other and to the places we visit (we won't) and we all have a jolly good time!
Would Love to see Abroad in Japan Muppet Christmas Carol!! Connor can play the rat 😉🐀
Your cinematography is a amazing!! I love seeing each shot you do!! It’s honestly a big part of why I enjoy you videos so much!! 🤩
Nice video! It's given me a little extra motivation to get my health in order as well. Good luck to the both of us I guess!
Japan is always looking for an excuse to close itself from the world. Unfortunately xenophobia is a huge aspect of Japanese culture
i can't wait to go on my guided tour to see only akihabara and get sent home!!!
My friends and I are hoping to visit in October, we contacted our Japan Travel Bureau, Japan Travel Service and then a travel agency we found on google located in Japan. Not one of them could tell us how or what we would need to book (they even had no idea what agency we would have to even go thorough) and to check back after the 7th. So still no way to book a trip as of now. Fingers crossed there will be someway we can do it soon.
Why are you always on the customer side of your ramen shop?
Does montage indicate creator clash? :)
abroad in japan xmas carol pls make it i need it in my life common common
its obviously because foreigners are filthy 🤣  cant wait to see a really buff Chris in a few months, it will for sure motivate a lot of people
"I have a hard time praising things" Englishman in Japan must truly be the struggle
9:20 just out of context
To visit that abandoned building, could you hire a guide with a bear gun to come with you?
DO IT!!
Do it! (You´ll be excused);)
I enjoy the cinematography even if 95% of other people don't Chris, keep it up.
Chris I like your videos but if I were Sharla I'd feel very insulted and hurt and possibly dump your ass.
yes - please do the christmas carol
Is it still “abroad” after 10 years though?
Super lay tives?   Not superla tives?
"Reasonably priced hitman." lolololol. Entertaining video as always, thank you for sharing!
OMG YES!!! DO THE CHRISTMAS Thing!!!
September 7th it does look like an easier arrival process. No expensive test results needed.
Yes Abroad in Japan Christmas Carol! Please do this!   I also love the muppets version :)
13:34 O_O the dark timeline is being realized! Dark Chris lives!
Christmas Carol! Christmas Carol! 👏👏👏
Why Chris be ripping off Get Lucky like that?
Did not expect Junk Food Japan to be seen here. Looking forward to more collabs, his channel is great!
Yes, please, please do Abroad in Japan, A Christmas Carol!
I love this type of video. Especially when fuelled by free sake! Yay! 😁 A mediocre You Tuber? With 2.71 million subscribers.
Japan - No foreigners! Perry - Hold my black ships.
God I hate the influencer word
Would you consider doing a travel series across other counties? Abroad Tour of China, Korea, Thailand etc?
Muppet Christmas Carol 100% the best version. Glad you agree.
person: my son has a wants to do youtube :)  chris: give up on your dreams
Tuned in expecting a 25 minute video about foreigners still being banned. Instead I got a Q&A. A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one.
Ah, what a shame. I would have loved to know the meaning of life. I guess people don't ask these kinds of questions because they don't want to put a damper on your upbeat content. But please do talk about these topics. They're important.
I booked a trip to Japan for 2 weeks next year through the travel agency EF Ultimate Break (cause I hate planning and booking things lol) and I was wondering this whole time if it would even go through since I know Japan still forbid tourists. So I'm glad to hear that guided tours are allowed since that's what mine is gonna be. Though we do have "free days" on our trip that allow us to do whatever we around the city we're in so I'm wondering if that will be allowed since its not led by a guide lol
As an aging weeb, I've wanted to go to Japan for most of my life. But I've never had the money to do the trip - came from a very poor family, and remained poor as an adult. Now, in my 30s, I finally have enough money saved for the trip I've been dreaming of for 20 years... and I'm not allowed to go.
Ayyyy, can't wait for the swole Chris arc! Let's all get fit and swole together. I'm returning to the gym later this evening.
Yes to Christmas Carols!
Congrats on 10years!!!!
I love the van scene.  This to me is the Japanese version of Bald and Bankrupt :)
I love the torii on top of the rock! looks like a candle on top of a cake.
Congratulations on the 10th anniversary, all these years were a blast. I would love to watch a series co-hosted by American Pete and you definitely should invite him more to the podcast. Cheers from Brazil!
thank you for Explaining the clickbait titles, i understand now. But personally i try and avoid clickbait at all costs
Christmass carol or unsub?
JAPAN HAS REOPENED TO TOURISTS  WITHOUT TOUR GUIDES
As for exercise. I recommend BeachBody's Insanity series. It's 2 months of hell at a time but it gets the job done. I recommend it over just bicycling which will burn calories but not do much else in terms of strengthening. Your goofy sidekick guy who you have tied up in your truck would probably be a good person for fitness advice.
Chris just answer the fucking question on how to get started being a YouTuber. XD  I love you man but that answer is going to get nothing but a blank and frustrated expression from a child.
Why are you drinking out of my Year 7 Woodcraft project?
Chris, I'm so happy to hear you're taking your health & wellbeing into consideration! I turned 35 this year and it really does sneak up on you...From someone who is also working on bettering theirself, best of luck to you! I know you can do it. :)  PS That drawing of you is funny, I've seen you show it off before, but you are nowhere near that size! Hope you don't ever let it drag you down. <3
If you're serious about doing the Christmas special I'm all in😁🎄❤! Maybe Sharla and you!?! I watch her channel too
You will do great things Chris, Netflix and beyond! Give it time and enjoy your the journey. Definitely do something with Christmas theme. After 2 very difficult years, we definitely need to dive back in the atmosphere again.
Ummm Abroad in A Pan is pretty dope as a fun random every once in a while. Maybe when you go back to the UK you can do a thing to sit with a UK/Japan fusion restaurant owner? I feel like your Sushi video did well when you visited your friend's sushi restaurant, so that could be a cool thing! :D
YOUR VIDEOS ARE RADICAL. Getting a ton of hate on the internet is probably AIDS but just be glad you're not the sad person on the internet telling people they're "mediocre." Keep on being awesome
sad thing is i planned to go to japan in 2020, had everything ready and was about to buy the stuff but i heard that the Olympics were happening too, so decided to push it back.  then of course covid happened. I dont have the money to do plane tickets and guided tours nor do i have the desire to have a very restrictive guided tour tbh.  So until all this nonsense is over or some act of god grants me to go,  I probably will just abandon my dream of going.
could bearly believe my ears hearing abroad in japans bear puns
Chris, would you ever do a Paranormal across Japan?
Here is your excuse to do it!
Chris you mentioned philosophy as something you’d want to be asked.  So is there a quote that you use to help motivate you in making videos or how you want to be seen in Japan 🇯🇵 maybe even stoic.  I love your videos and hope to see Japan open before years end too. 😁
I vote A Christmas Carol with a Dr. Jelly cameo.
LOL - The 80s montage. Did you just pay a guy to beat you up and abuse you?    Please be careful Chris.
Ah yes. Another dose of quality content. Better than heroin
I mean… I just moved to the Aomori prefecture and I’m a foreigner so idk lol
I'd be totally up for an Abroad in Japan Christmas Carol!
it would be hilarious if the 3 ghost were the trash taste guys
Yes, Yes we would like like to see Abroad in Japan a Christmas Carol.
Poor Sharla, I feel like that backfired a bit 😂😂
I would love to see an aborad in japan christmas carol
Bad Father! That girl is perfectly normal and pretty! The question is how drunk would you have to get Elon Musk to steal his precious bodily fluids and would Dr. Jelly be mad scientist enough to do the ex-vitero nutrient tank technique? GoFundMe project, anyone? 🤔😁
Aloha 🌺 Chris! Congratulations 10 years! Amazing! Thank you! Aloha 🌺
Appreciate the great content and honest updates. Support you getting healthy. Trying to do that myself!
13:40 😂Connor has the second day’s outfit!  No wonder Chris took soo long in the car😂
I think the reason that the Japanese government is still limiting tourism is because they know that tourists, especially Americans, can't be trusted to abide by masking and quarantine policies unless they have a babysitter. I obviously don't mean everyone, but I do believe that there is a significant portion of American tourists that would say they would follow the rules right up until they are actually in Japan and then throw those rules out the window as soon as they think they're not going to get thrown right back on the plane.
How about a sake box recommendation/ discount code that delivers to the UK?
Happy 10th!
for the viewer the shots you take we appricate them as much as you because we arent there but for the people with you there experiencing it, so its good you have that vision or perpective to begin with. also i wondered why the last series wasnt call journey across japan i didnt think it was it until i watched. pity about click bate for some of us its dosnt make sense
I’m surprised you didn’t mention that the Japanese Embassy in London has shut down business visa appointment booking due to lack of capacity and a poor booking system.
"Yes please! Do it again! In my mouth!" - Chris Broad, 2022
It is so sad that Japan is pushing alcohol to the young. Gosh the effects of Alcoholism will be much worse that the loss of revenue.
mate that clip where you say "sugoi" in the reaction window to you eating potato chips always cracks me up
Damn. No way Chris is preparing to fight KSI in a boxing match for the Influencer Boxing Championship
just want you to know i cannot appreciate those shots enough, theyre so beautiful and i wish you could make a video purely of all of the drone footage you have
yes to a christmas carol in japan
No shoutout to the Junk Food Japan Gym, even though you have Nicholas on screen? Aww, poor guy... nice to see him in action, helping you become less of a literal J-vlogger Behemoth, though. 👍 Would love to see a collab.
A Soapland is like a very clean massage parlor and love hotel but without any beds.
Your daughter's cute, too bad Elon took custody.
None gonna ask?? What happens next to conner? This would be a funny skit if u carried on and randomly put them in random videos.
Chris! Your videos are always enjoyable, and always make me laugh. Your adventures are fun to watch. Thanks for the great content and great cinematography. Congrats on 10  years! Keep it up man. Good luck with your training and health goals. I've been through the same challenges and thought process of what I am going to be like in my 30's. It will be worth all the hard work.
Wait did Chris get scouted for the next creator clash?
Oishi!
Wait... how are people reporting ghost activity in an abandoned building that's too unsafe to go inside unless people are going inside?
You can already see you e been putting in work lately.
The part about ..no one appreciating the shots you take for your videos...not truee!! I love them!!! Really beautiful stuff
9:26 Sharla, clip that. Use it when he least expects it. There's your revenge.
Not to sound stupid, but do you think it's surprising that you still have a thick British accent after living in Japan for so many years?
The reason they don't let tourists in anymore is incase your twin brother Piss Broad decides he wants to follow you. One is already too many 😭
cant watch anymore, too skinny , doesn't cover enough of the screen lol.
Go Bruins!!!!!!
9:26 huh???
I had a look at jy 30 year old self in the mirror beginning of this year and decided to make a change. Jogging, pull up and yoga. Ive lost 10 kgs so far! Keep pushing and working out. Its all worth it in the end and an extremely rewarding experience!
This is your excuse to make a Christmas Carol
Eiii, it's Junk Food Japan! Nice to see you're training under him mate!
I'm glad you took my advice. Concentrate on becoming a Karate Black Belt and becoming good at Karate not on 'getting fit' ...trust me, the fitness will come. It will be a hard tough road but you will become fighting fit Chris-San.
Looking forward to Aboard in Japan  Christmas carol with Dr Jelly!😂
Japanese society puts a stronger emphasis upon courtesy than upon honesty. Therefore, there is a certain amount of deceit built into relationships.
I had planned to travel to Japan next year (originally this year until the world kept going on pause) but have decided to visit Korea first. I feel like right now even if they open up to tourists at the end of the year there is still that risk of things changing again by fall 2023.
Okay, we need now a  1 Hour 1980's style workout montage, 😉. Thx for your video´s .
were you actually hitman when your younger?
Not looking good, not feeling good and not feeling good about myself, save that for your forties. he he he
Chris I just want to say you look great! Skin is glowing, and you emit a very confident energy through the screen, also loving the journey across Japan episodes, have been looking forward to it
I don’t mind an Abroad In Japan Christmas Special. I say go for it man.
Yes to Abroad in Japan Chris-mas Carol
9:23 sus
Everybody hates Chris
I love the fitness montage at the end!
"Yes please do it again, in my mouth"💀
That is so stupid, do they really think Covid cares about race?
Refference - Inside Japans 3000 private tropical vila: Okinawa - Abroad in Japan  Hi Chris,  I clicked on this video because of the blue water matching the cream yellow vila and green bushes pairing with your red highlights.  For me i click on thumbnails with good colour compositions, it just so happens your pale body(no offense im irish, my ancestors ancient melanin stores were fecked off to the wind ages ago)  pairs with the red highlights and stands out from the colours behind it.  Additionally the white outline around your body helps too.   I think click rate has more to do with these factors rather than your face.   All the best, Subscriber James
I'm so glad Chris you plan to put your health first! Just remember, people will always judge you no matter what you do. The most important thing is how you feel about yourself and how you feel in your own body 🙏✨️
Thoughts on Government House Utilitarianism?
Thanks!
I love how you so honestly spoke about health and not being ready for opportunities ahead... many of us feel that way and are working on ourselves too! Thank you Chris!
6:27 looks like a real person
i need a "EAT YOUR SALMON" shirt
YES ABSOLUTELY DO CHRISTMAS CAROL! Please!
Good as always. I’m planning to get fit this year too with a view to being able to travel to Japan once it properly opens up to tourist - without the crappy tour guide
Let's wait for Sharla's unpublished photographs of Chris.
You may hate the fact that people want to be influencers, though the sad fact is that’s what brands want. Being in the creative industry and apart of those meetings, companies are constantly strategizing around marketing influencers around their audience wether it’s a creative influencer or just a normal influencer. It’s currently the way the market is now to be successful you need a following
Will Sharla let you live after that picture?
A CHRISTMAS CAROL! DO IT! Also on a side note, if you ruin A Christmas Carol for me I will hate you forever. ;)
Brown bears, there's Grizzly there ? .. just little black bear 🐻  lol 😆
I was saving money planning to visit Japan for my first time ever in 2021 (was planning since 2018). Your bike ride across Japan actually inspired me to really want to visit, and I'm still holding out hope that I will make it to Japan for my first time before the end of this decade.
I'll get fit with you, Chris! I'm working on myself more than ever now as well. Let's do our best!
You shouldn't put ice on. It slows the regeneration.
7:45 Sounds like toxic positivity 😥
"Yes please, do it again, in my mouth!"
I would watch Abroad in a Pan lmao
Loved this , good to have Q&A video again , sad that jpn is still closed , would love to visit it some day.
OH!!NO!!
Do you know what else would help boost the Japanese alcohol industry?   Tourism lol  Seriously tho, cases are not going down, and japanese travelers are able to move freely in and out. They can't use the excuse that it's foreigners' fault anymore. And after years and years of tourism revenue practically disappearing, they are bound to resent it economically one way or another. Money is leaving with japanese travelers but very little money is entering with foreign visitors. I know Japan is not very good at trying new things and stuff but... come on. What made them think people in general like north korea-style guided tours where you can't even go to the conbini downstairs?
The problem is not knowing "where to start" on your booze...but when to stop. Hey bro you drunk and fat....and an excellent YouTuber. Cheers mate.
if they want ppl to drink more alcohol they should open the borders and invite the Irish ..
The best excuse for you to do anything (like your version of the Christmas Carol) is because you want to.  What other excuse is there?
The boxing was cool man. I hate working out, but love training martial arts, so that keeps me very fit! I highly recommend it. Boxing/kickboxing/muy thai/jiu jitsu are all great. Find the one you like best
I wonder if there are any videos about Japan that Chris wanted to do but is afraid to do just because Chris is afraid that Youtube might remove them because of there ridiculous YouTube guidelines?
"Do it again...in my mouth"....holy shit, dude 🙈🤣
Strange thing is those click bait titles is why I haven’t watched them. If I would have known it was a journey across Japan video I would have watched it without a second thought
Good on you for keeping healthy, best of luck with that! 👊
What are your thoughts on death? Do you fear it, embrace it? You better answer this question you "affable" man
Quick tip for the weight thing: Excercise alone won't do it. Watch your calorie input/output. A bunch of fried stuff will easily counter some workout.
Lol. These stupid old men in Japanese government keep thinking of useless shit like telling people to drink so the economy gets better. People drinking a lot is a byproduct of a good economy. Not the other way around.
Love you Chris! But seriously...its very tempting not to write bad comments just to see you react to them! haha!
Chris at the next influencer boxing event confirmed hmmmm?
We are so looking forward to our trip next April, please Japan open up next year. It will be my 3rd visit but I really want to show my wife how beautiful the country is during sakura.
Loved that montage! Very inspiring, really! (no sarcasm here, it really made me want to exercise)
Can we please rally to get Chris to do some sort of interaction with bears because this bear obsession is getting out of control. Face your fears, man!!!
Yesss the Muppet Christmas Carol is the best
I hate A Christmas Carol. Talk about cliche. Borrrr-ing.
So Chris started boxing (with Junk Food Japan!). Next week we have KSI vs. Chris Broad or what?
Charlotte is going to kill u
Click Abroad : Japan bait
This is one of my favorite AiJ videos.
13:40 is it a killer chris refrence?
"yes please do it again in my mouth" - Chris 2022
"I think there is a assumption because I do put a lot of effort into production quality on Abroad in Japan that I wanna be making stuff for Netflix or the BBC and it's true I do."  Its been 5 minutes. I am still laughing about this. had to rewind the video because I couldnt pay attention to anything after that for a while.
wish japan will open the border soon...i've bought a plane ticket for the midle of november this year.... i want to visit places that you visited in your chanel chriss...really inspired...😘
Please make the Abroad in Japan Christmas Carol
Dave will be sleeping on the couch after that Sharla picture for a few weeks lmao
Make a child with elon RN😤
Your opening shots always turn out great! Those really set the scenes well for your videos.
I would love to see a version of a Christmas carol with all your friends as different characters. I wanna see Ghost of Christmas Past Natsuki.
16:10 Chris for creator clash?
Wow, I can't believe this small-time no-name YouTuber managed to get THE Junk Food Japan to do a cameo at the end of his video! Amazing! ;)
I appreciate your stunning drone shots chris
Just let them die out, they seem to be ok with it. their birth rate are getting so low while death rates are on the rise.
At this rate ill have enough saved up to live there for 4 months. Jeeez
That skit with connor in the bike van was absolutely priceless 🤣🤣🤣
Japan 🇯🇵
I'm really glad to see alot of youtubers talk about this. I hope the country takes note and make changes.
Chris on a YouTube boxing card would be a madness
YESS I want to see that Christmas Carol special!!!  Especially if Natsuki and the other Abroad in Japan regulars are in it!
That end montage…. Does this mean Abroad in Japan vs Jake Paul is confirmed??? 🤣
Of course boyfriends famously take and only share bad pictures of their girlfriends lmfao!! Do better Chris lol!
I need you to understand. You look like the love child of Ricky Gervais and Elon Musk.
I'd watch abroad in a pan... Chris barging into Connor's unused kitchen and ruining it for it's maiden voyage? gold.
japan secretly enters another 200 years of sakoku
Glad to see you're improving physical and mental health, I have my mandatory military service in half a year so i'll be working out along with you!💪
CHRIS! Please please please make a Christmas Carol abroad in Japan style!! That would be so marvelous and if you started now, you could create something so sassy, warming, and memorable. Congrats on 10 years btw!
Something outside YouTube would be great for the 60% not for the algorithm 🤔
Why do ppl always have to hate on somebody else. How do you even have the energy for that?
Yeah after looking up how big those bears can get... you don't want to mess with them... I thought they maybe were like the northeastern American brown bread where they are small-ish.. don't want to mess with them but your still kinda ok.. Also I want to say the video quality of these videos is what keeps me coming back weather it's drone shots or Connor on the roof top. It's great camera work and gives me the feeling of being there.
I thought when you were asked to show some pics that you never had before it was from Sharla.   And then the first pic you showed was of Sharla!
YES do it!
Because xenophobia. It's not complicated.
those bears arent that big, you should go to yellowstone park ;)
My honeymoon flights to Japan in October were cancelled in August. Our original trip in May 2020 was cancelled for obvious reasons. Now we're going to Vietnam instead of Japan in October but hope to visit next year. Real shame- had my Japan holiday itinerary since 2019 :/
the mount fuji comment got me pretty bad 🤣
Thank you Chris for going into a little in depth on the foreign tourists issue with Japan at the moment.  Too often do I see people  jump on the opportunity to bash on the country and say that "Japan doesn't want foreigners", and though there is SOME truth to that statement, I think it's important to acknowledge that it's not that clear cut and that many actually want them back.
Maybe next April then ...
likes abandoned buildings that are actually abandoned.... As he stares at Connor
Honestly Chris should do exercise videos with Natsuki and friends. I'd watch it.
christmascarrol thank you! would watch!
Chris,  Do you think that objective truth should be our goal in life or that we should settle for, and enjoy our subjective realities?
I would watch Abroad in a Pan.... Damn you youtube.....
Where's commodore Perry when you need one?
While living in Japan, the home of karate and judo, Chris finds the only other non-Japanese person to train him. lol (all jokes aside, well done on making your health a priority. It will likely benefit your mental health as well.) Enjoy the workouts!
kudos on taking your health seriously, heres to another 10 years of Abroad in Japan. Cheers Chris !
Is this a sneaky hint that you're getting yourself into the world of Internet celebrity boxing
Another fun video! I myself finally got into the Tokyo Marathon for 2023, but as someone who has visited Japan a few times, the idea of being babysat is a deal breaker. Hopefully, the restrictions will lift, and I'm more than willing to help make up the 3% of lost revenue from drinking (in moderation, of course) ;)
Sharla's picture was so unexpected, it got me laughing for a solid minute.
I'd absolutely love to go to Japan in the future. I've fallen in love with the culture and want to learn more. Thank you for putting out content. Happy ten years! 🎉
“what better way to celebrate than doing a Q&A.” I don’t know… Maybe a nice dinner and some beers with good friends? Just a thought…
good luck on getting thin lol
Proud of ya Chris, great job trying so well to find a goal, a purpose and a challenge, to keep your life and yourself both entertained, excited and bright! I know i went through a massive depression in my early 20s with dead family, dead pets, a dead end with my job, but bringing yourself to try something new, to try and find a passion and goal, that was worth so much more! Best of luck with the ongoing bike-trip and i am looking forward to see how you progress and manage your health!
Not really how you pronounce superlative. It's more like SU-perlative rather than super-lative.
Congrats on 10 years! Super psyched to watch you get super fit and go an exciting, physically taxing, psychologically torturous adventures!
I said back in late 2020 that Japan was gonna handle covid poorly... Everyone had this dumb idea that you could somehow hide from a contagious virus... All they have done is super slowly pull off the bandaid that had to come off one way or another. Its one if the downsides of Japans overly communal culture.
Yay!!! I’m helping the gover… mmmeeeennnnn 🤮 nt!!!!!!!   “Thank you” from the Japanese government.  Is how that would play out in England if that advice would be given here.  Imagine the carnage that would cause.  To possibly become a super star on the aboard in Japan channel I must add a insult… hhhuummm you just is looking very Kim Jong-Um right now Chris, well done, good work.  Love and admire you and still one channel I never get bored of or even grow out of.  Very… (think of awkward words to describe it..) relaxingly lightly rich.
Fun fact - I'm more likely to click on a "duller" thumbnail with a less clickbaity title, than the clickbaity one. What I mean is I'm now going to watch the video of the private villa, because it instantly became more interesting to me when you said you'd prefer it to be called just Day 2 of Journey Across Japan or whatever it was you said, something like that. I know I must in the minority with this preference of mine, since all youtubers say so, but I'm just so full of people trying to sell me all kinds of spectacles and super exciting extravaganzas in youtube, when what I really want is just well made content from people who have proven to be very likeable to my taste.  I hate over the top hulabaloo kinda things in general 🤷
How do the enlightenment philosophers compare to popular Japanese philosophers of the same time?
The ending of this rocky montage is the most Chris broad way to end it. Absolutely perfect
As a 30 year old failed youtuber who is reeling from his own health check, I appreciate you, sir and hope you can inspire me to get healthier. The karaage though... it's a constant struggle.
14:42 Chris said this but you see him on Connor's stream that he ate so many energy jelly and lavish meals
Would you do a video on death in Japan? I feel like the differences would be very interesting to see. I recently lost someone close to me and in the US it's almost rushed and seen as something to just move past. What are the traditions in Japan? Have you gone to a Japanese funeral?
Omg an abroad in Japan Christmas Carol would be amazing ❤️
I would totally watch abroad in a pan cooking show!
"Twatty clickbait titles".  congrats Chris, you just summed up Youtube's algorithm in three words  LOL
Chris. Hit the gym!! Getting muscles is the quickest and healthiest way to lose fat!! Combine that with a dose of 2hrs/week aerobics (like most of what you are already doing) and you are good to go.
“Do it again in my mouth” Chris?
Japan complaining about tourists is like a restaurant complaining about having "too many customers" and making lots of money.  Smart people already know, you don't get money from tourists when you ban their entry into your country.  So, to those companies and towns in Japan going broke from lack of tourist money, enjoy your struggle because it is what you asked for.   🙄
I'm gonna hold you to the "end of the year opening up to tourists" thing because I am desperate to get over to Japan for a few weeks by March next year lol. I was supposed to study over there for a year from this month but I'm unfortunately too unwell to travel right now so I had to cancel the whole thing and switch my degree D: needless to say I want to go on holiday visit all my friends on my course who are over there asap!! In the meantime I'm enjoying experiencing Japan vicariously through all of your videos, so thank you for all that you do and letting me see Japan from my bed :D
Looking forward to your take on the Christmas Carol!
Screw those comments at the beginning! Chris is actually the most unique-lookin men that I've seen have residence in Japan. Like, Chris doesn't at all like a creepy, self-centered weeb. More like, a creepy, self-centered brit. jk LOL
Just the montage is worth at least a like
Just a little bit of an advice. Don't have to take it if you don't want to everybody trains differently. Pivot your body more when you punch, and use your shoulder to extend your punch rather than moving your body forward. Especially the right cross on your one-two, but good effort keep it up.
I take that culture positively and I do admire how they put the other's feeling first. When saying a little praise and it doesn't hurt me in anyway, I'm totally fine with that.
That was great fun!
This government is the most disgusting bunch of dirty old men on planet earth.
"You boy, what day is it?' "It's Christmas sir." "Take this money and go to KFC. Get me the biggest bucket you can find!"
karate kid arc. ok
But why would I go alone to a country where I don't speak the native language, nobody in the country speaks my native language and where everything is written in entirely different symbols? Wouldn't I be much better served with a guide / minder?
Its Crazy to think i started watching you 6 years ago. Congrats on 10 amazing years!
Japan will lose far more than than elderly voters if they don't open to tourism dollars. The economy is crashing far more than the most other developed countries. More importantly they lose respect by closing their doors akin to North Korea.
Taken for Granted when?
I did like the unbearable joke. Bad but good!!!😂
A Christmas Carol Abroad! Oh yeah. Absolutely. Do it!
No way Japan is encouraging alcoholism to its youth and you're out here doing an ad for alcohol 💀
We're waiting for more then two years now. I want to explore Japan in my own. But it seems that won't be possible in the future. Its almost like in North Korea, where tourists only allowed in groups with one person from the government.
How selfish can you get before you realise oh shit, something wrong is going on, maybe we should try to correct it with even more selfish rules? No wonder these Young people are selfish themselves. They learnt from their elders.
There's no legitimate reason for the tourism ban. And yes, I realize that "guided tours" and tours booked through tour agencies are "allowed," but in practice, tourism is still banned. They've got no issue with Japanese tourists going wherever they please internationally with no restrictions, which absolutely kills their reasoning for stopping tourism.
"Yes please, do it again, in my mouth" - Chris 2022
“Yes please, do it again, in my mouth!”
Chris will you play Scrooge in a christmas carol?
What you gonna do when YouTube fucks off? Also, what’s the deal with your visa?
For the better part of 2020 and 2021,  most bars were closed and restaurants would not sell alcohol in the Tokyo metropolitan area. Business operation hours were also reduced. It's no secret why the liquor tax revenue dropped dramatically in FY2020. Anyway I've kept doing my personal effort on the alcohol consumption part, to support the economy.  😉
Alcohol sales dependant economy never ruined any country. Just look at Russia
I must say, your take about being a youtuber is really good. This message should be more spread out because I think it's what people are missing when they use the word "youtuber". I try personally to use it less and less and say "I saw a documentary", "this artist", "that anime reviewer", "That guy who plays x game".
Is this Chris (personal channel) first paid advertisement? And typical of Chris to endorse alcohol. LOL
Have you tried the kichi kichi omurice? I don't see you talk about omurice like ever....
So we need to wait for the old people to die  Dang those Japanese people  They live forever
@9:00  Reminds me of the movie The Joy Luck Club where the white guy says the dish needs salt.
Abroad in Japan Christmas Carol? Yes please!!!
What's that cafe like background he is in? Pretty nice vibe.
Literally the *day* after this video its been announced they're letting people in lmao.
I truly love this Arc of Chris and the people he's collaborating with.
when's the match with Drago Chris?
Honesty suits you.Good Q and A.
I notice you said superlatives as super latives, in Australia we say it su pearlatives.
damn actually amazing ifyou manage to keep up the training .. might also be inspiring to myself keeping up the regularity of going to the gym ^^ (though first imma have to look into the drinking) ^^
I missed the Q&A but I'll ask here anyway - would you ever do a documentary that follows a video from concept idea to finished product? How you come up with the idea, decide how to plan it, filming, editing, making a thumbnail, and then posting (and any promotion you have to do once it's up.) I think so many people are into the idea of becoming a "YouTuber" because they think it's easy work - film a video, edit it in an hour, put it up, and get paid. It'd be nice to see the reality from someone who truly does do this as their *job.*
Abroad in a Christmas Carol!!! lets go!!
You are genuinely the only Youtuber I have not stopped watching over the past 5 years over any period. I love each and every one of your videos, and because of them, I have fallen in love with Japanese culture.
Abroad in Belly
I'm really sad I can't see my fiancé :( due to the border restrictions we can't meet
Thanks for all the awesome and entertaining videos! The part about Japanese only praising was my highlight --  i love watching 腹ペコ!なでしこグルメ旅 and they always showed the food being SO DELICIOUS even though you see that they just swallowed half a bowl in 2 secs....  anyways also reminded me of this youtuber travelling around the word for food, recently so tired of as everything he had were "beyond his imagination, so delicious, never had that before"... 🤣🤣🤣
Always glad to see your passion on display! Whether it's about Japan or filmmaking, it's a joy to watch. P.s. love the new haircut!
23:30 WHY IS THIS SO FUNNY XDDDDDDDD
23:00 SUPER INTERESTING PERSPECTIVE Thank you so much Chris!
You got to land on Gunkanjima - very jealous - my boat turned back due to swells.
Sharla: “Well this awkward but now its over between us”. Lol.
Chris, you know what you should do? A CHRISTMAS CAROL MOVIE!!! Just - you know, as an idea...
10 days left till I arrive in Japan!! wohooo
How did you get Alan Davies to play you in the Christmas Carol? :O  Oh, where's that batconnor from? I've not seen every video here, admittedly.
🍺🥳🍺 10 Years!!!
Contratulations on the 10 years, I have watched you for many years. I got some ideas (even if you didn't ask for it) xD -Abroad in a Van (stealth camping around Japan) maybe with a guest. -Maybe somehing about volunteering in Japan or helping homeless would be interesting. -Maybe a carefully made documentary about adult entertainment, and similar, interviewing staff or managers of such places. -What about ways for foreigners to buy cheap property around tokyo (Akia or Black properties aka Jiko Bukken) -Maybe something about how to start a business in Japan.
25:35 The woman's expression!!!!!
When is the next journey across Japan I enjoy watching em
DOOOOOO IIIIIIIIT! I LOVE A Christmas Carol! It is one of my favorites! Doooooo eeeeeeeeet! DO IT DO IT DO IT!  Also, more puns! lol
I'm always shy to comment on (anything) your videos, but after seeing what kind of shit you get, hey, I guess mine couldn't be worse. Anyway I just wanted to say that your videos, which I've been watching for a  few years now, make me extremely happy, I know it's gonna be a good day whenever there is a notif coming from your channel, and before I get more cheesy, I'll wrap it up, thank you for your efforts!
15:00 FULL FOCUS ON PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH. I AM RIDING THAT BOAT 10000000000% Thank you Thank you Thank you so much for focusing on yourself. This is the content I want.
CHRISTMAS CAROL CHRISTMAS CAROL!! CHRIS MUST CAROL!!!!!
I LOVE Muppet Christmas Carol! Please please do this!! 😂😂😂😁😁
My big concern is that this isolationist policy will basically turn into a new Sakoku Edict (or Sakoku Decree, for us Genshin Impact fans), in all but name.  Frankly, as you said, it's frustrating that Japanese citizens get to travel the world, but won't allow foreigners into the country.  It is also equally frustrating that they export so much of their culture and cuisine, but are reluctant or outright refusing to let outside influences enter their own country.  But if Japan really wants to stand on the world stage as a prominent member of geopolitics, they can't keep catering to their elderly population for much longer.  More and more of their population is going to start dying off as they get older.  They need to start bringing younger generations to the negotiating table, and letting them take part in the political discussion.  And I'm talking about people in their mid to late-20s, roughly around the time people are eligible to run for office here in America.  I think a great example of the consequences of this ineffective approach of catering too much to the older generations can be seen in the 2016 movie Shin Godzilla (which, I recently learned, Sharla worked on as an English translator).  A bloated, aging government stuck in the past was unable to deal with an unprecedented crisis, and it resulted in the government basically being destroyed by Godzilla's atomic breath.  It took the younger generation of government officials with fresher ideas and didn't give much consideration to things like age and seniority (like so many of the older generations do) to save the day.  Basically, the people who do stand out, didn't follow the crowd, and spoke their mind freely.  To me, the message was that if Japan wants to survive and thrive, it needs to cater more to its' younger generations who may not necessarily share the outdated views and values of the older generations.  Ergo, they need to listen to the concerns that younger Japanese citizens have and properly address them, such as the rising costs of living, healthcare, childcare, being able to work in non-exploitative companies, and more equality for minorities (especially women, who are still basically treated as second-class citizens in the country, despite many of them being smarter than their male counterparts).  So far, doubling down on the failed policies of the past that got them to where they are now (an economic slump that has lasted for decades) will not get them out of the mess they're in.  Simply put, they need newer, fresher ideas from their younger generations in order to pull themselves out of their slump and truly became a world leader again.
Kichi kichi omurice!!!
What is the meaning of life?
Could you fly a drone into the abandoned school, for footage? Or would losing the drone be too much of a risk?
Japan opens and closes more than a fucking door
Lol I don't drink, it's not something that I see as a good habit to start. Also some people can't handle it well.
"Open the country. Stop having it be closed."
I doubt soapland 14:00 is a real place but if it was in Japan, it wouldn’t surprise me if it was a unique amusement park based on the other videos I’ve seen.
10 years! Holy Crap! Look at all you've accomplished, the friends you've made, and the community you've built! Way to go Chris!
Lol @ "look like every white guy that moves to Japan"
Chris what was that into you looked so high haha
“Yes please. Do it again. In my mouth” -Chris broad circa 2022. You doing okay friend?
So Chris is doing training now, since probably sharla pushed him.  We all know the struggle, with a girlfriend, mate.
Nice fade, man!
Connor being kidnapped made me giggle. Fun to see you combining old footage with almost fresh footage that must have been recorded a day or two ago during your trip with Connor!
I did get a bit of a physics vibe when you talked to Sharla kitty. It is written!
Japan better had open back up soon. They just announced the Pokemon World Championships is being held in Yokohama next year so it'd be a bit of a problem if the country was still closed to foreigners.
Click bait is only click bait if you don’t follow through. Chris exceeds expectations every time.
Please try to get a real job Chris, and make a video showcasing your progress.  2 birds with one stone 👍
I like that you got the former karate and k1 champion Nicholas Pettas as your coach 😄
Meanwhile in Europe since the Russian invasion war nobody  talk about covid, and tourist has increase a lot, now covid is something  minimal in Comparison with  the war bring for Europe
Honestly I would love to have an Abroad In Japan Christmas Carol, that'd be so entertaining.
BOXING IN JAPAN????
The end frame is priceless
I just entered Japan on tourist visa,so I’m sure we’re not banned lol
Over the last 15 years there have been numerous Youtubers that have gone on to start a TV show, and frankly from my perspective, yhey make one production and NEVER come back to youtube.  If their tv show or movie isnt THAT good and they don't get a 2nd chance, now they've alienated and abandoned their original audience and their dream of making it big is now dead and they very quickly burn out and leave for good.
I've been laghing for more than two minutes and I'm not even two minutes in the video yet. This guy is the best!
ABSOLUTELY do a Christmas Carol! Seeing you produce higher budget projects for something like Netflix and BBC would be amazing too (Your work on YouTube is already higher quality than most of what I see already).  I just hope that they collab with you more than just taking control away from you, and that you continue YouTube either way too.  Also, I love that you are working hard to get healthy.  Not that I'm losing sleep wondering if you are fit or anything, but I personally do enjoy watching videos that incorporate something health related (i.e. watching you bike across Japan).    I like to push myself and so I'm more inspired when I see that extra effort.  Makes videos have a sense of growth mixed in.  Also also, hearing you bring up questions you are never asked involving things like philosophy, would you ever do some videos about just that and/or favorite books or anything?  I get it would probably not do as well, but maybe if they had less editing and if they were on your other channel... idk, I'm interested myself is all lol.
"Open the country. Stop having it be closed."
That’s soo messed up lol
a japanese christmas carol with all the characters being your friends and fellow creators would be amazing... maybe amazingly horrific... but still amazing
Nobody enjoys your shots? They're super duper sugoi  ;) .  I enjoy your videos because they bring me into your world. Done very tastefully, maybe even done.... tasty? oishii to the max
I see you're training to beat up Connor, nice editing in the last bit.
Omg plz do AiJCC!!!
An Abroad Carol would be incredible
Do a video on walking across Japan, I will join together with you ;)
#freeconnor
Hmmm. Interesting.  Isn't Japan letting in a certain amount of tourists though? Looking at the situation from my end, I was able to book a hotel without any problems and being from a blue-coded country, I'm exempt from quarantine. I fast-tracked with the MySOS and I didn't see anything about having to book a guided tour in any of the official websites I looked at.  I'm not second-guessing Chris, but I'm just confused.
Is it just me or Chris' daughter with Elon Musk looks like Chloe Grace Moretz?
I can aleady see progress on your weight loss since a couple weeks ago. It has inspired me to look at my health as well. Gotaa shed that pandemic weight.
To help weight loss do NOT live on energy gels. High sugar intake is awful. Eat proper food, concentrate on high nutritional value ,esp veg. Enjoy the cycle, the vlogs are awesome
🎵 We're gonna make a montageeee, even Rocky had a montageeeee 🎵
still one of the best channels on yt atm
Yes please, make A Christmas Carol! How do I contribute to this movie production?!
I live in canada in beautiful cottage country and can very much relate to the locals of Kyoto. In the summer here it gets very crowded with cottages tourists that seem to think they own the dang place! Most of us locals hate most of them, but at the same time they provide a LOT of money to the local economy and without them, many of our local business have, and will close down. Very much a love hate relationship.
Looking forward to see you ripped 😄👍
Abroad in Japan: A Christmas Carol should have a subplot of the Tiny Tim equivalent dreaming about getting KFC for Christmas.
If japan would open the borders i would Drink alcohol for 5 people there.
I would love to watch Abroad in a Pan!!!
Only pretentious people like us can understand cinematic shots. Keep them coming!
That's a nice fade bro!! Took off some years of you.
I will drink out of a wood box only when I've finished my time machine.
Natsuki as Ebenezer Scrooge? Yes please
Thanks so much Chris for this brilliant motivation. Im 30 and a little more round then i would like to admit, thanks to you I have just finished a 52km hike with a 20kg bag up some of the biggest mountains ive ever seen. my 30s are also going to be a turn around
Journey across japan was only 2 episodes?
Is...Is Chris preparing himself for the next Creator Clash?
Connor doing voice over? Please, the porn industry needs him.
damn if you keep it up I will stop calling you fat in japan. Good job on starting your fitness journey dont give up
Woah Chris Broad on MS X DAZN series 03 lesgoooo
Do the Christmas carol, I also wld love if u did cyberpunk shorts
Ten years? Now you have youtube tenure!
Chris, do the christmas carol thing!
Happy 10 Year Anniversary!  Abroad in Japan: A Christmas Carol sounds like a blast, please do it, and have Mariah Carey's 'All I want for Christmas' slowly get louder and louder in the background throughout... She's awakening...
Yes please produce your version of a christmas carol! You can almost keep the title from the best version, just call it "A muppets christmas carol".  In all seriousness, do it. Love your work!
I actually was a bit confused when I didn't see the title 'Journey Across Japan'. I didn't know what to look for. At least I figured it out
FYI, "superlative" is stressed on the second syllable: suu-PER-lative
As someone that was 32 and had the same revelation, who is now 40, you can do it! It takes work and effort, but when the results come, you'll be further inspired.
Make that Christmas Carol, man, that would be awesome!
You have been a great inspiration to me for years Chris! Keep it up! As a fellow mount Fuji bell man, you have inspired me to get fit and improve my health. I now do 30-60 minutes of swimming a day for 5 days and I feel I've should of done this years ago. 🙃
I didn't even realise this dropped today, I thought this was one I just missed, ery gud as always
Students thankfully are allowed to study in Japan right now so if you're interested in a study abroad, dont miss out on Japan!
Please make a Christmas Carol
Fit in Japan…….. Coming soon!
This video was great! My one critique, though, is the jump rope technique. You’ll find it a bit easier to keep pace if you hold the handles towards the ends and try and jump as little as possible. Learning the boxer bounce technique will also help with rhythm. I was just in your spot a year and a half ago and that’s one of many things I’ve learned. Good luck on your journey.
Your trainer kinda looks like John McAfee
9:26 🔞
What about people who are just on vacation in japan?
I'd love to see your cooking show, you can make another channel for that where you do all the stuff you want without thinking about yt, I'm pretty sure many of your viewers would watch it
super-lative - X suPERlative - O Sorry, Chris, I can't help myself. Love your work.
you are looking trimmer Chris keep it up 👍 love the content!
I think government officials are desperately trying to steer economic growth toward what they view as stable, long term, domestic growth sources and rely less on tourism, which depends on a lot of factors they have no control over. Encouraging young people to consume, have kids, get married and stay in the country is central to that. The pandemic represented an excuse to try and bump things in that direction.
One wrong way and connors gonna be bear food
You look fabulous! Quite trippy to see such a different look to you today when I just watched you floating about on a hamburger on JAJ episode 2 yesterday. Also, awesome 80s workout montage, the awkward thing was me literally getting a call from my local gym reminding me to pop in while watching you getting punched in the face. At least your montage kinda inspired me to actually go rather than being awkwardly guilted into going 😂 I'm 31 this year and I guess true, I would also like to get my health in check before I blink and turned 40. Ah, congratulations on 10 years as well! Such a long way from that video you made showing off your first apartment. Can't believe it's been 10 years! Great fun to be watching you ever since! Much love, stay healthy, stay inspired Chris.
Japan is facing an entire financial crisis and entire regions who rely on tourism are going bancrupt and they sitll dont want tourists to enter their country.. lmao.
Great point about being a videographer not an influencer.
I've been subbed to this channel since the early days and I've only just realised that Abroad in Japan is a play on Chris's surname Broad. As he is a Broad in Japan but also Abroad in Japan.   Genius !
Do take into account that most of the people like that (without a brain) are Logan Paul and the Tate fans, and that should tell you a lot.
WE WANT THE CHRISTMAS CAROL!!!!!!
That Sharla pic 😂
15:40 / 25:53
9:25 Chris: Yes, please, do it again, in my mouth.
Happy for you and your health goals. Don't forget to build some muscle as well. Too much cardio can still lead to that 'skinny fat' look that can discourage in the long run.
Was a bit concerned with your planned 700 km bike ride , certainly not for the faint hearted :-)      Glad to see you are in the gym .  Until I was 18 was always on a bike .  Was fit then .   F Fwd 43 years , went to a local island just off the coast of Auckland , my mate said get a bike , meaning motor bike .   Was a disaster , not a flat place at all , easy to go down , then up the other side and knowing you will have to do the same on the return .      How will you get back ?  Assume you have the route planned and pretty much organised , based on riding 'so far ' each day .    Am looking foward to your trip :-)
Hmm, something about seeing Chris workout. One rarely sees such a serious face on him. Inspiring
If you want to get fit maybe you should do one of those Geowizard Style Straight Line Missions across Japan.
I got fit when I turned 32, never looked back and it was the best decision I ever made. I'm 43 and haven't aged much.
21:37 sneaky reference 😂
Hey Chris I’m about to apply for a teaching position in Japan are there any tips or advice you can give for the application and transitioning process
Well done for getting into training. It is a big big step.
congrats
Thank you for your videos. I've always wanted to visit Japan, but I don't want to perpetuate the stereotype of the obese idiot westerner. It would also be difficult to find proper food in Japan, as my diet is very specific due to my medical condition. I must drink 2 liter Mountain Gold (equal parts mountain dew and processed nacho cheese) but travel with large quantities of liquid is overly prohibitive.
Love to see a programme on the Pandora's Box that is Japan's Metal and Rock music scene. There are some amazing musically brilliant all-female bands, like Band-Maid (THE best Rock band on Earth), Babymetal, Nemophila, Lovebites and many others. Also Ningen Isu (all male), a Rock/Metal trio that have been playing for nearly 30 years. Or the amazing F,M,M Prog Rock/Metal trio, Asterism.
Cheering you on to getting healthy! :D Great video! Congrats on the 10 years! Whooo!
Isn't the Mt Fuji one a compliment, i mean it's not visible one most occasions :D
Chris. Is the "You will be savaged by bears" your photo? I'd like to ask your permission to use it for something.
Someone should apply the Rhythm Heaven music to the fitness montage
Simply you just talking and giving information is better than most Japanese talk shows.  Wonderful content as always sir!  Ignore the haters... they are just an itty-bitty teeny-tiny minority here. ;)
It's funny how Japan went from being progressive to being super conservative to their own detriment. They're going to be a third world country soon and it seems like window to do something has long closed.
you can exercise all you can but if you keep eating fried chicken it's going to keep sabotaging your outcomes, so I think your biggest challenge is going to wean yourself off that and find other foods that give you joy without being detrimental to your health.  However Japan cuisine has a lot to offer and if there is anywhere that can happen it's there, so you're in the right place.  I think it's just a matter of experimenting and being more open to other foods.  All the best
Great Q&A, what a fantastic channel. I can't recommend it enough PS: I love that you are being mindful of your mental and physical health! Hopefully you will find joy in it and you have already inspired me to do the same!
We now need an embarrassing picture of Chris from Sharla! Let the war begin! Lol
Yes. Yes do it its going to make the time of Christmas even  more magical.
Unfortunately, the more I learn about japan the more I hate it. Instant regret for all the time that I have wasted learning their language. Thank you Mr Abroad. Your videos are awesome in all  aspects. I really like your editing and the way you present your videos
Xenophobia
Come back to Temple Uni! ;p
Great video. PLEASE OPEN JAPAN!!!!!
U should do wacky weekend with connor and visit a soapland😂😂
Am I the only one who's more interested in the title of each youtube video than the thumbnail? Like this video for example, the reason why I click on this (aside from I love watching Chris ranting) is because I genuinely want to know why Japan still bans foreigners, i didn't notice the thumbnail at all lol
I think I'll leave visiting Japan for another few years. If the country were to open up before the end of the year, if infection rates were to somehow increase, all us foreigners will get the blame for it.
Hyper-racism and hyper-xenophobia... That's why Japan is still banning foreigners after 2 years. I wish we in the Western world would stop giving the Japanese a free pass on their extreme racist/xenophobic/ethnocentric behaviour & actions. It's 2022 FFS! :/.
Love the Christmas Carol idea. Also with the protagonists you have suggested.
Chris' 1980's style workout montage has given me the burst of inspiration I need to lose weight and get fit!!! Too bad the inspiration will only last 5 seconds before I go eat 5 pounds of fried chicken.
Good to see you're back into fitness now,  Chris
Johnny Smoke is hilarious. Mediocre. Enjoy your 86 subs, bro.
holy moly you actually DO kinda look like rocky in that last shot. keep fighting, brother! i've just gotten back to the gym and eating right again as well, and i bet hundreds (or thousands!) more of your viewers are too.  LET'S GOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@5:25 I guess Chris is single again now.
= )
Your Fukishima Doc is one of my favorite vids of yours, such great work
Would you really be able to make a Christmas movie in a month
Dew it chris! DEW IT!
ABROAD IN JAPAN CHRISTMAS CAROL YES
<3
Connor trapped in the van caught off guard ... My keyboard does not like coffee spilled on it. 😮‍💨
Please do it! 🎄🎅
My cycle through Japan trip has been on Hold for 2 years. Lemme in!
It’s so weird to see Chris doing ad reads. Not that I mind, get that bag young man!
Lol even if joey and the bois don't care much for your cinematography, I and I'm sure most everyone here loves it. You really do take from stunning, beautiful shots. It's amazing how much your channel has grown over the years in terms of not only size, but also quality. You're one of the few youtubers I actually follow regularly Chris, I can't believe how long it's been now.
Congratulations on ten, mate. NGL though... If that's what your kid would look like. Definitely not a 4 out of 10. But I like girls with glasses, so I'm biased. All messing about aside; keep up the good work, and here's to another 10. Cheers mate.
oh darn I missed it, please come to temple to do a workshop again!!
A big Christmas event involving guests would probably become the most popular video on your channel..You owe it to yourself to do a proper holiday special. Great job with the exercise Chris, I know it's tough, keep going and remember why YOU decided to start.
Nothing wrong with your thumbnails Chris. You got to do what you got to do to stand out.
I'm coming for work, but I'll take an extra week off just for visiting. Will that pose any "tourist"problems?
Man's training for creator clash
You're certainly inspiring me to workout more with your work ethic and strong push towards being healthy! From one 32-year-old to another, we can do this!
Thanks for the motivational montage. I used to be active and go on regular mountain biking trips, but ever since shitty 2020 I gained about 10kg.
Let's be real the reason Japan is still banning foreigners is they don't want Foreign men sleeping with their women, even though the reason their men aren't sleeping with them is their own doing with 12 hours plus unpaid drinking overtime with the boss and trying their best to lower sexualization *looks at the ban on ponytails*
Dangerous and dicey workouts will get you YouTube views, but won't be sustainable to your health long-term.
I'd watch the Abroad Christmas carol.
Old fella at 7:59 is actually in Thailand at MK, a famous sukiyaki chain. Neat!
Maybe, to get a bit a relaxation, you should come to Germany. Here, people say: Not  critizing something is enough praise. Critisising our own country is a German hobby. And Germans really have difficulties in saying something nice about Germany.
Please do your Version of a Christmas carol. I think it would be great.  Even if its just you reading a children's book and mini skits
creator clash 2023?
I like the word content creator.
yay old people ruining the world generation after generation
The current head is  elitist and coward.....
I'm really glad I got to visit Japan in 2015. I distinctly remembering wandering Kyoto on my own, Being drawn by a temple tower with many rooftops, and while walking there, saw a tiny restaurant. There was no menu, The man just made some fish and used a blowtorch on a fruit. It was absolutely delicious. I love random encounters like these. Not everything needs to be 100% planned out.
Japan is inherently foreigner averse which stems from repeated trends in their history. This attitude has pretty much trickled down over the centuries and decades. Having lived in Kyoto for two years during the height of the epidemic, none of the locals want tourists back and the attitude towards foreigners from your normal everyday interactions is not the same as what you get as a tourist in the major tourist attractions. If you want to experience racism as a white person (which actually is weirdly a good thing), live in Japan for a while.
you look lke homer smpson  on the Japanese washing powder when you shave your mustache
If you could/want make a workout improvement series! That would be super cool and I am sure it will be so rewarding! 😁  You got this! Congratulations on continued motivation to improve your health ☀️
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life." - John 3:16 KJV
EAT YOUR SALMON
I love that this video featured friends throughout. It seems our boy Chris is finally done being a lonely grouch. Well done. 👍🏼
foreigner ban talk starts at 18:00
I am go to be honest here... I have always liked your videos, but the last 2 were exactly as you described them... very click baiting, and because of that I just ignored them, but after listening to your explanation why they were like this, and understanding why you have to do it like this, I will watch them... no matter what dude, keep doing the videos your way... at least I will always like them. ;)
I don't like boxing as a competitive sport, but boxing training is one of the best to get in shape. And you have Nick to do it with.
Hope he's still alive after showing that picture of Sharla ;) lol
i rememebr you like philosophy, that book you had in your apartment. given you are in japan (obviously), have you done any buddhist philosophy? Zen is very very interesting but no one seems to talk about it any more
Yeees Xmas carol! 🎄🎅☃
They just lifted the ban for Sept 7th...
kind of crazy how Japan is using the covid situation to keep everyone out still
So you're in Japan, home to many physical martial arts, and you do boxing? Good to see you doing something though. And I like your attitude to getting into shape
proud of you
Kuma ni gochuui, Chris! On a bicacle you are easy Frey for them..
Drink more, more tax , more babies, more babies , more ppl, drink more... etc.. ahhh the circle of life
i mean about acting like everything is great food and shit, u dont have to do it just coz ur in japan. Be real dont be weak
I'm not here to watch adverts.  Unsubscribed.
love your videos Chris!! maybe make a philosophy collab with Pewdiepie??
ABROAD IN JAPAN CHRISTMAS CAROL! Would be elite
Chris please make the abroad in japan christmas carol i am begging you
some please tell me where i can order haichu's online
9:26 ypu should start to use more inventive/odd praises like "this meal was better than 3-some with playboy models" :D
Making them drink is just going to end bad as a result lol who decided on that?
Now I know why those sweet calves are popping up during cycling and his arms are looking sturdy. But what was he doing on his macbook during lunch today while Connor was munching on his spaghetti? Highly suspicious!! 🤔
Totally feel like the natural UK "moaning about stuff" (we do) and constant sarcasm would be a genuine culture shock i never even considered before.   Is there like a Japanese equivalent to our universal "hows work"- "same shit different day" or "how're you"-"oh yknow, living the dream" ?  Such a random thought that will leave me pondering all day. Great vid as always Chris gg!
Looking forward to seeing Chris proudly wearing Debu Jyanai t-shirt.
You'd think the Japanese Government that's been struggling with birthing rates would be like "Birth More Children Please 😁!!!!"
Ever thought of going on Nebula like other youtubers have?
Chris likes muppets christmas carol, I always knew he was goated
Great vid
So, i watched this video this morning specifically because of the title, as I’ve been planning a trip to Japan for over 5 years now. I had it planned for 2020 originally and planned it for that year specifically due to the fact that it was a year after my son was discharged from the US Army and we were going to take the trip together.  I do understand the explanations that you give, but its sad that the elder Japanese aren’t taking the loss of tourism more seriously.  Yes, it may annoy them…it may upset their typical daily routines and it may even cause a few extra headaches that no one really wants to deal with, but they need to realize that the good out weighs the bad in this case. Here are some things that i cannot quite understand about their way of thinking.   Things that are in direct correlation to the problems Japan is currently experiencing with their economy:  This is the worst I’ve seen the exchange rate between the US dollar and Yen in a very long time.   They’ve lost revenue on alcohol sales…pretty sure that goes right back to the loss of tourism as well. When ppl are on vacation they drink. How is it their gov’t officials don’t see that very glaringly, obvious connection?  They wouldn’t need to try and coerce the young to drink more if they had the revenue coming in from the tourist industry.   Why would they rather promote ppl to do something that could be harmful to their health? Especially when alcoholism is already a rather large problem in their country.  Is their individual, personal comfort really more important to them than the state of their country and health of their younger population?   If they opened borders back up the economic swell would be almost immediate.  It makes me very sad, because it seems like it’s a very fixable issue and the elder population/gov’t seems to just not care as long as they aren’t being annoyed by tourists.
It isn't in the nature of a British man to not be judgemental/cynical.
9:19 kinda out of context xd
You’re easily one of the best creators on this platform due to your excellent quality and classic British presentation. Keep up the fantastic work
As far as cinematography I really enjoyed the Fukushima docu. They were moving and really set the tone. You absolutely outdid yourself on that one.
Soon this will be a fitfluencer channel called broad-shouldered in Japan 👍🏻
Impressive, you got Jeffrey Dean Morgan as your personal coach.
(guy makes tons of features, docs and webshows) HE'S NOT A FILMMAKER  I would love to see what these people do when they're not typing insanely petty, jealous Youtube comments, I'm genuinely curious.
This guy is not an apple pie😪🥴...he's just a mediocre chocolate cookie
Not enough star-fades!
Up nose  piggy lighting. All the rave in the mcu. And '2002 ' when you were like 12 man that when I moved to the UK 21 years ago today.
Read the title, started to watch ... 18 minutes in finally for 5 minutes of reasons why Japan still bans Foreigners. Then a bunch of off topic whatever. Maybe change the title so people who are interested in the subject described by the title can tell WTF you will be talking about
Video series idea: a bod in Japan.  A series of videos where you get into shape and craft your ideal bod
Congratulations, Chris! Let's go for 10 more!
I see Chris is already abiding by the government mandate to drink more. Good Job Chris, Japan is proud if you! ;-)  Great montage at the end, as someone who is currently also trying to loose wait (2,5-3 kg since easter) i hope it works out for you.
Edo 2.0
anyone else think the trainer looks like sylvester stallone?
Also  the US kitchen nightmares is a joke compared to certainly calmer UK version
He said number two 🤭
Why use tourism as a way to boost your economy when you can just turn your youth into alcoholics with a dependency and farm their money for the rest of their life.  I seriously don't know why people idolize this backwards country. I get that its beautiful and cultured or whatever, and i like Otaku culture as much as the next guy, but people act like Japan is a utopia when in fact it seems more like a dystopia.
Human beings are attracted to emotion, this is something that is taught in formal media production courses.  Getting a human to feel something...pain, fear, excitement, laughter, joy, thrilled....these are why they naturally are attracted to those weird thumbnails. They see an emotion and are drawn to it. We as humans are social by nature (which now breaches into topics of psychology) and our brain wants to relate and be involved with other human's experiences.
I mean one way to pressure Japan to reopen would be to restrict Japanese tourists going abroad in a similar manner. Might give cause for more to speak out when they experience the same difficulties. Been waiting for my family to be able to visit for 3 years now as it's quite hard for me to get enough time off to do that myself. It hasn't been easy...
DO THE CHRISTMAS CAROL MOVIE COMMENT
i knew chris was hitting the gym🙌 hope you keep going and achieve your goal👏
Chris getting prepped for the next Creator Clash
I'd watch abroad in a pan. But, where is the rEaL Chris broad. Hehehe
Open Wano Kuni!!
that montage really is the highlight
Sharla in that picture looks a little... baffled, but still cute!
Is being trained by Mr Junk Food Japan a good idea?
Oh shoot. I didn't even know they were comparing the drinking to the time of the bubble where like 70% of the people had more booze in their work drawers than papers.
I love this channel so much. Thanks Chris!
Please have a sparring session with Nicholas Pettas!
13:39 what the... xD
You look a lot more like Tim Roth than that basketball guy
the sake website only delivers in america wtf
I'm rooting for your health! Think 90 % diet and 10 % exercice for the losing weight part, and 50-50 for general health. Eat your fibres, and don't drink your calories. Good luck!!!!!!!!
“Wax on, whacks off...”
Oooh a stream of an Abroad in Japan Christmas Carol would be amazing, a sort of Christmas special, could get donations to the channel and/or charity
wow chris chan really had a glow up
A health theme is a great idea. Learn about autophagy. It improves health even more than exercise.
My words to Japan: “Open… the country. Stop… having it be closed”
If only they opened the doors, I could help the economy too 🍻
Not sure I can sleep after that Sharla jumpscare
I love your stuff! I think that you have a great show and I love the Bollocks and the Fxck offs, too and I think if people don't like your channel then they can fuck off!
Japan have all the right to close
Followed your journey from the start Chris. Really enjoyed every video. Keep up the great work dude👍🏻👌🙏🤘
hell yes for Christmas carol, Natski for scrooge!!
Chris-Mas Carol please
10 years wow greatz Chris.
Congratulations on 10 years on YouTube and thank you so so much for making such great videos and sharing them with us. You look amazing working out! I am so happy for your that you're taking care of your health and it definitely inspired me to start exercising myself. You can do it, Chris! :D I am very excited for all your future projects. May them be here, on VOD or anywhere else.
Congratulations on 10 years! Hyped for the biking video.
PLEASE do Abroad In Japan's version of A Christmas Carol, I beg of you!
They lost my respect,  Kids masked everywhere,  no thinking outside of the box..   crazy
I'd pay for Abroad in a pan :D
We NEED A Christmas Carol from you. Even if it’s written off as a personal passion project, do it!
Can we please start a petition to bring "Abroad in a pan" to life?
If you do a christmas carol Natsuki has to play scrooge
how many likes do we need for the abroad in japan Christmas special?
Abroad in Japan, Christmas Carol, with Santa Gelly! Please, will try to give money! <3
The extended ban on tourists in Japan has soured my impression of the country somewhat. I've been to Japan twice now and it was my favourite place to visit. Sure it has its problems like every country, but it's truly a unique place that has so much to experience that will always hold a special place in my heart. I'd love to go back in the future, but knowing that a considerable amount of the population (enough for politicians to be weary about saving cities from potential bankruptcy) don't want anything to do with people from the outside, it does accentuate that feeling of being unwelcome in the country.  I'm gonna be honest, I been kinda avoiding Abroad in Japan videos for the past year or so, not because the content is any less in terms of quality or Chris has become less of an affable character, but it's just a bit of a kick in the teeth to watch. Look at all these amazing places you're not allowed to visit!
The  Ussuri Brown bear that lives in Hakkaido generaly will avoid humans on instinct and their diet consists mainly of plant shots and salmon ! the only time they are know to become aggresive is with cubs around that said i would take some bear mace and a air horn can!
It sucks a good buddy of mine just moved there and me and him were close friends in school. Sucks that I'm still saving all my money to see this great country and I might not be able to for my upcoming birthday trip
Absolutely not true about having to say every dish is delicious, especially if you're a foreigner in Japan.  Nobody expects you to find every dish amazing.  There's just as much enjoyment and fun in people finding things disgusting, like in any other culture.  Even amongst Japanese people there are regional differences, look at natto popularity in Kansai or Kanto.  There is no expectation for visitor or native alike to blindly spout how much you love something when you find it unpalatable, and politely declining something is fully within normal social bounds.  Of course, if you do want a universal reaction of disgust, offer a Japanese person licorice - spitting it out and saying "mazui" is a common reaction!   As for Japanese TV shows _about food_ talking about food... well, yeah, they're food shows.  Try watching other TV shows.  "How Do You Like Wednesday?" is a really nice show for getting into Japanese humor, seeing a good slice of Japanese culture over the past 20 years, and the country itself as it involves a lot of travel - it's basically a YouTube channel before YouTube existed.
After q&a, it’s time for japlish video!
Your workout is actually working out because your weightloss is truly noticeable!! Keep it going, mate!🤘🏻
Ok Chris, i'll " Do it again , in your mouth "
“Do it again, in my mouth”  - Chris Broad
Send them Surströmming and see how "Sugoi" they find this :D
abroad in japan creator clash confirmed?
Plum sake is my favorite
I see Chris is training for the next youtube boxing event, cant wait to see him in the ring
i got as far as "...please do it again in my mouth..." and now i can't stop laughing 😂
So Japan is the new North Korea as far as foreign tourists are treated!
Now we want the Christmas Carol with the trash taste guys!
Chris' preparation to be in the next Youtuber boxing match is very commendable
If time is a social construct, are the multiple dimensions completely made up by our minds? 🤔 Therefore they don't exist.
Hey Chris, ive been watching your channel for a while now and really enjoy the content and i just wanted to say that im very much looking forward to seeing your development in physical and mental health. I think there are so many people who would like to be fitter but not so many who actually take action to reach that goal and im glad to see that you have.  All the best
No worries mate. I appreciate the shot! And a lot of shots you do! You're one of the creators who made me want to start doing videos 😊 Hope you get a deal to some platform to do your own show!
The Oohh Nooo, does that stem from mixed bathroom(saccidently unaware the particular booth is already taken), or lock your door or someone may burst into catch you on the toilet?
Stop biting your nails
How do you shake off the existential dread in the morning to have a productive day? Pls send tips.
Smash cut to Chris fighting Jake Paul in two years time.
Really hoping Japan opens up by early next year or even earlier. My fiancé and I are planning to do our honeymoon in Japan so hoping for the best
Within 30 minutes of me arriving in Japan I had an older gentleman deny me access to an elevator furiously and then told me to go back to my country
it just simple minded people that see those thumbnails and go wow it must be amazing but for me i just see another video from Chris and I'm excited no matter what it is
Hey Chris the shot at 7:13 is just amazingly beautiful! straight out of a movie
Hey Chris, just want to let you know, if you want to lose weight, you don't need to diet. You can literally eat anything you want as long as you eat less calories than your body needs to maintain its weight, thus lowering your body fat. Dieting can help since often times the foods are less calorie dense than the unhealthy processed foods we typically consume. Good luck and you're honestly amazing. Your channel is the most creative one on the platform. Thanks bro, i love you.
Weird video title, when Japan is now finally open for tourists, at least on tourist agency booked tours, even non-guided. The whole "visit with a minder" thing is not true anymore, you just can't book hotels by yourself but you can go wherever.
Abroad in creator clash?
Abroad in a Pan + Taken for Garnted, Garnt teaches Chris to make his World Famous Lasagna
VIP de Big
The Japanese government needs to write off everyone over 65 as already dead and conform policy accordingly (slashing medical benefits and subsidies to the elderly, enacting state funded childcare, and massively opening immigration and settlement to foreigners). Otherwise they all need to die faster so America can move in and turn the vacant land into the Disney Nippon Adventure Park and Cultural Preservation Center.
Abroad in a Pan needs to happen - The next Babish.
I have a few questions. Who are five of your favorite historical figures in the United Kingdom and Japan? And, why?
I'm glad you dislike the youtube thumbnail and title culture as much as i do. It's a necessary evil as apparently it works.
Yes, I would love to see your take on A Christmas Carol.
one of the best milestone vids i've ever watched from a youtuber. well done mate, looking forward to seeing what comes next
hey buddy i appreciate the drone shot, i also appreciate the honesty of the thumbnails and the algorithm. keep being real :)
Photo request backfired, lmao.
5:26 someone's sleeping on the couch tonight.  Also, Natsuki as a foul-mouthed Tiny Tim please.
... is this video now part of the darkest timeline chart?
Thabk you for introducing me to Spandau Ballet. Gold is now my edgynightwalkhome song.
15:58 the skipping form made me cry :c BUT good luck on your fitness journey
Do it Chris, do it.
i really love the idea of a xmas abroad in japan special - please xmas carol
So when's the trash taste chess-boxing tournament arc happening then?
Love your work dude, you mix your education advice of Japan, and humour in a delightful combination 👍
Dear Chris.  We all appreciate you and most of us wish you nothing more than the best for your health. And precisely because of that, here's a really important advice:  Please do NOT do back-crunches unsupported/with oressure in your neck/lower back. It fucks up your spine really badly. There's many other, much safer variants!  Sincerely A long time fan
Dont stress and worry about "reaching 40 out of shape". I highly doubt you will make it to 40.   I hope in the remaining few years you have left you will continue to entertain us with your awesome videos.
Your face already looks slimmer Chris. Hang in there!
Its funny how the Japanese government is pushing for more drinking, yet if they were more open to other recreational drugs, they could make a lot more money. I think young people understand the risks of drinking and choose not to participate, where marijuana is still a drug and smoking it is still burnt plant matter entering your lungs which is bad for you, there are other ways to take it and it can offer a lot of things that alcohol cant, but knowing the Japanese government, its unlikely for some time, but who knows...
Chris, this is just to let you know, that I DO APPRECIATE those shots. They make me want to go there and experience it myself. Thank you.
I don't want you to work for the BBC, Chris. For obvious reasons I wouldn't like to have to explain. I would love to see you on TV or Netflix, or some other suitable source where you get paid loads of money to do what you're doing now. I love you video's.
Christmas Carol - yes!
You're not preparing for a Creator Clash are you?
So your trainer is Nicholas Pettas? I'm so jealous....
We need to resurrect admiral Matthew Perry to send him to Tokyo bay on the battleship USS Missouri to open up Japan
Please do a Christmas Carol AbroadInJapanized :D
says all that about health and fitness while drinking alcohol, you really lack any discipline i agree
heck yeah do it for all of november
For what it’s worth, I really appreciate the effort you put into establishing shots and supposed B-roll. That Pharmacy shot and drone shots of the overgrown apartment building are among my favourites.
This might be a silly question but do you plan your videos with story boards. I’ve seen them do that for movies, that’s the extent of my knowledge.
Just realised: you and Sharla are an item.  Congratulations on that, seems like a lovely lass and congratulations on getting to ten years on the tubes. You are an entertaining and engaging host. KUTGW 👍
Looking forward to a Abroad in Japan take on “A Christmas Carol”!
fun fact: I'd be likelier to click on a video called "Abroad in Japan | Escape to Paradise Episode 2" than on one called "I booked a 3000$ room blah blah" because in my head that 3000$ title just says "wow hes gonna show some expensive hotel room, how original" but in reality you do much more interesting stuff in that video, so by seeing a title that just says "Escape to Paradise | Episode 2" my brain thinks: "huh? I wonder whats gonna happen in this video.." and that would be much more of a reason for me to click on it.  Now I totally get it, most people aren't like that and I also hate that clickbate culture, but I understand that you can't help it if you wanna survive on this platform. Just keep doing what you're doing Chris, love your content! cheers
Killer workout!
You should make a series called ‘A fit broad’. No?
You ARE joking with your pronunciation of "superlatives", right?
Chris please don't sell out to 🤮Netflix or the 🤮BBC. Your YT channel is great.
Yo Chris, i've wondered for a while: have you ever been/have plans to go to tsushima? Seems like one of the big ones you haven't made a vieo yet afaik.
That's it, now you HAVE to produce A Christmas Carol in Japan!
Sometimes I wish my country banned tourists. Just for a little bit
Good to hear you're training Chris! Time to get in the best shape of your life. Kick ass and chew bubblegum!!
For the people who really want to go to japan look in to the company named EF i did the same it was a awesome experience, i just get back from Tokyo 🔥🔥🔥
You making a christmas carol. Humbug i say, bah humbug.
I know everyone has their own health goals, and I'm super proud of you Chris for going after yours, but as an ACTUAL fat person, who is at least two of you, its really hard not to be bugged by the people making fun of you and calling you fat because, at worst, you have a "dad bod," and, at least in this horrible country I live in, that's all the rage.
You should make a YT channel with Sharmeleon and name it Chris with a (slang for woman) in Japan
I'm not here for fitness. I'm here to see Chris eating tons of delicious food.
14:50
Its amazing overall,
Damnnnnn I’m older than you Chris
the poltergeist is me
You just know Connor would have definitely used a Joseph Joestar meme for the 'oh no' 😂
8:59 Yeah, those pesky super-lay-tivs.
"You look like every white guy that moves to Japan" - literally untrue. The white guys I actually see around here look nothing like Chris. Chris actually looks pretty unique here IMO.
Abroad in Japan Christmas Carol would be amazing!
And here's to 10 more years of Chris showing us Japan while being a sassy baka!
Well I hope Sharla gave you permission to use that photo or you might be in trouble 😂
Natsuki as Scrooge? Yes please!
Chris sigma arck
Great shot of Sharla looking a wee bit off. Now *that's* how you make your new relationship blossom [ironic wink]!
wish you all the best for your health journey Chris , i have been there and i know that you can make a change for yourself!
having been influenced by your channel. I'm coming over to Japan in less than 2 weeks on a 'tailored' package holiday... the latest on that from what i've got is that it has to be planned by the travel agent, and i still need a visa but as of sept 7, you no longer need to be escorted by a guide, as such my holiday plan looks much like it did before the restrictions were a thing, i do have a question for anyone whos in the know... where do you go in Japan to break money into the smaller change (i gather that i need to keep stocked up on 100 yen coins)?
I am Bangladeshi, and we also have this social etiquettes to praise everything even though we like it or not. But I guess we have  certain tones when we praise. if its good we would say " mmm Darun" or "Khub moja khub moja" in higher pitch. If its moderately good we say "valo hoise" or "valoi".  If it's bad we would add a "NO" before praise, like 'Na, kharap na" or 'Na Na moja"! LOL. But we are not as strict as Japan. We can till talk our mind though elders will not like this attitude, but won't be shunt for that.
Great job on reaching the donation goal today! stay strong and keep being flexible like jelly!
WE WANT THE CHRISTMAS CAROL!!!
Congrats Chris, all the best
Leave it to japanese government to be obtuse and self-destructive. They will have to pay for plane tickets AGAIN. And I am more than ok with it.
"Do it again, in my mouth" 🤨🤨🤨🤨
You've discovered the secret to time travel, and are planning to venture back in time to visit somewhere on earth. How would you make sure you're not dropped into space in the earth/galaxy's current position and instead make sure you're also traveling back to the earth/galaxy's previous position to that point in time?
Wooooo alcoholism instead of tourism! Gotta love how governments always make sense (sarcasm)
Dude that "go fuck yourself" was so nostalgic 23:32
What is your take on determinism? :)
I guess you choose well with your gym partner at the end in Junk Food Japan Chris XD only problem is i suspect you'd both chain route in the face of tasty junk food. XD
I also have flights booked at the end of October, have been booked since November last year. Was absolutely positive the country would be open by now but it’s not looking good…
13:38 Did NOT see this skit coming 😆
I love the Japanese country side and the mom and pop places there are incredibly welcoming to foreign tourists, honestly some of the best service we've ever had. I just wish everyone in Japan would be as welcoming
"Bro your stomach, like mount fuji now" honestly killed me.
Ebeneezer CDawgVA is the best idea you've ever had! I love the muppets Christmas carol, that movie got me through Dickens in school!
legs go Chris get in shape!  would you be interned in youtube boxing? i really love to see one of Japanese YouTubers in the ring
heh, I know you think the same about the way American's pronounce it, but the way you pronounce superlatives is sugoi!
Bears? Spirits? Far too scary to do it? Chris, what if you got... five million views?
So you tell me, that Japan is still closed because of political reasons and not medical ones. How strange…
abroad in Japan A Christmas Carol, record it in a Scarecrow Village and make it an eerie horror with Scrooge having gone insane believing the scarecrow are people who are still alive turns out they're all in his head and as still as a post.
This definitely reinforces the narrative of the Japanese government made up of out-of-touch old people
Remember: you don't have to out run a bear, you just have to out run Connor
Regarding the clickbait-y thumbnails/titles: I recommended your channel to a few friends of mine, and when doing so I always went "Please ignore the titles/thumbnails, I know they're unpleasant, but the videos themselves are really good and down to earth!" and every single time it was met with an answer of "Oh wow you're right, those are actually fun! I saw that dude in my recommendations a lot but always avoided clicking bc of the unpleasant vibe I get from the thumbnails/titles". I myself had to get over that at first, too.   So idk, maybe it's a bit of a two-edged sword, that one. Personally, I think I would really enjoy it if the title itself (as in, the actual written part, not the title that's written on the thumbnail) could be a bit more descriptive? Like, here I would have appreciated a "Q&A" in the title, or it would be nice if the "Journey Across Japan" series had an indicator in their titles that this is, in fact, a new Journey across Japan video and not something unrelated! Clicking on your videos is always a big of a wildcard, because the titles usually only reveal one tiny aspect of it instead of the overarching topic :) This video right here is actually a good example of that, I came here expecting a 25 Minute commentary on Japan's current Corona/economical situation, not a Q&A!
"Do it again, in my mouth" ... Ok, uhm 🙃
Chris’ calf genetics are unmatched
What is the cheapest European country to fly to Japan from?
Please tell me you've got bikes that fit you this time!
Your fitness montage has come in just the right time. I needed the motivation to work on myself. And will be now alongside you.  Thanks man.
Oh noos! It's the mother of all imaginary problems: racism! How dare people decide who should be allowed into their own country?! Outrage! How dare people not like someone because they are from a different country?! Blasphemy! How dare the owner of a business reserve the right to prohibit entrance to anyone he deems undesirable?! Horrible fiend! Not liking someone because they are from another country is the worst crime in the world after eating pig's meat on a sabbath!
I have a great idea Chris you,natsuki and the anime man should make an entire video just about Haikyo and go visit different abounded places and buildings
5:30 😯 you're gonna get in trouble for that bro 😂
Yes to a christmas carol! Would be funny with a japanese styled one
Im not gonna ask a sirious nor complicated question, i just want to know how does the noodles behind you smell like?
This is because of supply chain brakes and war on horizon
Hey Chris you should try tracking everything you eat for at least 3 months - including calories. Enter your details on a TDEE calculator to find out what your maintenance calories are and aim to eat ~500 less each day. This is a lot more important than heavy exercise, in fact walking is the best exercise to lose weight as it does not make you overly hungry and will keep your energy levels stable. Personally I recommend eating a low carb breakfast (I always have a 4 egg omelette which sets me up for 28g protein and around 280 calories) and then snack on 2-3 peices of fruit in between meals if you have to. If you can't get access to a low carb breakfast I would actually recommend fasting until lunch, then supplementing some extra protein. Also don't go too low in healthy fats as they are good for satiety. Ideally you want to eat most of your carbs later in the day (this is called carb back-loading and has been shown to be effective at improving body composition, burning body fat during the day and providing your muscles with enough carbs to build muscle while resting).
I feel Connor be a great scruge, natasuki as one of the ghosts with his rhyme's
i must say you have indeed inspired me to push myself to get into shape too. you are an inspiration to all my young padawan
Perhaps as a Westerner, when you use superlatives such as sugoi you instinctively think people assume you're being sarcastic! Also, while the initial lockdown was justified by health risk and now political expediency, how can the government maintain it as a good thing when infections are still on the rise regardless and the damage to the economy?
I agree with your point of having creative freedom, if you were to work for Netflix, BBC or otherwise your would lose that to at least some degree. I'd support you either way as I'm sure many here would, but personally I want you to make what YOU want not what a corporation wants you to make.
23:32 I'm in tears, can't get enough of Natsuki.
#ASKABROAD (bcuz u wanted to be asked) talk abt life btw your videos are great          just kidding
Chris is training for his next fight with KSI ;)
stupid clickbait. didnt come here for blabla
I would love a fitness series!!! PLEASE!!!!!!
Saying you hate the thumbnails restored my faith in you.
I love ya work ... Enjoy !
Anyone else think Journey Across Japan would make a great Amazon Prime show?
Drinking from a square cup. 😅🤨
Today I learned that Mr. Affable himself can't say the word "Superlative". 10/10, would hear again xD!
Dude no you don't understand. My bf and I literally y e s t e r d a y fully cast Muppet Treasure Island with you as Long John Silver, Connor as Jim, Natsuki as Fozzie, and Joey as Kermit I literally just did a little dance in the loungeroom when you pulled up the Muppet Christmas Carol thing. Do it please omg.
I nearly didn't watch this one because of title 🤣 but glad I did, love a Q&A session, hope to see more in the future.
23:32 HAHA gets me every time
Abroad in a Christmas Carol plz
It' crazy that Covid is now essentially forgotten/ignored in the Western world (especially the UK which gave up on it long ago) yet everyone in Tokyo (et al) still takes precautions. You wonder what effect it might have on emigration, with the young looking to escape to the USA or Europe.   How is it in other Asian democratic countries now? Such as South Korea or Taiwan (if we park recent developments with China for a moment) when it comes to international tourism?
Ahhh 5:30mins .. i understand now why Sharla was threatening to unsubscribe earlier XD
As a fellow Brit I never comment and probably will not again and usually just watch, appreciate but say nothing. But let’s change the narrative.   Make Christmas Carol on YouTube!   You’re an incredible film maker and show a lot of versatility in your direction and shot selection from the comedy “commercials” to music videos to the documentary style. Plus I also think you’d make an amazing end of the work apocalyptic style film.  As a former film writer and production graduate I appreciate great film making. Keep up the great work.
As a Fellow Chris from the UK, and Member of the Secret Chris Society, I am also 32 years old and a little over weight and trying to lose weight before my own trip to London (A little less extravagant then Japan), I wish you the Best of luck and hope you achieve your weight loss goals Chris!! Also remember not to talk about the Secret Chris Society.
Brainwashed and rigid.
It’s absolutely shithouse that it’s basically borders closed… let’s hope it changes in 2023
As a fellow 40 year old Mount Fuji carrier i can only dream to come to japan and go on your training camp while helping to solve the Japanese drinking problem.
I think you love the money in christmas youtuber get for their videos
Chris, what is the meaning of life?
It's such a shame Japan still isn't open to tourists after so long, have a trip planned next year to fingers crossed they pull the finger out and open up 🤞
I did not click on the click bait stuff. I do not watch what I cannot afford.
Careful now, Chris' Trainer is Sylvester Stallone
I'm glad Japan keeps its borders closed, I just wish they'd make an exception for me. Maybe they should open with a strict vetting process.
my sister and her boyfriend recently visited japan and didn't need to join a group with a set amount of places to visit. They first went to the boyfriend's parents that live there since just before covid, and then just did whatever they wanted.
Japanese women want to f**k white men who need to go to the gym.
your thumbnails are not click bait, they're click enticing.
The having to praise food and other things in front of people really reminds me of being Irish 😂😂😂
Thanks Chris. You’ve help me and many others. Thanks for sharing so much culture and fun. Hope you have many more years
I mean, if you make a Christmas Carol I'll watch.
Yesss to Abroad in Japan Christmas Carol!!!!
ABoxerinJapan soon
Hey Chris ! I agree with you. The shot you make in Ikeshima is AMAZING GOOD !!! I LOVE it very much, it's high quality vision and art. Keep it up !!!
Congratulations on the 10 years Chris. Only feels like yesterday I was watching you play that flip the table arcade game
I'm 40 and my brother is 34. We still watch Muppet Christmas Carol every year. I just need to see Natsuki as Tinny Tim and Connor as the ghost of christmas present.
You would be the perfect scrooge because you complain ALL THE TIME! Yes!!! Do a CHRIStmas carol!
Chris risking it all with them photos! 🤣
I have my flights booked with 2 friends for May 2023, I'm keeping my fingers crossed the country opens by then.
Who thought being restricted to guided tours would bring in tourists? When I was in Japan I picked where I was going next the night before, and then arranged the accommodation. It made my kid sister (15) feel so secure in our lodging.
19:05 this reminded me of your "hotel, motel, holiday inn" pitbull reference from your hate comments video!  Natsukashii ne 😄
Japan allows their people to travel around the world but bans everybody from coming in unless it's on a tour. The world should treat Japanese citizens the same way until they open up
Some people are clearly extremely butthurt and full of envy ;) Love your channel and your sarcastic but 100% benign demeanor :D @25:16 Shaking up the ol' DNA strings 8)
Great editing re: montage! 🎬Your boxing strikes match the emphatic beats of the music 🎵🥊
🙏🙏
Simple answer. They’re racist and they don’t want Gaijin in their country and want to prolong them coming in for as long as they can since japan knows that the other countries won’t ban them from entering for tourism.
You are looking super healthy already Chris!
By the end of the year??  Japan is cold as fu so you might as well right that off as "closed til hanami".
Hahaha the thing about saying oishii and sugoi got me crying laughing. My Japanese husband gets really annoyed when I say food is mazui. He even said "women shouldn't say that word". Think he's gotten used to it now though as occasionally he'll say food is maa maa.. which means it's ok.. but coming from him it means its the worst food haha 🤣
Next project: Journey Across Japan featuring Pewdiepie
Why's he drinking out of a box? Does he not have glasses? /s
Me watching this at 4 am eating 2 double pounders fries and a 2 piece I’m not feeling guilty
I've been saying this a lot but I honestly wouldn't be surprised if the older generations would just love for the country to be closed off to the rest of the world like it was 300 years ago
i cant blame japan banning visiters. i wouldnt want some stranger come visit my home and mess it up.
Chris, I feel the utmost sympathy towards your goal of getting healthier and happier. I'm a 34 year old father of a 1,5 year old now, though my "pregnancy" began after his birth. 120kg as of today and sweating more than usually, and not of the heat. You inspired it: Starting running again first thing in the morning! All the best ✊❤️
Super what ?
The Last Supper wasn’t that great. They had bloody wine and flat bread and then they killed the host.
It was nice to hear you answers on this q and a (my question wasn't on the list though). That ending though... you know how to box now? Hmm... other youtubers did this creator clash thing recently. You think you could ever join in an event like that?
Omc pleeeeeeease YESSSSSSS  I love x-mas and your spin on A Christmas Carol would save the whole year!❤️❤️❤️❤️
someones gonna be single
Sasuga Calpis.
Love it when you read the comments at the beginning of these, really entertaining!
Superlatives - never heard it pronoonced like that before - congrats on the ten years
Do British people pronounce 'superlatives' the way Chris is pronouncing it? Here in the US its pronounced differently, but I realize I've never heard a Brit say the word until hearing Chris say it.
I don't recommend to be a Youtuber, I've been doing it for 2,5 years, made over 120 videos and still didn't make a penny. 😥
I really don't understand the algorithm and thumbail/title trends. If anything, I try to avoid the videos that have the corny thumbnails and clickbaity titles. Like I just wanna know what the video is actually about
love the humor and your video skills the best channel for me about japan
Do it Chris. Make the fucking Abroad in Japan KFC Carol
An Abroad in Japan Christmas Carol would be great  :)  I could see it now, Natsuki Cratchit telling Scrooge to "Go __ yourself". An instant classic .
I'm happy you hate those Youtube faces as much as I do.
32 and overweight. that hit me hard
9:19  That's what she said
Ngl, It's kind of hot watching you work out.
Good luck with your exercising and health Chris! You can do it man!😁🙏
"Shut up and drink more!" If the British government told its citizens that then I bet there would be a deafening roar of acceptance from all over the UK.
I wish i could train, run, go to the gym and exercise 🥲 But right now i need to heal my damaged right knee and my left ankle 🥲 i have my first chance ever to get a job ( im 32-year-old) and also they all love me there and i love it to.  They been kind enought to wait for my injuries to get better 🥲  They have been waiting for over 2 months already 😭  also, i can't walk much and can´t run as it would make everything worse 😭 ( i love moving exercise its my biggest joy )
The fact that you and Conner haven't physically beaten each other to death yet for the trauma you put each other through, speaks volumes about your friendship.  Again, congrats to you on the 10 year milestone, stay safe, and here's to many more!
why would a british man living in japan advertise a company that only ships within the us?
Nicholas is a GREAT guy, I really hope his channel grows fast. Awesome seeing you train together.
Glad to jest that you start taking care of yourself. Im 8  Years older and look way better and when i saw you in a pool episode i was a bit shocked, that is not good look . Not writing it to insult you just to encourage you to do more and find sport you like and take joy in it . Then you will have fun and get fitter in the same time.
Bring some bear spray!
Discovered your channel 2 days ago. You absolutely rock!
I wonder, who else googled the meaning of ''Soapland'' 🤣🤣🤣
Id absolutely love abroad in Japan: the Christmas Carole edition haha
I think Chris' left nostril is bigger than the other, because he's left handed... 😉
The haircut is back!
If you keep this workout regiment up you’re gonna go from Chris Broad to Chris Broad-Shoulders
Y'know Chris, if you want to work at the BBC you should really talk to Garnt, I heard he worked there before so he might be your in.
To be fair, I think you can make the thumbnails you want. You have such a big audience already, we will watch your videos regardless. Just do what you want.
japan really, really, really sucks. sorry weebs. it does. Country with the least sexual interactions, country where even if its disgusting you HAVE TO put up a charade of enthusiasm. They are more closed up than australia, rampantly racist, retrograde... I know. exotic, different, but all the above as well.
Seeing Connor tied up in the boot of your car. That alone makes the vid worth it >:D But srsly, you do take really great shots in your vids. You've got a good eye for viewing the world.
12:45 buddy sounds like a Minecraft sheep
This sake delivering sounds amazing, sadly they dont deliver to EU only to the US. Hope they will expand and include EU as a delivery option in the future. Anyway congrats for the anniversary wish you the all the best!
9:25 Ayo??????
I can't wait for Chris to announce his involvement in Creator Clash 2 XD
Please do that Christmas carol remake created by you. In fact I’m almost expecting it now I hope to see it come out
Congrats on 10 years!
I was watching this new Japanese mini-drama series called something loosely translated to night drinking's etiquette. And I thought it was utterly strange that she kept repeating the line: if you drink it this way like me, you will definitely fall in love with alcohol! and i was like...wtf? now putting the two and two together....
Of course you should spend the whole of November creating your own version of A Christmas carol, life is too short not to!
A Christmas Carol please
Loved the video as always and I wish you good luck with your training!
Chris, as a married man, its never a good idea to poke fun of your SO. Even if you are 100% joking. Just throw in a sorry to Sharla if she sees the video.
But who monitors your fitness monitor?
You already look way fitter! It pays off.
considering this came out during the tour with Connor, yeah i can safely say the Montage is working
What a brilliantly honest Q&A session, absolutely fantastic responses, well done Chris!
The 80’s montage will be even better after you get fitter and do everything effortlessly afterwards. Keep the clip to edit more for the end results 🐕
I think i speak for all of us when i say that we would love an Abroad in Japan Christmas Carol
This is weird, because I get commercials to visit Japan on Youtube.
If you really want to do a christmas movie, go for it But take your time, you shouldn't try to rush things!
I tried to get to the round school house in Hokkaido last month, the access has been blocked off by a company.
Training with nic must be a blast, genuinly envious.
Abroad In A Pan would slap, cooking and eating videos usually do well. Calfreezy's Youtuber cook off basically revived his channel
Congratulations on 10 years :) Health wise you can do it, I'm nearly 40 and I run and skateboard multiple times a week. It all comes from visualizing the life you want to have and just doing it.  Re Japan opening up I've been thinking about this and I think some it is down to Japan's pride in the "Japan model", which has been shown to overall not be immune to how damn contagious corona actually is. At the moment with all the entry requirements with PCR tests on departure, imagine if all these healthy tourists come to Japan, arrive and then soon after arriving many get corona. This would highlight to the world just how widespread it is in Japan and show that there isn't some particularly special afoot here. In fact there was that awful case recently of where a man had a crash on his motorcycle, broke his leg and then on the way to the hospital in the ambulance he tested positive for corona, so the ambulance took the man back to where he had the accident and dropped him off because the hospital wouldn't admit him.... a sobering thought about how special the so-called Japan model is....don't get me wrong, I love Japan but it's not without faults.
Bummer dude, went to get some Sake but they only deliver to the US?
"YES please, do it again... In my mouth"  - Chris Broad
hey Chris, I have a philosophy question for you.   What do you think the japanese or western way of treating the dead?  When i first heard of people 'picking bones' in japan, i was somewhat horrified thinking it disrespectful to the dead.   I have grown the think of it as just another way of being respectful, that really demonstrates how different cultures can be.
Forget Netflix, they don't deserve you!
9:26 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
What famous hero's does Japan have we have William Wallace I was thinking you could do a tour around famous Japanese spots like the 47  Ronin and other historical figures in Japan bro
No, it simply isn't true...when you use clickbait titles, you end up disappointing a lot of people. Other channels, which don't use clickbait titles, do very well. You just need to improve your imagination...or something.
Kind of sucks that you feel as if you haven't done anything good. As someone who has had depression and anxiety my entire life and no support system, you have done more in your life than I (and I am sure many others) have in my 38 years on this earth. What I want in life isn't what society expects you to want, or are things you can't due without support (money or otherwise), so people always look down on me for being "directionless" and not having what they expect me to have. Being a good person and loyal friend (which multiple people have said I am) doesn't count for much these days. I see so many good people choose to be friends with or, worse, in relationships with people that are genuinely toxic, just because those people have what society expects you to have. To my point, you live a life that is only a dream to many of us, have loved ones who care and make time for you, and you get to make incredible videos that make people like myself smile and forget about the shit going on around us. Never undermine how much you do. You do a lot of good, and I truly hope that one day you can see that and that you don't base doing good on having a "dad bod." 😛
I honestly nearly didn't watch the Okinawa villa video because I got sick of 'I spent X-amount of money on this crazy thing!' on your video titles. I always thought 'Well, I'm not going to be able to relate to that or repeat the same thing in my Japanese adventures, so I shouldn't bother'. I'm glad I did in the end as it was a great and fun adventure and the cost was largely irrelevant. Thanks for addressing this as it gives me faith that it's just to appeal to the algorithm gods and I can just ignore the title and get stuck into the videos from now on. Cheers!
Has connor been freed yet? poor guy
Nah Chris is great Film Maker the shots he used on his Videos is top notch
BIG FAT  TACO                 (Totally didn't write this to make it to a video. And this is not at all FFXIV raid reference instead of an insult. Love Christ ♥♥♥♥♥ Ty for updates)
Hey Chris. Thank you for this Video. Missed the old style comment reviews. Also nice to see you getting all sporty again. I always loved your first abroad series. I know you don´t but there is more to see on foot or bike than in a car.
The Muppets Christmas Carol is my favourite Christmas movie but I feel like the abroad in Japan Christmas Carol would be a close call 🤣
Not only do i watch these videos for Chris's radiating personality, but the shots indeed are top tier! Keep being awesome dude!
What cities will you be cycling through in Hokkaido?
Japan at the start of covid: smart well thought out handled well Japan 2 years later: we've entered our American afraid of everything phase man that meme in the 90s about Japan adopting American fads just late was spot on.
YES PLEASE DO ABROAD IN JAPAN CHRISTMAS CAROL!!! Make Natsuki the ghost of Christmas past, he can tell Ebenezer to "go f*ck himself", I don't mind what character Connor plays as long as he does the "too much volcano dance" and Risottoro can be Tiny Tim.
lmao that Soapland explanation was golden!!!
Japan is a strange place, best visited by watching abroad in Japan. I believe that people in Japan are already evolved in to being half robots. So sad!
This is what I take away from this video: "YES, PLEASE, DO IT AGAIN, IN MY MOUTH!" - Chris Broad
12:57 That‘s why I didn‘t clicked on the last video yet…
The best part about living in Japan right now is that good Airbnb's are extremely cheap because there are barely any tourists renting them out.
What drone do you use, would love to get one but unsure where to start with it?
Also i have a question as well - what Japanese Car do you like the most?
I think you are awesome. Period :D
great acting, Connor 😂👏
I love your“Rocky” montage at the end. I’m glad you’re prioritising your well-being. Nothing is more important! I’m 42 now, so my 30s are over but still close enough to be vivid in my memory. I literally lost count of how many times I almost died during my 30s, so don’t panic, and keep looking after yourself. I really do mean that, Chris. I almost bled to death hundreds of times, permanently lost the use of a lung and had pneumonia 4 times in the one I do have. I had endometriosis so badly that I ruptured my left ovary and then ended up with sepsis and multiple organ failure. I barely recovered from that ordeal only to repeated it all over again when my right ovary ruptured too 6 weeks later! I had been cursed with these sorts of problems since the age of 11, so at 37 I had the operation that frankly saved my life: a radical hysterectomy. That means no reproductive organs are left. There’s much more that I could mention (repeatedly breaking & dislocating things etc) but that list will suffice. So, you see, Chris, if I can live through all that kind of grief, remain self employed throughout and still have a sense of humour, you can too. Best of luck with everything! ❤️
"Yes please! Do it again, in my mouth! ~Chris 2022
I loved the shots you took of the abandoned city and Okinawa and well many other. You cinematography is great - if joey can't see that, give him glasses 😅
Abroad in japan Christmas carol pls
PLEASE MAKE A CHRISTMAS CAROL. I NEED IT!!!!
I dont know about the overlap in your viewership but one thing i found really interesting is apparently Magic the gathering is very popular in Japan, do you have any sort of insight as to why that might be?
I appreciate your honesty.  As someone who very much plans to visit Japan before the end of his days, your videos 100% help give some insight before doing so.
@firstwefeast Get this man on your channel
Yes please do Christmas carol. please
15:42 if your jokes about fried chicken are true the best thing you can do for your health is learn how to cook. Trust me.
"Do it again, in my mouth"  -Chris 2022
PLEASE DO A BROADS  (& Muppets) CHRISTMAS CAROL
I'd absolutely love to see an Abroad in Japan Christmas Carol ^^
Okay but BBB's comment was pretty funny ngl
Would love to see the Christmas carol. And yes you deserve a Netflix show! Either way doing it on YT gives you the creative freedom. So keep that and hopefully you can also do a side project on Netflix, just don't sell your soul to them. Production companies are evil
I have a question. Did Sharla recommend your current hairstyle? I only ask because she has so much better taste than you and you suddenly start to look cool. I am kidding, no that's a lie. She is way cooler than you.
Thanks for explaining the thumbs I feel much better. Really.  Cheers
"Open the country. Stop having it be closed".
YES to the Christmas Carol Idea! Natsuki as the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come would be hilarious
If 5% of all your tax revenue comes from booze, you might have a national alcoholism problem. And now they want to get back to that level? *facepalm*
If you could get Natsuki to play Tiny Tim and Joey, Connor and Garnt the three ghosts. Yes. Please do the Christmas Carol.
They can't compare to the 80s, it artificial money basically.
Haikyo. That's it, the next Shounen Jump greatest hit! Omg did you just make fun of Hajime-shachou?! Sugoi (honestly)
chris dont listen to them you are sexy as hell with a big ol ba donk a donk
bro you should get into judo
Hiya bro a think your the best YouTuber on Japan I'm from Scotland and always wanted to visit Japan I have watched your YouTube Channel a love it but here keep it up a really like watching your videos
Christmas Carol. Now.
How would you like to die? It is not a threat. I am asking when it happens, how would you like to go? It was an article I read last night. For me, I'd like a heart attack or go to sleep and just not wake up.
Call me a pleb, I love plum sakes. There are some good and flavorful rice wines, but plum just puts a smile on my face.
11:45 WHAAAAAT, that shot was bloody brilliant
"Open the country. Stop having it be closed." -Chris
Travel restrictions: Unfortunately, in Japan, new COVID-19 cases and deaths are at an all time high
i want abroad in a pan
A CHRISmas carol would be awesomr
Japan is the best country in the world 🌍🌎
Glad to see you working out with Nick, keep it up Chris, I'm also trying to get fit! Regards from Barcelona
Health and fitness is not achieved by a strenuous crash diet/training period. It is achieved by small steps on a daily basis: one less cake, quit smoking, do 10 more minutes of exercises and all that. In time you could add volume to your training, or work harder on the diet to get to some fat percentage, for example, but those are more advanced goals that should be pursued later. If you crash-do something you are going to rebound right after the strenuous period. If you did "restore" your health by working with a plan over the next two years, rather than four months, you'd be delivering an incredible message. Think about that.
Now THAT'S a sponsor!
WE NEED ABROAD IN A CHRISTMAS CARROL! NOW
I admit I enjoyed the fitness montage far more than I thought I would :D it's a shame "eye of the tiger" would probably get you in copyright trouble
Do you think you will do a video with Felix (pewdiepie)?
I don't mean to mess with your mental attitude towards getting "fit" and I still highly recommend it. But if you are capable of doing a 700km cycle with practical no training. Your health isn't as bad as you think it is. But still after buying that expensive as hell bike, might as well get the miles in xd, good luck on your journey to a better self.
You're gonna make it brother, we're all gonna make it 💪
I'm giving you the excuse, the Christmas carol.
Ohh this video is good 😂 loved it hahaha
Do Chrismasu Carol!!!
Man i really hope to visit next year 2023. Been planning to propose to my girlfriend in Japan. had the whole idea in my head. This was 3 years ago... Open up Japan onegai!
You're the only YouTuber whose videos I watch despite the title and thumbnails seeming clickbait-y at times because I know your videos are incredibly down-to-earth and there's probably gonna be something valuable in it that I'm rarely gonna see in videos made by other YouTubers. This video itself proves my point.
i've lived in Japan 6 years now and I can't stand the fakeness on TV.  Nobody is ever honest or actually reviews things. Its all amazing and delicious and they have to like one up each other. Like scream bloody murder flip over the table kick a cat and yell how delicious it is..... It could literally be plain white rice lol
I like how some of the boxing sequence match with the music, you're actually really good in boxing. Chris creator clash when
Wise people,  don't wont woke trash like gayers and feminasi destroy the country, no nwo!
Has Japan's views on reincarnation changed your own views from before you lived there? That is to say if you had a more christian background perhaps, has that changed at all because of the influence of living in japan?
My favourite part of visiting Japan is the serendipity of stumbling across a cute little shop or cafe or even a back street - going on an organised tour feels like the worst way to explore Japan.
Covid has ruined Asia. Especially Japan. Been here since 6 years and loved every single minute of it. Ever since Covid hit I really fucking hate it.
Natsuki in A Christmas Carol? Connor as Tiny Tim? I'm here for it
Chris you're doing fantastic work in both your videos and fitness! Keep up the hard work!
What's the answer to Life the universe and everything?
Why are you shaming those two women? I don't get the joke. You showed their faces and basically called them ugly.
Chris, if I see you in Tokyo (during my vacation) can I ask for autograph? :D
lol i love that sharla asked to show photos the internet hasnt seen an the most affable chris chose a pic of sharla to start the gauntlet
Have I been saying superlative wrong all my life or has Chris had too much Canadian influence? Super Lative? Sounds like a laxative. 😅
Chris training to be on the next creator clash?! Love this Q&A, lots of insightful stuff!
Guess you were a pretty bad hit man since on tokidori interrogation you said you didn't know if you killed anyone
It's sue-pear-lah-tive not super-late-tiv
Crazy that a country like Japan would bow down to the Tyrants who started this Plandemic and keeping the charade going.
If you are really desperate you always can go as a sumo wrestler, only gains there.
I woke up literally two days ago turning 40 after having spent my 30s being overweight. Don’t knock it till you’ve tried it. During that time I’ve climbed mountains, ridden rollercoasters, taught myself to swim, travelled all over the place, basically the only thing I haven’t been able to do was bungee which after watching your last whacky weekend you won’t be doing anytime soon.  My point is, don’t let yourself be beaten silly by some standards that aren’t set for western adults anyway.
Could be worse, the UK is buggered.
Chris you have always been an inspiration to me.
Petition to make Abroad in Japan a Christmas carol!!
The other problem with visiting as a tourist at the moment is you need a visa. Here in the UK you either have to do this in person or use an expensive visa agency. If you do do it in person you have to travel to the embassy (or one of a few consulates) both to queue and drop off the form and then again a week or so later to pick it up. On top of that the UK embassy has been overwhelmed with demand, mainly I think from students like our son who have had their study abroad postponed several times, such that appointments were going within seconds. So tourism from the UK only going to become feasible in larger numbers once the visa waiver is back in place.  There was also the need to get (and worry about failing) the preflight PCR test but at least that rule is being phased out, luckily the day before he leaves.
Please do the Abroad in Japan Christmas Carol video :D
It's creepy how much you sound like Scooby-Doo, when you parody YT comments.
I don't mind your "twatty click baity titles" because your content and/or presentation almost always suits my interests. Feel free to feed the algorithm, we're all still watching. :)
My guy Chris flexing with the OG UK passport.
Well now, Chris... after watching your video I want to ask you if you are interested or know anything about Quantum Physics ? I have found it to be a beautiful and highly interesting subject, given its pertinence to life everywhere in the Universe. Possibly even the scientific example of what some call "God" ?...  On another note, Natsuki should be Scrooge if you ever do your Muppet movie ... "Go fu k yourself" is the modern equivalent of "bah humbug", is it not ? ! Hehe You would make a super Bob Cratchet..  I LOVED your montage.. excellent music, reminiscent of Bon Jovi "I'd Die for You".. you made me sweat and feel tired just watching 😩🤣🤣  Love your videos, and if you ever branched out of YouTube to make your "real" films , I would love to see them ! Love from Leicestershire, UK 👊🤘 X
I very much appreciate the beautifull landscape shots you make!
I don't watch you much, but I instantly realised you look a lot fitter and have lost some weight. I don't judge anyone for their looks or physique, but massive props to you for making the changes, and 700km is no light feat! Good luck!
Really hope Japan can open.  I'll be in Vietnam and Thailand for the rest of the year, as of next month.  Japan was my first choice, but a Japan and Thailand trip became a Thailand and Vietnam trip.
This is why you dont want big liberal governments...
I dont understand why you'd read those comments out loud they don't deserve a place to be heard  they are not critiquing you  they are just mocking you
The elders in Japan are pretty much on the when we go we're taking the economy with us.  Now drink up kids so you won't remember any of this.
Chef: try my boiled water Japan: oishi
YOU STINK!  no but for real thanks for all of the content that you keep sending our way it makes my day every time i see an upload <3 (ps i don't think you stink, just catching your eye :)
9:26  Omfg what kind of chef's are you talking to at these restaurants lmaoo
What is the video of Batman Connor? Never seen that before
I hated that thumbnail as well.  That's why I didn't watch it.
seeing the title of this video is quite strange after seeing news that japan is going to open its borders this month.
I feel like I’m in the minority who wouldn’t mind having a guided tour or a pre planned trip with a travel agency. I like having a schedule and if I’m free todo whatever when I get to Japan I’d feel like I’m wasting time figuring out I want to do. Plus it’d be nice to have support and guidance when going to a foreign country since it can be intimidating for first time travelers like me. I also have a bad habit of sitting around all day when on vacation. Whenever I go on family vacations all I want to do is stay in the hotel room and watch YouTube or play video games. A planned trip would really help me break that habit.
the segment were you say "everything in Japan has to be amazing and everyone is friendly and positive" !, check out a programe called Morning Masume and a segment within the show called "when the bus comes" i cant understand a word they are saying but it is addictive and it looks like the majority of it is different characters taking the piss out of each other...check it out its brilliant but it also looks like a different side to Japanese tv, it looks like a Saturday morning show, but filled with irony and sarcasm.
Appreciate the honesty with the click-bait thumbnails. I honestly thought its very uncharacteristic of you, now I know why... and your honesty made me respect you more as a content creator. To more years with Abroad in Japan!
Bah humbug!!!
Do the movie
The sake isn't going to help get in shape. Human body refuses to burn any fat and build muscle as long as there is ethanol in the system.
Happy 10th Anniversary Chris!!!  The Japanese gov should really look into the gig economy we're all mired in right now, if we could actually get full employment with matching salary rather than the limited contracts so many people are working under right now, we might actually have more money to spend in izakaya, beer gardens or wine bars. "Barring" that, let the damned Tourists in! Getting a bunch of young people to drink and hob-knob is presently more risky than letting  in a bunch of foreigners in with their potential vectors and (more importantly for say, Kyoto) wallets.
Amazing video as always! So happy for your fitness journey, you will 100% be able to achieve your dream physique and be healthier. It feels incredible, believe me. We got full belief in you! :) Congrats on 10 years!
Chris, I’m happy that you said you also dislike your titles and thumbnails. Lately they are really irritating. But I guess you must do them to survive.
Those drone shots are so good! Don’t listen to Joey lol  I really enjoy watching your videos, they are very interesting and fun. I’ve been watching the cycle charity stream and you and Connor are great for doing that. I need some boost to start taking care of myself so I’m really looking forward to your next videos. Take care Chris!
9:23 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Firstly happy 10 year!  I’ll be honest the crazy facial expressions make me wait to click the videos…what makes me click is seeing the Abroad in Japan red banner and the beautiful shots.   Honestly the Christmas Carol would be absolutely interesting- maybe do it in a series base? Idk I’m sure you would make that amazing.  I binge watch your videos though because of the cinematic and equalized vocals being easy to have in the background. Great for focused watching to having on during cleaning or anxiety attacks.   Also I would love to see you collab with Shogo or King Kogi…just throwing that out there!
I was originally supposed to be visiting Japan for October but had to cancel </3
Chris-mas Abroad - doeeeiiit!
Congratulations on ten years
Will you be having a boxing match with the girl on the workout montage?
Chris, you are amazing and delicious! Thanks for 10 years of superb and enlightening entertainment. But...in my job as an audio director, would you mind me pointing out that the word SUPERLATIVE is pronounced sue-PURR-luh-tivv?
The constant clickbait titles and insults to my country
You should make a Christmas carol with natsuki, Connor and Joey as the ghosts of past present and future!
Wut??? 32? God I'm old....... I've spent 10 years with Chris and I just realised, he is younger than me xD
if you want money from us chris then STOP DENYING YOURSELF A TWITCH CHANNEL!!!!!
proud of you trying to get fitter. Please make a series out of this.
Abroad in a Christmas Carol? Absolutely!
Chris: "I love doing this on youtube, where I have full creative control over it" Also Chris: "60% of my ideas just go in the bin becouse I know they wouldn't do well on the algorithm" Jokes aside, sucks to not be able to fully express yourself or having to resort to cheap tactics to make the video do well; not only is a common evil across youtube but there's no sign of improvement on that
A Chris broad, Muppet Christmas carol hybrid! Yes!
Because it’s the dying shadow of a once great civilisation.
7:02 Yes, make it happen!  (this picture will haunt me)
Will you be hitting Sapporo during your Hokkaido cycle tour?
Around 13 minutes, mentioning that you have to pander to the algorhythm. Sadly, no. You have to pander to the bottom of your boot basic "person" - identical as if xeroxed - by the millions with no attention, very little actual intelligence and entitlement out the ass. You know the kind. I lament that, too.  So hey, if 60% of your ideas go in the bin because Youtube... ..why not fuck Youtube and just do your own thing elsewhere? Options exist, you make enough (easily) to do it, so...y'know. Why not?
That’s not how you say “superlative “😅
WE WANT ABROAD IN A PAN!! 🤣🍜🏔🇯🇵
30 off the first box? How much is the box lmao
These were softball questions.
I couldn't agree more about the answer to becoming an influencer. Healthy mindset is probably one of the most important factors (outside of being a narcissist :P )
I give you an officialz irrevokable and Romanian approve excuse to run off for 2 months and make a Christmas Carol video. Now get going, you beautiful Abroad 🎉
My Wife and I were meant to visit Japan again for our honeymoon back in March this year. Hopefully next year we can visit!
10:30 what was this video ??
Hey Chris big fan I'm also 32 and also out of shape and have been training for a Spartan race and have actually completed my first. If you do get fit enough i would recommend doing one.
secretly training for Creators Clash?
Now that your working out...I would love to see a small section, in all of your upcoming videos: a progression report. Small  or big, positive or negative. That way you can have 2,7 million ppl judging you...and motivating you :)
Hi you look like you lost 5 kg, have the same problem,  good work. 👍
I’d love to see you make an Abroad Christmas Coral. Please live that dream. I do wish Japan would open back up but overall I hope the government does what ever is actually best for the country. I’m sure the sweet Sweet tourism will be to good to hold out for politics sake.
People who experience facial flushing after consuming alcohol may have an increased risk of developing alcohol-related esophageal cancer so this policy really is hitting all of the wildest points
The first comment really destroyed you though 💀Can't wait for that 10 million subscriber special with Connor and Joey 😂
The next big YouTube boxer here we go
YESSS PLEASE DO IT AGAIN IN MY MOUTH -- Chris "affable" Broad, Sep 01 2022
Don’t listen to the haters, I’ve loved your content for the last 4-5 years and it’s been awesome seeing your channel develop!!
Pwahaha chris you twat XD you put that photo of Sharla in the preview video. i was laughing before i saw the video haha.
As someone who was quite chubby in school, but is now pretty athletically built  It's really about making small changes, and not suddenly changing everything. You're probably enacting this method already, but I mean like if you drink lets say a latte a day, you then instead can get a flat white, then an americano with milk, then a black coffee, slowly transitioning to healthier options is a really good way of making it easier to reduce down the calories, if you enact that with most the food you eat it's doable.  If you say sod it i'm going to eat salads, I reckon you wouldn't last a month  good luck Chris, as a fellow brit, I've enjoyed your videos from the first year you started posting, especially your story from office work to what you do now, that pushed me to go from depressed working as a barista, to learning programmer, finally just got a job as a statistical programmer this month!
もっと鎖国した方がいいっすよ♪
Wow Chris, at this rate you might be the next Ricky Hatton!
I like how healthy Chris and Connor's friendship is.
Wow you're getting training from your Junk Food Japan friend? That must be quite a workout
Do the Christmas carol. Just do it
Has it been 10 years already? Dam im getting old, just like chris. Here i am still remembering the 20k subs
Abroad in a Pan sounds amazing, I can already envision Gordon Ramsay himself coming to critique your shenanipans.
I hope Japan opens up to the rest of the world soon, but if the county's isolist history is anything to go by, I'm not surprised it's going to take a while yet. Honestly though, it's been four years since I went last, and I'd like to be able to visit my teachers living in Japan soon.  Btw, the clever timing of your punches to the music in your little montage at the end was great! Good luck with your weight loss journey and new lifestyle.
Been subb'd for almost 2 weeks now, seen almost all of your posts on both channels, some of them twice. Top quality and hilarious. Thank you Chris.
That subliminal EAT YOUR SALMON message hits different when you are in Norway 😅
Philosphy, ok, Uni just started back in the States, Hume done, Kant halfway through. Which do you side with? If that is even a thing, also, how freaking hard is Kant!
Twatty Click Bait. OH Love it. Looking forward to your twatty click bait image for cycling across Hokkaido (a bucket list trip for me - just cycled from Kent to the north tip of Scotland in your home country).
Maybe other countries should ban Japanese visitors until they allow them back in properly.
Abroad in Japan Christmas Carol let’s go!!!!!!
Love the honestly! Great video as always <3
I like your haircut Chris.
235,861st! Eat it losers.
18:04 video question
I have never asked a question, before. I really love this channel, for many reasons. Since Maneki-Neko cats might have resided in a temple, do you think they might harbor spirits, either good or bad?
Super laytives??? That's your Dom Perig Nog Mate😂😂
Congratulations 🎉👏 for ur 10yr journey
12:56 Funny thing about the titles for videos on YouTube nowadays is that I always end up missing episodes of something, and I hate it when I miss an episode in any series I am watching. When any YouTuber makes a series I hope that they either make it noticeable that it's part of a series or I hope that they put it in a playlist.
Japan's basically destroying its economy in order to give the *illusion* of safety to some. It's rather idiotic, but comes as little surprise given how short-sighted governments can be
Reasonably priced hitman :D :D :D
"I'm worried about waking up at 40 and being overweight and not doing anything."  -me, turning 40 in October and overweight and not doing anything.
Sharla and Chris chemistry is so wholesomeeee! loving the vibe
"Chris, how do you capture that gorgeous, perfect shot?!" Cuts to Connor dying and waking in the Church. Well.
"It's better than fucking the last supper" 😂 I'm not sure that would be that great, but might get a lot of views!
My first thought about the video title was this was because of Logan Paul.
thanks for the explanation for soapland! my family with 2 young kids have a thing for soap. Will definitely visit it during our next trip to Japan on 30th Feb ☺️
Shots looked good
Sooooooo happy for you chris.
I'm normally perfectly in favour of whitebashing jokes (I am white guy, calm down) but that dumbass hate commenter named watermainz in the video's intro _literally_ just objectively described what Chris Broad is. "Huhuh u look like a white guy living in Japan". That's because _he is_ a white guy living in Japan, you troglodyte. Are you going to laugh at Mt Fuji for being big too?
Chris getting ready to fight that bear at the end.
nice fresh fade, looking good mate.
In support of Japan alcohol, please do a episode on Japanese whisky, and visit the Suntory Yamazaki Distillery
Looks like Chris is training for the next Creator Clash
Maybe not Netflix, but I can definitely see Abroad in Japan on Nebula x Curiosity Stream
Thank you for talking about this! My original trip was planned for October 2020, but it has been postponed multiple times since. Currently booked for November this year, but I’m doubtful. Your videos have helped me learn a lot about the country for the past 2 years 😊
Big Japan boss. The workout looks great. Keep going
Yes to the christmas carol thing.
The Liberal Democratic Party may find their support dropping anyway, after it was exposed they have strong ties to the Unification Church, a multinational cult known as the "Moonies" outside Japan.
That guy who told you "Your stomach is Mt Fuji now" is disrespectful. You worked hard for that.
Yes please to the Christmas carol!
That face at the end is hilarious.
Finally a realistic take on the "becoming a youtuber" question. First developing something interesting to share before starting to share, is a simple but so often overlooked rule for media.
Im lucky my friends and I were able to go in 2019 summer. Best month of my life. And I've been trying to go back ever since, legit saving most of my spending money for it
❤👏
Anybody who just wants to be YouTuber or influencer is going to fail. You need to know something /do something/have something which people are interested in and then you use YT as a platform to communicate that. Content first; YT later. It's like journalism. You *cannot* get a start as a journalist unless you already have an expertise (politics, finance whatever) beforehand.
Just eat like a healthy person
Sugoi! Umai! Oishii desu! Last working and training montage was great!
I was once in a bar ordering an omakase highball where the guy would presumably just make me something he'd recommend or by the spur of inspiration. I ended up with a coke and orange liquor type deal, really not my thing. I told him "myeah, it's nice" and he seemed a bit disappointed. I'm really bad at feigning enjoyment when I'm not really feeling it.
So I watch a lot of Japanese travel/food vloggers. And karaage chicken! That’s the best thing since fried chicken to all of these vloggers. I had to try it! I had to find it! So I go to little Tokyo and I finally got my hands on some AND ITS JUST FRIED CHICKEN!!! So the over exaggeration of food by Japanese people is the realest thing you’ve ever said
Hahah that bit with Connor in the trunk was amazing 😂😂
You can also have more babies with alcohol!
6:20 bruh they don't look that bad, if anything do introduce me
I'm so lucky to have a business visa and I can't wait to visit Japan for the second time. I'm going to explore Kanazawa and Okinawa!
Someone's very brave for revealing that photo to the world :P Gotta say that ending montage was badass. You got this Chris!
Unbearable...how so? I don't get it...could someone explain it to me??
I saw Markiplier
woah! chris got destroyed like a sandbag xD But great effort!
Abroad in a Pan would be hilarious ! Film Chris cooking and then have Uncle Roger react to the video.
9:24 "yes please, do it again, in mouth"
Badass montage at the end. Keep up the hard work mate. From Mount Fuji to as hot as an onsen lol
Congrats on 10 years of having a YouTube channel that people still gravitate toward. You're kind of a modern-day Lafcadio Hearn to me. I enjoy your stories about Japan. It keeps Japan in my thoughts, though the last time I was there was maybe 15 years ago...
Broad in a sweat.
5:10 ahh, you are turning into some kind of Ryotaro, with more evil plans
I love Abroad in Japan!! The most fun I have with realistic knowledge, not western ideas of Japan from some random turd from America.
going on some kinda youtuber boxing ticket? :) gl, worked out for idubz
Props on the active lifestyle Chris, hope all is well with the diet and exercise! Trying to do the same in my early 30s too
your next ask abroad is prob going to be an existential crisis inducing one...
If you do commit to a xmas carol special. It must involve puppets. Also yes, we want this.
Just as the video started I thought “has he lost weight?”. Good for you Chris! You can see it in your face. Keep it going mate.
Yes to the Christmas carol, But can we have Connor as Scrooge?
Release all the footage of the Ken Watanabe video. U spent a week u said with him for like such a short video. Do itttttt.
頑張れ! Getting fit isn’t easy so all the best. 50% of slimming down is actually the good you eat. Of course Sport already improves your constitution but the effects are often not fully visible if you don’t combine it with a diet (as in food intake routine not 3-apples a day bungee bullshit). Also Not sleeping enough and being less stressed can be the final reason why one cannot get rid of their muffin top. But generally: it is a day-by-day journey and sometimes your body is just not in the same constitution as the day before - it is not a step back; just part of the journey.  People not born with the right „physiques“, have to work very hard to achieve them, so no one should be judging them based on there appearances alone anyway.   Stay strong! 😊
Training with your dad. Nice. 😉
Congrats on your 10 yr anniversary! You should ask your Patrons on your paetron channel to pay for your re-make of A Christmas Carol. I see Natsuke as the ghost of Christmas past, Shar being the ghost of Christmas present, Joey as Bob Crochet and you as Scrooge.
I would love to see a Abroad in Japan Christmas Carol!
Do a samurai day training it would be great dude
For me the biggest problem is simply the missing motivation to do some fitness related. I know I'd have to do some but I judt dont
I would definitely watch the Abroad in Japan Christmas Carol
Chris YouTube boxing yes please god let it happen
I want to thank you Chris for all your work, your videos bring me so much joy and my daughter and I watch one of your videos as soon as it comes out!
Chris Vs Connor boxing match when?
14:00 Just play Yakuza: Like a Dragon.  It explains what a soapland in a pretty good way showing both sides... you know, of making soap.
Mr. Abroad in Japan, please please do Chrismas carol series.  But not without Natsky
10:25 false! The most cinematic thing you've ever shot was the thing with Natsuki in the latest Journey Across Japan, where he owes some gangster money
See I didn't watch those videos sure to the thumbnail and click baityness
Now u have to go to the school. Gj. Or are u big brain and just giving a hint st future content. 🤔
9:25
I really feel like it has nothing to do with covid anymore. It's all about politics :(
My son has moved to Japan - looks nothing like you Pewds looks nothing like you haahaha..
Chris why did u do Sharla so dirty tho? 😅
Bet this is what Chris was editing in the car while mr C-Dog was waiting
Mad respect for you brother 😎
I’d love to watch abroad in a pan
There's something ridiculous about the government telling people to drink more alcohol (which weakens your immune system) while refusing to open the country because they're worried about rising covid numbers. Mad.
Mr.K1 Pride fighter really took you to the ring on that one. good work chris , keep it up and don't give up.
Can this comment get pined? Marking the next 10 years to this channel.
Congratulations on your 10 years of YouTube! Your channel has been a staple of good entertainment and fantastic cinematography during all these years, and here's to hoping it will continue to be so for many years to come.  Just a question for the non-上手, when you mentioned the name of the sake, you mentioned it meant "Garden of Nightingales", but couldn't it also mean "The Nightingale in the garden"? As in "Piano no mori", using の as in "substantive の place" to indicate something that exists in a place. Purely out of curiosity and a desire to learn!
How Chris won't admit that the true reason behind his wish to get fit is Canadian. ☺
"YOU WILL BE SAVAGED BY BEARS" - I like a sign that doesn't muck about
I would love to see Chris sign up for the next creator clash. Think it would be fun and a good way to work towards that fitness goal
9:20 - 9:29 got a new soundbite for my collection. Thanks.
Connor seemed to like captivity a bit much... Seriously, I enjoy your work so if you guys do explore out in bear country, wear some bear bells. Here in New Mexico bears only get aggressive if they have cubs with them or if they are hungry and or cornered. Japan's bears just appear to be aggressive all the time for no reason. Bells, bells... 🙄
I'd love to see a Christmas carol should be a fun watch please go for it!
Damn that montage was lit
Just here to appreciate the masterful editing in the fitness montage of syncing the punches to the music
Nice Q&A !  Yes please, do it again in my mouth ! - Abroad in Japan,2022 😂
10 years of great content on a great channel with a great host! thank you 🙏🏻
Weight loss is 90% in the kitchen, 10% in the gym. Good luck chap 👍
I have never backed anything on patreon or any crowdfunding platform before  BUT   I would work overtime for a whole month and put the money towards an Abroad in Japan Christmas Carol!!!
I wanna see an abroad in Japan workout series
15:55 boing boing boing boing sorry chris, keep up the good work
Why did you have to do your Mrs dirty like that, Chris? Hilarious, though.
I finally could afford to go to Japan in early 2020 and still can’t go 🙁
abroad in Japan a christmas carol it is lets gooo, I dare you
Is it still worth trying for the JET Programme? (Its how i originally came accross your channel :) Been thinking about it on and off over the years heh.
unironically I want to see any movie you would make. please please! your regular videos and documentaries have beautiful shots, and I'm sure any movie you make would also look amazing "nobody appreciates" your shots? well, I appreciate them every time
It sounds like closing the country permanently to foreigners would be a good idea, devaluing the currency would be of great benefit to domestic industry. It might be good to stop English as a school subject as it is rather ineffective anyway. The focus of all political will should then be on the birth rate issue, which I'm sure will necessitate changes to social structure away from the current shallow imitation of the western model, given that many western countries have the same problem but worse and merely extend it through mass immigration the West should really stop pretending it has any authority on the matter, all their suggestions to date do not propose a solution but rather digging the hole deeper while fundamentally deracinating the country and destroying it's unique culture and heritage to become another corporate outpost with little defining identity and the wage and cultural suppression of the majority population. The West is fundamentally not a good model to build states off of anymore. Japan would be better served to forge it's own path and limit foreign influence until something like the 30 years war settles them down again and means that you won't just be importing problems.
So... Chris Broad for creator clash 2?? Boxing is very healthy, and the motivation to work harder so you don't get punched in the face would surely help keep up the training :P
"Yes please. Do it again, in my mouth" -Chris Broad 2022
Excellent montage with Nicholas Lettuce
That was a good montage, more please.
You know... I really do hope Japan opens up and its economy bounces back... but like... anime figures are soooo cheap right now.
Chris is readying himself up for Creator Clash 2.0. He's feeling the FOMO. 😂
I was kinda put off by recent clickbaity thumbnails, good to know you doesn't like them too :D (I've watched these videos later on, content was great!)
Yes i want a christmas movie made from you Chris. It's going to be awsome i know it.
Japan had (and maybe still has?) the highest number of cases in the world recently, in spite of its isolationist policy towards tourism. It has continued to cripple its tourism industry unnecessarily. In my opinion if they want to exercise caution they should only grant visas to travellers with travel insurance.
You kinda remind me of Charlie Brooker when he had a show called screenwipe on BBC4. It was a great show. The similarity I see is your sense of humour and a great way of breaking things down for us idiots. I watch your stuff all the time. Well done on your success.
Really we need Connor and Ryotaro in the same video; both Abroad in Japan Saga villains uniting to ruin Abroad Man's day
PLEASE make the Abroad In Japan Christmas Carol!!! I need it in my life. Give us this Christmas Miracle!
Let’s go Rocky!!! Eye of the 🐅
The affable man has got a new haircut. Nice.
YES!! Please do the Christmas carol it is my favorite Christmas movie.
Little worried, Chris predict Brexit would never happen so not liking odds on Japan opening this year.
covid is the biggest scamm ever made, just to give goverments totalitarian control over the population
Dont eat to escape, eat for a goal in mind. Helps me for when Im trying to reach my own fitness goals
WHERE'S THE REST OF THE OKINAWA VIDEOS
@7:55 I don't know Christ I think they trying look the good of things but if they don't like something they say it see if you and them are in agreement but if not they move on because natski he's very open if he dose not like something I notice that of him and Ryotaro too, soo I don't think your really correct on that. Just saying they not being dishonest about that they just understand why I mean look Logan Paul he got knock out of country lol for what he did soo yah. Love your videos Chris and been watching you on twitch keep up good work☺️.
Fitness montage? More like Hajime no Ippo in real life!
Just went to a an abandoned japanese school in Yunni Hokkaido yesterday! 😆 theres a walrus taxidermy in it so it would be worth checking out on your trip!!
super latives are the best sort of latives
I think the cycling is really going to help your fitness. I started road cycling in 2020 and since then I've dropped 13kilos and its helped my mindset immensely as well.  Keep it up Chris, all the riding is going to make you stronger and fitter for sure.
If you're American and deal with Kodiaks up in Alaska, Hokkaido brown bears are less of a threat in comparison. Still be weary of all wildlife no matter the location or species. Great video as always Mr. Broad
the Connor kidnapped skit was ace content rofl
Love “Hate mail of the week.” 😂😂🤣
«Don’t be an influencer! Be a filmmaker, be a photographer, be an artist!… Take a passion in the craft first and foremost!”  Yes! That’s a good one! Many YouTubers tend to forget why are they here, using that platform for.
Video starts at 18:00. You're welcome. Before that he talks about random useless stuff
Nice Kim Jong Dong haircut!
Love how your 10-year video features the 2 loves of your life -Connor and Sharla! 😂
Good luck with your goals! Love your videos uwu owo
Oh snap i finally caught a new abroad in japan video
Thank you so much for all that you do, Chris! Re: having to go by what works on Youtube: I am subscribed and clearly a fan, but I could not bring myself to view the new "Japan's $$$ villa" and "Japan's $$$ yacht" videos yet. I know you and all the other cool people star in them, but the titles were just too repulsive to me. Maybe it is an age thing, who knows...
As half Japanese, who has grown up in Japan, I personally do not like tourists Especially American tourists No manners, no respect for Japan  Countless times they scream and shout, don't follow rules No disrespect, but southerners are the worst You often hear, "why is there no English signs here, why are there no french fries in this traditional Japanese restaurant!!!" The one I hate more than anything to The point I wanna kill them is....  We own this country!
That 'fitness instructor' is way fatter than Chris !
:(((
Be careful posting boxing footage KSI will be contacting you to put you on he's next boxing card 🤣. I'm happy to hear you are training again. Invest in yourself it's the best thing you can do, you're worth it man you're a legend 🙂
open the country. stop having it be closed.
Lol, he’s actually complimenting Cannur. It really is the end of the world.
Abroad in Japan christmas carol?  Yes.
This ad felt like a joke... "Japanese government is crazy to push people to drink more, haha, anyway but seriously buy this wine. Now. I’s good."
this might sound a bit weird, but I appreciate hearing how much you dislike your own titles and thumbnails. I was actually quite behind on watching your videos for a while because every time I see one of those titles or thumbnails I would think “that sounds too clickbaity, and I’m not interested” and then I wouldn’t click. I kept having to remind myself that “wait, isn’t Abroad in Japan doing a new Journey Across Japan series?” And then I’d end up clicking the video.  I understand why you do it, but I’m definitely on your side that I’d rather see video titles and thumbnails that lean away from that, heh.
This video comes out and only yesterday they announced they will let more people in again starting 7th of September and you can also do the unguided tours now via travel agency, still not fully open but at least another step in the right direction although a slow one. still funny with the timing of the video 🤣
I have a similar body type. I've been wildly fit many times in my life but never slim. Until I tried IF and Keto. You might want to look into it, but speaking from experience I know that can be hard in Japan.
Question to all, Chris says he's a Christmas man but I'm a Halloween fan🍻 what are you?
Keep up the hard work! Cut the milk and cheese!! Drink oat milk. Check the  protein to fat ratio on what you eat. Can’t wait to see your transformation!!!!
I honestly think your thumbnails are perfect for showing what will happen in the video and getting your attention. Great work!
😂😂 most sarcastic man alive!
After this training Chris might be starring in "Abroad in a Creator Clash!"  All jokes aside, keep it up buddy!  You are helping yourself for tomorrow and for the rest of your life!
Congratulations on the 10-year anniversary! Still a pleasure to see your videos!
13:35 Best scene in the episode
Now if the japanese government wants more alcohol to be drunk it should open the country for us Georgians
PLEASE DO THE CHRISTMAS CAROL VIDEO OH MY GOD YES
A Christmas carol starring natsuki, ryotaro, Connor, Joey and Chris as Scrooge, that's enough of a justification right there to produce it.
What if there are ghost bears tho? 🤷🏽‍♂️
The weirdest thing about that 'lock the door' toilet sign is that it is a woman walking in on a dude. Wouldn't she have first had to ignore the pretty obvious sign outside first?
Clearly they're waiting for me to get my passport renewed.
Affable 😎
I guess chris will be in the next creator clash?
Did He realy say:"Do it again,in my mouth"? 🥴
9:25 ayooooo 😂
Christmas special with Ken Watanabe as Santa. And the Natsuki walks in as a Santa with a cig in his mouth apologizing for being late and then seeing Mr. Watanabe! And Dr. Jelly pops out of a present showing off some new product, Dr. Jelly's Cranberry Jelly or something.  Well.. that escalated.. :p
When do you think the border will be open for tourists who don't want to do and organised tour
Connor is Batman!!!!
Please please pleeeeeaaaas I need the Abroad in Japan christmas Carol!  With Natsuki Ryotaro and Sharla as the Ghosts, the Trash Taste Boys  Pete, Emma… and of course you as Ebenezer Scrooge Pleeeeeaaaaseee 🥺
07:09 These shots. Fucking love these shots.
What a dumb policy by Japan.
What better way to boost alcohol tax than letting a bunch of brits in 😂😂 probably make headway on the old population problem while we’re at it
I'm so glad I found working holiday visas. I've basically just been a restriction free tourist in Japan for the last 2 months and it feels a little bit like cheating!
please do it chris
Ah no wonder you looked better in this video. I thought it was some fancy editing, but you put in the actual work! I noticed ! Well done sir!
I noticed in the boxing montage that you’re boxing like a right hander even though you’re left handed Chris. Kinda odd.
I appreciate the fitness montage at the end. Additionally, now we know the other job that Nicholas Petas from Junkfood Japan has, namely tormenting Chris Broad into shape.   Keep up the good work. Don't overdo it with challenging yourself physically. Keep it steady and balanced.
Wishing ya the best of luck on that training course good sir!  Curious as to whom this photographer friend of yours is 🤔
The way you say christmas carol sounds like christmas cow and I can't help but giggle at the thought of a christmas cow
Yeah, while travelling around Japan in 2020 & 2021, I was surprised at the number of Japanese I met who assumed I was an ordinary tourist on a visit, and were completely unaware that foreigners were not allowed to enter the country, even if they had a home there.
What's with the Kim Jong Un haircut?
chris vs connor in the next creator clash?
I love seeing people improve their health. Keep at it Chris! We believe in you!
Glad you started a fitness journey mate keep it up :), Doing awesome!
No!   No Xmas Aboard Carol!  Please No!
"I self taught myself" mhmmm
OMG do it again, in my mouth -Chris Abroad in Japan
When you say "anniversary" is it when you and YouTube started dating or after you guys got married?? What anniversary are we talking here😂😂😂😂😂HI Natsuki!!
ABROAD IN JAPAN CHRISTMAS CAROL LETS GO!
5:17 Chris, hope that couch is cushy,Aubrey pick up an extra pillow?
Yes, please. The people need Abroad in Japan: A Christmas Carol. Please.
@AbroadInJapan   Chris has inspired me to take my course to get my bachelors and my plan is to join the jet program in 3 years and teach in Japan , hopefully it goes well and thank you Chris for inspiring me! Love your videos and hoping I can buy you a drink in 3 years time! Thank you for inspiring me to take my ALT journey and hopefully it all works out, Thank you!
You should definitely force everyone to do the christmas carol film with you
Shout out to Connor for actually staying back there for 2 days to add more realism to the bit
I would not open the borders…..  right now Covid is the worst for Japan they’ve ever seen but sadly it seems the government is folding under pressure of corporate tycoons.  Around 300 dying daily over 2 million people infected with Covid in Japan right now.
With that pun it makes me wonder if you're gonna be a dad soon! 😂
Your bicycle adventure with Connor has inspired me to get a bicycle for myself.  Not sure Okinawa is going to be as enjoyable to bike as Hokkaido, but I'll make the most of it.  Thanks for the motivation!
Easy fix to get alcohol consumption up - open the country! Us Aussie tourists will be more than happy to help with that goal.
Ha.. you look nothing like Connor! So that comment that you look like every white guy is busted🤣
It's actually kind of refreshing to have a youtuber say that they don't like those kind of thumbnails/titles
Yo that montage was SICK! Keep it up man!
do it
I know I'll get buried in but i think the journey across japan original season had potential. If you redid it and took your time and didn't rush video's out and edited afterwards i think a revisit of it months long would be nice. I do however fully realize it's a massive undertaking and time consuming feat for the channel and extremely taxing on you. I do realize it's probably not worth it for the channel as well as being incredibly taxing on chris himself.
fabulous, boxing is indeed very English
My workplace (Kyoto Uni) still prohibits overseas travel.. stone age mentality
You look great, Chris!  I love the fitness montage at the end - it's quite inspiring!  More of that, please.  Hang in there!
Japan's best years were in the 1980's
13:50 LMFAO!!!
More videos with Sharla!! Also does Natsuki cut your hair? You always have sich haircuts.
get yourself the garbage bag suit
A Carol from Abroad, sounds great
I would enjoy an abroad in Japan BTS. Like production work, how Chris plans his shots and how he uses his cameras and drones. Chris could do a skillshare class on this and I'd watch it. Hell if it's only possible to go to Japan I'd love to work for you dude
That 80's exercise montage - I was expecting, "I have a bad case of diarrhea..."
do it !!! Chris&Conner vs bear lol
I haven't watched many of the recent videos because of the twatty titles/thumbnails. Unsettling to hear even you don't like the algorithm game.
there's a lot of haikyo content there in japan mostly target building, park or houses that usually haunted.
U rock ❤️✌️we love u
yes. pls make christmas carol abroad in japan edition. stretch them film making muscles
That photo of Sharla! 🤣😂
Japan literally rather make their economy go in a circular transitive dependency of alcoholism and drunkards than to open up their borders  Damn, the old people mindset is wild
13:35  Killer Chris: Origin
I love the voice you use when you read the comments.
MAKE THE CHRIMUSS
That's not how superlative is pronounced, Chris.
Yup, from what I’ve seen in cities like Yokohama Tokyo, Okinawa and others close to American and other country military bases. Don’t notice that tourists aren’t coming because of all the military and students living here.
I think Japan is doing the right thing by being careful, really. A lot of the attitude in the west is now to "forget about it" and just end up getting sick as an inevitability. Ideally we get better vaccines and all the nasty strains get killed off and life can truly go back to normal
These expressions on youtube thumbnails only make me recoil in horror.
Great shots of Kyoto. And I fully agree with you, that the city has to be experienced without the tourist crowds.
Wait is Chris broad going to be in creator clash 2??!?
That montage was really good! I loved the synced-up hits too!
Just read an article about how non-tour group tourist may be allowed to come starting in Sept. My tourist free pictures we be a nice memory.
Mf really getting the chad jawline damn
oh christ I hope you get a proper bicycle this time... has it been 10 years!? I hopped on 5 years ago... I can't believe it was 2 years ago since the last Q n A... Glad you are still around, Sir!
Good luck with the fitness goals! I'll be curious how it all works out. I myself tried exercise and fitness for weight loss, but ending up gaining weight. Then calorie tracking, which was too easy to keep neglecting. Lately, it's been fasting, which has worked EXCELLENT. But the downside is, yeah, hunger. Pros and cons. Pros and cons. :)
Congrats on 10 Years Youtube, i wish you even more success in the future
A fitness montage - WHERE IS THE UNSUBSCRIBE BUTTON _ QUICK!!!!!!
You guys should do remakes of popular movies. You could do cinematic scenes with almost-professional actors and effects.
Hay British Guy.  If you were a legume what legume would you be?   Philosophy 101 👍
100 years from today people will look back and wonder, how did people live, how did people enjoy life. And they will see one of your video's! Ride the cloud brother!
Abroad in Japan Christmas Carol? That's a yes!!! 🎄
“Do it again! In my mouth!”  -Chris Broad; 2022
I love these q and a videos, thank you for the entertainment. As a professional cook who just turned 41, i too find that the physicality of my work is definitely something that i can no longer take for granted. Though i do not have much time for extra exercise i try to walk at least one mile each day and exercise with weights and do yoga for 15 minutes. Much luck to you, it is certainly not easy and there are one million and one reasons to procrastinate; however it only takes one yes to commit to exercise. Much luck to you on your journey and I look forward to many more videos in the future.
"Yes, please! Do it again in my mouth!" ... I'm going to use that line.
I avoided your 3000$, or any money in the thumbnails and the other day I watched one and is just a good video of you hangin' out with the boys, the money in the thumbnail is not relevant until the middle of the video, so because the stupid thubnail for clicks meta,almost lost on watching a good video.
Having a healthy diet is always the key even if u don't go to gym and work out as long as u minimize ur calorie intake and eat the right foods like complex carbs which is vegetables and fruits while avoiding simple carbs like bread and sugary foods or beverages. It will definetly lead to a healthy life style. Even if u work out but eat unhealthy foods its pretty much useless in the end.
I wasn't paying attention to the screen and I kept hearing "Christmas cow" 😅🤣🤣🤣
Yes please a Christmas carol
i like eating poo when i watch these chris
You've got the same body type as Elon Musk, there's no shame in that.
Love you Chris! awesome video as always!
25:34 After seeing this amazing training montage, I'm very excited for the for the tournament arc.
"Japanese yen, Bordering worthless" -  *Laughs in Australian Dollar*
"Don't go here you will be savaged by bears" signs have a completely different feeling in San Francisco...
You should participate in a body building competition 😆
Christmas in Japan (in Hokkaido since the snow and yeah! lol)
You’re a great filmmaker! Your Fukushima and Stories from the tsunami are some of the best I’ve seen on the subjects. You’re going places!
Honestly, that workout montage was very inspiring! Makes me want to start working out more consistently now since I just had a doctor's visit and have found that I am the heaviest I have ever been (199 lbs)!
so affable......there seems to be some benefit in the word appearing, so I contributed one for you!
Please make an Abroad in channel for all Southeast / East Asian countries.
“I like sake. Especially when it's served at the correct temperature, 98.4 degrees Fahrenheit, like this is.” - James Bond
Hey there. Long time viewer, first time commenter (I think lol)   After watching that workout montage at the end, it would be pretty dope if you did the Creator Clash 2 boxing for charity against CDawg!   Mayhaps? Pwease!? uwu thanks! :x
Influencer is such a dumb name!
Chris, Pewdiepie is in Japan, have you consider to do a collab with him other than just hanging out? like travelling maybe?
Awesome video! I would love a Christmas video!
Great video Chris! You're already looking a lot better and more physically fit, keep up the wonderful journey. As if your videos weren't already an inspiration to us all, they just shot up even further!
Please, PLEASE do an Abroad in Japan Christmas Carol!!! 😂
10 years. Hell yeah
Cute that you showed a picture of Sharla in your 3 pics. Especially since she asked the question. Double cute!
No Sound :(
This video just reminded me of how fat I've gotten over the last 2.5 years in my 30s. Time to shed some weight by picking up the weights.
Training and exercising can only get you so far. I’d love to see you do a 6-month challenge of not eating fried chicken! Or one month no drinking alcohol.
9:26 do what in your mouth Chris? Kinda sus.
Take all the time you need if you ever need a break, but just so you know you look pretty great to me.
Japanese Black Bears are very similar to American Black Bears. While not foolproof, the best stratagy is to stand tall and scream at them. Obviously as long as you are no where near a momma bear and its cubs. Unless it is during a drought they are usually Herbervors. You aren't on the menu.
If it helps, I will always click on every single video you ever post.
Chris (to chef):ohhhh Do it again! In my mouth!
The only thing I could give Chris shit for is that he's a Mac user.
Dawg….. you’re a white guy in Japan. You’re literally suppose to be bigger than everyone else.
Ippo?
Vegas was pretty awesome in Dec 2020 and Jan 2021
Chris,   What are your thoughts on direct doxastic voluntarism and the internalism/externalism debate in epistemology, and do you think that certain beliefs are properly basic, especially those grounded in experience. Also, do you believe in phenomenal conservatism. I would love to hear your thoughts on these philosophical questions.
🤣🤣🤣 the Sharla pic
Good for you man - tackle it in your 30s and your 40s will feel even better!
It cracks me up that the government thinks drinking more alcohol 🍺 will solve this crisis of bad economy from closed borders. I guess I better start swapping more money over. I wonder how much longer Japan can take.
As much as I want to see an Abroad In Japan Christmas Carol, I am not sure if Chris will come out the other side of editing in tact.  Edit: P.S. Do it anyway.
Love your work. Thumbnails, to me, don't matter as much once I know the quality and style of the creator. I will watch pretty much anything you or other creators I follow
Thank you for the interesting Q&A, and good on you for focusing on what's important to you.
Congrats on 10 years in Japan!!! I am extremely fortunate to be living in Japan after painfully waiting for two years and I hope to stay for a long while. That training looked really cool and inspiring! Keep up the good work!!
Have you ever thought of creating a seperate channel that allows you to create a different type of content? For example I really liked the little film you created about Maro that was posted on Twitter. I'm really curious of the type of content you think about but never produce because of the constraints of maybe not being about japan.
Honestly, Covid hasn't gone away just because it's been a bit over 2.5 years since the first few cases.  Given the number of senior citizens I can legitimately see why Japan is being extra cautious.  It sucks for the tourists, but...first blame goes to the virus.
A stomach like Mount Fuji wouldn't be so bad if the clouds are included.
Thanks for all you do. Now dumb question. Someone accused me of cultural appropriation for saying " Arigato Gazaimasu  senpai or sensei". I think our modern languages are all taken from other languages in one way or another. What do you think? Love what you do and do what you love. Thank You.😅😂
Your cinematography is AMAZINNNNGGG!!!! I always think the way you structure your shots and create the stories of your videos are super well paced and add to the over all narrative.  I loved the scene where you panned out and showed the emptiness of the island being abandoned. As a viewer it really made me feel the isolation of the place. I find it really interesting what when you showed friends the shots, they felt that way.  It's so funny there was an episode where you and Joey took photos of this European looking place and you made the voters choose which photo they liked more... I remember seeing both the photos and saying, "Wow! Chris's photo is so technically beautiful! But I love the concept of Joey's photo. So I couldn't pick between the two."  I'm honestly jealous of the students you taught. I'd love to learn from you! Do you plan on maybe releasing an online course in the future? :D
One vote for Christmas sketch here
Sharla: show us 3 photos never seen before. Chris: here's the 1st picture... Sharla: so you have chosen death.
Interesting video , also just my 2 cents but I actually never mind your thumbnails ..   Eitherway keep up the good work your an inspiration to alot of us.
COVID lockdowns and restrictions fkd the economy
Abroad in a Pan where Chris (attempts to) cooks Japanese dishes with guests would be nice
A series of Wacky Weekend episodes that is Christmas Carol themed. 5 episodes, prologue, the three ghosts, and epilogue on Christmas!  That or a Christmas Carol Journey Across Japan.
You better have Kaho and Connor in your christmas carol documentary just to make it more awkward xD
Dude, that advice to the son wanting to be a youtuber is so genuine and realistic
I like how Chris is inspiring people to get into shape but he inspires me to try to make better videos
It's not the "wow face" it is a SOY FACE. Call it what it is!
Looking forward to seeing this fitness journey! One tip that helped me was raising my protein intake to over 120g a day. I worked out for years without much real gains. As soon I learned this and started doing it daily, the results showed really fast and kept growing 👍
3:44 Chris actually used the Last of Us theme damn... Love the attention to detail
10 years of disappointment and despair. Congrats on the milestone.
As a pt, I love seeing someone deciding enough is enough and really getting into their fitness journey. Good effort there at the end Chris!
Chris said Super-Latives. 🤯
Why do you pronounce it super•lay•teev?
You mean other than British Baking shows right? Those are always OOOOVERLY positive to the point of nauseum.
Sorry chris I'm going to roast you.... is that hair cut to commemorate the new bevis and butt head film... your cup must be a milinial rebellion as to what dosent last a generation. Is that  stir fry sauce on the counter is it good.
Sharla is photogenic even in bad lighting.
Thanks for speaking out about the Japanese government's policies. As a student who lost a $25,000 scholarship and the opportunity to study in Japan for a year i appreciate you using your platform to inform others
Your fitness montage is too high def to be 80s :P
Ok Chris Two things; 1st of all props for doing crunches all the way, so many people raise their neck 3 inches off the ground and are like 'crunches don't do anything for me' and cry about it. SECOND of all; Im dissapointed your montage is lacking critical features of a 80's training Montague such as randomly looking at sunrises, your child sneaking out of the house to hang with people cus you're suddenly not cool enough for them, and some sort of abstract workout a la karate kid's wax on wax off; or Rocky's punching frozen carcasses at a butcher shop.
Omg i would Abroad in a Pan!!!!
I commend you and I wish you all the luck in attaining your goal of a healthier you.  👍🙏👏👏👏👏👏👏😎🏋🏻
Nice man.  Congrats.  You're seriously an inspiration.
I was going to tell you I was the fittest in my 40's when I did an easier version of Crossfit and you should go see Nicholas. I see you've taken my advice without it being my advice.
Hey Chris, we definitely appreciate those drone shots establishing the theme of the story.  They are fantastic, thank you!
you say you are not in the best of shape but at 85kg for your height ? i have the same weight as you but im just 160cm and i look like a fuckin baloon ffs you look way better than i ever will be
We need the Abroad in Japan Christmas Carol 🎄
Japanese elite encouraging people to drink more alcohol furthers the global depopulation agenda and accelerates the rapid decline in Japanese birth rates. They only want uncivil populations breeding more so they have more easily controlled tax slaves.
That Sharla pic killed me
Creator clash 2023.... i think eo!
What are your thoughts on Shinto and how it impacts modern Japanese Society?
I've always seen you as a huge inspiration (maybe in part because I'm also from Kent) and I do hope visas open up sometime soon because it's so frustrating to see the government dance around and sidestep such an obvious solution to their predicament.
I watch a ton of cooking shows on here as well (and fail ones like Without a Recipe, so fun) and I'd 100% watch Abroad in a Pan--I was already hooked with the White Day episode.
plum wine tast test 🍷
Don't sweat the haters. I'm standing by for the the Japanese government to give the go ahead. The group tours are for mainland Chinese with no etiquette.
Chris nice montage, I kind of missed the obligatory stairs scene like in rocky xD. Good luck.
Do A Christmas Carol! But don't get burned out.
Have you considered your final resting place? Getting cremated in Japan or buried in the UK?
Fan  casting for Abroad in Japan presents: A Christmas Carol -  Scrooge- Chris Ghost of Christmas Past- Natsuki Ghost of Christmas Present- Joey Ghost of Christmas Future- Ryotaro Tiny Tim- Connor Bob Cratchet- Garnt? Young Scrooge (for the past)- Ironmouse Jacob Marley- Pete
Is it just me or does that look like Chris's dad in the end of the vid training with him 🤔
Ok I can’t help it  0:28 “Ask A Broad “  Chris really did choose a cool pun unintentionally.
I would legit pay to watch an abroad in Christmas carol
Me- "Why didn't Chris answer the soapland question??" *looks it up ... Oh. That's why. >_>
is this going to be another video where the comment section barks on about how xenophobic the Japanese are ... Because quite frankly the comments are layered with bigotry and miss representation of the Japanese and their culture. Just so you know, if you think the Japanese are racist ... your the reason there like that ... Arrogant westerners forcing your ideals onto others. a majority of western tourists have zero respect for other cultures. you come into a country ... Get Drunk, try to bone every girl you can, barely learn the language and expect everyone to adjust to your liking. then get pissy when the locals get sick of you. "but i'm not like that" you already are by commenting on a video about how Xenophobic you think the locals are.
Chris… What is the meaning of life? Is it indeed 42?
Ngl, i actually started training recently again Ive been wanting to get healthier so it's cool to see someone else also on the same journey
Congrats on your 10th Year! Your amazing video's are my morning tea, your channel is both exciting and refreshing. Thank you so much for being on. You  and associates click like a fine clock. Watching your channel in the late hours in California has become a ritual form me now. Three thumbs up!👍👍👍! Keep them coming!
Looking slimmer Chris! I loved the video and was incredibly engaging. The COVID lockdowns and Japan's hardline conservative approach has significantly changed my life here in America. I had almost everything lined up to attend school in Japan just prior to COVID. I sunk the latter half of my highschool years prepping for that moment, practically making it a life goal to move to Japan especially with the inspiration of your videos. As a now 22 year old, I can see the woes of my rose tinted glasses. Thanks to your videos, it is still the goal, but I would be lying if I wasn't feeling a little alienated especially since I sunk so much of myself into it. I look forward to Japan returning to normal and rekindle my ambitions. Thank you Chris!
Congrats on 10 years, Chris! All the best on your fitness and welbeing journey 😄
Do it.
12:45 is the best facial expression I have ever seen in this channel
I've a bit, just a bit, of a feeling that you saw the lengthy comment I gave on the bungee jumping video with Connor the other day before I deleted it (saying I was so worried about him letting go of the side ropes when crossing the bridge) Because here he was again, acting like he was in trouble, being left in a car tied up and gagged for 24 hours. lol Ugh. I was so shocked I barely heard anything else you said the rest of the video. (The reason  I deleted the last message on the bungee trip the next morning was because it looked a bit long winded and messy, though in retrospect it was sort of funny and I could have just edited it instead.)
So you want a challenge? How about running through bear country with a backpack full of marshmallows?
I'm a random watcher of Chris and this is the 9:46 first time i actually heard him speak a sentence in japanese lol
Lol 13:57 when I read that I busted out laughing EDIT: I've been SO looking forward to the next video in the JAJ series! When will it come out?
Let me innn, LET ME INNNNN
I suggest joining Nebula if you have ideas that you can't or don't want to do on YouTube
I love the Muppet Christmas caroll! That would be one hell of a fun project
Stopped watching after that Sharla picture. I will forever be traumatized
Have been watching you for years now and I finally get to go to Japan through MEXT! You helped me kind of experience things I could never even if I went, so I really like your content. It's kinda sad that you have to make those off-putting clickbait titles. I understand why, and I know that I'll be interested in your video, but those clickbaits make me hesitate to click tbh. Even this video. If I knew it was a QnA I would have watched it 3 hours ago when you posted. Although you make those titles and thumbnails, you never fail to amaze us, with the quality of the actual video. Keep up the good work, glad to hear that you still like making films and videos!
Chris I'm from the UK and my girlfriend is Japanese. We are waiting for Japan to open so we can visit. I want to explore as much as possible so can you recommend me places to see or stuff I should prepare for before coming? Both currently living in Australia!
that connor bit had me dead.. hahaha ~
OH MY GOD YES! I swear the Muppet’s Christmas Carol doesn’t get enough love I bring it up every year how it’s the best adaptation yet.
I haven't even noticed that your titles are clickbait because when I see you have uploaded a new video I know it's going to be good.  It's not clickbait if you deliver,  and you always deliver.
Damn… you might be a better boxer than me..
It’s a Chris-mas Carol
Loving your videos mate, but get to the point ! Am skipping chapters to 17:49, just to get answers to the posted title...
Nice work Chris for getting into health
Chris at the very end has the same expression I do after exercising. 🥵
Also here for 6 years and mate that over acting really can not handle it…
i need an abroad in japan xmas carol. my life depends on it, chris. get busy.
sharla is pretty even in her "bad" photos lol
Do the Xmas special, we want it!!!
Dude that fitness montage was badass.  So glad to see you getting in shape.   Keep it up.
Aw, the teasing of Sharla has begun, now I know it's serious ❤️
Regarding the Clickbait thumbnails: I understand and respect what you have to do to keep your channel running. I would humbly request that you just put a tiny graphic up in one of the top corners of the thumbnail, just videos in a series. I use the YouTube app on my phone exclusively and even if you note the series name in the title, if it’s at the end, I basically won’t see it because YouTube cut off the title after a certain number of characters.   You wouldn’t necessarily even have to use the whole name, like for your current series, you could just do “JAJ: Ep. 2”   Just makes things easier to visually sort, find the right videos
The Kyoto toilet art man actually looks like a caricature of Chris himself 😂
abroad in japan christmas carol -- PUHLEEZ!!  with a cherry on top.
Team up with @Mrwhostheboss and get healthy!
Mediocre YouTuber eh...? Ask them where they hid their 2,71 million subscribers...  Grats on 10 years! Push it for 10 more! And 10 more!! :D
ill take a video of Chris drinking sake and telling stories any day.
Abroard In A Pan cooking show :D
Chris posts an unflattering picture of his girlfriend.   I see you, too, like to live dangerously…
It might have just been lucky timing or really just "early on" in 2020, but as a foreign resident I've been able to go back home to Europe for each Christmas since coming here in Jan 2020
Chris about to get lean and mean
Congrats with 10 years on YouTube!! About the thumbnails and titles, I personally don't really mind it. The thumbnails are nice to look at :D
I’m sure your soon to be ex-girlfriend will LOVE that you included that photo of her to your 2 million subscribers
Keeping tourists out is utterly pointless from a covid/safety perspective. It's like having dirty floors then never allowing guests into your house because you're afraid they might track in dirt. Japan, just like every other country on the planet, has covid already. They're not preventing anything. Early in the pandemic it made sense, but the cat's out of the bag now. The xenophobia is strong in Japan.
Bloody hell..
hawt montage.
Sharla is going to kill you for that photo.
Let me iiiiiiin!!!
6:00 you laugh about a sign that tells you to lock the toilet door , but just yesterday some idiot forgot to lock the door on the toilet of a restaurant and I opened the door just to find him puking. Seems to be a thing here in Kyoto!
Have you ever changed a dine in order to take-out to avoid temptation to tell the staff it was terrible, and toss it later and dining elsewhere?
As someone who's first hero was Oscar the Grouch and who was called Eeyore by family, positivity might be the hardest thing for me.
What was the name of the hotel you stayed at in your most recent video?
I know you hate the word "influencer", Chris, but you sure have influenced me to improve my 30s both in culture and in health. Thank you for all you do. Cheers!
Chris really doesnt like training 🤣🤣🤣 your face man, u are not in a forced labour camp
@ChrisAbroad @AbroadinJapan  What are your thoughts on this quote?  "If you know the way broadly you will see it in everything." Miyamoto Musashi
don't be fake their government...most of outsider love to lie. -:like orders nippon spot me have kind rude attitude... involve with chinese wicca and etc...they knew it, Japan so detail about this...so don't need to spy me ...cause they already did long years ago.
That was a awesome shot. I have been seeing clips of you in some paranormal video's.  I have always enjoyed your content. Keep on being awesome 👌 👏 👍
Chris Broad SUGOI!!!!!!!!
I asked what was your biggest regret about leaving the UK, to see the philosophy you have about the nature of choices and missed opportunities. Guess that was one of the ones you missed...
I did a question about filosophy and he didn't read it.
The absolute sass he threw Sharlas way
Keep up the training, you're looking better already! I hope the bike ride doesn't kick you too hard.
I always get a little exited when I see that a new Abroad in Japan video is up, always nice content Chris, good diversity and fun idés, have a good one mr. Broad. You have such a nice personality and here comes prace from a stranger, you have a good sence of humor and the videos are entertaining and there is such a nice feeling watching it, so calm and comforting, it that makes sens haha. Now I'm done, have a good one    Ps: ofc, always amazing production quolity
You should do a day in the life of Natsuki!
Actually the ban of foreign tourists will be lifted mid September but now it’s going to be easier for the US , Australian and I think the UK to get Visas because they emplimented the E visa policy which will make it easier
happy 10, ive been ysing you and others as a guide for how and what to expect. thank you chris
Chris showing us a beautiful picture of Sharla on her asking was truly priceless
Id love to see mroe sketches and mini movies from you chris!!!  youd make a good scrooge and a great villan lol
6:28  Is that Nyan?
Damn you had Nic training you. The man is made of muscle and good food. You are in good hands. Good luck losing weight. I am aspiring for it too. Hope to see you become one of my role models for this.
so happy to hear you are improving your health through fitness. Yay!!
Chris what do you think of popcorn? Idk about u but this popcorn is bussin
Is this an intermission episode for the journey across Japan Okinawa episodes?
Going to Japan seems like a huge trip, and I put it off for a long time, partly because I wanted to learn Japanese more before going, but I am really happy that I finally just did it. I ended up going early November in 2019, only a few months before covid became a thing.
Highly recommend Wheezy Waiter for behavior change tips. Plus he's funny!
Not me, gonna be there in 4 weeks, no chaperone, no tourism company. 😎
Is that Nicholas Pettas I see ? Aka Junk Food Japan ? Good to see you working together again. And even spotted a Sharla on that channel now. 🙂
We kinda deserve it tbh.
Abroad in A Christmas Carol starring Ironmouse as Scrooge
Been watching you for... I don't know how long, but you're one of the 2 or 3 channels that I've watched every video on. I love Abroad In Japan and all that it's shown. Can't wait to see what the future holds for you and the channel!
Rofl poor sharla 😂😂😂
So this is what you were editing on the bike dono stream 🤣
That Temple University photo looks professional dude.  I like the suit.
Super-lative lol
You inspired me Chris, I have lost almost 30 lbs this year! (About 13 KGs)!
Oh hell,  here I wanted to ask a broad ..
You want a philosophical question? You get a philosophical question.  Admittedly, I don't know much about Eastern philosophy, but when comparing it to Western Philosophy like Hobbes or Kant or Descartes, what are some areas where they overlap and in the areas where they run counter to each other what do you think are the merits that each perspective brings to the table?
I'd definitely watch it Chris
I've come over from the stream to help that click through rate. I got you king 🤴
I'm longing to see my relatives in Japan again, but not under all of the hassle of additional rules, procedures, and visas. Ugh.
You know what Chris, I really admire the effort and dedication you put into your work. Your cinematography is fantastic and something to be amazed by. Your Fukushima documentary is one of my favorite vids because of how well the visuals are paired with the commentary, and in some cases the imagery speaks for itself.
honestly your already looking thinner in the face, or you adjusted the camera. good luck man really, im sure you can get to the point where you arent feeling bad about your health
i don't get why japan still bans tourists,  even though they know that this measure did not prevent any coronavirus, and they still have hundred thousand locally transmitted coronavirus cases.
I miss going to the gym, did it for half a year a while ago, 3 times a week, noticed a TON of change Now I'm the heaviest ive ever been... schedule cant allow me good gym times  Congratz on the goals and the 10 years mate!
okay deal: they let us in, we drink the tax up to 10%
i submitted a question about the meaning of life but i guess you didnt get to it ;(   lol
Omg @sharmeleon your faaaaaace
Love the 80s workout montage! Also loved the video and your honest takes on Japanese culture. Congrats on the 10 years Chris!
Best quote from Chris ever, "Do it again in my mouth", lol. Congrats on ten years.
I would definitely watch a feature length Christmas Carol if you made it
It has been a struggle to visit my family in Japan. My father currently lives in Kyoto and will send me pictures of empty areas that used to be so full of both domestic and foreign tourists. It is absolutely eerie to see.
I’m down for a Christmas Carol Natsuki edition.  Chop chop cake man
Love the answer to the question about the algorithm, good on ya for your honesty 👍🏻👍🏻
Natsuki playing Scrooge would be dope
i've been in korea for 2 years now, lord knows a place that took covid very seriously and gave us all endless tests, quarantines, special 'foreigner' measures, etc, etc ... and japan's approach still mystifies me. it's an outlier now with china under the CCP, pursuing totally bizarre policies. i don't want to sound like a pandemic denialist or anything because i fully respect the rules here in korea (and wish we had more of them in the UK): but japan's policies make zero scientific sense. it's just bizarre. the fact they allow in tourists if you go through a travel agent and a guided tour says it all. are people who pay 2.5x the price for a guided tour made more immune from contagious disease or something? just pure silliness.
Glad you made a commitment to health, Chris! Good luck on your journey—I'm sure it will be an inspiration to many.
Your analysis on the Youtube thumbnails are spot on. I've only been watching videos due to interesting looking thumbnails.
Abroad in a Chrismas Carol. I love it.
Money > Politics if they don't want open then they can go broke.
Yes! Please do your version of the Christmas Carol :D
bugger off! Fine I'll go to the gym tonight
Get some Soke'.
5:27 ;) the sight for Chris' sore eyes?
I am begging you. Make the Abroad in Japan Christmas Carol. And make Dr. jelly one of the ghosts. It will become an annual tradition.
And I for one welcome our hot Musk-Broad offspring overlords
Japan's three phase plan for economic recovery hinges on young people.  Phase I: Drink more alcohol. Phase II: Drunken unprotected sex Phase III: Having more babies
Natsuki sound bite of Go F yourself is hilarious.🤣🤣🤣😂😂
The Abroad In Japan Christmas Carol - now with more big Dickens energy!
@sharmeleon Sharla is going to get you back for that one, for sure...
PLEASE make an abroad in a Christmas carol
Hey, 40 is not old.....*cough*
Watched some of the livestream with you and connor with the bike-ride. really inspiring. you will do the best that you can Chris. Happy 10yrs chris. you're an amazing person.
I love how your fitness trainer looks like Sylvester Stallone, it really sold the 80’s montage 😂
PLEASE give us that Christmas Carol, that sounds sooooo good
So in order for my comment to be in Chris vid i need to diss Chris, i see i see    Hey Chris you s*ck
Worst. Boyfriend. Ever. 😂
Thats what i want to see on the channel, chris with the guy of junk food japan going across japan discovering the numerous martial arts styles that must exist in the country.
What is the answer to life, the universe, and everything?
6:26 I would 😉
Maybe you can try streaming your workouts too.
Honestly as much as i wanted to visit japan over the years...it really faded away. And now, im not really phased of them isolating the country, it's whatever, besides im 30 now.
The ending bit of the training montage was awesome.
Japan must be a haven for terrible cooks since everyone is afraid to criticize their cooking.
Get fit with KETO (ffs). You will be surprised how much the body reacts during the first 3 weeks.... But it will require - no alcohol!
Chris finally made it to Junk Food Japan's gym
9:26 "yes please do it again in my mouth"
Man, I love vodka after work.
Abroad in a pan plz <3 you can get Champs Japanese kitchen to help you get into it :)
Try the Keto diet Chris. It works
Amazing! they say you should learn something everyday and i certainly did watching this video, Salted egg flavour crisps are a reality....i bet they taste like shit though.
abroad in Japan vs KSI.. lets make it happen :D
I want an Abroad in Japan Christmas Carol,  featuring Chris as Scrooge, Joey as Tiny Tim, and Ryotaro as the Ghost of Christmas Past, and Natuki as the Ghost of Christmas Present, and Connor as the Ghost of Christmas Future.
You don't need to worry about bears, sharla will maul you good enough
Ten painfull years 💔 😢.        Just kidding Chris youv kept me alive !!!      Literally
Do it! We need it! JAJ Christmas Carol
If tourist are Banned how did Toast and the crew get in ?
Fuck yeah, Chris getting that dumpy. That's what I like to see
I actually dont feel bad for them.  They bent over and said "yes sir give me another....while I lose my life savings and go out of buisiness".
Your reaction to that (really bizarre) hate mail was hilarious 😂 I'm glad you wade through that nonsense for our entertainment!
LOL  @ 7:35     That should be on a MERRY CHRISTMAS Card or Christmas desktop
When he said "ah yes, do it again, in my mouth", I really felt that.
Florida is almost all old people and they never shut down and they are thriving.     so.................?
Hold on Chris youre getting fit, you were doing some work on the punching bag. Apparently youre "gonna be able to take on anything next year." Maybe abroad in Japan for next years Creator Clash?
Please! A Christmas Carol!  Even if its 5 months late <3
Hey Nick, nice montage.
chris you really looked like you were having fun exercising
Why is the cup a wooden box
I've thrown away better food than this 😃  Wit is also a weapon.
12:44 its not the human eye that's drawn to that, its the AI in the algorythm being able to identify exaggerated facial expressions easier than subtle human expression. it promotes what it can categorize.
Drink more alcohol, how out of touch can japan's government be?
Congratulations on being on the platform for so long successfully!
Chris say what you may but the most essential part to your health is proper diet and rest then exercise. Plz don't eat fried stuff in the next challenge. If possible throughout the video. Wishing u all the best with this new journey.
It's the same here in China, brother. No one can really even come in. Most of us foreigners here haven't been home since pre-2020
Starting to appreciate how much effort is being put into the video making now more than ever. learnt a lot, thanks chris !
I do hope you reach your goal of becoming fit Chris! That 80's workout montage was really cool actually, and I can really see how hard you're working for this, good job and keep it up! :)
Happy anniversary, but THE ONE PIECE…THE ONE PIECE IS REAL!!!
What about a global tour?  You cant just do Japan forever right?  I would like that.   Come to the US and spend 10 years traveling and making videos.
Hey its that Junk Food Japan guy! Nice cameo there.
just downloaded duolingo to learn some japanese!
Oh my gosh yes please make your version of a Japanese a Christmas Carol yes please
Unbearable?.. how could even you bear your self to such low puns.. Ah grate it spreads also.
Can you actually post a video under 2 different titles?
Chris is a pretty man child
I like your thumbnails, it's funny to see your clickbait images
your next big goal should be something with shabuya kaho, a local to seemingly every store in japan
Absolutely do Christmas Carol!! Anything Christmas really.
Christmas Carol !!!!
The guided tour thing sounds a lot like a certain Korea we all know and "love".
i love this series♥️
I just got accepted at Temple and when people ask, I'm going to say its because Chris Broad taught there.
Honestly, having been among the throngs of gawping tourists in Kyoto and elsewhere in Japan, I don't blame the people there wanting to be free of us for just a while longer. Still, i'm keen to go back once they do open back up and I would hope that everyone who does go is mindful to be the type of visitor they'd be happy to have back.
Its literally an entire society of soulless robots.
chris don’t let the hate get to you, you’re looking sexier than ever my friend
How did you morph into Alan Davies @7:35?
As someone who grew up with a foot each in American and Japan culture, I get what he’s saying about Japanese TV and food vloggers, but also feel like he’s describing American morning television and food/travel vloggers.
Chris gonna do Youtube boxing next year. Called it.  And I can't fucking wait!
“Do it again In my mouth”-Chris 2022
I feel sure that I've seen a YouTube video about that abandoned school with the bears! Wasn't that you?
Great content, here's to another 10 years. These videos absolutely make me want to visit Japan, but absolutely not live there. 👍🙂❤️
If that bear is huge... You will never go to Alaska...
I always thought Chris Broad was reallllly cute and really a very chill friend to have if I had the pleasure of making friends with him, ever. Don't listen to the troll comments because you have so many people who love your content! And you definitely improved so much over the years. ALSO! Weight gain isn't so uncommon or bad, I've been gaining weight as I get older, your metabolism and lifestyle plays a big part in it as well. We just have to try our best as every body is different xP
A Christmas Carol in Japan  Yes yes yes yes yes please Yes yes yes 🎅🍥🍣
Chris channeling his Hotei it seems, similar body he has.
Abroad in Japan Christmas Carol please! PLEEEEAAAAASEEE!
The work out montage at the end was epic. Let’s go Chris!
I gave up on Japan, seems they just want to lose
Ohh, I see. The elders are following the "Tokugawa Jidai" when Japan secluded itself from the world...sorry old people, the world has changed :)
Lack of Tourism is bad for the economy and instead the government tells them to drink more booze?
4:10 definitely can see what inspired the Silent Hill 4 Water Prison design. Edit: Also glad to see you using the wooden saki cup you got like 2 years ago, it's a part of Abroad in Japan cannon now.
They say you don't have to be faster than the bear, you just have to be faster than Connor.
The entire situation only really reached my attention with the fact that NJPW and other wrestling companies in Japan couldn’t use foreign talent for a year and a half. It’s crazy that it’s gone on this long, but I understand it’s the government trying to keep people safe. The foreign wrestlers are back as of this summer at least.
Japan has no ability to think for itself.   ITs an autonomous society
I'm so glad Chris has decided to challenge himself this way, the boxing does make me wonder though, who would Chris face in a youtuber boxing match?
All Japanese cigarettes companies are also owned by japanese government. They really want more people to buy cigarettes too but since government can't promote that they went with alcohol 🤞
Christmas Carol with ya gang ??? A B S O L U T L Y !!!!!!!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤
9:27 AYOOO??????!!!!!
As a permanent resident of Japan the border control insanity really affected my mental health🥲 My mom is coming to visit and we had to make a visa for her so even for us residents it is not over 🙃🙃🙃
That uno reverse card to @Sharmeleon is uncalled for. Wahahaha
I miss Japan so much. I live a 3-hour ferry ride away from Fukuoka. It is really easy to get to, but I can't go because of the closed borders
Confirmed Chris fighting KSI
They’re a global virus hotspot at the moment. It’s ridiculous that they’re keeping foreigners out because the virus is already running absolutely rampant among locals. When it’s at that level a few people coming in with it will make no difference. They’re just shooting themselves in the foot being so restrictive for no reason.
Poor Sharla 🤣
Guess what vending machines ☺️
The world needs Christmas Carol the Abroad In Japan Edition!!!
Just remember, Chris. Weight loss is only about 10% from physical exercise. The only real way to lose weight is to eat healthy. i.e. No vegetable oils, no sugar, no breads. You don't have to do keto, but you should still be low carb, and carbs have to be processed by your liver. And while it is processing carbs, it can't metabolize fat. Meaning, you won't lose weight.  Also, please do not do heavily calorie cutting, that will only make it worse.
Japan went back to their "island complex" attitude (like Taiwan basically). They can get by staying close and they feel safer by staying closed from the outside world, to have control over the islands. Japan did it for hundreds of year, and the elders don't mind not having foreigners around. A more harmonious society with homogeneous populace... It will still take time unfortunately to open up completely.
I'm not gonna lie, I've always dreamed of visiting Japan, and ironically, only now am I making enough money to afford it. I'm 100% avoiding coming right now though because having some chaperone lead us around is honestly pretty deterring. It's an expensive ordeal, and my girlfriend and I want to be in control of our visit.
Chris i've never though about it before but, now that you mention abandoned buildings a colab with Sam and Colby might be an interesting video.
I want that “Oh No”sign on a tshirt!
Why not start a Patreon page and do your dream series there? Keep the clickbait titles and Shorts for YouTube, put all your artistic work somewhere that isn't geared towards click-through rates.
I wanna see Chris Broad on the next creator clash
Chris you should absolutely make the Christmas Carol flick with all the regulars, but you have to be Scrooge lol.
Kis's next opponent
Hahah🤣I love that final shot.  Ahem...sorry I'm sure whatever caused the need for ice hurt. Best of luck!
Congratulations on your 10 year anniversary! I love your channel!
Amateurs. You’ve been enjoying food lately? You have round-face.
One current exception to the no tourist rule is that if you have relatives in Japan your allowed to come here, If I remember right, hopefully I can introduce my daughter to my mother and grandparents.
13:40 Don’t think I’ve laughed that hard in awhile 😂 how could you torture a poor Monke that way? The Tungsten Rat would not approve.   …or would she?
Congrats on ten years Chris ! The blood,sweat and tears have been worth it. May fortune and happiness be in your life ! Cheers from Australia, mate ! 👍😎👍
Thanks for another great video! I cannot get enough!
I think in regards to the thumbnails, you're totally justified considering it's YT after all plus there's way worse out there.
Meanwhile, I look at my stomach that looks like Uluru.
9:26 "yes please do it again... in my mouth"   Chris? 🧐
So is Japan still going to be closed by like March or April because thats when me and my group of friends are going
Cdawg...
Well, Its good to see you making an effort to keep your self fit. However the Kim Jong-un hair cut really doesn't suit you.  Just  saying... Please keep up the good work in Japan. P.S. Never ever make fun of your girl friend if you want to keep her. She is really special.
something ive always wanted to do was get myself fit before i visit and potentially live in Japan. I want to be the best version of myself when i finally arrive. so hearing about you talk so seriously about health. and even seeing some proof is really nice to see. i hope we both can reach our goals. I believe you can Chris.
Hi Chris Congrats on 10 years on yt 🎉🥳,  Just a bit of a lil tip from a national level athlete, I strongly recommend martial arts for your fitness journey. It's 1 of the easiest to commit to forms of fitness (because it's fun), and at the same time it's challenging, and it even helps you get to know yourself.  All the best :)
I wouldn’t give a sh!t what people said about me or my videos.  They are just jealous that you are experiencing what they want to.
Chris, cliché as it may be, you really are quite inspiring in what you've been doing with the channel and for yourself. Also, YEEEEES Christmas Carol remake!! The Muppet version and Alistair Sim version are the best so far.
Please change the Journey Across Japan video titles to include series titles/episode numbers after the clickthrough rate is no longer vital. I hear Linus Tech Tips does the same.
YouTube video trends, and effectiveness of thumbnails, prove why Japanese TV is still full of react shows and over positivity.
I GIVE YOU AN EXCUSE TO DO IT CHRIS
Why would anyone build a school in the middle of bear territory?
This man's thighs really be looking like Mount Fuji
I'll watch all of them and help your algorithm
What!!???  Japan is banning tourism!!???
Lmao reasonably priced hitman 🤣🤣🤣
on guided tours: I think they're actually a lot more desirable than you might think, but the target audience isn't the West - a lot of Chinese and SEA tourists (especially older generation) like to go in large guided group tours
It's official, Chris Broad vs Trash Taste youtuber boxing coming next year
they should encourage foreigners to go to japan and drink with the locals :D
Need more fitness montages!! 💪 Keep up the good work Chris!
If you could have one wish come true to make the world a better place, what would you wish for?
10:50 Those were some of the most amazing camera shots I have seen. Really enjoyed the documentaries you've made.
I can answer it for you. the answer is .... 42.
More alcohol could also help the birth rate.
I like your honesty, Chris.
could you make a video about the spiritual / religious aspects in japan? what people in japan believe (spiritual or otherwise), what you think about it etc? you hear a lot online about temples, different gods / entities and similiar, but i never really found a good explaination of it all. it was always just "everyone thinks something different". it would be really cool if you could explain the spiritual aspects of japan more & how you think about this things.
Has been an Awesome run!👏🏽👏🏽💯
Japan should let Europe and UK tourists back in the country and the alcohol consumption  will getting better instantly 😉.
FM - You can't be that unfit if you're doing a 700km cycle around Hokkaido. Or...it's a really bad idea that will be the death of you. I s'pose you can cheat on Youtube & make it look like  you did it.  Also, what is a super-lative? 😆 Is that the best superla-tive?
Its often easier to get in/  stay in shape if you do so with your partner. That said, have you asked Sharla to exercise with you?
I’d love to see your take on a Christmas Carrol
Oh man Sharla…Chris did you dirty. I’m so sorry.
you're looking great Chris!! I can see the hard work is paying off! I'm a similar age to you and just started my fitness journey! Here's to health in our 30s! 🍻
You are the Ian Wright of Japan actually the dude from TLC channel before..  Your up front takes on things brings me back to your channel.  Your trainer looks like Sylvester Stallone 😂😂
They don't BAN tourists.  You can still visit Japan, however, it is with a tour guide/group.  You pay for a trip package and they take you to places they have prebooked and scheduled a head of time.  So no, you can't go by yourself and go wherever you want in the country, like shopping in shibuya, but you do get to still see Japan. The difference is you are with a tour guide and on a tour bus for the entire trip and are with other people from different countries. You all experience the same trip.
Way to go training for the ride! Glad you're getting healthy. Definitely inspiring me!
I KNOW we're speaking the same language, but I did a double take here 15:02 ; "Wait! Did he say that he's got a lot of Big Girls that he wants to do!??" But, he said "I'm not ready for that, because I don't think I'm disciplined enough for that now." Fair enough.
Really appreciate you voicing your distaste for the clickbait format. Always enjoy your sardonic style and all the perspective you provide!
i loved the idea of abroad in a pan xD maybe a second channel?
Yo Chris! Just wanted to say hi, still watching your videos, and say hi to Conor 😆.
Damn Chris, I appreciate the hell out of your personal standards for your channel. I love how honest you were about how you hate some of the choices you've needed to make regarding the titles and thumbnails, because it makes me feel like you really care about your craft, despite the sacrifices you need to make to have videos succeed. Please continue your journey here on YouTube. Please also try some of your binned ideas, and especially please make your take on A Christmas Carol. I feel like this is YOUtube, as corny as that seems, but I would hope that you continue on YouTube doing what YOU want. Congratulations on 10 years. Cheers to many more
PLEASE make a whole series about threatening the guys into accepting you as the fourth member of Trash Taste
On the topic of Kyoto and the overcrowding tourists, the idea that this is somehow the fault of all tourist is really dumb. Western tourists weren't the one descending on popular spots in Kyoto on convoy of buses. Those were organized by Japanese tour companies attracting mostly Chinese tourists and I'm pretty sure the tourist companies were also instrumental on shaping the recent policies on "opening" of Japan.  So this beg the question that if they don't like overcrowding, why push for the same guided tour where the Kyoto citizen were complaining about before? As luck would have it, western tourist didn't want those type of tour before COIVD and sure didn't bite on that trash now. Bigger joke on the tourist companies is that China is on an even harder lockdown than Japan so don't go filling up the tour bus with gas yet.
It’s interesting, being in Japan on a university exchange, outside of campus it is much more homogenous than normal. I wonder if there will be any lasting effects on public perception of foreigners after this two year ban.
I got cockblocked by this. I had already paid for being a semester in Japan and because Japans government sucks and classifies students as tourists
Poor Chris.  The negative comments are the best and worst part of YouTube.  I’m glad you take the comments humorously.  ❤️👍🏻
Yo who's that other guy? He's cute. You're cute too! Love your docs, can't wait for JAJ p.3!
This was surprisingly insightful and at times, vulnerable. I applaud you for opening up this way, even though you may not be rewarded for it. Best of luck with the things you do, and goals you want to accomplish.
I think the advice you gave about 'being a YouTuber' is spot on. Congratulations!
I like ya cut G
Most of the commenters are arrogant Americans. They should go to China or Korea. The foreign demand that tourism brings to Japan is only a few percent of the GDP. Logan Paul and his ilk who don't follow the rules should not go to Japan.
wowowow
First off, happy 10 year anniversary, Chris, keep it up as usual! I hope Japan really does open its borders up to individual non group tourists again very soon because this is going to give people a very special opportunity to experience such a very dichotomous culture  and also allow for some spontaneous exploration once again, which in turn will contribute to boosting the economy in a more sensible way.
Can't wait to see your Christmas Carol special!!!
Is this the video that delayed the biking across Hokaido for an hour? Legendary!
we really need the abroad in Japan Christmas carol
That ending montage looked like Chris was getting prepped for the next Creator Clash! Dunno who’d have the guts to step in the ring and take a swing at Mr. Affable, though…
Oh shit that school in hakkaido is where destination truth went (pretty sure anyway)
I’m so happy to see you starting your fitness journey! I look forward to the transformation (both mentally and physically).
Lolol I love how you trolled Sharla in the vid 😂
I didn't know you were an actor. Well...  I've taken the last image as a screenshot, and now I'm going to mess around a bit, then put it up as my wallpaper (whichever one is the background picture for my phone's desktop) under the title: This is What Trying Gets You     Don't Bother!
I hope your channel stays around long enough to explore the abandoned infrastructure of this generation just like you have with other locations from the past. I hold out hope that Japan will cling to its culture and recover from the hurdles ahead.
Stream of you guys cycling been super fun and enjoyable to watch. Keep up the awesome work!
Are you getting trained by Nicholas from Junk Food Japan?
MAN'S GONNA START YOUTUBE BOXING I HOPE
All my support to this boi, I love the ending! I'm one motivated by the improvement project that you are doing. Keep it up, chad!
I went to Tokyo in 2018 by myself for 2 weeks. I could not image not having that experience of just walking around the city, going where I want to and finding small amazing places and things that Japan has. I hope that they open the boarders soon cause I want everyone to experience Japan the way I did. There is nothing more magical.
I actually love when you go to abandoned places in japan. There's something so unique about abandoned places in general no matter which country but japans are something else entirely.
In regards to the last question, how do you handle deppression and anxiety?idk if you would but if you every want to chat just let me know. I've loved your videos and attitude/persona on the channel. Heck if it weren't for you I might not have found Connor and iron mouse or Joey, and I love those guys.
Chris Broad VS KSI?  Getting into the YouTube boxing I seeeee
Chris you've never looked fat at anytime in fact if you lost anymore weight your bones would show through your shirt
Hell yes… do it
lol you talk so down about yourself but you're really a fine looking dude. I get wanting to be more healthy though.
Abroad in Japan Christmas Carol 🎄 #Christmas
Still can't believe Chris's ad read was so good I though it was the answer for the QnA.
10years where did  the time go   beside the stomach. Lucky for you Chris you gets the privilege of doing another 10 years and tell them all where to stick the decorations on  Christmas 🎄 🤣🤣🤣👍.........   que 80's music 🤼‍♂️.
I find it poetic that junk food took your health and now Junk Food Japan is helping you get it back again.
You should really try kickboxing
What do you do if you just don't like the food ???
You're looking good and healthy, Chris. Good haircut as well.
Whoever said the mount fuji joke has not seen Chris's 2nd channel, calves in Japan. Especially the first episode... Cycling with Cdawgva.
I was not expecting that first shot of the workout montage. I spit water out onto my laptop becuase it made be laught so hard. XD   My laptop is ok by the way...
Dear Sir,   Exercise enhances cardiovascular well-being but exerts lesser effect on weight than dietary control.  Therefore please discard alcohol, soft drinks and processed meat (note: taking one step further, you can even substitute rice with cashew nuts/almonds/walnuts and eggs during dinner).  Water should be your main source of hydration, with the greens constituting a higher proportion of your daily meal.   As a reward for having more plant-based food than before, you can still savour the fried chicken from time to time (i.e. once or twice a week) to maintain the food variety.  Moderation and sustainability is the key to any form of dieting.  You can do it! 💯👍✌️  Best regards
Chris, why is your passport red? Did you not know that you are now entitled to a beautiful new BLOO passport?
The borders closed thing is so frustrating. Like, really... what are they thinking?  - Their population is declining at an alarming rate. - Kyoto is going bankrupt. - Tourism-based economy is in shambles. - The yen is low, thus encouraging even more tourists. - Foreigners are MORE likely to be vaccinated than Japanese people,. - Foreigners also have LOWER rates of COVID. - You can just mandate vaccines for travelers, it's so easy.
do the christmas carol it would be fun.
Maybe you can do a "christmas carol" but with diffrent challenges for each ghost
Am I imagining things or is Chris getting drunker as the video progresses? Haha
Coming out of the woodwork to say I discovered you about 2 years ago during Covid. I lived in Japan for about 4 years before coming back to the States to continue my career in video games some ago (about to release God of War Ragnarok, yay!). Your videos so beautifully encapsulate my love of Japan. They’re so well produced; I always look forward to your next video. Please keep up the amazing work! And yeah, Japan’s got to fully open up soon, because I NEED it!
Dude. I have been following your channel for years. Let these mother fuckers judge you. Fuck em.
I really thought my question would be answered since it was kind of deep and philosophical and it got a ❤ from Chris too, but oh well 😭😂 I always enjoy these types of videos so I hope there’s more to come!
Oishi Chris! Sugoi Chris! Gambare Chris!
When you do abroad in a pan, you must have Gordon Ramsay in them XD
"Oh my god its better than fucking the last supper" - Chris, 2022.
Honestly, I'd watch the Abroad in a Pan series.
Chris Broad vs Jake Paul finna be lit
I hope Sharla pre-approved that photo 😆
honestly... its maybe due to people being stupid and ignorant of other people's cutural rules like that one black dude who was being obnoxious with his music and... that incident with the suicide forest
Hey man, long time viewer here and love your stuff! I've been noticing you use a lot of comic sounds, which is fine in comedic videos, but the frequency is crazy and degrades the quality of your videos a bit in my eyes. Just food for thought!
watching a legit movie (even a short one) with abroad in japan people would be awesome
13:41 This is the best part in the video in my opinion
The fitness montages was like Rocky Balboa but in British edition   Maybe a fitting name: Shahlavi
Japan’s delusional ideas about keeping japan closed is the reason my father never got to meet my daughter before he died at the beginning of august.
I loved those shots of the abandoned city on the island. I enjoy them every time you use them so they're appreciated.
Congrats on ten years!!!
Regarding click bait titles, it’s the reason I’ve stopped looking forward to your videos. It’s also why I stop following channels. If it’s not good enough to stand without a click bait title then it wasn’t good enough to watch. Like shiny wrapping on American chocolate, doesn’t make it better than the low quality crap it is and I don’t have time or calorie allowance to wait and find out if it’s ok.
I gotta say, I loved those shots of the abandoned islands. Amazing stuff. Get better friends. :)
im just going to say your fitness coach didnt look like he was very fit,  do you think its a good idea to take advice from him?
"Do it again, in my mouth" - Chris Broad, 2022
I just can’t wait any longer
For a country that was considered to be "smart" and "advanced" They are doing pretty stupid things like wrecking their economy. Pretty disappointed in Japan and their governments. WHO and CDC should not be trusted especially with their blunder on handling COVID. They should reopen a long time ago.
Japan needs to start selling Strong Zero in the United States. How about a sexy series called Abroad in Japants…..
I am 100% on board with re-making A Christmas Carol, but only if Joey is cast as Dr. Jelly, the ghost of Christmas Future.
I LOVE them scenes/shots, Bring japan alive. Makes me want to go travel there.They own the best thing about watching breath taking <333
Back to back uploads. This is unbelievable
CHRIS, have you read Yukio Mishima? If so, what do you think of his philosophy? If not, perhaps he will help with motivation for getting in shape. I think you are friends with Felix, he is a big fan
How do you feel now that you and sharlemon are official
13:41 Poor Connor. They really should just let Chris in to their club.
I was suppose to go to Japan last year, and even join JET next year. With the way they are handling this whole situation makes me not want to go.
You are my fit-spiration now.  ^O^
YES PLEASE! ABROAD IN JAPAN CHRISTMAS CAROLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL I'm for it!
What’s the abandoned shipyard vid?
That's been one of my biggest fears for the past two years: that Japan is going to isolate itself again for 223 years - as seen before...
I'll totally watch the Christmas special!!! It's my favorite time of the year too!!
12:18 - Abroad in a trash can
Super lative!? Su per lah tive. Amazing work, excellent development of your channel and content over the years. Well done!
Sharla and Connor are just catching strays in this episode
That ad transition was smooth as butter.
No! no! dam it! I want to come to Japan and buy a piece of property like I wanted to do 2 years ago kyomachia hopefully in Kyoto hell maybe two I can visit 3 to 6 months a year now closer to 3 but as I get older closer to six. But I understand why they closed it up it’s there home so it’s there rules period.
MATE!   About the titles of the J.A.J. series... Can't they have "Journey across Japan" or an abbreviation to mark them as part of the series along with the catchy titles?   I realized in this clip that I have been missing out on Journey posts.... I have been actively waiting for them and.... avoiding these clicky titled videos at the same time. Awkward.   Anyways, good on ya for naming them what it takes to get the views. I will be catching up now. Love your stuff. Love japan even more tho ofc.
This is fine as the world is burning around me.  Sums up my dissertation
i always find it ironic and a bit weird to hire someone thats lets say a trainer for physical sports but it not in shape in anyway its just so bizarre like i look at that guy and think to myself your body is supposed to make me believe you know what  your talking about??
Looking forward to the health series. I want to get back in shape myself so some extra motivation is always welcome. Plus, my annual health check-up is coming up in a few weeks as well. Anyway, if you ever need an extra for one of your vids (located in Tokyo) I'm more than happy to volunteer. Cheers.
Kenbishi is my favorite it go’s down like water.😝😁
Do the Christmas Carol
An abroad in Japan Christmas Carol would be awesome! And a multiparty series on Netflix would be amazing!
chris should go thru his japanese haters and react to them in the over positive japanese way
If you`re into abandoned places, definitely visit Sado Island!
Cheers for ten years!
I would totally watch your Christmas movie.
Rapidly losing all respect for Japan the longer they keep "locked down". Let's be honest. This isn't about health safety it's about Japanese racism thinking that all foreigners are dirty and diseased. I hope Japan stays locked down for YEARS. Take a leaf out of China's book and forget about Japanese history. Foreigners won't need gun boat diplomacy to open up Japan in the future because Japan will be so poor. Then the foreigners can sweep in and buy out all the properties from the Japanese. Good job Japanese racists! You are speeding up the downfall of Japan and ushering in the Chinese era, your ancestors must be so proud.
I don't watch all of your videos honestly. Just don't have time or sometimes the topic is not interesting for me. I do though appreciate your sense of humour and watch Tokio creative, because it is obvious that you guys have fun there
What you eat is more important than exercise.
His sake cup is made of "hinaki" -- typical horrid Englishman, lording his superiority over the natives.
I am with you! Fitness next 4 months!
8:00 where as in Britain it's misery, Exaggeration and full of sexual remarks
That wasn’t a work out , that was you just getting punched in the face over and over 😂
Wooah 10 years! Also mediocre?! Bros got drone shots and Natsuki how more pro can it get???
just stop reading comments Chris! lol
I am happily cheering you on in your fitness quest!
Don't mind the haters. They're just jealous of your affability.
Excited to see you remake rocky
This bouta be the hypest training arc in anime ever
Abandoned buildings connect with the parts of us that feel abandoned.
Im surprised in your Montage that you didnt get that Girl to kick your ass at boxing :)
ダガことわる!!!!!
You know once everything settles down in Ukraine I can really recommend going to Chernobyl if one is interested in abandoned buildings. Great stuff there.
Notice how the character’s eyes in the “Lock the Toilet Sign” are suspiciously more rotund than almond in shape…as if leaving the toilet doors open would be something only foreigners will do. ….yeah well FOREIGNERS ARE NOT THE ONES SELLING USED SCHOOLGIRL PANTIES FROM VENDING MACHINES YOU TWISTED SICK FOOKS!!!
12:50 Unfortunately that seems to be the case nowadays, I personally avoid stuff like this like the plague, I make a point not to click on clickbaity videos, unless it's from a channel that I already know, and know that the content will be entertaining. I hate with a passion this trend towards clickbait and exaggerated reactions, but it seems that, unfortunately, I'm in the minority.
Know DSLR Guide? This is him now.
Eat two low carb meals a day, then no snacking !!!!    Hahaaaaaaaaaa...  Good Luck
Great piece of art. Appreciate it.
Chris, we love you and your content. Youre doing an amazing job with your health and we all believe in you!!!! also jus so you know, even with the click bait thumbnails, we really come back for you and the content you create for us. Heres to another era of Abroad in Japan!!!!
Ah well, at least I can say I got to visit once.  There are other places to see, of course, but I always had at least 2 more trips to Japan rattling around in my head.
An excuse to do it
I just got news that Japan is opneing sepetember 7th WITHOUT REQUIRMENTS  what are the chances we get this news the day this video comes out?!?! GET PACKING GUYS WE ALL GOING TO JAPAAAAN!!!!
Japan being isolationist? What an unexpected turn of events.
It's not the physical activity, it's the food we need to focus on. I spent the past 20 years overweight and finally decided to commit to weight watchers this year and lost 35 pounds. I needed a plan and support. Just sharing what worked for me in case it would interest you. Not that you have much to lose lol. Love your work. I've been a fan for years. Congratulations on 10 years! Much love from Canada. 🇨🇦❤️
Bruh. Finding my question in this video was actually pretty cool. 😂
If I don’t get a Abroad in Japan version of A Christmas Carol this year then my Christmas will be ruined.
So, please understand this is a question in ignorance, but you have mentioned that Japan suffers from both overpopulation in the cities and underpopulation in the country (pretty sure the latter word is wrong), but given the disparity of population density, wouldn't it make sense to offer incentives or benefits to evenly spread out said population densities?   It's just a thought that occurred to me. I could be looking at this completely the wrong way, hence why I'm asking
Give us Abroad in a Pan! At least one video
i hate for chris to get hate comments. He works so hard on his videos and it shows. He has an excellent eye for constructing videos and hes so well spoken!
I haven't watched the recent videos because I didn't know they were a journey across japan.
xmas carol lewts do it na
And just like that Chris never saw Sharla naked ever again
Calling it right now! CDAWGVA VS ABROAD IN JAPAN BOXING MATCH FOR CHARITY
Mate iv ordered a box of Sakee
Abroad in Japan presents 'A Christmas Carol' featuring Natsuki as Scrooge with his new catchphrase, Go Fuck yourself! You gotta do it!
Good Job Chris!
Our Bears are bigger lol
If they're worried about their saki companies, open up tourism. They won't go under then...
please do an abroad in japan christmas carol i wanna see natsuki in a santa outfit
I say all "holy" books are bullshit but I hope my being continues after my body dies, and I hope there is a library after death where we can learn about everything. I wanna read about alien philosophies and their music. I really wish that. :)
Yes
Chris, do you want to be loved a little by evryone or loved alot by a few? Be yourself and go back to your roots. I love you brotha
Chris, are you an actual nihilist, or are you just a fake nihilist on film?
When I took a Japanese class in undergrad, "omoshiroi" was a lifesaver for extending a conversation length if you didn't know what else to say or were trying to remember what a more intelligible sentence could be. Always amusing to see people take it to such an extreme level in Japanese TV, albeit for very different reasons 😂
Ooooh boy you're getting shiny the sake must be hitting!
Abroad in Japan has been around as long as I've had my cat. Nice. Lol
NGL, that montage looks good
I've been watching your stuff for most of the time you've been on youtube, and this really drives it home- I've spent a lot of time wasted on youtube videos.
A series where you just try new stuff and cross collab with sports YT'rs would be great
Chris could definitely be the director of cinematography in a production team if he was recognized by some studio or other.
Christmas Carole please!!! That would be sick!! Brother!!!!
This aged well. Japan is essentially open from the 7th. One company already offers a simple service where you submit your plans and they basically rubber stamp it.
And after that montage scene, I won't be surprised if Chris and Nicholas stuffed themselves with an ungodly amount of food for the Junk Food in Japan channel
Lmao the photo of Sharla made me cackle 😂
they just announced they let tourist in later this month doe?
One of my paranormal went there it is very haunted
Boxing? Good choice, hope you enjoy it.
saw the negative ones so i thought i would leave a positive comment. absolutely loving the videos, i really enjoy watching you and your friends trip in the last few videos, best videos i’ve seen on yt in a while
Classic Japan xenophobia and draconian laws. Japanese citizens can go anywhere but no one (alone) can go in.  Edit: Most companies are dying or getting bought out from Japan it's just pathetic.
NGL, the Mt. Fuji one had me dying laughing.
Hey Chris, keep at it. It seems that the weight loss is working out!!
Are you still a reasonably priced hitman?? Asking for a friend :/
Something I do think is worth mentioning about guided tours is why the Japanese government probably wants guided tours. Imagine just how much easier a guided tour would be to do contract tracing on...  That said, I have plans to go to Japan in March and I'm going to be good if I can't go because I'm certainly not going with the guided tour. Haha
"...in my mouth" lol
Keep up the good work we love you chris!!! And sharla too lol
Not gonna lie, would love to see an Abroad in Japan workout series :P trying to get myself back into shape so it's nice to know others are struggling too lol
I've never found that I need to consistant praise things in Japan, Ive always found Japanese people ask you to be critical about either a dish or drink or service because they was to improve what they're doing not because they expect you to perhaps it's a different thing in Tokyo
Embarrassing 🇯🇵
I don't even like Christmas but I'd watch a Abroad in Japan Christmas Story!
Really enjoying your cycle with Conner, and great to see you training with Nick. You’re crushing it with your health and fitness goals, nice work!
Japanese people were always allowed to leave and return with no issues. Yet foreigners can't do the same because we're "dirty". All while Japan is currently having the highest spike in the whole world. Oh the irony. I've had to cancel my trip to Japan 3 times already and I'm close to saying fuck it and never going back again. There's no other way to put it, it's xenophobic.
Drinking alcohol and the sexual crimes, fatal accidents, liver failures & social problems that come with it are great ways to stimulate Japanese security & medical service sectors, as well as welfare services & crematorium entrepreneurs
A Dr. KFC Christmas Carol, who would play the part of Dr. KFC?...😋
Oh is that Nick, from Junk Food Japan training you? Great job on working out and choosing it as your next big goal, Chris.   Take care on the cycle, try not to fall like Connor.
Whenever Natsuki's "Go fuck yourself" part comes on screen for the hatemail bits I understand it like "No one cares about your negativity."
Japan get rid of those restrictions and take my money!!!
I’ve wanted to go for years. Now it seems I never will. Too bad.  But that’s their choice.
Glad that you took on boxing for your weight-loss it will definitely destroy that mount fuji of a belly lol, you might also find it easier to box in a southpaw stance since you're left handed.
I felt your pain at the end bro. Great job. Keep it up. If you don't have your health you don't have anything. Be well ❤️
We're coming to Japan nov 2022
I really enjoy your videos. Keep it up.
Congrats on your decision to focus physical and mental health. Forget all the haters!  Abroad in Japan? More like a stud in Japan.
Happy 10 years, Chris! I've been a follower of your channel since 2019 I think. Watching your channel has been my inspiration for visiting Japan in 2020 but then the pandemic hit and I was forced to cancel my trip :( I'm really hoping I get to visit next spring!
I can't wait to see how much better you look after your next journey across Japan! The clips from Connor's stream look like you're having fun so far, ziplines aside.
Epic training montage at the end gotta respect the effort you are putting into changing your fitness and health
I really hope you're right about Japan opening up again. My visa expired in April and shot my chance of going back to visit friends to hell.
I keep forgetting tipsysake only ships in the US! You tricked me last time too Chris. Such a tease!
I hope that you actually focus on your diet this time chris wish you the best on your journey✌
i went there 5 years ago and i still havent gotten to go back 🥲
Good morning, Chris. Have a nice day.
Chris I think your looking great, we could both stand to lose weight but I think you are a dope youtuber and a great looking fellow. Good luck on more of your journeys
I'd watch Abroad in a Christmas Carole
I would absolutely love Abroad in Japan Christmas Carol!
Got my haircut for the first time in over a year only realised i got the chris cut lmao
Japan: no tourists  Everyone who wants to come to Japan: I smell bitch in here
I want you to know after watching your first how expensive is it to travel to japan video I actually went in 2018! Thank you so much for your wonderful videos Chris :).
You are awesome Chris! Have you thought about living for a week in a temple learning to be a monk?
Bri’ish people be like: yewchewb
I really hope you're able to achieve your goals for fitness and the workouts go well for you, Chris! You definitely motivate me to try, too, as I approach 30 in 4 months. :)
PLEASE give us the Abroad in Japan Christmas Charol! I love it to bits as well, especially the muppets version, so I would absolutely love to see that!
QA video where you mentioned how much you hate having to clickbait titles... with this title. 😂 Case in point, I guess.
Have you thought of having a website which links to your videos and organizes them as you'd prefer instead of having to bend to youtube's whims? Corridor crew has done a similar thing.
CHRIS PLEASE HEART MY COMMENT
Yen is not even CLOSE to being worthless you fool, people are buying up USD do to high interest rates so ALL currencies beside USD is at it's weakest in years if not decades. FOOL
Where did plants trees and animals come form? How did the big bang form life?
I'd love for you to do some Christmas stuff this November/December, and to also see how hard it is to obtain your precious fried chicken.
The fitness montage looked really cool. Also, Chris looked quite intimidating while boxing. Good luck with your fitness journey.
I don’t understand why you’re worried about bears after watching that boxing montage.
Yeah, I had been planning a trip to Japan with my family for over a year.  After jumping through a ton of hoops to discover that I had to be on a guided tour I decided we would just go somewhere else.  Family was really bummed but the carrot wasn't worth the stick.
Chris, for all that you say your best shot ever was the Connor with silly Batman voice, I'd watch an entire David Attenborough style series narrated/hosted by you with nice drone shots and solid minimalistic cinematography going through abandoned buildings and overgrown areas of Japan.
That 1980’s montage was EPIC. And damn Chris, i dont think I ever thought you were capable of working out so hard you would sweat that much. You really are taking your health seriously, I can tell. Good job mate. I’m happy for you.
Anyone thinking Chris Broad is not a filmmaker hasn't bothered to watch any of his documentaries. The one on Fukushima was not only an amazing piece of journalism, but also well edited. Anyone who has any familiarity with the indie scene knows how rare and valuable those components are!!    Don't get me wrong. I adore the more general travel topics. Chris is the snarkier British version of Rick Steve's Europe and I love it. However, the skill and care which goes into even his most "simplistic" videos is stunning. The quality of his productions are an excellent example of why people have turned from traditional programming to YouTube.
13:40 had me fucking dying. Haha
I love how Chris pronounces the word superlative as “Super-lay-tive”. Never heard that before. I’m used to “Super-laa- tive.
Am i trippinbg? That box aint a cup right??
If you genuinely want to make the Abroad in Japan Christmas Carol please do. I think it would be amazing.
Any complaints should be directed to Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.
素敵な動画をありがとう！I am Japanese born and raised in Japan and now based in Tokyo. After Covid started, I decided to share my life in Japan for those who like Japan.  I really hope Japan will open border for travelers asap ;( I really liked to communicate with ppl from all over the world…
I remember I made a comment on a past vid saying how I felt bad for Chris given how he was trying to be healthier but people were still making fat jokes. A bunch of comments got on my case saying I was taking it too seriously. It looks like some people weren’t taking it seriously enough.
It is called COVID, and eww why would you want to go to KoReA
13:39 i expected for connor to be wearing the exact same shirt. I'm surprised
How does anything (items, gadgets, cars, food, etc.) ever get any better without a bit of criticism?  or at least a not constant glowing praise?  To that end, thanks for all the totally mediocre content!  😂
Hell yeah bro keep at it and DO YOUR BEST DON'T GIVE UP. Keep up the hard work i know starting to work out sucks cause you want to see immediate results but you gotta keep pushing you will get there and it's not too late. It's good to take your healthier seriously your body will thank you for it.
Wow! Another cycle trip, good for you Chris!! You looked best during that series, slim and slick
You look younger.  Whatever you're doing is working, keep at it.
Please, the Abroad in Japan Christmas Carol is the movie we never knew we wanted to watch!!!! Sharla can play whoever Miss Piggy played in the Muppets version!!! Oh, and you get to be Gonzo (because we all know you are not a Kermit)... Joey is Kermit, Natsuke is "The Animal" and Connor is Fozzy Bear!!!
Chris will be in the next youtuber boxing match confirmed
Hi Chris, do you have any reputable tour agencies that I can book a trip to Japan?
Chris training for creator clash 2  Chris vs ?
Keep it up! You can doooo it!
Is that Nicholas Pettas from the YouTube channel "Junk Food Japan?!"  😏
Specifically waited till the end just for the montage
Japan has always been a isolationist type of country.. Its in the culture. So don't be surprised about this type of politics
Please make the Christmas Carol!!!
How on Earth did Chris get Sylvester Stallone to be his personal trainer? First Ken and now Sylvester? How does Chris manage these connections?
Dude, your 80’s montage made me think of a real life Little Mac from Nintendo’s Punch Out! Hah Keep up the good work man. Very inspiring.
Chris I'm in the same boat as you, 33 and used to live in a warmer climate but now I've been in northern Canada for 6 years working and fell into the worst shape of my life so now hitting the gym hard and trying to be as active as possible so I don't feel like my 30s passed me by and all I did was work and be outa shape.
Anyone have any suggestions for a Travel company to work with to visit Japan?
You should think about hiking a mountain with Quinlan (GoNorth Japan) for your fitness journey! That would be super cool!
You are awesome Chris, an inspiration to us all!
You should DEFINITELY spend all of November making Abroad In a Carol: Christmas in Japan.
I couldn't stop laughing.  Thanks for making my day with this awesome video
All the best for the 700k cycle Chris u got this ! 👊🏻 I also gotta do something cuz I’m going down a really shitty road😅and get out there and go Japan one day and adventure U have gave me motivation Chris but it’s always me stopping my self. Love from Blackpool mate 👍🏻
"Abroad in Japan-A Christmas Carol"- Please Make it so!!
I wanted to see how much of a big deal bear attacks in Hokkaido was and how many fatal attacks there were, turns out last year there were 9 confirmed fatalities and serious attacks(with suspected ones - whatever that means?!)  being the highest since 1962 when records began!, I always thought they weren't that large because all of the pictures I saw was of quite small, skinny not well fed specimens, but googles corrected me by showing there's plenty of chunksters lumbering about out there! :O
Lmao the photos. Also captured monke.
4:36 May people carry bear pepper spray legally? Stuff is better than magnum revolvers! Packin' bear spray gives you supreme confidence and no worries on hikes through bear country.
Congratulations!!!
Keep up the good work Chris! Both in making your videos and getting healthier! Also, don't forget to water Connor. He looked a little sad in your trunk.
why'd you decide to keep living in japan?
Does Chris have a collection of the ppl he knows looking like they just woke up? haha
My japanese friends didnt know we are not allowed to go yet, they didnt believe me when I told them the borders are still closed
It's like "hi, how are you". Nobody really wants to know how you are. Outside of "fine" nobody really cares.
I give this video many super-latives. At least four. Huzzah, I say!
Chris, I'm sorry mate but your haircut makes you look like an old man I hope it wasn't Natsuki's place
If Chris' Christmas Carol is sarcastic all the way, I want to see it.  Otherwise, forget it!
I understand why so many people are disappointed with the continued closure of Japan to tourists, but look at it this way: Almost every country that typically supplies tourists to Japan has much laxer COVID-19 restrictions than Japan does. Not only that, but a lot of countries have been experiencing another spike in cases. Not massive spikes, mind, but spikes nonetheless. Is Japan being overly cautious? I would say probably. Hell, the only way I can even travel to Japan right now is on military orders to visit my family stationed there.
Really like your honest take on japan
RIP Chris. I can't believe this is his last video. Or at least it will be after Sharla gets to him 💀
The editing on that ending montage was beautiful.
I was about halfway through planning a trip to Japan two years ago. Now I probably won’t go.
Sharla is the worst with clickbait titles and thumbnail photos. I don't know how many times I've seen her post sad-faced thumbnail photos with titles like "I've got something to tell you...." or other crap like that, and it's something normal like she took her cat to get his nails clipped and he didn't like it. Dislike being manipulated like that, tbh.
The why is simple, no politicians have the guts to take responsibility for anything. If cases spike after opening they will have to probably resign, as is the way in Japan. So dont expect any sudden changes.
I love it when Chris reads hate comments and see how he sarcastically reacts to them. It's never not funny. ROFL
I'll say it again- the blanket of niceness has been ripped away from the ruling aristocracy of Japan. The political powers at be are old and xenophobic, and this simply won't change. Look how far they're going- rather than just let people into their country (where covid is at an all-time high by the way), they're encouraging young people to get shitfaced. You know, the same young people they wanted to deter from visiting izakayas after 8PM during the pandemic. Make it make sense!
We NEED An Abroad Carol
Yolo
Ironically enough, @13:10 I didnt watch that video due to the click bait title. I'll give it a watch now.
With that fitness montage is Chris gonna join the next Creator Clash?
Finally, the court jesters can speak out… ‘so to speak’!
Japan's population is declining because people are realizing the Earth is dying, the world is horrible and they were being worked to death. Who wants kids in this time ?
I can personally promise to the Japanese government that if they let me in, I will drink my weight in Kirin Ichiban.
omg GREAT JOB ON THE FITNESS, CHRIS!! You're motivating me above and beyond to go back at it again as well! In fact, I think I'll just join you. And definitely will ask you a philosophical question for the next one, haha. How did you find your trainer by the way? As he's not Japanese but you're training in Japan (: At first, I was a bit stunned because he looked like an older version of you and I mean that in the most complementary way possible because if that's what is lying ahead for you.... Bless. Hahaha Can't wait to see more of the fitness adventure! The best of luck, mate! You can do it! And so can I! WOO!
Is drinking out of a wooden box a common thing over there?
Why are you drinking out of a plant pot? 😂
Beer is bad for your health. I stay away from that to avoid being like Misato from Evangelion. Ramune is what I would drink—maybe tea.
I wonder if their backwards logic is also hoping that if younger generations start drinking a lot more, they're more likely to socialise with the opposite sex, thus more likely to get into relationships and have children. That might sound totally nuts to some but really looking at what a lot of governments have already done in the past I'd say that doesn't even register on the Richter scale 😅
Well crap, I guess it's time to bring Commodore Perry back from the dead
Congratulations on 10 years. Ur fitness montage should have been Jane Fonda let's get physical mixed in or with eye of the tiger
damn Chris has massive calfs
Interestingly enough, I haven't watched the tropical villa video due to the "clickbaity" title, nor the yacht video before that for the same reason. If the titles had been along the line of  "JAJ escape to paradise ep. 2", I would have probably already watched them. I have nothing against what you're doing Chris and I understand why you use these titles and thumbnails as most people will be more likely to click on the video, but for me they're a bit offputting makes me less interested in watching video. Just wanted to share my thoughts on the matter.
Japan should have tried enforcing the laws and cultures onto the tourists if Japan is worried about mass immigration so much.
Hey! We never lost our thousand years of independent cultural identity just seventy to eighty years ago at the hands of the biggest savages on earth and only just entering a deeper stage of national trauma that usually follows widespread denial! Nope! Everything is fine! There's 100 different kinds of Kit-Kat and you can get one off a vending machine at the top of Mt. Fuji! Suck it and move along, gaijin! Nothing to see here!  Their own government has to encourage the young to go outside and get more drunk and stupid, FFS!!!  They're either going to crash or crash badly... probably soon.  Edit: big props on the urban infrastructure, though
does anyone know what video is being referred to at 9:48? i kinda wanna watch the whole thing.
If we don’t get the AIJ Xmas Carroll now I’m legit going to be so sad.
Keep up the good work man. You're doing Great!
Pls do your version of A Christmas Carol, with all the weird you can add. <3
🌞
Glad you're getting trained by a pro.. His YT channel is pretty good, too. (Fast Food Japan, I think?).
... because they can.
Because of you
I've seen a lot of comments on recent Japan related videos saying they have trips booked for November to Japan. I sure hope it opens up!
Ill be going there soon, what should I look to buy while the yen is down low?
do it again in my mouth very sus Chris lol
Have you ever considered ejaculating in Hokaido somewhere inconspicuous and then revisiting the same spot a year or two later to inspect how your seed evolved in your absence? Maybe it grew moss? Or maybe it grew sentience and launched WW3? Let us know in the comments.
"oh my god, it's better than, fucking, the last supper, it's the best thing I've ever had, times ten, squared, yes please, do it again, in my mouth."  So this is now something Chris has said in his life
Not going to lie, you’re pretty fit compared to some people I know. Don’t let other people look down on you.
If you hate your thumbnails. Go to nebula.
I hope you don't ever stop making videos - it truly is your calling. Your style never gets old and I just love all the comedy you share 🥂
Last time they "banned" tourists it lasted for 2 centuries.
So Japanese presenters are all just Jimmy Fallon.
YES MAKE A CHRISTMAS CAROL!!!!!!!!
9:26
Chris, I really hope you see this.  As an endomorph, having a body type that makes it very hard to lose weight, I found intermittent fasting the best and most effective way to lose + maintain my weight.   I'm 37 and in the best shape of my life since my teenage years and have maintained this for the last 5 years.  'IF' has been the biggest game changer for my health.   I pray you find this comment in this sea of comments.
The part about Japanese sugoi versus British criticism, lol; I never watch Gordon because his show is just bullshit British negativity. And I watch Japanese bullshit positivity shows because I want that as much as people want Gordon's negativity.
Hearing about Japan's strict policy toward foreign tourists really depressed me. I really hope that they change their policy by the end of this year. Here's hoping.
Chris, if you ever have kids you will be in PEAK dad joke mode all the time. I say this as a dad, you can easily reach the top echelons of dad joke fame.
today on UFC Chris "MT FUJI" Broad vs Connor "Irondawg" Colquhoun , should be a great fight!
Abroad in Japan Christmas Album PLS!
I appreciate you putting most of the impacts in the training montage in time to the music
At this point if the Japanese government put out a PSA titled " How to be a High Functioning Alcoholic"  I am going to be 0% surprised.
That sucks bro. Cause I would love Journey Across Japan ep.2. That would be the sh*t in my opinion. The Journey Across Japan series is honestly the 1ST thing I binged and lived on YouTube.
Excellent work so far Chris! I look forward to seeing what creativity comes from you in the future!
Your videos are always so inspirational and it's great to hear you're making aims to put yourself first. I would love to continue to watch your journey of self care and Japan! You got this!
What they going to do about Pokémon world championships 2023 in Yokohama Japan..? Many people are the world will come there..or at least those who can afford it .or win trip money..from playing and winning big events..
“Why tourist are banned?” Cause of americans and white people
I find the tourist restrictions quite silly now. The vax have helped and the variants aren't as dangerous. COVID is not going away and will be with us for a while
I can’t believe Japan would rather promote alcoholism among their own citizens than allow foreign travelers…  Oh wait, yes I can!
Are u going box someone?
Really appreciate how frank you are with your thoughts in this one especially 😄. Just want to say your videos are among the most satisfying on Youtube for me - you should see the grin on my face when you upload. Netflix soon, surely! Here's to another 10 (😁).
Noooo it breaks my heart :( I want to do a trip to Japan when I graduate;—; hope when 2023 hits Japan let’s foreigners in.
Please make a Christmas Carol where Connor is the ghost of Christmas Present
abroad in a christmas carol sounds wonderful
that fitness guy used to be on nhk right, he is like a mma guy i think
I've sent through all my pre-booked hotels to a travel agent as though it's my itinerary hopefully that counts and I'm at the Sapporo beer fest this month. Doing my bit drinking copious amounts of alcohols.
I'm seeing a lot of boxing..... Chris for creator clash?
Love you
I have been watching your videos since the beginning and love the transitions of your videos into the awesome content that you have now! Keep being awesome!
We're certainty appreciate new lens on your camera that makes you look thinner and healthier, Chris!
That 80's montage was awesome!!!! The sound effects matching the music soooo good
13:28 Oh my god, the birth of Killer Chris! The Dark Timeline is real!
A great way to celebrate is to lose some kilos. If not youre going to regret it in 20 years. Ill even help if you want.
I think they need to stay closed till this is all over I mean all travel should be stopped
Fuck the cinematography and editing.  What is this, school?  Lets get that Christmas Carol Special started.  You've got at least 2 months.
personaly. i love your chanale ... but i hate a lot your your thumbnails and titels ... i never wanned to say this ... BUT hearing you also dont like them. make's me happy and feel a bit more confturebull to say this. (what i persoanaly hate the most. is seeing an amount of monney in a title or thumbnail). i mainly start watching when i realise it come's from your chanale. i hope i did not offend you whit this comment
I would legit watch Abroad in a Pan
Did you know that Gigguk used to work for the BBC?
that outro!
I just recently had a interview for a job in Japan and I got really excited thinking this was my chance to go back to Japan to discover last week that they decided to hire locally and crushed all my dreams.
Chris, you've actually already been looking a lot fitter in your most recent videos! Keep going! I'm currently going through a bit of a quarter life crisis myself, and I'm dealing with some similar things: especially with discipline and weight loss. I feel like I'm constantly maintaining my weight no matter how hard I try, but it's definitely inspiring to see you making improvements as I know it's something you've struggled with too, so thank you!
Fitness Montage: Is that a photo of Connor on the wall?
Thanks so much for the last 10 years Chris, countless hours of entertainment giving a view of a country I'm in love with but haven't been able to visit for myself, THANKS SO MUCH!!!!!
Is this foreshadowing that Chris is going to be getting in the celebrity boxing ring?!
Glad to see you go on your own fitness journey!
Me: "Hmm he is looking good recently, im please for him. Maybe I should try this working out malarkey, too." Also me: Actively shoving a pitta smeared in about half a jar of peanut butter in my God damn mouth so fast I'm surprised I haven't choked to death yet.
I have family members living in Japan and they're happy to see fewer foreign visitors in their cities. Far less crowded obviously😂
hey chris i doubt you'll see this but i also want to get fit, how do you find the motivation to do it? I'm in a slump atm.
I’d like to see an Abroad In Japan Christmas Carol. 🎄
Chris is going to be the next Rocky Balboa
Christmas Carol yes please.
I would totally watch A Broad In A Pan
The only way to open Japan borders, is to US Navy forcing them!
Honestly I've seen many Asian families doing guided tours to countries I happen to visit so I know they have their appeal, but as someone who enjoys a relaxed vacation and freedom that ain't it for me
You already look less puffy now. Well done and keep up the fabulous work!
Congratulations on your 10 years
Foreigners cannot cross the Japanese borders due to phrases such as ''this is a pen'' which will inevitably cause the armageddon and destroy the planet.
How does one be a Japanese critic? Surely there must be SOMEONE in the society whose job it is to compare things and rank some lower or higher than others.
congrats on 10 years of Abroad in Japan \ 😄/ and yes, Abroad in Japan's Christmas Carol would rawk! 🎅🤶🧑‍🎄🦌🦌🦌🦌🦌🦌🦌🦌🦌as far as overused phrases, I vote for non-Japanese chefs saying "umami". really. I think if Japanese people would have predicted how often used that word would be, they might have thought twice about floating that balloon 🎈🥢I suppose it could have been worse, like if Nukesaku's "fukuro-no shiwa nobashi!" caught on (gawd forbid) 🤪and "what is a soapland"...where they make soap rofl 🤣best of luck to you all on your next 10 years, and gambatte kudasai! 😁👍
I would love to go explore abandoned buildings in the dark with Chris. I will hold the camera and the light :) I used to do abandoned building explorations all the time about 15 years ago.  More recently, just before covid I got into doing weekly solo hikes deep into the woods at night in Colorado. Night hikes I would call them...much more terrifying!!!!! But after the first few times it became one of the most relaxing and enjoyable experiences I have ever had. I really wanted to see something. Paranormal, alien....bigfoot. Never saw anything unusual in my adventures. Craziest thing I saw was a snake on the trail one night. I took a close up picture of him and kept on cruising. When I got back to my truck I looked at the picture and it was a rattle snake! Haha, just chillin on the path enjoying the moonlight.  I always brought a gun just in case of a bear encounter....never saw one at night, but I am sure they saw me. Since Japan has outlawed guns I would definitely bring a samurai sword.  Usually bears are more afraid of you and will stay far away. They are not a major concern unless they smell food on you. Ghosts, bears, chupacabra...no, the most terrifying monster you are going to encounter on this Earth is your fellow man.
Holy shit, Abroad in Japan Christmas Carol with Natsuki as Scrooge. I need this.
oh my gosh please make a playlist of all the music you use cuz i cant get enough!
man f++k those mean comments, you've done more than does guys could do in a lifetime. keep up the good work.
I think Japan not opening goes beyond politics, I think it's a predictable cultural problem, particularly since the Japanese aren't very vulnerable to covid since almost all of them lack a gene that makes it worse.    I think the reason Japan wont open is a combination of; group identity over individuality; fear of the new/risk aversion; and fear of being seen as wrong. Those huge parts of Japanese culture as far as I have seen. Add them all together and it makes sense to have a large part of the population that doesn't like to be seen as being part of a group that is in the wrong, or has people in it that are in the wrong, and don't want to be blamed for a (relatively) "new scary thing" like covid. So when "scary new thing" acts up they try to blame some other group or, just flat out try to deny any problem with their own group. So, no more foreigners because they want to stop covid spreading, but also want to blame foreigners for spreading covid, and don't want to accept that one, covid is something that can be lived with because its still "new" and therefor scary, and two, most spread is going to be down to the majority, the Japanese themselves.  Other examples where I think this cultural problem shows are; the ridiculous police conviction rate, because its culturally unacceptable for the police to be seen as wrong; the societies refusal to take sexual assault seriously because "we Japanese men can't be that bad, it can't be that serious! *buries head in sand*"; timidness in classrooms where kids, older kids in particular, are afraid to speak up, and any that do and give a wrong answer tend to be cruelly mocked and bullied by the rest of the class; the tendency for communities to investigate foreigners for wrong doing before they investigate Japanese, even when a Japanese person is in the wrong, or even consistently in the wrong; the extreme reaction following WW2 when Japan was absolutely, undeniably in the wrong, following which they went so contrite as to go pacifist (which is only now barely wearing off), and then also tried to forget about the shameful parts and blank out much of it.
why you got to be so mean to our lovely Connor 🤣🤣
5:25 aaaaaaaaand Chris is now either single, or dead...  T'was fun while it lasted!  Thanks for 10 years of great content.
Excellent Q/A. Informative and entertaining! Thanks
13:39 LMAO
Good Luck with your road to becoming a swole  jock gigachad Chris. Love your sarcastic tone contrasting with your geniuine love of japan its really refreshing
Sharla makin luv face. ill pass. 🙂
That un"bear"able dad joke proves that Connor is pregnant and Mr. Affable is the farther 😶
Oh I know this one, I believe the answer is Xenophobia! (I could be wrong)
We need to hire the actor Matthew Perry, outfit him as a 19th century general, and send him out there with our demands. That's how we get Japan to open.
Abord in a pan would watch
"Super Latives."  How could you Chris. 😂
Your scenic shots have always been one of my favourite parts of your videos.  They set the tone well, they make beautiful backgrounds, and it really gives a sense of scale or an alternate perspective.  Keep up the good work.
drink more so you will have kids!!!
Chris you should totally tell your Boxing Coach that you're a southpaw.  He's got you fighting orthodox!
Well, it is said that cycling and sexual activity are the two quickest ways to loose weight and get into shape - I hope you and Connor have a very successful cycling tour together...
I can only hope younger folks start getting more politically active in Japan to combat the horrible working conditions, stop nomikais, and just make the country more open overall, socially. Probably not gonna happen any time soon, but eventually there will be a tipping point.
Is that a "Cup Of Soup" humidifier? lol
Clearly Chris is training for Creator Clash against Connor.
BIG YES To producing A Christmas Carole! Please team up with Trash Taste, all of your friends and make it happen!
Your persona is such a vibe! Love it!
Please do Abroad in a Christmas Carol.  Chris as Scrooge Natsuki as Bob Cratchet Ryotaro as The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come (so we don't have to hear him speak.) ((im joking ryotaro is lovely))
They don’t want you, so why do you want to visit. Even the Japanese I know don’t want to go back.
YouTube boxing event in the future? The training montage and “physical challenges” seem like some obvious hints
Given that God is infinite, and that the universe is also infinite...  would you like a toasted teacake?"
Journey across Japan with Ken 2023?
Love the guy at the start judging you for being a "youtuber" and his name is literally "Johnny Smokes" and has a DMT profile picture... send help to try hard Joe Rogan.
Chris and Ryan Reynolds are the only 2 I could watch doing ads all day
Abroad in Japan: A Christmas Carol?! Hell Yes!
Do it! Make your version of A Christmas Carol! I will make my whole D&D group sit and watch it with hot buttered rum!
Oh no that first picture of Sharla 😂😂😂😂 I'm curious as to what was going on when that was taken 🤣
"Do it again, in my mouth" talking about food made me laugh hard.
I've been watching through Doctor Who, and it strikes me that the Brits ALL seem to really really REALLY love Christmas. More than Americans do certainly. And as a Jewish American, I feel weird with really enthusiastic Christmas celebration because in the US that tends to come with a heavy dose of Christianity. I remember when My dad watched Harry Potter for the first time he was offended by the fact that the whole Hogwarts castle celebrated the birth of the baby Jesus. He reasoned that the witches and wizards should have HATED all of Christianity for all the persecutions and burnings of witches and claims that their magic was from being in league with the devil; that Hogwarts celebrating Christmas would be like Jews celebrating the birth of Hitler.   But the more I engage with British media, the more I realize it's that Christmas to the British is like... not Christian at all.  It seems to be an AGGRESSIVELY secular holiday. Like, the average secular Brit doesn't treat it as any more religious than Americans do with Halloween. essentially  But it also makes sense because Christmas is actually just secular saturnalia re-claimed by the Church. I do sort of wish that we could all stop calling it Christmas and start calling it Saturnalia because Jesus was born in the summer and Christmas is tacitly NOT a Christian holiday, so why is "Christ" in it?
What is your fundamental assumption about the universe?
Damn the hokido brown bear is so damn small the bears here are doubel the size
Oh lord! I hope Sharla was okay with you posting that photo lol. Congrats on 10 years. I can't remember when I first subbed, but it's been a while!
damn chris be fighting in the next creator clash
Is my question in there?🤩  Answer: crushing no😞
A Broadmas Carol please!
My question would be how do you drink out of a square wooden mug? That looks very uncomfortable
Nicholas Pettas in the HOUSE! @JunkFoodJapan
Chris Broad Vs KSI 👀👀
32 I’m gonna be 47 in November
Boy do I love bureaucracy! 🤦
Because of your expertise in video making on YouTube I think the Christmas Carol idea would he bloody brilliant especially being a fellow brit and a big fan of Michael Caine  personally I think you should go for it Chris but also include Joey natsuke ryotoro as a few muppets 🤣🤣🤣
Dr. Jelly drama series when?
*Googles "Soapland"*   Ooooooh... 😯
Can you give us and example on how your thumbnails would look if you wouldn't have to make them with clickbait in mind?
PLEASE make an Abroad Christmas Carol! 🙏😆 If it’s anything like my favorite Christmas movie “Scrooged” (with Bill Murray) it will be amazing. Cast your friends and it’s sure to be gold. ✨ Also nice job on getting fit. I’ve been following the cycle streams and I’m super inspired to get fit myself. 🙌
👍 (I've decided to not be one of those people who wastes time leaving stupid comments. This is the last.)
I think the drink more is to help the population as people tend to have sex when they drink.
when is the connor x chris boxing battle?
A Christmas special would be amazing, would love to see a wholesome holiday special with a Chris Broad flare!
We want to go back to Japan so bad. I think that it’s not fair that Japanese people can go anywhere and everywhere but not take in visitors from other countries (especially within G7 countries). If these restrictions go on for another six months, G7 countries should reciprocate and enforce the same restrictions on Japanese tourists. Fair is fair.
You got my upvote at unbearable😄 Great delivery
Happy anniversary Chris, much love from the UK, I’ve always admired your shots in your documentary style videos they are really on par with and better than those I would see on Netflix, you have honestly been the biggest insight into Japanese Culture I have see, Great work overall hope to see you continue to succeed
Abroad in a Pan: a cooking show where your friends show you how to cook healthy recipes in their kitchens! 😂 that’s a banger right there!
Over/under on how long before "yes please do it again, in my mouth" ends up in a Cdawg video?
NO WAY!!! I was literally searching this channel for a video I haven't seen and boom! so lucky Yeah....time sucks...but you have every day from now on and we all believe in you and can't wait to see your body transform. love you
Hi Chris. Are you forgetting how to pronounce English now?  "Superlative"?
Japan: our economy is going to shit.  Also Japan: fuck you we will fuck our own economy on our own
Seriously though, yes, Abroad In Japan Christmas Carol would be fantastic.
Depending on how covid pans out this year and we don't get some monkeypox COVID hybrid strain that will implode your buttocks I'm assuming that Japan will also open fully next year. Their covid numbers are also exploding right now, so it's gonna be interesting to see how it all plays out.
04:43 my beloved trumpet🎺🎺😍😭
The Japanese are racist small-minded people who cannot adapt to a changing world.
You should have put the 12:45 face in the thumbnail
Nicolas Pettas for your personal trainer!?, that's awesome!, Keep it up Chris!
YouTube is absolutely the secondary. I have been making videos since 13 and would consider myself a film maker to some extent, but in the end of it all I continue to upload to this day because I love it so much!  Keep inspiring people like myself chris! Much appreciate!
I am56 and really appreciate your health quest... I am going to take advantage of your quest!  I'm with you Chris! I have had a bit of depression and nihilistic thought... Seeing you torture Connor with the bungee  and seeing him and you appreciating his success... MAKES ME happy!
That was great.  Especially enjoyed the bit at the end with you getting punched.  Good work.
13:18 I'm ngl, I didn't know that was even a Journey Across Japan video and I was still waiting for the next series to come out. I get the clickbait-y thing and tbh I don't like it either. I don't usually click on a lot of your videos because of that but the least you could do is add the series name to the title
Fitness,  it's the British rocky, blocky
I'd be depressed about any video with a racist like Connor too.
I so BADLY wanna see your Christmas carol Chris
At this point this weird back and forth made me lose all interest in visiting again, they can do whatever they want, I'm not going anymore. There's many other beautiful places that deserve a spotlight.
Mr Affable Vs KSI
If your going to make a Christmas Carol take October too and make it extra special, I can wait and so can everyone that loves the channel
14:00 Hahahaha, my god! That had me laughing so much! I know what a Soapland is, so this was hilarious, almost like a parent answering their kid's question of "What is sex?" or similar :P Wonder how Chris will evolve after the Training Montage he's going through, will he be like Anime Characters and get extra powerful? :D
Just started watching the vid but I just wanna say: Sharp haircut, my man.
Actually, the thumbnails of your videos are the main reason lately for me to think twice before clicking on them.  I've been a fan of your videos for about 2 years now and the clickbate-y style of the thumbnails gives them a bit of a cheap, and boring feeling. Like, ah, another one of the many... Why should I even watch this? No hard feelings though. Overcoming the initial feelings, I am always happy to have clicked and watched your videos. Getting the dose of British sarcasm on various topics is always refreshing 😄
Is this the video that made you late to the stream the other day?
Your titles arent even clickbait, what are people on about?
Female Chris? 7.5/10 to be honest.
Great video Chris! Happy 10 year anniversary🥳
Chris, you need to begin storing food as there are growing global food shortages happening now. Use the spare space in the studio to store rice and noodles if you plan on staying there. Farmers can't afford fertilizer due to the fuel cost to make fertilizer- this means lower yields everywhere.
I imagine that the Japanese government is secretly trying to stop another Jake/Logan Paul incident and this is the perfect cover for it.
Stellar Q&A! Hadn't lol'ed that hard all week.  Fingers crossed for Japan reopening to tourists in an arguably normal capacity. Funny thing, I never thought of the political angle for the continued isolationist policy. It makes sense yes, yet I can't help but think that it's a horrible idea in the long run. I would believe that for a nation facing such a difficult challenge in sustaining a basically immortal population while having some of the lowest birthrates of any first world country would cautiously welcome foreign tourist spending would be a good thing, but I'm just an outsider, so what would I know, right?  In any case, hopefully traveling to Japan gets relaxed enough for me to finally go and follow my legs to wherever they may take me, though considering I'm a huge weeb I'll likely spend most of my time in the metropolitan area, but still, chaperoned international trips suck.  Cheers and here's to another 10 years!
25:33 The punches were suprisingly in rhythm with the background music.  Watching the montage, it's no wonder that he has such glorious calves at the cyclathon.
Whoa, ive just witnessed a new side to Chris in his exercise montage. Can we see you in a Youtube boxing undercard?? Big respect chief keep it up!
Does't matter if Chris has a belly. He's pulled a fit blond bird, because he's a top bloke.
You could start a only fans account and call it A Porn in Japan 😅😂
This was awesome, Chris! I'm really enjoying the cycle live stream, good luck with the fitness journey and the Hokkaido one as well. The 80's fitness montage is the example of magical editing.
I've followed you for almost 10 years now and I always look forward to your new videos still. Keep up the amazing work and happy anniversary!!
Maybe a good "bear savaging" would do you some good.  When is Pride Week in Japan?
The "Let's drink" think actually got some backlash because it was the National Tax Agency that was at the root of the initiative, more because of the loss in tax than for the altruistic goal of avoiding breweries' economic downturn.
DO THE CHRISTMAS CAROL
Looks like Nicholas is just beating you fit. That's the way to do it!
ニコラスペタス！
Tippsy! I used these guys along with some sake podcasts to up my sake game over the past 2 years. Now that I am one month into a trip around Japan that has included stops in Hokkaido, Nagano and Toyama I can say with confidence there is so much amazing sake in Japan. Better yet, it is easy to pick up a high quality 720ml bottle for under $15 which is something that will never be possible in the US or through Tippsy. Anyway, Tippsy gets my thumbs up. Good company, good products and information to help choosing and learning about sake easy.
Absolutely YES to Abroad's A Christmas Carol!
I been doing a favor for Japan then. I been going to Hiro and drinking every weekend. 😂
15:30......I feel personally attacked lol......but yeah I need to get off my ass and do shit too. Good luck! 👍
Been planning a trip to Japan with the boys for Q2 next year and just bought our flights two weeks ago without knowing this.... Yikes
Taiwan too. I'm really getting tired of waiting..but they have other things to worry about.
while it does make me sad, it does also confirms my suspicions of most Japanese people hating on foreigners and them being quite Racist towards other Asians. and no I'm not Korean or Chinese. you probably wont be able to guess it anyways lol
Chris abroad does powerlifting!!
Lol Japan literally wants to just sink into the ocean at this point. People refusing to make children, banning one of their highest sources of income (tourism), the worst living wages in the world in a high tier society and advocating the youth to become alcoholics. What an idiotic government
Truly affable, what a guy
You should start a secret japanese language channel, don't promote it at all, just drop a video here and there and see what happens.
That montage was beautiful
13:36 Killer Chris, back at it again!
God I love the Fukushima documentary! SUGOI!!!!
Recently started watching and can't stop binging everything!! Congrats on 10 years, and good luck for whatever the future brings!!^^
Chris's content is next level... But a custom Christmas Carol featuring all the regulars would be incredible. I support your dreams!!! 🙏🙏🙏
Next time Nic should throw some kicks like it's 2001 😂
Payback is a bitch and I’m sure Sharla is working on a pic to load soon.
Do all British people pronounce it like superLAYtives? Because Americans pronounce it like suPERluhtives
I'm supposed to go an exchange trip to Japan next year in December, here's hoping things are open by then
C h r i s t m a s   C a r o l
Just do what you want to do...Take a shot and  We all Love your work and Art!!!
9:25
NGL. The Chris x Elon girl is kinda cute. 10/10 would get rejected again.
How does it feel to be recently single now that you've shown us that picture of Sharla?
CANT WAIT TO SEE ABROADINJAPAN VS KSI BOXING EVENT.
I love thicc boys tho!! 😅😅
I love to vist japan  but i will wait until i dont have to book a guided tour.
6:57 Uh, yeah. If you needed a person from the internet to give the go ahead, then yeah. I hope Natsuki helps with the soundtrack
I would help fund an abroad in Japan Christmas carol in a heart beat
Su-per-la-tive.
Why are your arms so stiff when you jump rope? Flick it around with your wrists, or get a heavier jump rope.
Despite aging population, Japan has one of the healthiest populations. High life expectancy and low obesity rate contributed to widespread healthy diet, healthcare, and walkability. The elderly have a higher chance of survival.  Another excuse there aren't many hospital beds reserved for COVID patients even when Japan has the highest hospital beds per capita. Most hospitals are private and aren't forced to open up the beds and the lack of ICU resources.
I just arrived in Japan yesterday on a student visa. It was weird with the flight being 50% empty. My family was gonna visit me but they had to cancel their plans and it really sucks.
9:27 that’s what she said
quick, find some fried chicken before Chris becomes buff
"Yes please!  Do it again!  In my mouth!"  I don't know where to go from here Chris!  😂
Any country that treats you like a walking biohazard is not worth visiting. If Japan wants to destroy their economy over a mild flu, then that's their choice.
What a good twist, junk food japan putting Chris Broad to burn some calories.
Yes do A Christmas Carol!.
Because they're xenophobic as fuck.
You did Sharla dirty LOL
Erm Terry Miles  literally visiting Japan  lol
I've been waiting for japan to open their borders for the last year and a half....I'm out here trying to spend 10s of thousands dollars in one of the most enchanting countries in the world. I was there for 3 months before covid; now I'm waiting to get back. PLEASE OPEN YOUR BORDERS TO FREE TOURISM, JAPAN!!!
I could not imaged having to say things I don't mean when it comes to food. I am plain and simple, I tell what I feel. I may be kinder to go out of my way to say, this sadly doesn't suit me
Because we lack discipline and respect.
9:27-9:28 ayo what? 🧐
That clip of Connor in the church will NEVER get old. We know it's a favorite of yours Chris!!
Chris should start BJJ, will change your life!
Hip flexors
Sharla looks likes she’s asking Chris if he wants to see a dead body down by the rail road tracks.
IMO, if some ultranationalist Japanese had their way, they would like to kick out all foreigners in Japan. Chris, don't mind the fat comments, it is great that you are more comfortable with your body and willing to go shirtless after all these years.
Didn’t Japan just allow tourists to enter with non escorted tours yesterday? It will start on 7 September if I’m not wrong
I’m visiting Japan in a little over two weeks, traveling from the US.
You can actually tell in Chris' face he's been training
And that´s the way the cookie crumbles... keep using that, I think it´s cool (I know where you got it from)
yeah do the christmas carol thing. i'm lookin forward to it, so now theres extra guilt if you dont do it
You know, props to you on deciding to work on yourself after your health test results. It would have been easy to join the "fat acceptance" movement and blame it all on the system instead of looking internally.
Copying Joey's idea I see
Ud become "malled in japan" if u went to that school
If A Christmas carol in Japan isn't made, we riot! 😂
Thanks, For This Informative Video.
Yaaaaas King! More of theeeeeesssseeee!
Ryotaro is gonna have a hard time taking out Chris with what is shown in the montage
I thought i lost my coin box and here is Chris drinking sake from it...
YES! id love AOB a chritmas charol
Since you say Japanese TV is bland because they are so positive on them. Have you ever thought about inviting Gordon Ramsey to do a Kitchen Nightmares show in a Japanese restaurant?
Having Nick as a personal trainer has to be such a huge boost keep it up Chris!
CONGRATULATIONS CHRIS!!! Been watching a lot of your content recently ever since I discovered you through your boyfriend Connor. I can see you put tons of effort in every single video you've produced! My favourite series in your channel so far is Journey Across Japan: The Never Ending Cycle of Despair. Hopefully you will continue to provide us such astounding content until you feel like you need to take a massive break. Cheers on 10 years! Btw, any youtubers you planning of fighting? I can see you've got potential there hehe
How appropriate that your fitness trainer is "Junk Food Japan"
No way I was going to suggest linking up with Nick for your fitness! I visited his Crossfit Gym in Tokyo a good while back (How else could he do @junkfoodjapan without dying.... Plus with his martial arts back round...you can legitimately threaten the TT boys.
your girl is going to murder your face because of that picture
Absolutely Abroad in Japan’s A Christmas Carol. Never knew I wanted that video, but I think it would be absolutely amazing.  One of the Christmas classics and has plenty of ways to adapt it- Blackadder’s A Christmas Carrol is my absolute favorite
“Yes please do it again, in my mouth” -Chris Broad, 2022
Petition for Chris to start abroad in a pan despite the YouTube algorithm
i really want to say something mean to you, so i can be feature in those bad comment >_< but i dont know how....
I realize now how perfect you and Connor are working together. Chris Abroad the filmmaker and Connor Dawg the voice actor! Also Sharla is going to obliterate you lol.
I have family in Japan (or rather my wife does) so I was able to get a visa and I've noticed that it was okay but lots of odd locks and little kids covering their (maskless) mouths near us.  So yeah - but would so head there again.
I can see it now. ABROAD IN A PAN: where ever episode is Chris attempting to cook an omelette and every episode ends with the fire dept putting out an out of control grease fire
11:50 I appreciate them Chris. For whatever that's worth lol.
I vote for Abroad in a Christmas Carol!  Personally, im not a fan of the big number thumbnail videos. After seeing a few, ive just stopped watching them. If i wanted a house tour I'd just watch the shitty reality TV version with famous people.
What I want to know is why you keep showing up on my Facebook news feed advertising some university!!? 🤔😜
🤣 Yeah Chrisu such a damn weeb with your extensive anime knowledge and crazy style you look just like the kind of person who aspires to live in Japan 😂 people talk some absolute bollox! I've been subscribed since the first video, badly edited with terrible resolution and it's been inspiring seeing you become who you are now! Well fuckin' done mate!
Well done Chris. All the best! 👍
Literally spit my drink out when Chris reverse UNO card Sharla's question
Chris is feeling that Sake! Love you man, do you!
You have to be Ebenezer, and please, please make joey be tiny Tim 🤣
Connor kinda jumpscare
This is old Japanese isolationism rearing it’s ugly head. They keep announcing it and having to walk it back.
I get an impression that businesses and the politicians/banks want tourism to reopen, but for some reason the voting population of regular Japanese people does not want tourists back...COVID or no COVID.  The politicians just don't want to lose by taking an unpopular position.  Which is a shame, because I'm hearing Kyoto's economy in particular is really hurting due to the missing tourism, and reopening the country would really help them.
It's interesting seeing how people have started changing how the feel about Japan over the past few years after seeing how they treat foreigners in general. Like, I feel like I'm starting to hear more people describe Japan as "Great place to visit, terrible place to live".
Unsurprising. Japan has never been a free nation. Totalitarian Neo Feudalism, sums it up. But I guess that is how they want to be. Theu must like Karoshi and having the highest suicide rate in the world.
Eagerly awaiting Sharla's comment...
Training with Nicholas Pettas, are we? :D Must be an interesting experience! I'm looking forward to future content!
Aww. Poor Sharla, lol. Savage Chris, so savage.
I need more of fitness montages maybe it´ll inspire me to get fit too. :D
“Do it again, in my mouth” that could win out of context comment of the year 😂
Abso-fucking-lutely make an Abroad in Japan Christmas Carol "movie." I would actually pay money to watch that.
IS your trainer Nick from Junk food japan? That's so cool !
Nothing to do with Japan being weird or anything. 🤣
I hope the words ‘Yes please. Do it again in my mouth’ won’t come to haunt you Chris
They do it because it is funny to them:
Because commies gonna commie
Yes! Yes! A Christmas Carol video. PLEASE!
Bear today, gone tomorrow
I’m leaving for Japan in 17 days to study Japanese for 6 months. Tbh I don’t know how it is going to go with all this no tourists stuff haha. But let’s see how I can make the best of it :p.
What's the contact info for Chris the reasonably priced hitman?
News flash. TOURIST ban is lifting in Sept but even before that many have been admitted.  So as a click bait title this has failed miserably. I loved all your videos.. But this one? No thanks.  JTB started spamming offers since earlier last month.
Your health, both mental and physical is not only an investment, its a journey that's yours alone. By that I mean you do what's best for you and avoid comparing yourself to anyone else (because it isn't fair nor healthy). At the end of the day, all that matters is that you've started a new chapter at a pace you are comfortable with! Can't wait to hear updates!   Happy 10 years Chris - here's to many more *cheers*!
Abroad Xmas Carol idea:   each time Scrooge ignores the beggars , we hear Natsuki's **GO F*CK YOURSELF** soundbyte + explosion CGI
I already follow your channel for a long time and your videos lately kinda boring, just like another mediocre youtuber. I like this one video which I got some informative thing from it, not just watching you show off you stay here or there
And he gives the kid 3000 yen to go get KFC?
Sharla, noooo!!! 😂
Congrats on 10 years! Look forward to your upcoming fitness challenges. I’ve been cycling along on my indoor bike + enjoying the sights!
#feedconnertothebears
Chris did video ? but his cycling with Conor ... NANIIII ??? just kidding 🤣is so nice whenever you realease some video i know it is something interesting or at least funny most of the time both ...
Chris is the most affable criminal I've ever seen. Taking hit man jobs and kidnapping his podcast co-stars. Makes you think twice about what it takes to become a successful youtuber.
The praise thing, chuckled when you mention you have to say that food is delicious. People complain at me when I say "it's ok" or "it's alright" when eating something. Get told constantly that they can't tell if I liked the food or not 🥴
Good luck with the health goals! I am a couple weeks off 31 and my mind has been in a similar place. Power to you!
I love Japan and did study abroad in 2018. However, Japan's government needs to find a balance between lives and livelihoods.
You should do the Christmas carol thingy!!!
I honestly would have clicked on the more "boring" title for the video. I'm getting real tired of all of the over exaggerated YouTube titles
Bear mace is a thing. Just saying.
i fucking hate christmas, but i would watch the shit out of your take on a christmas carol
Happy b day to the channel
22,153th
Oh great, you're one of those "ugh my girlfriend is so ugly" jokers. 🙄   Literally never funny, even if she laughs along with. Quit while you're ahead. It's juvenile and gross.
I like the part with the 80's montage music.💪(Name of the song or track?) found it called  Master of the Hurricane.
Did he edit this while riding on a bike? Isn't he on the third day of cycling right now?
Finally. A box I can behind.
I'd definitely watch an abroad in Japan Christmas carol
Yes I would like to see Abroad in Japan Christmas Carol please🙏
It's not your fault you're british and your body type is fat by default.
hello this is the comment that you're looking for as an excuse or signal to produce abroad in japan christmas carlos
fitness montage or teaser for upcoming boxing match
So which face are you more sick of seeing, that Temple University photo or the "12 Things Not to do in Japan" thumbnail?
It becomes more and more clear to me although a holiday in Japan would be incredible, I just wouldn't be able to live there. I couldn't deal with nothing being genuine, it all seems a bit surface level and there's a lot of fake-ness.
The only perk non-Japanese people can get from the weak yen ... Is that every japanese hobby stuff (Gunpla, figures, nendoroids, etc.) Is cheaper now. Which is noice...
That Connor being tied up in a van caught me off guard lol
Abroad in Japan Christmas Carol starring Nasky as Scrooge would watch 1000%
Honesty, I would watch the hell out of Abroad in Japan Christmas Carol. You’d do it so funny!
Just finished the video. Please go to the round school at least briefly. It looks so cool! Be safe though
I never thought the Government was so thick as SH!TTTTTTTTTT   why TF would you close the country! it is dumb AF!!!!!
Have You😎
Wait, a compliment about Conner, Chris, are you being held hostage? 😂
Still looking forward to my Japan trip. 2032 can not come any sooner!
You should feel lucky I even clicked on that dogshit thumbnail
yaaa it's Connor. If i ever get to japan i want to go out on one date with him. to Relly get to know him.
Oh nooo Sharla!! Hahaha I hope you pre-approved the use of this photo
"fuck off, we're full"
I'm glad people asked about the cinematography because I've always been blow away by your shots! It's also cool to see you be more active, Im always so inspired when people try and improve on themselves. I wish you the best of luck and can't wait to see what you do in the future chris! Edit: the workout montage was awesome 🙌
I also like to get wrecked and sort library cards.
This is quite impressive how Chris still uploading even though he’s on the cyclathon now with Connor. Truly Mr. Affable
I'm still very much waiting for aboard in a pan Chris!
To the first comment in this vid, please don't go to japan, at least not with that icon ew.
British bloke here, nearly 10 years Japan permanent resident, software engineer: for context on opinions.   The lack of opening up the country is just pandering to latent racism in the country. The underlying feeling is, foreigners will bring in Covid, despite the fact that Japanese nationals have been very effective at doing that themselves.   With yesterdays announcement, that you can come into Japan without a guided tour package, but it still has to be a “package” is just a government bailout to JTB, that keeps them ticking over whilst not unleashing the tourist masses on a public not wanting to see it.   Am I grumpy about it. Yep. Should I make use of the last chance to see Kyoto whilst it’s quieter, yep! 🤣
Super-late-ive..?  Su-pearl-ative, darl!
On fitness: I started really focusing on my health and fitness starting in my early 30s. I'm 39 now, and in this best shape of my life. I think the best advice is to remain consistent and to set attainable goals that allow you to maintain that consistency. Cycling across Japan/Hokkaido is awesome and makes for good content, but I don't think those kinds of large activities need to be the whole focus. Just doing any kind of exercise for 30 minutes a day will allow anyone to work toward better health.
forced to be polite...is basic skill? ^_~🩳
An Abroad in Japan version of A Christmas Carol? Shut up and take my money you old Scrooge!
Akidearest & Chris pretty much said the same about Japan being closed.  Japan's economy is in trouble though so they need to do something. Can't drink it all away. Covid is already on Japan so no real excuse there.
I'll be spending most of December alone this year in Gunma prefecture. Considering A Christmas Carol is one of my all time favorite stories, I would be INCREDIBLY happy if you made your own version this year.
Open the border Kishida ya bloody drongo!
Yes give us A Christmas Carol in Japan. Risottoro as Xmas past and Natsuki as Xmas  Present would fit the bill. Trash Taste bois as the Hecatae of Xmas future.
I will move to Japan
Happy 10 years Chris! And thanks for a broad in japan
The photo of lock the door,why is there a woman going in a men's bathroom and walking in a stall 🤔😄
"Do it again, in my mouth!" 🤣 your videos are great!
Xenophobia. It's always Xenophobia.
Omg Sharla’s photo took me out!! Was not expecting that!! 🤣🤣💀
If I were to apply in the JET program right now, am I still able to enter Japan?
Sharla is going to sick Tuna on you for that photo lmao
Cos gaijin Baka
Yes,  Muppet Christmas Carol!
PLEASE MAKE THE CHRISTMAS VIDEO!!!!
Hell yes, Abroad in Japan: A Christmas Carol would be amazing.  Natsuki as Scrooge?  SIGN ME UP
" Dot it again, in my mouth " 🤣
you look like every japan that moves to white guy   no diggity no doubt imma hit dat
日本は感情論ばかりで、ウイルスがここまで弱毒化していることは数字を見れば明らかなのに自粛を続ける。 政府も役人も責任を取りたくないから取り敢えずそのままにして変えようとしない。
I’m finally coming to Japan in October via a student visa and all I can say the entire process is as bureaucratic as it gets. It still hasn’t even ended yet and I don’t expect it to until I actually touch down in the country.  I’ve kept the mindset that I appreciate how difficult it is to get into the country (outside of tourism) as to me it helps maintain its safety but not opening fully back up for tourism at the expense of Japan’s economy certainly seems to be taking things too far. The lively hoods of many in the country are at stake after all, especially the tourism industry.
I've been waiting for so long. We all know you have insane diplomatic powers so Chris please do something
We do appreciate the cinematography, keep doing your best Chris-san. This type of storytelling and filmmaking differentiates you from the mediocre YouTubers with GoPros.
Considering the tribulations attested to on your current cycling trip, this seems rather fortuitous timing for the video title.
Happy anniversary again!!!
Lol call that a big bear.....jeez not even the size of a North America black bear.....Polar bears......now that thing is huge
I absolutely beg you do an abroad in Japan Christmas carol 🙏🏼 the best Christmas present to the world
bren playing prrdona 4 have you?😉
Bladerunner in the background?
👏👏👏👏👏
A workout with Nicholas Pettas! Nice!
I hope you are not editing these after cycling with Connor dawg VA Like you did for 1st journey across Japan.
I love your videos and im not sure why
Do the Christmas Carol!!😁
FWIW, I don't mind the clickbait thumbnails, only because I know there will be serious content behind them.  And keep doing those drone shots, or whatever makes your vision come to pass: you're absolutely right about them, they are amazing and will stand the test of time.
Congratulations on your 10th anniversary.
Ayyyyeeee happy 10th anniversary to you and your channel reaching 10th years of success.
You actually made me want to go cycling again man…  btw really funny clip you made with connor there in the van 🤣
Ow you're already insult your girl, huh now i believe that you're Englishman, mate
In the clip of you swinging the ropes in your workout. Who is the random dude in the photo on the wall 😂
14:10 Like a king said a few years back..."Soapland is a place where you catch Chlamydia"
I wish Japan introduced a retirement visa or long term visa. I would retire to Japan tomorrow if they did.
At this rate I won't be able to visit Japan til I'm at least 30
Abroad in Japan’s “Christmas Carol” must happen!
Not buying shit from Japan until I can visit. Open up or go broke from lack of Tourism money.
The reason we don't ask you the meaning of life, universe and everything is because we already know the answer is 42.
Dude. You are the best. I'm about to kick some jerk butt if these trolls don't stop disrespecting you. BTW, still trying to catch up on the podcast. I'm mid 2020 and super excited to see what is up. Anyway, on to my question... I know you don't really care for anime but would you do me a HUGE favor and watch Shokugeki no Soma and review it? It's a bit fan-service-ish but I love it and want to hear what you think of the dishes as someone who has enjoyed a lot of food from that area. And the story if you can manage to finish it. Lol Pete too if he is willing. Please and thank you!
Disappointed trumpet @ 4:42 God I missed that 😅
Congratulations on ten years! I'm glad that you're celebrating by taking care of yourself, mentally and physically.
We've been planning a trip since 2020 and have been waiting almost two years. Hopefully we all get the chance to visit again soon!
lmao bro you wrong for that sharla pic
yes pls on the christmas carole!
whaaaaaat, was planning to go to japan next may D: (amazing videos <3 )
I’m a bear and please please feed Connor to me
PLEASE. make a christmas special, drunk santa natsuki will be legendary
When will we get the first episode of taken for garnted?
Hmmm... Abroad in Japan. a Christmas Carol. I believe this is a necessity good man!
They ban tourists but let a Cdawg in? To live? Come on Japan
Sharla asks, Sharla gets....oh lord xD
liking the new haircut chris
I know Chris touched upon packaged tours but, I've heard that Japan is letting tourists (with no guided tours) enter starting early September?? Is that true or is that just a weird rumor that's been around?
please do the CHRISmas carol video!!!!
I was so lucky to visit in 2019. Dream vacation. I hope I can make some plans soon to come back!
Broad by name broad by (physical) nature.
Great intro! Natsuki in Santa's suit
wouldnt stomach like mt fuji be a compliment since for the longest time chris could never get a good photo of it
Nothing says “better the country” than “become an alcoholic”
Japan’s stuck in a discount late Edo period I see
Love the content, keep it up 💚  Also, please please do “A Christmas Carol”.
chris being annoyed abt having to always be positive is very fitting considering how sardonic brits famously are
5:30 Chris will sleep in another room full month after his cycling trip 😁
Omg when he put up that unfortunate photo of Sharla 😂 Chris is such a little shit and I love it
Abroad in Japan Christmas Carol is what 2022 has been missing! I hope you can make it happen 😊
i really hope japan opens up its borders in the coming years, ive wanted to go for so long and its super upsetting to see the country blocking foreigners from coming in, even if they have their reasons
Get back to cycling!!!
Ive been watching for 2 years n love da content
Meanwhile, I am in Taiwan when I originally planned on studying in Japan along with many other students, adding money to the local economy and coming home with a positive image of the country. Japan is shooting itself in the foot
That Sharla question/request really backfired on her 🤣
Superlative... prounounced Soup-pearl-at-iv 😉
Keep Calm and Eat Your Salmon 👑
I can tell Sharla is plotting your demise from that photo
09:26 😏
This is a certified affable Ask Abroad episode 👌🥶👌🥶👌🥶👌🥶
Hell Yeah
Nice, comfortable enough to joke with Sharla.  xD I literally cracked up since that is exactly the same relationship my wife and I share with each other.  Hope you two stay well ^_^
I love that Sharla was the one who asked for photos.
We need a Journey across Japan Christmas addition especially with another dr jelly in it lol
Chris, update us how Sharla enjoys that picture of her you show. I will enjoy future episodes just knowing you live thru the experience.
My wife and I are devastated.  We thought we would get to do a big, once in a lifetime trip by 2021 at the latest before possibly having children and changing our lifestyle.  I have the money and the time, but I'm just not allowed in.
YES!!! ABROAD IN JAPAN CHRISTMAS CARRROOOOLLLL!!!!!!
If he doesn’t drag IronConnor to that abandoned school ………..
When you have seen a Grizzly Bear within 5 feet those Brown Bears look like Dogs
Get Connor Eaten
Obviously, filthy foreigner language spreads covid more readily.
The tourism thing is so deflating. The nonsense that you are required to have A GUIDED TOUR or schedule through a travel agency who plans out all your shit is so prohibitive to me as I do not like structure of that kind and being dragged around by some stranger or forced to stick to a schedule is not relaxing, especially since the people involved would be those that I just met. It is not ideal for someone who lives relatively spontaneously. It's like the Japanese government has no idea what "tourism" actually is in this day and age.  In short: fuck guided tours and travel agencies.
9:53 I used to watch Japanese tv and YouTube when I was small, and the editing is spot on lol
I've been trying to go to Japan for a long trip for about 2 years now but after the latest changes I decided enough was enough, and changed my flight to Korea. Good grief Charlie Brown
You SHOULD do Christmas carol I would sent money just for that :D srsly :)
Hi
A Japanese style Christmas Carol could be interesting... the ghost of Christmas past has to be colonel sanders though, and if he's not ill be very upset.
Yes! Someone else who loves the Muppets Christmas Carol!🥰
imagine thinking you are entitled to visit or live in japan. the west is dead.
10 years! Well Done Mr Broad.. may you be presenting for another ten years... or for at least as long as you wish to!
Tokugawa Ieyasu poking his head out of his tomb: "Did somebody say...ISOLATIONISM!?"
I’m supposed to attend my best friend’s wedding in December. Looks like I may be attending virtually.
Good video man!
Japan scared of tourists coz they don’t want more ppl like Chris abroad! 🙄😂😉🐶
5:25 hahahahahaahhaa
Oh so I just got to the photo of sharla… she is single again now, right? 🤣
They'd make so much if they let tourist in
What is the feeling in Japan about what the 7th September easing of travel restrictions will be?
Happy 10 years! Thank you so much for all your hard work! Your videos make me want to visit Japan so much!
Look Chris... you didnt have to do Sharla like that... Anyway Happy 10 years my dude!
Deja vu I have been in this place before.
The thought of Chris producing and acting in his own version of A Christmas Carol is absolutely brilliant.
It's ok Chris, I laughed at the bear joke
Japan made you much more rotund!!
Japanese gov is showing how subservient they can be to the World Economic Forum. Abe paid his life because he wouldn't kowtow.
he was drunk filming this
Well sharla's comment didn't most certainly backfire lol
The most abandoned building anime short I loved to watch was a segment in the Animatrix collection. Heyyyyy... be nice to you girlfriend. Great job working out. Ur inspiring cause I don't do working out.
netflix? in 2022? yeesh...
I blame Logan Paul
Congrats on ten years Chris!
My question is at the end of a hard day does your Mrs get to Motorboat you?.
the video says out 4 min ago but people leave comments about the video that’s 25 mins long what am i missing 🤯
At least your honest about Japan unlike some other “influencers” I know who overhype countries.
I'm coming back to Japan if it kills me, whether the Japanese government likes it or not. I banked all of my higher education on this dream and I won't have xenophobic old bastards ruin it all when 90% of the country is generally and genuinely not that same mindset at all.
Congratulations on 10 years, you're the man
As a white American who’s never been to Japan. I feel I can, with 100% confidence, say to the government of Japan- THE YOUNG PEOPLE DON’T WANT TO BE DRUNKS. I mean, the numbers back me up here. 🤣
Hey Mr Affable, what made you change your mind on sponsor ships? Best of luck on the biking thats commencing in 4 minutes
Please go to the abandoned school and feed Connor to the bears!
Was this the video Chris was in the car for an hour to upload?
Really leaning into that neo-Liberal persona, eh? Using that first curated question as a lead in to your sponsor? Shameless, Chris.
'Now in 2020...' have we time travelled?
I'll tell you why they still haven't opened. It's because they're big meanies :( They just announced they're taking another step towards reopening and they even mentioned wanting to align with other g7 nations in terms of their border restrictions so hopefully this is a good sign that we might get to enter before the end of the year.
Calves of a god
I thought u said you wouldn't do sponsor ships on this channe;l?
sharla's pic lmao
I don't know how they can keep it up for this much longer. Not only are foreigners kept out, but people are still wearing masks regularly. I simply can't comprehend people putting up with this forever
Hi Chris!
Awesome job chris
Edit, really first.
I wanna move to Japan so bad since im doing freelance 3d animation, but getting a visa is almost impossible for freelancers D:
You bloody average white man 😂
They're scared of the English, giving them all the ick!
Nice fade Chris 👌 suits you
Babe wake up! Chris Broad posted!!
I will be there end of this year. Ten years! Good job
Literally everyone: Just open up the country and get that tourism money  Japan: How about NO
Love the Q and A's, thanks Chris! And yes make the Christmas Carol happen. 👍

I do miss the Ask Abroad videos. They were fun to watch since we were all people stuck inside going insane watching a person stuck inside who was also going insane
Good morning squad :D it´s half past 2am here :D
keep up the bangers bro
My dad lived in Japan for more than 30 years and I also grew up there as a kid. My whole family really misses Japan, so we really want to visit there again, but it’s really heartbreaking that tourists can’t enter. Let’s all hope that everyone will be welcome again soon! 🙏
Whyyyyyyyyyy
Can't wait for Tourism to come back to Japan. Need to visit there again haha
Congrats on 10 years🎉. Keep it up
A fraud in Japan!       Jk love you Chris
Perfect timing on this video…. When you consider the recent izakaya incident on you guys biking  stream.
Perfect scapegoat
Let’s go! A new video! My day is saved now!
Was this the video that you was trying to publish on Connor's livestream?
Hello British fellow
Q&A Time :)
Hope you know your affability keeps on growing
Good thing I dont have any money to travel anyways

Awesome! Was just catching up on the last vlogs. Good timing! 😎
Don't worry Chris! I like you, I think you're a nice person.
A boiiii in JAPANNN
Ask abroad videos are always a treat!
As someone who went to japan every year before the pandemic,it's much easier and sadder to see the racism unfortunately😔
