Fucks a choclate twist
Idk why I was expecting it to sell more British items!! 😂😂😂
Stay close to Jesus his way is the best 🎉❤
Costco sells food for families of at least like 6. I cannot imagine finishing any of their hot dishes by myself.
The United Kingdom 🇬🇧
Your aversion to corndogs is a complete shame. You need that in your life-- just don't microwave it.
That Costco is wayyy better than the lame one I have in Minnesota :/
Ok we have Costco
i saw the turkey pinwheels in the cart, i literally cannot leave costco without getting those 💛
The chocolate, carrot cake, red velvet cake from Costco is the best!
❤❤❤❤❤ The way u love costco is the best 😂 we want more of this
Snappers are called turtles in the US and are yum!
I miss my non broken tummybox I want to eat it allll 🧡
Come on. We know you ate more than one pain chocolat and more than one cronut.
I'm watching this from Seattle, WA which is just across the lake from Kirkland, hometown of Costco. Still can't get over that it is international now
It’s comforting to know Costco looks exactly the same everywhere. I love Costco too! 😄💖
Those Jalapeno crisps are delicious 🤤
Being called a cherub and a buttercup has really improved my day 🥰
Never been to Costco, just curious how much is the membership?
Nooooooo you have to try broccoli salad bag from Costco the best salad I’ve ever ever had!! So crunchy and lovely sweet onion sauce oh my it’s just the best!!! You got to try it x
Grace booth in the UK 🇬🇧
Grace booth
Please tell me where that fluffy clothing is from at the start!
6:41 that’s what she said
Queen is literally underrated
A HOT WATER?
I don’t have a Costco where i live but i always hear how people say it’s so good
I love your hoodie
I think Grack's editing style has evolved to become very unique to her videos. I know Grack think's not much of it bc she just uses basic editing but it has its unique appeal. It's things I've seen before, but very Grackle. Engaging. Comforting. Comedic.
I hope Costco sponsors you!!
"Can I marry cake ?🎂" Girl! You are an absolute hoot. ✌💚
I actually saw you a few months ago in BoxPark. You were with some people and I was too shy to say anything xD but it was awesome to see you and you help inspire me with baking <: ♥   edit: that costco carrot cake is amazing :D
so fascinating how she thinks the portions of the pizza and the sizes of the packaging are fascinating while it's all normal in the us
You are so greedy
where is this costco located? we don’t have half the items you showed here
british people saying fillet🤮
Costco pizza is horrible
Happy birthday!! I would love to see a diabetic/ sugar free day of eating again, as it has been a while!
This is a very calming yet entertaining video! Costco food looks so good
The way I get a jacket potato every time if they offered it in America
Next time you go to Costco Try the baconnaise and put it on a jacket potato it's the best it's in the freezer part in a Tupperware box.
This is the best costco ad I've ever seen
i just ate crunchy corn at the start of this video lol
Every single childhood birthday I went to including mine had Costco cakes so I absolutely despise them now. Every single event had either the red velvet, carrot or chocolate cake so again not a fan anymore
The croduts are so good from Costco!
My first time in Costco my mum didn’t realise some items are a set price per kilo etc.. she thought she got 5kg of of cheese for £6 but it was £35 🥲
those pesto flatbread things are AMAZING
I totally know what you’re talking about at 3:47, I feel that way about Target and Starbucks lol 😂
I still can't believe that the hotdog is still £1.50🤪
Grace - when you were describing Costco, you sounded  just like Holly-go-lightly in Breakfast in Tiffany’s when she was describing Tiffany’s
Happy birthday grace!
Feliz Cumpleanos Chica Bonita! 🎉 🎈 🎂 🥳  That’s awesome that you guys have Inka corn at Costco in the UK! I just looked it up over here in California and they aren’t in stock over here. 😞 You should try making some Peruvian 🇵🇪 dishes. My favorite is ceviche, llomo saltado, and Tallarin verde. 💕💕💕
carrot cakes 😭😭😭
That Carrot Cake looks SO Gud!
Happy birthday 🎂🥳🎉
I could never bite into a whole apple,  that way 1:54, my teeth would nag.  Non American /British here; could s/o explain the COSTCO membership/card-carrying situation?
Ugh the worst dessert ever lol carrot cake I cried inside. But great video as always.
Those pain au choc's are my best dang favourite treat in the whole wide world. They just hit the right spot
How are you so thin? I would eat half of this and gain 20 pounds! Love you and your channel.
Happy Belated Birthday Grace! I hope you had a wonderful birthday. 🎉 The Costco carrot cake is my favorite too.
How are you wearing an oodie in the summer oh myyyyy
It blows my mind you're able to eat so much junk in one day. I'd be done after that "mid morning snack" 🤢
I was hoping you’d review the mini wraps I see them all the time. ALSO you should’ve bought your bother the chocolate he wanted lol
I also love that corn
is it easy to sign up to Costco
I’m so glad you said the first two didn’t wow you because I would have gone and eaten the two boxes in their entirety If they slammed
Anyone want carrot cake now? But I have to admit I wouldn't have waited that long for Costco pizza LOL
Your Costco is massive. Ours is so tiny.
you have dinner super early! in France we eat between 7.30 and 8.30pm ^^
Grace this is going to sound really silly but it surprised me a little that Costcos in England have Aberdeen Angus cottage pies because I live in Aberdeen and I always thought that they must use whatever beef is local HAH I was wrong....
Grace you should totally do a taste test of all the Costco cakes! Like the bday cake review but all different Costco flavours
Costco isn’t down south. It looks q great store.. those containers are massive
Happy birthdayyy
I just wanna know how do you stay fit despite all of these tasting videos.
It's been bugging me for ages what car you drive? I've been trying to figure it out from the interior but I can't work it out! X
Prices look banging for what you get
Not one Costco I've ever been in offered Black Angus Cottage Pie.  If they had, I'd probably eat there every day.  I guess you REALLY wanted that slice of pizza....
The irony of Grace wearing a soda shirt when she doesn’t like sodas 😂
Another video idea with rising food costs and your love of supermarkets,  review which supermarket is the most affordable
I'd like you to do a budget cooking challenge but test yourself with how creative you can be not just live off beans on toast.
I would love to see you do a recipe by the Hebridean baker! X
I would recommend buying apples when they're more in season, they will taste so much better!! They're in season for months and can then be stored throughout the winter, just right now is the worst time for eating apples 😋🍎
love the gro pro :)
Does anyone know where her tops from ? X happy belated birthday Grackle !! 💗
so random but are your parents in Liverpool? just walked past a guy that looked exactly like father booth haha
When her hoodie is up it looks like she was cute, fuzzy  ears
Carrot cake is everyone's fave at my house, me (the nanny), dad, mum, 5-year-old ... The 19 month old hasn't had it yet but I think he will have it for his second bday!
Please do a video making and trying korean corn dogs :)
Grace will forever be my comfort YouTuber. She is so wholesome. Happy Belated Birthday Grace x
Your calendar already on August - its still July here in Somerset haha you are literally the future (also you are the future, grace for PM)
happy birthday grackle!! wonderful video , wish you the best!
🧡🧡
I thought you were going to eat at the food courts for 24hrs!! You gotta go back and only eat at their food court!
You can only go to Costco at 11AM?  Huh??  That’s an odd membership restriction.
Costco in England looks better food wise 😋
12:04 I thought those wedges were horrible! Mine were kinda soggy 🤢
Love costco, but I can spend a fortune in there
Never been to Costco and I love carrot cake so I really need to go.
the calendar on your kitchen wall being august '22 threw me off😂
I wish you’d care about the animals, Grace. If you went vegan, you could inspire so many.
SAD
Wow Grace, are you living in the future?? 😱  (your calendar is showing August 2022 😄)
I have only recently come across your channel and wow. Literally like so therapeutic I haven't stopped watching since yesterday! I love it! The way you say "texture" gets me every time haha!
Are you implying when you leave Costco you are harmed
What car do you have? Thought it was only small
Sorry, can you tell me if Costco is worth it financially and if the food and produce are good? Wanna try but not sure. Thanks
The white and strawberry ones of the donut balls are 👌🏼👌🏼
Wow you eat pure healty stuff
have you tried flipz before? chocolate coverd pretzels!!!! delishhhhh!!! there are plenty other flavors as well:DD
Love to see you Grackle 😁 Happy birthday 🎂
I think I’ve done this challenge without trying to😂
Now I really want to see Grace eat a corn dog!!
It’s Cobb salad for the American influencers 😂
Please do a video where you try and eat zero waste/no plastic for the week!
Thanks Grace for another great video.  Why is your calendar flipped to August 2022 as it’s still July 2022 when the video came out?
as an american, i eat salad every other day
6:50 please finish your sentence
Happy Birthday to you x (mine is today🙂)
Ouhh grack I’d love to know what Costco card you have?? I can’t get one because I don’t have a job in the sector they require you to have😭
I have never been to Costco, I feel like I am missing out!!! Please do another video trying things that you have never had from Costco for the day!!
That Costco Korean chicken is actually so good!
Happy birthday Grace 🎂 🥳 😘❤❤💖💖
Only videos of food ?  change something , you are boring , if you want follwers do something creative like when you sleepted in your back yard , i am italian so excuse my gramer , you are my friend but change your videos try for example to stay a day whithout a smartphone or an all nighter
I've not been to costco so far, and if I have to wait an hour  in a queue I wont be going either
I wonder Costco in Japan and in the uk have different taste of pastries, and ready meals. I’m so sure that sushi would be different cos looks already different😂 even that amount of sushi doesn’t look like Costco🤔
Happy Birthday dear Grackle ! Thanks for all your videos !🙂🤗
Please try a week where you only eat and cook with locally sourced food!
Happy birthday Grace!  As to the whole free sample thing, they tend only to do samples on weekends (and then generally on pay day weekend/ first weekend of the month). I think you went during the week when they don't have so many customers, they put samples out when they have higher volumes of customers
My mum took me to Costco for the first time recently and i loved it! I didn't get as much as i wanted (she wouldn't let me) plus i live alone so i have to balance out what i get. But i absolutely LOVED their cookies, and pineapple fingers! I was just amazed by how cheap everything was but how big it all was! I also have no idea how you kept eating as i got a BBQ chicken pizza slice and sundae, i basically had nothing else for the rest of the day haha
I just want to say that corndogs are a revelation in the hot dog palate. You are right not to eat a frozen corn dog, though, fresh made is the way to go.
I love the way you describe Costco, you sound like Louie Anderson’s character from the show Baskets ☺️
you need to get the OMGs next time!! they are Canadian and SOOO good!!
HAPPIEST OF BIRTHDAY'S TO YOU GRACKLE! Let's all celebrate this legendary Queen 👏💙🎂🎉🎈🎁
I thought you would be eating at Costco all day. Samples and hotdogs. Lol.
Up to a third of the way in, I just assumed the location of this video was in America. Then I noticed the price tags.    ....... 😳   As an American, I do not see the appeal ... Especially for cheap baked goods. That sushi isn't real sushi either << but that's just a drop in the bucket of what is Costco
Americans do eat a lot of "fancy" salads. I don't prefer salads as meals but they are popular.
All the premaide food looks so much better than here in California!!!!!  The sushi looks edible!  Healthy sandwiches!
No, YOU’RE an actual legend ♥️
Sultanas in a carrot cake 🤢 Gross!!
Best part?  🧡🧡🥕🥕🎂...Happy Birthday to you!
Grace! Buy Envy apples. You will love them if you love pink lady.
Happy birthday!! <3
are your parents in a cult church?
:)
Fun vlog!  Happiest of Birthdays to you Grace!! 🎂🍷We actually DO have Boom Chicka Pop in the U.S. and YES the bag is as big as half of my body and YES I have bought it LOL...have to look in our Costco for a few items you showed and see if we have them 💐
Grace, I think you’d love corn dogs
Grackle where is the top from !! I love it
Happy birthday!!! Grace you would LOVE a corndog. If you like hotdogs, give the corn dog a try. They are an American County Fair specialty!
Those toffee clusters are literally my favorite candy I've found at costco. Amazing
💓❤️‍🔥💜❤️💞💝💘💖
Happy belated bdayyy💙
I NEED that carrot cake 😍😍😍😍😍
Your energy just makes everything better!
Found you just before lockdown and u were literally my binge during lockdown really happyyyy to seee you have another great year 🥰🥰🥰
If you haven’t tried the frozen prawn gyozas from Costco please do next time you go! One of my faves!!
Happy birthday! 🎂🎁🛍🎉🎈🎉🎈🎉
The apple was "floury," I take it. I heard it as "flowery" at first, and some apples do taste flowery to me. I'm more likely to call an apple with that texture "mealy," but floury is a good way of putting it.
Costco carrot has my heart 💛😂
This OMG clusters are so good!
Happy birthday for yesterday! You make everything better!
HAPPY BIRTHDAY GRACE!!!!!!!!! i absolutely loved this video and had no idea they had costco in the UK! i thought they were only in the US! next time, try the mac & cheese if they have it. it’s incredible!!!!!!
I was that viewer who recommended you the enchiladas! I’m sad you didn’t enjoy them but I can’t believe you remembered, made my day 🧡
That looks very similar to my Costco in Thurrock! The street style tacos are so good! Their chicken and veg gyozas are so nice and cook up very well. Also can’t beat a Costco birthday cake and you need to have the corner piece!
Happy birthday 🎉🥳
you ate a corn dog in one of your christmas foods videos
Love from New Zealand!! 💞💞💞
Surely sticky toffee pudding is an exception to the only acceptable desserts are chocolate rule?!
Just the title deserves a like.
This was deffo one of Graces dream and best videos she’s ever made!
I so wish that I could get a costco card 😓
everytime my mum sends me back off to uni i get a bag of pink lady apples. they really are elite
happy birthday!!!
Happy birthday !! You don’t know how happy it makes me when I see you posted a new video and thank you for being my fav youtuber hehe <33
Costco has to be the worst place for plastic packaging!  In fact what would be a great video- if you review supermarkets use of plastic?
Floury! Finally a way to describe that awful apple texture.
Lakeside Costco?
I find that carrot cake dry!!!!!
Nothing can beat a Costco birthday cake! Or even their cheesecakes or carrot cake or those giant cupcakes🤤🎂🧁
happy birthday grack!! I was just thinking when I was watching the part of you and Jesse shopping in Costco how much Jesse sounds like papa booth!! they sound SO similar wow ❤️
It'd be great to see a dairy free/vegan at costco video. Really curious as to what the UK one has😊
Oooh could you do a Costco vegan day? I would love to see what they have!!
You should have chosen the omg chocolate bites. They are phenomenal, addictive
I don’t understand Costco ? Can you not just go in there ?
The person tailgating her 😠
Costco's outside the USA should just double as Embassies, that was exceptionaly American.
Oh em geeeeeee   My favourite things ever is the quesidillas. Every time I'm there we buy them!!
Happy Happy Birfday
Mvl the Caesar salad is REALLY good
Happy birthday Grace 🎂💙
Happy birthday 🎂 🥳 🎉 🎈 🎁 🎊
Love to see your passion for Costco. I started to go to Costco because of you introducing me. Great video!
Happy birthday! 🥳
Like almond paste pains au chocolat, they are the best!
Happy Birthday Grace!!!!
Who's been a passenger in your car?? The passenger headrest is almost out the sunroof 🤣🤣🚙❤️
All I’m gonna say is I NEEDED this video today
Happy birthday grace!!! 💙 p.s. salads are a huggeeee thing in America, very annoying 😆
Happy Birthday!!! Yuck. I can't abide carrot cake.
Happy belated birthday 🎉🎂 hope you had a great day ❤️
The only time I've ever been to Cosco I went wild and just bought a huge jar of pickles and two big jars of artichoke hearts 😂 I feel like it would be the end of me if I went back!!
The Pufflie is back, although Grace, we're in Summer, experiencing intermittent heatwaves🤣🥵😜 you feeling ok Hun? Lol (just a joke/banter....). Don't come at me in the comments!!
I can’t be the only one who thinks Jessie’s voice is identical to Papa Booths, when the camera wasn’t on him in Costco my brain automatically registered it as Papa Booth speaking 😂😂
For breakfest I buy the plain fresh goat cheese and put fruit on it.  The seasoned chicken wings are good, in the freezer section.  My niece buys the sun dried tomatoes and uses them in various receipies.  If you cook a lot try the non sodium 21 spice found in the spice section.  We use it instead of salt.
Happy Birthday! Thanks for sharing your kindness and joy with the world. You make Mondays brighter!
I missed Jesse so much. Feel like we haven’t seen our brother booth in a MINUTE lol
Strange question ... why is your calender on August lol 😆
All that food looked amazing
Happy Birthday 🎉🎂💕
I hope you had a lovely birthday 🎉 🎂 🥳 Thank you for this very entertaining video. I do love a browse around Costco xxx
BUZZED for this video, so relevant to my life rn XD My boyfriend is coming over from the USA this weekend and love Costco.. So I've told him that I'll take him to the Costco in the UK for Costco food and bargains lol
I love you so much Grackle! Have a good birthday celebration and hope you have the best rest of the year ❤🙏🏼🕺🏻
Hbd 🥳
A crisp shaped like a wedge but with garlic bread something flavor just crushed my brain
Which branch was this please. I love those sandwiches you showed at the beginning but our branch haven’t had them for such a long time.
That prawn soup is amazing! They were doing taste tests of it one time 😋
If anyone wants to plan their next international vacation based on Costco offerings: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3f8LqK0MqqA
Loved this, some of my fav content from you recently Grack! Keep em coming… would love to see more of what English restaurants have to offer for 24 hour meals (coming from an American)
Happy Birthday dear Grack It's a Costco attack! Sure you're getting old but your heart's gold For cheer, you've got the knack!
Happy Birthday hope you have an awesome day with loved ones. Btw where did you get that fruit oversized hoodie. It looks so comfortable
Happy birthday love
Happy birthday! 🥳 We don't have a Costco in the Southwest, Devon. 😮‍💨 Carrot Cake is my absolute favourite, but I live alone, so only eat it when out with others and where I can get a one-person slice. That delicious cake made me drool.
I’m so glad you went for the snappers.  I’m such a people pleaser I would have acquiesced to Jesse’s choice to make him happy. You go girl! 😂
That’s cake. Damn. Yum
How are you wearing that c Comfy in the heat wave!!! I'm dying where I'm from and it's 32°c with the humidity 🙃
This is such a fun video! I dont know if English costco has it but the costco fettuccini alfredo is incredible, would recommend. Your videos always bring a smile to my face!
I love seeing what is available at your Costco deli counter! I want to try all of it!!
Try the corn dog! They are yummy. I haven't been to a costco but I do so at Sam's. They have a lot of the same products.   I love they have scan and go.  I scan my purchases and don't have to wait in line to check out.
Yayyy! Great videos 😍 And Happy Birthday!
Happy birthday Grace 🎉🎉🎊🎊🎊🎊🎂🎂🎂 have an amazing day 😃😃😃😃
Happy birthday queen!!!
Happy Birthday!!!!!!!!!!
Now I want some carrot cake,🎈🎂🎉Happy Birthday Grack 🎂 🥳 🎉
Happy birthday Grace!
Happy birthday Grace, hope you had a good one, its my birthday tomorrow.
Thank you much love xx happy birthday xx
Why is your Costco so much better than mine? Newcastle/Gateshead Costco did not have all of this cool stuff!
Happy birthday!
You should do a week
Happy Birthday, hope you have a wonderful day 💐🎉🥳🎁
You NEED to try the Costco burritossss
Happy Birthday 🎂🥳. Costco is everything!!
Omg the fake American accent 🚩
Flying to the uk to steal your jumper- also happy birthday 🥺❤️❤️❤️
I still haven’t stepped into a Costco store but this makes me want to go!
We don't have Costo in Northern Ireland, I shall live vicariously through you today 💕
Happy Birthday 🎂
The world is always shining brightly when watching you 🙈
I am SO jealous that y’all have sushi at your Costco!!!
Happy birthday Grackle!! Thank you for always bringing a smile to my face ❤️
i was watching your tiktoks and you posted!!! its a cosmic grackle sign!!!
Love your videos!!💛
Woohoo can’t wait!
