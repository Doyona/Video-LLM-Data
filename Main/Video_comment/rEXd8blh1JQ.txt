What car should we do next??
That car is so clean for it's age damn
6:03 Do you have a video with that mannequin build? I searched for some tags but haven't found anything on your channel.  Cheers for all your work!
James "the Pump" Pumphrey looking like Matty Matheson in this episode
The fantech in the background 😂
I felt like a Proud Father the whole Show 😂😂🙆🏿‍♂️😍😍😍😍. Proud of you Son 😂👏🏿
Bro left his girl at the shop …
Subscriber Mechanic hindered by not having watching all the UNFORGETTABLE and tearjerking HiLo Nissan Z series!! EVERYONE ELSE who watched all the series is STILL having flashbacks and NIGHTMARES😢 I too lost my shit when you all broke down driving the Twins down to the track to tune and race. 😢😢
Ayyyeee congrats Vinh!
The thing that drives me nuts the most about these videos is this: The very first thing I would check, no matter what, is that there is oil in the car. That's just a good habit to have.
a 2009 mustang! 🚗
Could he ask for an obd code scanner?
The boys wanted him to win that car. Love it
Spark plug or ECU yes, this is a kid😂😂😂 13:18
Check the goddamn fuel pump and yes, I’m a kid 6:56
Dope video!
No way he just win the car, thats crazy😮
Guys not bad of a mechanic I’d give him a job
sponsors is a instant click away for me i dont pay youtube premium to watch ads
we shure about this "no relation to Mr Diesel?"
can i get a 370Z
U gotta a jack 😈evil laugh😂😂😂
Dangggg can I have a Nissan z?
James is gone now its not the same.
Gateway check the fuse
Dammm donut got fat
if they have to fix it, you're not giving them a car, you're giving them debt. if it's gonna cost thousands to get it functional and certified, then its not free at all. unless someone has the money to make it a project car, then that's a different story
like subscribe
U just gained a new subscriber
I like how they added the jack stand at 13:30 so no one complained about safety but the jack stand isn't even holding the car lol.
First video I ever watch from you, definitely subscribing - looking forward to learn more about cars
F&$# yeah love the show I'd love a barn yard challenge....it's my specialty
What happens if someone who knows a little but with no mechanic experience wants to compete.
I would have been far more worried about cut wires. Imagine how easy it would be to open a wiring loom, cut one wire, and put the loom back over it.
It actually got me smiling when he started the car. Awesome video ❤
Why count down when you see the man is trying to focus? Just tell him when his time is up.
Happy for the man for winning the car challenge. Shows with just a couple parts you can fix. A perfectly good car to run good again.
unconsciently learning
He is Asian sooo.. 😅😂
✨
Ehat a great produced video, me myself have very little clue on mechanics of cars but have some knowledge and have a good chemistry knowledge and this learned me alot
Jesus is king
Love you guys but I'm in australia don't think I'll ever be coming to work with use my little honda single cam spent 20k all my money and still got the d16 in it haha you guys could legit make my dream com re true with putting a better motor in bur yeah I'd never get to meet you guys watch your videos all the time
This video was so cool
Do that to my dad and he will own every car thats infront of him. Hes a god when it comes to cars. Theres nothing my pop cant fix.
After watching this episode, I’m seeing y’all really finessed bro on the corvette😂😂😂
James has always reminded me of Thomas Delonge.
I just repaired my "totaled" 2013 passat tdi. The only thing I used the scanner for was to erase the codes from the deer impact.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
finally!!!!!! A great and awesome channel!
Bet 🙌🏽
That's great, legend mode use a jeep grand cherokee wk2 and sabotage it. Let the games begin...
Can anyone fix my car? I have a 2012 Chevy Cruze Eco, 136,000 miles. Starts fine but has a rough idle and sometimes turns off on me. Once I get it going on the freeway it's completely fine. I haven't noticed a pattern with it, the engine rumbles rough in the hot/cold, day/night, rain/dry. I changed the spark plugs, engine filter, cabin filter, mass airflow sensor. And no check engine light.
Fun
Come fix my truck id be just happy with that .great idea tho
What a cool idea for a video (if you’ve got the money to do it)
Are you guys still doing this? I would love to try out for it
If he resell that 350. It ll be a easy $10k
This is fun. I work on robots and I understand time sensitivity and making mistakes because you're trying to get it up and running asap.
He fixed it, now he has to work at home on the oil leaks,ecu faults,tranny leaks,head gasket, water pump, and a joyful time of tight spaces. Enjoy your nissan
Sick vid
This is such a great vid. Rewards effort knowledge and loyalty
By no means am I diminishing his accomplishments here, but seeing what this guy had to help improve his chances compared to the other guy with the Corvette... Really makes me feel like the corvette guy was being set up to fail which is really saddening.
"An AD!?" lol Donut Media doesn't have Youtube Premium?
brand used car! Awesome.
Agree with me or not stock 350z was ugly look. Still better of 240z and 280z
Bring this series back
He won won?????😂😂😂
He’s a great mechanic, wish I could use him for my car
i like it how he’s feeling really generous this episode but then the corvette one he just doesn’t do anything else
man one time it was just the little switch for the clutch and all i needed was a literal dime and speed tape
When you guys going make a new episode of this?
Yuhhh donut editors listen to arc de soleil!!
I wanna fix a car
goes on google "what did these idiots do to this car?" and it tells him everything you did
1.Turbulence 2. Bed for 3. Reduce ft. Bardi Oceantrenches 4. As above so bellow 7. Light mind ft. Gen DVN cult 5. Sound bite  6. Buster call 8.  Last Battle ft Jabby VEXED X. Glitch X. Oblivion
*drives home without plates* 😂
Im only 18 and im the main diagnostic guy at my shop on top of i do all the engine and transmission work. Doing something like this would be the coolest thing in the world
Chrisfix: hold my helmet
Donut, Drewpeacock and Illiminate are the only reason why i sometimes davble with the idea of even setting foot in Cali
LETS GOOOOOO NICE JOB
Wish I would’ve watched this video sooner
Keep doing these types of videos they are super interesting and very informative and really fun im a new subscriber because of these videos
I’m 16 and would like a shot it would also make good content to have a young viewer on the channel in my opinion 😁
I would have guessed them all right away, I owned one and almost everything broke on mine so knew my way around it haha.
I just don't really like "small tips" that basically are full solutions. Yes, without them more people would fail, but you just could gave them something else.  Because now it's too predictable and because of that not that interesting to watch as could be
Please make a video about spark plug blowout and gapping!!!
One of the hardest things for me after my timing belt went, was doing the work myself. The crank position sensor was replaces and she wouldnt fire. Found out the metal sprocket the sensor reads the teeth of had one bent... bent it back, boom she fired up! Pretty proud of myself for taking it apart and back together 5 times myself... lol timing is an annoying job!
Please, more series like this one
You don't have to go through the hard times of your life alone, let Jesus Christ help you through it all.
Omg you let his wife sit there for moral support ❤
I'm glad you guys set the contestants up for success rather than making it nearly impossible for them to win. Some channels would make failure inevitable so they can milk it getting more episodes out of the vehicle. Mad respect
Friggin awesome! Toyota Supra next!
This guy definitely deserves this he earned it
Pick me and my dad 🥺
bro said brand new 2004 nissian 350z how can something 20 years old be new lol
ow fuck.. this is fun, this is a mans werld, continue to make vids for us. DONUT!
Y’all gotta do more videos like this.
I know this video is a bit old but I've seen a few of this series and you know I'm not the most mechanically inclined but I would love a chance at a 67 z/28 or a 69 ss camaro it's always been my dream car
This is a such a fun, brilliant idea. Kudos.
It's like he knows you guys just by watching on YouTube
I wish I got the chance I could really use a car for work
i cant fix it but id love to have one
All idiots...would had.me.some Free cars super fast.
This video brought me back to a 3 day endeavor when I was 21 on the 89 Pontiac Grand Prix  owned at the time.  The Crankshaft Position Sensor was the 1st sort of step-by-step, "follow the schematic" troubleshoot I had ever done.
corvett c4 zr1  😇
come on guys give them a challenge range rover sport 5.0 supercharged drive train issue.
please give me a chance to fix one of these cars preferably a cadillac escalade because i like working on larger vehicles easy to get under and reach motor plus i have a big family im from nc so if you come this way im game..
Which car is this?
3 people with the same cars and same problems😮😮😮
Was he aloud to put it on the diagnostic computer?
Waiting on the day they offer to fly me out so I can participate 😂
Just seeing this but great idea
Who won the corvette?
Replaced parts and won in the end..
Let me go
Can you give me a 370z?
This got me a little emotional at the end 🥲
a fun fast car
When James said this video saved some one’s life he isn’t wrong. Been having a super rough couple months and my girl broke up with me a couple days ago and I have been really leaning into your videos the last few days and it’s been the only time where I am not thinking about things. So thank you James. Thank you team
9:26 14:23 ADHD
I'm in I want to do this
Watched my first video I seen of y'all's was when you guys engine swapped on a $500 Honda Civic and really enjoyed it! I really enjoy the content you guys have here. With that said, I just recently purchased a 2011 Scion TC from a car dealership that was a trade in with a long car fax lol. Although it was in a wreck that made the car unable to drive off the scene and had to be towed away it runs fine now and comes with an aftermarket exhaust which sounds really nice. It's also my first manual, it's really fun to drive and was wondering how I could improve it's performance and thought I would ask if you guys could do an episode or series about that type of vehicle. Would really love to see what you guys could accomplish with it! If not so big I still enjoy your guys's stuff and I will be liking and subbing most definite! Thank you and keep up the great work you guys really have something special here 😎👍🏽
I would have anxiety having a timer on while diagnosing a car
This dude got spoon fed this car compared to the corvette one
I need a mechanic like this
Please do an everything you need to know on the Lexus GS400.  Thank you 😁
First b bnb it nthennman 2 pairs of pants
man Have me do this in a K series car Swap or not 0_o      !!!!!!!!
Is Vinh a Filipino?
He's gonna be replacing that autozone sensor within a year😂
Why is this not a game show already 8)
I got a donut borla exhaust ad before this video
Work on a Maserati!!!!!!!!!!  Maserati's are known to be overpriced and full of cheap factory crap parts that will break down.  How can you take that car and make it a "GOOD" car now?  Meaning that all the things that should go wrong with it, won't now because all the bad parts have been removed.  That's the only way I would buy or own a Maserati.  "Making A Reliable Maserati!"
WOW!!!!!  I feel like I know sooooooooooo much about cars now!  Gezzzzzzzzzzzzz!  Great show!
Choose my dad!!! He would ABSOLUTELY LOVE to do this! And I wanna see if he can actually fix a car that won’t start!!!
This was a great video idea!
Get a golf one velocity from south Africa
Instead of google, should have the option of consulting the Haynes guide (a physical book) but you have to find it in a separate room
Hell yeah, this one ruled. Good work Vin
I am from Philippines! Watching all your exciting and educational videos! I am using a kia pride1995, in your country it is known by the name ford festiva. Please do a video about it , like changing engine with smaller but new modeled engine.  Can youndo that?  I am excited!
You guys need to get @BudgetMechanicHawaii out for one of these!
OBD2 would've been my first move after the battery, it lets you know what system is down and possibly where.
Love it
awesome.
what is his @? no homo
can youguy fix my head gasket? for free btw
awesome show...
I’d volunteer my 2019 f150
Can we get more of these videos? This was really good.
Y'all should buy a 4Runner and have somebody fix that up
I hope this guy can fix it :)
Donut media doesn’t pay for YouTube (they see ads before videos) 😂😂😂
I'm curious, who was the woman on the couch?
If they have extra time let them install additional parts from Donut!
Congratulations this awesome
Haha, obviously Google is a tech's best friend :)
When he left his girlfriend wasn’t in the car 🫢
This episode was a great way for new car enthusiasts to learn about diagnosing a car. The infographics were great and that’s something that other car channels don’t do. If you guys got that guy that explains how stuff works to do how to diagnose a car I think it’d be a hit after this series!
I’m curious how many people fail this challenge before one succeeds and then donut posts?
I wanna try this
I so want a chance to win one. my favorite car are the Z's / S's
Love you guys videos I would love this
he should join donut
Ironically watching this as the main problem with my 02 civic was the crankshaft position sensor, bought a brand new one, turns out to be faulty,💀
I bought a 2007 350z last year…one of the first things I checked was the clutch safety switch. It was “made” with scotch tape and cardboard. This video saved me from a  $7 part that potentially would have caused me hours of frustration and an unknown amount of $$ shotgunning random parts hoping for a fix.
The monologue at 15:00 was sooooo sean evans inspired. Someone in the crew likes hot ones
So hard to pick multiple random faults that make now sense with zero diagnostic equipment. In reality this would never happen. He went really well and I'm so pumped you gave him a nudge on the crank angle sensor. great show!!!!!!!!!!
Love that you called it a 'brand new' 18 year old car.
I like the idea and content but y’all annoying Af
i wanna play!!
what if while he was tryna fix it something else on the car broke
A car needs 5 things Air Fuel Spark Compression Timing
who came here because the 4th part wasn’t on tiktok😂
350 is the first car im going to get
Honda S2000 should be next. Ill come in for it.
He should have had to do it outside in parking lot in the sun like everyone else that breaks down.
Get Chris fix on this!
Did he have access to a scantool? Best way to know the crank sensor is bad if it's not visually broken would be to check if it shows rpms.
Saw a clip on tiktok and was like shit, im sitting at my desk why dont i just watch the youtube video. XD anyways great video
That clutch safety switch is something I've never seen or heard of. Is that a thing only on new cars?
On the bright side, that is more than 100kph. I come from a metric country and that is some insane speed
what a car need to start is , compression fuel and spark , not air you dumbasses , when have you seen a car not starting cuz it does not get any air 🤦🏻‍♂️
🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹
you need timing
this dude cant count it was 10 mins and xx seconds not 11
personal opinion: I love learning about cars from the channel but all the sound effects and "gimmick" sounds added throughout the video makes it very hard for me to watch through, also embarrassing to play it out loud. This is just my personal opinion I would like to reflect I'm sure it doesn't apply to all audience. Thank for the production, Donut.
Man, I just started working in the automotive field, and I want to do this with these guys, see the difference between a rookie mechanic versus a professional
To be honest, there could have been a LOT of other things wrong that he didnt even check.  Faulty power distributor, faulty spark plugs, ECU problems, MAP sensor, and like 500 other things. He got fucked over badly to do this challenge and NOT have a computer to access the car's systems.
Man this would be so awesome to give it a shot !!! Congratulations
Typed this comment with a nickel lol
Where is the contact of that mechanic?!?!?! 😂 Nowadays it is hard to find a good mechanic like him
I know nothing about cars so I could be your ultimate to get it running challenge.😀
Shit give me 2 years😂
Hell yeah
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!
Can I try?
Joeyswoll would love this haha
Great video 👍🙏
What kind of mechanic doesn’t carry a penlight on him.
Awesome
no no no air fuel spark AND AND TIMING you can have all three and no start
Simple.  Hook my Z1 scanner up to it. Make a quick fix and start it. Infiniti and Nissan 3.7 and 3.5 so easy to work on.
what if i cant fix a car lol
Bravo
those blue prints are sooo helpful!
ah a fellow milwaukee fastback enjoyer
I wanna see Chris fix play
I really hope they hide a kill switch on one
he did a lot better than i would have props to him
He’s gonna need to swap that duralast crankshaft position sensor for a OEM sensor soon
As a DIY person with my vehicles I do everything I can to make my vehicle reliable & running. Never thought of making a trap car with random things that need to be fixed to run 🤣🤣🥺🫶🏼 awesome content
Never seen this channel. First video and I enjoyed this shit. Subscribed
This is the first time I seen this show and the concept of giving a car away. If they can fix it is pretty cool. But I do think one thing is unfair. If the fixer is asking for the location of a certain part, he should have access to internet or at least have a manual. If you figure it out in his head cuz if his knowledge but never worked on that type of car he should have access to know the location of whatever part.
I liked commented and subscribed  because this video helped me learn something now im hungry for more 😂
Sandro woulda had the whole thing done in 30 min lol
ohhhhh i wanna be on this show. this the only show I've ever wanted to be on lol.
Bravo! Congratulazioni! Regards from Deutschland, Italy, and Morocco! Love guys
you guys could fly me in from Canada and give me something hard
I want a z so bad
This helped me learning about cars so much
Wow!!
Goals!
14:52 😭😭
Not gonna lie yall hit bro with some auto electrician work, yet he’s a auto mechanic….
You definitely need to make this a thing
Ugh...wish I could find a deal like that. Dream 350z and 370z
"I shoulda had a nice amount of fuel shoot up on that crank" - vinh
That mechanic deserves some credit, his diagnostic prowess is unbelievable. I wonder where he works, I'd bring my cars to him and pay extra for his experience.
Ofcourse A Asian Man gonna Make this Car Start.! It’s there Cars they Made them…Amother Scam going on..😆
11 mins and 28 seconds….. bro it’s 10 mins and 28 gone 😂
I can fix it
Why does everyone in this video have a rapist mustache?
If you don’t like bmw stop making vids about them then and go to Porsche or even better Honda since all you talk about is reliability 😒
wait didnt they say they messed with the sensor? now its the gas pump?
Flsahlight wrong part -30 mins
This is such a creative idea!!
Honestly he deserved that car he figured out where everything was without being knowledgeable on the car good mans!
Dude looked like he just finished his shift at work instead of realizing he just got a free car...🤔
That's pretty badass!! But you guys basically told him what to do!!!
They wouldn't try this today with ChatGPT
drip drip
I have to say  doughnut media help me get my neighbors car for free. By doing this concept, and Chris fix to but these gentlemen helped by enforcing the humor in the learning of working on cars
I know I"m late as hell but if my some miracle you bad mofos will see this please do more of this. I loved the explanations and troubleshooting. Ya'll are amazing, I wish I was on west coast lol
Bruh I'm a subscriber and I wouldn't have gotten nothing right lmfao
This is a fu**en $ick show
you wanna do hard modee? there are two ground wires that attach to the top of the engine above the timing cover. disconnect those two grounds and you will have a crank no start
I’m so happy for him, I love the 350z. He’s gonna be driving on style!
Wonderfull content
Easiest way to find out is pull a spark plug and start the car to see if u see/smell fuel and spark at the same time.  But then I'm a mechanic.
do more of these videos!!
A Z-Boy is born
actually you forgot "timing" as the 4th thing it needs to start :v  can i get a car as well now? 😢
Me next
It was low on blinker fluid
This Nissan add every 30 seconds just solidifies the fact that I WILL NEVER BUY A NISSAN.
🤔
Dont agree with engines only needing 3 things, I prefer to use F.A.C.T.S. Fuel, Air, Compression, Timing, and Spark
He just needed a multimeter.
Ironically, I've been eating a lot of donuts lately .
I'm pissed bc I guessed fuel pump and then crank sensor but did I get a new z, nope 😂😂😂
No obd2 allowed?
Make more of these!!!!!
You are awesome guys!!! Huge congrats to Vinh! This was epic!
Fuel pump won’t cause a no crank
I would be like , can I have y’all’s oem scan tool and see codes 🤷🏻‍♂️😂
DO A DIESEL TRUCK OR CAR
Could I bring my mechanic?
The entire time I've been bombarded with Nissan ads every 37 seconds.  I will NEVER buy a Nissan Ariya.  EVER.  That's what you get for interrupting these amazing videos!!!
Do this with me i am handy and ill give it to my employee who walks to work.
My 2003 Ram would start but kept stalling out at stop lights. Ended up being the crank position sensor. I am surprised the car wouldn't start at all with a bad CPS.
Is he trying to be an automotive matti madison
Yooo Donuts, I'm looking for some help if possible. My car's engine has a problem lately, it's rpm is around 500(which is pretty low), I was wondering do yall know what parts correlate to low rpms? i think the AC alternator is also not working if thats additional info, hope yall can helpp 🙏🏻🙏🏻❤
If you ever have a nissan from this era, always assume its the crank position sensor first if the engine doesn't start. Nissans sensors crank sensors were bad and often failed.
Dude this guy was so close and when he started checking the fuel pump he was screwed.... you can hear whether or not your pump is working by turning the ignition. Even if the car doesn't start you can hear the fuel pump prime itself....
Great job
I miss these
I think the funniest thing is just one guy working on the car with like 10 people watching
Bro why tf are there so many ads
Can you buy my 4 Japanese classics & give them away to every car enthusiast who fully restores each one? Link in my bio
I’m pooping
Make a video of the Acura type s
My dream car this is amazing
A cheap  to see if your crank position sensor is reading is to crank the vehicle and pay close attention to the RPMs, if the needle has zero movement the you know its to reading but if it slights moves up then you know it's ok.
350Z Is such a great car. Easy to drive, easy to fix.
Come to milford CT and try this
"giving people a dad if they can find it"
Awsem..
My father and I bought a type r number 61 from this old guy he said he’d taken it to multiple mechanics but couldn’t ever figure it out we replaced the distributor cap and wires and it started right up, we got the car for only 4K finished fixing it up and resold it for 14 at a car meet, I gave half to my father and I put the rest into my 300zx 3in borola’s those garrets.. the signature startup sound pure joy 🤩
Shit, give me a truck and I’ll fix it. I have a Chevy G30 cutaway. It was made into Rv before I bought it to get off street but the dam transmission is bad. Goes reverse but not forward.
Spin off to this idea: fixing cars from Facebook marketplace that say they just need a "this part" then it'll run, bringing that part, then fixing it on-site to see if they were telling the truth.
I love this Channel bro❤️ and I feel happy for my guy too❤️😎
They guy knew Impressed they guy pressure alot
That megaphone is annoying as fuck
Let me get a try at this lol would be cool to meet you guys and try for my own
Keep doing this. It was awesome!
Best Channel
Ok Sam crack
Mr beast more like Mr donut
So glad that he was able to get it up in running. God bless you guys 🤠
This is really teaching me alot
Dudes like I’m walking away with 50k easy
if  you guys find any silvias let me get on one of these videos
I worked on a Toyota diesel HILUX that wouldn't start (a HILUX that won't start?!?). I tore that thing apart. Troubleshooting everything.. Then, I looked down at the E-brake and saw a piece of candybar wrapper inside of the brake sensor. Pulled it out and the truck started right up. Evidently, the foil was enough to send a confusing to the brain box.
Has me thinking my 98 accord might need a new crank shaft position sensor I’ve searched everything 🤔
Gross car I would sell it immediately. They killed this car when they went to 300zx. The 240,260 and 280 were actually good looking
This was a great episode.
Give people a car, if they don't have one
Why wasn't I included in this lol
When can I get a car if I fix it
I need this mechanic 😭😂
Celica gt4
Man, I wish Vihn was a regular on donut now
01 lexus sc430🤣🤣🤣
One of the best videos Donut has ever made, entertaining and informative at the same time!
can they use car diagnostic tool?
Make this a 12 episode series/show asap!! Im not joking. Brilliant. We give you a car if you can fix it? Come on!!! I love it!
bro that scream got me rollin 💀💀
would yall choose a subscriber to help work on his car that had a few problems?
Love this
Wish to play but in oman😭
❤️❤️❤️
2004 and in great shape.
I like this game. Can we get one again
Logically break first? Brother I've never had a fuse be the problem lol always the expensive part.
12:27 cuss word in donut video 🤯🤯
Idk if I would have found the clutch switch 😅
This is an awesome challenge! 👍🏼🤟🏼
Next year I will come to fix car 😁
Knockoff mr beast
That is what happens to alot of people. They either test the wrong part or test it wrong. But the order of "power, air, fuel", is a solid way to get your answer.
Why do you guys keep using shitty 350z’s
hey if you do any VW's id love to come and try
Really enjoyed watching this!  Hope you guys do more of these!
I’m a subscriber but idk anything about cars. So if you select me, it would be lovely to meet you guys, but i would just be standing there dumbfounded with what to do to the car.
This is a really cool series.  Entertaining and informative!
Thanks this gives us idea to remove parts so the cars wouldn't get stolen
i love your guyses video i would love to see a ford expedition but drag/drift lower it it would be crazy to see a giant vehicale like that drifting
I love that he still had time on the clock. I hate when they are like it was down to the wire just for TV shit.
5:33 that sucks
love this 🙌 do a BRZ or FRS 🙏
Cranks sensor, as a mechanic, yeah, he s something else , real deal
the little things
why he kinda sound and look like benny from bennys workshop in gta
Could have easily asked for an obd2 reader
"Only took 11 minutes 28 seconds!"  Good thing you're cute, because basic math certainly isn't your forte.
DO MORE OF THESE! Id rather watch a show of just this than any other show Donut does.
Love this theme. Do more of these.
I really wanted him to win. This is one of my favorite cars. I know it is heavy, and underpowered, I just think it looks cool.
When I drove water truck, we had a problem with the small motor that powered the water pump. My boss in all his anger and hurry desperately trying to get it started out in feild. I told him to check the air filter, and he said that couldn't be the problem since "we never run these in dirty environments". Finally he gave up. I popped the filter cover off, and wouldn't you know it. A little mouse house was in there. Moral of the story. Always check the simple stuff first.
Does he not get a code reader for this?
7.32 million subscribers and they still have ads on their shop computer lol
As a former Nissan owner, I know all about that rubber stopper on the clutch pedal.
hell I need a new project car lmao
you guys should fix up an old Buick Le Sabre.
This was a good episode
Cool episode. I would enjoy more Fix It Episodes. Nice job both contestant and Donut!
I’m watching this thinking I’d be dead without a scan tool and Google. I’m glad they had mercy on him.
LETS GOOOOOOO
This was a good one. Vinh seems like a solid dude. If I didn’t do mine already, I would def bring my shit to him to work on
bro idk why but any time you used that awful telecom system i rode my lolllercoaster 🤣
A clean Crx HF and pick me
Toyota sequoia 😊
Like how these guys have play cars
I been watchen this channel for years and never received nothing
maybe make this a series and if they don’t win it then it goes to next person but with an upgrade added which can be another video in separate series of car upgrades
Best series on YouTube!
The clutch safety switch is a bad idea because one of the advantages of manual transmission is that you can move the car a few meters in case of emergency using the starter motor only.
Such a heart warming video
I love this, This is straight out of the Ford AAA competition and is an awesome video idea.
Sweet loved this one!!
This was cool  Do more of this.
What a moron! It would’ve taken me 47 minutes flat. I don’t even know what a car is.
Damn the integra episode  had me convinced i could do one of these but this one i never even heard of 3/4 of the parts 😂😂
Hire that guy, he knows more than you 🤣
love this shiii
This was a dope idea, hope to see more episodes like this
Troubleshooting a defective car is one thing, troubleshooting a sabotaged car something wholy else...
This was literally the most useful car video I've ever seen.....  Simple to the point troubleshooting explanation and even had animation.  Great job V
Awesome content
Hire him
Stop making videos your channel used to informative and great. Now it’s just stupid
That host is disgusting so annoying
Plot twist, he doesn't know how to drive a manual.
um that was ultra cool guys, i would have completely missed that crank sensor, good job to all!
E420 w211 Mercedes... It's a rwd v8 so it should be fun.
Only OE engine sensors should be used.
No scanner or wiring diagrams can be used?
Just for the record, I'm subbed...Have been.  My car's rough...Because it's a base model New Beetle.  That said, love you guys. Lol
Somebody consulted Mr. Jimmy Beast guy it seems.
Thanks I learned something new
Wtf did i just watched ?
GT86 and remove the oxygen sensor , cut a random wire in the ECU wiring and unplug the ignition key slot
if you just gave me a dongle  I'd have it lmao
2 hours of namekian time
Loved how he drove off without a license plate 😂
Should of asked my brother to fix it. but yes too many bad words.
donut media is new topgear
Why wasn’t he allowed to use a scanner?
I diagnosed a crank position sensor in a Mitsubishi. Replacing it meant removing the cambelt. Was a 4 hour job in the desert heat. It ran for a couple seconds then blew the new sensor. Somehow the disk on the crant pulley that ran through the sensor was bent and it'd chew up the sensors. Sold the car cheap and bought a Toyota 🤷‍♂️
I’d love to see them do a HiLow muscle car daily driver drag car   Maybe with some budget mopar 2005-9 chargers Or some clapped out catfish Camaros
As a chemistry student, I'll say that the spark isn't a catalyst, but the activation energy.
*DOWN TO THE WHHYY-ERRR*
Great episode!
More of these!
couldn't he have looked at the tach for bounce/no bounce? No bounce, means crank position sensor?
You missed a great ad opportunity with a scan tool company like one of those ones where you use your cell phone and you could made that an option for him to scan to find out the crank code
First thing for fuel would have been simply turning the key and listening for the pump to prime. Disconnecting the fuel rail wasted time.
Man I'd love to sign up for that. I've never found something I can't fix.
my bmw 740i
More like "Giving PERSON a car..."
This is what youtube was built for
I could fix these easly but i live i guess like 9000km away lol
Donut media isnt packin Youtube Premium? Lmfao
Brand new !!2004!!! 😂😂💀
You guys are awesome!!!
*Plot twist. This was an audition and he knocked it out of the park*
Have had every one of these on my G35
Anyone else's 03 350z not have a clutch safety switch or just mine
If you chose me I would need google for literally an entire day and I'd still be with a car that doesn't start. I can hit the starter with a hammer AMA.
love this content hahaha
My brother needs to be on this show
I wish there is a motorcycle edition of this...bring it to the philippines guys😁😁
Hit me up next. LA COUNTY My camry just went out
First thing I would have asked for is a scan tool, you can check timing,fuel pressure, fault codes.  It would had that car figured out in 30 min
Before using google I would of looked for the Manual would of told you location of all fuse boxes
Why make a challenge to give away the answer that defeats the purpose makes it not entertaining anymore cause he got the car without earning it
I don't know how to fix car's. But truly in need of a newer car. I own a 1996 Subaru legacy! :)
👍👍🎁🎁
spark     fuel     air    compression
Ladies and gentlemen…we got em…a mechanic working on his own car
I am so glad this guy won the car and hopefully, he can work out the state and federal taxes...
If only it was ChrisFix haha, would’ve diagnosed and fixed it in seconds! 😄
also in c nets test howe comes the iPhone 14 pro has better benchmarks than 14 pro max
neshunda talking to herself because you said you were not excited
Why is there even a stopper over a clutch safety switch. This broke on my old WRX and I taped a penny over the hole until I got a replacement but it's a dumb failure point.
can i have that
Shit at this point in my life I'd take a free car my infiniti has almost 250,000 miles on it
Sign me up
i have to say working on your car can feel like the highest of mountains and lowest of valleys sometimes
I can fix it
My favorite car growing up. More affordable infinity G35 looking car.
2 hours isn't much to fix a car
Would _not_ use any aftermarket CKP sensor. Ask Ivan at PHD.  Good video !
This is such a brilliant show design! !
This is how i feel when i'm in the garage and my wife is pestering me every 10 minutes asking when i'm going to be done.
I would’ve literally cried. Gimme a dorito to be unable to fix as a non mechanic
I love this
Dang that car is gorgeous
They gave it away I'm a youtube mechanic on personal and parents cars and could have fixed it
If you guys gave me a free car that I had to fix I can guarantee it’ll be running within a month and I DONT HAVE ANY TYPE OF GARAGE I CAN TAKE IT TO FIX IT.
im neither a mechanic nor have i the a driving license but i helped my dad fixing cars, it would definitly end up as mine, with google of course xD
Can you do this for me with a 300zx
Great work dudes, happy i just found this channel
Man’s in blue messed up..
12:56 jajajaja his face says it all 😂
check if the immo key chip is not remove from the key
....air is always around. So basically all you really need is fuel or spark. you can unplug the MAF and it will still run. Interesting thing to do. Ya know is "up to speed" not around anymore? i liked that much better than anything.
I wanna be on this show... I'm a former mechanic.. Cnc machinist and programmer now... But I still got a couple foxbodys, and if you know foxbodys you're always upgrading and wrenching.. I think I could handle this show.
Bro if me and my dad could do this that would be awesome
nice nice show
compression - fuel - fire air is everywhere
That's nice of them to give away cars for their subs...🤙
I skipped to the end
Definitely should be a show on its own. I would watch every single time it came on. Win or lose
you should make a video where you find a couple or soemthing where there’s a mechanic and the other knows nothing about cars, and have the mechanic have to teach the other how to fix the car with tape on their mouth. so like he has to teach them with hand gestures and noises, idk just an idea
Did he leave with out his pregnant wife lol
So glad he drove away with the car. 😁
This would be simple for me..
2:30 it’s 10 minutes and 28 seconds 😂
I wish it was an old Honda Civic with a bad fuel main relay.  Just so I could smack the underside of the drivers dashboard and make the car start on camera.  Would be hilarious!
Cool video
what's funny is when I turned 16 my aunt gave me a 1997 Mitsubishi eclipse. it sat for 5 years before I even had got it. this video reminds me of the week I had trying to get it to start lmao doing the same things in a way.
This was cool af
You basically made sure they could keep weekly maintenance up on this car before you gave him it lmaoo these are mice cars I love them would def own one buttt not the most reliable
Choose me 😂
Definitely the first thing I would do before starting the clock would be to check the tools see where everything is if that would be a part of the rules or bring my truck close to the car cuz it has all the tools that I would need
Why didn't he ask to use a scan tool ?
heat🔥
I'm only mildly interested in cars and this has me fully hooked
Glad you guys didnt let it end like I thought it would.
Need to start learning more lmao
I know my myself and I kuldip have failed horribly 😅
Nicely done. Those were some tough fixes to figure out (except the air filter).
… drives off the lot w/o a license plate
Seems like a crank position sensor would throw an engine code if you put a OBD on it 🤷‍♂️
Did he leave his pregnant wife at the shop?
I would been won that !
Oh man, I'd be hilarious to watch not fix the car
Give me Honda S2000 to fix i got you
Man I would love the chance to do that I think I would surprise you guys
Much love and keep on the grind❤❤
Hey doughnut bro I love your constant and I would love to be on your channel to work on the car together it would make me super happy 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤❤
I know a guy works hard and can only drive scooter, he can't pass the license test for a car. Please help him get a moped 🤷🙏
Give me a Ferrari? Im becoming an overnight master mechanic graduate of YouTube .  Lol
Air......Fuel and Spark....I'll remember that for the rest of my life
If they didn't give him the answer he would've never got it started
it would have been even WORSE to have given him the part and let him fiddle than take time off right away, thats actually very nice and helpful lol
That's to easy bro. I don't know why you guys thing that this is some quiz...please shot me some real ( and possible to fix without specific tolls) challenge.
Is James turning into Richard Petty?
@7:05 it looks like he's talking to a partner/significant other.. but rolls out in the 350z solo.. I guess someone had to drive the car they came in?
air, fuel and spark.. he forgot compression..
Please do an if they can fix it on a Dodge Ram 1500!!
He should have gone on YouTube and watched this video.
You can't even see the crank position sensor on my G37, that's the only sensor on my car that worries me, it would be an ordeal.
He should of asked for the scan tool. He  could of pulled the live data up and seen what fuel pressure is, if it's firing, and if the crank sensor is functioning in 5 minutes.
why is it not green like in NFS U2
he couldnt use an obd scanner? crank sensor would throw engine light
this is so dope, if i could watch these all day
Vinn is secretly nolans brother dolan
Let's do my sw20!
this is the best gameshow i have ever watched ever, i tell you whut, when yall gonna do a netflix special, howie mandel just got a new gameshow and its bullshit. id watch this 7 days a week
Donut Media  I quit my job two months to open my own autobody shop I've always wanted to do videos but my boss was old and just didn't understand it and hates cell phone I've always wanted to make YouTube videos of the whole process and share to help others do autobody at home.  I did a little time lasp of me removing a bumper on a 2019 mustang so if you want go check it out and be one of my  first subscriber
i have this problem with my z rn cranking no start tmw ima try my crank and cam hoping it works
How come you never use the scan tool or did I I miss that
Me : Can I google for 5min?  James : yeah sure  Phone : "Hey Guys! ChrisFix here!"
this is what cars and friends are all about making fun memories along the way this was a great video
Wow
There’s a lot of informations in that video I’m Learning a lot from you guys and Vinh got a new car it’s win win keep up 🍩
I would love to see my dad do this he could do it easy
I'm afraid I wouldn't really know where to start. I've heard of these things, and no of their existence, but have virtually no experience. Working on cars other than my own routine maintenance and the occasional replacement of the obvious
I so want to do this challenge!!!
"This is kind of a tight space", as a motorcycle tech, I am envious.
Bro this would be a cool ass tv show concept
Import Direct Fuel Pump 🔥
I am crying jaja, happy he won that car
If these guys showed the process of getting a fan on video calling him and bringing him there all on camera and him actually being over joyed by a free car. But nope will take your word.. fake giveaways is common to get views. How about a single mother or father who actually needs a vehicle instead of keeping it in your circle...
This is vin... are friend who is getting a great car for content purposes free of charge
I wish a stranger would give me a car. Lol be truthful that was a friend or part of the act? Nothing is free. At least I never got anything for free in 40 yrs of life
Id love to know what a neutral safety switch is. I drive all sorts of cars for a job daily and have never come across one.
Great videos! You guys are great!
Wow! I just seen video I haven't seen nothing like this! Totally Awesome!
thats dope
Install a Q50s or a Q60s red sport engine into a QX70 or QX60 suv , what's your thoughts?
Where are you located at ?
Woah
I love these videos ..it helps others see what can go wrong and how to fix it
I’m jealous I wished I could fix a car and take it home instead work for one
Where did he go without license plates? 🤔
No offense but why do I feel like it's staged?
This is a damn cool idea! Love the concept of this show. Teaches folks some things about everyday cars n realistic probs that can and do affect a car. The other thing I really like is that it encourages folks to open their hood n fix something themselves.  You dont always need to go to a mechanic with a lil knowledge.  Not to mention sometimes in life you may not be able to afford a mechanic so you HAVE TO FIX IT YOURSELF! a show like this just might give some guy or gal out there the courage to tackle a problem themselves.  We all need more of that in today's world more than ever . Thanks guys! ......POP-UP UP N DOWN HEADLIGHTS!!!!!
I need a new episode like that 🔥🔥🔥
I wanna do this
I gave my Mercedes away to someone that will fix it. I didn't video my gift. I don't need to right it off
I wanna know if he traded 20 min for 10 min of Google if it would've wasted 20 or 30 minutes
Suck bang blow , that what a old many told me
I like how VINH says “there’s 3 components to a car start air, fuel and spark so the first thing I’ll check is the air filter just to make sure it ain’t clogged 🫤🫤😬😬🙄 not knowing the air filter was new and RAPPED up in plastic” I’m actually surprised he didn’t say well no wonder it wasn’t starting because it had no AIR. 🙀🙀🙀🙀🙀🤭🤭🤭🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I could use a van my handicap sister who has celbarpasy and is incompetent, I take care of full time she is wheelchair bound
I can work on only one type of car I know like the back of my hand and that’s the Chrysler crossfire srt6 or the regular Chrysler crossfire. I only need 1:30 minutes I can figure it out and get it running!
We need more of these shows on regular TV these are noiceee
Thanks, now I wonder why it takes 2 hours for an oil change at my dealership.
So epic 😄❤️
Did they just watch him crawl under the car and not put any jack stands 😂😂😂😂
I'm a Detroit backyard mechanic link me in please this looks fun
A clutch safety switch eh... you'd think they put a big sticker by it saying " this fucker won't let you start the car without it so make sure everythings there " I've had manual vehicles for 3 almost 4 years now and I've never heard of a clutch safety switch...given I've only had 2015+ manual vehicles so it shouldn't be missing parts
That’s a nice Z!
My dream car right there.
"He sus'd that out super quick"
Do a jeep next. Loving these videos guys great job.
Go Vihn! yeah!!!!!
Why couldn’t this have been me I need a free car I diagnose peoples car over the phone
Damn sign me up. I'll fix anything.
Wht
Only if i understood
Needs 4 things. Air, spark, fuel, COMPRESSION.
Please bring this back
A yugo or  Renault le car....lol
Do a yugo or lee car..lol
Mannn I wish I was on one of these episodes. Id love to test my knowledge to see if I could do something like that to win a dope ass car. The wrx one was fun  to watch I love Subarus and just got my first 04 wrx and watching that turbo swap was interesting. this Nissan one gave me a chance to gain some knowledge of that car. I love all your segments you guys do
That was fun.  Good job.
I would love to try this! Love the channel but I don’t know anything about cars. I would need much more time lol
People?
Fixing cars isn't hard, it's just painful and uncomfortable.
Nice script
I'd really like to do this
not subscribimg YET untill i know enough about cars to fix them when i do ill try my beest to end up on a episode to win a car
Man the things id do to meet you guys 🙄🙄
Good work Vinnie,and the troop was rightous!
The greatest repair of all time.
Why does this never happen to me Edit: Aw no I'm not thaat good
Call me when you guys get a Nissan skyline
Your brand new 2004 bro
Glad they threw him a bone since he clearly had the right point of failure diagnosed he just wasn't able to tell it was faulty.
Seriously so glad I came across this channel
Best show on YouTube
very well deserved
ME NEXT!!!🙋‍♂😄
Guy was just genuinely unfamiliar with the car, he woulda had that shit with no help just double the time
That was awesome🤗
This was very cool!!!
Favorite video theme of all times 💪🏽
IVE BEEN SUBSCRIBED!!! LOL!!
It's kinda screwed up they took parts out. When diagnosing a car that looks fully intact, I never think, I wonder if there is even a fuel pump? A computer theft yes, but missing parts that are cheap, no.. Lol
I have a 2008 350z that won’t always turn on , on the first try and it sounds like that z before he fixed the crankshaft sensor could that be my problem to ? Any help would be appreciated
I need a car 🚗
Bro is so lucky he got my exact dream car 2004 black nissan 350z manual coupe
I do own that car for ten years and it's a wonderful car i only sell it because i got a more wonderfull little girl and no space to park it, but I'm really thinking about brought another one.
Binge watching this series and banking on being the first female to attempt (probably fail) this challenge 😬
This was brilliant
He deserved it he’s very knowledgeable
Great video!
Chrisfix: allow me to introduce myself
👍👍👍🐐
If they finish with time left y’all should let them pick a few new parts for the car too
Must be nice 👍
I'm so glad Vinh won that car he came across as such a solid dude! Love you guys for giving him lifelines when he needed it while still staying true to the spirit of the challenge y'all are sweet hearts <3
something old skool with a carburettor and a mechanical fuel pump and drum brakes and a cassette player!
This is like Technical Control course in the Marines.  It's a very technical MOS with a high failure rate where you have to learn how to use a lot of different telecomm equipment to build out a comprehensive communications network incorporating several different comm. MOS'es, and in order to pass the course at the end 3 major communications sites are integrated and you are given a total of 140 minutes to troubleshoot 13 different problems (each problem is a separate instance where you are told the symptom(s) and from there you have to identify and correct the problem).  Very high failure rate but a very high bonus if you can pass it.
I had a strong suspicion that the crank sensor was bad, but honestly the rest would’ve gotten the best of me. I would’ve never checked the air box in a million years
well i cant subscrbe until i learn how to fi it then
My boi don't need a scanner, he is the scanner
It's funny to me how big of a channel donut media is that they don't even pay for youtube premium lol live and die by the ads baby
Cool series, you guys should do some kind of lightning round for maybe aftermarket parts for their new used car using the extra time they have. Maybe let them pick from mods and if they can get it installed before the clock ends they can have it. Installing an exhaust in a half hour?
I’m so glad this mf won this car! 😭
Boys I think you have created a new game show I liked it.
Why isn't a scanner allowed?  With computer controlled cars you need one
Earned my sub, this is how you do things when you become successful.
I learn more how to fix car from this video than hundred times fixing my car to mechanics.
If they put me on here I wouldn’t know what to do lol I don’t even know how to fix my 1995 GMC Sierra
This was an awesome video truly. Please make one with an old school alpha Romeo or classic car
Wish I could win.  A car
you brought this issue to some shady workshop they will comeback with 10 issues and 6K quotes including ecu problem. lol
Y'all some cracks 😂
Nissan are known for their oxygent sensor or fuel pump.
cheaky fake crank position sensor in absence of diagnostic tool!  Vinh done really well! Wow!
this is a great concept!  love it.  this guy was on point w his troubleshooting.  does he get to be in future videos w the gang meow?  lol
K.I.S.S.- keep it simple stupid.
I love this channel, I wish I would found it sooner. So entertaining!!
your BRAND NEW ''2004'' car!!!! xd laughed a little
please come africa
This series stresses me out way too much to watch.
This is basically just how to get your car fixed for free
1:20 it's over
Electric stuff sucks on Nissan. I would have started with the fuse box then the crankshaft sensors because they are notorious for going bad. Everything that goes bad with my infiniti was electric. Motor can run with no oil at all but will stall if a sensor goes bad. What im having trouble now is the fuel sending unit and the window motor.
takes 5 things to run. air, fuel, spark, compression, and timing.
Vin us a cool name. I had a friend in high-school named Vincente. Good times.
Just bought a 350z and it's always been my dream car. Watching this to see what symptoms of different problems are 😂
i can fix a subaru - guaranteed!
Oh yeah, Vietnamese's people are way so smart
Why yah can’t do this shit in my city LML
well i learned something new today. How combustion works and how it makes the pistons move
That loud hailer needs MOAR feedbacks.
"You can use google for 10 minutes" Pulls out phone "Hey guys its chris fix here"
I could use a vehicle since mine got stolen. 🙃 I just subscribed!
Where's my shot? I don't need a phone and I'll meet you anywhere.
I can relate to this! I spent an eternity trying to figure a no start on my 96 TT Stealth. Thankfully I have a 93 TT Stealth as well, so instead of going to the parts store ii stole frome it.   Thiugh I didn't want to I decided to pull everything thing off and compression check the back 3 cylinders. Not sure how as it has been years since replacing, but 2 of the plugs were darn near hand tight! Got new plugs, put back together and vroom!
badass , learned a lot
Look like Q brother
If I were to take my car to a mechanic, it would have taken them a week just to tell me what was wrong with the car and another week to fix everything and half of what they fixed didn't even need to be fixed.
Sell me the black z bumper on the wall
giving away my dream car on my birthday mane ts breaks my heart
12:58 dude you gotta see that hint😂😂
Awesome concept. Love it. Subscribed.
Jerry has to stop fucking explains fuel spark and air dude we get it Stfu about it
Hell ya first gen Gs are the best! Just get the newer engine tho lol
How bo BGVRP please for pc ok bro good bye bro
First time viewer and just subbed! Fun video for this non-car guy
If I did this I would win this
lame.   if it was an actual broken car I would be more inclined to watch, but not sabotage as a prank\joke.  that's not real world difficulty... more like Fake news Media.
I know nothing about fixing cars try me with a lex
How did they 'sabotage' both the fuel pump and the CPS at once 🤔?
❤️
Dang right he's not related to Mr.Diesel...  Man can fix a car in a fraction of the time by the sound of it.  2 hours, and at least 1 of those hours was overlooking something because he couldn't use the codes being spat out by the car to tell him what was wrong.  He's on another level.
cool
Matt Matteson??
This is a great series to learn how to diagnose problems
Definitely my favorite series even if I'm not the one walking away with the car.
I wish someone offered me a free car if I could fix it I would fix it lower it it would be so nice
Love ya too..
I even recall when you broke down on the road ,it was the crank sensor, …
anyway being bedbound since nov2018 I’d love the chance to get dirty again..I used to teach at UTI as well after I was crippled on Xmas eve 2005. At 8:30am..I’m USARMY 11HOTEL..MY MOS..anyway I’d like to bring my son to help to reach areas I can’t not fr9m my wheelchair..love your channel..I know there’s a small chance your even read this but one can only hope..:)..thks
Why didn’t he just Google how to dia the crank sensor , and there’s only two options a crank or and a cam sensor..one makes it’s own power, the 3 wire uses 12volts..he would of been done in 4 mins..he just had to ask for a crank sensor and see if that was it, lol…
I’m a disabled vet, crippled I’d like a chance to fix a car…need one for my sons first car..pls..thks
The guy is a good mechanic
Great series, I wish someone would do this for me, my mom needs a car, and neither me or her can afford it
Your graphics and sound design team are amazing, as you probably already know.
I'm stressed for this man
The fuel air and spark was clever to mention
Knowledge is the key to success congrats brother
Srt4 next
I can get it running
im a legit good mechanic but i honstly might of missed the clutch safety switch.  Ive been working on auto's for too long.   Good catch bro!
I'm so happy for that dude. Damn
Well I don’t really know how to work on my car i know a lil here & there not a lot I’ll hate for it to be a new car I know how to fix Carbureted like a Grand national regal or a 442 Oldsmobile
Lovely car and I'm glad the hint helped him because it would've sucked if he lost because he's unfamiliar with the cars layout and design
Invite Scotty Kilmer 😂😂
Why wouldn’t the first thing you do is hook up a scan tool and tell you pretty much what’s wrong with it
For the clutch switch, If he would have asked for a welder and a penny would you have deducted time?
Maaan I was hoping he did it! I was rooting for him like I knew him.
"3 minutes of Google remaining..."  **immediately starts a 7 second countdown**
Do an Oldsmobile aurora or a cutlass.
This is a great idea!
He's missing the other 2; timing and compression.
Dopee!!!! I wouldn't know shit lol
He should have asked for the manual for that fuel pump
Thought he asked for a fleshlight at the beginning . Thought it was a little early for that lol
I like this show
Send me cars ! I fix and flip like no other 🤠
instead of working for years to get a car just get to a dunut media video to get a car in less then 2 hours
Did he drive out and leave his girl there 🤣
why tf didnt this man use a code reader
That look Jobe gave Vinh after he mentioned the code is the funniest god damn thing on this channel.
well done, he deserved it.
Vinh was made for the camera, solid dude.
Put me in next coach!
my father could do this no doubt
should have made him do donuts for the remainder 17 minutes in order to ensure he properly fixed it
This is my dream car, it ain't no ferrari or lamborghini. Too luxurious for me. Too broke own a supercar.
Chris fix walking by: hold my beer
Donut, well done!
That's sweet
Super happy for this guy..and super cool prize 🏆 LOVE IT !!! 🤡❤️💯
Why not use a scanner and get the codes?
Next need ChrisFix,thats be intresting
Legend has it…he broke down a mile within leaving the shop
How do you feel about your brand new 03 nissan 350z? I don't want it. Too many problems I had to replace. 😦🤦‍♂️
Bad night 65
This is such a cool Idea! Best game show ever!
We weren't able to add your reply. Please try again.
Man, I wish I knew even a tenth of what these guys know about fixing cars!
This was such a cool vid. Thanks guys
This was awesome!!!!
I will learn from this channel for future purposes. Currently, I just a mere Bike Mechanic so hehehe Cars would be a step up.
How much was that freakin z I want it rn
That’s how fucking brand bro 😎
2004 😂🤭
Best series in my opinion 👌
Really cool episode
If I was subscriber when was ask to go in I bring a mechanic with me lol
Him trouble shooting and swapping the parts all on 2hrs is quite impressive gg bud
When I was in school our auto shop teacher had a car in the shop that didn't run and said anyone who could get it running before the end of the year could skip the rest of the year and he would give them an A and perfect attendance record. Nobody ever figured it out, then at the end of the year he showed us: He had put a small piece of paper around one of the contacts of the starter fuse... many minds were blown that day.
I would have cried if he didn’t win this car! He deserves it.
It's more like Air, Fuel, Spark, and Computer with newer vehicles.
Best way to win a car, earn it! Loved this
This is a really awesome way to win a car, dude literally worked for it lol thats so awesome!
Definitely subscribed. Love this.
Bro i need a car so bad omg
Down! Hope to see you guys one day!
Bring it over I'm in
They were mad he won the car..you guys are hilarious..I love your vids..
They probably secretly put Adblock on at 12:43 but are pretending they didn’t so people won’t be encouraged to block ads on this channel
Me pick me
I'd still be there for 3 more days.
I would love to be picked to come work on a car. I was raised in a garage my whole life. My dad was  a street mechanic. Both of my dads brothers was machanics thier dad was a mechanic. I love working on cars
Glad you guys helped him in the end. Good video  NEXT - try a Bentley  - costly but an older one is cheap
There should be a show like this on cable. With teams and all.😎 I hope to see more of this.  Maybe make a channel just for this.  it would be a hit.  I'm subscribing.😀
What did you expect? He's Asian.😎😁
Wow
finally he get it!!! nice!! this way i would holding a nissan 350 Z too. ;-)
Can he use a obd
Just Subscribed ! Do a 2009 Toyota Tacoma! :D
Congrats Vin
Easy 5 minutes diagnostic is spray carb cleaner (it works the same as starting fluid) into the intake tube.  If it starts it’s probably spark if it doesn’t it’s probably fuel.
putting myself in his shoes...i would have gone home without the car. lol....
Loved seeing him work through it. Great video guys! Glad yall gave him the resources and hints to win. Donut wins!
Vinh, He is Vietnamese?
Can i try?😭
Cool idea. As a tech myself I was shouting out what to check lol. He did a really good job. Trick I used to do when training new techs at my shop was to put clear tape around the posts/terminals on the battery and put the cables on. Couldn't see the tape and if you went to check batt. voltage on the post it would be good. Had to check on the post and the cable end. Another  was reverse the hoses at the fuel pump or put the fuel filter(if it had an inline) in backwards. Edit: checking that safety switch first thing was epic though.
More Vinh in the future?
I could of won this car and I’m a backyard mechanic lol so said even with out the clues
Compression
Sick lol I wanna play🤣 my new favorite game show
That's dirty! Didn't even let him watch some ChrisFix??! :D
He shouldve played the game and not just tried to fix the car. lol.The goal is to get the car to start, right?  Dont waste time replacing the  clutch sensor, tape that bitch. You can eliminate problems strategically by asking for parts, seeing if you get a time loss, and moving on (I actually didnt understand why he still replaced the fuel pump after he lost time for choosing the wrong part) then you can save time right? Also, they probably would've gone for sabotaging easy to access things.. lol. Idk.. i could just tell, like they said, that he was approaching this from a real world mechanic perspective, and he shouldve looked at the game for what it was and played the game. lol
woah he took the car without license plate i hope he doesnt get pull over with the excuse i just got this car lmao
i wish you could fix my jetta lol
That's freakin awesome, 😁✌️🤘
It’s actually hilarious they messed with the crank sensor. Cam and crank sensors put vq’s in “for sale” mode
That's an awesome series. Its astonishing to see how fast people can diagnose an issue. And yet our mechanics take couple of days xD
I thought they meant to give it to a poor person
how has nobody noticed the Byzanz e36
I learned so much watching this video
This should be on netflix! <3
watching his facial expression at the end was priceless. good job guys very nice of u to let him watch the video for the clue.
I would try that any day
Hire this man
You guys got 666 million followers... 777 will come back
It's Fuel, Spark, and Compression. No Compression, no run.
This was sweet 🙂
Follow the 10 commandments Christians and ask for forgiveness so you go to heaven and repent from your sins
Lmao I knew it was a crank position sensor as soon as I saw they were trying to get a 350z to start
You know, I’ll say this: I don’t think this was exactly handed away for free! He blasted through so much maintenance work. I heard 2 hours and was straight up discouraged! Good on him!
Great job 👍
Love my 03
Cam sensor
That car looks better than high car and low car combined 🤣
Any mechanic would be able to do this quickly with a diagnosis tool. Just put it in and then boom, you got the issue right on the screen. Btw do the WRX STI next. This might be something i could get my auto tech teacher to do. This might be a good challenge for him since he only knows old cars and early 2000's cars
please make video how did you break the car
Idk but all of that took him way to long i woulda had it started in 7 mins by bypassing all your tricks
Idk but all of that took him way to long i woulda had it started in 7 mins by bypassing all your tricks
Ahaha this is a bad {APPLE} idea!  Gotta love this test from the teacher…. Learn and earn 🧠💰  “Don’t stop get it get it “
Fantastic new series idea, but I can't put myself in their position, I would be mortified and starstruck and I know I'd fail, my mechanic pace is very hobby and casual, I mean it's a hobby after all and mostly zen while listening to music or an audiobook. This was scary and I sweating for this guy. He also killed it, I'd have failed super hard and I know this stuff.
Pull out the scanner asap ,check all ground ,battery and gas
What a genius lol
I would love an opportunity like this i love cars and this would make my life but im not that lucky☹️
What if he did everything right and it still didn’t start? And everyone’s like wait whaaat? Lol
It's actually 10min and 28 sec
"brand new" "2004"  :) "barely driven" "200 000 miles" :D
you should work on my BMW M3
Just because a sensor looks good doesn't mean it is
🏁🏁🏁🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🍻🍻🍻🍻🍻🍻
my g35 is cooler
e vala  nebi ga upalio da sam  ga ja sabotirao na  najlaksi nacin  bez ikakvog  menjanja dela
What an awesome channel and awesome series. Love you guys
I love everything you guys do and yes you guys have saved my life lol
wrong.. A gasoline engine needs 3 things Fuel, Spark COMPRESSION. thank youfor coming to my ted talk
Pick me
The title reminds me of when a buddy said if I can fix his bronco 2 I can have it for 100  Needless to say it was just a ground wire lose 🤣 only kept it a few months put new tires on it an sold it back to him for 200 😉
if i had time remaining i would of repaired the wheels or sound system.
I think i found a way to hire free mechanics.
I was postive on the switch and the crank position sensor is a common failure on many cars. I would eventually also diagnose the fuel pump cuzz I had a pump problem on one of my previous cars, clearly was not operating when turning the ignition on. This guy is good :-)
This was a great idea, i just had a "total loss" i bet you got more money than i got my settlement. 😉
I would have known instantly since I owned a Z and had my clutch safety switch go bad. And hearing no crank but battery working....first thing im checking.
so happy for him
Best way is fuel spark and compression.
Taping the filter was dirty as fuck.
Really genuine guy, glad he won, well deserved.
Wow, straight to the fucking point and entertaining as well as an informativr ass intro, subbin
Come to me with any one and bet I can get it to run
This is a fun game, whoever thought this up should get a raise for this. Also you guys are doing a great job with this channel. Lots to enjoy and learn, and watch you guys suffer trying to fix stuff too lol. Good job everyone.
Now i see where all the donut stuff is coming from. My guy got thicc
A guy needs service info to fix something. It can be so frustrating to guess!
That was so cool!! Very informative. I would have gotten the fuel pump and intake sabotage without a doubt, but I definitely would not have gotten the other two.  I would have cried if i would have won for sure lol
awesome show guys  now a subscriber
Hell I'll go for a 2000 Honda Civic with a flat tire, disconnected battery and no gas..
I like this idea. Helping me learn and also  great content. 👍  subscribed
This is really a good idea I'd love to watch more
I want to participate
give me one i will fix it lol
how did you get it there?
8th gen si
He repimped his ride up real good 🫡
My dream truck is a 86 Toyota Truck.
You should change crank shaft at the same time you change the cam shaft ps just in case because they failure are very similar and you could also get a defective brand new one
Takes 5 things for a engine to run, fuel, air, spark along with timing and compression..
Sorry for the language.. BUT..I FUCKING LOVED 😍 IT .. SHOULD BE ON TV..NO BUT I DON'T WATCH TV ..SO I'M HOOKED
Obviously he was supposed to spin em in the shop immediately after start up.... That's a missed opp.
Any recommendations for where to get parts? I have a 09 Mazda 6 V6 3.7 Liter engine, I need some struts, I put cheap quick struts and now the car sits too low which is bad news for the streets of NYC. I also need a wheel speed sensor. *sigh* this car needs work but it’s my baby! 🥹
Do a old school BMW
Find me a non running late 80s to mid 90s acura or honda I'll get it running and I'm not even a mechanic!
i would absolutely destroy this game
I’ll take a non running car and definitely will get it running
Give me one!
Give this man a job hes likeable knows his shit and really made this episode all the more better
I honestly wish I knew a lot about cars just so I could go up in there to fix up a free car, but I'm studying to go to medical school instead....
I love your channel, great content! I am clueless mechanically wise, but I am just learning so much just by watching your videos!
This episode was so much interesting and learning at the same time.
1:22 that made me laugh
Bro how do I get on this show?
Buy my gto it’s been painted 3 times and still still shit and falling off the car none of them taking blame iv lost thousands
its actually better to just give him the wrong parts, too. he will spend too much time repairing a fully functional component anyways  and we will enjoy is suffering, too! :P
Would have been great if it was ChrisFix “Hey guys!” On that show lol more publicity 😏👌
Let me have it
I told that to my neighbor the second time I drove my Tesla through his house... It didn't work though. The car burst into flames, set the house on fire, and killed everyone inside. Now I'm lonely.
Such a good video so much suspense
I wanna win a car!!!!
good and generous ! Great video mates
Can I pls play to win a Honda si that’s my dream car no matter if it has 300000 miles in it
My name is Chris and my dream car is a Honda si
Should be Air Fuel Spark Timing…
Does this guy have a tango blast tattoo?
My Honda civic been dead forever gonna look through out all the process now in that rotation!
I'd smash that show like 15minutes, give me something hard like "rebuild this eldelbrock carberator....  Next car should be a bike.... Lol
buy me a car and ill take to the shop to fix it in 2 hours
I love these guys!
Me: Put me on to try to win your next car!  Them: It'll be something European. Me: I'll see myself to the exit now.
Man I whish I had the opportunity to win my dream car
What the hell 🍩 this is why I love y'all.
I accidentally bent the bracket on my crank sensor tightening a manual belt tensioner on my car. Rough and hard starts until I found the issue. Just a very slight shift too.
I would absolutely accept your challenge...
Mustang
He deserve it🦾
You guys gotta do a car without a computer!
Its my dream car
Give that man a job at Donut!
Wow, speechless, happy for him, newcar!
He did this in less than 2 hours, but your local mechanic just charged you for a 4 day engine rebuild.
Did he just drive away without a plate
This video saved me a tow/mechanic bill! I had replaced my alternator and sabotaged myself unplugging the crank position sensor lmao
You guys are the best!!! You guys wanted him to drive away with the Z. 😆👍
Megaphone was the best part! Awesome series!!. I enjoy participating in something like this✊🏾
BRO GIVE IT TO MEEE
I would love to win your next bmgive away but I'm mostly sure with my luck it won't happen  lol
He sus-ed out that clutch safety switch faster than I find my phone in the morning.
I've been watching this channel for years now, and can definitely say this is the coolest series you guys run. I hope to see many many more of these. Probably won't be a ton of them, since obviously giving away cars is expensive but damn it's really good. Also science Garage. Do more science garage. Please.
MEE3EWE
me
me

man that guy is annoying
Donut or not this episode is really something and their generosity towards Vinh sure is encouraging and inspiring from the Donut Bois. Captivating!!! Congrats to Donut and Vinh on this successful episode!
Man I'm a mechanic love to have chance to show my skills
homie is definitely a jdm guy wasnt even worried about fixing it fully as long as he got it to work
My dream car!
Is that matty mathison
if we dont include the 15 mins he wasted on google, he fixed the car in 1 hour and 28 minutes. It takes me longer to do a oil change when not using a lift.
He left his wife behind? lol
good stuff!
I would have lost lmfao
bro this is why i love donut media
I'm sorry but Nissan is a huge heap of trash.
Actually a Nissan should start with a  disconnected crank sensor. It would hard start but it would start
The more I watch the mechanics fix cars on donut media (especially on a timer) i get more fired up to fix my 97 pathfinder . Thanks donut for the awesome series!
Totally deserved win. He knew his stuff and was just under lot of pressure...
This was my first time watching your video I liked it I will be back 💯👏👏👏
18, no money, no more gas cars in 2030 law, busy with school and strict car rules. I'll never drive my dream car in this lifetime.
Toyota crown
Anything helps
0:31 r/Unexpected Bojack Horseman
i would’ve asked for a obd 2 code reader 🥷🏿🥷🏿🥷🏿
I'm cry we have a g35 sitting in are front yard covered up because my brother sold it, the person that got it just need the front and back bumper so they gave back after so know it sit with no bumper's look like a dumpster car, but happy to say i talk to my dad about mod it or something give the love and attention it need bad and he said he well, because it a nice car and nothing wrong just the miss pieces <3😂
he looks like hao from gta v but older
This was good
.
I'd be happy to take this challenge.
2:29.  It was 10 minutes not 11 😂
I recently bought a my first car, very well kept BMW e60 2005, earlier i was afraid of problems. But channels like this actually is very informative and i learn a lot from it. I am thankful for this kind of content! Keep it going!!!
Anything is possible with luck and YouTube.
I wish I could’ve done this exactly what I had to go through with mine
1987 Grand National 3.8L V6 Turbo. :)
he looks like benny from gta
Toyota Cellica 2000 1.8L 140bhp
What software do you guys use to make these animations, these are amazing
isnt this the same guy that got the old acura?..
it would be funny if u brought dads who think they can fix a car and test them
more vids like this!!!
that’s so dope
This is great. Absolutely love this
Oh please oh please let me come do one of these. I’m not the craziest mechanic, but in decently inclined. Longtime subscriber, and if I had a shot at a 350z, I would be beyond thrilled. Love the series and love what this channel is about!
https://youtube.com/shorts/_61suJqHpfg?feature=share
Easy diagnosis for anyone else in future, if you don't have RPM on the tach whilst cranking, it's likely a bad trigger sensor lol.
Thank you for the knowledge I’ll watch your videos from now on (just discovered )
Why can he fix a car in 2 hours, but my mechanic does it in 2 weeks?
I’m confident I would’ve got the rest of them, but I would’ve never got that clutch safety switc
Vinh needs to be a regular
Very very nice segment! Moorreee 😁👍
Wow, Awesome Video❗👍🏾
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6vhGHxWb8A
Do an old S chassis
This is the best thing on YouTube!!!
Let them fix a 1964 Fiat.
lmao imagine if the winner got the job in that service shop too xD like getting free car and a job lmao BRAND NEW 2004 NISSAN XDDD that made me laugh so much
Shoutout to Google for once again not giving us the answers we look for, but instead a bunch of random useless bullshit. #googleisuseless
i love this editing
Not a mechanic but positive I can do this in 1 hours
Can Vinh become a regular? I really like this dude
I love the concept idea of this video and although it might end up being quite expensive for you guys unless you want to make it harder to fix and or don't be so helpful. Would love to see more, you could even use older less valuable cars.
next time give em a go pro so we can see under the car ;)
The puzzling kite internally pretend because seal genetically bolt within a flawless pakistan. smart, orange record
A Toyota
It’s not fair because they gonna bring a car to person like me lol..   insta finished
Did he forget his pregnant wife when he left 😂
Nice job dude. very calm under pressure and great thought process.
I have a1989mazdab2200 series do u think u could help me find ignition condenser resistor I'm not a mechanic LOL I just want to get my truck running and my clutch destroyed too exhaust is comes into the cab I want to do the work myself don't have the money to pay for all if the parts are theysomebody to work me over on price I don't have the money I wanted you to love myself money
Man, why stuff like this don’t ever happen to me?
12:52 caught me tf off guard lmao  Side note still don’t know what he said
Never knew I wanted to be a car guy until I bought an old Datsun, I love that thing but I have no clue how to fix it. This is actually helping me.
Loll
“We’re all friends now and your friends came in clutch…” that they did
You technically need air, fuel, spark, and compression. Air and intake will not ignite unless it is compressed. If you really want to fuck with him cut the power wire to the crank or cam sensor in a spot that isn’t easy to see. He will shoot himself and the car before he could figure it out. Electrical issues are the worst.
crashed my fully built car today, what car should i get next
Bro was on that clutch safety switch like a fly on sh!t. He definitely dealt with some sh!t before.   Most pre mid 00’s cars other than BMW’s didn’t have the clutch safety switch thing…  Which made bump starting easier if you had a flat battery.
Every time he goes under there with the jack and I see no jack stands I get very anxious.
Man. Tlo jphis is the greatest company ever!  HonestlyI feel like this community is so solid. It's community is dope. I hope one day I can break bread with the crew. Just a meal and talk cars and life.
350z is my dream car and i couldve probably fixed it who knows
I say I take it to a shop 1st? Lol
Me next! Beat new show. Damn I need a donut now
Crank angle sensor relearn necessary.   Give that man a scan tool
First time viewer. You guys rock!
It's AIR fuel spark and most importantly compression...
The O'Rielly Import Direct pump will last maybe a few months and not read fuel level correctly.  lol Same with the crank sensor.  Aftermarket stuff is pure garbage.
That was sweet.Wish they had a car that can fit me my wife and 8 kids lol
بدها ميكانيكي اردني
https://youtu.be/l-4_OK4Zx8c
Here is what an engine actually needs to run: Air, Fuel, Spark, COMPRESION, TIMING.
Bruh I know someone literally selling the same thing it’s gorgeous but doesn’t run that’d be cool to do at pt 2
Awesome job
When you are chasing a fault you should always start at the load where possible. No point trying to find/test a fuse and a relay when you can verify both are fine but just checking power/ground at the load. In this case checking power/ground at the fuel pump would confirm that both the relay and fuse are good and the pump is bad.
I like the dedication Mr. Vinh had cause it's final paid him off, he kneed what was the problem but only some self-esteem that nearly drailed him....
Congrats
I love this! What a way to teach some standard citizens how to do some things! I feel like this channel is a great idea! Bet it does America some good!
I NEED a car!
Awesome, I would have been lost with the crank position sensor lol
Bro thank u for doing this bc tbh I’m actually learning something and you guy make it fun to learn things
I bet theres a ton of people out there that wish they could have had this opportunity. Damn including myself haha
He forgot his wife, what a guy! :D
1.000.000 miles is 1.600.000 km O.o In EU you can get a new one at 1.000.000 KM hahah he got scammed. Volvo. BMW. Mercedes. Volkswagen ALL do 1.000.000 KM change. It's even on their website.
Wow bruh my dreams car
If i got problems i deliver my car to this man
I wish something like this would happen to me. But, I live where a manual is not ideal and whatnot.
The next car you should do, ... ... Is, ... My Car. I know very limited stuff about fixxing cars. But, i bet i could figure it out!!!  #PICKME2WIN/TRYTOWIN A 🚗
Jschlatttt been eating good
22b plz and choose me hehehe
Why they have like 10 dudes just watching the guy, go away watch in some other room and let’s the man work with maybe like 2 dudes just there in case he needs anything
Imagine he blows up
Idk man these guys must be exceptional mechanics it took me over 2 hrs to change the crankshaft sensor on my old dodge these guys bang out a years worth of maintenance in under 2 hrs
My dad would of fixed it in a heartbeat.
You can give me a broken car, a few of them.
This was great.!!! Good warch.!!
what an   awesome idea!
i would love to do a sports car 😩
Bruh to be sitting down in a chair watching a hi/lo episode with Nolan, James, Zach, and Jeremiah behind as subscriber would be a dream come true; Well second to them helping you build a car; i would legit couldn’t think; that’s a lot of knowledge in that room
1:32 Man I just read how mechanic shop let an employee with no DL get in the truck and took it off its e brake and killed his co worker not knowing it was a manual😳😟and get this the owner of the truck is being sued. Not the company
I would like to do a Volkswagen bus challenge.
“Oh man an ad! Skip, skip, skip”  Even the professional YouTubers don’t have YouTube premium 😂😂
Donut Media! Put me in the game coach!
I volunteer as tribute.
I would have freaked out for this car .. DANG this is nice
Awesome
I think its more expensive to fix the damn car that buying one that work
I have a Mercedes Benz S class model 2009 dosent work
Literally my dream car
Awsome🇳🇴😎
I need to become a mechanic just so I can win a car 😭😭
smell the tailpipe for fuel!!!
NICE !!!!!
F150 specifically any OBS version with a manual transmission should be next up on the old operating table, to fix and keep.
All you need to do is hit it with a hammer a few times and swear and itl work fine,
🔧👀⛓
Maybe take out a plug and see if it has spark. If it doesn't it should smell like gas. If it doesn't than well you know.
wow not staged at all!
I work on airplanes and this show confirms cars are more complicated/crowded than a plane. I sometimes have friends ask, "do you know what's wrong with my car" or "can you fix my car?" Because I'm an aircraft mechanic and know everything about cars! Nope! I can figure it out, but It's not fun like planes are. I now need a timing belt on my VW Golf TDI & watched a video on the DIY, but It's so much detail work & takes so long it's almost worth $1,500 to just have it done.
Is that weed in the car? 7:00
Would love to see a Mini Cooper
Next time instead of a 2 hour time limit  you should lock them in the garage...alone...with food, water, and a toilet. No help, no clues...they can drive out or walk out. Victory or submission...THAT would be entertaining to watch!
Wow! American way of business ... you guys are so stingy. This is unfair lol
This is actually a really cool video concept 🙃👍
Nice
This man fixed a broken VQ in 2hrs. Why am I still waiting for my oil change ??
I wanna try to do this, but win the car for someone else. I love videos like this. Y’all are the best. Earned my respect and subscription for sure!
god that car is ugly no wonder you giving it away
this is an interesting concept for a video or even a TV series
Should’ve let him dump the clutch in the shop
I think this is my new favorite YouTube show
vin seems very good with the flashlight!
Great idea. only problem is that its staged. but a great way to learn about cars.
Video made me happy good job God Bless you all
This was amazing and pure entertainment! Thank you!
Workshops should use this concept as an job interwiew. You make the car run, you get the job!
A professional would plug it into a computer diagnostics.... this whole video is bullshit
Don't even know shit about cars but this is cool 👌🏼
Do a bad ass GTR THATS CHEAP BECAUSE THIER BADD ASS AND CHEAP NOW BASED OFF DEPRECIATION AND PICK ME AS THE NEXT CONTESTANT FOR THE  CAR AND OR FOR ANY CAR MAN MY BROTHER BOUGHT ME A BMWM3 AND TOLD ME 2 GRADUATE 1ST AND I COULD THEN HAVE IT BUT 1 SEMESTER BEFORE GRADUATION HIS BEST FRIEND STOLE AND totaled the car and sadly the car was not insured by my brother yeah it honestly broke my fing heart
I'm very glad he fixed it Vyhn
I love how not only is this entertaining but also very educational!
My turn!
Not fun fact : actually its his own car
This is easily one of the  most helpful DIY car videos on the internet
Porsche 911 carrera
I'd fly myself out to Cali to get this kind of opportunity.
15:02
id do anything for the 350z, or the 370z
Me next
Although im not a mechanic but i love cars , this video was super enjoying
Manual should have a tach, if tach doesn't show RPM when cracking - suspect CKP circuit - basic
Was waiting for the battery to be dead from all the cranking hahaha
One of my favorite cars
Loved this video contest
Definitely cringy, but it’s a way to learn I guess.
you guys wont do a 4th gen supra
Fix my car, chevy impala 09
10:50 in some cars fuel pump dont  need to have a sound before cranking tho
why would anyone play this and "win" a z.....seems evil lmfao . this video gives me flash backs to when i had a z that wouldn't start. fuel pump went shot, and overheated every time i would turn it on, smoke in the exhaust sometimesa driversd side window that would go up...... overall a pretty good car hahaha
New suber just saying hi  Nissan Altima GLE
His girl look good
This is a cool series
aas a trick they should just not put any fuel in the car
Matty Matterson from cooking to cars
My brother and dad would crush this challenge 😂😂 they’ll get it started for long enough to get it home and then work on it further at home
I want to see more episodes like this it was fun I didn’t think he would get there in the end hahah
Such a good idea for a video thank you guys Binging right now
his ability to be so chill is impressive
If you make it fair there is no Japanese car that I cant fix in 2 hours.
I think what got him was all the eyes on him its weird working when people are just looking at you
If this guys a mechanic I’m sure he could afford his own 350 regardless lol
When we doing me
Lol I’ve never rooted for someone so hard while watching!! Good video!
really good video. im glad for the guy
I wish 😂
Idk if it’s will he able to fix it does he have the equipment and parts is the other part
Now imagine. You have RB25DET. There is a spark, there is air and there is fuel. But it doesn't start. One wire cut. Which?
i'm a do it your self , and i knew all of these steps to take. cause i watch these kinda video and do the work myself ,thanks for all the info you guys post
p m I replaced my camshaft position sensor  ,before it went out
fuel pump caught on something , have the tank almost full it comes out easier
brand new ? 2004 350z?
Great idea . The comedy act and distracting him , and patronizing home was borderline ridiculous . The help thing should be built in so he earns the help by strategy. They were a bit all over the place with no structure
I bet alotta mechanics have made money over that neutral clutch button 🤣😂
https://youtube.com/shorts/VdAZS9TVle4?feature=share
they hurt him bad with no access to a scan tool or a power probe
That's one dude I would trust with my life to work on my car.
This show should be called “fixer keeper” because it matches what they’re doing and it’s catchy.
I actually thought that car was new, I'm dumb
the funny guy needs to lay off the tator chips
Would have been fun to do this challenge as I drove up in my G35. XD
It occured to me that I have no clue what a neutral safety switch is because my truck doesn't have one, i guess toyota just said "fuck it" and lets you start in gear with a 1st gen pickup
What a cool series
Here's a challenge. Get a z32 300zx and get someone to find out the problem in under two hours. Spoiler: it would be hard.
giving people a car, if they can steel it.
what car next? a car that is not a piece of shit like the 350z in the thumbnail, absolute disgusted to see a bunch of Milwaukee tools used on such a garbage dump of a car.....should be ashamed!
Give it to me
Just saying I wouldn’t mind being on one of these 😯
That’s what I needed when trying to start up my old 71 mustang 😅 a group of homies 🥺
Not only did he get a new car but he got brand new parts 😂 this man is winning at life
Looks like the brother of Martty Matheson
I fucking love this show I'm glad they came up with this
2 hours and parts, most mechanics would have charges 6 hours labor .
How do you guys pick who does this challenge?
i wish this was me
Amazing series  Love the hints  😂😂😂
I know what's wrong with it, it ain't got no gas in it
That was so cool of the crew..    Just imagine...😃👍
Great content! I learned a lot
If you guys do this with a Dodge Dakota R/T lemme know
Nice I really wanted him to win mechanics can have such a thankless job
Do Hi-low season 3
I don't think anyone commented this but you should definitely do a Mitsubishi 3000gt SL or VR4/Dodge Stealth R/T!
The man could buy a scanner.
chris fix makes fixes this easily
Man I would of had that car running within the first 30 minutes but that would make your video useless
Still my favorite YouTube Channel
I like this not diesel Vin guy he's definitely taking the the car home
What a joke... they can rig the car in any way they want, if they want a specific dude to have the car they make it so he can start it in an hour or so.
Bro he deserves that win 100% I would have either failed or just made it before the clock run out but only because I’m addicted to old turbo Japanese cars that don’t work....  🤦‍♂️🤷‍♂️😂😂
I want ChrisFix to crank that up !!!
I hope I can go on there n win a car
Lol this was awesome haha
The Donut guys telling people to skip ads on their video.  LOL
I had an older Nissan that had trouble starting.  Car had trouble starting but runs ok if I managed to get it running.  Trawling the internet, I narrowed it down to the immobilizer coil that was failing. The local Nissan guys couldn't fix it. Went to another mechanic that changed the immobilizer but put wrong spark plugs in causing misfires running on 3 cylinders & said  it was the ECU failing.   Almost had the ECU fixed when I got the car to an electrician & said it could be just wrong plugs. Sometimes it is not that easy especially on an older car.
Jesko
i don't think i would have been able to fix this car in 2 hours lol.  good show
Horrible video
Ready
The guy really didn't like when the man ♂️👞 used the n word. Even in a guy moment 😜
I’m glad I wasn’t part of this 😂 I would’ve been looking at the wrong things
I don't even know how to press a gas pedal upwardly or whatever, but if you offer me a car I'll fix it.
I would love to do this I could do this I’m no professional mechanic but I know  enough
To complicate it more, you need a minimum of 5 things to start a car. Air, Fuel and Spark... But you also need Compression and Timing. It's often forgotten about.
I'M SO FUCKING HAPPY FOR THIS MAN! CONGRATS MATE!!! Congrats ur new car!!!
This is cool, im learning and having fun at the same time
As I always say, you need 3 things for an engine to run: Air,Fuel, Spark, and a crank position sensor.
I wish I could do something like this 😔
3000 gt... i should be the contestant too.. i need a car for school since my 99 maxima front main seal went bad
Use r honestly hero's bro
Semi truck next.    I will get it running for ya
He deserves it 👌
12:58 zachs face says it all xD
The 350 fuel pump was literally my pet peeve fuck that part 🤣
You should have Chris fix on this.
I liked this
This is incredible. Why isn't it on Netflix?
Smart guy
Awesome content made my girl watch it with me and she knows nothing about cars great job
I don’t know Jack about Cars I would have guessed Alternator 😂
He quickly fixes the "no crank " issue like a boss! Next issue : "crank no start" short cut :prime the engine to immediately determine a : no spark " or "no fuel " problem. If she fires up on prime and dies ..you have just eliminated one entire system as a problem.  If not if no start with prime then its no spark so run with it .. jus saying..
Kompressor next?
finally donut media, we need this kind of content, educational and fun
Who else watching this to fix there car that won’t start ? 😭
you guys have to make this a TV show, for real it would be awesome
The only experience I have working on cars is throwing my problems into Google and bullshitting my way threw the repair.
I wonder if u can ask for the  scan tool?
I KNOW WHATS WRONG WITH IT. IT AINT GOT NO GAS IN IT!
Now throw someone an old Fiat Spider 124 with dual points distributor lol
Surprised the 1st thing he didn't do was pull codes with a OBD2 reader.
So....why do dealerships charge for many hours of labor? Lol
Out of air fuel spark, where does the car battery belong?
I’d like to work on an integra type R.. that be cool.
OMG PLEASE MORE OF THIS!! I LEARNED SOME STUFF LOL
tagging Chris Fix
The abundant magic alarmingly stuff because hand seemingly dress inside a milky store. elite, greedy shell
How the duck do you guys come up with these awesome ideas. 👌👌👌👌👍👍 loving it.
He got to many clues 🤷
That is a awesome channel you guys just made.
I dig the ideas, this episode is fresh
Fuck wish I had a car
BRAND NEW 2004 350Z 🔥👀
I’m actually pretty but hurt that they basically gave him the car. Buuuuut, he was an awesome mechanic! He woulda got it off the rip if he had a scan tool.
Lamborghini Aventador
This would be fun to do for sure! I'm glad I clicked on this recommended video defiantly worth subscribing!!
man these guys mad it too easy they should of gone to the pcm and depined the control wire for the injectors and put a defective relay for them as well along with a fuse for the coils then i would of losened up the pcm ground to the chassis and put a defective immobilizer or something so it wouldn't start.. i feel like this was a bit of a pre-planed video
I needed this lol...
I need a car guys. Can y’all help with that?
Easy way to check for crank signal is to watch the tach
Oh shit
i literally just subscribed to try to win a tuner car cause the prices are insane.. LOL  although i do have a question.. you guys provide the tools, do you have a Launch, or Maxisys scan tool? or is that forbidden?
Tesla
Kinda ironic how this is in my suggested while I’ve been looking for a Z for about a month…
If you fly me there im sure ill win, the only problem is that i cant drive cause im too young
Skyline when? Any from the R32  to R35. But my dream is R34. If possible :D
My bro got fat asf
I know you guys get a ton of comments but here's an idea for a new series. How about teaching young guys like myself (ok I'm 36 so maybe not that young), who love cars but have very little knowledge on how to actually fix cars themselves.   I would love to see this and learn from you.  Amazing content as always, gents!
Wonder if they're allowed to push start it
If there would've been a North Korean driver subscriber, he must've won that easily.   To get a Driver's Licence in North Korea, one need to disassemble, and assemble a car completely. Being a driver in NK is a highly reputed job.
You guys should come to lake  charles la
Awesome content. I learned something too
This reminds me of my practical exam to finish my apprenticeship except there was 5 cars and 1 engine rig on its own and about 2 hours to do it all 😂 and you don't win a car unfortunately. Awesome vid though yet again
Dude this would be the coolest thing ever to be a part of
Well deserved 🎉
bro my step dad would win a free car every time dudes a master mechanic
This video earned a sub. Hope to see more of these
Tssssss yoooo that a cleannn ass Z
I can make any engine run. Fact.
Well that was different and fun.
now do it with a person who knows nothing about cars to run through the troubleshooting, i would of def failed this challenge.
I swear every time He turned the flashlight on I was nervous 😭
i need car give me one :d
I love ur content bro keep it up god bless
👍❤🔥
Vin Petrol
Did it's..👍😂
To think like a technician. Not, like a mechanic.  A mechanic replaces parts A technician diagnoses and accurately replaces A part
do you guys have a new engine for my g35 in your trunk?
crank sensor on the bellhousing good one lol
im a subscriber put me on this shit nigga
Best series ever
My alarm went off when he said “start the clock”😂
while hes standing there thinking "should i use google?" worried that it will cost him extra time hes wasting time standing there that he could have given up to google.
Got a free feul pump too nice.
There are 3 things for an engine to run… air, fuel, electric power. Simple… right
I know it's easy to speak withouth pressure, But there should be voltage on the dc connections of the fuel pump when you start the car, so he could have measured it without asking for a part.
Happy to see someone drive off with something! Great job man
I spy a couple OneWheels 👀
its 10$k car at this moment
Air, fuel, fire and PRESSURE.
Whoa i like this video! I hope this type of video is going to be a episode!!!
Owning a 350z.. I'd already figure out what they did
So happy for this guy!
You guys are amazing 🥲
Choose me🙋🏻‍♂️🤣
I wish you would pick some less fortunate people that actually do have the skills and I think you should do a 65 Chevelle next or 67 and pick me please
come on guys make an episode with Chris fix
bring me pls
no
10/10 wholesome, MOH EPISODES BABEHHHHHHHHHHH
How did that dude work on a car for anything more than 5 minutes without getting his hands dirty?
Real cool
12:57 Oh my god that face, i died hahahahaha
I need a chance at this ASAP!
Hey donut media its nicholas you guys inspired me to work on a car and i was wondering if i can be on your next video i beg of you it's my dream seriously.
Isn’t the crank position sensor on VQ’s up top on the back of the motor, you know by the crankshaft? I had to change one the other day and I’m wondering how the hell he got it from underneath
U should set a new car up like a model t drives and see if somebody can figure out how to drive it
What was the target market for this? 13year olds?
Definitely a great video and would be a good show to watch on tv like a game show for mechanics. People would watch this and learn stuff even if they wasn’t mechanics then mechanics would watch to see if the person could get the car. I love this it’s a really good idea
3000GT or Dodge Stealth next!
PUT ME IN COACH
I need money my apartment blows my cash away lol
Man I wish the s2000s clutch safety switch was in a similar spot. We have to take the whole pedal out to fix ours.
Great source of knowledge for car enthusiasts!
Man this serie is puro fukin gold!
Give him 17 minutes worth of mods, like a double or nothing, but it must still start at the end.
ill tell ya what wrong wit it, aint got no gas in it
Awesome!
Holy shiii this was an amazing watch. Vinh's a legend
Grade A content! \m/
How can I try out to be a contestant?
im just like nolan; sometimes when i’m bored & working out i rewatch hi-low if nothing else catches my eye.
Dude i love this!🙌🙏👍
Only thing I would have done differently since I am a tech by trade is for the fuel pump; listen for the hum. If I don't hear it, grab a test light and start probing the connection at the pump. If it lights I know I have battery voltage to the pump and I can just swap it out.
the Ls Mechanic from gt5 would fix that in a matter of seconds
This video idea was amazing , congratulations on that new z 🔥
"FLIGHTLIGHT, ON IT!"
Awesome ending
This is a great series guys 🙏❤️
no scan tool allowed? this is as bad as the crap on TV..  go watch SCANNER DANNER if you want to learn something
tape on the filter is a stupid pitch. use real problems. take it to a so called real garage. wanna borrow my POS car? 1300 into it with the garage
scanner danner could fix it..  the garage  i took my car too is only good for oil changes.
amazing
Heeeell yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeea! love this ep
He earned that car
Please, I’m begging you, continue with this series. I’m a trainee mechanic and this is so helpful for me!
bro left with no plate 💀
See that ain’t fair mechanics do have wiring diagrams and everything like that on computers because each car is different so they may not know the layout of the car but they know what it takes to get it running
James is getting kinda old lol
Pull out the OBD and call it a day
I'd love to see a "can you get it to move" challenge. like taking an broken shitpile, and challenging people to get it moving however they can by bodging the crap out of it.
#SD s za %q
Coming from my +8 years of experience as a diagnostician, this a good thought process. He earned it!
I whana try this I bet it would be a awesome experience!
Air, fuel, spark and COMPRESSION are the FOUR things needed for an ICE to run. Most manufacturers designed the spark and fuel systems differently but COMPRESSION is will always have the same. Rings, valves and timing. Great show guys keep it up.
I have a feeling that Vinh is such an amazing, cool and humble person, he deserved this more than anyone else!
This video was absolutely God Tier,
Give a person a car, if they can fix it*
The production is sooo wholesome! People don't want fake drama. We want a nice close family atmosphere and hospitality like here - that is why the video got nearly 2 mil views ! The reason that negativity rules the news is not because negativity sells ... it doesn't sell as well as real positivity. The negativity in news is there cause some one paid for it to be there - cause it is a useful talking point at election time and programs people the rest of the non voting years.
Happy AF for this dude!! Awesome video idea.
he’s vietnamese what else can u expect
I wish I had this opportunity because I can fix anything. If I want to is another story 😂
Put me on the show to win a car, ill have it running it 30 mins
Nice
knee san
Bomb idea ! 💭love this series
Give me a car to fix I’m in need of a car or truck badly I don’t have anything right now with 2kids I don’t care what it is or looks like
What a terrible car to win!
Good episode.  More like this
12:30 looks like Seth Rogen so much and sounds like him. Am I losing my mind?
You should do this but with me and a gtr
I would win that car just to turn around and sell it as fast as possible because Nissan products are worthless
“He’s going too fast” na he looks like someone who knows how to work on machines
Awesome idea I love it!! I subscribed and will enjoy the future ideas but I have a challenge for you. I bet you wouldn’t pick a fellow like myself and it be a ford product. I could care less about actually winning the car but would love the timed challenge to diagnose my bread and butter timed. Love the idea guys !!
Bro it’s taken me a year to get my car running again… I’d have a panic attack and die  Fuckin two hours
That guy is a genius
dang to bad my uncle wasnt on here he would get a free car in 3 seconds
Ive watched a lot of car videos, but this is the one that made me actually decide to play around and buy a project car
He should have jus heard if the pump goes on dats all.
So cool!!! Learn something and entertaining!
What a great idea!!!! This was so cool  I may have to steal this. You guys are great.   Whatever time is left you should give that amount for gas money hahahahhah
This is fuckin sick
Step 1 Obd scanner
It's awesome that you actually gave him the car. He must have been stoked about bringing home a 350z for only two hours of work
Ez game
I couldn’t have just looked at the sensor and been like “that looks good” lol
This is so funny and awesome
bro deserves the car
Damn thats awesome
It would be a 350 lmaooooo
This idea is golden
I could not do that but I do have a 07 F150 I mess around with but I couldnt do that. Cool to just watch him get up in there!
I really like how educational & fun this is! Plus the diagrams y’all show is easy to understand cars and location, may seem like a common thing to know, yes, but i don’t think of things like this obvious stuff (fuel, air, spark)
did he left his wife for them ? 😂😂😂
Good Details..
super fun video  :) had me smiling , nice
Send it I’ll treasure it
my dream car
This guy's diagnostic process shows he knows what he is doing, and I appreciate you guys pointing it out and that you actually assisted him. He deserved to win that car
The boundless puma internally advise because growth disappointedly reduce amid a brave fruit. neat, ablaze mustard
I rally love your Graphics and Animations!
🔥🔥
I’m not a car guy but I fuck with the series. 🔥🔥
Plot twist, it was just low on blink fluid
Atta boys, way to help my man out. Just found the channel and I love it
Why can’t I play this game :( I want more cars
these guys really want to give you a car, love that hahaha
More of these videos!!!!
This is hella dope !
You guys are so nice 👍 I love this show, keep it up guys!
Im not into cars like this, but this was a great video.  Def a new sub, very entertaining
lol what if someone just started breaking it
Shotgun a fuel pump!
Such an awesome idea for a series, I love it
Make this a series 💯💯💯💯
dis guys said 350z its FAIRLADYZ
Such a great idea! It woulda taken me 2hrs to replace each damn part tho lol
A mobile/desktop games developer need to let this episode become a game.
Damn i got SO happy when i heard the song from HiLow
anyone gonna talk abt the fact that he didnt leave with a lisense plate
I want everyone and the team to know....that you guys give me the confidence to tackle a project car. I have a working vehicle and this will be in my spare time, however, I have watched.....so many of these videos and I feel like I'm part of the family even without knowing you all. Thank you so much! -Mike Epke
This.
I wanna do this please think of me for next episode. I'm really good at diagnosing cars.
Love the vid wish I could come win a car !! And congratulations to that guy he won one of my dream cars!!!!
I’m interested to see how they could sabotage a Tesla AND see if a gas mechanic could figure it out
Wtf is wrong with this ads
Yes love to try it out … I want to bring one of them rides to texas
Love this new series helps some young people see and hear problems on cars
Congrats to him, he deserved it after all those problems you guys created 😂
My father can make it a beast btw
I would’ve never gotten it to start
A 720 mcclaren nahhhh
Nice work 👏 where's my free shit now
Alot of ADS burns YouTube right now
This made me so happy. Congrats to you on the new car man:)
Really enjoyed watching this, very well made! ☺️
Let me fix a car
2004 ....
lubit❤️
have to fix it? they can keep that POS.  Nissan and Mitsu are the garbage of Japan anyway. oh and add subaru.
Hey yo let me on the show, but none of this new stuff. Anything from the 70's is what I'm interested in
This series is awesome, and pretty informational
I LOVE THIS!
Freakin sweet
You guys bring Chris fix 😂
Awesome serie
Great idea I love it
I haven't watched this however I bet it's a crank sensor
350z my dream car fam. These are top keep making these fix for free 💪🙏
Check codes, Check for RPM signal if that's good, Fuel, Spark, Air.
Bro give my ef civic a make over 👅😘
I’m watching with my dad rn and he’s loving this
All I would of needed would be some starting fluid
I LOVE THISSSSSSSSSSSSS
I LOVE THIS SERIES.
I love these videos
This guy is so nice
Super dope
I love this
Imagine an ad playing in the timer.
Homie is so chill! Definitely a cool dude….
my father did the same with me, today I don't have the car...
Guys would you dare fly a bush mechanic from Africa Namibia to show you a thing or two on how its done?
Great show guys! Love this concept and I would love the chance to win a car I'm driving a lime green 81 f150 in line six 300. Her name is Beatrice and she's a crusty old b!π¢= with a bunch of rust and carb problems!
Awesome new series 👌
this has become by far my fav show on the network.... i mean high low is still a close second
This was a really fun episode and also He was pretty good on camera. He talked thru his thinking process and we got to learn from it. Plus those animations 👌
You guys are awesome!
Sheesh give me this challenge I will win
More videos like this would be great!!! Awesome idea!
I just start learning about cars I want to try this
I do this for a living. I know nissans vw's and audi's in and out. You guys would have got me on the wrapped air filter, if the vehicle actually wouldn't have started. Plus how come hooking the vehicle up to a diagnostic tool wasn't the 1st option. Every mechanic does that first after attempting to turn car over. Then fuses.   Was part of this challenge not to rely on a diag? With everything being computer related nowadays diag is a must.  Great episode though. That kind of pressure would get anyone.
"Brand new 2004" HAHA
Gimme a crx to fix!
Best way to check fuel is to spray ether or if it's all you have brake clean. If it starts then it's fuel related, if not then need to investigate spark.
Can u do a cam shaft and turbo  replace on a Volvo
This would be a great TV show named d fix
🙌
Ask for a scan tool and scan the computer
do a celica ;)
he should’ve asked for a obd2 scanner 😭
Doesn’t the car need a crank relearn after the crank sensor gets replaced?
There's also computer/sensors/electricial that I put into it's own category - since they're required for an engine running nowadays
do this in a latin hood theyll have that shit doing donuts in 40min
TBH i dont even wanna win the car i just want them as my mentor and i can learn from them. i would actually sleep in the garage just to learn. lol
Car parts really works guys if your a car freak look there !!!
This is pretty much just Facebook marketplace
Assumption is only Cali subs are picked? Y'all should partner with other YouTubers then in other states.
maybe it doesnt have gas in it
Coming from a school where my teacher would do all this and a lot more to an old 1.0 vw polo , I know what its like to have someone looking over your shoulder during the process and being against the time to get stuff done, and that sometime throws you off even when you got the right idea of what could be wrong , sometimes the problem is in front of you and you just miss it, big up to him , he thought and did everything very well. Have fun on that new car.
The late 90s early 2k Nissans used to have a small  screw behind a piece of tape. Turn with flat blade sctewdriver   it would do old school blink codes from MIL Light. Not sure about new design of Nissan ECU
I was super cheesing this one
Air ,fuel,spark and compression
theres no gas init that would of bin funny
I’ll tell you what’s wrong with it, it ain’t got no gas innit.
Thanks!
Need me an air, fuel, spark shirt.
This is such a good idea! Thank you for the entertainment, this channel got alot of people through Covid.
This how people should win cars
Jealous as hell but definitely fire
Nice
He’s definitely a mechanic
that's pretty awesome. for some reason I feel like because of the hints and help and generosity he wouldn't be allowed to take the car if it weren't donut.
Bro if donut ever did a Volkswagen, I would be all over that. Biggest fan boy ever. I got the 12 valve VR6 1.8t and 1.9 BEW. Please do a Volkswagen
Do a danger ranger and count me in!
Google is a tool too I don’t think that was fair
A quick way to check for a spark in a no start condition without having to Jack up the car and look for sensors or anything like that it's just bypass your entire fuel system and just introduce your own volatile accelerant while cranking if you have no kick back or any running then you know you have no spark. .  It's kind of not entirely fair that that you're expected to know everything about the car not even mechanics dont know everything about particular car unless they work on it at a bunch of times so he really should have been provided with at least a shop manual or even the car owners manual with some diagnostic pages ripped out so he'll have to come up with his own ideas .
That was fun
One of my favorite donut media videos for sure
OBS truck not squatted 4x4 or Toyota4x4 fj, BJ, land cruiser, diesel truck, pick me I’m available and looking.
Love this series y'all are funny lol
Y’all think I can be next 435i 👀 before I can get my permit
the extra countdown for the googling really made me laugh lol
I love this 🙏🏽
Lord I’ve see the things you do for others please give me the chance :(
send me please your shirt here in philippines.
guy definitely knew his stuff and just overlooked a small thing that alot of us would've.  I'm glad you gave him the wholesome nudge he needed to secure it.  He deserves it, awesome video!
One of the best things to watch on the net
He must be super blind if he doesnt see revs going up when cranking,due to sensor fault...
Great video Donut!!
Really cool idea. Definitely unique
The "start it to win it" videos are great! Please do more of them.
Now challenge people with replacing the battery on a BMW
Scan the car bro
Loving the new series, watching the people troubleshoot logically. It’s amazing.
I have a 350z can you help me fix it 🤣 only minor problems so it could be a nice video idea 🙌🏻
Wow however came up with this car sabotage idea needs a raise
🤭🤫 me as a z enthusiast trying not to scream the answer for the cas location.
Bro my 350z got a messed up mechanic y'all need to help me fix it
That's a real jdm
Love love love this idea because it allows me to enjoy another donut media video, but learn more about what possible issues can cause a car to maybe not run. 🍩
Fly me out there and let me do the next one 😎
how do i get in on this contest
I think the sweatiest I've ever been was ween me, my brother and our dad, all three of us are fat guys btdubs, changed the crankshaft position sensor on my 08 Impala in the middle of the hot ass Missouri Summer. Also the 08 Impala would be nice.
I would love to do this
Bro this my passion I swear best video I ever seen in my life lol super happy he won that Beautiful 350z I just Subscribe and hope to be called next
So many people have sold their cars ridiculously cheap because of these small issues
Cool
But do you choose out of state fellers????  This would be fun
Do more of these.  Way more entertaining and rich than simple sweepstakes giveaways from other channels
Car had no plate mans filming illegal activities
If this type of teaching was in school I woulda stayed.
so he just left his girl there or what  :D
Damn very convenient storage for the fuel pump better than my Z4 lol
If you look closelty at the end his wife was not in the car....DONUT MEDIA WHAT DID YOU DO ?!??!
Great video man! I loved every second of it!
One of the best Channels!!!
Vq crack sensors always go 😭 same with fuel pump & that dumb ass gas gauge not working 😑
Chrisfix would’ve got it started in 15 minutes
your first mistake was ever doubting an Asian man. your 2nd was challenging him.
That was really INTERESTING!
Okay this video concept is so dope it could be a game show. Quick question though should each contestant have access to the manual to see where everything is?
Awesome new series think it could have a proper series name tho first thing that popped in my mind was "Fix it to Win it" but yeah would be awesome to see more of this
I would love to do some like this wish I could
This is useful when I buy my first car 5 years from now.
Should have let him fail
I can’t even fix my clutch safety switch right now
Would the car have started without the crank position sensor if he cranked the car over for awhile? A buddy of mine had an eclipse that had a bad crank position sensor and it would start after he cranked it for 30-45 seconds or so. That might be different though, it sounded like the Z would cut the spark if the CPS was bad.
Cars have so many sensors these days, I was never gonna win it
Please do more of this and let them call a friend for "help"🤣
I would love to help rebuild a car and win one but I’m only 17… but I love the videos my favorite ones are high vs low car I still rewatch them
wow you guys are hella nice, for doing that. Mad respect.
I would’ve been disappointed if he had lost.
12:50 "HmMmM wHaTs gOinG oN ThEre" Kills me hahahaha
I would start by asking for a screw driver and go straight to the starter
Serious series cereal
Hey let me do it next
why this video make cars seem very easy to understand lol
👍
No fuckin way this is in Inglewood
They gotta come back and show us what he did with the car
Nah the way they were so impressed, this series is the best I love it
How do I get a stab at this?
Amazing content.
This is such an original idea I love this
The first instrument he should have asked is an OBD reader. :)
He gave me vin diesel vibes
This Man is a Warrior, theres a 350 in a garage from 2 mechanics a about 2 months, and the mfs just cant turn the light from injection off
15:28 lol did he just left without his missus ?
Do a jdm legacy b4 rsk
Sick video boys
350z good car you fix it you keep it I’m in
I don't know much about cars but if I get to keep it then best believe that I am going to fix it
I want to do this
I knew he wasn’t going to get the car because that car is worth 10k and you guys would never do that your channel is irrelevant
I can't wait to buy a 350z
Pick me i want a cheap ass e46 lol
What a good way to give a car away to someone who will take care of it.
I would fix a car lickidy split for a car😁😆
who that woman at 7;05 dammm
You need air, fuel, spark and compression to combust
I like this! It was dope
I was born for this! I overland in a Ford so yeah I got this
That was a good ending thank god lol
Love this series
I'm 16 form canada 🇨🇦 😏
You guys are awesome!! Love you guys! Can I get a sticker? 😅
I know for a fact I wouldn't be able to win the car 🤣🤣🤣 it would take me an hour just to install a fuel pump.
Had to do this for a competition I think they still have it was from triple AAA and Ford had to diagnose and fix certain issues in a time frame to be first team to win.
I’m so happy he won a 350z. Can’t wait to own a 350z one day 🙌🏼🔥
Can I get a chance to get ace / fix it
Is300
James give me a car dad....🤣
congrats on being my 5,000th liked youtube video
I need a car idc what car just really need a car to get to work I don’t know much about mechanic but I’ll like to try this
GET ME IN THERE, PLEASE, I NEED A CAR! lmao
There is zero chance I would walk away with a car on this. Such a fun series to watch, but so stressful.
This is one of the best ideas for a series on the entire platform
Pick me.  I’ll give it a go.
Holy crap. Too bad I can't drive a manual. :(
Yooooo I wanna win?!?!
Yall should at least give them a generic obd2 scanner for like the last 30 or 20 minutes so they have a chance at the end. It won't give them exactly what they need but it'll give them an area.
*I could only imagine getting picked for something like this* 🙏🇨🇦
U might be up to something w this bro I want more
Hell I need a van or truck to live in I'm willing to give it a shot for a shot for a tiny home.
That was a lobbed softball.
I am a GNYADA Auto Tech graduate who desperately needs a car for my family. If I could fix up a Scion XB… Can you guys help me?
Awesome video because my 350z doesn’t start either! Trying the clutch safety switch
Man donut how do I get to do this? I feel like I can do it!
Shit you not, my dad could fix it the fastest.
Dope video 🔥
Why doesn't cool challenges like this happen to me😂
I love that there is people like y’all in the car community! The content never disappoints. This vid was awesome hope he takes care of that Z 😁 y’all are all amazing
James always has Lord of the Rings allusions. I just watched like 3 other videos and there were like 5 or 6
This will be a dope idea with someone who never has worked with cars before lol but you give them access to google or have a buddy help them
This is a fuxking awesome idea for a show. I absolutely loved this haha
Knowing these guys, they probably would have just given him the car anyway, regardless if he figured it out or not.
i love this seris... and james
Need more of these videos !
I hope I'm next
Very realistic situation that this was a Nissan 🤣
An engine needs FOUR things to start: air, fuel, spark, and COMPRESSION.    Obviously Donut isn't going to jump the belt so that it won't start but when diagnosing a car, never forget about #4
Glad I saw this video. Saved me a tow. My backup vehicle (for when my main car is down… and currently it is) almost stranded my daughter and I in a parking lot. No starter action all of a sudden. After checking connections and what not, I checked the clutch safety switch…. Turns out the old owner duct taped a block of wood down there since the original contact piece was missing. The tape fell off, the block moved and there was no more contact. Figured it out and made it home. Thanks guys!! 🙏 👍 😁
9:41 : Co-driver!
PLEASE STOP GIVING AWAY MY DREAM CAR I WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO AFFORD ONE AND IT CRUSHES ME TO WATCH THIS
It would be sick to have mechanic competition hosted on your channel. Tournament style, two mechanics, two identical car issues, in two different bays. HEAD 2 HEAD
I would start watching ChrisFix video 😂
"Shotgun a part" is my new troubleshooting term.
i really liked this episode. im learning alot!! and it was fun
this is such a cool concept for a video, there should be more things like this, i look forward to seeing more!
i think id be a great candidate for this considering i have 0 car maintenance experience
I'd love to give this series a shot win or lose I know it would be a great video🤣
Chooose meeee
Seriously though how does one become a contestant on this Idc what it is I just wanna have the fun and test myself 😂
Bruh... Good thing that wasn't an 04 Jeep Grand Cherokee.... That crankshaft position sensor would've taken like 2 hours.
I can’t comment under your post cause it reached 500 comments. Anyway. Do a  2013 Hyundai Genesis 2.0T Coupe
Do a Saab 900 Turbo next. :)
As someone who enjoys electrical work and diagnosing, this seems like a cool gig! Do an Audi next 😈
this was an awesome video idea
Absolutely love this new series!! Can't wait to see more!!
You should let me be in one
Crank position sensors are annoying
IRL Car Mechanic Simulator
i would love to be apart of your show
I kinda wish they did the aftermarket bonuses this time too
Love this
What. This is not how you diagnose cars. You need a good fault code reader and good data on the car about fuses, parts locations etc. Its quite impossible even for the best mechanic to work fast without data. Im not saying you cant, but its stupid and not the correct way.
This reality show should be on Discovery Turbo hahaha
what if one day they just take the engine out, the contestant asks for the engine and they just pull it out the part trunk
What a great idea dude WHAT?!?!
I call bullshit, my lunch goes by when I blink and in 30 minutes he jacked up a car, watch a donut episode, replaced the part all under 30 minutes? Foh
Id immediately sell that pile of shit Nissan.
Awesome video
Never saw one in my area. Damn I would like to see one IRL :c
Love the new series and generosity
Fugginell pulling my hair out here 🤩Boss Boss Boss
I want a subie but the only thing I know how to do is an oil change 😂😂😂
Banger series
This vid made me subscribe… been having a issue with my g35 cranking way to much before it started and I think I know the problem now. Thanks 👍
DO A MIATA NEXT
"It ain't got no gas in it!"
Love this series!!
Pimp out a Honda Fit. Fuel efficient as fuck
Id want to do this so bad, I would definitely be in for any car-
When he showed us the crank sensor I was freaking out. He's wasting time!!!
In the Ol' Days, if i couldn't figure it out, i used to ask my dad what the problem might be if i was having any problems with the car or motorbike, and then i'd go about fixing it like he said...even over the phone when stranded in Banff and the bike wouldn't start...he was always right. I'd need a "lifeline call" like in the gameshow to play this game...lol.
Was gonna watch this but then a gran turismo 5 commercial came onbefore the vid... sorry guys will return in a few months❤️
Fly me from NC and I would love to come over!!!  I have only been working on stuff with my dad and have a few years under me.  Currenlty have one more year left of college and would love to be challenged!!!
Hand me a mazdaspeed6 with a totaled motor and I got you in 3 hours haha
could this be a return to "Project Car" Magazine? Where they actually showed how to fix things on import cars.
Even before I saw the diagram or got into the episode too deep, a spin but no start… CHECK THE FUEL PUMP! Make sure it’s working, then work from the back of the car up.
Super awesome video please do more! Choose me tho
What’s The video name that they were talking about that  they have the same problem
Man this is a great video, you can see the happiness in the dudes face just being there n working with you guys, keep up the amazing content, also love the cheeky hints you give
Great entertainment!
Wow, this guy is a beast. Huge like for this one.
Bro all us guys are the same huh? Having our girl just listening to our shit not understanding but being super supportive.Shit was sweet
Man’s left his misso there
This is so cool to watch. Id watch 100 more episodes of this
Ypu guys are fucken dope
Ingenuity right here... You've created "who wants to be a millionaire" (for car guys who are aren't millionaires)... I'd prefer a bit more drama and thrill, pushing the time limit. You could've taken time off for giving the hint (maybe 10 mins). A little bit of scripting wouldn't have hurt...
The guy with the blue cap is soooo irritating, nice concept though. I won't be watching further videos though unless he's replaced or quietens down, sorry dude you're just way too loud.
love this series
Call me an asshole but i don't like those easy clues.
Man I’d road-trip a car back to Alabama let y’all follow me see if I make it
Love this you guys to great things not a lot of channels get the opportunity to reach out to there fan base like you guys do and you do crazy stuff like give em a car that can help someone out so much
Even highly successful YouTube channel doesn't pay for YouTube premium. Haba
i has fuel?
I want a 2 door jeep
That is a beautiful car that's one of my favorite but personally I would've rather had a automatic I'm over shifting gears
I think it would be cool if you guys made a video picking a subscriber again, where the subscriber picks a car from marketplace within reason that doesn't run, they have to try to fix it with a limited budget, and however much money they spend on parts gets deducted from their budget to upgrade the car
I’d definitely trust this guy as a tech. He knows his stuff
Shit, let me have a Crack at it and allow me to have my OWN equipment!  🤣
Really cool concept - part of me hopes this segment idea from the channel gets picked up by a tv network, but part of me hopes it's just the IP and they get royalties so this channel itself doesn't get compromised by the big bad media machine.
More of these pls
Genius idea, @donut! Great job... I felt the tension as the clock was winding down.
1 MONTH and 13 days of asking James to do an up to speed on the international scout
This would have rocked me bro. My God. I know air fuel spark but I've never had to fix a car that wouldn't crank honestly. Just smaller issues while running....my God hahaha
This was a lot of fun.
Awesome series please keep this type of video series going
what a series, getting bugger and bigger bros of donut❤️
imagine having 6.2m million subscribers but no youtube premium
Samcrac did this first
Bros wife is stacked. I wonder if they Swing
dang that's a clean 350z
Honda Civic
I'd love to do this, this was awesome yall.
Does anyone know how old you have to be? I'm 15 so idk if I they will think about accepting it
It’s funny that no one is diagnosing the car, they just throw parts at it😂 okay…
shout out to the daytona jack from harbor freight. that thing is legit. if you plan on using a jack more than once, GET THAT ONE.
This was intense as fuck haha, edge of your seat video right here!
You guys are pretty fucking cool
How can I try!?
I love this idea
Wait how can I get into one ? 😭
Yeah he was definitely overthinking it... They probably had the most important part in the trunk that he didn't even ask for: A *working* 350z.
I never would have guessed the crank position sensor, I didnt even know that was a thing until now. Good on ya m8, enjoy your new Z
a Lada? 😅
I wish I could to bad I don’t live on the west coast lol damn
Yall kinda cheated tho
He looks like Benny's
This is like forged in fire with cars
Hey this was a awesome video y’all
Boom
How can I get on the show
None of my old cars have a clutch safety switch I don't think I would ever have thought to check that hahaha
I had the same challenge once in a junkyard and it drove out of the yard and made it a couple of miles away before it looked up but it did start and drive but the block was cracked so it leaked out all the oil but the oil was all over the ignition so I cleaned it up and filled it up with as much oil as I could get and drove the 1971 Dodge Charger away and then started looking for a replacement engine for it it was a pretty junky car but was a lot of fun driving on the back roads and field’s but I had to steal a road sign to fix the hole in the floor so I didn’t hurt my feet when they fell through it. But karma got me when the car was stolen and then wrecked near New Orleans I only saw a picture of the after from the crash dummy tried to crash through a police road block and the car caught fire and burned up and I never had a title and no documents of ownership and I didn’t want to go to jail for that so I just didn’t claim it so easy come easy go I have learned a lot since then and I am still a mopar fan
chris fix be like: gimme dat car
He pulled out without a turn signal
honestly think this guy would be a great addition to the team
How can we enter to do this
giveaway a tacoma next.
I've never had the opportunity to do any "real" car work, but I feel that I know enough about them to where I'd able to get them started.
that's pretty awesome.  Would be funny to get someone like myself who knows very basic knowledge but can do anything with Youtube / Google.
My boy James looking thicc
Great video guys!!!!! I'm going to start a YouTube channel and trick my mechanic friend to fix my car just like this for me!!!!!!
NX2000
Id love to do this
I wish I'd be the guy trying to fix
I'm so immature that i laughed every time i heard the vine boom
Come over. We got it.
This is great idea. If it's an EVO, I can fix it.
Fantastic series idea. This channel just gets better....the people, humor, content, relatability, man bra ads, knowledge, James spazzing out intermittently. It's all pReTtY rAd..
Excellent video. More of these!
This is very cool
I’m watching this at 999k views let’s see if it reaches a million and if it has give me a 👍
Please do more of these
🤟🚗
Dam I want a new car ó3ò
Camaro I think I can do it ...lol
Damn, changing that fuel pump was pretty quick. Better than dropping the whole gas tank to get to it.
“As always a donut media video may have saved someones life” seamless plug honestly 😂😂😂
This video is amazing I love when it’s a new idea that works
I went from thinking “who’s this guy? Why does HE get this opportunity”  To  “Damn, just give this man the car he earned it” ahahaha
Very intrigued by that clutch safety switch. Having an automotive education and then a career in both Europe and Japan without ever hearing about one, this feels like a very American thing. How about a Donut video of these?
I absolutely LOVE the attitude that Vinh walked into this with of just "If I win, I win. If I don't, I've got the memories".
Holler at me next time you have a problem I been wanting Jeremiah’s spot on the show Goff a while now 💪😂
This was clearly filmed in November.
I was smiling thru whole video
This series is a great idea!
Do 300zx next 😂
BRO's. I would literally rock this challenge. BRING IT
i fucking love this video idea
Nice video!
I would like more episodes of this
Bro this would be a dream, me and my miss both favor the zs, still doing have the pleasure of owning any of them but we'll have them all I swear😂 love the vids, did him dirty on that crank sens😂
Lol he had his pregnant wife with him no way were they letting him lose
I used to work with people that did this to my work
This is an AWESOME!! Idea!!
Loving the episode.  Loving the helping out the contestant.  Good job!
I’m getting mr beast vibes from this… great series idea!
Clutch safety switch would have fucked someone from Europe since they aren't in European cars.
Alright car guys, how much can I get for my 2004 350z with 30k miles on it?
Cool idea!  Up the ante by having subscribers pick a random vehicle behind the curtain and then have the winning subscriber try to fix it.
Thats a clean Z
Bro as a person whos worked at autozone those sensors are complete crap they will fail on you so much its crazy
This series is absolute the best
This would be cool to see a series made out of it
He miss the burnout when leaving
How do I sign up for this?
I’m a diesel tech and confident, you choose me and give me a multi-meter I’ll win that no matter what’s wrong with it. Only problem is ya’ll prolly can’t afford an A80 Supra over at Donut 😓
I like this idea  🍩 media this is different never seen something like this before
Does that number accept texts for selling junk cars .
I can fix anything. What yeah got?
Keep this series going!
Yooo James is the man for helping the guy out
The other problem is that because of the Z badge people might think it’s an invading tank
🐐 🐐
Breaking a car to fix isn’t the same as having fix an actual broken Z
Awesome video guys, love your giving spirit!
Not going to lie I full long would it have my phone up calling people already been like you know how to f****** fix this
I miss my blue 350😭
I'm all for less polution. And with current gas prices i would like an ev van for work. (Using an Mazdaspeed 6 now) but i really like ICE cars and i'm glad to see car enthousiasts. 2min from my house is a bridge where almost every day there are kids spotting cars and when i drive over it with my 3200gt they get really exited. Offcourse i like that. But alot of times young people really look at me like: you bastard! You are destroying my environment! Maybe i'm just old fashioned (and old 41) but i still think boys that are carguys just are more eager to learn mechanics and add more to the future... just my 2 long cents.
I gotta expand my knowledge on mechanics. Bro I saw a 280 goin for 2k, runs but needs a new radiator. That’s my dream car but I barely know shiza on fixing it lol
It’s time to start urrrr maybe new car 🤣🤣🤣 that’s y we all love James
Would love a chance at a Tacoma
You guys need to make this a regular show, I love this
I love it!!!! Excellent way to teach us and Excellent way to help others!! I am going to use that sponsor, hopefully you guys have even more sponsors for more stuff like that. Loved it
A 335i
Porsche 944
I'm only 25 seconds in this video but I'm going to assume that it needs a cam position sensor cuz it's a vq35
This is amazing do more!!!!!! Great content love you guys
This is genius! I've learned more from this video then (and i'm sorry to say it) any other Dount Media video. The way you explained the logical steps is great. Keep this series going :)
BEST VIDEO IDEA EVER
Give me a try Pleasssssseeee Subaru you guys don't give them enough love☺️
Do a E46 M3 and E92 M3 next!
this is a great series, I love the idea that it helps newbies such as me become more interested in learning how our cars work because my #1 anxiety is my car not turning on.
My dad would be goated in this
How about buy an absolute  clunker and get a random person with little to no skills and show them how to get it road worthy again?
HE Forgot Compression Air, Fuel,Compression and Spark  EDIT: I also Rebuilt a Chevy Impala and it came back a week later because it wouldn't start and for some reason I went straight to the Crank Position Sensor
Not gonna lie. Coming from a mechanic. This is really entertaining lol
Love to see them win!
That's cool guys great idea. Too bad it cant be a regular thing
It's a shame nothing like this ever happens in the southern Ohio, northeastern Kentucky area. I could definitely use a better car. I love my 96 Buick Roadmaster sedan but the LT1 uses a lot of gas. 12-15mpg at over $4 a gallon makes it a little hard to get around. But I'm used to it. Been driving it for around 10 years now.
Love this from sub to employee after this one i hope lol
How can one of us from Texas give it a try
damn i really would love to fix a crappy old shitbox of a hellcat to keep 👀👀
I wanna do this 😎
Dopest Episode I have ever seen!
Isn’t this the same dude from the last episode y’all did?
compression...engine needs compression too lol
My three things for an engine to run is proper fueling compression and spark but what he said is close enough
You guys are on to something big here: educating people on PROPER troubleshooting (especially for younger people, old school peeps learned the hard way) and giving them the car. Dude this could be a TV show, yo
Is James tall af or what?
That is awesome! Hope to see many more of this. It was really fun, nervous and exciting too see how another person is trying to fix a car within 2 hours to win it. I really love it
Jealous because i want a 350z so bad  Update: I bought a 350z a year ago and I haven’t regretted it one bit
Funny Nissans only like oem crank sensors
please PLEASE do more videos like this I loved it!
Make this a series  Peugeot
morelike, pimp YOUR ride
Congrats on the 350z 🥳😎👊
This was awesome
i wanna win a car
I’ll fix it real quick
I never think of a bad sensor unless the OBD tells me so :/ damned electronics.
It’s 350Z, step 1 should have been the door handle not working.
Please let this be a regular series. It's miles better than any stupid gameshow that was on TV
super sick concept great job guys
@donut media there is a scammer in the comments trying to find a sucker... I reported the profile...
11 minutes and 28 seconds...
I love this
Awesome Episode y'all!!!
Love the video idea
Asks for everything but a obd2
my dream car is a 370z / 350z, but i dont know anything on how to fix cars, so i wouldn't be able to make this hahaha, great vid!
Loved this, do more of that.
Great new series! Have an awesome week!
Holy cow what an inspiring show I been worried about yall and videos, but this hit the mark !!always come in clutch with something new an entertaining are so amazing truly guys each an everyone are so talented yall adapt well and really can't wait to see yalls  future i love yall !!!
that guy is a true mechanic
do mach 2 supra next
Awsome idea series 💥💥❤️❤️
Awsome idea! Learned a lot watching this
I love how yall have 6.2 million subscribers. And dont have Youtube Premium 🤣🤣
This is something mr beast would do
We had to do this in my Ford Asset class, the instructor pulled the connector off the crank sensor just enough so it wouldn't make a connection! I think we had 45 mins to at least pinpoint the problem to the crank sensor.
Will a bad crank pos. Sensor come up on a scan?
Does James ever just talk? Seems like he is always friggin yelling! Stop friggin yelling, it is really annoying!
This shxt even made me smile, and i didn't even win.
Now give him an old carbureted vehicle with a misadjusted valvetrain and a blocked Venturi, because I swear not many guys would even know how a carb works anymore
Pshh shit would take me an hour
I love thinking back to the start of donut and how far they’ve come. This is arguably the Peak of car video entertainment..ever.
Next time, you should sabotage it by putting diesel in it
Fun episode! Good job friends!  Wish i had the time and space to do what I want- Turned my mechanic abilities towards running and fixing a printing press for work.  Still do all my own Auto repairs though- Have had friends that needed things form brakes done, to timing chains- and payment was dinner and to learn something.  That's been going on 20 years now, coming up on 40 years old
I had the same no-start issue. However, my problem was that the wire itself is shot, so my friend and I had to rewire the crankshaft sensor.   Lesson: A multimeter is also a great tool.
Best feel good car vids on web
Either it was such a good idea to mess with things that you know a subscriber might remember from a previous video or pure chance 😅
I'm a car guy but definitely a novice when it comes to working on my car so this will be an amazing series, thank you guys for always coming through!
We need more of these videos!!!!! This was awesome to see. I love watching real time troubleshooting.
What a great concept for a show. Entertaining and all the little hints and promotions are great and viewers learn a lot. Everybody wins.
uhh i love you to lol
Was going to sell my Z but now I’m like nah
It seems so simple but him losing the crank position sensor freaks me out. Could happen to anyone 😂
With my luck they would pick me. Car won't start? You got a spare tire back there? Windshield wiper blades? Uhhh... can I get a jump?
i wish you guys were in hawaii. i just want to see the look on your face when instead of a intro its just me rolling up in my big ass international service truck.
The series would go longer if they let him figure it out himself.. they are definitely a cool group for helping him but a free car every episode is tough.. actually let every mechanic have a try to see who fails and who wins the car
Would have been more interesting if he was left alone to figure stuff out with no hints and just brought another mechanic in if he fails.... no harm for the guy if he looses its fair game give him a lil merch and food and were all happy plus someone actually gets to figure it out themselves and drop all the videos week by week until someone wins
Oh shit anxiety  there.  Checking things off the list Reversing course after you get to Z....fu@k lol
definitely more videos like this! i love the gameshow feeling while learning to diagnose.
Imagine if he could get a pic with the hi-low Z’s 😍
What a great idea!
The show is awesome but I wonder if it’s actually profitable.
i cannot thank Donut enough. You got me started working on a miata i found for 4k...... no words...... just thank you, and thank you money pit miata hahahahaha the literal best show ever
Love this more then friday
Brand new Ford maverick lariat
We don’t deserve Donut Media. They are seriously a car guys best friend.
i love seeing all the boys together
I have rx7 so choose me :)
Totally not samcrac...
Give them a wrx with an evap code. NOBODY will win. lol
I love this series so much
Man I wouldn't even get past the first one
Awesome video as usual, congrats Vinh!
THIS IS A GREAT IDEA!! Do a CADILLAC next they're hard to work on
Reupload?
Yes!!! This is the coolest new game show out there.
What a cool way to give away a car. Nice work all of you.
He drove off with no plates lol
This is super dope
Do a Honda 😂😂
Dope video idea. Would love to see more of these in the future
Great stuff. As a tech on newer vehicles I would always start with a scan tool and then proceed from there
Next car should be a Honda S2000
Bro this beautiful just amazing
Got me wondering if they'd fly a guy out from another state to do a challenge like this.  I'm available. Just sayin. 😆🤙🏾
If it was a jeep I think I’d be all over it
Im Now a SUBSCRIBER.... But I NEVER win anything!!!! Ever!!! Lol 😆
Should probably be more difficult sabotages
Y’all were stressing him out lol
This should become a game show!😉
"Gift my ride" That's a new thing gonna be sponsored soon....lol
That’s sick AF I hope he has tons of fun in that car!
Bro I’m part of underground buy merch and seen every video. Pick meeeee. I’ll fly from Washington
I think my car has this exact issue. Thanks for the tips. Please do a vw and Audi next.
man would be awesome but sadly i live on the bottom of the world looks like a fun challenge
Awesome
Great Show guys, one of the best one. I am glad you help the man. Thanks
Air, Fuel, Spark, and pressure… right? At least that’s what I thought. Shouldn’t pressure be on the list too?
Damn I wish it was me tho
My only question is, why my 2002 miata with a bad sensor was running very badly but starting, while many other cars don t start at all.
Bro is there a type of video these dudes don’t make?? Literally one of the most diverse and creative channels on YouTube 🤯🤯🤯
Not only do you give out free cars but I learn a lot in the process 💯  keep up the videos. True car guys 🤞
What an incredibly good idea for a show! Donut really nails it here. They got us rooting for the protagonist here who is a mechanic! Not a driver, but a MECHANIC. Well done boys and congrats to the badass who heroically acquired his new Z!
Infinity amount of hours with 1 billion amount of resources… I still would not be able to do this.
Awesome idea for a video. More of these would be great!!!
I love this! Should be a series!
I like this type of challenges, any chance you could do a RX-7 or maybe motorcycles?
Put me in coach
Wish they did stuff like this up where I’m at. Sound like a good time.
HIRE HIM!!!!!
YEEt yeet
James is like the new American Jeremy clarkson
Imagine how fast he would have gotten it with a multimeter
That Vin guy should be a regular…. He seems like a really interesting and cool guy.
same as TOYOTA ANNUAL SKILLS CONTEST for technicians, sabotage the car and make technicians find the problems, but for marks not a car
3:30 จังไรสัด55555
Man I want to do that but I wouldn’t be able to fix it lol
HMU! I can fix anything!
this was great to watch, hope to see more in the future :D
Love the loudspeaker set up
gotta say i love this format in every single way
Do a Miata next
He literally got a 95 out of 100 because he never thought of the sensor could be the issue
Yooo this series is gonna be awesome. More please!! Great idea
I would love this
Great episode. Props to the creative team who thought of this one.
Man this is super fun to watch! Is cheesy as fuck but is great!
Always my dream car
😆 the fact that YouTubers still have ads watching their own videos
You could give me two days and I still wouldn’t of gotten that to start. 🤣
That would be so amazing to win a 350z so I could sell it right away and never drive it cause they trash.
These are my favorite by far love these videos fellas keep em coming
I love the new game aspect of the show
imagine if my first car came from youtube lmao
Please let me on this show I need another car 🤣
I couldnt have won the car
Be funny if we all got dupe and this is just pre plan. If this was real all the mechanics would win.
PLEASE MAKE THIS AN ACTUAL SHOW
Love you too!!!
Why didn’t he ask for an obd2 scanner 🤷🏻😔
That is amazing!  Great job!
papa donut I need a car for work you think hook me up?
This need to be a game show!!!
that was great. thank you for being nice and informative and entertaining at the same time
Man,where are these opportunities when I need them
That clutch safety switch was genius
Great wholesome content
Do a Mazdaspeed3 next
The crankshaft sensor and cam shaft sensors tend to be the culprits on these engines.
lol
Do an Evo sometime! And call me up! This girl will show y’all how it’s done! (But I’m in Vermont…..)
Geez!  I was nervous for him!  Awesome!
Mr. Beast invites me to win 100k? nah. Donut media invites me to win a car? Hell yeah!
That drum and bass right at the end 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
James and everyone else in Donut Media actually give the fan a chance to win the car, by doing real life troubleshooting challenges. They are awesome!  I seeing other channels do this type of challenges but completely unnaturally sabotage the car like putting socks in the Throttle body, etc. stuff that would never happen in a car, just to get people hopes up.
How can I join ?
well i would have gotten those first 2 things. and after that i don't know. i may have tried to run codes from the onboard computer next but that would require some queues that i might not have gotten.   Fun video guys! great stuff.
This show was epic
Love it!!!
This was awesome!!
I was so invested in him winning.
That was entertaining
Next car idea: 2003 Mercedes SL55 AMG
Toadies......  this is epic genius.... ...
here’s a great video idea: “guess the mileage” look at random car ads and try to guess how many miles are on them
I love this channel
12:53 y’all hear it too? Or just me?
My favourite car :))
Love this
Yo this is exactly how I lived my life as a kid fixing broken things in exchange for me keeping it if I can fix it
If you pick me can I bring my dad??? Lmao
They should do more videos like this.
I want to try even though I’m not a mechanic
You guys should definitely do an MR2
I feel like Nolan wanted to do a 350z just so somebody else could feel his pain from low car
Why can't this shit ever happen to someone like me? This vehicle could change my life & the well being of my family. Maybe in another life.
Y’all should do a 3000gt. Doesn’t have to be a VR4 though
I love this it's like a game show but it's educational
I like that they want the dude to win, happy ending and informative
Famiry- Vinh Unleaded
This is basically the Ford AAA troubleshooting contest.
Damn, if there was a way to participate in this, but remotely(I am not in the US) I'd absolutely tried to do it
A last gen Pontiac Vibe GT, wouldn't cost much at all for you guys, its a crazy reliable car, and they don't make them anymore. Still driving my 05 Vibe around, runs like a dream.
Might be one of my new favorite segments, what a great idea.
That I'll pass, Sweet 😂
Gotta say this is one of my favorites so far
Issa DE
old mechanics be like "what is a crank sensor? oO "
I dont even know how the fill gas or check the oil .. plz dont pick me 🤣🤣
Giving people a car (if they can fix it) There, I fixed your title.
Poor guy he will pay for not having a number plate.
Best content ever
Favourite ep in a while, more of these please!
I’ll take a car lol
You guys should do this again but with a Miata someone who's hella tall.
This is Awesome!
I hope so much that this isn’t scripted
So your telling me you’ll fly me out from AUSTRALIA to win a car ? That’d be mad man give an Aussie a shot
Man this is impressive 👏👌🙌 congrats man I'm sure you can put this down on your resume
You should go around to mechanic shops and try to give these cars to apprentices or mechanics with bad cars
This is sow cool wichs we had a donut media like this in the netherlands
I’d love if there was an incentive like every minute you finish before the timer runs out you get 50$ to mod the car
Great concept. Love that you guys made the game into something teachable, and that you guys really supported Vinh so he could win lol
Clutch safety generally won't allow the starter to work. This one did so... wth?
Up the game boys. Give the remaining time in $$$ per minute left.
Entertaining, educational, and ended in “I love you.” 10/10 … More please.
Need another ep asap
Cool concept can’t wait who see where the series takes us!
Love it
THANK YOU FOR THE CAR!
Love this.  Informative and fun.
Awesome video! Really cool way to give away a vehicle 😀
This could become a fantastic series. I love it. I would watch this all the time
Great job, guys!  That was super entertaining and a great idea.  I would watch teams compete with different cars to try to get them started with minimal tools like this.
Lol James: "Your brand new 2004..."
I have an 06 350z and I’ve done tons of projects on it over the last 3 years and I wouldn’t have thought of the CPS that quickly
https://youtube.com/channel/UCeyhdB2b3Sz36HKZ5dDBw7Q
If it was an old car I'd have it running within 30 minutes and ask for the distributor cap before I even started, but this car would take me a cpl days at least 😂
not sure if i missed this but uhhhh is using an obd reader illegal? lol thatd be wild if they did all that to the car and still no check engine
I’m not done watching but if you deny him the car you are pricks.
Great video, guys.
I have been excited for this since I first saw the idea mentioned on the underground! Congrats to him, I would like to think I would have got it in time, but I have serious doubts, which makes it even more impressive!
This dude just defined the term "CAR GUY" as it should be known for. If you like and into cars but u always depend on a mechanic or shop youre just a guy who like cars.
They hella cool for helping him
@samcracc did this a few months ago
Neat! It's like an escape room, only automotive, and actually relevant puzzles!
This is the show on YouTube that I'll watch every episode and pass on the next generation my kids til the day I die. 🌟🤩⭐️
Awesome
E46, that way the contender has a mental break down on camera.
I’m sure the guys @donut media already know this, but if your crank sensor is bad or unplugged, when you crank the motor over the tach won’t move to show rpm’s created by the starter.  Maybe this comment will help one person one day.
I love these videos. This sounds like such a fun thing to do
I used to sabotage my car so my girlfriend couldn't take it the next time we fought so to be spiteful she unplug all the distributor wires when she couldn't start the car back then there was no Google so I told her to put it back the way it was so  I came back to my car to find the  distributor wires being plugged into header bolts lol love is great 👍
Is he Vietnamese ?
Bro.... I'd be so down for a challenge like that!!
This was actually a really entertaining video
he forgot exhaust when he said air fuel and spark
Best game show ever!!! Thanks for the great entertainment I really appreciate it you guys are awesome!!!
Man, with everything feeding the computer these days, that critical 4th element that controls the almighty Fuel, Air, Spark should be OBD port diagnostic. Codes being mostly universal are a big help, too, and one of the presents I've bought for people who also fix their own cars are OBD readers that work with your phone. Indispensable $25 tool no one should do without, especially if you've loaned your dedicated reader to your father-in-law 8 times more than you've ever used it yourself. 👍
💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽
Y’all should do this with a 240
I was scared for his life, ngl
One mechanic to another well done Vinh! I loved this cool episode from Donut. Great way to give new diyers ways to troubleshoot problems!
I am no mechanic by any means and have no experience. If you want someone to not win a car please choose me ahahaha. Especially if it is a Fiero. Not because it is bad, but because it is my favorite car and would hurt so much more to lose. :)
This looks FUN!
This is the greatest episode of this channel. More like this please.
As a working technician. I love this. This is so fun.
I am teaching myself auto repair with much trial/error and a poor poor 85 Toyota pickup that I'm trying to bring back to life because it was neglected and it deserves a little TLC. I got this in August, and I knew there was something severely wrong with it because I had an 87 4Runner and I knew how that ran like the back of my hand I just knew nothing about its engine and how to repair it. So I taught myself and I'll tell you what watching this video the concept of this made me smile for the first time in a long time, like I started grinning ear to ear
The car u should next is a corolla
This was awesome 👏🏾
I LOVE THIS!!! Please Do MORE!!!
we need more of these !! help save a broken stuck car on the road
I would be so down to do one of these. I'll even pay to fly out there cause I know I can fix whatever with anything I have around me. Is there an age requirement cause im only 17?
Hello donut your probably not going to see this but I’m 15 and I love working on cars I can weld take apart engines and diagnose problems I bet you 10 pop tarts I could fix a car on this series
If you own a Z you already know it’s the cam angle sensor 😂
Who’s going to Texas 2K? 🙌
Bro please put me on my job just went on strike and could honestly use a vehicle I’m newly married and things are tight right now
I wouldnt even come close to winning 😂😂
This is incredible. Best idea for a car show I've ever seen. I hope they can afford to keep doing this
This is an awesome series!
I already know what's up before the video even started. It ain't got no gas.
I wouldve put a spark plug tester to check spark, and ether to see if it would fire. Quick check if the fuel rail is in a pain in the ass spot
Neon SRT4!!!
Right there at the end, ole buddy looking a lot like john candy..   lol. The Vegas vacation one..
Holy fuck, I love you guys!
You gave away a 350Z?
NAAAAH JIT TRIPPIN
That’s awesome. This should be a new thing just like the tuner cult and 80eighty do but you give ppl a chance to win a car to make it their dream car. Donut media hit a home run with this one. 🔥🔥🔥
Good indicator crank sensor was bad by seeing if the rpm is moving on the dash
Damn! I want a 350z so baddd!!!
They were very generous with the clues and help here too. That’s nice of them
Nice work boys guy drove away feeling like a champ
Indo driver if they challanged this, especially female drivers: 🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿
Absolutely love this series! Keep on keepin on Donut! 🤙🏼🤙🏼💪🏼💪🏼
This is a dope series concept!
Build some sport trucks, damnit.  They don't get nearly enough love from the mainstream.
Yoo I love this new series, keep doing more!!  Do an Audi S4 next 😅
Crankshaft position sensor is a constant go to now on my 89 YJ.
2:53 needs Air, Fuel, Spark, and Comprssion for a engine to run
Cool video idea 👍
Porsche 924/944
so cool
8:24 is that a flamethrower?
That was such a cool idea, definitely make more of these vids!!!!!!!ahhhhh!!!!! As long as it’s not me, I diagnose cars at a 3rd grade level.
That's awesome mad respect for the crew for this one! 👏🙌👌💯
Good on you guys for helping him along.  I'm absolutely hopeless so not whatsoever a candidate for this. one of those sabotages would probably take me an hour plus to figure out and fix.
If they took the car to Nissan they would have it a day or two until they fixed it
This was solid! defintley want to see more sub fix it vids.
I'd like to see uncle Tony on this show, just walking around with a bottle of gasoline, chain-smoking.
I’m excited for this new series
Oh come on, this is so not real world it isn’t even funny. If this was me and I got called to diagnose a car, the very FIRST thing I’d do is connect a scan tool. I’d have had this car diagnosed and running in less than 15 minutes. Scan data would have showed no crank RPM or fuel pressure
Lol I've always wanted to work on the car with the guys. Now that would be a dream come true
How does one get on this show?
man Zach really wants to jump in and help so bad, it's cool you guys are like that with everyone. solid crew
Ya'll should do a nice carbination 302 mustang from the 80's.
Shit dude 6m!
This caught me off guard this is really good
I cringed when he went under the car without jack stands!
I just wanna party with James.
Wow you guys are so cool and generous! Vinh the greatest mechanic of all time 💪✌️
Bet I will never get picked man if I only had a chance
This series has so much potential, and what a clever idea
Awesome video. I love the idea.
This series is awesome! I'd like to try my hand at it
🤙🏻🔰
I want to fix one ✋
Workin' for cars. It ain't much but it's honest work.
Freaking awesome video!
That guy got a new car and completely forgot his wife at the studio
Please chose me😂❤️!!
How did they find a working car to even buy 0.o  Amazing video though felt like glory days of Mythbusters on discovery haha
I'm a 23 year old master tech and I love the channel! Let me do this!!!
I like this idea, but I didn't like the assist at the end. Should've let him fail so I can be more excited for the next one
Yeah how about people from the other side of the world, let say slovenia, that could compete for the car, we do hope so, but we can only hope so
I’m glad you guys helped him out a bit. It was getting pretty painful watching him sweat it out. Great series, super entertaining!
This is such a great game show idea!! I never comment on videos but this actually is worth it. But if u wanna keep the car do a BMW LMAO
I love this series. This is such “feel-good” content in a genuine way.
🤚🏼 I volunteer as the first girl mechanic 😬
Go Vinh!
This is cool guys. Next time get a car that didn’t run when you got it, vice grip garage style.
This was sick, I actually learned something and I was hooked.
My favourite yet
You guys wanna let me on with my knowledge of cars only coming form youtube?
This was dope concept for a vid/car giveaway
It would be expensive but I love this idea for a series ❤
They chose the right one for the content. But the wrong one to fix it. My brother or I would have had a free 350z for sure.
This was brilliant! I know it's probably very expensive to give away cars but we need more of these lol 😁
Wong?
you should do it with brand new cars, it would be actually cheaper 😂
That’s ducking lit
I was stressed out cuz I hoped he’d win the car!
Lmao love the idea haven’t even seen video about too but love it. Give me one!!!! I’ll bring my tools lol
Man I feel like I've seen a video like this before.... Still love ya guys
Best channel ever
Y’all should of helped him push to start 🤦‍♂️ 😂
This is a great idea to make entertaining content & give away a car! Any tech would be very appreciative (plus we're usually pretty underpaid as it is 😂)
didn't samcrac do this a few months ago? XD
all the diesel guys: AIR, FUEL, AND HEAT!
Love this idea - that was awesome!
Eclipse GSX would need 24 hour's and a pack of NOS! Also STM on face time 😂
Yall really post things right after I do something similar lmfao. My crank position sensor just died on my 135i. And then back when the rb spun a bearing my n54 spun a bearing wth
Best channel on YT!!
this right here, my dear donuts, is it
ONE WORD: YUGO.
Helllyeah bro! Your hair looks fuckin sikkkk..
Jeremiah needs to calm down with the Shotgun gestors hahahahaha
Clutch pedal stopper? you mean some tape and a penny?
sign me up e36 edition🤣
you should get mr beast on this
Free knowledge acquired
He should have turned the key to hear of the pump was flowing. Though there was other stuff wrong.
Easy free car
wow
next time you guys do this. Any extra remaining time they have they should win money too. like $10-$20 for every extra minute they have after they get the car started.
Wanna do one with a 2008 350z😅😅
how can i put my boyfriend on this series he is phenomenal with cars👀
Im in need of a car. Please find me
This is great television. It’s like if pump my ride was a real show and didn’t suck.
this was insane 🔥
This is an awesome game! keep it up!
Dude this gave me anxiety. In a good way though.
You guys should get a 5-9 mustang gt and let me come over and fix it 😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎🥱😎😎😎😎😎😎😎
That's a really fucking clean 04. What a great car to win. What was the mileage if you read this?
Man it would be so sick to be able to do this, as somone who has rebuilt the vq35de i had so many possibilites going thru my head 😅 yall should definitely donthis again 10/10 🤙👍
I’m not a pro mechanic but I know I will win a free car if you guys give me a chance, doesn’t matter what car. Also love your videos, keep up the good work🤙🏽✊🏽
I love the fact that to win you need a bit of luck and a LOT of ability too!
Thank you for getting in to the grit of it all I've learned alot just from watching thank you I actually bought my 2006 mazda speed6 because of the videos your done on them
This is literally the best video i saw on YouTube.  It solves problems we all have. Thank u
Bad ass I want to try im in school for automotive services certification just to test what I've actually learned
This is literally my dream that i can't live
Ayo bro turn to Jesus Christ he loves all of us more than anything and he literally died for us. He took in the punishment for our sins thru suffering on the cross. It wasn’t cuz we deserved it, but cuz he loved us. 1 John 4:10 “This is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins” it was thru his love that he died for us and we can be forgiven
Nice
10/10 one of the best series y’all have made
Here's the petition to get chrisfix featured on an episode!
Make this dude cast dude hes amazing
If I was part of the donut Media :  I sabotage that Lamborghini Aventador if you fixed it you get it  (The ECU clean , a piston is messing, some fuel injectors messing, last time cracked up in the VW garage)  Good luck have fun
I love Donut.
Vinh was super relaxed, didn't even bother to rush.
I know what’s wrong with it, it ain’t got no gas innit
Do this again flipping sick.
Rsx or tsx
If you want to torture them, 300ZX Twin Turbo.
I probably would of failed this challenge lmao
Obviously this series is crazy expensive to produce but it’s by far one of my favorites. I fell outta donut for a little while but this was fantastic.
I thought about trading in my f150. Worth minimum 23k according to kbb for trade in in my condition. Autonation offered a measly 15k, and after to other dealers the most I got was 18k. Told them to go to hell after I saw the huge markup past kbb on all used cars on their lot. I'll just drive this till it dies at this point. Not worth it.
Hehe me next question mark not going to win but vacation question mark smile face
Man that was a lot of help he had
my mom's car stopped running right after I watched this 💀
Try me HAHAHA
Why isn't anybody commenting that Vinh is Nolan's Asian cousin??
90s honda civic si
He seemed like already part of the team
E36
This was awesome!!!! Awesome way to teach and give back to subscribers. Absolutely love it. BTW I would have totally failed. 🤣🤣
"I'm sure we got air... You know what just got ahead & take the day off."
Great show guys! Funny! Smart! Feel good stuff right here!
the way he inspects the car with the flashlight i just kept thinking   "he moans like a cop"
Whoever came up with this idea is a genius, I was sweating buckets the entire time
Was that Joshua Weissman in the thumbnail?
This is a cool ass series idea. You gotta do the Taco next.
Love it!! It's great to see all the hosts together. Defiantly need to do more of these kind of videos.
Imagine the car needed a whole engine replacement 🤣
This should be a full television series!!! It's educational, entertaining and unique. Car nuts would definitely tune in to watch this. I know for sure I would... But only if it was the Donut Team doing the show. Anyone else would probably screw this up.
This is better then the price is right...😃
This was really fun to watch.
Fox body mustang drift car!
Honestly I wouldn’t have been able to turn it on in 2 hours
I've never wanted another person to win something so badly lol
You guys should bring him back to continue doing challenges to upgrade his car.
I love you guys at Donut, you truly are an awesome group of awesome dudes
Assume = Ass out of U and Me
I wish i could join, but I'm not from the US. Hahaha
Oh no... sure would hate to be on this show... that would be the worst... 👀
No way I could have done that, awesome video!
Awesome concept for a show
I was screaming fuel pump for 5 minutes
Or maybe a eg civic
Oh pick me, pick me next! I installed a turbo on my FRS but I really don’t know diddly about cars. You’ll get more entertainment ($$$), AND get to keep the car to be reused in whatever way! Win/win, right??
You guys should do an sn95 mustang gt !!!
id be useless trying to fix anything mechanical lol, I can build a PC, but a car is a new world
This video is eerily ironic for me because I literally solved this EXACT puzzle about a month about ago in my '03 that has since been sold
Where can I sign up!
the crankshaft position sensor has done me dirty before. Glad he figured it out!
Guys this was an amazing episode. Justin keeping being donut guys. Keep being donut
Yo book time plus hour diag for all these fixes… sus
A great chance for the simple hard working man to fulfill his dream who might never have the money to fulfill his dream.
<3 <3 <3
This was a great vid. Congrats Vinh.
Do a steam engine car! That would discombobulate some poor soul😈🤣🤣
my dad fixes cars everyday i bet he could do this
Love this show
This was a really fun show! I hope you guys have more of these planned in the future. Congrats to Vinh!
That's cool
Hmmm turns out I know an 18 year old who is subscribed to Donut that still needs his first car, and knows how to fix them. That would happen to be me.
Awesome episode.....we want more!!!
OBD2 scanner will help.
Would love to see this for some young car enthusiasts who want to learn how to wrench on cars
Ooouuu I would love to try that
I love cars, but I know nothing about fixing them. My dumbass would be like " hmmmm.. its not starting. lets check if they removed the engine. "
Oh, the nerves!
I like this series. It like that it seems everyone is rooting for a win and it’s cool seeing someone use their skills to win a car.
I absolutely LOVE the fact that they helped him when he was in distress with little hints and the Hi Low video. They really wanted him to win and it was very wholesome. Awesome series! And damn that 350Z is so clean! Congrats!
Nice of you to give him the hint with the sensor. He was really close and I would have done the same.
Takes these mechanics 10 mins to fix something  Mechanics: "24 hours of labor pls"
What a content
It anit got no gas in it.
I just love how they wanted him to win more than he did :D
BRAND new 2004... .     its for sure had some service done so no mad at all
Where do i sign upp
W vid
Anything that has popup headlights
Man I was IN this, this was amazing. 86 Pontiac Fiero next
I wanna do this
Awesome show
A Jeep!
As someone who loves cars, but is not mechanically inclined at all. This would suck for me, they could tell me everything that was wrong and in 2 hours I wouldn't be able to fix it lol
Absolutely God tier content, much better then just giving a car away
I always love watching these videos they are always entertaining
I mean if you pick a tech with those boots of course he’s getting the cw
Give em a range rover or a Jag and 2 years to fix em
I'm sad today, so thank you for helping me laugh.
This is definitely a gameshow I would watch. GREAT idea!
we need more like this
I'd love to do this but I have like barely any mechanical experience when it comes to cars. I know the basics of spark plugs, tires, battery and oil changes but I wouldn't have a clue 😅
Boomer didn’t even offer him a hard lemonade ………. (James Is boomer)
Great episode, need this series.
What a awesome idea for a new show, I'd love a shot and diag a VW.
This is awesome I love this just wish one day I can come out and the can you fix it challenge
"can I download the FSM"
Correction Needs compression fuel spark
"Vinh - no relation to Mr. Diesel"
Lemme come fix a c5 corvette 😂
Dude that is actually really insane. Having only started with 2 hours.
they made him swap a fuel pump. that's tough. 😅
this show is lit!
Crank position sensor on the bellhousing huh
Great video. Enjoy watching.
Hell yeah!! I was rooting so hard for Vinh! Glad he won the car 😉🤘
Im sure i would of solved this no problem
Nice job Vinn!!
You guys cheated. Love the series. Next time let him 🔥. James to nice.
Shout out to helping him so much and making up random segments to help too
song in the outro?
if you have ever worked on a car before you know 2 hours is nothing. I probably spend 2 hours just researching the issue online before tackling any major repair. >.<
Hulk like show y'all are awesome
I can fix it.just not close to you.live in southern mn

Kinda sad he didn't scumbag burn out, out of the garage or driveway at the end there... missed opportunity... left me wanting...
Haha pit it in ultra nightmare mode and loosen up a connector pin
Enjoyed the hell out of this episode. Hope to see more of them.
I would never have been able to fix the car
Amazing video, I love it
this is way too intense
The air cleaner was a tricky move .if car dont start i usually go check the fuel pipe that goes to the injectors .then check the socket to the spark plug and to the injectors .
love these !
buy a 10th gen f150
Dope
New series idea, come to subscriber’s homes and finish their project cars..?
Click bait BULLSHIT
Time stranger gàget frutre car give me systems available anything back 2orld
*spoiler*          Genuinely happy for him, I'm glad he got the car in the end. Dude seemed like a genuine person I love the energy.
Datsun 280zx
I love the video! I was honestly thinking he was gonna walk away without the car but you guy's true good people and helped a guy out and for that, faith in humanity has been slightly restored. Props! 👏
Super wholesome lol, this series is awesome and has made me smile so much lol  Edit: you guys should do a Honda Civic of some sort, one with a K series or B series would be nice lol, maybe not next episode but eventually
Welcome to a day in my life. But Ford warranty only gives you 15 minutes to find the problem. Not 2 hours 🤣
I'm so happy for him.
This is going to help soooo many people.
I like the new segment guys keep it up the good work!
Unheard of in the world, beautiful
This is so Nice!! Not only for the Guy who won the car, but also because mechanics like us can learn from it how and what to diagnose ✌🏼
Soooooo he's gonna drive off with no tags lol????
More of these please!!!
Big fan of this idea, enjoyed that a lot. For the next car/ cars a mix of old school and new school. Show me the carbs! 🤪
I would have checked fuel after the clutch safety. A fast crank like that with no stutter is usually a fuel problem. Even with that air filter taped up the car would idle. Though it would probably die when you try to rev it. Why he didn't check the crank sensor right after bring it up surprises me.  I think you made it a little too easy for him, but I'm still happy he won that car. Man would I love to do that, and meet the crew. I'm not sure which I would like more. Everyone at Donut seems so hangout-able.
Mannnnn l would look like an idiot on this lol
Man, that was awesome. Yall are awesome for helping him out on that. I was sweating there for a second.
They gave this guy the car! I don't think he would have even went back to the sensor.  He did work hard tho and cool of donut media to give him the car but this is the thing. Winners that win deserve the trophy . Not get a trophy for participation
What about a scan tool?
one of the best  episodes so far
You should do this again for someone who desperately needs a car. Add more difficulty or remove difficulty as you see fit. I'd be willing to donate some money and I'm sure there enough people that would also.i know what it's like to not have a car and get to work
Remember when no one watched this channel and now they give away cars?🤔
This would be fun to watch them do with someone who was a complete novice
Go crazy and find an import right hand drive that's legal to own in the states a Silva any GTR series even some of the classic Datsuns
You should do an impala SS next
Probably Liz, my car is Christ the conquest with  a 2JZ GTE swap. I don't have a neutral safety switch it's an aftermarket fuel pump that makes hella nois when working . Lol
Damn I wish I was on this lol, I’ve worked on quite a few Nissan’s VQ37VHR and VQ35DE included
Hell Yes!!! Great job dude congrats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VDGysJGNoI
Finally!!!
Yooo! Hook me up! Lol good series. Good stuff. Gotta love it!
I love it donut mens
let people do a donut and they can get the car.
Ayo so how we get chosen? Ion know that much about fixing cars, but I know enough to get by😅
Next car idea: The answer is always what? Miata😂
Lolol break good parts and install Duralast junk in there. He’s going to be doing that whole job over again.
DONUT MEDIA WHAT IS THE WEB SITE OF CHEAP MUSCLE CARS VIDEO! i really need that
absolutely love this fucking channel, the best car content by a mile, also next do a Toyota Tacoma from the 2nd season of HiLow, it'll be lit
i would've missed the 1st one because not all manual car has that feature
family car next. suv maybe? got alot of families out here struggling, would love to see them get a helping hand.
He is a Vietnamese??
This kinda reminds me of a game show/pimp my ride mix, I dig it
ChrisFix needs apply for this series
Did he also won all the replacement parts inside the Bimmer's trunk? Because I think he deserves it, and also because it is a 350Z, he will definitely need them all.
I'm not sure I've seen a 350z that didn't at some point have a CPS problem.
I guess you could say Vinh's numbers came in
Imagine they just said...tnks for the fix we dident know what to do...and they just went away😂
This was such a fun video! Can't wait for more!
This should totally be a new show
i know whats wrong with it / it aint got no gas in it
I am from south Africa try me please
welp this setup is getting better and better! gj boys and girls!
So good!
vinh is vietnamese
This should be a serie called "You fix it you keep it"
Make my day with this LOL
Pick me I know nothing about cars so you might be able to keep it 🤣🤣🤣🤣
He should be part of the crew
13:33 caption typo
This episode was awesome.
Hahahha,  its remind me my highschool lesson,
Congrats to the winner
A bit intimidating with all the hosts there
they will never pick me
Holy crap that was a good video
Donut Media has some of the best contents out there. And also thanks for cleaning these bot mess.
They should bring on someone who hasn't worked with real cars, but has clocked a shit-ton of hours on Car Mechanic Simulator.
Do more of this
"are you just entertained or what?"
I’m a tire technician so if you wanted someone to be the first one on your show to not win the car I’m your guy
Do a BMW Z4. I bought a 2006 model and it's been the best experience. Everyone should drive a drop top at some point in their life. So Do a BMW Z4!
Great content guys. I love that you guys take every opportunity to inform and educate the viewer. Keep it up!
i know what's wrong wit it, it ain't got no gas in it
Ok hear me out hi lo lowriders???
Brand new 2004 350Z🤣🙄
Hotwire the starter , and the fuel pump if necessary . And just bypass all the stupid safety switches and such .
So Donut’s stealing ideas from mister cracc, huh?
Nice 👍
MAN I GOT GREEN HAIR IM LOUD IM CUTE IM FUNNY AND ILL GIVE JAMES A RUN FOR HIS MONEY PICK MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE NEXT
The 350z motor has 2 cam angle sensors
Yall made it on trending 😃
Lol that was what I said. Any Nissan/Infiniti no start usually is the cam/crank sensor.
next episode: get a full on amateur and just mess with the basic stuff
Enjoyed the challenge! It was great to watch fun and exciting!
yo, this episode kept me on edge!! I'm so happy he won!! this is why Donut is one of the top two best car channels the other one being @chrisfix, and NO #dougdemurodoesntcount since he's just a nerd who memorized car-related numbers.
That was cool 😎
congratulations to the winner
There's another crank sensor on the upper passenger side. I replaced both of them because a ticking noise however Ended up being a bad spark plug. Damm I would have won this car in 40 minutes
Chrisfix should do this
love these
I like this, absolutely fun to watch! Way to go guys! I've never rooted so hard for a total stranger before!
I wanna embarrass myself by attempting something like this. Im in pa, so you know that aint happening
Don’t know if this is new content you guys are doing or have already done before but it’s 🔥
At 1st I was sad this channel wasn’t about yummy pastries… but, now it’s one of my favorites
Vietnamese subscribers number after this 📈📈📈
🤔 interesting
No mechanic on earth works without Google, that's a fact ,unless u r working on same cars everyday u need new information all the time
Man I miss hi-low!!!
Hey I want to win that E36!
Congrats to Vinh
Thanks Donut.
EVERYONE says air, fuel, and spark. But everyone forgets about timing.... but been a tech for over 20 years and would crack under that pressure. Good job. OCD and hate being watched. I am the tech that doesn't let anyone borrow tools, but nice and spends more time helping than own work
He reminds me of Dennis from LTT. :)
This would be something fun to do even if you don’t win. I have one build in mind I hope will get me on bumper2bumper
The remaining minutes should become Dollars. Just saying.
i know what’s wrong with it, ain’t got no gas in it
What an absolutely fantastic episode. I love seeing stuff like this and evidence that further cements why do it is the best car channel on YouTube and even other platforms
Wow, that was next level informative!! I've been hacking on cars for years but now I really know what to look for 👌 thanks Donut!!
Isn't this are repost? He didn't get it runnin right?
I know what wrong with it! It ain't got no gas in it!
MAKE THIS A SERIES!!
God forbid you do one with Mitsubishi
Fk a fun vidéo and knowledge, love u guys❤️
Is this why you put out the we buy  junk cars shirt!  😆
I couldn’t have ever pulled that off😂
I'm liking these type of videos, keep them coming!
love that baby
great idea for a show!
H*ly s**t this is such a good segment.  This is gold.  Keep it up.  I’m not a mechanic but I would love to take on the challenge if the universe agrees.
😪
"we just bought this 2004 Nissan 350z" ooft, takes me back
Amazing and entertaining game.
Give my buddy and I a turbo Subaru 😏
This was such a cool video y’all , bravo 👏🏼
I'm very happy for this guy. I'd kill to win a mint 350z by fixing it!
I couldn't stop smiling... Man you guys are amazing
Let me get in here !!!
This is awesome make it a series!!!!
This is such a cool concept!!
This video may have saved me a bunch of money and time trying to start my shtbox!
The real problem is it's a DE 😅
Me watching this hoping I don’t get chosen because I would only know how to change the oil and fill up the gas…
Love how they helping their subscriber to fix the car 😄😄😄
I love the fact that nolan hasn't moved his project yet so they just make fun of it every video now
This was such a good video, I’m currently in school and I’m studying so I can become an automotive tech. Seeing a video like this is very informative and really helps you with working on diagnosing skills. Quick question guys. I brought an 08’ Audi A4 with the intention of fixing and flipping. It cranks but doesn’t start. Any pointers on directions I should take ? One thing I noticed is,  it doesn’t have a Check engine on light in the run position. So I’m thinking it’s an ecu issue, where the computer isn’t communicating with the sensors in the car. Any tips/pointers would be nice !!
There could be a tv show/competition like this. Fix on the run. Wohooo.
i would love to see chayo’s garage do this, he’s diagnosed many of european cars! great episode!
Bro I wanna learn how to fix 😭😭
This is a really fun show concept.
reasons i watch donut media yeeeeeee
I really hope this remains a thing this was soooo cool!!
Dude this is awesome! I love how they look like they genuinely want the guy to win!
This is the best car content 👍
those infographics actually help a lot lmao
Awesome!
More videos like this please, I HEAVILY depend on this for learning, more than you understand. Please more educational in depth content and diagrams and explanations for beginners. I don't always want silly ass inside car jokes only experienced car guys understand. Leave the silliness for Buzzfeed.
LOVE THIS NEW SHOW! Very entertaining AND educational. Props to Donut crew! ✌🏻
This is gold
Should totally do a sporty hatchback, maybe the Japanese vareity ;)
Yeahhh buddy
I've never been a car guy really, but absolutely love Donut videos and they make me semi into cars
U need mr.beast PACING OK then ur freinds needa be more engage AND MAKE THE SMART STUFF quick( wich yall did for the most part ) MORE CLICK BAIT AND FUN MUSIC AND ANIMATED IRL STUFF boom
Bru  did not just dip without a plate
What a fantastic idea!!
This was sick
Real Hero's journey here!
Wow! I wish I will be in one of the episode
Very cool idea for a video. 👍
Wow
I don’t usually leave a comment, but this videos was really entertaining.
Thank you Donut Media for pimping my ride.
This should be a whole series.
You need 4 things to run a gas engine. Air, Spark, Fuel, and COMPRESSION.
YOU NEED A TV DEAL NOW!!!!!!!
That was a GREAT show!
Next fix 350z for aftermarket parts!!
More!
i watch these videos because i have to fix my shitbox all the time lmao
damn son
SUCH AN AWESOME AND INSPIRATIONAL EPISODE
This would make a cool series, challenge mechanics to find and fix things in a certain time.
With a car I know, I could do this. But on a car I've never worked on before, two hours is pushing it. That was a decent amount of things wrong, and some cars really tuck away the parts you want to get to
Haha the pimp my ride outro 🤘😂
Best video by far loved the idea of it please keep it coming
Haha the pimp my ride outro 🤘😂
Ben watch y’all for couple of months now wanna be on y’all show next look like fun then aging I get flustered
I love this series
i wouldnt have been able to get it running good job man
👌🙂
Any cars for divorced dads of thr 3 most awesome daughters ever?  🙄 (Imagine puppydog eyes 👀)
I feel like this should be a new sires on speed network or whatever its called now called "can they fix it?" where you walk away with a free car but only if you find out what's wrong and try to fix it within the time limit.
Sweet vid boiiiiiiiiiiiiis
Multimeter is your best friend for diagnosing
This is your best show!!
Dude yes
This needs to be on major network tv…
I would of fail, I need google and YouTube and like a week to start it.
Love it :)
bro this is a great concept. hope you can make more!
Why am I so pumped for this dude to fix this car?!? More of this! As a kid growing up watching the Power Hour on Saturday mornings, I love shade tree mechanics putting in the reps to fix common problems on cars. FANTASTIC video!
Those sensors... always bricking cars on the freeway.
So how did the fuel pump start to get power after only cycling the key?🤔 And, crank positioning sensor is typically at the crank, who woulda thought😏
I love this video idea
Need to do more of these. Very entertaining
I want to do this!!
This video was dope af lol
This is probably the most brilliant series yet on automotive YouTube!
ME: Watching this guy fix five things in less than two hours.  Also Me: Watching my mechanic telling me that those spark plugs are specially made in Atlantis and will require a week to change each one.
Very cool series idea
I could not do this, I love cars, but I would’ve been a clueless idiot here with no car. But it sure was fun to watch, great new idea 😄😄
Sweet.
I love donut media
Jesus Christ is Lord he died for you and me, all we have to do is believe and get baptized in the name of Jesus. Then we are saved from the wrath God has coming toward this world. Confess your sins and that Jesus is your lord. Ask him to come into your heart and to be your savior. Love God with all your mind body and soul. And love your neighbor as yourself, be blessed brothers and sisters.
Please do more stuff on diesels. I’m new to the diesel world and I’m completely lost cause one symptom could be from 100 different things unlike a gas motor being fairly simple in diagnosing.
The quality of videos on donut media has significantly declined i respectfully don’t know if I’ll continue my subscription to this provider
The clutch safety switch was the FIRST thing I thought of lol
Video's like this are the reason I became a car mechanic. But after 3 years of being one at a Honda dealership. I just lost love for it. Flagging hours, crappy warranty work, and dealing with service advisors all day just makes you lose love for this industry. Hopefully I find another job that rekindles my love but for now. I want out and will just stick to work on my 03 mustang gt.
Give me a 94-01 Integra. I got a type r front for it already.
Love that y’all keep bringing the creativity to this channel!!
This is like a game show but better because I am actually interested in everything that is happening and I am learning more about fixing cars
1st or 2nd gen Rx-7 ,make them change the apex seals
Too easy, if a car won't start go down the checklist:   1. Fuel 2. Air 3. Spark  You'll eventually find the reason it won't turn over.  Edit:  almost forgot   4. Neutral safety switch (manuals)  Commented this before seeing if it's a stick but considering it's a 350z you'll definitely wanna check that as well.  Some people disable them (I always did) but also need to check that bad boy on the row-y boys.  Edit 2: lol 3 minutes in and they literally say this exact thing.  That's what I get for commenting before the video.  I gotta be honest though I was a mechanic in a past life so that's how my brain works.
So cool to have that you guys give other people that opportunity m.
VW GTI
More of these please
Your boy in KY needs that KY cobra hat, James make it happen
Love these videos. Need more!
I'm liking this new series! Hope to see more!
Give her the beans!  Do a  Taco!
To be fair, wrong guessing the fuel pump saved him in the long run....brand new saved him $500 or so (mine is $500 brand new) parts stores can suck my a-
This may have replace the d list as the best show on donut media I need more of these and quickly
Very cool! Father of 5 here so if you ever have a suburban that needs fixin I’d love to give it a swing:)
Where did you find the car? @DonutMedia
Wow that was so unsatisfying due to the fact that all that noise blocked out the sound of the engine firing up. At first I gave this video a thumbs up but now I’m disliking it. And I’m dead ass serious. Congratulations fuckbois!
I was worried that duralast cps wasn't going to work ..
I would like to see this with an old car with a carburetor and very little electrical
such a cool series one day i hope to do something like this on youtube
Donut Media saved my life, tell a friend to tell a friend!
Inspired by High/Low, I bought a project 350z for $3500. 214k miles, a lot of rust, many replaced bolts, and not a regret in the world
How do i get in one of these?
Yeah Vinh!!!
awesome video!!
I think this series is hokey and dosnt actually represent the problems you would encounter with a car. Kudos on keeping it interesting but it dosnt do it for me,
Much love to y’all Donuts out there!
Fire
That was cool! How about a Rotary Engine Car?!
😁👍✌
Awesome series idea!
i would love to be ur next person as i am in need of a car bad as my last one just crapped the bed on me last month and i dont have the money to spend on a car . ps im a bug fan of the 08 to 2010 subaru impreza wagons lol manuels lol
My ONLY critique is that at no point did I think he wasn’t going to get the car. There are really no stakes here. The time limit is only a prop. This is a give away masquerading as a game show. Which is fine I guess.
Cool new show! I fuck wit it.
This episode felt so much more stressful than the integra
did you guys make a pact with the devil for show ideas? 0.o
This series is good because they want him to win the car. They’re all rooting for him, and doing just enough to make sure the car goes home with the challenger, while remaining a challenger
LoL Mo Powa BaBy!!
Haha accompanied by his wife to believe he won a car
Im 16 and just got my drivers license, don’t have a car and don’t have any clue how to work on them, but if you need somebody for a vid I’d be more than glad to be a part :) Also my favorite car is Chrysler 300
I miss my 350z sometimes wasn’t fast but the car was definitely fun.
Muscles Glasses' looking alright at 14:30
The best donut video yet.   Insane idea.    Really good content
That was one of my favorite episodes. I know more of these episodes would be expensive but I love the content!
I love this idea!  Although if I were picked it would go more like "Hmm, yes this car definitely doesn't start." *kicks tires*
Really enjoyed this one good job guys
Ever thought about doing this challenge for an electric car?  One day we'll tell our grandchildren about how cars used to be gas powered and they'll teach us like we did for ours with smart phones
Lol "Brand New 2004 car"!
Is this like Pimp My Ride and you end up ripping him off?
My dream
You guys have watched way to many 'reality' TV shows.....!
This might be the coolest video in Donut history. Not just because a lucky fan gets to hang out with them and work on fixing a cool car, but for the team helping this fan potentially take the car home. It's a really creative and entertaining way to give back to your fans. I'd love to see more of this!
Whoever y'all hired to do music has been doing a great job! The silly songs on diy or don't and then the shire reference as James mentioned Mordor, spot on
As soon as it starts he whips out his phone and all you here is "chris fix here"
It’s awesome that y’all actually want him to win
Holyshit guys!!! This is the best show on YouTube.  More, more, more, MORE!!!!
Hell yes, I love this idea. I wouldn't stand a chance in a competition like this but I was rooting for Vinh!
this should actually be real tv show with actual prize money for avg mechanics. so cool
Definitely an awesome series guys!
Literally great idea for a video! Genius
I got a $400 honda prelude w 36kmiles on it.
I'm HOOKED. I need my fix.... Where's the next episode??!!!???!!!??!!?!?
Brand new 2004
I love donut media dude, gonna buy a hoodie eventually
funny cause the shop always wanna charge me like 6 hours for an oil change this guy found 4 problems and installed new parts in under 2 without a scan tool or nissan consult program
U dont ever wanna access the fuel pump on a 350z them bitches is hidden
Should totally do this with like an old school dinosaur diesel(12 valve or 7.3 powerstroke), if you need help with the sabotage hit me up lol
"worked fine but we sabotaged it" NOW YOU'RE THINKING LIKE GENERAL MOTORS
You guys should def get Chrisfix sometime, that would be interesting to watch imo lmao
You should get somebody that knows nothing about cars to try this.
15:28 "Thank you MTV for pimpin' my ride!"
Lov it
I would have lost. I don't know much about manuals.
This is my new favorite concept Donut's done.
You should do this to test the mechanic youtuber's Like Vice Grip or JYD instead of your subscribers
That HiLow hint really shows how donut cares about its subscribers
Do a Jeep but mangle it first
BRZ!!!!!!  Amazing videos!
I want a car
Great episode!  Definitely should have more of these.  Like a monthly or quarterly episode.
what would take to just meet the crew like i dont have the knowledge to do these episodes but i just want to come by and say hello to everyone and maybe hang out with yall
dope
damn i coulda figured that out too and im a retard.. nah jk i had to fix all those things alll ready on my Z lol
Nice. Made me happy made me smile nice.
This was awesome and entertaining 💪👏
I think handing it to him at the end was a bit of a bummer, but then again not being familiar with the car makes it very easy to misidentify parts
Man you guys had my anxiety through the roof just watching this. I turn a lot of wrenches but there's no way I'd survive your challenge. That's an amazing car to win though, I love the 350z
That song that starts at 10:57 all I could think about was Viva La Dirt League. 🤣
careful, Jerry, the spark is not a catalyst per se in the cycle 😬
Thank you for getting me into cars, Donut. You guys have really brought the inner car guy out of me and now it’s one of my great hobbies!
I love this so much
ugh is starting fluid not an option?..............
Y'all missed a component for an engine to run. Compression. You CANNOT have the proper or any "explosion" inside the cylinder walls without compression.
I want to see harder problems do stuff like cut connector pins out of sensors. Put debris on a maf sensors so it doesn’t read air flow. Make air leaks so when the car does start it runs awful like a lean mixture. Or replace the the transponder key with a fake so it has a immobilizer fault and won’t allow the car to run. Remove CAN bus lines for the engine control unit so you have no communication on the engine CAN. Disassemble a starter and gut the bendix so it spins but doesn’t throw it out. (If it’s easy to get to) You can also which is dirty if you buy a pin removal to take the power wire to the ecu and pull it back so it doesn’t make contact in the connector and put the wire sheathing back like you weren’t there.
Oh wow he got the car! Nice! I want next!
next time this happens you should load the interior with a bomb that'll go off 45 minutes after the start
Man James is such a great video producer. And it was so cute seeing the guy's pregnant wife be his soundboard as he thought about it
My grandfather worked for nissan and he got sent out to Toronto for training and they did similar things to test there techs.
N54  you can get more than one body and have two people work on the same issue one being on a sedan/coupe one being SUV  There are so many simple things to fuck up on an N54 it should be the logo for this show.
Everytime I buy a car I give the 60min or less guarantee and I buy alot of cars 20 last year😂. I Usually have em started before I pull em off the trailer . Lemme get a shot at this 👀👀
Day 183:Of Asking Donut Media to Build a Ford Thunder (you can call it the Ford Lightning Lightning if you want
But you definitely have to take it back if he puts a Tomei exhaust on it. Just saying
I'd smash that record...if it were a rotary HA
i would love the challenge! this sounds awesome!
Fix my 1992 Lexus sc400 I can donate it to you guys please
And as always.. we love you
good stuff
awesome video cant wait fro the next one
thats a lucky guy!
I literally jumped out of my seat in excitement when the car started
Please keep doing this series🙏🙏
I would love to try that
FKN LOVE THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!
If it was me I would have spent the whole time at the little tab under the dash 😅
Wow. Vin is Mad intelligent in the Mechanical field. 🤯
Awesome video idea for sure! Also a cool experience for whoever gets to do it wether they get the car or not. Super dope he got it!!
So damn jealous, wish my Z was free haha. Had to do many of these fixes already
So basically wordle for car guys.
I’d love to play for a s14!🙏🏽
https://youtu.be/KSlLESv3qs4
Great now he owes 2 types of tax on that new car (registration and prize/ gift tax).   Really though I'd love to just win a car 🤣
350z looks absolotly awsom
the way that this is a parody of a 2000s-style reality tv contest show, but is actually exciting to watch is a testament to donuts team
Hello from Canada, I just want to say hi and I love this video. Dude man came in blind, got the car running and now he has a great ride. Props to to Vinh for getting it to run and to Donut for being awesome.
Sorry but y does the rally car look to good lowered
This is genius!!
He won the car and left without his girl 🤣
He got tricked but he came back, like a true hero
That 350 is  🔥
That’s cool.  I’d screw it up though.  I can work suspension and brakes, but that’s about it.
I used to own a 350z and these problems would have taken me hours on the forums and rock auto to figure this out. That on top of hours outside sweaty, dirty, cussing, panicking, wondering if I messed things up more, and wondering if I should just pay to have it towed to the mechanic.
BMW e46
Sick Idea bro
Even they don’t have YouTube premium lol
im down, ill get swweaty tho
For some reason I didn't think I'd like this video.... But its Donut Media... I love every video lol
I would have nailed all this EXCEPT the neutral switch, I would never have gotten that in a million years
VINH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
How can I enter.
IMO this is the greatest video you guys have made. Congrats guys 🔥
you guys should do an up to speed on can-am, or polaris.
How do u do if someone lives in sweden, do u take the car over here 😅
“We’ll just be right here.” No big deal
this is one of best ideas on this channel since awhile... the combination of the educational info, and the tried and true game show / reality TV formula
If you wanna give me a car and parts.... I'll definetly do it
Code reader?
Send this to  chrisfix
could he not use a obd scan tool?
So I love the video guys it was awesome as always. Although y’all’s car parts ad came in so clutch I couldn’t find my part cause national backorder and I’m finally going to have her running this week. Honesty just kind of said well what’s the worst that can happen they just won’t have it like everyone else but nope I’m so excited. Y’all are awesome guys all the way around!
You guys gotta put ChrisFix to the test
Dude is it just me or is the donut crew like a group of the most handsomest guys ever
That was awesome
this was awesome dude!!!
Awesome!
How do you feel about your new used 2004 nissan 350z!?  This looks fun!
Loved doing this sort of thing in my automotive class. Teacher would unplug some sneaky stuff and have us all figure it out. Super fun. Great series fellas.
Its like what canada did to truckers equipment, except you guys gave the parts back!
I like that idea giveaway that you actually have to put work into awesome video guys thank you
Clutch safety switches are a bummer. Mines bypassed so when my pos dies i can safely use the starter to pull out of the road 😁😁
i love this series so much. i hope we never see someone lose on it
He has some time left, I would have used them to ask for more gas after the car started. If they asked why, been like have you seen has prices.
Great new series keep them coming !!
Wow the content we never knew we needed. Make this a series 🙏
I wished I could do this until I realized that I’m a dumbass :,)
You better put a Nissan CKP sensor if you don't want problems
This is a DOPE VIDEO
Lmao the best part was when he clapped back at Jimmy 😆 13:05
This must be named " FIX IT, KEEP IT"
I could do this with a carburetor quad but that's really it
this needs to be on national TV
We had a competition in high school like this with #FordAAA
I would have looked at the manual
this could easly be a series or even a tv show!!! please make more videos like this
Broo this is the best reality EVER!!!
Better be a new series! Hopefully the cost of making the video vs. the profit is worth doing it monthly or something.
Lol making the rules up as you go eh?
Oh my god
Thanks for choosing me. 🙄
sick moves bro😚
and after he keeps it, he can start paying expensive insurance, gas and then pay the taxes on it which are probably more than what I make in a year.
This guy is an actual mechanic. Offer him a spot on the crew.
Autoshop- thatll be $2k
the switch would of been nice when I first got my car
Hell yeah!!!!
I love this segment, he jumped to Google way too quickly, every car has a manual inside the glove box...
"Free?" Sweet  *immediately ls swaps it*
I love the idea and after the 3th episode out ill challenge you guys 😈😁😇
Congrats on making the top 10 on trending! I hope my channel gets there one day!
It was so awesome when u hinted and also let him watch an episode , good job , keep it up ❤️
I want a MK three supra….
Still waiting when I can RSVP to the next tool party. Party🥳
He definitely got down in Mordor
He did a great job he defiatly deserved it ! Hand 👏
Really enjoyed this. Can't wait to see the next sabotaged ride.
Yo this made my Sunday. This is so awesome for the company and the on camera personalities to so encouraging. Nice way to engage the community. Awesome all around.
this was entertaining
Thank you guys for making someone’s day! You all are awesome!
I'd love to try this it looks real fun. I've always thought there should be some kind of mechanic Olympics.
🤘🤘🤘🤘
Yo, I would come try this anytime fellas! Really though like ANY TIME!
I love James
Was there a rule not to allow a SCAN TOOL?  All 3 could have been figured kinda quickly.
That was an extremely generous help!
Very creative
13:07 Every time they say it only takes 3 things to start, i can hear my small engine repair mentor yelling "Fucking compression too". It's like people forgetting plasma is the 4th state of matter.
This is dope!!! Hearts of gold, God bless you all for all you do. Keep up the best work!!!
Let's Go donut media with another great idea and it comes with knowledge I love learning about cars everytime I watch a donut video
i know what’s wrong wit it, ain’t got no gas innit
He totally earned it. The sensor is impossible to diagnose without a scan tool. // Next time make it harder but got to allow tool.
That was such a feel good vid. Wow he was super lucky to be selected not to mention smart &  c a l m  enough to get it fired (with a Lil help) I woulda been flippin out n dancing like I won BOTH showcases from Drew!!! My man Vin seems like a chill dude so Congrats to him 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾!! How do I throw my hat in, this would be so much fun to do✌
Review Citroen Survolt, I'm just curious about this car and car company.
This makes me happy
I'm glad y'all helped him! I wanna see everyone on this show win!
Would love to be a part of some of your videos but sadly I dont live in United States ):
I kinda want to be in that kind of episodes anc try to win a rx7
AWESOME WIN!!  keep checking that dipstick, old VQ35's consume lots of oil. with that being said I gotta check the oil in  my Maxima (02, first year VQ35DE @ 319,XXX miles)
Is that vinh that works at precision auto?
Congrats, Vinh!! Great diagnosis technique.
Great idea for a show
Man I wish I could score a 350z for free!    But instead I scored a 2003 350z track for 700 usd.  (And a Ka24de trade from a 96 240sx.)
I’m pretty sure this is the most entertaining thing on YouTube. Relatable, exciting and well done! Always love donut videos!
Where was I when y'all wanted to do this vid
need to do a lot more of these, these are real fun to watch, I always loved game shows!!
Women's. Shirts. Pleeeeeeeeeeeease
New series?
@Donut Media :  Love this!!!
20 mins for a fuel pump is extremely ambitious
Samcrac had a video like this maybe a month or two ago. You guys use the idea maybe lol?? Anyways cool series idea.
This is a cool concept. I'm a mechanic so if I couldnt get it running in 2 hrs I'd be out of a yob.
Great idea for a show!
Hey guys I’m in upstate New York if y’all would like to let me work on one :)
Donut media give me a chance at this I’m 17 and I think I’m up for the challenge
Is that a diamond "ring" tattoo on that finger?
What’s up brothers I would love to be on the show and win a car Will be great Like frosted flakes
WRX
You guys could have played him so dirty by  copying a new key without programming the nats...
I honestly love these.  Its honestly like a little bit of every one of there shows, minus the history on the individual models.
So, he doesn't have 2 hours? This is fuckin stupid!
Damn I wish I got picked for these videos I need a car to get to work
This was great. And a nice idea. I love the whole camaraderie with this whole crew, seems like a really friendly and welcoming environment. 👍 good job, Vinh, congrats on the new car!
I want to try this so bad
How about give the people the car if You can fix it fake ass shit smh.
Wohoooo
This series shows the difference between a mechanic, and a technician.
Schweeeet.
Great gameshow.
You all are an awesome team with sone amazing content!!! My wife and I want to learn how to work on cars so I'll show her this and we'll continue to follow you all. It is refreshing to see a game show for car enthusiasts as it's a great idea concept!!!
How to prove this free car goes to a good home, have them fix it first. I love the idea
I’d be happy af to get a free a with prices now
yaknow what, this is actually a great idea. keep at it
I've had to replace the little plastic piece for pushing the neutral safety switch. I was stuck in Walmart parking lot when it broke and fell out. Ended up taping a penny in its place to get the car drivable and headed to the dealer to buy a $3 piece of plastic.   Guy knows what he's doing. I'm glad he won.
as always, so good.
I want a car but I live in Niagara falls
I want a 350z!
i wish i had a chance like this, i may be 14, but i have fixed and built my fair share of cars, ranging from a 74 c30 all the way up to a 2017 ford explorer, and even got to work on a 68 Vette
Not gonna lie this guy did really good
Need me to replace a c6 battery let me know 🤝
thanks for making the z market go up even higher!
Hi donut on trending
Love this. Keep up the good work!
Man I wish I could be apart of it but I’m not the greatest on car fixing knowledge. Like I say I’m way more than noob but way less than pro.
Great content gentlemen!! Keep innovating!!!!
This is the best new content Donut Media could do
Love this shit so much
Can you guys come to Michigan this year and host an event or something like this? Please
The absolute best series 👏🏽
He earned that car. Great video!
You should make it so guys who don’t know mechanic work can do it too! I would have failed even if I had 2 days and google lol
I want a 350z so bad
Very cool concept you guys !! Tough challenge too
I love how they make fixing cars seem so easy. Then I'm over here exhausted just replacing a brake light.
STI next
Speedrun series?
We all assume Mr. Diesel’s first name is Vincent, but what if it’s Marvin…
Well, only I can say is, sana all may bagong kotse
I want to see you fly scotty kilmer in and see if he can beat this
They hit me up to fix a car ide lose so fkn bad lol unless they give me a car with a flat I can fix that lol
I love how you guys edit your videos ❤️😌👌
You guys are awesome 😎
A nice car i maybe want to buy  but 5k plus taxes here to drive this car on the road in Belgium 🥺. Maybe i wait until new civic type r then :p gonna cost way more to buy but probably cheaper in taxes.
Might have to go back and rewatch alot of the DIY vids, lol
I would definitely not be able to start that car, the cars that I'm used to work on are carbureted with manual fuel pump and no sensors.
one of the only car entertainment resources that actually posts useful information too! i've learned so much about how cars work from your videos, to the point where i've managed to impress my uncle who was an RAF engineer. Thanks a lot guys
Nice 🎥🎬  , Classic car maybe ?
I love this series
Damn this is easily my favorite series in the channel Keep it up boys !
if you do one with an AE86, ill fix it in 1 hour!
lol if they get me a flying ticket from germany to them i would try xd
This new series is awesome, love it!
Great idea for a show, i been watching since the the beginning of the channel n love the content, keep up the good work.
Love this show cus the people have to really earn it with their knowledge and skills they’ve gained from loving cars and being a car enthusiast.
This is awesome guys. I love that giving away a 17 year old car is still exciting, if not more exciting, than the bougie giveaways for nothing that some channels do. “Hey, just make it work and we’ll let you have it,” is way better than “YOU WIN!”
Revelations 3:19 “As many as I love, I rebuke and discipline. So be zealous and repent.” ‭‭Revelation‬ ‭3:19‬ ‭CSB‬‬.
Dude is smart
I love you guys 😂
Respect it!
This is literally my dream car… wish i had the opportunity to do this
Such a good idea yall! And I love your guy's enthusiasm 🤘🏻👍🏻💯
I'd love to compete
Great to see my boys on trending 🗿
A very easy way to diagnose crank pos. Sensor is while youre trying to start you wont see your RPMs raise. Not sure if this applies to every brand/ year but just on possible indicator
Bruh I swear that neutral safety switch would got me 🤣 total forgot that existed was bypassed on my old manual truck
The Squidward Apparition 2-https://youtu.be/eZ3vj_gKZ3Q
Nice new segment. 👌  looking forward to more of these!
This is like what Pimp My Ride should’ve been
This is a great show idea
What's the ChrisFix time penalty?
Love this series!
WISH I COULD TAKE ON THAT CHALLENGE
Moral of the story… Not only to VQ owners but to anyone with a vehicle. Please buy an OBD2 Scanner lmao. I know too many VQ owners constantly asking what’s wrong with their car and why it has a CEL… Come to find out they haven’t even checked for the code at all.
You can pick this subscriber for the next give away. Maybe you want to give away a 2000 Trans am?
This would make a great game show
S13 and I'm in
Wholly crap, I seriously thought Zach was Jeremiah this whole damn time but just grew out his hair and facial hair..... They're actually two different person 🤣🤣🤣😂😂
Max, nice use of the Morrowind hit sfx
Hey @Donutmedia do you ship your merchandise Internationally?
Now I know how to fix my car thank you
Brand new 2004 350z😂🤣
That guy is badass. I don't think id be able to change a tire safely with that many people watching knowing cameras are rolling too lmao.   Good work!
This series is a total homerun. Yall really need to double down on this. Also endless opportunities for different types of vehicles. Would love to see this with over engineered exotics, old school carburetor muscle cars, hybrids? Lots of opportunity for great content here.
Awesome episode, I love the creativity of the   issues thrown at him. Very good episode indeed.
What a freakin good video again. I was definitely stressed that he would miss the crank sensor. Not the type of video to watch before going to bed ahah Thanks donut to give some amazing content and a great car for a subscriber ❤️
This is an AWESOME series! Keep it around!
O yea I love this challenge or this type of video
give vihn a job at donut next
You guys really hit the nail on the head with this one, this series is a great learning tool with almost and endless list of things you can make videos on
It ain't a Donut Media video without a clip of someone completely botching some mental math on camera. Sorry Jobe
You know what would be hilarious. If he fixed all the sabotage and it still didn't start and James was just like oh s**t 🤣
This was really an amazing vid, learnt a lot. Do more of these!
I think he forgot his Mrs on the way out 😂 maybe he made an exchange!
Hi
Bruh this episode had me on the edge of my seat! I'm so glad the bro got it
that was cool
Y’all should come to ri for this
This was absolutely great.  I'm not sure how you follow this up but I'd love a series of these.
Man that was great
I got a fun one. Buy an out of warranty electric car and see if they can fix that.
Broooo Mr beast ain't got nothing on yoooooooouuuuu
What a wild episode! Great work! I’d get behind a television series made by you guys.
i got my engineering degree wt donut...
Dude I wish, 350 Z’s be going uphill in price 😖
I like how Nolan has seen the Z turbo kit video 5 times. He just wants to re-live the pain 😂
How's the fit on the shirts? Tru to size?
Pick me. Pick me. . . I'll fly out. Loving everything Donut has to offer.
Nailed it 👌
No free exhaust or parts to take off time?
Great video ive always wanted to see  giveaways like this
I want a Z so badly 😩
James be beefin up a bit
Sign me up, as a veteran flat rate tech I’ve never been so prepared for a challenge in my life lol
Can I email you guys? I have a super awesome idea for your channel and I want to share it with you. Honestly anyway of contact, which ever works for you bros. Take care guys, I hope I can hear from you guys soon.
This is great. I really enjoyed this series
I was so glad and nervus he wasint gonna win the car
I love how they went to orielly’s and autozone to get parts. Showing they don’t have any bias !
I own a mechanic shop! Choose me to fix a car!
Love this show, best show after hi low... you guys rock!!
I've understood how cars work for a while, but this kind of troubleshooting content really helps me understand repair a lot more.
I love this series, i hope you all do more stuff like this in the future. Even if in another series you don't give a car away, it's really cool to see you guys fixing cars like this. It teaches us a lot.
I need more jeep slander on my Instagram feed
Top of the line info-tainment!
Way to go Vinh!!!!!
Great idea for a show guys!!!!!!
the way Zack looks at Vin at 12:57 got me wheezing
YOU KNOW WHATS CRAZY MY 350z’s clutch button stopper thingy broke and it took me 1 long afternoon to figure it out lmao
Would love to see one of these videos but with someone who has little experience working on cars. For example the biggest change I’ve ever done was an exhaust and an alternator.
Love that y’all clearly wanted him to win the car
He was to calm. I would be hustling around that car!
You guys are awesome:)
Damn that's like a $230,000 car right now! Donut wildin'
I wish I could win one, but I know I wouldn't 🤣🤣 I don't know "nothing", but I don't know enough
well done binh
As someone who knows a little but still nothing about cars, this is so fascinating to me. Love the vid
FUCKING BOUT TIME YOU GUYS MADE ANOTHER EPISODE!
How do I participate in this challenge on the east coast?
I need to be on this show as a first year automotive student who is looking for a project car
Genius idea for a series can’t wait for more of this
This is amazing content.  Thanks guys!
I like it but it kinda ruins the suspense if you help so much. Obviously you want to give the car away which is cool so maybe instead what you do is bring 3 people in, don't help them at all, and fastest wins. That way you involve more of the community, give the car away, create more content, and it keeps the element of suspense.
This is sweet
Such a cool concept!!!!
That Z is mint. Don't see them like that anymore.
Impressed…figuring out these “minor” issues would have taken me a few days.
How do you apply to get selected for one of these episodes? I don’t wanna apply, I’m not a doctor, but I have a friend who has fixed every mechanical problem of mine for years and I’d love to see him on the show.
I rooted for this dude for a whole 15 minutes
mrbeast for cars
I think that crank position sensor would had got me also
I would love this to be a new thing
Congratulations Vin 🎉
Y’all are TOO nice this could have turned into a neat little 2/3 episodes lol congrats bro on the car though
I really like this, because it's giving general ideas for troubleshooting a car. Like I love working on my own cars, and I would only consider myself an enthusiast, but not ultra knowledgeable because I only encounter the problems that my cars develop. Loved this one!
this is actually original content(at least i have not seen it before); Pretty good folks.
Even the youtube creators know paying for it is dumb.
he sucked lol he would have never won
vinh should have watch the vid in a faster playback for a timesave as long as James didn’t deduct time for that
This was awesome!!
This was awesome, so happy for him. What a beautiful Z!
I would not win a car in this contest lol
What a cool episode guys!!!
The clutch safety switch has caught me off guard before having only had shitboxes with no safety switch lmao
This was great!! Run with it.
“A donut video may have saved someone’s life“ lmao
I'm going to try this with an $800 Corolla  Not fast but fun
Good man. Good car. Good content. Reasons behind why I'm a subscriber here
If I could get my first car by meeting the donut crew and fixing a car to earn it I think be happy even to lose just to fix a car.
He looks like Nolan😅
Is this Staged?
I already have an 07 HR but another 350Z wouldn’t hurt
Great idea for a series ☺️😊
Golf r or focus rs. Even better would be zachs miata
Would love to try it too but I guess it would be a problem that I'm a teenager and I live in germany:(
This guy's awesome!
Me next.
Need to offer them the Aftermarket parts challenge.
Love this show
Got the jitters as soon as I heard the theme song for hi-low
Cheaters
13:22 Wait would you have executed him if he didnt succed
That's cool that he drove off 15:28 without that pregnant lady he was with 7:04
Epic!  Next car let’s go classic JDM or American muscle… either would be interesting
This is a must keep series!
I woulda just soaked the whole thing in starting fluid.
Oh I wish i could do this one My dream car is a 350z
what a great idea, love this!
This is beautiful
I wanna do this😳
That was so fun! Thank you Donut media!!
This is awesome! I’m glad he won! Beautiful Z!
Great episode lol also hire that guy😂 could have a show all for him lol
Do an e38. They will never figure it out lol
Man I love this series it's really fun lmao
He damn near wanted to cry lmao
Excellent, original idea for content!!! 👌
Dude, this is badass. Reminds me of Junkyard Wars! Love the material. -fam
Man I wish I need an actual good project car for once
This is so dope. The mans looks so stoked
This is bloody brilliant!!
OMG I WOILD KILL FOR THAT Z
free 350z for a huge amount of stress...im in baby
This was awesome!!
Pretty cool to see these guys fix the cars. They have a lot of knowledge to figure all this out pretty impressive. Glad the guy won good for him. Very cool game show. Would be rad to see a motorcycle episode
Make it a series with various issues and different types of vehicles
This is the gameshow car guys always wanted.  Genius
Vinh is dope
I was on the edge of my seat. So good!
i love this
Automatic cars also have a brake safety switch will only let you start the car if the brake switch is correct that took me a long ass time to figure out one time with my IS350
That was a fun video. 🤙
Ya'll helped him a bunch
My tactic would be look for what has been touched recently
I wish I could get help fixing my 1998 eclipse with a engine swap lol
Love this series
Use a BMW to make this challenge unbeatable
Lessss gooooo‼️
This is an amazing idea. Love it guys
12:57 Should have put it on double speed to not waste time, uh huh xD
i would cry if i won a car even tho i know so little about them
this crew is so entertaining. You guys are amazing at what you do on here
I just love how all of y’all come together and do these amazing things and have fun with it
anyone wanna buy a 2012 Audi A6 3.0T? 98k miles. 14k cash or <100k mile is250 only. Rims are jank but hold air. needs nuthin.
Dude I want to be put in a position like this, im tired of working at midas
Congrats for the new car bro!
Hey Donut I think I'd really like to see this series done with people who don't really wrench on their car. Maybe find a subscriber that more or less knows how cars work but hasn't wrenched on their car before.
Had the same problem with my crank position sensor on my z
Niceeeeeeee!
I love how you all make content that is relatable to ALL levels who are interested in cars! Great content.
James' microphone adds so much pressure
Choose me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I wish you would Donut Media... try me
What's the name of the outro song?
Can you come to Brasil? I'm in need of a new car! 😬
This is just great !
Bru that was EPIC I LOVE IT!!!
That's awesome. I never win anything.
I've been a garage manager for 10 years and a mechanic forever; that would have been a nightmare to diagnose. How many times does a car have no air, spark or gas? The first thing I would have thought was the car was in safe mode for some reason.
That was so cool. Nice guys
Golf GTI
Oooof, I got a little PTSD when he initially missed the crank sensor 😬
You guys are brilliant. This series a very entertaining idea. Can’t wait for the next one.
You guys are genuinely good people, thanks for the videos and thanks for helping out us fans. Great video boys
Really cool contest. Keep it up 🍩
it looked like you guys went to town with a band saw on the Crank Sensor lol genius!!!
You know these are just excuses to give cars to good people cause bruh. They let him scrub through a YouTube vid no penalty.
Dope af
Couldn't he use a scan tool, scan the car and find out all what's wrong with it? Just saying...
Great content!
What an awesome episode!
I heard it’s up for sale for $15k on Facebook bc it was on this episode!
I could do this but it would take me 2 days, not 2 hours! And a whole lot of Google…
You should use the same type of vehicles you feature in the donut series, like the Toyota taco!
I hope the title is in the car when he drove off. Wouldn't want him pulled over at the next block lol
This was definitely the most stressful episode lmao
As a 350Z owner myself, this is painful watching him move around and not know how to find things on it.  But I’ve been an owner of one for years and have had time to find and get to know it well.
reminds me of the auto shop class diagnose competitions back in the day.
Go ahead and make a million more of these.
All of this power has turned James into a monster 👹 … 🤣
This is so good
yayy!!
Man I never would have thought about the clutch safety switch and that guy got it immediately lol. To be fair, I imagine that's not something that breaks very often, and probably isn't a normal troubleshooting step
Awesome show! What a great idea!
kinda gave away too many hints
Imagine if you were working on your dream car but you ran out of time😂
Donut on a Sunday? Yes please
Only 8 mins in and I’m already feeling anxious! Great job guys!! Great idea!!
Awesome episode. Cool idea. Great work guys love the content
Can anyone give me a hint on why my 350z is throwing out a bunch of white smoke? Like from the exhaust and the air vents? I thought I would ask on here and not go to a mechanic before they over charge me for something I don't know 😕
You guys should continue these series btw this was AWESOME 👏
Love this challenge!
More of this. More of this. But y'all should start making the cars a bit more expensive (within your budget of course) and giving the contenders like phone a friend, 1 google search, and etc...
that is one easy-ass fuel pump R&R
This is the most entertaining car content I’ve watch in a hot minute
this mf is a genious
This is a fantastic segment!!! Hope to see more. Keep up the great work on your channel Donut!
Awesome episode
DONUT GARAGE NO MUSTACHE GARAGE
Vihn was an awesome dude!! Super chill and funny! Glad he got the 350z
Vinh had the donut guys sweating lol
I'm so happy for him but I'm so jealous cuz the z is my dream car
Some of the best content on cars out there! You guys need a UK team!
I really liked this video.   Educational, big prize, timed and fun. Simple enough for someone starting to learn how to work on cars. Cool prize for the contestant. Delivered in a very timely manner. Great content and the support of you guys helping him out was awesome.  For the next one I would start with the rules before the contestant works on the car:  Use of Google vs discounted time Clue Video hint Wrong part
Love these videos
Liked this video so fast, please keep this series going
Love it
that series is great  :)
James over there looking like bitboy crypto
I didn’t like this guy at all. Get someone likable
Knew it! Crank position sensor. Owned a 2004 G35!
Mustang
This is one of those ideas that's so brilliant that you wonder why no other car so has done anything like it.
Great idea for a video, would love to see more!
Love this! E36 next! Hope you guys stick to giving away sweet budget-ish rides that your viewers would drive!
This should be an Olympic  sport
Damn I want a free car what do I got to do to be in the show I've been a member since before you guys have 1 million
I like this
I love these videos. Although I would have not started the vehicle at all.
Great idea for a show!!! Very entertaining
Make this a series!
define fix.... if "fix" means get it to turn over even if it means fire shooting out of the intake... SIGN ME UP!!!
love u donut media, from london
I know these videos are probably really expensive, but would you consider making this a new series?
I love this series
But what would I have to do to get you guys to help me fix my Integra?  No it's not a GSR it's a b18a1 DA (I know you know what those mean) restore.  It's also one of my videos on my channel called "The life of Ruby".  It used to be in a beautiful red 4 door named Ruby, but the engine is now up to 318,000 miles and it's 3rd body.  So she's "Ruby 3" now.
This is great I learned quite a bit.
I absolutely love this video and I beg for more to come in the future. Please donut!!!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️
Having owned many nissans, when in doubt just replace the sensor. I've had quite a few die on me
Fk yeahhhhhhhhh good sport with the hint
Very nice episode, thank you! But was it real - random subscriber managed to fix the car, or everything scripted, actions, phrases...etc?
Just to remind everyone there's not a 2 hour limit on buying cars and fixing them in real life and eventually I Guatenteee you will find the problem. Just ask yourself is it worth it and if all the problems were fixed in 1 year would your investment still make you happy?  Also let me know I'll come on the show from Virginia! I am a Xpel PPf / Tint installer and a car enthusiast with a little a good amount of mechanical knowledge. Get me a rotary car to fix.
Pickle
That was definitely impressive! Especially for a car he doesn’t own or have knowledge of. Glad he got to take her home✊🏽
Make Track day Datsun ;) best wishes from Europe Lithuania!
Nah man you know, if I’m not pumping I can’t even get started bro. You know what I’m saying?
Y’all outdid yourself with this. Really hoping it’s going to be a whole series. Y’all don’t just make videos, you make television for YouTube 🤙
I don't know how to get chosen for this. But please consider me. I'll be extra funny just for you guys.
That was damn awesome
Please don't choose me. I can't fix shit.
Why not ask for an OBD2 scanner?
I’m low key kinda jelouse
I thought they were gonna fix the hi low cars haha
can you buy me a $800 car
Love that all of you wanted him to win the car unlike other shows that would try to hinder the contestant you guys tried to help making the show a lot more fun to watch :)
You need to do a vid on the Toyota Tundra
the first thing I would have checked was the crankshaft sensor because owning a Z I would have checked all the things that has gone bad on mine buy I would have never checked the clutch or air filter
The editing on these videos is hilarious lmfao, especially at the start when vinh tried turning the ignition to start the engine lmao.
The nod and duces out the window when he leaves is 100% me.
Good job Vin! Congrats on the "new" car!
I could’ve finished this so fast 😭😭😭
I want to get one to start I have a daughter I want to leave somthing for
Air, fuel, spark and timing! You need 4 not 3
damn big fan watching from philippines.. if only I can buy some of those awesome donut merch.
Loved this
I frickin love this video dude
I'm loving this episode u help me out understanding how cars work
i think its one of  the best episodes yet pls make it a sreies
I LOVE THIS SERIES!! Keep them coming!!!
power,fuel,fire,air ?? Fuel pump fuse ?sparkplug wires and all wires ? Actual fuel in tank ,whag parts are off pluged air lines unplugged airlines, sensors , crank ? That car would be mine lololol i think now lets watch n see
More like this please.
That was awesome!
If only I was in Cali.... Can y'all come to Houston? Lol
This is hands down, 🔥🔥🔥 content.   Educational, super entertaining, and viewers get rewarded if they fix the vehicle. Sheeeesh! great stuff!
LMAO that clip nolan at the beginning
He won a altima coupe 🤡🗑
I liked this it was good. Maybe a carb muscle car next?
Dude that was a great contest but it would have been nice for him to have could have walked away with bonus money for points left on the clock let's say a hundred bucks a minute other than that great show great contest
Next a bmw
Absolutely a 350z fan I have one myself such a great car love it
This was an excellent idea
I wish you guys were here in texas my dad could of done it in less than an hour with his tools and his computer even without his computer😂
Do this but with random mechanics from random mechanic shops
This was fun! Need more episodes like this!
“If he asks for the right part we’ll give it to him.” *If he asks for the wrong part, we’ll give it to him*😈
I just love u guys A LOT❤️‍🔥
Do a MK3 next!!!!!!
I would have failed.
Great idea for a series. For the finale start with a car that has no engine so when they open the hood they're like WTF lol
this was fun! Give it to Donut to come up with new stuff!!
Hummm where was I when you guys were doing this? Did you guys ever consider coming down to Wilmington to give away a car?
These are so dope and I love this channel. Just too bad I can’t fix a car haha
I participated in a contest called the Plymouth/AAA Troubleshooting Contest when I was a senior in HS.  Got 2nd place in the state.  It was basically the same thing, except we were a team of 2 against several other teams.  Identically prepared/broken brand new Plymouth Voyagers were what we had to fix.  It wasn't all mechanical, either.  One of the dome lights was loose, and wouldn't come on.  The van wasn't the prize, but a scholarship to UTI was.  Got a big-ass trophy, but the school kept that.    That same year, I got a free '76 Chevy cargo van, when the owner told me, "Get it off my property by tomorrow, and it's yours."  All it needed to start & drive was a battery.   Completely died 6 months later, but it was fun while it lasted!
This is a great series idea! Bring Ben back for more content, he's a great mechanic!
If it was me I’ll bring my “mobile mechanic” plug it in and verify all the diagnosis and fix it….my car!!      But he went through by trial n error but a bit knowledge, he got it..
Donut media. Why was not scan tool used in beginning to start of all diagnosising
Hell yeah that’s pretty cool of you guys
This content is great. I’d watch indefinitely as a new car enthusiast if this becomes a series. This will help so many people.
There's only 5 YouTube things I need in life. Donut Media, Drive Tribe, Car Throttle, Everyday Driver, and anything with Jason Cammisa. It's a great time to be an automotive enthusiast as far as entertainment goes.
Yeah, I couldn’t have done that. I’d have never even gotten the clutch safety switch.
This is a cool concept.  Also I am pretty impressed with the contestant. He did WAYYY better than I would have.
I'm 23 I've had no classes on how to fix cars I just put common sense and parts together and I've rebuilty whole front suspension radiator and hoses and airflow
Listening to hear the fuel pump prime when the ignition is turned to ON is one of the first things I do.
DO NEXT WITH CHRIS FIX !!!!!
This type of video is awesome, not sure if there is but do a series of these!
Me next?
heyyyyyy i own a 2004 350z !!!
Do you guys reply
This series can be called as the fixer
From PH🇵🇭
Very cool video, and cool thing to do, you could tell that guy was stoked.
I dont know why watching them watch themselves was so funny 😂
absolutely love these
I'm not even a car guy but this is very entertaining
Love the concept guys! Amazing idea!
Keep doing this, I like this content I like seeing people think about stuff like this because there’s so many cars that have easy fixes that can be flipped for money
Great video!
Y'all some good dudes
It's not a neutral safety switch ..... It's a clutch switch . Nothing about it determines whether the car is in neutral or not
This channel is epic af
I'd love to do one of these if I could bring a diagnostic tool box with me. How does noone ask for a scan tool, spark plug light, or fuel pressure gauge?
Hehe,  I'd still give them the car just for the insane pressure he was under trying to fix it!!! 😅
Day 8 of asking where stocky
Second favorite video of all time!
should’ve called me up instead
I wanna see the negotiation, "You get another hour on the clock... but you have to name your child after James"
HILARIOUS!  Great idea.  Keep it going!
Do this video was actually fire, Like really made me happy that this guy won this. I know this sort of video is kind of expensive because you gotta like buy car and give it away but like good damn video lol
This is an awesome idea for a show. I'm stoked to see more
Yeah if only. I don't get that lucky. Lol
this is cool!
That was awesome!
Omg i wanna do this.
Would love to do this for my lil bro 😂😅
Love your content, can we Get more like this?
This was very cool
love how you actually help the person instead of not helping and keeping the car for the next ep
Lmao brand new 2004 nissan 350z
Good and awesome video like all time donut media
This was awesome!
So entertaining to watch
Im an engineer in uk with little to none car experience but would still love to have a gl
Very cool idea for videos. Fun and instructive !
More of this series cause you’re making us smarter and mechanics. More of this please. More.
I don't know how to say it ... but so many cool "video designer things" and so less cool shirts... Maybe it's U.S. taste or I'm dumb but you can make real awesome designe stuff so do it
This series is amazing! Great mix of all of the Donut hosts!
Great video. Glad he won.
Make more videos like this, Mrbeast mode all the way plz 🙏 🙌 💪
Another happy subscriber donut out here blessing people
Ngl, i probably wouldve buckled under the pressure. Excellent job of keeping your cool Vince. It scored you a pretty badass car!
Fantastic series idea. Can't wait to see more
im going to say 2 hours is not enough time for multiple problems.
Awesome guys
Hearing that song “Love for the Ocean” from the turbo episode of hi-low makes me feel things I didn’t know I could feel. It makes me wanna just mob down PCH and walk in slo-mo and stuff for no reason. Gives me chills man.
The things I always check. Spark, fuel, compression
im not sure if i would win that lol but always willing to try, perhaps a corvette, honda crx, or a miata, personally a 9-11 would be baller but thats a specialty car
Don't let me on there I'll fix every car
Fuckin A-right! That's awesome! I really loved this one y'all. Do some more please.
i have learnt a lot sooooooo much, from this video daaaaamn
the beginning of the video reminds me of Hi-Lo
That was awesome
Great video, more like it
That is awesome. Congrats on the win
I watch chrisfix i woulda aced this 😎
I LOVE THIS GAME! I understand its expensive but please make more episodes. Even if its a once a year thing, its friggin awesome!!!!!!!!!
thAT WAS super radical guys like yal wanted him to win and that shows character and tegridy lol na but for real this is super cool guys
This should be a Collab with Mr.beast
Spark fuel air
How about a video where if Nolan can fix that rusty hunk of shit we won't make him keep it?
I appreciate the fact that Donut knows these videos are inherently way more fun when they win the car
That was a great episode to the start of a new series, not just the entertainment but K-nowledge dropped, looking forward to more. Oh, just gonna hit subscribe real quick. Lol.
This was awesome
Fly me over from ur let me do a ford 😂
Love these videos, best gameshow ever.
you should do an episode on ken block
Everything you need to know about Dodge super bee
This is why i love Donut....this and James
i've watched the first 5 mins and it's like a reality show  not bad but just wierd
This looks like so much fun! Not a chance I could of figured out and fixed all those problems in 2 hours though!! Haha
I was working on an altima with a no start issue... problems with that car were so many it was crazy ... No engine light on ... Good starter... Good alternator... Good fuel pump... Good computer... I couldn't figure out what was wrong with the car, so I started swapping parts ... somehow reset the computer got engine light on, and it was both camshaft position sensors ... put new ones in, and it started up ... it was a horrible experience
This episode gave me mtv vibes !😂
Yo, Vihn is a hero today!  Bravo my dude!
I LOVE THOSE
this was great in need more of this kind of content
All of these videos of people trying to fix the car is just more knowledge for myself. Love this series because of how fun it is to learn about what can stop a car from starting!
Bro would’ve fixed it with an hour left if he didn’t overlook the sensor. Good job bro I was rooting for you!!
These videos are so awesome!
I learned more through this video than I have through any other car media.
Glad to see that it's not obviously one of the people you have on staff this time. Last time was pretty lame
These guys either end up with a life-long fan or a mostly repaired vehicle with free labor hahaha. Nice.
Out of curiosity, was there a rule of not using diagnostic tools? First thing I would have done is plug my OBD reader.
Everything Donut does came together in this video. Beautiful job!
Yo donut! Come to cape town south Africa? I promise to show you some crazy shit 👀👀😜
I know what’s wrong with it. Ain’t got no gas in it.
Honestly I wouldn't even get past the first problem, props to the dude
this is a really cool  game and I like that you says what was manipulated and who to fix that! So I can learn..
This is car content that really matters.
I want it donut
More episodes of this plz lol
I soooooo wanna do this. Just don't give me a Ford Ranger.
That pregnant belly makes me think this car may be getting sold sometime in the future lol.
This was such a feel good episode. James and team y’all are the best.
I feel like the right kinda guy just won a new car.
Hinestly my maxima would start on 2nd or 3rd try cause the air filter
I like this show. Its fun.
Please do more of these!!!
Love it
Asian Nation numba juan
Wait… Why would you take time off the clock if he asks for the wrong part. Isn’t that cheating. Sounds wrong but ok.
Idk anything about cars so I would fail this even with a months worth of time. But if Donut ever does one of these where your telling an inexperienced person how to fix a part then time/grade them on their performance. That could be interesting.
Next time don't keep any fuel in the fuel tank then see how much time it takes to figure out the missing link!.
😃
The fact they don’t have YouTube premium it’s hilarious hahahah
Feel super happy for the dude. Donut media, you guys are awesome
😅😅😅
This needs to be perfected but I’m in
He could become the next DK
Vinh looks like asian Vtuned lol
Owned cars for 40 years and barely know where the oil goes. And I like it that way, I give you money and you fix this broke trash.
These ones are cool. You never know what's gonna be wrong with the car.
Cool video
I’m just waiting for someone to pull up a cris fix video
My car's been in shop for a week because of that stupid sensor. Swapped it out and the new one failed in an hour. Found an OEM one (super rare) and I hope that dons't fail cause it takes 3hr to put it in.
Absolutely loved this!!!!! what a cool episode concept. The clutch sensor would have stopped me dead. Could be a regular series!!!!!
Love the theme of the show, but it looks like you guys are immediately falling prey to my biggest gripe about giveaway shows: LOCATION!  I realize the different budgets and legalities of different locations, but it always seems that the hosting show only pulls in people that live nearby. That makes it frustrating for those of us not within driving distance (about 5hrs would be a good max). As nice as SoCal looks, I personally don’t have an urge to visit unless it’s something really specific.  So I’m suggesting you take this on the road. Move to a different city every few eps. Hell, make a companion series about local car culture and open up the world! Get stuck with the rock crawlers in the Rockies, turn some laps at Indy or Daytona, drive snowmobiles in Alaska or Maine, road-trip on Hwy66!  You guys have the means to be even bigger, show us you can!
I'm not even a car guy, but I love this channel
Good shit gentlemen! Love to see the love and opportunities going out to regular folks. I’d love to see someone get an opportunity to “fix” a Tacoma that might have some off-roading upgrades applied.
The creativity in this channel is literally ENDLESS, stoked to be a subscriber an can’t wait for more content to come.
My friends dad scoped by a 95 f-250 that was gonna be parted out bc it didn't turn over. Took him a couple of hours but he got it running and has had it for 4ish years now.
that “i love you” at the end from james really hit different, i love you too james🥺
Driiiip drip drop....
Love it! Great job Donut crew!
Can I come?
There would be no way I would have known all that and fixed the car lmao
Uuuuum where's my invite to such event???
Nice
Damn his girl big!
let me get there, im telling you i can fix everything
Comment for the algorithm 👍Donut ROCKS!
he just instals a car bomb
I can only imagine the level of stress that Vinh might have been under. Troubleshooting a car on a timer with these many issues and without any diagnostics tools is a nightmare.
An impressive show all the way around.
This is such a dope idea
This man is good
I enjoyed this Love Vince
How much to use the car manual for 30 seconds? 1 hour? Yikes.
Loving these series
this video idea is sensational, stupendous and sexy!
I think the rev gauge doesn't move when the crank or the cam sensors are gone,  that's a quick way to see if the sensor is gone
Awesome episode!!!
I loveeee this. The suspense, the ups and downs...makes for great show content. You gies should definitely allocate more for these 🤣🔥
I want to be the next sub to get a car started and keep it. Prease!
I want more of this
I love this series. Such an entertaining concept. Well done Donut!
I found this channel in 2017 with your Science Garage episode on VTEC! Love the channel, been subscribed since 2018 when you guys were around 1mil subscribers I think. You guys were a huge part of why I'm a car guy now and you're hands down my favorite car channel.  Do a Toyota Celica next
Super fun watch. Can't wait for more :D
Now this is sweet content
What a car needs to start  1.) Spark 2.) Air 3.) Fuel 4.) Compression 5.) Timing Always check those 5 things if your car doesn’t start
I need a new car lol I can’t afford one atm
Lol nice, I would have cut the nss wires and twisted them together. Would have ran a wire to the fp would have only replaced the CPS LMFAO
Can anybody call the number on the we buy junk cars shirt?🤣
I hate working on cars. Please do an F150, any Year.
Great video loving these ones
This is a sick ass series guys!
9:53 BUBBLES!!!
Hey donut thanks to intruducing me to post malone my favourite song is "Better Now"
Mr beast collab?
great vid guys. beautiful Z
HAHAHAHA!  Loved!
What if I'm not a mechanic? Can I get a chance to win a car? Just wondering
lemme work on an e90
awesome episode!
Definitely lots of help on this one. But supremely entertaining nonetheless.
They always say it. but its doubtful. Other large influencers have been proven of this (hiring people to be on set)...cough, cough jimmy
Cheaters! lol Good on you men.
I will newer win a car
14:48 we've all had that exact look on our face trying to start your car
Needs a bonus round of some sort maybe:  "Keep as many mods as you can install with remaining time"
Hi
Dope!
Good stuff. New show called Sabotage Garage.
Sad bc i cant binge watch this series :(
Do something obscure as f@#$. But something cool.
Love Donut Media And its amazing that you have the oportunity to give away awesome cars on a game like this!
Air fuel spark oil battery computer
Man if I won a car or not id JUST love to hang with you guys.. this was one of the best shows you've done
Samcrac 😂

This is a great gameshow actually
So, first congratulations to the winner. Second, i love how the entire team worked together and from each show each one played their part just like how we watch wheel house or money pit, or B2B. All those episodes combined into this single show. Kudos guys. Well done!
THIS IS A SICK IDEA. QUALITY 👏 CONTENT 👏  (Also. Where were the safety jackstands????)
Make sure Goshen isn't hiding in the trunk.
I didn't finish the video yet but I hope this dude get the car
This is a really good concept. Keep doing it
You also need timing for the stuff to run cause if you were to change cam timing you could set it up so there's no compression or changing the fuel injector timing so the fuel comes to late or too early there's alot the make four stroke run two Strick's tho just need fuel air and spark well and compression
The coolest guys on YouTube
This was awesome ! Man I wish I was ah mechanic but I only do bondywork 😩
As a teenager it would be fun if I could be on there and test my knowledge
I bet I would win this and I'm not a mechanic
Jimmy P made a deal Vin could'nt refuse
I’m delighted he won. Seems like a cool guy
From one boy who grew up in Louisville KY area to another, love you hump! Wish we could of hung out back then, who knows we might have been at a car meet and not know it!
This is really cool.
This series makes me so nervous! I don't want to see anyone lose!!
Suck squeeze bang blow but key locations of key parts are hard to find especially if you don't know the Nissan
I might not be able to fix a car but I can dig one out of 10 ft of snow and ice in 20 mins, 10 if I'm late for work
Sick
You should turn this into a competition between people and air it like Masterchef 😂
Do a VW. So no one will be able to fix it. On top of that, make it like a 2002 Jetta or Golf
You should do this type of video again the car I recommend would be ecoboost Ford mustang
The last episode was a lot more fun with all the curve balls thrown in, like the exhaust upgrade!
love these videos
That was really fun to watch!!
Awesome show
I wish someone would hold me the way Nolan Holds zach 😪 4:30
Good stuff guys👌
Hes one of our "Actual" subscribers... Why add the Actual? 🤔🤣🤣
I'd watch a whole series of just this concept
Congratulations Vin that was close. BTW that Nissan 350z looked very clean again congratulations Vin
Congratulations, Vinh! Cheers to everybody! 🍻
you should do a beater car next time
I really like this concept donut should do more like this content love you donut Media ♥️♥️♥️
This was such a great video! Hope there’s more to this series
And this is why anyone who works on a car needs a good scan tool.
This format is amazing. Thanks and happy Sunday to all of you!
YES!! I LOVE THIS SERIES THANK YOU! 🙏
shout out to donuts writer for this one
I would need 2 hours of google though lmao
I definitely wanna be next to fix/win a car
I honestly love this series plsss do more of this!
This is an awesome concept. Love it.
As a professional  in the field  and a buyer of used cars, i always bring my scan tool with me to go look at a vehicle that im wanting to buy. All of the sabotaged things woulda been found in under 30 minutes with a good scan tool
A video on Sunday? We have been blessed boys
Great contain 🔥
You know it's a good day when Donut uploads twice
Man this shit got my heart beating so fast lmao. Still haven’t finished the video either 🤣🤣
Do a 335i hehe
Day 309 of asking Donut to bring old B2B back
Part of me really wants to go on this show but I know I’d be the first guy to not get the car😂
Those intro effects actually reminded me of the OG Bumper 2  Bumper episodes. 😭😭 Miss it like crazy
Good episode looks like it went to a good guy
Do more of these guys!
Air, fuel spark is wrong!!! It need air/fuel mixture, compression and spark. All that on right ratio and time. So he missed the compression!
@donutMedia I also require a car
I love how they really give the car up for them. They give every hint possible for them to win. Donut really cares about people.
This video made me happy, made me smile.
You guys gave that away pretty much
The WWE of automotive 'journalism'!?!!!!!!
I respect vinh for taking this. I would never be able to do this
If they pick me, I'm bringing a scanner and multimeter. :P
Intriguing gameshow concept
James, aka Jimmy Pump.. I'm a huge fan. Really wish i could see more content.. Less that mustache? Again. Big fan.
How can I get in on this?!?!
i want that car
Looks like im up to the challenge. So when we gonna start?
Title for this serires should be "Fix it! Keep it!"
I like this. I work for john deere at the training center they do some creative bugs for us
This would be a cool tv show to watch
:)
Wouldn't it be hilarious if they just removed a transmission
Mr. Beast pumphrey
Hey. I'm moving upstate new York in 2 weeks  ..if it's broke I can fix it. Hit me up
the nissan chime is stuck in my head and now every time i get in a car my head sort of plays it in the background
Im so happy for him winning 😁 This is the kind of giveaway vids that dont make you jealous at all
this was fricking awesome, yeah!!!!
Vietnamese repesent babyyyy
This guy knows how to work on cars. The average dildo wouldn’t know wtf to do other than calling a tow truck.
First hour gang
Bring me in, a handicapped man, in to do this challenge next time! I'm not immobile or anything like that FYI. Thanks my boys!
hi james im 13 can i work on a project car with you
This is a legit show guys. Like i haven't watched a show / game show in years or ever really fully. Awesome job with this i feel like this is your Hot Ones
Dope video idea
shes beautiful 🥲
not first!
@jamespumphrey said “crankshaft” nice lol
Is James just the Matty Matheson of cars ?
This guy clutch safety switches
This was a great video do it again doenst have to be such an expensive car
hi donut media
Such a great show!!
Still a good looking car. Also, it's the best car in the world because IT'S A FREEEE CAR! That's awesome
Awesome job to that dude.
This needs to be a series. Amazing work, guys.
Man this makes you really appreciate an obd2 scanner lol
Love this video idea hope there will be more.
Great new series
Up to speed on Gale Banks, please
Love these! Sign me up
Im 00:31 seconds into this as i write this and its already my favorite show on the channel
Pick me!! Pick me!! 🤣
Poor Vinh.  Dude knows repairs, but not being able to verify sensor locations and such killed him.  Was a great job of finding and fixing those things in under 2 hours
“We’ve got a crank position code” Jobe - 👀👀👀👀👀 LOLed
Your are awesome guys!!!
I would watch SEASONS of this at it's full 2hr length Love Donut
You should do more and add in things like phone a friend and peek at a repair manual
My school that teaches us about cars and they watch ur videos
yo the parts truck got me laughing so hard  awesome idea for a game show donut
I'd be so greasy , and try to sneak a peek in the parts trunk to see what's in there
This was fantastic.  So happy to see him score that car!
next time you should get a Maserati and let them fix it 😂😂
And mine still wouldn't start. Cause no compression 🥲
Love you too James
You should have maybe paused the clock to give the guy time to put it on Jack Stands.  That was a bit sketchy to watch lol.
nice
Ayo just an idea, but what if you get a person who's fairly new to cars, and let them know whats wrong and they get youtube, but since they haven't done those things before, they would still get the same time limit and same rules as usual other than that
This should be the new series. Giving people money or the car if they can fix it. Awesome video
Me in the contestants position: I know what's wrong with it, ain't got no gas in it!
This has been both very fun and educational for me. Thanks!
Clutch safety switch? Why US have always the dumbest things in the world? We don’t have that shit in Europe, we know when the car is in neutral 😅
Yoooo must be Hella nice to get to go visit!
Awesome vid
This was dope!! Please do more of this. Congrats the new owner 🎉
We call it the parts cannon
nice
I once got an 86 camaro given to me if i could get it to start but i only had 15 minutes. i got it in under a minute i hit the key no crank also, buuut under the dash i seen a spark as it was getting evening, i went under there was a bent piece of metal on a fuse panel bent it back and boom free IROC
I love this series, it’s definitely one of the most entertaining
Make a bonus round where if after starting the car if they car blow it up by beating on ie doing donuts they get a even better car like a GT3 RS 911 !!!
Way better than pimp my ride. This needs to be a regular feature!
Poor man's Mr. Beast.
I was like yelling at my phone the whole time, would have taken me 30 minutes tops lol
This is better than PMR holy shit
He did really great, congrats!
You should do this with rookies who only have Google
I love that they gave hints. It would suck if they ever lose lol
These go beast mode id live to go to donut and get a car
I love this series
Really cool show guys!
I probably would have found the air and fuel issue and maybe the clutch but I would have never found the crank sensor 😂
Ran when parked. 🤪
would be fun to watch how you guys broke a car and go to mechanics shops and see if they can fix it and how much they money it will cost
Donut single handedly got me through uni 😂
I gotta be honest I’d have trouble doing this. When I’m diagnosing an issue on my vehicles at home and my kids start coming around asking a bunch of questions I’m like leave me alone haha. Don’t think James would leave the garage.
I was waiting for y’all to throw in some aftermarket parts like the previous episode contestant. Would have been cool to see if he could swap some new wheel/tires, racing seats or an exhaust kit with those 17 min left. Great episode!! Love watching you guys give back to the DONUT 🍩 community
dude this guy is a machine.
I wish they swapped the gas with diesel, then ran it dry.
I really like what u guys did...Thumbs up
This might be the best series in the channel, educational and very entertaining
These might be my favorite.
A Nissan that doesn't run means it's time to buy a new car. Preferably not a Subaru, Mitsu, Hyundai/Kia or another Nissan or you'll end up with the same problem real soon. 👍
My first request would have been for a ODB code reader.
What a cool idea!
You guys are such good sports. Love it.
I know what’s wrong with it. Ain’t got no gas in it.
Narrative of Self is the result of a feedback loop between “Separate Self” & Cosmos🎈
Stop. This segment is horrible. <- that’s what I said before I watched it. I’m just jealous. It was wonderful. Love you guys.
So frikken fun!!!  Way to go, Vihn !
Cool video
This is awesome and should def be a whole show! Like with several contestants who get a try and the one with the fastest time gets the car or something... right?!? Very fun to watch!
So he just casually rolls out without a license plate huh?
I LOVE these!
Straight up this episode was so fun
You should get a certified mechanic with 30+ years experience to see if they could do this in 2 hours.
Yooo this is an awesome vid and an awesome idea its like u the Mr beast but like ur own car version
I'm 17, so I'd totally fail, but damn this looks fun
Zach's Miata clutch change taught me and held my hand through the clutch change of my 95 escort so yea donut videos save lives and beaucoup bucks. Thanks donut fam
Those videos are damn entertaining!
More content like this please!
Get a high school shop student out on this show, a non professional contestant would be cool to see.
I would be the first person to lose if I got on here lol
Why couldnt I been pick! This would been awesome and Ive all that before with cars I've actually bought 😂
Just needs some tlc
This was great feels like a proper show
Let me fix a Tacoma, somebody’s got too lose.lol
Can we get an Up To Speed on Hyundai?
This was sick, should do a GTI next
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!!!
Awesome video. Awesome car!
Craigslist ads be like: “the car is absolutely perfect, only thing is it doesn’t start”
These are really fun, and honestly probably really helpful for the masses. 🙌
Probably one of my favorite videos since HiLow2. But also a great video for automotive tech training programs to consider sharing
I had the same issue of a crankshaft position sensor on my 2000 Honda insight. Little bit of diagnosing, boom, back on the road again. Crazy how one sensor can completely immobilize a car.
Bruh I wanna be on this show so bad man idk if I’d fix it in time but if you ever wanted to hear a sailor fix a car lemme know 🦑😂
This was very cool. Happy, then anxious. Keep it up
Let me know when you come across a 1978-1982 Corvette you'd like to give me for free to fix.
Yeah but what mechanic wouldn't be able to use all data when fixing a car? Come on who the hell knows where every fucking fuse and relay and pump actually is on a vehicle, especially the one you're not familiar with. Nobody is that good.
Are they gonna do more content about James' Trueno?
please choose me next time
Thank you, I learned so much!
More of these videos please!!!
Instead of wasting so much time looking for the fuel rail test port, and fuse boxes, I would’ve just cycled the ignition switch a couple of times and listened for the fuel pump to energize.
This is an awesome concept for a show !
Omg, I know Vinh! He's good friends with my brother. He owns an amazing shop in so cal that specializes in off road trucks!
Donut*:- we are like Mr beast.. but u gotta work for it..
Dang I love this video
This would be a nice series. 🤲🏽 Bless our eyes with it. **likes video.
So glad this was brought back, I watched the Integra video multiple times 🤠
I cannot believe how much fun that was to watch please do more
Would love to see more of this   Just a thought but what about a complete novice with a mechanic talking them through it over the phone
Broooo!! Vin would be a perfect fit for Donut media i bet!
2005 Honda civic
Damn I wish I was able to be on this episode because I replaced every single thing on this episode on  my G35 over the time I had my car lol. .
This was an awesome new series idea.  Only thing I'd suggest is also have some other lifelines, like phone a friend or the ability to use a scan tool on a 1-to-10 time exchange.
I would watch this as a reality show
Donut media, you are geniuses. This is the stuff that car people wanna see
this is such a cool video idea. thank you!
did he just forget his wife 😭💀
Vehicle need 4 things to start .  air, fuel , spark as well as compression
Best YouTube car video ever!  Dude has good skills.
Does someone at donut have a discovery 2??
these are fun to watch, ty for doing this again.
YouTube car community is the best hands down. Free knowledge for all 👍🏻
I love how this is basically just giving away a car with extra steps. Like you guys hint the answer away its great :)
“how do you feel about YOUR BRAND NEW 2004 NISSAN?!”😂
Y'all hit the gold mine again with this one I was on a rollercoaster of emotions watching it I'm crying tears of joy rn I can't wait for the next episode.
Would like to see the Lux side on the VQ G37 or G35 and the VHR 3.7L is far superior
This was an awesome video
Hell yeah, you guys are awesome for helping him out a little here and there
I've been subscribed since there was a 100 subscribers who how come I didn't get picked
I am a vq owner but I didn’t know about the clutch safety control switch
Mr beast if he was a car nerd:
Day: 8 make donut magazine please
This was a good and realistic episode
I love you too James.
Im here
Nice job man 🙂👍
wait, it only takes 3 things to start an engine  *ChrisFix would like to know your location*
NOOO I WANTED IT TO BE ME
Hmong brotha
That was an awesome video
Hey guys, I hope you're having a great Sunday.
That's a clean 350Z!
This was such a great video.  Good job guys!
Not sure how you bought a 350z. All the ones by me are 20k or more for high mileage clapped examples
Everyone knows vin is his nickname since vehicle identification number is his full name, obviously a mouthful.
Send that guy round to my house to take a look at my van, guys got some good skills
What car should we do next??
This could be an awesome series! Please keep it going!!
love the explainers..
Glad i turned the notifications on
Please make this a series! I love this concept!
Great show
Hey Samcrac just did this
You got your lightning whirler. Your fuel making happener.
Hey Donut! Just wanted to thank y’all for getting me into cars. I was trying to, but all the car terms and stuff went way over my head. Thanks to y’all, I learned a lot. From one Kentuckian to another James, MO PAWAH BABY (Edit) Holy smokes! Thanks for all the likes! Goes to show how awesome the car community is.
love this series
I'm assuming they're still gonna dump the registration fees on him
69
Imagine if chrisfixit came in a costume 🤣
Now this is a game show I can get behind
Great content as usual
7 minutes.
This entire video is an ad don't bother guys
These videos makes our days better
That clutch switch could have easily been an afternoon filled with explitives.
The Z is back
Suck squeeze bang blow right?
Ayy
Did you guys turn into mr beast or something? I know you guys did this with a Acura integra tho. Pls do more. The money is one thing to worry about tho
They got nervous quick lmao
nice vid
This format is so freaking good, keep it up!
The bond between car and man is amazing … i purchased my first car 2 years back after saving up and then i spent most of my free time just opening it up … changing things … detailing it … my family calls me mad for spending so much time on the car but i know i am not alone 💯🔥❤️
Congratulations if you made it early and found this comment🥳
“Just only one problems, IT DOESN’T RUN”! Oh yeah just a little bit of work it’ll be fine!!!! 😒 😂 😂

Good morning everyone…..!!!  Great work
Y’all should lock the keys in there 😂 so they can’t even go in
