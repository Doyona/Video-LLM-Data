Football Fact: This was Petr Cech’s final game in his career, and he ended it with a loss and he wasn’t in the squad.
Player gets shot VAR offside la
Glad this isn’t this season or we wouldn’t have scored that pen I can tell richy would probably missed
Everton are really good at beating top teams
As for calvern lewin some1 needs to getta grip of him and tell him the teans more important than him just cos he wants to score a goal or try where another player for us was on his own dead centre in box instead of squaring it for a defo goal he tried to come inside were he lost it luckily we wud of got a pen if he wasnt offside which btw was disgusting on lewins part how he cudnt stand in an onside position the position we were in shows his lack of experience still if he was onside he shud of squared it for 2_0 but no wanted glory ...i always use kane as the example of being all for himself not the team was wen england v ctoatia semi final world cup england 1_0 up cruising ball put through to kane brought keeper ofline but instead of that easy cut back to sterling went for goal and missed the rest is history were croatia got 1 shot on goal in 90 minutes scored then again in extra time losing us the chance at france in final kane did by not squaring and being 1 greedy mf well lewin you need to start playing the game for everton and not calcern lewin b4 u get dropped like a compossed bag of spuds
Prickford reminds me of a turkey.  Dashing out his coup and plucking around the pen spot .
Pickford really is shockingly bad
Mendy is starting to make mistakes now last week against Leeds and here against everton lol
Simply not good enough from Lampard, Kepa needs to let him go
Richaison should learn to pass to his teammates,big meanie!
Naw Chelsea knows how spurs felt
Chelsea really thinking they are kings yet got schooled by a fantastic Everton team who where all over them 😂😂
Havertz needs to improve
Allan is a beast. Best cdm in the prem real warrior 💙Coyb
Hahaha nobody blame the goalkeeper ? Ah no because Mendy not Kepa.
...more matches playing just for homes betting,when homes have to lost lot money,they make meaning with few persons from stuffs or from playground...
How didn't he save that penalty 😂
Not even being bies, everyone can agree that was no way a pen dcl ligit ran into mendy, JOKES absolute jokes
Sad times
I feel less bad to lose to Everton they played well after seeing Tottenham and liverpool fail to beat small clubs 😂
I see Everton's rent boys got a poxy win.
Pickfords save from Reece James’s volley is too underrated
As a CFC fan always hate travelling to Everton. Our bogey team.
Iv been a big critic of Pickford but what a save from James shot
Chelsea dominated but just got unlucky. it happens.
Players hugging each other while the sheep sit apart with their face nappy's on! LOL
Chelsea lose one game and suddenly get slammed with hate, shame to see the lack of brain cells of people in these comments.
All the germans in the Chelsea squad are a disaster. Definitely undercover nazis trying to get revenge on the British.
Pickford masterclass
Strikers go down with the slightest touch now, looking for penalties, its disgusting to watch. Referees used to book players for diving but with a while now it seems to have disappeared. I've never seen so many penalties being given as I'm seeing now in the Premier League, defenders are afraid to do their job. De Gea was critisized the other day in a match for pulling away from a ball that an incoming striker was going for, he did it to avoid a penalty because he knew the striker would dive if touched.
DCL played it smart  He knew he could get that penalty
post was out here making pickford look good
I think Chelsea still needs a 100M£ GK
Chelsea will not win the league simple as that top4 thats it
that penalty could have got me more points on fantasy damm
Rough night for Chelsea, after conceding the penalty, Everton were hard to break down. Alot of decent teams in prem can be very tight at back when they need to be
Pickford deserves respect.
Ziyech , pulisic and CHO are all injured , havertz keeps having to play out of position so everyone relax, when we have fit attack we’ll go back to usual, be patient
Havertz is the new Kepa
I'll be honest - Chelsea were much the better team in the 1st half but Everton came back strongly in the 2nd, so maybe just about deserved to win
Congrats to Everton.
I’m sorry, Everton we’re not good Chelsea were just unlucky
a penalty what's the game come to girly player's
We have got to take our chances better, this is what costed us apart from a silly decision from Mendy. We have to be more consistent in taking chances. This team have the materials for a top 4 finish and a trophy maybe.
Chelsea are trash
One of the first penalties I’ve seen this season that actually looks like a penalty
unlucky, wasnt our night but we move! up the chels
Lampard claimed in his interview DCL is possibly the best striker in the league.  £900 Million release  clause in a new contract now😁
Chelsea are a small club
Chelsea 😊
Only Sly Sports could make it look good for Chelski. Everton had more chances on target. And one of their ex players said they could of played for 2days and not scored🤣🤣
CHELSEA WHY YOU ?  1 TEAM AND TICKET GONE😑
Chelsea haven’t won a game against a team above 13th place this season.........
COYB💙
bring back kepa
cant belive chelsea didnt atleast get a draw, bit unlucky
Woodwork fc back again
When pulisic plays chelsea is different
Alan is the biggest moaner ever
Pickford had an unreal game
Let’s be honest guys, mendy has been amazing this season, it’s about time he makes a mistake
what a bs game chelsea deserve the 3 points
how tf did Pickford perform in this game we could of easily won
Pickford is playing better
How can Pickford trip himself up and nearly pulled his hamstring😭😭😭😭 u shoulda shown that highlight
Chelsea had so many close chances
Kai was awful Reece James best player on the pitch, can’t win every game keep going boys 💙
That early shot by James that hit the post was saved by Pickford it just nicked his thumb as he dived across brilliant from David very depressed Forest fan
He had to make a mistake some time he's not perfect
Why is there no criticism for mendy? If that was kepa he would be getting death threats
That’s good for spurs that’s Everton COYS
Wow
Not the game I watched....Everton created a lot more than what Sky showed in first half
First loss for chelsea after nine wining matches
As much as I'm not that big of a fan of Pickford, he played outstandingly today.
So pleased for Frank. YNWA
Pickford and mendy swapped body's
Chelshit
I think its time Mason mount started getting more minutes, another English talent being wasted because of a overpriced foreign signing
Win or loss we are still Chelsea
im actually annoyed, this could have been an easy three points for chelsea
Let’s hear the fans booing the BLM then.
When Everton play two attacking fullbacks we concede from the wings but when we play 4 centre backs we keep our second clean sheet of the season
The Mount lob attempt aside, I think Pickford had an excellent game. We always will slate him when he's poor, but good keeper performances don't get recognised enough.
Good result for us, but it was close!
Chelsea could have easily won
Jammy blue noses 👃
Chelsea were pretty unlucky I must say, but we move
Unlucky lumpard most overated manager ever
Just because Jordan Pickford had a walk in the park against Chelsea - does not mean he is still the best goalkeeper. Unfortunately from an England perspective he is still a liability sometimes to England and Everton with certain errors which still plague his game. He got lucky tonight, but won't be so next time out.  Nevertheless. Congratulations to Everton, but it wont be easy in the return fixture as SW6.
Really unfortunate for james he played pretty good but this shows how much of an impact pulisic and ziyech make
Oi I know Pickford's been erratic the last few games but a solid game from him.
Chelsea fans in the comments saying James is better than Trent, Jesus Wept, the same fans who say VVD cant be a great CB because hes only done it for "two seasons" Back in your lane lads.
Glad you agree they only won because of a shitty penalty decision. They really didn't deserve to. Calvert-Lewin had his foot so high he could've seriously injured Mendy had he pulled it down not even a second later. You need to seriously reconsider renaming to the Penalty League because it's getting beyond a joke.
Chelsea were unlucky
Leeds beat chelsea, chelsea beat leeds, Everton beat Chelsea. This season is so open
Mendy gave DCL a V-trigger
Kepa can't save penalties, Tottenham fans know all about that 😂
Havertz is assssssss
Mendy is becoming a professional boxer
Stay alert control the virus ruin lives and football
The players had fight in them tonight against them rent boys spend all that money but still can’t beat us at goodison ahaha
Lucky Everton 🤷‍♂️
Although he kept a clean sheet, England must be scraping the barrel if Pickford is ur number 1 keeper. He was all over the place. If he was German, he’d be 8/9/10th choice keeper. All top teams have a good keeper. Portugal/Argentina don’t but they have world class strikers. Kane can’t do it all for England. Poor team that lives off their shitty last World Cup run which was soo easy and still fucked it up.
Get in toffees
No Ziyech No party this shows. We couldn’t unlock a defence of 4 CB not one Fullback.
Piggy is all over the place
20 second Bet365 advert everytime.....so annoying
Pickfords back ENGLAND NO1 💙
Sooo frustrating to lose that, but we move.. up the Chels!!
Half of Everton’s chances arnt even on this sky sports are a joke 😂
Var was kind of dodgy here. I definitely think DCL was offside for the penalty but not by the margin they made it out to be. They drew the lines from his arms but then Zouma’s foot, not his arms/shoulder which was further out than his foot. They really should be measuring from the same parts of the body here, even though if they did, I’m sure it would have been still offside. But for the sake of consistency, should be done next time in case there ever is a situation where that makes a difference
I don't no why all these haters are saying we ate trash but then the goal we conceded was from a mistake form the keeper  What can we do about that??use our telepathic powers or what
Quality save from Pickford 1:12
Another shitty game of the OVERRATED premier League
We should play 442 (diamond) we had know natural wingers on the pitch, timo werner is chelsea best striker. We can't play a natural born striker on the wing. It hurts to see him being wasted. It takes the sharpness out of striker when being played out of position. For an instance look a auba?
Pickford the type of goalkeeper to make the save harder just so he looks better🤣
So you’re telling me that we lose to Newcastle and Southampton. But we have 2 clean sheets against 1st and 3rd
So much for the best league in the world, a lot of boring football this weekend so far 👎🏻
This is how sky can do better on YT. Commentator says "and they deserve it on the strength of an excellent 20 minutes" but that's the first highlight they show.  If it's been an excellent 20 minutes, show some of it...
What was Mendy thinking lol
Being studying football tables since December 2009 and must say Chelsea and Everton are equal in table of premier league 2019/20 season look closely - and points up More people study better I still think either Chelsea or Everton can win the premier league
Thanks mendy 🤍coys!
Tottenham licking their lips
Mendy got caught napping.
Pickford had another nightmare but got away with it!
Mendy been with kepa for too long now lmao. Wouldn't it just be funny if he became a flop now. Funny but not what I'd like to see cus I know his back story. Wish him luck with his Comeback!
The referee had an agenda against Chelsea it wasn't a penalty Everton is a cheat I hope they get relegated
Unpopular opinion:Chelsea have been very overrated this season and the signings they have made have not made the impact they need to,their unbeaten run has been sort of frauded considering their UCL group is very easy and hasn’t beaten a EPL side higher than 12th,just my opinion tho would like you lots feedback
Chelsea ain’t beaten anyone in the top half of the table. Title contenders my arse
What a poor performance by cfc they will drop to fifth by Sunday after Leicester and Southampton win
Chelsea haven’t beat a team in the top half of the table and there fans think there title challengers😂😂
Chelsea suck
Lampard is playing Werner in the wrong position because all the wingers are injured. If he was centre forward he would be playing better.
The Curse of the Chelsea keepers strikes again 🧙🏽‍♂️
Can always rely on Chelsea for a bit of top banter
On an unrelated note, can't wait for the Burnley arsenal 6 pointer tbh tho both are really close but I think Burnley are gonna scrape a win after David Luiz bicycle kicks a man to the shadow realm
yay
Why does Reece James think he’s TAA😂
Kai Havertz is a flop
Chelsea are yet to beat a top 10 team frauds
We did our best tonight, it wasn’t our night. Just history repeating itself as they say. Goodson park has become a nightmare for Chelsea in recent years. Three straight win for Everton against Chelsea at home.
Pickford and mendy switched bodies this game.
Chelsea haven’t beat a team over 14th  This season 🥸
Lampard out
absalout bullshit
Everton might have won.. but Pickfords still a crap goalkeeper.
anyone else think that is weird that the ball is moving in the image for offside. it should be still when struck unless they used an image that was after it's been hit and is in motion.
When Pickford gets a clean sheet you know you played bad.
Everton's two clean sheets this season have been against Tottenham n Chelsea... go figure.
As a Chelsea supporter, they need to play CHO , Pulisic and maybe Reece James on the wing , Havertz isn’t playing that well , could say the same for Werner
Like seriously, how can people call Chelsea title challengers when all the teams they have beaten so far are from the bottom half of the table or about going into relegation?
The amount of options Chelsea had to score🤦🏽‍♂️
Chelsea haven't beat a team that are in the top 10 yet 👀
OK, so when Pickford yeeted Van Dijk everyone was saying LiVARscum should get a penalty still even tho it was offside, but when it happens to anyone else no one cares 🤔🤔🤔
Pickford is a clown, he's like Joe Hart but without the 3 seasons where he was actually a good keeper
Seems 300 million worth of players doesn't make a good team
NO ONE IS PROMISED TOMORROW JESUS IS THE WAY THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE AND THE ONLY NAME GIVEN BY GOD HIM SELF WHERE WE CAN BE SAVED JOHN 3.16 so please make today the day of your salvation and ask Jesus to save you ask him to forgive you of your sins and in that very moment he will give you eternal life and write your name in the book of life as the Angels in heaven rejoice Xx John 14:6 “Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.”
Pickford hass got to be the shittest goalkeeper
Sigurdson doing Spurs a service, always a Yed imo COYS
How did Chelsea lose to Everton 😂😂😂
Oh I thought that’s was Chelsea’s  best keeper 😂😂😂😂
Everton were brilliant tonight. Godfrey was brilliant, especially considering he's a right footed CB and had to play LB.
Arsenal sold Walcott and iwobi because they're not good enough and bought willian to challenge for CL spot.  Meanwhile Southampton and Everton are 1 point off 4th while arsenal are 15th lol.
Ruckus why didnt you reply to my RB liepzig comment? Was was mummy giving you a bath?
Every time we play at goodison park we are so bad
Very disappointing and a poor performance
Just remember that in 16/17 Chelsea lost to Liverpool, Arsenal, Spurs, Man United and STILL went on to win the league. Don't count us out of the title race just because we lost today lol
Ziyech is a must
I really don’t know what to think of Werner, seems like he’s really lacking some confidence but there’s quality to be utilised under a different system potentially
Chelsea still haven’t beaten any of the top 6 sides yet this season. Hmmm and now losing to Everton... still title contender? 🧐
COYB 💙 Good win and good to see Pickford back on form.
What a player Calvert Lewin has become!
Timo Werner woke up feeling dangerous🥵  0 shots on target❌ 27 trampoline touches🤩 50 misplaced passes😳 1 loss😢 0 talent👎🏻 1 regret about downgrading from Leipzig💔  Better than Djibril Cissé?
Woodwork was Everton’s best friend today 😂
James is on another level
Wow chelsea are title contenders 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Havertz really hasn’t proved he’s worth 70mil so far but it’s early days
It just was not Chelsea's day, Goodison Park is a nightmare for Chelsea.😔
RIDICULOUS. GET RID OF VAR. IT HAS GONE TOOOOOO FAR
Bottle job FC 😂😂😂
Not every team can beat everton 3-1 💀💀
Does Ben Chilwell still feel like they can’t lose?
RIP CHELSEA TITLE HOPES AUGUST - DECEMBER 2020
300m spent and can’t beat Everton. Chelski back at it
Wow Werner is really bad. Wouldn’t have known if he wasn’t on the field the whole game
How can Pickford be chosen for Eng? He seemed very lucky not to let a goal in!
Chelsea hare playin against teams from Liverpool
See comments about chelsea only beating bottom half table teams.  Man Utd *_*.  Arsenal...  Not even sure if they're in the top 10!
Get  in
mendy I think you're playing the wrong sport mate
Was gonna say proud to be blue but then I realised wait were both blues lol😀😀
I feel like havertz for £70+mil isn’t talked about enough. Before people come at this, i do believe hes a class player but I don’t think he was ready for this move yet. 2 more seasons in bundesliga then he should have got his big money move. Poor recruitment from Chelsea.
Oh Chelsea Chelsea Chelsea...😂😂😂😂
Man of the match goes to Everton's goal posts.
LOL
how did mount miss that all he had to do was hit the target goalie and everything was off he's line
Tottenham definitely look like the best team in London,Liverpool's real challengers I think
WOW! Everton won a match, this really is a strange season
btw guys if you didn’t know, john abrahams account got banned so he’s now called andy goldstein, SHOW SOME LOVE FOR MY MAN
So, no one's gonna talk about Pickford's tip onto the post, no? He's erratic, admittedly, but he's capable of some brilliant saves.
COYS 🔵⚪️🔵⚪️
Pickfords decision making really makes you wonder how low his IQ really is, he's completely stupid.
Lool
We should have won this. Hit the post twice. Lost by a penalty. We had no wingers as there all injured, to the extent that we played Tammy as a RightWing.
I'm always gonna support Lampard and Chelsea but surely Frank has realised That our Germans don't work on the wings, we need to go back to the Southampton game where we played a 4-2-3-1 with Havertz as Central CAM with Werner just infront, that worked goalwise, we did draw 3-3 however Now that our defence is sorted and we have a competent GK we need to start playing Werner and Havertz in their natural positions with pulisic/mount on the left and ziyech/CHO on the right with kante and kova in the midfield, we got unlucky today fair play to Everton
One of the deadest Saturday's in the Prem. This game and Manchester derby both absolute snooze-fests. 5 goals in 4 games
Pickford acc did well for once. And dcl didn’t score for once. What a backwards day
Allan. What a player.
Hahaha lollll
If Kepa did what Mendy did, we would never hear the end of it.
The bad Liverpool under Klopp in 17/18 never lost 1-0 they do lose like 2-1, 3-2 and so forth cos we had the front 3 a sub-par Midfield and a shocking Defense.
Stop crying Frank Lampard
Me: *Sees Chelsea lose* *Rages* Also me: *I guess it's time to wear my Bayern Jersy* *Finds out Bayern Drew 1-1* My mind Be like: JSIO AWHD WAIODA
I feel we are gonna win the league
chelsea really do pick their keepers
Chelsea were by far the better side in this match, they weren’t just lucky.
The spirit of Kepa took over Mendy smh
So far Everton have kept 2 clean sheets this season against Chelsea and Spurs...
This was a really entertaining game
Chelsea indeed have top top players but this  man  Lampard  schooled time and time again by Carlo Ancelotti Jurgen Klopp  Jose Mourinho and the list go one. He will never ever become a great coach he is  right now a mediocre coach in charge of a great team sad.
Everton looked class tonight
Imagine wasting time after 20th minute  Dirty tactics by Everton despite being better team today Would be surprised not to see one of the defenders playing for England in Euros
HAHAHAHAHAHA LETS ALL LAUGH AT CHELSEA 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Pickford and Everton back four was brilliant tonight more of the same please
Werner trash not a natual goalscorer good player but Chelsea signed him to score havertz not on it no intensity hopefully will start showing his true qualities asap
Chelsea's new signings have done sod all, their youngsters and old team is carrying them
We just about held on. But a win is a win !
Penalty would have been retaken regardless of a miss. Mendy was like 2 foot off his line.
Hope your all having a great day, Would really appreciate checking out our channel and subbing to us, many thanks
Chelsea’s greatest weakness is Scousers, apparently.
It’s almost Christmas and Chelsea still haven’t beaten a team above 13th. 😂
Chelsea fans really needed this humbling
Nice. Chelsea dropping points
Everton really needed a win like this after their recent form, as for my Chelsea let’s put this behind and go again next fixture and win it
Chelsea should've won.
dont get me wrong timo is a great player, but his finishing is horrible...
good to see pickford improving and growing in confidence
Let's not forget the fact this is chealse's first loss since September.
Pickford is just shocking and he’s England nunber 1 must be southgates son
What a save from Pickford to tip James' shot onto the post mind 👌
This League Season will either be the most forgettable or the strangest season ever.
Good opportunity for Liverpool and Spurs to open up a gap tomorrow with this & the City result.
What happened to all these goals that were flying in before this weekend   5 goals in  4 games 😳 When it used to be double figures
7-2-1 formation.... proper Italian job from ancolotti. Proper embarrassment aswell.
I hate how scoring a 22nd min pen and parking the bus for the whole game wins you matches
As what I can see Pickford seems to be coming out of that rough patch
This trolls are so stupid
Chelsea haven't beaten a top 10 Premier league side yet this season. Its December.
Well  done  Everton  carlo  Ancelotti
WE LOVE YOU EVERTON WE DO  WE LOVE YOU EVERTON WE DO  OH EVERTON WE LOVE YOU
Only Everton could draw against Burnley then beat Chelsea
Ugh we tried but nothing came out of it
The only troll I actually like is the Jose one lol. All the other ones are just sad people
Why does Pickford look like Aitch 😂
Chelsea fans: "18 gAmEs UnDeFeaTeD in oPen pLaY"
And chelsea thought they will win the league 😂😂. No chance, brought right back down to earth ;)
First time in the premier league that Chelsea have lost a game that mendy has been goalkeeper in 😳
early
Let’s all laugh at Chelsea 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Poor performance. Like I’ve said, in the final third we lack ideas. All these flinging in crosses in the box is predictable. Everton were daring us to cross. How can we not score vs Everton? That’s their first clean sheet since match day 1.
Kudos to Everton for holding on.
Finally finally we can see an Angry Rantman rant
Sky with that sigurdson spelling
The most undeserved win ever
Player: gets stabbed to death   Var: he was offside nothing we can do.
I love Sigurosson
Both Merseyside teams are Chelsea’s kryptonite this season
We had a lot of chance mannnnn
Lets goooo
*Sigurosson*  🙄
Haha classic Chelsea cant even beat Everton
de gea: im so bad at goalkeeping at the moment kepa: you think youre the worst? have u seen my stupid errors? mendy: hold my goalie gloves
You spelt his name wrong good old sky sports
Mendy got possessed by kepa
Chelsea haven't beaten a team currently in the top half of the table
F u Everton
Pickford actually played good today
Havertz the most overrated player in the prem
That's Mendy first mistake
People who were early enough for the title to say Sigurosson🤣 👇🏾
Didn't expect that congrats Everton
Harvertz needs to be dropped asap it's slightly killing chelsea, he's to slow on recovery and his passing is off
This is what happens when you have no proper wingers available...
Banter fc
Ronaldo is the best ever
If ur team has conceded  5 or more prem goals in one match this season please think before you troll
This game showed the flaws that still remain in this Chelsea team and it's why they won't win the league this year
Fun fact: Sigurdsson has scored more goals against Chelsea than any other squad in his career, with 6.
It's impossible to do predictions in 2020-2021......
can't wait to see Rory Jennings reaction to this
Shocking match for chelsea🔵🔵😭😭😭
The bigger club with more league titles won🤣🤣 Chelsea scum will forever be a small club 👋👋
Well that was as tame as a pussy
Like how we played 4 centre backs and still frauded a win.
I have to say our response after going behind was amazing, unlucky.... COYB
Of course Skys quick when we lose
I swear everytime Chelsea go to Goodison Park, we forget how to play football
Sigurdsson's name is spelt wrong it the title!😂😂😂
Just not good enough today, well played Everton, deserved it more. We need to sign a winger in January.
I still don't know how Tottenham are top of the prem 😭😭
United beat Everton and we’re the banter club apparantly....
what was mendy thinking?
😫😫😫 lost to our rivals everton poor chelsea
Messed up the title yet again sky😂
First
It’s nearly Christmas and chelsea still haven’t beaten a team above 13th 😂😂😂
Mendy really has filled kepas boots
Props to Sky for getting the highlights here so quick.
What a win utft coyb 🔵🔵🔵🔵
Embarrassing from chelsea
What a result for Everton! Should restore their confidence and now they can kickstart their season!
Every result this season has been a surprise
Spelt it wrong
Havertz has done nothing for Chelsea so far. Flop of the Summer.
As a spurs fan I'm happy Chelsea lost
Haverts isn’t really good is he lads 😭
As soon as i saw the notification i got excited
Chelsea haven’t beaten a top 10 side yet and I’m supposed to believe they’re Pl and UCL contenders....
Chelsea will crumble. Carry on...
First
Just shows how fans make a difference 👍
Evertonnnnn ima chelseaa fann 💙💙
Our second lost of the season 😢 💔
Need to find other sources of goals
3rd
Chelsea have failed to beat a top 10 team this season. Put Lampard on fraud watch, along with havertz and that Bart Simpson that they have in goal..........
Everton back in the title race.......
YAY
Really hope Tottenham lose tomorrow
Esrly
