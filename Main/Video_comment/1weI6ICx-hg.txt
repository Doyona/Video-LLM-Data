The face Camilla and Charles is disgusted me. He doesn’t represent or hold a title as a prince even a King!disgusting 🤢
Diana is super dead right now 😂😂😂😂
1:53 TITANIC
I'm Okey. It just it all been mad recently...
Well.. no comments...
I'm a late comer to The Crown, just now in season 2. The episodes that discuss colonialism of other countries and the plotting to maintain control is cringe. It's definitely helping me to understand history better.
Its warth watching show or not ?
I can't believe they used 2Wei's "Mad World." Amazing, it fits Diana's situation perfectly in a way. Absolutely cinematic. I can't believe no one noticed.
NETFLIX wants yacht woman markel, cancel your MEMBERSHIP.  WE DID & ARE HAPPIER THAN EVER
Diana a kind caring compassionate human who is the queen of hearts and my idol taken from us too soon rip you beautiful soul
But I felt like The Crown Series potrayed Diana's demeanor as weird and that she was the reason for what happened. The whole Diana character felt shady and depressed in the series, like she was trying to seek attention but in Reality she was the complete opposite and Strong and nonchalant in whatever happened in her Personal Life. Anyone agree?.
The acting is superior, but let’s not forget the propaganda they have pushed to make certain people look as a hero when we know they are the masters of the design for the outcome of this woman’s short lived life to produce 2 children and afterwards discarded by a system of Evil!!
Lady Di always looked so sad and Elizabeth Debicki just captured this so well.
Watch "Dil hai Tumhara" hindi movie.  Camilla as prety zinta Diana as Mahima Charles as Arjun. Rekha as the QUEEN Climax will GIVE YOU THE ANSWER. she dating another man was not wrong, but she should have asked charles to marry camilla FIRST, after giving her kids to the Queen,  and then dated whoever she was in love with.
1:06 can someone please tell the soundtrack
Diana look like Paris Hilton
I'm already crying... and it's only the trailer
So brave, Diana, so very,  very brave. Btw, does anyone bother to mention the fact that she-the divorced mother of two boys-and she alone, informed that pap who took “the kiss” photo, as to exactly when and where she’d be in the middle of the med, whilst carrying her cross on her latest boyfriend’s yacht?
Hi.  I'm Rose prince Harry's wife.   My husband won't be having group sex with you all ever again and please do not contact him hereafter.  And everyone in this video.
This whole Diana story is overrated.  Diana was NO ANGEL.  STOP making her look so innocent.  She just fooled the people but undermined the RF. She was a misfit from the start. Giddy headed fool. Miss goodie 2 shoes had more love affairs than her trashy prince Charles.
What if Princess Diana is the antichrist.
😢😢😢
Nothing but tears stream down my eyes.... My heart is devoured in sadness every single time I watch The Beloved Late Princess... Her gentleness.... Her  heart brimming with benevolence and compassion.... She yearned for "True Love"... A wish which remained unfulfilled till the very last breath of Her Life.... The BELOVED LATE QUEEN'S words "All one wants is that girl to find peace"... I could feel the sadness in HER voice.... The Late Princess 's wish may have remained unfulfilled...but She carved out a place in the hearts of billions of people who remember her... Love her and Adore her even years after her untimely demise.... ❤️❤️❤️❤️
She brought back Diana to life
What a troll Camilla is, like a common tart hanging around.
8 months later watching Diana tearing up breaks my heart. most people watching this can feel her pain from this powerful scene. Seeing Diana's ghost is something else which words cannot comprehend. To generation too young to understand her while she was alive and the generation after her life will truly remember and appreciate her now
"Car accident."
Never met but yes I'm crying when she announced died🥲
احسد كل من ما شاف هذا العمل القوي
oh, dear ! That fragile princess was all about whining and complaining  in the public eye and having fun with boys in her real life and living  a lavish  way of life in her real life,  how great!
The series is generally wonderful, revealing complex life and scenes, behind the walls of those palaces and the family and won the admiration of many
Unwanted fame…
Ma in italiano?
What that is song?
Papy bertahsn
Does anyone know the name of the song?
Why does she look like umbridge from harry potter 😂
Is this not Professor Unbridge
I'll never forget that night, ever.  When the reports started coming in, they said she was in an accident, then went about evening, thinking "hope she doesn't land in the hospital".  After a few more scattered reports we finally heard those words "Princess Diana has died".  Time stopped, the world stopped.  How... it was just a little accident, this can't be really happening.  Devasting.
This series was such a moving one for me. I’ve always admired and respected the monarchy with a special love for Diana and admiration for Queen Elizabeth II. The mantle she inherited at such a young age and not being able to enjoy her youth and marriage was a heavy burden and sad to see. But her commitment to duty and protocol humbled me and put into perspective that sometimes life is not always fair, but our decisions rest on something bigger than ourselves.  Being able to see the inner mechanisms of how “The Firm” works and the beauty of the palaces and the landscape of Scotland, stag hunting, the Queen’s love and breadth of knowledge for breeding and raising race horses was something I didn’t know and fun to see and was an amazing thing to watch. The dichotomy between both worlds, duty, how one parents, stiff upper lip of being British compared to emotion and feelings was interesting to see how both worlds were coming together and have their respective places in the world as it becomes more modern, but, one should not forget traditions, family, duty, rules, accountability and responsibilities. There was so much to unpack from this series and explained so much.  Whether there are inaccuracies or not; for the most part a lot of this is based on facts. Kudos to all the actors who did such a magnificent job in bringing the Royal Family to life.  I have even more contempt for Meghan Markle for breaking the relationship between Willam and Harry whose bond was their mother. There were so many ways she could have done this differently. At least Harry did not come with the baggage his father came with in dating and being married to his mother. Her lack of commitment to understanding tradition, respect, value for family, duty, responsibilities and accountability is quite evident and says a lot.
She looks just like her and talks like her. She is just beautiful, like Diana....❤❤❤❤....
Britains most dysfunctional family. Always has been, and always will be! 😅
Western Dead soul of looters never get peace in hell 😂
I want the director of “THE CROWN” to make a series about “THE KENNEDY’S” next!
Dominic West was too good looking to play Prince Charles.
It was of course reasonable for Diana to figure into Season 6 of The Crown. That said, she dominates the narrative so completely in the first four episodes that they should have, by rights, been titled "The Diana". The pacing and the character segregation was done admirably well during Seasons 1-5, which made the tunnel vision-focus of those first four episodes in the 6th seem like the side was being let down a bit. There was more to the royal family than just the shitshow that was the Charles and Diana Chronicles.   The remaining six episodes of the series restored the narrative flow well enough, with the final episode of the series being very tastefully done.
I’ve been watching it all I can say is the royal family has to be one of the most dysfunctional families on earth .
Wow she plays DIana so well..
Song name?
Thank you netflix for one of if not the best show I ever seen I’m a black male and I cried when Diana died the show is so well written and the actors are s tier please make a season 7 continue the queen has passed and I believe this show deserves a final season with her passing at least
They should do how prince harry met and married megab. That'll be far more interesting
Great adaptation truly plays the role with conviction ❤
name of the song?
Excellent ax
Anyone know who the artist is covering Mad World? Thanks in advance 😇
They used 2wei mad world cover
I dint think there is a single sympathetic character amongst the lot of them.
I'm convince now she was killed. She was being played by two men who wanted to rise to the highest level of British society.
The most depressing final season. One hit after another.
She looks Lady Gaga 😮
They broke that poor girl down one tear at a time, gaslighting her pain and loneliness at every turn, and set her careening down the path that would end her life.
It's absolutely a major distraction having a 6 foot 3 in woman playing a person who was only 5 ft 10 in . She towers over the rest of the cast and the difference is so badly noticed
Princess Diana *
I’m watching the crown again. I’m in the sixith season, but I’m noticing in the 4th, 5th and 6th season they (the spin doctor, charles, palace staff) all refer to camilla , even after the divorce (I don’t know about after charles and camilla’s wedding) they refer to her as Mrs. Parker-Bowles or Mrs. PB………it’s creepy. Charles in season 4, I want to schedule some time away with Mrs. Parker-Bowles, and it’s his wedding anniversary. The Spin doctor and Charles calling her Mrs. PB or Mrs. Parker-Bowles……I get ick cause they are trying to g to make her more palatable to the politics but keep referring to her by Parker-Bowles which only reminds people she had an affair.
Just watched series 6. Absolute garbage and amazing that people watch this rubbish. Apart from all the actual errors the acting was appalling. Imelda Staunton may be a good comedian but her resemblance to Queen Elizabeth was non existent and surely someone could have straightened that dreadful wig. Rubbish from beginning to end.
No Diana don’t get killed by paparazzi i wan’t you to be queen
Time to abolish this outdated monarchy with a bloody past. And teach the cruel colonial history to British kids in schools. The current king's mother ,the so-called 'Queen' left behind a legacy of denial of treacherous plunder from nations, killing of innocent, unarmed civilians through inhuman laws and staying defiant on the crimes against humanity that her Empire perpetrated. She had 70 years to openly repent for their actions, but never once did I hear I'm sorry, or please forgive us, not once. She also had all the time in the world to return some or all of the stolen stones and artifacts from Africa and Indian subcontinent but never did. The torture, and  Mutilation of people in the colonies can never be forgotten, or forgiven. She must be remembered in the light of her greedy, selfish actions and not some romanticized, redundant title. May those who perished because of her family's greed find peace. May humanity be spared from such characters in future.
William saying "Mummy" broke me. Knowing we haven't heard him (or Harry) say that in over 25 years 😢😢
aaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhh the tv reason she got killed off...taller than her tv husband
These episodes are slow, boring, dragged out, and obvious.
Brilliant series...a masterpiece
Music: Mad World
I love Imelda as the Queen 😍
keep the forefinger on her lips press them. hail the lord!
If anything in this series is remotely fact it is thee sickest display of self righteous manipulation pissy drunk with power in human history its absolutely insane and sickening how the elite play real life chess with the lives of real people and even their own family truly disgusting ……. But kudos to all the actresses and actors who did a stellar job of portraying their characters it was a masterclass in acting and deserve every top award in their field
Das Drehbuch zu dieser Staffel ist einfach nuch schlecht! Charles- hier die Heiligkeit in Person....in Wirklichkeit nicht im Stande die Familie zusammen zu halten.
Who else is here after watching Nicki Minaj on her Joe Biden interview saying she watches this show lol
Why was it such a big deal when Diana was dating someone when Charles was living with Camilla? It was like when they divorced he was allowed to do whatever but she was supposed to stay in a bubble . Talk about double standards
🌞
speak from your eyes. hail the lord!
She was too tall and skinny to play Dianna .
Do these people realize its a drama made up from events and blown up its BOT A REAL DOCUMENRARY
I have just watched season 6 and it is excellent some really funny scenes from margaret loved it now I think I'll start from season one and watch it right through
It's just soo wrong in many ways.
We've reached the end.
Im crying so bad.🥲🥹
Diana was no Margaret.
Una historia interesante para ver sobre la princesa Diana
I wept for Diana .The kind of neglect and suffering from the age of nineteen.It’s unbelievable.Thank you Netflix for this series.It’s the pro monarchist who is main culprits.
Imma skip the other seasons but thos one imma watch
The day Diana died i was at Kualalumpur Airport. Never forget the day . Elizabeth and Emma have done brilliant job. Season 6 episode 4 is very emotional.
Si el trailer estuvo así no me esperaba a ce la película completa se ve que va a estar muy interesante
When i heard the crown will include princess Diana i knew this will start to be akward in regards to her relationship with royal family, of course as expected she was portrayed unstable and family is loving and supportive blah blah. Dodi is some sort of the scammer and used her loooool. Everyone knows that royals were involved in her death and it's cringe to watch it otherwise. Writers had no choice cuz it's a very delicate situation. Production and cast and everything was a masterpiece no doubt,  but it's obviously this was forced to make royals look great and not involved in any way which is just a huge amount of lies.

Muy buena serie
Muy buena temporada, recomendado para todos
After watching the last season I have the feeling that these series were made to paint the royal family white…to show that they are humane. I don’t know, still find what Charles did to Diana very sad. As well as how princess Margareth was treated by the family very disappointing.
Muy buena serie, muy interesante e integrante. Espero con ansias verla
Charles, cheater & wef crook!
Hermosa película vale la pena cada minuto
La espero con ansias de verdad será de otro nivel 🎉
Por lo que se ve, muy interesante la veré!!
Esta temporada sera magnifica y le encantara a la audiencia de netflix sera de lo mejor para todos los que ven esta serie
Been a fan of The Crown and also, the real British Royal Family for a very long time, I never knew that I'd cry buckets of tears in The Crown Season 6 Part 1, Episode 4 when Princess of Wales, Lady Diana had passed away.   As far as I remember, I grew up knowing about her, and to someone who bear the same name, she's been one of the largest influences I've had. I've always researched about her life. Anyway, I may have been too young when she passed away (1997) but all I can say, that was how strong her influence was. Even in death, her legacy and life will always be able to change people's lives. Her legacy will stay now with the two boys she had left behind...   I totally want to recommend this dramatized documentary about the British Royal Family.
Was Elizabeth Lady Diana's reincarnation????
Guena
Una historia triste entretenida con un fondo de música que lo hace interesante para seguir mirándole muy recomendable para verlo dónde es a lo que pasa en la realidad  se las recomiendo
Tiene tanta similitud con la princesa Diana...
Muy buena película, tan parecida cn la realidad
Hermosa película gran coincidencia con la realidad muy hermosa recomendable para cualquiera
El casting de esta serie es impresionante todos son muy buenos
Esto tienes que verlo, no te lo pierdas
Es algo muy increíble los parecido de los actores a los de la realidad sinceramente está película es increíblemente asombrosa💪💪💪💪✨✨✨✨
I just caught up from mid season 5. 😭 smh unbelievable writing, performances. I’m stunned.
Excelente trailer, me gustó mucho, queremos otro adelanto
Wow me dió escalofríos solo al ver el tráiler,😮ya quiero ver la segunda parte 😊
Por fin otra temporada 😊😊😊 me encanta
Me parece una película muy interesante sobre varias problemáticas
Es increíble lo mucho que Elizabeth se parece a Diana en algunas tomas. Por un momento piensas que es realmente ella. Elizabeth merece un Globo de Oro a la Mejor Actriz.
Very good movie and you see very moving
Trailer interesante y entretenido que bien que Netflix saque trailers así de emocionantes
Es impresionante como cada actor se parece al personaje que interpreta .😊
El sonido esta buenos los actores de primera muy bien
A good film ❤
Algo esperado la gran película y biografía dónde se habla de la vida de la princesa diana
Exelente filmación 🎉 una des las mejores 😊
La mejor serie para los amantes de los dramas historicos
lovely, however it's empty
Es impresionante como Elizabeth se parece tanto a diana, en muchos momentos pienso que es ella en realidad
Me encanta ver la historia de la corona inglesa … impresionante
Interesante vi 2 capitulos
La temporada que todos anhelamos! 🎉
I've always liked and was inspired by British royalty. If you want to understand it and comprehend better. Watch this series. ❤❤
Esta buenisima siempre las mejorrs peliculas series en netflix 😊
This show is fabulous!  The way it's put together, the acting...I love it.  Just started binging it so I have a ways to go, but that's ok because it is Sooo good. 🍿🎥🎬
Spoiler alert:  The first 4 episodes were mid af
Diana is truly the main character.
We’re living this movie as I speak through text. If you can’t see it yet, you will.
But of course netflix aired this after the death of dodis father so they could completely blame them w no repercussions.smdh. it was absolutely disgusting! .
It's very funny and creepy that they think they should deserved that type of attention and the wealthy life after colonizing multiple countries I don't think they deserved
Had that moment of tears watching S6 E4. Didn’t you?
Do we know if at any point they are going to recreate when Prince Harris was naked in Vegas with those girls?👀
I didn’t watch all the crown seasons I just watched parts where diana on it even I skipped all the conversations too. the crown 6 so heartbreaking for me to remember. that even when Diana passed away😢Elizabeth Debicki did an amazing job portraying her. forever I will Hate Charles Camilla and Elizabeth who failed to educate her son to respect his wife. I hope they will got the punishment they deserve after life. For Diana I hope you rest in peace and joy in heaven
If only, she had a peaceful life, away from the prying eyes... However, who am I to tell, I am watching her stories even 26 years after her death!
This take me back to 1997 in tears again 😭
Diana Mosley I am guessing? Wonder where she got that last name from...
i know most people hates the diana/dodi ghost scenes but i think its a very beautiful idea and has such a bigger meaning to it. its like her comfort or pain is always with them but when the queen looked over thinking to see her ghost but she wasnt there i guessed symbolised she has finally made peace and will rest in peace forever and for everyone to move on with the grief and not hold back
A disappointment to be honest, could have easily done the funeral in one episode
Gott wie konnte dieser Charles seine Frau von Anfang an betrügen,, So ein Gottloser Mensch .. Er ist für mich der Schuldige und diese Ehebrecherin Camilla .. Bin zutiefst erschüttert über die Vorgehensweise der Britischen Herrschaft .. Verlogen bis zum geht nicht mehr 😡 Bete für Prinzessin Diana .🕯🙏❤️
Diana's death was shown so beautifully
It must be noted how Elizabeth Debicki looks more like Diana than Diana itself.
Disappointing season, untrue and biased!!!
Now don't forget none of us knows what really went on behind the scenes. The writers of this show were very clever at pulling at the heart strings where the royal family are concern. Especially Charles. I'll never forget, nor forgive. RIP Princess Diana.
Oh SO haunting .. Elizabeth Debicki is exactly like the beautiful and late Diana Princess of Wales.. Rest in peace beautiful Princess
So this  season was to pander to Charles  and Camilla and blame Alfayed  for the death of Diana.
Last episode.. did he really tell william that they're crying about him and harry and not for diana... idk.. that sounded evil
Most of it is pure fiction and BS. But the memory of that night waiting for news and then the announcement made me cry yet again. Nearly 30 years later.
The corvus crow assasins creed situation? 😂
Casting and everything is good except for trying to make Charles appear as a saint! It is obvious that the establishment killed Diana in order to ensure Charles and Camilla get married and make their path to the monarchy clearer.
There are some still photos of Elizabeth next to Diana where you honestly cannot tell the difference.  Now THAT is good casting!!!
Miss Debicki is really THAT actress
Amazing!😊
Im amazed how this cast is all superb in their acting skills! AMAZING!!!
To those who love  historical dramas, I recommend you try out "The Crown". In short, it portrayed the British monarchy, weaving historical events with personal narratives. The production quality is extraordinary, with amazing navigation on the complexities of power, duty, and personal life within the royal family across different eras. The series offers a insight on the challenges faced by the monarchy, showcasing the human side of historical figures while providing a compelling narrative of British history. Credits to Neflix on this masterpiece, it's definitely one of my favorites❤
Baya güzel 😂❤
Imedla Staunton is a fantastic choice for an older Elizabeth.
Neu reiche !!! Best Komödie!
A masterpiece
What a bunch of lies, they tried to deceive us about some characters and events in this season. But, going through the comments, it seems everybody knows the truth .
The fragility
She looks so much like Diana
Çok iyi mutlaka izlenmesi lazım
Good
harika
Good
sondtrack name?
Harika bir film, büyük bir heyecanla izliyorum Netflix şimdiye kadarki en iyi dizi platformu olmaya devam edecek
I started watching this and Im getting all little disappointed/angry  I'm on 4s and they make like Diana was a spoiled nagging wife😤 just because she no longer with us they shouldn't have been allowed to portray her like that. 😔 And they make Charles like the innocent one😡🤨 they completely switched the characters up and that broad Camilla is a has been married once or twice 🤷🏽‍♀️ Camilla shand parker bowls. Ugh idk if I can finish this series🤔🇺🇸
I cries when she died. SHE WAS THE BEST OF THE ROYAL FAMILY
Diana 😢😢🥺🥺☹️😞
Versão distorcida  Essa mulher adorava estar na mídia, nos jornais em tudo Acostumou-se a ser o centro das atenções  Mostram uma mudança pra Santa na hora da morte
That's gonna be very emotional why couldn't they leave her alone
We want Shadow and Bones back
This season was done specifically to whitewash the royal family and make Dodi and Diana appear as weak people and everyone controls them, but to be honest, they killed them.
Song ???
I resent how this series tries to paint Charles in a sympathetic remorseful light. They even cast a handsome actor to play him because they want people to find him more appealing than he is.
First off, Netflix, should be ashamed of themselves for Allowing this Lie and Peter Morgan should NEVER be allowed to write another piece, the Level of Disrespect is beyond Belief, Morgan was honored by Charlie The Man Child not so long ago, so just like the UK Media, he was Bought to Lie to Make Charlie and his Mistress Wifey, and that Bull$hit that man has put on the screen is Unbelievable and most Sickening and that man needs to take himself back to the Hole he climbed out of! What that person doesn’t realize is Many Many of us watched it All play out, millions of us, like myself have read many Books and watched Countless Documentaries about Charlie and CowMilla’s Despicable Behavior towards Prince Diana, it was Appalling and downright Disrespectful to Prince Harry’s Mum. How dare that Stupid man, Morgan making Diana the Villain in this Piece of Absolute Trash that Morgan the Bought Man wrote has, did that Disrespectful man do any research, because if he did, he would have found the Truth, it’s ALL out there. I hope the Good folks of the World that followed Princess Boycott those Crap Lies, this piece of Nonsense was written to Bring up Charlie The Man Child and his Mistress Wifey, CowMilla’s and to make them into something they Were Not, Kind, Caring, those two Evil Creatures tortured Princess Diana from the age of 18 years old, they Plotted against her, The day before Charlie’s wedding to Diana per his Man Servant, those Creatures slept together the night together in the palace and does anyone recall the Train incident where Charlie was seen boarding it with a Blond woman and it wasn’t Diana, and Diana said so, it was that Cow, CowMilla’s and there Sycophant friends would offer those two Creatures there homes and they would vacation with the same friends behind Diana’s Back. When Charlie divorced Diana he Stripped her of the HRH even though she was the Mum of a further king, Willy, they took her Protection away and yes she never wanted Charlie’s palace protection because they reported Everything that Princess Diana did back to Charlie and because she had no protection she was taken Out in a Tunnel!!! If Princess Diana was still alive, what you see today, (Con-A-Nation) setting Charlie’s Mistress Wifey on the throne, that would Never have happened and Charlie and The World who followed Princess Diana and Her suffering by the Hands of Her then husband, Charlie, we can’t forget the fact that the then queen, Elizabeth as She new Everything about what those two Creatures we’re putting Diana threw and She did Nothing to Stop it in fact when she first heard about the accident and Diana wasn’t declared dead yet she said, (Someone must have Cut the Brakes) she didn’t miss Our Beloved Princess Diana what’s so ever and her Written Speech tells us that! Life in The UK 🇬🇧 would have been so so Different and Wonderful for not just the Charities Diana Helped but The World in general. Charlie Trust is Laundering Foreign Billionaires so then can become Citizens and Possibly get Pinned with one of those Worthless Metals that Charlie and the palace laughingly hand out!!! Watching the crown was a Dirty Joke and there’s a Special Place in Hell for people like Peter Morgan and any others that are Deep C & C Sycophants and who Twist the Truth, better yet, Down Right Lie to Get in Favor or to Stay in Favor and Keep Silent about the Truth!?!? All I can say is, it’s a Shame that This Writer had to Lie on the Backs of a Dead Princess to be Pinned, Morgan is on the Wrong Side of History and History is on the side of Truth and in this case, it’s Princess Diana, NOT Charlie and The Mistress Wifey, CowMilla’s, regardless of this Farce written by Morgan, the Shame of that Lier, Truth Twister! Karma comes for us All and it will show up in Charlie’s and CowMilla’s life but ForSure in Morgan’s for Perpetrating the Lie that he was Allowed to put on the screen. In the End, if You haven’t seen The Crown, Don’t Bother, it is Full of Nothing but Lies and Mistruths and Targeting a Long Since Dead Woman, so like I said, for the folks like me that kept up with Princess Diana and her life battling against the Sycophants that Pushed Charlie’s Narrative…
Bolland, Charles former spin doctor,  was also accused of leaking negative stories about British royal family members, with Sholto Byrnes writing in a 2005 article in The Independent that 'By making Charles's family look bad, it was said, he made Charles and Camilla look good in comparison.'
Prince Charles employed a ruthless p.r. man who callously threw his sons under a double-decker bus and besmirched Princess Diana in a desperate effort to burnish his own sullied reputation, according to a new report.  A BBC documentary says a Charles aide spearheaded a brutal media operation that exploited Prince Harry’s drug problems and leaked personal information about Prince William, the Daily Beast reported. It was not clear whether Charles had direct involvement in the scandal, detailed in the documentary “Reinventing the Royals". Charles’ alleged henchman, Mark Bolland, employed a scorched-earth campaign to manipulate the press and turn his beleaguered boss into a sympathetic public figure.
Carolyn Robb, who worked for the Prince of Wales for 16 years from 1989 claimed that Charles's mistress (as Camilla was still known) had held a luncheon on the very day of Diana's funeral, Saturday 6th September 1997: "I'd cooked for the Duchess before and it had never bothered me, but it felt very strange to be preparing meals for her in the kitchen at St James's Palace while the Princess's body was lying in state next door". There were people signing the book of condolence on the other side and there I was, preparing a lunch for the Duchess. She didn't tell me any details. I knew she was entertaining friends because I made nice food". Vile woman.
Çok güzel bir dizi hiç bir sezonu kaçırmadan izlemenizi tavsiye ederim. 👌
Heartbreaking Season..,
Interesting
Dear Netflix, did the british royal family write the screen play for this season themselves? Unbelievably disappointing propaganda for Charles and Camilla! And you didn't pick up any evidence (of letting Diana willingly die after the accident) there is surrounding her death. Just say you had no freedom in doing this season and there for you shouldn't have realised it!
Shame they didn’t tell the real truth but I doubt the royalists would believe it anyway. Poor Diana she never stood a chance with that family.
In my opinion, the casting for the last season was completely wrong. The actress playing the queen, otherwise a good actress, gave a pale queen. The sparrow from GoT as Philip, just next to it. No bite, no humor, acting like an extra. the Queen Mother, tall and gaunt, completely out of place. Only Diana was a good cast. She has mastered Diana's stupid, naive look perfectly. In the end it became mystical, Diana as a ghost. You have to get to that first.
The only thing I took from this first part was I’m glad Megan go out and is safe.
Çok güzel
The day Diana died, my parents had their wedding. They didn’t find out she died until the reception. Now every year they try and celebrate their union, they’re reminded of their favourite princess dying
Elizabeth did a great job even if the show is largely fiction.
Spoiler. She dies.
It will help us to have an engaging experience that we will greatly enjoy watching.
Çok harika bir film  izlemeyi tavsiye ederim
Kadının kendi oyunculuğu hep bu oyun için saklamış gibi
Not really enjoying it… Feels like everyone is over acting!
Çok güzel bir platform
Selam macera ve gizemli bir film
İts perfect
This is so inaccurate and wrong. Princess Dianna was a Black man.
I always thought royal family was responsible for her death until I realised it was completely the paparazzi. A hate story gossip scandal is their bread and better the press the media and people who will come at me saying they treat the royal family differently no they don’t Charles is the most hated person and media hasn’t been any kind to him either whatever happened between Charles Diana and Camilla is their personal matter and they are entitled to their own choices absolutely we have no right to comment on any  one their character.
Probably not my most favourite season as the first two were epic BUT…Elizabeth as Diana is just FLAWLESS and PERFECTION. I had to remind myself that she’s not the real princess Di at times.
Justice for shadow and bone
I call B.S. on charles break down when Diana was killed by disgusting paparazzi.  Id he actually did that, it was only because he knew someone could either hear or see him. He never loved or even cared about Diana. Ever. And if you read Harrys book Spare, you will know that Harry didnt cry when his mom died,  and that actually worried him through his year's, why he couldnt cry. He cried many many years after her death. This is the worst season. Of course charles becomes king and now has a say. Queen Elizabeth had a huge say in this series. charles will make himself look like a saint and none of the stories will be true. They never claimed the entire series was true, but The Queen tried as hard as she could for accuracy.  Now its just another b.s. netdlix show.
Oh I hope Meghan Markle is in this season so she can tell us how hard her life is. I can’t wait to hear all about it.
Damn. Not me tearing up
The More This Woman Was Stepping Back, The More Criminals Were Stepping Further.  It Is Disgusting The Way This Woman Have Been Treated By The Herd Of Nobody Zombies. And Even More Twisted, As This Woman Have Been Involved Into Humanity Campaigns And Got Only Chaos In Return.  This Is The Reality, The Criminals Have Been Jumping All Over The Places On This Beautiful Woman.  When A Woman Is Avoiding Directly Eye Contact And Even Is Pointing Herself Head Down Or In The Opposite Direction, This Is An Obvious Sign That Herself It Is Just Not Willingly To Have Any Sort Of Approaching With A Criminal.  This Attitude Of Pushing The Boundaries In This Manner, On Someone, Is Taken By The Already Convicted Men Who Are Rapists, And For The Women Is Applying As Well, To The Extent That The Woman Had Experiencing Rape And Wants The Same Pain To Be Experienced By The Other Woman.  Regarding Kids And Teenagers, This Kind Of Criminal Chasing Is Mostly Relate To Jealously, Attitude Borrowed From Their -B-e-l-l-o-w-e-d-  Bonkers Parents, Or Other Insane Adults Around.  For Myself The Imagine Of This Woman Is Alike A Piece Of Meat Just Thrown In The Middle Of A Stable Packed Within Dogs Used For Fight Activities.  There Is Forgiveness, Whatsoever, For What Exactly Happened To This Woman.
Excellent final season!
Canceled Signature! BS just BS! Awfull! They blamed her death on the Al Fayed family the worst way possible!!! False accusations zero evidence. Afraid of the FIRM? There was no need for this storytelling wise...I hope they get sue to Kingdom Come!!!!!
The daily mail will be defining truth from fiction on Nov 19th they report. It's wasn't enjoyable to watch picking and choosing a narrative. I'm glad Dodi father and the late Queen aren't alive to watch.
I started watching season 6 and then shut it off. I don't want to see the details of Diana's death again. Also, every time I see who they cast as Charles, I cringe. Dominic West is WAY too good looking to portray Charles. Elizabeth Debicki does an amazing job as Diana, although her 6'3" height is a bit distracting. Diana was tall, but not that tall.
I was in tears watching both Dodi's father crying and the then Prince Charles. All the walls came down with their loss.
Hope this is the final season for The Crown. They have no respect for those people who are no longer here to defend themselves. The problem is people who are watching this nay think that all these fabricated stories are true.  But at the end of the day, this all comes back to  $$$$$$$$$$.
Just finished the four episodes and can’t believe some here in the comment section are processing Diana’s death at the same time. Truly remarkable!
DIANNA.. IS THAT YOU!
mükkemel bir film
This movie looks great and exciting and there is a lot of mystery in it
I think its genius that they released the 4 eps first to give time for people to process look back reminisce of Diana. People still loved and will always love her.
Harika bir fragman izlerken tüylerim ürperdi
Mükemmel ❤
Harika bir şey gelecek sabırsızlıkla bekliyorum
Nice trailer . Just saw it now Looking good
Just watched season 6 part one and OMG. Elizabeth’s portrayal of Diana is AMAZING. Growing up in the 80s and 90s, Diana being everywhere I had her mannerisms memorized and here she nails em all. I hope she gets an award for this.
They take liberties, but this looks well done. She made such an impact, even my grandparents, who were not celebrity followers whatsoever, kept the Time magazine issue that came out just after she died.
Film çok iyi herkese tavsiye ederim
The casting is perfect.
Brilliant acting.but I can only watch once.
Elizabeth Debicki is incredible! 👏🏻  Cannot wait for part 2!
Its the best
Çok iyi akıcı bir film
mükemmel
How much did the Royal Family pay Netflix for Season 6?  What an ugly picture they painted of Diana and the Fayeds. So Diana was the drama queen for trying to find her happiness? Like she could control the media attention on her? Charles was the ohhh so empathetic one? And the boys being affected by Diana's news in the media. Meanwhile Charles well known affair with Camilla throughout their whole lives was ehh..??? The bias is clear as day, Season 6 is Netflix kicked up the butt to rectify S1 to S5, esp now that Charles is King.  The media would have hounded Diana whether she was with Dodi, an Indian doctor, a Chinese businessman, or Brad Pitt. She had every right to date any race, nationality or religion.  William is King in waiting. He is not gonna speak up for his mother. Its simple, the Royals will do anything and everything to retain their place as THE ROYALS.
Netflix should delete Season 6!!! What a fail!! Netflix was paid by the Royals to make Diana look bad! They are literally deflecting blame to the Arabs lol ( I am not even Arab). Season 6 was supposed to be about the relationship the Queen and Diana had during Diana’s popularity! And how it stressed the royals. What a bogus season! Great job only for the actors
Last episode is disappointed and unbelievable. It seems that there are many modifications
This woman did a fantastic job playing Princess Diana ❤
They all played the part fantastic
0:42 exact chord progression to 'Ride it'
I wept. For Charles, Diana, the princes. The Queen an icon of love. No one is evil in this story. Not Camilla either. Charles was honest always. No blame. I just weep because I miss those gone that were examples for all of us.
MF's Paparazzi ruined her entire life
Elizabeth Debicki portrayed Diana extremely well ❤❤❤❤❤. It’s very emotional for me even just to watch her facial expression. I can’t believe it takes the world so long to find her to play Diana. On the other hand, Kristen Stewart in Spencer 🤮…. That movie caused me traumas seriously!
Wow at times I couldn’t tell difference at times I felt it was Diana.  When she was waiting for the car I was saying don’t go in.  Absolutely amazing
Coming back as a ghost!! WTF!!!
Sad that they didn't use the 'duck shoot' background score this season. Hopefully they end the final episode of the final part with it, and then it will beautifully tie the start of the series and end of the series together. It's so powerful  because even if the first part started with diana's story, it should end with the story of 'The Crown' and that of the queen and no background music is better suited for that than 'duckshoot'.
I mean Diana was huge but they dedicated an entire 4 episode arch of a 10 episode season, and we still have the 2000s and 2010s to cover.
The poor woman, Diana had a lonely chilhood, not loving parents, a cruel stepmother.  She was hunted to marry al older man that had a married mistress since young ,expected to provide heirs and don't complain. The photographers were guilty of her death, it was very convenient  for the Queen, Charles.  I don't believed was investigated properly her death.
Lol it’s like the series started being about the Queen and ended up being all  About Diana
One of her sons is soon going to use this for his publicity lol it’s just sad.
Cok iyi bir fragman  olmuş tam üst kalite izlenebilecek bir seviye film thankyou Netflix
Maybe Princess Diana put a karma to the family for what their royal ancestors did to this world. They owe a lot of things they have ruined from day 1.
I hope they age up the kids for part 2 so we can get Harry the naughty years
“The real Queen 👸 of our hearts 💕♥️.”
Çok güzel bir film herkese öneririm
❤❤❤❤
They did chase Diana like a wounded animal, but she was no wounded animal. The final days of her life I will never forget!
Mükemmel
Just came here to change my up vote to dislike and to say that I hope someone will go to prison for this season.
Coming from someone who lived when all this really happened this feels HIGHLY well done.   And that very last shot, wow.
Sooooo boring! I almost couldn't finish the first episode. Why forcing it?? The first 3 were good, 4th was ok, all the rest are insufferable.
Süper bir film herkesin izlemesin tavsiye ediyorum
I thought the first two seasons excellent but it's gone gradually down hill since and now it's just Hollywoodised drivel.
This script has Harry's name all over it. Also the Dodi family were portrayed in the worst possible light.
Crap season so far. I mean, the worst.
This is the show that'll keep the monarchy alive
Sorry can’t watch this because I don’t live in the same household as my mother who pays for a family Netflix account because I can barely afford rent so obviously I cannot afford Netflix charge that they keep putting up. Netflix you money hungry weasel.
Song name PLEASE! 😢
I don't believe any of season 6 1st half
And then they killed her 😂
What’s the song that plays at the very beginning of the trailer? Piano, and then strings at 0:43 until 0:55 when the cover of Mad World starts.  Edit: found it - it’s all from the same song. 🙃
She’s scarily like her in some shots.
A REALLY successful season, this last one, like  all the previous ones!! EXCELLENT actors, scénario, EVERYTHING! I really wonder why the formal journalists are so negative! Shame!I find the after death presence of Diana BRILLIANT! It is soothing and very humaine,  like she WAS!! And very in harmony with the whole! We learn about the deep sadness of King Charles, and his very sensitive character . And in fact we learn new  détails about Diana's  affair , that we could not know otherwise! I am sure that the NETFLIX researchers would not lie about certain détails, like the fact that Diana had no intention to remarry! I REALLY ENJOYED this last season very much, and I was of those that cried for sweet Diana when she died , and following her with Love and admiration throughout her life! ❤❤THANK YOU FOR THE EXPERIENCE!❤❤
And yet again they didn't include the most historic scene of Diana's funeral (just a snippet) in the series just like they didn't put the wedding
I love DebIcki but I think this season and last are mostly miscast.
How does one watch this if no Netflix?
Well, now the Queen has died she and Philip take the their graves the facts about her murder.  Probably a hit ordered from the top to MI6.  Tragic.
Marvellous work across the board.
i know damn well i’m gonna cry watching this season.
Its true that the media killed her - both ways, internally and externally. Shame on media
We get to see a sympathetic view of Charles and Dodie's father. And the scenes with diana will very tastefully done bravo to all of you who participated in this production
Bravo bravo bravo, this was very well done. The way they handle Diana's death. The way they handle the Royal family. Excellent excellent excellent
She lose competition | win or die
Whatever you think of this series there is no doubt that Elizabeth Debicki is utterly incredible as Princess Diana, her mannerisms and voice, combined with her body language and looks are just spellbinding and haunting in this role. She deserves awards for her performance.
çok iyi
Are people say that the crown Not real life that I remember what happened Charles and Camilla we’re still seeing each other still in love and poor Diana married him. He just used her, but for the children I still think that the Queen had something to do with Diana’s death, but I don’t think we’ll ever know what really happened to her. She was the only while, but I like rip Diana you are missed
Filimin içerik kısmı iyi bira daha heyecan lı olabilir
These 4 episodes are TRASH!!! I am absolutely disgusted how they found a way to murder her memory
“I just want the girl to have peace” the double meaning
Why have you not portraited princess Diana as a black woman? This is Netflix after all.. Have you started to be against black people now?  Are we witnessing some radical change in Netflix where they try to make partly realistic history?  As a Norwegian i remember clearly how you raped the history of Håkon Jarl as a black woman that ruled in Denmark. People also remember how you tried to fake Cleopatra as a black woman.  So now we want to see Djengis Khan as black. Nelson Mandela as White. Sitting Bull as white and so on.  Why oh why are you making Diana white?  How can we recognise this as a Netflix serial now? I hope you will make up for this by making a documentary about president Trump as a black woman..
Nobody cared that much about Diana when she was alive. Most people in the UK are and always have been largely indifferent to the Royals. They're to us what The Kardashians are to Americans. The whole Diana grieving was just mass hysteria whipped up by the media. It's cringe worthy embarassing to look back at.
Sonuncusu çok güzel görünüyor ve ben kahramanı çok beğendim, izlemeyi sabırsızlıkla bekliyorum
Charles here being a fvcking hypocrite
Its amazing trailer i can't wait
I really wish there was less attention on the Diana story. S1 - 4 were superb because it was multidimensional with all the characters and so much depth. I wanted to know about the queen’s story, Margaret’s, Anne’s, and Philip’s… not just an obsession about Diana’s very well publicized life.
Just finished watching.. OH MY GOD !! Amazing show,amazing crew,thank you so much for this journey so far,filled with emotions and tears 💜💜
The royal family sucks
Çok güzel film
It really pisses me off what the press and media did to Diana....I hope they watch this season and feel ashamed and guilty....
the BEST princess diana i mean this
Mükemmel
❤❤❤❤
FOR A MOMENT DIANA WAS BIGGER THAN ROYALTY. AND IT WAS GLORIOUS.
Princess Diana was the greatest humanitarian hero of my lifetime! I will NEVER concede that her “accident” was an actual accident! I’ve mourned her for 26 years!
Come on again .they are running out of scripts..over and over
she was a peoples Princess
Anyone else catch the Mad World melody at the end?
I'm not ready 😢
Chills!
I hope the writing/dialogue gets better this season. Because last season was not up to the standard of the first couple seasons of The Crown
I honestly don’t know if I can watch the final season. Diana’s death was my first “where were you when…” moment.
Long LIVE OUR DIANA
Sorry we have no interest watching this. Waste money and no true facts.
CHILLS!!! Amazing how much Elizabeth looks like Diana, the mannerisms etc is incredible!
People were extremely unfair on the Queen about Diana. She was worried about her grandkids. Not the selfish public.
FINALLY OMG
GOOSEBUMPS 😭😭😭😭😭
WHAT LOAD OF CRAP....NO THANKS SHOVE IT!
This is unbelievable having seen and lived during this era the costumes everything is right even her voice
Omg when she takes his hand in the car 😭 so sad ! I remember when Diana died in 1997 ! Couldn’t believe it !!
Is it because of the royal family doesn’t like the crown  ?
Last season??? Why are they killing The Crown?????
They killed her
I am not a monarchist by any means, but I am hooked on this series and have been since the start. I will miss it when it has finished.
The trailers for this show are better than the show itself.
I'm already crying and it's just the trailer
My heart is absolutely gonna break
Laughable. Looks nothing like diana. Why even bother with this.
Can wait to watch this!
Queen elizabeth 2 isn't going to witness this season now 😢
Spoiler alert. She dies
goosebumps
This is going to be a sad sad season. 😭 And the final season at that 😢
Then they're going to end it with Diana's death, not the queen's?! Thought it was supposed to be fully about the queen. But I'm going to miss the show so much!
The sad part is they silenced her but her legacy remains strong forever.
When does this come out?
Repeat after me: Elizabeth Debicki does not look like Diana. Debicki is chinless, unfortunately.
Shocked that Netflix hasn’t made Diana black and non binary yet.
Is anybody exhausted with the Diana drama yawn yawn yawn poor Charles having to put up with the nutter
I hope that moment of Diana telling the Queen, "That's not what I wanted," a moment of the Queen talking aloud to herself and that's a phantom of Diana. I feel the show is better than that type of thing.
If there was any justice writer Peter Morgan would receive an OBE for his career of work as an artistic ambassador for Great Britain to the world. Not a chance of that though...
you can't end it there!  Give it a pause, for sure, but you have to do a season on Harry and Megan.
Elizabeth Debicki is so much better as Princess Diana than Emma Corrin was. Corrin gave the most overrated acting performance in any kind of media in 2020. The universal praise Corrin received from critics was ridiculous.
As excited as i am to watch this, i'm also dreading the emotional rollarcoaster.  I hope Elizabeth Debicki gets award for her outstanding performance.
I’d hate to be Camila the 🐪 right now
I’m going to really struggle watching this season, it broke my heart as a child and now to see it play out again will be so heartbreaking! The actor for Diana is incredible! She has her mannerisms and way of speaking to a tee!
Waw relive movie ❤
Gerçekten çok güzel bı film olmuş hikayesi ve anlamı beni benden aldı sanki gerçek gibi
Couldn’t even wait
The İncredible 🎉
Sabırsızlıkla bekliyorum. Efsane bir sezon bizi bekliyor.
I’m not ready for this 😭😭😭😭
Нереально похожа
Are we suppose to feel sorry for a princess who had it all?  I liked Lady Di and her death was a tragedy as she will be remembered for ever.  However the real sadness is for people who lead of life of poverty, sickness, fear and obscurity where the world had absolutely no regard for their life on this planet.  I would say 95% of the people fall into this category.
what song is in the background
I have always seen Diana like my own mother. My mother passed away when I was 7 years old and mental health was elusive to her. Many un-expressed demons in the closet under a mask of beauty, elegance and show-stopping stage presence. May Diana rest.
❤❤❤❤
Im sad I dont want this Drama to end
Ankadım
Frengman cok iyi fiilim de iyi oldugunu dusunuyorum
Woah, Grew up playing Mad World on the piano, also watch and waited for the final season of The Crown.. This trailer is haunting; and I love it.
Truly, what did Diana webt through?!
Your show is full of lies. I stopped watching it at season 3 when you start telling lies and lies.

population crisis and non implementation of Sterilisation program it need to be implemented from peon to member of parliament by hook or crook in all religions in bharat Males who are wasting their precious time from age 21 to 32 years just in preparation of various exams are creating trouble by reproducing and every male must write his surname clearly he belongs to which religion and which caste general category Shudra or Obc This time we all Rajput's and brahmins must unite together call for all Females and males of our community to prevent explosion of population and for resources of india The corruption is at its peak in bharat all the institution is only indulged in corruption from private to govt sectors the gram panchayat to nagar paalika nagar nigam takes 10 to 20% commission in any project and these lawyers with police and administration and politicians are make loot with unemployment at its peak in bharat All bars and benches are under the one community The Rajputs, Jaats Brahmins and kayastha only real rajputs not those backwards lodhs etc Politicians apart from party making mockery of people they hand in glove with each other across parties and in this bureaucracy, executive and bars and bench are involved  educated unemployment is on its high This is very ugly face of politics in bharat the politicians and their family members are only getting rich and wealthy while common educated people are continuously suffering in bharat I will repeatedly raise the issues what all political persons are doing from gram panchayat to parliament of India only nepotism in every field whether legislature executive or judiciary and so called fourth pillar the media and mediahouses running by businesshouses the politicians with bureaucracy executive and judiciary in high courts and supreme courts are blocked by few people from past 75 years and India is suffering of educated unemployment at its peak we are moving towards stagflation with politicians and businessmen who are politicians and their relatives are continuously getting benefitted  explosion of population must be dealt with heavy hand This time world community have to come forward to deal with excessive population of world and the govt in india is repeating again with bjp rest unemployment will remain bcoz politicians are equally corrupt like people made them across all the political parties common people is just a tool nothing more  The universities &schools must reduce excessive pressure on children and youths by making 50 -50% mcq and theory based examination in all domains from class 11 to ph.d.   this is to be applied at earliest we are witnessing suicides in India at peak Every citizen or NRI of Bharat seeing the comment have to accept that from past 75 years now india witnessing population explosion& everywhere the religious fanatism to make mini Pakistan in pockets is at its peak youth specially males from age bracket of 21 to32 years in Hindus just wasting lives in preparation of various competitive exams but we don't have seats so do some productive work and Medical ,Law field success after course only to those who have father or mother from politics of being Pradhan to mp mla mlcs in Bharat or big renowned lawyers in high courts of various states judges in high and supreme courts or like us bureaucrats journalists for medical field doctors or medical institute owners only they can sustain this generation youths need to understand that they do not reproduce becoz we don't have resources to sustain such a large population only 40crores people can be supported If u a male & earning less than 1 lakhs per month don't reproduce or get married Bharat is overpopulated & suicide whether getting failed in exams or competition is being a common phenomenon no change in govt can deal with that so support only bjp  but corruption is widespread and become integral part in Bharat by politicians and Bureaucracy is equally responsible Those  males who are brilliant not duffers  got prestigious jobs in ssc to upsc maximum to max 25 or 26 years males got upsc & various other states civil services witnessing so many of them while duffers are only not got selected Being a first attempt qualifier of The most toughest exams of india I have witnessed the corruption in almost every secretariat of state government and union too the parties may be any but almost all the Politicians hand in glove with most of corrupt bureaucrats,ips ifs and other services in our upsc even the clerks in district offices secretariat are continuously looting the country on other hand I am seeing the unemployment among educated youths of nation the money trail works in almost every remaining government sector jobs u pay sufficient amount which varies from 10 lakhs to 2 crores and can get any job u want but filters are placed of caste vacancies are sold at large scale in all whether bjp or Congress govt which is a sordid face india is facing Along with that the complete bureaucracy with bar and benches are dominated only by two The Rajputs or Brahmins  and this is reality.Not only that the vice chancellors dean of different departments in technical & other universities are dominated by The Rajputs or Brahmins and this is by help of Bjp and Congress . Because these backwards castes are just a vote giving machines whose voice will he crushed by us I have seen the VC of BHU, DU ,and lucknow university is the most biased ones need an immediate prosecution Against them but the government run by Yogi the king of Rajputs and keshav maurya the corrupt person they are politicising every thing and judiciary is silent like a corpse. The medical colleges and hospital doctors to the chief engineers scientists all are from our community that The Rajputs and Brahmins so we need to throw them out these muslims backwards castes out of bharat to make Hindu Rashtra🚩
So beautiful, so elegant just looking like a wow!
OMGGGG
Idk if I can watch this like I know Diana dies but I am hopping she doesn’t 😭😭😭😭😭 (but I know I’m going to binge watch it in one seating)
Harika  Çok güzeldi devamını bekliyorum ❤
It's so sad being at the final season..😢
Cidden çok heyecanlı 🎉🎉🎉
THIS IS GOING TO BE SO GOOD MY GOD
Talk about hitting a grand slam with the casting in this show
Have watched this trailer about 10 times!!!! Simply CAN.NOT.WAIT to see this. Incredible show with unbelievable casting and acting. TV history/herstory.  👑  📺 gold
The black sheep what I felt all my life. Thats why I adore Diana. She loved ppl even those who didnt love her, betrayed her, and humiliated her. She handled it with grace
Boycott Netflix
I wish they continue the show, this can’t be the final season😭
This is all very well and good, but imagine being any relative of Diana and having your family once again being shown as a drama series. Poor William and Harry, as well as Diana's family.
The point is regardless of the divorce and King Charles III on the throne, Diana’s son, Prince William will inevitably be King of the UK and the Commonwealth. This is why being sure of one’s spouse as direct in line to the throne is important and why Kate will be a true Queen. The British Royal Family can’t have consecutive generations of Kings with divorcees where their former spouse’s children inevitably become British monarchs. King Charles compromised his throne with Camilla and including Jerusalem oil and the Roman Catholic Church in the coronation. This is why Diana is resurrected through celebrations of the outfits she wore at appearances. Through resurrecting Diana in protest and Sir Kier Starmer criticizing the Prime Minister and Prince Harry for likely not becoming King: marrying an american actress female divorcee; moving away with Meghan and starting a family in California; fighting British Press, what the Magna Carta defended Free Speech and profiting from confessing British Royal Family Secrets, the US can have a say 🇬🇧
Who knew the peace she found would be Rest In Peace
I've never watched this show, but I will now after seeing Elizabeth Debicki as Princess Diana. I have recently become more obsessed with her acting, especially in Vita and Virginia.
*This should get more views!!!*
lol im surprised they didnt make her black
omg what is the song its amazing
Bu aslında Diana'nın konuşmasına benziyordu. Üşüme. Debicki, Emmy senin.
Bu aslında Diana'nın konuşmasına benziyordu. Üşüme. Debicki, Emmy senin.
Filmi hala izlemedim ama harika görünüyor
bruh i do not like netflix much anymore bc it removed the movie home 😡🥺😭😭😢
This is very good
I still feel sadness for Diana, constantly having the paparazzi and then ended up dying while trying to run away from them….
This will be such a hard season to watch but bittersweet to say goodbye to. It has such an amazing cast over the years and beautifully written. I hope it receives much award recognition this upcoming year. May Diana continue to rest peacefully as she never could in this life and live on in our hearts.
Her journey is wrapping up
Much support for Free Palestine 🇸🇩
I saw the Ritz and then went through the tunnel where Diana's car crashed a year after it happened. I was shocked how short the distance was between the 2 points.
I hope there's more to this season that Diana. The family continued after her, and everything she did is online.
I wish they extended to season 7 until the end
OH! Don't get into that car Diana! 😟
I just want to see Kate's story now. Diana have her own so many movies.
Elizabeth is definitely one of the most beautiful women on the planet
No way its the final season 😮
Omg this looks so good, rip diana queen of hearts❤
the press is not to blame really, she did everything she could in order to attract all the attention....she never lived a quiet life.!
it is only the trailer but im alreay sobbing
İzlemeye değer bir film
Final season?  I thought they were going to do the story up to the Queen’s death?  Surely that would require at least two more seasons?
I personally hope they show a scene depicting the car accident
Can’t believe this will be the final season. I really enjoyed the series
GIVE DEBICKI EMMY 2024 BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS IN A DRAMA SERIES. I HAVE A FEELING THAT THIS IS THE CROWN SWEEP IN 2024
Should’ve had Kristen Stewart play as Diana. This show looks like shit.
Didn't we already see this in the Helen Mirren movie 🫤
I wish they could have recreated Balmoral properly
Meghan Markle can't wait for season 11 where they finally get to her chapter
Princes Diana’s death is something i will never accept , I miss you Princess..
This will be so better than season 5.
Woah woah woah. I was Harry's age, but still remember it so well. It's almost too much to watch this trailer.
GOOSEBUMPS
Literal CHILLSSSSSSSS I love it here
I don’t watch this show but will be watching this season
👍🏻
دي ديانا
As someone previously stated... "Debicki, the Emmy is yours".
Elizabeth Debicki *is* Diana 💔
I watch as Elizabeth Debicki, in the role of Diana, sits sadly on the edge of a yacht in a blue swimsuit, and I get goosebumps.
WOW
Does she die?
RIP princess Diana
TODOS ESTABAMOS ESPERANDO ESTA TEMPORADA AUN ANTES DE QUE LA SERIE EMPEZARA..
Wooooww❤❤❤❤
The Royal Family ordered the hit on Diana
This is making me emotional. Still miss Diana
coz of paps she was killed!! 😢😢She’s still missed😢
The TIME has come
Ghouls
Her eyes are beautiful
i dont think Diana was this depressed all the time.
This is definitely going to be an emotional season ❤
Naomi watts ?
What’s the name of the trailer song ?
Some shots makes her actually look like Diana.
Its very ibvious that the quenn havw killed her!! The queen is the most disgusting person i ever saw in my life! Couldnt be happier when she die
Sadly Mohammed Alfayed won’t be able to watch the new season 😢
god, I want to backhand Charles so hard.
Chillsss
Clever how they sneaked in the beginning of Mad World at 1:56
Someday you'll leave this world behind, be ready. God so loved the world that He gave His only Son (Jesus Christ) that whoever believes in Him will not die but have everlasting life. John 3:16 Receive Christ and believe today the consequences are eternal!
ESpero que essa temporada seja melhor que a 5ª, que foi péssima.
Which song did they used on this trailer?
Can’t wait 😊
I wish they weren't stopping after this season. Wonder why.
This is ghoulish
Fine, I'll pay for another month or two of Netflix. Sheesh. LOL
Looks waaaay better than that monstrosity version using *Kristen Stewart*
I would absolutely love a Actors Round Table but have it be all of the cast of The Crown
I'm sorry, but this just feels wrong to watch... I loved the first seasons of the Crown, but I've stopped watching it just before they introduced Diana into the story. I was curious where in the timeline they would end the show, hoping it would be before Diana's death. Seeing this just reminds me why I stopped. We should never forget that this is not fiction. There are two men out there for whom this is a retelling of probably the most traumatic event in their lifetime. Harry was 12 when it happened and I too lost my mom at that age. I can't even imagine what it would feel like for actors to recreate my mom's death on a TV show. I mean there is a young actor portraying the grieve that he felt and probably still feels. How can we justify that? Not to mention that Diana's death was caused by the public's obsession with her and now people are exploiting that death even more? Diana's death should be a cautionary tale of the devastating power the media holds, but instead it has become a cash grab for Netflix.
Ate left no crumbs
The reason why I watch The Crown is because of Diana...
Imagine if she just had said no to the Paris invitation 😢
Even though Dianas death has already been handled in other productions, i have the feeling that this take's going to be an emotional blow for everyone!
2 weeks!!! Can't wait
They have done such a Wonderful job with this show. Can't wait.
No​, pleasee😢
I’m going to hate this season because I love Diana so much ☹️
I am glad this will be the final season. If they were to make anything after Elizabeth death it would be a sht show.
Netflix Make The “N” And For Suggesting Send Me One Promo ♥️💋
damn....... at the first, i thought it's really her. what a perfomance!!!!!!!
I do hope that the Diana chapter isn't the end of the Crown.. i do hope they wrap it up with ERII as they started.. we shall see...
She died because of bad husband...
Harika bir flim
Nice. Brings back a lot of memories. Diana ❤
is that u mrs. umbridge
What utter bollocks.
eagerly waiting ❤
I don’t know why people say they see ‘Umbridge’. When I look at Imelda, I see THE QUEEN
why did she have to die? I still remember that day, it was just so sad and devastating!
The final series has included some terrific scenes between the late Queen and Princess Margaret played by the unbeatable Lesley Manville.
Charles killed Lady Diana there's no doubt about it
I'd like to believe that Diana really can be found on a boat somewhere at sea looking back on everything that happened proud with what her life means to so much of us
For gods sakes Netflix, stop portraing Princess Diana as a certified moron. Why dont you make a documentary, about Princess Diana’s assassination? You know she was assassinated. You are aware of the 6000 documents - the socalled Diana file - the France bizarely claimed had been misplaced, just two weeks ahead of the socalled Inquest in London in 2007, where the Inquest Judge - Lord Scott Stevens - withheld over 700 documents from his own jury - the Diana file is locked away in a vault , at the Palais de Justice, later apparently moved to Paris Court of Appeal, guarded by armed guards. So the question you have to ask is, why? Why are 6000 documents pertaining to Princess Dianas death in Paris, locked away in vault in hidden from the public? No one can get access  to the files. Ever. If there is nothing to coverup, then why is there a cover-up? If the documents are innocous , then why cant they be released to the public? Because this was an assassination , a conjoint operation, between french intelligence, British intelligence and American intelligence. When the Americans are involved, then so are Mossad. Personally I believe Mossad, executed Princess Diana in a conjoint operation with western intelligence. Only Mossad could carry out an operation of this magnitude with the consent of the UK Queen. Why are people so surprised,  thar she was assassinated? The BBC is run by the MI5. The BBC put on ‘Death in a Tunnel’ - on the 30th of august 1997, at 22:00. Because they knew, Diana was going to be sssassinated that night. The price she paid for the Panorama interview in 1995, was getting assassinated in 1997.
this looks boring, they should focus more on the queen, the show is called the crown
Elizabeth Debicki's performance made me weep. I can't believe Diana's death still hurts after all this time. I can't imagine what it must be like for those who truly knew her and loved her. She was a beautiful, luminous soul.
The flowers 😢
I cannot waitttt  this series is just amazing !!
Chills
Di dated Alot
Brought a tear to my eyes... Never forget Diana and the end of a remarkable series
It is soooooooo scary and cool how she sounds EXACTLY and looks EXACTLY like her!
This trailer gave me chills.
I recently went back and re-watched season 5 after convincing myself for and others over the past year that I 'couldn't get into it'.  I eat my words now, it's actually pretty excellent. I think I was missing Olivia Colman (Queen Elizabeth) and Gillian Anderson's (Margaret Thatcher) brilliant performances along with Josh O'Connor as Charles.  So now I'm looking forward to the final chapter in this incredible show.
She’s the best Diana IMO
Why not another season? It's not like the queen's final years lack material for content between the saga of prince Andrew, Harry and Megan's exit, brexit, covid 19, prince Philip's death, etc.
i think, if it's her, she could go back to the past and change the course of things....
Looks like her, sounds like her. Can't wait... X feels like yesterday we lost her. 😢💔
brividi
1:19 that bit hit really bad, can't hold my tears. It's the news RIP Lady Diana
Harika bir filim kesinlikle izlemelisiniz!!!
This is going to be tough to watch, was such a hard moment remember being so bothered by it as a child.
What do you mean by final season, we still have all of Harry and Meghan to get through
Looking forward to this last season. Maybe not as much as the astroturfing bots here, but I'm still excited.
Tek kelimeyle mükemmel
FINAL SEASON?????? NOOO. The drama continues. Meghan and Harry are still left. CREATORRSSS, THIS IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE THE FINAL SEASON !!!!
This series casting has always been AWESOME
😢😢😢
Diana was so ill, I’m sad for her, at that time no one care fot mental illness  Her family or the RF were clueless
Just looking at this actor's face, felt like giving her a tight slap and asking to stop behaving like this entitled. So irritating. Just by looking at her face one can understand how scheming she is .
Superb ❤. Poor Diana.
300 Aginst a !0,000,000.
tey casr diana so well...charles not so much.....but this season im not ready for😭😭😭😭 theres so much of the story to tell
It should be called Lady Di now
Are we literally getting an elizabeth haunted by Diana story in her death? Or do you think it's pre
I’m actually very tired of the Diana/Charles story being the SOLE FOCUS of the last 3 seasons.
WOAH, SEASON 6!? I planned of watching this in 2019 and I was at least hoping to finish the show before the final season comes. Guess what? I'm still at season 1 😭 Procrastination really is incredible, lol.
High key the best diana 'movie' made
no one in america should think about the british royal family on a daily basis
I am really tired of season 5 and 6 focusing on Diana so much. Thats why my fav were first 4 seasons. Diana and her love story and heartbreaks are ok but get boring after a point. We need the story of Britain!
watched this show the day it came out during my last year of middle school… now I’m in college and it’s about to finish 😢
Not a Royalist but did watch the 1st season on a whim  cant wait for this now cos i binged the whole thing TWICE
Will they show the queen death in the final season? I mean she is now death so i wonder if with the IRL queen death the actor who play the queen Elizabeth will made the last breathing of queen Elizabeth II a perfect end for the series the Crown.
Poor Diana 😢
I am not ready for this at all.
I’m surprised that actually a white woman is playing her. It’s a miracle considering the woke agenda nowadays 😅
this is going to be absolutely heart wrenching
Can't wait
The crown season 5 was an insulting portrayal of Diana. I hope we see the script for season 6 bring justice back for the foundation Emma corrin laid out
From Elizabeth Debicki and the entire cast of this production, well done!!! this is incredible and I can't wait to see it!
Why is this the final season, I thought they were casting William and Kate?
Hope it's not the snooze fest the last season was.
The perfection of the trailer focusing on Princess Diana made me think that she was for a while the crown ❤
1:51 this is going to be the biggest load of shite that anybody has ever seen.

I'm so sick of the attacks on this show. If you don't want to watch it, don't. I think they've handled the twisted story of this weird family extremely well. The show is thoughtful, lush and compassionate. The Diana storylines are amazing and heartbreaking. It's a great series! I will be watching.
I just gasped when they included that infamous photo of her in that boat. I really want to know the story behind that moment. With that being said, I am not prepared for the emotional wreck this final season might offer especially when they cover about her accident.
why the final season? wtf
This sent chills down my spine.
This trailer makes it look like season 6 will be better than season 5
Quando q sai mais episódio de Demom slayer ? 0:25
Let's be honest. The 90s is the season we have all been waiting for...
Complete rubbish, the lot of it.  Portraying real people falsely, simple as that.  How would you like it?
And all she wanted was to be loved. Her poor boys.
Looking forward to this season. Really hope its better than season 5. Please have a better charles the last season he was too good looking imo. The other seasons they had the character on point.
Oof.. gonna be a tough one 🥲
I'm glad they're splitting the season, this way the hype will go on longer
Elizabeth is nailing it, the voice is the hardest part and we can hear Diana in her performance. Such a hard role to do. Every award needs to come her way.
Kuwa.....
Song?
Teared up watching this trailer.
Disappointed with this trailer it’s too focused on Diana
She was awesome in Tenet! Also with too many boats 😝
This must be really difficult for Dianas family right now. It all being re-evaluated by another new public eye all over again. The narrative being owned once more by others.
Still miss Diana  😞
Donnie Darko Music?
They did Diana so dirty last season & painted Charles so nicely I'm wondering if it's gonna be the same this season.
I wish and hope this last season we see more of Queen Elizabeth reactions to all that madness. Diana's story is a very important one and the way the actress portraits her is amazingly good. Having said that, let us not forget the series started giving us The Crown from The Queen's perspective, a fascinating character by her own merit. Hope we see more into The Queen's head during these hard times. I wish it would not end at that point in history. The Queen Elizabeth had an extremely hard job, that she endured until her final days.
oscar material
The ending must be sad😢
It's as if Paris Hilton played Lady Di (but with the ACTUAL voice of Lady Di). 😄
Çok güzel olmuş
I'll be sad to see this show end. It's eye opening to see the responsibility and burden the crown brings to it's wearer, especially in the modern world. I hope they reboot the season and explore the life of other monarchs such as Queen Victoria.
my take. It was King Charles who got married to an 18 year old knowing fully well rhat he was already in a relationship... Any body will feel betrayed and wronged if they r cheated upon.
Can’t wait to see this incredible series!
If they dont give Imelda Staunton better lines and scenes she will have the ignominious distinction of NOT winning an Emmy compared to the previous two who played Elizabeth II in The Crown! Step it up Peter Morgan! Dont let her just be reactive and sulking all through this final season! You failed the queen last season 😜
Got instant goosebumps when I was reading the "Paris next week?" note...
I am 18 years old from Russia 🇷🇺  and i adore queen Elizabeth 2 and the whole  Royal family my heart was broken when i found out about her death even despite her advanced age😪. I m also  so sorry that the monarhy  was abolished in 1917 in my country .God save the new king of Great Britain!  🇬🇧.
Gooseeeebumpsss🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Can't wait to tune in!   I love the show!
We live in a twilight world
Diana was such A MESS
Life of Lady Diana is a perfect example of why it is so important to marry right
Thankfully this is coming to an end
I donno y they r ending it here.... maybe some issues but they should make it till the queens death. It started with her reign and should end there too
Oh she got her voice and body movements perfectly
im more shocked at you didnt decide to make her black in this one @netflix
Brilliant
The world still feels livable because of the existence of incredible shows like these.
Watching this trailer brought Goosebumps and tears of sadness.
Elizabeth is Diana. It’s insane! Her mannerisms, everything. She deserves all the awards for this 😊
I imagine it's somewhat easy for an Australian to pull off a South-East English accent, but Debicki even manages to pull off a received pronunciation accent, whilst looking exactly like Diana. She really was made for this role. Perfect casting.
for those who dont like the netflix abo changes, new developer teams and other startups work on new streaming services with the old netflix conditions. So we won't need netflix anymore soon.
Royal family can suck it, their all awful people including the queen's son is who now king
I swear when the note said Paris 😢
im so excited but i’m gonna SOB when i watch this
Car Driver: Long live the queen  DIANA WAS KILLED!!!
I  really wish Helen Mirren wouldn’t have turned down portraying the Queen  As much as I love Emelda , she wasn’t the right choice.
I never thought they gonna give us  everythink in part 1. I am not ready to see her dying...
They killed her (((
Paris is always a good idea... sometimes it's not !
She is a Legend now
Diana. Forever in our hearts ❤❤❤❤❤😢
Got goosebumps at the scene where all phones rang 😢
whelp the trailer got me in tears already
The song fits perfectly
My first impression is when did Dolores Umbridge turned into Queen Elizabeth?
Dominic West is way too hot to play Charles.
This is THE season.
Hollywood just can’t let this woman be dead.
Can't wait!
Does anyone know what song is that at the very last few seconds where she is sitting above the sea?
Someone knows the music’s name of the soundtrack?
Elizabeth deserves everything.
Elizabeth is insanely perfect. She deserves all the awards, how the H. She didn't get all them already, but Gillian A. did with that pain throat  talking.
What is that soundtrack from 1:56-2:00? I cannot grasp it, but it reminds me of something.
Elizabeth Debicki is phenomenal as Princess Diana. Can't wait for season 6.
Such a heartbreaking story that I am not even sure I would like to watch it
They left out the part where the family ordered the hit, pumped the strobe in the tunnel causing the accident, and then where Diana survived the crash, was awake and speaking after, and then mysteriously died in the ambulance on the way to the hospital. But we can go with this too…
Looks good. Can't wait!
The photo of Diana, at the end of that diving board, all alone,  symbolizes in such an exquisite way where she was at the end of her life. Isolated, trapped by her fame, her beloved sons becoming that much closer to adulthood and autonomy. She died at a crossroad in her life.  I'm skirting hyperbole when I say it's damn near Shakespearean.
I agree Elizabeth decki and Kristen Stewart who play Diana in the movie Spencer’s  really shoe how a human can feel when doesn’t fit in the norms of the society . I don’t know we’ll Elizabeth so I can’t tell but kristen Stewart in her real life is also against certains norms and she talk publicly about her own anxiety . I’m sure Elizabeth has something in her life that maker her understand the role.   Not an easy one.! Gréât job to both.
It’s quite uncanny how Elizabeth encapsulates Diana. I’m excited for this season because I’m interested in seeing how they portray queen.
Still makes me cry. I remember the live breaking news from Paris that night. A true princess of the people. Forever missed! (I don't forgive what her ex and mistress did to her)
❤güzel bir film
The final season should have been the death of her majesty the queen. The series started about her and should end about her. anyways, can't wait!
Are we getting Michael Sheen as MP again ? Pls say yes ❤❤
Oh dear... Final months of Diana's life - truly chilling. And the consequences it had for the monarchy - its a longer version of The Queen (one of The Crown's origins). Can't wait for it!!!
Elizabeth looks cross between Diana and uk tv presenter Jill Dando with that blonde pixie cut ❤️❤️
Please the final season should be about The Crown not Diana
I’m not ready for this season
Why didn’t they show charles slowly killing diana in the crash?
Cant wait
I will cry a river watching this and I am okay with it
She’s incredible omg
oh this season is gonna be so sad
Princess Diana was magnificent human being and always will be. The mistress became the queen is a laughble symbol and a black stain on British Empire which had lost it credibility around the world a king who cheated on his wife in the so call love for his missters and ruined  princess Daina life.   As a women i dont have any sympathy for The Royal family.  Charles and camila should never be the king and queen as they don't deserve to be one because they destroyed another human beings life. it should have gone to William and his Kate 🙌
Çok güzel
Why are we pretending Charles didn’t plan the “accident”?
spoiler alert guys i think she dies :(
Can’t wait
My only negative opinion was the casting of prince Charles  and prince Philip
*They didn't leave much time for Diana's relationship with Dodi Fayed*
Isn't this series about queen Elizabeth? Then why the series is ending with death of princess Diana?
and now Im crying again. gosh.. such a tragic for beautiful soul. Rest in love Princess Diana
Ich weis noch nicht,ob ich mir dieser Film ansehe. 😢 Dieser Tag,als Lady Diana von uns ging,werde ich nie vergessen. Es fühlt sich so an,als es Gestern war,den es passierte 1 Tag nach der Geburt,von meiner Tochter 😭
The casting of this show is just perfection
I’m so exited!
What Netflix has done to this family is truly disgusting and all for the almighty Dollars, what Netflix put on its streaming channel is old retired series and movies giving you perhaps one decent movie each year, would not pay for this when I can download for free.
All these years later, RIP Princess Diana. We will never forget you.
The last shot gave me chills. It was the last photo taken of her living.
Diana: Will you all miss me?  Us: We never forgot you since August 31st.
I preferred the earlier seasons.
Despicable! Netflix should be ashamed.
Why Netflix, do you have to release it in parts?! Ugh, you heartless patootie!
Poor Princess Diana never found peace in this family.  She was a beautiful soul. Rest in peace.  Such grace and beauty she had. Nobody will ever fill her shoes!!❤
I need that trailer music!!!
Ughhhh the casting... chefs kissss
It's just so sad
The Royals: they want the attention, and then dont want the attention. You cant have it both ways. You contribute nothing of value to the world...yet want attention
It looks like a Johnny Depp mad hook walk the plank Trailer. I could be wrong… yet not any of her end of life story, is appropriate on any level.
this feels soooooo sad 😢
Según la serie a Diana lo usó la corona para tener hijos luego lo arrojaron a su suerte
I cannot wait to see this
never watched this show ... until now, will be watching coz damn bravo to that actress playing dianna . will be skipping the paris episode tho
More Cult of St Diana the Wronged and Perfect. Sigh.
The saddest scene is yet to come. We all know what happened but it’s still going to be painful.😢
They haven't experienced Megan Markle yet....😮
The Crown made a mockery of both Winston Churchill & Margret Thatcher. They made them both look like blundering idiots. I stopped watching because of Netflix’s sheer disrespect for anyone conservative. Netflix can kiss my ASS!
Diana was not always the innocent victim she liked to portray herself
Wow, the Princess Di actress is a dead ringer. I got chills watching this. I still do not like Charles and his hanger on.
Diana was an awesome soul, but Please inform me we the royal family is so adored and centralized exactly otherwise?.
I came here to see Meredith shouting: You're the people's princess! Diana was nothing!
That symbolism at the very end. Diana on the brink. Of the Crown. Literally. Love it.
CHIIIILLLLLLLLLSSSSSSSSSSS
This has been an unbelievable drama. I'll be sorry when it ends.
I'm still banning Netflix from producing this totally disrespectful fiction. I watched the first few years, but then dropped it. Too many people think it's all fact, when it's only a fiction based on loose truths, that the Queen herself hated.
"Paris next week?" 😢
01:50  "zenebonabizabinasthingdaworld azevaseen"
Were done celebrating this British monarchy that destoyed half of the globe with its power hungry schemes. What's happening today is a direct results of all of these idiots.
That shot on the yacht. I'll never forget seeing it on the front page of a paper, and hearing she has died.
name of the song?
Wow Elizabeth Debickis performance is haunting...she looks just like her and sometimes feels like I'm watching Diana..
All the Emmys. Now.
the world now is on the verge of a great war, and guess what we have? the life of a woman who did not have anything to do in her life but hanging around. our world is crazy.
This final season is going to be so epic. It's said that this show is ending though 😢
As amazing as this looks I felt so uncomfortable watching it…it  just seems so disrespectful to her and her family. Please let this woman rest in peace and stop trying to make money off of her even in death.
She is way too tall for the part.Difficult to watch her performance. Sorry. Emma was right for the part😢😮
You are getting good at this
I have waited enough.....
1:51   wait WHAT?!?   I don't speak British.
2 parts?why?😮
Hope that blonde woman survives. I’m rooting for her.
Diana  was the real  Queen !!!! People were going to burn that place to the ground if they didn't come out with a statement about her passing...👑👑👑
Netflix monthly price is 6 dollar available If anyone interested
Crazy that they are actually though with the scene were the Queen shoots Diana on the face with a shotgun.
1:51 Prince Charles brings the Busta Rhymes vibes.
Çok güzel bir film
The final shot in the trailer looks like a scene from "Tenet" 😊
Elizabeth Debicki was stunning! Awesome 😮
The Final Season? WHAT???
She was the world's biggest gold digger.
Goosebumps
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
All the phones and lights going on at once was so eerie.
I hate that they keep doing these Part 1 and 2 series, which is annoying af!!
I can’t wait to cancel my Netflix account after watching the last season.
It’s too much😢 I remember exactly where I was and what I was doing on that fateful day. It was like the world stood still
Basically this season is the remake of Helen Mirren's The Queen
Wow that was an emotional trailer, good job Netflix 👍🏽👏🏽
2:04 Literally Diana
They killed her.
They killed her , I don't care WHAT they say
This is one of the few shows that can pick the right actors and actresses. This casting is just perfect.
Harika 🎉😂
The legend that's bigger than the lot.
I'm already crying 😢
eu não tô preparada para esse final
Season 6?? When did that happen?? I thought this show was like 1 or 2 seasons💀
We will see why William and Harry are hard on the press and why they were so disappointed in the family. They were old enough now to understand.  It's just a trailer and already I feel anger to all those stalkers who took advantage of their professions. And they really were stalkers.
It's a miracle that the great Elizabeth survived Diana.  And it’s sad that she didn’t survive the shame of Charles and Harry.
TRASH
my heart is breaking, remembering diana is the saddest part
i'm so excited
Long Live Gaza 🇵🇸 ❤️🩸Long Live Palestine 🇵🇸 ❤️🩸
Elizabeth Debicki is such a stunner.
Part I Should be called: The Royal Diaries of “Queen” Diana  Part II on the other hand should be called- In Memoriam of Her Majesty and the United Kingdom
Reaally nice i like
1:43 Diana gave people what they needed. Me: And she died for it.  *tears up* the madness of crowds.
So the crown series six is just a dramatisation about Diana. How about 9/11 or the election of Tony Blair, the war in Iraq The millennium?.
white? really?
WOW!!! So excited! But why the FINAL season??? Why not keep going??? There’s so much more…………
Oh wow 🥺 I’ve loved every season of this show and I think this one is going to be the best. I was wondering how they were going to handle Diana’s death and it looks like they stayed true to the timeline
I thought that “I’m lesbian because it’s hip to be a lesbian these days” girl from Twilight played Diana in this series?
Why carnt they make hr look normal without that silly look and pout in case they haven’t realised she didn’t pout and look up in that way all the bloody time 🤬🤬💩
From" long may she reign" to "long was her reign"😢😢
I've never understood why people idolise celebrities and well known figures. All these years after Diana's death and people still can't have a rational, logical conversation about her. Some parts because they believed what has been said but mostly they've projected their difficulties onto Diana.   It scares me that people can't see how unhealthy they are and millions of people's ability to see the reality of the world and nature is disturbing. I fear for people not being able to step back from their emotions for a moment
Wishing everyone an amazing day ahead ❤️❤️
Cannot wait to see it 😭😭
“All one wants is for that girl to find peace”  But they’re the institution that had her killed…
Spoilers: She dies
Diana is literally taylor swift if you think about it
😭😭😭😭
Elizabeth was made for this role. I couldn't imagine any other actress to play Diana. She's perfect.
I can't wait ... The casting looks amazing 👏👏👏👏👏
Crash episode has Michael Bay as guest director!
That actually sounded like Diana speaking. The chills. Debicki, the Emmy is yours.
chills.
I want to crown to tell us the future 😂
Spoilers, Lady Di ends up with a hubcap wedged in her thigh.
I wonder if they'll have a scene of Elizabeth learning about Diana's death and immediately asking if she had any of the crown jewels on her. Still think her death was planned
This rekindles my hate for the British monarchy. They should not exist in an ideal world. Power just because of a genetic lottery.
So we will see how the press (and the ever hungry public) hounded her final years. And to top it off we will further sensationalise her death. Will she ever be allowed peace? Will her children? This is just Netflix profiting from her death.
This is going to be one of the best seasons of television ever, I already know it.
it its terrifying how that actress really looks like Diana! WOW I am speechless..!
Music is Mad World by 2WEI
Dude this just feels weird since the Queen died.
Was the queen this villainous in real life? “You finally succeeded in turning this house upside down” is so insensitive
Is this season also pure fiction?
I was only seven months old when Diana died but I want Emma and Elizabeth to appear in flashbacks as Diana
The casting of this show is impeccable
When I saw her in The man from U.N.C.L.E, i immediately thought she'd be in a Diana biopic. And there she is.
Man, I'd be crying watching that
the Sovereign !
Nobody let her live peacefully when she was alive, there is no point in making noise after her death.. She won't get what she lost
Also, when Netflix says “season finale”, does that mean they won’t show us the beginning of William and Kate’s relationship? I was rlly hoping to see that:/
A literal ghost to the late Queen and her cheating son! Diana is the Queen of our hearts!
I love Imelda Staunton as an actress. But she is SO WRONG for this role.  Her interpretation of QEII is so cold. Like Ice. I cannot watch it.
I swear I’m gonna cry all night
SEX
All I can see is the note “Paris next week?” Yess yess yes
Guys, judging by this trailer, I think somebody’s going to die! Can’t tell who though. Excited to see what the writers will choose!!
OMG! I absolutely can’t wait 👍
My name is kate, and i sometimes take prince andrews breath a way, with my fits
Finally!😊
Wow elizabeth definitely bring Lady Diana back to life..
There are 6 seasons of this?!
Very impressive, Elizabeth Debecki is very pretty as Diana! 28.10.2023
I’m not ready
This is chilling
They’re crazy for ending it before the Meghan Markle era - maybe they’ll end it with the Queens passing. I could respect that
I don't know if i can do it. I lived through this time and it tore me apart
The only season I will watch for Princess Diana. Besides the other season - this is what I have been waiting for.
im so mad this is the last season, now that the queen has passed it would be great if the crown also ended with her funeral
So good. I’m in
This is the best Diana portrayal so far in all of the movies/series based on her.....absolutely spot on!
Let go finally I'm ready
It doesn't make sense to end the series just like that! This is THE CROWN! It started with Elizabeth ascending to the British throne so it would make more sense to end it with her death. Why can't they add a 7th season to fast forward to the end of Elizabeth's reign? They could just brush up on the Harry and Meghan fiasco without putting their characters on the screen, if they want to be considerate, and focus on Elizabeth and other world affairs...oh well
Last trailer was better with bitter sweet symphony
The Crown: Season 6 will have my Princess Diana wig flying in all different directions. Overall, good trailer.
The music sounds hauntingly like the song from Donnie Darko. Where everyone knows the fate of the main character.
The producers and editors obviously know what a gut punch Diana's death was to many of us. I send love to her family, the ones who felt her transition with the highest acuity.
How the most privileged became the most depressed person.
Wow I can wait to Watch It! 📺
I believe the soundtrack is a cover of Mad World, from Tears for Fears. Gave me chills
I was four coming up to five when Diana passed away. Now Im 31 and this season will make me cry as Charles did say, "And they adored her for it." He was right. Diana made us adore her and this season will break us and relive that fateful day we heard the news
Claire Foy. Monumental.
Ah I was 15 when she passed. I'll never forget the day she died. I was babysitting my baby brother who was only 2 months old then. I'm the same age as William so I felt for him having to Bury his mum. She was only 36. My mum was 34. It was a strange time. All over every channel. All the UK tabloids covered in black and with her on the front in black and white. The funeral was very sad but the UK just shut down. I'm in Ireland but we watched England just fall into grief for right up till Xmas that year. Feels just like yesterday not 26 years ago. Now I know how they feel to lose a parent. I lost my dad 2 months ago at 41. To be 15 and lose your mum. That's hard. 😞
I hope they display the truth that she was murdered and it was no accident. The man with the white car that instigated the accident and got away just in time and somehow found burned to death in his car after 2 shots in the head later!!!! And how the surveillance Cameras conveniently werent working..  it is OBVIOUSLY a murder.
For those who complain about the fact that the last few seasons focus too much on Diana... it is not possible to talk about the last decades of the crown, without talking extensively about Diana! She made the British royal family popular around the world after the first decades of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II, who couldn't boast the same media attention she got thanks to hurricane Diana! Even today the English royals are followed and popular because the heir to the throne is Diana's son! Prince Harry is known and attracts media attention because he is Diana's son! When Diana's children speak about her publicly, the world stops, because from their words arise the real memories of those poor children who lost their mother so early and who moved the world by walking behind the hearse in those funerals followed by all television broadcasters. Charles III is negatively famous throughout the world for having married Diana, and his historic affair with Camilla. Diana changed everything and her legacy is still seen today. Diana's legacy still brings attention and interest to the royals. Almost 30 years after her death, films, TV series and documentaries are being made about her. For each of William's children, similarities to Diana are looked for in the children's traits as they grow up.  So how do you not make the last few seasons almost entirely about this story? Obviously Queen Elizabeth II is the protagonist, as the whole Diana issue is told according to the effects this had on the queen's reign. And then the series isn't called ELISABETH II... It's called The Crown ergo THE CROWN. And you can't talk about the English crown without Diana immediately coming to mind. The closer we get to the present day, the more Diana's story becomes the protagonist. The Crown series enchanted us with the reign of the young queen and all the little-known family dynamics. However, the Diana phase is necessarily at the center of the most recent royal historical events. Who knows if the English crown would have all its celebrity today if Lady D had not crossed it. Perhaps it would be an anonymous royal family like all the few others left.
Your ads give me cancer
Dominic West 😩😩😩
I can't :( im sobbing :((((
Gosh. The song mad world gave me literal chills. I am so not ready to bid farewell to this amazing series!😢
I held my breath til the end of this trailer…
The Crown is definitely ending on a very high note!!!
oof well that made me cry
Straight up disrespect from Netflix.
Elizabeth and Emma are amazing images of the late Princess Diana. Both actresses have done outstanding performances 😢😢😢 we all know the ending to this series will be heartbreaking 💔 but definitely 💯 will Honor the late Princess 👸
Part 1? They’re not even releasing the whole season?
I am so glad that Elizabeth looks so much like Diana . Also the voice is so similar to Diana's sweet deep voice ❤😢
Does anyone know the name of the song?
Already tearing up seeing this. I was so saddened by Diana's death in 97. It will be an interesting season to watch.
We Want MINDHUNTER Season 03. Please Netflix
So far...she’s the ONLY actress who’s really embody Diana, the hair, her few many instances where she is literally Diana in our eyes, she delivers the best of Princess. The only ‘off’s.. I had was they over did the under eyeing of the character, it almost painted a pic of Diana was always in submission or too shy, which is far from the truth. We want to see Diana in her full element, confident approachable and accepting of what her life had become with the Cowmilla saga. Her height was on point, Lady Di always appeared taller than most around her.  Well’..getting my 🍿🍺🧋🍪🍵🥐for the heat’s coming in the winter.☺️🫶🏽
HOW does she make those casual outfits so effortlessly chic? I try and I look like Ellen degeneres
Elizabeth Debicki surelly must love the ocean after watching first Tenet now this trailer.   C'mon give her a yacht!
Curious to see if it is also touched upon that Diana would call on the paps herself and tip them on her whereabouts and if they will show some of her questionable choices as a mother. Or will we get the usual glorification and victimization of Saint Diana?
Of all actreses who played Diana, Elizabeth nailed it! She has a resemblance to the late princess, and even her manerisms and the ways she speaks so similarly to Diana. I can't wait to watch this season.
The Monarchy killed her
Debicki is Diana. Their casting for Diana is perfection. However, I will stand by the fact that their casting of Dominic West as Charles was so so bad.
cant wait! this is going to be amazing, been watching since the beginning, one of the best shows ever!
I love Imelda, I love the image of the queen….. but this casting choice ruined the show for me. I cannot see her as this character idk why. Also, let’s hope they stop milking this train because the last season was boring, pathetic and glacial in pace.
Oh how I wish they’d use the ol’ Duck Shoot for the trailer 😢
Omg I have goosebumps
I remember moment I saw Elizabeth Debecki in The Night Manager I always thought that some day she would play Princess Diana.
That's gonna be very sad part. But I will watch it ❤
I think I will not like this season
Truly iconic. The people's princess ❤
The press killed her  Diana is not dumb enough to sit in a car with a drunk driver I didnt believe this in 1997 when I was kid watching her funeral I STILL DON'T BELIEVE IT
This is going to be a hard season to watch. I see it now. A lot of tears will be shed. Still I can’t wait for it to come out
Made me cry, not Diana’s fan, but this actress finally did her justice, England killed her after destroying her life
Elizabeth debicki should receive an award for her portrayal of diana
I am not ready at all...
Even though we all know how it ended on that night in Paris 26 years ago, this is still going to be unmissable.
I like the crown but I would like it more if they focused on the queen. The show is called the crown not monarchy. Not saying Diana and Charles isn’t important but the show is supposed to be about the queen
Netflix open the big box ! Geat Choice for this final Season . Clap Clap .
No wonder why Elizabeth Debicki  always looked strange to me... she's the spitting image of Princess Diana.
What's the name of the song she plays on the piano? And the name of the song that plays on second half of the trailer?
We all know that royalty is wrong.   This just confirms it.
I only watch the crown for the queen of England and the queen of people. The other parts, I just hope his screen time wasnt so long. Love all the actors and actresss though
So The Crown turned into The Diana Show💀
Does anyone know the name of the song playing in the background???
“Mummy are you okay? I’m okay” 💔 really hit me 😢
Gosh that took me right back to those days…😢
Is this supposed to sound like Mad World - Tears For Fears?
Çok güzel bir filim izlemenizi tavsiye ederim
I teared up just watching this trailer.
Garbage! ..... some people actually think this tripe is true!
Anyone else have tears running down their face because we know where the season is headed? 😢😢😢
Güzel Film Tavsiye Ederim 🤌👌
Give Elizabeth Debicki the Emmy now. The Academy of Television Arts and Sciences will regret to pass this golden performance by just because Charles is still sensitive about his greatest loss.
Yeah, as if King Charles had the charisma for those trailer catchphrases.
1:19 </3
I would like an alternative ending in wich Princess Diana doesn't die. ❤
So many people have commented on conversations…don’t you all realise this is a drama? No one was there to hear “it was never my intention” or any of the other quotes I’m seeing. Enjoy it for what it is, but keep it real.
in a couple of years i would love to see the next chapter of this great series...with the death of the old era and the begining of the new
What a Queen she would have been! 💔
This is going to be the saddest and hardest season
How many episodes is each part gonna be?
she was a sick women
Goosebumps!!
I have actually lost count how many times I ha e watched all 5 seasons thus far, every time a new season comes out I watch previous seasons all over again and never get sick of it
AWWWWW YEAH LETS GOOOO!
I think this bit at 1:17 is gonna be one of the Diana ghost scenes where the queen is sat after the funeral reminiscing on the future of the Windsor's and she's talking to Diana's ghost who responds basically saying, 'I never really wanted that throughout my life but I guess my existence just accidentally screwed all of your traditions.' Would be a good moment to end on for part 2 as they all look forward into the William arc.
RIP beautiful :(
Brilliant Elizabeth Debicki.
Jesus, is EVERYONE in the comments a bot? Look at the usernames and the comments. Any actual humans here at all?
The last framing is like to focus on her to get her, still living, though about to enter in eternity
There is no way elizabeth debicki is not going to sweep all the awards
Ah the finely aged tragedy and misery of other people is always an overflowing fountain of profitable entertainment…yay 🤗.
If Face and Insta would have been live that time we would still have Lady D with us.
I miss Queen Elizabeth 😔
She will definitely win globes and sag awards
i no longer trust the crown after that love letter to charles and camilla. what a disaster the last season was. the writers r in bed with the royal family to make charles looks good
Don’t nobody care anymore about Diana
YouTube channel selling
Love this series ❤
Ghastly show. Haven’t watched since the first two series. And that awful woman playing Diana. Eugh
Anlamlı harika bir film
Trailers need to do a better job of not summarising the season.
I remember the night she died. Shocking. My generation's JFK moment.
The anxiety I have got
She wasn´t victim. She was creator of interest of herself in media. And all people who read in her time newspapers with her in it worked with her on her image as superstar through their money from sale of newspaper. If people didn´t buy The sun, Daily Mail,etc. she wouldn´t be so famous and paparazzi not so interested about her.
I remember Elizabeth Debicki once said that she went for the crown season 2 audition but she didn't get the part. Look at her no,Playing one of the most important role in the same series. God's timing is always the best
I cannot believe they are going to end it with that a$$hole getting the ending. He paraded his poor son's around the world behind the body of their mother. Now, that Harry has escaped the UK won't leave him or his new family alone. Princess Diana, Prince Harry, Princess Meghan, and their children all deserve better and peace.
Damn ..... Diana really made the kingdom upside down. A true power of Reality ❤Diana.... The Queen
The writers gonna pretend the royal family had any respect at all for Di this season? Please. To quote Paul Mooney, "Prince Charles didn't want her body when it was alive but he damn near broke his neck to get it after she died." Sorry but some conspiracies are true.
epic 😮😮
I am so obsessed
Why am I getting emotional? 😭😭😭😭😭
0:49
If it is going to focus only on that delusional gold digger, then it's going to be very boring. There are so many storylines, why focus on just a failed marriage?
The scene where all the phones start ringing and lights getting on brought chills down my spine.
Splendid
Netflix: The Crown - Pornographically exploitative, rapaciously money-grubbing, devoid of even the remotest sense of any integrity, giving grotesquely inflated distortion a bad name, without quality or class, scraping the bottom of the immoral barrel, and in the end, pure plastic Americana: Irresistible...to the likes of Harry and Meghan...gotta love it, where else can one drown in such bad taste?
OMG
Top it off, queen had her murdered 😢
Journalists in Gaza accounts as Motaz Azaiza, Shaun king, wizard bisan, Mohamed el Kurd to see the truth about it, that the media keeps covering up, people are dying every hour, demand a  ceasefire now !
I'm already crying
Why is it the final season i thought it will continue till the queen’s Elizabeth II funeral the show named the crown not Diana why is it ending with the death of the princess 😢😢😢
When will this be out? Harry's wife should watch it as remember her saying she didn't know who he was when she met him 🙄... She might gain some insight
November 16th. that's my birthday
Please do not go to Paris I beg youuuu
I don’t like the way they portray Diana in these two final seasons
Bu netlix filmine bayılıyorum hem aksiyon hem heyacan bide bu filim mükemmel
❤️❤️❤️❤️
OH MY GOD ITS HAPPENING
I wish they were going to go up to the present day.
God, I wish she was still alive.
oh god no
1:11 looks like Dolorès ombrage in Harry Potter in older age !!!!!!!!
I was only 13 when Diana died, I didn't understand at the time but there really is no other like her and I'm so glad her story is being portrayed. Vale, Princess Diana
Hats off to the make-up artists, hairdressers, costume designers.
looks boring af
Lady Diana Love From Pakistan i am Crying
🥰🥰🥰🤩🤩🤩🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗
Have to say when shes on the phone it's the real one . Shivers at 32 seconds.
The Queen movie already did this well with Helen Mirren an excellent queen
i love ❤ elizabeth debicki
The series is about Diana only now? Will we get to see princess Margaret's death at all? Or in part 2?
“Paris next week?” brought the tears to my eyes…
Not a royalist but i really believe The Crown is one of the best shows ever made from Netflix
Absolute goosebumps watching this trailer
Mükemmel bir film
1:19 got me goosebumps
DIANA, IN HER ON WORD!!  😢😢😢😢
The way I got goosebumps the moment they played Mad World in the background. 2wei covers are everything.
Wonder if they'll cover how Diana also phoned the press to get them to come to some her private things.
Okay... okay... chills.
Looks like Rufus Kampa nailed it as teenage William
The lack of acting awards for s5 was very odd. Diana deserved some. They were correct in not nominating The Queen actress, she is the worst of all 3 leads. The actress herself is a grumpy individual too
I think it's distasteful how they are teasing her accident here, even with little Easter eggs like the come to Paris paper etc, like the trailer really treats it like a climax in an action movie or something instead of the tragedy that it is, I feel sorry for her son's still having to deal with shit like this
whew this is gonna be a controversial season innit
The best drama series of all time. Don't even care whether it's fact or mostly fiction at this point but they have got the end points perfectly right.
İyiye benziyor..
What about Palestinian genocide in gaza more than 7000 civilians died with in a few days😢 In this world it is forbidden to tell the truth, we know 100% israels & us government are the biggest terrorists in our planet earth but power, dollar, nuclear & propaganda programmed in our heart!!!
I think this season will leave everyone especially who witnessed Diana with a broken heart. I mean by watching only the trailer, and listening to the depiction of the sadness of her voice, the pain in her eyes and the lost in her sight....they all brought all those memories like yesterday...! Speechless, the most photographed woman and the most sad eyes that I ever seen.  RP Diana.
This will be so emotional for us.
Why is it two parts
Royal family need to own up to her murder
You cannot tell me that 0:11 isn’t Princess Diana - it’s too much like her to be Elizabeth D…This season is gonna be a tear jerker 😢
Wow. Just wow.
I CAN'T WAIT FOR THIS!!!
I was expecting the trailer for the last season to end with "Prime minister Liz Truss your majesty".
There’s no way they would include one of the royals biggest tragedies besides the queens death on the show 😩🥺😭
I'm in
This is actually quite sick. Her sons (the sane one and the victim addict) have to tolerate this, a money-grabbing company feasting on their grief. And Harry is working with them, which tells you all you need to know about him, really.
Oh joy, now all the Diana simps are gonna be back out in full force for their overrated idol. Fun 🙄
It is going to be a hard pill to swallow. Poignant
The real Queen was beautiful this one looks like a cook. Very sad
Is a bit ironic that the first three seasons were about the queen that reigned, Elizabeth, while the three last ones, were about the queen that could be, Diana.
I wish Diana had walked away after that ridiculous lunch with Camilla in season 4 e3
Sorry, I still see Umbridge.
This is going to be hard to watch 💔
I reckon Diana dies mid-season and the second half of the season is poorly recieved because they dont deal with her death well in the show
Im not prepared for LadyDi's demise TBH 😢
Not one single actor in this series delivered mediocre performance. Not ONE! Everybody brought their A-game every single episode.
This season is going to be emotional.  My mam watched the wedding of Charles and Diana and she and her children watched her funeral.  I still remember my sister waking me up and said that Diana had died.  It was like hearing a family member had passed away.  That's why she was the people's Princess.  She was loved and adored by all of the British nation and the world over, and perhaps that was the issue with the media, the world couldn't leave her alone.  She was a human being on the front line of the world's stage.
بكيت...
I cant wait any longer for this season to come out 😭😭😭 I cant wait to see what Conspiracy theories they went along with or if they went straight on facts of history 😆😆😆 so many theories where made up on Diana’s Death and the royal family has been trying to stop this season from coming out 🤭
Elizabeth Debicki deserves all the awards for her portrayal of Diana
This actually brought me to tears. Well done to everyone involved in bringing these most difficult times from that era to our screens in such a decent way.
I hope they leave the scene in where the Queen paints a tunnel on the side of a wall...
I hope the monarchy ends with Charles and William; Queen Elizabeth II despite whatever flaws she had during her reign has more sense than Charles and William combined. When Diana died it was the beginning of the end. Harry was lucky to get out even if it meant the ROTA unleashing propaganda, and a legendary smear campaign to distract from Pedo Prince Andrew's dubious ties to the most notorious trafficker Jeffery Epstein. It makes me sick that Charles and Camila succeeded in taking the throne even though they are morally corrupt and out of touch.
This is going to hurt all over again.
Diana…again
I'm getting chills
Crown is one Netflix show that has stayed consistent over the past couple of years. Looking forward to the final chapter. I wish it wasn't split in two parts but all good, the wait will be worth it.
She was truly the Queen of people’s hearts!! We so loved you. Rest in eternal peace.
Diana's end was so famous that even the show's trailer doesn't even have to do much to allude to what's coming this new season.
RIP PRINCESS ❤
No way they used the same music as Kuneho
Napoleon vs. The Crown vs. Ooppenheimer. Who wins OSCARS?
Amazing resemblance. 😶
Uncanny and heartbreaking. 💔
Now that fayed, the king and the queen is dead.
Wonder if it will have the scene where she fucks the household cavalry
This is the closest portrayal of Diana that there has ever been
Princess Diana ❤❤❤
Seeing the lights turn on at Balmoral—makes me cry knowing what that means. The call they’re getting about Diana. This trailer is perfection. Elizabeth is at the highest of her talent here. Cannot wait.
This season is going to break my heart 😭
The constant harassment from the press killed Diana. Thats why Harry is so protective of Meghan.
There should beva spinoff w them now and with Harry and Megan
This looks good! She eerily reminiscent of Diana; the voice and everything ...
I’ve heard this BGM somewhere before, Money heist I guess   But nevertheless this trailer is phenomenal and the season will be too ✨✨
Can't wait for the new season of Princess Diana.
The actress doesn't have the voice and accent of Princess Di. Is this actress Amerian Princess?
Same on society
"This is going to be the biggest thing any of us has ever seen."  26 years later, it's still the biggest event anyone has ever seen. As if no one else's untimely death can match Diana's.
This is going to emotionally cripple me.
The season everyone is waiting for but not ready for
I had no idea William and harry were so young when she passed. That’s so tragic
It’s sad cause we all know what happens but we are hoping she doesn’t get into that car anyways
A temporada que todos esperavam
Only series that Netflix actually finished
Season 4 was the last best season of these series I was really disappointed with 5. I hope the writers try and make the show come around with good finale
This is going to be really hard and sad.
Leslie Knope's political career really took off!
Spoiler Alert but guys I think Princess Diana will be dying this season
0:39 unbelievable how the press hounded Diana all her life
YES!
Slow early 00's song as per usual trailers the last few years....
The real of princess is DIANA ❤❤❤❤
can't wait!
Sad this show has just turned into the diana show
Finally!
The last scene of her will be leaving the hotel.  I'm sure they probably didn't  film a version of the "accident".
ooooooooof
They killed her.
I hope they really do diana justice this season cause last season was an attempt to kiss ass to Charles and his mistress turned queen
And now Brits and Fleet Street savage her youngest son and wife with the same hypocritical glee.
Christ the last season is gonna hurt
Diana was the villain. She lied about who she was as a person to get Charles then once married blamed him for realizing the lie
Never watched the series but the trailer gave me goosebumps. I guess it is time to start watching the whole show from the begining.
Moo moo 😢😢  I enjoying seeing that friendship
How could *anyone* that experienced these things, those of us that actually remember it all and *not support* both Harry & Meghan? All we've seen is an exact reenactment of the *same behaviors* . They learned nothing, CHARLES learned *nothing*  Burn it all down IMO!
The media destroyed her life. And now the media makes movies on how they destroyed her life.  As long as there is a market with an appetite for vulgar knowledge into private lives, the media will thrive. And Diana was also part of this corruption as she adored the media that dissolved her anonymity.
I instantly know that the accident and (maybe) funeral scenes will bring me to tears
I wonder how different this will be from The Queen, considering it's the same writer but the tone is so different.
Preparing my heart to break into tiny pieces 💔
my father got to know Princess Diana and everything he did for her my father loves London so much and taught me to love my country the same way but the actress deserves recognition for the best interpretation of Princess Diana may she rest in peace
This gave me goosebumps.
Garbage
I hope it's better than season 5, total crap
And the Royal Family learned NOTHING from what happened to Diana.
It will be interesting to see their interpretation of how the Queen dealt with Diana's death
Happy so far with this retelling of the woman I'm named after. Let's hope they stick the landing.
That "Paris Next Week?" gave me chills..
Wow 0:42 is the outfit she wore on her last day alive
This season is going to wreck me.
MY ROMAN EMPIRE
I will love this! HRH Diana forever ❤
Let's be honest here, she married a mam she barely knew, who'd just been sleeping with her sister, who was 18 years her senior, all because he was a Prince and she was ambitious and naive. She loved attention, likely due to not enough of it from her parents growing up, and thought she'd find that missing attention and affection while becoming a Princess and then a Queen. It was dumb, and later her own desire for attention turned on her. It sucks, but she entered into something huge for all the wrong reasons. It was basically an arranged marriage. Charles didn't want it either. He just assumed she would accept the reality of a royal marriage, and that he'd carry on seeing Camilla, who is her cousin, by the way. They're all related, she was a distant cousin to Charles, too. But everyone needs to stop spewing bile at Charles. He didn't want to marry her, either. He was pushed to choose someone, and fast. Diana seemed pleasant, pliant and like she'd fit the bill. If she'd had a single person in her life who cared they would have let her know that it wasn't a romantic, glamorous role. She's not the villain, nor is she entirely innocent, but the same can be said of Charles. Let's just enjoy the performances and let it go.
Omg NO we all know what happened to our princess idk want to watch it but I want to see what’s next  😫😭☹️
Oh no, they're gonna end part one with the car crash aren't they?! 😩😩
I’m not sure if this is healing or reopen wounds for her children
the royal family is gonna be so mad at this LETS GO
The Queen was the ultimate gaslighter.
Emmy performance
Elizabeth is the best Diana EVER! FINALLY an actress that not only looks like Diana, but is tall! So erie!
I can't wait any longer!
battle for dream island can come to friday 27 2023
The "Paris Next week?" note is so unbelievably cringe I feel like I'm watching Final Destination
The Season we all have longed for since this series was first announced!  I can’t wait!!! But it’ll be sad to see this journey come to an end. But this show has been amazing!
Are we gonna see the prince andrew saga too?
Very on point that the trailer song is "It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World"
This season will SHATTER viewership for Netflix because of her story. Dianas funeral was watched around the world! This is going to break records for them. ❤
It’s a British actor’s show. So I know they won’t touch upon who did it. Which was clearly the Queen or worse, her son and Mrs. Parker…..with the help of MI6….
MY GOD MY HEART CANNOT HANDLE THIS
The casting in this show is beyond. Each actor IS the person they are portraying. And Elizabeth Debicki embodies Diana like no one I’ve seen whose attempted. Absolute perfection.
princess diana is my roman empire ❤
I feel like this trailer is implying something bad is about to happen. Hopefully I don't get spoiled before it comes out.
Oh god. I can’t wait.  I’m already crying.
This trailer was absolutely chilling, wow, this show has been such a journey and even without having interest in the royal family anyone is able to see the amazing storytelling that has been achieved across 5 and soon 6 seasons, tremendous work
Bittersweet because I know it’s the end of this wonderful series but I’m excited for it..even the trailer has me emotional can’t imagine when it actually appears
The queen killer her is a fact
Still too soon, and too ghoulish, and anyone who watches this will taste the bile. Leave her memory alone, vultures.
Definitely gonna cry 😭
I’ll cry, sure
British acting at its very best 🇬🇧❤️
I truly hate the paparazzi, princess Diana was truly force of good she did not deserve the ending she got, her sons deserved to have their mother by their sides, the people deserved to have the princess who cared and Diana deserved her life her peace, she deserved so much better, the entire royal family deserved so much better. They sacrificed so much and for what for stupid crown, crown doesn't deserve the lifes it got I know something in this series that we've seen or saw over written or whatever, but for what it's worth and for what I've seen and know the crown ruined lifes not the series but the crown so many lifes could've turn and be so much better if it wasn't for the crown. I'm with excitement waiting to see the final and with sadness cuz I lnow what is coming and i hate for Henry and William to relive this moment again for the whole royal family 😢💔
LONG LIVE DIANA
enough with the crappy slowed down covers of old songs over trailers! i've had it up to here!
The final season? Noooo. I was hoping they’d go up to QEII’s passing. But still, I’ll definitely enjoy this.
Kind of don’t want it to end, but it has too🤦🏾‍♀️
I'm nervous with this final... It's definitely biggest YES!!! YES!!! One million to YES!!!
If Elizabeth Debicki doesn't get an Emmy, then this means that the whole world has gone crazy.
The crown final season part 2 will wedding, babies, Prince phipp and queen elizabeth death
that happening for Diana for world watch this and i know Paris photography or pappairizae's fault but William and Harry want all men (pH) go jail because their mother's death and murder
WOW Chills, this is the end.
1:17 this scene is Elizabeth talking to Diana's ghost. Calling it.
Ok sorry to be the rain on the parade but I'm just gonna say, in the beginning The Crown was mainly about Her Late Majesty Queen Elizabeth II and Parliament and how the 2 were linked (Sovereign and Prime Minister/Downing Street) and as we move in s5 and s6 we seem to lose that connection from the root of the show and it just doesn’t feel the same. I understand Lady Diana is popular and I adore her to heaven and back but, The Queen is the main character and for her to have a back seat in the final season of a show that was written for her is wrong. Diana shouldn't have had half the trailer length or at least should've had a second one written for her. No hate on the Princess or Elizabeth Debicki, just my personal opinion on how the crown is unrecognizable from what is was and why it was good. Currently its nothing but a glorified royal soap opera filled with half baked truths of real stories.
trailer seem alot better than the movier "SPENCER"
Looks good
I'm already crying, shit
Omg I can’t wait! Love this series. So sad that it will end. What will I do without my monarchy?
i'm not ready. flood of tears.
He really wanted to get remarried.....
They k*lled her.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
💔
Even though we know what happens, Part 1 with Diana’s death will emotionally break me.  Elizabeth Debicki has done a truely phenomenal job as Diana.
All I’m saying is they better not mess up Charles in this period
Lady Diana Francés Spencer  🌹🌹🌷🌷💕💕💕😢😢😢🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
The British who actually watch the show is going to get a lot of PTSD this season bro-
Well I will not make it through 5 minutes of this before I start bawling.
When the High Evolutionary gets it right he really gets it right.  She looks just like Diana; brilliant job!
Adan Warlock's Mother Ayesha
Can’t wait, my favorite tv show
I can’t wait to see what happens to Diana. I think she’s going to become queen. 🤔
Chills all throughout
So clever they change characters every two seasons so we can have a season 7 in like 10 years or so.
Massive lump in my throat 🥺🥺🥺
This is epic, a Fabulous Alert Level Chartreuse, the highest level I can sanction.
Rarely do I ever get chills, but for the first time in a long time….I am in awe.
All the images of that time become reality again. What a crazy world it was and how fragile Diana seemed. She was iconic and always will be.
Can’t wait let’s go ❤😂🎉😢😮😅
Let the Princess rest already. Geez, people still making money off of her even in death. RIP Princess Diana. May you rest in peace.
I need to get Netflix back
This world is shameful  Always capitalizing on the death of another  The SAME ppl that had her murdered, the same ones greenlighting making a film bout her  Smh
"Paris next week?"   CHILLS.
Okay i have no knowledge of how accurate this show is , could someone from this fanbase let me know, what percentage it is accurate ? coz i really want to start watching it but historic inaccuracies really bum me out
Oh man, is Part 1 going to end with The Car Accident?
What is this part one part two business? You've already managed to milk put two seasons over a ten year period despite condensing 60 odd years over the past seasons!
I got straight up chills during the trailer. I hope season 6 is better scrited than season 5. Season 5 lacked something in my opinion but i have a feeling Season 6 will be amazing. It's covering an extremely emotional historical event. The casting is on point. Can't wait.
I can already tell the tunnel scene will turn me into a sobbing MESS!
LITERAL CHILLS
The fuckin press killed this poor woman
This looks fantastic. Got a little choked up during the trailer to be honest. Can't wait for the final season.
ELIZABETH DEBICKI THE WOMAN YOU ARE
The Crown deserves another season with Queen’s passing-it will feel complete and be in sync with one crown end to allow another to begin
This gave me goosebumps. That’s how good it is 😅❤
I can't watch this bc I'm always gonna hope the ending is different
Till this day I remember where I was when I heard about Princess Diana's death. This season is going to be heartbreaking to watch.
I want to see this so bad when it comes out! But, I can't pay Netflix's raised prices!
give elizabeth her oscar
I'm going to cry in this season.  We all know what happens to our Beloved Princess.  Diana, You are the Queen of Hearts. You are still Missed.
Elizabeth really captured Diana that it's like watching her all over again and knowing how Diana's story ends...going to be a mess all over again when it happens.
no matter how many times i watch the tv show or watch its trailers, I can’t help but get into this adrenaline rush! The elegance, intrigue, and magic, it’s all just outstanding!
For anybody curious, the song in the trailer is "Mad World" by 2WEI and Tommee Profitt
I'm gonna cry so much when they'll release it 😭😭
Diana was not always the innocent victim she liked to portray herself
This trailer gave me straight up goosebumps. I have a feeling part 1 is going to be very emotional.
This is how you end a series, you end it because the story ends not because of ratings…
Listen season 5 I didn't watch plus I heard it wasn't good anyways but imma be tuning in with this I'm excited😊👍🏽😩👀
Elizabeth Debicki and Emma Corrin were both absolutely awesome as Princess Diana. Diana was a truly remarkable woman of Higher Christ Consciousness. Her love, compassion and kindness continue to ripple around the world, through all people to this day.💚🤍💛👏🏻👏🏻💯💯
For those of us who witnessed her life; her passing is etched in our journey. Stunned silence for weeks or at least, that's how it felt. She was the best of them.
Jesus the way they captured the madness of living a life like that is astounding. Great shots
hopefully it will be better and more compellingly written than the last season
So to end the Diana People's Love Affair the Royals had her murdered so Prince Charles could eventually marry his true love!!
There are several renditions of Princess Diana by different actors and I think Debicki here has the closest resemblance, especially the prominent bone structure.

Amazing! Can’t wait!
This is so heartbreaking 😭
I can't wait for this princess dianas  legacy lives on through her boys and her grandchildren
the resemblance is uncanny
Okay, but imagine someone younger who doesn't know how it sadly ends watching this... the plot twists...
I teared up revisiting the lead up to her devastating death, her boys must be shivering watching this trailer, she really became bigger than the crown , and is undisputably a once in a lifetime.. ❤
Fine I'll finish Season 5
It wasn't a life size inflatable model of ET, it was a life size inflatable model of ALF.
This feels kind of gross? I don't know, probably a me thing because these are the first events they've covered in my living memory.
This show is undoubtadly one of my favourites of all time, such an artistic, yet heartfelt and complex way of portraying these timeless personalities. Elizabeth Debeki exudes imense empathy, an aspect I've always related Diana. Hope this is a new win and an masterful finale for the Crown Team 👑
I feel for will and Harry watching this
I’ve been waiting on this, started my marathon of rewatching the whole series
really disappointed how this show went from being about the whole family to just diana now. 😔 her story has been done enough already.
Elizabeth Debicki is insaneeeeee
They never wanted her to find peace. If they did they would have protected her. As long as the sons are protected and the wives thrown under the bus this was going to happen. Charles was allowed to have an affair but once she stepped out they fed her to the wolves. Crown over human kindness. I hope the final season doesn't make Charles out to be a champion. He had a huge hand in how her life ended.
Oh I'm gonna cry.. I just know it.
She was the queen the world wanted. Unfortunately her husband does not. More than half the planet, those of us who lived through those years, remember the moment we found out that Diana died. Beyond the fact that the world loved her, Diana was ahead of her time and today we are seeing that in the royal family itself. She won.
that was just chilling..
It’s scary how much Elizabeth debicki looked like Princess Diana in this trailer! For a moment you think it’s really her!! As much as this finale is anticipated, as much as it’s a very sad knowing she will pass away so early 😢
Princess in the people’s heart forever ❤ She would have been an amazing and the most loved QUEEN 👸  Miss her..
At 1:12 I think it's Diana's ghost already
Please make it stop
I never was interested in crown but Elizabeth debiki is gonna make me watch it all now
Oh man the tragedy here we come. Oh man surely know will cry alright😭😭😭 The tragedy of summer 97. I didn’t know Diana on her death was on August of 97. Thought she died when was back in school on September. Reason didn’t know was because was already dealing with a tragedy where my mom died of cancer in July 1997 so was still processing on it when was only 13.  Even though the tragedy is very different, I feel a lot on William and Harry pain on losing a mom at such a young age even though yes not met them in person.
Saddened me even before her death just how endlessly broken she always appeared...
I love the show the crown I was born three days after Princess Diana‘s death in a way I feel like it was her giving new children a way to be born in this world even though I will never ever get to see her though I wish I could go back in time and be alive to see her. At least we got to see her children grow up them to get married, and have children of their own, one day, we will all be able to see her in the heavens above, and I know every day she’s smiling down on all of us no matter what we all do no matter what her children have done. She knows that they know that they love her and she loves them no matter what, I watch the documentary the seven days after Diana said it was so heartbreaking. It was so gut, wrenching and so sad. It was like losing somebody that I will never ever known. We all know Diana in someway from her style to how she treats people kind and respect the queen of peoples hearts, always, and forever.
I was born in 1996 and still miss Diana! It's going to be heartbreaking to see her death as if it were real this time 💔
I look at this and feel so much heart ache for her. She was before my time but I’m so thankful to the individuals who hold her legacy and will do so for our queen. It’s truly heartbreaking to see the amount of pressure she was under all because of public opinion. We seriously need to think before we speak because she was a beautiful individual who didn’t deserve the treatment she faced.
I would love something like where in the end Claire Foy and Olivia Colman visit Imelda Staunton in a dream or so, to reflect on a job well done!
Season 5 of the Crown was honestly a disappointment. The writing, directing, and acting weren’t not as great as the last 4 seasons. The main characters barely had any screen time. It was not compelling & absorbing. There was way too much emphasis on the irrelevant side characters & other unknown civilians. I hope this final season will be great again.
November 16 will be a day of cry for me
Since I saw Debicki at the premiere of The Great Gatsby I dreamed that she’ll play Diana some day. You can imagine my scream when The Crown has announced that she’ll play Diana in season 5 and 6. I knew she’d be amazing!! Can’t wait to see her in final season.
Had been waiting for this finale for a long time. The Crown is THE BEST series on Netflix.
Why when one does somthing does everybody start copying?
Esta temporada promete ser de las mejores, pero al mismo tiempo la más desgarradora.
Can't wait!!!!!
can't wait.
Princess Diana is the Queen of our Hearts❤️
J.esus Christ Returns, repent of sin and OBEY the LAW of the Father...   Y..A,,H.. is a egipt ....D,EMON, BEWARE ... (HalleluJAH is a PAGAN word)
This will be such a sad season. And yet sooo oddly realistic! (In a way)
As a child the only time I ever saw my father cry was the day after Diana passed. He just silently shed tears while taking me to school. I had never even heard of her but I saw the impact she left behind, even in rural NH.
1:49 goosebumps! A tear dropped down from my eye
Where is the part of William and Kate?    That’s why I’m watching.
😢crying crying crying crying CRYING CRYING CRYING crying crying !!! When William said "Mummy" in that broken voice... You KNOW what comes after THAT scene !!! 😭😭😭   and also the quick scenes of her and Dodi getting into the car... Bit by bit, towards that final curtain call for our sweet Diana, that made me BELLOW in howling tears omfg 😭😭😭🙏❤️💔💔💔   also that Side eye Diana gives to Queen Liz "You've brought this house under" ... "I didn't intend to 🙄" DAAAAMN !!!!!  THIS FIRST PART WILL BE THE SADDEST, MOST HEART BREAKING SEASON WE WILL WITNESS YET💔💔💔  ATLEAST we will end the entire journey after all these years with reflection to happier royal memories, William and Kate and Charles & Camillas wedding, Queens golden jubilee!!!! 👏👏👏✨✨✨😎👌🙏  Counting down the days..... BEST. CHRISTMAS. EVER.  can't wait till a few years from now when they feel comfortable to tackle wills and Kate wedding and that era onward, won't likely see a depicted later future season growing closer to the Queen's passing for ATLEAST a decade!!! The creators said they need some time between events (a few years) so it's not as controversial and they have a full idea and understanding of said events being depicted, makes sense, very honorable !!!! 👏👏👏 we'll put!!!   This is just the end of the 20th century royal family seasons .... Just wait! It'll come back and that season 7 trailer will likely start with Harry's party days, will and Kate's wedding, Queens diamond and Sapphire jubilee !!!! .... it'll likely end in Season 8, the last episode... CROWNING CHARLES !!! 💥💥💥   ...Ha, I'm just way to obsessed with the royal family my hopes are UP 😅✌️👌 NO OTHER SHOW OR MOVIE HAS REPRESENTED THE ROYAL FAMILY BETTER !!! I SAY THIS AS A LIFELONG LOYAL ROYAL FAN ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️   GOD SAVE THE KING !!!!  GOD BLESS Y'ALL FELLOW ROYAL FAMILY LOVERS 😁✌️❤️
We need the music ! Great trailer !
Season 5 was way too bad. I don’t have much hopes for this one tbh.
Diana might be dead on episode 2, 3 at most but of course the first part was going to be about her. I am also glad they are showing Charles affected by her death, for that was the case, and the scene where they receive the famous call notifying them about her accident. Charles went over the roof to get there, she died I think before he could get to Paris sadly but he brought her back.
Elizabeth D has nailed all of the right mannerisms… such a great performance.   I know the network will catch hell if there really is a ‘ghost’ but this would not be the first time that concept has been put forth. Diana’s ghost played a major part in a play adaptation a few years ago. I don’t think it’s poor taste but I do hope that the creative license tries to do some good with it… since it’s already going there, maybe show her reaction to the enormous international outpouring of love/grief, maybe show her saying goodbye to her sons and saying how proud she is of them, maybe show a short conversation with Frances, if feeling spicy show a conversation with Camilla, maybe use the ‘ghost’ to help folks get closure all these many years later. Just a thought.   I’m gonna be sad when this series finally says goodbye.
Heartbreaking
What made this series shit is that they spent 3 seasons focusing only on Diana
In tears already.
0:37 in and we who lived it saying bull💩
Omfg i cant wait
This chick is so much hotter than diana
Looks amazing! The first 4 episodes will obviously deal with Diana and her death but after that I'm sure the focus will return to the Queen ❤
This is just the trailer, and I'm already crying. I'm going to be heartbroken again, I think. I was in my twenties, and I remember that time so well. 😭💔
The scene of the castle lighting uo and ringing iff aftw rher death gave me chills. I remember seeing ut in a movie about her too. All of engaknd lit uo within a minute they say
I’m not ready for Diana’s death😢
Come November 16 come, I hope I just sleep and wake up on that day. I can't wait ❤❤❤❤
i am so ready i am so ready i am so ready
This is the moment The Queens public approval dropped quite considerably for the first time in the UK, when she prioritised her grandchildren's welfare over the public mourning of Diana. I respect her so much for doing that. Looking back it was hysteria over Diana and The Queen absolutely made the right decision. But it demonstrates the very personal challenges of the needs of The Crown and her own personal families needs. A fantastic way to end the series.
I literally got goosebumps all over from this. This will be so sad and the tension unbearable. 😭
Poor Harry can’t catch a break
Will they use the real or fictional event in the Paris tunnel?
Mad World?
Still cannot believe this series is ending. Peter Morgan struck gold with this show! Cannot wait to see what he will do next. As for the cast, Elizabeth Debicki's portrayal of Diana deserves all the praise in the world!
Diana will be one of the most iconic figures in history. I think her story will be told over and over again for generations to come, in that way she has achieved a level of impact and influence over human history others can only wish to have.
00:35 Spencer Movie Vibe?
👍
I had no idea it would continue. I literally thought it's over.
She did an amazing job as Diana
I got a feeling Netflix will break records with this.
Liz going to get that Emmy and golden globe
Why the last season?!!!
It's like the Queen movie with Hellen Mirren from 2006, isn't it? 😮
Please Netflix, go there. You know what I’m talking about, just have the balls.
I think they should have stopped ages ago. Is too fictional with real personal stuff. I hope Princes William and Harry are not too distressed by this invasion of privacy with fiction.
So season 6 part 1 its basically the movie The Queen
Elizabeth Debicki deserves an Emmy for this role. The sheer intensity and depth of how she had to morph herself into Diana is insane! Diana was so distinct; her speech, mannerisms , quirks.... Can you imagine how much time, dedication and effort it took to learn those and then perform them so nonchalantly and naturally? This has to be the best portrayal of Diana I have ever seen.
Please make a Seventh Season!!!
Can’t wait to watch this part one
woh can't wait to see the final season ! i'm really going to miss The Crown
As much as I love this series, I've been dreading this one event. I hope it is as resting too, as it's going to be detailed.
I remember in 1981, all of the hype over Charles and Diana’s wedding.  I was an 18 year old going to community college and was a little ticked off that my government teacher assigned us to watch the Royal Wedding and write a paper on it.   I complained to my dad about it and he pointed out that I should watch it because I was a history buff and this wedding was going to historic. So I got up at 5AM to watch it on tv.  I remember hoping there wouldn’t be a bombing or an assassination.  After all, we had Lennon, Reagan, Sadat and Pope John Paul being shot.  Thankfully, it didn’t happen. So I wrote my paper, turned it in and got on with my life.  I had a lot of growing up to do. But over the years, I’d hear or see stories on the  tv news about Charles and Diana or see the tabloids as the stores.  The birth of William and Harry, Charles and Diana at Live Aid, their separation, Diana’s interview with Martin Bashir, their divorce.  It was hard to escape the coverage. In 1997, I was at the bar hanging out with my friends when one of our group showed up, a shocked look on his face. “You guys aren’t going to believe this. Lady Diana is dead.”  Our reaction was “Really.  Wow!”  Then we went back to talking about whatever we were talking about. But as the night rolled on, all of the TVs in the bar which normally showed sports, started showing footage of Diana. This is going to be big, I thought.   Very big. The next day, I watched as Charles bought Diana’s body home from Paris and made a decision to stop watching the news all together because it was going to be all Diana all the time until her funeral. So I stopped watching the news until the following Friday when The Queen gave her national address. Then I got up in the morning early to watch the funeral. It was as big as some of footage I’ve seen of JFKs funeral.  Maybe even bigger.  And it was historic too. After that, I went on with my life and The Royal Family fell into the background again.  One night when my dad was in the hospital, I rented The Queen for my,om to get her mind off things and found it fascinating.  More years passed and The Royals few into the background except for the occasional news stories about William getting married, Harry getting into trouble and Charles marrying Camilla.  Life goes on I guess  Six years ago, I signed onto Netflix and the featured item on the home page was for The Crown. I had heard of the show but had little interest.  It started playing and I decided to give it five minutes and I was hooked.  It wasn’t just a well written or well produced show, it was history and I was still a history buff. I would watch and episode and then look up what really happened on my tablet.  It hasn’t disappointed yet. Sorry to see it end.
Boring music this time
For anyone wondering where the music is from, it’s a remix of Mad World by 2WEI, Fleurie & Tommee Profitt
cant wait for it 💕
I actually got teary-eyed watching that trailer.
Oh god, it's going to be devastating to watch it happen all over again.
Thier most dramatic season yet..... Still hoping they would do a meghan markle 🤣😂🤣
Netflix raises their prices every 6 months and we're paying $25 a month for this garbage.
i m waiting for this eagerly
I know there is a lot of drama with the royal family but every time I see stuff like this, that just dramatizes their lives, all I can think is how exploitative it is and I feel sorry for the whole family, because at the end of the day they’re just people.
I was a huge fan for very long, but season 5.. Idk if it was actually weaker or if it was just that they were getting into such well-known territory. Well, the cast was a bit weaker. Elizabeth Debicki to me wasn't as good as Emma Corrin or Kirsten Stewart, and still doesn't seem to have Diana's voice quite down. Haven't decided if I'll watch this.
Next on "The Diana Show"
We still love you DIANA ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I heard Harry asked them not to do this season years ago with the death of his mother but changed his mind so they proceeded (I work in production). I wonder what made him change his mind. Perhaps to show the world who his mother was in another way one last time.
So emotional when Diana talks to her sons on the phone🥲🥹
Chills from watching this because we know whats coming and it’s heartbreaking. Had her death not happened, William and Harry might not have been at war like they are now.
1:49 William 💔😭😭
Omg!!! The Royally devastating finale😢can't wait to see...Huge applause to Elizabeth Debicki and Dominic West for portraying such amazing characters👏
They are milking this show dry now
Part 1 🤢 Part 2 🤮 this trend is ridiculous
The most tragic season of all and the trailer is giving me chills... I was 17 when Diana was cruelly taken from us, so this season will hit harder than previous ones... the shock, disbelief and heartbreak of hearing the news was palpable. Diana was beautiful inside and out. The whole cast of this show has been phenomenal... portraying the Royal Family, especially Diana is a huge task but it has been outstanding.
C'MON NETFLIX!!!   GREEN-LIGHT THAT PREQUEL PETER MORGAN HAS IN MIND!!! C'MON!!!!!
Anyone know who the Cover is by?
what happens next?
0:56 goosebumps from here till the end of the trailer
I can’t wait!!!❤️🫶🏻
I thought the final season would be around 2-3 seasons later and would end with Queen Elizabeth II’s death last year.
The mother of a future King should NOT have been cavorting on a yacht, arching her back for photographers. Disgusting. She had many virtues but absolutely no shame.
😮
They ruined it with dominic playing Charles. He's nothing like him and too well known. The actress playing Diana captures her brilliantly
1:19 when all the lights turned on with the telephone ringing at Balmoral…  Just chills on my skin…  We all know what has happened…
Liked her role in the wheel of time.
This season is gotta focus on Diana’s death, 9/11, prince William’s first year at college, Queen Elizabeth’s golden jubilee, deaths of princess margaret, queen mum
It looks like The Queen (2006) is getting a thorough revisit.  Wow.
hate the part 1 and part 2 crap from Netflix. They better step it up this final season because season 5 was meh
Trixie and Katya have new content 👑
Wow. This actress is good. But, I can’t get passed how badly cast Queen and Charles are. So detached from reality, unlike s1-4. It really I think the story which was so perfectly told in THE QUEEN with Helen Meiren, was the story to tell. Shows how the response to Diana’s death was truly hated. And threatened the Queen’s reign more than anything in decades,nor since. I don’t know if this was the right call.
this series is perfect i'm impress in how Elizabeth Debicki really looks like Diana, only this teaser gave me chills the person who did this deserves a raise, the emmy and even an oscar...can not wait for this epic finale
I remember the day Princess Di died. My mom was screaming into the phone at her friend in shock. I was 7 or 8 years old.
Chills wow so excited to see this
I felt so bad 😔 well they will show that the paparazzi is the cause of the death of princess d not the royal family and not Camilla and Charles 😢😢😢
song?
i cant believe s4 dropped in 2020 and i was 13 now im 16 and its the last seaso,,,
*Good, Part 1 can give the Princess Diana moment to everyone who wants it, so Part 2 can give the rest of us the story after it. XOXO ;)*
That shot of all the lights in the house coming on one at a time with the phones ringing took my breath away. What a perfect way of communicating exactly what just happened in the timeline.
If you understand what is happening in the scene at 1:18, it will give you goosebumps.
They could still do two more seasons. I think it’s appropriate to end it with the end of Elizabeth II’s reign
Who sings this version of Mad World?
My dad works at the hospital and he was there when Diana passed and yeah… let me tell you he knows some stuff.
I want to see the scene where Queen Elizabeth is on the phone with the driver and she says "....Do it." And hangs up the phone
The Crown has lost its essence since it shifted the focus to Diana and Charles.
can some1 tell me this songs name???
oh this will break me, i just know it
Her death was the hardest on her sons more than the public ever cared when the paparazzi never left her alone
Season 5 did not  top Season 4. Hope this Final season  is the greatest one to mske Netflix remembered for 2023.
Netflix I’m a huge fan of the crown and am thrilled that we will get both parts in quick succession. However, why is Bridgerton being moved all the way to next spring/summer to accommodate this!?! Justice for Polin!! We’ve waiting long enough for season 3! Kindly reconsider this. Thank you…a concerned fan
Good thing we learned our lesson about invasive paparazzi eh?
I wish Christopher Hitchens was here to watch this. 🍿
They should end the series with the birth of George.
Honestly my jawdropped with the iconography used in this trailer...  Just incredible & it's only Part 1 officially.  Really hope some of the episodes are an hour+ long to really sell the Story that we are about to be witnesses too 🙌🏻!
Wow, I can't believe... such important visual details were shown about the Princess... starting from the eyes, piercing gaze, that tone of her voice, and ending with her posture... What a brilliant actress is Elizabeth Debicki
But Morgan already dramatized this!!!
Will they also show how they got her killed too?
It feels as if the Royal Family envied Diana so much, because she was an outsider, but she was the only one of them who was every truely loved and admired by the nation and the whole world.
😢
Is the show going to finally be accurate or are they going to continue with the lies and disinformation.
I understand why they're stopping here. But I can already tell, I'm going to want more at the end of this. Can we petition that they call it a PAUSE and revisit some of today's storyline in 10-15 years? Give me hope?
It's creepy how much Elizabeth looks like Diana in some shots.  For a moment you think it's really her.  Elizabeth deserves a Golden Globe for Best Actress.
I feel like I should be prepared for heartbreak to watch this season.
Gosh, this trailer must be horrible to watch for William and Harry. I felt it!! 😢
You can watch the last 24 hours of Diana’s life through the eyes of a CCTV camera almost scene for scene. It’s a very disturbing poetic poem that almost begins and ends with the same opening - Paparazzi and flashing lights.
It seems to be better than the Season 5, cause let me tell you it was a whole mess that I didn't understand compared to the previous seasons that were masterpieces ....
I'm so not ready for this, but I will watch, and will honestly probably cry🥺 Thank you, Netflix!
THIS SERIES IS ON FIRE 🔥Fingers crossed this season is gonna be a fantastic adaptation of "the Queen" (2006) 👑
Studios will reportedly stop negotiating with SAG-AFTRA until January unless they get a deal in the next week.  This is a tactic by studios to put pressure on the union to take a deal. SAG can wait for the deal they deserve as long as it takes.
This season is gonna be heartbreaking. I can't forget how the papparazi killed her and got away with it.
I suspect people have already starting to this, but now I ‘m just thinking of the comparisons between how this and The Queen depicted this event.
Brill
1:09 Calling it now, The Queen is talking to Diana’s ghost after her death
That one last scene on the car before Diana.. passed away will be a hell of a scene and we will cry, am sure.
This trailer gave me goosebumps... I LOVE it
I never watched this show but now I think I'll binge-watch it from the beginning since I've always had a fascination with the late Princess Diana even though I was born in 1998, a year after her death.
Were not ready
That black queen dress is giving me a lil stress... There will be too many deaths in this season😢
Elizabeth and Emma have done just such a brilliant job as Diana. Long may Diana's memory live in our hearts!
The Crown never disappoints with all their trailer. Brilliantly edited.
Now its just getting silly.
Wow!
Fair Well to The Princess
Okay i got goosebumps. We miss The People's Princess 😢
It looks like they might show the car crash after all 🤔
The last scene should have been her diving into the water.  Nothing against the trailer. It was perfect. Just my thought.
I cannot wait for this. Best show on any streaming service right now.
The first part of the final season is gonna be heart wrenching, especially for those of us who were there when it all happened.
SO HYPED
So I don't watch this show because I'm not paying to watch monarchist propaganda, but I vividly remember the events of 97, and I did feel a certain chill at how this trailer evoked them.
Too hard to watch.... they obviously killed her 😢
Not easy being Paris Hilton.
God Save The Queen
“That was never my intention.” I wonder if that is her ghost.  I’m in tears.
This show is straight up the peak of what television can offer as an artform. It's been such a journey and I hate to see it go but I'm glad they'll get to close out the story they wanted to and go out on top 🙏👑
Goosebumps
She is still rocking their world years after her death, that's power.
Diana cheated on her husband and deserved what happened to her 🤷‍♂
Such a sad sad story.
I'm so grateful that this series will open upcoming generation's eyes to reality of a woman who wanted nothing but love and acceptance. Every second of this trailer sent a chill down my spine. I was bawling my eyes out at the end. Princess Diana will forever be in our hearts. Her voice will never go out of existence. She was a woman of grace, dignity, kindness. Kudos to the brilliant cast. Claire foy, Vanessa Kirby, Imelda Staunton, Elisabeth Debicki, Helna Carter, Olivia Coleman and Emma Corrin Nailed It! One of my all time favourite shows. Can't wait for this masterpiece!
Excited but overall, to me, the series became less interesting as the Diana era started. Feels too recent and I enjoyed the historical period more, were Britain’s and the crown’s role in the world was a theme too…
I just can't wait for the last season! and then of course I will cancel Netflix 🤫
I can already feel how absolutely heartbroken I m going to be with the last seasons storyline. What a wonderful and remarkable series The Crown has been. Going to miss it dearly when it comes to it's end.
I’ve been rewatching the Season 5 trailer recently and I’m so happy the new trailer is finally here! Also, the first poster was epic.
I got goosebumps from that 😢I don’t want it to end
never been so early for a netflix trailer
This is the last season of The Crown right? I wished they had skipped this chapter since the movie The Queen had already covered this part of Her Majesty's life.
Oh man. That phone call. This season is going to break our hearts. Still wondering how they will portray the car crash. Because the absolute best way, would be just showing Diana getting in the car, chased by the paparazzi, then cutting to black. And showing the rest from the POV of everyone else.
I am definitely not ready for this heart aching season!! 💔
No one tell me what happens I am not caught up yet
No government in any country right now has any effect on what Amazon is accomplishing with their *ACM23X* hope you know that. If you dont know that youll end up with delusions all night long
No government in any country right now has any effect on what Amazon is accomplishing with their *ACM23X* hope you know that. If you dont know that youll end up with delusions all night long
Whats stopping you from being a part of Amazons *ACM23X* when everything else is literally trying to take your last penny? Guess what, living costs wont decrease even after that war is over
Wait, Diana dies? Oh great, spoiler alert.
No government in any country right now has any effect on what Amazon is accomplishing with their *ACM23X* hope you know that. If you dont know that youll end up with delusions all night long

I seriously can’t wait to cry my eyes out 😭
Is it on netflix now?????
2:00 That shot, she indeed looks like a Princess.
Waiting so much!
wooow i just go chills!!! i cannot wait for this enough
Con lagimas en los ojos debo decir que esta temporada sera la mas dificil de ver
Okay so we are going with the storyline that the Royal family didn't have Diana offed in that tunnel that fateful night in Paris, France with the Palestinian gentleman. Cool... 😮
My tissue is ready, I know I'm gonna cry a whole lot
The first part is all Diana!!Can't wait!!! There's no way that Diana met the Queen after the divorce.
This is my favorite Netflix series and excited to see it go out on a good note. Sad part is I don’t think there is another series that can fill the void this one will leave. Thanks to everyone (cast, crew, etc,) that worked on this series for the past several years!
MY GOD ELIZABETH IS WOW IM SO EMBARRASSED TO SAY IVE NEVER SEEN HER FILMS BUT I AM SO GLAD THEY CASTED HER FOR THIS ROLE SHE DID HER JOB AMAZINGLY SHE IS WITHOUT A DOUBT PHENOMENAL MY  HEART IS GONNA HURT THO WATCHING THIS SEASON RIP OUR BEAUTIFUL DIANA 😇🙏🏼🥺🤍
So we're gonna ignore Elizabeth? More Charles Diana drama?
Elizabeth Debicki will be a great Princess Diana.  But the Princess Diana story remains to me a fairly uninteresting part of the story of the Crown
OMLLL
i can't wait!!! But am a little sad this series is ending 🥲
Oh dear.   It's going to be one big crazy fest of worship of goddess Diana.  👋 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿's 🥀       🎹       😂
Don't drink and drive.
Last season? Not sure about that..
I wish she was still alive. I wonder how they’ll portray her death. Long live Princess Diana
Old Royal family were not ready for her.
cannot wait to watch it, and i also don't want it to be over too!
Spoiler alert... she dies
"Paris next week?" NAAAAUUUURRRRRRRRRRR, PRINCESS, I DEMAND YOU DECLINE
crying
1:49 Wait a minute. I thought they're not going to recreate the accident scene because it's very sensive and a very touchy subject.
Is it just me or is Elizabeth Debicki type cast as the wife of a billionaire who wants to get out of that relationship? The Night Manager, Tenet and The Crown.
Chills!! This is going to be devastating and haunting.
❤❤It's a delight to see Diana represented in a marvel job by Elizabeth Debicki🤍🤍🤍
Can't wait.
*I remember exactly what I was doing when I heard 👑Princess of Wales, Diana died. I adored her all the way in Detroit MI.  I still miss her and the impact she could have had today.* 💔❤‍🩹
Eliz Debicki Is fantastic ❤
All I wish for is the UK have a labour party like trifecta government for 20+ years.   Not so much a fan of Diana.  Im U.S. citizen.
FINALLY!!!😭😭😭
The way Elizabeth Debicki's audition for The Crown Season 2 was rejected and now here she is playing one of the most iconic figures of all time is absolutely incredible
I'm not ready to say goodbye again 😭
Looks much better than Season 5
Was Princess Di 9 feet tall? Because I don’t mind remembering her that way.
Diana ❤❤❤
Oh my god, shivers! 😩🤍
I feel like they could have gone one more season, considering all the recent Harry/Meghan/Kate/William drama. Excited for this regardless.
considering everything that has happened since last season this one is going to feel different watching
there's a bit in the trailer where the queen is talking to Diana I wonder if that in her mind based on the way it seems to be shot, I imagine after everything the queen probably did speak to Diana in her mind at least a little bit
Diana would’ve been an awesome granny to George, Charlotte and Louis. 🙌
wtf is this shit with part 1 and part 2.
really love the choice of background song for the trailer really sums this all up I think
OMG 😮 CAN’T WAIT!!! ❤👑
I’d been dreading the arrival of this season because of what it covers but I’ll be watching.
The British press are gonna lose their shit, given the fact the trailer alone implies the fact that they have Diana's blood on their hands
So eery hearing her sounding just like Diana.
Can clearly see the crown arraging everything in the name of the crown itself and its survival
Amazing trailer. What song is this?
I'm not ready!
It’s gonna be good
Elizabeth Debicki should be the only actress to play Princess Diana in movies. It’s a near uncanny resemblance
I hope we can get some sort of interview where Claire Foy, Olivia Colman, and Imelda Staunton sit down together and talk about basically anything about Queen Elizabeth herself. That'd be awesome, Elizabeth herself would've been so proud of these talented actresses portraying her
I can’t wait 💔
I Can’t wait !!!
The way this trailer focused mostly on Princess Diana showcase that she's the Royal Family icon that's absolutely timeless and will never be forgotten. I was born right after she passed away yet i missed her so much 😢
"what do people want from me", when I heard that, my heart sank. It's where I know, this season will cover, her death 😭
Can't wait. Watched the series up to now!! I'm all in.😂
God I'm so not ready for this 😢
Se ve muy buena 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The Crown season 6: Prepare your tears
Why is this the finale because they could continue with King Charles' story
Hoping the best finale ❤
"This is gonna be the biggest thing any of us has ever seen."  And it was. It was.  Your soul will always shine, Princess.
Finally season 6
Love this
If Diana were alive today she’d be the same age as my mum. My mum would’ve been only two months her senior.
Elizabeth Debicki is the most perfect actress to play Princess Diana in the 1990s. Diana would've been so proud to see what Debicki had accomplished with her role. I'm scared to see how they're gonna handle her final year, it's going to be so heartbreaking
Diana 4 ever ❤
We all know what’s gonna happen next. Im just not ready!! 😭 + It’s quite scary to see how Elizabeth Debicki really looks like Princess Diana…she’s such a good actress! 🫶
paris next week... wow crazy
This show is going down so bad I honestly loved it until season 4 but now everything is random and complicated
Oh God…
Hmmmm
It's gonna be an emotional ride
At last.....😭
Когда выйдет кобра кай 6 сезон?
Haven't watched for a season or two but I will be tuning in for this.
This is going to be an incredible finale. I know it!
Wtf
