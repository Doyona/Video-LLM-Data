HERE WE GO PEOPLE THE GROUND HAS BEEN BROKEN, sign up to be a channel member and see a sneak peak on Sunday of progress so far. Also got a new Tee in the Furze Merch store https://www.colinfurzeshop.com Thanks for watching and hope you enjoy it all.
8:11 Close your eyes, now you hear Mumbo Jumbo just after a timelapse stopping to explaining a bit of his project...
Brother I just got to be honest I don't ever see this actually working out. And I sure hope you don't think people will actually care. They'll never actually give your channel a monster boost. One that changes your beautiful family and your lives! Nah never happen 🤣 Seriously I'm so proud of you. And happy for you as well. You're a great man Mr. Colin. Much respect sir 🙏.
Hi Colin, I'm coming from Sorta Food. Interesting idea and I'm enjoying the content. From Southern US.
10:15 Wait a tick…did I hear that right? Did he just say that it’s taken 10 months just to make the amount of progress as shown thus far? 😲
The problem of all the spoil 🙄......sell it ! ,but who would buy it ? Me 😅😅. Mr Furze you are an inspiration.
I just subscribed because he left dirt at the grocery store 😂
I feel bad for the guy who got that box of cereal
brilliant fun!
Have figured out where the draft is coming from?
If he were my son, I'd be very proud of him. That said, that awful head-banging music would have to change.
just one question, what does he do with all the dirt and shit
Cool! but coming from an underground miner people should be aware of how deadly confined spaces can be and also should be much more ground support the screen/mesh should be secured throughout all sides. Going into any tunnel, enclosed space can become oxygen deprived or toxic for many reasons if it’s left unattended and it only takes seconds to drop a person
I wonder what advice 2025 Colin would give to 2020 Colin on digging this tunnel.
I've always thought why hasn't anyone done this before and i'm so glad I found this channel lol
This crack was certainly not meant to be found. Ever.
Common Colin , nice job mate :)
here watching from the begining in 2024. covid was weird.
The more i watch the more I get the feeling that his neighbours will notice eventually
"News today about a man who was arrested because of suspicious packages he left in various areas."
well...he decided to build his own hydraulic digging tool, so I had no choice but to subscribe.  I thought I was a mad-lad building ANYTHING out of wood.  but this genius builds whatever the **** he wants to.  respect
"we have to be quiet" *grinder noise* *welding noise* xD :P
I’m sorry: did you just say that corner is nice and square no no: it’s not it’s not a square at all. It’s really rather rounded in shock be looking.
The stuff in between your surface gravel and your lime stone is clay very thick occasionally rock strewn clay it’s very hard to dig, and it’s very heavy
OK so I realize that this video is two years old and so you probably might not notice this message but speaking as an archaeologist who lives in America in the state of Kansas, your walls are deplorable, sir they are supposed to be straight up and down smooth, not with all the waves and ripples, you should be able to take a plum bob from the top, hang it straight down, put a line level on it and make it be beautifully straight tsk tsk tsktsk tsk tsk other than that I honestly I’m really loving watching your videos
What if you encounter water, watercourses? How do you deal with it?
Brothers of the mine rejoice! Swing, swing, swing with me Raise your pick and raise your voice! Sing, sing, sing with me Down and down into the deep Who knows what we'll find beneath?

So much garbage music makes all these videos unwatchable.
great
this guy is the only one ive ever seen do labour intense jobs in shorts ,short sleeve button up shirt and a tie ,What a MADMAN
But where did the draft come from?
I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole ! Diggy diggy hole, diggy diggy hole !!
Bs all aside, this guy is a hard worker.
Do you need planning permission for something like this? What happens when you want to sell the house?
real-world minecraft
😂😂
No shoring box is a fun gamble with your life
Everyone has the urge to dig.
That’s a good place to Films a horror movie .you should try it. I bet it would come out scary especially with that smoke machine. I’m getting chills just thinking about it.
Colin - you should try to connect the shed tunnel to the bunker main atrium directly instead of the connecting hallway - just in case something goes wrong you have plenty of space to get to another exit.
My friends and I tried this underneath our primary school. Of course, after watching Colditz on TV. How far did we get? About 2 feet.
As a 4-9 year old, I’d go to my little 30 by 60 ft backyard and sometimes dig some holes as far as I could before it got tiring and no longer fun. The entire time, I’d fantasy what my underground hideout would look like. It used wood as walls and ceilings… and it was damp… even in my fantasy lol!
I’ve always wondered about how his neighbors deal with all the noise😅
At around @8:00 I got a little “put the lotion in the basket” vibe 🤣🤣🤣
It's 2023 and just wanna say R.I.P to David McCallum, who is the actor shown in the clip from the film The Great Escape.
You Good jop..👍👍🤣💪
did he say 6 inches when he's british?
The balls of steel
Shed to bunker please
1:48 to 2:30 is pure chaotic nutarel(nailed it)
挖洞还得用上“洛阳铲”
*The HSE would like to know your position*
I bet the whole silence/stealth thing comes from actual neighbour complaints from the bunker project and probably other ones. Colin's neighbours have the local council number on speed dial.
Brothers of the Mine rejoice! (Swing, swing, swing with me) Raise your pick and raise your voice! (Sing, sing, sing with me) Down and down into the deep,  Who knows what we'll find beneath. Diamonds, Rubies, Gold and more, Hidden in the Mountain store.  [...]  I am a Dwarf, and I'm digging a hole, Diggy, diggy hole, Diggy, diggy hole. I am a Dwarf, and I'm digging a hole, Diggy, diggy, hole, Digging a hole.
Wait if it's a SECRET tunnel than why would you make a video on it? Doesn't that defeat the purpose of it all? Cause it's a secret tunnel and now over thousands of people know about it
0:39 Oh those shinny new tubs. If they only knew what they were in for!
this does not look like a bad lockdown project to keep you sane
He is yousing the rong type of shovel
wait so where did that draft lead to?
Imagine living in Europe and caring if your noise bothers your neighbors🤣
One would think that with how deep he’s gotten it would suppress most if not all noise.
Be honest... how much did the trumpets help
I could not be digging and looking like hawk nelson at the same time
No one:   Collin casually putting a Kellogg's box full of dirt on the shelf while buying like three more:
Bros slide is upside down 😂
would it have made sense to make that wire mesh copper to make it like a  faraday cage
I'd be interested to know what he ***really*** did with the excavated material... or is that information too sensitive?
Is every one just gonna ignore the fact he left dirt in stores and cafes?
how many yards of material have you removed with the tunnel from shed to pantry part? i hope your utube is helping pay for all that steel and concrete - AMAZING
W0W!
dement proste
Dude ur so awesome I watched the 2hr version then I  watched all the shorts of the same content!  I'm a 45yr old man who's had ADHD for as long as I remember & u held my full attention!  That's not easy however u make it look so!
I just watched a man dig a hole, and I fucking loved it. man I wanna dig a hole now!
I used to fix JCBs for a living and we had loads of paddies working there in 'boots and suits' OMG could they shift some muck AND GUINESS!! Get a few of them over Colin......"ROIT MAYTE WE'LL HAVE DIS SHIFTED IN HOUR OR TWO HOW DEEP WOULD YOU BE WANTING SOR?" Good old boys arms like tree trunks HONEST AS THE DAY! They will shift 10 cubic metres an hour. Imagine living NEXT DOOR to Colin........ Sharon: "ere Dave hes in that shed with that mate of his again, wot you think they up to"🤔 Dave: "probably diggin an escape tunnel ROFL only kiddin love"🤣😂😆😅
Music's gotta go...but other then that. Great content
I love that this man's idea of stealth is A) the trombone, and B) inventing a new power tool

Don't you ever need a lumbar belt brace?
Dig to china: the 3rd dimension
I swear this is making me happier
“Why does this cereal taste like dirt?”
The sound dampening well talking at the end is great lol you could probably scream in there and no one would hear it because its not bouncing
He's like modern day Caractacus Potts.  Whata guy, zany or what!
What’s the movie scene he put in??
it puts the lotion on the skin
The UK government watching colinfurze build a tunnel under Parliament at the speed of light
5:02 - 7:34 Is there an actual name for this kind of tool, or did Colin just invent a new form of excavating equipment with this project?
Im surprised he didn't just make himself a belt conveyer type thing to automatically empty the full canisters xD
I just found your channel. You're an idiot. I love it!  EDIT: You've earned another subscriber today, lol.
If John Lydon could weld
😂😂😂
Just discovered the best channel EVER!!!!!
"It's not feasible for Bruce and Alfred to build the batcave, by themselves"  *Sends the link"

A motor with a spiral screw would have done the trick
It shows how powerful minecraft characters are

I was wondering why my box of coco pops was full of dirt.
The Great Escape!!! One of my favorites. Got it on DVD. This is awesome! 🤣🤣🤣🦍🦍🦍
this man is living more free than 99% of americans
what
WHAT ABOUT THE CRACK????!!!!!
Minecraft makes digging out a cubic meter of dirt look a lot easier than is actually is lol.
hey colin you dug into a archaeological strat, you can see it around 8:20
man, im so glad i live where i dont have to care what others think about how much noise i make, during the day, on my property.
this guy is the epitimy of cracks heads without crack and i love it
This is how I want to exercise by digging a big hole
Codys Lab should have been involved in this. Real life minecraft.
Literally every kids dreams right here lol This is what happens when you give engineers money
Crazy man
Bro you must just get interested in the sewing and moths and it will be a full package
it places the lotion in the basket kind of situation ahhahaha
Ilya Kuraykin - Nice Reference...
I wish I had this guy's metal budget 😉
That's incredible, 😀he can Thank God that he has his youth, good brain, Good health, good friends and some finances. Very fortunate.

Bro actually put an imposter box in the store
You could have put a spade on the end.
Greatful! Deep emotion!
Colin's trombone playing absolutely made my day 😂😂😂
Colin "Two Sheds" Furze
U are hilarious Colin
Lmfao 😂🤣😂🤣😂😂🤣😂🤣 i did not see that one coming brilliant tactics on getting rid of the dirt . But the dirt in the sock wasnt that in shaw shank redemption ?
That's why I got stones instead of my cocopops for breaky! Lol
Genius minds build fabulous things! ❤
Couple Mexicans and would’ve saved half the time of digging ngl
Mans playing mincraft
kid: "mom why is our cereal so crunchy?"
Kachawu
What's the song that starts at 6.24
All the knowledge it takes to even attempt this project and I learnt that there’s a difference between a spade and a shovel.
I know this is old and probably late but ehy didn't you get a 24" auger bit and drill out 4feet at a time? Then square it out?
There is some youtubers out there who sell the complete tutorial of how to install an OS on their patreon page, and here Colin making these amazing shows of his genius ideas, free to watch. Even germans have to pay for the shiiiiiiiiity TV  Programms they get even if they don't have any TV!
1:53 this is truly evil
The next person to get this house is going to be surprised
Still cool and I've been watching you for 13 years
Is it me or does he look like obi-Wan Kenobi Sometimes
I'm enjoying the project. The unnecessarily frantic music and unnecessarily frantic antics succeed in unnecessarily increasing the blood pressure of some watchers. I guess by now the die is cast, however.
I think we should officially call it "The Not So Secret Secret Tunnel". Has a nice ring to it. Either way, it's fun watching the journey of this take place,
Wait but for real where does the dirt go lol
Minecraft: Real Life
10 month birthday of digging my hole 🙈
Hope that draft isn’t a gas line
Mad as a box of frogs, but what an outstanding chap!
Imagine the people who move in next
Me: *hears a British person say inches* Me: You wot?
How did this guy actually do this rhing while doing other projects
Would be so cool to know two things... How many full days of work are spent digging so far, and how much money spent?
Is this legal
We've covered the great escape,, I'm still trying to remember the title of the next movie with musical instruments and then we have bits that could be from "Beneath Hill 60". All great stuff. 9:23 Dont worry bout it mate, tis only a gas main,,,, only kidding.
I was thinking, you're going to need a winch, and you paised to build one
i hope you dont turn deaf bro, pls wear good ear protection, not worth skimping on that lol
I love his unbridled passion for digging
Getting caught up haven’t watched sense the basement
Imagine being this guy’s neighbour
I just found you today. I look forward to watching. What could be more exciting than watching a guy dig a hole?! One Q, that I'll probably get an answer to along the line, but will still ask. How did you decide on the depth?
I wonder if would be a piece of cake to you, doing a SHOCKER SOFA, like the old electric chair arcade game... Sometimes I have some lack of energy  getting out of the couch.. I think that would do the trick!....
You know what I'm thinking?  I'm thinking, "Who wears a shirt and tie while digging a hole in the ground?"
Using regular carbon steel what is the estimate before rust becomes a concern?
Minecraft irl
Minecraft irl
How lucky to be able to dig with shovels.  I hit lots of rock within inches and require heavy equipment to dig.
This is the 3rd time I've watched this whole series.   I fucking love this shit.
Picking up and carrying buckets? ....I spent most of the video wondering why he didn't just use a wheelbarrow.
avrage australian
Jesus, Tom must have been dying, I hope that's not a rental. Dress wear isn't exactly the best at venting heat.
I’m not even a big saftey guy but the lack of shoring on the walls concerns me lol
this proves those villagers making fancy underground pools are full of shit doing it in a few days
do you know how to play trombone colin, as it seems like you mostly have a good idea of how to play
you're mental, and that's what makes this channel great
Where are those plastic tubs from?? They look wicked strong
Completely ludicrous and a danger to himself and others… and the best role model I have
The great escape
I am surprised he didn't invent a power tool for digging  oh wait he did!!!
I have questions about his neighbours
My only wish would be to change the music other than that perfect video
This guy is Bruce Wayne without the money
What a mad lad, he actually did it. We've all wanted to do this but he actually did it.
I do admire your metal fabrication skills and Engineering prowess. D
Iam so confused ar many points
Why not an augur?
Who is this not on discovery channel? It’s brilliant
As an adult I would hate to have him as a neighbour but as a kid I would've loved it.
How does one get a permit to dig a hole under the house and shed, and such?
This feel like every kids dream, and I guess many adults too 😅👌
Dude, what do you do for a living that you have so much free time? I also want.
Realise it's secret, but could not be bothered having to roll the carpet back every time...........
Glad you didn’t get buried alive.
SECRET TUNNEL! SECRET TUNNEL! THROUGH THE MOUNTAIN! SECRET SECRET SECRET SECRET TUNNEL!
This is something I've fantasized about in the past but was only just that, a fantasy. The fact that you actually did it is f*/%k*ng awesome, truly!!!
The Great Escape reference 🤩
It’s such a big tunnel secret only 5.5 million people know about it lol
this is such a banger of a video oh my gosh!!
I honestly expected you to make some kind of diesel powered atomatic excavator
Colin what did you study to learn all this?
I feel so sorry for your back.
imagian the faces in the people who move in if ferz moves out
i have to ask what would of happend if the crack did lead into a massive cave XD
I like the idea that he is doing things the hard way to keep this hidden then uploading it to the whole world to see.
Neighbors talking to each other over the fence, Colin has been mighty quiet lately, do you suppose he gave up on that tunnel ? 🤔
He makes stuff for himself, shares it with everybody else. In secret...
Are going towards the garage at some point?
What do you do with the dirt
So many safety violations o.o
Surely you had to get planning permission for this!? Amazing job.
I don’t get it why would a project like this be delayed because of the pandemic?
he made his own fucking power tool to keep it quiet
Should have made a CNC base above the hole and then the ram can loosen all the soil overnight, and in sessions during the day, then all you need to do is clear the mess at the end.
Where has all the soil gone?
I think you are turning the underground bunker into the batman said "the bat cave "
I'd imagine your neighbours are subscribed to your channel?
Go & see a shrink.
Secret underground tunnel that you upload the videos to YouTube 🤣😉
This dude is Minecraft Steve in real life
I think we can all be thankful this guy didn't go on ADHD meds.....  They were clearly needed.
i cant even build a tree house in my yard how did he get the pements to do this????
Bullnose shovel would have made the job alot easier
Nice content 🙏🏼💙💯
I wonder when he will hit bedrock
Minecraft...
stop the music time lapse
3:53 I want friends like Colin
Im amazed, truly.
hes a menace to society when he put dirt in the cereal and put it in the supermarket lmao 🤣
Harvey dent has gone too far
My man is playing real life Minecraft.
How do your neighbors feel about this
yo um your cocaine habit is showing
u didnt actually put the cereal box back into the store w dust right????
Have you or can post the plans for how you did this?
this dude is digging straight down, that's against the law
I love how he put minecraft in tags
If I were your neighbor, I'd be more worried if I didn't hear any ruckus coming from your lot.
If I tried this where I live I would be met with some serious gravelly soil for the first 3 feet.
imagine being his neighbour
What’s the name of the song at 10:50 I’ve heard it a few times but I can’t seem to find it anywhere
Everytime I come back to this channel I can't help but think of his neighbors.
😀
This would take but a few minutes to make in minecraft
I love how Colin builds the tools to build the project 👍🏻😎✏️🛠
I’m really wondering if he truly left containers off dirt everywhere. 🤣😂🤣😂
This is what would happen if I don’t take my adhd meds and I had access to power tools
Insanity never looked so good!
World: Lockdown Colin: I don’t need socialising, I need  H O L E
I love how instead of things getting more difficult he just sees it as exciting.
*builds secret tunnel* *Puts video of it on YT* *3mil ppl watch it* *surprised pikachu meme*
Let us know when you find Jimmy Hoffa
Ok yeah our town building inspector would send me to jail for sure for trying something like this because you know posting on YouTube would blow the secrecy of the whole thing
The random jungle people with sticks would have this done in a day
Neighbors definitely think he's a serial killer
What is the name of the movie with the sock? And dirt ?
Hey, you should have tried a large bore auger Mr Colin. It would even lift the soil up and out if you stuff that corkscrew in a tube type jobby! Noice ;))
I've been waiting for this video 📹♥️♥️♥️
Goes for a box of cereal gets box of dirt
A shock absorber to keep the door from falling and hurting someone would be good.
Just wondering weather Colin has a wife something makes me think not 😂
This all would have been very impressing if I hadn't seen a couple of Tahi fellas dig a palace out of the ground with a sharp spoon on a stick. 🤔😋
Thank you.
All fun and games until it rains
I love how deranged I was during lockdown, I can vividly remember getting UnIronically angry that Collin was just leaving piles of earth in supermarkets and restaurants. God! I am glad things are back to normal now
This is totally amazing.  Did you "need" council approval?  They would freak out if you tried to do this in Australia.
damn, I just played minecraft during lockdown!
It’s wild how wet and soft the ground is over there. Here in AZ this would take a lifetime without heavy machinery
The whole time he was down that hole with no wall bracing was giving me bad anxiety.               I’ve seen just a 4ft hole collapse onto a guys legs while digging a new sewer and it completely broke both his legs in several spots.          I heard of One guy that was completely buried by dirt during a dig and a dummy excavator operator decided to use his excavator machine to unbury him and completely beheaded the poor man.     Be safe and any hole over 4ft deep don’t go it it unless it’s braced.    It’s not worth your life.
Wanna calm the advertisements wow
Feel like a post hole digger or an auger would’ve been faster and better
Elchapo is hiring.
I am in love with your soundtrack!  So good!
The mileage from smart people doing dumb shit. Ima binge this channel
Poor neighboors... loud music, band practices, and some kinda concrete killing seesaw... but if they knew what he was building they would be ok with it (ofc)         ;)
Just the sheer amount of physical labor involved in just digging this thing is crazy not to mention stopping in between to build your own tools. I wish I had this strength and dedication
keep up the great work
colin furze is an avatar of the buried
Mannnnnnn I remember when you started building the original bunker i was amazed I’ve always wanted to do this but Yearssss later im scrolling through shorts on a different account and you randomly pop up digging a tunnel 😂 i wish i had u as a friend none of my friends really help with any of my crazy projects!
Collin doesn’t even have to worry about the noise he’s just giving himself more difficulty so he can think of ways to get around it..  true genius!
if no one believes they can do anything they put there mind to i just tell them to watch your videos
4:42 That's what she said.
When's your first concert
At 11:20, the metal frames appear to be curved. Are they really curved or is that the camera lens creating that effect?
This is great and you make it really comical
I got a sore back just watching this
It seems that the c lock down would have been the best time to work on the tunnel. Also, wouldn't the ground be a sufficient noise damper?
Fun fact. The shed is sound proof. So nobody hears the mad man.
Colin has invented the slow jackhammer
What happened with the draft? There's probably a river system down there!
How many complaints did he get to make him try so hard to be quiet
Why doesn’t Colin live out in the sticks where he can make as much noise as he likes and build bigger and better things? He must have the money!
So what happened to that “secret cave” from where the air was coming? ( at 9:02 )
1:22 darn skinny jeans.  Kids these days could never escape a prison camp.
My HOA would kill me xD
I dig a underground tunnel and bunker and people call me crazy but this guy does it and has millions of subscribers lol, only no one who doesn’t know already will never know where mine exists.
*drawn out inhale* SECRET TUNNEL!!!! SECRET TUNNEL...!!!! THROUGH THE MOUNTAINSSSS. SECRET TUNNELLLL
But where is all the dirt going?!?
I must say, when you started this I expected you to bust out an auger, just because they can be quiet and really effective at getting down into compacted earth. But your way is so much more fun!
lol
oh man i feel like lockdown would have been the perfect time to work on digging, what with not being able to go anywhere or do anything else. didn't think about the noise issue. what a considerate madman you are lol
Minecraft in real life
It was just a matter of time until he goes full Schizo
Love this video bro haha brilliant 🤩
I love how Colin does montages whenever he builds things.
This man took a year break to be considerate to his neighbors Jesus christ
I thinck if you,re so creative & Minecraft Game HELPS YOU to manifest ALL YOUR PRODIGIOUS CRATIVITY :D
Should have installed a evelator
1:51 Working in a grocery store, this doesn't seem that out of the ordinary.
Love this guy
Really though, where is all the landfill going?
My guy playin Minecraft
How tf do you keep your shirt so clean XD
He should try building an escape tunnel out of a prison cell
Never dig str8 down bro
Amazing stuff indeed.  (Oof no welding mask - https://youtu.be/0dYMRj9whp4?t=732.)
20 years from now this will be the premise of a horror movie One man one tonal all failures  Man dies in cave making a tunal
So why not have put in a stairwell?
Effing fair play. I used to work in  a cemetery digging graves and I tell thee what, digging big holes isn't an easy task. Especially if you aren't already fit! Edit-  oh,  cheating with hydraulics. Don't blame you!
Does make you think that, im an ex coal miner, so know how far those lift shafts go down, the engineering on those shafts must have been immense. Amazing really, not something you think about as you travel down in the cage for 10 minutes at speed..
If North Korea ever launches a nuclear missile, I know where to go.
Imagine a nuclear apocalypse or a zombie apocalypse this guy has a bunker and so many guns and things
This man really can build anything
Romans 8:37-39   No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. For I am sure that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers, nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.
if only digging it using spoon >_<
Malarky is right.
Not very secret is it if 5million people watching you made it
This guy…
This is the coolest
another idea is using a big plate as a blade and cut the dirt into blocks btw
Amazing 😻
Ow you are full of evil(sorry for my bad English, because I am from Russian 😈привет)
you know the build is crazy when he has to build his own tools
I've noticed that my Kelloggs coco puff serial is a bit more gritty than usual. I can't imagine why.
Unless you're sure you're sitting on top of old rubble I'd have checked that dirt for gold and copper in your area of the country.
I think my favorite part is when you took a sack of dirt to a bar and ditched him with the check!!!
I am in the United States and I can’t download this app
you are a nutter. LOL love it!
Your a mad genius of extreme caliber. Perfect 🤪🤣
2:15 "Stranges piles of earth appearing in Stamford"  Well, that's of course total nonsense. How would piles of earth just appear somewehere, all of the sudden. It's not like people would carry around bags full of dirt...
Capitol chuckles: i'm in danger
OK, He is wearing a tie when digging a tunnel. very decent.
This is a childhood dream!
This guys neighbours fucking hate him
These guys remind me of myself in Minecraft always making things underground
"Don't skip this part"    If its not Raid:shadow legends then i will watch the whole duration of sponsorship parts to spite adocalypse incarnate
your neighbors must fucking hate you lmao
Great escape for the win!
Your probably too far by now. Or maybe you though about it.   I would have digged just a bit deeper and leave a space to move in and do maintenance. (To avoid pest) use that new gap in the floor to drain water if it ever floods and install pumps to empty it out. This way it would look nice and not really have build ups and flood risks. For whatever reason.  It's small quality of life things. And compared to the whole order and investment. It's more work but rather just cheap add-ons.  If not a built under if would have been a slant in the floor or small irrigation to one side and pass in a grate in the wall. Where the pump is.
Band practice was soooooo fucking funny
You could hide so many bodies down there and it would never be found
The neightbor in all the youtube videos you see:
Only a Brit would wear a button-down shirt, tie and waistcoat while digging a hole in his shed
I'm pretty sure that is illegal
This guy's just living out every man's dream. What guy hasn't dreamed of making an underground bunker and secret tunnels at some point in their lives
this is some shawshank redemption level of digging
SECRET TUNNELLLLL SECRET TUNNELLL
That crack made me think of the old proverb from minecraft "Don't dig straight down".
Millions of people all over the world: knows exactly what he is doing His neighbors glancing thru the window: "I wonder what the heck is Colin doing this time..."
I know we're well past this point in the project but I'm surprised he's not using any kind of trench box...people die in holes like this every day.
Developing country workout plan. "Oh you know, I dug a large tunnel by hand"
Colin: Don't skip this bit!!!! Me: *Proceeds to skip immediately*
Наш самоделкин сам! один копал!!! посмотри!!! а так лайк!
Go terry the tunnel
I love this. Makes me laugh and educates at same time! I think I need to dig!
He should have just called survival builder to help him lol
I'm so glad to see that Colin is looking out for his neighborhood by trying to not be too loud
When I saw the pink wall I was about to ask what it was then of course psychic Colin tells me what it is 😂 never a dull moment on the Colin furze channel
Minecraft :)))
This would be impossible where I live, LOL. We have bedrock around 4ft down.
What I really want to know is where the heck that cave went
Hi Colin i was just Wondering if you could tell me what Kind of Filming Camera do you have
My “capitol is at risk”? Uh, seems like a really extreme investment if that’s the case. On the bright side my capital is completely safe so yay me!
Petition to call the wedge machine William the wedge
Its amazing how soft and wet is the english soil compared with the one i have to deal here un central chile
I know you have completed it now, but watching you working in a tunnel and not having any wall brace for the tunnel digging on the first 2 meters scared the crap out of me!
Why didnt bro go get a chipping hammer with a shovel attachment instead of building a hydraulic digging press 😂
neighbours  be like "wtf is tht lunatic up too now"
Obligatory "The Great Escape" reference.
I'm sorry but he did alot of unnecessary work just for this entry shaft like as someone who worked in an underground mine he could've made his life A LOT easier with an air excavator
Wait, "your capitOl is at risk", is that a dig (no pun intended) at the US getting the capitol stormed by fanatics?
Colin, why not use a posthole auger?  BTDT, works great.
How are you going to water proof it?, Won't your tunnel fill with water?
I love that he's actually being considerate to the neighbors with his madness :D
Colin: DONT SKIP THIS BIT!  Me: 👆👆👆👆👆👆👆
So THATS what Jimmy Neutron looks like as a grown up! 😆 Really tho, dude is a genius madman..awesome video!
its funny how that resturant says the dasnish invader... im danish.........       DUCKS... ASSEMBLE. BA,M BAAAAAAM BABAAAM BAAAM BAAAM BAAAAM
hope you do not live near a prison
Minecraft underground base haha
I’m calling health and safety, improper use of a safety tie
Crazy he did most of this on his own. Could probably employ some young lads  on a cheap wage to do a fair bit.
10k in equipment to dig 5ft hole. lol.
Tags minecraft tunnel 😂😂
the great escape : -)
Bro needs to hire the guys who build in the forest
Man Colin is so cheerful and great. Of all the random things to notice, when he had Tom over and they were doing "band practice". Was that a left handed trombone, and the slide was upside down? Have I not noticed he is a lefty before? Lol the oddest thing , the former band nerd of me made me notice
Anybody else fancy the idea of another Lincolnshire resident, Guy Martin, teaming up with Colin to develop some crazy invention for a death-defying speed challenge??!
this guy is the embodyment of "modern problems require modern solutions"
Funny vid
No gonna mention the dirt in the cereal box?
One question. Why is one of the tags Minecraft
Lol the great escape
He dug straight down😷 mine craft noob
He's living every men's dream god damn
Wieso hat er ein Ladezone Schild?:D 01:13

The "secretly getting rid of the dirt" part was very funny ngl 😂
Two lovers, forbidden from one another A war divides their people And a mountain divides them apart Built a path to be together  ...Yeah, and I forget the next couple of lines, but then it goes...  Secret tunnel! Secret tunnel! Through the mountain! Secret, secret, secret, secret tunnel! Yeah!
Minecraft real live action 🤣
My man is playing Minecraft IRL
I just feel sad for the five children who inevitably got dirt in their cereal
Mai
The next person to buy coco pops is gonna be in for a surprise
I wonder how you do this when you're not filthy rich.. 🤔
This guy just out here playing minecraft
Why did he not just build a laser to vaporize the dirt and rocks? He could make it.
I would have expected an hydraulic auger drill to speed up the dig.
oh your poor neighbours
ITS SO COOL
but
buddy im from america
Лайк от Garage 54
Should have built an electric auger or built an hydrologic auger off a skid steer
No one gonna talk about that box of dirt just on the shelf of a grocery store? I wonder what happened to it
https://youtu.be/tglIJiEMnro
Congratulations to everyone who comes in every single seconds
The fact that he does this in a normal town house is amazing
Respect 💪🦾
Awesome!!!
这位兄弟太有趣了，我必须要订阅你！and i love ur new torture machine！也许你应该联系地铁部门，让他们在你家设置一个站点。
I don't understand how you manage to make digging a big hole in the ground into a kick-a** project! You truly are amazing ^v^

SECRET TUNNEL SECRET TUNNEL
do you need a permit for this
👍👍응원합니다 👍👍🇰🇷
Hope Tom enjoys his Delorean!
Watching this makes me want to get back into engineering as a woman 😁
How exactly is it a secret tunnel if you're telling everyone about it?
That supermarket swap though 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
Properly burst out laughing at 1:35. Oo-er!
It's not a secret anymore!
0:55 ... That's SOME shit bucket alright 😂   ??? 😮 Denmark denmark oi oi oi!!! 🇩🇰😄
I dug a hidden room under my house in Vegas.  I used the same electric hoist to lift the many buckets of dirt . The electric hoist I found would over heat after repeated use. Hogan from hogan's heros would be proud!!
I really think Colin missed the chance to build a tbm.
can’t imagine what your neighbours think 😂😂love it
Nice job either way
Save yourself some time get something twice the size with wheels for the rubble or make a continuous life for the rubble to simply ride up use the lift to power it.
Where does he find this amazing punk for his background music? I could watch these just for the music, but the shenanigans are also glorious.
When he found the draft all I could think was 'don't dig straight down!'
I would have liked this more without the Monty Python antics.
This guy is one of my spirit animals
9:39 don’t you mean you’ve hit rock bottom?
Bought a house a couple months ago and had to put in a new water line.  At 14 inches we hit rock and clay.... Had to get to 18 inches deep to protect the water line (warm area so 18 is code) just barely hit it using a pick and heavy bar.  Trench was about 75 feet long and took 3 people 2 days to dig if that says anything.  Anyway, if you need to get rid of more soil send it my way.  Gotta backfill around the house so the water drains like it's supposed to and there is some of the yard that needs more added as well.  Then again I wouldn't mind an under garage bunker with a tunnel from the house.  Gotta build the garage with an apartment above it too.  I am sure I could get some soil to backfill then but I need a machine to dig it all out and a sponsor for the concrete and steel.
Bro you really deserve 10000000000 subscribers.love from India bro you are a genius and hardworking guy😇😇😇😇
who agrees that this video needs a serious 👍
El Chapo  peoples are spert in tunnel building 👷‍♂️ 😅💯🤘✌
https://youtu.be/WrWNK5nNors
did you ever learn in Minecraft don't dig down
9:30 i think u hit rock bottom...
12:50 he has finally hit bedrock
battery drill + auger bit would make less noise then anything used in that shed.
Wow
В армии копанир на 6 человек за два дня выкапывали, а он тут дырку в земле две серии уже роет..
@9:35 "Rock bottom..."
He’s quite enthusiastic!
Do you own your property all the way down to the center of earth? And what prevents you from going sideways at some point? It's free real estate!!
Furze.. man you have all the fun lol. Why didn't you build yourself a TBM? - We all know you've got the skills for it.. would be great to see a furze tunnelling machine in action!!!
Working your butt off, in a shirt and tie - hilarious! :-.) And the band rehearsal  - in suit as well, sooo funny!
Bro ur the type of guy who could make a real iron man suit, and I don’t mean Marvel, I’m sure there’s a guy paul something unable to breath alone for 50 odd years, use a exo skeleton + attachments like a ice man suit from Batman / astronaut mixed army exo skeleton, helping him move and being able to breath. Big feat but I’ve never seen  anyone do the shit you’ve done so, maybe u could give a guy even a few days out of that I bet he would be so great full !
How do you plan to do laundry and smell amazing down there?
4:05 like a mobster
So, the guy took minecraft too literal.
This guy wouldn't be kept in any prison for long, lol
Neighbour's wife to her husband: What are you looking at, dear? The neighbour, with binoculars next to the window: He's up to something. I KNOW IT. Meanwhile, Colin: 2:06
Should have used a efficiency 5 pickaxe smh no maxed beacon
I love how it’s a secret tunnel but millions of people know about it
You are needed if we had a chance to build electromagnetic 360 tesla compass to enter one of 3 else dimensions ,blue ,green and red and our light world
Huge difference with the audio quality there in the hole
Two lovers forbitten from one another A war divides their people And a mountain devides them apart Built a path to be together... I forgot the next couple lines but then it goes... SECRET TUNNEL SECRET TUNNEL THROUGH THE MOUNTAIN SECRET SECRET SECRET SECRET TUNNEL Yeah.

1:58 pure evil
find any fossils?
the next owners od this house are gonna be so confused   "honey, theres a tunnel in our shed!"
Creates a *secret* tunnel, and tells whole world about it on internet
Xdxdxsxdx
You sir, are a very clever, hard working young man. Having the personality, knowledge, skills, tools, and the financial access to build whatever your crazy brain thinks up, is just an amazing position to be in. What a treat and delight for us, to be able to watch all your mad projects that has brought you to this point. I commend you in your determination and consistence. Long may you enjoy thinking up and creating these innovative, unimaginable pieces of genius you continue to produce.
Never ask: A woman her age A man his salary  Colin furze how long it took him to make the tunnel  Colin furze’s shovel why it’s so small
this guy is a genius maniac, happy to subscribe in montana
Never binge watched so many videos from one Youtuber ever before. Thanks Colin!!!!! And take care Mate with all your crazy brilliant projects..
Well now I know why my cereal box had dirt...
I feel sorry for his neighbours
Meth is one hell of a drug...🥴
I feel bad for the person who bought the mud coco pops
# m i n e c r a f t
Olha só que música  show https://youtu.be/nK1wPoTw_OU
i think u could of just bought a small shovel 🤔 yr crazy!!!   and to invest, a pound of what? 👻
No free share yet via Freetrade....
This man is gonna get arrested.
I'm sure AvE would have things to say about that Hitachi jackhammer...
whats gonna happen to the house when you decide to move out?
You could never do this where I live.  Maybe you could...there would be huge water problem that would need to be mitigated with a pump--it would be a mudshow.   Radon and cave in would be issues here, too. Believe me, deeply contemplated this project, haha.

That's some hard digging,   clay stone mix.    Same in Southern Michigan.
You are my hero
Friend: so what'd you do during the pandemic? Colin: I dug a tunnel.
you should've just hired these indian guys to dig your tunnel
What's the music at 12:17? It doesn't seem to match anything on the description.
https://youtu.be/TdVltjkqEmo
Chaper 8000 we´re going to build ZION under my house!
Rock On Collin
Big hole straight down. Eh? Oxygen?
You have some of the nicest neighbors ever
He sits next to a poster above him saying strange piles of earth appearing in stamford 🤣
Someone start playing secret tunnel from atla
Absolutely love this, but have to assume there are construction and inspection people going into therapy after watching this.
"Minecraft is love, Minecraft is life" This man might have taken that too literally 😂
We never know this underground bunker could be useful
The end scene: respectful
Why not sound proof the shed? And besides I doubt anyone will hear you down there
A gas powered post hole digger would have broken up that soil super fast. https://www.harborfreight.com/gas-powered-earth-auger-56257.html
I think I'm in love! 😍
Sawn off tools this is getting serious
Come for the tunnel, stay for the musical taste
I hope you dont plan on moving in the next 10 years
Man imagine the people who buy his house next jeez they will have a plethora of surprises
Why do you have cookies in the sewing kit box
"Honey, the neighbour is digging again"
I'm surprised you didn't go for an arcing me deez screw type digging implement, instead of the slow motion jack hammer...
When i shortened my spade to put onto my Land Rover people pointed and laughed at my two inch long blade...
I'm new to the channel... Why does it have to be quiet? For the secrecy part?
That crack must likely harcore for the  gutters
Didnt even pay for the beer...
Ekhmmm...*auger*
Meanwhile, over at the neighbour's house:  "Honey, Colin's released a new video, looks like he's building a secret tunnel he doesn't want us to find out about." "Oh, okay dear, just keep an eye out and make sure he doesn't dig towards our secret underground lair."
Drops his jack hammer down the whole after he just put a winch above the whole 😂
I thought this would motivate me to dig out my basement. I think I am now unmotivated for all that work. Help!
I wonder if he needs permits to do this, because I’ve don’t stuff like this and we needed a permit
Is this done with council approval!?
I think a collab between Colin and Elon is in order. We could call it the underminers.   It would be boring as hell, but I'd definitely still watch it.
This man playing real life Minecraft
What does he do with all the spoil??
Legend says he did this to get rid of the hollow part in the entrance of the bunker
colin furze is like the fun uncle you had as a kid
What happened to the hydraulic pump that was don’t there before?
5:45 just realized Cult bars 😍
I’m having anxiety watching him do this without a helmet.
somewhere in colins neighborhood: -whats that hell of a noise coming from colins house? -he's making a new youtube video, but as long as he won't blow up the neighboorhood, i'm fine
You're crazy enough to be loveable. But stay on your side of the pond mate. ;)
british el chapo
Please tell me you aren't planning on leaving that moldy carpet in there the whole time..
This video is only for us people to see what you do with the tunnel not seeing you on the toilet or anything like that .
Imagine living next to doc, Brown.
Random brit guy: digs a tunnel secretly Also random brit guy: uploads it to the internet
Colins back toward the end of this will need an invention to help support it
Ah, yes the old "Andy Dufresne" method of disposing dirt.
any1 else thought that the trumpet thing at 4:14 sounded like the subways surfer song
9:46 looks like he hit rock bottom
It makes it better how he always wears a button up t shirt and tie
Incredible video Colin! Been watching since your very first videos--back when you were delivering beans on the go. Keep it up!
That's nuts... a draft there...follow that draft!!!
thats funny
How does your nabors hear a shovel.
Mad as a box of frogs,get in there.😂
I love these minecraft videos
Colin that’s a good point that bloke made. What happens if you sell the house?
so many times he must have thought, what am i doing... this is so much hard work... still does it, what a lad
i dont get why he couldn't make a noise
Etleast if u ever have a tornado prob u already have the solution 🤣🤣🌪
The reference to "The Great Escape was just genius". 😂
"Survival builder" is/are laughing their asses off, really.
sawn-off shovel
You could do with some wheelbarrows…
Well I sure wish I had your energy mate!
Incredible video!!!! I’m speechless , truly one of the best you tubers out there, amazing content!
I feel bad for whoever buys that box of dirt thinking it's cereal...
Wait how do you get...out of it?
For you guys so actually go and change clothes and get a trumpet for that sequence there Has to be some sort of beers involved that we're not seeing lol
The nice thing about being Colin he doesn't need to be sneaky due to the fact he makes so much noise all the time
Where did the air come from?
Remember kids: dont forget to vacuum your hair
now that is what I call Minecraft in real life
I don't know why they are doing it the hard way, by hand. Just invent a tunnel digging machine, and let it do all the work, probably in one day.  Would be easy!
2:22 you left your camera dude
Nice v..
you could've easily built a contraption that would automatically excavate the entire hole... and remove the dirt
I need him to help me build an underground bunker.
is this project old? it appears to have been completed for over a year. --> https://youtu.be/fqTDfpIpub4?t=36 (winch and screw in the mat)
This is why ADHD can be a gift rather than a curse.
Couldn't he fit a small digger in there ?
How deep is it?
Love the great escape references :D
Mate I bloody love you i wish i could do all this!
I wish any of my 3 neighbors doing construction atm would care the least bit about not making a horrible amount of noise... Kudos to that bro.
I wonder if he'll ever sell that house...
Worth between 3 and 200 pound?... That screams "you're gonna get 4 pounds and you're gonna like it"😂  in all seriousness I'm sure it's a decent app, but man that's a weird way to incentivize people to sign up
I wish my neighbours were as considerate as Colin. They don't even do any sort of DIY, they just exist... loudly
if you did it yourself, do you have bulging muscles now?
I "dig" this project!
It can't just be me that thought spades and shovels were the same thing?
Colin really didn't take well to lockdown did he...
This tunnel is for future colin's to survive during the nuclear fallout
Did you really just weld without the eye thing. Fckin mad man.
There must be so many mad ideas floating around in Colin's head? This is one of those epic ones.  I wonder what the next epic venture he will do? Bloody love watching these videos.
My local council want me to apply for permission to prune a tree in my back garden - god knows what sort of permission Colin had to get to do this...
Colin’s budget: Yes
Mans dug a fancy hole and I watched the entire thing with a smile
I remember the hydraulic pump in the shop video, it didnt make as much sense as to why you did that until this video haha.
10 years from now title - 'DIGGING THROUGH THE EARTHS MANTLE Part 437'
Rotary hammer with a spoon bit.  trust
Your back cries in agony when you open the shed door
So what did you really do with the earth you removed?
Please check out r/pettytheft I just made it!  Please post stories (and videos) of karens that tried to steal from you or someone you know!
Why didn't you just use a big skrew? Like a auger and place buckets at the top where the dirt would fall and just carry them away?
what is perfect is that the idiot digs while wearing a tie. which goes with his perfect idiot laugh.
Every young boy's dream to have a secret base lol
this is basically the least secret bunker ever (4,2 mill knows about it)
He was preparing for Covid even before it hit and he never knew it!
i love how minecraft’s a tag
It is not taht secret tho
Wife: where’s my husband   Him: digging for weeks straight
not very secret when you make a youtube video about it
this is actually the dream of every little boy with a shovel
What you didn't build a tunnel boring machine Colin.. Shame on you
Lol, @3:09 my mans juat discovered how/why the military developed the e-tool
What a madlad leaving dirt Inna Coco pops box in Tesco LOL
&TLDW: diggy diggy hole, diggy diggy hole
imagine goin in your shed and seeing your dad welding a shovel
Its like minecraft
Love it...Colin gotta get your solar run  l.e.d light food growing project growing down there in future
did you ever explore, e.g. by using a sewer camera, where that gap leads to?
Your idea is cool. Your music is awful.
Luck he is still alive with no proper support
Thinking of Avatar.... then screaming full blast... "SERCET TUNNEEEEEEEELL! SECRET TUNNNNEEEEEEELL!"
His neighbours must be having a fun time listening to the noise hes making
Anyone else thinking don't dig straight down lol
There's no way you actually left that coco pops box filled with dirt back in the shop
Did u skate?
Instead of customizing your shovel, which was probably fun, you could have gotten a military folding shovel. Just a thought
My capitol is at risk? Who’s attacking it?
Who else buying his house when he's gone
Fantastic! I really like your video. I enjoyed watching it until the end. subscribe Thank you for sharing my friend😄👍💕
What kind of permits do you have to pull in the UK in order to do something like this?!?
I love how he casually digs a hole in a dress shirt and tie
Is it secret cos its fun or are the neighbours complaining
Very trusting standing under the inexpensive plastic handled buckets full of 100lbs(?) of dirt and rock. You should make up something more substantial to carry that weight! Very intersting digging though. I'm waiting for you to run into some old medievel or stoneage era evidence; or possibly older?
I always vowed i would never subscribe to this lunacy, my bloody grandchildren watch this! Anyway i watched this and i'm afraid i have been hooked! On the face of it this is better entertainment than any of the garbage that is on conventional television, so i am signing up, by the way Colin, excellent video had me glued to the screen cant wait for the next instalment.
so this is the real purpose of the hydraulic bench pump
you were lucky, never dig straight down.
Not sure why the semi-formal clothing was necessary for the band practice deception. It's band practice, not a band performance.
But it's not a secret tunnel when you tell us...
2030: ALRIGHTY GUYS I JUST FINISHED THE CITY OF EMBER IN MY BACK GARDEN!
You will go down in history as one of the best to ever do it, Sir.
Imagine living in this house full of secret passageways and bunkers
Where is the scene at 1:25 originally from? It appears to be a movie I've never heard of.
Imagine if he could build his dream work shop with a proper amount of space.
Hogan’s Heroes would be proud.
A gas powered auger would've at least made breaking up the soil easier. It's funny. We're all just completely captivated by a guy digging a hole in the ground. Lol.
as I was watching the first part I was thinking what if he found a cave and made this super long tunnel system. I would also like to see what he would have done with the size of an American yard
first time watcher and subscriber. There's over 325million people in this country. How are they not watching this? INCREDIBLE!!
I hate the damn music on this channel, especially at 2x speed
I wish this guy picked a random subscriber like me to choose something to build for me 😩😩😩😩
Curious, do you need planning for an underground tunnel in your garden? Asking for a friend 🙈
Did he call the utilities company to check for underground power cables? If so, it's hardly a secret, is it?
The indian guys can do this in 1 day wih a stick
la casa de papel British version
I think this isn't his house but instead some kind of bank and he just makes us THINK it's his shop and house... Perfect cover-up :D
He’s preparing for a zombie apocalypse for fun
That smile when you see a man that has a Hydraulic Ram lifting heavy buckets.
You will need water pumps with a tunnel. Is it not simpler to make a big trench first?
You are crazy Colin, and I love it!
Imagine buying this house one day not realizing it has its own Secret bunker and just randomly finding it one day
Definition of not lazy
You obviously don't know that Roughneck actually make short spades for digging in tight holes. https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=roughneck+micro+shovel&crid=FJASFIO1WKDR&sprefix=roughneck+micro%2Caps%2C334&ref=nb_sb_ss_ts-doa-p_1_15
This man is the defination of work smart not hard.
5:25 Man, what the fuck?! 😄😄
I am kinda disappointed you didn't build your own small man sized tunnel boring machine to do all this XD
Your neighbours gotta love you😂💀
Imagine you buy some coco pops and you go to dig in only to find out that there is dirt in the packaging
What has amazed me is none of the handles of those plastic tubs have snapped, and broken limbs, or killed one of you.  You are a lucky bastard; buy a friggin' lotto ticket.   Also, you better put something stronger for cave-in protection going horizontal.   Well, if you didn't, you've survived, cause it's the future, and the news hasn't been about a crazy Brit YT'r dying in a self dug tunnel.  Aw, eff it. Buy a lotto ticket you lucky bastard.
Not to be a know-it -all, but there's this new contraption, been around, oh, 30, 40,000 years. It's called a wheel.  Some smart guy put a metal bin on one, and with two sticks across it for handles.   You know, it MAY work well for moving dirt, and rocks; merely speculating here, but it might be easier on your effing low back.
I was so happy to see you included a scene from The Great Escape, I kept thinking about Danny the tunnel king! Let's hope  some Nazis don't try and stop you!
Digging a tunnel is a mans dream. It doesnt even have to have a proper reason. You kinda just do it
I’d start digging…. Then say f%#& this…. Wish I had 1/10000000 his energy!!
This is a groundbreaking experiment
Have to say, that dirt made quite the great escape
Escaping COVID imprisonment, I assume.
Bit late now, but maybe a mini digger could've been used to do the initial digs? lol
9:35 We just hit rock bottom!! xD
I'm just here for the punk music.
Please wear ear protection, especially when jackhammering in a hole haha
This is dope.
This is why he put in the hydraulic system lol
I love everything this guy does not sure I'd want to live next door though
Question. Is this illegal? I imagine it is haha
Why i am getting money heist vibes??
Funny if your neighbours just watch your YouTube channel to see whats going on....
stop pumping shitty ads, dont you have enough from the YT rev yet?
You can hear when the year passes how much more exhausted he sounds and monotone. Lockdown super sucked.
Instead of the ladder you could you a counterbalanced metal "hot-air-balloon basket" lift with a sideways swing door and lower yourself down onto a bucket with a chain drive on a loop. Forward to the house then just reverse gear to go back to shaft or cave. so cool!
It puts the lotion on its skin......
Humanity needs more people like him.
This guy is doing crazy moment
i absolutely love the music in the background of this series of videos
Can you imagine the people who buys his house after he moves with all his YouTube money.  Going to be in for a real shock I tell you what.
Where your real bunker
He doesn't want to make a noise so makes something that doesn't using a angle grinder
Probably add some straightening straps to the carpet so it rolls back out when you close the trap door.
I love how this guy isnt a youtuber that "does the work" but really doesn't... He really gets down and dirty and instead of blowing his money on hiring it out, he uses his money to build it the best way possible and gets to work!
i think getting an auger would have been faster than making a new tool
Younger you when you played Minecraft: I’m going to make a bunker that no one will know about
When the teacher asks the kids “What do you want to do when you leave school?” I wonder what Colin said?
If I were you, I would have made a conveyor belt to a container outside. And you could have gone to an army dump to get one (or two) of those short shovels.
When you say "Your capitol is at risk" are you aware of another uprising against the government? Is that why you are building a secret bunker? 😆
6:08 thats what she said
1:24 LOVE! AND SUSCRIBED! lol
I just love how he builds his own tools 🔧 u don't need a DIY shop when u got colin furze  awsome 👌👍👍
Is that crack in the slab starting at the corner of the hole a concern?
As a prior U.S. Army Aviation Logistics Aviation School UH-60 Blackhawk Repair and Crew chief, I'm loving this, bloody brilliant mate.
if rick from rick and morty was real
This episode is just suffering from lack of explosives :)
Please protect your ears colin
Hey, meld plate or metal sheet is a waterproof?
Do you need permits for this kind of thing?
Need to break through that limestone barrier? Use a steam drill to make several (4 or 5) holes approximately 1.5" to 2" in diameter and roughly a foot deep then...4 or 5 sticks of dynamite and a little distance.
Dont dig straight down
*Happy Vietcong Noises*
There was a jackhammer called a "Gentle Jack" that was supposedly vibration-less. The inventor died and I have not heard anything more about it. There is a YouTube video about it though. Seems great for this project.......(except it seems pretty shady)
You should check out ask Jeff Williams he's got a tunnel that you dream about
I would’ve used that jackhammer with me a spade to dig that hole works great I have a Lotta holes in the south west United States dry almost like concrete
@Collinfurze did you ever play Minecraft..?? >>you never dig straight down you dingle berry.<<   LOL great stuff been watching for years since the early builds.
this is so pointless and you actually risk your body big times. looking forward for your genius-ideas .
Press f to pay respects to the kid who got a cereal box full of dirt…
The distinct roadway hooghly shrug because brazil previously type forenenst a volatile gazelle. glistening glorious, evanescent index
that is a qiet jack hamer
We are wondering what are you going to do with all the dirt.   Because digging a tunnel,  creates a tremendous amount of dirt, rock, etc.
You betcha we subscribed to this channel!!   (We=my wife and I)

you gotta love how considerate of the neighbours colin is lol
Ive just looked at the video views, And realised 45% of you that watched this Part 2, never actually seen the Part 1 of this series, Interesting, well, go and watch it haha.
Colin is like that one kid who actually follows through with his crazy ideas
Never dig straight down
Пол уже дал трещену. А земля просто ужас. Там хоть плодородный чернозем хоть бывает?
2:07 as a Dane, i am not sure how to feel about this. Honored?
Two lovers, forbidden from one another  A war divides their people And a mountain divides them apart  Built a path to be together ...Yeah, and I forget the next couple of lines, but then it goes... Secret tunnel! Secret tunnel! Through the mountain!  Secret, secret, secret, secret tunnel!"  Two lovers, forbidden from one another  A war divides their people And a mountain divides them apart  Built a path to be together And die... Secret tunnel! Secret tunnel! Through the mountain! Secret, secret, secret, secret tunnel!"
You are a lunatic, you should be on the tele, this is brilliant!
4:55 Your "capitol" is at risk? Is this a hint at the current geo-political situation in the US or are you like me who purposefully disables all spelling checks just to mess with people & all those grammar cranks?
I wish I had one of those hydronic digs when I was digging and filling those 9 skips of soil from the back garden 😂
Whatever happened with the crack that connected to outside
Why does he has a "ladezone" sign in his shed????
1:56 xD
Out of interest, did you need to get planning permission to do any of this?
Can you imagine the estate agent listing when he eventually sells his house.
Tom was on wheeler dealers wasn't he?
What happened about the crack Colin?
Are we there yet? 😂
Brick
Was that fella helping Colin in that program where he got a delorean?
2:30 i think you need a rail cart😁
Your method of disposing of waste had me in fits of laughter.
If Minecraft has taught me anything, it’s never dig straight down
I haven't seen all episodes of this project yet, but... Is there a moment where you go down the tunnel hanging on the hoist mimicking famous "Terminator-2" episode? :)
So now we ha e to watch ad breaks in the video, and listen to 3 minute ads in the videos….
i wish we were friends
What an awesome project. On another note, I just watched Silence Of The Lambs the other night...
What happened to the HYD pump that was built in before? Or was it not strong enough? I swear you had one already for you press and testing new toys.
That cereal trick bro he is a menace to society
Watching people digging in England just depresses me. It's just... boom, I've got a shovel, let's go down ten feet. Here in BC, you need a mattock just to get down more than an inch, and you hit bedrock after about a foot.
Imagine if that crack turned out to be a tunnel under your house that one of your neighbours had started digging?
@Colinfurze : You should show the Laguina Brothers on Oak Island how to dig a hole, they have been spending millions in over 6 years or so to reach the so called money pit :)
Brilliant just absolutely brilliant 👍👍👍
I live on granite plate rock. No chance.
It's weird you even have neighbors. Why didn't you get a house on some land a long time ago before making all these bad ass improvements?
Sure dat is a lot a work for one man now.
If you're gonna buy stocks BUY AMC! The squeeze is REAL!
DIGGING A SECRET TUNNEL Part 4: Turns out the crack was a pocket of unmined natural gas
Rewatching because I want ep4
Never dig straight down
you need  to secure the walls . otherwise its too dangerous at it will callopse ower time.  plus there will be lots of water ower time :P
Tom is a damned fool. Everybody knows that the first rule of secret tunnels is that the owner has to kill anyone who knows about the secret tunnel!
I don't understand why you had to stop digging on your own property, because of covid lockdown??
Always have a secondary or third escape exit in case of collapse
Forgot to tell ya when ya bought the house itd in an earthquake zone
You can just buy mini shovels, Roughneck do a micro shovel
I’m sure nobody has a CLUE what’s going on. Excellent concealment techniques, Colin
Cant tell what's more insane, this project or him digging in a white shirt.
if this guy makes a jet engine hoover i will, well idk what i will do, pls make one ;)
No update on the crack?
[4:01] You even confused the subtitles!
Colin. Can it be that youre seeing something we dont see?
If that cut down spade breaks Collins needs to return it to the store
secret tunneeeeellllll- chong the nomad
Stay safe dude that’s dangerous
This secret has a small amount of 4 million people who know about it
whats the name of the background music in the lockdown scene at the end?
love how you tagged this #minecraft
This is like every kids dream
The new Rick from Rick and morty
LOL! As if your neighbors would choose *this* particular project to care about!?!
11:40 September 2019.......the poor bastard doesn't know whats coming...
Omg he did #minecraft
This dude is going to be a millionaire if he sold this house
Wishes do come true.
nice bulid i hope you find a big caves to make your bat cave !  and save time diging
It's not capitol, it's capital.
Back in the 70’s had a neighbor that dug a tunnel, from his basement to a two and a half car detached garage. He used a posthole auger to loosen the soil. The Tunnel was put together with bolt together corrugated curved pipe sections. He alway had free fill dirt available. County, tried to cite him and force him to remove the tunnel after he was finished, and they discovered it. There was no ordinance against what he did, LOL.
Next project batcave?
You’re such a respectful neighbour! Stops an entire project just so you won’t bother them with noise!oolong awesome, one insane project
Those little dudes in the woods would have had this done in like 2 days
amazing. simply amazing. ever. amazing.
You're are so mad! Bud I like it!
The motivation is awsome man
This man has been able to create an entire bunker under his backyard, yet we can't even do that
Love the sound deadening down there
Now That's....That's sex to my eyes!
If you cut the shovel at an angle, the butt weld has more strenght and you dont need a collar.
Can I state the obvious?       It's not a secret tunnel if you're posting vidoes about it on Youtube!
Buy yourself a roughneck micro shovel! Or get online and buy an old army 58 pattern pick and/or shovel!!
Shame this channel chucks in stupid cringe crap instead of sticking to the building.
dig it with electric auger lol
Im so jealus, i Want to do an underground bunker to expand my house! Tho a bit late, wouldnt an earth drill work to soften the soil? I Know thers some powerd by motors but Colin could do it with hydrolics i think  Like a bore with like 25-40 cm in diameter
Wow, Colin Furz actually milked a video for money.
I still wonder how his neighbors haven't moved out yet
I was digging up a sewer line years ago and I turned to the guy watching me and said, "you know, there's a lot of dirt in the ground."
Could you build your own rail gun for are type 45 destroyers as it the future for the weapons system on the UK ships because BAE Systems can't get it to work because it over heats within just 2 or 3 shots.
so the tunnel was the reason you needed that hydraulic system for your shop XD
Isn't it 'capital', not 'capitol'? 🤨
Who else is wondering how ripped he must be to do this!!!
Reminds me of the move the great escape
#no
This man has to be on some FBI watchlist somewhere  FBI HQ: What's he doing?  FBI Agent: I think he is digging a hole with a... trumpet?  FBI HQ: that seems to... Normal keep watching him...
Is it me or was Tom starting to play when the saints go marching in on that trumpet
A reference to one of the best movies ever made BRILLIANT
Colin, that crack is the London sewer system.
What about a home made hydraulic  tunnel boring machine ?
I liked the great escape touch lol 😆
Don't dig straight down Colin you are going to fall into lava and creepers! :p
this is what ive been doing in my minecraft kingdom. A man's dream
What a dirt bag😂😂
*Hits an electrical cable or utilities*
ia it rilley secret
Looks like a nice area to get quiet and maybe bring a switch lol.
whoops we hit a uranium deposit (Geiger counter clicking intensifies)
Did we ever find out what the cave was connected to?
so great
I'm so glad I just found this dude. He is fucking nuts wtf  This is awesome
I am never gonna start investing.... it's too shady
Every mans dream
What kinda permits or papers do you need to do this?
Put a smoke Bomb in the crack and try to see where the smoke rises on the surface
You are an absolute hero man!
Can't believe there are no 8-decade old bombs or rockets down there

Not so secret with millions views
The music SUCKS Mate!
first time ive watched a sponsored section all the way through on youtube, had a good laugh at the biscuit tin
I want a bank heist movie where an inventor like Colin digs a tunnel
i love the ads :D
It really says #minecraft
6:08 thats what she said
10:23 friend, where is your hearing protection? You're an example, young man
I ask again is this legal
Of course colin has a Henry
i wonder how much his house is gonna eventually sell for
Love the 💡idea
1:01 BEE BOY,        comment if you get the reference
Think the Mexicans might ask him  to help out with a project they have getting certain products into The USA🤣🤣🤣🤣
I cannot wait to see this finished
what the neighbours upstairs do
Hell yeah dude, see you next year!
I would have used my petrol hole auger for the First bit of digging😜.  I wouldn't have welded those hinges on straight away.
after seeing his head in the cookie tin i got scared when it cut to him on the toilet
just saying im here... epic
This hole thing is just an exercise in hearing loss
Bien
2:16 you run out of a shop and leave your bag behind in the U.S. thats a good way to get arrested and people to think its a bomb lol
ты крут, чувак)
Dont mine straight down lol
Secret tunnel secret tunnel through the backyard
the Minecraft 1x1 Dirthole IRL!
this guy is completely Nuts! and i love it!
Absolutely nucking futz!
Do you need planning permission for this? Lol. In Cornwall we have tunnels preinstalled.. unfortunately sometimes they eat your patio.
I'd have used an augur, like for digging post holes. Would have been much quicker than the hydraulic ram thingy.
What's the music at 12:16? Doesn't appear to be listed
When you dig straight down and find a cave.
NEVER dig straight down m8
the great escape reference made my day man
I thought it would be fun, but now I’m realising how hard it must be on your back.
Minecraft in real life
This is crazy goody, how have I not seen your channel before?
Buy a bigger house? No, start digging bunkers and tunnels :D
What happend to the air flow hole? Show more where it is now?
Imagine your dad was a crazy inventor and he dies in a tragic car accident then for you to realise 5 years later he has been living in a bunker and travelling through tunnels
That Guinness he was served at The Danish Invader looks disgusting!  🤢
Didn’t you build the hydraulic attachments a while ago
someone dug with white shoes lol
I don't know about the UK, but in Canada, that dept of digging demands wall braces to prevent cave ins. I know there is a part 3 so I reassured but Colin, be safe! (I meant the braces came up a bit late...)
Incredible. I have no other word.
Colin is one Lightning Bolt away from becoming a super villain :D
Coolest projects
Never dig straight down
Get through that Stammy clay boi
colin should have kept the dirt and make wall of death 2
I'm digging it
What was the name of the movie clip about filling the bags I have been trying to find that movie for years and I cannot find the name of it for the life of me
Fuck me colin that looks like hard work, I suppose you could always use it as a grave when you die of exhaustion 😂👍
Next video: adding a room in my hole to China part 1    5 years later: halfway there can’t get out but still going                                                                  Still going                 Oooh found a cool diamond                                                                                      Years, years, years, years, years later finally made it but king John un won’t let me back to England
What all your neighbours went away on the same day, lol?
I forgot how entertaining this is
What's the name of the music that begins 12:15?
Real life vents lol
Litterally the most enjoyable yt channel i have ever come across period....
Damn, they really are profesionals digger.  They use suit 😂😂
Legend! I want to watch this all day! And I want to listen to the song at 12:17 all day too! What is it called? Doesn't appear to be one from the 5 tracks in the description...
Should have invited our Crew at Vascoseg.com to do this, we are pros lol. Anytime you are in Southern California we need a digger lol.
Digs secret tunnel, then proceeds to tell the world about it.
men. if you have any women doubt you when you say men can have fun with just simply digging holes, send them this.
I would love to know how Colin explained this to the local council 😂
Minecraft irl be like:
#minecraft? umm okay makes sense.. i guess
I love how he put minecraft as a tag
SECRET TUNNNNNNEL   SECRET TUNNNNNNEL
Dude get a spade shovel
could the air coming from the ground be a ruptured/broken natural gas line? I'm not sure about the UK, but here in Australia, we get our gas in pipes from the government that travel underground, similar to sewage and water.
9:34  Him: I think now we've actually hit... Me: Please say "rock bottom" Him: ...Limestone Me: ...seriously?? It was right there!
I love those video, it’s straight to the point and no 20 minute bullshit before
If you ever move out of this house, I’ll be extremely upset :(
You're know how is crazy mate keep it up
SECRET TUNNEL! SECRET TUNNEL! THROUGH THE GARDEN! SECRET, SECRET, SECRET, SECRET TUNNEL!!
I am a fans from Vietnam, may I connect my tunnel with yours?
Insane amount of commitment
Cool sponser
Tom is one hell of a friend
One day you will hit a water pipe and tons of waste will splash in your face.
Don’t tell the next person you sell your house too. Hide a camera in there plugged in constantly (get a low powered one so they don’t get suspicious). Then just wait until they find out.
You should never dig down.
Your neighbours must love you!
i wonder how you can safe kid inside of you through so much years)) now I only 26, but if I will start digging secret tunnel in my backyard my parents will kill me (but its my kid dream to make SECRET TUNNEL!) MAN PLEASE DO NOT GROW UP!!!!!!!!!!!)))))))))))))
I love how he makes all these wacky machines, but he’s considerate of his neighbors
If you ever sell the house don’t tell the person about the bunker and just let them discover it.
Mans mad in the best way possible
Yawa
Good
Minecraft, with a tweak of reality!!!
You should keep the mesh. It’s an awesome dystopian visual effect.
That crack is legit amazing!
I bet everyone on your block knew what was going on.
Furze has really dug himself into a hole in these recent vids
This must be great exercise.
Is there any age restrictions on the free trade app cause I’m seventeen
muckman
Mining diamond irl
You should have engineered a Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM), like the ones used to build the Chunnel.  Just scale it down a little bit.  If anyone can do it, you can.
I never thought a series of videos about a guy digging a tunnel would be so interesting to watch.
Dammm
Proving to the world that ADHD a gift.
Minecraft 😈👍🏾
Waiting for Colin to strike oil
Limestone isn’t hard Colin
Thank you Colin. I've been waiting for this!
I am so jelly.
Its so amazing that i am watching part 2 after part 3 👍😁 amazing videos man keeo creating ❤️
In which we find the remains of Richard III. Who knew there was another one…
For being a year into it and still so excited. That's commendable! Love this project though
so he never really says what he does with the dirt? i watched ep 3 then ep 1, then this just to find out where he put all the dirt. slightly disappointed. still a good video.
It was at dis moment when I realised… why Minecraft day is 10 min long
"WHERE'S YOUR JET ENGINE!?" had me laughing in tears. He just sounds so genuinely mortified, like a parent that sees their toddler walk into the family room without pants while company is over.
Omg please don't ever change lol you make me proud to be British lol
New laws imposed state that local councils MUST ask colin for planning permission before any future contrstuction
The bunker was one thing, but this is just a full on bat cave
Can't you hire one of them massive hoover machines they can excavate with?
12:16 song name?
7:27 lmao
It’s all fun until u realize u are binge watching a British business-looking maniac with weapons and a zombie preparation system.
Colin, when you’re ready to sell the house, let me know.
My mans just built a “secret” tunnel with over 3 million people watching him doing it.
Good on you Tom. Only the best of mates helps to dig a secret tunnel.
That crack terrifies me. How much more empty space is beneath us? I have a phobia about that
"Wow Colin mate, youre looking really fit and healthy at the moment! How have you gotten so ripped with all the gyms closed in lockdown? Its almost like youve got a secret gym or something?" "errrmmmm......"
Amazing work! So so cool 😎
I've never seen anyone make so many custom tools for a project.
He’s breaking the number one rule never dig straight down
If I had on my side someone with the genius of Colin and my same ambitions we would be shaking the world at the moment
Imagine the legal issues if he did this in America
Imagine trying to sell this house
A post hole digger would of really helped.
Absolutely MENTAL!! Absolutely AWESOME!!
This whole time I was thinking about those prison break stories where they dug tunnels by spoons and stuff.
no automatic language translation
Question: why did he order full sized shovels and cut them down instead of just buying shorter shovels? Answer: because it was a damn good excuse to break out the welding torch and that's quite fun
Here I was thinking he was going really hard with the 'secret' part of the tunnel for a gag, but no, he's just trying to be a considerate neighbor.
Sooooo much work 😧
5:49 How did you even get on the bike
3:11 Ah yes now you have ye own kiddie shovel
The secret tunnel that 3.8M people know about 😂
hey m8 you have a loicense for that secret tunnel ?
Free trade ain’t available in US
But where did the draft come from?
a prime example of what productive people do during quarantine
Ahhh, nothing like the sweaty dirty diggy work of manually digging *huge* holes in the yard!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiAZSnISC5Y
when you have nothing to do for covid this happens
Colin: Dies  God: "How did you die when you were wearing your safety tie?"  Colin: "Meh I found a way"
Every kid has had that impulse just to dig a big hole in their yard. This is the culmination of that impulse
Shane Wighton (from stuff made here) and Colin in the same workshop. Omg 😱 😂😅
That would be a great place to store a dead body:)
Well its not secret if u make a video about it
Great stuf agan dude greetings from the Netherlands 💪
This head in cookies reminds me of Weirds Als head in potato’s in his music video “Dare to be stupid”. 5:32
Wouldn’t one of the screws from your tank build work to get dirt out, like a massive drill?
4:17 hört sich sehr nach Thunderstruck an 😂  Grüße aus Germany
The machines can analyze the isotope composition of those dirt piles and pinpoint your location down to a few inches.
2:32 what song is this?
Safty ties all arround then. Very good chaps. Carry on.
THE DRAFT IS LIKELY GAS MATE.. RADON
You sneaky devil you. You dug that tunnel AND produced regular content. I love the tie in between when you added hydraulics to the shop and using them.here
You have a rocky yard
3,774,799 people know Colin is digging a secret tunnel, don't tell anyone.
I hope he is making good money on this videos,  thats hard work right there
always predrill the shaft !
You should build a bookshelf for the entrance in your house
Previously on prison break
"Neighbours are away today, so I'm gonna take the opportunity..." [crosses fingers he'll say "high explosive", say "high explosive", say "high explosive"!]  Ah well, we'll see about this breaker thing. Incidentally the bit where Colin installs the lifting winch was right about the second it hit me he should use a lifting winch, so he's got this editing thing spot-on! Sort of thing occurs to you after you've already broken your back lifting a few tonnes already, but then you get to do a lot of thinking when you're down in a hole being repetitive. Some stuff only occurs to you at the time, and no sooner.
Adhd hahaha insane superpower
I'm disappointed you didn't know the Jonny Briggs theme tune. It's the only thing pops into my head when I see a trombone.   Incidentally I looked it up! "The Acrobat" composed by J A Greenwood in 1936! There y'go! You can make loads of stereotypical Yorkshire jokes about being "down t'pit" all day as well! Remember his dog was called Razzle!? The second-most famous use of that name.   Wouldn't it be worthwhile implementing some sort of conveyor belt scheme? Would actually save time, I bet, and be a better use of your energy than lugging buckets of muck around. I also once saw some sort of one-wheeled cart mechanism used to convey dirt and stone around, apparently a professional builders' tool. It's propelled by means of two handles sticking out the back. It might compare well to lugging buckets on a sack barrow. If you can purchase such a mechanism, possibly jet-propelled or otherwise based on obscure Nazi technology, all the better, but Argos probably do them too.   But seriously I reckon a conveyor would be worth the effort in saved work. Not running all the way to the supermarket, do that bit in a van. Or just dig a hole to put the dirt in, and bury it.   A big pile of muck and rocks will surely present itself to some useful scheme. Must be loads of things you could build, even if it's a hill to be king of. You could use the rocks as hardcore. Unlike Jonny Briggs's dog.
I wonder if Colin fancies streaming the dig? Just have a camera on while he's digging, doesn't have to present to it the whole time. Just watch him sweat and probably swear a bit. Incidentally for a rocket-bike pilot it's admirable how well he gets swearing under control. Pledge a dollar every time he needs to pull his pants up to cover his bum crack.
Secret Tunnels - Pros: Covers floor with lino, hiding entrance from casual observer. Cons: Documents entire thing on Youtube.  Hmmm. Maybe security needs reviewing.
Think about this, the underground beach hut was just a test mule for the real thing. Then, Colin has been digging this tunnel for three years, and still building other projects and putting out videos without any of us knowing.
The neighbours in reality: Colins not made any noise in his shed all week, do you think he's alright? Theres normally power tools 24/7
Magnificent  effort.
nice ladezone schild 😂
yeah, secret, post it on YouTube that will make it more secret YES! :DDD  so cool tho!
The hydraulic  "clay kicker".
Why didnt you just soundproof the hole?
so thats why he made that hydrolic bench
Just imagining Health & Safety, having kittens watching this.
I have a serious question i have watched you videoes for years but what the hell do u not have neighbours or something???
See you borrowed the misses her hitachi I see lol
Colin's Minecraft playthrough part 2
no
you should livestream the tunnel digging
Best project ever! If you come up in the neighbours living room, I’ll lose it 😂
wheres the next vid it should be uploaded????
I want to be like you 🥴
Hey @colinfurze I’ve been working on a drift trike build and I can’t thank you enough for what you did to help everyone to build a drift trike. I was just wondering what did the frame look like without anything on it, or do you have a blueprint?
Ahh waiting for part 3
You straight up doing it prison escape style
It's not a secret when 3.7m people know it
I love this crazy man, he is the same crazy as myself, just smarter...
Madddd
why didn't you use a powered auger , you git !? Love your channel.
Literally everything Colin builds gives him an advantage in an apocalyptic world
its not really secret anymore is it Colin?
Colin is literally doing the things many people wanted to do as a kid, but realised it's actually very hard to do.. yet he still does it. and puts so much effort and work into it.   some of the best content in youtube, easily
Poor nabores
love it , instant sub
Cant wait for the next part :(
11:40 care to explain?
Should of made a tunnel borring machine then you could of gone anywhere 😉
i like how he could be as loud as he likes but yet he still chooses to try to be "stealth" which does add interesting story and the ideas he used worked quite well
At first I thought this guy is crazy but not this crazy
This man is going to rebuild the I.S.S in his backyard.
Think for the future! You should make some improvements on that hatch door, like adding big ass springs to assist in lifting that door up, so that you could use it when you reach senior years...
Anyone see the titles of these videos and just....  🎵SECRET TUNNEL! SECRET TUNNEL~🎵
hay colin you should set up a discord
I thought you would design some sort of digging machine that digs cylindrical tunnel downward.
That mesh would be effective to prevent chickens from escaping, but not your head from collapsing soil, which weights allot more. I'd use thicker mesh gauge, if I were you.
I remember when you made your bunker
Title: Digging a Not secret tunnel
Love this!!!!!
This guy never heard of a wheelbarrow
Colin after the first hour of digging: 🤬 I’m committed now!
I just love when stuff just works
You lucky bastard. My water table varies seasonally between 1m and 2.5m below grade.
12:11 welding with no mask, that's the style
I'm calling a mole machine
Imagine that the next owner of his property finds all of this
Council planning permission are definitely on your pay roll..
Neighbours will be suspicious if you wasn't making noise.
Wonder how many time he broke or pass out while doing this...
"secret"
So how far are you away from the bank?
And then the moment that you remember he put out a video on the hydraulic system in Feb 2019...  This man has been at it for a long while.
Well it's not very secret if you are telling 11 million about it is it? Hahaha
make iron mans jet pack
Hope you realize how absolutely genius this video is
Imagine cleaning out the shed years into the future and finding a trap door that leads to a tunnel that leads to a bunker you didn’t even know was there…….!!! Love This!
My mans just built a “secret” tunnel with over 3 million people watching him doing it.
I love it man, you made me laugh for the first time today.... bad day Not all super heroes wear capes!! And surprised you didn't make a conveyor to move the dirt
Thanks Colin for my free share, just got it from FreeTrade
Please I need to watching part 3 quickly 😢😢😢
Didn't you talk about putting a toilet in the bunker at one point? Might be an opportune moment.
Me: what will Colinfurze build next? Colinfurze: SECRET TUNNEL! SECRET TUNNEL!
SECRET TUNNEEEEEEEL
Thank you for reminding me how great of a movie The Great Escape is.
Seems like an auger would make this easier
Ou
Part 3 please!! It’s been a week!!!
It. Looks like a mine
If your neighbors ever Google you, you’re busted. I’d wager them not seeing you up to something would have them more considered!
not a secret anymore
its amazing what one crazy British man can do 😅
Can you make a mini old land rover with on simple tools pls
As someone who does groundwork for a living, his arms and back will be killing him. Fair play to you
It's all fun and games until an actual apocalypse comes and this guy is the only one with a secret bunker
Love the Mad Scientist content that you are producing! Keep it up. Just loving the secret bunker access project.
real MVP = his wife lol.
SECRET TUNNNNEL SECRET TUNNNNNEL
I feel like someone is gonna buy this house, he will leave these things here and the new house owners are gonna think hes a massive drug dealer or something
I dig it.
I'm really digging this whole Minecraft IRL thing.
Saddam Hussein 🗿
could you just vacuum it out?
Why do I want to see you build something with the guys from BOM😁🤘
Trash dig it all the way to store and house trebulee dig in to houes
Is that construction legal in your country?
Colin hear me out, ride on mower, quadbike transition? make it fast lose the deck etc maybe some extra demolition aspects as well......... apocalyptic ride on??????????
Trying to figure out how the backyard swing plays into this build? I know Colin has a plan.
Your an absolute nutter, but in the best possible ways. And I love it.  Didn’t know why you were showing in subscription feed, apparently I got unsubbed at some point.   Subbed again though!
Was only two days ago I watched the great escape hahaha
"On next weeks episode I build a bunker under my neighbors house without them knowing"
I have a idea for you why not get a bike pump get that container belt using 4 to pick up the dirt with my Knotts this use the same system says another one and says you that and then compress the two bike pump Inns or whatever they're called I don't really know what they're called so but like you could like push out the sign so then I could go then announce the Linux like okay and that's then
Just move to Texas and you get tunnels in your backyard for free! And if you're impatient there are tons of consultants you can hire there with extensive experience at tunneling so silently it's like they're not even there!
This is complete madness.. you sir (colin) are a very clever and competent nitwit.. I absolutely love it. If this is not your absolute life accomplishment project, your futur is scary.
im surprised he didnt make a colin conveyor belt to take out the sand
Where are the guns, explosives and drugs?
Neat'O Brother. Love it! Thanks for sharing 😀👍❤🇨🇦🇬🇧🎉🎉💯💯
You've really out done yourself this time Colin! 😁
What kind of music is playing at the end of the video (12:16)?
I want to be his neighbor
How can he just dig without the fear of breaking any pipelines or pre-existing structure?
Minecraft in real time and real world :D
You like Indian men who build houses in earth
Just wondering have you ever invented anything that is actually unique end of youth to the general public
IDEA: You mentioned a while back your local RAF Airport could use a good "sweep". Sounds like an opportunity for a "Royal Furze RAF Airport Jet Sweeper, Blower and Airplane Tug Tender"...thing.  Really enjoy everything you've created and the enthusiasm fueling your endurance.  All the best!  Mark - from the U.S.A..
The crack in the floor off the corner of the hatch frame 👀
Check out the channel life of tom he has some things in motion and I think he could benefit from your input
The free trade app says it's not available in my country?! I'm in west Sussex 😅
You may have the opportunity for a spin-off project here ... develop a ridiculously overpowered suction excavator to help you dig in tight spaces 😇😉
What a boring 😏 project 🤭 #theBoringCompany
Such a childhood dream ! On par with a miniramp in my backyard
I assume the planning office has a dedicated guy to deal with Colin Furze home modifications lol.
video idea - plastic paraglider??!!
ебать грунт тяжелый
Modern day Mad scientist!
It's not very secret.lol
I realy want screw tank in nitro types please
SECRET TUNNEL SECRET TUNNELLLLLL
hey colin a few years/decades ago my sister asked me to try and make a detachable double buggy/pram...i didnt have the tools...but a double pushchair that can be detached into two pushchairs i would love to see you do that
Issues with neighbours?
This is my life long dream since I was 5 years old.
Go get some large Auger bits and a hydraulic motor. Quick and quiet.
Love how he tagged minecraft 😂
Everyone knows Colin needs an efficiency 5 pickaxe
Okay this is a dumb idea you're master of making dumb ideas smart when the tunnel connects to your house make an elevator but it can't be Electric
Why you didn't made tatoos with a blueprint?  El Chapo needs you for escaping now...a team of German Mining Engineers is too expensive for him
Big dog too much work go rent a hammmer with a chisel on it and you just dig out the flufff
Colinfurze ... is happy:)
Ahh I knew there would be a reference to the great escape I love that movie
Colin please get a oxygen reader and get proper ventilation in there. Saftey first.
“SECRET TUNNEL!!!” 🎵🎵🎵
Hey Colin,  Fantastic project. Can't wait to see how it progresses.  What music is that playing at about 12:15 when you start the March 2020 "Lockdown" montage?  It doesn't seem to be any you have listed (unless I missed it), and I can't find it on Shazam.  Can't get enough of it and what a perfect thing to play for that part of it.  Love it!
If Adam Savage was British
HURRY UP PART 3
The music in my opinion is bad but other than that great video
Is there anything this guy can't do? 🤣
I wanna own some property so i can do stuff
I love the great escape reference
if colin ever sells that house and the new owners have no idea who he is, its gonna make for a hella ofa story
how have I never heard of this channel with 11.1 million subscribers
you need a rototiller one of those small one's and electric
NOO DONT CREATE A SHORT-HANDLED SPADE THE ATF WILL COME SHOOT YOUR DOG!
If I was one of Colin's neighbors, I think I'd be subscribed to his channel...  After I saw this, I think I'd retain a lawyer...
must be very awkward if he moves
"The Danish Invader" means something completely different here in the States.
1.7k people why?
I have seen people drink coke before
stocks scare the hell out of me
He know dedication
Haha band practice! Thats Golden!🤣
How often are you going to post these!?
#MINECRAFT
Selling this house in 10 years is going to awkward
Hey EVERYBODY this guy has got a SECRET tunnel under his house!!
Make drill
I mean I don't want it to happen, but how is Colin not dead?
Look up how ww1 sappers dug tunnels under the front in ww1. They had to work in complete silence because of enemy listening posts, so you might take a page from their book
It places the lotion in the basket...
This is one of my dream projects! Awesome.
Well Colin it’s not very secret if you post videos about it online for everyone to see
Why is it tagged minecraft
Love how you put on your muddy black Etnies to keep the fancy black Etnies clean :D
Epic stuff going on!
can a building/mining engineers confirm the "studs" used to hold the bracing? minimal contact point to all the lime seems counter productive
In italy this type of project  are very frequently in house of mafia man ...Colin if somebody call you from italy dont accept:)
You Sir, Are a Tobacco  chewing ,Work Horse of a Man.
Secret tunnelllllllll secret tunnellllll
4mln peoples know about Your secret tunel so.. it isnt secret now XD
Reminds me of a prison escape.
This is what every kid dreams of doing. I know I wanted to dig a massive hole and make a bunker with some of my friends as a kid. I’m soooo excited to see progress.
Mr.Preeper! But in real life!
the secret tunes that is only known by 3.6 million people xD
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh this is every man's fantasy come true. digging a tunnel under ones own home. i cant even wowowowowowowowow
That soil looks dead
What's the song name at 12:20 ? It's not in the description...
Not a secret if you post it publicly
It's always cool to see people playing Minecraft IRL.
I wonder how much the colorful plastic dirt-holder weighs when full...
Parafuso de Ariquemes e esteira de transporte facilitaria muito!!
Out of curiosity, is this legal? It's super fun to watch the process, but it sure seems like something you could get in trouble for doing.
Can't be too excited having a 15 months break lol
I Always dreamed of doing this myself. Nice .... I'd hate to be the stock boy where he buys his cereal .  So Now we know what you did most of lockdown NICE WORK DUDE....EH
Imagine pulling this off without the missus knowing
YESSS i forgot i was waiting for this! Few days closer to the next upload :D
Looks like your property was a parking lot years back from the stuff your digging up.
Collin: so I did some off camera mining
This guys playing minecraft in real life
Why couldn't you just use the soil drill to take bulk out?
I'm Canadian! Can't get in to this app =T
well aint that like minecraft in real life?
I wonder if his neighbours check out his channel whenever they think he's up to something.
I want to see a colinfurze digging hose that vaccums up dirt and has a drill/hammer on the end
So how long until he's under the German line?
Me and my buddy always wanted to dig tunnels to our houses under ground when where 8
Imagine he sells his house at some point and doesn’t tell the buyer about the tunnel, so the buyer is just ripping up some flooring and finds the tunnel.
How can you say it s à secret tunnel when more than 3M watched your vids
I don't really see how London is at risk but whatever
3:53 fun funeral
Seems like a good spot to hide all the kids in the basement.  :D
This project has got to be my favorite ever, the 3 story beach hut was what got me into watching you so this is full circle and next level of a project
I never thought a man digging a hole could be entertaining! ;-)
Fuck neighbours. I'll be running breaker from morning till late, my property so fock off,
east germans fleeing towards west berlin 1965 colourized
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrGP5_rExVI   **goes through all this trouble to make it secret**   **post YouTube video**
A strand-jack crane to get the TBM lowered into position :-)   I'm surprised it hasn't turned into a sump for ground water.
El narcotraficantes watching ur videos :D
Who sticks a thumbs down for this!! Furzey you need to find these people and burry them in the tunnel.
As a kid, me and my friend wanted to dig a secret cave. Being only 12 years old we quickly realized it takes longer than a day and gave up.
6:10 that’s what she said
I like how I come back after a couple years and the theme and vibe is the same.
if the police ever investigate his property they are gonna have a field day lmao
Can we call it a SECRET tunnel with 3.5M of viewers ?
Yeah, so there is no Covid in England??? 1:51
wait no one can hear you down in your bunker?
6:08 - 6:12 "that´s what she said" 😂
When he sells the house the buyers are going to have a whole lot of questions haha
You should add a super secure door down in your bunker, with like a keycard reader or a decontamination chamber...
Did u need planning permission
should have soundproofed your shed a looooooooooooooooong time ago...
how do you get planning permission for all this? Tunnels, bunkers etc? Would really like to know...
This is just plain awesome I love how you modernized the whole project. You earned a sub and like
should have rented a belt...... Im sure the sponsor could afford it.
That "the great escape" reference was genius.
12:17 Really evocative chord progression coupled with centering on the word "lockdown". Beautiful. 💚
Only a British person would dig a tunnel while wearing a dress shirt and neck tie.
Definitely get some sort of Air Monitor device. IDK if it's an issue across the pond, but stateside we have big issues with stuff like Radon gas, even at the relatively shallow depth you're working at (some people have it in their basement)
"someone forgot their dirt in the restaurant, again"
mexico to usa drug smugglers would have this done in a week. comeon!
Hello. You are have air?
This is some giga chad level stuff.
Dig Dug in real life.
3:53, I love the idea of band practice to cover any noise. Haha
We all know he’s got pissed off neighbors who complained and that’s why he says this every time
"Secret" tunnel.  3.5M views.
Bro just use a diamond shovel with efficiency V and you’ll finish digging in no time.
Imagine buying his house....
Looking forward to the next part Colin your really making me think about a bunker under my house
Of course Colin would be the type of guy to have a secret mining operation in his shed.
For side ways and quietness you can use a hand drill .
Interesting seeing projects he did two-three years ago because of 'neatness', only to find out its just to empower his secret project.
If the apocalypse happen man there's going to be hundreds or thousands of people going to colin's house lmfao
When I was maybe 10 or 11 watching batman, this is the type of shit I wished I could do when I grew up.
This man legit predicted the apocalypse and built a bunker 5 years ago and no one’s talking about it.
You could put rooms on this tunnel like a pinpong table room, pool room, restroom... etc.
I like you bro. cause you respect your neighbors. You are lot of fun to watch.
Colin just building a full-on Minecraft house
Colin is the reason we should fear artists because they have the ingenuity to create a custom made hydraulic digging tool in order to dig an escape tunnel to their house because they decided it would be cool to have a tunnel
1:36 damn colins packin
Sir, do you have a license for that? EDIT: Limestone is reactive to vinegar, maybe its a fact that can be useful sometime
you look like Nikolaj Coster-Walder
You are totally bonkers sir
Thanks you inspire me to diging near bank building
New title: How to find Saddam Hussein
This guy is living out his inner child, i'm actually jealous!.
What about fluds?
Wow that’s alot of hard work.
doesn't want his neighbours to know about it but posts on youtube and 3.5 million people have watched it so far.   wonder if his neighbours are one of the millions haha
Title: " Digging a secret tunnel" views: hhmmm....... Interesting
What we all wanted to do as kids....and when we started to... our dad's would lose their minds about us digging up their backyards...like they had forgotten what they wanted to do as kids....your kids must have a blast Colin! 🤣
Soooo.... why no wheelbarrow? And _why_ would you not wear ear protection?! Not even when using an actual jackhammer!
I dont think its secret anymore. Unless you are from Men in black and going to give use flash
When will the next video come out? Can wait anymore😂
Hey try using a power post hole digger & a centrifuge vacuum to remove the dirt! Building a tunneling machine probably would be allot of fun to do & would be interesting to see done!
Yes keep digging soon we'll be under the bank mohahahhaha
THIS MAKES ME SO HAPPY I've ALWAYS wanted to make tunnels, SO BAD.
It's not secret anymore [insert evil laugh]mwahahhahaha
And.  are you not going to hit the water table at some point?
Are you preparing for the WW3? 😂
So you are all about inventing things.  Why are you manualy rolling back the carpet and lifting the door? Auto carpet roller and door opener please.
For a second I though he hit a gas line when it was a crack 😂
Could ask el chapo to help you
Really excited about this series. I love adventure and exploring. Plus, it is all at the expense of your hard work and all I have to do is sit and watch it.
Colin : this is a secret project so ı will put music wen ı will dig the ground Colins all neighbors watching Colins Chanel to now where the sound comes from :my goals are beyond your understanding
Can’t wait for part 3
How's that a secret tunnel if the map is clearly available publicly on YouTube?...…..Hope Dark Wizards don't watch this video!  Other than that, Gj Furze!
Who could dislike this
You should build a TBM ...
This guy sounds like Harry from sideman
El Chapo would approve of this.
It's called a wheelbarrow
Please don’t tell me he actually did that suff 2:00
“Secret tunnel! Secret tunnel! Through the mountain! Secret, secret, secret, secret TUNNEL!” - Nomad from atla
I love the amount of effort to keep this a secret….to just post it on YouTube
This is awesome. I love the underground bunker and the idea of underground tunnels. I think it would be very furze to build a mini tunnel borer somehow. This is great but I would love to see that! And less hard work for you!
Now this is not s secret
Saddam hussien
He kinda reminds me of the preper from zombi
I think you must have KULI JAWA
amazing
Do it with a piece of stick like in the primitive technology
God, this guy is fucking insane, I love his videos
THANK YOU, for the Great Escape references! I was hoping for it.
all i want to know is what is down that hole!!!  plz tell us
Why did I get minecraft flashbacks and cringe at digging straight down lol
why not use an auger to do lots of this ground work.
Not complaining but it will be probably like a year till he posts the next one what I would advise to him would be to like one week or month just all day all night work for 24 hours then take a 12 hour sleep and repeat it for the next month and just get it done quickly that’s just my suggestion because I’ve made a big bunker like that before and it took 6 months but I did have the help of 5 of my friends and when we stuck on that for the next 6 months and then we had a massive underground bunker and then we made a tunnel net work to the other smaller chambers in the bunker
Are their any legal issues associated with digging yourself a hole like that in the UK? Like any special permits that are needed or anything?
Hi Colin, what's the name of the background track used at the end of the video?
Need a pneumatic hammer
4:56 damn colin now I wanna try lmao @colinfurze
Okay he said it’s the middle of September… it’s not tho?
People underestimate the work and time involved in digging a hole. Digging a tunnel is exponentially more of the same. Just think about the effort that goes into creating smuggling tunnels.
I just wanna appreciate. How much hard work you do.
They somehow busted El Chapo out of a prison in Mexico City like this. Crazy to think about that.
Well  its no more secret ....
You should ask Sting to help you I hear he's a good digger.
5yrs from now, Colinfurze gonna rob a bank and name his teammates with city names.
Your secrets all over youtube.....
But what happened to the crack
I'm no mining engineer but that bracing looks like the weakest stuff I've ever seen used in a cave/mine. Be safe buddy.
do u normaly shit with both lids up?🤔🤣
Furze micro tunnel boring machine! hehe not like you don’t have enough on your plate!
These stock 'investing' apps are the epitome of:  If the service is free you are the product. Gamestop was just the beginning.
My father participated doing this in Germany in stalag Luft 3.  He was on the Team that  designed and made the air pump for the tunnel.  He flew 9.5 missions over Germany until getting shot down by a JU-88 on the way to Stuttgart Germany.  He only made to the staging barracks for the guards noticed the escape.
I don’t think your structure would do anything to hold back a collapse.  Please install proper shoring!  We don’t want to lose you.
Sponsored shit
Try  A gas powered post hole digger 👍👍
If a guy in Plymouth, Indiana, USA, Earth knows about your "secret tunnel", is it really secret? Did you pull the appropriate permits and have health and safety over?
hey chat don't forget to autoLike before you've even seen the video it's usually too good to unlike so just sit back and enjoy the content after a quick preLike  <3 as always keep up the ingenuity Colin, we love it <3
I think he will just need some lead shielding and a underground middle silo, to complete the complex. Might be the best footage for a brand like Estes rockets lol
Not very secret.
Your capitol is at risk 😂😂😂😂
Years ago my buddy, Jared Y., said if we ever lived next to each other he would dig a secret tunnel between our basements and he would sneak in while I wasn't home and steal just one sock each time, taking part of a new pair each time
I could do that in 20 seconds in minecraft lol
Super secret for the world to see😮
Are ya digging to China mate?
He's literally breaking the first rule of Minecraft
Respect for trying to keep noise complaints down to a minimum
Got any bank near?😎
Seems to me like Colin is building a bat cave🥴
Like his neighbor's don't watch his YouTube Channel and know exactly what he's doing.
How are you going to keep Dee Dee out? Also surprised your not using an auger bit with a hydraulic drill or a rotary hammer when neighbors are out.
Easiest way to dispose of soil, is dig another hole, and put it in there.
Surely you're at least 10 feet deep now. No one is hearing anything now.
Colin Furze is really becoming the british version of the american nuclear family.
Oi, punk, you got a loicence for that?
This guy is crazy xD
Nah but frfr, you should've called the hommies who make the underground pools in the middle of bfe
with this video I am even more confident in my claim that i would hate being your neighbourgh
Absolute mad lad
So what's the legalities of land ownership and what you actually own? Do you legally own only the surface or to a particular depth or all of it to a diminishing point at the core of the Earth?
Colin certainly intends to live out his life "in" that property. I wonder what age he'll reach when he can no longer climb down the ladders? 😭
The music is terrible in this vid.
I love this project so much! :D Heck yeah
The lockdowns around the world have screwed up a lot of projects. I can tell you're disappointed with the year delay. A whole fucking year of your life. Surely the neighbours are negotiable and amenable to some noise between a particular time range. I'm surprised they need it absolutely silent.
You fucking mad lad. That’s amazing. Where have you been my whole life. Holy shit. This is absolutely bonkers and I love it so much! You have my subscription.
Plot twist: there's a bank with a pregnant vault next door.
I'd love to have a setup like this.  I would hire people to do it, of course.  I'd have to bus them in every morning with blacked-out windows and take them back every night, with a GPS jammer so they can never know where they are.  Christ, this is already getting expensive.
It's like watching a spoiled hyperactive rich kid
I feel bad for the person to get cereal box full of dirt
The hell is the mayor of Albuquerque doing after work every day? Shouldn't he change first?
I wonder if he can fabricate a makeshift micro-TBM (Tunnel boring machine) for the next part...
rule number 1: if it's a secret, don't disclose it! If there is an apocalypse, your neighbors will kill you to steal your food and your bunker!
Fritzel approves this project! =))))
Hummmmmmm
Watching you dig without using a wheelbarrow is infuriating. Bruh, spend 10 seconds planning.
Imagine finding a cave under your terrain. That's him.
TWO LOVERS...
Уж не в посольство ли России? Чтоб подбросить им новичок?)
Why not just buy a post hole shovel?
what about the draft, where was it coming from?
Mexican cartel ..... we could do this in 3 days
all I could think when he hit the secret whole in the ground and that there was a "gust of wind" that it was natural gasses and that his shed is gonna blow up one day when it accidentally gets ignited. Or that he was gonna gas himself out and pass out from the fumes
Remember kids, dont do cocaïne or you will finish like this guy tu me tue Billy xD
Have you not heard of a wheelbarrow ? Or a entrenching tool (small pointy spade)
Technicaly, is not secret anymore :/
minecraft never straghit down dig him no u
when youre playing minectaft with your friends and link your bases up
I just realized that i never subscribed
Try a hydraulic auger instead.  Augers bits are available in multiple diameters  2 inch - 10 inch plus.  Much faster.   Consider a Contractor Grade vacuum for removing the spoils from the bore.  Again, they come in all sizes, up to being able to pull roofing gravel up 10 story building.   Not in your budget ?!  They are well within your fabrication set up, and skill set.  Use whatever power source fits your needs and modify existing systems.   You seem to be able to lay your hands on "More Power", at will.  That, and you don't let "voiding the warranty" crimp your ventures.   Probably a good thing I'm not your insurance agent. He probably buys his anti-anxiety/Blood pressure Meds in industrial bulk quantities.
Why didn’t you keep doing it during covid?
This whole channel is the perfect balance between "HELL YEA!" and "NOPE! NOPE! NOPE!" and I mean PERFECT balance! But I want to remark that calling a tunnel "secret" and putting everything about it on a channel with 11 mil subscribers is a bit strange.
I'm pretty sure the city council isn't going to be as happy as you are with that hole in the ground there Colin
What are the details on your plasma cutting table ?!  Looks to be a perfect size for a lot of small shops.  Self-built ?!  Purchased ?!  If so, Where ?!  Price range ?!
This poor trombone
Minecaft get better graphics?
I can’t download free trade cause I live in Aus
"Secret tunnel! Secret tunnel!"
How is it that Colin hasn't been knighted yet?
2:55 the process of equiping a short barrel to your LOCUS for Quick ADS
Love your videos but that rock music is so bad. Please stop using that crap
"Dave dug a hole"
Build a drill and drill holes. Will be a lot faster
Awesome job Colin! Don't give up on it!
You should make some sort of corkscrew to help with the dig. If it’s not finished 😃
We out here making sawed off shovels now
I feel bad for the poor kid that just wanted a bowl of cereal to start his Monday morning…
I'd love to see the council planning permission for that
Ha ha ha! This is the Swedish prime minister. What a joke he is🤣🤣. And what can we say about his English? 😂😂😂😂 https://youtu.be/sMNJxzakNkw
I’m getting exhausted just watching you.  Nothing is worse than digging.  I’d rather shingle a roof in the summer
Colin should have tried a ground auger, their kinda quite but still loud
colin can you make a homemade jet pack
Did anyone else recognize the sign change in the danish shop?
Make chinook Box from rust, it's looks good
Imagine digging a tunnel in front of 3.4 million people and still calling it a "secret"
"Secret Tunnel" that only 3.5 Million people know of, so far.
absolute madlad
did he really put dirt in a store
Doraemon comes true here!
The secret tunnel build on YouTube. Makes sense.
Solar and wind turbine
Needs to keep the noise down while digging. …while using every power tool known to man
you are so crazy ..... and we like it 🤗
This guy is a crazy genius.
minecraft irl
Have you though about using sound proof Materials in the shed to allow for small sds drills to be used?
sponsor for the video: pablo escobar
Neighbor aka neighbour: Colin hasn't been digging for a while now, should we ask if he's ok
How legal is this?
когда не хочешь искать работу
Any guesses as to how tall the tunnel will be?  Will it be walk through or crawl through?
I honestly don't have personal interests with the ad, I only stuck around for more of comical bits lol
So is it gonna be 1 year 3 months for part 2?
saddam hussein
colin, why is your tiolet seat all up? or is this a secret invention of your own?
Hey Colinfurze, quick idea for you, maybe building a conveyer belt leading out of the shed would help with dirt disposal to save multiple trips out of the shed, what do you think?
Almost looks like a gold mine. I explore those
1:35 : DDDDDD
Neighbors: what's your exercise routine? Furze:
When you finish this project would you like to make the Umbrella from the movie Kingsman???
I love you, you made all boys and men’s dream come true
Can you make an automated cheese toasty machine?
9:35 I was expecting you to say "...hit rock bottom..."
6:45 Anyone is here who know what machine is it ? I think that it will be plazma cutter or laser but I am not sure. Could you help me?
but uhhh where does that crack go?
how about a little quiet, unobtrusive fracking?
your posting this on youtube, why are you being quiet? with the silent diggin and what not
It's interesting to think how your creations could be there for hundreds of years
Coin You need to build a tunnel boring machine when you get to the desired depth!!
You like a modern-day Caractacus Potts. One of your next builds NEEDS to be Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.
Im still upset there was no 10m sub fireworks!
But where did you actually put all of the rock and dirt? im genuinely curious haha
@colinfurze can me and a friend come help you dig Terry the tunnel
You need a digging bar
My wife wants to know where your canary is?
Love what your doing Colin but what would happen if you ever sold your house and moved  ??
Pulsejet powered TBM?
I dont know why but as a side project for you, id love to see you build either an Insane Potato gun, Or a straight up DANGEROUS pressure washer.
Who else is like I’ve been watching him for two years and he hasn’t bought a new camera
question, if you had to buy a mig welder home use what type, parweld, lincoln, gys ?? and synergic or transformer type?? cheers
Colin is the hardest working man on Youtube.
Question, why not make a boring drill like the boring company? Mount a Electric motor with a plate and flat bar welded to the plate at a digging angle with a sharp edge
How secret is it ? did you not have to apply for planning permission ?
Where did the hole with the air go?
No massive auger bit that drills a cylindrical hole and draws the spoil up to the surface and a skip?
Best content combined with the literal worst music genre ever conceived by humanity
“On this next episode, I build an underground city!” -Colin, probably
Could have used an auger
The whole world can now see that you're building an underground bunker. But as long as the neighbor never finds out, s'all good!
That looks...exhausting.
This makes me wonder how deep you're actually allowed to dig before it isn't your property anymore. Could you technically just dig down to the core of the Earth and that would still be considered your property?
Am i the only one getting mr.prepper vibes from this
This is awesome 😃
Whahahaha, found any relics from ancient times?
Me: Building something like this in Minecraft This dude: I got bored well time to dig secret tunnel
Waiting for the next episode can’t wait anymore
Plese
I just hope ppl learn how to secure diging holes ..................... when u die under there............ crazy bruv
Wen is 3
Bloody love it! Although im a bit miffed on how lovely and dry your soil is. I dug 2 metres under my place in London for a baby cellar and I have had to install a water pumping system to keep the water level down! :-)
Where does the crack goes to?
HAHAHAHA! I love that you're making digging seem fun... somehow.
Haven't you heard? Never dig straight down
Is this a job application for digging tunnels under a certain wall ? silently :-) Love this craziness. I was dreading a cave in ...and right when i was planning on commenting - there go the side"walls"... In my area you would get so much water sepage that a mesh wouldnt do anthing :-(
Question about the nice music that starts around 12:17 (March 2020). What/who is it? Could you update the Music section of description?  thank you so much
A SECRET TUNNEL  public on youtube  ;-)
But Colin! How can it be a "secret" tunnel when it's all over youtube?! :D
Cool!
Chaotic Neutral Bill Nye
Add a elevator to get down
This guy gives mad scientist a run for their monies 🤣
secret to who?
How does this guy get planning permission for all this mad shit?
I wonder which episode will show him building the missile silo?
Mhhmm is this illegal ???
#minecraft is the tags 😂😂😂😂😂
I highly doubt that little bit of steel tub can resist the earth pressure if that thing were to collapse. There is a reason a lot of tunnels and shafts are round not squares.
Hey bro can we do a video together please comment if yes
How have I manage to avoid this channel for years??? I can't believe I'm only discovering this gold mine now...
Is it just me or does he look like he’s digging gold at the beggining
You are properly mad!!
5:44 I cant be the only one that thought the next transition was going to be with his head facing out of the toilet bowl right?
Why #minecraft
Finally cleaned my system off the genital herpes with the medication i ordered from Dr.ademise
3kk clicks , SECRET ENTRANCE .. yes
seen like MR.PREPPER
Haaaaaaa! I can't wait no more! It's tooooo amazing
English accent + tunnel dig: was immediately worried with you just carrying the dirt out in buckets instead of the ol´ dirt-socks in the trouser pocket trick.
Before 2030 your home will be the new anti-apocalypse fortress
1:35 :)))
How exactly is it secret tho ?
I appreciate that this took a long time, and he wants to wring every bit out of it, but honestly, a fifteen minute video to cut a square in the floor, and a separate 15 minute video to dig straight down from that square. It's a bit much. We'll get to see the finished project by this time next year.
If ww3 ever happens you will be set to survive
Давай ещё =) Отличная шахта.
It puts the stone in the basket or it gets the hose again.
This is brilliant 🤣🤣
This is giving me serious flashbacks to the archaeological dig I was on last month. Less madness though, maybe?
you should bild a mini bachhao
Colin Farts?
Helllo from bulgaria
my boy out here engineering tunnels in skate shoes lul
2:15 The funniest thing I've seen today
Good on you lad, your dedication is truly remarkable
What is the outcome of that "crack"? And where is the air coming from?
I thought for a minute you were going to find Desmond from lost
Tem uma ferramenta no Brasil chamada "carrinho de mão" ia ajudar
What about electric and sewer pipes or worst an unexpected natural cave???
Love the music soooo much on this one
Where is Saddam Hussein?
Colin: digs straight down and hits a hollow spot  Steve: *unimpressed facial expressions*
And he digs in a tie, that’s a definite first.
And I had a hard time getting a permit for my garage... Imagine going to the officials with something like this.
I don't think is that secret when 3.3 milion people saw the plan
ผมจำได้ ผมเคยดู  underground bunker สุดจัด ปลัดยังงง
Most people who go to this much trouble are chasing gold or freedom.
I think what you need now is a tunnel drill.
So cool
Let's hope all 3.3 million of us keep this project a secret...
Your videos become more shit every week.... Sorry to say that I was here for 5 years. But now all I can see is advertising and really unfunny ideas. Beeing such a big Youtuber must be fucking easy. Posting the wackiest content with nearly zero effort in it and gathering thousand of dollars. Can't enjoy your channel anymore
By how much have these projects increased the value of your house??
I’m digging this video
when I was in the gulag I dug a tunnel to escape, to hide the soil I removed I dug another tunnel and put it in there. . eating lots of porridge for energy it took no time at all. . PS think gas, methane & blackdamp, both dangerous, 1 explodes 1 suffocates you,  you need a davy lamp or nowadays an electronic tester.
I assume he owns the property otherwise he'll be in deep shit with the landlord  (How does he have so much energy gets like an incarnation of the doctor)
I assume the Gap with a breeze and you threw water down came to nothing or have a missed a bit :) thanks for the enertainment.
my child dream !
Colin makes “secret” tunnel yet he’s sharing this with 11 million people
Colin is mad but you just gotta love him. Not only is he a brilliant engineer and inventor but he's such a positive person too. Kids this is a role model.
Главное не перестараться и случайно не прокопать тоннель под Ла-Манш))
What's the point calling tunnel a "secret" while you show it on yt :D
When I see the video picture your age shows if you think. "you puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again"
colin: making a secret tunnel so no one finds out also colin: (posts it on youtube)
Can't get freetrade in Australia..
dude just poured dirt into a coco puffs box and put it onto the shelves in the supermarket. imagine buying coco puffs for the first time, open the box, see some ground and have a bite.
would be quite funny if that crack led to a huge cavern and you just fall through into a big underground lake... and.... deep in the darkness a glowing red being with a whip in his hand... a firey demon appears... and you then scream "THIS FOE IS BEYOND ANY OF YOU... FLY YOU FOOLS!"
Something tells me el chapos henchmen are watching
what about Radon gas?
i tried to dig a hole in my back garden when i was a kid, when my dad went on holiday... I think i got about 4 metres deep  and i started also going sideways... probably was dangerous though... a lot of it was sand... when dad came home he got annoyed and filled it back in (i was digging with a cup and then a trowel)
alternative  soundtrack for this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytWz0qVvBZ0  ps: mb colinfurze is a dwarf?
Okay but did that crack lead to a cave? How are you not more curious?
Me and the boys on our way to China
Imagine the person who someday gets the house, “ here’s the bunker and here’s is the tunnel that connects the house the shed and the bunker
You are braver than me. I'd use hydroexcavating myself. Brits do that yet?
I just subbed you seem interesting to watch
Hello  i hope your well, my name is kozmo all the way in south africa. i need to contact you directly either email or a call. i have a project i would like to discuss with you when you can spare but a moment of your time. i do believe it will be worth a listen. and venturing into.  kind regards kozmik kozmo
The El Chapo crossover we have all been waiting for!
colin! you forgot the number one rule! NEVER dig straight down
hiting the limestone - all egyptians that made kilometers of tunels under egypt in limestone bedrock without mechanization few thousand years ago, are we joke to you
I need to know if he actually left a cereal box full of dirt and if someone grabbed it 😂😂
50 year: later I made my bunker an underground nuclear factory that flies!!!

Saddam Hussein
Суперкрутой чувак, но он бы быстрей проходческий щит сместерил, чем эту яму копал
Where is Saddam Hussein?
YES! Now that's how you make a YouTube video!
The planning department hates him
Should have gone at it with a Post Boarer then shovel out the loose soil
What next? Digging a secret bunker with nuclear generator? Making underground food farm? Creating a rocket for traveling to mars? Ok, I'll wait  :D
Saddam Hussein made a plastic surgery.

I went into this video thinking it was just going to be a video about digging     *boy I was wrong*
nel bro, tu necesitas contratar al chapo, el es experto en túneles :v
*El Chapo Wants To Know Your Location.*
Dear lord someone take those poor abused instrument s away that was so far out of tune my god that poor trumpet and Trombone
Random question: do you have to get permits for all this?
Cop come by why are you digging a hole are you trying to rob a bank
Crazy!
I thought you would make a drill with a conveyor belt
Recommends this. nice
You should have a Calvin Klein sponsorship ;)
iI HAVE A BETTER IDEA FOR YOU A AIR POWER HIGH PRESURE GUN  WITH A LONG PIPE .. TINY PIPE NOZZLE
Dude you need a drill and a conveyor belt to move up dirt.
One day your just gonna sell your house and some one is gonna have all of this and be like "the original owner must have been crazy or some" or "wow this guy must have been a cool person
Not really a secret if u tell us about it
Part 3 pleaseeeee!!!!
nope
Be careful to the soil failure. Suggest to put a support to the soil while digging down or for the tunnel
How freaking cool is this?!
It's not really a secret anyone considering that alot of people watch his videos.....

I absolutely love you and wish I had you in California to help on my land  In Oregon! I spent a summer in the West Midlands and absolutely miss England but gotta get my shelter made soon. We all know something's coming especially you're in the States So saying it's now July July 7th is my birthday? Can you put out part Number 4? Thank you bless and love this

Should wear safety helmet, just in case the basket breaks loose from you lifting it…
How do you deal with structural things and whatnot? I would imagine this could affect the foundation around your house, which your insurance company may not love :P have you had a structural engineer out or anything?
And then Haddam quessin is to the right
Colin! Why didn't you build yourself a jet powered auger!?!?!?
Whoever has this house next is going to have the best life anyone could ever live
Next....
Finally u invented MPL-50!
"Secret tunnel, secret tunnel,  secret secret tunnel!!" - a random dude from the last airbender
Um yeah, that is extremely dangerous with only mesh holding back the earth. You should shot crete the walls and add in more reinforcement to ensure your not burried alive... there is a reason why road excavation for sewer pipe installs use giant steel cages to protect the workers..
But wait… is it just movie magic, or that I live in Texas and it’s always 100°F / 38°C , but how are you doing all this hard labor without even breaking a sweat???
Did you call JULIE? Uh, well I guess there you call DFB.
I’m a framer.   I’m going to start wearing a shirt and tie to work so I can be cool like Colin.  😎

Good project

First video I watch on this channel, I subscribed automatically after seeing the title.
My man is recreating Saddam's tunnel for sure
the damn RPG tucked on the ceiling though XD
Are all your neighbours seismologists?
POV: you are re living it playing minecraft uhc building your faction
Nice who knew an old tactic from the great escape would still work today
this is my first time here and WHY DO YOU WEAR A TIE WHILE DIGGING
Why not just make an area for wires in the entrance and then just soundproof the top?
Thanks to Mythbusters I know who this guy is.
I hope I do stuff like you when I'm older
The fact it's taged #minecraft just ....
I'm so glad this video shows how hard it is to dig a hole in your back garden. Buried a few pets and for one dug a hole 5 foot deep, back breaking work. Took a solid 4 hours before it was wide enough all the way to the bottom.
Britain man digs secret tunnel underneath entire neighbiurhood
with all the stuff that gets done to this house I'm wondering how much  the value of it would have raised/lowered with all the extra stuff underground and such
I did that on day 21 of quarantine.
Awesome!
I been using free-trade for a lil while now and endeavor is a great lil project to buy shares in they own ufc, new York fashion week, the miami open and some other enterprises and at $25 ish a share they're expected to reach around $2000 a share soon they're a bargain atm

all that dirt? plz I dump it in the river, not illegal to do that because the river has dirt in it.
Dear Mr Furze,  I am looking forward to seeing the next instalment of the big dig! 👍🏼
You need to hire those guys who made everything with a strange tool in the nowhere!
Now that i think of it colin is kind of rick sanchez bc they both got a secret  basement bunker 😳
This guy just randomly things about a tunnel, and then digs it right in his workplace. I fucking love this
do you skate? I noticed you were wearing an element and a vans shirt in this video.
Jungle digging youtubers AMATEURS
Yeah, because I'd take financial advice from an online advert that can't tell the difference between capital and capitol.
Capital*

Where are you going to find enough bed planks?  Colin, this is possibly the most dangerous project you've ever attempted. Please stay safe!
I have already seen this pump thingi sometime ago .
Question when is the next video I hope its longer because I know it will take a long time tho be careful and make the tunnel long and big but better I wish I was there to help you dig that tunnel but sadly I live in the USA but I'm excited to see this tunnel built Be safe! 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
1:35 Collin u damn funny!
I want to see part three so bad
Minecraft player:
Is it a secret when you tell everyone about it?
we need a live stream of this!!!
Why in holy fuck is he doing this in a shirt and trousers?
I have hdhd my wife now wishes I didn’t watch this video I’m tunnelling to my shed
Wait I'm a fan don't get this wrong but 3 years to dig 12 feet down seems like a big stuff around I mean why not just get on with it working from home after all
Couldn’t you just sound proof the tunnel entrance and along with the depth of the tunnel you should cause a disturbance to the surrounding area allowing u to dig faster and more efficiently
I an LOVING this series 😛😛
Wait, you waited a whole year because you thought neighbors would hear you? You are so far underground now that there is going to be basically zero noise.
Part three is needed
Two lovers, forbidden from one another  A war divides their people  And a mountain divides them apart  Built a path to be together   ...Yeah, and I forget the next couple of lines, but then it goes...   Secret tunnel!  Secret tunnel!  Through the mountain!  Secret, secret, secret, secret tunnel! Yeah!
I wanna be around for a planning session. Colin and Mrs furze "right love, I'm gonna dig a huge tunnel from the workshop to the bunker" Mrs. F. "Assorted British profanities"
Do you usually dig in a tie? :D
I can't  believe he is actually doing this and then I remember he built a hunker lol
how many parts are there going to be?
Yo he playing minecraft
They do make spades Colin
Plot twist: He’s breaking his friend out of prison and this is his cover story for digging a tunnel.
Amazing video Col
I wonder how much this house would sell for
How does he get the planning  permission???

I wonder if you have considered making a powered minecart of some sort for transport between points, sort of like a sideways elevator with recall buttons at each entry point
This man is an absolute maniac. I love it :D
Is this guy married? He's not married, right? He can't be.
I said to myself when he was lifting the bucket out of the hole that you’d need a winch soo enough then bam next clip is you installing a winch😂
Why is ur seat up when ur taking a shit??
Comment to help algorithm
I was hoping he would build a digging machine.
Try looking up Hydro excavation. Cut your dig time in half
Beats me you had less in the bucket with a over head winch than you did by hand lol
I was wondering what he would accidently unearth!
Colin meets mole people
That guy is prepared for everything 😂 when there’s an apocalypse he’s the guy that can help you

hmmmm saddam huessien?
in like 50 years when this house is for sale there will be a reddit post on finding the hidden tunnel and bunker :p
Awesome!!!!

SECRET TUNNLEEEEE
Colin: Digs a secret tunnel as stealthily as possible. Also Colin: Uploads it to youtube :D
council just acting blind at this guys house haha
Something else I’ve always wanted to do!
wasted opportunity to make a underground digger
Building a bunker was cool but building a tunnel to the bunker is even cooler 😎
I your daughter's ever go missing that's the first place there gunna look
I once read an article about a man in Mexico who enjoyed digging tunnels on his property. He would dig out spaces in a hillside, then build little rooms and reinforce them with steel beams. He used it as a form of therapy. Eventually his family got mad that he was out there so much and eventually contacted the authorities and claimed he was doing underground construction without a permit. WHAT SNITCHES...
need TNT :D
This guy is good
you need to dig a hole and put soil in
Definitely skipped every sponsor plug, ever.
This is amazing
When do you think your video will be ready for digging sideways?
When will you come out with part 3?

What a crazy class project to do love it. Looking in from Ireland 🇮🇪
How deep is the ground water table in your area?
Just started watching you Colin. My go to channel now. Do your neighbours ever complain?😉
Hey Colin, you'd be better off using a couple of accumulators for the ram hammer you've got. Then it can be a slow + quiet jackhammer of sorts, instead of really really slow like a wood splitter.
youtube please recommend me video when he finally finishes this, i hope i'll be still alive by that day
i'll come back to this if i ever need to dig a tunnel for nefarious reasons
So are you going to put a lift in there?
Is your house in an area which can get radon gas? I know areas of Lincolnshire can have it. You need to get the air that's coming from the ground checked or it could cause cancer
Класс)))
Your neighbors must hate you
Don't recall last time I watched someone digg a hole. Wait, I never did...
It's not a secret anymore, is it?
It’s giving lovely bones vibes
Wanted to like for the element shirt, but the I saw I already liked the vid x)

Reminds me of Fred Dibnah when he built a mine shaft in his back garden.
I’m curious, what’s the back up plan for flooding? Like say there’s a flood in your street with the UK weather and all, wouldn’t your whole bunker be flooded? Idk how they prevent that in general.
this is so badass!
You should Build a small bucket Wheel excavator to dig out like the coal excavators
I didn't see the whole thing up to this point but... how did you get a permit for this
Oi, do you have a license for that tunnel?
U need a pneumatic showel xD
Plot twist - that crack was connected to the entrance to an ancient catacomb and a deadly pathogen has now been released causing a global pandemic...

GO MORE CRAZY!!!
Have you thought about something like an Archimedes screw to help remove material rather than filling bucket pull bucket up?    Something that you can fabricate, make a video about and all that rot.   Just saw your "underground beach hut" video and that seemed like a perfect use for one.
This is what happens when we have a Pandemic 🤔🙄.
Is it a secret if 3.1 million people know about it?
Worried about the shovel being loud so he starts cutting and welding metal
All that hard work when you could've easily used your legs to push the shovel in the ground and taken out the dirt that way lol
Imagin beeing an estate agent in 50-60 years and you had too sell his property. "No this house don´t got a pool...but it have a nice shed, a bunker a secret tunnelsystem and this underground helicopter-pad.

"nonsense on top of it" it´s soil, mate! good old mother earth
Never dig straight down pls you might take a lot of falldamage if you fall in a cave or fall in lava!
where do we put saddam hussein
The Pots of Hathsin
I love this, I've dug a 12 foot shaft Down like you and braced it, I'm a bit cautious about going forward and tunnelling while supporting it and eventually keeping it water tight so can't wait to see the engineering of how you tunnel and support as you go.
Maybe call Shelby for tunneling. :D
Not much of a secret if over 3 million people know about it but why not its fun anyway
yeah really "secret" 3M views lol
Just dig another tunnel and put the spoil in that one )
If there’s one thing all men like, it’s digging holes.
lmao - I was just thinking "ha its The Great Escape 2021" then you did the bit from the movie
secret tunnel: 3mln views o.O
I think there has been a noise complaint  made by the neighbours
digging a secret bunker and posting it on youtube
Whoever buys Colin's house when he moves is in for an absolute treat.
Crazy what a pandemic can do to someone
Is this even legal?? How did you not hit any utility lines
I'm outside digging holes, come in and watch somebody else digging a hole while having a beer....great job Colin.
the hydraulic system, all this time.. it was for SECRET DIGGING ??? - whow
7:30 ... wait, was this the reason for it all this time?????
Not so secret anymore
Colin: don't skip ad! Me: doesn't skip ad Ad: UK ONLY, go away! Me ....
You should use a post hole digger just dig a bunch of holes like a block of cheese. Should be able to dig 3’ at a time that way with ease just shovel out the broken up dirt once broke free.

this is all permitted right?
Now that you are into bedrock you can sell your waste as aggregate.

September? September of... 2019 then?? How hard was it to keep quiet about this project it's so cool!!  I'm still hoping you've run into a cave and get to expand your bunker and secret entrance/tunnel into a cave system :D
Why this man look related to Gordon Ramsay tho 😂

Colin Furze not making any noise!!??
Make a conveyor belt to carry out the dirt for you
IDK how much you're making off this but you've earned every penny!
What Colin thinks his neighbours will thinks when they hear him making loud noises in the shed: "Oh, he must be digging a tunnel!"  What his neighbours probably think: "Oh that crazy Youtuber is making another dangerous project."
colin starts minecraft...  builds an underground bunker, and starts digging a tunnel from the shed to the bunker...   minecraft loads into the main menu.
it hurts my back just watching this
You have a construction project going on at your home for work and you chose not to continue doing it during lockdown? That makes no sense. It’s one of the extremely few things you could keep doing during lockdown. Just find extra quiet ways to dig and remove the dirt. You had like 13 months, you could have made quite a bit of progress still.
Great video as always, just a word on your sponsor. Their website has been flagged as a Phishing site and unsafe. Of course can still do it, but it doesn't start well does it?
To weak construktion
You should sell jars of the dirt
Saddam Hussein hole
In germany Youd Need à Baugenehmigung
Every D.T teacher looks up to you
Ive just realized, people around the world are doing crazy shit right now
When a random kid get's the dirt coco pops tho .....
are you allowed to do that? or will the county shut you down if they find out?
Is it legal and safe to build under a building?

Imagine buying this guys house haha
Not very secret, considering the 3 million viewers

I knew this guy was a band kid first I saw him
Cannot wait for the horizontal tunneling
Plot: he’s actually digging a tunnel to the nearby bank vault
for me there is a difference between a hole and a tunnel
Wow I could dig that hole way faster in Minecraft. Get good noob.
This guy is playing Minecraft in real life
Don't hit bedrock
Why does this video have the Minecraft tag?
Ни черта не понятно , но оч интересно 😀
Whats crazy is you can dig and dig untill you fall through what is actually the ceiling of a massive sink hole or a cave. Lol
This is a mountain bikers dream dirt, I would suggest giving it or selling it to a mountain biker who wants to build a track
Colin you're mad lol,love your vids,always keeps me and the little one entertained,he wants to try your builds haha..cnt wait for the next episode on this project
7:18 I don't think that I have ever seen an English home garage that doesn't have a tin of Hammerite and a box of celebrations or quality street full of nuts and bolts.
I believe you spelled capital wrong
Day one in minecraft be like

Building a secret tunnel!!! Every engineers wet dream!! Good job Colin
build a mini shield tunnel boring machine
Your screte turnel is seen by just just 3 million people they don't gonna tell any anybody 😂😂😂
NOT SECRET ANYMORE 3 MILL PEOPLE KNOW NOW.
We've all seen those smuggling tunnels from Mexico to US on the news. The evil Furze is building a tunnel between Lincolnshire and Rutland to smuggle sausages under the border. Nobody is going to believe this smokescreen explanation here. Do you take us for fools?? Do you??
Well if he is showing millions of people his "SECRET" tunnel, I'm not sure if it's should be considered secret anymore -_-
Just watching this is giving me backache
Brothers of the mine rejoice!
What was that tunnel with air, you didn't tell us :(
The fact he is tiring to do this in secret makes it feel like he is escaping from a prison.
I'm disappointed by the lack of El Chapo jokes in the comments..
H O L E
he should have used the minecraft cheatcode
Excellent, the secrecy component of the the tunnel may be a little compromised.
I say how is this a secret tunnel!
Entrance hidden by bricks and rubble
He’s gonna get jacked from all the digging
challenge: do this but no fancy machines or metal supports you are allowed to use wooden supports. I call it the Vietcong tunnel challenge
dude made a nuclear bunker
Don't think I have ever seen a top rank youtuber actually work so hard.

There's a fart joke in there somewhere..

Do you need any permits?
Imagine he end up hitting treasure underground
This series is like the Avengers of the Colin Furze channel. Jumps through time, call backs to other videos (7:16), it's brilliant!! I've been won over.
На 3:10 англичанин придумал сапёрную лопату.
A hydraulic bucket wheel won't work sadly due to what appears to be a high clay content but have you thought of a similar system for excavating the face? failing that a hydraulic powered pressure cleaner might be useful for "Hydro excavation" just remember a bilge pump so you don't end up needing a snorkel :)  Side note for the future: Using a pully at the base of the initial shaft could redirect the winch to be able to drag a sled/trolley down the tunnel for ease of waste removal.
I don't know how to explain, but this guy can make a new video, released in Jun 2021 looks like early 2000s and this is amazing!
This dude is building a tunnel, while building the tools to dig the tunnel, while shooting all this in perfect angles
Colin: *casually vacums hair*
The next day the police are at the door because they think you're digging a tunnel to the bank xD
awwww Colin could you have not made a tunnel.digging machine with soil take away;) great job thou by hand
Colin I would suggest to put cement or something like that between the uneven wall of the tunnel and the mess because if earthquake comes the frame will be not more strong to handle it and by put cement the frame will get support enough to handle a normal earthquake. If this idea sounds not useful then atleast just reply pls ❤️ , I have been seeing you from your project of jet engine behind a bicycle 🚲.
COLIN MATE WHERES PART 3
Can't wait to see the next part
Some remarkable editing here Colin!
Doing a El Chapo
the freetrade link doesnt seem to be working.....? is it just me?
this may explain the lack of content over the last year or so, still miss the firework vids though
Why? just why?
Who Else First Saw Him On Tv
time to build a drill colin.
Most of Colin's projects are potentially lethal, and all the more jolly for that, but this is proper dangerous without shoring etc. He might be a brilliant engineer, but it would be a shame if a spade killed him off. I imagine his sponsors are thumbing through their insurance policy sharpish.
It's a good thing this man puts his brain to good and not evil 😅
Imagine id he ever sold this place. The new owners would be finding stuff everyday!
This tonnel isnt secret anymore
Real life minecraft by furze
It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.
Why not set up some cameras on your front to be able to check from your shed if your neighbours' cars are in their driveways?
It’s not a secret tunnel if you post it on YouTube. Js
Means the tunnel work will complete in far 2020, i think. As long tunnel sideways wont collapse. Sideways have higher risk for that than vertical tunnel down. Mesh is not good for sideways, because it leaks water and let some dirt through it. You're also digging in some history of ground. You might see stuff from history. Graves, leftovers from old buildings, old waste, old pipes, etc.  Tunnels is more warmer than outside basically, ventilation is needed.
Saddam Hussein
After doing all this digging. This person gonna get really buff.
I must say, I am really digging this project.
Secret tunnel? With a Youtube channel and 3 million views? :D
Well, it's just a tunnel now........ Also, how do you get approval for this? In the US, that bunker alone would have gotten you fines and county/city suits that would bury you financially for the rest of your life.
Meanwhile in my country i can't build a house on my own land :c
Secret tunnel, 3mln views :)
u  nob u cant put dirt in super market maybe soamoene buy that wake up for work oh yummy a bowl of dirt oh grea thank colin
This guy can hide at least 200 corpse and nobody would know
No longer a secret with 2.9M views
El Chapo would be proud
Nice video
This is when you hit rock bottom ( 9:30 )
He should build a panic room next
I liked this video before I had even started watching it :D
I bet next video he's gonna consider tnt

its verry secret, nobody knows about it.lol
Can you please do a video on some technical aspect of a humanitarian issue so that these videos aren't just amusement for the middle income bourgeois, may I suggest GRENFEL as that could be made amusing to the perpetual adolescents while also highlighting what is a ONGOING issue!
Thank you for showing me your secret tunnel that is a secret only to people that do not have YouTube. Which excludes everybody on planet Earth. However, I have absolute confidence that the martians from Mars will not be able to find you.
Not secret now😂😂😂
It’s definitely secret only 3m people know about
Who knew digging a hole could be so boring.
Make a bowling ball cannon to fire down the tunnel if anybody breaks in.

Oh, you are digging a 'Secret' tunnel, shame it would be if 3 million people knew about that.
When that super market owner while watching your video… 🤣🤣🤣🤣
That trumpet solo was impeccable

Millions watch man dig hole.... its great isn't it 🤣
Hello in this project I am going to try to get hernia
Never dig straight down
Wow Collin really has no idea about digging holes. Never dig 1x1 straight down
Awesome project but "secret" you've shared it on YouTube
Umm, so planning and local council laws and bs... we just gonna, yep ---> Skip
DIGGING A SECRET TUNNEL  -   IS NO SECRET ANYMORE!!!
I‘m so enjoying this videos

Diggy diggy hole
This is literally minecraft
Thumbnail made me think that was barny Stinson from how I met your mother
Who works in a tie???
Idk why but every project that you made, wakes my 6 year old self. Every time pure joy
My guy is literally playing minecraft in his shed
It's so secret the whole internet knows about it.
Well that's one way to hide a grow room
Put a #mincraft oh yeah you are put in #MinecraftAlready
This how it feels to play Minecraft in real life.  Go-go, Colin! 👍
This guy just knows what the fuck to do hahah
This isn't really secret the tunnel is posted on YouTube...
This guy's yard is gonna end up like a mine craft world that you done everything in
Bro why you carry the rocks put em on a dolly or something
So was the air coming from the subway tunnel underneath your house?
It  is'nt secret anymore if 3M humans have been seen that.😁😁
well, that's it then, isn't it? Colin's finally lost it. He's gone off the deep end. He's just got in't hole and kept on digging and next thing we'll hear about is "Stamford man emerges from manhole wearing tie. Terrified onlookers describe the scene as the blonde-bearded man disappears back into the ground"
Imagine being so committed to being a cartoon gadgeteer that you're designing custom digging equipment for the express purpose of keeping the noise down while you dig your *secret tunnel* to your *underground bunker.*
“SECRET TUNNEL!”
The tools your using in your shed are louder then digging lol. Leave a table saw on

Love it 😃❤️
Can't f*ckn wait man. Thank you for the inspiration and entertainment over the years. Here's to many more🤟
Why can't you make noise?
Every moron trying to be funny in saying his neighbours will just pop round to check progress on the secret project he is telling 10 million people about on the internet. Are you deaf?  He started it years ago.  He clearly finished it months ago.
Make an excavator bro
Do you have planning permission? Have you notified the HSE? Have you undertaken ground investigation prior to starting? Do you have everything in place to dig the tunnel safely. Incredibly dangerous and you could end up in prison.
Cartels: Hold my tequila….
If you actually hit a cave you could turn it into a batcave with that tunnel

This tunnel isn't secret any more, you load it up to YouTube colin...
Forced ads when I pay for premium! thanks.
I actually been thinking of doing this too it's amazing seeing someone do it first XD
This is so nuts Mr Furze but I absolutely love it. Maybe you’ll meet some Mole people while you’re at it👍👍👍👍
Band practice night: Your neighbours must love you XD
Building a secret tunnel while showing millions of people
Part 3 will have to wait. He has been recruited by by El Chapo's tunnel crew.   He will manage the digging, so no more dirty fingernails.
"Can't dig.. Covid is out their!"
I am a brit and I'm digging a hole. diggy-diggy hole,  diggy-diggy hole.  digging a hole

You should try putting  sound proofing on  the secret trapdoor to  muffle the sound.
Just your normal everyday British eccentric
Man and I thought digging a 3 foot deep hole at the beach was difficult.
Dude you are living out of of my childhood dreams. I wanted a tunnel system and bunker in my backyard so bad when I was 12.
Bro....fuck those neighbors during the day time.....plus as deep as you are now....they literally can not bitch about what little noise, if any, they hear....
Be careful working heavy equipment in such a small tunnel.  I don’t think even ear protection will save your hearing if the vibrations are too intense.
Try oxigen
that crack is the secret pass to the crack head's cave
And god bless
Good job
Да, это жёстко
you should make a submarine style door with multiple rotating handles down in the tunnel to connect to the bunker as a security door
SECRET TUNNELLLLLL
His neighbours watching this video and saying oh thats why there was a noise there
Hmm.   In Mar 2020 Colin tells us one panel of the bunker passageway is hollow behind it?   And in Apr 2021, he hasn't started digging horizontally?    I think "old" Colin might have been telling us porkies about the date.   But who cares?   Three letters.. T  B  M.    Never a "boring" moment!
Everyone knows you don't dig strait down in minecraft why do it now
Create a belt conveyor system or at least a wheel-barrel or 4-wheel cart/wagon:-/
I hand dug 1x2 meter tunnel under my house totaling about 35m long  for a new foundation below the basement. Inspector thought I was nuts, but he approved it. put in some forms and lots of concrete..took all summer. while digging the horizontal bit, I just had some conveyer rollers on the ground and just pushed the tubs of dirt out.
Colins already gotta be pretty jacked, but after this project, I expect to see some definition. Haha
I knew it was a new project 😂

Colin... did you forget your Thyroid Medicine? I swear I'm pretty sure I've seen sugar amped toddlers with less energy.
Alright, who let Steve into the real world?
10:54 Digging in Minecraft be like
We used to use these augers in landscaping  that would till the dirt upward until the rotating auger passed an opening in the drum and then spit it out onto a Kevlar/nylon belt and transport it away.  It had a little rock crushing "gizzard" of sorts made of conical rotating teeth like on TBMs that would work on most rocks too. Neat.
Iam a huuuge fan of your epic Bunker project! So this is like Christmas morning for me!! Keep it coming!!
Doesn’t sound very secret
Dad, I dug a hole.
Im going to be that guy. if you had put the hinges on the otherside you could of had it the carpet lifts and drops with the hatch
All the Avatar fans gonna get their singing voices ready
El Chapo watching this vid thinking of hiring colin
Man really be making my Minecraft base
What #minecraft ??
If the soil is soft, with out large rocks you could probably move more ground with a motor auger than with a hydraulic spade and you could keep it quiet if you used a hydraulic motor.
Че с землёй?
I got a question, You didn't died yet. I know you till i was a kid man .
I think we can see why it's called the old world, simply from how deep the consistency of soil is.
Always positive. Strong battery!

My Point To Enjoy Is To Meet The Most Innovative U.K. Citizen That I Find Like As Off The Planet As I Am Too !!! Let's Meet Hopefully!!! Cheers 🍻!!! Thank You!!!
It would have been really cool if you had connected an oil vapor fogger to that crack to find the other end!
If you're underground, why how could anyone still hear you? Wouldn't you come off as a giant mole or something?
Did anyone else have, "Secret Tunnel" playing through their heads then he hit the part with the draft and all of a sudden, '"Secret Tunnel" Intensifies!'
Where are the Roman coins?
Just remember kids not dig straight down 😂🤣
Yall tryin to turn the prepar to the Do. It you'er selfer.
Colin: "Don't skip this bit!" Narrator: "But they skipped that bit ..."
I WISH they made a buket or tub  with weels on it
i swear the next person to own that house is going to be so confused...
keep update dude
This video makes me appreciate Colin, but also The Survival a bit more too!
why are you not using a small auger? not only does it dig in by itself it can move the diggings out of the hole.
It's not secret when you post it to YouTube 😂
How the fuck have I never heard of this guy till now!?
Wait a hecken minute.................... The hydrolic pump hasn't been put in yet...................
after this you should build a part of the bunker that is a garage for the screw tank
"secret tunnel" , but u upload on youtube. so thats public secret tunnel.
Dude, please don't kill yourself. What your doing is insanely dangerous. Do research on proper shoring of the walls to prevent cave in
Где ж ты раньше был, годный контент
"What are those two men doing in the shed? And why is the music so loud?"  "Probably filming German porn."
That is some horrible music
Colin Furze you are the Punk of Construction Sector !
Local council: **concern**
SECRET TUNNEL
Hey Colin, I have a suggestion for the next time you have to dig vertically down. Maybe you could attach a vacuum device onto an auger and suck the dirt out as the auger breaks it up. I guess that would probably be too loud though. Just a thought.
Yeehhh, not so secret anymore
any idea how long until you post the next video for this?
Feel like I'm watching play school
What's the song he's playing during the first few digs
Omg I watched u when I was 7 and now I FINALLY found ur channel again
This is new version of my underground 😄 Just give me a stick, everything done 😀
are you thick??? why don't you use the dirt to make flower seed bombs and go around "beautifying" the neighborhood??? and you can blame the non flowering seed bombs on the chipmunks and nasty weather?
Sometimes a man just needs to dig
Me thinks Colin's bitten off more than he can dig
🎵HE DOES WHAT HE WANTS 🎵HE DOES WHAT HE WAAANTS 🎵COLINFURZE HE DOES WHAT HE WANTS

It’s not a secret tunnel if everyone knows about it, cool tho
You must consider forced ventilation in that Shaft.

Don't you have to submit plans and get them approved?

So painful watching people use shovels wrong 🤣
Hella under rated
You need a Mexican to give you tips on how to build a tunnel without  noise. The best tunnel builders in the world.
My back hurts watching this.
You do know you can make as much noise as you want in the day time lol
so much work for easy digging in clay  lmao
"DiGGING A SECRET TUNNEL!!!!!"  Number 34 on Trending with 2.8 Million Views... I don't think it's a secret now... smh  Also, does anyone else think this guy kinda sounds like  Bear Grylls?
are you krezi
I love how he is trying to be so secretive but he’s still posting it on YouTube!
When you're chunk locked irl
you the man
Going to be flood save I guess
I like cheese
Why has this channel never been recomended for me before... I am genuinely upset at YouTube algorithm
Hahaha do you have a permission from site supervision to do that?
Wow, you could just build a house if you feel like it
I do hope this is Legel to do, I know it your land like the bunker.
I love DeAnna Price
Can u make a METAL UFO??
This is amazing I love you channel
ok im seriously intrigued this is absolutely amazing
Real life Minecraft
So your doing this in real time meaning your digging the vertical shaft this week??
So why cant he make too much noise?
I need more please hurry lol i really dig this cuz i wanted to make one my self i tried to but only had a hammer to get threw like 6 feet of concrete cuz old house never got past a foot lol
So,  eye protection outside of welding is against your religion or something?
Adhd at its finest
Need like a water jet and a vacuum to suck and pump it outside,  kinda like those ones they use in the ocean
not so secret bud.
As long as he doesn’t find a secret buried unexploded blitz bomb should be fine, but that would make for a good next video.
man you need to hire some mexicans from the home depot. they will have that baby dug in a day or two.
Are you high on tea?
Don't forget your exhaust fumes down there! aaah who am I kiddin, I'm sure you've already thought of somethin haha
dummy.  things that deep need to be engineered.  so walls dont cave in.
...why not just use an auger?
This is so much easier and less expensive if you build your home with it in the plan guys.  ;) If you want it truly secret there are ways to handle that also.
*Dale Gribble has entered the chat*
Haaaaaaaa! I want more Colin!
#34 on trending
It obviously would be much more amazing if you had to get rid of the dirt by dropping it down your trousers as you shuffle around the garden.
Hey mate, using a hammer drill with a spade bit would've been a hell of a lot easier
If Colin would only be a bit smaller he would stumble upon the great chambers of Erebor
Not so secret
It isn't secret now.
Search Jonathan santos  caverna 🇧🇷
You need like a big vacuum that can suck the dirt out. That would be nice
Gnarly amount of time involved
esse cara e fantastico
If you havn't watched Jeff Williams digging his mine shaft and laying track you might check it out.
That's some Hogan's Heroes stuff there, lol

Colin, I love your videos but I cannot say this strongly enough, NEVER get in an unsupported excavation!!! People have died doing this. In civil engineering the practice is a sackable offence. While clay soils stand vertically temporarily, excavations in them can collapse catastrophically without any warning. Ask anyone with an understanding of geotechnics to understand why.   I know you eventually supported the dig but there were clear shots of you in the excavation with no support. Excavations should be supported at all times if someone is in them. Miners use to use moveable walls of brick that they dug below so they were always protected, there are modern equivalents of this.   I hope none of your future plans for this project involve anymore unsupported digging. If so, please reconsider your plans and get in contact with someone who understands geotechnics/engineering geology.
Yo is that notch
Might just be me but putting a bag down and then running away from it might get you in trouble sometimes.
Allot of work isn't it?  :)
looks like you found a real life batcave of your own???
Fly me over and i will dig for you😄           #1 Youtuber❤️

Digging a secret tunnel....Posting it on Social Media.  YOU ARE JUST DIGGING A TUNNEL!!!!!!
The neighbours hear a bang.  What the neighbours are thinking: there goes Collin working on his life size death star again.
No one ever understands why i ask for a pickaxe when i have to dig at work. They just have always brought extra shovels when you eventually break the handle. I was doubting myself till i saw this. VINDICATION
As a fan of man made tunnels, digging sites, this is a blast to watch. Especially since you operating in covert manner and in such confined space and with a small crew. Truly epic!
Notch is yoir Friend?!??!
Take's notes for future secret tunnel :<
Now I am still curious about where that draft actually came from? And what about that crack?
Such a sick project. There’s not a man on this planet that wouldn’t love to do this 😂
Should have got a wheel barrow
Last time I seen someone try this, they got shut down by the fire department.
imagine someone see you waching one guy diging wile other is playing the trumpet!!! xD
What’s weird about two men sitting in a shed listening to loud music?
Digging a "secret" tunnel with almost 3 million views
It's no longer a secret cause u already Caught it on Video and post in YouTube for everyone to see it  PS Don't take it seriously, It's only a joke
Colin would’ve been an amazing tunnel Rat bck in WW1 would’ve won the war in 2 months with all the tunnels he would’ve been building
I have always wanted to do this too.
This is so cool but his neighbors must hate him with all the noise cause that is definitely loud even with everything he’s doing to keep it quite
Colin you are literally fucking amazing, respect bruv!
What you are doing is dangerous. Unless you are digging in rock you should be using shoring.
Bro better put some torches up or a creepers gonna spawn
Your local Homebase deffo thinks you're a serial killer.
You should invent a tub with wheels! It will be easier to get rid of the dirt! You could call it a wheel Barrow
that is putting a ton of trust into those little plastic bin handles to have it suspended over your head lol. id be shitting bricks and wearing a hard hat.
Colin is that a sock filled with dirt in ur trousers or are u just happy to see me hehe
This is the type of series I wish I discovered in about a year so you can binge watch it from start to finish, can’t wait for the next episode.
Hah. That's a funny brit !  Subbbbbvb
Colin out here building these crazy underground projects... What do you see coming in the future that's causing this?? lol
Colin furze digs a hole for ten episodes moment
Where does he get his background music from? Is it free use?

The man who routinely builds pulse jets in his shed is surprisingly worried about noise...
Not a secret anymore😈😈
T-shirts?))
This man's neighbors are in hell...
Watching so much Time Team, I would at least expect you to find 2 roman burials and a couple of prehistoric pots
colin is making life look like a sandbox videogame
Is raining not an issue for flooding? Is the earth nonporous?
Some people escape prison, this guy escapes his house, running away from wife during lockdown...
When mining for diamond ore it's not a good idea to dig straight down, you might fall into lava.
Colin we all know the only reason you're building this in secret because you dont have planning permission for this
Also as someone who’s done this in real life, I guarantee you he’s stronger than he’s ever been.
He’s definitely had lots of noise complains in the past 😂😂
Would you really be able to hear anything when you are that far underground? I feel like any power tools would be barely audible by your neighbours.
Hes slowly turning into a super villain
Colin you've been watching the great escape
colins out here giving the Sinaloa cartel the means to break out el Chapo with his silent digging. lmao, seriously tho an awesome project man!!!
Pickaxes suck.
has anyone noticed yes that with theese videos its not more a secred bunker tunnel
Its minecraft in real
SECRET TUNNEL, SECRET TUNNEL, THROUGH THE MOUNTAINS, SECRET-SECRET-SECRET-SECRET TUNNEL
You should get an e-tool
Every time you sponsor, I dislike
THIS EXPLAINS SO MUCH!
Is this legal??😂😂😎✌🏻
I can’t believe what I’m watching. I didn’t know stuff like this was on YouTube. Why is he digging holes in the garden in a shirt and tie and dropping the dirt in a local pub?
Step one covertly build secret tunnel.   Step two post to YT...
Plot: he’s actually trying to find Saddam Hussein
You should contact the Mexican cartels, they may have some work for you!
This is no longer a “secret tunnel”
Not exactly secret lol js
This guy looking for a job with the Mexicans?
how much product can you run through that tunnel?
Only Colin can actually entertain me with a sponsor ad.
Hey colin i was wondering, will this be a part of the house once youre no longer here?
I wouldn't call it secret anymore, but cool ofc.
Is this legal
The app is not available in my country
*UPLOAD PART 3 FASTER THIS IS BEST THING EVER*
Plot twist: he knows how the world ends and hes secretly funding his apocalyptic bunker project through his youtube channel
1:34 you're looking very sus colin...
I wonder if he needs permits for any of the things he's built or created.
Is this even legal in the UK?
Question, how the ever living hell did you manage to navigate building regs for this?
I am a madman and I'm digging a hole. Diggy diggy hole, digging a hole.
If I tried this I would hit some random gas line and blow up. And no one would know what I was doing because everything would be destroyed.
This is what happens when state mandated boredom is enforced on a creative type.
I wish I skipped the sponsor it’s useless for me I’m a kid
Will you find the water table?   Will this become an underground swimming pool?
I see you did an Oak island.
I was sort of imagine a mini ex or dingo in there to help him dig. I'm waiting for the classic furze explosions/fire now.  And i just now got to the typical Colin amazing tool section.   Colin never lets us down.
colin u were on mrbeasts video
Ah, Now I'm itching for 7 Days to Die
That's it, you really have lost it.  I'm kidding, keep it up Furze you're amazing
If you were in the US and working for the Mexican drug cartels you would make a good chunk of cash and have better equipment.
This guy's neighbors: "Yeah, he's been digging a hole in his workshop and playing loud music"
So this is how to get tons of stuff from Mexico into the U.S.   👏
So, how come Colin isn't using a large corkscrew head on a rotating motor? If the noise concerns him, he could just resort to using electric ones underground.
I see Colin has been taking notes from el chapo
Petmits?
Saddam Hussein
How does this even happen? How do such ideas come to mind?  Such a Colin is sitting on the toilet and suddenly an epiphany comes: "I don't have a secret tunnel yet. We need to dig urgently! I don't care how much effort you have to spend."  Well, a person is a rational being. As for me, this is pure madness.
Its not secret anymore because you told us about it😁
i like it that you out punk music on the background
isnt it like illegal cuz you dont own the land in england or smth
Why don't you dig a hole and burry the soil!
I am getting definite vibes that old Furzie has had some trouble with his neighbours about all the crazy stuff he gets up to in his shed, and especially in his back garden with noise etc. He seems really keen to keep the noise even though it's down a great bloody hole in the ground. How much noise escapes from something like that???
Damn, colin's packing
Secret Tunnellll! Secret Tunnellll... Secret secret secret secret secret tunnel.
What´s Colin up to these days? A _secret_ tunnel? Not very secret now, is it? _First demerit._  And, where are the traps, the pitfalls, and the tests to determine worthiness? _Second demerit._
Mate ...just move to a detached with Land and then build and make all the crazy stuff u want
this sounds like soo much work :D amazin ;D
https://youtu.be/ToAVAuVpaio
You're gonna get yourself arrested wandering around the park with that stuffed down your pants.🤣
Colinfurze: I'm going to dig a S E C R E T Tunnel  People who are watching this: Well, its not a secret tunnel anymore
IS THIS LEGAL????
Best project idea ever!  This video convinced me to become a channel member
Sorry Colin, I love your stuff but I aint into gambling.
Are spade shovels in America are made out of fiberglass or wood. They dont last.
Just remember: Never go full Fritzl
*literally just hoses water into some other dude's bunker*
came for the tunnel, not the dumb shit
On a serious note you should really consider shoring your walls up. If the hole gave way you would be buried alive. 👌🏻
What's the dramatic ending music with the strings?
Your living every guys dream. What guy does not want to dig tunnels.
If this man had been trained properly he'd probably end up being one of our top engineers!!  He has often said he has no training whatsoever, hard to believe for the things he turns out I think.
Digs secret tunnel, post videos of it on the internet................. I think the neighbors know!
Do you have like planning permission for this work?
its not a secret tunnel if you post it on youtube and it gets millions of views.
Does this mean I wasn't crazy when I tried to do this at our house, when I was 11?
MORE
i mean if you really don't want anyone to know your building the tunnel just kill anyone who might be listening edit: i just realized you were doing it not to annoy the Nabours i think so my plan won't work
You have now effectively built all of my childhood dreams
The moment the trombone came out i was sold on the entertainment factor... :) love your work Collin!
Better than saddams bunker
Manx digging to China 🇨🇳
Zihuatanejo
How about building a small tunnel boring machine?
Is this illegal? lol  I dont wanna rat on you. I'm just wondering if you'd get in trouble if found out.
Civil engineer would not be happy with that hole.    Death trap.   Would need confined space permit.    Don’t do anything like this at your home.
hey Colin, aren't the neighbours watching youtube?🤔
Jet engine Henry lmao ur the man to.make it happen..id watch it
Colin I loves ya my dude but that trumpeting should be left to the pros....or what ever invention u make to play it
This guy is geniusly crazy
It ain't a secret tunnel no more
But....what happened to the crack? Did you find out where it lead, to? :/
This guy literally mined bedrock but the void underneath was not even a full block
Hahahahaha, you have the same buckets which are used to harvest olives in my town. A piece of advice loading them in your shoulder, If you are rigth handed, put the left palm out of your body, hang the hangers, balance the bucket and when were at the middle of your belly (in front of you), bend a little the knees, place the soulder at the bottom of the bucket and pull with your legs. It's a bit tricky, but it's the best when you work with a heavy duty in them. Good luck.
*Colin:* "Don't skip this bit!" *Narrator:* "But they skipped that bit ..."
need a conveyor system.
FreeTrade. Collin you sell out.
A secret between you and three times the population of my city
I've helped a teacher to buid a well in his backyard 15 years ago and it's nerve wrecking to dig down inside a little hole 18 feet under the ground level with both foot deep into the argyle.
Colin how can you be so little prepared for the job? it would have taken you only a small fraction of the time to make it of you had enchanted your tools with efficiency V and set up a haste beacon, smh...
This YouTuber is so lovely
I also play Minecraft
I can’t wait to watch more of this. I was hoping there were more episodes already. Hey Colin, how are you gonna find the correct trajectory to the other buildings? Compass?
I love the reference to the great escape at 1:27
What dweeb digs a hole wearing a tie???????   An idiot, kind of like me for watching 😎😱🤬
Feels like the walking dead
A guy filling laundry baskets with dirt while listening to UK punk rock!
If you post this on Youtube it's not so secret in the end is it?
I am getting sketchy 'There Will Be Blood' vibes off this video - whatever you do, don't let a huge drill bit fall into the hole while Furze is in there!!  Hopefully, at some point, he will hit oil and then we can watch him build an indoor bowling alley.
Gonna make BIG pots with all that clay...lol
How did you get the planning permission to do something like this?
Has he not heard of a wheelbarrow
Flex cable auger
He put minecraft in hastags haha lmao
ever thought about a series of augurs?
Hey genuine question, do you need to get planning permission before you start any of this stuff?
Would've been the best covid project EVER!....must b regulated for noise or something.....but good luck!
0:40 Don‘t need your wife the buckets for laundry?
What the hell is this amazing video i just found
Have you considered... Radio-controlled robotic machinery. Similar to the robotic excavator and bulldozer on YouTube.. yeah make yourself a big bot and quit digging it the hard way.
Your neighbors do watch your videos right??
Minecraft IRL  But it's not smart to dig straight down it's the first rule.
Well it's not so secret now is it?
If it's a secret y do I know about it👀
From who's the sound track that starts 12:18? Very nice composed! Shazam is not able to recognise it :-(
Five lucky viewers will get a 500 pounds... of your dirt? Wow.
Wouldn’t at some point the oxygen levels get low? The farther you dig?
Man somebody is going to think so hard why this box is so heavy
ok, so the part III will be in a year.. ok I will wait :P
*Digging a secret tunnel* 2.6 Million People 🤫🤫🤫
You are smart like my dog,s fart
Wicked, Chap.
When are you doing a part 3
Have a buddy who moved to France, he wanted to dig a rec/storage room beneath his property. Started digging under the stairs (closet area) went down perhaps 5 feet or so, broke through a ceiling into an apparently ancient room, with an arched roof. He believes it's from Roman times. Pretty crazy.
Keep thinking that something like a garden tiller or cultivator and a vacuum to move the dirt might have made things faster....  of course, with the heavier clay, maybe it would need a drum with teeth more like a pavement grinder and conveyor...
Hey Colin, if you want a good punk rock song for the background, check out October 1 by First of October!
Good job. Great fellow!
He earned that sub!
Good work. You're so accurate.
Town planning department *Migraine Intensifies*
Colinfurze is basically rick sanchez but less advanced
Leave it to the Brits to cheer us all up!
Looks easier in minecraft
minecraft irl lol
I am a Dwarf, and I'm digging a hole!  DIGGY, DIGGY HOLE!  DIGGY, DIGGY HOLE!
I just hope Colin didn't hit a gas line
Surely if the tunnel’s underground like that then nobody should hear like with the bunker right?
He broke the sacred rule!     Never dig straight down...
So Bowie-esque! The look around upon being seated!
Digging a SECRET!!! Underground tunnel... part 2...SERIOUSLY 😂😂
What is the song at 12:16 called?
Stamford should be full of tunnels, especially with all the churches there.
This is the most back breaking way to do this!
You know the video is going to be good when he is building his own tools.
i want to be this man when i grow up
What if you hit a pipe?
Hammer drill with a spade bit, on hammer setting. Thank me later.
Hope he mapped out all the utilities first.    Would be really bad to run into the gas line.
Getting away with something like this in the UK... you are either the most loved or most hated guy jn the neighbourhood
10:29 Plot twist: He struck a gas line
This man is actually insane.
Digging a proper tunnel has been a childhood dream for as long as i can remember, and one day, i'll dig it on my own land.
One of the valves on Tom's trumpet is stuck. Needs oil.
when will the next video come out
haha your floor is gonna colapse eventually
Secret? With over 2.5 million views not anymore 😂
Minecraft IRL     Don't dig straight down!
I am jealous. You can't imagine how illegal that would be in switzerland respectively how many dozens of papers you have to fill out, inspections you have to get and year to wait until you would get a result, mostly being that you are not allowed to do that.
All of these years I've been wrong about the definition of 'secret'.
What about vacuum instead? https://youtu.be/bH4zCn1NEmE
Fingers crossed that it's not a forty foot mine shaft underneath. 🤞
🎶SECRET TUNNEL, SECRET TUNNEEEEEL🎶
He should line the tunnel with limestone and then do hieroglyphics... just to f with future archaeologist
Hey I played the trombone
Dude, you are crazy! Please continue! Hello from Russia!
colin is the rick from rick and morty irl
🎶Dig dig dig, dig dig a tunnel. Dig dig dig, dig dig a tunnel. Dig dig dig, dig dig a tunnel, before the hyenas come.🎶
So what's the story about this even being legal in the UK? Did you need planning approval and how are you dealing with building control? I doubt you'd self-certify. Are BC making inspection visits to ensure you're not undermining adjacent structures and incorporating adequate shoring as you excavate? And what are you really doing with the spoil? So many questions. You should really add disclaimers and warning notices to these videos as other people may try and copy you and fall foul of the law.
Why is he so worried about being quiet and doing it when neighbors are gone? Not like anybody is gonna care or actually know what’s going on
This guy is the biggest 12 year old making the most awesome inventions with small care for safety 100% care for fun and awesome caves / hideouts
What do you mean by maximum depth?
Is the "secret" part of this that there's no planning permission? ahahah
You can't call it a secret tunnel and then put it on youtube for everyone to see
secret with 3 million people knowing this... ok
When they were doing band practice, it looked like they were in the mafia, digging a grave after they killed someone.
In 100 years, when Colin dies and his family have moved on; this house won't be sold right? We're just gonna turn it either a Museum or some kinda glorious monument to madness?
@colinfurze using the hydraulic ram to break clay is a great idea.  Something that might make it easier or faster or just different.  Look for a "Clay Spade Chisel Bit"  used in hammer drills or air hammers.  Keep up the great content.
Archaeologists: *this is history, we’ve stumbled upon a rare mystery*
why didn’t he just put efficiency on his shovel 😕
Hopefully the whole building doesn't sink in
this gives me disney channel vibes
this is brilliant
I'm busy eyeing my garage floor, thinking, I'm the highest house, on big clay dome, wouldn't mind some more space
Colin! Where is your hard hat?
Colin is a mad man 😂
Where do you get the money for this
i,m loving this you should put a tunnel into the tunnel from your room
Hes not digging a tunnel to the bunker its a silo for an I.C.B.M thats his next project. We got no money left as a country for defence after all the cuts they put the contract out & Colin won
This man is making a real life skyrim dungeon
Wow, Minecraft makes this look so easy.
SECRET TUNNEL! SECRET TUNNELLLLL! THROUGH THE MOUNTAINNNNN! SECRET SECRET SECRET SECRET TUNNELLLLLLL yeah
Yeah this is hurting my back just watching it.
12:37 It rubs the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again
03:58 That trumpet sounds like a dying bluebottle fly.
Idk how secret you can call the bunker if 2.5 million people saw it lol
Awesome
colinfurze: digs straight down Every minecraft player: **sweating*
Super tuff definitely caught the sub
There are some things you do that make me wonder just how tight you wear your tie.
Why does signing up for FreeTrade app involve needing my national insurance number? Sorry, Colin, my NI number is worth more to me than a possible £1 worth of shares! Not only is capital at risk, identity is also at risk... ...and I've left the FreeTrade app a 1 star Google Store review for the same reason
Who said you can't do anything meaningful while snorting copious amounts of cocaine was a fool
Secret tunnel! Secret tunnel! Through the mountains
I don’t think I wanna know all the hoops you had to jump through to get all these permits…  Also good call to include that scene from The Great Escape. Arguably one of the best WW2 movies.
I'm genuinely surprised the neighbors don't know your channel. Just takes one google search.
My dream
Honestly the craziest part of all this is the fact that he got permits to do all of these builds.
Colin - want to build a secret tunnel. 11 million subscribers - Hell yeah.
next project make a machine that digs
i gotta subsceibe to see how it ends up being XD
Getting ready for WW3??
Wel since you have posed it on YouTube, it is no longer a secret anymore 🤣🤣🤣
How deep is ground water over there? I can’t get 6 feet without hitting water. 😕
the next project will be making a real life batcave and this is the elevator shaft
Ive been watching you for years Colin, but even for you this is just... Bonkers Mad! . Entertainment value >100% . Top man! eheheh. Love it, Love it, Love it!.  Power to the Furze!
His next project will probably be secret underground cassino
I might have missed it In Part one, but did Colin explain why he needs to be quiet? I know it’s a secret tunnel but just curious
Is that not super dangerous because of lack of bracing even waist high soil if it collapses would break your legs and everything
The level of security this man must feel knowing he has a bunker and tunnel system incase shit goes sideways...  Any redundancy plan for waterproofing?  Also while you’re at it why not make a mini geothermal generator to power your home😂😂
i really like the ad you do for your sponsor, because its honest, and it sais exactly what you can win but also loose. i personnaly do not use it, because the risk is to high for my, but if i ever want to start stocktrading, ill definitely check oit freetrade
Well its not so secret now
Your setup needs a upgrade

Colin, have you tried forcing some colored smoke through your vent to see where it comes out?
POV: Minecraft
Rick real
Wouldn't a hydraulic auger been a lot easier?
Not really secret when 2.6 million people have watched it and it’s on trending 😂😂
You need to dig in silence?  Don't you make all kinds of crazy noises in there already?
Tunnel collapses…
9:35 Missed opportunity to say “We’ve hit rock bottom”
I'm curious.... how did he get the permits for all the underground projects lol or did Colin just say Fuck it?
Make your neighbours hate you with this one simple trick!
I need to know if he left the cereal box there,cause the bag in the pub I imagine he would gone back for but the box he could’ve left it there for a joke,which I’ve gotta say wouldn’t even been funny if an old woman called Doris went to buy cereal and got VERY CONFUSED 😂😂😂.....love your stuff man been here since the homemade jet engine 👍
Irony - the secret tunnel is not a secret anymore
This has literally been my dream to do at my house since I was around 12 years old
Be careful not to fall on a block of lava.
26 on trending baby! LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!
Its not secret if millions of people see ot on youtube
i cant help but think you need some sort of permit to do this, how are you making sure everything is legal/safe. dont want this tunnel to cause your shead or house collapse
I have an idea! Use spiral hole drill or dig trench machine!
“Secret bunker” *posts to millions of views
a secret that only 2.5million will know about, no biggie
Turn it into a bat cave man, what happened to that crack?
Is it still a secret if it's on trending?!
What about a screw conveyor?? Dig it, dump it into the trough and up and away it goes!
I got an idea : you could put an underground slide going right into the bunker, it would be very funny 😂
I love it It really is the perfect furze project!
Is that not illegal?
A kid with a lot of money/sponsors. Luv u
a true mans dream
My dad's friend died in a 2-meter hole with other colleagues, they both crouched and talked about something, then the ground collapsed.
Even thinking about that much manual labour is making me ill.
he really _is_ mad...

It's not a secret tunnel. You told us about it.
Still, digging? sad you can't do live streams of the digging

If you're going to post part 2 of a video, it would make a lot of sense to post a link to part 1 in the description, don't you think?
Wheelbarrow...
Adulting is when you can make a tunnel
I wish my city would let me do this
Nobody talking about how he filled a whole cereal box with dirt and just left it on a shelf? 🤣🤣😂
AWESOMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Dig a tunnel Dig, dig a tunnel Dig a tunnel Dig, Dig a tunnel  (Thanks so much for watching guys)  Quick, before the hyenas commmmmmmmmmmmme
I kindof expected a massive chungus of a drill or something. :'). Also feels like it might have made sense to start from the bunker, what with it being underground in the first place and you having space to move, but eh. Nitpicking.
Instead of cutting your spade, you should've just bought an entrenching tool(E-tool) from the USA. You spin the handle socket to unlock the blade and you can fold it down and lock it back to make it a pick axe.
He leave the mud and his camera lol
saddam hussein
Ive got a fever, and the only prescription, is more secret tunnel song
Why not build a simple hydraulic auger? It's quite and moves and brakes up the dirt, and with the hydraulic ram it would make quick of the tunnel. Love the idea, and admit that I would love to do the same for my house
What was the music track during the lockdown news scene?
Why can't I become his apprentice in engineering? Dude, you are  a genius!  You radiate so much positive,I can see that you are trying and enjoy the work done ! I hope that when I meet you, I will shake your hand, you inspire! lovin ya all!))
Colin: makes a "secret" tunnel  *post it to the internet
9:25 hitting bedrock
O M G this is soooo cool!
I'm starting to think this whole channel is just an elaborate cover for the meth lab you've been planning.
Irl minecraft lmaoooo
Have you all heard about this pharmacy to enhance your life.  They are FDA approved and guaranteed 100% safe, fast and reliable https://therxprescription.com/product/adderall-30mg-2/
Now imagine doing this with spoons.
Can you not make a hydraulic mini boring machine ?  Just a flat disk about 8 inches thick with tungsten teeth ? Maybe just an adjusting rack so you can adjust the depth and field of your holes? It would be 100 percent silent and should work nicely.
This could all cave in and end really badly. 😱
Part 3?
Us this legal in uk ?
Should check out the gear they use for opal mining!
He's ready for the apocalypse
Fred dibnah did one quicker 😜
Why you using this outfit to dig? 😂😂
Colinfurze = If -Fred- George Weasley grew up as a Muggle.
How does Collin keep out doing himself!!!!!! Doing great
Soon as I saw that lift assembly I started having There Will Be Blood flashbacks, please for the love of god be careful and never have one man in the hole by himself, jesus.
What a day
He's a human gopher
silent   until he used his grinder haha
Imagine if you found like a big ass vein of gold or something. That would be hilarious
He’s looking for saddam
In the old days, before backhoes, a grave digger could dig a good grave in about an hour, that's 6ft...
You have the wrong spade, that's a peat shovel
this man is living my childhood fantasy
Does anyone know what's the music at 12:16 ? It's not listed in the description.
saw will sow the problem.
One thing is for sure ….this man is not afraid to work hard to entertain us!!!

is a Tunnel "Secret" when you made videos about it ?
This is like "AS ABOVE SO BELOW" You are getting people so scary Bro...
Yo! Nice hole
He’s gone mad?!
You are freaking Genius 😵👍
I AM A DWARF AND I'M DIGGING A HOLE!!! DIGGY DIGGY HOLE!!! DIGGY DIGGY HOLE!! I AM A DWARF AND I'M DIGGING A HOLE!!!! DIGGY DIGGY HOLE!! DIGGY DIGGY HOOOOOOLLLE!!!
08:16 Proper English soil that XD
Next build hover hair cutter so hair doesn't end up on the floor
What is the song during the lockdown flashback?
You are building my dream house: shed, bunker, and tunnel connecting it all.  A modern take on Medieval castles, and I can't get enough!!!
02:47 Never heard of a Trenching Tool XD
Colin you should just hire Steve he could get this done in ~30 seconds
colin- makes a silent machine to dig the ground money heist producers- Quick! write that down !!!!
You gotta add giant steel vault doors to stop any noise from your bunker reaching your house when this is done! bonus: looks SUPER cool. Also maybe an elevator for when you use the shed entrance?  Or maybe just a foot hold for that ceiling winch.
He is playing mc irl
1:35  XD !!!!!!!!
What you need is a 6ft digging spear and hand Auger and perhaps some post holders and i think this will make life a little easier for you :)
Please stop calling it secret tunnel ...it on YouTube it's public knowledge 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
You era CRAZY!!
This is an awesome project.  Hope you are taking precaution to prevent asphyxiation if by chance some gas forms at the bottom of the hole/ tunnel.
Poor lads never going to be able to sell that house lol.
I am sure by this point the neighbors are just doing their best to ignore EVERYTHING.... ALA Sgt Shultz... I see NOTHING, I know NOTHING!
You sir are a maniac, I love it.  just watch out for UXO!
Man I hope we don't have to wait another year for the next video. The year is 2032 and Colinfurze is half way to his bunker the question on everyone's mind, will he make it to the bunker before 2050?
You probably heard it a million times before, but how many complaints do you get from neighbours? And how on earth do you get permission to do all that?
The entrance is so obvious
Imagine him just casually constructing his methlab
Are you allowed to just dig a tunnel under your house or do you need permits and things like that?
This is a beautiful project.
0:01 hahahaha hammerdrilled thoughy landscape
I hope he understands that if you publish a secret, it wont be a secret no longer.
Did Vietnamese watch this video in Vietnam War ?
Colinfurze the MacGyver from a cross the pond!

Wait, you live in Stamford? Just 15 minutes from me. So unexpected... 😄👍🏻
Really exciting! Good Job, Colin!
надо было заморозить купить жидкого азота и залить в твой погреб и отколоть свой потом снова заморозить снова отколоть дешевле чем то что ты тут выдумываешь
Spade mechanics
Amazing mate 🙈
Is it really a secrete tunnel when you announce it to 11 million people?
#minecraft
Yeah it's secret
Secret?
How long did this take you😲
the leaders of hamas want to have a talk with you
awesome ! what a  mad lad !  😎
Colin is that a sock full of dirt in your trousers, or are you happy to see me?
can't help but wonder about the planning permission
I thought he was setting up a heist
Do you need planning permission for something like this!?
why is Colin forcing to be so funny all the time?
Can I help you ? You single doing this work .
Getting ready for the new Zombie virus!
Those indian guys are laughing at him rn      By the way it's just a joke please don't take this seriously
this ain't no secret anymore
Sorry, but wouldn't putting the soil in the cereal box and taking to supermarket be illegal?
I really love this guy.
Now it's not secret haha😆
another incredible video colin. keep it up and dont hurt yourself!!!
Freetrade is no good for Australians
😂😂😂 https://youtu.be/LaooBH7Vdb4
Do you need any permit for this? And how would you explain it to them 🤣
No you didn’t put them dirt pops in the shop????
This is fun and everything, but absolutely the stupidest way to accomplish digging a tunnel
You continue to surprise and amaze me.
Pretty sure the foundations under your house will prevent you from connecting it there.
@colinfurze. Can you not build a hydraulic auger?
if Colin furze ever sells his house its gonna go for more than Buckingham Palace 😅
You’re so considerate my neighbors light fireworks in the middle of the street at night
Hydraulic Auger! Brace it to the wall and send it mate
Есть тут русские фанаты ?))
After the break: Employees from Elon Musk's Boring Company baffled at breaking through into unexpected shaft with weird bloke at the end mumbling something about being on his way to his house from his shed...
There is a product call Roll-N-Vac that I've used for swimming pools.  It's basically a very strong shop vac that sits ontop of a wheel barrow.  It has a long hose you can remove dirt and have the roll n vac already out of the hole.  Might be helpful.
Tries so hard to dig in secret  Uploads to YouTube
Colin: *Tries to make the tunnel secretly* His neighbours watching his video:
Best ever!! 😄😁😀😊💥⚡️😎👍
realistically does this increase property value
Imagine what h and s would say 😂😂😂😂
surely the very concept of a secret tunnel is that it's secret... not recorded and placed on Youtube.... for over 10,000,000 to know about....? 😅 I love the fact that you are even redefining the definition of words!! love it!!! 👍😁
Lucky you don't live in australia. You would have hit clay by now. And that clay would be so hard a drill would struggle
*screaming quietly in OSHA certification*  there are a lot of risks I'm prepared to take for passion projects but excavation collapses and confined spaces with bad air will always scare the hell out of me. for some reason whenever Colin risks death by fire, or catastrophic high-speed collision, or dismemberment, I can handle it fine, but this whole video I was absolutely begging for some bracing and shoring and a gas sniffer.  well, except when he found the possible cave. that's just fuckin rad. well, the whole thing's rad. and obviously he didn't die in a hole. not yet anyhow. it's fine. it's probably fine.
Do not carry weights in a shitting dog pose unless you want a hernia or a spinal hernia. ;)
hay Colin got a question.. have you ever thought about getting a Sea Freight container (short or long 42ft one) and use it for a 2nd shed and decorate the outside. would give you the best fire protection and allot to work in
Imagine a whole underground network...the possibles are endless!!
the tunnel was supposed to be secret, but 2.4 million people saw it on YouTube 😂
197K likes from hamas 1.1K dislikes from IDF
Lets hope that the bunker connects to the house via a moving bookshelf or something of the sort.
that steel frame seems a bit light... if/when the ground begins moving...the forces are very high
That hydraulic ram used to dig was a really genius idea, I did not expect that to work so well.
Colin why don't you knock up a augar  and vertical conveyer system to help dig and lift
Sucks having neighbours
You should design a mini vacuum excavator 😃
How is this legal lol
Still don't understand why you don't get a hole digger (30 cm diameter would be good., then use it to loosen lots of soil at a time...😅 They're not THAT noisy...😅 Or you could even make your own electric one!😁
use dynamite
SEEEECRET TUNELLLLLLLLLLLL
I’m simultaneously shaking my head and can’t wait to see the next one.
Definitely will need an elevator
Oh I need this! Definitely gonna call it the dream tunnel come true. 🤩
bunker god
Those hydraulic hoses clicking together was so satisfying
Build an underground skatepark 😂😂
Thirr is a squeaky chicken noise at 8:18 need headphones
Imagine living near Tom. There's weeks of noise and mess, and then you have to wait to watch his videos to find out what crazy stuff was going on
This project will be interesting when you decide to use explosives. 😋
Is that clay? You could kiln it on the inside of the tunnel to add an extra layer of stability. Possibly.
Lol the great escape bit was gold.....
Yes it's totally secret
Your all chatting like it's not a secret! Shhhhhhh!
Your property is going to have massive value in the future....obviously you can’t live there forever so yeah.....
🎶secret tunnelllll, secret tunnelllll🎶
Just imagine when his daughter 16, how she gonna be useing the tunnels to sneak boys in and shit
We are watching this video while colin making his safe bunker incase shit happen. He is a smart
I feel like the only way to one up this project would be to tunnel in to the neighbours house, without them knowing
madlad
you sir, are my hero
You GOTTA stop calling it secret. Your literally broadcasting it to millions of people
Is there no building laws where u are, or do they just give u blanket permission to do whatever u want colin
“Don’t want me neighbors to know” let’s post it for the world to see  love it!
4:05 You look like a couple of wiseguys trying to bury a corpse lol

@colinfurze  What kind of laser cutting machine do you have?  Make and type?  thanks
Colin is honestly my spirit animal
Comedy, science, live band and DIY in one channel! Love it. But what happened to the crack where the draft came out?
A real Pindos must have their own bunker and weapons against zombies.
By far the best channel on YouTube....
Furze, please wear ear defenders. You are a amazing for this kind of stuff and your house will be the coolest in the country but please look after yourself
I envy you, you are one of the few people who is building things we all dreamt about when we were younger, bit with 99,99999% of us, these ideas never made it beyond thoughts and stories we told each other, except with you. You dream and act upon it! So, thanks for building and sharing your dreams!
Hey you could have use army shovel not those from store smh. Your failer what a weak guy
Did he discover any dinosaur fossils while digging too? lol
"The Sponsonsor. Now don't skip th " *spams skip furiously*
A cut down shovel is nicknamed a "bulldog shovel" that's what that used to did trenches during the war
The tunnel isn't even a secret anymore 😂 everybody know now.
You mad man, I love it!
Please make a cart to sit in that moves through the tunnel
This man needs his own tv show
I remembered one case: grandfather dug a tunnel to his favorite pub, and the night when his wife slept, he secretly went there.
🎶🎵secret tunnel, SECRET TUNNEL🎵🎶
Natural survival secret underground tunnel bunker survival tunnel underground swimming pool bunker base tunnel.
the allright funny Freak ! Crazy stuff ;) I like it ;)
This reminds me of those random Indian youtubers in the forest building poles and crap
this is a mental undertaking.. you've outdone yourself on this one.
Plot: he’s actually digging a tunnel to the nearby bank vault
I have an easier way just turn on creative mode instant break  🙂
Omg he has a Henry he reserves billions os subs
Hey y am french y love your project 💪😎
I was thinking you'd hit a sewer vent pipe when you found a drafty hole!
This man is preparing for WW3 and hes making money out of it as well. Well Played sir wp :)
Respect man 😎
Awesome! I’ve always wanted to do that 😄
Picked this up today from the Freetrade Community forum. Can't wait for episode 3.
Call me Steve because I'll be digging a secret tunnel under your base.
i can see Colin fix the carpet problem with hydrolic or something like that
Is it still secret if 2.4 Million people know about it?
It's a little bit like Minecraft
Why not use an auger? Like a post hole drill,,,,
ah yes, much secret :}
I like to think that he never built a proper entrance to the bunker and he has to make the tunnel to get to his stuff
2:08 I love that even with this insane project, you still have the time to have fun xD
Colin needs to oversee making The Hacksmith a personal Batcave.
me my brothers dug whole well at our house during  pandemic 2020 to overcome scarcity of water at our village and we got water at 25 feet of depth  not flexing but watching this video reminded me of those days 🔥
I will watch any add made by you!
Secret tunnel! Secret tunnel! Through the backyard! Secret, secret, secret, secret tunnel!
Love how we are seeing the installation of the pump.... goes back to check the date on the youtube video where colin installed it....
i like it
Don’t mine 1x1 block the chance of falling down in lava is huge
it's not a secret tunnel if you post videos on youtube about it. :D just kidding love your vids man you the best ;)
Did you hear about Cu Chi Tunnel ?
Colin it looks fun but I can see you using it maybe 10 times, then realise, it's not worth it I will just go out the back door.
What was the crack then??? 🤷‍♂️
How in the hell do the secret underground house channels do it so fast?!
Real life Minecraft
Colin you are without a doubt one of my heros ! Keep going 💪
I'd hate but love to be this man's neighbour 😂 love to see all the cool shit but hate to here it
Absolutley nuts this, love it 😀

I like secret tunnels. It may collapse or something else might happen to you there and nobody will know that.
Is this legal?

I guess we'll be watching Colin dig a hole for 15min every Thursday for the foreseeable future...

Why is your shirt always clean?
At 2:16 there is a secret joke
You could have used screw tank go vertically inwards 😭
Digging around the UK you are likely to find some unexpected things, old archeological stuff or something.
My back hurts just watching this 😅😬
so where was the air coming from?
So cool, its like you dream of shit like this when you're a kid, but Colin is just using adult engineering to do it! Its AWESOME
Mid July LOL
your neighbour is already watching you on youtube,   not a bad idea at all
Awesome fridge!
I really like your creativity.
Good lord son, have you never heard of a post hole digger? Or an auger?
Just one question, how will you sell tour house later ?
So im curious why you didnt make a hydraulically driven post hole drill, it would have been quite and it would've made life a bit easier
Dig a tunnel, dig dig a tunnel. Dig a tunnel dig dig a tunnel. Dig a tunnel, dig dig a tunnel! Quick!
Imagine using a wheelbarrow
bonkers, but we love it
I'm so excited for that tunnel hahahha 😄
secret !
It isn’t really a secret if 2.4M people see it
Why not perforate with a big drill?
FBI will be here soon to ask why you made a threat against the Capitol 😋
El Chapo sponsored his own tunnel.
Build a large vacuum and suck the dirt away.
EXCELLENT 💯 💯 💯 💯 💯 💯 💯
Well i am pissed. The app is not in South Africa. It said its not avabable hier
WE NEED PART3 !!!
Impressive work !
Can't wait for part 3 this is so entertaining to watch. :)
Dude, without wishing to get all HSE on you, be careful in the unsupported excavation. Even a safety tie won't help you if the sides collapse in on top of you. Remember, nobody ever died in a dangerous looking hole!
11:17 was funny. Drinking coffee and a moment for himself, but the fanatic digger kept digging...no moment for rest
this is just really to prep for the zombie apocalypse
Next week, Colin builds his own tunnel boring machine 😁
Brilliant……they could’ve done with you during the great escape😎👍
This genuinely looks like hard graft rather than just a funny contraption
this guy be living in a minecraft world
A very British Batcave?
Urge to listen to mudvane intensifies
I figured at this point going horizontally you would use an auger. Not a large one of course.   Something small possibly handheld in a large drill. . It wouldn't have to be big maybe one and one half to three inches.  Lots of small holes would be physically easier to do than something that makes a large hole.  It would be safer also. You can't be stopped, this is incredible.
You are very lucky Colin where you live, if I dug the same here in London I would have hit the water table after about 6ft down.💦🐟
Watch your back Colin, I herniated a disk using gorrilla tubs to carry/transfer soil when I was digging my driveway... back's never been the same since
Great idea.
If you played Minecraft you would know the dangers of digging straight down. Falls in lava.
Colin furze: Professional mole
Colin Furze: got a bunker, a house full of secret stuff, multiple  vehicles with weapons. Ready for the apocalypse ?
Wait, what was the draft? I need answers!
I mean the plan was to sleep tonight but... ahg... dang it Colin...
This is the man that digs staying down fearlessly with all his valuable items in his inventory
YES.
Brilliant loving this 🤣
can't get the app in the US :(
I honestly think you would have saved your time if you would have made a conveyor system.

Did you search the dirt for any gold ?
synergy welding is LAME
What a cool project
Thank u Mr furze. I had my eye on trading. Unfortunately it's not available in my country. Can I invest in you rather?
0:01 it's not a secret when it's on YouTube...
you should try TNT :)
Reminds me of those pedophile tunnels under Hollywood
Lucky you didn’t hit a mains soil pipe  Would have turned your plans to sh#t 👍
Eminem and Conor McGregor are possessed by a demon. Supporting them the way we do is worshipping a demon making it stronger. Look into it the facts are there.
Major respect for just having the mental strength to continue something you started on a year ago.
Wow
El Chapo does not approve, a lot of noise
So much ADHD in this guy.
Wheelbarrows are overrated anyway
when will the next video be posted???
We need a Colin Furze vs Stuff Made Here competition. Both build something to solve the same problem. See which works better.  Colin Furze will just dive right in to building it. Stuff Made Here will engineer it like crazy.  Who will make the better solution?!?
Should we tell him that everyone on YouTube knows about his tunnel haha. Joke's. Love the video

might be a good idea to put a gas meter in the hole, and make sure you have a confined space exit winch etc.
Make sure tunnel have a good ventilation and enough oxygen while tunneling and after. 🖖🏻

I think the neighbors would be more suspicious from the lack of noise coming from Colin.
This guy knows nuclear war is coming
Intersting minecraft tutorial
Wait until he finds another draft and it leads to a D.U.M.B..
So he's digging straight down into a possible cave? I've played enough minecraft to know that's a bad idea.
so how did you get council planning permission for this? or did you? lol
Glad to see that, even during band practice, you're all still wearing safety ties.
Brilliant!  Yes, I do dig it.  Damn, that is TONS of earth!
2 guys in a garage with a football game on would've been fine.
Time for a mini TBM (tunnel boring machine). C'mon Colin,  you know you want to build one
Never heard of this guy before... but he’s nuts!
Yo Colin, set up some rails with steel buckets that rolls up and automatically dump the soil outside like a real miner or digger  HAHAHA
Grow your Brand and Business to make more money on Instagram. This app only costs $3.
Pfft, I could've done this in 5 minutes in Minecraft
So the part where he found a draft is super scary cause that's not a leak from the outside, that could literally be gas, and really any number of gases, and a lot of them are dangerous as heck. Thats why they brought canary birds down into mines.
Leaving dirt every where you can... What a nice idea!!
Is your capitol at risk? Will London crumble into the Themes?
This is something I always wanted to do with my house.  Are you going to put a lift in this entrance, or another ladder?
he could've saved a lot of time if he just enchanted his shovel with efficiency 4
You might stumble upon One-Eyed Willy's treasure down there.
next movie trailer. "Sicario : Rise of Colinfurze".
so... you made a powered digging bar?
I’m almost certain that Colin has watched Viva La Bam.
What’s he going to do, put a Irma La Douce type elevator in it? Or a Maxwell Smart phone box? That would be good.
Will it be through the mountains?
Runs a welder, chop saw, grinder, and bandsaw yet is worried about using a jackhammer.. Anyone else confused?
Is it really a "secret" tunnel if millions of people watch the prosses?
Any geologists familiar with that fault in the rock and the breeze he felt coming from it? I thought that was interesting.
Colin, I'm honestly disappointed that you didn't make an epic tunnel digging machine
Keep digging, this is cool! Read the comments about the necessity of ventilation now that you have iron in the hole! Iron literally zaps the 02 out of the air, and there have been _a lot_ of accidents over the last 200 years because of this!
normal people during lockdown: time to go play video games colin: *makes a underground fortress
hey Colin, nice project but dont forget about air ventilation
Bloody nutty  chap . Hope it doesn't rain hard . He will be in mud .
Wow, I have waited you videos so hard. But all your videos are best.
What on earth
Mujhe aapka video bahut se bahut Achcha Laga dusron se bhi aapka video mujhe bahut Achcha Laga Hai Aap Jaise dialogue Photo bahut Achcha lagta hai bahut
Colin Colin Colin.. You need a petrol hand held post hole digger to make swiss cheeze of the dirt first thne just bucket it out.
Colin idk if you know this but when 2million people watch your video i don't think its much of a secret.
I was looking for a bucket line that carried the dirt up to the surface on a conveyor and dumped it. Maybe some sort of small rotating digger on an arm. Mounted to a simple cart. Mini mining equipment. Amazing!
Secret tunnel sounds like an atla reference to me
I was thinking of using a petrol/ electric post hole digger.
He used his old bathroom's wall in the foundation. That explains the bathroom bussiness.
Why don’t you just rent one of those augers for digging fence post holes? Once you break up the soil it’s a lot easier to shovel it out.
O gringo não tem um carrinho de mão, coitado
Hurry up and post the next video I’ve watched this 4 times
Honey, Collin is being to quite lately. Go check his tubeviews and see what the bloke is up to.   - Neighbors
You need like a tungsten tipped hydraulic auger at slow revs
I always wondered how mad scientists styled their hair.... Your sponsor ad has explained it all.
Buy a small gas powered post hole auger, chunk the gas motor and replace with an electric motor. Quiet, powerful and light. Ez to add electric cords.
2 million views nice “secret” tunnel

Proof you need to be nucking futs to do YouTube.
Colin! You forgot to never dig straight down while mining! You could've ended up in a lava pit
Imagine if he sells his house one day and the new owners just find this
I think that it's more suspicious that your not making any noise to when you are
Love how this bunker is a secret yet online 😂
I'm surprised this is legal
interesting to watch, I am curious how Colin is allowed to do it - eg local council laws etc.....
Other content Creator making QandA  Colin: hmmmmmp
just curious where did u learn all this stuff, in college? if so what did u major in?

Why not just make your workshop sound proof?  Then you can work on loud things anytime you want.
There's an easier way to do this, not sure what it is but I'm pretty sure it involves hiring Mexicans.
You absolutely need a lift at both ends.
👍👍👍💯
I always knew Colin Furze could build anything, but now he's literally moving the earth.  Truly groundbreaking.
Might need rock/anchor bolts just in case
Wait, WHAT DOES THE CRACK LEAD TO??
Colin treats his neighbours so well!
I'm sure this is all up to code
Youre already know that he prep for 202z the Z year
So many questions. Noise?  What is wrong with your neighbors?  Perhaps I should move in next door. I'm never home anyway
what Colin furze does when mum's not home
If there is no differences between the sexes the. Why is there a need for women sports.
Here in america we say fuck em neighbors 🤷🏼😅😂😂😂😂😂
I'm convinced Colin just can't help but dig weird tunnels and rooms in his garden at this point xD
i have no clue why tf this is so interesting lol
I wasn't expecting my day to involve being caught up in someone's attempt to dig a big hole, but I here I am, I guess... This is the ultimate childhood fantasy
I see your a big fan of el chapo
One of the saddest days in history will be when Colin finally grows up and stops making things like this....  Until then..... TURN IT UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Thanks Colin for all you do.... We love ya man!!!!
0:36 why is there crunchys in the floor XD
Next video please I can’t wait any longer
Use an Australian opal tunnel digger.
Love both Collin and James, wish I could meet you guys😥.  Yall are awesome 👍😁
My dood got a whole mineshaft under his shed
It’s not secret if 2.2 million people have seen it 😴
Dude this is wicked but WHERE WAS THE DRAFT COMING FROM? I must know!
did anyone else when they where a kid at the beach and had nothing to do just dig a giant hole for a few ours
Don't you know it's dangerous to dig directly down? You might end up digging through a cave and falling in a pool of lava.
We get an idea how difficult YOUTUBE can be when you advertise complete BS
I would love to see a livestream of the process honestly. Just found this and it's great.
If you need something for anything... call "*the Furze*"

Wow I just realized I have been watching you for 3 years now that’s crazy
I loved the Great Escape reference! One of my favorite movies.
You guys don't have a fencers bar in the UK?
The fact you are digging in a tie... lol
What a crazy project 🤔  Keep it up
Talk about fucking content lol
All of the sound is comming out of your shed. Sound proof the shed and it would lessen the noise people would hear.
A "secret tunnel" highlighted on Youtube is an oxymoron...
I wonder why you don't build a Conveyor to automatically transport the Dirt 🤔
When I was 16 I spent my summer digging a water well in my parents yard about same size twice deeper. Doing it all manual with a pickaxe and shovel . Sparking every time I hit the rock with pickaxe. So, I can understand the fun you are having.
Will the mystery of the draft be solved.  Where are those cubic meters of dirt going. And wheel barrow?
Oi! Youse got a loicense for that tunnel?
As Jeannie says on @mxrplays "Dig a tunnel Dig Dig a tunnel."
Excellent video man, I LOVE your enthusiasm for all things! :)  Cheering you on from New Hampshire!! -Fred

https://discord.gg/kNTCdq3g
oh no... COLIN THAT IS NOT A DRAFT THAT IS NATURAL GAA.....
Did you Pan the dirt for gold? You may have threw away your fortune
Why did you use the tubs instead of a wheelbarrow?
Was wondering...?? How do you know there are no giant boulders or bedrock that will block your tunnel, and prevent your cool tunnel plan?
Mr Bean
The digging method is pretty slow. What if you made some sort of device like the archimedes screw. I imagine it would work by using the hydraulics to force a cylinder into the dirt. Then you could drive the screw into the cylinder until all of the dirt is removed. Pull the cylinder out with hydraulics and repeat.
It’s not very secret is it over 2.2 million people have seen this 🤦‍♂️ 😂
This is frigging brilliant!
You dug that big of a hole by hand o_o not an easy task
Positive comment.

Make a hydraulic auger to dig with. Man with your talent will do it easy plus would make a good video.

Would it not just be easier to use a corkscrew contraption?
Pathetic. An Indian man with a stick and a bucket could do the whole tunnel in less than a week + build a swimming pool aswell
Colin, you have the tools, you have the technology and you have the engineering skills! MAKE YOUR OWN MINIATURE TBR Tunnel Boring Machine! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunnel_boring_machine You can make your own miniature version of one, hydraulic powered of course!
ahahahaha you’re so creative with these videos
Holy crap Colin. That tunnel is way deeper than I thought it was going to be.
Very clever man 👍🏻
Colin plays Minecraft in real life ⚡⚡😀
I’m surprised you didn’t just build some sort of miniature excavator that fits over the hole
I can never tell if I'd want to be neighbours with him or not 🤣
Well, that escalated very slowly and right in front of my eyes, and I’m still surprised!
Dont suppose you could make an auger attached to a hydraulic motor and use a ram to feed it along with bits of rhs to extend the reach, be a hell of a lot faster than the other implements
DId i miss the part about  where the crack was bringing the air in?
For the love of god Colin, fabricate a vac-truck setup (high pressure water blaster and flexi-vacuum tube to remove material to an external tank)
I would both love and hate being Colin's neighbor.

What about a safe room bunker under the bunker...
Amazing job Colin, can't wait for the next video!
If Minecraft has taught me anything, never dig straight down...
No permit? Just wait when the city finds out about it. Your last video in this series will be HOW TO INFILL AN ILLEGAL TUNEL.

Could you make a electric ground auger to break loose the soil? Like the 2 stroke ones but with a electric motor to be quiet
I'm still wondering how many noise complaints he has gotten and how much is he's electrical bill
When the kids tell dad they spent a year diging a hole.   And one wonders how they are going to fill it in....   Still a hole.in the trees behind the house.  Dug it when I was a teenager
absolutely amazing cant believe this is allowed
Do you need council approval to dig such a tunnel? It’s awesome.
Swampy ware I at . I ame jelly. $#@!  _[<.
if i could be a colin furze, i wish to be just like you !
Dig a tunnel, dig dig a tunnel. Quick!! Before the hyenas come! You just need this song on repeat
why cut perfectly good spades and not get an army entrenching tool that is short and made for this?
Minecraft na vida real é nivel Very Super Hard 😅
Absolutely bonkers, Colin. I like it. I like it alot.
It's like 'the Bank Job' over there with Jason Statham, or Kevin Bacon in 'Stir of Echoes'
He dig.
colin is legit the best the guy made Hydrolic tool to dig then made a god dam crane so he did not need to lift the buckets u are LEGIT amazing dude
Classic, thanks sooooooo much for the content!👌🤙
You really do not want to run water down there. It could open up a sink hole under your house...
Wait. What the hell is cocoa pops??? And who wants to send me a box to Texas
That'll be too loud! *Fires up CNC*
He is cosplaying Denji it's look similar
Did you get planning permission for digging the tunnel?.
Colin what’s going to happen if you hit some wires while digging will you move the cut them and rewrote them?
STAY SAFE~!
Geez, that music sucks a$$! Too damned... violent?!! Something. Anyway, ditch that crap and I'll subscribe.
hey, I'm concerned about cave-in protection. the pressure from even a 6 foot hole caving in on you could be deadly. I have heard horror stories from my fellow construction workers. please be safe, digging a hole can easily become dangerous
There’s a healthy mix of doomsday preppers and sexual predators subbing to this channel
Get yourself a gas monitor when you’re down the hole
Uuummmm, was that asbestos sheeting ?
Just use high explosives to dig the rest. Neighbors won't suspect a thing.
So a guy with one of the biggest YouTube channels and 11 million subscribers is digging a “secret” tunnel.   I’m sure the neighbors will never find out.
If I was her Majesty‘s government, I would get very curious.
I hate that I found this build too soon
Isn't secret anymore
Try an auger,, break up 3 feet at a time.
You should soundproof the shed so you can use power tools
One of the craziest but most insane and awesome ones ever done! So cool!
Not available in the US
"it put the lotion in the bucket or it get's the hose again"
Why not just high pressure hose (like a pressure washer) and then just pump the slurry out ?
Not too secret if 11 million people know about it bro
SEEEECCCRRREEEETTT TUUUNNNNEEEELLL!!!!! Seeecccrreettt tunnneeelll!!! Secret secret secret secret TUNNNEEEELLLL!!!!!
Tunnel to the pub.
Sweet jesus I love this channel 😍
I'm really interested if, his tunnel will have some codes it has to meet, and if that's addressed.  Also how he will address flooding.  He's a smart guy, can't wait for him to address these issues!!
A secret that's trending on YouTube...
Could you maybe pickup an auger and swap the motor for an electric one?
you are the ultimate nutter. any ideas where the draft was coming from? should help for ventilation
How to become Saddam Hussein
the person who bought the coco-dirt: "god damn it"
I am very curious how his house would sell with all these modifications
When you design the Mars Spaceship and Rover, I'll volunteer for the trip. If anyone can beat Elon, you can!
Imagine finding a viking grave
Imagine he’s just renting 😳
This real makes you appreciate the ingenuity of Mexican cartel tunnel diggers
Minecraft let's players mysteriously find diamonds off camera, Colin mysteriously finds a cave system under his house
Surprised you didn't just build your own mini TBM
Hey I just remembered the next couple of lines Two lovers, destined for one another But the war still divides their people So they built a tunnel through the mountain And now they can be together forever SECRET TUNNEL SECRET TUNNEL  THROUGH THE MOUNTAIN SECRET SECRET SECRET SECRET TUNNEL
Yes but how is it secret if anyone can watch this
My house built on a mountain 😭 I wish to do this project
If i tried this where i live i would hit water 75 cm deep
No e tenido lo que dice porque no hablo ingles pero igualmente me encantan sus videos xD
The tunnel isn’t secret anymore.
Two episodes and no fireworks .......... Imposter
This the most exciting channel on YouTube! Keep it up Colin you genius👍🏽
how much noise could it be making that deep?
Einfach minecraft in real life
So is this adding on removing value to your property?
I dont care about the tunnel as much as where does the other end of that crack lead to
Where did the draft come from? I'd love to see a follow up!
This is absolutely amazing, but Colin you have 11 million subscribers and 2 million views on this video. Why does it matter if your neighbors know? They are probably subscribers!
In minencraft this would take like 2 seconds
So what happened to the crack where ate was flowing in? Thought you might of hit an old sewer line
My man's going to y 12 to get the strip mine diamonds
I got recommended this today. AND SO  DID YOU!
Can't really call it a "secret" tunnel if over 2 million people know about it
Hamas members thumbsup and subscribe.
Did anyone else wonder why he was wearing nice clothes while digging?
Pablo called..... he wants his tunnel back
This video made me subscribe. Only problem is that you are just a little bit too low energy. Ever consider a daily vitamin? Lol.
Why don’t u get a spit instead of a spade
I could NEVER do that, it scares me like hell!
I bet  this guy  could  complicate a  stick  in fine fashion.
You need to do Rambo last blood and put traps everywhere
Proper Mission!
I assume you are going to line it with cement.
This man deserves every bit of respect from every single subscriber he has…..
Colin: Last Blood
Colin: builts a bunker in his back yard Youtube: this offends me take down his adds
So much for the tunnel being a "Secret",LOL
Jack hammer works well on clay too. Shovel bit. Buckets would help instead too, but nice build
Amazing project I just wondering if you have council permission for this?
8:29 🏳️‍🌈🔔
When are we going to see an underground workshop!
why are you don’t building a tunnel drilling machine?
Nice
where did you buy your plasma cutter i mean cnc thingy
If there was an award for best Youtube channel ever. You would get it no doubt dude.
How the hell dose he have that tie on the whole time ?😂😂
Now you just need to make Your own DIY TBM - Tunnel Boring Machine or Bucket-Wheel Excavator or Auger Screw Excavator   It would help if you could make a few Robotic CNC Minions so work is carried  out 24/7 get  James Bruton  in again so he can do the Software for a Fully Autonomous & Automated Excavator - Intel RealSense  Lidar Camera L515 + USB Intel® Neural Compute Stick 2 + GPS + IMU > Intel RealSense Depth Camera D435i as long as you give it utility maps [Power - Water - Gas lines - Sewage - Storm Water - phone ducts  ] it should avoid them Autonomously
Build a hydraulic auger drill
Well... its not a SECRET tunnel if it got 2+ million views
You really aren't going to show what that cave gap with airflow was?  That.. Was frustrating editing to have you mention it, and show it so much, and then just move on without another mention.
Did this require a permit?
Mexican cartels will be watching this with interest.
'sponsor. Don't skip this bit-'  Me: LLLLLL
Really you couldnt just done the work quet with the hydraulic during lockdown?
“SECRET TUNNNEEEEEEELLLLL, SECRET TUNNNEEEEEEELLLLL” THROUGH THE GROUND!”
I'm surprised he didn't start out with an auger and a transport belt.
Stupid, making big drill bos 😅🤣🤣🤣
bro do you have a music playlist?
What an absolute nutcase 🤣
Not everyone can take a video of them selfs digging dirt and make it extreamly fun to watch!:)
Do you also check if there is any nearby heavy construction going on or something like that whenever ur working on it?  The vibration might be dangerous
What about your Yankee viewers? We can't use the UK Apps unless they're specified for here to. Still listening to the sponsor. :P
Are you renting the house if so I want to see the landlord, if you bought the house it alright.
Pls don't ☠️☠️ this is absolutely the last project that's worth ☠️☠️ing for
Que miedo. 😱😱
31st july is my birthday
Installing another hydraulic system?  Wait, you recorded this ages ago, did you install a pump just for this and invent a different project as a cover-up?
Next episode some off cam minding
Should have used an efficiency 5 diamond pickaxe. You would have finished your tunnel in 5 minutes
Just enchant your tools with efficiency 5.
Did he just tap a hardened Chisel, a braver man than I.
You must be either crazy or super creative to come up with these ideas,   Oh, you’re both 😂🤣😜😎✌🏽
I like the idea of a pneumatic conveying tube to suck the dirt out to the garden. And put it into a bin.
The comedy bit when getting rid of the dirt was very comedic lol
New thing on my bucket list
Saddem Hussein 2
Wow 👀😅
You need to give the guys who build the swimming pools with there hands a shout 😅
hey Kiwis! Watch out! Someone may unexpectedly appear in your basement this year!
Do you call utilities or surveyors before something like this? I can totally see someone hitting gas or water lines doing this. lol
When you make a video of it,its not secret anymore.
minecraft in real life!
The old man in me thinks two things:  1) my back would give out after an hour of that  2) this seems terribly unsafe  The me who's actually about the same age as Colin, thinks two other things:  1) I'm pathetically out of shape for my age  2) when did I get so lame as to care about "safety"?
Over 2M views doesn’t seem that secret ( just kidding liked the video)!
The most publicized SECRET tunnel ever
A Brit that knows how to weld?  Is this normal?
Dose he no something we don’t he he . Great video well done guys.👍🇬🇧🤘
I do this for a living.    He has no idea to the world of hurt that can come to him
What did I just watch
MAKE A SEMI-AUTOMATIC CANON!!!!
Only last week an old chap finds a 17 foot deep well under his living room floor. Colin is like You wanna see mine?
You my friend are the reason Im going to school for robotics and a hefty handful of other topics. This ladies and gentlemen is a fantastic YouTuber with great content. Let the chaos flow you madman 😂
what!? where is his mask in the store!? 1:51
Imagine being some nobody who goes to buy Colin's home from some third party sellers in a hundred years. All of the cool, subterranean stuff forgotten, only to go and try to dig something of your own one day.
Damn!!! aren't you scared of a collapse of the tunnel under that pile of rocks? btw amazing work!! keep going i want to see the full tunnel hehe
I'm surprised Furze didn't make a drill, with conveyor system to eliminate dirt. like some dirt based water lift kinda thing?
Have you checked to manage sure you won’t run into gas or water lines?
Holy hell, I get tired just by watching you. Where do you find all that energy?
You're just CRAZY!!!!
They don't wear skinny jeans in prison.
Colin Furze a known youtuber with 11 million viewers and he is worried about building a secret tunnel from his neighbors. So he makes a video about this secret tunnel and posts it to his channel. It's not a secret mate.
What happened with the little cave vent? I'm assuming it's still just a little crack in the wall?
This looks way easier when I do it in Terraria.
and tomorrow, an exavator portable....
Pero, en Minecraft se ve tan facil
Colin as usual is totally GANGSTER!!!
I love the respect for your neighbors, explains the amount of time this will take, loving this project, look forward to seeing it progress
Freakin' lunatic!
The neighbors are probably suspicious because of how quite it's been the last couple weeks
Fool, should tiny trumpet instead, still pretty good.
I wonder if Henry and Jeannie know about this.
Digging a secret tunnel that is not that secret anymore
At this rate Furze might get a job offer from El Chapo lol
Good to know you had a mate with you playa
I bet there is spiders down there.....
secret with more then 2mln views :D LOL
Dude awesome .... !
cmon colin, we both know saddam hussein is hidden 2 meters deep into that tunnel
He's making the dreams people have in his backyard on youtube
You're building a rape dungeon.
He’s preparing for something😭
Hes a madman
I’m so happy that Colin is still popular. I remember discovering this guy when he did the wall of death, and now he’s literally building a tunnel system
Matthew 13:15 For this people's heart is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any time they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and should understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.
what did you do during lockdown? oh i was just digging a tunnel under my shed
Saddam Hussein tunnel
I can't f*cking download cause I live in a f*cking country called France, THAT F*CKING SUCK THIS COUNTRY 😭😭😭😭
Imagine someone buying that coco pops :/ 2:00
You don't need an app to buy Tesla stock.  The only stock anyone should buy.  Unless you can get stock in SpaceX, Boring Company, or Starlink!
Did he need any sort of building permission ?
I'd be underwater by now at my place....OOH a secret UNDERWATER tunnel!!!! 🤣
Proper crazy! And the only kind of crazy that results into top level content!
S.O.S Colombia. Es increible la ineptitud y poco profesionalismo del narcogobierno colombiano. Corruptos desvergonzados intentando quedar impunes, inclusive en la ONU. Colombianos, sigan adelante con las protestas hasta lograr una nueva constitución, una carta magna donde haya igualdad y equidad para todas las personas en Colombia. Chile lo ha logrado. Colombia lo logrará pronto. Seguir adelante hermanos.
Digging is not expensive.  It is however very time consuming and hard work.
Ummm, I'd rather just walk across the yard.
Please be mindful of your airflow. Asphyxiation is real
I once thought about drilling with water pressure into the earth well but then you have water that has to go back and a mud and collapse danger well at such something
I cant wait for part 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, etc
can't belive you are doing this. I know you are crazy with other builds but...?! I love it though
Surely this must be illegal 😂
Truly one of the original mad lads. Cheers mate.
have not yet encountered any ground water.. That also show how high the earth there is t is cool
Rinaldi and Kline Authentic New York Excavation
WINDOWS  t see the earth a truly insane project, pit props, there is something exciting about being underground. portholes. how far down do worms go. roots,
When the science guy grows up and gets powertools
PLEASE RUNA SUPER MAGNET THROUGH THE DIRT YOU COLLECT AND SEE HOW MUCH IRON YOU GET FROM THE DIRT(IT WORKS)
Love this guy 😁
You could make a pizza/earth oven with all that soil
A secret tunnel number 5 on trending hmmm
German question: Buildingpermit?
not a secret anymore
You are a glorious mad scientist. I appreciate you.
this is insane, I couldn't even do 1/100th of what Colin did. Hopefully he got the proper authorization to do all this and knows the terrain underneath. Wouldn't want to break into a water main or discover an underground water system...or worse. It'd be cool if he build a mini-TBM (tunnel boring machine).
As a Texan where I live you can get about 2-3 ft down before you hit clay and or rock. So, what is this sorcery of actually being able to dig a hole with a shovel?
Part 3? When?
Secret tunnel no one is knowing about it axcept 2minlion people who watched this video.
SECRET TUNNELLLLLL🎶🎵🎶
Wonder do you need planning permission for something like this?
rule number 1: never dig straight down
how many bugs did u unearth throughout the whole project
I can’t wait till there’s a zombie apocalypse and ur the only one alive
Now isn't secred
this better not end with "it puts the lotion on its skin....."
not much of a secret now...lol
Breathtaking moments happened with these people | part 1 🤣👇 https://youtu.be/fIctN_i4pVo
Excellent! Fred West would be proud...
I am 100% here for this tunnel. Also, if you ever sell your house, please make a video of buyers reactions.
Signed up with Colins link.  Didn't get my free share :-(
As a member of our City tunneling team for the past 18 years, i'm worried for your safety @Colinfurze  The metal frames you installed at the corners  do not have t he strength to withstand ground pressure. you should consider replacing them with metal i-beam uprights with 4x4 cross braces, combined with over lapping 2x6 face boards wedged behind to maintain  wall pressure.  The metal  chicken grates also have no ability to push back against ground pressure as wall panels.  I think this is a super kewl project, please look into doing it safely for yourself, your buildings overhead, and all of us who watch you.
Imagine being Colin’s neighbour, how cool would that be.
I can't seem to figure, why a doctor hasn't locked you up years ago. That being said - this is probably the coolest thing ever built!
If you move out your house are you going to fill the bunker up with sand or are you just going to leave it there for the new owners
https://youtu.be/yf_FeldjgVw
My man Colin is playing minecraft in real life. Keep up the creative juice flowing.
El chapo vibes
Seeing the hydraulic pump go in really dates this video, I remember seeing you showing it off about 2 years ago
Colin has been building all sorts of shit creating a racket in his garage with grinders, hammers and other mechanical equipment. I not convinced that  the neighbors would get too suspicious over hearing the noise of him digging a tunnel. Lol
How is it a secret tunnel if you made a youtube video about it though.
Where can I buy this house?
are you able to put in those sound silencers that youtubers put on there walls on the sides of the shed
I'm sorry Colin. I LOVE all of your genius inventions. Every single one of them. This is not you. Please don't let any company to take you off course. Come back, Your fans
I love that he used the Great Escape scene, I was thinking that's what he should do!
keep on digging
I cant be the only one seeing the connection to "meth tank dude"
أَفَحَسِبْتُمْ أَنَّمَا خَلَقْنَاكُمْ عَبَثًا وَأَنَّكُمْ إِلَيْنَا لَا تُرْجَعُونَ﴾  Then did you think that We created you uselessly and that to Us you would not be returned?"  Translated From Quran
Colin I'm building a wooden plane can I get some advise on the best wood?
El Chapo will be proud watching this
Make a hole in the wall or a cabinet and store stuff in there
So how far down did that fissure in the ground go? Definitely gonna be a cave through it leading somewhere.  Also, cant believe there isnt some sort of Collin Archimedes screw type digging thing, rather than by bucket and hand.
Amazing mate have a beer
This is so cool!!!!!
This guy definitely plays gta 5 lol
I'm pretty sure they wouldn't hear you digging. If I remember correctly Elon Musk said something about No one being able to hear his drilling machine relatively close to the surface because the ground insulates the sound so well.
Public "secred" :)
Out of all the weird things I have watched on youtube, a man digging a tunnel in his back yard might not be the weirdest one.
wow in germany you can only go 1,5 meters down without license
I’m honestly worried about Colin
The Neighbours that watching that Video :D "I can see you"
I really liked seeing you modify things and the basket-lift was genius! This is gonna be epic! ^_^ You should paint the finished walls something unexpected..like yellow and pink 😂
Looks like some good clay - sell it to a potter
Saddam Hussein
Im going to choose to believe there are now dirt deposits all over his city
You should get more torches and diamond pickaxe if you dig down to creepers cave.
2:42 Коля изобрёл сапёрную лопату
Should have used a shovel instead of a spade for the soil
Furze goes all Fred Dibnah on us!!!! The tunnel needs a name
Dude digs hole, gets 2m views in 1 day, and trends in top-10 on YouTube.  Legend
Mr.Prep
The way you're acting I cannot help but think you're stark raving mad but by God if it doesn't make entertaining content. Rock on, my dude!
Can I help did the tunnel? I'm a dab hand with a shovel!
I've never seen anyone dig with a flat shovel.
2M views in a day! That shows how badass project this is.
“SECRET TUNNEL! SECRET TUNNEL! SECRET SECRET SECRET TUNNEL!”
I feel like his videos would be cooler if they weren't aimed towards young children I feel like he's talking to me like I'm 5 and that ruins some of the entertainment factor from the video
Mmm is this illegal The only concrete that I can imagine this will be illegal is Russia
Ah yes the most professional part to anyone work persons kit colourful tubs
I can't help wondering if this is actually legal for him to do. Lol.  I mean...not that that's ever mattered to most homeowners.
Colin EL CHAPO Furze
Come on bro you have to name your tunnel
Crazy how long I’ve watched this dude bro, and it’s always been entertaining
Stole my idea https://www.instagram.com/p/CQ1nf2Tl-aL/?utm_medium=copy_link
It’s not really a secret cause hundreds of thousands are watching …….
Imagine supporting your family doing your favourite things
You need a tbm, well a small one, that would be a good build series in its self.
The fact that he didn't hit a single underground pipe or wire
Secret tunnel Secret tunnel Through the mountain
Why do you even live at a property with neighbors at this point? Go find a few acres to Furzify to your hearts desire
That's an unimaginable amount of elbow grease.
everyone: ugh lockdown, stranded at home colin: lets dig a tunnel! also colin: dont disturb the neighbours
Some next level content
It would probably be more alarming to the neighbors if there weren’t strange loud noises coming from the shed
this is giving me la casa de papel vibes just saying
It’s no secret if there’s a video about it
i can't belive we all gathered here to watch a man digging a tunnel
When your engineer looks like the Pubg guy xD
after digging all day no way you could play that trombone your arms would be noodles LOL
How suspicious that Collin lad next door is not even making any noise 🤔🤔🤔🤔
#4 on Trending… this is next level secret if you ask me
Definition of secret: something that is kept or meant to be kept unknown or unseen by others. 😂 cool tunnel tho!!
it isn't a secret tunnel
Is that legal?
When you start digging Hour 1: This is awesome!  Hour 2: This is bull$hi+
cool minecraft texture pack
outside the building get a backhoe
Colin is so considerate about his neighbours!
Its the hell underneath the crack
Minecraft makes this look easy..
Colin, you achieve a level of craziness I aspire to. Never change
Liken that mesh will prevent any collapse, you need to put pressure against the walls to keep them in place, if they even start to move, it will be too late to hold it back. You should be pouring reinforced concrete as you move down.
If it's secret tunnel, you need a secret entrance! Everyone could see the cover door :)
If you have to do this in survival mode, why don't you just store your leftover dirt blocks in wooden chests in the attic like a normal person? I always like to have a full stack of cobblestone there as well and a few Ender Pearls just in case a Creeper parks in front of my door...
I could imagine a few other things you and Tom could be doing in the shed with loud music on.
OMFG! Stumbled across this incredible video and immediately thought that this man needs his own proppa TV program/channel.  Where the fk is Amazon/Netflix?!?!?!   Imagine what amazing things this man would do then!  I'm sure he would have easily beaten the likes of Bezos/Musk/Branson to space!!!  The most charismatic Engineer I've ever seen....
it looks like a undergroud mine
Need craft transporter lenta line out ground
Chido
Mad lad!
Even him advertising a product is entertaining
your average mad scientist is at it again
I feel the desire to keep things quiet might have something to do with one, or thirty, complaints filled by the neighbor.
I'd be so demotivated but Colin: Thisss is the perfect Furze project, lmao
Him: secret tunnel      Also him: uploads to YouTube
What are rules for planning permission for a tunnel?  I assume that the location will need to recorded in case someone tries to build an extension on it...
Did you realy leave dirt coco puffs on the shelf??
surprised you don't just make a conveyor or something to transport the dirt out into a truck bin or something.
Secret tunnel. 2m views.
Mate that's epic on a huge scale as always, great to watch 👍🏻👍🏻
Keeping it a secret- The 2 million people watching :👁👄👁
You made this in April
When Colin is promoting share trading apps you know it is time to get out of the market, nevermind the fact the mulitple companies are promoting shares to kids.
LOl the pump in the desk I've seen ages ago, can you imagine how long Colin had to keep his tunnel a secret from us :O
Why are you worried about if they will hear you? you're literally uploading all these so everyone knows.
13:31 Colin want this done silent so noone can relise what he done (perhaps noone will know what's under hes shed floor)  hyyy only 11mln people :)
When can we expect part 3?
Enerpac are jealous of your design for sure
You should fashion a kind of mine lift in there 😁
Lol the counsel and insurance lawyers watching: O_O
3:53 I wonder if mafias burry bodies also like this
He dresses like Player Unknown, without the helmet tho.
Colin, mate. I hate to break that down to you, but making a youtubevideo about a secret tunnel with 2million+ views leaves the tunnel not very secret....
The time and effort put in to this is awesome.
Heart of a kid smarts of an adult best channel I've known
This video is fake, you can tell because he's British and planning permission exists.
When then time comes to sell his house, he wont be able to get it appraised. There is literally 0 precedence so anything like all this stuff he has LOL
So fun henry
Do you not need planning permissions for this sort of stuff or there is exception for building an underground bunker and secret tunnel to compliment it.
anyone else get a virus pop up on the link in description (its wierd as colins legit) but that links broken
3:20 POV u're a shovel
I’m sure you was part of the Hatton garden heist 🤫🤔🤔
to slow
doubles as a faraday cage
Maybe it isn’t that secret, since i am watching you build it from scratch. But still, great job!
Can you talk a bit about permission for this? Does the council know about this ?
I started out bemused but now I'm very curious 🤔
One of these days he's going to build his own Tracy Island!
Part 2 - #2 on trending
No matter what, you need to scan the dirt with a metaldetektor. 💥🎶👍😊
Disappointed you didn't build a digging machine with a jet engine as that's what you neighbor are use to.
pushing financial investment is not okay.
Hope you got planning permission for that, those planners are ruthless when you do something without it.
Colin's next sponsor will be................ . .  El Chapo ;)
You are crazy.... And i llllove that
do you need planning permission ?
Colin: "No one has a clue what we're doing in here." Neighbors: (Watching this YouTube video) "Ah, that explains all the noises he has been making down there. He thinks we don't know!"
Sick project you need like a miners helmet for this one tho to complete the look
The only channel I never akip anything. Not even sponser part!
Well, not that much of a secret anymore, is it?
What about a safe oxygen flow? Look like the hole is really deep and it might get dangerous when you're working in the hole.
This might actually be interesting content if you cut out half of the mugging and gimmicks.
Heyy Guys, I'm back and I did some mining off camera...
hes basically playing minecraft irl bruh
Awsome stuff Colin
Great video :D And I love the hair styling with the vacuum :D
my back hurts watching this
Did this require planning permission?
This project is BIG and alot of work!   Keep it up!  :D
That's pretty bloody deep, Colin. Ambitious as ever!
I cant be the only one who thinks he is a time travler
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L6920ZY-68
Need to dig quietly, so I’m going to use loud power tools to build a quiet digging tool.
If you really want a hidden tunnel, make a wooden latch under the floor latch that is made of plywood, but covered with glue and soil. That way, when the metal hatch is found it can be opened and it'll just look like dirt.
i skipped the sponsor. hahahha
Absolutely crazy, not Colin, me I literally just watched a man digging a hole, and enjoyed it. 😂
you need to build a tunnel dig machine
It aint a secret if you're posting it on the internet 🧃
The only guy I've ever seen who digs dirt while wearing a neck tie...
This man is the next El Chapo
I hope you drank more than one pint during this process, Colin. I'd say at least a sip or two with every spade full of dirt.
I just came here from MrBallen's video about Daniel Beckwitt and his underground nuclear fallout shelter
Awesome...
Cant u live stream this??
when you are old and grey, and you decide to sell your home... please please please do me one favor. dont tell anyone of what you did and let them discover it themselves
Wait, just close the hatch and it will be quieter.
Next time I do a bank job I'll know where to come for silent digging equiptment
When is part 3 coming?
there is no channel i would rather watch. this is one epic project it has me so stoked😝😝
What will you do if you find a body?
Me in minecraft fr
50 fps???? Whyyy??
you're crazy  I love it
Didn't you used to have girlfriend?  I hope everything is okay.  I kinda think she dumped you because if she was around she'd never let you do this.  I did "like" and enjoy the video though.   If she does ever comes back, just tell her the large holes were there already and she just never noticed.
But why did you use a flat shovel???
How many times have you made tunnels in your backyard?
I lost my shit when you did that beach underground thing, way to make a claustrophobe with burial anxiety feel at home. Otherwise, good work.
I love your stuff Furze, but boy am I glad I'm not your neighbour ;-)
His grandfather was an excellent, escape tunneler in ww2, family genes are breaking out,, watch out any one who buys the house when he is finally finished,,, awesome stuff ☘️☘️☘️☘️☘️☘️
Colin you need bigger buckets it is good for your back
Colin is definitely weary of a war and just making a YouTube series out if it
Ah shit guys. Whos turn was it to watch colin? Hes done gone and dug himself in a hole now.
It's not secret if you post it on YouTube
Esto.. ya es demasiado..
Two lovers, forbidden from one a other Secret tunnel! Secret tunnel!
Did he remember to call whatever his version of 811 is?
You are the crazy sciencetist who build your own property under the street 🤫
2:15 "strange pile of earth appearing in stamford" LMAO :)
Mr Furze knows something the rest of us don't.....I bet he's stock piled his toilet rolls & food.🤔
you are a bloody nutter but i like the video.
We both have the same neighbor problem, they hate the amount of noise we make. 🤣
Waht if you neighbor watch your videos?
Have you considered large sound dampening equipment?
"the Danish invader" I completely lost it when I read it, now I'm going to have this stupid smirk plastered on my face for the rest of day
I think he takes crack befor he made this vid lol
I want to know about The Crack lol. Colin has found something...
I wanna feel this motivated all time
Anybody else got the urge to tunnel their garden
Colin... This is crazy crazy crazy.
Amazing work..!!! I'd even watch a one hour video. This was extremely entertaining. ❤️
You noob...... Never mine straight down!
ahh the joy of diggin for a no reason
Who wants to see where that crack at 11:00 goes? ==> LIKE
Inspired by el chapos smuggling tunnels
I wish I could do this.. my house sits on all clay foundation
Also, trying to figure out how you'll react when you pierce the wall of the banks' vault and see the safe deposit boxes with all those diamonds????
He is digging his own grave
I love how this dude has the sponsors and money to just do what he want because it fun
This guy would be perfect for vault-tec!
As a Dane... What's the "The Danish Invader" @ 2:08 ?
loxas lordas
10:51 when you finally hit a cave in minecraft
You just broke the first rule: never dig straight down I can see some iron ore blocks right there, if you keep digging this way you will find diamonds soon
I really hope he's getting advice from a professional trencher and/or engineer... That shoring does not look nearly strong enough to hold back a cave-in....
I would love to know if you needed to get planning or speak to the council about the secret tunnel system. I imagine you would have for the bunker but this addition?!?  We get grief all the time for simple things to do with builds and renovations at work!!
Brilliant sci-fi'ish project. Luv it!
have you measured/calculated how many tons of dirt you must dig out? It'll take YEARS!
Where was the air coming from? What happened to the crack?
This guy must have watched a bunch of Dexter Laboratory.
Gives me new respect for those guys who dig the drug runner tunnels between houses in Mexico and the US.
He crazy
Coulda just bought a small shovel lol
This is, perhaps, the least secret "secret" tunnel in history.
you shouldave hired the guy who makes entire villas out of dirt with nothing but his hands and a stick.
NOT AVERY SECRET TUNNEL WITH NEARLY 2 MILLION VIEWS.
use a drill~
Ever had your house evaluated wonder hom much all these weird bunkers and tunnels add to the value 😅
Okay, this is insane, I love it!
EPIC Projekt!!!!
Did I just watch you weld a big piece of pipe on onto your shovel? Had fun lifting that over your head a couple thousand times, didya?
As secret as possible with 1.9 mil views and counting, lol
I tried to do something like this I dug a 10 ft deep 6 ft wide hole completely in the middle of the night with headlamps after work with a few buddies but we hit solid rock at 10 ft.
This tunnel is the perfect excuse to mount some cool new stuff in the shed.
I can't imagine the future owners of Colin's house. When most of the things he did will be half forgotten. When they will decide to change/clean the carpet of the garage, and they will find a secret tunnel. xD
Digging a "secret" tunnel: proceeds to show the world his plan.🤫🤫
so secret only 1.9 million people know about it
I'm watching Minecraft irl
Never had one lesson. Lol
Minecraft in Reallife 😂 Don't dig straight down !!!
I WANT TO HELP DIGGING LOL THAT LOOKS FUN
The best series on youtube
Secret tunnel! Secret tunnel! Through the mountain! Secret, secret, secret, secret tunnel! Yeah!
Not gonna lie, this guy is like Rick from Rick and Morty but IRL
Been playing to much minecraft lol
Colin no don't dig straight down!!!! You're going to hit lava noooooo
This is my final decision, he is my favourite youtuber
By stuff on working bench, your top followers know, when you do which tunel project part 😃
Mining chunks
Who else agrees that this was super amazing! Now I want to build on just like it!
Congrats on #2 on trending!
NEVER DIG STRAIGHT DOWN COLIN, YOU'RE GONNA FALL INTO LAVA!!!
I love how colin cant do a vid without modifying or building something 😂😂😂
You shield built a small conveyor
What is this music😂
why
Ive done it under my house but then it got flooded in the winter , here goes 2 years for nothing ;/
Imagine if he was renting the house and didn't tell the landlord
What about a boring machine Col with 2 wheels, buckets and a chain or rope
Your tunnel isn't secret 😉
2 Million views in 24 hours: "secret" tunnel :p
This is so cool!
Palestinians would be proud
🇩🇰🇩🇰
Самоделкин лучше бы сделал)
Why don't you build a small jet engine powered excavator?
Rumour has it is that Colin makes weapons and sells them to dodgy men in the pub, and he needs this tunnel to escape the police
You are crazy man....!!!
Saddam Hussein
You need a batman style elevator.
Mmm dirt flavour coco pops
You should make a video where you clean our your shed
well fuck bud i’ll see ya in 2023 for the next installment of this series.
This guys playing Minecraft irl
Keeping the tunnel secret from the neighbours. By the time they see this video it's too late.
*wants to keep the tunnel project a secret from the neighbours*  *uploads on youtube*
Mate, a continuous flight auger. If you really wanted to build something to turn it, hydraulic motor and a frame to slide down the hole as you drill?
I thought surely they would disguise boxes of dirt as recently delivered Amazon packages and set them on the front porch. They will disappear all by themselves.
Definitely waiting for a Buffalo Bill reference. Got the pit, the basket, the hose.. just gotta put the lotion on its skin
ventilation!
Epic 🤘🤘🤘
Do you need permission from the authorities to do this?  Wish I have the enthusiasm to build this myself.
I think at this point he is just gonna make a whole underground facility like he saw Minecraft and said "yes." And I love it
This is saddam hussein.
Nominal people home improvements: Remodelling the Bathroom… Colinfurze: Digging a Secret tunnel
tell ur stupid sponsor to add more reigons....
https://youtu.be/cvAY59BU-wM
Not so secret now mate )
Nothing to see here, just a man hoovering his hair...
This is my not so secret secret tunnel on YouTube and it's trending #4 in the world 😂👍
Probably, you must be helped by Indians?!?!?
There's got to be a TBM build here!?
Did you figure out the cause of the draft at any point?
You know your neighbors hate you and the noise you make when you dig 40feet underground in your own house and still worry about making noise. And you plan rental equipment for when they leave their house.
SECRET TUNNELLLLLLLLLLL SSECRET TUNEELLLLL
i would love to be the person who buys his house after he has sold it
why not make a dirt conveyer ?
12:17 can anyone pls give a hint to the track. Thx a lot!
SECRET TUNNEL! SECRET TUNNEL!
Colin should consider himself lucky to not have fallen into lava while digging straight down
Ah yes #minecraft well its right isnt it
Seems to be 30 years old and has the mind of a 10 year old. no offense
Looks more easy in minecraft.
Never dig straight down!
I’m sure it’s been said, but…  *SECRET TUNNEL!!! SECRET TUNNEL!!!*
im sorry but how the fuck does a dirt and rock hole at thee end have better acoustics than his shed haha
lmao its a new video ı didnt notice it 2 m in 1 day
Man found dead in a tunnel he was making
Minecraft irl
hey Colin, did you know that "Furz" means "Fart" in german? So from this day on I shall call you Colin Farte. I really like this certain ring it has to it :)
Colin...buddy....never heard of a wheel barrow?
watch out for monoxide poisoning with the motor and all that down there
Well, technically its not a secret now because you shared it to youtube
Not much of a secret with it trending
“As quiet as possible” aka I don’t have planning permission and don’t want the neighbours finding out
This isn't a secret  tunnel it's just a tunnel that 1.9 million people know about so if you think about it this is click bait
I forgot this channel existed...
Awesome. Stay safe while digging Colin. Excited to see the next video.
“Don’t want me neighbors to know” let’s post it for the world to see 😂😂 love it!
Congrats 11M subs?
Should of hired a Romanian
Wth 😳
Yes another underground video. Love it.
DID YOU ACTUALLY GET YOUR HANDS DIRTY OR DID A SERVANT DO THE REAL WORK.
Shit! I goddamn like this guy!
Omagh County Court heard how plumber Patsy Kerr has spent the last five years visiting his local pub via a secret tunnel under his house
Look. https://youtu.be/zr5uGi7mil4 And now imagine people rebuild city like London in... 2 MONTHS.. I wonder how deep wold they go if they where going underground insted.
Freetrade is actually pretty cool, 👍 for your sponsor!
What a mad lad
Wat if u moved houses
That soil looks so clay-like you could probably make some pottery out of it.  There's a way to get rid of some of it!
My favorite videos are when your digging
Not very secret if 1.9 million people know about it lmao
One day you should build a tower on your property. Proper defense needs some kind of early warning system.
i get the feeling your neighbours are tosspots.
This is nuts I love it!
i still want to know whats down this crack, where does it lead to?
No one ever, has made digging a hole so entertaining.
Vaccum Excavator, build one
digging all that with only a spade?!?
I'm so upset that Colin didn't build some kind of quarry machine / conveyor belt
OP needs some decent hearing protection when using a jackhammer.
Secret 😂😂😂
any worry about gases welding in a confined space?
Is it legal? To build smt like that? No permissions?
hmm smart guy has a bunker... i need a bunker
Everybody who ever has dug a hole in such firm and clay-y ground knows how much work this is. I tip my hat to you furze, that amount of dedication is amazing, even for somebody with dedication-levels like you have.
Give me this man's cocaine.
So cool but a simple hand breaker hammer used in demolition with a scaling chisel would have been more efficient... and simple.
Minecraft in real life.
spends over a year time lapsing stuff to make a video only to be released months later, what a fucking legend...
I'm really courious about the hidden cave! What a project!
u definitely need the help of the primitive guys
12:16 what music is this? It's not listed in description and shazam gives wrong answers.
Not a secret anymore 😂
Since you are underground now you like can't hear anything from the outside.  Close the hatch and silence.
This is so cool but with more than 1 million people watching it's properly not a secret anymore.
Crazy video, this is the best I've seen
Wait, my Capitol is at risk?! I aren't even playing EE...
Here the US that would make a great tornado shelter.
Should have just hired some former inmates, they'll dig you that tunnel in half the time for a quarter of the pay. Practice makes perfect after all
"I need to avoid sound to keep this tunnel a secret". Posts creation video on one of the largest youtube channels in the world.
SECRET TUNEEEL, SECRET TUNEEEEEL, THROUGH THE MOUNTAIN, SECRET TUNEEL
2020: Lockdown  so Colinfurze let's Rock in down
Do you need a building permit for that or is it considered too minuscule of a change to your property and is except like a small fish pond?
It would be interesting to know what the background radiation and oxygen level are like in the tunnel. Could you add as bonus content?
The wait is good but worth it
https://youtu.be/cnHtxIu0Jvc
0:40 are you serious? No wheelbarrow? 🤦
Is this legal?
It seems to me that Colin Furze's neighbors would be more likely to notice it's too quiet than too loud.
Watching you dig with nothing holding up the walls made me nervous lol. I’m glad you didn’t have a collapse though.
6:36 those noises were a surprisingly adequate explanation
The madness of not finishing this under lockdown makes me wonder if the neighbors are asshats
You are fuckin nuts and I love it
Minecraft but irl
Would be a bit awkward if his neighbours watched his vids :0
It took colin a lot longer than expected to build a robot to dig for him 😂
You know your crazy when you are having a party for digging a hole
Sooo.....colin furze, why did you not build a massive dirt conveyor?
1.8mil people know about this operation. is it still secret
This guy just fucks around and posts it on YouTube for a living
Capitol is at risk? Quick rally round we must protect London.  Eeeh, maybe later
How are you gonna sell this property later?
This is the most elaborate way for furze to show off his shoe collection.
It’s definitely not secret anymore LoL
Powerful!
"secret" 😂😂😂😂
What happened to that crack and the draft?
4:00 Jaime Lannister cameo
Do you have a wife? 😂😂
So what happened with the crack? Where was the wind coming from? I'm digging this project!
Colin Finds Possible Cave...   wait i've seen this movie...    Colin Finds a Dragon in;  3   2    1
I reckon old matey boy here needs to keep digging down until like forever?
I can do it faster than him only in a few minutes         In mincraft :v
Can we all take a moment to remember the tunnellers of ww1 who did this with bombs dropping over them, dealing with rats and the enemy and all for their country
You are A MadMan.........................> :O
what the heck have I stumbled upon lol
Love the great escape technique. A favourite film of mine
Hi Colin. I follow your projects and I like them.  I have a challenge.  Could you make a frame of power armor from fallout 4?
Colin Chapo
Do the English authorities require some sort of permit to dig an underground tunnel beneath your property? I wonder because in some countries you need to submit many forms and pay a considerable amount of money to get a permit for a new balcony or to set up a wall in your house.
wtf did I just see
You are à crazy man
why not build a hydraulic auger?
it's not secret if you tell everyone about it
build a railway with mine cart)
If nobody stops him, in 10 years Colin will have a rocket silo in his garden
That not a secret anymore hahaha
i waiting for part 3
Y are u digging this much 🤔 What is the use of it Still u are great
1:00 you must hate your back...
😱😱 what ?! https://youtube.com/shorts/JTb-2YWVRXg?feature=share
crazy amount of work involved in that, next level this !! proper youtube :)
Colin: Im digging a tunnel  Elon:👀
I love how he not just bought some crazy mansion with his success but instead goes absolutely nuts with home improvements xD
colin just casually prepping for ww3 and getting paid for doing it lol
I think the only logical thing after that would be to connect all the makers with tunnels, first nationally and then internationally
that certainly explains why he hasnt uploaded anything in a while xD
British John wick over here
Send me ur PayPal gril hhhhhhh
El Chapo would be proud
This is awesome but am I the only one wondering about the legality of this? I would imagine there would be lots of paperwork and inspections for something like this.
Could of just dug another hole and put the soil down there.
Just omagine he starts to dig at that hole  where wind is blowing , and he makes entire mineshaft
epic !!!!!
If you're ever going to leave that place, I would like to be informed 😉👍
*secret* tunnel - 1.8 million views
The best bit of the whole video is the fact Tom Lamb can actually sort of play the trumpet!
Not so secret tho.. It's on youtube in details... Still love you!
He's a mad lad and no question.
Today I discovered that Colin wears Calvin Klein brand tighty-whiteys. The things you learn on this channel.
we had first tornado in czech republic  so you will be safeer then if something craze hapens where you live
9:36 you could have said we hit rock bottom
it's not really secret if 1,857,216 people   have  seen it now is it , ddddd, love the vids btw
Bro u r revealing your secret tunnel to the world and giving title *Secret Tunnel*😂😂😂
Curious to see how you brace going sideways. The potential for collapse would freak me out.
The thief are taking notes 📝
remember 811 to call before you dig
This video was inspired by Minecraft
Cant believe millions watched a guy dig. Good job
Minecraft IRL
Its not secret if you announce it.
That pneumatic soil mover thing looks like it's off a fire engine. So dose the wall stabilizer thing and the winch system
When you’re digging a secret tunnel but it’s the second video on trendy  Sad secret tunnel noises
Dude really playing irl Minecraft
get some ventilation down there so this isn’t the last Colinfurze project 😂
Love your humour
Did you have to get permission to do that digging here in the states we do
ColinFurze could be irl Batman at this point lmao
Been here since your wall of death videos your channel has came a long way congrats
Arne Saknussemm.
Can you imagine if he sold the house and didn't tell the owners
Wow what a project you have there.  More power to you  Absolutely love your channel    Way to do your Sponsor promo  Great attitude  very creative
Colin Furze is my spirit animal...
Saddam hussein's hiding place
Completely missed the opportunity to use a load of secondhand treadmills to move quantities of dirt out.
https://youtu.be/vBvDWU0lCJI
SEECREET TUNNELLLLLLL
Would love to do something like that. it rains too much here though. Also too close to the ocean
I wish i had a bunker
This probably one of the zombie bunker in future
There really should be more great escape gags, love it!
The best base
He’s just becoming Rick Sanchez
😂 legend respect GGG unit family boss subscribe people epic content
aaa this is what i love about ya, the bunker was what made me start follow
This guy has big ideas!!!!
Colin is a child with the capability and materials he needs to make whatever he wants.   And we all want to be this man
Stupid question: is that legal?
you are so much more chipper than I would ever be... digging.
How did you permission for this
What more can this man make?
20 stones of muscle later....
it was necessary to come up with a conveyor belt for the soil !! or to come up with a hydro pipe !! turn the soil into mud, and then suck up the pipe to the top
when I was a child (5) me and my friend decided to dig a tunnel to the other side of the earth. So we started digging in a field. We gave up after 20 cm depth.
10:40 found yourself an old chinese drift mine :P
This is how resident evil labs are made!
Not so secret....... 10M subs......
could use all the earth to make a rammed earth house... :P  hope your keeping an eye out for any quartz seams, maybe find yourself some AU. You should ask jeff williams for some mine digging tips
This guy is probably loaded and he still likes in a average family house and has a fairly scrappy workshop???
Not a very secret tunnel considering 1.8 million people know about it
Well THAT'S  something you don't see every day...
Well it's not secret anymore
Surely someone from the council is going to turn up and ruin the fun
Digging secret tunnel rule #001 - Don't show it on youtube!
Lmfao was that the Great Escape ? I dont know the name of the movie I did see it however.
Colin doesn't want his neighbours to know about it, but publishes a full HD video evidence of him digging a tunnel. Nice.
Does his house not have foundations?
JUST BEATUFUL!!!!!!
how do you spell ''hydraulic injection injury''? colin: yes
I cant image jow your back works after that little shovel
What about that crack?
careful of your wrists this really can fuck them up for a while if you aren't manually laboring as a digger on the usual.
And while I’m watching this I get an alert from another YouTuber reviewing ditch witch vacuum powered excavator. Interesting I must go watch that now.
*Secret*
12:16 sweet sequence
AdkkhehtSruq
Do that where I live and it would fill up with water in no time!
The danish invader? Daaaansk!!!
Sorry Colin, end of sponsor 6:14.
Your totally making a bat cave i.e. furze cave
2 ON TRENDING!!!!!!!!!! GG
How to build a SECRET tunnel and show it online to 1,8 Mio. people. What a secret.
Someone's going to look at all of this in 100 years and wonder, why?
Dont let the Stasi catch you
If you used a guller, it would have helped aloy
Stop digging! you're going to wake up the Balrog!
Finding Saddam Hussein gaming bunker
YouTube. Not so secret.
Not so secret now is ir
I have simply no words for this.....
the neighbors watching this like 👁👄👁
looks like its a elivator
A secret underground tunnel to my 11million subscribers🤫
7:45 hydraulicality
Just love your vids keeps me sane, well sort of.
9:30. He literally hit rock bottom
23:59:We need a quiet system 00:00: Starts machining
"I know what you're thinking" Why are you wearing a dress shirt and tie while you are digging a huge hole? "Where am I gonna put all this?"
Biggest legend in England
Every time I see a video by colin I think at some point: "ehh, that looks kinda dangerous". Before he put the steel cage inside I was starting to worry if that tunnel was gonna collapse at some point.
He needs a like after all that dedication
Not that secret tho
I tried this in my yard a few years ago. Got 12' down and hit blue clay. Stopped my project in its tracks. I will now live vicariously through Colin!
Mine mine minecraft ( :
Every build video is extraordinary <3
I do hope you put in some kind of evil genius elivator to get down the shaft !
This dude is still living my best life.
If I did this at my home in Florida I would have a swimming pool by now. Lol
Most youtubers: Earning money while sitting on a chair and reacting to other videos.  Colin:
Me: wow this is the ultimate lockdown project Colin: does nothing with it during lockdown
Colin is playing minecraft in real life
Why does the freetrade link flag as a phishing link?
Next projekt. Secret tunnel to China💥🎶
See you in a year and a half when you start digging again
Super cool.  I love it.
how much is your electricity bill at the end of the month?
Anyone taking bets he's going to eventually make his own particle accelerator? Or neighborhood subway?! Too bad Collin doesn't live near the northern Mexican / southern U.S. border or it might be done already.  :-P  "Turning the Internet up to 11..." - ha! The scale goes to 100! Just kidding. Love the Channel. -- I'm "digging" it. :-D
"i am digging a secret underground tunnel" More than 1.8 million views...
I’m amazed at how he can literally dig a tunnel through rock and soil and not even get a single stain on his shirt
Damn man, you really are nuts! lol
12:16 Song?
5:30 wtf im new to this channel and I’m fucking weirdet out ;-;
3:10 Incredible! It's an oversized trowel!
Can someone please explain UK planning laws? 😆
colin is basically what my dream was when i was 8. lucky.
How did your water company let you dig this??!?!
https://youtu.be/10QeucNXfbg
where are all the comments about the crack? where did the crack go to bro?
id hate to be the guy who buys that kellogs box full of dirt
Did you discover your own bat cave?
Diggin a secret tunnel. Video gets 2million views. Not so secret Colin not so secret at all :p
You must have the most understanding council planning department in the entire country.
Not really that secret if you post it online
Interesting
Super excited to see your progress! Hard work but you won't let that stop you!🍻
never dig straight  down
Atleast now if you sold the house it would add value with the bunker attached to the house!
"The Danish Invader" That's us!
next video: *Trying to escape the police, after building a secret tunnel to the bank, with my jet bycycle!*
I wonder what  movie the scene at 1:38 is from
How come he’s done all that digging, and yet his shirt and tie are immaculate? Come on Colin, own up, you’ve got your wife doing the digging haven’t you? You clever little breaker of sexist stereotypes, no misogyny in your home, Mr Modern Man.
Ehm, what can't you do man?
i love how despite his age he still mischief.. 1:59
2:08 Denmark!
*@colinfurze* 12:40 You should get a CO2 measure thingy, because I think the air circulation down in that hole can become really bad & dangerous.
I'm surprised you didn't over engineer a conveyor system into a skip or something
I’ll see all those in 30 years when this is your number 1 recommended at 2:43 am
Secret entrance... 1.8m views 🙃
But what about the cave!?
I swear  this guy can survive zombie apocalypse like hella safe
You need to make sure this is shored properly. A cave in could kill you.
Oh when the saints come marching in~
This guy is a maniac. A brilliant maniac.
VIEWER: What about permits? FURZE: Permits? We ain't got no permits. We don't need no permits. I don't have to show you any stinkin' permit!
If it wasn't for copyright issues, you should be playing Mudvayne during the video
I've dug up enough for a small garden and it was hard work.. I can't imagine the work involved to dig a whole that big.
A legend
days later, colin finds a dinosaur
Hahaha.. Ask the terrorists of Hamas how to dig a tunnel and die there. Hahahahaahhahahaaha
That crack is pretty fascinating, not gonna lie. I'd be super curious where it connects to the surface to get that breeze.
Arent there some sort of registrations of how low you are allowed to dig?
*@colinfurze* 2:50 Make the shovels Telescopic instead, so it can always be whatever length you NEED it to be :D
It’s all fun and games until someone buries themselves alive
I’m waiting for it !!!!
١
Good place to hide in the end of the world
I saw another guy on the tube hand dig out a basement. He recommended an SDSMax Drill with a spaded chisel attachment. Though smaller I guess maybe not much quieter than the breaker but maybe different noise frequency doesn’t carry as far. I admire your effort and positive approach - intriguing project!
my man is preparing for the apocalypse
Use dynamite 🧨 🤩
Colin is the true liveaction  minecraft steve
song at 12:19 ?
I always wonder after watching a great video on youtube. How is there dislikes on this video!!!? How, what didn't you like that 16k people missed?
👍
You had better think about some ventilation down there if you are going to put machinery in the bottom, even if none of it is internal combustion.
dig a SECRET tunnel and upload it on youtube. fantastic !!
Colinfuze you are crazy man 😁
https://youtu.be/MFzJLr0fxCQ
hold up hes recording and broadcasting a secret tunnel video to millions of people? counter intuitive?
I guess all that beach hut digging practice came in useful here.
do you have planning permission for this?
Plot twist: You accidentally dig into your neighbour's secret tunnel ;P
Collin: *builds a secret tunnel* Also collin: *shows it to millions of people on youtube*
What’s up with those neighbors? Is there anything wrong with making noise during the day?
atleast one of us got their exercise during lockdown
Is he allowed to do that? I mean, by the laws of god ?
So I was thinking elevator. That ladder looks tiring and I’m lazy.
It put the lotion on its skin, it does this when its told.
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Hope you don't stumble across some unexploded ordinance....
How did you get council approval for this aye?! :O
Secret Tunnel Secret Tunnel, through the garden, secret secret secret secret tunnel
This might be the best channel on yt uno
Is it still secret if there's a video of its location-?
Colin "epic minecraft".
So secret it appears on the discovery tab
*The Cartel Liked This*
Colins friend looks like notch and neighbours must gove some trouble
I hope he actually left a box of cereal filled with dirt in the shop
next week,  10 lucky viewers finish the digging for me with a lifetime of free "bunker party" invitations
I'm subscribing just to see what happens next lol
The work that you put in this video is wild.
What about a Furze tunnel boring machine to quietly dig a tunnel?
El Chapo liked this
Don't the neighbours have YouTube?
Чувак, ты безумец )))) очень круто!!!
Какой грунт хороший, воды нет, стены не осыпаются, только копать заебешся
and Colin discovers a windy sinkhole beneath his shed
Just Unbelievable 💥💥💥
SECRET TUNNEL!!! THROUGH THE GARDEN!!!
Does working with a neck tie make the task easier or faster. ? I wonder.
were you worried about possibly finding old ww2 unexploded ordinance?
just build a TBM
Make sure you light up the tunnel or monsters would spawn in the tunnel
Colin; digging a secret tunnel Camera; you kidding me right??😂
I can’t believe you have been holding onto this video for over a year!
Saddam Hussein meme
this is where saddam hussein is buried
I once explored Cold War era bank vault for the war cash reserve of a country. The building on top was modelled as an office and bomb proof with a huge fence made so 1 big truck could drive inside the office and afterwards drive out the other side. All compartimentalized so driver could leave truck there to be filled and later get in at other side. There was an artificial lake beside it rigged with explosives and a mirrors around the vault arranged so you could see your own back. Beneath was a atomic shelter intended for the guards with a secret escape tunnel coming out at the other end of the industrial area.  The procedure for the guards was a bit unsettling: most guards went inside but 1 guard had to stay outside guarding the vault during an atomic blast. Because he would become contaminated he would not be allowed inside of the shelter and would in his dying hours be responsible for disposing of the contaminated clothing of the other guards.
and people wonder how el chapo could dig so many tunnels with a couple thousand people helping
Why do you care so much about your neighbors quietness. I bet you’re one of the best neighbors out there lol
aint that secret anymore
Local council: hold up! You need build planning and the go ahead from us!
Dude, I swear I feel 12 again, #dreamsofaboy
How about a little room down there to hide some projects if you need to🤔
3:14 - why I love this channel!
Very inefficient
Did you find out where the crack was or where it led to? Seems bizarre to have airflow that deep !
Give your neighbours an offer they can't refuse...for their house
How long before you regretted not using gloves? I am guessing day 2 as someone that regularly does repetitive labor
Did you have to get planning permission? If so how did that get approved
La cha🍕 has entered the chat
the next owners of the house be like: kid - "mom there is an underground secret tunnel here" mom - "our kid has such a great imagination" father "no there is an actual underground tunnel here, should we call the police or something" mom - "..."
Lets be honest here colin dosent need to be quiet to make it sneaky. Making a crap ton of noise is quite normal for him.
Have you ever  thought  what will you do if water raised?
Colin would be an amazing back robber or prison escapee with all this ramming and digging
Saddam Hussein's hiding place be like:
Get an engineer in there. That bit if mesh and tubing is not going to hold back all of that earth.

He’s worried about his neighbours knowing and yet he’s putting it on youtube
1:35 😲
OMG its a so cool Projekt 👍🏻
Lol you crazy
https://youtu.be/S9RQePqGK3s💥🔥🔥🔥
Duuuuuuuuuude, this is sick !!! Awesomeness at its apogee !
So heavy lifting to do if you wanna dig hole under excisting house than building freshly new house but bdigging hole before house.
This man is living my childhood dream
How do u get away with this without alerting 📢 HEALTHY & SAFETY,  LOCAL COUNCIL AND PLANNING PERMISSION? IN ENGLAND They will just tell you to revert all that work back to the way if previously was
1:58 I can only wish he did not come back and pick it up after ending the shot
Hey give me that soil
Who else skipped
I love his accent (I used to love doctor who with a passion) Also the project is pure inner child stuff and that 100% up my alley.
An A++ for the comedy
So the underground lair begins
@colinfurze  do you like skateboarding? try something with that^^
Mini Belt Conveyor system for quick dirt removal could maybe work, ease the work load a little
Isn't that incredibly dangerous without shoring up the sides properly?
As much as I loved the bit... I'm still desperate to know... Where's the dirt going?? 😂 Oh and... You're mad Xx
It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the house again
At this point Colin's house is basically my house in Sims 4
At the neighbours: Her: honey Colin is up to something again and he wants to keep it a secreet.  Him: just wait for the youtube video.
What is wrong with 800ppl who watch this?
That Jackhammer is the OG Hitachi magic Wand :P
you know, the best cover you have for this project is that your neighbours are used to all kinds of crazy sounds and power tools and things coming out of your garage and won't think anything unusual is happening.
going to be a big hit to youtube when you get caved in
10:55 : Minecraft Basebuild be like...
**This is Fab.** I have been watching for years by my self at home then one day walked in to my kids room and fond out that both my 8 and 10 year old watch you too
U could make a conveyor belt to move the dirt out
not so secret now is it
Wow an elevator to go in the tunnel would be so so cool …
I cant wait for part 3 😁
now the tunnel is not secret
you should put a decibel meter on the screen and in the shed
Was ist schlimmer als ein Elefant im Porzellanladen?  Ein Igel in der Kondomfabrik!
This looks so much like the batcave from batman begins
Freetrade doesn't work. You can't load money onto it, it just doesn't work. They basically harvest your details and then it goes no further.
ma una trivella no?
BORING!
Digging a secret tunnel and publish on social media...so nobody knows about it...good idea
Stick a corkscrew in there to pile down
damn forget sound absorbing foam pads, just dig a hole in the ground, sounds great
I bet you'll saddam hussein there in the tunnel
Collin should be in an orchestra
where did all the soil go sure some one would notice
I would have made the head of the ram a lot larger to displace a larger amount of clay
How in the hell did you gain council approval to do this? lol
Dear Colin    What you need is a "core drill" Drill out long cores and just break away the stuff in between with hydraulik power machines !  Ofc you also need a certified surveyor to help you with the directions, so you get to the right spot, I'll happily come help you with that!
Hahha strange piles of dirt appears in Stamford
Tom is a pretty great character.
Not that secret anymore now is it
This is why Colin is britian's premier mad scientist.
Can you show the hulkbuster again pls
My back is hurting from watching this...
I think this is my favourite project that I've seen on the tube so far.
I just think is this illegal
he better hire those guys who everyone watches at 2 am, building pools and underground palaces
1:51 lol
An average person tries this. They Hit the water table.
“Idk where that crack goes too” “The crack is getting deeper” That’s what she said 😂
Mad house ;D
World biggest secret 😂
TV show
I feel like this was every child's dream
😍👍♥️🇵🇱
Hi Collins, tell me, would your CNC plasma cutter also work with 8mm aluminum and how good does the cutting edge then look? Because a laser or water jet cutter is still far beyond my financial means ;-) Thanks for your help and greetings from Bavaria, Martin (my project: www.scuttler.eco-warrior.de)
definitely not practicing to rob a bank, nothing to see here!
Digging a secret tunnel   Trending #3 today  Secret.
The guy who bought a pack of cereals but got dirt
I'm reminded of when Fred Dibnah dug a brick-lined replica 70 foot deep mine-shaft and steam-powered lift winding engine in his back garden, with a drift tunnel to come out in the steep side of the stream gully besides his property. He encountered a few planning permission issues half way through...  There are videos on YouTube of that epic endeavour.
you're an animal colin lol love it
You should dig into your neighbors yard!!! XD
Cool project but AWFUL music, in the beginning that is
Epic
I'm speechless, just commenting for the algorithm lol this is crazy
I remember when Fred Dibnah started to dig a mine shaft in his garden to show how it was done, it didn't take long for the council to stop him because he didn't have planning permission. I miss that guy.
Making a secret tunnel to his bunker      Uploads it to youtube😂
Such an awesome project!!!!! Can't wait for the next installment!!!!!!! Careful of the mole people though Colin!!!
Absolute madlad ❤️🔥
Sooo, every one around you,   firstly!  Has been hearing you do strange shit at all hours since you started youtube, why would what you are doing now be any different??  Secondly  Most importantly   Dont all the folks around you watch your videos??   If even one of em does the gig is up!  Still I suppose it keeps you out of trouble! Or. In it. What ever makes you happy!
Mate, your insane but amazing 👍👍👍
Amazing dedication
This guy has 11 million subscribers, yet he works in a tiny shed! lol
The dedication of this man makes me smile.
I've dug a lot of holes in my work over the years, everytime I do I always feel like I'm time travelling. I wonder when was the last time this earth saw the light of day, have humans ever seen this rock before?
love it
Really what is this guy planning for?
Why not connect the garage to the tunnel system?
My dude Colin's gonna fall into a lava pit if he proceeds to dig in a straight line downwards
9:30 We hit bedrock
If he was my father, I'd be playing hide n seek with friends and I am gonna hide in the bunker
9:37  .. you could say, you "Hit rock bottom" .. your welcome.
The Philza of real life
12:16 The last track is not listed in the intro heading, does any one know the title?
Put a smoke bomb in there.
You either REALLY care about your neighbors or you... didn't get permission to do this, did you? XD
On another YouTube video I saw a guy use a coring drill to great success to dig a room out of sandstone. Looks like it would be pretty successful here to ? or some other kind of saw to cut slots and lever out chunks ?
Well it’s not a secret tunnel anymore
Title should read man tunnels from UK  to Australia breaking covid travel restrictions! 😂
You should start Collin tours
I think Joseph fritzl would approve. Its a shame he is not available for advice.
The average time a stock is held by the buyers is about 6 seconds.
13:41 I have that power lead extender!!!
When he Pulled out the pump, I thought that real quiet doesn't
Nobody   Literally no body   This guy Preparing things for dooms day
The amount of time he puts into each video
What did you do to prevent rust from happening with all that square-tubing framing?  Anyways, this project is AWESOME!!!! *looks forlornly at my own backyard to see if I can make an underground bunker.  Nope..*
You have to upload your national insurance number just to sign up to the sponsor app no thanks
Confined space, loud machinery and no ear protection, ouch.
El CHapo would be proud
Colin Furze "Tunnel King" 👑
y r Mental love you ideas and vids
Coco pops, high in minerals.
You are right in calling it a malarkey. 👍
"2 men in a shed" the new hit drama series
Only colin furze could make digging a hole complicated!
A low-cost way to Increase Sales for your small business with this app. This app only costs $3.
For gods sake, make a hydraulic auger drill to loosen the soil and vacuum the dirt out
By the way Colin, are you expecting some sort of cataclysm to hide for?
Isn't this illegal??
Look up how they dig out basements in london.. use a conveyorbelt.
Please send a GoPro down the Crack. I want to know where is it going
Is this legal? ;)
Anyone else thinking He will make a box push it in with the hydralics then excavate the dirty just like they were doing 200 years ago on the london underground?
Why don’t you get a post hole digger to make larger holes quickly and easier then just remove loose soil
Atleast as you start to dig further sideways you could start using heavy equipment again as it would be largely muffled through the ground
I have been trying to convince my wife that as our house is on a slope that we could easily dig down and put storage under the back of our house
Why is my "Capitol" at risk? Must be an American thing.
why not have some sort of sound barrier (on the hatch) to greatly reduce the noise and keep on using a jack hammer?
YES ITS ON TRENDING WOOOOO
He needs to hire El Chapo’s crew.
You look like loki in the thumbnail... Or rather he looks like u....
You've got enough clay there to start your own Pottery Business Colin! ❤️👍😂
El Chapo
you created a confined space environment and appear to not have any confined space entry plan in place (atmospheric gas detection, fall arrest, standby and rescue person etc), this is how people die.
So Colins neighbours don't subscribe to his YouTube?
you gotta quit smoking dude
For the horizontal digging you could make a rotary bucket scoop mounted on a hydraulic ram, take it slow with very high torque for quite and efficient digging. Not sure it's the cheapest option, but it would be fun to see how you went about it.
El Chapo hole
Next video leak: I made a secret underground helicopter hangar in my backyard.
Do you need a bunker?  Colin: yes but a small one
Its Capital, not Capitol - a Capitol is like London :)
He the hell do you get a permit for this in the UK?
why not use an auger.... lmao
If there was a zombie apocalypse survivors team, I would want Colin in it!!
This is legit the coolest thing anyone has ever done on YouTube
1,6 Million People see this Video after 19 hours. Colinfurze: SECRET TUNNEL
https://youtu.be/1tlSB162kns
post hole diggers would have made a better start
That tie certainly helped you dig faster
The lack of concern demonstrated for delamination collapse, noxious gas build up, structural collapse, water consideration, and overall soil integrity management is astonishing. I say demonstrated, because you may have considered it and not shown or described it. I want to stress that I want to see you finish your shed version of "The Greatest Escape". Keep at it, just don't disregard safety completely, work hard and stay safe.
just incredible, to have the balls to do this is just great. however, is there not a risk of hitting sewerage pipes, or the like? i guess they are all out the front under the roads...?
You totally need to make a Hogan's Hero's reference with the tunneling somewhere.  That is freaking EPIC!
Some day, you should record the faces of the officials at the planning authority when you submit one of your crazy projects 🤣
This will never work in Florida lol.
I've been watching you for years Colin and I  think your MAD, really Colin you need help medical help
There a song for this: WIND ROSE - Diggy Diggy Hole (Official Video) | Napalm Records  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34CZjsEI1yU
Secret bunker is not...you famous..all people see that
secret tunnel! secret tunnel!
Okay, the digging was nice and all, but that Lockdown-match-cut-compilation was awesome!
If you had this project through lockdown I bet you barley noticed how long were we're actually in lockdown for 😂 My project was restoring my grandads car and time flew when I started working on it, barely realised it'd been 8 months before news of the lockdown easing came about
You spelt Capital wrong.
Wayyy you have made a whopping 6 bucks from this video WOOOO OR something like that
is it realy secret with over 1.5 mill people knows about it
This is minecraft, but in real life
Colin really is the weirdest guy ever but I still love em with all my CRAZYNESSSSS
Gotta love Colin, always does the hard work to complete his projects
The amount of dedication and motivation you have for your projects is truly inspiring
Welcome to the youtube channel where you watch a man dig a tunnel to make a living
Is it really a secret now?
There will certainly be many job offers from the mexican cartels...
I don't think anyone would give a toss if they heard loud machinery. With all the gear you build.. Wouldn't even matter. Every now again just pull out some old invention and pretend you were just finishing it off. (I know this is old)
Colin and Brad Bellick from Prison Break are getting some process here, nice!
Totally awesome
reminds me of watching Colditz when I was a kid
Neighbours visitor: "Whats that hydraulic noise coming from the shed over there?" Neighbour: "Our crazy engineer neighbour probably built some hydraulic digging tool to connect his bunker with the shed or something weird like that..."
DigDigDig
seems more sound than the underground beach hut
What if you used something like huge screw like drill?
Never dig straight down.
Spent 12 minutes watching a mad scientist dig a hole and I loved every bit of it. Now that’s good work!
Neighbours sound like killjoys
This guy really passionate for whatever he is doing. He can be a great spiritual material for sadhguru
He's trying to dig a tunnel to EU
"Best to keep it secret", let us upload it to Youtube
a secret known to 11m people lol
Loving the tunnel videos! Try making one of those cartoony large cone drill bits with a powerful motor on one end? Also Be careful furze, we cant replace you haha.
Minecraft irl
Once Colin decides to sell his property the realtor is gonna have an interesting day
What tf? Why would YouTube recommend this to me? I must have watched something from here before? Edit: I take it back. The later half made me think it's pretty cool. But too much time wasted on neighbor judgement concerns unless laws are a factor. It's a hole, I'm pretty sure it's insulating with regards to sound
What is it about men that just makes us love digging holes?
Don't dig there, dig it elsewhere, You're digging it round when it ought to be square It's much too long and everything's wrong And you can't dig a hole where a hole don't belong.  Bernard Cribbins
Am I the only one who wouldn't care if he decides to make a video, where he builds the perfect secret hiding place for some dead bodies?
How many Roman coins so far?
SECRET TUNNEL!!
What about the windy crack (in the rock) you found? Was it a dead end?
this is so cool
Colinfurze: well looks like we can’t use any heavy equipment. *looks at shovel and assortment of tools* Colinfurze: fine I’ll do it myself
Just hire el chapo’s men
Yea, im sure the neighbors are unaware of your YouTube content :D
He literally has broken the number one rule in Minecraft
Hamas of Gaza will gladly recruit you
9:31 : Colin hitting rock bottom.
Stop acting like a fkn tool mate
hides work from people next door assumeing they dont watch his youtube videos-
You cheeky bastard 😜
5:51 : "Your Capitol is at risk" : I see what you did here...  🤣 #January6 #NeverForget
Has anyone seen the Pete & Pete episode, Grounded For Life? ;-)
What your frend name?
Me: how big is your house Colin: yes
Mr Grimsdale says he sounds like Will Young.🧐
Every kids dream was have a bunker and secret way to get in and slso its rlly awesome!
You crazy. The good crazy tho.
10:15 - Now THAT'S a Hitachi Wand.
Dig a tunnel Dig dig a tunnel  Dig a tunnel  Dig dig a tunnel Quick before the hyenas come
trombones according to YouTube: uuuuuuuuuuuhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Just need Dick and Harry to lend a hand on the job now.....
Did you download Minecraft, the live version?
The hyenas are coming 😂
How does this guy have so much energy, just watching him makes me tired.
I have this tunel to
Only a matter of time before you hit diamonds
Colin Furze = if the dangerous book for boys and ADHD had a genius offspring 🤣
Stupidity in the extreme,,, why would anyone watch this drivel
After this project can you please build a homemade tesla cybertuck❤️
Awesome video colin you are awesome and you have the gratest youtube chanel ever and my day just gott better
Oh man, excellent project, this one! Looking forward to the next video! Keep up!!
CF is living every little boys dream
He is the only guy playing minecraft in real life 😤
Neat
Lost properties gonna be full of dirt
*awesome, can you shoot your next videos in palestine?*
You are a bloody legend, love watching ya vids thanx and I can't wait to see ya next dig
The networks should totally give this guy a late night show  funny as F%$#K
09:07 at this point I'm thinking, "oh Colin, surely you would have installed an electric winch to haul up those buckets?" ...
I can't wait for the process of him selling his house.
I think it would be cool, if you interjected an episode of building some machines to make the digging easier. like mini tunnel diggers, maybe you can get sponsored by Elon's "boring company"
You're a f*cking nutter!  And I love it!
I hope I can help you nice job
You are a fuckin crazy and awesome guy!!! Go on!!!
People in the neighbour watching "buried in the backward" and suddenly they hear shovels and digging coming from your house.   Those people will be like: it's really happening gonna call the cops.
IM BOUT TO BE THE HARDEST YOUTUBER OUT 🔥🚀
https://youtu.be/jXmorqeXxz4
Cant say I've ever been as excited to see someone dig a hole as right now 😂
Hahahah I love how you hid piles of dirt all around town :D
What kind of education do you have? How did you learn to do this stuff?
Are there any geotechnical or structural engineers involved behind the scenes? Working underground is no joke, and there are so many things that can go wrong resulting in death - and it can happen in the blink of an eye.
What a legend ! Collin you are an inspiration, please another video please even if it just an update
Legend says he still digging to this day and he is ripped af
North Korea wants YOU to invade southern enemies
Sinaloa Cartel could teach you how to tunnel like a pro! Lol
Well that's a relief, I was expecting there to be a gas main running side to side right across the centre of the tunnel entrance six foot down. Just the sewer main to worry about now...  Just a thought for you, once you're under the sandstone slab, how much noise you make is irrelevant, only limited amounts of it will translate the slab into the soil above.
Have you thought about one of those new fankled barrows with a wheel at the front..  And a hydraulic shovel...  🤔👍😂
Wow!  I've always wanted something like this!
URGENT!!!  Make sure you're careful, holes like that are known to be oxygen deprivation pits, and has lead to death and brain damage many times for workers. i recommend adding ventilation into the hole, it wont take much.
Puts in perspective just how incredible the Great Escape really was.
Make a hydrolic jaw that can chew a pile of dirt
anyone else think of the scene in wallace and grommit where grommit is chasing the wererabbit through the ground and hid wipers happen to have a setting for "heavy loam"
Minecraft rendering engine got very realistic lately.
What's the name of the last song? It's amazing but I couldn't shazaam it :(
to late i skipt it
I want this guy as a neighbor
didn't think there would be noise down that far under ground for the neighbors to hear ???
this is sooo fucking epic!! oh my god I love it
3:10 >welds on paint T_T
C'mon Colin! Rotary boaring machine or bust!
Hey Use sound proof/absorbing foam
Insane!
"Secret underground tunnel" **proceeds to record the whole process for millions of people on YouTube**
How is no one else talking about the crack?!? I want to see where it goes now!
Sick...!!!🤟🏻🤟🏻🤟🏻
something so satisfying to me about him being able to weld that mesh in place super easy because even though its down in a tunnel, its basically still the shop. It feels far, but oh right you can just weld stuff without moving the welder.
😍
I've watched 5 minutes of this video. Are you out of your mind? I'm impressed.
This whole channel is every kids dream
secret tunnel: 11 mil knows!!
what happens if it rains
You think a post hole auger could could have pulled up or atleast loosened some of the soil? Where was the breeze coming from?
Council approval?
Wooooooow Coulin can be a character of casa the papel like Mosca hahaha
"ah yes that hole is getting deeper, I think Colin will need a winch or a pulley soon..."  *next shot is Colin welding on the roof*  "well whaddayaknow, it's a winch!!!"
It puts the lotion on its skin, or else it gets the hose again.
This is great haha can't wait to see it complete
bro you are mad about your life and work   💥👌👌👍👍
This guy playing Minecraft alot
1:53 and that kids, is why coco pops are brown.
i dont know why you didnt make a frame with a drill that dig and scoops up to the top.
After watching you're beach hut I know that you NOTHING about digging. Please tell me you at least consulted a professional tunneler, even if it's just someone from your fans.  And before some moron says "it's not that dangerous", I'm a site engineer and 2 of the 3 major injuries that have occurred on sites I work on have been digging related, a guy in a 4 foot trench had a side fall in as a clay sheet on the side of his leg, legs aren't meant to bend that way and the other guy cut corners and got buried alive, fortunately it wasn't much and with people around they dug him out with only some broken ribs and the life scared out of him.  And the "Colin does loads of dangerous things" I hate to break your fantasy but nothing else Colin has done is particularly dangerous.
I know damn well not to dig straight down. Might fall to a Lava. Try putting Efficency V on your tool to dig faster too, maybe upgrade to Diamond tools too.
Yes #minecraft
Next video : nukeproofing my bunker Next video : enriching plutonium  Next video : making a rocket  Next video :  oh you won't survive to see it
didn't you already have a hydraulic system thingy in your shed?
m i n e c r a f  t
This guy is the only person that made me watch the full sponsor
Free trade don't. Invest with vanguard and their indexes to get actual returns.
I thought for a moment that the old footage of the compressor was being used to fill a gap. The penny dropped when I realised it was to basically date the build. Colin, you sneaky, sneaky man!
Get them guys from primitive with sticks, easy work for them 😂
It looks like a mine shaft
I use freetrade, it's decent.
Next up Colin builds a secret underground fortress with working lava filled moat and draw bridge.
Careful you don’t fall in lava!
Could of made a hydraulic grabber, lowers down and grabs a munch of earth then cables back up and across for unloading.
Was the beach hut dig practice for this?
every little boys dream
Wouldn't blasting have been an alternative?
OMG….
Colin can I suggest a large drill then do half a dozen holes then cut away at it the scrap around them. Just moving a foot at a time, might be quicker. If you it your hydraulic system, with more torque than speed might work better. it will probably be quicker than chipping away at it.
A thought with your wedge. Would a screw work better at clearing?
Hate to say it, but at the moment, it looks like Buffalo Bills' prisoner pit in Silence of the Lambs. ('Put the lotion in the basket...')
didn’t the shed already have a hydraulic pump?
😂
F
Man's gonna get ripped by the end of this
The value of this house 😂
This is giving off serious Batman vibes.
Dude this is epic I want this in my yard!!!
Hahah yeeaaah! Good job buddy
That band bit was hysterical
I was certain you were going to create some tunnel/shaft boring machine, cannot believe you just manually dug it all out!! Update ....carried on watching past the sponsor nonsense and boom, that's more like it!! :-)
Omg I absolutely love ur videos and. Interesting inventions u do. And u are super smart. And have and know alot of knowledge. Would be awesome to have ur brain. As I aren't. Smart or creative as you  I hope. U stay and live. For a very long. Time. Indeed. I can't wait til u finish this tunnel. Project. Its gonna be awesome
"Secret" project - 1.5mln views so far
He furzed the shovel🤣
Hi Colin, it's your neigbour here, I subscribed to your channel years ago, I know what you're up to😁
Idk what kind of drugs colin takes to remain so active .
4s
Many years ago, I asked the wife, if I could put a shipping container, under where I was planning on building my workshop.  The answer was no.  As you can see, I wear the trousers in "her" house 😂😂
epic love it need one so bad thanks for greatness
El chapo would be proud.
this is stupid
Hilarious
Imagine going to a Waitrose and buying that "cereal" box.
I was waiting for a huge digging timelapse during 2020 covid outbreak. Nothing else to do but dig, I thought :(
colinfurze here fulfilling all our childhood reams
Can't wait for my grand children to start a ghost town living cave exploration channel in colins old house in 50 years
Nice Great Escape reference!
Reminds me a little of Fred dibnahs mind shaft dig in his back garden. “ dig with dibnah”
SECRET TUNNELLLLL - IFKYK
Isambard Kingdom Brunel used hydraulic rams to tunnel under the Thames. Shame that the project is covert else explosives would cut down on the work : )  ....DA.
Colin, you need to employ a pair of Cambodian builders to complete your project. The use only primitive hand tools and get it done in no time 😉
Real life batman
The awesome boot unsurprisingly fold because cry enthrallingly ruin about a fallacious larch. electric, disastrous clarinet
Yo! Rly big project! You need one special tool for beeing faster with this! Its called "Air spade" its a air pressure powerd spade!
You can't tell us there's a secret chamber where air is coming in and then not reveal the secret chamber!
"Your capitol is at risk"
I would be so afraid of any tunnel collapsing after a rain
you installed a hydraulic pump in an earlier video
This reminds me of better call Saul
Am I the only one that wants to know what pipe he broke to find that “crack”
LOL HE DID #minecraft ye s my guy
at least its not on the beach with all the sand caving like that three-story under beach house you did few years back
Colin you already have a hydraulic pump in the corner far left corner of your Bench
Part 3 pliss
4:50 bit late to the party but good to see Col raising awareness about the Washington Insurrection.
ColinFurze just might be crazy but it's a good kind of crazy and I think it's just what we need especially at the moment.
You're insane and I love that
It's not really a secret underground tunnel when everybody on YouTube knows
Funtastik
Colin being like jack sparrow for a video  "Ive got a jar of dirt!"
Is it  secret tunnel if I know where it is?
Haircut looked fresh 👌🏻
“Your capitol is at risk” _AMERICA has entered the chat_
Was that Dr. Mallard?? 😲
i reckon the old bill might have something to say about leaving suspicious bags in pubs Col...
The day when Colin sells that house, the new owners are going to be like: wtf was the old owner up to.
Chances of Colin Furze silently tunnelling into your house are small, but never zero.
Right now, it looks like you're starting your own iron mine.
Colin is easily my favorite YouTuber. The genuine joy he has speaks large volumes
i dont understand why you put #minecraft tho
Super cool as usual Colin!  Why do I get the impression you have new neighbors that are more sensitive to noise...  Still glad to see you doing amazing things!  I'm curious, do the tunnels need any kind of planning permission?
Does anyone know the name of the song used at 12:16?
I'm getting Batman Begins vibes.
To think that this Colin would dig through endless amounts of soil just for a youtube video and having a good living AND also wearing a suit. Thats dedication right there.
i thought videos had got less frequent. turns out it takes far more than building a tank to keep you busy, you were also vietconging your garden again.
OMFG
You've got all the tools. Could you make a candy drop roller?
Looks like he needs Mexicans to finish faster 😎
What about the cave? Where was the draft coming from? Maybe it was a sinkhole?
Sooner or later you will find a T-Rex - hello hello hello I am stuck in a tyrannosaurus rex! please help, i repeat please help.......
Sir you adison👍🌹🌹
*NEVER DIG STRAIGHT DOWN!*
nice one but i am shock that he did not make his own tunnel boring machine LOL :P
Colin playing 7 Days to Die, IRL
pog
Epic
Jeeez, this guy has wayy to much energy, i love it
Why didn't you just make a large screw like you did for your screw tank and then use that to drill into the dirt? You could have probably figured out a way to place it inside of a tube so that it would bring the dirt up to the top for you and either deposit it directly into buckets which you simply swapped back and forth or onto a conveyor belt which then fed it directly outside to the truck you were dumping the dirt into. Once you drilled out enough holes then the dirt between the holes would have collapsed and you could have then had a far faster and easier time of it.
Imagine what people will think then furze eventually sells his house lol. This channel never ceases to amaze me
Put tho soil in wheel carts
I think u did lots of exercise
"Secret Tunnel" Well Right now it's #3 Trending soooooo Not secret anymore lol
Looks like you need help from those guys that dig and make secret, hidden temples with swimming pools.  :)
Damn, this is very secretive
Where did the crack lead to?
So this project started BEFORE Covid.  A whole year of lockdown and working from home and he made almost zero progress....  This seems like prime digging time missed.
MOREEEEEEEEE
It's not a secret anymore.
After watching this I had to go back through your older videos to spot giveaway signs of this project.
Coming up: People en mass getting submerged in their gardens trying to do the same =D
it's like he know the world is coming to an end
huh so no foundation is laid under the house?
This just keep getting better 😂
"Colin Furze - Turning the internet up to 11 since 2006!" Hard to believe it's been 15 years
Colin's Wife must be so chill to be okay with projects like this.. 😂
So what did that draft end up being? Also I'm certain it's giving you so much respect for the prisoners of the great escape who built their own tunnels while under captivity. All that dirt to get out and there's only so many places to put it.
Colin you absolute madlad
COLIN’S NEIGHBOURS HEARS REALLY BAD MUSIC: “Yep he’s definitely up to something”
Whoever buys his house some day will have a crazy surprise
"I don't want to make any noise" ... Make a fuckton of noise making weird tools.
Tom is such a character he should appear more often haha
It cannot be overstated just how hard digging is, especially in dense pete.
And you thought Minecraft was hard.
He knows
Id have to be on acid to dig out a underground bunker by hand
I keep hearing "engineers hate him" in my head
why doesn't colin just build a mini mining drill or something?
Colin you are absolutely brilliant! So twisted.  I love it
This project has been so long in the making didn’t even have the hydraulic on the shelf yet
ducky
f me, who ya going to eventually sell your house to?
There are tools out front of home depot that can help you bro
I love the idea that at some point in the future an estate agent is going to get to sell a house with features including “secret bunker and underground tunnels”.
Why isnt he wearing a mask in a supermarket? Great influence.
Good luck trying this in Holland. 6" and your ankle deep in water 😂
By hand ? Crazy kids
And so begins the urban legend of 'the dirt ditching bandit'
ah yes most sectrestest tunnel only 1.55 millon people know about it
It's 2028. Colin's shed is nothing but hydraulic pumps now.
I dug post holes all day and this was a fair representation but only wished i had the 4 times speed option.
Bet he never uses the tunnel once completed. Or turns it into a bowling alley. One or the other
He really just #minecraft 'ed his video lmfao
Класное видео, ты очень крут, невероятная проделана работа, невероятное терпение, упорство, настоичивость. я восхищён. А, как много проделано работы с вспомогательными устроиствами которы оттягивают на себя кучу времени и средств. Браво.
in philippines that deep... it's already water
Kranke Aktion 🤪 es macht echt Spaß dir zuzusehen. Weiter so
По-моему медленно идут раскопки. В прошлом году по суглинку рыл выгребные ямы. За 4 часа выкапывалось порядка 4,5 кубических метров грунта лопатой и мускульной силой.
I want to dig as well! But I dont think the landlord of my appartment will like it. xD
Someone give this man a TV he's a genius mad but a genius
You could have used a garden auger and a drill
well, it is not a secret anymore.
Great video! I was about to suggest some sort of powered digging tool, then Colin puts together this hydraulic thing. What's next, a powered dirt auger?
Most underrated YouTuber out there.
I love that you are a madman doing all this in your back garden in the city, and not like farm land or something, but also that you are considerate of the neighbors and sound.
this house is going to be worth £££££ when he eventually sells it!! Imagine the estate agent's face when he has to photograph all the 'rooms'
Ok I wasn’t subscribed but once you did that bit with the Great Escape movie I had too lol
I'm so lazy I can't even build that in Minecraft
Imagine trying to get the permits to do that...
https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMduALpRR/
Never dig strait down🤣🤣
The neighbours arn't already used to all the loud and weird noises coming out of the shed thats they'd notice a bit of digging ??? ;P
Your naughty hiding the dirt
I always wanted to do something like this too! I was not allowed to do this when I was a kid.. now we dont have a garden anymore sadly ;D just dig down straight..
later ...so i turned into my neighbour's secret tunnel!
Some sort of pointed orgar would be good at digging
This man is insane, and I love it!
He's gonna sell the house and continue to live in the bunker with access to their food and stuff
Hola soy de Mexico. Necesito construir un túnel debajo de un edificio gubernamental. Pagar sería generoso. Hospédese en un hotel de estrellas.
I just got to 5:00 into the video and at that pace your gonna be done in a very very long time lmao
How is it a "Secret" when we all are watching you build it
Does he know something we don’t know?
literally digging an El Chapo tunnel
my dream is to have a colinfurze house and workshop fck a lambo this man is pure gold.
The video title~ ...SECRET TUNNEL!  SECRET TUNNELLLLL!  Through The Mountain, SECRET SECRET SECRET TUNNEL!
me and the boys in the sandpit
You had a whole year to dig with a spoon... Lazy I say. 🤣
Those indian guys watching this: look what they are trying to do to mimic a fraction of our power
The Mexican cartel is definitely taking notes 😂
Those indian guys watching this: look what they are trying to do to mimic a fraction of our power
Secret tunnel half the Internet knows🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
God help us. Our “capitol” is at risk! Is it an alien invasion!?
There’s me thinking he did this in like a week 😂😂😂
Every atla fan: "SECRET TUNNEL SECRET TUNNEL ...... AND DIEEE
Best YouTube tutorial for digging a tunnel into a bank. Excited for the silent digging part!
Your the freaking the best at making your adds watchable!
He might want to hire an archeologist, those rock formations look a lot like deteriorated brick.  Also it's kinda cool he went all El Chapo on us.
I want to buy your house when you sell it 🤣
The wind underground was a curious fenom ina,? phinom ena.? thing.! I hope you don't crack into your neighbours hydro scheme down there? Might  have some stinky sativa in a "basement" that keeps expanding with demand for his product, yuh kno????
2:15 "Strange piles of earth appearing in Stamford"
Must cost him a fortune to build all this stuff.
I understand why you pick unsigned bands for your background music but there's a good reason why they are unsigned. It absolutely bollox. Id never shit on a struggling band but I would pay for the privilege to not have to endure this aural onslaught of mediocrity. Love you and your channel. X
Dude you dug all of that💀 absolute machine
Make par three as fast as you can please we are all just as excited as you are
Automate Comment to Specific Accounts for Instagram and other features. This app only costs $3.
You really pulled off the stealth aspect. No one will ever know you have a secret tunnel.
I really like the #minecraft tag.
I love this dudes dedication and commitment to his projects. I subbed a few years back now (wow time files) because for one, he makes some weird things that i never even thought of wanting until I started to watch his videos. I love everything he makes. The music he puts on isn't that bad either (idk what genre of music to call it) as It opens me to more possible songs/artists. My 2nd reason is he is one of those channels where I know I can get away from all the BS and watch a guy creating things. Thank you for all the laughs and entertainment, and can't wait to see the final thing of this project.
Reminded me of when Fred Dibnah dug a pit in his garden - full brickwork and everything. https://youtu.be/tqAbMbRQ3jE
I wanna meet this man I love this man
*Hey, to you reading* .. you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
I love the idea of buying cereal and getting rocks instead
Imagen Colin ever selling his house…
when you played too much in Minecraft
It just shows how hard it was for the prisoner escape ww2 .. One camp dug three tunnels…
Wow bro. Just wow
I think its safe to say that his house is now worth more than james franco
Pablo Escobar has entered the chat
Why would you not work on it during the lockdown, what else did you do just sit in your house?
Funny
Alternant title "How to smuggle drugs"
You are a crazy man 😂
One person can't dig such a huge tunnel, even 2 for that matter, looks like he has finally met a project he can't complete.....
1:50 so that’s why I found a coco pops box full of soil at the shop a while back
when u think the FBI is coming to kill u but  you don't want anyone to think ur weird
You need to set up that stair treadmill as a dirt convayor belt to a lot bigger container  outside the shed.
Dig a tunnel dig dig a tunnel dig a tunnel dig dig a tunnel dig a tunnel dig dig a tunnel quick before the hyenas come
Minecraft Moment
I’m surprised Colin didn’t make a dirt conveyor belt lol
You need a small conveyor belt instead of buckets.
This guy is more productive than people on coke 💀💀
#minecraft
Wait... do you need/have any permit for that? 😅
if he ever moves again people are gonna find a lot of hidden underground stuff. would be hilarious
Ayyooo thats exciting! Can't wait to see the next part! 😆
You must live on the outskirts of town. Because where I live you'd be worried of hitting plumbing, electrical, septic or an archaeological site! Any one of them would get Council involved before you can say "over regulated"!
when i look up Spade vs Shovel with google, i get pictures and descriptions. Some pictures show me a spade being a rounded blade with a tip, and a shovel being a square blade, relatively flat. While others show me a spade being a square blade, relatively flat. And the shovel is a rounded blade with a tip.  So what is it? I am confused by all those people who have shared their opinion on the internet, providing pictures with a description on it, and them all being different from eachother.
Don't have to use a big jackhammer.  A rotary hammer works pretty decent.  Not nearly as loud.  Probably safer too.  Could even set up noise cancellation.  If you are in limestone, you could go really wild and use Hydrochloric acid to eat the rock.  Use the rotary hammer to drill say 50 holes and then just pour 55 gallons of acid in there and see where it is in a day...a week...whatever.  Maybe stir a bit, test the acidity...  Eventually, all the acid will be neutralized.  It would just make CO2, so it would be a little like you have an elephant respirating in there...nothing too extreme.
i wouldn't be surprised if Colin built a TBM.
The mesh makes me feel like I’m in the Batman elevator
Thank you for living the life all men wants, and thanks for sharing this with us!!! Greetings from HUN. :)
Saddam Hussein💣☪️ is typing....
might need a small mine cart and rail system soon
Secret tunnel, secret tunnel. Through the backyard SECRET TUNNEL, SECRET TUNNEL SECRET SECRET SECRET TUNNEL
So colin furze is a full on miner?
1.5 million people know about the Secret Tunnel.  So in what sense will it be secret?
I need secret tunnel.
Me: how did Colin manage to keep his hairstyle intact whilst digging for an entire day Colin: **shows the ad** Me: oh
I want to be Colin’s neighbor.
Wait wait wait. Did this video not hit #11 on trending?
Is he posting old videos or something because it's July now😅
How did this take to do
Congratulations. You have your own dungeon. And it’s big enough for at least three politicians and a tax inspector. There’s not even a key to throw away.
We lifted it all out on a pulley off the roof. We have a farm to dump the hundreds of tons of rock and stuff out onto what the bloody hell do you do in town bro?
Hey thats mining straight down
Colin if your council or department of housing or whatever it's called found out would there be problems. In Australia you would need engineering approval and everything!!!
waiting for part 3
DONT TRUST THOSE HANDLES!!!!
Don't you need to have a miner's license to dig anything that is not garden related?
The unbelievable amount of work he put into this is amazing
I hate it when videos end too soon 😭
-  👍 👍 🔧  -
Lets go!!!
Should have hired “El Chapós” ppl to help build it 🤣…relax it’s only a joke! Dont take it seriously
Tot show af
I was thinking that he was going to use an auger and make it hydraulic, nice and stealth
Whoever eventually buys your home one day in the future is certainly going to have a few unique features. Brilliant
Ok but when el chapo does it wrong 🙄
I like how the bunker is secret except to the 1.4 Million people that watched this video.
Who else is confused as to why Colin added #minecraft  (yeah I get it lol)
https://youtu.be/X8NO23iGcw8
1:44  Jaja sí Es él  El “cocu”
Only a couple of minutes in but would love to buy you a wheelbarrow just to save you back. Love the video keep making us smile. - from a friend In Alaska
You realize how long ago most of this was filmed, when he adds the hydraulic pump into the workbench. That was in a video years ago!
I'm watching this, and as cool as it is (and it is really, REALLY cool), I'm genuinely concerned about that trapdoor. If that comes down on someone's head, they're going to get concussion at the least, and possibly worse. Colin, PLEASE set up something so the door doesn't close too quickly
Colin, how many ties do you own?
Bro you're in fucken Lock Down aren't you - I'd love to drop the photos I have of doing the same thing!! but way before Lockdown. What you want is a complete copy of everything you have on the surface under ground. Directly under ground which is why they can't find it.
Estaría bien que pusieras subtítulos en español, en México te miramos muchos haces un exelente trabajo amigo.
Fuck the tunnel just keep digging till you get to China!
This is memeable, everyone start leaving dirt funny places
I would have moved the garage over the bunker
This is by far the craziest thing you've ever done. Even more than your firework specials, 360 swing, or that ATAT.
So the sponsor is paying u for digging a tunnel at your place….
Секретный? Я уже про него знаю )
Amazing creativity, although what's more amazing to me, is how you can do such heavy work wearing a tie and you don’t even appear to be sweating  : )
will you be framing it out with full metal sheets in a similar style to the bunker?
👍🤝
I'm still shocked that this is legal.
You are fucking insane, I know this is now your Job full time but Christ the patience and mental strength to do this is just mental!!!! Well done in need !!!
should've used a haste 2 beacon
Its like those simple tool video XD
if you want to keep it secret once it's done, how are going to roll the carpet over after closing the hatch when you go down?
In America we use a thing called a wheelbarrow.
4:57 I thought I was the only one who vacuumed my hair.
Woah he took Jeanie's outro from mxr plays quite literally
colin in regular white shirt: crazy'o'engineer colin in black shirt: t o m c r u z
Who else is born in 2006 hit like. 🙂
Do you not need a permit to do such a thing.
Mayo on escalater
ive been going back and watching older colin videos and i cant believe i didnt notice the roll up carpet or the mud stains LOL! its so obvious with hindsight
Fun video! can you copyright any of these designs.
Colin!!!! Where was the draft coming from!!?!?!?
А почему у него везде сухо? Где грунтовые воды?
Seems outrageously unsafe yet incredibly badass...wouldn't expect anything less
Mabey you should have built a tunnel digging robot befor you started this🤣😂
Did we all just watch a guy dig a hole?🤣🤣
Probably a good way to get in shape.
The fact that the trombone is reversed…
The gentleman scientist .
please be extra careful with proper air circulation so there’s not a furze shaped corpse under your yard
Literally Minecraft.
1:26 The Great Scape, such a great movie
do they not have wheel barrows in the UK?  lol....
Is there a reason you aren’t reinforcing it with concrete as you go??  If I was to do it, I’d put reinforced concrete in for every metre I dug, then move on to the lower section. That way when you complete a metre section it’s completely done.
I feel like those screen mesh sheets arent enough to hold back all that dirt in the event of a collapse. You should at least weld in some X shapes with rebar across them to help strengthen the center of those sheets a little better.
Live’n the dream! 🤘🏻
Honestly, as someone interested in different types/layers of earth and such, watching you dig and hit different layers under your shed makes me wonder if you will find any fossils? Or cool rocks of any sort? (Yeah, I'm a bit of a rock/fossil hound!) EDIT: Everyone else during lock-down finishes Netflix, Colin digs a secret tunnel LOL! I love this channel! 😃🤩🤩🤩🤩
Never dig straight down!
I wanted to do this when I was ten. Then I grew up. I regret growing up. I wanna be a ten year old again!😭
This is beautiful. I am pretty sure this is bravery in art.
"put the lotion in the basket"... I sense trouble lol
Over a million views in under 12 hours watching a man turn into a meerkat. Amazing
He going nuts over a small shovel
After all the crazy shit Furze has done over the years with thousands of fireworks, 360 swings, 80mph mobility scooters, etc, it would be very anticlimactic if what eventually kills him is just a pile of soil and dead worms.
You need to get ahold of those guys that build the swimming pools  with sticks to come help
https://youtu.be/N-tGMgwozY8
Use a really big drill the kind they use for putting in power poles
Entertainment in 2021:  Man digs hole. Millions tune in to watch.
Now not are secrets because 1.4m peoples are ready know.
I feel like his house is going to end up like the one from hello neighbor
Colin! You sneaky Bastard! So now we know the real reason that Hydraulic power pack was installed years back!  Anyway's I'm hoping your leaving enough Room in that tunnel to be able to install something like a Service duct in there so you can run all your Extra Power / Data Cables, Air / Water lines, Hydraulics and what ever else you might need to run, while being able to cover them and still have a tunnel of usable size.  With a Tunnel that's planned to go from House to Bunker, it's also the perfect way to run any extra services you might need that weren't run originally.  Have you also considered installing a Battery Backup power system, and Maybe add some solar as well for some independence during grid outages? If you need any ideas, Check out Engineer557, as he does a lot of Bunker power stuff among things: https://www.youtube.com/user/engineer775
Ебанутые землекопы во всем мире похожи друг на друга. Сильно напоминает мне нашего Александра (ака Самоделкин).
I am pretty sure this is how a proper meth lab is built.
YEAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
So a secret door that you can't open from underneath because a carpet and rolling toolbox is on it, and that if you open from the top, you can't cover up and will be obvious to everyone who walks in?
Seeing him using a pickaxe on dirt *wait, that's illegal*
Have you considered Nitropril ? Its fun makes a bit of a bang and its fairly dangerous! Perfect. Or maybe a water jet with a pump to pump all the muck out just like a dentist does.
"I'd like to build a potato launcher" Europe: WTF DEADLY WEAPON!! CRIMINAL!! TERRORIST ALERT!!!!! "I'd also like to tunnel through the suburbs to my nuclear bunker" Europe: cool  wtf is Europe
this is so crazy, the idea of "not disturbing your neighbors" here in Brazil people just do any noise they want any time until 10 pm
Like I said last time, if you want to get rid of all the dirt you excavate then simply dig another tunnel and dump it in there.
Find yourself someone that looks at you the way Colin's vacuum cleaner looks at him!
Can someone please edit together a compilation of Colin Furze digging, except all the footage is slowed down and played to the peaceful Minecraft music we all know and love?? 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
13:20 By now wouldn't the neighbors be used to all sorts of noise coming from the shed even from LONG before Covid?
I dont even wear a tie to work.
maybe a big vaccum truck, ie street sweeper..
Why doesn't he have a demo hammer with a spade bit? That could've saved him ages on the dig.
This guy can survive a nuclear war
@colinfurze after seeing your head in the cookie bin, you cut to sitting on the can and I thought ... "o gawd nooo ... not furze's head in the loo!"
I had goosebumps!
Lol, sounds like someone has gotten noise complaints.
Lockdown? Let's dig down!
I see a. Jet powerd vacuum cleaner coming up soon
Man, if you ever decide to sell this house the next owners going to be fucking weirded out and think you were a doomsday prepper something lmao
if you dig that whole tunnel by hand I will grovel at your feel if I ever meet you.
Best way of hiding a sneaky covert tunnel dig is to post it on an internationally famed youtube channel, naturally.
well it's not a secret anymore
Please hurry I can't stand the wait
You need way better reinforcement of those walls. What you currently have isn't going to stop a cave in. You need heavy reinforced I-beams and a dynamic-Bolt reinforcement of the wire mesh. Actually the wire mesh your using doesn't have enough flex if part of the wall gives way . Chain link fence would be a better alternative.
Have you ever seen a trench collapse. You need to shore up the sides as you go. You are lucky you were buried alive.
man it seems like it just isn't financially worth it to sell your house with all your upgrades. and how would you even show all this to potential new home owners haha
How are you going to get through the concrete that is around your bunker
8:08 song?
I thought UK was the land of "you need a permit to {insert your common task here}". Didn't know it was permitted there to build smuggler style tunnels.
All of that and no auger? So weird that you wouldnt use one?
"I am a dwarf and im digging a hole!"
4:53 "Your capitol is at risk." Oh no, Washington DC is under attack by the British again :D Secret agent Colin let us in on it.
how about building a conveyor belt with scoops to move the dirt out.
U should build on if those playground excavators for the tunnel project
Imagine just slamming a water main and  drowning in the hole
Should have built a conveyor belt
COLIN....im upset this video wasnt longer!!! So excited to see the finished project!!! Your fabrication inspired me to learn how to weld!
this man knows something that we don't.
13:36 I see someone is an Dr. Stone fan
Im still really intrigued by the crack with a draft
Now that's how ads should be done. You don't even want to skip
A good thing I guess like 3 months
Epic!
I ought to be working in the coal mine cuz Lord knows I love digging holes. Brent Cobb Diggin holes it's a really good song.
Nutcase....as a compliment though
You have to see the narco tunnels in Mexico.
Dude its been far too long that I've had to tell someone on YouTube your nuts. And I've seen a lot of shot lol
If you still have all the soil/clay left, you could try refining it into clay and make your own pottery and glaze ware. ;P
Love was a man who was nailed through his hands and feet into a cross before that he was whipped and wore a crown of thorns, he committed no crime or sin,but his blood was paid to use for our sins, his name is  Jesus Christ! Do you know him? † He loves you so very much! 🖤☁️
Too late but soil is a medium for builders, in a sack they make sandbag walls; in that same sack with quicklime makes cement-bag walls; if you herringbone stack tyres and fill them with soil they manage to construct a robust shock absorbing wall: feel free to vault off these notions at any time.
What if your neighbors watch this video....oh no....oh no....oh no no no no no
Why aren't you using a water jet to bore the hole?

I’m addicted to this series
If only there were some type of chainsaw that digs... Just clean cut blocks out of the tunnel wall
Let's get it to #1
imagine how much fun a game of hide and seek would be without anyone knowing about the bunker or trap doors or anything just finding out the secrets of the house as you go along
this is the beginning of the city of ember
Not very secret is it
I'm so happy to see a reference to the great escape 😂
Dig
Do you not have an auger?😂
You should asked to El Chapo, I heard he is quite good on the digging tunnels area
Colin trying to hide from the local council so he doesn't get turned into planning for digging a tunnel under his house...
I was hoping the wind you were feeling was gonna turn out to be a huge cave system already there
Colin is like a ficticious human being, doing things that people do in stories that are not real. Except he is a real person actually digging a secret underground tunnel, connecting his house, his shack, and his mother fucking underground bunker.
You don’t want ur neighbours to know but ur famous as fuck on here 🤔
"Secret" but like posts a YouTube video telling everyone about it
🔫 make a time machine so i can watch the rest of these videos
Secret tunneellllll, secret tunnelllllllll, secret tunnEEElllllll, secret tunnellll!!!
Ventilation, what if you fart down there by accident ???
Hey dummy it's not a secret if you tell everyone.
Yo you gotta dig out that crack and show us whats in there
hey colin im not sure if ur gonna see this but this is day 3 of asking why you dont do a collab with alec steele it would be awsome
use a hand turned ice auger....or even drill powered....hell just use a motor powered one for going down in dept..   do the four corners and one or two in the middle, and it would only take like 20 minutes or so... then it will make it 10x easier to remove the dirt on the way down at least,  then use a drill powered one for going horizontal. trust me! and save your back and time!
Freakin awesome mate, I wonder if I did that here in Straya if I’d find any gold being a gold rich district, might be worth thinking about 🤪👍
Crazy!
hi
In America, since 06/01, they know their capitol is at risk. As for the CAPITAL people may invest... Well it depends, innit?
Watching this, it looks like hes digging a 2 by 2 hole in minecraft
Obviously the same thing happened to the last time it was in the right place and it was just curious to see all those things come true regardless of what time it went down to one side bigger than the previous order but the end is probably the same thing on 500inches past the timber opening of my favorite place on this issue and the other thing about it again was that already contacted me and I was going through a few times on a date yet again man I wish I could have been able to see all those other things that become more important to the people of the most involved with my own business in the next couple of quarters and then the future will be treated like the best option for our customers in the next two sugars and get some good results from our questions and the rodents not sure what to expect that from this crap or something else to make them realize they were likely created to make the game better for the next one of my favorite things worse than the previous one of them is a violation of my own opinion on this issue but not smart enough for the best option.
1:35 It's not what you think ladies.
omg
COLLIN MAKING A SECRET TUNNLE BY NOT LETTING IT BE A SECRET BY POSTING IT ON YOUTUBE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ye
Wouldn't a post hole digger be more effective for digging?
Good idea
2:27 Get 2 sticks, 1 iron, craft a shovel.
If I am a furze neighbor and I don't hear constant noise from the shed I might start to get a little worried.
The castle well in Nürnberg gets substantially wider about 5 meters down. Colin's issues with swinging his tools are probably the reason why...
insane video! cant wait to see more.
fuck we need a colinfurze michael reeves and i did a thing collab
Cooooollll
You know if he decides to move to another house I want to read the description of the listing for this one.
This man is a inspiration
Oh my dear lord it's actually happening. This is going to be the craziest single yard in the whole UK
"Where's that draught coming from?".....I was almost expecting the next scene to be a hole filled with sewerage and Collin covered in shit haha
be interesting to know what kind of permits and such he had to get to do this in the UK, and how that compares to other places in the world
im curious how safe this is? like he looks like he built proper retaining walls to prevent a wall collapse but how about proper airflow and other unknown hazards.
The man who once used a pulse jet to clear snow from his driveway is worried about disturbing the neighbors...
Why do you have to hide it from the neighbours?  Especially with a youtube channel with 11 million subs you dont think theyll find out?  And, what are you actually doing to get rid of the dirt?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dA4DiBbJdUs          sorry couldn't help myself Colin..
By his sudden need for quiet, anybody else get the feeling that Colin has maybe got a neighbor complaint or two? Possibly with police involvement?
not sure how secret it is anymore with 1.7M views
It’s weird to see Colin concerned about noise. Lol
live action version of peter (family guy)getting grounded
i dont get it? in australia you can make as much noise as you want during the day then at night no noise? surely the same in england?
Why didn't you just make a hydraulic post hole digger auger
Two lovers, forbidden from one another A war divides their people And a mountain divides them apart Built a path to be together  ...Yeah, and I forget the next couple of lines, but then it goes...  Secret tunnel! Secret tunnel! Through the mountain! Secret, secret, secret, secret tunnel! Yeah!
Exciting title: DIGGING A SECRET TUNNEL American title: DIGGING A BASEMENT
band practice??? pssh, that is jamming! you don't gotta practice noffin mate!
I hope you called 8-1-1 before you dug
7:17. This footage is from two years ago which means this project (atleast that hydraulic tool for digging the hole, and hence, digging the hole) was done atleast two years ago.   Please explain this   Edit: I’m a dumbass nvm
You know it's not a secret if everybody on the internet knows about it
clicked the link, but live in murica....  damnit, i want this app....
how about you wash it and filter you may get gold you never know 1:26
Hey Colin! Thanks for using our track again! :) You rock! \m/(*^*)\m/
Zombie apocalypse breaks out:  Colin: hold my jackhammer
This thing would be awesome to own! Original house value: 200k - bathrooms - bedrooms - etc Transformed house value: N/A - bunker - Secret tunnel  - etc
If it weren't for the whole secret-y bit, a tunnel seems like it would have been a perfect Furze pandemic\lockdown project.
🧥
you would be swimming by now at my house
FBI OPEN UP
Just a thought you could build a high powered vacuum and you break it up it can suck it out. Might be easier just a thought
Colin saying that only the digging down took him a year. I'm wondering how long it will take to see a part 3 🤨
I'm sure someone has mentioned this already, but you might want to get a radon gas monitor
Finds crack with a draft, follows it into the neighbors secret tunnel
Did anyone else ever dig a really deep hole when you were a kid?
It's clay, not rock.. sheesh.
Low rpm electric auger would be 10x faster with more control
Put them tubs on wheels. Get an E tool, you can also get a spade attachment for an electric chipper
Peace ☮️
I still need my boom box jacket lol 😂
This guy is basically making a Minecraft house IRL with all the additions he keeps making lol
No lava, no bedrock? I'd guess Y=12
That’s why there was dirt in my cearal
I’ve literally grown up watching this guy. Thanks for all these years of amazing content.
REspect with digging the shaft.  Should have got a few Sappers to five you a hand.
Jesus no wonder this guy has 11 million subs lol
NSA and FBI are looking at you.
Colin, was it difficult to get council approval to do this? What loops did you have to jump through?
This has always been a dream of mine. so cool to see someone doing it.    great video, loved the side bits.
Tought This Is One Of Those 11 Years Ago Vids
Today I learned the term "skew-whiff".
make 3 video in 1 week
In this episode, Furzey commits multiple crimes: Dumping, tampering with food, and leaving a bag in a public area.
"1000 of hours top create nothing" - the story of a hole
can't wait to see the finished results
Thank you so much for your work! You're doing so many things I've wanted to do, but haven't made happen. I can't wait for the next video!!
Not so secret when you are trending on youtube!
You the man!
It's not a secret tunnel if you post it on YouTube Colin
Gahd dangit Dale.
I mean there's highly furze-friendly ways of soundproofing the shed... though you'd be approaching 'basically building a small house' levels of investment lol
I loved "The Great Escape" reference
Dang it would take about 7700 permits to even make a drawing of doing this in the states
One of the few brits I respect
https://youtu.be/nOBJvQrstt4
The citizens of East Berlin approve.
alternate title: MAKING AN UNDERGROUND METH LAB WITHOUT MY NEIGHBORS NOTICING"
Tom, Dick, and Harry, If anyone knows them by heart, you are a true legend
Batcave vibes ngl
Forgot for a moment how long ago this project started. Saw Colin mounting the hydraulic press under the bench and I"m like wait he did that already. inception
Should’ve built a dirt conveyor belt first haha
THIS IS KINDA SIMILAR TO THE BEACH HOUSE YOU MADE COLIN...
Would love to see the realtors reaction to his house lol
What's the music name at 12:16? Super epic
My man put more effort for us to have intrest with the sponsor than ads on TV that really meant to advertise such a thing.
Air ratchet with auger end would of been easier than the ram
You should make a little car lift
I love The Great Escape reference!
you're nailing it, even the ads are flipping awesome
A proper gentleman always wears a tie when digging a tunnel. Fun video, thank you! Mike
The patience and dedication to the bit to NOT work through 15 months of "This would fill in boredom" time.
For the trapdoor i would fill it with a sound deafening material because, well, concrete dont make a metal sound
Sinaloa cartel enters the chat
Next Episode of DIGGING A SECRET TUNNEL.   Finding the magic
I’m sorry but why not just sound proof the walls lmao
So that's what the hydraulic powered shed was really for, very good.
I am very slightly disappointed that Colin didn't build a conveyor belt to carry away the dirt prior to the dig... maybe a "working persons' TBM" is coming up =D
Colin is easily gonna survive the apocalypse
Colin, as the master builder that you are, I’m surprised you didn’t build a system to conveyor the dirt out of your shed to a disposal site.. 🤨
Colin! WRONG HYDRAULIC CHOICE!! Use a pressure washer with a shop vac, just the equipment noise to muffle but you can surgically cut & remove ??
That looks like heavy clay soil. I don't envy you at all. On the other hand, it does stick together well and allows you to dig without the sides constantly crumbling in on you.
Don't you have to bleed all the hydraulics after you connect the hoses and equipment? Get the air out?
Colin is playing DiRTy tricks
I'm waiting for you to find a surprise from WW2 ? 🧞
I'm so excited to see this finished
It would probably be less suspicious of he just dug the hole with out the cover.
Legit awesome
Yeeesss
DISCOVERING A BALROG Part 3
you're bloody loose mate lol never a dull moment eith mr furze
Why is he digging all of this? Don't they have Mexicans in the UK?
This is awesome and absolutely mental.  Thanks for the play CF.
I half expected the crack to be a sewer trunk line !
Couldn't you just go into creative and make a tunnel in a minute?
Should have had Milwaukee sponsee this with some new electric jack hammers.
I wonder what the future owners will think when they find this stuff
I’m so glad this secret is only shared with 1.3 million people so far. I mean there’s no way anyone would share this with everyone they know.   Coincidentally the German government has some questions for you about a breakout. Hurry up and build so you can hide.
2:56 no fake hand? where is the real Colin?
El Chapo would be proud....
add vent pls or no oxigen
1:14 I'm surprised you didn't fabricate a rolling giant sheet metal box to dump it all in, instead of having to aim lol
Epic.
I’ve always wanted to dig a cave deep underground and this is satisfying that desire brilliantly
You should have done this as a collaboration with Time Team.
You should have a huge vacuum with a holding tank you could dump much like we have in America for potholing, we use them for spotting electrical lines, phone lines, gas lines and so on.
You must be making bank for the UK or wherever to hand you permits to do this type of stuff.
It not exactly a secret now is it?
I firmly believe that by 2030 Colin will have built an entire subterranean civilisation
Not so secret now is it...?
Deep hole lol
Imagine seeing the floor plan of the house if ever he decided to sell it 🤣🤣
There is an old rule, that usually holds true, where you basically need to skip to 30% into a youtube video before you get to the real content. With this video, I had to go to about 50%.
I would use a power auger to loosen the dirt
I bet he regrets thinking this idea up now lol digging SUCKS! I have to do it a lot at work and it's horrible. I don't enjoy it
I just can’t imagine the low back pain
If you go sideways and it goes outside underground I wonder if it will get wet in there when it rains
How utterly ridiculous
Colin discovered the secret to a happy married during Covid lockdown...
This is by far your best project.
I'm doing Archaeological Field School right now which is basically an apprenticeship in digging square hole. All I think about is how Colin's hole has crooked walls.
This is sort of crazy I can get behind
Building Permit?
Is the whole not wanting to disturb neighbours really a thing of courtesy, or is it just to ensure the tunnel really is "secret" (apart from being on the internet and available to everyone.)
I was hoping to see you build a tunnel boring machine for this!
It never dawned on me that if I wanted, I could just dig a basement for my garden shed and double it’s capacity … thank you Colin!
A plumber yes!
Why didn't he use conveyors to carry the dirt instead of buckets
“Secret Tunnel”  The 1.3 million people watching this    👁👄👁
Colin's way too excited about digging a hole.
BREAKING NEWS: Man digs hole.
imagine colin going to his HOA meeting each month and having to explain why he’s been filling his bins with 250+ kg of dirt
Is carbon monoxide/other heavier than air gasses a risk?  I see no ventilation  nor monitoring.
No joke I'm super excited for you. You're living my dream right now
BRO...... You are absolutely MAD, I mean you are a right NUT BALL. And I am totally on board with you. This is an AWESOME thing to do. And all by HAND ????? WHAAAAAAAAAT ? YOU'RE A LOON AND I LOVE IT. Keep me posted 🤘🤘
You’ve got the best camera angles! A tunnel like this is seriously one of my biggest dreams!!
Did you call Miss-Dig?  how do you know you're not busting through public utilities?
*breathes in* SECRET TUNNEL! SECRET TUNNEL!
surprised he didn't build a simple conveyor system to carry the load out to where it can be shoveled into a truck
But Colin! How do you escape back out the secret entrance or cover up the secret lid after going in?
Meanwhile if I tried this I'd be removed from my house by the HOA
You got the brain, the resources, the money, and the skill. At this point sir, I won't be surprised if you become a vigilante fighting crimes wearing some badass costume.
Use a Auger drill
Colin, you can't keep calling it a secret as you tell the world about it. Secrets out. 😂
5:14 Wayne’s world be like
Smart of you to get everyone into stocks and get sponsored doing it
All I hear is "SECRET TUNNELLLL"
**Takes two episodes to get partway through digging a tunnel**  2 Indian men that make underground houses in a single video: "pathetic"
It puts the lotion on it's skin...
Why the quietness? Are you still having flashbacks to the time you used a pulse jet to clear the snow off your driveway and someone complained at you? (You really should put that one on YouTube. It's almost impossible to find!)
You should find a way to soundproof it
you will need to light a few torches to keep the creepers and skelly's at bay. Better take a sword.
I remember that install of a hydraulic system; are we reusing old clips?
Where did that crack lead to? Where is the air coming from?
I love you channel its my childhood
Wow being american pays I get 275 or 413 or 688 dollars for only $2.75
you should invented micro excavator before digging tunnels
Man I can't believe  that Covid brought y'all  down to a halt completely  for over a year. Come to Texas brother, we closed down for about 2 weeks hard and then we've  been open ever since. You can wear a mask  if you like, but it is not required at all
To be fair you’re always providing next level content
A British guy makes a Mexican Drug Tunnel in his backyard.
so where was the air / wind coming from?
You need an Auger on that pump..
Clever He definitely doesn’t want the neighbors knowing about his tunnel
Just remember, old miners did better than current miners. Side brace and overhead bracing, is a thing
So I'm having a time line issue in my head. When you made your video installing hydraulics in your shed, was that video made the same time that you installed it in the footage here?  Leave it to Colin to make an amazing mind bendingly cool video, and then actually mess your mind by breaking your sense of time!  Kudos!
Been watching to many videos about panning for gold, felt like moving all that dirt without trying was a waste.
are you toni kroos
Geez your a crazy bastard. I love ya... lol  Keep up the great content mate...
what. you were already like 3 or 4 meters underground, couldn't you just throw in a lamp and close the lid? I seriously doubt the neighbors would hear anything - or anyone outside the shed for that matter
In 10 years time Colin is ganna have a fully functional fallout shelter that fits everyone in his neighborhood and has an intricate tunnel system between all their homes with all of his inventions at their disposal to arm themselves when it comes time to resettle the surface after the future apocalypse.
What a beautiful use of the Great Escape. Bravo!
Someone should buy this guy a wheelbarrow.
Wow you got some goedspa hehe epic mr.
I can't believe that a posthole auger wasn't used. Could have dug the whole thing in a few days using an auger.
How's your lower back doin though
KEEP US UPDATED ON THE CRACK PLEASE I GOTTA KNOW WHERE IT GOES
Am I the only one worried about ventilation and air in these tunnels
Epic
WHERES YOUR JET ENGINE?!?!?!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT0EmAgP-_k you must see this video from primitive unique tool how to dig
I bet the planning permission part of the council must hate getting an application from Furze. Like, 'oh what fucking now?'
Why not use an auger? Even a hand one to break up the hard dirt and then use a shovel to clear the rubble.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyfxB_SqWtc
Odds this guy dies berried alive under his garden.
im worried about that crack in limestone, there might be a cave under your house and might cause a sink hole
coolest dad ever!!!
This has got to be the best quarantine project - lol
Colin puts the lotion on his skin.  Or he gets the hose again.
SECRET TUNNELLLLLLLLLL! SECRET TUNNELLLLLLLL! THROUGH THE MOUNTAAAAAINS! SECRET, SECRET, SECRET, SECRET, TUNNNNEEEELLLSSS!
This is the craziest shit I’ve ever seen. The only way I could be more entertained is if his wife had a channel documenting her thoughts… truly a man that deserves every view he gets.
Should have just rented a big ass dry vac, and sprayed all the dirt right outside.
Colin's gonna be lookin like arnie after all of this digging 🤣
Auger!
Just imagine how much his house is worth now after everything he's done
imagine attempting to sell this house
this guy is like Phineas and Ferb fused together.
Just a little deeper and you'll find Diamonds, Lava, and also Bedrock.
The word of the day is “Wheelbarrow!” 😄
When you absolutely have to dig a hole the hardest way possible. Colin Furze. Accept no substitutions.
How much cocaine does this dude do?
Do you not have 5 gallon buckets in England?
💪🏼💪🏼
Insane he didnt show any of this during what? 3 years? And the hydraulic-system he did during this and for this project. I just wonder if hes keeping something else hidden in the background during his videos, that we'll see in 3 years! Insane commitment colin.
El Chapo has entered the chat room
Do you know what I'm realizing from this video, just how long he's really been at this. He mentioned installing that hydraulic pump like a year ago at least. This leads me to believe that for at least that long there has been a secret trapdoor under the carpet and a growing tunnel system right under the shed carpet.
The person who buys this house after they move is gonna be stoked
I love the Great Escape reference 👍 awesome video
saddan russaim moment
I am jealous
0:28 I cant think of anything worse, that is hell.
Meanwhile the neighbours a subscriber. Wandered what all that noise was about. 🤣
There's no way any of his neighbors have not heard of his channel.
Wonder if the neighbors watch these videos
Next vid, Colin Launches a 6 foot diameter... TMB  How Bore-ing...
Ive wanted to do this in my back ever since i went on a mine tour ar 5 yrs old. You videos always build my confidence up...safty first though
Does your tunnel shaft sit above ground? You may need a raised threshold around the shaft entrance to make sure it cannot fill your tunnel with water.
I thought he was joking about doing it without noise....until the end!
i like the reference from that movie even while digging
I  JUST  NEED  MORE !!!!
Hire a dog to dig that hole
This is freak'n epic! I now have make my own :-)
Never dig straight down...
I can't wait to see the new TBM.
Make a small mini hydraulic excavator bucket, once your in a bit, build a mine cart system and then mount the little digger to the cart.
if there was a nobel prize for the "coolest human" im sure that colin`s would be nominated...
Colin: I want to talk to tom, so music won't work   *Proceeds to play an instrument you can't talk with while playing*
love to meet this guy in person. he is like such a cool guy
It often makes more sense to explain the noise away rather than attempt to suppress it.
Especially when you're talking about bringing motors down there, remember to be careful of carbon monoxide and dioxide!
Yes sr
Right Collin all you need now is a netherite pickaxe and get workin
raunchy
Can't believe he didn't build a mini excavator for this!
What are coco pops lol
A micro backhoe would be handy lol
Oi! You got a loicence for that!
I'm surprised that you haven't made your own tunnel boring machine yet!
that'd cave in just a couple of feet down here, it's all dry sand
Aww i thought lockdown would've been ideal for uninterrupted digging XDD but it does make sense it'd be bad for neighbors
was that the minecraft guy that helped digging ?
Keep on digging!
Minecraft makes this seem a lot easier...
Why did you make a hydraulic auger?
Dig a tunnel, dig dig a tunnel.
His neighbours probably watched this and wondered why he is trying to be stealthy
Josef Fritzl would be proud.
What's funny is he always wears thag suit and now he's digging and it still don't get dirty 😂
Jesus imagine how much your house is worth now man 😅
If he's being quiet, you know his neighbors are getting nervous. Like when the kids are quiet for too long.
I thought this was a new video, but there's no new content in here after September of 2019. I guess I'll sub for Sunday's update.
I'm kind of surprised that you didn't build something like an Archimedes screw for moving the dirt.
So Collin installed that hydraulic system *how long ago* so he could dig a secret tunnel?! And he even made a video all about it without spilling the beans! Careful; that man can keep a secret better than the Devil himself.
You could try controlled blasting on a day y'all do fireworks
Colin, I'm digging a secret tunnel. I have 11 Million subscribers so who will know. July 1, 2021 1,278,235 people have viewed this video. But it is still a secret tunnel. LOL
When you said dispose of the soil, that clip you played was exactly what I was thinking of.
Imagine doing this while listening to ''Mudvayne-Dig''
You're on the next level mate! fully sick!
I have a crazy thoughts about you dressing up as Batman then you can say you are going to your batcave.
I hope you left the soil in the supermarket.
They make a gas powered shovel!!!....
I always thought you were beastly smart....nope pure beast. So awesome. Most people would have quit with the pick ax. Thanks for working so hard to entertain us.😁
Colin are you going to use a mini excavator for digging the tunnel for the outside bit and you could use the excavator to make the people around your house think you are putting in a water feature
Only one of the greatest outtros the internet has ever seen....
By the way you are doing this project in silence it sounds like your neighbours are complaining about the noise you generate when building your projects. You need a nice big farmhouse with a spare barn with two acres of land around you.
muito massa esse projeto gosto muito dos teus vídeos  abraço do brasil pra vc o solo ai e bem diferente
This is real "boring", hehe
Did you have to get anyone to do any land scans before you did the runner to make sure no pipework or wires were passing under? Or did you just go for it and work around if it came to it ?
I must be getting old. My first thought was   "Christ, the planning permission must've been a nightmare..."
please tell me we won't have to wait a full year to see the next video lol
I'm a big fan of your doings and creation mr. Furz😁 watching here from d philippines🇵🇭
colinfurzes Minecraft mod !!
And I thought digging in Minecraft was hard
you need to call El chapo's crue
so awesome! cant wait to see it done!
The best way to keep something secret is to post it on the internet so that the whole world can access your activities.
R.i.p to Colins back
He's playing Minecraft the way I do: underground. This is the representation I've been looking for.
Like where da fuq came that idea "im gonna build a tunnel"
I love secret tunnels, and your bunker is one of the coolest things I've ever seen,, but why go through the pain of making it so your neighbors don't notice if you're just going to upload it to YouTube?
SECRET TUNNELLLLLLL SECRET TUNNELLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
Pretty funny video, but be a bit careful because toxic gasses might concentrate in such holes. So push some fresh air from outside into the hole when you are in it and don't work alone. It also might be some other gas coming out of that crack, who knows.
Use a air impact chisel
Colin man, you are insane haha. been watching since 2009 and nothings changed.
I am surprised he didn’t hit water
Dreams...
Oooh this is soooo exciting!!! Can't wait to watch the rest!!! I loved the bunker videos (as well as all the other vids) but oooh I can't wait! I'd love the chance to be able to do what he does! My whole family are colin furze mad! We love him and his amazing work!
These are the only people who dress up nicely to dig a whole
Stage up a neighbor who's come sniffing around, not because they've heard strange sounds coming from your place, but because it's been quiet.  Could have some real fun with that one.
He left all that dirt in the mall and a local pub 😂😂😂😂
His neighbors must love him🤣🤣🤣
I'd somehow cut the carpet to fit the trap door or change the flooring to have the trap door blend in because it's going to be an absolute pain in the behind to move everything & roll it up in order to use the tunnel every time.
I had already been whistling. 👍😅
Hey Colin!  We'd love for you to try and build the sword in the Raya and the last dragon movie.  Please consider it!
Cant wait for part 3!!
Seems like he could insulate his shed really well to muffle the noise and not bother the neighbors.
Who was that Chinese man you ran into down in that Chinnel?
Adopt me plzzzz
Ahh yes. Its all coming together. Now its fully efficient
Question, how do you build a tunnel in Florida where your basically at sea level?
Guess it's better than a gym membership, bet you lost more fat and gained more muscle your way.
“The neighbors” is actually “The family”  Your wife can’t say no if you’ve already done it!
Minecraft rule #1 and #2... Never dig straight down or straight up!
this what a month of lockdown do to a man.
Waiting for him to hit a Roman Villa or Bronze Age round house….
Was thinking Colin was going to make a bicycle  powered posthole digger,  corkscrew digger or something like that.
Applaud your guts, I wouldn't do it without proper shoring after the 5 foot depth.  A cave in is the worst possible thing.  Probably not the best idea honestly.
GOT ! it ! - a passel of gophers hopped up on espresso. (proud smirk)
Great Escape Colin and Deer Hunter Tom
with the tunnel, you could easily put a ground source heat pump into the walls or ceiling and you could heat or cool your house garage and bunker and even heat your water.
we need a part 3 asap
9:31  A United States Airforce colonel opens a hidden hatch and says "what's that noise? How did you get here??"  Colin made his way to NORAD
The permitting on this must be crazy.
I'm only here for the music
Collin noo don’t dig straight down you might fall in lava
AMAZING VIDEO, great work. Really outdone yourself this time !  Freetrade only available to people in UK?
I need to find out how this man has so much enthusiasm for digging a hole.
SECRET TUNNEL, SECRET TUNNEL, THROUGH THE MOUNTAINS
You should do a colab with El Chapo Guzman
You should make an emergency radio system to the outside in case of collapse
how do you explain this when you sell you're house?
Not really a secret if you broadcast it to millions of people.
Not sure what the building dept is like in the UK, but would be interested in knowing what it took to get authorization to do this?  A few pints and a plate of banners and mash?
the draft though! dig to the draft!
Remember, call 811 first...oh...wait...never mind...too late now!
UNCLEDOUG    SAYS   WHAT  THE  HELL  IS  WRONG  WITH  YOU   ????????????????   COME  TO     BOONE   NORTH  CAROLINA    USA   AND  WE  WILL   MESS  UP  THE  WORLD !!!!
All I've got underground is ancient lacustrine sediment.  It's both good and bad.  No jack hammer is needed, but the risk of collapse is huge.  The shaft would require continuous shoring.  And that requires money or resourcefulness beyond my ken. :/
My grandpa lives on his property 200 acres or something like that he bought it and it had old ww2 tunnels and stuff he bought it for that reason he thinks people are gonna try and kill him some day he did 3 tours in nam so I guess that kinda screwed him up anyway this video just reminded me of that
is it really that secret?

Have you thought about putting sound proofing up in your toolshed? It may not keep the sound completely out but might dampen it enough to work you could work a little more consistently And a little louder
who ever owns furzes house in the future will be in for a bunch of surprises
This is so good
Jeez, don’t you know not to dig strait down
Never expected to see Colin play Minecraft but I’m not upset
Ja ich bin das deutsche Kommentar auf das du gehofft hast 😂
This is the craziest thing I've ever seen on YouTube but it's the coolest also
The next Fred Dibnah of the next generation excellent work
I want to be there the day this house is sold to someone who has no idea who Colin is.
I love you!
You're a crazy talented dude.  Very impressive.
I NEED to know what that crack leads to
This video needs to be renamed as "Colin Furze: Lets play Minecraft"
permit?
me lockdown : watching colin youtube colin lockdown : busy digging
Instead of all those baskets for dirt, get a wheel barrow.
I love that you use all that energy for good. By good I mean fucking badass!
As a pipe layer, i spend a lot of time down in deep holes. I highly recommend more reinforcement, like thicker steel sheets rather than mesh…  Please dont die Colin. Cave-ins happen out of nowhere and are deadly.
So now we see why he did that beach sand pit... Bit of a dry run?
Colin is either gonna go the super villain rout or the Wallace and Gromit rote he’s got the inventions an underground base (bunker) and now the secret entrances
I hate how deep you dug without any kind of shoring in that hole. Especially with using impact power tools
This is both awesome and crazy
Mine craft IRL doesn't look like that much fun.
@Colin 🤔 How are you gonna go sideways, its gonna take forever without a mini diger ? And what's the foundation like under your house like you don't want half of your house falling in do ya.. im like confused 😕
I wonder how many permits and surveys he needed.
I can't believe he didn't make a conveyer belt to move the dirt away.
what i wouldn’t give to be able to live in his house
This is literately hogans hero's in real life
Love it !! Always wanted to dig a tunnel as soon as I watched great escape lol 😂
out of curiosity, whats the temperature at the bottom of you hole?
Jeez the cartel shouldve hired you by now
Nobody tell him that it isn't a secret anymore if he posts it to YT... lol
and waiting for the 11 million subscriber celebration video? :-)
You’ve got to like a guy that digs a tunnel in a button down shirt.
couldn't you use a hydro excavator for at least part of this?
On the next episode, Colin fabricates a mini TBM from a box of scraps.
5 minutes in.  So many Great Escape references... I wonder when the motorcycle sequence and tennis ball toss  begins.
(Archeologists in a 1,000 years stumbling on Colin’s workshop) “What in the hell….”
I keep straining my ears to hear a sound   Maybe someone is digging underground
THE FERRETS ARE ON TO YOU MATE
Imagine.. Being so thoughtful of the neighborhood you just build a new machine because you can...
Dude, love the Great Escape reference! Next time try it wearing more baggy trousers. Haha!
Now that I see this it reminds me a little of *the real life guy* with their tunnel to the underground house. My suggestion would be a kind of rail system where you sit on a board and then move forward either by muscle power (pedals on the bike) or by a small motor, which can be controlled in any direction with muscle power using a switch
Gem
This guy is rad.
why you don’t have the carage sound proof is amazing
Can't wait
At this pace Why don’t build the BATCAVE? 🦇
Aye a secret you post online, I can relate
Legendary
Man I cant wait till the next video! Looking awesome so far!!
After world war three ends and all of civilization is turned back to the bronze age, this man will become Steve  Real life minecraft
just a man digging a hole ey?
Clearly I've seen too much ATLA. If you have you know what's stuck in my head right now.
Seriously though mate, where did you take all the aggregate?  I’m guessing a project like this is displacing thousands of cubic yards of material.
You say that you dont want to make noise for your neighbors but then how do you do other projects without disturbing them
He needs to make sure he doesn’t suffocate in the hole
A core drill would be quiet and pulling 150mm × 500mm cores at a time would be quick
If only Andy Dufresne had youtube in prison ..
What a lovely considerate crazy Colin. Never met a Colin like this.
I love how much you've grown (yt wise)
this man really in a hole acting like his shop is quiet on a normal day
If there a zombie apocalypse im coming to u
What determination..
LEGEND!
I would watch Colin do an Ad for anything
check out WW2 trenching pick axe. ideal for loosening soil.
It’s really interesting how different he is after the lockdown. I hope you’re doing good my dude
This is… so legit. Jesus
how does your back not hurt
If you hear water flow, lava flow, or mobs, then you know there is a secret cave.
He should try a powered post hole digger with a lawnmower in the yard to cover any noise
It’s not really a secret if we know.
One bit of advice Colin is just don’t die that’s all
Anybody else worried about his hearing? I never see him wearing hearing protection and all I can think is the crazy guys going to end up deaf.
Man power
Him saying it’s September, me being happy everything should be done by now, realizing he had to stop of covid and the next vid could be in 2months
I doubt Tom's ever been to a band practice in his entire life
You really missed your chance of pretending to be Captain Jack Sparrow with a jar of dirt 😂
imagine he just hits a giant oil source under his house
Attention to your sponser Freetrade: sort your business out and make yourselves available in my country! New Zealand. Thanks.
Isn’t this Saddam Hussain’s hole the US found him in?
This tunnel is very secret, only every one who sees the video knows about it🤫
*DIGGING A SECRET TUNNEL* 1.2mil people ._.
never dig straight down. Me "theres a draft down earh."
Easy digging right there!
This is an awesome project 👍🏻
Such a cool project!  I wonder how much more efficient an auger would be digging sideways...
Sponsored by Minecraft?
Everyone as a kid, I wish I had a secret tunnel. This guy just makes one.
I'm claustrophobic thinking of those walls caving in or the water table rising and drowning him.
not gonna lie hoping at one point he had secret tunnel from avatar playing, while digging the secret tunnel
next: faster than the wind
"secret tunnel" *several million views and counting*
App isn't available in the US. I tried bud.
this is a fuckin vietnam tunnel
How many dirt have you dug, must be like 100 kg or something or maybe more!!
Your videos always make me so happy
.
you are the best colin, i loved to see that crazy laugh at the end <3
✌️
My childhood dream.
For sideways digging wouldn't some sort of boring machine be helpful? Stabilized by the support beams on the side opposite to the dig. 🤔
This is so awesome.
I love this guy. He’s just the embodiment of what I always wanted to do as a kid.
You need a conveyor to transport the dirt out of the shed into a wagon lol
Great job! Did you check how far away you are from the ground water?
Minecraft rule #1 NEVER dig straight down!
You are one crazy fu*ker!! Love your vids!
Insane!
It puts the lotion on the skin or it gets the hose again.
"secret" underground tunnel. Its all over youtube so not so secret innit 😂
I wana see more Furze band night😁
And on the BBC news "Youtube sensation Colin Furze's body has been recovered from under tonnes of earth, by mine rescue experts, after his foray into amateur tunnelling resulted in a tunnel collapse!"
I can do this in 20 seconds with my bare hands, in Minecraft.
2:15 Strange Piles of Earth appearing in Stamford
when this is done you need to fill the tunnel with things that go boom (fireworks) THAT would be a epic as hell tunnel opening ceremony!!
Mexican cartels wants to know his location.
Went to get app but it’s not in the AppStore Iam in us btw Apple to
#prisonbreak
Congratulations on 11 mill subs
Part 3 please......like....NOW>.....ahahah cant wait for this to be finished
Where is Saddam Hussien
Why are you so nice to your neighbours lol
Ok, let me get this straight. A fucking chipping jammer or jackhammer is too lpus, but lathes, saws, and all the other crazy shit you get up to isn't?  Are you even legally allowed to be digging this tunnel? Do you have a permit?
Afraid of making noise? You're literally surrounded by metric tons worth of sound insulation, couldn't you rig up an airtight or layered insulation "lid" for your tunnel? Hell, you even have that convenient crack-based tunnel ventilation system up and running so you don't asphyxiate! :3
I love the Great Escape references haha!
Is this legal? Did you encounter many spiders? And how deep and long? Lol
SPUD BAR AND POST HOLE DIGGERS!!!
I'd like to believe he left the box of "cereal" at the market but I know he didn't
3:53 The Alesso Heist
hey colin,  you must have a lot of money now, how come you are still staying in the same home ?  you look like you are living very modest.
minecraft is so misleading. digging in real life is so much work and takes forever
This is like fists to obsidian.
I'm waiting for the moment you put an elevator in.
This is literally minecraft IRL
I love the Shawshank Redemption reference, you also did one with the bunker build if I remember
Your neighbours must hate you
All the fun is had by this man..... cheers you legend.  #FanForLife
Two lovers, forbidden from one another A war divides their people And a mountain divides them apart Built a path to be together  ...Yeah, and I forget the next couple of lines, but then it goes...  Secret tunnel! Secret tunnel! Through the mountain! Secret, secret, secret, secret tunnel! Yeah!
I hope he won't become a mad scientist.He got Evil Lab/Bunker + lots of brain power...
I hope some serial killers don't get any ideas from this channel.
You're probably far enough underground to not have to worry about sound.
goodbye structural integrity.
You just failed no poop july😱
ready for part 3
At 3:50 they look a mafioso diging a grave
Sat here waiting for a hippie to start singing a love song about a secret tunnel.
Nice hole to hide some bodies you got there
Did you consider using an auger for the soft dirt, and what about a large grinding head for the stone?
Mate, you’re off your nut. In a good way!
COLIN! Why haven't you built a time machine yet? I want the next part NOW ✊
Out of curiosity, did you have to get council approval to do this project? What kind of process was involved with that in regards to the legal side of things?
AH the safety tie.
Colin is in actuality building his very own DUMB. 🤔😉😎😆
Awesome, btw what was the depth you are now at ? Also what are you doing with all the dirt ? Because it seamd that you are probably atleast 5m underground and the hole is probably 1,2x1,2 which would be around atleast 7,2 m^3 of dirt, which lets face it is not small amount.
Well it's not much of a secret anymore innit
if theres ever a disaster in england and the queens normal secret bunker is compromised something tells me she will be paying colin a visit
Next is a common project Furze / Mr Tfue building a town underground ? 😅
Why are you wearing neck ties while doing strenuous digging?
Not really a secret if you make a vid about it
I swear colin is just building a drug running business and is just practicing making a drug running tunnel
It's like if you combined ADHD with extreme persistence.
At least you had a decent lockdown project.
Damn, that big crack scared the bejesus out of me. You could literally be digging away, happy out, feel a little suspicious breeze, and next thing you know you're suddenly falling down a bottomless crack and never be seen again.
Oh you funny boy. LOL
Please no one be a Debbie downer and snitch.. 🤬
isnt ironic that you dont want anyone to know ur building this but still post it on youtube to millions of people?
4:00 *wife hears random trumpet sounds from shed*   Colin: There is literally no way this could go wrong.
Wheelbarrow?
I am curious, does Colin actually live at this place or is it his "recording studio" home (and he and his family live somewhere else)?  I am more inclined to think that it is second option as most of the videos I have seen of the inside look like it isn't lived in by a family.  Personally, I would love to have a underground bunker along with a secret tunnel system, especially with weather events like the Pacific North West occurring.  A underground bunker would be a lot easier to keep cool compared to a above ground house and would provide shelter for the semi-regular bushfires that we see here in Australia.
literally never a dull moment
Man oh man, I can't wait for the next one.  Oh, and it's a shame you don't do pottery since I think you moved a small mountain of clay so far.  LOL
There is the Hamas terrorist organization in Gaza they can teach you to dig such a tunnel
If Hogan's Hero's had excavated Oak Island..it might have looked something like this....lol...
make series of holes and vacuum out, see vid. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0MTVVs7QU8
Colin furze is digging to china lolll😎
Vietcong warfare
Where do you get the energy to do this stuff? I wish I could buy some from you.
You should try making shoes with jets on the bottom to make you go up in the air.
Hey, I have a question for you I'm a professional plumber and heavy equipment operator disposing of soil is a major pain in the butt it has to be tested and you need a dep sticker Department of Environmental Protection in order for me to dispose of it when using a commercial vehicle. Is it as difficult in the United Kingdom?
Jesus this man can make anything
This combined with the bunker itself, is just about one of the coolest things on the internet, that is real!
Hopefully you're checking for toxic gas/pipes etc while digging. And like chance of collapse? Cause yeah - stay safe
2:00 do this in america and omg
who else is from canada and this video is the best thing on canada day lol
You migt have an easier time with a sturdy hammer and chisel and/pry bar in place of shovel. No modifications would be needed. Less room needed for productive digging.
Is he hiding the dirt in his pants like in the great escape?  EDIT: this man is a mad genius 😆
1812: your capitol is at risk.
Colin must be having a ripped body with all the heavy work he does °~°
Just go straight down until you find diamonds!
you absolute legend
How deep is the water table there?
Awesome idea but wondering how you're keeping it secret with a YT channel.  A post hole digger would have made a bit of that easier.
SECRET TUNNEL!!! SECRET TUNNEL!!!!
Building a secret tunnel step one:  Buy house built on light, sandy soil.
.....great video !!!
Didn't he attach a plane engine on a giant pole in his backyard to swing upside down? I'm pretty sure the neighbors are used to strange noises coming from his house.
I pay a ransom to YouTube so I don’t have to skip through commercials. Now  I find myself ending the video when there is a “paid advertisement “! WTF?!?!
.....................next project trip to MARS !!!
Bro. Build a conveyor belt to move the soil to the garden.
One of the most annoying people on the face of the planet.
Why no wheel barrow?
Any idea of the crack and how far down it went?
I have never once seen a single person with so much shear creativity and willingness to put in so much effort into something like this, It's amazing and inspiring to say the very brim of words I can use to define this.
Ah, the Great Escape. Not the most amazing escape, but definitely the greatest. The most amazing goes to the guy that escaped a German POW camp for high risk, former escapees in a Chateau. He built a glider and flew from the top room of one of the towers he had found a way into over the walls and some distance from the perimeter of the camp, past the final wire fence.
Hey… You need a conveyor belt
Three comments: 1. This is basically a WW2 mining reenactment 2. Colin still has neighbors? Wow 3. If Colins house ever gets sold the real estate agents are going to have their work cut out for them! Might get snagged by a supervillan.
"I cover noise of making secret tunnel" says man who always makes tons of strange noise *and* is literally posting about it on the internet XD
Has this guy never heard of a wheel borrow?
beware of carbon monoxide
Should make your vids longer
Feel like irl minecraft when you try to dig straight down in order to mine ores
How many times have your neighbors complained to council about you 😂😂🤣 you must the worst neighbor 😂🤣  This is one of those projects you dream about as a kid, I'm so jealous.
Builds a "secret" underground tunnel, then posts it on the internet. Nice!
Anyone else hearing the song "SECRET TUNNEL" frome 'Avatar The Last Air Bender'? 😂
Totally off topic, but a steam powered generator(or some other type of heat transferring generator, liquid salts or whatever) using heat from lava could power tourists devices and drones for free(secondary use). If I was mounted on a you beaut cherrypicker, it could be safely positioned over the lava, and moved when necessary.   If the cherrypicker was electric, it could constantly be recharged. It could also be used to power some sort of furnace that lava could be place into, so the cooling rate could be controlled. I'm sure geologist, volcanologists and scientists in general would love to use something like this. I know I would, imagine the types of crystal's that could be made. The usefulness of this will only be limited to imagination.   Anyway, just a half baked idea. Pass it on if you know someone in Iceland that might be interested.
Lets all meet up at his house during the apocalypse
It puts the lotion in the crane operated basket...
I thought he may have built an air lance and and an oversized vacuum system to move the spoil.
damn this really makes me just wanna dig a hole.
So the safety guy in me is screeeaming. For the love of God weld on solid steel and back fill with cement.  That soil is mostly clay and probably won't collapse as is but a few saturating storms and the clay will expand into the shaft.  I like your content and would be very sad if you buried yourself.
Is that a Hitachi jackhammer...
cool vid
Ok seriously though Colin, what did you do with the extra dirt? Can't wait to see the rest!
Laughing so hard at all the dirt disposal methods. It reminded me of my high school days. Our science room chairs were tubular steel with plastic end caps. A friend and I had an ongoing project to discreetly fill each chair with water. The idea was that it would be our legacy - in years to come the plastic feet would wear and rusty puddles would appear - and everyone would be saying "what the..."
good work my guy💯💪💪
I knew he was going to do a reference to the great escape, thank you for not disappointing me Colin.
Introducing the world’s slowest jackhammer
What is Colin gonna do if he wants to move? lmao
Colin is soooo smart.  But apparently he doesn’t know what a CONFINED SPACE is etc..... This is sooo dangerous for soooo many reasons.
"It rubs the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again"
SECRET TUNNEL! SECRET TUNNEL THROUGH THE BACKYARD  SECRET SECRET SECRET SECRET  TUNNEL!!
Can you make this a daily upload!!!
wow not even using manpower to dig. boring
Wait if this is "secret tunnel" and he is talking about it on the internet, then what are the real "secret" secret projects? Can someone send some Interpol, FBI, KGB, and CIA over there? You know... just to be... sure.
Please do look into that crack and cave thing you found thats insane.
Can't wait to see the development
Just get some cartel members to do it for you, they'll get that shit done fast.
Colin did you have to get planning permission to do this? Would be interesting to know how that went down as I imagine it was an unusual request to be put in for planning permission.
I am beyond excited about this project!!!
Absolutely wonderful 💗😁
It looks like the well in Buffalo Bills house in Silence of the Lambs
it seems like it would be cheaper to rent a holiday spot, gift it to your neighbors, and send them for a week in spain. then just get as much as you can get done. Also sound proof the hatch and you might be fine?
the next owners of his house will be so confused
square shovel to dog? hmmm
Always working on something...
What happened to the crack
This is awesome haha
Di rumah gue belum sampe 2 meter udah keluar air kalau digali gini
I have never seen a higher level of commitment for an F-ing YouTube video. This is so much more work than the bunker was. It's human hands doing this not backhoes. Collin you deserve all the billions of subscribers you've got 👍😆
😃😃BE BLESSED x 1,000,000!!!🙏🙏🙏😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃🙏😃😃🙏🙏🙏🙏😃😃😃
This is so enthralling.  Did you ever find out more about the crack / crevasse?
“Secret underground tunnel” …1 million views
Did ever discover where the big crack lead too yet?
SIIIICK!
This is just CRAZY BUT AMAZING LOL carnt wait for MORE MORE MORE
WHAAAAAAAGHGH!  Good on you, Minecraft for nerds, I love it!
perfect hobby。。 digging tunnel during lockdown...
Cheers good sir for using the scene from Great Escape.
This is an awesome project! Looking forward to part 3... 12:16 - Anyone here can point me to this piece of music?
If you use a post hole drill it will make it heaps faster and easier. And you can get long hole saws for your drill that might help too.
I half expected Colin to build a TBM during lockdown!
If it’s limestone you could use heaps of vinegar to dissolve the limestone. That could be a way to eat the bulk of it and stay quiet
Beau would be so proud of you. When are you getting Aquachigger over
Remember when Colin’s projects weren’t completely bonkers. Me neither.
But where did the crack lead?  What was causing the draft in the downshaft?
This man still uses an iPhone 5 in 2021
9:49 If I had to guess a lot of that nonsense looks like solid clay, so you've been getting a hell of a workout since that stuff is HEAVY.
Doing that without shoring is..... risky
Was hoping you'd make a small tbm!
Love your ideas and energy, and this idea is a good one.   I think you need to some kind of platform elevator which uses some kind of Pressure Plate to trigger/energize the platform and ( perhaps a double toe-tap to trigger the platform to go up and down ) then install multiple odd opening doors inside the tunnel just like the ones from the classic old school TV show "Get Smart" !!!!!!
I wonder if he got a permit or decided screw it let’s make a tunnel
Colin: Your Capitol is at risk! Americans: Again!?
Great edit dude!
This guy completes me 😍
Never dig straight down their might be lava
Is it really a secret if you make a video about it??? 🤔
1:35 bruh. Dudes straight up fondling his hog
Outstanding, miraculous, absolute total respect.  Fantastic viewing pleasure.  Thank you.  Regards Gareth Wiltshire UK. Gratitude. Quality. Respect.
its almost like he has the voice of god in his head telling him to do this lol why else would anyone go to these lengths
He should have a garden as well underground
I was just about to type how awesome Mr Colin's content is as the video was ending, then at 13:42 it said "TURNING THE INTERNET UP TO 11 SINCE 2006". He nailed it before I touched my keyboard.
Colin is a legend
🔥🔥🔥🔥
us during 2020: in our homes doing nothing colin: digs a giant fucking hole
Great video! I think your neighbours might know now though
how about vacuum excavation, its quite common nowadays
omg when is part 3!?!?!
I don’t even get that excited when my wife takes her pants off
Man really said el Chapo
I'm pretty sure you are a bit crazy, it's not a bad thing.
The mesh will stop small cave ins. But what is going to be the finished walls...concrete?? And how are you going to support the horizontal tunnel ? Don't want to read about crazy builder getting killed by cave in :(
Bruh imagine the real estate listing when this guy sells his house
I want to know how the city feels about your shenanigans with bunkers and tunnels. How did you get approval for this?
Why didn't it full up with water?
I want to see this Terraforming in a videogame (other than minecraft)
I guess the anthem for this series would be “SECRET TUNNEEELL” from ATLA?
Worried about noise? I would think that by now your neighbors would be MORE worried when it's quiet.
for your own sake, put some radon detectors in there
Y not use A drill to loosen the dirt
I kind of expected your neighbors to watch your channel.
When he moves house, someone's in for a treat
My dude over here playing minecraft with RTX on
i wonder if he could have used loud tools by sound isolating the door, since the ground around him should be really absorbing and not letting anything up.
"Secret" tunnel.  Starts with a map of the Secret Tunnel.  That's like Chemtrails, the government conspiracy to poison us all with sky writing, in secret.
This absolutely blows my mind This is by far the craziest project ever keep it up man, you stayed true to yourself and still make great content
Colin you are a sucker for punishment.
Time for the tunnel boring machine… come on Colin you can make one. My son Garrett suggest making it rocket powered.😂
Thats no joke, mate.. This indeed is getting exciting, i wish i could purchase your house after u passed decades from now!!!! So jealous, some cool stuff at your place!
could you put some really good sound insulation on the lid and then the neighbors couldnt hear the jackhammer
Hello i'm from indonesia
Really interested in the geology of the crack you discovered. Any more information on that?
Wild project! I would love to do this also but I think that's a little bit too hard 🤣 Good luck and please don't die 😆
Why and why?
Ok air coming in through a crack in the limestone about 2 meters down. Is it just me or do other people see flooding issues in the future? Colin might just need a swim mask and fins to go from one place to the other in the future.
As a Danish person from Denmark whose mother tongue is the Danish language, I have never ever heard of "The Danish Invader" did they get lost at sea or what?
I went to my dad's house one day and he was about 7' down (installing a car hoist) with the end of his shop vac. Works great on dry soil. Had about 15' of hose to get out of the garage. You need to take the filter out.  He cut stopes into the walls to get out to empty the vacuum.
Hey Colin I built a full basement under my house using two electric garden cultivators and 5 gallon buckets once I got down to the base level I was able to put the buckets along the bottom of the wall and run the electric cultivator across where I was digging so the dirt would just fall into the buckets I did finish it with concrete block and poured a concrete floor it turned out beautiful. I jacked up the house and replaced the supports as I progressed. I only put one rip across the wall in the Lath and plaster when I settled the house onto the new peer  block prematurely, I ended up tearing up the walls in the house and insulating anyways. I built a ramp from the outside to down below to slide in blocks and concrete but I ended up having to cut my concrete mixer into pieces to get it back out.
How is this even Minecraft related
Hi I would be drilling since your at a point that you can go forward then make a track for a drill too sit on that way you could do 600mm deep with say 100 mm incriminate giving you ease to knock out with less noise
Wear a hard hat bruh.
My only query is did he get planning permission,,,,took me 3 years to get planning for a basement
Legend has it Tom Waits wrote "What's He Building in There" about Colin
Colin, you weren't wearing your safety tie for most of the video!
You went to all this effort and you still didn't upgrade from a ladder to a staircase.
Honestly i was expecting some elaborate dirt conveying system. Big enclosed auger or something.
Did the draft have a sulpherous smell?
Daft question here don’t you technically need planning permission for that ?
Should've used an earth auger to loosen up that soil.
It's so secret he put it on the internet for everybody to watch
yo dont make this man mad he knows how to hide a body😂
An electric chipping hammer would work better
Build a underground workshop? =P
That is some very nasty clay.
This proves to me that there is no way Batman could dig out a giant Batcave and fill it with bat shit all by himself.
This guy has to be an undercover comedian
Colin: tries to make as little noise as possible and hide it from his neighbors Also Colin: lemme post into YouTube so millions of people can watch it
Just an fyi a powered ice augur works great for digging holes
My gosh son, this a quietly epic thing you have taken on!
ROFL 🤣🤣🤣 Better get ready for the nosey neighbors and the Constable to drop by, being that it has been way too peaceful, quite, and, normal for "your" house......lololol!!😆😆😂
If the next video shows you building a full-on tunnel boring machine I won't be surprised.
Can’t believe you’ve had a giant hole in your workshop for a year in all your videos!
Fucking Sweet!!!!    I'd like to know how you got all the permits for this? What does the your city think of this?
2 days of building and modifying tools 6 hours of digging :)
You're getting a complimentary 30 day trial from Audible:https://amzn.to/3duxDGF
Who’s gona tell him they make shovel attachments for hammer drills
I’m surprised he didn’t hit any electrical wires
Dig deeper into the cave! Very interesting what is there!
I feel like Colin and Michael reeves should collaborate on something
Fucking hell. Amazing work
Ayyy Saddam how ya doin'
This is amazing fr
My man is digging a tunnel with a tie on and shorts
*YOUR CAPITOL IS AT RISK*
as a 7th year trombonist that "band practice night" really hurt my soul
Dudes INSANE. love it - rock on!!!!
Does anyone knows what is the music playing at 12:16 ?
I didnt know colin was in "The Great escape".
So that’s how Boris Johnson styles his hair!
When the guy who stood on his shed roof with a flamethrower guitar is suddenly wanting to not make make noise.  The neighbors: "He's up to something..."
My neighbor complains my fence is too high 🙄
and next expand with an underground greenhouse for ultimate pandemic survival.
El chapo should hire this guy.
Ever going to figure out where that draft was coming from?
"I've got to be quiet because I don't want anyone hearing that I'm digging a secret tunnel" he says on his youtube channel with 11 million subscribers         I commented this before the part where he says it's september
🎶secret tuuneeeel🎶
its legal?? hahahah

he need to get monecraft steve
Now all the bi*ch needs is a  gaming set up and a minifige.
I say again where was the great escape soundtrack?
SELL THE DIRT  = $$$$$$
If you're trying to get this done quicker I know a couple guys with some experience building underground houses with pools 😌
I think this project's turning the internet up to a 12!
Hmmm secrets don't last long on YouTube
I tried digging a tunnel myself when I was a kid.  Even had it traversible for a time, but I was an idiot & dug it outside.  And for some reason, whenever I wanted to do stuff outside, every few days it would rain, and not just rain, but pour like clockwork, so the tunnel always got flooded & mucky, and then eventually I had to fill it back in.  But now that I'm older, I've still got that dream, and hope to actually do it someday.  It'd be awesome.
You're supposed to put the lotion in the basket not the rocks and rubbish.
Builds a secret tunnel. Posts a video of him building it on a channel with 11 million subs.
i like you but you sure could have taken a better sponsor. promoting stock trade is almost like promoting gambling.. this kind of advertisement is not even allowed in many countries. so possible the video is going to blocked in certain countries.
How did you get planning permission lol
i would check to see if there are pipe's in the way of the "Secret Tunnel"
I hope whoever lives in this house after him I really hope that they don't know about all this and one day find it
watching this I thought of using an Archimedes screw - might be a little late
fuccs sake youre nuts timmy.
Collin: SECRET TUNNEEEEEL, SECRET TUNNEEEEL Everyone on youtube: Facepalm
you should dress as steve of minecraft
You could of gone to Skegness and got a bucket and spade
Nice work mate you would be a good gold miner 🍻👍🍀⛏
Waiting for you to hit that "shared sewer" that nobody knew about, not even the water board!
"Secret" 1 000 000 views doesn t look secret XD
All you had to do was hire a couple of El Chapo's guys and you'd have a tunnel with lights and a rail in about 8 hours
Why does he not want the neighbours to hear?
You need to borrow a boring machine from Elon Musk
Wackness.
Only Colin Furze would dig wearing a shirt and tie 😂
how the hell do you get consent for that?... I cant even build a second bathroom without passing through a mile of red tape! 🤣
Brilliant. I’m going to start work on my own. Only issue I’m in a flat on the first floor. Negotiating with the neighbour below currently to see if I can install a shaft down through his living room 👍
The face my dog made to that trombone lmao I think you need more practice
Im starting to think this might not be so secret anymore
british rock is horrible
6:09 that's what she said
Anyone else see this and think is that Jason Nash? Idk
This man literally crazy 😧
This is a secret tunnel besides the 11million subs I have 😬
i saw him struggle t o lift the dirt and was think he bouta make a way to lift that shit aND HE DID IT
colinfurze? more like, coolinfurze
The point when Colin hit rock bottom
..ado I see some Indian artifacts?
Found you; that was the last clue I needed.   Sorry, it’s a game I play, with my self😅 to find YouTubers studio/house/office/… on google maps, from only clues found in videos.
"I've got a jar of dirt"
Use your hydraulic system and attach a drill on the ram. You can get a good worm gear set and get to it!
What a project!   Super cool!!
minecraft
12:36 omfg it’s the bat-cave elevator 😱😱
OSHA would not approve...

Is it just me, or did anyone else notice the recycled video section where he installs the hydro pump under the workbench. That's just a clip from a video from a few years ago
It just makes me remember the secret entrances you build in your singleplayer minecraft world, it might not be entirely be necessary but it adds to the charm of your base/hpuse
dude has 11 million subs and still trying to hide that hes digging a tunnel from his neighborhood by playing a trumpet. excellent content as usual
I would literally buy some of that dirt if you put it in the store
If you and stuff made here collabed I seriously think you could take over the world
The best way to get the dirt out the best way is to loosen it and vacuum it out and drop the dirt in the trash
I think what you need to have is a jackhammer so you could drill down into the ground it might work you could always make one
10:23 You have heard of the Bat Cave but, now you will hear of the Colin Cave! *theme music plays*
Can we talk about the sock bit at 1:36. I had to stop the video because I gotta process how that looked
Random comment for the YouTube algorithm.
1:35 Damn Colin got the schmonster schmeat
mid september? bruh what
An ice auger would have been a huge help.
Going to tell my kids that Colin Furze has dug all the coal mine shafts in my area 😂
Should have used a diamond core drill.
Get yourself a crow bar Colin, makes digging deep holes much easier
14 min video with a minute and a half of add. Love the content but was hoping to see more.
Dude's just playing Minecraft irl
this would be soo easy if this were minecraft XD
My capitol is at risk?? Not again!  *catches next flight to Washington DC*
The level this guy is at and still has a shed for a shop.  and a tiny yard.  I would have upgraded to the country side along time ago
Pretty sure, El-Chapo is one of the likes on this video.
This is why I love free trade been a user for ages but to sponsor something like this madness just shows how epic they are
Pump motor might need a little air flow for cooling.
Colin will soon be the worlds strongest plumber.
my mans is making a mighty IRL minecraft base
Legit I got a share worth £25 and it's made me even more molar. Cheers Colin, keep diggin 😁 (in the past) 💕
This is crazy, but great
A jackhammer with a shovel bit works great
Are you kidding me. Made a tunnel boring machine😄
Building a secret tunnel step one.Post it on YouTube and tell everybody about it.
Now that's cool !
You'll be finished before Cross Rail! 😅
Colin: “can’t be too loud I don’t want to bother people.” Also Colin: “uses loud power tools to build quiet one.”
9:05 - Jesus, check out those toned engineer arms.
Whats wrong with a breaker, wheelbarrow or a conveyer so it doesn't take all year
I just hope hes using a drill to go sideways
Please let this come out of a closet
Do you need help
Minecraft IRL
I just discovered your channel, I want to help.  Please use a electric pneumatic hammer drill with a spade.  U can dig quick 🇨🇦👍 cheers 🍻
If you ask a man to dig a hole he will dig  that hole until he can't get out. If it's group of dudes. No whole knows how big that hole will be
Ur nuts forsure! Pretty cool I like nutters😉
Colin secretly getting ready for when the sun has a mini nova this 12,000 year sun cycle. Eyes open, no fear lol
Madness! P.s Link doesn't work for sponsor
Hope you had planning permission for that 🤣. Fantastic 👏
Awesome
If I were Colin's neighbors I'd be more worried when I /don't/ hear him! BTW: If my "Capitol" is at risk, that is a national security concern right?
Hope ya neighbour doesn't use youtube ;)
How do you get permits for this... do you not need inspections for building this!? It's awesome btw but im just really jealous!
How long till he realizes that it isn't a secret tunnel when he releases it for every one to see
Fun fact no one has made a minecraft joke yet
Doesn't anyone else wonder where the crack went ??
One day this house is gonna go on the market and I cannot wait to see the description
My house sit's on solid rock. I can't dig to my bunker.
It rubs the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.
Not so secret now is it?
What is the piece playing at 12:18?
Im quite curious about that crack as well now. Where it comes from and all.
Molesting the shovel at 3:22
I wonder is that tunnel permitted?
Colin's neighbors are never there when he's building this stuff so it means that they leave one day and they come back to pure insanity...
Please tell us the story of how you Told your wife what you were doing.
Anyone know the songs used at all?
It’s secret until it’s now on YouTube
Colin you're like.... 10 feet underground? More? I don't think anyone's gonna hear you mate
The bloke at the tip must be wondering why Colin keeps turning up each day with 8 tubs of soil in his car.
I think I saw this on Better Call Saul. It's a methlab, isn't it.
Let’s be honest here, noise isn’t a huge concern because the neighbours long ago made peace with the fact they live next to a madman with an engineering shop in his shed
Might have been interesting but the so called music blasting runs everything. Even if it had been music I liked the fact it was blasting would make the video blow.
You really need a  ventilation system in there dude...
Part 3: Colin is in the hospital with q broken back
i wonder how many hard drugs he does while doing these projects
Diggers With Attitude
This was EXACTLY the kind of thing my brother and I used to do when we were kids: designing underground dens - and then digging down about two feet before we either got tired or dad went mental (not a good idea to do it in the back garden using his tools).
should have built an auger and a conveyor belt.
Would have loved to download FreeTrade because I've been looking at getting into investing lately, but alas 'tis not available in my country. Glad they could sponsor, but shame it's region locked. Funny video, Furzy!
The real reason the lockdown was lifted.. so the Furze can keep digging
I’m unhappy living in America. Where should I move to?
I have often thought of digging a similar tunnel from my shed to my house. Just need to dig a long way through sold rock.
Colin, for the love of all that is sacred: Ventilation, ventilation, VENTILATION!  I know you've probably done most of the work already but if you're still down there digging underground you are in a confined space and air can become stale and toxic VERY quickly, particularly if you hit an underground gas pocket that will then contaminated your working air supply.
Are you tunnelling to Australia?
It's a flashback to the movie "Lady Killers"
This is such an awesome series !!! I’m genuinely excited for the next episode !
I wonder how this affects the land value
Hi Colin, just curious why you didn't built a conveyor system to transport all the dirt outside? That will be much fun for your back 😜. a Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM) that will be awesome...
Wait, didn't he already have a hydraulic pump under the table?
dude is savage
“Secret” 1000000 people know about it
You are  mad 🤣Legend love the vids 👍👍👍
No electric JCB? would have been ideal for this
This one finally made me subscribe
Complete silence dude 30ft underground
Follow that Crack! see where it leads too
And the city or municipality hasnt said anything? or they're just none the wiser. I am amazed. Astounded, jelous, impressed, Jelous, excited JEALOUS! KEEEEEPPP DIGGGINGGGGGG!!!!!! I want to see every rick come out. I will be subscribing and I wonder if this increases property value? XD
Can you not get a hammer drill spade? I think that would save you a lot of heart ache  and noise
As a kid growing up on beaches, if I see someone digging a large hole, i can’t help but see what’s going on
Hydro power would be plenty for a nice big Archimedes screw to lift the spoil. Nice'n'quiet too, and it could even be left to its' own devices for a bit. Ideal for a 'band practice' moment.
Love the videos, but fuck me that is dangerous. I am surprised you haven't been visited by the HSE. Working in an unsupported excavation is so so dangerous and now tunnelling under your garden and house in near surface limestone with no experience. Would hate to see something bad happen.
Is this legal?? 😂
Like your neighbours are going to question a jack hammer going off in your house
10:30 Is this Reign of Fire (2002) reference or something? 😅
You sir are a mad man, thanks you for all your content, easily the best channel on the internet
I'm still waiting for him to build like a dregde bucket line chainsaw hybrid
What you going to do when the world falls in
1 mil views in 7 hours damn!
Colin is a brilliant fabricator but here he is carrying dirt in buckets in and out of his shed I’m confused
4:54 Oh no, the building where the state legislative body meets is at risk!
*I'm anticipating the reaction of the person who takes the kellogg off that shelf*
Honestly, if I lived next door to Colin I'd be much more worried when I DON'T hear him.
I have been watching quite a few of his videos, some good, some bad, most sort of stupid. This one has to top the stupid section and I decided not to watch anything anymore
You have been added to the fbi watch list
Secret tunnel that more than 1 million peopme knows now
Amazing pretty sure every kid growing up wanted to do this I no I had many attempts just not sure I can wait for the next video its as hard as waiting for the next session  of stranger things. to come out
When is part 3 going to be up?
Its got kind of a "it rubs the lotion on its skin" vibe.....
To me that's scary as hell 😳
I really can't wait till Sunday please upload before 😬😬🤣🤣
Surprised he didn't build a tunnel boring machine and show it digging tunnels for him. Like all over the neighborhood.
One of the best damn channels on YouTube...   keep up the awesome work!
I don’t think it’s a secret if over 1 million people know about it
el chappo enterz the chat
I don't want the neighbors to find out. (publishes it publicly on the internet to 11 million subscribers, and anybody else who cares to watch)
Wonder how much noise it would actauly make at the neighbors with powertools down there.
I would have thought you would have built a conveyor belt and bucket system to help move the dirt.
That crack almost looked like it had building blocks on the side of it. Did you ever figure out what it was?
What’s the point in being quite, to not get caught? I mean your a pretty famous guy
Is this his job or does he have an actual job, does anybody know? Also did he go to college/uni?
wtf are cocoa pops~!??
How do you have the attention span to commit to this?? I would have gotten bored and moved on after the 3rd dig 😄
Pfff. I can do it in minecraft in 2 seconds.
Do sound proof boards lessen the sound of jackhammer hitting stone?   An easy way to dampen sound so u can work a little louder
next project i would like to see is colin furze to build an iron man suit. he is surely crazy enough to at least try :)
Where did the cave lead? D:
It needs an automatic carpet roller!
I always wonder what could Colin possibly build next then boom out comes this project
Fantastic!
Forgive me if this has an obvious answer, but are we allowed to just dig, what about water and gas lines?
If the project is "2 1/2 months away from being a year old" in mid September 2019, he started this in November 2018. Holy cow, it's been a secret project, behind the scenes for almost  2 AND A HALF YEARS!!! Damn!
bloody rich people
Best series you’ve ever done by far! Loving it!
if this was me, i would have lost interest 3 feet down lol
i feel like he knows when the end of the world is
Okay but what the hell was that crack?
“Chop it down 6 inches” if that’s 6 inches then there’s no hope
Absurd madman
Can you send me some of the dirt
Goin' to be another 2 yrs before we see the end of this 😂😂 Stay tuned everyone
Not a secret anymore! ☹️
Yeah Mr beast can give away a million dollars, but can he dig a tunnel from his underground bunker to his house singlehandedly?
not installing lifts on the hatch is pretty ballsy lol. if that thing slams shut when you are in there, and the tunnel is deep enough, you would have a hell of a time getting it open
wowwwww
What's the name of the song in the March April lockdown ?
Basically Gordon Ramsay of building things
Hey Colin i got a world changing invention but i need your Help !! Please help me and the world
IRL Minecraft LOL
Wow, I completely called it nearly a year ago.... https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp68_FLety0O-n9QU6phsgw/community?lc=UgxQqsQjeRX6Di3Lynp4AaABAg&lb=Ugx_QTCHuEWTdKEENZN4AaABCQ  Sounds like this project was already well underway when I made that comment though.  ....Definitely voting you as shed of the year next year (and every year).
This guy don't do things by halves. He's got just as much below ground as he does above 😂
I always wonder if there is an easier way to dig. Maybe a pressure washer and a wet-vac that recycles the water as much as possible. or maybe some sort of drill in a chisel tube hooked to a vacuum.
Ahh....to be young again.....
Did you need permits for this?
If minecraft has taught me anything, never dig straight down!
I was expecting you to hit a Roman Villa under there.
My back hurts just watching this!
It isnt really secret if you post it on youtube
Love it great work
how the heck do you have the energy to do all that digging......scratch that I see.
I'm not going to surprise if he build entire underground metro
You should consult with HAMAS specialists about digging tunnels.  They are professionals.  Love your channel
Hopefully  the neighbors  don't find your channel...
Colin, you are industrious and utterly crazy.
what about using the screw tanks wel screw as a drill youd probably have to beef them up a bit but itd make a decent dirt mover
That crack reminded mi of the No:1 rule in minecraft...  NEVER DIG STRAIGHT DOWN
Hole 🙏🙌🕺🏿
Colin hurry up with the videos man I'm loving this.... You are living the dream!! "
Please stop abusing the brass instruments.
There's not one video where he doesn't build something!
#mincraft? Lol
How has the misso passed on this idea
secret tunnel and 1million wiews XD
Good timing my friend I was just about to skip, because of your command I watched through the whole thing. I hope you feel appreciated.
0:40 hydroneer gameplay
I Dig It !!! KOKO (Keep On Keepin’ On)!
Amazing...like it
Imagine the value of this house if he decides to sell it.
me diggin
That trumpet timing 😂
Colin for your safety you need a gas or co2 detector and ventilation even down to where you are that draft could be natural gasses just be aware. good luck.
This is so so cool.
Sounds like a sick person's dream creation.
Make a handheld rotary shovel, like a mini excavator.
I love it he says he wants to build a secret tunnel that no one knows about then posts it all over YouTube 🤣🤣
i imagined him to make a machine that would just dig te tunnel for him
You should have hired one of those guys in the "Jungle". They could have had the entire tunnel dug in about 20 minutes, or less.
This guy is completely nuts
I dont know where Colin lives, or the geology of the location, but one side of me thinks "lucky bugger has got circulated air in a closed limestone hole. maybe even a cave!" While the other side of me went "Now hear me out, what if that's a fault?" Only an amateur geologist,  but I don't like seeing  those neat little details without considering all possibilities.
the video title: "secret tunnel" also the video: *number 8 on trending*
So this explains the sudden subsidence of Colins neighbouring property 🤔
Colin: I'm gonna build a bunker under my house with tunnels. Planning officer: erm yeah sure you are mate, I tell you what just do it quietly so no one knows. Colin: seriously? Yes mate will do Planning officer: yeah he was blatantly sent by the guys down stairs because it's my first day. A few days later Colin: I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole, diggy diggy hole, digging a hole...
Why cut down a shovel for use in the tunnel? Use a spoon like a real professional lol!
Quick before the hyenas come
Anyone else wonder how it’s possible to keep white shirt so clean?
Any particular reason that Colin hasn't tried to shoutout to pewdiepie to use the trebuchet? pewdiepie has always said he wants to use one and it'd be a great boost for this channel I love so much!
Anyone else getting some great escape vibes
The lengths Colin will go to to avoid a rejected planning application. I'm surprised this video isn't 4/10 years after completion 😂
Hi Colin, what about a post hole digger attached to a hydraulic spinny thing and a vacuum pipe to suck the dirt to the surface. ?
Get a gas auger to break it up first. 8 or 12 inch diameter. Work smart, not hard.
I was beginning to wonder what Colin us up to, there must be a big project somewhere deep down. I guess I was right :D
awesome brother
I actually love your videos ngl man you always make my day 10x better lol.
Is it really THAT loud? You’re like 4 meters under the surface + you also have the shed on top, which probably also absorbs a bit of sound.
I keep on worrying about cave-ins...  Oh, and ear protection while you're operating a jackhammer (especially in a small space) is a must.
Lol a secret tunnel that everyone who has watched this video knows about. I love it.
not very secret if you are showing it to millions of people
COLIN!!! Hydraulic Augers surely my mate???? Easy and quiet system to rig up with great digging and extracting qualities
I LOVE you and your projects Colin. Keep em going!
This is almost as good as the knife that cuts bread and toasts it at the same time!   Can't wait to see the next episode.
Also could u perhaps live when digging the next part?
Him vacuuming his hair: WHERE'S YOUR JET ENGINE???!?!!?
Hey just wondering whens next upload date?
What a brilliant video
Colin add a lift shaft
Make a tunnel boring machine, slow revolutions could be quiet.
I swear he plays Minecraft
Question, why is the reason you need to be quite and have the loud music going?
👍👍from this guy
This is one of the best things you've done on your channel mate!! I can not wait to see the next episodes!!
How have you managed to get planning permission for this hah
Im very excited for this one
Makes you think, doesn't it, how much work goes into building the tunnels people use to sneak you drugs into the country! 😉
You didn't do any digging because of the lockdown? I thought that would be the PERFECT time to dig more, when everyone's locked in, anyway? Why did you stop then???
1:46 hows colin put these dirt on cereal box and then we get a real cereal and put it the cereal box with dirt on the market damn.😂😂😂
How cool to build a mini mole digger like they had in the channel tunnel. A project worthy of the colin
This guy is unreal love it
Colin, google, "world war 1 clay kickers".
I would love to see you send a camera attached to a cable through crack to see where it goes.
Should probably have worn a helmet while using that winch. Those rubber bucket handles have a tendency to snap...
Punk as ffffffff
Correct me if I'm wrong but didn't you already have a hydraulic system in your shed? Or has this project been going on for that long in secret? 🤭
Just thinking Colin should of used a long graphter to help break the clay 😂 that's what I always use.m helps a tremendous amount
I like the fact that he is building a secret tunel and he uploads it on yt and his neighbours will see that bruhh
Everyone else is probably thinking what a cool project and then there's me thinking how you got this approved by the council as they're normally very strict on what things you can do on your own land 😂
Imagine doing all that digging, and that "Crack" turned out to be some ancient ruins and Furze had to stop. lol
13:36
If your neighbours watch your latest YouTube videos then they'll know what's going on anyway, so you might as well just make as much noise as you want...
Just have a real good ventilation if you're running a pump down there
The great escape! Next build a boring machine :-)
I suppose this project would the reason on the inconsistent uploads 😂
Can you call it "secret" if you make a video all about it and put it on the internet? Specially when you have 10+ million subscribers
Secret tunnel! Secret tunnel! Through the mountain, ohhh yeah!!!!
it puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.
Man I'm so hyped for "Secret Tunnel Part 7: Dismantling Lincolnshire County Council's Planning Department"
😅
This is definitely the most furze project you could furze together. "To furze" is now a verb, similar to "to cobble", but with 500% more punk.
I’m surprised he hasn’t engineered a mini tunnel boring machine
Clearly Colin hasn’t played Minecraft before.
Local British man digs hiden tunnel fearing the worst
*disclaimer* please dont leave unattended bags in public places and run away with an evil laugh, like an absolute legend mad man 😂😂
Just the boys digging a hole.
Is anyone else deja-vu from when he built the beach hut?
Will it flood when it rains ?
Will you please help me dig mine? I love your attitude to this kind of work. Keep up the great channel mate, really enjoying it 👍😀
Well now I know why my Coco Puffs tasted like dirt.
Super looney tunes?
how deep exactly is "maximum depth" and why is it "maximum" ?
This is turning into my favorite project 🤘
Bit weird only one of you playing the instrument in band practice. I as a neighbour would go and look to see who died.
How about building a small boring machine?
Today on the fabulously fantasic fabrication of Furzes Colin cave, Colin accidentally finds the world of the mole men.   Colin shows them some of his gadgets, and they leave, terrified. Colin now has a tunnel that goes between the houses, as well as an ex mole man's lair.
Why dont you use some wheelbarrows instead of buckets hahaha
You may very well be one of the most hardcore dudes on earth.
it puts the lotion on its skin
Just realized that buying a home doesn’t just give you land for a house to stand on but also land to dig an inverted skyscraper from. Nice.
I was thinking Colin you would build TBM (Tunnel boring machine) for this rather than digging it by hand!
you do everything me as a kid wanted to do. thanks for fulfilling my dreams
Colin's slowly turning into the evil mastermind with the hidden underground bunker, and secret passages
Sooo cool
Am I the only one that believes at this point Colin's neighbors wouldn't bat an eye at an excavator in his back yard let alone a little digging.  I would think the fact he's finally being quiet would draw more attention. :)
Its very exciting to see a tunnel being dug. You should however be well informed of the dangers involved with tunneling. Your soil looks pretty cohesive; clay and rocks, not to bad a ground. No groundwater to be seen either. So that is also a big plus.   You want to support the ground every 3 feet or so with some big sturdy beams. So it wont be coming down on you. If you make the tunnel a bit bigger, you could use some molds and make the tunnel out of concrete with some rebar in it. Or use steel like you did with your bunker, and maybe use some grout (thin  concrete) to pump behind the steel tunnel liner, so everything is nice and snug (safe). You could also do that with your shaft you dug already!   Greetings,   Jeff
im sure there is an easier way thats already been thought of. lolo
*Vietnam flashback intensifies*
Why not a hydraulic or electric auger? I mean. You could technically use a post hole digger to drill out deep holes sideways and then use a shovel to dig the rest of it out?
You should have built a conveyer belt first to transfer the dirt to a waiting dump truck
Everyone needs a secret lair.
Have you ever thought about buying a vacation home in Coober Pedy, South Australia ?
uhh... might I suggest a trolley/wheelbarrow system rather than the buckets? might be more efficient for dirt removal. [but, that would presume this all wasn't filmed in advance...] still, this project rocks.
Madman!
Flipping awesome. You will make any respectable Mexican cartel proud with your tunnel digging skills 👌
You should probably put ventilation is if there is no air flow
ALERT: The FBI wants to know your location.
I was hoping for lots of the great escape hints and well Colin you don't  disapoint
Seeing why you originally installed the hydraulic pump is so cool
It's like building a huge pit latrine
Almost 1 million views in 1 day!!!!Wow!!!!!!
Lmao my mans going to start an earthquake
Love the hydraulic ram. Digging the side tunnel use hydraulic auger. Fast and silent. " Evil laughs."
How does one go about even getting planning permission for this
Colin: cant use that because its noisy. We need something else.  Proseeds to build something with noisy tools
Hopefully the neighbour doesn’t know follow you on YouTube hah
This time next year "Adding a basement to my backyard bunker" ;)
Colin my man! Be careful, that air blowing could be radon, the radioactive gas present underground!!
There is a lot of mines that looks like that
HES A MAD MAN
When all is finished, if love for collin to try selling his house just to see peoples reaction!
The length of the tunnel will be impressive at the end. I hope you can put cool stuff on the walls to add some style/decor and make it fun as hell to be inside. Just a few inches wider than a narrow walking only is hopefully something you thought about when planning. Love it.
Didn't he already have a hydraulic pump plumbed up for the shop?
Anyone else disappointed that he hasn’t started singing the “Secret Tunnel” song from Avatar?
Your pretty funny, and entertaining.
WOW Colin WOW.
I knew my cereal tasted funny this morning. The more ya know I guess 🌈👐
Did you have to apply for a building permit?
Normal ppl: Waiting for the next Episode of Loki  Me: Waiting for Colinfurze next upload
Colin he we are digging a “secret” tunnel also Colin post vid of how he’s doing it and where
FTBM incoming
next will be a tunnel to the underground beach hut
This man be living like rick from rick and morty
This is essentially Collins audition for the Sinaloa cartel....
Two lovers, forbidden from one another A war divides their people And a mountain divides them apart Built a path to be together Secret tunnel! Secret tunnel! Through the mountain! Secret, secret, secret, secret tunnel!  Two lovers, forbidden from one another A war divides their people And a mountain divides them apart Built a path to be together And die… Secret tunnel! Secret tunnel! Through the mountain! Secret, secret, secret, secret tunnel!
when you first watch this guy he seems to be mildly insane but he's just creative in his videos
Absolutely awesome…..I so cannot wait for Part 3! 😊
So when are you gonna add an entrance concealed by bricks and rubble and Saddam Hussein
He just doesn't want to apply for planning permission
"ColinFritzl: A story of a monster"
cant tell if property value is going up or down.
Cool 😎
Colin wants to hid his build from neighbors also Colin broadcasting to millions
Colin needs a sponsorship from the Boring company…..Elon?
I still wonder about the crack. I need more info about it.
aight im sayin it.  Colin Furze is one of the best youtubers ever made.
This is what I've always dreamed of doing as a kid!  I'm living vicariously through you, man!  Cheers!
Hey Colin what Did you do all lock down   Colin:Build a secret bunker
Hey an easy way to dig in this kind of dirt is a hammer drill coring bit with rebar nubs welded on and you don't even need the hammer function on the drill.
Who doesn't love a good hole!?
You remind me a popular Mexican drug lord
This guy is insane and we're here for it
Colin has become vietcong
Dude, never dig straight down.
Use a hydrologic  mole to make a guide tunnel. Use them under roads for running water lines .
I wish I could help!
i like i subb i want to see where the cave goes
I'm puzzled. If your plan is to dig the horizontal tunnel silently then why have you had to wait until the neighbours could leave? Digging an underground tunnel sounds to me like a perfect lockdown task. But I can imagine there are several practical reasons why I am wrong, I just don't know what those reasons are.
COLIN!!! That draft might be natural gas!! Be careful!
Ive never been this excited to see someone dig a big hole.
‘#minecraft’ lol
how did I just know there would be a reference to "The Great Escape" in this video...
A few words of advice.. Get an engineer / geologist to give a heads-up to digging in your area. Secondly if your deep enough the neighbours won't hear the breakers (like in a tunnel)..
Conngrats on what you’ve achieved so far.  What about an auger?  Manipulate it to work up, down, sideways.  May help take that pick out of your hand.  Quieter than a jackhammer.  Really enjoy your imagination.  Stay healthy and safe.
well done lad
Hard work bro my everyday
but where does the draft come from thoh i wanna see the cave you dug into
Can't you use the system of active noise canceling, but in a huge scale, everywhere microphones and big speakers that send the opposite sound waves into the room
Colin is THE definition of a madlad.
Colin watched you for years !!! You just get better mate !!!!!!! Amazing
Anyone else thinking of the song from Avatar, Secret Tunnel
Still not sure why you didn't buy a house in the countryside. Thought it would suit you much better!
I can't believe how fun it looks digging a hole, I wanna dig a hole from my home to my shed as well but I don't think the downstairs neighbours would approve of that
1. Pile the soil up 2. turn binoculars wrong way round 3. spoon soil into a jam jar Job done.
I get the feeling this will eventually turn into a complete underground city soon enough! Dig a mine shaft deeper!
I’m so curious what the permitting process for a project like this was like.
Surely at some stage the thought has run through your head. "Why the F did I start this".
are there any near kneighbours that could swap ?
Back in our days we used kids to do the work
He’s literally mining ⛏😂
You can use this opportunity to install geothermal heating. :)
I have never clicked on a video faster
Ever consider using an electric drill with a really large drill bit?
this is not a secret anymore...
Colin really needs to have an underground Bunker build off with Turbo Conquering Mega Eagle... he is another UK guy building a giant "secret" bunker in his back yard. I feel like his increase in videos on the topic has caused Colin to come back to this. I also feel like in the end Colin's isn't going to be as big or cool if it doesn't have it's own separate power and ventilation ect. here's a link to the current latest video on it but he uploads them every few days: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XvtcYL6t6g https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRv3Np2ihYxOKolEp_cyBYg/featured
Not so secret if a million people know about it 7 hours in, now is it?
🎶Secret, secret, secret, secret tunnel!🎶
He basically made his own trench shovel :)
Colin finds a big crack in the rock one week later Colin has a Batman type cave
Does UK have building permits? I know you own space above and below your property but no way it is legal to just start digging a tunnel, right?
this is crazy
Careful of that crack, if it goes too deep your have a workshop full of lava!
What happened to the crack in the wall?
"I have to be quiet so nobody would know about this" the puts up a video on his channel with 11 million subs
Planning officer is going to have kittens
How TF you get planning permission on that 😳
First rule of MC, dont dig straight down
I winced watching him use a jackhammer without hearing protection. Goddamn.
I got PTSD from my 5th grade band class
Me and my Viet Cong bois in Rising Storm 2 Vietnam belike:
Nice work
Collin, I aspire to be able to do things like this
Colin please do some great escape shinanagins
ins't very secret anymore
Imagine the conversation with his wife, "Colin what's your next project?" Well I'm going to dig a tunnel from the house to the underground bunker via the shed. OK the kids and I are going to stay at my Mums!
this dude is playing minecraft in real life.
I hope he gets his measurements right or he might come up underneath his neighbours house and come up through their kitchen floor tiles!  I’d love him as a neighbour, I’ll do the woodwork and he can do all the metalwork!
Colin, make a baby excavator arm! The use a beam with anchors on either end that you lock into the sides of the wall with a threaded rod system or something like that!
that looked like a ton of work from home , i cant imagine it in real life.. might have been easier to topple the shed , dig the vertical hole with a backhoe  , then rebuild the shed
Did you ask the escaping officer about this, it might interfere with one of the neighbors tunnels
Im more excited for this than season 8 of Game of Thrones.
fookin YAAAASSS!!
Long Live Furze. The oldest and best at this type of YT contentr.
Colin, you are a hero, but mate you want to stop right now. The limestone you are digging into where you are is famous for slipping mate. Also, I live on similar stone, the air and gaps in the strata you felt could lead to "fissures". No BS mate a guy got up one morning and his entire floor in his kitchen had fallen through, one fissure was used by the mines for nearly one hundred years and it could not be filled with spoil.  Pal, I have a bad feeling you will be getting some visits soon. If that stone shears you are a goner and that cage you built will not take that sort of force. Plus permeating gases from below could take you out. I have a feeling a local quarry to you will be supplying you with stone to backfill that. Hope I am wrong and you know better, but from what I have seen unless you start employing serious mining and tunnelling techniques and associated safety you will have to stop.
dont forget air circulation
Tom genuinely looks like tony soprano a suit on
Omg
Thum nail looked like the part of the mall map on black ops Cold War where u go down the latter in on the side of the elevator
John Constantine now digging holes XD THE BEST
I never thought I'd actively watch a video of someone digging a hole 😁
Collin - *USE POST HOLE DIGGERS*
Wouldnt a screw type cutting face be better for lowering the noise, then use the hydraulics to press forward motion as the rotating face cuts, like a mini drill tool like what was used for the Chunnel, then use the brace tool after each step forward as you get away from the back cafe.
I think he has been getting in trouble with noises lol
imagine being at home on lockdown for a year and not being able to work on this in your own home
Love it!
Without ventilation, it could be a death trap
lol he added the hashtag "Minecraft" to the video
So I just did emergency training for work… that bag Colin left at the pub - the one he ran from - yeah that’s gonna have to be treated as a bomb threat
Thought for a second there he went too deep and maybe the island of Britain had sprung a leak...😁
5939th.
Was expecting @colinfurze to build one of those mechanical playground diggers with the two control arms to help him dig 8D
I would think, since you're underground now, the sounds from machines wouldn't bother people
When you started to lower the mesh panels into the pit I thought that you are not only building a tunnel, but a Faraday cage too...lol  I hope that everyone will have a great day & be safe.   :)
Colin: doesn’t want to make a lot of noise  Also Colin: Blasts lots of loud music and does “band practice”
11...............thats a 13 ma boy!
Who else expected an over-engineered mining trolley on rails?
Amazing feat. Keep digging.
Serious props for doing that digging in a button up shirt and tie!
Pablo Escobar is watching this.
As mad as a box of frogs. Keep it up, Colin. :-)
Can you dig a secret tunnel to Area 51?
I love this project
No one talking about his next project? 5:17
Surely you can't just dig an underground tunnel in an urban space without running into gas, water, telephone, and power lines?
Me personally: This is awesome! Me as a building inspector/ the one whom gives permits to build: Wonder how the hell the goverment would feel about this? Haha totally split here! Great video as always! Fan from Sweden.
I really want to know where all the spoil is going/gone? Or has mount Furze mysteriously sprung up on the edge of the property?
I appreciate the #minecraft tag ☠️
Cool -though I feel that the background music from the film 'The great escape' would've been more apt.
Unreal respect for the rhino buckets after working with a CP drilling rig for a week. Those buckets get HEAVY
Makes a secret tunnel very quietly so that the neighbors don't find out...  Puts it on YouTube...
Absolutely awesome! Just one thing, may want to be aware of underground gasses found in cavaties in the ground. Might want to invest in a small GDU (gas detection unit) to save blowing yourself up or passing out due to heavy gasses coming down 🤘
I hope you are extra careful and don't get buried alive and the world would lose one of the most awesome people ever.
First rule of “mind craft” ….. never dig straight down. Second rule of “mind craft”…. We don’t talk about “mind craft “.
Colin was given a cheat code book to engineering by marty mcfly when he was a kid
We lived in Our last home for 28 Years.  My Father built a Music Room in the Bottom of Our Garden.  Our next door neighbour was a Master Builder.  Imagine Two Men Working Together for Ten Years.  Imagine the amount of Concrete which went into Our Foundations, under both Houses in that period.  Imagine the Trailer loads of Dirt which left Our respective Garages on a Weekly basis.  Imagine the Nuclear Shelters known only to Immediate Family, joined by a Tunnel.  Imagine the new owners of Our old house having absolutely no idea what’s beneath their Feet.
how is this guy not buff at shit
Collin I’m surprised that you didn’t build a conveyor system for the dirt, seems right up your alley
Never ever get rid of that outtro and it's music.
I hope we don't have to wait another 1.3 years to get another video.  That would be sad.
I would recommend adding some actual plate metal walls to keep any dirt/stones etc from falling through the grating due to vibrations or heavy rain.
There is no chance that this man did not go to Harvard
How do you have the energy, dedication and stamina ?
Limestone?  Nothing alot of acid can't SOLVE...
The only one that doesn't know that he's digging a hole is his wife
Colin have you been to the real secret bunker in Cheshire ??
Is he allowed to just dig straight down like that? Im not very familiar with what licenses and permissions one needs to build a tunnel but that mesh looks like it wouldnt be much help if anything collapsed.
I think im missing something. Did you mention why youre trying to be quiet? Out of all the times you built things in your back yard and you need to be quiet now? why now all of a sudden?
That shovel is awfully big, have you considered a thimble taped to a popsicle stick? Might be more appropriate
dunnu about exciting more like frightening !!!!
Colin man you are mental! Bloody love it!
Love the vids but don't hurt your back lifting all that dirt
I love this sort of videos the projects that take a wile
This man is an unintentional doomsday preper
I can hear you in the ground at this end in Australia.... Digging your way to another land 😉
Imagine a real estate agent's face when trying to sell this property
epic
Colin: DIGGING A SECRET TUNNEL  900000 ppl hmm yes "secret"
The person who will buy those cornflakes  XD
SHEAR AWESOME!
He must really love that house, he's never gonna move out of it. Especially with not only a bunker but a tunnel connecting all of them.
Nice work Colin, keep digging for that great escape I'm looking forward to the railway to remove the spoil😁
Chapo Guzman style
Imagine when he sells this house, the viewings will be nuts 😂
Colin: Need to dig quietly  Also Colin: let's build a piece that requires a lot of cutting and grinding and a pump to dig quietly
My word.
He's such a fun person.  But I kinda feel like if the music is from 60s hurts
He should put something to seal the door in the shed so when a nuke hits he can survive the blast before it blows everything
Drill motor and a planting auger
I thought you'd use a post hole borer to get through the dirt quicker
How much do you reckon the sponsor pays for a multi video series ? £100k?
I fear some kid is going to recreate this and die when the walls slide down.
Song recommendation for this project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytWz0qVvBZ0&ab_channel=YOGSCASTLewis%26Simon  With infinite loop.
That door frame needs fixing with expanding bolts.
You're the Johnny Rotten of engineers
If I were the neighbour's I'd be helping him 😁👍
Never dig straight down!!
Absolutely incredible.
Do you neighbors have internet? Maybe it is a bad idea to put something secret on youtube. :)
Mostly afraid of the buildings falling into the hole once you cross the angle of repose.. particularly with clay. Let’s hope the LPA don’t watch YouTube, an enforcement order might be embarrassing. I mean, I like a mad project, but not if it writes off your & your neighbour’s house. I doubt insurance would cover it..
5:39 What happend to your right arm colin?
I love the content, but I don’t like the lack of safety. I said it before when he built the underground beach house. Without wall supports this is incredibly dangerous. There don’t have to be warning signs that a wall could slide down. If it happens, that mesh isn’t going to help.
We need way more Tom
You are going to need a safety canary down there when things get deeper.
Hey Colin did a great job with this video
I tried this childhood dream once, but my pit kept filling with water. I had a kick-ass hidden trap door too.
I hope your keeping a total on the amount of tubs you fill, and run a competition in how many it takes 😉👍 happy digging
This is legit just 7 days to die irl
niceeeeee!!!
Where are you mans going
I live down the road from you
So did you consult like a civil engineer or company to make sure you didn't mess up the foundation of your house or have a tunnel collapse?
Colin im beginning to think you're the extra man that was involved with the Hatton garden jewellery heist !!! Where abouts did you hide your cut of the gem's 💎 💎  in the bunker i bet!!!
When i do visit scotland, i need to come and visit you colin whereever you live just so i can see for myself what it looks like
Nobody should thumbs down this video. I’m sure he spent a lot of time on building this
Why did the end of the video remind me of the film Silence of the Lambs?
Wait... so, has Colin been working on this since he installed the hydraulic pump & just kept everyone out of knowing about it by use of red herring videos? ... Well, I've said it before & I'll say it again. Colin, you crazy ingenious ba***rd.  Keep on rockin' on Colin. We're all excited to see what you do next. XD
The 500 dislikes must be your  neighbours from part one 🤣👍
aren't there drills to excavate that kind of thing? like the ones they use to drill ice for kilometers deep? surely you could've rigged something similar?
You deserve EVERY SINGLE 1 of those 11 million subscribers Colin. The best Channel on YouTube, by a long shot.
Quelle est le nom de la musique à partir 12:17 ?
this is epic
Thats the second great escape reference he has made, i love this channel.
You are nuts! Digging a big hole in your house. But I love it and want to do the same. Guess I'm nuts too.
"Digging a secret tunnel"   almost 1 milion views
Did he just say the middle of september?? how old is this recording
Why is Minecraft a # tag¿¿¿¿
Man this is intimidating, so awesome  and SOOOO EXCITING.
cool!!!👍👍👍😄👍👍👍 A secret tunnel only youtubers know about!!!!
So awesome how you take sick home upgrades as payment from sponsors.
Diamond core drills can be quiet. Drill chains of holes to lift out the rock.
This is the 17th tunnel Colin has started ☝️😌
I just watched someone dig a hole on the Internet.
You didn't mention ventilation... you are deep enough in to certanly have a plan for it before it becomes dangerous.  Especially when working with tools that could produce noxious or suffocating gasses.
More
6:08 lol
“I’m building a secret underground tunnel” *proceeds to post it on the internet* Keep up the good work Colin 😂
Dazu fällt mir bloß eines ein: secret tunnel! 🎶 Secret tunnel🎶...
Step 1: Remove floor  Step 2: Get trench gear
First thing that came to mind: "Dig a tunnel dig dig a tunnel..." - MxR Jeannie https://youtu.be/f_JFDnIohdo
Batcave? 😃
How you gonna sell that house?
But man, it's no longer secret now!!!
How the fuck you gonna sell that house?
Keep plugging away Colin, you will reach Australia in a year or two.
You could always make a hydraulic belt digger like a chainsaw from hell. Similar to dredge diggers.
So where did the breeze come from?
You know In video games, when you randomly find the house with a secret escape to some different location, this, this is the explanation why!
If you do use a vacuum to help remove all that dirt you can always put the vacuum cleaner in a soundproof box to keep the noise down oh also don't forget to add a discharge to the vacuum
Me: he needs to install a wench system to pull the buckets up…   The next shot of Colin making the wench: HE JUST READ MY MIND
Amazing! Does anyone know the Song at ~ 13:40 ?
In my country they dug my pool in a couple of days, maybe call a crew of those and be done with it? Awesome video Colin, thank you!
Builds a secret tunnel ..... 862.452 man's and women's know about :D
Do this in Australia and if you get caught, you'll be doing a 10 stretch ... Not that I don't like what you doing, reckon it's brilliant 👍
Hang on a minute, Colin didn't you secretary cut in footage from when you installed a hydraulic pump for your press in your workshop from 2 years ago. Is that how long this project has been going on for.
Colin I love your definition of secret when you put it up on YouTube.
Minecraft lied to me
Ok but seriously I'm thinking about spending money on youtube for the first time just to show how astonishingly genius that trumpet section was it totally made my day
This man be doing actual manual labor for this👍
I like how you included all the equipment in other video's to hide it in plain sight! Genius!
Hey If you going through a bunch of clay try sharpening your shovel
I made a hydraulic auger drill to dig my tunnels. it was pretty quiet. once we were down to depth we just closed the hatch to keep the noise down so no one heard a thing.
His secret tunnel is not so secret
Colin what are you doing. Why not start off with a with a really big vacuum.
When he says secret - he kept it secret for over 2 years
Ik the United States this would would be stupid cus people could take away your home but in the UK 🇬🇧 you goooood
I'm starting to feel like Colin is really a mad scientist villain... Too many dots are adding up.
Dude how does the local government not come down on you for permits and stuff. Or do you mean to tell me you get permits to dig tunnels lol.
I wish i could help you on 1 of your projects 1 day 😁😁😁  absolute ledgend 👌👌
secret tunnel but 1m people was seen it
A secret tunnel on YouTube for everyone to see
The Danish Invader been shedded in there a few times back in the 80’s!
I’ll check back in around part 100
Dude should have invented a mini mini digger before doing this!
That cave is interesting, I wonder where it goes. Also might be a good idea to put air testers up in the hole since you have no idea where the air is coming from. All it takes is one leaking gas pipe to make your whole tunnel and bunker a death trap if your not careful
Hey I wonder if a high powered vacuum would help you with removing all that dirt. I wonder if a vacuum can  help you dig a hole
I'm not doubting for a moment that he's not done the proper checks and that......but what's the laws/regs about Joe Public doing this? It's really cool and I can't wait to see the finish project, just curious really?
Strange piles of earth lmao
New chainsaw man anime looks great
thats my dream tool shed
Horizontal hydraulic auger it is then!
Secret? let's put it on youtube!
Puts in herculean effort to dig "secret" tunnel accidentally records its and over 800 thousand people see it.   Tragic
So you've uncovered one of the gates of Hell have you? ;)
You diging quiet like WW1 in the front .
Colin you absolute madladd
👍🏻 from Christchurch New Zealand bro 🇳🇿
did u ever find out were the air was coming from
Imagine  a collaboration with Stuff Made Here, lol
You madman! :D
HSE have a field day on this one!
Im sure it's been said but...... Seriously worried about noise with all that cutting and grinding that normally goes on???
nobody:  Colin probably in the 2030:building a miningshaft to the center of the earth
Band practice? 😂 You looked like mafia digging a hole to dispose of bodies!
*Vault-Tec Would Like To Know Your Location*
"secret"  makes youtube video
Lets all remember that a over million people watched this grown man dig a hole for 14 minutes.
Absolute madman, I love it!
the hydraulic post augers off a 1.5t digger would be ideal for the sideways dig, link it up to the ram for some horizontal pressure to drive it in and it'll just bring it all to you & into the buckets she goes.
So where was the draft coming from? Where did the crack lead?
How to escape east germany. Fun beside he talks about the struggle that people had to overcome. Were you let the Dirt? The diggingsound some tunnels were found because they werent deep enougth and the Stasiofficers could here them from above.
First rule in Minecraft: Never dig straight down!  Colin: pshhhh *digs straight down*
Possibly the most awesome project you’ve ever undertaken…. Can’t wait for the next instalment 👍
Please buy a wheel barrow
YOU NEED TO FIND OUT WHERE THAT CRACK GOES!!!!
6:08 That's what she said
"Free trade is a really simple and easy to use app"... if u live in Europe. So for those of u looking at the comments to see if downloading this app is worth a shot, if u live anywhere but the Europe, don't waist your time. You won't even be able to download it 😒😪.
Did this require planning permissions?
This is part 2? I come back in 2030 you crazy guy!
Did you need planing Permission to do all this?
Very nice!
Ahhh Colin, I never thought I'd see the day YOU sold out. Have fun in your collapsed tunnel, with corporate sponsorship....
Amazing project. There needs to be a safety disclosure.
imagine the confusion of a buyer if he sold his house
I love how he says “secret tunnel” and posts it on the internet for millions of people to watch.
I'm surprize he hasn't made a mini hydraulic bucket like you see from a mini excavator
Love that Colin feels the need to cover up the sound of digging as if his neighbors don't already assume he's just always up to no good XD
How is this allowed? Doesnt it damage the integrity of the land around it and neighbours property etc? really curious if he had to get 100s of permits/licenses
looking awesome , just be sure to get some ventilation in there ;)
Yes! Fantastic content Colin. Laughed my tits off at the idea of leaving a bag of dirt in the Café 😂😂👍🏼.  Such a great guy bursting with enthusiasm. You make me proud to be British. Stay motivated and keep up the good work mate 👏🏼 👏🏼
Dude! Insanely awesome!
Holy shite, massive project man! Great to watch
I'd love to see a planning, or how are we going to do this as I'm sure behind the scenes there are architects, planners, and perhaps the odd solicitor or lawyer on stand by.  Never the less I and no doubt others are well jealous.  Fantastic
What if you used a hydraulic screw like the ones that are used for drilling holes for fence posts but you attach a hydraulic ram to the end to drill sideways.
Are you neighbors not subscribed to your channel?
Inshallah !!
Minecraft irl
Where the fuck is the ground water?
Подскажите что за песня??
if only youtube had a love button ♥
Please tell them we want freetrade in Germany too
The number one rule of Minecraft is to never dig straight down. You have broken that rule, noob.
“Now our sponsors, wait a minute don’t skip this part “  Me - skipping the fuck out of it
You need a rotary hammer! Bosch, DeWalt, etc would be prefect for you.
Your Neighbours must love you!  But it's mental!!!!  Keep going
Like your videos although the music you play in the background is irritating as usual.
I do love watching tunnels being made. Not enough of this online ATM!  Thankyou Colin!     More episodes soon, please?       :)
What a fantastic guy, but would you want him as a neighbour? He'll yes
Wow just wow
Why doesent colin just use acustic foam to insolate the sound
There must not be any building codes in England
I wonder if it has to be secret cause his naighbours are arses
This is incredible. Although I bet the neighbours would've given anything during lockdown for you to have come round and asked them "wanna take turns digging a massive tunnel from my shed to my secret underground bunker?"
Can you meet: teh real live guys from Germany they do the seme stuff like you do
I dug a hole in the beach once, but I could only fit half my foot...
I never though digging a big hole would be such difficult, the mass volume and weight of dirt, rocks. Nice real life Minecraft.
Part 767 Colin is still digging :)
he really hit rock bottom, eh?
Crazy endeavour!
fantastic
"Your Capitol is at risk" Well, I don't own a Capitol, so... Can I use my capital instead?
Me on 2019: oh he is putting hydraulik system on his table to to more craisy stuff  Me now: oh he had planns for that
Just think about the men that did that during the war to escape prison camps. How they got ride of all the dirt is impressive.
Guys, do you somebody know in what project was this song with the verse about "spot welding"? It was a slower pace ska-punk or what...I heard it on the show but I couldn't find it ever since.
Im a pipe layer and this lack of shoring in the hole scares me. Please be safe!
Top tip use a fork to loosen it up then shovel out 👍👍
Damn. After Covid lockdowns I figured he would have had this built already
Best thing iv seen in a while really like your stuff bud
it aint so secret anymore if you think about it XD
I wish I could help
He definitely has never played minecraft
You inspire me, sir.  Lol.  So awesome.
He’s gonna add an elevator, mark my words
It's coming along great, but I really expected Colin to make a conveyor belt to carry out all of that dirt. I guess that's not as stealthy.
You absolute bloody mad lad. I love it
Footage of El chapos next escape
Having watched a lot of Time Team lately, I was expecting roman pottery to surface lmao
Pickaxes are good, but a breaker bar seems to be missing in Colins toolbox :)
I'm eager to see how you'll manage the roof of the tunnel and would love to know how you knew the top of the tunnel will hold itself
This guy is awesome i wish he did longer videos like 30 mins so you get to see more
I love this and I want more
Can' t wait for next video
its not a secret if u post it on youtube. dummy.
I’m from Denmark, and what the f is “ the danish invader”?
Secret underground bunker ? Weerner Zieegler, you heard of him ?
Honestly the part I love the most was seeing all the different lockdowns
how does the city like this :D
So this is when the video fir that pump was made to lol
Pretty excited for this - do you not need planning permission or anything for that? What's to stop you going through a water or gas main?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o4EI_-5reA
The music makes my ears bleed.
Is this movie @1:25 "The Great Escape"?
10 Years ago I build a timberframe shop at my house and resigned myself to the fact that I would never move... I can only imagine how bound I'd be to the property if I built a bunker and series of tunnels.
Awesome
Never dig straight down or you're gonna end up in lava and lose all your equipments
#minecraft lmao
You ever find any fossils in the limestone??
This is the coolest project EVER! Honestly so incredible. Who DOESN'T want a secret tunnel in their house!? Legend
Mr Furze! You need to build a TBM ofc!
When you said you can feel wind I thought you hit into the sewers
On today’s episode of Colin I’m going to build a illegal secret tunnel without anyone knowing about it
Are you still in the biscuit tin?
I'd put in side reinforcement to prevent cave in as you go deeper
the tunnel's probably built by now, but a mattock is great for digging. easier than pick and shovel until you get to solid rock. Tireing but looks like a fun project. Who has not imagined secret passages in their house?. :-)
Ok I know you’ve got the bunker… But hear me out, Collin makes a bat cave type of thing, had a whole underground mega bunker and can make that his new shop
this would be a lot easier in minecraft
Not so secret now is it?
In order to do this one thing, you made like 5other things (The winch ,wedge etc)
This is the best thing I have ever seen on YouTube.
Imagine he would do like a rail system through the tunnel
I'm surprised you didn't build a digging machine of some kind.
dig the music man lol
Be careful digging straight down you'll probably fall into a cave system by accident and into lava and lose your inventory. 😬
Are your neighbours really that bigs a douches that you can never make noise?
Thats some pretty nice dang welds.
Surprised that Colin didn't put together some sort of vertical conveyor to move dirt out of the hole -- articulated buckets on a chain powered by a topside motor, for example.
Bro, get Steve from MC to bring an efficiency 5 shovel and pickaxe
saddam hussein
Can you imagine living next to this mad lad? He would be both the best and worst neighbor ever.
Not so secret when almost a million people have seen this video
This is bonkers. I love it.
Anyone know what he does for a living/ where he learned how to make all this stuff? This how I wanna be when I have my own house.
Little did we know he was just trying to hide his drugs farm
Is this really a secret when over 800.000 people know about it?
I live 48 minutes away from you mind if I give you a hand? Haha
Il est vraiment fou cet anglais ! dans son puits il chantera "Goodbye Horses " de Q Lazzarus ...
Carpet in the shed. Could it be any more british!? :D
If Colin ever decides to sell up, I'll start the bidding at £1000000
I like that build itself. But I have little problem with calling it a secret tunnel. If you post your process on YouTube 😂
I was just waiting for your weight collapse the ground under you and watch you to fall into a huge cave.  Be careful and if you do fall into a big cave...  please can you post it or have your next of kin post it?  I can't think of a better way to go then doing something you love.
Everyone commenting on the hydraulic pump build 2 years ago actually secretly being for this... you're right, but think bigger. Remember when put a roof over the area between his workshop and his garage? IT WAS SO HE COULD SNEAK BUCKETS OF DIRT OUT TO THE CAR WITHOUT ANYONE NOTICING! This... goes so much deeper than we thought.
you kinda look like the weasly dad
You should contract Pablo Escobar's people.
OUR CAPITOL IS AT RISK!!
This man has every childhood and manhood dream contraption
During lockdown I started landscaping and levelling off the top tier of my sloped garden. 8 skips later….digging is real salt of the earth, back breaking labor. God speed!
Sweet video we cant wait to see the next. lol we are digging the great escape reference at 1:26. You Definitely  have us curious where that secret cave you found goes. let us all know more if you break open into the main cave, its got to be big if a draft is coming though so easily.
First it was bike then it was a bunker what’s next a space shuttle?
You should make a jet turbine conveyor tou take that million buckets outside 🤣🤣🤣
Very good
Why not use an auger?
Me see title of video: SECRET TUNNEL, SECRET TUNNEL! Through the mountains (not really)! Secret secret secret secret tunnel!
I would care 0% about the noise if I was his Neighbor.. id be over there with beers supervising the dig.
Make an elevator down
Next stop is Colin Furze station, please mind the gap! :-) #Tube
😂😂😂 Colin’s just made his way into Stamford’s main sewer system 😂😂😂
00:00 I don’t think he know what secret mean
Secret tunnneeelll. Secret tunnelll
wait, so what was the deal with the space in your cavern?? i’m still intrigued as to where it went or what it was a part of
you could’ve used an archimedes screw for the digging to not have to be in the hole constantly
It looks like a mine shaft thats gonna have an elivator in it
youtube is stupid. i dont get any notifications even i have it set to all... #sadge luck i found this video anyway. <3
Outstanding!!!!! Can't wait for the next video.
Where’s El Chapo?!?😂
Love the videos you create your way of thinking is good.
Last year I dug a 80cm, 30cm wide groove for electric cabling in my garden for just 15 meters. No stone, just solid clay. But even that caused me some blood, sweat and tears and took me about 2 weeks working mostly for a few hours in the evenings. Can't even imagine the insane amount of work you put into this project. Love It!
"Now this is getting exciting" well what has it been until now a bloody bready jambery!?
I can’t help thinking that I’d trust Freetrade as a financial institution more if they knew that capitol is not how you spell capital as in “your capital is at risk”.  Your capitol is at risk is what happened when the Proud Boys tried to subvert democracy.
i skipped
Fred Dibnah would be proud. :-)
He is the only person who is trying to bring the Rambo Last Blood tunnels to life
Please include more of the draft. I need to know where it leads!
Next episode “DRUG RUNNING ACROSS THE BORDER part 1”
Later In BBC :  A YouTuber caused a Large sinkhole that swallowed his entire Neighborhood.
Colin why did you not make a conveyer belt to take all that dirt away !!!!! that would have been epic
Does he need planning permission to do this ???
surprised you didnt make some grind of massive dirt vacuum that would take away everything you shuffle into it
Imagine being the person who purchases this house someday.
Colin Furze has officially reached the "man using stick to dig by himself" phase in his Youtube career
apparently He will get this finished before the Thames rail link and on budget..fancy that....
3:00 or just buy a roughneck mini shovel for like £12 from screw fix
Why don't you build a tunnel boring machine ?
What are you doing step bro ? 03:22
I hope he finds a massive cave
All I can think of is ATLA, SECRET TUNNEL!!! SECRET TUNNEL!!!
What's the soundtrack at 12:17?? Please help me out!!!!
The thumbnail is literally the end result of this video. I'll be back when the thumbnail shows it's done ✅
So what's next !!!!! building a secret meth lab ??????
This is so cool Colin, if I had enough money this is just the sort of thing I would do myself. Can't wait for the next video xx
El chapo or whatever that Mexican druglords name was.
"secret tunnel", proceeds to tell 11 million people.
All of a sudden he cares about the neighbors. Someone is maturing.
Last movie I watched that had Englishmen digging a deep hole in the ground did not end well lol ... Dragons were disturbed 🤦
I bet his neighbours are wondering why the shed is so quiet all of a sudden...
All that digging makes me want ice cream
ive never seen anyone be as psyched as colin about digging holes
Collin your videos always have the best music
This is fecking brilliant 😂
I can see the headline now, Popular youtube engineer Colinfurse dies in a tunnel collapse. Please be careful my guy.
Ill feel bad for the person who tries to break into Colinfurze house. The amount of suffering the person would have to go through.
Do you guys have planning and zoning laws? Because I feel like my local board wouldn't approve. 😂
Me spade.
It sure is the perfect furze project!  It’s extremely difficult and unreasonable but would be so cool to complete it…and that’s just what he’ll do!
"Not gonna explain much"  You explained it perfectly 😂
This is really cool but  #HowToMakeYourPropertyUnmortgageable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85vYBoiLpuE    A bit of music you should be playing while you dig
Wow, the new Minecraft Cave update is so realistic.
This man is doing what every single 12 yo boy has dreamt of doing....i know i certainly had plans of making an underground bunker space
You could try the digging method used by British engineers to blow up an enemy trench in WW1.
Hey Colin, why not make an electric motor auger to bore into the dirt??
You’ve a young back, but the wear and tear of this sort of work will make itself felt down the road a few years. Oh, and also… you are HILARIOUS! 😎 And not lazy.
I hope if we all go extinct, this is what stays to remind future species who we were.
Real engineering: I want to build something; In order to build it I need to build a tool for the job; In order to build the tool I need to build a thingy; In order to build the thingy I gotta build a thingamagiggy....  ......
I find it extraordinary that I can sit and watch someone dig a hole for 15 mins and enjoy it…
Speaking as a mining engineer, I would recommend a ventilation system to blow fresh air to the working face. Otherwise, more power to your elbow :-)
Colin furze looking like English John wick digging up his guns   Just in this case it’s his hidden beer barrels
A friend of mine from high school killed himself yesterday. Thanks for getting my mind off it. To the other viewers, if you're thinking of ending it please don't. You are loved (if by nobody else, then by me).
Oh Colin....how long would it take to make a tunnel from my shed near Boston to your man cave? I feel like there needs to be a secret underground network for sheds.
Man, I thought you'd design a cool hydraulic digger to remove all that dirt!
This is honestly amazing Colin. Truly inspirational.
Never played minecraft?  Never dig straight down!
If you were my neighbor and you apologized to me about the noise from digging your secret tunnel, I'd ask if I can help. I wish we were neighbors, that'd be stupid fun!
Minecraft
Very excited to see the next upload! I've been wanting to tunnel for years but always held back due to the fear of a cave-in.   I'll definitely be taking notes on your progress 👍
Do you have to get permits to do this type of stuff?
I know about digging holes. This is the shovel you need. https://youtu.be/nzhzG1AUYIQ
Being from Indiana in the US, it is amazing to me how high your bedrock is!! We have clay really deep here
This has turned into a 20-year prison break saga.
Real nice surprise to who ever buys that cereal box full of dirt....
2:17 strange piles of earth appearing in Stamford
Please please try to look into the crack with endoscope camera.
Colin: Now to tackle the final frontier Everyone: What, space? Colin: Yeah that too someday, but for now limestone
just curious but are your kids home when you make all this noise lol
instead of hydraulic pushing you should go for a hydraulic dirt auger slowly spinning
Genius with gigantic balls. Yes, I think this is the definition that suits you the most.
What an insane project, something we could only dream of. I love it!
Crazy Colin Furze build well why didn't you say so ....
Either hes the nicest man or he has the worst neighbours.. 🤷‍♂️
Now we see the real reason we got the hydraulic system video...
So the crack leads to the Colincave?
Greatest channel on YouTube
Once again, an amazing video, very creative and inspiring ! Cool editing btw
That crack is scary stuff
Imagine subsiding your own house
bring in el chapos crew col xD
I've found a crack with air coming through it.. it must be connected to the outside or maybe a cave.. I was expecting.. gas main... or sewer...
Why don’t you use a wheelbarrow
You lost me with the band practice
I hope you have a system to know the way of digging or you'll probably end at your neighbours house!
Shoulda just got a wheelbarrow
England beat Germany.....at football,  and Colin is digging a tunnel, he started in 2018, master planning Wing Commander Furze .Lol. Mad and brilliant.
I WANT MORE
El chapo has joined the chat
This is the best colin
remember to get all your papers in date and don't speak english
SECRET TUNNELLLLL SECRET TUNNELLL THROUGH THE MOUNTAIN
Get a macalister breaker with a spade bit mate
He should've been sponsored by minecraft
Use to watch all your stuff until you started supporting the bullshit mask wearing by selling them! Middle finger to ya!
U cant show us a secret crack and then just never mention it again :(
In Germany we would say "Wo ist dafür bitteschön die Baugenehmigung?!"
NOISSE
Is this allowed to just do or did you have to get permits
Best YouTuber in the world 🤘💪💚
makes me wanna be an inventor and do my own psycho projects
Colin is rediscovering WW1 tunneling techniques.
Furze! my back hurts watching this!  Do you every have herniated disc issues?
Me: thinking he should build some crazy hole drilling contraption powered by hydraulics instead of digging by hand...   Colin: keep watching...
Secret tunnel! Secret tunnel! Through the mountain! Secret, secret, secret, secret tunnel! Yeah!
Colin is the human version of a Freebirds burrito 🌯
Imagine buying this house, oh yea I forgot it also comes with a bunker in the backyard and an underground tunnel from garage to house and shed but that’s nothing to worry about
So Tom, Dick and Harry got a great Grandson, Terry? Cool as.
Colin Furze Mining Solutions
This is by far my favorite video series yet
I some how knew there'd a great escape sock reference
It’s amazing how you overcome obstacles and build your way out of any problems you face. I’d have given up at the shovelling stage 🤣
imagine his kid asking the mom hey mom where dad mom oh he is still diggin in his little hole
Plot twist... Colin doesn't want his neighbours to hear him cause when he's out of milk... he's gonna tunnel though to their house & grab some... Speaking of tunnels. This comment was sponsored by TunnelWare, tunnelware is a free anti virus software.
So you've basically hidden a huge hole from us for the last year
Foarte frumos
this is scary and I like it
If this is secret will we get a visit from the men in black to zap us with there mind eraser so we forget we ever saw this?
Mad man! I love him! My kids thinks I am so boring 🤦🏻‍♂️😆
How come it is a SECRET tunnel if 11 milions people gonna see it?
Well it's not so secret anymore
Oh no, my capitol is at risk 😱
"Ladezone" does fit at last :D
Colin, have you been recycling old footage ? Did you not install the hydraulic pump ages ago ?
Cool I‘m looking forward the new videos.
Why not use some kind of screw, like big auger for diging ? It wud be quiet, yet still move soil better than just pressing it with hydrolics
Can we spare a moment to contemplate on how strong Collin must be? He's doing all the physical work in a shirt without ever looking exhausted
El Chap
Now, you can make a real man cave.
I hope you haven't found underground water. It would ruin the project.
A quiet Furze is a dangerous Furze
Every 'Big Kids' dream being realised right here! Crack on Colin and good luck 👍
I love the hiding dirt references!!!  Sound like neighbors can and do cause you grief over there
Nice going,Colin! This definitely looks like the best Firze project evea!!!!
Growing up my best friend and I were next door neighbors. When we were nine, during a few very memorable sleepovers, we devised a plan to connect our respective basements with a tunnel. I'm 100% sure we'd never seen The Great Escape at that point, but still the idea was to keep it as low as possible and stretch a rope through on which we would've pulled ourselves along in a little cart. Oddly similar to the movie.  We even thought we'd figured out how to achieve this without any adults noticing. Well, that never really took off, but it's good to see that it would have *theoretically* been possible.
Covers noise of digging, shares with 11 million people
I've always wondered how to properly dig something under ground with safety And there you are
So now we know what all those YouTube vids of "strange booms heard all over the world" are, it's just Colin digging a tunnel
bet it floods
I wanted to build something like that when I was 10.
So much yes! Looking forward to the next episode!
I can’t Front, this dude is fucking awesome
This is just amazing watching a man dig a hole
I think you'll probably find some red stone at that level.
I love this absolutely awesome 👏🏻 fair play to you Colin… i also like to offer my services if you ever want a hand 🤝
Чувак, мы верим в тебя!!! Ты сможешь!!!
11 million people know about it
Imagine it taking a year to dig a hole lmao
It not so secret
Hmmm he has been in the sheed for 2 days and its completly quiet... defenenly not sus!!
Noise and rubble aside.. I think neighbours will notice when they will dig hole for a pool and several cubic meters of soil will fall apart between the two properties.
Fred Dibnah got into trouble when he dug his mine shaft.
me skiping the bit
Is this legal?
The timing between this and all the saddam huissein tunnel memes is pretty funny not gonna lie.
I think the war is going to be over before you’re done Colin………
2:15.  Strange piles of earth appearing in Stamford.  🤣  Kicking it up to 11 as usual Mr. Furze.  Love it.  👍
How long did it take u too dig that
when Collins gets it better than Hamas 😂😂😂
Ну, Колян, ты даёшь!
Year ago this would have been a very popular video in Mexico
Colin, you are nuts in all the right ways! This channel has come some way since even before the first wall of death days, the dedication you put in has not lessened over the years either. You deserve all the millions of subs you've earned over these years and I'm glad to have followed from almost the start. Keep being your awesome self, you really are a one off! P.S. Sneakiness of the highest order - now we know the real reason for the barely perceivable additions in the shed over time and of course the hydraulic pump...
Me: Begins to skip the sponsor bit Also me: Sees Colin's head in a tin of biscuits Me again: Decides to rewind and watch the sponsor bit from the beginning of it Me for a fourth time: Satisfied.
This man is insane! I love it!
I like how he’s trying to be quiet after all the other mental stuff he’s done in his garden.
Man would have a lot to explain to a realtor if he ever decided to sell that house lmaooo
I wanna be able to just get this giddy over a hole in a ground like this guy
Am I the only one who keeps hearing secret tunnel from avatar the last air bender in my head during this project hahaha
Colin what is the name of the last Song called? Little bit Orchestra Sound like
man, your neighbours must hate you
5:51 "Your Capitol is at Risk" <-- a not-so subtle message to the Americans in Colin's audience? 😆  PS I am not intending to mock Colin for the spelling mistake, we all know what is meant, but this one changes the meaning quite amusingly!
Op
2:00 + 2:18 🤣😆🤪😁😁😎
Some people take minecraft too seriously XD
Colin get planning permission and building control involved, or at least get surveyors supervising. I see you haven't got anything showing on the planning portal.
Electric mini excavator would be nice for this project
Every kid's dream right here! Love it!
Interesting.  If I would to dig down in my back yard I would encounter ten meters of and followed by limestone bedrock, assuming that I didn't reach the water table first.
World War 3 starts: Me showing up at this man's house: :> please let me in
So you just have your own window at the permit office, eh?
I wonder how in the hell hes getting permits to do this
Awesome!
It took you so long to break through 3 dirt blocks
Minecraft makes this look so easy
Aye Colin remember to sharpen your shovel
TBF, thats Cools AF!!
Anyone else thinking el Chapo with these tunnels???
Background: heavy rock music Video: him digging a hole  in the stupidest way
How the hell do you get the planning permission for this?
Everybody talking about the project  Me : was he with a T shirt ?
okay, not skip, but mute
Pipelines?
I have two empty crunchie peanut butter jars here with a long-expired BBE date. I'll mail them to you, put some earth in and chuck them straight in the rubbish bin.
CAN YOU DIG IT!
I am surprised that it is that loud given the depth. But I know how loud things like jackhammers can be. This is so exciting, it makes me want to build my own tunnel! :D
This guy is living proof that it is acceptable to be bonkers if you are also a genius.
My childhood dreams basically...
THE FUNNIEST YOUTUBER IS HERE GIVE IT UP FOR COLIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
While everyone was busy digging in minecraft colin was busy making live adaptation
You are an absolute madman, and I love it.  What grown man hasn’t dreamt about doing what you’re actually doing!!
Going to new depths for those subscribers!
You're fucking insane! I love it!
SECRET TUNNEL SECRET TUNNEL   THROUGH THE MOUNTAINS   SECRET SECRET SECRET SECRET TUNNEL
Try using a demo hammer with a shovel bit to chop up the dirtt
@Colin Furze thank you for the share
Colin we’re gonna need you to explain this video and the hydraulic shop conversion video. You just confused us all.
to hide the dirt ya just dig a hole way out back and put the dirt in the hole!
you showing hydraulics "This will work" mexican drug cartells - "write that down, write that down "
In germany by doing this you go to jail
How do you manage to get council approval for all this under ground work. Safety etc.
I don't think its a secret anymore if its on youtube😂
That mild steel framing is going to rust immediately
That's awesome. Could you have used a hydraulic auger like what an excavator would use to drill pier holes?
First rule of Minecraft - Don't dig straight down.
nutter:)
I like how its a “secret tunnel” yet we all know its there
secret?
I get so excited every new video, I aspire to this!
Mint!
4:10 As a fellow fat man, I feel bad for Tom.  Too much clothing for that type of exercise!
Voilà ! Thanks from Europe ;)
Why does this vid have a minecraft tag?
Seems planning permission is a concept of the past :D
Makes me wonder if and how he got the town to allow this. Lol
free trade anybody using it
Making awesome things while being a good neighbor
as of now, only 734,649 people know of his secret tunnel.
*Hamas started following you*
hes really trying to do it sealthily lol
1:35 mmm
does sombody now what the name is of the track at the and of the video? it's not one of the tracks in the description
Meanwhile, in some MI5 secret underground facility: "let's get the hell outta here, furze is digging! "
You made the mistake of not using a Beacon with Haste 2, which would make you instantly mine. Also, you didn't enchant your pickaxe with Efficiency 5, so with those 2 things combined I think you would make it in no time.   Also, I recommend making a Floor Piston door that activates with a secret button or a combination of a few buttons, that way even if people snoop around, they won't be lucky to get in. Cheers.
and then it goes like SECRET TUNNEL, SECRET TUNNEL
This video is so cool that I watch it 2 time can’t wait for part 3
Electric Jack Hammer... Spade bit
This man really tagged the video with #minecraft
You should have hired 3 Mexican and they would have done the job in 2 days lol
You've awoken some primal instinct that makes me also want to dig my own hole. I don't know why because I don't need one.
Just put efficiency 5 on your pickaxe and shovel, it will be much faster.
Howd you get planing permission for this. (I assume you didnt tbh)
Wondering why Colin didn't use an auger to dig the dirt out
This is like a prison break finish around xmas 2050
Lol i love how he is so considering of his neighbors i wouldnt care xD
Can’t wait for the final product
I need to come hide with you for the apocalypse😀👍
wow that still looks waaaay faster than what elon musk is doing to dig tunnels.
Needs to speak to El Chapo!
All the intruders know it's there now... lol
If you were to go a little deeper, im sure the sounds would be lessened so you could use bigger tools
Colin... your council must have a field day when you come in asking for planning permission.
♪ SECRET TUNNEL! ♪ ♪ SECRET TUNNEL! ♪ ♪ THROUGH THE MOUNTAIN! ♪ ♪ SECRET, SECRET, SECRET, SECRET TUNNEL!!! YEAH! ♪
Your neighbors are already watching you ;)
And here come the Saddam Hussein memes..
Don't forget, this is a SECRET tunnel
Old Colin is on a vault line, in Stamford hahahaha
How about a power post hole auger? You could convert it to hydraulic power..
Next build: a giant underground vault to store things.
Tell tom mr Charles is the handsome one!
British man haunted by ghost of BEF ancestor
How did ya hide the planning permission from next door lol
Little surprised there is no bucket wheel. Electric motor to a conveyor belt
after this is done he is gonna be ripped as hell lol
That is class
Middle od september. ? Nice latency
Hi Colin thanks for making this video, it is amazing to think how long it takes to make these videos. Have a good day everyone
This is sick
I was just humming the titel of "the great escpae" when you showed the cutout of the great escape xD what a coincidence
MineColin! FurzeCraft!
Flytipping at it best
Colin, in case you weren't aware, be careful welding in a confined space. Gases can over take you before you know it. Lost a few friends that way.
starting to look like the entrance to a batcave
Got to dig a tunnel. Quick before the hyena comes
Epic!   I wonder if you’ve soundproofed the hatch so you can continue to work in silence. I’d bet the depth you are at now would block out most noise from your tools.
Building a conveyor system will go a long way !
I am getting exhausted watching this and I just wanted to relax and watch something funny.
BREAKING: Local Man Builds Secret Reverse Skyscraper Underneath House for Fun, Neighbors Completely Oblivious  Seriously though, this is actually the DREAM.
I don’t think you could ever sell that house and move after all the work you’ve done to it, and a new owner would be in for a complete shock finding the tunnel one day 🤣👍🏻😎
The Furze!!!!!
Guess none of the neighbors have YouTube
Hell, I dug about 25 holes to install posts for a privacy fence, and it was the absolute worst. Surely you're not digging all that with a shovel.
My niebours complain if I floss my teeth too enthusiastically. Big up to your niebours for putting up with your shenanigans 😜
Can’t imagine what would happen if you gave him a boatload of mushrooms.
I bet ur neighbours love you
Don't forget to add ventilation.
Be careful with the amount of oxygen down there if you decide to bring a motor down. Carbon Dioxide is heavier than air.
I think its a good thing your found that void in the earth, that could possibly lead to a sink hole under your place
Who else thinks this man lost his sanity long ago?  He's very smart but hes 100% nuts (honestly that maybe the reason y I keep coming back to watch him)
How is this legal haha 🤣
The amount of dedication to dig that deep and transfer all that soil.. I'd quit after 1ft.
so you built a slow speed long through jackhammer.
I hope ur living in this house a long time cause moving will be so hard
So to build a quiet machine he uses all the loudest tools in the workshop good job On being discreet Colin
"I don't want anyone to know about my tunnel"  *posts it on YouTube for millions of people to see*
Holy shit the great escape reference god thats one of my favorite movies
I wish I had an ounce of Colins engineering talent, a masterclass of multiple skill sets
His wife must be going crazy with all  his ideas he is  legend
How you get planning permission for a secret tunnel... Because if you're without permission the council will find new and inventive ways to make your life shit. Including condemning the property and demanding you fill in everything.
Yes mate...just what i'd love to do!!..I bet everyone here thinks the same...fuck yeah!! 🤘
next video creeper noises
dude put a tray under your hydraulic pump you will eventually get a leak because it is hydraulics & they always leak.
This reminds me of the tunnels in Rambo last blood
Colin, you should build an auger system to excavate the tunnel like your screw tank.
After all these years, and you're still the best channel on the whole site. Fuck yeah!
What happened with the crack!
Oi, that's a proper project, mate!
He has the energy of 10 men!
"This is a secret project" Collin: shearing it with 11 million viewers
He's becoming an american so fast!
Silence of the lamb mode activated!
Can't wait for the next video ...been a while that I've watched your videos ...hope your nabours ain't upset or anything ...and that crypto thing isn't out in my country 🥴🙃
Colin is just a few feet away from finding Sadam Hussein
When are you doing part 3
Ich würde so eine Art Eis Bohrer benutzen müsste klappen. ❗👍👍
Your sponsor is a pyramid scheme... Nice tunnel tho, very pog.
I love you so much for doing the work yourself. Unlike the legions of tools getting paid to do reality tv-esque, socalled "reaction" videos, you, Sir Colin, deserve a hefty paycheck, as well as a heaping helping of well-earned admiration. Keep rocking, brother. 🤘🏽💜✌🏽
Is it me or is this CRAZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZY
THATS SICK BRUUUH
The secret tunnel that 11 Million people know about lol
Shovel cam is back <3
If you come out in a rice paddy field- stop digging.
So you built a hydraulic system to do what a digging bar does, okay
HOLY CRAP, you installed your workshop hydraulic system so you could dig, not for the reason you said in that video (which was TWO YEARS ago). Just nuts. So much time working on this.
You could make up a quick tool similar to how a plaster board screw works use your hydraulics to push it in then twist and it will spead out like a spade whilst lifting it out at the same time, 😎
Damn it, i wanna see more ...like right now
Nice Mate!
👍👍
Loved that "Lockdown" transition!
Incredible trombone skills.
Can we just appreciate how much effort he puts into every video he makes
How does this guy not look like Larry the Lobster     Man’s doing digs every other month for hours without break
you could sort by size and sell bags of sand and gravel on Ebay, that can't be as problematic as dropping bags under your table at every restaurant in town.
More please
Hey, were gonna do a secret tunnel! *Posts every detail on youtube*
Tunnel boring machine here we come!
So any plans on building a tunnel boring machine? 🤣 Nice job keep on digging.
totally forgotten bout Colin, and quite sad i did cuse this is sick
Next video: I put dirt in random places until i get in trouble
Wow this was filmed quite a while ago from March 2020 to April 2021 and he released it today in July 2021??
I wish part 3 was out
This is going to be the best series of all time
mate you are fukin amazing. An inspiration for me !!
Can’t wait I would love to see it now please. Keep up the great work
You should look into using a slow speed concrete drill. Would save you lots of time digging and is no louder than a circular saw.
Lol anyone see the hashtags for the video 😂
why not build a small tunneling machine ?
Oh, I like digging on Minecraft. Colin:  😂
Not very secret if it’s had nearly 90K views 🤦🏼‍♂️🤣😂🤣😂🤣👍
Imagine how awesome it would be to be friends with Colin it would be amazing
This will be the best content on Youtube!
🤯🙌🏻
Can't wait for the elevator like in star trek.
This man has an entire machine shop in his backyard and he’s afraid of making to much noise tf
If only he could invent a bucket on wheels, a barrow of sorts with a wheel. uhmmmm
Make an elevator instead of a ladder!
plot loss
You need an auger!
How do you even get a permit to do this😂
how loud could tunneling in a deep as hole in your garage possibly be for you neighbors lol.
Should always trust someone who vacuums their hair 😉
I love that project and it's side projects!
Look, I’m a mining engineer, you’re completely of your trolley, and I love it 😂  I started a shaft 20 years ago but her who must be obeyed put an end to it 🙄
If we were a year back I’d call this quarantine preparations
I like to believe Colin just got some noise complaints and now he can’t work on anything loud until his neighbors move out
Now what you need Mr Furze is a hydraulic auger bit so you car drill into the dirt and pull it out, but im guessing you have already dug out the tunnel by now !!!?.
NEEJJJ - hvordan kunne du gøre det mod "the Danish Invader"??
Me years ago, wanting to have all the cool tools that colin furze has.  Me now: Working at a shop with all those same tools. You have truly been a inspiration for me and all the stupid shit i have built. So thank you very much!
That's not really a digging tie tho, is it.
I can only begin to imagine the planning permissions needed for this.
How do I get my free share when doing the investing, I’ve already started investing using the link in the description, it really is as easy as Colin says it is, I just haven’t received my free share as of this point
I don't know how all that shit works in the UK but.. if you'd try to do something like this in the Netherlands I think you'll be arrested and get a big fine or whatever. Like huge.. and you'd have to fix it to it's original state I guess. For as far as that would be possible.
ingenious in leaving the piles of dirt everywhere
When it's night and you don't want to find a cave for iron
Imagine when/if Colin sells his house one day and, just for fun, he doesn't tell the buyer all the "extra things" that exists in, on and below the property. The new owner is gonna get a helluva surprise. Can't imagine what he would sell it for tho. Whatever the price, it would be worth it!
You need to build a powered wheel barrow for this project
SECRET TUNNEL, THROUGH THE GARDEN
When Your Mine Is In Your Minecraft House:
imagine starting to dig a masive hole in your shed and then stop coz you got bored of it. that would be me
I want to listen a "Still Alive" From Portal Cover made by you, man.
Is this british dale?
Colin, Could you soundproof the hatch and use a pick down there. Obviously you might need to set up a fan for fresh air and wear respiration gear. But it would be faster if you could use a pick. Try set up a sound recorder or meter outside, Close the sound proofed hatch and measure how loud it is. You might find that near to no sound will escape that deep under the shed.
Sorry i skipe
music inspiration : BATMAN !!!! Love it so much !
You just know that this series is gonna end with a news clip from China about a man from the UK appearing out of the hole left by a massive explosion in the middle of some road in Beijing.
How will the neighbours hear you and why does it matter anyway? They must know who you are by now. You could just fill your shed with insulating foam to cancel the noise, much of which would be diffused by the tunnel itself at this point.
In germany we say no building permit 🤣🤣🤣
I absolutely love the music you play in your videos
it already have an post-apocalytic  looks, just already at this stage , it looks so cool
So next then is the Furze tunnel boring machine. See if Elon Musk will sponsor ya with a little one from The Boring Company. lol
God damn it colin
great escape  love it ! XD
stupid neighbors.
This is the first British guy which ur brain will resist to roast
i can’t wait🤯👏👏👏
Colin just for the sake of yourself in the late future you really really should be wearing some sort of ear protection when you're working in such enclosed places with such loud equipment, I look forward to watching future videos man just wanna be able to hear you!
Next episode, finishing construction of the nazi tunnels
Who else didn’t want this video to end
This is the most amazing project you've ever done Colin. thumbs up, cannot wait for the next video Paul in Lincoln
Give your chums at Freetrade a nudge and tell them to send me my free share please. Ta.
This video is so silent, I had to turn up my volume to 11!
does you're kids even know about this
Hey Colin, here a small idea for build sideways, perhaps drill holes like this guy, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJcelsBQfVk .
Hopefully your neighbors dont watch your videos....
good stuff
aww the app isnt avaible in america
Can't wait to see the next one 👍 👍 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
I’ve ordered a new bed, it’s being delivered tomorrow and I’m dreading putting it together. Then I watch this video … I think a flat pack bed will not be a problem 😂
I want to know where the draft was coming from? :O
Did the "wind" smell like sewer?
So this is the secret reason you tidied up your shed. Lesson learned: Furze always has a secret, awesome, reason for doing everything. To think I was actually worried you were gonna start moving on from YouTube.
This guy never disappoints
Is this legal? What about power and water lines, anything else? We used to build underground bunkers when we were kids, basically a trench with a roof until a bloke came with his car and fell inside, luckily we weren’t there. This is an awesome project by the way, really exciting love it, where’s part 3?
This is highly illegal
I’ve never seen a louder person work so hard to be quiet 😄
Minecraft 🤣🤣
Didn’t realise this nutter lived just down the road in Stamford ffs 😀
Aren't you worried when theres alot of heavy rain for several days that the rain/groundwater might enter the Tunnel through the walls somehow? I'm not an expert in that field, just thinking that dirt/limestone might not hold off everything. You should definately consider something to prevent flooding or to get the water out if there is flooding.
One of the #s is Minecraft lmao
go Furze go!
The hand in each video is like when you got the toy in the cereal box.
Nice! Dig deeper to water and make water storage
How did he get the whole money for all that stuff ?
0:35 Colin is just playing irl minecraft
How do neighbors react to your builds
Great video and project!  I was just curious what the process was like to get permits for that there...  Here it would take years lol.
Cool dude
I'd like to see colin make a miniature boring machine..
You are crazy. Also, how do you dig straight? Have you set up corner guides with laser pointers, or something like that?
Noticed your mates are missing when the manual labor digging needs done!
5:16 Spoiler??
i knew that my Kellogs are a little weird.
It isn't that secret if you make a video about it and post it on youtube...
I’m SOO EXCITED!!!!
So Colin, for what are you Preparing youself?  You know something we don't know, right?   (was my first thought) :D great great!
SO PRIMITIVE TECHNOLOGY, MAKES A HOUSE IN THE UNDERGROUND IT'S FAKE
😃👌👌👍🇺🇿🇺🇿🇺🇿🇺🇿🇺🇿🇺🇿🇺🇿🇺🇿
“Now this video is sponsored but DO NOT SKIP THIS BIT”  no
Little sus leaving a bag in a coffee shop and then running away :DDD
When he said 'its now september' I realised this is really really massive
I wonder if one day an archaeologist will find this tunnel and wonder why the owner had a massive tunnel and bunker beneath his house lol
Did he record these sponsors years ahead of time? Or did he just jump back in the hole
Imagine the stories in 150 years when someone finds this 😂😂there going to think alsorts of stuff ahaha, mad how your going to have this under your  workshop
Cant you just isolate the hatch and close it when your working down there so your neighbours cant here you
Sick
Do you need planning permission for projects like this?
Why are you trying to hide it that much, to skip an entire year XD
Thats a huge task, some serious graft moving all that soil 👏👏👏
You have to see if that crack goes down maybe to a big cave system!
Easily the coolest thing you’ve ever done!!
The fact that you have been doing this since September 2019, but then had to put the project on hold for 1 year and 3 months, and then have the motivation to continue with it just makes you more admirable. Keep up the great work.
In case of the apocalypse Colin is ready
The like to dislike ratio is INSANE great video man
digs in the wrong direction and finds out when he pops up in the neigbors house or shed
"OK I must be quiet so the neighbours  don't figure out what I'm doing..."  Gets 10 foot down and falls into a tunnel his neighbours secretly digging under his garden.  "Oh hi Colin.....well this is awkward...."
You are crazy, that is a amazing proyect
Waitrose shopper, very fancy
someone is gonna think that cereal is a bomb lmao.
Why not a big hydraulic auger that also moves the dirt up an onto a small chute that dumps into bucket?  After that it's just a matter of cleaning up the corner.  :P  Also, this is amazing.
Yo
This is the only video series as exciting (if not more so) as the bunker series!
Seeing Colin filling the buckets - made me think of the Great Furze scape - Then a clip comes on the screen..   Great minds and all that
Giving me ideas 💡 - Make a bunker under my house, sell the house and live in the bunker like some criminal mastermind!
Not that secret if millions of people know about it
It be weird if two people where in the shed with loud music because you wouldn't be able to talk to each other. Thats how you know colin never been to a party where theres drinking
I cant believe he didnt use a wheelbarrel for that amount of earth to be moved out of the room lmao
Van Colin be my Neighbour?
I can not wait till the next video on this project. So cool. You are amazing with everything you do. Such a wide variety of stuff you know how to build ECT. Very cool.
Should've called them boys from the jungle hand dig videos. Lol
I love the little noises that colin makes when he's exited
My father dig a hole deeper than that in just one day😎
Imagine if he was your dad
Being from England, that must have been a pain to get through planning permission
Colin you have gone so sensible and considerate. I'm not sure I like it.
I love that the #minecraft tag was added to this vid!
This is how it all starts!   Has the English secret tunnel society contacted you yet ?
What a great neighbor
i love it
I love thsi
Won't this damage the water proofing of the bunker
This is such a crazy effort you put into this, Colin! Great video, just great!!
Colin you're a mad lad, and I love everything you do!
Colin's head in a biscuit tin was worth staying for the advert
I was today years old when I discovered that a spade and a shovel are not the same thing.
U should use fireworks to blow the dirt loose
Ok...this is madness! The bunker project was already way beyond. But this one is just unbelievable! Keep digging! :)
Did you block the fan on the hydraulic power unit?
SECRET TUNNEL! SECRET TUNNEL! THROUGH THE MOUNTAIN IN THE SECRET SECRET SECRET TUNNEL!
Is this guy playing modded minecrafy in real life or what?
Love the great escape reference :D
You are my hero for this
That funky british punky junk is sick
at this point after a decade Colin would've made a tunnel to china
Nothing like a load of clay dirt to slow you down:( Had to deal with that type of soil building swimming pools.
who got balls to build something like that under his house thats Colinfurze
It’s what I call “cool like in the rule”
how is no one talking about the fucking !!BOX OF DIRT!! he left in the store!! ROFL
I love how he used the hashtag minecraft
Too much minecraft
What on Earth does a COVID lockdown have to do with your ability to work on digging a hole inside your shed, Colin?
Secret, secret, secret, secret tunnel!
I don't know if you already got rid of all the soil but some of it was looking rather clay like it could have been processed by hand into proper homemade clay.
this guy 🤣🤣
Awesome
I'm digging this project!
Yes part two!
Can't believe this man waited 3 months to put up this video what a legend
У вас кроты наверно с твердосплавными когтями))
im suprised you didnt strenghten the tunnel at like 1 meter depth, you never know when a hole can cave in! more safety next time!
Secret.... 1 million people watch this
The horizontal digging will be much more dangerous. You must build framework as you go I am sure. I can't wait to see it!
It looks like the inside of a ground type pokemon gym
imagine someone buying the house in 30 years time 😂
sound proof your shed and close the tunnel lid when down there to blanket the noise?  also get yourself a canary incase of gas :D
Literally use whatever you want and put the lid down... I don't think it'd be that loud with you down there 😅
Who ever owns this house after Colin, is in for one hell of a surprise
Watching Colin struggle with getting the stuff out the deep hole I was thinking, "I bet he's about to decide to build a small crane".  Was not disappointed.
With his is skill he might as well make a replica of the world
6:08 thats what she said ;)
the great escape
Очень крутой чувак!не мешаешь ни кому!давай 3 часть!
Nice reference to The Great Escape.
Try building some sorta hydraulic auger for digging perhaps?
So he started this before
Silly Question but when your digging Vertical why not use a Powered Auger like you would use if you are putting posts in for a wooden fence? You could do that until you hit solid rock and seems like would be faster and less work with the shovel and pick.
Your consideration for your neighbours is admirable
I wonder why excavation is never done using a suction system, like dredging in the ocean. Sure, it won't handle the stones and big clumps of wet clay, but surely it's worth the setup effort once it's running and the majority of the loose material simply gets pumped out into the yard where it can be disposed of?
front drive rear steering bike
You have way more energy than an adult male should have.
You are fucking crazy 😂 i love youre Projekts!
Whoever he sells this house to is gonna have a fun time finding all of this stuff
Mans is doubling his property value
Quite fitting that hitachi should make a jackhammer
I absolutely LOVE the Great Escape reference. Been thinking about this whole project through that lens since the first video last week.
Dude, everyone on YouTube know about your secret.
That "crack" he found looks like it might actually be part of a small cave or something they way it kept getting bigger like that. How cool would that be for him to find a massive cave under his house? He could literally have his own batcave under his home just like batman. Lmao.
You must have the best house around with all the additions you have made your a genius Colin this is so cool
I will make a secret tunnel , and tell the world about it :D:D but i love the idea
That is exciting!!!
Your house and land you own will be worth millions now having a bunker and a whole tunnel lol
Oi mate, you got a loicence for that 'ole there?
He should build a mini tunnel boring machine
But where did the crack lead!!??!!
Cool, you need to build a T.B.M. Colin!
I'm a little disappointed Colin didn't build a tunnel boring machine.
Is Herrenknecht the sponsor of the next video?
Great project, when I saw you lift up the heavy bucket with soil I thought, Colin needs a winch, next frame Colin installing a winch 😂
I hate wen your video ends
I love all the references (and the clips) to The Great Escape!
What happened to the crack you found with the air blowing?
Does the council know that you're doing this?
Not that secret now its got over half a million views
Why not a big hydraulic auger that also moves the dirt up an onto a small chute that dumps into bucket?  After that it's just a matter of cleaning up the corner.  :P
I wanna dig tunnels now
I am glad you didn’t forget to put some Great Escape references in there! Good job Sir!
colin furze: Lets dig a SECRET tunnel the 615.000 viewers: uhh...
DEDICATION! Love it Furze <3
Hey Colin. Just remember that at this point of the "build", uve made a co2 trap. Please be safe and get som oxygen down in the tunnel pit thingy :-)
This house is gonna be worth £5m by the time he's finished!
colin cave colin cave
Hope that breeze isn’t coming along the sewer line...
My capitol is at risk?!  Not again!
Can we all just take a minute and appreciate that Colin this all by hand? That is no easy task.
Colin gonna be so ripped when this is done, no gym needed hah
this is awesome, I always wanted to build a secret underground tunnel
What if your neighbours see this video?
I love your videos!
Dude, wear some ear pro. 30db plugs aren't gonna cut it. No wonder you yell all the time ;D
"You capitol is at risk" excuse me Freetrade?! Plz don't invade
I’m glad to see the slightly bonkers British eccentric is alive and well
Yay
I want you to fix my life
Actually during WWII paratroopers used to shorten their shovels too so that on landing they would jab them in the ribs or thigh
Promise me that if you ever sell the house you keep this a secret from the buyers. Discovering your house has a secret tunnel must be the trippiest thing ever.
5:28 XD
I'd almost lost faith in Colin until the hydraulic pump and the jack hammer showed up.  I was really hoping for something like a small boring machine....
" #minecraft " haha love this
U know...using a spade with a pointy blade would probably make this a whole lot easier.
I’m going to do this when I have my own house
So what happens if there's a earthquake and you should add a emergency oxygen system in case of a cave in or if something happens
I love it
I think the whole "doing this quite like" went out the window in the first episode with the jack hammer and wet saw.....lmao. Just saying.
I can't wait for the next video keep them coming!!! I want one an under ground tunnel hanaha
So freakin’ awesome! Can’t wait for the next episode!
This is what we all wanted to do wean we where kids
Mmhhhh, me wonders if Colin has had numerous issues with his neighbours in the past!
Colin this very cool…but extremely dangerous. You really need to look into how much bracing you should have to hold back that earth. There are all sorts of rules and regulations around digging holes and using proper bracing…and they are in place because people die all the time from collapses. Please be careful and look up proper bracing.
He just, DEPOSITS THE SOIL
TOM! What a legend!!!
Really makes you think of the work needed for Tom Dick and Harry.
Care for oxygen 😉
Is this legal? - I would need a permit for something like that where I live...
You require a team of Irish men
That looked like really hard work but fun at the same time, looking forward to your next instalment......  P.S.     Did you get the planning permission :)
I love doing that in the game 7 days to die, I spend more time underground than above ground haha
Dig a tunnel dig dig a tunnel
You think it would be weird to hang out in a shed blasting music with your friends? Colin, half the time in Canada we can't get the car in the garage because we're partying in there. You know, where you can plug in a beer fridge and a stereo.
Enjoying tunnelling? Go check out Turbo Conquering Mega Eagle!
Don't mine straight down 🤣😂🤣😂
That fuckin' add read was MENTAL. Love it. You're brilliant.
Everyone's talking about the progress on the bunker, and I'm here just thinking about how the hydraulic pump he put in his workbench in February 2019 was for this bunker expansion and not just a generic addition.
Where is the Safety Canary
Cant you make The videos shorter. That was ironi
I swear we've seen him both install the pump before and the comment of the christmas tree?
COLIN, I hope you get to set this comment.  Ref: entrance.  Many years ago I went pot holing in Wales, we had to exit one system up a climbing ladder only to pop out of an old metal type dust bin. Maybe you could use an oil drum in a similar fashion?  Good luck with the dig.
you know it would be interesting to use a metal detector and check if you dug out history maybe ;)
I see an opportunity to build a huge shop-vac to remove dirt....
Should of hired those jungle tribesmen that build the pools they would have had it done in a couple hours
Now you just need a washery on top and you can cook your meth… 😂
Whooo hooo Rock and Roll!
#minecraft
Does his bunker increase the value to his house and does he even need to declare it
Да уж Николай,ты явно сумасшедший копать такой грунт!
Awesome  (;
Just watched this... Then 3 hours later I drive past that pub. That was weirdly surreal.
Nice  (;
As someone that has moved an incredible amount of soil in digging projects, an auger is something to consider. I use it to loosen clay and then I can remove the debris with conventional picks and shovels.
Double thumbs up!
Secret tunnel…. And here is the exact location behind me as I share this with millions. Hahaha made me laugh.
Hey Colin, Great to see the danish invader in the video! Looking forward to the next part in the saga! PS your freetrade link seems to not work
This is the best!! Amazing dedication, love it!
So guys I did some mining off camera
Colin you are a lunatic, but I love it!😂😂😂
This is absolutely MAD!  It took me all day just to plant some palms in the backyard.  Meanwhile, Colin digs a tunnel and builds a underground lair.
In the future if that house is ever listed on the market for sale can imagine the write up in the listing 😂
Everyone needs a secret tunnel in their lives.
Holy shit lmao
2021... colinfurze want's to do something silently. What a year.
I have water a meter down so I have to live vicariously through you.
When i was a kid, i dreamt of having Kitt the black pontiac and the semi truck.  And then a house with a secret tunnel like this.  I still havent stopped dreaming of those things.  Great tunneling Colin !
Is it possible to use  hydraulics to push in and pull out a metal cylinder taking material with it? Like a sample? Do this on repeat like 5 million times
7:30 hydrolic press video
Great project, but aren't you worried about it becoming a heat sink? The structure seems sturdy enough to prevent cave-ins, but you might wanna look into getting the place insulated imo
Real time Minecraft....cool..!
Brothers of the mine rejoice!
See I did something similar a few years back, but I used the dirt to fill in another tunnel. What did I do with my the dirt from that project? Take a guess
Should build a hydraulic hand held auger
Colin, nobody will know that you filled that box with dirt, they've tasted like dirt anyways since they changed the recipe a while back!
SECRET TUNNEL song intensifies
just close the hatch and dig. open it every 5 minutes for fresh oxygen
Colin, you could have just bought a 6 inch shorter shovel instead of showing of your cool TOYS!!
We need to find out where that draft and crack are coming from!!
Liked in 5 seconds
Building a secret tunnel * posts about it on YouTube *
I thought you built a workshop hydraulic system ages ago?
YES. The Great Escape! :D
its not secret if you post it on youtube
How can you dislike this video?
I really want to know, how the hell he manages to get planning permission for this stuff, seriously. and i'd love to see someone try put a valuation on his house with all this built in the ground
Do they not have wheel barrows in British land?
Get a jack hammer or so
You could try a hydraulic auger to move more dirt and get it broke up faster. Just an idea. Your the professional so it's up to you. Would be cool to see though
I'm in anguish that you're not using a hydrovac for this! As silly as it is, I hate the idea of you wasting so much time & effort on the manual digging.
looks like a mine. sick
what you need are some sound proof paneling's
Its totally a secret. He is only telling a couple million people. Shhhhhh!
Now Colin, just how legal is this?
Not a secret if everyone knows about it.
you shouldnt cover the dirt it looks sooo col
A conveyor belt/lift system for moving the soil could be made pretty quite. And it would look cool.  Or a rail cart that hooks to a vertical lift then back to horizontal track at the top.  Awesome video that brings out the dreaming kid in me, hence the ideas.
It’s funny how he does this in a shirt and tie.
Tunnel so secret, 555k people know about it so far!
Brilliant, just superb
I love and hate that he isn't my neighbor. lmao
I like how he got rid of the dirt in the store and pub and the band practice to cover the noise
He is basically playing Minecraft !!!
If you post it is it really secret? Great shit as always though keep up the inventions
Теперь ты знаешь что такое сапёрная лопатка=)
Now you just need to build a lift that will take you up and down. That way you don’t have to climb on a ladder
This is not safe if these dirt bucket will fall on you
I'm sure at some point they won't be able to hear noise from a jack hammer that deep underground right? I mean they dug out El Chapo without anyone knowing 😅😅
It a very cool project just wondering does he have to put the tunnel on his house plans?
Colin you must be made of energy ⚡..!
Just like Minecraft!
This is insanely dangerous without any kind of shoring in place for the soil. OSHA requires shoring in holes larger than 5-6 feet (1.5 meters). This is because construction workers die every year from cave ins. Even if your head is free and you get buried up to your chest in dirt you can suffocate within minutes because the weight on your chest prevents breathing.  I really want to see the end of this project. Try not to let it kill you first...  -*Edit* Full disclosure,  I am in the civil engineering fields. I have taken OSHA courses and have my certifications. Several of your videos have made me cringe out of safety concerns... This one might be the most dangerous though so I had to leave a comment.
idk why, but I think someday he will kill somebody and vanish afterwards. These are the vibes I get, when I see him. No hate I love his videos. xD
Why do I feel I've seen this video before but on a beach and digging sand ☺️ god I love watching your videos Mr furzey
That’s crazy took him a year to make this video 🤯🤯
Love the vids bro keep up that good work 💪
Absolutely awesome 👏👏👍👏👏
British Junkrat
Most people: Clean their hair by washing it. Colin, who is allergic to water: VACUUM GO VWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEFYOOMPH
roughly how many bodies could you put down there do you reckon? Asking for a friend
I'm too impatient for these videos. I prefer this over films.
Every wanna be bank robber out there: Take Notes!
This is like the underground beach hut on steroids
I originally thought that the quietness was just a bit because of all the other loud projects he has done, but maybe he did those at the times people were out too
I can't wait for the future video once it's complete , future tunnel expansion to the nearest pub cellar 😂👌
I love how he doesn't want people to know but he's put it on YouTube
Buy the time u are happy with it it will be time for a stair lift to get u down there
So that’s why my coco pops were full of dirt and my favourite pub was closed due to a suspected bomb threat
Given how uncommon this project is and how fearless you +conlinfurze are in trying solutions for your projects, I actually have something that would be quite cool and uncommon for your tunnel-digging! What if you were to make a conveyor (one vertical and one horizontal) to automatically get the dirt from where you are digging to outside your shed and into the large container that you are probably using? I mean you will no longer have to deal with the plastic buckets or the slow crane elevator. I am quite curious to see what you think of this!
but what about the windy hole? we want to know what's down there :)
This kind of looks like a bank hist
In conclusion he took go dig a hole and sit in it seriously
Day 7: In central Texas, you'd still be breaking up rocks. Soil? What's that?
6:08 that's what she said
OMG this is soo cool. i wish i had the money to do that!
When someone buys his house after him it’s gonna be really hard to explain the bunker and tunnel
Just wanted you to know that ⟟ love your videos and you are keeping me alive so keep up the good work 🥰🥰
yo im so excited i cant lie this dudes house is going to end up being a tourist attraction or something :) hahahah
making me sweat just watching it :D
👍
Colin you absolutely brilliant mad genius.
У тебя спина из титана что-ли??
So are you going to explain how you didn’t hit any pipes or anything on the way down and how do you know your not going to come across any on the sideways dig?
He's going to find a dinosaur skeleton or something for sure
Why did he do #minecraft?
Colin do you ever get the council turn up and just ask wtf you're doing? how do you get planning permission for a literal mancave
With 11 million subs.... is it really secret tho LOL
This guy needs an auger.
needs a lift , a mono rail and a rotating white leather chair and sharks with lazers etc
I would assume he made sure there were no utilities under his property? Don’t want to start digging and then hit a sewage or natural gas line 🤣
a mini TBM?    How hard can it be?
You should make something so when your inside the tunnel the rug can automatically cover the door.
Soil vacuum, and grout pump moving self consolidating concrete.
The video tags contain #minecraft :D
Long metal Pole with pointy end to dig into the harder soil. (Could even put other detachable digging attachments on the pole) You got enough clearance above.
Perfect place to store the bodys
incredible Oo can't wait to see
Was anyone else worried Colin was gonna fall into a mine? Just me? Ok.
my backhurts just to see you, Colin!!! nice work!
but where did the crack lead to??
I would spend the money for a conveyer belt to take the dirt outside
I appreciate how you're taking the comfort of your neighbours in consideration 👍
Colin mods a spade Me: "This is not the way. Wheres the electro-hydraulic drilling machine? Or some kind of sandworm from dune?" Colin "Now we need to dig side ways, do it quietly, for that we need to get all the hydraulic n motorised gear in here and build a machine" Me: "This is the way."
How much hour do this take?
You are really man. 👍
This makes me want to dig a tunnel in my own house
its a secret shhh, and posts it on the internet ha ha ha, why have you not built a tunnel boring machine? love your work keep it up mate
Amazing project :-)
U know a thing is secret when its posted on yt xd
It would be really cool if you would install such pipes they had in the mines to power pneumatic tools
Surely the fact that he is making a series of videos on it defeats the “secret” part of these tunnels.
2 words: Fucking lit
I have to ask... How did you ever get planning permission to build something like this?
Should use some sort of screw construction drill thing to remove dirt quietly
Secret is not so secret now lol
CAPS BECAUSE ATTENTION: What about the hole/cave/gasline/bunker/sewertank/tunnel you punched into ??????
How long until he makes a conveyor belt from the hole to a skip
wonder what permits he had to get for this?
We need more like right now 🤣
Despite the predicaments that the Iranian government responsible for blocking YouTube, I'm always trying my best to bypass the blackout and see your videos. One of the best of Colin's projects so far. You are the man. Keep up the good working and thank you for all your effort to make videos from your projects which are greats and also stunning.
You'd never be allowed to dig a hole that deep without shoring on an archaeological excavation.
*inserts obligatory minecraft pun/reference*
Tom cleans up nicely!
Don't know what to call the wedge?  Well, the hydraulic atomic wedgie of course...
El chapo would be proud
I think he should put solid sheets on the walls of the vertical tunnel and fill the external part with concrete, because in the event of a collapse, that clay will perfectly pass the containment mesh, and the stones as well (by its own weight) .
I play trumpet too
did you get planning permission for this one?
Still  the bunker wouldnt hold up in a bloody blitzkrieg.....🙈
Well, you ain’t moving anytime soon.
This is what the world has been missing, remember watching your old videos as a kid. Great to see large domestic projects like this return onto the channel.
Colin couldn't make it more obvious that the noise complaints are becoming abit too much.
Cool hydraulic tool, but you are aware of what a breaker bar is, don't you? A big heavy metal bar with a pointed or chisel head.    You just chip away, using gravity or a hammer to chip away at the dirt and clay.   You ever seen what those Primitive Living  guys can do with a metal tipped stick? Also, once you get past ground level, you really don't need much concern for noise, unless you are using a jack hammer, or some other impact type tool. For safety, I am glad to see you shoring up those walls, to prevent cave-ins.  They not only suck, but can be deadly
You are a positively crazy man. Greetings from Poland♥️
I was practically dying laughing For those bits That moment of jam session 😂 Eric Andre material right there Fun fact: wear gloves b/c not, blisters and open cuts on the hands feel like a 1000° burns my guy.
aint this guy a mad inventor? why not just make a big drill to help u dig down... with this dude literally any builds possibile
i would need a jackhammer where i live to do this its way to rocky in the mountains you cant even dig a hole a foot deep without hitting rock
Furze means Fart in German         😳🍑💨.
i love the name of that bar (definitely not a dane)
He makes reference the the vacuums that should have a jet engine on it
I still don't think filming it for the government is a good way to cover it up but ok
To stop more noise, close the lid when your digging. Also can't wait for part 3!! 😁😁😁
Take a Hilti. Works very well.
You are mad as a hater, but I love it!!
Wish i was as handy as this guy..
edward fox shirley was missing in the great escape, for that we have now colin, his hair just on the wrong side, but close enough
Never saw anyone so excited about digging a hole :D
For those of you who pay for the privilege of having no adverts from this godforsaken platform.. and DO NOT WISH TO HAVE TO DIGEST MORE SALES BULLSHIT.. skip from 4.42 to 6.10.  Yes another 1.5 minutes of wasted airtime. I'll never buy force fed crap. Even from you, Colin. Carry on.
How can it be a secret tunnel when you've told everyone on YouTube 🤣
You should use a post hole auger
While everyone was on lockdown,colin digdown
Colin, why don't you just gift your neighbors nice holidays? :D I'd take it if I was your neighbor :)
Absolutely ace Colin! Are you going to do a crawl along railway similar to  The Great Escape?
I'm glad it doesn't take this long when I need to spend the night in a hole in Minecraft
Colin is Awesome nice Work  Greetings from Germany
Not so SECRET anymore, huh?
Do you need planning permission for underground things? 😂
This is incredible
Tu as vreeeuument un crack toi 😂😂  D'ailleurs il y a des français ici ?
Kinda reminds me of the Forestiere Gardens in California.  Massive underground network dug with hand tools, by one guy.
👍😎🍺🍩🛠️
The not so "Secret Tunnel"...
I'd love to do shit like this. But I'm poor as hell...
Wait.  For how long has he been planning this.    Did he put the pump op for the hole or for the press????
Make a hydraulic drill
All theses precautions to be as quiet as possible... Neighbours should have though, "hmm, Furze is unusually quiet theses days, seems strange." :p
wonder what mrs furze has to say about this whole mess
At first I was like, wait he has installed a hydraulic pump like years ago. But then I remembered he started this in 2018 and I was like Oooh.
The sound in the Tunnel is awesome!
Surprised there are no carefully shaped tannerite charges. Come on its just your house.
(Covers noise) 500k views in 3 hr
props for digging the whole hole with ur hands
You brighten my life Colin 💛 🇬🇧
Is there anything this Geezer can't do?   I'd love to have him on site.
You can't see that kind of project nowhere else on youtube,  keep going man !
When does the conveyor belt system to shift the dirt get build ?????
the 320 dislikes are just jealous people this awesome
This is amazing!!!!!
What no elevator?
I just love the idea to build a "secret" tunnel...on Youtube.
Me: wouldn't it be cool to be his neighbour and sometimes ask about what he's doing and stuff?  Colin: no one will even know if I'm alive or dead for quietness is my priority.
Is there a way you could make a miniature pneumatic tunnel boring machine?
Should we be concerned about how the tunnels are starting to look like Pablo’s Escobar’s tunnels?
I hope tunnel won't collapse while being developed
POV: Colin has a mental breakdown digging a tunnel
Why did he make this vid? He's just listening to music and having band practice in his workshop?
An entrance covered by rocks and rubble
Saddam Hussein
Did anyone else get nervous seeing him in that hole with no bracing? Even after he added bracing I've got to working about foundation issues and water erosion.
10:49 you're obviously getting closer to China
Ah I see you've teamed up with John Deere's arch nemesis..
ah yes .. #minecraft
I think Colin is a little bored
A few Mexicans is what you need
He keeps secrets like i keep hospital appointments.   Im so weak and my hair is falling out.
Colin woke up and chose minecraft
As cool as this is, you are walking a very thin line, between life and death.
Bloody Brilliant!  I'm excited!!
I wish the construction workers next door were as considerate as you in regards to the noise they make XD
Please do more big projects like this, love the underground stuff it’s very entertaining🙏👍👍
Is all of the ground clay?
YOOOO COLIN PLEASE BUILD SECRET PASSAGE WAYS IN YOUR HOUSE
UnDecor was probably your best work tbh
kinda cute how you tried to cover the noise of your shovel after jackhammering the floor of your shack :P
Build fallout weapons (use fireworks for Fatman)
So Colin, when do you put in the lift?
Oh shit, this man has reached the video footage of April 2021 so the next videos are gonna get uploaded at a very slow rate
You need a Terrierman Colin! 👍🏻👍🏻
I am so excited by this project ! Crazy job !
Hey, neighbors here. We know what you're up to.
OMG the origin story of the hydrolic pump under the work bench
Colin, your humor never ceases to amaze me :)
Dude, you're my hero.
Coolbeens
Colin the council must love you when you turn up for planning permission
When he said "Tom" I genuinely expected Tom Scott to come in and help him dig
This is so cool, and it gives me ideas for my garden. Its not that big so only way is up or down
Tom is brilliant, his mad eyes! 😂
Radon levels safe?
When Colin has a mental break he builds a tunnel, when my dad had a mental break he hit me.
It’s amazing how one man (with a few friends) make an entire cave system in just a 2 years
... is the winch strong enough to lift you out of the hole? that'd be a fun exit lmao
He's minecraft steve in real life
I could see a cart/elevator on tracks that he can use to lift heavy things (like those buckets of dirt or the hydraulic pump he uses for digging) out of the hole. Maybe make the top of the cart wedge shaped so it can open and close the hatch. Then he could put a lock on the bottom of the hatch to keep people from following him when he is making his escape from the shed
collin furze = NO DONT SKIP THIS BIT!!!! me = but its not available in Australia    just to let everyone know about humanity my $4000 bike has been stolen from the school i am going to
No one:  Colin: It must be built in secret with no noise and will be posted on the internet for the world to see.
Thais guy is building a secret tunnel even though he is showing 11 million people 😂
This is tagged with #minecraft

Your musical talents are as bad as mine. Thanks we share same talent of sounding like nails on a chalkboard. I also wonder where you can find a chalkboard.
More, i need more!!! I love it!
Be careful, if you dig to far in the wrong direction you might end up in France.
Hey Colin remember to put ventilation in there other wise you may die
Eyyy thought I recognised that Nosebleed song! Love those guys!
I can't figure out if Colin is improving or ruining the resale value of his house.
So to help hide the fact you're building a tunnel you upload your progress and show the plan on Youtube... Smart, I LOVE IT :D
Tf right Abbot Faria from the Count of Monte Cristo
He should really drink a bottle of water. :)
Buy and Hodl 💎🦍
Any methane gas coming in that crack?
Collin, I'm not going to lie, I am slightly disappointed this tunnel isn't going to the pub.
My back it hurting just watching
💪💪💪💪
When Colin sells his house he's going to have to explain a lot
the funniest thing you can install later is an elevator, a friend of mine has one in his bar to get into the storage in the basement, it has two small doors that open when the elevator goes up.
*insert "don't dig straight down" joke here*
You can tell he does not know that he should not dig straight down.
This is pretty cool! :)  Just a friendly suggestion, as you work your way further, it might become important to have a forced air ventilation set up to keep fresh oxygen down there where your working.
What types of clay?
Class lad
I was always wondering what he was really using that pump for... Well, guess i know now!
Love it 😬😜
Verry secrte that tunnel !!
Who didn't dream about digging a secret tunnel as a kid?
I will never comment your video again because you gave me to much cheap shit to look at I loved your channel back then but today you just so mainstream .will not unsubscribe but will only watch videos that really tigger me
Furz is building a DIY TBM next then?! He's already got the hydraulics started! ...Hydraulic motor powered cutters? 😜 As always; Great stuffs, much giggles! Cheers for entertaining the hive mind!
This is mint can’t wait for next part
*secret tunnel* *shows to millions of people* I just have one question... Will there be cabbages?
saddam hussain be like
Yet another epic project taking shape. At this rate, Mr. Furze should be shortlisted to receive the Youtube equivalent of a knighthood for his dedicated services to the crazy ideas and inventions industry, if there is such a thing.
Ive always wanted a secret bunker with a tunnel, so cool to see you doing this! You will always have my support Colin. Thank you for the videos
I'm curious if he ends up building something like a small hydraulic boring machine
Really can't wait till next video
I've always thought that Colin has the biggest balls in the UK for wearing a tie close to things with sharp blades and the torque of a small car.
He definitely used the winch to get in and out of that hole.
*Making a secret tunel  10 mil people waching this: interesting
This is wonderfully insane
I love these videos, they always remind me of my love of engineering and my hatred of British punk music
If he lived next to me I say make had much nose as you need
What minecraft teaches, is, never dig straight down! You're lucky there were no lava down your shed C:
Colin: " I need to be quite so the neighbors don't hear me"  Neighbors: " humm what's this video on YouTube from Colin furze in my recommendations" (clicking sounds on mouse) plays video.
@colinfurze I just deleted a comment because I was suggesting using hydraulics but you may have got it wrong. Rather than making a hydraulic jack hammer you should have made a hydraulic post hole digger where the hydraulic ram turns forward & back motion into centrifugal motion to spin a post hole digging attachment that you can manually push up or down. As you add extra joining attachments you can extend your holes up to 6m deep then manually clean out the rubble.
mole man
Be weary of any crack that moves that much wind.   12:20  I loved the mashup with the lockdown headlines edited over the clock. Very fitting.
9:35 I so much waited to hear you say "I think now we've hit....rock bottom"
Daniel from #ashville should help out!
This is exactly like the tunnel Saddam Hussein used to hide in
You need a wider bet
I have thought about this for so long
Furze, the only man who would build a tunnel to rival the Chunnel in his back garden, practically solo...
Can You Make Premiere Video Public For Every one suggestion from 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
Well it's not that secret if you document it... 😂
Really dangerous
Stalag 17?
👍
Hi
Colin minding his buisness building a tunnel.  Avatar hippy's start singing
Ever seen the movie holes?
I wonder what your neighbors think because they would definitly hate me
The fact that Colin is being quiet is probably making the neighbors worried 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
HOLEY
4:05 sounds like every taco bell night  and its beautiful
Love all the Great Escape references!! 😄
E
This is getting out of hand mate.
Colin is just Boris's long lost cousin
Did anything come of that draft? Did you find out where it went?
How did the prison guards not catch you? Can we get a kickstarter going to pay for this man's bail?
clicked the link for Freetrade but the app isn't available in Australia :(
Did anyone ever tell you that you are certifiable? And I love it! Please take care for cave in's.  By the way I have heard nothing here in the netherlands. So I think your secret is safe!
Wooooowww
why does this vid have tag of minecraft???
I just love love love this guy sooo muchh❤️
@colinfurze, Do you have another job outside of YouTube? Love your content smexy :0 ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🥚🤌🏻🧂
And bit noisy though if you're trying to be quiet
I really hope what i remember is true and he is finnished building it already because if not i am extremely scared that that wall's foundation will colapse in. Entire side of a condo collapsed and killed ?9? Now and there is still 150 something people still missing. The current cause is thought to be A CRACK IN THE FOUNDATION plus some other minor issues that you would expect. And he is digging the entire side of his house? 😬 Kinda makes me nrveous
If he found a massive cave behind that crack he would officially be batman
I need one of those concrete drill guns with a flat speed and on it work like a shovel and a pic real easy to get into hard stuff
Only a few minutes in and I am surprised Colin did not make an over engineered gas powered flame shooting conveyor belt across his yard to help remove the dirt.
Same day today upload with NightHawkInLight 🙂
When I buy the house, I'll get you to do the restructuring plan!!! I will provide room and board..🤣🤣 A greeting from Italy, you are number one..
I would love to be attending the first meeting with the real estate agent when this house is going for sale and also all the presentations for the possible buyers...." Does the house come with a basement?"..." well...you see..." LOL
Oi, ya got a permit fo that mate?
Man, everything is cool boit this channle, sept... English people
I just realize there is a hashtag called #minecraft
yo boiii hes digging
Turning the Internet up to 69 more like! No1 will EVER do what YOU DO!
mineros los 33!!!!!aajjajajaj
Why is there a minecraft hastag?! 😂
I just assumed the neighbors would've become accustomed to loud noises over at the Furze residence.  "Oh that's just Colin getting on with his crazy builds."  "What do you think it will be this time Marge?"  "Oh I don't know Nan, probably something large and wobbly."  "Oh Marge you're not thinking what I'm thinking are you?"
So... you are fan the Bet Cave or Fallout, aren't you? 😏
Hahaha that Tom was going to go any further on that horn looks like he was going to pass out
The HOA Probably hates this man
Every kids dream right there.
Any plan’s for the channel’s 15th birthday this November?
You should use a magnetic handle just so the door can stay flush the the floor
never dig straight down
What ya need is, a couple of spoons and a vaulting horse. 🤔🤣🤪
Bro please invest in a wheel barrow
Realistic MINECRAFT lul
Cool but the digging tool u made is bull shit
Man, seeing the footage of you putting in the hydraulic system and thinking back to when that video was...you've been at this for so much longer than I think any of us thought you have! Super cool!
Oh no, Berlin is at risk!
New subscriber from NYC. Is Kaleb available to assist from Jeremy’s farm?
As a suggestion, might make an auger attachment to your hydraulic setup
Secret tunnel.     477.554 views so far.
"SECRET" - literally shows it to  millions of people to see 😂 anyway very cool project as always, can't wait to see the final result 😁
All the drug lords going to see this and be hiring you to break them out of HMP  😂
No risk of geting the whole thing filled with water, when its Rain?
Will it be a walking tunnel or a crawling tunnel? Or maybe a powered sled tunnel where you sit on something that moves through? Electric scooter tunnel? (I'm just being silly by that point, but still) For quite powered digging, what about one of those garden augers but a high torque electric motor?
Inspired by The Great Escape I see
I´m not an architect or something but i guess you should reinforce those walls a lot more (with concrete for example) to prevent damage on your house. the foundation of your house could move and or crack.
Wait a minute… Colin did a „Shop hydraulic system/conversion“ over two years ago and now he had to install a pump to power the Cylinder 🤔🤔 This Video must be over two years old !!!
Keeps everything quiet so no one knows . . . then posts a video of it on YouTube.
Ha ha !  I just knew the sock full of dirt trick was coming!!  Furze you are a legend!!!
wait why wasnt he worried about noise in pt 1
Can you make a video with "stuffmadehere"
It makes sense now why the gadget king wants a bat cave he clearly intends to become a cape crusader lol. By way you must investigate that cavern with a camera?
wheelbarrel are overrated i guess!
Geotechnical Professional here. I know safety might not be your major concern, but what you are doing has some serious risk of instant death to it. You seem to have considered collapse and the soil and bedrock you've discovered seems to be stable. That said, please please please either monitor the atmosphere or install ventilation. If you start running equipment at depth, you may displace the oxygen and just fall asleep (followed by death). This is a very cool project, I would hate to see you die for it. (P.S. there are many other concerns for you to take into consideration. Please at least talk with people who know about tunneling to help you mitigate the very real possibility of instant death.)
Very cool
colin furze in 2040:  i built a whole town underground with working electricity and items
Altest nice music.
I know it’s done already, but you should’ve used an auger for the dirt breakup and digging….it’s kinda like it was made to do that.
Who needs to go to the gym when you’re tunneling?
Or boat dock
Gopher it Colin keep digging!
Lets see if we can find a dead body ;)
Next episode, the making of the Colin Furze tunnel boring machine please?
4:14 being a trumpet player hearing that is almost offensive LOL
The kid who bought cereal but ended up with rocks be like: What- are the rocks what makes the cereal- wtf are these shitty old rocks.
You could just build a big mega vacuum and suck the loose dirt out to avoid bucketing
I wonder if you can build an under the hanger
The "band practice" bit was hilarious! I thought he was going to pass out playing that trumpet!
A wheelbarrow would've helped...
Secret tunnel!! Secret tunnel!! Through the mountains secret secret secret secret TUNNEL!!
Just thought to myself: "ok he's using a simple shovel and a pickaxe. No way he's not coming up with some crazy self-built tools within the next 10 minutes..."
I can't help but think maybe a small digger and a auger would have worked a tad better, but either way its secret tunnel and they be cool
Wtf didn't you get a power auger?
What about the crack? blind?
you got a loicense for thot hoile?
in France we have Barnabé Chaillot, he is a little like you but not like you
Hey @colinfurze why don’t you just mak the shed sound proof?
Surely you can rig up some sort of reverse jaws of life that close as the ram pushes forward ? , or better still brace the digging arm from a mini digger against a wall and use it , maybe sliding on a pole so its adjustable ?
This is awesome
I bet the council planning team love you.
GIT :D
Aint really a secret, is it 😅
Duuuude you made an awesome list of sh*t, but this, this may be the best thing on the internet
Lord let this man hit a gold pocket so he builds more wacky stuff.
🎵 Secret tunnel! Secret Tunnel! Through the backyard! Secret, secret, secret, secret tunneeeeel!! Yeah. 🎵
It puts the lotion in the basket
Let me know if you need a hand Colin... Would love to help!
You should build a giant drill for tunneling! :D
I was waiting for the cops to roll up because of an anonymous tip from one of your concerned neighbors assuming you're murdering and burying people in your shed.
i mean its not that secret if its online?
Hes unstopable
Post it noww
He is going to end up closing himself in there to keep quiet, he’s gonna had oxygen and lights and just become a mole for a month
He is going to end up closing himself in there to keep quiet, he’s gonna had oxygen and lights and just become a mole for a month
3:49 Your neighbors must really love you. ❤️
This is getting a elevator right?  Right?????
Top
Did you call 811 before digging?
Colin do you need planning permish for that or just went ahead regardless hehe
Hello
Those trusty Wham buckets never let you down!
🖤🖤🖤🖤
Maybe some kind of drill system to go sideway. Also If you build a large screw thread inside a tube and stick a hopper on the bottom and make it high enough out the hole to get your bucket/wheel barrow under you could drop the soil in and it should make its way up top save you using buckets.
Я: Копаю окно в Европу. Колин: Копает окно в Россию. Туннели скоро соединяться и можно будет ходить коротким путем. Мой учитель географии: А чё так можно было что-ли!
Brilliant!!!
i have no idea why you are doing this, but I am very happy that you are
Ytp: coin faze digs an illegal tunnel to el chapo
If he’s gonna sell his house that wil be one hell of a tour
You have 11M subscribers, it’s not a secret entrance
What happened to the crack? Did it lead to anything?
Why did you reuse the clip of the hydraulic pump installation
Freetrade account creation failed. Demanding ID documents.  Not going any further.
Id be scare AF of that collapsing in on me, did you already have the knowledge of the safety aspect of this or did you consult anyone? And I'd just like to say, I've just spend 14mins watching a man dig a hole.
I usually skip all ads on all channels but you're one of the few ones that makes them funny and unique. Like SalviaErik.
thats the same hydraulic setup he built years ago isnt it?
For when colin is going to sell his house it would go like this. real estate agent: So yeah you see it's quite a normal house we got here, but there is a twist, cause underneath this house there is a underground bunker AND a secret tunnel.  Customer: WHAT!!! so how much is this house worth?  Real estate agent: Well Im not sure I havent had a house like this. What would you like to bid on it cause we have like hundreds that want it.  Customer: Its like a dream for me, so I will bid everything I have
Maniac at work. Loving it
Just imagine if Colin ever tried to sell his house and what the estate agent would say.  "It's a lovely 3 bedroom home, with treadmill in place of staircase......outside there's a shed, oh yeah the previous owner did build a bunker under the garden.....and there's a tunnel that links the bunker to the house via the workshop/garage."
4:59 is he hoovering  his hair?
You do realize a secret clandestine project like this is no longer a secret ... IF YOU POST IT ON YOUTUBE !
Can you make a electric scooter 🛴
Surprised you haven't run into ground water.
*_Kellogg's Coco Pops!???_*  Wait...wha...wha...Wait a minute! You Britons have a Kellogg's cereal that we don't have in America??! ( _at least I've never seen those at any store that I've visited here in the Northeast_ 🤔) *NOT FAIR!* 🤨
а для чего он это копал всё ?
14:07 Your Capitol is at risk? I see what you did there ;)
Lot of clay in that soild, maybe make some pots :D
Colin can you show us your muscles? I'm curious
Biri türkce altyazi eklesin artik ya :/
That's quite some shaft you have Colin🤣
This is like enjoyable claustrophobia
Best project ever! Watching now and  you are going to end up with big guns !
lost
“Oh and there is a full equipped bunker on the property.” “Was the previous owner one of those crazy apocalypse prepers?” “No just a lunatic with an engineering degree.”
Man, the cookie jar bit really got me haha.
The cooling vent of that electric motor is awfully close to the sidewall of that bench.
How “secret” is this tunnel I wonder, when 3 million people have already watched this video???
I want to come help on a project.  And I thought I had cool tools in my garage, until watching this hero in action
This is so amazing, I've always wanted my own tunnel
I’m just picturing the estate agent speil about this house…
What about if I already have an account...
Reallife Minecraft.
I should quit my gym membership and start digging.
Waiting next of this video
Colins expectation - “I need to be quiet to avoid suspicion”  Reality with neighbours - “hmmm Colin is very quiet. I’m suspicious??”
He’s quite clever. Not only is he earning money from the video, but also his sponsor, and by doing this is increasing the value of the property. I don’t get all the pretend keeping this a secret though if he’s uploading it for the world to see.
This is soooo coool!! I hope he makes a Lift!!
Colin’s neighbor, walking to get their mail. *sees giant mound of dirt and foundation* “Welp, He’s at it again”
So you're saying your band is a ska band.
1:37 Shawshank flashbacks
Anyone else thinking Silence of the Lambs?
This is just insaaaaaane!!!!! I love it!!!!
Part 3, please, can't wait 👍😎 the danish invader, where is that located? Great project, full of respect.
The first thing you have to do when building a secret tunnel is DON'T TELL ANYONE and keep it to yourself.
Move over Big Dick Energy, I now aspire to Manic Colin Furze Energy
😂🤣😅😆😀😁😃
how can digging a hole in the ground be so bloody exciting!!
The man dug a tunnel. In a tie. Balls of steel only the rest of us can dream of having.
Minecraft in real life
Colin, you need a wheelbarrow!
I love the idea but it not much of a secret now
Minecraft be like
Who else is watching this and taking notes? Lolol
Is the tunnel secret because there's no planning permission? 👀🤣 But I would like to know what the local council think lol
This man has harnassed the power of ADHD
How does your wife just say "yeah you can build a tunnel under my house"
Diggy diggy hole...... Diggy diggy hole!
Colin Furze is by far the coolest and craziest guy in UK.  I don't want to be his neighbour 😂
Next video: MAKING A FUNCTIONAL MISSILE SILO IN MY BACKYARD
Okay. the silent hydraulic digger is simply, insanely genius. <3
04:00 Irish tunnel workers 1883, colorized
Will the electric engine from the pump will get enough air ciculation in the table? Those things can get really hot. Sufficient cooling is not optional.
Who cares about the noise, I would love to be his neighbor
you do know about wheelbarrows right?
Why on earth is it marked with #minecraft?
Free trade ad ends at 6:05
Now we know who was the guy who built the tunnel for "El Chapo" xD
Never thought watching a man dig a hole would be so exciting!
Underground bunker is what brought me here. This is just better
10:40 Its connected to the neighbours bunker i think... :-()
Use a drill? A core drill faster and silent
Elevator?
So he didn't bury the bodies there, then.
There is a pub called The Danish Invader!?!?! as a Dane I feel a strong urge to invade that place and buy all their beer!!
Since you have that hydraulic system in the shop, it wouldn't take to much time or Fab work to build build yourself a horizontal boring system. Make digging out a little less labor intensive using the lift to hold it up even.
surprised you didn't build a conveyor belt for all the muck
Where is the airvent, fan, and entrance covered by bricks and rubble
Weld a suppressor onto a jack hammer easy!
Bro u are one crazy guy u know that
You, sir, have managed to raise silliness to new levels with almost every new upload.  Your silliness rivals Beyond the Press YT channel's inspired stupidity.  Might there be a collab in the future?  Those Finns exhibit the same type of mania as do you.  It would be amusing, if nothing else.
Where does the hole go? I want to know where the draught hole goes
Hey bro can get a channel shout out...love all your videos 📹and continue too...much love bro
Surely "Great Escape"theme would speed up the big dig!!
Colin might as well build an underground workshop so he can work and be completely silent.
So Colin is basically the British real life version of Dilbert comic
I'm very surprised that you didn't build a turbojet powered conveyor belt to shift your rubble outside to a skip. The sight of you and Tom, in nice schmutter, digging a hole, in a shed, with Trombone and Cornet accompaniment, made me cry with laughter, and made my Thursday.
You need the guys that build those temples in the middle of the jungle.
Wow !....cheers.
If that is clay, you can consider making brick.
Assuming you had unlimited energy, could the waste dirt be melted, compressed, and used as walls?
Colin, mate, you're nervous about people hearing you dig.  I think your neighbours would be more nervous when they don't hear such noises. "What's Colin up to?"
I need to run new wiring out 120 feet to my garage. The conduit is collapsed under the drive way........   I have an idea...
I really wanna do that my dad would kill me 😂😂😂
The ole covid excuse.
Ha. IBM...
MORE BUNKER CONTENT HELL HEA!
Not so secret when you upload it to yt. XD
I'm tottaly your sins i saw your channel 5 years ago. I'm pissin my pants every upload 🔥
He should have hired the primitive Indonesian guys, they’d make him a full underground mansion with a crowbar 😂
Yo I hope there is a resolution to where that wind is coming from!!!
You should just have called those indians who dig swimpools holes in the forest with a stick
What if your neighbors watch the video though? 🤔
Best show on the net!
Perfect example of how you make people not skip the add parts of your video.
Between colin and whislindiesel I don't think I could click on the video faster than when I see there's pop up to watch. Keep up the solid work mate.
*El chapo has entered the chat*
I have the feeling he will buy the neighbors propertys at one point in the not too distant future anyways :D
Shows blueprint. Not secret
that hole really looks like a mineshaft especially with the lights 12:39
Goddamn London clay!!
Your videos just brighten my day. 😋
becoming el chapo part 2
Man is literally increasing the real estate value of his property into the millions
Local Council meetings must be interesting "We have had some moments about Furze again.."
A whole year, u should have contacted a mexican contractor!
+12!
If i was collins Neighbour I would be more worried if he was quiet instead of loud banging and shouting
What's with the cave? (:
Real life Junkrat
Disapointed Colin didnt make a fully automated wheelbarrow…
Minecraft!!!
Did you leave the dirt In the store?
your videos are amazing!
It puts the lotion in the basket, or else it gets the hose again
I'm absolutely buzzin with this project 🤪 can't wait to see it finished
I would have imagined he'd make some sort of earth drill with a conveyor in it to remove the dirt.
Legend has it that Colin vacuums his hair ever morning
ROFL at the Coco pops.
The furzemeister uploads, today is a good day
Any dead animals found under there lol
Love your shit mate
Remember. Don't dig straight down
Oh I love this. Really love this. What I've been waiting for since 2005. Really.
I'd have used a gas powered auger . Would have made work quicker
What did that crack lead to?  Is there a cave or something???
This is where Saddam Hussein hid
lol we have the same vacuum cleaner and the same hair vacuuming habit :p
Colin, what has the council had to say about this new addition to the house/land?
This looks safe...
ok wau. That's probably his best video ever. Just his sponsors get worse.
How do you get planning permission for all your renovation projects?
This is looking like the Collin bat cave
That lockdown newspaper effect at the end was cool
Colin your a legend! Looking forward to seeing a Shakespeare bust entrance switch with grandfather clock hidden entrance in the house 👍 to the "Furze-cave"...
I think at this point you legally have to inform your responsible mining authority if not get a permit.
HEY, If you run into China,, Order me up some Chop Suey Please! Great Vids. Thanks :)
👍
Is this legal?
How did you deal with Planning Permission
Hey Colin let me know when you finished building your secret bunker because I really like it
Love the great escape reference
Will you explore the hidden Cave you found any further? I would be WAY to curious to not do it and find out how long, deep and huge it's probably is and where the wind comes from. :D
i guess is not a secret anymore
There is a guy who used an electric hammer drill to carve out a small place inside a hill.. ..it looks faster than using a handpick....
Colin…dig with water!  Vacuum it out.
I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole
My grandparents did this 1:26 in ww2 Yugoslavia to hide soldiers from Italian and German troops. They told me that the street, where the soil was dumped on in the night , got higher in 2 years for around 20cm. The street is around 30m long.
Is that a floby?
Do you need planning permission for stuff like this?
Dude he is so cool lol
So cool!
Colin im thinking steam punk flamethrower
Colin just casually swapping cereal boxes for dirt
You are the coolest!  Like Elon Musk cool!
He doesn’t know the rule don’t dig straight down
the minecraft cave update wasnt enough
That AD was genius. I am loving it.
lol did you get planning permission for this!? enjoying the vids, big fan of the channel
These Minecraft texture mods are getting out of hand
The lucky person who buys Collins house if he sells the t
This running joke about keeping it quiet is killing me because there's no way in hell a single of your other projects were done quietly. Lol
why arent you using wheele barrows instead of buckets😟
No wonder it took Andy dufresne so long
Getting coal mine vibes here. Haha.
builds a secret bunker and tunnel, films it all  XD
Nothing more manly than 2 men in a shed digging a hole all night lol
Get home from a hard day's graft and see a furze vid. Yes please!! Keep it up furze we love it
Awesome!
Lets gooooo bro
I want to see more can’t wait till Thursday
Did you ever find out what that crack was? Some of it looked a bit like a brick wall.
The neighbors are probably suspicious because it's so quiet!
You are getting crazier
So we not gonna talk bout the cereal 🥣
i love how he wants to keep it a secret but then he shows it to 11 million people
just imagine the neighbor wondering why Colin keeps hauling buckets of dirt OUT of his shed...
Top 10 people not to rob
Lol the #minecraft
Pablo Escobar likes this
#minecraft for good measure I see     But why though
Really excited for this one!!!!...❤️ from 🇮🇳
Making digging interesting is a bit of an art 😂
I was wondering when “The Great Escape” reference was going to pop up.
I think stashing in the grocery store might be illegal?
Once you surpass the nonsense layer you reach the limestone plate
Colin is living out all my childhood dreams
Can’t wait for the next video 😀😀😀
My man crush just got even bigger for You Colin ❤️ Wait did I just type that out loud 🤪
Hundred years on and the Tommies are clay-kicking again!
SECRETTTTT TUNELLLLLLL
Tomorrow's news headline "Hole appears in London Underground Tunnel - Strange Man Emerges!"
Minecraft in real life
IBM hilarious
Mexican drug cartels seeing the hydraulic tunneling device: Write that down, write that down!
Wheres saddam husseins hiding spot?
Tried downloading freetrade as I like the look of it. The app froze so had to redownload it. Now when I put my email in all the links say 'that links run out of magic please try again' WHY CANT THINGS JUST WORK. Update: after 15 mins it worked again
"To cover the noise so I dont disrupt the neighbors I've been playing really loud music"
Not sure why you added the hatch before even digging the tunnel.
mad man! the amount of labor to alone have a start!!! damn!!!
Ground breaking
this is the most epic project on youtube right now. By Far!
We wanted to do the same with my neighbours, to connect our houses. Sadly the groundwater table is just 1m below the ground…
Colin, I think a electric auger would probably help
Only Colin and his 11m subs know about this. Shhhhhhh.
PLEASE, PUT A CART AND RAILS TO MOVE LIKE MINECRAFT
The great escape is one of the best films ever👌👌
SECRET TUNNEEEEEL, SECRET TUNEEEEL, Through the Mountaaaaiiiins, Secret Secret Secret Secret TUNEEEEEEEEEEEL 🎵🎵🎵🎵
I love how Colin has an iPhone 5
That is AWOSOME 👊
i think the sideways not gonna work, cause you will have much ground on top of it. lets see how you will support it :D
He will never be able to sell his house.
@Colinfurze two things Hardhat and gas meter.... you may only be 12ft down but its still safety  And just get a compressor and a holman 303 rock drill that will make short work of it and maybe a stick or two of anfo for the tougher sections the neighbours don't need any crockery
just awsome!
This is awesome! Best project since the bunker!
Fill up sandbags with dirt and then you can useThem to line the tunnel
All i want colin to do finally is plant some trees in his home ultimate power and do solar energy.
IDEA: How about making a hydrophilic spinning digging drill & bucket convener system
Where to put all the dirt? Just dig another hole and put it in there 😂 🤷‍♂️
Love the "Great Escape" reference!
Wondered why my Coco Pops tasted weird this week.
Reminds me of the DDR …. Wen they would dig a tunnel to the BRD
I would recommend a concrete hammer SDS drill with a digging bit.....looks like it would save you HOURS!!  Or look into how they dug tunnels in WWI.  They figured out how to dig massive tunnels in almost absolute silence using a special made shovel and a board to lay against, it was called "clay-kicking".  Brilliant system.
you live a man dream :D
normal people live normally in their house  alpha chads:lets make a bunker with a secret entrance from underground
Idk why I found the point that he just took a pic axe to the floor and is digging all this by himself so funny
Wouldn't a lapidary drill with a diamond cup saw  work for that
I often wonder what Colin's relationship with his neighbours is like pmsl
My dream..
#TunnelVision
Colin is just a real life version of Wallace from Wallace and Gromit
How do you get approved for this!?
If covid turns us all to zombies, i will search you and i will find you. Than i will invade your bunker system
4:56 I've been doing for so long and I thought there are no other crazy people who do the same (vacuuming your hair)
0:15 yeah that looks real secretive... nobody will ever know there's a trap door there it blends in so well!!
Furze, how do you plan to get back up?  Oh, that's how.
Is it just me or does this seem like a modern version of the great escape.
The underground bunker was brilliant,this will be awesome 👏👏
I'm pretty sure this isn't Minecraft, but People who are interested in Minecraft are maybe probably likely to be interested in this video, so I guess tagging the video with Minecraft makes sense?
No. I'm thinking this isn't much of a secret anymore.
Use micro blasters or hydro basters to bust the rocks.
But... where was the breeze coming from
its all coming together look, most of his projects from the last TWO YEARS, all for digging this hole. Credit to Furze, i wouldn't the patience
what you going to do with the clay
I’m 70 years a new owner of the house is going to replace the rug only to find a crazy tunnel going to a bunker
This looks like it should be illegal xD
YouTube Latest: Man Digs Hole
What I can do in Minecraft in a day is taking Furze quite a while..have fun with that clay!!!
I swear, colin is like the exact same phineas and ferb but in real life and an adult
SECRET TUNNEL, SECRET TUNNEL!
Has anyone yet gone back and tried to spot when the other part of the project first appeared in other videos to get a timeline? IIRC the hydraulic system was a while ago.
Hello from the other side of the Channel! "mysterious piles of earth appear" You are going to create a local legend of the mole men of the hollow earth ah ah! This draft is an intriguing discovery , have you tried using a smoke to find out where the draft is coming out? Maybe one of your neighbors has a well. When you say "but where is your jet engine?" I thought you were going to build a suction drill like you see nowadays on urban construction site, but your pneumatic machine is undoubtedly a blessing for the peace of the neighborhood.
never dig directly down
You are crazy!
Bruh,now it cant be a secret, cant u just send me a message and say this 🤔
This is amazing.
Nvm
I don't think this will work, does this devalue your home and your that of your neighbours. Did you have to get planning permission?
Never knew Tom Lamb could play the trumpet as well! Is there anything that man can't do?!
I'm surprised you didn't build some sort of small excavator.
I hope you have a lot more help. Dirt is heavy as shit😎
wonder if you can create enough power to spin a tunnelboring head or at least the collin version of one should make digging the first part of the hole a bit eazier (round hole than dig down and flat to make the floor )
If the neighbors are mad at you then get a generous sponsor and make an offer to them to buy their house.  I tried to click the freetrade link but AVG says it's a "physhing threat" for some reason.
That feeling when you share your secret tunnel with 7 bln people on the internet, but hide it from your neighbours.
Awesome vid. Who brought you the bracket to hang the buckets from haha country person by any chance? Lol
how long ago was this filmed lmao
Heh tunnel
2050 there is now a secret underground civilisation under stamford
I hope you have a lot more help. Dirt is heavy as shit😎
the fun thing about this is very similar to egypt underground
All things considered that's a pretty sane tool he came up with! I was expecting a some sort of deadly spinning blade!
This is amazing, man... you are an absolute genius! Excellent work, looking forward to the next installment!
Really impressive!
Imagine he dig and finds a box full of treasure left by his Grandfather...
Secretly Colin lives next to a bank and he is planning something else 🤫
Imagine going inside the hide putting the carpet aside coming back and going through the tunnel to inside
Super secret!!!   As long as you don’t end up in the Queen’s garden!
Dig a tunnel, dig dig a tunnel, dig a tunnel dig dig a tunnel, dig a tunnel before the hyenas come!
Never clicked on a video from my front page this fast.
Why don't you make a screw for biggie to help.
He is one of the youtubers that puts my imagination into life! Thanks and I love urchannelll
Did you find where that Breeze but coming from?? ;
It's a cool project, i DIG it
You’re a MAD man……I love it. ! Great job, and yes .it’s labor intensive !
Sounds like you're having trouble with the is this residential work or commercial work on this property from the neighbours
I wouldn't trust the ground 😬
At that depth nobody's gonna hear anything.
What I really love about this is how he keeps touting it as a 'secret' even though his neighbors have been listening to the power tools and he has over a million subs! Worst kept secret ever lol!
I have never been so excited about a hole in the ground.
I did that with the hover Colin and now I have no hair 👨‍🦲
Doesnt he know? You NEVER dig straight down....
Now that's a hole!!
Be careful Colin. You might dig straight down into lava.
For the love of god you need to put some shoring up; you are playing with fire right now and not in a good way.
You should use a jackhammer
toilet lid up? Check toilet seat up? Check..?
Vacuum excavation would of saved you a hell of a lot of time and hard work haha 😄
it's super-secret to post it on youtube
Sorry if someone has asked this already, but have you had problems with your neighbors?
An electric post hole drugged drill.
Moria🧙‍♂️You fear to go into those mines. The dwarves delved too greedily and too deep. You know what they awoke in the darkness of Khazad-dum... shadow and flame🔥🔥🔥
I just know you are going to make this tunnel look insane 🔥🔥🔥
The wind blows outside and there's a draft coming from the hole. I was waiting for you to say you'd broken into the sewer system. 😂
I love that it's hashtagged as "minecraft"
Its funny how everything is secret and stuff, while he litterally shows it to millions of viewers XD
You make smile. I love your crazy shenanigans 🤣
3:55 - Two hedge fund managers digging a shallow grave for a dead hooker
I know some indian youtube channels that could help you with this
My uncle owns to house next door to each other he built a tunnel between then and to his garage
Secret tunnel through the garden secret secret secret tunnel
cant wait for part 3!
Do you need planning permission for this?
So no one else has noticed the #minecraft on the video?
Just how is this a secret Tunnel ?  At present 412,440 views 🤔
this is my childhood dream
My science teacher met u
Digging for gold 😂👔💎⛏️
What about a boring device to drill the tunnel out for you?
Seems like a lot of effort to do things quietly , when your just going to post what your doing online anyways.
No asbestos or anthrax sampling! Hope you don't come across anything of historical importance! Where's the bloody water table!
Now You are one step closer to having Your own personal Wayne Manor!
Minecraft IRL
An electric auger drill would make digging a lot easier.
does he have infinite money?
El Chapo would be so proud!
A good old military E-tool,  entrenching tool
what a mess :)
Half expecting a bucket to be lowered down and 'It rubs the lotion on its skin.......'
Would re appropriating the screw tanks screwy bits not help out on this?
Man I was expecting him to come up with a conveyor right away
Should of built a conveyor for the dirt
Day 2 of telling colin that you can’t open the trap door from underneath
He should just hire one of those people from one of those “dig a primitive underground house” videos. Then they can bring their crew that does the actual digging.
Why is Minecraft a tag?
Would re appropriating the screw tanks screwy bits not help out on this?
The Great Inscape  (IN the garden)
When I was digging a new pit for the mulching stuff (I bury all vegetable matter from garden & Kitchen, which saves on garbage and is healthier for the enviroment) I used my old pole holer,  which is basically a steel tube attached to a steel handle, with bent over angled blades on the bottom end.  This you screw into the ground and it basically cuts into the soil and forces the soil up the pipe, and you then just up end the pole holer every now and then and pour the loose soil out onto your pile (or in your case into the bucket).  Eventually you've got lots of holes to just break away instead of one solid mass.  Makes it easier to dig a pit, especially in the root system that pervades my foresty land.    It strikes me that a hydraulic version of this idea with a giant vacuum cleaner style pump to suck the soil and debris out of the holer would be a workable solution for digging both down and sideways to make the side tunnel.   Its a thought anyway.
this is more epic that the bunker itsef
He's playing Minecraft IRL, now that's what I am talking about XD.
I am literally just sitting here in a dumbfounded silence thinking “this man is insane!” I love it.
You are better to diy the shield tunneling machines.
Look at building a "chainsaw" digger! They use them you cut out channels in ground
Hang on a min Colin didn’t you already have a hydraulic pump there and comment on the Christmas tree when you did the press or have I just cottoned on that this tunnel was done ages ago lol
A predict a ridiculously dangerous home made microtunnel coming up. You've got the hydraulics, the hose pipe. Pretty much half way there. Can't wait.
TITEL:  DIGGING A SECRET TUNNEL Part 2   VIEUWS: 436.065 = no secret lol  (edit) in 2 year's he lives undergound XD
Literally just building a cool Minecraft in real life
Somewhere theres a cartel member watching taking notes lmao.
Colin, Quick question did you ever think about using a Power Auger for the initial dig of the Tunnel? I have a feeling that it would have made it so much quicker and easier for You.
Colin: Limestome Me:Bedrock
I'm ready for the ECONOMIC COLLAPSE, I own 0xMonero, a privacy focused cryptocurrency.
Why not use small amounts of explosives rather than hydraulics?
entrance covered with rocks and rubble
I think in WWII they named a tunnel after Tom!
Merci mec, c'est ouf !!
The air coming out of that crack in the ground has to lead somewhere. I must know!
* claustrophobia intensifies *
you know he watched ''the great escape'' more than 50 times doing this  also: 12:36 ''it puts on the lotion or else it gets the hose again''
imagine your the next owner of this house I'd be chillin' in that bunker for years non stop
This project remind me the first video i saw from Colin, the beach hub
Mad man
Take the sticker and paint off your shovel, sharpen the tip a bit; helps cut into the earth and it slide off when dumping into a bin, especially in that wet clay looking battle that lied below the surface.
Kinda wish someone could go down and create one of those 3d maps using sound waves or something to see what that crack/cave thing was about. Like you've seen people make maps of caves and tombs on National Geographic
Isn't this the guy from lemonade mouth
My brother and I once dug a 6’ hole in our backyard in 2 days when we were really young. Hit a wire of some sort and our whole neighborhood’s internet went out for a week. Good times 😎
oof
I'm going to put it out there and say its not all that secret now, is it?
gates to the hell :D
This isn’t YouTube, a new series of Bob the builder lol. I tell you what Colin, when you plan something, you perfect it mate 😉great video buddy
Two lovers, forbidden from one another..
Now the underground sandcastle house makes sense
Just bury the bodies and fill it back in already....
I am so unbelievably excited for this build Colin, I need an episode 3 asap, just watching the dig process is keeping me entertained! You should do a livestream of the dig!
He digs in a tie. That's dedication
at the end of this colin will have another colin in waight instead of his back
I wonder what during digging a tunel you can found under a lot od dirts and rocks.
2h
Colin..   Did your mate hoist you up by your belt. 😂
That looks like proper tough physical work! Great project though. Makes me grin 😀
Jules Verne: "Been there!"
Going to take years
Really like this cuz I was recently digging a well by hand for geothermal purposes (testing). Learned a little about local geology during the process which was interesting. Now Im always thinking of ideas about how to drill and improve my geothermal system (for cooling purposes). So watching this is certainly interesting.
Hes doing what we can only do in minecraft
How am I only just now realising he started this in 2019!?!?
Diglett :)
You freaking crack me up colin
Best advert section ever
Was he sued by his neighbours? Because usually everything he did in or around his house was kind of noisy. Just guessing. I already thought: His poor neighbours :)
Next thing is gonna be a 2ed work shop underground 😆 who knows only this mad genius
Nice excuse to upgrade the shop.
oh my god, the part with the cereal gets me everytime
Boris should get him as head of engineering and development
6:09 that’s what she said
I'd do this but I'd have to rebury all the bodies and that'd b so much energy
Is that legal
interesting video but idiotic music
Just went back through and it looks like maybe Staircase Treadmill is where we start seeing the signs.
He is building my dream wtf
Are there not rules about digging down next to other structures? Does the limestone make it okay? Can’t see council signing off on this... unless he bought next door. Lol.
Two lovers forbidden from one another, a war divides their people. And a mountain divides them apart. Build a path to be together. SECRET TUNNEL, SECRET TUNNEL THROUGH THE MOUNTAIN SECRET SECRET SECRET SECRET TUNNEL!
Colin Furze. UK s "Doc brown" Or one man A team - the  F team... So, Mr Furze.  As you're sponsored by free trade. Perhaps you could call this whole network of tunnels/bunkers Dragons Den ....?🤔 ..... Why not use an earth auger drill bit.  Instead of the petrol power use an hydraulic motor with your exsisting pump.  Might shift more dirt faster....  And relatively silent... Good stuff.👍
Great work make sure your going the right way or you will end up in Holland 🇳🇱😜👍
put sound proofing foam on the door and floor above it will block some of noise is u have to use proper tools
Love how one of the tags is Minecraft lmao
If you need a place to put all of that soil, you could just dig a big hole in your yard that you could dump it in.
i appricieat effort to make funny content to watch ad;)_
I'm a 41yo happily married man of 21 years but God I wish he was my wife LOL. Keep up the good work Colin lad your builds are next level sh1t mate.
I love this guy
It's not a secret if you tell 11 million subscribers what you are doing. I love it - keep it up ;)
Most diamonds are on Y11, just a reminder
I only have one question...  how can he dig in a buttoned up shirt and tie?  That must be uncomfortable as hell.
Imagine the rozzers finding that after a sweep of your house that would be a long explanation
This is awesome.
why didn't you just buy a small spade and shovel?
Got me and my girlfriend hooked on this. Definitely want to do this in our future home hoping I have the planning permission 😂.
Not that secret anymore …
Türkçe yorum arayan tek ben miyim?
When are we getting a treehouse Colin
Great movie btw
So when are you going to have your own tool brand  I think a anvil with your logo would be awsome
COLIN!!! JUST MAKE A SIGN THAT SAYS " JACKHAMMER REPAIR"!  That might throw them off! Lol
This is gunna be SOOO much digging lol.
Geez, why not just hire some Mexicans to do the hard work?
Wouldn't it be funny to find out he was evicted from his home, along with his neighbors, due to foundation issues on his street because of this haha!
Careful u might hit bedroxk
Saw a video of some guy who made an artificial sun (DIY Perks) a while ago. If you had one of them wired to a daylight sensor on the surface you could probably get some nice natural looking lighting down in the bunker.
Anyone else ever read that book Tunnels?
Just use a big kompressor with a hoose on it and konekt it to a speere (a pipe) and shove it in there. Reead rhat like a swedish person tried to wright in english.
How is the tunnel secret now that we all know?
*local council finally watching one of these videos* : Wait....did we give him.permission to do any of this?"
Lesson early gang
this is so freaking cool hahaha i cant wait for all your future videos
I think every man dreamed of doing something like this when they were a boy, Colins just gone and done it. Absolutely spectacular, so much hard work. I haven't been this excited for a youtube series in such a long time
I wish so much I could bring my Demo hammer and shovel tip to help. The pond is quite the swim though
"secret" (400.000 views and counting)
11:18 whould have been perfect for a ,,silence of the lambs,, lotion scene joke.
Secret as in only around half a million people know about it.
Have you checked utilities/drainage drawings? Might also be a good idea to test the air down there as there could be ground gases. Would be cool if you talked over how you've made it a safe (not that I'm going to do it myself) 😂
El chapo would be proud!
The madman's doin it! haha!
Boogaloo boys coming to get some tips
When Colin sells his house the premises are just going to be full of boobytraps
you should build a secret slide from inside your house into it
1) The great escape homage was great 2) As a viking descendent i approve of that pub 3) i recently dug 2-3m^3 of rocky clay.. That shit is unbelievably hard work
I would love to see how much a house like that would sell for, like with a bunker and tunnels.... What is this!? Rambo last blood? XD
@9:24 you literally hit rock bottom
Hey I was (almost) right about 'The Great Escape' method of soil disposal.... but the old supermarket switcheroo is much more ingenious. Also, am I the only one to have noticed 'The Ladykillers' band practice gag...?!
oi do you have a license for that tunnel mate?
do you not have a wheelbarrow? gotta be better than tubs
Eh fuck it I'll subscribe
At frist, I saw this guy made a bunker,  I say : This man is a nuttshell  But now after the pandemic, I'll take back my word and plan digging my own appocalypse bunker,  now is just kind of flu pandemic, but maybe tommorrow is Zombies appocalypse, I mean, Who realy know what on the vacine rights 😅
sponsor: ight so what is it that you ding exactly?  Colin: I dig hole   sponsore:... is it like a super cool hole or is there anythng that will make people watch this?  Coling: itc in the ground... in me shed
Just a thought could you not use a Cork screw like drill ?
Tunnel
I'd buy his house
You need a tunnel digging machine
But when you go sideways wont the air get bad no?
*El Chappo wants to know your location.*
Cautious about neighbors but post on the internet for millions
How do you get planning permission for a project like this lol 😂
I've been waiting for this!
Just so you know. I am more than happy to sacrifice my capitol. Please take it.
Him “this is gonna make alot of noise” like he wants to keep it hidden. also him *uploads it to the most used platform*
where was the draft coming from
Even though i was told not to skip the ads I eventually skip and I'm not the only one skipping it.. 😂
I was waiting for a Great Escape reference, I was not disappointed.
Why not just keep playing music and resume working during lockdown lol he obviously ran into permit issues or something and they just got approved
Once you have it built nobody will here or see what you do👍🏼🤟🏼🤟🏼
Barman wants help.
What you Need Colin is a light railway to transport all that crap away.
This man had to be the best dad,or uncle in the world ohmygosh
When you take minecraft too seriously...
You got a license for that m8??????
The vocalist of the "The rival" band has a unmistakable voice
Think I'll keep investing in silver. Been looking for more silver Half Crown coins though, they make awesome looking rings.(completely off topic, I know)😁
This project is insane and as always the furzey ingenuity is the best part. Making his own hydraulic drill, mechanical winch, mine shafts, all for the hell of it
Where did he get #minecraft?
I didn't know you play minecraft
When you come to sell that house, people are going to be blown away XD
Brilliant !
One day, we're all gonna be sitting down with our grand children and tell them about this one crazy British guy who used to build crazy stuff like a hulk smasher and an underground bunker.
he do be buildin a tunnel doe
This fucking madman, i love him
To quote that one musician, ahem. “SECRET TUNNEL! SECRET TUNNEL!”
So you made a hydraulic clay kicker so you could made your tunnel like the clay kickers did on the western front in world war 1 good on you 👍👍👍
Make sure to bring some torches, you don't want any creepers to spawn.
I'm just imagining an estate agent in 2121 showing a young couple around Colin's house :')  "And if you'll follow me through here, this is the secret tunnel leading to the underground bunker in the back garden."
He building the secret dextor laboratory
whats the point of being quiet when you have 11M subs..? anyway this reminds me of a real life batcave for some reason.. kinda looks like the elevator they take down with alfred in the first movie while the mansion is burning
I used to dream of doing this sort of stuff as a kid.
I hadn't seen Colin's videos in quite a while, next thing I know Colin became el chapo.
This is my childhood and manhood dream 🤣 (disclaimer, not referring to Collins ‘sock’ manhood)
You going to shot creat the walls/ceiling?
"Secret"
He’s gonna be so jacked after this...
I like how this video has the #minecraft tag
So is it just me or every one wondering where that hole goes
colins house has to be worth millions with after all these secret tunnels and bunkers have been installed
Colin, any news regarding the crack ? We need to know if there is anything behind it !!
is it the neighbors complaining or you being polite?
I just want someone to look at me the same as that Henry looks at Colin
Holy crap... a year and 3 months. I'd say you are a generous and considerate neighbor, despite have the energy of an erupting volcano with excitement. I would've just continued after about 3 months. Colin has good virtues
Hey Colin I live few houses from you if you don't mind I would love to stop by for a tour you are one of my top favorite YouTubers a d the fact I live right by you makes it very exciting
8:35 No safety tie Colin?  😧
This is very cool
11mill subs Colin Congratulations 😱👍 I can't wait for this project to be completed but the fun is in actually doing it 💪
This man is living my dream lol
About time he got a netherite shovel, with efficiency 5
You should build a tunnel boring machine.
Is this illegal or something? Why not pay your neighbors a visit explain what's going on and see if they are ok with the noise I'm sure they're used to your weird stuff by now
Minecraft made digging sounds easier
Like how he put #minecraft
I would do anything to have a pint with this dude!  Great work mate!
Colin Do not waste time, you only have to hire the 2 guys from the YouTube channel Primitive technology for 3 day's and they will make you the catacombs you want with only sticks and stones and a little of chop, chop, chop ⛏️⛏️⛏️ ... 😂
Is this legal to do? Also i hope he contacted an engineer to follow this project
I hope you don't find any bodies. 😂
I am confused about the sound issue? I can’t hear someone digging in the yard next door on the surface, how would someone hear you 6+ feet underground
If this is a secret project, putting it online on youtube kinda ruins it doesn't it?
Basically lives in Minecraft!
minecraft players be like: yeah so i just landscaped a little thats why i have so much dirt :)
Planning office must be like what the fuck
3:31 Just noticed that he looks like Ewan McGregor
Should build a safe room for your wife to hide from your insanity down there. Keep up the good work!
Where's Saddam Hussein
awesome 👍🤪
Anyone seen Mrs Furze lately ?
That dirt hiding scene tho. Why not just tell us you’re being sponsored by Kellogg’s Colin? LoL!
How can I download freetrade when im 11 yrs old!😆
ya need to put a drill on one of those hydraulic motors. Ya know, like the ones used for rotary well drillen
Sooooo much fun. Can’t wait for part 3
Colin: digging secret tunnel  Also Colin: uploads it to YouTube for millions to see
with the mesh it looks like a mine
i'm surprised you didn't use a plum line to help keep the walls straight
you know you can buy short shovels? lol
Sir Alec Guiness From the lady killers film or Tom Hanks from the remake would have been proud of your band practice.
WOOOOO BEST AND FUNNIEST PERSON ON YT
Are you seriously just going to show that crack and not investigate where it leads?
Elevator
I would love to be a fly on the wall when the neighbours see this stuff.
I wish I owned my own house because my back yard would be nothing but bunkers and tunnels
I’m guessing Colin has had complaints from the neighbours in the past… can’t think why?!
Do you need planning permission to build UNDER your land? Lol..
This guy has clearly lost it but the dedication deserves a sub 😂 curious to see the end result!
This guy is playing Minecraft in real life.
Israeli Government wants to know your location...
is this legal
It rubs the lotion on its skin….
Did I just watch 14 minutes of a guy digging a hole? Yes, yes I did. And I enjoyed every second of it.
Colin, you should have built a TBM (tunnel boring machine) ;-)
You madman
Me and my mate did something like this years ago in our building den’s phase of growing up, we built it out of old pallets and had car battery’s to light it but it got so big we hand to dig down, now mind at the time this was when I was 13/14 yrs old so no hydraulics or common sense, dug down 5ft with only a small shovel and old 10ltr paint tubs, this was done every night after school for 3 months for a heavy rain fall to flood it and turn it into a indoor swimming pool that you could do more damage to your health than swimming in a septic tank 😂😂. Moral of the storey boys will be boys and we never grow up 😂😂
i love your accent ngl
This keeps getting better and better! Can't wait to see whats next
Man id love this, no rock here just sand.
does anyone know roughly how deep the maximum depth of the tunnel is? (preferably metric measurements please).
jesus its just compact clay all the way down
0:10 its not secret anymore
It would be a love/hate relationship with Colin cause you get to see what he’s working on but you have loud noises and a man child scrimg
I’m watching all the way mate.  Great videos, love your bunker project, and loving these tunnel digs.  Keep up the great work Colin!  👍👍👍👍👍👍👍 PS… anyway I can get money to you for loads of beers, you deserve them mate? or to support your channel?
Not very secret if it’s on YouTube 😂😂😂
Anyone else getting silence of the lambs vibe when furze was down the bottom with his mate up top with the hoist
Hashtag Planning Permission
I whish I had the ability to do some of the things you do. You’re kind of like an engineer superhero you just do whatever you want and it’s awesome.
The fing about "secret" is nobody knows abart it. And once you mention it, it's no longer a bleedin' Secret, is it? Cos tinternet or wotevva. . .    😀
(El Chapo wants to:) *know your location
This is what what I felt like as a kid at the beach with my bucket and spade.
El chapo 2.0
Why is no one talking about the air movement and where that led to? Im curious, was that some small cavern/ crevice? Did you find where it lead to?
When can we expect the next video to be out?
This man is crazy
Love the Great Escape clip!
Nice looks really cool!! I'm trying to dig a tunnel in my backyard but it's not even close to as cool as this one!😂
I'm sad he's getting older.
if the walking dead was real colin would be  the  only  british survivor
Part of me would be terrified to discover that crack, part of me would want to pump pressurized water through it to see it if a little geyser popped up somewhere nearby.
You bring joy to the lives of many!
dude marks my word theres goona have a apocalypse and colinfurze its the only one surviving
Colin wheres the jet powered shovel?
"Oi mate, do ya have a diggin' loicence?"
Did you seriously put a Minecraft tag on ur vid mate? XD
Any real estate agents in the UK care to explain what happens if he ever sells this property?
When Minecraft on hardcore gets too easy
beautifull
that band practice looks like too of the weirdest mafiosi burying a body ^^'
i seriously doubt anyone was worried about you digging a hole. just sayin.
This is excellent Colin, Like all the others you do isn't... WTF! I cannot wait to watch this to completion. :-)
"Secret tunnel" *Posts videos of it to youtube*
So do you not need permits from the township where you are to do all this stuff?
I would love to do this in my back garden but at 2.5 meters you would have a water feature.
12:18 is the perfect music for the Die Machine loading screen in zombies.
Digging with the tie on looked really professional
Im curious if you needed to submit plans for this?  I would think anything more than a few ft down would need approval as you run the risk of encountering services.  Also what was that air gap you found?
secret tunnel and announces it to millions
Skip sponsorchip to 6:05
My Capitol is at risk?!?!
This needs an elevator, one like those delivery elevators für restaurants in the middle of the walkway.
<== retired boring and tunneling specialist...  not a bad few days of handwork and it only took a year and a half... cutting down the shovel & spade was a very good idea. rather than a ram, you need an auger for that clay/limestone.  soon as you start horizontal you will want a muck plate on the floor makes it much easier to shovel up the swarf.
I dig Colin's projects!
Secret tunnel, secret tunnel through the backyard, secret secret secret secret tunnel!
wow
how does this channel not have more subscribers than mr beast or the guy that wears make up??
How does planning permission work for secret underground tunnels? Also you might want to add some support that mesh and steel frame work with some safety ties!
Colin you might get an air vent
Secret tuneeeeeeel
the cartels are watching this planning to break out el chapo, AGAIN
I realy like the black Outfit :D
There we go, there’s a hole in the ground.
CO2 sinks, be sure to get some ventilation
9:34 Colin finally has hit rock bottom
But where did the crack go?
pablo escabar
what's the point in a secret tunnel if you document every part of it on youtube? it isn't much of a secret.
The absolute epicness of this is beautiful
fumbling in your jeans in the park is possibly not a good idea mate..........post it all to downing st.
hello my friend, you are doing great work. I would be glad if you examine my youtube channel too.😊
When’s the next video
This is so awesome!
Surprised the neighbors would hear anything with him being that far down underground to be honest.
I remember a time when Collin said that was a long project building the bunker , I believe when this is finish is going to be an old man.
Colin, you need a continuity person at 2:10! 😀
Salute to Vietcong tunnel rats.
Not a bad deal. Getting paid to increase the value of your house.
The giant wrench keeps moving in the background
colin when you sell your house you need to leave a collection of videos for the new owners
Building Control everywhere else: Conservatories and garage extensions.  Building Control in Colin's Area: An underground tunnel connecting your underground bunker to your home workshop and your house??
You know while this project is stalled you COULD soundproof that shed and it would help with the noise lol BTW don't you need like some kind of approval from the local government to do stuff like this to make sure you don't get too close to any waterlines etc.? I'd imagine if you dug to close to a waterline and it ruptures it'll flood the whole thing lol
How is this secret? You just told 11M people about it. 🤔
I think it was Leonardo who used a set of mirrors to connect holes with a straight tunnel... will you be doing that?
ohhh yea i cant wait to see this completed damm what a project
I wish I had 10% of the energy Colin has!
I really thought you would just add a conveyor belt to take all the rubbish to skip on the road or driveway
Bit disappointed... I was expecting a V8, flying, flamethrowing, psycho digger.... Awesome build tho
There's only one thing to say here.....  Brothers of the mine rejoice! Swing, swing, swing with me Raise your pick and raise your voice! Sing, sing, sing with me Down and down into the deep Who knows what we'll find beneath? Diamonds, rubies, gold and more Hidden in the mountain store  Born underground, suckled from a teat of stone Raised in the dark, the safety of our mountain home Skin made of iron, steel in our bones To dig and dig makes us free Come on brothers sing with me!  I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole Diggy, diggy hole, diggy, diggy hole I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole Diggy, diggy hole, digging a hole  The sunlight will not reach this low Deep, deep in the mine Never seen the blue moon glow Dwarves won't fly so high Fill a glass and down some mead! Stuff your bellies at the feast!…    Born underground, grown inside a rocky womb The earth is our cradle; the mountain shall become our tomb Face us on the battlefield; you will meet your doom We do not fear what lies beneath We can never dig too deep  I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole Diggy, diggy hole, diggy, diggy hole I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole Diggy, diggy hole, digging a hole I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole Diggy, diggy hole, diggy, diggy hole I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole Diggy, diggy hole, digging a hole  Born underground, suckled from a teat of stone Raised in the dark, the safety of our mountain home Skin made of iron, steel in our bones To dig and dig makes us free Come on brothers sing with me! I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole
Hes soo kind, i mean he got 11 milion followers and still care for his neighbours. Hes so groundend respect
I don't know what's more entertaining, the project, or Colin's antics.
That small hole in the beginning would be a great place to hide your copious amounts of drug money that I know you have :))
The question isn't why am I watching a man Digging a hole, the question is why this is so interesting
this man could be running a secret underground base prducing anything he wants whether its guns, bombs, drugs. and everyone would be none the wiser
6:06 to skip ad :)
Never change Collin never change
Ummmm. It’s not a secret anymore. 👀
oh cool
There's just no way around the fact that this is one of the very best channels on YouTube. And not just for the music.
Several weeks of diging and still no diamond pickaxe ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
what happened to the crack where the draft was coming from?
This reminds me of a movie
Clay can be sold, or Colin could build a potters wheel and a kiln.
This mans really out here playing Minecraft IRL
Real life Minecraft 😀
Can't wait for the next one Colin
Just collab with Mr Tfue
I swear this man is looking out for El Chapo.
This type of can do is why the U.S sided with The British in the great wars and the whole speaking the same language.
Cool but how about a wheel barrow rather than lugging heavy buckets of dirt?
a breaking bad meth lab
During apocalypse you can take shelter there. Soon after 2 years you will definitely need it.👍
Man preps for doomsday, and unlike everyone else, is applauded and revered
Awesome work Colin.
😍 This is such an awesome protect Colin
Wouldn’t a small gas auger and post hole diggers to remove the spoils been easier and faster?
Call Time Team. They'll find a Roman villa under the shed.
White shoes in a dirt hole lmao
Haha awesome!
Crikey you’ve come so far!! Can’t wait to see the outcome
I can't wait!!
You could burn down the shed and in a few years still find more Christmas tree...
SIDE WALL PROTECTION !!!
Why don't you insulate and shut the hatch to minimize noise? And add some kind of sensor to monitor the oxygen level...
what next , a concrete pillbox?
The great escape reference made it 1000% better
I live in the US and one of your big piles of earth has appeared in my neighbor's yard.
Monetizing digging a hole. The sad part is that if everyone was living a full life watching someone live one wouldn't be so special.
I wonder if Colin Gona make a secret lift to tunnel,🤔🤔
someday someone is gonna buy that house move in and think who the hell is this guy
If we are ever sentenced to life imprisonment at ADX Florence, I hope our cells are side by side. We may never get out, but it would certainly be entertaining.
Is it just me or does the pit have great acoustics?
Not such a secret tunnel when hundreds of thousands of people know about it
And some idiots saying that houses in Resident Evil unrealistic with their weird contraptions, secret rooms and tunnels.
CCM (Colin cave man)
"whats that sound?" "Sounds like a trumpet down a 20 ft hole....weird."
It's not a SECRET tunnel anymore, since in 2 hours you got 381K people who know your secret...
Minecraft players:   Look what they need to mimic a fraction of our power!
I think I'm more interested in the potential cave system you found now.
2:02 "Why he's not wearing a mask", I think. Then i realized it's 2018
Been watching Collinfurze since he was a tiny channel. The things he's done are amazing. Some of the only channels who has left their personality and theme which got.them famous totally intact. Its awesome to watch. Can't wait to see this project done
make a convayerbelt for the dirt
Why do you want to make the tunnel in secret?
Wasn't that pump under the table in a erlyer video when you made the hydraulic press or did you take it back out and just reinstall it
You madman! I had no idea you've been digging that long! More (quiet) power to you....
Minecraft irl
Suprised he didn’t build his own Mini TBM
U da man Furze.
Love watching colin think through a d iui situation and enjoy it. Loved the vid cant wait for the next
did you need planning permission for this? haha
He puts the lotion in the basket, or he gets the hose again! Lol!
Hey, the draft! Was there a supervillain cave by a Furze of forgotten history, remains of monastery robbed clean by vikings or what?
Are you prepearing for Russian invasion or something? xD
The cave sir I must know more about the cave!!!
did he need like special permits for this
you should make a air gliding lil home
You should really try a hand auger or maybe make some hydraulic auger for digging
absolutely loving the quality of these recent videos! we recognize your efforts mr furze!! great vid as always!
Just finished watching it, and now I'm watching it again 🤣🤣 Colin for PM
This would have been a great opportunity to build a conveyor to get that dirt directly to a truck.
In germany we would ask:"Hat der eine Baugenehmigung?"
E
there are two kinds of people in this world. those who have dug a hole and those who have not. this took an extraordinary amount of effort
Would be mental if he stumbles across some ancient artifacts
For your 12th million subscriber fireworks project, you can blast a new underground room!
I use to which you when you had 3 million subs  ut could not sub but I made sure to sub now
Middle of September? How old is this video? 11:40
Diggs a tunnel attempting to interconnect shed and bunker. Accidentally diggs the wrong way and ends up inside Her Majestie’s vault. Oh well, might as well take a few gold bars since we’re here anyway 🤷‍♂️
Not much of a secret
man i wish i could do something like this at my place but i hit water only 3 ft below ground level.
Colin has been single handed keeping cocaine smugglers in business for years!
Middle of September now.....!!!!!!
Gotta sing that secret tunnel song t
Steve Mc Queen was proud of you👍
hi Colin, I want if you could make a video where you talk about how much you spent on all of your projects.  You are so lucky That you have 1.5 meters of dirt. There where I live we have at least 15 cm of dirt min.
My dream when i was 6.
Colin furze the master of digging pits
Just soundproof the entrance
Tom Lamb, worra star. Colin Furze, worra nutter.
Alternative title: *"How to Play Minecraft"*
Colin digs a hole under a shed and spends as much money as possible on making new tools and littering tickets.
When you took minecraft serouslly
You need to start using ear protection when using things like jack hammers and such, you seem to ignore safety requirements for saving your hearing.
There is a tool to dig posts in to the ground where u don't need a lot of space
Where's the jet powered shovel when you need it
is this guy CRAZY or whaT? ..dont DIG your own TUNNEl youll END UP DIGGIN your OWN GRAVE !! when it collapses over you ..
im surprised the government or another agency has not employed you yet 🤔
Dude, you need a health and safety manager
Colin is the reason we have Building Codes.
➡️BREAKING NEWS⬅️  "El Chapos' secret engineer found alive living in the U.K....details Tonight at 6:00"🤭👍
Irl minecraft
Do you need any planning permission to build tunnels?
Colin: "I don't want to disturb my neighbors while I'm building a tunnel in my yard."  My neighbors: "CAR STEREO GO BRRRRRRRRR"
TUNNEL YEAAAAAH
Very hard dirt. One would think of using shoring....
Your neighborhood code officer must love you.
When he said he felt a draft, I thought he hit a gas pipe 😂 maybe it was natural gas!!
Colin, you have to enchant your pickaxe to dig faster
I even watch the ad of the sponsor cause its that entertaining 😂
I love the fact that you are a perfect combination of Charlie Bucket and Willy Wonka and it makes me want to grow up to be like you 😂
This dude is insane (in a good possible way to be insane) :-)
I was getting so nervous about collapse once you got to like 6 feet deep! I'm glad the framework and mesh followed soon after!
This has my interest after just finishing 'El Chapo' on Netflix :P
Soil drill is easy. It need something anchor to use sideways.
As an OSHA certified construction engineer, that scares the shit out of me.  You should never EVER get in an un reinforced hole past your waist because a cave in could crush you instantly.  And that reinforcement he put in at the end looks like it should be stronger than 1-2” square round bar but i’ll give him the benefit of the doubt
Would you need planning permission to build a tunnel?
Sing it with me: "Two lovers, forbidden from one another A war divides their people And a mountain divides them apart Built a path to be together  ...Yeah, and I forget the next couple of lines, but then it goes...  Secret tunnel! Secret tunnel! Through the mountain! Secret, secret, secret, secret tunnel! Yeah!"
Asking for a friend but do you need planning permission to do this ..
Jesus if your digging a hole that’s a hole nice work Mr Colin
Best I idea ver
When Colin can’t get planning permission… 🛠🤐
Is it really a secret tunnel if you post it on youtube??
Very secret entrance
Neat project. I'm not sure if you can call this a secret tunnel tho.
"this item isn't available in your country"  sadness
almost as fast as mine craft!
diz nikkka playinkkk minecraffff yoioooyorteoskutdjxdhf
Prospective buyer: "Sooo, there's a hidden tunnel underneath the whole property, running between the main structure, the tool shed, and a hidden underground bunker?"  Realtor: "Yeah, the previous owner was one of those... YouTuber types."
One day decades from now, some houseshoppers are in for alot of surprises :D
Whats the name of the music at 12:17?
Love it keep up the good work
We all know the real reason Colin is doing it in secret is because he does not have the planning permission and is hiding from the government
Minecraft 😂
woah, this is amazing
Surprised you didn't make a hydraulic augur, your own mini TBM ;)
when making this tunnel how many times did you think: What did I get myself into?! shi....
wait what!? you didn't install a conveyor belt to get the soil out? how disappointing?!
Bunker for what ? World war 3 ? 🤔
I always wonder about the people that move into that house after him. If they're paying attention, they're going to happen across all kinds of amazing things.
Where is part 3? 🤣🤣🤣 Cant wait for The next episode
Don't know why you haven't built a home tunneling machine.
Reckon Colins had a noise complaint ?? Or neighbours hate him lol???
pablo escobar reincarnated?
Before anyone does this, make sure you call your utility companies and check for lines, especially gas lines! Most places don't charge for this! Also, get proper structural walls in place, people have died digging and the walls caving in on them.
Why don't you make an auger
Omg what a secret but can I know your secret?
Minecraft irl
Colin: "I don't want the neighbours to know about the tunnel" posts video to YouTube
This man is the definition of work smarter not harder 😂
I expected a convayer to move all that dirt outside lol
So good.  So very very good
I can’t help but wonder, is this legal?
Colin: needs to be quiet  Also colin: big pump thingy
in germany we call that: Servus, haben sie auch eine Baugenehmigung?
Добавьте русский
The sponsor section sounds particularly funny at 2x speed.
You need some dynamite
2:16 .... That “ NOTE “ !!!!! Lol 😂
That mesh is no where near strong enough to provide any protection from the side walls deciding to bulge inwards. The steel frame is also not much use. Maybe 100mm square thick wall steel frame and multiple layers of mesh. This will enable you to see bulging which solid plate would not. Do you know where the water table is? Are you going to be able to get out fast if need be? Does the airflow come from a broken sewer anywhere and will it carry in noxious gasses?
I hope you checked the city plans for old pipings, etc.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Is it difficult to get a building permit for something like this? Asking for a friend
What i dont understand is how he does all of this with a suit on
What an absolute legend lol. You are mad colin but a bloody clever bloke. God be careful down there. And goodluck with it all mate 👍 can't wait for the next video.
In India if you dig holes like that , you will start seeing snakes and other creatures lol
loving the tunnel dig, but cant help but feel there was a Furzomatic Tunnel Digger 3000 which would have made light work of it...
You know you could sell it as fill dirt. Surely you have contractor contacts.
It's probably gonna be packed with people during rush hour too.
https://youtu.be/k28OXKi3jrA
This is my childhood dream
You really need a health warning so ppl don't just jump into digging their own holes to create a tunnel etc, only to then have the ground collapsing in on themselves etc  other then that cool idea, I'd love to hear what your wife thinks lol & your neighbours
try a digging fork . it's lighter , digs better and is far easier .
Anything you Find while Digging?🧐
Build a small dozer controlled by a remote which can fit in a cave/ tunnel
Hows its a secret colin .  If u have exposed it on YouTube.. everone knows about it
This is awesome. I want to know more about the Crack. I would've followed it...
Vertical Shaft Boring Machine Build-Off
Cartels are going to be calling you soon with offers you can't refuse.  Since the El Chapo is now in jail, someone else has to help them build tunnels.
my man be finding diamonds in a week
Imagine falling into a sinkhole and it ends up being exactly like this
the GOAT of you tubers
U need a better shovel mate. This one ought to get the job done in a day: https://youtu.be/6ryyAenmzHM
You should, just for the fun of it, make this hole like 10 or 12 meters deep and build a secondary, smaller bunker down there
My capitol is at risk!? Why didn't you tell me this at the start of January??
Can you imagine the advertisement of this house if Colin ever sells it?!
In Parts-3-5 Colin bodges together a proper TBM!
Tries to keep tunnel secret. Next day: Releases video showing his tunnel to millions of people.. What a logical move :)
Pov : 11:38
12:03 10 yr old goes to the mines for another 18 hour work day in 1819, colorized
I wonder when you will fall into the lava.
Your new Video is a really nice Birthday Present for me 😊  Thanks a lot 😊
surely you needed to get permission from planning to build this? i would loved to have been a fly on the wall in that conversation hahahaha
Digging in a Minecraft 2x2 tunnel be like
I would expect a walking band system for soil.
Why does this have Minecraft as one of the video tags lol
Its not really a secret now
just as a bit of warning, make sure you’ve got a Radon detector while you’re down there. You don’t want to breathe that stuff in when you’re digging.
Reminds me of the Indians making a temple I’d watch at 3 AM
No one air trust. I feel robbed. At least I saw a different colour tie. That was exciting! :-)
#minecraft? really?
I can’t think of anything MORE suspicious than Colin in his shed being quiet…
WHAT'S WITH MEN AND LIKING DIGGING HOLES AND BURROWING IN SECRET TUNNELS
Colin you are absolutely  brilliant, well done  pal.
Colin is creating an El Chapo tunnel for his escape plan. ⛏️🤠🌮🇲🇽
Looks like you’ll be set to survive the nuclear fallout haha
Mega
colin is the beach hut is still there if so can u do a revisit pls 🙏🙏
Damn i just saw the first video of this yesterday lololol talk about perfect timing!   Also I'm jealous you get to do all this cool shit 😂
Colin, I recommend you to use the workwear from engelbert strauss because they are at a very high quality standard and literally made for you and your projects. They are not really expensive and they are very useful. LG Konrad
Collin you could have made a Mini Tunnel Boring Machine
You need a dirt vac system...would work a lot better...don't know about quieter though.
Seriously good stuff this 👏 love it 😀
TBH I'm half expecting one of these videos to include him finding unexploded ordinance from the war.
Why you didn't call Team Rocket for digging?
You need to support the walls much more than that. People have killed themselves by digging shallow holes and under estimating their ability to get out. Be careful buddy or we will be giving you a Darwin award
Colin “el chapo” Furze
I hope he takes into account water and flooding, as well as potential foundation issues...
wheelbarrow?
Is this legal? Im asking because I wanted to do this and always got told by other people that it would be illegal? Maaaan, I want a tunnel system and a man cave :-/
Tou should add a secret elevator like  a villian
PLEASE UPLOAD MORE I'M SO HYPED FOR THIS
You’ve heard of mad scientist, now get ready for—

“Secret tunnel” posted on YouTube with over 11m watching 😂
Man, you're insane. And I love every single part of it.
Dude, you should have totally build a  Conveyor belt to transport the dirt and stone to the other side of the yard.
next news headline, colin furze arrested for growing weed in an underground bunker lol
Funny how normal Youtubers cry about how hard it is to cut a 1H Video.  Collin stuffed 1 Year and 3 Months in a 14 Min Video....
Building a secret tunnel and upload a full documentary about it on You Tube. Well that works out.
Mom why does my cereal taste like dirt.
Is this even legal to do???
Terraria be like
I'd like to think that Colin's neighbours have their own YouTube channel on DIY underground acoustics to spy on tunnelling Furzes 😅
You continue to me my most favorite YouTube(r) discovery.
I enjoyed this so much, I didn't even skip the in-video ad section...
you should colab with "Stuff Made Here"
ok.. sounds like you running out of ideas.. shame
'I am a dwarf, and I digging a hole'-that I supposed to hear
My favorite youtuber is digging a hole get i. There furz
Finding that draft, my first thought was "well well well! looks like some neighbor beat you to this idea!" alternately "old Nazi sapper tunnels?!"
wouldnt it be safer to pour concrete on the walls so em are actually solid?
Why you use water though?
I've been waiting for this
u like someone 🤔. whom i have never seen 😳
DON'T DIG STRAIGHT DOWN! You'll fall into lava :>
Let's keep it secret, and post it on the internet
Stramford
I worked for a while as a landscaper. Colin has an entire suburb around him now. Many suburbs had a whole load of noise restriction laws that made us have to use electric equipment so the company didn't get fined. What are the odds that Colin's suburb is sick of his antics and imposed noise restrictions on him?
A build within a build... this is getting to some Inception levels of Furzing!
This just keeps getting better.  Been a while since I've smiled ear-to-ear over a project!  What a project!
Not so secret now 😂
This isn't legal... Is it? Also, how does he know where utilities are? It would be a bummer to hit a sewage pipe.
real life minecraft
Are you going to reinforce the entrance?
This is crazy fun to watch
Is this legal as well? Seems like a real estate hack haha, loving it
Colin, are you going to build rotary tunnel drilling machine?
naughty project.
also why didn't you just buy a trenching tool? you know those military shovels ?
Why no wheel barrow?
he should make one of those moving carpets that you always see in airports
He literally find a minecraft ravine kkkkkkkkk
I have a Capitol that is at risk? 🤔
ayo make me one of these from my room to the kitchen plz
Mate, that aint secret no more
Hi
Kopanie takiej pierdolnej dziury to dla mnie cos gorszego niz pieklo XD
Secret tunnel secret tunnel song lyrics
To get rid of the soil, why not dig a big hole in your garden and put it in there.
I have no clue why, but this video reminds me of the song Diggy Diggy Hole
So, since this is in the UK, what would happen if during the excavation of the bunker or the tunnel you had discovered an archeologically significant artefact or building ruin? Like, you dig down and discover a Roman mosaic?
Quite honestly My favorite part is seeing your tools evolve. Like the crane getting a hook specifically designed to carry the dirt up in those baskets.
Bro its harder than its looks amd colinfurze just did it i Can't even thing about this give a heart bro big fan from India
Build me a compound! fuckn amazing!
might be all fine and dandy for you to do that by hand but here we have a thick clay undersoil which is a %$$^&^ to dig thru.
my back hurts just watching this video
I can't wait for Part 3 when Colin discovers a slumbering Dragon beneath his house and wakes it up, bringing the Dragon Apocalypse upon the world.
I won't lie  If the internet gave me 11m subscribers I too would invest in a secret bunker/ tunnel network
Colin, way kewl!!! Are you aligning the tunnel with laser? How do you plan to optimize orientation to tunnel exit? Are you going to line the tunnel with concrete?
Ah-MY-zing!  This bloke is ah-MY-zing!!!
I'm a the only one that thinks every house should have these elements that Colin creates?
Colin is basically just playing minecraft in real life at this stage.
please make a homemade Tunnel Boring Machine :)
To be honest I'd enjoy having colin as my neighbor...there would.never be a dull moment. Plus good honest healthy competition in the crazy shit meter area.
you should go 50 blocks deeper and you wil find diamond
El chapo watching this 👁👄👁
I think his thing about the neighbours not knowing about it is more to avoid a noise complaint
Ah. Hello, fellow 2006'er.
Next week on Colinfurze, Digging a secret missel silo, building a nuke, and outliving everyone else in my diy bunker.
It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.  But the dirt in the fcking basket!
Digs a hole dosent get his white shirt dirty at all
Hang about… is this project that old it was pre workshop hydraulics? 🤔
Мы все одна семья . когда ты срёшь под себя, тогда - нет .
Colin in 2022 be like:today we are making a protection dome made of metal and glass hope u finish by the way 😄😄
Is that even legal to dig that long tunnel in your property?
expecting great content from this. But Colin your turning into a MOLE.... LOL
Im confused, Why would covid affect you buliding this?
YouTube recommendations at 3 am
SECRET TUNNEL SECRET TUNNEL SECRET TUNNEL
Colin out here playing IRL Minecraft
My god man, I would love to see your brand of chaos meeting Martin from Wintergatan
Btw have you thought about adding in an underground pool after you have down the tunnel to compete with those primitive survival guys
Really good way to end up dead.  Do not do this at home.
..... SECRET TUNNNNEEEELS
блэт ну и крэйзи
Suprised he didn't sound proof the shed with all the stuff he does then he could raise hell if he wanted to
Secret tunnel Secret tunnel Through the mountain Secret, secret, secret, secret, secret tunnel
"what were you doing during lockdown?" "on, not much. just dug a tunnel under my backyard"
Me: Hydrolic chisel.... Masterpiece.
Oh Colin... take it from a Para Veteran you need a proper folding entrenching tool! A shovel and pick axe in one. Best of luck!  Love the channel and all your awesomeness! Happy Canada Day 🇨🇦 from across the pond...
When I do hard and dirty work, I always put on my tie first:)
Fabricate up spade like tooth for the hydraulic ram, that wedge works good but I feel like you would benefit alot more using a bigger tip, been watching alot of them Gold Hunting series lately and they use jack hammers which shovel attachments which seem to crave the soil really well, anything like these would be perfect.  https://images.app.goo.gl/BmVJumWspTCSe4jh6  Also maybe a dolly with wheels for the hydraulic pump and if possible a retractable reel would save some space. But the spade attachments defaintly a way to improve your rate 👌🏼
SECRET TUNNEELLLL SECRET TUNNEELLL!!! THROUGH THE GARDEN!!!! SECRET SECRET SECRET SECRET TUNEEELLLLLL YEAH!!!
You got a lot of work ahead: digging is hard work, man!  Love what you do with the dirt though.  Keep the project a secret: don't want any kind of video evidence giving it away......
I digged a hole in my garden for a small pond. I had a pickaxe, shovel and spate like you. Ok normal length. And in the time i needed to make the hole big enough for the plastic pond, i could make a complete mountain disappear in the game Minecraft with bare hands.
You could of sold the sfuff that you dug out of the tunnel . We would of bought it
😲
A small 900 Watt jackhammer is really quite, fast & easy to handle underground . Get better buckets, don't be under them EVER...!!!
This is awesome
Colin being quiet is like a little kid being quiet. you know they're up to something crazy and its best to keep an eye on them.
Paranoid millionaires would love to buy his home
I'd have been mighty disappointed had there been no reference to The Wooden Horse. Jolly good show old bean. 👏 Keep your head down and don't get caught by the goons. We're depending on you. 🇬🇧
I always think about your neighbours watching you videos, you either have really understanding neighbours or you dont give a fuck! Its great 😂
Minecraft rl
You love being underground. Maybe you were a mole in a previous life
There’s no one like Colin Furze
well it's impossible to move now XD
2014 Furze: I built Wolverine claws 2023 Furze: I built an ICBM
*Builds secret tunnel* *Posts the full process on youtube*
💪🏼
1:25 Today is a good day for havoc!
Colin is the Demo ranch of the UK
I found my next project.
He's trying to pull off some El Chapo shit 😂
No turbo powered vacuum cleaner to dig the tunnel?
Did I just watch a man dig a hole for 14 minutes
Mr. Colin, I know you told me not to skip the Freetrade ad, but I tried to download it last time and it's not available in my country. I hope you'll forgive me...
Colin, there's supposed to be a whole network of tunnels on the south side of the town bridge ... maybe you could link up with them? :D
So, should be finished about Summer 2027 then ?. Seriously though its going to be mad when its finished. Will be like having a huge but hidden extension to your house.
Is it still secret if the whole internet knows about it?
Kid: Mom, these cereals taste like dirt ! 🤢🤮 Mom:  😡 Colinnnnnnnnnnnn !!!! You 🤬🤬🤬!
Could i please buy a jar of dirt
4:53 "You Capitol is at risk" - Great, I never liked that thing...
I’ve been waiting all week for this 😅
"Don't skip this bit" I'll always skip irrelevant sponsors. I'm still going to watch the video though.
This guy just does not want to go outside
START DRILLING !!
This has been my idea for a long time I think it can help I wanted to do it but you are at the top of your game And already doing it. I think building a big pressure washer vacuum combination, Would be the best idea for this job. But by now I’m sorry I’m to late you have built the whole thing by now because you do not Post a unsatisfying video. I Love this idea and thank you for making that link accessible I don’t now if I want to Sign up for another investing company I already signed up with Robin Hood so do you have a Venmo?
psssst colin, its not a secret
are the neighbors really that sensitive to noise?
Never dig down. YOU WILL FALL IN LAVA!!!!!
Awesome 😄😄
Never dig straight down Colin. You might end up in lava.
Welpers, I'm going to say it. You finally cracked your nut. LOL that's a really deep out house.
He’s supposed to be an engineer but didn’t even think to use a haste beacon.
His entire property is now part of the shed, this is Colin's final form
When Colin started talking about a draft, and then a crack, did anyone else think "He's about to go through the roof of an undocumented bloody sewer"? :D
i cannot waittttttt
Hiding from neighbors and telling the whole world. But respect you for turning a dream into reality.
I thought I recognised that hydraulic pump install and said "But that was years ag- oh my god"
Pump some coloured *environmentally safe* dye into that crack and try and find where it comes out. Who knows what you could do with that info, emergency escape tunnel maybe?
so cool, greetings from Puerto Rico!
Someones been watching "Money Heist" on netflix !. lol
Now build traps into the walls of the tunnel to stop intruders in their tracks
This bloke has lost the plot, and I'm envious as fack. Where does he get all his money from to finance his wacko world?
if you're still digging, try a shop vac. They're surprisingly effective.
WILD
This so coollllllll
This is what I always dreamed of when I dug holes in my backyard but instead I just got beat
Colin, this is the dopest shit.
Says he needs to be quiet.... shows montage of LOUD
He's the first world youtube connection to those two indian boys who build everything in the bush
My little brother just asked me did you help build batman's cave
Minecraft IRL
Just have the neighborhood move to a 1-mile radius.  XD
Love ya videos furze I’m 16 wish I could do what you do but obviously I’m not half as smart as you but keep it up and I want to se the end of this video plz whenever I watch any of ya vids I crave for part two but this even has a part three got me waiting like donkey from shrek are we there yet bye love the vids keep it up
Wonder how the council will react...!
Did you consider trench support?
I wanna see how the property value of his house went up over the years
Epic!
Will a cordless drill and a auger bit help in that soil
Imagine trying this in germany xD you'd get arrested on the 2nd day because your neighbor is *always* watching (yeah, even when they are away).
Nice legs
Digging a secret tunnel. let's be honest, seriously is it a secret.
I want so badly to see the next video!
You going to render that mesh? Looking good, shame about your noise constraints
Hey Colin, please take a look at another underground workshop/tunnel build in progress by Turbo Conquering Mega Eagle, he doesn't get enough views! https://youtu.be/3XvtcYL6t6g
Lol you should have rented a hand drill
if people dont watch anymore or you want work off grid .you can always get a job by mexican cartel hahah
Whats with the crack now? Where did it led to ?
What was harder to get? Your wife's permission or planning permission.
I've been digging my pool out of rock in my garden, and seeing you try to dig in that small space give me instant flashbacks to my back pain.  If i was you i would have build a large vacuum cleaner to suck all the dirt out, It seems pretty loose. (ps. i always wanted to build one myself from a large garbage container)
I hope that crack isn't natural gas bro. Get your self an air quality meter
Colin is gonna have one hell of a time trying to sell his house one day
Imagine the buyers or the realtor if Colin ever tries to sell his house.
I applaud the consideration you have for your neighbors. The fact you went that extra mile to make somthing quiet speaks volumes about you. Can't wait to see the end :D
The shit Tom has to do like wear a suit while digging a hole just for Colin's video😅
Fking awesome xD I just hope you got an expert close to ensure the tunnel integrity, would be a shame to find out something collapsed on anyone .
so stoked for the next vid
Colin, you missed another dirt disposal chance.  Sell it!  Wasn't there that one YouTuber that sold dirty bath water?  People will buy anything.
HI LEVN
Love his energy ♥️
El Chapo, but brithis and funny.
"secret"
1:57 Stupid question but was this a joke? What did you actually end up doing with the dirt?
if you have 11 mil subscribers and you post a video about a "secret" tunnel, well than it is obviously NOT secret...
This is every dad ever except only the ones who finish their projects.
So now we find out the original reason why Colin's shed has a lot of the things it has. Hidden hydraulics, additional metal bars on the ceiling... all just for the secret underground tunnel he's been digging for _years_ now.
To quote avatar the last air bender: SECRET TUNNEL!!!
It's not very secret if you post it online for millions to see Colin!
If you want to cover up the noise why not record yourself working then just play it on repeat
*BEST QUARANTINE PROJECT*
3:53 Your neighbors hate you.
How has no one made a minecraft reference yet????????
Don’t let the gestapo find it
I wondered why my coco pops taste earthy
Wears a tie while digging! Class miner.
I have to ask what hapin to your hydraul ic system that you put in your workshop 2 years ago.  https://youtu.be/E1dTwm8Lmpc
You should build a elevator for your bunker at your house

Wish colin was my brother.....
best of luck and stay safe, digging is definitely a pretty dangerous thing.
omg if you actually left the cereal box filled with dirt at the store, THATS F-ING HILARIOUS!! LMAOOO
It’s crazy what this man accomplishes because like I’m doing dishes or something then he’s like pfft your doing dishes manually I have a machine that dose them for me
Are you not worried about hitting the water table then when it rains it floods
11:19 dad
4:20 he looks like that colonel or general from Monsters V Aliens
Why don’t you just buy a drill with a spiral end and drill it out
9:30 mate add some shoring before you end up on a BBC story about Stamford mine collapse rescue efforts.
1:26 THE GREAT ESCAPE!!! that’s one of my favorite movies
What about making like a 2 inch wide augur bit that can chuck up to one of the big rotary hammer drills. That way it's electric and fairly quiet
I bet there will be something in the middle but is going to be for him only 0:26
"It rubs the lotion on its skin" also broke the number 1 rule on Minecraft he dug straight down.
Awesome stuff as always !!
Some could cover up gaps between doors and walls by building them with the same wooden cover with wooden lips above the gaps
LOL got to love it.
Colin I have just one thing to say to you T.B.M.
VC bookie explains and builds the Ho Chi Minh tunnels. Laos circa. 1966
Here's a Secret mate this is no more a secret
Fantastic project!! Just get efficiency V on your pickaxe and a haste II beacon lol
Someday somewhere in the future someone will buy this house and find surprise after surprise.
Круто !
Awesome project. Don't know how much noise you have been making but I would hope after going a few feet in the ground that most of it would stay in the ground.
I want one.
What happened to the crack where the draft was coming in? Might want to keep that in check so things don't flood in heavy rain.
This project is where Colin gets buried alive
I paid google 15 bucks this month for no commercials!!! I’m unsubscribing!!!!
Absolute legend
This man just lives the dreams we want to
This guy is preparing for zoombie apocalypse 🤔👌
Dude get something to scoop the dirt out Actually make something to do that
Well I mean you've already done it I reckon but all the motor and hydraulics could be affixed to the crane mechanism you've been using to haul up the dirt if you're able to get another one to do you know the dirt
Every day I inspire to be this man. Remember to drink some water.
Colin…. you are achieving what so many talentless waste of transplantable organs, calling themselves “influencers” fail to achieve…..  I yearn to tunnel under my house, my garden, my business yard and workshops….. 🙂  If you can’t afford more square footage space…. You must go up, which requires many many permission…. or down 🤔  Down is good…. I’m fulfilling my dreams vicariously through your Mole like shenanigans….. 🇬🇧
This is insanity! I love it!
What happened to the windy gap Colin?
Love it already your coolest build, keep up the good work🤫👍🤫
I have a question are uk laws different from us laws in that you have to get a permit to build something? like is it required you get permission or can you do whatever you want with your land?
10:53 well it aint a secret anymore.....
Could try core drilling your way through its relatively quiet and from the look of how you do things you could probably build a rig so you can have multiple drills running at once being pushed forward with hydraulics if one drill is too slow for you
More taxes!
Was waiting for the hydraulic auger to show up, and thought that was going to happen when the pump came out.  I’d figure someone had the hydraulic auger attachment for a skid steer in the group of friends there.  Would have made the dirt digging much faster, solid rock would have been a different story.  And making something to hold it with the force they can generate and easy to move is a slight problem, but maybe on a smaller auger/motor setup not to bad.
This is my dream.
So, next week sponsored by The Boring Company :How to building a TBM....
It's starting to look like the entrance shaft to the Batcave
I want to dig now
Get ready to get recruited by the cartels 😂 his digging skills
At this point you can’t sell this house.
How does he get this planning permission
Loving this Colin, cant wait to see the next video.
Minecraft has been real quiet since then
honestly 4:56 the best ad ive seen atleast wasnt one that i skip but is kinda good like well done mate
I have twin 6 year old boys. I have a feeling this is the kind of thing they dream about. ❤
I love you
"Neighbour waching"  so that is what's going on overthere... he might be under me right now aswell😵.
An auger might be a quiet way to move a lot of dirt. You do have to worry about it getting sucked in though.
Colin started a mining company in his shed.
If he doesnt build a train track in the tunnel im gonna be majorly dissapointed...
Why?
You sick fa... I mean genie..  nice project . I love it .
Wow... So much work.
I love your videos!
now for real what do u think how Secret ur tunnel is :P :D:D:D
SECRET TUNNEL!! SECRET TUNNEL!! THROUGH THE MOUNTAINS!!
Its like the great escape, this! XD  EDIT: 1:27, ahh he actually made the reference too :D
Hands made of leather and a back made of steel!!
What I recomend is ventilation systems and sound proofing for the digging.
Wow you are one extraordinary mam.....WELL DONE...👍🏻😎👍🏻😎
Hahhaha WHAT A MAD-LAD! :D
It's like minecraft ehh
Now think how insane the great escape actually is
Bro you look like John Constantine 😂😂😂 Love the video!!!
When I saw this crazy guy put a bunker in his garden, I KNEW he would add a tunnel some day. 🤣
Hope you've got a good sense of direction otherwise you're going to come up through one of the ventilation towers on Rutland Water!
If I tried that here I'd have ground water in my hole after 2 meters deep.
I can tell that Colin has gotten some noise complaints from his neighbors because he wants to everything in silence lol
If you ever move, someone is getting an EPIC home.
As someone who works in the building industry as you used to,  I'm getting a little concerned about your safety and the safety of your house.  Digging down requires shoring of the excavation to prevent side collapse and potentially injuring you, or worse.  Also when you are digging horizontally and are get closer to your house, have you considered the need to underpin the foundations of your home.  I trust that you have consulted a structural engineer to advise on this.  There is also the worry of cutting through the DPM of your home and the steps you are taking to prevent rising damp from becoming a problem.  Other wise good luck.
I love how Colin always over engineers everything 😂😂
This guy is crazy, I love it
hire some peeps from Gaza.... they'll dig for you another eurotunnel 🤣🤣🤣🤣
So its your fault my Coco pops Break my teeth... Thanks mate
Brittish man digging tunnels... Peaky Blinders? anybody?
RIP resale value.
Lock down would have been best time to do this. This smells fishy.
Holes are fucking hard to dig but as a man I have a weird urge to dig it to completion
Minecraft has told me to never dig straight down. There might be lava carefull!
legally speaking, don't you have to ask for permits to dig even on your own property like in italy?
This reminds me of Andy Dufresne from Shawshank redemption. 20 years of pocket dirt being scattered everywhere lol
Furze has been getting a lot of shit from his neighbors lately on! lol
RL Minecraft
What does your local council say about this?
One day one home owner Will be very surprised on what he finds in his garden..
Well hello bunker boy lol
Lockdown….what are you doing….. make a tunnel to the neighbors bedroom …. Uhh sorry to the shead
Looking at IBM on the toilet! i get it!
Feels like this video isn't so much sponsored as they're paying off a bet that Colin won by doing this. On the other hand, a cool, unorthodox way to expand your real estate :D
Colin is incredible, how far down has he gone? Anyone know?
This remind me so much of their bunker but sadly the stopped uploading 4 years ago https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIirGkbmkOkNnhX36Fm_wMw
I'll be honest, from part one I thought the reason this was started so long ago and a video is only coming out now is because its close to being finished, but then you didn't get to work on it during the lockdown so this project might take a while.
You should have used a jack hammer with a spade bit
I really hope he didn’t actually leave dirt in the grocery store. Imagine buying cereal and having it turn out to be rocks
Minecraft irl
Did you find where the crack goes?  Need to get some big smoke bombs, pressurize the hole with a big fan and maybe you'll see it coming out somewhere.
I'm surprised you never protect yourself from cave-in once you get blow 1 meter. Basic safety rules for excavation say the main shaft should have been re-enforced starting with the first meter and there after. You are a very lucky man.
Secret tunnelllllll
Just be careful pleas not to be crushed by earth
If the carpet covers up the entrance, when you try to leave the tunnel in the shed, won’t the carpet stop you from getting out? There’s probably an easy fix for this, or maybe Colin already knows about it.
Don't try this at home kids, digging deep holes is exceedingly dangerous.  Just digging your own grave 🪦💀
If you need a hand next time, do let us know would be happy to help after lockdown and not getting any exercise :D
Colin, you're a genius, but also a little bit insane! Lol!
Colin, you have gotta be the most entertaining YouTuber to ever exist!
surprised you're not utilising some spiral self digging contraption to do this.
Ahhhh the real reason for the hydraulic pump install. Just shows how long this has been going for!
wow
Surely you mean the “not do secret tunnel”….
Seeing the things in the past happening throughout this is awesome, nicely done sir.
if you need to make tunnels faster, just break 3 blocks, put tnt inside, and explode it. though you will have to clean the mess if theres some dirt in the way
took you long enough
Do you need planning permission for this? It’s awesome!
This channel is just a man being as absolutely mental as he probably is every day and recording it for us. Thanks fam love this ish
#minecraft
Funny how you are trying to do it quiet so the neighbours don't know, but then put it up on the internet...
Yes! It’s ColinFurzday! Looking forward to this
man those mesh wall look something from scifi movies
COOLEST DAD ON THE PLANET AWARD GOES TOO.....
Hi Colin, I believe it is time to drop the word secret!!!   lol
Tea during a tunnel dig. Classic.
Every normal day you make a lot of noise, building rocket bicycles etc, and now you are quite.. Thats suspicious :D
Guess what...it's not a secret anymore 😂
People watch vid on youtube/netflix and etc while colin building a secret but not so secret tunnel during covid
Awesome 🤩👌
if i didn't live in swampy southeast Texas I would have done the same thing. every boys dream, a secret tunnel.
Don't any of his neighbors watch his channel?
British soldiers fortifying their positions in case of German invasion, 1941 (colorized)
Watched this, then did some cleaning, now all i got in my head still is "iiiiii got a brand new bag of limes"!! Man that song is dope
I’d be tempted to chuck a smoke bomb down the crack and see where the smoke comes out
I’m glad it’s not me digging that clay, looks horrendous.
Love how he wants it to be a secret project that nobody knows about but he makes YouTube videos on it
This music is shit
I think being able to see the bare rock could make the tunnel look really good
Ame i the only one who thinks his sponsor is a piramid scheme?
love how youre considerate to your neighbors💯💯💯
Our fam re did our yard but it is very nice seeing people work and you can chill.
awesome
I'm sure he found an ancient burial site and pretend as if nothing happened to keep digging his tunnel.
You should put insulation above you when you get a bit deeper so you can jack away without the neighbors hearing
If there is still a draft, and you are wondering where the crack goes, you could 'potentially' use smoke as a solution.
Not a secret tunnel  no more
the trumpet moment killed me 🤣🤣🤣🤣😭
Another insane project from the master! What prep work was done prior? planning permission? checks for pipes and cables?
wow what an amazing secret 11 million people already know it
He should get an auger
Did you need planning permission for this 😂😂😂
Secret underground tunnel… this guys got 11mil subs
Can't wait for the next video. Don't know how your going top top this one furze
wow. you HAVE been working on this for awhile.
a
Electric diger https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0851SZCDH/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_glt_fabc_PR2YXHP6RJRXXARSCGYN?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1
Can’t wait for part 3!
Moisture intrusion is going to collapse the sidewalls right through the flimsy mesh.
ah yes, the great escape
doing it in front of thousands of people and saying "secret" XD
Considering the history of the country he lives in, the chances of digging Into old church ruins and/or tunnels is pretty substantial to be fair lol. How cool would that be.
Mahn...just stay safe!
'The Danish Invader' looks like a proper shithole!
I wouldnt be so happy about air (or any type of gas) draft from deep under
I’m definitely in two minds if I’d like to be a neighbour 😂 on one hand never a dull day… on the other wondering what the hell is next 😂😂
I love how there's the hashtag minecraft
One day who ever buys your property will discover a long lost bunker and tunnel network underneath.
Wait there was already a pump there tho y u tricking me
8:57 not better with lava?
Cool!
Building secret tunnel and recording building it...
so how many stacks of dirt and cobblestone do you have now
How are you not concerned about gas/water pipes?
This is great, getting chills watching that camera descend. Great content here!!!
Where was the draught coming from.
Colin - used trombone to cover up digging.  Neighbours - watch you tube  Neighbours - "ahhh not again!"
How deep does that crevice go??
I like how he tries to be sneaky and hide what he is doing... on a YouTube channel. xD Edit: I wrote my comment too soon. When I heard him said "it's middle of September" I understand, why he kept it a secret. Well done Colin. Well freaking done! You are an amazing inspiration.
Fred Dibnah approves of this video
Imagine colin furze selling his house. And the guy that bought it never saw colin furze and found out about the tunnels and bunker😂
The police when they find a pit under anyone else's shed: 😡 The police when they find a pit under Colins shed: another project furze?
Would a pointed spade not be better? Like an entrenching tool kind of thing
What's more tiring? Digging for an hour or playing the trombone strenuously for an hour?
The dedication that goes into making these videos are absolutely unmatched
What she sees: 11:39
This will be useful one day
How the hell are you ever going to sell that house? 😂😂😂😂😂
Dig a tunnel  dig dig a tunnel dig a tunnel dig dig a tunnel
I now have suspicions that Colin was secretly a tunnel builder for Escobar
I though you where never supposed to dig straight down...
You know those shortened shovels and picks already exist as military entrenching tools
3:53 stealth 1000
I've seen a story on tv about a guy who dug a tunnel at the beach and it caved in on him
Ill be back for the next vid!
Well, its not secret anymore...
How to build a secret tunnel. Step 1 get permits, step 2 make a youtube video about it.
I was looking forward to some kind of super-high torque high capacity screw-drill with a conveyor belt to get the earth outside the shed.
Ganda maluco
Aren’t u worried about pipes
This reminds me of another YouTuber - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t-ANC0ynDQ he digging down the tunnel to build a bunker. His video just stops after finish the ladder down. I don't know what happens afterware
It’s possible u have found a old air shaft for mining there’s loads of in documented ones all over the contrary
I’m telling my grandkids that this is he was Elon musk
You absolute madman Furze, incredible project. Cant wait till part 3!!!!
🔥
Hydraulic cork screw would move a lot of soil
You have to love his determination.
in case your neightbours are subscribed - your secrecy is screwed
IT RUBS THE LOTION ON THE SKIN OR IT GETS THE HOSE AGAIN !!!! LOL
Love it! All I can think about is the complete silence is so you don’t get caught for planning permission from the council ;)
Not very secret to anyone who watches the channel tho...   Still cool never the less
Makes you realise just how long it must have taken them to dig out Tom, Dick and Harry. Certainly explains why only Harry was completed (barring mishaps and early discovery by German officers)
Amazing. Makes you appreciate how much work when into building bunkers during the war
Building a secret tunnel. Step 1: Show it everybody in the internet ;-)
Saddam hussein
I can imagen the "House For Sale" advert,.. House with #Bunker and tunnel system. trouble is in an #Apocalypse, everyone knows where to find a bunker,...lol
You should name the tunnel 'Harry' Like the tunnel from 'The Great Escape'
That is so dangerous without shoring.
Some people bury time capsules, while Colin buries an entire extension to his property
Free-trade isn't available in the United States colin😂
The rock layer normally has cracks for water to go down into the harder bedrock.
If I would dig to depth you've reached in this video I would be standing in ground water to my chin.
You are Crazy
The best way of getting rid of dirt is to dig another hole and put it down there. .....Ronnie Barker in Porridge not my words.
My favorite Colin Furze build yet!
So what was through the crack ? Also could we get the names of tunes. Some good'ns in this vid
Is this going to be linked to your beach hut
was the tunnel always there
I love how its #minecraft
Finally it's clear why that electric winch has been there all the time.
Why didn't you use an conveyerbelt to transport the soil?
Why not make an underground workshop?!
You gotta make an elevator also insulate your door not only to keep your shed at a constant temp but also to keep the noise down while in the tunnel.
Can you build a skatepark next? I can only imagine how insane it’d be!
You’re working harder than 99% of YouTubers. Crazy video.
Why do you insist on wearing a shirt and tie when doing these really labour intensive work days. We need a Colin Furze tank top on the go
Is anyone gonna tell him what a post hole digger is? 😂😂
I absolutely LOVE the way that this is a "secret" tunnel... Don't worry Colin, us ELEVEN MILLION subscribers will keep your secret safe 😉😋
honestly, its probably way more sus that he's in the shed all the time and there is no noise like he's building a world-ending death machine.
OI! YA GOT A LOICENSE FER DAT SHORT BARREL SPADE?
Never dig straight under your feet or you will fall in lava
Awesome
No longer secret if you broadcast on screw tube !
I tried to dig a tunnel in our back yard, but once you hit 6-7 feet you start to get water flooding the hole. Won't work here in south Florida.
I feel like I had to skip the first 6 minutes. Lame
I building a SECRET tunnel under my house and showing it to a MILLION people
Next he will make an avengers tower 😜
More than anything I want to know what blackmail material Colin has on the people in his local Planning department!
i think that stone layer is the bedrock...
3:55 when your trying to hide from planning permission
Did U figure out what the total volume of the tunnel will be? It’s gonna take forever
Why
The fact that he is trying to be quite so the neighbors don't hear him is AMAZING!
Походу тоже кризис жанра.
this could attract any 10 y/o boy
Today, Colin escapes from Stalag Luft 3
The guys from Primitive TechnologyChanel make it in 3 hour. 🤣🤣🤣
Impressive. Insane. But impressive.
The "I don't have planing permission yet, let's keep it quiet" video
Super cool so jealous
Я один русский подписан и смотрю ролики? Я практически ничего не понимаю на английском языке но безбашенность и приколизм (попробуйте переведите😆) мне очень нравиться. Так держать!!! С приветом и уважением из России.
Please wear a ⛑ helmet from next time . Awesome vid as always . Really looking forward to see it complete 🤩
Just imagine the amount of work the Japanese did in island rock. Very cool tunnel!!! Key word lockdown and silent dig.
This is actually really neat
Mexican cartels laughing at this ameteur gringo tunnel builder 😁
How deep are you planning to go?
You need the guy that randomly making a pool in the middle of jungle to make a digging. They can do it in no time.
I have a feeling the neighbours gave him a bollocking 😂
Only just started watching. I bet you dig another tunnel and put the dirt in that (thanks for the idea Fletch).
how they probably sacaron el chapo part 2
I knew you used The Great Escape as a reference point. Love it.
This is so totally secret from your neighbors except if they watch all of your videos... 🙄
but but but WHAT WAS THE DRAFT???
I’m imagining a few decades down the line when Colin moves out and the house gets new owners all the things they will slowly discover.
How the hell is this legal
oh he mad
Only a Brit would dig a hole wearing a tie.🤣
dude built home made fallout bunker
I'd build a little mountain over the bunker with all that dirt and plant grass . Maby a tree on it :)
Should consider a device that penetrates and wets soil to help the process
I’m too lazy to do this myself so can I just buy your back garden and put it in my garden
Secret TUNNELLLLLL SECRET TUNELLLLL
minecraft but in real life
"secret tunnel" *posts it on youtube with 11M subscribers
Maybe could have saved you alot of time by using a vacuum excavator!🤔
Collin does some of the biggest projects I've seen on YouTube and craziest stunts, yet he is respectful to his neighbors.
This is awesome.  One of the best things on YouTube I'm waiting to see more of.
The dirt will muffle the sound, I don't think your neighbors will hear a thing.
BUCKETS?..  I THOUGHT  THAT IS WHAT A WHEEL BARREL IS FOR.
Why are you so worried about sound with your neighbors? Has there been an issue in the past?
so hes being doing this for ages and nobody knew?
I feel like the stealth and secrecy might be slightly undercut by uploading the build to YouTube
For sale: 3BR home with fenced back garden. Car park and work shed attached. Also includes underground tunnel, bunker, and missile silo. Serious offers only.
But Colin, if you put this on Youtube, it won't be a *secret* tunnel anymore...
It's not a secret tunnel every1 knows about it lol it's just a tunnel
Colin put a jet engine on a vacuum cleaner and try to suck up all the dirt u been digging 🤣
Journey to the centre of the Furze! Loving the fact that yor sections are straight.
Man... the quality of these videos is always so astounding!  Colin, you need to move to America, buy some incredibly massive land, and let your creativity go wild with no boundaries.
*ahem* SECRET TUNNEL!!! SECRET TUNNEL!!!! THROUGH THE MOUNTAIN!!!!! SECRET, SECRET, SECRET, SECRET TUNNEL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
So digging is too loud for the neighbours? But they are cool with the jet bbq? Maybe the lesson is to ply them with food
He's gonna wake up a balrog
What do you mean it’s april xD it’s july now m8! Took you awhile to edit this video i’m guessing lol. Looks interesting though, Looking forward to more.   although hopefully this will be a positive selling point if you ever move out.
I bet you wish you didn’t live in the stoniest area in Lincolnshire 😆
Man, I would love to play hide and seek in that house!
colin is pretending like his neighbors care what he does at this point haha
Not sure if you got the same problem there but if you would have put the dirt in Amazon boxes and set them on your front porch they will disappear before the morning.
This is the most exciting project you've done so far 👍
Secret tunnel, secret tunnel, Through the garden,  Secret secret secret secret tunnel.
You need a digging bar.
At band section, I was so worried about how dirty those nice suits were going to get
I hope you excavated the soil. What ancient relics may be there
I love how one of the hashtags is minecraft.
Could you imagine if Colin does actually stumble upon some hidden underground cave with ancient treasures and artifacts? And it all conveniently levels with the bunker plans?
1> IS that GOLD NUGGETS your diggin up? lol 2> Those plastic container/baskets are THE BEST... I have 2 myself and could go for 3 more :D
I'm telling you Colin is going to be the only one properly prepared for a zombie apocalypse, he has the dream house, bunker, DRILL TANK, everything, this man is going to be the president after the apocalypse because he will be the only one that will have so much power
Can’t believe he hasn’t built a super shop vac to suck the dirt from the hole
Working in secret..👍👍,,wait. whole internet is watching 😂
man this secret tunnel project is fully packed with hilarious gags. I wonder if people will understand half the jokes
I'm sure if Colin's neighbors asked him what he was digging, he probably laughed and said "I'm digging me way outta here!"
You're a regular Isambard Brunel! just don't get caved in on Colin!
Anyone else getting some sort of shawshank redemption vibe?
I feel like the music is so the authority’s don’t come and tax/shut you down for digging
you need to add a knob to your router that you can turn to 11, and then it stays there locked in place. :)
Colin, you're a innovative guy, how about you start uploading your videos to Odysee as well? it's an investment and it counteracts YouTube having a monopoly. No time to loose, let's go!
Everything is possible in Colins hands!
Not gonna lie. Was expecting a conveyor belt setup.
I've been waiting since last week for the Great Escape reference.
How is it secret if you post it to youtube?
FAR CRY 5 BUNKER TUNNEL 💪😁👍
we can safely say that this was colin's lockdown project
colinfurze does such weird stuff i didnt even notice he was vaccuming his hair
SECRET TUNEL! SECRET TUNEELL!!!
Is that a sock full of soil in your trousers or are you just pleased to see me
Think the neighbours would gave noticed all the skip lorries that keep showing up !!
Should've used a diamond shovel, not a dirt shovel! That entire block by dig 5 would've been gone in a single click!     Wait wrong game
The last bit felt like the batcave closing in!
what about some mega hydraulic screw?
Simply brilliant 😄👍
It's not really a secret...
Why not use a Hydralic drill
Malayali indo
Secret
Please please tag me in next video
So, later in life, my grand ambition is to start an indie space program. And as crazy as it might sound, I'm currently forming a plan, (which might take years) and gathering the skills I need to do it. Seeing this video made me realize I'd entirely neglected the construction portion of the whole project. Thanks for the reminder, and a brilliant job done, colin!
The thing is, now you have posted this on the internet, it is not exactly very secret is it?
What an awesome life, can't wait for the next one, but obviously will have too. 😊🎃☠️
That's pretty dang cool
dude at the start without the title you would think he is make a drug den
British elon musk moment
Honestly I'm gobsmacked that we havent seen a large diameter screw digging contraption yet. That mightve been better for the mud
Colin, how in the world are you getting planning permisson lol. I love it. This is something i've been dreaming of doing since i was a kids.  Roll on next week :)
He’s an insane man. If he didn’t record it I wouldn’t believe he dealt with all that digging
Digger bhai love from India 🇮🇳😍😍
What do you mean "maximum deapth"? Keep going lower!
THE FACT that you remained dedicated to wearing a nice shirt with a tie even while digging a fucking hole in the ground is truly inspiring XD
If you really enjoy what ever the fk your doing you will succeed!
I feel like they've made a noise complaint about you 😂
2:06 Den er Dansk LIKE hvis du også er
V. E. N. T. I. L. A. T. I. O. N. !!!  CARBON DIOXIDE AND MONOXIDE ARE HEAVIER THAN AIR AND SINK TO THE BOTTOM OF HOLES AND TUNNELS!!!  BOTH are LETHAL.  SORT THE VENTILATION SOON PLEASE!!!
I love how Collin hasn’t aged in like 10 years
How do you get in and out???
Now imagine doing this without power tools, but with actual secrecy in Berlin pre 1989 under a wall and a minefield.
Does freetrade work in the EU? Saaay Sweden for example?
*SEEECRET TUNNNELLL!!!*
1:25 That's probably the first time I've seen a Great Escape reference in a youtube video. Loved it.
Band practice looks like two mafia guys trying to bury a body in the basement.
I am so jealous
Very secret lol
Just imagine what people think when they find this hatch in 100 years
4:47 Top right corner: "Your Capitol is at Risk!" Americans: "Again!? Really!? COME ON!"
9:28  He's just dug one dirt block, good job mate
you can say this video is full of "groundbreaking" inventions
What no homemade T.B.M. "tunnel boring machine"??? Or at least an electric post hole digger.
Incredible video Colin!!!!
colin no wonder you are having a tough time digging down you are on clay rich dirt and from what i can tell from the video its more clay than dirt. also side note for the sound problem if you get an LED flood light down there so you can see then you could be able to temporarily seal off the entrance with insulating foam or something to dampen the noise
Colin Furze, the only mad lad that could make digging a tunnel absolutely entertaining! haha!
"No fart jet powered corkscrew driven death mobile," said the neighbors.   "Oh, e's just making YouTube videos," says his mum.  "Lets go watch his videos to see wot e's up to."
No hand-made boring machine? Boring! ;)
Cool story bro! xD Seriously, you should think about some ventilation down there!
mistake #1 didn't use a conveyor system to throw the dirt out OR use a big hose vacuum system like used for sand transport in sand warehouses
why so concerned about the noise? trying to avoid building permits ? haha
el chapo

So thats why you put the hydrolics and ceiling crane in over the last two years...
Wow the hydraulic unit build is pretty old already, and you ware digging at that time already 😲
Do I need to go to engineering school to be as happy as this man is 🤣
This is so cool. I want to do this too!
These Minecraft graphics are unreal
This madlad does the coolest shit.
Could you not try sneaking your neighbours house on the sponsor’s expense bill? You could be as noisy as you like then.
метр за неделю ? продуктивностью не пахнет
Why do you upload things that happened much later than they happened? Can you not upload things when they happen, or do you just like doing it this way?
Colin literally builds machines for a living but he decides to dig a hole by hand???
Never thought I would say this, but please be carefull Colin. We can live without a tunnel to the bunker, but we can't live without your video's...
Is this legal?
Just enchant the shovel
What is the music track that starts at 12:16? It's not listed in the description. It deserves a full listen!
Where did that Crack go? I was hoping you would unearth and underground kingdom of mole men or somthin.
Woow thats a Big project
Bro go buy a auger lol
You should make a v10 hoover
this guy really said a secret entrance lmao it couldn't be more noticeable
Missed opportunity to say “I got a jar of dirt!”
😂🤣😂🤣🤣
Do you play minecraft or you got this  idea from somewhere else?.
i'm not sure why your so concerned about sound...i mean honestly, it's probably stranger to your neighbors when you are quiet...they probably think you're doing something shady when that happens...
never dig straight down!
What the lock down stop you from digging?
Yo Collab with El Chapo he good at this he'll help u out, the process will go much faster.
🇨🇦Happy Canada day!🇨🇦
Why can't he make noise?
HOW AM I NOT SUBSCRIBED TO COLIN FURZE?????
Great job! Keen for part 3🔥🙌
This man has to be really strong after this
SECRET TUNNEL
capitol ? you mean capital ?
Remember the mole man,  Dug tunnels all over his street, All the houses had to be pulled down lol
This project is nuts. I love it 😁
So I’ve been randomly recommended this video and I gotta say it’s rather entertaining but what the fuck am I watching lmao, I just saw what is seemingly an insane Brit dig a hole in his shed, while dressed like a man I would assume is just a nerd, and then proceed to do a large number of illegal dumps of dirt and stealing cereal, then had an ad roll where he talks to a vacuum and was inside a cookie jar and some other wacky stuff… needless to say: wtf
That's what we all did in Minecraft in 1 minute. You are doing it in the real world and it requires months. That's great willpower and effort. Good job!! 👌
did you find out where that tiny cave went ?
What is maximum digging depth and why is it maximum?
Middle of September? Why is the video so old?
I just bought a house, how long should I give it before I tell the wife we're getting a tunnel to the new workshop planned for the end of the garden? ;)
Wearing business suit while mining underground. 😂
Better pay that man royale he's a keeper.
Want some help
Colin i live just over the back and we can hear you almost everyday and we watch your vids , the whole street knows 😅
Ball show my friend you are a genius.
This is exactly what El Chapo's guys did to spring him from prison.   I can't wait to see the finished tunnel.
Colin why are you so concerned with noise these days? Given all of the projects you’ve done
Men really do just play with their toys & dig holes😭😂
No tunnel boring machine?  This cant be Colins Channel.
Never dig straight down
Very cool. Hope you plan on water proofing the tunnel, adding fresh air and proper lighting when completed.
Poor Collin digging is such a pain mainly getting rid of loose dirt
He is making the hydraulic pump installation in this video 7:38 but you can see it in his workshop tour video back in 16 april 2020....that's how long it's been going on. ;)
I am so excited for you
A moment of silence (literally) for Colin's work from March 2020 - April 2021
dang awesome !!!
Omg colin you are extremely hardworker
The other day I saw an idiot digging a tunnel with out a tie on WTH?
Colin builds all the stuff i dreamed i could as a kid
Watch out for oxygen down there Colin! You'll need an air detector! Tunnels like that can be very carbon monoxide heavy many people have died in very similar ways!
Weiß die Queen das ihr Königreich unterkellert wird?!?😄
Why are u so worried about making noise? You're inside the ground and inside a shed, and the neighbors are inside their house. It can't be that loud for them.
Nah, but seriously. WTF you doing with all that dirt?
The next homeowners are gonna have a head scratcher about this one
I swear Colin cracks me up. The skit about getting rid of the dirt was pure gold XD
One of the best video I have seen today
Awesome I’ve been following the channel from day 1 and this project is already my favourite 💪
Crazy how in WWI they were digging tunnels like this by hand
Colin Furze digs a border smuggling tunnel
Tom Lamb , legendary Mate
Because using brass instruments in your little garage isn't more conspicuous lol.
when you dont have RTX to play minecraft IN Ray tracing so you started playing in real life
Neighbour: What are you up to now? Colin: Nothing (Starts whisteling the Great Escape)
This is awesome
The new Minecraft cave update is getting WILD 🤣
"SECRET"
The British government to MI5:  keep an eye on this eye one rumour has it he plans on building a nuclear submarine Colin: I know what I am going to do today
that, sir, is a very large hole.  Future archaeologists are going to be fascinated by Colin's excavations.
is this legal
u are the best
Everyone else is just a poser.   Furze:  I craft all day I mine all night!
Planning permission /building regs nightmare .... no?
Im pretty sure your neighbours know what you're doing right now specially if they use the internets
This man can make even hole digging exciting 😂🤣😂🤣 I'm working sometimes with the pipe repair/service guys they do it every day for living and... there is not even 1/10 of Collin's excitement 👍
I love it how Colin got the hydraulic system for this project but had to make another video as a cover for why he got it
imagen when he dies and someone buys that house
I don't mean to be one of those guys, but be careful in low confined spaces with a motor, and you might want to seriously consider a ventilation system. excellent work as always Colin
I love how you continue to show the best tool anyone could ever have is their imagination ingenuity
SECRET TUNNEL~~~~ SECRET TUNNEL~~~~ THROUGH THE MOUNTAIN~~~~ SECRET SECRET SECRET SECRET TUNNEL~~~~~~~~  - Colin Probably
This is why I come to this channel Colin you mad mad man is there anything you won’t make or do
Approved by El Chapo.
This is literally "Don't work hard work smart"
5:16 does this means he’s gonna make a jet powered shop vac
Lovely
The Furze Chunnel?
Surprised you haven't rigged up some sort of shed-built hydraulic motor powered TBM Colin :)
Do you think he has all the proper building permits to do this?
So all this time there was a tunnel under your house and we didn't know?
You find out where the breeze was coming from Colin? Genuinly really intresting find.
Prisons around the world don’t want him be there. Just for fun
Waiting for the Furze TBM !!!
So your trying not to make much noise to your neighbors yet your shareing this on YouTube
I kinda like the black suit furze!
I can't believe Minecraft didn't sponsor this
I feel like a lot of people have a weird instinct to dig a root cellar or tunnel system. It has evolutionary advantages big time. To be able to increase the surface area of your living space by creating an artificial cave.
Colin is legit living out every childhood fantasy as an adult! I'm super jealous and impressed! Godspeed little Furze-y! GODSPEED!
Congrats... You found the sewer pipe !!!
mate youre having a laugh
*9:24** What just happened?* Sir, sir, I think we hit bedrock What does that mean? It means you can't go any deeper Good. Oh, wh-why is that, sir? There's nothing deeper than me!
Does a lot of work to hide the digging while uploading to millions of viewers. Well....ok
Crazy
U are crazy
the internet is so weird he could probably sell the dirt to fans
Minecraft secret tunnel 😂😂
What happens if you hit a German uxo from the World War 2 your Neighbours well definitely hear that
Collin furze is the the best neighbor you could ever have.
Take a hose and spray water down the crack and see where it comes out.
I'm glad you are above the water table, would really screw things up if this flooded with water!
Dude how is that secret in any way?
🎵SECRET TUNNEEEEEL🎵
Just building Rick’s garage
Colins son is going to have a fun time playing hide and seek with his friends
It's so cool how you are trying to make this a completely secret project using hydraulics and special tools to stay quiet. However it's not so secret anymore now that it is on YouTube! Great video Colin, keep up the great work! 🧡
could you please sing the secret tunnel song from avatar?
I dreamed of building something similar in my backyard when i was 8 and now i'm seeing someone actually digging in his own garden a secret freaking tunnel between his house and his shed ! This is awesome well done !
If you find any cool rocks put them in a cool rock pile
Does anyone know the name of the song starting at 12:16?
What is that round yellow thing behind Colin (at the end)?  Is that an air sensor?
MAKE FULL PART VIDEO PLSSS!!!
1:34 YOOOOO🥵😳
Правильно, правильно! А то путин нападет и негде будет прятаться😂😂😂
This guy might just dig a batcave all by himself
For some reason I didn’t think that you were crazy enough to dig an entire tunnel by hand, but I respect the effort and am glad it’s you not me!
colinfurze now has been placed under police suspicion from the noise he's making
I would have propably gave up at 1min mark
please use ear protection
SECRET TUNNEL, SECRET TUNNEL, THROUGH THE GARDEN!!
Its not that secret considering how many views this guy has lol
Is this completely legal tho? I don't understand how properties work but do you bascially own it all the way in the ground or?
So maybe you try to make a simple tunnel boring machine? You have success with screw tank project, so i think you can do it! =)
get a wider showel trust me i know alot about diging
SECRET TUNNEL! SECRET TUNNEL! THROUGH THE MOUNTAIN SECRET SECRET SECRET SECRET TUNNEEEEEEEEEEL!!!!! yeah
Tom looks just like that dude that you would know that wouldnt care if you had 10 or 10 million followers he would still treat you the same. You do you Tom.
I’m glad this guy remembered to get shulker boxes.
The real question is if there’s going to be a platform that carries you to the bottom and top of the tunnel like an elevator but for mine shafts
Before he got told if he sold he had to sell as Bunker with house, i wonder how  the description has to be said once the tunnels are finish?
An el chapo joke definitely got used on the makings of the tunnel
"Sacred tunnel~~ Sacred tunnel~~"
9:10 was just thinking you could do with a pully
Mr Furze - you are one very serious cookie. All power to you.
Lol when he invites the person is looks like there diging up a grave
Oooh hasss mineing
Colin: I don't want to disturb the neighbors with the sound of my digging * Plays music louder than the digging sounds *
I’m more excited about this weekly series than the Loki series, I love secret tunnels more than anything.
Once you get to y 13 you can start looking for diamonds. I though he would make a makeshift tunnel boring machine.
It's tunnel time
alright i gotta know how did he get the furniture in there
If the neighbours heard the jackhammer in your shed they'd probably think "Oh, he's probably just making an automatic apple peeler or a cat shaver. Business as usual".
Secret tunnel that only 11,000,000 people know about...we need part 3 come on Colin get your finger out
I am that guy who Starts Skipping the Video  As soon as i hear the word *"Sponsor"*
"House needs to be attached to the bunker, rather than a house with a bunker." - Colin March 2020 Colins video --> https://youtu.be/ZQy89tZ-mRU?t=494
Love the allusion to The Great Escape. or was that Colditz or Hogan's Heroes?? I'm cornfused
A shovel in spiral does a better job ! Great video!!
You are making me want to build a mancave.
-digs a secret tunnel -proceeds to record digging it and share it with 11 million people
Colin discovers why subways and sewers take so long to build.
You can never move house in your life
You put that hydraulic pump in ages ago
Love it
He might find a whole treasure chest while digging for this tunnel.
I'm shocked that Colin installed the hydralic system for this project and not his press. The things you learn from this man!
But @Colinfurze its really important to know where you crack goes to! Get on it and investigate man!
Furze, did that need planning permission? Ide love to go to the garage underground... I would also also have the jam underground on a loop down there
OMG ! What an amazing project !! Please man ! Don't give up !!
No one:     The Music: I GOT A BRAND NEW BAG OF LIIIIIIIMMMMMMMEEEEEEESSSSSSS
0:49 I think this is what gives a better understanding to "everyday people" what does it mean to "dig a tunnel". You read in the news, that criminals dug a tunnel to reach the bank's vault, or to escape from a prison; or just people under certain walls back in the not too far history to get to the other side. But see this picture: there isn't practically any visible progress, and you already have 6 big buckets of soil to get rid of! This puts the achievement of those people to a whole new level! It's an overwhelmingly huge job, especially if you can't use the otherwise readily available technology! Very interesting, let's see where this will end up :)
Where is the water table?
How about a hydraulic arm with a slow rotating cutting head usually used to dig or bore tunnels. Would be a great homemade project. And relativly quiet.
I was expecting a Roman villa.
Thanks for digging to China for all of us who couldn't make it that far!
You are a true gentlemen if you were digging while wearing a FULL SUIT
It looks like a proper industrial mine or something with that mesh framework
BEST part about this is the custom shovel🔥🔥
One of the coolest British guy🤣
"turning the internet up to 11" genius catchphrase!
The real question is where was that draft coming from!
Isnt the bit about cleaning the shelf and installing the pump from another video?
Is it really a secret if it’s here on YouTube hmmm? Dope though honestly lol
Freetrade not available in your country, welp fck EU....
Thank you freetrade for sponsoring colins build as he has not monetized his channel. I will definitely visit freetrade
Cheers 🥂
Let’s hope his neighbours don’t watch this channel….not very secret
Why didn't you use an auger?
You can use a shovel attachment for the jackhammer.
welcome to our World there sonny Jim..... would like to know where that Cave system goes ....we found one similar in the bedrock as well..... don't forget the ventilation system
Imagine how awesome will the final result be. Good luck Mr.Furze
Secret tunnel! Secret tunnel! Through the garden! Secret, secret, secret, secret tunnellllll, YEAH!
Two men with sticks could do it quicker 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Im sorry colin, i skipped the bit
On today's episode of This Old Meth...   :-P
Please don’t hurt your back Colin!!
Couldn't buy a proper shovel?
damn another amazing project
I would be very upset if during the course of these videos he does not have The Avatar secret tunnel song
"Your Capitol is at risk" Americans: again?
Just build some small TBM
Secret Tunnel!!! Now I want to watch Avatar. Lol
I absolutely love watching your channel and always look forward to the next. You build as an adult what every boy dreams of as a kid! Huge props to you for making little boy dreams a reality.
welcome to the man cave
Honestly you’re one of the people I’d want to live if shit it the fan.
So this video was supposed  to be sent last year but because of the pandemic it got delayed?
Engineering at its finest  Buying a long shovel & cutting it into half to make it small   Rather than buying a small one
Don't you need planning permission to dig a tunnel?
If I was your neighbor, I'd say let extend this bad boy to my yard!
Come On Rule #1: DONT DIG STRAIGHT DOWN!!
I am wondering what the city he lives in thought about this and did they allow it to happen
Love the film, The Great Escape. Where's Steve McQueen when you need him?
Any other neighbors find it suspicious that he has been so quiet lately?  What is he doing in there?!  Also it isn’t a secret if it is on YouTube 😂😂.  Hands down he has the luckiest kids ever!  #DaddyFurze
I have a games channel in Brazil promotes it male
Quality mate
thx for thinking about the safty. the sand hole you digged and crawled down in to made me really scared
I see an auger in the future
Secret tunnel secret tunnel through the mountain secret tunnel
Next Episode colin does ''We Met The Illuminati'' we kept going and found a complete City Underground lol Awesome Project ! Your Living the Dream
Just make 2 Robots to dig and remove the dirt out ?
dude needs a haste II beacon
LOOK THERES A DRAFT! But imagine he just burst into a gas main lmao
dont want anyone knowing you're digging a hole? not letting the council in on your secret hmm?
This man sounds like he's executing a heist by how quiet he's tryna be
It is coming to the point were Colin wont ever need to go outside anymore
SECRET TUNNEL ! SECRET TUNNEL !
Imagine the property value of Colin's place after all the things his built.
So this is where mr. furze has been during covid
i love how colin has not changed at all from 2018 to 2021 😂😂😂
all this time colin was adding new features to the shed to help this project when we all thought it was just adjustments to the shed
What a cool guy
Imagine buying his house in 70 years en finding out there is a bunker in your backyard
Colin I'm   pretty sure you being quite is a cause of worry for your neighbors
HELL YEAH BROTHER
Near the bunker will be the hardest, thinking back at the time it was made.
I really could not wait for you to do something nutts... love it :)
You could have just used a rotary hammer with a clay spade to work at 10× the speed.
The pain of having a small layer of dirt under your house.
God I love your work so much, your truly an inspiration to me! Keep up the amazing work
Why it takes him so much time? It's easy!I did it with my bare hands in a few minutes! All my minecraft houses have even bigger tunnels!
Colin: I need to be quiet so nobody knows I’m building a secret tunnel.  Also Colin: Posting it on YouTube for millions of people to see.
Something tells me that you really really don't want the police to find this while they are investigating a noise complaint.
My question is how is Colin getting in and out of the hole?
This is like a childhood dream of mine 😂
You should weld 2shovels together and attached it to an 2000w angle grinder and let the machine do all the work Maybe put a speed controller to the grinder incase everything starts flying around😂
Holy shit the amount of work this requires is crazy.
Idk about all of you but this man's projects and videos share things that I can only dream about doing!
You are a genius, there is no other word to describe you.
i still don't get why he covers up, that he builds a tunel to gis bunker
In hindsight would you have built a conveyor?
Can I say, his music choice is fire!
Would an auger not have helped in some parts? Just wondering.
Can you build a roller coaster please...
This man is playing minecraft in real life. The MAD LAD!
Man 1: Hey bro what's your workout? Man 2: I dig.
Absolutely loved the underground bunker build I have a feeling this will be the same can't wait for part 3 💯
your friend looks like Notch
So secret when over 10 million people no about it
He's on his 5th spade, his 3rd hydraulic ram and his 10th planning officer. The previous 9 had to have their memories wiped and entered into witness protection so the neighbours couldn't find them.
OOOOOH I WANT TO WATCH THE NEXT ONE ALREADY
This is amazing I have waited so long for someone to make a video like this
You are really a amazing dude🤘🏻 just f*cking genius 😈 I really rock your video’s and ideas!!!
Think of all the videos we watched not knowing that Colin was standing on a secret tunnel lol
Descend to the batcave!
That’s looking deep
When colin passes on and someone else buys this house, they're going to be so fucking confused as to why there is a gamer bunker and giant tunnel under the house and garden.
Why not building a long conveyor belt that takes all the rocks and gravels straight to a skip lorry?? Love your channel Colin. Big ups from Mauritius mate!!!!
Efficiency 5 could have made it faster
What if the stair treadmill was used as a conveyor belt to move the soil out of the shed?
Where did that hole go where the wind was coming from ?
My favorite parts were the winch for moving dirt up and down, and the supports on the side
Wow.
I'd love to see all the planning permission and declarations you had to do for this
Good work and I am waiting for the next one now :)
How legal can this be?
So cool.but even during the war they shored up as they went. Don't want someone getting hurt tho you are confident in your skills. I'm totally jealous of everything you build. I been a rail road welder And mechanic for 20 years and your skill set blows me away.would be super.cool to meet you one day..if you ever want to travel state side and do a build you would be more then welcome. Keep up the awesome videos. Update...i paused the video before i saw the wire wall shoring. But didn't you already have a hydro power unit set up under your bench years or at least pre covid?
Need more Tom Lamb... funny fella... likes to blow stuff up
Was watching all the videos I missed, have been watching for 2 hours and by the time I got to this video I didnt realize this was uploaded an hour ago
Did u have to get any permission by the local council to dig/mine a tunnel in the garden
why are you beeing silent when you upload to youtube anyway? or is it just to be nice bause they have a new baby or somthing?
Capital*
Colin build a tunneling machine come on fella
1969 Vietcong soldier digging a tunnel past the GIs colorised
Secrets must be secrets.....🤧🤦‍♂️
If that door fell on your head, that would hurt a lot. I would make a latch to secure it for now.
Could you some sort of tunnel borer or Archimedes screw setup to make your job somewhat easier?
Why not try like the scene where they threw the earth in Prison Break 😂
Technically it's not a secret tunnel if you upload it to Youtube.
Remember minecraft rule :                     *Don't dig down* ⬇️
OHHHHH! My aching back! It is fascinating watching a Mad Genius at work. One Concern, ground water. In most places in the world the depth you're at would be at or even below the water table. It would usually require a sump pump to prevent flooding.
thank you for telling us about your secret tunnel :)
How come your aloud to dig straight down irl but in micecraft
SECRET TUNNEELLLLL,,,SECRET TUNNELLLL
Go lord! Btw nice way to give out your address lol! Do you recommend that bar sorry I meant pub.
This video makes me really appreciate digging/mining in Minecraft a whole lot more!
Colin: jumps through so many hoops so neighbors won’t find out about his tunnel Also Colin: posts on YouTube for millions of people to watch
You've done a good job of explaining how to avoid HOA
This guy can literally survive when a zombie apocalypse happen.
love how much fun you and tom are having
i havent been this excited since the underground bunker build.
where is the airflow coming from, Colin ?
look i don't mean to be the party pooper here. but it's not that secret if you put it on youtube
Minecraft
What did the crack go  too?!?!?
Can wait part 200!
why are you so quiet when building, i really dont get it. if its illegal building then they will find out anyway because your are uploading to youtube LOL
This video is so amazing it'd go so far as to say I dig it :)
This is brilliant!. If an apocalypse happens and he cant for some reason come out in the open, never mind,this guy has a WHOLE secret tunnel running under his property. Genius.
Finally a project I can relate to.
"How to dig: Take a lot. Throw it far away. Rest while it flies." Russian proverb
I'm sure someone else has already posted this but.... It rubs the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.
Colin in the biscuit tin had me DYING hahaha
Why does this video have a Minecraft hashtag lol.
He's worried about annoying his neighbors with noise. Dude if I found out my neighbor was making a secret tunnel from his super awesome shed to his even more super awesome bunker, I wouldn't be annoyed at all, I would just want to help in the process haha.
So cool brother, just digging a tunnel through your house. That feels so badass.
Colin has  a proper batcave now... A colin cave
Soon, Collin is gonna get cocky and is gonna end up building a nuclear missile pointing towards Buckingham Palace.
Watch next time, when Colin crashes into a sewer in that moment Andy Dufresne crawls by....
We need more videos faster
Was expecting a conveyor belt with container in the end... Amateur :-)
6:06 skip sponsor 😆
Its not exactly secret if your uploading it to youtube lol :/
This would be easier in Minecraft
Can someone name the moving in the begging I haven’t seen that movie in years since I was little 😭😭
Colin you are bankers lol👍👍
Did you just guys get SO confused when he put old clips from the hydraulic video?
Not so secret if you tell people about it
Seriously EPIC... Building childhood dreams! Love this channel!
5:28  stock photos be like
Your back must be in bits
What about the breeze or potential cave? I’m eager to know what the heck that was all about.
This man is playing Minecraft in real life
This is the most punk thing I have seen for a while
Cant wait til this is done omg!!!
10:50 your neighbors secret bunker
I'd love you to get a building control inspection done.
Always easy projects. Lol
Just remember that you are working in confined space, especially when your doing welding and other hot works that you can suffocate from the level of CO2! Carbon dioxide is heavier then air. Mabey you can invest in a CO2 detector? Gr 8 project btw !
should have built a boring machine just for this project.  A screw tank that has a big drill on the front. I wonder if he knows how to build a screw tank
Wait a minute.... So you built your shop hydraulic system for this! The Press was just an excuse to hide the real reason. I feel lied to.  :0
👍👍👍👍👍
i dont get it. there was already a tunnel from the shed to the bunker
how long has colin had this tunnel for? I swear he had that hydraulic system in his shed for a few years already, it was there in the last shop tour aswell.
Hey I saw you on TV a few months ago
Bruh is that allowed?!
this wedgie thing or whatever you want to call it. 😂
He should buy his neighbours property  and dig more tunnels over there...not  worrying about the NOISE and that WHOUD be the coolest.keep on digging. p.s. too bad he didn't modified the SCREW tank into a digging mole  machine...
It’s not really a secret tunnel if everyone knows. Lol 😂 cool project man
Imagine if nuclear ballistic missile submarines were hiding underneath the ocean but the crew *has* to make an youtube video. 🤣🤣🤣
Are contemplating to maybe put an elevator there? Seems like something you'd do i think 🤷‍♂️
Put the lotion in the basket!
Absolutely loving it.   I can’t even believe that this has been secretly in the background on most of your videos and we’ve not even been any wiser !
By making a head to drill like the ones in drilling rig. And adding large hoover in it y could have just hoover all dirt outside.
I wanna face palm but I enjoyed the vid lol
Why is this video tagged with #minecraft 😂
that would be so highly illegal in Germany 😂
never dig straight down
Just make a conveyor belt out the door and into the buckets
Colin builds a "Panic Room" is next on the list. :)
When you're gonna sell the house, there will be either A lot of questions A lot of surprises All of the above (And bellow)
WTF did i just stumble into. Is the Monty Python Makers Show? Lols
But where is the crack which he find during digging, there was a draft going somewhere.
isn't begging to not skip ads against youtube and googles TOS? isn't that the reason they canceled WingsOfRedemption's account

Colin, again great work. Sick hole!!!!
I thought you were British not Vietnamese
Spade doesn't fit, need quiet digging tools.   Normal person: Scours amazon for hours "well, drat." Colin Furze: "Lets make new power tools the world has never seen !"
You really went through all that trouble just so you could get that part in the video where you leave soil and a note on some café? You are some weird ass dude, I love it!
What happen with the Crack in the limestone? Did he build a floor out in the shaft?
Anyone else confused why he stopped digging a hole.... underground..... within a steel bunker.... under the ground. Because of the noise🤔and he didn’t want to disturb his neighbors 🤯oooooookay🤷‍♂️
Boy with such a wacking great hole id expect the Time  Time to be present. Cheers Colin on another amazing projext
You’re working harder than 99% of YouTubers. Crazy video.
How about the dirt
This would be a good way to hide a corpse
telling the internet you've got a secret tunnel sort of stops it being secret
This reminds me of when I had to dig out my cellar foundation. My back is aching in sympathy!
I'm really wondering how many man hours have gone this project, Colin? 100's or 1000's of hours?
This is basically MC irl
So you've been digging in silence... is this tunnel not-legal? Your concern for your neighbor makes it sound like they're one noisy day from reporting you or something.  I can't believe that all your other projects have been done in silence or only while your neighbors were away.
You need to buy or make an auger for a powerful drill for digging. Put buckets under where your drilling so the dirt fall into the buckets. Buy big hammer drill, van be used on the limestone also
Fallout: Real Reality
You are absolutely crazy
Nice job
Let me come live and you shed for a year as a pair of hand your teaching lel, I'm in a bad place :/
Serious question though, did you have to inform your house insurance company that you built the tunnel?
ok this man has the maturity of a teen the mind of a engineer and the sanity of a maniac
Welcome to the Colin furze channel where we do messy work and look good doing it 😂
i sooo want to see next video now :D GG as always ! quite a project this one XD
careful could be gases you need a detector to be safe CO2 and Radon can be dangerous
i can just imagine his neighbours seeing this and being like “so that’s what all the music was about”
Ooo.. A englishman who can do garden work without having to be in the rain. 👍
I used to think this type of thing was impossible... you proved me wrong sir!
One of the few YouTubers which manage to keep me watching the adds
I don’t get why you are so bothered about your neighbours. They were so lovely to us when we did the bunk bath 😆 #NoBangingOnASunday  -Ruth
Make a hydraulic soiler ripper that  rotates!
If you tried this in the U.S., they'd just come to your house, shoot your dog, and throw you in jail. You know, "freedom."
Already commented i know but just have to say, ive had a sh!t day and seeing this has changed all that,
Looking good Colin Iam suprised you've not hit gold 👍🤪👍
Did you need any permits to dig so deep?
Nooo I wanted to see more!!! 😭
Love the Shawshank reference
Secret? Really???
You obviously do not have any water issues.
Is this legal in the UK??
wonder at one point Colin realized that... maybe his neighbors subscribe to his channel... and are like "Look at what this bloke is doin'..."  Did I mention this is bad ass.......
A lift. You totally need a lift.
I can’t wait to see this finished
you're a crazy man and i love it
"Secret underground tunnel" puts it on youtube and shows everyone
Or, what I did during the Corona virus lock-down while on meth.
The resell value of this house is going to be.... confusing.
@3:55 if i was the neighbor id rather hear them digging.........
Yes its here
I love rope way up and day then leaders just in case
I have always wanted to do something like this when I get a house lol this is so cool
I get the feeling the neighbours have moaned. Jealousy is the route of all evil!
Use an auger geniusi dunno how you think people can hear you 13 get under ground
Wait?? Jack n Gin?! Am I late to the party or something? Lol
Waiting for DIY tbm
yay
My Youtube membership money is well spent when you get content like this 👆👆👆

real life minecrafter
I guess you are not worried about cave ins.
You should sell the earth in tiny jars at ridiculous prices. It will look smashing beside my collection of delphine bath water xD
That's it, i´m start my digging today!
1:56 I laughed hard at this part
if i were your neighbour, after years of crazy things i will be way more suspect of lack of noises
Secret tunnel he says, posting a video on YouTube 😂
This has been a dream of mine since I was a lad. Really cool can't wait for the next vid
Incredibly, this is the project that excites me the most! Can't wait to see how it unfolds!
I believe you are absolutely MAD! Thank you. Keep it up!
Alexa, play Diggy Diggy Hole by The Yogscast
Wasn't bunker hill something else?
When you have done the tunnels make a railway track like in a old mine with a wagon that fits the track that you can ride on.
Local Brittish man digs a tunnel to escape corona restrictions
What about something like an augur type drill to break up the bulk of it? Those things they use for boreholes for water but sideways?
the hydraulics part is so unreal... That video was so long ago!
you should have used some tnt
How did you avoid making a well
Dig dig a tunnel quick before the hyenas come
Digging an underground tunnel... all the time wearing a tie. LIKE A FUCKING BOSS!!!
If I'll ever decide to ro b a bank this will b my go2 vids fosho
'Secret' underground tunnels with 11 million subscribers lol
Dude you must have a strong back..
love the work he puts into these vids
SECRET TUNNEL! SECRET TUNNEL!
How the hell did they give you planning permission for this haha I love it
im loving this series so far
how many Mountain dews?
Colin Furze going full Fritzl.
My first time watching a video of his, not quite sure how I expected
This makes me think of how fun it was as a kid to just go out the back and dig a massive hole
He's digging a "SECRET" tunnel and telling a 10 million people about it😂 .. ..
Dale dug a hole.
As soon as I read the title, my brain went: "Secret Tunnel! Secret Tunnel! Through the Mountain! Secret, Secret, Secret, Secret Tunneeeel!"
POV: your binge watching all of colinfurzes videos
*IM JUST WAITING IN DREAD FOR THE INEVITABLE  BBC ALERT* on my phone saying "Popular YouTuber Colin Furze died today in an accident whilst [insert idiotic thing]"
I skip the ad I can do all of that in like 3 days
was fully expecting you to convert your screw tank to a screw digger like the ninja turtles
Yall still locked down over there?   Damn no wonder there's so many people from the UK in Florida
This is one heck of a workout routine.
don’t know if it’d rock or suck to be his neighbor
life 360 wouldove been helpful'
I've watched your videos for a long time now and I've always been impressed with your work and it's quite obvious your skills are on a higher level than your average Joe but it wasn't until this project that I realized how strong your dedication is. What a massive undertaking and it's highly entertaining to watch a master at work.
A spoiler but you neighbours can just watch YouTube to figure out wat you are up to. :o
Wonder when he's going to make a claim for subsidence with his house insurance company.
Getting batman vibes 😆
Look up a hilti 70 with a spade bit. We used them in foundation repair and the rip the Missouri clay apart in tight spots
This is awesome this video went by to fast i want more
Pablo Escofurze lol
Colin, should just build a long chain saw but instead of blades, have mini shovel heads on it and make a mini excavator, have it cycle the mud and dirt out for you
Hes got his own freaking Mine if he keeps it up hes gonna have to install an elevator
This is crazy!
Middle of September now? Maybe post the video of the time machine build.     Yeah I know what your gonna say...
Why is the music always shit in his vidos?
did you ever end up investigating that crack? where does it lead?
Videos not long enough
Hydraulis system mmmm.. have been that before
don't forget to create an air supply
Now look here Colin if I go for a Dump and your head pops up out of my toilet I ain't going to be bests pleased
amazing how much comes out of a little hole aint it...
Imagine when he comes to sell the house
But where was the source of the draft?
Abrasive tools would be fairly good for low noise. As in, they grind away the rock instead of pounding it away. An angle grinder is though a bit fast and makes a lot of noise from its gears alone... But the noise it makes from cutting it actually fairly small since it has no real impacts during operation. And the neighbors are likely used to the sound of the angle grinder to be fair.  How well grinding scores into the rock to extract bits is, or how fast such digging is, I have no clue. But if you put up some sound deadening material on the walls, then it would likely be fairly quiet outside of the shed.
"secret" tunnel...
Make sure to have proper ventilation while digging so any heavier than air gasses don't get stuck down there
You don't have a moisture problem in that bunker?
I wonder how planning permission for these kind of shenanigans works.
minecraft rtx off
Why not dig on an incline, and make the entrance last? This seems unnecessarily difficult.
colin I dug through sewer pipes
you know that shortening the shovel. will make you exert more energy.
Furzeshank Redemption…..
2days in underground challenge
As we get deeper it gets harder. -colinfurze 2021
Mate, if you needed to borrow a wheelbarrow, you should have just said so!
I aspire to be as wacky and amazing as Colin. he's just too cool.
Can't wait to see finished project
Colin just know the future and make youtube money at the same time as preparing for the apocalypse he saw.
Sorry, you didn't work on this during lock down??? The perfect time to work on it...
Ah, so the hydrolic pump wasn't just for the press. It was also for a shovel.
now all of china knows you're here
If he keeps digging straight down he's going to fall into a lava pit
I'm going to be honest, I've never been this excited about a youtube project. This is basically my childhood dream (along with the backyard bunker). I literally cannot wait for the next episode and to see the final thing. So freakin' cool, and so jealous! Great work!
Коля, тебе бы сходить на канал Самолелкин, поучиться как нужно копать)))
Awesomeness 👍👍👍
Dude’s been making this thing under our freakin noses
Neighbor watches video:  🧐”  I KNEW he didn’t play the trombone!!!  “
The best project ever. Collin has ball bigger than england.
"secret"?????
Should have made and electric wheel barrow build right before this one
When I saw the video of you making the bunker I thought is he going to make a tunnel to the shed and house And here we are he is building a tunnel
It needs guts and will power .... A great workout though....
#minecraft XD
i have never seen someone digging while wearing tie
A earth auger might have worked out better for you Colin
now you can see how impossible are those "huge houses made with a stick nature videos
Теперь он не секретный)  Now it's not secret)
If you ever sell that house I swear the next owner will just no know what to do with themselves
I thought he was playing minecraft
Waiting for the DIY tunnel bore reveal
This would've been a lot faster with a Diamond Pickaxe + Efficiency V + Haste II beacon
The only youtuber whom I don't mind having all caps titles
Your neighbours must love you! Can’t imagine what the rightmove listing is gonna be like when you move on and sell this house- 3 beds, 2 baths, a tie fighter and 1 underground bunker with tunnel access to property!
Lol, Ur neibours much fucking hate U! Hahaha
I'am diggin this! - Colin says.
Ho chi minh  trail activated
OK, so "Tom" is going in there. Where are "Dick" & "Harry" going. Shame Charles Bronson's not still around to help out.
I'm Very concerned that he will get stuck in there, and not upload part 3
This person is already survive when zombie is arive hahaha . Cool
Next up freeing Pablo Escobar by digging a tunnel
The Furze Entrenching tool. I love it!
how does the city give you planning permission for all of this haha cant even get my own decking XD
quick before the hyena comes!
Should of used a convauer pelt to get all the dirt out
Теперь он не секретный)
I can't really talk a I can't really talk your kid tries to do the same thing hit the water main and then just gets blasted by water or the tunnel collapses on them and they dying horrible death
suburban technology
Build a conveyor belts
Kinda surprised you didn’t use the opportunity to build a conveyor belt to move the dirt.
Have you undermined the Council Permitted development department?
you could even build a teleguided bucket
I can't believe you've had this in your back pocket. You are super human sir. Cheers.
This man made the jack hammer from rust and didn't even know it
Make longer vids please
Just stick some foam panels on the walls or something. Also you are in a deep hole in a shed I don't think it's going to be loud enough to bother any normal person.

It's not a secret if you post a video that thousand people watch it..
The fact that isn't a secret
Dude... You know there's machines to do this kinda job...? My back hurts watching this! 😂
My guy just place a beacon

Alguien mas mira los videos de este loco desde Argentina ?? 😂😂
(El Chapo has entered the chat)
My 4 kids and I love this series. Can't wait for the next one. Excellent Great Escape references. Keep it coming Colin.
Your Product Placement is really funny, i have no problems watching it. No need to skip, like "Varions" Product Placement. I like it, keep it up Colin.
PLEASE BE SAFE, CRAZYASS! T_T I don't want that crap caving in on you. 😭
I ACTUALLY CANT WAIT FOR THE NEXT ONE!!! SOO EXCITED MANNN!
Did you pull permits for this project?
Is anyone else wondering what projects Colin is doing that either haven't been finished (yet) or don't make the cut?
I feel like that hydraulic machine could be something used by Arsenio Lupin III
Colin, question, have you got planning permission from the council?
not so secret
Minecraft in real life
Love your work mate,  can't wait too see the finished product
This would not be possible in Germany, you'd need a Baugenehmigung (Permit)...
Wont this compromise your house's foundation?
Ladykillers fantasticalness 👍
Bri‘ish?
Do you have to worry about water on the tunnel?
Ladies and gentlemen, girls and boys, Please don't dig down more than four or five feet without supporting the sides, a collapse can be very serious. Colin was OK because he hit rock early.
Maybe build your own Tunnel Boring Machine?
What no auto digger invention?
Not really a secret anymore…..
fucking cool
Colins nephew doesnt realize how cool his uncle is
I thought it was Minecraft
Wanna see a conveyorbelt system for the dirt transport. No buckets! More power!
Love this 👍
I would have had way more wall supports, because I would be terrified of s cave in! I hope ground radiation isn't a problem in the area...
I hope you explain in future videos how you determined the depth in relationship to the tunnel's destinations. Damn, this tunnel is a lot of work
Did not expect a Great Escape reference, though I will admit to having it on my mind the entire time I was watching!
interesting
this is fucking mental
holy shit
Seeing how much dirt and how loud digging is, you have to appreciate those that dug tunnels out of Nazi concentration camps.
How did you get a permit for this lol
INCRIVEL
Living the dreams...
Just 2 distinguished guys in suits digging a hole ha ha, cant wait too see the progress Colin 😀
Imagen you Buy Some kellogs and Then there Is dirt inside
Cooler now 3 days
if theres ever a national emergency colin, can i have permission to stay safe in your bunker lol
Real life minecraft. The great scape reference is a good touch.
Great shit!
It's a bit like watching Wallace and Grommet but more fun. 👍
This may be the most effort ever put into a YouTube  vid
looks like escobars tunnel XD
Part3 please I can't wait
So wher can i find the plans for HydroForming with a Pressure Washer-PULSE JET?
Your neighbours must be getting rewarded for tolerating this madness... How they haven't taken out an ASB injunction against you is boyond me...
Let's build a secret tunnel! Let's post this online! No this won't compromise the meaning of 'secret' despite the fact of 167K people knowing about my tunnel. Brilliant! Also, nice not-so-secret-anymore tunnel
AWESOME!!! THIS IS SOME REAL STUFF MAHN..... MIND BLOWN.
That crack in the stone was pretty interesting.
Quá tuyệt vời
I hope you have a geotechnical and structural engineer on retainer. I’ll pray for you!
how can your videos be so good??? HAHAHHAHAHAHHHAAAHHA love ya!
❤️
I dread to think of all the paperwork required to make something like this?! How on (under?) earth?
Not really a secret tunnel when you upload it to youtube huh 😂
Should just make a hydraulic auger
Dig a Hole..
"we are down to maximum depth" bro he reached bedrock
But, where was the draft coming from?
surprised you didnt use a conveyor system
Real-life Minecraft. But you have broken rule nr 1: Never dig straight down. But also- "Making secret tunnel to my secret bunker"- then put all of that on the internet for everyone to see.
Colin must be the only person in the world, who invents weapons of doom. Only to remove dirt 😂
So that’s how he does his hair! That’s been bugging me for years!
Thanks for the cheeky free six quid Colin 👌
MOREEEE
Yes mate, watch Pt1 about an hour ago :D
I have been thinking in the same lines to do tunneling and excavation in small spaces but i have been thinking in a bucket wheel digging thing that can excavate under houses or make tunnels. Contiuosly with belts and lifts for transport of soil.
I cant dig 3 inches down in my backyard without hitti g water
Shovel length your biggest problem, huh, my entire part of the country is rock.
This is really cool to see! Can't wait for the final results!!
Why dont he build a wheel barrow.. or better a conveyor belt to displace all that soil
YES! JUST IN TIME FOR MY LUNCH BREAK AT WORK!!!! wooooooooo!
thanks for the freetrade logo in the left top corner, so it was easily skippable. THX mate
I have no idea what this does with the resell value of your house, it either skyrocketed or plummeted
Add a pump to deal with potential flooding? Too bad you can't just bring 16 water buckets
Back pain has entered the chat
If I was younger, you would be the person I wanted to be when I would be a grown up.
i am finally early, :D
Define secret.
SECRET TUNELLLL!!! SECRET TUNELLL! SECRET SECRET SECRET SECRET T U N N N E L L L L!!!!!!! yea.
Not really a secret if you put it on YouTube...........
Why dont you dig the tunnel not that high and build a railway with a cart to the bunker and lie down
SECRET TUNNEL SECRET TUNNEL THROUGH THE MOUNTAIN SECRET TUNNEL
Colin is like a comic villan 😂😂. It is like he has the brain of evil doctor 😂😂
It’s not that secret
Building control has entered the chat.😂😂😂
He looks like ranboo
That lockdown montage was epic. The music made it.
I always thought Colin had a lot of balls, now I know he has cause he's has to lift the seat and the ring to get em in (5.41)
"Your Capitol is at risk" lol
not much of a SECRET  if we know about it
I admire how respectful you are to your neighbours. Waiting for them to go on vacation or being outside to make all the noise. Thats something extraordinary nowdays... My upstairs neighbour is so damn noisy at all times. Kudos to british society!
Every guys loves digging holes
Noice😁😁😁😁😎
What are the legalities of this project?
You should rent an auger to help break the dirt up
You must be built like the Rock after all that lifting 😲
Hydraulic tunneling machine build on the way?
I love how everything you could see popping up in his background was related to a secret project, like the hydraulic system and the winch mounted on the ceiling. I thought it was just the old winch from the mail shredder.
I was wondering what he was doing all those times with huge gaps between uploads. This definitely explains it. Talk about time consuming.  You should have made a digger on a track with an auger or electric conveyor belt with scoops on the rubber belt to carry away the dirt up the shaft. Then as the tunnel gets deeper you add sections of track and bends to go down the tunnel.  Then if it breaks and needs service then it can travel back into the shop for repair.
I love the multicolored tubs. haha
Ahh what an evil.
Thumbnail looks like phasmophobia
WAIT! Is it still a secret tunnel if thousands of people know about it?  Secret or not I want one lol
I think Colin's neighbours are probably more concerned how quiet it is
SECRET TUNNEL~ SECRET TUNNEL~ THROUGH THE MOUNTAINS~  https://youtu.be/4-GiYP_4qc0
he can survive anything also nuke also
>wants to avoid making too much noise  >Uses angle grinder...
Colin what in hell do your neighbors think when they see you leave your house with random dirt filled items 🤣
The way he talks about being quiet make it seem like he got in trouble with the neighbors in the past. Lol
Hydraulic elevator that acts as the door to the tunnel.
are you batman?
Waiting for the spin off of this concept. Tunnel My Property
Он погреб делает ?
You are bloody insane mate :D I LOVE IT! :D
Oh my gooood 😍😍😍 soo cool 😎😎😎
I got a free trade worth £7 🙄
dude so much work i can feel the blisters on the palms even from here.
1:38 demonetization.
Colin you're a madman
Very cool but why don't you used a micro bagger for the digging?
Is so secret a few million people have seen it online.
10:32 yes, where does it come?? No explanation..
Fun fact: colin just invented a way of playing minecraft irl!
Next video we build a nuclear luncher under my house
I think this just fits the definition of "mad lad" to a tee.
Luck finding some gold 🪙🪙🪙
He's just playing Minecraft in real life
I'm enjoying this series mainly because it's something I've often dreamed of doing. Also, the small chance that the next episode might be the one where you discover something Time Team would be proud of, keeps me coming back for more!
So... where did that crack leads to ?
Will you ever move house?
This is so cool 🤣 I want a bunker. Where's my shovel and cement
Well I would have gotten that freetrade  app but not available in the states
Leave it to you to make your ads interesting. Lol Not only are you funny and ambitious, but you're  incredibly talented.  THIS IS WHY YOU'RE THE BEST CHANNEL ON YOUTUBE.
What happend to the mini cave story!? 😢
Should make sure that the tunnel comes out on a door with the bunker, so that you don't have to climb more to get in or out of it, just walk from place to place thru the tunnel, then climb if you want out entirely
How many seconds did it take for Tom and you to change out of that stuffy suits?
Love the Great Escape reference.  I forgot about that movie until part 1 of this series.
Never thought Colin Furze would be the quiet kind of neighbor
Man I'm waiting for part 3
You're just the best colin....
I think 90 degree shovel would be easier
Honesty, I envy his child. They have one of the coolest dad ever.
you will fall into lava...
Are you on day rate or something Colin? 😉😆
Colin prepares for a zombie apocalypse when everyone else just watches.
What an absoulte bonkers project Colin, my hat goes off to you!
What do you think the real estate will be when he sells the house?
I would say it's not responsible of you to sponsor risky trading to your impulsive young crowd.
I like how he tags minecraft
Colin: makes a super secret tunnel   Also Colin: posts it online for millions of people to see
Hey Colin, just found your channel by watching this project part 1. Really interesting stuff! Keep digging and can't wait for part 3
I have to wonder why he doesn't just line the entire inside of his shed with sound dampening foam
I love the Great Escape reference. I was thinking about the Great escape in the first episode. Lol
You get to do all the cool stuff I wish I could afford. Ima live through your videos.
Colinfurze plays minecraft in real life
This will be the Colin Furze Youtube TUNNEL.
Be quite funny if you suddenly fell into an elites hide out!!🤣🤣🤣
At this point i think he gonna turn that into a smaller version of the tunnel rat
Tell me when you build a tunnel to Asia
haha the great escape scene brilliant 😂
I've never been excited before to watch a hole being dug
why dont you build some sort of scoop conveyor belt system all the way out to the skip ! cool build !
Someone has been watching hogan's heroes.
The perfect lockdown project 😄
Maybe you should dig a hole so you can bury the soil in it.
english VC HAHA
is this project going to include the addition to the bunker you talked about
can you immagine when it comes time to sell the house in about 30 years and there is massive system of bunkers, tunnels, automated robot assembly lines and a rocket escape pod hangar below the house. wonder how much that will add to the resell value.
This reminds me of the Irishman who went out metal detecting wearing his steel toe cap boots
Colin, with all of your YouTube/sponsor money, you could buy a house that doesn't have neighbors nearby to disturb... that way you can make all d noise you want! :D

I give it 7 more months until he reaches the United States!
He found a cave under his shed
You've got all those tools so just build a tunnel boring machine and be done with it.
SECRET TUNNELLLLLLLLLLLLLLL SECRET TUNNEEEEEEEELLLLL
Andy defrane used a chizel and his sheer determination to get through that wall.
Turns out his neighbors whatch his channel and know exactly what's going on
This could become your most popular project.
what if you hit a wire or pipe
I would advise sealing the walls or investing in a pump system, when digging tunnels, water can become a HUGE problem
Love this
This mans house value must go📈After every project
Are you preparing for german bombing
This monster, with the cereal boxes
Best video ever!!! I know you put tons of work in so props to you
Damn. That’s the most labor intensive piece of work a human can commit. And that is such a small space to work. I get backache from watching this video.
Mr Quatermass , your pit is ready!
I'm pretty sure if this man survive the nuclear apocalypse, it would take him only several month to rebuild society.
Not going to lie, thought you’d have made a motorised wheel barrow.
Such a crazy project but always professional!
Colin your like a minecraft redstoner automating literally everything
Amazing
Colin, first rule of minecraft is don't dig straight down!! What are you trying to fall into lava?
This is literally my favorite series on YouTube right now.  They can't come quick enough.
Too bad he only has an efficiency II  iron shovel
Peaky blinders tunnel vibes
Minecraft real life!...did you find diamonds?...
I love that you are actually considerate of your neighbors, move to texas and replace my neighbors plz
Here i got part 2
This is the type of video you know is gonna blow up in the internet!
A minute for the neighbors who see him happy digging a hole in his house wearing a suit  If it was me i shit my pants thinking his a hitman
One European lad using imperial measurements instead of metric
Colin, do you have a tool there called a "Ditch-Witch" here in the States?  It looks like a huge chainsaw on a wheeled vehicle and it's used to cut narrow trenches for gas, water, phone and other lines.  A (much) smaller version could be run by your hydraulic pump to cut your side access tunnel.
After building the tunnel he builds a secret bar next to the bunker and can drink secretly some alcohol 😂😂😂
Insane! Lovit!
Minecraft: Don't dig straight down! Colin: Fine, I'll do it in real life
Just imagine what this property will sell for in the future...
You must be a favorite of your local DPW
When you want to play minecraft vanilla in real life but you start to play with mods anyway
You'd think that he would use a diamond pickaxe after putting #minecraft.
hello
DIY nuclear bunker
It's not secret if you make YouTube video about it ...
It puts the lotion on its skin
1:40 that was the best movie reference I've seen in a long time
Fritzl Furze dungeon
4:00 reminds me of the wiseguys from Goodfellas that dug graves with their suits on🤣
I'm actually pretty surprised you're using buckets and haven't rigged up a conveyor.
Colin plays minecraft
I love how he tries his best to be a kind neighbour! :)
Mining is a risky business for professionals with actual mining equipment going through well surveyed, solid rock. Good luck, you'll need it.
I’ve never told 11 million people a secret
oh no the capitol is at risk
Hero.
5:17 new video ideA?
Shot crete would help stabalise walls with mesh embede ? Yes no? Stay safe Bill from the UK
Hey Colin, I did too much digging in a crawl space in clay soil (like you have there). I found a little baby shovel (about 1 meter long) at the hardware store worked great in the confined space. The difference from your short shovel is you had a flat blade shovel, which is impossible to use in clay. Switch to a pointy "spade" shape and it's easier. Also, there's a 2 meter long solid steel pole with a wedge on the end that worked great. I bought both tools at Menards (a big home improvement store chain) in the US. The baby shovel didn't have a special name, but the heavy bar (the weight/momentum helps it penetrate the clay ... 16 to 18 lbs, or 8 kg) is called a  "post hole digging bar" or "pinch point bar". Both tools could help you going forward, if you can obtain them in the UK. Good luck! Looking forward to seeing how you tackle the challenges!
What if Colin ever wants to sell his house
You couldn't even go in your backyard during lockdown
Ummm...this isnt really secret any more if it ever was...
LMFAO, the timing of the trumpet with Tom's digging... 😂
look for a while now and this is really lol go on grts FROM NL
what the heck did I just stumbled upon on this sacred YT ground..its funny tho :D
i know this is long finished and all, but please put a helmet on when you are in the hole, falling rocks are nothing to mess with!!
Its coming along
hey colin very good , suprised you have not built a tunnel boring machine , then when finshed leave it one end. love the great escape referances
He dont his neighbors to know about it but 11 million ppl on YT is ok.    lol.     Dude cracks me up!!
You complete and utter madman! That's fantastic! Can't wait to see where this tunnel literally goes.
“ could be a cave, That would save us a lot of digging “ 😂😂😂
I´m thinking you might be able to find the origin of that void by forcing in some smoke ?
Level of ingenuity: HITACHI Jack hammer!
Please use a helmet when digging a tunnel
This project is just F'in bonkers....... totally Colin Furze
That house is going to be unsalable when he finishes with all those stupid tunnels and bunkers.
Man this is really cool. I wonder what the legallity of this is.
wow. Hes been doing this for a whole year along with other projects without anyone of us even noticing something
"Secret"
colin is wrorried about making sound when digging but not when testing jet engines
How the hell is this legal in UK!!!??🤣🤣🤣
This is what autism looks like
See you in 2022 for part 3 lads
I dont know how to tell you this...... Posting your secret tunnel build on ytube kinda defeats the purpose.  But I cant wait to see it.
Some kind of crude conveyor belt made with a running machine it would be awesome for transporting rocks and dirt...
Cool
Next video : I fell into a cave and broke my legs, help !
You can use a rail system like the Mexican Drug Cartel uses to extract the dirt from your horizontal tunnel portion... I'm always thinking !!! LOL
I love how he isn't even wearing a helmet
#minecraft
What's maximum depth? Are you not allowed to go deeper? And when do you reach the batcave?
The hole reminds me of the ending of portal
Jesus loves you so much that he gave his life for you because you sinned against him, and you need a savior! Repent and trust in him and be saved! Have a good day:)
This man can do everything
I love how Colin's worried about people hearing him dig, when this is likely the most quiet he's been comparatively 😂
I really wonder how much these projects cost
if you dont have it build it
you're mad
Secret...
Looks like fun.  You might want the utilities to mark where they are when you start moving outward..  Be a bummer to hit a gas line...  Looking forward to see how it goes for you!
Jaime Lannister digging his way from under the Red Keep.
#minecraft
I wonder how patience inmate digging a tunnel with only limited time and tool
this further confirms that all boys just like digging holes, it makes us all happy
I assume he made sure to dig through his neighbors' internet cable before this
Cant believe he started this project so long ago and didnt say anything about it until now lol. He knew we.d be pushing him to finish it🤣
I can't believe you went that deep before shoring up your crazy lol great vid
This is easily the coolest project ever.
That's rather annoying because digging a big hole would have been an excellent lockdown project
I was waiting for the great escape reference.
Try to use electric drill
Love how genuinely excited he seems about this project. He's like a kid in a candy store more then ever before.
Its not a secret if you're telling 11 million people on the Internet about it...is it ?
It is like playing minecraft in real life.
Jokes aside - did you have to get any sort of planning permission for this? Have you looked at pipe diagrams etc to make sure you avoid any water ways or sewage etc?!
It's one thing to be doing something like this, it's another thing to do it mostly with a button down shirt and dress pants
..I guess safety ties are a thing in minecraft soon (or already)?
What is your neighbors are on YouTube, watching you, Your idea of secret (tunnel) is spoiled now.
I'm surprised you haven't (yet?) built a scale chunnel boring (digging) machine!
Dude my dog could dig that hole in 2 minutes. Just make sure you tell him not to dig and he’ll dig...
He's probably doing this in silence because of all the noise complaints from the neighbors.
It’s weird to know that Colin has had a secret tunnel door under his shed for the past few years, and we didn’t know whatsoever… wonder what else hes hiding? 🤔
What if your neightbours follow your youtube channel???? They will know even with all the "noise supression"
Mate's doin shit that we can only do in Minecraft what a lad
That was the best and funniest sponsored segment i've ever watched :)
Epic
Hey Colin, I downloaded and set-up Freetrade on the last episode. It takes 6 days to get your free share, but I did get £9 worth in a random company! :)
how is it secret if you posted a video of you building it
the thumbnail looks like a mine shaft
Someone tell him not to dig straight down or he will simply fall in lava...
I want a secret underground bunker, but I hate digging.  The neighbors might notice if I rent an excavator.  Suggestions?
5:33 is my favourite colin clip yet
The hole looks awesome! Can’t wait for Part Three!
Years ago I worked on a farm and when the silage unloader would get stuck, the service man used a  hydraulic digger to dig it loose. One of those would make your digging much easier.
i was actually expecting to see you come up with a boring machine that can push itself along and carve out a rectangular tunnel as it goes.  A frame of slow speed augers arranged in a rectangle that would allow you to know out the center of the tunnel
All fun and games until you discover a cave entrance and unleash evil upon the earth
Not much of a secret though. Let's build a secret bunker, tunnels and post it on the Internet so 11million people can see. lol
this video makes me wanna dig a underground mini facility under my house
I would switch to earth drills. You also need a simple way to move the earth, maybe lay down some tracks or build a simple tray on one side with an archimedes screw to move the earth back to the shaft.
COVID would’ve been the perfect excuse to just dig for a year straight to finish it
Wonder if hydraulic jaws would work better than a spike?  to late now ik,
can you say hi to me :)
imagine grabbing a box of cocopops and its full of dirt
😂 Don't dig a too deep hole, because you will fall out in Australia
Colin. If no one still told you: You´r totally nuts. Thank you for sharing with us.
This is fucking amazing lol.
Awww yeh, the quick release hydraulic system. Seems like that happened ages ago! I suppose this video did too 😂
This is fucking awesome!!
Amazing! I wish we could have basements here near Houston Texas but unfortunately you dig a few feet and you hit the water table.  Looking forward to the next video, good luck, and be safe!
do you pet a platypus? a green platypus?
This has to be your most awesome project yet, cant wait for the next vid!
This vid rocks! I’m really stoked to see how this turns out!
Where's the bloody homemade tunnel digger???? Lol
Why not using an electric soil drill Setup?
And whenever colin makes something he has to make a diffrent thing
I love how he keeps saying "secret" underground tunnel. They will never know. Who's gonna know? They're gonna know.
As you talked about spade and shovel are too long (see 2:45) - I thought about a .... a some more ... mechanized solution. :)
Not so secret
You obviously play '7 Days to Die'....
Colin is actually doing one of the things we all wanted to do as kids
So you're telling me... There has been a secret hole in your shop for over a year now!?! DAMN! I kept seeing that red winch system on the ceiling and wondering why its there. Now we know. Awesome project!
Use a drill planter
you might find a unexploded V2 Rocket
I envy this man. He has an awesome setup for when covid 19(the Dr. Fauci special edition comes out) and turns everyone who got the vaccine into zombies.
efficiency V diamond shovel
the crack...
It puts the lotion on it's skin or it gets the hose again
You need a miniature "chunnel" boring machine my old son! (By miniature, I mean "Furze-sized)
the next owners of that property are gonna have a few questions
He made that bunker for a reason back then
Imagine one day in the future when a senior Furze has had it with stairs and wants a single storey house. Real Estate Agent: So does your house have any special features, Mr Furze? Colin: uhh, a bunker, a tunnel, a paper shredder letter box, a 3 stage alarm bell system……
Madman with too much time
only once in a while there is a youtube project where I'm dying to wait for the next episode to be released... quite often this happens on this channel... come on, Colin... can'T leave us waitin here o.o
Remember to be safe when digging. Video is looking good
I wouldn't go around leaving suspicious bags about town on a regular basis if I was you.
"Secret"
The estate agent isn't going to know what's hit them when Colin comes to sell his house.
This dude is totally lonely inside believe me but he insists to do something extraordinary to escape it and he did it no one would ever do it . I LOVE THIS MAN WITH ALL MY HEART He has my RESPECT
Wow!!!! 70k views in half hour!!!👏👏👏👏🥳🥳🥳
Lets hope you neighbors don't know where you live when they see the video.
the only thing is that the music sounds like absolute hell
Not so secret is it
Now I want to dig a hole
From the USA…you are the MAN. Zombie apocalypse I’m paddling to your house for survival. I won’t take up much room I promise. Lol
You're a Madman!  😂👍
OMG let's goooooo!!!
It's not secret anymore 🤣🤣🤣
Colin is going a bit mad..... oh he already was, wasnt he
do you have to be quiet cos of noise complaints or are you being quiet to make it more mysterious? either way this is cool af
can't wait for the next part xD
Poor Tom lol
This is spinning knife belt level rediculous.
Petition for idea:  Colin should have the hatch to the tunnel open with and lock with a hydraulic.  Sign here       Or here |                             | v                            v
Who was that guy talking about the dirt in the socks? It sounded like David McCallum
This is huge!!!
I think it would be cool if he went way more into the specs of things and his thought process on why he is doing something the way he is. Like more educational, or even if he had a separate channel for the people that want to learn how he does all these cool things vs just watching him do stuff.
You DO know that recording yourself making a secret tunnel, it isn’t really secret anymore.
Most important question. Where did that crack lead to?
Whole of England knows that you are digging a hole in your garage upto your basement amd making a tunnel. You can keep the stealth part out of the videos. But yeah it looks funny tho.
What a legend that puts in the description #minecraft
His neighbors have no idea who is living next door ?
How can Colin say its a "secret tunnel" then make a video about said tunnel and post it for millions to watch...doesn't seem very secretive still super cool tho
imagine somewhere in that crack is a catacomb, with like lots of dead ppls, probbably skeletons all over the walls
13:34 he said that like Dr stone
And Im dreaming of a small shed...
Would a hydraulic auger not have been more effective for the digging?
I wish I could help you because one of my hobbys is actually digging deep holes. Just a few problems: COVID and I live in Germany...
This is absolutely the best project for a long time in this very tube channel.
You need to call AskJeffWilliams
Just as I was thinking you could use a pulley system for the buckets you make one
Furze is the mad scientist every kid dreamed of being in primary school, secret bunker, and now a secret tunnel to the secret bunker. you love to see it
DAMNIT I want to see part 3 now !!!!!! Thanks for this universal exciting men stuff... digging hole lmao
1:36 schmeat 😏
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34CZjsEI1yU
Let me guess you don't have an HOA...
...and suddenly now he's worried about the noise! I'm pretty sure it's par for the course with his neighbours.
no I'm thinking if you're digging a secret tunnel why are you telling everyone, I'm secretly planning to over throw the controllers am currently looking for event organiser
How will the foundation of the building will hold? I'm just curious. (Are you not partially damaging it?)
you are quite lucky that you live on a hill you had no water issues. My dad wanted a service pit in his massive gurage he built. We dug a meter down and water started coming in, went another meter and pit was flooded with water. We had to line it water tight plastic liner, brick wall with concrete behind it and then render the inside and some how water still came through.
Colin worried about noise is definitely something new here hahahaha You can see how serious this work is!
FREE-trade charges a monthly fee.
Somebody buy this man a wheelbarrow!
1:26 - What is the title of the movie?
Nice
Cool idea...but why just not make a huge drill or tunnel boring ??🤔
Colin, seriously, after years of weird sounds coming out of your workshop, do you think your neighbors would even stop to think about what that digging like sound is supposed to be?
Next:  Colin finds an unexploded WW2 bomb
Plot twist. The draft is coming from the neighbors secret tunnel they built the year before him
YES GREAT ESCAPE YOU ARE THE TUNNEL KING
Yes
started watching at 5k views. F5. its fucking 123k. wtf.
That pump going in shows just how long this has been going on for and that winch looks like the one from the paper shredder
The ColinFurze HOA war is inevitable
You think an auger would work better and faster?
all i can hear as i watch this is https://youtu.be/7o4EI_-5reA?t=64
totally epic project, love the dedication!
Imagine he found a cave he could make a bat cave
Dude, I'm sure no one has told u yet that you don't dig straight down, otherwise ur doomed if u mine down to a lava lake
faraday cage.  Very nice
Whenever I am watching one of these videos it feels kinda like watching Doctor Who except its a cool dude making stuff
If anyone ever says YouTube isn’t a real job just show them this video of colin digging a tunnel by himself in secret
What you are doing is EXTREMELY dangerous, if the walls were to cave in you would be dead within minutes. You should be shoring more incrementally than you are.
Quick question, and I havn't seen the first one. Uhm, would having a bunker, tunnel, and (if it still exists) retractable roof thing make the property value go up or down?
Part 2 of building the house from resident evil 7
Just imagine in 50 to 100 years when Collins dead someone buying this land and discovering all the cool things there are
this was filmed almost a year ago? edit 2 years ago
I cant get a permit to redo my bathroom and he can get one for a god damn nuke bunker
Love the great escape reference!
Colin - I’m Digging a secret tunnel. *shows 11 million people* 🤣
I'm just wondering what this lad's background is, did he learn all that stuff himself or if he's an engineer. I know for a fact that to do all that stupidly fun stuff you out to have some proper knowledge and skills.
12:11 ah, the ol safety squint
I follow you from Turkey. You are the best youtube channel in the world.
When you two were digging with the suits on it reminded me of the Mafi digging a 3ft hole for a body
I love how little background noise there is in the pit.
Nicee
Let me guess, the fun police will arrive soon and say 'Oh DOn'T Do ThIs, YOu DoN'T kNoW HOw DaNGeRoUs THIs iS!!!!111!'
5:44 My capitol is propably not at risk, except on January the 6th lol
Next video going sideways? Don't forget to take a left at Albuquerque or who knows where you might end up.
secret tunnel that 11 million people know about
I’m guessing Colin had to get planning permission for all this and I’m also guessing that in the planning it states he’s got to make no noise to upset the neighbours?
Perfect lockdown project :D
Fuk this guy live my dreams
Installing the Hydraulic pump?!? just made me realize how long this has been in the works!
Watching you dig with the wrong type of shovel is painful to watch.
So, when will he make a hydraulic auger to help tunnel to the bunker?
SECRET TUNNEL! 🎶 SECRET TUNNEL! 🎶  through the garden !🎶secret secret secret TUNNEL!
@collin dose free trade work for us American money or is it only use pounds
Minecraft😂😂😂
I'd love to know how the planning permission went, if needed ofc
I would give up digging after 5 minutes
You could say that tool that you made is a ground breaking invention
Wish I lived were you lived so I could help dig lol
I wish my local council allowed me to dig random tunnels and bunkers in my yard.
Im surprised there isn’t a cut sene of him watching ‘Digging with Dibnah’ 😂
I wondered when he would find a powered way to dig. Digging by hand is backbreaking work lol
So, how much does this devalue your property?
Do your neighbours not watch your channel?! Wouldnt they find out about your tunnel by watching this anyways?
How did you get a permit for that?
We're watching the birth of a future superhero or mad scientist underground lair.
you should hire el chapo’s man
Smh hes clearly using chisels and bits if only just used his hand or a shovel he would clear a 1m cube
Very hard project. I hope you will finish fast ;)
well i had a bigger hope.  thought you are going to to make a boring machine like ELON MUSK . in my opinion  colin and elon has same caliber and vision.
3:50 Look I know it's supposed to be "band practice", but come on: Colin Wick? John Furze?  Loving the silent challenge also 😂
You could dig with a shop vacuum!
this musics awful i miss march to tthe grave
SECRET TUNNEL SECRET TUNNEL
In this episode Furze breaks into the storm drain that runs under his house.
Don't tell me he left that dirt there
Spiders after a week: our hole
Everyone Gangsta till Colin builds a tunnel through his house.  I am looking forward to seeing how this will go and you might even find a treasure Good luck to the work and also be safe not to bump your head in the tunnel :)
This is probably my favorite project you've done so far. So sick!
realistic minecraft to the next level
OK. DIGGING A SECRET TUNNEL IN FRONT OF 11 MILLION SUBSCRIBERS. OK I AM DONE. :D
And then he finds some old tomb of some forgotten celtic royalty or a roman bath joint
How cool would it be if you built a miniature version of the hugh tunnel-boring machines 😄 If it is electric it would be silent too ^^
He's prepared
I can see why you don't want to disturb your neighbours and family with work. But damn covid slowed us all down.
I am not going to use a jackhammer as that make noise then processed to using a grinder?
Another great episode of Colin furze pimp my house
Hey colin just had my birthday yesterday keep being funny and making people feel better have a good day love your actsent
Fuckin brilliant mate 😌🔥👍
Just watching this is making my back hurt already
he could have used an dirt drill
coolest thing ever
Holy shit is that the guy from Slam by The Prodigy?
christ this is amazing
40s spoilers... My back... MY BACK!
I was waiting for this 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Man I would love to see this in person! There wouldn’t be a chance of seeing this next year when the wife and I are in the UK for our 25th anniversary?
Colin, Marty T and Matt of Diesel Creek all in one day, time for a beer.
Top work 👌 keep it up
He must wish he was in Minecraft. Maybe a diamond pick will help?
wow!
This whole project sounds like Colin's had one too many noise complaints from the neighbours so has had to resort to becoming a mole-man.
so awesome
4:43 Colin: "don't skip it!" Me: good idea, imma skip it!
LETS GO! The lockdown part was some really well done editing man.
This is the only person who entertains me
Should have built a vacuum system to transfer the dirt n rocks
colin has become the VC
Love from Kenya
Holly shit..  what a crazy project!
Minecraft be like
Two lovers, forbidden from one another  a war divides their people And a mountain divides them apart
"it puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again"
Would be amazing if he made a miniature boring machine haha
What a freaking ton of work...
What for of transportation will you use to go to the bunker with the tunnel? Surely you won't go there on foot!
This is Furze at his best, he just keeps raising the bar. Shout out to FreeTrade for making it possible!
dear lord that has to be the WORST varieties of soil to dig in.  packed stone with CLAY beneath it.
He really just put a box of dirt in the cereal aisle?! How dare you desecrate cereal like that
That could have been done in a day with Escobar team
Cannot wait for part 3
So I did some mining off camera...
4:00 Gotta admit you gents look pretty snazzy all dressed up.  Loving the vid, having a secret bunker with secret underground tunnels has been something that captured my imagination back as a kid, so seeing someone achieve the dream is amazing
The Mexican drug cartels will give you a ring to work for them, making tunnels under the us border....😅
How is this an expensive project? Because you bought two shovels from WWII era?
Secret tunnel  Secret tunnel  Through the garden  Secret secret secret secret tunnel!
I thought for sure you'd build a conveyor belt to move the dirt into a truck.
You're an absolute knob
Does your wife noticed it ? Did you every time close the carpet when she was coming ? 😂😂😂😂
in such tight confines I would have suggested either a post hole spade (that are like a big set of tweezers) or a post hole auger. keep up the good work
Nice hair cut...make u look more young 😁👍
So cool man i love your videos
I'm more surprised he is able to get council approval or managed to keep it a secret from them?
llefgue
I'm sure, Colin already had hydraulics or was this project started that long ago that he didnt
@colinfurze. dig a tunnel and make Scotland pay for it. What?
Daily struggle at 1:47 Edit ( closing the cereal box )
So what was the crack and why was it letting a breeze through? I would have done something stupid like holding a lighter near it
You are absolutely amazing person!
I was hoping that air vent crack would have led to a tunnel one of the previous owners would have made in order to get to their secret bunker at the other end of your yard and you wind up with two secret bunkers!!!
This gives new perspective to the Gents who dug the tunnels for the Great Escape using spoons
Love this project.
Colin Furze needs to be in the James Bond movies!
I am getting tired watching you lift this dirt out the prisoners in the great escape!
This is like a Minecraft in real life kinda vibe.
Is it just me or has he already fitted that hydraulic pump before in a previous Colin furze video because when he was making his normal hand pump press into a hydraulic press I remember him talking about the Christmas tree
The difference between Colinfurze and anybody else is that anybody would have given up during dig #1.
Colin, you live in the UK. You need a license for your license for your shovel. There must've been LUDICROUS amounts of planning approval to go digging under residential space. It's not exactly secret when the local government approved it, is it?
This is like minecraft in real life lol.
Заебись прокопал😂
Love the respect he has for his neighbors
it looks like a madman's secret hide out, wait
Minecraft bases be like
What with the project that Syndicate's been doing and this too, I feel like Christmas has come early or something.
Not really a secret now is it?
Wish I live down the street I'd sweat blood for ya bro
SECRET TUNNEL  SECRET TUNNEL  THROUGH THE MOUNTAINS  SECRET SECRET SECRET SECRET TUNNEL!!!!!!!
Well not so secret anymore :P
Collin spends more noise making his tool adaptions than he does digging
If I was to do this at home what permissions do I need in the UK please? About to build a pond but a tunnel seems more fun!
I'm so keen to see where this goes next, and how you plan on securing the ceiling and the kinda supports you plan on putting in to stop a sink whole, and flooding.
El chapo furze
You made a GIT (Ground Engagement Tool)
Should use the petrol wheel borrow ha-ha
I love it man!  You inspire me
Nice shaft Colin.  God damn. Everthing i say sounds wrong. Wash my mind.
When lockdown hit us in the UK, March 2020 we now know who had the most EPIC home project
i think he know´s stuff that we shouldn't know
After watching the ad, I found it quite funny to read that my capitol could be at risk... I didn't know I had a capitol in my back yard!
This is fkn incredible. Every little boys dream
Bike wheel with teeth on a motor
A Steve would only need 3 seconds for this
not very secret mate, on account of you documenting it on the internet and all...
Unfortunately after spending the last few years renovating, building an extension and this last weekend I shifted 30 ton of soil from my garden I can't enjoy this project at all. All I'm thinking is "That looks hard work", and you're making my back ache!
my dude built an underground railroad to escape to his builds. what a legend.
Colin I’m up in north Lincolnshire do you think you can build a tunnel up to here to
I just finished watching Better Call Saul this week, and this is totally reminding me of the German guys building the underground lab.
If a so cool
Love the Great Escape reference, awesome movie.
Oooo my neighbor is digging a tunel, I gess we all have our own techniques not to go mad during COVD.
not realy a secret anymore
I love how he adds minecraft as his hashtag
If you can hide this from us what do you hide from your wife lol
Where did that crack lead? What was it in the end?
Brave man putting a hole in the house haha
Its not really a secret tunnel when you make a YouTube video about it
He really enjoy his life
the people in the uk sure come up whith some crazy ideas
Wait so why was that crack in the hole there anyway
I like how it's #minecraft
when 11.000.000 people know , i dont think its still a secret tunnel but just a tunnel :p
I love this
So you reshowed us the hydraulic pump that you installed a while back?
Yes
Please tell me you're going to build a Brunel inspired Tunnel digging machine!
There's nothing quite like watching a madman in action.
Never seems to matter, no matter how inventive you are, no matter how clever you are, no matter how creative you are, "men still dig holes with shovels"...
imagine he really put all that dirt at those places
Colin: *secret tunnel* Also Colin: “now let’s show some million people”
What if he breaks the toilet pipe
I just admire the fact that you did this for so long without leaking any information about it. I would start to tell it to everyone in two weeks.
Smarter eveyday and mark Rober and u need too all make a project together
I know how much I am willing to dig you are exceeding my willingness.
Imagine the real estate value increase once this project is finished. Are you allowed to further explore that cave draught? Might actually lead to a cave system.
Amazing
WHERE DOES THAT CRACK GO. I need to know
The fact that he makes it so tidious to stay silent because it's a "secret tunnel" while posting it on a 11M channel is hilarious
As someone in the demolition/groundwork game I know how much those buckets of rubble can weigh… good shout on the winch
If I tried this at home I'd drown.  The water table is just three feet below ground level.   But what an epic project!
How the he'll does he get planning permission.
See...you just need a "public" steam engine project in the back garden. Classic Fulton engine that knocks and bangs. Call it an educational project for your son! That will cover up the noise of the dig!
I Would Like A Mixed Playlist Of Classic Rock Music... Call IT : Furze On The BONE (W/Colin Blastin' It Out On The Ol' TromBONE)
This is such a cool project! Can't wait to see the final product.
1 hour comment
Amazing! Going sideways is gonna be interesting.
if you had a minecraft shovel you could do the whole thing an hour
Rock and stone!
Just watching this hurts my back
Why does it matter if the neighbors hear anything?
Love this mini series!
Give an engineer enough free time and this is what they become… THE BEST THING ON THE INTERNET!!!!  FURZE FURZE FURZE FURZE
Next video "colinfurze Making a tunnel boring machine "
the thing Colin wishes hed invented before starting the tunnel:  a Furze boring machine
It’s not so secrete anymore
He has spent years making an epic series for us. Haha that’s awesome
Only on the Colin Furze channel🔥
Hopefully your enemies that this is secret too dont watch youtube.
Dont you just love when colin just builds a hydrophilic pump to mine
Not so secret anymore Colin ;)
You make it look so hard next to those Cambodian guys who build pools in the jungle. I guess they just hide the amount of work it takes.
this man is if Phineas from Phineas and Ferb was a real person that just so happened to be british
wait, MIDDLE OF SEPTEMBER?
Anyone else want Colin to see how far he can dig down now 🤣
Wonder how much all the hidden modifications will benefit the property's value. Should have an appraisal done after finalisations haha
Where was the draft coming from???
So when does Stamford's tube station open?
You should so go meet Guy Martin, he'll be well keen to see your welding lol
You know Screwfix sell confined space shovels?
Colin is the perfect example of chaotic neutral
Wow this tunnel is so secret that colin shared it with the whole internet  But it's still pretty cool even tho its not sercret
The other guy is just hilarious. Could easily get an Oscar ... or the British equivalent thereof - for acting as the main villain in a new Guy Ritchie movie. That said... the fact the hinges aren't embedded in the metal, thus causing height differences in the carpet - just irks me. Anyway. Cool project, keep'em comin and greetings from Latvia. Edited: also, why aren't there concrete lining being poured in on the walls of the shaft? Weld some threaded bars on to the metal frame that's already there, measure HDF or other plate material (thick veneer, DSP etc) and drill holes in it, assemble the inner formwork out of it (cover the threaded rod holes with large washers and sealing foam) and fix it in place with nuts, seal any cracks with construction foam, pour in the concrete, wait for 10 days (water the concrete daily in the meantime), screw off the nuts, remove the formwork, and voila - the risk the tunnel will start shedding inner skin with time (ie, lose material from walls/sink the sides in, etc, etc) is eliminated, plus everything looking much neater and more "pro". There you go, no need to thank me.
He needs to put a elevator in it that would be cool
Can see people reading local Planning applications  “Mr C Furze: excavation and tunnelling under property to connect main dwelling to sub-terrain dwelling located in garden”  Eh??!!
You sir are fascinating to watch !! I have been watching since day 1
Turning the internet up to 11 since 2006 - I agree with that!
THAT'S MINING IN COLIN STYLE😁
Pov: you didnt upload a vid for 0.0001 seconds: -*R u DeD* -*u r ded? Cuz u dont uplood vids*
Hard hats ...
that looks like great clay bearing soil. make some clay and make some pots from your own clay
4:56 more people should Hoover their hair, under-utilised bit of equipment for dead scalp removal.
This is insane!         I LOVE IT!!!
Why mesh on the walls instead of sheet metal
So Furze, what did you do during lockdown? Colin: I played minecraft.
WOW
Colin: I am hearing loud music so no body knows that I am digging a tunnel and I will upload it to my YouTube channel with 11 Millon subscribers 😂😂😂
Anyone who skipped the promotion really missed out on the biscuit tin
Absolute madlad
I love watching Colin furze dog a hole
This isn’t so secret anymore, you’re too famous now
Thats a secret tunnel from shed to secret bunker that only the entire internet know about
Need to get an aguer to lose Then shovel
Nice tunnel
Awesome Colin! Love it!
Dude, you're living like everybody's childhood dreams. Let's make a tunnel everyone once in their livetime have thought. You just do it in your backyard. You must have a hell of a good way to threat the misses for you to get approval of this ;)
What happened to the crack?
Colin you were in a Mr beast video. its on Mr beast reacts and it is called inside of an ice cream factory
I love the great escape reference
No plans to move house any time soon then, Colin?
You’re gonna have to make an automatic carpet mover so you can open the trapdoor from inside
v
it's not so secret anymore😢
Colin you were in a Mr beast video. its on Mr beast reacts and it is called inside of an ice cream factory
Couldn't you just invent a TBM or something?
this is IMMENSE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Colin you were in a Mr beast video. its on Mr beast reacts and it is called inside of an ice cream factory
I appreciate the hard work and that you've already been working on this for 15 months
If those walls collapse there is no way anyone could reach you in time and you would just die. Pretty awful way to got and pretty stupid tbh, sorry
Colin you were in a Mr beast video. its on Mr beast reacts and it is called inside of an ice cream factory
You should NEVER have built a bunker with only one entrance in the first place .  I think you are smarter than that and that this is at LEAST the THIRD tunnel to it.
Colin you were in a Mr beast video. its on Mr beast reacts and it is called inside of an ice cream factory
#minecraft
Super!
Colin you were in a Mr beast video. its on Mr beast reacts and it is called inside of an ice cream factory
Colin you were in a Mr beast video. its on Mr beast reacts and it is called inside of an ice cream factory
Headline "Domestic Eco-Terrorist Leaving Dirt Strewn amongst England"
You could make conveyor belt with bike chain for dirt to big container outside. Buckets glued to conveyor
why digging a tunnel by your self  when you can make a digging machine
This guy is playing minecraft in real life.
Who needs a gym when you can just build yourself a tunnel!
I hope this isn't a Josef Fritzl situation.
This explains why my coco pops taste grittier than usual.
That crack you mention at 10:50 in the video is going to be a problem for you.  Unless you figure out where it enters you likely have a source for water to enter you tunnel.
The winch has strong "it puts the lotion in basket or else it gets the hose again" vibes
Secret tunnel!  Secret tunnel!  Through the mountain!
I feel lied to and betrayed. I thought the idea of having a shed mounted hydraulic system was genius. It turns out you were up to no good the whole time!
Has this project been going as long as you had the hydraulic system installed in the shed?! I thought i had a deja vû seeing the "clean up excuse" and the xmas tree
Government; ,"You can't avoid covid".  Also Collin;
Where I live, the ground is made of tough clay. Digging down to the limestone layer is extremely difficult. And I don't have all the tens of thousands of dollars of hardware Colin does.
Does all that need planning permission?
Colin - You otter dig the backyard first with a Ditch Witch or similar, making a trench, then you'd be working from the bottom and removing dirt sideways.
🤩
Colin, was you sat directly on the porcelain?
Woo hoo Colin I was wachin g you at school because I got board and what's boring about Colin nothing!!!!!
Needs more dynamite
Been too long since your plumbing apprenticeship so you decided to dig a hole to remember the good ol days?
Love this channel and all the content it produces you are basically building my dream house/property
OW MY BACK .... That's all I can say :)
I'd think the neighbors would be more suspicious of Colin NOT making lots of noise.
Out of curiosity, why the shovel and not a hydraulic powered earth drill? Could have saved a lot of effort moving the mud up...
I remember Fred dibnah sink a mine shaft long ago. I wonder if you have a national archive contact?  Digging for victory Colin? Good stuff. Hope the council are ok with you.
Starting such a great enterprise can only play with infinite courage, all my compliments.
Excellent methods to dispose of the dirt, but somehow I expected Colin to come up with some kind of giant hand-held "end mill" installed in a giant vacuum that uses the auger to transport the dirt away ... would need a flexible auger in the flexible hose, but could work.
Bunkers to some seemed crazy last year ..now he's in the lead and your all jealous...
Tom’s pretty handy on that trumpet, should pursue a career in it 🎺.
When Elon get bored and he did the tunnel digging too.
Everybody gangsta till Colin starts speaking Vietnamese in the tunnel
7:26... Ever felt like de ja vu?
The Council: "I'm not sure this is what permitted development means Colin"
I don't know if they make these anymore but maybe Colin could've bought an old military shovel that was used for digging trenches? I'm thinking World War era. Either that or a shovel used by a locomotive fireman.
I am soo hyped for this
He just built his own equipment lol
I just got a letter filled with dirt. Weird...
FInds "Hidden cave"..., getting strong Batman Beginns vibes.
imagine when Colin sells his house and people come to see it, "Here we have the underground tunnels!"
What are they doing in the roof, Roger allowed them to put the dirt into the roof
Well it's not secret as everyone on the internet has seen it
Throw a smoke bomb into the crack then cover up the hole and see where the smoke comes from the ground!
Trust me your neighbors know you are digging a tunnel in there... They probably even started using Free Trade when they saw the first video.
Anyone know what the music is at 12:16? thanks
Damm i was also wondering about the jet engine  :D
The framing on the wall gave me flashbacks to the beach hut build but without the collapses
Hello
Заебись бункер Сталина хуярит мужик
Crazed British man digs hole
"secret tunnel" posts video showing exact location on youtube
Colin is a mad scientist. Let’s just hope he doesn’t use his powers for evil…
I’ve noticed news pundits all sit in front of book cases but they never read the books, have you ever considered making a book case book ejector, that fires books out of the case allowing you to read loads of books
the mandatory meme: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-GiYP_4qc0
Look at this freakin dedication man. Can't wait for pt3
You are the best!! 😎Please subtitles in spanish🙏
Woah, that hydraulic system placement was in another video, this really is a very long project
SECRET TUNNEEEL! 🎶
Should have dug it nearer Xmas then could have sung Xmas carols to cover the digging 😂 and wasn’t Colin the forger? Danny was the tunnel man
My capitol is at risk? Is that a threat?
I just love the idea that Colin can never move house now. Imagine the listing though if he did...
Yes let's go bin waiting for this one 😆
Another amazing video you legend🔥 so much respect for how much hard work and dedication must’ve gone into this
It's all fun and games until you hit lava and burn to death.
If I did this in my home I would be fined a billion dollars
Time to break out the explosives.
Are you calling the tunnel "Charlie"?
P.S. Colin I love the new design for the bunker I might even make my own one day, but for now one can dream, one can dream.
This is so cool!!!
Eventually, he will reach China!
It’s amazing, Colin builds more inventions to help his current project. how can a man be so smart.
El chapo: *salivating.. get me that man Servant: but sir!
Ahahaha I'd probably hit a mains sewer, brilliant !
Why is there the #minecraft though?^^
This is the best project ever.
So basically at such speed Colin maybe till his pension will finish this tunnel build...
You can buy short spades you know 🤣
You are gonna get a lot of noice complaints
♪ Diggy Diggy Hole https://youtu.be/ytWz0qVvBZ0
Sponsor's offer not available in my location (Central Europe) :(
Will we ever hear Colin throw his hands up in the air and sing "SECRET TUNNEL!" at the top of his voice?
That's brutal man. Iv personally done a lot of digging for my shop and Blacksmith shop.
We can't wait for ep3
soooooooooo goooooooooood
Minecraft IRL 😂
3:11 this is the first "voilà" pronounced by a non french youtuber that sounded correct and not making him really dumb x)
Episode 378 - Still digging... had to purchase another family minivan to hide the dirt in! That’s the fourth on this month!!
careful with the underground cave! it could have built up a ton of radon
crazy man
Colin channeling Honeydew but in real life
Go colin
Dirt in a coco pops carton  That's bound to end poorly
Why you didn't make a rail to move the dirt outside?
If you find buried treasure on your property, remember to report it to the British govt or go to jail. LOL
When I was growing up on the farm we used to hay and put the Hay in the upper part of the barn using a conveyer belt.  Hookup a conveyer belt system and just have the dirt brought out that way.  Then when you get piles of dirt you can either sell it or give it away on craigslist or Facebook.  People are always looking for "Clean Fill."
I dont know why anyone would want to, but he, his kids and other descendants will never be able to sell this house if they dont want to answer a lot of weird questions. Not just because of a tunnel but also all the other "improvements" he built throughout the years
This man is NEVER going to sell his house.
An Auger dumping onto a neumatic conveyor belt might help.?
Man I am so excited for your next videos , Love your videos and your ideas 😎😎😎😁
Life is so easy in Minecraft
What about getting your neighbors to help you? 😁 you could make all the noise you want and some extra hands
The Furze cave! This is awesome
Secret tunel!!! Epice!!!!
He is sneakily hiding the dirt when he could just go to a bike park, find someone with a nice bike and ask them to take it and they probably would
I didn't find the treasure?!
Watch out and keep safety standards high when digging tunnels! A friend of my dad died digging a tunnel. The tunnel collapsed and he was dead before the firefighters could dig him out!
It looks great man! I like how you use mesh on the sidewalls instead of sheet metal, it gives it a really nice tunnelfeeling when the dirt is visible.
These videos are more inpatient then sleep
Something something ohmashu something something lovers something something SECRET TUNNNNNNEEEEEEEEELLLLLLLL
#minecraft heh? Please explain
Colin this is Awesome! Can't wait for the next part! But in all seriousness be safe my dude ✌
♪♪ SECRET TUNNEEEEELL♪♪
When this is done you should try digging as deep as you can.
I can understand that newer people need to get up to speed, but old fans of the channel knew you had the hydraulic pump under the worktop from the hydraulic claws/press video. New fans, go watch old vids, they're freaking great!!!
Dude, when is Lincoln Electric going to sponsor you? If they deny you, swap to Fronius!
Dig a tunnel, dig dig a tunnel.....
wait a second... there was almoast a year where you couldnt go anywhere and you are telling me you didnt use that for digging? whats the secret project youve been working on instead?
Can you imagine Colin's neighbours, what the hell is that maniac next door building now ? He is not normally this quiet, should we ring the council ??
how cool is that please
El Chapo want's to meet you.
This is crazy! Cant wait for the next episode!!!
to fix the noise problem put a tun of foam on the hatch to reduce the noise
SONG 12:15 - 12:50 ???
Do you have the recording of the building inspector laughing at you when you tried to pull the permit for this?
Got a bit of deja vu when he installed that hydraulic pump for some reason
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K74KJsUwGp4  You're welcome...
I love the music, felt so appropriate
Does doing all this increase the value of your property?
Are you gonna gunite/shotcrete your steel and mesh?
I hear the Channel Tunnel diggers have a few machines  spare doing nothing
It puts the lotion in the basket.
I cant wait to see the finished result its guna be so cool
spending all this time to make sure the neighbors don’t hear, what happens when they watch the video??? lmao
Soo coool
Cool
Fully living the dream at this point Colin, great stuff
I wish Colin could be my dad or uncle. Because this is exactly how the most cool dad/uncle on the planet looks like.
i really want to know here did the hole he find go to ?
and after this project he will start mining from the bunker under the garden for diamonds
Colin, I would recomend you checking out pulley systems, maybie it will help you someday when the motor won't be able to handle weight.
There's something about digging a big hole that's extremely entertaining lol.
Stretching this content out a but huh? You could have put the last two videos in one, your content is usually A+.
The absolute will of this man is unbelievable
Is it not gonna rot out
I skipped that bit again🤣🤣🤣🤣
Colin is slowly turning the channel into making staff out of dirt, like those Indian guys.
how bored are you mate
Now a elevator would be perfect
I'd pay if you said this... "See all of the episodes right now for $9.99"  The wait is killing me lol
Im really digging your tunnel
the tumbnail looks like minecraft lol
Having some experience in this. You must shore up the sides of the hole. Because the first time it rains the sides will collapse. And if you're in there when it dues you will be dead before anyone can help you.   Edit. It's good you realized you cribbing it but it should be done in any hole deeper than 4 feet.
Can’t tell if it’s a joke that Colin doesn’t want people hearing or if it’s because he won’t have planning permission so is doing it on the secret
Colin is playing Minecraft irl
love the vids looking forward to every one of them and cant wait to see you finish this project absoulutley killing it keep it up <3
You cheeky bugger that’s why you put the hydraulic system in. You really are one kick ass dude!Can’t wait to see the next episode
Colin! You should make a treehouse or something like that. I think that would be really interesting to see. And because you are you, you would probably end up putting flamethrowers on it or something
So worried about noise but i bet the neighbours are getting awfully suspicious about how quiet it is at the furze house.
* SPOILER *                    COLIN DIES IN PART 3 TRIED TO SWIM IN LAVA Tom takes over the channel
First minecraft rule never dig straight down
Two videos of a man digging - and somehow Colin still makes it entertaining
Chapo did it with a spoon
I wonder, does dirt count as littering 😕?
I'm just curious about planning permission because it seems my neighbours can't even build an extension for some reason 🤷🏻‍♂️
Build a conveyor belt to Transport the Rocks outside @colinfurze
Not much of a secret really.
When I see a new video uploaded I am so fast to click it 👍👍
Underground Slip'nslide?
Should borrow TBM from the Boring company :D
*Starts singing*  Dig a tunnel, dig dig a tunnel When you're done, you dig a bigger tunnel Dig a tunnel, dig dig a tunnel Quick before the hyena come!  *Stops singing* Ok I leave now
Amazing
Hi half expected you finding some chocolate gold coins.. 🤔😂🤪
This guy is a proper sapper.
If there is a zombie apocalypse please let us your subscribers come help you with projects for survival we need your brains we can labour for u to build an area to live in and survive
I’m excited to see the finished tunnel. Can’t wait for the next episode.😁😁😁
Use a big industrial vacuum cleaner. To suck up all the dirt and clay to the surface. Add extension hooses as needed. You can also make automated emptying of the dirt into an container
Sing it with me: Two lovers, forbidden from one another   A war divides their people  And a mountain divides them apart   Built a path to be together  ...Yeah, and I forget the next couple of lines, but then it goes...  Secret tunnel!  Secret tunnel!  Through the mountain!   Secret, secret, secret, secret tunnel!"
Can't wait for Colin to unearth a T-Rex.
I love how he’s so nervous of someone hearing him digging, yet he’s posting it on his YouTube channel with millions of subscribers! Genius!
Colin accidently breaks into an ancient cave system and connects it to his bunker and the Shed.. :D
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates 🎈
I love that this video is tagged #minecraft
plot twist all his neighbours watch his videos
i wondered if and when he would install a crane inside his shed...and then the crane came
make mini excavator to dig hole.
Being that deep has to be fairly quiet already no?
I went to download FirstTrade but unfortunately it isn't available in the states 😕
You are such super productive hardworker i can't beliveve  only respect and cheers with lager to you
I wonder when the like count will reach the number of shovel swings… 😜👍👍👏👏👏👏
What are you doing up at 1am (Australia)? Waiting for the new furze video of course and it was worth the wait
Fred west wasn’t sponsored by anyone. You’re lucky
ABSOLUTELY GREAT !!!!
He should make it look like the tunnels in Hogans Heroes.
Planning to shotcrete the walls?
When i was 7 me and a friend wanted to dig a tunnel from my sandbox 1km to our school...
Digg a tunnel, dig dig a tunnel.  Quick before the hyners come!!! #mxrplays
"secret" shows it to the whole internet people
that exactly what i wanted to do as a kid and still want to do
Hell Ya!
Can we have a bet on how many episodes it's going to be? I think 20.
You know minecraft is just a game, right?
This is totally awesome
Man’s already ready for a apocalypse, well better ready than sorry  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
I liked that great escape reference 😂
This guy was my child hood
Got to love him calling it a secret bunker when it's literally been posted and viewed millions of times on YouTube with this exact location LOL
Covid Haircut :)
I'm so freaking exited seeing this project, man I wanna have a hobby like this.
how you alredy have 11 mil i watch since i was 8 or something when my baby sitter showed you on youtube
Surely you a buttload of planning permission for all this?
I have a question, why is the tunnel connecting the bunker, shed and house... but not the garage despite going nearly there on the presentation?
Was gonna say that i wanna enter Colins tunnel but it sounds so wrong.🌚🌚🌚
TOO THE DEAPTHS!!!!!!
You should've called tommy shelby
Colin Furze can even make digging a hole look fun
Well ur "Secret" entrance isnt secret if u shared it with 11 million  people
A "secret" tunnel, that he puts on YouTube, so maybe not as secret as he would like lol
I wish my neighbours were as conscientious about noise as you were! They'd be hammering until 6AM in the morning if they were digging a hole!
Chapo Guzman mode
Love it!! Surely ate that depth your neighbours wouldn't hear anything anyway?
I respect the patience he has to do this because I definitely don't
You are Basically batman
Madboi Colin digging down and ignoring the possibility of lava underneath... always makes for a fun watch, but make sure you leave your diamond tools and other stuff in a chest.
Not that SECRET!
What do colin's neighbors hear?                                           heavy metal
doesn't want neighbors to hear digging a massive tunnel... put's video up digging massive tunnel for millions to see 🤔
He's only doing this secretly cuz he probably don't have planning permission 😂
Love it
10:23 wow he literally uncovered Saddam Sussein's hiding place
What kind of permits did you/were you supposed to get to do this?
11:17 is that mr bean?
Looks like manual labour will actually kill you before you finish the build suck it up wimp
If I was this man's neighbour I would always say "what the heck is he doing now?"
Seeing the ad in the middle makes me realize why he was vacuuming his hair....   LoL
#minecraft lol
Capitol? Capital?
Start making bricks with that clay...
no hard hat? no safety tie? you're a maniac!
Saying it's a secret tunnel but throws a public video. 🤣🤣
I'm not sure whether you need it for this, but have you got planning permission for the tunnel? They'll need to be checked by a professional at some point to make sure the walls won't collapse in, & if they do then for the bracing not to buckle under it.
Colin is literally living every dude's dream by digging a huge hole
Just asking😂.    Did you check, if there is a pipe down there?
Colin Furze: I want to build a secret underground passageway in compete silence so that nobody knows what is going on. Also Colin: Uploads his progress to a YouTube channel with 11 million subscribers.
What about the crack ?
2:45  Gas-powered auger/post hole digger?
imagen a veiwer calls the cops on you... and you need to tell them what all this i about...
Colin,  i gotta wonder how you got city permission to dig like this ..  this is freaking cool .. only problem is, when all is says and done you are going to have to steal all the permits from the local office, track down all the employees of the government who signed off on this, all the contractors that helped and anyone else that saw this and.... eliminate them so your bunker stays secret😈😆😁👍😆😆😆😆
Could you make a hydraulic screw for the sides and use that.
Who would have thunk that me searching for flatland tricks nearly a decade ago would lead us here
dude ... is it really secret   if it is posted on youtube ??
We started our channels 11 days apart. Yours has done a wee bit better but I'm still trying.
A jet powered bucket wheel earth mover would do the horizontal parts nicely.
what's the music at 12:17 please ?
Not very secret now is it? Lol
Meanwhile, in the whole world everybody is just eating and defecating.
Completely bonkers! And I love it! Dig on! 🥸💪🏼😎😁
I didn't think i would be this hyped for someone digging a hole. love it.
Colin is the best no cap
3:08 you look like the shoveler from mystery men
We need a Colin furze collaboration with minecraft
Neighbors: oh thank God, he's only building a tunnel, we thought he was building a fusion reactor.
colin is going to be the next el Chapo for tunnles.
Yes Colin!
I guess if Colin invested in the stock market he'd be able to not have a sponsor but then again he's nice and ales companies sponsor him so he can give us free stuff
Absolute insanity! Love it
Why don't you use gas powered hole digging machines?
Colin: left , right, and then left, to the nearest bank
An efficiency 4 diamond pickaxe with haste 2 beacon would've made short work of this.
ah yes, the ususal digging spree in the uk.
Did you find out where that little crack the draft was coming from is leading to?
I've done a lot of digging and concrete breaking before but I've never worked on a project as interesting or fun as this one. Go on you beauty, keep going <3
Confused dog face when Colin says he doesn't want to disturb the neighbors (looks at all other builds).
Should have used post hole diggers to dig straight down would be soo much easier and easier on your back.
Is anyone else asking themselves why Colin did not build a tunnelling machine ?
who could dislike this
I'm sure Colin is glad that his attire has stayed the same over so many years so the video is easier to edit together.
"secret" tunnel video on a channel with 11 million subscribers
my guy might aswell build a copy of the Riese complex and accualy finish it
Colin over here trying to make as little noise as possible so his neighbors won't notice, but I think the silence would be more suspicious
Most of the stuff you do still surprises me even after 6 years of watching. Great work
I am completely sure that this holds a world record for the amount of work put into digging a hole.
This is worth the wait my friend
Kwai993505044 thanku
I’m guessing Colin hasn’t heard of micro shovels
You are on another level to the rest of us Colin 👍😎 - Respect for the amount of hard work and hours you put in....
Charles Bronson would be proud of you..👍👍
I feel like Colin has asshole neighbors ngl
Dude, that was simply hilarious! Colin, you are still killing it. Still got so much fire and crazy ideas. Great chanal with top content, thanks!!
not that secret
Haha this just answered my question in the last video hahaha
colin got loads of determination to build something that takes him over a year to make... I love it!
But where did the draft come from!?!
Have ye not played Minecraft?  You should never ever dig straight down! Get a harness!  :D
Love living my dream through you
How does this man deal with HOA
I wonder how much value is added to his property with the bunker, the swings, and now the tunnels
Minecraft UK version
THIS CHANNEL IS MY DREAM
Good movie reference !
Unpopular opinion: the music makes my ears crumble
11:38 Wait, if this was in the middle of september, that means this video is already close to a year old? WHAT ELSE ARE YOU HIDING COLIN!?!?!?!
This man converted his Minecraft home to real life home
Proper sick Colin 👍
Fantastic! I was ho-hum about the tunnel project videos but now I am fired up to see more. I hadn't considered the bedrock debacle or a crack! Holy! Now we are seeing bracing and a steel screens. Looking forward to the horizontal. Good thing you started this back in 2018 otherwise we'd all be sitting on the edges of our seats wondering if you'd made it through another filming session alive. Cheers!
Only Colin Furze would look at his hoover he is using to hoover his hair with and say "Where is your jet engine?"
Wouldn't change the end of that hydronic to a shovel be easier
Its middle of september? Colin your videos are made 10 months in advance? How can you plan that well jeez
Gawd, I'm tired just watching
I wonder if the neighbors follow this YouTube channel
Damn.
This is what I thought I could do with my cheap plastic beach shovel.
It will crash like bitcoin did your wallet fact.
50,000 people know about your secret tunnel now. Not so secret eh?
yes tom lamb!!
I can only imagine what it was like to get planning permission for that
I couldn't imagine what you went through doing all that digging then editing then digging then editing then digging....
I bet Colin his children love what he does, keep up the creativity
Madness shear madness.                   2x👍
And there goes colin and his freinds, single handedly raising the value of his house by a few hundred thousand pounds.
looks like lock down officially got to Colin
How do you get planning permission for all of this?
когда переиграл в фаллаут))
I love this idea!!!!
This is f*in mental!! Love it!
how to make a secret tunnel in your minecraft base
I love this I can't wait for part 3
Definitely does not look like enough clearance at the end of the electric motor on his hydraulic pump for proper cooling airflow.
43k views already :) arfter this u need to build an elevator that goes really really deep below ur house
a lot of effort to build this...Colin does everything for the subscriber ...thats why I love him
What about a small Tunnel Boring Machine like what was used to dig the Channel Tunnel but a much smaller version.
mans actually tagged it Minecraft
Dude why are u not working with Space X for the construction of StarShip? U are a great builder thinker
Fun fact :NO ONE don't no that there is a secret room. its viral 🤣🤣
Part 3... Furze discovers the crack is actually a Bat Cave!
LOTS OF ROOF SUPPORT WILL BE NEEDED  MOVING FORWARD
I was waiting for the Great Escape clip. Escape tunnels are every kids dream.
How about you stop voting for people who will give you lockdowns?
DIGGING A SECRET TUNNEL Part2- Colin escapes the UK
Colin: "Shovels are too big, I need to make these shorter"  Trenching Shovels: *exist*
At this point just make a mine
Love this project you are doing! Also kinda curious how much gold (if any) there is in all that dirt coming from the tunnel
Dang. I don't know how to phrase this in words but this is the best. EVER! I'm just imagining myself in that tunnel and it would be so awesome! Keep going! I can't wait until this is done.
That's what she said   6:08
Not really a secret tunnel when millions of people will be able to see you make it
Don't think we've missed the hilarity of all the effort to hide what you are doing... while posting videos about it on the internet LoL.
1:59  *after two minutes * Karen: Manager! manager! manager!
This guy is the reason I am pursuing a degree in welding
Did anybody else notice colins arm 5:36
Make conveyor belt
Amazing skills legend is our Colin ;) keep the videos coming where all routing for you
This is freaking sensational, Mr.Furze hands down you are one the best!

Rule number one. Never dig straight down.
Imagine how it looks like to have a neighbour who's carrying tons of dirt out of his small shed
Secret huh
Honestly you should make at least two more levels to your bunker as it is a fallout shelter with no air filtration or radiation resistance nor does it have a door that keeps out people. Also I hope you have a plan for pumping air into your tunnel while you’re digging.
You need a rock conveyer lol  Excellent work though keep going!!
Find any bones Colin? lol
I can’t wait to watch this video! 😂😂
Much respect to you Colin. Keep up with your hardwork.
Poggers, colin getting ready for the apocalypse!!
13:30 at that depth i doubt you can hear anything from outside if you cover the exit a bit
God damn you are hardcore.....and you have certainly removed some hardcore!
i bet that crevise that colin found carries the zombie virus that dooms us.
Go on lad get that tunnel built 😮🥵
Man..your so good..💪💪💪💪💪👍
make an elevator into the entrance
I'm a Dwarf and I'm digging a hole Diggy diggy hole, diggy diggy hole I'm a Dwarf and I'm digging a hole Diggy diggy hole, diggy diggy hole
This is brilliant Colin keep up the great work!
Great use of old footage Colin😉
Me an a few mates dug out a den many years ago. I don't envy your task.
Things are getting interesting
Colins other half must have patience of a Saint
For the love of god, find an engineer to help you with this, cave in's are no joke, do you even know what class of soil your working in for stability? The max height for a vertical trench in 1200mmor 4 feet before you need stabilization. One day i will relize you havent posted in a while and i will know why. That mesh is not going to hold back a collapes.
Minecraft
So what was the breeze from?? Did you hit a natural gas line or a sewer pipe? lol
What happened to the cave thing you found?
It's "Capital" mate, not "Capitol"
I'm really digging this project!
please can  we have some different music to your videos...cheers
Epic
Ur crazy 👌🙂
He’s gonna go down to bedrock and fall through the void at this rate.
This way to France. That way to Canada.
Happy 11millon
Yes Colin you legend I've always wanted to dig a tunnel
Fred Dibnah built a tunnel in his garden, he had a clever frame for building the wall for the shaft from the top down!
♪ Diggy Diggy Hole  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytWz0qVvBZ0
his made millions, just buy out the neighbours,
Brilliant but as mad as fuck!!!
Who are the 6 people who disliked this video? Are they all Furze's neighbors?
How can someone dislike this? THIS IS THE COOLEST VIDEO SERIS ON YOUTUBE!!!!!!!!
https://youtu.be/_21JwWWT2R0
Any 🇱🇰
Any the Shawshank redemption   fan here?
Colin's tunnel is reminding me off some mexican cartel business lol
Oh man, what a project
Colin Furze should have his own prime time tv show!!!!!
Loving this. Notifications...ON
That's some big dig energy right there!
Colin build a amphibious car!
Impressive project indeed. Really fun to follow
Absolute legend this mans talent is unmatched.
Colin knows something his preparing for something should we be scared
my hero ..... i am gonna order a safety tie ....
You’ll need to build a really good locking system from the inside to all the hatches
Seeing Colin in short, dress shirt and a tie made me think of Angus Young from AC/DC
Mantap, from Indonesian
Don't dig straight down or you might fall in lava 😋
nice
Love the series
It took Andy many years to do it. Let's see if you can do it faster!
Can’t wait for the day when you build a secret Trainline from your house into France
I really believe that Colin's talent goes beyond common sense and mechanical ability. He's a genius. He may actually be the one building the spaceships for Elon Musk. Lol. Wow, there's some possibilities for a new video.
You should use one of those ice whole drillers
SECRET TUNNEL
I’m not sure why he is so worried with the noise!!!! If he had just started the dig from the underground bunker to the shed he would have had all the sound barrier he could have ever needed. I’m sure he will think of that soon.
What no dirt conveyer belt?
Sooooo gooooooood
Imagine the property value on his house
Epic.
I've been waiting for this!! This is the best project you've done yet. Keep it up.
Cant stop thinking GROW ROOM !
No midroll ads… I respect that
I want Colin's house when he's done with it. How hard is it for a yank to buy property in the Queens country? 🤣
You have been doing this for the  past 2 years???  Absolute madlad !
Today is not my birthday Today my Dog has not died  I just want 70 likes on this
So your telling me some dude named el chapo did this in a prison with tools that he made for probably miles 😧
That hole looks like a small vadose canyon. The Lincolnshire limestone does have some immature caves (as in young not that make knob gags) so it’s quite likely what you found really is cave and will be connected to something on the surface somewhere but probably very small.
I’ve a feeling he has no planning permission for it and it’s better to ask for forgiveness than ask for permission 😂
imagine what happens when he has to get rid of the house
Nothing surprises me with Colin anymore. makes you think how people dug themself's out of jail lol now you can see what they went through.
This is amazing even by Furze standards.  :D
So cool! can't wait for part 3!
Only a few minutes in and so many good references - the Great Escape, the D. I. (where my brother asked me to be his best man - technically it was our local growing up)... love it
This is THE BEST top secret tunnel build I have ever watched on YouTube   TOP SECRET BUNKER THIS WAY -->
Colin IF the apocalypse happens when your alive i think you just going to have a underground Mansion/Fort with all sorts of cool gadgets and weapons
Strange piles of Earth appearing in Stamford 😂😂😂 nice one 👍
Seems a simple auger would make quick work here.
But Colin your always making loads of noise any way so what’s the difference now surely the would get suspicious about you not make noise
Forget milf, its milcf Man I Love Colin Furze
Not a secrete entrance when you show 11 million people
"Secret" with permission from his city and probably several other authorities and ministries
Lets be real. You guys like the video before watching it ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) amirite?
The best! 😎📌
Damn it furze I need a bunker and a tunnel now!
*Reads title*  Mexican Drug Lords: Interesting...
Alreeady excited for next week or next episode
Do you need planning permission
Loves to see all the details, dont mind the dragging around since most of the build he done is skipping some of the details to make it more presentable in certain time limit.. he deserved more ads in each parts of the video.. the only problem i have is, i know he literally released this video, but where is part 3??? Cant waittt
broke rule 1, never dig straight down
One sick and crazy Pup !!!!
Crazy dedication you have sir
5:00 = Henry ftw
Thank you
Fill them tubs with good soil and get some good seeds and make that bunker pay for its self ? Mushrooms of corse 😉😂.
Guys he used the #minecraft
I just try to imagine doing this in Arizona An I’m exhausted
Colin - "Don't skip this bit" Me -  Instantly skips that bit
very complicated
Make a mini elevator in the tunnel :D
now i want to see a body transformation video
Is there problems with Karen neighbours
damnn ur patience leveeeeeeeelllllllllllll...also the sponsorss patience levelllllllllllllll
Not exactly secret if you post it on Youtube
I'm looking for engineering uni courses, anyone got any good recommendations or useful things to know?
That really looks like a mineshaft
Look good. Keep up the work I think you can do it
Hiding the dirt is always the hard part when secretly digging a tunnel.
Yes yes yes part 2!
Absolute Maverick of a project....
I tought he was joking about the neighbours part
Don't you think its more suspicious if your shack is silent than some weird, loud noises coming out of it?
just use magic powers dud
Damn, I didn't know Hitachi made other power tools that also vibrate, but in a different way
El Chapo would be proud.
I can only come up with 2 words to describe this, nucking futs!! Band practice cracked me up!
Way too much work. Plus I'm surprised it did not flood or that there was no water in the ground. The water table must be very low there.
Truly, humans are amazing. You are an amazing human, Colin. Keep being awesome!
Love from India
You are nuckin futtz man, I love it.
i have the feeling that you don't have a permit for this one
Is he not aloud to dig the tunnel and that is why he said he was playing loud music over it?
You look tired!!!!
I can’t believe I’ve just watched Colin dig a hole 🕳 you can’t beat it
Secret tunnel, secret tunnnelll, through the mountain, secret tunnell
When do you start dynamiting?
everyone : but , why ? colinfurze : because why not  :D
"Two lovers, forbidden from one another A war divides their people And a mountain divides them apart Built a path to be together  ...Yeah, and I forget the next couple of lines, but then it goes...  Secret tunnel! Secret tunnel! Through the mountain! Secret, secret, secret, secret tunnel! Yeah!"
oh boy i cant wait for the next video
Me: why don't you build a hoisting system? 1 second later : boom, it's there.   This guy is genius!
Soon on the news: "Famous youtuber discovers Atlantis under his backyard". 😂😂
The great escape reference was amazing!!
El chapo could help you!!!! 😂😂
4:50 “Your Capitol is at Risk“ whom are you going to invade😂
Colin you're amazing. Nothing too big. Love your content pal, keep up the crazy! 🤪😜🤪
Can't wait!!
I watched the video last week and kind of wondered why and then I spent a week thinking about it and after watching this video I realized why not build a tunnel system in your house
Guess it is not much of a secret anymore?
You would think that his neighbors would get more suspicious if he wasn't making any noise 🕵️
Make a rocket boy Elon musk need you.
If I got the coco pops and then opened them to see soil… I should be out into solitary confinement
So where did the cave end up going?
Waiting for the bones of uncle Fred in there....
you should keep the mesh look for the sides it makes it look like your in a cave elevator
This is getting fucking crazy
colins puts the lotion on the skin, yes it does
bet you didn't get council approval for this tunnel and that's why you have to cover the noise with music
Remember that time you used all those stone bricks and garbage as 'filler' for your foundations thinking nobody will notice? Think about that when you decide to dig a tunnel under your house X years later...
why, JUST WHY would you give a thumbsdown?
"Breaking News! UK police bust YouTuber ColinFurze building a narco tunnel" 🤣
Love it! How the hell do you get planning permission/building control approval for stuff like this and the bunker? 😂😂😍😎👍🏻
I'm digging one right now in the direction of the pub
3:44 you need a fork
:)
ooo
That’s bloody cool that is
I've been wanting you for ever. Surely noise coming from your shed is normal for the neighbours 😀
It's "Capital at risk", not "Capitol", so all bets are off if I lose my money, I'll sue you for the US Congress Building.
*July 2021 not April 2021
9th!
Great escape reference lol
What a great vid Colin keep up the amazing work
the man goin' insane
Nice progress
Wow
Loving this project but again can't help but feel it's being dragged out over multiple vids because of the sponsor :(
This person literally preparing for world War 🌎🤣🤣genz
Your Capitol is at risk? Is Colin going to attack the US Capitol? 😂
Something from the "Drill" tank might be of use here....the potato gun maybe?....bwahahahaha
Am I tripping or didn't he already build a hydraulic system exactly like that while removing the exact same rubbish xd
Ahhhhhhhh, think hot fuz reference with sign in pub
The initial 10 minute gang 😎😎
I love how he insists on doing all of this heavy digging in a shirt and tie.
Could you not use an auger?
get butterflies in my stomach when I'm watching your videos
Nothing more exciting then digging a hole. Honestly!
Hes digging straight down
To make this video complete colin only needs the indian look..... For those who understand....
Colin നെ കാണാൻ വന്നവർ ഉണ്ടോ
Super bro iam fan of you
one step further to become batman
Hydraulic TBM
I wonder if the waiters thought the bag was a tip or something then looked inside and found a pile of dirt lol
This has made my week
To get rid of the soil you obviously dig another tunnel and put it in there.
How does this guy not have a mansion with all the views and money he must make
Colin you should of called it a secret name like in ww2 when British officers dug out of POW camps
he must be the best and funist uncle ever
Any job working me please
Nice
Does anybody else wonder why his neighbours left? Just me then?
Secret Tunnel! Secret Tunnel! Through the Mountains. Secret Secret Secret Secret Tunnel!
Unsubscribing because Colin was using a reusable bag for a single use disposal of dirt.  Be better to the Environment you eco-murderer.
I'm puzzled as to why the hatch opens in the direction it does. Wouldn't rotating it through 180 degrees make it easier to life and replace the carpet? And you didn't think of maybe making a tunnelling machine?
Wait, the hydraulic pump was not installed to operate the press?? He just made something up to cover his digging project??? Damn... This man...
Why is the music twice as loud as the speech? Makes me want to turn off the audio.
elchapo watching this in his cell
Colin вам нужен транспортёр! И сразу землю в грузовик
Colin is going to be ripped after all of this.
I know why it’s taking so long, he is using a pickaxe instead of an efficiency 5 diamond shovel.
Tim Hunkin and Colin need to collaborate.
Wait you mounted the hydraulics a while ago. Have you been doing this since then
Love your vids
I seriously dont get why you didnt use an auger like a post hole digger or something, an electric hydraulic would be quieter than a shovel
4:10 LMAO  I’ve been a trombone player for at least 3 years now. This is funny.
7
i was waiting one week for this video
Don't dig down
He, He, He....
Now Iam pretty sure that the pyramids were built by a small group of Colins
Do you have planning permission this time?
Nice haircut
It so secret that Colin still bragging about the tunnel is a secret tunnel.
Great
colin make a conveyor belt to transport the dirt away
Honestly, Tom Lamb is probably my favourite character in the Furzeverse.
Furze reinvents the short handle shovel.  Yikes!
Привет русским
I hope that none of the pranksters get the idea about leaveling dirt bags in public places...
Col! Not a secret tunnel now! Sweet tho :)
I dig this idea.
Flashbacks to the beach house
Discontinuous project💥💣!!!))))Very cool!!!
British 811 is gonna have a field day with this
You REALLY need to make yourself a TBM (tunnel boring machine.  Or hire Musk's boring company).
What people do when they are bored of corona:
Coline should built a room with a under ground garage
Just imagine the open house when he sells this property   “so that’s it for the house would you like to check out the secret tunnel and apocalypse bunker” Client: “the what?”
4:10 Is it me, or does Colin look like Suggs whilst he is lipping that bone?
I can't lie I always dreamed of doing something like this when I was a kid... Now as an adult I realize how much time, work, and money it would actually require. There's a reason he started this project years ago.
As always i got a cool video and new songs to listen ^^ thanks :)
El Chapo would be proud
Steady Colin, if you find gold or oil you do not own the mineral rights to your property, some bloke called Boris Johnson does!
I wonder what the next owners of this house would think of a tunnel and bunker  just chilling (It would be best to keep this as a family heirloom lol)
The irony is after uploading the video this not a secret anymore....
Tunnel for weapons..
nice video
Tell me Colin how is it secret, when 11M watches you??
"how much dirt did you dig?" him: "yes"
This is hard work!!!!!
ANOTHER TUNNEL VIDEO LETSSSS GOOO....  THANK YOU COLIN SO MUCH FOR FULLFILING A CHILDHOOD FANTASY
this really reminds me of that one Rick and Morty episode.
Why wouldn't you do band practice in the bunker it is sound proof
Who else is going back over older videos and noticing the edge-of-carpet-screwed-to-baton they missed the first time around?
I wonder what colins neighbours think of him. I mean like playing trompet at night. Haha
3:53 350z noisezzz
Yeeees
5 minutes craft
*digs secret hole* *proceeds to post it on YouTube for the entire world to see* 😂 Epic project.
Getting Minecraft feels :-)
I love that you have a "The Danish Invader", and in Denmark, we have english pubs :D  Also, what movies was the clips from?
Where is your mustache
In Germany we call it "Klappspaten"
Still mad to think this has been sitting there hidden and out of shot for so many videos since this project was started with nobody the wiser
Hi I love your videos man have a great day
Thank god for the great escape reference, would have been a travesty to miss that opportunity
Your such a nice guys big brain 😜
His trombone skills are very good( not) 😂
cant wait to see the finished product 👍🏼
Love this project and the videos. Hilarious!!
Словил флэшбеки с канала "самоделкин", тоже делает "копчик" ахахаха. Колин как всегда красава. Дай бог здоровья
2:15 strange piles of dirt appearingin stamford
So is just gonna dig a hole for 14 minutes
Compressed air powered wind instruments
SECRET TUNNEL

Lol he will never recognize me he’ll never respond and pin my comment until the day I die I will give him 50$ if he does
I knew there was something strange about the Cocopops I bought yesterday!!!

Colin is the coolest guy I know
fun
Who has a small garage but big things hapenbin his garage
Hi have a good day :)
From all us Aussie views your a bloody legend
HERE WE GO PEOPLE THE GROUND HAS BEEN BROKEN, sign up to be a channel member and see a sneak peak on Sunday of progress so far. Also got a new Tee in the Furze Merch store https://www.colinfurzeshop.com Thanks for watching and hope you enjoy it all.
he seems stupid in his vids but hes acctualy so smart
I was expecting some crazy digging machine powered by a jet hahah
I like the way that THIS project's diagram is far more straight-line and accurate than most of his others. Even Furze realizes this has high downside potential if done wrong! :)
Amazing
:)
I wish i could do the same but i'm not "allowed" by the city to dig under my own house or garden.
Ohh yeaaa
pretty ironic secret tunnel on youtube with instructions how to enter it and everything, makes you guess how secret it is
I love the great escape reference
Like a wiseman once said "If you can dig, you can dig for gold". That wiseman was -Me
lol
Let's be honest Colin can't be not crazy.
my life is complete i got to a colin furze video less than a minute after upload
Uploaded 2 mins ago
Secret tunnel secret tunnel through the mountains secret secret secret secret tunnel.
Colin Furze Minecraft letsplay
As always a fantastic video from you. Love your job!

*Colinfurz cuzing back to the future doctor*
Not so secret anymore
So happy I didn't go to sleep yet, just got home from work and this awesomeness pops up, THANK YOU COLIN
