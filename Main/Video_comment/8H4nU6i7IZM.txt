Can’t believe it’s been nearly 3 years
No, woman, no cry No, woman, no cry  I remember when we used to sit In the government yard in Trenchtown Oba, observing the hypocrites Mingle with the good people we meet Good friends we have and good friends we've lost Along the way In this great future, you can't forget your past So dry your tears I say  No woman, no cry No woman, no cry 'Ere, little darlin', don't shed no tears No, woman, no cry  Said I remember when we used to sit In the government yard in Trenchtown And then Georgie would make the fire light, as it was Log wood burning through the night Then we would cook cornmeal porridge Of which I'll share with you My feet is my only carriage No, I've got to push on through So while I'm gone  Everything's gonna be alright Everything's gonna be alright Everything's gonna be alright now Everything's gonna be alright Everything's gonna be alright Everything's gonna be alright Everything's gonna be alright now Everything's gonna be alright  So woman, no cry, cry, cry No, woman, no (no, woman, no cry) No No, woman, no cry, no cry No, woman, no cry  Mmh, ooh Ohh

So beautiful, Instrumentals❤️😭
Can anybody realize that these lyrics were made by bob Marley  Word for word  Bar for bar it’s the same song
Quick question: is the song original for the movie, or was it a pre-existing song? Thank you!
What a voice!!!!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️ this the best cover of this song I’ve ever heard
Rest in peace king boseman , legends never die you can rest king.
💚💛❤
Be strong...everything is gonna be alright!
Its 12:15 AM and I just found out thiw was a cover of Bob Marley's version. I love this song and the feelings it invokes. This version and the original are so beautiful.
Everything gonna be alright 🕉️
No woman no cry
Bob Marley would be so proud.
Rest up Chadwick. We love and miss you.
Soothes my soul the perfect way
It's some time but this song still brings up feelings of "hey everything will be alright" even when you know the pain will still be there. (lost two brothers in a less-than 4 months) to cancer.
Didn't even know this was a bob Marley so what a wonderful surprise
the song is better than movie itself
I'm depressed, listening to this song feeling empty. I so badly want to tell my inner child how sorry I am for how much fear and pain he's experienced in my hands. Everyone leaves... Should I leave too
The song is hands down the best part of the movie…. but yea, movie was pretty awful…
Fuck Toxic MCU fans, who call this movie bad, GOTG 3 and Shang Chi was the trash not this
RIP WAKANDA FOREVER
big like 💚💛❤
When that bass drop hit😭😭goosebumps🤞🏾
Uma musica que parece ser cantada pelos anjos recebendo o Chadiwick. Uma homenagem dubla, ao Bob Marley e ao nosso pantera negra para sempre
Awe... Family!🥰🙏🏾💕😘
I love a good cover and this one- lol don't tell me not to cry!! You're crying!! You totally entrapped me!! Lol this song is awesome and these ladies definitely do it justice- WELL DONE👍👍
Great collaborating with us tems....ain't it🎉🎉🎉 u should link up
Tems voice is so beautiful
Bob Marley ❤️❤️
As a jamaican i can say this song is a lie,because it tell you not to cry,but thats what you end up doing
This song was sung by Bob marley
I'm in tears rn, this is so touching... thank you Tems. I'm half Nigerian and Cameroon, but I reside in Cameroon, in the English speaking region. Throughout this crisis I watch friends, innocent toddlers and course mates die. I saw the pain in mothers eye crying their lost kids. I do song too but this one touched me on a redo-cover.
😔
Não vi a tradução mas essa música parece bem triste
As a Jamaican,Tems did us good!
i miss him so much he didn't deserve this wakanda forever😞🙏
I remember drive car with my dad when this music hits
This is legendary 💯🙏🏿
You spend more time with your work family than you do with your real family
.SOLITARY LOVE DO RELIED TO.  One that suits free, Rooted Maturity : MIND UNDERSTANDING. Gods Legends They Have Rised Up Above The knowledge which it's just good over evil. IN PLACE THE LUGAR THE LOVE TRUST THE LIGHT THE GOD.   .THE RETURNING PROPERLY.  UNITED STATES OF AMERICA THAT GOVERNMENT : TRUST AND LIVELIHOOD, PUBLIC PRIVACY AND PUBLIC PRIVACY DISPLAY. THE SPIRIT THAT LIFE THE PEACE.   RUBENIAN INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION THAT CREATOR OF THE UNIVERSE THE LUGAR, PLACE : FAMILY AND WORKS, CARING AND HEART VIEW TO FAMILY AND THEIR WORKS. THE MIND UNDERSTANDING THE HEART THE ART.
I never thought I'd say there's a version of this song better than Bob's own, and even Gilberto Gil (a Brazilian icon who wrote a version of it in Portuguese that never fails to bring me to tears). Yet here we are. Tems and the team behind this arrangement managed to produce the absolute best version of "No, Woman, No Cry" there ever was.
🥺😭😭😭
This reminds me of Jamaica 🇯🇲 😢
Most beautiful and reassuring thing I have heard  right now.... Everything will be alright guys
First heard this sung by a buddy of mine, fell in love with it so deeply moving
love how she is bring back the memories of chadwick boseman and bob marley <3  Btw lyrics here :)  [Intro] No, woman, no cry No, woman, no cry  [Verse 1] I remember when we used to sit In the government yard in Trenchtown Oba, observing the hypocrites Mingle with the good people we meet Good friends we have and good friends we've lost Along the way In this great future, you can't forget your past So dry your tears I say  [Chorus] No, woman, no cry No, woman, no cry 'Ere, little darlin', don't shed no tears No, woman, no cry  [Verse 2] Said I remember when we used to sit In the government yard in Trenchtown And then Georgie would make the fire light, as it was A log wood burning through the night Then we would cook corn meal porridge Of which I'll share with you My feet is my only carriage No, I've got to push on through But while I'm gone  [Bridge] Everything's gonna be alright Everything's gonna be alright Everything's gonna be alright now Everything's gonna be alright Everything's gonna be alright Everything's gonna be alright Everything's gonna be alright now Everything's gonna be alright So woman, no cry, cry, cry No, woman, no (Woman, no) So woman, no cry, no cry No, woman, no cry
I feel so lonely......
This song makes me cry. Reminds me of only brother who died 23rd November 2022. He was my legend.
Her voice just carries this anointing. It’s so unique 🥺
Well, whenever I listen to this song.. I can't help but giggle over Monica's Cornrows Hairstyle.  Let me know if someone gets this😆😂😂
Tems deserves the accolades she's getting. That VOICE😍😍
This song is really mean to me. Me and my mother go through a lot. I love you mom and we will face it together.
Esta nueva versión de la canción me pone nostálgica no puedo evitar recordar a Chadwick 😢
Quando ouvi pela primeira vez no trailer, a emoção tomou conta de mim
King T'Challa I give you the thanks, your soul will go to place where you will find eternal bliss and your memory will be the beacon of light that we need on dark times, and will give us the strength to lift to fight like the Hero who inspired us
I love you
No, woman, no cry No, woman, no cry  I remember when we used to sit In the government yard in Trenchtown Oba, observing the hypocrites Mingle with the good people we meet Good friends we have and good friends we've lost Along the way In this great future, you can't forget your past So dry your tears I say  No woman, no cry No woman, no cry 'Ere, little darlin', don't shed no tears No, woman, no cry  Said I remember when we used to sit In the government yard in Trenchtown And then Georgie would make the fire light, as it was Log wood burning through the night Then we would cook cornmeal porridge Of which I'll share with you My feet is my only carriage No, I've got to push on through So while I'm gone  Everything's gonna be alright Everything's gonna be alright Everything's gonna be alright now Everything's gonna be alright Everything's gonna be alright Everything's gonna be alright Everything's gonna be alright now Everything's gonna be alright  So woman, no cry, cry, cry No, woman, no (no, woman, no cry) No No, woman, no cry, no cry No, woman, no cry  Mmh, ooh Ohh
#girlfromforeign 💓💓
In all honesty, this has to be a top 3 marvel phase 4 movie. It had so many good elements in it and it was a perfect send off to Chadwick bosseman  Wakanda forever.
Although Bob Marley is assumed to have written the song on his own, as its lyrics are highly personal, it was actually credited to Vincent Ford.  Ford was a friend of Marley's who ran a soup kitchen in Trenchtown, the ghetto area of Kingston, Jamaica, where Marley grew up.  This meant that all royalty payments received by Ford allowed his work to continue.  The album's liner notes list multiple songwriters, including other family friends and band members, but all songs were written by Marley. At the time, Marley was involved in a contractual dispute with his former publishing company, Cayman Music.  Marley didn't want his new songs to be associated with Cayman, and it had been speculated that he had put them in other people's names to avoid the contractual restrictions, and as a way to "provide lasting help to family and close friends".  Marley's former manager Danny Sims later sued to gain royalty and ownership rights to the songs, saying that Marley had written the songs but had assigned the credit to Ford, to avoid commitments made in previous contracts.  A 1987 court sided with the Marley estate, assuming full control of the songs.  Ford died aged 68 in 2008, in Kingston.

Even though Chadwick wasn't in the  movie  you can still  feel his presence.
The Movie was amazing everything gonna be alright Wakanda Forever
this is so beautiful..
I can listen to her sing anything. My mama is a tuff critic and she loves this version too
I pray God will bring hope by triumphing good over evil in this world. I ask this through Christ, our Lord, Amen.
What a version. Amazing!
Beautiful 🥰🥰🥰
Bob Marley would be so proud
no cry
The Black Panther Wakanda Forever makes me feel like you gonna miss someone that lost a long time ago and the song was soulful especially the lines " Everythings gonna be alright " 😭😭
Bob is telling whosoever he's singing too not to cry because it's just life and things come and go so dry your tears and don't cry. It's just like saying baby don't cry but in Jamaica we use words differently especially  in patois so base on the context.
This version got me teary 🥲 Keep resting in peace Bob Marley the legend himself and Chadwick the legend himself Wakanda forever
Wow 😳🥺
Bob marley was my Dad's favourite.  Jah jah only you see an know😭😭
I lovethis song ! really love, this song is dedicated to him, the lyices like tell us don't cry to him and like he talking wiht us, i love the melody. Wakanda Forever!!
I lost my Grandfather too this year too
rip
Salute
damn tems you got me crying maan
Love this ❤️❤️
This is beautiful version of the song, Bob Marley would be so proud....blessing and love from the UK❤
Does anyone know the name of the singer? or if its on spotify?
Lost my grandmother to cancer a year ago now. Life hasn’t been the same since then. I do miss her, but i do feel that everything’s going to be alright.
I haven’t seen the movie yet so don’t spoiler down in the comments but hearing this sound track makes me so excited and makes me think this has the potential to be better then black panther 1 and could even be the best mcu movie I haven’t been excited like this ever for a movie.R.I.P Chadwick Boseman not only were you the king of wakanda but the king of our hearts ♥️,wakanda forever.
Where’s koffee on this?
This helps my soul recover 🤍
Wakanda forever❤💔
This movie is just too amazing welldone Marvel this movie is better than the ist one ❤❤
Wish this song was the movie. Rip Chadwick Boseman😢
Tragic song
damn this cover is legendary
❤️❤️❤️❤️🤦🥺
fajna piosenka
Very emotional 😥😥
My dad passed from stomach cancer in 2010. If they played this song at the end I would’ve lost it.
The late but great George “Georgie” Robinson. Long time friend and bredren to Bob Marley was immortalized by Bob Many years and now as someone who met and got to spend my years with him I am proud to hear his name on the international scene a man who live without any need for money and made us laugh with hilarious character and story telling. Long live “Georgie” #fixuplife
Wow...Marvel featuring no woman no cry❤️
Awesome!!
I miss my mother.
Bob Marley ❤️
So love this version. One Love 💚💛❤️
Is it rihanna singing " everything's gonna be alright"
Wow just wow.. I'm in tears thinking about Chad, my mom and those i lost. loved this song before but Tems...you put a whole other feeling i'm choked up...this movie, the soundtrack for it gonna be legendary
Damn I don't think I'll be able to get through Wakanda Forever if I can't get through this song  without breaking down 🥺
So beautiful
best movie i’ve ever watched
This song reminds me of the passing of my closest family members...... This song really hits me to the core..... and so the movie..... Black Panther is really not just a superhero movie. It's something I would call it special.
No llores mujer by Anuel aa
Me encanta esta versión 😊
❤️❤️
Beautiful ❤️
Bob would be proud 🙃
Tems and Koffee sound so much alike. Koffee is a Jamaican artist.
does anyone know if the trailer version exists with the song alright
this song was sung by Bob Marley
Big up 🇯🇲
This song deserves to be the top 5 songs on YouTube.. just the words + the emotional ties to this movie... but look at the views.. yet other artists drop trash, generic songs and they get millions of views in just hours.. tragic really
We want the trailer version full song
Music adds depth and flavor to movies...without the scores the movie would be bland..they’d be soulless  and flavorless...Ludwig was amazing since the sounds selected fit the scenes they were in...especially Shuris theme 🔥
Kinda sad that we dont have any big reggae artists anymore I miss them, maybe people just dont appreciate their culture's anymore
I remember black panther when I listen this song 😭😭😭.
❤
I can't stop listening to this song!! TEMS you are amazing for this ❤️ 🙌🏾❤️🙌🏾
The Canadian lad. Because the almighty said your time is done time to join me. Amen
Un gran temaso
How it alll started
Chills.  My goodness everything about black panther is amazing including the music.
Such a touching song. 💜
Temmmsss ❤❤❤❤❤
This song is Amazingly Beautiful,
So beautiful
This movie ripped my heart apart and stitched it right up, the tears won't stop. I lost my mother to Cancer in 2018 and this movie, the tribute to Chadwick...I can't explain how it means so much more to me personally now, much more than any other Marvel movie...or any movie for that matter.
Wakanda Forever!!❤❤❤👊🔥

Ryan Cogler is a genius!  One thing is for sure: while watching the start and end of the movie:   My King Chadwick  Tchalla Boseman will live On  forever in my heart💜
Tems sang this song like a true rasta soldier...may God bless wakanda....long live Chadwick boseman(king tchala)
I was really waiting for It to play in the end but they chose some rihana song over it which was good too but this had emotion’s attached to it since trailer and deep lyrics.
Man this song gonna make me tear up when I see the movie. RIP Chadwick

This movie was so amazing and powerful. A great tribute to Chadwick.
Aw no Kendrick
This movie both hurt and moved my heart
Got goose bumps
Bob Marly would be proud RIP Chadwick
I can't hear this version without crying.
Saw the movie. It felt like a gut punch. Beginning to end. It's hard sometimes to separate life from a fantasy like a movie usually does. The whole things felt like a farewell for him. I don't like crying for a celebrity, but I do think it's ok to shed tears for a human being passing. I shed them today for a human being I never met, but I hope is resting peacefully.
My feet is my only carriageeeee... Leaves me a mess🥺🥺 such a deep emotional song. Thank you Tem.  Bob, a legend forever❤
Wow!
The movie and the soundtrack album are nowhere near the first instalment, yet this is beautiful. Tems needs to sing this at the Oscars.
Today, I cry for a movie premiere, for many reasons but ofc for Chadwick.
Rest in peace CHADWICK BOSEMAN 😇🤍

The single version of the track and the version which featured in his greatest hits album Legend was recorded live at the Lyceum in London and included on the album Live!  The song has a strong legacy, placing 37 on Rolling Stone’s “500 Greatest Songs of All Time.” It has been covered multiple times, most famously by The Fugees and Nina Simone.  Bob listed his childhood friend, Vincent Ford, as one of the songwriters. Vincent ran a soup kitchen in Jamaica and the royalties from the song helped him keep the kitchen running.

The same sort of thing happens for me with the word cry, no woman no cry, maybe it does not make much sense as the log burning love burning, the idea that bob marley was singing that without women there were no cries, as in cries of protest always had me wondering if men did not suffer if there were no suffering women around which can’t really be considered to be a sensible idea but maybe it could be the romantic idea of some man to brave to protest for himself who protests for women. One person told me that the words were no woman no crime which sets of a whole diferent set of questions. Of course if the cry is a cry of protest from somone who does not like to see women hurt then the no is no cry if it is or when it is alternatively ano woman nah cry nah as in dont cry then the nah is dont and the cry is tears not protest so the no or nah, nah being dont cry can be, maybe, interchangeable, changing the meaning of the song a little bit or giving alternative meanings but if the meaning is nah cry as in woman dont cry then cry changes from a shout of protest to tears. All this about crying does not make so much sense as a play on words in which somtimes you can understand love burning and sometimes log burning, fires are also a sybol of emotional warmth and in log burning you get the very earthy idea of george bringing people together and providing a fire for them which creates the love burning through the night , the troubles of the slum would be the night through which love burnt, the love created by such as george.  +21 JS 9 years ago And then Georgie would make the fire light-  Georgie, being a person, would have Bob’s joint burning.  +11 Jamaican gyal 3 years ago I think that it could mean that he doesn’t want his woman to cry and wants her only to be happy or that all women should be happy and never be made to cry. He wants happiness for said woman/women, to look back on the good times and that the past is not always bad. Love this song, brings tears to my eyes every single time.  +6 nthk 2 years ago Bob is saying in Jamaican, “Please don’t cry.” (“no woman no cry”) He’s saying goodbye, (I’ve got to push on through) and reminiscing as he leaves her. It’s the plight of the poor working man (“my feet is my only carriage”). He has to leave his family to a strange place to provide for them, where he would miss the traditional things in the village. He comforts her; “everything’s gonna be alright.” He loves her; “little darling”.  +4 AdrianAdrizzyStonerCittyBurke 8 years ago bob lived in JA first off we’ve never needed log fires inside our homes especially in the inner city heat of trench town its the tropics fires are generally very symbolic and common in our culture and functional alot of food like porridge can be cooked outdoors on a log fire also'logwood' only sounds like ‘love would’ because its patois also idk if bob played with the lyrics “my feet is my only carriage' on the diff recordings of this song but i know thats what he said on the first one again its patois people always think they’re hearing something else  +2 BILLY FISCHER 4 years ago Love bob marley  +2 finetuned a year ago love life.live life..live love..love love…  +1 Seathruin O'Dalaigh a year ago struggling to find the source for this, but have come across it in the past… No Woman Na Cry.. translates from gaeilge as (na = don’t).. this originates from the preceding slavery of the Irish under Cromwell 1640-1651 some 250,000 to 300,000 children were given to indentured servitude under economic and political supression in the tobacco growing era.. black slavery followed with the take off of the sugar industry which was more labour intensive… a mixing the African and Irish has led not just to a race of blue eyed blacks but a mixing of languages and accents. Na (withh a fada on the a) is pronounced in the broad term in Irish as phonetic “naw or naa” rather than the abrupt term Na (withe the A as in apple).. na in this pronuciation without the fada is the plural of “the” (singluar “an” plural “na”) an bothar = the road na bothair = the roads  anyway.. thats some useless information to put in your pipes and smoke.. No, no woman; dont cry! ;)  GonzoGuerrilla Contributor 3 months ago “I was kinda sad at first. But then I remembered that Bob Marley song. NO, woman! NO cry! 😠”  GonzoGuerrilla Contributor 3 months ago How tf are there actually people who misunderstand this song so hard?! Seriously. It’s plain as day. He’s speaking to a woman, who is upset – sad – (it seems because Bob is going to be leaving and he is saying goodbye to her) and he is consoling her a bit, telling her to dry her tears and to not cry. The whole “Don’t cry because it’s over, smile because it happened” deal.  Like, jfc. It doesn’t take a degree in
No Woman No Cry- the irony of a song by a foreign philanderer, about the dynamics of men and women, being used to represent an isolationist country of feminists.
I instantly starting bawling my eyes out thinking about Chadwick 😢
Music transcends all boundaries. Spiritual link 🔗 up Bob Marley and Tems🇯🇲 ♥ 🇯🇲
Long Live Bob Marley… very iconic song 🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲

Listening to this track has made me realize how life is short,gotta live everyday go out there shine make memories live with no regrets @Tems nailed the cover
This song is so beautiful,  it had me crying, before I knew it. Chadwick Boseman will always be remembered in my heart and I'm quite sure others. God put him on this earth to do what he did. Even though I know Chadwick wouldnot want us to cry, I am going to have to shed some tears.❤️ This song is too beautiful not too💯
I'M NOT READY!!!!!😢😭😢😭😢  I wanted to see t'challa again after I graduated but 2020 had to ruin everything!!!

Beautiful. Made me cry.
Love Bob Marley 👏♥️
Wakanda forever 🙅🏽‍♂️🖤
Bob Marley would be proud! Gorgeous rendition!

I still wanna know who’s the smarty pants that put @temsbaby on @bobmarley ‘s song then transitioned it to @kendricklamar ‘s ???? Who DID IT. Then it comes on SLOW. Like cry now and smile later kind of shit. WHY🥹🥹🥹 huh???
Goosebumps!! 🥺
Rest in peace Chadwick Boseman and we will see you in Heaven one day. Thanks for playing Black Panther and thanks for the memories you share with us. God bless you and you impacted us with your life and your love.
Just got back from a vacation in Wakanda. Food:  7 Beach: 8 Shopping:  10  Bear in mind, the scale is 1-100.
"In my cultur, death is not the end."  T’Challa.
This song is now a hymn....Thank you...

Instant goosebumps. It's soooooo good
This is very bad grammar. But is so beautiful.
2:04 - 2:17 goddamn this is such a good part
Absolutely Epic
Who sings this version? It is magical
Where can i find the version from the trailer?
i love tems and tear up every time i hear this. there’s going to be a heavy emotional weight to this film. rip CB
Rest in peace, Emmet Till...There is no word for the parent who lost their children. No mother should have to bury her son in the shape of a broken corpse. Her tears were the tears of all Black parents, every mother, and father who were forced to sacrifice their children before the altar of hatred emanating from the colored (Blue, green, light brown) eyes of the white people. I was doing a report on Emmet Till's murder for school and I played this song as a tribute as I typed out my essay.
Been months and still listening to this music.
Everything's gonna be alright 😭
Who knew such a tranquil and beautiful song could be very empowering at the same time?  RIP Chadwick Boseman and Bob Marley. Wakanda Forever.
going have folks crying in the movies in less then a month
This voice tho! It’s magic
HUGE TRIBUTE TO BOB MARLEY & TRENCH TOWN, JAMAICA  🇯🇲.   TEMS WE LOVE ❤️ YOU IN JAMAICA....JUST LIKE WE LOVE KOFFEE & LILA IKE. & QUEEN IFRICA YOUR VIBES IS CONSCIOUS AND REAL. BLESS UP EVERY TIME...LITTLE EMPRESS...NUFF RESPECT.

The way they change the phrase  From : no woman, no cry To : no, woman, no cry  I'M CRYINGGGG
Rip chedrick boseman legends are remembere throughout the world its gonna be hard 😔
MARVEL,  PLEASE RELEASE THE MASHUP VERSION WITH ALRIGHT IN IT. PLEASE AND THANK YOU. WE NEED IT
I think of Chadwick when I hear this. Every time I remember he's gone it hurts. I also think of Latins being added into the movie, I am Black but I am SO moved by this gesture, I cry when I see the Indigenous Mexicans in the trailer. Such a beautiful tribute to Afro Futurism and Unity amongst other POC AND CHADWICK ❤️
One of the best cover
Such an amazing cover done by my tems 💯💯💯
This voice is as cool as ice, Tems is on another dimension
Wwwwwwcwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww1w
good friends we have  good friends we’ve lost   everything’s gonna be alright  everything’s gonna be alright   The best interpretation I’ve listen to so far and now it is my favourite.
this song vibe made me cried💔
I wish one of the Marley boys did the cover
We all love you Chadwick Boseman.Wakanda forever.😭😭😭
Evertng gn be alrg
RIP idol. Gracias por todo. Voy a disfrutar esta película hasta el último segundo #WakandaForever
I am Queen of the most powerful nation in the world, and my entire family is gone! Have I not given everything?!
I am so proud to be Jamaican😍😍😍Tems did such a good job👏
Good friends we’ve lost, along the way…. The way she sings this coupled with the moments in the trailer is just so hard not to be emotional
Rest in peace Chadwick 🙏 ❤️
Greatest artiste of all time taking over from Bob....long Live good music!!hits different
The mode of presentation of this song is moving and passes the message intended. I agree that this is a Grammy Award stuff. We wait to see.
I miss him and wish God is watching over him while they are playing to tribute to him and wakanda stands for
I love this song so much 🇯🇲 Big up Bob Marley a him create it 🇯🇲
Nice. R.I.P Bob Marley a The legend of legends❤️.💚.💛
Was just released back on June 1st this year and I'm stuck in a federal halfway house struggling to find a way forward but this song and her voice gives me the hope that I need
She makes me happy 🇳🇬 FROM JAPAN WITH BIG LOVE ❤
That's true If U have woman u r gonna cry 😅
Wakanda forever hermano 👍 fuiste un gran rey
Tems killed this song. Soulful.🔥
Tantas emociones que transmite.
MCU Phase 4 is a Legend 😭🙌🏻: Black Widow Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings Eternals Spider-Man: No Way Home Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness Thor: Love and Thunder Black Panther: Wakanda Forever
This song makes you do exactly what it asks you not to do.
Rest in power, King.
Can't get enough of this song I'm for ever listening to it each an every morning 🔥🔥🔥😍😍
Everything is gonna be alright 😢😢 R.I.P CHADWICK BOSEMAN😭❤️
Tears everywhere 🥺
Chadwick was for the African community what Spider-Man was to me growing up. To this day I still don’t believe that he’s gone. Like we’ve awaken in a different timeline. One that’s not supposed to exist. I hope that this movie can respectfully handover his legacy to whoever is next in line. (Obviously being Shuri)
The themes of Wakanda forever is political hence the song! perfect song!
Alguien sabe donde puedo conseguir el Cover de Marvel?
Only the son hit me so hard, I can't imagine the hole movie. Always in our memories Chadwick
Need songs like this on the radio
Bob Marley & tems omg 😢
Who's crying😭😭
Bob Marley created a beautiful freedom song 🇯🇲 Great rendition by Tems! ❤️
May the King continue resting in peace.
Esta mejor la de Santa Fe
Love
So u couldnt write a song ?  why sing over drug addict song ?
Yeeeeeebooooooo 😭😭😭🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
AA here. Listening to TEMS beautifully cover an iconic song by the great Bob Marley is wild. Using that song in the sequel honoring the incomparable Chadwick Boseman is just next level. African, Caribbean, and African American. See what happens when we cut the bullshit out bw us all? We’re the greatest fucking force ever known. Big up to my brothers and sisters in the diaspora wherever you are. Know that you are valuable and needed. Love y’all.🖤
fire
Eu creio vai ser o melhor da Marvel 😔   Só a trilha sonora do trailer matou a pau 👏👏👏
tems is singing no woman no cry but while listening to it am crying 😔😔but we are gonna alright some day
It is 2022 and my Grammy passed away in 2005 from breast cancer. This song makes me cry of happy memories when she wasn’t sick and we did things like visit the sand dunes in Colorado. Oh how I miss her. 😔
Tems ❣😟
BLACK PANTHER WAKANDA FOREVER is going to great
The pisces in me just know I’m going to cry when the movie come out .
nobody better to sing this cover but tems love her so much☺☺☺
Bro tems’s voice is something else
Tems got me in my feelings! I'm here shedding tears as I Iisten to this song. As a Nigerian I'm so proud of you! 🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬 Rest in power Bob🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲 and Chadwick🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
I shall cry this very day😭
Big up Jamaica ...to the world...big up Tems for covering  one of  Jamaica's best Bob Marley's  song !
My God My God...this song 🤎✊🏾
This hurts 😭😭😥😭😭
I am not prepped for this movie  but I cant" wait for this movie I  love Chadwick Boesman rest in peace Chadwick
Temssss
What a righteous remake she made it sound easy
I’m going to bawling in the theatre. This song already makes me want to.
I cant wait for Iron Heart MCU debut
I wish it was the same mix of songs and sounds as from the trailer, it's so fucking cool!
Rest in power Her majesty, Queen Elizabeth ll. You will be remembered with deep respect ✊.
Tems brings another colour to this wonderful rendition 🌄👍
BEAUTIFUUUUUUUL!!!!!!! What We Bring Always!
big ups from Am. Samoa in Sept. 2022!!
🇯🇲 will live forever
Bob wouldn't be impressed it sounds like a little lord of the rings mixed into it remember there are a lot of white people producing this and I'm white just ain't right
Can't wait for Wakanda Forever! Tem's voice is so soothing.
tem....fire & nuff respect on this version....wow
Tems am your number one fan, I can't get enough of that voice
Goodbye, T'Challa... Goodbye, Chadwick Boseman...😔😔😔😔😔😔
This song hits hard
This will be my funeral song
I know I would be crying while watching this movie. 🥺🥺🥺
Such a incredible song😭😭😭😭
Rest In Peace Chadwick Boseman and Bob Marley 🕊
This is for Chadwick Bozeman 🥺😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔 WAKANDA FOREVER 🥺😭
"I am the Queen of most powerful nation in the world and my entire family is gone, Have I Not given everything " it feels like Africa talking to the world...."everything I love has been taken from me, have I not given enough?
Chadwick Boseman, Forever! Long Live The King. #BlackPanther was, is, the best Marvel movie ever.
So dry your tears i say
Special song for my Jamaican born self
Beautiful song, I heard this on the Wakanda Forever trailer it was a very good trailer and this is a very nice song!
Thank you Tems for this redention of Bob Marley's no woman no cry - big up from Jamaica !
Man I'm emotional now.... goosebumps hearing this song originally from sir Bob but this with Kendrick twist is quite magnificent 😭😭😭🔥🔥
❤
bob Marley was an amazing writer indeed
SUPERBE!!!!CHADWICK FOR EVER!!!!!
Just like Hurt by Nine Inch Nails became a Johnny Cash's song forever, I think No Woman, No Cry has become Tems' song forever. She completely has redefined and reset the song in my opinion. Come Oscar time, if they dont expand the Best Original Song category to simply Best Song, it would be criminal because this must be acknowledged for its greatness.
Debulhando em lágrimas neste exato momento
Pure love🖤🖤
TEMS 🥰
Bob Marley’s song…….
Chad went far too soon but what he did in his time will live on Wakanda foreva and ever
This about to mess me up huh?
I think we all know this movie is gonna be one of the best of all time
Wow and I love this song
Teme cover is therapeutic. This is what we call soul good.
Music is of bob marley ?!?!?
Cry I an I Drop me soul  No sun shall rise  Pon the altar Freedom him say  Freedom him sang Emancipation waits We come down  We come down  Humble to the last  Every ting Every ting Me say e’ry ting G’won be Irie Cry I am I  Wakanda Far Iva
Rest up King. We are gonna flood the theater like no other. All white. The ancestors have returned. We have awake n
Beautiful. Perfectly sums up the loss of our king and the efforts to continue his legacy.
Stan Lee and Chadwick Boseman would be very proud. Even if though they are no longer here but both legends will still be in our hearts. No matter what.
Já podem dar um prêmio por trilha sonora, pq está F.... demais
if u see this in 2070 remember me I was here in 2022.🙌
This version is  giving me goose bumps.. shessh
Beautiful.  Soulful. Rich flavour. Silk smooth 👏 👏 👏 👏 👏
It touches my heart I grew up hearing this song through school. Keeps my mom going.
Such a beautiful voice. I got chills
It's as if she believes what she is singing......
Big up bob marley blessings follow #Tems
The only gift that marvel can give us is by bringing back Erick kill monger
Bob would be proud. Excellent cover. This rendition touched my soul. Our ancestors are listening.
I just wanna say to Marvel   "Don't fuck this up"
Too bad that Chadwick Boseman isn’t going to be on the stage for even Since technoblade has passed away.
❤❤❤❤❤😭
It this song for me
When my foster mom pass away she always said "everything is going be alright" ❤️😭❤️😭❤️
I HAVE SEEN JAMES BOND IN THE TRAILER.
This is beautiful, but where are the drums and the transition with Kendrick? Please.
No woman no cry, No ganja we die~~~🎶🎶🎶
We miss you Chadwick. Wakanda Forever, always
R.I.P Chadwick Bozeman 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔🥺
Can’t wait to see this gem
nitip sendal, bagus banget lagunya. nanti balik lagi kalo di tempat kita tiba-tiba trending seperti lagu lainnya yang sudah sudah
This movie is going to be very emotional!
Everything is gonna alright
Afff mano 🥺😭✊🏼 essa música é incrível e vemos bem o enredo do filme

As a Jamaican, we love Tems version of this great song done by the greatest Bob marley
Bov marly
Wakanda Forever!  For Chadwick Boseman
Powerful song...nicely done💪🏼
Everythings gonna be alrights😞
2 years since his passing… I still can’t believe it…
Esa canción es muy fuerte todo el mundo extrañará a Chadwick boseman xd viva black panter
😍😍😍😍
Solo brividi....💜💛
Esa voz es melodía pura. La ame me relaja me transporta. ❤️
Marvel Cinematic Universe Phase 4: Black Widow Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings Eternals Spider-Man: No Way Home Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness Thor: Love and Thunder Black Panther: Wakanda Forever
I will see Black Panther: Wakanda Forever in Black Friday
Like he never left...
Extremely Somber reflection….
This is already my new favorite song! #WakandaForever
Her voice is what I imagine an angel sounds like ughh black women are just gifted 😩🤌🏽
Chadwick FOREVER 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
She put a beautiful touch to an already perfect song. Great job.
She did that song!
Tems got one AMAZING voice.
The Kendrick mash up cannot be topped.
Es de los trailers mas hermosos que he visto.  La musica, las escenas, ese dialogo de la reina, las escenas de Namor, sublime y exquisito para la vista y los oidos. Espero que la película sea igual de perfecta.
If she can’t be nominated for an Oscar since this is a cover, I could see her singing this for the In Memoriam segment. It would be beautiful. I think our King T’Challa would approve.
Wakanda Forever 🙅🏻‍♂️🙅🏻‍♂️
que linda versión del gran Bob Marley , pero quisiera saber quien hizo esta linda versión para esta película. alguien ?
This song is a classic. Like tems take on it Jamaica Forever🇯🇲❤️#Bobmarley
Jesus this cover cuts deep. Brilliant
Damn I got goosebumps and tears in my eyes! 😭
Please specify in the title that it is a Bob Marley song
🧡❤💜💙
I just can not wait till the movie comes out 🙌🏽 Tems voice really just brought out the essence of this song for the movie. This cover is amazing 🥰 I listen to it daily.
When bob Marley hits to your heart yet in 2022.😍
Proud to be an American 🇺🇸
Please for the love of god release the original remix 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Tems is amazing,  my Naija sister
It will provide emotion that we black Americans have never felt
No lie, I've never looked forward to seeing a movie as much as I await this 😩
Amazing Song
"this connects with me so much" WAKANDA FOREVER
Everything's gonna be alright 😊
W. F.😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
wakanda forever!
Not Gon lie when I heard Slow down by Skip Marley and HER I was like damnn imagine if Bob Marley was still alive now hearing this Im tryn not to shed a tear thinking about it again with so much going on in this world we def need Bob Marley back
Love this!!!! also want to hear that remix with Kendric!!
antony lubanga 💥wuod nyalenda
❤️❤️❤️magnifique
😢
❤️ Everything gone be  alright ❤️
The irony that I’m bawling listening to this
Been on repeat 🔁 4 days now
Long Live the King of Wakanda  #WakandaForever
Tems' voice is so amazing and I love her voice but her voice seems so watered down for this song.  I wished the producers who worked on her album worked on this song. It's so important to keep what made you special and unique.  I think had the producer used Tems' style of singing to her full extent, she would have did what Whitney Houston did with Chaka Khan's I'm every woman. Both versions get constant play on the radio. I think Bob's version will be on heavy rotation.
This is the type of thing where Men may cry. Rip Chadwick
This gonna be new movie about black panther wakanda forever without Chadwick boseman 🙏
Why so soon,
Why Chadwick, why???
E-G-B-A
I’m so Proud to be a black woman!! #ProudJamaican🇯🇲. Forever❤️ @bobmarley, thanks🥰 @TEMS indeed amazing Nuff love from yaad
So much pain
this song makes me wanna cry. so powerful!
This movie Will make me cry TOO MUCH i feel so strongly different emotions 😩 🥹
a melodia ficou o auge de triste
This go have grown thugs crying 😔😔
Just imagining myself watching this movie and this song comes on😭 RIP chadwick
🔥🔥🔥🔥
You're deeply missed,  Chadwick(King of Wakanda).  😭😭😭 Knowing you'll not be in the Black Panther 2 makes even sadder.
Wakanda forever
Nothing is tight without you sir Chadwick boseman 😭
Bob Nesta Marley—wherever lies his gentle soul—must be smiling, because Tems sang with hers. How euphonic  is this. ❤️
Nothing gone be alright 💤😶
listening to this masterpiece while reading through the comments
I wish they just used the original song by Bob Marley, this is just disrespectful to the legend
🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲
Flawless wow
The sound track makes you feel the ancestors
This movie will crush
🔥🔥🔥🔥🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪 Chadwick Boseman Forever in our Hearts and Big shout out to my Homie Lupita Nyongo Kisumu kenya
TEMS!!!!!!!!💗💗💗💗💗
Terms did a great job with her vocals in this song
All  the lyrics... The voice... everything Goose bumps 🤦
I just bumped into her music randomly. Now she is all I've being playing lately. A beautiful woman with a beautiful voice. Can't wait to see how far she goes.
Damn 1:52 & 2:12🌹❤️❤️❤️
😭😭😭
Bob marley 💚💛❤
Am I the only one that starts crying when hearing this song😞
My edit with this song: https://youtu.be/__h72vBw_a8
We need this on Sportify
This song is so therapeutic..nice one tems Bob Marley  must be so proud.Wakanda forever 😌💥
Everything's gonna be alright.....❤
Damnn Tems killed this. It’s so emotional but I also have a feeling that there is a small bit of happiness in this song. Congrats Tems this is a masterpiece. Bob would be proud. And as a Jamaican I love this 🇯🇲!!!
Because of this song, I’ve got a prediction for the movie  It opens with a funeral for T’Challa and this will be playing during it.
i love this as much as i love the original.
She speaks fax
Marvel has become WOKE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
El rey vive
Perfect
Isn’t it crazy that Bob Marley also lost his life through cancer? So poetic
This song make me strong 🙂
Rest in Peace King  https://youtube.com/shorts/sTwu3d12nzo?feature=share
2:23 this part is the best
I wonder if Marvel Studios will reveal how T’Challa dies as a character in Wakanda Forever or will it just be mentioned passively without a cause. Maybe A flashback of Namor causing it? Going to be interesting how they tackle real world to on screen character.
Oh so do I love Nigeria 🇳🇬 ❤️
No cry 😢
It did not say no man no cry. So It's ok for me
Heart touched 🖤
#ChadwickForever ✊

Cette chasons💖 J'ai pas les mots😊 J'aime trop
This song is made for this future movie
Tems and wizkid covers are one of my favourite cover for this masterpiece.
Gonna miss Wakanda Forever by CHADWICK BOSEMAN
Chills!!!! 💜🔥🙌🏾🥹
"In Memory of Chadwick Boseman, 1976-2020. Wakanda Forever"
I gotta give Marvel props for not just recasting T'Challa and honoring Chadwick Boseman by retiring the character with him. It's honestly kinda ballsy, not exactly the safe corporate choice.
This song makes me cry
Finally Marvel Comes out with a serious Movie ..hope this is not like other comic movies .. the last dark and serious superhero movie i loved was Zach Snyder's Justice League...
No woman, no cry No woman, no cry I remember when we used to sit In a government yard in Trenchtown Ob-observing the hypocrites Mingle with the good people we meet Good friends we have and good friends we've lost Along the way In this great future, you can't forget your past So dry your tears, I say No woman, no cry No woman, no cry 'Ere, little darlin', don't shed no tear No woman, no cry Said, I remember when we used to sit In a government yard in Trenchtown And then Georgie would make the fire light as it was Log would burnin' through the night Then we would cook cornmeal porridge Of which, I share with you My feet is my only carriage Though I've got to push on through So while I'm gone Everything's gonna be alright Everything's gonna be alright Everything's gonna be alright, now Everything's gonna be alright Everything's gonna be alright Everything's gonna be alright Everything's gonna be alright, now Everything's gonna be alright So woman, no cry Cry, cry No woman (no woman, no cry), no No woman, no cry, no cry No woman, no cry
I'd like to believe that Mr. Marley's smiling about this.   IMO the Live versions that we're captured of he and the whaler’s performances top this rendition. I wouldn't like to call it cover. It is so VERY well done. Similarly to “Disturbed’s” take of Sound of Silence.
I make a lumi the black panter. Watch here please! https://youtube.com/shorts/5sdCgA9rNXc?feature=share
Tems is a god.
Everything's gonna be alright
I really love this so much❤️❤️🥺
wheres the one from the trailer with kendric lamar ?
Bob Marley would've given a standing ovation for this beautiful rendition 👏🏽. #onelove Tems
Her voice reminds me of Lauryn hill of figures with her cover on killing me softly. This is amazing
I believe it might be her voice, tone and style topped off with her poise that just makes this cover so astonishing! My goodness.😑
This song made me cry in person. It's beautiful.
Tems did justice here. Looking forward to November but I know its gon be emotional.
Goosebumps, you are destined for greatness Temilade
no women no cry, by bob the ugly l.i.z.za.rd   liz🦕🐍.zar.d wrote that song,becuz they can't create their own kind, for that they need  Women, human Women,that's how they breeding their kind. so of there is no Women then there will be generation of humans ...a example : a women hold everything of a family if she is not here then family will fall.but Women children will Win. 🪔  now does it sound fimilar to bible history of Eve and serpent histroy, as God make enmity between Her seed and snake seed(they even with Eve gene).  Her seed will Win. deceptionist  must fall  that's why they make no women no cry becuz Mother childs vs snakes,that what going on.  bob marley:(de.m.on.ic li.zz.a.rd)
I love this song so much and the way  tems sings. This song is mingling in my head ....
Wakanda forever 😭😢😭😢😭
😢
2:10-2:17 this moment gets me every time 🌅
Pride of Africans
Revelation of GOD: IAM WHOLLY IAM VALTEZ TELPHARAOH IAM THE BIRTH ROOT OF KING DAVID IAM ANTONIO VALTEZ TELPHARAOH TOLIVER IAM JESUS CHRIST. ENS REALE -IAMGOD

This is one of those songs that you look back at life and remember all the good memories you had.
this is gonna be my fav song all the time
Holy shit the trailer hit me different
Most definitely gonna cry when this movie comes out and I hear this song. It makes you think of Chadwick 😭🖤
This Song will forever remind me of the good friends I've known yet lost through the past years, yet also i still carry that song for my aunt in Congo. Whatever this song represents to you... let that be a song of hope and encouragement.🙏🙏❤❤
Can't believe 2 yrs ago we saw chadwik in endgame. Now hes gone. WAKANDA FOREVER. RIP STAN LEE AND CHADWIK

Beautiful cover...
Amani kwa wingi☺️✌️
Got me holding back tears because I miss Bob Marley and Chadwick Boseman and didn't know either of them personally.  That's what true icons do, they make you feel as if you knew them without even trying.  Bless Tems and the Marley and Boseman families. ❤
as a Antiguan american i love this rendition of bob marley's no woman no cry it is a wonderful track
Chadwick Boseman R.I.P. "The King, The Avenger, The Black Panther Forever"
This song will let us not forget that Chadwick Boseman is a one true king of wakanda and the one and only BLACK PANTHER , this movie will makes us in tears and respect the king , Rest in power Chadwick , we will keep your legacy forward , you can rest now ..🥲🥲
When I heard this song it just reminding me back of father memories
It sounds so sad 😭
Y'all about to make us cry aaah no😭
Si 👏
Wow nice Bob Marley cover
Looked this song up and found out it’s my baby tems 😂love the cover song
Nigeria to the World 🌍 🇳🇬
tems voice omg
This music tribute for Chadwick boseman
Tems Tems Tems, out of words to describe this beautiful African lady. Everything on point,big up from JAMAICA 🇯🇲
Powerful rendering of the epic song.. RiP Chad...
Wow
I don't know what we have in our life !! When she says " in this future you can't forget your past " so, its related to us 🖤 this is an emotion for chadwick sir and I will miss him until my dead and in future i am going to tell my children about him "the real king of wakanda 🖤"
AYO!!!!! THEY ACTUALLY RELEASED THE FULL VERSION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YES!!!
Bro I cried to this because black panther is my favorite marvel then when my dad told me he died I didn’t believe him then I realized then I started to cry I’m like his biggest fan I wish he never died I would bring him back instead of $999M and that’s on god. RIP Chadwick🙏🏾❤️🥺 WAKANDA FOREVER🐈‍⬛
My soul cry's, I'm crying right now. I'm hurt, I'm broken, destroyed by what life has taught me all the way to 30, I've lost 8 of my best friends to suicide and deaths by alcohol or drinking and driving. My soul hurts every single day. I wish they where here th hear this, they'd love it, but I know I have to stay strong and continue our legacy of friendship... It just get so hard...I'm trying...bone love  Edit I'm the only one left...
Tems is really everything I love her voice so much a masterpiece bless her soul
Hit me in the guts this one😭
This music makes me forget who I am. I am a PROUD descendant of African heritage so I need to embrace my culture more. I'm sure this movie will do justice. I've never heard of Tems but she truly killed the African aesthetic.
🌍🌍🌍🌍🌍🌍🌍🌍🌍🌍🌍🌍🌍
Well done Tems
So emotional
☺️😌🥲
Goosebumps moment when she says " Everything's gonna be alright"
We may have lost Chadwick and lost king tchalla but don’t worry be happy. He’s here in spirit and don’t forget what he did . Everything’s gonna be alright , we may have lost good friends along the way but don’t worry be happy just remember everything is gonna be alright . No human no cry , yes human yes happiness
A proud Jamaican, Love hearing our music 😁🇯🇲
Love it , so glad she did not change the words. Can’t wait for the movie # Love Bob Marley # Love Chadwick Boseman, RIP❤️🙏🏽🙏🏽
How i have always felt over the years despite my age
Amazing version tems has an angelic voice 😇🔥
Marvel studios black panther wakanda forever
This is an amazing cover. Tems did an excellent job. Sooo proud of her!!! 🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬
there‘s just something about this song that makes me tear up every time i hear it. i cant listen to it in public lmao😭 tems voice is so so beautiful
Avengers Endgame Tamil Redubbed To Iron Man ,Ravi Shankar voice
Really nice but I wanted the Kendrick mix
I’m going to see the movie in all white as Wakandan Culture
This version is so beautiful! Impossible not to cry remembering our eternal Black Panther
Yes Yes Yes.
This is a flawess rendition by Tems, u did justice to this song by Bob Marley (G.O.A.T.), they'd be so proud SIP Bob & Chadwick.    I am really proud to be a Jamaican listening to this song on repeat done by an African sister.   "I remember when we use to sit ina government yaad in Trench Town. Oba-Obaserving the hypocrites, mingle with good ppl we meet.  Good friends we have & good friends we have lost,  along the way, in this (GREAT FUTURE YOU CANT FORGET YOUR PAST), so dry your tears I say.    "No woman no cry, no woman no cry, hey little darling dont shed no tears no woman no cry".    Sending love to you from Jamaica to Africa One Love & everything gonna be alright.
Bob Marley would've been proud.
New ringtone 💕💥💫
Sensacional!
Tems is the Queen 🖤🖤🖤
Beautiful song
Deep pain meets smiling hope - that's this song.
First FF7 now wakanda
YASSSS🤍🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
Nah man she's Elite 🙏🏿🤧
well🥺
Rest In Peace Chadwick, let known that all of which who have been here have loved you and your work. Wakanda Forever.
❤
This song is fantastic it is a roller coaster of emotions thumbs up for Tem's the queen am proud to be African
Always wondered why Bob Marley said "Oba observing ...." I thought it was just a stretching out of the lyrics for the melody; I looked up the word "Oba" on doctor Google 🙂 and found that it means "ruler" in Nigerian. They couldn't have chosen a better theme song. RIP Bob and Chadwick❤
Wacounda forever
Black Panther soundtracks are always so goated.
Ooobumbeh!!!! 🖤🤎🖤🤎
I know can’t play this while driving someone gonna catch me at a stop light in my feelings… 😭
Great Music ! #bobmaley 💓💓💓💓💓
🥲🥰❤
Wakanda Forever. Chadwick Forever. 🙅🏻‍♂️
No Woman No Man could not cry in this song
Am feeling like Bob Marley in his grave... Happy and Loved
Where's the epic version? 😭
<33
Didn’t know it was already out 🥺💜 this got me in my feels
I want to see every black super hero across the Marvel Multiverse fight together to this song.
Naija to the world 💕
WAKANDA FOREVER 🥺🖤🖤💔💔🙅🏻‍♀️
Tems really made the lyrics hit so hard. Love all this attention for you my love. Higher and Higher. And every time I watch this trailer, I'm a mess.
dem know how much Jamaican people they good have gotten to sing this or even a member of the Marley's
Rest Easy Chadwick
Vocês sempre me surpreendendo, ótima escolha da música,  muito ansioso para assistir  e emocionar com essa obra prima! 😭😭😭😭👏👏👏
I'ma Chad Wick left a legacy. he's my hero . He's my inspiration 🙏🏻🙏🏻✊✊✊✊✊✊✊ May his soul rest in peace
Such an amazing soulful feel-good ballad This song debuted at number 1 on *BILLBOARD World digital song sales chart* TEMS totally deserves
I have a feeling this sequel is going to make me cry. Tems really outdid herself on this cover.
Am i tripping or was this a dope naughty by nature / wyclef jean / kendrick lamar mashup in the trailer ? 😱😱😱
masterpiece
This song is a gem 💎 incredible performance Tems.
Mad jam from the beautiful tems, naija na vibe,
Why is it looking like throwback is better than the present day?  Legacy lives on
Wakanda forever ❤️
Esta canción es de anuel
I will bring tissues in my bag into theater later
Oh my god oh my god oh my god😭😭😭😭😍😍😍😍🙌🙌🙌🙌😘😘😘😘🙆🙆🙆🙆
This reminds me of my grand mother. A strong black woman who suffered and died from cancer. she kept the family together until the very end. never complained. Never needed or wanted pity from no one. Kept a smile on her face and fed us all. 10 children on her own as husband was away working. Sometimes leaving herself undone. Although she was the one dying she had so much concern for all in their struggles. I can see her beautiful face with this song.
Congratulations Tems! Proudly Nigerian! 💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬
African Artistes on the rise...Unstoppable!!!!
Okay, repeat for 2-3 weeks straight now.
SONG OF THE YEAR!!!!
No, woman, no cry No, woman, no cry  I remember when a we used to sit In a government yard in Trenchtown, Observing the hypocrites Mingle with the good people we meet Good friends we have, oh, good friends we have lost Along the way In this great future, you can't forget your past So dry your tears, I seh  No, woman, no cry No, woman, no cry A little darlin', don't shed no tears: No, woman, no cry  Said I remember when we used to sit In the government yard in Trenchtown And then Georgie would make the fire lights, I seh, logwood burnin' through the nights Then we would cook cornmeal porridge, say, Of which I'll share with you My feet is my only carriage And so I've got to push on through Oh, while I'm gone,  Everything's gonna be all right Everything's gonna be all right Everything's gonna be all right now Everything's gonna be all right  Everything's gonna be all right Everything's gonna be all right Everything's gonna be all right now Everything's gonna be all right  No, woman, no cry ah~ No, woman no (no woman no cry) no~  No, woman, no cry No cry~  No, woman, no cry  hmm~ ouuuu~``
Randomly played on my Apple Music playlist and halfway I was cryingb😭😭😭 idk why
😉
🇯🇲
Bob Marleys version is still the best.
🇯🇲UNITY🇳🇬
August 2 , 2022 = 1.5M
they need to do a live performance of this....
chose the perfect chords
hats off to bob marley and his lyrics.
This version of this song gives me chills!!! I love it! It’s on repeat.
I'm crying y'all
I recently lost my beautiful sister to a stage 4 cancer a few weeks ago.  Listening to this track by Tems, actually made me cry.  I miss her dearly.
Proof the Bob Marley is from the future probably the multiverse.
And the song and meaning. Gets better and still hit hard for all today. Bless you who sees this. Keep the peace and good vibes out there. You got this. Ill see you all soon. Cheers.
Beautiful... I love her voice!
Love tems😍😍
PERFECTION🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺 it's giving HOPE 💝💝.
This movie will be epic. I can't wait to watch it and cry my heart out.
I'm feelin goosebumps, literally 🖤
I'm taken to tears... not for a loss but a hero Chadwick is to the youths in the African community. Tems nails it on the performance and dries the tears I shed to one of Bob Marley's greatest soul eating hits. This is a lot to take in when you listen and pay tribute to two great guys the world knows; Chadwick and Bob... then the melodious voice Tems offers. Indeed WAKANDA FOREVER !!
I'm crying.
💜
Fucking masterpiece 🥺❤
Tudo vai ficar bem 🙏🏽🙏🏾🙏🏿🙏🏻
Miss u king ❤️
This movie will be in so many different ways 😞
Rest In Peace tchala ✊🏿✊🏿✊🏿
i cry
Everything's gonna be alright!✊🏽 Wakanda forever!🙅🏽‍♂️
SO. MUCH. EMOTION!!!  Goosebumps!!!!

Big Credit Bob Marley 🇫🇯
My favorite song by Bob Marley, beautiful rendition from Tems ✨truly fit for a Queen👑
For those who are hearing this song for the first time this is a cover of the legendary Jamaican singer Bob Marley's No Woman No Cry.
Queen Ramonda perfectly suits this. She has everything of the world but nothing of her own.
Simplesmente lindo ❤🖤
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is definitely not gonna be a funny movie seriously, it's gonna be a super serious and a super important movie ever for Chadwick Boseman. Plz show respect
Hey    If you are here in 2090, I was here in 2022. Tems was a very talented female artist from Nigeria with a special unique voice . Her remake of "No woman no Cry " by legendary Bob Marley ( Do well to check Bob Marley's songs )was so emotional . Hope the world is a better place in 2090? Stay safe  and be a nice human .
My Sister died in 2020 . Same year as Chadwick . When i hear this song i cant hold it together .
Eterno bob ❤️
Absolutely beautiful
😭😭
Tems baby has gone international.
So proud of Temiladeee🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬
Quien canta?
Thanks for posting this full version. 🥺 I’m so full of emotion
Lindo trabalho Marvel... RIP pantera
She gives me goosebumps
Naija to the World 🌍
She's just awesome amazing voice
She's just awesome amazing voice
Hey Me in 2050 This is a comment to remind you in 2050 that this was the greatest black movie in 2022❤️

RIP 💐
🙏❤
bonito demais jesus
This is the song that makes me to think about the things life has taken from me.it deep very deep 😭
This song, I tell you Bob Marley's version will always be the best. The Original but this version equals the passion and emotion shared by the original.  Jah give thanks and praise to Our Queens.
Eterno pantera 😔🎶
Mistura de sentimentos com essa versão da música. Arrepia, dá vontade de chorar e ao mesmo tempo passa paz e esperança.
This isn't just a song, this is emotion, loss and hope
Love you Chadwick boseman 😔😍😍 miss you 😘🥰
Wakanda Forever to rejuvenate, revitalize the Marvel universe, because lately they've been missing with them Thor L&T , DrS2, Venom 2, Morbius
❤❤❤💛💛💛💚💚💚 ❤❤❤💛💛💛💚💚💚 ❤❤❤💛💛💛💚💚💚
For this to come out on Jamaica’s 60th year of independence is such a satisfying coincidence too 😭✨ Such a small island but it's like we’re sprinkled everywhere 🇯🇲 Brb gonna cry
best cover in a very very long time! what an improvement!
Tems got an enchanting voice!
This Bob Marley's Song Hits different Now 🥺🔥
Its true when Bob Marley said “ When music hits you , you feel no pain “ .
where is the trialer song with the rap in it
this song feels like the kind of hugs my granny gives me 🥺💗
Bob wrote the song as tribute to Africa, Mandela and those victims during South Africa's apartheid. The great himself would've been so proud of Tems covering it, even more emotionally.🇳🇬 🇯🇲 🙏🏾
Tems sound like a young lauryn hill 😌
Beautiful👍
Before watching the teaser I complained about not recasting Tchalla but when I saw the teaser I changed my mind. It made me realise that there's no Tchalla without Chadwick Boseman. This film's gonna hit hard. The teaser was enough to made me shed a tear. #WakandaForever #RipTchalla
Tems!!   What a beautiful Ode to the legendary Bob Marley with his very own classic !   It can’t get better than this!   👊🏾🇳🇬👊🏾🇳🇬!
I'm not crying, you are 😭💔 RIP Chadwick 🥀🕊️
nothings  gonna be alright 😥😥😥😭
Obrigada Tems, por este cover incrível, virou meu favorito. 🥺 Esse tbm foi o teaser mais emocionante e bonito que a Marvel já fez   Para sempre em nossos corações Chadwick Boseman🖤
Bob Marley would be proud to hear this sing over  🇯🇲

Se eu falar que estou apaixonada e pouco!!!  Que trabalho musical maravilhoso desse filme.  ❤👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 Ansiosa para assitir.
In an attempt to expand my musical horizons I loaded up YT top 50 music vids of the week and let it play. This WAY stuck out. The only good thing about most of the other stuff was that they wouldn't show up on David Duke's play list.
I love tems rendition of this powerful song 🇯🇲 🇯🇲 the great Bob Marley
WAKANDA FOREVER 🫶🏻❤️

This song already has a strong feeling, and after listening to it along with the phrase the queen says, about losing her whole family, it gets even stronger.
Lyrics:  No, woman, no cry No, woman, no cry  I remember when we used to sit In the government yard in Trenchtown Oba, observing the hypocrites Mingle with the good people we meet Good friends we have and good friends we've lost Along the way In this great future, you can't forget your past So dry your tears I say  No woman, no cry No woman, no cry 'Ere, little darlin', don't shed no tears No, woman, no cry  Said I remember when we used to sit In the government yard in Trenchtown And then Georgie would make the fire light, as it was A log wood burning through the night Then we would cook corn meal porridge Of which I'll share with you My feet is my only carriage No, I've got to push on through But while I'm gone  Everything's gonna be alright Everything's gonna be alright Everything's gonna be alright now Everything's gonna be alright Everything's gonna be alright Everything's gonna be alright Everything's gonna be alright now Everything's gonna be alright So woman, no cry, cry, cry No, woman, no (Woman, no) So woman, no cry, no cry No, woman, no cry  Hmm Ooh Ooh

I lost my mom last year and she was a massive fan of Chadwick and all the Dora! This was woman who never read a comic book in her life. I know I would’ve taken her  to the theater to see this!  I also know Imma need a lot of tissues!
RIP our king Chadwick boseman 😔 You are our only king. Wakanda forever!
Que versão maravilhosa para um dos filmes mais emocionantes e lindos já aguardado.
I can't stop listening
Now that's how you make a cover she took over this legendary song and made it unique once again WITHOUT taking the essence out of it. So much respect !
This Movie Definitely Gonna Hit Different #RIP Chadwick Boseman 🙏🏾🕊️🕊️🕊️ #WakandaForever

😢🙏🏽🤴🏾 MY KING‼
goodbye chad don't cry don't shed no tiers
this is a bop
Truly beautiful. Takes me all the way back to 2018 and feels very emotional. I am sure this movie will be incredible and a great tribute to late Chadwick Boseman. In 2020, we lost a great warrior but most importantly an amazing kind and loving person. May his soul rest in peace while we honor his legacy.
🖤🖤
流れ出た涙が心を洗浄する。
Ok but while listening to No Woman No Cry I’m yes woman yes cry 😭
Bob marley song hits different.. no one will forget your legendary songs..
Where’s the duet?
Stunning rendition.  Bob would be proud 👏
Brilliant. But better then Bob? Hmm

Tears 😢😢😢
🔥🙌
oh my god i'm crying on the floor
Estoy orgulloso de Santa Fe Klan preste su voz al soundtrack de la Película Wakanda Forever para Latinoamérica, pero hay que ser sinceros y admitir, claro, sin demeritar su trabajo y todo lo que ha conseguido el rapero... pero este soundtrack original es mucho mejor y de lo mejor que he escuchado....
Surreal!
Trying to hold back the tears 😭 This hits hard, just like the trailer did. Beautifully done Tems! 💕 Damn, I miss Chadwick aka King T’Challa. 😔
Beautiful!! 😇
Cheers 🍷
RIP Bob Marley and Chadwick Boseman
Tems is a angel guarantee you
This was fabulous by TEMS.    I hope some gives this link to  Coogler or KDOT.   Marvel be bold and brave  this song should be on the sound track https://youtu.be/DJ9qeDTVJ74

Great, marvels first snuff film scored by a cheap bob Marley remake. How unoriginally horrible
🇺🇬🇺🇬🇺🇬 Africa getting recognized....I hope 🤞 she perfoms this at the Oscars
I preferred the one on the trailer to this
Y’all picked the perfect singer for this❤️
Black Panther legit has the best soundtrack in Marvel
this just became one of my favorite versions after bob marley's and boney m
Disappointed only at the fact that "When I wake up" isn't a part of this. Felt like an awesome change of pace or detour.
Can we please cut out any LGBT scene that will be in the movie? Right now, Marvel just keep going downhill cuz of these WOKE shit.  We dont need em. Stop that. Let this movie be the tribute for Chadwick, not the LGBTQs shit.  Let the world keep missing Chadwick's legacy.
I'm so glad that I now know who owns the soulful, stellar voice behind the song. I loved the original and I love this version.
"When I stand before God at the end of my life, I would hope that I would not have a single bit of talent left, and could say, 'I used everything you gave me'. "    - *Chadwick Boseman*
Chadwick: A spirit so powerful
Such talent! I remember watching the trailer and wondering whose voice it was. Keep soaring, Tems!
🎶Bob Marley- no woman no cry🎶original song 🇯🇲 🎶🎶
This song made feel like ...... a strange feeling, it's like flying while crying
Tems is just so so good Lauryn Hill on my mind.
U can  smell the Oscar a stone throw away for 'best soundtrack'
💗💗💗💗💗💗💗
WE GON BE ALRIGHT
Tems Baby! 🙌
I’m sorry to say but it’s too better than original one
play 1.25 is very good omg

TEMS has been blessed with a gift please use continually for good
Just wonderful! RIP Chad! ☺

Big up uno self people ❤️from Jamaica 🇯🇲🫰🏼🙏🏾💯❤️❤️
Rest in peace Chadwick
This Movie Shows Marvel Has A Good Soul😇
"I am Queen of the most powerful nation in the world! And my entire family is gone! Have I not given everything!?"
This is Chadwick’s Song now and forever 🕊💜🖤
Does anyone know who did the mix for the trailer? I want that version so bad
They Released This Song LONG Before The Movie Comes, That Rare
Wakanda Forever 💯💯💯🔥🔥🔥
Please upload also the remix with Alright.
Where is the Kendrick Lamar song??
Imagine that Chadwick Boseman was still alive hiding in the marvel headquarters pranking the whole world about his death. Then comes out to fight namor in wakanda forever and says it was just a prank. Oh how wonderful it would be.
https://youtube.com/shorts/5D_DWiVOp4A?feature=share Please like and support.....
Ahh man 💔😫
nobody talking about how the title is prologue, meaning this shit plays in the beginning of the movie.
que en paz descanse su Majestad Rey de Wakanda T'challa Chadwick Boseman 😭💔🙏wakanda Forever
Real smooth this movie is kicking black men to the curb....
Beautiful 🌻 I’m in awe✨Tems you did excellent! RIP CHADWICK BOSEMAN & BOB MARLEY 🤍🤍
This cover reminds me of my mother who tragically died in 2020, even though I didn't get to say goodbye I hear her voice when the song says Everything gonna be alright.
This is why Bob Marley is a legend !!! 🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲
finally released！！！！！
Black Panther Soundtrack is always a masterpiece.. Already hocked and anticipating an epic one
I love tems but this song would have been much better Koffee of Ayra.
LET'S NOT CELEBRATE BLACK DEATH, and let's also not celebrate the killing the first and most ICONIC character of African descent in comics. Nor should Marvel Studios make money off of Chadwick Boseman's death by exploiting it. (RIP) Chadwick Boseman  Recast Tchalla https://youtu.be/cT6hbRYBEI4  https://youtu.be/fNxhlC9r2Yg
Can't really explain what I feel while listening to this song because the emotions are just so intense. Love this song. It sounds great. Wonderful.
Its hard to see black panther without Chadwick Boseman  But memories always stay❤️🥺
RIP BLACK PANTHER
🙌🏽 🙏🏽❤️
You know this trailer blew up when Marvel release the background music as an official part of the soundtrack
#WakandaForever #WakandaWSercu
Gonna Cry?
WAKANDA POR SIEMPRE

#WakandaForever #ChadwickForever

Epic
That was absolutely beautiful
Not gonna lie I got a little emotional watching the trailer. Because now I guess it’s finally sinking in for all of us that Chadwick is really gone.
this is up there with running up the hill kate bushh who
Beautiful.
This song hits deep like the trailer. Chadwick is probably crying above to witness a masterpiece.
Wakanda Forever King Boseman 🙏🙏🙏
Lyrics anyone?
this time for "THE CHADWICK BOSEMAN"
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Oh my gosh I was not expecting an extended😭😭
Beautiful!
Wakanda Forever Love you Chadwick Boseman
We miss you T’ challa... Wakanda will never be the same... 🥺
The production value of Forever is ridiculously top notch that makes other MCU’s movies look stupid and kinda fucked up the balance of MCU’s movies consistency in production value lol
Está canción meda escalofríos recordado a chawin boseman desde cielo
Naruto: No Boy No Cry
WAKANDA FOREVER
🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬👍
Dry Your Tears I Say!!!!!!
RIP king 😭 wakanda forever
Mcu had a good choice in music❤
Does Tems know she's gonna win an oscar?!?! She really came a long way, very happy for herrr
Was waiting
Can't wait for this movie.   Wakanda Forever. ❤️
I love the way Marvel always changes the melody and rhythm of the song to fit the trailer
This movie is going to be awesome
Tegal hadir
💖 infinity times 🥰😌
I love this cover!  🤎✊🏽
How ppl here cause of black panther 2 trailer 😳
This song has such a special meaning to me. When my mother was sick and in the hospital, the last thing she said to me before she died was, “Everything will be alright.”
This is going to be emotional.
This song cover and the trailer is just undesirable 😯😭😭😭RIP CHADWICK BOSMAN🙏🙏
Cancer sucks many people's beautiful life
Wakanda Lives Forever, Chadwick B Lives on. Tems sings we Listen. B Marley is nodding from Zion
I literally downloaded the three songs they have released for the Black Panther Wakanda forever brilliant simply brilliant I already have the other soundtrack for Black Panther soundtrack can’t wait till the movie comes out
Se o filme seguir com essa vibe é oscar certamente e vai marcar como um dos melhores filmes.
I hope they will later upload the Bob Marley’s "no woman no cry" and  Kendrick Lamar’s “Alright” remix. Its pure fire. Makes me excited for the overall soundtrack of the movie!
Beautiful
This cover is a mood and it's sooo good.
Tems🇳🇬 is just amazing 😊
I thought I heard this same song that goes " no man no cry "
Never lie this songs title Is really Woke they really should have changed to something else
❤️❤️❤️❤️
I can listen to it all day long !
Everything is gonna be alright 😇
No death no cry,,,no woman no new generation,,,see you again Chadwick RIP 🙏🙏🙏
Low key was kinda hoping that Kendrick Lamar was going to be in this 😔
About damn time
I cry 😭
BP movies have the best soundtracks of the MCU. I still remember how powerful the soundtrack for the 1st one was!

True Marvel fans already crying
I just CAN'T stop listening to it made me cry so hard is like a hand on my shoulder telling me that everything would be fine eventually
요새 마블영화들은 트레일러에 삽입하는 노래만 좋고 본편은 실속없는 경우가 허다한데... 뭐 이것도 그럴 것 같다.
You Are Missing In This World But You Are In Our Hearts Chedrick!  Wakanda Forever😢😢
T'Challa A.K.A Chadwick Boseman FOREVER🔥🔥🔥
Great vocal slow and patient on this track TEMS did great
I think it really put into perspective that he's gone when we saw that trailer. His absence was extremely present. Not in a Downey Jr way, but in a legitimately painful way.
Tems to the whole universe
WAKANDA-FUCKANDA-SUCKANDA
❤️
I need that version in the trailer with Lamar,
Amazing melodies 🔥🔥🔥❤️
Black Panther is one of my favourite movies. I am looking forward to seeing Black Panther: Wakanda Forever it will be so cool to see Letitia Wright in the suit and do all the cool action scenes. Chadwick Boseman is a legend and will always be Black Panther 4ever. 🤠🐾🐨
This song hits really hard......Dr Chadwick Boseman why😭😭😭😭Rest in peace King.Wakanda Forever!!
It's missing those drums beat
Chadwick Forever
The remix they put together for the trailer was better...I would like to hear that version, to keep it 💯
Bob Marley 💗  Chadwick 💗
Now I want the mash up version with  alright!
Love this❤️Tems 🇳🇬was definitely the right person to cover Bob Marley 🇯🇲. I’ve already listened 100 times and counting. Anyone else ready for Nov 11th to hurry up and come?
For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
bob marley the legend never die
Ok, she's singing no woman no cry ... And yup ... I'm a woman and yep, crying! Now if you add Angela Bassetts voice  talking about her personal sacrifices. I can feel pain at losing your family. She's got power in her voice. Tems, I came to find you bcuz I'm just LOVING your version. This is the PERFECT version for this movie. RIP Mr. Boseman.
RIP Chadwick
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
🙏 miss u panther
No, Woman, No Cry. That's all the words we all needed to hear from Tems to cry in the most emotional trailer I've ever seen.
I prefer the version with the echo…🥲
Im so dumb, i thought this was a trailer 😭
A good remake of The Middle from Jimmy Eat World
" In my culture death is not the end.it's more of a stepping off point. you can reach out with both hands and bast and sekhmet,they lead you into a green veld where you can run forever" -King T'challa
How can I listen to the one that has kendricks alright.
I need the mash/remix of alright as a official song for the soundtrack
My drug
Such a beautiful voice! And this song is just so amazing😭❤️
Black lives matter. Oh wait.
This song trending in Wakanda and Tlalocan(Atlantis)
Can we have the trailer track pls 😭😭🙏 i love that beatful-orchest one
Reading through the comments here  and I'm in awe the amount of praise Tems is getting is blowing me away her talent is being recognized international worldwide and im beyond happy for her
Tems is perfect for this song!
No one knows if Chadwick was alive, what MCU we would've get. Just a death changed the whole storyline. Brow!
Wakanda forever, indonesian metalcore forever https://youtu.be/h_lXTYShuzQ
Love me some Tems
Tems is moving mad with success 🙌
KING Tchalla Forever ❤
If you want chills.. go to 2:22
I can't handle this
Lyrics: No, women no cry No, women no cry  I remember when we use to sit, In the government yard in Trenchtown. Oba observing the 'ypocrites, Mingle with the good people we meet  Good friends we are, and good friends we've lost, along the way. in this great future, you can't forget your past. So dry your tears, I seh.  No, women no cry No, women no cry 'Ere, little darlin', don't shed no tears No, woman no cry  And I remember when we use to sit, In the government yard in Trenchtown. And then Georgie would make the fire lights, I seh A log wood burnin' through the night  Then we would cook cornmeal porridge, Of which I'll share with you. My feet is my only carriage, No, I've got to push on through.  So while im gone. Everythings gonna be alright  (x8)  So woman, no cry Cry, Cry no women, no women no cry, no.  No, women no cry (no cry) No, women no cry.  Hmmmm, Ohh, ohh.
Does T'Challa is going to come back? Does he??
from this song we know who's gonna be black panther...lol
WAKANDA FOREVER
I need this injected into my bloodstream
We need a trailer version song
I lost someone who was my soulmate a month ago and this song opened something I thought was healing. So sad and beautiful at the same time. RIP Chadwick
I prefer the version on the trailer (acapella + big beat and rap at the end)
we love u tems <3333
Long live the king 👑🤍
When we were born parents cried, When we live we cry, And when we leave the one who loved us will cry 😭. Life is all about cry.
Tems
RIP Chadwick Boseman... We still miss you man. You fight for to achieve your dream to become an actor. You showed us that anyone can achieve a dream goal I hope I'll one day achieve my dream goal to become an author. Again, RIP Chadwick Boseman... Wakanda Forever!

#RecastTChalla
I like the tribute to Chadwick in this movie
I love you forover chadwick
Omg ! This movie is going to be 2022’s massive hit. Love the song.. I literally cried listening to it…and Chadwick Boseman … you will always be in our heart.
Just rewatching this to support our baby girl Tems ❤️🇳🇬🇳🇬
🥹🥲
Why I thought koffee that was singing this thou
Gonna be alright 💖😭☺️💓
No Chadwick I Cry.  We always remember you.
Beautiful
T'Challa should not be dead.
And just like, I'm crying. This is so beautiful and heartbreaking at the same time. 😭❤️ RIP Chadwick Boseman. 🙏🏻
It would take me a paragraph or more to share how this song resinates with my soul.   Simply LOVE IT!!!
For those who never heard and for those who wanna share it  HERE IS THE MILLION-DOLLAR QUESTION: Will you go to Heaven when you die? Here’s a quick test: Have you ever lied, stolen, or used God’s name in vain? Jesus said, “Whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.” If you have done these things, God sees you as a lying, thieving, blasphemous, adulterer at heart, and the Bible warns that one day God will punish you in a terrible place called Hell. But God is not willing that any should perish. Sinners broke God’s Law and Jesus paid their fine. This means that God can legally dismiss their case: “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.” Then Jesus rose from the dead, defeating death. Today, repent and trust Jesus, and God will give you eternal life as a free gift. Then read the Bible daily and obey it. God will never fail you.
mann i thought kendrick was about to drop a verse
WAKANDA FOREVER!  R.I.P CHADWICK BOSEMAN. WE MISS YOU💜🖤💜
Marvel, since you've post this in your official YouTube Channel, you better put this song at one point in the film.
They should have called burna too ❤❤but still it's nice👌🏾
Long live Chadwick Boseman and Long Live Reggae legend Bob Marley.
I have over dosed on  listening to Bob Marley    version🎶🤛🏾🎶
Tems no one but Tems👏🏿👏🏿🌹🎶🎶
TIMs NO ONE BUT TIMs could sing this.
Long live the KING 🙅🏾
I’m really gonna cry bro
Where’s Kendrick
Nothing can Replace T'challa but , Don't worry , Everything Is Gonna Be All right . Everything is gonna be okay , everything is gonna Be better  Wakanda Forever ♾️ 🙅‍♂️🙅‍♀️🙅
Wakanda Forever
"I am the Queen of most powerful nation in the world and my entire family is gone, Have I Not given everything " This line 😭
Would have loved to hear Lauryn Hill on this!!
This movie will suck
Teeeeemmmmmssssss❤️ Rest in Power Chadwick Boseman RIP King T’Challa Wakanda Forever
Goosebumps is just an understatement !
I love this song and I can’t wait to see Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, but what am I supposed to do until then?
This hurts so deep, I can’t explain. RIP Chadwick 😭❤️
Guy, Tems Done Blow😤😤😤
What a heart-tugging rendition of a classic! Tems is a national treasure 🇳🇬.
Anyone who doesn't appreciate poetry doesn't understand that it's all about seduction
Just so that everyone understands correctly it's "No, woman, no cry"
❤️❤️❤️🇧🇷❤️❤️❤️
Yeah, we don't have to 😭, because tomorrow we surely be good o
Chadwick Boseman died from cancer. And now listening to this song I think of my mother who died from cancer too. "And when I'm gone everything's gonna be alright".  My mother would say something like that. And would say to me to be patient. I know. I know.
This movie gonna be corny, I can feel it. No Boseman no black panther.
If y’all ain’t catch chills watchin the trailer to this film, y’all must not been born with goosebumps cause mannnnnnnnnnn, I can’t wait for this film!!!!
Give this lady a video
Like to Bob Marley.
Belíssima 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
I'm scream crying in my Angela Bassett voice. Who else?
Thank you Marvel
🖤 my gosh I can’t stop listening to this .
Tems delivered this is so soothing to the soul🥺🇳🇬
Quero a versão do trailer
The Next "See You Again"
Its so sad both the legend associated with this song is no more RIP💐 Chadwick Boseman and Bob Marley ❤️
THE KING LIVES
إِنَّا لِلّهِ وَإِنَّـا إِلَيْهِ رَاجِعونَ  Wakanda Forever
I'm not sure if I ever heard the perfect song before..........until now. #yibambe #wemissyouchadwick
I love Tems 🇳🇬❤️
Tems sempre doce.👌🏾
Tems sounds beautifully 🤌
Pelo trailer a trila sonora tem tudo haver com o filme 😍
The Like button does not suffice what I feel for this song.
Am I the only one that feels a knot of emotions the second the song starts?? I don’t know how I’m going to get through the film
music is still good. hopefully the movie doesn't s**k a**. But im not gonna keep my hopes up.
When I heard “But while I’m gone, everything is gonna be alright” I personally felt like this is The Artists way of portraying of Chadwick speaking through music to his fans and piers. God may you rest in power Chadwick, it’s gonna be hard listening to this song and watching this film. To the one true king of Wakanda 🖤
Is this song's original legend Bob Marley's no woman no cry?
She kills it
Cringe
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️RlP
Where is Kendrick Lamar ... I love when he's say when I wake up
I great sound from a Nigerian sister. I feel the vibe.
The late Bobby marley would be proud of tems
We are all going to be crying when we see the movie #WakandaForever
No woman, no cry.. yes because I'm bawlin. What an absolute masterpiece!
I need that music from the trailer
For thechala🥰❤❤❤
The bigger picture for the making of this movie was for political reasons Biden is not doing to good so I think there trying to get us ready for a Killary Satan = Love and Thunder,  Michella O = Black Panther 2, Harris = Women King. I believe that Hollywood is payed off by the DEEP STATE to promote there crap
Really 🤗 :) Words............. No woman no cry
Who is love this song ? Like my comment 🥰🖤
I miss that man's energy, seven seas away, a man i have only seen on screens, have taught me a lot about life I get emotional whenever i watch first one, pure love for him
Tems é a minha cantora favorita do ano!!
It's just crazy Marvel haven't an official profile on Spotify...
This song is just wow 🤯😍🎶blew my mind away from the first note
It felt like the post credits scene will be this along with the pictures of Chadwick Boseman's legacy.
It's becoming emotion for me 🥺🥺❤️
It's becoming emotion for me 🥺🥺❤️
Essa música vai ser o tema! Para sempre Wakanda! 🙅‍♀️🙌
Joy And Tears... Tems! What A  Spiritual Rendition - It's A Resurrection Of Human Terrestrial Efforts. Marley & Chadwick - Your Works Are Eternalized In Our Hearts
My new addiction lets go
Please drop the full song
I never new the man personally of course,but Chadwick boseman's passing makes me so sad, a deep sadness that's stayed with me i don't know why...though while you are gone your majesty ''everything's gonna be alright''.
Tems 🔥❤️🙅‍♂️
song sucks
It's always the best that leaves fast... Rip man you'll live forever in the form of this franchise You'll be remembered everytime we see Black Panther. You'll always be our king. To our king T'Challa... Wakanda Forever 💜
No more boseman..  That's why we need to 😭😭😭😭
Ok, o Kevin Feige e o Coogler vão pagar minha terapia.
This definitely didn't need to be redone. Much worse than the original, the song also has nothing to do with black panther or any of its themes.  Complete misuse of a gem that never needed a cover. Sorry people keep doing terrible versions of your songs for a quick cash grab Bob Marley.  Jeez this is terrible man like really bad
What a beautiful version
So much emission
Boss
CHECK THIS MOVIE TRAILER OUT 👇https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=iwVJ91J6_EE
Ooohhhh shiiiiiit......Bob Marley 😭🇯🇲💚💛❤️
This song has opened the wound of losing Chadwick Boseman.  I still have not come to terms with losing him so soon.  This haunting classic is a mix of remembrance, loss and healing.  This trailer has been indelibly imprinted into my spirit.
Wakanda Forever! (I am not crying! 💔)
🥲
Can we get the mix with Kendrick?
Daniel Kaluuya being sneaky mentioning this song on Hot Ones before we knew what was up haha
🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬proudly tems🔥❤
Black panther 1 - opps  Black panther 2- no woman no cry  Both are ❤️
So beautiful 😍 go TEMS!!!
Bob Marley would be honored by this
Y’all we gone be alright whatever you going through we gone be alright 💯
2:22 best
Should we bow while listening ? Yes this is from the king T-challa's kingdom "Wakanda"  ☮️ 🙅🙅🙅🙅🧎🧎🧎
You made me cry again...
Favorite song at the moment ❤️❤️❤️
Beautiful song.
Está y la de santa fe clan quedan perfecto en la película
They need to drop the version from the trailer
Is Bob Marley credited for this song? Also it’s “No Woman, no cry”. As in “No woman,don’t cry “. As a Jamaican without the comma it changes the whole sentence lol. Now to me it’s sounds like “women don’t cry” or “no women cried” = In patois “no woman neva cry( no woman cried) or “woman nuh fi cry(women don’t cry )”.  It’s suppose to be conciliatory.   But that’s just me thinking into it. It’s still similar.
RIP Chadwick Boseman this shit got me crying 😥
Best marvel theme
Am crying atm 😭😭😭
honestly tem's this is not jammin
So many energy in this song the more you listen more you understand how black phanter gave impact to world
This is fantastic and magical. A magnificent version that matches well.
Essa música, trouxe lembranças que eu nem sabia que existiam, Black panter tem as melhores trilhas sonoras. I love It!
Tems 😭😭😭😭😭 What have you done to me 💪💪🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬
tems never disappoints
🥺🥺🥺 in this great future you cnt forget your past
😥😥
I feel if executed properly this movie can end MCUs unstable hit and miss phase 4 on a very strong note. Trailer looks so good. Angela Bassetts dialogue delivery is top notch. I trust Ryan Coogler with this and I know Marvel won't mess this one up. Plus they have the added Chadwick Boseman real-reel death factor. I will be ready to weep in theatres in November
💜🖤Wakanda Forever🖤💜
Wakanda forever my brothers
💯Bob marly..Bob marly..Bob marly...Bob marly..🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲💯😇
Wakanda forever
Tems😍🥰🇳🇬🇳🇬
Maybe you won't cry
First time I saw this dude movie Civil war that was an epic movie I never forget and so as his own .
Chadwick would see this and remember  they did this for him
Temsssss baby
Top song top trailer! So hyped for this movie
Love tems. But they could've gotten a Jamaican singer to do it. Lila Iké, sevana, noami cowan...tons of talent. Good for tems tho
This hurts😖
당신을 기억합니다 마블민국  ... 와칸다 포레버 !
what a beautiful song, it skips the heart and goes straight to the soul
imma wear all black panther stuff in the cinema to honor chadwick 🙅🏻‍♂️
The only artist who could have done this!!
Man I Love our people
I have heard 1,000 versions of this, this is the most beautiful, it is getting me at a soul level.
Could be a flop🤔
Marvel Never Disappoint from its Soundtrack
Wow! This movie is about to have another banger soundtrack like the first one. Such an emotional song. What a perfect choice for the trailer 👏
In almost no time at all, this has become a favorite song of mine. Rest In Peace, Chadwick Boseman.
This movie is going to be the best tribute for Chadwick, he lives forever
Everything's gonna be alright.
dammn the chills
God is good
I can't wait 💕💕
I just love how Africans are rising.  Just give us the opportunity and see what we can do. Love love tems
Wow tem's Nigeria to the world
a perfect song for this fim and MC
🙅🙅‍♂🙅‍♀Wakanda Forever 🙅🙅‍♂🙅‍♀
2:25 best part
🐒🐒🐒🐒🐒🐒
I just cried when Tems sing this song when I watch Black  panther 2 trailer.  R.I.P my king Chadwick boseman.  In the legacy of Chadwick this song needs remix with kendrick .
When it comes out it will definitely be movie of the year.❤️❤️❤️
#WAKANDAFOREVER RIP CHAD WICK BOSEMAN ONCE WAKANDA ALWAYS WAKANDA FOREVER
Rip big brother this makes me think of the things we use to do back then.
Tems "No Woman, No Cry" cover for BLACK PANTHER soundtrack. I love her cover. Sounds like sadness & healing at the same time. What a spiritual dirge her voice turned it to 😭.. This is a Hymn
just wanted to share my last night's dream, I am near a shore , something exploded, like there's little volcanoes inside the oceans, people in my dreams says it's a leviathan, or it's far more worst. I'm with a lot of questions, the air was busy, jet going out to where the explosion was happening and I saw a helicopter right above my face rushing until it fade away behind me. Then , a figure God-like ( about 7 to 8 foot tall, very huge man, can't see the face though )  standing before me said " don't worry about it " ( which in fact I'm so worried about because I'd die in a tragic way, which I never ever wanted, I want to die in my sleep, peacefully, with sweetest dreams ) and idk why I hugged that Godly figure but while hugging Him, talking to me in calm sweet voice like in movies about the Godly figure, idk what He told me, it was a long conversation, it's like I want to go to the light with Him but then He said I need to go back to the land of the living and I woke up disappointed as I haven't walked with Him. And now back to the real world, the cruel world where everything hurts me got me wondering again what's for tomorrow? This song somewhat made me believe that someday somehow, everything would be alright, no matter what, no matter when's gonna be ? I wish I'd find more ways to appreciate life more while my body's still in this into the unknown earth 612... I'm missing the old selves of me, especially the teen and adolescents versions of me which I badly need now, like rn.
Do you think the avengers will be at the funeral in wakanda? just curious
Africans have this thing in their voice that I can’t explain it’s so heavenly beautiful made me cry
Tems really brought it!!!!
The perfect song for remember him and watch to the future 😭❤
[Intro: Tems] No, Woman, No cry No, Woman, No cry  [Verse 1: Tems] I remember when we used to sit In the government yard in trenchtown Oba, Observing the hypocrites Mingle with the good people we meet Good friends we have And good friends we've lost Along the way In this great future You can't forget your past So dry your tears i say  [Chorus: Tems] No woman, No cry No woman, No cry 'ere, Little darling Don't shed no tears No, Woman, No cry [Verse 2: Tems] Said i remember when we used to sit In the government yard in trenchtown And then georgie would make the fire light As it was A log wood burning through the night Then we would cook corn meal porridge Of which i'll share with you My feet is my only carriage No, I've got to push on through But while i'm gone  [Bridge: Tems] Everything's gonna be alright Everything's gonna be alright Everything's gonna be alright now Everything's gonna be alright Everything's gonna be alright Everything's gonna be alright Everything's gonna be alright now Everything's gonna be alright So woman, No cry, Cry, Cry No, Woman, No (Woman, No) So woman, No cry, No cry No, Woman, No cry [Outro: Tems] Hmm!

#yibambe #restinpowerking #recasttchalla #recastgeneralross #chadwickboseman
So use Bob Marley's song covered, and instead of just asking to use the actual song, and the fact that I don't know, uh, hmm, you're profiting and killing off a character that just got thrown into the MCU.
Tems is everywhere now. I love it!
Makes me so happy but so sad at the same time. Love Tems
Women phase
AN EMOTION!
oooh gosh this is eargasm 😍🥰 wakanda forever ❤
Never forget the OG Bob Marley ❤️‍🔥
Way to butcher a classic song.  Terrible cover version.
Till my heart ♥ wounds won't repair, i will listen this songs.. "Everything gonna be alright".
I’m glad this is going to be in the movie and not just the trailer.
I came to remember after the trailer for Black Panther: Wakanda Forever! What a perfection 💖

Tems and Marvel………..crazy🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
App se mera kuch help ho sakta he my challen ,'beatyfull nature' start naw
No woman no cry.
Listening to this after a long shift, my joints throbbing, trying to remind myself I'm doing this to finance my dreams...feeling so much and this song is just everything. My dad passed this vinyl onto me, it's one of the only things I have of him, and I feel like this just took the comfort of this song to the next level.
Wakanda forever. Rest in power Chadwick. Everything’s gonna be alright 🙏🏼
This song is a tribute to chad 💯 of the way, he was a humble person who did the most for all he met, though I never got to see him in person I could tell he was a gentle soul and loved 🥰 all with grace an poise he will be forever Idolized as the king 👑 of wakanda 🐆   I know this will do 🫡 well so   Wakanda forever
I’m going to a hot in the theater.  I’m ready to cry right now
This is super amazing her voice on the trailer gave me chills 🥺❤️Tems am sending you love from Ghana🇬🇭❤️🔐
Que música incrível! 🥺
Hearing this at the start of the trailer and as it continues on just brought me to tears. Thank you, Tems, for creating such an amazing, heartfelt cover.
When you can't tell if you are crying cause this song is so emotional, because you miss Chadwick Bozeman or you miss T'challa but all you know is this song is messing up yours emotions
2:23
Comecei a chorar nos primeiros 10seg de trailer! Essa música encaixou perfeitamente
Noooo gomas no hay, no gomas no hay
This song really makes me crying right now  So much dedication for the man who is not with us anymore 😭
This movie is going to make everyone hysterical in the theaters.
Bob Marley would be proud🇯🇲!!
Titles: no woman no cry Me : man did
This version is amazing, heartfelt, & moving ✨✨✨
Although tragic his sudden death did Marvel a favor, they would definitely replace him with a female version later on anyways, and now they can use this tragedy to increase marketing as well and make a tons of money from it.
It would be better if bob marley original song was used
This song better win a Grammy. #WakandaForever
This shit just hits TOO DAMN DEEP! 😭 Wakanda Forever! ❤️
No one going to say anything about the gender bending... systematic replacement of male characters with females? Your boy fu@king dies and they replace him with a woman.... fu@k #Disney and FU@K THE MCU.
A versão do trailer tava melhor, poderiam ter mantido alguns estrumentais
is this supposed to be a trailer for this cuz it's fucking lame and that's sad because the original movie was fucking badass?
Long live the King 👑 🐆
"I am King T'challa".. Wakanda Forever..❤️
Good friends we're and good friends we've lost along the way🥺🥺... can't stop listening to this
This movie is going to have me in full water works 😢
And the oscars goes to
TEMS❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😭
desde que vi el tráiler llore cuando salió una pared pintada el retrato de Chadwick Boseman, wakanda por siempre y para siempre te vamos a extrañar esta película no va ser igual sin el
Chadwick Boseman's death made everybody cry, woman and man.
This will be the marvel fanfare as the logo appears
Rest easy Chadwick boseman. Gone but never forgotten. You were an inspiration to me💯🙏🏽
They have to get this movie right!!!! Was let down with multiverse of madness and love & thunder, but this has so much potential to be great!!! Hopefully they get it right for Chadwick!!! RIP❤️
Everything' gonna be alright
Are there other similar songs to this?
Rest In Peace Chadwick
One word:  ✨B E A U T I F U L✨
*Trailer reminds me Aquaman's trailer...*
*Everything I Need is better.*
imma listen to this my whole life
Well I just learned how to loop a YouTube video on mobile 😂✊🏾
Wow, just wow
I remember the last trailer for a movie I watched over and over was Avengers: Infinity War. Now Wakanda Forever just took that post what a beautiful song what a beautiful trailer. I can't wait for the movie.
Nigeria to the world 🇳🇬

Damn they really put this song onto this movie and i don't mind if they put it in the ending to pay tribute to chad. To then show he's legendary moments and then leave it with a passion on legend to this new actor who will make it justice.
The way she sings it! Lord Have Mercy...... you feel the emotions, pain, strength and power
Beautiful
👌🏻👌🏻👏🏻👏🏻
This movie will break my heart and mend it in two minutes.
No woman no baby
Perfeição.
Who are coming after watching black panther teaser ❤️ BT background music best hai🥰 🎶
FUCK I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS SONG!!!!!
Sobbing.
Se a música já era boa, nessa versão ficou ainda melhor 🥺♥️
✊🏽✊🏽✊🏽✊🏽✊🏽
😭 I just LOVE this soooo much. This is the first time I’ve heard a rendition that I’ve fallen in LOVE with.
nice
This song hits different so beautiful
I knew it !!!!!
Tems.. 🔥 🔥
Goosebumps 🤧
People loved it so much, they knew they had to..
(hits play and repeat)... Welp.... Good night everyone. Do NOT wake me up until 11.11.22. (pulls cover up to ears)
There is a haunting quality to this version.
Probably Marvel’s equivalent of See You Again from Furious 7  Oh, Chadwick, we will miss you forever😢😢
Tems is getting bigger and bigger and I am here for every moment of it.
I can picture this playing at the end credits of the movie, while showcasing scenes of Chadwick as BP and some behind the scenes videos. Maybe some childhood videos of him as a kid😢😢😢
A gorgeous rendition ❤🙌🏾💯
WAKANDA FOREVER I LOVE YOU CHADWICK BOSEMAN
This emotional damage is too high 😭
I cant listen to this without crying. RIP Chadwick Boseman
The transition between Marley’s lyrics “everything is gonna be alright” to Kendrick Lamar’s “Alright” = flawless. Kudos to the sound mixing team!
You can feel the song if you lost something....
Happy for Tems. She deserves this
oh Chadwick, I never cry for a celeb or person.  you and ms. Franklin are the only ones.
Everything's gonna be alright!!
When I was kid, my favorite movie was superman. I had a homemade costume and I'd wear it every day. Christopher Reeve was my hero and it broke my heart when he had his accident and again when he passed.  When Black Panther came out, it made me so happy to see young people find their hero the same way I did. And my heart broke my heart again to see them lose their hero as well.  Chadwick Bozeman was every bit the quality human being that Christopher Reeve was. He is sadly missed.
as a Jamaican hearing this makes me happy bob was really a legend and this cover proves how good the song is
Tems is killing the game 🙏🏾✊🏾
Tems you did this. Epic. Bob Marley would be proud of you. Well done sister.
FOREVER 🙏
This movie bouta hurt🤕, but WAKANDA FOREVER 🙏🏿❤️
man that is garbage fire, way to ruin a teaser
Chadwick. We miss u🥺💚🙅‍♂️
i'm so sad😭
Why did they not include the Kendrick part of the all rights that made it sound even deeper having Kendrick and her line up
One of the best things that heppned in the mcu ngl.
😥
WAKANDA FOREVER  | x |
If this isn’t the true definition of beauty.. What is?❤️❤️
No woman, no cry, BUT AS A MAN IM LEAVING THE THEATER TEARY EYED GOD WILLING
Got me in all the feels 🥰💗💫
🫡 Rest In Peace Chadwick. You will always be remembered. 😭
Goosebumps…why am I crying?!
we need the trailer version as well please
Forever
This cover is amazing
This song is so powerful, Bob Marley or Tems, just feels so powerful
This is the first movie I'll be watching in theaters. I'm ready!!!!!!!!! Let's go!!!¡!!
Wakanda Forever 🖤🖤🖤
Everything's gonna be all right's
So many words come but can’t be said. Thankyou for all you have Thankyou for what will come 🌸🙏🏽
Just love this song ❤️
Elle a dead ça 🔥🔥🔥
The fountain is making waves now? Now we are all seeing the essence of that feature. We have to give it to Big Wiz for introducing this talent to the world♥️
I know i WILL cry during this film Chadwick in my eyes was a big inspiration to me and also inspired me to get into acting the day i heard of his passing i refused to leave my house i mourned for about a week and a half Chadwick will forever live in my heart my prayers to his family and friends what an amazing man he was Thank you for all you’ve done Chadwick rest in power❤️🕊
No, woman, no cry No, woman, no cry   I remember when we used to sit In the government yard in Trenchtown Oba observing the 'ypocrites Mingle with the good people we meet Good friends we have, oh, good friends we've lost Along the way In this great future, you can't forget your past So dry your tears, I seh  No, woman, no cry No, woman, no cry 'Ere, little darlin', don't shed no tears No, woman, no cry  Said I remember when-a we used to sit In the government yard in Trenchtown And then Georgie would make the fire lights, I seh A log wood burnin' through the night Then we would cook cornmeal porridge, I seh Of which I'll share with you My feet is my only carriage And so I've got to push on through But while I'm gone  Everything's gonna be all right Everything's gonna be all right Everything's gonna be all right, now Everything's gonna be all right Everything's gonna be all right Everything's gonna be all right Everything's gonna be all right, now Everything's gonna be all right  So no woman, no cry No woman, no cry No woman, no cry
❤️🙅🏿‍♂️
❤️❤️❤️❤️💔💔❤️
It's the feminine energy, the feminine strength, the feminine soul that pierces through and elevates this song to an anthem.
from trailer track was most epic
Man if I had the chance to add my vocals on the background, this song would be even more godly ♥️😩. It’s perfect either way though🖤💛😭
why am i crying
Chills and tears.
spotify when????
this is so perfect and still giving me goosebumps after many times of re-watch.
Goosebumps, the Great Bob Marley 🍁❤
Okay, this will be EPIC
Just here to drop my name on this masterpiece before the Movie is released.😉
Please release this on Spotify 🥹
He’s our king no one else but him it’s Shuri’s turn to be our queen of Wakanda my word of advice to her is don’t to it like him do it like her be her own hero she’s got this it’s her turn to honor Her Father and Her brother she can do it
Tems baby
I'm gonna need a jug of water for this movie to replace all the tears I shed
This rendition is beautiful
Amazing job ❤We're not ready for this
Tems the goat,the best voice I ever heard, ever ever ,the most unique voice ever,only Tracy Chapman and Lauryn Hill comes any closer, the only artist I know who sound way better live than on a record, now that's crazy
Wakanda forever 🔥😔💯
I'm not emotional. You're emotional.
Tems a star! Shine baby 🙌🏾
Que voz!!      ❤️
❤
#tems to the world. Nigeria on the map 🇳🇬😘🙌🏿 This song is winning an Oscar for best soundtrack, Grammy, and BET
Please make this availabe on Spotify :)
Wakanda forever
Rip Chadwick
Absolute garbage.
I'm literally feeling all kinds of way Rest in peace Mr. Chadwick Boseman!
Marvel, Thank you! The Wakanda Forever Trailer brought me to tears. This is one of my favorite Bob Marley songs. Tems sung this Bob Marley song so lovely. Well done.
I wish, I have time stone💔
Adoro esta versão, mas também adoro a versão épica do reboque. Marvel, poderia por favor carregar isso também? Tal como com o trecho do "Kendrick Lamar's Alright".
orginal version is wiz kalifa no weman no cry
Me encanta esta versión, pero también me encanta la versión épica del trailer. Marvel, ¿podrías por favor subir eso también? Como con el fragmento de Alright de Kendrick Lamar  y la otra música del fondo.
I love this version, but I also love the epic version of the trailer. Marvel, can you please upload that too? Like with the fragment of Alright by Kendrick Lamar.
Love this cover. They need to make a video of this as well. So powerful.
This is so beautiful omg.
🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲👌👌👌
No hate ohhh! Ghanaians will be hating 🤣🤣🤣... 9ja till infinity proud of our talents we too much!. Ride on Tems Grammy is knocking on ya door gyal..🔥🔥🔥🔥 Sound track for Black Panther Wakanda Forever✊🏽✊🏽✊🏽✊🏽.
Wow best remix ever
🖤 🖤 🖤
Almost two years after your departure...
This movie will bring so many emotions ,but I feel that bc we all love wakanda ,this fictional nation, but we admire it, yearn for it, and that’s what we all have in common together no matter who we are , where we’re from, this will bring us fans especially much closer. All tribes and Nations should show up for Wakanda & pay tribute to a great king & leader. Big respect. Now let’s get together 🫶🏼
❤️from🇮🇳
Everything gonna be alright... 🖤🐾💔
Thank you so much 🖤
This song has such a special meaning to me. When my mother was sick and in the hospital, the last thing she said to me before she died was, “Everything will be alright.”
where's the kendrick one
The movie theater will be filled with so many tears when this songs plays a tribute to the 🐐 Chadwick Boseman.  Rip King T Challa
Me pediste sobre y papel.🎶🎶🎶 Fotocopias del Carnet, net, net, net... Y pediste una regla y un compás. Y una goma de borrar.🎶🎶🎶 Y te digo: Noooo, gomas no hay! Nooooo, gomas no hay! Nooooo, gomas no hay! No! Gomas! No hay! 🎶🎶🎶
Preparando os lenços 🤧 A emoção no cinema vai ser grande ❤️
RIP Chadwick boseman 😭💔🥺
This whole situation by Disney and Marvel is a trash move! Hollywood continues trying to profit off of Black death and it's disgusting!
This woman crying. Look at all our shared feelings.  Our humanity felt with this song, decades old, covered by many,, and very effectively used here.   We are fans of the films, of music.   The outpouring of shared emotion is connecting us.  Be well, brothers and sisters of Earth.
Hold on a minute!!!! Where's kendrick Lamar part in this ???
This one hits on a different bone😑
🖤
Ohh finally they dropped it I was watching trailer all that time on repeat cause this song
Todos vamos a llorar por nuestro querido chadwick larga vida al rey siempre estará en nuestros corazones.
One song representing two kings👑.... RIP to bob Marley and Chadwick boseman♥
WAKANDA FOREVER! 💜
The producer behind the song 💌💌
#RecastTChalla
May Chadwick Rest in peace this movie will never be the same without him but his memories live one.....Tems has Angelic voice
Dope but where’s the mix from the trailer ? Lol
how much heart can you put in a song? 'All of it'
This is the song played at my best friends funeral after he took his life and was the song playing when he was found, Joe we are still healing from your sudden departure, you will always be a good friend and no woman no cry! 💔
I WANT TO CRY SO BAD
งดงาม....
Catch me at the theater this November in a Suit. Wakanda Forever
I was legit looking for that song
‘No Woman no Cry’  Me: too late
2:22
Sighh the amount of people that don't know this is a cover of a Bob Marley song. Don't get me wrong, this cover is INCREDIBLE, but the original is also amazing!
Yall went in on this one! This is going to break us!
Long live the king 👑 Chadwick Boseman
I know it 🔥🔥🔥
This girl Tems 🔥🔥🔥
The movie is going to be an epic masterpiece ,bigger and maybe better than the first film...  Hope Chadwick sees it all from beyond the sky. I know WE ALL GONNA CRY
What a nice rendition of Bob's timeless classic.
I've been so emotional since the trailer came out.🤧
One of my favorite songs...remembering the legend....Bob Marley
Shut up, I'm not crying, you're crying.
My feet is my only carriage So i need to push on through!!
Everyone's gonna miss Chadwick!
We miss you king 🤴🏾❤️🙅🏿‍♂️
Não, Mulher, Não Chore Não, mulher, não chore Não, mulher, não chore Não, mulher, não chore Não, mulher, não chore Disse, disse, disse que eu me lembro quando costumávamos sentar ali No pátio do governo em Trenchtown Oba-observando os hipócritas Enquanto eles socializavam com as boas pessoas que encontramos Bons amigos que tínhamos Oh, bons amigos que perdemos Ao longo do caminho Nesse futuro brilhante, você não pode se esquecer do seu passado Então seque as suas lágrimas, eu digo E não, mulher, não chore Não, mulher, não chore Queridinha, não derrame nenhuma lágrima Não, mulher, não chore Disse, disse, disse que me lembro quando costumávamos sentar ali No pátio do governo em Trenchtown E aí o Georgie acendia a fogueira Eu disse que era um tronco de madeira queimando na noite Aí nós cozinhávamos mingau de farinha de milho O qual eu compartilharei com você Os meus pés são o meu único transporte Então eu preciso continuar, mas enquanto eu estiver ausente Tudo vai dar certo Tudo vai dar certo Tudo vai dar certo Tudo vai dar certo (Eu disse) tudo vai dar certo Tudo vai dar certo Tudo vai dar certo, é Tudo vai dar certo Então, mulher, não chore Não, não, mulher, mulher, não chore Oh, minha irmãzinha, não derrame nenhuma lágrima Não, mulher, não chore Disse, disse, disse que me lembro quando costumávamos sentar ali No pátio do governo em Trenchtown E aí o Georgie acendia a fogueira Eu disse que era um tronco de madeira queimando na noite Aí nós cozinhávamos mingau de farinha de milho O qual eu compartilharei com você Os meus pés são o meu único transporte Então eu preciso continuar, mas enquanto eu estiver ausente Não, mulher, não chore Não, mulher, não chore Oh, minha queridinha, disse para não derramar nenhuma lágrima Não, mulher, não chore É Minha queridinha, não derrame nenhuma lágrima Não, mulher, não chore Irmãzinha, não derrame nenhuma lágrima Não, mulher, não chore.

Very heart touching very emotional this song is going enhance the film experience for sure. #wakandaForever #chad #ourking🖤
My prediction is this is gonna be the song when the Marvel studios title comes in
bob marley❤💚💛
R.I.P. Chadwic 🙏🙏🙏🙏
OMG temsbaby🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬.....I love you to the moon and back, gosh this is so emotional
Any one who says this isnt for boseman is lying 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Creo que el director de estás películas es mucho para Marvel, si se toma en serio a los personajes, no los vuelve una caricatura
Beautiful tribute. I can't get this song out of my head. OMG
Marvel has to release the official song because too many people were demanding it.
Tchalla ❤
Proudly Naija 🇳🇬  No woman, no cry but men's lives matter also...
Faxxx NO WOMEN=NO CRY
beautiful song
Wow. Speechless.
I love this song! her voice is gorgeous and strong.❣
"Good friend we have, and good friend we've  lost"  :')
This song is very touching and really fits to the movie as well especially Chadwick is no longer with us. Rest in Power, Chadwick Boseman A.k.a T'Challa. Wakanda Forever 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
I can see it now. This beautiful song is gonna play over the marvel intro then lead right into T'Challa's funeral.  Are we ready?
another Hollywood fairy tale about and for women 🤡🤡 .  See it for yourself
I love how its "no, woman no cry"
WAKANDA FOREVER RIP Chadwick boseman😢
Call me crazy but I feel like wakanda forever will be better than the first black panther
really miss you Our King... Wakanda Forever....
“I am Queen of the most powerful country in the world and my entire family is gone” should be part of the song, such powerful and emotional words
tems is the perfect person for this song
Got me all emotional, for me it goes two ways. For example when iron man died we felt the pain but we're relieved because we seen him flesh out enough movies for us and his ark was done but we knew he was still alive in real life BUT CHADWICK death is so painful we only got a taste of the AMAZING works he had in-store............ NOW WHEN I THINK ABOUT IT, THEY COULDN'T HAVE HIM RECASTED, WILL JUST BE WRONG
🖤🖤🖤
Come on, @MarvelMusicVEVO! Give us the trailer remix!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Please Marvel release the Kendrick's Remake too 😭
Spotify when
why cant free down
TEMS❤️ No term to express the beauty of your voice. ✨ Proud of our African queen
La canción da un golpe fuerte desde el minuto uno, Marvel se lucio al escoger esta canción. Que brilla para el la luz perpetua. 🖤👑
Big Tems 🔥🔥🔥🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬
"One good thing about music, when it hits you, you feel no pain."  — Bob Marley❤

In memory of chadwick
Lagu yang indah, sangat berkarisma dan penuh makna untuk sang Raja Wakanda, King T'Challa aka Chadwick Boseman. Hidup Raja untuk selama nya, Wakanda FOREVER !!!

This song is so beautiful. Looks like this is gonna be the song I play non stop for 1 week again 🙃
When are they going to add this to Spotify?
Wow, there are so many hypocrites here... In fact, no one cared about Chadwick Boseman while he was alive, but now you pretend that the actor meant something to you.  This pretense is the real shame.

Rest in peace Sir Chadwick Boseman Rest in peace Black Panther
Finally it's out
Cette chanson me donne des frissons 😭😭😭😭😭
" no woman no cry" 🔥🔥
Meh. I would have preferred the one from the actual trailer.
Zet het op Spotify. ☺️😉
Tems is just amazing... she's an incredible vocalist
Terms voice is Angelic wooooooow
It's one of my favorite covers ever
❤️❤️
we miss you so terribly Chadwick.
ฝ่าบาท คิดถึงนะ
literary i got goosebump ... Chadwick miss you 😭❣️..... #wakandaforever
And now let’s turn to the hymn “no woman, no cry”  by Bob Marley with our sister Tems singing it to us
We miss our dear king. This is such a wonderful tribute. Wakanda forever.
Fuck I cried listening to this
I knew it
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
For the love of God, Marvel please don't mess this movie up. Seriously, please 🙏🏻
The trailer was so Powerful! Boseman's gone but All I got glimpses of him in every scene 🥺♥️
https://youtu.be/97QAJ6eMwgo
Need this in Spotify asap!!!!😭😭😭😭
This track is so good, fit the theme of the trailer perfectly, giving a sense of hope, Black Panther Wakanda Forever will be incredible 👏👏👏👏
Finalyl~ A stand alone version. 😭 I really love how somber and serene this version is, the instrumentation is just right and the harmonizations were also did good... what a cover~!
Tems absolutely nailed the song
Tems absolutely nailed the song
This song gets me emo. Masterpiece!!
Paul walker: see you again   Chadwick boseman: no woman no cry
I cried 😭
My eyes are full of tears 💔🥲
This movie is definitely gonna make me cry.  R.I.P. Chadwick Boseman ❤️
CHADWICK BOSEMAN FOREVER
Tems well done !!! This is a nice song.
這電影很屌喔，靠音樂來打廣告。 票房應該輕鬆破15億吧
wait, prologue? 🤨
I really hope that Ludwig Gorranson is still composing Black Panther Wakanda Forever. He composed some of the best modern-day music even for the prequel of this movie
This movie is going make me cry in the theater so much
We miss you King
This shook me and made me realise I’m not over Chadwick’s passsing
♥
It was absolutely the most perfect song for this movie.... Chadwick we really miss you😭
I was searching this version of the song,,now it's finally uploaded..nice song👍👍
this is not a song its emotion
SHOOK!!! 😭😭🥲
rest in peace chadwick. this movie is going to be extremely inspiring to all 🤍🕊
Great ! ..
thank you!!
I really hope the movie has the tone of the trailer and isn't a comedic show.
Temsssss❤❤❤
Thank you Chadwick Boseman
R.I.P. To Bob Marley and Chadwick Boseman.
R.I.P Chadwick Bosemen 🕊️ "Our Black Panther"
This song is a Imotional tribute to Chadwick bosman 🥺🥺🥺
I love & hate this trailer so much because I'm actually hurting. I never thought it would be painful to watch any trailer and I see everyone's reaction with so much love. RIP King Chadwick Boseman
Chadwick 😭😭
Best trailer rip Chadwick Boseman sir 😩😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
This song make its separate fanbase after trailer 🙂🙂
Imagine the Wakanda Choir singing this song at T'Challa's funeral
Tems did such a good job with the cover omg 😭
This masterpiece is no longer a song  just like see you again.
the anthem of Wakanda! crushing version!
So amazing I know I am going to cry during this movie
💓💓💓🥹
This song is good but anyone else wanted the remix with Kendrick lemar's alright because that song was a remix for the trailer was a banger
I hear this as a plea from King T'Challa to Queen Ramonda, and it's just... just tears
RIP OUR KING. WAKANDA FOREVER
Youll never be forgotten Tchalla, WAKANDA FOREVER
Naija to the world
There will be a lot of people today who will say "That song isn't about what I thought it was" 🤣
Angela Bassett has a chance to be the first nominated actor for an Oscar in an MCU movie. Her few but powerful lines in the trailer alone emit an emotional performance that transcends just acting.
We all be crying like a baby when this song hit in theaters. RIP Chadwick and his legacy lives on.
Its Beatiful ❤😩💔
The soundtrack has to be 10 times better then the first one. And I really loved what kendrick lamar did.
I like this song.......
This November we will celebrate Life, life that happened and made us better and happier. Rest In Peace King T'challa, Long Live the memories of Chadwick Boseman. WAKANDA FOREVER!
i need that trailer version please upload that too
RIP Chadwick Bosman!!!!!! I hope he is ok in there with stan Lee!!!!
"No women no cry"....... couldn't agree more 🗿
RIP BOSMAN and Bob Marley
Tems music is therapy RIP CHADWICK BOSEMAN WAKANDA FOREVER 🖤🙅🏿‍♂️💜
🖤In our culture death is not the end🖤
If I hear this in the theaters when shuri defeats namor and gets the black panther role I will definitely burst out in tears for sure. Can’t wait for this movie regardless all the controversies surrounding it.
I've been needing this song recently, thank you for making and releasing it.
very soulful rendition of an all time classic. Tems is a Gem 💯🔥
Oksy people prepare your boxes of tissues before watching this movie  I can't stop crying watching the Black Panther promo.
We need another fire album for the movie
They should re-do this. The chorus at the end should be repeated throughout.
Everything's gonna be alright  ♥️♥️
Miss you king T'Challa 🖤🖤🖤
This is endless pain
Chadwick is going to be so proud...
Bob Marley HES i proud of his song....
I Know It's Very Hard To Believe, But We Have To Overcome This Grief, And Move On Slowly Toward Future. We Can't Forget It But We aslo Can't stay at grief.  #WakandaForever
😞🖤
Kereen asli 🇲🇨
Looks awesome and can't wait to watch it in theaters.  BLACK PANTHER WAKANDA FOREVER GUITAR https://youtu.be/sAiFeQuM2ks
It has been quite a while since we knew Chadwick's death  But this music had made us fans truly acknowledge his absence  If that makes sense 😔
❤️❤️
Just beautiful😍💓
Tems🖤🙁
This song itself makes me emotional 😢
This really connects us with our king T'challa....Forever king..... This let u feel grateful for everything.... "WAKANDA FOREVER" ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Shout out to Nigeria shout out to tems🔥🔥🔥🔥
Thank you For the upload of the original song 🎧 the vibe is on this year is on 🔥
The remix of the trailer is best
Very very wonderful song
This one hits different from Boney M no women no cry
Original was sung by the legend Bob Marley ❤️💚💛
I can't fathom how much I've cried to this😭💔 WAKANDA FOREVER🙅🏽‍♂️👑
Beautiful cover for a beautiful song. RIP Bob Marley and Chadwick Boseman. This movie looks amazing and Angela looks lie she's going to get a oscar nomination with that speech in the trailer. Hope to get John David Washington as T'Challa/Black Panther in the post credit scene faking his death for Wakanda's Safety. #RecastTChalla
We need All the stars back as Wakanda Forever theme song please marvel. AS a tribute to The Black Panther
Bob Marley's version is still the best!!
Where is the combination of English rap as in the trailer, want the full song like that, my next ringtone.
Man i miss Chadwick so much 😣 I'm sure everyone's gonna cry in the theatre's
Chadwick boseman  is always be our king.... And i am very proud to say WAKANDA FOREVER 😭😭😭
No Woman No cry has me BAWLING.  So much for the title.  This is breathtaking, heartbreaking, & beautiful.
He might not want us to cry but I can’t not cry 😭
Black Panther wakanda forever will be so good
This is beautiful 🔥🔥🔥
Beautiful voice...love this song so much... 👌👌💞💕🔥🔥
I come back to this remember this YouTube channel
🥺🥺🥺
I hope we get another black panther album like last time. So many bangers.
For anyone who didn't know this was a Bob Marley song. Tems killed it tho
This is the "See you again" of the 2020s. MIss you Chadwick .RIP King.
ฉันชอบมัน
I need the trailer version...more epic
It's an perfect and beautiful song...  I got excited in the part "everything gonna be all right " and makes me start to cry.... LONG LIFE TO THE WAKANDA'S REAL KING!  🙅🏿‍♂️

Can I use this background music
We miss you KING❤️
🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬🖤🙏🏿
Jesus. I don't know how we're gonna do it but we've all just have to push thru and bring tissues. This movie has the potential to be an absolutely beautiful tribute with action sprinkled around the edges. Such a wonderful cover.  Continue to rest peacefully, Chadwick...our King. ❤️🖤💚✊🏾🙏🏾💜
Yasss thank you I’ve been waiting for you guys to release this song 😢
We'll miss u Chedwick Boseman💕😢
Obrigado Marvel, isso ficou lindo ! 💖💖💖
its don't cry woman.
The movie soundtrack greatly enhances the movie and all of it. It made us feel like that movie
Oh my! The emotion of this song! I agree with those that have stated this will be the most emotional Marvel Movie to date! What a great Actor, and a great human being! Thank you Chadwick Boseman! This Movie will have all the feels!
Song is really Nice 🖤
"Good friends we have, oh  good friends we lost, along the way" I knew that line was coming during the trailer, but it still hit hard
i used to listen to this song all the time while growing up this just increased my love for marvel and this song.
Man! The trailer and this song was so emotional to watch.
This is Lovely song 💕💕💕
This song is made for Chadwick Boseman,  Ryan sir just nailed ittt. Loved it man , just loved it WAKANDA FOREVER ♾️
He said .. he doesn't believe in YOLO.. he said he will come back in an another life 💗💗💗
I hope everyone goes to see this film. It’s a tribute to Chadwick Boseman, it’s gonna be really special to his career and legacy.
You can’t tell me Tem’s voice isn’t anointed by the most high herself!
😭😭😭🕊️🕊️🕊️
This is such a beautiful rendition. Tems did her thing!
Marvel is a studio that cares for its fans, unlike DC and WB.
What a song
😭😭😭😭
The intro Marvel Studios crawl should be the one where all the images show Chadwick. With this song playing over. Would be so epic and emotional 🔥🔥🔥✊🏾
I still have my Daily Post that reads, “The King is Dead” I swear it felt like I was in a movie. This song is sad tone but to also up lifting, “everything’s gonna be all right, gonna be all right” RIP Chadwick “King T’Challa” Boseman thank you 🙏
"No Woman, No Cry"  when children were born to this world the very first thing they do are crying, and they came from a woman.  man I love this song's title
Todo parece indicar que Kendrick lo volvera hacer!!! #Arte
Beautiful
Qe need the trailer version please!!!!
didn't realize tems sang this 🥶🥶
Great song🔥
I'm not crying you're crying
This should be Chadwick's tribute song like "See You Again" was to Paul Walker.
"Everything's gonna be alright" Long Live the King.. Wakanda Forever❤❤
I can't wait for their rendition ft. Kendrick
Chadwick will always be are king and wonderful person at what he did,hopfully  Shuri gets the mantle.
Alright by Kendric is amazing too
Tems 🇳🇬  🇬🇭
Saludos desde Perú 🇵🇪
Chad :'(
WAKANDA FOREVER ✊🏾💜
RIP legend 🙏🏿
Wakanda forever 🙅🏻‍♂️

A beautiful rendition of this song  transform this trailer to be so emotional. Well done Ryan Coogler and team. Could'nt ask for more.
Chadwick 😢
The trailer made me cry. And she nailed this song… I’m so proud of Tems.
😢🖤

Whole Playlist is gonna be beyond amazing I just know it
Black Panther 2 is going to be so Beautiful can’t wait to watch it rest in peace Chadwick Boseman Wakanda forever
We all are giving on his death.RIP black panther
Yo sé que este tema va a estar en la escena del funeral de t-challa 😔😔
This is what magic sounds like🥹
This is good, but I prefer the way it was mixed in the trailer.
😍🎉
this movie definitely deserves a good plot. If it doesnt have one, than i will say Marvel has failed Chadwick
okay. now we want the epic version like the trailer did
i like how the name wakanda forever is shown more and visible than the black panther title. It shows the gone of the panther and comes with new people.
Estás rolas son las mías!
How bout i could b?
'Yes Man, Yes Cry' is how first day first show will go! 😭
masterpiece
Everything gonna be alright now ❤️❤️
Wakanda forever 🙅‍♂️

This is the Best.. R.I.P Legend Chadwick Boseman
Tems you are the best ❤️ Je t'aime Tems 😭💘
Been humming this song to myself for at least a day now.
plz this needs to be on spotify
Usually superheroes who die in comic stories never stay dead. This is not one of those stories…
podiam ter lançado junto com a parte do Kendrick ou logo um medley dessa com Alright
Wakanda Forever🖤
Thank you for releasing the full song @MarvelMusicVEVO.  I've been watching the trailer on loop for the visuals, but also to hear this song too.
THANK YOU!
"No, woman. Dont cry"   RIP King T'Challa! RIP King Chadwick!
That’s why I am single
This cover is good however I want the mix from trailer with the Kendrick Lamar’s ‘alright’
Lowkey made me teary eyed I really look forward to the movie the trailer is beautiful and gives me chills.
I’ve been waiting for thiss😭😭
Forever our king 🤴🏿
✊✊✊
im going to cry so hard
Rest in power king🙅♥️
I KNEW TEMS WOULD BE ON THE SOUNDTRACK, YASSSS QUEEN SHE'S PERFECT FOR IT!!!
I got very emotional watching the trailer for the first time because you can truly feel the lost of the legend and I still miss him. Even watching it a second time, I'm still crying. This is for you Chadwick. Wakanda Forever!
Amazing cover. Rip Chadwick. Sir you are missed.
I bet they’re gonna use this song for either the end credit scene or if there’s a funeral scene for T’Challa.  Rip Chadwick Boseman. Rest easy king👑
This movies gonna give me the chills
Tems is about to come up hard because of this. Good for her
This is absolutely fantastic
this song is "something" 😭😭
I'm here 4 it
Memories That's All We Have in This World Good an Bad  Shot-out to All The People's Children Stuck in Ukraine Fighting As Well Too and Shot-out to Chadwick and All Black people of Wakanda 🙏👑
Art really is a great way to cope with loss.   I hope the whole team can let it all out in this film.
the amount of emotions i am going to have when this movie comes out, im not ready
Easily the best trailer music ever
Yibambe, ....
This movie will be a woke disaster. Bring on the WAaaaamen. Phase 4 is a dumpster fire of garbage movies.
I try sis I try
we demand the serve  best universe ever
Tems is black magic 💯❤️🇳🇬🌍
Marvel must have seen how many people have searched for this version of the song after the trailer
I can see this more as the end credits song
🙏
It hurts not to cry
I was searching around for this version of the song online. Great cover!
Dam I know this movie gonna have me tearing up in the movie theater all 3 times I go to watch this when it comes out
It was just his time.  The good ones simply don't last... But what a time we had with him. Chadwick will be remembered in the hearts of his fans, family, and friends forever. Wakanda Forever.
WAKANDA🖤PORSIEMPRE.
Cant wait to see this movie. Wakanda forever.
This movie is going to hit way harder with lots of heart ❤️ This song will bring the best emotional moment like Furious 7 did with memories of: Paul Walker. This is for the king of Wakanda! WAKANDA FOREVER!!! 🙌🏿 For Chadwick 🙏🏿🕊
How do they find the perfect songs!?
https://youtu.be/4SZhoOACZ1w
this is gonna be epic
Omg my heart🖤😭
Marvel is wonderful
Thnx marvel for this song!! 😍😇
Please add back the drums from the trailer
This missing the essence of what u got from the Black Panther trailer... I think it's the Drums that need to be added.
This movie it would be an statement of unity, love, joy and sadness at the same. Wakanda is the place that everyone wants to live
I love this version. I remember my cousin. She has, literally, lost every member of her family. Her mother died while she was out of the country and she was unable to say goodbye at her funeral. Her father doesn't even recognize her and doesn't support her. Her only sister lives away with her own family. She is literally alone and, on few occasions, I've seen her cry and I've hugged her to comfort her.
This is as nostalgic as when when Paul Walker passed and birthed the "See You Again" record. Confirmed Classic!
Song is not available on Spotify yet :(
🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲
This Trailer Made Me So Emotional, I loved It, Man I Wish Chadwick Was Still Here. R.I.P Chadwick Boseman. WAKANDA FOREVER 💔🙏
Tems did an amazing job and I felt every bit of her energy. This is a nice tribute to our King Chadwick Boseman. Rest In Power
Trailer ver ?
it's very beautiful, but I wanted the version with Kendrick Lamar because of the pace that accelerates until the end
LuvU 3000 king👑 T'chala.
They're going to have us Ugly crying through this movie. Going to need to carry a box of 🧻.
💥💥💥
Thank you I’ve been waiting for this track
#Chadwick4ever#
Long life the King RIP Chadwick Boseman
Gracias por publicar esta canción. Tems ¡Bravo!
WAKANDA FOREVER!!! 💖💖💖 LONG LIVE IN OUR HEARTS KING T'CHALLA! 💖💖💖
😔😔✊🏻✊🏻
I'm already crying  😭😭😭
As a carribean person, I've grown up listening to this song. These songs always remind me of my dad. This is such a beautiful rendition of this song. It's breathed a new life into it. After hearing it in the trailer I was hoping to hear more in a full version of the song. I can't wait for the full soundtrack!
wow thanks Marvel thanks so mucho for your Great work. keep making movies with Heart
I'm mentally ready to watch this movie 😫😣
Uffff🔥🔥🔥
I’m gonna cry in the theater so hard  😭😭
At the end Wakanda Forever.
"No Woman No Cry" she didn't said anything about men crying so it's alright
This song gave me chills in the trailer! RIP Chadwick. Thank you for making millions of people happy. #WakandaForever
Thank you for this 😭
😭
Tems just DOES IT!!! She’s got such a powerful voice.
About time for Tems 💯
no DISLIKES. there is hope. 💚💛❤️
I love black panther. I can’t wait to see the movie
"d'ya hear me, d'ya feel me, d'ya hear me now"
Chill
We miss you, Chadwick.
Nice song bigs up tems
Me encanta esta música😭👌
QUE PERFEIÇAO DE SOM CARA
Temazooooooo!!🥺💖
Tems has been on an ascend since Wizkid's essence and I'm so happy that she's not stopping. Didn't recognize her voice in the trailer but can get her tone here. Of course, the legacy both Bob Marley and Chadwick leave behind is legion. Thank you Marvel 😭😭😭😭😭
I wanted the trailer version ;-;
🦋
Rest Well, Chadwick Boseman. Our one true king of Wakanda. Rest Well...
Santa Fe Klan will be part of the soundtrack too. Mexican power!!
Y aqui lloramos todos
This is a beautiful rendition of an already beautiful song
Love this song.
Can someone tell me the name of the artist
This is for Chadwick. This is for T'Challa. Wakanda Forever! 🖤🐈‍⬛🐾🙅🏿‍♂️
#RecastTChalla long live the king
I pray this is on the soundtrack! RIP King Chadwick, so deeply missed but never ever replaced or forgotten.
After all of trailers i watched from Marvel Studios, this one make me cry.  Close your eyes, listen to the song... and imagine with all these moments Chadwick Boseman did as the king, the Black Panther and at the end you say in the bottom of your heart : "Wakanda Forever"
ワカンダ・フォーエバー！！！
Everyone gonna be crying in the theater when the movie comes out. RIP King Chadwick Boseman 🙏😢😭
Quanto mais a música pede para não chorar, mais eu choro.
This song hits too hard 🥲
🥲
Beautiful cover. Can’t wait for the movie.
This is so beautiful.  ❤️ this the type of music I love.
This song brings me to tears. I’m gonna be a mess during this entire movie.
I want a blended version of No Women No Cry, Three Little Birds and Alright like we get in the trailer.
Wakanda Forever 👑
We miss you king Chadwick 🥺🙏🏼
Couldn't find this version on Spotify so now we where
Where's the Kendrick remix?
You know everyone is gonna cry we this plays during T'challa's funeral scene
Very emotional ❤
i just know for a fact i'll start crying when this song plays in the theatres
It hits different than bob marley version this version make me wanna cry
This movie bout to hurt all of us 😔😔
uffff
Release the remix please 😭😭😞
when will it be on Spotify?
WAKANDA FOREVER! ♥ Chadwick Boseman eternal.
hope they tell us in the film how Black Panther/ t challa died R.I.P chadwick u will be missed ):
If this song gets a dislike you don’t like good music . This is straight heat🔥
TEMS voice is magical! She is the next big thing!
never clicked on a video so fast!
"Prologue" I can already see everyone walking in white with Shuri holding the black panther mask while this song is playing in the background
Please upload the trailer version 🙏
Tems!!!!!! Doing justice to classic masterpiece and she did it 💯❤️❤️🇳🇬
One of the best covers I've ever heard of this beautiful song.
I am hoping everyone knows that this song was written and sung by Bob Marley and Vincent Ford
R.I.P Boby Marley  R.I.P Chadwick Bosemen
🔥🔥🔥
Thank u for this!
This movie is gonna be the most emotional MCU movie.
Oh, there will be plenty of crying.
We need the version with Kendrick PLEASE
Ws that temssss ?
FINALYYYYYY!!!!
❤❤
Was expecting the We gon' be alright remix but
This song feels like it would have played in whole world after the snap
Chadwick carrying the franchise posthumously.   Hopefully the writers were able to create a beautiful story.
No llores mujer de anuel aa
Do people actually know this is a cover from Bob Marley
LINDA ABSURDA
Rest in Power Chadwick Boseman.
Perfeito ❤❤❤
I've got no words😭💔that is so beautiful...gonna always remember Chadwick. WAKANDA FOREVER✊🏽
Will there be a "theatrical" version of this song like the one we heard in the trailer? I prefer the instrumentation in that one because the percussions in that version makes the song more tribal, more grand and overall more suited to being a tribute for T'Challa.
Me recuerda a cuando murió Paúl Walker de rápidos y furiosos, la rola que pusieron para la película donde aparecería por última vez fue todo un buum y aquí con un actor y personaje tan querido pasara lo mismo, obviamente con su propio estilo, muy muy buena canción
Beautiful song. I can listen to this over and over again. It speaks to your heart and soul. Thanks Marvel.
This song has always been spiritual to me. It means even more now that they're using it for this movie! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Literal Goosebumps. Hopefully they give Chadwick Boseman the best tribute.
My whole family all the way to my 3 yr...shook..❤️❤️❤️👏🏾👏🏾🙏🏽🖤🤎💐
Tems is healing the world with this music 🧡
Gonna cry thru the whole movie and I don’t even care who sees it.
I can feel the pain from Tems voice 💔 rest in person king Chadwick Boseman 🫀
To my son when he ll grow up...the death of your uncle Chadwick's broken us all
5 million views by tonight 7/25/2022
Wakanda forever! <3
This song gives me sad memories, RIP Chadwick boseman 💜🖤
Again Nigerians, this guys are something else
I've been hoping Marvel would release this ahead of the movie. Now we got something to nom on until November. ♥ Thank you!!!
Simply beautiful 💜🖤
This masterpiece is no longer a song - it is a hymn...
🙌🏾 - thank you much for releasing these
Literally EVERY time I repeat this song my entire skin shows up how much feeling does this song convey.
.                 Woke-kanda                         Forever                        She hulk      Carnt wait for superKAREN LOL Ya goofy m8te from Australia..
fantastic 4 will all have to be wemon..coz thats the way it is now
when will we see[ super KAREN] since everything has to be in a dress now.
this feels like a really pretty Chadwick Boseman tribute
I trust Ryan Coogler.
This has the potential to be the most emotional MCU movie to date.
Phase 4 has had a pattern, light hearted movie to heavy hitter. Thor? Was light hearted and allowed some good moments for us to have. Black Panther? Is basically ending the phase with a blast as well make us cry.
I can imagine Huckleberry Pie and Blueberry Muffin (Berry In The Big City) dance to that song!
These a master piece tems delivery 😩🔥
I love @tems music 🎶❤️
Wakanda forever💜🖤💜
This women is going to cry 😢 cry 😭 cry when I see this movie.
For Chadwick ❤.
Thank you for this Marvel!!
Legends
Why does it hit harder than the original?
I cried after the watching the Wakanda Forever trailer... I feel the respect for & grief at losing  Chadwick will blow out the Box office
Rest in peace Chadwick boseman!
🖤the best of marvel is about to come 🖤
Black Panther: Its gonna be alright 😏 Chadwick dies: Its gonna be alright 😕 Wakanda Forever: Its gonna be alright 😔✊🏾
Le quedo perfecta para el trailer de Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, excelente canción llena de nostalgia y sentimiento que pone a llorar a cualquiera.
Amazing cover. Am I the only one that was lowkey hoping that it would have the Kendrick mix with it?
song's been living rent free in my head for days
Chadwick Boseman Forever. RIP
Amazing ❤️🖤❤️😭❤️
Love this
Where is Kendrick lamar
Still believe they should recast, but this movie will hit hard for a lot of people and will be the best if not top 3 marvel film of this phase.
For Name, Respect, Fame, Love - U have to die first.
Her Voice is Angelic
#WakandaForever!
I like how 'now' the World appreciates Tems😭😭🔥🔥🔥it's so amazing to watch her growth when you've been a Fan since day one🔥🔥
I prayed for this song to be out since the teaser 😍 Wakanda Foreva 🙅🏾‍♀❤
Such a good song and so nice that they released it.
Es tan celestial, sublimeee...perfecta😔😔😍😍
Nice
Perfect!
Oh God, thank you
Epic!! Iconic!!
Thank you so very much for posting this.
This is a beautiful song. Really hope for a Spotify release soon
Me: We're going to need something from Black Panther 2 to touch our souls to pay tribute to Mr. Chadwick Boseman.  Marvel Studios & Tems: Say no more....
I have seen the teaser for so many times, but it never failed to make me cry. I lost my mother just this 7th of July 2022 to cancer as well, and it still hurts like hell.  Rest in paradise to Chadwick. To my mom. And to all the people that we have lost because of illnesses. 🕊️
Primeira vez que choro em um trailer só por causa dessa música. Melhor versão sempre!
Think this may be the only time I’ve cried to a song
We need the song from the first Black Panther trailer that one hit too!
Bruh why this not on Spotify yet? 🤨
So who's in charge of the Oscar winning album this time around?
the actors delivered a masterpiece movie with their honesty in acting along side the makers that made this movie worth waiting for months and watch it several times Thank you 💜💜
❤️
I’m already tearing up man.. movies going to be epic.. I hope..
R.i.p king 😔
Yibambe!
Eu ainda não tenho uma música de autoria da TEMS q eu gostei muito. Mas essa versão dela de "No Woman No Cry" do Bob Marley & The Wailers, ficou pesadissíma e perfeita pro teaser trailer do filme e creio eu pra ser a trilha do funeral do Rei T'Challa no filme!!!
Bro I freaking love this song, I’ve had this song stuck in my head sence Saturday night, I’m pretty sure this is the reason why I cried when watching the trailer thank you for posting this!!!
🇳🇬 🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬 Tems putting Nigeria on the map
RIP The Great Late Chadwick Boseman. Your Spirit is felt through and through. God bless the life you lived and the legacy you created
Vai brasil!
Rest in power Chadwick Boseman.
You can feel the ancestors in her voice
Tems 🔥
Beautiful. But orchestrated trailer version with Kendrick’s vocals is EVERYTHING.
This song is so beautiful this movie is gonna hit really hard
But I cried
Groovy
The feels!!
Lloro
Tems all the way💨💨🚀
thanks
Tems deserves an Oscar for the emotion in her voice.
this is my all the stars 2.0 i’m obsessed already fr
This soundtrack is going to be so good.
if they end the movie on this note with this playing as the credits roll… imagine 😭 not a dry eye in the cinema i just know i’m gonna be bawling
for you who fought in silence 🥺🤲🏾rip "King"
been waiting to have the full version since the second the trailer dropped, now i can stream and loop in peace 😁 this is everything, the vibes are unmatched
I can see this in the opening credits 😢 But in any way I'm gonna break into tears for roughly 65% of the movie
This soundtrack of the movie is gonna break records
I've been waiting for this, let the tears flow
The fact that its titled "Black Panther: Wakanda Forever Prologue" makes me think that this till be used as a montage showcasing Chadwick / T'challa and everyone's grief period following his death, while also showcasing the birth of Namor and the events that led him to where he is, before eventually getting into the main storyline for the film.
It is true that good people leave early
Why nobody talking about the fact that bob marley died of cancer too
When she says "But while I'm gone, everything's gonna be all right's gonna be all right" that's exactly when I got goosebumps! Oh Chadwick why have you left us! Why did you have to go!
Thank you!
In Loving Memory Of Our King Chadwick Aaron Boseman (11/29/1976-8/28/2020), And Michael Kenneth Williams (11/22/1966-9/6/2021), Dedicated To Dorothy Steel (2/23/1926-10/15/2021).
Ive watched the trailer 5 times now and now Im gonna cry so hard in the theaters
I love this song already ❤️🥺 but this movie is going to be the best and sad at the same time ..
Tems delivering 🔥🔥🔥🇳🇬🇳🇬 representing Nigeria, this is just too awesome, thanks for keeping Chadwick in our memories ✊🏾🕊️
I think there gonna play this Song during the funeral🥺😭 Rip Chadwick
Feelings will hit hard with this movie, long live the king, this will be a great farewell for Chadwick Boseman.
I love Tems so much. RIP King Chadwick ❤️
A song about not crying making me cry.
No es igual al del trailer
FINNALY!
No sale la parte del rap
I haven’t been this hyped for a movie since Endgame.
I feel like this will be used for T'Challa's funeral scene and I am NOT prepared for how many tears I'll cry over it.
Tems don’t miss🥹💯
😭😭😭😭😭😭
Tems has such a smooth sweet voice omg
Los sentimientos pegarán fuerte con esta película, larga vida al rey, esta será una gran despedida para Chadwick Boseman.
Chadwick Boseman FOREVER !!!
Announce Kendricks doing a album
I can't wait perfect music sad and uplifting at the same time I love how. black panther depicts a strong and self-reliant culture in Wakanda  the west must learn to respect african and other cultures as equal partners in our human family. I love the comics as well as the movies. I can't wait. to watch this.
This movie is going to be so powerful.  WAKANDA FOREVER AND REST IN POWER, CHADWICK!

Creí que era ADELE, pero escucho que es otra cantante, quién será?
Common Tems W
I'm going to try my best not to cry too hard in the theater. 😤
The Bob Marley’s original version is one of my favorite songs. Tem does absolute justice and a beautiful job on this timeless song.
I can’t to begin imagine how hard it was for the cast and crew to film this movie without our king Chadwick Boseman 😢😔
Beautiful voice (Tems).  Beautiful song. Beautiful trailer/teaser. #RIP Chadwick
Does anyone know if the full trailer audio will be released?
REST IN PEACE THE KING CHADWICK BOSEMAN
This movie is going to be so emotional and it will be a perfect tribute to chadwick the king of wakanda

I know this is based on Bob Marley's version but the chorus also reminds me of Naughty By Nature's "Everything's gonna be alright".
Que bueno que subieron el tema completo. No puedo sacármelo de la cabeza desde que vi el trailer.
Que perfeição! Wakanda Forever 🖤✊🏿🇧🇷
❤️❤️❤️
Chadwick Boseman Siempre estarás en nuestros corazones 🖤, descansa en paz🙏
Where does it change to Kendrick
Thank you fo this!
Great. Now this beautiful song will forever make my tear ducts leak.
Ammmazzing Song 🙌🏽Wakanda Forever 🖤💜 💙❤️‍🔥👑 🤴🏾👸🏾🙌🏽🙏🏽✊🏾💪🏾🤟🏽 🌍 🙅🏾‍♀️🙅🏾‍♂️ #ripchadwickboseman #wakandaforever
QUE PERFEIÇÃO
Thank you for releasing so early!!
Profoundly emotive rendition. Bob Marley would be proud 🦁💜🦁
Marley      .
Tems voice is extraordinarily♥️🔥.  This song really makes you shed a tear 😪 when you think about all the good works Chadwick Boseman left. You’re in a better place legend✊🏿🌍
Go Tems, go higher. This is dope
Tems well deserves  it i like her voice ❤️🎉😌
Que buena versión! Escucharé esta canción diario hasta que se estrene la película 🖤
This movie bouta make sum money… finna watch this like 20x time
i loveeeeeeeeeeee
Everything’s gonna be alright
Everything’s gonna be alright
Omg I figured they wouldn’t release the official version until closer to November!!!  Thank you!!!! ♥️♥️♥️
This is a really beautiful rendition.
I feel that this movie probably would win an oscar
This song is gonna hit next to All the stats 🥺
Marvel understands its audience. They're also aware of viral marketing.
I’m not ready for this movie 😢 RIP to the King Chadwick
Perfect.
#WakandaForever 🖤
If this is labeled as “prologue” then this may be used before the marvel logo in a montage of Chadwick and how T’Challa passed on 😔
WAKANDA FOREVER!!!
Finally took the time to research the lyrics. Of course I had them wrong. Truly amazing song. I had a penpal in 1972 Kingston 11 Jamaica. He sent me cut outs from package labels. I don’t remember his name. He probably knew the place in the song. This is bringing me back to when I was a poor little kid just learning about the world. Feels like it hasn’t gotten much better since then. Maybe this film will help me feel a little better
The best one
Best trailer ever, rip boseman, we love you
"In times of crisis the wise build bridges, while the foolish build barriers."
If "See you Again" was already a beautiful tribute for an actor, wait till this hits in theaters.... we havent cried hard enough yet.... We miss you King...
Beautiful Tems just Beautiful
Im gonna have a breakdown in this movie... Im actually tearing up as I'm writing this down. No other Trailer ever has made me feel so emotional...  Chadwick Boseman will always be missed...  Gone, but never forgotten.  Wakanda Forever!
But we need it on spotify
This got me all emotional
I hate when stuff like this happens cause I remember how hard I cried when they did Paul walkers end off in Fast 7. So I just know I’m gonna turn into a baby when this movie comes out
adoro
OMG TEMS !!! Wakanda Forever!!
Not the same we hear in the trailer. Will you release THAT version?
Isnt the original from Bob Marley? She sounds nice btw
Obrigado Marvel 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
I want to cry, I miss Chadwick, he had much to give as T'challa
Tems Killed it. The depth of emotion in this Song is crazy. You can't help but feel emotional and teary eyed. That Chadwick Boseman Mural in the trailer when the song was playing didn't help matters...
Finally release the song
Ain’t ready for this film
This song made me cry immediately, it means so much for the story but also as an anthem for all of us mourning the great chadwick
Really hitting hard   Really missing Chadwick "the true king" 😭
I think this is messaging to all of us that even though Chadwick is gone, he legacy still lives on
Simply Beautiful!
FINALLY!
CONGRATS TEMS ON GETTING THE MARVEL SOUNDTRACK CHECK!!!!
Inghane karayippikkaamo 😭
Bob Marley ♥️🇯🇲
So Cool Music 🎶 ❤🎧
Wakanda forever!
😭😭😭
I literally can't stop the listen that song!
Where is the mashup with Kendrick? 😭
Je pense que quand je vais aller le voir au ciné je vais pleurer rip Chadwick Boseman tu nous manque tellement 😢😢😢😢😢
Well done Tems you did an excellent job of representing Bob Marley and the whole Jamaica 🇯🇲 salute
I hope they make a version with Kendrick Lamar that had in the trailer too🤞🏾
TEMILADE!!!!
No woman, no cry No woman, no cry I remember when we used to sit In a government yard in Trenchtown Ob-observing the hypocrites Mingle with the good people we meet Good friends we have and good friends we've lost Along the way In this great future, you can't forget your past So dry your tears, I say No woman, no cry No woman, no cry 'Ere, little darlin', don't shed no tear No woman, no cry Said, I remember when we used to sit In a government yard in Trenchtown And then Georgie would make the fire light, as it was Log wood burnin' through the night Then we would cook cornmeal porridge Of which, I share with you My feet is my only carriage Though I've got to push on through So while I'm gone Everything's gonna be alright Everything's gonna be alright Everything's gonna be alright, now Everything's gonna be alright Everything's gonna be alright Everything's gonna be alright Everything's gonna be alright, now Everything's gonna be alright So woman, no cry Cry, cry No woman (no woman, no cry), no No woman, no cry, no cry No woman, no cry
I just know that everybody in the theater including me is going to be either tearing up or full-on crying, no in between.
It is so Beautiful and tearful , i can't wait the movie come out
I will forever love this song ❤️
This is definitely going to be the memorial scene for T’Challa.
Now release the mashup
I have never been so emotional about a trailer, this movie is coming 1 day after my birthday. I CANNOT WAIT
Best match
I’m cryinggg y’all, this song is so beautiful 😭✨🥺
RIP 🪦 king 🤴 Chadwick boseman 🫡✊🏻✊🏻 wakanda forever 🫡
Simplemente hermosa ❤️
Perfect song for the trailer. Can't wait to see the movie
this song fits soo well
I'm thinking of drawing Chadwick.
Sooooo Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeepic!!!!!!
I’m assuming they’re going to use this song in the actual movie, and when that happens I’m probably gonna start tearing up in the theater.
I have read all the comments and no one is acknowledging Bob Marley
The music always slaps in BP.
Amazing
Collect your tissues here  👇🏿🤧🧻
Hope the Trailer Version also gets released. The one with the ambiental, violin strings, percussion and Kendrick Lamar's Vocals.
YHHHOOOOOOOO!!!!! 💖💖💖💖💖
It's simply  perfect. 10/10
Bob Marley and Chadwick smiling down on us from watching from God's Kingdom
Dude! This version hits hard...
I was waiting for this
Speechless...
The trailer was so emotional and epic, I am not hoping for a let down like Thor LAT and DrStrange MOM and Eternals
I like
Marvel, thank you so much for releasing this music, it was a highlight of an already fantastic trailer for Wakanda Forever.
I'm so Glad that This was on my #1 Most Anticipated Movie of 2022, I freaking can't wait to See This Movie

Wow thx for the proper release.
I'm not going to be prepared to say goodbye to Chadwick in the cinema. This will hit just as hard as Paul's send off in furious 7
Bob Marley x Marvel.... something i didnt expect but appreciate, mad love from the caribbean ✊🏾🙅🏾‍♂️

Masterpiece 😎🍷🍷🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺
MarvelMusicVEVO, is there any chance we could get soundtracks for Moon Knight and Ms. Marvel? Both shows featured amazing music.
Guys anyone has the epic version we ear in the trailer? This one is nice but I really loved the drums from the trailer one... kind of an epic version...

Marvel: Im not ready to be without you. T'Chala: A man who has not prepared his children for his own death has failed as a father. Have I ever failed you? Marvel: Never...
Been looking for this song since I heard it. Thank you❤️  Everything's gonna be alright 🤞
November can't come soo enough!

Tems sounds so beautiful ! And today July 25 is Rita Marleys Birthday.
Hearing this in the trailer just made me so emotional and Chadwick's whole MCU journey came to my mind
*With this song I'm one who considers it sacrosanct  that NO ONE should even attempt a remake . That said this version is fantastic*
amazing
This song in it self is beautiful.. But still were are the songs 'EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE ALRIGHT '  and ALRIGHT.. These 2 songs made this song just ❤️❤️
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I think there was too much humidity cause my eyes became watery
This got me tearing up during the trailer. Such a beautiful song.
Thank you Chadwick for bringing T’challa come to life during those wonderful years as the black panther💜💜 We will miss you💜💜
Everything gonna be alright just making me cry remembering the people I lost in the past😭😭❤️
Yo no paraba de ver el tráiler de Black Panther por esta canción y por la parte de Kendrick Lamar, suena genial ✨
