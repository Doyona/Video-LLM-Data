Shut up hezi sorry asf
that was awesome to watch. I like watching both of them in their own videos and they both fun to watch I know I am 3 years late lol
im so glad hezi lost he deserves that L what a sore loser to try to cheat and a clown for traveling like that
frida deserved that shizz!! way better baller ... other clown was fouling so much
Dev needs to stop hyping up carry god, dude carries the ball every other dribble.
I feel like frigga lets them comeback and win bc it means more to them than it does him lol hes way better player than mk and hezzi imo he just doesnt care as much lol
Whenever he hoops against a Hooper this is the outcome
Lmao bs. Travel everyday. Don’t drag out a W with hezi
The commentators saying a whole lot of nothing
These commentators yapping like crazy
Hezi is not good at shooting
HE WAS CARRYING SUITCASES ON THAT ONE 😂…
The days of games being this friendly and that many non Black people in the gym are long gone 😂
I fkn HATE Hezi! He so fkn lame. And he's just a dirty player. I see he been throwing his entire body into players when they beat him the same as he did to Scar. Just wild. Fkn bum fr
Hezi still don’t use his left
Friga always chokes..  Friga would be up by 10 and need 1 bucket and can never finish it off.. Always chokes and loses.
7:53 i forgot the name of this guy
The commentator said travel and then he says it ain’t my business
Friga is the reason YouTube 1s is where it’s at💯
Sounded like a straight valley girl “Keep f****** talking Jenna!”
Carry god crybaby
These announcers are dummies
This guy never goes left, just a few moves and always right. He doesn’t have a nice shot tho but the man will be killed at a higher level. Learning to use your left and right is importance to be that ball player
Friga is so trash idk why he even playing against hezi
The people standing on the side are kinda lame
Brah hezi walked so bad friga lost kuz he was being way too nice if that were it wouldn have been nothing to talk about like dev said
Hezi is dirttttttttt PLEASE!! Stop showing this man on this channel!!! Everyone else is good, but Hezi doesn’t play basketball!!! Wtf are y’all watching?
Hezi be carrying
Hezi most definitely traveled on that play
Ya'll have to stop using God's name in vain! God Bless you all✝🙏
Idk hezi ain’t nothing new but all respects
TRAVELED MY GUY 😂😂😂DAMN IF HEZI WIN THE GAME OFFICIALLY RUINED.
The less trashy win😂
I knew Hezi was going to lose
Watching in 24, Frig got so much better since then. He lights been top 5 them as well
Hezi cheats, cries, and still always loses
THIS SHIT BORING ALL THEY DO IS SHOT THREES 😴💤💤💤💤💤
Don’t want me to call the foul!  While hooking with off hand😂
Yeaaii frigaa🎉🎉🎉
29:10 ABSOLUTE TRAVEL
Friga is not the underdog hes just humbled
Lmao
Good game but travel
That aint no Hezigod....Thats Hezipoop.
Cheater is always a loser.
Traveling from usa to Antarctica with no passport.
The win is even more dominating when hezi does the travel, the ball wet excuse, the carries, the fouls and still loses
HEZI SLOB LOST AGAIN!!! GO CRY IN THE CORNER U BABY CRY
I want "I'm 40" dude count me in next year. I'm 42
I like the commentators repeating things 2 to 3 times. I like the commentators repeating things 2 to 3 times. I like the commentators repeating things 2 to 3 times.
D’God vs Hezontay
Hezi guy overrates himself
wait another year and this will be no-travel even in the NBA
Hezi need to a towel break every 5 buckets
if only no commentary on this shit they anooying asf
One of the commentators repeat himself ALOT "He got that. He got that" "Theres an open three. Theres an open three" the whole video. That was annoying.
Friga too nice dude needs to call His
contro verseeuhL
Y is bruh & everybody in his cheering section so obnoxious? Lol
Basketball the game of luck!
That’s a bucket? Mega travel lol
That friga hand on the head layup move is so cringey / corny lol
Hezi definitely hits woman
First he picked up his dribble and then got a checkup sayin the ball was wet smh, and then he takes four steps ona layup talkin bout “that’s a bucket” yes he’s good but cmon now he BSing
Hezi is so overrated fr. All he does is carry and travel. If it was called, he has no game just a wide body. Pull up I got a lb on it! @Aliencat420
friga was waaaaay to nice and still won. hezi traveled horribly bad. definetley friga won easy
Lets just say the celebration would have been a lot different if the other cat won..... bro almost a sore winner when he wins lmao
Hezi gave away too many chances.
I like hezi but he be cheating lol  Hella travels and offensive fouls.
I dont see any hezi from the guy name hezigod bro only thing he do is stepback midrange 😂😂😂
Nah that travel was insane
This nigga hezi push off on offense like no other and don’t get me started on his defense.  He don’t defend, he just foul.
They should've had refs, would have been a different game.
the commentary makes it so hard to watch  man, dude on the right is like a parrot and non stop talking over each other 🤦‍♂🤦‍♂
You're making it controversial,  by even making that statement.  You said out your own mouth yall have nothing to do with it 🤔🤔🤔🤔
DFriga is garbage 😂 yo man sucks Hezi goes against pros dfriga a Bum
That rim ain’t aligned
Way too much commentating
Hezi a cheater
That was a run
Travel
Dvontay is him
Ball don't lie. Hezi tried to use those calls to his advantage. Frigga deserves this win fair and square.
That was a travel
Hezi wack for this
Wiped his sneakers then the ball too many times . Gotta watch that funny ritual
Did house of hilights steal Devs idea?
Bro this just made me like friga more. That was clearly a travel than the possession after hezi jumps into him as he’s doing a lay up, needa jump straight up.
Friga got game. Mad humble and definitely passionate about the game. Not only that but those who loves to play. No harm no foul. Hezi got game. Humble when he wants to be. But he's tryna win at all cost he dont care about your feelings like that. Hezi god a different kinda dog when he riled up. Both dynamics will be a crazy reckoning on the courts together on the same team. Especially if they train and practice together. And work plays together. Yo! I feel sorry for whoever their opponents would be. 😂
What a Classic Epic Battle!  Wet Ball Exchange Rule Hella Stupid Though. This isnt Football Lol Last Game There Shoujd if been a ref. It sure if that was a travel vis Hezi God. Needed an Instant Replay and Call Via The Announcers. The Quality and Chalkengers Were Epic but a coupke aspects coujd def be altered. I really enjoyed this match up and respect both competitors. The respect they showed kne another was A One and deservedly so!!!! West_Coast_Kev_24  This match up did def not fissapoint. Hezi Gidd strategy initially looked like it woukd be a quick easy out but he turned it up when he needed to offensively. Hezi appears to not like okaying oerimiter defense which against Frig is not s good strategy but thats why hes the Hezi Gid. He does it his way Lol
Countless times in the geat of battle more times than i can recall id make eight threes in a row to the tube if a 32-15 victiry in onebifvthem games and 32-1 The Next!!  I did it to a Division two Hooper As Well!!!
Giving Frig ooen looks is kike an earky fatality, death wish! Yiure going to lose if yiu dont tighten up. Game far to easy!!!
Deestroying just emoting the whole time loool
Hezi is trash and don't do shit but foul and carry that basketball
I just don't get how people who play basketball for a living travels that much
Turn to Jesus people he died for your sins. Repent of what the New testament describes as sin. Believe the gospel get baptized and obey the teachings of Jesus. The gospel and the teachings of Jesus are documented in Matthew Mark Luke and John. Jesus is the only way to be saved God bless you all. If you have faith in Jesus through your faith you will live life with him as your example.../
I wanna see Hezi vs 40
Friga is better then hesi
if he didnt travel, he carried it to a different city right before .. so give it up.
Commentators stop talking so fast and stop talking at the same dam time
Friga was being nice. He wasn't going full 100 on the 2nd game.
Friga was a SUCKA the last game!!  Giving up the ball when it was CLEARLY his possessions!!!  The announcers were SUCKAS as well.  They didnt get involved on that Hezi travel but the one announcer said " I would have walked straight to the top and checked up.  MY BALL" . I wouldn't shoot for possession.  SUCKA MOVE.... JUSTMYOPINION
These commentators are annoying af 😂😅
traveL
Not hezi God, more like carry god
27:50 makes me so mad man. Has ball in hands, side step with the right, left lands as second step, picks up and re-establishes his pivot(travel) and the crowd goin crazy. BRUH
Hezi lost my respect after punching that Ref that wasn't cool at all
DAMNNNN
hezi overrated or underrated l?
Hezi Fraud
8:19 wtf, thats a foul
hezi is talented but the amount of ball carries is very unathletic on top of if anyone beats him to the hoop he uses his shoulder to stop the angle which are blatant fouls
18:29 😂🤣🤣
Typical....Hezi cheatein and and a guy much better than hime beats him.
Hezi can’tplay against real hoopers.
hezi really going out sad bro XD
Sucks u have to mute these announcers because they are terrible.
Hezi the hack-god
If hezi lose  10 pounds he b even  tougher
Wtf is that commentary, bro stfu instead of repeating the same things 2 or 3 times in a row
Hezi is all about dribbling, broke ass jumper 😂
Friga deserved that dub
Fasho hesi traveled
Hesitate deserved to lose that..shooting all them jumpers..smh..he had batter chances going for the lay ups last 2 points..🤦‍♂️
Bro on the right is copying everything guy on the left is saying.
Hezi can only beat smaller guards
Hezi a walking foul
Definitely the game of the decade of YouTube hoops
Hezi good at doing blocking fouls and pushing oh and also a lot of hacking.
I hate this new style of one on one like you dont have to get you own board or run for it  may this shit is trash
i keep saying when any with similar talent hezi is going to lose
Hezi a cry baby 😂
I will never understand why players rub the bottom of their shoe.
Mannn id cook the shit out of Hezi…he’s way too short 😂😂😂😂😂
Y’all need to put me in this
Hezi fraud should be his name because he sucks! No real skill only prison ball
Basketball Gods rewarded Friga, playing with integrity and heart 🫡 Nothing taken from Hezi though he missed a lot of shots that are like lay ups to him I want to see a rematch 💯
Bro hezi and friga only good hoopers in that gym not disrespecting but like creator league full of tik tokers not hoopers
Hezi just comes off as unlikable
No fouls???
Had to watch this on mute, clowns talk too much
Always enjoy seeing hezi get smashed
Dude over rated come to Chicago
I watched Herzigod shoot nothing but bricks against Mario. He is a clown with no game period
Dev be like “hes giving it to him…hes giving it to him” likee why he saying it like that😂😂😂😂
Henzi is a foul machine. He also travels alot
shouts to both competitors that was a great set of games! thoroughly entertained!! Good Ish FRIGA!!
ALL HEZI DO IS FOUL...EVERYTIME FRIGA GETS PAST THIS NIGGA HE THROW HIS WHOLE BODY AT FRIGA...HE DRIVE TO THE BASKET PUSHING AND ELBOWING FRIGS!...FOH! FRIGS NOT EVEN FOULING LIKE HEZI IS AND HEZ WALKED HIS ASS OFF THEN TALKING BOUT THATS A BUCKET
Every video I see of Hess, he can't shoot that well.
What is the reason to shoot from 3pt range? Low IQ level or something else??
This game is years old but most respect to Friga for just playing to the game. No theatrics or talking. Just letting the game speak. Honorable warrior.
“I know he HeziGod but he better turn into ClampGod” BRO IM GONNA PISS MYSELF LMAO😂😂😂
I'm disappointed with In The Lab for not speaking on that travel considering most of his videos are about violating playes who do
Am I the only one who was rooting for the Hezze!!!!???
I’m a die hard friga fan but he is an idiot for shooting that stupid 2 pointer 26:14when all he needed was 1 point what a dummy
Yall wayyyy too scared of Hezi. That was the most obvious walk 😂 we ain’t shooting for shit! And then he fouled the fuck out of him on game point and no one says anything?? I’m too glad Friga won.
Dev and Cel the best basketball commentators on me!
Hezi is a good player but he travels and Carry’s a lot , Good Game to friga
Friga 🦾🦾🤞🏽
This video made it to a million views, big ups to YouTube basketball 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The commentary is A+
Hezi only plays defense when he gets down on points. He don't play defense the entire game, that's why he lost.
3:36
On me that was off the chain tight 🔥Frfr first time on this channel… I’ve found something creative and great to see and learn from 💯💪🏿
If ya don’t know…hesi can’t not beat a small Asian kid name yukke in Japan!!!
Hezi so trash.. he the dirty lil boy in the hood that play football on the court🤦🏿🤦🏿
Why did you guys feel the need to narrate over the game?  I had to watch to this on mute.
These dudes missed more than they made!!! This guy called hezi who aint no god.....could go past this dude everytime! 😢
TRAVELLLLLLL
NO HE DIDNT BROOO.....You sounding SWEET 😂😂
Who ever scores gives the ball UP......WHAT ARE YA'LL PLAYING????  YA'LL YOUNGINS MESS ERRTHANG UP!!  PLAY DEFENSE TOO! 😢
This was terrible 😢
Hezi is always fouling
The mutual respect is 🫡 ‼️‼️‼️💯💯💯💯 this was an amazin matchup ‼️💯
Those side step makes with contests by both were sick. Fun watch
commentators are annoying AF. They just keep repeating words over and over. Boring. Stop talking. Let the guys play.
29:11 was not a travel clean bucket
Friga dont do shit but catch and shoot 1v1 skills highly overrated
That felt like a 30 minute movie scene. Respect to both players
Hezi's shot needs work.
Hezi vs Jimmy buckets next 🤩🤩
Only God is Jesus
Hezi traveled and made multiple fouls that Friga didn't even call. He's lucky Friga is a nice guy cause other Hezi would have lost in 2 sets!
Why did he have to travel at last he had it already tho
Jenner was rooting for friga too obviously 😂
Hezi is trash
This was pure💩🤷‍♂️💁‍♂️
Destroying out here filming he shoulda been out there hoopin 😂
this shit wild asf hezi a damn hack and just talked over everyone for his point to stand
Travel!!!!
I'd be a dope baller if I could just palm the ball everytime I'm dancing with it 😂
Hezicrybaby
Better be defense Jesus or something 😂
They should change hezi name from hezi to hacking god cause bruh fouls damn near every basket 😂
Hezi needs to know all these show off cool but it counts buckets
its really not that exciting
jenna hang around mongrels start actin like...
Last 30 seconds of video I hope hezi pulls him from half & shuts him up
Travel good for the win 😂😂 James harden of the YouTube ball community 😂😅
Who’s the best YouTuber atm I need new folks to watch I’ve lost interest in the overhyped guys
Not a fan of either one if I not interested ballislife again ima lose it 😂
The bias of the commentators for hezi is palpable.
That boy took 4 whole steps, and talking bout "that's a bucket"🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣The comedy
I gotta say it.... Y'all talking is irritating the shit outta me!
both trash
Classic corny hezi but got beaten unlike in the streets bc friga wasn't someoje who is execising he is a hooper😂
Seriously Hezi is going to argue a travelling call when he took 4 steps to the bucket?
Let him shoot  all day.   Miss miss miss
It looks different when it ain't on hezi gods channel🤣😂🤣
*Egregious traveling violation.*
Theres Other Videos where they straight getting physical , why Here Theres directly distance between they Defender and the attacker ?  IS IT different Rules ?  IS IT cleared befor they matchup  I dont understand the difference in the Aggression   To me aggressive Play is Nothing to worry about but then everyone has to be fair with Fouls  But im Just watching blown Up Egos Like balloons  Maybe Someone can explain why their 1on 1 is This different from the Aggression and the distance of the opponents
Respect
He took 3 real steps. TRAVEL.
Ain't hezigod the dude who travels like crazy
can y’all show basketball more than the reporters next time bro fr
Stay Humble. Come out on top. That's how the most high works. Good runs.
Ball Hard or Go Home
22:25 Hezi knew he got caught and had to pretend like it was cuz the ball was wet....smh just play, quit inventing excuses
Im sry but i still dont know what alot of people see in hezi ive seen people stand in front of him and he miss, miss, and miss he is streaky but not a good shooter so if he cant break u down u have a chance.. i cant beat him no.. because i dont practice everyday and i dont condition like he does but take me back to 21 22 ill put my house on it..
Ball don’t lie 😂
Friga too generous
Lolo baby
This was painfully boring basketball.
I legit watched this on mute y’all mfs just rambling for no reason at all …………
I know Hezi's favorite player is Harden
The commentary for this broadcast was impeccable, astonishing, attention-grabbing, definitely would like to see them on much more! From the sweat drippings (hezi)to the tattoo jokes (friga) 😂 keep doing y'all thing man fr💯💯
I was rooting for you Friga.
Neither one play defense either 😂
Hezi has never had a shot. Streak shooter at best
Hezi my guy still that boy a dog on the court
HEZI definitely traveled though.
Frigas too nice. He never calls fouls on these dudes. Sometimes you have to because they ain’t giving you Nathan.
The instant someone wipes the bottom of their shoes with their hands, I discount them as a real baller
For that wet ball excuse. Dude should've lost just for that. You don't stop mid play for no shit like that.
Hez carries to much
Why not use the cameras to prove travel?
Down to the wire
hezi traveled 9-10
Hezi travels and push off everytime
Nigga went to Mexico talking bout “bucket” what he meant to say was “suitcase” fuck wrong 😂😂😂😂
Hezi fouled Friga every single time he drove to the basket. Friga wins in 2, EASY if Hezi isn’t allowed  to foul and travel.
Had to watch this thing on mute lol
Friga coulda swept him to be honest, you know Hezi gon do a step back, its predictable as hell & Friga kept goin for 3's, gotta go inside, post-ups, mid-range step backs, floaters, spin moves, gotta use all that & keep your defender guessin. Great win though Friga
I juss don't why someone would shoot 3's especially back to back juss to get 2 total points cause your goin by all 1's
is that Spencer Dinwiddie commentating?
The dude in black made it much harder on himself by his unwillingness to just put his hand up on most of those deep shots. If he'd just put his hand up, 50% of those shots could have missed. I don't know if he did it because his game plan was to challenge the dude in white to take them, or what. But he made it so much harder on himself. I think the dude in black was faster, better at offense & defense, if he just would have actually played defense by putting his hands up.
I just wish there was a dribble limit.
My goodness....these commentators are awful.  But these 1vs1s are dope lol
Love this🏀 hezi looks a little out of shape
classic
This travel was so fun
I never understood taking the ball out after every shot attempt. It slows the game down to a crawl.
Don’t be nice, he wouldn’t be
Buncha so called “hoopers” in there but nobody wanna call travel when they called 🤦🏽‍♂️ smh pusio
When someone is actually playing defense Bumgod don’t score
@6:56 that girl yelling in the background is corny af  bc no one even payed her any attention when she said what she said. Lame 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Hezi carries the ball every possession but he thf
Friga still won
hard to defend a player who carries the ball on every play
worst commentary EVER
this dude travels every play
HEZI the travel GOD   I loved it hehe
One of the best and respectful 1v1s you’ll find on YouTube 🔥
That’s a bucket bro that’s a bucket bro
These was some weak 1s they showed no creativity all they did was shoot 3s so lazy
Hezi be fouling call him HackGod,  its streetball tho so i get it but when you talking leagues you gotta learn to play good D
Man! I see Hezi's highlights popping up on me every time and you would think he never misses. I was thinking he would be a lot better. Almost seems like he can barely shoot or maybe it's just me... smdh
hezigod did travel now it was 3 steps
Hezi mad he lost lmfao
The commenters are trash
1. Dev. 2. Hezi. 3. Chris stapleton. 4. Friga.  White iverson. 5. Caleb.   Top 5 players there right now
I wish they would just let dev in the lab talk the other guy is really not good and he just says stupid shit
For being called hezi all he does is take outside shots  💀💀💀
27:50 was a massive travel. Atleast 5
Nah hesi a cheater 🤣🤣
Hezi traveled his ass off
This man lose all the time 😭
With that much space I would kill hezi plus hezi is too small. This would be a murder show. Even out of shape I’ll still give this ball carry travel agent that work.
Deestroying in the mix 💯
Anthony The Champ De Jesus  set it up.🎉
28:01 Travel 28:13 Travel
Finally Hezi gets exposed for what he is. A and1 player. Not a hooper
Hezi been commiting a lot of fouls since his game against Mario Chalmers… and he still looses games respectfully !! He tries hard to bail himself with game Ws !  I know one player in the NBA right now who keeps convincing hard the world about something but it’s not working!  im not gone say his name! His fans are like cult believers, they looses it really quick, 0 to 100 in 3secs !!!!
Awesome play and commentary
Friga on Big 3
It’s very hard to like Hez. Screaming at a woman and claiming all his errors are from a wet ball. Clearly traveled at least 3 times and won’t admit it. He’s always crying and making excuses. That’s why he will stay at the level he’s at. Oh yea and all the blatant ball carries hez does as well. They only time I wanted Hezi to win was against Dunbar because he has a bad attitude and isn’t very good. Don’t get me started on Tim Carter that guy is a basketball bum and plays ball like a linebacker. Tim sucks I can’t stand seeing that guy.
Nigga don't nobody care about you blocking them lol. More where that came from
Bruh why he dont go left, just right side layups or a shot every play
Just watching all of these Guys at some point in time, I Favor Jlew and Scar… because they both are the Shiftiest of the bunch in my opinion… And they create better space and more open shots for themselves
You cheat in the game of basketball you'll cheat in life. Integrity wins you more than games. I would rather lose honorably than win with an asterisk.   Hezi lost a lot of my respect. The basketball Gods smiled on Friga.
Friga got flat out robbed on the foul calls and still won, kudos!
Friga is inspirational to watch. His style of content and in the game of ball!
a little overflow 🤣
how tall is. hezi
💯 bravo to both athletes.
I gotta watch this on mute. These dudes just saying anything lls
i saw hezi call himself hood kyrie the other day that man is fucjing trash ain’t no way ur calling urself kyrie with a brick ass shot and no ball control foh
Is that Deestroying from YouTube? The football guy?
garbage
Ele é ORIGINAL FDS 😂😂😂
That was 🎉🔥🔥🔥🔥
Hezi went to mexico and back on that travel
Single rim, inside court,no dribble count. Come back to Davenport Friga
Real hoopers are born in Akron come find out
Idc man hezi is TRASH
Hezi did great compared to the weight/height. 1v1 is a different game.
Hezi has no defense!!!!
Hezi be carrieing a lot low key look closely
Mf cheated and still lost. I can’t stand his sorry ass
Good game definitely traveled
Why does he keep wiping the bottom of his sneakers? Weird shit
How is this entertaining? No rebounds no hustle just shooting and dribbling. I'd rather watch Special Olympics or wheelchair basketball.
Travel and carry =Hezi
Fouling, complaining about calls, then taking the soft calls himself…dude‘s got no class.
Bad name -- There is no god except Allaah.
7:18 This carry was egregious😂😂😂
hezi def traveled
This man mispronounced controversial 6 times 😂
Hesi so overhyped I’m glad he finally went up against someone who ACTUALLY hoops and takes basketball serious . If hesi don’t showboat half the time he plays he would actually get some good work in . You can’t just tell by how friga hoops he don’t play around . And he also don’t call no sorry ass  fouls , just keeps it pushin and the basketball gods really did bless him in the end . Stay humble my friends
Hezi is a bum.
takes 3 steps "that's a bucket yo"
Either way that was incredible. Y'all are shitting on modern basketball content. Please keep it up.
FRIGA WON PERIOD. HE WON FROM THE BEGINNING. Hezi is a Bandit on that court no doubt about it but he plays without honor when things don't go his way and that's why he lost. Inside he knew. Bro bested him. This games about tactics not pride. Tacticians become champions. All he had to do was play defense and stop tryna belittle bruhs game. He would have won.
When’s the next one a year pass and can I get a invite
Where my boy jessy jones at he would cook hezi
Friga got a clip
Hezi needs to work on his jump shot and play defense
Thats a ridiculous travel hesi
hezi arguing that travel call lmfao. man took 5 steps
The definition of a gather is when the player has control of the ball (can hold it, change hands, pass or shoot). I'd say that happened when his hand was under the ball.  After that point, he took 2 steps and jumped.  As crazy as it looked, I don't think Hezi traveled based on nba rules.
Naw this was good fr fr but I knew friga was gonna pull out the W cuz his shot too pure and hezi does not like trying on defense strictly because it takes away from his offense on some James Harden shit. Friga uses his dribble with more purpose than Hezi as well therefor he conserves more energy on offense. This allows Friga to be able to try on defense without losing as much energy for his offense in the process.
Great game super entertaining hezi don’t ever change bro 😎  Friga is your name n*gga with a F ? 😂 that gotta be the greatest nickname ever
As far as the ball getting wet and slippery, if they would use an actual real NBA ball, those get stickier and better when your hands get sweaty.
people actually pay to watch some cats play 1 on 1 now a days huh? We effed this generation up
how tall is this Hezi dude
Nice take down... Hezi plays bully ball, with his mouth! 😅
I’m a Hezi fan, but Hezi is a fucking cheater straight up…
damn this battle was nice. fair and just plain sports. dont care how they hate hezi here but he did good and he gave his prior travel justice on his next possesion. staff and crew who managed this was great.
30:03  dev saying controversial exactly how it’s spelled . 😂
Hacking-God a hesi only works if you can shoot
Ball game. I respect that guy.
Hezi done fouled out
Hezi be hacking lol
lol how is 4 steps "a bucket"
Friga is too nice lol he way better than Hezi. He let him stay in these games for his pride.
Three minutes into this… turned the volume all the way down. These dudes annoying
Friga needed this win... Hezi's rep is already fully established and solid and can't be damaged! Hat's off to the both of them for such a good game.. Had me sweating like I was there!!!
Hezi took 5 steps, hacking, making excuses the ball is sweaty when he got shut down. Calling weak ones. Friga earned my respect today 🙌
This is not a true one on one. Get your own rebounds, Hussle and make'm take'm. The game is a continuation only stopping on made buckets and called fouls. Only one person shoots for the ball during disputed calls.
Are all these dudes prospects ?
29:12 maraton.
Hezi defense is terrible. He hacking damn near every drive. Never been nice to me like that
That was a travel!
this was an anime boss battle
hezi lost the game and the respect damn
Here for the first time. This is legendary. Almost a million views. Much respect to both.
Two guys battling...playing hard...No crying....#RESPECT to both!! " If we didn't call the earlier one's, I can't call that..."...and play on...
Is that Boone Jenner?
hezi traveled he took 3 steps
Hezi-god needs to be a defensive-disciple
@31:38 everyone laughing at him😂
He carried before the actual drive itself.  Not hating on him.  Respect to both.  Imo he has his hand under the ball enough to consider it a carry so he is really bending the rules.  People are talking about number of steps, when I slowed it down his hand looks like its under the ball which created the unnatural hesi to let him blow by
That was a foul hezi
Hezi jumped all on Friga back talkin' bout "I jumped straight up wit em!" Nah bro, you jumped straight on him. That was a good 1v1 tho. I've been sayin' they needed to do that long before they knew of each other I believe.
NBA wannabees
Too many unnecessary stepbacks for me to keep watching
Great video  Could have gone either way….2 studs
HEZI YOU TRAVELED GET THE FUCK OUTTTAAA HEREEEEE WITH THAT BULLSHIT AND YOU FOULED ON THAT LAST PLAY
Bwahahahaha hezi 👎🏿
Hezi be super carrying
Sheeeesh.
Hezi is a no name brand bone collector
Good stuff
Friga  can palm the ball ,you should rarely miss a shot !!!
Awesome video
OMG the eyebrows are always 100% up on this guy lol
They brought in Spencer Twinwiddie for the commentary
aint gonna lie- this is the best non pro 1v1 on yt rn
The basketball gods will reward you for being honest
Hezi got bars lol
Hezi a joke when it comes to real competition without edit. His defense is nothing but how to foul and try getting away with it. He knows he traveled. I don't understand why Frigga didn't put him away a long time ago.
All those sideline npc’s who thirst for some camera time 😂
nothing in this video warranted u guys breathing in so hard after every shot taken
Hezi overrated as hell, at least 2 or 3 of those calls were not fouls  Dude wants to be the aggressor and not be touched doing all that wild shit !  No Foul ! Lettem Play
When the announcer said "this is intimate" I checked out. Mase and Cam wouldn't allow that.
Omg why this commentator always repeat his phrase. Thats so annoying!
Hezi is one of the most unlikeable youtube hoopers.  He's that one dude in every L.A. Fitness gym.  He's got skills, it's his lack of respect for everything about the game itself that irks people.
Wait… why #21?
Bro went from hezi god to hezi prophet the first game
Hezi is all ego , calf muscle and ego 😂
Friga is just too respectful 😂, took the dub and bein cheated by hezi lmaoo good game tho
travel 29:19
Yo the game better with no volume 😂😳🤦🏿‍♂️🤷🏿‍♂️😎
where the ref hezi fouling and mos def took an extra step ... ggs ... frigga aint showing much other than the three line and a few right hand well contested lays ... step up the skills frigg you got the resources ,,,
Friga seems scared or timid to make a foul call…wants to be everybody’s friend.    That is a weakness.
"Defensive Jesus "
BALL DON"T LIEEE
So wholesome
Hezi dude is tiny
damnnn how Hezi didn’t win last game after going up 6-0😮‍💨 I was hoping he win frl
I know he a hezi god but he better be a defensive god that was funny
You walked Hezi, took 5 steps.
What is wrong with Frogs? Attack the rim bro.
Thats crazy that its actually not a travel lol. Why did it look like a travel so much
Commentator with the fro was goofy n boring asf
hezigod aka carry god. my man's trash
I noticed Friga has great shooting but he's handling and drive to the hoop is good and he doesn't use it like he should
what kind of shoes is hexi rockin
Great game!  I just love Friga’s all around fairness.
Commentary was, to loud and horrible. I cut it out within the time it took me to write this. 1 min. Garbage. Block me for sure, please. Horrible the voices were like fingernails on a chalkboard....
Fri should've been wrapped the game up
Friga won on buckets and the honesty bag; he's too nice & it almost cost him...but always karma 🙏
Man Ian even know u had a yt😭I b fw the telling on the gram
Soencie dinwiddie went to commentating???
so happy friga won but I love them both, I would of said if hezzi won lol
one of my favorite videos love it thank yah :)
Da fuq is destroying doing there
i hate playing with players like hezi , the moment he faces challenge u know he is going to cheat his way , he is also a bad winner and a sore  loser
Best 1v1 I ever seen in my fucking life yo
hezi traveled to mexico and back
so many travels
Dude was traveling everywhere how y’all not see this!
Hezi is a offensive player not defense the dude had free shots almost the whole game
Is there a echo in the audio 😂
Did bro really say “WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT??? I DIDNT SWIPE DOWN I JUST WENT UP WITH EEM”??? He kno it’s on tape right??? And that travel when yo said “that’s a bucket, bro took 5 steps! That’s why nobody fw bro like dat, all his cryin n wining whenever he not winnin be the worrrrrrst!!!!!
I hate this style of 1v1, make those pussies rebound and do some dirty work. Save energy? Wtf
Friga too dam nice
Let’s let’s repeat repeat repeat ourselves ourselves ourselves. Let’s let’s repeat repeat ourselves.
Hezi said "Game".... 🤷‍♂️?"what he said"🤣🤣🤣🤣 he missed lol. Hezi couldn't beat Friga... he calm and humble.. Hezi acting up whole game. He lost the game cuz he playing around too much. If hezi just play the damn game, he would have won by his speed but he choose to play around.
Frig won the game and shown some class as well.
Commentators need STFU! We all want to enjoy the game without stupid Commentators...
We need a 40 and over…
Commentators hesi fans. But any person who plays knew he couldn’t win. Game ain’t good enough that’s the best way to say it.
announcers keep saying things like 3 times in a row, so weird
I played Hezi 1v1 game went to 3 sore was 3 to 1 he won
This was trash
Hezi is overrated
Commentator: deez 1V1's gettin real intimate Zesty Light Skinned Nikka'z: 🗿
Yeah, hezi traveled
23:37 That’s a poster
Dude took 10 steps and called it a bucket… hezi is so trashhhhhhh
8:16 brah i just absolutely hate this type of defense like nothing is more annoying when i blow by someone and they  do this bs
picks ball up and says the ball is wet
Bro that was the biggest travel ever. No way am I shooting for that.
Not so easy Hezi when it’s not little dudes like Julian huh 🤔
Jenna low key look good though #tlkabtit….
If Jenna would’ve kept talking hezi would’ve demolished friga😂
little dude is trash haha
The Hezi(push)GOD
I want friga a million times over hezi mid
For real, it wasn't a travel
hezi nasty mf
I'm so sick of all this hype about Hezi "god" this dude isn't even that good!  That was definitely a travel. Man, the bullies always complain the most when the odds are against them 🤣  Friga on the other hand, phenomenal player and person.
2 of the best
Carry every time
Real ballers know Frigga is not the underdog.
Bring in ISO JOE
Hezi cheated that man on so many calls
Traveled like a mf
They boy stiff arming like hell
So Hezi is the HackGod cause goddamn every play??
Carry God!!!
HeZi is the 🐐 Right next to him is Skoob
🤣🤣🤣👎👎👎
man they're just good at the fucking game man. they're just good at basketball.
What you gotta do to get involved with in the lab?
Travel bruh.. with all due respect..
Last comment they called the travel and the foul at the announce table rite when it happen 🤣🤣🤣he a cheater too I see
That boi the carry God so cocky I love see in em lose🤣🤣🤣🤣
He clearly swiped down friga nice ahz
Clown Trash!
I'm embarrassed that I've only caught on to this a year later smh but wow!!! thank you guys......truly a great achievement. I am so glad I found this.....great viewing and entertainment.
Hezi walked
Hezi be pushing off like crazy
Dopppeee
2 before I knew I was sports gaming soon.
Great battle but Im glad Friga won 🔥
when he said unlimited dribble limit, does that mean double dribble is cool/allowed?
Hezi be carrying like a mf or am I tripping?🤔
Best 1v1 that i've seen
🔝🔝🔝🔝🔝🔝🔝
Dev says everything twice… everything twice.
Bruh walking in Memphis with that travel😂😂😂😂
hezi traveled
bruh traveled to my dad 29:10
difference between these guys and nba players seems to be shooting % on uncontested shots
This was great ...but Hezi was supposed to carry that "Keep Talkin Jenna" energy for the rest of the game 😂
15:00 that dance when you pull out your favorite go to moves. He knew it was time.
8:17 how Hezi get the ball?  somebody please make it make sense
bro hezi clearly took 3 steps but frig still won so ggs
W game
Hezi most definitely traveled on that one play
This was great... we need to see that Bree Green v Jenna though
The double dribble god
Friga Hezi and Chris white MY 3 MAN TEAM
That's a great watch. I'm gritting my teeth since game 3 6-6. And that crossover from Friga is nice.  I really love this game.
Thanks for the work fellas. I enjoyed it.
that girl bandy has a crush on friga
He did travel doe & got away & no foul @ the end in my eyes but still a good run
Bing bong
"This ain't ma battle"  RESPECT DA 1v1
What can we say? Cheated twice and still lost, was it actually close?
Hezi didn't foul he knew everyone would object due to the atmospheric intensity of the game down the stretch it was felt by everyone CLEARLY so he had to make things clear firsthand.
Am I the only person who thinks that Hezigod can only get separation when he gets a push off?
Don't think it was travel
100% a travel lol.. if he'd jumped off his left it'd been clean, but took a extra step with jumping off right.
“I had to step in and say something” 😐
The ball never lied on this game
I got next
Not sure if people notice but the highlight of these videos is the commentary
Hell no wtf with that ya letting Hezi do that bs
Hezi won in my opinion. He never traveled
por que HEZIGOD no cubre a friga? JAJAJAJAJAJAJA el juega sin cubrirle
nice concept my only complaint would be better commentary
Friga better shooter hezi better in open court
I know Friga I live in south Florida with his people
Never heard of this channel but you got like 600k followers man I gotta get my sports channel going
I want to play @dfriga
"IM JuST GoNe BLoCk yOu" lmfao you sound mad hurt bout they comments why waste time in the comments
you guys dont have flight in the crowd
Dev and Friga the coldest hoopers out there
My balls was clenched the whole game….😂
Both are trash!!
Drive and post more, damn New school is whack  Ya'll playing 1v1 or horse ? 🤦🏽
Yb walked home and back
Thank goodness the first basket was a drive to the basket smdh all these 1 vs 1 be the same. A bunch of 3 pointers and forced shots with anyone barely trying to attack the basket. In a 1 vs 1 90 percent is going to be shooting and the majority can't shoot like that.
“The ball is wet” is a first 🫤
Friga wins my respect
hezi shouldve kept taking him, frig a sniper tho
In honesty....The game was compromised....kuz Hezi shouldve never got that possession he legit took 3 steps and traveled...that compromised the game....but Friga still won so...ball dont lie
HEZI YOU TRAVELED💯💯💯....I SLOWED MY VIDEO SPEED DOWN YOU DEFINITELY TRAVELED.
I TOLD YALL HE IS DIFFERENT!!🔥🔥   Hezi Is NOT NORMAL!
both of these dude play dumb
hezi  a sucker play ball sweat you knew  that when you got the ball he was stuck
where you play and you don't have to get a rebound  I must be old
Hezi god is terrible… d friga good but these one on ones are so stupid they might as well have a shooting contest
if i never saw a travel in my life bro lmao this guy cheated friga on a travel and a foul with cameras everywhere. No respect to who friga was playing.
Great commentary
Nobody got post moves.  Just shoot or drive.
How do I get in these games?  None of em even take defense seriously.  Easy work
32:00 haha he dont like Friga... only one big G God  and  Prolly SMH at hoops.  Follow Jesus not YouTube yall
Mannnn Hezi travel his ass off🤣💀
Definitely a travel.  He even had to jump off his nonconventional foot to finish.  We really don’t have the angle to say if that was a file or not.
So glad I found these videos.  Hezi shit talking is top notch.
Hezi seems very insecure 😅
Hezi is the chef genaral
Let's get Bone Collector vs HeziGod!!
Stop filming the girls, who gives a shit about them???
Shooting 3’s on game point 🤦🏾‍♂️
Hezi is trash I told u ... u Kan only street ball.. once he locked down he kant do shit
Hezi is trash I told u ... u Kan only street ball.. once he locked down he kant do shit
There we go!!!!!
Does Hezi go left?
sign me up
Hezi traveled his ass off foh Lmfaoo goofy ass lyin as
Hesi needs to play better defense he just leaving him open
Hezi walked hard asf. 😂😂😂👎🏽
Hezi got moves but no left
Hezi WANTED to lose. NO DEFENSE!!
The way y’all playing I can beat both of yall
Friga said “this the stuff you pay for” mf I don’t even pay for nba league pass why in the FUCK would I pay for this 😂😂
Nice rig!
There are some great ballers in this video,
8:19 why wasn't it a foul?
Hezi is boring, all you have to do is sit and let him shoot the jumper. Only way he wins is if he is having a lucky day
Hezi problem is he not a great shooter so dude could play him with space
He traveled at 13:58
Let’s go friga strength and honor 💪🏾💪🏾
That was definitely a travel.
Bum hezi
Hezi is weak as hell. First that mean travel and then a hard foul talking about he jumped straight up. Fuck outta here
Hey guys for future reference the hand to hand reference in spanish is " mano a mano "  ( letter  "a " is pronounced  " ah " )
100 percent a travel
Hezi is weak and loud that's why he lost
Good game
Easy money
Hezi carried and traveled to tie the game up
At the end commentators were rooting for Friga 😂😂😂 called his fouls, said shoot for it. After all that talk then claim to back out, smh
How's a god gonna Travel ...😂😂😂😂😂
Travel
15:33 that was so creative, he said something so simple but got them talking
LETS GOOO FRIGA
You don't have to fill every single second with commentary
dude said he doesn't like friga what a weirdo
31:40 he jumped on him
Must See TV
Why Cel never 1v1’d Dev?
Hezi TRAVELLED LIKE A MUTHAFUCKA!
This is a good example of basketball 1 v 1 no street baller travelling moves. I love the energy and talent of this ballers! 🏀 lesson is do not celebrate too early!
🔥🔥
Men, a thing is better put your cam do many time, maybe put a rectangle in the bottom right with you. But I love you guy, I really pleasure, good work♥️🏀
Friga, stop being so passive my guy....Need a little more dog in you for this type of stuff...
Hezi carries a lot is it just me
This was great, but whatever happened to gettin the rebound, clearing, then making your move/shot? This new 1 on 1 is lazy seeming, lol!🤣😂
Notice ol girl switched up and start being on Hezi God team...lol
Friga need to be more alpha, he was letting himself get cheated the whole game and hesi plays d like a bitch, just slapping and body checkin every time this dude drove. They need to have a ref if they going to take this serious.
unless hezi just cappin...he carried and travelled twice (this carrying the ball has gotta stop) right when dude was saying that handle is crazy...both feet left the ground, left foot planted first, then the right, then a dribble...travel or carry(you choose, he literally did boffem)...one bonce, right , left, right, bucket...he aint travel, he teleported.
Hezi lame af bro trash fr
Friga was irritating with all of the 3 attempts. Not one post move at his size nor did he switch up his tempo/energy to throw hezi off- he should've won long time ago
All that dribbling just to pull up from deep. What a waist!
Wow I have never seen a one on one like this before  - talk about adversity,  talk about character. Both men did well
Hezi fouls, he don't play proper D.  Clowns like him injure other players and  He complains n makes excuses  F Off
I don't get it you call yourself hezi God but taking outside shots🤦😭😭😭😭
every single play... omg wow omg... wow!!! crazy shot!!! what a show people!!! amazing!!! like bro they dont even announce lebron like that stop it
the announcers annoying af fanboying so damn bad
https://youtu.be/Dr0-QiJZ2m0?t=1887 Hezi doesn't even wait for anyone. Just starts protesting to the foul call. No foul was called. It's an admission of guilt.
This is dope yo.
This was a good game
Hezi 🗑🗑🗑🗑
That was dope
I need some
Friga defense don’t get highlighted enough fr
Only needed to see the first game lol. This is corny. Commentators for what? Shud just be two guys in the gym. Imagine calling urself god anything, then losing bad
I need a rematch of this..I’m sorry this was too good
those commentators look dumb af. esp marcelas xd
That wasn't a travel, that was a journey.
Friga way better, On God.
Why is that one guy repeating himself ?
WE KNOW THAT SNATCH
Hezi  is the street James Harden cause he is always traveling I swear and he thinks it's a great move frank nitty put him in his place  I haven't seen the ending of this yet so I don't know the  end yet
Hezi intemidated you all he freaking traveled!cowards!!!!!!!
Frogs is all class and razor sharp!
hes still not better lol but ok these rules are dumba asf if I score and say a call.... we shoot for it and I win the shootout...i get my dam point and retain ball lol weird ass rules #HG in my book oh well gg
The commentators acc the most annoying thing I’ve ever had to deal with
I hope since it's been months the commentators  are better. In This video they ass. But the video deserves a like
He said the rim is tricky...
Hezi plays no defense 😂
Lol at not dribbling once inside the 3 point line, making a close layup and then having the audacity to say "that's a bucket"
That's a LeBron travel right there fam
Hesi did not diserve to win he was cheating there was a clear travel then there was a clear foul in the end he lost anyways
They should make rukes like if you shoot 3 you can rebound if you shoot 2 and miss then the other guy gets tur ball
Devin really said he don't like Friga when his boy, Hezi was a clown all match
I would have loved to just here the players mic'ed up without thr commentary.
What kind of a person call himself GOD but complains and keeps losing all the 1 v/s 1 battles  🤦‍♂️
Damn the Reach killed him
Boys is playing mannnn
Friggaaa
개머싰네
That was epic and highly entertaining for a one on one match up.  Pretty even match up.
Hezi got better since this. I’d like to see a rematch
Ball don’t lie 🫡
5:59 marcelas says "lay me" dude in the pink shirt literally mouths it out at the same time
29:20 That's a bucket 😂😂😂😂
Hezi can't go left!!!!! Nitty exposed him
Friga is a good person and very good player!!!
That was a walk
Devin doesnt know how to pronounce controversial
hezi so unfair i got no respect for this guy he’s such a child he can’t admit anyyrbkng
That travel call was tough. If Hezi put that left foot down at the same time as the dribble instead of after the dribble, then it's a good bucket. But the left foot went down after the dribble so it counts as the gather making that step with the right foot count as 1. Had to slow it down to .25x speed to be able to actually see the timing.
Friga plays with so much calmness and confidence. It tough to beat version 6.0 of Friga.
Bra dev said it🤣 hezi always sweatin like shit
hoopers like hezi piss me off cry babies and cheat to win. im glad friga won, man was honest and gave hezi all the bs calls lol
had to watch this on mute
Hezi god vs white iverson?
Hezi get respect for not calling foul that's why the streets love him
Travel
Been a fan of Hesi Gawd longer so was rooting for him til he traveled n argued that foul at 10-10. Glad Friga won. But I'ma simple man...I see these 2 names n I click the video. U guys just earned a new subscription from ya boy. Plus dope to see a bunch of top notch street ballers n YouTubers all together for positivity
He walked his ass off they tried to cheat...talkn bout shoot for it...how about run the footage back and see for yourself...
Hezi being in his 30s versus Friga low 20s, I relate to Hezi. Playing ball in our 30s against these youngins when we’ve lost a step or two
Shorty with black hair can get it
Felt like I was watching tnt game homeboy got future broadcasting.
Friga really let’s his game talk instead
Everytime a shot go up "Ooooooooooo"
wait how you shoot for it on a obvious travel? Im out
It was at least 3 steps 1 extra he didn't need
15:51 wtf Cel just gonna disappear like that on some Chris Angel shit??
Ball dont lie.
that was not a travel(hezi did in game3), it was perfectly "0, 1, 2" steps.
I love the street rules no cap
Yella beezy?
30:55 except it is a travel lmao he took 3 steps
Was cool til homie brought🐂💩in the game.
TRAVEL HEZI TAKE YO Ls  LAME BOI
Host are biased man
That game was crazyyyy...had me sweatin
get proper full grain leather balls for this. Synthetic sux for indoor
big fan of hezi god but he be cheatin his ass off lol always fouling in the hole nd all
Hezi traveled, hella be hackin, AND all the shit! 😂 He’s a competitor, but he be cheatin like fuck 😂
HEZI TOOK 5 STEPS AND SAID THATS A BUCKET
Hesi seems like the worst person to play with or against. Completely uncoachable. That's why he's playing pick up games and not in the league.
Hezi carried AND traveled at 29:10 🤣
“Ion know where he got that from , I ain’t gonna take credit for it” 🤣
he traveled
Crazy game 👏
This was fire man sheesh
Best 1 on 1
the fuck happened at 22:25 man thats a turnover foh
29:10 Once you carry, the gather step already happens so thats a travel.
So cool 😎 keep it up brother God bless🙌....Hezi God is a solid guard
The commentary sucked !
Buddy traveled the world
man picked up his dribble was caught dead on the 3 with no chance to do anything with it... "balls wet" lol
I’m team Hezi all day but you can’t let Friga shoot open shots. He’s automatic. Yes Hezi traveled. I thought the fouling was fair on both ends. Hezi just missed too many
HEZI WOULD LOVE PLAYING HERE BIG SHOUTS TO Hezi
See shot fKe drive jab step fly bye point good job Friga
That's my five meeting everyone on the tube
Shouts out to Chauncy too I went to Chauncy rose
And Friga straight up
My favorite players millii w iverson Hezi ClMp god
Hezi is a gimmick. And he hacked the whole game. Plus he traveled.
🖤
This was wild! But that was definitely a travel on hezi! Lmao homeboy took like 6 steps!
I want the smoke if this how y’all playin for bread lol one guy can’t go left at ALL and the other can’t even dribble. Respectfully.
Hezi traveled hella hard
Dee looking like he took way to much perks, either he’s jumping like a dolphin or his neck spazzing out 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Jesus friga needa ask the announcers how hezi god meat taste🤣🤣🤣like dayum we know who they wanna win
Seeing Deestroying out there was dope to see lol two words. "GRIP. BOOST!"
I knew it was worth watching friga the og
Been a villain
That was a good game!   I was up from my seat.
That was so intense!! Great games.
Super.     EXTRA 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯✔️ and 😂🤣🤣.  👊🏾🔥
these dudes not even drivin to the paint
This nigga traveled 😂😂
HESI the travel foul cry god
my boy destroying here
send hezi left
🔥🔥🔥
Hesi a sore loser
What are the rules? First it was all 1's then the 3rd game it was 1's and 2's?? My bad if I'm missing something.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Hezi gotta work on his def i never see him play hard def 4r
No rebounds? Rebounds give you energy, set ups and momentum
They should play regular basketball, chase rebounds and all.  One and done ain't it.
This is absolutely terrible.  This new generation can't even play 1 on 1 right. Wtf was this garbage
friga don't play aggressive at all
This was dope af
This white dude and his 4 step harden step back should never be allowed to call a travel ever
First game is tht all tht really matters
Friga the🐐
https://youtu.be/7wKlyMxBgtI
"They mic'd up" ... But we can hear shit because the commentators were rambling on like some dopes in a movie theater.  I really wanted to watch these two...but I couldn't finished due to the stupid commentary.  The world won't end if you let some air space occur and talk a little slower.
Friga: *Dribbles*  Devin: Oooooooooooo
Hezi god fuu asf to me on godd I see yo many people like him playing basketball
Y’all gotta put me in
Love this
How come he kept saying it’s intimate 🤨
Godbless amen
Its wet im dead
Friga won when hezi shook his hand saying he swore to the basketball gods he ain’t travel . 🧢
Commentary bout dry asl
Destroying tries so so hard
Thanks you for this bro , much love
Dudeee hezis a fkn hack and a half
This Hezi dude literally plays no defense.  Just prays for a missed shot!  Reminds me of a bunch bums from an adult league I play in!
He traveled 3rd game at the end 🤣🤣🤣 Edit: and he carried right before the travel 🤣🤦🏾‍♂️
Nah friga doing it all wrong it’s cool to be respectful but dude was bout to lose and started to exploit and abuse his kindness u gotta draw the line somewhere smh
He ok , but That Boy hezi left hand hella weak
These announcers make this unbearable to watch. Why these guys repeat every sentence atleast three times.  Couldn't even finish watching
Can you hear this on the next NBA2K Soundtrack  🐐GOAT WALK🐐?‼️..  https://youtu.be/eqntbKUeL8A
Travel fo sho!!!
The announcers repeating themselves over and over and over is annoying af.
Watched this jawn on 🔇
👇BEST 🏀 CONTENT‼️ https://youtu.be/gFg8xuzVtb4
I'm sorry but friga ruining hezigod momentum with that travel call.. I know hezi can be a good sport but deep inside he know friga played with that travel call.
Somebody had to shut her up jajajaja
Hezi WEAK!!!!!!!!
Hezi stay taking L”s took another one after this lol
This is absolute genius.
3rd time watching this! Good stuff!
MUST SEE is Friga vs Showtime... that'a a guard version of Duncan vs KG
Hezi needed to lose shooting all those bricks over easy layups smdh.
Both players are terrible shooters . This one on one exposed them very badly .
.THE MASKS ARE MANDATED SO THAT PEDOS CAN BE OUT AND ABOUT WITH THEIR UNDERAGE BOYFRIENDS OR GIRLFRIENDS.
Get me in there 1v1 abcgi
Why is his name Hezi God i don't see it in his game.he his no jumper
Could do without the children commentary.
My white girl in the black jersey cheering for the guy in the white jersey 🤔
Oh shit Deemazing lol
Hesi walked. He never gathered so he only gets 2 steps
20:00
I'm winning against both these guys sign me up.  And hezi handles suspect
Frig won this game hands down. After the travel and score. Frigga should of had the ball. Hezi carries and doubles all the time
Hesitate traveled all the way with that one.
27:45 he traveled after the step back
Lol I say it all the time. I love that Tyreke Evans handle, but fuck that off arm. I can never respect anyone that does that. Someone as good as Hezi should not have to use that off arm to create separation on his drives. When did the off arm become acceptable??? Back then if anyone ever did that, he got clowned.
Good game but Friga should’ve and could’ve beennnn ended it
Your commentary is lit
Hezi traveled lol..
Ok ok
fouls frigga in game 2, doesnt give him the ball. travels clearly in game 3, gets loud and obnoxious. this is the 24 hour fitness version of lance stevenson. and if you notice, announcers KNEW it was a travel but didnt "want to get involved". right. they woulda got involved if the roles were reversed 100%. tribalism
Hezi a one hand bandit !!! If he ain’t going right he pulling back for a jumper.
Friga is pure class.., Real hooper and great attitude..,Fk those so called villains or bad boys they all cant get near what Friga is doing..,
Nice game!👏🔥
Who was that baddie
which shoes was Hezi wearing?
They need to rule out the step back jumper from these 1-1s
Broadcasters are horrid lmaoooooooooooooo
Its funny no one was posting up . . .
Anyone know what shoes hezi had on this game?
Friga too damn nice giving him ball like that.
Hezi travelled
The hell @destroying doing there 😂
Hezi traveled his ass off
When we gone see T jazz and friga
Blatant travel!!!
🗣🥱🥱🥱😲
Gd 1 v 1 but I don’t think saw one left handed finish the whole time
Hezi TRASH once again losing to a true hooper lmfao
He Traveled In The 3rd Round
This y I dnt lik hezi
Nigga ran to the crib on gawd talm bout it’s a bucket 😂😂
Hezi really 0-2 😂😂😂
CheatGod/PushoffGod/TravelGod/FoulGod just wasn’t enough
bro im not gon lie i didnt realize marcelas was so short lmaoooo
Where the other games?
Blah blah blah until I heard "I block negativity" rewind and watch video again. I like that bro. 👌
Hg cry to much🤣 glad you bussed his ass
bruh im sweatin
Cel and Dev got the same eyes and nose low-key lol
hezi honestly reminds me of cardi b just cuz he talks loud he thinks he right lmao hezi has that napoleon complex
Both are number 1 hoopers.  I think Hezi got bad luck on shots but good game.   I like Hezi attacking the Basket put more entertaint to the game.   Respect to Friga on last foul passing of it
Horrible shot selection by both.
Anyone else notice the travel on hezigod when he had friga jumping with the pump fake?
Play it back in .25 speed and you know he traveled. He took 4 steps but gg
Hezi"god": dribble, dribble, dribble, carry, dribble, dribble, carry, travel...
Hezi debo'd them few calls at the end. Hell of a game
Hezi all the way 💯 https://youtu.be/NPe9moXRjqI
This is controvereSEAIAL
hezifoul？ hezifkin foul？ chears on most play wut a loser
Friga kill him... He was playing rude.. N foul.
You should play this game with and 1 baby shack
30:12 controversial lol
29:15 not only did he travel, he carried too lmao
these announcers sound like they feel some type of way about Hezi
jeeez what a  good run.. great 1v1
Anyone peep @deestroying?
hahaha MFers brought out the swifer, and the broom for the sweat, and this how you play a 1v1, straight up, win or  lose we friends just competing making each other better. Unlike when "i forgot who the two were that played 1v1" one way syaing he should of won cuz he 6"8 ... either way they took it too serious started arguing after, beefing all over a 1v1 He travels hard at the end there, talking "Its a bucket" bro when playing basketball that much you know when you travel because of muscle memory, you can always tell when you took that extra step and he knew, cuz when homie said you swear on basketball gods, he didnt answer just shot for it. he knew he traveled hard AF. Then "no foul i just jumped with him" yea you just jumped INTO HIM Friga won because he was suppose to, after the bullshit travel, and foul, destiny made sure it ended up the way it was suppose to.
Weak.... why they need unlimited dribbles
Jack and Druski needa be here lol
Sit on the right hand who tf coaches defense and reading you opponent these days
Basketball needed this one ☝️… W for the hoop world #bringthisback
Hezi fouled and traveled and friga still gave it to him
love this video dev!
frigga won twice
that was a 4 step traavel yall bitches are weak for not calling it... He LOST
These boys is trashb
If they play 💯 times it'd be 50 50
The defense horrendous
I watched it with no sound
Not hating but the commentary is pretty annoying
Been waiting for this for forever
Did I see deestroying
Enjoyed this. Both can hoop. Friga game more mature and he’s the better shooter. Hesi got nice handles although kind of wild and carry a bit. Hesi defense is trash though and when he try to play defense, he foul. He need to work on his defense straight up. Slow on his feet. There’s workouts to get better at that. I kinda feel like Friga took his foot off his neck and let him live till the end out of respect and being a nice dude😂. That’s how the overall momentum felt of the series.   Overall good game.
Yo I like this… this dope! Basketball done changed but the change workable. Make me want to hoop again. This force ppl to play defense or look silly
Hezi is a chump, you can tell by the way he plays.
Man, great series! I'm not a hater but I love to see Hezi lose. Clearly a travel on his end.. Been following you for a few years Friga, good finish bro
mad travel lol
Chewks vs friga.
I hope Bone, Slim, TJazz, and Professor is there.
and they on hezi meat nikka don't even do nun crowd be like oooh like go head🤣
hezi god garb fridge gave em leeway like sH%t
Cool game. But the first one with Dev vs. Friga I paid the cash because you guys said it wouldn’t be on YouTube at all and the next day it’s on YouTube. I subscribe to both. But tht was foul.
Dis is real 🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏁🏁🏁
Hell naw dat shit was friga ball hezi traveled like a mffffffffffffffff
Ball don’t lie
Charlotte breed the best in everything
Where's the mid range...nobody like midrange but all great scorer relied on mid range..
My anxiety: 📈📈📈📈
Friga im sorry to say your a beast at basketball but man just finish the game rather then trying to look saucy
Hezi really has a raw handle
Friga toooo nice
Great set up, you should do a best 5 group next year oh and invite tjass
OMG, this Hezi dude with all these fouls...Still took the L
People might say I’m stupid but I feel like hezi isn’t that good
He walked his ass off
Hezi wack for that shit at the end 🤦‍♂️, anyways a lot of these youtubers ain’t playing real basketball
Hezi you traveled bro Friga good shot for game, that was very entertaining good basketball, that might have been the best basketball I've seen on YouTube both guys can play. 🏀👍
watching the carry god take that L was so satisfying to watch!
Am I the only one that's going to say this? That last play by Hezi was CLEAN. No travel.  Once he controls the ball with his right hand (so when his hand comes under the ball) = 0 step or gather step  He does a perfect 1-2 after this. Watch it again, slow it down. It's clean.
Friga was destined to win the moment hezi traveled and fouled him in the end
that was a Travel
Hezi god defense exposed
Lost allot of respect for hezi god after watching this. Friga was ballin though
What about offensive rebounds. Take back everything. Don't stop the game
Dope. Wonderin why Chris Staples was rootin for Hezi when Dvontay was on HIS squad... 🤔 are they homies orrrrr?
No cap this bout to be my 3rd time watching
I need more of this... !!!!!!!!!
Broooo this is soooooooo dopeeeeee
These guys fucking suck. If someone gave me that many open 3’s it would be over QUICK
correct me if im wrong but at 27:51 hezi god traveled after the pump fake
Friga is more skilled... Hezi just get away with stuff
Great games. Thank you Dev! Friga lot of respect for explaining the no call and I agree. How you call shouldnt be based on the score. Hezi your drive to the right is pretty dope in 1v1. Kinda wish every game was to 11 by 1 & 2 but the change did make for a cool game 3. Lot of love on keeping it very competitive but showing the friendship too. I like seeing that.
at last friga "the humbleman" won with respect
Good game. Good shit!
Wish you could watch this without the commentary... one guys says something and the second guy repeats it 2 more times, stupid and annoying
Bruuuhhhhhh, they did not disappoint!!! Hats off to everyone in the Creator Classic 🔥🙏🏼
How many times Friga gonna call game before he makes the shot dear god.
Great game, but when you get fouled you do you get the ball back? Wha
Bull shit at the end
Wow
Friga such a good dude
Ima say it, Friga BETTER be smashing Jenna See how she cheerin for him
Friga do dis.
Now this was a good game   Hezi was hacking like crazy and friga just kept it moving
Hezi a Que?
hesi picks up his dribble, then wants to complain about the ball. What a chump.
Hezigod has horrible shooting mechanics, he never sets his feet and his back foot barely plants a lot of times. His body doesn't align with the rim either, he really shoots like a street baller.
That's a bucket bro, nah that was a half mile walk
They should drive more
Epic game 🔥🔥🔥 Hezi Travelled like there was no covid mandates
hezigod loses in 1 vs 1 cause he's all offense
Jesus loves you e
“ Ain’t got no body to blame but himself “ hahahaha 😩
Hezi got all the excuses and free passes with all his violations yet Friga still won. Deal with that.
If I watched it live or didn’t know who won it would have been super intense. Was still fun to watch these ballers battle.
This was the fanciest 1v1 game ever
Good sportsmanship gd game 🤞🏾💪🏾✅
This ain't my battle this ain't my battle but says whoever makes it first trying to be on hesi side and he still took a L dev in the lab literally tried his best to sell this wack ass event 🤣😂
The Cream Rose to the top on that one!!!   WTG Friga   and I think Hezi stil walking... I clocked him over in the middle of Iceland Somewhere....🏃🏾🗻🧭🗺
Friga gets way to comfortable gotta learn how to finish when you only need a layup or mid range and gotta call foul that’s bs
Friga shot on point but gotta stop relying on it so much and work on the mid range and drive more
Friga is tuff
It's tough watching friga cause so many mf's try to take advantage of him cause they know he's a good guy i.e. briz, cash and now hezi.
Hezi carried AND travelled and they almost let him get away with it smh great game though this was fun to watch
Hezi is dope but he be carrying like no other lol
TRAVEL!
Algum br ?
Hezi mad asf he lost 😂
Hezi don’t ever know how to loose
Great great battle but I feel as size with friga should of been exposed more he settled with more 3 pointers the 3rd game . But great battle overall
When they both gasped @23:31 😂😂😂
wack ass game
🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑
enough 🧱🧱🧱 to build a house
these guys are trash. I'll beat them both  easy
Friga could have had that much easier but chose not to use his size.
Good game but Hezi travel a lot. He still a good player tho.
I appreciate the replay OG
good shit. hezi went on a vacation tho😭
I'd mess both these fools up! (in thumb wrestling)
I wanted to friga to win too! ✊🏽💪🏽🙏🏽👏🏽 That was great game and in that big possession, hezi did Travel 🧳
Hezigod is good but I think he’s pretty mid honestly he’s just flashy often but as far as a actual player I don’t think he’s as good as niggas be saying😂
My guy took 4 whole steps
Friga is tooo nice fam. It’s ok to be like that in regular life but Your hooping🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
And Jenna Bandy was in the building!!!!
🔥🔥🔥
🤦🏾‍♂️hezi is pure trash 🗑, and by the way these 1v1 games are trash all together, this version is only offense practice , rebounding is a part of the game and defense but is completely left out
how'd I know hesi would blow it. why are these guys so mentally weak
Let’s goooo frigaaaaa
why they using a swiffer to dry up the wet spots lmfao
We play there every Tuesday night
Good ass game but y’all need to speak up 🆙 when there controversial moments man
Big travel at the end but it’s aight
All Great games keep it up
this man hesi god carries atleast twice a play
bro it’s pronounced “Freega” 💀
Friga is just a better player he doesnt have to cheat and act a foul like hezi
Best 1v1 of the last 5 years
Always got the camera on dee😂
Hezi God cry baby
He can better change his name to 'The Carrygod' damn.
To this day hezi still walking
A lot of dribbling for 1 on 1s ….. 3 dribble max fellas
Hezi is a hack on defense and offense. He does a lot of pushing off when he dribbles. Very good ballers though. Especially Friga
HeZi can’t shoot . Friga can’t do anything but shoot
Travel
Hezi B. god
dont like the fact that they do not have to hustle for the rebound after missed shots....it's like I get ONE shot if I miss it well it your ball now...nvr seen a 1 v 1 played like that...
For the people…
That game was a GAME!!!!!
Friga the better player 10 outa 10 times
Hezi just fouled every time he got beat
It’s crazy when you think about how far Dev came. I could literally remember watching his ball handling videos as a little kid. Hard work definitely pays off
Cmon why Hezi cheating like that lmao. I’m glad he lost. Nothin but humbleness from Frigga, letting the game speak for him
WAS NOT A TRAVEL
Friga needs an arm sleeve, some wrist bands or something. He looks like a generic 2k create a player.
Commentators seem a bit bias.  They should be counting 2s. Hezi carrying the ball like a newborn.
What’s your pc spec??
Dawg carry the ball like no one ever before 😂😂
Fuck outta here talking about “that’s a bucket!!”  U travel boii
Really good game, damn!
Devin “Kenny Smith” Lab
Hezi God is running the ball hahaha
Friga too nice that was clearly a travel but good games though #BIL
Friga and Hezigod need to 2 v 2 somebody. Talking solid teamwork. Fanz in the building.
True colors come out at the end.  Friga integrity 100%
Hezi lost cause dude doesn't play defense to afraid of getting his ankles took but they both great players with good jumpshots
Great game. Hezi traveled. Friga was the better shooter. It was a toss-up between these 2.
With all these 1v1's is there anyway we can get a 1v1 Tournament? You could have Friga and Hezi to be the #1 seeds on either side. Another Idea get 2 Youtuber Captians and do a Live Stream Draft for a Creators Allstar Game 5v5.
Hezi keep fouling heavy bogus calls 😪  Friga too nice. All that cheating and bs just to lose while dancing lmaooo
Yoooooooo...... YALL GOTTA RUN THIS ONE BACK!!! And..... 🗣WHY ARE THESE TWO MEN NOT IN THE NBA??? 🗣AT LEAST THE G League!!!  🗣NBA SCOUTS..... I know DAMN WELL YALL SEE HOW FAR BOTH OF THESE TWO GUYS HAVE CAME!! It’s time for them to get an INVITE FOR A FEW NBA TEAMS or G LEAGUE TEAMS!! Invite THESE GUYS ASAP!!! Great GAME GUYS!!
That’s why FRIGA won.... Because Hezi (I fool with you) is a bully! He wants ALLLL his calls!! FRIGA GAVE HIM 3 chances to win... THEN THE BASKETBALL GODS SAID....”Hezi...🗣TAKE THIS “L” 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🗣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🗣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🗣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🗣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
🗣 FRIGA DOES NOT CALL FOULS... 🗣Hezi WANTS ALLL OF HIS!!🤷🏾‍♂️
why arent they releasing it different adn more organized. looked fro more episodes and its so hard to find the creatore classic
hezi is overrated
I would pay for a rematch
Hell na, y’all all hoopers how y’all not gonna call out the travel.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 game
Gamed it even tho he didn’t get that obvious travel and that clear foul. If “CARRY GOD” would of won it would been real bitter. Ggs
On some I LOVE IT I MISSED OUT BUT I WONT MISS ANOTHER SALUTE #RESPECT
Got my heart racing..🗣🗣
Friega is a awesome guy
Dev shoutout to you famo with great content!
2021 force 3s even if you need a 1
This was 🔥
So damn happy the better person won.  Obviously the better player with a better shot, who also hezi'd Hezi as well as caught him reaching, but also just the person of better overall character.  Awesome
Hezi isn't "playing the villain" he's just got a bad attitude
Hezi has a bad attitude and played out repetitive moves, not a fan.
Great game but @30:19 I finally in my life seen when ball lied. Hesi traveled. Yall cheated Friga ijs
Damn can we go left sometimes 🤔
A step-back to the right for a right handed shooter isn't easy because of the need to rotate the foot placement
This was amazing 🔥🔥
Black jersey carrying every time. Friega all jumpers, challenge yourself.
We want stephanea vs lolofitzmo
Hesi always fouls on offense and defense smh
The people who did not like this video, probably do not have love for the game of basketball. Regardless of who's in the video, there was 100% heart and sweat put into this video no fake content just AWESOME. We need more ideas like this video/content.
Mannn friga too nice 😭 hesi travel and he fouled him at the end and friga just let both of them go. GG’s tho
what an event dev a godfather of this !!
It’s surprising to here hezi was thought to win
Great game and Mann I hope this becomes a yearlything
Entertaining af 🔥
Hezi god is such a cheater
Dope
friga is a demon
I dunno why this mattered so much, but I needed Friga to win that one so bad. Well done my guy
Friga is deadass the goat
Dev is Fr a real one taking care of the community plp still hating tho
Def a travel but that wasn't a foul at the end.
Keep doing u bro bump the haters
I felt that energy!! Thanks for sharing this with us !
Why Hesi not respecting this man!
NBA gotta do one on ones for allstar wkend now
Amazing one on one 💯💪🏽 ….. I love both guys styles of play . A1 players !!!!!! Need that rematch though
Wow this was great. I would say 27:50 was a travel but 29:10 was clean. 29:10 looked like too many steps but you have to start counting when he "ends" his dribble (when his hand goes under the ball).
Both these guys are the future of street ball ,top dawgs
The right guy one
Hezi grabing to much on the drives has a paddle on the off ball hand ..
I saw 5 steps
im loving this format
I have chills.
TRRRAAAAAAAVVVVVLLLLEEEEEEE!!!!!!!! FOH!!!!!!
I had to mute. These guys annoying as f u c k
Best 1v1 on You Tube!
Love it Dev!  These two are really close, skill and experience I think goes to Hezi but D has the height and youth along with potential!  Out of 100 games I say Hez wins 55 though right now.
How does he not have more subscribers
Damn that black dude on the first and second game is a hack
These 2 need actually need to team up and make vids
Man this is old shit why post this !??
Glad Friga won  All around great game except the traveling hahaha
hezi god aint even hezi he need to change his name
D won while giving hezi the edge on those foul/travel calls. Respect g
“Can we get a 3rd game”   Bro that’s literally the point of a best of 3… the dude on right commentating is a dunce lol
Great game fam... like I said many times Friga just toooooo friendly for this $hit!!! PS, "travel" lol 😆  PPS, If Hezi get his wind up it's a wrap! 😜
29:17 was a travel but fr good ass game
How u gonna stop the game because u sweat on the ball?
Bro friga is not the underdog the announcer dude don’t know shit ! He’s a D3 hooper for real hezi has been more underground type shit
Hezi is slow as shit and non-athletic.
29:11 At normal speed it looks a lot like a travel but.. if u pause it or slow it down and look at when hezi's hand goes under the ball, he only took 2 steps after. But nonetheless, amazing game!
you the man dev!
You see this lol 😂 https://youtu.be/tfqebVyYpC0
Omg I wanted to watch the game but less then 2 minutes in and I'm tired of hearing this guy voice already dam u really have to say everything like 5 times  Off the front of the rim  Off the front of the rim  Off the front of the rim  Off the front of the rim  Off the front of the rim  You can't leave him open like that You can't leave him open like that You can't leave him open like that You can't leave him open like that You can't leave him open like that
Friga a fair ass player…. Me I woulda been a grinch for the ball straight up 😂
Friga is too nice
🤐🍔
Hezi talked his way out of that last foul everybody was to sceard to say anything but friga won with respect and integrity
Friga 🔥
Friga is too nice sometimes, hezi hella fouled him and was actin like a bitch lmao i hate hoopers like that
They both can’t go left
I’m sorry but I hate how hezi acts. It’s like he’s tryin to be “humble” or something but it just looks like he has a bad attitude. Idk, maybe I don’t watch enough of him. It just looks like he has a shitty attitude about everything.
Couldn't have asked for a more entertaining game. Respect for both Friga and Hezi
Good ass game!!
We need more events. Much respect dev
Thank god you put this out for us to watch wow this is probably the best 1v1 out of the creators
hezi with the obvious travel at the end
Hezi got shawn kemp mannerism it’s not .. it don’t look good
Thought Hezi would win, Friga proved me wrong. Hezi needs to learn to take advantage of his strength.
This dude in love with hezi
Being humble got Friga the win 🥇
Gotta love trash talk during the 1s
Damn man i need thisssssss
my boy deestroying in da cut
Friga killed hezi I knew he wasn’t that good he got No Jump-Shot trash 🗑 can boy 👦 hezi . I won mad bread on Friga I told people that he was gonna beat hezi lmao 🤣
Props to both!!! That last game was the battle!!! Good stuff.
Oh yeah now that’s a 1 v 1 right there 🔥
3 steps
Prime example of goku & vegeta type shit
Chris acting like hezi wasnt talking to him lmao
I'm da king 🤴🏾 of da court
hesi guy complaining about foul , though bodying friga everytime he tried to drive. that isnt defense, nobody can scorte if u play defense fouling everytime using your body instead of feet. friga plays pretty honesty d, and doesnt use his body much liker alot of these youtubers do which is a foul
trash
Hezis black Street side came out lolol
why hezi lost "if you sag off your swags off"
Man hezi traveled bro he shouldn’t of never shot the ball
The laughable wing conceptually long because sink geographically behave given a wiry aluminium. dysfunctional, superficial pantry
Great game, travel tho.
Hezi’s point to bring it to 8-9 was Godly 😩
Travelllll !!!! Can’t play one v one with fridga and shoot with him
He’s walked the green mile and said bucket 😂😂😂
32:44 the disappointment on Hezi's face LMAOOO.. ma bad it was funny as hell no cap
This is a classic 🙌
I hate hezi lmaoo ... When he starts getting scared on he gets quite
Great games!! Game 3 100%.... TRAVEL!!  Great event!!!!!
Let’s goooooo my guy frigaaaaaa
Dawg in the black pick the ball up too shift you dont care if the side of the ball he pick up he trash
Two absolute beasts
2 rewatch. I need this.
Overhyped lots of brick
This is awesome man I'm glad this is a thing all these guys are the best on YouTube for sure
Deserved victory, but very well played.
Boring
Hesi is a great player to have to draw attention in team ball and can also catch fire but Friga is better all around in my opinion
Cheaters don’t win Mr.Hezi
How good was that?
Ball don’t lie.  #BEAST
LEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
They need to be quiet
It in fact not a travel
Now that’s what we’re missing, the actual love for the game🏀 that’s shits inspiring
Humbleness wins!!! <3
BIG TRAVEL !!! PASSPORT AND PJ !!!
Definitely a travel, Hezi took 3 steps 🤷🏻‍♂️
Hesi god not like that good work tho
Why hesi shot so many threee dawg he gotta get into friga its easy buckets
Goated
@Inthelab Really dope seeing the ones. No hate to Dev, but I feel like you could have more purposeful commentary. At times it felt like yall were just saying a lot of words for no reason just distracting from the content. Instead do that joe rogan approach when he calls fights. Break down moves for us, give us insight into why a move worked vs why it didn't. Being how experienced you guys are at training this could be an easy add to the event.
Why are they shooting these long ass ones like what’s the point get to the basket💯
these 1s were sorry smh. horrible defense and unlimited dribbles lmao. and first to make it for ball? tf? shoot for ball u make its ur ball, if not then their ball cmon now
good idea with the commentating, but everything you guys said, you guys kept repeating it. just something to work on.
“Better turn into clamp god “ 😂
Best 1v1 I've ever seen
"We homies but there aint no ties"-Great event. I love the competitive respect.
Yea dev in my 😇cash nasty voice
Love seeing Deestroying there.
He jumlnon his back talking about "what, what" lol
How is Hezi not carrying the ball???
On his hezi god head doe😭
Number 21 on the white team was trying to spit game the whole video 😂
🔥🔥🔥💪🏾😎
Nick Briz could never
Are all these content creators? Where is the professor?
Nigga said "it get real spicy in here" lol 2x   Playin dat robin role well 😂😂
Hezi looking like Harden with the three-step. Glad Friga got the W!!
That’s my guy Friga
Brooooooo this is wild lit how tf did i miss this ??????? Kicks genius played ???
these two as announcers funny asf
best 1-1 I've seen in my life!
I like this…
Great Game, FRIYGAAAA!💪🔥🔥🔥
Hezi is the biggest sigma male I've ever seen
hezigod carriers a lot 😂😂🤦🏾‍♂️ terrible
Great game
Good game. But we call admit that hezi was hacking the whole game.
friga humble and a cool dude, big props
Crazy game !! That’s content right here
White inverson always against Friga after he dropped him off
Hezi such a dam cheat lol and when he losing or afraid he don’t showboat for shit lol hahah see how quite that man was ha he was shook the whole time
Stop being so friendly frig. Once it got close I need all that 💯
saw this on Nelly's channel already, not a big fan of friga, but I don't like carrygawd, I mean... pushgawd, so Friga deserves this win
friga game is too smooth
Hezi tried to cheat a lil bit, but the basketball gods got it right.  Good job Friga.
Devin u a real one for showing us fam
@29:13 it was a travel, Hezi collected just a bit to early 🤷🏼‍♂️
Hezigod traveled his ass off
Cast Marcelas and Dev for Dodgeball 2
Game time!!!! Let’s go Friga!
I know kick genius aint PULL UP. WHERE YALL AT MANNN. COME BACK.
And you can hear a mouse peeing on cotton 😂 😂
Hezi thinks he’s to cool to play defense. Even in street pickup games. I hate that shit.
friga with skill and class
That shit was boring as hell Why keep shooting 3s and missing  Go to the hole hezi
W VIDEO
Hezi traveled y’all even called it dev he took 3 steps
Why da hell I’m in here acting like I’m there y’all need a league of y’all own man I love this more then the nba.. this match was a classic
I love this kinda energy on the court shit had me hype the whole time
Put some respect on D'vontay's fucking name...what a great match up
OHH!!! ima share this ASAP …. 🏀4Life
Travel at the end
Hezi made himself look dumb arguing those calls at the end
Hesi is average. Sf
Friga a class act
Not a travel...Should've been played on he gather the ball then did 2 STEPS! I DO THAT ALL THE TIME...not a fan of both lol but I believe hezigod took that one forsure if it wasn't called JS
Hezi be fouling he every drive and saying he didn't travel, you cannot trust this man
D friga deserved that win
this was fire
Dev gave us the 1v1 of the year hands down appreciate it
Y’all should help hezi god make a YouTube.. def needs some love !
Neither guy went left at all
Defa a travel
you gotta do that more often
Then 29:10 this nigga Hezi took 4 steps lol wtf
I always thought Friga would win but he's too nice. Make your calls and stop deferring all the time. Get a lil dawg in you and you'd be surprised how that takes your game up.
27:50 Hezi with the super travel to almost end it
This is the ultimate youtube athletics gathering in this crowd right here lol
The guy friga was playin isn’t good just streetball stuff. Carries, travel, complaining.  Friga played good legit ball and  deserved the win
Gotta love hezi. Double dribbles, fouls, walks and keeps getting the ball until he scores. It's the same thing everytime he plays. Gotta play him with a ref!      And still lost🤦‍♂️
🔥🔥 my boy hezi low key brought the yeet back
Aye ball don’t lie hesi was tryna finessseee
how is that a travel..he dribbled the ball with his right hand like normal and then as he landed on his right foot he gathered the ball by putting his hand under the ball..just like any other gather.. And then he took a two steps, first with his left and then his right?
Ryan needed to be sideline mic up too bro 😮‍💨😁😂 good sht though 💯
Sorry I didn’t get a ticket mane Preciate you for uploading this 👌🏾🖤
I didn’t watch this one yet but just looking at the beginning and reading comments, it looks like y’all took the last event criticism to heart and hit this one outta the park. Good shit 💪🏾 bought a ticket and wasn’t able towatch the last one bit definitely running the numbers up on this vid 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Hezi could of won that last game if he didn’t settle for so many 2s he really a mid range slasher at heart I feel like.
15:00 brought back memories 🔥🔥 #AND1
Needed that W. For the culture. 💪🏻 Friga’s built different. His D is tuuuuuff!
That travel at the end that almost changed the outcome
After all that happen in these games it ended exactly how it was supposed😂😂 in the words of Dev “ Ball Game”
No T jazz
Hezi taking too many jumpers, that leg must not be %100
Was hezigod leg hurt or something
THIS is what I like to SEEEEE
30:50 im ngl OG that shouldn't have been no travel OG... that was fasho a bucket, meaning the next take would've been game.... but whatever y'all say, OG...
Friga FTW!!!
The guy in black fouled friga a lot
Game time first round 🔥🔥
When is the next 10000 hours ?
Hezi needs to seriously work on that defense. Good offense is obviously not good defense against a sharp shooter lol
Respect to Friga for actually playing defense. At one point he was guarding Hezi from half court
Hezigod has no defense straight offense.
This dude hezi wrist carries too damn much
Love it!
Hezi is amazing lol but Friga can just shoot over him with that height advantage. Height is everything in 1v1. Plus friga deserved to win cus that was def a travel
Noice!
Hezi carries a lot
Amazing game Hezi was gassed by end of second game. 😔
When Friga stripped the ball, he was out of bounds when he caught it. .25 Speed. Hezi travelled. 2 bad calls. Friga should have man'd up and called his out. Every possession counts. Every possession decides the game.
29:15 was a double travel!!  Lol
Friga deserved that. Twice on the 10/10 on the third game he given Hezi the ball. Hezi clearly travelled but he let him go for shot for shot for the position and Hezi clearly fouled him but he also gave the position to Hezi. Both had a good game. Grats to both.
Amazing, boyz
👍👍👍💪💪💪
When buddy the announcer gets up and keeps telling them to come here for the mid game interview , only to ask THEM The series format of the game . 😂😂
Announcers trash af good game tho
19:19 WTF! was not expecting Deestroying to make a cameo <3
yooooo thank you for posting this!!
Not going to lie slow down that travel call on hezi and u see he gathers and takes 2 steps. People say hezi was cheating but he actually won. Good game tho that dagger was crazy
I love it when the overconfident, arrogant pendejo gets the L
Good game but they was 🍆🚴🏿‍♂️ hezigod
Give hezi his rematxh bakk and it was a good game 2 see no kap💯
Everybody : 😳 Dev: This is con-tro-verse-sea-ull!
I’m glad Friga won this matchup. Hezi be loud and wrong 😂😂
HEZI CHEATER
Hezi God overrated
This was better than lebrons 3-1 comeback against the warriors 🔥🔥🔥 good session
Hezi only good against people who don’t really play ball
Great content. Hezi gotta put that hand up 🙋‍♂️ next time
aye dev right on for the vid def copping a ticket next year 🙌🏾🙌🏾
Hezigod didn’t respect Friga’s shot and played some bum ass street ball defense.  Great event. Would love to see more of this content.

Obviously a 3 step travel
Hezi God another travel 🤏🏽 (27:50)
Boy hezi did travel tho😂put that playback speed to .25 and it’s clear as day
that move hezzi did at 5:14 was kinda different
This was 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Hezi is a werido for going to half court in this second game !!
Hezi God Traveled! 3 steps! Friga still one after he cheated! Lmao good try though hezi 😭😂
29:10 not only is that a travel he carried before he traveled…. Put video in slow-mo you will see. Good beats Evil

Where is Nick Briz at??
Travel
Bro Hezi out there cheesing around the rules, he foulin
What great art showcased here! Shoutout Dev!  For always being creative and looking to take things to the next level. Shoutout Kick Genius, Shoutout Friga & Hezi for an insane 1 v 1. Long time basketball YouTube supporter! This was 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
#InstantClassic
Hezi was playing with ego. Not playing defense til it was too late
I'm sorry, HE CARRIES EVERYTHING.
he traveled
Been watching Dev since his Afro day, and the dribble on beat challenge !!
Salute to Friga
Friga almost let em take it from em
Ball game
Some serious Hezi D riding in the lab 👀 Friga was amazing. I thought Hezi would have taken this. One for the ages. 👍
9:54 they acted like hesigod didn’t just hack Friga and Friga checked up 🤷‍♂️
No way hesi watches this video and still believe he did not travel…. DUDE Almost took 4 steps😂😂😂
Hesi do not play defense 🤦🏽‍♂️
Nahh Friga definitely tried stacking his team when he was in SA. He picked up EVERYBODY that could dunk and still lost EVERY game. 😅🤷🏽‍♂️
I ain’t gonna lie I’m a big supporter and all and still am, but I would’ve never bought the creator classic if I knew y’all were gonna drop the games on YouTube 🤦🏽‍♂️
LETS FUC******* GOOOOO!!!!! GIVE FRIGA HIS DANM CREDIT WHEN ITS DUE!😤😤😤
The tough tony antics really get you invested. Great content.
Lol these two dudes…commentating. Hilarious 😂
Putting out this one v one will get y’all more sales in future years. I’d say to keep this format of releasing the “big game” to the public!  Also have a paid re-release 30 days after the original. 35% of original cost. Go up and down on that percentage and you’ll find the right number. After a couple releases you flip and your selling the big game and only publicly release a quality game, but lower on the card!
Big walks!
cel looks like dev’s son
Thanx a lot for posting it. I hope to be a part of next year’s Creator Classic
This video should be in the millions!!!
Traaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaavel
Bro 🔥🔥🔥all I have to say love the content I put out bro can’t wait to see more of the 1v1
Travel!!!
Dev acts like every move they got from him 😐 sit cho —
Marcela’s is annoying to hear on the mic. I’m sorry 😬
This is beautiful 🥺💯🏀
They not even playing defense tho  Great platform
White guyverson so corny
this has a lil wimbledon feeling to it.. like its a tennis match and the score is 7-6 advantage Friga
I seen Uncle Skoob lock Hezi God up I knew he was gonna lose he really ain’t shyt without that pick n roll 😂😂😂 good player but over hyped for sure
Hesi got killed by Friga, if both games were 1’s and 2’s and the score was cumulative with quarters , hezi wouldn’t stood no chance 😂
we’re my content creator uncle skobb !!
SUPER tuff game
3:23 Smokey Smokey😭
18:30 😂😂😂😂
is that a zotac 3080? I have 4 of those, they are my best running cards
I gained respect for hezi 1000%
hezi is out of shape and had a bad shooting day and still lost by a bucket i still respect that loss, and friga exposed the lack of defense he was playing kncking down those shots. But my money is on Hezi if they play again i dont think hell miss that much again
I could beat most of these dudes 1v1....https://youtu.be/uda1w9561VM
Crazy !
Friga's been putting in work. He deserved that W!
Hezi & Friga vs K showtime & MK
Just that genuine message made me sub we need more creators like you
For the record: I am not a Bible scholar, and have no formal training in any way. In fact, I am a High School dropout and have never taken a college course or any theology classes. I’ve never read a ‘Commentary’ on any Scripture, I can’t read Hebrew, Greek or any language other than English.  I say all that to say this: If you glean anything from what I'm about to say you need to know it is from the Living God. Not me. The confidence I have in His word comes from Him. The faith that I have in His ability to transform and redeem lives comes from Him and from personal experience. The knowledge I have of the Living God (the God of the Bible) comes from knowing Him and His inspired word, and my understanding of it comes from the indwelling of His Holy Spirit. I do not proclaim to know all that there is to know about the Lord, but what I do know I am grateful to have the opportunity to share with you. The Lord gave me LIFE when I was living in the deepest darkness…with no hope…or a future… and I am here because I was not alone in that darkness and I want YOU to know the God that saves. [If you don’t already] . And If you do, then I pray you will join me in my quest to bring God’s glorious light into the darkness that is consuming our world. Not for my sake…but for the sake of those who are still lost. Join me in crying, “Come to the cross of Jesus! He is MIGHTY TO SAVE!”  You need to know that there is irrefutable evidence that God’s word was written by One who knows the end from the beginning, so don’t believe the lie that all believers in Him have a ‘blind’ faith that is based on ‘feelings’, and nothing more. Many of us came to Christ with blind faith [with little to no knowledge of God], but if we’re growing in our relationship with Him and the knowledge of His word we will grow into a mature Christian that cannot be swayed by false teachers, mockers, or staunch unbelievers, for how can we deny one we KNOW? And how can we not defend the One who has redeemed us, transformed us, and given us eternal life?  I am not still following Christ with blind faith…but am, rather, walking towards heaven with my eyes wide open…confident in the God I serve……………and I just want to make my Heavenly Father proud.  The word of God says that we have all sinned. All of us. And sins penalty is death. The good news of the Bible is that God loves us so much He didn’t want us to have to pay the penalty for our sins so He paid the penalty for us! He literally died for us…so we wouldn’t have to! And because he’s God he rose from the dead to prove that He was who He told everyone He was…and, [His word tells us] to prove that He was successful in doing what He came to do. To pay the penalty of our sin in full.  So does that mean that everyone gets to go to heaven now? No. Everyone could….but everyone won’t. Because not everyone is grateful that Jesus died for them. And some people don’t even feel guilty for their sin. They like sinning. And for that reason they will reject Jesus. Some people just don’t believe in Jesus. Some are so crazy they don’t even believe He ever even existed, even though there’s irrefutable evidence and proof that He did. And others think they’re pretty good people…and think they can earn their way to heaven because of that goodness. The problem is they’re comparing themselves to other people. People who are worse than them of course. And we don’t get to go to heaven because we’re “better than our neighbors.” No sin can enter heaven. None. Period. And bottom line is only those who have repented of their sins…asked Jesus to forgive them for their sins…believed that He died for their sins…and asked Him to save them…will go to heaven. God made heaven. It belongs to Him. And He is the One who gets to decide who can go there, and who can’t. He has made a way for all of us to be able to go to heaven…but many people are so arrogant they think they can do it “there way” and still get there. :( They’re wrong.  To repent means to not only admit you have sinned…but to be truly sorry in your heart for sinning as well. [Not sorry because you got caught…but sorry that you ever did it…there’s a big difference.] Repentance is the key ingredient to salvation that many people overlook. They think they can just pray a prayer…like it’s magic or something…and be saved. But that is not the case. Repentance is a requirement because God only forgives those who are sincerely sorry for what they have done. Just saying “I’m sorry” is not good enough…it’s all about what’s in our hearts.  Think of it this way. Do you have any siblings? Or cousins? Or someone in your life that’s done something to hurt you…that then had your mom or dad or someone tell them to apologize to you for what they did? And then they looked at you and said, “Sorry,” in such a way that it was obvious they were not sorry and were only saying “sorry” because someone in authority over them was making them do it? That is the opposite of “repentance.” It’s only words. It meant nothing because they didn’t mean it and they wouldn’t have even said it if they hadn’t been made to. Now, if you can tell the difference between when someone is truly sorry, and when they’re just saying “words” how much more can God…who knows everything! Our every thought! Our every deed! If we’re not truly sorry…we will not be forgiven. But, if we are truly sorry…and we ask Him to forgive us…He will do it! Immediately. And when we do that…and we believe that He paid the penalty for that sin…and all of our sin…and ask Him to save us…He will do it. Immediately. It’s all about what’s in our heart. Being sincere.  And, if you don’t know Jesus yet, then today you can ask Him to forgive you for your sins…[but only if you mean it]…and you can repent of them…tell Him you don’t want to keep sinning and you need His help to change…and put your faith in what Jesus did for you on the cross…paying your sin debt in full. The choice is yours, the Lord has given you a free will…and He loves you so very much. But He will never force you to love Him in return.  We are, right now, very late in the Biblical “end days”…and the return of Christ for his church prior to the start of the tribulation that will follow is “at the door,” so I hope you’ll consider what God’s word has to say about the days we’re living in and those that are soon coming, because although people can still place their faith in Christ after the rapture they will then lose their lives as a result of their newfound faith as the Antichrist will have no tolerance for those who choose Christ over him. Only 1/3 of those who enter the tribulation will still be alive at the end of those 7 years. The horror of it is, quite simply, incomprehensible. :( If you don’t yet know Christ…please…please don’t wait. Today is the day of salvation. Jesus desires for all to be saved…for none to perish, and we know from His word that is why He has tarried in these end days before coming! But…He will come…soon…because He is the God of His word…and if He said it…He must bring it to pass.  If you’re interested in knowing what’s going on I can tell you with 100% certainty what is happening in our world. Why it’s happening. And what’s coming next.  You see, 2000 years ago [and more] we were told by Daniel, Ezekiel, Isaiah, Matthew, Luke, John, Paul, and Peter among others [inspired by God], what would happen in “our” generation! The “end day” generation…  Why our generation? Because…for reasons only God knows…He himself predetermined that He would fulfill His “end day” prophecies during our lifetime. And so, as He inspired those who loved and served Him to write His word He gave us precise signs and “prophecies” that would be fulfilled in our generation, so that, we would “know that He is God.” In fact, the word of God prophesied a great many details about the days we’re living in. More than most even realize!  One of the most important keys to interpreting Bible prophecy is to remember that it revolves around God…Israel…and Israel’s Messiah…Jesus Christ. I see many making the mistake of trying to “interpret the prophecies” by the “signs”, rather than “interpreting the signs” by the “prophecies”. I didn’t really think about that until I responded to a comment I received from a man who believes we are already in the “tribulation” prophesied in Revelation 6–18. He is making that exact mistake which is terribly heartbreaking. He’s seeing “signs” and then is looking for “prophecies” to match them. In doing so he is misinterpreting Bible prophecy. And, as a result, [in his own words], he’s living in daily torment as he sincerely believes many have been deceived and have unwittingly received the “mark of the beast”, [which seals the eternal fate—to hell— of those who receive it] from Revelation 13 [which has not yet been implemented]. I don’t know if he is telling individuals that they now have no chance of being saved, [referring to those in some countries, who are already using a monetary system that involves them being “scanned” in some way, with a chip in their body, but the implications are horrific if he is!] Telling people that they are now condemned to hell, when in fact they are NOT… and telling them they have received a “mark” that isn’t even yet the “mark” of Revelation 13 is…well…just unimaginable. :(;
Friga vs MK
Dev is who I take advice from I could sit here and watch highlights and reactions all day wit dev he got some fire anime posters to
.. that was a frikin Shaqtn’-a-Fool travel..
These 2 vs other basketball youtubers
24:26 Hezi was like "that's why I don't play defense"
Great event Guys & congrats to the winners
Why do the commentators repeat themselves?????? Shits lame make your comment and move on. No need to keep repeating the same thing we heard it the first time
Shout out to friga man humble asf
The commentators are lame
Yea this was Dope to see. Dev put out a banger and didn't have to. Love.
cel is the funniest man
15 minutes in. This is crazy. Event of the Year by far. Glad The Creator Classic was put together and put out. 🔥
These 1s cool but nothing like the ones Dev used to have with the young bulls back in the day especially Dulani but HEZI God didn’t play no D to he had his hand down on half the shots he was just moving his feet.
This was a Great Game
Ight we got it he traveled but can we notice that crazy step back at 24:40
Love the main event
Now we need Bdot vs Filayyy
Friga is so humble on an off the court and also fair. Despite who won this game, I respect both of yous. My 2 fav youtubers foreals 💯
Yo this is soo dope
This was amazing love both of these players damn this is crazy Friga came a long way from ones against college players to playing in the Lab and Hesi God came a long way from being a hidden talent to becoming a legend in the lab . Big up to Dev for making this happen on the biggest scale possible. This was worth the wait and anticipation. The touch was passed Friga don’t gotta do park runs and Hesi don’t got nothing to prove . God Bless You All !
Commentators mad annoying
🍿🍿
Keep doing your thing family.... appreciate you doing these when you didn't have to... blessed king 👑👑👑
Friga pure honesty thats what I roll with "We didnt call the other ones!"
Nothing about the other guys character is likeable. Friga is a fresh breathe of air in this place because he's actually respectful.
She definitely looks like a Jennifer lol
So glad hezi got busted sounded awfully quiet😂
Had my stomach turning 🤣🤣
If Hezi could go left, this would have been over a long time ago. Friga is nice, though. Nice guy, nice game. If he can shoot at a higher percentage, scary.. For the record, Hezi traveled.
Hezi talented but GAWD he annoys me!!
💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼
Dev the goat ✊🏽💯
🤯🤯🤯🤯🔥🔥🔥
Commentary was 💩
dev be talking about friga new to the moments like he ain’t play D3 basketball
Mann, this was crazy. Close intense games and hezi could've put Friga away multiple times. Can't wait to see what the creator classic becomes in the future 🔥💯.
FRIGA ALL DAY🔥🔥
Anyone else think 27:51 was also a travel?
It's great to see that real skill and humbleness wins over whatever Hezi was doing. Hezi would be much more likeable if he would stop putting on an act and really stop with that travel sh**t........
Damn this my 3rd time watching this. Friday night was a movie! Great fucking event and $10 well spent. 3v3 or 5v5 elimination tourney for next event. Hezi brings a squad, Friga, Chris, Ball is life East, West, Midwest, South, etc.
Dev in the lab was low key going for hezi.. lol
I’m buying tickets to the next creator classic. This is amazing. Cant wait to see the future of this
Friga came with a tattoo and I'm nervous now!
Dev was like travel!  🤣 he saw that shit before friga called it
Freeeeeggaaaaaaa!!!
I respect Friga entirely for not calling a foul at 10-10 on his drive , or really the whole game . This was a great game but it definitely could’ve been quicker if they were on fire with their jump shot or went to the rack instead of constantly shooting 3s . Awesome game tho they both 🔥
Bruv after watching Nick Briz.. this is like a breath of fresh air!
So glad D won Hezi tried to cheat at the end
Appreciate the vid
When is the film session breakdown?
Best content ever. Hesi turn them gamebreakers on 14:37
Hezi stayed fouling smh that not standing him up
*Hey, to you reading* .... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
Ngl I was rooting for hezi god but after watching seeing friga sportsmanship I glad he won to. This vides didnt really prove who was better it could of went both ways hezi kept leaving him open at the 3 point line😭
Basketball at it's finest, with class!
Yeah it was a travel. 4 steps
Cheated and lost what a clown
Commentary is so fresh I love y’all
I ddnt get y Hezi wasn't playin Dee at 1st..... its possessions, it's not like there's a rebound to get after the shot
This is respect Dev, appreciate you for posting this video. I wanted to see it so bad but wasn't able to get it. Thanks again, I'm a big fan and appreciate all that you all are doing for basketball 💯
heart was dropping everytime they shot the ball😭 to win it bro💯
Man I gotta get into this 1 day
Fuckin fire bro, Hezi cheating like crazy. Friga got class and heart, glad he won.
Friga big enough for the league, he need a better agent.
Yal gotta do a 3 on 3 tournament
This was lit
This content was do dam good I comment two times 🙏
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯
annoying, garbage commentary by the guy on the left
That was some entertainment. That's basketball!!! I am a fan of both,but I honestly thought hezi would get the win. Awesome back and forth games, great basketball and a great portrayal of their hard work on the courts.
They call him Devonta Frieza because he is a cold killer. Lol
Bro Cel is hilarious
Friga looks almost guilty for winning
29:07 boy took like 4 steps lol
No post up game whatsoever from Friga, as if bigmen forgot how to play basketball, he would eat him with a classic post up game
Lesssss goooo
Man that shit was entertaining!!!
“For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.” John 3:16
Hezi tried to cheat!!!
That’s a big time travel
That game 3 tho 🔥
Ain’t no way hezi wasn’t putting a hand up 😭😭🤦🏽🤦🏽🤦🏽🤦🏽
This was 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Dev wanna be relevant so bad.
why hezi always has a look on his face like he has a problem with everything going on around him lol
lit
Dev thank you for this!!! Beyond amazing this was played and it had me at the edge of my seat from jump till finish 💪🏼. Respect to both Friga and Hezi ✊🏻 love watching both of these guys play.
Lmao, Hezi looked like he was bout to cry at the end. Ball don’t lie 🤷‍♂️
Ball don’t lie!
THAT WAS A TRAVEL!!!
This was litttt
When did people start playing half court with winners out?  I thought it was a universal rule that it's supposed to always be losers out after every score.  That way everyone is forced to play defense in almost every possession.  Who changed the universal rules and when and why?
Friga hit that shot I started clapping my hands like I was there
Dev the lab is a goat
I don’t like hezi anymore lmfao a damn cheater, that’s what happens when u try to cheat U LOSE
🌸If you’re reading this … I wish you  JOY, PEACE, WEALTH, and DIVINITY  x 1,000,000 in every area of your life!🌸🌸 desejo-te divindade 🌸🌸 Ich wünsche dir Göttlichkeit 🌸🌸 te deseo divinidad 🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸
The good guy won.
Very dope match 🦾🦾🦾 Friga deserved this!
Man was sweating crazy and fri was just going thru the motions 😂
Hezi god traveled from America to Europe lol
Friga got so many free points off of Hezi's unwillingness to put a hand up, and well that's the price he paid. Good game still.
Been watching Friga for years and HeziGod for about 2 now. I've wanted this 1v1 for a long time
From both player’s intensity, to their respect for each other, the crowd reactions, and especially Dev & Cel’s energy while commentating, this 1v1 and overall event was extremely entertaining. Big ups for this masterpiece! 🤙
Hezi really tried to cheat and still lost💀💀💀💀💀I’m so happy friga won cuz hezi was trynna take advantage of friga’s nice guy personality
Is that destroying on the sideline ?
hezi tried to cheat and still lost
Hezi is kinda mental. It seemed like he refused to play defense sometimes just to show that he wasn’t trying that hard. The height disadvantage definitely bothered him.
This matchup 🐐
They settled for so many outside shots, it was hard to watch. Both guys played good D on the drives, but they can't jus let shooters shoot open shots. Both players need to work on their left hand ASAP.
29:12 hesi took 3 steps but this was a crazy game !!! Saluteee
This went crazy!!!!
Was that destroying in the crowd
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb1VtabLdO0   Pure Vibe And Truth
Friga, I was ready to smack you for every basket that was yours bro. You being a little too nice my guy. Y’all both talent. But Friga you earned every basket honestly.  Shoutout to Hezi but Friga my guy tho 💪🏽💪🏽 … humble with awesome talent.. he had to work for those basket layups because he not as explosive. Tuff tho. Real tuff 💪🏽
in the lab needs a league this is a blessing to watch
SHOUT OUT TO YOU DEV🔥🔥🔥
The commentating was incredible. ESPN take notes…!
Friga deserved that one💯
They got my guy out there that do the football videos ✊🏾✊🏾
Appreciate you bro. 🙏🏿  keep doing you man
One of them YouTube's need to get #21 in black jersey on the side  buns she bad 😂
This was crazy fr! Imagine a tournament of just hype 1v1s just like this one.
Good ass game.
Are they twin brothers
Ehhhhhh
For 10k it should of went to 16 or 12
I wish i could play for that bread friga please look me up when you come east lol i would put 10k up of my own 🙏🏾🙏🏾 to play
It’s funny because these 1v1’s have nothing, skill wise, compared to the 1v1’s pros have like on J Law’s channel, no professional or serious hooper plays unlimited dribbles on 1v1’s.
Hezi had no chance
“KEEP FUCKING TALKING JENNA!” -HEZI🥷🏾
THIS WAS GOOD FOR HOOPING....SHOWING HOW MEN AND BALLERS HANDLE A COMPETITIVE ONE ON ONE.....DEV THANKS G
Dev you're the Man! All the guys and girls, the creators, mad respect for y'all.  Friga is real stand up guy 🙌🙌
I juh thought the 10$ to watch it early
Imagine if hezi could play defense
When Devin forgot its his gym and he had to make the final call, no bucket
18:05 wtf did jenna say bro
Bro That Was Dope ... GG Friga ....
So is Jenna dating friga or she just wants him to win really bad? Lol she’s literally cheering for everything he does hahah
DEV THE GOAT smpleeeeeeee 😤
respect to Friga, honest dude
These commentators man........the one with the hair REPEATS EVERYTHING the other guy says....gotta watch this with no volume
Any Video of when Kai was in the gym with you guys?
It was amazing congratulations to Friga for the W  I do know why but it’s looking like Hezi lost a bit of touch with his shoot or maybe Friga defense was to good but Let me now what’s your thought on this one tho !
Ooooooooooo 👀
Amazing game! Btw.. 29:12 3 steps.. It was Friga ball
That’s a travel
Waiting on cash reaction🔥🔥
Naaaah son this was SPECTACULAR!!! Friga being way too nice doe lol Basketball Gods was on his side
Wtf lol why was this so good!?!?
this was SO GOOD!!!
friga deserved the W foh hezi
He gave up a 6 to 0 lead damn that was a good ass game tho
Friga got his revenge 😈
hezi did this in about 30 pounds of accesories
this was dope 🤝
Damn that was intense 😬😬
Hezi did far too few hezis
Hezi would have had him if he didn't settle for the three. Friga has gotten a whole lot better and looks a step quicker.
Yessirrrrrr
Hezi traveled in the end
Is this the Goku and Vegeta of YouTube street ball? 🤔
Wow
"I'm scared of this Friga, he didn't have tattoos before." -Dev 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Dam Y Jenna turned Hezi up like that?🤣🤣
Hezi ain’t right with the defense friga ain’t quick enough to get by so why not be up in him
Fridga 🐐 great game both hezi a 🐐 as well
hezi traveled his last 2-3 moves
D-FRIG🙌🏾‼️
Damn. Friga would've won big if Hezi wasn't cheatin lol i hate dudes that foul cuz they getting beat.
Man I love you niggas 🤟🏼
Hezi thought he was still playing Kenny Chao lol
100% a travel though 😂
This was crazy
Dev has officially reached OG STATUS , what he’s doin for the game is unmatched
I payed for my ticket, and I don’t care… Im glad you posted this.  It was too epic to keep it hidden.
Amazing 1on1 🏀🏀🏀
In-spirer_ing!!! Keep it up you all. Loved every minute of this.
Dev tha real goat.... Gr8 content guys
Wow. I'm an old dude who just plays soccer. And y'all gon' make me love basketball.
i have been waiting for this moment for a while!!!
Friga better than hezi.... Hezi just a showman
Best 1 v 1 on YouTube
Hezi leaving Friga open like he’s not a shooter smh
They were both ballin !!! Great games !!
Appreciate this for real this game was amazing.. thanks Dev 💯 💪🏽
Hezi travels and fouls too much!
I liked the vid at 9:50 when hezi said “you ain’t call nothing” 🐕 🤝
Preciate it Dev..you the truth💯
Let’s see friga against DREAM CHASER
That was a good ass 1v1! Very entertaining from 2 skilled hoopers!!
This needs to be a part of the NBA all-star week. Im calling it now!!!! "Creator Classic All-star Week 2022"
#18 on trending!
Hezi is dumb, bro! All he had to do was drive to win, but he kept shooting. He is much harder to guard driving the ball, especially in a 1 point game. He choked! I knew he was gonna lose, you cant give Friga game winners... he makes those jumpers almost all the time.
These two are playing at such a high level. DFRIGA has improved so much over the year.
friga one of the most solid contempt and honest hooper i’ve seen on youtube in a while
The swiffer has me in tears
Mannn shit got dev screaming 🤣🤣🤣
Bro...kudos to you & your classy response to the hater; but accept em. ANY PUBLICITY is better than none...those who believe are followers not leaders bro!!! KEEP THE GRIND MAN!!!!!
Hezi bearly opened his bag in the first game or did Friga have his bag wide open? Second game Solid. 3rd game was everything you could ask for. The Gods like Friga cause he's such a nice guy. GREAT GAME
“Hezi” cheats and lies, deserving of the loss.  Friga is the better player all around.  Morally/Skillfully
I had Friga winning from the start. I never underestimated the HeziGod though. It was intense.
Friga so damn soft.
need to do these yearly
LESSS GOOO Friga
That’s why Friga won, cuz he doesn’t cheat and he’s mad honest💯💯👌🏽👌🏽GG
‼️🙌🏾✨ SOO TUFF , ill be there next year, best believe ‼️
This was 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This was great. But that TRAVEL THO!
Lame, friga fell off bad lol
bro @18:27 Marcelas bro 😂😂😂😂😂
Game of the year…
So glad Friga shut him up
I knew friga was gon win that shit
Dev you a real one for posting this
🔥 Dev definitely appreciate the 1v1 upload ✊🏽
Hezi: swearing the whole time, even at the other fellow creators Friga: 32:33
Like both of these guys. Hezi pushes the envelope with rules. He arguably Carries on a lot of these hezis and off hand gets a little too much stiff arm action when he goes to the rim and friga sticks on him. The fouls truly were decent both ways. It would have been kinda soft to call that one at the end and that’s why friga didn’t take it. Friga had a one or two that could have been called on him that hezi didn’t take also. Fianlly, hezi traveled at the end and insisted it was not. I personally think it was a travel fr and would not have shot for that one.
thank you Dev!
That probably the best game of the year.. no cap
AYE!!!! Hezi fasho traveled 🤣🤣🤣
Friga is a Gentleman and a Legend
hey dev, you're the goat for this. highly enjoyed the competition
Friga you won game 3 by 2 that point shouldn’t of counted his ass traveled like crazy
🍿🍿🍿
Hezi tried to pull the lebron million steps move
Hezi so overrated
Damn what a work dev 👏👌
Wish I could watch the whole thing man
TRAVELLLLLLLLL LMAO
Bruuh the gasps by Dev
Never thought I’d see a perfect 1v1
I appreciate the hell out of this dev! Thank you for giving back to the community in the way you do, you a real one!
Next year
Friga is an extremely nice dude😂
Thanks for posting Dev 🙏🏼
friga is to nice but the basketball gods new he deserved it!!!!!!
Defensive Jesus
Hezi played 0 lick of defense 😂 lol
Hezi seems different since he played Kenny?
Hezi did not respect DFriga’s outside shot and it cost him.
Hezi trash
All the hezi people shut up now y’all was all for hezi
That was traveling
LETS GET DAT MOP DOWN OUT THERE…LETS GET DAT RIGHT A  WAY…. Idk Why but that shit had me rolling😂😂😂
At 8:20 Hezi fouls Friga, makes him throw up a crazy shot then Hezi gets the ball… I’m confused
It’s crazy how every single person there is a certified bucket
Last Game was like watching a NBA finals they was going at each other great environment & energy 🔥
House  dee and jay
So you not dropping the 2v2?!💔
I really just watched hezi get away with mad fouls 😂 I feel like he knew friga wouldn’t be tripping
That definitely was a travel bruh but much respect for how Friga handled that. And how he handled that last foul call bruh Friga is legit and has no ego.
And that's a beautiful travel at 9-10 on the last game
amazing content, i loved the atmosphere.
🔥‼️
Thanks for this upload Dev. I live in brazil and to buy a ticket in dollars for me would be a hit in my finances for the month. Our currency is trash right now, 15 dollars are almost 100 BRL. Much appreciated, you're a legend
Friga really tried his best to throw that 😂   Great games!
TRAVEL!!!!!!
People will be kicking themselves in few weeks if they miss the opportunity to buy and invest in bitcoin
lets goooooo friga n thnx dev for posting the video
Will any of the other content be uploaded later?  P.s. love seeing hoopers hoop without all the extra theatrics 🤍
Wtf happen to shift team vs crimestopper
Watch it slow mo 29:00
HEZI TRAVELED!!!!
We needed that!!
Hezigod is so ass 😂😂 idk y they call him the hezigod , technically he’s not ass because he b scoring like 70 against pros but I just don’t like the way he plays lmfaoo
Shout out to Friga! His content got me started on watching YouTube basketball. That subscribe led me to DC heat, Marcel, Dev, and countless more.
Nick briz should’ve been there
Hezi walked to mexico on that play. lol
hezichock
Call me old school, but I don't love this style of 1 on 1 where it's basically 1 shot and done. Just because I missed, the defender gets the ball even if he didn't defend the shot? At the very least the defense should have to secure the rebound, and preferably clear it behind the three point line. This style is lazy imo.
Shotout to FRIGA!!!
Hezi shooting so much stressed me out
I just can't respect people who think Hesi is really good. His handles are a legit carry every single time.
Bro that was intense!!!
They play with no fouls?
Truly appreciate you posting this I really wanted to see the whole event but couldn't afford it..  Give thanks and keep it movin
lmao hezi barely tries to play defense i wanted him to clamp up
This is awesome… and the commentating was great you guys were very entertaining
Team friga ✊🏼✊🏼✊🏼 hezi trash 🗑
🔥
This shit was 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Might be the most exciting ones I’ve seen on YouTube fr, but ain’t no way dudes shooting for ball after that travel. Great ones tho💯
yessirski friga
dev we need a 60p selection
Friga won what dude been improving keep up good work or shots looking sharper
That man hezi took 5 steps talking about that’s a bucket
can we get the dunk contest video?
Hezi choked🤦🏾‍♂️
Friga stay ballin!!  Didnt know that Hezi is a Que.
this hezi dude kinda trash.
Ayee respect two both men they both did good
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
good games, awesome commentary
Where’s nick and his crew?
Hezi was sick at the end cause he know he tried to get over and still lost lmao
I want outdoor basketball to be considered it’s own legitimate sport. Events like this bring us closer to that.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
ya... travel, definitely. Basketball gods smilin' on Friga. Always a fair competitor, almost to fair sometimes. I would of gone to the cameras for that one.
Floor cool 😂😂😂😂
Mans literally traveled at the end “das a bucket bwo, das a bucket bwo”🤡😂 clown ass
Hezi needs to work on his defense. Every time I see him lose (which isn’t often), he has no defensive pressure
People want to know DBZ vs Naruto verses
I remember dev training the two young Asian men, sneaking into gyms and to be a fan of the his mindset, work ethic and self belief in his abilities it’s refreshing to see it all pay off years down the line, salute dev
anyone know what shoes friga was wearing?
3 dribbles I got friga unlimited I got hezi
hezi no d.  No wonder he rode the bench in college.  Theres levels to this game. You got to play defence.  hezi aint got no d.   His defence is HORRIBLE. Just straight fouling the other player.  Would have been fouled out in a real game.
He says everything twice... mad annoying lol
"We wont be putting this on youtube" "No reactors will be allowed to react to this" "Final 3 days to watch the creator classic" Thanks for lying dev. No ones gonna buy future creator classic tickets now🤦🏿‍♂️
He got tattoos now.  I’m scared of Friga
STG better than nba..... 😍😍
Next time I move from the 3 point line to the basket wit no dribbles, “that’s a bucket!”🤣
All offense and no defense.....  That's the big different between old school vs new school basketball. Old school played defense or at least tried, new school defense is a lost art. No one tried to readjust for defense it was all readjustments for offense.
23:35 🤯🤯
Hezi took three steps crazy!!!
Friga cold as a trick in the winter 🥶
29:10 was that 4 steps? bad travel either way.
That was a clear carry into a travel.
Why didn't Hezi play defense?
That foul and travel on hezi👀 ball don’t lie
Dev setting trends out herea
In the lab culture changer
I’m sorry hezi you traveled 💯
Well done to all! Well done to Jen for adding fire and energy on the last run!
im not gonna lie w all the hype surrounding this i couldn't help but think that i was probably gonna be a little disappointed in the end but guess what im definitely not disappointed, this is just great fucking content. shoutout to hezi, friga and the biggest shoutout goes to dev.
Ref is definitely needed for the next one. Fire match up
Street ball winning! 👏 fuck cheesy ass corporate sellout nba.
This was def the 1v1 of the year
I am so glad that Friga won this. He is best basketball youtuber andd best guy out there
Nick briz you cant guard dev or friga or hezi you trash bro
Friga and hezi were fire
Friga allowing Hesi to shoot for ball after he traveled was one thing, but I’ve never seen both players shoot until a make for the ball. It’s do or die. C’mon man. You too nice Friga! ✊🏼
That's the lab yall
Unbiased commentary. Gotta love it
Friga is literally the best no questions
Where the one piece wall paper dev?
👏👏
This is live I love it yaw keep em comingb
DEV UR A REAL ONE KING! thx sooo much for uploading this.. I was soooo sad knowing I missed it bc I didn’t have 10 bucks.. that’s just sad smh 🤦🏾‍♀️ I gotta do better.
Damn dev a goat I was waiting til I get paid Friday to get it and IM STILL GETTING IT BIG IN THE LAB GANG 🤘🏾🤘🏾🤘🏾
Man friga's a bucket
Watched the whole thing
Like if Hezi traveled.... Respect to Hezi and Friga tho💯💯💪
Literally never seen Hezi play defense ever at least not actually contesting 3’s lmfaoo
You need to play all ones or move 3 pointer up....
Need the mics on the players louder
Thanks Dev For putting out this classic 💪🔥💯
that was not a travel!
This game is one of the best one vs one I've ever seen 🔥🔥🔥
exciting game. huge respect to Dev and everybody . hezi is great, friga definitely has made his presence felt and he's a good guy. very respectful. can't wait for the next content.
Is the creator classic still available to cop and watch right now?
Appreciate you Dev
He traveled his ass off
All ready looking forward to next year's creator classic💯💯💯
You can easily sell tickets for 50+ dollars rent out a highschool start small and do a meet and greets for people who buy tickets if there was fans it would be another level of Energy
To keep 💯, this whole thing was stacked in hezi's favor. Unlimited dribbling, no rebounding, no fouls, no 2's and 3's. But i get it, hezi is the smaller guy, friga a better shooter and defender. Either way im still gonna watch both. Next time do unlimited dribbles and no rebounding which helps hezi. And play 2's and 3's along with obvious foul calls since that favors friga.  In that scenario its friga 2-0
Aint no way he said no travel at 29.13 💀
What a fucking game
This is crazy game I’ve ever seen before fr 💯🏀
🔥🔥🔥
❤Search for miracles of the holy "Quran"!
Hezi being too cool for school and basically letting Friga shoot all of those uncontested 3’s was annoying as hell! It really shouldn’t have gone to a game 3 for that very reason, but thankfully it did and was still a good series of games, but that really brought it down for me..
“You can hear a mouse peeing on cotton” 😂😂😂
Great event you put together Dev.  I wish y'all got Filaay in here. He woulda gone crazy on the commentary.
Man traveled his ass off
That was a travel!
3 and lay, no midrange, and no D.
Thanks for the beautiful, creative content as always Dev. In the Lab with it!!!
Yo!!!! Dev, you a real one, bro. Thank you (and all the CREATORS) for this 🔥🔥🔥  Yo Hezi, lost some serious money off of you, bro😂great game though... Friga🤝respect, my dude!!!
Please breakdown the 2v2
I love it, I love it. Keep talking had me hype.
Dope ballers, mad respect!! but it kinda gets boring watching these fellas take turns jacking up 3 balls for half the clip!
Gd job dev Been looking forward to seeing this ty
Yooo this had to be one of the best 1v1's on YouTube 💯. The game really could've went either way.
That went from exciting to downright stressful at the end
Thankyou so much for posting this, ignore those idiots saying this isn't worth paying for
That was insane!!!
Hezi shot way to many 3s and played no defense. Cash nasty showed you the route to success shouldve followed suit
23:36 got eeeem!! nastyy....
Bruh that shot was a hoe, in and out hezi for game ffs 27:52
By far the best youtube 1v1 I've ever seen
Damn well deserved! Hezi got the ball back with that travel and even the foul at 10-10 wasn't called. Class act Friga.
Heeem heeem heeem look back  lay 23:39
Thank You In the Lab 🧪One of the best match ups in a long time and they totally delivered. That was intense. I learnt a lot watching your videos and i think of you as my mentor 🙏. I love basketball.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 thank you sensei
this is classic. thanks dev for the culture!
damn when Hezigod get a hand in his face he cant do nothing. Friga was clamping him !!
hezi only been this close cuz he foulin tbh
That last game was a friendly one lol
So dope ! Props to Friga winning, proved me wrong !
Wow where u at hezi??
It could have gone either way, both talented athletes
Instant classic
The fact that all these people in the video are doing what they love for a living is a blessing! 💪🏽
Y’all not fing with Florida
first two shots "top of the key" cash,  I can hear him saying it now , I would have got those , "wet like water baby"
#21 is good!
Hands down best 1v1 of the year 💯🔥
That was a travel no lie
Couldn't cop a ticket so I appreciate this fr. This was also probably one of the best matchups I've ever seen. If it's anything like this, can't wait to see how this event evolves. fsho making sure I'm able to cop next time.
Love hezi but 27:50 thats a travel no? Picked up his pivot foot
17:47
Stop playing with my boy Friga
Absolutely amazing.
I likes this!
BALL DONT LIE
exactly wat happens when u kno how to play defense& place your hands properly where they need to be, u dnt even gotta touch a person to play defense effectively 🤣god where
It’s dope that you gave back and evident of your character. You be trolling in one on ones sometimes but you’re a good ass dude w/community impact.
8:16 if anything that’s a foul and a half
Hesi did travel 😭
Game was amazing !🔥🔥
You doing a good thing bro
Bruh Appreciate Dev ❤️❤️
Aye this was 🔥. All around, great entertainment. 👍
Are you going to be putting up all the events
Hezi Is A    🚶🏽‍♂️ 🪣 (Walking Bucket)
https://youtu.be/QcrAMrztZr0.
27:51 - If you don't release the ball after your two steps, isn't that a travel? And if it isn't, then the two steps he took after the shot fake were definitely a travel.
Dev you a real one. Much love
W
Great event dev loved everything about it just wish we got a black vs white squads 5v5 run that would have been the epic ending . To see all thee great talents blend in with each other
This.. This is special
Dev, this even was amazing. Can’t put into words. Couldn’t watch it live cause I didn’t get off work till 11pm. Watched the replay with some shots of Remy lol. I was hyped. Every event was great. And who tf is dude who was the runner up in the dunk contest? His first 2 dunks would have got 50’s in a NBA dunk contest. This a long ass comment lol and I still haven’t said all I want to say about the event. Gg’s 🤝 and I can’t wait til the next one💪🏽
Damn, Friga can absolutely stroke the ball. Dudes a perfect height and size to just bully you to the rim and shoot over you
That wasn’t a travel u gotta count wen his hands goes under the ball
WTF? ...creator classic w/o tjass, aj, 2hype, briz, Stephania, cash, jlaw, Tyler relph, and the professor?
Keep goin Dev u puttin on for real 💪🏾💯
rim did not want this game to end
Hezi stop hacking bro.... lame af
Copped a ticket to watch this on vacation in Benin Republic. Definitely worth a 2nd watch. Big up Dev!
Marcelas is a natural at commentating
Marcel's "DAMN!" 😂
history was made big shoutouts to Friga holding it down representing what real basketball look like
Couldn’t afford the ticket but I really do appreciate you posting this Dev! I’m a supporter of the channel and genuinely love the game of basketball I will be copping a ticket next year most definitely this was a must watch no doubt
This was fire 🔥 ... at the end, I was literally sweating and really anxious to see who's gonna win.
That was well fought by them both. It is indeed a classic. <3
Mad respect to Dev and ITL for the content so I’m commenting for support
Yooooo my man’s, that travel…. You know you stepped 3/4 times it was so obvious 😮‍💨
Lmaoo all y’all hezi riders can sit tf down now
Hezi took 5 steps talking about “thats a bucket!” 💀💀
29:20 that's a bucket that's a bucket LOL. I'm telling you, people be calling whatever BS they can when the games on the line. It's a part of the game, I respect it but it's hella funny
algo
hezi walked lol 😂
Hezi defense is his offense lol.. just gonna try to outscore you
We need to seed Friga and Hezi on the same team. A literal cheat code
How can you root against friga man he's so humble
Clear clear travel
Amazing content as always i would say but this is kind of next lvl 👀🔥
friga needa poke that thing..
why is there no ref for this kinda amazing game
THANK YOU DEV <3
Don’t understand why Hesi would not play basic D. Gave a good shooter unlimited clean looks
If Hezi God would have just played a little bit more defense in the 1st 2 games and he might have won
Lets fucking go friga
carry @7:20
Hesi started gettin desperate in the end and it showed . GG tho
😂 what did Jenna say?
This was dope!  @Dev  I really need you to push this on the NBA, GLeague, NCAA, and WNBA.  We need to see the best of the best bring this same energy to the game
I love y’all but you shouldn’t have commentated
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Intense 🔥🔥🔥
Dev is such a great guy! Love this group of people!! 🤩🙏🏽🙏🏽
Amazing game!!! Loved it!
I played it back in slow motion and it was a clear three full steps… that was a clear travel, but the ball don’t lie in the end…. Great game between great players.
Some travels but if camera caught the travel it should be called its illegal for a reason
Had me out ma seat the whole video
Great game…. But the commentary was on that corny “wipeout” type show level… lol… good stuff though.. thanks for making this happen…  great content.
Fundamentals (Dfreeze)> Flashiness (Hezi)
Tough…that’s all I can say. Both these dudes goated. Best 1v1 I’ve seen on YouTube
XRM vs Filayyy pro vs pro
The man 🔥🔥🔥 Much love from NEW ZEALAND 🇳🇿
JLaw vs Friga
Definitely a travel 😹😹😹😹
i want see marcelas get in that action.
FRIGA STAY BALLIN YOUNG MAN and that was a blatant travel  on hezi 😂😂
😱🤯🤯
Y’all commentary was annoying 😂 y’all gotta get some scripts written down for situational basketball. It wouldn’t have been as bad but they were missing getting the jitters out and y’all was too hype.
Thanks for uploading this! <3
peopel dont no friga lead his conference in scoring. he shoot with easyyyy
Whata game !!! Thank you dev 🙏🏽
Nah really appreciate y’all for posting this
Shout out to those that copped the creator classic. I know the shirt i got from buying a ticket is 🔥🔥🔥
Im so glad Friga won...I like Hezi but he just pissed me off here...as soon as he started losing he started cheating and finessing, he didnt deserve that shit....I dont understand how is this 1v1 so intense and you let the guy travel and then let him shoot for the ball...nah you travelled, issa turnover, bye...and hezi was agressive bout that shit too like cmon man
Really appreciate it the love the show. Your creating a new fun event hope this last longer than our generation
I wanna see that Jay Jones and Friga rematch
yo we need more of these this was so fire to watch
These 2 on the same team y’all better watch out frfr💯✊🏿✊🏿✊🏿
I genuinely couldnt buy i tried to ask my parents lmfao glad u uploaded this dev i got u next year tho fs!
DAILY REMINDER: TALKING TRASH IN GAME IS NOT HATE
Dev the Man❗️
He called the bitch out 🤣🤣
Much appreciated Dev, this entire event was top notch quality 💯👌🏽 Look forward to the next one!
East coast hoopers need some YouTube hooper man ima get that shit poppin cuz west coast hoopers be lit
Bruh hesi let him shoot so many uncontested shots thinking he would miss.. friga made him pay. Well deserved. Shoutout both competitors
Spencer dinwiddie a good ass announcer
This is more exciting than the NBA, yeah I said it!!!! 😤
Dev you a real one for this, I still wish I watched it live
Hezi got the handles but tried to cheat at the end with that blatant travel and bogus no call on the foul. Frigga is the more poised player and a much better shooter. I just wish hezigod took the damn thing to the rack more. Dude got handles for days but shooting just as many shoots in a 1v1 as Frigga even though Frigga the better shooter. Fun match to watch either way.
Hezi or K Showtime vs Clamp God
And yall didn't believe in friga
Hezi god swears
thats exactly why i was rootin for hezi cuz hes the villian and i fuck wit friga great fuckin game bruh!
Hezi Gotta put  Keep F-ing talking on a shirt.
These dudes travel they asses off
Deep down hezi felt bad bout dat travel he knew trust me !!
S/o to friga
🔥🔥🔥🔥
and while it was 3 steps.. the way he picked up the ball.. man, its really close. To me, in the NBA that's a bucket and at the park.
Jenna's set off was amazing
I coulda swore I saw y’all arguing with people in the comments saying you not gonna drop it and nobody gonna drop reaction videos to it like 1 day ago but I ain’t gon complain 😂😂😂
he was loosing his girl , good for him . great game
what an amazing experience yo. This was on point on all the levels. I was sitting here, laughing, smiling, and getting hype and yelling all by myself at midnight haha.  This isnt the future yo.. this hot right now. Ima big fan.
pretty nifty move, don't think it was a travel. he carries the ball, but it's right after his gather step so it doesn't matter. it just looked weird cuz he never gathered the ball w/ both hands
video was great…but…. i’m waiting on you to humble cashnasty😂
Welp now I know why hezi doesn't play defense he really bit that weak ass hesi from friga💀💀💀
The swifter to clean the court🤣
The real reason why we're in the comment section is to learn what tf Jenna said lmaoo.  Hezi fr is my favorite antagonist. Homie's always spawning wherever Ballislife shows up and drops buckets with no team.
See I didn't even payed lmao 😂 thank you DEV
30:43 "tags self in" , hell yes!!!!!
Let’s go Friga!!!! My dude got fouled BIG time but he said we playing prison ball!!!! Lol let’s go!!!
GREAT GAME GUYZ!!  CONGRATULATIONS FRIGA!!  WELL PLAYED HEZI! WHAT A BEAUTIFUL TOURNAMENT ARRANGED BY DEV! SO TY FOR DAT..  &... I LOVE FRIGA MANN 🤑
Jenna big Bowling pin headahh got her shit shut by hezi💀💀💀💀💀
Friga, Friga, Friga. Was this scripted, 'cause you really didn't need to make it that hard.
He didnt travel
I’ve never found marcelas commentary funny
Just here to comment that Hezi for sure traveled lol
Too much talking, in my opinion.. But great basketball
Dev bro i was so sad I couldn’t get it my dad said no but your really came through bro thanks.
I been waiting on this yo! I fw both of them but @hezi my guy! #alllove
Walk
couldn’t catch it live bc of work and school thanks dev for making this vid man huge respect
He said I’m scared of tatted friga he said I’m nervous now 😂😂😂😂🤣 great content
Day 1 since them academy of art days
fire
dev was watching this game like, "Damn i'm a genius!"  lmaoo YOU ARE!! perfect personalities for a main event.. the "good guy" vs the "villian"
the commentary is fun, guys!!! gg's!!
Hezi traveled I slowed it down
Thanks for dropping the video…….
Hezi travelled twice end game ! Shout-out to Friga for respecting the calls . Greats game overall.
Ty friga for doubting these haters😂
appreciate all this. ball is love
mad respect to Friga
18:50 Hezi's staredown, i'm on the floor bro, rolling
Thanks for this one Dev !!! 🤘
Yo this is the funniest coolest shit I’ve ever seen in my life! 😂 Dev & Marcelas on the mic is comedy. I’m on game 3 now but wanted to say that I got mad love & respect for you for sharing this with us Dev. Thank you for putting this on and creating life changing content for all these years. I feel like I speak for all of us when I say thank you. Couldn’t say it enough ❤️🙏
Hezi know he coulda won but just couldn’t get buckets
667
Cheated and still lost 🤦‍♂️
Thanks Dev appreciate this
Y'all making big moves with this event for content creators in the future for sure. I know this will pioneer something great.
And ik he was gone win this game ‼️
This is how to use the internet,folks!!!! Appreciate you!!!!
Thank you for dropping this thought I wouldn’t get to watch
Hezi ego is worse than nick briz 😆
You guys already know. Hezi needs to get sweaty af before he starts heating up
💯💯💯
Big ups for uploading this for free! Wanted to get a ticket but just couldn't right now. Was hype to see this though
I gotta defend hezi for the “travel”. Even though I dislike his demeanor, he made a legal play.  As dev has previously demonstrated, you can take as many steps as long as the dribble was alive, and imo, the gather happens when his palm went under the ball - the step he is in when that happens is the zero step - then he took two steps (left and right to release). The way I see it. He got the point taken away. It may look odd because he took these steps without the ball bouncing, but I only care about when the gather happens, and that’s when the hand goes UNDER the ball, in stead of on the side.  I’m not arguing why should have won or whether the foul calls were fair. It only seems to me that people were confusing the rules in the comments.
Thank God Friga won cuz that was such an obvious travel from Hezi
Woohoo love this channel
GET OFF THE COURT HEZI ✋🏼
Let’s go friga klay thompson with the shot boy 👌🏽🔥🔥
Its betta when its 2 or 3 dribbles
What a game
Oh shit they got tre out there
This guy marcelas said defensive Jesus😂😂😂😂
Hezi never been the same eve since that 1v1 with that uncle guy
friga hard right should be his name
Dev just earned a new sub and hella respect to you for showing this one came from Friga channel 🙏🏻
Jenna being doing too much sometimes but dope event dev. Wasn’t a travel on hezi that last game tho.
Dev is a amazing commentator 💯💪🏾
more of this we likes this
💯
I was going for hezi but after that bs at the end I wanted friga to win 🔥
All love man 🙏
Dev you didn't have too do this, that's love
Love the vids man keep doing you man🔥🔥🔥
Flight- “I would’ve beaten both of them in my sleep…” *dolphin laugh* 🐬
Heziiii traveled nothing controversial.
Mane I need filayy to run it. I think he the toughest one
Why hezi refuse to put a hand up 😂😂
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Hezi Gods lack of D was his downfall...but this was dope thanks dev much love🔥it was a good game...respect to both...friga really stepped up his game...hezi should've went for an easy lay
Friga the goat 🐐
Can’t tell you how much I appreciate this dev. Definitely supporting you next time
I played it back in slowmo yea i dont think that was a travel my guy. Close game tho
Marceles jumping up and down screaming yes was me in my living room 😭😭
Game time!
Appreciate it!
Thanks Dev for letting us watch it for free!! I'll have to cop some gear soon
Amazing game. Hezi shouldn’t have given up that first game like that haha. Over confidence is sometimes a killer… but friga def upgrAded his game!
Ballgame baby
We appreciate all the hard work y’all put in to this event💪🏾 All you creators are the 🐐 especially you dev👑
Hezis footwork at 7:18 is insane throughout this entire play.
🙏🏽
Bro that was the travel of all travels by Hezi lol.
It’s friga loss that last game, he still would of won cuz of all the bs 😂
This was absolutely amazing right down to the last second. Thanks Dev for giving us this!
This was absolutely special...  hands down best 1v1 I've seen so far on YT
That IS a big TRAVEL…
Man the intensity was fucking real. Really good game from both Friga and Hezi. Respect 💯
He definitely traveled
Appreciate it man just keep up the good work man
Anyone can shoot highschool range
Goku vs. Vegeta
Appreciate you for this dev
Wow classic
This is so amazing 💯💯🔥🔥🔥
Dev is a real goat for making this event. Bringing everyone’s favorite content creators together and just straight HOOP SESSIONS. This did not disappoint at all. Dev a straight genius
Look at deestroying 😂
Marcel sounded like a adlib goat 😭🤣 money worth spent 🕺
Frigas defense is under apreciated. He was waving his 👋 hands in the face at hezi. And offense is quick and concise. Yin and the yang
If this is just the beginning, I can’t wait to see what comes next! 🔥🏀🔥🏀🔥😱
Friga been working on his game
Ngl Friga earned my respect ode bro really tuff 🔥
💯
That was prob the best 1 on 1 I've seen.
Soooo wth did Jenna say ??? Lol
What is marcel doing at 18:3 0 LMFAOOOOO
hesi didn't travel watch it in .5 speed when hezi puts his hand under the ball he took 2 steps. no travel @29:11
Hesi stay grabbin on offense 😂😂😂
you cant say you love basketball and not love this video
I watched all my ads for this!
This is respect I cant wait too get involved in this one day!! This is amazing and will be huge.
Ballislife is already tryna copy this😂
This video was so good. So good yo I’m shaking. We need more games like this.
THANK YOU DEV. YOU DIDN’T HAVE TO DO THIS!! I wasn’t able to cop the ticket so this just made my week fam! LOVE BRO! ❤️💯💯
man appreciate it. been a big fan for years and love how you give back.
Hesi didn’t wana give him his foul I guess ? 😂
Great Game, perfect villain/hero dynamic. I didn't care who won, just great basketball & showmanship.
8:00 I love how 💯 Dev is about Friga being a different player this year. You can see the growth in his game mostly mentally. No fear
Holy shit that was insane! Skywalker vs Vader! I think Hezi definitely traveled, but I think he was trying to break Friga's rhythm a bit, but it backfired at the end.   Instant ESPN Classic right there!!
Good shit Dev . Sup Cel
THIS IS THE 1V1 of the year 🗣 .. who agree ?
couldve done without Marcelas just repeating everything Dev said. Thought my computer had an echo
6:10 that side step 3 was so flawless
Dev is a real one and I support all that he is doing rn. It is great for the sport and the community. Nothin but love and respect
Ignore everything   That was a TRAVEL and a half
HeziGod a cheat! Traveled 🧳 lol  Wanted all the calls, have no respect for him. Friga way to nice luckily he won!
GG thank you for putting this together
I didn’t pay for Hezi and friga but I will pay for Filayyy & TJazz
Friga is real genuine, what a class act
Hezi traveled a couple of times so I'm glad Friga was still able to get the W.
How can I get in the lab 🤔
This was so dope!! Both guys are talented I love it
Thanks dev and everyone!
Ball Don’t Lie!!!!!
Aye, I wanted Friga to win. Let’s go FRIGA!!
scrubbin thru and got caught way off guard by 25:04 lmao cel sus
Respect ✊ 🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷
W video
The amount of times Cel & Dev said "Oooweee" thought they were Mr. Poopybutthole 🥴😂
I love this idea. It looks like a real great move for you guys and you are the best people to do it. You should consider doing a stat sheet to keep a record or add a point value system to each player's name. That way a novice can one day get to the level to play one of the pros. Just like in boxing.
Not to be a hater but hezi god does so much traveling and carrying and push offs it’s stupid his style of play is only for YouTube and street ball
100% travel on that 9-10 score lol.
he took like 4 steps lol
*standing O*
Mad as hell lmao
The suspense was real... thank u! 🔥💪
hezi had that but takes too many breaks on defense and was forcing too many 3s. Think if he settled for more mid ranges he woulda had it and tried to drive when he was up 6-0. Good close games and lots of in and out the rim shots.
Friga legit the opposite of Cash lol, humble as hell and a straight baller and insane shooter.
Dang Dev thank you so much man I was sad I missed the event I really wanted to see this 1v1
Ain’t gonna lie hezi was fouling way more and he did travel bad 😂
Should’ve had fans
Ball game! Hezi out there talking too much and it was an obvious foul when it was 10 10 but friga too nice with it and still came up clutch
Friga deserved that even though he was getting low key cheated
THANK YOU DEV!
Best 1 on 1 to date!
Best 1 v 1 of the year   Now get solluminati to come to creator classic
Devs always been a classic goat, glad this community has only gotten stronger throughout the years
Hezi did take 5 steps
🔥🔥🔥
dev and marcel bouncing in unison was not something i was expecting
Call a carry please. Like a legit call..I just wanna know what y’all let go and what y’all actually callin
Good shit in the lab u don’t even have to put this out for us u jus being a real nigga for the fans and showing love.
This was a great game! Entertaining and was breathtaking.
Dammit I wanted to buy it
shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
Friga is the most humble guy I kno on YouTube. Dude is a competitor and he’s fair at the same time.He don’t argue even when he’s being cheated.Respect to Friga 💯
Yo Dev you owe me a new TV. It burned up bc this game was 🔥🔥🔥
Legendary
🍿
That event was mad fire S/O to all tge creators big S/O to dev 🔥
Energy wise it’s like Tim Duncan vs KG
Hezi or hesitation
Hezi a straight villain but friga had the basketball God's watching.  Great game
Somewhere Nick Briz is saying “Game Time, Game Time” 🤡
It’s all love from me ong you got great content
Legendary 🙌🏿🤎
Appreciate it dev🤝
29:10 def a travel lmao how he say it's a bucket with a straight face..
Bruh I love Friga but your niceness gonna get you run over and cheated because niggas would do anything to win
Hezi HELLA TRAVELED
when hezi missed the game winning shot did he travel? not trying to talk bad just the footwork in this 1v1 was amazing
thank you because my wife took my last $10 so I couldn't pay for it lol
I was finna be mad if Friga didn’t win 🤦🏿‍♂️
Friga needs to start owning it more, seemed like he almost felt bad for winning..
Damn!!!!! I’m upset with myself for not getting a fucking ticket! But congratulations this is SUPER DOPE
Great game hezi traveled tho no cap and he didn’t need to
How do you lose to Cash Nasty then beat Hezi God? Lol 🥴
Dev ur the real one wasn‘t mad i coudn’t cop a tkt n watch it live…but thanx for uploading it for us to experience it..
Thank you dev for uploading this even though you didn’t have to just giving us free content when you spent 70k of your money on this event and your still willing to show us love and give us this vid. appreciate you #inthelab #creatorsclassic
*Friga too nice/humble, that's why Cash took advantage and won* 💯😹
Much love dev you the goat for this event and for uploading this one for us.
Wtf I literally asked every video when and where I could watch this and paid $17 on Saturday to watch the replay of the event and now it’s being released for free on your channel 2 days later. That’s stupid you taxin next time just air it free or charge only and don’t play it free. Do payperviews get played free by the promoters 3 days later? Horrible business model
Dat nigga travelled
Thank you bro I can’t afford the stream I wish but my mom doesn’t want me spending money on Bullshit she’s says
If ya slow down the play speed you can see that it was a gather. Its super tricky but in my opinion its not a travel
Good game he traveled hard af 😂😂😂
TRAVEL
Damn, I really wanted to see filayyy and t jass and professor play in this lol.
What a game 🔥🔥🔥
The first of many many more to come.. loved it.. Friga and Hezi really setting the stage for the wave of ballers to come.   One thing you guys gotta do for next time is pack the sidelines with people and make it like a real 1v1 outdoor, gotta keep the vibe and element there from the sidleines in packed parks.    All in all it was well done. I think this thing could go to limits not yet before seen. Keep doing Dev!
the last game, especially towards the end, had me at the edge of my seat. i can’t believe how many shots each missed in the last game. so many were speculating that hezi won based off of vids hezi was in with ballislife, and the reaction friga gave in the trailer, so i’m even more hyped that friga won
Dude traveled so bad 😭
I see Nelly Chan over there!
girls really be making dudes go ham. Jenna spke and hezi went nuts lmao
One of the greatest 1vs1 on YouTube!
Video only manageable on MUTE.
FRIGAAA
love have friga gave it to him on that last foul call, I wouldn’t 😂 but love it 🙏🏽 made the last bucket so much better
You can tell Hezi's pissed
Dope commentators
Keep fucking talking Jenna!
Thank you Dev, I'm pretty new to the channel so i was not aware of this. But next year i will definitepy tune in on time!
I never wanted someone to lose so bad. Good flippin game frigaaaaa. Brodie tried to cheat at the end don’t @ me at ALL!! Real hoppers know Hezi tried to snake a win 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Rhat was a travel
😂 I’m nervous Friga didn’t have tattoos before I’m nervous  ayo Devin and Marcelas need to commentate some park takeovers
Dev any idea of who’s going to be in the next creator classic? And y’all should have a womens 1v1
Friga humility
TRAVELLLLLLLLLLL
hezi needs to stop calling himself "god" and stop with the carry lol  :D
Dev can I send you proof I brought a ticket for shoes
Friga to nice 🤦‍♂️
GAME OF THE DAMN YEAR
Great game
Coppin the next creator classic for damn sure
Hezi tried to bully his way to a w...lol Traveled on the pump fake 3 and that lay up. Def fouled on that friga lay up(whole gym got quiet). lmao He should be greatful friga just lets things go (shrugs). Good game and good event. Much respect !!!!!!!
YESSIRRRRRRRER
Last part def a travel n foul on hezi lmaoo I get y’all in the cage or whatever at least get a pro ref
Watching it again 😭 what a match
friga just doesnt use his body enough on drives lol
and cash still think he better than friga lol
Respect Dev. This is the biggest development in street ball since the And 1 days. Great work, a whole new stream of opportunity and culture on the rise💪🏾
Damn should have invited nick
I always feel like Hezi God holding back. IMO
This was so fire🔥🔥
Dam this shit was actually fucken dope
I see the game on other Channel and What ?
Dev thank you always a treat
I get friga is a good guy but I hate how friendly he is in these 1v1s 😂 whoever im playing im at yo head all game
Dat nigga Jeremy stay with some food 😂😂
Appreciate you 🔥🔥
Dam intense! Shit was crazy! 🙏🏼
Let’s fakin go FRIGAAA SECURED MY BAG THANK YOU
Hezi is TIGHT that man was cheating at the end tho he wanted it lol. Bout time Friga got a good dub. He gotta stop playing that nice guy role in these 1v's they be costing him games. Appreciate you posting this Dev!
🐐🐐
Damn that was a good 1v1! Felt like Hezi could’ve played better defense tho! These dudes on another level . W fasho
Hezi-god a fraud lol. Obvious travel and obvious foul at the end of game 3.
Hezi got away with the travel and still lost🤣
Good game overall, definitely became a fan of Friga after this. Dude stayed calm and is super chill, he's too kind . Lol
i REALLY APPRECIATE IT DEV TYSM
Greatest event of the fcking year!
My guy Jordan!
Friga is playing with hezi. He got too many moves.
Very entertaining video, friga earned that W
Friga all the way!
i dont care what will everyone will say.. THIS IS 1v1 of THE YEAR.
I couldn’t support by getting a ticket but I’ll get a fye ass hoodie doe 💯
appreciate you for doing this dev, you a real one. I wouldve bought it if i wasnt in my situation
Hezi won the game bro look at it closely at 29:13 it wasn’t a travel slo mo it ! They cheated that mans 🤣🤣 all good though friga needed that anyway already took L’s from J Jones and Dev
Friga is too nice. I ain’t shooting for shit on that travel. That’s my rock lol
Just wanted to say the production on this with the different cameras angles in and out was impressive man.  The game was absolutely bananas too.  Most entertaining thing I’ve seen on here for awhile. Had me sweatin from the forehead. Oh and that was 100% a travel lol.
Friga = always humble, always a class act.
I was so hype watching this live!!! Friga my boy!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 the audacity of hezi God. That boy took off running with the ball
Fair calls all the way down but that travel on hesi coulda went either way
This event was soooooo lit I can't wait til next year 💪 💯 🔥
i think kickgenius will do great with the commentary on this type of settings. tre good can be really insightful
Bball gods blessed Friga for his humbleness
Aye Ian gon lie they gotta run that back straight classic
KICK GENIUSSS  HOOOOOOOUSE
Both players are good but friga could not get to the rack at all.
Yeah bro if I had it I would’ve paid for it
Hezigod plays defense like James Harden
This is definitely one for the books man. Much respect too these two right here man truly earned their respect ✊🏽
Cash about to be salty again. Because friga di not take him serious.
Friga is a different beast when he gets hot
I'm surprised cancel culture not getting at Hezi for yelling at Jenna Lol
Dev send me a PayPal or some account to send something over
I wanna see Hezi vs Carlos 😂
🔥🔥🔥
Bruh hezi traveled so hard at the end bro😂😂 good watch tho entertaining as hell
Hesi sold
Nahhhh hesi 100% traveled
Dude I was stressin I wanted Friga to win that so bad
1v1 the better shooter on the day usually wins
Glad Friga won Hezi run his mouth too much
22:22 hezi has lost my respect.
I just paid for this and watched it couple of hours ago, bro I’m soooo proud of you and everyone that took part in this, frontlines and behind the scenes, even the ball boys! I’m watching it again, that’s how much I enjoyed it! Congrats to you all! And Friga is definitely did his thang! 👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
Copped a ticket and still had to come back here to watch again! Congrats on the whole Classic, Dev.
Hezi hacking and Friga still win xD
🐐
Friga really humble and generous, he didn't call a lot of violations from Hezi: extension push off, travel. They're both very skilled but Friga has the more polished shot and footwork game. Hezi calling Jenna out though, but that's just his character.
Mad love!!
Hezi go right just about everytime he need get with dev and work on his left hand good game tho these one on one matches be fun to watch
Dev, you should somehow make a cage tournament with all the players you’ve trained that we know. Like the Wong bros, Trev, Christian, and all that lol. Random thought
I knew friga was gonna win man that boi can hoop, plus friga was never cocky in this game so that gave him the win.
Friga not complaining or calling foul at 10-10 is why I respect him as a hooper. Kept it real and said we ain't been calling that all game I ain't switching up cause the game on the line. Dude wanted to win but not like that and was willing to take the L just to stand on his morals. Most hoppers woulda def called or made a big deal about that. With that said Hesi is cold his bag along with his competitiveness is just different. Respect to both of yall, Great battle can't wait to see it ran back.
Thank you Dev and please keep doing what you do best💯💯💯🏀🏀🏀💪💪💪🔥🔥🔥🐐🐐🐐😁😁😁
Hezi my boy but he walked like he** lol 29:10
Shout out to not just the amazing athletes that participated in this but shout out to Devinthelab for allowing us to witness history this is why we love the game of basketball man good shit fellas  Nobody was calling petty fouls they came to hoop and nothing less and I was rooting for Friga glad he pulled it out good shit
Great game but Friga deserved it. Hesi got away with a four step travel and a non vertical foul and still folded. Friga showcasing the shooting range on full display against tough comp
Best 1v1 of the year
Damn, I guess cash is really the king now.
Friga needs some new shoes. Guy dusts his shoes off like every 5 seconds lol
Gg
Invite bone collector next time 🧑‍🍳 🦴
Good shit frig !!!
Friga’s personality is dope af
Never seen Hezi this nervous.
I really wanna know what Jenna said to piss Hezi off
Big travel hezi
Is it just me or did the commentary make the 1v1 more entertaining
We appreciate Dev and the Creators…..even tho I did not buy a ticket I am sorry 😔
looking like it’s bout to be a good one 💪
Great game!!
I hope u can get Fillayy up in the next one…. U and him one on one would be dope
Bruv after watching Nick Briz.. this is like a breath of fresh air!
Best basketball vid on yt
“He better turn into the clamp god” 😂😂 Dev you are funny asl bro
did yall not see the rat that ran on the court @ 23:34 i guess hezigod was the only one because he attempted to pick it up
OOOOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
Great ass game! Need to put some chairs in the cage for you can have a crowd of some sort ! This is going be elite I can see it 💪💪
Brah this is without a doubt the best 1v1 I’ve seen on YouTube… you could feel the tension and animosity. S/O Dev bro, need this again next year!!
Crazy good 1v1 but i know Hesi is mad as hell he lost 😭
Frigga a shooter gotta put a hand up everytime he shoot even if it’s a bad shot 🤦‍♂️ hezi cold af I say he lost just cause he was tryna cheat at end lol
Great games!! Mad props to both!!
I couldn't play against Hesi. He's good but cmon, dude is carrying and charging consistently. Its a 1v1 and he checking rock from half court getting running starts lol Even for "streetball", his style of play is excessive
Bro, thank you Dev! God bless!
This was Hella dope! Appreciate y’all for putting this great event together! Looking forward to next year and more to come! 💯
1 V 1s done like this should be on network television with sponsors like the Big 3
love u dev keep it up
🤣🤡
I’m your next creator classic you should have some of your students in it that would cool to see
No negative vibes and true hoopers. This is what I can promote and get behind
Get this global let's go best entertainment
best spent money for content ever. Completely erased the ball is life east vs west taste away by miles no disrespect to them or that platform it just wasnt what I expected but this delivered so much id pay again if I could lmao them commentator game was top tier to Dev lol blessings from Georgia brotha keep the pressure applied to the game you really making a map for so many kids who didnt get the opportunities we ran into thats major respect all day brotha !
Nobody know who the fuck the commentator is lmao we here for hezi & friga nigga 😭😭😂
LOVE
Friga to the NBA💯🔥🔥
Friga could’ve been won if he stop playing with his food
Legendary
This is the line to watch Cash Nasty’s reaction
Ngl I like the timing of the creator classic being right before the nba season and during festival time it’s 🔥
This is what I'm talking about 1v1 that means something.. I need a Creator Classic Jersey or shorts though..
Those Guys had the net on fire!!! That was the perfect ying and yang battle.
Hezi ain’t talking crazy against a real hooper 🤔😂
Dev your brand has grown a lot ! What you’re doing is a big inspiration to others and myself , continue being you!
Respect bro❤️❤️
this is MAD LOVE dev ❤️
Dev could I buy it ? I’m not going to lie for almost 20 dollars now I wasn’t going to buy it but after seeing the first 3 minutes of this video I’m sold I need to see the entire event
damn i paid too
Friga is too goddam nice 🤣
Great Battle 💯
im watching the ads to support my brothers
Friga always been that guy. He just let his game do the talking and don’t call fouls when obviously he got fouled even more respect I hate calling fouls too so I get it.
Goat for this dev you are amazing creator and amazing person
Can someone tell me who won the 2 v 2 matchup?
Last game had me on the edge of my seat with a heart rate of 200 bpm. They both couldn't hit nearing the end of the game. Good 1's!!!
I paid she I'm watching it here too.... Was an amazing event.
LETS FUCKING GOOOOO FRIGACGAGAGAAAAAAA

Appreciate this bro!! I was so mad that I wasn’t able to catch any of the creator classic, glad I at least get to peep this 1v1!!! And maaaaaaaan was it worth it!
You the goat dev ! I wanted to see this So bad ! And ima be at the next one , as a creator 👏🏾👏🏾 much love !
HEZI is still awesome! His skills are ridiculous and he's a great entertainer.
i think friga could have been won if he stop shooting half court
Love this great game
Preciate dev for doing this fr I’m going through tough times rn and even 10$ a lot lmao
Travel or naw? I say ye
friga is too nice bro he always give ppl calls when he shouldn't
Let’s go
Dang friga just posted a pic in spoiled it for me 🤦🏾‍♂️
Even tho hezi was tryna cheat, friga still won bro respect to friga for giving hezi his calls
thank u devin in the lab u are a goat . I respect u now
Thank you dev
That was OUTSTANDING! Well done Devin & Frigga.
So they called travel?? Or nah. They shot for it and he I got it? If no travel then that’s a bucket. Counting that bucket friga only won by one🤔
Friga 🔥 all love too man ! How can anyone not root for this man
Jajajjajaja hezi god
Thanks Dev for this
This was dope
thank you Dev! We all appreciate you, all love.
Hezi be trying to finesse when it gets close 😂 but dope 1v1 respect to both, they played crazy good on both sides
I really appreciate that you uploaded this man. I was waiting for this event for a long time, but a lot of life stuff happened. Anyways, thanks again Dev, you really doing a lot for the ball community on YouTube
hezi won it wasnt a travel slow it down if you have to and i fw friga more
Dev you just straight W for this
Thanks dev
My respect got up for friga man dude so humble god bless🙏
nah hezi traveled like hell on that layup 😂😂😂
i told ya..easy dub for friga
That was so dope
Friga got so much better
That’s how you do it💯💯 way to set an example
For some reason at 10: 10 I was like I don’t feel like hezi winning like when hezi shot I couldn’t accept him winning nd I rock with him
this so cool bro let the people who couldn’t pay watch a bit, love dev
This is only the beginning… the potential of this event is limitless ⬆️ 🌌
Are we gonna see a film session on this game or your post game thoughts?
So this means Cash is better than both of them?
Dang dev. Appreciate you putting this up! That was one of the most suspenseful 1v1 I've seen.
Respect this man Dev he just blessed y'all
🍿🍿
HELL OF A BATTLE!!
This gotta be a yearly thing. Idgaf if it’s $25-$50 this was worth every cent!!!
This was liiiit
u know dev and cel mad friga won bwhahaha 🤣
Lest go friga
I wanna see Professor playing against these guys too
Workers
Great game!
This shit was 🔥
Thank yall for the dope content. Much respect to all of you
I know Friga doesn't like to argue, but you have to argue that foul call when the game is on the line. I typically don't call fouls unless the game is on the line.
Hell yeah dev copped the event loved it keep these Nick Brizz lovers out the section. The culture is alive and well Dev is our Atlas.
In the lab is changing the yt game .
FRIGA!!!!!!!!! W 🔥💯
Yea you got me fucked up if you think I’m shooting for that travel.  That was a clear flat out travel. Don’t tell me anything about a gather step neither. Fortunately Friga won any way
friga is just better. lowkey more polished as a hooper
🔥🔥
Hezi aint had to shoot for game shudda took it to the rack🤦🏾‍♂️
Watched his video when he first started traveling to do 1v1s to this. Inspirational guy
Thanks for sharing this! Much appreciated 🙏🏻
Let’s go friga! Big fan from Fresno
No lie, Hezi had to cheat lmaoo traveled and then said he aint foul him 🤣 good game though
Hey dev u gotta link too cop that black panther like necklace? I need that
Would the winners from the current had got a notification from now a something or gotta wait till they send it out
Thanks for blessing us with this heavy weight match up 🙏🏽
You should do a highlight of the creator classic for the ones who couldn’t cop a ticket and missed it
Good stuff! I enjoy this and it’s good for up and coming players as well to learn a few tricks
One thing about life u do good good gonna return fashoooo🐐
Tuff fucking 1v1 both of them did amazing thanks for this Dev 🔥🔥
This is a new wave...
thanks for posting dev, this was fire
Yo thank u dev and cel cuz I am broke and u guys still got me the best games thanks keep it up plzzzz
Thanks for Everything your doing for the Basketball community Dev💯💯💯💪
I gotta keep it real, it ain’t a real one on one, without rebounds.  That’s literally how you played, the whole time, while you were a kid.
shoutout to dev. this event was lit and worth prolly more than a 10
We needed this!!!!! Shoutout to Dev 🤞🏽
Cel acts so different around Dev..
THANK YOU FOR POSTING YOUR A REAL ONE🙏🏻🔥
Word up !!
Nah yo, I’m jackin marcelas does coke
You are super clutch for this bro!!! I just bought a business and my financial situation is not great. I really wanted to buy it but, I have to have money left in case I need to pay. ( im a landscaper) thank you so much!!!
Good looks Dev…I know I wasn’t able to catch the creator classic soo I appreciate u dropping this for Us…keep doing what u do Bro it’s all love
I need that Hezi vs Uncle Skoob now
Best 1v1 I’ve seen.
Hesi traveled and fouled in the last min of the game. But respect to Friga for being respectful about it.
Thx for this my broke college self couldn't get a ticket
Pls drop the 2v2 and the dunk contest
come on HEZI u gotta contest these shots. Thats just plain lazy ass defense.
Stop playing with Friga 🔥
Thanks Dev we needed that one bro.
Cash better react to the full game, that last 1 with dev vs friga was kinda messed up, not reacting to devs 2 wins, when he turned up and started playing like himself,
Hezi lost....wow
couldn't get a ticket.... but the least I could do is watch them ads
This should have been hezi vs ksi then friga vs nick
Less go 🏀 🔥
What a legands dev is for giving us this
We need a YouTube basketball league. Dev needs to be the commissioner!!
That was definitely a travel 😂😂😂
Y’all should thank devin like Fr ❤️
Bro you’re the goat for this shit i wanted to watch so bad but couldnt buy a ticket. Thank you bro fr 🖤💯
Friga jump shot more of a one motion now too. I thought his form was perfect but now it’s perfect and pretty
Thanks for the one’s who are doing good right now and we’re be able to purchased it,thanks for not hating… y’all got to see it live right at the moments while we have to wait and hope that dev or somebody uploaded it, thank y’all for not hating and being humble specially cz y’all got a bit of money more than others
That was entertaining! Thanks for posting.
What about the dunk contest
He traveled his asssssss off
What a respectful victory for him. Nice guy beat villian hhh
Aint no wayyy hezi aint contested frigas jumpers🤧🔥🔥
Dev a real nigga much respect bro
Love the content dev, thanks for postin this vid
I don’t care about that legal shit just to say thank you for being humble and for your low income ppl that knows about y’all and and humblely watch y’all
Man dev you really are the 🐐 mad respect for putting the newer generation on like this!
Best event I seen in a long time everything was fire
Now we need the 2 s with dev and cell vrs friga and hesi
4:15 Hezi’s got Shaq’s shoes on. They are atleast 2 sizes too big. Stop and starting all the time he definitely has hammer toes. 🔨🦶
Resssspected🙏🏼💯✊🏽
Where was nick briz ? 😂🤡
Jay Jones will lock em all up
What shoes friga wearing
Hezi got more sizzle but Friga got more steak 🤷‍♂️ better overall player won in my opinion, but that was a hell of a battle. Run it back 🙏
You’re thee man. Thank you so much for putting this out!
I missed the Creator’s classic due to work reasons, I’m not asking for no hand outs.  Just want to know what was the score on the 2v2 and if Nelly did a good job representing the Asian community in basketball.  Anyone know where I can find that info?
That’s love dev thank u! 🔥💪
whoever recieved money how much of the 10k did you actually get
just want everyone out there to know...u cant please everyone. We gave away 10000 dollars .....free shoes..free shirts...and people complained about 10 dollars. No matter what u do...don't do it for credit..do things for the right reasons and everything else will fall in place
i love u dev
defensive jesus..... LOL
Friga's a real life "good guy" straight out of a book you have to respect him... love that dude man
" and i will not be posting this on YouTube"
Straight up 🔥💯💪🏽. Thank you to everyone involved. This is the YouTube basketball content that I crave (pause). Big respect to Friga, Hezi, Dev and Cel. Keep up the fire fellas 💯💪🏽
Really wanted to cop a ticket but down bad financially. Really respect this!!❤️
Amazing. I love both these athletes and I honestly thought hezi was gonna win. If it was a best of 5 or 7 series, I think hezi would've won majority. Dfriga showed awesome poise and confidence against an elite baller. Hats off to both and definitely had me on the edge of my seat for that last game 3 with jenna getting it crunk in there. Haha
Am I trippen y’all or does hezi play like lance Stephenson… it’s like his twin, just that hezi like 5’11
You gotta throw me in the next creator class tho..or yourrage
I didnt even know ppl be hating like that das crazy
The fact that they made this happen is legendary shout creator classic dev and cel and W friga💯 much love and support to ya
I had friga winning really wasn’t the underdog to me
Great video Dev 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
That almost-game winner at 5:00 is a big time travel. Gotta pull on that left foot if you pick up your pivot like that hezigod.. 🤦‍♂️ and I don't know how you travel in a 1v1 AND get the ball back 😂. Awesome fucking 1s tho. These guys can hoop for real !
Thank you dev! This is what I wanted
Broo u did this for the people shout out to dev bro u a real one
Such a W 1v1🔥
Supa hot fire 🔥
Good shit friga 😤 had my money on you good dub bro
Legends
Waste of money
Love it! Great stuff Dev🔥 You’re a real one!🤙🏼
I was the one buying people tickets!!!
yeessssuhhhh
What shoes hezi got on?
Imagine filayyy here
w
GGZ
BALL GAME!!! DAMNNNNN
Hezi definitely traveled. I slowed it down and he took 3 steps. But he got the ball back and scored so its coo. The first game had me thinkin Friga was gon drop him off easy but that second game GOT CRUCIAL! GG to both of yall 🔥🔥🔥🔥
those 5 dislikes can all go drift off in space lmao
lmaooo when cel said defensive jesus or sum
Nice guy friga smh.... You too nice frigo, this isnt a fairytale nice guys finish last in real life.. You should a won long ago
My guy Austin Mills cheesing the whole time in the back 😂 this shit was legendary!!!! Certified hood classic fr
I knew it 💪🏿 but good game Hesi you showed us you had a bag. Dfriga I see you bro.
Friga is the Tom Brady of YouTube basketball 😂
Man, Hesi God, I got u winning though. But that was amazing for sure. GG
I know how ball is and how it gets but when a mfer is 6ft and stops dribbling at the 3pt line and clear as day takes 3 steps and every mfer in that gym knows it was a travel. Why tf are they shooting for it? Its a RULE. Plain and simple. Or else fuck it just travel every play and try and get away with it if not hell just shoot for it right? Hezi is petty af to, that boy knows what a travel is and he knows his ass took too many steps and said that's a bucket... lol.
Dev a W for this🐐💯
Friga gotta call foul. Hezi would have 🤷🏽‍♂️
Friga let’s go
Thank you dev, it was a great event
Turn to Jesus people he died for your sins, Repent of what the New Testament describes as sin. Believe the gospel obey the teachings of Jesus documented in Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Jesus is the only way to be saved, be baptized if you have faith in Jesus then you will live life with him as your example. If you need prayer i'll pray for you. If you want to keep contact with a brother in Christ i’ll keep contact with you. The love of God is beyond our understanding. God bless..
Friga stop letting ppl walk over u in .. If u call something stand on it
