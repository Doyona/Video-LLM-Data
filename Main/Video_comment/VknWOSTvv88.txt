I miss grapple blade
I miss chapter 5 season 1 😢
How dare you  say the thermal scope is good its is sh$t
Yes
The enforcer er is back for chapter 3
the tremal shight sucks p2x was waaaaaaaayyyyyy better  like if you agree
But like a few weeks ago the hades chains came back🎉
I wish I started in version 19.10😭😭💔💔
no
Grapple blade is so much better   Than wings of Icarus
we need the havoc shotgun so bad
Im a og player like if you are og
All of this stuff is either fake or the most obvious stuff ever
Bring it back
No there’s one safe in the big house next to fencing feilds
fff
I hate the thermal scope the px2 optic is BETTER
I loved the 2px skope it was the best
7:04 I Prefer The Grapple Blade, Mainly Cause You Couldnt Get Shot Out Of The Sky As Easily
Chains of Hades are still in the game
there is actualy a safe at lavish lair inside a storage crate that you can only access via breaking the crate
Is there anyone here in 2025
I NEVER NEW THAT.
Can you friend me?
No  it.   Is.  Not
Chains of hades are still here wtf do you mean ? 1:00
oo
Can't be a secret if you know about it
I loved the grapple blade and i'm really sad it's gone from the game (hope it return's when we least expect it)
Safes appear at the little house outside of fencing😊
Crash pad jr's are still in the game
i agre @fire929rr7 its trash LLLLLLLL
There is a safe at lavish lair
Saves r still in fn js hard to find
The safes are still a thing I’ve found them in other places
grapple blade is probably my favorite fortnite item of ALL time,  it's the grapple gun (also one of my favs) with a cooldown instead of real uses and a back up melee with surprisingly good range, i picked it up every time, wings are bad imo, you get shotdown immediately almost every time, shockwaves are now the best mobility
None of this is "secretly" removed. It was just removed. 🙄
The cameras used to mark you when they were first added
When you get Oscar’s frenzy outo shotgun you will not see his name
Miniature faults are not only at that place I found one at the place  near fencing fields were you can add a character there is one there :)
Soooo… I’m gonna go refund my Jack skelington byeeee
The bananas being gone makes sense because during storyline the pot asks your favorite food durr burger banana and sometging else and banana was the correct answer
Xp still doesn’t work 😢
1:47 Nah I found one on the oil rig
Is the lock on pistol gone?
Family Guy Characters Are Gonna Be Removed
Ballistic shields were comfortable to deal with
safes are still in game
I personally prefer the grapple blade over the wings. At first the wings were great but now that ive actually used them, their not so great :/ but one good thing about the wings is it prevents you from getting fall damage
I didn’t know that 😮
yes
Bro is stating common sense
There are safes around the map I found 2 this morning
I have seen a safe by classy the train station south west from classy
or deadpool
Kratos is angry from seeing all the gods he had already taken care of running around emoting on him. 😂
nice map 6123-6998-2629
The safe information is incorrect. Found multiple while playing yesterday.
I don’t like the thunderbolt so I wish the graple blade replaced it
There is a safe on yacht
The vault is not useless. You can get in it with a glitch. It has a lot of things.
Hi oakley
Hi
Hi
Hi
The only thing I wanted to disappear was the frenzy
I found another mini vault?
The striker ar and hyper smg getting removed was kinda sad they were both pretty good and I feel like the harbinger (which feels like the replacement) has too much recoil
The Icarus wings are stupid because to can get beamed
saying that no one remembered the grapple blade is crazy, it was better than the wings
I found a safe at Lavish
😢😢no!!😭😭🤥🙏🤕
Safes are still here and not only there
Shield bubble jr is so stupid it is too small
There’s a safe at the house next to fencing feilds
Safes are still in fortnight I got one today
Each like this gets I will do ten push ups each like
I found a safe so that was a lie
I hate the dmr
i was playing fortnite a little bit ago and there are more mini vaults spread around the map not only that one in snooty
bro all your videos have peter griffin even if they don't include him 👎
I actuall came across one of the mini valts or safes at one of the locations.
I feel like the grapple blade should have stayed in along side the wings because of the wings having a certain amount to use
grapple blade is poggers
Wings are trash. Amazing mobility if you're not getting blown out of the sky. I stopped using them cuz i kept getting killed when i shouldn't have. Now I just spray wing users with my thunder burst and laugh as they plummet to the ground!
icris wings suck you get beemed
5:41 looks like fallout
Wdym? The safes are EVERYWHERE
Every like that this comment gets I’ll do one jump and jack
The striker, AR is in red vs blue
I’ve gotten a safe in fencing
Grapple blade is the best
btw vaults with gold are still here i found one yesterday
There are more safes around the map I land at this one place for ranked and there’s 100% spawn rate
ooh
Thank God they're just in the Pandora box
Clash pad jrs were op if you sprint before placing it you will be launched
There are safes in lavish lair still
I swear if I see a "i swear if i see a "i will do one push-up for every like" comment i will go crazy" comment i will go crazy
Fr the wings suck hard take
Where safes removed this week cause I have found a few around the map
THE STRIKER IS GONE
Things don't "vanish," they rotate out every season.  Are you new to Fortnite or something?  If so, why are you making videos about it?
You know, I’m really surprised even though they disabled creative XP I’ll just login the next day and I’ll get it.
4:19 this is amazing
Bro, they literally posted about the temporary removal of the Lego Raft Survival and Obstacle Course maps on the support account over a week ago. It's not hard to do a little bit of research.
Nooo Peter
Fortnite fumbled with the Cerberus motorcycle they should’ve made it a surf board instead of a shitty glider
Fortnite when it comes to making a good decision: 🧑‍🦯🧑‍🦯🧑‍🦯
Just for all of u guy the thing where the cameras mark u it was in the game when they first added them in chapter two
banana of the gods needs to be a real thing
People who knew true reason that the wings start burning 👇
I hate the wing cuz u get shoot down
I seen a safe yesterday
Ok I just found out that coconuts give you shield
i love this new season omgggg i literally played it and i SLAYED my first match 💅💅💅
The hades chain will come in a separate update like the solid snake things did
the anvill rocket luncher is finnally gone it would always pop out of a mythic chest like purple with cluster clingers
the anvil sucks
I like the grapple blade
5:25 “I am definitely surprised a useful weapon is gone” :) Yay no more purple anvil from the rare chests
I KNOW WHERE  TO GET WHERE TO GET GOLDEN SNIPER IT AT CLASSTY COURT BOTTOM LEFT HOUSE THERE IS A SECRET DOWNTOWN
dont thank me for the 6mil, u deserved it
The wings are good but people can spray at u
Yes the enforcer ar is soo bad thank epic games the DMR is way better
ima be honest i loved the crash pad jr i was cracked with those i loved glitching it to launch me a mile away 💀
you said wings are better than grappler? :))) look have you ever played rank or lobby without bots? :D
Wait I just realized something they don’t tell us, what if they kidnapped peely to summon the gods since peely is a banana
So they’re adding shield bubbles jr? What’s next a storm flip jr
Grapple Blade is better because if you use the wings then you just get beamed unlike the grapple blade.
The thermal sight sucks
There’s a safe at where meowcles the recruit is
1:53 nuh uh a place in between mounty olympus and restored reels call lil villa where u can hire meowscles in the second story in one of the rooms has amsafe in the corner
crash pads were great. idk why people didn’t like them
You can still found mini vaults in random houses
Bro the grapple blade will be replaced with chains of hades
The mod benches are in the safes that automatically open near end game, as well as one on the floating island
bring back the grapple blade!!!!!
you can get the 2x optic in go goated if tou have save it
❤
I find gold safes in rank all the time
Day 2 of asking for a Roblox vs Fortnite (UEFN) PLEASE
The striker is still in from drones
Keep on the great work
Erm u forgot fish coolers
I found bananas after this video was posted
Ig Some seasons have good and bad things
0:01 i farted
Safes are there at gas stations
I got 80,000 then I ran in the corner for a little while I’ll back out when I get 250,000xp
To be honest the shield bubble belongs in zero build
I hate they removed the grapple blade and give it the worst replacement.
Ur becoming matpat
Actually safes are also at fencing
Bro you are a w
There is still a gold vault by the bunker located by mount Olympics
safes are still in br
Now this may sound crazy but the grapple blade was WAY better for getting away and even attacking enemy while the wings just are so slow that I feel like people could just shoot me so easily. The grapple blade also got me around much quicker than the wings.
rizty was my fav
noticed all of them
He said supply cashes instead of combat cashes
3:40 it was bad anyway
I saw a mending machine where you yoused to buy random ninja turtles mythic underground so mending machines are true
i killed an entire lobby with the grapple blade
WINGS ARE SO BAD I HATE IT YOU LITERALLY GET SHOT THE AIR THEN YOU GO DOWN STRAIT AWAY
1:48 theres a safe in a gas station too!
The only thing nobody knows is Midas's return. the update right now is about gods and Midas is a god. So one of the rarest skins will come back
There's other places where safes are I have seen them around but in less locations
King Pelee is probably gonna be the boss. I just know it bro.
Somewhere in the map, there’s Midas’s door
Fortnite needs to be buffed 👇
I liked the grapple blade better it's so easy to get lazered and die well trying to escape a fight with the wings of icarus.
This is a spoiler but the new story quest actually leaked the banana because it asked what food the gods prefer and banana was the correct answer
T5G here’s something you might wanna add to a vid: if you look at Immortal Aphrodites Poseidon has a crush on her
THERES ALSO A SAFE AT MIDAS MANSION ON THE BALCONY
5:26 useful? That thing was trash 🗑️ you could tell when it would hit your car and just get out
I found safes at Other locations
Safes aren't all gone, safes spawn at the tall building on the island in the north
The grapple blade took less time to use but more time to recharge so I think the wings and the blade are as good as eachother
The anvil was never useful
They removed the anvil because it would be everywhere and all you can get out of a vault
I noticed theres no cars, safes are not gone and have seen them in other places than Snooty, and all the cameras are still there and now you get xp again for destroying them
The icarus wings are good but the grapple blade is better because with the wings your basically asking to be sniped
I’ve seen a bunch of safes still
rip old bananas 2019-2024
When does rocket racing update?
the ballistic shield wasn't even good
There is still a safe where midas’s chair was
...kratos has nothing to do with greek mythology... he's in a completely different pantheon
The sages are not in only in snooty I found some in a house but it was like a couple areas away so idk
the mini crash pads were insane????
So that's why i wasn't getting any xp from creative maps
thank god the shield is gone
4:05 they were boring tho
real
i miss the striker AR
The alternate modes cosmetics as part of the battlepass are a waste. It is to make you buy the overpriced ones. Do not give in. I almost would rather and emoticon over a guitar so they would lower the price of the instruments. They have no value and i dont want epic to think they do.
One sided shield fights bruh you must have been playing without sweats become the shield gets broken sk fast and i got eliminated in like 5 to 10 seconds by people unless im doing teams
Snooty steps is not the only place with safes left theres ones that can spawn other places like the lone mansion on the single island by where snake was
HELLLLLLLLLLLLLL NO THE GRAPEL BLADE IS 1000000000000000 TRILION TIMES BETER
Why didn’t you mention hazy hillside?
the riot sheild was the best
Fun fact in 1:40 there is gold safes in the new bunkers
Im glad the turrets are gone every noob that would pull up on me would throw it down and shred me
Safes also spawn in Pleasant Piazza
I actually don’t think it is not a good replacement because you can get lasered out of the sky
The chains mythic is purple
i miss grapple blade A LOT
I Think the part with sales being gone are Can cus ic Them everyother game
I feel like that’s not true. I’ve definitely gotten safe like every POI in the season.
I hate the wings
I still have the scope in go goated
Cameras are now clown detectors  change my mind
Midas is finally coming back, when you talk to jules, her description says something about her father's return
Grapple blade was the best, extremely underrated. Not just for zooming, but it was kind of incredible as a weapon, I’ll miss it ): Ngl wings are mid for damaging opponents and are ok for zooming around the map.
I hate new Fortnite bro
6:50 BRO THATS WHY IM PROGRESSING SO SLOW IN THE BATTLE PASS
go into the bunker to get alot of gold
safes is wrong, theres one in the cave nearby mount olympus with the cave of chests
They discontinued port a potty’s while I was in the secret cave, was a long grind to get out b4 dying lol
Anyone know what creative map that was at 6:43
Crash pad jr was a W better than shockwaves by 1000000x
Safes are still in the game, I found one outside of grand glacier
I like grapple blade
I found a safe on mount Superior and Pleasant Piazza.
are you kidding me, the enforcer AR was one of the best weapons ingame and the wings are great but I highly prefer the grapple blade since It makes you not even having to need a gun anymore ingame, thats how good they were
Can someone  gift me a skin plzzz Cause I don't have a single skin and i only have 200 v bucks in total
I think I have seen safes with gold in them at pleasant piazza I could be wrong though. Also I kinda miss the grapple blade because with the wings you can get shot down so easily, it's kinda annoying.
YOU FORGOT THE GRENADES
Btw the ship is called the marigold
I love crash pads now that ik how to use them u throw it at a hill and run down twords it with a flow berry
I got a sniper with the scope do they still spawn with them they were op with snipers
Bros got that miner cut
Congratulations on 6M subs T5G!!🎉
I could fight 2 whole squads with the grapple blade, the Icarus takes 4 dive bombs
1:45 thats not true, i've open one yesterday in a gas station
I litterly found a safe this morning
Congrats on 6M ❤
EPIC! If you're going to give us a product (Fortnite) make it fit for purpose. When there's snipers in the game, give us controller players sniper sensitivity on the settings, please.
Sad they ditched the grapple blade
Can you play fortnite without crossplay?  I am on PS4 and my wife is on PS5 and it forces us to keep crossplay on  But we just wanna play with PSN or console members   Do we have any options?
I LOVE YOU
grapple blade way better tbh
Hi) About safes - they are NOT missing, there is ALWAYS one on the western side in the left house at the beach, and in new POI (Olymp) one spawns sometimes)
Ive seen safes in multiple locations. This is cap
The thermal with The dmr is crazy
T5G I STILL HAVE THE 2x SCOPE IN GO GOATED!!!
I got to use the chains of Hades and they were so fun
There is one more safe by fencing field at the house that by the lake
guys suply cashes are still there, they just dont get pinged anymore, i saw one today
You can also grab the safe at gas stations
icarus wings are worse the flying is so slow
*1) Safes are everywhere* *2) Anvil launcher, cardboard boxes and crash pad Jr's were GARBAGE* *3) Weapon caches were GARBAGE, Business turrets actually were great distractions* *4) New season Icarus wings are OP*
Hey top5gaming i dont know if its like old or not but the secret chest cave in the snow area with the coral buddies now has coral trees and a boat inside
I like the wings and I think they are better than the grapppe blade, but it is so annoying because they are super common and half the lobby is flying around.
Fencing Fields and where Hazy use to be that House where you can use 250 gold to Hire the Cat, theirs always a Safe in the 2nd Floor Room
i saw the cars in battlepass thingy since the new season came out
The wings are trash bro💀
Not to mention the bunkers open up
The safest are random.. and caches are still in the game
There is also another safe where You Can buy The meowsels NPC
The crash pad jr where not bad guys it's was decent
TAKE OUT THE FUCKING BOLTS
The safe one is a lie i found a safe today
Grapple blade is better than wings in my opinion
There’s also loads of other saves, but just not in main POIS
I did the the trash can wings glitch b4 it was patched
yeahhhhh cameras have always marked you..
ive found the gold vaults multiple times i dont think thier gone and i dont go snooty steps so they might be in game
Literally no one liked anvil launchers
Belief in jourself I hope jou get fames
Did you know you can question meowscles about midas
I came from tik tok cry about it
I can't stress enough how appriciative we are. If it wasn't for your amazing levels of perception nobody, nobody, would have spotted these SECRETLY removed things /s
Fun fact cameras always marked you so yeah nothings changed with the mechanic
Congrats on 1 million views in 18 hours
The safes are wrong theres a safe at one of the windmills
the grapple blade is way better than the wings
I hope they keep the flying for a long time
🎉 Congrats 🎉 on 6M subscribers Tommy , one day you'll get that sweet sweet diamond play button ❤️
im sad asf, they removed p2x scope tbh, i really liked it.
The grapple blade was better for sure more damage even if it wasn’t that good of mobility at least it DOSENT breaks or drop you mid flight! I NEED THE GRAPLE BLADE!!! 😤
7:11 i loved grapple blade but the wings are a good replacement
At least you can get something other than anvil launchers In epic chests
damn 6 mill subs bro you popping tf off
Now if they can fix their severs im lagging and glitching after the new season went live.
I'm alrdy max gold
Ok im at the sheild part you say their gone but i was on all day yesterday and  i saw a few throughout my matches
justice for the grapple blades
Thanks to fornite turning off creative map xp I'm plat 1 for the first time 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
say goodbye to chapter 5 season 2 👇
Convinced this guys have never played fortnite the wings suck
Maybe jack skellington will come back with the new Disney crossover
The anvil launcher is the worst gun and it's not even that useful
Season 2  total  EPIC FAIL......  two thumb's  down!
Quick notice: there’s still a safe in the secret cave!!  Also, there’s still a working portapotty by the oil rig.
No i like the wings the grapple blade is better
Dap doo doo doo dap doo doo doo
Congrats on 6m subs!!!
i love you t5g but you are very wrong the grapel blade is so much better than the wings because the wings count as your hit box and you have to fly up high to get through builds which 1. easily get beamed 2. its bad for tournament because players have good aim but with the grapel blade you can move down on low ground
There us still a working porta potty in the secret cave 🤫
The mod benches are also gone
Valeria is still on the map I talked to her yesterday about the Society the Underground and her sister
Crash pad juniors were so useless last season. If you agree 👇
Safes are just in Snooty. I’ve found them elsewhere on the map.
i dont want to be that person. But with Save the world you could have got xp. Hell i got to level 20 in 2 days with out no money also i got the battle pass with the v buck i got from save the world
Midas Is Gonna Be Peak 🔥
I kinda liked the Striker AR….
the anvil is a metal gear collab item
safes are everywhere in the map
bro fudge off the grapple blade was sooooo much better
i swear EVERYONE calls items a mythic when it’s actually epic rarity 😭
Why Jack sellinten 😢
What happened to peely
Umm I found a safe at a gas station?
My theory about Midas is that his golden reboot card in the underworld will have a golden reboot van in the yacht vault
i think fortnite is making it dead (kinda)
bro the grapple is way better than icarus wings
You can get safes at lavish???
the reason cars were there is because peter griffin didnt have a second style
Ummmm I found a gold striker at pleasant yesterday😐
i want my graple BLADE BACKKKKK
theres also s afe near the boat next to yhe wind tubines in the water but i dont think its 100% spawn tho
The best part: 5:23
For context for this season the icarus wings are a cool idea but it makes me miss the grapple hook alot, you're way too big of a target with the icarus wings. But at least the Thunderbolts aren't strong like the Deku Smash which destroys all challenge of build mode n went from funny to use to very annoying in the past so the thunderbolt is a better replacement.
Safes are still in the game..
The wings suck, since their part of your hitbox. If you get sprayed, you can count on dying
The wings are so much better then the grapple😂
Safe appears at the big lake house by fencing fields
I’ve found  safes 🤔
I don’t like the wings, grapple blade and turtle mystics were so much better
Tbh the wings are not good cuz u get get sniped easily like it’s impossible to miss a shot when someone is using the wings
Grapple blade is life
Hey tg5 just saying the yacht Is leaving it has moved since last season
i will be so mad if kartos comes back i am going to quit
Bro, two weeks school was better than the thermal scope. It was not a literal good replacement.
5:24  a “useful weapon” has been vaulted
There's still safes all around the map
I didn't hate the whip in certain situations. It was an awesome counter to the ballistics shield.
Snooty steeps is not the only place where you can get a safe
Safes are in gas stations too!
Safes are also in another POI that I landed out all the time that I call hospital in the top right corner of the map
Yes
You can get a guaranteed gold safe on a small house on a lil house to the right where soild snake was
Grapple blade was goated
The blade could've been useful for getting closer to the people hiding out in buildings or the bunkers that wont make much sense to bring in the wings for.
Caches were too good
Ik why they added the business turrets and lock on pistol and anvil, cuz last season was like a spy, war, agents season between the underground and the society
Congrats on 6mil!
I actually played a ranked game 2 days ago at snooty and shot a drone and it dropped a gold striker ar. I was confused cause I thought they were vaulted and they were but I somehow got one in a ranked game
Disclaimer the anvil rocket launcher was removed as part of the Metal Gear collab
How do u get the hades chain whip
Actually no, there is another usable safe at the secret cave 😉
MHM WAT MAP IS THAT AT THE START MAP CODE PLS
i just opened a safe at a gas station.
Why remove the chain of hades? I hope it gets added later🙏
Safes are still in the game
grapple blades are better then the wings
Ok but let’s be honest the striker was goated the spray on it is crazy. If you mod it with the right things it’s straight up broken.
1:55 there is a safe in a house next to fencing fields
Tommy there is also gold safes at lavish lair
If you ran into the Crash pad jr then it whould send you flying
The only positive things I can say about Season 2 are the skins and the thermal attachment. The rest is garbage.
About the mini safes there is one more at the end of the map near Stooty Steps
most of the stuff that he said has been removed hasn't,  the safes are still in the game the bananas and the ballistic shield is still in the game
Did they bring back the battle royale map to creative???
New season garbage
No way you said the anvil was "super useful"
I think the Icarus Wings are great vehicle, but the Grappling Hook is the better weapons.  I can't count how many times I've eliminated using it in Zero Build.
sometimes videos like these make me realize how stupid fortnite players are sometimes
One more thing about the yacht it’s actually flipped itself and been took over by shadow
Your actually wrong. Safes with gold can also spawn in lavish lair
There is a miniature vault in a shed beside the Artemis NPC
1:53 I’ve seen plenty of chests
If you use the icurus wings sometimes you get a camera glitch and you get 100% acc shooting someone using it.
Next thing we know shockwave grenade junior
Is it possible for Rocket racing to have its own mini pass??
I never got the mythic my friends always took them 😢
7:05 Grapple Blade was good
6:15 The SMG still exists
Wings are cool n all, but im rocking with shockwaves. Them and bunkers spawn so much more in zb, and the wings make you so easy to get shot out.
I was the 2nd like
do the biggest emoji spam ever😁
7:30 my guess is because when you hit someone with lightning bolt they turn into a skeleton so his clothes would disappear for a second
Story line
The thermal is trash
I found safes at reckless
By the way l know remove not secret because u made video
So will the hades mythic ever return
there are still safes in the gas stations around the map, like the one west of the entrance of rebuilt reels
Tommy you will never have the voice of typical gamer lol WHY the fake voice it’s  so wired when you have bin live , sort this out be good at your job or be quiet 🤫
I'm Happy the anvil is gone because it was so annoying to open a Mythic Chest only for it to be an anvil rocket launcher. Probably the most useless item in The Game IMO. I am really sad The Striker Is Gone though. It was My Favorite AR Last Season, But The New AR Is also Really Good. Also, Just wanted to say that Safes Aren't Gone. I found one Earlier at the house near Fencing Fields where Meowscles is. And The Grapple Blade was really useful In My Opinion, But The Wings are probably better, I just kind of wish Epic had kept them both because The Wings are Great, But they're a little hard to get the hang of sometimes and they have a limited amount of use.
'Secretly removed...' 😂
Under 10 hours 👎🏻
1:52 there’s a gold safe that spawns at the rainbow rentals
Something that's also missing is a lot of Vbucks from the main pass, most are now in the bonus pass
How do "last season's bosses" make the list of secret(!) removals? they are always gone next season EDIT: same for the collabs in general; but then again the title just clickbait-ish; wish you would have simply sectioned the video into things that got more or less secretly removed, the regular changes between seasons, and other noteworthy changes I am rather surprised when weapons actually make it to the next season; for example the enforcer was replaced with the dmr; it was an assualt rifle but due to the fire rate you could basically not use it in close combat and just mod it to expand the usability to high range
Safes are at a lot of gas stations too and other places still
Jeff
The porta potty in the cave in between brawlers battle ground and grand glacier
Fun fact if you go in creative that you can buy or get mythics from last season you can still use the 2x scope with grand glaciers mythic
I landed at the mansion north of Lavish Lair and there was a safe
The wings are not good,If you play competitive everyone has aimbot and your hit box using the wings is doubled
Bro want the anvil rocket launcher back 💀
Tommy you can find safes at any non Greek poi
I stopped using the wings after the first day. The fact that getting shot on the wings damages you, its really easy to be killed while flying. My aim is bad at range but its easy for me to take out someone with a pistol when theyre flying
I have found safes all over the map so I guess you have bad luck finding them
I’m two days into college
one thing that will never stop bothering me is cosmetics that are only usable with a specific skin. looking at you mjolnir. i paid for it i should be able to use it however i like :(
Anyone else feel that the old boss pois have the only reason we dropped there taken away?
The supply cashes still exist in team rumble
They could’ve took away the emp grenade or these other bomb slot holders and replaced them with og stuff, so they don’t have to milk the og thing and can combine the old with new.
I’ll miss the grapple blade, I noticed it was gone. I feel like it was one of the staples of chapter 5 when it first came out, just for them replace it with an item that most likely will vanish by season 3 as well.
there are more safe acoos the map
There are other safes
Uh I will miss the graple blade
Safes and bananas aren’t gone? I was playing a few hours ago and found both.
The Wings of Icarus are SO BAD they are so useless that I don't even want to pick them up they are more of a damage dealer then they are an escape tool
As far as I'm concerned with the new season so far: All the mythics are fine basically as-is, except maybe change the scope on Zeus's DMR Same with the medallions this season, they're all fine rn as well I feel the only other changes I'd probably make are to keep the mod benches in the old boss zones (Snooty, Grand, Fencing, Reckless, and Lavish) instead of forcing people to rely on the bunkers scattered throughout the map And also to maybe buff the Icarus Wings just a little bit, I feel like it's way too easy to be shot down with them being in use, but other than that they're a pretty solid mobility item that can also function as a divebomb attack But other than that, I think this season's gonna be a pretty great one, hopefully we see Kratos return without any issues, possibly even with a new "young" style to show off his original look, too.
huh
I think the wings are really cool but also really underwhelming. Grapple Blade was a dangerous weapon in the right hands and if i had the grapple blade with the wings i would be an absolute menace. Same way i was last season with the Ballistic Shield, Grapple blade, one of the turtle mythic, and the lock on pistol. Really great combo
Also a poi beside the snow biome mountain is gone
The health regen was useless
Safes are still in the map they just spawn less
Coolers
Cars are way more useful, instruments are useless.
NOT U MENTIONING MY FAVORITE PLACE IT HURTS MY RITZY WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
Damn this makes the season even worse😂 and these are the reasons I hate this season .the medallions suck .the battle pass is mid .all the kids spray .the mythics are Dookey bootey😊
Hazy hills is gone to tho
I was looking for the cars in the battle pass hoping it wasn't in there
I liked the grapple blade more than the icrus wings😢
Legit every person who’s used the Icarus Wings against had died.. That includes me 💀💀
hazy hillside is gone too 😢
I think that the wings are a good replacement for the grapple blade but the thing is that I liked  the grapple blade  just because of the uses you can get over and over
It s funny noobs use business but in reality only sweats use it
I was a little mad when the grapple blade left but I definitely like the wings too
did you know when you pickaxe someone with cerbeus pickaxes it says sliced i don't know if it's now with every pickaxe
I saw a safe at fencing fields
So were not getting hades chains anymore😢
Blud the wings are much worse than the grapple blade 😂😂😂 the wings count as your hit box free kills
yout lying i found a safe at the underworld 10 minutes ago
fortnite adding almost everything new to the new chapter only to remove and replace it the next season:
i was wondering what happened to the mythic we swaw in the trailer. (I also told my frind before seeing the trailer that hades chain mythic is gonna be like a harpoon gun pulling people in but theres a special melee attack)
theres a safes at plesant plizza
Who agrees that we need the guided missile back lol
The wings are not a good replacement. I love that thingy I can tell you why it’s because you can literally get closer to them and literally does pretty much a lot of damage which is why it’s not a good replacement. Well the aren’t that bad since they can make you fly and go faster and you can also slam it’s okay
Grapple blade is so much better then wings what are you yapping about
"A useful weapon has been vaulted for no reason the Anvil" That feeling when you open a rare chest just to get a anvil 😔
Top5Gaming, there is a safe in pleasant piazza
You can also find a safe in the secrets coral cave
Actually the mini safes are still around in different places and there still is teleport portappties
Ritzy Riveria was one of my fav drop spots because of the vault and weapon cases
38 MINUTE GANG
Brother the miniature is strong
Sad because my PS4 doesn’t work no more and I can’t afford ps5, can’t play Fortnite
idk if this is for other people too but i have not received my 1500 vbucks from completing last seasons battle pass. did they remove that or smth. i haven't found anyone else having this problem except my brother who also completed the battle pass. can anyone help me out?
WDYM THE 2X SCOPE IS GOOD I USED IT IN MY SNIPER
grapple blade is not bad but not that good but usefull for travelling
Lil bro do your research a little bit there is a safe in the basement g house outside of fencing fields
A safe also appears in the Coral Cave/Loot cave. A porta Potty can also be used to bet into said cave so this vids wrong twice
i saw a mini vault not in snooty
Please don’t judge but I kinda liked the business turret
Congrats on 6 mil 🎉
I like the grapple blades better, it also countered the riot shield perfectly
Why did they have to remove the P2 X scope like come on people actually like that one unlike the one with the circle in the middle of it with the dot I don’t know I forget what it’s called
I don't know why so many people hate the crash pad jnr. It was so good for quick rotations with the sprint jump bounce, and I got so many clips of sprint bouncing into people's boxes and one pumping them
Good riddance for the anvil rocket launcher
Does anyone else’s game crash on Xbox series while playing battle royale for no reason?
there are lot of safes all over the maps bro u haven't checked properly😂
I like the grapple blade better because it was better for my endgames and you can’t get beamed
*harbinger*
Bananas are in the game lol
I found a safe at grand glacier
Nooooooooo! Not the bananas!😢
bring back the  p2x optic
the Icarus wings are highly overrated like it's so easy to get shot out of the sky.
fire video
This is really cool to hear that somthings gone
grappler blade was way better
I actually preferred the grapple blade it was easier to move without getting shot the wings are easy to get hit with
The thermal scope they replaced the 2x scope with is actually mad good
Ngl Fortnite need to make a Fortnite Collabs with one punch man there could be a one punch mythic which would be overpowered and they would be Saitama geno and garou and more mythic‘s like Geno’s  cyborg arms and Garoua moves Who actually they should also add taskinami (sorry if I spelled her name wrong) and more
Yeah, no one noticed that there's no cars on the bp, thank you for letting us know.
I’m kinda aggravated the grapple blade is gone, bc it was great for movement, and the wings are bad due to people easily getting beamed
There are still safes around the map they are just rare
Fortnite gave me a survey about the banana and I said it was to overpowered and then epic vaulted it 😭🙏 my bad gang 🫸🫷
Are you saying the anivil rocket launcher is good?
Safes are also still at lavish lair
they also removed the grappler
Huh bro is never lookin out for safes I guess... not only in Snooty for suuure
🤑
5:25 the anvil rocket launcher only came because metal gear solid did so it got removed with the emp
Bro really said a useful item… “the anvil” 😅
I'm sad the grapple blade is gone, it's one of those weapons that helped you figure out if your playing with a noob or someone experience. Noobs often freak, well the experienced player would just pull out a shotgun.
Id dather them removed the auto shotgun than the balistic shield, the shield could be easily countered sith the grapple bladez making them almost useless when people use em but the auto shotgun is too strong, its like each shot is a pump shotgun and being able to é or 4 shot players with a gun like that shouldn't be a thing
While I like the Icarus wings  The grapple blade is a great melee weapon if you know how to use it and it can’t be compared to the Icarus wings imo
quick tip for crash pad jrs if you sprint and jump then place a crash pad jr, it will send you flying  (ive tried this and it works 100%)
3:19 my first win was here it’s so sad to make it say goodbye :(😢
The graple balde was si much better you cant say no to infinito mobiliti
thank god anvil is gone i was getting an anvil rocket launcher every legendary chest
The grapple blade was so good for comp
Icarus Wings are way cooler!
1:50 wrong I found one at the junk yard next between reckless railways  cell tower and Mount Olympus
No the wings are bad
I'm sad the striker ar and grapple are gone
Today i just came back to Fortnite after over four years
I loved the grapple blade. I was hoping the Hades whip would be the updated version, but I guess it's just gone 🤷
4:38 why are you saying it like the striker is bad, its the best AR
I loved caches I. Chapter 4 season 2. But without variety’s and slurp juice they’re pointless  JUSTICE FOR TURRENT
Chapter 4 caches are better
no
I loved grapple blade, and I'm sad it's gone
I’m glad the vending machines that sells weapons and ammo are back
The wings are good but if someone shoots you while you are flying it’s like they have aimbot 😂
There is a safe at little villa still!!!
It’s the only named
It’s actually wrong as there is safes in places other then snooty
I hate the removal of grapple blades, there is pretty much no good movement in ranked any more, everytime you use the wings to get around you simply get lazered out of the sky, and shockwaves are so hard to find and if you get a full stack of them you only have six, not to mention the lightning bolt of zeus is the most annoying item in the game.
Icarus is not a mythic, Wings of Icarus are an epic item.
Nah because the wings get shot out of the skie in 5 seconds
This guys entire script is written by AI.  I swear most of what he says doesn't make any sense.  I don't know where he gets his opinions from.  Tommy. Hire someone to write your scrpits.
I found a safe at mount olypus
There is also a safe where meowscules is in the second floor of that house
Wings=trash Grapple Blade=W
i absolutely Love Both the Grapple Blade and the Wings, I would really like them both ingame such a shame.
Congrats on 6 mil!🎉
I’m kinda mad about the chains, but hopefully we get them soon! Congrats on 6M!!
The crash pad jr became so useful in season 1 I liked ot
grapple blade is not better than the wings idk what ur talking about
Bro what? The grapple blade was WAY better than these stupid wings
I’m glad I got to play with the whip in team rumble, I was just trying to do some quests when I found it
6 mil!!!
Bro safes I find them everywhere
2:41  I was so so surprise
I liked the grapple blade, it was almost always in my inventory. Last season I switched my usage loadout to allow me more mobility (I don’t like driving the cars). I think the blade was useful but could’ve been improved. The wings of Icarus, I really like and them seem really balanced. Personally, I just wished the base speed was just a fraction faster
need to get rid of the wings and bring the grapple blade back now
Uwu
congrats on 6mil tommy boy
1:47 j got one a pleasant piazza
Keep talking about my god of war Kratos, I just hope epic sees it

6:20. Did he just say Vuliuriuh
No
On
I find gold safes everywhere lol so they are not gone
No the grapple was way better because it’s so much easier to shoo someone using the wings and the grappler would take so much precise shooting that’s why the grappler is better
eyy what? I've seen the safes where I usually find them still
the graple blade and the wing are both super good
4:39 I liked this version though, sure it wasn’t the og one, but it still was much better than the nemesis, and it was tied with the enforcer in zero build for its tap fire damage Edit: tbh, I don’t like the Icarus wings that much, the fact that the wings are part of your hit box when you’re using them makes you very vulnerable to snipers, and if you’re high in the air, you’re a free elim waiting to happen if you get hit enough
Hell nah get that anvil rocket lanucher outta here, whenever you got a vault, you were garaunteed to get a purple anvil from the god chest.
Most of this is lies u haft to be better man
Safes are still around u haft to look also they are adding chains of Hades they are just updating the things
this season is gay
I did say (to myself) when greek is released i was gonna beat zeus's ass as kratos and then i noticed his face
Turret would be the perfect counter to zyes
I saw a safe where the Skye NPC is
nah i found a lot of use out of the crashpad Jnr to launch at players. When you're in the air, double tap the space bar and it auto deploys a crash pad and then you could bounce onto enemies, it was OP and i won many games from it
i kinda wish grapple blade was kept, it was nice having a pretty tame mobility item. Ares’ wings are not a replacement, they are a cover up.
7:14 I've seen people move further into a turret's effective range rather than try to get out of it and shoot it from a distance. It's not that hard to counter if you keep a level head.
No, the grapple blade was most definitely better
The crash pad Junior was good in one way, the one way being if you sprinted and use you get sent 100s of meters
they needed to add motorcycle skin in the game like car did
1000th comment  nobody cares
I always love this stuff but now I'm sad they removed it😢
Wait they removed the safes because earlier today I opened a safe at pleasant piazza
Yes. The 1k comment.
1 Like = 1 sit up
Hey, um, good question, what happened to a party royal
Honestly my least favorite season so far. It feels all the items are super powerful, the zuse mythic kills through walls, and I hated the weapon mods to begin with.
Most of these weren't secretly removed, either epic or leaks said everything being removed + added the day before the season came out.
Who likes the new update 👇
Remove frenzy please
The Wings of Icarus are probably the only mobility I wish would stay. They're perfectly balanced; you can use them to engage a fight, maybe even knock someone to fall damage, and they let you go anywhere you want with the easiest to use controls we've had, but on the flip side they are also not something you can just use to disengage a fight just because its not going in your favor like you could with the Grapple, ODM, Plunger, and Shockwaves, and they have a massive hitbox so you aren't as unhitable as the Cloud/Broom. That's how you properly balance something
Bros the type of guy to think the wings are better than the grapple blade
Medkit jr.💀💀💀💀
Also the free ranked skin is not free it’s in the item shop
Safes are still in the game what?
Im sad they took ritzy rivera the mountain that it had was my favorite drop spot so i was really confused when it got deleted, like there are some other POI they could have deleted kther zones and they deleted that one, i know at least someone would be sad for they're favorite POI getting deleted, but they could just add the new POI's as a new part of the island..
There is a safe at the underworld
Me personally, I loved the striker. Its honestly one of my favourite ARs, but they removed it 😢
wings = caseoh: bird form
The Icarus wings are glitchy I fell to my death without touching the ground with them
CONGRATS ON 6M SUBS!
love that business turrets are gone so annoying and the wings were a good replacement for grapple blades
4:35 both of these people hate the ballistic shield
The business turret was nice though. It was not that common and pretty easy to counter with the shield and you could put a turret against a turret and you can only use one at a time.
Half of these thing are wrong and half of these thing are so obvious
I don't really mind that the grapple blade is removed it was a good item
Congrats on 6 million subscribers bro keep up the grind
6 MILLION SUBS, how much $$ you rakin' in my dude??
O
Kratos is not happy that zeus (zoos) is back
Safes are still in the game
3:00 damn now how am I gonna feed my crippling healing addiction
Safes are still in all places
"the power to spray and pray" I felt that
If you miss the Lego obby                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   👇
The reason the anvil launcher is gone it’s because it was part of the snake collab
Early🎉
The grapple blade is better because u didnt get beamed everytime u used it the grapple blade suppieror
Dang bruh
grapple blade so much better than wings
Grapple blade would be OP against the Wings since you can grapple onto people.
The reason why shields were so hated was bc people would just camp corners making it impossible to send them back to lobby bc u need to shoot them from behind to send them back to the lobby
The grapple blade should have stayed so you could do something like pulling wings out of the sky Ngl
are u sure about the safe? me and my friend were playing yesterday and opened one in a different poi
We’re you born on a highway cause that’s we’re most accidents happen there
Are the Chains of Hadies even in the game at all right now?  Haven't seen a single one, only lightning bolts and wings honestly this season feels more baron than the last removed a little too much
There’s safes at gas stations tii
The balistic shield was so op, I won a game only using it
Fish coolers are also removed, can't find them anywhere even in 100% spawn places
I am glad the shield is gone
So that’s we’re the chain of headies went
Number 7 is wrong, there are safes all over the map like in Pleasant Piaza.
They're completely incorrect about safes being removed. There's more than just the one safe they mentioned. They're still all over the map, but there are fewer than last season I believe.
all hail the only fortnight youtuber that dosent take 45 minutes to say four words this man is a gift honestly he can summarize an entire season in one paragraph.
Talk to hope at Grand glacier for info on the society. Plz
For some reason I feel that grapple blade better than wings cause wings are not unlimited but grapple is
Dude the grapple blade was so much better for ranked and trying to get away
Did we revert back to the old movement? Idk why but it feels like it
1:45 wrong There’s also one at that house in the middle of the map with the buff cat
I AM ZEUS  👇
I got sooooooo many kills with the AR / lock pistol combo last season.  😢
What the heck? I saw the safe in the cave
There is another gold safe south of Classy Courts.
the reason i hate the anvil launcher is simple, imagine you find a rare chest, your excited obviously since you will get a guaranteed epic weapon, but image my surprise when every time i found this chest i got a fkn anvil launcher in epic rarity, like my guy you could find this commonly in regular chests and floor loot but im pretty sure the only rarity it came in was epic so you were not even getting a better version and it overall sucked, so glad they are gone
K ratos is angry because the gods are back that’s my theory
I’ve found safes in several other locations and have used the dumpster to hide?
Personally i love the grapple blade and hate the wings because i mostly play ranked and i just get shot out of the sky
there is a safe is the house with meowscles\
I didn't realise that the grappleblade was back to be honest
I find safes everywhere they're not out
I hate the wings
5:00 legit was eating a banana when this came up LOL
Ah yes only snooty steppe, my friend right as he said that in a random house “ it’s a safe”
Safes are NOT removed, I opened several last night.
w grapple
Under 1 Day Gang!!!11!! 👇
I love  your  video
grapple blades were better
Genuinely hate that the wings replaced the Grapple blade. They increase your player hitbox, suck at rushing, can feel pretty slow compared to other methods of travel, aren't sustainable, have a useless dive bomb attack and you're pretty much dead if you accidentaly use them in a fight. The grapple blade was by no means a perfect way to get around but in all honesty it was a lot better than the wings. It was sustainable for movement, good for rushing, had a slightly more useful attack, could grapple onto pretty much anything, didn't increase your hitbox and you still had a chance of winning a fight if you accidentaly used them. Personal opinion but I know people who prefer the wings over the blade.
Thought this was supposed to be secret things removed not pretty obvious stuff that you could read in patch notes or play two games and find all this out. L
Sheild Bubble Jr. is gonna be really helpful. Leakers used Zeus' Lightning on it and it blocks all 3 bolts, meaning you could just box up throw one down and be invincible. Also being very helpful for end games when people are rushing you because they'll have to be in your box to fight you.
Safes are still in the game I found one in my other game
There is also safes in every bunker
supply drop drop at random which can change the game up and give you a win even at 50 health no shelds 🥳
Crash pad Jr are good
8:23 Anvil Rocket Launcher was vaulted because it was part of the Metal Gear crossover
See I don't understand crash pad jr.s, but a junior shield bubble would be so good for zero build
Look into the file you will see a shield bubble Jr.
WINGS ARE ASS BRING BACK GRAPPLE BLADEEEE
Hello, the only reason that the anvil rocket launcher is gone is because it was apart of the solid snake collab, it is a weapon in the game and is even one of his moves in smash bros
I never stopped watching this channel. Not even when i stopped playing fortnite lol. (Started watching in like s7)
Seen this a bit, but yeah safes weren't removed from the game I believe they lowered spawn chances for anyone wondering
I think the Icarus is easier to get beamed I liked grapple blade more
Glad Peter griffin is gone it’s old as heck
I found a safe last night. They're still in the game
That's cap I hid in a trash can yesterday
No
5:24 thank God they removed it. I swear in every golden chest you open there was one of them. I dint even wanted to open them. 😭
Good that the cars are gone from the battle pass, now they need to get rid of the instruments and give us just BATTLE ROYALE stuff in the BATTLE pass. Put that other overpriced crap elsewhere where we don't have to see it.
There's still safes, I just found one at the beach house on the west coast of the map
Well the hyper smg lasted only two days and fortnite secretly removed it
There is a glitch do get under the map with a car and a bunker
Congrats on 6 million subs!
Ai tick wuil be a troll picus is almost April
I will do 1 comment for every push-up this comment gets!!!
The TMNT location was so awesome    Sadly it’s already gone
I used a porterpotty just outside rebel roost yesterday took me back in there
Like this if u like this season
The striker AR was amazing i was so mad to find out its gone
I always called the striker AR the scar since it’s so similar
Cap the little vaults are near the lake the house with meow schools
I did notice the cars in the battle bass
pretty sure the map of the train route at reckless is still not updated for new season 2:35
Wrong there is gold safes and the house behind lavish
I think the mythics like thunderbolt and chain are gonna rotate throughout the season e.g. Zeus Thunder then that goes and we get hades chain then Cerberus claws, Artemis bow, avatar water, posiden trident. Then at the last few days os the season we get them all in at once. 😀
Valeria is still on the map but she is in a different location
If the change to Kratos' face and Hades whip being removed until later doesn't point to him getting a young Greek Kratos style, idk what does.
Bro is just going to milk the living crap of Fortnite
Bro just explained why this season sucks
I’m pretty sure I saw him when he was talking about the camera change
safes can still be found around the map not just snooty steps
7:11  the icorus wings when you use them you get sniped so often so when we getting the blade back
Who knows how to stop scoping with the thermal scop
Are you posting daily now
The only bad thing about the wings is that you get shot out of the air so easily
When I was in a game I go the the hyper smg
5:24 did he just say Anvils were useful?
1 hr gang
I was surprised when I got the hades chains and it is an ok weapon, pull enemies and whack em for 35-40 damage
The house where meowscles is has a safe too
You missed one sniper's are now easier to find
I found a safe in a gas station yesterday😂
Anvil Was NOT useful
They are Sace at more places
How many more people keep mentioning Midas
They are more
Personally i preferred the Grapple blade. yes the wings are better for mobility. but they make you a MUCH bigger target. not to mention dont work with the movement power coins. ontop its much harder to actually use them to do damage though that probably was only me on the grapple blades anyways xd. Generally speaking though...they cant be compared as the ussage is much to different. The Blades where a Consistent Movement melee weapon. the Wings Are a inconsistent Movement Flying Explosive weapon
There is another sage I don't remember where it is but the still is another
Instruments: W Cars: L
Im still bit getting exp bro and i leveld up 30 but i lef tto lobby im level 27 broooo
Nahhh these superpowers in Fortnite needs to go. The opponents keep running away 😂😂😂
Chains of hades were removed because its meant to be released later ❤
Btw the tmnt music is still playing in rebels roost
On the first day of fortnight this seson I was playing team rumble and seen so manny supply drops but didn't open them sadly
1 hour gang
the one about safes is wrong
There are definitely safes in this season, opened a few!!
dude i loved the crash pad jr why do yall hate it
Anvil rocket launcher was also part of the metal gear collab
I feel like the grapple glove could have reskinned it and could have both wing and grapple glove.
And I have to touch grass is 😂😭
i literally got a striker AR in this season it was legendary. so are they really removed or they are just very rare?
I can’t play the game because I am on my grandmas and she doesn’t live in my state and I can’t bring my console
W
I freaking loved the grapple blade it was so fun grappling on to enemy’s and then attacking how ever the wings are a huge down grade first of it increases your hitbox making so much easier for enemy’s to hit and when you plunge you have to be directly on top of enemy’s to actually hit and they don’t even do that much damage but that’s just my opinion also I play zero build
I wish there was cars in the battle pass this season
A shield bubble jr is a good idea because it’s smaller meaning less noticeable
I’m glad of the update on cameras cause it actually makes them bad
You can combo the Grable blade, icoris wings and Cerberus Madeleine for dumb distance
I  HAVE A THEORY THAT ODDYSEY IS THE AGELESS
Congrats on 6M subs🎉
why would they remove the chains of hades bro that would be sick
they need to balance the lighting bolt thing
The mod bench are in the bunkers
What do you think could be next?? Maybe storm flip jr. ( smaller growth radius) or maybe something even cooler like Alien Nanite Jr. (the size of a singular 1X1 Box )??  What would you guys like to see a jr. version of if they make this a trend.
wings are better
Imo the  icaurous (or however you spell it) wings are really fun to use but kinda suk XD great rotation but u can’t use it to push or escape because you just immediately get shot to death ); in ranked I carry shockwaves cuz whenever I have the wings I always die XD
Personaly I like the grapple blade more than the icoris wings
Dang I keep getting checkmated
i hated the anvil rocket launcher they where hogging all the mythic chests :*)
It lets me play survival raft😊
Here before 200k views
I prefer the enforcer ar than the new DMR honestly
Dude the p2x gun part at the bench literally helped so much with the reaper sniper rifle
safes are still in game. easy to find as well
5:24 bro did not just say no reason
That thing about SAFES is ABSOLUTELY NOT TRUE... Right next to FENCING FIELDS there's is a small house fenced in with a REBOOT VAN.. And MEOWSCLES IS THERE.. IN THAT HOUSE in the bedroom upstairs is a SAFE that has a 100% SPAWN RATE and yes there's gold in it... 131 gold to be exact.. So i don't know where Tommy got that info but it's ABSOLUTELY FALSE!!
Combat Caches were honeslty better than Supply Drops when they dropped Slurp Juices (and in team modes, where they dropped more loot depending on your team size). However, last season, nobody really opened them because they just weren't worth it. I'm glad Supply Drops are back in some way.
Thumbnails getting better and better
Please repent from your sins and turn to God, Jesus died on the cross so you have a chance at eternal life with God
The top of the video is glitching out and it's normal when I click off
by my part, i liked the graple blade more than the wings. sure, i hadn't played fortnite in DECADES, just played this last season because of my pals. but with it, i experienced a good chunk of it.  testing both items, the graple blade had more than the wings when it comes to fighting, you could easilly grab your rivals, knock them with the blade, and keep moving closer with the charges and similar, i won a bunch of battles like that.  the wings of icarus, while excelent for movement due to their fly hability, when it comes to attack is a total loss. the attempt to hit the ground with them is really hard and cluncky, and since you're stuck there until you drop makes you an easy target to be took down.  honestly i was hyped for the hades' chain since it would be a nice replacement, hope they re-add it soon.
5:06  is just wrong I have gotten bananas last night in fort
kinda crazy how almost everyone knows most of these "secretly" removed things where removed
I'm happy they removed roit shield and sad removed roit shield. Becaus rhe shield was op but there 2 should not existed. stund and pistol
I am actually happy that the  health thing in mythics are gone because it was way to  overpowered  thank you Fortnite ❤
no it
Snooty isn’t the only place there is also pleasant piazza
W vid
O:
Agree with me that the new season on fortnite is so epic✨🎆🎊
The safes are every where
T5g there is also a gold vault at those Beach houses with the purple sandcastles jsyn
the grapple blades were the best movement item in ranked, sad its gone
I love how everyone thinks that Midas is coming back but never does
7:05 Grapple Blade was better
If you have hades like this comment
Full video and a link 🔗 for your
NOT THE SCOPE THE NEW ONE IS TRASH
The safes did not go away bro
Where’s the background music your videos used to have
Bro crash pad jrs r such good rotation if u knew how to use them
Grapple over wings can't change my mind
i loved the grapple blade and the wings of Icarus are annoying cuz when i try to snipe someone after 1 shot they fly away...
At this point we’re gonna get Storm flip Jrs   Port a fort Jrs  and Air strike Jrs. 💀
I've noticed the yacht one
The grapple blade was way better
1:45 I was able to find a save in a lot of different poi
I have went to Snooty Steppes. I literally had the whole POI for myself 😭
SypherPK used it for infinite flying
The anvil launcher is by the the worst gun ever
I prefer the Grapple Blade over the wings.
Your are wrong about the safe only being at snooty steps. You can also get one where the old beach npc is in one of the houses
the wings suck, the fact that i can easily beam anyone using them out of the air is wild, and then it makes you drop making it even easier to kill you.
1 hour gang
Why had they removed the hades
anyone remember grenades😂
There is also a mini secret. If you look at the yacht carefully you can see that it’s trying to escape the corrupted water and it’s leaving the island
i miss good old spike traps :C
There still are some safes in the secret cave, its just not a 100% chance.
THE GRAPPLE BLADE IS 1000X BETTER THAN THE WINGS
I like the shield it was fun for challenges and I never died to it
Love your video Top5Gaming and keep up the great work you are awesome and congrats on 6 million subscribers
Dear top five gaming if you have and if you have in touch with fortnite please tell them to fix this x p thing and add more map changes😢
crash pad jrs are better than shockwaves and I will not be arguing on this
my sweet baby, hazy hillside got removed. landed there every game, WHY FORTNITE WHY.
The wings are a great replacement for the graplblade
I loved the grapple blade. Yes, the icaris mythic is better, but what happens when it's gone?  I really hope to get the grapple blade back
i loved the grapple blaid
Bro fortnite needs a huge update I wish they made fortnite how we want us to play
4:17 well that's useful now that no one goes to snooty 💀
The grapple blade is a lot better than the wings of Icarus because you’re not just gonna get beamed out of the sky with the blade
These happen too fast and epic is scarily good at it😂
0:39 they still exist in team rumble
You wouldn't be able to like this
You know what I'm happy is gone? Oscar's Frenzy Auto. The normal frenzy is problematic enough, but Oscar's all but guaranteed you were winning close-quarters fights with it's ability to 3-tap to the head. It made Peter's Hammer Pump not worth having (all the frenzies did that tbh) and there was virtually no counterplay.
Him saying the anvil rocket launcher is good is hilarious
Fun Fakt the cameras did that since Chapter 2 Season 2
The little vaults are not gone they are just harder to find
T5G you made a mistake.  (kinda) The bounty boards were replaced with quest boards -This is a board that was made in C4 C2 and gave you some quests. 2 we're "open a chest" and "eliminate a bounty"
I've seen miniature vaults elsewhere just can't remember where
The yacht is also randomly flipped backwards
i think the grapple blade could be used to counter icarus wings. imagine flying through the air and seeing someone fly towards you and knock you straight into the ground.
Bro caches r so much better, multiple guns max shield and 400 metal 💀
There is a safe in lavish lair
Am I the only ne who still finds safes ?
I think they should add a totally (either) useless or annoying "Jr." item with each update
I will be the one to tell u noobs weren’t the only people who loved the turret, as a og season 3 player I loved using it, it was great for cover or even a distraction to revive, it wasn’t even op or anything it was super easy to counter/break. If you hated it then I’m sorry to say it but YOU are the noob my friend
No I prepared the grapple blade
😮😊
I am always happy for the goofy "melee" weapons we got every season since C4, S1 (excluding OG of course). The only reason why melee is in quotes is because the Kenetic Boomerang is a ranged, melee-like weapon that gave no mobility live every single melee before and after it, but it fit in well with the season. I am counting the Wings a melee since it can deal damage within a close ranged area, being more of a evolved Rocket Ram with the attack, and sure most people will only think of it, like most other melees, as a mobility item. I miss the grapple blade, but understand that with each season, there is a new mobility melee to use and mess around with. I remember that I'm good enough with the grapple blade that I can basically solo my friends with just it when they are using guns (the only real weakness is shotguns and a prepared enemy)
They need to bring the scope back the thermal scope sucks
The wings suck if anyone uses it it’s a free kill the grapple blade was way better
Why is Peter gone nooooo😢😢
But wth is going on with these lobbies, you land in any of the new locations and your dead. At least that's what I and all of my friends experience.
If you like the wings hit the like button if you like the blade hit the subscribe button🧐😃
1:24 also the boat has turned around. I know this bc i was in game and couldnt find the launch pad at the front
Hyper smg sucked
Congrats on 6mill
I immediately saw the grapple blades gone and was sad
under an hour gang 👇
No the wings 🪽 are not very good because they  miss health😢
I found more gold things in different places not just there
i used a banana today in fn
I am watching a Fortnite ad and it is a T5G

There is a safe in a tiny house to
Can u pls do a new season storyline video. Love your videos .
What I miss tho are augments as they were ment to come back in chapter 5 but they are now completly removed. During chapter 5 season 1 there was an extra tap called augments (inwich there were 0 as they should have come back soon). And that was also teased in the milestones to use augments. I wonder what these augments could have been as this is what made chapter 4 stand out for me. Not just chapter 4 season 1 and 2 (maps, weapons, skins, maps and lore) but the different augments you could have used and combine them. Such things as the mythic pistol, getting bullets for sliding and so much more.
1 hour gang
Theres a safe a few hundred metres away from snooty
Secretly removed or just removed?
This reminds me of when I killed 2 sweaty ballistic sheild ppl when my friend was downed just by shooting their arms and legs
Pin this comment
No one talking about how they removed "The Squabble" Emote
Early👇
Dude the striker AR was really good o already miss it 😢
5:23 Anvil Launchers leaving are a blessing, you always got epic or legendary ones when opening mythic chests 😂
Hey i don't know if you've noticied but the boat marigold has changed directions, now it is leaving the island whereas in season 1 it was coming in.

Wings are ass grapple blade way better
Its better
I knew it was deleted the yacht npcs I seen it
The Safes are at every single area what do you mean
1:52 I saw a safe at mount olympus
CRASH PAD JUNIORS ARE USEFUL
PLEASE. CHANGE. YOUR. Terminology. Removing collabs like ninja turtles isn’t a secret 😂
The last week of the last season the sewer was gone from the game. TMNT were awesome wish they would have saved it or added some mutant villains from the series.
Yeah I noticed when I went into creative yesterday it would like start at level 1 and go through all my levels and like no creative maps worked on saturday
I wish the frenzy auto shotgun was vaulted
You hit 6m subscribers =]
Scrolling through subbed channels Best video found
bet they removed the 2x scope because siege did
Ooh
I like the grapple blade better because u can get shot out so easily with the wings
There is one port-a-potty its in that cave from previous season on the end and you can travel through it
I was just using the porta potty teleport today it’s not removed
The wings suck. U can easily get killed out of mid air
Bro safes are still in the game ☠️
the wings are so bad
not gonna lie the icurus wings SUCK
This channel is so amazing. The voice is so clear and always engaging. I used to like Fortnite, but after this channel, I like it more.
I feel like the grapple blade should have stayed in along side the wings because of the wings having a certain amount to use
The vending machine  makes me so mad cuz whenever last season me and my team were storm fighting at the boss locations we would got to the mending machine and heal but now if we storm fight we can’t  got to a mending machine to heal so we so die in storm if the circle isn’t far enough but if it is far then we’re dead
yes it is a good replsmint
bro called the anvil launcher a useful wepon what is he on?
i love grapple blades i hope they get unvaulted id rather have a grapple blae than the wings of iccarus
ive encounter safes this season not just at snooty
1:43 there’s a safe in the mansion where meowcles spawns
They didn’t remove safes
I like the grapple blade more the wings of icarus are so hard to aim when you dive
Let’s be honest Nobody, NOBODY wanted the Anvil rocket launcher in the game…
Love the Icarus wings. Im sure theh will be nerfed
I really don't like the wings but I loved the grappleblade
1 haur gang 👇
To be honest, it is so annoying that the grapple got replaced by the wings
42 mins
The Icarus wing are a good replacement for the grapple blades traversal but I mainly used it for combat
The man hole has not been removed
The wings suck so much
Yow cool film
6:57 JPG Le beau le parfum
I miss the health vending machines. They definitely came in clutch.
Crash pad JRs were overpowered why do people hate them, go into creative, and use one as you sprint jump on flat ground. It shoots you like 50 meters
What about “cabbage of the gods” instead?
The wings suck tbh the hit box is too big and every time you use it yiu just get sprayed
i want the grappl;e blade back'
so heres the way I see it, it would have been fine to have both in the game but as of right now in solos, not that great, in squads having 1 or 2 players as scouts for the rest of the team is so much fun
There is plenty of safes spread across the map
The grapple blade wasn't a gaurenteed death when you tried to run unlike the wings still like the wings but not better
in a broken vending machine for 100 gold I bought a random item and they gave me a banana
Bro my friends aren’t safe once the hades whip drops 💀
bro said icarus wings are better than grapple blade 💀 my guy- ur comparing something that makes ur hitbox like 3x as big, is slower, and has limited usage to something that was infinite usage, almost instant teleport-like grapple OF course the grapple blade is much better
Only thing I hate about the icrurus wings is that you could get beamed while flying and that epic could have made a nintendo collab by calling them kid icurus and giving us a nintendo based skin not exclusively for nintendo
We can always rely on Tommy for the latest Fortnite info. Thank u T5G, can't wait to learn more
anvil was part of metal gear solid colab
Is it just me or does anyone else know about those singing corals in the porterpotty
The grapple blade is literally infinite while the wings aren't
i presume jack got disabled for a day because of the skeleton when you get hit by lightning
kratos hates the gods that why he angy
Heheheha (I have committed unspeakable crimes)
They Nerfed the Icarus wings ALREADY! Now you can’t fly around Until the 300 is 0, now it’s split up into 100 uses and then they Burn up and force you too Land. That Sucks! 😒
RIP Akira Toriyama 🚨
wings are horrible my oppinion
i use to hide in bushes and when a car comes by i would use the anvil lol
What do yall think of this season so far?
I hope Top5Gaming posted the “Fortnite disappointment” Video soon because the Reaper Sniper Rifle and auto frenzy shotgun are still in the game all because of Tryhards Loving Auto Frenzy Shotgun and noobs loving the Reaper Sniper Rifle
grapple blade over the wings
Ain't no way he called the anvil rocket launcher "useful"
The wings are ass, you get shot once and you're dead
safes aren’t gone check the 3 house thingy on the shore south of the yacht
I love that grapple blade. I was the best at it. Get rid of the wings epic and bring back the grapple blade.
Bro I swear his videos feel so short
The Turrets are Gone! Thank god!
I'm the longest comment ever hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Wait who are the people who kidnapped   the banana guy
ngl the wings are kinda trash because it increases ur hitbox however there good for far rotates
Bro, I swear the bots literally have aim bot
I have to say the thermal scope sucks because it doesn't do much damage
Two things to notice, the splashes are back but can only stack up to 4. And 2nd, the wings are fun but you can get lasered hard
the graple blade was budget odm gear and the thundebolt is a budget kamehhaamha i am glade items simillar to these myhtics are in the game
now everything has to be made up and connected to chapter 2 season 2 its so anoying🙄
Fortnight "👍
Finally this guy mentioned Team Rumble
Under 1h Team 👇
Cool
Yo I just dropped and got one shot by a supply crate that spawned for no reason
Bro forgot that we all know the olf medallions are gone (Im talking about the thumbnail)
I think the hades mythic might come later in the season, but we’ll just have to wait and see.
The enforcer ar also got removed
Ho
Bing bong
The whole title is just click bait i mean ever player knew about them being removed. Now there way better like no duhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Well bye bye medallions everyone
I only use the business turret to get it the f*** out of my inventory also they should have replaced the grapple Blade with an actual freaking sword a sword and shield would go perfect with the greek season get it cuz the Greeks used swords and shields
Best channel thanks for the content
Tbh I’m glad that at least the instruments don’t take A WHOLE PAGE in the battle pass
Under an hour gang right here 👇
That shield bubble is only big enough to cover courages belly
There is actually a safe at a house where meoskules is. (Sorry if I butchered his name) 1:53
No there is a safe at the hous where meowsecols is to
The boat turned around to
-30min Team 👇
i do like the grapple blade and im sad its gone but the wings of icarus are a good replacement
You can still hide in dumpsters
Instead of me carrying shotguns I used to carry grapple blades, I am known among my friends as the person who can make anything annoying.
comp wise the grapple blade is so much better than the wings because you are an absolute easy target when using the wings and it leaves comp with basically no movement
bruhh i did not relizes that jaja
new season sucks button
Precisely 30 minute gang👇
brother the anvil sucked I would always get it out out of my god chests it was so dumb
wings are way worse than grapple blade in competitive since you wont be able too use wings in competitive since players have absurdly good aim in competitive scenarios.
HAPPY 6 MILLION SUBS I LOVE YOUR CONTENT BTW
That ballistic shield joke was funny
I got a safe at several locations in Season 2.
Curbres has a snake head on the end of his tail
Possible Donkey Kong Collab with the golden Banana?
To be honest, I didn't miss anything from that season, I love this season better because the items are fun to use. Anyways great job on the videos Tommy, I believe in you no matter what.
Moment of silence for bananas
Safes are 100% still in game I open atleast 1 every game
I have yet to see anyone complain about the striker ar, which btw, is infinitely better than the nemesis, which is one of the worst ar's ever introduced
Cool vid
Unpopular opinion: I prefer the grapple blade over the wings. I love the wings, but I just am a sucker for melee weapons and the grapple blade was just PERFECT!
It feels empty landing in the Boss places, since Valeria, Nisha, Oscar and Peter are not there no more......
Bro if you have the Icarus wing your an easy snipe
What I hope is that they bring back imposters
Snooty steps aren’t the only one with out a safe theres one at the beach house and it gives 131 gold but the npc disappeared and it has a weird looking sand castle
I just want my briefcase back
Hi
I bet this comment won’t get two likes
There is also a safe in the house where the meowscles npc is
The icarus wings are ass, it's super easy to knock you down, grapple blades are way better
30min     [    \/
No fun fact today. Have a nice day
The hit box is to big
The gold safes are still here 😂 i find them a lot
cause no one uses the train
The ballistic shield was not overpowered compared to everything in the season. List of weakness ballistic shield,auto frenzy shotgun (the  gun that needed vaulted but wasn't) smgs, assault rifle, grapple blade, pistol, someone good with a sniper
I swear if I see a “I will do one push-up for every like” comment I will go crazy
he hades chain is gonna return soon lol
Dude, the anvil rocket launcher was for the solid snake collab and gets vaulted along with everything else that returned with it
i think that the train tracks should have been crushed so there should have be a train crash poi
Dumpsters are here still
there is a safe in fencing :)
Hello
Not the turtles😢😢
THE WINGS SUCK, I WANT GRAPPLE BLADE BACK
HA THATS NOT THE ONLY SAFE THERES ANOTHER ONE AT Meowscles Location
20 minutes ago gang
Sheild bubble junior actually has a use though
I am so glad that ballistic shields are gone
Fortnite’s not dead 👇
I hate the wings. I get aimbotted every time just give us a grappler or sum
NO MORE SHEILDS!!!🎉
I found a safe in the poi that Zeus is in (I forgot the name where typing this)
Not true about creative I've been getting exp since Friday night
vehicles would be so much better than stupid instruments for stupid festival.  no one likes festival
I like the grapple blade better because it is harder to get sprayed
there are safes in mount olimpus
Yeah nah safes are still everywhere
I alredy miss the grapelblade😢
I thought the cameras did also mark you to everyone in chap 5 season 1, just like in chap 4
Thank you top five gaming❤😅
Bro what is your background music cause I can’t find that stuff bruh😅
Icuras wings bad replacement
i think the wings are not better than the grapple blade because it makes your hitbox so much bigger
As someone who plays as Monks, I am upset about the banana update  Edit: As someone who plays as Monks, I am excited for the Banana of the Gods
Who else thinks he is the goat of top5 👇🏻
They removed the grappler blade? Aw man, I loved going melee

People who think all the junior items are mid at best.. 👇
Anyone who is sad about the safe, there is one at the 3 beach houses next to the yacht.
Man I was hoping you’d say fireflies
15 mins early damn
supply dops on top (i cant do emojis)
the grapple was a good rotate but the wings are a  good replacement
Glad the anvil is gone. It was annoying to find it in every mythic chest
You forgot that the free Jackie Skin in Rocket Racing was also removed although it was supoosed to stay for two extra weeks.
no way bro said the anvil is useful
I miss the grapple blade so much 😢
Earliest I’ve ever been
The shield bubble Jr is made by coral buddies prove me wrong
Grapple blade is better for fights and wings are better for exploring but easily get you killed
4:20 I'm mad at epic for removing the riot shield
People who want the grapple blade instead of the wings 👇
I love you  I love you  I love kids 💀
Congrats on 6 mil
The one about the safes is wrong, a safe also spawns in the house east of fencing fields
Nice vid!❤
Oh and I was goofing off in creative and you can grapple blade onto the wings and just with them
The new wings are so easy to hit 😂
Only bots hated crash pad jr best movement
