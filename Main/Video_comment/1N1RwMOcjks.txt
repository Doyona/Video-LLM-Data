0:21 THE EXPOSING TRUTH EXPOSES: Confused hue mans are without awareness that calling a sexual partner daddy and her to be called a baby is pedofilic.  They literally malprograms this concept into the brain and then manifests r the concept into the populust until they all seize this relationship reference. This is knot cute or attractive within this molestation environment called Earth. This is knot the first hue man to make this reference, we would witness many after. Consciousness starts with a question and acknowledgement of the answer. I am led to witness and state.
Dope🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🚀🚀🚀🚀

Nicki really is The Queen right now. She spits bars better than most, and she STILL doesn’t have a Grammy? How does that shit make any logical sense? I feel she’s been blackballed somehow. Either way, screw the Scammys, we’ll recognize our Queen ourselves.
Nicki’s ability to flow with any beat is so cool to listen to. She is the GOAT.
I always wondered since watching I think it was Stray kids at this award show, seeing Megan The Stallion doing a song on stage and twerking and their costumes being really revealing; and I just thought to myself initially how adorable it was that they’re so shocked by us.  But then it got me thinking now, how many of these people in other countries that are more strict in morals and appearances secretly watch our US rappers or artists and actually really enjoy the show.  😅 like I get you are not used to seeing this, but I just think or wonder if they actually had already simply been curious about what American artists are like and go and watch. Like do people in Korea, Japan and China see artists like Nikki Minaj, Cardi B, Coi here and hear the songs but also see the outfits or limited clothing and just get so attached or attracted to it even though they know it’s wrong by their society or their culture.
Leray killing wtf, wet as the navy is insane

This song is horrible
I heard latto was supposed to be on this song to be honest cori did better I like latto but this wouldn't fit her voice
Grab his mic and sing it? Nicki always make it easy to expose the skin tone.
That girl got the body of a 10 year old boy...i like this song because of nikki though.

Nicki rode the hell outta this beat. One of her best.
Fr love that shit ❤
So this is benzinos daughter now i can see it she can't rap just like her father can't fancy doing a feature with the best who can actually rap id be shamed
Nicki carried and I can admit that and I don’t listen to either of these hoes. The girl fr fell off. You know it’s bad if I can’t even remember her name 😭
Nicki remind me of my best friend Valerie ! How she can always change her style to match my energy! ❤
This was the most vile thing I have ever listened to it's not even appropriate calling this music this was an amalgamation of random cuss words stuck together to make something sound disgusting
Wow I can't stop the first singers verse and her swag woooo

Is she a rapper or singer?
Broo coi leray  is like honestly my favorite  girl rapper besides cardi b  and nicki Minaj coi leray you are my inspiration  I actually love rapping myself I just don't like cameras because in public school people made fun of me for rapping they told me you white trash you will never ever be able to rap like these rappers and I was just like screw you but you inspire  me to rap just not on camera because of what happened back when I went to public school now my mom teaches me which is cool and stuff but I would rather be rapping instead of doing school if I am going to be honest also Nicki  Minaj you inspire me too! Keep being yourselves and keep being honest and funny and awesome!
The fuk is this, its horrendous rap has been made a complete joke now
ANYONE FROM 2025

Whos here after Coi addressed the “beef” on Theshaderoom
Shake your  but t girl you  are my best  twerk  girlfriend girlfriend ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
She doesn't know an op or a Blick Blick. Rich her whole life.  So fake.  Her dad is a loser too.
She is super talented but I would be horrified being that exposed when I have brothers and sisters my parents
HAAAAAAAAARD!!🔥
WHO IS HERE NOW????
I think Coi is so talented , however the vulgarity is so normalized these days. I just can't with the wet who-ha lyrics etc. Just why does music have to be this way. What are we teaching young girls who listen to this, and they do hear it, even if there is a clean version.
I Love BARUE!
2/10
❤❤❤❤
Nicki really gave another fire verse to yet another ungrateful artist
I appreciate she's rocking her natural chest.
Her best verse from 2022
@ Here For Nicki❤
I love this it’s so fucking good!
Cool
Nicki da queen of rap because of how much control she has on her flow and rap style, and by using that she can adapt her style to match others when doin features

Who’s all here just to see all Nickis  collaborations? 🤟🏽
How did nobody see Lil Wayne
These two supposedly “colored” artist looking more Asian then black.
Nicki has finally met a rapper worse than her.
1:08 My favorite part of this video.  The timing of the dance move right here is sick af
coi must wear a size -10
MASTERPIECE ❤
She’s on to something here 🥶
¯\_(˶′◡‵˶)_/¯

Whats the beef between the two??? Can a fellow barb fill me in?
Trash
Just came here to drool over how Nicki looks so damn good in this video 😢❤❤❤😂😂😂
2024 and we still here for the Queen verse 💯💯🎀🎀
nickis wig here >
Nicki is so classy 💛✨
Damn this track hit hard😂
I would be very offended if I were Coi, this is her song and Nicki is jst featuring in it bt most of the comments were bout Nicki not Coi and the few that did mention Coi wasn’t bout her rapping skills bt bout her body
Ngl skipped to Nicki’s verse which that part was the good part! 🔥
Coi ate eat the cookie like a nutter butter butter
No cap I love blick blick
Nicki ate ❤
UH!!!!!  PUSH IT  PUSH IT CLICK  CLICK!  Those Dobermans are so cute and Coi dancing right in front of them @ 3:35     UH OH, "HERE COME NICKI"
Her body is insane. She absolutely looks feminine and sexy. Why would anyone look at her and laugh? Like I really do not see what the hell anybody talking about. I just showed this video to a few of my male friends, and thet all agreed wth mel thought she was "fine as hell". I just heard this song recently too, and honestly I don't know why people hate on this girl or her rap in music at all. I just don't get it. I'm actually really confused. Are we seeing the same thing?  I feel like there's something I don't know🤔
I wish I was Nicki Minaj 😂..her life seems great😅..but it's too good to be true 😂
Skinny girls are the best for me👌
This did not age well too😂
Nicki minaj 💅💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💋💋
Coi a better rapper then her father
That Cardi shade is crazy 😂 “all dem P.R. Stunts, but u ain’t puertorriqueña”
"HOES AIN F#CKN WIT BARBIE"
I love you Nicki
That look is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Imagine not watching this for Coi Lerary's sexy ass.

Why does everyone always have the need to point their insecurities on other bodies? Even if you’re trying to make a nice comment or talk about how “she makes you feel better”, you have to understand you’re not getting anywhere pointing out unrelevant stuff in a MUSIC video. There’s literally no need. Because then you make their bodies look like an insecurity when nobody cares.

ALCALÁLÃLÀLÂLÄLÅLĀ stop talking, you're to powerful the piccolo is a very important instrument because the responsibility is all yours. My music teacher Mr. Candelaria
It blows me away. I mean sincerely, it really puzzles me. What puzzles me ? I’ll tell you what does. How anyone or anything would like this type of GARBAGE ! That’s what  puzzles me.Surely to God,the artist  could use better language.  And you wonder why the world has changed to the worse. Where in the hell did Rock  n Roll go ? Huh ?    But,to each his own. Correct ? If I don’t like it, I don’t have to listen to it. I DON’T & I WON’T ! The End !

This song is definitely hard! Dope Bars with a Sick Beat! But I did wonder half way through, how come it’s only us that are glamorising killing each other in the music industry, while BIG corporations (who ain’t about that life) throw millions at it? 🤔   Then I rewound the song so I could listen to it again.  🤦🏽‍♀️
Thanks to Nicki....please bring back the old Coi .....WE need Coi!!!!
SO...................................THEY RAP ABOUT WET PU----Y ,,DISCUSTING  THEY ARE  REALLY MAKEING WOMEN  LESS DESIREABLE EVERY SINGLE DAY AND ,,,,,,,,,,WOMEN OF ALL AGES LOVE IT ,,THIS SHIT DONT WORK OVER HERE IN MY OWN CLASSY LANE! ALWAYS

STIL ONE OF MY FAV SONG
Niggas will really spin the block if the queen send a Tex thru.period
Ok u got my attention
If there was ever a better example of nepotism or "it's about who you know" (or in her case, 'who you're related too') you'd have to point it out, because this 'Coi Leray' takes the cake.    100m view video and I've never heard of her while other artists have 1-2m views even without a Nicki collab that the whole world knows.
Coi u fucked everything ❤❤❤
Rapviet qua đây....
Wanna bad bitch keep on wish baby

Omg nicki her verseeee is everything for ever en always queen of rap

The fact that we thought Nicki and Coi will have a good long run friendship made me sad 🥹
Pink Friday 2 album can’t wait ❤
Everybody talking bout nicki and her verse I good but coi from 0:47 to 1:01 is fire tbh❤
Im so jealous of Coy, ive wanted to look like that all my life and no matter how hard i work at it i cant get there now that im sober. Im glad im clean and everything,  but i miss the way my body looked.

The amount of times I have heard Nicki’s verse is insane. There is no one as versatile as her, period 😳
Nicky completely ate the pen 🖊 again 🎉❤ coi amazing 👏 😍 🙌  they compliment one another so well ❤❤❤❤❤
Deu um hit a coi
top medical service in the end!👐
She warned her not to go against her in the damn song 😂
Lmao two bozo’s poisoning the minds of young people ,

2:34 kane grocerys!!!!
what has happened to music
Hopefully she gets money for this vid to do breast implants
This callab is 🔥🔥🔥 coi leray lil ass is so fucking sexy and Nicki been bad
People…. Nicki don’t write features. There’s always better bars in her features than her own shit. Eight people write this song/bars. Go look at credits for all her songs… not one damn song has her as the only lyricist/writer.

Coi Leray is one of the realest/finest  rappers on the scene right now!
nicki is really talented.
I love you so much 🎉🎉🎉❤
eh just another ghetto girl with foul language MUSIC DIED
You the SHIT and you need some tissue? Uhm eew.. And you'll do whatever for a dollar???  Are those supposed to be good or attractive things?.. How the hell did I come across this ahahaha I'm laughing so hard thank you
I really gotta give it to her. While others take ass shots and get their boobs abnormally enhanced, Coi stays real and does not damage her body for fame and still wins. The realest out there, she is THE role model. Props, my love.
Coi be's the new it girl! She a playa too
😢
“Euhhhhhh, Push it Push it” 😂😂😂😂
Só eu fico meio constrangida por ela parecer uma criança 😅😂
dude why is kane groceries in here😂😂😂 2:35
☃️
After all this tik tok shit I can't unsee Putin in Nicki 🤣
2:35 why tf do random goth money members keep popping up in music videos 😭

Nicki verse only
i need to be really drunk to fight for her.....
the way nicki made this a flop, Doja would have done a banger, get granny out
I use play uhmm Imagination with a naked doll.  I wish a  🍫🍯chunky barbie

"you know you bad when you can post from any angle" this is how I know i'm not bad 😂😂
I’ve listen to this song every day sync it came out
🤮🤮🤮
All these PR stunts but biiish u aint Puerto Ricana. Wait coi is black and puerto rican cape but your not Puerto Rican cause your not 100%. Nikki be calling out people right to they face. dang. she do have a point. to be a puerto rican you need 3 dna' African Congolese, Spaniard canary and Taino. Stewing that dna in a caribbean pot since 1492 that 531 years aged of the tri dna on the island. Sorry no cape. No criolla. Nikki on fleek
SHE DID THE ICE SPICE EMOTE
Very ummm.. what’s the word im looking for? Ladylike! That’s what I was thinking! Talking about fucking men and getting our “pussies wet” oh dam I’ll tell ya, YouTube really picks and chooses what they consider acceptable these days
Blick blick 🤟🏻
Chendesh
I my snnshwikqiwjqoqoqqoqww
Coi e Nicki não se seguem mais, será que brigaram? 😢
Niki is always the best
Crazy thought: I think Nicki IS a Ghost writer. I think Nicki writes songs and gets others to buy it (anonymously) then if someone comes at her sideways then she puts em in a chokehold 😂. I still think it was such a setup when Nicki asked Coi how she wrote the song. 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
🤩🤩🤩🇨🇴
She said the n word she is  not black
She a Nicki and Carti wannabe. They all sound the same
Y'all sexy
❤
Just cut out cois part lol 😂
So estou aqui pela nicki
Such an unnatural way to hold a long gun…..Makes sense
I remember a time they would never let you talk about sex and do these moves in this video lol… miss that time… something’s are better left for the imagination…😂
♡♡♡♡
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
My two favorite artists
Love me some coi leray🙌🏾🫶🏾 Nicki the Queen🫶🏾🤎
I hate it when the female rappers think they need Nicki as a pr boost 18k first week? Find a talent asides from being a photoshopped yellow
What how 1 year passed?
now it's Coi giving CLOUT and exposure to granny Nicki.
Sounds alot like Panda.
Why does she look 13? This is what I imagine seeing in hell right when I walk in the door
RIP X
I love them both!! ❤❤❤ my favourite song 🎉
Then they complaint about the murders and unemployment
God bless my wife Coi Leray forever
🔥
Why this Master Piece isn't 100 M yet?💃🏿
damn Coi is so sweet, her smile naughty sweet! 🤩🥰..and how come not to love Nicki !!
Leray proof skinny bitches get it too👏👏 ~~~
god yessssss <3
thank u for saving this song nicki
Sexy
Coi Leray can really move !
I never knew Coi is Benzino's daughter till  today. She's an actual rap legacy.
😮 Wonderful beautys 👏👏😧🎶💃💋😘😘😘😘
Well I tried. I really did. I totally cannot relate to this video. This is obviously a narco-rap video like the cartel gangs in Mexico do. Why are these two ladies trying to be narco-rap gangstas? Is this what the black community thrives on? Narco-rap?
YES COI😮😅
Nicki is the best
Uniquely savage
Happy 1 year to Blick Blick
Im mad nicki didnt turn around 😒

Why not fully naked its 2023 what are we waiting for?
I like when skinny confused bald women think their gangster and gesture fake gun movements and pretending to be something their not.
Why is she covering her chest? 🤔😅
chunky barbie
Well no wonder you thought you needed to wear masks if this is a s*** y'all listen to
FALALALALALA

Nicky just slaying 😍
0:04
AYO GIRL GOT DA RAAL MG FROM CALL OF DUTY
Neither of them ever used or tried to use a blick, espwcially with those long ass nails. U know this song is all cap. Nothing more retarded or annoying than hearibg a girl too concerned with how they look and what wig to wear, talk bout being hard or acting like they would ever attempt anything that they talk bout in this video. Shit is sorry.
Also, I bet  Coi wishes she really did write that hook 😂😂😂
I like Coi and love her confidence... But ye can really tell the difference between a rookie and a legend, on the same song, same beat obvs, and the difference in their verses is apparent. Not to diss Coi, respect for collaborating with the best female to ever do it, and she was nice on the song. And to be honest, Nicki has a habit of bodying her collaborators, particularly on THEIR OWN SONGS LOL😂😂😂 but fair play to them both for a whopper tune, I love it😁❤🇮🇪
Given I listen to deathcore and like this is embarassing
Okay there goes the fake body it's never going to be interesting by Nicki
Nikki she got you beat she all natural
I don't care what y'all coy smashing he on this
Ol slim got to going on The exorcist played out I want all real
This is my shit!!!  Perfect collab for Nicki to be on 💖 I love to see Coi’s growth.
No cori us the shit period
Skinny version of Nicki minaj is fire
The size difference 🤣🤣
Utter shite 😂
Yo this is wild. Women act like men now. Unattractive.
this gives me zero excuse to not know how to shake my butt
Beautiful
Very cute
Coi Killin it
Coin Killin it
Nicki just has that start quality like she ain’t got to do shit but be there lol 🔥
💜💜💜💜💜
Doesn't that coi chick remind you of men in black 1 when Kay offers jay coffee and they head to the coffee room lmao. Nicki is amazing however, polar opposites

I'd still like coi music, but messing with Queen Nicki got her blacklisted now.
I literally cannot wait for the zombie apocalypse.
I hope she doesn't get a fake bum and boobs to fit in to the industry. She's so good she almost outshined Nickii in this video.
Up
NICKI >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
amo o verso da nicki
Nicki Minaj's verse is insane. Her wordplay is unmatched.
this is a nightclub classic NOT relavent ; how. like I'm there
haha and I searched for click click, dammmmmm I am a white dutchman but this really tingles me.
Her verse better than lattos... I'm a latto fan, Nicki fan and Coi so this is my real opinion
yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
Hate it
💚💚
Blick blick
Was that lil wayne? Lol
People with body positivity over skiny girls is as bad as with fat girl... she legit anorexic and is having deep mental issues...
This is my fav video of coi help
In the UK it's the opposite thick girls are called fat.. and skinny girls are considered more hot...
Nikki rocks
just desert
That’s a 10
Coi leray is one of my favorite modern time rappers
Nasty 🤢 wtf y'all want y'all's kids listening to this
Ill smash their beans
Coi is so hot that I don't even care about the music lol
Yo, we finally got to the point that the weirder your ass is makes you hot lol
I bet Coi vajaja smell like corn chips.
These new artist were listening to Niki so it’s fucking awesome that they get to work with her❤❤❤
🎀🎀🎀
Damn Coi smh mm mm mm
I will NEVER understand these wannabe divathots talking wannabe tough shyt “when ops on the block we spin it like tornadoes” smh yeah ok she’s confusing 🍆 for a 🔫.  Then let’s go in on this 90lb celebrity child doing her little trigger finger “I’m a shooter” bs 😂. There are some gangster females out there but these 2 aren’t with ANY of it they are just perpetuating the trash “culture”.
Why does Coi look so much thinner here than anywhere else? They better not be telling her to lose weight!!?
Why does Coi look so much thinner here than anywhere else? They better not be telling her to lose weight!!?
They bring all these transgenders  in after therapy
I can’t believe they make music like this. The wickedest thing is this does not represent their own ideas and beliefs. I bet they are very submissive in their personal lives and are looking for long term build a family type of relationships and I guarantee they won’t let their children listen to their own garbage but it’s ok for ours. This does not represent them but this represents what their ashkenazi overlords wants to feed our youth with and take our money.
Live❤v
Long story short he esp trolled me out of everybody house for ag augment I’m feel fuck everything but hope it’s confusion I need need help asap sleeping on the train now but I’ll get on my feet times like this u see who really got ur bck

I respect Nicky so much Not rhyming Draco on say so. One of my favourotitty artists plus my new favourite Artist. Love IT.
Yep,sadly this is what the world has stopped too,god help us all!!!!!!!
NM sucks
Oh look porn with a video.  She lost my respect if you can’t write a song without sexualizing everything.
Si no es por el verso de nicki Minaj esta canción es bastante mala
Still here listening, I love me some Coi
Yes
Nicki stealing Tiffany Fox flow tiff was flowing like that in 2016! Or earlier, she's such a rip off!
I only listen to this for Nicki
So lit
i love coi part but nicki carried this song . 😩
..I'm still waiting for the Latto re-remix 💅🏻💅🏻
Boaring
Music is dead 😢
this the new monster verse
Female rap is over when Nicki retires 😢
Why aren't they enough people saying how Coi Leray killed too
Inês Brasil Coi é sua irmã 😂
Elas são muito bonitas cada uma do seu jeito.
Je t'aime nicki
Coil did that😍😍😍
Why is she acting so trashy and breaking my heart? coi is so perfect, I dont want no trashy twerk girl.
I’ve never heard of her, but she’s looks like a starved version of Cardi B
Goodlife zindagi
I hope LeRay doesn't change her body.  I love the look!
NICKI: 🤜🏽↘️↙️🤛🏽🙅🏽‍♀️ WRIST ON CHUCKY ON BARBIE!🔥
I miss Nicki man
kanker
She is a very good talented rapper! One of the few!
Coi did her thing in this video, she danced next to Niki but she still killed it.#lovecoi
No longer a barb. Them and Nicki at times are repulsive people. 😂. But she’s someone I can separate the art from the artist for. This was her best work of 2022 easily
I’m proud them both  (not that it matters)
girl you did that
Go nicky
On point
Coi e nicki fazem uma bela dupla😍 amo essa música amo essas duas mulheres
Trassh
This song has zero lyrical meaning whatsoever. It’s just words strung together randomly.

Nicki minaj Is beautiful inside and out  And looking great She is a flawless 40  And I hope to look as great as her when im her age flawless 40
Why is she tweaking she so disgusting
Nicki’s videos are always so cheap 😂
コイの「Yeah」の言い方毎回好きなんだよなあ
It’s either - nicki is so great OR I love how Coi loves herself …

Lil Kim - Black Friday (Nicki Minaj Diss) (Official Music Video)
Only here for Nicki’s versitility
I see why the new girls disrespect Nicki cause when they get her age nobody will care cause she still delivering
I just heard the latto reference track for this song and all I can think of is how Latto should have been on this one I'm just saying
Who here after the latto leak😭
Onika Mary Magdalene now can everybody quit wasting their breath praying to a father of the catholic
how self depracating and embarassing.
How the hell did this chick become a rapper? Extremely basic lyrics that are weak, at best.  I guess anyone can become a rapper these days.
This is not even her flow 😂 she sound just like latto
Coi is better than Chocolatto
Normalize giving Coi her kudos for loving her natural body and not allowing men to make her feel bad while NOT tearing down curvier women. You don't have to bring one group down to raise up another. 🙃
Fraud
I just skip to nicki’s part tbh
Heard her before I saw her. Then I saw her and found out she’s natural instantly im a fan
Love her!!!!!
Who still watching the video after ts with latto
Pez coi
Todays music is gross 🤮

I love Coi  energy in this music video,like is everything 🔥🔥
This song also deserved a Grammy Nomination🔥🔥
Who don't luv Nikki but Coi .... SEXY made me think twice bout slim females

I LOVE THIS SONG

There seems to be a movement going on in the music industry to dumb women down.  Progress has been made over the years for women to gain more respect, but female entertainers like this serve as role models these days to teach young women to behave like sex objects even though women have fought not to be treated this way over the years. They have trampled on progress and taken their followers backward not forward.  These entertainers heavily promote sexual permiscuity, sexual perversion, and pornography. These are vices that ruin lives.  These women give the false impression that sexual perversion is glamorous and liberating, when in truth, it is dirty, disgusting, and degrading.  Those who live this lifestyle end up with feelings of low self-esteem, depression, and self-loathing. Some may end up used and abused by men. People who follow these examples to live in depravity will find themselves on a dark and slippery path.  They will become imprisoned rather than set free.  There are consequences for living this lifestyle and promoting it.  We live in a very fallen world when people are applauding satanic practices such as these. An old trick of the devil is to make look glamorous what actually destroys and he uses women like this to accomplish his purposes to ruin people.  In the end, those who fall for these tricks will be totally and completely devastated to find themselves locked away in the darkness of Hell to await Judgment Day when they will be rejected by God forever.
Ft, Nicki you will never go wrong rather you will go long

Coi look like MJ at times, funny
Only gave this a listen because of Nicki Minaj now this girl mad cuz she wasn’t on a remix when Nicki defended her

Nicky always hitting diferent❤️❤️❤️🥺
“i call him big daddy, he call me lil baby” am i the only one finding that funny😅
She dont need to wear a bra 🤭😂

Sigh this video did not age well; COI FEESH is now a TRAITOR and OPP to Nicki Minaj
coi leray is a jealous b n nicki verse saved that track
💛🔥🔥🔥
I love this song sorry Nicki 🥺❤
Nicki really called this girl Olive Oil 😭💀
Nicki only worked with Coi because her label wants her to
Who needs superheroes and romantic novels to fantasize? I have you and that is more than enough for me! I love you darling.
She  looks crazy  overthere
🥵🥵🥵
Coi is so animated I love her in this video. @1:35 I was 🤪🤩
Ughhh this new generation of artist and music is trash
🦴
She already has a whole song with Nicki why is she mad
all the Barbz gather here and unsuscribe to her channel 🙄😒
👏👏👏👏👏
❤
Coi Leray bitter for not being on the Queen's remix. Sad...
Any female rappers to kill this Coi Leray hard type beat https://youtu.be/hOtdsFrrypw
more like Queen 👑 Nicki Minaj featuring Coi Fish 🐠! the Queen ate this little bitch up!
You would think she would stay loyal to nicki because she was the only artist that was willing to work with her smh 🤦‍♂️
Coi Leray is so @$$, the streets will never forget when that crowd was dead silent 🤣🤣🤣🤣
How anybody think coi hott is beyond me. Not with those mosquito bites and flat back side.
Yessssss
Ent you in Trinidad?
I think I may be the only person who didn't like Coi Leray's verse. I think Nicki stole this to be honest and I'm not a Nicki Stan.
👑👌🏾
Nicki's verse is so insane.... i love her flows and bars, she literally went hard on this verse.
Looks like quite a few people like this one, eh?   I admit, overall it's pretty good actually.  The girls look sexy!   Yeaugh!!!!!
Cool fish aka olive oil blacklisted bitc
Love you Nicki but someone should've told you how to hold that gun right 🙈🙈 dam 😅
Well… this didn’t age well 💀.
Why are you here? Why are you alive?.. https://youtu.be/EdCO0BmG6hA
Unfollowed and unsubscribed bitch bye ✌🏼
Putak was right this is so hot
Coi is so disrespectful to Nicki 😡 but Nicki is still in the video so I will keep watching it
We don't need Nicki anyway. It's giving coke.
Here after they have unfollowed each other

Without nicki on this song,it would have been trash😂😂
Who els skips up to Nicki minajs vers😂😂😂😂
wow she took nixki name off the video damnnnn 😂😂😂
I still can’t believe Coi did this. When you have a mthfck MV with the QUEEN & this feat is the one of your MOST popular tracks, but then you just decided to ruin all these quite friendly relationships between Queen & her fanbase… Clown shit 🤡
coi done lost my love for her.. only real fans know!
is this nikis sister or what
Ok
Olive Oil looking real dumb right now
Why are the dudes with the rifles walking like Elmer Fudd 😂
“ had sèx with him ain’t give my number” I’m pretty sure that’s really good for the guy, lol

I didn't like it it's not a club song ain't nobody playing that in the club not that song that's just my opinion I'm going to press the dislike button

Aaah Queen Nicki 😌🔥🔥🔥🔥
they like so cute😍😍😍
But if you don't like her why have her on your page? #Wegoup
É Coi Leray, pisou na bola ⚽️ ingrataaa
How you figure you can talk about the 👑 and it won't get back to her #youfuckedup
I can't ever see coi the same, loved this song but mostly because of nicki. #humbleyourselflilgirl
Coi game is over
I didnt know this is the song Nicki work with this girl. I just search it after the Twitter drama this girl made. I mean i played this song so much but never really paid much attention to who Queen work with coz her verse and style aint really that hit. This baby girl is soo mad she wants to make drama to be popular again. Too bad for you girl.
Only care about Nicki on this
Coi’s album flopped big time 😹😹😹😹😹😹 you deserve it you 🐍
Only here for the queens verse ✌🏽
hm i love nicki but coi leray lyrics here are very unimaginative for me. i want to like that, nice beat, but her part doesn't convince me. :/
I only like Nikki part s 💯🤣
😐
So sad, she is so talented💔💔💔
Coi flopedd
super freaky girl🍒

I’m so disappointed with COI

#Trina x #Latto #Clap 👏🏿🎵 #DaBaddest  https://youtu.be/jiJGkQxZDgY
It’s sad we won’t get another Coi x Nicki but it is what it is, I’m glad we have Blick Blick
Your line should have been "Uh push it push it I'm a psycho, I just wanna have a moment to control Minaj". Btch, even if Nicki forgives you, Barbz will never forgive u. You should know how we get down, yea go support CB we don't give a fk.
Who came here after nicki unfollowed coi ???😂😂
really disrespected the only female rapper that defended you. goodbye
fake
goodbye coi. it was fun fake a**
I'm back here after Nickisteaparty. Who else?

Niki did her thing. The other girl sounded terrible. At first I thought this was a joke.
Every nigga tryna pop ain't the next Woo  Don't run up in my DM, R-I-P to X, too  Check who? Niggas'll really spin your block if the queen send a text through😳😮‍💨   Nicki really be spittin some hard sh!t but it’s always overlooked cause she a female.. one day they will see why she really is/was the QUEEN OF RAP 👑

when you work in the same place with the queen, she doesn't have to do anything to pull the blanket over herself, I think you need to thank coi, she's a great fellow, she squeezed all the juice out of herself, and showed that she can do a lot, that she has nicki  on feat and not vice versa ,she made a show

Wtf did I just listen to this chicks songs suck she sounds the same in everything is it cuz hey daddy got money why she Soo famous now only song that people liked I Kno is the friend one w.e the name is n even that one sound the same.
I love Nicki Minaj but I feel like people are just only spitting good things on nicki Minaj in this when it’s not even her song and everyone’s only talking about how much hate coi Leray gets like maybe don’t only comment good things about somebody that has like a 30 sec part in the song. Thanks to anybody who see’s this <3

This shit u pulled with Megan after you got your collab with Nicki shows why she should stop fu*kin with you weirdos... Album ain't sold sh*t cause your intentions weren't pure from the jump... Big barb energy‼️🔥 #CORNBALL
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💕❤️🥰
eu amo esse feat , adoro ver as rappers se apoiando
Nicki's whole energy is off. She normally has a very dominant, bad bitc# fully confident oozing sex appeal energy. The type that was unfuckwithable energy!! Here she seems beating down. Self conscious. Idk I hope that's not the case because babyyyyy she's still got it ❤️
eu amo issoo
The songs of today lol ngl nicki saved it
Here to support the Queen.
This is child’s play for Nicki
I actually like this song I hope she keep her natural body
Never a carb not eaten.
Coi sound like riley freeman

Auntie im going out my beard 2 month

If I’m not mistaken I think when Nicki mentions “I got a whole army ask Charlie” she’s talking about Charlie and the Chocolate Factory considering Willy Wonka has an army of Oompa Loompa’s who help him maintain and keep his empire of candy running. Nicki has an empire of powerful fans being the Barbz who support her heavily in every aspect and keep theirselves updated on everything she does which is different than relying on general public support. Therefore Charlie’s Angel’s wouldn’t make sense when he depends on just 3 women which wouldn’t be considered an army.
coi leray is just.... so cool... omg what a queen <3

U a wannabe boy lady !!!! U sound goofy asf on here coi 😬😬🙄🙄😳😳🤣🤣🤣🤣
amo minhas fav do rap
this lady gives us the version we have been ashamed to embrace cause of media polarization. Im talking the slim lady with small boobs and no fat bum. I like this...i love how she shows she isnt insecure about her body
female rappers everyone
You no you bad when you can post from every angle
I love the way she dances. I’m too much of a thug to be romantic. Say my name likes it’s your mantra. I could show you tantras. These lil niggas baby’s so eye just let me throw their tantrums 🙏🏾
Has anyone heard the original version of this song made by EkaMan? Lmfao 😂
Cashoutmike is a better tiktok rapper then this shii😭
this is so bad 😭😭😭😭
Holy shit.. weezy really pimpin out nikkis amazing talent for anyone & that's sad.. Notice how Nikki didn't wanna be seen shooting even a fake gun?  Cuz she's said even in her rhymes she won't shoot some one, cuz she's not stupid, dumb, and reckless like this dumb bishh..  I had no idea they gave 12 year old boys who act hard record contracts.. I have nothing but hope for tekashi69s snitch asss now
I fucks witchu Coi 💜💋
Nicki is a genius. Gorgeous and her flow unmatched. Serving major queen vibes queen 👑
Can’t stop listening
I really like this song I listen to it everyday it's like sometimes I just be walking I be like push your push it but anyway you have skills honey I see it in you you have to aim reach for the Stars Mama because at the end of it is a lot of competition out here you have to come harder in this industry you got to come hard mama but I'm proud of you you're doing a good job I love your style I promote your music where I promote this song a lot on my Facebook cuz I love this song but God bless you Mama I wish you well on your rap journey always remember wrapping is really a hobby and that's your money into other things that you want out of life because like me I like to rap once I do a certain amount of little albums that's it I'm moving on to do something well I don't know I'm not going to say that because I love to ride I've been rapping since I was like what that ain't 12 I don't know yeah about 12:13 maybe and I am 38 now but I still look 13 well God bless you all out there
Could this be less impressive than I actually think it is? What the fuck has happened music? God damn, people listen to some straight bullshit these days...
On repeat
Nicki needs to do a song with rubi rose..they look exactly alike she just the skinny version of Nicki
Has Nicki perhaps picked an heiress???
That’s better get a better singer in the
Voice so look like

Королева и принцесса
Only thing is…. Almost EVERY line Coi LERAY spits during this WHOLE song (dare I say it) are *recycled* AKA *STOLEN* ~very well known lyrics~ <From a bunch of OTHER well known past artists> EXCEPT: for the ONE ☝️ and ONLY line where she says sum “Fuck that nigga, never gave that boy my number” and perhaps when she also said sum “eat this pussy like it’s a nutter butter”! Other then that she’s constantly repeating several different one liners/verses she’s heard elsewhere, linked them all together… put it’s all on top of a fire beat and then *VOiLA* ~~~BLICK BLICK was made!! Even tho it’s sorta bogus and unethical for her to do… the outcome still nevertheless made a fire result! So I’m not mad at it! Though, shouldn’t I be????!!??!!
🥳FINALLY A COI LERAY SONG 🎵 🎶 THAT I CAN TRULY GET BEHIND AND LISTEN TOO! They brought sum heat🔥 on this one 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Got my ticket for rolling loud....I can't wait to see NICKIIIIII for the very 1st time....I'm EXCITED

Yo… seriously something making me angry… like ma girl Coi Leray over there doing a queen’s job and always gives us incredible songs, so like I heard some people hating on her that’s weird ‘cause obviously all they say is not constructive and they just making fun either her style, her body, etc… and I want to ask a question… What in the f does that has to do in the way she rap or her talent.. DAFFAq… seriously not cool… I just discover her and I’m sticking with her songs ! 🥰 (I swear to god hater open their stinky little mouths and don’t stfu… ugh… 🧐😒🙄…. Anyway another good song 🥳😜♥️♥️♥️💅💅💅)
I’m also petite it’s awesome to see a black rapper who is as well. Coi is literally adorable 🥰

"Coi Leray" is that girl to me regardless!!! 😝 This collaboration was "perfect" from start to finish! She took the time to hoop on this song/video which takes time from her husband and her baby boy so I give her mad props for doing that! 👏👌🏆 The "Queen of Rap" "showed major love to Coi Leray in a major way! if u asking me...

Open debate. How are you gonna promote gun control, yet make art like this about guns to be interpreted by the masses? Just a question ya know.
This should be nominated: worst sh*t of 2022! This shouldn't be even categorized as music.
coi leray sounds like shes reading infront the class and shes stuttering
There is something undeniable about Nikki's voice and cadence when she raps that puts her in the Iconic Legendary category of female...wait let me not limit this one, of all rappers!  She's got that Busta style and cadence that as soon as you hear the voice it's like Nikkiiiiiiii  😍😍😍💚💛❤️💖💓 there's no confusion her voice and style with anyone!
I'm watching your every move until u show me that's not what u want. 💯
My Two Favorite Artists 💪🏾💓😉 this beat is so hard 😍

Coi and nicki are the fuckin bomb 💣
If beastiality, poop, or puke content is popular in the underground scene, then the industry would start pushing it into the new meme. It's only a matter of time before the slave trade starts pushing the depravity of the addicts with money or power who believe they are demons.  You're neither a demon or angel, you're simply human. Whatever transcendance you think you're going through, has already happened when man used to worship idols. What followed through was restriction and for good reason.   Stop creating a large chaos effect that will lead man to go back to the age of fighting heresy. You have your freedom enjoy in this age of slavery.

-Her confidence speaks so loudly... A slim female artist with NO work done is RARE and I'm appreciating it. Just being herself & embracing her naturalness. If "work with what you got" was a person 🙌👑😍 With Nicki, I'm sure they had a fun time shooting the video.

Ion see why people even like Niki manji still. She stupid asf. DO YALL NOT REMEMBER WHAT SHE DID??? She bothered  the woman that was raped by NIKI'S HUSBAND.  NIKI TOLD the woman to tell the court that she had never been raped, Niki said she'd pay the woman. THE woman refused to lie about what niki's husband did to her when she was younger. The victim was forced to change her adress due to Niki's threats her. NIKI IS NOT THE QUEEN OF RAP. NOT ANYMORE. NIKI KNEW THAT HER HUSBAND WAS A RAPIST BUT SHE STILL HAD A KID WITH HIM.
Shout out to all the rapper out there
Now I see why my cousins hate you
Lil coi did her thang it ain't always about the ass it's def about the delivery n she delived well

Nicki Minaj is a lyrical genius
This need to be on 2k23 lol
Tell me why Coi Leray sounds like Cardi b?
虽然这次nicki再次反客为主，新人Coi因为很想把这个单曲唱好而过于关注flow的问题，导致blick blick押韵有些刻意。而nicki的vers就非常大方自然，希望nicki能多给新人小妹一些说唱技巧，新人未来前途不可小觑。
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Okay she looks like she is sick ballimic or a sick with it tweeker....and she also looks like she is 12 years old , so it was a little bit nasty watching her do sexual things with her 10 year old boy body!

Nicki saved the track
i love kpop girlz
No this is a good song but it is also so bad at the same time😂😂😂❤sorry
These girls are perfect
Nickis rap is on another level especially the first verse
Both went so hard
Coi lorray ate and nicki SLAYED both sound great nicki is the Queen of Rap
This hard fr! If y'all fw music like this lemme put u on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RTtfMXrHcIc
Coi leray/Bia real original, in a lane of their own. 😏
I really think it's time for nikki to start being more selective. This artist is ridiculousl.  A 2 min song with a feature? In my day a 2 minute song was a prelude.
bro I don't know why but everytime I see coi leray I see the alien from MIB
anyone else love Nickis boots.<3
Nicki in the pink bob where she says “chunky Barbie” I just wanna eat her up 🥰 ❤️ so freaking cute lol

Yell think Benzino was trying to protect her from this industry? After I saw the video for her song Anxiety, I picked up on all of the symbolism, especially the cage.
She kinda reminds me of honey cocaine

Idk why mfs hating so hard but this song hard stfu 🤫
Why does nicki look like she was forced to be in this by her manager for a quick check. She showed up moved a little and left without smiling 💀
Horrible not even music
Nicki Minaj is a great rapper but she still has work to do to reach the level of Coi Leray
Coi and Nicki Are the BEST combo❤
so when a woman acts like this its being strong and independent, but a guy does it and hes an asshole?

Uhhhhhhh
Jesus fucking christ coi leray is a bad rapper
Coi need to eat
ooi will sell in Asia Korea Japan and could actually be a diffrent kinda cross over, shed have to stop with the over sexualized bullshit rhythms cause they aint going for all that but here stop it her verse was trash the beat good but she tryin to hard and its not coming off as genuine or maybe its me ad rap is just black women putting themselves on an auction block to be sold  EVERYwoman in rap /hiphop is now over sexulized in no other genre is this happing, name one. ONE rap/hiphop main stream artist who DONT show they ass hell. even Beyoncé show me 1 video of 1 female ap hiphop artist where they not showing ass   this shit is sad
My 2 favzz together 😍
I’m in love coi leray😻👍
If she is more fat then .... 🥰🥰
The song is number 1 in I tune..
Like this song, girl power…
NICKI SHAVE THIS SONG 🥵
They both fine as hell 😖😖😖 I’d go lesbian any day 4 them 🥰
Coi Leray seriously bodied my idol Nicki Minaj in this song -Honest Barb since 2007
Wrist on chunky barbie jus changed body shaming for half the fucccccckin world
Bias sis
hello to those who read this, I take 1 minute of your time to tell you that Jesus loves you with all his heart and that he calls you to follow him, because he loves you so intensely that he is put on the cross to wash away your sins because he loves you more than anyone in this world and Jesus Christ has a plan for you and know that he is coming soon and this world of depravity is over the point of disappearing
I love coi I love this song. But I love coi she is so sexy can't wait to meet her and I'm in her borough
I love how nicki mentioned Puerto ricans. Means a lot cuz most rapper doesn't mention PR🇵🇷❤
Накормите её, на неё смотреть страшно

Nicki's verse is fucking insane. Her word play, her swagger and her delivery were all flawless. She is really slept on as one of the best rappers of all time.

That x line kinda sus with the dudes in masks being behind her, also the one dude has a forhead tat like the guy that shot x....hmmmm very flabbergasting indeed
I SEE A LOT OF POTENTIAL IN COI LERAY, I CAN RELATE TO WHAT IT'S LIKE TO HAVE PARENTS THAT ROOT AGAINST THEIR OWN CHILD'S SUCCESS, IT'S VERY UNFORTUNATE, BUT SHE DEF HAS TALENT!! keep your head up girlie!!!
The Illuminati got coi in they’re pocket now🤷🏻‍♀️ but besides that nicki bodied her part though
This track would of gone harder if nicki was her old self. Drop lil Kim in this and it would be a hot 3 chick track! Probably hit top 1 billboard in the first 24 hours
Best song in the album.

I honestly love Coi's part only😐

So cringe🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤢
2 month of my beard grow
Nicki's flow is as good as ever.  I hope these younger artists are learning from her and how she uses different rhyme cadences to bring out the best in songs. Having said that . . this song is easily forgettable. Definitely not timeless. I want Nicki to get back to making timeless music, not disposable music that will be forgotten in 4 weeks.
Now THIS is the Nicki I remember. I fucking love her. There's no gender when it comes to rap. You're either a boss, or you flat out blow fake smoke. My love for rap and hip hop runs deep. I've never heard of Coi until now, and I'll definitely be checking out more of her stuff. Pop off ladies! 💜
I love how they get away with no talent
She so dam Bonnie but she is fine az hell

Someone order this girl a pizza RIGHT NOW.  She about to float away.
Let’s be honest the roll out of blick by itself pretty much ruined the rollout of her album . What benzino did was messy af , I honestly feel for coi too. If he didn’t do what he did , she would be making them numbers , nicki opened a door for her but benzino closed it on her . She would’ve been a mystery but because he did what he did everyone already knew that they had a record coming out .

3 But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints; 4 neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks. 5 For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. 6 Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience. 7 Be not ye therefore partakers with them.

I love the verse Nicki's
I’ve never seen someone look so cute in braces in my life before 👀  Also Nicki never fails to deliver straight 🔥.  And I know Coi gets a lot of hate especially after that Freshmen cypher fiasco and performing to a completely disinterested crowd but there is something about her I can’t deny liking, I think she’s got talent and is unique and just needs time to grow as an artist
👎👎👎❗

Okay I see a lot of comments talking about how Nicki’s the GOAT and blah blah blah and I am just sitting over here confused af. She’s good, can’t deny that but GOAT? Queen of rap? Stop it. Her bars are not that complex. She’s not making you do a double take on her words and then realize what she just did. Her flow is good, her sound, but bars?? They aren’t immaculate like why the exaggeration? I truly don’t get it…but to each their own I suppose. But go Coi!!! My baby doing her thing!! 😩😩😩😩😩
I love Coi so much
Coi is so sexy 😻
She's really not picking the right people to be featured on like she needs an a&r person

Girl you need feeding... Real talk.
Nicki lil cousin lol
And you see why the world's mess up  some  womens out here   watching these type of  videos like women's looking down on other women because they listen to stuff like this but that's not the only video raising taxes was going on Ukrainian and other country the bible  not lying oh I see I've been seeing it
Damn!!!! Goosebumps 💯💯💯
Keep going coi!!!
Go Nicki Minaj
Go Nicki
I'm here for Nicki 🥰
Coi Leray MARAVILHOSA  que poder 💜👿
Crazy how Nicki is one of the goats and saves the track
If fivo doesnt hop on this remix. Thats just plain wrong !!!
This is good 👍😊❤️
I love everything bout nicki verse but both killed it 🥰
You don't have to be a big Coi Leray didn't write these lyrics 😂 this has never been her flow type. Lemme find out Nicki heard her original lyrics and changed her entire shii 😭
I like her. I don't get the hate.
I feel bad bc ever since DWHAP I was not feeling my sis Nicki, but she really ate all these songs they just had to grow on me ...she have enough ppl against her chile I can't be one of em
Why’s nicki holding a sniper like that ???😂
I'm 'bout to put some Louis seats inside my Lambo'  You know you bad when you can pose from any angle He said he upgraded, LOL, did you really?  Well, I just turned Mr. Patek into Richard Millie 🔥
Yes love this Coi La ray did the dame thing, with this.!👍🔥🔥
I'm just  a fan of  her and Nikki  m  just love them so much  💓
Puertorriqueña 🤣💪🏽🇵🇷
Maybe she should stop thinking of d**k!! An maybe eat a hamburger!!!! That's not skinny that's unhealthy!!!

NAEVIS APPROVED ✅
Hell yea!!! I'm feeling this shit right here💪🏾🔥🔥
Love coi Leray part 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I don’t care for this song.. but if the video was better I would’ve been able to tolerate it better. Nicki is a pro at this, and this looked like it was her first video.. what happened??? They should have done like a Kill Bill theme. That would have been 🔥

Man, I wish women could actually get recognized off of the content of they’re music and not just they’re sexuality. Coi could be a great artist, but she needs to give up the whole Nicki Minaj, Meg the stallion act and prove herself through bars. Miss the days of Lauryn Hill and Lady of Rage. Real queens 👑

Love ya Nikki Thanks for being a part of my life

tradition lalisa😳😳😳😳😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠
Yessss boo boo 🔥🔥🔥
Be original
The LALISA reference 👀
4 seconds in and i already see that she copied lisa😭 please be more original.
Coi leray is gorgeous 🥰
Trying to get fame out of other artists... this is embarrassing😭 couldn't you try to be more original? Idk who did the MV but bye-
Yo she ain’t gunna do nun stop playin lol
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Is anyone on here light skin and a boy who's 13 and with blue eyes,and blue braces
i think those blink say she copy lisa maybe she take as insparation plus stop assume people copy 100%? is not just 20% only what i see on this video.
I love how Coi represents for the small booty  community! I hope she stays naturally beautiful 🥰
i wish nicki made a guest appearance on empire. It wouldve been interesting seeing her interact with cookie
i love
Not her copying Lisa
Why is Nicki featuring with this nobody
This is trash
Absolutely 🗑
The staring setup is similar to LALISA mv set ...is not it ?No hate 😊
If she pulled the trigger the recoil would snap her bird bones in her arm!
17 m today ? let's goo
Yea There a real credit to there race
like MV LALISA :)
YALL SEEN WAYNE 🤟😅
Nicki love you.I'm from India 🥰
This song is Nikki’s style but Coi’s versatility is amazing. She can do it all
I genuinely can’t see how people actually like this. Like the music isn’t that great, their verses were alright they talk about the same thing, and the industry has been exposed. Yet people still choose to listen to this? It’s a joke honestly. 🤣💀
Damn nicki is bad here
I never shot a #Oger #JailBlock😐
Kids don't do drugs

Nicki Minaj is really the only female rapper that could disappear off the face of the earth for however long she wants and still have people waiting for her return and desperately wanting new music, that’s powerful for real.
Shit is cringe………..
Coi and Doja should collab 😩

This song would go crazy if gunna was on it
My yt recommendations are terrible
queens 😭💞
https://youtu.be/-uzTO4q3qn0
woo that skeleton twerk..
This song should be number 1!
This song is horrible in regards to good music but glad she got on. She has star quality hope she can make sum better music in the future.
I've definitely underestimated Coi based on her terrible cypher. But I realized that she's not a off the dome freestyle rapper. Just like Nicki she's a writer with mastery in flows and delivery.
This song is fire. Blick Blick 🔫
who else just came here to see kane?
im still obsessed w this one omg
#QueenOfRap #Barbie 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷

Nicki Minajtwa looking like she knows that's her younger side Coi Leray bout to take over, .. Nicki's eyes looks like she overthinking her status, .. Lord have mercy on our younger doubles in Time Travelling, .. 📝 💭 🤔
Coileray is my dream girl 💜💙😘🥺💛
Awful, looks like a bunch of crack users
Coi L or w.e. is trying so hard I do not think she is good, trying to be doja cat in a way in my opinion,  but nicki minaj get it !
Salaam alaikum parvez

please eat some thing
It’s like Nicki made a song with her daughter, out of pity. Outshined her !
I love that Coi Leray is different than the average female rappers that we have grown to see. She is natural and cute af. I hope she never changes it. From straight bars to fashion 🧡Nicki never disappoints
she reminds me of lil tay 🤣😂 she need to stop seriously and out clothes on
I'm sure Benzino had her well taken care of, so this gangsta shit from Coi comes off faker than Nicki's body. She bit Nicki's whole style to go with it. I'll pass
This hard again Coi Leray
Say what you want but this girl is pretty! Like really pretty and so natural. Why do people hate coi so much she’s beautiful
I’m here for Coi killing choreography along with her dancers! Bish ate down
She can made any songs, and she choose this
Well, that's 3 minutes of my life I won't get back. She can rap about as good as her father and that ain't saying much. No wonder Nicki always features with artists who can't rap. They make her actually sound good 🤷‍♀️
✨✨✨🔥
wow u such a good rapper !
PUSH DROPPED A BAR BOUT THIS “ buy a bitch a Richard Mille if she like Meeks , let no nigga claim rich and let him buy you sneaks”
who’s just here for nicki lmao ✋🏼
NICKI ATE
Ironing board
they ATE
O terror do rap junto a dona do rap ❤ o verso da Nicki salva a música da falência
Ameiiiiii 🇧🇷❤️
@1:00 if when you were never gonna give him yo # Y would allow him to smash?!?!? That makes no sense also it's not a flex for a woman to get intercourse any woman can get it easily!?!
Bombaaat🔥🔥🔥

1:52 i love how nicki said “R I P to x too” that made my day
Slap
Ayooo, I'ma nigga. But that part when she say "fucked that nigga and never gave that boy my number". That's kinda hard, make me wanna be a bad bitch haha

Wish she didn't have to show it off so much, but shout out to Coi for representing us small chest skinny women who still can twerk it like were packin'. Just hope a year from now she hasn't conformed to the current societal norm of woman in hip hop with huge fake tatas & cakes. Not knocking the ones who do, but stay true to you for its gotten you this far. Love how Nikki can basically just stand there, spit 🔥that she wrote, & look gorgeous doing so.
The more I listen to this song I love it no lie 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
💩💩💩
Hello Nicki glad to see you again
Coi leray is trash, but megan the sloot is way more cringe.

I love thin females they be throwing that lil thang yassss
My ego dont want to like coi but this song goes hard. 😑
Loki this shit was fire I thaught it was GONA be ass👏👏👏 congrats RAY “with respect of course”
Trash
Coi Leary sway is unmatched to me she so fuckin raw !
So literally the same music, rapping about puss@y and busting it open while throwing the word Blick around? Gotcha
Coi is the kind of success story that encourages me as a underground artist with a small following. Seeing how he’s developed his skills and slowly blown up after seizing each and every opportunity he’s been giving has been inspirational! Mans has quickly become a mainstay in the industry and for good reason. Dude is too nice! I know if I put in the work, I can reach a larger audience some day too, but for now, I’m happy being a supporter. My turn will come too. Salute to Coi🔥
Nicki 😍
I really love coi part🥰, she getting her flowers and love her confidence also.
I just need 2 minutes of your rime, you won't regret it lol I hope. #GodBless #WillJada https://youtu.be/wmUfMc2nEvI

God loves you and has a wonderful plan for your life.  If you were to die this very second,  do you know beyond a shadow of doubt,  that you would make it to heaven? The Bible reads for all have sinned and come short of the Glory of God and for the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. The Bible also reads, FOR WHOSOEVER SHALL CALL UPON THE NAME OF THE LORD SHALL BE SAVED. And we are all whosoevers.  If you would like to receive this gift that God has for you today, please say this after me with your heart and lips out loud. Say,  Dear Lord Jesus,  come into my heart, forgive me of my sins. Wash me and cleanse me.  Set me free. Jesus thank You that You died for me.  I believe that You are risen from the dead and that You're coming back again for me. Fill me with the Holy Spirit. Give me a passion for the lost,  a hunger for the things of God and a holy boldness to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ. I'm saved.  I'm born again.  I'm forgiven and I'm on my way to Heaven because I have Jesus in my heart. Amen. (please like or comment if you said the prayer)

Coi is just so cute💖😍love it !!!
That girl sounds a tad like Doja wow.
I love this video because it's throw back to all the young money artists. It's a Lil Wayne refence because her first outfit has a snapback and sunglasses. It's a Nicki reference cause the second outfit has the pink wig. And it's a Drake reference because Coi Leray is light skinned and corny.

Love coi leray

This girl got talent, madd skills.  Great rap collab with Nikki Minaj.  I didn't know Benzino had a daughter.  I do now.
Why she look like a 14 year old boy?
Why is the industry pushing this girl she so trash...
So beyond nasty and so vulgar.
Coi sounds like Riley from Boondocks when she says yeah
2:58 ain't enough....
Natural Body women.  .   . I love it. Niki...OMG . ... Yesssss.

The beat go hard
These women are Jezebel spirts. Young ppl please do not be deceived by the enemy. The devil comes to seek whom he may devour. Stop following the world and these celebrities who follow their father the devil.  Jesus ALONE saves and He is coming soon. Believe in the Lord Jesus and how He died for you so you can be saved and have eternal life. He paid for your life with his life's blood...your body is not your own for it was bought with a price. Follow Jesus ALONE ...HE IS THE WAY, THE TRUTH and THE LIFE, NO ONE COMES TO THE FATHER EXCEPT THROUGH HIM....John 14:6

Imagine the number of people who come here every day to hear this music; it's legendary!! I can't get this song out of my head, and the video is fantastic as well ❤
I like  the song, but 1 she too skinny feels like i am looking at a 12 year old 🤢. 2 don't like her with the durag and hat not sure if she is a les or not. 3 Her clothes are way too big. 4 Dance moves are atrocious. She is all over the place in this video. 😬
Coi bodied this song...Nicki...it's different!
Bunch of bull shit rap
Nicki Minaj's never disappoint
Always watching 😚
I really love this song
LOL 11k first week is A L
Nicki is not the queen cardi b is the queen of the rap
Lil Wayne made a cameo at @2:35 😍

If she was thick she'd be a 20
So is Niki

I bet her dad benzino is feeling really salty right about now.
srsly nicki killed it her verse is fiire🔥
They killed this. Had to replay Nicki's verse 5 times she went in fr.
Why they reppin transgender colors thooooo pink and blue?
🔥🔥
🔥
The flop
I love Coi! I hope she never changes, ANYTHING! You can tell she's an authentic person 🔥
They should do fortnite promotion. This nicki look would a awesome skin
No song that has Nicki is going to be  bad her style is what make her th3 queen
This shit is awful mdg
why do she look like jessica  the prankster tho
too skinny and too FAT
how did it feel to carry a baby and then carry multiple songs
Nicki still go hard
😂😂😂
❤️❤️❤️❤️
0:20 😂😂
It’s like two totally different productions filmed each. Nikis half is significantly better.
Coi is both sexy and so adorable at the same time. Love her look and love how naturally beautiful she is. Women don't have to be fake to be stunning. Coi proves that. ❤ Honestly her other music is fire without a collab. Anxiety is really great and showcases her voice imo. I love how beautiful her voice is and loved the esthetic for the vid.
THE QUEEN!!!
so is she half asian and half benzino?
Coi redeemed herself from that freestyle! This is fire!
up
Still stranding after 3 weeks
Go go
this song is a vibe bro Fire
This song and “Did You Call Me?” by Lukaz just hits different in early 2022. Times may be tough but everything going to be okay in the end. I hope everyone is doing well. I love you all! 💜💜
thank you queennnsss
Good workout song 🙌🏻
I actually was thinking that I wouldn’t like this song, but it works! Happy nicki is still collaborating with female rappers
All I gotta say is her as confused...
Only two weeks on the charts! Why...
This for all the haters that said I couldn’t be a Barbie cuz I’m chunky but baby we exist. Sooooo what yull gone say now. 😂😂😂
These fucking ads are getting on my nerves 🤬
1:28 Like if u come from Putin Drag video on TikTok :'v
Way better than your other shit  Coi
I should get compensation for the trauma my ears sustained hearing this queeffffff
She looks she could be Bias' little sister. 💗
Got to respect Nicki for rolling out the red carpet for new artist her Trina and a few other female icons really display their legend when they do stuff like this

Y’all gotta stop a these meaningful comments about coi .-.
COI IS A STAR!!!❤❤❤
Love all of Coi's looks in the video!!!  Super cute!!!
Coi is cute but low key built like a worm from men in black

I love you Coi live your life girl ❤️! Also ❤️ this link up!

Omg we need this Nicki in Fortnite pls💕
Horrible
Nicki, please fire whoever installed that blonde and black wig. They put it canted on your ass.
🔥 Hacking Babes 📱 😆
the brazilian energy Coi Leray exhales is insane
It’s sad, they put a wig and make up on a little boy and everyone falls for it.
2:04 sounds too iconic
OMG. OMG. OMG FLAWLESSSSS
The "Me ONIKA TANYA!" always gets me🔥🔥😩
🥴🥱..please let this noise go away call me nostalgic ol head w/e. At 30 years old I mich rather 90s rap. None of these white noise cuz damn sure can't call it songs are timeless. There's so much music form 70s to now that we can play and feel good about. This is so cringe I'm sorry all these years Nicki had no growth. Coi sounds like a bubble gum rapper
I like this song. Good job ladies
Nicki Minaj 🔥🔥 the 👑
the queen really said "i created this shit, tyler tyler tyler¨
🇺🇸🇲🇿🔥
Natural Beauty❤️🔥

SO ASS. SO BAD. LIKE NO EFFORT PUT INTO THIS ELEMENTARY BS 🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🚮🚮🚮🚮🚮

I don’t care what anybody says but coi is soo fine 😍😍😍
That Dior bra looks painful girl 😭
OKAY I SEE YOU GIRLS
Coi repping for the for us slim women 🥰
Coi is such a sensual gangster 😍💕
🔥🔥🔥👑👑🔥🔥🔥
The Nicki we know and love 😍
Coi ran that shit 🔥🔥🔥
Good video I'm so happy Nicki taking her under her wing they work good togather and they compliment each other in this video
The queen of rap👑💅
Why does this has so many dislikes?
Horrible!
It’s Coi for me baby!!!
Nicki real baddie 😻
COL'S!  Remind me of  niece hunni!  If she continued to grind she's going be it🔥🔥
Purr!💅
Tied of nicki
R.I.P to X too
1:43 this part is the best
It's not for me nicki's part was good. Coi is unsettlingly skinny very distracting but I've heard worse
Boring sounds like everyone else. Just another artist created by the industry not impressed. Props to Nicki doing the feature sure that wasn't cheap!
13 million views 👑
COI is almost DOPE AF!!! but she doesnt put enough effort into her verses. Plus noone wants to su*k on a dude like that so pls.
Coi is not cute, but she’s talented. Nicki is a queen. Always 😍
Nicki verse tho 🔥
clap clap👏🏿👏🏿 clap clap👏🏿👏🏿 clap👏🏿❤️❤️
Y’all hate to see it but Coi is thee moment! I’m so impressed how she really put all this energy into her music vs the hate. Now or Never sold me. But this new pressure being applied is soooo good to see. Inspiring asf. 🚀💖
Love them both 💜💜
the poor rap game gon to shit 💯 i cant believe nicki even tapped into this trash of course she saved this song tho !
In terms of "iddy bitty" and "big ole big ole" they like Laurel and Hardy...
Uhhhhhhhh ♥️👅🔥
Its 🔥
And mfs still comparing Nicki to Cardi smh 🤦‍♂️
Didn’t take long before “gucci” and “nigga” we’re mentioned. Black artists are really obsessed with those 🤦‍♂️.  Cringe

Are you bumpin this in your hood???
Nicki Always Come Thru 😭😭😭🔥
The confidence you have to have to stand next to the GOAT says that you have the “it” factor. Nicki matching the cadence in the end really sealed the deal. Love the wigs. Coi you doing it. From the people 40 and up. Lol
Bits size snack with a whole snack!
It was the wrist on chunky Barbie fa me 🔥🦄🛸
That's the only COI song that i ever listen and it's because of Nicki. Nicki never disappoint me. Good job 👍🏾
Nice sh*troom music. 👍👍
I think if someone is watching this song video then its just because Nicky Minaj is in there
hmmm its not bad but its mmm
I love Coi 🤍😞🙏
This is shit water
Coi's voice like Cardi B's voice.😊
GenZ is ruining music. No creativity or originality. Just talking about the same thing over and over again. This is pitiful.
Chunky barbie nice
BLICK BLICK

I keep coming back ❤️❤️❤️😂😂
🔥🔥🔥🔥
It's cool and all until someone really push the click and go blick blick on you
I just can't "feel" this hook especially rapped by a  "person" that looks alot like a pubescent boy 80 pds. Soaking wet, talking about how she got real "ops" , spinnin blocks ,and  pullin  up on 'em and makin it "blick blick" with a pole!!! 🤦‍♀️😂🤣😂🤣😂🤦‍♀️🤡.  Nicki's always on point though and of course had to "make" another song that she was supposed to just be the "feature" on. Sad ., I l enjoyed Nick's flows at least tho 🤷
WHT HAPPENED TO HIP HOP
That lil lady is throwing them lil cakes hard and ain't mad at it.

Two gorgeous bad queens 👸🏽 👸🏽😍❤️
I love both artists. Coi Leray went off here but Nicki's verse just feels a little phoned in. Wasn't really memorable
This song too lit
Coi had to step it up being on the same track with the Queen and I'm proud of her cus that means she does have talent and she's not a mumble rapper! #GoCoi #QueenNick #MyBabes

I DNT CARE WHAT ANYBODY SAYS NIKKI CAN RAP BETTER THAN CARDI AND CORI IS JUST SO SEXY
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥Dope
coi consider bia, y’all would eat together
Coi brought the style, dancing, and the flow switch up 😍😍. Nicki also had bars. Good combo. Coi held her own though!
I’m sorry I just don’t find Coi impressing 🤣🤣🤣
I love that she from Boston. I love that she cute. But The dudes she hang with though are like D listers and she slick annoying but I’m hoping the best for her career.  She’s better looking then most.
Nicki looks amazing as always
🔥🔥🔥
‘Cloy-Reece’….’CloyceLeRoyce’

Y say  Uuuuuugh!
GREAT MORNING  QUEEN COI: I FIRST NOTICED  HOW CAPTIVATING YOU ARE ON "WILDN' OUT"  AND MORE DEEPLY ON THE  "BREAKFAST CLUB" INTERVIEW, THE HIGH POWER ENERGY IS DOMINANTLY POSITIVE AND CHARMING. I THINK YOU HAVE A COMPLETIVE EDGE THAT WILL BE VERY HARD TO REPLICATE.. EXPRESSING YOUR OWN UNIQUE INDIVIDUALITY IS THE KEY TO  REAL CREATIVITY.  KEEP RISING LOVE WHO YOU KNOW YOU ARE !!! 💪🌄
COI ALWAYS LOOKS PERMANENTLY TIRED.😂😂😂😂          THIS SONG FYE THO!
I love how Nicki can switch her flow to fit with whatever artist she’s featured with 😅
what a mess, turning my mind to absolute shit.

Nicki should have saved that verse for her own song. Cos this ain't the feature to be on. Js...
Fire 🔥
glad to see someone skinny embracing their natural body. i stan Coi Leray 🥰😍
coi has come so far ngl  👏👏👏👏
I never like Coi's other music because it just didn't go with the beat to me, but this is a major improvement. I love this. 💚 Respect.
I didn't think anyone could be more trashy than Cardi B. I was wrong.
That was fun. The black dogs look great too.
🧡💚💛
This music seems sound addicted, jeezz help me, it's driving me crazy 🤪
This is straight nonsense.. this is what y’all call music¿
did she learn to dance a little or is it just me
*Coi Leray's the next big thing.*
🎀🎀🎀
a few nip slips in this video i hope coi was okay with that
Got my grandbaby singing" Uhh push it blick blick blick "🎶🎵🎶🎵#luv Barbie
Nikki getting chunky
Coi really doing her thing, I gotta make some coi leray type beats forreal
Long live X
More hoe music....great
I like it 🤷🏾‍♀️ Coi is pretty to me 🤷🏾‍♀️
Nothing against her but at first I thought was cross dresser after saw the little boobs and thought trans but goggled her and is a girl also I thought how come she uses the N word but then saw the father is black so she can. Still she looks like asian drag queen. Interesting tho. I am gay I don’t discriminate but yeah that’s what I thought…
I'm so pleased that she is flaunting her natural body as it is. 😍  don't touch what God gave you to pleas3 others.
You lit your personality everything we love you in detroit fuck the haters & you beautifull no fake page this a real fan hope you see this
Yeeeeeee this mf BANG 🗣
Nicki SAVED this song 🤞
Nicki solid for hopping on the track

Hot I love everything about this video
Nicki Minaj the Queen of rap
I really wish y’all would stop comparing these new female rappers to Nicki minaj!!! I’m a dude who grew up on 90s hip hop and Nicki is a true mc she can rap for real! Writes her own music plus she’s still relevant today! Lil Kim is my fav female artist of all time but Nicki surely has to be the most successful female rapper ever and the queen of this era! Please stop comparing cardi b to this real artist, cardi b is a studio artist they created her in the studio Nicki is hip hop!!!!
Nicki saved the song lyricwize
Uhh
Nicki Minaj is the queen of rap
Queens 👑🥵
20M let's go
I hope to see Nicki Minaj song with Lisa of blackpink
Nipple at  0:26/2:58

"Blick Blick" has now sold over 200k units in the US! Coi's new album release should also boost sales and chart placement! Keep buying, streaming on all platforms, and requesting radio play!!!

This some heat she getting it lol
🤖🌞💟💟💟💟💟💟💟🌞🤖
This song is so garbage foreal tho. This is not rap,  totally thumb down these days.  Yeah back in the day we had our dumb mindless music too but there was a balance though, today there is absolutely no balance in rap. Maybe a handful of knowledge rappers that really don't get played enough and predominantly now a bunch of mindless fuckery.
Minha energia é a coi leray dançando atras da nicki
Nikkie should just do features from this day foward.
Aaaayeeee 🔥🔥🔥
Cmon man 12 mil views? Lol bought and paid for
Coi got me liking Nicki again 😍😍😍😍😍
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This isn't wack because of Nicki.
Wt* dumbest song ever !
coi ain’t change y’all was just to busy hating on her y’all ain’t even bother to hear her music yall just like to hate.
This is my first time seeing her. I didn't know who they were talking about when they said Benzino had a daughter that raps. She puts you in the mind of Shamari DeVoe.
Why does she get so much hate? It's the first time I've heard anything of hers and then went to check out her other stuff. I don't get the negativity towards her. She's pretty dope and clearly doing her own thing and I can respect that. We should put some respect on her name. She's experimental and that's refreshing
But we ARE gonna talk bout how coi DELIVERED . On a track w the queennnnnn
Go coi I new u could do it I never doubt u100
We just did a mini dance video to this! hope y'all could share some love! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYb4CmPnVMU

Trash…Nicky’s age beginning to show too…
Nicki ran this shit up!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
period
Honest question from a novice/first time watching a  Coi Leray video, but isn't she Benzino's daughter? If so, then why is she rapping about "pulling up on an op and watch it Blick, Blick"? I highly doubt she grew up in the trenches and even if she did, she doesn't strike me as the type to be doing the heavy lifting. Surprisingly to me (again, first time even seeing her), she is actually fairly decent sounding and low key cute as hell. She had a couple of flow switch ups and tbh I feel she had the better of the verses between the Queen and herself (please don't kill me "Barbs"). I'm just a dumb man from no where so my opinion isn't valid but I feel as though she should stick to rapping about what she lived and her present experiences. Part of being a dope MC is being able to draw inspiration from past experiences and trauma and flipping it into amazing lyrical art. Does anyone else feel cringy listening to an 85lb girl that grew up super privileged/wealthy rapping about spinning the block and dropping ops? Maybe I'm alone on this but I guess I just only fuck with rappers that rap about their truth or at least the truth of something they've witnessed. Shit is corny to me when a trust fund baby pretends that she got it out the mud, then proceeds to get on a trap beat and twerks whilst simultaneously talking about killing ops. Do you but miss me with this.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ok🔥
Slay queen 🥵🥵🥵
hello doja
Damn this flopping
she's too skinny omg it just like me watching a bone dancing 3 minute straight
Ate ateeeeeeer it upppp go mf Coiiiii
This song can be the Rake It Up 2.0

Nikki does better on features than her own shit😑, I'm low key mad
Let’s get this video to 20m before this month is over
Continuem transmitindo esse hino🇧🇷🔥👑🐐
Coi is perfect for her to pass the torch too I mean it fuck everybody else They hit good and Coi sound good with a Collab or alone I'm loving her lil booty confidence young money should have signed her because she is definitely young new money taking shit over got bitches retiring before they even started fuck a horse an ex pole rider lol these girls are dope her Omeretta Rhapsody and a few more taking female rap to a string respect level while showing a lil ass too I'm loving it I'm 42 they still got me on my shit in my suit at work no lie #BarbsGang #TrendSetterWorld #AriesGangGang  #80sBaby

The Queen The flow is mad
This is the coi I enjoy. Not all that other super Auto toned high pitched ass shit
Nicki saved this song because if she wasn't on this the song would be trash. Coi's verse wack as fuck and she ain't talking bout shit.
Can't stop playing this song 🔥🔥🔥💞💞
this shit is so good..
This song ain’t about shit but nonsense but it sounds good lol
Tried to like Coi once again and I just don’t..her sound is annoying af
Watching every nicki minaj video on silent and at 2x bc she never shows her ass
Onika
Love Nikki but damn why continue to deny your Lil Kim inspired style but yet you smack us in the face with it?
Fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
New fan here
I'm sorry I respect the grind but why did I come here to hear this girl a dope rapper. 🤣🤣🤣. Some wack "bars". Nikki too. They pride themselves on writing their own lyrics. Did they pull them out a shoebox from a grade 3 writing assignment. It more pop than anything. I'm gonna listen to more but I'm being a very honest hater so far because this isn't rapping really.
No bitches??
"Want a bad bitch like me" since when were bad bitches flat chested and talentless
So Coi gets hate for being skinny but models dont? Shoot coi got more booty than most models in the fashion industry but they dont get body shamed.
❤
On  repeat man... 👽 ✌️ ✨ 🪙
Nicki the queen of flow and sound
🔥🎤🎶🎶👍💯
I'm so proud of Coi...yass boops get it Ma!
Dis shii is trash 🗑.
Nicki bodied this flow and song omg 😱 ❤️❤️
Nicki minaj is the real rap queen damnnnnnn😍🔥
this is kinda trashy tbh
I am a Puerto Rican girl and let me just say that I absolutely love Nicki’s “All these PR stunts but you ain’t Puerto Ricaña” ❤️
That girl is way better than Nicki
I love how slim she is
I'm srry not to sound like a dick or anything but ummm... Nicki saved this song ngl
Idc they both snapped 🔥

Trans flag behind them. Telling us exactly who they are.
WHERE ARE HER JEANS FROM, PLS SOMEONE TELL ME
Who hopping on top 0:34
The song is good, but Nicki ruined it.
The beat went hard but this shit was ass
This should’ve been pushed harder. This definitely needed more attention.
Nikki can RAP on anyone’s record PERIOD!😈😈😈😈Who else can do that and not sound like a joke? Hold on I’ll wait… nobody! These girls be sounding corny as fuq all they wanna talk about is WAP or how to get a dollar from a man! Raise the bar ladies!!!! Nicki Minaj is The queen 👑 of rap  the queen of all things fashion lifestyle beauty she is an innovator and she is a movement all in one person!  underestimated and under-appreciated! But her time is coming ! We need to support the queen for Warren she should have already been on vogue magazine covers numerous times I never thought about it until she mention it that is wrong as hell Anna Wintor she’s been the queen for over a decade! Going on 2 decades! Everyone needs to give her the respect she deserves!  Nobody questions Jay Z or Nas they automatically get respect when they walk into a room yet Nikki has to keep proving herself? GTFOH 😡 Start giving women the respect u automatically give a man! And start giving black women the respect that you give these white women automatically! ALL you fashion designers!  fashion magazines!  cable networks ! you see all these white girls getting all these brand deals and not nearly as many black women have the same opportunity!  give black women the respect they✊🏾 deserve! And Respect the Queen 👑

I still can’t get over this song 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Seeing a woman and a rapper who looks natural all around, without the fat injections in the hips and butt, along with no implants. It's a breath of fresh air. There's bodies real people can relate to and exist. Sometimes there's young kids who look at these videos and want to change what they have. While there's nothing wrong with changing your body and doing what makes you feel happy. It's nice to see people who are happy with their natural selves and confident. It's a message to people in my opinion, that it's ok to love yourself even if your body, and physical appearance isn't the trend that some girls follow.
so addictive ❤❤❤😢blick blick
I think y'all would say any sing with Nicki sounds good

I love that coi loves her natural body and doesn't allow men to make her feel bad. Skinny girls do get put down a lot. Everyone expects us to look like Instagram models. Like an ant.
Their repping transexual colours hard in this video 🤔🤨
Sorry but Nikki destroyed this beat 🔥🔥🔥🔥
As usual, the song comes to life with Nicki minaj!!!

Jesus loves you all so much! He died on the cross for the price of our sins. He was buried, and 3 days later he rose from the dead and ascended into heaven. He died for our sins so that we may have eternal life with him and not burn in Hell; for the consequences of our sins is death and the lake of fire. We are all sinners and in need of a saviour. If you believe that with all of your heart and confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord and that he is the Son of God, you will be saved with much Grace and Mercy! Come to Jesus and believe on him today! 🙏📖
love the video

Damn nick look tired af of  a whole trash generation that she birfed. It wasn't good before Now it's  ALL sum garbage 🗑, ESPECIALLY  this li'l boy here that she made this song with .I'm still tryin to figure out what this young man's purpose in music is besides being hard to listen to & even worse to look at OR maybe the purpose is to saturate us with more bullsh*t 🤔 🤦🏽‍♀️
Yall frrrrr ate ahahahs ehehehehe
The fashion is fire
Okay I’m sorry but am I the only person who finds it to be like distasteful for nicki Minaj to be essentially promoting gun violence and just like bragging about texting Jeff bezos and having nice cars and diamonds and shit? Like I feel like at a certain level of wealth and scale of platform you gotta switch it up and start giving back in some way that isn’t so egotistical with such disregard for the masses idk
😍😍😍😍
12 days agoles g
Why does this sound like Push It by Kevin Gates 😩
I'm loving this gangsta side of coi and being side by side with the goat it wasn't know other way but this Collab was great the original goat and upcoming future goat yea I said it I fuks with coi any day over cardi and that's on everything 💯

Coi needs to show less skin... When she shows too much skin it looks weird. She looks better with certain outfits. Revealing stuff showcases how skinny she is.

“Seek ye the LORD while He may be found, call ye upon Him while He is near: Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the LORD, and He will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for He will abundantly pardon.” – Isaiah 55:6-7 ----- God allowed this message to come cross your path today because He loves you...yes YOU. We are living in the last days of this life as we know it. Come to Jesus while there is still time. If you’re ready to make Jesus the Lord of your life please repeat this simple prayer: Lord, I admit I am a sinner. I need and want Your forgiveness. I accept Your death as the penalty for my sin and recognize that Your mercy and grace is a gift You offer to me because of Your great love, not based on anything I have done. Cleanse me and make me Your child. By faith I receive You into my heart as the Son of God and as Savior and Lord of my life. From now on, help me live for You, with You in control. In Your precious name, Amen. If you sincerely prayed that prayer, you are now heaven bound. Find a good God-fearing Christian church near you and learn more about King Jesus and His Kingdom. God bless you and have a great day!

Let's get this to 10m views
Nicki is definitely the queen. Ain't nobody bringing up cardi or thee stallion.
I’m not a huge nicki fan I mean she is the queen of this shit for sure but I think she gets a bad rep in the media sometimes what I’ve noticed & what I respect about her is she does embrace the new female artist but when she feels like or sees some shady shit with them is the only time she stops fucking with them like that as she should like Meg for instance but nicki has never been not embracing the new female rappers to me nicki moves just like Wayne like she be in her own world but when these new rappers want a feature she try to come through for them and that’s dope to me
I love !!!😍😍
American culture bores me, give us something new after 10 years of the same flow
This song is 🔥😘💖 I jst wish it was longer it's too short it has left me wanting more especially Nicki's part
Yous ain’t got ops yous ain’t shooting shit

John 14:6 Jesus said to him,  "I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me. 1 Corinthians 15:3 Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and, that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures.  Romans 10:9 that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.

I been here since 07 and what continues to set Nicki apart is her versatility and wordplay she brings each song. She murders every beat, every single feature and is the clearly the UNDISPUTED QUEEN OF RAP and a GOAT of Hip-Hop

Oh my god,i love the song,well,i'm brazilian,so i don't have problem for listen in side of my dads! I don't know if i write correct!🤗
Why Coi don’t rap this good all the time. I love her personality. Definitely believe she’s hard working, but idk wby her consistency doesn’t match them both
was she dissing pop smoke
THAT SONG IS ON FIRE
tf did i just watch
I see Nicki automatic I hit like
W
Nicki never fails to teach me something new with her lyrics. 🔥
Coi may be skinny but she can dance like hell. I love that she has her natural body and ain't trying to get a BBL even tho she would look good with one. Maybe the collaboration with Nikki is to push her sex appeal awhile back she was saying that her label wanted her to dress more sexy. She wasn't feeling that she said so they probably told her to make her lyrics more raunchy. The song straight tho.
💅❤️
This song is a smash.
Never thought I see the day coi went harder than Nicki  Love your verse/song queen  Keep pushing music coi love what you do You'll forever have my support  Ps coi killed the video She didn't just stand there 💘😻💜💛💚🧡

Still trending
I have listen to the song every single day
When I first listened to this song I didn't like it but I had to listen again and.... I like it low key haha 😂 it looks like they were having fun making this video
I think...if Nicki wasn't on this track. I would only like the beat.
If nicki was not on these song garbo
Was I the only one that noticed Wayne
Nicki never used to do collabs with other females when she was on top (2009-2015). Now her flop ass has no choice.
This song bops

PASANDO LA BLICK BLICK!
Coi snapped (BTS): https://youtu.be/BpHeYZ6B5sE
Nicki is the GENRE
am i the only one suspects that nicki helped coi with her vs ? Hmmm... i hv never heard coi rap this official.
qui   veut  entrer  dans   une  secte. Vous savez, ces  églises  ou   on  t'oblige  à faire  ami-ami  avec   tous   les  participants.  Ou  on  décrète  que la dîme, c'est 10%  de  ton  salaire.  Et  ou le  pasteur  vient   faire la   messe  chez  toi  à21h, en  pleine   semaine,  arguant   que   même   si   tu   es  en  retard   au  travail  le  lendemain, ce n'est pas  grave, que3Dieu"  va plaider ta  cause auprès  de ton  employeur, et  qu'il  cesse soudainement de  passer   quand  tu  es  licencié  pour  retards  répetés,  et donc   que   tu  n'as  plus   de   salaire, plus d'argent. Donc mon ami veut intégrer  une   secte, car, m'a-t-il dit, Nicky  Minaj  l'a  envoûte(peut-être fait-il partie  des  Barbiz, son fan club). Car Nicky, depuis qu'elle  a  explosé  avec son album "PINK   FRIDAY", n'a plus jamais broyé du   noir.  Avec le hit  phénoménal"Bed  Rock" de  son  mentor  Lil  Wayne, et réunissant  toute  l'écurie  Young  Money  , comme  Drake  ou Tyga, Nicky  a  fait la  nique à la  plupart  de  ses  rivales.Suivront  par la suite des boucheries  comme"Right  by my  side"feat  Chris Brown, et  avec  l'apparition  du king  de  Queensbridge, Nas, ou "Party  next door"  feat  Major  Lazer, un  titre au visuel   grandiose  mais   avec   des  chorégraphies  simples   comme...  un  coup  de  téléphone portable, eurent  un  succès fracassant  aussi bien  aux USA  qu'ici   au Boul, comme   disent   les  gabonais   de Bitam,   la  ville  frontalière  à  Ambam,et qui  se  dégusterait volontiers avec une  canette   de  Red  Bull.   "Chung  Li", clip  dans  lequel  elle  gravite  en  apesanteur, à  la  manière  de  Jacky  Chan à  l'époque    de  ses  grandes   cascades,et ou elle est aussi habile  que Michael  Jordan. Pas  His  Airness, le  dieu   des parquets, mais l'acteur  Michael B, dans son  film"SANS  AUCUN  REMORDS". Cette  fille, c'est une  boulimique  de taf, qui sort  des hits  à  une   vitesse  effrénée, plus rapidement  que Gerard  de Villiers ne sortait les SAS  du  prince Malko  Linge  ou que  Chester  Himes  et  ses   romans  policiers   avec  Ed Cercueuil   et  Fossoyeur. Elle t'aligne "Bang Bang"  fear  Ariana  Grande, Jessie J, un titre  qui   flingue  tout  sur son  passage, et"Trollz"  feat 6ix9ine, le  rappeur  coloré  au phrasé très  riche, et aux  multiples  références, ce  rat   de  bibliothèque.Puis "Do  we  have  a problem". On voit bien que des problèmes , elle  n'en a  pas beaucoup, elle est sereine. Car, pour demeurer une des QUEENS du rap, pour voyager loin, perdurer  dans   le  game, Nicky  Minaj   ménage  sa  monture. Pourquoi Coi Leray est-elle  si aimée  du public? Pas  parce  que son  père, c'est  Ray  Benzino, l'ancien  rédacteur   en   chef de THE  SOURCE, qui   fut longtemps  considéré  comme  la  Bible du hip hop. Non, elle le  doit  à  son  talent, tout    simplement.Elle l'a  montré  avec"Slide"  feat Gunna , clip ou  ils  se trémoussent toux  deux  dans  une somptueuse villa  qui est  tout sauf  un lopin  de terre, et qui ferait  se  trémousser  même les  lapins. Car Coi, c'est une chanteuse  au  flow énervé, et   qui, dans  ses  textes,  a  une  rage    de lupin(sans  pour autant se  muer en Arsène Lupin et  aller  détrousser  les  rupins). Toujours gracile , et souple   comme  un lutin. Elle  concocte très  souvent   des mélodies  langoureuses, qu'on  pourrait   traduire  en  toutes les  langues, en français, en italien, ou  en latin. j'en  ai   eu  la   conviction   en écoutant"No  more  parties"  feat  Lil  Durk, ou "Attachment"   feat Pressa, un beau matin. Ces  sons  ont le don  de  mettre de  bonne humeur, tout le monde, les  civils, les joueurs, professeurs, ou les matons. Alors , matons  sans  plus attendre son  feat  avec DDG and OG  Parker"Impatient"ou  elle  montre  qu'elle  est  impatiente  d'ètre   reconnue   à sa  juste  valeur, vu qu'elle  véhicule des  messages  de  la  plus  belle  eau, la  plus belle  meundip,   comme   on   dit   en Fon  le   dialecte   commun   entre   le  Cameroun     et le Gabon. "Deep  cover"  et "THE  CHRONIC"  de Dr Dr   et Snoop Dogg furent   des precurseurs  des  clips  avec des jolies filles  dans  des poses lascives. Le  phénomène  s'était quelque   peu estompé  ces  dernières  années. Mais  le  retour  de Coi Leray  montre  , por   notre   plus  grand   plaisir,   que  cette mode  n'est pas  à  l’arrêt. Ce    morceau, "Blick Blick"   montre qu'on peut  faire  un hit sans   forcément   tomber  dans  le  bling- bling, et il ambiancera   tout le monde, les  discothèques, les  pubs, bars, et même les   églises, les  sectes.

This song is WAYYYY better than I thought it would be 🤣
0:37 bruh I’m sorry but I’m so tired of shit flying under YouTube’s radar and it being okay to trend it as #1 for music. So many YouTubers get banned and videos stricken down because YouTube looks for specific ways to ban people they don’t like. I guess poppin a tit is family friendly content.🤡
This has to be one of the worst songs I've ever heard 😂
2:34 is that Wayne? Lol 😂

I came across her on Instagram. Not through anyone else. Just her!!  I predict this girl is going to be big.
Did a double take when Coi came in with that flow change up!! #bars🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥Of course Nicki came in and murdered this shit as well!
Coi leray killed this😭😭Big trend setter!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Jamaica 🇯🇲 love y’all
Coi shaped like a 12 yr old boy.  Omg.. I swear.. she give me stud vibes.. her trying to act girly is funny cuz she's so boyish.  Cute song and video tho..  P.S. Not a Coi Leray fan, I don't like that publicity stunt she p ulled acting like she was beefing with her dad to become an overnight celebrity.  Crazy thing isy⁶1 it worked.. this generation is so gullible and this internet shyt has made the youth dumb asf.. fall for anyrhing. She talked so much shyt bout him. And look they so close and he is her biggest fan.. it was all  bullshit and it worked. Got everyone talking and although her music isn't all that, she getting views.. this blick song is the best song I've heard from her.. most her music sucks.
Why does this feel like Soulja boy wrote for Coi?
👿👿🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮you  need jesus
This shit goooooo hard!!!!!!!!
On repeat 🪄
Her songs gets better right when you thought they wouldn't...Do your thang Coi 🔥

Cori drippin the Navy. Nicki battle hardened like the Army. First in line like the Corp, raining down like the Force. Camouflagin on these niggas, a Remington was my first trigga. My pops taught me it's not the size of the ship, but it's the Captain sailing it. I got my navigator, she sees water, she's trailing it.  I had to drop some bars. I just had too. This beat got me in the mood. Not looking for a collab or anything. I'm just a fan who likes ya. Didn't know about Cori till a few days ago. I'm glad I know about her now. Good shit ladies. Good shit. Nicki and her Padawan. They ain't no sith but they bringing down the thunder like Thors hammer. Beat it up like the God of Thunder. Fuck her so good it makes her wonder. This pot head needs a smoke. She be tellin all her friends his dick game ain't no joke. Alright I'm done lol ya have a great weekend. Stay safe out there. Peace!
Nicki queen

You can see the difference between the queen's verse and that benzino's daughter wack verse
Coi really improved after that XXL criticism. She came through 🔥
Saw her open for trippie redd YEARS AGO and never thought she’d blow up like this. Back then she opened the show dressed completely like a butch lesbian. Interesting to see the evolution. They both killed the track aye
yeah yeah
Who is Coi Leroy’s stylist?! Because they DID THAT!
Coi looks like a person with a good heart and the Queen came through.
Nicki never disappoints ❤️‍🔥
Coi leray is skinny but twerking better than bitches with a bbl
Okay now I wanna be skinny again 🤗
Stream no love remix by Nicki Minaj and Blick Blick 😍

Very disrespectful to people and songs trying to send a message about the violence that still happens on streets all around the US. I don’t appreciate this parody.
A positive message for our black community bravo 👏
Good stuff..
Queen of rap and issa fact, cry me a river if you disagree
0:17 please don’t do that lmao.
Love the looks, love Nicki's verse, but somehow I'm still underwhelmed. Sigh
So many pressed people stinking up this comment section…

Nicki in a pink wig will always be superior.
Can‘t stop listening 😍🙌🏼
From twitter
I like it 👌
I absolutely love this song!! I keep listening to it over and over!! I don't like some of the newer hip-hop that is out nowadays!! To me it's lost a lot of resemblance of what it use to be but this song was great and makes me feel good!! That's also why I love Nicki so much because she has always stayed true to the art!! True hip-hop is about meaningful and intelligent bars!! The ability to tell a story in their music that people can relate too! Nicki brings all the good qualities and traits of old school plus the ability to incorporate new school hip-hop by keeping her beats and lyrics fresh!! It's great to see her style is rubbing off on some of the newer artists!! I definitely can tell that Coi has been greatly influenced and inspired by Nicki and other amazing artists from the older generation of hip-hop and that's so wonderful to see and hear!! Nicki and Coi did an amazing job!! They complement each other very well!! I really hope they do another song together in the future because this song is definitely a hit!!
Congrats on 7 million Coi!!!
Nicki Minaj 💋💋😈💋💋 ☝️ love you byby 💋

Jesus is returning soon!! He is the Way, the Truth and the Life. Turn away from your sins and your past and receive Him as your LORD and Saviour right now. The Bible says that if you confess with your mouth the LORD Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. God bless.  The salvation prayer:   Dear Lord Jesus I believe that You are the Son of God I believe that You came to earth and died on the cross for my sins I believe that You shed Your blood for my redemption And I believe that You were buried and that You rose from the dead on the third day, and that You are now seated at the right hand of the throne of God  I am a sinner and I need You Lord I ask that You may forgive my sins and wash me with Your blood I repent of my ways, of my sin, and of the world And turn whole to You today  I give You my life  I surrender all that I am and all that I have to You right now  Come into my heart Lord  Save my soul Make me whole Fill me with Your Holy Spirit And enable me to live the Christian life victoriously and in its fullness  In Jesus name, amen

Damn, was not ready for no anorexic rap. Bitch so skinny her belly button turned outtie from being pressed up against her intestines. Looking like she might break a rib if she sneeze too hard.

Ouuuuuu Nice ❤️This is poppin. ❤️
She has potential. She’s just too cookie cutter atm.
I didn't even know who  Coi Leray was before this video.
I don't think Coi even wrote her own verse to this song but she definitely delivered. I love this collab.
OH MY GOD
These views need to take off now wtf YouTube 👸🏻🦄
Nicki 👸🏻🦄
When coi first starts rapping shes jocking MGK song dissing eminem, too obvious
I want listen this song in my country
Sis was twerking for her life…
https://youtube.com/channel/UCqomgAiw4Sr3dBGJ9v1opIw
Yessss I love the videooooo
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Reminds me of Pushing P
This is what mentorship is. Helping the new ones out when they need it. Nicki did a lot for Coi's self esteem and mental wellness. She really came full circle. It was not only her encouraging words telling her to pick herself up, get back out there, and keep going, but this collab is a cool song. And doing this collab went above and beyond what was expected. There's a lot of love in Nicki. It's good to see.
🔥🔥🔥
Best song of 2022
Its like Nicki didn't know her own lyrics in video. Like just fill-in scenes
This is like a feature Coi Leray🔥🔥. She usually ain't do this kinda glow on her own songs🔥🔥
Bruh this is kinda 🔥 I love it
ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
I think a song with Megan, coi, and Nicki would go crazy
ปังมากก
I Just saw Coi as an Artist. Sis Ate

All these diamond 💎 different colors
Coi is forever fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥 for this one . She building her stand in d sand for life.big up .more shows more money more awards .
5 days still trending
Pretty & Beautiful
This is just one of the many reasons Nicki is the reigning Queen Of Rap. Sales, impact, accolades and longevity aside (& obviously she checks all those boxes too) when it comes to pure talent and the art of rap, Nicki is a chameleon with versatility, bars, punchlines & metaphors for days. Nicki can jump on any track & compliment the main artist while incorporating her signature Nicki sound & elevating the song. From pop to gospel. I can’t think of one other female rapper who has consistently shown that same ability. As a matter of fact, theres only a handful of male rappers who have done the same. Male or female, Nicki is one of the GOATs, period, & should be respected as such.

Nicki went hard on this
I’ve been playing this on my YouTube music every time I get in my car I love it

This joint garbage! This a low IQ song!!!
I love you 😍
Nicky you're my favorite female rap
This is about to go off on radio.
Bombs dropping! Coi!❤

This song makes me feel dumber
Is it just me or does Coi look like a Proud Family peanut person around :30 ???
#1 whole lotta trending!!!
Nicki wrote for coi I bet lol
I love how she's comfortable and turnt with her body! Black women, even mixed are somehow always expected to be thick and that's dumb AF lol this is natural fun and comfort! There's nothing not to love! And in a world where women only feel accepted if they get a boob job or BBL this is great! Don't get pressured into plastic, you're beautiful!
Good job ladies 😉
This is so good
I say uhhh!!!
#rap #trending #nickiminaj #coileray #femalerappers

Matthew 7 : 13 “You can enter God’s Kingdom only through the narrow gate. The highway to hell is broad, and its gate is wide for the many who choose that way.  What road are you on narrow or broad.  Please Repent and live for God.
One of the Best song of the yearrrr 🔥🔥🦄🦄🦄🦄🔥🔥🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄

Coi Leray looks and body built like a pretty ass Chinese boy
Queen of rap
I wish she would make a NY track!
Seeing nicki next to her reminds me how attractive thick thighs are. But by herself coi look good.
Nicki can never do no wrong she’s so versatile and vibrant I love my Queen ❤️
When I memorize a nicki’s verse I feel like I graduated from college, that’s how powerful this woman is 💯🔥 👑
The Queen Ate
I love coi Leary
I love this song 🔥
A girl who doesn't know how to hold a gun is a loser.
Coi can dance her ass off 🔥
Nikki’s just showing off here with those tongue twisters LOL I doubt anybody will even realize how fucking talented she is, no matter how much she rules the genre she will get covered by the Volume of her work… it’s kind of like the Beatles, they literally had so many damn fucking songs that they get overlooked a lot but if you try to fathom how many catchy hits they had it’ll blow your damn mind LOL but I doubt Nikki will really get the recognition she deserves just because she’s feminine, black and better than all the men
🔥🔥🔥💣💥💢💯👌
Nikki is clearly carrying this song. Matter of Fact, Nikki one side ass cheek weighs more than Fish Coi leray
🔥🔥🔥
This is good!

She deserves to be in this music video 🤣😂😂😂
I’m so fortunate to have grown up in an era where they were real female rappers  I really don’t know what this is and I feel sorry for people if they think that this is real female artistry. My kids are gonna know what real female MC is.
Idk it's OK I guess. Here is my rating 6.5/10. Nicki saved this song tbh.
Keep streaming barbz and haters too

If anyone looks up the story of The Joker and Harley Quinn, it’s not a good one at all.. Harley Quinn was being abused by the joker.. there is a dark story about the joker and Harley Quinn.. it’s all about a domestic violence relationship.. Nicki is smart and she wouldn’t just say that over and over.. ☹️☹️ wassup Nicki
That chick tries to hard
Cardi b and nicki minaj are starting to look simular 😭

I love how Nicki is working with the newer female artists!! She has definitely ushered in the current generation of female rappers and helped open doors for many of them!! She is so influential and inspiring!! I really hope they take note because Queen Nicki is the most awarded and accomplished female rapper of all time 👏 She has made a huge impact on the Hip-hop culture and society in general!! She is a lyrical genius and all of her music is amazing so they should lead by her example if they want to be successful!!

Nicki will never not be only a feat. Crazy how she is even now feat. of younger ones. Sad that she sucks that much to only be a feat. she’s like pit bull. She’s what? Like 50 yrs old?
Mid song tbh od fan play too much 🤷🏽
She’s definitely a Queen! Her delivery always is so fresh! Always a new Flow, Her versatility is incredible… No new girl can compare with her…
Coi is skin and bone she only throwing her tail bone and spine
Another Hyper sexualise trash, ph is your only option i suppose
I love this omg
QUEENS OF RAP
Banger!!!!!!!!!!

It’s so funny to see people trying to downplay Nicki when they could literally never do what she does, after having SO many songs, verses & works of music she still is creating organic original bars & flow. Some of you hoes WISH

Ok yo no vengo a criticar como canta ni nada de eso ni como se viste,pero por qué agarro ese rifle de Franco tirado calibre .50 des cañón como si de una escoba se tratase para comenzar el calibre.50 es demasiado potente y fuerte su retroceso si para sacar el casquillo todo el cañón se mueve para atrás y además tiene mucho alcance y no se dispara desde la cintura sino que del hombro y apoyado en una base sólida delo contrario es muy probable que te disloque el hombro (no lo digo en mala onda simple mente te lo digo por si acaso haces otro video con el mismo rifle de francotirador para que lo tomes mas en cuenta) por lo demás me da igual como canta y como viste si ese es tu gusto pues que así sea por lo demás la m-60 de la otra chica esta bien solo que las balas no se le acaban pero son detalles menores, no sé si entiendes español pero igual te dejo el dato :D

Man Coi has always been this great! Folks just now seeing it. Honestly I haven't really care for much Nicki music  as of late but she got me back with this one! I'm actually put this one on my playlist. Coi needs to continue with this kind of heat.  And I like how she embrace her natural body. Hopefully she don't go and get any surgery! #BlickBlick
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
#1 Mustic Trending! Barb reporting in!
Just a jumble of words used to describe explicit sexual acts by untalented artist. In short, it is trash. There are real female rappers out there that have lyrical content about things other than sex. Lookup The Lady of Rage.

Nicki really had a whole Second look for only 3 frames( 5  Seconds maybe !!!)  in the whole song !!! She looks so cute with the pink Bob and she barely is showing it off in this video .
This song is garbage 😂😂. Idk if it was suppose to make me dance or help me get through taking a number 2.
This what I wanna see more of from Coi. Her working on her craft. Love her or hater this shit a bop, excellent use of a Nicki feature. Thankfully her messy ass daddy ain’t mess this up for her

First Visual OUT NOW 🔥🔥 Best Video Of 2022 !
Nicki Still the Queen!
YouTube holding back views. Ain't no way it's only at 4.5M views 🤦🏿‍♀️🥴. Y'all just hate to see a queen to prosper!!!
the thing she did with the hair at the "inside my lambo" part, it gives me old nicki vibezzzzz
😎😎😎
These 2 omg 🗣️💯🌹Yesssssssss
Love me nicki
I would fire my management if I was Coi because they had Nicki looking way hotter than her in this video
I love how comfortable and confident Coi Leray is in her skin. She’s so petite and pretty. I hope she always stays true to herself and never let people pressure her into changing herself.
Brrrrrrrrrpppppppppp🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥uuhhhhhhhh blik blik 🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊
I just took a min to reflect back on Nicki's career & just how long she has been dominating, not only in hip-hop, but the music industry in general! And mannn, its been 14 years since her first mixtape in '07, and she became mainstream around '09... no other female rapper has ever had this long of a career in hip-hop. & thats not shade towards anyone, its just facts... most of them either stopped putting out music or fell off. Nicki not only still has a career, but shes STILL in the Top 2 biggest female rappers today (imo still #1).  Great song, btw!
I'm not empressed although I love Nick Minaj
BODIED!!!!!
I can’t get over this song or video 😩🔥
Ok it grow on me

Me encanta que este verso tenga un video para no ser olvidado como varios versos buenos de Nicki que no son Singles
This a bop 🎯
Y’all can hate on Coi all y’all want, but y’all don’t have a song with The Queen (Nicki).

ABC’s of being saved Admit you are a sinner……………. Romans 3:23  For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; 1 John 1:19 “If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. Believe Jesus is Lord…………….  Romans 10:9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. 10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.  Call upon His Name…………….... Romans 10:13  For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.            JESUS LOVES YOU Isaiah 45:22  Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth: for I am God, and there is none else. CHOOSE HEAVEN       TIME IS SHORT
Is Nicki the best rapper out right now?   Yes, yes she is.
What is this garbage?
Yessssss love it 🤩😍🥰
Please cori don’t change your body 😍😘😍😘😍
Blick blick blick blick blick blick blick blick blick blick blick blick blick blick
That's Turble. Any talent-less fine ass woman can say dumshit & shake her ass to that beat & people will say its great.
Coi is cringe asf
Queen 👸
Coi should stop making music
ปัง  แม่นิกกี้ยิงตายโห๊ง!
Free kesha
Omg yes love this song n both of them together fuck yes
I love Nicki so fucking much
why coi gotta make them faces tho lmao. Ish is too funny and does not make her hot. Love how u can see the agenda behind the song and the content.  Knowin how hip hop really was created to keep us DOWN, now u can see it everytime. Thrown right in our faces. "pop up on the opp and watch it blick blick" is a perfect example of subliminal programming. Or "do whatever for a dolla" as well as "eff that dude never gave him my number" wtf??? its sad really
Nicki got the cake. Coi got that pie crust mmm 😛
nah:DDDDDDD
The first rapper to convince Nicki to dance in a music video
I love it

Love how Nicki kept it hot n let coi bring the nasty. Nicki just needs to just stand there, she don't need to pop nothing cus she is everything!
🥰🥰🥰🥰😻😻😻😍❤️‍🔥
Nicki carried this song on her back. When are we gonna finally admit besides Lauryn (on a mainstream level) Nicki SHOULD be compared to the men of rap. No shot against Coi or the new female rappers but they're more like pop artists. Nicki was the last real (again mainstream) female rapper.
Kill it with fire.
TAE DID MY PINK BOB MARLEY
ohhh
lets gooo
N she better not do her body
coi leray ruined the whole song. Nicki saved it . Nicki gotta stop doing songs with wack girls e.g jesy nelson & coi, there was another girl who was wack too cant rememeber. Nicki you better than to hop on this corny ishhhhh .
https://youtu.be/s40s1eXdmbE

“Rap is making singing” 😆 that’s all it took. There are currently no female rappers as I see it, Nicki and Iggy still seem to be the only ones. Cardi and Doja cat sing.

Top 10 Of The World's Funniest One Liners!  1. I can handle pain until it hurts. 2. Never answer an anonymous letter.   3. The word "gullible" isn't in the dictionary.  4. Campers: Nature's way of feeding mosquitoes.  5. Life is too complicated in the morning. 6. As long as there are tests, there will be prayer in public schools.  7. Stop repeat offenders. Don't re-elect them!  8. If at first you don't succeed, destroy all evidence that you tried. 9. Evolution: True science fiction.  10. Don't steal. The government hates competition.   Perhaps the world's most thought-provoking one-liner is "Eat right. Stay fit. Die anyway." It's sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die. This is because you have sinned against God. Let's see if that's true: Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God will never let you down.Visit needgod.com

The dogs should bite the skinny girl a**
I wonder what kind of men find that skinny woman attractive. Personally I don’t because I’m not attracted to the physique of a little boy.
I like it ❤️ sn: what Nicki does is very challenging ; she’s able to body the track with a dope flow , stay on brand with the girls as far as throwing out some lines that are simple , witty , sing a long ish … cute … but at the same time give u them BARS that make us men appreciate it on a deeper rap level like the line about guys in her DM (Then adding the X) the show love to DMX … bananas 🔥 and shout out to COI ; u got you one young queen
Coi got nicki to dance🥲🥲

Period
Nicky slaying as always
Coi leray knows how to move that little body. 👏🏼 iktr
Nicki bodied this
I'm not a fan of Coi but this actually sounds good!
Nicki never fails to slay. Queen Of Rap, idc. I did not know Coi could rap like this. They blended together so organically. 😍🥂 whole song been on repeat. Now I need some Doja x Nicki Collabs 🔥
Wow i love hiw their flow matches so smooth

Itz 🔥
yeah yeah
this song slaps me harder than my man 🔥
Xxxtentaction tried to holla @ Nicki 😂
My girls never dissapont  Nicki: " you know you bad wen you can pose from any angle" 😍I know des right nicki
Coi is definitely built for the entertainment world of music, she knows what we like to see, and the verse was 🔥on top of that. Nicki never misses, so I knew her verse was gon be 🔥 too.
Yet another inspring song for young black girls in America.
This had to be the cutest shit i’ve ever fucking seen.
This woman is 40 married to a rapist with a kid can she just go away already instead of clinging to every young rapper for relevancy?
🎀🎀🎀🎀🎀🎀🎀
Unfortunately I find the song wack as fuck... the only thing DOPE is when nicki spit
Is it just me seeing that Nicki got bigger
I got Nicki's verse on repeat
3.8 million🎺🎺🎺
It tuff mn 😍👍💯💥
Can you score 100% on this simple logical reasoning quiz? https://youtu.be/upfo0kJd5_0
She’s in her bag with this one
i love nicki but this song coi solo would be better
I actually like this lol 🔥
Oh wow
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The best collaboration ever!!! 💕😘🙌🏾
This song fucking sucks
And this plateform demonetiz a lot of creator....

🔥🔥🔥🔥
Coi know she be poppin that lil booty of hers lol we stan
Y coi weigh like 90 pounds🤺
I didn’t know if I was gonna feel coi but I do and im bumping this all summer 🤌🏻😭😭
I'm not judging anyone. I just wanted to share this with y'all. Have a Blessed Day and Night 😇👇  YouTube: Memphis Man Describes Dying, Meeting The Devil & Spiritual Awakening   YouTube: Young man dies twice and tells what he saw in the after life (Heaven & hell is real)  YouTube: Sarah Boyanga see Michael Jackson   YouTube: I'm not taking the mark of the beast, now what?  Jesus/Yeshua loves you ❤
Anyone else catch that editing glitch on Nicki's stomach at 1:43
Youngboy @2:33 🤣
The only thing they got going is thotism cause they can't hold a gun for shit. Why's everything and everyone fake asf now 🤣 hate this day and age
🤪🤪🤪👀👀👀👀👀
She's baaaccccckkkk🦄
They ate this up
I can't stop playing this song 😭❤️💖
AHHHHGHH I WISH I NEVER SAW THIS HELLLPPP WHAT IS THIS ABOMINATION
All I can think about when I see this song is Nicki asking Coi on her live is whether she is lesbian or not😂😂😂  Anyways chile!!! Nicki makes everything look good so😌🔥🔥❤
It’s her looking like Nicki Mini me with the matching pink Bobs😭💗
U need to eat more
NICKI ATE 😍😍😍🥵🧎🏻‍♀️
this shit is trash
Coi Leray is a really talented artist  damn🔥🔥🔥🔥💯❤ and the Queen killed it as always 🔥💯💙she went hard on this shit!
O.M.G 💕😍😍😍😍loveddddddd
“They run up in my DM, RIP to X too”
That is possibly the flattest chest I think I have ever seen or ever will see.  You could shoot marbles on her chest. Home girl built like an ironing board.
Coi Leray owe us a Migos feature on the Remix of this song👌😊
I just love this…Queen was drawn to Coi because she see her talent is definitely up there!!!! 💖💖💖💖💖🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Deals good
Remember when music used to be good and not just soft core porn
YUHHHH YALL ATEEE🔥🔥
Is this the Holocaust
BLICK BLICK 🔥🔥
Just seeing Nicki out here in videos and enjoying herself is everything!
amazing...
Someone feed that girl....I can count her ribs. $.20 a day to feed that child! ....but nicki still the queen
coi rlly out here repping us skinny hoes and i’m here for it
Keep streaming
Let's do 4M

Brooooooooo this my fav song 🥺💕💕💖💗 barb 4 life
yall down bad LUL the comments lool
🇯🇲🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🇯🇲🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
tha ma girl coi this a hit don't care what you say the Q let it know X is still alive r.i.p
Nicki Minaj killed her lyrics like a real Queen, texting with Jeff Bezos
And the Queen sing fast
This bout to put Coi up on another level.
this record is massive.summer gonna be lit asf.
Nicki Minaj don’t follow no one style and her song are legit like amazing
I wonder what these dancers and rappers gonna do during ww3
I’m so glad she’s still rapping after everyone bullied her last year. She really is talented.
2:39 is SUCH a vibe!
Nicki  bodied 🔥
When coi was 14... Nicki was 29... Why Nicki tryna get with shorty... That's some crazy ish
Why do you hudge me?
So it's a twerk song about killing your enemies?
Out here with WAP part 2 🤣
This song is not it from Coi. Her first verse was not good. Nicki raps well as usual but the song itself is dull and won't be remembered next year. Thats my opinion. Also why does Nicki's style look like back to her beginnings in this one? Intresting....
There isn’t anything not to love about Coi! And then Nikki to!🙌
I've taken dumps that sound better than this. It would be nice if they would actually speak English words too instead of stopping halfway through each and every single word. Mumble rap doesn't exist, mumbling does. You can't rap if you can't even finish half the song.
Nicki ily
Oh this was a complete dumpster fire.
Can’t stop listening
"Dont run up in my DM, rip to X too"  (DMX) That Nicki is clever lol.
Yeah they did their thang
This shit hard 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😂💯💯
🔥🔥🔥🔥🤘🏾🤘🏾🤘🏾
Snap that tiny thing like a pretzel stick 🤣
🔥🔥
nicki is so healthy, ghad! I'm so envy with her body TT
Yeah Ugh❤
This is not good for the youth
I’m sorry but I wasn’t feelin coi , but if this was a nicki only song , yea then that banger . Sry coi just wasn’t feeling it.
💪🏽 https://youtu.be/QiBrrc05iGc

Good stuff.. I'm a Reggae and Hip-Hop beatmaker - It would be great if you could take a peek at my channel too. Peace

This song is a smash. Loving this collab. Nicki and Coi killed it with the rap. I like how the switched with the “hol up” part
Song is cool. Shorty need a stylist. The clothes doing nothing for her petite body. Funny how she got the money for a video, but a vet like Trina didn’t, lol
😍😍

For some reason it was so satisfying watching Nicki pet her at the end loll

Not the pink white and blue flag all over the video.
I love and respect Nicki so much for saying RIP to X!! Earl Simmons is a legend and truly one of the best poets of our time 💯 He will always be remembered and know as one of the greatest!! Nicki was paying tribute while giving recognition plus appreciation for an amazing and extremely talented artist!! That shows she is very humble and has a great heart ❤ The Queen 👑👑 always gives credit where credit is due which is very honorable!! Rest in paradise DMX 🙏🙌🐾 ❤❤
Coi is turd Juice. Bargain bin rapper who was born with a silver spoon in her mouth. Wack af

1:31 is where it says Marley for the people named Marley.
Exodus 12:15-20 Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses: for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel.And in the first day there shall be an holy convocation, and in the seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you; no manner of work shall be done in them, save that which every man must eat, that only may be done of you.  And ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread; for in this selfsame day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt: therefore shall ye observe this day in your generations by an ordinance for ever.In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at even, ye shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of the month at even. Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses: for whosoever eateth that which is leavened, even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a stranger, or born in the land.Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread.
I ❤️ Nicki Minaj and I don’t care.

Never expected this duo, ngl this shi fire 🔥 😍
This is a bop❤

This hard
Ate up, nasty looking hos. Disgusting that these are young girls role models.  This is what globalist corporations want. Self absorbed, malleable, emotions based, shallow creatures. No morals or values.
Coi Leray looks like Cardi

It’s so crazy to think in 2017 I was listening to Coi’s SoundCloud and now she’s making music w Nicki! I knew she was going to be huge!
Stop lying!!! Nicki ain't never.  Get out here.
At 2:05 nikki started her verse late. I’ve never seen her mess up Or the camera crew messed some shit up. But I still like this though
Blick Blick.  Yessss.
Language: 🇧🇷/🇵🇹/🇪🇸 Vim contar uma história pra vocês, espero que gostem: teve uma época que eu estava com suspeita de câncer, os médicos disseram não ter saída e eu iria fazer a biópsia (cirurgia) só pra ter certeza do que estava acontecendo comigo, antes da biópsia MUITAS pessoas rezaram por mim, toda noite minha mãe rezava em mim e invocava o Espírito santo, Nossa Senhora e Jesus, eu fiz a biópsia e o tudo tinha SUMIDO, não tinha nada, tudo graças a Eles!! Hoje eu posso dar meu testemunho, não deixem de crer, não deixem de rezar o Pai Nosso e Ave Maria, conversem com Ele, Deus está com vocês, Ele apenas lhe espera, a atitude tem que vir de você, só basta você chama-lo! ❤️🙏🏽 E não peçam pra ele algo se vc nn vai testemunhar por isso, peçam e saibam que vc vai contar essa história e mostrar o amor de Deus para outras pessoas, o mundo precisa saber do amor de Deus, Nossa Senhora e Jesus Cristo ✨ lembrem que Deus está com vcs, coisas ruins vem pra nos fazer mais fortes e para testar nossa fé, Deus ama vc, rezem e conversem com Ele, tudo vai dar certo ❤️não se esqueçam que apenas crer em Deus não é o suficiente, porque até o inimigo crê em Deus, nós precisamos ser firmes Nele, precisamos rezar, confiar e conversar com Ele, ter uma relação com Ele é essencial! Deus, Jesus e Maria amam vocês ❤️🙏🏽 (curtam o comentário pra chegar em mais pessoas)

I think its funny that after all these years Benzino tried to squash the beef with Eminem last week because he is afraid Eminem would bury her like he did Jarule.

music///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////songs//////////2022/2060
That’s my girl 😂 😂 🎙 coi 🥶
To answer 👇 question...it's because she's garbage...and her voice is irritating trying to sound cute...and acts like she has a body...that's why..I'm sure Niki wrote her verse...Niki saved her on this 1 lol
BARBZ support "Blick Blick" by Coi Leray ft Nicki Minaj to make sure we get it on the charts! Keep buying, streaming, and requesting radio play for "DWHAP" and "Bussin" too! 🦄👑

🗑
Nicki doesn't have one bad feature!😌 She gives so much effort and thought into her verses even when it's not her own song. ♐ tingz.

I like this alot.  Came to see Nicki and I am not disappointed 💋
G.A.R.B.A.G.E
Guess I’m a hater because this is garbage I don’t know how people can listen to this and feel any sensation of losing yourself within the music plus all these female rappers rap about is hopping on dick and now they’re trying to make it sound gangster. This is straight garbage and if any of you Younghans want to listen to real music try people who play instruments together for an entire song.
Girl with the bling bling
Nicki is right when she saids you can post from any angle
I think it’s a great opportunity for Coi, but the song could be better. All in all get in where you fit inn!!!!🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
❤️
This is my 50 time watching this video!!!!! 🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄😈😈😈🔥🔥🔥♥️💯COI & NICKI BEST VIDEO OF 2022!!!!!!!
Love this song ❤️❤️❤️❤️ Periodt on blast in my car
She clearly confused
My first time hearing Coi, Love her she really has that swag, she makes the song, congrat Coi you killed it.......
🔥🔥🔥🔥 it’s a hit
That DM DMX reference went over a lot of heads your brain will need need to work a certain way to catch the bars
They bodied this song! I ❤ it. Always been a fan since day one. 👑
Nicki need to stop doing favors, this song is weird
They trying so hard with coi give up already. Lol
Queen 👑 of rap
Jus my opinion... You can be sexy but that doesn't mean the world feeling it.. I'm not w the body shame but she sets herself up
Love this song
when nicki bought it back and said hol up hol up hol 😌. this song hard 🔥🔥🔥
We got this on repeat!

What she say bout x
Lowrider✔️✔️✔️✔️
I can say confidently…we fw this 🙏🏾
Coi leroy is the only good thing benzino will be remembered for
Nicki verse was ass lol should’ve got Doja cat
1 looks like 12 year old boy another looks like had too many muffins
D Wade's daughter's favorite artist
I kinda feel bad, this song good but it’s not going to be a hit because they talking bout fucking dudes and their pussies. The flow and verses are decent and the hook is very catchy. It’s just barely falling a little short of greatness because of the lyrics aren’t as polished as they should be.
Queen
I actually liked it💛💛💛
Yooo...Coi is really growing on me and I didn't realize how good of a dancer she really is 😍🔥🔥🔥 Cute ass video fasho ❤
Coi is 🔥  with her tiny self! She spicy too
Nicki Minaj Brings Back Her Old Style The Best 💯 Fire Track 🔥
Mindless hiphop 😂🤣😒🙄
Every main stream “rapper” says the same thing in Everyyy Song 😂😂 and y’all love it!
Nicki please for the love of GOD. GO collab with Cardi b one more time
Looks like a starving African child got her dream and starred in a music video.
I thought she was Bia
Ayyyy! I love this girl! Keep growing and working smart, Coi. Also, dont let the industry make you think that your body isnt fine just the way that it is. There are millions of petite women and young girls who need to see examples like you to know that they can be sexy and stylish in the skin they are in. 🔥🔥🙂
Coi killed it
She not Cardi no mo?
SONG FROM SOME FEMALES FIRREEE 🔥🗣💍
I think Coi is cool asf. That said, Nicki put on a clinic.
Yea Coi flow on this hit different. This dope.
That was hard ! Shout out to the ladies doing the damn thang ! 💪🏼💗💗
🥵🔥
Stream let’s go!
Nicki looks amazing 💕😍
Okay!!!!!
I have the biggest crush on Coi …I’m so happy to be a Barb right now!
this is a straight up banger 🥵
This is how skinny Nikki was. Pills and potions
Wasn’t bad at all
Coi, does theme from early 2000’s tbh with mix of now! nothing wrong with that! she does it so well too
This video hard af frfr. Nice song
coi leray got a body like a 6 year old boy
They sound great together. This a vibe
It took a few listens to like the song I'll be honest . Nickis part I liked automatically like always ,  but coi's part and the hook i didn't know if I really liked at first . But now I like it a lot . Nicki looks amazing as always , I love see her dance :)
Que música viciante
A rainha do rap né meus amigos
If she would’ve gotten drake on it it would’ve been better.
Coi super cute but she a twig twig   Then Nicki come in super thick thick 😏🙃❤️
Pov: you have no idea who this is
Ain’t trying to be rude but nicki did that how u gone let nicki take over your song 😂 then her lyrics 😳then you gone match wigs wit her yea u follow follow alright
Dope
Coi is amazing.
Sooo proud of coi for ignoring the haters and kept pushing 🙌🏾 this is your season baby girl! Nicki is freaking amazing in every way
All I care about is that she's holding a 50 BMG by the barrel. holding a gun in a stupid way IS NOT badass.
This was great , I really feel like coi doesn’t get the credit she needs an im glad to actually see her come out with a banger, which she always came out with good music it’s just sad that it had to take the Queen to be on the song no shade for people to pay attention to her or for her to be likable, nicki verse was great too did a good job an looked great hope that she continues to thrive in success bc I like me some coi I think she’s so talented and she’s from my home state ♥️ keep up the good work Coi
This is bad wtf Nicki can't even save a coi song lmao
views aren't increasing
Song trash. Nicki verse fire 🔥
Ok these bitches spazzed lol shits hard
THE QUEEN  NICKI MINAJ
We should be at 8 million rn y'all sleep on another bop🥴
Ohhh! Sorry! I thought that was Nicki! It's actually Coi? A new? Ohhh..

Miss yeah Nicki! How are you now? You getting thin now😌🥺
We are so proud and lucky to live in their generation, this collab is so iconic 😌 Nicki Minaj is truly the Queen of rap, they slayed this song, Masterpiece
Nicki might as well be a doctor for some artist the way she preforms cpr on them is simply amazing!
The way Nicki rubbed her hair at the end, as if to say Job well done Daawta 💗💗

I'm obsessed with Coi's voice 🤯
Nicki looking good good💕
what the fuck
NICKI ATE THIS PURRRRR
You ever notice when short girls get fat they lose their neck? Nikki went and lost her neck 😂.. still looking good but this body modification stuff kills me .. logic is get fat and unhealthy then suck out fat from the places you don’t want it.. now your body is mismatched .. tiny waist with the cookie cutter belly button that all these “thick” girls have that looks so noticeably fake. Or.. suck the fat out and place it somewhere else .. then you have the injections of lord knows what .. or silicone as they said Nikki had that supposedly popped ..😂just be you . We as a race have become so superficial . We put health before appearance.
Coi has the body of a 13 year old boy
Yo that “Aye  hol up hol up hol up….” Shit was hard
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
THIS DUOOOOO 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Nicki coulda did better lbr. Props to coi tho she ain’t sound half bad .

Lmao this is ass nicki was good though
They aint hafta snap like this
We are all born with a sinful nature. To live eternally in paradise and escape eternal torment in hell, we must accept the sacrifice that Jesus made on the cross.  Even though Jesus is God, He came to earth to be a sacrifice for us so that we could live with Him, God the Father and God the Holy Spirit forever. We can't save ourselves by doing good works. Only faith in what Jesus did will save us. Just by believing, we are saved eternally. It can't be lost no matter what. After that, we trust God to do good works in us. It's all about what Jesus did, not what we do.  ...if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and believe in thine heart that God hath raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.                                                Romans 10:9
John 14:6 Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.  Repent. Jesus is coming back.

seen a comment that said nicki the only rapper that can change her flow & chuckled . nicki fye dont get me wrong but dont act like young thug & future dont exist
Coi would eat a K-POP collaboration. This was cute tho.
I think coi did good in the beggining until she tried to go hard. Niki killed this shit of course tho and make coi hook sound good. Niki an OG she can make anything sound good💕
Che noir, snow the product, rhapsody. Here yall go. A few female artists that have the uncanny ability to talk about more than their genitalia.    This was as garbage as I imagined it lol why Nicki hasn't rapped with them? Cause talent sells. But sex sells more . No one cares about you and pressa be doing in the bedroom lol and is Nicki talking about spinnin the block? SO MUCH CAP 🤣🤣🤣🤣 cappin in yo raps really is the wave now lmaoo
Ellla es la Reyna, nicki tiene el estilo súper copiado pero es la pionera Doja cat es la segunda xq doja tiene estilo de las demás son copias de nicki Jajja okurrrrrrrr

These days even bubblegum pop is about shootings. If you think shootings are cool you’re either really fucked up or you’ve never really been around that evil and you’re just a phoney.
omgggggggggggg
I Love That Nicki’s Doing Features! She Did So Good On This Verse! & Coi We’re So Happy For You Girly 💕 Keep Striving 🙏🏾✨
I absolutely love this song!! I keep listening to it over and over!! I don't like some of the newer hip-hop that is out nowadays!! To me it's lost a lot of resemblance of what it use to be but this song was great and makes me feel good!! That's also why I love Nicki so much because she has always stayed true to the art!! True hip-hop is about meaningful and intelligent bars!! The ability to tell a story in their music that people can relate too! Nicki brings all the good qualities and traits of old school plus the ability to incorporate new school hip-hop by keeping her beats and lyrics fresh!! It's great to see her style is rubbing off on some of the newer artists!! I definitely can tell that Coi has been greatly influenced and inspired by Nicki and other amazing artists from the older generation of hip-hop and that's so wonderful to see and hear!! Nicki and Coi did an amazing job!! They complement each other very well!! I really hope they do another song together in the future because this song is definitely a hit!!
This Nicki song tbh
The two most hated females in the industry. Its funny, next to coi, nicki looks so overweight. Is that just an optical illusion frame of reference thing bc coi is a toothpick or is nicki getting fat?
All hail the Queen Nicki!! Believe that!!!
This gaves us the kick for the weekend and all these haters will listen to this until they sleeping.
I really love Nicki but in my opinion Coi destroys this song
Flop
🔥
She is the queen and Coi
this go HARD!!!!!!!!!!
Lil durk voice on the remix would definitely eat 😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨
" R I P TØ X " 🖤🗡
wtffffff they ate🤤🔥
Rae trash nick foreva 👸🏽
Nickiiiiiiiiiii i love uuuuuuuu
This is getting too old. Its been a decade since we’ve hearing the same BS and same beat.
She finally collaborated with the queen yass!!! 😍😍🥵🥵🔥🔥
I guess coi decided not to leave the music game  the underdog has risen thanks nicki for giving her the love ❤️ & support 😍
i accidentally clinked on trending and saw this, this song made no noise whatsoever 😭💀
i thought she was gay
I now this song is coming out
I know I keep coming back but at 2:34 the dude lowkey looked like Lil Wayne 😭
This song Deserves more recognition 😢
Rip to x too😮‍💨🥲
A collab I never knew I needed. This is so good. It better go high on every chart and stick. And this video better get 100M views.
For 1 Coi’s Father is Benzino who is Puerto Rican I don’t know What’s her mother‘s nationality which no one knows I’ve searched the reason why is she saying  Nigga Nigga Nigga Nigga Until I know for a fact her mother is Black I Will Never play this song ever and will not request no one to play it  I will never support Latino women who use black women to get ahead Nicki Minaj you should be ashamed of yourself if this girl is not black allowing her to say  Nigga Nigga on a song that you’re On and she’s not a Nigga 🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️  If I’m wrong I apologize sweetheart continue to do you and keep saying the N-word👊🏾
Yazzzzzzz 😎💪🏽
Nooo 😑
Yo i fw coi lol. all that hate from people after no more parties now she dropping bangers with nicki.

America will literally make anyone famous, this is 🗑

Not all women just today women make a bad name on women today no morals and no class or respect for no one  not even for self. I feel sorry for women today they been so disrespected they think it's cool to disrespect themselves. Women today are lost and don't know which way to go in life. They  been lied to so many times even to themselves. They mess this world up it was women live but,  it's now women disrespect.
Can't stop listening to this song again and again Such different Beats..
That was the worst 3 minutes of my life
I love how people are saying the song is fire because they want likes and have an IQ of 40 . The song is garbage
Nicki tem todos flows possíveis, difícil aparecer outra igual ou melhor que ela
I love how genuine Nicki is with the upcoming female artists. She gives them a chance regardless of the clout and that's real unity. Bia and now Coi, you go Nicki!
Now that's the COLLAB ❤️❤️❤️
OMG

Ok, this is the first time I have heard Coi. I really like her. I also like how she's confident with her body. Seems like most female rappers have to have giant boobs. I like how she is rockin what God gave her. And Nicki is fire 🔥 as always.
her fake ass looks almost as bad as that girls hairline
I can imagine all these black people listening at home being like "yeee dats my queen nicki" . Its cringe asf. Worst music
nicki slayed this
Imagine thinking this is actually good music. Do these idiots actually listen to the lyrics??
Coi looks like hated enemy "CARDI B"
Love seeing Coi finally start to get her flowers. 👏🏾
Such talent to be able to talk to a beat!…Just amazing skill
🇭🇹🇭🇹😍🥰🥰🥰😍😍😍😍😍😍😍🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🥶🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋love you coii ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

I LOVE how much Coi Leray’s loves her body. She is so beautiful.
Gotta respect Nicki. Everyone copy’s her for real. And she ALWAYS steals the show as a feature.
Coi and Nicki together is a no-brainer.  First time I heard Coi and how she can fluctuate the flows, I knew she would sound bomb with Nicki 🎀💕
EVERYBODY GO WATCH FEFE, ITS ALMOST 1 BILLION !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! LETS GO!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Her havin a baby ......did her rite she look 2 fine

Coi look so cute and Nicki standing beside her made the video blend welll ,,, Nice🔥

This is my new fav song! Hook is dope, Coi did great, Nicki killed it! Coi looks sexy af n that long black wig dancing around!!!
this is good
This outfit is giving me Roman Vibe is the comeback real BABY YASSS
Coi 💚🧩✅
I've read that some people didn't like that Nicki was doing a collab w/ Coi and I'm glad Nicki payed dust to all of that. This song is 🔥  and they both delivered. People can stay hating on Nicki, but you can never deny her pen game. Time and time again, this woman just proves she is unmatched. So hate her or love her, she's still winning!!!! Congratulations on great song Ladies ❤
- [x]  Its time to get right with Jesus. nobody is automatically gonna go to heaven at the end of it, we all have lied or stolen or had sex before marriage and the punishment is hell. Jesus died so you can get a clean slate and forgiveness of future sins if you repent of them if you commit them, so you receive the gift of forgiveness by following him. When you start you have to stop sinning, and follow his word and obey it. That’s following the Lord Jesus. Read the Bible and find wisdom!!!
This shit 🔥🔥🔥🔥 they both got off
Whoever styled everyone for this video did a horrible. All the outfits didn’t flow, looked very tacky and thrown together.
Benzino daughter is pretty good wow' congratulations queen coi leray
Nope!
Is it just me who doesn't see the usual spark in nicki's eyes? She seems more tamed n bored?

Megust niki minaj
The only opps u Hebrew Israelites entertainer's and non entertainer's have is The most high YAHAWAH ancient of days creator of all things with his son Yahawashi why. Galatians 4:16 [16]Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth? to be a enemy of the most high YAHAWAH we no is insane. This is the only way u Hebrew Israelites can not have a enemy opp hater and everything else that come with keeping the ways of America. Proverbs 16:1-8 [1]The preparations of the heart in man, and the answer of the tongue, is from the LORD. [2]All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes; but the LORD weigheth the spirits. [3]Commit thy works unto the LORD, and thy thoughts shall be established. [4]The LORD hath made all things for himself: yea, even the wicked for the day of evil. [5]Every one that is proud in heart is an abomination to the LORD: though hand join in hand, he shall not be unpunished. [6]By mercy and truth iniquity is purged: and by the fear of the LORD men depart from evil. [7]When a man's ways please the LORD, he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him. [8]Better is a little with righteousness than great revenues without right. That goes for me as well if I don't come back to my true heritage and continue to seek YAHAWAH ba hasham Yahawashi I will have nonstop opps coming my way that might destroy me.so YAHAWAH is telling us Hebrew Israelites in a nut shell to get down with him or lay down with America which is hell as u can see it's going flatline. I here this alot stay dangerous against the most high YAHAWAH I don't think so.
Did I just see Lil Wayne 😳😳😳😳
This gave 🔥🔥🔥😭

To the one who has ears to hear, let him hear this message   Don’t play games with you’re soul Jesus loves you so much as you can see from what’s going on in the world things have changed and you probably wonder at times if things will Ever go back to normal ?   the answer to that question is no. God is allowing you to see just how evil this world is and you’ve seen so much that should make you think and ask yourself is God speaking to me ? Is God warning me ? yes he is and God will judge this world but God is patient with you and with all Not wanting any to perish but all to be saved   Today and even now is time of salvation make the best decision you can make in this world and give you’re life and you’re heart to Jesus Christ and accept Jesus as you’re Lord and Saviour doing so while understanding this fact that eternity is forever with no end And no such thing as time in eternity    God loves you so much God doesn’t force you to accept him but they are consequences for rejecting the forgiveness that God offers to you through Jesus who died for you as a sacrifice for you’re sins   God wants to forgive you and save you but you need to stop running away from God the bible says all have sinned and are guilty before God but loves us so much that he made a way for us to be saved   the judgement of God is near with all that’s happening in the world the earthquakes the volcanoes the vaccines it’s obvious that something is going on and you need to get right with God because you’re sins separate you from God. God doesn’t want you to Go to hell which Is why Jesus died for you In you’re place paying the price for you’re sins   receive the forgiveness of God in Christ Jesus today   John 3  For God so [greatly] loved and dearly prized the world, that He [even] gave His [One and] only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him [as Savior] shall not perish, but have eternal life.  Whoever believes and has decided to trust in Him [as personal Savior and Lord] is not judged [for this one, there is no judgment, no rejection, no condemnation]; but the one who does not believe [and has decided to reject Him as personal Savior and Lord] is judged already [that one has been convicted and sentenced], because he has not believed and trusted in the name of the [One and] only begotten Son of God [the One who is truly unique, the only One of His kind, the One who alone can save him].   This is the judgment [that is, the cause for indictment, the test by which people are judged, the basis for the sentence]: the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For every wrongdoer hates the Light, and does not come to the Light [but shrinks from it] for fear that his [sinful, worthless] activities will be exposed and condemned  . But whoever practices truth [and does what is right—morally, ethically, spiritually] comes to the Light, so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are—accomplished in God [divinely prompted, done with God’s help, in dependence on Him].”” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16, 18-21‬ ‭  For the wages which sin pays is death, but the [bountiful] free gift of God is eternal life through (in union with) Jesus Christ our Lord.” ‭‭Romans 6.23  2 Peter3   9The Lord is not slow to do what he has promised, as some think. Instead, he is patient with you, because he does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants all to turn away from their sins
yb way better
Hell yeah!!!!
Coi Leray was falling off before this song released no cap. This can keep her in the game for 2-3 months but she needs more songs like this Fo sho 💙
Yeah this bihhh slide 😮‍💨💪🏾🙏🏾
I knew this was gone be fire with Coi sound and Onikas flow, but dayum I didn’t know they would eat all the rap bytches the way they did. 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The song is so Barbie 😍💞💅
Nicki and coi ateeee

Seit langem nicht mehr so eine Scheiße gehört
The trendsetter X The queen of rap🔥🔥🔥
how can people listen to this Dx
Ian know if was gonna be this good omg this might be my favorite song for now
Just my 2 cents. This ain't music. It's very sad to see the state of music at this moment. This might still be a commercial success because she is Benzino's daughter & has influential friends in the industry who will promote her. But that doesn't mean that this is anything but an attention grabbing stunt. It's not music made by a talented artist. This is the Tik Tok generation bringing music to its knees. Nicki Minaj is a talented artist but let's not act like she did this song for anything other than money (which most rappers do). But promoting rich kid, non talented wannabe artists like coi will keep deteriorating music further down the drain & Real artists suffer due to this.🤔
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
They could've kept this
this song is littt
Youtubr trying to ruin nicki. How only 100k exactly every hour on the hour 💀💀wat a coincidence. they know they wrong for that. Stop fu@#in with the views youtube. We see u

7 Flows in one Verse🔥🔥🔥🥁 The Queen
Who’s else need a joint right now! 🧐😑
Fuego🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is awful
First off. This is major for a new female artist like Coi Leray to be collaborating with the Queen of Hip Hop Nicki Minaj! Two Dope Artists I must say. I had a really great feeling that they would work together last year after hearing no more parties. Look. It came to pass. She reminded me of Dej Loaf. Shout out to Dej Loaf too. She’s ill. It amazes me that Onika is still in her prime after 14 years in the game! 2007 barbs where y’all at!!! Ayo shoutout to bringing Roman Zolanski back in the game for 2022. These bitches ain’t ready! Shoutout to all the core fans keep repping Nicki M. Nicki Lewinsky. Nicki the boss. Nicki write my own shit….Also come up dvd footage coming next week. Legendary! ❤️ This Blick Blick Is definitely a hit. Verse is giving 10 10 10 across the board. Billboard Top 10. Let’s go.
Here for the Queen of barbzzzzz........
This song is so catchy
💧💦🌊❤🔥👌
Let’s bring it to #1

I really don’t like the song but the video made it a bit better. But, of course Nick ATEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!
I'm not a Cardi B fan but should put her on the remix.
we're going for the number one position now
Bummer, didn't see Nicki in the headband bandeau. 🤣
I love how she embrace her herself and her body because she is absolutely beautiful the way she is - Don’t change your body body mama
Yessss
Not a fan of female rap(as in extreme) but I’m alr knowing this is gonna be the next big one….. well done
Wouldn't give a nickel for some chick Make you take anti depressents. Chick that make you lighter than air That chick Puerto Rican fair.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
speachless
Headband bandeau. 🤦‍♂️  FEMINISM! 👏👌
Hold up hold up hold up
So we all agree Nicki Minaj isnt really 39 right? She looking good asf

This shit go hard no lie. It’s officially in my everyday playlist. Nicki always eats 🔥🔥 COI though, baby you ATE even the looks was A1 yall definitely came through! That one part about fucked him & never gave that boy my number with the facial expressions was cute af
Queens🔥🔥🦄🦄
Nicki part is way better on beat and really singing 😘
I miss Eve, Lil Kim, Lauren Hill, Gangsta Boo, Mia X. I can’t take today’s female rappers serious. They all sound the same and rap about the same boring shit. Only one who is lyrical and can actually rap is Young Ma.She’s actually better than many male rappers of this generation lyrically.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Don't know why people keep saying coi is not a top one but now she's making music with barbie 🦄❤️✨period
💥💥💥
Nicki n coi really ate this shit up!!!!
I guess im sleep or sumthin cuz this is trashhhhhhh to me
They murdered this beat dammmmnnn
Idk this girl but I came here 4 Nicki and I’m glad Nicki was here, otherwise this song is a trash. Who tf wrote that girl’s verse? It’s repetitive and annoying and sounds like someone’s freestyle w/ no real content. She should’ve hired Nicki as the writer of her verse as well. Imagine repeating all those words and lines all throughout the song 🤦🏻
Viciado nessa música 🔥🔥🔥🦄🦄
🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
Can’t even Cap shit was 🔥🔥🔥
I love this llll lalalala
Fire asf 🔥 stop playing ‼️
Ate it left no crumbs love it !!!!!
nicki just get finer🏹🔥
Black 🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤 🤯🤯🤯🤯
I love the vid especially the slow motion on nicki
Omg nicki Minaj lost it
Yes❤💯
Honestly hoping Coi remains consistent after this.
POV: No Father Figure
Honestly this is Coi’s best work yet and I Stan Nikki for bringing the kind of energy that allows another woman’s confidence and courage to flourish in her atmosphere.  I know Coi gets a lot of body hate and Nik went through body dysmorphia early on in the game so seeing this piece of art is whole vibe 💕
wtf is this
Never imagine they would collab together. But they did 👏👏👏
Video cute afffff
I don’t know who Coi is but Nicki slays as always. This is a whole BOP
Não paro de ouvir 🦄🦄🔥🔥
Coi snapped🔥🔥🔥🔥stop playing with her gang 💪💯♥️🔥
Tuff🔥
So fire 🔥🔥
okay a bit too many male vibes !!!
DAMM 🔥🔥🔥
I ain’t even hearrrr Nicki Yet EAT IT UP BIG COI
The song is dope but the Bahama mama doing anything for a dolla don't sit right with me. So you calling us prostitutes ?

The first 20 sec my fav part 😂😂🔥🔥😍
She be wearing tf out them headbands around her chest. I WISH I could do that. my ideal body type is flatter chest and thicker on the bottom
Blick blick push it push it Clict clict I just wanna lick it (clict) Dont wanna hit it Put tha puzzy on a pedestal Like its all 3  metals  Spend some time up there ya know Scratches in back  She will fall in love My tongue dont slack Lay down arch back Blick Blick push it push it Clict clict lick it lick it I just want to lick it (clit) Dont gotta hit it Uh oh she about to explode Now its time for beast mode Puttin in tha work Now Shes about to squirt She screaming in tha air Ooh yeah right there Dont stop dont stop Lick it lick it I dont want tha blick blick  please please dont quit...

I love this song been on repeat sence it came out and the outfits I love the most they bring out personality you two are very creative people keep doing what you doing Coi and Nikki much love 💕👍🏾
Cula Cula WTF is this🤯🤯🙄
I think the song is 🔥 and nicki seems genuine with the young and upcoming artist however when you hear her say “ I’m the leader these b*tches follow ” and then she rubbing Coi Leray pink wig that identical to hers makes me think she just want somebody that she can have under her wing! I love Nicki but dislike her actions sometime!!
Ya'll weren't ready 🔥🔥
*Hey, to you reading* ... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
Guus 1.8M in 23 hours? Let's get to 2 M in 24 hours
definition of trash
Hey Nickie!
So this is the crowd Shenseea and Spice want to get into.
Woah!!!
We live in a era where you don’t have to have talent to make it not talking about Nicki though
Nice to see a different body type.
🚫🗑
Her animation and movement reminds me of how she was acting in 5 star remix music video!
The "Don't run up in my DM R.I.P to X too" line blew me! Paying homage to both DMX and XXXtentacion
nicki
Hey there! I am using WhatsApp.
The thing I like about Nicki being on features is how she takes the other artists verses and adds them to hers with a spin. She always knows how to maximize the other artist style. Man, it’s always something to hear!
They Finally Did A Music Video Together
Nicki lil dance 😭💓💓💓
nicki minaj is queen😍
2 million let's go!
yeah yeah
Nicki queen of rap!
I still can’t believe they sound so good TOGETHERRRR COI AND NICKKKKK OML😭😭
-  I just want to let anyone who’s reading this, and going through a tough time know that it’s going to be okay. You’ll get through it! ✨
My God, how special this work is, because Queen Nikki made the video an independent gem and an international trend, I love it 🤍🥺
Someone been taking notes from Kevin Gates vibes... Good song though Push it Push it
schrott
The gangster crap is gettin old already...nothing classy here!!
This shit is truly trash
It just dawned on me; what if she fucked these dogs or had the dogs lick her. Ugh!! I hope not. Outside of that  ur style is alright. U remind me of Aalyah and Ciara.
I said uhhhhh push push it click click!! Pop up on a opp and watch it Blick Blick 🔥🔥🔥 summer anthem u hear me!!!!!!!!!!

Proud Daughter And Sis😈

LOVE!
Fire fire fire fire
As a little body, seeing coi go toe to toe with nicki really boosts my confidence.  Even so, gotta keep it real with myself. I’m a bitch who could not compete because I do not compare. There are really levels to this shit…
Congratulations 🎉👏
This is so hard
Let's do 2M before 24 hrs
Best Rap song out Right Now
Omggg nicki es tan perfecta brillante y talentosa nadie la supera
Wow this song was terrible..I guess nicki  had her run. Can’t stay hot 4ever
This is Litt Litt 🔥 🔥 Nicki always doing the damn thing.
Both of them giving face card valid
WHY RELEASE MUSIC WHEN THERE IS A WAR HAPPENING BETWEEN RUSSIA AND UKRAINE + NATO.
I love you nicki queen
This is a boom
1:27 nicki's verse  cool leray ate tho im not a huge fan but i thought her verse was good
QUEEN OF RAP NICKI MINAJ
Am I out of touch or did 5 seconds of this give me actual brain cancer?
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🤍
This is a straight hit!!!! Nicki's boots and Coi's tutu made out of bandanas... the details 👏 Well done ladies xxx 💐 💐
https://youtube.com/channel/UCIOY77ntnySNPh9wOsiVo3g
No one Good like Nikki

Garbage
I feel like nicki changed her style just a little 🤏 over quarantine, but this feels like early quarantine/pre quarantine Nicki 😍
No we need them along with NBA YB & DA BABY ALL TOGETHER
GOOD SONG. BUT ITS PROMOTING GUN VIOLENCE.  LAST THING WE NEED IN PHILLY RIGHT NOW.
dog water
Love it❤️❤️❤️
Falla calla numba dolla okkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk

Solid radio banger.
Really nicki? THIS was supposed to be the best verse of 2022? Lmao girl no. U trippin Queen
🔥💯🔥💯
Coi mid. Nicky goat
Nicki please discontinue this after her…..
WTF? These are grown women right? Shameless...
Never doubt a Sagittarius 💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
I wish she was like an actual Coi (perhaps) fish so she could literally eat some food bc she looks like the female machinist. She falters I’m talking about Christian bale. Nicki always digs the uproot and that’s the savior. The way she just rides her shitty flow and little barely murder beat. How did her irrelevant dad fuck it up??? It’s wavy when Nicki maximizes the selection. No bags stopped here. I can’t watch anorexia nervosa on beat. Lisa get your girl interrupted.
Perfection ! Both artists killed it !
What the fuck was that!
this vid would be only 40 sec maybe if you took out every repeated word.
🔥
I’m calling it this is going to go viral.
Nicki smart. And this song is 🔥🔥
Queen looks AMAZING
The queen is queening
I was looking for a little more from out of her not saying it was bad it was ok as for nicki she did her thing not a song for me but it was ok
Queen 💗
Coi is SO Skinny😟

La muerte, es uno de los eventos más grandes que jamás tendrá lugar en tu vida.   Afrontamos la muerte todos los días, consciente o inconscientemente de ella; la muerte acecha en cada rincón de nuestra vida. Como un león esperando atrapar a su presa, la muerte nos llega a todos en muchas formas y formas; aparentemente no hay nadie que pueda escapar de las fauces de la muerte.   ¿Pero sabías que hay una razón por la que morimos? La idea de la muerte con la que está familiarizado es solo la punta del iceberg. Mira, morimos porque hemos pecado contra Dios. La muerte según la Biblia es paga "porque la paga del pecado es muerte" (Romanos 6:23).Debido a que el hombre pecó contra Dios, vivimos en un mundo caído, antes era perfecto, pero ahora está en ruinas. Ahora que el pecado existe, Dios viene a juzgar al mundo con justicia. Está establecido que un hombre muera una vez y después de este juicio "(Hebreos 9:27). El estándar por el que te juzgará son los 10 mandamientos, la ley moral de Dios.   Él es tan serio acerca del pecado que le dio a cualquiera que pecara la sentencia de muerte, la Biblia dice que te la has ganado pecando contra Dios y cada vez que pecas, acumula su ira. "El alma que pecare, esa morirá". (Ezequiel 18: 4) El castigo son los fuegos eternos del Infierno "Donde habrá llanto y crujir de dientes" (Mateo 13:42)   Tendrás que enfrentarte a Dios el Día del Juicio.   ¿Irás al cielo o al infierno?   Aquí hay una prueba rápida:   1-No tendrás otros dioses delante de mí. 2-No harás ídolos. 3-No tomarás el nombre del Señor tu Dios en vano, porque el Señor no dará por inocente al que tome su nombre en vano. 4-Recuerda el día de reposo. 5-Honra a tu padre y a tu madre. 6-No matarás. 7-No cometerás adulterio. 8-No robarás. 9-No mentirás. 10-No codiciarás.   ¿Alguna vez has dicho una mentira? robado algo? usó el nombre de Dios en vano? ¿Alguna vez has mirado a alguien con lujuria? Él ve la lujuria como adulterio, “Cualquiera que mira a una mujer con codicia, ya adulteró con ella en su corazón” (Mateo 5:28). ¿Alguna vez has odiado a alguien? él ve el odio como un asesinato, "Cualquiera que odie a otro hermano o hermana es un homicida" (1 Juan 3:15)   Santiago 2:10 dice, "la persona que guarda todas las leyes excepto una es tan culpable como una persona que ha quebrantado todas las leyes de Dios".   No confíe en su propia bondad o buenas obras para salvarlo. Eso es como sobornar a Dios para que te deje entrar al cielo; Ni una iglesia, pastor, sacerdote o religión alguna. Ninguno de nosotros es bueno en absoluto, incluso los asesinos, violadores, incluso Hilter se llamarán buenos y tratarán de justificarse por sus buenas obras. Pero la biblia dice:   • "Pero todos somos como cosa inmunda, y todas nuestras justicias son como trapos de inmundicia; nos marchitamos como una hoja, y nuestras iniquidades, como el viento nos llevaron". (Isaías 64: 6)   La definición de Dios del bien es moralmente excelente y, por lo tanto, exige perfecciones absolutas. Nadie puede igualar sus estándares. Por eso Jesús dijo: • "Nadie es bueno sino solo Dios". (Lucas 18:19)   Si ha hecho alguna de esas cosas, Dios lo ve como culpable de quebrantar su ley y la Biblia advierte que los culpables terminarán en el infierno. ¿Serás culpable el día del juicio final?   "Porque la paga del pecado es muerte, pero la dádiva de Dios es vida eterna en Cristo Jesús Señor nuestro". (Romanos 6:23)   Dios envió a su Hijo a sufrir y morir en la cruz. Jesús tomó el castigo sobre sí mismo y derrotó a la muerte en la cruz; no por tu Bien sino porque Dios es rico en misericordia.  "Porque tanto amó Dios al mundo que dio a su Hijo unigénito, el que en él cree no se pierda, sino que tenga vida eterna". (Juan 3:16)  Jesús resucitó de entre los muertos y venció a la muerte. Arrepiéntete (vuélvete del pecado) hoy y confía en Jesús y Dios te concederá vida eterna; también nacerás de nuevo.  Él te dará un corazón nuevo que desea la justicia, lo que es justo y un corazón que amará a Dios.  por eso Jesús dijo: "De cierto, de cierto os digo, que el que no nazca de nuevo, no puede ver el reino de Dios". (Juan 3: 3)  Luego, lea la Biblia y obedezca lo que lee.  ☆ ¿Cuándo vas a estar bien con Dios?  "Hoy, si escuchan su voz, no endurezcan su corazón como lo hicieron en la rebelión" (Hebreos 3:15) "Ahora es el tiempo aceptable, he aquí ahora el día de salvación". (2 Corintios 6: 2)   • "Tampoco hay salvación en ningún otro, porque no hay otro nombre bajo el cielo dado a los hombres en el que podamos ser salvos". (Hechos 4:12)   Es tu elección. Los dejo con esto: "¿De qué le aprovechará al hombre si gana el mundo entero y pierde su alma?" (Marcos 8:36).   Si te estás tomando esto en serio, ¿te gustaría una oración? Esta oración no es garantía de que serás salvo, eso es entre tú y Dios. Sin embargo, me gustaría que este fuera un buen comienzo para su viaje.  "Padre, te agradezco por el corazón abierto de esta persona y le pido que se arrepienta y confíe solo en Jesucristo. También te pido que guíes sus pasos en su camino para que pasen de la muerte a la vida. En el nombre de Jesús Amén.

THIS WAS SO FREAKING GOODDD
Death, it's one of the biggest events that will ever take place in your life. We face death everyday, conscious or unconsciously of it; death lurks around every corner of our life. Like a lion waiting to catch its prey, death comes for us all in many shapes and forms; seemingly there is no one who can escape from the jaws of death.  But did you know there is a reason why we die? The idea of death you're familiar with is only the tip of the iceberg. See we die because we've sinned against God. Death according to the bible is wages " for the wages of sin is death " (Romans 6:23).  Because man sinned against God, we live in a fallen world, it was once perfect, but now in ruins. Now that sin exists, God is coming to judge the world In righteousness. "It's appointed a man once to die and after this judgement" (Hebrews 9:27) The standard he'll judge you by is the 10 commandments, God's moral law.  He's so serious about sin that he gives anyone who sins the death sentence, the bible says you've earned it through sinning against God and God pays you in death. Each time you sin you build up his wrath. “The soul who sins shall die.” (Ezekiel 18:4) The punishment is the eternal fires of Hell " Where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth" (Matthew 13:42)  You will have to face God on Judgement Day.   Will you go to Heaven or Hell?  Here’s a quick test:   1.You shall have no other gods before Me. (Have you always loved God above all else?)   2.You shall not make yourself an idol. (Have you made a god in your mind that you're more comfortable with, a god to suit yourself?)   3.You shall not take God's name in vain. (Have you ever used God's holy Name as a cuss word?)   4.Remember the Sabbath Day, to keep it holy.   5.Honor your father and mother.   6. You shall not murder. (God considers hatred to be as murder, 1 John 3:15).   7. You shall not commit adultery. ("Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart" Matthew 5:27-28; this also includes sex before marriage).   8. You shall not steal. (Have you ever stolen anything? the value of the item is irrelevant).   9. You shall not lie. (Have you lied even once? Including answering these questions).   10. You shall not covet. (Have you ever jealousy desired what belongs to others?)   James 2:10 says, “the person who keeps all of the laws except one is as guilty as a person who has broken all of God’s laws.”    The Bible says that God will punish all murderers, rapists, thieves, liars, adulterers, etc. He will even judge our words and thoughts.   If you have done any of those things, God sees you as guilty of breaking His law and the Bible warns that the guilty will end up in Hell. Will YOU be guilty on Judgement Day?    "For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord." (Romans 6:23)   God sent His Son to suffer and die on the cross. Jesus took the punishment upon Himself and defeated death on the cross; not because you're Good but because God is rich in mercy.   “For God so loved the world that He gave His only Son, whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life.” (John 3:16)   Jesus rose from the dead and defeated death. Repent (turn from sin) today and trust in Jesus and God will grant you everlasting life.   Then, Read the Bible and obey what you read.   Pray something like this:   "Dear God, today I turn away from all of my sins (name them). Today I put my trust in Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior. He is the only way for me to be saved. He is 'The way, the truth, and the life.'" Please forgive me, change my heart, and grant me Your gift of everlasting life. In Jesus' name I pray. Amen."   When you find time please read this, it's Christian principles for growth:   https://www.livingwaters.com/save-yourself-some-pain/

"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life." -John 3:16(bible) "the wages of sin is death"-Bible. Therefore God the judge has given man the death sentence due to man's sin, but because of God's mercy, he gave himself(god incarnate/jesus)to die on a cross for the sins of the world. That means he paid our fine and if we trust in him God can legally let us go guilt free in court/judgment day and have everlasting life with Him!  "Go and sin no more!"-Jesus <3
All i see is 69 themes.......

What an amazing song very inspiring 👽👽
Who’s coi and who’s nicki
Gold in The Chests
So her dad wasn't lying
Fireeee
Coi, the best female artist out rn
them:”how many times did you watch this?” me:”y e s.”
Someone once said in a comment on a meme, that all these bitches ain't her sons and that they're lil kims 🤦🏾‍♂️. They're definitely Nick's sons, mind you, Coi's first 8 bars, she sound just like Nicki SMH lol, and since we're talking OGs, all these bitches use to be TRINA'S son's. Not lil Kim's.
Nicki should've had released this instead of bussin and "do we have a problem"
I was going to comment about Coi's body .... but you know what, in this day of  bubble butts and silicone breast, it is nice to see someone genuinely love their body.
Yessss!!!
This song is fire 🔥
Coi doesn't miss
😻😻😻
🤑
Okay I’m fckin wit this nicki snapped 💕
É a Queen né 👑💞
Whoever says this song’s trash is a hater. POINT BLANK PERIOD‼️‼️‼️‼️
I think I just watched a parody, this can’t be real.
I hope Coi ain't tryna sound like Meg or Cardi
we should get many more likes
Nickiiii man we love you mama!
Love Nicki and coi
FUN FACT: Coi Leray looks like a young trans or crossdresser
Okaaaaay Coi #CoiNikka 🦄💖

How can I like this video million times, cuzzzzzz mhennnnn

❤❤❤❤❤❤
Good
Nicki’s Pen is highly Phenomenal 🔥
The video is so fun, I love the IDGAFness that Coi brings to everything she does. True markings of a trend setter, she’s like no one out but as soon as she drops something the guys and gals are all rocking it, it’s because she dares to be different and has received so much hate but honestly that should tell you that she’s doing something right! Love them both.
As a skinny girl myself, i feel represented here. No body shame. Since female rap is dominated with thick curvy women. No hate. ✌

❤️🤍💙 🙏🇺🇦🙏🇷🇺 😑What is life, it is but a vapor, here today and gone tomorrow.  What will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses his own soul ? Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul, Jesus said. It’s appointed for man once to die then the judgement. Jesus came from heaven to earth to die on the cross and rise from the grave to forgive our sins. Jesus said to turn from sin and believe the Gospel for forgiveness !!! Only Jesus righteousness met the perfect standard of God. Because all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. All have lied and stolen and looked with lust. The wages of sin is ( eternal ) death but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. Goodness existed before I was born. All goodness IS GOD. We simply and humbly accept His goodness in and through us Christians. Self righteousness is pride !!! How can anyone do anything apart from the creator ???????  HOPE IN LOVE ❤️🙏🙂 Salvation is found in no one else, no other name under heaven given among men where by we must be saved.  Saved from the punishment of sin.  I’m trying to offer people Hope in absolute perfection !!!  No more pain, dying, lies, decay, depression, anxiety, crying, sickness, rotten food, broken things , etc...  offering the Hope of Eternity in heaven with Jesus Christ.  We must be willing to turn from sin and to believe the Gospel, Mark 1:15 to receive Jesus forgiveness.  He who does the will of God abides for eternity 1 John 2:17 Visual Bible movies on YouTube. Matthew, Acts, Luke, John    💜👑✝️📖nkjv 🧎‍♂️🙂 🙏🙂 When the Holy Spirit of Almighty God shows up, it’s not a coincidence, it’s your eternal choice, live for Jesus Christ ❤️📖nkjv 🧎‍♂️🙂🕊🕊🕊
Nicki 🥵🥵🥵🥵 👑

Started listening to Coi years ago. As soon as I heard her I knew she was gonna blow up, was just a matter of time. She is thriving despite all the haters and that is what real GOATS do. Bless up coi
They Served ‼️💯
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Nicki just don’t disappoint me EVER.
Yoh this collabo is one for the books🤞🏾. Defs one we have never imagined we needed 👌🏾🔥🤞🏾
🥂💝
Yo necesitaba está colaboración urgente!!! 😍🔥
Nicki still looking good I’m just saying but I say it
Slayyyyy!!!
Not that Nicki got Her Rapper sonz Singing 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 I cought that Shade Nicki
Nicki Minaj's whole barbie persona is still lit after more than a decade!!!😍 Damn she really is Number 1. She is the empire. We're just the peasant looking up 😘😘😘 she is just amazing. I do give respect to rappers before her, MC, Missy Elliot, Kim, Trina but they never did what Nicki has done and that is fact. You really need a rap Mogul to last a long time and be fully successful for years to come. They will never be another rapper like her abd if there is I guess we'll be long gone.  She is definitely up there next to Dr Dre, jay z. She gives me chills. It's like living in the era of Tupac. I'm grateful to be alive at the same time as she is
Buy, stream on ALL platforms, and request radio play! Let's set them charts on fire!!! 🔥🔥🔥

Well that was terrible
Peeps. Please realize companies are spending billions of dollars to pump out top comments on Youtube. This is easily done by paying top influencers and then then paying money for likes and comments. The people who are at the top of these comments are likely getting paid.
That's right Nick turn leray up,she worked hard and deserves it
She sound like Doja or Doja sound like her.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Kane grocerys
I thought it was gonna be better but it didn’t give 😕
This is FIRE. As the queen once said “I ain't tryna be violent, but if Nicki on it, it slaps, hoe”. Period.
Nicki blends so well in all hits . This is what an artist should be capable of doing . Not one sounding off from the other one
😒
So your saying coi lerray can get the Nikki Co-sign but Tyler the creator can’t???
This is bad bad. Not good at all
coi leary stands like a little kid back bent and stomach out idk why it’s been bothering me for ages
And there it is folks
Got this on repeat 💯❣️
BTW this song promotes sexisim
Yessssss this song lyrics and  video y’all did that
Alright Nicki looking like mother..  She sonning these hoes..

Never heard of  Coi LeRay....RHYMES GOOD.....ENERGY ON ANOTHER LEVEL!!
Amazing 🤩
Nicki really the GOAT 😭🐐
Run the views wtf
Forever pop💫🕊
Ya'll surprised because I'm shook nicki verse mad sick baaaaad
Idk what it is about Coi Leray but she is bad as fuuuuuuuck 🤤 🤤 🥰 🥰 ❤️
💥💥💥💥💥💥💥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
No hurt feeling to Coi but this is Nicki's song now.
This is a perfect duo
Go crazy 😝
Hmm 😨😨😨
I love that Coi is so confident in her natural slim body. It’s refreshing. You can see she knows how sexy she is. You can’t tell her nothing. Yasss throw Them cupcakes 🧁 boo I’m here for it 😍
🔥
Dammmmmnn Nicki murdered her on her own song lol
🥵🥵🔥🔥
Okay 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
They both so fine
aaAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Nicki hair is so yes. It’s just yes. There’s nothing else to say
Garbage 🗑
The Dior Fit …. Yes ma’am!!!!
Let’s gooooo
So PROUD of Coi!! This is 🔥🔥🔥🔥and y’all already know “HOES Ain’t Fuckin wit BARBIE!” Nicki never misses
Nicki still signing off on hoes i see… I’m not at all a fan but she dropped the bar wit this one!! It was OK but she has done wayyyyyyyy better than this shit
Why Nicki wasted her time with this trash is beyond me. It's obvious just from watching the Freshman Cyphers that Coi doesn't write any of the shit she puts out and that wack performance made her lose all credibility, not that she had any to begin with. Literally clicked on this because of Nicki and I'm sure that's the only reason it'll get views. Ugh.
Starting my morning with this track💟💟, amazing 🇿🇦
Nicki always turning me on to artists. I normally jus rewind Nicki part over but I'm actually rewinding the whole song cuz coi snapped too.. #Queen #Nicoi

And to know that because of her big mouth daddy we almost did hear this. Dang!
I actually like it.
Tf Kane grocerys doing in there
My Queen Nikki, that little girl with you excites me 🔥❤💋😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
yes
OKAY NICKIIII
I’m not surprised this sounded as fire as it did! Coi not only has bars, but talent. I’ve not seen anything she’s done that doesn’t have her own originality on it! NICKI, NICKI, NICKI—OMG!!! Why did she have to come snatch my plate and eat everything off it—leaving no crumbs! Show me a female rapper out here who is fucking with the QUEEN’S pen!! Then show me another with her delivery! Then point out another with her flow and ability to mix up her cadences! I would wait but shit I have things to do, it’s gonna be a while! Visuals and styles was mad dope, Coi’s “belt -bra” Dior situation was so cold it was kinda sickening.
What a good unique fresh sound, not like cardi b and megs nonsense repetitive sound
😎💯
🔥🔥🔥🔥💕💕💕💕💕💕
This collab needed to happen.  🔥🔥 Coi and Nicki did there thing
Did Nicki change her flow 8 times or am I tripping?
love nicki and her verse but was it just me or did she look kinda lost in the video
Blick blick
นิคปัง
เยี่ยวแตก
สวย
ปัง
Very disappointed
They both SKATEDDDD ⛸⛸⛸
10/10
This is the worst song I’ve ever heard
The song's lit 🔥 and they both ✨served✨  But why is Nicki holding the gun like that tho? 😭
Finally a video that not extra dark & demented. Love it❤️
Wtf this bih doing 😕?
I love Coi she’s literally so cute to me lol
THE ICONIC "AY YO" BEFORE NICKI STARTS SPITTING BARS 👑👑
Yessss coi she ate on this track! Nicki never disappoints of course 🔥🔥🔥🔥 loving the visual aswell coi is beautiful don’t play with her!
Cute ng suso ni Coi
This her best song !!!
What does blick blick mean?
Love her body 🥰🥰  Her swag so different too 😎
who else loves when it pops upp New Subscriber or someone liked your comment. it just makes my day
Love How Nicki and Coi came through for the "22!!!!💯💯💯😎😎😎😎
Nicki saved this track
She ate ❤️😭
I like Coi switched her flow up, and of course the Queen killed shit 🔥🔥
MEE ONIKA TANYAAAA 😜😜
Nicki always serving like 😳
Wack...We have all officially became dumbed down. Remember when music involved talents n voices. So much for that. And Minaj just needs to change up at this point. Shes aging. Sex always sells tho. (shaking head)
Summer Bop #BlickBlick
Yessssss #BlickBlick
#BlickBlick #CoiNicki
No other girl collab is better than this 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
So hard
🔥
Dis hit
Best song out
Run the VIEWS
Coi gone get her RESPECT!

Hardest duo 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I love this song.

🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣……………🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
HEYYYYY QUEEN OF RAP NICKI MINAJ
I like it but tired of vagina songs already
I wonder what Jeff Bezos texting Nicki about? Lol
I love the song
As a guy who have zero interest in female hair.. that blonde crop over the long black hair is mesmerizing for some reason
You can tell Nicki is a mom now , her verse is hard af but she ain’t talking about the regular sexual stuff now , she’s just spitting bars like the old Nicki
Mehh
Y’all did the damn thing on this one 😍
I freaking love this song it’s a bop🔥
I love how Nicki mentioned x
QUEEN LOVE YOU
Nicki ain’t have to go hard like this💓🔥🔥💓🤦🏽‍♀️
Nicki is so damn fine like omg 😳 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥👑
🔥🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I don’t like the song. I think both are talented but it’s a flop👎🏽
Wonder what she be texting Jeff bezos about ?!!???!!!! 👀👀
I like it 🤠
Coiiiii is ah reallllll vibeeeeee 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
COI LERAY LOOKS LIKE A LIL BOY NEXT TO NICKI 😂😂😂 DAFUQ. She’s so boring damn. Swear Nicki came on the beat just to remind us why she still the main black female rapper
https://youtu.be/3feVzlwkM7Y

Good job coi your getting better I like the new cadence that was hard
More brainless music for sheep, like me, to consume; like prechewed grass! 🧡 I love to vegetate my brain to this beat! 🧡💀🧡
I said HUH
Coi Leray is trash. Please stop signing back artists like this. No amount of marketing is going to make her talented. Waste of a good Nicki verse.
Onde estão as mulheres gostosas e bonitas como as dos clipes do 50 cent, Nelly?
Nicki brushing coi’s pink wig at the end just made my younger nick stan self so proud and so happy 🥺💕💕
🔥✨
1M in 8 hours
Nicky🇨🇩
This ate😂
One thing about Coi... she gon rap and dance her ass off... this is a whole bop...Nicki is literally aging backwards and flowing forward! 🙌🏽
This is a distraction
It's all about being real with yourself knowing you got that crown in your heart just need that extra push to get your hands on it.  Everyone have a blessed night @nd if you beautiful woman tnah needs a real man I don't be in ppl business lkke tjah but I know pressa don't play no shit he as solid as the core of the earth
The way Nicki murdered this track 😩😭
Garbage
I've watched this way too many times 😭 I know every word now 😂 Nicki's verse tho 🔥🔥🔥🔥 I love it 😍
😙

Hudson Institute, a think tank in Washington, D.C., held an online forum on October 18 titled “China’s War on Religion.” Given the severe persecution of Uyghurs, Muslims, Christians, practitioners of Falun Dafa (also known as Falun Gong), and Tibetan Buddhists by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), the forum set out to discuss how the U.S. and other democratic countries can help promote greater religious freedom and human rights in China.  Moderated by Nina Shea, Senior Fellow and Director, Center for Religious Freedom at Hudson Institute, the panel also included Xiaoxu Sean Lin (spokesperson for the Falun Dafa Association in Washington D.C.), Robert A. Destro (Professor of Law at Catholic University of America and former Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor), and Nury Turkel (Senior Fellow, Hudson Institute).   Speakers participate in the Hudson Institute’s online forum titled “China’s War on Religion” on October 18, 2021.  Shea specifically invited Lin to talk about the CCP’s forced organ harvesting from living Falun Gong practitioners in China. The atrocities have expanded beyond Falun Gong practitioners to other minority groups.

BARBİEE
I literally watched this shit a million times. so pleasant to my ears and my eyes lol
She always comes back with fresh flow. That right there is the verse of the year by the queen of rap herself. Nicki's verse is so full of eargasms. The rapid switch in the flow, playfulness. This is what I missed about Nicki. Normally Nicki completely steals the song but gotta admit Coi defended her lead very well but can't defeat Nicki.
THEY KILLED THAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!🔥🔥🔥
Nicki>>>>>>
Queen of rap nicki
Love you nicki
Queen nicki
Coi has been unapologetically her since DAY ONE, and it paid off 🥳   She got her one fr, and onika blessed her with some barssss 🦄🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 I've listened at least 10x already

Banger
Nicki yine kurtarmış 👍🏻🔥
OH ma GOD ONIKA 😍😍
💘🔥
A MAIORR NICKI MINAJ 🗣️🗣️😍😍😍
I’m in LOVE with this song!!! One thing I notice that I just didn’t realize…Nicki really is small in weight & height. She really IS the perfect looking woman!!! No wonder why they hate on her so much. Men and women are VERY threatened by a gorgeous strong Black woman! 💯
🔥🔥🔥🔥
I’m Harlie thats my part (my daughter name) and drake said I look like Hamzah (my son name)
It's good
love this look
Trash 🗑
🔥🔥🔥🎉

Periodtttt
They sounds good together 😍❤️🦄
22grammies🥰🥰
cant sleep on coi no more PERIOD
Grammiess🤞🏾🤞🏾🤞🏾🎉🎉👿💪🏾💪🏾🤞🏾🤞🏾🤞🏾
It’s a cute song. I see a bunch of Tik tok challenges happening with the vibe. It’s nice to hear more of Nicki again. I look forward to her next era 🔥🔥  No shade, no tea… I just want her to get rid of those auntie arms… and ya know I’m not lying 😩
I don't want to believe I am the only one who got the bar about DM, DMX and XXX. Triple entendre? Nah Nicki goated for this.
The whole tri-state area need to be standing up for this rn.
Fireeee

The fact that nicki has been rapping for over a decade and still hasn’t ran out of bars with the ability to switch 3-4 flows in one verse is proof that she is top tier next to the greats don’t ever play with her 😮‍💨

I don't see what the hype is about these girls are repeadly saying the same exact shit  over and over and over and over again if it wasn't for Nicki's verse this song would definitely be garbage and when I say garbage I mean damn all the females rap about exactly the same shit constantly and they all are starting to sound alike geesh where's the shift changer at in these artist female artist smh hip hop soon be dead
500 000🔓
So, Nicki didn't want to Collab with Doja but collabs with Coi Leray this song isn't even good tbh doesn't even fit Nicki well and the video wasn't that good either there were sometimes where Nicki's voice over wasn't moving with her mouth.
Coi is making moves🔥🔥
So proud🔥🔥🔥🔥👏👏👏👏
🔥🔥🔥🙌🏾😤
I can't lie, it feels nice to see Barbie Nicki again 😭😭🔥🔥🔥what?
Honestly here for my  queen nicki 😭😔❤

I like both their flows on the track & they look good! 💕 something about Nicki’s  face/makeup is reminding me of Megan tho 👀
Dam  🔥🔥🔥
They need to quit playing with Coi like she didn’t eat the begging of this of song bar by bar and her delivery was Good. She did great it was just the stuttering that threw it it off
Coi be shaking that lil shit👅😂.
This music is so stupid.  What happened to music...😞

Ion like the song, but Nicki's verse was 🔥
Nicky
🔥🔥🔥
Didn't know Coi, but this was her bet decision! She and Nicki's flows matched and she did really good. I like how Nicki give her partner shine yet she out shines them without trying too! lol
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Is it just me or am I the only person that’s glad to see Coi Leray doesn’t have a botched body.
😍😍😍
Y’all should’ve known once Nicki defending her dead performance, she was gonna work with her and get her more recognition. It was all strategically planned thereafter, lol.
What happened to music? This song is TRASH!
Coi's style is giving aaliyah vibes
Is she Asian talking about niggas?
The Queen and Lil Purr did not disappoint honey 💕💕🪄 This flow so nice 🔥🔥🔥

🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💖💖💖💖💖 Y’all know what to do #Barbz RUN IT UP!!!!!
Franchement j’adore le clip , la vibe Nicki ,coi . Le fait qu’elle soit sans complexe et twerk comme ça franchement chapeau .  je valide totalement
How does Nicki somehow sound better after all she’s been through lately? Nicki is one of those rare breeds of talented artists that can continue to improve on her near perfect sound far later in her career than most. As well as an uncanny ability to stay relevant. I’m a rapper and producer in the underground scene and Nicki’s music had a pretty profound impact on my passion for hip-hop. I will always be grateful that I grew up listening to her music on the radio. She is the most empowering female in rap. Great video too!
Coi X Nicki  fire🔥🔥🔥
21:33 v 18/3

🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥👌🏽
Playboi Carti going hard
As much hate she gets for working with new artists “for clout”, I find it very iconic that she’s doing something a lot of the OG rap girls didn’t do. & that’s work together. When Nicki came out one of the og rap girls (Lady Luck) admitted they all hated Nicki. (Not all ofc). But not many worked with her no matter how many times she payed homage or showed love publicly. Not even the unproblematic queen Lauryn Hill has yet to work with Nicki. & that’s ok! But this shows a true one and only, true queen of rap. Thee queen of rap & has to be crowned to Nicki 👸🏽🦄. 15/16 years in the game and still going hard. There’s gonna be no other like her.
Nic fixing Coi's wig at the end 🥺😍
oh my god give coi leray a little more body 🙏🙏🙏 i am praying....
The looks that Coi Leray serves in her videos get progressively better😍 she’s a beauty! Even if Coi Leray is cute and has a cute voice, she can bring the bars and do damage on a record 😈 I’m happy for you Coi, having Nicki on this was an excellent choice. Nicki’s metaphors and punchlines never miss she’s the QUEEN! and Nicki always looking too good 🥵 Snatched to the gods!  💝🔫👑👑 Blick Blick!
Coi Leray really ate
Ummm okay but coi Leray really killing it with the vibes and omg she looks good asssf she in her own lane !  Love her gangsta side!

Coi came thru! Secured the Queen of rap Co sign and delivered a slay of a video! Gorl you did that. Watch everybody start hating! Keeping writing those raps! Not a lot of girls can say they write their raps!
Unt uh who edited this video I see a few mess ups
❤
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Definitely a no from me but these days if you don't sound alike then you won't make it. So I guess it suits this generation.
I know my fave Nicki always deliver♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Love love love seeing a female rapper without a BBL.  No shade to all the girls with one but it's just soo refreshing.
"Run up in my DM, rip to X too" Brilliant! RIP DMX AND XXX

Yes yes yes yes yes Nicki Minaj queeeeennnnnnnnnnnnn
Great song by the Queen AGAIN. If you think this song is good, you haven't seen my music yet!! 🔥🔥
BRO ?? NICKI FUCKING ATE ! 💕💕💕
I like that Coi kept her body natural. All these other female rappers tryna look like Nicki, but she stayed true to her. Respect!
the way I’m jus realizing Wayne and Kenny was in the video.
Who styled this
Straight 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Coi price just went up!!
Love this collab with Nicki 🔥🔥🔥
I should’ve saw this collab coming whn nicki told her keep her head up last year 🥰🙏🏽
Thank Aaliyah for the skinny girl baggy pants, crop top look
nicki and coil’s lil choreo!!
I AM SHAKING THEY LOOK SO GOOD OMG
Not a bad song I’m surprised ❤️❤️
Where's ma Niiiickiiiii At ?! 🥰🥰🥰😍😍😍 Barb's where are ya !!!!
Leggo Coi x Nicki #blickblick 😍🥵💃🏼❤🔥
Nah this is a HIT RECORD!!!!!! Periodddddtttt 🔥🔥
it’s a really good music video
New TikTok trend on the way with this sound.
1:07 Niki entered and took my breath away… she looks GOOD
🤪🤪
2:57 OMG THE QUEEN AND HER DAUGHTER IS HERE
I love the song and the video was coo Coi and Nicki did their thing 💯💯
Ahhhhhhhhhhh 😍😍😍
It’s the same song over and over again! They’re talking about nothing. Draco’s and booty shaking. There’s no variety today. All female rappers are stripper rappers talking about the same thing. Where’s the Lyte’s, Latifah’s, Yo Yo’s and Monie Love’s?
🔥🔥🔥❤❤❤

Like the song.. like CL music..(wish I never saw the freshman cypher tho).. love that she has her own style and is "setting trends" BUT, she needs to dress for her body type.. her torso is exxxxreeemely long...those bandos, and bra tops and sagged jeans are accentuating it and not doing her any favors.. females need to dress for their own body type not for what is in style!!
I AM SCREAMIIIIIING!!!!
UHHHHHHHHHH

If you wanna hear from God? read this. This is for the people who don’t understand God, nor know God… or for people struggling trying to find some sort of meaning in their lives. I want you to know and understand that Jesus Christ is the meaning! it’s all about believing in him, trusting in him, and not on anything else. There is no other God besides Jesus Christ… the rest are just idols / false gods made by Satan himself to deceive mankind. Just so you know, no other “god” died for you and for the rest of mankind for your sins, just our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ… he died for us. He had to die to set us free from the sin that was committed by Adam and Eve in the beginning of creation all those years ago at the Garden of Eden. By them having been seduced by the serpent who is also called “Satan” something dark happened in the spirit world where by them deliberately sinning against God by eating the fruit in which God forbade not to eat lest ye die, they did eat and died in the spirit, and by that the devil had authority over all souls because of that sin, sin entered into the body like a poison infecting the spirit and that is why there is so much evil in the world today and always has been, because of sin. God in the beginning made everything perfect, but he gave man free choice and by that free choice Adam and Eve chose to believe Satan and his lies and fell into the trap. Years later came the prophets who came to point to the arrival of our Messiah Jesus Christ and then there came Jesus, our Lord and Savior, the begotten Son of God who wrapped himself in flesh like all of us, the only being to have walked on earth and never sinned, died, sacrificed himself being perfect with a mission to save all mankind from eternal hellfire for all souls who deserved it. but God, being a loving and merciful God loved us so much that he sent down Jesus his only begotten Son to be the perfect sacrifice for the remission of all sins, past, present and future sins, beat the devil, and took the keys to the pit conquering hell, death in the grave rose again and was resurrected at the 3rd day and by that loving action from God himself, we are now set free by trusting and believing in Jesus and what he did for us on that cross. Jesus gave us a free gift of eternal life in the spirit by believing in his name, believing he is God and believing that he died for us and rose again on the 3rd day and that by his precious blood that He shed on that cross for the remission of sins our lives are set free by faith in him and what he did… that’s it. trust him as your Lord and Savior and you will receive the Holy Spirit that comes from God and you will be saved in the spirit when you die in the physical realm here on earth. The only reason why there are so many agnostics and atheists in this world today is because of the fact that the devil has been covering up the evidence since the beginning and all things that prove the existence of God and also making life impossible for people who do not know or believe in God by them asking themselves “why would a loving and just God allow this in my life?” but it isn’t God, it’s the devil, because the spirit of the devil roams around on earth at all times seeking someone to devour because his only goal is for that soul never to know God to drag him to hell with him for all eternity. Another fact, the devil isn’t the ruler of hell, he isn’t there… but in the end of prophecy he will be thrown there for all eternity in suffering, he’s currently roaming the earth causing havoc to steal, kill, and destroy. The sad matter of the fact is that if you do not put your faith in Jesus, you will perish sadly, because a lot of sin is still in you and you didn’t come to the Lord to wash you whole and complete… so, trust Jesus, trust God, and you will be saved. He loves you so much and he wishes that none should perish but that all come to repentance so… read your bible if you have more questions, all answers are on there. God bless you!

Bbc😝😝😝😝😝too fire yow🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ate
This is Everything 🇯🇲❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 the collaboration we didn’t know me needed.
Yall are GORGEOUUUSSSSS
Too fucking dope 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I know ain’t her redid but Ain’t Nicki tired of making the same videos since 2009??!!! Imagine being months from your 40th birthday and making records and videos like this. Nicki “the self-proclaimed queen” Miraj at this point and time in her career should be in her Kendrick and J Cole bag right now. But I see a trend that musically no ageing female musicians no longer wants  to be aligned with their age nowadays. From Madonna to JLO etc. the pressure to stay relevant to a younger audience is now obvious with Nicki..
Rrrrrr love it 😍😍😍❤❤❤🔥🔥🔥
Loved the PR bar🇵🇷🔥
This is 🥰🥰😍
Nicki looks so damn good!! Sheesh!!
another day, another slay. PERIODDDDD
I actually really love both of them , this was 🔥
Why are the likes more than the views????

Aight so here’s the deal Nicki’s verse slap but all the new shit she been releasing feels like it’s missing something, to be completely honest Nicki been whack lately and it’s sad to witness the downfall of a queen, she really need to step it up fr or retire there ain’t no other choice.

Fuuuuuuuucccckkk!!!!!!!!!! This shit Faa🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥aaaya!!!! Was expecting some Glocks and Dracos in the video though.... But this shit hit hard I don't mind no more..
I'm not sure how I feel about the song maybe it will grow on me. I didn't care for the video. It's such a big career move for Coi and I feel like the video didn't match how big of a deal this moment is for her  Edit: I know it's hard to pack visuals and entertainment in under 3min...I couldn't do it.
#BlickBlick #CoiNicki #

The fact that Nicki said RIP to Xxxtentacion is so meaningful. He died so so young and didn’t deserve that. I miss his words of advice and wish he was still here to make more music.

Nicki verse is so good, but is the only thing I can save from this song to be honest.  however the video is great, nicki looks phenomenal and I love that she's trying to perform more than she's been doing lately, it reminds me to her old videos something that I really appreciate.

I Think This Is Coi Leray's best song yet not even because nicki is on the song  which makes the song better which is why coi leray is the trendsetter and nicki is the queen of rap
Can’t believe Nicki’s almost 40 and is looking younger than most of the rap girls and she never touched her face
Omg Nicki Minaj Queen Of Rap 👑🔥

It’s giving!!!
If a musician does not have a full-time job and they’re fully dedicated to their craft and this is what they have to deliver I am very disappointed.  I think this is lazy you barely coi was rappin for one minute and you want the praise for that? I’m not sure why female rappers don’t prove they got pen skills vs just twerking.
Yall they ate
I would've never thought they go so well together but they do! It's fire!
QUEENS💋🔥
Congrats Coi. as usual flawless verse from Queen Nicki..🔥🔥🔥

This Collab Was Unexpected Even When It Was Announced And This Is Really Good Coi Verse Was Fire And The Queen Never Dissappoints🥰🥰🥰
I've listened to this entirely too many times. This the one
I'm so ready for this curveball in Coi's career, she's been humiliated and dismissed for too long for her 'lack of talent' but this has proved otherwise. She's DIFFERENT which not every rapper could say!!
Goes hard 💪🏾✨
watch waistline Coi!
HONESTLY the song is fucking good I mean denying it literally would be lying to yourself.
the collab we never expected
❤️❤️❤️
One thing about Coi shes going to make sure shes twerking somewhere . Congrats

#blickblick 🔫🔫
Nicki Minaj is not the best female rapper , she is the best rapper in general , people forget that nicki went on tracks with men and smoked them on their own song...this is a fun song but she still delivered different flows , bars and she always been animated so nobody should complain about that  Nicki has always been like this , give this woman her flowers, there is no other Nicki Minaj and will never be.💯
wow queens
Incredible alroun 🔥🔥🔥
I’m in tears... this is beautiful... I am so happy ... this is amazing ... 😭😭❤️❤️❤️
Nicki Minaj ate her verse up
I’m happy for Coi. She’s a great representation for black girls when it comes to accepting her body. The black community act like no other body types exist , and this girl works so hard and I love that she still wears her outfits and do her lil dance.  Nicki ate as always!!! Definitely never thought they would work together.

People at this point just like to down shame any celebrity or upcoming rappers when new songs come out it’s been a thing now, and honestly it’s becoming overwhelming and really overrated. So,like if someone is bringing something new to the game, stop trying bash them as soon as they start promoting like people lame for it and it be the people of the same race, like especially our black community. Don’t hate if you not shining as bad as the person you bashing 💯FACTSSSS!
Rainha do rap 🇧🇷
This is gonna be 🔥
Can't wait
Ommmmmmmmmg 😤‼️

NICKIII
I can't wait
Coi Leray has come a long way from G.A.N to now she is talented she is blessed to have a song with Nicki. I’m so happy for Coi 👏👏👏👏 and from listening to her music for the last few years she's definitely made some good progress she's on point. And I can tell that she's been through a lot from these last few months, & the fact that she's still standing on her own two feet in a world that has tried its best to knock her down over and over again, proves only the truth; that she is unbreakable. 🙏🙌👏💕💕💕🦋
Coi Leray bout to be a household name with this one
My sister be blast both of their music in her car.
