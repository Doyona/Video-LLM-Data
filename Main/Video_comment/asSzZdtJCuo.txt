Purple literally snitched in Cyan
Purple

I like when he says it’s him and red dies 💀💀💀💀💀
Blue is like Judah
5:59 ultimate crashout LOL
The fact cyan never came back was sad
Purple saying "Sometimes the best victory is the one you don't have to fight for" was way too real 🗿
Okay, but seriously. The tv is made by ASUS. That's a peak easter egg right there.
5:58 "and your f**ing medbBbbBBbAa-" nah man I’m dead💀😂
nice
2025 anybody?😊
1:12 kung fu panda/kung fu blue
5:51 Crashout of the decade
9:17  Whoulda been the craziest plot twist if it showed.  Purple was not The Imposter And blue was actually The Imposter but didn’t know
the fact that blue always votes red or himself and then at the end he votes the imposter
Purple: *holding gunpoint at someone*   Everyone: this is finee
He was holding the gun in front of you all
Next time please do reds sus
Purple the imposter not purple the crumpet
Does green relise that he has a note on him that says dum
Blue is pure moron
Why isn’t the dum sticky note not on blue
0:46 WAIT… A PURPLE BRITISH PERSON??? WILLIAM?!?
Anybody still here in 2024 I used to love watching this so much as a kid and I still do
It’s obviously purple are you guys dum
Purple is definitely a COD reference
Dark blue is my favorite
Am I the only one noticed the "I like ya cut g" Thing from Purple then the taco bell thing.
I love blue he is so funny
Anyone from 2024??? ✋
Blue saved us again
Who is more funny? White vs red and blue
Purple it's impostor.
Honestly cyan should’ve lasted longer but still would’ve been voted out…
Hes British I don’t think we should trust him
Bro how did purple kill green everyone else ill ignore that
Why green always die at the beginning?
nice vid
Black is always wires
8:20 “your stupid” got me
I love blue
I think it’s red
1:04 Everyone: hears there’s two imposters  Blue: it’s fine, I’ll beat ‘em up
Quality video
British guy sounds like Fuse from Apex Legends
Can you make Purple sing a song to us Please
Poor green he’s always dying
Atleast green's alive this time
Blue always saves the day at the end lol
Where is brown???
Why did purple bicame Billy Butcher?
Did anyone noticed that Green's body was behind the crew during the 2nd meeting.😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Purple is a favourite
Blue is an idiot  (Red doing tasks with blue and blue turns back) (Purple vents) (Purple kills Red) (Blue reports the body) Blue:I accidentally killed Red. Red’s Ghost:ITS PURPLE!!! Blue:I think it’s me.
British purple guy not to be trusted? Murdering people secretly? Awfully familiar...
Purple is the imposter I know cause I am smart
How are they Mad At 2 imposter’s There isn’t 4 or 5
Purple sounds like that dude from that one game. I don't remember what the name of the game was.
Purple is hacker 💀
Puuuuuuuuuuuupple
5:52
as soon as i saw him, i knew it was red
1:03 is ghost!
“The prices have landed, the pawns are in place… time for checkmate.” Best quote ever
Red  f you fyou and fyou hzhhsshhsshhshs7sususzoaoskks0aoaoqaow9woaaoaaoaoqoqoa
"But sometimes the best place to hide is in plain sight." -Purple
I can't believe this is three years old
Black dash like Naruto 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Blue breakdown count:2
Black death count:2
Again everything starts with black making his task
Purple: the space man behind the slaughters.
black with the wires allways
Why does blue always get the final vote to win and green is always the first to die
0:48 that is racist
Idk red kind of seems sus
LMAO I just realised purples voice cracked at 2:36
Bro what a liar eater everybody saw purple Killed green
5:55
Blue is always the hero of the video.
Purple is a such a Great Detective.
I still think it was stupid for purple to green in front of everyone
Does anyone know the song at the beginning?
Among Us part 6 would be appreciated
Bro blue makes me laugh I think it’s me😂😂😂
"He's British? I don't think we should trust him.."   Me: *Laughing insanely hard*
I like your cut g lol
i quote some of the things they say while playing among us 😭
Blue the hole time is just so funny
*4:37* why does that seem like something my Scottish grandmother would do
havent watched this in 2 years, forgot how awesome all of this was
This among us series reminds me of Red versus Blue
I don't buy it still sus  Hahahaha
HOLY CRAP PURPLE IS CAPTAIN PRICE
The way blue always clutches lool
there all stupid purple should get voted out in the first 4 mins
I love blue and red relationship.
2:36 THAT VOICE CRACK 😂
Purple sounds like a death message from a video game when they say “ don’t worry, we’ll get em next time”
5:59 MED BELERLERLER XD
bruh
your the imp!
Blue is so funny he almost just says eh
5:51 is the most hilarious part lmao 💀💀
6:40 😂 this was funny 😂
"I like you you cut g."  "Wait what."  "Taco bell bell*
Purple had the gun
5:51 "FINE." "  *I GET IT. MEGORITY RULE RIGHT!?*  WELL FU_K YOU.. FU_K YOU. *AND FU_K YOU  AND WITH  YOUR FU_KING MÈÐƁÆŸÀŸÂŸÆÀŸÀŸAŸAŸAYA-*
Omg I love blue he’s the best and he’s argues with red
2:33 purple literally holds a gun at white in front of a meeting and people still trust him!?
You guys should do another vid on among us but with roles
nah blue is acting like he doesnt even know how to play amogus bruh
Oh my God the full for the very first time blue acting something like SWAT Alexa mungo's video that you do make a really dumb character let's make a really dumb dumb
I love your videos
Is blue good he sound like a drunk mumbling man
bro purple just holy a f.king gun envronof everone shut the f.k
Well done great work 😂😂
4:18 Fitting.
9:09 The hypocrisy coming from purple is honestly hilarious.
Purple is sus because he pulled out a gun and pointed at white saying he wasn't the impostor.
LMAO! 5:52 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
blue is pro
The Blue xDDDDDDDDD thanks guys u made this amazing piece of art.
5:59 my favorite part idk why
hi 2020 people
Is that a real gun? 🔫
2:00 that a stack kill, when if there is a crewmate group that has at least 1 impostor there will be 99.99% of people killed and since the players are blocking each other's view no one knows who the culprit is
Purple saying don't worry we'll get him next time Gave me such MW2 vibes lmao
They are so stupid they can't see purple has a gun
3:35
Pick
Gr no sé
blue still looks like Rag Reynolds
Purple really said I like ya cut G before killing 😂😂😂
This literally makes me want to play Among Us again. And I haven’t played it since early 2022 😂
Amoung us public lobbies be like
I thought that one said he was British?
6:43 is the best lol
I still love these skits. 💀
SUS 6:59
*Orange black and purple vote white* White: FINE! I get it majority rule right 5:55 Well f*ck you f*ck you f*ck you AND YOUR F*CKING- (has a seizure) Also white: *gets voted of the ship*
Stupid blue
2:33 how did they not notice that he’s holding a gun?
Lmao
Price in AMONGUS
Two Impostors, 7 Pepole, 5 Crewmates.
The part we white got voted out was mad funny f u f u and fu and f your medbay lol
I love how blue votes the same until the end
Music?
He has a gun
Don't worry we'll get em next time
Man blue would be the best imp man lol make it so he’s imp pls pls, pls I will be dying of laughter man
Dude purple is British get him outta here holds a gun at someone perfectly fine
Why is it always blue to who always has to pick if they die or if they live
Note: Vents in medical only lead to electrical and security not reactor so he couldve said "I think you vented into cafeteria and went to medbay and vented into security.".
Why is blue needs to do the victory vote in part 1 and 2 ?
5:57  White F#&#$ you F@&##$ y o u F#&#& YIU  Also white :and F#&$ your little MEDBALWXMZWKZWUWBBBXEJXXEH
bro orange just accused white while purple just standing there holding a g*n
6:10 | “Don’t worry, we’ll get ‘em next time.” DOES THAT NOT SOUND SO FAMILIAR?
Bro purple think he Andrew Tate
People: WHY DID YOU RAT OUT [color] Me: *explains [Player] was banned by [Host]
Do a new one but with roles.
Bro the fact that blue voted himself had me dead XD
I f#*@ing love blue he is so dumb it's funny
Blue is the average randumb
What is blue doing?! 6:33
purple litterally sounded like price in call of duty
*Why does Green always die first :(((*
green: purple is great. i cant wait to see what the future holds for us. purple shoots him right in the face
Don’t worry I don’t trust British people most of the time
Bruh why does purple sound like captain price from call of duty 💀
Oh no, red sus...🤣🤣
5:55"...AND YOUR ******* MEDBLBUBLUBBLBU
Blue: I don't know red's sus
"F*CK YOU AND YOUR F*CKING MEDBJSURJAJDHWKSJDHHDHRH-" 2 years later and that part still gets me dying lmao
I like ya cut g
The fact they don’t see the gun that purple is holding and in episode 1 they didn’t even see the blood all over white
Bule is the most smatest  player 😂
I love h9w he pulls out a gun and they all forget
Not trusting British people is kinda racist
bro at 6:10 it sounded like warzone
Purple sounds like price from cod
First in real life if the imposter purple actually pulled out his gun everyone would know
MAN I REALY GOT MAD BECUSE BLUE IS A MORON
5:52 what every 5 year old wants to say if they don’t get their way
The Hug got me
every one is ignoring the fact that purple sounds like price and even said his line at 6 minutes and 10 seconds in the video
Blue acts like the average among us player
Bro no one noticed that he said "We'll Get 'em Next Time" LIKE CAPTAIN PRICE FROM CALL OF DUTY???
This gives me mad Rooster Teeth's Red vs Blue vibes and I love it.
Purple sounds like Price
i love Blue🤣
Blue clutch. Happened twice
WAit  did purple said shutt the fuck up to  white
The Taco Bell sound😂😂😂
:black all right guys I was just doing my task and then purple was spying on me mad sus :white yeah that's sus : purple all right whoa whoa whoa let me explain :black I don't think we should trust him   :orange wait let's just hear him out  : purple ladies and gentlemen's there has  been survive among us *everyone*panic* :blue wait is it an imposter?  : Purple it's far worse than that *everyone panics* : purple 2 imposters *everyone*  *screams* :white no! Oh my gosh are you kidding me?!
Purple: “How the f#$& did I lose to two idiots who throw their friends out the airlock” also him: it was cyan 💀💀💀
:black all right guys I was just doing my task and then purple was spying on me mad sus : white yeah thats sus!
Med beighlhlglhlghh!
I don’t know but I think this might be the first real life among us video
Whats that intro music?!
Fu and fu and fu and your fu*king medbayguygv. Famous words of White😂
I love Purple he’s awsome
4:08 Lol one of the imposters is purple and he’s British
2:03 Man behind the slaughter
0:31 Black does a Naruto run and 2:20 Green's body is still visible.
The fact that purple is actually Australian is hilarious to me
blues jacket is ripped because hes fat lol
Blue Oh I'm ready *kicks everyone*
White in interview: “That’s the stupidest accusation I have ever heard”  White at the meeting: “That’s the stupidest accusation I have ever heard”  5:56 😂
I'll be like this as imposter at the fanalle 3 SAY GOODNIGHT
Why does purp sound like RHM
Zion is my favorite color
“Threw their friends off the f*cking airlock.”  *So did you purple 💀.*
1:12 blue was showing off his moves
But you can't vent from med to reactor, only to sec and elec
They made the murderous purple guy British, coincidence, I think not.
purple pull out a gun orange"i think its white
Purple really took a gun out
1:53 Ghost
i love the "dont worry we'll get 'im next time"
white: I GET IT MAJORITY RULE WELL F*** YOU F*** YOU F*** YOU ANS YOUR STUPID MEDB- <has an aneurysm>
purple: threatens white with a gun  everyone else: this is ok  purple: threats white again during voting  everyone: this is okay   few seconds later   purple: pulls a knife out his A- as blue stands there dumbly
purple: threatens white with a gun  everyone else: this is ok  purple: threats white again during voting  everyone: this is okay   few seconds later   purple: pulls a knife out his A- as blue stands there dumbly
Orange is a carat
**murders** **self reports** **”it’s cyan”** **leaves without explanation**
Why do they wear spacesuits when the can breathe oxygen
Favorite part is when white is like FU##  YOU FU## YOU AND FU## YOU WITH YOU ATSGSTHEETjsgdiwhsbddh
This is blue the whole time :'I think I killed and I think that red is sus".🔪🔪🔪🛰
I like how black always shocks himself in electric😂
0:50 RACIST!
This is funny 🤪😂🤣🤣🤣😁😄🥲 5:59
1:29 2:03 2:42 2:45 2:48 lol 5:55
He’s cappin I vote white
"HOW THE FUCK DO I LOSE TO TWO IDIOTS WHO THREW ALL THEIR FRIENDS OUT THE FUCKING AIRLOCK"  Still gets me even after 2 years
white: F YOU AND F YOU AND YOUR FING MEDBABAYAYAYAYAYY
"i think i accidentally killed in storage"           "I think it's me"
5:55 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Best part...  White: Wait no you killed him!  Purple: YA KNOW WHAT SHUT THE FU-
"Sometimes the hottest choices require the strongest wills... That was Thanos who said that" -Violet
White: oh I get majority rules right well fuck you fuck you fuck you and your fucking medbafifjcjcjxjxjc
i hate my lige
DO YOU AXIELY KILL REAL PEOPLE?
Tapping the gun on the  helmet was fucking cute!
The last and only time Cyan appeared and Green had his own segment
"I think i accidentally kill him" Dude u are soo funny bule
Dude puple have a gun out he is holding that and u guy think purple the imposter?
DUDE I LOVEEEEEEEEE BULEEEE HE AWAYS VOTE RED IS SOO FUNNY AND YEA RED NEVER ADMIT HE THE IMPOSTER
Dude it just 2 imposter why all the crew mate soo mad
I love Purple's British accent. It's so funny. LoL 😆
blue is so stupid that it wraps back around to genius.
I love these videos
I like it because blue always makes the last choice
Purple is literally Captain Price!
i like how black naruto runs to the button
Also red my fav lol,   RED: DEFLECTING  And i look how they say MY gUy, and blue is also my fav too  and black and purple
Why he always do wires
Lol this video is so funny but purple spying on black made black hit the button
1:11 white trying to do a table flip is hilarious to me
Blue is so damn dumb.
Okay
5:58 are you ok? =T
Fun fact:the boys dont want girls in the game,SUS
What  the  hell
I love  purple
The man behind the Slater
Why does AmongUs but it’s a reality show doesn’t really seem like a reality show
Purple: I like your cut G Blue in the later episode: I like your but G
purple is chad because he decieved them and was chad
Bruh purple bring the gun out and everyone did not see it
My boy green is DUM! OKAY NOT OK PURPLE IS SUPER SUS!!!!!
Purple!!!!!!!!!
How do they make it look so so so real?
The Naruto roll the black did was hilarious
Black did the Naruto run at the beginning
Purple deserves to win but, perhaps Blue was being strategic this whole time. by playing dumb everyone underestimates him. it certainly is annoying that such an intelligent imposter like purple didn't win, but at the same time I find it funny. "how in the f*** do I lose to 2 idiots, who throw their own friends out the f***ing airlock?!"
WELL #### YOU #### YOU AND YOUR ####### BEBE BLELELELELELELELELELELELELELELELE
I hate blue
Make more among us please
They are dum because purple when he had a gun
I love how theyre already physically a suspect like pulling up a gun or being bloody and yet they dont think the impostor is the person who is phisically already an impostor
“He’s british, I don’t think we should trust him” Does this mean I’m sus
Blue is dumb
5:51 White: FINE! I get it majority rules,  Well FXXK YOU! FXXK YOU! FXXK YOU AND YOUR FXXXING MEDBARURGRURHRURHRGU- *White vented out*
It was the man behind the slaughter!!
The man behind tha slaughter of course is purple guy from fnaf.
wait but you can’t vent to reactor in Medbay, Medbay vent can go to Security and electrical.
When purple threatened white was pretty funny
Purples my favourite
When Purple killed green in the meeting I saw greens body lol
Orange: you stupid
Back blue red and cyan are my fav
Eyy the purple has a voice like ghost riley on call of duty
It's always the girls to be voted off first, LOL.
blue best
Black:he’s capin White:**** you **** you **** you jsisufjshsjsinvodnivjskncdihgir
Blue is a genius
8:19 “you’r stupid” 😂😂
Purple: "It would only make sense if you were a complete idio-" ***Realization kicks in***
When black saw pink looking at him he was running like naruto Imagine he said ((I feel like a hokage) after doing that lol
Lol when black at the start was running to the button while doing baritone run 😂
3:44 White: I… I… vote Cyan. Orange: I know it’s you (White). Cyan: Guys, are you kidding me, it wasn’t me. 8:21 Purple vote Blue Orange vote Purple  8:48 Orange: If you vote yourself, you going to die. Vote him. 9:03 Blue vote Purple Orange: Thank God! Yes!

Purple: the imposter would be stupid to kill in front of everyone Also purple: *kills green in front of everyone*
“Honestly, I wish I could vote everyone off the ship.”
OK are red and blue the grif and simmons in this video.....now that I say that I guess they might be.
Has his gun out where everyone  can see it  and  noone  thinks he is  the  imposter
I love how black literally struggles with wires it's hilarious xD
I like how purple literally pointed a gun at white saying he wasn't the impostor.
purple givin mad cod vibes
Poor green he is always as are killed for first
5:51 fave part
Purple: I like ya cut in, G Me: Polite thing to say to the person you are about to murder
Watch 1:36 then 2:03 it is so funny
The intro music was a VIBE i vibed at the intro music
2:33 weren’t they suppose to see the gun from purple-
This is now my favorite show
BLUE: PICKS PURPLE  Orange: Thank God yes BLUE YOU DID IT YES Purple: HELL F##K
Blue: what if I’m an imposter and I just don’t know Red: that’s not how it works
Purp: it’s far worse than that two imposters

How was the second imposter did purple lie about and the then the third one there is two red and blue
BLUE IS SO DUMB
WHEN IS INFINITE LISTS GONNA REACT TO THIS
Hey orange remember the last time you watched white KILL Black
in 9:03    Blue: *THE VOTE REVEALS (VOTED PURPLE)*
0:00 TO 0:09 WHAT IS THE SONG
i can't see green's face
The only reason Purple lost is because he tried winning with logic, all while leaving the two dumbest crewmates alive.
Pov. You alr watch thi and you want to want to watch it again
What do you mean blue never dies in every episode he’s the only one that does not dying every episode
I wish things could go back to October 2020. Where among us got popular, and Halloween came around the corner. Now it’s just school, a m o g u s, and sussy bakas. I miss the old days… 😔
Lol black always gets electrecuted doing wires
Two favorite sayings from purple "sometimes the best place to hide is in plain sight." "Sometimes the best victory is the one you don't fight for."
“black Naruto running”🤣😂😂🤣🤣😂😂🤣😂🤣😂😂🤣
9:08 9:12
Purple : HELL THE F**K  Blue : 😎  Me : haha
I love the Beginning
Purple:kills in front of everyone Everyone:*votes cyan*
Blue wins again
Orange: o2 is going off and I'm the only one fixing it? Don't these people want to breath? Me: I tell everyone in among us that when o2 is going off and nobody but me is fixing it!
Did anyone see the gun purple was holding during the meeting?

Actually it was purple who killed green I saw him killed green
Is it just me is does blue sound really drunk whenever he's not in a meeting?
I I love how even after they won they still think cyan shot green
Why you say it like that
I love how white and blue blue  punching and kicking  wil white lift up the table😂
Blue is always the one who wins at the end

Purple said only dumb people can understand that.  Wait isn’t blue a dumb man
Great writing. I really appreciate how they capture the personality of different types of players in Among Us and different killing styles. Keep it up!!
Blue is how I would imagine a character with 1 intelligence and 10 luck in fallout.
6:41 #Ilikeyacutg
Orange is the most exited person 😂
Stack kill scene was kinda wierd
And why does he always think it him? (-.-)
Why is blue always stupid
1:08
I love how blue is the last hope in voting out the last imposter.

Low key the purple guy sounds like captain price from call duty modern warfare 6:10
*purple points a gun infront of whote and everyone There like nothin Then red thinking its blue even purple point a gun infront of everyone  And purple kills infront of everyone  Cyan just in the back chilling even she imposter but sh doesnt want to kill anyone yet that time.
2:20 like if u saw green's dead body blending on the background
Plot in a nutshell: Blue is an absolute idiot until the very end when he saves the day.
Blue: red is the impostor. red: WTF PURPLE IS. purple:shut up others: cyan is
Black vibing at wires makes my 2020 better Did U see the ninja run though?  *Love the customes *🤣🤣
yah its red hes relley sus

5:51 😂😂🤣🤣😂 rip white
Blue is my favorite blue:aye red:shut up
If Schlatt and Wilbur was one person, he'd be red
I ******* LOVE BLUE
Tbh I don't like blue
It's purple
Are you all dumb?is BLUE BRUH
these are accurate Among Us reprsentations
“Purple is the impostor for sure” Black gets it.
Me as yellow: We have a grave threat aboard this ship. Blue: an impostor? Yellow (me): worse. Red: two impostors? Yellow (me): much worse. There are impostors among us, 3 of them. Green: t-three!?
purple makes 1000000000000000000 iq plays
Hey pls do an Reality Show 5 next week plus add the color brown
Why is green always the one that always get kill first?
2:36 “you’re gonna vote cYAn off”
This is one of the funniest thing I’ve ever seen.  Purple: *as he holds gun in hand* “you know what, shut the f*ck up, heres what we’re gonna do. You’re gonna vote ^cyan^ off” the voice crack😂  Blue: “idk reds sus”  Red: “I see how it is you little f*cker, I tHiNk ItS yOu”  Reds my favorite😂
and purple is the other imposter
how is cyan one of the killer if she didn't kill a person?
El azul es todo un crack
I'm starting to wonder if the girl will be voted off first every time.
Cyan
I love purple
It only makes sense if your a complete idiot. Me: I suppose blue is one
I hate blue
Dark green has a bad luck thats why he get killed firs :/
2:36  *noice voice crack* 👌
Yes yes yed
You know this is a pub lobby when the imposter rats out their teammate to clear themselves smh
So we not gonna acknowledge Captain Price?
2:18 who else sees the green body next to purple on the left
I like this
I loved how purple said I like ya cut g them the taco bell sound happend
I love how purple   pulled out the gun and yelled at white but what have been funnyer is if he said shut the fuck up
🧑‍🦲 Among us be like 🧑‍🦲🧑‍🦲🧑‍🦲🧑‍🦲🧑‍🦲🧑‍🦲🧑‍🦲🧑‍🦲🧑‍🦲 American people be like 🧑‍🦲🧑‍🦲😭😭
when i got strike by lightning 5:59
"It would only make sense if you were a complete idiot." You- you do realize that they're ALL idiots, right? Of course it would make sense then.
Purple kinda sounds like bear grylls
"That's the stupidest accusation I've ever heard."
"But what if I'm the imposter and I just don't know?  That's not how it works dumbf-ck. "
Pff Cyan could’ve just ratted out Purple
Blue did a great job
"I'm not the only one who sees this right? These guys are f-ing morons." Is he wrong, though? The only smart, non-oblivious, people who are in possession of some shred of common sense is purple, of course, black, and maybe red. In the last video, he outsmarted white by convincing blue by claiming that it was him. Also, the rest of the crew is honestly stupid, and the smart people who have a much better chance at finding the imposter are either dead, or ARE the imposter. Orange is finally using his brain.
“I like ya cut G.” 🤣
"I don't get it. O2 is going off and I'm the only one fixing it? Don't these people want to breathe?" I freaking died laughing there.
الازرق غبي 😂😂😂
Red is the best
I cant cap black always vibing at wires lol
Yeah I think blue is dumb
Purple sounds like ghost
Purple: convincing every one it’s cyan Also purple: points Gun at white Every one:this is ok
All the kids (in fnaf)before they got killed: 4:06
Purple is so attractive Major SUSexy vibes
"AND YOU FREAKING ME:DLHUIHLMFIWEMFH<WE"
avenge me!
I love these Puns on TV screen First Samsus now Asus  I know what your trying
When everyone follows a casual it loses point for playing as impostor because too many eyes. Purple simply broke game  But is this me or everyone is Dumb or have issue to see ?
I like to cut g that was the best line in the whole show
When you play with friends but use SpaceX Helmets which look fantastic But you forget that when you have black visor you see shit.
The white saying fuckyoyoyoyogoisnssjjss was fun
C-#.  TS💀🙀😼😻🤕👻🙂🙂🥳😢🤬🤬🤬🤢🤢👹🤮🤥👻

I know blue is so funny that he thinks its red every time 😆
I’m sorry but have you noticed blue literally saves the day at the end of 1 and 2
2:36 were gonna vote *CYAN* off
So he was the man behind the slauter
Purple casually pulls out a gun infront of everyone. Everyone: Thats fine
Blues foolishness is overrated tbh, And Black isn`t a really great actor he makes me feel like if it`s fake. But the personalities that based on the colors and scenario is really awesome...It just like the real game.  Ice job.
5:52 when I'm at a tournament and I get mad at the other team and almost won!!
make a video with medbay it will be cool
Purple is the best imposter made yet. Best among us reality show so scary!
I hate to ruin the moment but does anyone know the intro song??
I still think it’s red

6:47 there was a Taco Bell sound
Does anyone realise that purple is British and he is quoting ghost
Imagine how they would react with 3 imposters
Med bay

YO, will we ever see blue with a hat
You guys should make a video of then when they are dead after they were voted off lol

My favorite lines: Purple: “I obviously didn’t want to kill him in front of everyone, but sometimes the best place to hide is in plain sight” White:  “F—k you, F—k you, F—k you, AND YOUR F—KING MED *BLURBLEHLE-* Black: “He’s British? I don’t think we should trust him” Blue: “oh no! Red sus” Red: “oooohh, she’s neglecting!” Cyan: “Oh yea? And how are you going to do that?” Green: “I can’t wait to see what’s next for purple” Orange: “THANK GOD YES! BLUE YOU DID IT!”
Whats the next show? 3 impostors
Why is it always green that always die in episode 1 2 and 3

I love how blue thinks its him the first time and then the second time he thinks he blacked out and he still thinks its him
Blue actually has 1,000,000 IQ, he just acts dumb to avoid being questioned.
The crew mates are not even seeing purple has the weapon in his hand how does The crew mates not know that that is so easy
Purple: I like ya cut G black and me: Its purple. Purple: **ejected**
I’m always voted out first everyone hates on cyan idk why

Purple quoting Thanos...        Not surprised.

Blue and Red: The Funny guys Orange: the task guy Purple:The cool one Dark green and white:The Normal person Cyan:The high pitched voice Black:The Scaredy cat
So purple is basically thanos and butcher
Black is soo funny
1:07 me in a teacher conference and getting it wrong

Purple sounds like lazarbeam
I watched this like 20 times and only just noticed this voice crack 2:36

I use the white skin with no accessories because I look like a normal astronaut but in all 3 videos white has died :(
We all love Blue.
Wait, purple is an imposter...            THE MAN BEHIND THE SLAUGHTER
Purple is my favourite ''The best way to hide is in plain sight''

Voice crack at 2:35
2:34 that voice crack thoo
Purple bubble is the Killer
Honestly, this show is giving me anxiety, because I've seen all these players in games. It feels SO bad to do everything right and get voted out by the moron conspiracy theorist whose logic is unassailable because it doesn't exist.

Be honest guys who thinks this is a real tv show instead of people making the video AMONG US IN REAL LIFE
Purple is a Pro imposter
I hate blue
That voice crack
2:36 #Voicecrack
We need more series for sure
"He is british, I dont think we should trust him"
5:55 me speaking to my friends when they all flip me off.
White: He is threatening me and holding me at gunpoint ! Others: Nah, he is just a great comedian.
As creative and entertaining as the first episode ! A job well done, team ! New crewmates rock !
Voice crack purple
Ngl kind of expected purple to start saying mission failed will get em next time
Green. Dude purple is great can't wait to see what the future holds for us. purple. kills green in front of everyone.
I hate blues character
Blue is the character
I love the fact that purp and orange both had a voice crack I laughed when Purp was like we gonna vote cYan off and like orange was like BLU you did it YeS!!!
I love my family
I love my family
I’m not first I’m not last But most importantly
6:43 *I like ya cut, G*
Blue is just on a another level in the first episode pretend to be a noob and always had a alibi and in second episode acting like he had killed someone to keep orange alive
0:46 "He's british, I dont think we should trust him" MATE YOU WHAT

White:”wait no u killed him” *purple holds white at gun point* purple:”EVERYONE SHUT THE FUCK UP NOW HERES WHAT WE GONNA DO U GONNA VOTE CYAN” Literally the best line ever
Sertyui
I love that Purple is Captain Price from Modern Warfare
I get that blue is supposed to be the dumb one but there are many dumb ones like black and blue is kind of annoying hearing his voice gives me autism. You obviously don’t have to take him out but can you make him not do those noises with his mouth so much that it gets annoying and repetitive
Blue is my spirit animal
preston can you make part2
Did purple take a knife out of is ass when he was going to kill orange
How come blue always survives to the end?
Ummm sorry orange but you can’t vent from navigation the cafeteria
"Only person who would believe that is a fucking idiot!"     *blue has entered the chat*
only fnaf fans get this one ¨that purple guy¨!!!!!!
Yes vote purple
Im british
Purple is the imposter guys vote him
2:35  Voice crack
If you plan on making a part 3 you can get inspired by the movie ‘The Thing’ Why? Because the game is inspired by the movie.
2:36 lol that voice crack
Why do blue and red always have a problem with each other
Please  Brother you should give only video of among us reality
And your med bay brygg5hfugy
BTW black is smart
2:36 that voice crack is so funny lol
I thought purple would use the "I voted out the first impostor" defense
blue always saves the game
Pruple is the impostor
6:08 he should have said    MISSION FAILED WE'LL GET EM NEXT TIMEE
We solved whos jack the ripper...                     TIS PURPLE GUY FROM FNAF!! also I just realized they both brits

White:and your med blblblbunvjjhfhcgdgdgf If you want a time stamp 5:58
Correct title: two idiots play among us and accidentally win.
I once was in a game where brown (imp) accused cyan (also imp) so no one would suspect brown, and cyan had a hissy fit and called them both out and lost them the game
At the end😂😂😂😂
when they vote purple its black
i think the girl is the first one to get out of the ship
I love how purple can have a gun out and no one gives a shit
5:58 *I FREAKIN CANT*
*wait... vented from medbay to reactor?*
I love that Blue is trying to  Vent
Omg search cookie gamer
The reason no one kills blue is cause he thinks it's himself. Lol
Orange and blue need their own spin off show
Purple: Literally holds a gun to there head Everyone: I'll just ignore that
Blue is my fav😂😂😂😂
In the beginning "theres 2 impostors" later in the vid theres 4 people left and 2 imposters, shouldn't the impostors have won?
Your the best😁☺
I really thought blue was gonna skip vote
White is crazy

Purple: pulls gun out in emergency meeting Me: wait, that’s illegal
I think purple is thanos

Legends say blue still thinks it’s him
Funny
Does anyone know the name of the song they used in the beginning or is it something Laugh Over Life made?
I hate people who rat the other without reason, like just to get trust
Why did purple sound like captain price? 😂😂😅
Ladies first
Nobody:  Orange 🍊:u know Wut i think?

I'm so glad i found this channel
“I think it’s me”   “I think I accidentally killed red in storage”  “I think I blacked out and killed black”
"The imposter behind the sabotage"
How does puprle know there’s two imposters
Blue sounds like a fortnite henchman lol
ITS DISGUISED TOAST!
Blue is my favorite
Why is this the same ending
The amount of references that purple made is uncanny
4:09 red said “I just wish I could vote everyone off the ship” had me laughing
Who watched this after watching infinite’s list’s reaction to it
“That was uh, that was Thanos that said that” aldkfkdksllslflgkfk
Ungu

Purple is best
Good job guys!!!👏👏😁

8:26 am I color blind or is that black
Vote red ehe
It was purple man behind the slaughter
The voice crack when purple said cyan
Blue is so funny
You guys should make one with a hacker on the ship (Eris loris) just a thought that would probably go viral because of what’s going on
Who else to thinks purple sounds kinda like captain price from modern warfare
Lol how come the climactic scenes always have to be blue just using his brain for once?
Blue is my guy who agrees?
Wait. Y the f*** would purple have a gun In front of everyone??? It’s obviously purple???
Purple gives me captain price vibes 😂!
When you lil brother play ur computer= 6:43
2 imposters u have even seen the worst  3 IMPOSTER...
I feel like blue in the end is the one guy who has to choose wether win or lose.
Purple sounds like captain price
2 imposters    Me who is the second imposter: first time?
I just think that Purple Guy is like Captain Price from Call Of Duty.
"That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard" - Everyone
Blue and Red have the best relationship in this series, they are my favorite people in the series lol
I like to imagine they just got done binging "The Boys" and put Butcher in their skit
The amount of "eh's" from blue tho
Hhxgcjsvdjddhdjxbgykhxigxixdydofhodcebzdfghdhvehgfhrhfhdydgrehgdgrhsgeheeghdfhfhueoegfidhsiruehruehdhpaghfxhkzudididududideiuduueydoegdlxvbjgdheufjwykeuwnwhrhgdhfhfgdhfggffskdfuey5piwhdyxgyw7rurtfeggdfrggdrffegete7wf use jeff

Black still haven’t completed the wires task
The "and your medical baiaiehwkwjw" got me
“I like ya cut g”
Purples like a head taller than all of them😂😂
Can you make a part 4 plz
Even if you are imposter all you have to say is If not him me and people vote fast as hell
8:14 Orange you can’t vent from nav to cafe you can only vent from nav to weapons, sounds pretty sus orange
"I think I must have blacked out and killed him in nav."  -Blue 2020
Who also want to see a Alien-Kill

In all my time playing/watching Among Us, I think purple is the smartest Imposter I've ever seen
Blue is the best lol
Nobody: Blue: *I think it's me*
It funny how purple shot green and everyone heard the shot and then purple pulls a gun out and nobody question it
Blue not cyan: I think it’s blue
It’s me again, and the same song played again 9:00, and he did the same thing as last time
I like your cut g
Hey don’t insult my country and that’s not a English ascent
damn the girl always dies first
I like your cut g.
O
I like how blue is retarded
my old skin was cyan with a warning sign named puddle, how did they find out?
So literally it was purple but he told them that his partner was the imposter to solve other one would think that he wasn’t the imposter🤣
2:36 *at gunpoint* you are going to vote cYAn off *lol a voice crack*
AY, BLUE MVP
Captain price
But didn't purple win already because last two crewmates left
Get it orange GET IT.  YES BLUE YOU DIDNT VOTE FOR YOURSELF

"he's BRITISH, I don't think we should trust him." the best quote so far
I'm blue lol
I Love blue so mucj

Wow, another disappointment that the Imposter didn't win.
PUCK
Dam
You see purple has a gun he didn't even report
Shit
Blue is so scared that there are two imposters that he kicks air
“Sometimes the hardest choices require the strongest wills.” The fact that he’s purple just makes it better
Nah i think is red

I love how orange is always voting weirdly, how blue is a literal idiot, and once black says „for sure“ he dies the next round.
He votes him self when he’s not imposter
Dark blue is so annoying
For part 3 can you do a different map
Us British don’t speak like purple it’s so annoying  But great vid all the same
You know why purple knows cause he was imposter with cyan
3:00 Blue seems kinda sus, copying off of Bow from She-Ra.

When green says can't wait to see purple in the future green just dies XD
Bro purples voice crack
Purple killed green Infront of everyone:  Crewmates: Its Cyan Its white Blue: Red Sus
Plot Twist: Blue is actually the smartest crewmate. He just pretends to be dumb.
Очень круто  был бы еще русский перевод Субтитры не охото читать
Purple: *Holds white at gun point*    Everybody else: "I like purple, hes great!"
Purple: "Like your cut G" *shoots in face*
Cyan: "Guys, it wasnt me!!!! "  Red: *pokes visor* "Ooooooooo, she's deflecting!"   Cyan: I vote white, he's sus.   Red: *pokes visor* "Deflecting"
Thare are not 2 imposter s

Blue should be the imposter in part 3
You should make a part 3
Blue is my favorite who is your favorite? :3
I think they should've ended this differently from the last video. It all got down to depending on blue again, the dumbest crewmate. And by getting convinced at the last minute the crewmates won again :/
Blue
WHERE TF IS PINK?!!?!??!?!?
Purple = thanos
Ya know racism isn’t just about skin tones it’s about where people are from and saying you shouldn’t trust the British one is racist
red and blue are my fav bro😭👏🏾
“I like your cut G” 😂
uhahaha nice team lol
so funny blue thinks imposter is himself
Blue makes me want to kill myself
I love blue because is he dump
Honestly blue is so dumb but his dumbness is so helpfull and like from part one blue was like its red but aside from part two he blames red and red thinks its blue and blue agrees😂😂😂

I love how Purple kills Green in front of everyone and I love Purple says to everyone 2 impostors and and everyone said oh no are you kidding me
That feeling when you always end up like Cyan.
Do one with blue being the imposter that will be so funny
blue is so dumb
GURL WHITE IS SO ME CAUSE' THEY ALWAYS THINK ITS ME! SO I SAY " NO  IM NOT THE IMPOSTER" BUT STILL THEY VOTED FOR ME EVERYTIME!😑

white and blue are my spirit people
I like this type of videos I wish they could be in Netflix
Do other maps
Can you make another one where yellow is imposter and he has the rapidly promoted executive hat and he wins
Purple:I like your cut G Black:What what!" Lines token before disaster.
2:08 😂😂😂
NOOOO DAD!!
How do they not realize that purple has a gun
i think i want for the 3rd episode of among us is that the blue one is the imposter😅
I use the color purple in among us and now i feal British
I like how blue voted himself the whole time
make blue imposter
Poor Green. He's always the first one to die.
Orange: I think this Purple man is great!  Me: Never trust a Purple man! NEVER EVER!
I think it’s me 🥶
Next time make blue imposter
Orange was sus ngl 👁👄👁
This is why the imposters should always kill blue first
Do Mira Hq next
voice crack when purple said “We’re gonna vote CYan off”
Blue: Is dumb, and always votes for red, but somehow saves the day at the end. Red: Usually listens to what everyone says, and is always voted by blue. Orange: Loves tasks, over-explains everything, usually votes white. White: Gets voted by orange every time, is smart sometimes, but usually dumb. Black: Over-uses certain phrases, and dies to the imp after finding out who they were. Cyan/Pink: Gets voted off after not doing anything. Purple: British, and is really smart. Green: Dum
4:05... does that ring a bell?

Sometimes as impostor the riskiest move you have to make in order to stay innocent is to find a way to rat out the other impostor
Purple though
Make a third one
Orange is also known as a carrot
Lol me waiting for a part three
That wasn't a British accent though, it was Australian.
William Afton be like: the purple
رعرلالغ لب غبا يس يسقس يب
6:43
5:52 when I get voted out as the imposter
Blue actually dumb with smart disisions
I still think it's red... he's real sus... 😒

Purple: *holds are gun in the meeting** Everyone: ignores.

Reality show 1:Blue saves the crewmates Reality show 2:Blue saves the crewmates Overall:Blue has short term memory loss Sorry blue
New among us
"I like ya cut g"
Who will be the Imposter black or orange or green
Why is orange like me but censored? And on a weaker scale
It only makes sense if you're an idiot! Well... Blue seems like an idiot tbh😅no offense
Its gonna go right to three on the third then 4 then 5 then onward
More
Ever thought  about  doing  a video on medkits like gamers trying to  use them in  real life  but can't  get them  to  work
The girl always gets voted off first
“I like ya cut g”
black: He's British, I don't think we should trust him  *His accent sounds Australian to me*
I ship white and orange
I was really hoping for purple to win
Part 2 yEs
IT'S BEEN SO LONG SINCE THEY LAST HAD WALKED AMONG  LOST TO THIS MONSTER TO THE MAN WHO'S THE IMPOSTER
harith:i know who is the imposter its purple & cyan black:well i get it because cyan & purple

6:43 I LIKE YA CUT G

“What if I’m the impostor, but I don’t know?”😂😂😂😂😂

Red and blue are my fav they just make me laugh lol
I hit the subscribe button for part three. I cant wait😁😁😁
Captain Purple Price: "Don't worry, we'll get'em next time"
Pls part 3
Yes there is literally a blue in every game that I play. The person who is dumb the entire game but comes in clutch at the end
white say medbay like "medbaaaaay"
6:42 no words 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Actually purple sounds like he's from Australia
Purple: I like ya cut G   Toco Bell: Oh here you go...
If among us was a reality tv show 3 add working vents
ok so without red he thinks its himself now
Purple: I like it cut g. Black: Hu?
6:43
So know heard when he said I LIKE YOUR CUT G
At 8:05, Orange says "Vented from Medbay to Reactor." But vent in Medbay connects to Security and Electrical.
This is why having a dumb crewmate in your team is very dangerous.
Hi s again, im white
Hello
Hi s  Im white
How did they not suspect purple from the beginning- He pulled out his gun during the meeting ;-;
Mostly when purple killed black. It sound like "I like your cat g"
4:08 me every among us game and I get voted out-
Everyone but purple: ya. He's British to I don't think we should trust him  Me: since I'm half british, do you not trust me either?
I like how blue always is in the last round and then suddenly does the right decision lol
Do another among us but it’s a reality show 3 please
Among us is amazing
I like ur cut g
"he's British, I don't think we should trust him" me, who is british:,|,,
I love these among us realiaty shows, so can u pls make more?
Plz do a part 3
Blue: he sees purple kill green red es suuus. Red: wth?
So funny
Blue it my favorit
I think this purple guy's great   Little did they know he was the man behind the slaughter
I subscribed
*I think it's meh*
Bet that in the next episode red and blue will be the imposters!
Reds sus....
Only legends can like this did somebody notice that in part 1 and 2 green died first
Blue got on the spot lol
Purp do be saying truths
They should do one were the impostor wins
what day you will release part 3 among us
2:04 that was epic
6:24 his mouth ain't moving pal
(BRITISH ACCENT) "I loik ya cut g"  That got me lmaooo
Another episode plz
Why blue so stupid yet he's always the final decision 😭😭
2:36 I think no one mentioned that his voice was cracking when he mentioned "Cyan" Good video by the way! Keep it up!
6:45 I like ya cut g
So we not gana talk about how purple sounds like captain prise
LOL
Blue is my favorite character
i hate purple purle is noob purple ugly
Purple said I like or cut g
Purple sat I like or cut g
Purple: “lets not act like children..” Blue: *non-audible gasp*
3:58 when you vote out the impostor based on wrong evidence  *task failed successfully*
pink and cyan are the same person like if you noticed. they have the same voice.
purple “pulls out a gun” crew keeps talking
ah yes, green always get killed first.
Blue always says: "hda hda hda"
This is so funny😂 great job!
Part 3 pls
This Is Fun Lol
Purple:Holds a gun in a meeting  Everyone else: I am gonna pretend I didn’t see that
3:57 Is everyone gonna ignore the fact that the tv brand is ‘A SUS’
Blue has 100% winrate
Everyone’s getting offended by the joke about British people      I’m british and I agree with the joke 😂
I feel bad for green he was first to die both vids
At the beginning, me: purple sus
Yea but red can be an imposter cause he was the created among us
A more realistic game would be Cyan saying "I'm a girl" and then the simps voting off the person who accused her
Purple guy
Two idiots who throw their friends out the f word airpock
Among us rhymes with Among sus
I think blue always vote red and after red ejected and himself and blue always vote a impostor when there is a 3 people left lol
why didint you vote purple whiye
why does green always die first whyyyyyy
Purple litterally pulled out the gun in front of everyone
Why kick first time a girl? in 1, and 2 kicked first time a girl. Guys, why?
Good jop please part 3
pls make more i love this show!
Blue acts as if he’s like a 5 year old, buts that’s why I like him
Please make more there epip

IlikurcutG
Purple: *Sometimes the best place to hide is in plain sight*  Quote of Among Us 2020

blue and red are like Dwight and Jim from The Office
We need more of these series
Wait what
That poor girl is always getting kicked out first😂😂😂

Blue is always the hero in the end :)
They should make a third one where the imposter wins.  Edit: And they did.
Good👍👍👍👍👍👍

I demand  bule to never be an impostor  but he wins all the time
Purples and pasta because don't worry we  will get him next time
Erm. The first one is better. This is just silly.
LLP hi
I love how you put in kitchen knight nightmares effect
Green always died first
One like = For green (He died first in Part 1 and now 2) PRAY FOR GREEN TO ALIVE IN PART 3! PRAY AND LIKE!
Conviction Prediction : Blue is next Imposter

Red was my favourite crewmate :(
We need a part 3 like if you agree

How how did blue again make the right choice
I LIKE YA CUT G
Next Time Blue is the impostor
Part 3
2:55 One Time I was afk at the beginning but I was the Impostor but I didnt saw that my Name is Red LOL.I thougt I was a crewmate and didnt kill anyone but still got voted out because someone randomly lied that I vented LOL.
The Blue guy isnt funny. He kills the show tbh
The crewmate behind the slaughter
Red and Blue really make a good partnership tbh
Blue when he hears 2 imposters:IMMA WHOOP YO IMPOSTER ASS
Other final:  Purple wasn't an impostor. Orange: YESSS, thank you god!!!
Purple could have blamed orange and said orange blamed white and didn't vote cyan because he didnt want to vote his partner out and vent out from the dead body.
Last round white blamed orange. Next round orange blamed white.
"He's British I don't think we should trust him"
0:32 Naruto Run 😂
White was hilarious 🤣
Why dose purple sound like captin price a little
Can we have more of this?
How it orange alive he got killed
subscribed plzzzzz add so nice
This is actually really interesting to watch
u said heb is british i dont trust him that is  rude
2:36 voice crack

Please make a 3rd edition of this because my son and I really like watching it together
Blue in a nutshell: I want to die.
You should make more this video make me laugh 🤣
This is a secret love story between red and blue
It was as entertaining as the game. Keep up the good work guys!!
I got recommended this      Everyone liked that
*blue is the best character*
I want more screen time for the lime green

purple is literally Disguised Toast
YOU MUST MAKE AN EPISODE WHERE THE CREWMATES LOSE
Yesssss you guys made another one!!
Why do the girls always get voted first?! Have some respect with girls -
Bruh u need a third episode
I hit it
Why is green always the first one dead
why does the girl always get voted out first?
Purple pulls out gun     Everyone still voted cyan
To happy that orange was not dead
Blue strike every time
Voice crack lmao 2:36
You want to listen to this song called "Show Yourself" from CG5
Make blue the imposter yet.
omg i hate blue
Yeah No if purple ratted me out like that i would be like FUCK THAT you gettin out with me. This actually happened to me in a game. I normally main Cyan and I killed in front of my imposter partner purple in admin. He voted me out by reporting for no reason and saying I killed But I took him down with me.
imagine of this was the actual Supreme Court jury
I lost it when purple said “I like ya cut g”
It,s really fake
I love blue
MEN I LOVE THAT FAT GUY
*i think its me*
Purp killing everyone in plain sight actually happened when i was playing and it worked...
Like always I’m vibin at wires while watching this
Why does cyan have a slippery floor sign? Actually, why does everyone haw something on their head?
^Purple sees black^ Purple: I like ya Cut G Black: wait what? Purple: Closes Doors  #ilikeyourcutg            It’s all away to  6:40
2:36 that voice crack tho
We need more plz
Why the hell they have to kill green first 😡

I love to see blue and red being impostor together 😂😂😂
5:46 This is why I love blue
If you would do a part 3 add pets in
Omg…               purple guy was the imposter
When you Guys are going to make Henry stickman because its made by the same people. who made Among us
did i hear purple voice crack..
1:08 green lmaooo
Purple: theres two imposters White: **lifts table** Blue: **punches the air**
hi please do a part 3 and i'm  british  but you can trust me
Legendary
The best part in this is that the "Vented to Cafe then went to medbay and vented to reactor" is flawed logic because medbay doesn't vent to reactor, it vents to security. You won't believe how many times I've lost as impostor because of completely flawed logic and just straight up unrelated things ("YOU WERE STALKING ME". "I don't even remember seeing you (because I wasn't stalking them)" "VOTE THEM OUT!)
N
2:36 purple voice crack
Basically only one impostor because cyan was voted out on the first round
Blue's my favXD He was so funny!!! LMAO XD It was even FUNNIER when blue didnt even know if he was the imposter or not HAHAHAHAH XDDD
Blue: I think it’s me  Purple: it’s cyan
They should do a imposter victory
Blue can be the impostor?

6:11 sounds like captain Price from modern warfare lol
imposter3

He was vibing at wires again
I thought thered be a twist ending: there was actually 3 imposters and blue kills orange in the end 😂
WHERE'S BROWN?
Petition for Among Us but it’s a reality show 3 with a double kill   I   I  V
of course purple was the crewmate behind the slaughter
dark blue makes smart choices when it was him, purple and orange
5:08   Blue: I think I accidentally killed in storage   Everybody else: Understandable have a great day.
Black did the Naruto run! Lmao
Blue should have had the dum paper
Orange: I really thought White was an impostor. Black: I think its Purple FOR SURE Blue: *I think its MEH!*
6:11 is some call of duty war zone shit
If they make a 3rd one i want blue to be the impostor
" how do I vent like orange "  " Why are my name and lime's name red? " " what does sabotage mean I'm new " " How close do I have to be to kill "
Ikr
Make more of these they’re so fun to watch!
Purple: ‘Cyan why would you kill Green in Public?’  If I was Cyan I just be like ‘Purple your killer too!’
Why didn't purple vent in navigation

Why does green die first

Orange: Wanna know what I think?  White: No, not really.  Purple: No, not really.

"Guys, I think it's me."- The way I play Among Us every time.

The real impostor is the one that kills the other impostor😂
Pls add me next episode. The name is NoSecrets. Orange's aqquaintance. My joke that i want to add: NoSecrets: "Heya, Orange! Huge fan! The name's NoSecrets." Orange: "Hi!: Lime( last game he was blue ):"I think blue sus he stole my colour." NoSecrets: "Wait wha-" *NoSecrets Was an Impostor. 1 impostor remains.*

w“For YHWH so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. John 3:16 	Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets:  I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. 	For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one  jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled. 	Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments,  and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of  heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be  called great in the kingdom of heaven. Matthew Chap 5  no matter what you've already done the messiah's sacrifice makes you totally clean when you accept the messiah as your lord you gain total access to heaven there is a specific plan for you prepared by God if you have any questions about it do a simple test ask God to show you that He exists and loves you
I can see they face..

PLEASE TAKE THE TIME TO READ THIS. IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU COULD EVER DO AND IT ONLY TAKES A FEW MINUTES ARE YOU 100% SURE THAT IF YOU DIED TODAY THAT YOU WOULD GO TO HEAVEN? (CLICK 'READ MORE')  There are some things that you should know:  1. Realize that you are a sinner and in need of a Savior:  Ro 3:23 "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;"  Ro 3:10 "As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:"  It all began when the first humans, Adam and Eve were created and God put them in the garden of Eden. God created them perfect to live in fellowship with Him. There was no death or sorrow. God told them not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. They disobeyed God and as a result, sin entered into the world. The pain, which this world sees, is the result of sin.  2. Because of our sins, we die both spiritually and physically, but God sent His Son to die so that you can have a chance not to have to go to hell by accepting what He did on the cross:  Ro 6:23 "For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."  Ro 5:8 "But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us."  Every person who has ever lived is a sinner and is not righteous because we do bad things. A sin is a crime against God, just as if you steal something at the store, it is punishable by going to jail. It's the same thing with sin. Lying, stealing, sex before marriage, pride, hatred, ect. are all sins. Hell is a prison for those who commit crimes against God. That’s because you must be perfect in order to get to heaven. No matter how well you live your life from then on, you have already sinned, which will be punished if you are not pardoned. If you commit a crime, and then live as a good citizen you still will go to jail for the crime you committed. Right? Just as the President can pardon a crime so you won't go to jail, Jesus can pardon your sins so that you do not go to hell, and can go to heaven when you die. You won’t have to pay for your own sins because Jesus already did that for you. But if you reject the pardon that He offers, you will have to pay for your own sins by going to hell.  3. If you will confess Jesus Christ as Your Lord, place your Faith in Him and Believe in your heart that He died, shed His blood and rose again as a sacrifice for your sins, you will be saved (from hell).  Heb 11:6 But without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.   Heb 9:22 And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.  You cannot get to heaven by being a good person, going to church, baptism or any other way other than by turning to Jesus, believing in your heart that He died on the cross and rose from the dead for your sins and placing your Faith in Him. While these are good things to do, some people believe that they will get to heaven, but your Faith must be in Christ and His sacrifice alone and nothing else, giving your life to Him.   Eph 2:8,9 For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast.  Ro 10:9,10;13 "that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved..For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."  4.  You must submit your life to Jesus Christ and His will in Faith, believing in your heart that He died and rose again shedding His blood to pay for your sins as a sacrifice to God.  If you want to accept Jesus free gift of salvation, or if you have any doubts about whether or not you are going to heaven, HUMBLY PRAY THIS PRAYER TO GOD FROM YOUR HEART IN FAITH:  ”Dear Lord Jesus I know that I have sinned against you and need you to save me.  I believe that You are the Lord and believe in my heart that You died on the Cross and Rose from the dead, shedding your blood as a Sacrifice for my sins.  I turn to You as the only way of salvation, I submit my life to you, placing my Faith and Trust in You as Lord of my life, Please save me and I thank You for it, in Jesus holy name, Amen.”  If you have placed your faith in Jesus Christ and meant it with all of your heart, you are now a child of God and will go to heaven. Now that you are on your way to heaven, you should attend a bible believing church and follow in baptism

I like how blue the stupidest but the still gets it right
Screen: purple wasn’t an imposter Blue: I think it’s meh. Orange: …well then who is it? Ghost: I have taken revenge
Blue is the best character, most people may think he isnt but we both have our own opinions (But My opinion is clearly correct)
8:40 purple is so me 🤣🤣🤣😂 majority of among us players are in fact complete morons lmao 😭
I  need to see more 😂😂
6:11 my man said a call of duty line

When there’s three people left and u know who the imposter is and the other guy knows it too and I win and then u and that same guy get imposter the next round. True friendship 😌
I forgot blue
Why the girls get voted out first 🙄😂
Episode 3: Red and Green are the Impostors, and The Crewmates are Cyan, Purple, Pink, Orange, Black, and White.
Wait,wait they said there was 2 impostors
"The dumbest is always the hero" doesn't lie
Everybody: I think it’s cyan Purple: *pointing gun at people*
I was hoping that blue voted for orange so it would tie
waiting for the third part

Purple latterly polded out a gun! Lol
WHERE IS YELLOW
Hi can you please make part three I really really like the lien my brother always watch it

How come you guys vote the only woman out first both times 😕
Did anyone else think of Billy Butcher when purple said “diabolical” in a British accent?
Blue is my fav 💕
I hated blue in the first one but in this I think he is funny
😹 purple said «I like your cut g
Can you make a 3rd
Why does Blue always get the last vote to save everyone else on the ship? I mean it's amazing but... Ya know...?
blue be dumb tho
Blue Episode One: ITS RED  Blue: Episode Two: I THINK ITS ME
I still love Fire Emblem so much
I think it’s me- Blue
They should add the ghosts
Blue’s voice makes this 1000x better
I feel like blue is either going to be an imposter or die in part 3
They should put this Video on TV. Its rlly good tbh....
The first and the second among us the girls go early died
i feel like in the next one they will have 3 imposters
The second imposter was kick out way to fast
THIS DUDE
is thes real
1:37 Why is green put a sticky note that says “DUM” in his face? IDK

I actually wanted to see annoying blue die
Why is the girl always going first😂😂
Where do you get your helmets from?
I like it how green is always the first one to die
Is it just me or did purple have a voice crack
Next ep should be blue and red as imposter
We need an episode in which imposter should win.Like who agrees
Woah tommyinnit's role has been swapped to he's british i dont think we should trust him...
Poor Green! always the first to day! could you make a ghost character?!
Part 3 blue does the same thing 😂
00:47 me who’s British: *intense madness*
You can't silently threaten in the actual game like purple did on the first meeting.
I love this thing
I LOVE BLUE LOL
awe that's the exact way I like cyan :3 so cute lmao
YES PURPLE SAID I LIKE UR CUT G
It really is like a reality show...       Using the same punchline multiple times in a row
*why is blue so dumb-* Edit: Well, blue always makes the right decision in the last round.
https://youtu.be/n1sXiboMGk8
Why are almost all the characters wearing thing's but in the first episode only red was wearing something
omg
That one friking guy: 3:36 , 5:46 , 6:20 , 7:13
PART THREE THIS IS SO GOOD
?
We need part 3
Im proud of blue
Floor gang song vibe
Please say there is a part 3 where blue is the imposter
I love these pls make more
Blue is the typical Clueless Guy who has luck in the end
something creepily similar happened on the game I played yesterday but just a little different. white reported the body, and purple and cyan were there. purple said its cyan, cyan said its white, white said either cyan or purple. white was voted out but they were not the impostor. then next body purple said its cyan, so cyan got voted off. turn out cyan is indeed impostor so purple gained total trust of everyone. and yup purple won the round as impostor. I felt so played that time but it was a gg tho
Purple: *points gun to white* yOu WiLl vOtE cYaN!                                                       White: ok ok sorry cyan 😔🔫👈🏽😈             *Cyan was an imposter, 1 imposter remaining*
Weres green?
love it but can green please get a bit more cam time
What, where , who, skip
In the memes it says that red is sus but the memes never lie
When they vote cyan it actually says she’s the imposter
Blue carry 2 gameO(∩_∩)O
Why does purple sound like ghost from modern warfare
I think its meh!     -Blue 2020
Why does the girl always die like close to first
Make show 3 and make blue and black and red
Wait there was 2 imposters only 1 was in ejected
Lmao everyone knew Blue was too stupid to be the killer even though he kept admitting it 👌🏾😂
Lmao purple really said " I like your cut G" 😂😂😭
Lmao I loved the Oxygen joke!!! 😂  The dude with the plant was the only one fixing it. Nobody else gave a shit. Global warming in a nutshell.
Try actually tricking yourself into thinking it's a real game... being fake and acting tough is for hollywood...
6:43 i like your cut g
IM NOT SUS BRUH
Blue is always the hero😂😂😂😂
Blue is kinda sus....
I love among us reality show
6:43 :whenever I'm the imposter and I find someone alone in electrical
I like these videos a lot, they are pretty good.
Black: the one who has some kind of sense to know who the killer is...also he’s VIBING AT WIRES White: the wildcard. He’s the average player with an average IQ.  Orange: thinks wayyyy too outside the box. Blames and points fingers at random people because they did something sus for a second. Red: doesn’t do tasks. Is the realist of the group. Is usually sus(according to blue) Blue: the clutch who may or may not be a genius. Votes one person whole game and switches mind at the end, causing a victory for the crew. Green: niave. Will trust quite easily. Dum. Cyan: voted off first. She literally didn’t do shit. Gets ratted out lol. Purple: he communicates in movie quotes. British accent..therefore..can’t be trusted.
Purple  💜  is actually the imposter
Pulls out a gun “ HERES WHAT WERE GONNA DO WERE GONNA VOTE cYaN OFF”
Last vid Green died first and a girl gets voted off and the second epidode green died and a girl gets voted off
"We'll get em next time".... Why does that sound familiar....
Almost 600k subs ! Congrats
Coloca legenda em português :/
Black was running on the "naruto style" 😂😂
purple did the funny
Do among us 3 I'm really enjoying it, it's very funny
Nobody: Blue: I think it's me. 😂😂
I want part 3!😒
the gun
Nobody: Comments: *purple had a gun in front of everyone* White: 5:55
why purple sound like Ghost from COD?
People accually be like this in real games
🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷
Pls make a part 3
That purple man do be sounding like Captain Price
5:55 Moms when they're mad
Blue is cool.
It takes mad courage for orange,white and the other crewmates to not leave the game after getting crewmate
Brah blue never dies I swear 🤣
Purple is a former military named Captain price
Ahahahahaha
It’s purple he killed green
Black is pro player but no one hear black opinion
Blue is the Patrick Star of this entire show.
This is irritating
YES I SUBSCRIBED, IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THE PART TWO
blue: i think its red blue part 2: i think its me
It'so crazy!
Billy Butcher
Blue is so annoying 😭😂
Pls more
Yoo.. is black that hitchhiker guy from that meme??
I heard people get sub's for saying random words so bed
It always boils down to Blue
The greatest strategy of the game is kill the blue first
you forgot to add the part where nothing of interest ever happens and every episode is over dramatized or fake
Pls make more
6:42 i like ya cut g
This time the u guys swear
Yay!!
Wow 😮 i always be nice but no one believes me 🥺and this is how I play among us like ur vid

Purple kills green everyone is brain washed looking entirely to orange and didn't even who killed in front from eye to eye, thats what asshole do in among us.
I love blue he gets better over time XD
The females always get voted off first lol
purple reminds me of Butcher from the boys 😂
5:58

Hahahahaahahahahahahaha
https://youtu.be/BLUkgRAy_Vo
Book your "Before 10 million veiws tickets" here
I think its green
i think it's yellow...

"He's British, I don't think we should trust him."  That's the best play I've ever seen.
Why does purple kinda sound like he’s mean’t to be captain price
3 impostors in part 3 ?
Blue always out here clutching a victory
I love these reality shows :3
How about one where impostor wins smh
0:06 that is got to be the worst button sticking out of the table ever
Am I the only one that wants an "Add Friend" button in among us?
There's always a blue...
Blue lowkey sounding like Katsuki Bakugo- Only me?- Okay-
Blue was always funny XD
Is black is rice gum

My fav was blue when the first one came out i was like it has to be blue i have to like him
Part three bro,  Luv u r Vida😁
Just want to let everyone know Rev. In the Bible is playing out. Please if you haven't already, choose Jesus as your Lord and Savior and accept his gift of dying on the cross for our sins, confess with your mouth and repent of your sins and ask the Holy Spirit to come into your life and turn from sins. Have a relationship with God and read the Bible. KJV is a good place to start. I love you all and God loves you more!!  😃💝🙏💐
NOT RED HES MY FAV
G
Congrats 🎉🎉🎉! You found an Indian
can you make a another episode
Lmao that Naruto run tho 💀
Everybody: talks about how he's British we can't trust him Me:a huge Fnaf and Markiplier fan. Also me: PURPLE GUY
Well, blue did it again.
I like how orange is being 🍊
Blue is officially my favourite character 🤣
These guys are so stupid
I bet that they’ll make part 3
Purple sounds like right hand man
I think blue will survive all the episodes
Damn purple with the voice crack 2:36😂😂😂

Purple is basically Billy Butcher if he played among us
purple seems kinda like bear grills
Funking epic brooo awesome mannn loved it broo waooo plz keep making this its awesome .
2:33 so funny
Blue always wins lol
The stack kill was so good! 2:03 Like it really happens that way that we don't know who killed it.... It's true that in stack kill imposter gets away everytime

I find it easier to kill in a crowd... nobody realises who the real imposter is then 😂
SO LOVELY
He ligit pointing a gun at him and he does not even care
yellow is still sus....
Funny dudee😀😀😀
Blue keeps making dumb arguments throughout the entire session. Yet so far he'd always make the right choice on the last straw. And always survived.
Yessssss part2 is here bois
I think you guys should find more girls bc the one girl there is gets voted out first
I think they got the other impostor on the wrong evidence because they are saying cyan killed green, but it was purple
What song did they used in the beginning?
I WANT MORE
6:43 *I like your cut g*
More among us
I be watching these with popcorn
Why is it always up to blue lol

Me reacting to white: theres always that one guy 5:55
I think its me
OMG MAKE MORE MOREEEE WHEN I AM THE EMPOSTER I ALWAYS LOSS AND THEN WHEN I AM NOT THE IMPOSTER SAYS IS ME UGH F
Blue is very stupid, but Is always the last to vote and has to vote the imposter out of like two ppl. It’s like blue is a hero but isn’t .-.
They should make a movie 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
This guys are so sensitive
Lol, cyan hat
Purple had a voice crack
How about add mini crewmate?
I like you cut g (dong)
Why is it green that gets killed first blue be like   blue: idk red is kind sus  -blue 2020
5:53 Just leaving this for myself
Does anyone know where the helmets are from? I can't find them anywhere.
Well everyone has 0 iq
2:35 That voice crack makes this scene even better.
Note to self: You can’t trust anybody...
Blue always wanna vote red😂😂😂
Would’ve been funnier if blue voted red right after he was killed
I enjoy being purple in Among us cause I can make a bunch of Fnaf references, Plus I am THE DOGE BEHIND THE SLAUGHTER :>
blue is my favorite
Blue is an complete idiot 😂
I HAVE A SUGGESTION FOR PART 3!!!  PLEASE DO PART 3 IN A DIFFERENT MAP

Blue is my favorite
Can you do a Part 3 Where There’s Mini Crewmates or You can show people be ghosts Or a Plot twist where dark blue is not dumb,Like so he Sees This!
Make this a Netflix Show

Blue is an idiot but last he wins
https://youtu.be/AAhZoHxhLwQ
4:50 Can someone please tell me what the name of this music is?
No one  Black Naruto runs to emergency button
Green: Me again...
I really want one where Red is actually the imposter all along, and blue’s trying to tell everyone, but they think he’s just making accusations.
It’s even funnier when you realize you’ve been in every characters shoes 😂😂 not this blue tho. Definitely episode 1 blue.

Purple was holding out a pistol. That’s not suspicious at all.
https://youtu.be/YzfUWA8-32s
i just heard i like ya cut g lol
There should be double kill by imposters next time And maybe imposters winning the game That would be different
Not gonna lie the button looks like a sausage patty
Oh, a part 3 is coming?
Blue be like why you so mean to me purple
i love among us
that blue susing red could have kept using it, it wasnt getting old
to be perfectly honest, I wanted purple to win
I still think it’s red
Don't worry we'll get um next time
Never trust an English man Me, a English boi:
I hope In the next episode, blue is the imposter. And instead of killing people like a regular imp. Has the crew mates vote each other out without him lifting a finger.
I thi k it's much better if all the crew line up together in a straight line while watching a task then suddenly purple kill someone with a knife. The camera view should be at the back of the line while purple murder someone just like in the game so that everyone could not figure it out who did the killing
Blue: i like ya cut g Me: I thought they weren’t allowed to talk unless its a meeting
"I'm a survivalist,and logic is my compass" - Purple   "Sometimes the hardest choices,require the strongest wills...that was uhh...Thanos who said that" -Thanos - Purple  "Don't worry we'll get em next time" - Purple  "Sometimes the best victory,is the one you don't have to fight for" -Purple  "The pieces have landed,the pawns are in place,now time for checkmate" - Purple  "A wolf doesn't hunt with...Honestly you guys see it right!? These guys are f*cking morons,I'm not the only one who sees this,RIGHT!? - Purple
These guys are smart for capitalizing of the growing trend of Among Us. Fantastic use of capitalism! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Very good
0:56 As usual, you’ve done it again.
Purple suspiciously holding that gun at the beginning. 🤔
I WANT A PART 3!!!!!!!
They voted her out and that means they not simps
Make the part 3 on Maria HW Make the part 4 on Polus
Before Blue: "It's definitely red" Now Blue: "I think it's me"
Blue always wins
Can’t wait for episode 3
Funny story that actually happens in match when your imposter but you didn't kill anyone but it was your partner and still got blame lol

and your medbayasgfsdbs
Anyone wanna talk about the fact he sounds exactly like the cod announcer
2:35 voice crack lol
You should do a part three but with hacker
U should do a POV of the ghosts next episode
The most frustating part of having two impostor and that one Is you it's: YOU DIDN'T KILL ANYBODY BUT u are an impostor  it's like- _YES i'm shit but i didn't do shit yet!!!_  +So just cuz u didn't do anything as an impostor We can't vote u? - ex fucking actly!!!
Please episode 3
Do more of these pleeeeeaaaaassseee
Me when i'm imposter: Purple  Me when i'm crewmate:  orange
You should make blue the imposter and then he wins

Idk red sus
"He's British I don't think we should trust him" Racism 100 percent
Omg yes
Blue: "I think I accidentally killed red..." All: lets just ignore that... Also all: "let's vote white"
"What if I'm the impostor and I just dont know...?.." - blue 2020 😂😂😂
2:35 that voice crack tho LOL “your gonna vote cYaN alright” XD
Somebody get blue a Harvard scholarship
Iam 12 years old may I be in your Among us reality shows and just to know Yellow and Lime are feeling left out so can I be yellow and an Impostor have you made impostors win yet?
Blue has been the reason they won both times
When white was like “f**k you and your stupid medbakdjduhdhsjjs” I was dying😂
Blue saved us!!!!!!    Again
6:10 Is it Ghost from Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2?

GOD DAMMIT HE IS CALLED "PURPLE GUY".  THATS ALREADY SUS ENOUGH
😡😡😡😡😡 It was purple☹️☹️☹️☹️☹️ but I love purple
This one is so amazing! I love Purple's caracter, the continuation of White's, Black's, Red's, Orange's and, obviously, Blue's! It's so sad that the only girl of the groupe is the first one to be ejected (impostor or not) but I really loved it! Really good job ^^
2:05 Hey hey hey YouTube calm down that was fake gun 😂
Purple sounds like the guy from cod
yall dont realize how many ppl play by purples strat and its so annoying
ARE THEY GONNA IGNORE THE FACT THAT PURPLE PULLED A GUN OUT AT WHITE
Blue can’t be imposter he can’t fit in the vent.  Sorry blue
I like your cut g 😂😂😂😂
Pls,make a subtitles
my fav is cyan
2:50 purpul sous like a lot of sus (10 sec later or not
Is it only me or is blue my favorite 😂 (I like the other colors too but blue just speaks to me)
Yes blue is Dumb 😂😂😂
These are so good! I need more. Moooore. MOOOOREEE.   Awesome work! Imagine if they do the ghosts too.
6:43 omg purple lmao

Best Among Us Content ever

Purple: im the man behind the slaugther Other ones:ok lets vote black
First episode I laughed 😂 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

All the hard decision is up to blue lol
Black: He's British and that's sus. Tan France: SAY THAT TO THE ZIPPER WHICH WAS ZIP UP YOUR THROAT :3
Bro blue grunting was so annoying
MAKE A THREE also dirt
ok time to make another joke Blue last time: I think it’s always red  *hears red says he’s imposter and votes white* Blue this time: I think it’s me now *votes himself* At the ending:  Blue: hmm should I vote myself or vote purple *votes purple*
Blue is always the dumbest one he should have the dum on him
The way the the emergency button was beef from a McDonald’s and spray painted them red
Guys you so good pls do episode 3 plssss
I was expecting purple to start telling black about his plan to kill Homelander
Did red have a bloody nose @ 4:06
Purple acting was awesome!!
I loooove red and black
Purp: kill green but cyan voted out for nothing  Yeah, cyan was me but only different color. I just chilling in the map, havent kill or venting but magically a crew say he see me kill the body like bruhhh, i dont even know where is the body and voted out for zero reason.
Blue always come in clutch at the end😂
Bruh purple sounds a lil like captain price from Call of Duty 🤣
Bear Grilz in amoug us
I hate reality tv shows
purple sounds so much like Steve irwin ): rest in peace
5:59 the turkey sound he made sent me XD
Blue allways has the last word
Love this video. Any chance someone can sub my account thing? I'll do yours back. Planning a bicycle ride across the country and want to post it on YouTube and get views so i can get sponsors for bike trips all over. Ride my bike from Florida to Washington State. Camping and all sorts of crazy fun stuff. Make videos and get sponsors for a trip back or hop freight trains on the way back east. Just clicking one button could really set me up.  Nothing crazy on my page now  Just videos of my dogs and travels. No ads or anything silly. Some hockey and the  mountains. My garden and Tampa Florida stuff. Please and thanks.
I don't know mannn, blue is kinda sus to me.
Why is the floor wet around ohhhh.
The thing is that this is painfully accurate
Why has the final vote always have to be in the hands of the Blue.  I'm always like "CMOON MAAN, YOU CAN DO IT"
imagine going to get something out of storage and seeing the power rangers discuss a murderer on the loose
Personally, I don't think the vacuum of space kills impostors.  I don't think they need to breathe, like Frieza.  That's why they win when oxygen runs out.  They survive reactor melting down because they're resistant to radiation.  The 'ghosts' is simply a game play aspect... or maybe it's their Stands, ala Jojo's.
but among us is a really fun and hilaoruos game this game is addicting
i seriouly did think that it was cyan
YouTube rewind again
Why does purple look like Chris from @Mrbeast
Its purple
Please make some show 3 and 4
How is Blue always the one that somehow makes the right choice to win them the game?!
How did they get price in this what
i like blue🤣🤣🤣🤣
why is nobody talking about the voice crack at 02:32
Yea
9:23 Finnish peopole in nutshell

Blue is best ♥️
Purple be sounding like captain price.
pov: you wanted to see the comments without any spoliers
i LOVE the wet floor sign~~ my go to~~~ i also love how purple has the fedora, its too perfect
Why does purple's accent sound like billy butcher from the boys
I love how Blue makes the right choice at the end
2:36 that voice crack tho
okay why did he sound like captain price for like 2 seconds
why do purple sound like csgo modern SAS agent
Blue is everytime the game changer
You should do next one with blue is the killer I’ll be so funny
Bruh yall just vote prurple😂😂..he already got a GUN ON HIS HANDS!?!?😂😂😂😂😂
R E D  S U S  \
I wanted to see a snapped neck
The man behind the slaughter...
Cyan: i saw blue vent Everyone: ok     *Red was not The Impostor*
Purple sounds like Bucher  from the boys
If you guys make another among us video, can you please put mini cremates in there plssssssss. And can you make the imposter kill someone when kills someone with his mouth and stabs them
so much work for a big big big great thing
I think that he was goin to vote him self 😂
I think it was dark green
from red to himself
SO good another one
Red sus
I literally love blue.
*Deflecting* was red's reason to vote cyan lol lol also i loved how purple said I LIKE UR CUT G then runs away XD
I recognized the take on Billy Butcher right away and it made things so much better
This is awesome but can you next time not reveal the impostor right away

How did you get the bone after somebody dies

One day an Irishman, who has been stranded on a desert island for over ten long years, sees an unusual speck on the horizon.  “It’s certainly not a ship…” he thinks to himself. As the speck gets closer and closer, he begins to rule out the possibilities of a small boat, then even a raft.  Suddenly, emerging from the surf comes a drop dead gorgeous blonde woman wearing a wet suit and scuba gear.  She approaches the stunned man and says to him, “Tell me how long has it been since you’ve had a cigarette?”  “Ten years,” replies the Irishman.  With that, she reaches over and unzips a waterproof pocket on her left sleeve and pulls out a pack of fresh cigarettes. He takes one, lights it, takes a long drag and says, “Faith and begorrah! Is that good!”  “And how long has it been since you’ve had a sip of good Irish Whiskey?” she asks him.  Trembling, the castaway replies, “Ten years.”  She reaches over, unzips her right sleeve, pulls out a flask and hands it to him. He opens the flask, takes a long swig and says, “This is absolutely fantastic!”  At this point she starts slowly unzipping the long zipper that runs down the front of her wet suit, looks at the man and asks, “And how long has it been since you’ve played around?”  With tears in his eyes, the man falls to his knees and sobs, “Oh, Sweet Jesus! Don’t tell me you’ve got golf clubs in there too.”   If you enjoy the comment plz do “savscribe”to my channel...., I know I had written wrong spelling and grammar 🤗 But YouTube don't allow promotion... Please guys help me gain suvscribers 😞🙄🙄
i like ya cut g
once i was like purple and did literally what he had done- ratting the other imposter to gain trust
BLUE IS THE MVP!!
I love these

Davie504: The hardest choises requiers the stronggest wills Everyon in meeting room: yup

One thing: Why does blue survived till the end and gets to decide from the last two that one of them is an Imposter But you guys got 5⭐rating from me
Why is green is first killed in there
Red: Always sus and no - tasker  Black: Gangster that always vIbEs aT wIrEs and knows best Green: The person that no one notices  Cyan: The person who is accused last but is voted of anyway White: Always accusing orange Orange: Always accusing White Purple: British Genius and quoted  every interview  Blue: Dumb mastermind and genius idiot
Yay the sequel

0:00
11:03
*RED SUS!!!*
I love how it's always down to blue, and he just is so confused and eventually votes out the correct person.
blue is 10000iq for sure
2:36 That voice crack tho
Blue is actually the smartest Crewmate he has this strategy where he is the only one that votes someone that nobody voted for then if the impostor tries to make him vote the person he does the opposite he is a genius.
Blue is wholesome
What about making 'the spirit' also....
Who else is this show making them mad
Purple sounds like my Saint Row 3 and 4 Character. I love that voice
Guys you have to check the gain of the mic..
oh yep among us
Blue do be clutching up though
Orange has a stem on his head
Salvation is a free gift. When you believed you were sealed until the day of redemption.  Jesus died for our sins on the cross , was buried , and rose again on the third day and because of this you are saved.
Why is it the useless one get survive in the end?😂
Blue is an idiot he thinks he is the imposter
Guys make a different story
tip: dont buffer the voices so much, its hard to hear them
Me: I play like Purple  Also Me: I'm totally Blue
Can we just talk about blue being the biggest clutcher
Blue will always be my fav😂
i miss pink!!  hope the whole squad can come out next thank you for this series!!
red: said sounds like blackpink 3:36 but i thought he said that but its deflecting i heart it properly😅

Lol he said before killing black I like your cut g
Blue is Dorkshaddow xdd
4:05 Its been to long...
@Netflix take notes
You probably know the feeling, you are at a bar or a party and hit up a conversation with a really cute chick, and you think, "Isn't she flirting a bit with me?" And yes, she is. You think, "Yes! It's on, boys!" Sex is in the air, but when you get home to her place she says, "It's just, I have to get up really early," or "It's because I'm in kind of a confusing period, Sten."
this is great! 😂
Yeeeees
Blue:imposter  Meeting:blue:its RED
I like how purple killed green and accused his own teammate
Do num 3!
PURPLE had a gun

Purple: I Like ya cut, G! Black: Wait what- Purple: *Punches his palm and ready to kill* Black: Woah!- *Taco Bell Intensifies*  In 6:43

Niice
red is so handsomee
When ever they sit in the chair and like talk to the camara, if you look into they're helmet you can see the whole crew LOL please dont change this xD
Make more videos of among us in real life
Actully the crewmates are the bad guys are the imposter is the good guy, 'Why?' May you ask?, Because sloth Mentioned in the desc the imposter was an alien, Which explains the sharp tongue that comes out of his Mouth when he or she kills you, And also explains the lab map and they aren't doing this for fun they're trying to Wipe they're whole species, So the imposters are trying to stop them so the next time your imposter Remember your doing this for your people, So the crewmates are evil and the imposters are good.
blue is every public lobby
I was literally shouting “NoOoOoo!” When Red died
definitely simping for red
Make one episode where Impostor wins
Blue:   R E D   I S   S U S Also Blue: Votes purple

This is the Most Important post you will ever read;  Every one of us has broken God’s moral law, the Ten Commandments. We’ve all lied and we’ve all stolen, which makes us liars & thieves; And James 2 : 10 states that breaking even just one of these commandments makes us guilty of breaking them all.   The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because The Creator is perfect in holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in justice, meaning not a single sin will go unpunished; and our penalty for sin is death & hell, which the Bible describes as Eternal fire where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. Here, he lived a perfect & sinless life, only to take the punishment that we deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, & endured a painful death on a cross for our sake. Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. On the third day, he conquered death & rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of Gods judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace;  Except a gift can either be accepted or rejected..So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, & through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old ways. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, & the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9), and you will be saved.  The moment you do this, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds pleasure in sin, & also, he will grant you eternal life in his presence; Nothing on this earth even close to compares to what awaits believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY.. meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make. And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ is awaiting YOU right this very moment; don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you have surrendered to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. and as it is written  (Hebrews 9 : 27); ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.  All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ.  https://www.amazon.com/dp/1432117750/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_KttEFbESFBVEC

I am disabled ...   Not by birth .... I was also a person who had done a good job .... I was disabled in a car accident that was inflicted on me by a cruel man in 2019 .... He crashed me and fled .... I still can't find that person today  To anyone ....   I lost my job too ... because I don't like begging people ..... this is how YouTube tries to be my source of income ... if you can watch my videos, subscribe and support me ....   Thank you so much ... !!!!!
Purple: I like your cut g
White got me laughing at 5:58
I didn't like blue. I wish purple hit the button and said blue did and he saw him there
Yes I’ve been waiting for this
Make 1 Imposter win
06:10 familiar call of duty voices
idiot its purple
The fact that everybody saw purple kill and then purple blamed cyan. The fact that they believe him is so true. Games really be like that tho
Blue is my fav color
Anyone heard purple’s voice crack at 2:34
That Call of Duty quote.  Purple: Don't worry we'll get em next time.   😂😂😂
*When I'm imposter* Expectation: *Purple*  Reality: *Blue*
Guys I think it's me😹😹😹😹?
They actually did this these people are amazing👍
If they don’t make this into a series I’m sabotaging their comms and constantly calling emergency meetings so no one can do any tasks
God I  love blue XD
Someone should actually make a place where you can do among us irl with people or like rent it for birthday parties
They should keep on making series
Purple sounds like gideon from cod advance warfare
Is purple trying to sound like Billy Butcher
I need to see one video where the imposter wins, and is important that blue were the imposter
is it me or they the only one's who  in real life among us vids not cringy
Diabolical
I need this in life
More parts Needed
I love how green always dies first
Part 3!
You should make on the ghost perspective
Orange is always best color
It’s like red vs. blue but among us . . .    Finally this year so kinda good
How is blue always coming through in the end?
Purple sounds like captainpice
Purple:I like your cut G Black:HUH? blue:ehhhhhh.......ehhhhhhhhhhh...........ehhhhhhhhhhh
Never trust the "purple guy," that's how Fnaf started xD

Can you make a third one🤗
Well, I always play blue, but I'm not that stupid
YAY THE SEQUEL
LMAOOO 2:34 GOT ME- 💀💀
Blue: what if... I’m sus?
When purples said I like ya cut g I lost it
Yes we needed more of this
9:22-9:26 when you and your math partner get all the answers right
Imagine Blue voted for Orange but they still won by finishing their tasks.
The guys who says “wait a minute,I think that’s meh” survives everytime.😂😂😂
I like ya cut G!😂😂😂😂😂
Blue is the best XD
Make blue & orange the imposter
Can we please have blue as an imposter in the next part?

6:11 cod moment don’t worry we’ll get him next time
I think it’s red
wow 😄
P.i.p green
Haha PurpleGuy, a classic murderer name
I like ya cut g-
PURLPLE
It would be great to do a part 3 where Blue is the impostor, and he wins because everyone ignores him when he says it's him.
Love it do more
Next on mira HQ
The gun
i think its purple but why  we see it killed green  what ever
So it's pronounced syan not cyan :O          Wow I'm an idiot '-'
TwT anyone who watches South Park will get this comment: Blue is Cartman and Red is Kyle- it’s hilarious
The director HAD to have played with me before. Orange is soooooo accurate I'm always paying attention to the tiniest details and my evidence is lengthy for who the imposter is,  78% accuracy
Everyone ends up voting cyan the end
5:54 me win I sea my girl
Blue Guy: *It's me* Purple Guy: Its blue Orange: *It's the man behind the slaughter*
I like how blue is the 3rd imposter
poor green... always killed so quickly  also can you please have yellow join next time
Y pa cuando el 3 esto esta bien chido
Now there’s going to be videos on tiktok
Perpol sounds like right hand man
This is so funny
Red still has the cowboy hat
Where can I find a helmet like that? Please!
Is it me or did I hear Captain Price when purple said "we'll get them next time"
How are they not at a million subs
https://youtu.be/IWjPoAo6YMw
Yall have to have blue be imposter and have it come down to blue red and someone else and have reds heart break when he figures out its blue
Blue is always stupid
Red vs blue vibes if you know you know
its purple and Cyan
I just noticed that Green is the first one to die like the other one
Captain price was the imposter?!?!?!?
So true though
Does anyone else realize that purple low key sounds like Jason statham
aye ik this be annoying as hell but ik i got potential, and if you could check out my new single i’m still strapped, it’d help out a lot, and if you fw it then play it to your friends and get the word out there. if not it’s straight lmao but regardless what u do have a good day.

Someone might have already asked but where did you guys buy the outfits and helmets if you don't mind?
No one: Me: The vent in Medbay doesn’t go to reactor...
nice to know
Wait are you in a real ship
Where did they get these costumes from? More specifically the helmet
"He is british I don't think we should trust him "  Captain price so you let me no choice to kill you
That's me trying to say Med bay
God bless y’all! The Lord is always by your side no matter what!
Blue is my favorite.
Blue clutched up again
1:23 HOW Did everyone not go  Ohhhh there's a gurllllllllllll

I love Blue and Red's relationship with each other. It's hilarious
This needs to be on netflix no cap
I beg of you to make dark blue an Imposter. Please, I need that in my life.

Mirah hq is trying to wipe out the shape shifting race and the only reason for the aliens to kill everyone is so the shape shifting race can survive........who are the imposters now? 😒
2:35 PIYOK PA
Why did part 1 and 2 end with blue acting dumb
Blue is the dumbest one
Blue is amazing he survived part 1 and part 2
Purple: "I like your cut g" Me: "thx, ur the first to notice"
have they increased in production quality?    The sticky note is better
blue is so dumb XD
origin - among us movie
You guys are really good at making me hate blue more and more through his character progression. Well done
Purple Guy is both representing William Afton from FNAF and Thanos. He even quoted him!
5:55 I thought he was gonna point at blue and say “you cool!”
this is the second time the girl has been voted off first
Blue always coming in clutch
I love how black is actually smart, but talks like an absolute dude.
BE HONEST WHO'S BEEN A FAN FOR A LONG TIME?    “¡ᴍ shouting out ᴇᴠᴇʀʏöꪀᴇ ᴡʜo ꒒ɪᴋᴇꇙ ᴀɴᴅ sᴜʙŞ ᴛᴏ ᴍᴇ”!👽
BE HONEST WHO'S BEEN A FAN FOR A LONG TIME?    “¡ᴍ shouting out ᴇᴠᴇʀʏöꪀᴇ ᴡʜo ꒒ɪᴋᴇꇙ ᴀɴᴅ sᴜʙŞ ᴛᴏ ᴍᴇ”!👽
Purple threw his fellow imposter under the bus 😥
❤️❤️❤️Who wants to hear a voice that relaxes his heart and ends his worries, open my channel❤️❤️❤️.
Purple is legit William afton/ Purple guy he’s a murderer and he’s British
Jolly ol' cut G
I luv blu
Next one someone should have a mini crewmate

Why is Captain Price here lmao
Petition to have blue survive in all future episodes of this series
Purple: 2 imposters        Other people: g uh b th  ygrvhruhr hfgtggtg

Blue's IQ is 1. The only one has three braincells. Speak breath and be with red
I love this
The girl is always voted first!
How is trying to vent as a Crewmate a Task
More of these plz
I love how blue is always in the finale
Fun fact. When a body is reported the name of the location where the body was reported is at the bottom.
Purple: “Don’t worry we’ll get them next time” when they ejected white. Modern Warfare anyone?
Make the imposter win next time
Rip, the Among us backpacks that costs money in the Behind the scenes
Blue, the best crew mate ever.
Part 3
Dirt
I SUScribed
2:32 lmao when he pulled out the gun
Purple: i like ya cut g *slaps*  Black: aaaaaaaaaaAaaaAaaAaa@Aa@Aa
I feel like purple is captain price from cod
The caution wet floor sign 🤣🤣🤣
When purple says I like ya cut g me and my friends say that to each other when one of us is imposter
Im so sad red died he was my favorite lol
Please part three this already popped up so much
Blue:it’s me Everyone:it’s white  blue:ITS ME  *EVERYONE VOTED WHITE* Blue:I give up
I watch part 1 about among us in real life
Who was the other imposter
Purple is CORPES.
Decision back to blue
Didnt the game start with 2 imposters and some how there’s one
What they should do next is, have 3 imposters, 2 being white (from the first one) and purple (from this on), and the other being blue since he is the dumbest. They have to corporate to kill everyone but blue just wants to kill red, in the end blue just rats his team out.
For a million subs
Please
Can you make part 3?
Captain price
The vote always depends on blue
Blue is so funny but purple do have a dat voice doe
I love how as the door closed you heard the taco bell ring lol.
Blue should have the Dum sticker.
Blue just eat
Orange: “Do you wanna hear what I think?” Purple: “No, not really.”    Lol I am so like purple
so this is wht is keeping me sane in quarantine now
Ok I want a part three
i know he was happy to get the "We'll get em next time" line in lmaoo
I need someone to tell me where to find these suits
Fun fact: they never found out that purple actually killed green they still think cyan killed green   edit: thanks for thinking my comment is fun
Blue is always being dumb then in the end he makes the right choice
Nice now dare a lot hahaha
what is the song used in the intro?
I literally love blue.
The man behind the slaughter Purple guy was the imposter
I love how Blue says he accidentally killed red, but everyone just glosses over it. Reminds me of one of Corpse Husband's videos... 🤔
season 3 please🙏
Red sus
finally a part two
blue is me.
“I like your cut g”
the greatest thing about this is that it's naturally socially distant to shoot. masks? we got helmets!!
I like how you can kinda see their faces
Honestly best video 😂
Thanks said and he literally purple
Blue decision save the game.. Yeah.. Go blue!!
Part 3
Why does blue have to be an idiot. Blue is my favorite color. *Looks at self* Maybe I am an idiot...
Purple sounds like capt price

Blue is.....      Always the Hard carry :)
"Wait he's British? We can't trust him!"  Him: Is literally Australian

5:59 WAS THE BEST MOVE
Bruh Orange is the representative of the assholes who tell their mom his brother hit him when he was bothering and hitting his brother first
I hate whoever does that like rats out their teamate

Purple was an imposter  1 imposter remains Orange: 😳
Blue voting for himself is pure gold
Green needs to be the Imposter next because he's always dying
“I like ya cut g”          —Such wise words from Purple
Oh god not this cringy shit

Yessss
I love how blue is literally dumb ™ but miraculously survives lmao
2:30 was so funny
"Like ya cut G"  *(taco bell death sound)*
In public lobbies if a person sees that someone has an accent they say "they have an accent they're not trustworthy." And then the accent person actually gets voted off. This is so accurate
6:43
*Orange Sus*
Chealsa is stupid
Now
Blue saves the day again
What we learned from part 1 and 2 If you stupid like a blue, you will win 🙂
Yayy
Y’all do realize y’all can’t sell among us merch
I love how the "dumb guy" is always the saviour
The end gave me so much anxeity lmaooo
New characters. LOVE IT
Blue is hilarious😂 but I think he ripped his suit🤷‍♂️
This was the best thing i have seen since midnight.. gotta sleep. ^v^

Retality show 3 should be blue imposter
The emergency was a pack of Balone
Nobody:     Literally Nobody:     Not even a single soul:       Blue: eh... eh——- eh... ehhh?  Eh eh....
0:32 what a naruto run
The imposter’s are idiots. Blue keeps voting for the same person until the end. The imposters should know this. The imposters would of won twice if they had just killed blue. And not only that but blue is hilarious. “I think I accidentally killed someone”. Just wow. The imposters think blue is dumb when they are the idiot. Can’t wait for the next one! If there is gonna be a next one. Maybe blue is the imposter next time? What could happen?
Bruh y’all missed the megaphone again.
No one is gonna talk about 5:55?
I want to see the imposter win
omg I love blue🤣🤣
huh
6:44 LOL I like ya cut G XD
Among sus
I held an intense hatred for Orange this entire video.
Blue would be the fantastic impostor, no one would suspect him
Finally orange survived!

Orange - I THINK ITS WHITE! Purple - *ligit holding a gun*
Purple: “You’re dangerous mate. We gotta take care of ya.” Blue: Rethinking his whole life...
The homage to Captain Price with the whole "we'll get em next time" absolutely sent me
Gotta do pt.3
Suggestion : can we get a vid when the imposter wins Plz
He’s British I don’t think we should trust him what is that supposed to mean
https://youtu.be/Z75BDBNS6No

Purple with the voice crack saying Cyan!! 😬😂
6:10 Oh boy the COD Vibes.

Why is capitain Price playing among us?
I love how this is what happens to me every game. It doesn’t even matter if I’m imposter or crew mate, I’m never safe ._.

The blue dude is annoying. Can we vote him off, pun intended?
I think Blue will be the greatest Impostor in the show

Among Us:3Imposter Purple:Imposter Blue: Crewmate Green:Imposter Cyan: Crewmate Orange:Crewmate Black:Crewmate White:Crewmate Pink:Imposter
Lol purple sounds like Henry stickman right hand me
Blue and Red are the best
At the end of the day the decision is always up to blue
Orange: you wanna know what I think:purple: no not really:orange: speaks anyway
4:07 purple guy!!!
Purple: **ejects Cyan** Also Purple: *Thanos quote*
purple is not fair
I love how white just start burbling and his helmet starts to come off a little
Purple + Impostor = The Man behind the slaughter
Were gonna ignore that voice crack?
I can’t stop watching this
when you get voted out but you have no other friends: Well f you, f you, f you and I’ll see you tomorrow
It's funny how orange is literally always fucking stupid and blue never knows what's happening, purples a smart one and cyan doesn't even contribute every time 😂
*Why Black sounds like a rapper*
Do same in among us 3p
I'm sorry little one...   ...  I'm sorry me
The don't worry we'll get em next time  and the I like your cut memes  We're hilarious
Blue is a national treasure
everyone sees purple kill green. also everyone:  yeah it's cyan.
Why is it always up to blue lmao
Lol purple said "I like ur cut g" Black said "wait wut" *dies*
Oranges skin has the same skin as me at among us
I can’t believe they actually threw these guys out in space😨
Salvation is a free gift. When you believed you were sealed until the day of redemption  Jesus died for our sins on the cross , was buried , and rose again on the third day and because of this you are saved
Blue Do be my favorite doe XD
Anyone notice the call of duty preference 'well get em next time'
Purple  just HAD to say i like ya cut g....
I like your cut, G
When its 3 people left, it always ends on blue to vote.
(5:58) MEDBARBRRBRBRBRBRBRBRBRBBRB-

Lmao Captain Price
Black: *vouches for white*  Black 4 seconds after: *VOTES WHITE*

I like the fact the purple is acting like Butcher from the Boys. That pretty DIABOLICAL
Why is black always fixing wires. Lol
Blue is a idiot for sure 100% he’s a idiot

Purple: WHO DID THIS   Purple: it was me
5:58 White's a mood

How to win voting :  *-I saw him vent* *-Black sus* *-he is british, we need to vote him off*
The next imposters should be blue and red lol
Make a part 3 of among us in real life because there’s a 3 imposters
Why when ever black guess the imposter he is always right
"he's British, I don't think we can trust him"
Among us gameplay on my channel!
Is that really the among us space ship
" I think it's meh?!"
Always Stay safe Sending virtual  hugs   Watch my recent for a gift 🎁
Always Stay safe Sending virtual  hugs   Watch my recent for a gift 🎁

The way they act when purple says 2 imposters
Blue:I THINK IT'S MEE!!!!!!

Blue: WhAt If I’m ThE iMpOsTeR aNd I jUsT dOnT kNoW?  Red: that’s not how it works dumbshit
purple threatening to shoot orange  everyone else: “oh no, anyways”
https://youtu.be/DGYJMm6uFSU

Why is the girl always voted out first
Bruh purple literally pulled the gun out and shove it in white face and said to vote cayn then him like bruh
The Real Bros of Sus Valley
Is Purple supposed to be Captain Price of Among us?

Red and blue are funny together
Purple: I’m a survivalist...  So you’re Bear Grylls
I LOVE BLUE

Blue is the “why my name is red” type of player
I'm so happy he said "I like ya cut G"
Blue thinks it's still red

Blue is secretly a genius he votes out the right person last everytime
Blue is the best one 😂😂😂

Did anyone get “The boys” reference?
I miss Pink.
Orange: I think its white. Purple: *legit pointing a gun* Orange: I think I put this puzzle together
Nobody :  Blue: the only one who reports  Who thinks that's sus?
Ypu guys should also put ghosts in the video

https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkCOmkXgVLtLE5i5sxnFu2Q
Vented from nav to caf then med to reactor seems legit
#a mong us in real life
“Wyoming steals Doc’s armor and decides to kill different space idiots”
Can we get 5up to voice act one of these
Red is the best
He's the man behind the slaughter
0:32 black: naruto run to button
https://youtu.be/w7UY9XiNgFQ
Yo blue is the worst player ever
When blue is more stupid than  anyone I know. Life sucks 😂
I enjoy these so much this should be an actual TV show
almost 2 minutes in its purple  I was right
The impostors are cyan and purple that’s my answer
Orange why are you blaiming white purple has a GUN and you think that's not sus orange you are a IDIOT
I'm glad we all have blue to help us with life when were down
Is *blue* ok? 💀💀💀😂
YESS PART 2 :D
the way blue already thought it was himself...purple should've self reported and blue would confess...easy win
"He's British I dont think we should trust him." Literally my friend group playing among us
It's blaming each other when purple did it infront of them at the start for me.....do they need glasses I- 💀
This is awesome.. I really want to be part of the real among us 😲😲
You should make blue imposter next time  Like so they can see ⬇️
Make part 3 4 5 6 7 8
Orange and blue are idoits in this show
I like how pissed purple is when he's thrown out instead of suffocating
Purple be a rogue captain price😂😂
White is me when I get voted off for no reason
I love carrot
If this becomes a full series you got another sub
SUBSCRIBE TO SOMETHING RED PODCAST!!!
Make more i love these
This reminds me of Red v Blue
who wants part 3 of among us reply if you agree with me of having a part three video of among us
Blue always gets it at the end
so true
Only if i had friends , we would play among us in real life
Blue is the smartest person Alive
İts good man
“I like ur cut g.”  Blue: EhhHhHHhh
Blue is my spirit animal 👌🏽
Purple is my favorite with his movie references
Still waiting for the day blue is the imposter.
I like your cut g
I love how dumb blue is he is like soo clueless it’s funny 🤣🤣
Let’s appreciate that orange is a carrot
I Liked White Guy.....Seems Cool
6:47 Taco Bell Ring?
Lol
“I think I killed someone accidentally” - Blue
Can you just make a series of this, I'm addicted already.
Why is blue always the last one alive xD
I🤣 love blue
2:36 That voice crack tho lmao
WE NEED MOREEEEE!!!!
I think the funniest thing with this is that Blue would probably win if he was actually an impostor by virtue of no one taking anything he says seriously. He wouldn't even have to move a finger in a 2 impostor game.
Blue is a true suirvier
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😍😍😍😍
Biggest joke vent of cafeteria  leads to reactor
Do a series of this please!!!
Blue always save the group
Bye 3 y
Blue MVP as always. Watch later on he's going to be an imposter and just destroy the whole crew.

I like how Green allways dies first :)

I think blue and red are amazing
I pray who ever reads this becomes successful, God bless you
YouTube’s getting real comfortable with these no-skip double ads
It s cool to play rhis game like in ESCAPE ROOM
I just want to hit blue in the face
I love the fact that orange is a relatable character because just like orange i'm a loyal cremate, and always does his tasks, and I love how Orange has a leaf hat on top of him so he can be like a carrot.
purple voice crack when he said cyan off 2:36
Among us: The game Netflix adaptation: This video
Эм
If you think about it this is not real among us technically he could kill orange or blue
I love the mw lines
white gets voted  White: well ---- you, and ---- you, and ---- you!  *White was not the imposter*  Im pretty sure that happens alot
P
How come blue is always the person that votes people out but has a suspicion about other people.
I bet Purples name is Captain Price
I love the blue dude 😂
Ornage and dalr blue is the good guy s ever that also friends with eachother well than red 😸
Blue is so dumb
Song at the start?
Blue should have voted orange
0:40 why not running to him? a crewmate would run.
I just noticed how cyan didn’t kill anyone but blue still talking bout her saying “... stayed closer, Like when cyan shot green” 💀💀💀
It   is     purple     think    so
I like how purple literally holds the murder weapon to threaten people to vote cyan
Blue is consistantly my fav
Why that girl always vote out first xD and Blue should start trusting Red🤧
Its called The 100 and it plays on Netflix
Among Us reality show part 3 pleaseeeee ???🥺🥺🥺🥺❤👑👑👑👑
Ummm orange was in O2 but he died how can he speak as a gohst...it says red died but for real orange died..weird.

Omg is incredible!!!🤣
I love how much detail went into this compared to the first one, and I'm looking forward to the next one! Blue is the best, I'm rooting for him. 😂
HOLD UP I PLAY AS CYAN WITH WET FLOOR SIGN ON MY HEAD AND IM A GIRL! my name is DontSlip BUT OML SO CLOSE TO MY CHARACTER!
Blue is good at fooling people so far. The suddenly he is the impostor
Why is black always doing wires?
Blue : I dunno man but red and me sus and it’s probably me
Blue eat peanuts for brain 🧠
I like how it’s always blue that ends up voting the imposter out
Give credits to black for Naruto running in the beginning
Purple sounds like captain price
Hemerald
No pink?
Imagine *Netflix* approved this.
They should make a part 3 but when someone dyes or gets voted off you can see the ghosts
I think episode 3 is gonna have 10/10 people with 3 impostors i love these videos🤩🔥
Blue is too good🤣
Episode 3 pls
Tea with Mr Cheese
💥 Among Us Orginal Song :   Song with lyrics  🎶  : 🎶 https://youtu.be/ldg9ufSJOtw Thank' s Me Leter ❤️😌☝️
We need the imposters to win
Blue should always stay alive in this series
I hope this will be a TV series.
Imagine having players like that in a game 😂
Blue neva dies
Next
We have a British. Not we wait for part 3 and we have a Scottish that swears in every sentence
https://youtu.be/CcbTPuHa0fg
this series is so funny and suspenseful so much better than actual Tv. Please  keep up the good work.  :)
Istg it's sad how much im like blue unironically
This is so cringe bruh
I loved the first one, this is even better
Like pls   ♥️.         ♠️
i like how blue is just the smartest teamate😂
2:03 it definitely pouple
Poor green got killed mostly at the beginning of the game
Here we go again   Black and his wires😶   "Guys I think I accidentally killed red, I think it's me" Everyone: unbothered*  Purple:Imposter will be idiot to kill someone in public Also purple  Kills green in front of everyone  And once again all the pressure on poor blue in end to vote someone out(sigh)
Always at the end of the day blue says the right choice
Purple **Literally holds a gun during the meeting** Also purple : cyans looking sus!
I love blue😂
2:56 turn on subtitles
blue always comes in with the clutch
i knew purple was sus :0
Do 3 inpostors pls😭😭😭
Lol of course the purple dude quotes Thanos lol
This is the best video i have ever watched.. amazing
Blue save the day again
It would be amazing if blue was the imposter in the 3 episode
I miss pink
6:40 I LIKE YA CUT G💯💪🔊🔥👑
meeeee?
This was so well made 👍👍👍
Ok but why is orange always the dumb one ?
I was playing among us and most of the times there would be a blue who votes himself off
Purple skin* Perfect Classic Black Hat* Thanos quotes* Perfect Balanced Strategy* Got killed in the end*  I see what y'all did there...
Purple was not an Imposter. Orange: It wasn't Purple? Blue: Never has been.
In part 3 confirm ejects should be off
Purple Is British Confirmed
PLZ WE NEED MORE OF THESE!!
This looks like power rangers but low budget
We need the irish crewmates here.
the funny part is when it all up to blue and pick the right answer even tho he a dumb idiot { never jugde a book by it cover}
I love these vids keep it up!
I now know why I always choose black. Black makes the best Imposter. And if not Imposter, knows who it is yet no one believes Black, or Black is killed before they could say anything.   Also, ps: Black is usually an expert at card swipe.    Edit: I once won as the Impostor, twice in a row, with two buddies on my ass the whole time lol. Was never suspected or caught. That was very fucking high stress though, oh my gods. 😂
Nice :D
And in real life
Hello I love among us
blue is the hero because of his complete stupidity he saved the day
Lol, blue had a trauma after the first episode
Round 1: blue: I THINK ITS RED round 2: Blue: NOW ITS ME
why did this piss me off
Love the vids
purple murdering green in front of everyone  at the meeting: pulls gun out then blames cyan red:shes deflecting everyone: blaming random person purple: litarally threatening orange orange just randomly picking white lol
Blue is smart all along... And dumb at the same time. 0-0
There’s the shitty intro every reality show needs
Pls make this a real series pls....
I now blue is smart!
Someone pls kill the blue he looks suffering the whole time
Red:(pointing at cyan) oh no.. she's (cyan) deflecting while looking at blue  Blue: RED SUS

I can relate to orange so much. I'm almost always a crewmate, just doing my tasks, not bothering anyone. But if someone will go in the same room with me or will just stay somewhere  m e n a c i n g l y  I'm gonna insta sus them, but if they end up yeeted off after all, they're almost never an impostor  :')

Another one but other maps........
Blue is funniest
Was it just me or did purple saying " we'll get em next time" remind you of captain price when you fail a spec ops mission in modern warfare 2 and 3
Voting out the other impostor  Rawknee gang
Blue has the best win rate so far... let that sink in
I love how no one is questioning y tho
Blue: ehhh, I think its red Red: you motherfu- *Red was not the imposter*
Blue is the game changer
Bruh there’s no way that there’s no tv there bro

Purple sounding exactly like Butch from The Boys 😂😂😂
Blue: i think it's red (always)
Sign of Impostors: (this isn’t always the case) Over-talking Under-talking Unfollowing ppl Goes to security 1st Always reports Doesn’t report Always blames Waits for the green bar to up before leaving Doesn’t get shocked about deaths Blending in Following u in security Going at medbay Tries to blend by saying “where” (Tell me more in comments)
This is so fun and creative
Dude I'm confused when orange was fixing the wires purple killed him how is he still alive in the emergency meeting
We need a Halloween special edition.
Orange: *dies* Also orange: *stays in the game*
i like how purple says "i like your cut g"
Blue: dumb but be a hero Me when play as blue: smart but always be killed first
Blue in episode 1:its red blue in episode 2: i think its me
This one was a little over the top
I love it 🥰
The Man Behind The Slaughter.

I love how blue always has something with red and then thinks it’s himself if red dies but then votes off the imposter  “He’s British he sus” “Agreed” *points gun* “SHUT THE F UP ORANGE “
Blacks always the first to see something The girl always gets voted first Blue always makes the last and impactful decision
Wait- wheres punk is she dead
Anyone else think purple sounds like captain price??
Make a third one
This should be a real show
The man behind the murder
It always comes down to blue making the final decision.
9:25 am i the only one Who screams “CoRoNa!!~~”?
blue and red are such a duo😭
Blue is a god
Purple literally sounds like Price from MW. Anyone else get those vibe
"Trust me guys it's yellow I saw her vent"
Red: ohh she's deflecting...  Blue: oh no red susss  Red: *anime stare*
85% of Blue's lines are "euh..."
blue good job you think this because  you wanna get out of this game
For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in our Lord Jesus Christ
Woooowwwwww   joylavita.com

Purple sounds like Batman.
6:10 *activates captain price mom mode*
😈😱😳👽😠👾💩😵 #purple and green
Purple is the imposter because his the man behind the slaughter, hey that rhymes. **Five Night's At Freddy's intensifies**
不是可以给小小猫猫的时候我问。
We are ghost
"It's good to see that 'Blue' always is the one who makes the team win the game." *always*
"You know what. Here's what were gonna do. You're gonna vote *CYAN* off"                                                                                 Purple,           The Real Impostors of Among Us.

I love the fact that blue voted red The whole time *reality show* And now he votes himself XD *reality show 2*

everyone’s so dumb, no ones gonna talk about “the british guy” being cpt. price
Purple: I am detective, but then Impostor Cyan: I'm girly Impostor, I'm innocent Red: I hate you blue Black: idk man, u kinda sus Orange: Y E S blue: *I think it's me* White: U IDIOTS I was not the Impostor Green: guys I was first to die
PURPLE KILLED GREEN RIGHT IN FRONT OF EVERYONE!!! I didn’t expect Cyan to also be an imposter but PURPLE!!!
Purple is what American people think British people sound like.

that british accent was horrible
0:08 was it perhaps the excess electricity that you felt?
who else noticed that orange was the one who died but still apeared
Why is among us so popular? 😂
“I think it’s meeehhhhhh”
No one:     Literally no one:    Blue: I think it's me
What if blue just keeps getting dumber every episode until he can barely even talk.
BLUE IS FUNNY

https://youtu.be/lYaFQARN3PI
The blue guy is literally dorkshadow lmao
Purple sounds like CORPSE and play style
The sequel we didn't know we wanted  But we needed
Oh ok
Imagine someone turns Among Us into an Anime
Blue is definitely my favorite
The funny thing is, I play the way purple does
Blue: I think its me
Lol I would love to be in this reality show if it was real
Wait a minute that’s re... I mean I think it’s me
Part 3 pls🥰
There has to be another one but with 3 inposters
*y o p u r p l e s u s*
Can you please make a part 3
This is Cinema - Martin Scorsese
I see they did some adult humor also. The female character has a Caution Wet Floor😂
Why do the females gotta get voted of first
*Among Us was filmed in front of an live studio audience*
YES
Part 3 pls
How does he have a gun
The Billy Butcher impression by purple works great 👍
Ok
Respect to blue Blue is our savior Win without brain Vote impostor
i noticed that ther oxygyn tanks are backpacks
Sounds like butcher from the boys
No one:  Blue: I think it's me
Blue😂😂😂😂
Is was Red
i love these videos pls do more <3
Next time, kill Blue first because him so fucking lucky
6:43 Billy Butcher once he finds out Homelanders Weakness
Wow I am really enjoying these please make more episodes
LOL
Just realised there’s no lime
Kick blue
It's all fun and games till he said, "I like ya cut G"
Wow
Blue is the best.
Lol blue is funny
blue is my spirit animal
Yes this is the best among us in real life
He is British we cant trust him
This  feels like what would happen in the future
2:35  You're gonna vote cYAn off
Blue -_-
2:01 stack kills be like:
At the end of the day, nobody dies. They just-  Materialize onto the chair.
What "Stack Killing" looks like in real life:        Introducing meme here: Purple: *gunshots* Also Purple: Who could have done this?
Purple: **pulls out his guns and kills green in front of everyone** Everyone: **yeah we are all color blind we didn't see what happened**
Missed it
*British guy tryna be Cpt. Price?*
This is such a good idea
Come to my channel, an instructional video about Minecraft
The rare "get them to vote of your own teammate"
Lol at first I thought it was blue and red
I hope whoever reads this knows, yes you’re a lazy person, and instead of studying or doing something productive, you’re watching this.
Gyse can we friends
Vaulate was a empostor
I THINK BLUE IS ME 😂
Imagine being this bored to make an among us game in to irl dumbasses
Blue is making me lose brain cells Then again I would like to see blue as an impostor
Blue is too funny
"I like ya cut G" "*taco bell bell goes off*"  This is golden.
My god thanks I needed this
This is #4 on trending. I just want to point that out.
Blue is now my favorite character
This gives me red vs blue vibes. I love it.
Okay but that's kinda *sus*
I wonder how green and cyan were seeing the surrounding putting the warning and dum poster on the helmet.
Blue always pulls through
Blue is the kid in school who eats glue.
Blue is literally the most dope character
Why does purple sound like captain price
Press X to Doubt The Inposter Lol
That’s always the worst idea in a two impostor game “Vote him, if it’s not him vote me” That’s an easy way to get suspicion off of you if you’re throwing away your teammate And you can act as suspicious as you want and no one will care         This is why I play with one impostor, because I’m too scared of this
Its captain price
4:12 I love how it’s said by purple
I thought this was corn for a sec 🍼💦
Did purple really said I like yuh gut g on 4:44
I hope it is not based on "real events"
Nobody: Me: *purple guy except it’s in among us?*
No not me 😐
Red and Blue’s dynamic is this show is absolute gold.
This should be an actual show
6:08 got me fucking laughing and btw it’s from Cod if u guys didn’t know 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Bro could you make one where the imposter actually wins not just almost wins then the blue guy just somehow becomes Sherlock homes and gets the imposter out every time
In one video: *blue is always voting red* Now:blue is voting him self
why do us girls get voted out 1st?? I mean I'm happy that she was the imposter but why girls 1st??
"Purple I lost my earing"  "PEOPLE ARE DYING CYAN"
Those hats 😂😂
Finally come out
I love orange
2:34 purple voice cracks
Blue is so stupid
Orange is dumber than blue
my screen actually stopped when he said Now hold on wait a minute wait a minute like wtf
Purple is the imposter
He has an Australian accent but whatever

This is so true, people just blaming each other wihout thinking
It's all fun and games till blue gets imposter
Littery red mad sus
Thinking about reviewing this for my youtube channel 🤣🤣🤯😜
Eat your cereal
Nobody:  Purple: 6:40 I lik ya cut g

Blue clutched it again XD
BRUH STOP ITS BLUE LISEN WHAT HE SAID

Purple is that character in every call of duty game who tells you how to play.
Lol he is doing the naruto run
Soooooo, we gonna ignore that Purple is Captain Price?
1:22 I will find him I will capture him and no one will die again!
Just the fact that purple pointed a gun at someone and says it's cyan and no one cared about the gun just says that this is literal among us logic
bro these people must have played a game then saved the chat log LMAOO Too good XD
I want your pc bro, *where can I come to steal it?*
Oh ye here we are again!
The Man Behind The Slaughter: British Edition

I don’t know about you guys but I think this might be a reality show
The fact that I hate Orange  for blaming  White  as an imposter every time someone dies.😂
LOL IF BLUE WAS SO SMARY
Is no one going to acknowledge the Naruto run black did at the beginning
how does blue always survive lol

Dear friends, when Father God calls, we need to answer! Adam and Eve were used to hearing God’s voice in the garden. However, after they disobeyed Him by eating the forbidden fruit, they hid from Him when they heard Him calling, “Where are you?” (Gen. 3:9). They didn’t want to face God because they knew they had done something wrong—something He had told them not to do (v. 11). When God called for Adam and Eve and found them in the garden, His words did include correction and consequence (vv. 13–19). But God also showed them kindness and gave them hope for mankind in the promise of the Savior (v. 15).                                   God doesn’t have to look for us. He knows where we are and what we are trying to hide. But as a loving Father, He wants to speak to our hearts and bring us forgiveness and restoration. He longs for us to hear His voice—and to listen.                                Precious one, open your ears and heart to our Creator right now by first understanding that you are a sinner in need of our Savior. Welcome Abba Yahweh (Father God) through Yeshua (Jesus the Christ) into your life. Confess with your mouth and believe in your heart that Jesus is Lord of your life. Receive grace by believing in Jesus Christ and what He did on the cross, His death, burial and resurrection for the sins of all mankind. You will then be justified in salvation and forever blessed with His abundant love by the Holy Spirit!                                            Let us pray!......Thank You so much Father God for Your love and care. Thank You for sending Your Son, our Savior, to fulfill Your promise of forgiveness and restoration. May we always be open to hear Your call and answer immediately. This we pray in Your Mighty name, Amen! May God bless you in the Glorious name of Jesus Christ our Lord and our Savior.❤️❤️❤️
blue is so stupid lmao

“He’s British, I don’t think we should trust him” that made me laugh so hard
A British saying diabolical? Mmm
Something else for you. If you die today will you go to heaven? Have you ever lied, stolen, used God's name as a curse word (O-M-G)? According to God's law, you're guilty, your headed for hell, ignorance will not be an excuse... But wait, God loves you, he made a way out for you, God's son Jesus died paying for your sin.  God so loved the world that he gave his only son that whoever believes in him will not die but have everlasting life. John 3:16   God is warning the world. End Time prophesies are jumping off the pages of the Bible, plagues, violence, scoffers, government control, earthquakes, fires, floods, people will be lovers of themselves, money, lovers of pleasure rather than God, evil will be called good and good called evil, sexual immorality rampant adultery, fornication, abuse... the ultimate in child abuse mommies killing their babies in child sacrifice (abortion), World leaders are prepping for a One-World order, government, religion (please don’t take a number on your forehead or right hand, read Revelation a number means no heaven, and there's only one alternative) The government is also prepping to have you believe that UFO's are real... Soon the antichrist will come and fix everything, everyone will love him, he will deceive many... then the tribulation will start, life on earth will be horrific. Today if you hear God whispering to your heart please respond before it's too late. Say a humble prayer, pour your heart out to God, he loves you, open your heart take a chance receive Jesus as your savior.
Blue is funny lol.
I love how it always comes down to blue's vote

These guys are dumb, purple is literally holding a gun and threatening white and they don’t think it’s purple 2:24
Roast me
Wait did they found all impostors or only one impostor
"where gonna vote CYAON off"
there is so much bass at the beginning and it is making my subwoofer shake my whole room lol.
Purple saying WE’LL GET EM NEXT TIME sounds like price from cod
This hurts me so much .. i-
The end is no longer near; the end is now HERE!  Tomorrow may be too late for you; no one is guaranteed tomorrow. We are all sinners and the wages of sin is eternal death in hell! REPENT and ACCEPT JESUS CHRIST as your saviour today in 3 simple steps.  A - Accept that you are a sinner in need of a saviour B - Believe in your heart that Jesus Christ was born of a virgin, died and shed his blood for our sins, buried, resurrected on the third day, ascended to heaven and is seated at the right hand of God C - Confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is lord of your life.

JESUS IS COMING!! Repent!  https://youtu.be/IrA2hPL23fs
“He’s a British, we can’t trust him”  From personal experience of being a former British... yeah that sounds accurate

blue is dumb
Blue and red are always together but they hate each other 😂😂😂
ВИ ТУПЕЗДИ  ЕТА ФЕАЛЕТАВИЙ!!!
Omg
No c ke dicen pero suena interesante :D
this is so cringe jesus christ just making this to get views off the hype of this great game, so cringe that its being ruined by retarded cosplayers who think theyre funny
Purple pretended to not be imposter by voting his teammate out, but at what cost
Purple: *pulls out gun* STFU
It is purple
Yeah
For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life. ‭‭John‬ ‭3: 16‬   that if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved; ‭‭Romans‬ ‭10:9‬ ‭  Everyone needs help when they are going through tough times and when they are happy. Jesus is universally needed. This world is full of problems and tries to destroy/prevent faith in Jesus. Jesus is the way and we all need Jesus, especially during this time. We need to read His Word, which is the Bible and to join a church.
I started to laught when blue vot his self
This reminds me of a time when I was the imposter. I hadn’t killed anyone and the game had only been going on for like 2 minutes before someone pressed the emergency button and said I vented... I didn’t vent though.
Lol
Crowd kills are even more weird irl than in the game lol. How did they not know it was purple when it happened lol......
GUYS İT'S TAPE THAT I TOOK FROM PEWDİE'S LİVE STREAM LOOK CLOSELY THROUGH MİRROR STANDİNG BEHİND AT 4:21 https://shrinke.me/ftLwQ
0:46 Me as an Irishman lmao
ha now you have funny hats
Netflixpayattention
Don’t change blue
One of these days, Blue will be impostor and nobody will even suspect him.
I am so proud that my Main is blue
No sé inglés 😔
Make episode 5 plz
Im red
The blue guy is useless and stupid part one he voted red for no reasons and now he think its him.
I couldnt stop laughing at 5:57
Red still kinda sus tho
Purple is Billy Butcher lol
Blues the best lol
I didnt know i was blue once and voted myself LOL
Nobody:  Purple: I like your cut, g.
Saying Purples British we can’t trust him is a racist thing to say
Is this real
HES BRITISH
Why am I here? I have a test tomorrow, I should be studying, I don't even know what it is about
*Desde donde vez este vídeo* _Like: celular o tablet_ _Comenta: computadora_ _Dios bendiga a mi próximo suscriptor ❤🇪🇨🙏_
Blue:*calls an emergency meeting*.everyone:votes blue accept blue&red. Blue was the imposter. 😂
I thaought it was orange
Purple sounds like he's doing a Karl Urban impression.
Who else wants to see Blue as imposter next episode?   Just me..ok-
Make part 3 blue always skipping
Who want part 3?
I love it can you make anohter one sorry If you don,t insertand me I'm not inglish I'm spanish
I want reality show 3
These are hilarious I need more
(ง'̀-'́)ง
Blue with the clutch again
Blue votes  red the hole game.    White:heheheh easy pease
This will come and go just like every fad
I fuxking love this. Keep this going for sure ! Sadly very accurate
Yikes the voice crack at 2:36
Blue is definitely faking idiocy, how else does he always survive and vote the right person. In reality he is the most 5head one among them just doesn’t want to seem like a threat
Make more
BLUE WILL NEVER DIE!
lol
Yes please but without cussing please 😭
Hi
Purple is sus.  When your the imposter you gotta ride these crewmates like  a bull fighter.
please make this a series i love them!!
omg what kind of among us logic i this lol
era o rocho
Blue is the best character here 😂 @Laugh Over Life, you guys definitely should do next part with flashlights, no electricity, zero visibility and maybe adding double kills ? 😄
Why is green always first to die
Imposters are aliens. remember that. the reason they sabotage o2 is to kill the crew, and not them. they're aliens, alright?
Absolutely loving the The Boys and COD:MW references!
Purple: *pulls out a firearm in emergency meeting* Most crew mates: cyan sus
Ok this is triggering because nobody in this game has logic
I fricking love this !!!! It’s sooo good !!
Purple:kills someone Infront of everyone Nobody: purple sus
Everything about this frustrates me
Plsss third part
WE NEED A PART 3 OMGG
5:51 Gordon Ramsay be like
Blue gives me Bill and Ted vibes
Tbh, I've seen worse obvious and painful to watch Games get won.    ...I should know, I was the imposter, and pubs are dumber than door knobs. XD
Always goes down to blue...
Want to know what’s far worse than 2 Imposters? 3 Imposters!
More vids keep up the good work
White is my spirit space suit 👨‍🚀
I hate blue so much 😂
Dude my Among Us character looks exactly like red
“Only one person who likes this will one day be a billionaire” “Good Luck” 🍀
Ha he did the I like your cut g thing
Among us on E!
White trying and failing to flip the table is a total mood
never stop this
3 imposters probably in part 3
In case no one told you today👀👇🏽👇🏽👇🏽:  You’re beautiful🙂.  You’re loved💕.  You’re needed🤗.  You're amazing😁.  You’re stronger than you think💪🏼.  Never give up on your dreams🙌!  Please show some love 💕to a small channel 👀👍🏼🙂
What do people enjoy about this show? Is it mainly for kids?
How Democrats will Cheat to Steal the 2020 Elections Video: https://youtu.be/biN26peihJs
Im surprised this didn't ruin the game for anyone yet
u
He sounded like captain price
c nas
Why do I keep getting recommendations for Among Us when I haven't searched it up nor give any fucks about this game? I keep saying "do not recommend" but they somehow keep sneaking in videos that I have no desire searching for? How do these recommendations even work?? It seems like it gives you the opposite of what you want to watch. Youtube seriously needs to fix this algorithm because this is driving me fucking crazy! I didn't mind the game at first, but it's being shoved in my face even when I didn't ask for it...now I fucking hate it.
I want part 3 then blue and red are the impostor
Blue is so annoying I think it's me...
Who thinks they should make one that the imposter wins
PURPLE GUY THATS THE DEAL (from fnaf yes lol)
Pls do more of these
Purple was like Sherlock Holmes.
WE NEED A PART 2
I like that the "i like ya cut g" had the taco bell bell sound.
Did anyone realize that you can kind of see the astronaut Helmets
Underrated Moment:   Blue: “What if I’m the Imposter and I just don’t know?!” Red, from the side: “That’s not how it works dumb fuck.”   they are my favorite duo.
Purple sounds so much like captain price brooo
6:11 ....was that a MW2 reference?
Youtube is getting real comfortable with these double unskipable 15 second ads      read my name IF YOU DARE >:)
‌‌‌‌‌                                                            ‌
Make Blue impostor
Nobody:  Blue: "I tHiNk iT's mE"
I love it best show ever. Can you do new arenas and characters as well. I really want episode 3 but 3 Imposters.
I like how purple is the one who gave the thanos quote
Get ready for the "Red was not The Impostor" comments
3.Retro-Spec- Quarantine youtu.be/DLMwiNvTKRk via @YouTube
Purple so sus
Can y’all please rate my music? 💫🥶🙏🏽
Next time show the ghosts too😂
Ending is far too accurate. You do such a good job winning only to be ejected on a hunch by an accuser and an idiot at the very end.
#4 on trending!
Purple: Its cyan Also Purple: Points a gun at whites head in front of everyone during discussion
I want episode 3 plz plz plz  ¦->
Nice
Gg blue and orange
Purple: That doesn't make any sense at all. That would only make sense if you were a complete idiot. Blue: Aww, I get it! (8:29)
Black: He is British, he’s one of the imposter      Yea he’s gon’ conquer the whole ship
hi
cyan has a wet floor sign, we all know what that means
Where the world going tf it’s this , com on
They should have just casted corpse for purple lol

LOL commented under my recent video 🔌
Alternate scene Purple: hold on let me explain- Black: i don't trust purple because he's British! Purple: you racist cunt *Black was not the imposter*
Somehow nobody in this lobby knows that you could skip your vote. And they voted on 7 with 2 imposters
Why is this 2nd on trending
6:43
Vinsamlegast horfa á 5-annað myndband og eins og það ef þú vilt( ég vil að athuga hvernig mörg sjónarmið getur verið safnað á 5-annað myndband): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1q8tjgdxLA
10 on trending, awsome.
Hahaha love it
this shit is so unfunny
It was only a matter of time before Among Us got turned into a TV Show.
Why purple sound like the voice that talks in warzone
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates🎈
This was very entertaining to watch😂
Nice!  https://youtu.be/IgnVYOEYdfo
Who else is here just for the comments lmao...
YouTube really getting comfortable with these double ads and 15 second ads smh...
This comment will tell you something about yourself       You pressed read more
Unpopular opinion: everyone who disliked is absolutely mindless
Blue I swear to god he is our national hero #blueisclutch
In part 3 can you put a link to buy the costhemes
2:34 "youre gonna vote CYAn off"
I like your cut g 👌
YEAASSSSS
I like how cyan keeps saying "It wasn't me!"
I want blue black and red to be next impostors
Part 3 please 🥺
Since red died will he be in the next one?  Red was my favorite character so I’ll be sad if he’s not
Im sorry but i must said this  Its a man behind a slautgher
It's interesting that all the women are getting voted first lol, which is accurate to most games   Meanwhile somehow nobody ever finds me sus and I end up getting away with everything
Blue: I found a body in nav I think I blacked out and accidentally killed him.  Everyone else: keeps voting everyone but blue
Purple sounds like Butcher from The Boys
Blue gonna survive every time
we *need* blue as an imposter
Oi
That one time I blamed someone and used ‘I don’t trust a man who can’t spell’ as a reason and actually guessed right.
I like how it’s always down to blues vote
Is blue the only person who makes 1 choice different?
Black is my favorite 🤣🤣
why did green die first again :(

In episode 3 can you add pink cyan and yellow as the imposter
I think purple is sus 😦😂
I was thinking purple sounds like Cpt. Price and then he said "Don't worry we'll get them next time"
Хехсус где обзор второй части
Did they die in rl?
Is it a school?
https://youtu.be/kRwXBrRrjE8
I still think its black
How does your views not match your subs?
*Dont worry well get em next time
For the next episode you should buy Among Us plushies and act like they're mini crewmates.
it was the man behin the slauter
The rate of production for this was so fast can we just appreciate that?
You just had to say *”purp sus.”*
OK laugh over life can you make a part three among us reality video
Do episode three please
Please make more!!!
You gotta do one of these but with confirm ejects is off!!!
Nah, blue is my fav character.

This video made my day

Smart move on Purple tbh, gonna try that.
*i was in vents*
"he's british, i don't think we can trust him" UK: *The time has come...to take back the Commonwealth!*

Red was imposter 😂😂😂
How did they think about giving white doll hands in the reflection of his helmet
This gives me hard red vs blue vibes
where did you get the astronaut helmet from?
If only everyone was like purple
The naruto run tho
Fantastic
bello
Blue: what if it is me and i just don't know????  Red :That's not how it works blue  Blue: *I SHALL NOT LISTEN TO YOU*
This is why the game sucks
I like how they put hats this time.
Tem gosto de amor q

Red and blue is literally the embodiment of me at the same time Lmfaoo
Thank you
never trust the purple guy
Part 3 pls
Episode 3- 3 imposters Episode 4- the 3rd or 4th imposter Episode 5- The Hacker Episode 6- Black and White/ No name  Ideas just like the actual game
I liked how green is confident on purples plan and praising him, but is the first one killed by purple lmao
I ALWAYS WANTED PART 2
Green is just me, always dies first
Oki but like, Purple kinda sounds like Butcher from The Boys.
Finally ep 2
These are the dumbest crewmates I have ever seen.
Are they dumb because purple kill green
I saw purple spying on me ok. that’s enough evidence for me. Everybody sees purple kill  its cyan.
Made more video fore amougus us pls
6:10  Mission failed, we'll get em next time
I’m British
I want an episode 3
Sounds like Purple has watched a little Disguised toast.
Among us 2 needs to have some kind of IQ test for player registration cause some people in this game have zero brain cells
Some suggestions for among us: Be able to kill the imposter as crewmate, Imposter can kill at emergency meatings, and thats it.
6:43 memelord
“Don’t these people wanna breath ??” 😭😭 mood
I thinks it’s still red.... blue, said.
Dont pressure Blue hes so poor xD
5:59 I bursted out laughing!! 😂
I main purple and I don't know if I like this or not
Ohh yeah part 2 lets go

Blue: Guy's I think its me
Purple
Red allways impostor
i finish this video and i still think is red
Red: Honestly I wish I could vote everybody off of this ship          Me: Me too!
Dont kill the Girl always like in the First Round. I am sorry for her.
Why is this so accurate the idiot of the game is always the deciding vote
Tryna figure out which one is the "smart crewmate that everyone thinks is sus" but as far as I can tell they're all just idiots.
BEEN WAITING ON THISS!!b
How does blue keep surviving till the end
Blue is the best
Why blue always funny
the pieces have landed, the pawns are in place, its time for checkmate. oh god im using that next time i play among us
Petition for them to bring a kid to part 3 as a mini crewmate
Blue always the hero XD
Lol so funny
This is colder than the real Among Us
Out of no were purple kills green. Everyone: :O
White: Say's to purple wait you killed him             Purple: Holds gun to whites head You know what Shut the f*** up your going to vote cyan and then If she's not the imposter then vote me
I love how the British character is portrayed as a mastermind
Blue: *dies by imposter* Wait a minute. I think it's me
It is marvellous!!
They really blew up after this
Black always be viben at the wires
That was great but can you reduce the swearing? It's honestly annoying and it would probably make your videos better
lol
6:42 i like your cut g
Can we get blue to be the imposter pls?
Am I the only person who thinks purple sounds like a combination of Captain. price and ghost
I loose brain cells everytime Blue talks, your laugh will arrive in 25 business days
Blue always coming in clutch
Plz episode 3
I love this. I really want a whole series of this! Super siick

You can’t vent from medbay to reactor, you can only vent to security and elec, only a true among is fan would know that😌
I want an episode 3
Waiting for Infinite to react on this
More make more
“wanna know what I think?” “Not really”
if you pley as orenge you wil be imposter orenge has the hiest chanse of bieing an imposters
Orange is the stereotype you find so often with randoms. I like to call them: The Third Impostor
Honestly I just wish I could vote everyone off this ship 😂 lmfao
Blue is the best
“He’s British, we can’t trust him.”  As a British, can confirm, we are not to be trusted.  Edit: Why did this blow up so much I-
But that was the same exact ending :(
Make a 3 please.
Imagine if Blue was the imposter? He would win easily
red died? *disliked*
That would be a cool mask to wear 💡
Poste more of this stuf
when u gonna make episode 3
Dude, i think it was me...
Orange: OMG WHITE WAS TOO FAST ITS HIM!! Purple: 😏😅🙂
Cyan: has proof purple was the imposter Red: yeah let vote purple Green: purple it is  Blue:  let's vote purple Orange: yeah but black sus   **Black  was not an imposter**
I'd genuinely tune in to watch this
All I'm saying is purple is the narrator  for star wars battlefront 2 classic campaign
Me: *i still sus at purple* Among Us: *Purple was An Impostor.* Game: *Victory*
5:54 was funny no cap white is a good actor
He ran like Naruto .... Naruto run
I still think it's red
In next parts .... Plz show the GHOSTS👻👻 character too ... It would be Hilarious 🤣🤣
Purple littrely has a gun
In the last one i saw blue also won
Don't like it...too much gestures from "black"
when's the next episode ? these should be longer .❤❤💯💯
It is soo funny that he quoted thanos yes he is purple 😂 😂
Blue is so great. If he was actually imposter, that would probably the funniest game
It's always left up to BLUE
Hi!!! 🥰🥰  I do art and I'm finding it hard to gain a following on YouTube :( please look at some of my videos if you're seeing this comment!
Ohh poor green (again xD)😂😞
I'm waiting for blue impostor tbh
Everyone is 3rd imposter except blue
Black did the naruto run XD
Why girls always die first hahahah
NICE
This is so accurate bro XD
white: and for freak medbay,nnfanfafnanf

Yes but the third episode make the impostors win pls.
6:43 I LIKE YA CUT G
Yeet ft
Part 2 of the reality show that explained among us for me😂
nobody will be sus of blue when blue imposter
6:10 Capt. Price voice? 😮
No one: Not even the whole world: Not even thatveganteacher: Blue: I THINK ITS ME!
Its sad to think that this game was so fun until the hackers came out 😔
can you do it in Polus the other time ı know its hard to do but it can be ı think
Did anyone notice purple just pulled out a gun there
Lol
Omg. He's British.
LMAOO WHY DO YOU KEEP KILLING THE GIRL FIRST
i was just thinking of watching episode 1 again until this popped up
Is it just me or don't u get so annoyed at purple 😭
Yes
The third one is gonna be blue being the imposter but he’s still dumb
When you released the video , I to played among us that time forgot ☺️
It's purple stupid
It's not really for me but I love how dumb blue act, I would be him
blue is so infuriating 😂😂
Wow nice 🤣🤣🤣
*i think its meh*
The naruto run at the beginning
NOOOOO!!! I WANTED PURPLE TO WIN!!!!
wait it was purple the whole time ??? i never knew
Purple was not the imposter.       HE'S A CREWMATE BEHIND THE SLAUGHTER
Your gonna vote CYAN off
Huh ... THERES A CYAN DUDE WITH A WET FLOOR SIGN .ITS THE ULTIMATE CAMOUFLAGED
Blue stupid
If anything, Orange is the most sus out of these two episodes
Make a third
Is guns real
Someone once said "sometime others kills other inside verbally than the killer itself"
my likes suck
blue vs red like every time
These are the dumbest people in the universe
Why do they always vote the one girl out first? I always play this with the guys at my school and before the game even starts, they decide to vote me out!!!
YES EPISODE 3!!!! the funniest part is when purple had the gun out and nobody cared and didn't think he was sus a all XD XD XD XD XD XD XD XD XD XD
"cYan"
Blue went from blaming red to blaming himself. Now that's character development.
Blue did it again!
they had my skin! 😀
I like how the British guy is all references
I want to see blue is imposter
purple is the man behind the slaughter
I’ve been waiting for this
this series is awesome! please continue!!
IM DEAD AFTER WATCHING THIS XF
Waited so long
Yes blue wlns again I feel bad for red

I’m always sus
Of course the purple guy quoted thanos

Black fixing the wires again...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIeyTVhuXDI
That means that at next episode part 3 there are three imposters
I have been waiting for this
great work!
For the people who are saying that purple killed but nobody understood. The kill animation is seen only by the victim. So normally in a situation like that where everybody is in the same place nobody would understand who the killer is. Because everybody has the kill distance.
You should do one for part three where the imposter wins 🙃
A"SUS" tv.
I laughed so hard at 5:58
Purple is Thanos
Blauw just hate purple

Blue is so DUMB
YEA PART 2 HAHAHAHA PART 3 PLEASSEEE
"It only makes sense if you are a complete idiot"   Blue (realization hits him): oHhhHhhhH
The reason why everyone says sus is because we can spell it.
No matter the episode,blue will be always the hope
Ohhh..... Blue is such an idiot... But I love these reality shows! Please make 3rd episode faster)
The Final Intense Moment:   Blue
YES
I love blue❤❤
Is it me, or does purple sound like right hand man?
WOW
Yay.
Among us 1 was incredibly! Well even this was good too
My only question is why does O2 kill us if we are wearing space suits
Girls first lol

At the start o thought it was purple orange says
Purple sounds like simon riley
2:35 *voice crack* ish
Man I really like this I would love to see more this really made my day

Blue is the stupidest
In the next video make blue the imposter

6:10 Mission failed...
Me:
He is british ??  I don't think we should trust him
Purple literally has a gun out.
6:43 I Think is is where the 2 million likes and views came from
Blue is now my new favourite character if this series continues 🔵🙃
I love this EPS <3
This is upgraded
I love purple saying " I like ya cut g" to black, before he killed him.
Hmmm is it me or purple🤔
It's funny how blue keep lasting long cuz the imposter think that they would win but blue just vote the imposter lol😀😂😂
I saw this one but there was no purple
Me when orange said ‘’I think that purple guy’s great’’: *its been so long intensifies*
:0 Yes these are so amazing.
Purple: *has a gun out and killed green.  Orange: ITS DAMN WHITE
For those who want the crewmate sign: ඞ

Please make an episode 3 this is so entertaining!

5:53 when you literally see someone kill right in front of you but everyone votes you
Purple is the man behind the slauther
Purple: TWO IMPOSTORS    Me: Yall arent big brain, HOW DOES HE KNOW THAT
Why is the last choice it always up to blue
99% of you wont see this but you are loved by God even when you have done wrong he still loves you STAY SAFE AND BLESSED GUYS😀
HEW da fack do I lose to these 2 idiots who throw there friends at the fucking airlock... 9:9
U guys should make a Mira HQ or Polus map
Last episode: TV's brand was Samsus In that episode, it was Asus 😂
5:05 . At this moment everyone should know that purple is an impostor . No one did not ask him how  he knew who had reported the dead body.
*Basically types of players in the game:* Purple - The mastermind guy Cyan - The one being betrayed by her teammate White - The trashtalker Green - The same guy always being killed at beginning (twice) Black - The accuser Orange - The same task dude Red - The same guy who always need a partner Blue - The same idiot
I am literally laughing over life
What is cyan?
توماس شيلبي
jhnn
Episode 3 plz it going to be a cyan and blue and red and black and green and white and purple
I love that blue always comes out on top, even though he has been a moron the entire time
Wait I thought there were 2 imposters. Lemme check cuz I'm not sure?
When you said far worse than that I expected you to say a rapist or something
If only the emergency button was a piece of steak everyone can eat
EPISODE 3 NOW
Irl Group Projects be like : *There is 1 Useless Person Among Us*
Purple kills orange orange shows up to meeting
WOE
Ngl I’m honestly white when they vote me out and I’m not the Imposter lol
I really like blue, and hes an idiot just luke me
These are so fucking hilarious please keep making them
Part 3
Purple: kills someone. reports dead body Everyone: "where" "where? "where? "where". Purple: "Cyan’s not talking it's her!" Cyan: "wait wh-" .      　。　　　　•　    　ﾟ　　。 　　.　　　.　　　  　　.　　　　　。　　   。　.  　.　　      。　        ඞ   。　    .    •  •          Cyan was an Impostor.　 。　.                 1 impostor remain 　 　　。　　　　　　ﾟ　　　.　　　　　. ,　　　　.　 .　　       .               。
Can we all wonder what is behind those masks? We soon gotta figure it out who is behind those masks.
Since episode 2 is 2 impostors, maybe episode 3 should have 3 impostors since it will be more exciting and enjoyable
Do a part 3 but have Red Orange and Blue still in but include xQc and the Twitch Gang doing this as well
Nice game
Like always I was just vibeing at wires Black my favorite.

This is gold
Blue: *in episode 1* It's red yo... Blue: *in episode 2* Smashing the table
British purple sounded Australian. Anyway, great episode! I love how Blue is a complete brainlet whose indecisiveness towards the end creates tension.
I use purple as my colour and I am indeed british
I would love a part 3 but can you make blue a tiny bit smarter thanks lol.

Why is it always purple. This gives me the worst re. Thing about anyone purple, either they’re some of the most helpful people or they’re the imposters. Never in between

Is no one catching onto PURPLE quoting THANOS?
I was literally playing a game where both imposters rat each other out😭
My fav is blue
Could you not show the faces? Because the thing with among us is that the characters are super cute. The human faces kinda ruin the cute bubbly style. It’d be so much better if there weren’t any faces
i like blue......             he is the best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11

Let's vote him out Blue: no I think it's red  °°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°° Orange was not the impostor °°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°  IN THIS VIDEO: purple: (holds a gun in the meeting and showing it to white while accusing white) Everyone: white is kinda sus!! Blue: I vote red he is always sus...  °°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°° White wasn't the impostor °°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°    Oh gudnessss!!

“It was Thanos that said that” XD LOL
Yay blue didnt die he is the best in the show if he dies i dont wanna watch the show anymore
Make it a trilogy? Make it my favourite.
I like this part 3:41
I love Blue mann...... His accent is so funny.....
I actually wanted the imposter to win this time, I may be baist because he’s British though
Do show 3
2:03 How was he able to get away with it it when everybody was looking at him
Green always get killed first and last time green died first
The part where purple say “Don’t worry will get it next time” the line was kinda like sheriffy
I love this series.
I remember. Black and I watched Orange scan, we said it in the first meeting. Then black died, orange was accused I said he scanned, I get killed, they still doubt him. It was just like “both of us who died saw him do the visual tasks, why do you keep forgetting”.
wow!
This video is too good.😍🤩
Slowly & quietly blue says (:Blue:) w—h—a—t—u—p—h—o—o—m—e—b—o—w—h—a—t—u—p I did everybody in the comments to read this (>:3)

Purple is obviously the imposter...   He used the Reality Stone and changed himself before the game started.
Why does it always start black doing the electrical lol
Hi
Yay the 2nd episode
Purple could just easy win in the last round. He only had to say: " Isn't it pretty sus that blue reported two times the body? I'am pretty sure it was selfreport!"
Black you’re always on the Warriors stop with the warriors addiction l
blue is a mood lmao
No one:  Abslutely no one:    Blue: *blue kinda lookin sus tho...*
I like cyan
Everyone: sees purple kill green  Everyone: yep it’s purple  Purple: yeah but cyans pretty sus  cyan was the impostor

They are looking like power rangers
Blue Is the best character in this series

Red: honestly I wish I could vote everyone off this ship.    Me: lol same
Blue is the smartest bean ive ever seen
Do Americans realize that not all British people talk like Captain price from COD??
I just realize that blue is the stupid but a hero
Plot twist: episode 3 impostor wins
You should do 3 imposters
Purple is the ultimate memer

He is British we can't trust him
Blue still thinks its red
Ban blue
I really love blue :)
Blue is a genius
Why everyone Is stupid in this match?
I think I accidentally killed him
Why is this acurate a person named pro ratted me out saying cyan/me when they were clealy the imposter i say "you soab" at purple/pro
4:11 Purple Thanos's dialogue by Purple 🤣🤣
Yassssss
Bruh, just turn this into an actual show with episodes, i'd binge watch all of them.
lol purple said I like ya cut g then he closes the door
plz do part 3, PLZZZ
Lmaoooo
Keeping up with the crewmates would be a good title
There is no perfect sequa-
Ive been waiting a year for dis!
Part 3 plz
i like you video
Every Good FPS Gamers be like: 1:45
Moree
THIS IS SICK! i would love to do this with my friends😂
Blue is the best
I LIKE YA CUT G
Keep up the good work
No more swearing please I am a kid
PURPLE IS CAPTAIN PRICE FOR SURE
i really like blue hahahaha🤣
So blue became MVP twice in a row
Blue is the only god ingame.
Blue is stupider then last timr
i swear to god blue always saves the day, lol.
Lol. The thing about Cyan being called sus or the imposter at the first round is SO true! Even if the evidence is gathered they just say : Cyan is 'sus'.
Blue legit MC
Blue is just  .... Blue
i hate it when i'm the impostor and i got ejected for the wrong reason. That last part actually happened to me and both of them vote me out  because i must have vented while i actually never vented. Well, that's also a part of the game, i got more often thrown out of the ship for no reason when i'm a crewmate
Pls make more
Part 3 Part 3 Part 3
"we'll get em next time " quote Don't know why it was so funny
This my favorite show
this is so true
I lost it at white trying to lift the table lmaoooo
I am mad at purple that happens to me in the game what happened to cyan and it's too annoying
We want blue to go out too !
Blue you were the how can you not hear that
8:52
Let the impostors win once would be cool to see it
Violet and blue kinda sus
Wow great copy of the first video
Ur gonna vote SAAN off
Purple: "You Know What Your Gonna Do, Your Gonna Vote cYaN"  vOiCe CrAcKs LoL
6:03 missed opportunity to have purple NOT look at the message. He wouldn't look at it because he knows that he wouldn't be imposter.
The imposter behind the slaughter
Make another oneeeeeeeeee please
Purple be sounding like Cpt Price
2:35 that voice crack
Blue is dom 😂 lol
Blue:I still think it's me
The machine said:purple was AN impostor
Blue only acts dumb, so the imposters would leave him alone until the end. 9999 IQ.
Was honestly thinking that Purple was pretty cool, until his voice cracked when he said "Cyan" @ 2:35.  Also, the last meeting got a chuckle out of me. Purple: It would only make sense if you're a complete idiot. Blue: Oh, I get it.
blue is always being the dumbest one but when it comes to 3 people left he goes voting off the imposter
Red.
Excuse me uh were brown at??
I LOVE WHEN YOU ALWAYS VOTE HER FIRST 😂😂😂
Funny but didn’t like the swearing even if it was bleeped 😔 and black language
2:35 his voice crack doe..lmao
I dunno, seems scripted to me.
Definitely need purple again if you do a part 3.
I hear some Kitchen Nightmares sound effects here😂
its already 1M views lmao
Blue is my favorite 🥰❤
Blue is the most dumb, but the most dramatic decision is on him
few suggestion for next project > add ghost thing or ghost comment. > add scenario when people in early game press the button > add scenario of people saw a visual task > add a magic word "if it is not him then vote me next" > add scenario one death but not found. so death player can not join discusion >add scenario one crewmate kill more people than an impostor
Why you made Blue like this hahahah poor blue😂
Why is blue so dumb
That was boring :/
Blue is the best detective
Blue: I think it's me
*5:56*             **Everyone vote white**  White:f*ck you (purple) f*ck you times (black) f*ck you 2x times (orange) and MANAMBXDVKSJK!?#@?!?       **White was not an imposter**
Fun Fact: When the impostor stabs a crewmate in this reality-show version of the game, They dont stab the crewmate, *they stab their backpack.*  P.S. Red, Blue, Black, White, Orange, and Green are probably gonna return in the next episode, or that’s what i think, I mean last episode they were in, in this episode they came back.
Blue best boi
I HATE it when my *Imposter* teammate votes me out to gain their trust. I don't like playing this way tbh.)': LIKE I WANT TO KILL AS WELL. NOT JUST WIN.
I know why are theyr not uploading its because making the bodys
6:43
the character purple is me XD lmao. pls keep making these, their great XD
Make episode 3
I need a part 3
Another sub from me!
When you watch these and then play among us, it is 100 times funnier. CHANGE MY MIND
It's nice to watch amoung us in  real  life
this is win win maybe lose if theres A 3rd one?
If you read this have a nice day!😀
everybody gangsta till there's 3 imposters
2:36- Little voice break "cyaaaaan" off.
Blues just vibing
Black is me-
YAS U MADE ANOTHER
(BEFORE I WATCHED IT) BLUE: I think it's  white.... nah, I still think it's red.
hese british i dont think we should trust him
Good to know they arent simps
Orange: Purple! Purple must’ve vented from nav to the other side of the ship!  Me: Yes, but no...
Blue is kinda cringey
Why was all the girls died first
Why is everyone in this video so Stupid really
Thanos is also purple😏 i see what you did there
2:36 for a saucy voice crack
I hate how they fucking reveal the imp right away it’s so stupid *no offence*
You should add the dead chat next time that'd be hilarious 😆  Keep it up !
I love the blue person because he is so funny.! :)
Mega video
Somehow i like reds attitude yea
Orange:”I think this purple guy is great” Me: *BOI YOU MEAN A KILLER*
why am i getting songs in real life vibes
WHERE DO I GET THE HELMETS? I want to make an among us costume.
Are you stupid guys purple kills green in front of you all
BLUE IS THE BEST
The sad thing about Black is that his first guess is always right.   If only he didn't always get manipulated and kept pursuing his hunch... when he finally realizes he was right, it's too late.   It happens in many games too, I don't get why people would forget about information they had in earlier rounds. Like, you know the saying: "One coincidence is just a coincidence, two coincidences are a clue, three coincidences are a proof".
"Hes british, we cant trust him"
Blue was so stupid in the first place, Cuz he always votes hesself...
Wait how did cyan choke when she has a space suite on
Not trying to be mean but purple crack voiced pretty hard 2:36
When black was shocked i felt that
Good one
"Uhhhh i THinKk iTs mE"
Aw man I wanted red to stay alive but now I want to keep blue alive
6:47 TACO BELL G

Give us more
I’m not the imposter trust me =3 UwU
THANKS FOR SEEING MY COMMENT
Bruh BLUE is being good at this pretending to accuse someone or himself so the impostors dont get bothered at all by him.But until the end he is the Mastermind LOL
Purple: "The hardest choices require the strongest wills"   Thanos is purple
I think you should post one episode of among us every sunday
YESS PART 2
that crack on 2:35 made it even more funny lmao
You should do sth about the ghosts
*_The astronaut behind the slaughter._*

5:58 BRUH THIS PART GOT ME SO GOOD  "MEBRRBRLEBRRLBLE"
“I think this purple guys great!”  * fnaf flashbacks *  no don’t say that  don’t ever say that  no no
it will make sence if oure a complete idiot  orange:vote purple Blue : being a complete idiot me: yeah probably they would win
What was the intro music that be chill lit
White look suspicious
Why purpel sound like the guy in call of duty when you fail
2:37 lol voice crack😂😂😂😂
Where part 3 at
Who is intelligent enough to answer this. I'm flat when I'm new. I'm fat when you use me. I release my gas when something sharp touches me. What am I?
Who thinks the original game is better than this...
Damn Blue always pulls through in the end but I'm afraid he won't pull through one day in a future episode and they lose...👁️👄👁️
Orange and blue good friends!
Blue is the best character here
Omg i am dying😂 6:20
the blue guy have different fan base after the first part
Next Time Make Blue Imposter
I love ur shows  Likeif u do
Blue why are you so dumb
WHY BLUE IS DUMB???? IN THE FIRST VIDEO OF AMONG US REALITY SHOW BLUE SUSPECT ON RED.NOW,WHAT KIND OF DUMMY BLUE  IS? HE SUSPECT ON HIMSELF.😂😂😂😂AND MOST IMPORTANT THING IS EVERYBODY IS BLIND!!!! THAT'S MAKE NO SENSE....BUT OVERALL VIDEO WAS FUNNY😊
I like how blue saved the day in both episodes   Also pls episode 3 with 3 IMPOSTERS
Alternate title: “The Office and Among Us Crossover”
why black was running like sonic
круто!  it's really cool!
Oh yes
Why is light blue not. Teams with purple
https://youtu.be/Un9OjOzMwKY
Wow on the previous ep blue always voted red and now he vote himself. That so blue
East or West, Blue is always the best. 😂😂😂😂
Dark blue is just so stupid 🤣
If only chatting was that easy lol
epic voicecrack
Is purple captain price?
U have to do one where the imposter wins
its purple his the impasta
*purple lowkey sometimes sounds like RHM tho*
These guys need more than 100 million subs
Everybody believes the detective without questioning him  Makes detectives have an upper hand in these games because it’s hard to tell when they’re imposter
part 3 pls :)
Blue is the funny one 😂
Blue should be the imposter next and win
1 milon likes for this
When u are early but don't know what to say:       Ya like jaZz?
What do you have against British?!?!
Purple:I like to cut g
casual among us round
Blue saved them again
Cyan is a Girl and she is wearing a Wet Floor sign 🤔😳
Hey I'm British
Green nooooo
Blue: i think its meh Real nice bro
yay this again
We all know the Blue is the true Survivalist here xD
Do mira hq!
Hint for impo in the next reality: Kill blue first
No simping purple
Crewmates: see purple kill green  Also crewmates: i vote cyan
On episode 3 what if everyone is the imposter but 1 and instead of voting someone they are killing eachother.
2:36 that voice crack though
i ship red and blu
Хотелось бы такое реалити-шоу устроить. Чтобы, например, 10 человек играют по 100 тысяч $ и чтобы человек управлял этой игрой, если победят мирные и все выживут, то каждый мирный получает по 11 тыс $. Если побеждает мирный, но мёртвые мирные получают вдвое меньше, чем победившие, а предатели либо получают 100 тыс $ либо делят между собой (если их 2 и больше).
Cant wait for part 3
Cool
Purple is secretly captain price
I think red
Jokes aside, this is really impressive
Of course dark green died first and had the dumb note on
I like how blue is so dumb at the beginning but then comes to his senses when only him and 2 other people are left
6:40 yo ya playing among us i liek ya cut g *slaps*
If they make an Among us Reality Show Part 3 with 3 impostors, The video will only last for 3 minutes.
Put this on Netflix plz
Blue coming in fucking clutch again 😂
no one talking how purp sounds like right hand man from henry stickmin
...why does purple sound like a bad version of thatcher
Where is the red sus for no reason and red get voted out
Why is it AWAS girls dying after
Too bad red dead to early
You know who's my favorite ? (｡･ω･｡)     It's Blue (I'm not gonna tell you why)
S9oooooo stoopid
Once again Blue saves the day!
Fun fact: they wear helmets to protect themself from Covid during the production of this show.
Can you do another one where imposter wins? Lol
THEY ARE SO DUMMMMMMMMMMM
That voice crack tho at 2:35
I can't belive my purple among us skin was in this video! :D.       Edit: I don't speak british tho

That’s the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard  That’s the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard
My favourite one is blue because he is dumb but funny. He also is the only one to not die and win both rounds getting the imposter in the final 3 (White in Episode 1 and Purple in Episode 2)

This is by far the best reality show I have ever seen rather than those dating and what not reality shows ❤
2:04 the others are dumb lol
Tghe Netflix adaptation
This is awesome 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣❤️❤️❤️❤️LOL
The actual game:  Blue: “It’s yellow, they vented on cams!” Yellow: “No I didn’t, you’re sus.” Green: *“I T S     O R A N G E”*  ...  *Orange was not The Imposter.*
Nobody : Not even a single soul; Blue :I think it was me 😂😂😂😂😂

İts so funnyyy
This is my favorite video
Episod 3, Episod 3,Episod 3 please🙏🙏🙏👍👍👍
blue episode one: red sus blue episode 2: me sus
Dang white freaking raged
i got sooo mad when the impostor voted the crewmate..   do a part but with a crewmate that have Infinite IQ   or just do a part that the impostor won or something
This is so cool
We need a blue imposter match stat.
i love how blue is just  "euh," aeuh," ueah," "AUEH!"
I love the fact that blue is the decider everytime.
A PART 3 PLLZZZZZZZZZ
Yes
this needs to be a series
Blue is the best player, he acts like an idiot entire game and votes the impostor out on last vote
Is it just me or does purple remind me of cod
https://youtu.be/Un9OjOzMwKY

No sé que dicen pero igual lo veo v:

What if they made a reality show of the ghosts in Among Us and how they have to reflect on what happened
I NEED EPISODE 3 btw I got impostor so many times than crewmate yesterday I’m not kidding
These are hilarious don’t stop making them👍
My name is Mr. Cheese
They are actually kind of wearing mask
Is nobody going to talk about  purple’s captain price references 😂
I love how purple is literally just Billy Butcher mixed with captain price
i knew it was cyan
your dead body is super real.Wow
i havent made a comment in the 8 years ive had this account, make this into a series please and thank you.
Its so funny!😂
I WAS DOING MY TASK
Purple and cyan should be gender swapped
Well get em next time Sounds familiar
Purples by far the best character of the series
They hermit is Dark
Blue sounds like he's high
Purpol is stupiddd :(
Hell yes
Please make video in polus map 🗺
Orange was be FL Studio
“I like your cut g”
I like how blue never dies
Why do I love blue so much
Part 2 ble
I think blue is secretly super smart, he lived both times. He obviously acted stupid so that the impostor would take care of him last, since he probably wouldn't vote the impostor anyways- or at least that's what he thought. But then, both times, he did indeed vote for the impostor and won the game.  But hey, that's just a theory! A reality show theory!
Purpel
I guess ep. 3 is gonna be 3 impostors
I think u guys are going to make among us 3 for three imposter  am I right
"Who throws their own friends out the airlock" Lol, says Purple who outed his own teammate
@2:02 that doesn’t make sense it’s not like the game you can clearly see a group kill in person
Purpel
😡😡😡😡😡😡😡stop making this ugly video their bad at acting
You can see purple is the imposter
The imposter should win next episode
Please do more of these their great
I loike your cut g 😂😂😂
I like how white says f you f you f you bsbdbsnsbxbdh
part 3 plss
OMG A PART TWO!
"We'll get em next time" "I like ya cut g" The memes keep coming..
My fav is when the person who witnesses it gets the color mixed up like saying it was purple when it was blue or dark green when like green 🤦🏻‍♀️
I don't know why but blue seems so sweet and nooby😂
When black was going to the report button: *Naruto runs*
Black X wires
"Don't worry we'll get it next time" that line and that british voice is pretty accurate to the line on COD mobile when you lose
Anyone notice the voice crack at 2:37?
Purp:Cyan sus Cyan:What no!!
I feel like the whole Among us just gonna target girls then let the bois find the imposter
That's what I wanted part 2:)
Cool I'm love among us
Where did you get your costumes at????
Blue the superhero
this just made quarantine better-
U said two impostor
One thing I know: Fruits can't be imporster
Es so funny wher white get voted
If this was a real show I would be hooked on it
Love the hats hope everyone reading this has a good day😄
*Early????*
WE HAVE NOT SEEN BLUE DIE
blue always drinks 10 beers before a new episode
I like how dumb blue is I kinda find it funny
nice video
A like yo cut G
THERE’S TWO IMPOSTORS! Green: *never gone to freaking kindergarten and counting on his fingers*
I think it's me
"I didn't do anything I promise"  -Impostor 2020

" ɪ TʜɪɴKs Iᴛs MᴇH" -blue
Pls not kill white in next video pls
I need to see the imposter win
Lets all be real our favorite character is blue
I want an episode where the killer gets voted off but just stabs the other ones to death and win
Next, they’re gonna make blue as imposter lmao
Purple dude;shoots him in front of everyone  Everyone else:UhHhHh it's Cyan  😆😆😆😆
i wonder what will happen if Blue becomes the imposter
Рагуоашаоаш
The hats!
We want the imposter to win
Epik
Did anyone else hear that voice crack?                     Purp: alright here’s what where gonna do, we’re gonna vote cYaN off
Best vids keep  dis doing

Now we need a romance between an impostor pink and crewmate white  And more blue, god, he's the best thing that happened to the series
Blue will always be the MVP
I love these!
i like your stile cyan xd
RawKnee's Copy!!!!!!
Why girls always die in the first game like lady's first
Before this game I never knew cyan was a colour , any one else ?
Much more episodes
Red sus #bluegang
Blue is so annoying
5:59 he really had enough😭
IDK RED SUS.
Purple guy the  behind the Among Us

Omg lol that was so halerois
6:44 I like ur cut g

Once again, this has made my day, also yes P L E A S E make an episode three 🙏
Imagine it wasn’t purple
Crewmate wins
Is blue TimtheTatman?
i like how they just dont know its him lol
Purple holds gun for the entire meeting Everyone: cyan sus
Purple holding a gun the entire communication  Everybody : *cYaN sUs*
Bro the color cyan just gets no chance when imposter, bc they ether get voted for no reason or get ratted out by your own teammate... I would know. I’m a cyan main.
Me: hey mom can I- Her: 2:33 Me: yes mother.....
"i loik yah cut gee"
Voice crack
i ship red and dark blue ❤️❤️
Eh, *I Still Think Its Red*
is purple referencing billy butcher
Guys I still think it's red!
Where’s pink
Would have been better if blue voted for himself at the end.
I  want episode 3
Hahah well done 😂
wow
Purple kills green* Red sus Its definitely white Orange u Cyan was not the imposter*   Just what happens in reality
Why is blue always the hero?
I think it’s me -blue 2020
AAAAh yeeey  PArt 2 and yes pls episode 3 and 4
It was purple
Yessss my reccomendation was made tysm!
I dont like blue
I love how blue gets to make the final decision 😂
Why does purple sound like ghost
wtf
I been waiting for so long
blue will forever sus on red...
“You wanna hear what I think?” *”not really.”*
Part 3 please
I’ve seen the first one I love it make more
i like these
*blue is airheaded...but the victory is always up to him*
Blue survive 2 times
Also you should make an episode with crew losing
Blue was dumb like he saw purple running away and said noone near
Same time?
Mabye you could have made it on Mira hq or poluse
"Hes British we can't trust him" wooow lol
MORREEEE
*"your gonna vote caaaayyan off"*
Another f ing part
Everyone: Watches purple shoot green Also everyone: WHO WAS IT??
When orange explained how purple would've killed black and vented to the other side of the ship it was kinda funny when they got to the venting from medbay to reactor because that's not fully possible in game. But then again this is fictional so yeah.
We need to see an imposter win
WE NEED TO MAKE THIS A SERIES
Blue is just completely dumb at this point
please make Cyan a hero, in practically every game Among us,he is accused of anything ... He is often innocent and accused without
Blue and red are my fav.
*2:36** was that a voice crack?*
Laugh Over Life: New Video "Among Us In Reality Show 2" Released Me: *Diarrhea*
lol, wtf 😳 1:58 I imagine this in the game🤣 And the best, the first imposter kill one front of everybody and designate the second imposter 😅 Totally funny.👍
Dark Blue is so stupid, but i want part where he is really the impostor!
Lol the naruto run👌🤣🤣🤣
blue is the mvp
That blue idiot
This is awesome! 😁
Orange: Finally people get to watch me do My tasks  Everybody: *Watches*   Purple: *pushes green and has a visible gun in hand*  Everybody: *Confused*  *Body reported*  Also purple: Cyan kill green infront of all of us 1:58                             He also has a visible gun here  2:32
Blue is funny
Well....you don't even have to vote when three remain....you just can kill one of them and you will win....stupid purp
Purple is the imposter  Me: *getting purple guy vibes*
Another one
pls make blue impostor
6:43 or 6:44 i like ya cut g
I like how purple is legit woods
K just started watching at 1:12 I am perdicting the imposters are cyan and orange  Edit: eh 1/2 ain’t bad
10/10
I can’t believe red is dead I’m truly shaken
Why are the girls always voted out first!? These videos are extremely sexist!
I LOVE THIS SERIES!!
Blue kinda sus tho
bruh i use blue and i do the same shit blue does in this skit lmao
T h e m a n b e h i n d t h e s l a u g h t e r
Yes I've been waiting for this
*I like ya cut g* Taco bell ding
I like when purple says i like your cut g🤣🤣
Part 3 please!
Make an episode where you sympathize with the imposter and he wins
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌😴
I thought orange died how is he still alive?
This just proves that Blue is a legendary crewmate😂...The best crewmate...He always survives
Cyan could have told that the another impostor is purple.Thats you do when your impostor partner betrays you
More blue and red they’re my favourite characters
Blue is my favorite
Жалко что нет перевода😟 Но очень классно зделали👍
If Part 3 happens. pretty sure theres 3 imposters. But can there be pets this time? There were more costumed characters now so yay
Thanks
I love Blue
Red is still sus
Why is it that blue votes someone for the whole round, then he is the last one to vote and he votes different. He did that in both videos Lol
purple be captain price n shit
I like how  all of the  pressure  is always on blue
I WANNA SEE MORE, THIS IS ACTUALLY GOOD, THX FOR THE GREAT CONTENT, IDK WHY IM TYPING IN CAPS.
Blue shouldve voted orange at the end
The way they say cappin is cringy asf
It’d be cool to see the third part have three imposters and more people.
Theres always the dumb one in the group 😂
Next time:- *Three Imposters*
blue literally had the whole fate of the game in his hands again
i like blue's taste in foot wear.
Hi
GOD blue is so dumb
hi its me red
I clicked it soo fast and the video was good 👍
FINALLY!!
Hi
We need ep 3 rn
It’s always green that dies first
Ya we need episode 3!
He kinda sounds like the gay from call of duty
part 3
I bet blue next episode is gonna vote skip
some legend says that blue still sus on red
Y doe blu make last desision all the time
For some reason purple made the most since it’s orange
Pls continue your work...its awesome
It’s been 10 hours and it already has over 1 million views?? Wtffff
Part 3 guys
Yay
Would love to see an episode where the Imposters win.
its so nice that blue still has sus on red
Don't tell me that I hear the meme bell sound
I would watch this shit all day lmao
Some people really do look like blue
Just like Butcher
this is good but blue isnt funny
Blue is my favorite.
"You morons who threw your own teamates off the ship," Says purple as he threw cyan off before.
blue is clearly the real hero here....even if he's a complete moron
Tbh, blue carries them all. Every game. Games 1 and 2
Make till episoede 1000
9:14
why the girl always die in space first
its always between blue
3:35 nice voice crack
I love the hats
Who was the other Imposter?
"i like it cut g" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
next time i don't think you should keep blue alive to the end because you guys already did that joke 2 times and it will probably get old
Purple sounds like the captain price of among us 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
PETITION FOR THEM TO ADD PETS! :D
I love this
The last one made a lot of views
Is it just me or Purp, sounds like Capt. Price
Pls we part 3
Bruh 1.2m views in 10hours you must make a show about it and make blue the imposter XD
Wow i love this story And blue is great lol
🤣🤣
Part 3 pls
ДАААААААА, 10 ЧАСОВ НАЗАД! Я почти не опоздал... Жду продолжения.
I really want 3 episode
I like ya cut G
I know purple is imposter that's me he have a gun on his hand it's me he might go to the murder somebody
Plz make red and blue imposters next episode
I thought the impostot was gonna win
This is so relatable it's painful.  Thanks, I hate it.
Blue really need to visit a doctor
For some reason it bothers me how stupid the blue character is lol
Hooray! Thanks. I really love this.
2:55 ...what if im the imposter and i just dont know?? -thats not how it works dumb(bleep)
Me:😑😑😑 why is blue always the second chance
blue is always in a position to choose between "he" or "he"😭 And the choice is always right
Fucking. Medbay.
EPISODE 3 BUT PLEASE NO SWEARS BLOCKED SWEARS OR EVEN SUBSTITUTE WORDS PLEASE
red is my favorite
Soooooo is anyone gonna question why captain price is in this game? Or are we all gonna let that slide?
WE STAN OMG EPISODE 3 PLEASEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
2:33 sounds like a burst rifle when purple hitted whites helmet with the pistol
So blue not getting killed by purple because blue stupid so when emergency called. Purple can accused anyone because blue can support purple so we have to be stupid so we dont getting killed by impostors.
Blue is litteraly the embodiment of all public lobbies
purple sabotages
Idk it can be me
6:43
I think its red
I like how blue is always the one being pressured to vote between two people at the end
To be conpletly honist I really dont like this one the other one was way better
I like blue😭
If you make a part 3 I’m getting all my homies to subscribe
1:24 look cyan head hahaha
5:58
2:36 epic voice crack
Loving this series already they are so much fun
i really hate it when someone is the impostor and he get voted out and he so mad like wanna punch somebody. BRUH THE POINT OF THE GAME IS FUCKING REMOVED THE IMPOSTOR
At least one episode has to have the impostor win... am I right?
Purple: pulls out a gun during meeting   Everybody: So yeah back to what we were saying...
FINALLY EPISODE 2 Oh yeah and plus is blue really just stupid or does he not want to be alive. And every time its always on his choice.
on 5:53 it made me laugh
I swear I need a series of this dayyuummm✨😂💗
https://youtu.be/Y_WUZ9hBlFA look at this

They just did a small mistake ... NAV can not be sabotaged
This is so good
Asus
O PART 2!?!? YAYAYAYAYYAYAYAYAYAYAY
6:11 i kinda get some call of duty:mobile vibes
Purple: I was in the other side of the ship  Orange- Convenient   Purple- How is that convenient?  I think we call all say that this is so relatable
purple reminds me of the toppat clan from henry stickmin
Did anyone ever notice that purple is imposter and scense he's purple he's the MAN BEHIND THE SLAUGHTER
2:36 gotta love that voice crack
I said this last time too, I still think it was red. One of these days, I'm gonna be right.

BLUE is a legand
This should be in the Olympics
Cpt. Price?
Oww Blue is very cute!
Green dum
WE NEED MORE
6:11 dont worry will get em next time
@8:48 me arguing with myself if I should eat more ice cream at 2am😂
Haha yess
The blue is immortal
I cant believe no one saw purple kill they just say it’s the person that said it’s purpl
Man blue is always the one who has no clue and I just realized this😂😂😂
im irritated at blue so dumb
I love how blue keeps being alive until the end maybe his faking being a moron and be the imposter on episode 3
blue: I think its me!
Everyone : *spaced out so if someone kills we know who it is* Purple : *kills green* Everyone : "who kill ?"
Shit reminds me of red vs blue
Poggers
Everyone is just blaming on eachother Lol😂😂
"Sometimes the hardest choices require the strongest wills" "Uh no its uh..it was thanos who said that" Funnily enough he's already purple
How come blue don’t have the DUM sticky note
When you use your friend as third imposter and kill them at the end 6:42
I love this so much the bike guy is so funny you guys should make more on different maps
Jesus loves you. even if you don’t love Him, He still loves you. share the gospel and put God first, i hope you have a nice week. in Christ i have found a better and more fulfilling life than my past sinful, evil, and worldly one. i live now with more happiness and strength and a peace that i didn’t find before. sometimes i just pray when i’m feeling down and i feel better afterward. God is good and graceful and has the most mercy over all of us. Jesus died for you on the cross, to pay for all the evil things you will do in this world, none of us are perfect and sometimes continue to be had people over and over, but Christ came down and through Him all things were made for us and for our salvation. He rose again three days later, showing that if He could conquer death, you can as well. The cross gives us salvation, free salvation that is. although it does require sacrifice in order to truly obtain, it is more than worth it in the end. Jesus please strengthen our love and faith and relationship and trust in you Lord, and with God the Father who gave His only Son, you, to die for us. in hard times we can’t handle things, but you can Jesus. thank you for your grace Lord, please send angels to guard and protect us and to carry us with their hands so that our feet may not hit a stone. -psalm 91. Keep us safe Lord! Amen. give us the strength we need.
Does nobody else notice the Call of Duty references?
"Holding a Gun"     It's Cyan!!!!
yay new ep!!
YESSS they have more hats now!!!
Why the hell purple sounding like ghost from COD
WHY TF ARE THOSE PEOPLE VOTING THE GODDAMM GIRLS OFF
Hell ya there back BTW did black naruto run and I heard purples voice crack
Blue always saves the day
The problem with Mr purple : 1. Accusing fellow Impostor is bold play often doesn't work 2. Why not sabotage lights ? 3. Stack kill is smart just don't accuse someone when shit goes down 4. Sabotage more  5. Cyan as a ghost could help sabotaging things
Blue is my favourite he's just a meme
OMG THANK YOU FOR MAKING ANOTHER ONE....I LOVE THIS...MAKE IT A SERIES PLSS
Blue and orange should have died first in my opinion
Purple the imposter?  hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm now where do I remember what and who oh ITS BEEN SO LONG SINCE LAST I SEEN MY SON LOST TO THIS MONSTER TO THE MAN BEHIND THE SLAUGHTER SINCE YOU BEEN GONE I BEEN SINGING THIS STUPI SONG SO I CAN PONDE THE SANITYOF YOUR MOTHE UWU
No one: Blue: ahh.. hmm.. ahmm... I think I accidentally killed him
Purple: I like your cut G
The moral of the story:      Blue carries
Green always to be first lol
Blue still lands the twist
The next reality among us show: Among us But Its a Reality Show 3 Where there is 3 impostors
Blue is back and red is not Imposter again lmao!
I love this series it’s awesome
6:44 literally me everytime.
Who is cyan squad?
4:47 is it just me that heard that i dont think that noise was part of the kill sound idk-
Make more
Yesss
"I like it cut g"
Its purple
I hope in Among us reality show 3, we dont know who the imposter is, we should be able to try to figure it out during the video and at the end we get the reveal.
1:53 he sounds like captain price
At first I thought it was gonna be red and blue. XD
pro tip: if you want to come up with an alibi, don't make accusations  if you make accusations, then you'd be sus, which is what nobody wants
Red is such a mood lol
Heard that "Price" line from purple lmao.
I FRICKIN LAUGHED AT WHITE TRYNA FLIP OVER THE TABLE IN 1:11
Literally me an among us veteran: 1:45
Previous ep Blue: it is red !! Last round - Blue : I knew it is white New ep Blue : maybe I am the imposter  In the end : hey wait a min I think it's red👉👉🤬🤬
Blue: *its defenitely me*     Red: thats my blue
Blue always save the day lmao
6.9k comments lol   The timing lol
Purple is my favorite
Purple sounds like hoxton on payday
Please stop making blue an idiot
I love these videos, but I'm hurt green had to be the first one that dies in both videos... that's my color bro cmon now..
Pink is kinda sus
Wait why would purple rat out his teammate cyan?? I mean shouldn’t you be working together?
U have to make a part 3
Yesssssssss

Bruh where do you guys film this
Wow among us go
i dont like cyan i vote cyan
Yay!
I love blue and red so much
This is sick cool
Make a video that imposter wins
less exciting than the previous one.
Man blue has the idiot savant perk from fallout
Blue is the saviour
I find it funny that blue decides on who is gonna win at the end lol
i love the intro so much!
It was good but it had the same blue plot
Blue: I think its me
Cyan: Its Purple! Purple: Its not me. Green: I think its me. Everyone: Voted Cyan  Cyan was the Impostor
Blue: "I think it's me!"
You know what, I ship red and blue
The Purple is me when i am imposter. 300+ wins because i abuse Iq :v
Next make blue the Impostor and give him flawless unintentional victory or something
The girl always get voted out first XD
So purple pulled out a gun and makes everyone vote in cryan seems like it has logic in there
i play as purple so im angry
So everyone gonna pretend that orange was killed by purple and then next meeting he's still alive.
epic
I LIKE YA CUT G- I'M- 💀
Ok
Finally!
That voice crack made me lose confidence in purples imposter abilities
Bro purple reminds me of captain price and the voice lines for cod 6:10 1:53
Super guys
I hope impostor will win next time
That was the best one yet. Purple played a good game.
O2 is going off and orange is the only one fixing it.  I can relate to this so much
Purple impostor
"You wanna hear what I think?" "Not really-" *"I THINK WHI-"*

I swear I am vibing with Blue.
Maybe for the third video, Don't vote out the Only Female Crewmate first??? I don't hope this is a trend.

Plot Twist: blue has the most IQ in all of them

Dude where is the teamers🤣😂
What if purple had just said white killed? Cyan could back him up, and then 6 people would be left, allowing for a double kill to win the game.
It's purple!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The third one both red and blue are gonna be the imposters lol
blue is always winning i love blue.
Why is blue always voting red?!?!?!?!?!?!
This is new
Red & Blue are my favorites
Black: The person who can't do Wires Task   😂😂

"I think its mai!..." weird

Purple kills black with i like ya cut g Black: what?
*Me wondering why the girl always dies first*
..I’ve never played with someone like blue and thank god. This was really entertaining and actually pretty accurate to most lobbies 😂😂 there was one game where I caught the imposter faking keys and I told everyone in the first round it was him.. why did the imposters win? No one left that lobby.. they killed and got everyone else voted off after I literally told them one of em 🤦‍♂️
the only thing worst than an impostor is two impostors
Blue is a saviour lol
2:36 I’m sorry but that voice crack got me
AYO IMMA NEED A YELLOW, REAL QUICK
Blue coming in clutch
There are so many memes in here 🤣  Love it ❤️
The intro kind of reminds me of “Kim’s Convenience”
Why the girl keeps getting voted out
*i like your cut g* Best part ever.
They win
This is more better dude I hope more coming episode
I love blue
Purple: "Why dont you stfu!"  *Proceeds to boop whites helmet with a gun*  2:33 (also why does cussing make everything better-)
Why is blue always winning
I like ya cut g
At the end : purple was an impostor
Purple giving me Captain Price vibes.  6:10  :O
The girl is always the first to die😂
HEY WHERE A GHOST ??? PLEASE EPS 3
I like the attention to the props and colour jumpsuits man, nicely done

I wish red and blue were imposters together

5:52 When your friends vote to kick you out of the group cuz they think ur annoying.
Add yellow next time
Why does blue growling like that? Is he sick?
Blue in Part 1 : *Red Sus* Blue in Part 2 : *_I think it's me_*
Purple sounds like ghost from modern warfare 2
Red and Blue... Are secretly in love. I know it for a fact.
I love The Boys reference! Hilarious 😂😂😂

"Purple was An Impostor" I guess you can say that...  He was the man behind the slaughter  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
PURPLE SUS!
BULE IS SO DUME SO DUME!

I love that line: "That was Thanos that said that."
Blue allways save their lifes at the end
Purple is a genius a literal genius
I actually habe voted an other imposter while I was the imposter and I told them they trusted me and then we voted and then
Red: dudes wiht sus  Bule:(votes himsefe)

THIS IS GOOD
I like blues personality and his job his character and everything , when he speaks i laugh over life :)

The long awaited sequel to an amazing masterpiece.

Purple: cut g  *Tacobell noises*
Wasn't there meant to be two imposters?
What if they made a separate chat for impostor and one for crewmate
It always comes to blue to make the hardest choice
Here’s something we’ve missed...they’re All color blind
Can we agree Purple was the only good actor?
I LIKE YA CUT G       *Taco Bell Sound*
key to victory: blue
Orange x blue tho <3 orange best colour :)
I’m not even half way through and red and cyan aren’t panicking so I think there the imposters
Their were some salty Bois in the vid
The girl is always the first to go and blue is the reigning champion
Nice video XD REDS SUS
5:52 When you snap in among us
plot twist: purple is thanos in disguise
Love
Why do the girls always go first!?  Btw cyan is sus...
No one seems to have made this joke yet, so I might as well:     ITS BEEN SO LONG-  Ok I'm done now

Is nobody going to talk about how he sounds like Captain Price.
I'd love to see a video on how you built the costumes.
Did captain price get in on this?
Purple guy more like William afton guy . It from fnaf 👇🏽
has anyone noticed how blue is always not the imposter and he always survives to the victory
I think its meu SHUT UP FATI BLUEEEE
Pls make another one! Blue is the best! 😂😂😂😂
This is so funny I just love this episode 🤣
"It would only make sense if you were a complete idiot!" He says to blue.
FINALLY
Blue is soo dumb 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄
White was the imposter last time
I am waiting for blue to being imposter
Keep making these among us videos they are amazing please keep making them
Me before video: *Welp, I'll bet this will be really good, but there's no way Blue can do anything stupidly funnier than when he voted for Red every round last time.* Blue: [votes for himself] Me: *lol I was wrong!*
Red and blue imposters next?
Purple: it’s not me Also purple: *Pulls gun in meeting*
the medbay vent doesnt lead to reactor lmao
Purple needs to come back and become a full detective..
Blue gets me every time 🤣🤣🤣 PS. Can we get a part 3?
yey
Keep up
Blue is the best character XD
Orange is always the insane one why I like orange What’s the problem.
Maybe for part 3 you guys could do something with the ghosts. I kinda wanna see what they have to say.
The only thing they’re missing is the buddies that stay after the person dies, the fake romance that develops only to be killed by the other one, and most importantly the classic ‘lime is sus’ or ‘I saw cyan vent’ when lime was dead or never playing in the first place
I wanna say stop spam scam it’s so not worth it on replying on comments
Isn't purple the person who played Neville Longbottom in Harry Potter  ........... or am I just delusional
YASSSSSSS
4:11 The Man Speaks The Truth Of This Universe
Nice
*I LIKE YOUR CUT G*
Purple's strategy sounds like my usual strategy
Why does the girl always get yeeted first out of the videos :/
Hello😂
Why purple sound like jango fett 💀💀
I just love blue 🤣🤣🤣
YAS PLZ DO ANOTHER ONE I LOVE THEEEESSSSEEE
of course purple is wearing a fedora lmao
Blue is just the hero of the day
Blue is the only one who makes hard decisions when it’s only 3 of them
Yoooo purple legit said well get him next time perfectly like the game
If this were a real game, Purple would say it couldn’t be him because he accused Cyan.
Wheres pink
That’s so smart kill in plain sight. Then blame it on your teammate so you don’t get voted off
Do more map in among us pls
it always comes down to blue
The orange with leaf is looking like a carrot😂
Among Us But Its a Reality Show 3 (and there are 3 imposters!)  And where Blue is the Imposter and he has no clue he is one
EPISODE 3 PLEASE AHAHA
Love the glock purple is holding
Now I really wanna see one with the imposter win because that's honestly the most fun.  Triumph while standing atop the corpses of those who believed in you.
First white then purple and cyan
Everytime blue was the last one
Blue blame red all day but when he saw red body he think he kill him lol
i saw them on tik tok
Can you make it next time more logically ? cuz no one ever had a game like this scenario. other thing blue should not act this cringe like a dummy dunno what's going on around him, pleaseeeee!
Pov: Coyote Peterson plays among us

White said some : so flip you! Flip you! And flip you! And your flipping med bAyAYaAYAY *astronaut hat falls off*

The girl always gets voted off first, poor her 😂
I love how blue blames a random person and then votes the imposter at the end everytime
Yes u was waiting for this
My second laugh
Did anyone else notice someone whisper “hey” at 8:19, my daughter noticed it and I had to replay it a few times, creepy
was Black naruto running?
Dub
The "British" accent sounds more like a hybrid between Australian and British.
i wanna see a part 3 where blue is one of the imposters, but he doesnt know and he ends up killing everyone and wins without him actually knowing. these are great lol
Finally theres part2 now
😂 blue is always the one who does the awesome last vote!!
Purple is that crewmate in ur lobby who is gonna be TOXIC the whole match
Dumb
“An Impostor”
Extra wise words from a wise man: "I still think it's me" -Blue 0ctober 2020
Red is kinda sus, ngl
I like this blue guy.
Where’s pink in this vid
Blue is my favorite color and hes always being a hero in the endings in ep 1 and this ep 2 ready for ep 3
It's back! Yes!
Never thought Billy Butcher would be the imposter.
Just me or does purple sound like Captain Price from Call of Duty
Someone else heard Purple saying  *I LIKE U CUT G* or am I wrong ?
Awesome film
Purple could've said that Orange was the one who voted off White
blue was kinda smart tho.... lol
When I was playing Among Us The Roblox Version I was litterly blue
Why blue  Iike  Dum
Purple sounds like capt.price from cod
Where are the ghosts doing task?
Let’s go! Blue came in as Mr Clutch after the 2 episodes
6:40 “I like ya cut g” that made me laugh so hard 🤣
He sounds like ghost
3:03 I LiKe Ya CuT g
0:32 naruto run!
I like how everyone was saying Susses and all the while purple was holding a gun
Wow!
Black must be the smartest Crewmate
0:32 Naruto Run
I think its me
we need a chef hat
I'm calling it now. Blue is that one character that may be slow-minded, but once he becomes imposter he's the smartest or least suspicious one, since everyone knows he's dumb. Please let this happen! But let it be a plot twist at the end with 2 imposters or something, but the other imposter doesn't know Blue is his teammate.  Kind of would be cliche to make Blue imposter, but I want to see how the actors, director, scriptwriters pulls it off.     Like Blue doesn't know he's imposter until the very end and everyone was voting each other off till the very with Blue and whoever else. Then cue the insidious  death scene. That or they just be casual a and continue tasks. I think Blue might be that one character also, if we're going with the original lore as infected that the parasite that infected Blue would be disappointed in him as he is the dumb one that messes everything up for everyone.
Here before 800,000 views
IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT THE HATS?!
Please make another one please
Blue sus
ha he had a gun and nobody noticed.
Make par 3!

The first one was good no the sequel is even better
Blue: red sus   Red: cyan rejected
The radio filter make it better
I think blue is a schizophrenic
Was that a real gun?
They need to add em ghosts
Blue is such a mood 😂🤣
I really thought Blue was going to vote Orange or skip for that extra ~suspense~
Finally I've been waiting for this
Black: "He's British! We shouldn't trust him!" Purple *is Australian*
If you watched the first video of this, you will know it's always blue who discovers the impostor even though he acts like dumb
red sus
yes
Why tf does purple sound like captain price
Its funny..but  no more interviews ...its scripted
Wait, hes british? i dont think we can trust him            *AMERICA 100*
Ara was
I’m tryna see how they make these costumes bruh
Twist purple was just killing people and hacking and it was actually blue
Amazing and fun
He was doing the naruto run lol
I wouldn't mind if this was a whole series
If Blue was imposter he could totally win cause he’s stupid so no one would believe him
Part 3
6:43 I like ya cut G
They really should make this into a real life reality TV show with strangers.
Purple and blue are the best
blu is the best characther
6:41 *I LIKE YA CUT G!* *ded*
That purple and Foster is the man behind the slaughter accidentall That purple and Foster is the man behind the slaughter XD
Amazing just amazing
WHY DOES EVERY IMPOSTOR  RAT OUT THEIR TEAM MATE
I was in purple's situation when he got voted off
why blue such an Idiot
Caraca mano e muito legal ver isso se algum brasileiro ler esse comentário curti pfvvv e ver esses vidios e nao ter legenda em português e e eu fico muito braba pq nao entendo nada mais mesmo assim eu vejo tamo juti cara
the carrottt
I HATE BLUE EVEN THOUGH MY FAVORITE COLOR IS BLUE
Blue is dumb
Why does Purple sound like Captain Price from Call of Duty?!
cyans head is wet
Bro dark blue is so big brain he speaks straights facts  "nehh."
5:55 lol
hey they got more among us bodys
Remind me of Markiplier and jacksepticeye
Last episode was crazy
I need to see a game where red and blue are imposters
welcome back
Ayyy! There's a second episode!
Trevor
LOL purple really said i like ur cut g lol
Yessss it's finally out
Part three someone should just not talk at all like that one lime person in every game.
Blue be like the only person who survived both episodes
Wasn't expecting another of these but I'm glad it's here. If this is gonna become an ongoing series then I think I'll just subscribe right now
Blue and red is so romantic
when I get bored I act like blue and frick with everybody on the ship when i am not an impostor. i will stare at people and do sus things like position my self perfectly over the vent just to get people confused. then I will say I am the impostor and get voted off, but since i am not the impostor people just start to blame anybody who pointed fingers at me which is usually a lot of people since I acted so sus to everyone.
Blue is all ways funny I love it🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
Okk
6:42 I LIKE U CUT G
This would be a Good Idea Ngl.
Plot twist        Blue was the imposter
The funny yet creepy thing is that I have a friend who is just like blue who acts really stupid and votes himself or a random kid and then clutches up at the end
Omg yes we need episode 3
Blue: im voting myself im kinda sus  Everyone else: ill pretend i didnt hear that
I clicked when 830,666 lol
The hardest choices are the strongest will
Stop making blue a complete idiot and fire the person who plays as blue
If this show continues one day Blue will give me a heart attack
You know what could make this even better, add ghost. Just wear a sheet of your color and everyone player ignore and can't here you. But you can chat with other ghost. Imagine the chaos. Haha
Lmaooo blues so clutch💀
Wow this was weird
HOLY CRAP BRO PLS PART 3 THIS IS TOO FUNNY
Wait a minute, I think that's meh 😂😂
When your AFK2:01
Just looked at the first one, this morning. Perfect timing.
In the game, you kill the smart assess then keep the dumbest one alive.
White and purple inpostor l
What was that voice crack at 2:44? That really cracked me up lol
Black is still at the wires to this day.
When I say I got off Among Us after almost winning when this notification came up, I MEAN IT.
I’m still sus of red
Can you do two more I like these kind of animations
will the third one be blue?
Purple is actually very small he voted teal two make people trust him
Did anyone notice purple voice cracked when he pulled out the gun lmao
Good thing its quarantine cuz their wearing a "mask"
"Red sus"
Blue is the wildcard of the crew
YES
Legend has it Cyan will never live for more than 2 rounds.           *prove me wrong*
Part 3 pls
Honestly thought purple was laser beam
Purple killed orange as his second kill so why is orange there?
after the two videos the girl was voted off first.
Harmbe forever
LOL
When purple said « let’s do this »I had MAD cod vibes Édit: And « We’il get em next time
PART 3 PART 3!!!!!   PART 3
It's ki ann
I knew Cyan was going to be one of the imposters. I thought blue was going to vote for orange at the end though lol.
I love this
For the views
you should have the impostor have no visible face
Blue voted red and then himself in this episode
Idk man. Orange kinda sus
I cant understand🤣🤣 why is blue is too pro  but hes dumb but hes actually the pro 🤣🤣🤣
8:10 thats not a vent that connects
I'm purple
Ya see, this would be gold if they were merged when purple killed.
I've been looking forward for this
Yeah baby      Its back
I think it would be cool to have an "Among Us But It's a Reality Show: Ghost Chat edition." Where once the cast members start getting killed/voted off, we can see the living ones but the only ones we get to hear are the ghosts.
Its confirmed. Blue is the true suvivalist
I like how purple is supposed to reference jack the ripper considering hes the only british here and I am also watching this after a jack the ripper documentary XD
You should incorporate the ghosts in the next one!! That would be funny.
yass part 2
Blue is absolutely epic
1:22 ah, it's The Gentlemen, where's Mr Egg 😂😂
'Eye lioke yer cut g' *Taco Bell ring*  HAD ME WEAK
5:59 go wobble wobble
Part 3
are y'all hating on the girls because of that's offencive
Yes purple is the imposter
WHY DA GIRL ALWAYS GET VOTED OUT
Reds my favorite
This is just a show about normal people dressing up as colourful astronauts AND SUDDENLY BECOMING SO DAMN STUPID
I love how red and blue always end up as the last ones alive
This is getting better and better!! The first episode was so good I laughed til I teared. And the Naruto run omg hahahaha
These people are more dumb than before!
Part 3 will be with 3 IMPOSTERS imagine
I think 3 should be the imposter
Purple: literally kills red in front of BLU. BLU: maybe I’m a monster.
Wait did I kill red?!? How? Imthink I can spooterman in the vent
Red to Cyan: Ahhhhh she's deflecting Blue: I don't know, reds sus 🤣
make the inposter  win nexs
purple is giving me corpse vibes
I like among us
Why isn't this in Trending..            Pink is sus
guys you are doing great nice very nice can you please try to make it long or 2 round thats great i cant wait to see part 3 i watched 1 and 2 both today
Yes . I love Among us but this is the best
What if in next episode, Blue and Red becomes the impostor. It would be hilarious!
Blue is Stupid Love it I wanna be like him
Call of duty vibes whenever purples talking 😂🤣
Well i guess the company of the spaceship managed to revive black and green but i dont know how you revive someone from a-     (GREEN GETS KILLED)     Nvm…
0.25  Your running like a naruto dude
1st episode blue: I still think it’s red 2nd episode blue : I think it’s me
Green: kills someone. reports dead body    Everyone: "where" "where? "where? "where".    Green: "Red's not talking it's him!"    Red: "wait wh-"    .      　。　　　　•　    　ﾟ　　。    　　.　　　.　　　  　　.　　　　　。　　   。　.     　.　　      。　        ඞ   。　    .    •     •            Red was not an Impostor.　 。　.                    1 impostor remains    　 　　。　　　　　　ﾟ　　　.　　　　　.    ,　　　　.　 .　　       .               。
Yay im only 5,6230th
True true
You guys are so dumb
legend says that black is still fixing the wires... .
Blue: votes himself   Everyone else: we just gonna ignore that.
To be honest, I half-expected black to be voted out at the start for calling an emergency meeting! It happens to me all the time when I have great evidence!!!
Purple
I’ve been waiting
Purple is actually Billy Butcher from the Boys
can there be a pt3
Purple do be Right Hand Man from Henry Stickmin tho
Wow
Good acting
Blue is the best character on the series
He was the man behind the slaughter.
Is blue on drugs or is he high
How is blue still alive is this going to be a running gag
i still think its red
You guys did soo much of hard work just to entertain us and make us happy , your content is no were else , you guys always make people laugh , smile I'm subbing you, love your content keep it up!!😀
Wow I loved blue so much
okokok that fucking sound in all of Gordan Ramsey's Hells kitchen ep was spot on
the purple one
Blue is so good
Omg i love the among us irl videos
Blue is the most idiotic person I’ve seen so far..
Top 1 movie... Anyone? Its just so good
Red: Everyone is retarded. Blue: Suicide is Badass! Orange: I can't be wrong! Cyan: Why you bully me? Purple: Are you challenging me? Green: Barely exists. Black: Is thoroughly useless. White: Everyone is stupid except for me.
Oh we killed him :(
Is it me or is it that no one realizes the fact that when black was running he was doing *classic naruto running*
I think is red -blue
White Ik your pain
I am purple in a nutshell
I like the way purple said i like to cut g😂
Orange is literally me in Among Us
Make this a season plz we need it
The voice crack made me laugh 3:36
While I don't approve of my precious baby boy red dying I still love this vid XD
Hey I’m here! Not anymore;-;
Dude the set for this show is so great. I love how Black is always doing wires and the footstep sounds.
5:55 I think white was having a mental breakdown lol
If you do three imposters I will subscribe
I was waiting for this :)
October 11 2020 9:17am
Blue is the best character
Make this a common thing
That was so stupid uys purple
I was waiting for the "I like yah cut G" 😂
I would like part 3 ^-^
I like how purple quotes a thanos quote lol I see what you guys did 😅
Purple=thanos quote
Can you do part 3
Why does purple sound like price when he said "lets do this" I got the chills lol.
My among us character is orange with green leaf on my head 🤩
I love these. +1 Sub.
*Next time, do blue as the imposter please XD*
l hope who it l never play among us
Yes I am so happy you made part 2
Blue that never dies
Blue is acting so drunk
So blue thought that he was imposter just because he was  not paying attention, and and he looked back and saw the body just laying there
Make impostor win and there will be manhunt    on the ship
I don't know why but I laugh at purple because he say "shut the f up". Yeah nobody likes That
OMG I love this so much make 100 parts    Oh my God blues hilarious voting for himself
Purple in british accent: I like ya cut G
YES OMG YOU MADE THIS
It would be great if purple was not an imposter and blue was the imposter
Purple: *LITERALY JUST MURDERED THE SHIT OUT OF SOMEBODY IN FRONT OF ALL OF THE CREWMATES*  Crewmates: Understandable, have nice day!
Purple is a pro🔥🔥🔥
I’m not going to be a bad fan but like I am kinda affended about the racist thing in this vid. The time he said he’s British I would not trust him it was kinda racist I’m sorry to bring that up but I’m British and It hurt me when he said that but other than that great vid😁😁😁😁😭😭😭
I like how purp is just waving a gun around during the meeting.
That choice on the end was really tough, considering Blue's stupidity.
Anyone notice how the girls always get killed first
This was smart. Same thing as the first one but somehow different
Is it racist that green keeps dying first in every vid
So we just going to ignore that purple walked in on black and said, “I like your cut G?”
Hah nice cheeky reference there Price
there is another meaning for LOL now.
Holding gun in meeting ingnore him nah  you know what blue i always makes the video traillinh
Part 3!!!!
6:41 best part out of the whole show
The black crewmate saying hes British and saying hes sus cause of that  Me:HYPOCRITE
Honestly always thought purple was kinda sus thanks to fnaf
Purple sounded like capt.price
What about the other maps
My favorite game among us have a reality show now
I think I accidentally kill Red in Storage.
"MORE"
E
In the beginning black was doing the naruto run that is good for weeb culture
So...the woman always dies first in this game, huh. Is it like an "horror" game trope?
In the ending theres not changed its again like part one can u change the ending at the next part change it with lose
Blue is on meth
Are we just gonna ignore he sounds like price from modern warfare
lol black always vibing on wires
5:59 wth
“He’s British I don’t trust him” lolol
but who was the second imposter!?
Just team up and tell everybody who you are teaming up with,
2:33 AYO!! He HAS A GUN AYOOOO!! LMQOOOO
0:32 i like this one
Black just give up
blue is the craziest out of the crew
cYaN was sent to brazil
Next one has to be an imposter win
Haha
do a part 3
Blue always survives.
I just saw this vid after playing a game just like this I was black
Hi
Every one of these comes right down to the wire
I like that reference G!. *@**6:44**.* Also *Blue* coming in clutch again.
I just notice the girl always get vote off first
I didn't expect a second one! I Let mejust put notifications on for the third...
Blue coming in clutch again
I LOVE BLUE
Why is it always the Girl are getting kicked out first 😅
so are we not gonna talk about white spasming out at 5:59 because that literally had me laughing so hard.

2:34 “HERES WHAT WERE GONNA DO-“  As he pokes white with the imposter gun
No one: Orange: *carrot*
The fnaf fandom be like “I think this purple guy is great”

I remember watching the part 1 yesterday for the first time But i cant wait for the part 3
Purple voice crack 2:36
“ he’s British, let’s not trust him “    *wow*
Sometimes the hardest choices require the strongest wills - or the biggest a-holes
The voice crack tho 2:35
Best blue among us character ever!! And I also like when the other among us characters would die and make dieing noises then the purple dies in peace xD!!
The female of the group is always voted out first
Good blye good purple gg
Blue has the best strategy
Everyone: “It’s purple!”  Blue: “I don’t know man I’m kinda sus...”
Great vid I just would love a plot twist both times it’s just been blue picking the imposter right and winning
I love how blue always clutches up
Lets talk about the intro..
BLUE ALWAYS DOES THAT WHEN THE IMPOSTOR IS REVEALED LOL
Good ep 2 it better then last one
2:00 purple kill green 😲😲😲
Blue:i dont know red looks real sus  Blue votes himself
To be honest I would want to see this on tv
why does purple sound like "ghost" from call of duty ghosts
Why do dose purple vent then kill then vent
Green died first I think im sensing a pattern if in part 3 green is dead its a pattern
Blues funny lol
Blue: Is incredibly stupid Also Blue: Lives till the last round both times
Captain price 💯
6:43 I like your cut g
Me: **gets a tik tok ad** This is how I make a blt! **starts cutting avocado and gets mayo out of fridge**

Black: *fixing in electrical* Purple: you fixing electrical, I like cut g Black: ahhhhhhhhh....
Purple is like ITS TIME TO DIE
Puple
Reds being sus ngl 👀
Thx you for makeing this video
White: *Tries to flip table*
Blue and red have a relationship that is unmatched
5:47 lol

Is that real gun lol, looks really fucking real
I like how green always dies first since the first episode
“I think I accidentally killed him in storage”
That was so funny!!! Party 3 plsssss!
Yes
Lowkey purple kinda sounds like bear grills
*Purple is just typical 900 iq player*
blue's the real mvp
FINALLY BLUE WASNT A IDIOT THIS TIME
Yessss blue your so smarttt
My favorite part is then he said I like your cut g
You know those suits and the whole Among Us game is pretty convenient considering the current situation with the corona virus. Haha coincidence?
Someone actually make this a TV show
Lets talk about why the fk purple killed him in front of everyone and they are like “wHo wAs dAt lMfAo”
4:08 lol
It’s so blue
HELL YEAH MAKE A PART THREE PLEASE
You know I know this is just A video but... *If red can see blue talking, Doesn’t that mean they can hear the imposter talking to when they’re talking about their selves killing somebody?, I take the first video for an example that white said black has got to go...*
Purple guy anyone?
Nobody:  White: And your medbalubaluabslu 5:59
Love how their is only red and yellow wires 0:12
Blue is my favorite he is such a crack up
YAY! I LOVE THIS SERIES ITS SO FUNNY 😂
Why is the girl the one that dies first
When ur the imposter and u vote off the other one     You: A soul for a soul
I LOVE THIS SERIES
I love that blue always have to make the final decision.
Blue is like that one kid who is stupid as hell but somehow always get the most important role ever.
*okay but there is an actual reality show that only has one season but is very similar to among us, it’s called whodunnit so uhhh if you wanna watch it...*
Jordyn so SUS
I want the Impostor to be IQ 1 Milion the next time and I want the man to win.
Hi
No one: Me: *sees their faces*
Green always dying first
Lmao
Lol  Purple Is Putting Out The Gun Lol There Dunb
Dislike and unsubscribe
MedbaAAaAaAaaAer
Liked for the naruto run
Everyone:*thinks about who to vote Purple:*kills green infront of everyone* Everyone:*votes cyan* Me:*hugs purple for no reason*
Good show
Realise how the girl got voted off first both times?
Blue honestly infuriates me
Purple is literally me and I don’t like it
Best Among us IRL
This is the funniest thing ever 🤣
Purple killed green in front of everyone.  Everyone: I'm gonna pretend I didn't see that
I hate it when everybody ignores the guy that bet his life to vote somebody off
. 　　　。　　　　•　 　ﾟ　　。 　　.  　　　.　　　 　　.　　　　　。　　 。　. 　  .　　 。　　　　　 ඞ 。 . 　　 • 　　　　•  　　ﾟ　　 Cyan was An Impostor.　 。　.  　　'　　　 1 Impostor remains 　 　　。
Nobody: Litteraly nobody: Not a single soul:   Purple: *I like ya cut g*      *kills black*
Didn't orange die...?
Little did Purple know that the bump he made makes Blue 1% smarter. Smart enough to activate his natural instincts of not wanting to get killed.
Yay I new one
That voice crack at 2:36😵
Lol, purple with farmer hat.. just like my friend among us char
2:24 don’t worry green was already apart of this
Yes
Omg I'm the carrot and my brother is blue he is stupid lol
Ayo number 2 is out 😂 what if they did different maps
Cool
When you're an impostor, but you legit didn't do it...  FML
Good job
Will we see episode 3????
Like if blue if blue is the best
Blue: "I D O N T K N O W. I think Red SuS" - Red: alright, I see how it is mother f$cker, I think YOU'RE "SUS".  - Blue: whhhaa,  maybe I am the imposter, hadn't thought about that before...  - Red: that's not how it works,  you Dumb F$%@$.   Me: in the corner..         DYING 😭🤣🤣
They all really got 2 brain cells
honestly, the only thing missing from these skits is a catchy them song.
Orange was trying to be a carrot
Last episode  Blue:i know it's red it has to be This episode  Blue:its me
Bruh the imposter killing their teammate is the most accurate part of this video accent purple was sad when cyan got voted off
this my new favorite show
Purple: pointing a gun at people everyone: ITS YOU, or maybe you, OR YOU
Among us reality show throw ppl out space no longer reality
Everytime I think blue is dumb and then he rechanged
You’re gonna vote cIIIYYYan off or ya gonna vote me -Purple And I like how they made purple the “man behind the slaughter”
This is a rare time we’re a sequel is good
I love ur among us reality video It's so awesome so I'm liking
Lol
Is purple supposed to give off Butcher vibes or is it just me?
Last night I had a game where I was the imposter and I was just killing in front of people and venting but somehow I didint get caught
Holy shit episode two
I was hoping that red and blue would return
Once again it blue who makes the final decision
Meanwhile with the fnaf fandom *purple guy intensifies*
33333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333and 444444444444
Purple is impost
Blue is like: *YeAh tHiS iS bIG BRaiN tiMe*
Green; simply agrees with Purple Weird fangirls: *”I sHiP”*
Lucky Blue always alive at the end
I like ya cut g
Why they removing the girls? In the first show they toss out Pink then Cyan cmon? I don't get this game? So the Imposter will won this time i guess!
I like....green and.....orange
*I LIKE YA CUT G*
6:42 I like your cut g
Awwww heck yeah
Next Episode: 3 impostors
yay
Blue is just that one guy lol 😆😆
2:32 I love how purple has his gun out the whole time that round  😂😂
It always comes down to blue
I wonder what happened if blue was imposter
Why is green the first to die >:(
Omg yes
I like ya cut g 😂😂
blue: hey....meh....ehh....mmm...mhmm....naw
I’m sensing a blue-ish trend here.
PLEASE I NEED THAT SHIRT AHHHH
The other imposter is the one who dislikes this video
I like how Blue is the dumbest one there.
Bro how come one idiot is always still alive
Purple: *kills in front of everyone* Green: Dude purple wtf  Purple: Wasn’t me Everyone: Understandable, have a great day    Blue: I think it’s me
*this is gonna be an underrated series*
How come blue was the reason the imposter lost both times
This needs more attention
Them: this purple guy is great me: gets fnaf vibes
I love blue xD
AHAHHHAHH FINALY!!!
YAY
I love blue, he gives us a sense of humor in tragic situations lol
I like your cut G
"i think it me " -  Blue , a dumb person
Which is better?  Among Us: Like Fall Guys: Comment
please do part 3
Why is blue always in the end and always have to do the tie choice? XD
If purple won i know exactly what should play at the end: the man behind the slaughter
Dam Purple really killed me
How’d they get price to act as purple
Is blue like the final ultimate judge or something?  He's always the one to decide the final decision even though half the time he doesn't even know what he's doing
Ether orange if red from part 1 or orange if white from part 1
Blue: kills self
For some reason blue is the one who is the dumbest and still the hero of the day
We need a white/blue/red team that sticks together! I need more Red commentary! You should have Red's ghost watch over blue and shake his head.
Did you guys get Captain Price to act as purple tf?
Blue and Red, the most iconic duo
“What if im impostor and i dunno?” - blue
Cyan and purple imposters
As a purple main I can confirm this is exactly how it goes
Yeah blue was good at this game
I like ya cut g (6:43)
Blue straight up just ruins the show.
Eew
there’s nothing worse than being impostor and being blamed for a kill you didn’t actually do
Ep 3 plz bro plz I gonna cry if I don't
I use the same thing ask dark green lol
episode 3 episode 3 episode 3 please
No one surpasses the intellectual abilities of blue. no one. not even the  most vigilant philosopher violet
I do actually hate when an imposter rats out their teammate so they can be the only imposter 😂😂😂
Why is the girl always voted off first
Amazing
When he said that there were two imposters,blue started swinging
I already know who it is and it ain’t purple  Op nvm 🤯
I’ve been waiting
I genuinely believe the captain price was purple
BLUE BEST (JK HE DUMB)
I love the vídeos u guys make
Lol purple I like your cut G
"he's British, we can't trust him"
Why did  have cyan as a color
Blue is so dumb🤣
"He's British?! I don't think we should trust him."
laugh     over      life.
Purple sound like soap from call duty
Blue is such a stoner qwq
Guys I think its me
black doing the same task from last vid.
Who else wish we see Red and blue be imposter and win?
Yo
Purple is Litteraly Captain Price
This has a nigajiga vibe
I wish the discussion was as long and understanding like this.
Make a season 3
Blue is my favourite character, I wanna be blue.
WHY IS BLUE SO D*MB!!!
How cyan was an imposter
Ok, I have the best idea ever. When someone dies, we should be able to see the ghosts and hear what they have to say. Also they should have confirm ejects off.
Get your here before a million view ticket here.
This is the best tv show
Bruuuuh i main orange but i am most likely be blue
I love how most of the time the crews blame each other on who's the impo while the real impo is just chillin'.
Why didnt they vote purple purple showed his gun
2:36 voice crack?
blue is honestly the best!! I THINK ITS ME. I STILL THINK ITS RED. HILARIOUS!!
Poor green still didn’t get to play the game...
Is this the new power rangers?
hello

I like how purple voted off his own teamate, its so relatable with me, i vote of my own teamate so others gain my trust and its an easy dub from there 😂
:O
I like ya cut g
Purple has a gun
Who was the other imposter cause there was two
406: theres a purple guy among us
Blue ughughughugh
6:10 Your welcome.
I hope blue gets progressively smarter each episode
Blue has the biggest brain.         *Disagree and you can catch these hands*
Purple sounds like Captain Price from CallOfDuty
I subscribed make part three!!!
They do be naruto running
when purple said its 2 impostors, i literally got shocked
It's freaking purple is always purple I'm mad and they just vote the wrong one this is the great video
Everyone has to know that dark blue is retarted guys alright
He said 2 imposters but it's only 1
6:43 Taco Bell Meme
Bruh it’s so true
Blisk from Titanfall playing among us? Epic
Nice CoD reference 6:11
Are we just gonna ignore the fact that purple killed black after saying "I like your cut g."
Why do I even watch these
They always vote out the girls first Why doe?
I can never get enough of bule 😂😂
Blue is my Spirit animal
What if.BLUE IS THE SMARTEST OUT OF ALL OF THEM
I don't know what to type for having a good comment so I will just remind you to drink water, have a good day
Early

Why does red always look orange?
I just hate blueeeeee!!!!!!!!🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
STOOPID
I would kill blue immediately every round.
woah the cameraman just filming how brave
Blue turned tables again, how you may say, when one of the crewmates keep on finding the bodies, blue thinks that he may be the imposter, at the last round, he voted purple, watch the whole video to see the turning again.
Vote subscribe button They mad sus.
purple: “Bravo 6, going dark”
A episode 3 would be awesome
we need a whole series of this
purple: **talks in an Australian accent**  black: "oh and he's british?"
Blue just isn’t funny
These guys are idiots
*why do the females always get voted out* first, pink was voted out on the first round. second, cyan was voted out on the first round too.
White: ✨Oh to see without my eyes ✨
The tape on purple's hat tho lol
This sets great lol
And next episode is 3 imposters and they go very crazy at the ship🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣do that guys🤣🤣🤣🤣but make the end blue and orange found the last imposter and they won do that plsssssss🤣🤣🤣🤣
There really is nothing menacingly than real life human standing and staring at you.
I like blue :D  When cyan was imposter, I didn't know, but I knew it was purple ;-;
This episodes is just about blue on his quest for being not dumb for 1 seconds
3:38 I Can't Believe Blue Voted For Himself
blue and red still goin at it
Episode 3 pls soon
6:07. Missed and opportunity there.  If you live under the rock, I mean... Mission failed, we'll get em next time.
Black: OWWWWW me: is he dead yet?
The 3 among us reality show.
Omg it's blue and red from ep 1.
Blue is my favorite character in the series
Very nice
Blue always is at the end
I don’t know red seems kinda sus
I LOVE these reality showsssss😂😂

2:36 voice crack though
PART 3 KEEP IT UP
White: That stressed out guy Black: The accusing machine Red: The lazy one Orange: The wrong guesser Green: The 1st to die Cyan: The extremely defensive person Blue: The dumb guy Purple: The 500iq guy
YES!
What if blue voted orange and then there was a stalemate?
I seriously want to know what hat blues iq is please tell us I bet his iq is 10
YOU ALL ARE DUMB YOU ALL SAW THE GUN IN HIS HAND AND SHOOT AT GREEN AND yes i would want a episode 3.
Twist: orange was the Imposter LOL
Yay part 2
You should tint the helmets
Purple kills green and everyone sees him push pull put a gun and then shoot green Purple: Cyan sus
Scroll down to defeat the imposters
The crew mates should wear rubber suits so they don’t get shocked by the wires.
If I had a quarter for everytime someone purple said "The hardest choices require the strongest wills". I would only have two quarters, but it's weird that it happened twice.
What
I like how it's always up to blue at the end XD
It would be so much funnier if we couldn’t see their faces
Who
Will the third episode actually have a start to the game with 10 people?
“I still think it’s red”
Cool
Do you guys really kill person
purple sound like ghost from COD MW2
4:17 you can see the reflection of the people who are recording him rOokie mistake (or is it)
el azul es como gerardo pero mas pendejo
Go down to find diamonds                           U found diamonds
Purple is giving me captain price vibes
I love this series like this if you do too! :D

I love how blue clutches in ep. 1 and 2
YOOOO IM IN THIS

you guys deserve so many subs. nearly 14m views on the first one and only 500k?????
How blue did not see purple
I like the build-up at the end
5:54 woah white is having a attitude but it was hilarious
Bruh these amoung us skits are so stupid and not funny
Blue always seems high
I love blue lmao and he always survives for some reason
Just because i now know there might be a 3rd episode, i subscribed. This actually made me laugh and i like it
Orange is carrot lol
"well het em next time" hahaha just like COD
i died when Purple said "...For throwing all their friends out the f***ing airlock!"
nobody: absolutely nobody: Blue: *I think it's me...*
WHY IS BLUE THE GUY THAT ALWAYS SAVES THEM?!
The man behind the slaughter...
Y’all need to keep doing more of theae
How Blue has survived two of these things is beyond me
are we ignoring the fact that white LITERALLY saw purple kill and then voted cyan
Wow I was just watching number 1 :0        Plz upload 3
*Blue:* Where were you when one of the Crewmates died?  *Green:* Doing some tasks. *Black:* It ain't gonna be me. *Orange:* Chillin' inside the vent.  _ORANGE IS THE IMPOSTER..._ 0 Imposters remaining
Finnaly!
blu hanha
The long awaited sequel
“He’s British, we can’t trust him!” That’s harsh, mate.
When everyone has -1000 iq
blue should have the dum thing XD
EPISODE 3!!!
Black always vibing on wires every episode I guest
YESSSS I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS  Srry I was late family stuff  (   3 (
Purple: **Literally holds a gun during meeting** Everyone: I'll ignore that.
Blue is the “Who What Where When, Any Sus?” Guy
Blue always survives
I think this purple guy is pretty great     *the man behind the slaughter*
Captain price if he played among us
Wait, Purple said a Thanos quote?  *Makes sense..*
I’m gonna wait for this to become a Netflix series.
Blue is just not funny
The hats are so accurate and its hilarious
Love blue 😂
Where i can buy those helmets? I NEED ANSWERS!!!!
When someone gets beat up but none can remember who did it Blue: me  Crewmates: person who got beat up Purple: person who did it Orange: my friend
I enjoyed that 6:42
Cyan represents me
vbrujh
at least black did not go uot first like every horror movie. 🤣
“I like ya cut g”   *TACO BELL SOUND IN THE DISTANCE*
Yes episode 3
*“Captain price at its finest”*
Little did you know  This was all just one big “The man behind the slaughter” joke.
I love blue
i was in a among us game and i was on the opposite side if the shup from where the body was found and they vote me off and i wasnt the imposter
*blue has been bamboozled*
You can vote CyAaAAHHnnn off
Blue: I vote myself 🤣
I-M-P-O-S-T-E-R
modification; blue shouldve voted orange so that its a tie
XD
Why is blue voting himself everytime
Black doing task- Purple enters- Purple:I like ur cut g Black:At this Moment I knew I ****ed up
this video is kind of sus
Lets take a second to be blessed of how dumb Blue is that it's literally amazing
“I like ya cut g” got me
Wait, Purple said a Thanos quote?  *Makes sense..*
Why'd you kill the only girl in the first round 😭
🔥🔥🔥
Yes pls also love how blue is so chill while everyone is panicking very nice 👍
OH MY GOD YES ITS FINALLY HEREE
Blue ep 1: I still think it's red Blue ep 2: I still think it's me
I really love Blue's humor since the 1st video.
Purple’s British I like ya cut g was hilarious 🤣
(3:50) I was extremely surprised
Can we see the ghosts next time
Yes blue always survive
Am I the only one noticed that the emergency button is a pepperoni?
Is anybody gonna apreciate the fucking set for the video? Its fucking great
number 1 was better because blue voted red always but noice still
Purple: literally holds a gun and threatens to shoot someone  Everyone: accuses everyone but purple
The best betrayal ever Kick him out if he wasn't an impostor kick me😂
Blue is a mood
Next Time Among Us: There's 3 imposters And No confirmed ejects....!
Everybody: Purple: *Captain Price Voice*
Nobody not gonna talk about how purple is the man behind the slaughter?...
I LOVE THESE

The man behind the slaughter
I always pick blue so, seeing him portrayed as an idiot makes me feel bad lmfao
Say what you want about blue but remember he's the only one with a 100% win rate and a 100% survival rate
Smartest to dumbest: Purple: smart Orange: Almost as smart Cyan: Same as orange White: Smart Red: Normal knowledge Green: Same as red Blue: Dumb Dumb Dumb
Pretty sure Purple was Jason Statham
I will use the “rat the other imposter” tactic more often
YAY MY FAV BLUE IS IN THERE :D

Blue is always innocent 😇😂
"alright purple was spying on me"  " *YEAH THATS SUS* "
British dude kinda sounds like Price in Modern Warfare Campaign....
I hope blue makes it to the end everytime😂
Green is always first to die
Blue is that one player that just started the game. For the past 100 games
2:35 that voice crack tho....
You guys are doing a great job 😊
ITS HERE
6:11 IS THAT A captain price reference
I like ya cut g
Blue is the chosen one
I love how purple was the one to make a thanos reference
🇭 🇮
"I like ya cut, G." **Taco bell**
Just the video i was waiting for :)
During the meeting, Purple just hold the gun, they still accused anyone else
Blue is just everyone that plays public lobbys
Oh and a Episode 3 & 4 really bad
Make more of this video

Comment Section: AMONG US SLANG AND MEMES     Me: IS NO ONE GONNA TALK ABOUT BLUE’S CHARACTER ARC IN THESE LAST TWO VIDEOS

Red is my spirit animal... er, spirit crewmate?
When will the imposter wins?
Another one
Purple: I like us cut G  Black: Waaaooaaaaahh!
“He’s British I don’t think we should trust him” black guy 2020 “I never thought of it but maybe I am an imposter and I just don’t know” blue guy 2020
I love the relationship between Red and Blue. It's such an Iconic Duo I love it
Make a episode three with 2 or three imposters, and maybe make the imposter win once
Me new sub :)
It always comes down to blue💙💙💙
Now do three Impostors
Shut up! I'm British
As soon as red died there was no point in watching the vid     They pulled a Neil Druckmann on me
Purple is British  Soap: Capitan Price is that you
Blue: *votes himself*   Everyone else: we just gonna ignore that.
why does blue keep coming in clutch
do part 3 I love watching these
I love blue so much
Green gets killed off first ofc  Bc purple was afraid of a beta tester
Imposter is gonna win
There always that 1 person who calls an emergency meeting 10 seconds after the games starts 🚨 😂
Make more
That plot twist at the beginning with cyan... didn't expect that XD he actually called out the second impostor! And now I'm sad that we never saw the double kill action.
Aye a new one
Lol reds my fav
Where are the non-english speaking people
Red is my favorite character
Yo make this a series
I think purple cause true she hold a gun
BLUE IS BEST HAHAHAH
They shoulda let the imposter win this time
blue sounds like a fortnite henchman xD
Then how come u got 4100 comments?????????
*guys...I think we can all officially agree that Among Us logic is extremely liable*
The man behind the slaughter was not the imposter Everyone: Confused screaming
give episode 3
The Cpt Price references were great
IM WAITING FOR EP 3!!!
The.man.behind.the.slaughter
Blue and Red is like Larva and the yellow dude from that Netflix show
People like orange make me mad
Love the flavor of personality in all the colors. I would also like to say that there should be an episode where us, the viewers, don’t know who the impostor is
bruh purple just killed someone in front of everybody and no one voted purple so lol hahahahahahaha
Orange and Blue are honestly the best team

Honestly white is just me every time everyone believes the impostor over me. Thankfully I say all of that behind my screen.
Yo this series will become the coolest among us series. I definitely want part3. Also good choice of phrases from Cpt Price, mate :)
How to win as crewmate: Blame yourself
Why does purple sound like captain price lmao

I love your video on Among Us
this video makes me proud to main red
Lol blue such a noob
"i think i accidentally killed in storage" Good job blue.
Why is this in my recommended?
There wearing helmets ...       how can they not breathe 🤔
Dude the British guy sounds like sniper from TF2
"Orange sus, to vent out of nav u can either go to  weapons or sheilds and in cafe it only takes u to admin or thatr hall. the only way to vent into reactor would be  in either engines therefore its orange" -is what i would've said if i were there and was playing
The perfect roommate is purple Shrek
Loving this series
Purple sounding like Billy Butcher lite...
*Purple speaks in Australian accent* Black: He's british.
*Thicc Sus* *Big Sus* *Sus* *Really sus* *So sus* *Red sus* *Black sus* *Purple sus* *cyan sus* *Pink sus*
6:42 "I like y acut G"
"MEDBAYFLLKWHDYYD!" -White, 2020
I already love it   Blue will always be the main character no matter what😌
Mission failed, we'll get 'em next time.

Yellow kills in front of everyone: R E D  S U S
Blue is sooooo hahahahhah i love him

Near the end it must be like using the wrong formula on a math test and getting the answer right
This is such high quality holy fuck this is amazing
When will the imposter win and there should be 3 imposters Red: imposter Blue: imposter  Black:imposter  The rest: all survivors   Edit: thanks for the likes :O  Man in 4 it didn’t work sorry guys better luck next time I guess
*red sus*

All of my favourite YouTubers, uploading amazing videos, which most of them are amazing sequels, and all of this on MY BIRTHDAY!
White speaks enchantment table

Why do the girls always die first
This need to be on netflix :D
Purple sounds like someone from call of duty...
I want a part 3 so bad
Purple do be smart tho
Blue is Literally my fav. Player!!
1:52 Anyone who gets the reference     I respect you
Didn’t orange die and it said red body was reported and orange is dead but how is he voting
Nobody:    Me: *using this tactic to win more games*
OMG THIS WAS 4 HOURS AGO AND ITS SO GOOD!!!
Ok but how did y’all get those costumes!!! I need to know!!!
How does BLUE survive? If he gets impostor, he will rat himself out.
Blue is all confused until there are three🤣
You should make a third one where confirm eject is off
Wait... purple guy?
Purple, truly a man of wisdom
I’m sad, I was rooting for purple. You did well, my friend.      I main in purple did I guess that’s why lmao
Blue is always in air😅🤣
Ummm you can just download among us
Blue is my spirit animal
*cyan was the imposter*
Americans say "bri ish" more than bri ish people
Cyan was the imposter
Blue we forever be the funniest 😂
All I ask is you have the ghost forms of yourself after you die. That would be amazing
Purple guy was the man behind the slaughter
5:58 and your medbayfowbdiwbsh LMFAO
Blue is a idiot I like it
Blue is good 😂😂
Is it just me or does the Purple sound more Australian than British?
Where is white the lightest color right now is cyan
Purple voice crack 2:34
Purple has a gun out....        He's not the impostor
I will always be the purple dude no matter what
Since there are two imposters, I thought that it was totally white and purple cus white defended purple alittle
Im am SUPER happy they made this second episode amd i HOPE they make more
I think Blue is drunk.
Everybody gangsta 'till Cyan was an Impostor
We need more
There should be a part three where blue is the imp
Why is brown always forgotten :(
Make the next video were the imposter/imposters win that'll be funny

Red should be with blue next time
Blue: "I think it's me" purple: ITS BLUE
Blue: the ultimate idiot
Video idea junior wants to become a basketball player and Joseph is his coach and it’s nears Joseph’s rich tunnel so Cody gets hit in the face and falls to Joseph’s mansion and they question him he says it’s not him then they find a sign that says Joseph’s million mansion with it spelled wrong and they run cause Joseph is trying to wipe there memory
Wow this got fast in recommended

Blue is my favourite
The fact that blue is alive and he’s an idiot is hilarious.
*Purple is the man behind the slaughter.*
Preeeeettttyyyy much

"What if it the imposter is me and i didnt know it " Blue is hilarious
Make it a tv show plz
No one:  Blue: Red sus
I hate blew  he so fat and dume
The dumb blue always survive
Everyone voting off cyan  Blue: I think it’s me :)
Yes!
Crewmate: Oh Impostor of the vent, what is your wisdom? Impostor: If were wearing a spacesuit, why is an oxygen sabotage fatal?
8:05 You cant vent from medbay to reactor, the vent in medbay goes to electrical and security. And the vents int reactor go the the engines
Tells him to shut up        Pulls out gun: HMMMMM BLACK IS MAD SUS
I love how blue stayed the dumb one XD
Please please PLEASEEEE  KEEP THIS GOING🥺
Blue and red should have been friends after the first vid
Everyone: *makes their choice* Blue: *ITS ME*
Am I the only one who kinda ships red and blue
How did you guys make those backpacks? Asking for a friend :)
9:00 Blue May be fat, but he is good at making decisions
Blew sooooooooooooo dume
*I think it's me*
Episode 3 blue should be one inposter and there shold be 3 inposters

YESS WEVEEDD BEENE WAIITTNNGHBPLEASEE EPISOODEEE 3
*I think it's red*
Black was funy
Blue: *blue sus*
Next time, add the ghosts
Does anyone notice that it always comes down to blue..?🤣 and then usually he votes either himself or red, but at the end he votes for the imposter🤣
Blue trying to learn how to vent, despite being a crewmate, is a relatable feeling...
Always the girl that gets voted off first lol
Blue is the best way to play. Dumb, clueless, and comes in for the win at the end.
Am I the only one who thinks that purple sounds like Right Hand Man from Henry Stickmin?
Everyone in public lobbies is blue
Blue is dumb
Make a part 3
Am I the only one that noticed the most amazing voice crack at 2:33
I loved how white tried to flip the table and then completely gave up 🤣
Sounds like Jeff leach
Blue #1: I thik it reeed Blue #2: I thik it meeee
100%
I love these
I hate blue
Yes  finnaly
I feel like whoever reports a body or calls meetings should have like a megaphone in their hands👍
Blue is about the average player in a public lobby.
Make a 3 this is sooo funny
Blue always comes in cluch at the end
Eyy I think it’s cyan even tho the whole crew was there  BLUE: I think it was me
Dark blue is jokes, by far my fav crew mate! 😂
is purple captain price?
Fo more
Ideas for next episode: 1. Have it take place in MIRA HQ 2. Make blue either imposter or 'Third' imposter (aka make them defend and help the imposter/s without realising it)
i love blue.
5:46 I love what white did
Blue is the best lmfao
I have grown to hate blue.
i think its me
2:36 that voice crack tho 😂😂
Captain Price leading the crewmates!
This is the best thing on yt I’ve been waiting for part two
Wait there was supposed to be two imposters.
8:05  ....You can't vent from medbay to reactor- You vent from medbay to security, then run to reactor '-'
Why cant we see the russian man again
Episode 1 Blue :It's red  Episode 2 Blue :It's me
i swear to god i love red and blue
Episode 2 pog
"Guys I think its me" - blue

ORANG DIED AND HE IS STILL THERE WHAT THE ####
Blue is the best character he is the only reason why this series is funny
Nooooo red
purple is captain price
Yes
Where did you get the helmets?
Did anyone else notice that Purple said "I like ya cut g" to Black before he sabotaged the doors at 6:43?  Edit: the Taco Bell noise also played after he sabotaged.
2:37 That voice crack 😂
Clearly purple is just captain price in an undercover
I love how white tried to flip the table
I love blue's character arcs
THIS IS WHAT ALWAYS HAPPENS PLZ SOMETHING NEW
“ur gonna vote cyAN off..” oof voice crack kinda sus

love how it comes down to blue every TIME
“They are British? We shouldn’t trust them”
Aaah I f*cking love how he’s brittish, it ONLY makes it better😂
the best reality show i have ever seen
i still think its red
Orange got big brain
We need a part 3 where blue is the impostor and always accuses himself and nobody believes him
Part 3
Blue always unknowingly decides the fate of the game.
Bruh why green always dies first? lmao
Episode 3 PLEASE !!!!!!!!!
can someone tell me why black struggling fixing wirea
We need a part 3 where they finally realize that the easiest solution is ask the computer...He always who is the impostor
how do they get them costumes can i get a link?
you can't report a body during a sabotage event lol.
Dude. The heck, why is blue voting himself out
i like ya cut, g
Blue: (.     _    .)
Why is no one talking about how good the set is!
Purple sounds Australian more than british
I like de way he says “I ThInK iT’s MeH” XD
Yessssss
I think orange is the best
I think it's me
Finnaly a sequel
6:43 that made me laugh so f hard xd
black is the best no cap.
Cyan being an imposter was the biggest plot twist ever
Purple with his mad quotes
I cant believe captain price is the imposter
I going with red
I thought it was a twist and there was actually 3 imposters
Yes 3?
I love this show <3
i feel like im orange making stupid accusations
yes
Hope you guys walk like in the game though. :)
except I'm smarter than toast
What I want to know is where you got the costumes from
Should add the mini crewmate one way or another
No lie though. Among Us would be such a good show.
Bruh they were not stack on top of eachother how did they did not know who was the imposter
purple: I like ya cut g.
Alright so it's all about majority so [___] you, [___] you, [___] you... 😂😂💥 (In the memories of white)
Meanwhile:  White: UGH what fucking morons. Red: Guess who it was. White: Orange? Cyan: nah it was purple, that fucking dick voted his own teammate off. White: Dang...
How does someone as stupid as blue keep surviving
Blue is the best player, always clutching
People have trust issues in among
I love purple
I just want to say, if you are an imposter and your rat out the other imposter to save your own skin, you are the biggest scumbag in the universe.
this sis halarious
I love blue XD
Blue is literally us! when we played Among Us For the first time cuz Not gonna lie, red is pretty sus.
Me: following my crewmates to make sure nobody gets killed. Teammate: why are you following me? Thats sus. Me: ok sure I'll just let you go by yourself and get killed then. Teammates: *get killed* Me: "see, you're dumb as fuck."
6:40 I like ur cut g
Black sees purple reaction oh heel na
Purple is like captain price
BLUE Is my fav character     No cap LOL😂😂
Blue is still my favourite character
Ep 3!!!!!!!!!
I'm sorry but why don't you guys kill off blue first.
Pls more
Than it is 3
I love how blue always survives being the dumbest one
Blue is drunk as hell
WE NEED A SERIES, THIS SHOULD BE PUT ON NETFLIX OMGGG
9:00 suddenly blue left the game XD
are you sure this is going to be free on netflix :0
*We need an episode 3* 😂
hey i used the exact same helmet for my cosplay! I made mine yellow ^^
So glad season 2 is out
Bruuuu the blue crewmate is actually real  dumb ass players lol
If you do a 3rd part, have 3 imposters and the 2 of them that don't get the first kill both say that they were in vents so it couldn't have been them and then they all take that as an alibi
BLUE WAS A PRO PLAYER
If not purple why he has gun
I love the sound design, mixing the among us sounds with your own sounds! It really makes this good!
Facts, they spitten facts.
Good morning and you make this early us to see
I laughed my ass so fucking much. This blue is hillarious
Of course it ends
The man behind the slaughter
"He's British??" Starts speaking in an Australian accent
Purple: I liok ya cut g. 6:43
IRL murder :D
PURPLE GUY!!
Blue is my favourite character by far   Also who else expected blue to vote himself at the end
Me: Reports body Everyone: That's sus Me: Doesn't report body Everyone: That's sus
Of course the Purple Guy is the killer
I for real thought blue would say I think it’s red
Pls do Part 3🥺
Among The Suspect
This was amazing the 2nd time.
"he's british, we should not trust him"
Amonkey us
"Red sus" 😂😂
Purple: The man behind the slaughter?
YAS AN EPISODE 2!!
I love how it's always blue that has to make the decision😂😂😂
Lol it always comes down to blue
5:59 XD
Words can’t explain how true and good this is.
The naruto run is just perfection just like the Thanos quotes of purple
are we not going to talk about how during the meeting after greens death, purple was pointing a gun at people lmao
Just because someone is british doesnt mean u cant trust them!!!
I wise I was there I am 11 TnT
“I like ya cut g”oof he is ded
IS NO ONE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW PURPLE DID THE ‘I LIKE YA CUT G’ ????
Plot twist: there was 3 impostors and Orange was the 3rd one
Green must be new.  He dies first in every game.
6:40 heh nice
6:11 call of duty , among us crossover???
Nobody gonna talk about how i like ya cut g?
Yes totally
Black is right ever time it comes to top 5 or lower
Nice
There we go! :D
5:51 I like white and blue
Blue is best player hands down
I knew it was purple
Putple my actualy character
This is the number of times black has been shocked by doing the wires task. ⬇️
I think blue is my favorite character lol cus literally the whole game he votes one person then when there’s 3 people he votes the right person
Actually, if there's coming a part 3, I'll fucking die of happiness
Thats a bit sus, that you released another video...
Do more videos bro
Nobody       Blue: eeeh meeeh naah
Every time I play among us : Someone gives proof they’re not imposter. Someone : mad sus. Another guy : it’s not me Someone : he has a point.
What is cyan???
*why is black always doing electrical*
*patiently waits for purple merch because I main purple UwU*
Yep it’s not purple when he is Threatening threatening all of them and holding a gun to someone’s head and it has to be white
YASSSSSSSSSSSSSS
White: OOF U, OOF U, OOF U, AND UR MEDBNSJHBAANHBJWJBSGXBSXSBTXSXSXKSNXSHXVJ
Purple sounding like Captain Price
Literally this happened to me! I was in reactor and they voted me off because I was on the opposite side of the map from the body. It wasn’t even me
“We’ll get em next time”  I’m literally getting Captain Price and Gaz vibes from this British dude (Call Of Duty Modern Warfare remastered or Call Of Duty 4)
hyo
Not the thanos quote
what about 3 impostors but 1 of them is new player :D
Purple is that guy who has a plan but gets killed trying to attempt it
What is the sniper from tf2 doing in among us?
Funny
But in real game we shouldnt kill our friends
the frustration of playing with strangers
I like how purple was holding a gun during the 2nd meeting and no one noticed it
please if you do a next episode kill blue first XD
This is a dream😂
Of course it's purple. Everyone knows bad guys are usually played by british ppl jk
Blue's decision wins the game
They're all sus wym
Wait purple guy? Purple guy: laughs in slaghter
This is the best 😂😂
I love blue
3:36 XD
Y'know, i still think it's red..
I wish I could blow up the WHOLE INTIRE SHIP
now there is merch that says "I think it's red"
Reminds me of the old RvB days I love these
Blue is basically CallMeKevin.
Here before 1 million views
No sé que dice pero miente :v
6:11 mission failed.......
Damn purple sounds like captain price
Les go
you shouls make blue the imposter for once
Finally a part 2!! I love this series
YOU GUYS GOTTA KEEP DOING THESE !!!!!!
Do part 3 with 3 imposters
Guys the imposter is an alien shapeshifter
Blue Lost His Mind Because Hes Saying That Its Him. But Its Purple
it would be better if they didn't swear
I actually clapped at the end when blue made the right decision :). Bravo mate, bravo
Blue is officially classified as stupid
“No worries we’ll get ‘em next time” -Purple, a British person.
I love how blue is always comic relief... I think it was me.
It's always up to blue to save the day
I love how cyan has a wet floor sign on hear head
I love how in both episodes THE GIRL WAS VOTED OFF FIRST THANKS GUYS
i hated purple from the start, and even more during the middle because hes edgy. P.S red and black are my favorites
Funny I play purple and do this exact same thing as imposter trying to be the voice of reason
Purple sounds like he about to destroy vought
0:31 the naruto run 😂😂
Why does purple sound like someone from cod
Purple: sometimes the hardest choices requires the strongest wills.    Thanos: hey that’s my line
I F###### hate videos that the photo shows that I started watching it, just stop it
Let’s see how long until this video gets 10,000000 views
Purple and white are sus
The part3 would be blue again were he decide which I the imposter *hit the like for team blue*
Since i cabt reply ama just say YES
Part 3 plzzzzzz
UhHHH I ThInK It'S reD
All you have to do is either agree with blue(when he thinks you're the impostor) or just spit nonsense (of he believes himself is the impostor) to win with him...
Nice set
Blue is such a cute idiot bro 😆
I love vids like this
Am I early?
This came up in my recommendation bc I watch way to much among us so I'm not mad just happy
Part 3 plis =D (please make blue impostor next time would be rlly funny)
This is what among us did to us smh
First
Thank god they got the girl out first
I liked how purple was the one to say “the hardest choices require the strongest wills”
FOR PART 3 I NEED RED TO HAVE DEVIL HORNS,BLUE NEEDS TO HAVE ON A SKI MASK,WHITE NEEDS A HALO,BLACK NEEDS TO WEAR THE FEDORA THIS TIME,PINK NEEDS A CHERRY or flower,ORENGE NEEDS THE PUMPKIN HAT,AND BROWN NEEDS THE BEANIE
The girl always has to get kicked out of the ship
Omg hii
Red should be imposter next time and the crews like u always say red but its actually red
Once again, fare resides in Blue’s hands.
I left to eat when I was waiting when I came back,it was here
2:55 “I’m the last person I woulda suspected, but I was looking for ME all the time! It’s the perfect crime!”
‘You wanna know what I think?’ ‘Not really’  So accurate
Is it just me or did purple sound a lot like Billy Butcher from The Boys?? Especially when he says “diabolical”
i ship red & dark blue
Blue survived again
I love this show.
I think yellow sus
Black with the gun on his hand on emergency meeting pointing to white and cyan*   The people’s: cyan is sus  2:32
"I think this purple guy is great!" Matpat is crying right now
Lmao
Episode 3 pleaseee
Purple: *shoots green* Also Purple: why would cyan do this?
Blue : Red sus Red : I am the immostor Blue : oh wait he can't be him...
Purple: watches the boys once  Also Purple: DIaBoLIcAL
Does purple remind anyone else of captain Price
Blue so blur ahhahaha
Blue:I think its me Me:Blue is literally the dumbest character I have seen.
YAY PART 2
Orange is big brained
I wonder what red and blue as impostors would be like lol
RIP red, he was kinda sus
Blue is the protagonist of this anime
Blue is a legend, change my mind  - I think it's me. - I vote for me - I think I killed him in storage
"we all see it right? They're all idiots." Is the truest line in the video
Orange: you wanna know what I think?  Purple: no not really 😂😂  Me to every third imposter play
2:37 that voice crack tho 😂😂
These suits look like hazmat suits if TLC has a series where people had to do disgusting things and they had to clean up a bathroom with poop everywhere and the sequence is that they are arguing who is going to clean the most nastyest part
Tokyo😍🔥🔥 https://youtu.be/m1E7Hsu0uoc
Poor Green he always dies first
Purple couldn't wait on killing, kill in public, and somehow convince (threaten) everyone that he is innocent. True O.J Simpson lmao
That fat dude in blue is so annoying
We can say he was " the man behind the slaughter " HAHAHhahah ha ha ha h a vote me off
Yes
Omg yes
An amazing sequel
Blue is a idiot
orange said it was white why the fuck didetn purpole use that as defense
Nobodys talking about how purple sounds like captain price
Not gonna lie I think it might be blue.
Blue is SO FUNNY
I FUCKING LOVE BLUE AHHAHAHAHQHQHHQ
I love this show 🥺 lol my brother is so obsessed with among us that he mad a minecraft world of it lol 😂
Red is the best
My colour is blue when i play and u swear they've seen me play cuz blue really is me
I loved this! I hope they do more and this was hilarious
I guess the purple guy was the man behind the slaughter
I think it’s me
Emily as protagonist for among us Pt.3 next, who's with me
OK but if you gonna make another video about that make imposters win
Notice how its black who presses the buttons over something useless, this is too real
6:43 the best part of the vid
why is green the first one to die
Where do you get those Austronalt helmets? I need one for a cosplay and love ya video I just wish I fount it suner
^Purple shoots green^  Greens bottom half-*haha,science*
Lmaooo
OMG YES
You said 2 imposters
Best reality show I've ever seen, keep it up.
It’s funny how PURPLE said a Thanos quote lmao.
These guys keep doing tasks  Me:i canv even swipe a card
0:32 We gotta love those Naruto runners.
"That logic would only make sense to an idiot"  Exactly. That's where you lost, purple.
Red sus
"I like your cut, G" lmao
Next time Blue red and orange are impostor
Please make more with blue! Blue is the best
For episode 3 can we see the perspective of the ghosts of the dead crew members?
omg yes please I need more of this! Can you do one with 3 Imposters??
Man said "i like ya cut g" 😂😂😂😂😂
I love blue
*now this is the peak of reality television*
me when I win in among us: GG guys we did it I when I'm the impostor and lose: I'm just like purple
Among Us but it's a Reality Show 3 They have clothing on
Still can't convince me to start saying "sus"
This is a great video
IM HERE FOR PART 2 OF THE BEST VIDEO ON YOUTUBE
Why does the game always ride on blue
What
Why can’t the impostor ever win.....
Blue is very funny

When they make a part 3 there will be 3 imposters
Orange: Its WHITE   Common sense: PURPLE HOLDING A GUN FOR CHRISTS SAKE
Vibing at wires
Netflix's adaptation be like:
Gaaaay
Most quotable series ever.
The best show ever
Make episode 3!
YAY THE SEQUEL
Why does the chick get kicked out first again?
It’s not what she said anymore it’s that’s what thanos said.
The impostor: he is sus he walked in a weird way The others:understandable have a great day
I WANT EP 3
The first one was WAY better
What helmets did you use? pls pls pls reply
Did purple just meme black?!

“Cyan sus”  *Holds out a GUN*
THANK YOU FOR PUTTING PURPLE AS THE IMPOSTER AND HAVING HIM HAVE THE BLACK FEDORA💜💜💜💜CUZ HE AND RED IS ALWAYS SUS AND BLACK ALWAYS KNOW WHO IS THE IMPOSTER
"I LIKE YA CUT G"   *_D I N G-_*

Among Us In A Nutshell: *Idiots who throw their own friends out the focking airlock*
Yeeeeeeessssss part 2

Thanos
Why does the girl always get ejected first
Like ya cut g         *Taco bell sound*
These are soooo good
Vithe is best😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I waited for this for so long
white really tried to flip that table huh
Purple: Its worse than an impostor  *What is it?*  *2 IMPOSTORS*  *confused screaming*
Can u make blue less stupid this shit is ass
Captain price in a nutshell
Wait blue is a imposter because imposter can not kill imposter unless they get voted out
Are they blind purple is holding a gun
I bet episode 3 will have 3 imposters lol
This video is among us logic
Why is the girl always out first :|
more
I Actully have the same hat of purple
Oh c'mon! I wanted the girl to last longer even tho she was cyan. I am literally always the only girl in a game and I wanted the girl to last longer than I do in games
The way purple pulls out the gun
Makin bank off of something that’s a big game  Trash video
I think this one wasn’t much fun as the first one, be sure to include more memes in Part 3 Please.
Green dies every time bro
The wired thing is red and blue is a grate duo but now he stoped saying red so next porb white hit a like if u think but red will aways be by him .
YES PART 2 3 PLZ
Never clicked faster in my life.
RIP RED RIP
I'm getting flashbacks of COD listening to purple..
I liked the first one two
there's things that shouldn't exist
The art is to distract the targets with a problem such as a banana in the floor or an overflowing toilet, then pick em off one by one...
Black:he's british Me:what does that have to do with anything (Sarcasm)
next one make it so blue's the imposter then does everything wrong and in front of people and even gets his teamate voted off but then he wins somehow
#Episode3
Part 3 part 3
You know, this feels like the red vs blue of among us.
I can't wait til blue is the imposter and does nothing the whole game. Just sticks by red and watches him to make sure he isnt the imposter. Then everyone gets sus of each other and votes off until blue is the winner with 0 kills.
Its always blue who thinks its red and then at the end he votes the actual imposter
Make one when impostor win plz it would be cool
Episode 3 pls I subbed and liked
Can you make blue as an impostor?? It'll really looks funny please!
"He's British, I don't think we should trust him"  -Black 2020
Can this be like a monthly thing please its do good
Make this a series 😌
Wait they are wearing asternot suits and when they kick them out of the spaceship why do they die if there wearing astronauts suits
Why didn't you keep white blue around maybe she might be useful making a baby you know what I mean
PLEASE KEEP DOING THOSE AMAZING VIDEOS FOR EVER
Once I was playing 2 imposter mode and ppl caught me so I told them the other Imposter and they left when I got ejected lol
"he's british! I don't think we should trust him!"
Blue is really just a Third impostor at this point
*ignores the gun in the middle of the meeting*
Do I hear Apex references?

I like how its always a crewmate win because blue just is an idiot then he just wasn't
proof I was here before this goes viral
"Alright, woah woah woah, let me explain" "He's British? I don't think we should trust him"  America vs Britian (Again)

wow green died first again....
Purple sounds like the right hand man from Henry stickmin
Ugh finally been waiting forever
Lol I'm just like white when I get voted out I say f**** u to everyone lol
4:12  i died
Blue and red are the best combo
This could low key be an actual reality show, and I think it would do pretty well.
OH MY GOD, I LITERALLY HATE IT WHEN THE IMPOSTOR THINKS ITS SMART TO KILL SOMEONE IN PLAIN SIGHT AND BLAME ME WHEN THEY KNOW IM THE OTHER IMPOSTOR. LIKE DUDE-
Purple: *holding a weapon in front of everybody* Everyone: "its everybody except purple!"🤦‍♂️
"Wait what if i am the impostor":bleu 2020
Public lobbies be like...
2:36 damn that crack
Purple: *ITS CYAN I WATCH YOU KILL GREEN.*                Also Purple: *Points a gun in white's face for not listening*
Bro I lost it when he said I like your cut G
We need a complete series of this in TLC

Type in “Society” And imagine Among Us pops up
Pls make Episode 3 for Episode 3 can each person have a pet/dog etc?
Purple: *kills in front of everyone* Blue: “Blue sus”

6:43 my fav part
i love your among us  reality  vids
So this kinda reminds me of the fact that just earlier today, my brother and I decided to play Among Us together. We both wanted to be imposters. We named ourselves IMPASTA and Not Sus and both of us picking the hockey mask. The very first round, I was imposter and he was a crewmate, and just to mess with people, my brother kept telling everyone I was with them and calling everyone accusing me sus. Was so funny because at the end, everyone thought my brother was the imposter and there was only one person left other than us. They called the meeting to discuss and we both voted them out. It was great.
YAY PART 2!
I love how red is still wearing the cowboy hat
I’m laughing so hard right now 😂😂🤣🤣🤣😂 so many of these things are so true 😂
Omg I love blue he’s soo clueless
make a 3rd one where  1: The imposter wins 2: the imposters are blue and red 3: they get a double kill
I'm one of the first!!
"I like ya cut G" 😂😂😂
YES! MORE AMONG US! DO A PART 3!!! btw White disserved to get shot out into space cuz he was the imposter last time!
I'm surprised blue didn't say "red sus, I think he faked his death!"
I WANT MORE
You idiots it’s purple
every one gangster until blue snitches on you
Come one guys, it’s clearly Blue
Yess

6:11   Is purple imitating  Captain Price when he said “don’t worry we’ll get’em next time”?
Purple quoted thanos. Thanos is purple Coincidence? *I think not*
When white voted orange and had like a seizure that was funny
This video a very stupid
This is the only reality show I've liked
Wow
Blue is the hero we need, but not the one we deserve
i think its red.
I think Blue is my favorite one in this
"I like your cut g" *door closes* Me: lmao

Red and blue should be impostor then blue keeps saying that he thinks it’s red then they eject red and it was red then blue wins cos everyone thinks he’s clear cos he ejected red

And who knew blue would save the day
I liek ya cut G
They have space suits so why can't they Breathe  if thare Ejected
Noice
Blue, the one character everyone loves
:0
We needed this
Since the replies are full I’d like to see the impostors be unknown until the end, and only have it say they’ve been ejected
Blue is so stupid
They said it couldn't get worst  It just got worst
Why does it always come down to blue?
Blue is always sus on red
LLike if u love blue
These are so well done
Agghhh it hurts that there are ppl like blue ;-;
Once I played this game: cyan killed in front of everyone, I reported it and no one believed me, then after they skipped the vote and I was doing tasks... cyan killed me
So true this is almost every two imposter game I play also make part 3 plz
I want to see that in netflix
episode 3 pls i love these episodes
Nobody gonna talk about purple saying I like your cut g
I don’t believe in astrology; I’m a Sagittarius and we’re skeptical
I want an entire series of this
😯😯😯😯😯😯🤫
Do number 3 plis. Y like. your are the best of the amongus reality show the best.☺
Plot twist blue is actually the imposter just forgot how to play and purple is hacking
Blue is the best character by far and purple 2😁
Who was waiting for a part two
The tv says ASUS this time XD
RTX off: just normal meme. RTX on: 6:39

Next episode: Blue dies
I was waiting for this.  I'll edit this after I watch the video  Edit: that was funny af but now they gotta do a part 3 with 3 imposters
Purple sound like captain price
Do 3 man
purple reminds me of the dude from the meg especially when he said “there’s 2”
YES! PLEASE PART THREE
Honestly this is really cringy especially when they say “sus” instead of suspicious but it is really entertaining, I enjoy this!
2 minutes and 40 seconds in Im pissed The first video was perfect and accurate This is a fucking clown show. This aint among us. Not good.
Blue is the best
Listen to ORNGE
bruh, i allways pick random collor to blame on when im the imposter
Now we need part 3
Epic
do something about the audio(the space suit filter hurts the ear)
I love blue because he’s SO stupid
I like ur cut g
Should have been named when captain Price plays amoung us
The dark green die first in the 2 parts 🤣😂🤣😂
Purple: sometime the hardest choice requires the strongest well Ironically his colour is purple likewise thanos lol
Episode 1: one imposter Episode 2: two imposters Episode 3:three imposters Episode 4:four imposters Episode 5:five imposters Episode 6:six imposters Episode 7: seven imposters Episode 8: eight imposters Episode 9: nine imposters Episode 10:ten imposters
Purple sounds like price from cod
Please make a episode 3 and 4
Pls do part 3
This is something to laugh for even though I still have problems.
A random color: “they’re sus” Everyone: *”Yeah totally sus”* *”Agreed”*  *”Yeah, you have a point”*
I want episode 3 me me me I want it
*Please make a series of this! 😃*
Yay finally

Rip red
0:32 EASTER EGG WALK ANIMATION

Blue kinda sus, he keeps finding bodies
Black doin wires like normal
Is it just me and my brother or does purple voice remind me of the right hand man from Henry stickmin
Purple guy
They vote the girl out again first no simps here😂
Why does purple sound like captain price
Blue you can’t just vote yourself
Ha ha love this series so much subbed and liked plz keep it up
Cringe
Blue and red my favorite duo
Is it just me or is it always up to blue to vote the final vote
Blue HAS to be impostor next time
Can you post more plz
I like how green always died first and that girl(cyan) and black always knew the imposter lol
Dislikes are from the fall guy beans
I hate when my imposter teammate votes and betrays me
Red and Blue are my Favorite characters.
Hmm, Blue be pretty sus doe
Do more please I love it!!!!
orange is mad sus
At 1:08 Purple said there were 2 Imposters so one is purple who the the other one???
Red sus hahahahaha😆😂

When black vouched for white but then still voted him off...
Amazing AND WHY RED?!?!?
Red is such a mood
My favorite blue.Hero blue!
Yes
Petition to Turn this into a show
Gotta do blue as a Imposter
XD I was laughing at 2:04 then laugh harder on 2:07
Bad
Dam
The first one is better
Purple’s that racial jack ass British survivalist stereotype, but just in Space
No
More of this series, its great
I think its meee
2:33 Purple revealed his gun but everbody standing there is blind i guess😂😂🤣🤣
This video is actually funny 😂
I love that it always comes down to Blue. Every. Time.
Episode 1: “I think it’s red” Episode 2: “I think it’s me”
Make the imposter win in episode 3
Blue: guys I think I killed him  The crew: oh no! ...:anyway
why is black back he died
audio is super clipped btw
Ok what
OMG YES PRT 2 FINALLYYYY
*Purple* : How can I lose to idiots who threw their own friends out of the ship ? Also *Purple throwing cyan under the bus*
Yes
The last 1 was up 2 blue aswell
how come blue always ends up saving the day lol
w0w
Why does the girl always get voted off first? That's what I wanna know 🤔
I was waiting for this and i would live for a never ending series 😂
Why is the girl always voted out first
Welcome to another among us video where girls dont last even 3 minutes
In the next one make red and blue impostors
If you don't like this comment  santa Claus will deliver coal this Christmas
PLEASE EPISODE 3
Reminds of a game i was in that had two impostors... there was a crisis at electrical... it finished before i got there but saw lime and cyan walk out of there... i go check in the back and find BOTH green and red ded... report... explain to people the whole deal... lime claims he was on reactor with cyan... cyan backed it... and people actually voted me out on the grounds that i had to be lying (therefore, impostor) since LIME's claim was backed by someone (CYAN)...
I saw prpl there and MAKE PRT 3 PLZPLZPLZPLZPLZPLZPLZPLZPLZ
Sick
Me when I'm desperate to make it to my bus even though it's already out of the station: 0:32
I love this series
blue is literally me on my 1st game in
Yesssss part 333
Purple:I like you cut g Me:Nice
Is it weird that cyan is called cyan but it's actually teal
Price “purple” is very secretive
good fruit good
YESSSS
Blue guy always makes the right decision at the end haha.
"I think this purple guy's great."  Orange is sus, Purple guy kills.
I like how purple says I like your cut g
Nobody:  Not even a single soul:   blue:I am the impostor and I just dont know it.I am going to try to jump in vent
Oh yeah
lol
Blue is always the one making the big decision in these lmao
british guy : *exists*  Everyone : *hippity hoppity you being voted out the ship is now my property*
Pokm
I love the new hats 😄
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Yes I was waiting for part 2!
Blue clutch
Perfect
as always blue saved the day
YESSS
Episode 3 pls
Only people who watched part 1 can like
Uhhh
Let me guess next time will be 3 imposters
Great vid! Now I'm waiting for part 3 😁🤣
Purple sound like a combination of ghost and price
4:06 p u r p l e g u y
Part 3?
Cyan: the imposter that never kills  Blue: noob\idiot \me  Orange: fake detective\smart detective  White: usually the normal crewmate  Purple: the imposter with guts| sometimes kills INFRONT of cams or people  Lime: the one who always dies first  Black: the quite one Red: mager task man/ gets angy realy quickly
The not so subtle fact that purple is captain price.
MEDBAYYYYYY!
Blue is annoyingly dumb
All I want for Episode 3 is the average game with randoms. Basically,  Emergency Meeting "red sus" _"ok"_ *_"ok"_* *"wait"*  Red was not The Impostor. 1 Impostor remains.
Reds finally doing his tasks
"I think PuRpLe GuY is good" Me: (͡°͜ʖ͡°) oh isn't he-
Gg blu
The Man Behind The Slaughter
Hello
Purple sounds like the meme from the game where when you fail the guy says "Mission failed. We'll get em next time" heres proof 6:11
purple sounds like sus but sounds like MARKIPLIER too
That is the shittest British accent I have ever heard
I bet in the 3rd one blue is imposter and that he's actually got 999999iq
The long awaited sequel we were waiting for.
The last scene tho😭😂💔   *I think it's mey*
Last episode it said samsus on tv logo now it says asus 😂
i love among us
Purple: *runs from body* Orange: have you seen anyone? Blue: nah didn't see anyone
I like ya cut g AAAAA
Nobody:  Random crewmate doing nothing but existing  That random guy:S U S
Episode 3
Not hot
The best of the best 😂
wait why is blue's spacesuit ripped and why is he wearing it if it's ripped  come to think of it, why do they suffocate if they're wearing spacesuits in the first place? probably because they're not even spacesuits to begin with - then why are they wearing them...
I truly like this
nobody had the pink flamingo :(
purple gave it away at the beginning when he said there were 2 impostors. how would purple know that there were two impostors unless he was one of them? I knew it was purple right from the start.
Among us is just so........😂
i hate women
Nobody's talking about how the girl is always the first voted out in these..
Make 3 plz
I am really enjoying these
Yes
why did purple make so many ghost references?
is every one going to ignore the fact that purple sounds like captain price
But he said 2 so blue dose not know he is the last imposer
Who could've guessed that the man in the purple suit would be behind the slaughter
I feel like I'm cyan being blamed on for a murder😂😥😂😅😂
n o w  t h i s  e p i c
Whoever is acting as blue is a great actor because I genuinely hate the character 😂
Nobody talking about the "don't worry we'll get them next time" reference to call of duty
Makes sense its purple whos imposter he is the man behind the slaughter
We have finally gotten episode 2, this should just become a series
This is pretty accurate, the impostor losing to pure luck
And always green dies
He was holding a gun it was so obvious
Blue needs help trusting not only others, but also himself
Cool
It’s always up to blue.
My favorite through all of them is blue. And the girls don't live to the end
i want ep 3
It is so much fun
this is not as good as the first one
stop kussing please
6:43 I don’t ever think I’ve heard a British person say “I like ya cut, g” but I’m glad I saw it in this video. Also the Taco Bell sound made it 10x better lmao
Next video should be with Blue being an impostor and actually winning the game
Next episode blue should be the imposter And also there should 3 imposters
Goo shit
Dark blue is so funny hahahaha make more plzzz😭😭😭😭😭😂😂😂😂😂
I'm can't be the only one that got that   6:10
Always purple sua
Make blue imposter next time 😂😂
MOOOOOOOOOORE
this channel is sexist, they always votes out the girls
LES .GO.
Purp: omae wa mou shindeiru Black: NANI!?!! Purp: i like ya cut g
Blue is smartest crewmate in the world
Red and dark blue is the best
The crewmates who spent their butts off to do this job: *10 years of academy training wasted*
I feel so sad the girl dies first everytime:(
reisler 2.ciyi çekmiş
???????????  Is what I type when someone instantly presses the emergency button
Reality TV Or Power Rangers
Blue is so pressed
4:09 I feel the exact way red
CYAN WITH THE WET FLOOR SIGN IS MY CHARACTER DNDNSNSH
You should do next on a different map
Stupid guy is the only person to win
*RED* *SUS*
Do another one
why does green die frist
I also want to play it
.
Here before youtubers get your ticket here  👇
LOL cause of these things i want to subscribe

Stop being harsh at the girls
Cool
Red defines who I am in among us
Nice Billy Butcher impression by Purple

Purple killed right in front of blue what the frickk
Ep 3 should have the imposter win
Blue is the best part
Amazing!
YAYAYAYYA LUUUV UUU BROOO
*Red is a mood.*

Would love to see a mini crew member episode. Their parent gets thrown out and then they just sit there lol.

Plz keep this going I love it
Purple:dont worry we'll get him next time Me:sounds like something from a call of duty game
Blue sus.. he always make it out of live

Blue was playing dumb this whole time so that when he's imposter in the next episode, nobody believes it.
I love blue this so funny XD
Blue is my favorite
Yeah it's back

Lmao, imagine if blue voted himself out.

А то шо фиолетовый достал пистолет, никого не напрягло 😅😂
Blue should’ve voted for orange at the end lol
It always comes down to blue.
Here before 160k views. Claim your ticket now
You should make it so in episode 3 at the end blue doesnt vote so its a tie and then the impostor keeps venting in front of the other logical crewmate lmao
A quote from black "he's British, I dont think we can trust him" 0:45
Yessir

ok but purple is 7th crewmate for blaming cyan.
I fucking love blue
Could we see ghosts plz
Please make more! We love these!
Blue stupid
i love that blue is always the tiebreaker
Orange: “you wanna know what I think?”  Everyone: no not really

Blue is a whole mood
Blue has got to be my favorite

Wait if blue isn't that smart how is he an astronaut.
White: THATS THE STUPIDEST ACCUSATION I'VE EVER HEARD! Also White: THAT'S THE STUPIDEST ACCUSATION I'VE EVER HEARD!
This is my favorite show
I absolutely hate getting voted out as an imposter even though you did nothing
I want blue to be the imposter next game
Please make a part 3 I love this series soooooo much it’s fantastic
Hopefully this isn’t cringe like the first one
"ALL RIGHT HERE'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO" taps gun to other's head
I think blue should be the next imposter and win
I’d love to see a video where red and blue are the imposters.
Is purple captain price
Blue is so dumb he's literally a genius. He's dumb all throughout and the imposters never kill him so they have a chance to win his vote. Then, Blue pulls the ultimate gamer move 👀👌💙
Blue was the impostor
Red always kinda sus
Part one was better.no offense but great job :)
why is nobody talking about the cod mw references from purple?  they’re legendary
Welp the games gona die faster now
The conflict with blue in these last two Among Us videos
I think episode 3 is going to be with 3 imposters.
when theres 2 imposter and on of them betrays the other
L o l
I love this
Blue always clutches it up
I like your cut g LlllllllllllllllllloooooooooooooolllllllllllllllllL
you know what purple needs, is a cup of tea
I would love to see blue as an imposter
Well episode 3 must be blue and as always he says red.at last he will win. Thats going to be cool.because nobody suspects blue
Bro i was waiting for it lets gooo
Purple, literally killing green infront of all:  Blue: *red sus.*
this needs to be a YouTube series
Blue and red need to be imposters one episode
Use this comment as a petition for Episode 3
EP 3 PLSSSS
How you got captain price on your channel
Evolution from I think it is red to I think it is me
Another episode? I thought it would be a one and done I'm glad to see more! Keep up the good work.
Blue would be best imposter imo
When he said "I like yo cut g" 😂😂😂
daym boy
...
Black: Purple is British, I don't trust him Me, who is British: *i beg your pardon?*
Purple made me think.of cpt price
Green sus

Best channel ever 😂
I love how green has dum om his face
Purple sounds like Ghost of mw
The red and blue rivalry from last time is still going

Blue should sus some one and it would actually be them but no one believes him
I was vibing at wires
First
Got that astro physicist Weasel vibes from Ice Age_"That's the stupidest thingh I have ever heard" 😂
Nice
Can we have an episode where blue is the impostor or the impostor wins?
Please make episode 3 and they will be 3 imposters    Anyone agree?
Finally cyan is a woman !!!! Yesss
i was playing among us while watching your vid at 4:30 your oxygen was depleted and in my game also oxygen was depleted what a coincidence
this is awesome you need to do part 3
Maybe there could be a season 3 and 2 in Mira HQ and polus
Nice  i just found this channel at random
Orange:I think it's white Purple:*literally pointing a gun at him*
I'd love to point out everybody was sus of purple just because he was a brit
episode @@

This makes me laugh 😂
Why is captian price in a purple space suit
Among us rule #1: vote the women out first
Why does the girl always get voted off
More one like to this comment = Blue is more dumb... 👇
2:35 "you're gonna vote cyYAAAAAAAAn off"
Orange: You wanna know what I think... Everyone: No not really
Yay
I literally love this
Finally I was waiting for this
every purple  in among us is basically william afton
FINALLY PART 2
You should implement the ghosts
Purple is butcher from The Boys?
Is this supposed to be people playing the game since black white orange and green miraculously came back to life
Purple is a bad teammate
"I think this purple guy's great!" Fnaf fans: *intense sweating*
But blue is my favorite
6:43 *I like ya cut g* .. thats so original-
Blue still thinks it’s red
Yes Episode 2
This is wholesome
Blue is my overall favorite💙💙

Mom: So What's your favorite TV show? Me: Ermmm its complicated
And your medbaydhffhxtjfj

Blue and black are the best in the video as a crewmate and purple is just amazing
Just cause he's British why do u do the stupif language bro. It's bs g
Lol that’s all i have to say
GOD I LOVE THIS STUFF
Only if they knew...
Heyyy
Sounds like captain price/ghosts voice actor
Black: "I fear no man...but that thing." *wires* "It scares me"
3:38 the new skip vote.... Vote yourself 🤣🤣🤣
If you do a third episode I would like to see blue become the imposter it would be hilarious
In the next part there should be a russian guy I think it would be more funnier
The unsung Hero is Blue who's constantly confused...
EPISODE 3 NOW!!!!!!  LETSSS GOOOO SOOO GOOO SERIES
I  actually rrreeallly want the I think its red merch like sooo badly
Make a third episode please and add more people and colors and cool places and add another imposter that means 3 imposter
Blue only get smart at the end of the round
I love this series
I like it, its like cosplay but really funny :D
Purple: I like your cut g Me: VOTE HIM OUT
YAY ANOTHER ONE :D
blue is my favorite
I’m early yay
If Blue was the imposter he would be bad
Another one
"I like ya cut G"
Starts out the same
blue and red, enemies to lovers, 300k slow burn
I knew dark blue would vote the imposter in the end
Do two imposters, but we don't know there's another until the end!
In the end, Blue always says the day.
Reverse blue he is too smart to understand
Yes
yes its back
I relate with White, I've been getting accused so many times as a crewmate lately out of nonsensical excuses
IT’S PURPLE GUY! and he’s even a killer...
1 hour ago....
Everybody gangsta until they realise blue knows karate
I love cyans wet floor hat 🤣🤣🤣
6:42 I LIKE YOU CUT
394830483048403 of out of 10
blue is always the last to make the vote at the end
xDD made my day bro thx for ep 2! Would love to see a ep 3 this series got me subbed to you Also u did the blue thing again xDDDDD i LOVE it
can i have a shout out so i can afford headphones plz
I want more
I love how blue acts dum
I just started watching and I finde it’s very sus that he is the first one to mention that there are 2 impostors, I bet he is one of the impostors
Next of these (If there is one) should be 100% randos and act like how randos do in lobbies.
Episode 3 for sure!
I love how they throw the vents XD
Was waiting for this tbh
Why does he look like he’s having a seizure? 5:59
I love how blue is always the dumbest person throughout the round but at the end always comes through to get victory LOL
This is actually a VR game.
6:41 like ya cut g
Bruh, what if there's an absolute sweetheart as a crewmate and they all immediately vote them off just because they "seem more sus than the rest of them." (Probs be a lime or yellow crewmate)
My strategy is just like purple. Making the other imposter sus so I look less sus because I was right. Guess what. I play as purple, is this a thing purple people do? 🤔
6:43 i like ya cut g
O[ooo9
This is probably my most favorite series ever on YouTube
:D
2:35 that voice crack tho
Purple: i like your cut g Black: wait what?  Close the door  Taco ball ding
I liked how the only crewmate that has iq over 11 looks like a ****** carrot
Dude these sets are unreal
Is no one gonna talk about purples voice crack while holding out the gun
"but what if i the imposter and i just dont know"  😂😂😂
6:09 "don't worry we'll get em next time" CAPTAIN PURP THE GOAT
Adoro esta serie
Love These Shows 🤣👍
Yes
Nice vid
Hell yeah
This is just good
Can we have someone who’s color blind fuck up the whole round and cause the imposters to win
This video will get over 10 million views.     But red is kinda sus!
More tinted helmets
Why green always die first? Poor little guy, he only wanted to play a decent game
it’s the best and back
Thats the best fan among us wideo I’ve ever seen
One day Blue is going to be an impostor and he is going to win because nobody is going to believe that it is him x))
Make a third one with three imposters that would be awesome   Love the video
'i think its me'  - blue
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! HE SHOULD'VE VOTED FOR HIMSELF!   Actually, on second thought, screw purple... blue can do it next time when someone who's less of a cunt plays impostor... like Cyan or Red.
Hi big fan
I LIKE YA CUT G
Now will a stack kill be shown on this? 🤔
More Among us
If part 3 so 3 imposter also please 😆
EPISODE 3 PLEASE
Black: Don't trust him his British  I'm dead🤣🤣😂
I like how blue gains some brain cells when their are only 3 people left.
It's all up to blue alwayd
This could start to become a YouTube original
"I like ya cut G" "Wait Wh-" **doors shut** **b o n g**
keep making things

Purp 30 got the glock in his hand
I think it's red

Purple just sounds like Droz from titanFall 2
I love how the dumbest player can be the smartest near the end of the game

Purple sounds like captain price to me 😂😂 from cod MW
Sempre é o ciano kkkkkk

Blue should be the imposter on episode three
HERE BEFORE 10 MIL VIEWS:)))
I like blue
I really love this what I’m gonna call show
YES
I like how the rest of the teammates are just ignoring the fact that purple has a gun in his hand
*I like your Cut G*
Is purple O'Malley from Red vs Blue?
Blue is the best character, and did nobody think purple is a dangerous colour, I mean Thanos was purple, Will Afton was purple. PURPLE IS A DANGEROUS COLOUR
So is purple like the fnaf purple guy or is he Thanos?
im kinda sus of blue ngl.
I made an Among Us animation   Among us but Crewmate kills mini crewmate  https://youtu.be/C4K6NUUQkLk
Can somebody tell me how to comment
A black and white episode 3
Please make the next episode, Blue being the imposter
Please make green not die
This is so cool! Keep up the good work! Cant wait for Part 3!
Nobody:     Not even the imposters:  Blue: I dunno red stills seems sus
Honesty i think its me
THANKS FOR A NEW VID I LOV THESE VIDS
I was playing among us with my friend and this is what black said “its lime i saw her kill someone” i legit got so mad-.
As soon as I saw Cyan I was like: My colour, let's  see if it's accur- *Cyan gets blamed almost instantly* Ok, it's accurate-
Plot twist, purple was not imposter
Still think it's red
PLEASE MAKE AN EPISODE 3 THESE VIDEOS ARE SO ENTERTAINING AND EVERYONE LOVES THEM! YOU SHOULD GET MORE CREDIT FOR THIS STUFF! PLEASE MAKE A THIRD EPISODE ASAP! thx i love these vids, subbed and liked. 👍🏻👌🏻🙏🏻☺️😊
Yes ep2 I would love pt3
BRUH WHY DOES PURPLE SOUND LIKE CAPTAIN PRICE?!  THERE EVEN WAS A CLEAR COD REFERENCE IN THERE LIKE WTF
The crewmates are stupid!!!
The black one allways do elictecity task mach the veryers
Heres what i think you should put in the third episode: There should be 2 imposters, there should be one who accuses everyone for no reason, someone whos afk next to the body, and someone that is silent when someone asks them something then responds in 10 seconds. Just my thoughts
I can now say amigos from lela ponds is bette r
*Get this comment to 1k So I can let people know I'm early*
If you make third one.... add a mini-crewmate XDD
who else wants this to become a series?
I play detective and was able to know who was the second impostor
Anyone else having problems with the play/pause button on youtube? It keeps growing when I press it. Any fixes?
bro the way purple said "don't worry we'll get him next time" reminded me of the good old days
I think I need to react to episode 1 and 2 for a youtube video!
T-SHIRT: EXISTS ME: I don’t need it....I don’t need it....I DEFINITELY don’t need it....I don’t need it I don’t need it.........IIIII NEEEEED IIIIIITT
Yes I’d love a episode 3
This should be a netflix show
veri good video
I feel bad for anyone who’s green. They always die first
Purple is imposter
Purple: I like ya cut g         Me: PFFFFT OMl
Blue=big brain
But Mira HQ isn't in space
Yessir
Last time it was white and now it’s pupurle what’s gonna be next orange?
I was waiting for part 2 yaaaa ia m so extited to see now i am going to the video yuuhoooo
Let's wait until the episode 3 will be released 😂
Twist: There Was 3 Impostors 🍊 was 3rd impostor
Yes it’s back! This show is the only reality show I will ever watch!
Blue is the best...!
Now I realize how dumb everyone is when the imposter kills in front them because they r stacked
why is blue always alive?
Blue reminds me of Donald Trump, and idk why
Lol
Purple: I like your cut black Black : huh  TACO BELL SOUND
Purple holding a gun: it's not me Everyone: ok
For some reason I think of colorblind people when I play among us
YES!! We need part 3
Episode 3 plzzzzzzz😀😀😀😀
HAHAHA-Hahaha.. ya know all of u sus.
Ok so you went from Samsus too Asus?
I LiKe uR cUT g
Guys, I don’t really like the ending. It’s the same as last time and it feels lazy. I think it would be more realistic when 3 imposters are on the ship  the imposters win
nice stack kill
Yes finally I’ve been waiting for this
STOP SAYING IT,S YOUR SElF
1:10 *tries to tableflip.png* *fails*
DOPE
Blue would be the player that says: "wait why r my and purple's names red"
Plot twist       Purpul was not the imposter
Yes please a part 3
I fucking love this xD
"I like your cut g" that was when I exploded bruh
This exact thing happened to me yesterday :(
A dislike? Hmm...            I think it's red.
I want an episode 3
Man this is awesome get in touch with Netflix turn this into a actual show
Im getting some halo red vs blue vibes from this idk why.
I hate how accurate this is
why the girls die first? :(
who would like some wisdom?
funny how astronauts in a spaceship who probably studied for 4 years to get to where they are now use the word "sus"
Hecl ya spsoside 3 would be sick!
I still think it's red thb
10000000000000000000000Q
Purple sounds like cap price
Part 3 pls this is super super fun
@6:46 was that the Taco Bell sound?? Lmao

10000000000000000000000Q
This is funny
ngl I spent a good 3/4 of the video wondering if blue was high

No matter what happens, if a third happens blue MUST survive.
A loik ya cut, G
This among us reality show is WAY better than the original  game
YEEESSSS, EPISODE 2 LETS GOOO

the British guy reminds me of bear Grylls
Blue is the dumbest but is a hero
Is this the same map as the last one
Ur the best
(:
I was hosting a game and one of you guys wanted to be ejected as fast as possible, so I told you to call an emergency meeting and ask if Shrek can take on Thanos. (I was the red crewmate, Lutharius)
I honestly love this 😂❤️
Yay part 2 thats nice
Blue is that one dumb crewmate
I want black to be imposter
Guys, Blue is the hero again!

Blue is dumb as ever same old him
Finally !
There stupid cyan was my fav I hate you I’m depressed my cousin is going be sad
Dark green has the same outfit but without the green skin that I use xd I’m dum *b*
Why is it always a girl who get voted out first. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Lol I love these
I wonder what will happen when blue is actually the imposter..
Sick
They should make this into a series
The 3 episode should have 3 imposters
Blue be like: Agh... huh? uhm Red sus
awesome
Why does Purple sound like Captain Price lmao
Wait how were they still voting with 3 players left?
Purple voice pitched
EPISODE 3 PLSS
The worst part is that this actually happens  Ig of course
I was about to go watch Hulu then I saw this and I was like nvm
Purple: "It doesn't make any sense at all. It would only make sense if you're a complete idiot."  Also Purple: *forgets that Blue is a complete idiot*
Dope shirt at the end.
OMG! DID YOU ACTUALLY KILL HIM
Hi again

He’s British and says”I like your cut g” that’s nice
yesss part 2 boiiiiis
I love how blue has to be convinced that its not him 🤣
Blue is for sure the imposter

BLUE IS THE KING OF CLUTCH! But also an idiot...
BLUE CLUTCHED IT UP AGAIN
I love how purple used a thanos quote, such a missed man behind the slaughter chance tho
Is blue from so random
This is the closest thing were gonna get to an among us show on netflix
this is awesome, keep up the great work!!! :)
please make more of this!
Red: Done with Blue's shit Blue: The fool Purple: The smart British guy Green: Always dies first Black: Chill normal guy White: Angry normal guy Orange: Accusatory normal guy Cyan/Pink: The girls  Brown, Yellow, Lime: Yet to be added
I was expecting Blue to vote orange

I like your cut g 6:42
This needs to be a weekly series.
Early but an hour late
Make one of them have the chef hat next
I like your cut G. British Version
I can't believe that Purple did "I like ya cut, g" to Black.
Next time someone should call a vote at the beginning for no reason
Red and Blue are y fav characters because they just argue al the time LMAO
i was hopping that in disguise blue was the imposter all along
Yesss
why green allways die first
You should make one where the imposters win...
Ngl orange kinda sus
This actually how it be
noone comented about "SAMSUS" TV.
Blue always gets the deciding vote, 1st he was random voting red the whole game when he voted white at the end. Then this one he just random voted himself lol
i subbed just bcs this series
*Literally 99% won’t see this: Your amazing and wonderful stay safe during this rough times have a amazing weekend 😍🥰*
There’s gonna be 3 impostors next episode of this
Blue is my favourite character by far please make a part 3
Blue must be the imposter
Blue is honestly a survivor having made the deciding vote twice! And bieng alive at the end of both episode
*Literally 99% won’t see this: Your amazing and wonderful stay safe during this rough times have a amazing weekend 🥰*
I hope we get a 3rd one please 😂
I love blue I like where he gets so confused then at the end he makes the right choice
I guess episode 3 equals three imposters
Part 3
EPISODE 3
Why purple is always a meme  crewmate/impostor
Mini crewmate
Why has the firat one to die in the first 2
Lol people sounds like a British character from call of duty
We want episode 3 these are so well made
Part 2 is out lest goo can you make part 3 please
6:43 BIGGEST TURN YET LOL
YES PART 2!!!
Captain Price agreed to be in this video it’s crazy
Синий мой любимый персонаж, просто бог. 👁️👁️
Who else thought of captain price was purple
New character for 3rd episode    Yellow: sarcastic , sensible and kind   Lime: Insane, ramdom and childish
Purple sounded like ghost from modern warfare and said some lines   that made me remind  of ghost
I want to have a red to my blue
I LOVED the first one oh yea

The hero is always blue
New subscriber! This content is hilarious lmao EPISODE 3 PLEASE

Funny
Everybody is talking about how "He's a British we can't trust him" is funny, but nobody talks about how he is Australian, not British?
if u  press the like button you want episode  3          You just pressed the meeting button, your now sus!
Lol
You don't know how fast I clicked when I saw this. It did not disappoint.
If an episode 3 happens, I hope you guys spice it up and change the scenery. Base it on one of the other maps, the main one has been used to death in Among Us skits. So could you please do that for a third part?
I love it make episode 3
Yes
I love blue he is the greatest
Blue really sounding like a henchman
Everybody gangsta until purple was pulls out the nine.
This is like public Among Us lobbies in a nutshell
I could watch 'n' number of parts of this "Among Us but a Reality Show" series!
Wow good job updating the game
Yes! This is exactly what I need
I hope green dying first will be a running gag lol
Is that the voice actor of captain price?
oh yea boi            ep 3 pls
Purple is like the one guy that actually has a brain in the randoms
Let’s go another one I love this
2:36 that voice crack tho 😂😂😂😂😂
Off topic, but a few months ago I took an initiative to   *Read More*
If your favourite character isn’t blue then.... Where???
Finaly
Bruh purple killed green in front of y'all
THE purple guy is the imposter lol
Love it
Black: STRANGE
"Sometimes the best place to hide a body is in plain sight" -*captain price 2020*
As thanos once said: The hardest choices require the strongest Wills
5:59 When you have a stroke from your teams stupidity
I love how we have captain price as purple
YES!
Want part 3 also guys but try to make it more interesting 👍
Accurate.
That stack kill was amazing
I need part 3
6:43 hey i said that on stream once and they said they used it in this skit lol
I mean in the beginning purple killed someone in front of everyone and they thought it was cyan??
Imagine debating whether or not to vote out yourself 😆
Everyone is trying to solve the mystery and blue and Red are just chilling.
Purple does seem pretty sus
I HAVE WAITED FOR THIS
Blue has to be the imposter
I just wanna slap blue so hare
Third one would be epic
Next video there should be three imposters
Im absolutely loving these!! Everyone is so great with their own personalities and seems like everyone is having a  blast! Cant wait to see more!!!
Who made the dead bodies
Next ep. you really need to put a brown in there with a plant on her head                                                                   🌱 Because I’m the brown potato 👋🏽( [´ ▽ `] )     *pretty please? For me?*
I realized how good of a tactic that is-
I LIKE UR CUT G
Yes please ep 3

Who else got CALL OF DUTY vibes when purple  said “don’t worry we’ll get’em next time” in a British accent ?  EDIT: THX FOR LIKES GUYS  EDIT 2: TIMELAPSE 6:10

4:48 Me every time I get killed when I’ve been staying within plain sight of others

Purple is just captin price, british gang
Blue is my favorite out of these episodes so far😂😂
This is hilarious 🤣
Omg It’s soooo coool u guys are the best
When will this be on Netflix?
That's kind of sus
Finally some good content
*Dang* the production value skyrocketed for this episode. May I make a suggestion? I understand putting a high pass filter on their voices because they are in spacesuits, but without bass, it becomes hard to listen to. Perhaps loosening the filter some could help? I dunno, I was not there when it was being made haha.
Purple is CORPSE.
Quality contant
YES WE WANT EPISODE 3 I LOVE THESE VIDS
Blue is the best 😂
Am i the only one obsssessed with this?
whoever played white you did a great job especially when you got voted off-
Yess EPISODE 2 LETS GOOOOOOO.LIKE IF U WANT EPISODE 3 GUYS
That handshake they tried to do (when they voted out Purple) is what I call "Corona Handshake" you dont touch at all
Blue 200 IQ 😂😁😁
Imagine it said purple wasnt the impostor
Among us should be like this
And what about the second imposter
We want episode 3
Hiii
Purple: i like your cut G 🤣🤣💀💀
Idk guys, Blue kinda sus  But in all honesty, I love this! XD
Why is green always the first one to die
Pls do this again this is the best
I like your cut g -purple 2020
If you make a part 3, when someone dies who should put them in a ghost costume of there color
Yesss
I LIKE YA CUT G

Nobody:  Blue: I vote myself I think I killed him
He sounds like captain price
Yooo this is pog
Love this series keep up the good work meack the inposters win som times
Who is the imposter? Meanwhile: Purple has a gun xD
YES IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
White is too sus
Legend has it...From now red is still sus
I was hoping they'd make a sequal
5:53 I DIED PLEASE MAKE A PART 3
Purple was the man behind the slaughter
Purple pulled out the nine
yay theres a new ting
Episode 2 is way better than episode 1 because I love purple kill green and everyone like wtf. No one vote purple and it so hilarious. Love it
Can you do a part 3
sus
Their relationships give me RvB vibes.              Time to wait for an action packed show about idiotic spacemen.
i lovE THis stuFf
Thes among us guys is dumb who is near the body he is imposter
i love that blue is supposed to be the dumbest one but is really the smartest when it matters
Purple you -
by the logic, the third part will be with, sadly, 3 impostors
Blue: Guys, I think it's me   I can't 😂😂😂
Love it
I'm almost dark green with the dumb sticky notes when I play amoug us
Next map is polus
2:02 stack kill logic xD
Here is the next idea 3 imposter for Ep 3
Blue i think its me... Man how stupid is he
Why is it always down to blue 😂
What if for Episode 3... Blue was acting stupid all along when in fact he was biding his time when he became an imposster.
how does blue always clutch
Thats what i waited for
"I like ur cut, g." Made me laugh so hard
Why is green always the 1st one
3 impostors on Mira HQ
Language
Hey a second one, yes!
Haha
I WAS LOOKING FOR THIS
This guy is gonna become famous this is so entertaining
If you like this your before 100000k views
Bro, blue is sus, he was breathing!!!

Purple guy is the man behind the slaughter 😱😱😱😱😱😱
Blue: guys i think is me! xD
We want a third episode .
the fact that the same day i started watching yall the same day this video was posted
"He's british I don't think wr can trust him" NO WONDER IN NEVER TRUSTED WOW OK
2:04 when someone makes fun of you

Nobody: Blue: 6:35 tries to vent
I just got done playing among us and there was one game where I could to tasks and be the imposter that was super weird

Oh gosh early hai
Blue is the best
Smart imposter
Great job i really love this its so coooooool
E
Color blind people in this game be like :👁👄👁
I should act like blue when I play among us.
3 imposters in episode 3
6:20 that's the best line ever
Among us but it’s a reality show... episode 236 coming soon
I absolutely love this content, it's very enjoyable! Since Halloween is around the corner, I'm sure a lot of people are going to want to dress up as crewmates. Could you make a video running through what you used and where you got your supplies?
White: FINE I GET NOW MORJORTY RULE HU WELL **** U, **** U, **** U AND YOU'RE ****ING MED BASFBAESfbANBFEGA (chocking to death while floating in space.) White was not An Impostor. Me: Dieing hard while laughing
Can I use your video for my channel in a react video?
Fnaf fans : OFC PURPLE IS IMPOSTER HES PURPLE GUY Among us fans : luck
Hahahaha bedst film ever😂😂😂
i love blue 😂😂😂
Purple: And thanos was the one who said that. Hey when you think about what colour thanos skin coulor is and purple's personality, this video becomes a lot more sense
At the end, blue always comes to his senses.
YESS Ive been waiting for this!
omg please make a part 3 but where the imposter wins
5:59  White Had A Seizure
poggers new among us reality show
Blue is my spirit animal
When he said i like ur cut g and put the taco bell sound
54 minutes ago noice
I was hoping for this
Purple is basically Capitan Price
Bruh people over use "sus" so much now a days, justing hearing it is cringe. Plus everyone always thinks anything is always suspicious.
No body  Green:I always die first
i still think its red
I like how everybody is ignoring the fact that Blue said he might have accidentally killed Red
Once again, it’s up to blue to save the day
Pls blue is the imposter
I hate to break it to you, but purples accent isnt British.
What's next 3 Imposters????
Purple is price from cod MW
:(
Episode 3 of this should have 3 imposters or one of the ether maps
Now next part is 3 impostors
Pretty cool

this should be a continued series
Bro i remember watching minecraft vs fortnite 1 year ago love these videos tbh
1:35   I LIKE THAT PLAN  PURPLE IS GREAT   That sticky note explains it all
This was hard to watch when they voted for each other
Black stop doing wires ur gonna keep getting hurt
YESSSSSSS
Dwayne n Jazz HAVE to react to this!
No one: Literally No one: Blue: ehh huh uuh eh?
It was just like the 1st one final desicion is up to blue just like the first AND black was also the first one to hit the emergency button just like the first. ITS JUST LIKE THE FIRST ONE (sorry for spoilers)
I like blue so much 🤣🤣🤣
I like how purple pulled his gun out in front of everyone and no one cared
The man behind the slaughter
Please make this real
Love your video's!!!<3
6:11 MISSION FAILED. WE'LL GET EM NEXT TIME.
1:05   White lost his shit the second he said 2 imposters

I love the fact that purple is *actually* Captain Price.
Red and blue are awesome
among us but its modern family but its intense
Wait orange died and he still lives?
Captain price let's do this
When you make part 1 and then make part 2 to take advantage of the money haha 😂
who came here from infinity?
Im here
Plot twist: blue was the third imposter
Blue is a great person xD
Never clicked on a video so fast in my life Edit: Just finished. Who else was hoping blue will actually be an impostor one round
I like your cut g

Love the side comments XD "No, not really" "You're stupid"
The girls get voted out first and green always dies first
You should do minecraft vs roblox vs among us vs fort nite vs fall guys
4.4K likes in 43 minutes wow
This would be cool if there was a public place to do irl amus
Yes make this a series yesss🤓👍
But I'm still wondering if this was irl would there be a kill cooldown and if so why? So the imp can sharpen his blade? Lol
Red sounds like Simmons. IYKYK   ...Simmons, what happened to the rest of red teamz
How can they not know it's 2 imposters the game tells you how many imposters are there..   1:13 Also look at red he is like "wtf" Of staring at blue XD

Let’s all be honest blue is the hero of every episode
Green was the first one dead in both episodes.    Just thought I would point that out
Now curious if there will be a 3rd with 3 imposters
*blue has a point* lets all admit its true
Logic: it’s purple Blue: I think it’s me
Why did you kill orange again!
ngl blue was pretty sus
Blue is the funniest one in the entire group and winds up saving the day in the end
You should make this a tv show
I havent even seen this and I already want and episode 3.  *Or an entire season of among us reality show*
3 episode sounds good
I love how red is all like DEFLECTING.

I ve been waiting for this😀
Yaaaasss
I love the first among us videos
great video
I LOVE THIS COUNTINUE IT
*5:20** Impostor cheeeck*
I like the dum hat
One if after purple got voted out it said 1 imposter remands and then orange looked at blue
I would love a part two!
Who else needs a tutorial for the cosplay? It's the best i've seen so far
Hold up why is black so small
where do i get these astronaunt mask
the blue guy is  my favorite now EDIT: 2:36 was that a voice crack?
YAY PART 2

We can all agree on one fact....            This should be a tv show on netflix
Nice
This is great!
0:50  purple is talking the boys in here😂
I've had to betray the other imposter to not be sus it sucks
Wait i am actully early!
Never ever kill off the blue character he is literally the best 😂😂😂
:)
very gooood
Ok i have this idea where in an episode someone has a mini crewmate but the mini crewmate has a mind of his own and he is the imposter but the person who owns the mini crewmate isn’t
Cyan and purple Were Impostors
how is it always blue the person that depends who is voted out at the end
i love the hat addition
MORE
A second time let’s go
I love these😍
i like how orange is a carrot
Purple: *quotes thanos Also purple: *sacrifices someone he considered an ally for the long game Also also purple: *is purple  _Perfectly balanced as all things should._  (Also GO FOR THE HEAD! ITS HIS WEAKNESS!!!)
pls part 3
Purple the best
FORTNTE VS PUBG THATS WHY WE ALL HERE BOYS
Let’s have an ep3
Omg 2 is out!

Excuse me but... Doesn't purple sound like captain price from COD modern warfare?
Early gang.
you can't make a better meme than among us!!!     ...        Forget what I said, this is art
I hate when I’m imposter with someone else and they rat me out 😤
Yes please
i like how blue guesses every round wrong and gets it right in the last one
This is what we asked for  It’s also what we needed
The question is which among us series is better  This series or among us logic
Omg you hew best videos on youtube
Yes episode 3
Continue don't stop
asa
0:46 "He is British? I dont think we should trust him" LOL
Lol the girl always gets voted out first
I should not be watching this for entertainment 😭
Yes!
Blue: maybe i'm _impostor_
Honestly, I’m satisfied with life rn. Thank you so very much for part two. The saddest part was red’s death cause I like the blue and red combo. I would think a 3rd part would be really cool but please do what’s best for you guys during these hard times!
Ye
YES
That voice crack laughed me up 😂 2:35
Early! I love these I'm da daughter my costume for halloween is among us orange!
BRUH I MADE MY LIFE YALL MADE MY LIFE SO HAPPY I WAS WATING FOR THIS

purple kills someone infront of them and then they act like hes not the imposter seems legit
BLUE IS THE MAIN CHARACTER HE ALWAYS WIN FOR HES TEAMMATE
Blue is fcking dumb... AND I LOVE IT!
