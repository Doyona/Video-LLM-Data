Grealish dive at 1:26.
martin tyler is such a bad commentator its horrendous
Bloody hell, Villa are terrible. Arsenal need to win or draw against City and win against Villa to win the title. COYG.
Cheating They should be relegated 2 divisions, deducted 20 points for each of the last 5 seasons and all league titles taken from them
They shouldn't be in the premier League with all there cheating
Jack Grealish diving against his boyhood club... actually shameless
So if u touch ur own leg and fall is called penalty... interesting🙄
Love how nobody is talking about that dive from Grealish. Imagine if that was Antony... 🤦🏽‍♂
I’ll say even as a Chelsea fan mahrez is very underrated
Was it just me or did the foul look like a clear dive from Grealish to get City their 3rd goal😂😂
never a penalty. He literally tries to get out the way.
HELLO ARSENAL CITYS COMING TO GET YA 🎉
Grealish could’ve gone past his man but would rather play for a foul as always. Overhyped £100mil if I’ve ever seen one
SOTV KRO 😎👍
Cheats ?
Ddd. D. Ddddddddddddd.      O
I feel like every villa fan deserved to boo that grealish muppet yesterday
Financial Cheats, 3 ; AVilla, 1 ;
Grealish's dive and how Arsenal have been repeatedly shafted by referees tells you all you need to know about how corrupt the league is. City will definitely not be punished for their decades of rulebreaking.
Congrats Man City for winning the league
Who said Haaland couldn't create?!
Who’s holding Martin Tyler’s family hostage 😭
Every week teams like City get doggy pens given for them. Teams like Villa never get them. Even when Jack was at Villa, he never got pens for his diving. He got free kicks but never pens. Game is so rigged for the top 6
Crooks. Win buy £ and nothing else. It will be proven. Not 1 charge but over 100.
Arsenal's choke continues, and Man City looking to scalp them this Wednesday night
The walls are closing in on this disgraced club. Tick tock....
Crap penality.
I know it doesn't matter now but Gundogan has to be squaring it at 0:33 surely
Penaltys those days are joke.
Never a pen.
That goalkeeper for Aston Villa is always conceding haha no dancing now 😂😂 lol
Duran shot would have been goal of the season
P
"Trying" to be Gordon Banks says it all about most goalies! 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Bullet header by Rodri and great play by Haaland where some strikers would have tried to force the angle. Difference between a good striker and a great striker.
CHEATchester City cookin those books.
i dont understand how Ramsey didnt even go for a tackle yet its a foul because Grealish created the contact? also love when he did that for Villa it was never a pen top 6 bias
Dear Spirit of the Universe of all things nice. Many a people don't even consider the possibility that you are even in the oxygen they breath. Taking things for granted - To underestimate or undervalue someone or something; to not properly recognize or appreciate someone or something.  I know that Valentines day is a special day for you as its all about love, red, flowers. I know Manchester City play on Wednesday and your red heart will be all over Arsenal for City. We hope to make the next day after your special day a day for you to remember.  I know you Love  Cats.. In the next life they will be vegetarian and graze on Bananas.
Grealish hanging his leg out to make it look like he got tripped up did it in his last game too
Mahrez nicking my fpl points fgs
The villa goal keeper is terrible
There's something really bleak about Grealish diving to win a penalty when 2-0 up against his own club
Have Mahrez and Alvarez in my fantasy team... pain...
How man city can say others get var decisions and help from the ref is the most laughable statement in the history of football when you see the decisions that go for them game in game out. That was never a penalty. Not only that the constant cheating ,breaking every financial rule and if found guilty should be banned from competing in English football. The most deluded club in football.
Akanji was poor on that 1 on 1. Dias would have made the challenge
Greedy selfish Mahrez glad he missed at the end .
Martinez getting humbled again and again lol
Sick of grealish's jelly legs. A breeze would foul him apparently. Can't wait for city to get relegated
I have no idea why Gundogan is not picked regularly.
That haaland assist was insane
Good effort cheaters, when it's revealed you're guilty and you get all your trophies taken off you, relegated and all history shattered then I'll be happy
Look at that emptyhad
Rooting for Arsenal to reopen the gap - City have bought every trophy they've won in the modern era, and any year they've won the League hass been the worst possible result for the EFL
All this means nothing because every victory has come from cheating. The team only is possible through cheating yet are still allowed to compete. The super league needs to start and weed out the cheating teams like city and Chelsea
Never been a penalty in a million years softest penalty of the season
City out of via HT with 3 goals enable W against Villa whom scored a SH consolation.....
That dive should be in the louvre
That's never a penalty
🇩🇿
VIKING HAALAND 💙
💎R💎O💎D💎R💎I💎
only because you forgot to draw the lines against brentford, absolutely criminal and I'm a united fan. you want to broadcast as the best league in the world with subpar officiating. you claim to show that you're not biased by city by taking them to court but what took you all those years while they were doing it infront of your eyes? so called best league and allowing a team that breaks the rules consistently to win 4 in 5 and you're clearly trying to forge a way into them 3 peating over a wonderful story Arsenal would be. be ashamed, all you clowns care about is money in your pocket, as if it wasn't any enough already. Joke.
Lee Mason celebrated every goal I'm sure.
Does anyone just hate citeh even more now cuz I sure as hell do
Is Grealish the most hated player in the Prem - ever!?!
Come on
Congratulations Arsenal on ur 6months trophy NOW move aside it's over ManC are coming
Mehrez is that player that only seems to score when you're already 2-0 up
Grealishes parents must be so embarrassed for raising a Pansy
Villa should put the kids out against Arsenal
Can’t believe i thought arsenal were winning the league 😅 city are too good man
Grealish is such a diver
Dibu Martinez was brilliant, Aston Villa just couldn''t defend
We will still win the league
Grealish got all the refs wrapped round his finger. Such a soft penalty. He's constantly diving for fouls and penalties. Refs need to stop giving in to his dramatics
The man city pen was ridiculous on par with cheating. This needs called out refs
If City wins next match against Arsenal believe me the league is theirs. Arsenal points dropped in the last two matches were crucial.
Grealish is still practising for the next Olympics then.
Makes no odds come the relegation and point deduction haha 😆 🤣
mahrez=red timing a shot on fifa
Martinez not doing that ridiculous dance😂😂
Haaland was so fast on that second goal. Jesus Christ
Time for Martin Tyler to go
Looks like the last they’ll be playing Villa for a few seasons 💀
I think grelish tripped over his hair band 🤣
Pep rested De Bryne and Gundagon last week as he clearly wants Arteta to win PL. He not interested in PL. He signed new contract only for the CL.
Is the game that soft now that is the standard decision for a penalty what a joke the game is now
Why commentator sounds so uninterested
Before today's match, I've always said I'd love to see Grealish back in a Villa shirt,... But after that dive,and the way he appealed... forget it!!!!...wouldn't want him back now!!!No need to do either of those two things 😤😤
They all earned they're 2nd unofficial pay packets today.
Considering how often Grealish gets his knees hacked away from him each match, I find it hard to imagine how he gets through a match on 2 feet. I find the commentators snide jibe regarding the penalty unjustified.
City will win the title
Marhez would walk in any team in Europe.  I'm a Leicester supporter.  Saka ain't got 🈲️on him . Won more at Leicester than most now. 😅😅😅😅😅😅🙃🙃🙃🙃
Enjoy it why it last, as once your titles are taken away and points taken away your doomed. 😂🤣😁
Villa played well 2nd half
Mahrez is very good
Martinez not doing so well after the world cup 🙉
Ederson made one save. He’s so overrated and city’s weak link. Should’ve easily saved villas goal
It’s like Sterling 😂😂
Easy penalty wtf
What do I want city out  When do I want it now
Man City fans chanting "F the Premier league" really classy stuff from fans who supposedly want to win the very thing they chant F off too. I see the ground emptied well before the final whistle too. I hope the Premier league tells your club to F off from the league for cheating their way to where they are. Plastic soulless club who I would compare to a chav winning the lottery.
Martin Tyler needs to retire…
That was never a penalty too soft In my opinion, Grealish dived and there was not enough contact for a pen stupid decision from the VAR room and ref
Nothing beats the English media,pep was the greatest manager ever to walk the earth.haaland was the Messiah.then they actually dropped points.jeeeeesus get a grip
The fans are so quiet for the goals
Would love a neutral to give me there opinion on the grealish penalty! Personally I can’t believe VAR didn’t overturn it! Lmk your thoughts👍
Tapchester City...
PEP IS GONNA GET YA!!!!
Imagine simulating against the team that brought you up and you spent most of your career at. I don’t understand why Grealish would do that, especially considering city were already 2 goals in front. Really disrespectful
Grealish giving Villa fans a taste of what we all had to suffer when he played for them. It's quite poetic.
Grealish and Tom Daily would make a good couple 😂
Martin Tyler is washed
Why doesn't Pep like pace in his team anymore? Apart from Walker and Alverez... I wish I could get a chance to debate football with Pep! Buy Pulisic Pep!
Sup Jack the diver  Learnt his trade in Aston utv
Halland could have definitely tap it with his longs legs at 0:50
Well if they are found guilty of the charges City might be  playing Morcambe next season! Enjoy it while you can!
Arsenal crumble has begun
Grealish diving against his boyhood club for the penalty you love to see it 🤣🤣
Grealish diving against his former club. Funny way to show respect to your boyhood club that made you a career.
Shouldn’t be 3 points tho, your own standards have come out to say they were significant errors made. It’s like me turning up to work and forgetting I have a uniform to wear. Trust me after the second time I’d be fired yet Lee Mason is keeping his job despite this being a 3rd incident.
2:25 “Oh My Goodness” 😂
0:46 this was great from Haaland, alot players wouldn’t be able to get the pass off like that, top class. 👌
Chambers is stealing a living
There is no way arsenal actually choke the prem from here 😭
City dosen't know that their efforts at the end of the season will be punished🤣😂 no point to ply
It's not that City should be afraid of 115 Premier League charges.  It's that Arsenal should be Very Afraid of what City are Going to Do to Them.  They Will Do Something So Unspeakable Yet So Unforgettable That It Will Live Long in the Memory of all who witnessed it, fans and neutrals alike.
Duran’s strike was Henryesque I can’t lie.
that strike from Duran was almost inhumane! The power, the connection it was so fast, it was unnatural in a sense! Would've been an incredible goal.
Duran is gonna be some player for us 👀
1.00 savage 😱😂
Grealish diving vs Villa 😂
amazing one from dhuran,
League 2 will be some high scoring games next ywsr
It's not looking good bruv 😕
That penalty was a shambolic decision. I hope this lot get the book thrown at them.
It wasn't a pen and that would of changed the match entirely but I ain't bitter they will get their due desserts soon enough. We know what you're, we know what you're Champions of fraudulent activity we know what you're.  It needs work sure but you get the jist.
Grealish tripped over his own leg to get that penelty, diving again hes good at falling over himself.
Gary neville enjoying a city win, 🤔🤔
Man Cheaty
World Cup keeper 😂
Why do we keep letting grealish get away with his obvious dives...
Scores from a pen and misses from 3 yards is not class
They should add "diving" as a Fifa stat 😂
penalty is a joke
Selfish selfish Jack.. even against his boyhood club he dives.. city have killed football on and off the pitch..grealish just part of that jigsaw.
Mahrez ❤
As a Liverpool man well done city 👏don't let arsenal win any trophy inshallah. 👍 let's keep the trophies between us and Newcastle. 😜
Grealish🤦🏻‍♂️
I thought City were going to get 5/6 after the 3rd goal. Villa did well to come back in 2nd half, Watkins took his goal well he normal misses them but maybe he is learning to compose himself in those situations. Grealish is playing well for City. De Bruyne if fit he has to start every match so important to the team.
There was contact on Grealish but the way he went down was shameless
Pep is naive sometimes, why didnt he play this team against spurs?
Seems the league is still fresh for the taking
Moment of Silence for UTD fans😂😂😂
ALL City players look the same
Why didn’t haaland take the penalty
Makes me laugh how biased the pundits are, if that was a foreign player that dived they would be all over it
That was never a penalty. I would have booked Grealish for simulation.
Arsenal will lose the next game against City and will crumble like a deck of cards. Wouldn't surprise me if they bottle the top 4.
grealish the diver at it again grealish would be good in the olympics for diving he would easily get a gold medal
100 million for a man with the single talent of doing a fish impression when another human being comes near him.
Really unfortunate hearing what is happening to citizens
As a City fan we have Arsenal on the ropes now let’s hit them with that knockout blow on Wednesday night and go top
I 100 percent believe that if city didn’t have mahrez they wouldn’t be what they are today
Cheats
Pen all day long.
That Durán shot would have been an absolute screamer if that had gone in!  Hit it so cleanly
Havent this lot been relegated yet?
City must thank VAR
Arsenal 5-0 Man City next Wednesday x
Cheats
I hope city win the league to save England from Arteta’s Haram Football.
Grealish is such a little rat
City have won everything through cheating. They deserve to rot
It's obvious that man city will win the league Arsenal fan.
Haaland decided to stop scoring so the others below him can catch up
Someone plssss get Martin Tyler off commentary
where are all the city fans in the last clip? half of them left
Within 3 points but they have a game in hand so dont know why they say that🤦🏽‍♂️😂
Lots of empty seats maybe some of the fan base staying away due to the cheating allegations 🤔
Another really exciting, enthusiastic and energetic commentary by Martin Tyler
Halland saw the Open goal and said too easy 😅
Was at the game today and I have to say, Duran could be a star. His athleticism stunned me and clearly has high quality instinct. Frightening for someone so young
I swear Grealish tripped himself up
Rodri🇪🇸🔝
3 point gap with Haaland looking set too end his goal draught v Arsenal
A bit of a soft pen looks like the powers that be want city to win the league lets see what gifts they get on Wednesday 🤔
Grealish diving against his boyhood club when he's already 2-0 up, bro is shameless 😂
Beating Villa is easy  Even Stevenage done it 😂
Grealish is absolutely shameless
Looking forward to Wednesday I don't support either of them.
If city beat arsenal city will go on to win the league
Grealish is an embarrassment for £100m
Man cheaty FC
If Grealish doesn't make the 2024 diving team then It's rigged.
Mahrezez shot just landed in me back garden
Grealish diving against his boyhood club is embarrassing
As an Arsenal fan from the start I’ve said that I’m only making judgements for the title in April cause I’ve seen this coming once Jesus got injured it was just a matter of when it was gonna happen
Mahrez again great signing
The irony of the City fans booing the Prem anthem 🤣first time you could actually hear them at the Etihad
Was at this game brilliant game
Unlucky Villa, Durham has a lot of potential moving forward. Amazed he didn't score
"He doesn't need much invitation Jack Grealish". No, call it out as diving/cheating and you might take a small step to change. Keep on with the "he went down easily" and you'll never sort this ingrained, accepted culture. Goes for all players, not just him.
As a villa fan I now know how it feels for grealish to be grealish and go down really easy sucks Still love the guy but it sucks
I love Pep's mind games. He declared Arsenal champions a few weeks ago saying MC can't reach them. But if they win on Wednesday, Citeh will be first.
Grealish the new Premier League diver
With this form they'll be the greatest Championship side of all time
Will 2019 to 2023 also be investigated.. They got caught cooking the books by shifting around large amounts of money, now they use multiple mock po box numbers to fund transfers. Relegate them as soon as the season is over. No sympathy for cheats
I think Haaland is being so tightly marked that it gives other players a chance but I think that it would be the same if he moved clubs
Haaland’s brilliance is exemplified by their second goal. He COULD have attempted to pass it into the goal but chose to hold up and cross it. Brilliant.   That said, I don’t like city.
Casemiro clear of Rodri
Martin Tyler WAKE UP!
Villa are miles behind the class of Cities multimillionares, who can compete against a squad costing 1 billion?? And all genuine, honest Guv.....
I hope Man City answer for the charges that have come out.
Arsenal were robbed by a Var official because he forgot to draw the offside line, it's an absolute disgrace, but I have faith that Arsenal can beat City especially if they play like they did against Spurs. COYG! ✊🔴⚪
Man cheaty and Roberto Mancheaty 😂😂
Bruh that was a dive for the pen like cmon man
Grealish is such a diver That was never a pen
Give all the penalties to Haaland so he can have a crazy record this season
arsenal ain’t winning the league
Means nothing as there cheats
UTFV SOTC
Love how there’s no Man City fans in the comments do they even exist
CHEATS
They're also 1 game ahead of arsenal so technically that's not completely true.
Just funny it's corruption 🤣🤣🤣
Reporter : Whats you're best attribute?   Grealish : Diving
1:34 "He doesn't need much of an invitation" - translation = it was a dive.
Grealish diving against his old club lol 🤣
Right into the empty rafters!
3 points not deserved have people forgotten about the Man City situation
Ah!! never mind! Villa❤ are doing well! 🙂
World Cup Final Keeper 🤣
Grealish should do well in an Olympic diving team 😂😂😂
The wind blows a little harder tonight  Grealish wonders who is pushing him
Cheats.
I think city should play Haaland Alvarez and Foden upfront with de Bruyne mahrez gundogan and Rodri in middle
Grealish dived again, he lifted his left leg and clipped himself on the back of his right leg!!
Arsenal have collapsed its absolutely wonderful 🤣😁
City should play more balls through to Haaland for him to chase. Even if it’s anywhere in behind the guy is an animal and can force defenders into mistakes.
City cheating again
Var moves man city to within three points of arsenal lol
Folks saying Arsenal deserve to win the league on the radio yesterday - it's February
I'm a City fan and I can't wait for the Arsenal game. I'm going with us 1-0 but I doubt Arsenal will win the have not found a victory past 3 games wich we have.
Grealish even dives against his old team
0:34 summary of how Haaland has been utilised at City
City starting to purr and Arsenal starting to bottle, this could be the turning point where they switch places
BY DEFAULT! Disgusting. 4 points stolen from Arsenal by VAR against Newcastle and Brentford! If Man City win the title by less than 4 points it will be null and void! SHOCKING!
Grealish is a cheat, should be ashamed of himself.
Arsenal is in trouble 😂
penalties are getting softer every time, defenders not alowed to touch or challenge attacker anymore.
Arsenal will still win the league anyway in my opinion, city will drop points again like we've all seen this season, remember it's not only arsenal that will drop points from now
After the first half, glad it wasn't more but that's playing away at the best gets you
Imagine diving against you're old club?
Lol hows that a pen 🤣🤣🤣ah typical grealish man, surprised that challenge didn’t take his leg off
I'm a liverpool fan...I guess arsenal fans didn't realise how hard it is to fight city for a league  .... 😏
why did gundo not pass to haaland if that was jack that wouldve been an easy assist and goal
that is one empty emptyhad
Points deduction on the way...🤔
Grealish diving against his old club!
Grealish is not a Villa fan at all!
Plenty of second half positives for villa fans. Dhuran looked lively and Coutinho also. No shame in this result. But City fans are reacting like they’ve won the league. Filling your stadium would be an achievement. Try that for starters.
Grealish, the quintessential diver.  Its about the only 'talent' he has
Grealish still diving I see.
grealish tripping over his own leg and getting a penalty, thats is why i now hate football its corrupt and very little sportsmanship anymore.
All the people saying “never a pen” can tell you don’t play football. The defender got the wrong side and clipped him. It’s poor defending.
Cheats
Isn’t hard to win when your playing a team who abide by the rules against a team who have purchased everything in their short history, if history has told us anything, all cheats eventually get found out
Aston “we are a top 4 club honestly” Villa strike again.  😂😂😂😂😂😂
Jack Divelish
Love the misleading title completely ignoring Arsenal have a game in hand.
If Grealish stood in a city he would get closed down a right dive
Funny if you play your best team you generally  win Something to think about Pep 🤔
relegate man city to the championship
Erling Haaland was supposed to take the penalty
Cheating off the field and now grealish diving and cheating on the pitch. The club has no shame.
as a man utd fan, draw next week. thanks
Grealish is great in the art of simulation. Sublime even. The best I’ve ever seen.
This is the time of the year arsenal go on bottle job.
If that Duran volley went in I would have screamed.
Shartsenal fans shaking in their boots right now
I hate Man City - hope Arsenal win the league they deserve it.
never a pen and to dive against your old team is disgusting
KDB in your line up = Ruthless Man City
Omg so bored of the same old results I had to turn off and watch gardeners world at half time
Can see why arsenal legged chambers he’s awful!!
And they question if its haaland that makes city worse lol. Stick that in ya pipe and smoke it
Congrats Man City Premier League champions 2022/23
City probs take league ,shame
Mahrez 👏👏👏
The atmosphere. Lets show the prem who we are. This is our city!
Back on track …. We can smell you arsenal. As Liam neeson once heard good luck….
Top mahrez
wild celebrations from the city fans
Arsenal need to be this ruthless if they want to run city to the end
arsenal bottling it lol   small club 😭
Tom Daley asking grelish for advice
Plastic is made from oil. The process is called “Manchester City”.
how poor was villa as a gunner i am sweating buckets
0:30 greedy from Gundogan ngl. Haaland was free
yay i love that the cheating mancs are closer to robbing another title. Absolutely love it
That MISS from Mahrez costed me £511!
I think City are gonna win the title. And i think they're gonna beat arsenal Wednesday.
Southampton will win the league.
Arsenal now bricking it
Arsenal have thrown away their points cushion 👀👀
Arsenal should be more worried about Utd!!!!
Lovely play by Haaland to assist Gundogan
That was the most boring 2nd half ive ever sat through
I know the shot was good sky but i dont think it counts as a goal
KDB is going to be a problem for Pep. He just lifts everyone up around him. Not many players in world football have the ability to have his kind of impact. He's the real MVP in this City squad
They do realise arsenal have a game in hand right?
Villa keeper clutching his head and the reply clearly shows not contact. Needs to stop, there’s to many at it!
Anything city do doesn't matter, it was all cheated and meaningless, the sooner they are dealt with the better
Now the football world Just has to sit and wait til Wednesday Nite for Arsenal to complete a bottle job that is 100 times better then last season Arteta has out done himself   Who says cooking your books doesnt pay 🤣🤣🤣  City 2023 Champions 🏆
Now the football world Just has to sit and wait til Wednesday Nite for Arsenal to complete a bottle job that is 100 times better then last season Arteta has out done himself   Who says cooking your books doesnt pay 🤣🤣🤣  City 2023 Champions 🏆
Grealish what a player 🔥🔥🔥
Haaland has been found out and can't score anymore. Kane exposed him aswell
I’m not a Man City fan but wish you lads good luck against Arsenal
Mahrez is class for Man City . What a player 🌟
The big game on Wednesday is gonna decide the title for sure
Marez shot at the end litteraly broke my window when watching the video.
Could arsenal bottle it?
Gundogan from virtually the same spot he scored the league winning goal from last year!
Arsenal to not win a trophy this season!
Man City is going down it doesn't matter if they won
Poor Aston Villa. They now have to face Arsenal next
Result aside, which I expected, Grealish diving against his “boyhood club” for +1 goal difference, whilst playing for a club currently under investigation for breaking financial rules, is a fairly strong example of why people are falling out of love with the modern game
Man City can still win the league as long as arsenal bottle it and they don’t get relegated
such a meh result ngl
Haaland where are you?
For the love of football please win the prem Arsenal.
City. Please get relegated 😅
Sky do realise that arsenal have 2 games in hand? 😂
Manchester United is red
Good Game Entertaining ❤
1st
Good response to last week lads, let's keep this up! Glad to see KDB getting back to his best too. CTID. 💙🏆⚽️
First
City could win the title but no because city is in a bad position now) :
Never a penalty
These titles are useless when they’ll just get points tomorrow
First
Arsenal still winning the league
W game
