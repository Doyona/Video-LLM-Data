7:37 pull master sabse jyada pull par hi chudte hai
Yashaswi jaiswal vs Jammie Anderson
Kl Rahul ❤❤❤❤❤
Anderson was overhyped bowler and bowled in mostly overcast conditions, so he had to land the ball on the stumps so the pitch did the rest.  He played in such conditions so he had longevity and more wickets with more matches. Had he played more matches in Asia, one would have understood the importance of fitness and lack of assistance. He was just lucky to get those credit along with Stuart broad. Both were ordinary bowlers outside England. How many ashes they won in Australia 😂😅 during that long tenure. Had he been the greatest, he would have knocked out Australia most of the time. His bowling used to work in such conditions and pink ball cricket. Otherwise an extremely ordinary bowler. Even England had forced him for the retirement otherwise they had planned to drop this legendary ordinary bowler. He was playing only for the most matches and wickets that's it.
Closer to the body defence, prods and nudges by KL.. what better showcase of Test match batting !
IF YOU ARE WATCHING THIS IN 2025 I AM DEAD BECAUSE   I AM CRYING,NOW ALL YOU ASKING WHY ARE YOU CRYING ONLY 2025 BOYS UNDERSTAND ME    AN IAM BECAUSE (RO-KO) IS RETIRED FROM TEST CRICKET 😢🥹🥺💔❤️‍🩹😭😞  I,AM LOOOKING RIGHT LIKE THIS 🥹😊
Where is PR GROUP
Anyone after roko retirement  2025
I always love England crowd❤❤❤
9:18 what a wicket for England crowd 🥶🥶
and the disease of kohli's kniking-outside-off still continue even in 2025
Yaha bhi outside off par😢
Rohit Sharma in test cricket is just pure classic ...
Jimmy Ando will not leave the world of cricket
5 years still virat getting out on that outside off stump line, 5 years with avg of 25-30 in test.
Kl bkl rahanr ko out kra
Hitman we call him
Test cricket is the Best Cricket.
It feels good to watch England's test, the crowd is good.
Anyone 2025 😅
Slow Batting
Root = .h..t .h.. t  = .h.. T.. A
Sharma ji ka londa kya khelta hai
That cover drives from kl rahul are such a beautiful ❤
Such brilliant test match batting from Rahul, he really showed his patience.   Gotta say that shot from Pant to get off the mark makes me miss him so much 😂 he's a different beast in this form
Hitman batting and Sangakkara describing him in commentary 🤝💙🔥 Best thing for me💯
Kohli br like _ Anderson are you sure ? CAN YOU TAKE WICKET RIGHT NOW 👍😀
I think KL rahul should be given more chances at Test maybe at middle order but yes he should be given a  chance.I think the problem is mindset of KL he is playing so consciously for no reason.He should be given freedom to play freely.Kl has a century at lords oval and overall good record in england much better than roadman ahmedabad merchant gill
This is original test match playing lots of bapls
Jimmy is the king of swing
I reckon this will be the greatest ever test match of this decade 🔥🔥😍
India Win The ITC🎉
Is it me or do these modern bats, sound awful....
Test match in england is always a treat to watch,♥️♥️♥️
Why Kohli is called Mr impossible
Chokhli at his vest as always
Me who has come here to see kohli batting 🥲
Joe root ❤
The perfect conditions to play tesT.
2:11 this shot can be played on loop infinite times
9:14. Someone doesn’t look happy. Who would. One of the best batters out for a golden. Nice Jimmy Anderson
11:57 why audience are shouting ?
7:21 chu tiya vada paw sharma. phir pull shot mar ke out hua. india ka 100 run ka partnership nhi hone ne diya 👎👎👎👎👎
What a game
7:57 nice view!!!!
The Rohit  and Kl form was the one of the most important factor to go up the series
Test Cricket is at it's best in England! They love Test Cricket more than they love T20. The crowd in England for Test Cricket is unmatched to every country. In short, In England Test Cricket is the most enjoyable.
that was the second time i saw rahane get run out
9:15 Kohli
test cricket in england of ind vs eng is all about virat kohli vs anderson
The Joy of Andreson after taking Virat's wicket 😄 Even a legend bowler is so happy after virat's wicket shows how big name is King Kohli 👑
9:12 when you get world class player
That celebration after Kohli's dismissal speaks itself that he is a great batsman.
Don't know why but i feel very sad after looking at King Kohli's current form 😔 He was an absolute beast in 2016-18 even though i am not his biggest fan
England eoin morgan
The happiness of England get after getting kohli shows how important his wicket was
Because of Kl rahul only Ajinkya Rahane was run out.
Anderson took kohli wicket on 1st ball, surely be in top 3 moment in this english summer.
I understand that highlights packages cannot be too long, but sometimes there are cuts in the middle of commentators making some good points (like Strauss around 5:42). It would be better if you let it go on for a few more seconds until they finish their pojnt, before moving on.
9:15. Legend vs legend.,class vs class., That's why we are here
The crowds sound when Anderson got the wicket of Kohli shows how important is Kohli's wicket 🔥🔥
Imagine anderson having 150 pace
Rohit Sharma 💖and KL Rahul 💖are the best batsman in whole world to play in England
A new cricket shot  Kohli cover drive
Well played kl rahul
I remember going to the bathroom when pujji got out hoping for a Virat show and when I came back he was out LOl
2:11
9:30 what a great ball. Inswinging action with a seam point towards the slip so that the ball dips in and hits the seam and straightens. Simply Brilliant!
👍👍👍👍👍👍
Nice opener
Test format is better than limited overs match
Who are commentators?
I think Eng depends on Anderson and Root

Rahane need to look into his running, he is getting too many runouts in recent time. And Kohli and his form continues...
Very disappointed virat out
An amazing thing is no one can compare the england fans with any other fans in all over the world ...It,s wonderful to see that the energy they are giving to the test cricket ....world No 1 fans means a lot...Keep it up guys ....
Not to take any credit away from Jimmy but that was just too careless and reckless from Virat.
Team india💪❤️❤️
Kohli Misses His Century By 💯 Runs😄😄....
When kohli’s wicket fall,England team reaction
Rahul Rocks
Everyone :- Normally a fast bowlers loses his rhythm by 35 Meanwhile Jimmy :- Hold my 🍺 He his really G.O.A.T
How wired this is to make bowling line up selection without spinner in test cricket.

The English Football Fans are the worst, but the English Cricket Fans are the best.
Virat Kohli's overconfidence gets him every time!
England is not a cup of tea for pujara for sure , he won't even score 50+ in dis series
Value of virat kohli’s wicket Crowd says it all 🔥
Why no one is wearing mask ???
Stefen fin + Steve harmison + pat Cummins  = robbinson
KL RAHUL ALL FORMAT PLAYER
Rohit Sharma mazak ha kya catch de diya asaan sa 👈

Everyone criticizing pujara for bad performance but no one talks about kohli getting out for a duck.
Comment section is full with indians
Kohli still having same weakness against Anderson..
Anserson's old bunny in the town. :P
anderson is a living legend
My favourate Kl Rahul
Please include DRS ball trackers in highlights packages
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH ...... I THINK WE SHOULD ERASE THE "KING" FROM BEFORE VIRAT KOHLI .......
Me after seeing Stuart broad still playing 😐
Kohli chutiya nhi tha isiliye australia ko australia mai hara paya team india or final pe agaya har gaya Newzealand se aab team mai hai har jayega india

Bhai Bhai at 9:15 the shout from crowds and English men know the importance of the wicket 😮😯
Best betting kl Rahul
I see nowdays Rohit get's start, then he himself thrown his wicket...being a Rohit fan it's painful to see that!
It was really sad for me 😔 Out on O run.....🐥 Next inning I will tried to do my best
*please do also watch Bhuj new song Desh mere by Arjit ❤️ just outstanding 😘*
Why are British cricket fans the most disciplined but football fans are the most  violent.. it’s 21st century .. still can’t use the excuse of football being working class game so the unruliness... football is an international sport now.. time to grow up already!!👀
What lousy quality of highlights!! Seriously whoever is in charge of this, you dont think it is a bare minimum to show the hotspot or ball tracking for reviews???? No coverage of dropped catches?? Just check out the highlights in Youtube for the recently concluded India-SL series. WAY better quality than what you guys are doing!!  A high schooler can do a better job of editing. Pathetic ECB!!
What happened to Pujara and Kohli? They are totally out of form for the last 2 years.
Woreset indian captain
Love you Rohit mess you dhoni ❤️❤️
Love you England
I have no idea what I’m hearing or seeing, like a dream I can’t make sense of
KL Rahul ❤
The crowd! ❤️
James Anderson and Roger Federer are never gonna get old surely.

Kohli ko vishram ki jarurat
Maa chod do India ki.  England rocks
Jimmy Jimmy... O Jimmy, want to see you for another next more years. The legend of my generation Jimmy. ❤️❤️
Pujara Rahane ke din gaye
सबक सिखाते हुए दोनों भारतीय शेर
Today jadeja batting.. Pls video
King of swing when take wicket seem 💥💥🔥🔥🔥
दो चार चौके छक्के पङने के बाद ये अंग्रेज लोग तिलमिलाने क्यों लगते हैं।
When Babar gets out on 20 runs: "He doesn't even know how to play."        "Why do people even compare him with kohli?" When Virat gets out on 0: "This was so heart breaking."           I think this is not right. The rule should be, one match can't decide if a player is good or bad.
Kl Rahul is legend in this match
Just in case u were finding Anderson's class: 8:34  Here u have it ❤️
KL & PANT 💐
Abe test match ko t20 bna dia , itna halla test match mai
India need one more Sehwag for top order
They said spin friendly tracks are cheating! Then what they do now, bowling under the clouds 🤣🤣, so he can only bowl of clouds are in place. He never did better in outside england 🤣
Kohli for a duck... that's Anderson for you ..
I really love the england crowd
England jitegi 🎉
Virat kohli ko captaincy se jitni jldi ho ske hta di jaye aur test me rahane ko bna do ,nhi to ye hamesha aise hi krta rahega
How many times we need to see virat failure
KL - KLASS ❤️ What a batsman . Look at his technique
🎉🎉🎉
Kl Rahul is something special I think he is now crossing Babar azam and kohli in all formats love from Pakistan 🇵🇰
James Anderson on a fire 💥💥
I was watching the highlights because I wanted to see how kholi got out and I couldn't believe he got out on the first ball.🙂
golden duck 🦆 for the king Kohli,😂😂👎👎👎 K L Rahul good batting 👍👍❤️❤️Jai Hind
Jai Shree Ram 🙏
Anderson is one of the best blower I have a ever seen❤️🔥👍🙏
Kohli misery continues against Jimmy 🔥🔥
What should i do, if i criticise kohli fans will have my neck, if i say it happens then i think its been happening for 2 years now😑
BCCI is the worst broadcaster. You have to install their dumb app.  ECB and Cricket Australia are great.
great highlights
Today,I am surprised that bumrah scored 28 runs against that bowling attack and at that england condition ,great!😱
Indian is the best 👍👍 ❤️❤️
KL Is The Legend
Indian crowd too alive the test cricket
Virat ki bs ki Kuch bhi nhi hai ye ja anasuka ki mare 😡😠🤬😡🤬🤬
*Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna Award now renamed as Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna Award.*
salman butt said jimmy was bowling 140ks well i have not seen it for a while.
England crowd ❤️
Anderson is a legend only in his Country...  Rest in country he is either injured /missing 🤣🤣
The beauty of test cricket
Where is ishant sharma
It's was a very disappointing moment for Virat and Indians fans after the golden duck by Anderson....... Next time Virat shall come back stronger 🔥🔥
❤️
Best batting by Bumrah
good cricket England... Go ahead.. Like from Bangladesh.
ECB deleted  hindi commentary  highlight  of ind vs eng.  1st. Test day 1
Ind vs sl Full highlights
Looks like kohli is anderson's bunny!
My cricketeting idol James Anderson 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍😘🇫🇴🇫🇴🇫🇴
Rohit suddenly realized that I m an odi player
Virat Kohli is finished 😭
Kohli come, kohli go 😅
The way they celebrate the wicket  of kohli tells what a legend he is😎😎
When you graduate from Lovely Professional University and appear for campus interview
Dalits and tribals are performing well in Olympics 👍🏻👍🏻😁😁💯💯   But caste terrorists attacking them .
TEST ❤️ INDIA VS AUSTRALIA VS ENGLAND
Nahi Aata to mat khel kohli
Sorry to say but Rohit & Risabh are not made for test series...they are aggressive one day & t20 suits them..although they've played some fine innings...but test cricket is not for them..only sehwag was perfect player to all three formats of game....!!!
Jusprit boomrah be now editing his comeback wala edit krke meme bana diya wala reel
Yeh BCCI ke pass itna paisa hai. Ek video nahi dal sakte ek YT channel pe. Kya dalle hai
What is wrong with kohli?
11:36,what a placement😱😱
vari good
*👉English crowd on cricket ground-Clapping,Cheering....*  *👉English crowd on football ground-Fighting,Slapping, Kicking,Breaking,Firing.....etc*
Kohli not Hit Century in Test Since 624 days 😲😲🤣🤣
Kl Rahul proves that he is number one class player nd it is show frm his shots 💓
Who is watching for India🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳,, ❤❤
Kl rahul is looking in a good form
Great crowd
Kalash Rahul 💓
6:47 was mind blowing 🙂🙂🙂
Anderson 😍
Why only Indian players getting out are shown replay in this series. Not showing replay of England team players getting out is sentimental?
Kohli should give up captaincy He is goin through very rough patch due to captaincy pressure..
एक बो टीम थीं न्यूजीलैंड के खिलाफ कम अनुभवहीन खिलाए थे और आज देख लो ।
soo adorablee...everyday love to wtch these guys plying the real test cricket
Virat again flop
pujara!! nice leave😂😂😂😂
Anderson utilising the conditions that suits him.  Indian's shouldn't have thrown their wickets away.  The top order apart from Rahul disappoints once again.  Once again the lower order payers have to fight it out.  isn't it time for a selection rethink?
India
Very impressive bowling from Robinson.
One time come when cricket overcome football
Pujara and rahane ke alava koi balle  Vaj nahi India ke pass
Kl Rahul prove his talent 😃😃 "KLASS" from Rahul.....
వెర్రి పూ..పుజారా
Kohli 😂😂😂😂
The Great King Kohli does 4 things in a test Match :  Goes For Toss Goes To Crease for Batting Immediately Comes Back To Pavillion Constantly speaks during fielding  He is that one person who does nothing in a group project at the press conference says since last 5 years this that...
Plz...Down the captaince kohli...u r chapter close
Great Performance by Anderson ❤❤❤.
Support Olympics ❤️❤️❤️❤️ play other sports🔥🔥🔥 it will rocks in future Olympics ❤️❤️❤️
7:01 that drive 😎😎
I'm surprise KL rahul missing at WTC
The crowd is so lively in England :) Love to see that in a Test Match
In 2nd day highlights i think every over bowled by Robinson...😅😅
Duck kholi, 😂😂
The bat sound 🔥🔥🔥
"ill just bat"   Virat kholi
Guy's I m telling u kohki is nothing she ',s big loser I hatttt
Come on England
"Anderson is just a wine"
2:12  OMG that shot from kl Rahul..... 😍😍😍.. Pure class...
Rohit sharma better batsman than virat kohli for sure
Anderson to kholi : Babar azam ka name suna hai , bharvey 😂😂😂😂😂😂
India need a Left hand middle oder batsman this line up
Ye  Apne ap k kya samjhta hi run to bna nhi pata hi Jake ranji khelo Bhai aur perform kro virat bhai
Acting of kohli remains constant 😂 dumb player
Indian Batting line ufff so so strong...❤️
India jitega🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
for a moment, I thought Robinson was Anderson. Robbie is having the same bowling action as that of Jimmy Anderson
Naku telisi pujara kastame ika
Pagal h Rahane bilafaltu ka out hua
What are you doing virat 😑😣
I really loved the way in which they made this highlights video 👌🏻👌🏻
Iam a pakistani or mujhay kholi ka maza aya out hua  I like kholi wicket
Why Don't you show the reviews?
Kl rahul is the best
When I see Anderson celebrating vk wicket, I understand the class of VIRAT KOHLI that how important his wicket is. And also I would give one advice to Anderson don't celebrate much you have taken virat wicket after 7 years 😂😂😂😂it might be a happy moment for you so congrats 🤣🤣
duck holy
This is master class of kl rahul
What do you did special in this innings England cricket
Kohli is gone 😡😡🤬
No doubt, kohli is a great player and obviously, he will come back in his style.
Anderson: Swing king Rahul: Pure Class Both: Legends
1:11 that straight drive is absolutely stunning 😍
Whoever makes these edits needs a pay cut..why would you cut off the reviews!!!
This is not the Kohli we used to see..😔
Virat Kohli 💖 Fans always Wt celebrating......Virat Kohli wicket..... that's the power of Virat 💗
That was a sad end to Rahane! KL Rahul batting beautifully and standing tall. Cmon Team India...play hard n fair
9:16 the loudest crowd.
Op kl Rahul ♥️
Rohit says bhenchod when he out 7:30
Lord shubman gill must be happy now😂
The england Crowd always alive the test cricket
I love test cricket
" DISLIKERS ARE FANS OF JASPRIT BUMRAH 😂😂😂🤣
Land kholi
Wow Rahul completely neiled the England bowlers.
Sam vs Rahul 2018- inside edge onto the stumps Sam vs Rahul 2021-beautiful cover drive (4:00)
After watching these highlights, I have only one word for James Anderson that is "Masterpiece".  One of the best swing bowler of modern era of test cricket. When he is in his prime form batsman looking helpless and worried .
Anderson is legend .. at age of 39 . what an incredible bowling his .. just awesome 👌👍
Viral Kholi has no integrity,how can you get so big of a knick and turn around like you didn't touch the ball...
India’s middle order pathetic as ever. Now Rahul and lower order has to save this innings.
Test lover
Sam curran isnt a good test bowler. Hes bowling T20 style.
Jimmy andorson all time swing master and beat all besmen claass
Good batting by K L RAHUL.....
Class of jimmy Anderson
It might take a long time for us to see vintage virat batting . Now it's only energetic captain
hardly a comeback!!!!
Virat has the Most ducks in by an Indian captain in Test Cricket😂😂
Jab se koli ne shadi perfomance zero hai...
Well Played England Cricket Team nd James Anderson❤🥰 ;
James Anderson out babar azam  James Anderson out kohli 🙄🙄
My frv James Anderson
A alive test nation
England loves test cricket
Anderson vs Virat Kohli next innings guy's who win
Celebration of Jimmy Anderson tells how big cricketer virat kohli is  !!!
Highly overrated Kohli by Indian media and Bollywood celebs and others.  He has no class nothing.  Kohli you are doing good on Instagram leave cricket.
9:14😂😂
Kohli is a failure overseas or outside India.  He should be removed from Captaincy in all format.
Heres some advice 4 koli . Dont lunge forward, play late when the ball swings . Basic child error.
Good watching on ball kl Rahul  😘
Duck kohli😂
Kohli has become the captain for getting out most no of times on zero he should take guard of off stump to know where exatly his off stump is he is our main batsman other than Pujara and Rohit
See the difference in celebration when Jimmy got pujara out and when he got king on a duck .....THATS KING FOR YOU HATERS.......
Aree bhai koi pant ko batoa ki ye test cricket hai.
Virat Chokli🤣🤣
Wow. What a beautiful delivery to get rid of pujara
A very nice test cricket is on the way at home of cricket....... Love to watch test matches there..... From Pakistan 🇵🇰
Crowd does a monty panneser
Just 6 boundaries in 25 overs !!!!!
Kohli😂
J Anderson best test bowler in English team
Flop show continue of King Virat Kohli
That's our kohli ... Legend indeed !
The kohli always did this mistake. That is, he plays ball outside off stump. When we defend this type of ball our eye should fully focus on ball. But, look at here he fully out of control to play that defencive shot. I think his ability is lost. His position in test cricket and T20 cricket is in a hanging bar. Agree or not?
kohli tattttti
Swing king Anderson 😍🔥
Captain Kohli missed his century for 100 runs.
I watched Kohli's dismisal 10 times.
Indian hit like
One thing I would like to point out regards to highlight is they made a good highlight package when not much play happened yet they managed to skip the part where Rahul was dropped off Anderson bowling after getting kohli out 😀. That surely deserves to be in the highlight package and also they could have shown rain stopping Anderson over 3 times before play being called off for a better narrative:)
King kohli will bounce back in next ininng  . A fan from Pakistan ❣️
why can't Rohit duck these short balls and why can't Pujara judge an outswinger ?!
Kohli fell only 100 runs short of a century.
How well Kohli batted.
Love the 100 runs that scored by Legend Virat Lulli 😂
😂😂😂😂😂is this your 👑🤷‍♂️ your boy got shitted on lol 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
James Anderson is great bowler , after getting one wicket more he will come at number 3 in highest wicket getter in test cricket.....what an achievement..... excellent
England is missing Archer and ben stockes
Virat jab tak captain hai, tab tak ek bhi icc trophy🏆 India jeet nehi payegi...  100% garenti...  Virat u r finish
All the cricket tournaments should be banned from england due to its worst weather.
James Anderson is the great bowler
Virat plz announced ur retirement...  We don't want to see you anymore, u r not sachin.
India 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳❤️❤️❤️❤️
Anderson bija 14gusti chotlok bija Larry Anderson to today beha
Rahane or pujara dono ko bahr kro team se.....  Like 👍👍if you agree
Virat Lolli Missed is Double Hundred by just 200 runs 😂😂😂
Ind vs Eng+rain...........as always
Anderson should go for Murali
Anderson getting Kohli  Reminds of Flintoff getting ponting in ashes 2005
Kohli's strength was aggression ,involvement in the game which is missing these days .this is the problem
Lets see how many fans of James Anderson and virat Kohli are here
Little Jimmy's reaction to lulli was like yeah I got my dad's wicket
The best audience in England's each match 👌they appreciate the other countries also ❤️ ❤️
Dale steyn fan like here not andersson
King 👑 kohli back soon 😭😭😀
I went deaf for a few seconds when England celebrated Kohli's wicket
India pkka jitegi
Slowly slowly England  forgot  to play test match
Bad country england always rain
Kohli's wicket and crowd buzz was just amazing
Rohit🔥
Rain Delay Day 3 4 5.
Very disappointed with  highlight.. i was fan of this channel videos, the way they make highlight videos Was outstanding but in this video they tried to extend video duration of half day match & shown many dot balls which was quite boring.. i know they extended video duration because they are getting huge views from indian people.
Started raining again.. England is not a good place to play cricket
Nice game
What ya batting by Rahul
Great to see Anderson getting kohli 1st ball
Drop kohli from the team he is becoming burden for India and useless captain.
The sound quality of stump microphone isawesome..
Don’t compare Babar azam with virat kholi Babar azam is far far better than virat kholi in every format 🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰💪💪
Rahane why are batting bro  keep bowling only Ok Easy wicket lol
I think India win this match
Kohli will be good babysitter
Kholi duck🦆🦆🦆.. What's happening??
Whatever it is India will win the series😎
Virat Kohli started WTC 23 with 0(1)
We loves Hitman❤️
Hitman❤️
dk means duck kohli
Accept Jesus Christ as lord and Savior because the second coming of Jesus Christ is near be ready

Anderson is the only reason to subscribe this channel! Jimmy you're beauty 😘
Legends always legends.. Anderson
Age doesn't matter and the best example is Jimmy's bowling...what a bowler ....
What kind of an editing is this?..all the important moments cut down to seconds..showing three replay of one shot..
Sala bharua Kholi
just amazed to see rahul knock &shot playing.classy❤❤👍👍
Anderson a LEGEND. ENGLISH crowd always ADMIRE GOOD CRICKET
Clouderson up to it again😛
Virat bhai ka bura form jaari hai.
Excellent bowling and fielding by England
What the hell is going on with Virat, i was waiting for his batting from so long and he's like came and gone. WTF! 😒
Great to JIMMY vs kohli
Miss u ben stokes ❤
India.....win
I lv... Kl Rahul ❤❤
Anderson phobia continues for Virat Kohli. What a spell that was🔥  Kohli's fear is like Hafeez's fear in front of Dale steyn.
बुलंद हो होंसला तो मुठी में हर 😶 मुकाम है, मुश्किले और मुसीबते तो ज़िंदगी में 🙄 आम है, सफलता पानी होतो हो तो ताकत रखो बाज़ुओ ✊ में लहरो के खिलाफ तैरने कि, क्योकि लहरो 🌊 के साथ बहना तो लाशो का काम है!!
Kohli should retire now.
King of  ducks😁😂
Anderson is a master of swing bowling.....love to see him bowl...only best of best batsman can survive against him
Virat always makes such face like he had never got out
Now virat  kohli  is totaly  fails.
I think Kholi didn't get his sprinkle water to get into form.....😀
Ollie Robinson bowling similar in Tim southee fashion😎
Dei sambu mavan kohli nd pujara
Nice speaking English bro
Hii
KL Rahul is great payer for all format  cricket..
Virat 💝 you must  have to play
The way anderson celebrated you know the value of that wicket
On first day indians were like bla blah....even they know they are playing with depleted england team..no stokes..no mark wood..no jofra...but still indian fans blah blah ..and on second day indians batsman get whacked badly by 2nd strength eng team ..o wow again noe indians are on their feet after losing 4 wickets against 2nd strength eng team😂😂
oh man KL Rahul is batting superly stylish. impressed me alot...
What are these highlights all they are showing in the fist 5 minutes are singles 😭 Please learn from the Aussies channel
Crowd
9:18 Celebration tellls everything about the player 😅
Anderson being a bowler at age of 39 and kohli being batsman 32,you can tell the difference
Kohli super waste👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
Kohli missed 71 st century by 100 runs ❤️❤️
Shocking kholi😭😭
Are Pujara ko hatoa Ravi sir
Kenyakohli missed his century by just 100 runs also the most ducks as a caption consistency at it's very best his avg in last 19 months in test cricket is 24 so keep it up.
KL Rahul should be a permanent opener for India in every format of the game imo
English crowd reaction on kohli's wicket says everything
Pujara have to take rest from international cricket to strong his basics  It been long years Pujara done anything significant.
All the hard work done by our openers reduced to nothing by irresponsible middle order.
When virat  dismiss  everyone know the  how  valuable  wicked it is... ha ha   common skip  cheerup...
we are Argentinean
Be calm and virat will back
Say what you want but Kohli has lost his hunger and motivation for the last two years.
Rahane is not confident.  His Bat comes late on ball. Thats why he keeps getting out behind wicket. Yesterday he showed that he is not settled in mind by getting himself out. In short his career is over . Last series may be for him.
Dhoni Next Indian Team Coach 🔥 Raina  Assistant Coach 🔥
Worst fellows pujara and rahane they are playing only tests in that also they r not perfoming what they can do why selectors selecting them worst fellows
Leo messi left barca
2014  then 2018 and now 2021 Anderson vs kohli... Love u anderson ... Respect from Pakistan ...
1:12 is the shot of the day
Virat need 2 take some break
Pichle ek mahina se virat kohli lawra practice kor raha tha  Anderson ka ek ball nehi khel saka
Vk needs to take on challenge at one down ,instead of waiting for ball to get old.
Ind need 70-80 run partnership
Virat has  forgot all techniques
Make it a little shorter the editing management just dragged the whole things....
Kl class
ECB, Please don't be like a ass hole channel, Edit the DRS reviews into the video as well, without them its no fun...,  you are a poor channel...
IF Anderson gets going than he can snatch this math from india
First jameison and now anderson VK hasnt learned anything from his mistakes.
Virat looking fat today. 😁
Kohli vs Anderson ❤️❤️
Excellent opening partnership ruined by no 3,4,5. All scrutiny on Pujara but even Kohli and Rahane have become too inconsistent. Give Rahane & Pujara 1-2 games to perform or perish. Give captaincy to Rohit, Kohli's prime period is over.
GOAT 🐐 VS GOAT 🐐
Hitman's Bat wasn't good enough😕 Sound of the bat poor🥴  Who agrees?
Bumrah  is lord
Expecting a good day 3 for India
Pant should think of becoming another DHONI  only for stats purpose,not in style of shots,,, it is well he is good abroad, hope this success will not go to his head, else he will be in benches!!!
Anderson will be punished by Kohli 💙
Please make the highlights small and quick
Kohli comeback is great
INS24 GAMING
Andy turned the match
Rahul last Tak marega
Itne achhe opening stand ki maa behan kar di pujara aur kohli ne....... Bakwas player dono
You have to feel for Pujara... that ball   by Jimmy was simply unplayable..😍 if Pujara had missed it, he would have been LBW.
Empiring is pathetic. So many decisions against India.
One thing is Clear  England crowd and test cricket made for each other
jimmy jimmy jimmy
Rohit threw his wicket after looking in good nick.
Kohli 😓💔
We are waiting for t20i series win against the Aussies. 🇧🇩🇧🇩
I loves Bangladesh 🇧🇩💖🇧🇩
Jimmy is aiming for 700 or 800 god knows.
India jitega test match
Pujara nahi raha nahi toh yeh log mar jate 😂😂 . Batting kar kar ke saans phula deta bowlers ka .
What Conversation Between Kl And Robinson?
King kohli 👑 will definitely comeback 💥💯
Forget everything , Pant stepping out to James Anderson on his fourth delivery of his innings. 😁🤣😂
Get 250 and leave it to the bowlers to toy with this English lineup...   SERIOUSLY WANT THIS TO HAPPEN
Pujara is outdated... 👎
Anderson is the new God of indian people 😂😂😂😂😂
White hairs on sam is not as  good as brown 😀
Finally Anderson roars ....... expected few more ...
1st round to anderson 👏
Kl Rahul is the best classy player after Virat kohli in indian team
Fun fact:- England's channel this video in trending because of Indian fans
KLassy Rahul
9:16 The crowd's reaction shows how big & important virat's wicket is.
King Kohli will come back..Tbh only Anderson deserves Kohli wicket..but I know Kohli will definitely score at least two centuries in this tour.
Has kohli lost that edge? It's been a while since he performed like the world beater he used to be...
I hate kohli ☹️
Anderson boss of swing bowling
Why is the drs cut???????
I hate virat
"Chokli is finished. It's time for King Babar era." ~Honest Kohli fan
Anderson You Beauty 😍
Kl rahul good batting
Greatest crowd of all time
what you expect from indian billionaire players ..they already made money ..win or lose doesnt matter ..stomach is already full..🙏🙏
This is Pujara and Rahane's farewell series... Mark my words ✌️
Kohli played excellent ining
Rahul has become a headache for English side same like Steve Smith
Jimmy still showing his Master Class by dismissing King kohli
INDIA WILL WIN  INDIA INDIA 🇮🇳 🇮🇳 🇮🇳
Finally captain gives a gold medal to us😂😅🤣
India⚡⚡
Jimmy Jimmy Jimmy!!!!!!! Age is just a number for him. Class Bowling from Him!!! KL Rahul is the best for all format. Can't argue about Kohli, but it happens sometimes.
Virat kholi be like i m joke to you ? Lion is sleeping yet 😩😳
Kohlis wicket 💔
sb anderson se gnd maraye jaare humare hit man ki batting koi ni dekhega jisne bhn chod di england vaalo ki 🤣🤣
I don't understand why this ecb Chanel don't give full video of drs reply 🙆🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
Robinson pitches the bowl in same areas which makes difficult for batsmen
India is Lucky that they played Rahul in this game.. otherwise they were gone
Good see to KL's defence. Very classy player
rinku
James Anderson Stuart Broad is all time my favourite in the world Virat Kohli is loser Anderson is good
Jimmy bowling, taking wickets are beauty of seeing test cricket
ecb put the thumbnail as if they have took the lead in advance...🙄
Amazing cricket
Rohit just cannot stop himself from playing that pull shot🙄
James Anderson you beauty parlour
The highlight quality on you tube from this channel is the best in terms of quality...!
Kholi would have been the 5th wicket for England thank God he didn't come to crease
When chiku bhai was out whole crowd yeaaaaa.
Bad thing : Virat-0
King will bounce back in 2nd inn.
Lohli ke bus ke kuch nhi hai, Instagram chalne ke alwa
Who saw BenStokes at 7:31😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I love watching Indians fight among themselves in replies and abuse the sh*t out of their legends (Dhoni, Kohli, Rohit) as if they know any better.
KL Rahul is the best batsman in the era
Cricket is a festival in India vs England 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳❣️❣️😁😄😄 India win
Because of England crowd,match looks fantastic to watch
What is rahane doing there
Pant 🔥 England bale kyu nahi khele?
Mistakes from India tommorow rohit as always throw his wicket after a good start. Pujara is playing with across bat instead of playing straight bat. As kohli is not in form so he play away from body and gets inside edge. Rahane tried to be more agressive but he need to play according to situation and be patienceful..... Hope today India get 100+lead
Woooo
I don't think that Kohli will be out for a duck very disappoint 😭😭
Everyone says that cricket players should retire by 36. Meanwhile James Anderson rocking the longest format of the game at 38.
High time for pujara and rahane to be dropped. There are talented players waiting in the wing. Once mayank returns, he should replace atleast either of these two. Also, groom Ishant Kishan now itself as a backup to Pant rather keeping useless Saha. Terrible footwork by our batters against the swinging ball. worst three wickets I have seen yesterday falling. Let Vihari and Mayank be given a chances as much as Rahane has got. I feel Shardul plays better than Rahane.
KLass!!!
It's called TEST for a reason
Anderson Anderson Anderson... Real Star
10.8
Wtf. What kind of editor is this? Plz cricket England we want the old editor back.....
Still have to wait for Kohl's 💯.
Pujara is totally out of form..... Even worst show in world championship against Newzealand.. Time to look for a replacement..
Congratulations!!!
Well still game is in india's game.... We need rahul 100... With more patiences..... And pant have to move runs often too break English mental strength....     Really bad  record for V.k  😭❤️
Kohli bhai hum to century soch rahe the🥺🥺
Kohli must work on his game.
10:11 style in which bairstow is running. 🤣🤣
Anderson  ur the swing monster  in test cricket  ..love india
ಕೆ ಎಲ್ ರಾಹುಲ್ wtc ಫೈನಲ್ ನಲ್ಲಿ ಅಡ್ಬೇಕಿತ್ತು
Love rahul ❤️❤️❤️
They should drop Rahane and Pujara especially since v have Sky and Shaw in form...
Kohli in the op chat👍😁
SEEING KL RAHUL BACK IN WHITE DRESS PROVIDES RELIEF.
Kl classic short
9:17 best moment 😂😂
11:41 the student who studies well  and exam is cancelled🤣🤣
India should not loose grip on the match they are ahead in the game rahul pant should bat more and more
ICC Should give the responsibility of making highlights of World Cup to EWCB
Test cricket is festival in england and their audience have proved👍 from🇬🇧 but🇮🇳
माइक खराब है इस विकेट कैमरा का नंगी तो ऐसी साउंड थोड़ा आती है
If Kohli to face wasim , waqar , rose , Walsh , mc grath and other best ? Selector refuses to select him in Indian squad .
Jimmy has virat's no.
It's the crowd like this that keeps test cricket alive!! The best!
Rahane mind in IPL, this is test match bro
6:47 😎Some pure class from KL RAHUL👌...He has Improved a lot more than 2018 he was getting out very soon on inswinger from S Currran but after nearly 3 years the same his striking the ball towards long on excellency at it's best 💪👌🤗
Ek single ke lie wicket gawa deta wo ki test that's bad 😞
India
England Crowd is just Lit😎😍🔥
9:15 KING KOHLI😂😂😂
India
Class of kl
I hope our captain comeback with a good score 😐
Pujara Got Out on best delivery of the Year. Kohli’s delivery was a regular out swinger.
Virat Kohli, Pujara and Rahane all 3 averaging in 20's since 2019.   So now Mr Kohli whom would you drop??? Yourself naaa  Pujara is ur next scape goat. The way he played yesterday looked completely rattled.  Teams who have insecurity within the group can never win big titles. This is the legacy you will leave as captain👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Swing=Anderson
there's a fine relationship growing up in between Kohli and ducks in cricket ..
Thank you ECB for putting these highlights alive and for free on such popular social site. I guess I will thank you for this whole series. Next time when you guys are in board meeting with BCCI, do thrash them for not allowing broadcasters to put highlights on youtube for free.
KL Rahul the absolute beauty of cricket 🏏😍👌
I hope Kohli is hurt, I hope this stings his ego real sharp, just get the feeling he is complacent offlate and doesn't have the same hunger for runs anymore...he is at his best when he has a point to prove, we will see his best again if his ego is hurt...
They should remove kohli from captainship so that he can focus on his game. He is playing like he is going to retire
Don't Underestimate A Lion 👑 just because of His Age.
Apna Rahul jama hua hai piche pe
Best of luck ❣️
Players will be appreciated by any means but here let's cheer up for the English crowd who gives the appreciation to all player..... They know the real means of test match hatts off.....
😅It took 31 minutes on day 2 for James Andersen to 2/3rd of an over 😱 1st ball 6:58 pm 2nd ball 7:15 pm 3rd ball 7:28 pm  4th ball 7:29 pm ....All time are in IST... 1️⃣I think this is the first time in 21st century to bowl 4 ball in 31mins in an over due to 2:4 Rain:Bad light-that bad light made play to be stopped on day 2...I think if bad light didn't stopped the play there would hv been surely the collapse of Indian team <183..Cheers let's see on Day 3 whether 💪India Neutralise the pressure on and take 25+ lead or Jimmy/Broad Exceed the 🤯Expectations of blue team and dominate ....join The Extravaganza of Test on Day 3 10:00 GMT (3:30 pm IST)👍
Last 3 years virat bating was very very very poor bating 😞😞😞😞
Kohli plz go back to County or even ranji cricket to regain ur form.
Kohli worse form 😓
India lol this is not a home haha England   Nildit very soon jimmy jimmy aja  aja aja kohli lol always love form Pakistan babar azam
5:13
Kl rahul🔥❤️
What was rahane thinking there,,, it's test not T20, we expect more calmness from jinx ,,
The moment when Kohli got out at 9:15 = 🔥
8:34 & 9:15 jimmy reaction after virat's wicket🔥🔥
One man army kl Rahul ❤️❤️❤️👀🔥🔥🔥
6:20😒😒
Where is Archer, surely he is the better bowler. England are racists
Maja aya gaya jab kohili 0 par out hoga aya
Middle order is there to build the innings not collapse the innings. Our team India test specialist are at best🤧🤧
9:17 just hear the reaction of the crowd !!!!!! Amazing 😎😎😎😎
When I began to watch cricket some two decades ago Anderson was there
Virat :- The Rivalry will cary on
Virat kohli is not hungry for 100  i think if not why he has not that kind of aggression after 2019
Ek toh Century aayegi.... pakka aayegi Virat Kohli ke bat se is tour main 😎😎😎😎
2:33 virat shadow 😘😘
Gillian Anderson would be very proud of you. James 👍
Why isn't Chris Woakes and MOEEN Ali playing...
🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰
“यहाँ सब कुछ बिकता है , दोस्तों रहना जरा संभाल के , बेचने वाले हवा भी बेच देते है , गुब्बारों में डाल के ,सच बिकता है , झूट बिकता है, बिकती है हर कहानी , तीनों लोक में फेला है , फिर भी बिकता है बोतल में पानी ,कभी फूलों की तरह मत जीना, जिस दिन खिलोगे , टूट कर बिखर्र जाओगे , जीना है तो पत्थर की तरह जियो; जिस दिन तराशे गए , चमकने लग जाओगे ।
Jimmy's celebration was the highlight. Well played Rahul and Virat did not left Well.
Hey girl, are you a delivery bowled by Jimmy Anderson cuz you are a beauty!!
FYI : Jimmy is 39 years old  Jimmy and Perera are the oldest current players 🙌🏻
👏👏👏👏👏
Shardul Thakur not 2 in 2 but 2-1 over..  How is out ?????
Kl need to score big
King kohli❤
Seen nd heard kane Williamson call out for a run or no run the moment he strikes the ball ... That's the understanding he builds with his non strikers when he is batting ... U think it's a good method to avoid rumours at the non striker end by their jum p start when a bowl is hit by the striker.. And firm commitment by the striker which his nine striker hears before he or his partner steps  out ..  I feel this practise lacks in the Indian team..nd look what it cost..a wisket of rahane who was looking in good touch ...
Anderson ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Virat koli out in 0
beautiful bat sound
Kahi ye series Vk ke liye 2014 ki jaise na ho jaye
The one who was trolled in 2018 made a half century in the 1st innings itself. What a comeback KL Rahul 👍
Stuart broad looking off colour completely. Hopefully will make a come back.
Remove Kohli as a captain of our Indian team
Thanks Ji
Hope India will not be losing opportunity like first test at Australia where they collapsed even after getting advantage,,this is bond to cricket but should not happen often where you lose opportunities ,, and from another regret i think this bowling unit india had with 4 fast bowlers nd shardul in ,,this could be chosen in wtc final ,, we stuck at emotions more than others when doing something at proffesional levels ,,such things need amendments
I am sure  Agar test india me hota to itni crowd nhi hoti
Test without England is valueless...
Indians should play authentic cricket instead of running like they have fits. Kohli brought that culture.
Kl Rahul - CLASS❤🔥
ECB Has worst video editors..  not showing the important parts always and showing the boundaries 2-3 times
My favorite was Kohli but when Anderson got his wicket so I was very sad just because he is my favorite but don't 2 innings is lefeted so I think Kohli can hit 50 100 also but I think 50 and nice to see Rahul scoring runs for India play well today and hit another century to fix you place in test
Waooo! what a match and England fans who support there......
Kohli 0(1) 👏
On the basis of current form England bowler is better than Indian batsman...
Come back King Kohli😭😭
Jimmy it was a peach of delivery.....from Virat fan...love to see from you
Jimmy to bumrah--- APNA TIME AA GYA 😂😂
i love england cricket team and beautiful city but the weather i dont like always bad light and rain
KL Rahul is just class. I'm surprised they keep dropping him off the team.
I see first time rohit out in pull shot (pull shot king )
kohli jimmyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
0:10 that's a gentle flick
K L RAHUL  ANDERSON  CLASSIC
As long as English crowd are there test cricket is alive.
Copy right
8:06 Just Pujara Can Do That I Mean Why 😂😂😂
Please support our Olympic 🇮🇳
Despite being an indian fan Anderson you beauty 🙏.. and England crowd is just awesome they keep the test cricket alive 🙏 .. respect
That kohli dismissal was unbelievable and magical ✨✨
This is the best highlights  We get to see every run
look at the crowd when Virat was cought behind. that was something.
India got good openers
Kohli's golden days is over
Kl Rahul you Beauty 🔥🔥🔥🔥
You know how important is Virat kohli when you shout like that after his dismissal. Dont worry Indians second innings on its way.
08:35 This what you came to watch😌
We are indians 🇮🇳
@9.15   Best moment  Virat kholi thank you for another 100 😂😂
England crowd was awesome ♥️  The sound of cheers , it's amazing
Today pant will be the man
9:16
Can KL hit a century
Kl Rahul will make 100 tomorrow 💙
VIRAT WILL MAKE A COMEBACK FOR SURE 🔥💥
Pant in Test cricket : I have to play like 5 t20s in one match 😂😂
Kohli v Anderson just fantastic
Indians are gonna win anyway. Let england celebrate for wickets only.  Rahul and rishab will score century today.  India will score 350 todat
What a golden duck 🤣 The ultimate choker
I already said yesterday anderson will fire and he does!
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Remember the name of rishabh pant for today🤑
300 easily for India ❤
For me highlights started from 9:14 and ended at 9:40 🥺💔 .. Oh Jimmy❤️👏  what a delivery to get King Kohli out on the first ball 😔😭
Anderson 🙏
The crowd reaction after kohli out and jimmy reaction tells the whole story how much Kohli wicket means for England
"Anil kapoor ki jawani aur Anderson ki fitness ka alag he raaz hai"😂
Kholi ko ghar bhejo .0 pe outb
9:15 🤐
This man doesn't belong to this world, I am amazed by the consistency of Anderson. What a player. KL Rahul is the most underrated batsman on the Indian side, he is stylish, has good posture, finds gaps, deserves much appreciation.
Currently world best bowllerr  Jimmy
Don't hate on Indian players, they're playing cuz they're better than U.
Worst highlights
Look at the celebration of Kholi's wicket🔥
Indian team will win any title or big match only after Virat Kohli gets out of the team
Who doesn't love "CRICKET"🏏
After Virat's wicket ,  English commentators - Eng. Back in the game :-)
I was watching live at the stadium.. Kohl's wicket was a heart break for indian crowd💔💔
Choker Looser King with GOLD-en 🦆.......
Virat Kohli has got so much opportunity because there is caption of Indian team  Otherwise, if there was someone else in his place, he would have been thrown out of the team. 😊
Test Cricket is Always Best 👍
In tough condition and tough pitch, KL RAHUL played a sublime knock. Waiting for 100 today.
Thanks pujara
Zim kohli _0 0 0 😂😂🤣🤣🤣last two year,s  0 hundred🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂
Choking in 3 Or 4 games can be considered But not scoring in Test since last two years for such a high profile cricketer like kohli is not good sign for India. And here people are still overating kohli in social media.
England Crowd ❤️
Kohli was just 100 runs far from his century😢😂😂
What a batting performance by india. They are only 9 run behind from my predictable score 👍🤘 Best of luck 🇮🇳
Anderson reaction shows that how big wicket was Virat's wicket
No one can get Rohit's wicket except himself 😂
Everyone was trolling rahul for his bad performance in 2018 england tour but he proved that form is temprory but class is permanent but the haters who were trolling him became his fans
Rain comes when pant is in good flow
9:14 the moments we waited 3 years
Only problem is weather...rest are pretty awesome.
Wtf Rahane was doing ???? A risky run on every ball ? This was inevitable
Jimmy Andreson greatest of all time ❤️❤️ still hungry of getting wickets
i cant belive this king kohli gone at duck
Superb kl Rahul class🔥🔥🔥
Kohli on duck hahahhaha
Thank you
KOHLI MUST GO TO LOVELY PROESSIONAL UNIVERSITY TO PLAY WELL  HAHAH
9:17 😲🤯😥😩🥺
Virat's duck hurts more than a break up....
This match Eng win
King Kohli missed his century in just 100 runs King of ducks 😂😂
One of the great test after a long time
Looking at Virat Kohli's form, hope he dint past his prime !
9:20 💔💔
The only words that come to my mind is "RESPECT" and "KLASS" for ANDERSON and RAHUL
9:14 goosebumps moment man🔥
I always hate England weather, not suitable for world cricket
What a player Kl Rahul is🔥🔥🔥
James Anderson epic 🔥🔥
That's the buzz around the stadium when you get the world's best batsman out for a duck! Can't understand that should I feel happy or sad about it
Lol kohli 😅
9:16 England knows the value of that wicket 🔥💪
Its fine virat next inning
Please Kholi leave the captain
9:15 really?
bharat mata ki jai😁❤️
Unnecessary runout 😥
I am waiting this match today
Highlights is very bad
I love test in england
The way india collapse after lunch still 58 behind England will surely win 😂🏏🏏
Kohli Kab century Marega Bhai. Ab to 2 saal ho gaye.
Kl Rahul top batsmen t20
Kohli in the past 3 years has been pretty dismal. He gets out for single digit scores in every important match. His captaincy record in SENA countries is pretty poor as well. If he cannof win this series, he should gracefully resign. India needs to win big matches, be it under Kohli or someone else. We dont need to prove him to be a great captaun
I love English crowd , they support who play very well doesn't matter he's from English team or another team player
Bas Yahi kahani hai Aaj kal ke Apne India ke Test matchon ki. Bowler Match Banate hain.Batsman match Bigadte hain.
09:15 holy shoot the roar of the crowd 😵
Kohli missed his century by just 100runs.
Great delivery from Anderson to dismiss kohli
9:18 That celebration shows that how much virat kohli is dangerous to its opponents
Anderson is getting better day by day. Our bowlers should learn from him
Fire aab fire karega
why are we forced to see pujara , rahane and kohli struggle in all matches ? And then Pant scores quickly
A Golden duck 🦆 And KL rahul,  Rahane 🥺
Virat Kohli bounce back 😎
Kohli on his way to get a Golden Pair in this test match. Lmao
Virat is same old same old with Anderson...
I'll just bat 😂
Love the gesture of English crowds. They watch cricket like it should be..not like some street tamasha..
Lagta hai kohli apne sath ravi shastri ki bhi chhutti karwayega🤣🤣🤣
Question to ECB ? WHY u delete/removed the HINDI commentry highlights?🤔🤔🤔
Time for retirment pujara and kholi
Anderson still taking away the opportunity for new bowlers to emerge... England will regret this when him and broad retire for sure.
Yeh match 1 hai naki 2
Some ipl captian fans trolling kohli for the duck by anderson but remember in 2018 kohli where jimmy anderson and whole england struggled for kohli's wicket,,, 1match cant decide a legendary player but still some ipl captian fans trolling our virat is unfair and u all know who is  the ipl captian and his fitness too😆😆
In
Virat go and cook for ur arrogant actress. And get more endorsements.  That is what matters to u now
Gaye wo din jab test me 500 700 run bante the. Ab sala 300 bhi chale jaye badi baat h.
Still Kholi is my Favt -- Love from Pakistan
කෝලි කුට්ටුවාට හොඳ වැඩේ🌝
What a delivery by Anderson to kohli
Where is the catch dropped by Sibley
just stop expecting ton from him  iykyk
Kohli ko vahi baitha kar test match dikhao ki advtmnt par dhyan dene ki bajaye cricket par dhyan de
am from PAKISTAN..but i got really disappointed when kohli out on zero 🥺💔
KL is so KLassy.
Classic innings by KL RAHUL 🔥🔥
Kohli missed century by 100 runs
Only kl Rahul  fans here
Kohli be like Jimmy Jimmy Jimmy, leja leja leja (wicket)
The reaction of the players and the crowd when they got kohli out was ⚡⚡⚡!! It shook the heck out of me😱 as I was asleep watching the match
is this possible to be runout in test cricket.....
Come Back strong Virat
Good
Classy rahul
Indian batsman earn.... Trice as much as bowlers.  They are also responsible for most loses. The world is unfair..
Jimy jimy..
Indian batsman...quick to be in Forbes list as well as into the pavilion
Kohli test kka bakwas player hai.. Root Smith n  kane bahut ache hai.. Sachin ka record nahi tod sakta kabhi
KL Rahul 🔥🔥
Indian bats man... let me show u how I pour water in the bowlers hard work..😂😂. Can our batsman really have clap and motivate ours bowlers again if they get dismissed cheaply..shame shamem
Jai Shree Ram💪🚩🙏
You guys are watching cricket??
Rohit Sharma has changed his techniques for better performances with the bat which is really inspired for us But kohli couldn't learn from his mistakes  He Consistantly dissapoining us
In 2016 every  bowler infront of  Virat is just like a joke but now he is joke in front of everyone
Just one request to your channel, kindly do show ball tracking for an lbw decision
After earlier four wicket , pant came and says like i don't care, I'll play lofted shorts🤗
Rahul didn't even take one extra step for the run and was his normal forward motion after hitting a ball. Thane WA half way down looks like cold got into rahanes head. Dude do some warmups before u walk in.
Duck king is back😂😂😂🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
Once upon a time Virat Kohli is my inspiration but now he falled on all formats he is a good captain in test cricket but he forgot how to bat . In
Virat bhai ko nazar lag gayi hai
This video editor was not in mood while editing this video 🤐🤫😑
Somehow feel shikhar dhawan should come in place of Rahane at 5. He has matured  as a batsmen now and plays the anchoring role well in limited overs. He struggles with swing so 5th spot could be perfect for him.
Noob rahane n pujara should be sitted
Kohli should retire now
Anderson and English conditions = masterclass
Rohit wicket was a turning point other wise expected his ton , KL Rahul looks so pleasing to the eyes , he is playing so crispy at the moment. For me stylish player of indian team
Noob pujara
Kohli should be sacked
We British smashing these Asian teams apart Pak , Sri Lanka now India haha bye kholi golden duck 👌🏻🤣🤣🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Kohli need Rest bichara Thak gya He Add Kar kar ke
It's my request to the channel owner please include wicket highlights too for example review highlights
Rahul is pure class ♥️ from 🇵🇰
I also like kholi but only posting pics with Anushka are not enough. He needs to back in his old form. We want our old kholi who was always hunger for runs.
Rahane was only the player who could build innings ..but unfortunTely got run out.
Love you my friend
kohli over confedent ????
1:15 I saw it 5 times 😍
James Anderson next mission : 700 Test match wickets
If kholi and pujara will not show some improvement of making runs then I think both need to take a rest in some test series so that they should prepare and come. Legend's like kholi and pujara are not making runs more than more than average of at least 60-70 so what is the use especially pujara and. This is not the story of only one series they are getting flop on many test series. Now many are frustated. Kholi needs to come in form and pujara also they want to see where they are wrong
Only disappointed with d run out it hurts really bad
1:25 Shot was just a masterclass 🖕
Kl rahul
Gandu plyer kohlo
Time to give pujara and rahane a breakm
Set hoke out kon hoga Rohit be like:- me me meko sb aata hai
Pujara wast
Rahane is a clear baggage on the Team
Ruhul is Rok
Looks like Chokli is back. He should sit out for a few matches if his ego allows him to.
9:15 That huge pop🔥 Kohli's wicket value
My God! Hear that roar when Anderson gets VK!
Great Opening stand By Rohit and Rahul but middle order collapsed very badly 😒😒
Jimmy Jimmy Jimmy Jimmy aaja aaja aaja aaja Batsman jaja jaja jaja 🔥🔥
9:18  I have never seen Jimmy Anderson soo happy on field. 💯 It makes me happy❤ Keep going legend! 🙌🏽❤
Very good very good
Middle order ne opening partnership ki ma xhod di
9:16 this hurts more than breakup 💔💔🤧
Everyone talking about Jimmy and virat..but kl Rahul showed again why he is all format player..nd well deserved player in indian team...
The series is sure to be 5-0 ... Massive win for 🇮🇳
I can assure you that the two indian 🇮🇳 openers are going to smash England so badly that they will never come back again😂 😂
Kohli ko out kare ne ki khusi dekh rahe ho jase puri match jit li ho 😂
Kholi usually plays well when ball is not doing much for bowlers 😃
Only here to Virats out🤣 The egoist didn't even want to leave the field
KL RAHUL SHOT AT 6:46 IS GREAT ONE.
कोहली ne bhout निराश kiya very sad .ab nhi bnte कोहली se run .
How much of threat kholi is to england u can see that in their celebration of his wicket!
If Zaheer were born in England, he would've still playing like Anderson.
After falling wicket of kohli, England team and crowd know the value of kohli wicket very expensive 😄
🖕👍
Whenever I see Anderson my mind's automatically remembers Cristiano Ronaldo.
KOHLI SHOULD RETIRED IN TEST. LAST COUPLE OF YERAS HIS  BEST SCORE COUPLE OF FIFTIES.
9:14 Kohli vs Anderson
What will be score of Virat Kohli in second inning ? a) 0.           b) 1-50 c) 50-99    d) 100+ Comment 👉
Rishabh pant is a perfect example of "flamboyance". Stepping out to Jimmy Anderson for his 1st scoring shot!  😎
When was Kohli's century seen? 🥺😔😔
Broccoli is out in golden duck.
Absolute class shots by KL
People defending Kohli here if he is their sister's husband. Oh bhai, Kohli is now a thing of the past. Move on you morons. Kia jahil janta hai.
🔥
Thor : I am God of thunder.. Sachin: I am God of cricket . Jimmy:  I am God of fitness!!!
India India......
Why do you cut the reviews in highlights?
Hindi highlights has been shutdown now n comments are off for our country 😂😂😂 what a knock by ecb
Interesting match highlights with great details.  Kudos to the editing team.
ENG missing Stokes a lot. Stokes, what a Gem; 3 in 1.
See the day 3 in who's favour
Virat is worst batsman in whole world
Kohli, Pujara, Rahane - need to score this series or else there will be a lot of questions, just because runs have dried out in past couple of years from this trio in the middle order. Somehow Indian team managed to win a few games because of excellent performances by some other players down the order
What a delivery to virat kohli!!!
Give chance to other batsmen at number 3, pujara just floping a lot. Let him his form get back like KL Rahul and then bring him back. Meanwhile give number 3 to someone like Kohli or shubman gill when he’s fit
England will be come back
India , England , Australia - Always a great contest   when they Play against Each Other. Top 3 Cricketing nations by far!👌
Kl rahul big fan
Virat Kohli and Ravi Shastri will have to answer big time if Jadeja doesn't do justice to his place instead of Ashwin.
The first 6 mins of highlights were so frustrating for me 😔
I don't understand why people are going after Anderson's age;i do appreciate his fitness and accuracy but 39 for men is average age.
Jimmy Anderson 😍😎
Dumb way to to edit highlights. You should include review video...
Always classic KL R A H U L 🔥
Entire nation is celebrating for a single wicket.. That is King Virat Kohli for you..
RIP for those who think Kohli is better than Sachin in test cricket
How does it feels playing without a West Indian seamer  and New Zealander all around?
They had to show taking singles as highlights bcoz thats how slow india played
Pull shot ka choda pull shot main out ho gya 🤣
9:17 💔
This remember Rahul and pant Century in 2018 against england in 5th Test.We hope that they will do it again and India take lead of 200+.
KL Rahul and Rohit Sharma great partnership
England are best bowling in test cricket and croud always🔥🔥
Csk da
England's cricket board channel's target is 7 millions subscriber at the end of series 😂😂🤣
When kohli got out the stadium cheered  loudly
Just Listen the crowd when Virat got out by Jimmy , what a crowd
Why does not BCCI upload such class of highlights 🙄🙄 😣
Every time our bowlers prove their strength.i thing pant to play no 3 and rahane 4.
Only Man He Understand Salute KL RAHUL
Goli Out For 0🤭🤭😂😂
Jimmy under sun was not that effective but under clouds, he was just doing some incredible things.
Kl Rahul is best
Virat Kohli Downfall starts  If Anyone Agree  Plzz Like Here   😭😭
India will win this series
Great betting
India win ❤️🏆🇮🇳
Déjà vu😂..1st inn->Eng out-180-190.  India-150 or 200(may b).2nd inn->Eng ~200. India 140 all out.Only drop catches by England can save India😀.To win Ind need to score around 300 in 1st inn.Otherwise Doomed.Jai Hind🇮🇳
Next Video upload fast bro
Everyone please comment today India will get all out on what score? I think India will score 270-280
Why so long highlights ??
Klass
If kohli wasn't captain of indian team he would be dropped out of playing 11 several months ago.
May Allah destroy India and enemies of Islam
It's sad for eng crowd to watch asshole like rahul & rohit
I see nowdays Rohit get's start, then he himself throw his wicket... being a Rohit fan it's painful too see that!
ECB….it’s time for mid-year review for the person who edits your highlights videos. Customer feedback: ‘needs massive improvement’

King Anderson ❤️👑
ENG win 1st test
Where is hindi video?
Nice bowling
What happened to king Kohli
9:15 - england crowd celebrating kohli's wicket seems like they have win the world cup.
தமிழ்
And only one more wicket to go for becoming the third highest wicket taker in the history of test cricket going past anil kumble I am sure on day 3 u will get that
Kl rahul well played,57 runs 😍😍
Anderson proved that age is just a number.......
Very happy to see Anderson getting kohli out that made my day yesterday that was paisa vasool well done Jimmy hopefully I hope u atleast get kohli out more four times in the series
You deleted the hindi highlight why
Rohit gave tribute to indian team 36  And kohli gave tribute to afridi
Kl Rahul is legend look at his footwork wow adorable rahul
Anderson you beauty. Respect from  🇮 🇳  🇩 🇮 🇦
"""""If you remain humble, people will give you love and respect even after you have finished the game.""""” ..
Sam Curran very good boller and silent killer
James Anderson the living legend
Virat kohli ko gold mila.😭
virat bhai lgta ha fame me kho chuka ha...  no prep 😔👎
Ban cricket matches in England and save test cricket ....
“"""The difference between ordinary and extraordinary is that little extra"".
Why naser hussain is not commenting?
Rahane@ ...what were you doing ?  this is your 100% fault.....it is not ODI or T20.  You have to see 1st..yourself...then your partner Call..that..to in..1st innings...
Why kohli is in the team, he has not scored since 3 years now
All the hard word goes in vain rohit sharma...!!!
Remove Kohli from Captaincy
The way 😂😂 England celebrating vk wicket it show  how imp he is damn
Kohli lately is being a dead weight in cricket team. He dont deserve to be captian.. and his place in team too should be reviewed after 1, 2 series (rahane too) now its almost certain in all matches that pujara, kohli, rahane wont score runs
Women's test was more good in comparison to that of this test
0:08 super shot
Give away wickets from Kohli and Rahane
Good bollen England player
Kl rahul
Just look at English players after Kohli's wicket how happy they were so kohli Wicket is more important than others, 👑 Kohli
Why whenever pujara gets out, the ballers dilevery looks unplayable 🤔
Jimmy Jimmy Jimmy !!!!! 🙌
Remaining 4 matches Rain will be the man of the match, bowler who will take virat kohli wicket 😂😂
Why do they not show the DRS video🤔🧐🤨
Good pitch for test cricket.
Well-done england beat them like 🐶🚽🇮🇳🚽🇮🇳🚽🚽
James anderson debut When i was 45 days old Now I am 20 old
Chokli choked
Really appreciate of crowde in England for the test match in this situation
Kohli ki holo?😪
Klass, just kl Rahul things 🤗
Rahane bhai aisa q kiya 😭😭😭😭😭
James Anderson at his best ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
WIN  INDIA  WIN  ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤💪💪💪💪💪💪
Anil Kapoor and Jimmy Anderson's youth are still a mystery like Bermuda Triangle.
Pujara and rahane are done.
When u see kl Rahul only word comes in ur mind is pure class ❤️
English spectators r so good
Just in 15 minutes after  d lunch ind lost 4 wckts....😂😂😂 Stupid  prfrmnce by indian batsmen🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣👎👎👎👎
Virat is not great...an ordinary batsman
Virat a genius of his own is completely out of form and needs to be dropped from the team. Need to bring in someone in form especially in such a critical number in the batting order.
England crowd always alive the test cricket and the indian crowd always alive the all the formats of cricket 😂😁😁😁😁😁
Kohli's form is declining..
Rohit wicket changed the match 😭😭🥺🥺
It’s coming home
Jimmy is king of swing bowling...period ❤️
The best test match loving crowd❤️❤️
Amazing cricket ever
Poojara is in trance
Anderson vs Virat Kohli ! Oh man this is Cricket for you!
England is the best place to enjoy cricket because of spectators ...
Pujara is failing continuously, even after a good start this middle order has disappointed lot
Kohli for se shatak se chuk gya sirf 100 run se chuka h
Jimmy Anderson and Stuart never getting old
Kon kon is match ko hindi me dekhne gaye the lkin country mein unavailable hone ke karan yaha aa gya 😂😂
BCCI should give break to Pujara and Rahane..they got enough of chances
Rohit sharma pattern in last few innings same working hard for 30 odd and then throw away wicket. Bowlers had ensured that we are in game but batsman had disappointed. High tym for pujara, rahane,vk etc
good start from India and fantastic come back from England.  what about Jimmy Anderson, Just Fantastic.
Kl ragul what aa come back 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
KLR is the class batsman
why playing England country there's claimant is not good every time fan's upsetting useless tournament
Kohli should be retire in IPL if he will see long career in Test cricket
Kohli just trying to Show a statement that he is king kohli he has upper hand on Anderson now bt Anderson is legend u need to give respect him
49
Hahah kohli duck   Rahane running blindly   Pant start hitting
Any one notice..vadapab looks batter than loli😱😀
Kohli out straighter , acts like ball was so good 😂🤣,,,,,, bhai game pr dhyan de ajkl acting pr focus jyda h pichhle 2 saal se tumhara
Hindi highlights has been deleted 😂
Day 3 , I just hope KL and Pant first get to 183 without losing any more wicket, and then we can accelerate a bit  We need to get to minimum 250 to stay any chance in this Test🙌
Kohli 😂
In red ball how can one be runout what is the need to take risky singles.
Aapne ek video daala vo hamaare yaaa nhi Raha he in India not are come the new video
Winner of this series?? 1-loli 2-clouderson🤔🤔
Jimmy is breathing 🔥
The Following are my observation about First Test, Day Two:   1) I thought India did well in the morning session. They hold the line; they neutralized England's attack and were about to take a strong position, but Rohit played that shot. Why Rohit Why?  2) Yes, I know this is his style, but he defies many test match logics. He played an aggressive shot right before lunch and played a shot in the air where the fielder was placed; I thought he played a Pakistani batsman shot.   3) Pujara & Rehane Looked Shell Shocked. They were behaving as it was their first test match. Pujara was leaving straight balls. However, I thought Pujara got too good of a ball. Usually, too good of a ball does not get a wicket, but Butler took a superb catch.  However, still, Pujara was looking walking wicket to me.   4) Having survived a close run out, what Rahane was thinking? He was taking a risky single in that kind of match situation. The ball was hit right in front of him. He could have also called no for it. Even if they run for that single, then Rahul was a goner.   5) Kohli got the straight-up good ball right in his weakness area. Kohli's batting form is a worrisome sign.   6) India got unlucky; they survive 46 overs, the ball was old, bowlers were tired a bit, they had a chance to score some easy runs, but rain ruins their day. Now on day three morning, Anderson will come fresh, hungry, full of confidence, and with his tail up.   7) Here are a few hunches of mine for discussion points of view.   -I felt Rahul looked satisfied with his runs. I think he will not make many runs on day 3. if he did, he would solidify his place in playing eleven.   -I will not trust Jadeja (I know he scored two fifties in the side match) or tailender for many runs.   -In my opinion, the game will revolve around Pant. The more he scores, the better position India will be in.   8) India has to get 275 to make England uncomfortable. I'm not expecting a big inning from England in the third innings, but chasing any score on the fourth inning on Trent Bridge stadium is not going to be easy. Even 150 could get tricky.
Why you are ignoring DRS replay in highlights? and showing singles and unwanted replays multiple time?
Kl Rahul one man army ⟬⟭💜
11:41 broad's face🤣🤣 remember the six sixes 🤣
Clouderson 😠😡
I love england crowd
Chokli's time is over
Ajinkya Rahane just find himself to get out in wtc he throws his wicket in aus series he run out kohli and now he is get out himself
Would mayank get chance in 2nd test after rahuls inning?
Anderson line and length still so accurate 👍🏻🔥
The GOAT Anderson proving yet again age is just a number🔥🔥🔥🔥
KICK OUT PUJARA AND KOHLI NOW THEIR PERFORMANCE IS ABSOLUTE ZERO THEY ARE A BURDEN ON THE TEAM
The Indian team is just master of self sabotage.
My all time favrt kl rahul  Love you nd respect u kl
Come on Jimmy
Cloud come..so clouderson is coming in game... alert for Indian remaining batsman 😱😱🙂
England is playing test matches with 6 never performed batsman and they have given them enough time but still they are not giving the results and still they are always in Playing 11 of England.
India : Target is so simple Jimme Anderson : I'm still here 😂
Why Rohit? Why?
The legend is England cricket was this was Jimmy Anderson well but india win this series.
Interviewer : How are you gonna tackle jimmy Anderson? Chokli : I'll just bat Jimmy Anderson: Yeah for one ball 😏😏😏🤭.
Today Virat Kohli missed his century by 100 runs 😂😂😂 and Pujara missed his century by 96 runs🤣🤣😂😂😂
Why you didn't show kl 's fifty celebrations
Virat Kholi will be back. Englandies were dancing because they knew how a big wicket they had taken . They knew that thia one player can change all the game
England crowd
What is playing kohli on 2019 first doesn't hit one a hundred
Lazy Rahane
Scoreboard is disappeared
Virat kohli... Not agn please... Another ruined England tour... 😂😂😂
You didn't see jimmy when he was at his peak. Robinson got the talent to cover Anderson's  vacant spot.
This is what happens if you practice for jimmy anderson with arjun tendulkar 9:15 😂😂😂😂
The best thing about series with England🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿, Sri lanka🇱🇰 and Australia🇦🇺 is that these all cricket boards have thier own official channel and they always upload highlights ❤
That happiness after dismissal of run machine kohli.
Under Virat's captaincy, Indian team has become world's best but on the other side, his batting performance has gone underway!!
Someone should tell rahane it's not an ODI or T20
if KL Rahul had played WTC Final , then India could have won
Kohli mai ab bo dam nhi bachi 🙏🙏
Unplayable dilevery by Anderson to Kohli 🔥🙌🏻
Virat kohli  King of Duck
Plzzz don't remove review from video
England have their Saviour 💭💦
Why rohit always throws his wicket away, but he gave us a good start❤
KL Rahul Justin Langer of India
KL Rahul fans only
Despite getting virat on 1st ball India still is in good situation with kl at crease
No one :    Literally No one:     Rain:😎
Ye hote h test match sala mja h alg h dekhne ka.
Tomorrow waiting for pant s batting 🔥
No replay for England fall of wicket...but it's  for India's fall of wicket....THIS IS  NOT GOOD👎
I swear to god, rain, don't you dare spoil this series
Kl rahul Playing good test
Waste kohli👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎stupid
Anderson is really a fantastic bowler
KohLi on duck 😂😂😂
I am not seeing the virat what I used to see 2-3 years back. This virat has no hunger for runs that he used to have no aggression in batting
Why the DRS point cut
Huge difference between England cricket fans and England football fans 🤨
I am very desparate to see kohli 100
Rohit and rahul are the best opener in all format but unfortunately rohit got out by his own mistake , he was looking in great touch.
SIR JAMES ANDERSON!! grew up watching this man... what an absolute legend Look at the ball it was a inswing but hold the surface and gone straight with seam 👀😉 only jimmy can do this 🐐
We want it in hindi
King of Swing James Anderson is again interrupted by Rain
Kohli pujara outside off stump nemesis continues
The celebration itself shows that how dangerous kohli is So be calm haters.. 😜 😜 😜 King is king 👑
I think India will win the test
Duckholii 😂😂
K l Rahul is   ......world top batsman of All condition's
One of the most curious unsolved mysteries: "How the hell can a Fast Bowler bowl after 150 matches???"
Sam curren out swinging also awasom.
The  battle between Kohli and Anderson is reignited
Virat kohli fails again . Out on duck.
mai kohli se yhi kahunga ki..France ka pani pine se run nhi Banta...but I am not kohli hater...😥
Alternative title : Virat missed the hundred away 100.
Rahul back after 2 years happy to see him dominate in test also t20king odi comeback now test ... ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
The jimmy anderson swinging is also awasom and brilliant.
Jai bhim
Virat khud out howa clear Nazar ay rha ha
kohli failing again and again whenever facing quality bowling attack...
I think pant and Rahul will build a big partnership
Are bhai virat kholi ko bahar beju or bhi team me talented log hai
Some people like kohli focuses more on fucking fitness but they forget about their own game
Look at Hrishabh pant....how he smashed...😂😂
9:17 the  crowd
Rohit should give coaching on how to throw away good starts in tests.
That crowd reaction when Kohli edged the ball showed how important his wicket was to England. Those are the moments that make test cricket what it is.
India need The Virat Kohli
Anderson while take the wicket of pujara belike :😀😀 But after take kohli;😈😈
Right now....m'i angry on Virat Kohli 😡.....why why why why why .....😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭  Hey !!!! King plz wake up 😭
Only kl rahul and rohit sharma hi khel ne aye hai kya.. Dusre to sirf aarahe hai lr jaa rahe hai
The great Jimmy Anderson!
That's our jimmy Anderson love you Anderson
I think kohli again practice with the soft balls..
96-0 to 112-4 Excellent Comeback by England Bowlers 🇵🇰❤️
Kohli ducked. Appreciate Anderson for plugging his weakness. Hope kolhi finds his way to realise that his technique is breached without any tough mode of batting. That was like tailor-made ball 😳 and kohli fell like a broken silencer for India.
Virat falling 100 short of his century. Well played. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
9:15 When the stadium gets stunned?
Anderson is all time great bowler🔥
අපරාදෙ කෝලි මහත්තයට සෙන්චරියට තව ලකුණු 100යි මදිවුනේ😪😅
Play of the day Anderson got Virat for the 6 time in test and overall 9 in international cricket 2'nd most succesful against Virat Kohli in international cricket only Tim southee ahead of James Anderson in  international cricket dismissing Virat 10 times 3 dismissal in test and 10 overall
KL Rahul as a opner Class player no dout he Proves it👍🏻🙂
Who says Kohli is better than Babar. Anyone who says that can suck my D. 😂😂🤣🤣🤣😂😂🤣🤣😂😂😂😂🤣🤣😂😂😂
No batting no catching but sibly will play the next match😑
Time to give Kohli and pujara fpr  a temporary rest
india he jeetega .abi panth khelega  dekhna mazaa ayegaa match
Only 30 overs ? What happened ?
sony tv sucks..  lucky enough to see highlights
Kl Rahul ❤️❤️❤️
Fight back hard King Kohli 😘
Show the review also 8:10
Chalo India mein kisi ko toh gold Mila 😂😂😂
bhai kohli ab buddha ho gya
What a great form KL RAHUL in 🔥🔥
We want 2016 ,17 ,18 virat kohli the runmachine 😢❤️
Whenever I see Sruart Broad I remember 6 sixes by Yuvraj in 2007. Its been 14 yrs but still I don't know why.
Wow, Rahul brilliant!
9:30 England back in the game
Good Ind
Look how English celebrated vk wicket that's success means to him ❤️❤️
India 🇮🇳 is the most powerful nation and cricket Team
Virat should play at no3 i hate him playing at no4 or below he need some time . Let's hope for the best

Kohli is in serious trouble with his form. He hasnt scored a single hundred in last 47 international innings in almost 2 years. What is more worrying, he is continuously getting out even after scoring 30/40/50 wheras in his prime time he would convert those 30/40/50 into bigger hundreds. The reason could be," he is getting old and those reflexes, focusing power may be declining.
Pant is attacking not spiner even pacers
Dear ECB, Remember that KL Rahul has been unbeaten with a score of 57... Dont be partial in putting tge headlines and the match highlights...
Ajinkya Rahane  so sad  run out 💔💔💔
I dunno why but I still believe that we haven't seen the *PEAK* Virat Kohli form yet. Yes, what he did yesterday was dissapointing but let him stay in the pitch for sometime and you'll see the magic
Kohli first ball out  Whole crowd ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh Indians oh bhai mujhe maro 😂😁
Poor old Kohli.  😢  But everyone is vulnerable early on. The Poms are still in trouble though.  But what happened to the remainder of Day 2?  Did it rain?  Would be nice if EWCB informed us. M 🦘🏏😎
Im so fasinated with k l rahuls batting omg .....im so mersmerized
First ball duck of kohli was EPIC
Iss baar agar 500 run se jada test series me nhi aae aur ipl me rcb nhi jeeti to seedhe se captaincy chhod dena cricket chhod dena dhoni ne bhi yahi kiya tha
Due to good bowling from both teams ,i dont think that rain of yesterday will lead this match to draw.
Why ECB removed hindi highlights?
Can Pant & Rahul Magic Happen Again just like in Oval 2018
Test cricket at it's best
Robinson and Anderson's bowling action are mostly same
When I Got To Know Anderson Was 39 I Was Mind Blown How Could one be so fit ? LIVING LEGEND
Rahuls batting was awesome... Though it is bowling pitch opening partnership was outstanding.. Keep going
💞💞💞India win 💞💞💞
Bumrah came back to form, why is Virat still struggling? Should we say he is past his prime now?
Duckholi😂😂😂😂
Jimmy Anderson's consistency is unbelievable.. 👌👏🙏
Pant vs Jimmy waiting eagerly
Why vrite gone in 0
Virat kolhi ko Purana Wala Virat kolhi banana paraga
8:34 Anderson To Pujara :-- Anderson satisfaction level after taking wicket = 30% 9:14 Anderson To Kohli :-- Anderson level = 100++% 🔥🔥  Crowd was like 🤯
Love from india ❤️💛💚💙🧡💜🖤
All the people are trolling Virat Kohli but you don't know what will happen  when the lion will Roar and that time the whole forest will be silent
Why can't the editor include ball tracking in the DRS reviews taken by the team? Any review taken causes curiousity in the viewer's mind but the editor simply refuses to show the entire length of the reviews. Please try to include these reviews in the highlights even if the length of the highlights increases by a minute or two.
Beautiful James Anderson swing
*KL Rahul is back in Form*
Being a fan telling this ...Kohli should play domestic cricket and comeback...only thing he is doing right is Acting in the  Add
𝐌𝐢𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐣𝐨𝐟𝐫𝐚 𝐀𝐫𝐜𝐡𝐞𝐫
Missing The Old Kohli
Kohli should respect the conditions, like rohit and rahul did for big time at the crease!
I hope our middle order will comeback in 2nd innings... poor performance by Pujara and Kohli...
ecb removed yesterday's Hindi commentary video and did not upload today's Hindi commentary video.
The middle order is collapsed ,but people only talk about virat,anyway virat will comeback
i got depressed for 2 hours when kohli got out on first ball🤒🤒
Most overrated player virat kholi is just a huge failure.
Ecb now start making full ruff covered stadium 🤣
Rahul fans like the comment
Kohli is all talk no show time for Kohli to retire and focus just on his endorsements 🤣🤣🤣
Kohli is flop for the last 2 year
Very very happy to see KL Rahul and bumhrah wt a top class comeback 🔝
When virat had get married he couldn't show his classs😂😂😂😂
Anderson what a bowler!!! What a legend!!! One of the most feared bowler 🤘
9.19sec That foolish face he makes Everytime he gets out earlier...
Kohli is not perfoming in test cricket  for long time now . Once in while 50 plus score is not enough. Also on crunch moment  he always crumbles . Ducks in champion trophy final ,world cup semifinal, barely 44 in world test championship   , the list gose on and on . As captain  also he yet to won single icc tournament.  Dhoni was more focus on game and humble so succeed kohli is more of drama queen and arrogant sk success eludes him
Kohli Lanka golden duck
England England England
9:16 🙄
amazing
Look at the Celebration of Virat King Kohli Wicket 😂😂😂
Kis channel pa chl rha ha match btao koi
well played rahul
04:16 Same bowl he did to Dinesh Kartik,  but this bowl didn't get swing.
Never compare Pujara with Dravid. 👎👎
Dear Anderson why don't you hit on kohli face?
Virat kohli is not virat now😕😟🥺🥺....hello virat we are waiting for your hundred
Focused and confident kl Rahul with good techniques my favourite 👍👋
KL was little bit unlucky to get run out!
KL Rahul reminds me "Viraj Sharma" from movie DISHOOM
Kohli sucks get him out a there
Best Audience for Test Matches.... 👍

The excitement when your take kohli's wicked
KL Rahul  Athiya Shetty  Lady luck
🥺🥺🥺🥺 virat sry for u man 💔💔💔
Pujara the sucker man
koliige kale iwerii den dasunge kale
I have grown old watching Jimmy and broad bowling for england
Wt is happening pujara is in bad form
What an inning from classic 🔥Kl Rahul 57* not out. 😊
kolita hoda wede
Nice highlights. Even when there was no 3rd session , an almost 13 minute highlight video is good. Even singles and doubles were shown. Appreciative 👏
Really happy to see Indian Batsmen played whole 1 Day, whereas England got all out on 1st day
K L Rahul 🌟
Kohli is finished
9:18 that happiness tells how much they fear of king Kohli ❤️
They had to make the highlights lengthy enough, about 10 minutes to earn a fat ad revenue because they know Indians will rush when the video is uploaded. Not done ECB, putting stupid singles in the highlights to make the video long enough.
If cricket was a Olympic sport India wud have still not got the gold. They will be no 1 team but nevr medals n championship. Example World Test Championship. 😂
KL Rahul proves his talent as an opener
Look at the celebration when kohli goes down
In case of hat trick against India it would be a great day for Andorson
Anderson tease him to play outside off.. Finally virat make same mistake...Omg Anderson and is swinging
Jimmy u beauty ..what's ur secret champ ? Older u get golden u become 🙏
India win 🇮🇳
English crowd when kohli get's out 😄😄😃
Jimmy - the supreme athlete of cricket !
Good to see kl batting
Some Appreciation for Rohit I think He gave a good start to team and we know 36 is not less in England looking at the conditions
Everybody : You can't play cricket forever as a fast bowler  James Anderson : Hold my balls
Waiting for Virat pair🦆🦆
You can directly catch Kohli wicket at 09:15
That's why Jimmy Anderson is the best red ball Swing Bowler in the World.
Watching Kl Rahul in white joursey again is joy to watch 🤩
Now I realised india should have played with Hanuma Vihari in place of Jadeja.
Hhhh virat 0000
VIRAT KOHLI HAS NOT SCORED A CENTURY MORE THAN A YEAR.........I WANT KOHLI TO IMPROVE HIS BATTING AND SCORE A CENTURY IN 2ND INNINGS....BEST WISHES FOR YOU KOHLI......U CAN DO IT
Guys.... It happens sometimes for players and I think we should support virat kohli
Replace Robinson with Wokes and see the results!
if rohit plays all thr five tests matches, we can surely see some big runs coming and not justs hundreds but 150s or 200s
Rahane Bhai test khel Raha hai Tu do bar bacha runout se fir akhri me rounout hi hua,,waste of wicket bro
Paddu (Jadaja) world ka Sabsa khatarnak khilari ha aj dibble century maraga
Kohli kohdi tha h ha aur rahega Kohdi century mara 000🤣🤣😂😂😂🤣😂
India are comeback strongly 🇮🇳
Virat dismissed 🤣
Very good👍 cricket and very good👍 cricket🏏 loving❤️ crowd
50 per cent spectators include Indians only I strongly feel that!
India crowd  has changed a lot first they used to shout and now they are clapping and I am not liking that
@ECB For the first time I am seeing a poorly edited highlights package from ECB - At least twice the commentators were cut off mid-sentence in the edit. Otherwise generally the highlights from ECB are the best...!
Kholi finish last 2018 England tour with golden duck and start 2021 series with golden duck
England are born for test match
What was the chatting between KL and Robinson?
Highlights is too large to watch
Just pick 1-2 wickets at a short span of time India will automatically lose 2 more wickets...especially in English conditions.
12:37 first time umpire not go to 3rd umpire
Kohli ko hatao captain
My Fev batsman KL Rahul Alive😍😍😍😍
Great batting by RAHUL..
Rahul has came back as if there was no 2019 and 2020 .... His 2018 batting in English conditions have came back nicely this time as well
09:28 See English crowd after the wicket King Kohli ❤️❤️ This told how important is his wicket for england
Listen kohli smith is more better then you 😂😂😂
"Virat missed his century just by 100 runs"
There is nothing wrong with kohli’s technique or not any physical error of judgements its jst mental stage where in his subconscious mind there is just panic or thoughts that he have to score runs because of pressure of his pride or the standard he settled down of his himelf as a player nd when u got overconfidence you gonna out by yourself nd when this started happening continuously nd your mental strength is not strong enough to hold the pressure of that particular situation then you have a little bit thought in your mind always that you have to score.
Classy rahul 💥🤩
anderson is greatest bowler in the world
Message for Michael Vaughan "Indian will Win this test match".
Congratulations k l rahul for his 50👍
Rohit Sharma after playing 100 balls   Ab sref ek hi bowler mera wicket se sakta hai woh khud me hu
What a marvelous ❤️ voice of England commenteters
We all missed the New Rohit's ton
Anderson England me hi wicket le Sakta hai
❤❤jimmy.....
Kohli performance are still shameful 😞😞😔
Why chokli chasing that delivery from outside of stump 😠😠. Should have easily left alone
Virat tu captaincy chhod de tab dekh India team ka performance 🙄🙄🤬🤬
Kohli's test record  not that great  .  Steve Smith has owned a few series, ashes
Virat Kohli's era is gone
Rahul class batting
indian cricket is the last hope of asia
What... A... Classy... Inning from RAHUL ... ❤️❤️❤️ Great Entertainer..... Love U RAHUL❤️❤️....
Rohit Sharma has been out for bouncers!!!!
Anderson's excitement on dismissing Kohli for a duck was similar to Ashwin's on dismissing Smith for a duck In australia bOwlers deem it as highest prize they run around in unbounded excitement
Poojara ki jgh surya kumar yadav ko jgh do ..
Anderson to kholi : kesa dia phir
Still Jimmy is winning against kohli
India will reach 350
Rohit Sharma has played some good-looking cricketing shot
Kohli need to by by cricket..
Class of match best bowler best batsman...hawa bhi nhi lagi kohli ko.
Bta ne jab jeeta gaa india
If kohli wants to captain India,he should do so from balcony sitting as 12th man, pujara can be his henchman! Drop both
Who are the win in 1st test match reply please
Feeling sad for Virat but Anderson what a beauty
India is best in test
Will Rahul score a century today, because he is batting like Devon Conway, where he helped NZ to reach more than 350 runs and scored a Double Century. So will Lokesh Rahul do that same thing today 🤔
India's 3,4,5 is worst. All are flop, just Big names
Rahne or pujra ko india me khila do 50-60 bana kar 2-3 sal or khelte rahe ge
Jimmy -The magician., only came hre to c your spell... love from India...
We have no more hope left from kohli it's just like playing cricket with 10 players for last 2 years.
Currently Kohli is overconfident, overambitious but underperforming. He should not look to dominate the conditions instead should respect it and play accordingly.
Well played KL!
The ball to kohli was absolutely beauty Well done
The joy of kohli's wicket shows   whats the kohli is.
Arrogance and overconfidence of kohli pays off
Where are Hindi highlights
Please show LBW referral ball tracking and dropped/half chances instead of singles and doubles
Kohli को भी निकालने ka समय आ गया hai
Jemeeee is best
Another Virat Kohli classic Failure how many times he has been out in the same fashion. Trying to defend the ball which on 6 or 7 stumps what's he is  trying to show I don't know
Ye series 2014 jaisi hi jaygi kohli ki
ನಮ್ಮ ಕನ್ನಡಿಗ ಕೆ ಎಲ್ ರಾಹುಲ್..❤️❤️
Every Player Has A Worst Time Of Batting KL Rahul - Finished It Virat Kohli - He is About To Finish Hardik Pandya - He is in Middle Stage.......
Telugu vollu vunnara
Jimmy yet to complete the longest over in his career 😂
Noob virat
Rahul baeting is nic
Kholi is always king of cricket whether he score or not
The Great Jimmy Anderson is back 👍👍👍
I think KL Rahul ERA start 👍
DISCLAIMER : '' ENGLAND CROWD WILL GIVE U GOOSEBUMPS " 😁😁😁
Virat Kohli in last 9 test innings scored 229 runs with an average of 25 and scored only 2 half centuries ..... ASHWIN in last 10 innings - scored 267 runs with average of 29 and one century
Virat can come
Is it tym to look someone ahead of pujara. He is not at his best. Needs to work out his techniques. Again good starts failed to convert by rohit.  Kohli century drought will continue dont worry. This series will be like 2014 series for him. Rahane again needs to play very cautious. Not to get out like that. But good sign is Kl rahul. Batting beautifully. Looking for a hundred from him
Anushka maregi aaj☺
0 (1)  Virat Kohli the kapptaan😂
Rohit couldn't keep his instincts on check....It is important in these condition especially that there is a "settled" batsman. Especially in these forecast condition where the best of the best batsmen has fallen prey in the past as well. Glad that KL is back in form. Can't takeaway anything from the Eng bowlers Jimmy thrives in these conditions and can see why he is still the gun bowler for England in tests.
Kohli next innings make double century
After the born of vamika, Can't see a King right now🧢🤦‍♀️
Old kohli and Anderson are back .........let's see whether kohli can make a century in this 10 innings
Outstanding opening partnership. ......and then worst batting by indians....this is ridiculous. ...indian bowlers took the wickets and indian batsman 😄😄.this was not a extraordinary bowling of Anderson .indian batsmen threw it
Virat is a noob in India also in aus and in eng and nz also he is a bunny to swing bowling he can't play a swing delivery even a 10 year kid is bowling to him🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Virat Kohli la argent hot
रहाणे तो अब सुपर हीरो है बस बैट से बॉल लगा मतलब उसके लिए रन है उसको भी झाट उखाड़ने में लगाओ
Kohli khud KO god smjhne lg gya. Practice match khelta nbi
Great to watch both our openers ❤️❤️😍
Kohli now duck out but he sure win coming this series and world cups he really good captain Indian cricket team
Skills showcased :How to lose a match when there's every chance to win the game - Featuring Indian Cricket Team
Kohli should be dropped . He is not scoring since last 2 years.
4:05 crazy xyz's brother spotted 😂
Rohit Sharma's dismissal = my heartbreak 💔💔💔
पुजारा को अब झाट नोचने में लगाओ अब वह पहले जैसा बैट्समेन नही रहा
Rain saved india from a collapse yesterday 🤕🤕🤕🤕
While i appreciate the highlights ,,, cutting out everything and just the deliveries make this a very monotonous highlights package ... Cricket Australia does a nice job of including some niceties that happened in between the game which makes it more likeable than this package
India is such tough team i. Test format
India will win 🇮🇳 ❤️
Practice woh kya hota hai bhai... England mein ghumna hain toh bolo.........
that noise from everyone when virat was out shows how dangerous he is
I hope india scores atleast 200🙏🙏
पुजारा को अब झाट नोचने में लगाओ अब वह पहले जैसा बैट्समेन नही रहा
Ruko jara sabar karo KL is still here🦁🖤✨
It's wonderful to see Jimmy picking wickets at this age but there's nothing much to woory about for India and INDIA will take lead..    INDIA INDIA. COE ON INDIA
Jimmy chala ja chala ja
K L Rahul has a technical fault. His bat during backlift is too close to his body, over middle stump. He needs to move the toe of the bat towards 2nd slip in order to play straight better and look less awkward.
Okh fine let's see you Jimmy in 2nd innings..........
feeling bad for captain kohli....
*KL Rahul's life comes full circle in England*
kohli is not exactly struggling but he is struggling
King will be back 💯
Virat Kohli's technical flaws got exposed again. Chasing a wide delivery outside the off stump with an angle bat face. Result is a nick behind the wicket.  He needs to get his head over the ball, move that front foot across outside the off stump, get close to the ball and play close the body. For God's sake play with a straight bat. Learn to LEAVE balls outside the off stump as well.
If pujara fails again and again then it's a goodbye I don't even remember when a good innings came from pujara😐😐😐😐
Bangladesh is playing 5 match T-20 series with Australia. Here Bangladesh leads the series by winning 2 match.  Today Bangladesh will lost Australia in 3rd T-20 International and will win the series.  ✌️✌️✌️
Rain Rain go away Come again another day plz... Plz....  Bez I really  enjoy every second to watch dis test cricket India vs England both of them r Strong team yahu... Common India
Virat Kohli should quit captaincy Bloody worthless captain ever!
KLASSY RAHUL
Thanks for England and Wales board team for providing updates on time. Appreciate for your work
Test cricket looks more awesome in England❤️✌️
India Ko harana bahut mushkil but BCCI playing 11 hamesha galat chose Karti h jiske wajah se India harta h  Best playing 11 from recent performance  R.sharma (C) Kl.rahul V.kohli S.yadav A.rahane R.pant (WK) H.pandya R.ashwin D.chahar M.shami J.bumrah  Best 11 for India by recent performance but BCCI chose always wrong selection like  In wtc final they choose gill in place of kl Rahul the best class batsmen recently  Pujara is in worst form in place of Pujara they can give chance like a s.Yadav , i.kishan but they can't this is the reason for India bad performance in middle order or in wtc final  Too much disappointed 😥
That cherry ko kohli 🔥
చెత్త కోహ్లీ
The celebration tells it all how important is kohlis wicket
Steven Smith 🐐>>> Kooli
India and England both teams are play best both are best team and strong player's but kl Rahul is best play in this series
Golden 🦆 duck kohli
9:15 the expected after all
England crowd was so happy to see Jimmy picking king in a first ball that means how imp wicket s virat
Half credit of Kohli's wicket goes to crowd , they put him in huge pressure.  Same ponting in 2005 Ashes 😂
The noise after Virat kohli 's wicket shows that he is the real boss of cricket in today's world....
I will just bat - virat kohli
Bap bap hota hia
Pant me Kuch jyda hi over confidence hai...
We will win this match 100 %
Just listen kohli wicket crowd 9:17💔
rahane needs to improve his batting a lot
Great batting kohli .....🙏
Test cricket at its best when jimmy took virat khali's wicket
JIMMY ANDERSON DISMISED KL RAHUL ALSO BUT THE CATCH WAS DROPED AT SLIPS. AWSOME👏👏👏👏👏👏
Wow what a great bowling by James Anderson
Nv marav kholi ninnu captain nundi thisthane neeku buddi vasthadi, bowlers nayyam nekante 10 runs anna kodtharu
Rohit departs his favourite shot Kohli departs his favourite shot. Something gonna wrong 🤔
Just wait and watch my innings today 😉
kholi vs anderson ..anderson won
Can Anderson dominate virat in whole series?? 🙁👇
Worst highlight ever 😥😥
Tell virat to learn from Babar how to play against swing ball
Indian bowlers - we will win Indian batters - hold my wicket 😂🤣
Jimmy is legend😍
Virat got out but jimmy Anderson got the wicket ... mixed emotions
Kohli Ko Aab sanyashi le lena chahiye
Duck is Temporary for someone 😁😁😁😁😁
That celebration of Anderson after dismissing the best player in the world is classic. He knows tat wicket was the key and how important it was.
The best is the opponent and crowd reaction after virat wicket ❤
Aur beta kohli apni biwi ko jab jab tour mai le k ayega tujhe jayadatar 0 milega ab ja k amlet bana k kha jana
For India 🖕
Anderson Awsm player
Single run why try u in a test match my favourite Rahane 💯 ggggg 🥰
Why Rohit, Rahul n Pant in team? They are not test players. Shikhar, Manish Pandey n Aggarwal needed in team.
The first test Cricket  we our big fan KL Rahul depend on u to lead this fist innings Common 🇮🇳
Maintenance of Anderson 😲
Lagta hai kohli aajkal anushka ke gendo se jyada khelta hai- Legend SUNIL GAVASKAR!
Virat Kholi should let Captaincy go off from Test Match format.  Too much for him to handle and at the Individual capacity a complete Flop Show.
What jimmy is doing as a fast bowler at this age is extraordinary at this age of time many players retired or play in T20 but jimmy is something else 6 over spell just GOATs things
Lolly kohli 😂
Jimmy man... 🔥🔥🔥 You're absolute legend... And that england. Crowd ❤️❤️❤️ oh godddd you guys make the test match as alive as a treasure for me😍...love from India🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
Anderson: apna time ayega bola tha na
Kholi sirf ghr ka player hy bahir es Ki bhn nikal jati hy
Any FANS OF JAMES ANDERSON  💥. Fast bowlers love JAMES ANDERSON ❤💙😀👍
Indian team gives his big wickets as a gift
1 economy of Anderson and Robinson and 4 of broad
We want series behalf of losing a womens hockey match against england.comoon india🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
Leave everything aside....what decisions are umpires making? So many wrong decisions???
Rohit sir 200 banao
Kohli is not good enough see wht he played against NZ... Rahane rohit deserve to be a captain...
Virat should retire from test cricket
I think many people  from INDIA 🇮🇳 are following ENGLAND CRICKET  🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏏💯
Fair to say india's no 3,4,5 have become walking wickets.
Reporter: how to tackle Anderson. Virat: I will just bat.....one ball thank you very much.
This is my morning dose with tea😀🤣
man kohli really need  to put up atleast 6 centuries this series plz do it
Semma kk rahul
Pujara ko baher nikalna chahye team sa
The excitement that Anderson had while taking Virat's wicket... shows the greatness of the legend Virat.... He will comeback mark my words❤
That's the power of kholi....
Rahul is doing great
Kannur Lokesh Rahul just lit🔥🔥💕
only watching this series to see the fine legend Jimmy Anderson bowl. what a legend. those balls that got pujara and kohli.. absolute peach !!!
Robinson : You will hit me aa. Rahul : Teri maa!! 😎😎
Comments comparing dhoni virat and rohit bruh like everyone is Best On their own That's why they are in top 11 We Need Unity bruh it's Team Game Not Single Player
Jimmy oh jimmy, Exciting series await Kohli vs Anderson
Jimmy Anderson is really greatest swing bowler of all time 💓
If Jimmy maintains his form and fitness for 2 yrs he would definitely cross even Shane Warne's 708 wickets too
Is that robinson was banned from cricket?how can he play now
Kohli Pujara should took retirement
The old kl ragul is back
KL Rahul🔥🔥🔥
If virat is India's best England have Jimmy anderaon
10:56 that's just Rishab Pant being Rishab Pant Continous wickets falling, yet he goes for it
11:46 💫✨
No matter of wickets but he came he started his work . Let's cheer pant pant
We can see the celebrations of  kohli  wicket ..... How he is valuable for World Cricket.
Couldn't we get just one proper test match in England No rain, no bad light, no nothing, just cricket?
India good fight game
ये ऑली robinson तो bann था ये कैसे खेल रहा है 😂😂
Kohli will bounce back
Jimmy o jummy 💖💖💖💖💖
Rohit Sharma batting awesome
Wait bro game is not over 🔥🔥🔥
Am Excited to See Battle Between Pant vs Robinson... As have noticed Robinson is Aggressive and Pant Fearless...
Virat should retire from test cricket and only play T20. He's been really inconsistent
Why the hell they’re not showing drs reviews in highlights??
10:41 many ppl are blaming KL Rahul for this, there was no run their Rahane should have a look before dashing it all the way
Kohli🙄Huge Loss For India😠
Kl rahul
Koli ki ulti ginti shoro ho chuki hai 😆😆😆😆
KL SHOW.... . . Common champion. 😍😍
Kohli will score his 71st duck before scoring his 71st century
K L RAHUL ⭐🌟
Thanks rain for saving india
Anderson always no1
Someone tell rahane that this is test cricket
Time to drop Rohit and Rahane. They are flat track bullies.
Sir Jimmy Anderson... That's it..
It's just a string of hard luck for Kohli
Rahul is best batsmen in current indian team in all formats❤
Rishabh and KL let history repeat their self 😶
Rahane run out practice 😲🤩😍
Where are king kohli fan now your king kohli on duck
Have a look at kohli's wicket.. And celebration of eng
Footage of unnecessary singles are aired in this highlights video, while decision reviews that are important moments haven't been recorded for telecast. Awful!
Where is corona....😲😲😲
9:20 Look at that pity face of 🦆rat 😆😆😆😆
Solid performance by KL awsome i hope he converted in to hundred
James Anderson bowls well Kl Rahul batted well.
Robinson's action is a bit like hazzlewood's.
Who will win this match? 1.Rain-like 2.Ind or Eng-Comment
Virat is a ordinary batsman...  He faced only worthless bowlers
English Crowd 😍
Robinson bowling style. Look like hezelwood
This is first time for single highlight
What we expected to see : Kohli's first centuary after 2019.  What we see : Kohli's first Golden Duck after 2019 😂
Hail JIMMY the Fabulous ANDERSON❤️
Pujara is a not fit in this team .overdefencing player 😠😠
Kohli & Anderson rivalry 2014 = Anderson {4 times} 2018 = Virat kohli  2021 = Anderson 1 time & continues...........
Virat kohli has done mistake  of 2014  on Jimmy Anderson bowling and now  in 2021 on Anderson bowling only
I believe more in our no. 6,7,8 than no. 3,4,5 in this match. Lord Shardul will play good today
India will win
Ha ha pant teesre din Anderson ko tokhega🤣🤣🤣
Plot twist - kohli is searching Jimmy Anderson's fitness trainer😂
Pujara,kohli your failures so hurting to me pls comeback by stronger
End of kohli era😢
☁️☁️🏏🔞🙂
That Virat kohli Wicket celebration is lit💙
Kohli : I will just bat😂😂
Well done kl Rahul. Disappointed with kohli and rahane.
Anderson makes my day✌
I'm big fan of Virat Kohli Sir. Day - 2  unbelievable Duck-out😳🥺😭💔😞 Once again prove Jimmy Anderson sir👏 Age is just a number ☝️
Anderson is an Absolute legend. He proves that age is just a number🙌😥
King Kohli is plotting his revenge quietly and impatiently
Kohli Vs Anderson rivalry continues....
Quality of highlights is not up to mark.
Stuart broad looks like a variant of Loki 😂
Kohli out is well left Ball and Pujara out is straight drive ball. They both not witnessed the ball. Rohit in top class form. Unfortunately bounce ball got him wicket. Rohit improved all one thing Is want to change above head bounce ball. He want to well left that but he played nice innings. Hope he make big in second innings
As soon as the clouds arrived that man arrived.
9:17 what a fucking sound from the England fans . Uhhhhhhhhh they needed Virat wicket as the biggest one . King will raise back 😍
Anderson 🐐
india 220 + 🇮🇳
Kohli missed his century by 100 Runs only.
KLRahul and Rishabh are there , hope to see some big hits 😍😍
Every time pujara going out like this
What happened to Pujara and Kohli's form 😳😳
One good thing that English fans came in huge 🙆❤️
This England tour is  going to be a nightmare for Virat Kohli
Mr golden duck 🦆 kohli 🦆🦆🦆
9:16 Feeled Bad For Kohli 😬  I Am Sured That Anushka Sharma Has Comed There To Watch Virat Kohli Batting 😂😂
Pujara isn't doing anything.
Virat Kohli's century, we all are missing...
*Rohit Sharma has again became a prey of the monster of 30's*   He was also dismissed while playing his strong shot not only once but thrice if we consider the test match against Australia , according to me if he gets a short ball he should go for a six not four
Disappointed from india batting  97/1 to 125/4 not good😏😏.. same thing happened in wtc final.. good opening start but middle order collapsed!
Kohli sir retarmant la la appp
6:47 best shot of match
The England crowd always alive test cricket.....
England and test that's the cricket. Such a good spectators around and getting applause at the right times with no sledge or hurt to anyone.  Inspiring Jammie and KL Rahuls subtle classic shots are fantastic to watch.
England crowd were following review ...
Jimmy  will retired from  cricket after breaking muthiah Muralitharan record of 800 test wickets 😀
I think if jimy Anderson will learn spin bowling he can play for 5 to 6 years more 😂
Is there anybody to step out  for Anderson  .PANTH only
Some people are born to say negative comments only....there motive is to criticize and find fault of players .....😊 Appreciate players who performs!
dosenot matter ravindra and pant will take revenge
kL.Rahul's century this match
Unfortunate rahane
England crowd looks always cool .. they know when wickets will start fall it will fall more than 2-3
Sharma gifted his wicket again but Kohli never arrived!
I want to see him in Ashes ,James anderson
Huge fan n respect for sir Jimmy Anderson......I can't forget Ur hadrick against Pakistan Jimmy.....hit 1000 wicket Jimmy........
Jai hind.
virat ko bagao bekar hai captan
Well done Kl Rahul
Need to change Indian captain
England always take advantage of there weather forecast.🙄...like this no team can win series in England....
When playing in England instead of saying 'rain stops play'. We should say 'sun stars play' when the game is on'.
Kohli lost of world
Jimmy is the best
Kohli se abbb umid hi nahi hein
My favourite  swing bowler James Anderson
Virat Kohli can start his career in bollywood ....the right time has arrived ...he has shown good acting skills in paid promoted Adds... He is soo busy in making promotions that ICC reminds him ....that he is a cricketer not an actor😂
Remove the Indian team from the equation and Test Cricket simply loses its charm.
Singles and doubles are more than reviews! Wow!
Anderson is like vampire. he ages but never changes ❤
The class of rahul is unbeatable ❤❤❤🤗🤗🤗
Rohit gets unnecessarily trolled!!!!
Last series for rahane Since start of aus series 10 test matches -  one 100 and 1 50
9:16 as 2013
Rahane was in too hurry to go back pawelion tuats why he ran
Kl Rahul will hit a century in the first innings
जो ये रोहित कोहली बोल रहे हैं उनके लिए talent से जलतें रहो कोहली ने नाम कमाया है चूतियों इसमें कोई दो राय नहीं रोहित धांसू batsman मेरा favourite है मगर टैलेंट को मानना पड़ना कोहली के भी ,,,,,,कद्र करते हम talent की उसके रही बात रोहित अपना बाँदा है mgr outside इंडिया in test 33 innings में under 30 average एक भी शतक नहीं ,,,,
What a crowd..love it
6:49 You can literally hear someone saying 'SHOT'!!!
K L Rahul is playing a wonderful innings
Very well played by kl rahul
Kamal classic kl rahul bande ki timing jabardst he yrr i love it
👍👍👍ಇಂಡಿಯಾ k l ರಾಹುಲ್
KL rahul well played👏👏👏
Feel bad for Rahane.. surely he can manage to add 50+ runs in scoreboard.
2014 : anderson dominates virat 2018 : vice versa 2021 : 1st test ,1 ball to virat,gone
Virat kohli flap hote najar aa rahe hai
Virat ghamndii esaa out hoga
Lulli
9:14
Still india can come back. Just need one good partnership. 60-70 runs will be a good lead.
Extreme hurryness to get runs caused Rahane's wicket through direct hit of Bairstow ...I think it was not Kl's fault but Rahane by himself cost him to pavilion . Anyways, love to see KL-aasic Rahul is back in red ball cricket after a couple of years ...wish he will turn it (57*) to three digits ❤️❤️
Smith was already better than Kohli in test now after the end of the series Williamson as well will leave him behind
Kohli's early wicket will cost India.
7.25 my heart break 💔
KL Rahul ✌️
They didn't show kl rahul drop catch
Oh my God!!! What a celebration it was when kohli was out by The swing master Jimmy
India :- I have king Kholi  England :-  he's not King.. he's Joker Kholi 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂..
England ground doesn't shout like this when smith gets out but shout at their best when Anderson gets kohli
Why is pujara playing in England . It's not his comfort of  domain . He likes to bat where there's no lateral movt. It's a stupid decision to play him along with rahane who seems to score once every 15 matches
Kohli's dismissal was really beautiful
Who is the editor of this highlights video.. No clip for reviews.. Not a proper end of the video.. I m Highly disappointed
The last day when kohli scored century was 23rd Nov 2019 vs bang at kolkata in India ' s 1st ever pink ball test . FEELING SAD 😥😥😭😭😭
ENGLAND CRICKET IS NOTHING FOR INDIA WAIT AND WATCH! AND THAT ROBINSON IS ACTIN TOO MUCH OK!
Ajinkya Rahane always find a way to gift opposition a wicket wheather himself or his partner. What a shame
Pull short men rohit sharma legend
Honestly I dnt understand rahane why he try to be agressive  when two wickets fall quickly..I have seen him so many times
Kohli, Pujara and Rahane had undone all the hard work done by Rohit and Rahul.
It's not about Anderson bowling, it's about Kohli batting that poor. BET he can't hit a century in this series too and it'll be 2 years without a century.
Playing 11 of 2nd test Rahul Rohit Gill Kohli Mayank Pant Axer Ashwin Bumrah Siraj Shami
Kl Rahul in good form he makes century
Virat ki weket ke Bad ENG riyaksan dekho pata He  Virat Hamara baap He 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Pujara virat rahane hasn't given any contributions
Plz upload short highlights
Do not open reply section of any comments because you will see andh bakth and toxic fans of Rohit Sharma fans btw I am also fan of Rohit and dhoni  Edit:- not only Rohit also the toxic fans of kohli too
Virat pujji Jinks disappointing 😭😭
Pant 💯
Ye all  England citizen our  one indian means thousands indan........🏆india
At the age of 39, Anderson still playing and giving bigg booms to opponent team 😮 woow just amazing 😃 love from india 🇮🇳
Kohli must come number 3
Who is here to see virat kholi golden duck
Remove kohli in test cricket and enter Surya or gill in no.4.
Virat kohli be like: Why me😂
Jimmy anderson one of my favourite bowler
Jimmy Jimmy aajaa aaajaa😁😁😁
Bcci have to take a descion on the basic of captain In test---- Rahane In odi------Rohit In t20-------Rohit
Never seen before Jimmy celebration like this
Nice kl Rahul sir ji 🙏🙏🙏
Worst middle oder ......😠😠😠 In indian cricket history
I think Pujara Career is over
KL'assy Rahul is back
Finally kohli made a new record he has scored the most DUCKS (9) by an INDIAN captain in tests😂 hats off
I'm huge Virat fan but to be honest , I think it's careless batting from him .
During this test series,  the growth of this channel will be 🔥
KING KOHLI CONTINEOUE HIS BRILLIANT FORM TO TAKE NEXT LEVEL LOL😅😅😅
Why stuart broad is not taking wickets
Indian middle order has been underperforming for quite long now. Time to look at the options now similar to the wide variety of bowling options we have.
James Anderson is not only a good bowler but also a good fielder
England well played ✌️
I'm seeing Rohit getting out for a short ball only in tests 😂
We: expecting 100 from virat  Virat:falls 100 short of his century
Wondering if in this competitive day and age, an athlete can play beyond 40.  By athlete , I mean fast-bowler, footballer, track and field, tennis players. Not batsmen, spinner, golfer, etc
Picture abhi bhakihe don't celebrate jimmi
*_wow brilliant job bira.....t kuli...😂😂🤣😂😂🖕🖕🖕_*
I couldn't see any comeback here 😔😔
Anderson Best Bowler in world
Classic kl rahul ❤
दुनिया में कुछ रहस्य अनसुलझे हैं, जैसे कि जिमी की तरह, वह इस स्तर पर अपनी फिटनेस और कौशल को कैसे बनाए रखता है।  वह हम में से कई लोगों के लिए प्रेरणादायक हैं
Legend Jimmy , love you
Throw out Rohit Sharma who always throws his wicket after good start and give a chance to any other opner. Senseless player.
Virat Kohli is still captain with dozens of failures B'coz of his fan following on instagram,  facebook and on twitter. Only
Some mysteries are unsolved in the world, as like Jimmy's, how he maintain his fitness and skills at this stage. He is inspirational for many..of us
Romba late spark comeon india make it an inningns win
After virat kohli wicket the crowd vrey loudly
Bakbash Kohli
As expected performance by kohli😏😏
Picture abhi bhakihe
"Virat kohli" the the real king....  . . . . . Of the dynasty of overacting chutiyapa
Please dont show singals in the highlights
Classic cover drives from KLRahul
Pujara plz take a rest or retirement yar Aur b bohot player hy tum sey toh kuch b na ho payega so plz take a retirement
What we expected to see—Virat's first ton after 2019. What we saw—Kohli out on a golden duck.
Abey hum test match mai waqt jaya kar rahe hai dusre countries ko dekho WO t20 series khel rahi hai WC ki preparation ke liye aur hum test aur IPL ko leke khush ho rahe hai ,September mai nz Pakistan jayega 5 t20 khelne t20 WC ki preparation ke liye aur humne last t20 I March mai khela hai koi practice nhi ho rahi .
Both team are legend❤️❤️❤️
Bad luck kohli   0🐤 out
Virat foxed by Jimmy
Wtf pant try to do😂😂
My coment may be look like tooo much but it's fact if indian selectors are selecting the team on the basis of performance then there is no place for Kohli and Pujara ..they are now playing like over defence type of cricket... Pujara is going tooo much defence cricket if you are too much defencive then opposition will always have more chances to get you out...in Kohli case his over attitude is the biggest problem for him...they both are just like a burden for the team....It's time to change the captain and we can see Kohli back again ... Don't forget how Sachin struggled with captaincy ....one most important thing if we cannot make any changes atleast change the coach ... Shastri fit for commentry not for coaching...
Pujara ko rest dena sahiye
Sr Superrrrrrrrr
Now you know why you need to continue with KL Rahul as a specialist opener ? Class ! ❤️🔥
Where is hindi highlights 😂😂
I’m a huge fan of baseball and decided to look up cricket to see what it’s about. I have no fucking idea what is happening
Hitman💝
Aged jimmy, broad r the reason for India will cross 200. Think abt Willy, wood
Why the editor has cut the review part ? So stupid
Kl Rahul 😍😍
KL RAHUL
For many of us who are over 30, athletes like Jimmy , Mayweather and Christiano ronaldo are true fitness inspiration.
Rohit's Weakness:pullshot Strength :pull shot 🙄🙄🙄
Kohli kote and Pujara ko team se out  karo
TIME has to come to replace pujara and rahane if india wanna to win this series
Kohli now can never hit 100
Now it’s endgame for pujara career
As Shameless as a Pornstar Rohit Sharma and Moron Kohli are refused to learn anything..
Showing singles but not showing reviews just England YT channel things.🙄🙄
Op rahul
8:05 why that ain't out ?
Drop kohli 🙏
Match winning 97 run partnership from R & R
James Anderson best.. England will win❤❤
Finally the highlights guy decided to show stuart broad. The persons who everyone thought that wouldn't survive these condition's was rohit and kl but the people who everyone thought will be great got out on duck and experienced persons never survived
England team game changer brother 👍
Kl Rahul is classy and best
Anyone England fans like here😁😁😁 including me
I think virat should get out of all the social Accounts and out of the reach of internet and meditate. By which he can gain mindfullness of calm and thinks on the game in more intelligence rather than emotional consciousness
Anderson always special guy , but India will fight back .
Choker luli
Test cricket in England > anything ❤️
Classic rahul
Missing the era of virat. 2015-2019
Eng feels lack of archer
ECB Target 6M Across In This Series
Super .
Is that a final delivery of T 20 of Rahane's Run Out ???
Virat 0....
Kohli at his best against the very best!
😂😂. Bechara. I.! D
I am INDIAN...but I like Anderson very much
""'Successful person always live with cool mind-MS Dhoin 💕💞
Indian win this match
Pujara's delivery was unplayable 😵 but not the Kohli's 😐 He played almost on the 6-7th stump buz of lack of runs😬
Kamal Lajawaab Rahul😄
Any one noticed KL Rahul's  “CLASS”
India
I'll just bat ❎ I'll just edge☑️
10:11 how bairstow is running 🤣😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂🤣
Skipping drs videos, u making worst videos ecb
virat kohli is the only indian captain  to have 3 golden against england  in 2014 mark wood in 2018 broad and now jimmy
Did you hear the crowd voice when Virat got out That show's the importance of the wicket.
Great test is on the cards
Rahul op
I think Kohli should again be embarrassed like anything for a huge come back. It's been 2 years since he scored a century.
இந்தியா🇮🇳🇮🇳
Now , Kohli and pujara should think about their places in test team . They have become burden on team due to their continues failure results into poor performance of team .
KL Rahul ,the enigma  How has he not become a great by now is beyond  belief.   Here is a man with all the shots, proper technique  as evident with this inning and temperament    Bat close to pad,  bat behind  him and not committing  to early to front foot.  Great approach.This could be the making  of Rahul
97/0 and I went to toilet and then 112/4 Oo bhai 😭😭😭
❤anderson from india
Rohit sharma wicket 😞😕
Kuch bhi Matlb kuch bhi 97/0 aur in 15 mins 112/4 Oo bhai maro muje maro 😭😭
Sir Jimmy Anderson....Bang on.
8:18 umpire look like Jonny sins 😂
Well played Kholi
Will virat score runs in second innings😕😕
Rishabh pant always be rishabh pant 😂
Kohli and pujara should be rested so that some youngster can replace them. We had enough of their failures.
KL fan ❤️
This should be Rahane's last series if he fails
Thakur Abhi Baki hai!
India 🇮🇳❤️❤️❤️
No doubt rohit would be a better captain
beauty of England test cricket 🏏 is only alive crowd..
I think the sad part of this match is Rahane's run out
Why there is no 'knic nightmen' in commentry pannel?? Can anyone tell me plz
There is so much class in indian batsmen, how calm and how they enjoy the game 🔥♥️ Well comeback by england day three will be crucial
Boring highlights, Aussies and star network is good
Jayaho India.. ❤️
Many people are spreading hate abt kohli and puji, we shld just admire the bowler here, puji's and Kohli's ball was next to unplayable, sometimes we shld just credit the bowler, and not criticize the batsmen.
For those who don't know. . . . . . . . Jimmy Anderson is 39 years old !
So many useless balls ECB included in this highlights despite the Catch-Drop of Rahul on 52. Clapping 👏
Even after so many years Jimmy Anderson is the main bowler all others are supporting him ,this shows his importance in the team
Everytime he's out he looks at the pitch@kohli
Ravi Sasthri is waste for Team India
By this series there will be confirmation of opener slot either for shubman gill or kl Rahul i think kl rahul is best alongside rohit sharma
I have not finished my lunch,so I got out early and went back to complete it. A hundred coming for all of you,in the next inning.🙂
Ind should take lead et list 50-100 runs Pant
Zerot Kohli
Only bowler who can beat Muralis record vil be Jimmy
Kohli is finished.Time to chuck him out of all formats of the game and bring in fresh faces!
Please show the review replays, why have you stopped doing that..? it makes no sense and ruins the highlights.. and how is Rahul scoring a single of Curran a highlight..?? wtf is wrong with the highlights person again..?
On This pitch for us 60-80 runs lead will be enough?
Still it was India's day....but what a legend! Sir jimmy🙏
England Crowd is Best in test Crucket. They are live in test match
Hats off kl Rahul England on bow now 😂😂
Highlights in 720p? That too in this day and age?? Pathetic.
Jimmy is always beauty❤❤ excellent spell from this man.... Legend
Humare Top  3 player's hi perform nhi kar rha h
The Quality of cricket provided by ECB and england crowd you will not found anywhere else...
Ind is under control with rahul and pantvon pitch
Age is just a number for Jimmy Anderson, he is still as lethal as he was in his initial days😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎
Rahane bhai ko kya hua tha kaal
Virat Kohli not a danger batsman 😂😂
NYC👍
Quallity cricket
Kl proved his place
Rohit and rahane are idiots, not sure what are they thinking some times.
Pujara Should make way for Suryakumar Jadhav  Atleast Jadhav could score some 50 odd runs per innings !! Sorry Pujara U should make way for talented SKY
Kohli poor form continues 😔
Kohli is finished
kholi bara Zabardast out huwa 😂😂😂🤣
What great.placing.of.ball.by.india.opening.pair.only.bad..shot.within90runs.when.wicket.waz.lost.
The video quality of English broadcasting channels are so much clearer than Sony LIV. Why is it so?
Kl Rahul class 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Its incredible to catch Kholi on very first ball its freaking amazing
KL Rahul💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
I don't understand the point of showing Root and Pujara's frowning faces leading upto the DRS review but not actually showing the review in the highlights.
Kholi 😥
wow india can beat england bye.
James anderson played well on ground and on dream 11
Rahul will hit 100!
Lokesh Rahul is India's best opener ever
rohit💔
Perfect catch in this when was down the first wicket
You don’t get to 619 wickets by not being a supreme athlete, our Jimmy!
Great Anderson
That Sara Ali khan ad is super annoying
i think pujara is waste in the team he is not in good form.. Plz chance to another players
Rahane Saab: apun ko shaheed hona hai...
Jimmy Anderson is the best fast bowler. His fitness and delivery action is remarkable.
Till 97-0 India was Showing pure Ranji Class Batting.
Robinson ek bar T20 me Rohit ke aage aa jaye then🥵🥵🥵
People saying it was a great bowl that kohli got out to. Indeed it was but he could also have easily left that if he judged that correctly so I would say it’s also his own mistake. Always tries to feel the bowl no matter how much outside off stump it is. Hardly leaves even in test cricket which ur supposed to be doing to threatening lines. I’d say it was just poor cricket on his part.
England vs Aryans Cricket team
Feel sad for rahane 😭
Kl Wins heart☺
I love England
Its very sad to kohli duck  😭😭😭😭
Jimmy is my favourite since childhood
pujara and kohli should get a break from indian cricket team and learn how to play more than making money
Robinson bowling like Kyle Abbott
Oh my god. Kholi. 😂🤣🤣😂😂🙏🙏🇮🇳
Look the celebration after Virats wkt
Best player kl rahul
Jimmy vs Ander(son) again  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 No Ali No Rashid No Ben Stokes  The wicket of Kohli will be shared between Anderson and Curran for sure 🤣🤣🤣🤣
England has one of the most hostile crowds in all of cricket
When playing in England ,instead of saying Rain stops play, Whe should say -SUN STARTS PLAY  🤣🤣🤣
Bowling pitch
Captain 36ao, looser Captain WTC, big panaoti!!! Its time for some looooong rest.
Hindi commentry
King kohli Wicket .. England Squad Celebrating..Hw Dangerous Kohli Was.. May Sure He will B back...
Pant Fearless Lion 🦁👑
Now time to change test captain 😂😂
At least KL Rahul faced a few balls in Anderson’s last over of the day. Poor Pant, standing at non strikers for 3 hours.
Pant is the man tomorrow... The thing kl has to do is play the way he played yesterday and let pant , jaddu , shardul play there natural game.. india is down but not out . The 1st target should be to erase the 58 run defecit and then think to move forward... Test matches and this beautiful nature of turnarounds
KL Rahul is 2nd great wall of the world
Pujara ko kisne khilaya
Please show third umpire drs review ball tracking also
*FUNFACT ENGLAND DELETED ALL THE HINDI HIGHLIGHTS 🤣🤣*
Cheteshwar man you, look in lot of strain. Cool man you're the best defensive player in team.
Virat really hated him self for playing that forward defence.. and the jubilation by team England shows that virat is indeed a great legend.. Jinx ,pujara , kohli need to bring there A game or india will never win under such tough bowling conditions
I love virat
Rahane running like he is catching a mumbai local train… gai gai gai….😁
Babar azam is a king of cricket
Clearly audible Rohit's "no,no"🙂 7:30 Giving wicket after getting set worst feeling 🙂
Virat kohli scored his last century in november 2019 against bangladesh.  This is what happens when you pay more attention to advertisement making more and more money. Every time you see 1 min add on tv you will find atleast 5 kohli ads.
Kl rahul double century chahiye 😳
england people always clapping both team player
Kl u good bat
ರಾಹುಲ್ 100 ಕನ್ನಡಿಗ
Middle order not scoring consistently is bad omen for india .....once they were the doing all India's batting and now they do nothing. Especially Pujara's angled bat shows the bad signal.
👍❤
FINALLY ANDERSON GOT KOHLI OUT AFTER 2014
Who is disappoint by virat kohli
9:15 even crowd knows that how important wicket it was....
Daily ka daal diya karo.
West off luck team 🇮🇳🏏❤️
Kl rahul played like rahul dravid 🤗🤗🤗🤗
Who wants to win india 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
Rahane LOL
No doubt one of the best crowd❤️
Poor defence by VK.
Yeah don't show reviews, but everything else 👍👍

Kl Rahul centchury
See this video how Anderson take kholi on golden duck
These highlights are very good but why aren't you showing the ball tracking and ultraedge.
WOW 😳 no Pakistanis mass trolling in comments! but but but .... why notttt? Indians bring up politics, nationalism, religion, hate and so much more that make up nearly 80% of all comments in Pak cricket videos ..... let us enjoy our videos without riling up unnecessary bs, like we let you.  actually not actively 'let', its just in our nature.
Anderson your are best 😘 you.
Virat kohli🤣😂😂🤣🤩
Same phase of sachin came of 2 years not scoring 100 and same now to Virat
Lovely to see eng v ind test series best series of all time
Virat Kohli is King Kohli . Next Match in making runs Century . Jai Hind
Rahul is the most technically sound batsman in this lineup
Virat KohliThree time duck out  vs England vs James Anderson
Joe root needs to put a short thirdman to stop easy runs against rahul
My heart broken 💔 when kholi got out
Expecting good runs from kohli has been difficult for every Indian cricket fan.
There are no highlight in hindi
"11:58 this has to be one of the longest over ever completed".
Kholi.pujara wasted in Indian cricket.. Both 2 player consisted not perfamance..
My predict...today india lead by 85-90 run.match result drawn.
Last 5 years Rahul not played test now Rahul on fire 🔥🔥
James Anderson has aged like fine wine. No doubt one of the greatest fast bowlers of all time in test cricket!"
Just like WTC and even before, it's either openers or Pant below who helps the total. Our no. 3, 4 and 5 have been disappointing for some time now.
Good to see great support for opposition even though they play against India after a long time
Anderson after taking virat's wicket 😂😂😂
Virat Kohli is in hurry always come and go
Kohi should not play test cricket more
Broad-Anderson duo might come in form tomorrow....
I think Rishabh Pant want to destroy Anderson's economy. Day-3 will be definitely different. In Day-2, we lost 4 wickets quickly......#🏏🏏🏏🏏 And Rahul is a player of big stage, he is a most aggressive batsman in Indian Cricket. We love their shots how he punches in off-side and on the ground.....
Jimmy is like abslute climax of the cricket thriller ,sweet dish for eyes..
Kohli has become THE POKE MASTER now a days
Every time when Kohli get's out he thing's what's going on 🤔and he reacts like 😱a fool
KL Class Batting 🏏🔥
Virat you are a king, you will score again we all indians are with you
Kohli when u come back?😭😭😭
It's so sweet to see a match in England...
Kohli just cant play swing and win / draw matches for India. Root n williamson are much better player of swing. Vaughan was right. If williamson was born in India,he would have been the greatest.
Jimmy rocks pujara and kholi ☝️
Great start by kholi I hope he continues his form. Arrogant idiot
Ajinkya rahane the most underconfident in the history of game 😇😇😇😇
Believe me when comes to appluad opposition team Indian fans is the most disgusting
Kohli should play some domestic cricket to regain his form
No doubt about it ....jimmy anderson is the great test bowler of all time 🤘👏
Virat Kohli's batting career seems to be ..and dat is so sad
India looking in excellent shape keep it up 👍👍
bhai ko practice se jayda photoshoot jaruri lagta hai 🤣
Jimmy Anderson. Legend.
Watching test match in England dream for many As a Indian i know Indian crowd never praise any other team But English crowd ENJOY game
Now its cricket term to go down in India I never understand why Indians are so obsessed with cricket it's one of the worst and boring game played by 2-4 quality teams. Even in WC only 2-4 teams are really good rest were just filling empty spots
Fir se Dil tuta 💔💔💔
Anderson is a world class bowler butnotfor Rishab pant😅
Glorious to watch Lover KLRahul❤️❤️😉😉
Kl Rahul is better than shubhman gill
Pujara garbage player 💩💩💩
KL u beauty! Those shots are Pleasent to watch !
Time to say good bye to Pujara
King kohli come back anderson bowling 💪💪💪💪
I am bigg fan rahul king
As usual kohli golden duck. Save India simply by a sign in VRS
Kohli  is a highly overrated player. All at sea against good swing bowling. I have never seen him score runs against class bowlers like Anderson, Pat Cummins, Trent Boult and the likes. Should be kicked out of the team
Very good batting by KL rahul he showed his class
Kushi is baat ki h rahul pant क्रीज पह
Jimmy Anderson will take retirement in 2022 mark my words 🤨.
Why is kohli alive?
Higher and higher 🤑🤑 Pant is on fire 🚒🔥 England team you should call an fire brigade for 3rd day 😂😂😂
Second day 2team favour
Please share review
*Most ducks in test cricket as Indian captain : Virat Kohli 9**
Come on pant 100
Waiting for K L Rahul century 💯💯💥
KL Rahul ia a classical batsmen  Who agree?
India win the match ❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥India supports🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️❤️
Even if Jimmy Anderson has hot two big wickets there is still a reason for England to fear as Rishab pant is still on the crese and all Rahul looks set for a big score
Who thinks Rahane out himself deliberately. He underplayed under Kohli captaincy what a loser
That run out was needless otherwise those balls which took away Kohli and Pujara were beauties
Everyone say Steyn is better than Jimmy.....But at age of 39,jimmy can maintain fitness which steyn cant maintain at age of 34.....Eventough Steyn has better records then why cant he play Test anymore......Jimmy is GOAT
Give Kohli ducks , he will give a golden ducks 😅😅😅😅
Virat Kohli best match koduthu pala varudangal aguthu
Virat kholi is nothing but trash He luckely hit some score in 2 3 matches and else nothing He is an overated cricketer oh captin
Kohli is nothing in front of Steve Smith.
Kholi duck 🦆 is really a stunning moment
Always interesting to see wen Rishabh pant on crease 🔥
All hope kL Rahul and Rishabh Pant!! Hope rains stops soon nd these both lions score good 💞💞💞💞
Now I began to hate kohli
Pujara looks like a passenger.
Loli
Give Kohli ducks, he will give you golden ducks 😂
All hope on kL Rahul and Rishabh Pant!! Hope rains stops soon nd  these both lions score good!!💞💞🔥🔥
It's about time for Kohli, Rahane and Pujara to perform... it's about time...
Pls remove pujara and rahane for next match they both r fadeout 👍 Bring surya and iyer they both perfect replacement for pujji rahane
Clothes in cricket - Lungi , Tye , Pant , Short and the person who made them is Taylor 😂😂-
The Anderson and Kohli rivalry continues a new chapter starts💥
Love form India ❤️❤️❤️
आयपीयल चा पैसा लय झालाय हेनला
Wow KL Rahul Class ❤️
overrated player by Indian fan  sharma and pujara ||
This is not the Virat Kohli I have seen play throughout the years, This is not the Virat Kohli with above 50 average in all 3 formats, This is not the Virat Kohli with 70 centuries, This is not the Virat Kohli I have idolised, This is not Virat Kohli...😭😭😭😔😔😔
Pant: Anderson broad hoga apne ghar ka
Ducklolli...🤣🤣
Rahane.  What’s wrong it’s him.
Dk commentry is ❤️❤️❤️❤️😍😍😍😍
See crowd when kohli out
We miss u  Sehwag  in Test matches.
Cricket taught me one thing stay calm don't get overwhelmed. Just stay calm
Cheteswar puara out @eng player 🤞but when virat out @😃👌🤞🙏😮all reaction
2nd day match was very interesting and enjoying however Anderson turned out danderous for india but  Rahul makes india proud and Kohli as always trying for 100 and trail by 100 run😊.
Such a classic drive by rahul
Goat 🐐  Anderson
Jimmy anderson what a fine fitness even at the age of 39🔥🔥 619 test wickets # many more to come # Sir james anderson
Tomorrow pant will score 5 more runs and will get out. India all out 145. England lead will be 150 with 7 wickets in hand 😀😀😀
The peak form of kohli is over....
9:20 virat be like  Ab fielding krni padegi ek ball khelke
India to won
look at the crowd go crazy after kohli"s wicket
Is the BABY keeping kohli up. HA,HA 🐣go jimmy do the BIZZZ on him 😁😉
Jimmy oh Jimmy the skill you you possess is unparalleled. Lovely to watch
Are you here for this 9:14
ROHIT - RAHUL = t20 ROHIT - DHAWAN = ODI ROHIT - RAHUL = TEST         ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Earlier I was yours big fan but not now
Kohli has not changed with bat from wtc final to england.
Golden duck kohli😂
Jimmy Anderson ❤️ is like  fine WINE .
plz down your attitude and improve your performance
Best way to start your day :- when you get up early in morning and you got ecb highlights recommendation.
Kohli 1 ball catch out😕😕😕😔😔😔
Nice match❤❤❤
Virat plz take more rest now you are not ready to play
Superb batting by  shri cheteshwar ji pujara
Hii
Pujara ni intiki pampandra Babu enduku Inka adanistaru vadini
Please show DRS reviews
Gold for Kholi not in olympics but in Cricket...😜
Looking at my man virat struggling is really hard to watch.  Let's hope that he regains his supremacy soon!
The Legendary indian cricketers are 100% perfaction and strong played test match cricket... opponent team are allout 183-190 & india scores in scoreboard:-500,600,650(sehwag, Dravid, sachin, ganguly and this legendary players on the mark 100+ & 200+ partnership & won the test match cricket and series.  And Jimmy andorson are legendary English bowler and he is a every matches excellent outstanding bowling performance....  Jimmy andorson (2003-2021) :- Jimmy andorson the takes brilliant 7-43 vs New zealand in 2008.
Don't even like reading the comments. I can't beleive my eyes. This toxic fans divided each other as if the players have told them to do so. I thought things have changed and so does the mentality. And yeah please don't reply me if you are one of those toxic guys.😩😩
This pandemic has deteriorated Kohli's performance severely. I miss him making centuries 😔
2:40 first bowling change😂
एक लाइक इंग्लैंड की दर्शको के लिए तो बनता है
Pujara is not even close to the legend Rahul Dravid.
मुझे तो सिर्फ इंग्लैंड में ही cricket अच्छी लगती है ये हमको बताते है को क्रिकेट कितना खाद खेल है अगर  क्रिकेट को कोई जिंदा रखता है तो वो इंग्लैंड है
Last  time(IND VS ENG 5TH TEST 2018) when these two (rahul-pant) stiched an unbeleivable patnership both of them scoring supreme centuries waiting to see that aggressive patnership from this duo
""JUST IMAGINE HOW MANY SUBSCRIBER'S IS COMING HERE EVERY SECONDS AND MINUTES AND HOUR'S😘😘😘😘😘
🤣zero
What about pujara, he cant play
Can't understand how long can Jimmy Grandpaa will play ???
We should drop Rohit in test, his contribution 20, 30 only..
Nothing more has changed in the test cricket ,today boys have different style to play it but it has the same taste as before ..✌️
Kohli's form has fallen after 2019 WC just like Sachin's form fell after 2003 WC. It took him 4 years to get back in touch.
Bhai virat kohli tu pichle 2 saal se kr kya rha h tere se Deepak चाहर और ठाकुर अच्छी बैटिंग kr rhe h
Abbh comments Mai kuch Pakistani aur uneducated loog Dhoni vs Kholi vs Rohit karegye.
I always  knew kohli is jimmys pet
7:30 same mistake he made in Sydney test after scoring 50   He is doing really well but playing bad shot at wrong time
Aaj Hind highlights nhi aayi
Where is gary ballance from english side
Lone ok l
I think in England old people watch test cricket only cricket they are just passing their time 🤣🤣
Jimmy andreson was phenomenal ageless.. Perfect swing bowler of all-time..❤️❤️from India ❤️❤️
Watching highlights only for jimmiy
India should look beyond Pujara. He's making to look decent balls as an extraordinary balls.
We are Indian cricket ok😁😁   Not England cricket 😁 Like karo jo jo indian hai..🇮🇳😘
Well played kohli
He's on the take that rahane. How obvious is it
Other watch cricket I watch cricket n Crowd too
Who is missing kholi's hundreds😔
1 30+ score from either jadeja or pant or thakur and India are almost there.
I think Virat kohli time's out.
Today india will score more than 400 and England will be all-out less than 100... India win by innings ❤️❤️ lead 1-0
Jimmy getting Kolhi right after Pujara has   vibes of Shoaib getting David and Tendulkar at Eden Gardens
G.O.A.T 🐐In tests 🙏🏻Jimmy❤️
Why I love test cricket. All 4 seam bowlers grafting away for a break through. Robinson bowled beautifully all day and was eventually rewarded. Then Jimmy showing his class. And then the roar from the crowd after his second. Sports is nothing without fans
Nice play India
Jimmy is Roger Federer of Cricket ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Support to England from 🇧🇩
Wanna see pant vs Anderson tomorrow 🤔
Change your editor dear ECB
Pant always on fire 😂
If you use kl rahul wisely in nz series and wtc final results would be different.Ofcourse now team India treating south part of India players differently .They paid that in form of wc 19 by selecting kids like panth instead of rayudu and now selecting prithvi shaw and gill instead of rahul and mayank in wtc
♥️🏏🏏
Ab virat kohli ko sirf adds hi kr pta he 🙃 Batting nhi krta hai aur practice bhi nhi krta, 🤭
Man how many times has Sharma gotten out cheaply like that? He can't catch a break.
Anderson.....bowling Level👍👍❤
Jimmy on the fire🔥🔥🔥
I think kohli should rethink about his form disappointing very much. highest paid captain.irresposibility.
sibley is the most useless player. Can’t bat and more drops in the slips then he has caught. If rahul was out too. India were in trouble
Indian batsman will comeback 😘 Come onn...👍
Please show ball tracking in DRS
beauty of batting....KL Rahul 🙏🙏🙏
Opening has improved a lot in overseas they gave best start 97 runs but unfortunately middle order could not captalise it
@4:06 CSK fan 😍😎😍😎
K L Rahul aka Rahul Dravaid.......
Jimmy's action gives him extra bounce.
Kohli past his prime of 2016. Needs to stop being so arrogant and needs to spend more time focused on cricket and not trimming beard and doing ads on insta, if he wants to have a longer career cause this past few years he has been horribly bad. Except for the odd paytm series 😂
Rahane and run out ☹️
Test cricket me run out , galat disisun rahane
How we know the Nottingham crowd is awesome: the last two balls were after the second rain delay, and they were really cheering Jimmy in!
Kholi ko team mese nikalo
Khela hobe
Jimmy u r so handsome.. Just love ur fitness
english weather will interrupt more play tommorow and we didn’t even get 90 overs on day 1 due to over rate which means it could be a draw
1:01 show the hawk eye then. Highlights used to be good. Now they are poor
Unbelievable fitness  at 39..jimmy you're a living legend..
haahah indian just a home tigers ...look at the virat perfomence.... Virat must take a some Tips from Babar Azam....
did you know. Kenya bowler Steve tikolo has 50 in odi wc knockout yet our chocker loli has none, Choku in knockout events average of 12. 5 ducks in icc event for King Kohli. no century in 2 years for King Kohli, mitchell starc higher average then chokli in icc knockout  LOLI CONCENTRATE MORE ON TRIMMIMG BEARD AND SAYING BENCHOD THEN PLAYING.  In loli captaincy ind humiliating loss and rcb lose every seasons yet chcocku fans screaming EE SALA CUP NAMDE ROHITMAN 👑 CAPTAINCY MI WIN 5 TITLES IND WON ASIA CUP  YET AGAIN KING KOHLI PROVES HIS PROWESS WITH ANOTHER GOLDEN DUCK WHEN ROHIT HAD DONE ALO THE HARD WORK GETTIN THE BALL OLD
What a poor show by pujara rahne and kholi Pujara ko ball bhi dekthe  hainkya har jagah body  line kha raha hai Rahane kitne baar  runout hobraha hai recently  And rohit sharma not converting  the good starts  Yeh kya test match khel rahe bhai
a hundred for kohli in ENgland ;P
Good thing is Kohli not reviewed
Love to watching Virat Kohli another great innings ...!!
Why am I watching singles? I want to see boundaries and wickets in a test match highlights
Eng 183 Ind 224 Eng 176 Ind 136/7 Ind win by 3 wickets..........(1)   Eng 183 Ind 160 Eng 180 Ind 170/10  Eng win by 33 runs.........(2)  I still think if Pant scores a quick fire 40 and Rahul scores atleast 30 more, Ind will win the test
Kohli already destroy his career by becoming vegetarian his bad decision of becoming vegan will haunt him through out his career look at his performance after he becomes vegetarian his focus and stamina reduce drastically he struggles to get even 1 hundred one by one poor performance consistently at one time i thought he is the only batsman who can break Sachins record now he struggles to even get a 30s and 50s.non veg is extremely important for an athlete he lacks a complete diet which is veg as well as non veg.
Duckholi 😂 😭😭
Who is better test batsman Root In india Or Virat in England  Kohli in England  Matches 12  Innings 23 Runs 784 Average 34.08 Hundreds 2 Fifty 3 Ducks 4  3 of them golden ducks   Root In  india  Matches 10 Innings 20 Runs 952 Average 50.10 Hundreds 2 Fifty 5 Duck 0
कोहली भैया कब चलोगे एक अरसा हो गया तुम्हे अच्छी बैटिंग किए हुए किसकी नजर लग गई पता नही।
No offense, no disrespect. Isn't it Broad who got 6 sixes by Yuvi in 2007. Wow this dude is still playing. Baller from his time like S.Vas, Numan Kulsikra, and so many already took the retirement. He's so fit but they should also give opportunities to new England players.
Queen kohli😶
& today's highlights were quite good (as compared to highlights of matches against Pakistan)
K. L. Rahul is bating
That over from Jimmy! The contrast between his and Kohli's reactions is extraordinary.
Kohli every time next time he is over... he is so overrated an people have  made him hero for no reason in past 2 years  he had not made a single century against any team in test match its time for get him replaced but people wont understand pujara kohli an rahane they all are good for nothing why any one should support such mediocory in sports
Wtf rahane is always in a hurry to be run out
Klass of KL Rahul ❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥
The england Crowd always alive the test cricket
Again Rugby person is Editing Cricket Highlights 🤬🤬🤬
Pant is looking in good touch. I hope he scores a big hundred along with Rahul ❤️
Watched Rahul Straight Drive *6:48* at 0.25x & Still Glorious !
9:20 , boss yahan mushkil ho rhi ha🤣🤣😅....
I don't understand why England would have no third slip. KL would've been out and England would've stopped many fours. That is bad captaincy. Same thing happened in Australia, where Paine didn't have a fourth slip when Starc was bowling.
The secret is fish and chips and a gallon of brew😎
What a beautiful test match
Why pujara and rahane in the team? Gill and ayyar should play in the team instead Otherwise nothing more is expected from this team
Kl 100  Pant 65  Jadeja 50  Coming up
Fitness of Jimmy at his age 😮🔥
Jimmi Anderson you beauty
What’s going on with Jinx? His brains seem a bit scrambled with it comes to quick runs. He should take a Xanax or something before he comes on to bat.
Jimmy Andersson the "God Father" of Swing! Thank you Sir
Virat before 2020 was a dangerous nowadays he is😭
Does anyone notice England jersey is more yellowish 🤔
Bullshit middle order can't even score 10 runs being so much experienced as well.  Poor middle order batting ...
Facts:last 10 years, india, in England in test, 12 loses, 2 wins. Now, viral kohl's record, as a captain in "SENA" , against, South africa:1to 2, against England 1 to 4, against nz, pathetic, to say the least, 0 to 3, yep, against aus, 2 to 2, last year after, nightmare of "36", thank God, he left, rest u guys, know,history
Thanks For sharing and Jimmy is awesome ☺☺☺
Aajkal t 20 odi se jyada mja to test match dekhne me aata.. If bowlers dominate.. Then it's become more interesting
Pujara doesn't succeed in conditions with moving ball. Why? Ball never stops moving and even it stops a new ball is due by then.  Should he be dropped from test team?? No. Change position.swap him and Rahane or him and Rohit.
Kl shows his class  Bad luck for Rohit and rahane  Kohli vs Anderson 🔥 Pojara seems clue less  Amazing opening partnership and what a comeback by england
For the services to Cricket, England should award him CBE once he retire's and I am confident the Queen will do it. Waiting to see the day- Sir James Anderson!!!
Very sad to see Kohli going back to 2014 after all the hardwork of 2018.
Whats happened to the Middle order of all test teams. Where are the Laxmans, the Martyns and the Bells.
Pant over smartness will cost India this match.
This kholi fans are frustrated after he got out of golden duck... Please choke by that zero which virat got and don't compared and enjoy the beautiful cricketing by kL.
Well done India, keep rocking 👍👍👍
𝗕𝘼Ꮶ 𝗕𝐶 Ꮶ𝐎𝗛𝗟𝗜
Jimmy Andreessen living legend  Cant believe he is getting better and better . I dont think anyone will surpass his test wickets.
Even without the commentators being cut off mid-sentence, this would be the worst edited set of highlights I've ever seen. Please at least pretend to put a bit of effort into it?
Vk...is sch a chu...
Instead of kohli they should bring club cricketer he will do better than kohli
Jimmy is keeping the Match alive and interesting unlike the ill-spirited English batsmen. They lacked intent and showed zero commitment. Excuse Joe and Sam
virat coming down batting performence to be continued. fans are felling very bad.😔
Michael Holding commentary is music to the ears.
9:15 what a moment..kohli shines!
Pujara is the poop of Indian cricket
How does an Indian batsman turning Curran to leg for a single make the final cut for highlights of the day? What?
Which this play channel?
Come on England ❤️n support from 🇵🇰
👍👍👍
The players and the English crowd's excitement after Kohli's out shows how important that Wicket was.. Jimmy you beauty , good 2nd day
Kholi entry😎 Kh0li performance💩
Hopefully Anderson will be able to cross 700 wickets n overtake warne before he retires ,Murali 800 wicket record is safe though  ,only spinners were able to achieve this feat so far when he overtakes kumble by taking his 620th  wicket
Feels like editing is done by someone who is leaning it now.
Pujara, Kohli, Rahane is the most overrated middle order ever.
If Anderson plays 3 to 4 years more than I think Murali Record can be broken.
Run-out in test ?  rahane needs to step up in this series
Juxt Noise says that who's the King(Virat Kohli) in Cricket love From Pak ❤ Luv u boii Virat Kohli
Watch the video @ 2x  ..  beleive me...
Get Nick Compton to save the top order blues
2:24 some Aussie fans in the crowd cheering for india maybe 😀
is Anderson 40?
Rarely can see rahane run out......!!!!!!
3:34 Broad suddenly remembers Yuvraj
Waiting for pant Strom
11:12 at 0.5x speed...Olympics race is going on
Foundations are excellent.  Pillars are crashed. What a stupidity? Better to found instead of pujara.
greatest leave by pujara .......
KLass is permanent
Cricket gand me dalo ab . Olympic medals ka craze hai ajkl
Does ECB has problem with DRS? Why they are not showing it?
Anderson is the best Test bowler of century along with dale styn
No one talking about rahane run out
Rahana was running as if he wanted to be out
India's batting surreal to start, now in  de javu mode..
It seems kohli's Tommy enough to runs! Become worthless past 2 years. Rahul you beauty the gladiator of Indian squad.
ABHI THO GAME BAKI MERE DOST........ INDIA IS... FET BACK TO GAME CHANGES...... RISHABH PANT.......
Good England
Big thank you for showing these highlights
Kohli u can't broke my heart 🙄
Pure match ki vaatt laga di...kitna acha start mila tha. Pujara can't play like this...Has to score warna nikalo
I was told Rahane had a hamstring issue, stupid guy 🏃🏾‍♂️was running like it’s the Olympics. When will SKY or Vihari get a chance if guys like Pujara and Rahane are not dropped. Both Pujara and Rahane need to get some coaching inputs from either SRT or Dravid soon. It’s so evident that consistency or their batting prowess don’t matter,if you have strong political connections ..
good English time
Golden duck for kohli😆
Good work by ECB for putting up highlights for free.. Bcci learn something from other boards. Corrupt indian bcci only know how to make money.
love u love u jimy....
Virat class is over now its time for rahul.stay home virat😃
Rohit been a soil of MUMBAI .....HEwill NEVER GIVE UP BOSS
you guys really need to change your editor or stop making highlight.
😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆
Rohit after making 30+ in test guys i need one short ball i will give you catch for sure 😔😔
Anderson  he has a  class of his  own  Without him england is TOOTHLESS TIGER
Virat Kholi is so much over rated
Sponsors on test tshirt is disgrace to cricket .
Eagerly waiting for virat to lift his bat and helmet 🥺🥺🥺😟
9:15
English crowd is the best crowd in the world 👍👍👍
Surprise to see England crowd no one is wearing mask ?or any social distance
Pujara should be more confident ... He is the boss of test matches
please have intros and better edited higlights
It’s end of the road for Pujara
Getting really tired of Kohli's constant failures. I'm glad Rahul has found some form.
What the heck rain 🌧did
King Kohli will come back
Even Anderson and the English  knew that what kohli  would do if he got set look at the way they all were running as if they have found something precious but they did got kohli who's a really big wkt
Mark my words this test will go as a draw
Virat kohli to jimmy I'll just bat😂 Jimmy just 1 ball😂
As a Pakistani I will support India team
Fun fact:Jimmy is 39 years old
3rd match kab hai
Match is pretty balanced,  although I think if India plays its cards well, they still have the slight advantage with KL, Pant, Shardul and Jadeja. If they all can chip in with an average of 30-50, that's another 200 odd runs.
Rahul got the timing 👌
virat is not able to adjust his natural style of batting ....
Kl rahul reminds me of vvs laxman...determined and focus.
Kohli bhai kya kar raha hai yrr....essa mat kr...you are a legend player bhai
Anderson swing bowling skills still alive 👆👆
Rishab pant century on day 3?
Best overseas player ever King Lohli scored just 100 runs short of his 100 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
What I see when I see Jimmy Anderson: 🍷
wha a great player Anderson. total professional and simple, Honest, no show-off  even now .
KPL is fantastic league but dont forget guys tea was so much fantastic shrup🤣🤣🤣🤣
Great to see Robinson back  He is a great prospects for England   and also  a better substitute  of Archer  who ruled out for almost an year . India have to watch out Robinson along with  Anderson he can be lethal as Jofra was in the recent  past against English  opposition. It will be  a sight to see the battle of Indians batters and English killer duo Anderson Broad  with newby  dangerous Robinson.
Great highlight. But this time why so late?
England wins max supported weather only.... In india pitches are support it natural..... But England atomsohere is support it's nature..... That's y the two important wicket fall down
Once upon a time ECB had a good editor
Grace and style...Both KL and Rohit and something about this England atmosphere that makes Test cricket so interesting..
The more matches India lose, more the chances of Rohit becoming a captain and winning major international trophies 😅
Pujaara is clueless in swinging conditions 😂😂😂😂 Flat track bulley he is. MOST SELFISH BATSMAN OF INDIA. I DONT KNOW HOW HE SCORED 8000 RUNS....SPITTING ON HIM.
still whole heartedly waiting for your 71st century .....
WoW 🤩 nice
8:00 look how quick Bairstow was in the field...really energetic And then got the run out wicket of Rahane
Kick out match fixer Rahane. He purposly gets run out. Idiot creature. When Rahane gets captaincy he plays for his SELF 100. Time to kick out this greedy chap.
💖💖My favourite test bowle Anderson 💖💖
Kohli is going through a bad luck 🙄🙄🙄
why kohli failed to perform after becoming a father?
First gold for india....golden duck be Virat kholi 😂🤣
*Legend will always be legend,Jimmy Anderson is really number one in Swing bowling and he proved this everyime.* *huge Love and respect to whole England team from india🇮🇳💕.*
Ind next test playing XI Rohit Rahul Virat  Sky H Vihari Pant R Ashwin ( first choice he has more experience in county)  S Thakur M Shami J Bumrah M Siraj / Arjan ( for variety) Pl Drop Pujara ( so rusty) and Rahane no intent from them. See Rahane run out just like walking in forest no dive at all. Kohli is also in danger no century fails in knockout matches if he can't bat properly what's the need of him.
Excellent batting Rahul and Rohit..
Woow dream magical spell from Jimmy hats off ❤️❤️❤️👍👍👍
1:30 that shot 🔥🔥
8:37 respect Boss jimmy
Editor - lets show a bunch of inconsequential singles and edit out the DRS reviews.
Average bowler in Away conditions
And also appreciate Jimmy Anderson.. The legend
Rahul and rishab india future🙏👉💪👍👍
Overcast condition bowler Anderson... Little bit of sunlight n he forgets d art of swing,, 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Great batting by kl Rahul.. What A class player.. England have no answers
9:35 Look at root 😅
Kholi missed His century by Just 100 Runs 😂😂😂
Kholi Tujsa Nhi Hoti Century 😂
kohli getting out on a duck still don't change the fact that he is the best batsman in the world. love from Pakistan
To all those kohli lover spammers  You are the only one who is increasing the hate towards kohli
9:14 That ball from Anderson to Kohli... Just Woww!!.. What a great bowler James Anderson is....
Pujara's Career is in danger........
kohli from last year is just playing to disturb his beautiful past records!!! And Jimmy you beauty❤️
Looking wonderful the competition between bat and ball when it's with Jimmy vs Classy KL
Great to see M S Dhoni commenting on Jimmy's performance today. I remember Dhoni's reaction when Ian Bell was stumped  at the end of a session, his sense of fair play was immense that day. Massive respect to Dhoni, and all the Indian fans on here who support test cricket. "Pyjama" cricket has its place, but test cricket is where its at, and will always be.
Dear editor , Please show the full DRS
Why only 47 overs?
Pant
Kl Rahul fans ❤️👍
Rohit bhau plays short ball so well, but time and again he does this. Instinct.
Jimmy vs Kohli:A untold love story
Umpires used "sasta Nasha"
Rohit in ODI : Double hundred is the goal Rohit in T20 : 50 or maybe century is the the goal Rohit in test : 30 runs is the goal. 😂   he is now feeling above 30 is like gift runs to him He is always the batsman that has gifted his wicket. He looked solid with his defence but ended up playing pull to fielder. From then the collapse
Full of attitide kohli..as usual when he gets out for a low score..looks at the pitch..rather than his technique..shud have been leaving that ball outside the 4th stump..  His technique to feel the ball early on when he comes..is easily exploited by opposition teams.. Need to self introspect and do less of weight training and more of net batting and seek expert advise from sachin or dravid  to correct out his flaws.. and to top it of..he is using an angled bat..just like pujara.. That explains his drought of centuries in all the format, especially tests.. as his flaws cannot be hidden due to close catching fielders... 👎👎👎👎👎👎
Very poor shot Rohit 😥
Why the crowd very happy on vk wicket no make sense 🤔past 2 years he's not produce his best performance when he came you know what happen
What a inning kl &what a spell jimmi Anderson
At the end of the test India will win
@ECB, please please hire some professional (who knows cricket as well) to make these highlights.
A strong start from India 🇮🇳 but that’s why they say it’s “TEST CRICKET”. Fantastic bowling by the ageless Jimmy Anderson and a slight bit of foolishness from the Indian batsmen .. particularly from Rahane and Pujara.. we Indians love the thrill, don’t we ? 🤣🤣 but this is Test Cricket 🏏 at its Very Best.
Great swing bowling by anderson
This will be a draw according to weather
Nalla kholi nalla pujara middle order khrab krdia dono ne
I love the way in which the crowd of England appreciates the opponents as well.. (2: 25) 💫💫..
How does Rahane gets himself run out in test matches. He got run out in Australia too when he was captain and scored 150. Why do you want to take such a close single.
One of the all time greats !Anderson always love to watch him bowl,the  i am westindian.
2019 kl with pant score  English side ,these player again 2021 in English ground.
Jimmy The 🐐
If nothing else good happens in this match, priceless seeing Kohli go first ball
Cricket is beautiful with english spectators ❤
Virat kohli ...😧😧😧 2011😂😂😂
Jimmy was all over india!!!!!!! I don't think they can survive tomorrow!
Rain rain and bad light that's England cricket  is all about
Don't take tension pant give punishment
Good to see Rahul in touch...Class Player ...treat to eyes...
Kohli is Overrated
Man Anderson is a beast.
Something didnt changed in england. e.g.- the way kohli get out 😂😂😂
England wast team
Pant looking full in mood attack
Anderson!!!!!! YOU BEAUTY!!!!!! Golden DUCK for Kohli
If pant battles  for one and helf sessions  India  will be in command
Jimmy Anderson you beauti greatest spell
may be pujara and virat need to watch videos of babar azam,,, virat is just a hype
Worst wicket was Rahane. What a silly way to get out in a Test match, even after surviving a close runout before. He deserves to be dropped, for his stupidity. He has been gifting his wicket away too many times recently
Jimmy ur still young man 🤨 kl class rahul😍
Real good deliveries to get Puji and Kohli. Can’t blame them you know. Hope they bounce back in the next 9 innings. We need them 💪🏻
I WILL JUST PLAY !! 😂
Pujara slip out 99% virat slip out 98% Anderson is great 😲😲😲 bowling, kl rahul 101 runs ,pant 74 runs 🙄🙄🙄  guess is beautiful
India ne tatti khaali apni
England play 65 over india 46 over ongoing end of day 2
England play 65 over india 46 over ongoing end of day 2
Anderson reverse swing soothing to the eye's 😍
Kholi  is not in good form
69 over loss in 2 day
Tomorrow either pant on🔥 Or England bowler on 🔥
Anderson might be a "vampire"... He never gets Old... He troubled Sachin in the Previous Era.. Now he is after Kohli..
When i start watching match Meanwhile me :- Still Anderson is playing and OMG . What a bowling ❤️. Bdw India will conquer 👍
vk cant bat get rid
kohli fucked upp! haha
INDIA WILL WIN INSHALLAH! ❤️
What happened to King Kohli?? 😅 Watch and learn from Rahul and Rohit, instead of hiding and come in number 4
Nowadays it's just joy to watch kohli out on 0
This crowd is freaking better than a T20 match.
Rahul looked Damn Confident. Though England would have taken more wickets but Rahul would have too scored more runs.
We can't blame rahane batting bcs we didn't got to watch his batting that's a other issue but I think pujaras batting is concern, bcs he is somewhat slippy in English conditions since wtc final against nz
Jimmy is the key factor of England bowling....
Kohli Kabhi Anderson nd swann ko khelna nhi seekhaa
9:15 Best part of the Day 2😍❤️
Old man Anderson 😅🤣🤣🤣😂
Jimmy Anderson is taking fitness lessons from Queen of England :P
I'm a huge fan of Virat's fitness but I think Anderson needs to be given some credit for the kind of physic he's been able to maintain at the age of what 38,39? Woahhh
Test match on a t20 ground amazingggg ICC
Virat is big scalp
Rahul Double Century laga de🙏🙏🙏🙏
It also give them a chance, as it is only first test , if those two batsmen didn't perform well my choice is introduce sky either in place of puji or rahane
That applaud from Ravi Shastri for KL Rahul
Same old story of Indian middle order, letting the game slip away if India lose this match after doing so well on the first day and the morning session of day2, some tough decision has to be taken..
Chill out its just not Virat's day. Its a long series Virat, Pujara and Rahane will definitely find a way to bat in these conditions because that's what great players do. We should be happy that even after a massive batting collapse we're in a good position.
9:15 😍😍💕💕🔥🔥🤣🤣
Kohli mudded. You love to see it 😂
The roar when kholi  got out. 😲
Jimmy A true Legend Playing At the Age of 39 And specially Test Really Wow Jimmy.. And Also Pure Inning From Kl Rahul Hope He convert into Hundred Tomorrow.. Respect From🇵🇰❤️
The roar when kholi got out shows how  his wicket  can change the whole game
James Anderson people pay to watch him live and he doesn’t disappoint at all probably he should continue for few years more saying that on batting side KL Rahul looked sublime touch with classy shots
I think picking up suryakumaryadav and prithvi shaw in place of ajinkya rahane and pujara may be a good option when it comes to form
Zero kohli.ab sirf nam pe he kam kus nahi
textbook shorts
No comments
Good Technique for Getting Rohit Sharma Out
Jimmy Anderson takes a bow. What an exceptional bowler even at 39 age. Absolute legend
Survival+counter attack tomorrow..first get to 187 then get useful lead..Rahul needs to hold one end while Pant jaddu shardul  an strike at the other..Match On..Eng batting will collapse again..Ind needs to bat well to win matches its as simple as that..
Virat I am Your big fan ..Hope that you Will perform well in 2nd inning ❤❤❤
There won't be any fast bowler who's going to take as many test wickets as Jimmy Anderson. Mark my comment for The generations to come.
Some one needs to remind ajinkya that he is playing a test
Rahane aur Pujara kuch jyada hi pressure me nahi khel rahe?
Yet another failure for Virat Kohli  Same happened in his first innings in 2014 . So will 2014 be repeated ?
Excellent batting by Rohit n rahul they looked different league ,Rahane ran himself out there was no run and also a over before he took risky single might be pressure otherwise a cool customer
excellent bouncer to dismiss elephant rohit and great bowling by anderson
Hey ECB ab hindi me highlight nahi daloge kya bro 😁
Jimmy u beauty..Love from India
4:41 Jethalal Gada?
Kohli should be dropped. There are other talented batsmen in Indian cricket team. Give them some chance. 2 years without a century is really poor performance.
Virat duck chocker kohli🦆🦆😜😜😜
It is tumultuous when kohli got out, everyone were exuberant, this was ostensible that how Kohli is lethal....
My fav jimmy
suuuper winning india
Jimmy Anderson even at 39🔥🔥Greatest of all time❤
9:15
Likke lelo pant 100 marega
That run out👻👻
They say age is just a number.. Here we have Jimmy Anderson 💪 🔥
More homework think end of the day team A or B
My friend: Indian fans Virat Kohli will score century today.    Me:absolutely not.
What a knock by KOHLI 😂
Wow Anderson vs Kohli😍❤️
Virat Kohli: ''I will like to bat''
Ahh ..just feel peace of eyes in every KL Rahul's shot 🖤🖤 Rohit was also better 🖤
what's with VK??...he is getting worse in every former of cricket
English soil and rain,, wc2019, WTC 2021 and now. Lets hope for good wether in coming days
As usually Kohli's bad form continues against Anderson
They r missing jofra archer
Christopher Henry Gayle= Greatest batsman of all time in the history of the game, has played against all the greatest bowlers of past, present generations, Ricky Ponting/Steve Waugh= Greatest Captains of all time in the history, Jacques Kallis/Yuvraj Singh/Shakib Al Hasan= Greatest all rounder in the history, Adam Gilchrist/MS DHONI = Greatest wicket keepers in the history, Jonty Rhodes/Ricky Ponting/Yuvraj Singh= Greatest fielders in the history, Shane Warne/Murlidharan= Greatest Spinners in the history, James Anderson/Wasim Akram/Glenn McGrath/Malcolm Marshall/Waqar Younis= Greatest fast bowlers in the history
Virat gone 0  Cheek the  face expression 😂😂😂
Kohli will definitely come back in this series. You can not stop legends too long.
This Jimmy looks good, he should be given a debut in ODI and T20 too...
Rahane please retire gracefully.
Jimmy Anderson will take kohli's  wicket atleast 5 times in this series.
Virat kohli 😂 hundred times same out rip
Swing bowling is treat to watch when it releases from that man's hand who is 39 now..Take a bow to his fitness..
Watch out for Pant tomorrow
Kohli pitch pa tatti kar ka gaya maza agaya England zindabad
Virat we r waiting for your knock since years 😓
Anderson is God of bowling..m from India bt he is what he is..bt kl Rahul is God of technic n big shots..
9:14 what you're here for...
Virat needs to step down from captaincy. non consistent and always a failure in finals.
1080p or 4k quality highlights would have been better
KL Rahul is Modern Age Dravid...Guy with a Good defense mechanism nd variety of shots...Well played
Kohli has only ego left in him :(
Indians are only good at home pitches  Little bit reverse swing and they are exposed 😂  Home lions for a reason
Kohli's days seem to be over.
Rahul and pant are last hope.
Ohh poor rahane.....
Virat these days is only doing promotion on his Instagram handle got out on first ball. Virat fans don't attack me no doubt he is a good player but nowadays his performance is not good.
Good game 👏
The ball to Virat Kohli swung in and seamed out. Jimmy Anderson the absolute legend 🐐 Edit: The swing forced the drive. The seam got the edge !
Imagine Archer was playing India would have been all out by now !
It was a Great delivery to Kohli...Jimmy Anderson u beauty...
Kl rahul also best my fav
Very disappointment Virat Kohli innings 💔 Anderson bowling very beautiful ❤️👍
Divided by borders, united by batting collapses😛 Good luck for tomorrow, hoping for a ton from Rahul and a 5-fer for Anderson. Love from 🇵🇰
Feeling sad for kohli he missed century by 100 runs
One thing is proved Tendulkar was best than kholi because kholi whenever faces top bowling on difficult pitches he struggles while Tendulkar was master always
9:18 the crowd shows how kohli’s wicket is more important for 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿  Well bowl enderson
කෝලි අද නිදාගන්නෙ නැ ☹️
My hero anderson jimmy we all love u but bad luck for kohli both of players good luck for next inngs
This is the last series for useless pujara
Rahul clasyy 🔥
1:11 🧡✌️
Two wickets were gifted to England. One was Rohit and 2nd was rahane. What was rohit thinking??
Jimmy Anderson hasn't aged at all. LEGENDD!!
Opening n dil khush kr dya kasam s
Kholi technique is vulnerable in England, he struggles most of the time when ball did a lit bit
Kohli's performance is getting off while he is aging 😂😂
Esko ab anushka sharma ke sath movie krni chahiye  Sala farzi me cricket khel rha h
What happened to the art of shouldering arms? 🙄
Kohli miss his century by 100 runs😂😂😂
Come on King Kohli 👑 what are you doing man 😭🤦🤦
Kohli must be dropped as he has not been scoring for the last 2 years
*_The people who disliked this amazing highlights need a covid test, because they have no taste._*
Be a positive sports man
Abe T20 na hai ye kl rahul jessa time leke khelo 🙄
You always have a big mouth holding against india in England
Excellent shot holding
Rain saved india from james Anderson he would have demolished and annihilated Indian batting lineup if rain hadn't spoiled the game
Rohith Sharma is HITMAN only in Indian pitches,  we are pressurizing our middle order batsmen by including him.. shubman should be playing with Rahul..
Pujara bohot dino se without form
Virat is out of form for too long now we know he is best when inform but is worst currently should give chance to other batsman and return when he is in form
Rohit sharma played unwanted shot
There is Jimmy Anderson. Then the daylight. Then the rest. This man is made of a different mettle.
*Man look at Jimmy swinging seaming the ball  at the age of 39 and shocked Kohli like he did in 2014*
Kohli is so overrated
Virat Kohli goldan dake
DRS dikhane pe copyright lag jaata hai kya? (-_-)
O Jimmy jimmy jimmy uff Anderson on 🔥🔥🔥🔥 outstanding cone back❤️
Once again 2nd , 3rd , 4th collapse 🙄
Being an Indian it feels funny & frustrating at the same time when Indian middle order gets exposed in just a matter of 30 mins, Rohit not learning from his early mistakes in aus,England's India tour.  I mean everytime he battles so hard to get pass those first 30 overs & then he throws his wicket for free Pujara have only one job, just to stay there & save the wicket,team's not asking him to score runs, if he can't do his one job, then there are many cricketers who are interested to be no. 3 & rahane,every time some quick wickets he tries aggressive cricket Eventually leads to giving away his wicket, there was no run there
Kohli k sath bohhot burra huwa yaar.🤭🤭🤭
Virendra Sehwag said, Kohli got a Golden DucK
K.L RAHUL=SHADOW OF RAHUL DRAVID
KL is batting like Rahul Dravid
Virat is an excellent hardworking person who do his home work  perfectly. So dont be happy he will surly be coming back in next inning.
James Anderson........ 💖😍🙌
jimmy shut up the mouth of over confident kohli 🤔❤️
Kholi lol
The patience of watching cricket in England are crazy,
Bumrah out Anderson   thats like copy paste
What will England do without Anderson
Don’t upload singles
Virat Kohli loojar player 😀
Virat's caught behind on the Anderson ball is the old age thing, I don't know what has happened with him, I hope he comes back soon!
Bad luck kohli
2022 is last series for Anderson 😭 G.O.A.T
Kohli got a real ripper from Anderson first up... Don't think he should be criticized so much...even the best player in the world can have a bad day sometimes... Respect from Pakistan
Messi leaves Barcelona 💔
Thw Way They Guys Celebrating Kohli's wickets is shows that if he get set there then he will going to distroy there bowling lineup
മലയാളികൾ ആരും ഇല്ലഡെ... 🔥👍
Kohli is so great that sometimes kohli can't be kohli sometimes 😁
Half highlights are annoying, boring….  Things start happening after Rohit Sharma Out..  I love when English crowd yells “yeahhhhhhh”
39 yet as  good as 19 ....
Anderson ❤️💥💖
Aj mne 2.5 km cycle chalai aur thk gya,, age 28,,aur jimmy ko dekho yr.
Jimmy 🔥🔥🔥
Run machine we are waiting for your 100
Bowlers are great. It's just our batting lineups lost their consistency......
Bhivi would have been better than Anderson, had he not lost his pace
Can't believe jimmy is 39 year old😵 Absolute Legend ❣️
Pujara needs to work on his trigger movement. It’s barely a shuffle, leaving him inside the line of balls that pitch on or around off
Anderson u beauty
Jimmy andreson what a bowler mystery bowler great comeback by england india top order really perform well especially K L rahul middle order collapse i think that's the time india looks to captaincy changes virat kohli performance down
What was rahane trying to do still he was lucky that he didn't get out on the first instance then he didn't utilize the luck given to him to throw his wicket unnecessarily.
Why does Virat Kohli seem to struggle far more against England, than he does against other teams? Doesn't make sense.
Where was the ball tracking?
Excellent by Jimmy and Rahul 👍
When I was a kid my favourite bowler was Anderson , today I am married with one kid and his favourite bowler is also Anderson.
A blinked and missed kohli 's innings 😁😁
Watching becos of Jamie. A gentleman for gentlemen game. I never seen such a great opening partnership in England by our champ.I saw a drunk man in pavilion
1:32 1:39 , that sounds like fatta hua bat
Virat kohli and pujara. Both can't score 50+ runs in an innings. They just can't play jimmy Anderson. If virat weren't not the captain then he must be out of the team.
Kholi ko anderson ko kabi khelna nhi aya ...aur na hi mohd amir ko ... fudu bowlers ko hi marta hai
Lol player virat
Rahane run out in test cricket for the first time
Anderson at his best Love from India🇮🇳
Start showing the reason why the decisions were overturned or stayed the same
Feeling sorry for Kohli, I wanted him to bat for a longer and hit a ton after the pandemic, but that's just things go on. Goodluck next time.
9:15 virat out for a golden duck😂
Kohli afraid of Rahane test captaincy
Kohli never gonna score hundred till he retires.. Mark it.
Time is running out for Pujara and rahane
Anderson Smashed Kholi Many Times!
Excellent RAHUL He is a second Rahul Dravid Gorgious inning by rahul
Pujara, Kohli, Rahane. They are supposed to be the backbone, the workhorses of this batting line up. All the rest are doing ALL the work for them. It's been a long time since any of these three fired.
the way he was fucking celebrating he knows very well who at his front the great batsman 🔥❤️
Damn ECB. You're milking the revenue from ads but changing the format of highlights from what you were earlier known for.
Pujaras career is done he has to retire.
The country England most happiest moment when king kholi  gose 😲😛
I'm not a fan of England. I just hate ind cricket 😂
We can't expect century by  kohli from last 1 year performance I think babar azam is best in this class.
Pujara the game changer for England....came to bat and handed the momentum completely to England
lucky to india there are no jofra,woakes,stokes😂😂
Kohli 😂 Indian Fans Faces 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Stay tune... India will come back stronger 🇮🇳😊
Kl rahul in touch!!
😎Jimmy anderson 😎 he is the legend GOAT 😈
Waiting for Rahul's century celebration 🥳
9:16 I am not crying 😭😭😭😭😭
Virat not in form but still virat wicket whole team and stadium joy that's the power of king Kohli form is temporary class is permanent ❤️🇮🇳👍
Now a days Virat kohli going to be a hero to zero...he must be give up his Captaincy to Rahane otherwise India never win a series
KL is so calm and composed 🔥
Can't believe KL was dropped from the team, especially in the crucial WTC!
Kohli 🤣🤣🤣🤣  💩
Hahaha kholi ist pay out maza ahgya
KL Rahul Indian wall  of England
India is favorite to win this test but rain is the wall in front of India's victory 😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔
I think kohli era comes to end
Anderswinger iz simply Legend..
Great batting DUCKROLI 😂😂
The editor is clearly a batsman. Four replays of a cover drive but not a second look at an LBW shout, one that gets reviewed no less. The England team asks for another look but our editor has seen enough
It was a treat to watch kl rahul bat.. KLaasy Rahul..  Excelleny bowling by jimmy.
The new team Without virat is looking solid in test cricket
Jimmy😍
Jimmy anderson = 500 test wickets Still look like a youngster. Amazing maintainence of body.
I could watch this shot all day 6:46
Lame af edit 👎🏻👎🏻
Now every team knows that Rohit weakness is short ball pullshot 😂 Test is se nahi hoga bhai 😂
This story is not ending that pujara got out on best balls of match ,,😂
If Mayank is available in the next test, Kohli should drop himself.. Disgusting player..
KL rahul is best batsman in our world indian team captain is not a virat indian cricket team captain is kL rahul
What happened to kohli 😭🙄
May our parents live more than 100 years with good health and prosperity!! Ameen! ❤️❤️❤️
Good Opening by Rohit and Rahul 😊
Shouldn't have extended the highlights for soo long for such a short period of gameplay, views ECB hmmmmmm
India will be win this match.
Anderson = Class    But may god bless india for this test win and series win 🇮🇳
KL Rahul shows why he deserves to be an opener.such a class act he is
KL and his best😍
Sir Jimmy GOAT 👍
Thanks for highlights it's like one day match good crowd in England
Rahul was calm as ice today great temprament. Hope Kohli comes back with a classy knock
pujara at it yet again ... just needs to be kicked off from the team ....
Abey England waalo Bijli ka bill bharo saalo tumhare stadium se jayada light toh hamare gaav me hoti hai l@ude
Worst highlights, please learn something from cricket SRILANKA 🙏🙏
Virat ,rahane,pujara as usall shows poor batting
Still India ahead at this stage..Kohli must take a break & play some domestic cricket. ...
Where are chris woakes and mark wood?
Just xclant sound bad
Great piece of class & swing shown by world's greatest bowler Jimmy Anderson...... ❤️ The real GOAT ❤️❤️❤️
It takes just one ball to get out any batsman. It doesn't matter even if you are Virat Kolhi. Summing up Virat Kolhi is worth. 1 ball faced 0 runs. Test cricket is test cricket. Endorsements and money can't make you face the second ball. Soodu...sorana iruntha intra message puriyum... Valga Tamil...
Is broad going bald?
Pujara,Kohli,Rahane have to change batting style.n learn to control game
Pujara kohli n rahane were the culprits of world cup also
KL Rahul is just astonishing he should have had more chances in the past but NVM now atleast he should get enough chances to prove himself. He is a gem.
Till 97 i was in bit disbelief but then after quick downfall i laughed.....yes that's d India we all know, there it is!! Bloody pack of cards. Pant will swing d bat knowing he can't fkn survive there defending. Hope he survives 10ovs swinging bat, atlst wud give us 200+. The situation India were in, 300 shd be minimum they shd be looking at and with Ashwin sitting, only 350 will be justified with bulking up the batting n all!
Peak anderson moment
kuch bhi hojaye, India will win. 125-150 lead tomorrow and it is game over. Rishabh kal 100 maarega.
Rahane's run out seemed fishy.... For some reason, I have been doubting this guy since a few years now!
Anderson is the best bowler in his generation. He should have played ODI cuz he is still playing like a 25 yrs old player. Will miss him when he retires
Disappointed with rahane to throw his wicket like this
where is chris woaks if stokes is not available that guy is pure match winner both with bat and ball
"Reaction of England squad" after getting 'Kohli's' wicket😅😅
And there is people who compares Kohli with Sachin.... Or even put Kohli above Sachin.... But reality is, like in this match, Kohli is a golden duck, 🦆🦆🦆
Whatever Anderson did, match is over for England.
9:15 You All Came For
Really want to see old hungry virat Kohli , Wish you to have a great comeback )
Why virat going to play that ball it's first ball man 🤔😐
Don't worry England "India" will come back stronger ...just wait and watch.
Kholi sirf fukra bnti ke kam hi rh gya hai ab
Subse pehle Rahane ko permanent nikalo bahar or SuryaKumar ko lao.....pujara ke jagha prithvi shaw ko.....pujara test specialist mane jate hai...but kya faida ? Kohli not performing well in England but still No.1 for me
Just a 60 to 70 runs lead is enough and it’s Good Bye England see ya in the next match with India leading the series 1-0
Anderson vs  Kohli 🔥 What a great player Anderson is
Jimmy Anderson is best bowler in the world in a fast bowler
Literally who would have thought Jimmy Anderson one day would equal Kumble's Record....Take a Bow Master of Fitness
How can you not show ball tracking for the reviews come onnnn
During my school days I saw Jimmy Anderson. Bowling now I am a dad to my 2 year old son and still seeing him taking wickets..wow !
@10:54.. Topical Pant! 4th ball and he's already down the track... I love it🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Kl rahul looking very solid and confident while batting... His foot work looking great i wish he scored big hundred tomorrow If india wants a driver seat in this match then we need minimum 100 runs lead😁
Kholi Tum Jesa Koi Nhi, Tum 0 Prr Out Hokar Bhi Legend Ho Boss, No 1 Player Of The World Virat Kholi, Love From Pakistan
Where Archer?
Most overrated overhyped player in the world virat kholi👎
Something will never change for Indian team that is middle order collapse in seaming and bouncy condition...worst performance...😡😠
first times bowl (57 over) bowl wasn't good! kamruzzaman, hi
1:11 Shot of the Day 2 of the 1st Test Match!
Kl rahul calm and composure
Anderson once again took his bunny 🐰_ Mr virat kohli.
Virat said he will keep playing Anderson but did not mention just for the 1 ball on which he will get out! For the first time in a while our middle order is looking fragile with 3 of Kohli, Pujara n Rahane looking like throwing away their wickets cheaply! Now it depends on the openers n our lower order to score substantial amount of runs for us, given the lack of form of our experienced 3! Cheers to Rahul for making a superb return to Test cricket, keeping our hopes high! Tomorrow gonna be crucial, with a few hits from Pant we will go past the English total, taking a valuable first innings lead!
When ball swings kohli says I can't bat.
There is something about Rahul n English conditions.. brings the best out of them.. 😌
Big fan of anderson swing bowling, jus beauty, so kohli duck is kind of mixed feelings
Old Wine. New Bottle. Lucky to see the legend of the game in action
Great jimy the swing king . Kohli lalu lal
Pujara should be replaced. He only tries to defend.
Always great to see Anderson- virat encounter, this time jimmy wins. People who question jimmys record abroad, well most of them weren’t born here.wn he first started playing. He demolished celebrated Indian line up in 2006 Bangalore test, he also had greater success in NZ and South Africa. The only place he has struggled is Down under ( Australia 🇦🇺 most uneducated Indian trolls aren’t aware of it). Moreover Jimmy is 39, and name any other bowler who is as force as him. Zaheer and srinath retired from the game by the age of 35! Indians should stop 🛑 counting the chickens 🐓 b4 they hatch, this game is on...
Rahul proved why he is classy batmen 👌👌👌
I loved test Cricket 🏏😍
কোহলি ব্যাটিং মনযোগী হবার দরকার।গত ২ বছর খুভ বাজে খেলছে
Anderson: The Magician
Great come back  Legend Anderson 🚩
Just look at the crowd after kohli's wicket
England are back at 9:10 jimy ❤️
India finally got gold with kohli not in olympics
Rahul played beautifully , silly short from Rohit Sharma laps his concentration , virat    Need to work his mental health must more polite calming on field avoid unnecessary aggression lead into drain his energy instead he should calmingly focus on scoring runs resume his batting form he must learn politeness kindness from sachin tendulkar  who could silent killer for England's 6 foot fast pace bowlers .. india team must have positive attitude must enjoy the challenge over their mental Obstacle ..
9:13 what a Delivery By Anderson ❤️
i wish india win the series
Kohli🤣🤣🤣
Kl rahul 🔥🔥
Rahul outlasts four of his teammates. A testament to both him and Anderson.
Virat sadi ke baad kuchh khel hi nehi pa raha he...
VADA PAV ROHIT 36 runs and stayed for 100+ balls  VIRAT FITNESS KOHLI OUT FIRST BALL  C PUJARA EASY CAUGHT OUT A RAHANE STUPID RUNNING  FINEST 3-4-5 number batsman, they say
Virat kohli is an overrated batsman.. I have not seen any big player who have been out of form since two years. His avg in last two years in test is 30.13. He is taking everything for granted now. After wtc loss they should have play more practice matches but they choose holiday with family.. After holiday they played one county game even there our great batsman didn't play.. He think he is bigger than sport so bhai game s koi bda nh.. Hmre country k team h tumri rcb nh k bina kuch kiye khele jao.. Aur vo log plz mjhe comment na kre jo team s phle kohli ko priority d.. Kitna aur kab tak support kre jb banda mehnat krne ko ready nh apne aap sh nh hoga sb.
duck master king .......?
-_- Jimmy Anderson the G.O.A.T 🐐 -_-
Indian teams dress looks brighter than the England's.. Is it a ujjala effect? 😂
Kholi what you did yar💔 Now will wait for 2nd inngs. Fan from 🇵🇰
The crowd's roar at 9:16 tells everything. The importance of Kohli's wicket that too taken by Anderson. So nice to see and hear the real crowd again 🎉🎈🎊🎉

WHAT HAPPPEND TO THERE BATTING LINE AGAINST PAKISTAN FOUR SIXES DOUBLES TRIPPLES AGAINT INDIA LOSING WICKETS IS THAT SAME ENGLAND TEAM FEW WEEKS AGO MONEY IS GOD FOR ENGLAND THANK GOD THIS GAMR IS NO LONGER GENTLE MAN GAME AT ALL
Kholi 😂😂
Jimmy Anderson a true legend
In India people are waiting for covid 3rd wave, & in England people are enjoying cricket match with full of audience😖
Very powerful batting line of India
Kohli has 3 ducks in last 6 innings
Anderson's celebration after getting kohli's wicket was wild
Rahane  ko kaha ki jaldi thi
6:45 P.M King kohli is coming After 15 Second King Kohli is going back to pavelion on a GOLDEN DUCK😁😁😁😂
Endia loss Insha Allah!
All time fvt... Anderson ❤️....
Andy is besti
Good luck
My name is james ..james Anderson..great legend ..one of all time great fast bowler in test matches history ..
I think India should try hanuma vihari or SKY instead of pujara
anderson kohli ka dusra baap ha kohli ki har waqt bajata rehta ha
Kholi scors no run i was like 😭😭😭😭😭
10:56 Brute Force 🔥🔥
Take a bow. Jimmy
The great wall Pujara and full pant  athletic Kohli 💩again ...
Kholi= class .. Form is temporary class is permanent .. Remember my words these people will praise him in his upcoming centuries
Orr hamare chokli bhya 1 sec me ground se bahar hote hua😂🤣🤣
13 duck Test 13 duck odi and 3 Duck of T20  virat kohli king for a reason Hahahahhaaha🤣🤣
Kohali has been finished after his  marriage.
Send Kohli, Rahane and Pujara home. They are good for nothing for the last 2 years. I think they are going to be a big flop in the whole series. 😢
How conveniently India have squandered such a fine start. Anderson as always, excellent
Mind blowing skill james anderson  😍😍 the best fast bowler all time in cricket history 😘😘😘😍😍😍✌
ENG AUS NZ crowds still loves test cricket because they knew that test cricket is a test of bowler batsman and fielder also 🙏🙏🙏🙏
I am very disappointed of the dismissal of rohit with that shot because I know that pujara and kohli are out of form. Kohli should definitely come back but I have no hope in pujara
KOHLI THE CHOKER
Editor needs to be fired
duckoli 🤣🤣🤣🤣 in England loli is always failed now he should against zimbabwe for his century
I am indian & big fan of anderson😍🔥
What happened to the Hindi highlights video
If pant remains not out till next day first session then india will take 50+ lead for sure as he plays agressive cricket, no matter who the bowler is😊
Again don't understand why Rohit sharma needed to play that kind of stroke ,that too when there were just 3 minutes left for lunch. Hard to digest because at that point of time india were cruising. Anyways he batted well. Hopefully he learns to bat on and get three figures as the series progresses. Have to feel for pujara and kohli as the line of attack was impeccable from anderson. India have to play sensibly now to get sizeable lead.
No hate to Pujara and Rahane But, I think it's time to think beyond these two players.... I feel they are only here bcoz of there names... That's not fair to other talented players in the country... Now a days Pujara and Rahane always disappointing us in critical times
Well  played kl rahul 🙏
Pujara and Kohli. Nothing to say. Idk what's wrong with Rahane. Rohit needs to realize that once he set no need to play shot like this. Number 3 and 4 are useless for india now. Again kohli is not playing with straight bat. When u are in not good touch u should play with straight bat. Remember Sachin's 200 without a single cover drive. What is a sign of great batsman? A great batsman quick realises his weakness. Kohli always struggles against swing. Plays cross bat and gets edges towards sleeps and keeper.
Don't change the position of KL rahul. I think shubman gill is the future no:3 batsman
KL Rahul always best.
Jimmy the legend ❤️
Kamaal Lajawab Rahul🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟
👍👌👏✌💪🌹🌷🌹👍👌👏✌💪💪
Kohli is now eyeing retirement. May be too aged, on other terms Anderson is going younger
Firstly just a word of advice/caution to the cricket loving fans there are certain fake accounts floating around of India haters report them straightaway, as they are sparking fights by pawning Rohit Sharma's and virat kohli or any other indian cricketer's name using dumb namecalling of either of indian cricketer and praising the other indian cricketer just to spark fights between indians making false claims and rubbish records Now for the video feedback, Typical English commentary buttered by unsurprising Michael hilding, bickering butthurt blokes attributing indian play more to edges and mistiming inspite of properly timed shots, positive and patient batting by indian openers, it's nothing unsurprising though, they just can't do any better, owing to their habitual and instinctive self 😀
Pujarah and rahane digging their own grave may not see them next in team. Both play with fear were my place in team may go 🤬🤬
Very disappointed with kohli and pujara. India should definetely replace pujara and find a new no:3 player
Pujara is playing test and scoring like t20
It just give a heart warming feeling when you see Kohli getting out by Anderson ✌🏻
What a beautiful batting has Rahul done? If India don't give wickets tomorrow morning and take a 60-runs lead then India On a Top
Virat 💔🥺 can't see you like that
Kohli should learn from Babar Azam 🇵🇰
Mujhe sabse jyada khushi hui jab Kohli first ball p out hua 🤣🤣🤣
Haha no one is talking about Indian opening stands lol. Everywhere I see is Jimmy Jimmy. What a biased people here. Good came back from England but India just needed 58 more runs. Rahul and Pant there at the crease and followed by sir Jadeja and shardul.
Anderson was amazing as usual. Rahul showed his class. Kohli is losing his touch. He is in the team based on his past performances. Last couple of years he has been a horrendous batsman. His technique shocks me
Anderson again out kholi
Normal players: it's difficult the bowl is swinging inside/outside Rohit: vo me pull krne gya tha :)
Rishabh pant is coming dude
Jimmy Cloudaration 🤣🤣😆😆
All of you who started praising Anderson Don't forget that Bumrah Shami and Shardul will be better than him in this match After 40 overs, there was a overcast condition, so the swing started, so Anderson got the wickets
Are they adding any sound effects for the bat and ball sound ?
Messi is leaving barca 😭😭🐐
Hitman Rohit🔥❤
It's very important for India that old😁 Rahul and  bumrah is come back position 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥👍👍👍👍
Ads bahut aata ha Iss par
Innings like these on English soil are what define kl rahul's calibre.... Far better than other new opening Batsmen in India🇮🇳
Common Jimmy don't retire for the next 5 years . Matches like these is what keeps true cricket fans still attached to the game.
No Woakes, No Wood, No Archer & No Stokes. Still they are struggling!!
Test cricket is the reason cricket is not globalized..... Stop test cricket
This is going to be a ripper of a series
India is America now at cricket Meanwhile, India at Olympics :- ~_~
Perfect Disaster after the Perfect Start😣😔
RUN OUT IN TEST MATCHES IS EQUAL TO A CRIME WITH NON BAILABLE WARRANT
❤️❤️
KL Rahul played like a gem of cricket.Great shots.
kohli :)
Great  bowling  Anderson
Just see the difference between two days highlights headlines!!! 125/4 is comeback for them but 183/10 got only a lazy headlines like 'England bowled out for 183' !!!
King beta ab pitch dekhta rayga out hone ke bd 😂😂😂😂
Rohit 36 out  Vs Australia 36/10  Reminds me 🤣🤣
Kohli needs to retire from Test cricket.🙏 To save his reputation
Olly Stone should be kept in 11 instead of Broad
Virat Kohli's great cricketing journey is over. He is almost near to retirement or to be expelled from the team.
*MESSI LEAVES BARCA*
Yesterday ecb got heart attack they uploaded so late today they were at lightning speed 😅
rahane's out is so funny in modern day cricket
Mission 100 for kohli☹️
Anyone hear Messi is not anymore in barcelona🙂
This eng side is not strong...india can easily win the series
Virat kohli.... Please bhai... disappoint mat kar ..
Pujara keeps getting out in the same fashion ,now every bowler knows 4th and 5th wicket line is his weakness  This idiot is not learning from his mistake at all
Kohli😂😂😂😂😂
Anderson deserves the wickets🥰🥰
That poking tendency of Kohli outside the offstump has been his biggest weakness!
This is a english channel, but though most of the viewers are from india.
GOAT 🐐🐐🐐 Jimmy
Hoping India will win ❤️
Team England don't forget team india in under pressure they bounce back... Coz RISHAB PANT here... fears less batsman ☔❣️☔❣️☔❣️💪💪💪
Jimmy--the mind blowing bowler❤
Rahane no. 3 vihari get no. 4 not pujara
Pujara is not fit for English condition. I mean he just plays test and also playing county in England, and still he struggles. Come on man. Replace him with sky or karun Nayar
HE PROFFS THAT, Age is just a number
Kids were waiting for Jimmy vs kohli Legends were waiting for Jimmy vs Pant
Kohli is over now 😢
Kohli and pujara dismissal is due to Anderson's brilliant bowling. I can accept.  But Rahane and Rohit gave their wicket very easily...
Pujara Kholi game over 😂
Audience seems like india's independence old😝
Why Rohit always  throws his wicket?? He's gone so many times by playing that hook shot and he keeps on doin it..he doesn't even realize that bowlers are challenging him by giving room to play that shot and get caught.... He started off so well calm n composed.. But again that one shot which he always play has cost him
Don’t worry king kohli we are with you. He got dismissed on ball of the century if vadapav would have thier he would have got dismissed very badly king you played well and roshit was struggling on every delivery 😂 vadapav for a reason😂
Don’t worry king kohli we are with you. He got dismissed on ball of the century if vadapav would have thier he would have got dismissed very badly king you played well and roshit was struggling on every delivery 😂 vadapav for a reason😂
🇬🇧 will not lose this match from here As Only 2 Results can be  ☝️ 🇬🇧 Win (🇮🇳 Lose) ✌️ Draw More Tough time for 🇮🇳 to bat in 4th Innings
Don’t worry king kohli we are with you. He got dismissed on ball of the century if vadapav would have thier he would have got dismissed very badly king you played well and roshit was struggling on every delivery 😂 vadapav for a reason😂
only rohit sharma can take his wicket
KL Rahul. what a class
KING ON 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Dislike are kolhi paid followers
Everyone- Rain Stops Jimmy's rhythm Me-Rain Stops Pant onslaught 😃😃😃
Virat should have taken retired form captain
Really the class ,agrression and brilliance.that,s James Anderson.
KL Rahul looked in a different touch than the last time he played England...i hope he keeps up the form.
Rohit has got everything as a batsman yet always failed to convert 30s ,40s to big scores
James Anderson = Anil Kumble. Jimmy = Jumbo 619★ = 619
Kholi  pujara say runs nai bansaktay
Good Anderson
Kab tak pujara human vihari kyu nhi
KL is focused. Not easy. Pujara must be out. Kohli also. FOcus focus focus focus focus focus focus
Cr7 36 & Jimmy 39🔥
VK again disgusting batting performance.. Even he had forget when was the last time he got an international century.. its been two fucking years.. he should step down from captaincy
What's up with Virat?? 😭😭
Where is stokes?
Run out ho rhe h
wonderfull bowlling pitch?
In all battles between Anderson and Kohli, Anderson won almost all the time, that shows his class  👍
Who loves India’s cricket like here
ANDERSON ON FIRE    ✨️ ❤
One n only KL Rahul is the positive sign for India today
ECB highlights quality has deteriorated significantly! No dropped catches, no DRS instead showing singles and dot balls.
Kohli to ab bs style marne ke liye reh gya h ab kuch nhi hota usse
We need ms dhony like test players
Pujara, Kohli, and Rahane are just eating places for others. Vihari, SKY, and Easwaran should get a go.
It was not gorgeous delivery only thing pujara has to play and it could be boundry
Koliiiii golden duck 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂. Thank you Anderson
Kohli and Pujara struggling again in test matches.. making that top order struggle.. don’t know what has happened to kohli..
9:15 best moment of my life our lad
When Kohli is out crowd were Happy Because The Know Who is Kohli and What he will do !
kholi goes to meet his wife early...
Woah i saw a punjabi guy with indian flag so all punjabi people and punjabi foreign living guys aren't anti-indian i thought most punjabis are anti indian and pro pakistani type people even tho they live and eat in indian soil...that's new he's sure a good man likes of bhagat singh ig
Great display of batting by KL under such pressure. Hope he gets a 3 digit score. He deserves it
Well Played KL😍👏
india win
I had thought Broad and Anderson had retired
Sam Curran looks like Jack Frost from Rise of the Guardians
So sad to see that more than 90% people in comment section are talking(insulting) about kohli.   Rahul ke baare me bhi kuch baat karo. What a comeback by that guy. Wonderful innings
kohli wants to defence , took edge passed to keeper : dramatic play ever by kohli : never saw kohli in such low confidence, KOHLI STRUGGLING  FROM NZ SERIES ? THOSE 2 tests in nz are  god smacken hell tests which costed  kohli with  low scores : jamieson created doubts in the mind of kohli
King💔
Jimmy Anderson is like an old wine in a new bottle. Genuine talent
Kl Rahul. What a class.
Virat kohli 0 😂😂
Virat: I'll just bat...
2:18 Rahul 100 marke ise chup kra dena😋 klass Rahul 🏏😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
OMG ab ki baar Jennings ya malan nai the catches drop karne?? Oh this tym it was buttler so Jimmy got virat again
Rahane and Pujara must be immediately kicked out..rubbish
Anderson's haters on the way to call him Home track bully.
Laugh if u have 200 in test King kohli😂 kl rahul😂 Karun nair😂 dhobi and vadapav😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Laugh if u have 200 in test King kohli😂 kl rahul😂 Karun nair😂 dhobi and vadapav😭😭😭😭😭😭😭

India should not back pujara and rahane much there are players like Hanuman vihari and many more on the bench.
Laugh if u have 200 in test King kohli😂 kl rahul😂 Karun nair😂 dhobi and vadapav😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
King kohli will bounce back soon....
Ind should drop chetrshwar and Rahane for next game
Laugh if u have 200 in test King kohli😂 kl rahul😂 Karun nair😂 dhobi and vadapav😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Kohli should retire atleast from test cricket there are many youngsters waiting who can easily score much more than kohli he is anderson's bunny in 2018 also many catches were dropped
Still Virat Kohli Fan???😢 Like👍
King kohli will bounce back soon..
KL you beauty! Classical shots and Jimmy you're still young....being a cricket fan very much happy to see such an extraordinary test match! Who cares about result..🤣
Pujara aur Kohli ke jagah Sky aur Vihari ko chance dena chahiye dono milaakar 50 runs ban jaate atleast 🤣
Classic show by Indian player 👌 Rohit's pull shot miscalculated and Jinks run out 🙄
King kohli will bounce back soon...who are agree like and comment.....
Kohli face OMG 😂
Please don't lose heart from VIRAT KOHLI...As we also surprised to see VIRAT KOHLI got out on a duck.....
???????????????????
Okka match aiena Aadu ra Kohli neeku dandam peduthanu.

Rohit-Rahul in ODI'S Rohit-Rahul in T20'S Rohit-Rahul in Test's          ❤
Who watched kohli's dismissal more than once👇
Rainy Day as always in England!
King kohli will bounce back soon... Who are agree comment and like....
Anderson .. pha .. what a bowler... Excited to see Virat vs Anderson
I love watching KL Rahul in full flow. I hope he gets a century tomorrow so that he can finally seal his place in all three formats.
When last time Virat Kohli out on Duck in the Start of the Series' First Innings:-  •In 2017 vs SL - 0 then 104*, 213, 243, 50 •In 2019 vs BAN - 0, then 136
Well edited but what's the fun of hiding England's uncsucessful review and India's successful one...
"KL"ASS
Still this channel has to learn how to edit for highlights!!! 2 review taken but nothing shown !!! Whether a boundary shot is seen for 4/5 times in highlights!!!  Poor editing
Anderson had Imran Tahir in him after Kohli's wicket. Not even after Mitchell Johnson sledge did Anderson celebrate like this
Kholi..and..Pujara what a shame 🤬🤬🤬
James Anderson You Beauty......... ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Clouds back Anderson back.. Clouderson
Well played Lokesh Rahul
It's high time to drop Pujara Who hasn't scored a century for so long , about 30 months...Give a chance to SKY in place of him
What a stare of kohli on the pitch after getting out! 9:40   And the patience check of Rohit Sharma .  7:18 Two dramatic things we have seen many times.
King Kohli 0🤣
Rohit-man  again throws his wicket 😫😫
Wat a poor shot from d cap
Rahul bhai is wonderful play
There are a lot of 2s in the title😂
don't forget about pant...
Jimmy y not in odi cricket
King kohli will bounce back....
Don't forget kl he is the one who hold India together like for him
*Excellent opening batting form Rohit and rahul, this is the highest opening partnership in overseas  tests for india in ten years, hoping for Rahul'd century tomorrow* 🇮🇳🇮🇳
The impact of virat kohli wicket could be heard by the crowd
Aajkal Kohli century se 100 runs piche reh jaate hai 🤣🤣
Anything to say for rohit sharma?? he just thrown his wicket... If any bowler need hardly wicket then rohit comes in and gives 😭Being rohit sharma fan is not easy 😖
Anderson is a class act.. Very Bad time going for VK as usual aged player now but he will rise before retiring for sure
Anderson goat what a bowler je is the goat in tests don't forget his age
Duckohli
Everyone keep all your mouth shut because he is only 39 not 78 as all your points.. All your comments are so pathetic 🙄..Be independent in every views and thoughts..don't follow others footsteps...
2014 returns
Rahul'S always do good in England...😊
To all indians one message you can speak in hindi because no English people watches cricket seriously so you will find indians only in comment section so speak in hindi
Anderson to kholi ... 2014 ..
Please, upload the highlights in 1080p. A series of this intensity deserves it
And the Kohli-Anderson rivalry continues
Virat Kohli-0 so what,king is king  This is not ind vs eng this is now jimmy vs king Kohli 🤘
All the best ❣️ India ❤️😘☺️
Virat duck- ly
Ms Dhoni should learn something from anderson. Dhoni became tuk tuk Dhoni as he got older and lost matches for india. On the other hand anderson is still fit and producing match winning spells
Thappad khayie aap Lucknow me hai.🙏
ECB editors have time to show single runs but no time for showing DRS! 🙂🔥
C pujara and A Rahane ke bas me ab nhi hai test cricket me run banana
10:12 bairstow running 😂😂😂
Today Ben Stokes was remembered by kohli 😄 But  kohli will be back with a bang🔥 it's just a matter of one big inning 🙌
Kholi bhai ghar jao...plzzzzz
And the whole crowd erupts ...
James Anderson again shows age is just a numb ...........I think eng miss the trick here........Sam Curran bowl only 1 over in 1st 27 overs he should be given the new ball.......but ind played new ball really well
Every time I see Pujara playing in these conditions, I don't see any confidence in his batting.
Till now rahul is playing a gem knock for india
Kohli Briging Gold To India....Golden Duck🤡
Don’t worry king kohli we are with you. He got dismissed on ball of the century if vadapav would have thier he would have got dismissed very badly king you played well and roshit was struggling on every delivery 😂 vadapav for a reason😂
What is use of being the king..getting out in Golden duck..
Jimmy is Jimmy. Humko Jimmy hi mangta.....
Cheers with huge sound by the crowd after Kohli's wicket 👍
हम नए जरूर है पर सनातन धर्म के लिए जी जान लूटा देने वाले है पर तकलीफ थोड़ी सी तब होती है जब अपने सनातनी हिन्दू भाई भी सपोर्ट नहीं करते पर कोई बात नही आज नहीं तो कल उन्हें एहसास होगा हम सच्चे सनातन सिपाही है और साथी एक भी रहेगा तो लोगो को जागते रहेंगे, ये संकल्प लेकर ही मैदान में उतरे हैं। हमे देखने के बाद जिनका दिल करेगा साथ देंगे नही तो अकेले ही हिंदुओ को जगाता रहूंगा ।
That's why I think sachin is far better than kohli
When Anderson took second wicket, I started cherishing, but the very next moment I saw Kohli's face and stilled as hell bro.
After playing the shot Rohit immediately said "MC".... 🤣🤣7:26(watch closely)
India vs England. ECB YouTube channel:  Now it's time to get 1.4b Indian audience.
And pitches of today cricket mostly batting tracks
Kohli during every match -                                                1 enters in  the field  2- got out on the very first ball 3-reacts like that is the ball of the century  4- leave 😂
Why is pujara getting so many chances after continuous failures??I hv no idea..he lost his intent and seemed like not regaining it.
Every time kohli gets out he reacts like he got out on the ball of the century (unplayable delivery)😂🤣
What about king kholi????????????????????????????????????????
Every time kohli played bad on important occasions or he made a shameful records kohlians always shows his previous stats  as if his previous stats will help us to win a match in future or a icc tournament for us they never except that kohli played badly or it is his mistake they always make excuses 😂🤣🤣
Time to say goodbye to Rahane and Pujara, and bring some youngster . How many chances will they be provided? Been years and hardly they look confident, kholi is not behind them, he needs to score big runs if not a new test team from batting point of view is need of hour.
In recent time no bowlers have ability like that time bowlers
That swing delivery to dismiss Pujara was sublime.
Missing kohli form.
9:15 and the noise of the audience
Com'on England Harao in behnchodon ko
Anderson keeps getting better with his age.
Thank god Kohli nhi tha AUS m 🤣
How well Kl has played...even Rohit managed to play well prior falling on a loose shot...Jimmy Anderson you beauty....
James Anderson taking advantage of his home condition... No worries KL Rahul is still there 💪
Jimmy is gold...👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Jadugar anderson....
Klass
Everybody targeting kohli...just after one innings ...still 9innings to go..so pls everyone shut ur mouth...
JM anderson 619 test wicket 🔥🔥🔥
I think sachin is great then kohli because at that time sachin plays against McGrath Ambrose  Walsh warne Donald Pollock wasim waqar Shoaib bond etc they all are legends
dont forgot kl rahul today he batted really good even after 2 years of no test cricket
Jimmy my boiii❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Kohli busy with Instagram and posting pictures on social media so fell little behind at the crease today… lol …
Just compare the reaction of Jimmy Anderson after Pujara and Kohli's wicket.
Rahane cmon brooo
Clouderson struggles against Steve Smith but easily destroys Virat kohli
Anderson plyed 162 test kumble 132  still he is equal with him thats why he is a normal bowler same is the case with broad
Drop pujara and rahane... Bring vihari
Rahane and Pujara's time has come. Our bench strength is too strong to see these two making the same mistake over and over and over again. Mayank and Vihari are waiting.
Kohli note made a century since 2018 🤣🤣
Same baller same batsman same country same mistake by kholi
Please show original lbw wickets review
Lemme make a prediction : tomorrow India will put on another 60-70 runs before being bundled. England will bat for almost a day and a half and score 220 odd and India will be all out in the second innings at about 170 and loose the match.
Ah india.. Land of billions and yet can't master one form of sport despite cramming every ounce of resource into it at the expense of others.. Failed team.. failed sporting nation.
Except rain I just love England playing conditions and great crowd which does not make any stupid noise...
Pujara is playing his last test for India..... thank u pooooorjara
Kohli ki baski na h ab bekar ho gaya shadi ke baad
English celebrate wicket of Kohli Me - we won without Kohli in aus , we have shardul thakur , also ash who batted well against England in india and scores more run than Kohli
Kholi is Anderson bunny
Bad luck virat better luck next time.
Jimmy my hero
Jimmy the GOAT
please make rahane the indian captain for test team please  Mr.Kohli sir please get your head straight and do not break our hearts  atleast play your part so that the team does not suffer :(
Kamaal Lajawab Rahul 🤴
Vk careless shots sucks
Jimmy Anderson's  is class bowler
Pujara needs to be backed no matter what. He and ajinkya rahane are the only complete test players in the team.
Kohli se achha to Ashwin ko le lete team me BC 1 run to maarke hi de deta 🤣
Why is the commentary so biased
No doubt jimmy Anderson is a legend  But indian never accepted because he always jealous
I feel for Pujara..everytime he is out on the ball of the century !!
England supporter from Pakistan...,.,.,..,.. India will lose in shaa ALLAH in shaa ALLAH
Sounds of the bat.. Cricket
Kamal Lajawab Rahul
The Most Over rated Sport of India 😂😂, Baarish aaya Match stopped, Poor Light Match Stopped, Poor pitch Matchs stopped , They have only 4-5 good teams Which they will Play against for another 500yrs and bore us like anything 🙏, Reason Why India is Doing Bad in other sports
Kohli🔴 Rahane 🔴🔴 Pujara 🔴🔴🔴
Some mysteries are unsolved in the world ,as like Jimmy's, how he maintain his fitness and skills at this stage .. ..he is inspirational for many ..of us.
Rohit sharma always fights hard for his 30-40 runs then suddenly plays a kind of shot that isn't expected or is required he just throws away everything
Hamare Virat kholi Ko nazar lagai hai
So statisfying seeing kohli going for a duck 🤣🤣
Anderson bowl to Pujara is pure classic Anderson ball at his best .  No one can survive on that ball .
Love you England team🇵🇰
Jimmy is a $ living fossil $
EXCELLENT- great exceptional Legend bowler , talented, intelligent , charming and great attitude bowler.👏👏❤🤩🤩
Bulana zra un bhosdiwalo ko jo wtc m gill ko defend kr rhe th aur bol rhe th kl se accha gill h. Kl 2 saalo se nhi khela h, bla bla bla. Mne tb bhi kaha tha kl was dropped just bch he was no able to convert his 50's into tons. His conversion rate is very poor. Only 2 fifty out of 10 gets converted into a ton else he's a Klassic player 👍
Virat will come back may be. but What a bowler he is Anderson 39 and getting Younger as a bowler 🤔
Pakistan going to win with new zealand 2021 wellcome newzealand tour of pakistan
Thanks for upload this video
Drop pujara and Rahane
Anderson is the greatest legend
KL showed his class.
England Cricket highlights used to be edited really well before.
This Series Is GOINg to be Awesome😎🔥
Curran and robinson bowled exceptionally well and Anderson also bowled well in 2nd spell
Sometimes I wonder with that English weather around, how were these folks were even able to invent games like cricket and soccer???
come on shift that unrated vibe from kohli from past 2 yrs this man just eating fruits of what he had done in past and now it is completed so please give us something so we can say kohli is King. A shot from a player in pressure and we call him professional.
Bloody arrogant king Kohli will be the reason if India loose this match. Sharmaji time to lead.
Man I Just love the game . I just love Test Cricket❤️❤️ I remember going to watch Ind vs Eng test match at wankhede those 5 days were so good. Miss that
Anderson is the Master of ball 🐐  Well Played KL Rahul, you are perfect for every format ✌😀  Virat, still waiting for your 100, it's been an eternity 😢  Rahane, it wasn't your day 😓  Fact: Rohit got out on his favourite delivery 😑  Sam Curran got a hairstyle man😅  4:40, Why those Englishmen are in Suits 🤔
Unusually long highlights for a truncated days play
Why don't anyone sledge him after taking kohli..... 😂😂😂😂😂
King 👑 is only one kohli out karney pe noise dekho celebration dekho pata chal gya kohli kohli hai
Virat kohli bad luck Anderson great comeback 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Virat kohli is over.... He should retire now
kohli is king.. 😂😂
Pant or rahul, out nahi huye to,, england gaya kaam se, maar maar ke, england ka pattar thok dalege, ye dono
Jemes ❤️
Test cricket at its best with the wonderful crowd, I think this series would be bigger than ashes & border gavaskar trophy until unless weather helps.
KL Rahul always champion 1:00%
Great Bowler Anderson. Gets Kohli again. Maybe if he still remains fit. He can get 800 wickets
Comments r filled with ms dhoni
Match moment : Anderson to Kohli  Kohli gone first ball
Rahane run-out was utter stupidity
olly robinson should be added in the odi squad
We should never forget about our great physicians and mathematicians like aryabhatta, who invented zero. And so kohli has taken a initiative to promote ZERO. Thank you kohli 😢🙏🙏
Virat need to focus as we all know that what he is capable of.
Why aren't you showing some ball tracking replays Eng cricket.. U didn't even showed Rahul's dropped catch..
Kohli 1st ball was unplayable. Anderson still has so much to show.
Can we not see the reviews ???
Today Kl Rahul Proved...He is Originally Test Player , Team wasted Him on WTC and Other series , Shubhman Gill , Shaw are Still WIP..Mayank have some Techincal problems..Rohit Rahul Should open in All format of the game..They are to Good..
Pujara need to be thrown out
Tomorrow pant&rahul will make a valuable 5th partnership💙💙💙💙💙
I hate these highlights....baised no replay of lbw reviews nothing wtf
Better luck in next innings Kohli,
Rain and English test are turu love 🙂
Bad time for kohli
Fabulous performance
No soo much fun 😕
Wowwwww what a moment to watch selfish and jealous Kholi getting Duck 🦆 as usual 🤣🤣
പന്ത് മോനും രാഹുലും കൂടി ഒരു കൂട്ടുകെട്ട് ഉണ്ടാക്കട്ടെ 💙💙💙
I don’t know why Rahane still playing for India ..
B
One King wins and the  other looses♥️... Better luck King Kohli for the next time👍❣️
Virat Kohli's wicket always creates confusion among Indian players that's why India lost wicket in a row KL Rahul also would have been dismissed.
First Ball duck for Virat Kohli against Jimmy Anderson 🧐.  Most Ducks For Kohli in 2021 😁  🥴🥴🥴
He can be match winner
what a crowd noise😍 when kohli trouble on duck 😂
Superb bowling by Andy
King kohli continues the form.😎
9:16 😔 Love you virat 💖💝   sri Next time 💖☺ 💯✅
Koli miss centry only by 100 runs😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
Jhonny braistow should be the wicket keeper of this match
Instead of showing a boundary from four different angles the editors should show the drs ball tracking as well..
Ye rs jo h always wicket dega glat shot
Jimmy Anderson GOAT 🐐
You can predict the boundary with lovely bat sounds 😍🔥
Such a good start gone in vain. India for once please get a decent lead and prove everyone wrong.
Weather is supporting their team
Alastair Cook said on morning: This Indian batting looks strong in paper but its vulnerable to swing bowling. Even Kohli cant got runs,Ominous signs for Indian batting once again. Bowler's effort wasted once again is on the cards just like WTC final.
Just like old times!!! Jimmy Anderson You Beauty!
Kohli bad luck 😍😍😍😍
🦆VK🦆
Kohli-whatsup Jimmy...  Jimmy- how is that....
36k views lol
Jimmy jimmy jimmy. aayo aayo🔥😚
Kholi ka time khatam abh humko new players per dyan dena chahye
9:16   One of The Glorious moments in Cricketing  History
Remember Shoaib Vs Sachin 1999 Calcutta... This Kohli's wicket first ball was a replay.. Very special moment in cricket
9:17....goosebumps😍
10:00 the moment I have been waiting since 2nd September 2019. Finally KL is back, Hope Virat is also in good touch
Missing VK's form...😢😢😢
Virat Kohli's wicket was very crucial in this game.
Kohli ko kya ho gya Hai
Sir Jimmy Anderson.
Why removed hindi uploaded video of 1st day
James Anderson alone is enough against the Indian side. He is a legend and will always be one
3/4 of the chat filled up with fake Indian cricket YouTubes spamming in the channel
Why KL Rahul dropped catch is not shown when he was batting at 52* 🤔
Who thinks Johnny bairstow looks like Ron weasly from Harry Potter
Anderson is Old by age but his ball still swing like a young age boy😲😳
Finally ecb has produced decent highlights 👍
We need to back kohli
Ind🇮🇳❤ kl is classy 🙌 going on IND ❤❤❤
Day 3 Day 4 complete washout on cards , this match doesn't seem to be heading towards a result . Hoping for completely covered stadiums in the future / roof during rain so that we have uninterrupted action.
Virat Kohli ka din bhar gya ab
Why did ecb removed the hindi highlight ? 🤣
ഇവന്മാരുടെ നാട്ടിൽ എന്നും വള്ളം കളി ആണല്ലോ 😂😂. അത് കളിക്കാൻ അറിയാവുന്നവർ ആരുമില്ലേ 🤭🤭🤭🤭...

No.561
England bounce back strongly love you England
Jimmy never gets older
Test Cricket in England and Australia is something else. The vibe, the grounds, and most importantly, the crowds are amazing.
If we see that partnership between pant and rahul in 2018 again then india will be in strong position
Why reviews are being skipped in highlights???🤨
Gonna be great battle between goats virat and Anderson , currently Anderson won first one , he's ahead ,   BUT DON'T UNDERESTIMATE KING , HOPE HE COMES BACK STRONG 🙂😔
Again the Story continues played well for his 36 then a poor shot that's why  Rahul> Rohit in test matches   Feel bad for rohit..if he Increase his patience level he can be the best test player!
India: not a single Gold in Olympics Kohli : fine then I will do it myself 😂 😂
Anderson 1  Kohli 0
You need to learn how to make highlights
Cricket England never disappoint with pathetic highlight editing.
Anderson 🔥🔥🔥
Just remove rahane pujara.. Regarded as test specialist and always gives away their wicket. Having played for so long but still never seems like they are well settled in the middle. The inconsistent from an experienced players should never be accepted. Just remove them and bring some fresh players that might work.
I think India will still win
Jimmy 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍king of swing 😍😍
Class apart james anderson
Kl rahul take a bow. Playing test match after 2 years . Opening in England and playing exceptionally. He deserves to be first choice.
As a cricket lover I always enjoy Jimi's bowling and want to see him keep bowling upcoming 10 years more
The way those bails flew in that run out reminded me of how Mark Boucher lost his eye. 🥲
Rishab pant wont get a better opportunity, set batsman on the other side , need for release of pressure (cautiously though) and lead the indian comeback.
Its kohli mistake…Kohli played out of the line and Anderson dose t swings the ball evry time and bowls straight to kohli..He is just deceives kohli with his unused variety ball..actually Jimmy tries to swing each and every ball
England comes to bat prefect weather INDIA comes to bat rain no light again rain same in world champion 🏆 IND vs NZ
Upload it quickly yarr itna intezar nahi hota
Rohit always gets a very gd start but he always fails and don't convirt those starts into big score or hundred and throw his wicket away. And our middle order Pujara, Virat, Rahane clueless batting as always. Than who save you the match. Bowlers always set the platform but our batsman always fails. Pant, Jadeja, Shardul, Sundar they not always safe your batting order. It's just enough everytime indian middle order doing same mistake again and again and again in Swinging conditions. Very dissipoint ment from india's🇮🇳middle order. It's time to give more chance to Batsman like KL Rahul, Mayank Agarwal, Suryakumar Yadav in place of Pujara and Rahane.
It's not pair where is Chris woakes
The condition of top order performance of India is really pathetic. From Number 3 to 5, the most vital building block keep on faltering regularly and this is the main reason why they have lost the WTC final and in the process of repeating the same.
Kl rahul is most classiest batsmen in indian batting lineup. Pure class
Laut aao purane kohli 😭😭😭
Jimmy Anderson 🎾 💪💪
Test matches batting is interesting nowadays when Pant is playing !   Agree ?
Waiting for Kohlis Century 😨😰😥😢😭😥😟😣😖😡😠
O no kohli yar
Jimmy Anderson takes a bow. What an exceptional bowler even at 39 age. Absolute legend
Before the match i was excited for kohli vs anderson but anderson vs rishabh pant is more interesting
Channel increasing subscribers when causing to watch Indians
You better bring your A game, Kohli said in an interview just before the game. Well A game it is.
Today's highlights has been uploaded early so that's mean England is on top😂😂😂
C'mon England crush Indian cricket.
Indians fan be like 97 runs k baad ekdum se waqat badal gaye jazbat badal gaye 😁
Rahul's classy strokes were more delightful than Rohit's stand and deliver
Favorite cricket format is test ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Excellent opening batting form Rohit and rahul, this is the highest opening partnership in overseas  tests for india in ten years, hoping for Rahul's century tomorrow
2 centuries nd 4 fifty plus of kholi in remaining matches...Sabar Karo,Ruko Zara
Ben stokes and wocks back for 2nd test
Kl rahul is next big thing he deserves to open with rohit. He should be first choice rather than gill.
Virat sir overrated
Anderson winning again❤️
9:18:Anderson celebration❤️❤️.what a line and length swing ball🔥🔥🔥
Tomorrow India all out 160
Tomorrow it will be best contest pant vs jimmy😎😎😎
Kinguu   kohli   😔😞🥺
Rahane deewana hai aisa out hogaya pak bang bhi aisa nai hote
I hope I believe England win the 1st test
Actually The problem is Cricket is modernised but still it is a Game which needs professional regularity and consistent practice with determination.... Even at the age of 40 Jimmy is still playing FC Cricket for Lancashire.... And our The Great King Kohli  has left playing any of these domestic matches since last 11 or 12 years.... Even being the greatest Fast Bowler of all time Jimmy knows that before the Match he needs the taste of pitch.... But our Great King is always getting out for baby scores and then gives a brilliant expression of grief.I bet Kohli won't be even scoring a 100 in this series
Don’t criticise Kohli but appreciate bowling skills  Good match and well played India so far  Still this test match is not yet over and too early to state anything
1:11 that the buaty
1st battle for the series virat kohli vs James Anderson James Anderson win the 1st battle for the series I am so so so happy
Well the boys had done great till lunch but Ollie Robinson took a wicket and from 97/1 we were 125/4 We lost 4 wickets today which were : Rohit Sharma 36 off 107 balls c Sam Curran b Ollie Robinson  Cheteshwar Pujara 4 off 16 balls c Jos Buttler b James Anderson and Ajinkya Rahane 5 off 5 balls  Runout (Jonny Bairstow) and the remaining batsmen are Rishabh Pant 7* off 8 balls and KL Rahul 57* off 151 balls and we at the end of the day 2 are 125/4
മഴ പെയ്ത പിച്ച്. നാളത്തെ മോർണിംഗ് സെഷൻ ഇന്ത്യൻ ബാറ്റിംഗ് 😰😰😰😰
We all love James....last legendary bowler on earth
Super
Why KL Rahul is ignored in this comment section even though he faced Anderson. See how concentrate and discipline he was today.
Klassic rahul 😚😚😚
KLasically rahul well played 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
Hope that KL Rahul Makes Century 😍😍😍
We have some nice people in India. They feel great pleasure when Kohli fails. I really admire those people!
I wish kindly your 8milion subscriber England and Wales cricket board
Virat is finished in Test cricket. Mark my words he will have a disastrous tour like 2014 . He is struggling to score since 2020. With due respect to kohli. I feel its better he focus on white ball cricket and retire in Test.
India lost the test series 4-1
9:13 😢😢😢😢
End of kohli 🙏
Pathetic kohli can't even stand one ball 😂
Long live Test Cricket, huge applause for English fabs for showing up in huge numbers for test matches, we need to preserve our beautiful game, this is the real Cricket
Long live Test Cricket, huge applause for English fans for showing up in huge numbers for test matches, we need to preserve our beautiful game, this is the real Cricket
Go England and common England
Unlucky kohli missing his century just by 100 runs 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂
England win the test series 4-1
I love you England my favourite team England England is the strong team in the world I always support you England we are England cricket yes I am England cricket and I proud to be a England cricket team fan and England foot ball team fan
In the last match in England. Both these players played really well
Haha Andersons bunny
Anderson is amazing
Watching whole video just to see kholi's reaction 😂
Oh no messi leaving barca 😭😭😭😭😭
King Kohli will be back like what he did in last T20 series against England after getting out on Golden Duck.
y'all newborn hockey fans of one week age hating Cricket without any reason, Cricket contributes yo Indian Gdp BCCI also helping other sports, government doesn't give single rupee to Cricket where as BCCI pays thousands of crores as tax for govt, We can support other sports but hating Cricket because of olympics is illogical Icc planning to include Cricket in olympics in 2028
What an incredible bowler Jimmy Anderson is.Really nothing short of magical even at this age.Kohli's 2014 nightmare has been refreshed yet again by Jimmy Anderson. He is truly a GOAT🐐
WAITING FOR THIS SINCE THIS MORNING Thanks For It ECB
English commentators have a knack of keeping down visiting teams. Or maybe they are just dull & dumb to commentate better.
Dom sibley dropped k.l.Rahul catch ☹️☹️☹️
KL Rahul is the best opener in test cricket in india teams he is better then Mayank Agarwal

With the exception of the 2 old blokes and Root , the rest wouldnt make our village team. England the only team that feels the need to field different players for the different competitions, its a farce so is the England coach half witted mediocre player says all the right things and gets the jobs. England always like the yes man over the winner !!
9:16 Beauty from Anderson🤩  Hard luck for kholi
Virat kohli - Gold to gold howe hai , Medal ho ya duck
Virat Kholi Ko kaha b tha k Apni Wife ka Add na do Instagram par… Ab yahi hal hona tha😁😁😀😂
King kohli vs James anderson 2014......                                                                                            2021???
VIRAT WILL DEFINITELY BOUNCE BACK , AND PEOPLES THAT JUDGE HIM KINDLY PEEP 👀 INTO YOUR OWN LIFE ! HE IS BEST AND HE WILL BE !  SO KEEP CALM , ENJOY 😊 CRICKET ❤️
Celebration conclude that how danger this wicket(of Kohli) is??? If here catch is missed then it's interesting to watch expression on the face of England's players..
I could watch the replay of Kohli getting caught behind against Anderson a thousand times! kohli got lucky against anderson in 2018 edged few times got dropped twice by cook and some other fielders and on other occasions the edge felt short of the slips! I love the great sachin tendulkar the best of all times since 1877 the one bowler he failed to conquer in the later part of his career was jimmy when anderson was young. And now a aged 39 year old Anderson owns the modern indian great kohli too amazing!
One word for Jimmy Anderson:     G.O.A.T🐐
this is probably the last series of broad and Anderson against india so i wants to enjoy every over of these two legends because of them india never won a series in England since 2007 such a master pair this is been for past decade England and world cricket will miss you both
morning section good
RAHUL
The england Crowd always alive the test cricket
❤️❤️❤️james anderson my favorite bowler
I think it's time to change pujara as test specialist batsman 🤞
Jimmy you best in the world man👍

pujara kohli and Rahane are showing collective failure from a long time, Its time to replace them , inject new blood like Gill shreyas and surya whose averages in ranji are 57, 52,43 respectively
Kohli is waiting for his revenge 😍😍
Jimmy Legend Anderson  The G.O.A.T 🐐🙌🏽💯
Who else celebrating India hockey team victory and Ravi dahiya silver 🏅 victory ??
Good
तुम्हारे विकेट से ज्यादा हमारे आउट के चर्चे हैं । 😎
Anderson will be the top wicket taker in the world cricket in test history. His name will spreads for his outstanding swing.
Bouncer ball great to Indian
Duckohli Biography 21 Odi centuries are against Zim, WI, SL ,Ban 12 of remaining 22 are at home So 10 away centuries against top teams Real Minnow Basher and a home track bully 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Why the hell Rahane is in hurry for singles can’t he freaking wait dude should be calm and breathe some air
Jimmy Anderson 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
When clouds are on , wickets started to tumbling
What makes you think that outcome of this series would be any better than 2018 series for India?
Runs depend on luck, Kohli gone for  a duck, Wish ENG'll comeback.
Kohli out.Look at the enjoyment anderson 😘😘.he knew the importance of wicket👍👍
39 nd still going 🐐
9:17 wow 🔥🔥 Andy on fire
Kohli 😩😭
Rohit Sharma isn't made for test cricket
Anderson ❤️ Respect from India and Love
Its sad to see Indians being happy at Kohli scoring a duck!
Jimmy u beauty taken Kohli
that was more like Raul 😂😂
KL Rahul-The lone warrior 🔥
Props to kl and Rohit Bhai for surviving the swing
Jimmy, you're brilliant... legendary.....if the bowl swings .....you can take the  wicket of even bradman,viv richards, gavaskar, Tendulkar,lara,dravid,kallis,sangakara,crowe,ponting,border,barry richards,de villiers and kohli for fun.
James anderson is a goat ❤️❤️❤️
Kl rahul 🔥 🇵🇰
James Anderson :-  swing king  👑 Who agrees?
King kohli out,crowd cheering to Anderson 😘😘.
India will bounce back tomorrow 💪  Sorry  Rain will be back tomorrow 🌧🌧🌧
Very well bowled Anderson
1:10 this shot is called class of rohit
Clouderson
Missing Kohli the beast 😒
Agar Virat Kohli .. apne ego aur aithan me dhyaan dene ki jagah.. Cricket me dhyan de na ..  toh better hai.. No offence Plz 😌
Master of swing... Jimmy Anderson 😀😍🥰
7:18 aur yaha match palta diya rohit ne ek baar phir average shot khel kar, Durham ke practice match se sabak lena chahiye tha
Anderson vs kohli🔥🔥🔥
Awesome playing india
"""""If you remain humble, people will give you love and respect even after you have finished the game.""""” ..
Anderson v/s Virat...new Rivalry chapter 🔥🔥
Kohli is still vulnerable to the line outside off i.e. the line on 5th stump. In 2014, he had just no clue about where his off stump was but in 2018, he covered all his weaknesses and played brilliantly. I guess, because he hasn't been at his best form in the recent times, he wants to feel bat on ball at least at the start of his innings, that's why he played that ball. Had it been 2018, he would've left it. But at the end of the day, we are all humans and we all make mistakes and I have the trust that Kohli will surely be back into form sooner than later.
Kohli the king vs anderson the legend 🎳🎆🎆🎇🎇🎇🎇
James Anderson is toughest for virat  kohli to bat after Amir❤️😉
James Anderson 39 years old☹️.first ball wicket class batsman king kohli😍😍.

This happens when King 👑 meet An Emperor 👑
This is exactly why I stopped watching cricket and started thoroughly enjoying the Olympics.
No - 4 Most wicket  taker in test cricket - James Anderson.
Horrors of 2014 are alive now for Virat Kohli. Hope he bounces back
“Whatever you want to do, do with full passion and work really hard towards it. Don’t look... anywhere else. There will be a.. few distractions, but if you can be true to yourself, you will be successful for sure.”"""..
High time for king 👑 now. Need to perform
I hope Kohli comes back strong after this. It will be a sweet comeback. But he definitely needs a break from social media and the 'influencer lifestyle'. It's drowning him deep into the pits of mediocrity.  Anderson's been a favorite for a long time now, even if people call him 'clouderson' on his bad days he is one of the best out there. It will be real sad when he would retire from all formats.

I know Virat Kholi is not a good caption but good a batsman
Waiting for Rishav Pant ulta pulta shot tomorrow
Jimmy, most wicket taking pacer,  if not missed those matches due to form and injury, would surpass warne already.
Rohit Sharma op ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Kadak re... India 🇮🇳India 🇮🇳🙌♥😀😎👌🇮🇳🙌
One minute silence for those who are waiting for rohit sharma's overseas century 👍
What a comeback from England excited for next
ജെയിംസ് ആൻഡേഴ്സൺ ❤️❤️
Just wait...  King kohli 👑 will be soon with a bang 🔥🔥
Fact : Love to watch cricket matches in england
Kl Rahul proves how good he was in test format as a opener 😘❤️😘
KL Rahul 💯 Loading 🇮🇳♥️
Class of Anderson is permanent 👑👑👍😎
CLOUDERSON IS BACK 😂
As expected, rain dominates day 2. India id say is still in the driver's seat and the rain came at a really good time for them. They can now take a step back, plan and rebuild. So far 2 sessions shared, 2 for india and one for eng.
Aur fir twitt ke bole ge  ,,vaah kya scene hai🙃🙃🙃🤔🤔🤔
India will win coming soon🤘🤘🤘
India win 100 % ...  🇮🇳💪
Well played Rahul
Everybody busy between England and India... Le Rain-: Ruko jara Sabar kro🤚🤚
Lagta hai aaj modi ji batting karne aaye ge
Kl rahul 🔥🔥
Pant stay some time after big short s
Well Played India.... Especially KL Rahul 😍😍😍....   But Kohli Got Duck 😑😑😑
From 97-0 to 125-4 again Middle order struggle 😰
feeling bad for Rohit! pull shot is one of his strengths in white ball..bt in red ball he has been failing in this shot! and again today he was tempted 🙂! and he couldn't resist..😪
What happened  to king kohli ?
James Anderson has equalled Anil kumble's tally of 619 test wickets
JIMMY IS FOREVER BOWLER FOR ENGLAND AS BUM BUM BUMRAH FOR INDIA
Great bowling Jimmy
India 🇮🇳🇮🇳
Who should open in T20WC? 1. Rohit-Rahul...likes 2. Rohit-Dhawan... comments
It's hard to see kohli in this position I Remember those days when Everytime India play only kohli vs11 other players battle we saw 😔💔💔
Anderson king of swing❤️🏏🔥
Hii
Plz sir pin the comment sir plz ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ love from india
Kohli is becoming a motivational speaker rather than performing in match For the people who think I hate Kohli, you are wrong, I am a diehard fan of Kohli but he is not performing well these days as all of us have seen…
🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
🎶 ohhh  Jimmy Jimmy............Jimmy Jimmy Jimmy Jimmy Anderson 🎶
Though I am an Indian but Anderson is my favourite bowler,my mentor and inspiration. I was so excited to see him take wickets.
Hahahahah kohli😂
Jimmy anderson aged like a fine Pinot Noir!
Kohli failed as usual lol😂😂😂😂
Whatever the partnership is... one wicket is jzt  changing the game
But Anderson the wicket taker ablities wow but kohli 🙄🙄🙄
Virat Kohli 💔

Great bowler in the world james anderson
Happy to see Rahul back in form
Anderson vs Kohli what a battle ! I am sure Kohli is gonna win it later in the series. 🤞🤞
India always slipping from dominant Position.
The moment when kholi got out was the best feeling for ever
Fun fact: The 47th over of India's innings will probably be the longest over ever to complete.
Anderson the  magiccc man
Kohli thought he was in the Olympics.  In search of a gold medal, he got a golden duck    Please take it on a lighter note
At the age of 39, bowling like this Anderson is real GOAT🔥
