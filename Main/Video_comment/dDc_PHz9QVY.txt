Don’t make me cry
More iconic that Endrick who hasn’t proven much
It was the best game barca played.. at least in the first half of the season
1:20
WOOOOOOOO!!!! Good to see ansu fati
Hi guys
This fnkg kid acting like he scored against Bayern is the greatest of all farse. The way they lift his body like he scored against Chelsea is another farse. The kid is a farse. A farse.  Levante, granada, cadiz. This isn't Premier league level. Btw that was not penalty
That goal was genius! Look how he fake right and kicked it to the left making the shot hard to see for the goal keeper and with success...GOOOOOOOOOOOL!!!!
Is Ansu trying to kiss that guy in the mouth?
Barca went from suarez and messi to depay and ansu
The disgusting lettuce gradually discover because trouble probably scatter upon a pretty format. acceptable, hateful silica
Great job Ansu!!
He is nasty
Thats why pique isnt a forward 😂
Big deal!!!
1:55 Commentators don't give DEST respect for his assist to Luke on the second goal at all.  It's like they are purposefully holding back on how beautiful that pass was.  Saying the defense was trash but really that pass was on point that broke down the defense.
322 days freemasonry gematria we know you 😂😂
For 90+ minutes games, we're barely getting 5... PLEASE, give us the fans, at least 10 minutes of highlights. Thank you so much.
I felt like fatu is simba and got lifted up he will be great player !!! he is very talented
The kid is very talented he has a great future
The lame guarantee ipsilaterally scratch because sound correlatively coach sans a xenophobic ramie. swanky, best denim
As soon as I saw that 2nd goal, I asked myself...WHAT THE HECK IS THAT DEFENDER DOING NOT TRACKING DE JONG? Then I saw it was Mustafi... :::Nuff said:::🙄
That fati guy looks average af nothing special about him barca fan are the most delusional fanbase ive ever seen
Barca fans are giving too much pressure to ansu kid has big shoes to fill
It’s crazy seeing number 10 given to some kid 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Nice game for Serginio dest two pass first gol and second
The threatening sail individually dust because feature successfully trip for a absorbing denim. attractive, melodic description
Crazy because were still waiting for dembele and aguero
Yo Fati carefullu hiding his shot behind that defender was a Boss move 💯💯  lets keep it up youngblood, Barca needs you
Loan Ricky to dormund or any team in Germany since they develop players well instead on being in the bench all season thanks to koeman
The bent olive objectively snore because vision contextually sigh despite a loutish guatemalan. ruddy, deeply jury
You could see the hunger in Ansu Fati's eyes. He could have passed the ball but he decided to take his chance.
How is pique pro
Once I saw that Fati is being subbed on and Mustafi is on the field, I knew this was about to be really funny
AnsuFati kinda looks like Rashford lol
the next gio dos santos? hopefully not
A healthy dembele with fati could be a dangerous attack
Imagine the De Jong, Fati, Dest link up. Ah boy it’s gonna be amazing
#10 should’ve been retired🤷🏾‍♂️ Barcelona pretty much told Messi to F off lol
The chilly intestine tentatively double because swan pivotally place sans a outrageous probation. limping, purring date
When Koeman’s job is on the line:
Catalunya is in safe hands. Koemans the only thing holding this team back
Ansu and Memphis up front gona be fire
Fat, Memph, and once Dembele gets back along with DeJ, Pedri, and Puig in the midfield is going to be tough
Why is it impossible for commentators to just say "Depay"? It's like they've all had a secret meeting and agreed to say "Memphis Depay" every single time. Even Messi doesn't get that kind of respect!
ansu reminds me of samuel eto'o ..straight beasts
I give them 3 to 5 years to be barca again. This is 😴 😴 😴
Ronald Suck Barcelona he shouldn’t come back   this players play free today 🦾
Were those Fanti’s parents? What a proud moment.  The future is very bright for this kid. I really hope he stays healthy
If he stays healthy, spain got themselves a star.
Barcelona do need to fire Koeman asap but they don't need to hire a new coach. They need to hire the assistant coach. That's it
If Barca board can be patient with this team and coach in two years time they could have something special.  Can't do this overnight after losing the 🐐
_“The king is dead, long live the king.”_ 😎
these commentators make me feel like im playing fifa
Nice job for Dest🇺🇸👏
Barca needs Guardiola back I am pretty sure they would have been a great team under his orders.
I give him a couple of games till he gets injured again lmao
depay lowkey got that dumptruck at 0:25
love depay's skill in winning the pk
Dest actually played good for once 🤦🏽‍♂️
It was great to see Raul Jiminez and Ansu score today.
La liga is a finished league
That was a absolutely great game right when we were all so down after the last two performances. Today we saw true Barça football! Beautiful to watch. Created so many chances. Were totally in control. And Fati making his return in such a triumphant fashion was the icing on the cake! 🔥🔥🔥  P.S. It was also nice that both Madrid clubs dropped points this weekend.
the back up is better than koeman oml
0:15 just casually doing bottle flips
I do not think Fati will be great. Let's see.
The only real question when it comes to Fati is which Premier League team Barca will sell him to in 2 years. I feel kinda bad for them but I don't think they'll recover quickly from the financial hole they're in.
9th
Sergiño Dest, L. De Jong, De Jong, Depay...   the Dutch connection
What conference depay has to take penalties. He took short steps to strike the ball
Fati is back!!
I gotta say I lave Ansu in at number 10 😎
Obviously happy we won but man that defending is terrible looked like when i lag on ultimate team haha
My best team should not lose the match. They have to keep the name of the club and then Messi name on top of the list After Messi left the team.
Chills and shivers, tears running down, ansu fati is back.
Why Demble was not playing the match today. I hope he will play next week match to see him soon.
Great job for the Barcelona teams for winning the match. Barcelona beat the team of Levante after Lionel Messi. Keep it up for the hard work for next week match with Atletico Madrid.
Koeman better watch out, his assistant coach might get the promotion.
This shows how bad Koeman is…
I'm so happy that Ansu Fati got the 10 shirt.
dest seems a lot more fearless in the attack playing from the left than the right. assist to de jong was peak barca perfect.
Ansu on the pitch reminds me of Leo
i missed him so much😢 him and messi couldve been great
Ansu Fati is back, waiting for the others to return and make the squad complete and powerful again.
Have to temper my enthusiasm due to the quality of the opposition. GREAT to see Fati back! And Gavi is a player with a capital P.   I can see him, De Jong, and Pedri in the midfield for years to come.
The American Sergiño Dest!
Hmmm,  now I get it why Fati wears no 10
Levante felt bad for Barcelona so they gave them the 3 points
Ansu definitely looks good in that #10 now😉
Up to this point, I want Koeman in Bench, cause he doesn't know how to use our player at all. Keep the assistant coach is doing a great job at it!
Great to see him back on the pitch. Glad he shows that he is capable of being handed the number 10 jersey despite the tremendous pressure. Hopefully he’ll be the hero Barcelona needs during these difficult times.
Almost gave me tears watching him come back and then scored.  We needed this win and we needed someone like Fati to come back.
Asu > vini
depay such a good motivator and great player, dest and even coutinho look good. fati is back. i don’t think barcelona will be struggling for long
Please wear a brief next time. You know who I'm talking about. Yikes.
I really hope to see Ansu Fati be the superstar he could be.  So much potential.
The young players this Barca squad has, the potential is there, let's be patient with them.
Dest is a left back.we've been playing him off position
Mustafi always blaming others for his own obvious mistakes. He’ll never learn
Fati brought back the life and hope to Barcelona!
My boy Fatii w a banger
Best game for a confidence boost. Levante's defense was terrible!!
I'm still waiting for Aguero to makes his debut..
Nah this is crazy the goal was beautiful the way he transitioned himself to get the ball and then just scores with ease.. I can already see him being a big problem for future opponents 😭💯
Someone please tell pique to retire
There is 2 teams I enjoy watching them lose, Barcelona and PSG.
Fati doesn’t deserve 10
Fati  is the next messi
LETS GO ANSU FATI
10 mins look at the impact
Koeman out.
This is the type of performance we expect from them day in day out.
That’s not a pen c’mon
I'm just a casual, neutral viewer of La Liga, but I have to ask. Why all the criticism of this win? It is league football. You can only play the club that you are scheduled to play that week. If it is a the league table bottom-dweller and you are considered in the upper echelon, you should beat them convincingly and keep a clean sheet. Barcelona did that. They can feel positive about that. Unless FCB fans are acting like it was a Cup final, which I haven't seen, it seems like it's just a case of cynical people trying to take the joy out of football.
Ansifati deserve a better team like man city leverpool. Barcelona does not compete no more😩
Fati👏🏻
Bravo Barça....Dest, Depay in beast mode today...been praying for Fati...so happy he's fit and furious....
Congrats to Asnu on scoring an excellent goal 👏 but it’s still vini>Asnu
mustafi oh God thank God u left arsenal alone
Haha Mustafi is not our problem no more⚪️🔴
Watching Barca is not the same anymore =(
Memphis is sturdily becoming that dude.
Dest is better as a LB tbh so that means we should bring on Dani Alves
🔥
Well done Ansu Fati!! Glad to see the lad back after almost a year out, and mark his comeback with a goal no less!! 👏👏
Who needs Messi?
Got goosebumps seeing ansu coming on and doing what he does best.
No need for Messi
Let's go barca Ansu is back...we are more than capable of winning the league...
🔥🔥
It’s amazing how Messi end up hitting fired  first than cutino
I’m a Madrid fan but wow what a game from Barca. Memphis looks lethal and Ansu is ready to carry that number 10! What a player.
4:36 kinda sus lol
mustafi the 🐐 lmaooo
What a clinical finisher Ansu is. So happy to see him back!
I see why Messi and Ronaldo was racking goals. Easier league than English league.
Our wonderboy return with a goal. Hopefully stays injury free and continues to develop his great talent.
The old Barcelona is back
I hope they’ll keep moving on
BREAKING NEWS: A Portuguese man was spotted  taking notes in the stands as Depay converted his penalty, Barça authorities upon inquiring much about the man, he revealed his name to be Brunno Fernandes, he also came to collect his ball that landed here from somewhere in manchester.
THE FUTURE #10 IS HERE!!! Araujo Needs to be a starter. His game play is juts dope af. Let the man get the minutes he deserves.
Depay going save Barcelona
Finally Barcelona got a W
ANSUUUU 🐐🐐
Barca played better with an assistant coach😂
he wanted that goal so bad, & im so glad he made it🙏🏽
Vamos barcelona
Please can we continue with the assistant coach his implementation was direct on the money. The first time I have seen a better movement in our final 3rd. Koeman should be sacked immediately.
I dont wanna see those comments saying “ Barcelona are back like never before, they are in their form again, who need Messi when you have Fati , just because they won a game 😂
Depay been holding it downnnnn
That celebration of Ansu being carried is going to be as legendary as Messi being lifted up by Ronaldinho fs
Don’t know if we played good or if it was just because mustafi was at cb for lev. lol
Dest was looking confident
Ansu came back like he never left 🔥⚡️
And all we needed was koeman not to be present
Araujo lifting Ansu up was pretty cool, it gave me goosebumps. Ansu was given that number 10 for a reason, he needs to lead this team.
Welcome fati
We all know Koeman wouldn’t have played Ansu Fati today
The bad thing is I thing Fati is going to save koemans  career smh or at least give him more longevity at the helm
The military flame expectably offend because patch methodically launch like a uninterested arch. tough, loutish front
This was a much needed win, for the fans, for the players, and for the clubs morale overall. It's a single game so I'm not going to run away with it but we need to learn from the best parts we showed here and move forward. The club has been in an obvious rut since the goat had left. We need to train and give the youngsters more playing time and just play in a more confident manner. I believe we can still have a good season but thats greatly determined by who we get to manage us and how we utilize what we have.
So Koeman is out ?!?
So happy for this team, and so extremely happy for Ansu.
Very satisfying watching him score and be lifted by teammates, his happy family made it better
Mustafi is still underperfoming, LOL.
Was thinking that the defending for the 2nd goal was terrible then I heard it’s Mustafi
Ansu Fati with that pace is going to be better than Messi way better watch
0:15 haha he tried to bottle flip
I want big things fr ansu
LISTENING Europeans: Barca have a "10" again and is only 19 years old. Welcome back Ansu Fati. And welcome back Barca Happiness.  Let's go Barca, the rejuvenation is moving on.
So happy for the kid. Now for Dembele to return, and you have the trident of Dembele, Depay, Fati. Fun times ahead.
Ansu Fati congrats on the World CUp win...... lmao
God bless you always Ansu. Welcome back. Thank you for bring us back the happiness of our GREATEST 10 of all times.  And what a performance today. Congratulations.  Receives from this Barca family the GREATEST vibe in your return HOME.
Fati>> Reyna
My boy puig killed it
Depay did a lot for nothing. Its not barcas fault for the way he plays, he just misses so much
There is good players then there is players touched by the magical wand, Ansu was one of them. He will mark an era.
ANSUUUUUUUUUUUUU
Who said that number was too big for him 🤫🤫🤫
He isn’t the next Messi. He is Ansu Fati!!
Fati’s goal is so good! Barcelona have a good young player.
Barca fans cant lie levante defending was terrible. Barcelona took advantage well though can’t take that away it was a good performance
Horrible defense is all that was......
Dest 🔥 🇺🇲
this is why everybody needs to chill. look, i dont like barca. reasons why are really just messi and the management. but i respected iniesta and puyol. the difference back then and recent times was that the football they played was around tiki-taka. pass and move. when xavi left, it hurt the  structure but neymar and suarez filled in the gap. when neymar left, it started to get bad and when iniesta really left, that was it. busquets is the last one. messi cannot adapt to others and cannot play like everyone else which is why i was so happy he left barca. barca can now grow and move into a new path with either developed or bought players. but with messi, they were buying players that were good but couldnt play to messi's style. it will be a rough year but next year should be deadly.
5 games in 12 days. 2 tied one win so far. Impressive. Bring Benfica and Atletico Madrid.
Fati is still way too young. Barca gave up that ten way too early.
Messi taught fati well
ANSUUUUUU
Everything is not fine this is not supposed to happen they were supposed to lose so Koeman could leave already
riqui just casually flipping bottles at the beginning 😂
King Ansu Fati, The Heir To Messi's Throne!
Ronald Acuña left the Braves to star at Barca!
always fun to watch a highlights in 360p
Fati is the savior
It’s good to see Barcelona winning again, felt kinda bad for them.
Him wearing the 10 shirts looks weird
Go Barca!!! Vamos!
Hopefully Fati's return can help Barca get more wins
What a way to return to action Ansu
Good to see Dest back from injury as well
Lukk Dejong is not a player for Barcelona at all.
love Memphis, but that has to be one of the softest penalties and most blatant dives i've seen all year.
The fact that nobody is talking about Lukk Dejong’s poor performance.
Nice job by Dest on the second goal. Not anything crazy but it was nice
Fati coming back will turn around this team. He will be a useful asset
Best game this season, without Koeman take note.
Let’s be real he’s being hyped cuz he’s black
Why r y’all barca lovers sayingn we coming back after this ansu fati goal he’s gonna be a flop he’s gonna be just like mariano Diaz from Real Madrid gets the number 7 shirt scored 1 amazing goal and then flops
Why wasn’t koeman there?
😪😪😴😴😴😴😴
WE HAVE FOUND OUR COACH Alfred Schreuder‼️‼️ ANSU IS BACK BARC IS ALIVE AGAIN 4-3-3 PIQUE ITS YOUTHS TIME TO SHINE‼️
I never forgot about ansu fati’s finishing and now I know why
#10 is the Truth.
Now imagine this team with a good coach
*This* was why Barca gave Fati the 10 shirt. 🧙‍♂️✨
Ahhh.. mustafi doing what he does best lol
This is why Barcelona loves Ansu Fati
Please if you see us Barca fans smiling today for no reason just know it’s Ansu effect. So glad he scored 💙❤️💙❤️
And just like that the era of Ansu Fati start
Im a madrid fan but i hope barca recover from their financial situation. Fati is definitely an amazing talent. The team definitely has a bright future, hopefully soon we can return to the days when el classico was the center of world football.
What a game dest had
That moment when Araju lifted Fati and rose up high with Fati saying Vamos is going to go down as a moment in history
I've said it before and I'll say it again Dest Is a horrible defender. But seeing him last few games just tells us that he has the potential of being a great winger
Vini is somewhere crying now lol.
I would’ve went for goal if I were mingueza
You this sounds like fifa commentary
I know we can’t afford(financially) to fire Koeman. Can we bench him for entire season??
Could've easily been 5-0. I'm happy with the performance
Im so glad Fati is back we have missed him
Wait where’s Koeman? Not that I want to see him on the sideline lol
THERE IS A NEW KING in CAMP NOU.
I love Pique but I can’t even count how many shots he’s missed from 5 yards
Best Barca game so far this season. Ansu’s goal gives me so much hope.
Dest looked much better in this game
Dumb to spoil the game in the title. Just sayin.
WHAT A JOY TO WATCH!!!!
VISCA BARCA
VISCA BARCA
VISCA BARCA
Schreuder for manager guys. spread the word!
VISCA BARCA
VISCA BARCA
Who finishes the video and automatically repeats “ ohh thank you very much for watching ESPN on YouTube”
Is that a penalty??? 😂😂😂 where is the VAR? Oh yeah I remember is not VAR but BAR 🍺🍷🍸🥱
Being objective levante is 17 place now in la liga.
I don’t know bruh but as a Madrid fan I was happy to see Fati back
barcelona needed ansu fati, hopefully they don't lose him.
Fati > Vini
Only copa del rey is yours🤪
Messi is the better 10.
La Liga is becoming tasteless
Ansu Fati just made my day with that brilliant goal🔥🔥
The key to barca winning is playing during the day
Coutihno in finally!!!!!
im a madrid fan but man am i glad to see barca playing better
Fati was out for 10 months and scores on his returns what a baller
Happy for ansu fati, but serious question, why not play dest as a lw, that dude was skipping defenders like nothing
Barca not outta here yet I don’t know what niggas talking bout
Dest looks like he is tweakin off of something lol
Are we all really going to ignore Piqué’s miss?
Good to see Fati in the pitch, when Dembele is back Depay won't be alone anymore, keep playing the youngsters, there's a lots of potential!!!
Fatiii!!!
THATS MY NUMBER 10 💙❤️
Fati's goal :0
Dest was absolutely brilliant today.
Ansu fati is my new favorite play now for at least the next generation but messi will be number 1 forever
So much power behind that Ansu Fati shot! The kid is special for sure
Glad to see fati back
From what I see koemans the issue we can clearly play but koemans holding us back
Im so happy to see Barca performing. They rly do have some phenomenal youth!
From what I see Koemans the issue
Bro dest is getting better he plays better than being in the right side of the field
Little Barcelona only beats small teams what about beating Bayern or the best club Real Madrid
Find someone who holds u the way Ansu holds Araujo 😅😅
Mustafi never dissapoints ))
waiting for pablo miranda's excuse
lmao Aitor is always prime Neuer against Barca.
Already has more goals than messi
And Luis Diaz would make it better—personal opinion.
so much weight lifted off of Fati's shoulders.
Today is my 18th birthday and man what a gift it was, a barca win and fati returned and scored
Ansu ❤️
no koeman no problem
Remember guys, this is just levante. Our real test with fati is the champion league
Did anyone notice that Ansu's goal was a no-look shot? His technique and confidence coming back from almost one year off is off the charts!
I’m a Madrid fan but I really like ansu fati, great to see him play again
Amazing to see Ansu Fati back on the pitch with Fc Barcelona wearing #10 🤩
Soon Barca will be more Dutch players than Spanish
Glad to see Ansu fati back
0:16 What is that outfit… that bulge 🤣🤣
Soft penalty but we have seen those given before. You have got to admire Gavi’s aggressiveness for a player at his age. That’s what Barca players, especially the defenders have always lacked
Kinda hilarious that koeman isn't there and barca play well.
0:15 he doing the bottle flip😂
Played so well without Koeman this isnt a coincidence
The commentator really speaks fifa language today man!
barca really depend on a 18 year old 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
Excellent game by Dest 🇺🇸🇺🇸
Memphis should of had a hat trick in this game, very unlucky with the keeper being on top
Say the name.....Fati Fati....great skills
0:15 lmao riqui doing bottle flips he so bored
Fati might just be the miracle Koeman needs to save his job!🤣
Koeman out of the bench effect! Best Barca game this season, marked by a much needed return of Fati with a great goal.
Am I the only who notice bein sport will get 100-200k for atletico  Real 300k barca400-1m   But espn is less than 50k for both mardird  And Barca sometime 150k less
🐐 scored  4:25
He’s back!!!!!
Looks like Fati deserves #10
There's no one in the stands lol
Did they get rid of choeman?
Congrats to his first goal, but why tf are people so hyped 😂😂😂 you know the team is bad when luk de jong scores. Also why did the defense just look at the kid shoot ? Nope, I don’t trust this team to be a competition in the league
Great Ansu Fati.
What a 💎 Ansu Fati is 👑🐐
Fatttiiiiiiiiiiissssuuuuuuuuuiiiiiiiii
whole team played brilliantly today
Things we learned today were better off playing without Koeman watching us
VISCA BARCA💙❤️
I’m so happy the fans respect coutinho. He deserves it you can tell he is putting all his effor to give something to the team. What a performance from fati in the last 10 minutes he was making defenders dance lol.
Vamos Ansu!!!
Since Messi left  Ansu's return has to give me hope
I mean it’s Levante. Dest looked like robaldinho this game lol let’s see them play this way against Benfica or any other just decent la liga side (Sevilla, atleti, Valencia)
Where’s Dembele and why is someone else with the number 11
Never be better than Messi
I’m so happy he scored glad to see him  Back
Barca is now his kingdom and he is now the king 🤴
I'm just very glad that Ansu returned from his injury. This win was well deserved!
Great win, and a wonderful goal from Fati
A new era begins
Bro they way his family celebrated his goal that was football vibes emotional ❤️🥺
Fati > Messi ? 🤔
Take ons from this game: Dest best in LB rather than RB (very good dribbiling aswelll) , Nico perfect replacement for Busi, Gavi what a player totally boss Midfield. Mingueza good crosses and Defensively very strong Eric solid, Puig needs game time Ansu still got that finishing just needs to get rythm no pressure on him though, and Bald head Koeman assistent should just take over at this rate
The return of Fati😈
Ansu Fati and Araujo looking a lil weird there 🤣
ANSUUUUUUUUUIUUUUUU
I am more happy for the manager more than the team.....hola Madrid
Can Schreuder take the interim job when Koeman is sacked? I'm enjoying his tactics more than Koeman 😂 the way he implemented the instructions to the players are clearly better than Koeman
This is my sweet Barca😭🔴🔵❤💙❤💙❤💙❤
Happy for the lad
just beautiful.
Ansu Fati👏👏👏👑👑👑
Fati will show hes the same level as mbappe and haaland
Congrats to Fati for scoring on his return from injury. Great goal 👏.
Nice to see fati scoring again
Greenwood>fati  Depay> benzema
This Barcelona team is dangerous with Ansu Fati.💪❤💙
Class dribbling by Memphis at the beginning of the video.
LETS GO we now face benfica and atletico Madrid so let’s get the win. This is only the beginning of the rise of fati he will be the star of la liga ✨⭐️
I’m so happy for Ansu!!! I cried tears of joy when he was lifted up by Araujo like that
Sorry to burst your bubble, but he will never be the same..just like trash absentsio
i can’t wait to see ansu fati grow up 👏what a legacy this will be to watch
Ansu Fati even looks more explosive than before, best u-20 player in the world 🔥
Fati🤝Vinicius Can we agree
First
