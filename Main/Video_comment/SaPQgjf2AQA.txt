How much glass have you braked?
Ok no I just feel bad he really fell inside a puddle
Oh, man. I’ve definitely been there before. One day after my classes were over, I was joyfully riding my BMX bike to the bus stop on my college campus. I randomly decided to try and show off just because I was feeling myself since it was finally the weekend. I tapped my rear brake to do a little skid, but I didn’t notice that the concrete was damp. That “little skid” turned into a full on 180 degree slide and an immediate fall to the ground. Right at the bus stop loop in front of everyone waiting to leave campus, too. Totally embarrassing. I put my bike on the front rack and boarded the bus with a ripped shirt, skinned knee and elbow, and a very bruised pride. Literally EVERYONE on the bus saw me and asked if I was ok, which was actually nice and thoughtful. I explained that I was fine, then I went straight to the back seat and sat in my embarrassment all the way home where I dressed my wounds and drank a sad beer lol. Hope at least one person reads this funny story. Much love from Texas, y’all!
🤣🤣🤣
You are my best friend dude ، ok let's be logical ، my friend namingly Qasim was  an exact copy of you، so that's why I see him in you
there's always that one boy who is mean to all the girls, hoping they'll find him cool.
He's awesome 😂
Oh sorry i didnt know you were chill like that
🤢 Omg why are guys like that
As a cool guy, this seems fine to me.
I’m a girl and I was like when he was trying to be cool I was like I can do much better and not fall!☺️

funniest
💀
I hope Jim Carey has seen you and given his blessings. It’s like watching his young age in you.
Hey, who wants to turn to Jesus and live for him obey everything he says? This life is temporary once you die you spend eternity in one of two places so choose heaven or hell. Jesus loved you to die for you. He says you all are valuable if you turn from your sins he will bless you like never before and he wants to call you son and daughter but whenever you sin you choose hell and choose to hate God. Now you may say I'm a good person which is actually not true (Mark 10:18). But did you know that not even forgiving others is enough to send you to hell. Jesus is very serious about sin in fact Jesus says most people go to hell and few enter heaven (Mathew 7:13-14). No sin is worth going to hell for when someone goes to hell you can never escape your there forever and you will feel the pain forever . It's not worth it You can live in heaven forever where Jesus serves you food and you can be in God's presence forever where you're never sad or depressed and have a mansion as well. There is Good news If you come to Jesus humbly and confess your sins and beg him for mercy and forgiveness he will forgive you. But you can't continue to willfully sin (Hebrews 10:26) Because Jesus also says if you love me keep my commandments (John 14:15) you immediately need to repent from all your sins (Luke 13:3) and follow up with Jesus. Remember Follow Jesus only no religion no man Jesus rose from the dead. We have 500 eyewitnesses of it. Jesus is coming back soon with no mercy, seek the lord now while he may be found. When he rose from the dead he proved everything he said was true Muhamad or Buddha didn't rise from the dead. If you want more help watch the YouTube channel Cleveland street preachers he has been verified by the holy spirit. Also ask the holy spirit to teach you and to guide you in case you haven't.  Do any of you need prayer?
Wasn’t expecting the fall in the mud😂😂
😂 He gets on my nerves with these videos! They showed up on my feed one day and I just keep watching.
👍
Nice house YouTube has done you good and deserve it too
That's Jim Carrey and Ryan Reynolds son 😂
That ending got me 😂😂😂
🤣🤣🤣
Young Jim Carrey
Ok but the jacket move was hella smoov
Neighbors be like ‘Oh boy he’s at it agai- a puddle this time-?!?! Ok what was that phycologists number…’
She said that I'm a poser but she don't know my style~
Sending this to my best friend who does this 🤣🤣
I’ve done at least 5 of these things :(
Woof
Did you broke a glass while recording the video? 🤪
Damn you don't need to remind me of my teen days, that's what happened to me when I tried to act cool, except it's in a god damn mall and people who saw it laughed. Ah, good times when I had my freedom before getting a job
I have a guy in class like this 😂💀
You mean when a guy tries to be Rajnikanth
Bros micheal Jackson now
I feel observed in my private moments
Oh but of course
This guy is the BEST! Love the fall in the puddle
My dad when he goes to grab a drink from the fridge
So cool he even forgot to close da door
I was seriously expecting him to fall down the stairs. That's where normal people who are trying to act cool invariable fall down lol
I feel like if we just add some _"hee-hees"_ & _"SHAMONAs"_ with a lil moonwalk spin to the closet & fridge... That would be an accurate representation of Michael Jackson at home 😂
Hahahah
As a cool guy myself, I confirm all this to be true 😎
The first part got me laughing about 1 hour
that wasnt cool that was pure fucking cringe fest
Lol
😂
GIVING HOLLYWOOD'S HRITHIK ROSHAN VIBES 😶♨️
When Johnny Cage is home alone
Hilarious!! 😂😂😂😂😂
God damnit..why does he have to be wearing the same sunglasses i wear!
This is me with my crush lol
I hated this. Then you went for the puddle. Well played.
Neighbors be like, "hey Mable, that Daniel boys at it again"!
The END is too funny!! 😂
Michael Jackson as a kid.
This dude has come high level foot skills

Ur so funny man! 😁💗 Thank you for tickling us and making our day. God bless you brother. 😊
You have impersonated my ego.
Who gonna close the closet door?
Please YouTube stop showing me this guy ‘s shorts. So lame
🤣🤣🤣
😂😂😂👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
🤣🤣
Really you are so cool,😉😉
That walk though
Every Indian can relate it with Vibhuti from " bhabhi chat pe hein" 😂😂
The end is hilarious 🤣 Thanks for always making me laugh without saying a word.
My name is Johnny bravo
It’s not really trying too hard to be cool it’s kind of Erratic
😳
🙄
Ooooohhh
I do that spinning with everything in my hand xD but not to look cool but bc of my adhd
In India we have a word for these type of guys, it’s called ‘Chapri Bois’ 😂
I do this but I’m not trying to be cool I just hate it when people stare at me while I’m just trying to get through my day.
Micheal Jackson on a daily basis
Now that is funny.. 😀🤣
,😄😄😄
Lmao
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 oh my goodness
It's the fancy footwork that gets me.😄
😂😂 laughed out loud
He's listening to "Drive that funky soul" in his head
He is more well acting then the character
🤣🤣🤣lmao
Guys like genuinely act like this make my head hurt
Lol that was a good one!!!
Its Soo unattractive 😂
All of the video is great but that stair walk was the most accurate thing ever. Why do people think its cool to flail their arms while going down stairs LOL 😂
I don't know why this gives me backstreet boys vibes
The whole closet situation 😂
My brother is the same😂😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The ending is fire 🔥🤣😂
Lol pride cometh before a fall?😆
That guy is pretty cool.
Спасибо. Подрачу
Reminds me of a rooster strutting around. 😅
Omg the ending 😅🤣
🤣🤣🤣 on dirait Fonzy dans Happy Days 😂😂😂🤦🏾‍♀️
I am really impress of the reflexes of this guy😂
Jesus loves y’all! God bless y’all!! “Jesus is the way, and the truth, and the life.” John 14:6
Oh god the ending 🤣😬
Him trying to be cool reminds of james from big time rush
This is 100% me LMAO THE END
WOOOOOW he is so coooool i want to be like him
This is me when I complete 1 line of my essay
He really took that bath in the puddle 😳😲😆🙈 Wow...I hope he didn't had to do that fall more than once🙈
Aka 8th grade boy
Too many styles, that's not good either... 🗿🗿🗿
Even though I'm a girl I still unnecessarily try to flip over things😂just to look cool
That was epic
Plot twist bruh💀
Man walks like bully maguire
👏👏😅😅😅😅🤪
i love his creativity and movements.
Now that, Sir, is commitment!
🤣🤣🤣🤣
He is always cool 💯😲
😂 😂 😂 😂 😂
Amazing lol
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Tbh this is me when I'm high 🤣🤣🤣🤣
When guys try to be Jim carrey
now put music to it
I wonder what his child will think of these videos when grown. Soo hilarious at the end.
Why is it so accurate tho 😭
Genius! The hardest part was probably the fall, not for the mud but for being able to fall flat on his face without flinching or smashing himself up!
😂😂😂😂
That is litterally how I move around my house every day!😂
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😅😅😅😅😅😅😅❤️❤️
In the UK we don’t call it cool, we call it c**t
Luv this dude's Ace Ventura impression! One of em.
😂 the question is how many glass did he break doing that
Ok tbh that was cringe but smooth
I do the jacket thingy but less exaggerated, and no i don't do it to look cool i find it faster and it's less likely to touch the floor that way
🤣🤣🤣🤣this is so true...........that ending tho🤣🤣
Benim başıma gelmişti. Uçağa giderken hemde 😅
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I do have to admit... he's got some moves.
Do it on age’s
Last was epic🥳🥳
Gets whiplash/ snaps neck by acting to cool XD
Works every time for me 😎😁⭐
We’ve all done that with the closet door. 😅
Bro why was that so accurate?!?!
Foi tudo bem, até encontrar uma possa de água kkk
Yeah, the last one was accurate 😂 Once Ive fell on mud while being cool in front of girls and i said this was the part of the game.
😂😂😂😂😂
The end was unexpected 😂😂😂
😂
I seriously feel sorry for ur washing machine  That jacket thing was so cool though
This dude could legit play Michael Jackson with those suave moves. 😎
Funny thing, he does look cool
😁💯
I like the click-click
The epitome of middle school boys. Absolute cringe
you don't have to act like a cool guy you are cool guy 😎
Well he looked cool doing it but in a different way
I always wondered, how you got these  contents......... Each vdio gets more than 2lk likes... Hats off to you man.... And ma favourite is different animals walk, only after seeing your vdio i thought that every one has diff style of walk
Unexpected ending but😂😂😂
Hope there was no animal poop in that mud
Let's take a moment to think how much he cares about these videos, he even falls in puddles for them, I could never do that.
Nice house. How do they afford that? They're so young..

The ending is perfect!!
Me in 8th grade
I think I was about 7 or 8 years old when the "little" teacher (the younger woman in training) asked me (in secret) to to play a role in front of the class All I had to do was when she asked for a plate I go to the canteen get one and on my way back as I enter the classroom I had to drop it and break it I was full on I think I even fell as well And was acting sad but many of my classmates sussed what it was (All in order so we can talk about grammar and similar words based on the situation..) Watching this video made me think that technically that was my first "role" being a kind of "physical entertainer" I know it's a bit far fetched but makes me laugh This channel is amazing I'd love to do that too Who wouldn't ❤️
He after hitting 1 million subscribers
True
Dying
Is that blue shirt of famous astronaut, doctor , police , fireman and pizza guy johhny sins
He doesn’t need to be cool, he’s already cool 😎
Definitely me trying too hard lol
I wouldn’t kick him out of bed.
Tbh, really liked the way he opened the closet door, that was actually kinda cool 😎
Did- did he just drink ice???
I loved the end 😂😂🤣 now please show us the making of,  how often you fell into this puddle to be cool enough 😂
😂😂😂
Pov: me using the knife to open nutella
This is me at school
Ok that last part,  was so hilarious 😂😂
👍
Me, when I try to impress a hot guy....
This is Michael Jackson's son
This is just me when I have a day off work
I hate these videos
my brother is EXACTLY like that, should i kill him?
The ending 🤣🤚💀
I swear this guy is a living looney toon
you‘re so cool
This is my teen son 🤣
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 you are cool guy indeed
😂 thats all i can say
Lmfao 😂🤣
Literally every 4th grader:
Accurate.
Dude has gat lots of energy
I know this one kid that was trying to be cool and he was so cool in fact he said he had a minigun and tommorow he brought a drying rack to school
Hahahahaha great finale
Its meee!!
Lol love it xD
Final perfect !!!!
This is me in a nutshell
Daaaang it
Can we just acknowledge he fell in the puddle for likes and subscribers.
That's pretty cool of you.
A master in body language
When your crush is within a 300 meter radius of you
Isn't this like this guy always is?
Okay his is the coolest guy on earth!
I love that he has skills
The happy end...😁
He just needed to drink out of a plastic bottle throw it behind his back to land perfectly on the counter.
You are the best
Leaving all the doors open is a cool thing 😆
Wow he really tripped in a pile of mid just for the video dang huge respect man.
Or when a guy doesn't even try he just is
What is your height?
I thought he was gonna drop the cup he got me scared 💀
You forgot to close the closet door - ever do coolly...
POV: every Hollywood so called star
This is me when I think that my crush is watching me
You breaked a cup or two trying this shot didn't you?
The end was so good 🤣
Wow this guy's so cool
This is so cringy
The last scene is OOF
Looks more like he's trying to be Michael jackson
And now, my favorite statement, if you act cool, you aren’t cool
My guy auctually looks pretty DOPE 🔥
I relatera so much to trying to be cool by flipping things and reaching behind the back! Also props for throwing yourself in a puddle, this man has no limits!
All the coolness goes to the gutter in the end
The only way to be cool is to be yourself.
Nice try buddy!
Lol it was like bts
God loves you guys!
😂😂so relatable 👍🏻👍🏻
When your crush is watching
My friend: Look your crush coming. Act normal  Me acting normal:
I have to say, you ARE cool!  Most guys would trip over their own feet, drop and break the glass, and fall down the stairs!  Great job, just hope those sunglasses survived...they're pretty nice!
I feel like this is a personal attack  But I'm too cool to care 😎
Iske Ghar ka naksha yaad ho gya mujhe
Yes, he broke two glasses...
he didnt throw the glass not cool
😂😂😂
🤣🤣🤣
Things Daniel did before having a wife
Is this Johnny Bravo?? 😂😂😂
You trying toooooo hard
😂😂
Try to hard and it becomes a TikTok cringe skit XD
Kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk muito bom 👍
He makes every videos me to laugh 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
That last scene though.. rip
And the ending is why I've subscribed to you 😂
Cool guys are very cringe
Hey Daniel labella you are acting like Daniel Radcliffe keep it up bro.will meet up with success one day 👍
Literally me for no reason at home:
Shoulda broke the glass
Ooooooo.... he’s dancing 🕺
Part 2 please 😂😂😂😂😂
every "popular" kid in the 4th grade:
The ending earned my like lol 😂
hi tao ka pa ba?
This is literally my obnoxious pretentious absurd brother when he was younger lol...
You great 👍
I had a guy in class like this wasn’t as bad but it was clear he was an attention seeker, long story short he messed with the wrong person and proceeded to get the ish kick out of him, (said he could beet anyone in a fight as he, quote “was just to good at fighting“) he threw one terrible punch that a baby could do better, got flattened in a single punch and started balling. He moved schools the next year. Kid that won go a weeks suspension but our eternal respect
You seem like those 9 year old skinny white boy characters in movies that do that and walk to school but dirty due to puddles
I know several who act like that...and secretly I wish each had that exact fall.!!  Lol.
😂😂😂
His dedication towards making videos perfect is oustanding
The glasses says 'Cool'
How many glasses did he break
Is there actually a video where he doesn't wear a t-shirt?
Y’all ever just act cool at home to boost your own ego, not to “impress” others?
I just discovered you man!! 😅 awesome videos. you're super talented 😅💓
This is me everyday :)
That's all 😅🤕
The ending 😂
He's so funny
😂😂 reminded me of the mask……😏
R. I. P clothes💀
Couldn’t agree more.
That moves are pretty smooth ngl.
How many times has he fell hurt himself and got dirty just for us? Give this man a oscar
Imagine in a million years this is the only evidence of human existence with no context
Dude fell in mud for views 🤣
This is the best definition of freshmen I have ever seen 😂
Love the ending
I laughed so hard at the last part 😂😂😂
there was this guy at school like that and i could not stand him...he used to ask me how come i was the only one not to like him and he seemed really annoyed by that jajaja what a weirdo😂
Wuts funny as I do this stuff either out of laziness or just complete ADHD
I like his style
I'm pretty sure he's imitating Johnny Bravo?(early 2000s cartoon) lol that slip in the mud.
hopefully he didnt get any mud in his eyes...
Cool guy:falls  Also cool guy: starts doing push ups
Why just why is this my brother like all the time!!
Guys in front of crushes be like:
Oh man, you do the cringe so accurately
Ok ok, I get that the point is they're trying too hard, but some of those moves, especially opening the closest for your jacket was pretty slick.
He is actually looking cooool
🤣🤣
Fun Fact: You will read this entire comment because it started with “fun fact”
The last moment 😂😂
So coool.... And the clymax was interesting 😂😂🤣🤣 nice vid
How can you just ruin clothes like that¿? I don't care that I'm the adult and I can use the washing machine whenever I want but I'm not going to faceplant in a mud puddle in such a nice jacket.    LoL    😂
lol 😂
This guy went full Michal Jackson mode
Bully maguire right there
It's so cringy and you did it so good! How are you always so accurate?
Every time I start thinking I'm all that I bump into a door knob or something.  So I can relate.
MICHEAL JACSON LIKE DANCIN !!!
The coolest guy I ever seen !
If I saw someone acting like that I think what an asshole.
U really fell into that for vdo😂 True dedication
Sad thing is, I actually had a girl tell me I'm lame while her "cool" friend acted like that lmao
Hahahahhahahhahahhaha  HHHAAAAA ahhahahahhah  Teh ending
He made a nice beat when he was getting his coat
That haaa song 🤣🤣
commitment
Literally my brother does this all the time at home 🤣
Chki masi
The last… the last act !~🤣🤣😂😭
Whyy did you do that🤯🤯
He is just showing us how to be too cool 😎
Go Try Play Our First Ever Mario Game Mario 64
Was expecting him to start moonwalking lol 😅
I did all of this when I was 10 lol
I’m watched this so many time just to learn how he did that slidey maneuver thing when he was getting his coat
I look for Daniel laB..., whenever I wanna laught.
Hey, he fell for us .... . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . But in the mud... So sad 🥺
🤣
TOTALLY cool
New title: Every middle school boy around his crush
POV: ur all the middle school guys 🤣
I literally had to repeatedly tell myself he’s just acting so I didn’t die of cringe 😂
The thing is he's already cool
This is cool tho
Most heroes in Indian movies
That’s me… 😳
I'm surprised how he didn't drop that glass...
This man gets all of the maidens
He remembers me of Jim Carry 😂
Feels like u have a crush
I’m cracking up my child in dying and coughing on her food(tryna help her:,)
Anybody who legit thinks this stuff is cool needs to get out of their high school drama
Lol 😂
Hahahahhahaha :D  *like*

He didn’t even lock the door     Or did he lock the door

Omg the last part was hilarious 😂
The Bully Maguire music is playing in my head while I watch this 😆
What was the cleaning bill?
He sooo reminds me of 2010-2011 Justin Bieber in the first few seconds 🤣🤣😅
How can this be equally intensely cringy and funny 😂😂
The last part is the only thing that happens when I try to be cool 😅
Daniel you are just amazing. I can't tell how much I like your videos.
When guy in the ad wears the company's shoes.

Brother looking like a sims character

Best video in this channel you should make more videos on that topic ....
I'm jealous of his glasses
Даже при падении в лужу, нужно оставаться крутым до конца: встал, отряхнулся и пошёл дальше, как ни в чём не бывало. :)
This was what Peter Parker from Spider-Man 3 aspires to be.
the camera: bro wtf
Why do you always bear the same clothes
Just some normal dudes at school
THE MILLION DOLLAR QUESTION: Will you go to Heaven when you die? Have you lied, stolen, used God’s name in vain, lusted (Which Jesus said was adultery in Mt. 5-28)? If so, God sees you as a liar, thief, blasphemer, and adulterer at heart. If you die in your sins you will end up in a terrible place called Hell. But there’s good news, Though we broke God’s law, Jesus paid the fine by dying on the cross. “God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes (trusts) in Him should not perish but have everlasting life” (Jn. 3-16). Then Jesus rose from the dead and was seen by hundreds of eyewitnesses.  if you’ve made it this far, please, repent and trust in Jesus and what he did for you on the cross. You have a promise from the God who cannot lie that he will forgive every sin you’ve committed or ever will commit and grant you everlasting life as a free gift.
LOL the last part tho where he falls is a ✨MASTERPIECE ✨
Why this remind me of Tom cruise
Üfff erkek yağğğğ

Todos los morros de mi secundaria ser como:
Only tryhard bro)))) like from ukraine
pretty impressive that he would allow himself to smack his whole body into mud
This man looks like he's ready to meet his new girlfriend that really pretty then slips and falls
Am I the only one who got triggered at the fact he didn't close the cabinet door?
He did it for us 🥰
My question is... you're already handsome, BUT WHY CHOOSE THAT MUDDY ROAD?! 😤
I do all of this but I promise it's because I get bored and not because I want to look cool
Basically everyone at my school
That footwork is hilarious 😂
Every jock character who bullies the protag in teen movies.
the ending make me die laughing
This is so funny 😂😂😂
This is quite casual actually
Let us all appreciate him cuz he fell in that big stinky muddy puddle !!!! JUST TO MAKE US LAUGH !?  THank you !
That was mentioned in Quran ولا تصعر خدك للناس ولا تمش في الأرض مرحا إن الله لا يحب كل مختال فخور
When girls tries to be cool:  Girl: *moves*  Guy: ☺️
The opening of the door gets me
Why do i actually think that he looks awesome?!? XD

You don't need any laughing wala background music to make people laugh.
I think the worst part about this is that it’s in movies all the time
everyone: talking about stuff I tbh don’t know about  Me: *thinking did he trip on accident or on purpose*
Spiderman dance scene be like

Falling in that mud was not cool it was embarrassing. That jacket flipping was pretty cool
I had a dude in my class, and whenever he would fall, he would just start doing push-ups 😂

Charlie Chaplin

My friend :- "your crush is watching you, please try be normal and calm" Me:-

Not cool but a jerk
Whats the clicking and dancing for ? Is that wat americans find kl
Kinda reminds me of Andrew Dice Clay
Never expected ending... 😂
The ending tho🤣😂😂
It is literally me..but in a small amount😂
😎😎
Respect You fell into an dug pit intentionally just for a video ...... 🔥🔥
You remind me of Justin Bieber after releasing his album of Boyfriend
Swagger of some guy named Dan
I know a guy who does this exact same thing and it drives me insane
I like how he's just pop locking everywhere 😂😂
😂
the fact that he doesn't close anything that he opens... that goes so well with the character
😂😂😂
Dedication: he actually gave a hug to mud..
This guy legitimately has puppy eyes
That is sooooo me
Me realizing I try too hard to look cool😶
I want to fall in a puddle
WHAT IS THIS YOU IS NOT YOU ARE  THE MOST IMPORTANTLY
All the coolness only to be defeated by the mud 😂🤣

This guy is hilarious!
The end WASTED
Lmao.. So true.
Last part 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Salt Bae🤣
I misread the title as "middle school boys" and didn't notice anything wrong with it until I tried to send it to a friend.
"Training center for silly walks" in general all these do fall under the neurological term "sensorimotor disorder"
High School Musical cuts that didn't make the movies.
That build-up to the payoff was great
This is just embarrassing
This is a perfect recreation of my friend
😂😂😂
Haha. I mean, he's not wrong
🤣🤣🤣🙏🙏🙏❤❤❤
You are a cool dude...😎😎😎
The cool Guy doesn't close the door Correctly
😅...that's what I needed now, thx..well done👍🏻!!
Well you don't have to try to be cool because you are already cool👊👊👊👊
Neighbours :Deniel drunk again😜😜
A day in the life of 11 year old me.

Axaxaxa 😁🤣
There is no way to look cool you just look like an idiot trying to act cool
HAHAH
À force de devenir cool, on finit toujours dans la boue.

Roliing on floor Laughing
I thought guys only behave like this in movies😂

In India, we have a common word for those guy whose tries to act like this and we call them ch*t*ya

Oooohhh the cool guy got dumped into a mud puddle 🤣 I thought he would do a long jump and get caught in the middle 🥴
😄😄
Asslam u alykum .. How are you all? Please I request it that everyone should recite your holly book with meanings not even in Islam otherwise you belongs to Christian , Hinduism , Buddhism religion etc no issue ..but at least recite your holy book , in these books some things are similar in every religion that GOD  is one and show that the HAZRAT MUHAMMAD (peace be upon him) comes as a last messenger and idol worship is prohibited in yajurved and in bible and  in others religious books ... May be there is some differences but these main things are similar .. So don't we have to follow that at least ? Please concentrate it THANK YOU 🙂
Remind me of Deadpool 😂😂❤️
😂😂😂 look to the end it so funny 🤣🤣
I think a person who has bright skin and sharp nose is amazing to wear sunglasses
Lol at the part when he drinks the water he looks like an npc
Bro look like Max from a Goofy movie
The end though lol
Super❣️
The fact that he spilled water on his shirt when drinking and walked away like nothing happened made even more funny🤣
How many takes did each scene require? And how many glasses got smashed as a result?
He is gonna be like Rithik Roshan.

THE SHIMMY WALK

When he left his house  After sometime Thief: acting cool and stealing everything 😎
He’s so dang good at this 😂
Dan: casually wears a jacket      Me : EREN YEAAAAAAAAAAAGERRRRRRRRR
This is true because some times my brother does this for no reason
You wanna hear something sad?         I've seen 30 year olds acting like this
other than the steps walking this was PERFECT
Everything changes when he drops the glass and it breaks. But mom is there.
And you daydream that someone is watching you😁
There was a guy in my class who actually do like this in order to make girls being impressed...😂
Everybody talking about the vid:  Me: How is he so smooth🤯🤯!!! He must be a smooth crime 😎😎😎
Me : Are u Michael Jackson
This is what everyone sees when your listening to music and feel badass
This is so smooth 👍
You need not try Daniel, we know you are cool.
It makes me mad.
Been there,done that
That Jacket move was pretty cool imo
Family: goes to my funeral  Mom: that's why I've always said that YouTube is bad Dad: he just watched a youtube video Mom:that's why
Omg the end hahahaha poor Daniel!! 😂😂 Such a sacrifice
It just gets dumb at this point XD🤣
I 😂😂😂 so hard at the end
No way you don't put a smile on my face every time I watch you! 👍👍
" I tried so hard And got so far, But in the end It doesn't even matter... " Perfectly fits here🤣  Thanx for 1.4K+ likes, this is literally my first time!  Wow, the likes r increasing quite fast!

Plot twist he actually is cool
Some parts are not even acting, I've seen guys actually act like this
I watched this about 9 times and im still laughing
😁
This is so true
The walk lmao
That man is cool if he has enough trust in his own body to catch glass and then not clutch it so tight that you might break it.
this is high level cringe      IM NOT HATING OB HIM THE WAY HE ACTED WAS CRINGE IT WAS FUNNY AND CRINGE
I act like this alone when I’m in a good mood

0:27 that was actually so fucking cool
0:38 He didn't even close the door properly. 😅
Lol dude I loved this man's things dude
cringeeee
I asked my brothers bestfriend why guys all act like this. And I show him this video and he told me because that's how they make girls/guys laugh. And I'm just like "👁👄👁 the more you know?"
The only thing not cool is him not closing any door.
Actually you look very cool
Me high af:
Let’s respect that he goes where none of us would go to entertain people.
Ngl I do these things infront of my crush

“Roses are red” “Violets are blue” “If It’s less than a minute” “I’ll give it a view”
Walking in home in shoes
Plot twist
Loved the way he opened that door, at first I thought he was gonna square up with the wall ⬛ 👆🏼  The end was unpredictable
He’s not cool he’s awesome 😎
Me infront of my crush :
Me on a daily basis
When I saw girl
When i say girl
0:42 in the name of content i'll do everything
I just sing a song out loud and people look at me
How many tries did it take for you to catch the glass and not smash it.
You know if this guy had neighbours I can only imagine what is going on in their heads when looking out the window every day.
He was so focused on looking cool that he almost forgot to shut his door 😂😂
Facts no cap
Plz make video about  when man or boys  try to show his fake attitude towards people
Is it me or did everyone's sleeve felt uncomfortable when Dan put on his coat
He really did that..... I-
Not even gonna lie, some of those moves were pretty smooth
Me whenever I have a good mood:
in the inflght entertainment was offered "just 4 laughs" which did not depend from any language some years ago
How come you never talk in videos?
Chad
Sorry cant stop laughing at the 1st part😂😂
He smooth doe
Justin Timberlake be like...
GTA but it's a daily basis 👀
He got the mooves tho
This is just how I naturally am. I don’t even try bro
*Him exits his house* Neighborhood: "oh look, there goes the creepy guy"
When he's trying to be cool an ended up being cringeworthy
Well I can relate it with myself
Gotta appreciate the fact that he sacrificed his drip and a lot of other things outside of this video just for entertainment
He never disappoints us,!,
When cool is fool.
Hritik Roshan wow...😮
At least someone finally agrees with me these straight men are such tryhards on trying to be cool.
This is my 8 year old little brother after him watching Dude Perfect for a month!😂😂😂
Maybe you😂😂😂😂
POV: Your home is tiny in the mud.
This is how I walk around my house when I’m alone
I think I act cool. *What it looks like:*
Did he fall in the mud on purpose or on accident?
Speech 100
Last seen amazing 🥺😂
The cameraman is sure his girlfriend.
True
If someone walks into my house like this im calling the cops
I do such things when I'm happy or for fun, not when I try to be cool, but nice shmoovez man
Michael Jackson out here
The way he walks 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I would love to see this guy out In public
Every teenager in a nutshell
These are so raw, no corny music or intros. Not much talking. Just simple funny videos. None of the extra unnecessary stuff. Love these.
ah *michal jackson music*
That's how my music teacher acts
Alternate title: what my whole family sees when my cousin says he can dance like Michael Jackson really well.
At that moment when you trying to be cool something bad always happens.
Alt title - When someone goes drunk

My brother:
Alternate title: when guys try to impress their crush.
POV: Your parents crush are actually best friends and they will come to your house and your crush is coming too    You:

😂😂😂
Is it just me or does this remind of that scene from spiderman 3 (2007)
So true
I think you know us better than we know ourselves 😂
If you wanna be cool, simply be itachi in naruto lmao.
And what if there comes an blooper
The title should be : when a high schooler see his crush
What about video on same topic for girls ?
I almost done everything🤣
Man took a bullet
i turned this all the way up because i couldn’t hear and than next thing my mom wakes up and yells at me 🤣
As a cool guy i can confirm that he‘s cool.
LITERALLY every teenage boy in existence
Masterclass bro😁  I don't even imagine the number of tries to record this video
Nice expression
Lol
Tge ending was fantastic
I don't understand why some hoomans would do unnecessary things like this guy 😂😂

“Uh oh I forgot to record you falling in the mud! Guess you have to do it *again*
I'm pretty sure this is just how 10 year olds act when moms not at home
That ahhhh after drinking 😂
Johnny cage?
Do people actually do that?
you are really cool man😎😂😂
😂😂😂
The fall 😂
Goddamn he's absolutely gorgeous 😍😋

That faceplant just makes my day-
This is what my brother does all the time
The mud got me
HE failed to look not cool. HE was cool actually
The last scene made me jump.. lol🤣😂
I love this guy
When he wants to act cool but then fall into the mud
ARE YOU A DANCER?

That is just silly
Oh my god , literally jumped on the mud 😳

Cool checklist: 1. Wear sunglasses 2. Lean your shoulders back at least 80% of the time 3. Casually dance whenever possible 4. Flip objects and catch them for no reason 5. Frown and raise your eyebrows
people who have disliked the vid probably love falling and bathing in the muddy puddles :D

When he actually looks cool:

He’s actually pretty good at being cool.
This is cool at so many levels
Definitely my brother it is just he doesn’t know how to act cool so he ends up acting stupid.

Every time I watch these it makes my day
Nobody 5 yr old me:

In every school we have that kid but in my school every school boy is that kid
All the boys at my middle school literally no joke 😂😂😳
I wonder if he ever messed up the glass flip and how many times
i can say from 0:01 that he's anoying af 😂
The closest scene reminded me one of Michael Jackson's songs.🤣 Yeah when he fell, that was THE COOLEST  PART cause NOBODY falls that GRACEFULLY!😱😂
I wish I'm cool just like this guy😕
Is this shot on iphone?
guys 24/7
I hate that I do some of these things when no one is watching
This gives me Jim Carrey vibes
"When guys try too hard to be cool" Me: *... AND MISERABLY FAIL...*
Me in my house when no one is home and feeling so responsible:
That’s me everyday😂
That's so correct
This must of been so hard to make
I literally do that cup throw catch and this one time it I didn't catch it and also it wasn't glass.
luke from jessie is that you?
Exactly what I hate about guys 😂
And he is leaving everything open
He just left the cabinet open
Anyone felt anxious when he flipped the cup? No one? Just me?
I literally had a classmate just like this and I could tell he genuinely thought he was the coolest guy in the world... everytime I saw him I wanted to punch him in the face and give him a grip of reality
😂😂😂
Is he from the 50’s?
That's not cool,that's annoying
Cool jacket, and tho by the way u should act, it real good, u know

Not easy being cheesy
When you solve the last maths problem of the exercise
A few months ago, someone acted like this and tried to open a bottle of lemonade-syrup (or soda-syrup or whatever you call it in your country, reader) Either way, the plastic had not been properly separated, so it was literally (still) melted shut. He tried opening it and failed. I tried opening it too, but failed, there was not even óne of the "thingies" in between that was broken. He then tried again (still didn't work) and when I asked for it back, he said; 'Ugh ahah, no, you're a girl, you can't do that." It was a joke of some sort but it triggered a reflex and before I knew it, the whole canteen was chanting and I was trying to open the bottle and break the plastic thingies. And after 30-50 seconds, I finally did. And everyone burst into loud cheering.  And the guy was really grumpy and took the bottle back. I said; 'It's alright, next time you get to open one again' but his whole image was ruined. Oh well.
Last one was Good😅😅
0:42    I feel so bad :(

0:28
this is actually me when I see my crush ngl
Lol😁😁😁 not gonna lie that's true with some folk
Me every time I see a girl 0:42
To dude's who try to look 'cool' - If a girl likes you because you are 'cool' and how you look they are very very dumb. An intelligent person would like someone for their personality. Also, acting 'cool' makes you look really dumb, as in you failed all your classes and you have an IQ of 80. Just be yourself (and if you arent respectful, honest, or kind ... try to be).
all the 14 year old boys trying to get a girl:
Daniel in almost every video: EVERYBODY DO THE FLOP
Bruh can we acknowledge how smooth he opened that door?
0:40 Fuck we need more people like Daniel😂😂😂😂

A young boy enters a barber shop and the barber whispers to his customer. “This is the dumbest kid in the world. Watch while I prove it you.”  The barber puts a dollar bill in one hand and two quarters in the other, then calls the boy over and asks, “Which do you want, son?”  The boy takes the quarters and leaves. “What did I tell you?” said the barber. “That kid never learns!”  Later, when the customer leaves, he sees the same young boy coming out of the ice cream store. “Hey, son! May I ask you a question? Why did you take the quarters instead of the dollar bill?”  The boy licked his cone and replied, “Because the day I take the dollar, the game is over!”   Hit Subscribe button 💓 if you like or i will eat your all food

That one sixth grader named tyler:

This acting remind me of *LOGAN PAUL*
LOL THE LAST PART THO-
I feel bad for him when he fell in the mud
0:05 my man sounded like a Nintendo switch
Being cool= doing everything while dancing 😂

Tate: The Stupid wannabe cool guy. This video=Tate.

The ending of GOLD
True  but is that jacket part of the act or is it just a jacket to show how they try to be cool putting on a jacket because I have a jacket like that and really hope that that kind of jacket doesn’t show that someone is trying to be cool
One boy in my class:
This is like that cool version of myself that I imagine when I’m happy
This guy's got some moves!!
You at home, when you top an exam.
Jokes aside this guys is actually insanely talented at... well... everything. He can flip a fucking sofa, jump over an armchair, lift a human being with ease, run with actual speed, act like an Oscar winner and is also brave enough to ruin his house, clothes, shoes and windows (and probably his knees too) just for these videos. A true legend.
The 904 people that disliked the video are the people that try to hard to be cool
I don't play with the jacket flip
My 6 year old brother be like

0:09 to 0:11  *Me not being able to throw and catch a orange* •́  ‿ ,•̀
If anyone dislikes because it’s cringe it’s supposed to be like that.
Guy: I am cool! The muddy and wet floor:              I'm about to end this man's whole career.
POV: You saw one of his videos in the recommended tab, and now can't stop watching his videos.
*One way to creep your crush out.*
So true
After all that coolness.... face fall into a puddle :>
That hyaaaaa sound after drinking water always satisfying 😂😂
THIS IS LITERALLY THE DEFINITION OF MY 5 YEAR OLD BROTHER
*He fell into a muddy puddle for us* *Remember That*
And this, my friends, is why I'm a lesbian.
The key to being cool is to try to not act cool :D  -someone out there idk
Plot twist: this is him showing how cool he is
HAAAHAH
Me : *see the title* Also me : yup and sometimes ppl like that its annoying
0:41

He is supre cool

Who’s watching this @ 11:17 eastern time? I see comments from like 6 minutes ago 💆🏻‍♀️
if you have the balls to flip a glass cup over a wooden floor and not break it, you're a little cool
That’s soooo me sometimes especially when I’m by myself

That dude is so cool

You don't have to try to be cool cause you already are

Everyone’s talking about how he didn’t close the door. But the door closed itself, so-
Now put Peter Parker’s dance soundtrack

His face look like jim carrey❤️
0:42 Satisfying
Ads be like
You'll be the next jim carrey
Cool guy be like  Lol he fell over

Charlie Chaplin of 20th century 😂
All jokes aside , think he actually fell in to the dirt  just for a video.
Bruh why is that so accurate?!
Pls don't attack me like this🙏
This is me😂😂😂😂😂
he turned tiktoks to videos
What's wrong with this video?:  *I'm on this video and I don't like it
So true
Nobody: Young Bieber at his home before he was picked by Braun:
Is it weird that this is how all the dudes act in my school.
Brilliant! It reminds me of Justin beiber
Thats basically Bollywood
This one has the absolute best ending out of them all! 🤣
Saludos desde Chile

My friends relate to this
thats my dad right there
0:18  Aaaaahhhh
You look like the guy that is my classmates i have a classmate that looks almost like you
When you failed in exam but your best friend friend passed it with first class.
Clearly, a man drinking water doesn't look cool.
It would be cool when he threw the jacket and wear it in mid air
Tha end HAHAHAHA
The popular kid in Disney movies be like:
IDK why? But He looks like the nerd who bullies every one in the school
0:41 When you try to act cool in front of your crush but the pressure gets to you.
0:42
He's actually cool
*Tom Cruise*
JESUS CHRIST LOVES US ALL AND WANTS TO SAVE US FROM ETERNAL TORMENT.BELIEVE JESUS CHRIST DIED ON THE CROSS FOR OUR SINS AND THAT HE ROSE AFTER 3 DAYS AND WON OVER DEATH SO THAT WE MIGHT BE SAVED THROUGH HIS RESSURECTION.  BROTHER And SISTERS  BELIEVE ME PLEASE.MAY THE FATHER ALMIGHTY. BLESS US. READ THIS ALL OF YOU. To all my Catholic Friends. Today is the day that Mary passes in front of you. For those who believe in the power of prayer! Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee, blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus! Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners, now at the hour of our death, Amen! (Make your special request). Please don't break this novena. You just have to copy and paste on your wall. It is not to share. Dear sweet mother of God, please pray for all mankind that we would see peace on earth 🌎 ❤🙏 and put an end to this Corona virus. Amen! MAY THE ALMIGHTY FATHER  BLESS US ALL AND OUR SOULS
Let us Pray🙏 Heavenly Father, today we kneel in prayer, asking for the recovery of all patients with Covid 19 and asking our Father Almighty for protection for those who are well. Please shield us, Oh Lord, for YOU alone can heal the inflicted and give protection to those who are well and to all front liners.... in Jesus mighty name we pray.  Amen.🙏📿💒  I request my friends to put this message in your status, Let's do a prayer brigade.  God bless us all.🕊❤️  #FightingTCPS #TheToughest #WeHealAsOne 🙏🙏🙏
The government might be preparing for a cashless society, but it was predated by the Bible. Already designed! If put into place, it just means our time is getting closer. Not worried about what is going to happen...just looking up and getting ready. Maybe worry about your friends and family who aren't ready instead of COVID and what is already designed to happen that you will not be stopping. While the devil is preparing people for the Anti-Christ, God is preparing people for the Rapture. I don’t know when the rapture will take place, but I do believe it could be soon. I also believe this is a time that God is giving us a chance to repent. We need to get the Gospel message out!!! Until the Good Lord calls me away from this world to go home, I want to make it clear that I believe in Jesus Christ as the True Lord and Savior. Despite the fact that I am human, and I fail a lot, I believe that Jesus is the Son of God. I believe that He died on the cross as a sacrifice for our sins and that He rose from the dead on the third day. He loves us all dearly (far more than we deserve) and forgives our sins when we repent.   Like in the time of Noah, when people ridiculed him of the upcoming storm. Not knowing it will be their final day, so will the coming of Christ be, it will be unexpected.   His Word says:  John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  Matthew 10:33 But whosoever
That last one was unexpected 😂
U haven't seen Rajini style
I wonder how many glass he had broken
#physical comedy
9 year olds when they see girls that they like:  Edit: nice this comment has officialy started ww3, just like EVERY SINGLE ONE OF MY COMMENTS GEEZ.
0:42
I'd disable comments..... 🙄
Is this what happens in high school?
A lot of guys on the internet act like this. They think they're cool or sexy. When I watch. It's basically, "Man this guy is fucking cringey".
This is basically the Peter Parker dancing scene in spider man 3
Now guys know to slam into a puddle to pick up chicks
Two minutes silence for the last ending 🤐🤐😄
Ryan Reynolds with more Aderline
Watching this gives me pain
Not gonna lie, this video is pretty...cool 😎
Did you take videos of my highschool?
See also: *John Trevolta*
To be honest I try a little to hard to be cool              Ok fine I 100% try to hard
Can we all just appreciate how he frickin fell face first into mud on purpose for a video like
So yo have met my dad.....
I laughed the whole way through this it is soooo accurate, they just look ridiculous and make fools of themselves lol
What shoes is he wearing here?
Face down in the dirty water🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
😂😂👍
I could already see how cool this video will be...
0:21 The water stain on his shirt. 😂
How about next time you get a board that can handle the Neutron style? Later Nickorama!
If I could put a jacket on like that I would wear it no matter how hot it was
Me when I listen to fall out boy
Tiktokers be like
Im scared every single frame of thia was me...specially the last ones.
Anyone else get Zac Efron vibes from this
0:42 man i lost it 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Bully Magiure in black Suit!
if this is how people get girls i feel sorry for the femals that have to deal with that devil
Alternative title: Bollywood Movies.
yes.
I just imagine that he drops the cup then someone saw him😂😂
Lol
StArLoRd???
This is me when working at the store
While watching 0:28 my eyebrows just went up and came back down
Well the last part was way cool
This is pretty kool tbh.
Daniel: Behaves cool Me: Shows this video to my mom  My mom: He did not close a door and THAT IS NOT COOL.
0:29 was actually cool
Does YT even pay this guy? YT are putting ads to his videos
Yooo J.B. (2013) what's up
The twist ending though....
Man you should be like the next Tom Cruise
is he really acting?
Do some Johnny Bravo act
0:41 in 0.25x speed, playing it off cool like it was part of the plan😂.
If you are cool you don´t have to act cool. At the end of this video you se the result of acting too hard.
This is how to look extremely awkward XDD
Poor guy. He literally slammed himself into a puddle for content.
This needs music
I can’t lie I do the same thing in real life at school lol
I'm cool...2 hours later walking...oof 😂
Not gonna lie I gasped at the end... That acting skills tho 👌🏻
This was unlimited cringe but ok...
the last one hhehe
Low key nailed this video!
I love the end xD
Wow I wish I could be that cool
Any one else singing you tried so hard but in the end it didn’t even matter- no ok .-.
This is me when I am alone in the house😂
His swag is so loud he cant hear me lol :D
This reminds me of Bully Maguire
Fantastic
Ummm,...that was actually really cool, except the walking part.
Who else died laughing when he fell in that big puddle
Why would a cool guy walk near muddy waters?
Dislikes are from people who are not cool
0:41 looks realistic
I teach middle and high school. He is not wrong. In fact, he was so on point the whole time, I was actually annoyed. And then he face planted into the middy puddle, and I was happy.
I wonder when sharp, sudden movements became able to be considered "cool".
0:42 just pause and look at his face hes not even scared he just belly flopped straight onto the mud on hard ground lol
*guy
THATS EXACTLY LIKE THAT ONE GIY IN MY CLASS!
The fact that the camera shook from the  cabinet being thrown open just makes this even better.
I've been insulted
I won't say my age but I'm a teenager- And I can say I am REALLY not like that But I saw some boys acting this sort of way
My friend acts like this
00:27 I wouldn't mind opening doors that way! 😅
Imma a guy and I can confirm everything about this but you missed one thing
This reminds me of that part where peter (spider-man) dances in public
Every one is in style till the mud appears 😎
Yea that’s me kinda but I’m not cool so I give up on trying
This guy is probably a dancer
Oh my goodness......it is true that you are the most powerful or you can say careless(in a good sense)...like you don't give anyone and anything a shit..you say its your life...so your choice...so CHILL😎🤘
This is actually gays
Spiderman 3 vibes
0:10 I wonder how many cups he broke to do that
How i be cool: show up to a car show in a JDM Chaser
Me watching: haha!  Me watching the end: ..O.O OMG LMAO HAHAHA😂😂😂
Looks like Mark Wahlberg
this reminds me of that one spider-man scene
So, how many times did you drop the cup while trying to flip it?
Alternative title: the cool guy in movies
The last moment tho- QwQ
Hes just vibing to some good music
Alternative title: being like johnny bravo
Story of my life
0:42 He sacrificed his clothes for the good of it
Omg that whole ending 😂😂🤣🤣🤣
99 percent of kids now flex off the stuff their mom gets them
I wonder what his neighbors thinks of him.
The things this guy does for a video
Who randomly got him on suggested and has been cracking up to him ever since  Edit: thanks for the likes I would love it if u would subscribe
Don't act cool....                Because you r cool already 😌😌❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
This just reminds me of my teacher
Some guys try to do this at my school pre-COVID and it would annoy me so much and I wanted to yell at them to stop lol
0:27 When I need to go pee.
*welcome o downtown coolsville*
0:42 lol
If I were doing this my mom and dad would be concerned
Cringe
i guess this video inspires me to be more cool
The endings never disappoint me :D
0:40 Me walking on grass and i trip
Me be like:
I feel like I can relate to some of this
This guy who is acting cool is me 1 year ago.
Your handsome man
Excuse me, Jim Carrey, you left the cabinet door open.
0:28 was the funniest scene
HE LITERALLY ENDED UP IN MUDDY WATER FOR THIS I-
The ending tho😂
Me falling while walking to school: 0:42   My friends walking to school: 0:38           The bullies:                i ⊂_ヽ      ＼＼   Am          ＼( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)               >    ⌒ヽ             /      へ＼          /        /    ＼＼cool          ﾚ    ノ         ヽ_つ         /    /      /    /|     (    (ヽ     |    |、＼     | 丿 ＼ ⌒)     | |        ) / ノ )        Lﾉ (_／   The baby's that haunt me:                          ⠀                          ∩                              ＼＼                             ／     ）h i ⊂＼＿／￣￣￣     ／     ＼＿／   ° ͜ʖ ° （             ）             ／⌒＼         ／     ＿＿＿／⌒＼⊃     （     ／         ＼＼            U
All I see is him doing usual trying to hard
He is soo cool he is dumb
This video should be titled If My Crush Watched Me 24/7
Poor kid he fell
This is me listening to music
creng
😅😅😅😅😅😅
That Nagarpalika moment though...
So true in the end, you end looking like a jackass
That fall at the end was too good, I always fall like that
The last one was epic🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
But this is how I normally start my day..
This si basically John Travolta in grease
Nobody       8 year olds:
Just appreciate that at the end he sacrificed his clothes for us
If you want to be cool just get some ice
🤔I wonder how many takes he had to do for each scene🧐
This guy would be a good friend. He would also give great advice
Really loved your content ❤️
My brother try’s REALLY HARD to act cool
When you try to impress your crush by walking like a boss: 0:40
Last scene is the ultimate reason why I don't act cool
0:40
Why is this every guy at my school?!?!
THE END THO!!! <XXDDD
Tobias from the Amazing World of Gumball:
we need to appreciate the fact that he actually fell in the mud just for a youtube video
This is literally how my friends act
Let me take a wild guess...   that last part wasnt planned was it? Lol
He do be fresh doe
Really all I see is a child in a man’s body.
The dudes in grease:
How is this so true
when a guy watches too many 80's movies
Looks like he might have lived with Michael Jackson
F in the chat for his face, and clothes that he sacrificed to that mud....
0:28
Looking that really he was hurt after falling down just to film this video, no-one really cared
Adorable if you do it to make me laugh.. I'd melt hahah But never act this way constantly guys
Man he is acting so cool right now.   Him: *falls into a puddle*  Me: 👏 way 👏 to 👏 go 👏 buddy 👏
The commitment is just immeasurable.
"I’m from downtown coolsville"
NOO!! YOU RUINED THE JACKET!!!
Swag levels are too high sir! We need to stop him now!!
😅😅😅😅0:43
Fun fact: a “cool boy” is like bad boy
This is pure cringe, but funny
My man here makin fabulous content with a great cost on all his videos- Respect
U good there.... U just fell down in the mud👇😅
I CAN'TT
I want meet you🙏🙏
Jonny Bravo?
That’s finishing he looks like a middle school bully
ngl he got some footwrok moves
XD the last one
The ending is perfect and should happen to all of them 😂
Imagine How many cups hes broken XD
looking like michael jackson
He all out of Alpha moves cause he used them all up...absolute madlad
Im so happy I found ur Channel
THE ENDING LMAOO I CANT STOP LAUGHING
Yo he's got those smooth moves
They dancing around is so accurate 😂 😂
0:04 camera
His favorite thing is falling face down lmao
*How my Uncle acts every time he’s near a group of people:*
Wow that was really cool
My dude really just left with the closet door open bro..
Do more parts of when boys act cool and gils to
My only reaction: 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂     3 hours later: 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
0:41 Poor guy, needed to fall didn't he?
KARMA
Bruh, lol.
This guy is so addictive.
YouTube pays him well bc I wouldn't ruin some new ass Adidas for a laugh
Very true
To be cool in 2020...Be funny. This man has achieved that
That one kid in the 7th grade:
anyone saw the reflection from the glasses B)
This is exacly my friend
The ending.. Was karma for those who try sooooo hard. Got me for sure 👌
iii diedddddd laughingg mennn hahahahahahaha
Basicly that one classmate
I feel like I do this too.
The laast one is funny just ran fail in water
It's like some kind of music video without music
that's literally me when someone isnt watching me. i dont like to act cool in front of others
if your a guy and you want to act cool then just wear high heels while skateboarding,like,doesn't that sound cool?.
You are making very good videos you actually just fell on the water
His walk is everything
This guy's videos are something else. On a different level. Appreciate his creativity and work.
Oh I see! 😀😀😀
this is just me whenever i got music on XD
A very good ending
This guy is great... Esp. if u want a good laugh.
I'd never do that. Looks ultra energy consuming for a lazy sloth like me.
U ruined that jacket for this Fu&_$#ing video......... jacket was awesome I liked that
Nothing just 😂😂😂
I feel like an idiot after watching this coz this is exactly what I do
This goes with staying alive
nobody:   kids at my school: write this down! write this down!
Hi
Is the mud cool hot or yummy tell me some things i need it for a expirement
So this is what Johnny cage has been doing.
So act like Jim Carey? All righty then.
This is a normie life
0:41: Karma after you joke around about someone’s muddy shoes.
I feel like this is how the Cheetos mascot acts
I’m a brand new subscriber and I must say that I’m gonna enjoy my stay
his movement is very similar to ace venturas moves
This is just a video of how normal light skins act
At first I was like no part of any of these actions is cool, but then the whole mood changes when he fell in the mud. It may not be cool, but that was funny
The walk reminds of some of the peds from GTA San Andreas 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Hi
Did u ever go and say    “Man, I wish I wrote that”        :)
Me when my crush walks in class
I can’t get enough of these!    You are so creative.
When ur so cool that you leave every door open:
He’s got some SWAG.
tbh that's just me vibin to my fav music lol
Why did this remind me so much of my dance teacher 😂

0:27 the best move :D
Lol, I think im a guy 😂
The poetic karma at the end cracked me up!
That one kid's dad trying to be hip so the class thinks he's cool
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 how on earth are you coming up with this stuff. I know a guy who comes to get his hair cut where I work and that’s him exactly. We’re always ignoring him because he’s wants attention 😂😂😂😂.
I didn’t know that snapping your finger would make the same sound as you’re teeth
Bloopers please
That's me when no one's around
Patagonia made you this way.
Ace Ventura vibe.
He’s walking like he’s about to join one of the gangs from Michael Jackson’s ‘Beat it’  song music video
TBH that was actually cool
He should’ve started doing push-ups when he fell down at the end 😂
Damn, he just described all the boys in my school
All you need now is the I'm bad (Michael Jackson) music
Nerds at my school be like lol hahaha
This man face planted in mud for us
Me When I Walk To School  0:42
I just wanna ask if this guy never showers or change clothes or have an infinite stock of the same blue top and black pants in his closet and is forced to wear them
Bro he even makes falling cool
I don't think the last clip was scripted
This video hit me harder than my dads belt after finding out I actually do this when I’m home alone
Coolest person I have ever seen!🖤
How in the hell did I just get this notification?
ROFL🤣🤣🤣🤣
Man, he's alot more cool without sunglasses.
My brother always make things like that...
Well thats a perfect acting
That Glass Cup Is Giving me Anxiety
This is y i hate making this no sense moves
request , different type of people typing oh
You just literally fell on a pool of mud to make us happy. 😂
Idk why I'm watching this while imagining mj's beats as bgm 🤣
Sunglasses look good on him
*(cool guy finger snapping)*
Omaygod the ending!! 🤣🤣🤣
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
When when when when
There he go again...
Tobey:  Gonna put some dirt in your eyes.
My EYES! But that ending though.. i bet someone (his neighbors) think this man has too much caffeine
So basically Michael Jackson, but reversed at the end?
CRINGE!     But I guess that’s the point.
The last one got me
Nailed it again!
I felt that ‘Ahhhhh’ in my bones
The end had me crying😭
he literally fell  into it  for this vid eo🙏
I do open doors like that And that’s close to how I put on jackets  I feel called out   You do not open doors like that past me. what the hell are you talking about?
The face plant deserves a triple 👍 like.
Bro this guy would make a great actor
How come every girl within a 1 mile radius falls in love when a cartoon character does this but cringe and look away right after when I do it?
You should make a second channel for bloopers or fails, cause I'm sure there were some making these videos
Tik Tok boys be like
He do be smooth tho
What a chad
Fake: you didn't do push-ups after tripping
Way to accurate 👌😂
Ugh why is he trying to act so cool
The exaggerated swagger of a white male
*that was cool.*
Holy your "cool" movements are so annoying. Great job!
this just reminds me of michael jackson 😭
The things he does for us 🤣🤣🤣🤣    0:39
Am I the only one who does this when they are home alone and in a great mood?
Sometimes I do the cup flip thing when I am bored. But because I am accident prone I only do it with the plastic ones.
OMG THE ENDING CAUGHT ME OFF GUARD 🤣
LMHO
the end tho LOL
I haven't heard this guy talk once
Nah that's just you
XD
7th graders be like:
That almost looks like the moonwalk 😂
Owh... Ending.. 😁
Alternate title: what guys think they look like when they receive a compliment
F in the chat for his perfectly good clothes
My guy didn't even close the door when he left the house.
Lil mosey jealous that he woke up like  the man
Se looks like an animated chracter lool
We respect your sactifice made in this video.
I know this🤣🤣this happens always to me
0:27 nice move
That's how in the 1970's be
Cringe
He did it all wrong. If you want to be very cool, just stuff yourself in a freezer. You’ll be VERY cool.
This guy make use every inch of his house
He didn't fall over by accident, he laid down to do some one arm push-ups. Just like the cool guy he is.
i roasted this man in so many ways
i think the people who disliked are the men who act hard
Really dude? You don't have to make a video about me cringeley trying to impress my crush. Not cool
Fake. This was the audition footage for the popular boy in high school musical.
Thats just me when I have my earbuds in and the song just got really good
Missed opportunity to smack the ceiling as you walk out the door 😂
That one guy in the hallway everyday
The fact that he fell in a puddle for this video
He's so cool.
ok but this a BEAUTIFUL home😻😤
Well literally he did get cool by falling in the puddle.  So +1 skill tree
Nice
The high-school jock be like:
Tru, Tru.
Really
Hate it when guys do this I mean why even try? Why dare? 😂
oh my gosh 😄
Me: Am I seeing this?
Theres this guy in my school who used to be the cool kid but that died down, he still acts like it tho, I imagine this is him at home🤣🤣
此处应该@周杰伦😂
The ending is what real commitment looks like
Lol
the beginning is literally every tiktok guy
BRUH- last day i saw your subscriber around 300k but now 400k!?WTH!?
This is totally my brother
poor boi who fell on da muddy water
69k likes and 699 dislikes Keep it that way
69k likes,669 dislikes. Nice
Plos twist: he's not acting. He really is that cool
One like=one rip when he fell in the puddle
He falled  That sad 😢....
damn, thats *cool* dude
You are just amazing .please accept some love from India  bro
I hate only 1 thing about him and his channel        They are way too short, I want to see more of them
nice try, this is just Casey Frey
You don't even need to try bro
I’m getting Michael Jackson vibes
Woah! What an alpha male.
0:41 I was waiting this to happen 🤣🤣🤣
Nice shades btw
Ok ladies - we’ve all been entertained by some poor fucker like this x
Almost as cool as me... I mean, I don’t mean to brag, but I am prettay cool.
He looked pretty cool ngl
Title should’ve been : When guys try too hard to be Michael Jackson.
8 MINUTES AGO AND THIS HAS 4.8K COMMENTS ALREADY
Yo that jacket thing was sickkkkk
Lol guys always do that thing where they throw something up then catch it for no reason🤣
That’s me  First day of school.
Why is this reminding me of Bully Maguire? lol
From personal experience trying too cool isn’t cool, what’s cool is that knowing you are cool in your own belief, aspects, qualities, talents, strengths, weaknesses, and mindset. That is what makes that person a very cool person to be around with.
Why he looks like Hrithik Roshan?
🤣
HAHAHHEGAHAJJAHHHHAGHAGAHAMKFJJSJSHHA ME LAUGHING SO HARD NOWW😂😂HAHSGAKJAHAHH😂😂😂😂😂
The fact that he literally just fell into a huge puddle always gets me 😂😂
There HAS to be something with him and his fridge
Nah man, we’re just trying to be an action movie hero
Jim Carrey + Ryan Reynolds
Now this is swag
Why do I imagine him as all the bad boys of Wattpad stories?
I just am so shocked on how well he tripped in that puddle
When you have that one kid acting cool in class
I was cracking up so hard at the end.
MOST sporty kids at school:
Guy eyeing up my daughter went with her to sort the horses and did not heed the warning to wear old clothes.   Went head first into a pile of horse shit, the dog rolled on a dead flattened hedgehog and left it on his coat then his Ray-Ban's fell off when he was running away from geese.
9 year olds when they won against a bully
Not saying im trying to sound cool but these videos are the GOAT, super Dope, Gucci even, they are Lit OMG so SALTY-SIC, Snatched bra
Not gonna lie doing that just seems like a lot of fun
My phone cut off the rest of the title when I went into full screen and it just said “when guys” and honestly that’s a more accurate title
My man probably broke line 14 cups to make this
I've done that lmao
Do: If people had no bones/ acted like floppy noodles
That jacket flip was actually kinda clean though
When you watch too many movies
The cool kids at school that don’t play with me:     NO JOKE THEY ACT LIKE THIS
That's Nate diaz! LOL
This dude is the funniest ever 😂
Should’ve dropped that glass when you flipped it. That’s a typical cool-guy move.
That is one cool dude
This is literally a representation  of the majority of Male population in Southern California LOL
This is what commitment looks like.
Alright That caught me
Bruh moment
Belive it or not but I had a friend who was exactly like this, we didn't stay friends for long lol.
So cool
We've all had someone like this in elementary or middle school
Just subbed😎
Nobody:  Me, an introvert who has no idea how to act around people, when at a gathering:
And some girls fall for that shit😂😂
Reminded me of Zack Ephron for some reason
High Schoolers be like:
LIL Peep fans: "When I die Bury me with all my ice on!"
Me evryday
That ending is the best part
Looks like Logan paul in every video
You know he's a cool guy HAHA
I think I know this guy
The sacrifices this man goes through.
Jeremy Fragrance be like...
This guy is very flexible! I'm impressed!
PLEASE PART II!!^)
When he walks it reminds me of Thomas Jefferson's (Daveed Diggs) walk in 'Hamilton: An American Musical' lmao
He should have just shown any of his other vids.
This guy actually had to soak himself and his clothes with mud just for a gag.
Why is the movie 1776 in the recommended of this video
This guy saved 2020😂
This is called the jock
At 0:35 he looked like Ryan Reynolds.
I knew something like this would happen at the end😆
That is literally me
Wow this is hard to watch and im a guy btw
0:43 dat slip though
this is my brother everyday
Ahh mann he is so cool
Nobody: 11 year-old Justin Bieber:
This is Johny Bravo on daily occasion
When he fell into the mud it had me almost pee myself 😂😂0:41
this is the best Making-Fun-Of-Straight-Tiktiok video there is.
00:11 I can imagine him retrying that stunt over and over again and the glass just smashing into the ground each time
Never before have i been so offended by something i completely agree on xD
I Love This guy
The fall in the end made my day!!! Thank you :)
Exactly.
i like how being cool is just flipping things around
When guys try too hard to get views on YouTube 🤣
Así imagino a Bruno Mars.. jajajajaja
This is not acting cool, it's just having a good day
0:41  Girls : boo🤮 Bois : cooooooooool😎🥶
ngl I kinda do this sometimes.
A man with this amount of self-amusing ability is pretty cool imo.
He's my new favorite internet comedian.  Number 1 is remmi gaillard
most of these are me when i have my favorite song stuck in my head
He looks like a « teen » who looks 22 yo in some High School Musical type of show
This is so lance from voltron
I'm so glad he isn't uploading this on tiktok
Make a video on types of handshakes people do
The real life Sugimoto
Me listening to that one song
I would surely like to see behind the moments.
Finally today I saw his face clearly. We can see it barely since he is doing everything in a rush
The accuracy is 💯. This guy's so funny. Gotta subscribe!
This is me listening some cool ass song and trying to be cool in my imagination...and thinking my crush is watching me..
😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂
I wanna watch part 2 !
You mean The Douchèbags
yo bro thats totes magoats
Lmao🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂👏👏👏👏🤪🤪
I do most of this thing un ironically when Im alone, but I also say stuff like “it’s show time”
*since when am i cool?*
How people think they are gonna act after watching alpha m. once
Ending is always dreading
Viral kid
I almost died during the last 1sec..
YOU'RE THE COOLEST GUY OF ALL THE COOLEST GUYS EVER. PERIOD.
That mud splash was pitch perfect
Me when i was a kid:I want to be cool 12 YEARS LATER Me Watching:im....
You sir, have changed how I open doors from now on
LMAO 🤣🤣🤣
Maybe when you know you ugly and you’re home alone 😂
I love you man❤️.
LmFAo
Reminds me of Toby Maguire in Spider Man 3
wow I'm not the only one
The last scene😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Lmao
Dat boi smoothhhhh
Is this some sort of personal attack
He behaviour is totally opposite to The Termintor's behaviour.
ngl, i'mma try some of the stuff.
retitle should be: when 12 year olds see a younger kid at the park
Grease movie in a nutshell
Like even tho he is making a joke of these type of people , he actually looks cool 😂
Imagine that the cup falls to the grown ಠ﹏ಠ
Dean
Bro.. I appreciate your works.. I mean how hard you try to make us laugh..  You just literally fall for us!!😂👍👏
0:27 that was actually kinda smooth tho
This is one of my class mates he is always trying to be cool
0:42
Suspiciously you seem like you have done this before
You actually fell in the puddle for showing how pretentious cool guys would fall. Wow. Great effort mate
This is like every chad ever
Coolnes maxed stats be like:
0:27 idc what anyone says that was the smoothest shit ive seen
BROOO YOU SHOULD HAVE DONE PUSH UPS IN THE PUDDLE
Basically most teen does when there's no one around
So this is what cool looks like... I shall take notes!
Ima really have to try that!
We must protect this alpha male at all cost!
This is me all the time and I'm not even a guy
Middle school boys:
I found it to be cool when he opened the door at 0:27
I got an ad longer than the video now give me likes cuz i said funni on internet
Ohh Mann,Julia he's at it again
My anxiety level up something or someone falling was 110%
swiggity-swag your body is now in my bag
This guy would be amazing for a robot or cyborg movie part, he has such an amazing control over his body!  In this video he makes me remember the gigolo from the AI movie XD
Basically the popular kid in a high school movie from the early 2000s
Wait, he didn’t jump up and touch the top of a doorway-
Reminds me of Dante form dmc
so... being cool is more like... Bad tobey mcguyre?
Bro stop making fun of me 😂
you have nice floors
Aka- when you have too much self confidence when walking up to a girl and showing off to get her to like you.
Ok sir, no offense but... I’m thinking you might wanna calm down a little on the... showdown thing you’re doing
0:27 alright that was cool.
when he opened the closet i thought he was gonna walk into it and just shut the door
I was waiting for him to say “SHAMONA!”
OMG THE STAIRS THING WAS DO TRUE 🤣🤣🤣
This is so relatable lol! Not the first part, I fail at all of that, that last part is just relatable!
Literally all the guys on tik tok
This is the definition of all the boys in my class and the reason why I'm single
Tiktokers be like
Sorry 0:42
At 0:32 made me laugh so hard😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
0:27 Someone could make a song with that
I do those things but I’m not trying to be cool I’m just being weird
Lmao the ending
Falls in the puddle: moon walks on his face
the ending really got me..
:41 when the puddle is trying to be cool🤣🤣
I wouldn’t know how this feels.
Boys when there crush is 40 feet away:
My big brother:
I had a guy cut my hair once who was kind of like this.  He did all these fancy moves with all his equipment.  Like when he picked up the hand held mirror that has a hole at the end of the handle.  He put his finger in the hole and swung it in a circle and then clinched it in his hand to then show me the back of my head.  Moves like that.  It never stopped.  He was good at it all, but at some point it just became overkill.
I want to punch you soooo bad... guess you pulled off the act 10/10
So funny in the end 😂
This dude is a hoot! Cheers for the fun fella 😆
Alternate title: 6th graders in a nutshell
this accurately describes every boy in my school
That wierd thing they do with ther emouth
This should be rephrased as : Guys when nobody is home.
The Fanz approves this.
Didnt jump Down the stairs. NOT cool.
He watches wayyyyy too much TV
Stick to your running make-funs.... this was stupid
I'm in this video and I don't like it
I feel sorry only for the jacket.
I can feel the cool presence through the phone
when he snaps at the start o always hum the cup song by jon cozart-
Im slightly offended
That'll be a quick way to get roasted
Dan Bilzerian in a nutshell.
His house is more organised than my life.
Yes guy is hypocritical ...
This is borderline how I used to go about my days when I was like 6 ‘cause I thought being extra made me look snazzy
You should make one for kids trying to be cool and it should include them swearing all the time and going up to random people going, "you wanna go bruv?!? I'll shank you up bruv!"
God bless
Every single 16+ year old teenager in the world
Is this funny? Lol my sense of humor must be gone
legends say he never got out of that puddle
this physically hurts to watch
this is a video of my brothers
Be honest: how many glasses did you break making this
Lmaooooo😢😖😫😕🙁🤭😩😥😩🤥🥵🥱😐🥵😬😖🥱😰😬🤢👹😵👻🤖😪😺
Every male lipsync tiktoker be like:
I have not seen a better representation of myself than this.
Literally Dodge from Dodge & Fuski.
0:42 when reality hits
You gotta admire his commitment lmao
The end made me wheeze and laugh at the same time🤣🤣🤣
😂
Welcome to downtown coolsville
If you found me well done!!! 👍🏻   (Text me to get something special)
Close enough but no, todays cool kids are gangsters...😂😂😂
Idk man Seems pretty cool to me😎 especially the end, super smooth, wish I could be that cool
0:43 HA loser.
me in front of my crush 0:28
This is my brother but he does not snap
Damn he’s going through the Bully Maguire part of his life.
tik tok predators be like:
I feel personally attacked by some of those
That one friend in every group
Oh emm gee, that's so mee
I kinda do that at home than public
Bruhhhhh this reminds me of the popular kids from elementary school forever ago
You are FUNNYYYY🤣🤣
Cool people don’t wear sunglasses
I totally though smooth criminal was playing and was wondering why I couldn't hear it.
at last in last second he lagged and teleport in other place
That's me
Why are some of these so easy to relate to            Especially the last one
I feel obligated to say... we all expected him to do push ups when he fell at the end, admit it.
axel
Perfect ending
The way this guy handles stairs amazes me
This is me forward my female class mates
what, cant handle daniel labelle style
This is how I picture Tom Cruise strolling about his mansion
So funny 😂!!!!!!!!!!!!
He turned into Michael Jackson ?
Most of the people actually do this🤣🤣
😳 didn’t expect that until I saw the puddle....👀😆😂🤣
I felt like "Hritik Roshan " in him 😀
This is like half of the guys in high school
It was pretty cool doe
Cool
None of this is cool
Dude why is that me lol
You really can’t get much cooler than this. This is like max level right here
The end got me XD I threw up my ice cream I laughed so hard!
God, I knew WAY too many people like this in high school
Plot twist: he is just showing us how cool he is
Good content
Last night 323k and today 379k .. Man More faster than corona.. Fast af boiiii..

When guys try to be Michael Jackson
He looks cool by making fun of people Tryna be cool. Yep.
I feel personally attacked
Luv da endin
*how singers do everything*
Oof
Seeing as there's nobody around to impress, I think he's just trying to impress the gods and goddesses. Especially the goddesses!
Hey don't click this   I'm warning you   https://youtu.be/ORgZklXFwgE
The Coolest dude in all the land 😂
lol
I’m in love with Daniel !!
This , but you reposted in the wrong neighborhood is the background song
He gives me major Ryan Reynolds vibes
0:28 ok that was kinda impressive tho
When the aliens come...n they would, he will save us.

Does he *dance or sum*
Lmaoooo the ending tho
100 likes for his 'cool acting' at last..
literally every 6th grade boy in 2016 who wore a shirt that said “swag”
Every dude on TikTok
I like ur videos , you should be an actor my man :D <3
This is my favorite video of his
I was waiting for the fail. Because that's exactly what happens to me everytime I feel cool 😎😂
That's me every time I want to create an awkward scene for the fun of it.
Ending 👌👌👌👌
ngl, this dude is pretty cool.
Looks like a GTA V NPC
Why do I feel this is exactly how he is in real life.
That glass cup gave me the fastest anxiety ever
Nobody:   Lightskins:   (Chill its just a joke no racism)
The end is phenomenal 😂
Nobody 13yo on tiktok for some reason:
Dave strider
Plot twist: He was actually doing push-ups at the end.
0:22xx
Who else thinks tht he is cool
I actually do these sometimes, and now I'm angry because you called me out like that.    The falling over one is the most accurate tbh.
Half the guys in my grade:
I didn't expect the end 😂😂😂
Why his moves remind me of MJ?
Lmao some boys at my school do this to me and everyone in the hallways -.-
I thought this was an Eric Church video. Saw the country singer in a truck stop in Oklahoma years back and he literally looked and acted just like that.
0:42 how my toe feels when my sock is wet
so, guys trying to be cool are just copying the king of pop...
Cringed
Well ngl tho that was kinda cool~
Jojo live action
So cool!
He actually face planted into the mud for the last 2 seconds of the video just for our entertainment...
so his ex ( if had any ) might be gleefully thinking about ......"  it's a happy ending  !."
He really came out of nowhere and now he's everywhere
He is so underrated
Let me guess the dislikes are from people who actually act like this🤔🤣
just a normal day in MJ life
uh-
How can u just not love this guy
Confidence level: Max 1000
Cars 2
Daniel fell on a muddy puddle and stained his clothes for us, he did it for us!
You have a beautiful house man and you are cool too.
im trotter i see a bee i get away as fast as possible(with out makeing people look at me) but i still go the way i need to go
Call me racist but this video radiates "American Highschool guys" energy
Guys in Disney shows in a nutshell
Кто бы ни читал этот комментарий, знай, что *ГОСПОДЬ ИИСУС ХРИСТОС ЛЮБИТ ТЕБЯ!* Whoever reads this comment, know that *LORD JESUS CHRIST LOVES YOU!*
But I walk that way!!!!
Im always like this
True
Idk like to see a person that thinks that people who's like this is actually cool
I know your home better than you
0:36 he didn’t close the closet door... dislike Hahahahahh
the first one i thought he was going to say Im Casey neistat
*Had us in the first half not gonna lie*
0:42
Wow that's so cool.... in a cringe way

My god...the commitment at the end..💯☄️
R.i.p that jacket!
Last scene

0:28 the closet trick was actually cool 😂
Idk about u guys but i think he’s trying to hard
Epic
is it wrong if i think this is cool
This is actually me in my house🤣🤣
The puddle is a metaphor for my pants after watching this cool ass vid.
The ending is too smooth
The thing is.... It was smooth than even if we practice it daily
Everyone on tic tok lol
Face reveal plz
:joy:
the main characters in musicals be like:
Simps after donating their whole life savings to a girl trying to get a lambo
Never seen anyone with more swagger before... you didn’t TRY to be cool, you ARE cool!
Yes...finally ...they fail
Im starting to recognize the door, closet, stairs.... lmao🤣🤣
Yes true, but you’re actually cool-
lol ur so cute 😃
I totally don't do weird steps instead of walking in my home
Why must he shoot vertically?
I think smoking is cool an wearing hoodies
Yup...It Happens
0:27 This is cool tbh
sweet cup catch tho
0:28 was quite impressive not gonna lie 😂😂
I swear this looks exaggerated but is every bit true irl! XD
Can we talk about how he literally fell face first into a puddle for the sake of this video?
he looks like he does finger guns and says “what’s popping” and calls everyone “bro”     so me
I cringed hard
Alright, that closet clip was pretty smooth ngl.
This is the tiktok version of YouTube
Is it just me or is he acting like bullly Maguire
I showed this to my grizzly bear     *Now it's a polar bear*
This is just me home alone, with my music thumping
He rlly said:💩💧🤾😎
Johny bravo
0:42 hmm.. *impressive*
Nobody: Not a single soul: *the preschool boys:*
I'm a cool guy. I can testify that this is accurate.
A true American chad
I honestly wouldn't mind if this is how guys would act cool
You cant be cool when wearing skinny jeans. You cant be cool un-questionably falling for the jeans material worn by poor coal miners from the 20th century. The restricting, hot, single mix of material denim. Its what corporate America that wants you enslaved picked for you, only thing you can fit in skinny jeans is skinny credit cards, smartphones and vapes. We had two possible styles of pants for primary wear, jeans of poor coal miner or cargo pants of soldiers. Which can carry more useful stuff? Water bottles, bandage bundle.
I'm just mad that he didn't close the door 🤧
um. ending is something..
Me in elementary school
This cringe af
0:10 gave me too much anxiety
Okay, he knows my jacket trick...
do a part 2 lmao
Why does this looks like Schmidt from new girl?
I’m surprised his house has not fallen apart lol
That was still pretty cool though
But u cannot beat Rajanikan
That face tho.
Lol you nailed that ending
This is a music video without the music...
The way he fell in the mud
This reminds me of Spider-Man 3
I can't binge here anymore today. My face hurts from laughing... Now I know where to go when the world SUCKS...
The jacket 😅😆
Not gonna lie, I was impressed by the drinking water skills ahhahahahahaha
That’s me🤣🤣
Now that is one cool dude!
every 11 year old boy when there moms friend calls them handsome
Not the awkward strutting
Imagine being his neighbor and seeing him do this.
hey dude wicked moves bruh (insert *dank* meme here)
This guy is so funny 😂
You forgot randomly high diving pullars
That's just me when I'm feeling good while listening to music and nobody is around.
The fact that this guy actually fell in that muddy water just shows us how serious he take his skits 👍👍👍 keep up the good work man
Need more vedio broo..... 😎😎😎
Y’all he needs to be the lead of a comedy movie
Nailed the ending
This what TikToker does...
1st graders when they see a 6th graders
Me at that point: Get the hell away from me
This is the man Bailey fell in love with
Guys in Disney movies:
Jim Carrey entered the chat
Me when I’m having a good day
Soooooo on point
0:41 🤣🤣🤣
This is litteraly every 12 year old kid when they walk by there crush
This is what I look like when I’m listening to music in my earphones and just vibing with it
This is my life as a middle schooler.
Lol
This is how I walk when I'm listening to music I swear I'm ntt trying too hard
this guy can be the best stuntman
Eshay be like
That ending tho. 😂
This describes middle school boys. Only about a third of them, though.
he’s doing the danny zuko walk
The way he barely touches the door... Genius.
Plot twist: this is him normally
I now know his entire house interior
Mans looking like star lord
Dang 56k subscribers in one day!  This guy is blowing up
Dude is a straight tool
This reminds me so much of Schmidt from New Girl 😂
nooo the jacket :((
I have those same glasses. LOL
Oh that ending came out of nowhere

U look cool honestly
He wears his shoes in the house??

You make me happy with these short videos. I think you should combine them now: if cool guys were hopping everywhere in an agressive manner....
Its the ending for me
He is just acting like logan paul
guys i found the jim carry
Every cool boy in a high school movie opening a stuck locker for a cute girl
Now imagine the guy in the video practiced all the moves he does in the video. I think the point he wants to tell us he learned out of experience.
Xd
idk but I found that cool. unrealistically.
When you try too hard to be funny and fail completely
Everytime someone complains about toxic masculinity, this guy only gets more powerful

If you can move effortlessly like that you’re pretty cool in my book lol
The swag never ends

Yeah, me too
What those men, who do that, don’t understand is that being cool isn’t something you try to be. It naturally comes to you when you see the dark world for what it is and choose to still fight the good fight of being a good man and good father and good husband. It’s that simple.  It’s rooted in humility. Doesn’t matter if it’s selfish humility or selfless humility. Just so long as there is some humility in it. Not pride. If it’s only rooted in pride alone, it’s funny like this video. The coolness that comes from pride is the one shown in this video above.   The best masculine natural anime example I can provide for my explanation is known as The Vinland Saga.  It shows the world of man aka masculinity from the prideful perspective and from the humble perspective so you can see the difference yourself.   The humble perspective of coolness and the prideful perspective of coolness are both shown via the main villains aka Lucius Artorius Castus, Bjorn and Thorkell.   The humble perspective of coolness is specifically shown via Thors the Jomsviking.   The prideful perspective is shown most of the time via Thors son the main protagonist and Floki.   But I will not provide any more details because if I did I would be giving spoilers.   Enjoy your lesson.
I pretty much know his whole house configuration now
XD that ending tho
AKA literally every middle school boy on the planet
Jesus love you, he died on the cross for you, accept him as your lord and savior he can change everything. For God so loved the world that he gave his only son, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life" (Jn 3:16"  But you must repent too. From that time Jesus went about preaching and saying, Let your hearts be turned from sin, for the kingdom of heaven is near. (Matthew 4:17.
Can we just appreciate how he actually had to fall in the mud at the end though—
But you’re actually that cool tho
Kinda curious what his neighbours think of him...
I'm rude for have my favorite part in the end
I lost it when he opened the door  0:27
This was really a guy trying too hard to be funny
ok that was funny
Aka my uncle Dave
Is it just me or did we all have mindsets like theses at one point
Be lookin like Peter Parker in spider man 3
I can tell you stalked me when I was in 4th grade
This is the most important post you will ever read.  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good deeds because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake. Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he conquered death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ;  Except a gift can either be accepted or rejected..So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9).   Do these things, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true .  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment; don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you surrender your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. And as it is written (Hebrews 9 : 27) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die , but after this, THE JUDGMENT’ .  All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ.  https://www.amazon.com/dp/1432117742/ref=emc_b_5_mob_i

That guy must have found out what else comes out of there except for urine
He fell into mud just for a video...😲
This is painful to watch..
Guy's legit kinda cool. He's made trying effortless. I present him with a victory boquet.
This is more of a young adult thing. They think the world revolves around them and they need to act a certain way.
What jacket is that? Looks nice
Hahah..new sub here bro. Keep it coming and god bless.
I have a friend like this I punch him in the face regularly but I wear a balaclava and jump out of ally ways 😂
I can clearly see my father doing all of these as a joke. And it is bothering me
5 year old boys when grandma says there handsome
For what i received i passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that He was buried, that He was raised on the third day according to the scriptures  1 Corinthians 15 3    PS: "according to the Scriptures" - what the Apostle means is that Lord Jesus fulfilled prophecy's of the Prophets of God in Old Testament. There are like hundreds of Prophecies that Lord Jesus fulfilled, just look it up bruhs and gurls. God is our Father. He is the best of Fathers, the most lovable and merciful of fathers. Read the whole uncensored Bible that is Catholic(The Original) and  pray my friends. Wish you all well🙏amen🙏
I was really hoping something like that would happen at the end😂
How does this man do everything so efficiently 😭
This is literally my dad......he does it so much it’s not longer funny🌚🌚🌚🌚🌚🌚🌚

Moral :  Acting as cool is too bad especially if there is a girl in front of you, it's costly. If you are actually cool by nature, then ok. Go cool & stay cool.
Dude I first saw you on Facebook When I saw this I clicked and immediately subscribed
0:40 When he fell, I felt that...
I feel like you’re just this quintessential normal dude and I love it
You should have ended it with push up after u fell on the mud
😯this guy is really cool
I think the end made me laugh to hard
Here's Joe Cool hanging around the dorm
I only liked the end in this video
The end caught me of guard! LOL
This has nothing to do with the video... I have to WARN you all in LOVE...💝💝... (John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.) We are living out revelations in the Bible, please choose Jesus Christ today while he can still be found. He died for all our sins. We all have sin in our life the Bible tells us and we each need a Savior. I'm so thankful Jesus died for my sins and please accept this gift on the cross he did for you too. He rose from the grave 3 days later and is seated on the right hand of God. We have to confess with our mouth to God we are sinners in need of a Savior. Turn from your sins, invite the Holy Spirit (get baptized) into your life and pray to God often, get a bible.. KJV is a good place to start!! I am praying for the ENTIRE 🌎 daily to choose Jesus today because I KNOW things in the world will continue to get worse according to what the Bible says. God is trying to shake people out of their slumber and choose him...this is his mercy on each of us!! He LOVES us so much he sent his son to die on the cross for us so we can all make it to heaven! Jesus took on the sins of the 🌎. I LOVE you ALL so much and pray for each person on Earth daily. Hell is real and you don't want to go there. I cry for those who reject Jesus, because I know things won't get better for them..🙏💐😊💝💝
Legend 🙌🙌
I usually do that but I'm almost always listening to music so it makes sense I guess
You’re one of the only creators that I’ve consistently found funny😂😂
fun fact: this is 100% accurate   _yes i experienced it_ _the disconfort and awkwardness_
Honestly I'd be impressed
You already look cool without doing all that !!

I was cycling as a kid on my bike through flat houses part of town i lived. It was summer. I was standing on pedals my head towards the sky everything socialistic flashy and I was the boss on my bmx until I crushed to skip with front wheel and i finished with my forehead bounce of it. :D
this physically hurts me
I do this all the time...And I’m not even trying to be cool 😭😭😭

Joe: the comidean that comits to his jokes.
Bible prophecies are happening like never before, we're in the end times. Are you saved by believing in the Blood Atonement of Jesus Christ? John 3:16 For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, Jesus Christ, that everyone who believes in Him shall not perish but have everlasting life. Christ said, "Come to Me as you are." It's not about not sinning (we should as we're thankful and build heavenly treasures), it's about having faith from the heart that Jesus lived the perfect life we couldn't and died for ALL our sins and raised up proving who He was and you're given eternal life. On the cross Jesus said, "It is FINISHED!" The Blood of Christ IS enough! God wants to give you salvation from damnation, all you have to do is believe in your heart and have faith in what Christ has done for us.

“Only one person who likes this will one day be a billionaire” “Good Luck” 🍀
I was a super supporter. I am.
This guy was willing to dolphin dive into mud for this video. That’s dedication
😂😂😂😂😂
How many glass cups did he break trying to flip the cup at the start?
As a guy, I can confirm that this is 100% accurate.
Jesus died for you was buried and rose again on the third day according to the scriptures   If you confess with your mouth Jesus is lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead you will be saved. Please repent of your sins and accept Jesus Christ as your lord and savior.
it would be rude to laugh but-
God he's so cool
I like to move it move it, you like to?
this guy goes too far for views
The ending earned you a sub from me!
Geek mon 🤣

That's cool.
Me in a nutshell
Next time I should never run down a stairway in public.  :-/
Finally someone relieved it to the public     😂😂
Either you are born cool, or you are not. You can‘t try to be cool.
the ending is the real cool 😎
Dammit I do the stairs thing
Actually I want to learn to put on my jacket like that.

https://youtu.be/opiuZu58UZ4
This is the vibe I think of America, especially Los Angeles, everyone just seems fake for some reason and they think there better than everyone else. Not saying everyone of course. 😂😂
That literally happend to me today in front of shop xD
0:05 my man sounds like a Nintendo switch
i wonder how many cups he broke trying to flip it
Why would you fall into real life muddy water on purpose
Behaving like a Max
Johnny cage?
I always try so hard but sadly i often lose my cool
The fact that he falls on purpose for this skit...  Kudos to you.
The last one is kind more epic though😅😅
I do that only when i'm alone. xD
Tries too hard to look cool... STILL SUCCEEDS! 😎
Life of a tryhard

He is not trying to be cool He is enjoying himself
You should make more videos like sthis! It was hilarious!
His idea is so original.
0:27 seriously? 😂
How do you keep uploading in the wrong aspect ratio?  I've been able to watch videos from this channel with the proper screen height and width.  16:9 is not the best ratio for uploading phone portrait videos in.

Ditches have always been the arch nemesis of cool guys. They strike when you look away!
My whole body is frozen for my cringe o meter has reached an overwhelming amount
Imagine that fall not being intentional

So this is how Michael Jason was

You didn't have to make yourself fall in the puddle but man you got all my respect cuz it did make me laugh so much! I respect your channel! Here let me give you a sub!
why do good girls like bad guys 😭😭
Actually trading was not easy for me.     Lost a lot of money through + 500, FBS also lost a lot of money to trading assistants and copy trader's, almost gave up on forex / Bitcoin trading.  but a friend of mine introduced me to a good broker, at first i thought it was another way of wasting my hard earned savings.  But my greatest surprise was my investment of $ 3,000 came out with $ 6,580 in 10 days trading ..... You just have to be patient with them till your trades are completed ..... To be honest I didn't just  recovered all my previous losses .. I made much more than my past expenses .. actually she charges 15% which won't affect you in any way since her trading efficiency comes in multiples of investment ...     I personally recommend Mrs Caroline trading services for best copy trading always trade with them and stop loosing your money .... reach out to her and believe me a trial will convince you     Here's her contact details⬇️⬇️⬇️     +19282916039     @WhatsApp
Please tell me that the ending wasn't scripted 😂😂
😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
just to let you know, this video makes me subscribe the channel
That one kid at school:

I was waiting for him to drop that glass...    Guess he decided to just drop everything-
That's a trailer we need a whole movie
That’s literally every guy who talked to me in high school, normal guys were cool enough to leave me be xD
Well I laughed at last😂😂
Fun fact :              He joined YouTube in 2009....
Can you imagine Dan planning out this whole video just so he had an excuse to fall into a mud-puddle he found in the woods?
Why is no-one talking about the jacket flip, smooth af
Uh shit...
Why do all kids think that wearing shade is cool
he left his cupboard door ooen now his mommy will make him cool....🤣
What?! But that's exactly how I move, open, throw and catch!.. Didn't know I tried to look cool.
That guy is cool
I see my self , except i break the glass
0:27 gotta admit, that was a pretty cool move
Why is this so spot on lol you're amazing

He has successfully achieved 'cool'
*When the side character acts like the main character:*
What a Johnny Bravo and a square
A glass was broken during the making of this video*
Thr coolest part is when he clicks his fingers😂😂
Your commitment to getting yourself drenched, dirty and/or smelly for every bit is incredible.
The dislikes are from the guys who try to be cool and end up looking like this
I love the fact that his viewers each video is more than the amount of his subscribers
Lol true xD 😂
0:27 ok but that is cool
Fun fact :     No fun fact
Pls make ur videos last longer
That jacket bit... I gotta say that was kinda cool on its own
I'm freezing
Exactly like my Brother. The cringe is strong with him
This guy walkin like he just came out of an LMFAO music video

Welcome to an era where looking like you have Huntington's disease is cool

Am I the only one who walks around my apartment like this when I'm alone? I literally do the most ridiculous shit ever when I'm alone, I've been practicing my backflip into bed the last couple weeks.
Damn. I’m a smooth dude.
This guy is a legend!
idk if you have got this before, but you look like Ray Reynolds.
Smooth criminal should have really been played in background.🎶
I can so relate to this lol
plot twist
He's unironically the coolest guy I know
Amazing! He did the glass trick without failing!
I appreciate your dedication. Falling face first in the mud must not have been fun 🤣
We all have that one guy in school
Why on earth am I imagining j-hope doing this???????
Ok but 0:27 was smooth as fuck
Wow, he even falls cool.
This is me when i'm in a good mood and know that nobody sees me xD
Cooler Daniel
That was pretty cool
I wonder how your neighbors look at you when your doing one of your videos?
Ended up being a douche
This is quality content and this is why I’m subscribed
this guy is lucky...he will be having most of his video recommended to us in future... 1 : no big channel  2 : all videos less than 1 minute  3 : we all like these 1min less old videos...      so this is world's no 1 future recommendation channel for videos
Well now I’m mad. That’s exactly how I act. Damn I need to change my whole personality
Video Idea: If everyone reacted with extreme emotions Example: If angry, have a tantrum, if scared, scream at the top of your lungs
When YouTubers try too hard to be funny..
He really did that for us
Cool kids in American movies be like :
ahh u have a beautiful house man
Idk about you but if I met someone who is like that in their every day life I would think they're pretty cool.
All this pent up coolness on the verge of exploding.
cool guy after meeting Morgan Freeman (GOD).
This guy needs more subs
More cool
You nailed it what a boy will do to get attention. Hands down.  Add a breakdance move, it will be totally perfect.👍
0:27 WTF
Dani : that really cool 😎🤣🤣
Rose's are red Violets are blue  Dont try to look too cool Because you are still a fool
Just what i predicted
That was cool
💜🖤💜
He should make an autobiography about people trying too hard to be funny
Leaked test footage of Bully Maguire from Sam Raimi's cancelled Spider-Man 4.
Well, you know what? ill subscribe

The things you do to make us laugh 😂
His growth rate is insane
Just yesterday you had about 199 thousand subs and now you have 263 thousand! Congrats.

Serious Ryan Reynolds.
When he fell my laughter sang bumblebee
Man, that dude is pretty cool.

And then he realized the camera wasn't switched on... ;-;
Getting Vine vibes
Varun Dhawan wali vibes aari 🙄😂😂
Hes a legend
He's not even trying
When guys try too hard to be cool. And literally nobody gives a fu#k !!!
Lockdown vibes
The last scene😂
A metaphor for my life.
Daniel: being cool **falls over into mud** Also daniel: do some push ups **task failed auccessfuly**
no that's jut michel jackson's dailly routine
Who have seen his whole house only in videos😂
He has more Control over his Body than most of the Athletes
This BOI should be an actor.
This is jake perelta in a nutshell
When my crush is in the house
He sacrificed his shirt and jacket for this one skit you gotta respect that
I can really relate with the last one... :)
Watching this was pain
Your whole channel is the domestic version of What IF🤔...
Me at home: cool af Me outside:
My YouTube suggestion was great
That was pretty cool
I wasn’t ready
I worked with a 16 year old kid at dominoes who used to do this kind of stuff all the time but unironically. He would glance to see if me and my female coworkers were watching and then moonwalk past the doorway.
Stress (Aki-aki sambil lembar batu.jpg)
Daddy cool
Thank you Daniel, very cool

His channel went from 90k subs to 270k subs in ONE WEEKEND
Cool and clumsy at the same time 😂Cant get enough of it. MAKE MORE. I WANT MORE.
0:42 _making my way downtow-_
At the end- him *falls* Me- now that's cool
Your videos are made with so much commitment that takes my depression away
Exactly and it’s the most hilarious thing
Cool in the mood !!!!!
I wonder how much takes the jacket took
This video he made is the definition of cringe. In a good way lol
Who else can walk into his house blindfolded now? I can.
This guy had 5k subs like only a week ago and now he has 26k subs what happened?!?
OHHHHH THATD MY TWIN
But if its Daniel then it's cool.
Those facial expressions ❤️
u blowing man
Woahhh man can't be watched at home when he's cool. But he can when he's in on the ground covered in mud.
Plot twist: this video was advertising those glasses this entire time
ur cool ma dood
my big brother is like thes he is 21 hhhhhhhhhhhhh😂🤣🤣
Well looks like we all know who wasn’t cool in high school 😂
I do this when I’m home along ngl
Cool guy pretends to be cool guy.
Thought Pulisic was injured
Everyone else is all, this guy's videos are great. I'm just here like, *what does he do to own such a big house?*
This dude is better at being the president than biden and trump
He goes by many names, but we all know this guy from high school
*lesbos:* _aight noted_
I do some of these but not trying to be cool, more just because I’m retarded
Dayum i did allmof em but not to look cool, only cuz dey fun

I WANT THE NEXT PART OF "IF PEOPLE DID THINGS AGGRESIVELY" :)
As a cool guy I approve of this message
You have given a new concept bruh!
0:42 Really I can't stop laughing, until tears come out .. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Why does this make me remember back to the future 1
petition to make this guy jim carrey's student.
You getting subs faster than that X man guy
the default character guy back at it again
You could just post most tiktoks on here and you'd be right
That walk gives me Bully Maguire vibes.
The ultimate Chad
Daniel I love you for your dedication for these shorts clips, you are ready to fall over to mud in order to make a minute or even less of content to make enjoyable content for us, your viewers. Thank you so much! <3
The final worth it all😂😂😂
He got drenched in mud for our laughs. Thanks man.
This guy is just perfect In everything.
cringe
Spider man is that you
It's only a short video but it's so fun to watch.
Best😂
I didn't expect him to fully dive into the mud lmao
0:42
Who gave you permission to record my brother
Wwowwe, thats soo cool
Me walking in my natal city after defeating the pokemon champion   Everybody pay attention The kid called attention:  My grandma: Who is this handsome man I am watching right now? Me with 6 yo:
His neighbours: darling look. It’s happening again.
This is soooo relatable haha XD
He's cool af.
Geez...
Goddamn 😂
Woah i hav seen my friends do that
What's worse is that for the majority of it he's seemingly alone, like the only one he's trying to convince is himself.
I wanna slap all of these guys 😂
this man is god
Self made mud pit or found as is?
Cool guy : *fall* Me : Can i call this "Fall Guy" ?
😂😂👌👌🙏🙏
The thing is we know his house better than him lmao
0:10 I imagine how many glasses he broke before It worked out, or if it worked out in the first try
looking for Ray Mak
Looks like Tobey from Spiderman 3
He did that really well doe
*This guy's so cool he can solve global warming*
Lol thanks to YouTube I discovered this channel, incredible
Basically all my classmates at my old school
After falling into the puddle for the first time: "WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU DIDN'T RECORD!!!"
He should have started dong pushups when he fell down😂
This video reminds me of my history teacher 💀
*That's me out there after getting a correct answer in Maths class!!*
Lol
The next Charlie Chaplin
This looks like the stuff I do daily but I do it in a deliberately goofy manner  I’m not trying to look cool, I’m just having fun
*I witnessed the same Daniel whom I have always been knowing was at 0.43..*
In my head: Peter in Spider Man 3
This is literally me when he does the "Aaaaahhhhhh" thing after drinking water.
Relatable
The thing is, this is not even exaggerated. This is very accurate. I mean, this is what we feel from the inside.  Me: * gets 1k likes. * Me: * googles how to handle success * Thanks for the likes people! Be cool whenever you want to!
I honesty thought the 9 hours ago was 9 years ago
I don't get it. All I see is a really cool dude going about his day.
Thats me when girls around😋😋😋
I coulda sworn this guy had less than half of the subs he does now yesterday
don’t forget the: jumping over 5 steps of the stairs “oh yeah it’s not hard at all” jumping to touch the little ceiling and reaching always around those 3 friends laughing loudly as if they have a good life
*Dante has joined the chat
Nobody:  my frnd  infront of girls
Honestly I'm subscribing for that level of commitment at the end
pretty cool ngl
Im ashamed to say Thats so me  But thats so me
You forgot to make a push-up at the end to look cool...
You earned a sub.
Try not to be cool.
I don't even understand what cool mean anymore
the last part of the video is so cool.
This is fake cuz he didn’t do push-ups after he fell in that puddle
Physical comedy is an underappreciated artform.
To be honest, that isn't trying to be cool. It's just being funky
This guy is so cool I turned into an iceblock
We need the girls version
He’s pretty chill about life
Daniel: I'm cool Water: really??
Im here before 1M subscribe
this end killed me xd
Holy fuck i do all these things at home lmao I'm a loser
Me when I listen to Michael jackson
The screen is too small
The last one 😂🤣 *F to Pay Respect*
so  thats a room tour of his whole house guys
He is the only human to ascend and descend the same flight of stairs hundreds of different ways
He has won... But at what cost
It's Jonny Brovo!!!
Good one bro love your videos
LOL
Aren't we all cool?
He’s everything
Dan the man
Bully Maguire in a nutshell.
Oh no 🙁...

Ending was too cool

Love your content man 🔥🔥
Ngeselin banget 😂
You forgot to stand by a wall with one leg up hands in pocket constantly looking both ways
*Damn...Ima smoooth dude*  :
It’s Ace Ventura!
Is that Michael jackson?
It reminds me of those 10 year olds making their voice deeper by themselves and take a whole other attitude when they meet a teen girl to impress her.
I saw his channel yesterday at 136K And it's on 259K in just a single day!!
If people did things lazily
when the fall is too real that you cannot tell it is staged or accident
Daniel: Trying to be cool Mud: I'm going to ruin this whole mans career.
That ending though-
This is so true
At this point he doesn't even need to do a house tour, we already know bro 👍🏽😂
Fastest growing channel in YT
*You can only aspire to be as refrigerated as this man*
mom : why don't you play with the neighboor's kid ?   the neighboor's kid :
Me in my home 🤐😪🤤  Me outside -

Everybody in 90s:
Tik Tok E-Boys:

Its not even a hobby anymore but a lifestyle 😂
C o o l
He looks like Ryan Reynolds

How male birds attract female birds.
Damn!!!  Did you literally just do that🤔
He couldn’t have been more cooler
Soooo true😆
You forgot going up 4 steps at once on the stairs
Fckn genius.
Nice ending
This is me when
I am in this video *and I don't like it*
Only able to fill water up 1cm without interrupting flow  Commits and acts like its the most refreshing thing hes ever tasted
Tbh it is somewhat cool
When he wore that jacket that was smooth af I kept repeating it.
I wonder how many glasses did he break to catch the flip....
for me he's actually being cool
This is what I do when I am home alone
Dang! He got screwed at the end!!! 😂🤣😂
This guy took one for the team and fell in a puddle of mud for a video. What a cool guy.
I liked flipping things because it was fun.
That’s one cool dude
This is like me on a Saturday and I have no homework
Ahhh what a nice da-
0:27  *ok that was smooth*
Alright rhat jacket put on was pretty smooth
Ok but...     That was sooo cool!
this video made want to fly to where ever he is and slap his face, but then he fell over on the puddle and i can save my money now HAHAHHA
0:10 This is how many attemps that took him 👇😂
Guy tries too hard to look cool he became a squid.
That was .....               Unexpected 😂😂
0:24 That descent from the staircase was lowkey smooth tho
Your videos have this weird relaxing quality to them. I like that I can pretty much always expect the same setting, and not much speaking. It's comforting in a way idek
why do i have a feeling that this person used and posted on Vine before
He fell
Umm ending 😂
LOL
0:40  POV: your the puddle and you just beat up the cool guy
Honestly this just looks like a dude constantly jamming to his fav beat
d
The fact that he fell in mud just for us makes me feel special
He got damm moves like jagger
*the old classic move to try and impress your crush*
Every guy when they are home alone
if dani would be here he would say 'wow that was very cool👍'
End is aaaaaaah
This guy’s the only person I’m willing to watch who films in portrait mode.
I feel ashamed now
Me in front of my crush be like 0:03
Where is he going tho?
Plot twist : That is how he is in reality
better title: PEOPLE WITH LOOSE JOINTS
Too many kilojoules wasted

You r the next Jim Carry bro.  😝👌
Hehehe lovely all moves 😝😍
Emo Peter Parker from Spiderman 3 be likes:

He kind of reminds me of Jim Carrey
This guys so cool he's pulled like 150k subs in 48 hours woah
0:27 Honestly that was cool!
0:42 hahahahahahahahahaa
Discord mods when the E-girl joins the call

This guy just oozes cool! 😎
This was me in middle school, and probably every other boy idk
I had a friend exactly like this.. never had a girlfriend.. 😂😂
This explains almost every 5th grade boy-
His face kinda looks like Enrique..ngl
You call this trying? Pff
Yesterday his subs were 192k. Today its 257k. Howwwwww!?!?!?!?!?!?
You know the last part was a real mistake. 🤣🤣🤣
The end is me doing push ups
He  kinda looks like Ryan Reynolds
That’s some commitment to the bit! Dirty laundry < comedy
That's so cool
Aww was expecting him to go widescreen finally..
Groovy
I believe he has no workout routine. Covers pretty much everything in these videos.
100% white boys trying to be cool in movies
You must have re taken every shot because everything was tough to do
When guys try too hard to be funny
A tinge of Jim Carrey
Video Credits- Toby Maguire, Sam Raim's Spider Man 3
Are you a mocap animation actor ?
Did he ever retake?
U did to start seeing Indian movies from know.lol.
ME:-Who Are U *JOE* ME:-JOE who? *JOE COOL*
This is literally my cousin
0:27 ok. Now that was cool.
In high school, you wouldn't have been cool unless you jumped up to touch that ledge on the roof 0:24
The bizarre thing is that he is trying to impersonate somebody trying to act cool but he actually pulls it off well. Making the guys who are trying to look cool look way better then they actually are.
At the last unexpected 👏👏👏👏
This is a new species of comedy!
He always ends it with him getting hurt or looking dumb AF
You are too cool.man 👍🏻
Dude please don't make me remember those dark memoriest
for some reason I was reminded about Michael Jackson from this video
This reminds me guys on Tinder ansjsixjzjj
I do like how your videos are never without a closet.
I can say the last scene it's super cool.
The amt of content he gives us is just- *chef's kiss*
Mission passed!    Respect+
Every 12 year old
Ad before the video. The last video at this time. Released 7 hours prior. So the journey ends for now. Watched every video. Bell is on :) 5 more videos and you'll fill 15 screens on my phone scroll!
Tiktok dudes be like:
Most of these are me
Damn the number of new subs this guy is getting on a daily basis is insane! Well deserved though 👍🏻👍🏻
I have the same fridge
this is me walking around my parents house.
8 yrs old Me when 8th Grader said You're cool
Pretty normal
I don't do any of it... But yeah this is me 0:41
Relatable
Ahhh yes the iconic hat we all know and love
Dude these are so funny 😂
This reminds me of the main guy in psych 🤣
At the end of the video, it was toooooooo cooooooool. 😅😂
Me in bathroom-
Okay Shawn Spencer
this is my recommendation vid.
Why is this me though especially with the whole jacket flip thing
I cant believe this, that puddle is a paid actor
It is cool...
why is this so accurate wtf I'm embarrassed
Man now I feel like an idiot
Never in my life have i put on my glasses and snapped my fingers and started walking liked that.
This is literally my little brother, and I'm just around the corner watching him
this gives michael jackson vibes
at this point watching all his videos i know almost his whole house
A familiar ending for all of us.
An alternate title would be: *Middle Schoolers in a nutshell*
This guy finally gets his followers. 3 days ago he was at 100k now at 260k🤯🤠
He's cool, its official now.
Pov: ur a 1st grader
He sacrificed his dress and face for this video!
Sad Ending
This guy really remind me of ace ventura for some reason.
The way he opened the door to get his jacket was so SMOOTH😂
Me in front of my crush
Imagine how many glasses he broke just to show us how cool guys are
I actually found the opening door pretty cool
Over of everything is harmful at the end😆🤣
0:00 - That's a very unorthodox video for y - 0:42 nevermind.
0:00 *COOL* 0:42 *Cooldown*
Send this to that one guy in your class
He's fucking balling
Troy Bolton the whole movie
The closet door hahaha
This man have made his whole courier by just filming himself
When you already know something tragedy is going to happen at the end of the video  😏
bruh i swear you literally had 59k subs a week ago WTF
Wow he has a smooth move
Johnny bravo
you forgot the part where you throw the glass cup across the room
It's basically just Michael Jackson
Ok, but can I just say when he opened that closet door. That was actually pretty snazzy.
This is me when i prove someone wrong!!
Am I the only one who thinks that he kinda looks like Ryan Reynolds
Lol this is so my classmate xD
Jim Carrey anyone 😂
how about if a cool guy fail every time.
A.k.a every middle school boy
Man I don't know if u have ever done a Q&A or live. Please do it sometime

I tried to be cool but im kinda lame
im so split on this channel, on one hand the content is actually good, but on the other *tictok*
He do be lookin' cute tho
I need to see a bloopers reel.     Also did I mention how cool that guy was?
I have a friend who actually does things like this but it's mostly ironic lol
He reminds me of Bully Maguire.
Funny video and all but when he opened that closet that was smooth af
I'm fairly sure this is what the "Cool" stat in Cyberpunk 2077 looks like to the AI.
*DARK PETER PARKER WANTS TO KNOW YOUR LOCATION !*
Yesterday he was at 200k today at 250k legends
we know this man's whole house

I’ve seen so many dudes do that exact walk down a flight of stairs

Ok, let's be honest here. Taking that jacket from the closet was actually kinda cool.
Me when I'm home alone
Cool kid alert 🚨
This should be called-  How I wish guys acted when I am around.

Low key that closet opening was slick

Hit the like for the puddle at the end   The sacrifices he’s made for the betterment of humanity
That door open was pretty cool

I subscribed to this channel about 3 days ago, it had 50k subs then Aaaand now this channel has f. ing 250k subs. It literally gained 4x subscribers in just 3 days.
Michael Jackson in real life be like...

Me as a kid when my crush is around

Juul at at schuul is not cuul yo!
Underfresh be like:
straight boys on tik tok:
Well tell me if you (or anyone else here) would do much better
Lol also the fact that he flipped that glass cup without being nervous
Alternate title: dad’s after that check from work comes in
I’m in this video and I don’t like it.

Me in school
To be cool you just need to train train your body and that s it
Always bear in your mind that Daniel always do fail in every end of his video.
Me every time I’m alone at home

14 year old boys when they see a new girl at school ⬆️
Nothing embodies the word "Douchebag" as much as this video right here.
This is just me when I’m home by myself
I can't look cuz he is too cool
perpect.
I swear the last time I saw videos like this was in 2008, this content reminds of the original and early youtube years when everything was just about having fun
That last sound affect was me after eating Taco Bell.
We need if people swam instead of walking
Men wish they were him
But you are different, you have the style to be cool guy.. Everything you do probably not be cringe at all lmfao
This guy went as far as to purposely trip into a muddy puddle just to make us laugh. What a fucking GOAT
This guy is already cool enough
Imagine he fell and it wasn’t recording💀
5 year old me after the janitor calls me buddy
When the

The end tho-
Guys he stole my glasses :(
The end was pretty cool tho
OOF, that splat at the end surprised me lol
Before filming: Which of these jackets do i care about the least?
What else is he missing?
All of it was actually really smooth... But then he tripped.
Rolled a nat 1 when you tried to cross the puddle.
Sad ending😂
0:04 The tripod is what makes you cool *insert finger guns*

The worst thing of the video is when he tells facts
I literally know every corner of ur house xd
I love how he just does this for fun tho
this guy is like that male version of that girl who can act almost like anyone (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIfdf90ctybSVAL3x1-2cZw)

He is so cool that the puddle got jealous and destroyed his coolness
Rewind this reversed    Even 🔥 flames on of a man being cool
Okay, but I do all of these things when I'm listening to music, even if I'm alone. I mean, play this video again, but this time with "Stayin' Alive" by Bee Gees over the top and it becomes a lot more bearable from an outside perspective.
This guy gets 50k+ subs a day
Kids in my school be like
Ok lets be honest, he just filmed himself throughout the day.
Why is this literally every male character in every highschool movie ever *cough* *cough* edward Cullen *cough* *cough*
The fall somehow reminded me of Charlie Chaplin
Cool
Level 99 mafia boss
The way you grabbed your jacket killed me😂😂😂 but at the end when you fell, I shouted “NO!” and got upset.     I still laughed though😊
Good ending
The fuck boy energy
Chadus-Maximus

Laughs in introversion

QUESTION (READ THIS IF YOU WANT): Will you go to Heaven when you die? Have you lied, stolen, used God’s name in vain, or lusted (which Jesus said was adultery, Mt. 5:28)? If so, God sees you as a liar, thief, blasphemer, and adulterer at heart. If you die in your sins, you will end up in a terrible place called Hell. But there's good news. Though we broke God's Law, Jesus paid the fine by dying on the cross: "God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life" (Jn. 3:16). Then Jesus rose from the dead and was seen by hundreds of eyewitnesses. He fulfilled all the prophecies of the promised Savior. Please, today, repent and trust Jesus, and God will forgive you and grant you the gift of eternal life (Eph. 2:8,9). Then, to show your gratitude, read the Bible daily and obey it, join a Christian church, and be baptized. Visit NeedGod.com and LivingWaters.com
I personally am a guy and this is the most uncool thing ever
Read this if you want, we all fall short of Gods Glory, and broken Gods law(Murder in the heart, lust, etc.) and there must be a punishment for sin, but the good news is that JESUS CHRIST TOOK OUR PLACE, we must repent and turn to Christ and dont trust in your own understanding, Repent and put your trust in Christ...He who endures to the end shall be saved•The gospel⬇️https://youtu.be/4exu-7RDdKE•Watch a poem "THE GREAT I AM"⬇️https://youtu.be/bYTypUb_Jc4
The title should be when girls try to hard to be cool. Because I only see girls doing this at my school, idk if my school is weird or something but I’m telling the truth

Today in the morning him: at 220k subs Today at night: 250 subs
Why do you always wear the same blue tee?
Have the same first name you have but i wish i had the same comedy skills
I slowed down when he fell and it seems it wasn't on purpose (pls tell me it wasn't on purpose)
I'm pretty sure this is some Jamiroquai video clip rare footage
Seems legit.
This was literally my best friend/gf's dad when were 3, and I was at her house watching Lion King with her, and her brother when he got home from work.
That also me

If people did everything back words.
That one kid in school: *Zooms into action* So you think you're cool?

Why does this whole thing remind me of the emo Peter scene from Spider-Man 3 😂
I would not call that a level 100 boss
If this shit goes viral bitch im the 82k. View
Wow this guy is cool
Urgh the memories.  I remember as a kid i'd have to stay away from these guys because they were guarenteed to look for someone to target, coz appearing aggressively sadistic was part of the image. 😕
The commitment with this man
I just had to laugh at the end XD
Ahahhahahha i didnt expect that ☠️
I swear you gained thousands of subs in an hour-
When ever u try to be cool is when things got worst 🤔 so me

This is every guy at my school (like if you agree)
It do be like that tho.

ah yes, i can say this is true. those pre school kids in elementary be like:   0:42
You should do if people crawled instead of walked
I do stuff like this....      BECAUSE I KNOW IT LOOKS STUPID AND IT MAKES PEOPLE LAUGH (except the falling in the puddles. I don't do that on purpose, I'm just clumsy and do it on accident. It still makes people laugh tho...)
😂😂😂😂😂😂  Absolutely brilliant 🇬🇧

How different ages play hide&seek and How different ages react to being scared would be epic to see.
Last week i saw him somewhere around 100k. Good to see this channel getting the attention it deserves.
That's me when I wake up thinking I won't have a bad day full of mental breakdown and depression attacks, and then life just slap me and bring my stupid ass back to reality
I used to work with a guy that looks just like this, except he had a chain wallet and a motorcycle.
Perfect ending!

DOES DANIEL REPLY ??
The dedication is real
THIS GUY IS SO FUNNY
Its dan the man
The first 9 seconds of this video made this guy indistinguishable from Justin Bieber
You should’ve done Spider-Man’s dance while walking around
Zoolander 3
D a m n
Its Bully Maguire
just found this channel and i'am laughing so hard!  subbed!
When u try to be funny but ur cringe af
Sorry man, but you completely failed at "trying" to look cool, because you look TIGHT AF RIGHT NOW!
This vids are amazing ngl.😂 Love this dude🔥
Tried jumping into coolness but landing past that straight into douchebaggery.
You do a great Tom cruise impression
If anything, I feel called out.
The perfect graphic description of my brother
What Redditors think they look like, when they tell others they use Reddit.
Why is this exactly how I act
He was feeling himself the entire time, even when he had the chance to go outside and show off his coolness to the entire world, he decided to continue to feel himself alone in a forest, and for that he deserves that mud puddle.
😂😂😂
Is it just me or does this guy legitimately look cool while doing this stuff?
Bruh the fall 😂😂
Thats become just weird
Dude belongs in the 90s
Who else was expecting him to go down the stairs two at a time?
This is every 2000’s high school  “cool guy”  cliche
His house is really nice
if people Crawled instead of Walking
Why does he look as jim carrey?
This is roughly 70 percent of all men
Bro😂 so glad I found this channel
He do be smooth tho-
Deadass me when I was 12
Though, but true
Throws switchblade over his head, and catches it with his hand without turning around.
Thumbs up on the video just for the sacrifice of diving into a puddle!
I think the title could also be "When boys feel any type of positive emotion"
I have no idea how you keep coming up with so many ideas-- I'm getting so stressed out for you ahaha
I was cracking up the whole time! 🤣🤣🤣 Definitely one of your funniest videos!
It do be like that
Dude, that’s kinda cool
Let's face it. Everyone has known a person like this at at least one point in their lives.
Trying to act all cool and falls in the mud don't worry about it to easy *HALF RIGHT HUH*
I don't know man, that was pretty cool....
Sad how he is alone acting cool
This is a physical comedy...
When he took that drink by the fridge who else wanted him to chuck the empty glass over his shoulderXD
this will blow up
Wow
And just like that, I have subscribed.
It’s like the beginning of a movie when the main character is going on a vacation
This guy has every stat maxed out
this is dumb
HEY I do those things!! But I'm also a girl so I guess it's fine. : )
I don’t know why but this is pissing me off a lot.
I find this very relatable       But the things this guy does for YouTube 😂😂
Every middle school boy ever:
Big respect for him for sacrificing himself in the last part just for the video
The DEDICATION
Detective Cabanela be like:
Always the stairs
Chadius maximus
Guy sacrificed a jacket for us
You're just describing my morning routine after a girl tells me to get out of here house and how did I get in
0:27 damn that was cool
Dude that last part tho.....commitment
Coolness 100, Attractiveness 100, basically Everything 100
The fall at the end had me dead 💀
What a fraud: actual cool guys throw the jacket in the air, put their arms up, and the jacket naturally fall in place...
Ngl, he definitely did look cool.
I now BELIVE this man can do anything to entertain us
You fool I am already cool!
I would wear emiya clothes And say  “Im the bone of my sword”  After that im gar enougth
I laughed soo hard lol
I wonder how many times he has practiced just for this vid
Mike O'Donnell when he becomes 17 again:
Sub to my YouTube channel
My first tought when you took the jacket was "jesus christ what a fine jacket" and then you went literally straight to jump into mud and it hurt
too smooth
Кем он работает, что заработал на такой крутой дом?
I've just finished studying for 13 hours and this is exactly what I need right now
0:43 I think he meet 2020.
Shades from 😎+ mouth from 😦 = Danny
I actually cringe because this used to be me.
The last part was especially cool imho
Support him plzzz💜💜💜💜💘.
The only thing bad about this guy is that i haven't discovered him earlier
imagine if he had to re-take that scene of him flipping the glass cause he dropped it or something
i freaking love this man
Legendary!
Alternate title - boys on tik-tok be like
Every Kyle ever.
The   *c o m m i t e m e n t*   this guy has. Was not expecting the last part XD
Next video: If live was lived backwards

the fact that he did the last part just for a video.. Damn
0:31 But that jacket flip looked dope as hell you gotta admit.
هههههه  هههههه
You're cool !

That end.      THAT END
Me trying to act like him in my recent video
I love how nobody is complaining about vertical recording on this channel😂
Waterproof
Bully Maguire walking scene recreation please.
Looked like you belonged in a zoolander film with that strut at the beginning xD
Daniel doesn’t need to try. His cool stat is already maxed out.
did someone say "spiderman 3"?
The ending is me every time I even attempt to be cool
"Mom, the guy next door is being weird again!"
You should try out for some acting roles. Your body language is flawless
Can we appreciate the fact that this man acc face planted in mud lmao
Before new year he will cross 1 millions  subscribers 😎😎
This is just me being autistic at home
ha ha so relatable
This is a basic reference to the mind of a middle schooler.
Throwing my glass around like at 0:09 is and will continue be part of my routine tho!
His house will always be imbedded in my mind 😂
Alternate title: me in a nutshell
Chad.
This is accurate asf 😂
Aka my younger brothers
ngl some of the moves where quite smooth
Me thinking I am the coolest guy at the party  What I actually look like:
The awkward mouth movements make it too real 💀
I feel personally attacked.
i can feel so much ultra chad energy here
Everything thing was built up for the final
Just discovered and subscribed today. Thanks for the laughs!
Hahahahahaha
My gut told me. He is going hit 1m sub soon.
Yep I hate people showing off straight to my face
Daniels body language is so similar to Jim Carrey ... I love it !
I loved the end 😂😂
TikTok in a nutshell
Ok but the closet one was very cool
That last part had me laughing so hard!! I love your videos 💗
That’s probably the most famous staircase known to man
This is me back in elementary school...
RIP to Daniel's nice clothes
The best finish for these dudes! 😂🤣😂
There is always that guy at the party
0:41 9 years old while playing in rain!!
Me when being silly is like:
Ahh yes, I always trip into a mud pool when i try to be cool.
Damn you should become an actor
it's so true some men are always like this
B)
This is so funny!
Truly unexpected ending 😂
way too cool
I did not expect that to happen
That lil footwork he did to open the closet door was cool
early squad
Me when I get a c- on a math test:
Every guy at my try hard school
The sheer dedication of this guy is absolutely remarkable! 😎👌🏼
Honestly your the coolest person in the multiverse
Petition for him to start adding bloopers
Could someone play this with the music from Spider-Man 3 of Emo Peter?
I expected this video to be over 5 years old and have 1m+ views
I love these videos also why is this so true
Every 11 yr old in elementary after seeing their crush in recess.
He never closed the closet door...
I never expect your videos to be funny when I click on them but they always got me rolling lol
this guy is legit speed running youtube
Do if everyone did everything dramatically
His commitment tho
not gonna lie you got some cool moves but the last scene killed me :DD
The only thing i missed was the pants slightly down but yeah pretty accurate mate
introducing.. my friends.
I like the way he went downstairs after the kitchen scene when the kitchen is already downstairs.
dang
0:00 I can only picture Tobey Maguire dancing.
I really wonder what his neighbors are thinking when they see that this man changes his personality everyday....
Masterclass
Anyone else notice this guys subscribers jumping he gained 20k today its crazy
The end tho
Dat level of dedication
Why is this guy so good at moving
Me after completing No Nut November.
E-boys in a nutshell.
In higschool you'll always  find someone that acts like that.  Or the fake depressed boys that wear a black outfit whit long black hair and allways are talking about death.  Or the guy that acts like if he always were horny trying to hug girls everytine they can and not in a friendly way.  Or Chad, no one likes Chad.  Ps: fuck off Chad.  Edit: fuck you Chad.
Me irl.
😂😂😂
Go out in public and do something agresif man..,
My 10 year old brother:
My guy why you got to do me like that I always act like this when I'm home alone😂
I love this guy. I’m sure he suffers making these videos..
Looking cool as ice chili cheese
when u trip on ur own foot..  aaaaaahhhhhhh 😂😂😂
This guy is so unfunny I don’t understand how anyone likes him
0:03 - Literally 98% of guys do this
Early
I think he is cheating there is no way he opens the door with any recoil.

Hell yeah dude your channel is exploding, about time
This is literally me doing my things in the house, to the only difference that there is no camera. But I have a much better “mud pond detector” thought. 🤣
Idk this guy, but he's been on my recommended for a long time and i like it
Lol 😂😂😂
Oh. It's Chad Narukami
Why did i want to punch him on the teeth
I always enjoy watching you man. Keep it up
I agree
0:28 that was smooth
Can i have my girlfriend back
Boys are like this even when girls aren't around 💀
I cant explain how much I love this channel.
I felt that splash
I don't see a guy trying to be cool. I just see a man vibing.
A new meme video LETS A GO
OMG THIS IS SO TRUE!!!! Also, why is this my brother 24/7? Except my brother is this, but much lazier and never wakes up, always hoards food, is kind of obsessed with cars, and likes burp and fart jokes.... And I have to deal with it...
I can relate
Plot twist: the dirt is a paid actor

Being his neighbor must be one hell of a ride
I want to know how many takes it took to get that closet shot
Haha i was wondering how you would end that one...that was majestic 👏👏😄
This guy's dexterity is off the roof
Imagine this guy in school 💀 he must've been extra but in a good way where it was funny
I admit: I smiled.
Wow it was easy for me being poplaur I got poplaur for having issues /:
Let’s be honest, we’ve all done this at one point in life.
That was EVERY guy that wanted to impress a girl
Dear stranger whoever reads this: . . 👇 God bless you and stay safe. You are a smart and awesome person.
This guy literally had 109k subscribers last week now he has 239k the gain is crazy.
basically 2nd grade boys
The way he moved his feet...   It’s just too accurate.
Man that last part, dedication to the skit
The way he put the jacket on was too clean 😭😭
That's what i like
This guy is funny, it's like most videos keep me smiling then there will be 1 or 2 parts that really get me to laugh. 😆

That was a mix of Michael Jackson and 60's rider guys in movies
I actually never tried to play cool So I have question, how dose it feel?
Ur exposing me jk
I'm not ashamed to admit that I'm still like this at 21 years old.
0:27 sequence 😎
I feel personally assaulted
Holy F i wish i was that cool man.
But face it.  He's got moves.
Omg unexpected final 😂😂😂
This is what so many over dramatic tv shows are like.

Has anyone noticed that he's gained like 150k plus in like 2 days? That's insaneee! My prediction is that he's gonna have like 500k or 700k in 2 weeks.
He’s getting recommended to me so much wow! I don’t know what he’s doing, but he totally figured out the Youtube algorithm! Every time I open Youtube, he’s the first or second recommended video, and he’s recommended a few videos down too. Wow!

My biggest pet peeve is when someone don't bother to close the door
So Like every Teen nowadays
