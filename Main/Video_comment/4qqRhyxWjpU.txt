Wait. YOU'RE THE SIMS GIRL!!! my mind is blown ive been watching you for years
They are cute, but it's better to just buy a bookmark or use other materials. Just because it's free now doesn't mean it's okay to take them 😅
Ur literally the sims girl!!! I LOVE UR VIDS!!
I dont get it, its so much effort for a bookmark?
Totally genius thank you for adding wonderful things  to my life
Thank you I need to make bookmarks!
That's pretty cute.👍
Its not a mistake ✨ ITS A MASTERPIECE ✨
Yes!!! Gonna do itw/other stuff 2!
Probably shouldn’t encourage everyone to go in and take “free” samples from Lowe’s because they’re not actually free. We end up paying for them in our prices because people keep taking them, When they shouldn’t.
Wow those are so cute
Those are such a vibe
It’s all good until you turn them around and they’re full of random words
It's not free in hour place huhuhu
SO CUTE
This might just be the best diy I've ever seen. Easy to make.  Cheap to make.  Looks great.  It's useful.  Most of the diy don't cover all of this, even the amazing ones because there are some awesome ones, are too expensive or need big tools to make.
That’s cool
Where can you get the stickers
That’s paint tester
Love this idea!  And I'm pretty sure this adorable crafter is brilliant! 😊
Woww, this is so creative! Nice job!
Ma'am you can't do that
Very nice but I would be embarrassed just walking out the store with that free stuff in my hands
where can I find the this music
I don't even bother with the crafts, I just use them as bookmarks
Nice and cool bookmarks.
what I do with those paint test things is that I take the white color, then I make an ID out of it
Did you go ahead and trim them down? Aww you DARLING!!!!!!!.!!;??!!!;!;. puke.
The twine and stickers and tape aren't free tho. That's literally only 1 free thing out of all the other components.
Her: Making this out of free stuff Me: So the stickers and sting was free?
You're not cute
this is much better than using the receipt from buying the book …. noted
I gotta check that out
Pretty 🥺
You probably spent more money on petrol getting there than the free stuff you got tbh. Still neat
Dude not sCaTcH  tape its scatch tape
No entendi ni vergas nose ingles
So cool
Got damn she should find something to fix them teeth
Can we just take a sec to talk about her beautiful smile 😌👀
that smile lmao jesus
Please stop talking.
They’re not free for crafts. They’re free for people who want to paint.
The dried flower stickers were free?
You do know that those paint sample cards have a have a cost associated with them which someone is paying for? So really, they're not "free" to free-loaders, just free to the customers who are there to buy paint. Taking what you want of those samples is like reaching into someone's pocket for their spare change. "It's only change, it's cheap, they won't mind." Stealing is stealing, regardless the value of the item.
HEY HEY HEY we’re YOU free
Wow😁
5 minutes crafts busy taking down notes now...
The kersten dunst teef are so unsettling.
Your weird
Ooooooh, I want one 😍. You should continue making cool stuff. Cause you make free stuff seem very stylish, accessible and useful.
yeah because fuck people who use it what it’s supposed to be used for. It’s not “free”, they have a purpose.
Too easy!
Totally beautiful vid, a 5 min craft that doesn't take 45 minutes to complete!
I actually did that but instead used my own drawings so I could choose the design and I cut on the lines to have mini bookmarks. Honestly I love these so much!
Love it
Noice
Aren't bookmarks free
How did she round the edges so WELL???
That is so cute
I saw you in Lowe’s
Home Depot: we’re on to you now!!🕵🏿
That’s super ugly, and looks like what my nana would make
That’s called stealing if you don’t intend to buy their paint. They don’t put them their for money customers to come take free stuff.
Creative...ya😁
This is so cool
Very the mom from season 10 of AHS. hope you don't go bald after taking the black pills 🤣
I'd like but it's from buzzfeed 🤢
Why does her smile give me "stands over you while you sleep" vibes  o.0
When she holds up the card with the flowers and smiles, she kinda looks like Kirsten Dunst.
Oh my god  Get a job  Get a boyfriend   Get a cat  Get something
That's very cute.  I personally wouldn't like the paint names on there,  but it's rustic so maybe others love it.
So pretty
You just copy after people so you get credit
Very nice
So cute!!
Where did you get the stickers?
How stupid
It’s weird I’m just saying
Cheepskate
So cute😍😍
so cute!
Omg soooo cute ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ
Omggg awesome
It looks gorgeous yet modest at the same time.
Love it🤩😍
Now I'm gonna do this for my mom ( who loves books) for EVERY SINGLE CHRISTMAS from now on...
THE HOLE IS FOR SAVING THE SENTENCE
This idea is genius!!!
omg now I’m gonna do this, time to force my mummay😍.
They’re not free
dont let them see the back
❤️😘
Now I'm not allowed to take paint swatches I took to many.
Could of used the hole to mark the word you left off on…
What is her @ I need to know
Rip that ranboo ayyy
I have like 30 bookmarks
Ok but the cutting is so smooth
“Free” except not to the environment and not to the people who have the cost of paint hiked up to account for this “free stuff”.  The idea is sweet, I feel like the execution could have involved some more renewable resources, like cardstock she already owned or something.
oh my god i really need lowes here in the uk now haha
part 3 plz
I didn’t know where she was going with this, but WOW the end result looks great!  😃👍🏼
Oh you’re assuming I can read
This is stealing and stores are starting to charge for paint cards because of stuff like this. Literally could buy cardstock for the price of the gas it takes to get to Lowes.
I heard that vegan teacher im so sorry 😭
Even if they're free is still I'd feel like I committed a crime
She's just flexing out her creativity
Worker: *sees a girl walk in* Girl: *walks out 10 mins later* Worker: *sees paint sample* Worker: so that’s what people come here for now in days…
Who is the creator? This is genius.
When I was a child me and my sister used to spend a good 15 minutes collecting all of those color things.
cute!
Look for the KILZ samples - they’re basically large white pieces of sticker paper
Please at least buy a quart of paint when you take the color swatches!   They won’t be “free” if people just take them without purchasing paint.
Hehe
O.o i love it  I want it
it's still stealing even if its free bc its free for a purpose.
666th comment yaaay 😁
anybody else thinks her smile reminds you of Elle Fanning?
I took 5 of these when I was little and thought I was cool cause I stole free shit 🤦
I would've lost this in a week
The next day at Lowe's... "We're out of the paint samples" *wonders why* *goes on yt* "That's why"🥲🙄
I want all those paint swatches
You should sell stuff on esty ngl-
But you still have the paint numbers, that would bug me.
I did not know that?
Theres something about it not trying to be weird but i just love your smile😍
That free stuff will not be free much longer because of stunts like this! Those swatches are for people looking for color swatches for painting their home!  Not for crafting products! As far as I'm concerned, you are a thief!
Awww
Unrelated but usually when people make stuff like bookmarks the books are ones i dont recognize but when i saw the "A Court of Thorns and Roses" at the top i was like OMG! i've never read those books but FINALLY something i've heard about
and she picks the blandest colors of them... at least go for evergreen or a goldenrod
Hello my name is Renee de Graaff and I'm from Holland I'm writing this letter cause I'm in very big trouble.  I did something stupid I did drugs a couple years ago and floated away from my family. They were not treating me to nice when I was a kid but not threatening. Like my father touch me when I don't want to be touched. Nut mother ordering me around and my brother bully me play the boss all the time and for 4 years bossing everyone around faking his autism making use of our insecurities. It was very bad till the point when I studied and failed I decided to go travel and maybe not go back because of my dad and brother and my mother wasn't very good eather. I gave up on my family cause they didn't show any change. And I didn't feel the need to have contact with them.  Now this is where it went wrong. Now I came back and did more drugs. There was since emotional contact were made which triggered something in me. Or I dont know I think this must be the problem but I'm not sure.It is very bad that's what I know I saw my energy go down and down nothing what I did was helping new, and or made of berg very confusing for me because of all the drugs. Beside that I dont have any friends never had so none could help me. Then it happened, the reason why I am crying out for help. People where gasslighting me. They where trying to finish me off.and they continue to bully me (I have been undergoing severe bullying all my life so sadly this is not new to me) but something it's happening to new to me people,  please help me! When mgt energy went down I kept on running and it helped! Everybody wad focusing on me but not helping me, not as far as I could see. Nobody ask what is going on with me and they are trying to finish me of  . My vision is blur and I'm so tired. Hello me anyone. I'm in a clinic now and even the ugliest weirdest people are using me to gain popularity. I don't know how I could have fallen so deep but I want to climb up our off this mess and into safety. Hello me please. I don't want to die.  I've been abused by my family all my life they where manipulating and bullying me giving my brother everything and touching me nagging about everything and playing dumb when I tell them about me being bullied at school. Hell I was so depressed I almost killed myself because everybody around me was bullying me and noone was really nice they are all fake. I almost killed myself cayse I saw no way out. I need help please get me out of this beast hole they are all bullying me death cause they think it's more cool than really using their fists but it's not. I'm not trying to be cool or something I'm being mentally abused. They are all playing with my emotions.  Wtf is this shit jezus help me help me.
I love bookmarks.  I use hang tags that are cool from clothes.
You can also laminate the bookmarks...😉👍
LOVE THIS BOOKMQRK IDEA!
Nah
Cut off the numbers/color names
00:14
The next time I go to Lowe's: Wheres all the cards...
If everyone does this they’re gonna start making those card disappear lmao
My brother and I used to snatch a pile without looking then quiz each other and guess what the colors were named
Amazing
great..now I HAVE to do it XD
She has that im kidnapped signaling for help smile
This is a super cute idea!!!
So very aesthetically pleasing.
We hit peak human omg I love this
Cool idea
omg i made coasters from the free flooring samples at home depot
Wow
This is so cute reminds me of those slides for microscopes
Awesome 👍 thanks 😊
Send me some. I live in Florida.
I used to walk down that isle and take as many as I could fit in my pockets
Well.. swatches aren't free in country where I live. 🙄
Theyre so pretty
Things like this …those Lowe’s paint chips will become like the free perfume bottles we used to have in the 60s…gone  because people take them for crafts .
That's really creative.  I have over 1,600 books in my library. Bookmarks are a must.
Yall shes reading acotar
Cute
...is scotch tape like normal sticky tape or is it like, something specially made for this?
Sorry for spamming this on your videos but…:You have to make more videos 🥺🥺I LOVE YOUR CHANNEL 😭
Super cute!!
The names are still on them. makes them look tacky and kind of cheap maybe take the names off? Then it'd probably look good
U CAN TAKE THOSE HOME?
Very good hack, I will definitely use it, but can we just talk about how she is reading ACOTAR??????!!!!!!!! Absolute gem of a book and it’s one of my favorites!!! Literally squealed when I noticed the words on the pages were familiar to me haha!
You could put another swatch card on the other side too!
I used my paint swatches as bookmarks too but i didn't do anything to them cause they're already premade bookmarks lol
These paint swatches aren't "free" ... They're a courtesy for people trying to select paint color. Taking these for other purposes is such a selfish and stupid thing to do.
So cute!!
Glad I'm not the only one who uses the paint swatches as bookmarks!!
Ñ
i am so doing this
Whats her user?
I just got some paint samples and this is gonna be greattttt
What’s her @ on tt?
What’s her @ on tt?
Whats her name ? Does she have a TikTok
You know using $1 bill as a bookmark is cheaper than an actual bookmark
this did not go where i was expecting but that just makes me wanna do it on my own 😍
LOVE PAINT SWATCHES!!!! I actually made a piece of wall art with them I had a old earring thT I lost the match to but anyways it was a tear drop shape and was about 2 1/2 in long×1in wide traced the shape on a bunch of paint swatches that were all complimentary colors and glued them down in a circle working my way out and made like an 11×14 and it turned out SOOOO cool!!!! I framed it and  painted the frame to match I chose 1 of the colors out of the swatches!!!!
i have to do this.
Yes thank you!!!  I'll do this with real lamination and maybe I'll finally read again.
You have the prettiest smile.
She is 5 minute craft if it went well fr five minute craft is like 24 hours craft like fr lol but I love it
Cute
Wow that is so cute and easy wtf
That’s stupid
Love those!!
But why
Paint Swatches are Godly
It looks like something an adhd 2nd grade  student put together smh.
Look at the back sweety you shoplifted ( I still do this not nomore tho its boaring)
OMG WAIT EVER SINCE I WAS LITTLE IVE BEEN USING THOSE AS CRAFTS AAAAH
is it just me or i just cant walk in on a home renovation store and grab the free stuff and just walk out of the store? i have the feeling of just buying something in the store without being looked at by the employees weirdly ;-;
Also making bookmarks out of stuff that would become garbage feels good too
Ngl, those look really pretty 😍
Aw fuck she's right I now want to color code my stuff now
Awesome
This is really cool! But what paper did she use for the flowers? The see through one? I want to try this!
can someone tell me her tiktok username,i wanna see the other parts
Those cards are not just given away for "free" exactly. They are offered with the expectation that you'll be buying some paint. You are not supposed to just go in there and pick up lots of those cards and carry them out without any intention of making a purchase.
Lmao nerd
So cute!!
bad video BASN!!!!!!
Oh my god! She's beautiful!!!
This actually pretty cute 🤔…
In which shop sale
What’s her @
“Awwww, i love wasting paper and doing useless things”, this is why i have no interests of making a relationship with others, i dont want to work my ass all day coming home just seeing my girl doing nothing but this, i would be furious
That's really cool but if I made that it would be somewhere lost in a few days and I would have no interest in it😅  But I actually like what she made who knows I'll probably try to make it one day
Only problem, I haven't read a book in 10 years
Not the flowers reminding me of "flowers from 1970" and me almost crying 😭😭💚💙😭
I wonder if stores will start charging for these types of things that aren’t meant for crafts but just as they are intended, because so many people take them for crafts 🤔
Remember when tiktok made Starbucks’ workers suffer with the custom drinks?
What's the audio called?
Very cool and ingenious 😉
I actually used the Walmart paint sample cards to teach my son his colors. I was broke and couldn't afford to just go buy flash cards so I found all the colors of the rainbow and black, white, grey, and brown. It worked so well and it was free!
The world would be a MUCH better place if DIY channels were like this. Most of the ones either are stupid/useless or it sends you to the ER 🙄
Personally, I’d cut the words off. Other than that I love them!!!
YOUR SO CREATIVE
This lady actually makes diy crafts that are tasteful and worth attempting
This girl's smiling cuts remind me of every 80's sitcom on earth 🤣🤣🤣
😐
I love the smile...🌼
I hate to be a negative Nancy but if people start doing this, they'll stop giving away free samples. This is not "DIYing from free things", this is taking something outside its intended use and just, well, taking it. They have these so people who are doing home improvements can do so easily and don't have to borrow one or two swatches at a time like furniture stores often do. It would be free if it was in the recycle bin... the end result is cute, but can people please stop taking things just because its there?  BTW, it isn't just her. People do this all the time at hotels, for example. Just take all the coffee and kleenex and tp because they can, not realizing when they do that the price eventually goes up for the same room. How about if you don't need it, don't take it, and if you REALLY want to get creative with free stuff, go dumpster diving. You can find a ton of cool shit it the dumpster or just walking through an alley.
Wow
Omg so cute!!
Taking paint strips to use for other than intended purpose is stealing
this is an actual craft
Well the stickers for free tho 🤔
I always go to Lowe's and get the peices left over from the saw that people dont want, i always offer to pay but they give it to me for free anyway which is cool, its always peices of 2x4 or plywood but i can make cool signs and mini furniture and stuff with it
How did you get the edges so round?
U should make some braces smu
You are so adorable!
Remember, anything is free if you don't pay for it
All that just to make bookmark?
Smart
Why didn't she sell it is quite nice
So.... you steal to make a craft?  Those aren't free things, they are for potential buyers.   Every time you take some the cost of that product increases.   Yep... sorry... but it's true.
Wow
Title should be: How to be a cheapskate
My book mark is my old metallica concert ticket from 2019 😂😂😂
To be honest this is so cute
Shut up
white people i swear 🤣🤣
Her channel?
Scatchtape not scotchtape
completely unrelated but her smile is so pretty
It's really cute and simple, but the real problem is cutting, I just can't cut without making one thousand sharp mini pieces instead of a straight line
Holy damn you teeth
Adorable
Well technically these strips are for paint buyers, not free for crafts
Stooooopid
Hey she reads the tribe of glass series
Why is she sooo pretty 😩😩😩😍
This is what people should watch. Not the crappy stuff 5 minute crafts does now.
I do not know Why I have these in my recommendations but I am glad that you enjoyed.👍🏽
my mom used to tell me that the paint swatches costed money.... my whole life is a damn lie
Those are really cute!
Or get a piece of paper and fold it. This shit is so mind bogglingly stupid
That’s clever.
So cute 🥰😊☺️
I love the paint swatch isle
Sooo you don’t have to pay for those? 🧍🏻‍♀️
That is cute!
She that!!!!!!!!!!
wait. im actually going to do this.
This woman is the definition of proactive ✊
What 5 minute crafts wishes it could do
Where credit.
She used the word long instead of wide
When you don't have enough money for dollartree
Well this stupid stupid who would actually do this Other than idiotic people, don’t steal kids it’s bad
She did really good. Only picking 3 cards, I would have went a little crazy!!
So cute!!
Hey, that's actually pretty cool.....
I would literally open a book just to use that
Stop with the masks already 🙄
Credit the fucking creator
I love this
She's freaking adorable 😍
I never understood why people make bookmarks. I always just use a piece of Paper or a magic card or whatever
I despise buzz feed but this channel is actually kinda cool.
Those teeth lol
Free = Someone else payed for stuff you just took despite not going to use them for the intended use (making an informed purchase)
You just did show it off-
"uh sir the tiktok girl is stealing paint cards again"
https://youtube.com/shorts/4qqRhyxWjpU?feature=share
what's her tictoc?
Her teeth bother me for some reason...
Wow ima do this next time o go there
I need to make these for my art books so I know what page im on Instead of looking though the whole book to find a blank page!
Why? Just shove a random paper in there and call it a day.
So now painters won't won't able to do their jobs, because every out of work, stay at home mom can attempt being creative. Nice!.
Your smile is trash bahahahhah
Or if you go to the library they will give you a bookmark. Hope this helps 🙏
5 minute crafts except it's 1 minute and actually useful
this is great
this is very cute
Those paint things I think are actually for examples to see if you like it or not.... And usually they order these and these orders costs quite a lot of money!!!! Your just making it more hard on workers then
Free stuff! Let's get our free paint Swatch! And then presumably buy flower stickers, and tape, and those tassels! - there's literally one free thing on there...
imma need to follow this series!
I made these back in yr 3!!
I once made 750ish bookmarks out of paint chips, Since the students at our school tended to put the library books upside down ALL THE TIME. All the books were in bad shape, The bookmarks helped a lot :3
This is like 5-minutes-crafts, JUST GOOD.
Inb4 Lowes upper management executives see this and start charging $5 per paint card. XD
I’ve been using a hot topic coupon that expired over a year ago as a bookmark
Plot twist: the scissors cost money so it's not free
My Mum and I made a dry-erase calendar, with paint-chips. 😋
JSHRHRH- I WANNA DO THIS BUT WEIRDCORE- lil eyes, maybe some bugs..
Apparently, paint stores are talking about no longer using free paint swatches because we crafters take them too often. We should probably stop :(.
😐
Woa so cute!
This is so cool! Might try this sometime
You sound like that vegan teacher
5 minute crafts where u at
THEYRE FREE????
What's the bgm?
Wait there free
Wait you can just take them
Omg I'm definitely trying this
Anything in lowes is free if you try hard enough
why did i immediately think "phone case" when i saw it done
Who is she???
YOU ARE TELLING ME THEY ARE FREEEEEE????? I THOUGHT IT COST LIKE 50CENTS BUT  WTH IMA GO GET MY PUR-
I can see artsy douches go overboard stealing  this crap eventually ending with it being remove.  Or not who knows
When you spend more time creating literal garbage instead of reading actual books.
Your bookmark is more sophisticated than your reading taste.
She needs an orthodontist, yikes
Omg how are you this creative  I'm 14 year old boy and I can't even draw a flower
That is actually so cool
lowes: no that's not how your ment to play the game
Awww I love that!
She should quit buzzfeed
☺️🤠🤗😇😇😇
And this is why these will no longer be free
Beautiful!
Me wondering where all the paint strips are🤔🤔🤔
Why do people use the term "obsessed" so loosely...you like the bookmarks. Just say that.
deadass ask a lowes employee for something to hold a spot in a book or a something and they'll give you a price sticker  source: am a Lowe's employee
Completely useless and more trash
"How can I show it off without losing my place?"  Just keep the book open and take a picture lmao
Buzzfeed get outta shorts
Stop smiling I'm miserable
When she said “time for the pretty stuff” I wasn’t sure if she meant the art or her.
I love how happy she is with her creations, it's infectious 😁
You previše stediš am i right?
um for me the paint swatches cost like 10cents each
if you have paint at home and don’t want the color names visible, you can color match your card and paint over it! using this type of card is also very good for practicing color matching, plus you can repurpose them to these book marks!  edit: damn i need to look at my shorts comments more often LMAO
I thought it was just me taking those paint things never knowing what to do tho
Because of you we all are gonna have to pay for the simplest stuff.
I just fold the corner of the page
Obviously drank the vinegar
I'm sorry but I really hate your smile
Your awesome
As much as this is a great craft, does anyone that isn't 100 years old really like the aesthetic of muted tones and dead flowers?
Meanwhile five minute crafts be showing hotdogs as straws
Want to know her name and watch her other videos 😍😍😍
Ok wow I was not ready for something easy, ok dam your cool like the cool 5 min crafts
Those things are for picking a color for your wall
I'm living in Germany and don't get it right I think. Is she just taking the colour samples with her?!
That’s actually cool though.
Her smile is so fake
Five minute craft got nothing on tou
this shit is such a white people thing
This is bad
Those remind me of herbarium journals that we did in science class, man but that was years back
5 Min, Crafts :
She’s good at smiling
O
You know just cause you CAN have shit doesn't mean you need it
Id rather date a wall then you omg
As a kid I used to take so many of these Amd cut them super small bits and make “mosaic” style pictures
this is what 5-minute crafts thinks they're doing
This is very pretty indeed
I want moreee
THIEFFFFFF
Noice
Cool
Y
This is actually really pretty
You're freaking me out lady
Omg those are so cuteeee
She kinda looks like a teacher in my school that quit because of the students
What was she gonna do, give it to someone else?   How to spread covid 101: share masks.
How old are you? You could be 14 or 40.
It may be free to you, but it's stupid expensive to get all of those paint swatches. Think of that next time!
So making things out 1 free item i got from Lowe’s and 2 other ones that were at home
See ! Thats what iam talking about man look how happy she is she made the most usless meaningless thing i can ever think of but she found happiness in her stupid pointless creation why cant i be like her ? WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME !
I would’ve painted over them or drawn on them at least
“The prettiest isle?” How dare thee! The lighting isle takes that title by far!
Why ? Buy one from shein for under 1$
Lol wackest DIY I’ve ever seen 😭 not everything can be diy nor can be
Why her teeth look like \_/
I like home Depot when they had free floor samples
Wow 🤩
Imagine going to lowes instead of home depot ewwwww
Cheug
That is so pretty!
Todays are hard to get free stuff from markets, they have cameras
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life." -John 3:16(bible) "the wages of sin is death"-Bible. Therefore God the judge has given man the death sentence due to man's sin, but because of God's mercy, he gave himself(god incarnate/jesus)to die on a cross for the sins of the world. That means he paid our fine and if we trust in him God can legally let us go guilt free in court/judgment day and have everlasting life with Him!
Since 20 years I collect paintswatches and wallpaper pieces and use it in my card making.
You should do something to the back of them all the white and words on the back kinda throws off the whole vibe.
So beautiful and cute!
Wow that's a pretty idea
This is easy and useful !! Its deffo better if YouTube advertising these kind of vids more than crappy diy channels
Oooo science-y looking! I like it.
You are so cute❤️✨
She must be a jew
She was reading ACOTAR 😏😏😏
This is actually cute and easy to do. Ive just started reading a lot more since covid and have been looking for more bookmakers cause I like to read multiple books at the sametime... Anyways, these are way nicer and cooler than my current book markers; an old candy wrapper, a super hero card from a Dave and busters game, and a unused bandaid in the wrapper lol
Her smile is same as neha kakkar If u guys don't know her lemme tell u  #nehakakkar ....☺☺☺☺
You have too much time on your hands-go help out a food bank or donate something to a woman and children shelter-
This woman is genius.
It literally wouldve made so much more sense to leave the windows open and use as a book mark. If you get stopped while reading you can move the window to where you were at in the sentence and see where to start again😌📖
5 minute craps : WRITE THAT DOWN WRITE THAT DOWN
Ahh that’s so cute qwq
I used the paint cards to make a geometric art piece for my wall. With a board from the dollar tree and a frame i had, it was a 30 minute project and only $1
my brain has been tainted by craft channels, i’m always expecting to be disappointed and angry but hers are so good
White girls be like 💀
They're so beautiful and that aisle is really pretty 🌼
Wow that was so good
Those are actually cute I wanna do it but my aesthetic
So sweet!!
I love this idea...especially because I love  these paint cards!
Later the store will charge people for the sample lol
That "free stuff" is meant for paying or potentially paying customers.  So yeah, she essentially just stole stuff.
Those are pretty dope.
Need me a neurotypical white bih who gets impressed by bookmarks and live laugh love signs
Finally a D.I.Y. that's easy to make, isn't expensive, and can actually be used in real life multiple times.
Waittttt these r cute
Are you Jim Carrey daughter👧????
Her DIYs are better than 1Hour Crafts
I'm actually going to do this.
ok this is the diy that i can actually do it myself 🙂
So because of people like you, some places charge for paint swatches.  They aren't really free.
Nice....🌾🌻🌿
That's actually so cool! I could definitely see this as a cute gift.
Those are ugly. IMHO
God loves you!
I would've cut it a bit shorter just so the names of the paint colors were cut off too that way it would look just a bit more uniform and professional, still looks amazing tho 👌👌👌
Young Lady that can be your Job  Book Marks ...
Ahh! Everytime I go to Walmart I get paint color strips! I make pins for my backpack, earrings, anything! Just draw what I want, and cut out of the different colors! Glue it together, and add a gloss and boom!! Free cute stuff!
Wait that's so cute
Those paint cards are not free... BuzzfeedThiefty
6:58
Dude, I gotta do this the next time I go to Lowe's. Which shouldn't be that much of a wait, my dad goes like every week 😭
Dumbest thing ever. Take a walk hippie
I just use candy wrappers lol
Whoa omg it's so pretty 🦋🤩
Wow
Oh, it's actually good and cute!
This so dumbb! you took something that could be useful for somebody else and made something useless from it that is uglier than the materiel u used to make it,
Does this happen to anyone else tho.   U take a swatch and even tho we all know they free. U still feel like your stealing
it's very beautiful but adding those plastic hard cover things will make it last longer
Credits?
So smart!!! After work I'll run over and grab some to make bookmarks .. sweet😉🌹
I'll try this one too, but I'm not real good at this stuff so I doubt if I will be as happy about the turnout as you are but I will try
I know what I’m doing next time I go to work
Tacky
This is what 5minutes craft should be
Free??? Omg I wish i had this
You said "stuff" which means more than 1 item. So what other items at lowes are free? You only showed 1.
Marks off
This is why when you wanna paint your walls there’s no more samples  Also guys this was just a joke and also I’ve never been to a place where the were no more of the color myself either only them mixed up though
What the heck is that smile
God that fake smile..
Adorable!
This is about as ok as people that take a bunch of produce bags at the grocery store for dog poop or small trash bags. Nothing is free there is a cost somewhere, this will eventually get passed down to paying customers.
i used to steal paint samples there and used them to make paper dolls
Up next diy pocket combs
Her DIYs are actually really pretty and easy
Eventually they're going to make you pay a deposit if people keep wasting these paint samples.
She's cute
Terrible. 😂😂😂 just buy one.
