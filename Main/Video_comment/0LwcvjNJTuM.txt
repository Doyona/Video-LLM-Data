Much like the intro to Neon Genesis Evangelion and both seasons of Peacemaker's intros, it is actually against the Geneva convention (somewhere) to skip Free Bird.
A timeless classic

Bro said hold my beer ... I'll show you a guitar solo
To this day, it's still smoking hot as ever when played really loud. Who would've ever thought that a song tells a whole story about life like this. This timeless masterpiece "Freebird" never gets old, and continues to be a rockin' jam since 1973. The iconic band Lynyrd Skynyrd brought rockin' jams like these to motivational standards.
キングスマンは胸糞要素がね… ゴールデン・サークルのウィスキーとか日本人目線だとほぼ被害者なのに悲惨な最期遂げるし
the only way the song ends is it fading out. that means, IT NEVER STOPS its just going to another place
Absolutely breathtaking music! It’s like a fresh breeze for the soul. To the person reading this, I hope you achieve all your dreams and live a life full of happiness!

What is it about this song? I'm a 65 year old brit, never been to the States let alone Florida so southern boogie isn't in my blood but even now, hearing this song for the billionth time it still brings tears to my eyes and sends a shiver down my spine. It's going to be played at my funeral when the time comes. Loud so that I can hear it one more time.

Legend has it, that the guitar solo of Free Bird is still playing.
I've read way back into the comments.And one thing that I can say for sure, as this song is for all occasions.Happy, sad and all the above. touches each one of us different

You ad well  have a good day
This song sync pretty well on any Battlefield game btw.

I hate who hates this song
I was a paper boy, remember them, in seventh grade. The weather was so bad one morning my mom got up with me and drove me through my whole route. She asked me to read the paper to her to keep us awake. The Skynyrd plane crash was front page news. I wasn’t sure who they were until they started listing their most well-known songs like this and That Smell. Ran to the bus stop telling everyone what had happened. The 8th graders made me sit with them and read the article to all of them. Truly sad how many mustard killed in airplane\helo crashes at such young ages.
This is like, the most american song ever made.
4:43 😮😮
Listening to this on LSD is pretty awesome 😂
GTA SA good old memory 😊
This is for you Laura🎉 I'm still pissed off but it is what it is! I have your baby/ mine 😂 and the one and only my...sorry I don't share! She is my Babygirl 🎉 Whitney ❤😅😂 and don't you ever forget it. I love you ❤️
When I needed it most, this song found me again and again. Through loss, addiction, & eventual rebirth this song never left me. God Bless this band.
The guitar player deserves a gigantic applause for playing that
Even though they were rednecks, this is a rock anthem.
YEAHHHH GOOD LUCK SHIDDN!
Am I the only one that thinks the guitar solo ruins this song? I always liked pumpkin hardcore in Hayden guitar solos. I'm just curious if anyone else thinks like me

This is easily top 10 solos of all time . Maybe even pushes top 5 but idk . My opinion is based off its total statistics so it's the 8th best solo ever done on a track
Not sure why I'm listening to this unironically. If you listen closely at like 4:55 it should remind you of Forrest Gump when Jenny is on the balcony after a hippy fest

AND THIS BIRD YOU CANNOT CHANGE!!! 🕊️✨✌🏽🕉️
I have to thank " My Name is Earl"  for introducing me to this wonderful song.
Best solo of history

Nobody wants to admit it, but the best part of Free Bird is the intro.

It wasn’t buried, it popped up in the little comment box.  The word “buried” caught my attention.   I thought it was something morbid.  I’m having a great morning.  I decided to play my ‘76 Guild 12-string for my morning coffee sipping and guitar playing Saturday morning.
GTA SA  haha
best transition only tainted love (full version) is in the same league
All those free birds in their 60s and 70s now are rapidly dying of alcoholism and heart attack because they haven't had the love of a good woman for the last 50 years

I was 12, we just hit the border of Los Venturas when the cheats kicked in.
Which movie can I heard this song?
just got off probation this song hit different rn
General, we got ambushed. Why? How? When? Where? Any men down? Are you hurt? Do we need a medevac? I can't answer ALL those questions, but the last thing I remember is the Free Bird solo started playing.
...Ok I see why everyone talks about these guys so much... Feel like I just died & came back to life
this my music when i plays GTA
I have an unstoppable urge to accelerate to dizzying speeds just by listening to this.
The solo guitars at the second part of the song still sound awesome after all this time. I can only imagine being a kid in the 70s and hearing this on the radio. It must have sounded so mind-blowingly out of this world!
W song who is here 2025

My mom's favorite song, my brother played it for her on guitar at her funeral ❤️

Being human is fighting a battle you have no chance of winning, just because you can.
This marvel represents in music the best of what America can give. So, I am asking myself: were they politically too dangerous and eliminated with that infamous airplane crash?
Missing my dear friend who passed last month from aggressive stomach cancer.  She picked this song.  She was taking early retirement and getting her Harley ready for the road—so many states lined up well into next summer. 💔 Time is the one thing we all think we have an abundance of.  We don’t.  Do the thing.  Buy the thing.  Eat the thing.  Be kind, keep your heart light — nothing is as important as living your life, today, your way.
Classic. ❤

This is better than Fortunate Son. Fortunate Son has been overdone for the military videos
The theme song for single gentlemen with a mission.
You're on a hill, behind you your family in front of you the approaching forces. You say your good-byes despite the pleading for you to come with them, but you know you have to stay. You tell them that you love them and to go and not look back . You turn to face the approaching horde, there are so many but you must do this. You look back one last time to ensure that they will be safe. Then you look up to the sky  and look at the rising sun. It's time, you light a cigarette take a drag and then pick up your rifle. You lock and load, you say one last prayer and then steady your aim. You won't win this fight but you sure as hell will take a few with you. You start dropping them, one by one they fall. You take a hit in the leg and you stumble, but you have to do this, to protect the ones you love. You reload another magazine and continue firing, but there are so many of them, too many for one man. But the hell with it, you scream, you laugh like a madman and you taunt them as you bring them low. You take another hit, this time in the shoulder. You aim is unsteady, you can barely think but you think of your family and that gives you strength. Bloodied , you hold your rifle one handed, you manage to take a few more. As you are changing the magazine you get hit in the chest, it knocks the wind out of you, you can taste blood. Your strength is sapped, you fall hard . You know that this is it. You look one more time towards the horizon, you don't see your loved ones, they are safe. As you look up to the fading sky, you think of your wife and how beautiful she was, you think of your son and how he will make you proud, you think of your daughter and how kind hearted she was. Your body goes numb, you feel cold, it won't be long now, you can hear the approach of the enemy, their heavy foot falls echoing. You think to yourself that you led a good life and you know that you were loved. As you see the enemy moving forward, you pull the pin from one of your grenades. The enemy surrounds you, you laugh a last laugh, more like coughing. The enemy mocks you in a language you don't understand. As one of them moves towards you, he moves to grab your weapon. You grab his arm before he can do so .You look him in the eyes and smile. This is from my family you say just as the grenade explodes. You die with a glad heart and with fury in your veins knowing that your family will live one.

Doing a battle of bands opening show covering this song. Wish me luck😬
"It was..a joke."
Kinda song that makes you want to drive fast down memory lane with a six pack and dad watching over you.

Come on youtubetters, why do you have to run such ghastly ads?  It is possible to make ads that entertain and inform.  Your ads are worse than those 50s kitsch ads, like Murray in Goodtfellas.  Porno for boner pills,  celebrity lookalikes pushing 'diet aids' for fattyboombalattes . . .screeching frymamas about 'winning' money for an 'accident' as if that happens  so the gullible send personal info to the dark web via those 'case' scammers, cheesy crapola and if I see another Generation Should'veSwallowed with a backwards adjustable caps . .. I swear I'm gonna dump hormone antagonists in the water supply.   As if they were worth the cost to society to reproduce.  Spay and neuter them all.  Help control the jagoff population.

My brother was an amazing guitarist and I always asked him to play this song to me. He took his life at 30 years old 8 years ago and I cry every time I hear this song. Fly high my brother
Still spectacular after 50 years
yANKS ARE A CLOSE 2ND IN rOCK TO THE uk... BUT FK ME SIDEWAYS WHAT A LICK!
I know what he says about me behind my back.
I'm SO DISAPPOINTED about the shot of this song in films and social media. It's not a song about war.

4:56 the best part🎉
Where is the love button
I just added this to my car’s playlist. Big mistake.
This one’s for you Charlie true American hero 🦅
Charlie Vetter, the name of my grandfather, and the name of one true American, Charlie Kirk.  Rest in peace guys ❤
im  12 year old kid kid but i love song before 1980 instead of song's today
God bless the U.S. As for Charlie, I am torn. He was a man with a big heart for this nation, one  of the biggest we've ever witnessed. He has taught us a lot, and it's time we as a community here dont just unite and listen to a song. Rather unite together and in person as Charlie would do and use our voices and make them heard. We must see change in the nation urgently and it all starts with us. Charlie was able to light the torch. Now, we must keep it lit and light others on the way to freedom and behond. God bless you all and, most importantly, Charlies family. It's time we rise up and light eachothers torches.
You i have heard dats y im her
This one’s for you Charlie! 🕊️

There was a mall like place in our town back then previewing the new Guitar Hero game or Rock Band I dont remember which one it was, me and my friend had just discovered it and would go there and play like everyday, and whenever someone came and asked us if they could play too we told them yeah sure! one more song! and we would always pick this one because it was the longest 😂

4:42 to the end imagine dying in a plane crash but right before God ushers you in with this solo I like to think it felt like that for Ronnie Van Zant and the ones who didn't make it from the 1977 crash

Thank you 🎸
Satan said let me take away everything from him and we'll see how fast he curses your name. Still love you always will but I know what love feels like and I know torture.And Jesus now knows what I can take! I'm disappointed in you Jesus! Sincerely the creation that venimently Believed in your promises and that you were his best friend through 17 years of you apparently allowing my abuse test? This isn't love it's a car crash. Remember that God won't give you more than u can handle? So these Christians getting slaughtered, fed to lions, tortured WAY worse than you experienced! That wasn't toooooo much?!!! More like stop worshiping him for a few minutes and boom getting attacked and told while being attacked that I'm not good enough? Fill me up with doubts much like damn I thought u healed people that begged for 19 years for a scrap!!!! Allowed Satan to do literally unspeakable things to us. There's still angels sitting on the sidelines doing what exactly? Not Loving comforting or protecting that's for sure. Atheist Humans have done more to try and help heal my trauma than any spirit HELPER?!!!!! When? Get out now! I renounce your conditional kindness . I know who u are. Why show me just to alienate me for long enough that I can no longer in all honesty say that I believe that God isn't lying about his Love for us. Guess those starving children don't count because they didn't figure out the Truth from lies or repent and believe in you? Wow!!! I think you're obviously very cold to your flock that asks but does not receive healing for some reason. He literally throws us to the wolves and it's the humane people that Don't need your spirit to love and have compassion! I wish I'd never seen you! I didn't give you permission to indwell you just did and I want u out Jesus! Selfish GOD of all creation doesn't mess up? Then y, pray tell did you create evil then say it was in hell when it's not!!!! You and Satan are in this together I'm sure of it!  No way would my Father who loves me wouldn't be able to watch passively as their tortured,enslaved and killed all while believing that's somehow Love. My human father hurts when I hurt. You seem to approve by your  passiveness. If I didn't respect you I wouldn't tell you the truth!   But that counts for nothing. None of it seems too! were just your creation to do with whatever you want. If God wanted peace he'd say a word and it would be irreversibly accomplished without delay. Oh don't get it twisted I accept your sacrifice but I don't feel loved so I'm very disappointed in you! Bad friend!!!!!
4:42
Grr have her they have that they have that
Dumbest song on da planet played out PERIOD everytime someone gets wasted it's this dumb ahh song LAME
I was listening to this while playing Batman: Arkham City. The song started RIGHT at the start of the Clayface fight, and the solo kicked in as soon as Joker died from the Titan Virus. It felt amazing, it was like the universe was editing the end of the game to match the song for me. Shit was 10/10.
WONT YOU FLYYYYYYYYY HIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGH FREEEEEEEEEEE BIIIIIIIIIIIIIIRD RYEEEAH
This is the best song ever and guitar solo one of the best of all time❤😢
Great song

ISSO NÃO É UMA MÚSICA, É UM HINO!
Right now, there are people all over the world who are just like you. They're either lonely, they're missing somebody, they're depressed, they're hurt, they're scarred from the past, they're having personal issues no one knows about, they have secrets you wouldn't believe. They wish, they dream and they hope. And right now, they are sitting here reading these words, and I'm writing this for you so you don’t feel alone anymore. What really helped me start overcoming the pain and actually move toward my goals was reading Manifest the Unseen by Luna Rivers, it opened my eyes in ways I didn’t expect. Always remember, don’t be depressed about the past, don’t worry about the future, and just focus on today. ❤
nice!💫💰
This is me. Peace

This is forever Forest Gump…. In 1995, that movie introduced me to this classic hit
I love the solo i go crazy

Impossible to listen to this song and drive the speed limit while listening to this song past the 4:45 mark. Fight the ticket, the judge will understand….
‏‪4:54‬‏ DID YOU SAID OIL??
After that solo the guitar needed to smoke a cigarette
Yes, still listening.  ❤
Rest in Peace Doug! A year later you are still a free bird! Will love you always! THE perfect song you loved. PS You are forgiven!
"Freebird"  If I leave here tomorrow Would you still remember me? For I must be traveling on now 'Cause there's too many places I've got to see.  But if I stayed here with you, girl, Things just couldn't be the same. 'Cause I'm as free as a bird now, And this bird you cannot change. And this bird you cannot change. And this bird you cannot change. Lord knows I can't change.  Bye, bye, baby, it's been a sweet love, yeah, Though this feeling I can't change. But please don't take it so badly, 'Cause Lord knows I'm to blame.  But if I stayed here with you, girl, Things just couldn't be the same. 'Cause I'm as free as a bird now, And this bird you'll never change. And the bird you cannot change. And this bird you cannot change. Lord knows, I can't change. Lord, help me, I can't change.  Lord, I can't change. Won't you fly high, free bird, yeah?
2025 anyone?
Aged 14 in the mid 80's I was given a mix tape with this and many other classics on it - my music tastes changed that day.  Eternal thanks to my friends older brother!
GTA San Andreas was the best, it will be forever in my heart
Einer der besten Songs jemals.
When he says the bird cannot change you know sh*t is about to go down
looks like everyone's family passed away in the comments section and what a coincidence that all of them had the same favourite song
That guitarists fingers have to be hurting still very Awesome
I remember my dad having the biggest smile when I asked if he knew the band that was on playing when Jenny (Forrest Gump) was about to jump. The guitar solo was so awesome when I heard it. Lynryrd fuckin Skyryrd. Love ya pops. Rest peacefully
I feel so sad that a band with such great music had to go so so so so soon 😔 Every day I listen to them, my heart breaks more and more.
Free Choice you will be draphted
this song being 9:11 minutes long is diabolical
HELL YEAH
Ps and or without beer or spirits!!!!!!!
They could have never do this master piece without the help of man made chemicals!!!!
初めの曲の名前知りたい
Greatest guitar riff ever!!!
The best part of the song starts at the beginning. Stop with the nonsense timing tags. Gawd I hate the new gen. Jk. . Shit kids.

Heard on the radio notice the things your partner does like mow the grass to show they love you. Chores are chores. And ideally should be appreciated. Both parties need know what type of love affirmations your partner requires. Communication is key. But it doesn't always work out that way sometimes. 🤷🏻‍♀️ I'm tired of everyone trying to teach me how to be a good person. 😂😂
Horrible
4:38 is where the part of the free bird meme came from
This is so hefty its bordering on being disallowed
I just discovered this song, just now… Wtf was I doing for 40 years?
MY FREND SPENT 46 BIG ONES IN THE BIG HOUSE FOR A CRIME HE DIDN'T DO !! BUT GESS WHAT HIS FAVORITE BAND IS SINCE 1974?  LYNYRD SKYNYRD !!! THE ORIGINAL 70'S SKYNYRD !!!    A TRUE STORY !!!!!
🇺🇸🤮
Got pulled over for speeding in missippi on hwy 71 listening to this. Cop walked up as I rolled my window down and said "Damn. Slow down, son" I said "Yessir". We parted ways. No ticket.
Free bird
This Truly Amazing Song Was 1 Of 2 Songs Played At My Father's Funeral, The Other Being Copper Head Road
❤ Who still listening to this in 2025 🙌🏿
These guys were way ahead of their time
Just discovered this song, it’s unbelievably good, and for whatever reason the intro reminds me of Happy Gilmore
Volume's up and windows are open here in Pennsylvania this evening
one of the greatest solos ever, this should be every mans goin away song....Free Fkn Bird
Love you Grandad
Who are you waving at Happy?
This is the only guitar solo that rivals the Buudy Holly (Weezer) riff.
I beat one of the hardest ice boat tracks while listenig to this
If they were to book the local dealers today ,I become so much more valuable,these guys can go to work without their shots . Everyone knows that .

4:39 best part
Anyone seen the Rob Zombies Devils Rejects film and this song in the end? Prob one of the best songs for that moment in cinematic history, three killers and some sort of sickening memorial to them while eventually being faced with the cops and the shootout begins, wonderful ending.

One of my all time classic
When the world is overrun by hate, greed, and control, this is what we shall sing in the moment. Rise against the hate, protect those who are different, for they are also human.
Can someone please tell me other songs with a craaaaaaazy guitar solo like this? Just getting into the genre I can't believe I've been missing out for so long

Skynard and Allman bros best Southern  Rock bands of all time
Destroys hotel California and Stairway to Heaven

If you are here is because:  1) of Kingsman 2) of Family Guy's parody of Kingsman 3) of you actually knowing the song or the band already Which one are you?

Remembering my Simon who passed 5years ago and played guitar and this was his fav band
One of the best songs ever made ❤
The had this song on repeat at my uncles Funeral. Back in 1986. I was 5 years old. still remember it to this day like it was yesterday. 1000's of Hells Angels bikers there and most of them crying. Uncle was murdered outside a bar and they labeled it "hit and run" we all knew the cops did it.
Rest In Piece 🕊
Start: Battling obviously on the losing side.   Lyrics start: enemy captures point, your team has taken heavy damage.   Prelude to the riff: your team is wiped and only you remain but your ult is building.  Guitar riff hits: poping your ult, and completely wiping the enemy team.
👍😎💯🎼🎵🎵
Fights Anthem.
I remember playing GTA san andreas, CJ in a plane and just riding towards the sun, that was legit a once in a lifetime feeling😭😎

I’m 23 and I wish this was my music I listened to growing up not Taylor Swift. One thing for sure we ain’t getting back together
My first experience with this song is from the movie Forest Gump. Jenny on the ledge was pretty heavy for a 9 year old.
Love this song . A gem of true american culture .

I only listened to rap on GTA San Andreas as a kid, but when I’d catch this playing, I totally forgot about radio Los Santos. It also surprised me how incredibly long this classic is.  F**kin a.
2 August , 2025

4:42 for anyone who’s wondering when the solo kicks in
Like if you think we should take away women’s rights 👇
Is it a crime to listen to this song MINIMUM once per day? I'm Guilty then!
Yeah, there was a long time ago my dad God bless his soul. We talk about the Epstein files and how we cannot get them published.
This or crazy train when I go 😉

Nine Inch Nails lookem up
I play keyboards in my school of rock and I got to go on a tour over the Gulf Shores of the US with a group of students called the AllStars. Our tour bus driver had Lynyrd Skynyrd as his high school PE teacher and was taking the same classes as the guys that wrote this song. Such a full circle moment as this was our closing song on tour. What an incredible experience it was to hear and play songs like these!
Mood instantly lifted. Thank you for this
Australia 🌏 loves outback free bird 🕊️
We are going to rename California little Mexico
I’m white and I live in Orange County CA I was getting on a public bus after my AA meeting in the morning and I got on the bus and I looked into the bus and it was totally full with Mexican teens going to school and I stepped off the bus and I thought to myself is this bus going to mexico

Still thinking off the most iconic use of music in a scene: This song in the Kingsman church fight scene
My best friend passed away unexpectedly a month ago. This was our song. I miss you so much, I wish I could listen to this with you again
For 30 years I had only heard first half of song. Literally just heard second half and blown away.
That's right, I'm here for GTA San Andreas.
Best break up song ever

Fortunate Son and Free Bird are sort of from the same league

I liked it when it came out on the movie forest Gump . That scene made me think 😮
GREAT SONG TO START YOUR DAY. THANK YOU, L.S. 💜
4:47 good part here
This song awakened something in me many decades ago, as a pre-teen, what I suspected along, the truth about myself, my inner being, my soul, and made me realize that I am indeed, a free spirited bird. And this bird no matter what the circumstances in life are, no one will ever change! I am a free bird! May God bless the Lynyrd Skynyrd band members that passed away and the current bandmembers. 🐦🐦
@AdmiralWoodhouse Thanks! Seeing your comment in July 2025. Hope you are having a good day too 😊
Old timers need to up the clicks on FreeBird...seriously, only 62m views...bullshit

I just had to come listen to the song it's been years. Well actually, my daughter just sent me a link to a cover of Free Bird  sung by Brenna Beatty cover here on YouTube. I said no, hell no. In my opinion she ruined this song. I don't believe anyone could EVER do this song justice.

I remember when I was too drunk on a bus with my guitar listening to this song after I played on a bar with my punk band, when 2 guys tried to rob me but free bird solo just made me go crazy against them xD.... 10/10
Free Bird. Fly on, Free Bird...
Best Solo ever.... 🤘✌️🤘 The whole band backed him up on the solo, maybe that makes the difference between greatest solo or not..... Gotta love the lyrics too.....

Esta es la canción que pondran en mi funeral...
WOAH BUDDY!
Someone commented that this song is two extremes of music. Slow wordy music and an instrumental masterpiece all in one.
Devil’s Rejects
Meu irmão, essa música é a obra prima do rock. Não tem como superar. É a goat para sempre!
Saw this songs debut blows me away everything.
When you ultrakill
This is one of a kind epic solo, masterclas in technique and rythm, but it´s not like there is a melodic explosion all allong the solo....for the next level you have to listen to Comfortably Numb, Stairway to heaven, Hotel California, among some others.
Masterpieces ❤
Still hadn’t been buried and you as well!Awesome to know genuinely good people are everywhere.
Yo dog❤
Hits different when you’re on a plane
4:10, 5:15
Discovering after 6 years in a couple that... i'm not a family man. I'm a free bird
Had a fight in my dorm last night while this was blasting in my earbuds. Best i've ever fought.
*fly to cayo perico*
Woodhouse , I want to get buried to this song..:
I heard this song in a Bluey short of Bluey and Bingo in their car flying off a cliff man loving Lynyrd Skynyrd and watching Bluey at the same time what a blast loving Southern rock and watching Australian fandom at the same time
Love Leonard Skinner. Rock on straight 🚒🔥

My mom and stepdad LITERALLY always play this song. Now it’s stuck in my head. This song is also the perfect song to listen to going from Southern California to either Phoenix Arizona or even Vegas
I just finish all the mission from GTA San Andreas (android) and after that I ride a bike and this masterpiece kicks in and then I drove my bike to area 51😂 and I got full wanted and the guitar solo part, that's the real fun begins😂

Song is slow and boring only lasted til 4:35 before turning it off. Wish they added a guitar solo or something
I saw Janice Joplin in concert in SF in 1969. It's not her singing voice that drew people to her it was the WAY she sang it full hearted! She poured out her love to the fans, and we returned it! She owned that audience. I was 21 yrs old that year, and it's STILL the best concert I ever went to! Her ending was so tragic!
브금:free bird
POV: me and the bois boutta fight aliens to save the entire world what we be blasting in are lambo:

Watching this on a plane pray for me
The first time I ever heard this song was while I was carpooling with a friend.  I'll always remember him saying, in a very casual tone as he drove along, "This is a good song to speed down the highway at 90 miles an hour to."
This whole comment section is rad. I love you guys!
To free bird

If I leave here tomorrow Would you still remember me? For I must be traveling on now 'Cause there's too many places I've got to see But if I stay here with you, girl Things just couldn't be the same 'Cause I'm as free as a bird now And this bird you cannot change Oh, oh, oh, oh And the bird you cannot change And this bird, you cannot change Lord knows, I can't change Bye-bye baby, it's been sweet love, yeah, yeah Though this feelin' I can't change But please don't take it so badly 'Cause Lord knows, I'm to blame But if I stay here with you, girl Things just couldn't be the same 'Cause I'm as free as a bird now And this bird you cannot change Oh, oh, oh, oh And the bird you cannot change And this bird, you cannot change Lord knows, I can't change Lord help me, I can't change Lord, I can't change Won't you fly high, free bird, yeah

This band died the day I was born this was to indicate my fate at birth($)<================== and all the shammmmmme you have done before I came remember the lord ========>(@) knows everything
A few years ago, I was working as a pizza delivery guy in a small town in the Northern US. I had an order to a motel, and while trying to find the motel room I needed to deliver to, I passed by the pool where a bunch of younger guys (early 20s) were swimming and relaxing, with a radio playing some song. That song ended, and the first bars to this song started playing. EVERYONE in the pool area got genuinely excited and started shouting and cheering.  Since then, I came up with the "Freebird Index", as a method to tell how "Southern" a place is. Go to a sufficiently populated group of random people, start playing this song, and gauge the reaction. The more excited the group gets, the more "Southern" the area is.
The greatest song that could possibly be used for the church fight scene in the Kingsmen movie! Incredible!!
😢 Fly high Jaik ❤ I miss you so much Son xx
4:55 I came here for this particular part😂❤

Brilliant!  Towards the end, the brilliant guitar sounds like a bird doing acrobatics, tumbling and circling rapidly in the air.
Free bird, or bohemian Rhapsody?

I typically listen to music with 1 headphone. That being said, if you can manage to sync that with another speaker like an echo or alexa at the same time, it makes for a great effect
My wife just called this song anxiety…. Send help 🤦‍♂️
You can’t stop the solo that’s why it fades out
anyone listening in 2025❤
It's sad many magas, and tik tokers ruined this beautiful song.
Actually this song safe my life, and I'm gonna tell you why!  I'm do it cocaine, I don't know if I wrote this good. But thanks to this I'm not doing that anymore bro

GTA San Andreas introduced me to this masterpiece. Didn’t know a game could lead me to a song that stays with me for life ❤
1 minute of aura farming in the beginning
The solo will make you wanna drive 200kph and jump a whole canyon in any car.
I don't have control of my actions if Free Bird is playing in the radio of my car
This song reminds me of a sub teacher who gets increasingly more mad with our class
WHAT THE F-CK IS A SPEEDOMETER?!

Probably the most used video in court to justify speeding tickets.

I was listening to this in traffic and right as I passed the accident and traffic ceased, the guitar solo began. 4:52
Fk!!!!! Simply Masterpiece!!! Hello from Texas June 2025.
Fking Masterpiece! Hello from Texas!
Fun fact: playing this about 20 seconds before the beginning of the second half of mission 19 in Ace Combat 7, the guitar solo kicks in right as the Arsenal Bird'a sheid goes down!
My favorite meme of this song is of a person's point of view driving around a town being hit by a tornado and the caption says something about "my bloodcells making their way to my brain through all the caffiene I drank".
I am completely and mentally stable driving on the interstate   Freebird starts playing:  Me:hmm maybe I should go a bit faster
61 years ago in a garage they beat it out some say it’s unreal man but Jacksonville had some others come out great stuff!!!!
Us Boomers had the Best Music 😅

Why did MAT in black truck get Rachel wards daughter last July during house hose and blow… yellow house on 601 Mat Gentry monopoly property where Rachel and JB was??For a fact because after yewa try and play threw her in the ditch with me (thanks because yes that’s better than going up) she L went to jail at county with me. Why did JB leave Cullman after that, the HALO thing? Been through worse here, there and yonder… who’s to JUDGE? Jury with no executioner. We are not sending folks through with Judges for Judgment. Sad honestly this is so far removed from REALITY. To BE determined NEVER just expected because some had already been in that and this date centuries before. NO mercy for anything in creation, not me, I, you, we, the planet or space. No hard feelings honestly. I don’t care enough

This song starts 15 seconds before the solo ..also for it's time ( i am 64years old  ) this Solo had the most incredible 'bass runs ' ,..i am a Blackman Originally from Brixton Market London U.K  .. please check out  Jimmi Hendrix " war heroes " ( polydor ) ..." three little bears" jimmi's ( failed attempt ) to play Reggae ..but it sounds ridiculously good ..

Me: types "Free Bird" into the search bar First suggestion: Free Bird Solo Me: Fools! The solo is only better if you listen to the whole song!
For me, this is better than Sweet Home Alabama.
One of the greatest guitar solos of all time
The solo pierced right through to the depths of my soul
Truly one of the songs of all time

Too busy rocking to these guitarist playing in unisance . Truly amazing.
One of my faves!
4:49 🔥
4:57 most epic monster jam freestyle intro ever
My sons outfit while this song plays: his most southern looking flannel shirt unbuttoned with a tank top underneath, most Freddie mercury looking sweatpants ( compared to the one Freddie wore in 1986) and a hat that you see at church
This song reminds me of my son’s struggle with the loss of his grandfather in 2022 and I have tried so many different things to try and help him, but it hasn’t worked, found out recently that he somtimes cry’s himself to sleep and that breaks my heart if anyone else has a problem with that too (kid wise) my almost 15 year old son understands. It’s so hard to see how much he has struggled since then and I can’t imagine how hard it is for him.

Noche de Verano, año 2005, una libreta llena de Trucos, una PS2 con su memory card y el GTA SA, y para ser mas exactos, una Freeway atravesando Bone County, Aldea Malvada Area 69 y El Castillo del Diablo, con el cielo morado y camino de San Fierro.... Como pasa el tiempo dios mio    Simplemente el mejor GTA jamas lanzado, top 1 para mi del mejor videojuego de cualquier plataforma en la Historia de las consolas
If I leave here tomorrow Would you still remember me? For I must be traveling on now 'Cause there's too many places I've got to see But if I stay here with you, girl Things just couldn't be the same 'Cause I'm as free as a bird now And this bird you cannot change Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh And the bird you cannot change And this bird you cannot change The Lord knows I can't change Bye-bye, baby, it's been a sweet love, yeah, yeah Though this feeling I can't change But please don't take it so badly 'Cause the Lord knows I'm to blame But if I stay here with you girl Things just couldn't be the same 'Cause I'm as free as a bird now And this bird you cannot change Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh And the bird you cannot change And this bird you cannot change The Lord knows I can't change Lord, help me, I can't change Lord, I can't change Won't you fly high, free bird, yeah
Holy Spirit stay with me all the days of my life through Christ our Lord Jesus Mercy Our Lady of Willesden Help in the Love of God our Father Amen 🙏💕
Seeing as it’s been almost 20 years since graduation I’m no longer upset that this is our senior song 🥹
Fly high my love in heaven
❤❤
Look at the car in background
Respect for a lost generation of musicians that flew the now considered a sign of hate "Confederate flag" at every single concert because before it was this generational tough hate sign it was a legacy of southern America pride.
Speed racer anyone?
For an old friend, Brad Evaschuk “see you on the other side “ ♥️🙏
After that nothing was the same😊 this is why I listen to freebird
A year after my it's been a while before my buddy passed away this is the song that you played at his funeral
My fiance my lady passed away after almost 8 years of knowing her she died of alcoholism next to me naked in her sleep I woke up and found her dead next to me naked ice cold no pause share blood on your face with a seizure she passed away 5 years now at the same time 2 days away from twin sisters birthday what's worse about that her mom passed away the same day she did May 1st May 3rd was heard in the twin sister's birthday and now that my uncle passed away after my aunt my aunt was 90 years old my uncle is 62 years old when he passed is there a retired from the where you worked you had a good pension going so thank God we're all alive still to this day
The Devil's Rejects brought me here
The length of the song
Sometimes i like to hear the song while looking at the solar sun and have a clock and focus on the number 7 .. 😊 and then the solo begins and we start to reminisce of all the hard work and suffering and people who were changed with a blessing and became part of the equality liberals movement and smile. The cheeks literally move by themselves and the smile is genuine..
Pretty great music.peace
Of admire innocent time, thanks!❤😂🎉😊

Lost my best friend  Ever a couple days ago  we  burned one or two to this  Going to miss ya Brysn S. 9:00

God bless the cats.

Fantásticos una canción muy energética y un extraordinario solo  de guitarra.  Canción iconica al escucharle me cambia el humor y me hace más libre.
Awesome song
Most People:  "God this song is so EPIC!"  Some People: "Man! I remember listening to this while running from the cops in San Andreas! Good times! ALL WE HAD TO DO WAS FOLLOW THE DAMN TRAIN CJ!!!!"  A large number of people from the Dallas/Fort Worth area in the early 1980's: "BOOOOOOO!!! FUCK YOU FREEBIRDS!!!!"  An Existing Yet Much Smaller Number Of People From The Same Time Period: "Them Von Erich boys are about to get their asses kicked... BADSTREET BABY, ANY TIME!!!!"
Yup 6–6-25
Reminds me of the Beatles 😢
4:49   the best part(i think)
Back forth
One of the best solos of all time
I graduated high school in the late 90s. While there, I joined a classic rock band. The other guys loved the music, and Free Bird became our signature song. Funny how that was almost 30 years ago that I graduated, because at the time, the music we were playing was 30 years old.
Listening to Freebird...my 5yr old " Hey what's that epic song?"
junee 2025 ...???!!!!
wow
They used their teacher’s name for the band  because they didn’t like him.
My favorite song if all time now i want to put my words to it please   If I leave her i will go insane again she will to and like before the storm wil be bad much worse then in2020 she is my world my heart my soul owwowowo this Byrd you changed but not my heart bc mine and her heart are the e now don't yall see i tried so hard for us yes she leaft bcif what they all did to her yes and the devil is crazy but im crazy over her more then anything.

Fuck these adds
4:42 is the best part
This song makes me speed.
Best song in the world just ordereddre it on vinyl
😢 wish they were still here
I have worked hard for many years to make the LGBT community to take possession of this song. There is no reason it should not be theirs, but a lot of them are afraid of it, it feels oppressive to them. It shouldn't. Freedom to be who you are is the heart of this song, but a lot of them don't see it that way. They see it as the song of the person who beat them down, but that's not his song, he has no ownership of it. Freedom does not oppress others, No free bird ever kept another bird from flying. I hope someday that the community understands, Freedom only lifts, it never oppresses, and there is so much beauty when freedom lifts more people to new heights.
😁😇

WHO’S KILLING THAT GUITAR GAWDDAMN
I just used this song during meditation. I also find the some lyrics quite accurate:  "But if I stay here with you, girl Things just couldn't be the same" (the soul talking to ego) "'Cause I'm as free as a bird now And this bird you cannot change" (you cannot change your soul) "Won't you fly high, free bird, yeah" And from this point on the music starts to rampage and to elevate (I imaged this bird/my soul flying and rising above myself, my city, continent, world and universe and reaching the peek  at around minute 8:00 when it reached the source and it filled my heart with light).. so many tears of joy.. I am at peace now.

I just realized mid song that 24 years ago today, May 26 2001, I flipped my truck in a peanut field the afternoon after I'd graduated high school that morning, but was completely sober and hadn't yet gone to any graduation parties. I was OK, but the truck was totaled. Went to a graduation party later still with cuts and bruises, my mom dropped me off and picked me up the next morning.   Good times, but I miss that truck.
WOAHH!!!!!!!

This guitar solo, the 2nd guitar solo from Pink Floyd's Comfortably Numb live at Pulse 1994 and Lionel's Richie's Running With the Night are probably my 3 favourite guitar solos, although Comfortably Numb's guitar solo is the absolute best guitar solo of all time imo.
Why not make it a 4min song...the same great lyrics, with this sick guitar solo throughout

The guitar literally says "Rock N' Roll" at 8:12 i can hear it 😭😭
I never thought I'd be saying this sentence but.....Joe Dirt 2 brought me here.   For a supposedly bad sequel, it will be remembered for one great and surprisingly moving scene, when Joe meets Lynyrd Skynard in the past and everything is fun, until one of the members talks about one day, they will buy their own airplane......😢😢

Wow. As I was listening to this I realized it was 50 years ago that my husband and I went to a Lynrd Skynrd concert in the Twin cities. We were 18 years old. My husband passed away 2 years ago. This was his song.
"Lord help me i can change"
Stairway to heaven  was my wedding song, my husband played guitar and sang it while recording on a cassette tape 1984 . Ty for a beautiful song.
If the Vikings had this song we'd all praying to Tyr right now.

This song means so much to me. I went to prison in 2020 and when they were transporting us from country jail to the actual prison and the prison was coming into view this song started playing. We were all joking around and trying to keep our spirits up and take our minds off the fact we were gonna be here for a couple years, then as we made it to the top of the hill the prison came into view at the same exact time that this fucking song came on. The whole bus went dead silent immediately, everyone fell silent and stared out the windows or down at the cuffs around their wrists and fetters around their ankle. The good vibes were crushed into oblivion, the depression that swept into the bus was suffocating, stunning even the hardest of criminals on the bus. One man had a tear roll down his face.  That shit hurt so bad. the absolute worst song to be playing while you’re shackled up driving through multiple fences at a maximum security facility.  As I was walking from the back of the bus to the front before getting off the song was around 4:43 and it really helped me shake off the emotions, leave my feelings on the bus and get myself war-ready.  The timing of the song and the prison coming into view and switching up as I was walking from the back of the bus to the front was absolutely perfect, like it was scene from a movie.  And it’s not like the transport officers played this song on purpose it was on the radio. That moment was so incredibly painful, yet so beautiful.  0/10 would not recommend.

Most people don’t know this but a guy named Joe help them with this song in a bar back in 1965. He also helped them come up with their name. I’ll never forget any of them. Joe had this crazy mullet and was convinced he was from the future.

I picked Leon Wilkeson up at his house on Ernest st. In riverside, jacksonville in 1996. I was 16 and the girl i liked's dad was high school buddies with him. He asked me to pick him up and bring him out with us to shoot pool. My green a%% picked him up in my black 88 mustang and he said DETOUR!!!, straight to "Whites Bar". A bar surrounded by barbed wire and cameras where the bartender was cleaning his shotgun on the bar when we walked thru the door. Then he made me pick up some shrimp from "Mary-annes golden fried chicken." Then we went to my girls house to get her and her dad. Went and shot a few games at "TJ's Bar". A few days later i get a call from Leon. I picked him up and brought him to my house where we proceded with a jam session. Two guitars rockin "Gimmie three steps" and "Tuesday's gone" Then he asked for a drink so i gave him all we had was blue curacao. He drank the whole bottle. Later my 20 year old, much more talented brother showed up and they started playing. Im 44 now and couldn't fully understand how bad-ass an experience i was having back then. RIP Leon.
Total San Andreas vibes coming here

Some one make an edit of freebird playing in the back ground
Me gusta el pitillo mojado
This came out in 1974 when I was 15, and from then on I always thought Ronnie Van Zandt was a rude, selfish, jerk.  "If I leave here tomorrow, Would you still remember me?"  Yes, she will remember what an a-hole you were.  "For I must be traveling on now, 'Cause there's too many places I've got to see" - you could take her with you, but naw, you used her and want to dump her.  "But if I stay here with you, girl, things just couldn't be the same" - well, yeah, they probably would be the same - you pretending to like the woman.  "'Cause I'm as free as a bird now, and this bird you cannot change," i.e. go to h*ll girl.  What a shmuck.  You could have told her when you met her that you were a free bird, but hey, details, detail, just use people, jerko.  "Bye-bye, baby, it's been a sweet love," - no, it wasn't love at all.  I have heard this song for 53 years, and have never liked his self-centered, misogynistic message.  If a woman wrote this about being a free bird, every man woul hate this song.  The God of Women got even with them.  Too bad the bird flew into a tree!  Guess you weren't a bird after all! :)

Fun fact: they named their band after a teacher who bullied them for being rednecks, and on this album name they actually wrote out his name: lehnerd skinerd(pronounced ‘leh-nerd’skin-nerd). W move.

Fuera de serie , este ritmo   contiene mucho rock 🤟 solo para los de buenos gustos
El mejor cover de la historia
Awesome.  Song
Once had a country band play this for me at a bar I worked at because I yelled it once in a while. Just kidding around. The lead singer and guitarist absolutely ripped the solo.  Walked around the bar with a wireless amp connection. Lost all he had to gambling. Even his lovely wife who I had the pleasure of keeping company as he played.
If you don't play air guitar when you listen to free bird, you aren't human 🎸
Be a dope way to go out to this solo with finger pistols cuz my background don’t check out…… that was a joke sorry I have a f up sense of humor 😂😂😂
When of the most fire exits to a movie with this playing might go watch devils rejects
So .. we were traveling and my son asked me to send it, he literally said "Dad send it"  just before, i did and reached 155mph in my Focus ST-3 before letting go xD .. We always talk about it, Epic !!
Always listening. Always ❤

Been to one of their concerts in Lafayette La Cajun Dome December 29,1999 and we were way up in the stands but couldn’t sit to their music so me and my cousin went in the stairwell to jam and a man came up to us and offers two front row center tickets, we didn’t believe it but he gave us each a comp front row center ticket. We grabbed the tickets and ran all the way there to the front row. Security asked to see our tickets and congratulated us. During the concert, the guitarist, Rickey Medlocke threw me his guitar pick , I picked it up and looked at him and he smiled and nodded his head at me. A moment I will never forget. I still have the comp ticket and the one we purchased and I still have the GUITAR PICK. I’ll never forget that night 26 years ago!!!!
Course!!
So  true

I am a writer of fan fiction. I am working on a sequel to a 40+ chapter story, and one of the scenes in the sequel will be a workout between my character and a character that I got permission to use before the author passed away. The workout will be done to three different songs, and the middle song WILL be FREEBIRD!
The church scene, Kingsman. That is all.

For I must be traveling on now 'Cause there's too many places I've got to see  But if I stay here with you, girl Things just couldn't be the same 'Cause I'm as free as a bird now And this bird you cannot change Oh, oh, oh, oh And the bird you cannot change And this bird you cannot change Lord knows I can't change Bye, bye, baby, it's been a sweet love, yeah, yeah Though this feeling I can't change But, please, don't take it so badly 'Cause Lord knows I'm to blame  But if I stay here with you, girl Things just couldn't be the same 'Cause I'm as free as a bird now And this bird you cannot change Oh, oh, oh, oh And the bird you cannot change And this bird you cannot change Lord knows I can't change Lord, help me, I can't change  Lord, I can't change Won't you fly high, free bird? Yeah

Sometime mid 80s, I was playing bass in a bluegrass band, and we had a New Year’s Eve gig in a truckstop bar on the Nevada/California border, out in the desert. We were picking away, and a guy pressed up against the stage and screamed FREEBIRD! We kept on playing some hillbilly tune, and pretty soon a half-full beer can bounced off the wall right next to my head. It was the highlight of the gig!
I'm in love with this song right now!
I am here!
Wow❤ 10/10
4:44 the best part
Yo why did I think this was in real life..
Yep i do!
It’s time 4:50

Oh man, this song takes me back to where I had to drive all the way from South Los Santos to San Fierro. Listening to this song on that magical journey it’s something you had to be there to experience it for yourself. If you know you know
It’s the end of the world and you’ve got enough time to blast ONE SONG while you go full tilt into oblivion. What are you going to listen to? FREE BIRD
4:43 the banger starts playing
Heard it in the background my whole life. 2025 I’m hearing it fully for the first time. What a master piece. What happened to music

Why do people keep saying anyone here in 2025 let me ask anyone still here 2026 2027 2028 , we will always still be here listening not fishing for likes

4:44 rock out part
And this Bird you cannot chain?  As in scripture which says something along the lines of "Those set free are free indeed" liken also to the movie world version of similar twisted concept "Free Guy" - Seems the one who wrote this song may have known chains of lust...
"Epic" is the word for this song!
And a Love that always must be
It's a forgiveness
The Wings of the Future only Soar

Fico impressionado como os americanos amam essa banda. Entendo, essa banda é espetácular mesmo❤
This song makes me proud to be an American...and I'm not even American.
🇧🇷🇺🇸
Can somebody like my comment so that everytime I get a notification I’ll listen to this master piece.
Whenever I hear this song I always think of what the members of Lynyrd Skynyrd would think if they were here today to see that one of their songs had not only become incredibly famous, but one of if not the perfect song and guitar solo for the most epic movie fight scenes ever filmed
Chieffo, Baker, Taughner. We operated on a different set of rules! 110 triangle st.   🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘.
Extremely sad song. So be nice every day.
Gym playlist? Anyone? 4:49

Ignoring all the memes, this is a really good song
Your ancestors said i just answered the last question to enter a period of understanding above them in their after existences. Being white and about your race sometimes makes you stuck as advice if you can access them. I can. I can actually access all ancestors but this ancestor in particular knew why youd have trouble winning internationally if you take down gangs instead of working with them. It was because of their connections around the world top and bottom connections underworld and viral connections working hand and hand. But instead its what the white gangs? I mean theyll fight with everyone doesnt mean they made all the connections
Any1 else dps Jeff the shark & have this song playing
❤
4:55 oh so good
I am!

Sure we have went anywhere, 1977 Oakland  77,000 fan heard these Alabama boys. You boys was the boom.😊
My girlfriend once said: If I leave you here tomorrow, would you still remember me Me: what's your name again, honey?
*"Do you know why i pulled you over?"* *"Why officer?"* *"You were going mach 1.6 in a 45."*  *"I don't care, free bird was playing." *"Sir that's 1.6 times the speed of sou-"*

*falls into the void 10 times* “Damn, what do I do? Wait…” *turns on Free Bird* *completes the ice boat racing track with ease*
5 minutos de mierda 🗿
*The moment you die, you see yourself walking down a long hallway for exactly 4 minutes and 55 seconds while "Free Bird"* *plays. At the end of the hallway are 2 doors: Heaven & Hell. If God decides to send you to Heaven, "Free Bird" stops and *Céline *Dion starts singing. But if you go to Hell... "Free Bird" keeps playing and the best riff in history begins.* *From now on, I'll be really bad... 😂*
Best concert ever philadelphia jfk
*my fight song*
One night was imagining a  dream for myself and I thought it's painful to think of a past just like John said from they might be giants, sometimes you can listen to the song and think , oh that's so painful to think of the past     4:55 is  the best part of the song free bird is a very good solo electric guitar ; isn't it like this comment if you agree with me     0:00-0:01 3:00-4:55 6:24-8:00 8:39-9:10  Bye have a great day everybody in the world and don't forget to listen to free bird bye !!!!!!

_So you're telling me I can use a machine gun on full auto?..._  -*yeah.. you can..*   _ok, perfect.._
I might be the only one but those memes and fight stuff has completely ruined this song for me. probably because I heard it so much. BUT my god I HATE that modernized version with the boost.
Love this takes me back to seventies Wishbone Ash Argus etc.
When free bird kicks in middle of police chase in Country in GTA SA.
Jika kalian pernah main guitar Hero ps2. Begitu nostalgia
Fun fact: the guitar solo slaps when played on a lute, so for any D&D fanatics, your bard can totally play it
I am 68 I listen to  this awesome group everyday . OMG they are still the bomb .
More.
For 50 years!  Still think if that plane didn't crash they would have been the greatest band of all time.
There will NEVER be another guitar solo this AMAZING again!
2025 in the year of Our Lord...I'M STILL A FREEBIRD...❤❤❤
Try this. On a high powered e bike. Through rush hour traffic. Live your best life.
Saw these guys in '77. Didn't have $ to get in, so I walked to where they were and and hung out outside. With about three songs left, the guards took pity on the few of us there and let us in... for Free Bird, and Sweet Home Alabama!
Thanks GTA san andreas 😢

Rock
✏️ describe the vibe
That solo doesn't beat comfortabley numb by pink floyd. Too repetious and floyds has so many different variants to the soko. It changes a lot. Where free bird is the same long repetative solo.
May I speak the obvious, one may not tangle with The Jason. Lest ye sea the light.

Isso só me lembra Grand theft auto SAN andreas

2025 and i still love these guys
Best moment of time 5:00 ever I like it
8:05 the moment I went all out Pete Townshend on my airguitar
It's ridiculous to me. I grew up listening to these 70s songs , born in late 80s. Classic radio would play songs like this to death. I'd want to listen to 90s and 2000s rock. But anytime around older people, they'd wanna play their stuff. Here I am now in 2025 and these old timer songs are just as soothing and pleasant and enjoyable to me as my own preferred music. Cats in the cradle, Mr. Brownstone, Time,  freebird and a dozen other great songs before I was born mean just as much as my favorite songs always have.
4:40 BEST PART

As someone who literally lives and breathes safety, defensive driving, and following the rules of the road….  For the love of God, do not play this song, specifically 4:55, while operating a motor vehicle. It is genuinely dangerous.

Em alguns momentos tudo o que precisamos é de um carro 6 válvulas turbo, um revólver, pensamentos instrusivos e free bird tocando para sentir que a vida possui algum sentido.

El mejor solo de guitarra de la historia
Sono italiano. Ho 38 anni. Ho conosciuto sto pezzo grazie ad un reel di un motoclista. MI SONO VENUTI I BRIVIDI AD ASCOLTARLA. ME NE SONO LETTERALEMNTE INNAMORATO. QUANDO  SI INCONTRA LA VERA "ARTE" QUESTE SONO LE SENSAZIONI CHE PROVOCA. LUNGA VITA AL ROCK AND ROLL.
simply sublime sweetness and light cant ever be bettered
This made me feel better
I was stationed at Ft Sam In San Antonio and used to go to Canton Lake to camp and swim.  W had a whole group that would go.  They would have bands perform, and they're was this one band that rocked!!!!! We loved them and they played all the best classic rock including this song.  Our group was always front anne center partying and dancing.  This was mid 90s. Fast forward, I'm deployed to Iraq and MWR had some entertainment for us.  A fabulous band playing classic rock.  IT WAS THE SAME BAND ALMOST 10 YEARS LATER! I was so stoked and went to talk to them, and they remembered our crazy group.  Epic!
What the main song should've been in the purge movie:
STEALL BALL RUN IS REAL
The more times I listen to this song the more I appreciate the first half of it, the solo goes hard don't get me wrong, but there's just something about the slow and melancholic rhythm that hits different
Gta San Andreas?

I really like phantom menace for its aesthetic. It combines both the original trilogy's puppetry and miniatures but also has the prequel trilogy's choreography and cgi

*The moment you die, you see yourself walking down a long hallway for exactly 4 minutes and 55 seconds while "Free Bird"* *plays. At the end of the hallway are 2 doors: Heaven & Hell. If God decides to send you to Heaven, "Free Bird" stops and* *Céline Dion starts singing. But if you go to Hell... "Free Bird" keeps playing and the best riff in history begins.* *From now on, I'll be really bad... 😂*
Anyone else in 2030?
To be honest I've came here because of Kingsman: The Secret Service church fights scene if it wasn't for the church fight scene with Colin Firth, I won't never known this masterpiece song :)

You get wise and tough or you die inside! Classic statement by you tonight...."the Not Family". My family in all directions is bizarre and frighteningly brilliant.... I just sledge them every 10 years for curiosity, last sledging I found my youngest sister was still alive inside, gosh,  so have left a thread for connection there. She cops it in my absence. Give you 10 out of 10 for this one Dude..... great vid!

USUALLY? When "people" "change"?? It happens SO "SLOW", that NO ONE besides THEMSELVES, ever NOTICES it!!!!!!!! Or, even "LOOKS" FOR.....OR.....AT...... IT!!!!!!!! SO,....WHENEVER, THEY "TAKE NOTICE"? THEY "THINK" IT A "FAST" OR "SUDDEN" ACTION!!!! NO GD BODY!!!! EVER!!!!!!!!..... "CHANGES" THAT GD "FAST"!! IF....AT ALL!!!!🙄
4:20 best part
Lynrd Skynrd......SOMETHING THE STATE OF "ALABAMA".....SHOULD.....BE.......VERY.........GD "PROUD" OF!!!!  This song was "introduced" to me? By a VERY "NOBLE" MEMBER OF THAT STATE,....which was truly, what, and who, I call a "FRIEND"!!!! 🫡
Am I the only one who thinks the first 5 seconds are similar beats to Money trees?
4:50
one of the best songs of all times you know
My mom was such a free spirit. She was so active and loved life. She loved to travel and explore and experience new things. When I was a teenager, she started having heath problems that resulted in her becoming disabled. It was heartbreaking to watch her once vibrant soul be confined to a wheelchair. To see the pain she was in every day that made it  difficult for her to leave her house, to sleep, to even shower. She passed away this past December at 57 years old. She loved 70s rock and roll. I like to think of her when I hear this song, that she didn’t belong in this world anymore. She’s a free bird in the afterlife, going and doing whatever she pleases with total freedom from physical limitations. Fly high, Mama. Love and miss you. 💕 Barb Ramirez, my forever guardian angel.
My dad loves this song
4:49
Sounds like lightning mcqueen music to me especially at 5:02
I'm still nodding to this like I've still got long hair... ridiculous 😮
Whos listening to these LEGENDS in 2025. ❤
I haven't stopped thinking about this song this week. It's been on my mind, even when I'm taking a shower or at work.
I will always remember the time we were travelling with my friends in my car through the route 40 in Patagonia, Argentina (our country). We were all really crazy singing this song, that car was fucking flying.
Anyone in 2030?
God Bless you ! Yes your husband is free of pain ! Thank you Jesus ! So is mine ! R.I.P Michael....

4:49 – This moment
I had this song as my husbands last song at his memorial. That is what he wanted. I'll miss him forever .
I remember driving on the bridge gta san andreas on sunset view and this song was on radio and i was driving
I wish this song was longer than it already is.
Holy crap this video almost has as many views as that guy who dips his face in sparkling water! It must be a good song, when did these people come out?
me and my boyfriend always play this in the when we on a date and play it on call or fortnite.
My uncle died a couple weeks ago and this is the song he requested😭😔

RIP to all the birds who died from bird flu! ....... Not sure what came over me to say that but I think someone "egged" me on!

I first heard this in 1983 and it never ceases be superb.
For some time I only listened to the "good part" - however the whole song is an experience, especially when You know what is coming - You are waiting the entire time for the bird to become free
Should be new national anthem
Sad of the members who died in that plane crash. This was a fantastic group

This song is the same song that played during the scene of Forest Gump when Jenny tries to commit suicide and the song symbolizes Jenny trying to free from her past of abuse and drugs.
What do want folks
DEVILS REJECTS. THEY. DID THAT,🦾💯👁️👁️💜💜💜💜
im 23, anyone else my age listening to this masterpiece?
published 2 years ago still being used. this shows us how good this song is
Free Bird Riff is Don Frye's anthem!! Pure American product
Back in the '70's, we KNEW what we wanted out of rock and our bands gave it to us!
You think these games look pretty good ? You don't put the bar very high for these kind of games do you
I remember when this song came out. My husband was stationed in Hawaii. We had several friends over & blasted the stereo. Military had nice stereos!!! What a time it was!!!
Bro this song went viral when the Dead Rails Roblox game was released...
I was in this band in 1974 and the main guy told me how to play the piano part.  Why do I remember that? It was a great time in college. So we played in a little concert that night. That was at San Diego State University in the good old days.
4:52  absolutly this part
Hasta 04:40 revisé la velocidad del video porque me aburrió. Luego viene una parte más interesante pero nada espectacular. En Argentina hay y hubo mejores bandas. Ejemplo: Vox Dei. Años 60 y 70 Luis Alberto Spinetta,  años 60; 70; y 80 Rata Blanca.
Gotta hear this on shrooms
OH MY GOD I FUCKING LOVE LYNYRD SKYNYRD!!!!
4:40 so I can play the drop quickly

The guitar solo...🤯 omg 🎸 🔥🏆🔥
Had a girlfriend of mine-we were singers together. Met a man and a lady in a small church in Denver over 40 years ago. He was an older man with a mustache- walked with a cain. Lady-don't remember hers. He said his name was Paul Welch, and that he was the soundman for Lynyrd Skynrd. Said he was in the plane wreck and survived. Never saw his name on the "One From The Road" album-and never sought it completely out that he was telling the truth-if he was-or if he had lived or died. Or was even what he claimed to be-and that what he said was true for himself. I do know they did and that Ronnie died, and backsingers Gaines( a lady with the most beautiful smile) and others did. Rossington, Collins, Powell lived. More on it I don't know. Other than-I love this band.

This takes me back to a time before the airplane crash and these guys were on every rock station.  It was a simpler time, not as many laws, 17 years old, drinking beer, playing pool, listening to skynyrd, hanging with my best friends who are ALL gone now. Great times, awesome memories,  I wouldn't trade it for the world!
Can I just have a whole song of the fast part.
Like I say, it's country. It's stone-cold Buck Owens style, then it bends. Would you call it a Country-Metal? And there's a Vietnam thing, too.  It's so warped into that particular personality. Like the Ronnie one. It's too far gone. I say it's a Country one against the grain. I say it's a new deal.
Somebody said this was the perfect song to play in the church, i played it and now am being based on a exorcism documentary 🤔😤

The number of likes and replies on every comments show how great this song is.
The fact that this has only 52 million views and the crap music of today can get a billion in a week makes me a little bitter....

This is the song that played while Jenny from the movie "Forrest Gump" was doing drugs.
Back in the day Stairway to Heaven used to win the 'best rock and roll song ever' contests on the radio all the time. F that. This song is better.

That FADE OUT: Legend has it, they’re still going at it to this day.
It was the night of September 16th 2020. I was driving in my 2001 C5 Z06. I was coming back from a date I had at the movies, the only time I had gone to the theater during the pandemic. I had just dropped my girlfriend (now wife) off at her girlfriend’s place. I was heading home. A few miles from my place, my corvette was impounded for exhibition of speed… but to this day I don’t have a single regret.   Guess what I was listening to?
6:32 pure unrelenting madness
6:19 that echo is so good
This will forever be my favorite song as I will play it at my funeral ❤

playing this in the car on the highway, is a death wish every time it happens. And considering how many times I've played this, the fact I'm still alive is a miracle 😂😂😂
I was about to die but this was playing in the background so I didn't.
Sums up exactly how I start my morning commute crusing at 60kph on 4th gear and then gradually move to 130+ at 6k+ rpm.

Talking about the solo is almost cliche at this point, but it sounds like a bird flying extremely fast... dodging both whats ahead and whats behind. Its almost sad.
This reminds me of the gta V shorts with free bird before I was 17

One of the most perfectly satanic songs ever recorded. Satan used them to blaspheme the gospel of Jesus Christ with the all the subtlety of the old serpent himself then spit them out. Most proclaiming Christians, including most ministers, are so tragically ignorant of God's word and the gospel of salvation that they'd be clueless regarding this statement.

I say Google is in trouble. But they don't see it coming... Just like Alan Collins when he crashed his Mercedes and bought a Honda rebel 250 to get around incognito. Jacksonville Florida before he crashed again and became a crippled in a wheelchair. The dog track on Jones Road is where I grew up every summer since 1967.

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh  -  And the bird you cannot change   And this bird you cannot change  -  Lord knows I can't change . Bye-bye, baby, it's been a sweet love, yeah-yeah  -  Though this feeling I can't change But, please, don't take it so badly  -  'Cause Lord knows I'm to blame But, if I stay here with you, girl  -  Things just couldn't be the same 'Cause I'm as free as a bird now  -  And this bird you cannot change . Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh And the bird you cannot change  -  And this bird you cannot change Lord knows I can't change  -  Lord, help me, I can't change Lord, I can't change  -  Won't you fly high, free bird, yeah .
Masterpiece of a song, party song, speeding song, you name it

A military aircraft had gear problems on landing, and as the plane was skidding down the tarmac the tower controller asked if they needed assistance. From the plane came this song in background and a laconic southern voice: 'Dunno- we ain't done crashin' yet.'

So you i heard you guys commit crimes? Have you heard elderich crimes which are considered the one of the highest level of crimes? If not then here you go, try to do *unspeakable things* and then you will be able to ascend to a elderich god status after that experiment we can use their *unspeakable things* as a way to enhance and get immortality now you can go and commit the crime, good luck. Wait did i kill her already?
I love the part when he says you’ll find yourself. This is truly America sound were the times were extraordinary in the 70s and 80s.

Not much a diesel pickup with a good stereo in it won't fix on a wide open desert highway.  Im shocked I still have a drivers license. The only thing better is an open range raised wild horse who takes care of me.
I always think of that scene in forest gump when I hear the guitar solo

What Jesus would play the most during the rapture if it happened during WW3:
It’s scientifically proven you can not drive the speed limit or under while listening to this
You're responsible for your own actions, but that speeding ticket was definitely Skynyrd's fault.

AMQ leen
The best guitar solo ever
The best ski song ever
Ahhhhhh... sweet release, back towards my childhood, not from ever listening to this song, but from relating it to my earliest memories. I cannot change. None of can after a certain point. We just need to "let go", but cannot because of societal expectations. We become our own greatest abusers, and shame constrains us. But this song soothes us into accepting our sins, and invites us to "let go"  And my mind clashes with itself into a beautifully enlightening turmoil.

Show this to the aliens so they know wassup when they land
4:43
As a European, Free Bird and Sweet home Alabama is the distillation of America. Or to be more realistic: They are the romanticized version of what I think being an American was like at that era.
Absolutely beautiful song❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
4:40 it starts here 🎉🎉🎉
👍
04:54 asi es.... a esta parte viniste, date campeón 🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟 fuuuck yeaaaa
Je mets cet chanson dans mon top 20
Things the 4:43 of this song reminds me of: 👉Church fight scene from The Kingsman 👉Risky sports videos 👉That one guy in his motorcycle with two macaws on each of his shoulders
This song goes everything
Led Zeppelin has a great song called Free Bird play Sweet Home Alabama what's your favorite songs
😢 good music my favorite song is Freebird

Mark Scott you are Free Bird 🕊️ I'll always remember you
My dog just died in my arms at home and this is my go to song! It can pertain to anyone if you know the meaning behind it!
Play it for The 2025 Super Bowl Champions The Philadelphia Eagles and Freebirds of Buddy Jack Roberts, Michael Purely Sexy Hayes , Terry Bam Bam Gordy & Necro Butcher
Some songs shift my soul, this one bangs it on the walls and ceiling until it’s free🦅
This song is so fire. Once everyone played it at the same time at school, so we had free bird blasting all day.
Its a long song. So for everyone, the good part starts at 0:00 and ends at 9:10
My fingers casually clicking PS2 Controllers while imagining playing Guitar Hero 2.
A 9 min song HOLY COW music was great in these days ❤ you bought an album you got your $ Worth

4:48 is the solo
Me
Recorded at Quinvy '70. Marlin Greene engineered. I was in the studio, sang on their audition that day using my songs. Part of "The Lost Tapes". Ronnie on bass, Leon couldn't make the trip. This is the track that got them signed to Capricorn. I was in the office when David Johnson played it for Phil Walden. He listened twice, got up, into his silver Lincoln, drove to Jacksonville and signed them.
Algum br em 2025?
Gta San andreas ❤
Gta San Andreas radio?
Кто тоже пришел из видео с лыжником?
It's such a sad tragedy what happened to the band in 1977 and afterwards. RIP guys, no more original members left.

Top 3 songs to listen too while working out 1. Free Bird 2. Free Bird 3. Free Bird on repeat
Great song ! Feb 7/25
When I was at the Corsicana airshow, they started this song as a plane ascended, then timed with the guitar solo. We got paratroopers.
The fact that how much of a power I suddenly get when one of the best guitar solo hits is unsolvable. I could solve millions of problems at the same time. Just allow me to listen to this song all through the every exam I take
4:40 kingsman time 🤘🏻
I am here after watching "The devils reject"..
Best song in gta sa (legend)
So beautiful!!! 2025 ROCK ON!!
Where the grave site is where my mother had her funeral

最高の曲です。
4:35
I had a caged bird and I set her free
If you’re country enough to yell “play some Skynyrd!” every time you hear a guitar, let me get a hell yeah!
Hell yes
This should be the soundtrack for the new doom
Death prevention vitamins

Why is no one saying that this song is in GTA San Andreas?
this song makes me feel like i could win an argument with my parents
The most dangerous song to listen to while driving
4:35 is the best

Not really into "southern" Rock, & slightly before my time a little bit,  but this band is so bad ass!  See good music prevails no matter  age, generation, & or style, genre.  There's a few others, like Marshall Tucker band etc that just have that it factor

What is the name for this version of freebird
Di film terminator 2 juga, saat scene t-1000 mengejar sarah di rumah sakit jiwa, ada sedikit kesalahan teknis yg dilakukan kru, seharusnya pintu jeruji bisa dibuka, namun karena dedikasinya, akhirnya aktor t-1000 melakukan improvisasi dengan mengubah badannya menjadi logam cair supaya bisa menembus pintu jerujinya
You know things are about to get real when this music starts playing
9 minutes just for one part time waste

If I leave here tomorrow Would you still remember me?  For I must be traveling on now 'Cause there's too many places I've got to see  But, if I stay here with you, girl Things just couldn't be the same  'Cause, I'm as free as a bird now And this bird you cannot change, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh  And the bird you cannot change And this bird you cannot change Lord knows I can't change  Bye-bye, baby, it's been a sweet love, yeah, yeah Though this feeling I can't change But, please, don't take it so badly 'Cause Lord knows I'm to blame  But, if I stay here with you, girl  Things just couldn't be the same 'Cause, I'm as free as a bird now And this bird you'll never change, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh  And the bird you cannot change And this bird you cannot change Lord knows I can't change Lord, help me, I can't cha-a-a-ange  Lord, I can't change Won't you fly h-i-i-igh, free bird, yeah

Nothing better than driving through the desert listening to K-DST. #TheDust
Still listen to this amazing song to this day.  One of those songs that time will never let it get to old lol  Wish we had music like this again
Jenny, go back home…
One of the most hypnotising, Deep, spiritual Rebel Song of the 70s. Missing so much this band and the outstanding Energy of the final Guitar part. Timeless masterpiece
Boring
hits harder than Thunderstruck when commiting war crimes
I was playing the solo whilst my friend was playing gta 5

Greatest of all time longlive the band still here 2025 rip Tim Halsey number 1 fan
RIP Martin "Tiger" Bech. One of the 14 victims of the Bourbon Street attack in New Orleans on Jan. 1st, 2025. This song was played, accidentally at his funeral...or was it??
Forrest Gump
Ronnie and Allen co-wrote this in their mid 20's. Mind boggling.
Highway patrol heard me playing this and tried to race me 🗣️🗣️🗣️
Tiger bech sent me here.
Gonna leave this comment for the great guy who sacrificed his life to push someone out of the way of that truck that took the life of the victims celebrating new years rest in peace brother this was his favorite song

Iam and I love it
One of the best ever
May all rest in peace
What was it like hearing the song for the 1st time in the 70's?
This reminds me of when the best part of the song was about to play we were doing partner jog, and then I ran at the right time when the best part hit at 4:54 of the song
When i die this will be the song
Anyone 2025?
テリーゴディのテーマ曲でも有りました！😂
4:45
This is a song: They remember me playing GTA San Andreas ❤❤
All I can say to that is....   DAYMMMM
"Real ones" know the "best part" doesn't hit the same if you don't let the song build the energy up to that point  How does this happen, leave me alone
2025 anyone?
Hai
One of my favorite. !! Let s get married 🎉😂
why is the song so bad until half way through?  couldn't they be a bit more consistent?
You drove well beyond 110 mph on a backroad to this at some point

Just so you know there's another place beyond, I've been there. You MUST serve your purpose here first though. It decides when!!! I had an alcohol OD and was dead twenty minutes??? In the ER! That happened at 15 and I'm 65 now. I live for It's purpose not mine.

Big w for lockheed
😮😮😮
welp now time to wait 11 months to play this on new years. Like I did with xenogenesis
👿
So weird that this song has become a meme again.  In the nineties the meme was ‘Play some Skynard man!’ Via Besvis and Butthead.  Just goes to show that great music never, ever dies 😁👍🏻
THE BEST GUITAR SOLO OF ALL TIME. FUCK YOU IF YOU THINK DIFFERENTLY. thank you for coming to my ted talk. 😘😘

Lynyrd Skynyrd is ‘Southern Rock’ at its finest.  I’m a graduate of The University of Alabama, and it’s an awesome feeling to attend an Alabama football home game, and ‘Sweet Home Alabama’ starts blasting on the sound system throughout the stadium.  Proverbs 3:5
All rise for Buicks and Free Bird. Lord, let the two never meet in populated areas.

Brings tears to my eyes... I feel like 20 years went by in a blink of an eye. I swear I feel like 2004 was yesterday. I'd give anything to be a carefree kid again.
GTA San Andreas anyone?👀🔥
They really were the kingsmen of the rock & roll golden circle‼️🎸🎶🎵🎶🎼🎧🎤🕯️🕊️🙏👍😎
….1/11/25....MOST IMPORTANT INFORMATION IN THE HISTORY OF MANKIND….Be sure to take the time to read this entire letter carefully, what you are seeing here are well studied and proven code systems....This is a case where the unknowns knew the fate of a species that was destined, and mind control magic or some other unknowns, named it accordingly for a message….This letter is written and posted by the author of ‘Alien Park And The 911 Code’....Folks, the bible’s GOSPEL always told us to GO SPELL words. Messages alien’s sent by names was emphasized with the plane crash of Jim Croce after he released the single “I Got A Name’ on 9/20 leaving Louisiana, on 72% of the year, and by the plane crash of Lynyrd Skynyrd going to Louisiana, 72 days from the end of year on 10/20, after they recorded ‘What’s Your Name.’ (Free Bird). Both using the Roswell crash date number 7/2 as a reference. We just never did, spell out name acronyms for messages. Even the names of alien manipulated talents, with songs that filled their heads. Now all words in the King James Bible as well as our language are acronyms, and are all apart of the their GO SPELL GOSPEL messages….I have been posting acronyms on Facebook in letters for about 8 years, hundreds and hundreds of pages, but I never revealed the secret acronym matrix system. If you have the correct words chosen, it will be proven by the relevant words in the matrix, and therefore their correct numbers, and therefore the correct bible scripture messages. As we will see in this following example…. ….Folks, I have made note of China’s atrocities, and their wrath of Covid19, but us white people have also had our atrocities, just look at what we did to the Passenger Pigeon. Where was our wrath? The last Passenger Pigeon died in a zoo in 1914, and in 1918 the biggest pandemic in recorded history was released. Pandemic, Plague, and Pestilence all begin with a P, and Passenger Pigeon and Parakeet do also….These birds were slaughtered even at their nesting colonies, netted, shot, and exterminated….  .....P-A-S-S-E-N-G-E-R-P-I-G-E-O-N....  ....Pandemic Angel Sends - Species Extinction Now Gets Extraterrestrial Revenge - Punishment Is Given Eating Of Net....  ….A=1….B=2…C=3….and so forth. Each row of numbers are added together creating a day number, and each day number is converted into a date number, and then the date numbers are added together, giving us a total number of days, starting on the first of the year, a proven well studied alien / angel code system…..         P - A - S - S - E - N - G - E -   R - P - I -  G - E - O - N….Day/Date       A   N   E   P   X   O    E   X     E   U   S    I   A    F    E = 170  6/19       N  G    N   E   T    W   T   T    V  N         V   T          T = 221   8/9       D   E    D   C   I           S   R    E    I          E   I             =   90  3/31       E   L     S   I   N                A    N   S         N  N            =  121   5/1      M               E  C                T     G  H              G            =    63   3/4       I                 S  T                E    E  M                            =    71  3/12       C                    I                 R         E                            =    35   2/4                             O                R         N                            =    47 2/16                             N                E         T                            =    39   2/8                                               S                                        =    19 1/19                                               T                                        =    20 1/20                                               R                                        =    18 1/18                                               I                                         =     9    1/9                                              A                                       =     1     1/1                                              L                                        =    12  1/12+                                                                 Side drop tower #  2203, 2203 days starting on the first of the year as always, a proven code system, falls on day number 12, (disciples) a important year number, when the Mayan Calendar came to an end, and month number of bleak December, year of Titanic disaster….But the only match I know is ‘Bee,’ should honey be our sweetener?....The introduced honey bee has been considered as being part of the Carolina Parakeet’s extinction….If we start on leap year, it falls on day 11: (bed), my BED, the only match known. The secret code based on number matches, as being alien communication was well studied, and is another story, as well as my crucified BED life….The first number match that started it all, which made me look for more were the two words that follow…. ….Language = 68 ….Alien code = 68 ….The words found in the above (seek and find) matrix are stunning, we see the word NET three times.…NET NET NET WE MEET - US IS SIN - PETS GOT PEN….A perfect matrix, too perfect….Sadly, as much as I love pets, we even see a anti caged pet message….2203 scriptures from the end of the King James Bible is 2 Cor 6:1, We then, as workers (hunters) together with him, beseech (to be weak, sick, afflicted) you also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain (trouble, wickedness)....A true statement, home run, for we sure were by the Spanish Flu in 1918, a hunter in beseech, with God’s grace….     This pandemic in 1918 spread so fast without the airline industry it had to be spread by birds, estimated death tolls varied, from 20 to 100 million people, 1918, 1-9-18, was the AIR year, A is the first letter I is the 9th letter and R is the 18th letter, 1-9-18….A-I-R, and it was spread through the air by birds for a bird’s revenge….CONCLUSIVE CASE CLOSED….The prime number has a fascinating bible scripture….      Pandemic Angel Sends - Species Extinction Now Gets Extraterrestrial Revenge - Punishment Is Given Eating Of Net = 1106, 1106 scriptures from the end of the KJB is Heb 3:1….WHEREFORE, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus.....Birds sing and fly, ‘Heavenly Calling’ professional hunters shot 50 thousands birds every day, put them in barrels, and loaded them on the trains, and sold them to restaurants in New York City. We will reconsider such types of ‘professions’ now indeed….1106 days starting on the first day of the year as always, also falls on day number 11: (bed.) The only match known, this takes us to Adam and Eve’s bed, and therefore the Judgment Day of today, WOW, two different code systems fell on day 11, my ‘BED’ the only word match known to = 11….China eating up all the Pangolins, and the African bushmeat trade, a continuous sinking ship, bottomless pit of extinctions, thus explaining all of our new viruses plaguing earth…. ….Folks, conclusive codes were found, stating without any doubt, that mankind was punished for what we did to the Passenger Pigeon and the Carolina Parakeet by the Spanish Flu in 1918 that killed tens of millions of people. Can you imagine what wrath punishment we are going to receive when we let the Northern Right Whales go extinct????? Well, we already have….They are dying out by boat strikes, and trap buoy rope entanglement…. ….W-U-H-A-N-V-I-R-U-S….Whales Unsaved Have Armageddon - Nigger Vessel Is Ramming Unsafe (Unslowed) Speed….We can also throw this into the flooding of New Orleans, where a boat rammed a dyke….D-Y-K-E…Deserved /….Death / You Kill Extinctions…. ….V-A-C-C-I-N-E….Vessels Allowed Catching Crab Is Nigger Entanglement….Two more perfect acronyms added to the list….Well, I hate to say it, but the wrath does help. For when animal lovers like me suffer mental anguish from never seeing these beautiful birds, I can know, that justice was served, because up to 100 million people died….And if we lose the Northern Right Whales, the people of the future can also, reflect on the 21 million who are already dead, and this is just the start of what may be coming by the ‘Arm ‘A’ Dead On’ Armageddon vaccine….Thanks to the internet, I was given the alarm, how could we wait so long till the last minute to try to save a magnificent whale?....In fact two more Bible and Koran acronyms were now found…. ….B-I-B-L-E….Bad Is Boat Line Entanglement…. ….K-O-R-A-N….Killing Ocean Ropes Are Niggers…. ….All lobster and crab traps are to be confiscated immediately in the Atlantic, and replaced gradually by the new equipment….But, realistically we need highly insulated boat motors in a specially marked fleet, to surround all remaining North Atlantic Right Whales from a non bothering distance, and have them under surveillance 24/7. All oncoming boats will see these boats, even at night by their radar and can steer clear of the boats and thus the whales. All buoy ropes in the whales path will be confiscated making all the crabbers use the new technologies….Due to the urgency, I had to reveal the conclusive fact, that up to 100 million people were killed by the alien angels on the AIR year, for what we did, at least in part to two species of birds, send a list of messages at once….Get involved, all of our lives are at risk, if we keep sticking our heads in the sand, not protecting our wildlife, and end deforestation….This letter was compiled, with additional findings, today on my birthday, 4/29/24 and revised today on 1/11/25, 1/12/25….Share these secret code systems, which is a major part of the opening of the seventh seal, spread the word....Till we know more….

Me
2:30 AM USA It's the guitar solo setting me off and the inner free-bird inside that drives me at 64 years old. I've hiked the Colorado Rocky Mountains, solitude, learning to "pause" in my life and realizing we are all the same. Find my adventures each day, living love and acceptance by flying high above negativity and bogus rules mostly self imposed. Ciao. ☮

Do not listen to it while driving. It’s injurious to health.
I finally found that song I wanted
01/07/25
"You know, sometimes life feels like a river. We're all just passengers, drifting along, carried by the current. Sometimes the current's gentle, sometimes it's a raging torrent. We cling to the memories, the good times, the bad times, the loves we've lost, the dreams we've chased. We try to find our own rhythm, our own way to navigate the waters. But sometimes, you just gotta let go, let the current just take you and find out where it takes you. Spread your wings, like that eagle in the sky. Soar above the troubles, above the fears, above the limitations. Feel the wind beneath your wings, the freedom of the open sky, the freedom of the wide spaces. That's what this song is about. It's about finding your own freedom, your own path, no matter what life throws your way. So let's raise a glass to freedom, to the open road, to the spirit that refuses to be broken. And now, for you, 'Free Bird'."
USA HOCKEY BABY!!! WOOOOO

Who is here 2025?🤣🤣🤣🤣
In my first motorcycle accident that occurred on December 23, 2023, I was listening to this song on my helmet. I had the idea of ​​putting the cell phone to one side of my ear and playing it. I was so high that I couldn't make the turn right when I was on the ground. I crashed a Royal Enfield 650, it was my first bike. Now I have a Kawasaki Zx6r, God help me, because I'm drunk again going to the same corner with my cell phone on my helmet with the same music.

The US junior (under-20) hockey team has made this their goal-scoring celebration song for the current (late Dec. 2024) tournament!  Naturally, they're playing the part where the guitar solo starts!
it's incredible that every time we hear this music we associate it with fighter jets and fast cars
Turn it above max!!!

My friends and I were hanging out at a roadside stall, suddenly a gang of gangsters carrying sharp weapons approached us to cause trouble. My friends and I were not afraid even though they  Outnumbered but still fighting them like they are fearless😂 (I'm from Indonesia, and I played this song when the fight first started, by the way this is real)
I like the 🎸 BGM so much 4:55

The only case I know of a song with a plot twist 😂
Los 4,55 minutos es un ritmo muy melódico, tal deberian haber pensado eliminar esa parte para hacerla más pontente como es el final del tema.
My mothers funeral psalms/ songs she didn't understand it my journey
Losing eveything and everyone and having no love cant say ots not been totally devastating but when i think about what ive already overcome throughout my life this year all my fears have came true and more theres nothing im afraid of now ive went through eveything and im totslly alone except my haters hanging round in the background this song reminds me of flying free high above all the bs amd my life and situation being normal instead of filled with all pain and sadness music is my therapy i have survived so many things and vented my emotions through the songs i listen to

The film "Devil Rejects" brought me here
At 115 pounds holding the tank with my knees and ripping pasti 175mph on my Gixer750srad,the only thing that snapped me out was the guages getting blurred by the colours or the Science id dropped.Freebird blasting in my earphones,then realising it was in some way an Equation and the blurred guages was my eyeballs rattling in their sockets....Its like how the earth was created.Peace-Love and all that shite......I wish i never shut off...ive felt a coward ever since!!!!
Was blessed to have seen these boys the summer of 1977 in Chicago. July weather,  hotter than hell that day, I was 18, thought I was invincible and had the world at my feet. At least I thought I did. Things didn’t quite work out like I hoped. The boy I was with was killed 6 years later by a drunk driver,  college degree I earned wasn’t worth the paper it was printed on. Had a hard time getting good employment and because I didn’t play office politics, never became the person I thought I was going to become. Then, both parents became ill with cancers and heart disease, with both eventually developing Alzheimer’s so I was the one to be their only caregiver. I gave up my life and dreams to care for them so they wouldn’t end up in a nursing home to be abused. When I heard 3 months later in October of 1977, the plane crash that took 3 lives from the band and injured the rest of the members, that hit me hard. I didn’t know why I was so sad and upset about people I didn’t know. It took awhile to get through the shock of loss, but  I think it was the universe’s way of warning me that things don’t always turn out like you planned for your life. I have  great memories from that day and the music of an era that will never happen again. Live like every day is your last and just keep swimming upstream.
Ly-nerd sky-nerd
There's a mission in a video game that would fit this it so well

The song that never bloody ends and that no one should yell out in a crowd in a crowded dive bar live music scenario. Cheers boyos, we shall never stop listening to this song, at least I hope.

Who in 2024?
The beginning of this song not only touches my heart but also my mind and makes me fly back to Europe to 1978 in France😢. Another eternal song of my list...
Ich habe um 24Uhr Geburtstag und ich würde mir wünschen das dieses Lied zu meiner Trauer (Wo alle tanzen und glücklich sind) gespielt wird! Es dauert auch nicht mehr lange also etwas Geduld!😂😂😂

Grand Theft Auto San Andreas

4 and a half minutes of solo is for me completing the whole nürburgring in my beater)
My top Southern Rock, Classic Rock song of the Soundtrack of my life! Right?! 50 years ago I was 11, and was backstage at their show in St. Louis, Mo. Never forget it! My Aunt was working for the production company, so I was able to get to meet the band. Ronnie Van Zant was like the coolest big brother ever. Rode in the limo and walked in with the band. First concert, best concert!
8:13 that transition blows me away every time!
Sweeettt jessuuuuuss yeaaahhhh 🙏☺
From 4:34 or 4:35, whatever you like
Freebird drones UFO 👾👽👾👽👾👽 i can dig that. ❤✌️🎶🎧💯🤔😅
Almost crashed my car countless times. Almost killed all 5 of us TWICE. But anytime this song comes on. Everybody leaving my car fucking sick. Everybody can drive straight and fast on this song. I prefer to drive fast while drifting narrow roads, i prefer to do crazy shit i cant explain. Everytime until the solo i drive like grandpa. Everyone who passes me. I’ll see them again when the solo comes. Meh they’ll see me. I cant see cars that good driving 170km/h in a 30km/h zone…
I always love this song when it plays on the k dst radio channel in gta san andreas, when this song plays i will never skip it. Ahh such good memories
6:57 Neste momento tenho vontade de pular de uma montanha com Wingsuit
Someone on a Whatapp group mentioned that they were listening to this today, so I came here to have a listen. It's not my era, but I'm impressed so far.
I would spend years to learn guitar, just to play this one song
San andreas memories😊

The theme song for the F-15 Eagle.
It is ok played like this, but I got the true feeling of the version @the old grey whistle test performance in london, england. It sounded as powerful as a love song as The Titanic

The solo is too long, I don't like over 1 minute solos, yes probably a little break with a small piece with lyrics could be better.

My first boyfriend died by his own hand a few weeks ago. We were 12 in 1982, boy did he love this song. He was my first kiss; the first boy I spent the night with; the first boy I saw the sunrise with; the first boy whose hand I held; the first boy who broke my heart. It’s been 40 years since I’ve talked to him, our lives went very separate ways. And now, he is truly a Free Bird. I hope he is finally happy, I hope the demons didn’t follow him. I hope he is out of his pain. I will always regret not seeing him again. Always. ❤ BKSC 4ver babe.
If u listening this, you are a free bird

Whos here dec 2024🙈
Wow i saw a tees Free Bird concert
And yet, despite everything. Shit changed again, a new perspective in the face of new challenges. But deep down inside can I conjour the the alchemy to bring forth something different than all before?
MOST OVERHYPED and  OVER PLAYED SONG OF ALL TIME. PERIOD.
i just play GTA 6 and now a radio is playing a radio (mod)
I remember this song in gta ps2 😂
(Pronounced 'Lĕh-'nérd 'Skin-'nérd).
I miss my dad evwryday my heart gets that feeling knowing that my father will forever ever be my shadow... I miss him daily 2021 is huge event in my life , i miss him always...❤❤❤❤❤
SEND THE EGALE
If you're gonna get fucked up, at least do it to this song. Make it worth it.
December 2024 anyone? 😅
I'm always seeing Jennyiiii on the balcony, when the guitar solo starts.
"Free Bird," with its themes of freedom and escape, undoubtedly resonated with many Vietnam War veterans who faced immense challenges upon returning home. The song's powerful guitar solo and poignant lyrics could offer a momentary sense of solace and liberation as they dealt with their pain and sought comfort on the open road. It should never be trivialized as a meme. Van Zandt and others lost their lives when the song propelled them to iconic status—a status they will forever hold. Released on their debut album in 1973, they passed away just as they were beginning to enjoy the fame it brought them, never fully realizing the impact this song would have on their fans and other bands and future generations should treat it the same.
It sucks
18 years old in High school, driving down I-285 in Atlanta at 2 AM. Headed home after a date with my cheerleader girlfriend, in my red 1968 Pontiac Firebird. By the time the guitar solo hit I was at 110 mph with speakers about to blow out from sheer volume. It’s been downhill ever since.
I defeated Consort Radahn with this music playing in the background. Nobody knows how I feel right now
HELL YE-🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅
This the song i listened to first shroom trip
Reminds me of my teenage years. Definitely on of the most epic songs ever.
"There is nothing wrong with being a crow. When you compare them to the poor caged birds that have forgotten to fly, crows are much better. Being a crow is good enough for me."  - Bouya Harumichi (Crows)

If you listen to this while driving, there is a 110% chance your vehicle will morph into a beat up pickup truck, and an entire state's worth of law enforcement will chase after you as you drive faster than you ever thought possible. You will either escape, or a cliff will form in front of you to drive off of, but you will never get caught. True story.
Gta San Andreas K-DST the good old days.
But your honour...Free Bird was playing.....

Those lyrics - "If I leave here tomorrow, would you still remember me" - breaks my heart knowing that was just a few months before the plane crash 💔 And not only that.  According to former bandmate Artimus Pyle and family members, Ronnie Van Zant frequently discussed his mortality. Pyle recalls a moment when Lynyrd Skynyrd was in Japan: "Ronnie and I were in Tokyo, Japan, and Ronnie told me that he would never live to see thirty and that he would go out with his boots on, in other words, on the road. I said, 'Ronnie, don't talk like that,' but the man knew his destiny.] Van Zant's father, Lacy, said, "He said to me many times, 'Daddy, I'll never be 30 years old.' I said, 'Why are you talking this junk? You will never be 30 years old?' and he said, 'Daddy, that's my limit.' " Van Zant's father later noted that, "God was a jealous god. Taking him for reasons I don't know. Ex-bandmate Ed King also reported hearing Van Zant saying he would never live to be 30, saying Van Zant said it so often that he "had gotten sick of hearing it". Lynyrd Skynyrd backup singer JoJo Billingsley recalled that Van Zant had begun referring to himself as "The Mississippi Kid" in the months before his death despite being born and raised in Florida. She noted that, eerily, Van Zant's only connection to Mississippi was that he would ultimately die there.  His death was just meant to be... It's seriously f#%@!ked up when you think about it.

This was my dad's favorite song before he passed and now it's my infant's favorite song and I think he'd be proud 💜

If a song plays on YouTube and nobody's there to ask "is anyone still here" does it make a sound?
Love this song. Everytime I hear it I always think of the end of The Devil's Rejects.
I will always love you. ...but you will never be "more"      - "dad"🫂 🐕‍🦺😞

November 2024 😂❤
Buena música para esperar el fin del mundo
This song is everything. Top 3 all time favorite songs. Makes me think of my grandpa. ❤❤❤
The Devil's Rejects is how I know this song haha. Such a good song, hopefully it'll forever be remembered.
I've been cutting some sorta scaly boogin out of my head with a kitchen knife (do not attempt, I have a very particular set of skills) to this song for twelve months now.  And I'm winning, insofar as one can in a situation like this.   I credit Lynard Skynard with helping to save my life, and freebird with being a warcry fierce enough to make whatever it was eating me fear my very blood.   If you're ever touring Brisbane I'll come bring you swords and horns.  I hope skynard is still around when I'm old and crusty.  I hope the band lasts a thousand years.
Here before somone says "whos here in 2024/2025+"
Essa música só me faz lembrar do gta san andreas 😢

4 minutes and 46 seconds in for the solo. Devil Rejects was my favourite which used this song as the ending
Как сказал герой Бушеми в фильме Воздушная тюрьма, странно, что мы слушаем в самолете групу, солист которой погиб в авиакатастрофе.

Ill comment this on here because it was too sick not to shed a tear to it because it was too perfect. On junkyard digs i cant remember his name but he had a Ford ranger that sat for years till he finally found a trans to put in it. So he finally pulled it from the weeds and put power to it hit the radio and the solo to free bird started... Like for me writing this comment now.... Too perfect and as a car guy that gave me a tear, the ford wanted to live.
Die Nummer endete mit den Sätzen er gab Gas und fuhr mit 180mh in die Leitplanke wir fanden in im zertrümmertem auto er lächelte das Radio spielte lynyrd skynyrd😁👍

"So hail Satan, and have a lovely day Madame"
This song on kingsman
I'm always the guy to yell FREEBIRD at shows, sometimes unironically hahaha

Fuc🎉awesome close your eyes and release yourself
I actually heard this song that evening after my divorce was finalized
I recently saw this band with zztop here in corpus christi texas been a few months what a concert
it's no Wonderwall but it sounds like it would be decent on kareoke if you were pissed up and bored    *puts tin hat on , fixes bayonet*
As a Native American. Fuck everything else. This is the USA's national anthem. Fuck the racism , this or that. As a Native , ill proudly wave a southern flag, high and proud . So much hate and division. This will always be the American national anthem. The band members couldve been racist as shit but after experiencing the best guitar solo ever , i dont even fucking care. They are national treasures. Red, white and fucking blue. ❤
Is there GTA SA players?
POV: you are on the lift hill of a rollercoaster than this song starts playing in your head
POV you are switching to Trevor and he is in his car

That's that "FREEEEEEE BIIIIIRRRD!!!" Shit right there 😂
Driving on a high way and increasing your speed as the beat goes
If you love Freebird, you should treat yourself to a listen to Ramble Tamble by CCR. I’m a lover of this track but Ramble Tamble is like listening to Freebird on something special 😅

This video only having 40M views is criminal half of those are just me
'' Dad, why do you listen to this song, we are not even American.''  '' Come here son, let me tell you a story, of the greatest song ever written. '' '' It all started with this amazing group of random souls brought together across thousands of miles across this tiny rock, in this intergalactic ocean, we are but a drop. Every once in a while a Ripple is created that echoes and shatters across the surface of the planet, breaking through time and space and language. Every once in a while you learn how to get high, from a gradual incremental hit to a full throttle gas pedal smashed into the fucking carpet ride, next thing you know your down the motor way, red lining the engine, bouncing the needle like its on a trampoline. And then it happens, you meet another soul who delights and revels in the same utter chaos that your soul cries out for. In that moment of utter and crazy high, something primordial sparks and your set on a journey that neither you nor she planned for.  We don't need to be American to enjoy the best song ever written, that's the beauty and power of this song. Learn to be happy and love your neighbour, that's the most we can expect for in this ride that is life.
it's mine
"I'm a Catholic whore, currently enjoying congress out of wedlock with my black, jewish boyfriend who works at a military abortion clinic. So Hail Satan, and have a lovely afternoon madam."  - Harry "Galahad" Hart

October 23, 2024 I leave my mark
One night , when this album first came out, a hunter friend invited me over to cook up & eat a mess of quail he and  his brother had shot that day.  Put this song on as I was frying em. I was not amused....
When I was 16 in 1973 I got a complication LP with several bands looking to get discovered. Free Bird was on that LP. From that day on Skynyrd has been my & most of my friends GOAT.. My best friend Pat Haley & I saw Skynyrd ever trip through Dallas  until 78 MY friend died in a small plane crash in 83. I saw the Skynyrd tribute band in 2008 in West Wendower NV. Rest in Peace 😂😢😂 I'm 66 now retired in the Philippines. ❤❤❤Skynyrd FOREVER...
I got this from a commercial… and I love it

I'm here 2029, EU & USA no longer exist. They're now democratic people's soviet republic states of china, iran, korea & russia.   Uk still exists, even dictators like culture, decent films & music but without Weinstein/diddy characters & need corrupt political & financial systems to launder their cash. For uk to not be punished for being allied to usa  liz truss was put permanently in charge.   Part of Israel is Isis caliphate, rest is recovered Palestian lands. Jewish people can live in relative carnage in gaza, but aren't supplied with anything to rebuild it, they can work if they want food - but they're happy - they're the chosen people, in their homeland. Palestine reenacts war in Gaza, nightly, using su- 75 multi role jets.   Ukraine beat russia & N Korea, then became a neutral, pacifist country - very rich from scrap metal, spare parts for Soviet armoured vehicles & the rare earth minerals it discovered in the Donbass.. Eu & usa asked them for help fighting off russia, iran, unified Korea & china. Ukraine sent plasters,  antiseptic cream & bandages in first few weeks, then uniforms & helmets in first 3 months, but promised tanks in 2 years, jets in 3 years so long as they didn't use them on russian, korean, iranian or chinese territory. But after 3 months   usa & eu had no land of their own left, so ukraine couldn't keep its promise. It sends aid, but thats usually stolen by the african owners that Putin enslaved them to. Trump is still in charge, but rules from the comfort of Moscow where Putin's scientists are close to perfecting a process to reverse ageing. Putin has macron servicing wealthy sheikhs Puff diddy style in the middle east. Hilary Clinton is doing something similar on a tour of Soviet  prisons & gulags.

My rock n roll legend of a dad passed April 4th 2024. So sudden, so fast. Stubborn bastard refused to go to the doctor even though he had textbook leukemia symptoms. But he was always this way about going to the doctors. I suppose it was fitting for him to go this way I guess? All this just to get out of a doctors appointment. Fell in the bathroom after a hemorrhagic stroke due to one of the many brain hematomas full of blood bursting and hit the door so hard. He was lost the moment that one hematoma popped. Only one eye reacted. They did the stroke tests hold up 2 fingers smile try to talk. He barely managed they said but by the time they got to the hospital he was totally unresponsive and tubed. I didn't even get to give him a hand squeeze before he went out. I know they can hear you as they die but i wanted a hug. I told him i loved him i played black diamond for him made jokes about stuff. I pissed and shit myself. My legs were shaking. Why him, why now. My useless crippled ass cant do this. How am i gonna take care of stuff when mom dies? After all he taught me im just a lazy fucking failure. I cant stop spending money. I want to save but i just dont do it. Why. I have a 4 year old son he practically worshipped. Given my shy/reclusive nature and he and mom had me in their 30s he never thought hed get to be a papaw. God im just living. Thats it. I cant work due to genetic issues and the government hardly cares to get my disability case moving. What the fuck is the point of me existing just to disappoint and fail the man who taught me everything. What the fuck is the point of me dying just to go show him what a failure i am. The meds make me so tired i just cant get iut of bed in the morning its so hard. Doing anything hurts. I run out of breath so easy. Im just a drain on the resources he worked so hard to cultivate so i could live comfortably. Someone please fix me. Bring him back give him a child who actually contributes to society. Im so fucking useless. I just want the pain to go away god someone please fix me i hate living. Why am i tirning this into self loathjng instead of honoring him. Im going to sleep now. I wish i didn't have to wake up anymore. But i guess ive got to try and be less of a failure so when i die i dont have to disappoint him anymore than i already have.
A qui los que vinieron por el vídeo del toro 😂😂❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Guess what? My newly created AI bot recommended me to this song when I asked him to sing a song from the 80s..😅

ME AS A STRICTLY RAP ONLY PERSON…. I HIGHLY APPROVE OF THIS GUITAR SOLO 😂❤💪🏽
As the guitar solos soar like free spirits, I’m reminded that music transcends time and place. Lynyrd Skynyrd, you’ve given us an anthem that defies gravity—like a phoenix rising from the ashes. 🦅✨ To Ronnie Van Zant, guitarist and vocalist Steve Gaines, backing vocalist Cassie Gaines (Steve’s older sister) legends who flew too close to the sun—may your guitars forever echo in the winds of freedom. 🎶🕊No matter how many times I listen to 'Free Bird,' it still hits me the same way—like freedom, loss, and hope all rolled into one. The guitar solo is like taking a journey through the soul, and the lyrics remind us of the universal desire to break free and fly. This is more than a song; it's an anthem for anyone who's ever felt trapped but knew they were destined for something more.

4:43 tryna find the meme
My wife thinks this song sucks, the irony
I have to be careful not to listen to this song too much.  Whenever I listen to it I want to quit the job, the family, the social media and all the other mountains of bs in this insane modern world - leave it all behind.

GTA san Adreas peak moment
I MISS PLAYING GUITAR HERO!🥹🥹
War thunder US main's theme song
K-DST GTA SAN ANDREAS you can find this song.
I've been searching for song to put on my seasonal playlist. I started at Time of the Season by the Zombies & have kinda just been skipping around from there.. I'm sooo happy I came across this song & stayed to hear it play out. Earlier in the song, I'm thinking "Beautiful song.. but it doesn't really fit the vibe I'm in the season". But I kept feeling like I heard this song somewhere. It finally clicked! I heard this song in Forrest Gump when Jenny was out on the ledge, contemplating jumping.  I only recognized it because watching the movie as a kid, I specifically loved the guitar in the background on that part. I never heard the whole song until now.. It's weird because I'm happy to have found it. On the other hand, I've missed out on a great song that was right in my face for so long 😩♥️
Free bird starts playing [Ogerpon starts casually spinning]

These were the times  drinking my bestmates
Today is a great day
Who's here because of San Andreas? :d
I read opinions calling this the "best guitar solo of all time" here. I don't like the notion of "best solo". This song and its solos are iconic and very good, by all means, but everybody has their own feeling about the guitar solo(s) they like best, and from a purely technical point of view, there are certainly better ones. But speed is not everything, feeling, the interplay like here, and other factors. As for me, there are quite a few solos by Thin Lizzy guitarists that I would prefer, but this is only my personal opinion, of course. So let's put down these "the best... of all time" claims, they are pointless.
you playing gta san andreas and in the radio the put this song
song is so greaaaaat

That tempo change is awesome
Seems like i try so hard and never get anywhere and i never get a chance to be me at all. Feel so smothered and buried. Know mom and dad want tye best for me its hard bye bye baby sweet love thats the sad part.
The beginning is what sounds like freedom to me.
Everytime I hear this song I remember mom saying I'm setting you free! I can't wait I'm gonna be soaring like an eagle high above all this evil and hatred! Evrytime I hear this song I remember all the disappointment and the people that hurt me and let me down. Things just couldn't be the same if I stayed here that's for sure. To .much to overcome and to much was done to me entirely to much!
PLAY FREEBIRD !!!!!!!!!!!!!
I’m sorry Lily ✌️✌️🙏🏻🙏🏻❤️❤️❤️Please know I love You an always will do 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻

4:43 best part
This is our ferkin song
Van Zant claimed it only took him 3 minutes to write "Freebird". So it took him 1/3 the time to write the song as to play it, somehow :D
This song is a direct contradiction to Simple Man.

🇺🇸America
Dear Australian government.   Trying to tell me my only chance at having worth as a person was to join the air force to fight the murder drones in the quest for Siberian soil {ultimately}  But asking why people are sucking down "mustard gas*cherry flavor "?  A million units were on the market a day after Johnny Depp oops accidentallyd advertised them as a dangerous stage prop.  And you let it go because money.   And I had a stroke on new year's  thanks for that.   I have trouble on public transportation because the fumes affect my blood pressure and they're in the air conditioning and on peoples clothes.   Nice trick with the foreign students and net immigration targets.  Gotta keep the fleeing Yankees under wraps and in existing housing.   Which is so scarce.  What, like 5 million people in Queensland and a 500 billion gdp per annum.    And Homelessness? Do we need to put a breathalyzer on the house and Senate chambers to get some basic civic duty happening.?  Kind regards   Johnny Austin

@everyone : If you diverge from this behaviour you will be determined a spammer and anyone like you will never know you exist, therefore mental health of the divergent becomes increasingly paranoid and suicide rates go up.. But such is life, I return to free speech zones. Certain people do not want complicated and hard to navigate things existing, because they can say 'crazy' 'spam' or 'nonesense'.. How they claim to like freebird is beyond me. (not directed at the owners) just food for those who hate difference, but proclaim freedom is right. (what I posted that was interpreted as dislikable was an opinion and it actually meant something in and of itself which some can relate to but are never permitted to discuss without hatred because it looks hostile to assert you are the symbolic victim of your own argument, when in fact it is merely a viewpoint which is only visible in its true form to those very same victims, in short, often a liar or spammer, or apparent bigot is actually siding with the victim if the logic stands on its own despite the victim supposedly being the target according to the 'normal' who do not think in vast complicated progressions that are not always put into words when the post is made because it is a conclusion of thought not the process) I ask you to try to find what is right about a post before calling names and demanding removal. It should be pretty obvious to anyone with a brain that forest gump is trying to learn therefore not ignorant, so just because you assume I am saying he is by stating 'ignorance is a flaw' and posting a video I like of gump, is no reason not to ponder what I might actually mean... Ignorance is a flaw, Gump is clearly aware of that in all his efforts, how could anyone assume it is 'spam' to assert these two ideas at once, when alone they each mean something not spam. (freebird played in forest gump, ignorance is the enemy of freedom, these directly relate to this video). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13OoNe51Vx8  Anyone still think I am spamming?  Ignorance, isn't it widespread and are the real thinkers allowed to express anything amidst you?  Life doesn't go away because you have an insult to throw at anyone different when you just keep getting the wrong idea about what they are saying because if it doesn't feel good, you want to hit it.
This song rocks! 🪨
I was hitchhiking the Alcan Highway to Montana from Alaska. Left  the pickup I had been in, flat tire, and it was the 7th and last one he had. Got picked up by a big Ford, and he had a bunch of 8-track tapes in between the seats. ( no radio reception, 1400 miles of gravel road…) I picked one out, and punched it in.  Free bird.

Free Bird is one of those rare gems that supersedes anything you have going on in life. You can simply tap into the magic created by Skynyrd and allow yourself to fly free. Don’t ever let anyone tell you you can’t fly!

This 4:55 gives me American Vibes! 🇺🇸❤
Such an emotional song when you really think about it and understand the words. I want this played at my funeral without a doubt.
My dad always requests this song when I play live. We all know it's a joke, and we'll probably never even attempt it, but I've been learning it secretly in hopes that I'll be able to bust it out. The solo is kicking my ass because im not really a fast player, but I'll get there one day.

I'm going to have a friend listen to this.
Bands may never realize how their music might be remembered as they light up not only the stage from which they are jamming on but how they light up the audience with the lyrics that are coming from the voices and all the members who we are fortunate to have to come together as one, you know coming full circle. This band was one that not only completed that loop but went out of their way to go outside that circle, l am blessed to have been able to witness them as they jammed up any and all the ears that were able to listen to them. Rock on now up above us and thanks for the memories of some of the all time best music we were able to now look back on and look past those fluffy white clouds and smile. That was and still is you Lynyrd Skynyrd.
The most exciting rock song ever... seeing them play live....oh my gosh
My dad used to play this in the car  on the way to our wrestling tournaments early in the morning on the weekends. I remember one time specifically driving out to a tournament at Philips Arena. I must’ve been around 8 years old at the time. I remember my brothers and I, no one was talking. Just let the song play. Those were some good times.
This song always brings back all the great MEMES for me -X-

Who feels a tremendous longing to go back there when you hear this?
Absolutely LOVE it!  Always brings me right back to my high school dances - us guys wouldn't usually dance, unless we were really trashed, but EVERYONE grabbed a partner for "Freebird!"  We slow danced all the way through it, and would be making-out by the time Allen was halfway thru that amazingly powerful solo. Man, wish I could go back.
Doro brings me here. 😎✌️

1/2 of the comments: Obituaries to the people that enjoyed this wonderful masterpiece, and a whole-hearted, emotional connection to the song  The other half: “But your honor, Freebird was playing”
I can't hear "Free Bird" without picturing the final scene of "The Devils Rejects". Still kicks ass in a major way.

What a tune
“Dad, I will put Free Bird on repeat”
My husband of 47 years passed last August still trying to figure out how to be without him like what the fuck but anyway when I’d be crying over losing someone I love he would always say I don’t know why your so upset she’s a freebird now he’s been saying that to me since my early twenty’s now I’m 64 the song has such a different meaning now this and Tuesdays gone great songs never stop being great ❤️🌞

I heard they're still playing the solo to this day in a basement somewhere, and that the guys touring are doubles.  Heard it from my friends buddy at work who knows someone who is related to someone who lives near the basement.  You heard it here first.  Edit:  If they pin this, you'll know its true.

What song is it that I always want to hear ? You bet your sweet bippy !
My dad wanted this song at his funeral. He never got a funeral because my mother decided to have a pure cremation and just have his ashes sent back. So we played it at my son's 18th birthday party instead as my dad passed away just 6 days before ❤ fly high dad ❤
How about the rest of the band kicking almost as much ass as the solo itself! 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

I just realized how well this songs lyrics fit with Attack On Titan. Like Eren was always being compared to a bird. birds are completely free, and that is the one thing Eren always longed for, and even when he was free he lost his freedom to being free.

I was living at a Jacksonville beach community when my best friend died. Free Bird was his favorite song. We took his ashes to the beach at low tide, poured them into the sand and played this song. About the time the song ended the incoming waves had washed the last of his ashes away. Free Bird will always remind me of my friend, Kenneth Lee. RIP.

I just lost my husband July 29th. Been with him since we were 15.. almost 30 years together. I was asking him for a sign that he was with me. Something that I couldn't brush off as coincidence. Today while I was reading my notifications on FB, this song started playing. I brushed it off thought there was a video playing in the background and went about my day. Literally just 10 minutes ago, I couldn't sleep so went on FB again. While reading notifications, this came on again.. Now I'm a reasonable person and a bit skeptical but I can't deny that he spoke to me through this song. I'm taking it so very badly and I'm heartbroken. He's all I've ever known.  I don't want to be free of those chains nor do I want to fly high without you -
4:55 a esto fue a lo que yo vine

What a bop. I hope this plays at my funeral, with the guitar solo playing as my casket lowers. Cheers free birds

Ah, this song in Lethal Company is the best and of course nobody cares
My pawpaw LOVED this song so much, this takes me back to watching him play his air guitar and nod his head, while I put my boho headband on and danced at around age 6 or 7 he made me so proud to be around him, miss him everyday...My pawpaw my favorite hippie ❤❤❤

In this essay I will explain how the pov character has ADHD...
When the solo comes, I start to feel the power of SKYNARDMANIA BRUUUTHER! The whole roof starts to look its about to come toppling down as those I pressed that no good stinking GIANT over my head!!!  Feel THE POWER my Skynardmaniacs! Whatchya’ gonna’ do when it comes running wild on you!?

The best guitar solo ever created...but you guys are not ready for this conversation!!
Led Zeppelin pioneered the tension and release style of music with Stairway To Heaven.  Slowly building it up to a full on band rocking extravaganza…🔥🔥🔥🔥  However Skynyrd perfected it with Freebird….👍👍👍

The song playing in my head when the government-modified cicada Brood XxX of 2027 emerges from the ground and swarms me, armed with a Mossberg 590, fighting off the inevitable end of humanity. Yes, I'm on drugs right now.
4:53 is the best part
“My mom also used to sing to me Earl. Sounds like one hell of a woman. She was Earl. She’s also dead. So just sing to me. You can’t be serious. She love Skynyrd. If I leave here tomorrow….”
this is so ...american
The song was ahead of its time.

Hands down the best band of all time😢
I have loved this song since I first heard it when I was just a kid. I am 64 now.
When u think of Southern Classic Rock Skynyrd is the ONLY band that stands the test of time. Keep rocking on in heaven 🫡🫡🫡🫡
Best guitarist to ever do it! Gives me goosebumps.

My bestie, Jackie, left this world May 26, 2022 to become a FREE BIRD.  This was played, along with select life pics, at her celebration of life a few months later.  She was thrilled, I am sure, as were her family and friends.  Fly, Jackie.

"Quando eu entro na loja BINCO comprar uma roupa qualquer".
i remember playing guitar hero with my wife shes white and im mexican american all i listen to was Rap so slowly through her i learned bout classic rock and the evolution from elvis to grunge countless hrs playing that game smoking weed and brews making love damn this takes me back to those days now we both went on our own way but this song here takes me back to when we were one shes 40 and im 42 i have a new girl by my side but this always takes me back to her ..😢😢
I'm about to test something tonight.  The distance from my house to the school I'm working right now is about 10 min. If my accounts are correct, when the solo kicks in, I'll be in a part of the way which has a long-ass straight (something about 3 miles long) with only a few long-radius turns, where you don't have to lift the throttle and brake hard to make it.   Its a really high speed part on my way back home.   Pray for me, and let's pray also for the God of Speed.
Boyz will be boyz !

These guys live through all of. us through our memories! what a special time it was back then. Life was so carefree, and always trying to be excited for what’s next! “I’m sending good wishes to each and every person out there! i’m wishing you happiness, lifelong spiritual power and ambition! i’m sending every type of positive atom I can manifest just for you….and, you, and you, you, you, you, you! There is plenty to go around so never go without!
Liked today in honor of John Temmel, who suddenly past away this morning.  He was a kind and generous man, and will always be remembered for his acts of kindness, and friendship.
Todo sucede en Elizabethtown, que grande mich!
Real blud clart music!!
4:40 for myself
Actually this song goes on forever. Engineer just faded it out at the end.
One of the greatest rock songs ever made. It’s crazy that the original band was only around for four years. It’s just too damn bad. Cheers from Texas, my freebirds.
Did anyone go here after watching evan nagao's freestyle?
this should be put in museum for future generations to know what music is
Sir there’s a 4 f-15s behind us! “Play free bird”
With this song, I shall go back in time to the first thanksgiving to get turkeys off the menu.

I'm from the U.K, Skynard and Creedence are my favorite all time bands. God bless the U.S.A 🤟
Muy buen vídeo, felicidades.
This should have been in the first Top Gun movie. Imagine a scene with this guitar solo. They would have had to make a scene just for this.
This was playing at my ice rink and i kid you not i hit my first crossover
Perfect song when you’re constipated
❤
GTA SAN ANDREAS

It's the year 2030. The world's economy is collapsing. China has invaded the United States. It looks like all hope is lost... Chinese leader: "HAHA we have defeated America!

Radios: " *LORRRDDDDD, HELP ME, I CAN'T CHAaAaAaAaNGE* "

Driving down an empty dirt road, spent from battle, your family at your side, the opening bars of Free Bird begin to crunch.   That dirty sheriff gon' got ya good but y'all still kickin', holee Miss Moleee, caught me a live one.  Angelic guitar blasts from the transistor radio as the wind licks your feral hair & cools your collective wounds.  You reach an impasse: cops have blocked the road, your Daddy sighs and slumps his head on the wheel.  He turns to look at you, you look at your sister, y'all share a secret agreement.  If it's jail or Hell, y'all choosing Hell.  You are the Devil and you're here to do the Devil's work.  Daddy slams the gas: you all hurtle towards oblivion but you're all together.  Shotguns blare out, bullets fall, fade to black.  RIP The Firefly's.
What good music
Gta 📻 radio
No one can play the guitar like Alan Collins
There plane should of never been able to take off,,,these men would be alive today all because of the love of there fans they died .

Ameriko a celý světě! Vraťte se zpět di 60' a začněte znovu a lépe ❤😂! Začnete používat mozek! (Toto není komentář k této naprosto úžasné písni).
Nejlepší kytarové sólo všech dob. PS: Rád diskutuji 😊 to snad není možné napodobit 😂. 😊😅 Magie 🎉.
Doslova "epické" sólo, tak energické, nášlapné, celkově úžasné 😮.
How  dare I see a Kamala Harris commercial before this song played.
Who is here in 2025❤
HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THIS SONG DIDN'T HIT 500 MILLION VIEWS
My girl asked me "if I leave here tomorrow would you still remember me?" I turned and said, what's your name again honey? Your on the dust
4:21 when your team is losing but you get in "the zone"
IF I LEAVE HERE TOMORROW WOUD YOU STILL REMEMBER ME   (Continue the lyrics)

Always loved this track since the 70s - nowadays it brings to mind the ending of a certain Rob Zombie movie .....

Nearly fifty years ago my high school football teammates blasted Free Bird on a boom box in the locker room as we dressed for games. That guitar solo made all of us play better (but we still weren't very good).

For those who are searching the solo part: 4:39
GTA SAN ANDREAS+ GUITAR HERO
If you played this at 11:55:05 pm on the day before new years day it will be a blast
5:00
4:35 It's the most fun.
Problem with a lot of old songs is you need to listen to 5mins of crap to get to the 1 good bit.
The rock guitar is the definition of "Lemme cook"
.
Classic 💜🎶❤
If you didnt do cocaine just seconds before the solo starts, you aint living to the fullest❤

If I leave here tomorrow - Would you still remember me? For I must be traveling on, now - 'Cause there's too many places I've got to see But if I stay here with you, girl - Things just couldn't be the same 'Cause I'm as free as a bird now - And this bird you cannot change Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh And the bird you cannot change - And this bird you cannot change Lord knows I can't change  Bye-bye, baby, it's been a sweet love, yeah-yeah - Though this feeling I can't change But, please, don't take it so badly - 'Cause Lord knows I'm to blame But, if I stay here with you, girl - Things just couldn't be the same 'Cause I'm as free as a bird now - And this bird you cannot change Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh And the bird you cannot change - And this bird you cannot change Lord knows I can't change - Lord, help me, I can't change - Lord, I can't change Won't you fly high, free bird, yeah  ... go Allen Collins go....
Straight fucking ripping 😂😂😂 always catches me off guard how the first half is just the first half and free bird is the epic fucking guitar solo.
When you smoke your pogo stick record
I love this one, even the solo is insane, someone who listens to it every day? 🎼😌🤘🏻 I'm from Brazil ✌🏻🇧🇷

Wonder if they were alive they would be paying homage to Donald Trump.
I was up late , flipping through the channels. 3, 4 am and caught LS, what’s left of them, playing Free Bird. Thought the audience were going to be old fucks like me. But there were 18, 19, younger. Sweating, screaming, dancing, completely absorbed. I realized young people of all ages will be loving this song a thousand years from now.
Im coming home soon dad 😢
Si
70 & I'm still rockin' this 😅
Playing this while playing any driving/racing game makes your vehicle gain 400hp and your top speed increases by 100mph (only applies to american vehicles)

I’d probably play this song when it’s time to leave this world have myself my own free bird moment just before I break on through to the other side
You know what the 50 pice is the wings on the back of it is angles wings on the eagle behind the shield is an real angle
Good music I think
ME TOO,,,,,,😊
You can never unhear this song after going 90 down the interstate trippin shrooms. The way this song picks up pace is fuckin wild. What a piece of art. Just what a piece of art sober or not. Wow.
Play this at my funeral 🎉
I don't think I've listened to this version.  I think the Radio edits this song to cut it short.

All seven members on the cover of the first album and who played on the Free Bird track have now passed away. The band who calls itself Lynyrd Skynyrd is no more than a tribute band these days. Ever since Gary Rossington ( RIP) passed away recently.

My sons favorite was Free ird because he loved his Free Dom to go places do things . He loved it too much. His freedom got him killed . Lake Worth Rd I hated when he was a child. He got a three wheeler and went behind cars on Lake Worth Rd . Lady came to my house not far from that Rd and told me she almost killed my son and to get him off that Rd. Michael was such a FreeBird free spirit when he grew up he still loved his freedom on Lake Worth Rd. I called him from another city from him and he was alone in his apartment . He said he had a cold and needed to go to the store. The convenient store was on Lake Worth Rd. Before I hung up with him I told him I loved him ( as his mother) He said Huh ! Like why did I have to say it.. Later on about an hour had past I got a call from the highway patrol and he told me that my son was killed by a Honda truck because that truck had long  iron pipes hanging out of the back of the truck . My son didn't use a car but his bicycle. No trails for bikes to ride safely on so he having no fear of Lake Worth Rd was pierced in the head with those pipes. He died instantly. The funeral home sent me a tiny letter full of him that's all that's left of Michael. He's freedom will be forever. I listen to Lynrd Skynrds FreeBird to get closer to my invisible son . I feel him in my heart. The man with the Honda truck wasn't charged. I have yet to find out details of this that shouldn't have happened. You lose your only son you lost part of your being as a human being. He would have protested Trump because he's an authority dictator minded person . Poor excuse for a human being. Love your son's every day tell them you love them when they leave your sight as they might not come back. Thanks for reading . I'm ok but think of him every time I here the word Freedom. He stood for freedom. He is a FreeBird now.
I love this song as a free Byrd myself
Been out of the country for ten years and I can't tell you what this song means to me now
THE SONG
SAUDADES DO GTA...
Me too!
Grüazi zäma
"Sir, why were you going 140MPH on a highway?" "I was listening to Free Bird on loop." "You're good to go."

8:55 @SadSpill Yes, thank you
The most American song ever created 😂
9:11
My dad's CD Case for music in the car, includes this song, when it gets to 4:45, he turns it to 10, (you do not know how loud that is)
4:50 “Bill nye the science guy!” Ahh moment 💀☠️
This present world is wonderfully miserable...all things will be restored. Great is our God. .
Oh yeh ! Free bird !
4:35
GTA SA 😢
I live for the guitar solo.
Inner me is screaming free bird. What a great song.
How my husband told me good bye  I wasn't enough
Me trying to do RandeZook in Warzone Caldera:
I am not gonna question why is it 9:11 long
4:42
it’s not a crime against humanity if the free bird riff is playing while your doing it
4:05 wait for it
4:35
I feel robbed I wasn't around being born in 1975 to this amazing band. As a mum I play all these kind of epic songs to my kids x
Why is this song 9 minutes and 11 seconds? 🤨
Love lgbtq from romania❤❤
✨⚡️✌️🐦✌️⚡️✨
Esta canción me recuerda a cuando jugaba gta san Andreas ❤
❤ I'm I'm sure that Lynyrd Skynyrd sang the song with great heart and loyalty which we don't get from too many singers any more of these days
I assure you god , you will win all you need and want
If I leave here tomorrow Would you still remember me? For I must be traveling on now 'Cause there's too many places I've got to see But if I stay here with you, girl Things just couldn't be the same 'Cause I'm as free as a bird now And this bird you cannot change Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh And the bird you cannot change And this bird you cannot change The Lord knows I can't change Bye-bye, baby, it's been a sweet love, yeah, yeah Though this feeling I can't change But please don't take it so badly 'Cause the Lord knows I'm to blame But if I stay here with you girl Things just couldn't be the same 'Cause I'm as free as a bird now And this bird you cannot change Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh And the bird you cannot change And this bird you cannot change The Lord knows I can't change Lord, help me, I can't change Lord, I can't change Won't you fly high, free bird, yeah
Brutal.
Its been almost half a year, but Dokibird sure flies high with everything she created and made with her community since her triumphant return. This song is still her hymn as of today. Keep flying free bird! 💛
2024 ??😂
Let's carry out the mission
My favorite ❤️
this  was in forrest gump at the new years scene
You know the solo is good when youtube doesn't put an ad in between
GTA San Andreas.  Quando pegava os aviões essa era a primeira música que passava kkkk Nostalgia
From 4:51 till the end of the video on full blast it blasts my ear drums out of my ear
música de fundo perfeita para qualquer situação que envolva um grupo de homens fazendo a maior loucura da vida
This is one of my funeral songs ❤
takes me back to reading about 1977 very popular then
Lord I cant change fly high I'm freeeeeeeeee bird yeah guitar riff kicks in that's my favourite bit💙
I am not a fan of Lnuis sry just my apinioan
I think the solo at 4:55 elevates this song from a fantastic song into the best song of all time
Pov your in a top tier match :
Really helps bring out america in this one
If I leave here tomorrow Would you still remember me? For I must be traveling on now 'Cause there's too many places I've got to see But if I stay here with you, girl Things just couldn't be the same 'Cause I'm as free as a bird now And this bird you cannot change Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh And the bird you cannot change And this bird you cannot change The Lord knows I can't change Bye-bye, baby, it's been a sweet love, yeah, yeah Though this feeling I can't change But please don't take it so badly 'Cause the Lord knows I'm to blame But if I stay here with you girl Things just couldn't be the same 'Cause I'm as free as a bird now And this bird you cannot change Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh And the bird you cannot change And this bird you cannot change The Lord knows I can't change Lord, help me, I can't change Lord, I can't change Won't you fly high, free bird, yeah
6:32 to 6:58 HOLY.FU#KING.SH1T!!!!!! 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸
When you play a Game, get slowly surrounded by a mass of enemies you just know you cant loose while that epic solo plays.
This song never gets old
4:37
GTA SAN ANDREAS 😂
....I just wanna say, I've played bass my whole life. Trying to keep up to that tempo for that long plucking on them thick ass strings is a fucking workout. Wilkenson doesn't get enough credit for the sheer amount of change ups and hard strumming he does in the background.
Actually nothing could ever compare to this song. It’s by far the most beautiful song I have ever heard. Ever single thing about it. IT IS PERFECT
*4:38*
Dales always a free bird! 👌
4:43
4:43
9 minutes is actually so crazy
Tamar❤
If you are from the 🇺🇸 and don't know this song you are a lost soul. My ears ring after this song comes on. Radio loud as it can go.
GTA San Andreas anyone?
I have a large question. I commit war crimes to this.  Am I forgiven because I was under the influence of the greatest guitar solo of all times
imagine of your in a plane crash and you have your airpods on and you have this song on
👍
4:43
😭😭😭
This sounds like something from USA
Hearing this inside a church is kinda creepy💀💀

My freind plays acoustic and I play electric we AWLAYS duo this song if you skip to the best part the back ground he plays and I play the solo
I had a close friend die. She played this song for me before she died. I loved her so much. She died from an overdose. That was the worst thing I could have thought ever happening to her. Anything else I probably would’ve been more accepting of it. Love You, Dawn.❤
0:02 hello people using the timed feature, us comments will guide you throughout the song. If you want to skip to the solo, scroll up (I can’t put the time stamp in because it will tamper with this bring the second comment) anyway, just sit back, relax and listen to free bird 🤘
That's i'm talking about... ROCK 🎸 🤘

There is a reason this song is 9 minutes and 11 seconds long
Just finished listening to this song 3 times in a row the flow, lyrics and everything is perfect, it makes you feel like life on a ranch or a special vacation that holds a special place in your heart and you just leave it all behind.
G.T.A San Andreas 😊
Cause that's riff woke my Evil soul to do something sir

When I was a pup, this was new music!
Just found out my president almost got assassinated Trump!!! You can't kill us
Never cared about this song until Kingsman: The Secret Service.  Now it's the official soundtrack of kicking copious amounts of ass in a stylish manner.
Pairs very poorly with the Lethal Company Cruiser
half the band died
The most American song I’ve ever heard 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨
Step 1 - Buy a new car Step 2 - Play Free Bird Step 3 - ...    Buy a new car
The Kingsman (and the Simpsons) did the song justice.
This will be played as the last song of my funeral service.   Before that, Gimme Three Steps and Nights in White Satin.  It's all I asked.
*4:38** A Bird Just Break Me and Just Released Me into my freedom*

Do you know what's kind of funny about this a music video on YouTube that fits so perfectly with fighter jets a.k.a. planes and it's nine minutes and 11 seconds long😂
Ronnie Van Zandt will be missed but not forgotten.

My uncle Ron died around two weeks ago, and his funeral was yesterday. He loved this song so much, and so does his dog, Buckey. Buckey came home with me today, and now we are both sitting outside in the cool grass, looking up at the stars while listening to this. We both miss Ron. RIP uncle, Buckey, and I say hello.  Edit: I wish I was kidding, but when the guitar solo started, the sprinklers went off and startled Buckey and I. I think my uncle played his final prank on us. Fly high, Ron. 🙏

My favorite song
Why is there only mourning comments in Lynyrd Skynyrd music videos?
My little brother is 6 and he loves crazy frog and numa numa, he is also a big queens fan, but like, i was also a Robbie Williams fan when i was his age and would ask my mom to play "the song with the long guitar solo" (freebird by Lynyrd Skynyrd) so it's all about how they are raised
I randomly encountered this song whilst playing GTA San Andreas and I was like "wait, that's familiar" then the solo kicked in and I was like "HOLY SHIT"
MERICAAAAA 🇺🇸🦅🎆🎆🎆 (early 4 of July jamming)
there is 2 types of people in this world people who love this song and liars
I always think of devil's rejects hearing this 😊
This on a bass boosted speaker that I got or like any other it sound beautiful on the guitar solo
JENNY DONT JUMP!!!!

One day in 2018, my mother rescued an injured bird from the road, brought it home for several days, and treated its wounds. I took care of him until he could fly. A few days later, it was determined that the bird could fly, so I closed the window of the house and it was instantly free! Live well, bird!
So cheesy, but this is gonna be played at my mothers funeral in a few days.
If this song isn’t playing at my funeral… I’m gonna leave without saying a word..
Anyone here in 6125?
Why are so many comments about the death a friend or family member.

Apparently no one here knows how to meme. Give it up guys, those suck.
I am not really this genre these days. But this song is undoubtedly one of the all time great compositions in music. I am being completely serious, i think history will remember this something like Beethoven's 5th, an ultimate expression of music.
Juni 2024 🤘🙌

Holy crap!  I was waiting on you  but then they crashed.  I was waiting on them and they showed up in Baton Rouge, where they were coming before the crash. The new band did a great job and everyone was rocking out the Convention Center.  Rip gentlemen and all that died that day. Best rock n roll music ever.  Me and my sweet wife danced the whole thing once.  We were rather tired after but what a workout.

I skipped to a random point in the solo and all of a sudden:  My brain stopped biaining; my fingers stopped fingering; my hopes to make it in gitur stopped hopping; my gitar stopped gitaring
Sir, they're everywhere! Good, we dont have to aim.

"sir..were being overrun by the Nazis! what do we do?????"     "nah, dont worry boy..the B-17'S ARE COMING!!!!"
So long, one of the greatest guitar solo on music history!
"Officer, I sincerely apologize for my crimes, but when Free Bird solo comes on, the laws don't apply to me no more"

Dive in your freedom, like a shadow from the sky, peirce the veil of the wind, catch them all on high, swoop down faster than a plane, spread your wings to the sky, from that day forward, they all began to truly fly. RIP to the best.  ❤

GTA radio song
Brings back memories of when i first started drinking and this was being played constantly on the jukebox in the Galleria Penthouse in the late 70s.   They were great memories! Still are!
They also added this song to a meme video
"Learn to fly, Carl."
I petition the US gov’t to make the last 5 minutes of this song the national anthem
A Quentin Tarantino song🤪🤪🤪
huhu❤✨🥂
When you're incognito deep behind enemy lines but the free bird solo kicks in:  *Welp, cowabunga it is*
My Uncle Tim’s favorite song in the whole world! Love & Miss You!! 🦅 06/09/2024 🦅
petition for everyone to play the song at exactly 11:55:05 PM on new years eve to start the year with the greatest gitar solo of all time
I seen them about ten times..  Allen collins played free bird.  He would jump as high as he could and then ronnie and Gary would catch him.
Wow
I talked with ronnie van zant about 3 weeks before  the crash. He was nice. Then they crashed in Louisiana which did not make my year
Isso sim é música. O resto é merda. Lynyrd Skynyrd eterno e sem dúvidas a melhor banda de todos os tempos!
Dejavu dengan GTA san andreas , guitar hero extreme
This song literally takes halfway through the song to build up.
Gracias san andreas vibes🙌

The best part 4:54
GTA SA....I swear I didn't even remember this song was in the game, but when the solo played I went to heaven
I was 46 years old when i heard this for the first time  Now im 13 and it still bangs
Who's here in 2024?

One day in 2018, my mother rescued an injured bird from the road, brought it home for several days, and treated its wounds. I took care of him until he could fly. A few days later, it was determined that the bird could fly, so I closed the window of the house and it was instantly free! Live well, bird!
My Love For This Song Is Like The Bird And Cannot Be Changed

GTA San Andreas epico
My step-daddy raised me, he owned a junk yard and he was a hard one to live with, but he gave it his all and he never let you down. He passed away a year ago from mouth cancer and gingivitis and I'll never forget him. Lynard Skynard was his favorite band, he would stay up all night drinking and yelling so this song reminds me of him, love you old Hoss!! 1🙏🏻
Still rockin this tune in 2024!
Hell ya

A classic which is about 50 years old and will still be played in another 50 years time compared to the crap that is being churned out these days and will long be forgotten then!

Vive La Réunion indépendante !
name of this song  Lynyrd skynyrd - free Bird (4:24)

"Remember... No Russian.."
Too bad people before 1973 can't justify their crime with this song
Happy birthday mom you will always be my rock 🙂
It's funny how the part everyone knows of freedird, the solo is such a small part of an otherwise pretty unremarkable song.

Best solo in rock history
Forrest Gump
"In his defense honor, Free bird was playing"
I feel as free as a bird playing my guitar music is in my nature
I have noticed that no cover plays the 5:48 part the same, which is the third "lick" of that phrase, it sounds very conclusive but in the live versions and in the covers they play it the same as the first 2, which is unpleasant because it sounds very good like that
how to play gta without stars

I have a theory that the pure adrenaline from this song can raise the dead
I've only a little time left here and I am trying to stand strong. I guess I have to thank God that I know my time is short. The song is the best way to say goodbye.

เพลงอันดับ1 ของชีวิต ที่จำตั้งแต่เด็ก ตั้งแต่เล่น GTA SAN และเป็นเพลงแรกในชีวิต ที่ตอนเด็กๆพยายามจดเสียงเพลง เริ่มต้น เพื่อจะได้จำเพลงนี้ได้ จนปัจจุบัน มันก็ยังคงเป็นเพลงที่ดีที่สุด จนเป็นตำนานต่อไป
4:42 This part was the soundtrack of one of the most dangerous moments of my life: I was outside a club with some homies of mine and one of my homies was about to start a deadly fight with this guy (of course the fight was about girls) who had homies with him as well, shit was about to turn into a Royal Rumble, but one of the "enemies" said something like: "Why don't we settle this with a car race instead of beating each other up?". It was me on a "modified" Mini Cooper and this other guy with a BMW, and we both had girls inside the car, me I had a girl from the other guy's group and a girl friend of mine was in the other guy's car. I put this song on and started to run, and I remember the girl screaming her lungs out and I was also scared but I had to win at all costs. And I did.  SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT: Don't engage in illegal car races, you could end up either dead or in jail. And be careful when listening to this song while driving.
El solo de guitarra más grande de todos los tiempos.Uno de los temas más bellos de la historia del Rock.Una joya....no tengo más que decir,era un niño pero los 70s fue la mejor década de la historia  del Rock....
Skynrd and Allman Brothers band put so much soul into their solos. They're great

soldier: “sir we’re surrounded, we’re going to die.” commander: plays free bird solo commander: “no they are…”
My ears are bleeding from how good this is
I want this too play at my funeral while my mates chuck down a beer
I am obsessed with this riff.
I like this song for this moment 4:35
bro i clutched a 1v5 in cs go while this song was playing my goodness my head taps were insane
❤❤luv this song played today for my dad in heaven 7ys xx
2026? anyone ?
que solo de guitarra
Sandwich.
4:44 is when the real song starts
This was played at my homie tim funeral on replay with simple man... he was the best smoking partner..he was 40 years older then me  and I come by to smoke next door cause my parents didn't know I smoke
Stop putting these stupid commercials in the middle of songs
I'm 40 years old, sat on a park bench here in England at 10AM with 3 bottles of white star cider. Burberry hat's peaked up, soverign rings are shining. I can't cha...ange!!!
“Dad, I’m a zoophi-“
My grandma said she loves this song so i play it in her car and when guitar solo happend she  goes i cant deal with this a sec later resumes the song
This is the song if you accidentally misclick and it has to restart the entire song you still want to listen to it beginning to end
Who are here from 2024
My fucking neck hurts from rocking out to this
Just an FYI, free as a bird isn't a good place to be. Humans are social creatures and being isolated makes one all kinds of broken because they can't understand their own people.
This song unironically got me through the worst time of my life. The woman I STILL love left me, my psyche was shattered and I developed a panic disorder and had to drop out of college, and yet Free Bird gave me the strength to remember that I survived before and I can survive again. Whether or not I am the free bird, I can at least pursue it and be freed of my freed of my failures.
pov, u are playing fortnite, and this plays
Jesus is here
If you came here just for the solo it starts here 4:48.
Americans: “Birds are drones designed by the government to spy on us” 🥸🤓  Also Americans: Fly like a freebird 🗣️🗣️🦅🦅🦅🦅
warzone champions quest
Esse solo é bom demaisss ❤❤
This is gonna my new alarm clock
Anything is legal during the solo of free bird (as well as the entire song)
4:44
why youtube would someone listen to 4 minutes of free birds and then just leave, why ask if im still listening of course i am my hands are busy you bastardo
But officer free bird was playing ‘sir you just ran over a family of six’ but free bird okay okay I’ll let it slide
I’m in the U.K. & only just discovered this band recent, I’m addicted to this song since finding it, it’s beautiful 🕊️ I just lost my cousin, my brother from another mother only aged 46… cancer, diagnosed a year too late (he’d still be here if it wasn’t for the late diagnosis)… I keep thinking he’s now free as a bird out of pain and I find this song..,🫶✨🕊️🕯️✨🕊️
THIS SONG WILL ALWAYS GET PLAY,
Sometimes you gotta ask yourself.. Where would we be without Lynyrd Skynard!
Great song, first heard it in High School, immediate classic.
Easy, breezy and hale!  Praise the Lord! ❤️‍🔥🙏🥰
This song with warthinder airplane battles is the greatest combo of all mankind
Tell me a solo better than this one🤔🤔🤔
This is my mother-in-law’s favorite song. She told us when she passes away, this song needs to be playing at her funeral. We granted her request two days ago. 🕊️❤️
When life hurts my bird friends keep me alive with love and hope in my heart
The greatest concert of all time I'm really pissed off about that pilot not calculating the weight to fuel properly
😎
Lyrics - Free bird  .  .   If I leave here tomorrow Would you still remember me? For I must be traveling on now 'Cause there's too many places I've got to see But if I stay here with you, girl Things just couldn't be the same 'Cause I'm as free as a bird now And this bird you cannot change Oh, oh, oh, oh And the bird you cannot change And this bird, you cannot change Lord knows, I can't change Bye-bye baby, it's been sweet love, yeah, yeah Though this feelin' I can't change But please don't take it so badly 'Cause Lord knows, I'm to blame But if I stay here with you, girl Things just couldn't be the same 'Cause I'm as free as a bird now And this bird you cannot change Oh, oh, oh, oh And the bird you cannot change And this bird, you cannot change Lord knows, I can't change Lord help me, I can't change Lord, I can't change Won't you fly high, free bird, yeah
Naked girl late for school reels brought me here
4:40
Best guitar solo ever!
When I listen to Freebird, my neighbors do too.
best music gta san andreas.
My bro always told me "play this when i die, cause i'll be kicking demon ass on hell" not the purest dream but HE'S TOTALLY WINNING PROB
Anyone here in 2025-whevever?  Let it die. No like only vibe. ♻️
This song reminds me of my High school History/music teacher Mr.Juarez an This Was His SONG! now im ultimately reminded of him. Juss Legendary
My grandpa met lynard skynard on their final performance before their plane crashed and most of the original band mates died. They nicknamed him whistle and before the main singer Ronnie got back on the plane he told him, “see you later whistle” he was one of them that died in the crash.
Ana mains when hearing this song
They've played before then
The real América.
The best part of the song without a question 0:00 to 9:10
(not so) Fun Fact: The guys who sung this died in a plane crash
load of codswallop silly song
Not many people know this song in my country, but I like it. I love traveling and I want to fly around the world like a free bird.
Eren Yeager approves this.
Beautiful song ❤️
*Ich stehe normalerweise nicht auf solche Musik aber das ist für mich genauso Kunst wie Klassik*
How James Gunn didn’t use this song in Guardians of the galaxy. This song is incredible
Think she remembers you?
Incroyable!
4:39
R.i.p ❤️❤️❤️
Grew up listening to lynatd skynard in Jacksonville man those were the good ole days.   80s baby
Just look at the video duration 💀
4:38
I am 70 plus female and there are 2 times in my where this song was prevalent!!!!
Solo is great and all.. but it sucks that people overlook the rest if the song, and the rest of the album, and then the rest of their discography, all of that is great, if not much, much better
There will never be a Band like this. Period. Gods of Southern Rock !
If they don’t play this at my funeral I’m not dying
Tomorrow i leave for Minnesota to start a new life. Can't stop listening to this song
Demand they they get in the rock in roll hall of fame in 2024
I’d like to know why they’re advertising in Spanish. This is the United States of America. We speak English English is the international standard language stop trying to take over our country cricket.
Me on my way to the bathroom (im a skinny white girl that just ate taco bell)
Live rock, Lynardy  monster incredibele     age age Very very
*Music* I crash in to a wall in SKY cotl and go flying FREEER BIRRRD
Anyone in 2028?
Brings back memories in California, my brother first got me into Skynyrd when this song was at the end of The Devil's Rejects, tripping on how Spaulding, Otis and Baby went out in a fire fight. He was a big fan of those flicks and southern rock songs. I always stuck to Garage Rock and such but when this one came to mind, it reminds me of the good times I had with him. He passed in a motorcycle accident ten years ago this month... I cry still knowing he died young and was so damn happy with life. I keep this on so i know hes still there...rip hermano
4:12
The view count astonished me! Boy, wouldn't I be happy to score 1/10th of 58K!
This was my first favorite song as a young adult. It went w me everywhere through life. It has more memories than any song I know. Good old days! Oh o be young again. All that mattered was the lake on weekends, friends, music, summers...and thus song. ✌️💯
The unofficial theme for helldivers 2
Yup
Esse solo é perfeito ❤
"It was... a joke."
The 50s, 60s, 70s era of Music will never be topped. Just legendary banger after banger.. What do we have now? Taylor Swift and degenerate mumble rap? The musix scene as a whole is a disgrace now
My grandson loves this song  he has his rc car and when the guitar solo starts he begins drifting and he goes ALL out!
For those who love the solo 🙂🫸4:55
The only Song probably mighty enough to bring right winged and left winged people together...a Song of Freedom!!!
4:12  The beat starts
Attack The d point
Who's here in 2026?
2024? Huh?
My cousin Steven killed himself to this song😢 I love you Steven and I know the pain you were feeling. I fight the pain daily. You are free now R.I.P
im 100% sure there were war crimes commited in the pressence of this song!
I swear to God this song becomes even better when you are almost 30 😂
Perfect❤
they ahd me in the first half, not gonna lie. what an insufferable dirge before the epic solo.
This song is making me thing about my dog, he was 15.5 and was in a lot of pain before passing away over night at the begigning of the month, i knew it was happeneing and kissed him in the head and looked in his eyes befire going to sleep, ill miss my boy, I lived my whole life with him, hope hes flying high above!
Love doing crack with this song
4:43
My cell phone was at 9% When I play the music. And it's been playing for 7 minutes and my cell phone has 2% battery and I can't find the damn charger

4:49 Epic part
I Love this song forever to all my family and friend who passed away I love you all I’ll never forget you till we meet again your all free birds free spirited in heaven
4:10
Was whistling this the other day down to a T walking down a street ...  absolutly off my chops and I noticed the security camera red led lights come on as I walked past a house, they must of been truly amazed by what they saw me doing 😂😂
No ammo left Not a problem
Is this song in a video game or something i saw a quote in the comments saying "stealth is optional for this mission" and i dont get the reference.
Love how the guitar solo doesn't even end it just fades out. Like to think it just goes forever
who's still listening in 2024 ?
THE BEST PART 6:57

😊😊😊#loveoverallwisdom = יֵשׁוּעַ =ruach ha-kodesh = Yaweh
I feel like listening to this improved my self confidence for some reason lol
One of the best songs ever.
Listening to this as I kick my controlling husband of 18 years out. Never felt  better. 🎉🎉
This song playing while i'm doing chase mission in GTA SA and i have to say it became really aggressive chase
This song reminds me of my pet goldfish Steven who sadly lost his life during the Vietnam war,  RIP Steve ❤

My Popa's funeral was today and you best believe this was was played
我草，真的能在单曲里搞4分钟的贝斯solo啊
Every time I play it, it's like being exorcised - such a pure music cleansing my soul
4:55
Bawling my eyes out as this was played at my Dad's funeral. Unfortunately he was late for everything including his own funeral so they cut it short. Not tonight tho Dad. I am playing it on repeat. Love you Dad
Done with school I have summer break now. First thing I listened to
Quem tbm lembra dessa no GTA San Andreas
POV you are playing GTA SA and the sun is setting you are either driving a car, boat or flying a plane and you are listenin to this and thinking about life.
Life motto: be as free as a bird, as said by the great southern poets Ronnie Van Zant and Allen Collins 🖤
:))
"It was .....  a joke"
Lol bro dude Lynyrd Skynyrd died in like 1977 why does this say this video was posted 1 year ago and why does it show performances.
The electric guitar goes hard i make beats check out my channel

This song is bringing the gta San Andreas vibes 🤧😢
And this bird you cannot change
I loveeee it even though my son thinks it takes forever but hr likes it
To brzmienie i cale ich utwory mnie rozbrajaja, sa niesamowite, to cecha topowych utworow badz kapel. Oni sa w top 10 realnie, bo jest masa kapel europejskich gorszych od nich, a bedacych wyzej. Te solowki mnie powalaja na kolana, a potem klade sie jeszcze krzyzem... koncertowe wersje sa duzo lepsze.
Exit from church : damn, was a fine tune!
This is right up there with  'Don't Fear The Reaper' (BOC) &  'More Than a Feeling" (Boston)
I play this always when the drinking session come to end with the boys, and then the solo hit ........ more beers appears magically
I remember the meme of this music...
Thank you Dad!!!....Fly Free!!! I got this...With Love, Your son forever and always <3 <3 <3   AIM HIGH!!!
🕺
God mode.......hold my beer
4:44  dad i Want to be zoof-
Absolute masterpiece ❤
ja deixei claro para meus amigos e familiares: toquem Lynyrd Skynyrd - Free bird no meu funeral e joguem terra no meu tumulo quando começar o solo. Quero subir ao Céu no velocidade da luz enquanto toca esse solo maravilhoso, como um passaro livre.

If I leave here tomorrow Would you still remember me? For I must be traveling on, now 'Cause there's too many places I've got to see But if I stay here with you, girl Things just couldn't be the same 'Cause I'm as free as a bird now And this bird you cannot change Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh And the bird you cannot change And this bird you cannot change Lord knows I can't change Bye-bye, baby, it's been a sweet love, yeah-yeah Though this feeling I can't change But, please, don't take it so badly 'Cause Lord knows I'm to blame But, if I stay here with you, girl Things just couldn't be the same 'Cause I'm as free as a bird now And this bird you cannot change Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh And the bird you cannot change And this bird you cannot change Lord knows I can't change Lord, help me, I can't change Lord, I can't change Won't you fly high, free bird, yeah
The part you adventurers are looking for is at 4:56

Your honor even tho my client committed mass counts of vehicular manslaughter,arson,attempted fleeing,and reckless indangerment free bird was playing that's why I think he should not go to jail
My stepdad passed, and this song is going to be played at his funeral. Fly high Steven, i miss you 💔
I'm sure I heard this music in a GTA game, but not sure which one
RIP to my good friend Roy.
Raisi heard this song moments before his demise
We are going into combat mode! Not stealth!
SUS😱 5:16
ahhh dropping into the warzone
I'm 57 and I didn't know this song. Where the hell was I? This song is great!
This song got me a dui😤
Eu so conheço essa obra por conta do guitar hero ❤
Our grandson is living here with us (divorce recovery) and he's in there practicing guitar. It's not bad, but not quite our style. My husband says "I am not fond of most guitar, only Spanish guitar and Blue Grass." My one word answer, "Freebird."
What a song...that guitar...but most of all, the Ending for these Guys 🙏
SO BEAUTIFULLLLLLL!
This goes far too well with Pachelbel's Canon for some reason...
For I say unto thee, my children, go forth, and may all sins committed during the free bird solo be forgiven.
*"side quest: no stealth needed."*
Free bird and the video is 9:11 length damn what a coincidence
Fabulous free birds
Drive this song with 5 stars behind you, that's pure amazing
4:35 Longest 4.4 minutes of my life to wait for this

4:57
The synchronization of two guitars at 6 minute mark is the greatest thing I've ever heard probably!   Each and every element of this song is perfect!
I can't remember which band or if it's even true, but apparently a big name band needed a guitarist and someone came in and played this solo. They got the job on the spot.
Gta san Andreas ps2
Depois de anos , encontrei essa música eu diria uns 16 😮😮😮
영상을 만들라니까 영화를 만드네..마지막 인간미 철철 넘치네 ㅋㅋ
“Commander we’re going down then we will be free in heaven and fly like a bird as a angel
*4:38** Broke Me Down*
I just blast Free Bird on repeat and the wardens leave me alone
As a hardworking pipefitter, this song was written into my soul.
Enemy: “It’s over! We have you surrounded!” My squad: “Commander! We’re have no ammo left. We’re out of options. Me: “No men” (pulls out machete)  “We’re just out of ammo.”
I listen this Song every day..2024 Need more of this kind of music...fuck the new music..ciao dall'Italia
4:55 this is what you’re looking for😊
Using this song as background for my senior project
They are all now free birds Rip

Sends me to heaven… to the depths of my hell & back again…. Peace ✌️
Anyone else here right after watching Kingsman?
This was playing in the Jenny scene that instantly turned "Forrest Gump" from great to EPIC.
anyone 2024?
If you like the whole outro solo (and yes, you do) check out a song waisted white boys by a band called WASP, similar vibe and a kickass song overall
I turned this on in car and my dad starts drifting.
4:40 minutes sucks and after the Song starts
Essas sim q eram boas não esses funks de hj em dia

The suspense of waiting for the solo riff @4:55 feels like an eternity. But man when it hits you the dopamine is unreal
I broke up with my manipulative girlfriend just minutes and i came to listen to this song as it will describe my state right now.
Yup  back again... mothers day 🎉 2024... be 4yrs 5-22. Missing my mom.....
School zone more like racing zone
Who came here because of GTA San Andreas and Dokibird?
I always think of Devil's Rejects hearing this.
Cuando estoy triste, acabado y mi mente nubla mi corazón con malas propuestas, tomo mi auto hacia el corredor, lo llevo hasta llegar el límite y me siento como un free bird! Está canción, me ha salvado muchas veces de mi mente. 😢
This is the song that can save humanity. Bill and ted got it wrong. I have listened to this over the years over a thousand times. The way these guys jam, wow. Something that has been lost in modern music.
its sooooooo good
Note to self: Lead up: 4:10 Pre-Kick: 4:38 Kick: 4:55
Damn this song is 9/11 min long 💀
It's not a solo, it's three people playing...

Wearing ear buds, in waiting for my name to be called in court. I couldn't hear my name called. I had someone next to me nudge me.   Said out loud to that person, ear buds still in... I'm listening to one of best solos ever leave me alone. Pulled them out afterwards.   Thankfully, the Judge was a fan. Explained to him after I ended being last one in the court room told him what I was listening to.   Then told him a true story about visiting Van Zant's grave. He asked if if it was in Gainesville or Jacksonville. Said nope south of Jacksonville in Orange Park, FL. That's where he's at.  Then we laughed together about people thinking he was in Alabama because of Sweet Home Alabama.   He let me off on a real small fine.
4:50 is the part
This would've been perfect for Far Cry 6 as youre liberating Yara.

If I leave here tomorrow Would you still remember me? For I must be traveling on, now 'Cause there's too many places I've got to see But if I stay here with you, girl Things just couldn't be the same 'Cause I'm as free as a bird now And this bird you cannot change Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh And the bird you cannot change And this bird you cannot change Lord knows I can't change Bye-bye, baby, it's been a sweet love, yeah-yeah Though this feeling I can't change But, please, don't take it so badly 'Cause Lord knows I'm to blame But, if I stay here with you, girl Things just couldn't be the same 'Cause I'm as free as a bird now And this bird you cannot change Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh And the bird you cannot change And this bird you cannot change Lord knows I can't change Lord, help me, I can't change Lord, I can't change Won't you fly high, free bird, yeah
At first I was like do they really have to drag out a slow part... But now... The build up was delicious 🔥🔥🔥

Doing  100mph in the rain  crossing the country the mountains of Tennessee  have nothing on me
I made a striper cry when I song it to her sueun OKC
God i miss this rednecks, this was God's music.
top tier song
The solo can release any woman or man from their chains in their moment of glory. I know. I have experienced it.    Had to sell my Chevy Monte Carlo 86 SS, last year. She was the one true love. A hunk of metal, but more just than metal, She had a soul.  So i drove her to the location of the buyer.  Put on a playlist, and this song was the encore for the ride. For a moment there, someone or something  was there and played the song at the right moment.  I Was under the speed limit, because she was too scary to drive fast with, she rustled so damn hard at 3000 Rpm. When i got to a tunnel at the highway, the solo kicked in. And i said fuck it, and pushed the throttle so godamn hard like never before. Never seen the rpm needle pass 4500K before. I drove so goddamn hard while screaming to the solo ( "Lord i can't change") .. At that moment, i was free. No Other cars behind or front of me. No one to witness the aesthetic experience, just her and me.   No chains or rope  to claim bondage. I was a free man.  If i die here, i die happy. My car, and me. Together forever. I don't care.   I can easily say, that i cried so much when the song faded out.  I Miss that girl, one of a kind.
awesome.

I love the first “and this bird you cannot change” imagine you had no idea what this song was and thought it was just a chill song until then. And then it just goes back to being calm. Like “wtf was that? Is that just never gonna come back?” And then the second one hits.
Master piece forever . ..all politics aside .. . .

This song plays in my head when i come back to a building at a high level in a game that is full of enemies that you were meant to fight at a low level.
Nothing beats the soul of good ol southern Dixie rock
If I leave here tomorrow Would you still remember me? For I must be traveling on, now 'Cause there's too many places I've got to see But if I stay here with you, girl Things just couldn't be the same 'Cause I'm as free as a bird now And this bird you cannot change Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh And the bird you cannot change And this bird you cannot change Lord knows I can't change Bye-bye, baby, it's been a sweet love, yeah-yeah Though this feeling I can't change But, please, don't take it so badly 'Cause Lord knows I'm to blame But, if I stay here with you, girl Things just couldn't be the same 'Cause I'm as free as a bird now And this bird you cannot change Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh And the bird you cannot change And this bird you cannot change Lord knows I can't change Lord, help me, I can't change Lord, I can't change Won't you fly high, free bird, yeah

All I can see in my head are the clips of countless of people running away from omniscient beings 😂
This song reminds me of my late dad. This was his favorite song of all time. Whenever I hear this song I alway think about him. He's been gone since 2017. It breaks my heart just listening to it but he's in Heaven. May he rest in peace. Ron Ford. 1958-2017. 😢

I thought this song was about coping with integration during the 60’s and 70’s …. I didn’t know it was about leaving you wife and kids behind to explore the world and other women hence “I can’t change”

Obviously, incredibly fantastically brilliant.

This song reminds me of Eren Yeager!
Sometimes I legitimately forget that the lyrics portion and the solo at the end are actually part of the same song.

Ah, piloting a Hunter through the entire San Andreas...

You ever wonder what it felt like to write the most iconic guitar solo? The first time that was ever played had to have been otherworldly
When you and your friends wanna go out at night and do some stupid sh*t
Me! I am here.  Good stuff here!
No ones talking about the emotion and beauty of the first part..
best song by far
I'm in my 40s and it's the first time I've heard this song... I get goosebumps my eyes watered.... D@mn what a fuk@#$% SOLO
All birds that fly away find their way home, to wherever that is.

Fuck this song that was an expensive guitar
This takes me right back to the ‘Free Bird’ dance that we Brits did - though, maybe it was a universal dance; i don’t know.   However, I never had the confidence to step out and try to do it. My mate and another bloke I knew seemed to be masters of it. I felt such a loser!  Sadly, their both dead now.   Let’s just keep loving each other, no matter how inferior or superior we feel to each other.

Hi
Ending of rob zombie movie😊
Tbh this song and devil rejects really brought out how this group died. Just differently
Democracy!!! 🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅
The solo reminds me of those Left 4 dead speedruns where they bunny hop all the way to the end
I wonder if when they were writing this song they realized what an absolute banger they have on their hands.
Para mí este soberbio, mítico, descomunal y devastador solo con 3 guitarras ilustres y afiladas como colmillos de Cobra Real está a la misma altura del legendario y apocalíptico solo de "Comfortably Numb" de David Gilmour. Absolutamente estremecedores y abrasivos. EXPLOSIÓN ROCKERA DE DIMENSIÓN NUCLEAR. La excelencia inalcanzable del ROCK SUREÑO de Lynyrd Skynyrd junto a mis admiradísimos The Allman Brothers Band.
This song has the souls of many of us
🤟🤟🤟
Decades ago this was America. A country that is free, and prosperous, but now it feels like a third world shithole.

Thank you for one of the best memories I will every have.... As we journeyed home from an exhilarating robotics competition, the hum of the bus was suddenly pierced by the unmistakable strains of "Free bird." Instantly, my friend Harry and I locked eyes, sharing an unspoken understanding as the iconic melody ignited a spark within us. With infectious energy, we began to sing along, our voices intertwining with the music's soul-stirring lyrics. It started with just a the two of us singing along, but as the iconic riff approached, more and more voices joined in, and soon the bus was alive with the sound of everyone singing and grooving to the music. As the iconic riff kicked in, a wave of energy swept through the bus. Heads violently bobbed as everyone surrendered to the infectious groove of the song, fully immersed in the moment. Although this may have happened just yesterday, I know this song will bring me back every time I hear it.

Lyrics  If I leave here tomorrow Would you still remember me? For I must be traveling on, now 'Cause there's too many places I've got to see  But if I stay here with you, girl Things just couldn't be the same  'Cause I'm as free as a bird now And this bird you cannot change Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh And the bird you cannot change And this bird you cannot change Lord knows I can't change  Bye-bye, baby, it's been a sweet love, yeah-yeah Though this feeling I can't change But, please, don't take it so badly 'Cause Lord knows I'm to blame  But, if I stay here with you, girl Things just couldn't be the same  'Cause I'm as free as a bird now And this bird you cannot change Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh And the bird you cannot change And this bird you cannot change Lord knows I can't change Lord, help me, I can't change  Lord, I can't change Won't you fly high, free bird, yeah

Not gonna lie, haven't heard this song before one of helldivers 2 montages and now I have to listen to it :D
Man hear, man happy
I'm here just because I wanna know what a kilometer is
4:55
Best song ever
do you go to jail if you commit a series of felonies while listening to free bird?
This reminds me of a Saturday night when my father gave me an old radio of his and asked me to put new batteries into it, he not being able to see well enough to get them in for himself. I managed to get the radio going and gave it a tune, and got this track on some station or other. My poor dad was tired and wanted to go to bed but i wanted to listen to Freebird (which had only just started.) Thus i managed to deny him the chance to go to his pit for the length of time that this track lasts, and he had to hear it all, on his newly fixed radio.
Wanna know in 1 word? Yeah Wanna know in 2? HELL YEAH
I'm listening to this in my car. Just pulled into my driveway during the solo. Gotta sit and listen can't turn it off during the best part 😂
Still someone listening to this in 2024
jester free bird
porra de solo fantástico ...
Song GTA sandreas
When you here this melody，represent time to escape from jester
The Devil’s Rejects
Flying an F15 in DCS with this playing is OP
This song is like that one boss fight that you've heard get endless hype for how amazing and difficult it is, and then you get to it, and are sorely disappointed at how easy it is. Until phase 2 starts, at which point you're just sore, from the absolute curb stomping he gives you.
2024 VERY NICE
First i think of San andreas then I think of the devil's rejects
Muito boa a música, com certeza umas das relíquias do rock mundial

To be free it's not just to be anything, but to be a certain something which is our proper nature unhindered.
The trees are speaking binary
If I leave here tomorrow Would you still remember me? For I must be traveling on, now 'Cause there's too many places I've got to see  But if I stay here with you, girl Things just couldn't be the same  'Cause I'm as free as a bird now And this bird you cannot change Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh And the bird you cannot change And this bird you cannot change Lord knows I can't change  Bye-bye, baby, it's been a sweet love, yeah-yeah Though this feeling I can't change But, please, don't take it so badly 'Cause Lord knows I'm to blame...

I have liked this song very much when I played GTA SA for the first time and still remember of me roaming in countrysides in San Andreas and this song started to play. I think that was a mission where Carl had to go to another city with old man after his brother went to jail.
Here 4:55
This was my best friend’s favorite song. She passed in a car accident in January. I miss her so bad
"I'm as free as a bid now."
Only listen to this song when im feeling it.. todays one of those days   such a beautiful song and man behind it
First time I heard this song was in 1856, I was working on a rice farm with my brother when a car came running through the field at 5 km/hour and hit my brother. This song reminds me of him.

nobody talks about the drums during the guitar solo. It's just amazing (7:24)
Am i the only one jamming to Free Bird in 2024? 🤘🤘🤘
Just an old hippy that mostly listens to Simon Phillips and Down to the Bone these days but. Check out Zakk Wylde excellent guitarist played with Ozzy Ozboure. Has a really cool voice.
I love how this video is a huge plast of history. I mean not just the song, but the comments.  Will this be about someone's dad suddenly and sadly dying as of cancer, the death of Skydog, the death of Selen...  This song is one of the masterpieces that don't leave you bored. I always miss a person I loved, and this song keeps the bad thoughts off.  I always was, am, and will be here.  #Freebird.
Love the comment bro we will carry on. Just wanted tell you guys I'm a 65 year old woman. The power of music to transcend. Wondeful
Glad to hear it carry on
I would love to set my world free

So I really messed up some things today which resulted in stress. It was getting impossible to get my head out of it. Then all of a sudden my brain runs free bird in my head ( specifically "LORD KNOWS I CAN'T CHANGE") and half of my stress was gone . Music is really overpowered.

That guitar solo is pretty crazy. I've heard this song from time to time, but I don't think I've ever heard the full version till now.
Lots of quotes I don't get on this comment section.
It was a horrible experience for our dear Doki has been going through but I am thankful that I can discover this masterpiece.  The rift is truly setting her free.
Who else is here cause of Dokibird? 😂
People who just came here to listen to the song: Who on Earth is Selen? This is a joke, please don't take it seriously
The greatest piece of rock and roll ever.
I was here because of Kingsman 10 years later I'm here because of Dokibird

Free as a bird now
2024 ❤ Discovered thanks to the rise of the foot solider film last year
Kingsman and Ogerpon made this song fire. 🔥
Me playing war thunder and listening
This song just unlocked something in me. My mom died unexpectedly in July, and when the guitar solo kicked in I just started sobbing more uncontrollably than I have since she passed. We're from Jacksonville, home of LS, and my mom and her brothers would have been in their late-teens and twenties when Skynyrd was coming up in the early 70s.  She's from a big family, and a number of her brothers and sisters (my uncles and aunts) have been passing in recent years. It's easy to imagine them back in the day heading to a Skynyrd show in Jax, drinking beer in the parking lot, and letting loose to this same solo. I'm 34 now and grew up listening to Lynyrd Skynyrd, and this song has always been energizing, emotional, and powerful. I haven't listened to it fully in years, you hear a song so many times you think you know it as well as you can. But this time around, it really messed me up and got me feeling all sorts of profound things. Thanks! RIP Mom, David, Robby, Al, Margaret <3

I was just pissing about on my guitar after my daily practice, and I was bored. I just played this song and jammed with it and had an eargasm I simply can't describe. I now remember why I picked up the guitar in the first place.
Played Freebird for the first time at my gig on Saturday night (solo acoustic guitarist/singer doing classic covers). Loved every second of it - the audience did too (they actually shouted "Freebird"!). Turned out really well so I guess I'll have to play it again.
If I leave here tomorrow Would you still remember me? For I must be traveling on now 'Cause there's too many places I've got to see But if I stay here with you, girl Things just couldn't be the same 'Cause I'm as free as a bird now And this bird you cannot change Oh, oh, oh, oh And the bird you cannot change And this bird, you cannot change Lord knows, I can't change Bye-bye baby, it's been sweet love, yeah, yeah Though this feelin' I can't change But please don't take it so badly 'Cause Lord knows, I'm to blame But if I stay here with you, girl Things just couldn't be the same 'Cause I'm as free as a bird now And this bird you cannot change Oh, oh, oh, oh And the bird you cannot change And this bird, you cannot change Lord knows, I can't change Lord help me, I can't change Lord, I can't change Won't you fly high, free bird, yeah
Am i the only one that thinks of Forrest Gump when I hear this song? When Jenny is in the hotel and she climbs up on the balcony wall and nearly slips and falls to her death in those CRAZY RIDICULOUS HEELS.... This is the song playing in that scene.

in the 70's my great grandma was living in a trailer near the studio where they recorded this. she would complain to her daughter and grandkids about "those longhairs that are too damn loud". one day, she got a knock at the door and the entire band was there: "ma'am, i just wanted to say, we are very sorry that our music kept ruining your day, but we just had our first hit and we got enough money to go on tour, so we won't be bothering you again anytime soon". she invited them in and had iced tea with them. she said that they were the perfect gentlemen and when that plane crash happened she said that she just felt so sorry for their mommas.
K-Rose where you have gone...
Respawn was hyping with all those references to 3 and they just make some stupid apex update...

When you start hearing that guitar, that's when you know it's time to leave before jester gets you.
I live a short walk from the Van Zant Home, Their Graves, and I met Rossington At Sam Ash In Orange Park. I was born in 01 but Skynyrd has been a key player in the soundtrack of my life.
4:55. No need to thank me.

Im planning on making an animation for the solo because I listen to this song on the bus on the way to school, and I have this really vivid day dream about a school bus that has rockets boosters that pop out and it flys away, lol. The song ends with the bus getting chased by the military off a bridge and it flys away straight up. 🚌💨

Este tema en la pelicula forrest gam

GTA SAN ANDREAS VIBE....Beautiful song, thank you Lynyrd Skynyrd☺
At my funeral I want this song to play, and right when the solo comes on I want my body to pop out of of the coffin with my guitar and have my body being worked like a puppet so it seems like I'm playing the guitar
This song is so beautiful.  Reminding us of the glory of Eternal Life and true freedom. Born Again on American soil. Jesus Loves You.

I don't like Lynyrd Skynyrd but GOD he makes good music.
Everyone remembers the guitar solo for this song, but what I think makes this song great is the same thing that makes the “In the Air Tonight” drum solo so good. They make you WAIT and build so much anticipation that by the time it explodes, it’s almost surprising
Free me LS !

This song will always be in my top 10. Such a beautiful masterpiece!🤘🏻

this sh*t SLAPS in wt
I played this song December 31 at 11:59 and all i could discover was that I'm not a bird, i felt from the roof of my house and nearly broke my right knee 😅🤷🏻‍♂️ but yeah i i love this song as much as being drunk at Christmas.
First time I heard this song was on the prison bus. I went a way for awhile it always ran thru my mind
My grandpa told me that he hopes our generation will carry on this old rock and roll and I promise we will
Hey I'm only 14 but my grandpa showed me what good music is and this new stuff ain't got nothing on old rock and country
Hey I'm only 14 but my grandpa showed me what good music is and this new stuff ain't got nothing on old rock and country
🦅
4:48 holy.
One great song of all time and people just listen to song all the time because it's a classic song and I think of two people that mints the world to me that how powerful this song is all of us have someone that we can point to this song think about it
0:00 makes me cry because it’s so emotional. I first heard it at the ending of The Devil’s Rejects
Take a drink for every comment talking about playing this song on New Year’s Eve
I love this song <3
That's why I'm single at 64 years old. Never had a hankering for relationships.
esta cancion me recuerda a mi esposa la amo mucho

If I leave here tomorrow Would you still remember me? For I must be traveling on now 'Cause there's too many places I've got to see But if I stay here with you, girl Things just couldn't be the same 'Cause I'm as free as a bird now And this bird you cannot change Oh, oh, oh, oh And the bird you cannot change And this bird, you cannot change Lord knows, I can't change Bye-bye baby, it's been sweet love, yeah, yeah Though this feelin' I can't change But please don't take it so badly 'Cause Lord knows, I'm to blame But if I stay here with you, girl Things just couldn't be the same 'Cause I'm as free as a bird now And this bird you cannot change Oh, oh, oh, oh And the bird you cannot change And this bird, you cannot change Lord knows, I can't change Lord help me, I can't change Lord, I can't change Won't you fly high, free bird, yeah

Many of friends have tried killing themselves. Instead of grieving for the ones I’ve lost, I’ll know they’re as free as birds now, haha. With hopes for you to get a better life, love you Will, Addison, Jacob, hey guys.
My girlfriend broke up with me today, said I was too ugly!!! And I thought she was emotionally mature, she then continued to tell me about how she loves me and doesn’t want to break up.   Sorry, I’m as free as bird now 🦅 😂
4:35 the trolley problem answer

This song should get an award or something
First time hearing this song from GTA san andreas Radio in 2005
Masterpiece….number one fan from Israel 🇮🇱, also love the Allman Brothers Band 👌🏽
The song that plays when youre about to do some crazy ass shit
Viniste por los memes de Stephen Hawking
Hell yeah
4:48
I have eated a dog
Nerd skin nerd free bird
Back in the 80s by aunt was in the car with her boyfriend it was dark and snowing she got into a car crash in this song is playing I’m not lying like imagine I’m a free bird yeah then getting hit
A wise man once said a rat cannot be anything more than a cat-running  Cheese eating rat. Me: too bad buddy (spins to free bird 10 hours on New Year's)
Free Jester!
4:39
4:45
Right....i thought that was the statue of liberty
😎😎😎 4:45 😎😎😎
My Favourite song ❤
I think this is my favourite solo(s) ever
Love this song and still hope it's playing in 2034
One of the biggest Solos of All Time.
Listening to Free bird right now in the movie Devil's Rejects. Lynard Skynard was an awesome band and this is one kickass song. That guitar solo is badass💪🏽
Best song ever❤❤❤
Ngl the way the song crescendos up in the beginning and then doesnt get to the sick guitar solo feels like the song is edging me
Imagine playing this to a medieval peasant
song starts at 4:08
Joy to the world to all the boys and girls.  Joy for you and me
What about Emerald by thin lizzy for a classic guitar solo also.
this music is 9:11 for some reason uh?
God save this musice
Absolute legends the song the guys behind it the sound…awesome r.i.p beautiful people.
Nsnsndndkdnsjd djdn
Free solo guitar
Joe dirt was wrong not 9 mins 8 secs its 9 mins 10 secs
I use this song while I'm at the gym and holy fuck, it's like using cheats.
4:15 :D
Anyone here because Lethal Company jack in the box mod?
, play song at my funeral but I want  be there
Dude I can't stop listening to this masterpiece🔥🤘
20 second ad at beginning is annoying
Gotta say every time I listen to this song it reminds me of my freedom!!! God bless America 🇺🇸 💯💯🔥🔥🦅🦅🦅🦅🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲
It’s simply incredible that Ronnie Van Zant would often say to people including his own father that he’d be dead before the age of 30, and went onto die 87 days before his 30th birthday, if there was ever a movie made about Lynyrd Skynyrd this song would be perfect to play in the background of a scene showing the bands plane descending into the trees
POV: you are driving down a highway after your old home has been burnt down. You eventually stop dead in your tracks when you see armed law enforcement. However, you put the pedal to the metal and law enforcement starts shooting at you. However, you survive the gunshots and are taken into medical treatment.        Can you guess what im referring to here?
Hell yeah.
This is the epitome of a Total Jam Song....... Oh Yeah Baby!!!!!!!
4:55 🦆
Man still gives me goosebumps ,every guy that knows guitar play knows this song is golden ,the times music was music and you needed to play instrument not pc as now...who push dislike button ,f u😂😂😂
HELL YEAH
Listening with my sister in the bed 😂😂😂😂
The best things are all in the past
I'm a chicken. But don't call me one.
Dedication to Danny my free bird if you're reading this I will always love you.
4:36 solo starts
Rockstar are legends for putting this song in gta San Andreas!
Lynyrd Skynyrd This is still one of Rocks greatest songs ever recorded... They just don't make great music like this anymore...
GTA San Andreas nostalgia hits me hard whenever I hear this song, I first played GTA SA on PS2 almost 20 years ago, how time flies...
I realize this isn't really a hot take, but I feel like Free Bird is objectively one of the greatest pieces of music of our time. Like... regardless of what your taste in music is, you have to acknowledge that this song is something special.
FREEEE BIIIRD!
Q canción tan pésima
Hold those lighters way up high!
Anybody remember this song from Willy’s wonderland?
Me deixem voar seus putos 😊
4:55

If I leave here tomorrow Would you still remember me?

04:50 best
This is the best song ever. I love it so much that I'm on hospice right now and I am gonna be obviously dying soon and I told my daughter and my parents that this is the song I want played at my funeral. I just think it's the most beautiful and perfect song for it.
When the Intrusive thoughts win: 4:35
the song intro featured in Forrest Gump
I was born in the US but live in Australia. When bands are doing requests, I always yell out “Free Bird.”  They don’t get it, but I’ve been doing it now for 27 years, because, “Lord help me, I can’t change.”
Only 20 million views? We all know this has way more than that like WAY more
Hello… In honor of my brother RENE  a veteran of the United States Marine Corps passed away this morning at Temecula hospital.  He was 63. If you could play FREEBIRD BY LYNARD SKYNARD … that would be cool.    GOD BLESS

i was playing GTA San Andreas when i first heard this song. it immediately made me stop and listen to it. amazing song, brings a nostalgic feel
One of the worst songs ever. The lead guitar is a joke it's sloppy and too repetitive. Only decent track they ever did was Sweet Home Alabama.
🎉🎉🎉🎉
Great way to start the year💯
Nothing better than rocking the best guitar solo on new years🎉🎉🎉
