Taraji has been in Hollywood for over 25 years and she never thought about producing and directing? Tired of this chick always complaining.
I had to come back to this video because it struck to me that money doesnt give you happiness. May Jesus help those in need.
You signed the dotted line o well!!!
She needs to be protected for speaking out against the evil industry.
Poor Taraji, it’s so unfair😥
It’s actually infuriating…Pay this woman her worth!!!… it’s Taraji P Henson… wth…
2:38 ....2:54✊🏼
This is what I’m saying…This is why I am crying and cry then Pull me in. It’s the team, the construction if you want a certain set look, stylist, uncle Sam and it’s a lot. And although I am a Mexican Citizen, I cry because…”I still gotta stretch that dollar till Monday and people don’t want translate or even want to talk to you and i’m just as down to earth with such strength. It’s hard
Stay humble u to breatiful

I get it sister lol frfr
Gayle's BFF is the one mistreating black people.
So she only makes 3.3 million out of the 10 million paid to her per project ohhhhh poor thing i feel so bad for her and her co workers how ever do they survive off of such a poor salary wage, they work sooooo hard 😢  their out there building the infrastructure in society, the streets the drainage systems and infrastructure,  blood sweat and tears, literally covered in human, blood, shit and piss and whatever else people put down drains, dangerous chemicals. All For a wage that can barely pay for housing, food, etc... this is a fucking disgrace in 2025 people have caught onto now and are no longer swallowing all the the unhinged word salad that these vial people spew
Taraji is unlikely to command a high salary because she continues to take roles in Tyler Perry's lower-budget films, which typically pay less. An actor's salary tends to increase when they star in multiple successful movies that generate significant revenue.
Who was the interviewer? Gayle?
My naïve mindset: Hollywood is great to all beautiful starlets. Beautiful starlettes are so powerful, with their beauty, influence, and money, they can do anything they want!  My now more mature mindset: Not a black one. Hollywood is not nice to any glamour girl of color, especially a black glamour girl.
Why does it wound me to watch? I don't even know this woman from Eve and I feel so horribly for her.
As as blackmperson overseas  WE FUCKING LOVE TARAJI
This woman’s talent in undeniable her scene in hidden figures where she talking about the restrooms is one of the most felt scenes I’ve ever witnessed in my life how can women like Cameron Diaz and Julia Roberts Demi Moore make 10 20 million a movie and she is on the same level
I met her thru humiliation ritual on empire tv show  as Sag extra actress that why God shutted it down cuz of me😂
They can't do this too my Queen pay her, her dues damnit!
People in power will say things and try to brain wash us into thinking negative things about people of color. Jealousy. Its jealousy
Umm was that Oprahs wife GAYle doing the interview?
She has to find out how beyonce and jayz and other successful people dontgwt taken advantage of. Think outsidethe box. Theres something she doesnt know about that she needs to tind out. Her fans wil support her on whatever she choose to do
they tell you to not go overseas because they are trying to limit you and keep you within their market. it is a much different world out there. ishowspeed just went overseas and made a huge audience.
Dude in the hat is full of it
Its not just in acting, its every Damn industry in this racist azz country. It is by design not by accident. Taraji we know your worth we your people see you sis❤
No matter the industry, black women always get the short end of the stick
Damn I feel you cause that’s what’s you work for just like if I go to school and don’t get paid what we worth
Taraji you are multi talented and we love you from Jamaica. You’re worth every dollar and more
I’m from Africa. Taraji is a superstar here!
May Allah easy ur pain do what you love and dont worry about the money  get u a small conforable place to live and praise God stop paying all these bills and interest dont pay to these fools. keep doing what u love  its okay .. i love ur acting
Then leave the secret society alone and do GODwork.AND STOP PLAYINGS  GAMES WITH THE DEVIL . You will always be at the bottom if you don't know HOW TO rise IN JESUS
In today's day and age, this is crazy. I am in SA and Taraji is massive here, I love her movies, shows and everything. We love her, trust me she is very known overseas. This poor treatment needs to change, Taraji is so talented ,what an actress an amazing  artists🎉😅. Also marketing need to really do research and findout how popular she is around the world! Give her what she deserves!
Sus & what career is paying more?
We don't translate overseas is a lie
Bravo 2 the director
It's always us😢
I’m from the UK 🇬🇧 And Taraji does translate over seas! They lying. I don’t even look at who directed it if I know she’s starring.
9999998❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉
U gassssssss 💚 💯 ❤ ♥ QQQQQQQQQQQ ❤

MATTHEW 15:11 KJV THAT WHICH COMETH OUT OF THE MOUTH DEFILETH A MAN THOSE WHO'S NAMES WERE NOT WRITTEN IN THE LAMBS BOOK OF LIFE WERE THROWN INTO THE LAKE OF FIRE FOREVER KJV
I will lose sleep if she quits acting how will i live
You do translate...we see you right here in South Africa & recognise your contribution to the industry...❤
Yeah I don't know if talking to Oprah's best friend is going to help. I feel like Oprah has manipulated Tyler Perry's mind. Taraji is one of the best. Oprah is evil.
And she got screwed over by Oprah, Tyler Perry, etc...her people screwed her over...Monique knows ALL BOUT THAT !!! The math ain't mathin😮
Chile bye us everyday working ppl im sure wish had more but it is what it is. Ppl think because they on tv they should be automatically rich but most actors and actresses arent gonna get much taraji is blessed but she dont see her blessing's because shes entitled
people believed the pay disparity issue coming from Taraji P Henson because she is more famous than Monique. People believed Monique wasn't getting paid a lot because she wasn't as relevant.
What he saying? Dont talk walk ... hun😊
The bread
It's not only her, it's the culture of Hollywood and when you have strong black women like Opra who ain't helping the cause.   Well, it's hard to complain because your circle is corrupted. Folks like Opra and Tyler have forgotten where they came from.
Im sorry this is so weird….maybe I missed it but didn’t see this energy when Monique was getting dragged down.
Let's just come out and say it as it is. Black people we have all ways struggled for what we have but let's put the light on the fact that our own people. make it harder than other races to be treated equally
OPRAH WHERE U HIDING
That’s why Trump was right about tax cut this people get ripped off half of they money before getting they check and then more then half to pay they crew and they also have to pay tax on it so basically they pay 80 % just on tax stop voting democrat they not here to help you they here to keep you a slave
Ngl Mo been in her ear for too long. Mo she a lovely person but you shouldn’t get involved with her she a career killer. In the industry you have to be willing to meet in the middle people in the middle not everything has to be a battle. Protect your mental Tiraji its nothing wrong with putting you and yours first💯
Why is he discredited her by saying kumbya bullshit when she’s saying she’s underpaid and undervalued. Fight for her to make that money Mr. Director
Be strong Ms. Henson🙏🙏🙏
Ohhh myyyy
Black women climb ladders that nobody think they deserve! But keep going keep climbing! Because the respect will be there ! Always and after watching this imma climb every fucking ladder and let my voice be heard ! From the top of it
go work to the McDonald or KFC. After that we can talk.
Like, they don’t do 1st, 2nd, 3rd shifts daily and when they do they thing they get whatever. That has to cover life a while. We see them but how long for real in between.   Upcoming artist pay attention 💯 %  Same time shhh hard when you do give all of you daily and it enough. 😢😢😢
I'm a Chinese from Malaysia and i watched Hidden Figures. So it does translate overseas
SIR! None of that will pay the bills. They need to get paid for the work they do and if you think they are inspiring a new generation, pay them accordingly to then also inspire a new generation to want to work because they know they will also get paid their worth. Don’t talk to me about the feelings and emotions. They aren’t putting a roof over my head.
If she brought in the views and was a draw she would’ve been paid more. She has never been a blockbuster movie star.
I have to tell you taraji. I will watch a movie just because you're in it.
I respect her honesty and vulnerability....
It's not 50 percent of the top. She is a selfish person and is lying on camera. She is selfish. Her issue is real. But she's not someone worth anyone's sympathy.
I feel her. Even in a smaller case working in a company can be like that. I break something that is impossible for me, somebody else just reach something more without doing the same or more effort. That is why I am taking courses to be able to do part time because like she said "I have to, the math ain't mathing. "
when u don’t sell your soul look at how harder it is for u to make it
Bby you gotta get ya credit uppppp
Sigh. "The math ain't mathing?" If men really wanted to pay the least to women specifically for doing the same job that men perform THEN there would be ZERO men in every profession.  Study Economics. This is ultimately silly.
Just sad! Such a talented, experienced actress. The industry should be ashamed.
On no poor her. She’s making movies in Hollywood and making millions aww I feel bad for her 😢
Taraji and Mo’nique literally saying the same thing but to the people in the comments section still saying nah mo’niques beef is different - no it’s not monique was also right when she said it’s the way she says it that people don’t like, you can’t handle a straight up black woman, I know this dance so well I’m aborginal Australian my family were part of the stolen generation so I look eauropean Australian 100% but I ain’t ever forget my roots or shit on my own mob and it’s true quote on quote “polite society” are happy to give us opportunities if we look and act a certain way but the minute we show them we haven’t forgot where we come from they can’t handle it. And don’t translate overseas, such a lie, don’t let them say that I’m Australian I know exactly who you are ❤❤❤
That is so hard for here i knew from the moment she started talking she was going to cry this is so sad to se here like this
Danielle looking at taraji at 2:07 like “Yeah she crashing out”
Do these artists bring in a lot of money with their movies?
Why does she have a 'team' ??    She needs like one tenth of a manager.  That's it.
The industry is an evil organization that caters to certain individuals. It's totally unfair to black actors and especially to black women. We as blacks are kept at a certain level the majority of the time. We have to totally sell out to get what we want. Sad but true
Tariji been giving her all for 20 years.  Yes her work will live on, but pay her dammit!
I only saw hustle and flow and Benjamin Button    her best role was hustle and flow
The math ain't mathing
"we don't translate overseas" they lying , I`m from RO, when a Michael B. Jordan / Denzel / Forest Whitaker / Morgan Freeman /  Samuel Jackson / Jamie Foxx / Laurence Fishburne / Don Cheadle / etc movie comes out the cinema is FULL. Get your money girl !
It's me Jose. Aguila. I understand your feelings  sometimes  people  put. So Much  efford in Their Craft  And Love Their Craft  Dont Get Respected  Not Only  As Actors But As A Human Beings. Tija Just to Let You Know That Your Not Alone  You Have People Behind  Im One Of Them Ok  I See Greatness In You But You Have To See It With In You Ok  Stay Away From Negative  People  And Youll Find  Happiness  With In You
OPRAH is Snake
It’s telling you diversify and invest in land and real estate  residual income is the answer 🔥
Why does the studio not pay for the freaking “ team” that is behind teraji to get paid, especially if it’s for their film? Girl, I love Teraji and I watch all her movies? Does Tyler perry do this to you to Teraji? Praying for you girl
I need to inbox 📥 her … this is a spiritual world 🌎and you gotta know what the elites know and hid so you /her/ anyone can rightfully get whatever they desire …
10/9/24 This is why companies don’t want you to discuss your salary with your peers. It’s unfortunate to find out how underpaid you are compared to your counterparts. Yes, we realize you receive what you agreed upon. Unfortunately, women of color have been lowballed. Some actresses may feel that $500,000 is a nice offer while their counterparts are being off millions. If a majority of black actresses accept that and feel like wow that’s a nice amount then that’s what they’ll offer. This won’t ever change until enough people speak up and join together to support one another. One or two people speaking up doesn’t garner any results but when everyone comes together in solidarity then it can slowly change. Danielle looked sad but also didn’t want to say the wrong thing.
It's all orapah fault
Imagine what we common worker get.
It means you aren't worthy of growing out of the box they have created for you, no matter what you do. The answer: Create
Give our queens the shine they deserve. These women hold up the world.
Where can I get the full episode?
Shes worth $12 Million
hearing her say the math ain't mathing reminds me of when left eye exposed the record label.
Baby don’t cry
I feel for taraji u dnt wanna b career most ur adult life n get paid Pennie’s for wat u worth find a better career of u need to or start ur own company
Beautiful ❤
Imagine what a average person feels 😂
😮😮 (my sister) , I  have been following you not on social media but your work . Person of interest was everything to us,  (my husband and I). You are underrated as an actor, to be recognized on Empire was the lowest of the low. After working so hard to establish yourself in serious series and being great in them, you get this ridiculousness 😢sis maan
You DON'T SEE actors like Julia Roberts COMPLAINING LIKE THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Thatvis Gayle King talking
I was So Here and In There in That Room on That Day This was Taped:  Monday, December 11, 2023.  Thank You Lord Jesus.  ✝
I am watching a movie on Bounce with Taraji P. Henson, who plays a golf coach. It's bringing me to tears. Heck! Daggonit@@, she should have won an Oscar for this role. OMG!! She is saying the same thing in the movie about her career challenges. I am boycotting the Oscar's until she wins her over due accolades. You watch the movie, then please join me.
We love you TARAJI!
this is sad, i love her
Taraji is a true QUEEN👑   it broke my heart to see her crying her eyes out over pay when at this point in her career, she shouldn’t be fighting this hard for the pay she earned. 💯🤦🏽‍♀️  Love you, Taraji🖤
why no white actresses complain ???...let the unions negotiate the right amount... ?????
1:57
Never retire, not yet, your too good of an Actor to stop now. I Love you Tarige😢you’ll be fine… you will receive what’s due you and MUCH MUCH more🥹🙏🏼❤️👵 The Grandma’ from Ohio
This woman’s net is 12 mill that’s it… do they not know who she is wtf give this woman her 100 mill she deserves..she probably signed the wrong contract idk what to say man
Wow - so upsetting to learn this.   My eyes are more open now - shocked at the salary difference between Terrance and Taraji.  i shared this with my son and his friend (18 yrs old) and thankfully they thought that was so wrong - hopefully their generation will bring about change.  I really like Terrance, but I bet if you did spin offs with just one of them in each, Cookie would be the winner!  Without Cookie, Lucious is another smooth, good looking man.  Without Lucious, Cookie is still a giant powerhouse of inspiration, realness, humor, and resilience. She is a fascinating firecracker.  Taraji/Cookie - Thank you!
Every person in every job thinks they should get paid more. Go be in a Marvel movie if you want bigger pay.
Sure she is what a bunch of nonsense 😂
We saw that with Cicely Tyson.
I hope God blesses her a lot more in the future and gives her courage to do more than she has already ❤🙏
Black women only fighting for themselves as usual
Her soul still got took. Cause she depended on the label. Instead of just branding off like she is. It’s not something you choose to do. It’s something you should b doing is rebranding and doing other things. 😢. Poor Henson.
It happens in other jobs too.
She was absolutely stellar in Hidden Figures and I live overseas.. so wtf are those studiobosses talking about. Damn, she is a gem and deserves so much more then be treated that dirty.
Wah wah wah
You deserve the world 🌍 you are amazing actress
TARAJI YOU ARE AMAZING AND I HOPE YOU ONE DAY GET THE EQUALITY AND PAY YOU ALL DESERVE. DON'T QUIT  ACTING IS YOUR CALLING ! YOUR WORK IS OUTSTANDING ❤
She a good ass actor to… Empire,Acrimony Tyler Perry movies
Maharaji’s on the def side dancing like a freak. 😂😂
It’s 2024 and the industry still lives in a rock
Taraji can cry which she has a right too, but everybody talks about Monique when she has an outburst. She called an angry hard to work it etc
@0:24-0:27 That was no mistake, that was intentional by @SiriusXM @1:29-1:37 She is a vet so why is she dealing with greedy people, why can't she just walk away and do business with other people who are willing to negotiate.
Hang in there. You one of my favourite actors you have class? You're intelligent, you beautiful, you black in your powerhouse. Don't never let nobody turn that found upside down. Continue to smile on all your haters.
I'm here from the UK because I LOVE Taraji P Henson in Person of Interest - absolutely she translates. She looks exhausted. :( Where is the class action suit because surely it's illegal to pay anyone differently because of their race or gender?  Would have been very happy to hear a lot more from her and a lot less from him too. :)
She’s over there crying but yet she paid $75,000 just to go to the Met Gala. These people know nothing about poverty!
Dang on it!!!!!!! I just said something to you about that on messenger!!! Wowww!!! I'm heated!!!
When you leave blackistan alone you get paid .
You didn’t have to accept the role…
Oprah Winfrey and Tryrer Perry are traitors because they took advantage if Monique and Taraji and other black sisters and brothers.
These people open themselves up to demons.
Some of us can’t even afford gas. She makes millions of dollars. What exactly does she want? Who is she competing against?
Why did I cry?! I love Taraji SM
I will be praying that you get whatever you deserve
Monique has already said this. Not to take anything from sister Taraji ❤
Why do women get paid less? Because they are less confrontational. Ask any famous actor at some point even they were subject to lowballing studios and producers. But most had the guts tosay pay up or i walk away. It´s risky of course but being a pushover did obviously not work for her. If she had negotiated harder maybe she would have gotten more money.
Go Strong Beautiful Lady 💪🙏
I guess ppl forgot how Hawaii was on fire yet Oprah's house remained "untouched" 🤔   If she's in on destroying land to remove others and devalue the land, what makes you think she cares about paying her staff accordingly?
Monique said she bought this up years ago💔 when will rhis end?
When you see a woman as successful as Taraji crying about the dealings in the industry, then you know that something is wrong.
This sucks, but quitting your livelihood won't improve your finances. Gotta be another way here.
MoNique won the Oscar. And Oprah Winfrey and Tyler Perry ruined her opportunities in Hollywood. Because she didn't want to promote the film Precious. Over seas Oprah Winfrey. Also brought Mo'Nique's whole family on her talk show. Her Mom and Dad said that the fame got to Mo's head. And that she has momey and is selfish. Oprah Winfrey can be so petty. And said on National television that Mo'Nique doesn't have a relationship with any of her family members.😂 They made sure to tranish her representation.
OPRAH  SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF HERSELF !!!
ONLYFANS INCUMMMINGGG!!!!!! WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWE
Give Taraji her money!
Thank you. This IS something to aspire to. Blessings to you all. This was a moment. One I needed.
I'M MAKING $13 AN HOUR I CAN'T RELATE...😂😂😂😂😂😂
From the first time, I saw Taraji‘s white hot Christmas show I was hooked on her. She is the whole package. She is sexy, funny as hell, and whip Smart. I can’t believe she’s been in the business for 20 years already and is still being treated, like she just came up and she’s 17 years old. And hearing that all her African-American peers are treated pretty much like her – – at least the women – – Hollywood in an ugly,  dark spot in my mind.
I hope she quits acting and does something more successful.
The hardest part about being a woman of color is having to take ownership for being different. You can be confident, accomplished, successful and be the person who has worked to deserve the opportunity, but because your image doesn't fit the "desired" narrative, you can easily be denied the opportunity or discriminated against. On one hand you want to be optimistic and extremely positive that your day and proper recognition will come; but on the other hand, a part of you may have to prepare for disappointments and rejections because historically the stats demonstrate that being different doesn't always translate with having access to certain opportunities or reaching a particular salary threshold.
Speaking your truth & hats off to you for speaking up. Sadly, you, & your fellow sisters & brothers that all are phenomenal actors and providing us with great tv are being scammed by several individuals who have preached so much about racist & slavery, but here there sitting on billions and paying you all chunk change as your all the valuable assets. You all need to stand together and fight for equal rights. The chain of prayer is already moving to bring all these powerful people who think they are untouchable to justice. Those who find themselves becoming rich due to greed & selfishness may you feel God slapping your hand saying shame on you, stop, taking food from those who sweat so hard for that paycheck.  May God always provide.... The ego and power blinds people and even allows them to forget where they came from and it's so sad. Stop taking advantage of all these beautiful, talented, dedicated, human beings who spend less time with there families so they can be providers to there children, but I guess when you don't have children you don't see that.  Stick together TJ & start declining underpaid projects you all know your worth. You all hold the key to there bank accounts. They didn't create you God did. Gather together and start that discrimination lawsuit, because don't forget only God knows what you leave in the bank. 2024 has started out by revealing many untold secrets & there's are still so many more that will be revealed to the light. God Bless you all, and may the good lord start whispering to all those who need to hear it humble yourself .. Prayers for OW, TP,  TJ, PD, JZ & many more blocking and causing harm to so many genuine, talanted people. You are all blocking your own community. We as an audience, as fans also suffer as well to hear these devastating news. Strength & Faith is all that's needed. Continue letting your voice be heard... Continue speaking your story on platforms and reveal these devious people wearing masks. Keep speaking your testimony to our ears so that we can support you, and stop supporting them. The fans continue to be blindsided from the darknest that's really going on behind the cameras.. I ask that we all continue to pray, continue to let your voice be heard, and eventually find healing on all the pain that is been caused..... Nobody can take your talent from you. Doors will open. Unite with others and put ya pennies together to create greatness... Your an amazing actress don't let nobody I mean nobody chase you away from what you have earned. You, Mo'nique, Viola, 50 Cent, Denzel, Eddie Murphy & so many many more are all so passionate and it shows in every role you play... Gayle you failed your sister during this interview because of OW shame on you but your behavior showed your audience exactly who you are as well. This is so sad coming from a huge fan who will not give another $1 to any  production that includes these people and if they don't take accountability and humble themselves and apologize may God pull the brakes where they need to be paused till things are made right..
Quit! Please!!
Good! 😂
Its called capitalism. You are paid what the demand is for.
You get what you negotiate.. Her movies don’t do well
Taraji I love you deeply, continue to stand up and hang in there lady
You & me both!!
I agree
The director ain't even American, Oprah loves hiring people that look like us. .,to play us
I make 15 dollars an hour 😂
Greetings, you ALL  have been heard on a very very very HIGH LEVEL. Thank you all for sharing. GOD BLESS YOU ALL!  NEVER STOP WHAT YOU LOVE.  😻😸😸🚀🪄🤑💚💜
Lost me when the director started talking...
While I understand Taraji's hurt, she really needs to realize that some movies simply do not sell/translate overseas. Does she watch foreign productions? Some foreign films can be sold in the US while others simply cannot.  Will "Color Purple" have a large audience in China? No, it does not translate there. Will "Color Purple" have a large audience in the Middle East? No, it does not translate there. In Australia and NZ? No, it does not translate there. In Europe? No, it does not translate there. Latin America? Also no. In Nigeria? Not even there. Why? Because the Nigerian local industry produces more films than Bollywood.   Now, can the studios sell movies, such as "Dune", to Asian, the Middle Eastern, European, and other markets? Most definitely! Movies like that DO translate overseas. If Taraji were in that movie, she WILL BE making a lot of money (assuming her team really fights for her).  Movies = products Products = sales  The more sellable/translatable movie is, the more money it generates everywhere (both domestic and foreign markets).  Finally, she lives in California, a state with incredibly high taxation.   It's simple Finance 101. What does she not understand?
To be honest Taraj is the best actress there is and it is so sad to hear that
Net worth: $12M
I love taraji but I'm sorry regardless you get more than most,  getting millions to act is a good gig, you might not get as much as the top notch actors but you get plenty stop it she worth 12 million dollars,  to make a movie or 2 a year
She is one of the most talented actresses of all time ❤ Cookie Lyon we love you 🔥
Expose all of them
Saying this about Zoe Saldana. No way she's not the highest paid female actross, today. Four of the top 10 highest grossing movies of all time, she's in!! 3 of them are sitting at the top and 2 of them she had a major starring role...!!
Doesn’t translate overseas. I feel like that’s a whole other can of worms and I want to hear about it.
These actors can choose to unite and form their own production companies, as others have done.
It's bs how they treat these people n Oprah is nothing but the devil her n tyler perry n they gone bust hell wide open ,keep pushing taraji
Why is it that Denzel isn't complaining? Never worked for Hollywierd, so I have no idea how the game works, but life is usually survival of the fittest. That's nature, in the wild. You have to build a "Safe Place", or home. Seems that some make a killing while most are hungry, just like everywhere else in life. Accountants have the same challenge, and don't make anywhere near the money. "Fairness" is a concept, not anything to count on. Ask a baby gazelle in the mouth of a lion. Ouch!!!
It must be awful being worth millions while playing pretend for the camera,i feel for you baby.    I would've traded jobs with you in a heartbeat. I worked HARD for 28 years breaking my ass in the heat during the summer and freezing cold in the winter and i don't have a 15 million dollar net worth. Your movies don't bring in billions like some do,be thankful for the wealth you do enjoy.
I can’t take a actor serious, they know how to go into character mode , not buying it
This director is a pro bullshitter
It tell me Hollywood is of the devil and he happy meals don't come with the gifts. If you all can use all those gifts to praise God, even if you cry weeping may endure only for a night but joy comes in the morning. And He will never put that day light out. Shine for God! Not baphomet. Jesus! See how He will wipe those tears away. Try Him.
I came from Katt Williams interview. She was phenomenal in Acrimony. My favorite work she did. Underrated.
Jehovah-Jireh is our provider HE WILL ALWAYS MAKE AWAY❤
bravo to that director for being so eloquent...so artistic...so pure.
She's not making any sense.
You translate over here in the African and African diaspora market too. Wth are they on about why would so many foreign emulate the Black American culture if you didn't translate well and resonate with audiences.
She’s so beautiful and strong! Wish her the best!
I know the feeling Taraji. I good through the same thing as an owner-operator.
And now look at the nepobabies. Who may be as talented and as hardworking but never have to worry about getting enough endorsements or side gigs because they just are so endlessly wealthy already. And they are seen as elegant and refined and immediately upper echelon A-list because they never had to shill for anything and could afford to say no to certain projects. 😢
This is some of the most ridiculous stuff I  have heard…. Did this man hear what Ms. Henson said…. She’s tired of amount of money for the work she has put in. There is an amount of money for a project the actors  do… WHAT THEY ARE WORTH….. He’s talking like Ms. Henson show be satisfied for her part of the production…. Nooooo!!!!!! She should get paid according to what she believes she’s worth… Ms Henson look around you…. The people who look like the understand what you’re feeling can be the one’s who are non-supportive of you when you don’t see them…..Be tire and mad about how “the industry” is treating you.
No you translate overseas as well.  The ceilings you’ve broken does matter and I pray that the industry does you justice.  You deserve that because you’ve worked hard and any movie role you make made the movie much better.
What I think a lot people are missing is she's an artist. And she's definitely not in a position to do her best work if the business end of it is a unfair environment..  I just want her to be free and happy to make the best movies...it's really that simple...this fucking sucks.
As someone from Australia, artists of colour absolutely translate overseas! People love seeing someone good at their craft, no one cares about fucking skin colour so there shouldn’t be an issue with paying what they deserve. Taraji is one of my favourite actors, she’s so incredibly talented.
He sure smoothed talked his way out of addressing that Taraji didn't get paid. She don't need flowers she can't use flowers to eat she need to be paid.
Self employment is the only way. Stop waiting for anyone to offer u or sign ur checks, do it ur way fo it the hard way. Life  will fuck us a million ways if we let it, stop expecting others to give u a mafakunthing
It's time to finally talk about it. She is an incredible actress!
man this brings me to tears
Taraji hon god be with u if anything hon make a buisness sweety
Mo’nique is chiilin somewhere saying i told y’all!
And to think she didn't receive an Oscar for Hidden Figures is beyond me. That is insane. Make it make sense.
B….. say no thanks to the part
Its so weird bc i thought she was like an A-lister, like among the top tier actors. Its sad to see her sufferings.
Rich people complaining that they aren't getting rich enough...😂 You've been in the game 20 years, has businesses and endorsements but that's not enough. Would you guys say no to $500,000 and walk away empty handed, or take the money and keep it moving...the numbers they talk about are wild. Meanwhile, the people who work blue collar jobs work their asses off and are underpaid but they seem to live with it...make that make sense.
I swear to f**king God, her speech in Hidden Figures about how her character has struggle to go to the bathroom hits very differently and feels even more truthfully real since seeing this.
Lol She ruined that movie. Ut was supposed to be historic. Taylor and Oprah do not have the money that white men do. They are trying to build something. She is being greedy with her own people. She would never say that to Steven Spielberg.
i really REALLY hope this changes the way these movie studios behave. i highly doubt it will, thanks to the shift to AI. but at least strong women like taraji and monique are on the right side of history, speaking against injustice.
I respect Taraji 🎉❤
I’m team Taraji allll day, but why would Gayle bring up a negative question knowing her BFF has Executive produced the movie and needs it to do well….then they blame Taraji for talking about it but she was asked…I don’t like Gayle or Oprah but it seems unfriendly of Gayle
Everyone that was blackballed should stick together create a better oxygen no corruption
Did he say “we” have to be “brave?!” But no names were called. Who is “They?!” Unless you are specific, you cannot pressure entities to be accountable. Taraji, stop beating around the bush. If you need to fight, then fight. Be direct. YOU are the talent. YOU are the star. YOU are the entity THEY are making money off of. I think she doesn’t want further suffering. She saw what happened to Mo’Nique. So she has to make a choice. The issue is structural. Y’all need to stand up, in my opinion.
The only thing that isn't mathing is a Millionaire 12 TIMES over crying & playing victim in a world where 70% of people live on less than a dollar a day, a world where thousands of communities lack access to clean water. Children dying of hunger. She should get over herself and stop looking at her neighbours wallet and appreciate what she has got instead of being ridiculous.
.    What does    8-8 LAHAINA     GANSTABOO               &         OPRAH have in common   CHARLES MANSON SUPERSTAR REDUX               YouTube
I think they need better financial accountants and advice!!! because they make a lot of money what about the ones that live paycheck to paycheck making minimum wages and still can pay all there bills but they can’t live above there means and maybe that’s the problem these celebrities want to be greedy and live above there means but u can’t!!!
You can’t blame anyone but your own community for this. Every time Monique has had an issue it’s been with her own community.
Poor women, we need to give her everything.  Being in the business not knowing the business.  Poor woman
We Love you here in Mozambique, Africa! we love you queen
We can talk about being brave, we need people who don’t look like us to change perspective or LEAVE. :/ Neither seems realistic.
She always has the right to say, "No." If she feels the pay is unfair , she can always change her Career. Or, she could work on her own projects and leave Hollywood behind her.
It was riDICUlous that Taraji had to sit there and swallow what she really wanted to say because of Gayle. It's unfortunate for Monique that she went first, as the first whistleblower is usually dismissed as trivial, but now another gutsy woman is coming forward. Go Taraji!!!!!
Monique and Viola Davis was saying this long ago.... And like Monique said it's the messenger. SMH 😒
My heart breaks for her. She is such an amazing actress and I can't stand how she and so many have to fight for every dollar they get. I also don't understand why big names like Oprah and Tyler Perry can do this to people from their own background and culture. You would think that those who made it would help those who come after. So instead they do everything they can to keep them down and broke. If they speak up they get black balled!
Taraji is one of my favorite actresses… it’s so sad to see such talent have to struggle… feel for you girl 🤗🥰
No one i know has ever seen anything taraji henson has been in. sounds like her compensation is proportional to her marketability.
You gonna forever be tired cause you serving the devil.
Kendrick said it, "...you ain't getting it, until you pay Jews."
I don’t think people comprehend the expenses of this career…..
😭💔😭💔... Auntie Mo was right all along.
Let’s keep it real! If we see ANY movie previews with Taraji in it, we are watching it!!!!!!!!!’ THE END…. I love you girl keep your head up and faith strong!! Your time is now here!!! ❤🙏
I so much love this Lady Taraji that I instantly gets glued to any movie I see her face. Why should anyone treat her like this? Shame on them movie producers 👎👎
She gets paid millions to act and she's crying about it?
Taraji is awesome. Pay her what she is worth
So basically he said in soft words T stop bitching, cause the rewatching should be the biggest reward you should long for
This dude is deliberately downplaying Taraji’s point…and efforts.
hmmmmm,mmmhmmmm
Honest ppl struggle while those who lie sceme and steal make millions. Even "regular " ppl go through this. This system is BUILT on lies not honestly
Where's her wedding 💍😢
Seems like Hollywood is like corporate American, men get paid more in everything!!
Normally when I hear stuff like this it’s always coming from someone extremely wack or avg.  so I don’t care.  Taraji is ridiculously talented though and is definitely a draw.  Hopefully she gets what she feels is due.
People fought to not have her appear?  🤢
when you decide to shuck and jive for elites that never cared what do you expect to happen?
I love her as an actor but we are always fighting to get into someone else’s door when we should have been building our own. Hollywood will remain the same when we are no longer here. Middle class America dictates what we usually watch and 99% of the time that drives what Hollywood puts out. So until that changes black men and women will always get the short end of the stick. From a black males perspective the only role we get in box office movies are the villain, gangster, flamboyant, comedian, or someone in need of help. Because that is what makes them feel comfortable. If we based reality on movies then there is no such thing as a black hero or a black man that can successfully raise a family and actually have some function to his life. And if we do get leading roles of that nature they will get someone from the UK. We have to learn to stop begging when the obvious is true. This is the reason why people like Taraji can work 10x harder and still have to negotiate from the bottom because they feel like they are doing us a favor by just including us. It’s unfortunate but just the cold hearted truth.
What the f*** is going taraji Peterson is a f****** wonderful beautiful talented talented talented woman and that is so disrespectful that she has to go through what she's she with respect of what her talent that she shares with the world always going to be supportive and I love you so much and you keep fighting okay because God has your back 1 trillion * just like how much money she should get paid cuz in reality we all know that she's a bad woman and she is very talented and beautiful so give her her money give her her bags and stop being a hater and let that lady continue on her path of greatness God bless ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Sadly this reverberates across ALL businesses ,,,We are still viewed as the Help in the kitchen
Who else came straight here after watching mo’nique’s interview on Shay Shay
Something about what he had to say wasn't quite connecting with her complaint.
Who's here after that interview with Mo~nique in club Shay Shay
But Monique told yall and people dogged her for saying it.
Flowers don't pay bills bro
Brilliant in Smokin Aces
0:21 not the audacity, excuse me
Go from 0 to 2 million after taxes and team and crying.  An llc cost 100 dollrs in every state.  A contract being crafted cost 2500 tops.  An operating agreement cost 200 or less.  Getting all this things done without a lawyer and just have them reviewed cost much less.  Black people have been made the victims of society and they carry on as such.  Where are the pro active people.  With activated consciousness for activism.  Stop crying and do some bih.
Monique was right and they blacklisted her.
Sorry what is he talking about, she is talking about equality and he is talking about inspiring people… He is watching his words for masa
Time to boycott and unite together 💯. Hollywood would not survive without us
She is one bad actor I love her…. What a sad thing 😢
Gail probably thinks like Oprah. She doesn’t give a damn about Taraji😢
It’s sad when you work for a well known producer , director etc you work to make money for them . Taraji you can do bad by yourself as those who can and won’t produce you the funds you need for travel clothing’s makeup and hair workers only to not be paid to live. As your faces on screen is all over the world . That’s said it’s like your $50,000. Is like working for just $20 per hour
Funny, how none of them stood up for Stacey Dash when they blacklisted her for being a Christian. Where were the tears then?
Look at what she is saying from a macro level.  Imagine being one the best athletes, the best doctors, the best lawyers, the best at your profession.  You know what everyone else is making and you get paid 50-60% less.  Its not just about the money, its about the respect.
As of yet, Ms. Henson and Mrs. Barrino  lack the celebrity of a "main stream" actress. Their degree of national and international renown, in tandem with their box office earnings as lead actresses, just aren't sufficient to justify the sum of money their requesting.   Despite Ms. Henson's many achievements— [nominated for a 2008 Academy Award for best supporting actress (The Curious Case of Benjamin Button) her marketing appeal typically caters to urban audiences.   Despite its Broadway production success, and being directed by Blitz Bazawule,  produced by prominent industry figures Quincy Jones, Scott Sanders, Steven Spielberg, and Oprah Winfrey, the Color Purple (2023 Film) has been an overall box office failure, earning approximately $62 million dollars worldwide against roughly a $100 million budget. The films production budget was allocated by Warner Bros. (50%), Harpo Films, (20%) Domain Entertainment (10%), Amblin Entertainment (10%), SGS studios(5%) , Quincy Jones Productions (5%).  Similar to other profit-driven businesses, the film industry needs to make prudent financial decisions. Simply put, Mr. Henson and Mrs. Barrino don't have the national popularity or box office appeal to support their outrageous salary request.
People are out here starving and can barely avoid to eat everyday and these privileged actors out here crying about not getting paid enough to act. They're net worth is at least a million
Gail is holding back a lot because she already knows if she cross Oprah it’s over for her, so she’s not asking a lot of questions because I believe she’s afraid of what will be said… smh
We love you TPH
STRIKE-STRIKE-STRIKE……. WITHOUT BLACK WOMAN, HOLLYWOOD WILL SUFFER
Her cause is real. But I mean... i liked "baby boy" too, but she aint no Regina King, Regina hall, Angela Bassett.
I love ❤️ Taraji…she’s so beautiful and talented. I felt her pain when she started crying, it’s hard to know you deserve more and are tired of fighting. Pretty sure we can all resonate with that feeling. What an amazing woman with an incredible career. ❤
I love Taraji. I first seen her in the series Person of Interest and absolutely loved her she's a great actress who makes u feel for her characters
Oprah is all over the screen patting herself on the back, but why are the payscales on HER movie janky?! Oprah's been a fake for YEARS now. She's not really trying to take anybody alo g bc she wants all the spotlight 😐
I know Im about to make sure I give a wink and shout out to the air line folks!
Taraji was paid 10 million for the color purple and she wants to cry and complain , please.....entitled people never cease to amaze me
Mo the MVP.
I hope she stops using face fillers and whatever, it doesn’t look good. Black women age well without that crap, damn Hollywood. Vivica A Fox’s face looks puffed out too.
The most biggest bullcrap I have seen in this I swear 😂😂. Dude at first I was like “yeah it tells me that if I do something then I might not get the credit” but like here is where I’m coming from. From a biblical perspective she is showing how ungrateful she really is. First off, the money she gets paid will always be more than the average women working a 9 to 5 regardless!!! And yet she is upset because she is not getting the same amount as others? The Bible even shows an example of this same issue of a guy complaining about working in a field longer than someone else and yet was showing ungrateful emotions as well!!! I can’t relate to her period!! You mean to tell me that because you get paid millions compared to most average people in the world and you are able to get your hair done, wear outfits, gets your nails done, travel the world, live in a house, not worry about bills, not worry about health insurance, not worry about lack of transportation, have all of the resources money could get you to have someone teach you to make your own business or whatever, know how to pray and reach God, and yet she is crying over the many years she has worked in Hollywood for not being paid enough?! Ladies and Gentlemen this is an example of feeling entitled, end of story. She could have used what she got paid for the make the best of something, AND she should have been thanking God that she at least got something. Quote on quote “African Americans” (like myself in a sense of identifying my “race”) have been learning to roll with the punches and doing with what we got for a long time now, she has no reason to be upset and ungrateful because at the end of the day she is RICH!!!! No, money is not able to buy happiness, but you don’t need affirmation, credibility, or validation from any human being period within this planet. Had she would have (really) known who she is in Christ Jesus she would have understood that within this lifetime only credit should belong to God, that in knowing who you are in Christ Jesus you learn that unfairness in this world is due to sin and that you just thank and praise God through the good and bad because bad will come, you learn to value the things God ALLOWS to happen in your life because he didn’t have to and no human is OWED ANYTHING in the eyes of God, and that there is more opportunity in life than your carrier. What is she upset for? She could have done what Tyler Perry did and made her own studio,hired actors, made buildings, and creat her own contract, but instead she mostly stuck with acting which is fine but don’t complain or get upset about how you get “cheated” when the amount that you get is no where near compared to the average Joe.
Boo hoo! 🤣🤣Ms. Henson's tears don't move me in the least. The movie and television industries are a business, first and foremost. The numbers do not lie. Actors are paid according to mareketability and potential financial payoff. Ms. Henson has been told the truth by the studio heads that pay her salary. Actors like Taraji simply don't deserve the financial compensation they believe they deserve. I refuse to empathize with actresses like Ms. Henson who have been paid millions of dollars over the course of their careers and complain about not being paid enough.
Oprah probably hired her out of pity
Unfortunately it comes from the type of roles she plays. She’s a fierce actress but her style pidgeonholes her.
The truth hurts, but here goes: nobody goes to see a movie because Taraji Henson is in the cast. Nobody. People will go to the theatre to see Tim Cruise, Will Smith, The Rock, Leo Dicaprio etc. So those actors get the big bucks. Their presence in the films helps make a lot of money at the box office. The same can not and will never be true of Henson. She is doing the typical black woman cry baby routine, oh racism, oh oppression, oh low wages etc etc and I am sick of it. If you want more money, then get lead roles and show that you being in a lead role in a movie helps the movie make a lot of money at the box office. If you can’t do that, then be happy with the money you are currently making. There are many who don’t get any roles.
She have good movies shit she made empire she made hustle and flow. Stop playing 🫡😂
“If I can’t fight for them coming behind me wtf am I doing “ felt that real hard man….
It’s some evil things going on in the entertainment industry
Did Gayle come on too strong asking that question ?
Miss Henson. The reason God deceived da devil into robbing u of all ur Oscars. Is b'coz He wanted u today, to be standing up & advocating for sisters & ppl of color. There was always a huge purpose on u dear & still is.. 🫶🌹#love.u.taraji
I just seen a video that said taraji was dead?
She could've said "I want to talk about the film & how hard all the cast worked." Save her personal struggle comments for during commercial, the kitchen table OR negotiations before production.

Wow 😲 amazing...
I'm in New Zealand 🇳🇿 and can safely say Mrs Taraji Henson wr may be the farest away from yall and I can say quite CLEARLY, GIRL!!!!! YOU ARE TRANSLATING 🎉❤
i love to see millionaires cry about not getting extra millions
Then just quit and be gone tired about hearing all this bs on my news feed dont like the pay find a different profession you chose this  was a big fan not anymore tired of the cry babies in hollywood u make more in a film then half of us will ever see in our lives now if your cost of living is too high thts a you problem like the rsst of it just be gone have a nice day
Until we come together under unity and understanding they we always win
Love your acting you deserve better
"The math isn't mathin'."  OK...what's the math?
her transparency is so insightful and honest. I admire her so much.
I felt your pain Queen!!🫂💔❤️‍🩹
Her movie flopped
Gayle so fake, she know what her girlfriend(BFF) doing. Stop it
Systemic racism is a thing in America!
The math ain't mathin for sure, your last 2 movies were flops but you want  to be paid more! There is no job that rewards non/under performance with a raise. 🤔
She knowingly accepted the pay & contract before filming. She was not forced against her will to do this project....
I feel bad for her (a millionaire) but it's hard to feel really bad when the local store cashier can't stand to pay for a random health emergency.
Been going through the same thing as a black  female actor in Australia! 25years of the same struggle.   It breaks your soul alright.
In Hollywood, you are paid what you are worth. Life is tough. Her crying and complaining isn't going to get her anywhere.
😂😂😂😂😂😂
She needs a better accountant. Her total tax bill (federal, state, FICA) etc is indeed about 5 million but nobody witha decent accounttant pays that.   There are so many ways to claim credits, rebates that even with paying an accountant, you will end up paying less  As for her team, this may sound weird but there is a rreaason why Oprah team actially work for oprah company nd not her directly
Poor Taraji with a net worth of $12 million. Boo hoo. Go get a EGOT and I bet them numbers will change.
Monique said it
Dear Taraji, please not worry, your royalties is endless. you wlll be paid in full
End of the day you gotta set up shop outside the states
This just broke my heart to see my baby cry. I pray lord you protect her and her family. Let their souls not be touched in Jesus name. Thank you Taraji for listening to your spirit and then your heart all for God's glory.
This breaks my heart.
Why do they always ask them if they wanna quit?...is it right? It's not about quiting it's about calling out the BS happening around these stars, getting to what's rightfully theirs is what's more important.
Poor thing. We love you T❤❤❤
You definatelty translate overseas. Because we are ALL human. ❤ 🇬🇧🇯🇲🇨🇦❤
I may not be making millions but i’m fighting the same battle! I feel you! i’m with you. If you stay strong I will too! #staystrong @taraji ❤ you!! we got this
I think she should quit.  If she is unhappy - she should quit.  Mental health is more important.
Something has happened in Hollywood these people are tired. Overseas? Lol and only half she thinks she's only getting half na theyre taking more than half these people playing with most of the money in the world nothing but greed addiction killings suicides rituals gangs everything lol
This brother just sold out his sisters talking doing this for healing. Brother you should be advocating for these queens, especially Taraji P Henson
Damn.
Monique said it first 👀
The color purple was a flop so i wouldn't say she deserves the same pay when it comes to this.
I know the feeling; it doesn't feel good, and it isn't right!
She’s listening to nothing he’s saying it’s not relevant to how they’re going to fix it.
Oprah Thats all I have to say.
She is beyond talented.
If taraji p Henson wants to leave acting she can very well help other actors get what they need and other people in various industries received the proper pay and their rights. She can return to acting at any time and get behind the camera and produce and get her own production company and record label for things she wants to see out there. If studios aren't treating you properly, you become a studio and treat people the way you know they should be treated according to the moral biblical standard. You can complain officially publicly, you can rebuke, and you can also model how it should be done with your own company.
Was is this thing about not translating overseas? Can someone elaborate?
So nobody cares until it happens to them
It's telling you that acting in Hollywood is stupid
JOHN 3:16 FOR GOD SO LOVED THE WORLD, THAT HE GAVE HIS ONLY BEGOTTEN SON, THAT WHOSOEVER BELIEVETH IN HIM SHOULD NOT PERISH, BUT HAVE EVERLASTING LIFE.
Taraji  negative press run cost The color purple movie success.
So Sammy Davis Jr and all those African Americans who fought for equal pay has only amounted in 2023 to Rich Black Producers taking them back to the 1920s and treating them like Amos and Andy and Gone with the Wind? I feel ashamed to even support such movies including Tyler Perry or Oprah Winfrey.
Black people’s Joe Rogan right here 👏
Wow! We all knew it but to hear it said.
Oprah fighting for equality for Black people all those years only to be the one suppressing Black people. Typical. She has a God complex. Like a true NARCISSIST. Fight on my talented Black sisters!
SiriusXM was like: Nice, CONTENT!!😂
You have a fraction of the skill and talent of Julia Roberts. Therefore, you get paid a fraction of what she is worth.
she is an ok actress and made a lot of money doing it. Stop crying, you made millions. These people make me sick.
Don't be mad, UPS is hiring.
Taraji you're a Real one and Real ones belong with other Real ones . That's what it's telling you.
The music industry is even worse. But this happens across all industries.
This is deeper than what she is sharing. Taraji get out. Your peace of mind is necessary!
I’m witchu sister💯🙏🏽
Listening to Gayle makes me sick
My heart goes out to her.
Sooo sad she did the movie for them now
What a great actress, we love you. And she should be top dollar paid
Sadly, due to the box office it looks like she was overpaid this time. There is nothing wrong with career changes.
As a native Washingtonian, Latina, I hold a special place in my heart for Taraji. She (unlike most celebrities) got her degree in engineering and went for acting. I was told by the elder aunties growing up I would have to work 3x harder to just be noticed. They just had two big Hollywood strikes that froze Hollywood and they still demand more from their actors ($, resources, time). I'm so GLAD Taraji has something else to fall back on when Hollywood is giving her bull. Always improve yourself and have an exit strategy ❤
I dont know how people interpret that Taraji was taking about Oprah. I'm so confused af it seems like she's talking in general. After putting blood sweat and tears for years and still not satisfied its very frustrating. She doesn't want the next generation to go through what she going through thats all. People talk to much bs frfr.
When TH speaking the panel is agreeing.  Watch the panel later in interviews I pray the panel sticks with TH and Monique and be truthful.
Woman should quit acting after the spectical she has made. She's a charcter actor or ensemble lead in low budget films that lose money. But wants Samuel L Jackson money, yet doesn't bring in Samuel L Jackson money for studios.  If you have a role and Halle Barry, Angela Basset and Taraji P Henson are all asking for the same amount of money who are you picking? Known box office draws with success? Or Taraji? You going to pay Taraji $10 for a reboot of Sister Act? Because back in the Day Whoopi made $7 mil? You're not Whoopi. What you think you're worth and what you're name is worth as a box office Draw, are two very different things.  Women's earned $25 million and complains she only has a net worth of $15 million because of Taxes and paying her hairstyles and make up artist. Life is tough.
Magin all the black actors left Hollywood and started their own...  Made it way better and hired actors of all races and paid them their worth
Ye tried to tell you who’s making all the money off us.
Why the #SagAftraStrike happened.
Let's face facts, for a moment. Taraji mentions how much she got paid for Benjamin Button, right? You know the two biggiest movies she did PRIOR to Button? Baby Boy (which no one ever watched for her....they watched for Snoop Dogg and Tyrese....No one ever turned on Baby Boy to watch Taraji), and Hustle and Flow, where she wasn't even the female lead in that movie....that's it....everything else she did was bit part. She needs to realize that's she only RECENTLY became famous. Empire and Hidden Figures are the real reason she's famous....that's it. That's what makes her main stream. What did she have before that...the female lead in a bunch of Tyler Perry movies?? Yeah...pretty much might as well be straight to cable releases....doesn't matter how long you've been around, as the body of your WORK, and her body of work, at the time, wasn't great. Face facts, Taraji....you're crying over not being that good in the past.
I actually would never hire her after this mess.  ~ Unpopular opinion: 1. Josh Brolin didn’t get paid for No Country for Old Men but the role garnered an Academy Award nomination and led to high paying roles. So it happens to everyone. 2. If I was a producer I’d never hire Taraji after this publicity stunt with The Color Purple and here’s why. Promoting the movie is part of you getting hired for the job. It’s build in. Taraji and her agent accepted the pay after negotiating with the producers, the people who risks the most to make the film. If she doesn’t like her pay, talk to your agent and set boundaries. This is NOT Oprah’s fault. Taraji spent the promotion for The Color Purple complaining and crying. This was unprofessional. It’s not about you. It’s about the movie. She would never do this with a white producer but felt comfortable criticizing Oprah publicly, the women who hired her and used her money to create opportunities for you and other black actresses to work. If I was Oprah I would use caution when hiring black women actresses because they have backstabbed her twice and affected her bottom line. Oprah deserved better. No one will agree because it’s not your money, black culture is oftentimes toxic, the truth is nonexistent and righteousness is dead.
The crazy part is she speaking on the entertainment industry, But her gripes go across the entire spectrum when it comes to black women or black people in general in the work place!! We ALL feel ur pain baby girl✊🏾
Guess Mo'nique was right after all...
For all the people that discredited Monique for being a b i t c h maybe you might want to rethink that
This is the second time Oprah's name has been connected to something like this. She also had a 10-year feud with Whoopi Goldberg. Sometimes what you want people to be is not who they truly are. Julia Roberts would not have showed up to a movie and been handed a rental car key and a coffee from the gas station. Oprah should have known better, Steven Spielberg should have known,Quincy Jones should have known it must be very insulting to be treated like the cleaning lady.
Taraji is ungrateful..shes worth 12million dollars and complaining about money...she is just greedy.
so if she quits acting, what is she going to get a normal job? What could possibly pay her more than acting? She’s just comparing her paycheck to everyone else. I’m sure she’s still a millionaire.
Can someone help me understand this? Why didn't Taraji cry when Universal and Keith Chapman didn't give her a raise? Why is she only calling out Oprah? Her attempt to bring Oprah down is akin to the same reason Will Smith slapped Chris Rock – COWARDLY BEHAVIOR.
Taraji don't you dare backtrack! You have been choosen to fight this fight, just like Monique. Do what you have been called to do by the supreme!  We have to remember that many of our "so called" greats were groomed by others in these industries that have turned out to be unsavory.  Can unsavory characters teach us valuable lessons? Absolutely!  But, we have to know which lessons, from these individuals, to integrate into our playbooks and which ones to let go because they kill spirits and damage souls. I stand with you my sister, we all do, don't you dare stop until this work is done!❤
I didn't watch the dude with the hat talk lmao, just the first half
Good lord, this sister one of the best in the whole industry n she being treated like this... It breaks my heart. Black people are marketable overseas! You know how many countries have hella black people?!? Really?!?
She’s an incredible actress and the studios need to make the pay comparable to the gross profits the film studio makes. It’s all about %’s. The US taxation system is a disgrace. Who the hell has the right to just take 50% of your hard earned pay and for what? The privilege of living in the USA? With no free health care. Country is a joke.
Im SO confused......Oprah is a black woman but she's extremely popular and successful and filthy rich , right??? So, maybe skin color and gender are'nt the reasons that  Tariji only has , say, $12 million dollars US, in her bank account.
Her and Oprah killed that movies success
No one is going to cast her again. Complaining about driving to your job ?? Is it in your Sag contract ?? I’m curious
So heartbreaking 💔  That is why she had to be her own boss and run a company  Fuck hollyweird and they’re measly hand outs
Im tripping on her beauty. 53 where? Her voice even sounds young. The young adults and teens from the 90's going out with a bang. Their still relevant today. Katt Williams all these ppl 50 and up
How much money does her movies make? I feel sorry for her really. She needs more hits and bigger hits.
The problem is not that she is getting paid less, the problem is the deal she has with her so calked team that's killing her. Even if she made 20 mill uncle sam would take 10 mill, her team 6 leaving her only only with 4.

If a job not laying u right... get another job. That's what normal people do
Why did Gayle ask that question? That just opened the floodgates
What she saying is true, I work a lot and I mean a lot. So I thought I could go and ask for a raise, I was looked at like I was going to get. In fact I was coached by the director of the lab to go and talk to my boss in what to say. When I did using the words that he told me to say my boss was agreeing with me 100%. So I left with so much joy and happiness it was measurable, I have never done anything like that before NEVER EVER. I was told they would talk to me on Wednesday, so Wednesday came I had to ask because 1. I felt like they we're dogging me, 2. They weren't wanting to talk to me at all. So I asked with a smile and I got this "Yes but No", I felt my breath leave my lungs and I know my face said what I couldn't. So yes I know what she is talking about less then not enough. 😢😭😭
Wish the interviewer will shut up and let them speak. She's stopping the flow. Ask your question when they finish
She is such a wonderful performer and to hear this is just disgusting.  She deserves much more respect than this.
If she had a problem with the way that Uncle paid her for the color purple that she shouldn't have accepted the role! Taraji was good in the movie but I found myself really missing the original Sugar Avery. 🤷
Black don't crack it does not apply here
Don't stop acting. Go to G-Unit Studios and build wit 50. Or find another company that's gonna pay u what they should. That's to logical I guess
She’s need a better manager and a better accountant. When billionaires pay less taxes. Then normal people.
🤷🏿‍♀️Damn, Oprah gave away more to the people in her show audience then the actors in this movie. She cold-blooded, told everybody "you get a car, you get a car, you get a car...but told the set "Hold up, not yall tho". Maybe God is trying to tell people to stop working for Oprah. She told us Mister was the problem, but it looks like everything she think about should be failing too. 🫵🏿
If the pay is not correct turn down the job .
She probably will be paid around $500k max after everything.
I stand with them all getting fair pay, definitely but these people are also crying over millions of dollars, while people who work 9-5 have it so much worse. Average everyday people have to argue for higher pay, and make 15-20 an hour working a lot harder than these performing arts industry jobs. No, you’re not getting the whole 10 million dollars but to even get paid THAT for your work alone is mind boggling, while average people make 1-2k every 2 weeks or so and have bills and major responsibilities too. We should be the ones crying and begging
she did a bad job as shug. Plus her and fantasia were too old to play these roles.  They picked fantasia cause she looks slow. Taraji is stealing the spotlight for fantasia breakout role
I'm feeling her I myself have been in her shoes, right now I'm retired and it's a shame what they give you verses what you know what you should be getting , and mind you this is 40 years + working so I understand Ms. Henson and don't stop keep fighting it will be well worth it . Remember with you God didn't make a mistake he will allow you to shine, the way he intended, because he hears the cries of his daughters ❤️
All these millions and people are actually emotional for this woman. All of y'all feeling bad for her don't even have as much money combined as her.
Omg, I love Taraji, and I had no clue the industry was like that.
Taraji can turn down the roles if she doesn’t like the money!!! Just like a 9 to 5 worker, don’t take the job if you don’t like the pay. I can’t stand a rich person complaining.  She is worth 12 mil, she needs to simply shut up!!!
Based on what she said, she is drawing down 3 mil. I can’t feel anything about what Taraji is claiming.
A millionaire privileged actor is outraged because actors who are bigger stars that draw more money get paid more?! Shock horror. Cry me a river. Get a real job sweetie. Try living in the non-privileged real world. I’m gonna go on a press tour crying because my manager makes more than I do.
Taraji is one of my favorite actors every time I see her on film my heart skips a beat because she delivers. Don’t give up Taraji!
sound like Uncle Sam the problem... lets not ignore that
"IF I CAN'T FIGHT FOR THE ONE'S COMING UP BEHIND ME, WHAT THE F#CK AM I DOING" That brought a tear to my eye.  Smh, sighed.
She was to good for that trash music show whatever it was called..and as far as not translating  overseas I'm a pasty white dude from the bottom of southland New Zealand and I would definitely watch something just because she was in it... Hollywood bigwigs are the worst humans we have.
Monique told everyone that would listen and most thought she was making it up. No No No. The TRUTH IS ALWAYS THE TRUTH.
Hey you know who has it rough , the police, firefighters, teachers,
very talented actress
Why wouldn’t Oprah pay em?
Wow we love u
Its crazy Monique was saying the same thing but in a different way with a different delivery and she got dragged. Maybe because she didnt cry? Maybe because she had the same energy of anger that she played in the movie precious. Dont uplift Tarahji and out down Monique uplift them both. The sadder part is its mostly women with the negativity.
If the team gets gets 30% off the top, then Uncle Sam is not taking 50% off the gross but off the net..The math ain't mathing because she's not even trying to do it right.
I love Taraji.. So many amazing roles... This is upsetting
Stop crying because you think you get underpaid what about the people who’s jobs that actually matter and  get paid peanuts
Dude talks too much!
That’s all women in different industries. Never get paid what a man makes. I’ve worked in what was considered a man’s profession. I worked just as hard if not harder and never got the same pay.
I personally dont like how the interviewer started the conversation with you have the audacity if a person life earning and career is effecting them emotionally and financial no one should approach the person in such a negative tone have some compassion and empathy for Queen Taji She dont owe the world an explanation but she did so I appreciate her soul and well-being so some respect to black people and the Human Race
highest tax bracket is like 38 percent. how is uncle sam taking so much from her?
Seems like a whole lot of complaining to me. Hire smart lawyers to negotiate those contracts, good PR teams to secure endorsements, advertisements etc. Heck even try start your own production company with all the years of experience you have and become a director. FIND WAYS to crack the matrix. Complaining won’t get you anything.
I love Taraji and I do appreciate her honesty but we got to stop having this sense of entitlement. You can’t always expect people to have your back or your best interest.   There are times I feel like I should be paid more than I’m worth at my job, however I love what I do and I’m passionate in what I do so I really don’t care about having more money,  I just need we just need to learn how to steward the money better and just keep it moving.
Yall need to stop ....If after all her expenses are paid and she has a million dollars ...that is way better than what we see in years. Invest your money make it grow be greatful. Wish I could cry over a million dollars out of 10 mill
BIG UP MONIQUE
They probably doing this to her because she's refusing to do house calls for these powerful people.   Quid pro quo has long been the status quo and standard in all of entertainment industry and it's sad.
This shit is goofy. She’s rich, and we’re meant to give a shit she isn’t getting even more? I get it, she wants to be paid more, everyone does. But she’s not a movie star. Her Empire success never really translated to box office success. She comes off the success of Hidden Figures with Proud Mary, and Proud Mary bombs. The Color Purple bombed. The Best of Enemies was a little movie and couldn’t even make its budget back. Her only real success in movies since Hidden Figures seems to be the What Women Want remake: What Men Want.
What a load of BS, Accepting the job and then crying about how they ain't paying you enough is just too much of a woman thing to do, if you don't like how much they are paying you, say No. it's either another actor is gonna replace you or you are just that good they're gonna pay you more. 🤷‍♂
The bigger you get the speciation are get higher…$$$$$$
Damn Yvette where Jodi at
When Monique spoke about this years ago they called her difficult and crazy then black balled her. If they had stood behind her and supported her this wouldn't be happening today!😢
I remember working at a daycare one time. I had no prior experience with kids age 5 and under. All I had was a Bachelors degree. I spoke with a daycare worker who worked there for more than 25 years. She was the BEST person there and knew her shit. I learned that I was making way more than her and that the organization never honored her requests for a raise. In this case, I know that education level is factored in for pay,  but it’s crazy how hard women of color have to fight to earn what they’re worth.
Who are “they” Kanye?
Why didn't the producers of this film pay her more? Why didn't Ms. Henson take this issue up with the WEALTHY people producing the film? Why doesn't she mention BY NAME the people / producers that are holding her back?? I don't understand this issue...WE KNOW WHO PAYS THE ACTORS.
I love hearing people who play make believe all day use the word “work” so many times. They are breaking. As if they are out in the hot sun breaking bricks all day. Go out and get what you were worth. And if they are not willing to see what you’re worth and don’t do the job. Simple as that.
The Color Purple has bombed at the theaters and is on track to LOSE $100 Million. It didn't even make enough at the box office to covering it's Marketing and advertising Costs. But Taraji thinks she should've gotten paid MORE even though she can't sell tickets? Stop it.
The pay is only a fraction of the dark stuff that happens in Hollywood it's sad
Yes, am sure there are many "costs" to being an actor/actress. This woman is fantastic and certainly one of the best. Not many get to where she is; She's certainly one of my favorite! If she's in it, I want to see it. Know that so many love you and your work. ❤ Thank You for what you have given us. Be happy with whatever you choose to do in life.
I love you Taraji. Always have always will!
I definitely understand how she feels , not being paid fairly but still having to buckle down and going to work because others depend on her. My prayers are going out to that Queen.. she has been amazing in all of her work and she needs to be paid her worth 💯
Omg taraj p still had to audition after all those movies 😅 we know she is versatile and purely talented
Kindly refer to a clinical or medical reference together with a legal advisor as post traumatic effects of non physical abuse are very prone to pass through certain phases that are clinical but a human person first response is a normality as a norm visible through examples of ....am ok...i dont to look sick...how do i face a clinical counselor?its not bad...but knowledge of a situation not being sick but getting tools is more of a stage where it will push the mind to get those tools and sometime one will fall in to a shame phase where you may not want anyone to know and would get angry when one comments that shame is not a reason.....?... Kindly accept our ability to relate to these phases
For example, a state where the policy makers are unresponsive is extremely traumatic. One is entitled to law and protection like any other professionals like footballers or nurses. Kindly every  stage in trauma from silent or irresponsibility abuse is  encompass in healing. Thank you for thinking about other actors  like you
Thank you so much for saying and sharing this. I'm a little Indie Filmmaker and thinking of quitting too for same reason on a tiny scale. It's awful that Taraji has to still go through this. Thank you so much Taraji for sharing.
Sounds like any job to be honest 😂
I LOVE TARAJI P HENSON, her craft is sooooo on point and I really hope something is done. This is a lady that I hardly hear complain, someone needs to hear and rally. Even more, she’s speak for a gender and a race not in a bigoted way but …
It’s not your house..get out of it and build your own.💯
I think it's great that she's being honest.  But it's sad to see the negative energy around the time of the release of her new movie.
MONIQUE.... We knew she was right ! Taraji , BABY, YOU KEEP YOUR HEAD UP !!!! KEEP THAT HEAD UP ! WE SEE YOU, WE HEAR YOU ! ❤❤❤❤❤❤💕💕💕💕Boo trust ,we  translate......I agree what he is saying, BUT GUESS WHAT !! WE HAVE BILLS ALSO  ! ....
We're at a sad place in this world when rich people get on camera and complain about not being rich enough this is sad she pulled up to the show in a Rolls-Royce and want us to believe that she's not being properly compensated them crocodile tears ain't fooling nobody
Taraji is doing business the wrong way. The math ain't mathing because that 30% comes off the top. Not uncle Sam.     According to her; she only brought home $100k for the color purple and that $500k got taxed twice! She paid taxes on it initially then her "team" was taxed the second time on the same money. She was supposed to do her payroll then pay on the $350k which would've been $175 to herself.......Or ....come up with as many business expenses as she could and only paid taxes on $100k and pocket $300k + instead. She could've had them display art in the movie then donate it to a museum with a million dollar price tag and pay absolutey nothing to Uncle Sam. That's star power that she's not even using! the college expenses she spoke on from earlier in her career,..what we did was give custody to my daughter's grandmother.      I love the f outta Taraji but she needs to step her game up to another level. She needs to stop chasing money and make it chase her. Walk away from a few deals. Start negotiations @$3million. If they can't afford it then find ppl who can..frfr!
Gabby Union talked about how these actresses have to fake wanting jobs just so the chosen one can get a fair deal. SMH. Everything is broken. We have to do better all around. Julia Roberts doesn’t have to go through this.
So heartbreaking :(
Katt Williams sent me here.
I wish I could talk to her tell her not to stop acting I mean screw the haters and stand up and get your money
It actually makes things worse when the general public trivialize stuff and make it about ONE person. This is NOT about Monique, Tyler Perry or  Oprah. Oprah was one of 18 executive producers. Her and Quincy Jones' financial contribution were pennies compared to the studio connections. . This is about a system. Taraji complained, rightfully so, about being paid nothing for a MEGA blockbuster hit Hidden Talents and a blockbuster TV show Empire , a loooong time ago and she still isn't being paid, by NO ONE. She has one of the best agents and teams out there and still,  she gets a fraction of other actresses.  It's the system! There isn't one single black actress in the top 10 highest paid. Not ONE.    But guess who is..... Gal Gadot and Melissa McCarthy. There are even women where acting isn't even their main career that make more like Lady GAGA and Jennifer Lopez.  Zendeya is the closest thing to making a lot of money, Not Taraji, Olivia or Viola. THE problem is the system.  That is why she is about to quit.
After hearing this someone will tell me Eminem is the greatest rapper ever in a black African culture. God punish you there
It means they are using them for their influence over the culture. Not to let them benefit from their skills.
Why so entitled? These guys in the entertainment industry already get paid way more than their skills are worth in the real world... Actors rely on so many people to even exist. Think about how many people with real knowledge it takes to create a position for an actor to have work, just look at the credits at the end of a movie. Most actors aren't out here building studios, writing scripts or funding projects, they wait until most of the work has been done then read lines and play pretend. They add the least but complain the most... Get over it and find the courage to build something from the ground up.
30% of 5 million. Well maybe budget a little better. I’m sorry, but the way the interview is being portrayed as if she’s getting paid nothing I could see if at the end of the year she’s only made $100,000 and she’s done tons of projects, but if you’re still making a couple million per project, maybe budgetingshould be the thing. If you love this craft stick with it by now, Tarazi should probably have her own production company or have her own movies being made. She’s been around for a long time and I’m pretty sure if she would’ve quit acting you still would have finances.
It's funny really. I've never heard zoe Saldana complain.
Round of a plause for this phenomenonal performance from this amazing actress
She is acting right now...........BRAVO BRAVO BRAVO
Bless you Taraji❤❤❤.  Never seen her cry, so it must be SERIOUS.  She deserves to be treated well. Super talented and gracious.
We are with you Taraji. It would help if celebrities not being paid well could speak up again all of the horrible things the billionaires are doing. They are in their positions bc they step on others.
Invest your money to secure your future
Monique courageously stood up on this point and everyone blew her off. Cut the BS, this aint new or the first time you've heard this.
I literally cannot believe that Taraji - after all she has done - still has to be experiencing this. The USA is one messed up country. I don't care if you come for me, come for me if you want.  Because it is the truth and it us what it is.   And what do they MEAN that African American talent doesn't translate overseas. I am LITERALLY overseas, and I saw Taraji's name show up in my feed and I was like "Ooohhh! Have to watch this interview...I LOVE her!". Which "overseas" are they talking about exactly? Some people going to have some serious things to explain to God on judgment day, and I don't know how He and them are going to make it out.  African Americans: please get your passports and experience - truly experience - other countries. Do it for your mental health and to get a fresh perspective on life. Because the whole world is not like this, and you need to experience what it is to be able to be somewhere and be recognised for the whole entire human being that you are.
You need better management! What about self accountability
She is not that kind of star. She's good, but doesn't really stand out from a lot of the women that cover the same genres. We haven't really see her carry a film well as a lead.
We don't translate overseas???? I've BEEN watching B&W French and German films since I was 13 years old!  Why do they get to translate, but WE don't???? She's exactly right!  They are playin' in her face!
She trying to save face for playing that role bye bih. 😂
Positive side is she’s worth $13 million dollars, but negatively she’s getting underpaid and it’s sad news, but I don’t get the crying. There are people homeless in streets of America who don’t have a roof and very little food, and they still stay strong and upbeat. 😢
The question is … Is she a A- list actress ? NO She doesn’t has a blockbuster film… She deserves a better payment ? Yes, we all do.  But its weird she’s saying she needs to pay people and at the end of the day she barely has money …😅
💔
May I ask why no one is holding Steven Spielberg’s Amblin Productions equally responsible? There are FOUR PRODUCTION COMPANIES that produced this film…. Sooooooooooo why is it that yet again the BLACK woman is the one who is vilified?
I thought it was just South African film industry that was exploiting artists but I see this issue is global.
tara don't n wat "working so hard..""" let her compare with a poor black woman working so hard 24/7 in 3 jobs or the homeless or drug addict
Sirius - Sirius B - Dog Star, hence the "Star" logo. IYKYK.
Ooh i see it now because she refused to sell her soul, her salary is suffering. Amazing I just cant believe it
NO Sir, paying me is giving me my flowers!!!! I feel like even he’s playing in her face too!!! Because what I heard in that statement was you being acknowledged and included should be enough for you to feel appreciated. Boy Bye, tell ya homie to pay the woman what she’s worth!!!
I love me some Taraji but seriously, i'm not sure if the studio execs are responsible for this but she plays the same ghetto girl, i'm-gonna-give-you-a-piece-of-my-mind, neck cranking and finger wagging character.  Even in Benjamin Button it was hard to see her in a role like this because she didn't really transform the way some actresses can.  And I have yet to see her do an accent other than what's she's known for.  Aint she from DC?  She played the same character in Proud Mary that she did in Empire and the Color Purple.  The same high pitched screaming and giving you a piece of my mind character we saw in baby boy.  She's good, but is she worth what she's asking for in comparison to actresses that can absolutely transform in look and in accent and speech?  Maybe she hasn't been "Given" an opportunity to.  Idk.  I wish I can see her play a role that is completely opposite of the personality we know her to be already.  It kinda doesn't feel like acting more than her being herself on the big screen.  No shade but she's been Cookie Lyons this entire Color Purple press tour in real life.    I wish she would create other characters for herself that we haven't seen instead of beggin these white folks and black gatekeepers for a check.  I would like to see her range grow and play a character I can't easily associate with her real life personality.
Hidden figures - biopic of Katherine Johnson who was literally a NASA COMPUTER MATHEMATIC GENIUS! That movie should of got her an OSCAR! (PTAH - GOOGLE PTAH, THEY CAN'T HELP BUT STEAL OUR HISTORY). She deserves to get no less than 40M a movie.
Taraji u need to sell your souls to get in the game of the higestest paid. Hollywood is a trade for souls n exchange of spirits.   Just know that everyone living heavy n flashing in the Hollywood has sold their sold. Look at ciara, nicole swaz...
My Mother told me back in the 80s when Oprah had that talk show.. That Oprah was not What she was cut out to be.  I mention Oprah name and My Mother would Tremble  I see now my mother was right  I haven't went to go see the color purple yet but id I do it will be only to support Taraji and Fantasia. But I wouldn't support  None of All of them Folks she's talking about. Keep your head up Taraji You are A Soldier  Stand Strong Because Giants do Fall! We love You❤
Out of work since 2019 these five years have flown by and I am applying asking for way less it just does not make any sense. (COLLEGE EDUCATED FOR WHAT??)
I love her so much and she deserves more than what they offer I hear her very clear give her what she’s worth do what makes you happy Taraji don’t cry you deserve the world you are such a beautiful woman you’re such a wonderful actor always remember that they would lose a beautiful woman look at it this way their loss but her gain I LOVE YOU TARAJI
No one is talking about the fact that she is the only one NOT nominated for the movie
This is more entertaining than watching Taraji perform.  Bet she's being lowballed to do all these interviews.
But here.the thing.monique been saying this for a long time  and honestly it not just the woman it's also.the men as well that not getting  paid as well to.but.i definitely  been knew this long time ago monique  been said this and honestly  this ain't brand new oprah.dont care she been shady  period ???
This was church right here live on satan king ooops Gayle king live 😂
She’s a millionaire! I can’t buy groceries!
Talent and awards are not the only reasons people go to the movies. She is just not that famous or attractive for the box office. Math are "mathing".
I pray for her. I truly do. See us humans walk this earth confused. Only because the devil has put pressure on the unknown. So because you are scared of your future. You run into things thinking it will secure your future. God never told us to plan anything. Why? Because fate does not work accordance to plan. When God said those who help themselves he did not mean physically. He meant spiritual. If you don't lift yourself up and lay in fathers hands. The devil will continue to pull you apart. You don't have to worship the devil to be pulled apart by the devil. Devil is not just devil. The devil has evil brothers and sisters. Who help him. So imagine running from God's shield. While being attacked by arrows. Yet you are tired of the arrows. You are tired of the pain and blood being shed. But you ran from the shield? Traji and so many of this world. Are running from the shield of Jesus and God. Don't tell me because you go to church. And pray from time to time. You have accept his shield. You need to do more than that. Faith takes a whole lot. Meaning you have no expectations. You don't know what is next. Or mabey you know what but don't know when. You have to play your role. What is the true role of a man and Woman. We crave God and Jesus. We crave blessings. But because faith is gone. Or not there. We starve. Suffering in the hands of the devil. In the mighty name of Jesus. Turn to our lord. Turn to our God. Protection is now! Do not let the devil continue to block your blessings Amen 🙏🏼✝️❤️🫶
Yes Taraji has the audacity the right to speak and voice her concerns as a black leading lady to get paid well for her job. A job that she does with heart body and soul and is amazing in the way she does. I’ve seen a lot of her movies, shows and interviews. And I just watched her movie called. The Best of Enemies and again she is incredibly talented and amazing. A movie that is a true story from the early 70’s. Taraji needs to get paid a hell of a lot more. She  one of the very greatest beautiful black leading ladies of the movie industry. She deserves to be treated with respect. How dare Oprah not pay this women better. Taraji puts her heart into every role big or small that she is given. Taraji is not difficult, she is just 100% right 👍
The one thing about inside of the entertainment industry out here in America (From New York East Coast USA to California West Coast USA) is always  some negative business, especially when it comes down to the money 💵 situation everyone. For real. Yes.   I wish Hollywood would let those celebrities get what they deserve financially after he or she puts in hard working, hustle grit and grind, blood and sweat from material that comes out music, films, shows, TV shows plus more everyone. For real. Yes.
The black race is the worst we don't stand up for each other as long as it doesn't  affect them then they turn a blind eye....Monique came out long ago with these complaint no one stand with her .why didn't she came forward and stand with Monique
Monique was right
When you see your own people do it should hurt that much more. Greed is a sickness. When you hear this from one actor at a time and not as a group makes it hard to believe. Power in nunbers!
Pay that Woman! Forget the fact that the work speaks for itself and it’s the rewarding experience. Like she said. The bills speak and they rent is due and the accolades and praise don’t cover those bills. Pay that Woman her worth! Or the moments will cease to come. We won’t get another Color Purple. We have  to as a people stop allowing folks to play in our faces when we show up and get the job done. Whether it’s some big acting job. In your 9 to 5 job. Whether you in the small business arena. Whatever. When we show up ready to get the job done and the environment and foundation isn’t set for your work you’ve done in preparation for the job then Hell No.
This is so sad about Taraj hope and 🙏 pray she do get what she deserves she is a wonderful actress God Bless her sweet soul sad she up there 😭 crying like that
My heart aches and breaks for this sweet baby girl.  Taraji has put her ALL in every project she's ever played a role in.... LITERALLY,  & to just be given someone's backside to kiss after all the hard work she's put in time after time just to have to grin & bare it to put food on her table and pay her staff is beyond degrading.  I can't blame her,  and I can't blame her for thinking that all her hard work was in vain in the event that she makes the conscious decision to walk away from it all.  We are in 2024, yet our race is STILL facing systematic racism. I can't imagine what people like Hattie McDaniels must be thinking as she looks down  seeing young sistas like this about to throw in the towel because she's basically being FORCED to do so......
6:12 - 6:57 That's the light here! (But yes I understand DEEPLY Taraji's tears! Don't you *_dare_* disappear mami! That's only letting them fully win. And there is SO much good to take from NOW! But staying and fighting for the future is WORTHY! _While_ creating worthy masterpieces and pieces of art!)  Wow, what hills, mountains, and Everests black people have to always face! And then being a woman... it only doubles these challenges.
WOW, umm these actos aren't flipping burgers at Up N Atom burger or making minimum wage. I don't feel sorry them not one single second. These actors WANT to be in Hollywood, they don't HAVE to be there. Try living paycheck to paycheck like most of us are. Hell some people kids are still making syrup sandwiches or fried bologna sandwiches because they HAVE no idea where the next meal is coming from. Try sending your kid to school with the same school clothes they had on last year or 2 years ago when they barely fit. Yeah you might earn far less than Tom Cruise or Brad Pitt or Denzel Washington but hey you are STILL making millions after taxes and after all your agents, managers, hair dressers, and publicists are paid YOU ARE STILL A MILLIONAIRE. Some people out here have 2 or 3 jobs and are still struggling.
I was going to see the movie but now I think I am turned off by it.
God has another calling for her!!!❤
I love Taraji and her acting, but her a ting style isn’t even close to Viola and Octavia or Denzel, etc. so that’s why her pay isn’t on the same rate.
Taraji did a great job in the movie! I was very proud of her! Thank you Taraji for speaking up!…. Being a Broadway actress … when I was a single mom whew after paying just  for babysitting… especially during the tech time (10 hour rehearsal days) when I was an original cast member in The Color Purple on Broadway I was struggling to buy something to wear for opening night… it can be a challenging business… when the “math isn’t mathing”… and to play the “part” on and off stage… I am EXTREMELY grateful for ALL my experiences… that’s why most of the time we grin and bear it… and to most it appears we are living the dream but honey… lol everything has a price…
I'm not going to look at the comments because I came over from another channel regarding BDL (body language) & had this as a link describing it as the interview; Taraji' may quit..etc Well, I do not like Gayle King, so this still doesn't give me any context of why this was brought up, I will try to look for the whole interview, because once again, she, Gayle is O's cheerleader. This also reminds me of her questioning Kobe's past when he and his daughter were killed in an airplane crash, "taken out of context by producers", when the hell it should not have even been mentioned.
What she is saying is universal for the average working person. We are all tired!!!
Black hollywood owes Monique an apology
Taraji deserves whatever she ask for. She has proven herself time and time again and she shows up and shows out EVERYTIME‼️💯
Taraji P. Blessings
😂
She should take up writing
She is not going to quit acting - let us get that out of the way.
BIG, names, need to ,  PAY what a person is worth,   why kick a PERSON if they are trying to climb, WTF, ,   HOW MUCH. (MF),  MONEY DO YOU NEED TO, STEAL FROM OTHER,   ALL NEED TO EAT,
If you want to play minstrel characters you get TREATED like minstrel characters. The very last thing "black" people needed was another Color Purple. Keep that in mind
i appreciate and love black people, black culture and theblack influence in the creative industry globally. but lets talk for a min. trara ji was told she doesnt translate internationally in movies, could it be beacause the majority of the world stilll prefer white people in movies? take out emotions for a sec, is it due to just majority's preference in what they see in movies? In music, black people lead and is prefered by the world, we see black ppl's influence in music globally, but in movies it might not 'translate'. DEVILS ADVOCATE here, yall opinion welcome.
That’s fucked up.  This ain’t women’s sports.  This is acting.  She has some amazing roles in amazing movies.  They definitely should be paid the same.    But the WNBA on the other hand..
I'm a new Taraji fan here. I watched  Proud Mary on Netflix and Hidden Figures on Disney. She was phenomenal.
She’s one of the best actresses left! Orca is a cheap scoundrel!
She is very brave.
And the sad part is that is coming from her own people 😬🫠
Nfn she is kind of right, if you look at her filmography of all the films she’s been in you’d expect her to be getting paid a lot more & have a higher Net Worth… something isn’t right! I know she’s in a better situation than most of us but it still doesn’t negate the fact that she’s been working extremely hard in Hollywood for nearly 25 years & deserves at least $5 Million a movie minimum 💯
WOW pretty good acting Taraji. So quit then!!!! YOU chose to accept that amount of money so deal with it now. JS
Black Americans don't translate overseas? What a big lie.
Fake bond from Oprah
Gail, how did you have the AUDACITY to tell Taraji to stop talking.
I’ve been saying Oprah is white mans black owner for minutes. And yet she proves me right
Never  stop sister  ,that's what they want
SHE NEVER ANSWERED THE QUESTION LMAO
Get out that rvil business Tarji! In reality, it is the devil’s workshop and your soul will never be at peace.  No one is forcing her to stay and why is she bashing Oprah after the fact? Tarji is a veteran actress and it was her choice to take these roles.
People take money from acting and create your own stuff...then you can write your own CHECK...😮 Instead crying and looking for a high paycheck....black people...
Some black actors owe Monique an apology.  She said this 2 or 3 years ago but some people were not on her side
Yeah, but what movie was she in that where it made 100+ million dollars that she was the lead actress in?
Oprah should know better after she struggled to be paid fairly. Taraji with you all the way!!! ❤
Monique said this years ago after being blackballed and labelled difficult.. these girls deserve way better!!
She didn't have to take any of them roles she played don't blame nobody but herself she'd done spend the mulla now she's going after OBLOCK
Taraji you are simply an extraordinary actress. ❤ Keep strong sending you love xxx
I love Taraji & I believe every single word came out of her mouth
Taraji  “NEVER TAKE THE WARPAINT OFF” !!!
Us below average people deal with this 24/7
Getting any kind of role in a movie is like winning the lottery, and there are people who would pay to have the experience of it.
I'm from Fiji and yes Taraji you are  talented,fierce and a phenomenal actress and definitely international. Taraji is the only reason I bother to visit any movie platform to watch her next release.She is so unique and unapologetic and real in her acting .She's remarkable..
0:32 ancestors felt that.
@3:00 Gayle, silly🙃. Not the "okay, carry on."
So I did a search on NET WORTH for several actresses, both black and white! Even though ppl might say it’s not important in the grand scheme of things I can see her point and pain!  The math ain’t  mathin !  Looking at years in the business and projects! They get paid a lot more than the average women but it’s not about the average it’s about Hollywood and TVland… so in comparison to their white counterparts our sisters are definitely being slighted…ijs
she's putting on an act.
Is Taraji considered an A-Lister?  The conversation starts there.  I thought she was an A-Lister but apparently many people don’t think so. I know pay is determined by status.
amusing - she is already rich and lives in a mansion.
Taraji P. Henson doesn't deserve that. These film folks are wrong to the core how they do Actors and Actresses especially colored. Wish Taraji the best 🙏🏽
taraji won’t get work for a minute after this… her crying about her pay when she should’ve been promoting the film (that didn’t even come out until xmas) is a bad look overall. it took away from the film. when you google the film you only see her and her drama. kinda surprised she’s this unaware how she came across…just bad business lol
Is Kanye right about the owners of Hollywood and how racist they truly are?
Hilarious!
But this is nothing new .. we know this ..but its not just Taraji .. its in every job from the cleaner to doctors, nurses, teachers ..
We as BLACK People if We come together and ALL eat from the same table we will ALWAYS get paid less.
Taraji we stand with you your not alone ❤
Sadly movies that are very popular with our people, don't translate well with "other" audicences .. our people don't go to the movies the same...I may be speaking with out knowledge but if we aren't going to the movies and we wait for things like Bootleg or Tubi... How on earth could these amazing and talented actors and actresses get the money they deserve if we aren't go to the theater to support ?
To be fair, she still has an impressive net worth. She is worth 12 million dollars!  She made millions on Empire!
Everyone is getting robbed.  Or your selling your soul. And money isn't worth it.
Mo'Nique warned y'all!! NONE of you backed her up! Underpaid actors is normal in all spectrum of the entertainment industry! This is nothing new!
Hmmm hmmm wow just so you know we feel your struggle , we have to be brave she got 10 million everyone pays uncle sam thats five you pay your people 30 % you got 3.5 million to yourself how many people did that 30% get split between? Dont here them complaining
Crying over 3.5 million life is hard
These cycles of disparity have to be broken.  Unity and a united front is what it takes for correction. Taraji I feel your pain and it's real.  Know that you are so loved, admired and appreciated.   I sincerely hope that the Lord's justice intervene on your behalf and others. You are such an amazingly talented person whose worth is earned and deserved.
I'm confused?  It's like is Taraji saying she didn't get paid enough for The Color Purple?  And the director was saying something like they 'had' to audition?  Still I'm confused?  Is this something Oprah can take care of?  I mean she IS a producer on this movie.  🤨😟🫤
2:25/9:11
The only question is why now? Maybe because she feels encouraged by the cast but just curious with her being in empire and these other films.
U don’t travel overseas 😂 and I watch u from Nigeria 🇳🇬
“ Oprah , she talking crazy over here” Oprah side chick Gayle
Would have to know the pay to make a judgment , sounds like she got loads of staff earning too much of her dime
Hollywood is a business. It's about how many butts they can put in seats. Henson will make more money when she has a string of $100 million movies that she HEADLINED. Maybe she also needs a better agent. Award-winning movies don't equal higher pay if they don't make blockbuster money.
I would feel bad if there job wasn’t literally playing make believe   Unless you are getting paid less then 100k a year  You should probably find another job if that isn’t enough to live
Love You Taraji 🙏🏾❤🫶🏾  Please take a break, leave for a while, do what you have to do to recoup. please! Xoxo
I watch Taraji's movies in India and love her each time. She shouldn't cry, she is blessed with our admiration.
Viola Davis just got hunger games…  As a black community I just think it’s important to see what’s important and what’s the truth. Most of Taraji’s role has not stepped out outside roles that don’t only pertain to the black race.   And now she’s doing the colour purple.   Love the original film, love the remake but she hasn’t stepped out of her original roles which the Hollywood world isn’t going to praise for that in regards to her name being big enough to just be hired for HER.   Baby boy, empire, think like a man , hidden figures…  I’m not trying to say she doesn’t deserve the praise because she does but she clearly doesn’t know how this real game of works.  Viola Davis did it. She can do it.
Soon as she said TAXES 😢😢😢😢
Taraji P. Henson is my new boo!🥰
As a brand Ms Taraji be inspired by siting in that room and figure out how to enterprise. It's not about being a 1 trick pony. Diversify. Art is art. Is not to profited off of for millions however to connect amd bring people together from nations. Figure out your deep passions and run it up. Focus baby.
I can feel her pain😢
50% more like 75%    Four fathers get there's that's sad cold truth thats not fair ... like did all that and result show as if did put all that in     She was ready f up some things and flip building up side down down down have every right to but keep composure see way through it cuz we see the great truth !!! While those been sleepin - math aint mathin  Real gift is inspire for next builds strength like no others broke fear and stage fright something those still haven't... every movie ever star in been so great but heard it in her voice the trembling to get out ready scream it out felt that heard that's not actting at all that was real her that came out  Felt that break down like it aint enough but walk outside and realize more than enough
Taraji girl I got your back I feel your energy. I know your at a place of what do you do? At a crossroads you just tired of the b.s!
She’s gaslighting everybody😂😂😂
This is American Entertainment.  Damn.
After I did the math I realized!!! she still rich af!!! Try get taxes n child support taken out!!! Was she underpaid in this movie? I love this woman but what blockbuster films did she do?
I hear taraji,you shouldn't have to ask,you are sooooooooo good,I love you ❤
ACRIMONY!! 😢
Let her come to Africa she will live large she can do great in local entertainment here…..
Yes these people steal the SOULS…
Speak the truth!!!
We love u Taraji 💐
We put out a video on our channel about Taraji. She knows exactly why she's not being paid what she's worth, but she's forbidden from telling the truth about it. When she's ready to stop playing games with people, perhaps she can be honest.

TARAJI P, THIS IS THE SECOND TIME I'VE SEEN YOU CRYING ON A SHOW, BUT EACH TIME I'M CONNECTED TO THIS PAIN IN THE VOICE OF YOUR HEART, AND I KNOW YOU'RE SO REAL. I DON'T BELIEVE IN CHANCE, YOUR TEARS ARE A SEED FOR A BETTER FUTURE. I LIKED WHEN YOU SAID, YOU WILL NOT LET ANYTHING STEAL YOUR SOUL. BE STRONG, DON’T GIVE UP. I SUPPORT YOU IN MY PRAYERS MY SISTER. LOVE YOU SO MUCH
We see you Taraji from Nigeria. And we love you
I love Taraji so much yes and I hope and pray it changes for her and all black women actresses
Did the actor’s strike address THIS???
boo hoo 😢😢😢😂😂
Some of these comments suggest that the authors don’t have an understanding of how this show biz stuff operates. $5 million is being nearly broke by Hollywood standards. If you know any actors personally, just ask them. $5 million is indeed a lot of money for ordinary Joe and Jane. But not for Hollywood. I’m not a fan of Oprah. Back in the day when her talk show first aired, I actually called the local affiliates and asked them if they were going to continue airing her show. I wasn’t trying to get her show off the air. I just asked a question. They answered me, no. Her early shows were horrible and  always “ talked under folks’ clothes.”  Why didn’t she herself supplement the salaries of the Purple 2023 cast? I would have if I were the producer and had the billions and name recognition that Oprah has. To me, Oprah has and continues to operate in bad faith. Didn’t even send a note of sympathy when Michael died and later went to Miss Katherine’s house to exploit her for ratings. Even in that interview, Oprah didn’t express condolences, if my memory is correct. Yes, I did look at her show that day because I have followed the Jacksons all through their careers.
The truth of the matter is this, Oprah don't owe anyone anything. Along with that, Taraji could have said "no" just as Monique did (YOU GO GIRL). Nobody forced any of them to take the roles or pay.
I cannot support OPRAH, OBAMA, TYLER PERRY & P. DIDDY in anything they produce or work on. Greetings 🇯🇲 TARAJI ps keep your head up high. No interest in Color Purple.
OPRAH will favor FANTASIA because she cannot read & write.  TARAJI is a strong & talented woman.  Greetings 🇯🇲
TEAM TARAJI
So you basically working for fame?! SMH…Not to mention how they expect for you to sell your soul for the role’s is very much sad😢 that’s cray!
what I can see and not see is ..mental breakdown coming/greed millionaires work one year and make millions and the average people's struggle to make 20k stop crying do more with yal rich famous money invest your self better give back to society and charity then Uncle Sam will see less. You spend 100k for one vehicle. don’t live beyond your means.
Some Black Actors do translate overseas(Denzel/Tyler Perry)if you can prove that to the studios then you have a legitimate complaint.
Whaaa a rich famous black person crying about how they don’t make enough money?! I’ve heard it all now I guess 🙄
BabyGirl we got you. Not Taraji! No ma'am ! We will not stand for the tearing down of this woman of worth   Rest Taraji, get yourself all together.  Listen to your heart.  You deserve nothing but the best in life. Let no man or woman Queen or Titan lessen you because you mean everything to your family, righteous  Black people, your fans, your day 1s and come alongs in the industry Dust your red bottoms and purge all this mess they roped you into over this past year.  I am not supporting Black Business that destroy Black entrepreneurs and workers. I will not pay to see TCP...I support black stars and their industry but knowing that you will get about 1.5 out if 10 mil which equates to about 10% I refuse to support the MACHINE You are a Star. STAY strong minded, strong willed and if it is at all possible stay out of thier wicked ways ..   No, not Taraji!  They have gone too far.  What can we do
To those who say that the cast won’t get paid if Purple 2023 is boycotted, I think you need to educate me. I thought that they got a salary up front. You definitely need to educate me on how residuals work.  I thought that residuals were paid every time a work is played on cable or wherever the film is streamed. I need to do more homework. Yes, we can boycott without harming the actors’  bank!
Shes typecast by TP, Viola don't play that ish. Plus People out here living on less, don't live above your means.
🎻🎻🎻
Boo hoo. There's a cost of doing business in every business. Crying ABOUT 6-7 FIGURE  35% Profit vs most small business struggling to make 7% TOTAL. The problem is They wanna live The lifestyle Of those making more than them. Welcome to capitalism. How many struggling actors wish they had her problems 😅
It’s hard to feel sorry for a millionaire. Quit griping.
Good riddance to mini Okrah.
Cry more 😂
I've loved Taraji since Baby Boy, I really believe she deserves so much more than she is getting.
Don’t stop acting. Taraji. You’re too talented to give it up.
How do you continue to alam the hand that fed you.  So suck of her trying to tuin this project.
I absolutely love this sister (Henson) as an actress!
Looking back at this old clip, I see love and courage of one telling their truth... I went to see The Color Purple 💜 on The 25 and it was Awesome 💯. I didn't know Whoopi Goldberg was going to in it and a lot of other actors... Thank you Mr director for picking the actresses and actors because, this is classic on it's own.  To God and you all 🙏🏾🙏🙏🏽☺️
This is amazing  Thank you 🙏🏽
So everything Monique said was true. She isn’t paid to do a press tour… THAT’S NOT FAIR AT ALL. Oprah is a black woman, who produced the movie… she has money but she is SELFISH AND THIS HAS BEEN SAID MULTIPLE TIMES
GAYLE KING S SITTING THERE PRETENDING SHE DON'T KNOW  IT'S OPRAH IS THE REAL MONEY  HUNGRY  DEMON BEHIND THIS
In my opinion people been knowing Ms Taraji as Evette till this day plus a lot of people would say this to Ms Taraji but truthfully she's a good black female actress till this day plus the black men she worked with is TG aka Tyrese Gibson,SD aka Snoop Dogg,OG pt 1 aka Omar Gooding, TH aka Terrence Howard, KH aka Kevin Hart ❤️❤️, Terrence J, RM aka Romany Malco,Mr Ali & ME aka Michael Ealy as well plus did a good job working with these guys in movies as well & plus to Ms Taraji truthfully my parents used to watch Empire as well on Fox 🦊🦊 as well.
We appreciate you even though you are not paid what you are worth.
I knew it!!!  That’s all I have to say.
WTF do they keep remaking this movie over and over again? There's gotta be better scripts.. seriously.
If you don’t think they are paying you what you’re worth. Why take the money then cry?
Sports figures go through this every year. Uncle Sam come for them too. They have others to pay too. Ain’t nobody shedding a tear for u. If u don’t like it quit
All I heard the director say is “we may not pay you what you’re worth but at least your work will inspire people throughout the nation” which is proving her point. Taraji KNOWS she can inspire people, hell. Look at all of years of experience she has. She should be paid based off of her VALUE. Giving her flowers does not pay the bills!
I give you,  your 👑  🏆 ❤ 303A.
You do not have to accept what any producer is offering you. If a negotiation takes place, you STILL do not have to accept the negotiated offer if you feel that you are worth more. I would also recommend downsizing the team. I also believe that when black women are told that they don't "translate" overseas, this just means that they do not produce enough money overseas for producers to put energy into it. I am sure that there are several people overseas that love black women in movies, but everything boils down to economics. Can you make these producers money? And I want to quickly add, the producer in this video just gaslighted her like CRAZY. I did not hear him say "well we paid you nice!" He just went into the spill about love and relationships and how that is what really matters...
Isn’t that how Monique felt???
Absolutely reason they get you in a distribution deals They'll pay you up-front knowing the Revenue of Ya Credibility is gonna make 10x
Sometimes when you love what you do sometimes it won’t love you back. Don’t worry Taraji I believe THE MOST HIGH IS PREPARING YOU FOR SOMETHING greater and by exposing the very sinister side of this industry and those wicked Gatekeepers. And as you can see more and more people are starting too expose these wicked people. Because sometimes they look like us but aren’t for us. They are always plotting against those who speak out but You are a true Queen Taraji, so continue walking in your divine power.
00.6 was the code Gail gave her to “Stop Talking” anybody else picked up on that?🤔
I love taraji and oprah Winfrey" But oprah Winfrey have to be fair and pay these ladies right" Because God don't like  wrong" 👀 And may God bless for Peace & Love.🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
I feel this so much 💔
I’m glad this popped up on my feed and that I was able to watch the entire interview. All I saw before were clips of Taraji vs. Oprah, half of which were AI-generated and all of them were trying to tear us down by pitting us against each other (or in this case Taraji  against Oprah, Tyler Perry & Lee Daniels).
Love Taraji and Monique and everyone speaking out about this! ❤
Oprah y’all need to be dam shame, 150.000 wow and Tarji why would you accept that ? Opera God sits high boo😊you should know the struggles. Think about that tie you were over seas how you as a black billionaire woman was disrespected
This explains why she seemed so down on the Jennifer Hudson show with her cast on the “color purple” …. Something is off about Oprah I feel like she’s really downing her own black women…. Oprah Winfrey is a narcissist
Quit!
She is such a baby.
This isn't a "rich people problems" issue. This is a Global issue for black women-especially in the states. You know your worth, you know your talent, you know your skill. Yet your counterparts and those who haven't put in nearly as much work and experience as you, walk through the door brand new. I definitely can relate.
Most people in this country are tired. They not as fortunate as you are. This conversation is for you and your agent. She’s having a mental health issue.
Damn this is sad, people didn't want to believe what Monique was telling us, everyone thought she was going crazy. Am backing Taraji and Monique all the way!❤❤  Where does the money go!?🤔🤷🏾‍♀️ Plus hearing about these producers and they're dirty ways needs to end.
Come to south Africa sister we love you over here
But, the gentleman missed the point. Pay Disparity & Fairness.  Yes, Taraji wants to inspire. BUT, she also wants to be paid her worth; not doing so, is to devalue her.  That's what I got from it.
It is important to know that the job we hold may not be able to pay us what we worth...since it is about what the job worths.. As a result,  persons would need to choose jobs that pay them their worth.  For example, if one thinks that he or she worths the salary of a political figure, it will then be useless to work as a nurse (though its also hard work). You would  only be underpaid for your worth in that job!. We must see it as our ideal jobs were created for us...rather than we were created for our jobs. With such mindset, we wont settle for anything less than what we are worth. An employer  and an employee pay is never the same. Though the employee may seemingly work harder.
They could easily work together put money up buy out networks and solve this problem tonight if they wanted to.
I blame oprah and tyler perry
Its telling underrated
This may SHOCK most folk, neither Oprah nor Taraji is wrong, they’re both correct!  Oprah, and Tyler Perry from what I’ve seen has made it their goal to either re-employ black actors that was once relevant but forgotten, and employ new talent by giving them a shot. When putting these men and women back to work, I believe that was their only goal but to give them the pay they deserved was not on the agenda. Yesterday you had no job, no calls coming in, so they provided that. They’re seeing you do it without complaining for the OTHERS so they feel you’ll be grateful enough to have work.   Now the problem comes when you get a talented, seasoned actress such as Taraji that has proven herself by working in Hollywood for years being underpaid and without clashing with THOSE producers thinking this is all there is, or not wanting to rock the boat.   She’s possibly thinking I’ll finally work for my own and they know what I’m worth and they’ll be different cause they know the struggles we face. She had higher expectations out of them. She’s offended that they’re not looking at this as an all for one one for all type of situation. It’s like the scene in DJANGO when the slaves see Jamie Fox and want to fight him damn near for talking down to them the way the white folks did. It’s expected for the slave owner to mistreat you but it’s not tolerated or you’re offended for your own to do it.  All this is to say both feelings are justified and I hope that the industry gets better because I clearly remember Julia Robert’s mentioning she makes 20 million a role and that was about 20 years ago so our black actors deserve better especially the ones who’s proven themselves just as worthy as their white counterparts.
The problem is  uncle sam is a illegal  crime  scam , taxes are  illegal
Invest your money…
yeahhh right -you got 18mil for empire alone,buhuuuuu.cry me a river,go and change agency if you are unsatisfied!!!also you have your tax returns and exemptions so it's not true that you are left with ONLY 3.6mil in the end!!!!!!i'm so sorry for your "hard work". what a crap...
I have a hard time feeling sympathy for millionaires :/ oh no this black millionaire isn't making as much money other white millionaire, dang. I wouldn't be crying if i was a millionaire bro. I'd be annoyed for sure but crying and questioning my career over this is crazy, especially when so many people WISH they could make it as an actor. This is all so tone deaf.
I get what her issue is as far as fairness in pay, but the entertainment industry determines your value based upon your ability to draw attention to the projects you’re working and that value is placed by the powers that be and that doesn’t always translate to seniority….
Nice interview with movie actress Taraji Henson talking about The Color Purple remake movie. I understand why Taraji was mad about being underpaid money for her movies. Taraji should be making as much money as white movie actresses. Taraji is better than a lot of white movie actresses who make more money than Taraji. I'm a lightskin black man who's been unemployed for 6 years. I can't keep a job because of my white bosses complaining. Every job i get is always a low money salary. That's why i've never had a car and nice apartment. I get money and food stamps from social services. I'm staying at a homeless shelter in Alexandria, Virginia until government housing gets me a apartment. Black people always are underpaid at jobs. That's why black people get stuck in the ghetto. Black people can never move to white neighborhoods because of being underpaid at jobs. My advice to Taraji for her to get the money she wants is Taraji needs to fire people she has working for her. Taraji got too many employees on her payroll. That's why Taraji isn't getting a lot of money for movies. Taraji should think about getting a house that's not expensive. Taraji needs to move outta her expensive house so she can save money. Taraji Henson, Grace Gealey, Paula Patton, Caryn Ward are my favorite black movie actresses.
IMHO - she made a mistake taking Hustle and Flow. She has been typecasted. Take the $2M she got from COlor Purple and find a new career.
We aint NEVER gonna get a Baby Boy Sequel starring Yvette  I'm in her corner.
I support my sisters ❤.. Hell yes 📣 BLACK WOMEN DO CONNECT OVERSEA!!!! Look at all these other nations stealing "EVERYTHING" from Black people, EVERYTHING!!!! We live rent-free in these people heads.. Misappropriation on the highest level.. Im totally convinced, these other nations want our souls 😡
Perhaps she needs better representation. Its all about the representation. Oprah does not represent her. Who is she paying to negotiate for her? .
Do not stop acting because  of her,her stop is coming😂
All I want to know is did this production do right by her and if not why didn't they get BLACK Hollywood behind the entire production.
This is really bothering her and I don't blame her. Every interview she has been preaching the same thing. She is a great actress and I wonder what she will do if she stops.
And they keep live in a place and keep voting for the people who want to take more and more and more hahahhaha.
I hate this. Taraji is such a beautiful person, and I HATE the unfair and EVIL industry.  It’s NOT RIGHT.  God bless her, truly.  So evil.  Her soul is pure, and SHE DESERVES TO BE PAID FOR HER INCREDIBLE TALENT.
So you're crying about making "only" ten million? I'm sorry but I have a hard time feeling any sympathy for rich people problems. 🙄  Yes, uncle Sam will take half.... but ONLY if you don't have any expenses or write offs. Expenses like the staff you mentioned that requires 30% of your 5 million.  That is a write off hun.
Sick of them with all that whining and carrying. Life is about choices.... And she CHOSE THIS! Looking and living glamorously and still ain't happy. Everything she is saying is what all people go through in a certain tax bracket 😒. Happiness is an inside job.
What he said was good and all. But I'm with Taraji. Show me the money.
🤣🤣🤣🤣 this a joke right?
I understand how she feels but she lived a life and been places most will not see. And investing is very key because they don’t wanna pay certain groups the same way
Why @king say audacity, when you know what she is going through. She is not like dear, she is not the best friend of who you know. Why some of our sisters keep on tearing us down!!!
But she is right they don't promote those movies here in Europe there are some black movies like Black Pantha or Hip Hop movies like B.I.G, Tupac, NWA because we have many Hip Hop fans here, but I didn't see The color Purple be promoted here I don't even think its on theaters here
You get, what you bring in.  And she is a horrible actress.
THIS IS OUR PROBLEM RIGHT HERE!  ACCOUNTABILITY READ IT IN FULL: why 30 years and washed up. No body checking for her.. did she fight for Monique when Monique was yelling the same thing.. so tell her suck it up.. her stats suck  Make.your own. Movie.. distribute it and make your money....  stop begging for stuff what makes you think ppl that hate you will pay you more  again do better oh and a black women paid her.. on her last movie means women don't support women stop the victim mentality get together with others and make your own instead of crying
This queens making Millions and Millions and getting  cents
Don’t buy a million dollar home manage your money better
Ohohoh... I get the female pay vs male, the black VS white, still... Her description, her words... How should a woman that works in the grocery store feel like, managing the food your going to feed your kids, or the nurse in any hospital... Can they think about quitting??
I’m wondering if there was any enjoyment making this movie for her as the financial aspect seems so raw and triggering for her. It will have happened so long ago before they made the movie, had post production and possibly she’s worked on something else since. Yet every interview I’ve seen clips of so far focuses on how unhappy she is. She must not have enjoyed the whole process if she is still so triggered. Or is something else going on with her. I understand discussing low pay is important but during what should be the promotion of the movie seems counterproductive. I’d hate the movie to not get the audience it should because people think they’re making some sort of solidarity with her. If the movie is popular that raises the worth of negotiations for all the cast in their next projects, surely.
It took Monique to make everyone else feel “okay” to come forward. But everyone knows that the majority of the world’s population doesn’t translate overseas - miraculously. Because we supposed to do the work silly not get paid. It translates so little that the world’s majority no longer watch American shows; because we are simply just not there.
Hi Taraji: they want u to join the baphomet "purple sisterhood", don't u get it ??
that is why JESUS CHRIST is the only way
And your still doing better than 95 percent of the country.....but get yo bread girl if you can.
& had the nerve to blackball Monique. smh, this is sad…
Monique was right about Everything about Oprah Winfrey I believe her back then I don't know why. But I did because if you know anything about Monique she ain't lying about nothing like that😢
Why do you think decades ago our people left this country to receive fairness.
Taraji is a great and graceful actress. Every role she has played she has excelled so to be told SHE DOES NOT TRANSLATE OVERSEAS?? What is that. Am in South Africa and i love her. Taraji you translate to all the "overseas" that you are told you dont translate in. Hollywood does not deserve your tears. Do you and be the best at what you do and be happy. We love you and appreciate your work.
Where’s the full interview?
Yooo so she telling this to Oprah’s best friend tho. Stop the 🧢! Great ratings tactic.😂 they playing in y’all face rn.🤦🏽‍♀️
kanye been saying it
That industry is not for you sis! It’s evil and corrupt! Rejection is Gods protection baby! Can’t play in the devil’s playground and not expect him to be the bully on the block!  Flip side: I would love to see the movie I know it’s inspirational & I love the directors response! ❤
dude don't know how to turn it off 😂
Do they not know their salary in advance?
I will not be seeing the Color Purple!!!
Did everybody forget about Janet Jackson's 2 record breaking Record contracts...she did something years ago but years ago...not sure what Em trying to say...did that Point in history just turn around to this.
James 5:4 Behold, the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth: and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth. Acts 7:7 And the nation to whom they shall be in bondage to [400 YEARS] will I judge, said GOD: and after that shall they come forth, and serve Me in this place.
Who would not feel cheated when Billionaires want to keep you broke or have you work for nothing. They have been where you are. Listen Taraji, what would Cookie Lyons say or do??? Girl channel your inner "Cookie"... I am here for it!
She one of the best actresses! Better than Jolie!
She is a great actress...that is the Truth  !
It’s aweful how black women are treated.  Taraji has range from Benjamin Button, Hidden Figures, Acrimony, the best of enemies, empire, etc.  she is eclectic and multifaceted so it’s disappointing to know she isn’t  paid for her brand and talent.
Women have been dealing with this same issue for years shes not the first person or the only woman in Hollywood Haley Berry said the same thing years ago
Monique’s career was sabotaged. Everyone knows this
The pay was better decades ago than it is now and there was far more opportunity for actors in scripted content and commercial ads.  This lady is telling the audience that she’s going broke trying to stay in the industry. What doth Oprah say about the poor compensation policies?
That wall is UNDEFEATED
There are select few in Hollywood that make the crazy money... it's a rough business.  Ups and downs and for many you get to a point where you just wonder where your slice of the pie is.
The fact that, they weren't initially considered for their respective roles, is downright disrespectful. Due to the film's exorbiant budget, the studio originally  did not want to take a chance on Taraji, Danielle and Fantasia. The harsh reality is that show business is more about the "business" and less about the "show" which means that studios are only concerned with making big profits on the projects they invest hundreds of millions of dollars into. In other words, they care less about the art and the actors whose blood, sweat and tears translate into what we see on screen.
This press tour is the end of Tarji. She emotionally can’t do it anymore
Everyone who's ever felt not valued for their employer feels her. I feel you Taraji
This is why there has been a boycott in the filming industry
Don't you ever sell your soul to Satan Taraji like other Actors.  One day Yeshua (Jesus) will bless you with a script that will give you the largest pay salary than any other movies you have done❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉. We love you Taraji
You notice how he tried to shut doqm Tataji's voice. Pay attention.....pariiachy is devil. #BlackWomenRiseUP!!!
And I'm tired of all these celebrities complaining and crying about how much is left for them. They still make much more than their worth celebrities are spoiled and many if not most do not deserve/earn what they are paid try living on minimum wage or even double minimum wage and see how hard life is. You don't help society you don't produce anything you just entertain so if you don't like how much you earn get out of the business you don't belong there and the public who is responsible for your salary don't need you.
Can’t help to feel that Media is trying to use this as a distraction from an inspiring Black women movie. The pay is true but it seems they are trying to play it over the new movie that came out. That should be getting more attraction. Let’s uplifthem first, and recognize the problem.
I thank her for speaking not her truth but THE TRUTH!
She told the truth I am black women   I feel the pain
I love you Taraji - elevating your voice and your experiences as a sister in an industry like this; has profound impact. Gracias, thank you I love ya Shug !!!!!!
With the money that these actors & actresses have accumulated, they really can go indie if they want to but i guess a lot of them arent willing to put in the work & would much rather deal with a major production company.
She was excellent in TCP. I really loved her character. A good actor is a good actor, no matter skin color or gender.
Adding a comment to show support. Love what Taraji said! And love how the director doubled down with a powerful message. I felt that  interviewer (Gayle) was ready to transition (subtlety) to another topic by what she said @3:12 but saw the director 's body language @3:17 and invited him to continue with a few words.😶 I might be wrong and be reading too much into it but that's my impression.
They want you to give up my sister, stay strong because we all are apart of this universe no less than the trees or the stars and we have the right to be here. All we need is UNITY among us.
This not about money. Her soul knows that this industry is devilish. Pay attention.
Is that Gayle doing the interview? Oprahs best friend, who will have HER BACK??
I work in the Medical field, and it's the same!!!!!
I felt all this!!!!!
Sounds like she not investing in her self and if she is she needs to invest more
Why take the job and then cry about, it’s not like she is living paycheck to paycheck like most of us.
F*** that lets Talk about uncle Sam why the F he gets %50 and why Uncle Sam didn't get me nothin fo Christmas! ijs 😂 that's what unclea suppose to do
I guess that is why they are actors!! Give her the Oscar for this.
Sounds like she had bad representation….
The big O is NOT LOOKING GOOD AT ALL
Taraji get the right team, agent, manager and lawyer to work with you.
The Budget for Color Purple was $100m, so why was Taraji underpaid. Taraji fire your agent. He is a sell-out. Jesus will see you through. Amen, my sister. Love you, sis.
Why was Will Smith paid $40m out of a budget of $50m ( in King Richard)? It's all about your agent.
Taraji, my beloved sister. Fire your agent. Your agent is selling out. Your agent is meant to fight for you, flaunt your accolades and use it to close deals on your behalf. Will Smith was paid $40m from a budget of $50m, because he has a great agent fighting for him.
😢
where was this energy when monique been saying this
I cried with her as she shed those tears as I am an African American Woman who has been in corporate America for 30 years being significantly underpaid in comparison to my white counterparts. During this time of extreme inflation and a single mother to a special needs child, this topic is beyond personal and deeply painful. When does it end or will it ever? Nevertheless, fight we must😢
There are disparities in EVERY industry. Another industry would would bring another disparity.  Besides, after 30% of the $5 million goes to her team, $3.5 million is left. What other industry would she work in to earn that?
1:06 Then why do you keep voting for lawmakers who peddle in the "they need to pay their fair share" politics?
What did Taraji mean by, "..they tell me we don't translate overseas"?
We who work 9-5 need more money 💴
Taraji got a 'We don't care if you're a black woman, you're STILL BLACK ' reminder.
In the acting world you have to understand that you may have the opportunity to be blessed with a few hit movies, it may not mean you are a true talent…. Women have a short window being a success in Hollywood because age and time catches everyone.
Where Monique at??! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
I LOVE YOU TARAJI. You are seen and heard.
Taraji it's happening to us all here. I have been passed over for promotions more than I can count. Same goes for the money. I've had companies tell me they don't have anymore money for bonuses for my behind but will hire someone new with NO experience and then have my ass train them!!! You want to talk about a slap in the face. Now I understand why so many start their own gigs. Who wants to continue to be treated like trash and right in your face too then wonder why folks quit. Hang in there gurl but yea it's not only you.
I wonder does Gayle have anything to do with Taraji and Oprah situation
The math aint mathin? Bingo theres the reason you dont get paid
BOOO FUCKIN HOOO
I dont know who this is, maybe thats why you dont get paid
Gayle: I heard on the street you had the the AUDACITY to talk about quitting acting...  Me: GAYLE SHUT 🤬 UP‼️   I can only imagine what being a part of HOLLYWEIRD is like and a pray many can get out with their souls intact 🙏🏾
Please Taraji don't quit we need ur essences and ur magic please don't take it away God got u
Same Kanye Frustration
Im always gonna see TPH as Yvette from baby boy.
Boo whoo its many people wish they can be in your position so miss with the bs crying
- Just, where is she going to work if she quit acting? One needs to go to school to become a nurse.
Awe...............the maffs aint maffin
I hate seeing her like that 2:00 😫😭💔
Poor baby I hope she can get by on her millions😂😂😂
🙏🏽🙏🏽❤️😇😇
All artists, musicians, writers, actors etc..will soon be replaced by AI. So many are now members of the new Useless Class. Just get used to being worthless.
Ok but how will she survived?
And judging by the reviews, i wont be seeing TCP. Just from the OG movie alone, it made black men look bad so why would i go see the remake?
Vote democrat over and over
If she's not happy with what she's offered, then she needs a better agent.   Her net worth is $12 million dollars,  I think she's doing ok.
Y’all go support this movie and let’s support taraji for her work! At some point they must of made it right for her to continue with the color purple so let’s celebrate her! Let’s celebrate Fantasia and let’s celebrate this movie! They all deserve this Oscar! Come on black ppl VOTE! They go trying to get you to not celebrate and support this BLACK film! Don’t fall for the okie doke! Taraji ain’t talking about “us” she talking about “them”! This her first film with all black production and directors so our kind has not been the problem
So sad for Taraji feeling and going through this, yeah it’s sad it’s a continued struggle ….but wtf the rest of us lowly, working folks been going through on a damn daily and yearly basis, without nearly as much as she makes…the same ish…yessss, we’ve been “just tired” for the longest too…just keep thriving and surviving like the rest of us🫤
Quit Hollywood go to Canada
Try working for a living.
Why she wait till she did the color purple to speak on her pay, she could have said that when she was sitting at home before the ask her to do the color purple
Monique and Taraji have one person in common and that’s Oprah. Oprah pretends to be supportive but she blackballed Monique. Oprah is a producer on Color Purple and could easily pay Taraji what she’s worth but she doesn’t.
She was soooooooo good in Empire .
Awwwh y'all out here poor like the rest of us but you're famous. Crazy.
So you've only made a FEW million for 3 months of work..poor baby.
Be Grateful For What You Receive !!!
This is what separates men from women. We know how to maneuver money better than women do. The majority of men dont have an impulsive bug in us to just buy something because it looks good. We'll see something & say "yeah thats nice, i might come back next week for it", whereas when a woman sees something nice, she's gotta have it now. Im not saying what TPH is saying isnt true about not getting paid fairly but she needs to learn to manage her money a lot better.
"Taraji do not quit,trust in the Lord"  ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Watch your money, make smart investments,We all know we under paid as blacks..Learn how to survive with what you have..Clearly a cry of going broke..just honest..
Taraji AINT saying nothing MONIQUE AINT SAID.....YEARS AGO.
Poor, poor thing. Only worth 12-Million USD. Got $175,000 PER EPISODE for Empire. Why she's practically starving. I ain't see The Color Purple or anything else she does 'til she get some HUMILITY - we out here po as can be in the low lands
I can see the tiredness and pain in her it’s so sad 😢
No one supported Monique when she said the same thing!!
Acrimony (the movie) must have been personification of the industry.
Mo was ripped apart
She is one of the best in the industry. The work and stories translates. I hate that people get cheated. The industry is so hard.
Looks like somebody needs to go to a few diddy parties
It’s funny to me, because Monique was saying this very thing, and she snubbed a part from her. Then, where was she at when they were blackballing Monique? She did not care to have her back, so it’s funny to me to see everybody rally around her. When Monique was the first one talking about this, and actually took a hit and got blacklisted. Open your eyes
Sounds like Hollywood needs a DEI officer.
Taraji P. Henderson is Beautiful ❤
Is it the industry’s fault that Uncle Sam wants 50% ? Uncle Sam gets every working person not just black actresses. So really she should start the crying with the percentage that’s being paid to “the team”. Uncle Sam is not exclusive to black women.
So funny...very laughable.  Complaining and cheesin....sad.
She already backtracking
The color purple ant worth ur soul
Well, I have checked Taraji's social media accounts: 21 MILLION Instagram fans, 5 MILLION Twitter fans and 11 MILLION Facebook fans. That's 37 MILLION fans... but's let's round it back to 35 MILLION. Now, if she leveraged that incredible social media group and pitched a movie project to them through crowdfunding that she would star in and produce with lots of other great Black actresses and actors, she could raise millions.   If she asked her fans to donate a minimum of $10 towards the production in exchange for a digital copy of the film, she could raise $350,000,000!!! That's a bigger budget than Fast and Furious 10 or Avengers: Infinity War or Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End or Justice League or Star Wars: The Last Jedi or Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness or Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny or Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One!
stop living beyond your means and come back down to earth it's okay to go to walmart and travel on the greyhound sometimes like we do!!
Babygirl I'm srg U r 1 of da greatest actress in my lifetime. U can play any role. Angela Bassett & Viola Davis leading ladies totally underpaid. Wat a pity. I am so proud u stood up & u deserve da millions. I pray better days r coming.
You're telling me Taraji (who defends jussie smollett) claims that the entertainment industry who supported and paraded around BLM for years is not paying a Black actress well?   Is this a joke?
She's a great actress and actors should be paid on the draw they bring. Big names = big money. But I also don't have too much sympathy for anyone who gets to create art for a living. Most of us wish we could have a creative outlet as a career. You want to cry? Try being the average retail or food service worker in the US. The only vacation you get is when you get fired or call in sick without pay. So I feel for her but not a lot.
Seems like higher ups are work with all of us no matter if your working on stage , 9to5 of labor  20-40$ hour and it’s just not add up and looki at as a complainer, difficult or lazy wen knowing your work worth …
But why did Taraji bother to take the job when she knew Oprah was paying her cheaply why bother
Oprah invested in real estate ( beach front property)   I  own r homes and it will prove helpful when  I retire.   I  wish all actresses and athletes would receive financial planning for a life of steady cash flow.   I am not rich .   I am comfortable.    It seems like  the majority of us don't think about long term  income flow . That big pay day  only comes to a small percentage or us.     We have got to talk about  solutions to these money   issues.     The Black community is hemorrhaging
And she probably votes democrat… wonder if that will change
I ain't going to lie I was holding back tears😢
When she works that 9-5 she will be back.
I don't have a lot to say but I will say this: "I support whatever it is that you endeavor on, because character speaks volumes about you."
You signed up for it!! Life ain’t fair but you can choose your battles period!
The Color Purple platform is not where this topic should have been discussed.  It's really important that we are tactful and choose our audience carefully to ensure our concerns are clearly understood.
What’s crying about going to do? Become a producer/writer/director. So many women have had this problem come up with a game plan. Look at Reece Witherspoon a whole ass billionaire. Black women read books.
WFT?!?!  How in the H*** can this amazing actor NOT be paid her worth?!  How in the h***?  How in the H*** can Oprah Winfrey, the wealthiest black woman in the world, NOT pay this woman her worth?!  How in the H*** can Quincy Jones, a legend in the music and black entertainment space, NOT pay this woman her worth?!  How in the F can her own peers not see her value, prop her up, give her the respect she deserves and NOT pay her ALONG with the OTHER black actors in this production?  WFT?    AND, let me go on for a minute: How can Gayle King, a black female journalist, not agree and echo these sentiments?  NOW, we can add that she is a friend of the production teams.  I feel that this conversation should have stayed on topic with, and amongst, the females and not by the MALE Director.  No disrespect to the director or his gender or race.  This is about a topic that a certain section of the entertainment industry can relate to.    I feel this same away about abortion:  men should not have an opinion when discussing who's right it is to choose.  If you don't have the reproductive parts, you don't get a seat at the table to discuss it.
What they are doing now is giving the roles to the Africans in the United Kingdom. To disable us in America
Taraji I love you sis ❤ A regular 40,000 a yr sista. It's hard. But we got each other sis. Love you
I may not support the movie because I don't mess with that woman but TPH I would definitely buy your products even more I love them at Walmart but they need to keep the stock up. 😊♍❤️
Why no one ever calls the white ppl, with power out, by their names? They'll just say the industry and specifically name black ppl.
Whenever you’re working for somebody they are in control. You can always say no and it’s on to the next actor, because somebody is going to do it for short money. The only way to solve this problem is by making your own movies and controlling your own content. Too many black actors in Hollywood pool your money and start your own production company your own movie studio and distribute your own movies then you can be in control of what you make. Until that happens this isn’t going to change
This broke my heart
Taraji deserves ALL her coins
Should be getting 30M like Dwayne?? Or 100M like Tom Cruise ???
Take courage and beat the storm. You are a strong black woman. ❤
Everyone i know watched Empire ONLY BECAUSE OF COOKIE (Tarahji character) & the music
Tyler Perry please represent these sisters❤🙏🏾
Taraji is "ACTING" helloooo people what Taraji was trying to do is broke up Fantasia Marriage in the name of movie color purple...only PURPLE i know is RAIN...
I think they should first ask themselves if they bring in the same revenue as the men they are competing against.
Please, she should be happy she’s even getting featured. She’s a Tier 2 actress at best. I saw her complain that she didn’t get paid like Brad Pitt. Brad freaking Pitt. Get real.
(They have to be brave and we have to support)
In a related issue that also effects Taraji, Matt Damon was saying how compensation in Hollywood has changed with the advent of streaming. Back in the "old days", a movie would get released, then a few months later it would get released on CD/DVD. He said it was like the movie was being released all over again once those royalty checks started coming in. In today's market, actors don't get that secondary bump they used to get from CD/DVD sales.
Monique is right about Oprah. She’s a wolf in sheep’s clothing.  Especially after what she’s doing in Hawaii
Amen this Black Girl Rock that the white media is trying to play with our people
Taraji needs to temper herself....she needs a counselor she can Express herself to. Venting on tv and online will get you blackballed.  Stay calm dear and don't share so much.
The best of enemies  ,T you were so awesome!! The Bible says, dont  get  Weary in well doing ❤  keep up the great work  while you are figure  it out. So you can continue helping others.. you got it girl with the Lords help!! Know your business ❤ 🙏
Did she have a contract? She must have known how much she would get paid. If it wasn't enough for her shouldn't accept the role.
Do you really have to have all of the people's
Monique said the same until Netflix cut that check now she's quiet as a mouse...
Sounds like us average 9-5 workers. Working hard all day for years for 🥜 peanuts
Meanwhile jlo gets paid $20 mil per movie
Black people need to make their own Hollywood
I Love Tarji ❤❤❤❤❤
I'm sorry but the truth of the matter is that when you don't sell, you don't get paid. Taraji IS NOT a draw. We are talking about investors looking to make returns on their investment and there are really only a few typs of projects that give you a reliable return - it's not a black/white thing, it's a green thing. You can't just make films that you feel like making, you have to make what is likely to sell.
My advice to Taraji, to whom I love, it's time to start producing own movies and promote them overseas. We will never get our "Just-Do" here in the USA. What's keeping actors and actresses from producing their own movies, having their own studios, networks, etc. What's keeping people of color here in a country that hates us? IF We (people of color)are of more value in other countries, why are we still living in the USA? Why are we still allowing our children to be poisoned by this type of hatred? Why are we still begging for fair and equal treatment from this country when people in other countries see our value. UNTIL people of color decide that ENOUGH is ENOUGH and decide to leave this country for good, the hatred will continue for more generations to come.
I can understand the frustration and sadness that Taraji has but I also understand the frustrated hamburger flipper that barely makes minimum wage and the single mom working 2 jobs to put a roof over her family's head...I look around me and see the desperation in everyone regardless of race, color or gender...life isn't fair for none of us and that will never change...the elites will see to that....I'll close with never give up and stand your ground...be a warrior.. regardless of the outcome ..never show defeat and above all else put your trust in the Lord..
From what I know and I may be wrong but if Taraji felt like this the whole time how come she didn’t stand behind Monique when she was being butchered by the industry and the wicked public opinion. They all need to stop watching each other go through the same things and unite one another to ensure a better outcome!
You make them all of that money but you get the leftovers
let’s be clear! Monique was blackballed for saying this same thing because she refused to do the press tour without being paid. Seeing Taraji be this emotional makes me wonder if they’re not getting paid for this press tour. Fantasia made a post about Oprah sending her private jet to get her to continue the press tour in NY because she was stuck in California and i’m like y’all can’t afford a plane ticket !? 😅 cause trust and believe their white counterparts all expenses are paid whenever they show up for press if not getting paid to be there as well. .
Pls don't cut off ur nose to spite ur face!!❤  Things will change for you!!
Dealing with that damn Cardi b ,  you know Nicki call the shots
Im tired for you baby! YOU have been HER for quite a while. WE FKN LOVE YOU. If you leave, thats what THEY deserve, NOT us, and NOT you. We will go with you tho, cause you been her!
She is not quitting acting. Come on now. I know she’s frustrated but it’s designed to be against most sisters in Hollywood but each movie, tv series and residual income she has should have her straight for life
Facts. Stand up. Tell your truth and be an advocate. I have so much respect for her!!!
Pay them what they Worth HOLLYWERIDO
She's not a box office draw🤷‍♂️
Monique was crucified for speaking on this  now people get it ‼️
360 deals have never stopped.... They will #always get all your money... Stop #signing those blood contacts with satan... Its all A #TRAP!!!!
When you sign devil deals you get devil treatment....
When you've had enough, this is what happens! You finally speak 🙌 👏
Oprah Winfrey, as SURE as there’s a GOD in Heaven……..your TIME WILL come! This is sooooo unfair! A black woman fighting instead of standing up for other black women. A black woman tossing scraps at other blacks like they’re animals instead of giving them the opportunity to RISE the way she rose and it’s not like they’re looking a handout! They worked HARD for their bread! PAY them FAIRLY!!!!!
I HAVE ONE WORD no ONE PERSON: MONIQUE😐
That director in the yellow... He seems to have sold his soul to the industry a long time ago seeing how he was reacting to the entire conversation. He seems like he wanted her to shut up and was more scared of Oprah than acknowledging Taraji's feelings.
Start scaling back like some other celebs. Buy mini houses, do your own make up etc. Turn down some jobs. Use your money for comfort😢 pay off some things off. Stop spreading yourself thin, if thats the case. Much love to you sis. A lot of us are struggling out here as well❤
Taraji is Oscar level Talented.  For her to say what she's saying makes me think that Why isn't she receiving Meryl Streep money? Taraji is worthy of every dime!! Blew my mind to hear her  speak on this after 20 years of Stellar Excellent work. Crazy man!!!
😂😂😂 But the dollar is an illusion, what are you crying for?
Wow! Normal people go through this every day I feel her 10.00 hour 12.00 hour Uncle Sam give us 15.00 during covid so yeah we been going through!
It sucks, but that's how we all feel every day in every industry . She might as well stay acting cause it sucks when Uncle Sam takes precentages of $15 an hour.
Love you Taraji ❤
Damn so woeking qoth Oprah breaks you? I thought this would change their lives😢
There's no pay inequality Taraji P Henson ranks #574 on the worldwide aggregate box office list Monique ranks #8,777 So stop it Welcome to Equality 🤣🤣🤣
Let me assure you Taraji, you're all over the world with everything that you do. No one should ever lie to you that you don't translate overseas.  I've known you for as many years as the American Audience yet I'm African..  Get what you're worth..  Demand for what you're worth..
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Never give up , always stand out , experience is Your Best quality !
You Black girl Magic is so Popular from all your roles , We love Yvette , On Baby Boy , Come on keep up the Excellent work, until your paid , for what you deserve !
We would be lost without a Taraji years off set , Hell naw ? We need you just like you need your Fans , dont let them stop your Business club, you deserve more ! Angela Bassett still relevant without an Oscar ?
I'm glad she is speaking out. Times have changed and all the skeletons of these people like Oprah, Tyler Perry, etc are coming out people see through them. If Monique came out today, she would never have been blackballed. I'm glad she's getting her flowers too. Take the establishment down.
We know she cant quit her Expertise ? I understand their is taxes , negotiable salaries !   She should be top Notch , plus have to Keep her Own mental health intact ! We love Cookie Lyons !
There's a lot of messed up business in Hollywood
I have been so moved by her words.  All these industries are shady.  Racism is ReAl
Girl tell your best friend to get out your ear. You got a good thing going and you need to count your blessings before you won't be able to find a job. Come on man, ya'll built this country and did not get a penny for it. You think your ancestors complained about it. They made a door by doing this and became successful and that's why you had the opportunity to work with the most powerful woman in the world to bless us with this movie. You gonna get yours if you don't mess it up. Make us and Oprah proud. She gave you a chance. I'm praying for you. Believe!
Ok first keep your head up sister. Next we need to stop asking for someone to do for us what we can do for ourselves. Look we keep hearing the same old things. Open a distribution company write & products your own movies. Theirs enough black writers actors & black people with money to back your project.
Then quit. People pay you a portion of the money you make for them. Its not a charity.
Taraji  is one of my favorite  actresses  as well as Samuel  Jackson  , who  puts out so many movies a year! At the end of the we as black folks are still.inderclass because  they control the industry!  Look how far we've come with characters in film!! Also one of the biggest blockbusters  films  that little  white kids loved was thrown  under the bush just because  lest known  the director was attempted  to be arrested  (Black Panther !) I'm glad you are sneaking  out but remember when Op and Bill Cosby  was trying to purchase  CBS? The reason  was " it would be a cold day in he'll before  they allow black people to on a national candidate station!  It's called serpression if you allow them them to when!! Heck they are trying to put a definition  to Badu 's songs and calling  it Woke! Ensued of braking  down the lyrics or watch  the video! Red yellow black or white, we are precious  in Jesus' sight! Not man!Just keep on keeping hold on to the world as it spins!! And don't let the spin get you down!❤
Oprah over talks too much like shutup and let them answer one question at a time
I’m in the film industry as well, and I can tell you that she’s not Angela Bassitt. I know I’m not on Denzel or Will Smith’s level yet. Everyone isn’t going to get 20 million for a film. And we should be thankful for what we got
I'm confused...this is the same chick that was on a TV show remodeling her step mother's home. Exactly how much money does she want. If you live within your means....things workout. I'm not falling for the tears. You live in a big beautiful home....DOWNSIZE then. These celebrities are a mess.
Hollywood has never been fair to black actors. Get out and live a normal life. Not worth the lies and headaches.
the bottom line is:  taxation is theft
I can understand but there are people in this world who get paid way less and we have to keep working and pushing because most of us have to work hard to be able to have extra or to put anything to the side . She makes more the many of us and I am not saying in their industry they need to make more but be thankful and grateful because she could be out of work pray on the situation work together and build on what you can sometimes you go through things so you can be removed from it GOD is amazing and we all have to remember and know that don’t let these worldly people and things take away from his blessings
I totally agree with you and we love you and we will always love you no matter what you do but we want you to have and keep the respect for yourself and do not let nobody I mean nobody play you nobody
The industry do females wrong this is not right totally disrespectful little pay and hard work and hard sacrifices being away from your family oh no this is not acceptable
This s*** just made me mad 50% there's no way and then 30% to you have nothing oh no baby I would have quit call me what u want you are not about to pimp me oh no this is totally wrong
This is why Tyler perry got his own Hollywood
I love Taraji❤
For all the younger folk that only get some of the stories off social media really need to get the real stories..... for yourself and fully understand it and make it make sense to you. She's wasn't just crying about not getting paid.... there's so much more to this story. LISTEN! Period.
Is not translating overseas is BS because I ain’t never been to another country that didn’t LOOVVVEEE us
TLC said the same thing. Why do are own people do  this to are people living in racist America?
This is sad that this going on in 2023. Taraji is one of the best female actresses in the world! She needs her pay to reflect her work!
She may need to change careers for  her own sanity.  Perhaps, She could reduce her team.  I still don’t think she’s going to find a 9-5 paying her what she  makes.
Just quit, If you feel you're being used, Don't continue to be
Blitz Bazawule's next project should be Schaumburg's Sweet Reminisce!
Tarajis networth as of 2023 is 25 MILLION dollars;  Vs a TEACHERs salary of 40,000 a year? The math ain’t mathin lol give me a break!!!!
My only problem with this interview is that you agree to the amount before you take the role. So, I don't understand this.  You've the power to negotiate what you want to be paid before taking the role. You have the choice to walk away and don't have to take a role.  If you are not getting paid well.  Negotiate what you if deserve..
IT'S ABOUT TIME SOMEONE EXPOSED  HOLLYWOOD!!!
This is sad, the director glossed over the whole point. He said nothing about the lowballing!
That's just them same Damn People trying to keep us down, but we know we are so much better than that!!!  WE ARE AWESOME!!! WE LOVE ❤
They are gaslighting you baby. You are translating overseas. I live in the netherlands and i saw almost every movie you are in. We are starving for our black sisters on screen. And they are saying this to y'all so you will give up and starve us from seeing our reflectings back on screen. This is a spiritual warfare please dont give up or give in should i say. I know you guys (and we) are attacked. But dont believe them. You translate real well over sees. We love you❤
injustice to one of us is Injustice to all of us and we are standing on code, policies must include black America.
LOve her but who cares.
That what I was saying about Oprah and knowing that royalties should be on the table ice cube
They should have stood up with Monique no one cares until it's them
The Jews are raping their pockets! point blank we need our own
IDC!! 😅 Who really does?? Lol
That’s insane n 😢 that all your life u work your ass off n at the end u don’t see the fruit of your hard work
Thats right taraj sister these Rodents dont appreciate the greats. They love pimping us out of OUR SOUL that can glow invent etc and take it all like we aint nothing or did nothing. Please save our youth behind you from these trapped  ILLUSIONS thats appearing to be what its not. Love ya girl. ❤
Oprah should pay them, she has the capability
Oh my gosh taraji 😢
What people in Hollywood don’t give a darn!! We have to boycott all their movies!!!!
Ok well stop
I understand what the director is saying, he had a vision in mind on whom he wanted in his movie but whomever is paying for its production wanted to hire big names for the parts
Taraji !!!!!! Home girl please don't give up acting !!!!!! You are the very best !!!!!!! And we love seeing you on the screen !!!! Love you girlfriend!!!!!!!
Love you Taraji
SAME thing Prince was saying 😢😢😢😢 EXACT same thing
You're one of the few that's not giving up sex for richness. Keep doing what you've been doing. Great actor
Yes quit no need to act. YOUR LIFE IS REAL. SEEK JESUS. THAT'S WHAT WE NEED"the people"need JESUS!
But she stayed Quiet when MONIQUE was talking the math ain't mathing CHIIIIIIIIII✌🏾❤️🙏🏾
No money?  Taraji P Henson's net worth is supposedly $20 million dollars.  Gayle King's is $72 million.  Taraji can stop working right now and live the rest of her life in the sort of luxury I can barely imagine.  What a joke!
Bless you Taraji, loving and praying for you and with you.💯❤👏🙏.
I completely understand exactly what these awesome people are discussing about struggles in payment equality.  This is true in all industries.  It’s not just limited to Black Women.  I have been struggling for payment equality in the Financial Services Industry for over 30 years.
😂😂😂😂😂
U always have a choice not to do them...if feel it's wrong.. someone else will be glad for the breakthrough..
I have always heard that people have had a lot of low budget movies.thats been always..they not willing to put a lot of money into certain movies.. it's nothing personal...people don't have to agree to do them..if they feel it's wrong.u always have to not do them..
I'm seeing a lot of people who are not listening to what she is saying she is not saying she is not appreciative of what she has but like everything else this is a job and although she might be paid better than most people there are people who she has to pay it doesn't matter how much you make it is still paycheck to paycheck every day for most people
She can quit it’s fine. She has a built in personal brand, instead of relying on the Hollywood machine she can do a podcast and make hella money independently. Then she can fund her own films if she want. She’s a great actress. Gotta go around the industry
This shit got me HOT!!! THEY DESERVE TO BE PAID JUST AS MUCH AS ANY MAN!!!
This was an immensely needed conversation‼️👏🏽👏🏽
Uncle Sam is making everybody slaves in the future we all gone be working for food
50%
Were always the victim. I sometimes relate and please dont misunderstand. Im all about black liberation a child of marcus garvey taught generation. And this pity whoah is me. Just leave!!! Use your stardom where your appreciated. Simple.
Get mad at Uncle Sam
My prayer goes out too u  Taraji u deserve  too get pay for your acting u are a good actor : rise 🙏 up God bless u stay strong: 🙏 real talk
🙏🙏🙏🙏 prayers
Hold your head up sister you beautiful intelligent an all of the above people with the most money like Oprah be very jealous hearted your young an beautiful 😍 Oprah just jealous of hun hold your head up 💕 love
To see this as a black woman is very connecting Hmm and the fact that we are treated unfairly because for our hard work and integrity and intelligence and  sacrifices is literally burning my heart that these talented woman are hurting
And I should care why? Because she’s a millionaire? 🙄🙄🙄
Monique we're sorry 😞
It say a lot whn a famous actress having money issues just as the lady that work at the school… 😢
The audacity???!! Obviously her and Oprah been talking prior to the interview.
Much respect to every Black actor & Black actress.  Much respect to Taraji, Viola & Monique for speaking the truth.  Oprah is getting on my nerves.  I don’t know why people treats her like a god.  Oprah was upset at Fantasia for reaching out to Whoopi about the Celie role.  It would’ve been beneficial for Fantasia but Oprah wants to control everything and everybody.  That’s part of the reason Oprah did not appear on The View because her and Whoopi are still beefing with each other.  Oprah, Tyler & Lee Daniels are the Black gatekeepers in Hollywood.  They need to apologize to Monique for speaking about this issue.  I am a firm believer that you should know your worth and be compensated fairly too.  Caucasian actors & actresses get more compensation without fail and that’s not fair.  The entertainment industry is rough for minorities!  Keep speaking the truth!
Jesus I so get it! Teachers feel the SAME exact WAY!!!! Got money for EVERYTHING except a pay raise!
Ive never seen a millionaire cry for not making enough money. I guess i just checked that box. Everyone in the comment section makes me even sicker than this ungrateful woman
12 million net worth. Pathetic
You can pick and choose all you want, keep your faith and bond just pay em what their worth.
As true as Taraji's bold statement may be,  she chose the wrong time to present it to the world.  I pray that the light of the film overshadows the dark comment.
Now that's acting,cry for nous reason .deserv an oscar
She doesn’t pull the numbers on Netflix, and sell out Cinema seats. She a great actor “Yes”. But even Denzel is doing these action movies because they “make more profit”. It’s just business, would u pay 10 million to recieve 1 million profit, cos of an award winning actress?
She makes more then most of us and she is crying about her dream job 🤬
Who’s conducting the interview?
❤❤❤❤❤❤
The hard work and dedication you invest in your channel are truly commendable
She is crying about not getting paid enough for her dream job 🤬
😢😢😢😢😢 Ohh
Didn't even know she had it like that.😳😯😲😲😲
Good to know. Didn't even know all that. But then again, I'm not in the industry.
She's got a VOICE so she could CERTAINLY be successful at THAT. She has a lot in her.
Why don’t she use her own name and skills to open her own production company!! Become a director, producer, writer or Somthing TFff
Listen, blk ppl it's time to move on . We ve done before we can do it again. Love you TARAJI!!
Taraji p Henson, I just want to let you know that I'm praying for you this morning at my kitchen TABLE. RIGHT NOW YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE WASTING YOUR TIME BUT YOU'RE NOT. GOD IS ABOUT TO PUT YOU IN A POSITION WHERE NO MAN CAN TAKE IT AWAY OR KNOCK YOU DOWN. IT HURT ME SO BAD TO SEE 😢 CRY 😢.. WE LOVE YOU PLEASE STAY STRONG... AND YOU SAID QUOTE THE INDUSTRY WILL TAKE YOUR SOUL IF YOU LET THEM 💔 SO VERY MUCH TRUE.   JUST DON'T LET THEM 🙏🏽
As much as I love her acting career, I do not blame her. You have to step aside to self reflect on your career growth and value. If it's not adding up, then adjustments should be made. whether if that's resigning or staying.
Yes, poor thing. A Hollywood star who wants more and more. Go then to work 9 to 5, 6 days a week for 4dollars per hour and then you can cry.
Can you imagine if black people were permitted to freely excel and thrive to the fullest extent of their abilities? Can't have that...they would surpass the powers that be. They might change things and shift the power and wealth. Can't have that. Can't allow black to rise, or anyone for that matter. The power and wealth must stay where it is.
The fact Taraji had to auction was crazy 😢😮
Taraji net worth is 12 million now imagine how many movies she been in TV shows and etc she definitely should be worth aleast 100 million but 12 mill is a disgrace for her acting skills
We all go through this and try doing this to get paid minimum wage. Working over 180 hours every two weeks and the government and medical expenses are taking our money constantly. They talk about how black culture is going to start Segregation in the year 2024
Off subject: Imagine working 120 hrs in two weeks at a nursing home, as a nursing aide and only getting paid 769$ take home, when your rent and bills are  1000$. Facts movies are nothing but entertainment, but 1st responders,  nursing assistants and teachers can't even make ends meet. I'm sorry but I can't and will not feel sorry for a millionaire,l that's  not getting fair pay. If you live in America and you wanna live comfortable it requires hard work and dedication. There are millions of people truly suffering in the world from true poverty . teachers, 1st responders and  medical staff need the pay raises.
I am Black female Veteran.  People would be surprised at the open disrespect from VA.
Well said! Monique was right but the delivery affected how we received her message.
At 53 years old this has to be a terrible feeling
Taraji what you have given to the world is priceless  your gift has been overlooked  by the industry yet your light shines so bright  and that my dear is awesome I send well wishes and prosperous energy  your way GOD IS WITHIN YOU 🙏😇❤️
Oprah made money. Up from slavery to enslaving others.  Sorry directors you just minimize her emotions and her story. She can’t eat your exemplary
I want to give you a hug Taraji. Hang in there.
Yes, you do translate overseas! They KNOW how valuable you are. They deliberately keep shortchanging you. YOU are amazing, Taraji. Keep on keeping on.
I'm so glad Taraji spoke out. It reminds me of when Lisa left eye lopes from TLC  broke down the math for the music industry (search the clip on YouTube). I was born in the 90's, so I grew up watching Taraji. She is one of our elite actresses. It's BS that black movies don't translate overseas. Do all the black people on earth live in America? The U.K, Australia the carribbean,  Mother Africa, come on, these people are playing in our faces. Check the nunbers, "black" productions do well everywhere on this planet.  Monique spoke on this nonsense years ago, but she no one took her seriously because they didn’t like her delivery. So then Gabrielle Union comes a long, one of Princess' of black cinema. She speaks on it. They like her delivery, but... oh wait - isn't her former legend nba husband worth over $200 mil?! Ok, so whose listening to her talk about money?... it's sad.   Taraji, do what makes your spirit have peace. If acting doesn't compensate you, do not allow them to make you a slave.  I'm so sorry Taraji, but know, WE appreciate you.
Makes sense to me, everybody along the way says how can we use this person. This really needs to change.
There isn't enough money for everyone in Hollywood. She always does supporting roles and she does well in those roles. There are plenty of actors who are decent actors but they have to make money another way. So sincerely i don't have any sympathy for actors they are asking about making millions.
You are not gonna make more money doing anything else 😢
I Love you Taraji I feel your pain😢!
Black actresses do translate overseas and for all movie goers worldwide! Whoopi Goldberg, Angela Bassett, Halle Berry are all super beloved here in Europe. I'm Dutch/German and there movies still get played here on television all the time. There classics! Taraji is amazing! I hope she continues her acting.
From actors, teachers, service workers, ALL OF US IN THE US! We all need better paying wages hell.
So sad. Something has to change. Overall.
I like her acknowledging her team . There is a whole team behind a brand
GOD just needs to start over. Because it’s not going to get better in any kind of way. We shouldn’t even be having this discussion. We are American living in America, the land of the free, yet we are broke and tired. Make it make sense.
It's always the people that have it all are the ones to tell you that you are so valued,and deserves it all while not pushing to help you get to a position for those in authority to understand why is it you must respect my work,my talent,and what weight I come with..TPH has been literally telling us for many years about the pay disparity in Hollyweird for people of color and this is absolutely shameful...This woman has been at it for over two plus decades,and to this day her worth isn't being valued,horrendous!!!!
Can I come on your show.....
It’s not necessary about her being a black woman. It’s more about how money is distributed. If I heard correctly, her peoples get paid of the gross not the net not to mention the IRS portion.    The IRS is the damn mafia….
Then get into another type of work and quit your crying.  I didn't thank I was getting paid enough so I changed my line of work.
Where were these people, when Monique , said the same thing and was trying to get what was due to her and the rest of the blk industry.None of them came out to support her, when she was being , ridiculed, talked down to,  blk balled and lied upon. This was the time all blk celebs should have stepped out and supported her and themselves and the blk folks coming up, by coming ,together to build their own film industry. But  they remained silent and left Monique out there high and dry.  So I don’t feel sorry for any of them .  Mark 8:36 KJV bible  36 For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?
She obviously has not sold her soul in Hollywood
😢 Wow, Taraji is a very strong, incredible woman. 👏🏼 She's been through a lot in life. Especially with raising her son as a single mother to pursue her career.   Even though i've heard of her speaking on this before. I had never seen her break down like this.   However, I am glad she did to expose the truth. 😢 I hope 🙏🏼 and pray justice is served for talented black celebrities in the industry. Especially the ones who deserve it.
I look forward to Steve Vai, a 40 year working musician and multi Grammy winner, finally being paid as much as Beyoncé.   Deserve has nothing to do with it.
I understand. I relate. Applied for jobs 10 years over here and not one application approved after I graduated college. Nobody took a chance with me. Only in America I think black women are Overlooked
I hope she opens her own field in the industry, it’s not easy but it’s possible and I’m pretty sure a lot of poc in the Industry feel her. She can do it she’s so well known and such fantastic actor.
I remember when Monique spoke about this issue regarding Netflix not wanting to pay her what she was asking for. She asked for Netflix to be boycotted and everyone laughed at her. Now look at what is happening to Taraji.
I cannot trust the tears of an actress
You know, this could be why Vivica A Fox took a step back from acting and pivoted to her wig line. She likely made more money from her wig lines than her acting roles.    I stood by Mo’Nique when she called on her community to boycott Netflix.  I now support Taraji standing on her truth regarding pay inequity that black women in the acting industry experience.   Side note: if Taraji does decide to step back from acting, a wig line from her would really be lit.
Women need to come together and produce their own movies
Taraji Henderson Should Be Getting Zll Her Money!! That's Iwe To Her!!  I Believe It's Racist In Hollywood, Ca Vs White's.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ Thank you
It is sad you are being used by these greedy people.
Give it a rest you drama queen
You, know what to do...,Now do it!!!
Taraji, don't u dare give up!!!
I don’t get paid enough to go through this nonsense.
When Mo spoke out she was immediately labeled as "hard to work with", "a loud mouth", always complaining!  And that was by our own people!  When you are a pioneer you have to be tough skinned but we are all human and 20+ years in the game is tough but that is what America has done to OUR generational wealth!  I love your work Taraji!!  Any movie you are in I immediately watch it!  Love Viola and Angela Bassett!  Y'all are #1 in my eyesight!
Stop buying stuff you don't need or can afford. That's your problem !
Ms. Taraji P. Henson, you have always been that woman for US. You look,  talk,  express, represent, exalt, relate, and beautify US! Thank you,  queen!
Never believe the images of a person you see on tv.        When it comes to Oprah, Whoopi, Taraji and the rest they aren't what you see.        Oprah is or has done what Phonywood does pay black people less and reap the bottom-line.        Taraji should've walked away, one should never accept low pay and talk about it later that's bad business.         As far a Whoopi and Oprah go they can try and mend that phoniness but the truth always shows itself, they're only fooling themselves.            Oprah is a billionaire, do you really think she's worried about anyone but herself you better think again.           She has more money than the entire Color Purple cast, so she should've made sure they were paid well just because.          When you give people more than they believe they're worth that says a great deal about your character.          Oprah's character is now being questioned.
And everybody told aunty Mo she was crazy. She was right all along!
Glory Go Taraji
she thinking too small. if u wanna help the younger upcoming ones, become a producer and pay them as your employee that big sum you think they worth: (I suspect u may realise the risk in producing movies). It is a business with possibility of serious losses.
It is worth mentioning that the Equal Rights Amendment has not passed in the United States. The pay disparity for women is LEGAL. This issue could absolutely be a fix that EVERY woman (and MEN TOO) could press for NOW. It is outrageous that this was introduced as a bill in 1923 and still we cannot as a people bring ourselves to ratify into our laws that women are equal across the board.
Ima say this again... THIS GAME IS NOT OURS!! WE MYST START OUR OWN NATION AND LANGUAGE... YOU CANT ASK SOMEONE WHO BEAT YOU IN WAR TO EVER GIVE YOU ANYTHING IF THEY RULE OVER YOU. A BULLY DOESNT STOP BULLYING YOU UNTIL YOU WHOOP HIS ASS. WHEN ARE WE GONNA STOP ASKING FOR EQUALITY AND CLAIMING OUR GREATNESS!! THE ENTIRE WORLD IS INSPIRED BY US. STOP ASKING AND MARCHING... CREATE AN FIGHT FOR YOUR OWN NATION OF ELITE BEINGS!!!
They never worry about Korean movies translating overseas. Nor do you hear people afraid of Chinese produced movies doing well in Western markets. Why is there always a question when it comes to how black people are perceived?
I was wondering, if i should release this prayerto the Universe. But after watching Taraji P's interview I realize the world need this prayer too.  So I released.  Thank you Taraji for highlighting the in equality in pay amongst our people.  We are legally enslaved by a system that live off of our blood swet and tears.  This is the only way they know how to live. This is what brings them joy. To tear us down and watch us tear eachother down. Sending you love during the holidays Taraji!  I enjoyed working with you every time. You are a powerful, kind soul.   https://youtu.be/uNaGw4mRHvM?si=lPM0cpq10CkBGcGs
Everyone watched Hidden Figures, empire etc.
🙏🏿💚
It is bullshit. Everyone watched steve harvey films. I am all the way here in asia. Always lived in asia. We watch family feud and black films on netflix and streaming services like everypne else does. I had plenty of fools in singapore posting black squares after the George Floyd incident but then refusing to acknowledge the racism on their own shores
You don't live or work a 9 to 5 life and have enough money to live great. Better than the working world. You get most fame and popularity with every movie or show. People lose their homes or can't afford to get clothes or shoes for their kids but she complains about not getting 10 million to her self for acting/pretending. Working so hard LMFAO. Be happy and drop the team.
This has been happening for almost a century....HOllywood has been racist...still is....We been saying Oprah, Gayle is sell outs....But the biggest picture is. that Hollywood is still racist..
No told yell to go on strike.  Never satisfied.  Always want more  and more. While the little ones really work for pennies never complain.  The problem is you all living above your means. 😢
The real gift is getting paid your worth and more period. The government basically keeps they hand in your pocket, ass and neck.
Monique!!!!! Thank you Monique, because I believed you when you said the first time!   Everyone wanted to blackball her, but now look!!!! The world is listening and looking! 😢😢😢 😡 😡 😡
You Don't Have To Be A Actor To Be Tied of Working Too Hard To Make Someone else Rich .
You do relate to African audiences.
I used to respect Oprah so much, but when I saw how she treated TarajahP on that day they all got together at the Emire State Building in NY, I saw what a snobby witch she was to Taraji I wanted to just hug and protect Taraji she hurt her so much. Taraji you are a spectacular actress, don’t give up, we support you!!
Sacred work 😢amen to that.
Came to watch this interview from TikTok. Such a disgrace and this issue permeates through many aspects of the black experience. Tragic and respect to her bravery.
DID MONIQUE LIEEEEEEE, SHE SAID THESE EXACT SAME WORDS‼️🎯
Work for the Lord in acting. The lord blesses. It’s deeper than what I just wrote.
Love love love taraji!! she is one of my idols!! I hope things turn around🩷
1st Monique, now Taraji, are we letting our own people down is the question??? Because we most definitely have enough powerful people in place to make a difference!
Welcome to the real world! Everyone is working really hard today and is still broke. We are all tired!! Who did you vote for? Talk to the man in the white house about his Bidenomics!!!
Tara was amazing in Person Of Interest.  No one wanted to see her go from that show.  Amazing actress.   Actresses have been paid significantly less than men doing the same job for years, both in entertainment and in other jobs.  Even worse for people of different ethnicities .  Getting better but very slow going.
1.5 mil take home is not enough money to go to the movies. I think my math isn’t mathing 😮
This brought tears to my eyes.  I know for a fact that Taraji works her butt off and she’s been in the game way too long to be undervalued.  Black people work just as hard or even harder than their white counterparts but just because of their race, which they have NO control of…..their pay is waaaaay less.  It’s not fair!
well, lets see how she likes workin at 8 dollars a hour..i am sooo sick of the poor me attitude
Wow
Dame draconians
Its says were slaves😢
This woman is super super talented. She is worth a lot to entertainment. Pay these black women their worth in this industry.
Tariji and Monique we love you. I am so glad that you spoke it.
That's fuckin deeep😮
God bless you! It touched my spirit when you said " preparing for the next generation" God downloaded in my spirit you are walking in your divine purpose. God knows your heart. He is building your vision. Your desires & financial blessing is on the way... I love you much! Keep pressing towards the mark of the high calling of God. ...❤❤🎉
Oprah had the power to get Warner Brothers to pay her more but she obviously didn't give a shit....lol!!
She's such a talented actress. How can black American actors not relate overseas. I'm from Australia and have absolutely loved watching black movies and listening to black music and I'm white
She has paid her dues ,over and over again.......👍 Tell them again dear one ,tell them again.......👍 Same in a work place (( the more you make ,the more they take)) ,uncle Sam nobody friend ❗ You work yourself to death (( to put food on tables('s) ,shoes on feet👀 , clothes on other's👀 backs not just yours ,the monthly over head every month to keep you afloat,and it's every month.Then the ones who never take their hands out your pocket ,and blinge off your muscles and never say a kind word as you struggle for them and you take left overs as they continue to bling and never see you are wind beneath their wings "with Father Gods help" you hang on. ❤Taraggie I see you ,have always seen you and knew you had a story yourself waiting to be told .You are real to me ,human ,and a darn great actor " you are worth millions in gold" as an actor and a person.May you raise to the highest paid female actor soon and very soon.You as so many people have f color has always ,always rose to the occasion in your field and bent over backwards for your child's better future,I hope he grow to know he had one great mom ,who wonted more for herself and her child........❤
I  agree 😢
You're crying 10 years late. Mo'nique stood ALONE against Oprah and Tyler Perry and Lee Daniels. Mo'nique stood up ALONE against Netflix. Where were the black voices then?
I believe that Taraji is very courageous for speaking up about fair pay for all black women - not just in show business, but in the work industry. I hope that we get our proper recognition and pay. All the best.
I understand everything she says and it should never be about black or white who gets the most money if your talented your talented and should get paid as good as anyone else that's talented
Taraji is super dope so I feel for her 💯
Kountry Wayne really found the cheat code
I'm crying right now for her for them yes even for me life is so so hard when you trying to make it life make you know you can't give up you have to fight like hell 😢 but I know know that my father has my back he got me and you too so don't give up
Don't spend so much and you should be fine.
Who surprised? Majority of  black woman in  EVERY field get treated. This is and has been the norm. If ANY body wonder why we snap off quick, and "look like this🙄" this is why. Tired of fighting on the bottom just to make it to the bottom. We work hard asf
I'm blown away at the government taking FIFTY-FIVE ZERO(!!!!) of her paycheck!!! THAT'S why she can't get ahead!! That's a LOT of money to just TAKE from someone who works HARD for her money.  And what's being done with that money???
I can't be concerned about the pay celebrities get or don't get what about us regular folks ,uncle taking from our pockets as well ,Point is we're All in the same boat.
she is such a force and beautiful as well. I never knew it was this hard - I always thought she was top tier.
Good riddance. Most people won't even know you're gone.
An election a year is just around the corner. Time to cue up all the -isms, political divisions, and get the media propaganda machine rolling at full throttle!
Never heard of her.Join the WNBA.
Ok. I hear u, I do, it is unfair. But... U make more than enough to survive on what you do. People be working two jobs and still end up on the street.  It's an injustice that the pay gap is what it is. But... Maybe we should be the ones crying when we literally can't even eat and ur complaining about having to pay taxes of 5 million, pay your "team" 3 million and only being left with a measly and lousy 2 million. Barely enough to keep breathing, right?
U can maybe open an acting school and educate them.
Yes I understand Sister praying for all Yawl.
Thank you Thank you for keeping it real for what is truly going on!!!!!!  People need to know the price and the sacrifice you pay to do what you do!!  Why do black women have to feel like a discount 🤔
I definitely feel her pain🙏🏽we have had  to deal with everything and people want to act these things don’t exist. We are not all lying we are always being taken advantage of . Things need to change.:
It would've been nice had some of you stood with Monique when she expressed the same thing. In fact, it's some of the same players behind the scenes that Monique spoke on. Does Monique and Taraji deserve more money? Of course, they do. Really, parts should be offered to them, they shouldn't have to audition for every role.
Man's Suit is Pissing me Off!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I feel her pain you do get so fed up of feeling so unappreciated and she deserves her flowers 💐 because she is a hard worker and I don’t blame her because you get tired of not getting what you worked hard for and it does gets tiring I love you Taraji you are beautiful and good at what you do as a actress 🥰 and never allow the devil to tear you down God got you
We NEED to STOP going to watch slave movies that ISN'T a  representation of the truth. When we support these movies, the production is making all the movies. I'm not going to support another movie that doesn't show US in a position light
This is EXACYLY why we as Black People can NOT rise above this kind of treatment...We keep going against OUR own Race..As long as this Continues, NOTHING will change for us, 0r the younger generation ... Thank You Taraj for Not Accepting this Kind of Behavior in the Industry once Again & Again...Stay Strong our Sisters✊🏾...l Pray soon we WILL also be Vindicated like Monique FINALLY got hers... When ppl show who they really are 🐉 BELIEVE them...
I'm rooting for all my Melanin Sisters

She should be getting paid the same amount of Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt. ❤❤❤-Xclusyph Icon
Funny, she didn't mention that this role was different so Auntie O must not be paying them either. #Monique was right
Be a producer or director that's where the money at.
I wonder how much the actor's & actresses got paid for doing the original Color Purple movie.
Why take the role if you're not getting the money you want? That's like talking a job for $10 an hour knowing you want $15 then complaining about it.
Wow Monique been speaking on this for years Taraji literally up there crying tears........I guess it ain't that bad working a 9 to 5 at least I'm happy. Seems like Hollywood is the devil.
I feel her pain. I do not believe black actors don't translate overseas because if that was the case why are you doing the movie with them? Its greed!
And folks is out here taking down DEI and affirmative action initiatives cause its also discriminatory against them folks, this fight must continue
I understand that vibe please don’t think that I don’t but at the end of the day all I’m saying is this, You have millions to compare and to complain about there’s actually hungry and homeless people laying on the streets don’t know where their next meal is coming from!!!! Or better yet it’s single stress parents out here who work a job all week long and they’re paycheck doesn’t add up they don’t know how they’re going to pay all their bills they have to borrow from Peter to pay Paul so trust me I understand all of that but the math ain’t mathing for a lot of people like I said earlier you have millions and high 100,000’s to complain about its people who work all week sometimes 16 hours a day and their money still ain’t adding up so yes I understand that don’t get me wrong but stop complaining if you feel like your being underpaid I feel like you know that upfront the directors and producers will give you a round percentage of what your going to be making if it ain’t you’re cup of tea then DECLINE the offer I mean come on now when it’s time for you to negotiate if they’re not talking what your talking then don’t accept but don’t accept the role and the offer then come up here crying breaking down in front of the world when other people have their own problems going on that’s ain’t cool!!!!
Taraji is going about this the wrong way. This is business, she's got to think as yourself the same. Set your price!
We are in the future  year of 2023-about to be 2024, and these actors are still going through the SAME disrespect  as before.  We can't depend  on our own to do it because  they act just like the opp's themselves, but worse..it's not the industry it's who's negotiating  for you .
I’m really tryna understand what the director was getting at, can someone help me understand?
She’s speaking for so many of us, especially ladies!! Stand strong Taraji❤
I live in Australia. Taraji is very well known in Australia and New Zealans
We know the feeling girl ❤❤❤❤
Who is uncle Same represent.
Octavia Spencer said the same thing like Taraji . Keep strong.
Oh how my Section 8 heart just bleeds for these oppressed multimillionaires!
It have always been like that with  black women and men put on the back burn 🔥 when it come with pay .
Taraji you are the best. Try not to give up.
This poor poor oppressed millionaire!!! how is anyone supposed to get by on a few measly millions. How is any millionaire supposed to make ends meet, we should start a gofundme or we could all sell a kidney for this woman and send her the cash 😂😂😂😂😂😂 the math ain't mathin 😂😂😂😂 lmfao
She most likely voted for higher taxes, and she lives in the most expensive state in a huge mansion, so it's gonna cost a lot.
I'ma start with " the math ain't mathin " #2 Monique said it first!, #3 Pay these women what their worth!💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵
Negotiating your cut before any assignment is key Don't work on promises
Regardless of what anyone thinks or believes, at the end of the day it is a numbers game across the board for everyone, especially those that finance a project.  If a producer puts 100M into a project the expected profit margin rate has to make sense otherwise,  they are wasting their time and money.  Unfortunately with projects like this the demographic of who will be interested and actually pay to see the film plays a major role in how budgets are determined.  Unfortunately great talents like Taraji suffer because of these facts.  Being a great actor isn't good enough if the expected numbers don't make sense.
😂😂😂
Whatever hell he was saying 🙄
Everyone steps on us Black Women, Underappreciates us, Underpays us, etc YET they want to mimic everything we've invented, innovated and influenced.  No more begging for Flowers. The seeds better be planted, watered and soiled, so when we arrive we're walking into the GARDEN we deserve!! 🌻🌹🌻🌹🌻🌹🌻🌹
I am not a Black woman,  but I have always loved her work.  Her performance in "  I Can Do Bad All By Myelf " was riveting.  That is only one example of many.  Also, her work with mental health is life changing for so many people.  This broke my heart.  She is the best!
COMPLAIN COMPLAIN COMPLAIN😂🤣😂
I just heard that Uncle Sam died lol
Don’t give up on this  Things ain’t easy but always remember God doesn’t put you in a position you can’t handle. Keep on fighting taraji and believe in God.
Jews
Because  we don't  fight for each other as we should as we grow and reach top levels your own  people don't fight foe you but they play you in your face!but the white Producers make sure that white women get paid.
She got suckers feeling sorry for her lmao
Do it. Boohoo.
Taraji you will be paid properly with the power bestowed upon me from most high I will see you get you're beautiful flowers
She is in this position because her money management and investment skills are just not very good. According to her she makes 3.5M. She been in the game a while now, the numerous side investments this lady should have been putting her money to work on over the last 20 years would have ensured her against not being totally financially dependent on the motion picture industry. Further more, she could move to a lower tax state, downsize her team and so on, the mistake black performance in Hollywood make is that they keep forgetting that town is not owned, run or controlled by black people so stop expecting this big change that will never come. Technology is now available to the point that someone as talented as she is don’t even need Hollywood anymore to still put out great visual content. They get so use to suckling on that Hollywood TIT, that they no longer know how to live without it anymore.  All the crying in the world not going to change the nature of the business she in.
Everyone should  have listened and stood up with Monique; But no one did
She need to go play the powerball or something.
Is that Gail conducting this interview?!? If so….very ironic.
Don’t stop just start your own production company. We always want to stop, run, hide, go down south, go back to affika!!! There’s some deeper mental sh** going on with her. She reminds me of my older sister..
What is he talking ab? Yea artists want to make art that inspires and touches others, but this her Means of living. Giving her the job without the paycheck to match her résumé is not giving her flowers. That’s a slap in the face and to hear a black man say all that instead of addressing the $$ is honestly a different angle of the same problem. If BM just brush past it Every time we speak on racism, how can u expect WM to hear us?
I want to first say that, it takes courage to tell the truth. We live in a world that is transfixed on images and lies. It takes courage to rip the veil off so someone can see the real so big up to Taraji. But I do want to draw a direct parallel to our sistah Monique who expressed the same sentiments. Monique was laughed at, vilified, hushed, made the butt of jokes, told to shut her mouth and go sit down. Some people even blamed her husband for her outspokenness. Our own community vilified her but everyone is sympathizing with Taraji....why? Not saying she doesn't deserve it...but why does she get sympathy and Monique got told to shut up? I'll tell you...because anytime a black woman is dark and large she automatically classified as a "big black angry woman". Viola Davis expressed the same thing yet no one vilified her. However Monique came at it shouldn't matter when her outspokenness is for the greater cause. We need to stop judging due to the exterior and look at the bigger picture. I hope black female actresses can ban together to help each other negotiate better terms and contracts. I'm sure Oprah could find time to teach a Finance Masterclass for that!
Black people acting is different than White people. I think Tyson in Jane Pittman was the best Blk actress I've seen. Jennifer Hudson is no actress..it was given to her and Monique was who she is in Precious..no acting...wait a minute..Roc on Raising  Kane is a great actress..the entire class .oh those folks on the Chi..
No disrespect but  Morgan Freeman Samuel L Jackson Denzel Washington all get paid their worth.... celebrities like Monique Taraji chose their own path when it came to acting they chose to focus on Black Culture movies at a time when BLM is calling the rest of the world vulture cultures thieves you can't have it both ways.... if Monique is doing a comedy special that's all about Black Culture and you're making ignorant statements about other races... if you're knocking people but then you're crying because they're not watching your movies you can't have it both ways... example if your advertising a new movie and you're only focusing on one group of people why would anyone else be interested especially when you knock them down when they're trying to understand your culture and be a part of it
I completely understand what mean, even though I'm I'm just an average person.  I have experienced the same thing about breaking a ceiling and going back to table and having to start at the bottom despite your achievements and progress!
Taraji P. Henson hеr net worth is said to be around $12 million. That's all I'm gonna say.
She earns more money than every single person in this comment section.
❤❤❤❤ funny thing is most of the producers Taraji has in the movies she's acted in are blk......
Modern Zoot suits are still the weirdest clothing....
I feel like the director did not directly address what Taraji was concerned about. I think he went around and around and tried to talk her down from what she was feeling
Same thing Viola Davis and Monique has said
I love Taraji! She’s the reason I watch the movies she’s in. Without her, I’d pass on the movie.
I want to cry
We love you Taraji the underpay is unfair. I felt her every emotion. as if shes worried if she cant fight for her young black actresses coming up in the game behind her it upsets her so much!! but it isnt her fault
Modern-day slavery
Girl be blessed u got the life you got and getting paid to live a fantasy… you know how many black actors & artist more talented more trained more hard working then you that don’t even get to see the light of day smh… then you got half of us black ppl out here on EBT working intense labor jobs or things of that nature & you complaining cause someone’s got a few more millions than you, give me a break…say what y’all want but this is greed personified💯
Please never quit something that is God Given to you. Please pay the Queen what she never. She should have been being paid over 5 million a movie. She is worth more than that. I love Taraji she is so talented across the board. Pay Taraji what she want.
T performed excellent acting as "cookie" in EMPIRE.
Monique said the same thing but they called her crazy
but who'd she vote for? because Uncle Sam taking 50% is wild
Hello, Humans Terrance will never fade away no matter what the humans do.  TERRANCE OUT
Her net worth is over $12,000,000. Oh boo hoo
uncle sam the real problem. Then take our money to pay for war games
She is told at the beginning that “ it is heard on the street that she has the audacity” to consider quitting acting.  That intro is insult to injury.
Hi all. I hope you are doing well. I would like to share the good news with you. There is only one God. “Within the one Being that is God, there exists eternally three coequal and coeternal persons, namely, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.” God is the creator of everything, and he is Sovereign over everything. God has appointed his only Son to judge the living and the dead. We have all sinned and broken God’s law, such as lying, stealing, lusting, anger, and pride. God is Holy, Just, and Impartial. That is why when God judges he cannot let even one sin from anyone go unpunished and that punishment is eternal hell. We can’t work our way into heaven and our good deeds can’t save us from our sin. The bible says all our righteous acts are like filthy rags. We would perish if we died and faced God with our own righteousness.   The Good news is that God is also Love and Merciful and sent his only Son to save his people from their sin. Jesus who is fully God and fully human, lived a perfect life and never sinned. He willingly went to the cross where the Father took the wrath that his people deserved and put it on Jesus. Jesus paid the price for their sin and died on the cross. He was buried and on the third day God raised him from the dead. God commands all people everywhere to repent of their sins and to put their trust in Jesus. Biblical repentance is a change of mind about Sin. It’s an attitude of the heart, genuinely turning from sin to God. Everyone who repents and puts their trust in Jesus, will have their sins credited to Jesus, and Jesus’s righteousness will be credited to them. Their sins will be forgiven, and they will be given eternal life. When it’s time to face God, he will welcome them into heaven because of Jesus’s perfect righteousness.
Time for her to start her own shit .She deserves better!
She's amazing! Pay her properly!!!!
She ain't quiting , believe that ; even if she's only making fractions .
TEARS don't move them! You can cry all year Taraji, THEY DON'T CARE. SO WHAT IS THE SOLUTION? How about acting/filming in different countries or join Nollywood/Gollywood, and build?!? 🤷🏾‍♂. If you big names join those studios, just imagine the positive shift that will follow! I am sure you ALL would be welcomed! If you all have a little, then you all should come together with all your ''littles'' and go make your own Movies/Film Studios/Movie Studios. Unite now or keep crying forever. Is this not possible to accomplish?? or do you just enjoy begging to people that DON'T CARE ABOUT YOU? 🤔
Yes expose these rich people in hollywood
Oprah want all the money ya heard what Monica said bout Oprah she don't want to share the wealth like she going to take it when she leaves this world#sad
Taraji ❤❤❤❤. You are a brave Woman. Whatever decision you make you are loved & appreciated.
We’re all underpaid so, welcome to the real world girlie
This is nonsense she between 150,000,00 and 175,000.00 for Empire a moderately successful show over 6 season and 20 episodes. "Deserves" has nothing to do with views for tv ,streaming, or box office ticket sales.
Give it to God.  Remember man is not to be trusted, only God. That industry is ran by the enemy. Don't let it kill,  steal, and destroy you.
I'm Nigerian. The  thing is this dynamic is not going to change. We know we're right - but it's not going to change anytime soon (don't care what anyone says, I'm convinced it is not for the next 50 years. Both history and the present cement this). So what next? Create your own enterprises and cater to the audience that will follow. The Black American movie industry has legends in the game, and at this point relatively significant wealth. This can certainly be mobilized. That "equal revenue" may or may never come (reality), but at least the community charts its own path as it wishes.
Get a 9 to 5 then
We feel you Tarji whatever your decision is we support you. Your fans we always love you. That's right stand up for equal pay. ❤❤❤💯💞🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
If all of these great and powerful voices could unite and say enough is enough. Mo’Nique said the exact same thing…different verbiage but exact same sentiment. We MUST start paying everyone equal!
I’m trying to understand what he’s saying. Did he pay them what their worth or not?
All this crying Lesson to  adults  Ditch the weird expensive clothes  Invest in tangible assets So you're not tired of work when you're her age  Even wealthiest people have responsibility
This is wtf Mo’Nique talking about!
I would love it if she quit. I’m tired of this lady. She’s been in everything and if she hasn’t saved that’s on her
Yes, thank you!  When they won't let you in the game, make your own game.  Produce, direct and give a voice to the bright, talented black women who can't brake through the glass ceiling.   I love everything you have done.  If you leave, they have won! ❤
Let's just say you made 10,000,000 on a project. 50% of that is taxable income, which leaves you 5,000,000. 30% goes to your team, that leaves you around 2,000,000. If you cant survive off of that, you're an idiot, because that's more than most people will ever see in their lives. Be smart about what state you move to, your expenses and stop trying to flex rather than invest.   Most of the country makes a median income of 40,000 - 50,000 if they're lucky. 4,000 is taken out of that per pay check, unless you live in the state of Florida. Cry me a river. This is why people hate Hollywood lol.
Taraji my idol u amazing at wht u do...please dnt quit nw...am overseas and I see u we see u SA  🇿🇦 sees u...u are loved❤keep fighting God's got u...bless ur ❤️
This interview so good, i had to pause it, lol😂
Don't quit cuz that's what Oprah wants you to do She doesn't want you to see the light, like everybody else season you.😢
I'm going to see The Color Purple because Taraji is in it. She's amazing. Oprah said they wanted Beyonce or some other artist, but I can guarantee those artists would not evoke the emotion that Taraji can. Period!
This interview reminded me of that powerful scene that Taraji did in Hidden Figures. I feel so bad for her. They didn't give her the Oscar when she should have gotten it. And she's not getting paid her worth. I would leave, too. I hope she doesn't, though, but I understand if she decides to.
Guys taraji literally acts the same every movie . Ghetto ghetto ghetto why is she gonna be a high paid actress . She cant change her voice aka JAIME FOXX shes one character in every movie ghetto black woman pls
All the way from Germany, we sending our appreciation to our beautiful brown skinned Queens in Movies. You are definitely an inspiration a voice crying out in the wilderness! We love your authentic voice Taraji💖😘 Mach weiter so! Wir lieben dich!!🫵🏽
Please understand that as a black woman in America, you're gonna always be overworked & underpaid, no matter what career you choose. Its fkd up but thats just the way it is. Only true way to avoid it or at the very least soften the blow is to partner up with a man thats actually worth a damn but unfortunately, too many BW subscribe to the strong & independent BS. The majority of BW are unmarried, like TPH, which means the majority of BW are more than likely gonna be working until its checkout time.
I could never blame a person of color who quits the acting business because of racism, low pay because of the color of skin.
Taraji, per your example: You make $10 million. Your team makes 30% of gross, which is $3 million. Uncle Sam makes $5 million. You are left with $2 million. First, it sounds like team is too large or they are taking advantage of you or you don't know how to manage your contracts. Second, the $2 million you have leftover is more than most people will make in their lifetime. I'm sure you have multiple $2 million deposits over the course of a couple years. That being said, pay disparity is real and maybe you should do something about it. Form your own studio and encourage other black actresses to strike the major studios and join you. Do something, don't just cry and complain about it.
That "not translating overseas" is BS. She's beloved throughout the Caribbean and in Europe.
No she won’t!  Pay or No Pay…The actors love the spotlight and notoriety. 0:53
Do y’all remember when TLC exposed the music industry when they won their Grammy.   They were the highest selling female group of all time and they were flat broke.
This hurt my heart to see her cry like that 🥺🥺 like wth Mann. It’s crazy how the industry is……
The producers of the Color Purple: Steven Spielberg, Quincy Jones and Oprah Winfrey were in the position to make sure their cast was paid fairly. Taraji was talking directly to Oprah about this. I’m not generally an Oprah hater. However, in the moment when Taraji is talking to a multi billionaire producer of this film about feeling undervalued and appreciated  her fatigue made so much sense. Because it feels like if a billionaire Black woman is not going to pay her Black actresses fairly then who is? And then it starts to feel hopeless.
She seems to be all about how great she is. Nah!
Dear Lord we bless you this day and we are abundantly grateful for the gift of life and joy and faith and hope in the God of our salvation. Come to Jesus today let him bear the burden, toss the load over to Christ and you enjoy the abundance of life he's given you. ACCEPT Jesus into ur life today , he is waiting for you to let him into ur life today. ❤
The BUS DRIVERS, the TEACHERS, the DAYCARE WORKER, the family CARETAKER is tired…😳😩🥸 Keep thriving!! All is well.
Taraji knows good and well that the marketplace dictates compensation.  She goes through what every other male or female actors go through on a consistent basis.  You get what you're worth.  If you can't negotiate it the check writers don't see it in you.  It's not how much you think you're worth, it's what the market says you're worth.  Otherwise, do your own productions and pay yourself.  Of course, anybody who disagrees with her and her ilk will be accused of misogyny or hating women.  But peep this: how many woman are disgusted when the subject is underpaid men?  Crickets.  Crickets.  And more crickets.
At 12 million u need more ....I make 80k n I keep working n I have to.
She is a great actress and she does deserve too get paid what she is owed. I will say this... If hollywood aint paying you what you are worth, then leave and build your own empire. With that many years of experience, she could most def direct and produce.
She (Taraji) is born Sept. 11th...is in a 9 personal year cycle this year...and that is one of her challenge cycles in the study of numbers. May she release, forgive and overcome this challenge cycle.
Monique said the exact same thing & no one supported her!!! She was speaking facts & truth!!! ❤❤❤
Says Oprah sat on couch acting like it was a sisterhood yet DID NOT make sure cast was properly paid. Terrible. You can see it on Taraji face then too! Like she was forced to do it!
"Now do the Math"? Well okay That's still at Least 1 mill that's hitting your account... Do you know how many people would be set for life with 1 Mill?
her net worth is 8 million dollars.  crocodile tears....
👁️This was deeper than just pay. Part of it. Was about what she's had to do to get these gigs! CASTING COUCH TAKING A TOLL!!!!!💯
She the best in what she do she brought tears to my eyes it'll never be another one of her and she speaking facts she been in the game too long for them to be feeding her like that
Awwwww. OMG!!
Love you!
Boo hoo, you netted 3 million dollars
So is he saying forget about being paid and enjoy the experience? If yes, did he not hear what she said along with the amen's?Sounds oppressive. I'm surprised TPH didn't interrupt all that! One of these days Black women will be heard, but it would just be nice if men would stand up for us more. I empathize with the Black men of old who had to watch us get raped because the alternative was them swinging from a tree and then they aren't there to attempt to comfort us afterwards, but this is almost 2024. Brother, learn something from your own movie! I said what I said!
LeftEye said it for music. Taraji saying it for actors.
This was so real.
She's acting 😂 this sad
U will NEVER,EVER get paid equally,Point Blank , STOP Complaining,Deal with it ,just Move on ,STAY or Quit,the rest of us have to DEAL WITH IT, UPS iß Hiring.
I'm so proud of Taraji of our beautiful powerful melaninated Princess for admitting and being passionate heartfelt heartful soulful caring I see Babe Girl your a Chosen One of light shedding light in a very dark enter into con tain ment in dust tri tree 🎄 a nasty 🤢🤮 tree 🎄 a brave Freedom Fighter my precious soul much respect and love my powerful melaninated Princess Sista yes it's worldwide 🌍 it's in society period as a whole it's just not the industry its in society period your protected by the Most High my positive powerful melaninated Princess Sista we Chosen Ones goes through witchcraft satanism sorcery attacks daily they are very scared of us we are shinning lights!!!
It’s funny all the ppl that have her back or defend her well you know …😂🤣
Yes, her admission of tiredness echos the ❤️ & soul of many POC around the world. We are all called Not to “place our trust in man”- other humans, for our existence & welfare for they will fail us miserably! The human nature is sinful- full of pride, greed, betrayal, self-pleasure. Only the unselfish love of Jesus sacrifice of himself to reconcile us to God & forgive, heal, restrain & remove this sinful nature can one find true freedom, joy & peace. Salvation through faith & acceptance of Jesus as Savior & Lord brings the rescue, healing, freedom & comfort these actors & billions of others seek. I Know I WAS  one (1)  of those who was set free!
She’s tired. She’s been fighting and she’s tired. Even the best fired with the highest endurance gets tired.
DUDE LOOKS ZESTY AF😂😂😂😂😂
Most movies are ritualistic anyway. Get out!
This is what Monique been saying and fighting against for years I love the movie Color Purple I have never done what I'm doing now went out and bought outfits to go to see a movie I'm dressing up in my purple proud and I'm going to support 100% Taraji P is one of the best gifted actress out here of what she do Taraji P Henson but YOUR HAPPINESS  and YOUR frame of mind is more important do what work and Best for YOU YOU ARE A BLESSED FORCE QUEEN
Holly weird is not gonna change. They do not care nor do they respect the tears. In fact they seem to dig deeper to hurt more. We have to put our feet down and say no more. Stop chasing the invisible fame and money. Most of us would be happy and could live with a million dollars.
Yea it is…. The Black women have to carry so much
NOWWW!!!… aint this the same cottonpicking thing Monique was saying…. But everybody called her messy
Should have chosen a different career path. Everybody trynna be rich and famous nowadays without doing any actual work. Oh I cant pay anymore for my 5million dollar property😢. Give me a break.
These days its all about ownership. A
I truly believe that she deserves the best because she is good at what she does❤❤❤❤
I can’t understand her pain at all but on some real shit no offense IM NOT TRYNA JEAR RICH PPL COMPLAIN ABOUT BEING RICH it’s not like their TEACHERS in which I personally think teachers should be getting celebrity money because they’re the ones EDUCATING us and preparing us. Her not not being in a movie ever again won’t affect my kids or me or anyone I’m the world besides her and hers… but a GOOD TEACHER not teaching any more will affect millions of families so HER complaining about not being rich enough foh with that … you don’t need designer clothes or the newest cars or rooms in your house that you don’t even use she can easily go move a modest life
Understood! But the one thing that you don't do, is come on social media crying about it! It makes you look weak, and that's just what they want! They consider that as keeping you in your place.....weak, whining and begging.  And the biggest problem with women in the industry is that they are too willing to compromise themselves.....principles and morals, which lowers their value, making them dispensable! A DIME A DOZEN!
this isnt just actors. ITS ALL black people with a trade. As an electrician, REGARDLESS of 30 years experience, I get questioned on a job, about how to install a LIGHT SWITCH!! How to bend a PIPE! I get told by hispanic  and white electricians how I dont know what Im doing, yet they have less than 5 years experience, and they only have experience in ONE environment, in ONE city. I Have worked all over the country. Residential, AND commercial.  troubleshooting behind people AND teaching people. Ive even created my own pipe bending assistant tool. when I use it? they say, "oh look, he doesnt know how to bend pipe and needs help!"  I say, I invented this, and have sold it on ebay in the past...  that doesnt matter. Ive been told that I cant install A LIGHT on a WALL!   this is black in the usa... If you took your acting to Nollywood? you'd be golden.
Sad to see wasted talent from pay. Pay these people scammers.
Monique was saying this and was dragged. Here the conversation comes again
Crying to Gayle ain’t go fix sht.she dgaf
I understand kinda you have walk in someone shoes. We are all having a hard time most of the time I can’t even afford to go to the movies. She is in a cut throat business, she may have settle to be an character actress and not the big star.For that business your name has to draw millions to that box office. Her name does not draw like that. Really Viola Davis maybe the only black actress that does, not even sure of that. To to really make that star money the movie goers when they hear that name I’m going. I know she wants to keep her team going, but just like big business the nasty word lay off. This is a cold cruel World. Most of us have to change our perceptions is my glass half empty or half full
pa thetic
But when Monique was saying this, y'all said she was crazy.
How pathetic. Think about all the regular people who work harder and for much less. This is GROSS
the "entertainment industry" is run by sick people. get out as soon as you can.
this hurts, but puts so much in prospective.
This woman just lost me as a fan, like what the f is that, based on her analogy, male musicians should be crying about how much Taylor Swift makes
I'll boycott her movies, wote with your money and don't accept this kind of behaviour.
Oh wow she broke it down for me in a way I never thought of. That's 80 percent of her income gone just in taxes and staffing expenses.
How about doing movies with Netflix and negotiating cuts per project, like how Dave Chappelle is doing it? I suspect Netflix deals are better. But also, we have the numbers to create our own Hollywood as black people
Publicity…. Got paid for interview AND now got all the sympathy from the chumps in the comments. Feeling bad for her performance here will not pay your bills guys. Turn to Jesus, He will sustain you according to His riches and glory.
Man, i wonder if she's practicing during this interview for a potential role in the MCU.
So she takes home 2-3 million for 6 months work? Quit your whining! She has worked consistently for 20 years. Net worth over 12 million.  Poor baby.
Mo'nique was damn near black-balled for speaking up about this YEARS AGO! Didn't hear or see a single soul in the industry back her up. She's literally been speaking up about the unfairness of pay towards black women specifically within the industry. Instead everyone there let the world believe she was crazy. She's probably watching this like "I tried to tell y'all 🤷🏾‍♀️"
At the end of the day, most international audiences are not going to films to see black actors and the majority of America has no clue who these black women are.....they are not as large a box office draw.....it's just simple facts
I truly feel this moment. Taraji is speaking for all black women in all industries.  They want us to work our entire life and soul into our craft for them but only want to compensate very little for what we give. But I love what the gentleman said at the end, that what we do is sacred work. Everything he said we need to be reminded what we do is important.    Taraji I see you and hear you. I appreciate your craft, I appreciate your sacred work. ❤❤❤❤
we as a people got to stop supporting Hollywood!!!
what Oprah doing for our Sisters?! She got billions right ?!
I did the math and it is mathing…if she can’t live off of 3.5 million a year then she should quit. I love her acting. But this is a very wealthy woman. only about 8% of Americans make what she makes…37 million Americans are living in poverty, she is a multimillionaire. The United States has only 8% of the population being millionaires so I can’t feel bad for her. Learn to live within your means that’s it. That’s the answer. God gave her a talent that allows her to make multi millions every year, and all she can do is complain….quit!
Forget the flowers, show her the M-O-N-E-Y! She more than deserves it!
I kinda feel bad for her and other actress's but look what happened when Mo' was telling Us and no one backed her up not even one time🙄
I was lucky to work on EMPIRE here in Chicago.  Most exciting show!!!!  Why did it have to end?
Wow, tell it like it REALLLY ISSS❤ Soooo Manny have sold their souls on the cheap and got nothing in return😢🎉😢. They just being passed on to a new master of deceit to get a dollar😮 Bet not hollar😮
Taraji, you have been my favorite actor since you came out every movie that you have made has made my day and I want to tell you baby girl to if u are you tired of not getting paid what you’re worth because you is worth it. You have made me laugh so much baby break them glass towers down and live your best life with your son sit back and chill. You have to  feel good doing what u do take a road trip like your movie? See we as women we enjoyed that movie so much so live your life baby girl you deserve it.❤❤❤❤❤
Of all the projects and movies and tv shows she's done she should have been set for life by now. Sad.
You can fight with your own strength and power all you want, but if you do not have the Messiah, Jesus Christ on your side, it is futile
I’m a Recording Artist stressful because of Jesus Christ I’m going to be an actor successful because of Jesus Christ surrender, everything to him and he’ll guide you and he will never forsake you leave you trust him you can’t lead on your own understanding your power you will fail
Never heard of her what African country is she in
That industry is meant to destroy your soul. It's not meant for the Most High children. If you want to prosper financially in that industry it is going to come with a price. I say get out and get out fast, there is nothing wrong with working a regular 9 to 5 and living a normal life.
All we can do is keep speaking up and fighting for what we deserve and hope and hope one day the world changes. Even if you don’t see it happening. It’s very exhausting, as a black person period,but as long as you work hard at your craft and keep speaking up that’s all you can do.
Quit acting an get a regular job 👌🏾make you some real money 😒
Yeah okay 😂 there are people out here with physically demanding, labor intensive jobs making scraps. Everyone needs to chill out. She said to do the math and so I did. Turns out she's a multimillionaire with a 3 million dollar home in LA and a 2 million dollar condo in Chicago. How do you think people in the medical field or even law enforcement and firefighters feel? C'mon now.
Wow we be thinking these actors are rich rich and actually they struggling just like us. UNCLE MF SAM Smdh
It's so sad as a black women we have to go through this I've experienced this in so many ways . I've even turned down money due to the treatment and abuse the industry shows women especially black women to go through I'm just glad everyone is speaking up . Took me 20 yrs to talk smh 😢❤ sending healing energy, strength and prayers to all Queens
She thinks shes worth more then she is !
She is an amazing soul. ❤
Never like one movie she has done sorry ..if your only there as a place holder whats the point this is called in it for wrong reasons 🤔
Mo’Nique was saying the something years ago
She's bought and paid for, play black victim
aww don't cry  Taraji God got you and you are such a great actor i love all the movies that you are in and you are absolutely amazing and is a great speaker please keep up the good work  stay standing and continue your courageous work 🤗
If you fed up of paying taxes in california and nothing is happening,,than dont vote for same person
This entire world is a joke. Government ain’t shit, taxes are bullshit and sooooooo many other things that are such trash!! Life is truly a fucking joke
Fuck the flowers, show me the money..,
NEWSFLASH!! Everybody who does not own the company is underpaid. HAHAHAHAHAHAHA, 50+ years old and still playing victim
This world will break anyone down 😢
I N D E P E N D E N T do you know what that means? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA, y'all not built for this, men get it done, not tears needed. HAHAHAHAHA
Taraji, all of us Black Women are Tired as hell 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
She should ask Oprah and Tyler Perry how they do it. She gets paid $10 million, they are worth billions. Gotta pay the game
Some people have no fucking idea, what real celebrities go through. Don't think just because there famous people,  they don't suffer or have feelings 😢❤.  There is no difference between any of us.
Man it’s sad but at the same time it’s good to see celebrities voicing their issues, because i wouldn’t think she’d be dealing with what most basic Americans are dealing with, working multiple jobs to make a decent living and Uncle Sam getting rich off of our hard work and she’s right none of the math is matching, i mean if my little 7am-7pm ain’t matching then imagine her math not matching.
This is just a ploy to get people to go get propagandized by the industry… don’t fall for it!
Powerful messages from strong voices 🕊️❤️ ✨ 🙏
i love what he said about auditioning, now why tf is Taraji auditioning for anything at this point , when kristen Stewart and jeniffer Lawrence dont audition for shit , fantasia i get cause she's new,  but Taraji , naw thats disrespectful  shes a vet .
Don’t let them tell you that black women don’t translate overseas. That’s a lie. In this day and age black people translate everywhere. We are entertainment. Always have been and always will.
Sound like she bouta get the bricks movin😂😂😂
Jeff,  Elon etc them can afford anything and look how the man them live smh but as black ppl as we make a money we buy big house car designer clothes now knowing the big house gonna need upkeep
Don't sale your SOUL Sis. T, just to entertain us. Bravo 👏 👏 👏 👏 take you SOUL back
Am tired of rich people playing victim
Live in your wages stop being ungrateful
I felt this 😢
I blame Oprah Winfrey for putting these black actors out there, knowing these disparities still exist. When she herself could have ensured this process stopped..we need more Martin Luther King of the world..
Wow that's crazy didn't see that coming..❤❤❤❤
These poor rich celebrities', I feel so sorry for them. She can't afford a second Bentley for goodness sakes. How will she get a second beach house in Hawaii? She may have to sell her Malibu mansion... imaging the disgrace.
That's what being a teacher is like. You love it, but you just get tired of the disrespect.
I don't wanna hear this shit. Y'all all should have rallied with Monique 😅
Welp, this is why we need to have active and passive incomes.  It's not just the entertainment industry, but all industries.  One must learn to pivot and be flexible.  All I can do is speak and be positive for myself and others.....
More like " The Pay ain't Paying"
Thank you Monique for trying your hardest to bring this to ALL of our attention, even when “EVERYONE” put you down and continued to KICK you down WHILE you were down as a Black woman!! 🎉
Terrence Howard said the same thing
Any industry, if you let it!!
White women in Hellywood speak up!!!!  You know the truth!!!
Diversify because your pockets depend on it.
Who?

Nobody gets paid their worth, also bye
She was not complaining about pay rate while during "empire" 👀🤔
I’m just tired.
I think it’s so sad that as Black women who walk different paths in life we ALL have had to battle this. Taraji and my fellow black women HERE ARE YOUR FLOWERS LADIES 🌹🌸💐🌺 hopefully one day our little black girls will be able to benefit in a positive way for the struggle we’ve had to experience 💖💖
Not sure what  else she'd do tho
Monique been saying this
ooooooo but yall made Mo'nique a laughing stock when she said the same thing
Rich people talking about being underpaid kills me
Taraji isn't an A-list actress. Meryl Streep, Denzel, Will Smith, Leo Decaprio, Julia Roberts...Those actors are brands who command $25 million a movie.  And they all have the Hollywood scars to prove it. Pay inequities in Hollywood aren't new: white females deal with it, gay men, deal with it, black men deal with it on BOTH sides of the camera!   Taraji, if you want bigger checks, work smarter and out work your competition.  Hollywood treated Tyler Perry far worse than her, he didn't go on social media and cry. He picked a new lane, worked his ass off and now he's a billionaire!
Why do they say, Africans Americans, don't translate overseas? Nothing is as universal as human experience. That is why, although most movies feature white actors, we never see as white movies. They are just movies. Pay black actors, what they're worth.
Michael Jai White said that " We don't translate overseas or We are received well overseas" is BS.
The future is female...they are fighting this as hard as they can...but women...specifically black women, will dismantle this ish. Wait for it. It's coming. ❤️🖤💚
❤❤❤
It's not just acting it's across the board with what does healthcare everything😂🎉❤❤❤❤
Im tire too shit try working in a factory and get pennys on the dollar so i understand where she coming from and its something that she like to do i hate they doing her like that but long as she still got her soul God got her 🙏💪🏿
Wonder why Oprah didn’t try to get this made by TPS instead of Warner Brothers in the first place yet Oprah has the money and power to build her OWN movie studio but in the promo of the film of the new color purple talks about women’s independence in this movie? If you serious about it then let it be more than just talk!!!
Monet dont matter tonight & it sure didn't matter yesterday, just when u think u got more than enough...
She just mad as Hell because she didn't get nominated for an Oscar like Fantasia 😒 😊
Keep praying keep fighting the Devil want wins for long God has it he is working trust it's not easy but hold 🙌🙏🙏🙏 peace and love y'all 💯
I love you!.MsTarji , Stay STRONG ❤💜💕No MATTER WHAT 💜
Expose them ending in the truth!
I remember Mo’nique saying a similar thing and being blackballed. They offered her 500 thousand dollars for a Netflix special, imagine how much she would earn after taxes and paying her team. While Amy Schumer was payed 11 million.
its says you can't be a good person and be on top ...
I Love Taraji she keeps it all the way real 😘🤗🙏🏾 to you Queen
Oh my gosh, how can someone live on millions of dollars
Oh my gosh how can she live on $28,000,000 a year
Ok so you take home 2 million from the 10 million. Whats the problem??
Love her
Thank you Taraji for sharing your pain and heart ♥️ You’re beloved.
200,000 that’s a year that she gets in her pocket. That’s more that most people get in one year  Take a break.  Stop trying to be strong as a man and get a man. We have to stop living beyond our means! 200,000 off one movie that huge
MY HEART JUST BREAKS FOR OUR PEOPLE. WHEN ARE WE GOING TO BE GOOD ENOUGH.
Who? Sorry, but that's why you aint gettin paid sister.
I thought she was a millionaire 🤔
I feel you. 💙 You deserve better.
Taraji it's gonna be alright.  You're doing what is right and the LORD is going to turn it around.  No matter what you decide GOD will lead and guide you.  Will be praying for you and all your fellow actors.  Too blessed to be stressed. 🙏 🙏 🙏
TPH  ain't with the 💩. They better recognize!
Thank god for this message because so many young people think Hollywood is the yes but the devil is a lair
She more than likely still gets paid way more than your average Joe outchea and enough to afford a comfortable lifestyle, so.....🤷🏽‍♂️
She's A list and doesn't get paid A list
Cried through the entire interview, not only because they're all having to still fight despite the fact they're supposed to have 'made it' but because they have been such an inspiration to me and many other black women for so long and still aren't getting everything they deserve, it scary to think if we're ever going to receive the honour, the protection and the support from anyone else other than other black women. I hope we can create something for ourselves eventually because our worth is alot more than what anyone else gives us credit for.
Omg 😢🥺🥺
0:12 the irony.....she just won an Oscar right there
I hear her......disparity between black artists and let's say 'others'. However all us lesser beings on the slave train work for literally peanuts can't meet basics.
Yawn…but NO ONE supported and stood up for Oscar winning actress Monique when she been spoke on discrimination as a black actress and challenged the powers! Next!
In the words of Dame Dash “ put your own money up and finance your own shit!”
Cry baby . Invest your money, buy real state , create other forms of income .
MONIQUE was saying it and call on all of you to join HER and DEMAND to be Fairly PAID .
She's is such a a hard worker. She's constantly working and does it only to keep her head above water.
She not gonna quit when she finds out how much we make😅😅😅😅😅😅
This is a SHAME. EVEN ACTORS NOT GETTING PAID. WOW
SUCK IT UP AND MOVE ON! THATS WHAT DADDY TELLS ME! LOOOOOOL! ❤❤❤❤❤❤
IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO DO SOMETHING ELSE BECAUSE THATS STRESSING YOU OUT! AND YOU TOO BEAUTIFUL FOR THAT! PUT THAT DOWN AND WORK ON A CREATIVE IDEA WHAT YOU'VE ALEEADY HAVE OR WHAT YOU ALREADY STARTED! FROM ONE SISTER TO ANOTHER! YOU GAVE ACTING YOUR BEST! ITS TIME TO PUT IT DOWN! JACKIE AKA JANET! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤I LOVE YOU! REMEMBER I TOLD YOU I DIDN'T GET PAID FOR TWO OF MY SHOWS BECAUSE THEY CAME UP WITH ALOT OF EXCUSES Y THEY DIDN'T OR COULDN'T! JACKIE!
Stop telling crying women "they have to be brave" she's been brave, that's why she broke down crying
Ya'll were clowning Monique, though. 😢
I like Taraji. She's such a great actress. But when it comes to her complaints regarding what she's paid, that however is entirely her fault I'm sorry to say. What I mean by that is, she's fully responsible for who she voted for. Being a *black woman in Hollywood* I'm almost 100% certain that she voted democrats and these idiots have really really high taxes. So yes the 50% is very high for state and federal taxes, then don't vote for people who will keep it at a higher rate. Also don't live in those states with woke progressive tax system. It's that simple.
Who is “they” call em out!!!!
I felt that. Hollywood is a crazy Business and now with streaming services it's gotten worse
All she is saying is basic real life stuff that all of us go through except she got paid way more than we do. Crying bc you had to pay “uncle Sam” half and you still got some million is just ridiculous. She is still one of the most fortunate people to do what she does. To have the kind of influence to then venture into a business is a privilege. And now she wants more? She sounds just like the other greedy rich people we detest. Crying bc your millions go to someone else today when we cant even afford groceries is so out of touch.
Praying an end to this treatment!..We love you Taraji!! Please keep fighting, God will bless!!
That's true! I'm not a woman but dangit it's hard out here for a Hustler. I'm bouncing from couch to couch, struggling from cents to cents, Spotify only pay $0.003 cents on 1,000 plays or spins. To promote and a song takes money, I don't have. We're fighting Russian/African/China/Korean Bots on our social media pages and on Spotify and Apple Music. Do I need to do a Go Fund Me Account? Look here I worked with Aaron Carter on music. I got the approval from Bob Dylan to change his composition of his song 'Forever Young' coming in 2024. I have a slew of well crafted, well remixes and taylored covers coming out like Shadow Dancing by Andy Gibb, Open Arms by Journey, Joy by Teddy Pendergrass and several other artists. All the while with no real compensation coming back. The fight she's having is real folks. Society needs to change to include minorities and Indie artist. TPH is no indie artist but she's treated like one when it comes to the meaty roles and pay. Just because you're in a Steven Spielberg movie doesn't get you the pay like that of Meryl Streep. Granted put both these actresses in the same film and Meryl Streep would get the Oscar and more pay. It's madness that in 2023 & about to be 2024 women are still fighting for equal pay, minorities are still consider less than. We put our hearts and souls in our work to give the public the fans our best, our all and corporate suits will not catch up with the general public, that is there's enough roles to go around. There's enough money to go around.  If you like this or feel the need to share/give then follow me on all social media pages and all stores.   Share in demanding better pay for the individuals that pumping out product good product for you to consume. ~ sincerely Matell  #synclicense #musicsupervisor #Licensing #Actors #WomenActors #Actress #BetterPayforWomen
Ur AMAZIN👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
This is so true that is crazy here I am admiring her career and telling people she stays booked and busy and her versatility skills while acting. When the other race  of people get paid triple  or guad tripple of what they get paid.  She through 10 million out there but the people of color are lucky if they get paid 1 million or more for a role or a movie that grosses 100s of millions or even billions it insanity.
Ain’t this the same shit Monique, was saying 👀but every looked at her like she was crazy and being greedy/messy
I don’t blame her. I been gave up ⬆️🤷🏽‍♀️
Stay strong my sister❤❤❤❤your work is not going unnoticed!! We love u girl
30% of 5 million is 1.5 milll soooooo she making bread
Beyonce wasn't lying when she said everything is a fight & they bullshit u.
OPRAH TALKING LIKE SHE KNOWS WHAT TARAJI IS SAYING... BUT WHEN IT ALL BOILS DOWN... OPRAH IS ONLY LOOKING OUT FOR HER SELF!! WHY WOULD SHE SAY THAT TO TARAJI..."YOU HAVE THE AUDACITY TO SAY THAT YOU ARE QUITTING"... I PRAY THAT TARAJI STAY IN THE GAME.... AND FROM NOW ON DO LIKE ARETHA FRANKLIN AND CARRY YOUR PURSE 👜👜 TO EACH PERFORMANCE AND TELL THOSE DEVILS 👹👹 TO "FILL IT UP"!! 💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰⛽⛽ AND PUT SOME TENNIS SHOES 👟👟 AND VASELINE IN THAT BAG TOO!! 👜 ALL THESE UP COMING SO CALLED ENTERTAINERS BETTER NOT FALL ASLEEP 💤😴😴😴😴👋👋👋💯💯💯💯💯💤
1st thought Monique
Does anyone know how much the cast got paid to do this film?
She might not be making what the white actors are making but what she makes in a year, the average black person doesn't make in a lifetime. Don't know why she crying. Her pay scale is still way above other women.
This Stuff Must Be Totally Fixed...     God Please Make Thing's Equal !!! Or Better
ALTHOUGH MY HEART GOES OUT TO TARAJI & OTHERS I WON’T OVERLY APPLAUD A FISH FOR SWIMMING. GIVING THAT SHE'S ONLY REGURGITATING EVERYTHING MONIQUE INITIALLY SAID YEARS AGO. AT WHICH I DONT RECALL HER PUBLICLY SHOWING ANY SUPPORT TO MONIQUE. OH AND THE PLOT THICKENS AS YOU GO WORK WITH THE VERY PERSON WHO HAD A HAND IN UNDERPAYING AND MISHANDLING MONIQUE….🤔
I did the math and you walked away with 3 million after taxes and after paying your team. Now the average person that works as a teacher or at the post office makes about 50 Grand a year that means literally and hear the math on this they would have to work 60 years to make 3 million. But let's just be realistic 20 years at 50,000 adds up to a million dollars you make 3 million in about 4 to 6 months worth of work get it together lady and be grateful be grateful what God not man and women has gave you quit pocket watching other people and be blessed and I say that from my heart I don't say that as one of these assholes out here trying to be sarcastic
Y’all got some nerve … Monique was telling us … Now Taraji say something and y’all stand up . Crazy … I been standing since Monique spoke up
ALL OF THIS 👏🏾 😭 The Math 🧮 ain’t mathing indeed 💰
When Taraji said and if I can't fight for the ones coming behind her...I felt that. When you do what you love and can't share the fruits of your labor, the job is just not fun anymore
I feel her. Plus they always put here in the serious roles all the time.  That can get exhausting and overwhelming. I notice that every time she's in a movie
There is so much power is speaking your heart. She's doing what she can to make change. Good for her.
So even this movie? Oprah wins the big check?
I'm so tired of seeing OUR people get slammed the way that we do!!!  We get used over and over and over again and it's upsetting to see her crying over something that she loves and takes a passion in doing.  I'm a new writer and to see this makes me feel like there isn't a place for me because I am a black woman!!!!  One day this will all change for us and I don't see how it's even legal for UNCLE SAM to expect $$$$$ out of something that she can't get back at the end of the year, why in TF is UNCLE SAM getting half of anything, where the FUCK is our reparations?  BLACK FOLKS NEED TO WAKE UP...to hell with how many times people watch us on the big screen GIVE US OUR FREEDOM
I felt her pain,now i understand what Monique was trying to tell us.
She's speaking the truth, when you know your self worth and being denied, its insufferable. You do get to the point of just walking away from it all.
If they didn’t want these ladies, who did they want instead?
BLACK FOLK IN AMERICA ESPECIALLY THE BLACK FOLK WHO ARE NATIVE TO THIS LAND. WE TIRED. TARAJI IM SO TIRED AND IM TIRED FOR YOU. JESUS CHRIST PLEASE KEEP US IN YOUR GRACE AND MAY GOD MAKE RIGHT WHAT IS WRONG. OH GOD WE TIRED. HELP US PLEASE HELP US GOD 🛐
How much she getting paid tho ? 🤔 if she getting millions what she complaining about acting aint no diff than sports everybody not getting max contracts and some players barely getting a couple mill but they key players in  championship teams
People are surviving on 50k and less.  Come on, sorry I'm not feeling this.  I know I'll probably get slack on my comment, but I'm not interested in rich people problems in this economy and affordability issues.  Give me a break.  People are on the streets.  Come on
Cry me a river.  We're all underpaid.  She's making good money as it is doing what she loves.   Sorry, she doesn't have my sympathy.  And for her to put this out now, when the lower and middle class are getting obliterated, is tasteless
I understand. Not fair at all. Even i am not famous but. I do small businss. They act like i was never there... I get it. I am Asian women too. It seems i am invisible. I understand you.. Its so tough filed you are in. You are beautiful person. Hope somethings start changing.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Every one out here getting pimp
Beyond any decision she might make, the industry may very well tell her “Don’t let the door hit you on the way out”. Take some business classes to understand how to get the math mathin, and work with SAG to bring about equitable change, but this crybaby, crying all the way to the bank meltdown lacks gratitude and grace.
That another reason why I refuse to give Hollywood one red cent.  I get my movies free at the library  If everyone did that, they would change there tune.  Money talks
Taraji dear,  find your peace in Jesus All your ways acknowledge Him and he shall direct your path. Your a good women Take care of your mental health  ❤
There are a few strategies to fix this issue. The only problem is it takes unity, courage and sacrifice. if the talent stick together and fight for equity instead of pay scale then it’s a different ball game. If talent put together their own fund or talent owned studios and production companies different ball game. We need to be able to see or know the real numbers. Being the highest paid talent means little to nothing when the one writing the check is making 100x more minimum
Hang in there Taraji...You are one of THE BEST...You know your true North and God Christ got you...Nothing wrong with taking a break but get back in the game...We know Hollywood is not good to talented African American artists...Remember Taraji...C. Tyson was not paid her true worth...Hattie McDaniel was not paid her true worth...Angela Bassett is not paid her true worth...I can mention many more African American women and men who are not paid their true financial worth but their soul and self-respect is priceless and the tribe will support you eternally...
I Absolutely Love  Taraji I Think she's One of The BEST Actors/ Actress ive Ever Watched!!  And I Feel Her Pain!!! And I'm Happy she has other irons in the fire God Bless you Taraji!❤Marie
All yal need to walk off that dam set!   Do what Tyler did!  We need to have out own.  Hire other subordinate Races.  Yal all will be fair.
Damn!!! She said wtf am I doing???? I felt that wholesomely!!!!💯❤️
I felt bad for her until I learned she was into spirituality. Black people live right and get to know the real Jesus Christ. This is a part of the curse on the African diaspora.  Deuteronomy 28:34  The fruit of thy land, and all thy labours, shall a nation which thou knowest not eat up; and thou shalt be only oppressed and crushed alway:  So that thou shalt be mad for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see.
I don't feel sorry for them.   They knew what they were getting into.   They knew that they were to be literally used for entertainment.   They wanted the fame, the glamour, the glitz; and that in the end they'd be thrown out on the streets.   Spending all that money on the high falutent life instead of making responsible investments to secure themselves after the game is over.   It's not sad, at all.     If they're so tired,  they don't have to work much longer because Ai is gonna replace them all anyway. 🤷🏾‍♂️
Sis speaks for ALL Black women. We are TIRED.
Oprah short changed her to for her pay masters
Who did they want to put in it??? 🧐🤨🤔🙄
The Entertaiment Industry is despicable in their treatment of minority actors.
So is this why Oprah treated her so cold when they were doing the photo shoot outside??
Her networth is $12 Million fux Hollywood start your own business invest wtf 😒
These black directors are having women like her play the same stereo typical roles.
I haven't been seeing taraji in a lot of movies lately like i normally would see her.
So, if she Quit, what's Next? Will she find a higher/equal pay job? She crying about millions and I'm exhausted about hundreds.
Well that's what you get for playing all these negative stereotypes! You have nof advanced our people you've held him back!
Nah this gotta stop
Wow I have always liked TPH she definitely deserves her pay 💰 a great actress 💯.
I understand her frustration, but I don't not feel pity.  Taraji  has a net worth of $12 million. There are so many other Black women who have significantly less money to work with and still must make ends meet.
They don't want to pay us because they want us to be the permanent underclass
RIPPED ME WIDE OPEN! I feel the pain. I'm tired. A Black woman in America...I'm tired too.
Thats how i felt. Been self employed for 5 years now with no regrets. I refuse to let others dictate my worth
She's talented, she's just not a box office attraction. The majority of her leading roles in recent years have been in low-budget films. Low risk, high reward. They're not drawing in the masses but if they are successful, they make a modest profit. In recent years, it is very hit or miss if they're successful or not. I speak about this because what you bring in dictates your worth. You can be talented but if you don't draw the money, your paychecks will not have the zeroes you expect them to have. She's not getting treated differently because of her race or gender. She's just not getting the big paydays because she doesn't create that kind of buzz.
When you sign up for bs. Accept the bs and stop crying about it later. I chose pay over passion. I make music for myself and work for myself. Im not making someone stay wealthy and I can't even get rich. Unfortunately, once you sign up for this, you have already sold your soul sis.
😄😄😄 the last time I complained about my salary... The response I got was  "nobody told you to work there"
(2:44) I know that's right...
Make them PAY FOR YOU LADIES! Make them pay your worth! 😢i pray you don’t stop nc I love you and respect your work. But I know you’re tired. And I can’t ask you to give more than what you can give. We support you. You do you, baby.
If you stand with Taraji stop watching YT movies or buying YT products until Blk Entertainers are provided the same opportunities and the same peofit margin.  This includes fast food, cosmetic hotels, Hospitality, automotive companies, appliances, and especially so called European Luxury Goods; for starters 🖤🖤🖤 #BlackOut #2024
Hope her words don't  get twisted in the wrong way someone go tell Oprah they version of what they thought she said
Why do Uncle Sam gas to take what they don't work for or contribute too maybe 🤔 society needs to make change there first 😢why they have to half don't cry TPH 😢dont quit You know Monique spoke of this same thing and got black ball by her own peers took years to get back in I hope they dont black list her too see poor people will see at you have more money than average you're recognized by public you have fame dress well live well better than others 😢but I get it that others get paid more than others but it's the world we live in 😢its give or take world 🌎 so dear just save up your funds if you're retiring cause real world job pay minimum wage 😮😮
boo hoo I can only afford 10 Gucci bags and not 100 😪😪😪
Man, there are aspiring actors that would do anything to be on her level. I think she’s being a prima donna. She’s been in some stuff but let’s be honest she’s not Halle Barry
I may not be able to begin to understand the struggle but she is still richer than the average human. If you can maybe live within your means and not in some huge house trying to flex you wouldn’t feel this way. I get underpaid too but that’s life right
Monique has entered the chat! 🖤🖤🖤
Taraji is not quitting because of the pay as much as she's hurt because she was excluded from the Goldern Gloves nominations. But Taraji can only blame herself for taking low paying jobs, even just to survive. She makes the decision whether to accept low lay.
This is across the board in all facets of the workplace I was Civil Service for 31 years I have a Master's...my annual salary was the max I ever got up to was $39,898 Yep...do the math. Kids coming out of high school make more than I made...I was the go to and with IT Skills... Not crying over spilled milk but women in particularly... African-American women if you're not associated with the Institution but you're part of the Organization you will be at the bottom of the totem pole. Thankful and grateful... now I'm fighting just to meet my needs. I have to work part-time to stay afloat. I quit 3 times...but the time vested was important to getting little rather than nothing ...is it right?.....NO #survivalmode..
The major problem: Why is 'Uncle Sam' always taking 50%?
We need our own shit period!!!!!!!
Don't  cry its blood on that money  or did the illuminati not  sacrifice  anyone? Oh they not killing  people  and destroying lives? But we chase thier money . No don't  cry rejoice.

Another millionaire complaining about how much money they have. What is it the left says, #eattherich or something like that
Most of the movies shes played in were by black producers. Tyler Perry, John Singleton, Pharrell.
You know we can just start doing our own thing right!
Isn't that what Monique said some years ago. She was blackballed for it.😮
Taxes are robbery. It has nothing to do with color. Vote for the party that lowers taxes. SIMPLE.
I am convinced the people who are saying Monique was right are the same people who were calling her crazy, talking crap about her, and calling her a problem. Especially people in our communities such as African Americans.
I understand her fully but I think the issues that many black actresses face especially ones with her extensive history of amazing performances is the view of black women in real life. They arent supported because they spemd more time propping up black men yet its one sided allegiance. Black men in general don't do the same thus lowering the value of their body of work. Just think about the many roles she's had and " black struggle love" was a common theme. Many times the black man is not providing, using her for resources or destroying her self esteem. Over and over again she is put in roles where she has to fend for herself. Type casting is one thing but its like she is shown in such a light that  a happy ending is not something you expect. Then her proclaiming the need for black men and calling them " kings" yet she isnt valued by them as her queen? Thats a problem imho.
Who are the “they” that did not want them there? Name these filmmakers
Yes sometimes you have to walk away 😮😮😮😮
God less you Taraji ❤ we love you and will miss you dearly but take care of you! Please understand young lady. I appreciate you and your talent so much.
Lord father God please share the fairness of financial advancements for our sisters that aren’t getting the justice. In these I pray Lord…..🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾❤️❤️❤️ Amen Amen and Amen!🙏🏾
This is so sad I hope this goes viral and and people who own all those high movie companies take this into consideration it’s not fair at all someone who has beautiful talent and 20 years in the game devoting her life to what helps people have to still go thru the struggles as though she was never there 😔
Awe 😢😢😢
Then what is she going to do?
The hell with the flowers, where's the money. Y'all thought Mo was crazy for speaking out...
Take stock in your project and take the rest in money 💰
They do black people wrong. This lady is a excellent actress. Pay her right.😢
You know anyone can relate to her frustration,  but we have to stop knocking on the same doors that let you in. Look at Josephanie Baker had to leave America in order to be treated like a queen. France treated her like royalty.  This world is too big to limit ourselves to just  one area.
I feel her pain but you don’t know undervalue and suffering until You are a black trans woman. Everything else is akin to first world problems.
Taraji, I  feel your pain  😢   it's like that in corporate, too.
The  level of respect for African American artists, needs to have risen, since  Ms. Hattie McDaniel;  the Past is the Present - the Present is the Past.
As a math teacher, it tells me that the government is the main heavy weight hitter. She said the government takes 50% of her 10 million. Which leaves her with 5 million. I say, the government who takes her taxes are the real thieves. They are paying her, but the government comes in and take what they want. I feel her pain. They take almost 1k out of my check and I'm just a school teacher. First lady said to me years ago, the Government ain't S***!
Bp should own everything they do and create. Or it will never change. We should have our own social media too.
I'm always weary when actors cry during interviews, seems like an audition.
I feel it too as a mental health therapist.  Thank you for telling the truth Sis❤
Every time i turn on the tv. Yeaaaaa Taraiji. You are a queen. We respect your choice. You got all of us through hard times.
Pay My Queen ❤❤❤❤❤ Taraj is the Best Actress in the Game!!! She’s my Favorite ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Man it’s hard being a millionaire
Because we have to not just succeed but fight fight and fight all this foolishness I fill her frustrating as great as she is
I feel, know, and experience (not in the acting industry)  the weight of the injustices as a Black woman in america😢❤
'What Men Want' 'Proud Mary' this was her chance to really shine and prove she can move from the small screen to the big screen.  And she showed, or failed to show, she doesnt belong on the big screen.  Happens all the time.  But because shes black, she can claim the hollywood isnt fair to black women card.  The truth is, until another "Empire" or "Person of Interest role" that fits her comes around - she's going to have to stick to camoes here and there - and thats really a sign of an actor reaching their expiration point.  Shes a type casted actress - because she doesnt have the versatility that will help her stand the test of time.  Happens to white actresses and white, black asian actors all the time.  She can cry all she wants - but it doesnt change the fact that shes run her course.  Time to start doing something else - and for her it sounds like there is not anything else she wants to do.  She dont make the rules, the consumer does - and the public has spoken, they dont want to see her in movie roles..  END OF STORY
It's the truth . I went through this.. The job gave us bonuses and the government got 45  0/0 and the end of the year you pay taxes again on the money again and I'm not no movie star😢
Educate us! Taraji I thank you, appreciate you and love you forb embracing and sharing your gift with SO MANY! The first shall be last and the last shall be first! LOOK UP He's got you! NO WEAPON!!!!!
Monique has been saying the same thing but wasn't nobody supporting her they acted like she was a problem and crazy
They didn’t say nothing when Monique was complaining about this a few years ago.
I can't speak on actors but across the board in the industry, we're all getting killed with our rates, union or not... while executive pay is going up exponentially, literally taking it from all of us.  My union (IATSE) LOSES money every negotiation... I was part of layoffs because my salary rolled over plus 3% cost of living increase; amazing review, promotion a month later... then two months later, laid-off in a salary dump.  Now, the "minimum" rate per day is $100 less than when it was when I started 20 years ago.  Not the same or more... $100 less.     She won't quit, and I won't quit... because we all LOVE what we do, it's in us to create... and executives at studios and production companies use that against us, knowing there's a line of people around the block begging for these jobs.  But, she's 100% right in that it's hard to make a living here in LA and afford a mortgage here for some 'just decent' neighborhood.  People outside of our industry and city think it's so "rich" and glamorous to work in this industry but it's really not... it's fun but it's hard to make ends meet here at almost any payrate.
WHEN MONIQUE SPOKE UP AND WAS BLACKBALLED NONE OF THESE BLACK ACTRESSES HAD HER BACK especially Taraji who was making money playing Cookie. Now that they are struggling, they want sympathy. Entertainers have more than enough money and talent to pool together and create their own content. Everyday people are doing it with less to work with.
When Monique spoke she was shunned. No women stood by her. so taraji my love 😂in  my Monique voice. baby I tried to tell you.
We all TIRED.
I understand, Taraji. It's crucial to prioritize your mental health and take the time you need for self-care."
THE MATH AINT MATHIN💥💥🔥🔥
Too much racism in the industry .Treat black actors with the same respect as the white actors.
When you think about it. . .   This is a speech to all of us kinfolk. Our human experience is being challenged to a different extreme. We're all tired but like Blitz said "we have to be strong". . . it rings true.   It rings true for folks in the arts and everyone else. As a Black woman, I feel undervalued and unseen but i'm glad to know there are still embers of hope out there. We're all feelin' marginalized for some reason.  Lean into yourself when it's hard. Cuz when you have to be in that room by yourself, you'll want a champion in your corner. 🧡  Wishing y'all continued strength and healin'. -EJ
I feel Taraji give her the 💰 she's worth every dollar and cent
She really crying bc she understands that in order to get on Oprah status as a "Black Woman" she has to sell out. That's why she said "I want sell my soul." Until then she will not break through to the next lvl of Big pay 💰🎉.
TARAJI ❤We ALL stand With You.. WE LOVE ❤️ 🙏🏽You..WELL SAID.. RECEIVED.ALL FACTS. TRUTH 💯
Praying and now working towards fixing this and turning this around for the better.
It’s the Same for working class people so I don’t want here it.
If a thief gave everyone the same amount of pay, the money would still return to the pockets of the same robbers! 1865 SHARECROPPING 101 still exists today. They've only added air-conditioning. The "No-Gooders" get half of your labor profit.....Then you realize the hidden fees when it's time for your paycheck! In essence it's all the same; The legal Pimp and the overworked orphanage Ho' whenever there's a dollar switching hands. T.P. Henson? They can steal your pay but they can never steal your talent and ability. That belongs to our Maker not our mugger. The job you may lose but the gift stays and goes wherever you go!🙏🏼
It's sad that we at this place still in 2023 smh
she actin Like Terrence Howard didn’t get robbed Too… Talkin bout my sisters why does it always have To be about gender
This is the issue that Monique talked about and stood up for.
When MO' nique said it ...she was difficult 🙄 ..Now when SOMEONE ELSE say the same .... ALL STAND UP and applause 🙄  Such BS🙄.  Y'all should have supported Mo' nique in the VERY BEGINNING and y'all be All alright by now .
Notice how when its our truth and truest emotion we are counseled on how to deal with injustice. Now his words are beautiful but its time to stop being so damn cordial and create solutuons. We are far too damn accommdating. Come together for a strategy and stick to it..... Period... Save the soothing talk because at the end of the day, the money is still not given to the well deserved. Kick in the door wave the 4 4...just saying. Talk is. Cheap!
Here's my thing.  When Monique was saying this years ago she was trashed by blacks.  None of these people came to her defense or rescue.  I feel for our sister but let's please not wait till it happens to us before we speak up. Let's support each other when it's not us.
Everyone has to pay Uncle Sam and employees 😂
So I work a hell of a lot harder than she ever has, 60 hours a week every week, and I’m at the top of my industry’s pay grade, yet it takes me years to earn what she does for one pathetic movie. Quit your samn whining.
Same thing Monique has been saying for years, but she was being difficult.
Blame oprah and Tyler perry, they r taking money out of your pockets!!!
I think is Opera because in one interview Taraji said she never watched tcp and she wanted to do her own thing with the character and opera came out and said something about the original I have to watch the interview again
Guess they should have stood with Monique on the pay issue. They could be making more by now
This is so shameful how the industry is  so unfair especially to black actors  something got to give
Yeah, right. What will she do? If she didn't quit when she barely made $ why, quit now that she makes more.
I fight for my family. Blood or not. And making my sis cry ain't the move.. 🥊🥊 #JaYe101™
🎻🎻🎻🎻
I felt this in my soul
Professional POV.  I'm tired too. 16 hours on set is Murdah!
Open your own acting company... you're an awesome and talented actress...💯
They gotta stop with the 'black actresses should have spoke up for her' regarding Monique, and maybe Taraji and Viola wouldn't be having the battle they were having. What BLACK actresses were in a position of power in 2009? Look at the top 25 grossing movies for 2009 and the five years prior, black women were NOT given lead roles in those films. At BEST Halle Berry's blockbusters were supporting roles and same for Zoe Saldana, and Thandiwe Newton. And for all three of those women, their success is based not only on their talent but their perceived sex appeal or attractiveness.   Halle Berry's big starring role in Catwoman was a box office disaster but her highest payday at $14mil. Zoe finally got a starring vehicle in Columbiana but that bombed too. And poor Thandiwe has never had a starring film role outside of being alongside a man. Black women don't get leading roles nearly as often as white women such as Kate Beckinsale, Jennifer Lawrence, Sandra Bullock, etc. And if a movie bombs we definitely don't get second and third chances at those large paydays like men do. The problem is with the industry, and racism everywhere as we saw with Halle Bailey.
Shes got $$$$$$
I feel her pain because it seems the world is set up against us because we have to do strong and so much better just to have a fighting chance. And still we have to fight stereotypes from society while dealing with family and friends that put a toll on us getting to where we want. Stay strong black people and continue to show our strength and resilience while continuing to strive in this crazy ass world.
It is so ironic that this movie had Black production and nothing could be done about this? Like Terry Perry, has a warranted responsibility to do something about this. Oprah is a billionaire as well as Tyler Perry, why the heck are they not speaking up on this??! Like Taraji said, the math ain’t mathing.
When you're in a messed up equation, the only option is to subtract yourself. 😑
So, she only nets $2M/film, and she likely still has other expenses like lodging, airfare, ground travel expenses, accountants etc. $150K for her role in Benjamin Button was criminal!
So she wants us to feel her pain because she's not making more millions per film. I'm sorry, I'm  normal people and can't relate to show biz people. Why doesn't she do what normal people do, cut back on spending, scale down your crew, live within your means,  pick up another job. I'm just saying, that is how normal people do it.
I feel her PAIN 💔
I appreciate her honesty about the industry and Hollywood she’s really saving a lot of people that are chasing their dream to be in the industry letting people know it’s not all it’s cracked up to be
She is a really good actress!!! Her movie are really good . I hopes everything changes for the better for her— just hold on.
what you gonna do if you retire?
That money low. Extravagant life style and a Hollywood strike is catching up with her.
What in the world?
Man Monique crazy ass was right all along smh
Is that Tastee??!
You don't appeal overseas. They don't coddle you guys like America does.
You aren't white women. Sorry.
Gayle is so evil taraji is a Virgo with soft feelings why would she disrespect taraji like that talking about you have the audacity to say you're quiting acting.
Powerful director❤
Gayle is part of the machine & thats why she's always getting these interviews where she can push the machines agenda with the questions they assign her to ask. Pay attention to Gayles words of the beginning of the interview, " I heard you have the AUDACITY to think about quitting acting... ST...ST..STOP TALKING." That was a warning or threat from the machine through Gayle. She did the same thing with R Kelly & Megan the Stallion. These interviews sway public opinion
Damn the flower cut the check can't eat flower u can smoke it ..but the check u can cash 💸 💰 🤑... Oprah ain't shit
She may work hard and she may be tired, but that's ALL of us!! AND she gets paid, per hour, far more than most Americans.  Stop whining, make whatever money you make, and live within your means. Stop the pity party, you are blessed.
My sister!! I hear you loud and clear. I have been following you  since Baby Boy and you are one of the most free spirited, talented, astonishing, lovely , beautiful African American woman on the planet. Women always get the short end of the stick. This is why Black women are special queens. We have so much to offer with our talent, skills and determination. God gave us a special gift to be anything we put our minds too. We have the' hustle' approach to provide, proceed, and conquer!! When you put God first in everything, you cannot fail!! Because He will provide all of your needs.  Guaranteed!! Continue your race. Don't lose faith. Strive for excellence.  Give God praise no matter the situation.  You are my inspiration.  We need you! God bless.
Let's see how different she start looking or becomes ill after this interview
Hollywood Producers know they are  F'N the African American talent since it's inception
As someone who works in TV, I completely understand where she's coming from. We worked our asses off making all of these shows and movies and the greedy sons of bitches who run these big companies try to fuck us over by not paying or even hiring us. Something needs to change.
I LOVE me some Taraji! She's ALL our sister friends, our cheerleader, she reminds me of Family.  I felt every word she said. No way she should have had to audition for the role. I swear if they thought they could have cast it with white folks - they would have!! And paid them what they asked smdh. You can't replace a talent like Ms Henson. Don't  you dare try.  Taraji if you need to break away for PEACE. So be it. We will be here waiting to support.  Monique wasn't crazy.  Why do they try and low ball they own ? SICK
I feel like Oprah should do more for these outrageously incredible phenomenal black actresses she knows what it takes to get what you deserve…. Why not stand with these women and show and help them get there!!??? It’s more than enough for them all to get it!!!!
HEY EVERYONE LETS ALL CRY FOR A MILLIONAIRE NOT MAKING MORE MILLIONS AND HAVING POOR FINANCIAL LITERACY 😢😢😢😢😢😢
We love you Taraji 🫶🏽 gotta do wats best for you
What Angela Basset make? She been in the game since the 90s. I know she better be getting paid.
Protect Taraji 🫶🏽
This is killing me 💔
This hurts me because I grew up watching this lady … the celebrity world is wicked
How do you know if youre underpaid if you dont know what everyone else makes? Who is telling her this?
There's too many people in power that look like me that don't get it.  Everyone in power needs to diversify the crowd around them. You want more and more people to be attracted to whatever you are selling. A good example is what SNL did. They realized a few years ago they need more than just white guys in there. Turns out most of the great skits of either women and or people of color. Just wish more Industries would understand there is a lot of strength in black women. Diversify the people around your inner circle if you are in power or simply get more friends that do not look like you so you fully understand everything that is going on
Reparations for ADOS in 2025. Celebrities should not endorse a political candidate if they don’t have a reparations agenda for 2025.
I saw her net worth and it literally said 12 million and the movies she’s made????? That’s really upsetting! 12 million is a lot for anybody but those movies she’s made should have gave her more!!!!! Soo unfair and she is soo tired. Poor woman. 💔😞
In the Words of the GREAT Chuck D , 🔥 HOLLYWOOD 🔥!🚒
Well, now she has enough money to retire...soooooooo if she's tired then she should stop. Go plant a garden and relax.
MONIQUE said this!!
Did Taraji just “left eye” us.
How come the director changed the topic to be about him and how he chose Taraji as a way to give her her flowers?  This is about money not validation.  It's about the coin. Not the approval. Money talks.   Black men are not an ally for black women. They aren't.  This guy just hijaked the ehtire plight of a black woman and made it about himself.   Black men are weird tbh.
This breaks my heart! I just can't...😭
I am not crying woe is me as a black woman, but quoting the fact from the US Dept. of Labor and other US institutions that track labor and salaries.  I can almost guarantee the actresses you mentioned earn less than their white counterparts and had to work twice as hard to get to where they are. I am middle class myself working in predominantly white industry. I can also speak from my own experience.
If Taraji isn't getting paid. Then who is?   I feel like black women get the shorter end of the stick everywhere especially in relationships with black men and financially.    Taraji needs money not motivation.  Pay her the money.
Sounds like she's just not very good with money.
This is happening everywhere at regular jobs. Underpaid, underappreciated, and just not given what you due!!!!
hope they give this lovely actress the funds she deserves. loved her in person of interest and proud mary.
@CallmeKinFolk did you catch that at 2:30secs 🤷🏿‍♂️ frfr;
so did the color purple pay? I agree but not a fan of Henson shes okay but I dont see an amazing actress she just gets roles she fits in nothing spectacular....but we do need the same pay as whites and as MEN
I feel the same way about being an owner operator out here in the trucking industry.  We hauling all this freight for these companies and we get .1- .2 percent of that load. These loads we carry on our trucks are worth 180k and up smh
She's referring to BLACK actors and actresses. Blackish was a HIT show, but did you know that they weren't being paid adequately. 30k per show when their white counterparts was making that while their show was in syndication.  Racism is systemic and yt ppl play in our faces trying to act like it's all in our heads.
Such a talented lady.  I pray that everything held back from a monetary perspective be restored 100-fold for her and every person of color who has been marginalized and victimized.  This is *my* prayer in Jesus Name. Amen 🙏.
You are a beautiful strong Black Queen! God sees all!
I feel so seen! Taraji hit a nerve. That's a common feeling for black woman in all sectors. WE WORK SO HARD FOR SO LITTLE! The strength it takes to just be US everyday! No one will ever know.
Don’t just make money learn to reinvest it. Then you’ll feel better about your day job.
This hit my soul. Im just an ordinary Black woman who works in the Mental Health field and been working in Mental Health for 5 years and im TIRED. because ive trained people, ran a whole department when everyone else QUIT, I ran it alone and asked for a raise 2 years ago and still havent gotten it. I love what i do, but what about my Mental Health? I can't afford Christmas but they building a 45 million dollar school for kids who cant read or spell! And not to mention hate going to school. It burns me up! And i worked my way up to my own office and yet, this Black woman can't even get a raise or praise. But its all right. I got something real good for them next year. And im gonna be real loud and clear before i depart from this place.
She is awesome, she explained that Math, and it's real, and it needed to said.
I hope she gets of this business as soon as she can. No one is worth that much tears and pain! They refuse to pay you, find another way to make money. Fame is not worth it!
Taraji P. Henson is worth 12 million dollars.  And it just seems like she is masquerading her greed (she wants more money), as virtue.
Taraji is only worth 12 million, that’s peanuts in Hollywood! That woman deserves way more per movie!! She is one of the best actresses we ever seen! Pay that woman!!!
Taraji is aging gracefully. As you age your salary may decrease because they are looking for the young lady or man star.
Its very very important for Black people to start there own companies and business and support each other  because we are still looked at as slaves its goes so deep they just make it look good but it not 💯💯
Hip Hop is WORLDWIDE.  Overseas love Black folk everything.  Stay STRONG SIS. ❤️
"Giving her, her flowers?" Those ain't even real flowers. She don't need Disney flowers or real flowers. "Be and example?" You didn't hear her?? She's tired!!! He sounds like he's gaslighting.
Unsurprisingly, I am disappointed in boomer billionaire Oprah. As Executive Producer she could have fight header for fair pay, and she didn't. You can tell T & O have issues just from watching them during this press tour.
This is not the time! Why bring the cloud over a movie premiere.
Y’all need to apologize to Monique. Because when she said the exact same thing WITH RECEIPTS she got black listed and the black community turned their backs on her. Taraji gets all the support but let’s not forget Monique paved the way.
Wow!!! Damn that’s Hard as Hell I feel your frustration , Pain ,hurt That’s what Monique was saying this All Along…., Our white counterparts make just as much if not more money than our black actresses. It’s a damn shame and it needs to stop WOW you have to work 10 Damn Jobs Just to get ahead something is NOT RIGHT AND Taraji. She is spilling all the tea all the tea as well. Black actors and actresses has been saying all along. Don’t make no damn sense. My heart goes out for you girl you keep working as much as you can if you need a break, quit and stop.!!!
I feel her!!!, but it ain't just black women , it black man too . we're all in it together...CAPITALISM!!! That's why instead of being out of order, we should bond together ..
Amen 🙏
This hurts and heart pay this amazing actresses what she's worth come on 😢
I'm telling you Democrats and Republicans will take everything that you work hard for
Tyler and Oprah are getting all the money as if they need it...
The injustice! The racism! Solidarity with Taraji and all Black women artists who have been negated and denied for so long!!
Where are the Veteran actors like i.e. Dezel Washington Morgan Freeman, Will Smith, Don Cheadle.   They would great resources on how to get paid.  Everything is a process and you have to pay your dues.  She's a definitely a great actress and one of my favorites.  Actor's like her need to get paid their just due...ijs! 😮😢❤
I’m not gon front. A lot of you people seeeeeee others with a certain amount that exceeds massively from a regular person. But what you don’t know is that is the surface. Won’t know something because there’s people that keep facades of there surface. But when you hear stories…you understand that there are luxury thumbtacks 😂 lol. When you do proper research you definitely will say “oooooooou that’s why…..”. Everybody has issues…..
This is really heartbreaking to watch 💔 Misogynoir across all industries is the WORST
Y’all should have stood behind Monique when she spoke up. You watched her get beat.
Viola Davis touched on the same thing.
U are not the 🫥 ♀️.
I be Hollyhood. Tarji. Get those 👛. I'm glad u know your worth. Your value.👑💐
I hear Taragi. Lord bless her. She is a fantastic actress.
None of the roles she does are crazy. She plays ghetto roles it’s not hard lol
I almost cried as Taraji was speaking. Something has to be been done to fix those issues. To those trying to break the morale of those people who work so hard, that needs to stop and that will stop.
Fighting for those coming up behind you? Really? Taraji P Henson net worth $12 million,Halley Berry net worth $90 million Angela Bassett net worth $25 million. Average salary for a woman black white or otherwise $40k per year. YOUR LIFE IS SOOO FUCKING HARD!!!
The government is a thief!  Kleptocracy.  We need to collectively quit paying taxes!
I hope Ms O heard that
This did something to my soul. As a Black woman in corporate America I have always felt this. I just hope by the time my young daughters grow into women, this will not be their reality. How many more years will it take for people with brown skin to be valued?
Taraji is a smart woman. This should inspire others to fight for equal pay. This will hurt someone's finances but we have to begin somewhere. She said the math ain't mathing and the industry will steal your soul.
Taraji deserves better
Girl be thankful some people cant pay their utility bills, buy food, you are blessed we dont feel bad for a millionaire really?
Taraji is real he has sold out already in his speak
OhmyGosh!  I'm so shocked for Taraji, someone of her stature and acumen.  I would have thought she would be in the very top bracket of highly paid actresses.  But that same old offbeat song that TLC sang at the awards in the 90s, is still ringing in our ears decades later.  When can our people not have to deal with all that gunk all the frigging time😒🤔😡
It breaks my heart & soul to see us black ppl get treated like 💩 & dragged through the mud in every aspect of life no matter where you turn, it's supremely exhausting watching ppl eat off the fruit of our labor to be last on the totem poll
This makes me mad as hell...she is one of the best...why they do us like this...I'm so sad for her..sounds like my daughter on her job...just tired of the same bs.. Pay her greedy buttholes 😡😡
So basically,  Mo'nique was right to ask us to boycott.
Is she speaking to Gayle King? Very interesting
Please pay 😢Black women
So much shit happened behind closed doors we as fan don't have a clue,,, and on smaller job too,,,
It's sad for black women, but DISPARITY/UNFAIR TREATMENT is an equal opportunity for black women in any profession we choose to platform our purpose. I appreciate Taraji's transparency in sharing her pain and wanting her work to leave a legacy for young black women artists in the game.
Literally everyone with a job in America
You mean it's NOT great to be a celebrity?
Taraji is worth 12million. Do the math. GTFO
This rings true in every area of entertainment when it comes to the black community. Not just in the film and television industry but music, sports etc and that’s why I appreciate this conversation. Timing is truly everything, things are shifting!
👏🏿👏🏿🙏🏿✝️
This is done purposefully and if more ppl stand up like Monique, Tarahji  and more. Start doing our own thing for us... United State merica been  pimping us through history...
Crazy that she was married to someone from my high-school 😮
Sounds she isnt good with money or dating. She made some good money from her show
So black people don't translate overseas isn't adding up being that every time you look up overseas is trying imitate Black American culture.
I know TOO MANY talented black women who can relate to this. How many of us were made to feel ungrateful and ashamed for asking for more money? How many of us have been told "do you know how many people would kill for your job"? We don't get to negotiate like white men (and to a lesser extent, white women) do, because we're seen as less valuable and very replaceable. And on top of that, no one speaks up for us (even well-meaning allies), but there's a huge expectation for us to champion and advocate for everyone else.  Seriously, when is enough going to be enough?
Oh no,you're gonna stop playing make-believe for a living,what will we ever do. Come on now,it's not like she stars in movies that are grossing a billion dollars. She's got 2 homes and is worth like 10-12 million dollars. She's also educated. You need a better agent to negotiate with the studio or whoever. I don't feel sorry for her one bit. Everyone thinks they're worth more but we don't always get our worth,so should we go cry about it,no
It is, sadly, still the case that there is only be 1 Denzel-level or Beyonce-level performer "allowed" at a time after so many decades of Black people providing cutting edge entertainment in all media. I have always been puzzled how Brad and Tom and Sandra adopt Black children but don't insist on having some significant measure of parity in their professional gigs. I will throw Charlize in there even though The Old Guard has Black co-stars and a Black woman director. I can only hope the story shared by Octavia Spencer about Jessica Chastain being instrumental in increasing her rate happens more often but Taraji is telling us it is not.
The Holy Spirit is telling you to leave that evil industry alone.
😥😥😥❤🙏🏿
This breaks my heart. My wife is a singer and watching her journey in this and having to take less money just to be heard. The road gets hard and the artist takes it so hard.
The problem is not the pay the problem is uncle sam to be honest. Thats for everybody working. They should do something about that.
That Old Saying..  She Sold Her Self Short..SMDH
First time seeing this beautiful woman cry I'm hurt..I always ❤ taraji ever since baby boy before she was cookie.. beautiful woman ❤❤❤❤❤ i wish i can hug hergive her flowers
No way this beautiful, talented, lady should be feeling this way!! Again, do your own movies, shows, and plays! And produce!!
Yes she should quit Pretending being something she is Not.
I think her career went slowly downhill when she supported Juicy Smollet.  I think that sorta "tainted" her career.
I remember Monique saying they wanted her to pay for her own press tour costs. I wonder if Taraji paying for hers. She’s looks miserable 😖
She lives in a 6 million dollar house has a Chicago condo worth millions of dollars while many people struggling don’t feel sorry for you and your fake tears you aren’t that good of a actress Who said life was fair boo hoo
Ppl give Tyler Perry glory likes he's God but he's only Satan in disguise
It’s because of Oprah.
Wow
Oh miss me with the tears cookie. You didn't stand with Monique 5 years ago now you want to cry? Foh
why would it be about pay she just got paid and everybody and they mama bouta be at the theater so she's about to get even more.
This isn't just a color thing it's an industry thing. Uncle Sam taking his off the top no matter your skin tone or name. Then like she said the team then has to he paid off of the gross amount.
Do actors make anything more if the movie makes more in the box office? I assume maybe not or not much  Even so, we should come out en masse for Miss Henson and all of the lovely ladies in this film to show our support  It still won’t stop them from starting at step one next time with most people, but maybe it will change the minds of a select few 🙏
they get into the industry knowing the sacrifices!
I'm shedding tears now as I watch. It feels like my lips were moving but her words were coming out...I'm so exhausted. Every single day. I'm tired of the games people play in the workplace and expect women of color to just accept it. I'm tired of the micro aggressions and passive aggressive unprofessionalism directed at me all day, every day, in my supervisor's face, with no action taken...unless it's against me when/if I respond in kind. I'm tired of code switching...the list goes on and on. I feel you, ma'am. I felt this in my soul and stand in solidarity. Somehow, some way, we have to figure out how to not only survive this, but thrive and come out ahead on the other side of the constant trauma.
I pray you stay until God shows you your next move. Pray to God  for direction. You are amazing.
🙏🏾 This was so powerful!! 🙏🏾
Im sitting here teary-eyed, I see Taraji, I see Regina Hall, to us out here, we see women that have made it. To see Taraji's pain and realize they are being treated the same way like us. It breaks my heart, because what do we all do then? We give 💯 each day, they, our favorite actresses give 200 %. All I can say is Lord Jesus help us.
Literally, don’t care. For those of us in the working class who’s math REALLY ain’t mathin. We do not care nor do we have time to care about you crying when you have a net worth of 12 million at the end of the day. Downsize your lifestyle like us down here and your money will go farther. Period.
Rich people problems....I used to be passionate about these type issues but when I peeped how these rich black celebs all support each other when one 💩 on the black community for a bag, I stopped caring. They want everyone to rally behind them when it comes to them not getting equal pay or an Oscar or grammy but don't understand why we don't like anyone spitting on our black institutions, in particular HBCUs. These people live lucrative lifestyles, spending all their money on designer clothes, but want us to sympathize with them cause they believe they deserve more. Maybe so, but these are not my problems. Hell I'm underpaid too with double master degrees lol.
It's people that work way harder of all races that are barley able to feed their families so I'm out of this petty party victim nonsense
Let’s not forget when it comes to black movies and films we are given low funding for budget but always go number 1 in the box office and make 3x the budget and our ppl and actors still don’t get a big cut out of it.
She is acting like she is forced to act if you feel you dont get payd enough switch lanes lol  And personally i dont think she crying because of that i feel like she know she hitt the wall 🧱 unmarried no man single mother she feels the heat 🔥
And people talked about Monique....see, she wasn't lying!!!
She has a net worth of 12 million and is struggling to pay her bills. Please send me back to the 80's 🤦😒
T.Howard said the same thing!
This is America ! RACISM is EVERYWHERE even when they smile in your face everyday ! Taraji won't quit nobody else is gonna pay her whatever she's getting paid now ! No amount of money or fame is worth being treated like ur second best !
She has a net worth of $12 million. Her math says that when she does a picture for $10 million, she still gets to take home $2 million. That’s $2 million for, at most, a years worth.  If she doesn’t want to work in the entertainment industry anymore just means someone else will come along behind her and take those parts.
All this crying is nonsense
Nobody told her to sign that contract. Taraji signed the contract after her attorneys reviewed and communicated the checklist of 360 pay and obligations. It was up to Taraji to negotiate her salary. Why didn't Taraji support Monique? Now, she see Monique got a settlement from Netfix and equal pay. She complaining about her salary after making negative comments about Monique. Same with Terence Howard. Clowns!
The same person that defended Jussie Smollet by the way. Lol
Try painting bridges. Stop feeling sorry for your self.
If this season didn’t teach me anything taught me Jesus is my provider. Even rich people is in hard times.
I am really upset that she has to go through this. we suffer from the same thing and to know you're doing your best and being played with. It's hard to deal with .so to keep from popping off you cry 🙏❤️💜
Taraji you keep on pushing and don't give up. Peace
It takes alot for a artist to dig in thier soul giving there life essence to inspire and touch the masses human beings are batteries and when they give thier energy they can light and shed light to a whole world and when a artist gives that gift it shines even when there not here anymore but thier works is still here so I as a artist understand the business is cruel I guess thats why they use the term starving artist because the artist still starves because your life esscence is priceless no amount of money can equal to your value of your works I think that the individuals who are middle men have thier hands on the faucet and are like pawn shops depreciating ones worth causing the artist to dig deeper in thier soul to give more till its nothing left but the art giving with no commerce in return its sad
I feel for her. She's a powerful actress. But I'm glad that sista was smart enough to have other things going. But I'm sure it hurts her because this is her passion career and she's being it for a long time and still feels she hasn't seen really the fruits of her labors 😊
And she is an incredible actress
Hi Taraji, my wife and I are some of your greatest fans, and we love your acting, we have history-making technology that will level the playing field in broadcasting, but we need people who fear God and not man. please google Supervision Tech. LLC our contact info is on our website.
I feel her Heart… She needed to shed those tears… That’s been in her spirit a long time… 🥰🫶🏾🥰🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🖤
I feel she is a real one but i feel she is a great actress like angela bassist her portrayel in baby boy is timeless a classic the most underated acteress in history but one of the best all time
so tired of being rich!!!!!!!
Gotta huslte, i mean i feel bad i guess but i think we all know how  expenses and taxes work. And you  only get what you negotiate.
My black girlfriend gets paid half what white peoples get. She just barely makes a million per year after what this young lady said with paying your team and so forth. It’s not worth it. Especially when white peoples get paid much more for less work. The struggle is real! BLM ✊🏿
its just a sickening level of pretentiousness and entitlement, can't believe these people are real. acting work is not an entitlement.
i call bs...when monique was speaking up..None of them said nothing Viola davis..Nobody said nothing..so now 10 million a role aint enuff..gtfoh ..dont nobody care that yall aint gettin what yall see Jennifer lawrence get for her role...black actors have tyler perry Oprah , Jay Z..all those so called Powerful people an Taraji is Tired?? well sit ya tired ass down an let somebody else get a shot..Yall been acting in the business for 20 years..if yall aint figured out how to come together.. oh well..i feel she jus wants sympathy from fans..miss me with this B.s..black celebs problem is they have no unity watesoever..yea they all come together for BET and all the bullyshyt hollywood distraction..why none of yall never create?? so TYler Perry the only one with a studio..but tyler perry aint gon give NOne of yall a role for 1Million..lol..this is so funny to me on so many levels..maybe yall should quit buyin designer brands an go create instead of waitin on massa to pay yall equally...why tf would he do that?? Notice Gayle said " i heard you had the Audacity to think abt retirng"..as if taraji what the hell you gone do if you not acting..damn
Monique tried to tell y’all. Black actors need to stick together.
The math ain’t mathing 😮
Please pray for Taraji.  Sadness, depression, hopelessness ain't NO JOKE!  I wish I could talk to her, but I know the best thing is PRAYER.  It takes a spiritually strong heart to survive in this business, especially when you refuse to sell your precious soul.  I pray she keeps going, and allows the LORD GOD to lead her.  We hear you Taraji.❤️
Give me a break...talking about millions when 95% of her audience is making under $50 grand.  Get real Taraji...grow up and grab an apt. in the Bronx.
This life is rough and I understand what my sister Taraj is saying no one is not without discouragement you do what is  best for your well being
I agree with her bc it’s sad as a BLACK ACTRESS/ACTOR they don’t get paid equally or their worth when they are TRULY WORTHY!!!!! The Oscars are full of it too……whom ever on the Board for them are full of it……our ppl can only be recognized if they are long side WHITE super Star(ijs) when they are the ones carrying the MOVIE!!!!! I can go on and ON!!!!! So let’s be CLEAR everything she explains is TRUE plus MORE!!!!! For God Be The Glory we will become FIRST!!!! Love you Taraji as a Person, Black Woman and speaking your and the TRUE!!!!!!
Taraj is one of my favorites and I just don't know what even the great ones go  through ❤
At 1:44 That means you are not valued; when you should be greatly valued Taraji. We See You!
Thank you for your transparency. 💯
So she makes roughly about 3,500,000 from this deal and then she says she has other business ventures that she makes money off of. she has a 2.3 million dollar  house  and has four cars that have a value of over 350,000 thousand dollars im tired of celebrities  who make millions a year constantly complaining about how its unfair or how they dont make enough. but the average american barely makes 60-70,000 a year , i work two full time  jobs and i make 54,000 a year... Though i will say this female actors do get paid less than there male counter parts and that needs to change
She has been voicing this for a while. This industry is for the cunning, for the merciless…It is like politics you have to choose evil in order to make it big.
She entered the Game, Just learn to play it. She can produce her own films.  She has a following.  And when you negotiate, make it worth it.  And maybe cut back on Team expenses.  Everyone has their struggles.  Financial Freedom is hard for all.  We are in a Maintain state of living.   Take a pause and work on a new Game Plan...   You will get to where you wish to be...
Ummm if I could paid thousands or millions for the role I play entertaining my employer and coworkers.the audacity of these people who dribble balls through balls dress up for a camera and resite lines..how about being a teacher a trash person regular job with lil pay now that's something to cry about
Are ya sisters in the real world making as much as you?
She has always presented herself to be a sweet soul and I believe her conviction here 100%. Ladies before her has said things like this but hearing her and feeling the truth and sincerity behind it, it just hit different from her.  If you going to be working in that industry, it should be fair.  We deal with it on our non acting jobs from companies who don't want to pay us fairly. It is all across the board in different work areas.  She has worked hard for herself, family and others, but for us too because she entertain us and help the studios gain money.  I hope there can be an initiative one day where many of the black actors, directors, producers and writers can come together and formulate a plan to build their own hollywood that include studios, production companies, stocks and working with theaters.  We are the culture that everyone follows and we are what hollywood NEEDS.  Let take our talent and business elsewhere and that means starting it ourselves.
Baby this is the life and reality of black women we have to work harder than everyone else and make them prosperous then after pocketing off you and winning from your efforts when pay day comes you getting lesser than everyone else.
What does "we don't translate overseas" supposed to mean? 2:36
I had been noticing her on other interviews and was thinking something wasn't right with her. When I saw her on JHud show, she looked kind of sad, and I thought maybe she was on medication because her face seemed a little puffy. But I feel for her, as this is something a lot of us go through as burn-out, same ole sh*t, different day.   I agree the black actresses have to put on this smiley face and pretend, while on the inside they are suffering.  I know she took time off for 30 days or something and left the country not too long ago and came back looking rejuvenated.  Then came back to the real world, which put her back in a downfall. I hope she takes more time off, gather her thoughts and come up with a new game plan. I believe she has given all she can to Hollywierd.
I understand your pain but don't quit baby you're a great actress and I love watching you act I'm begging you and all of my black actresses to keep fighting for what you all are worth again please don't quit I love you from your biggest fan
I feel your pain, take care of your mental health it's so important
She & Christian Keyes are tired of being abused physically & financially in the industry when they use both tactics to try & destroy you time to speak out.
I love this woman 🫂
See working hard and not rewarded for it!! Her career will end soon and she looking at the work she has put in plus the money made isn't adding up... PERIOD...
I would not cry out to Gail or Oprah. I mean, the writing is on the wall. They hear you, but they don't   feel you. Either play the game or cry 😢 sad truth.
Taraji start your own production company. I’ve loved the work you’ve done. Such a class act!!
This is the same argument that Monique has/had!!  Ms. Tyson said the same thing and now Taraji (2023)!!
Nah she should quit! Why stay in a business that don't financially appreciate you but will have you working so much that you need 3, 4 hustles to continue. Yea stay strong but be wise.
Yes this is understood, it's  indicative of what black women go thru in any work place in this country.  I feel you  Taraji, we have to protect our hearts and spirit love . Blessings ❤️
🕯🙏🕯🙏..!!"BUT ALMIGHTY GOD ❤
I want to empathize. She works hard in what she does. I loved her work in Hidden Figures. It does strike me as odd when a black millionaire complains about life still being unfair though. From where I'm sitting, she is a very privileged soul with a net worth of 12 million dollars. I will work just as hard, in my own line of work, with no celebrity my entire life and likely never hit that level of wealth. It's just hard to sympathize with the one percent.
What does oprah has to say she has enough money to pay them since you wanted to redo color purple like really 😮I don't blame her🤌
U still a slave in that industry. They make the money. You  r the sacrifices when u put ur signature paper. We have to read everything. U could be signing all ur rights away
Quit n do what...😅. She complaining n aint gonna do spit!
well welcome to a man's world. u not going to see a man crying for going through the things men go through to build and maintain society 24/7. Jonathan Majors will not be seen crying after they just took his shit over one of your counterparts who was spoiled and entitled and abusive yet he got punished? ok. Taraji is subjected to the same thing everyone in this industry is, yeah they will take half of your money just like they do with everyone else, this isnt a you thing and they dont care about your resume, the industry u are in has n. Get with one of those rich guys who get in your DMS  and get married so u dont have to do this grinding , maybe u shoulddnt be in the grind, thats what Men have to do every single second to survive. you want to be like men in this world, then u cannot cry over uncle sam taking ur money  and  sharing money with your team. maybe fire some of your team, how about that
Taraji think the salary is bad in terms of Acting ( and it IS for people of color) but the average person is out here SURVIVING on $50,000.per year or less!!! 😔 Blitz was talking a lot, but not really saying anything...🤔
Have to build something for yourself. Start a production company, produce, direct and write your movies.
KEEP YOUR HEAD UP T.. CONTINUE TO HOLD TO GOD'S UNCHANGING HAND .. REMEMBER)IF HE BRING YOU TO IT ,HE WILL BRING YOU THROUGH IT, SWEETIE. MY HEART GOES OUT TO YOU AND I WILL KEEP YOU IN MY PRAYERS.  WEEPING MAY ENDURE FOR A NIGHT BUT JOY,JOY,JOY,WILL COME IN THE MORNING. OK.🤟🙏🙏🙏🤎🤎🙏🙏🙏🙏
Breaks my Heart!
I pray they all get their just do. They’re beautiful talented actors. That has to be protected, respect it, and compensated fairly.
Just find a regular job.
I get it, but like she said, inspiration don’t pay the bills. Something’s gotta give. If it’s inspiring, it should be worth paying for. They need to stop short changing people discriminatorily.
She has never been a heavy hitter at the box office. She can’t command those checks. Tiffany Haddish got those checks, and look at her acting a fool. She looks dumb crying about this. Why is it we just found out you can sing at 50+ ??? Sounds like she’s been holding herself back, not Hollywood.
The interviewer always saying "hmm hmmm" every five seconds was distracting
Ii feel so sorry for her I truly hope they pay her what she deserves
It tells me that you have a weak labor union. I know that actors are the last ones to get paid, and I know that bonuses are taxed up front at about 40% compared to income tax which is heavy by itself but less than bonus tax. I would look into LLC, LLP, non profit. Talk to a business law lawyer about options when dealing with these production companies.
Is that Gayle king
She chose this career nobody is forcing her to stay around 🙄 maybe if she stopped talking in slang she get better roles “the math ain’t mathing “ too old to speak that way.
It’s unfair how they treat her and so many others.
when people talk about seeing something.........its total bullshit.
THEY R' TELLING U IN YORE FACE U R NOT SCARLETT JOHANSSEN & WE WILL NEVER PAY U WHAT YUR WORTH! IMAGINE WHAT ERTHA KITT GOT ON BAT- MAN ?? IT'S 2023-24!! & WE'RE STILL FIGHTING😂😂😂😢😢😢❤ T.J. I LOVE YOU ❤❤❤❤❤
Monique tried to teel yawl💡!!
Wow SAD to hear, THE BUSINESS not a joke people telling the truth about what happened behind what really happened with the Business 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 THE COURAGE TRUTH HISTORY HALLELUJAH TAXES USA MOVIES 🍿 BUSINESS 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 Just Be Honest RESPONSIBLE for your Business everything is so very EXPENSIVE!!!!!!!!!!.:❤
Watching your work TPH has made me wish I had pursued my acting dreams seriously. You are incredibly talented, and I really wish you weren't given such a raw deal in the industry.  We need people like you on the big screen. Please don't give up. We love you 🙏🏾
The world fell in love with Eevette and has been loving it some Taraji every sense. Taraji's ability to " Hustle and Flow" has been shocking the world on and off screen for years! This princess now ordained Queen, is a Golden Globe actress who has been nominated for an Academy Award and has several Emmys! This Sistah is multi-talented and if that wasn't enough, she is also a black activist and a promoter for young black female mental health! Taraji's contributions to Black Star-Power has catapulted her into the Hollywood Walk of Fame, making her the 2,655th STAR! Taraji is one tough "Cookie (all puns intended 😉)"! We salute you Queen for all that you do!
And y’all was mad at Monique for telling the truth?
Virtual hug 🤗
Hampster wheel.....😢
i had the pleasure of being in an elevator with her one time ,she is literally so so nice 😢 this is so sad i hope she gets what she deserves!
My heart goes out to you stay strong the Lord will work it out keep the faith and trust in him❤
That’s exactly how us in the lower class feels. We work so hard and barely make it. It affects everyone. It truly does.
Unless all AAs get together and take a stand it will  stop
Poor thing, her net worth is $25million and I just don't know how she gets up out of bed in the morning. It's a shame with all the severely underpaid and poor black actresses that are just scraping by. Halle Berry, Octavia Spencer, Viola Davis, Oprah, Regina King, and so many more. If I were them I'd quit to and go get a blue collar job for $20/hr.
I ❤Taraji she's awesome you'll be rewarded
Taraji P Henson when u here that name do I need more
This should have been added to the strike issues, To fix the racial and discrimination that happens in the film industry to our sisters and brothers.
Taraji is an amazing actress and human being, she deserves so much more from this industry, and she certainly should NOT still have to audition for any role at this point in her career.
She deserves more money
Build Back Badangadang, pay your fair share!
They using Us. Thats what it means. You so Real. Stay Strong
Yep, many more should bug out. The few really talented ones will stay for all the rest of us. We are tired as well.
But taraji acting is average viola davis and angela bassett,octavia spencer are getting paid as much as male actors they are great actresses some people are better at their job than others 🤷‍♀️
Man this goin on at the top , that’s crazy cause it happens on every level
But , when Monique expressed this, she got ridicule and it’s a shame how people was scared and just didn’t support her
Taraji P. Henson, it is called Bidenomics. Bidenomics = Everyone gets free stuff, and nobody pays except everyone, "BIDENOMICS!"
Wicked Gayle stole R Kelly life with her lies. Gayle is very wicked and don’t forget her partner in crime Oprah both will get there karma for what they did to R Kelly. FREE R KELLY NOW
Man cry me a fckn river samual L Jackson work’s round the clock. Makes far less for low budget movies. She living better than 99% of Americans. We struggling for real. No one crying for us!
People forget that actor's are work-for-hires, just like blue collar workers. Long, strenuous hours on set. Unless you own other businesses or a studio, like Tyler Perry, it's hard to rise. One of the reasons Hollywood is built the way it is, is because they don't want these incredibly talented people to build and own their own. It's an incredibly hard and difficult road and it's hard to be able to take the leap. If you go out independently, it's hard to get press and they work to marginalze you. Look at what they tried to do to Tyler Perry, calling him a buffoon. No critic in Hollywood supported Tyler Perry. In fact, it wasn't until he was earning a billion and building the biggest studio on Earth that they even took notice. The system, like in every other industry, is built to keep actors on the bottom, and particularly actors that aren't straight white men.
Monique said the same thing and plenty people laughed at her
Do a walk out all the back actors they wouldn’t make it in the industry
I hate to sound like a jerk but, that’s what a majority of the people in the workforce deal with on some level every day. This just happens to be the world that we live in…We don’t quit, We win….So keep on pushing…✊🏾
it’s so crazy that the studio wanted either Beyoncé or Rihanna to play Shug Avery. That’s why he mentioned “there’s no paying this Superstar to play Shug”. just further proves that studios will always go for the lighter skin actress if they have the option.  Taraji has every right to feel the way she feels, but what crazy is that Monique has been saying this. That is she doesn’t fight for what she’s worth then what does that mean for the people coming behind her. But folks and a lot of folks in the black community was calling Monique difficult.
Soooo, when #Monique said this, y'all went on mute and made it seem like she was crazy!
“Calling you” is not giving her flowers. Give her flowers in the form of money and access if she’s truly appreciated by you.
This was so difficult to watch. This is a black women who is a household name and whose art has helped shape black cinema. To know she is still not getting equal treatment in this industry says alot about the industry. I understand those tears and i hope the industry values her as we do so we can continue to have black women pioneers in film like Taraji.
In all honesty working class women feel this as well
Lets address the elephant in the room. The team gets 30 percent plus taxes. No ma'am. Cut that team down to an agent or manager, hairdresser and makeup. The rest can bounce. She has a loyal fanbase and social media to her advantage. You can tell she is a loyal person and is got people she trying to carry but she can no longer afford it. Many Black celebrities and athletes make the same mistakes. Shes still very young and is worth about "$10m. I would hand out pink slips and just chill out until a project I really like comes along. Her buddy Terrance is letting people know these team of people are not doing their jobs anyway. Why oay 30 percent 😢😢😢
Monique tried to tell you guys that years ago but you would never stand behind her now all of a sudden you’re crying I like you Taraji but you should’ve been there for Monique when she was telling you the same thing about the little girls behind you
Me too boo. I'm tired too. Take 4 steps forwards, 10 steps backwards.
So does Oprah have power to increase her salary.
it’s crazy because i’m a 23 yr old black woman and i feel the same way with society and working shit is crazy
Inflation, inflation, inflation.
This just goes to show you that these Oscars in these Grammys mean if your not white. And I know people are going to say well males make more we're talking about women here okay
It means yall voted for the wrong party - but keep doing it
Oh my goodness, I am extremely grateful Taraji that you spoke your truth!!! That was very courageous and brave. We, as black woman, needed to hear that because it is the damn truth and it's all of our truths. As black people in this country, they still handle us a property as if we are worth NOTHING. We don't get paid a fraction of what white people get paid in this country for the same work!!! We work just as hard or even harder... This corrupt system- government- IRS that is place doesn't give a damn about feeding know one other than its own pockets!!! It is the biggest mob in this country. They take as much as they can rather you like it or not. Rather, you can put food on the table and feed your children. They don't give a damn!!! Your words hit my heart and pierced my soul💔 The Word of GOD says: Mark 8:36, " So what shall it profit a man to gain the world and lose his soul". Taraji love I feel you sis, from a black woman to another  black woman!!! It may look like the enemy is winning on this EARTH but GOD is still in control. The Father knew you before you were in the womb, and HE set you apart for such a time as this. For greatness. I myself think you are an amazing, extraordinary,  talented actress. GOD and ONLY GOD has blessed you for such a time as this. Thank you, sweetie, for sharing your testimony. I instantly started praying, asking GOD to cover you and shelter under is wigs!!!   When I saw the cast for this modern color purple I was leaping with joy!!! The first color purple cast was beautiful and I still watch it to this day. It is a classic movie and I know this second is going to be just that much better🎉🎉🎉.  Don't worry sis GOD didn't give you what you have because of you. He gave you His promises so that HE would be glorified!!!💙💙💙 #Andthisismytruth
Imagine us regular working ppl that have to work labor jobs and the math ain't mathing for us. At least she gets to travel and stand in front of cameras. 😮
It’s bad enough black people get paid less than the “W-others” but females get paid even less than males so after a 20+ year career we as black people graciously accept Auntie Taraji’s retirement☹️😊💚

You only recently became influential enough to use your platform to make changes. So black actors unite like the writers did that hair brand you have or had was garbage. I was supporting you and received Vaseline in a pretty bottle.
I think now everybody will understand what Mo'nique been tryin to tell y'all all these years. And y'all just turn your back on her. She might have been too upfront but she was being real and honest. She was just tired as well and frustrated, that's why she sounded so angry. And everyone gave her the side eye. Well, now listen to this... she was right all the time. It's the same with that taylor swift being considered the person of the year, when Beyonce ruled (and still do) the entire year, creating A MOVEMENT and not just a cd or tour, shifting the culture and impacting the world with "Renaissance". Or already sayin taylor swift is a billionaire, when her tour is still going and numbers are only projections (remember with Kanye, when he said he was worth 6 billion and Forbes came correcting him quickly sayin that was just projections of the numbers he MIGHT make from the sales of his brand, that it couldnt be considered facts already???). Same when Adele's 25 won album of the year over LEMONADE, i remember the sadness and frustration in Beyonce's face. She damn well knew that award was hers. Everybody knew. They even had the nerve to do it other times: with that white guy wich name i dont even remember and then this time with harry styles. Just to prevent Beyonce of being the all time number one AND with the major awards. We low key know Kanye was right when he climbed that stage. It was not right to do it like he did, ok i admit... but it was out of the same frustration and anger we all experience as black people. We been keepin it inside for too damn long. It wares you out, but we've been warned. We just don't like to believe it sometimes. We feel you Taraji, but we felt Mo'nique when y'all didn't or couldnt show it.
Hollywood is a very toxic and dysfunctional industry.  No actor should ever keep thier eggs all in one  basket.
C'mon industry! Pay for the talent you want. "It  will steal your soul, but I refuse to let it happen". Whewwww!! Praying we all get and stay close to Christ and see how he works to heal, provide, and satisfy all needs. God is able!! I know!. Thanks T! You are certainly seen and appreciated. May the compensation supersede your expectations.
It’s unfair where they control everything and we own nothing and if we don’t stand up together IT WILL NEVER CHANGE. People talk to sound good with no motion for us and be fearful of the outcome. Save that sorry talk if ppl won’t step then keep living your COMFORTABLE LIE.
Why do we as black people have to keep taking the bs that this country keep giving? Then act like we should just smile and be glad with the crumbs that's given to us. Being tired is an understatement. IT'S PATHETIC in 2023 that people are still being disrespected and NOT being seen as human beings. ENOUGH IS ENOUGH!!!
Black people we have the talent, collectively we have the resources... We need to get our OWN. Black people spend more money for entertainment than other races of people put together!
❤I feel you, sister! I love her transparency and training!
Quit then. Life isn't fair.  Go get you a 9-5 job and still be underpaid. Everybody works a lot. Stop playing a victim. Thats' tired. People don't have a place to live, food to eat.  Stop.no pity for you
Speak up my sister, cuz even in this moment, you are building your legacy that we will be proud of ..... you came from nothing .... I remember you from Kingsman Elementary to now repping the DMV as a whole, you have not failed us, we are proud of you and then some and on that note, consider yourself wise because when the wise speaks, the entire room gets silent... you did that and we truely love u❤
I think she’s an okay actress but she deserves to be paid accurately  She needs better people on her team negotiating for her
Im soooo pissed off💥💥💥i feel taraji p....pain
She is so on point. Ive only been doing this four years, previous career same thing… and I’m tired of the exclusion…
Comparing to Oprah, lol!
It’s absolutely terrible…. Even worse when you’re not living your “dream” at all. I felt the Uncle Sam part the most… how as a single person… do I have to pay 15-20k a year in taxes and social security… is beyond me… by the time you pay your bills, food and mortgage… you’re trying to save the rest for a rainy day.. and month to month it’s not much, don’t you dare want a new outfit. Lol. The system overall… with all of the corruption behind the scenes… and especially as a person of color…. Yes some days you are tired and over it.
I love Taraji❤! However, this reminded me that people aren't "bothered" by things that affect them UNTIL THEY DO. While she has valid points, so did Monique whom has been saying this for years, but very few people had her back or even supported her!😢😢
Have you got a permit to print money?
Not to diminish what Taraji is dealing with, but if the general public knew what production assistants get put through, this comment section would look a bit different.  We all have our struggles. Shoutout to the unsung: transpo, crafty, locations, catering, rigging, set dec, paint, carpentry, and set medics.
Freedom comes from ownership not being an employee... Without ownership your just a tool...  The black panther made billions yet the actors got crumbs
I don't blame her I have been seeing this for many years the low paying of black actors getting paid a fraction of what they are worth and the producers making millions off their names like Angela Bassett who has been underpaid for many years for what she is worth a superstar with the acting skills and they also refuse to give her an Oscar, what I say to these actors and actress is stop settling for less they use your marquee name and are making millions then pay u peanuts don't your see what is going on, don't let them use you, all I have to say is STOP SETTLING FOR LESS
Taraji definitely deserves to be one of highest paid female actors ever. There should be more black movie directors
I love her, she deserves the world. She is a true humanitarian as well. We know our work and pay system is BS, we ain't getting crap back at the end of the year after working that entire time. She's on point, it's not okay that folks have to prove themselves over and over again to get nowhere but Taraji will get her due, she's an inspiration.
The thing is she’s probably broke from acting because of her pay.. so she is technically living like an everyday person..
Now I’m crying.  It’s like that in every day life.  You work so hard and the pay check is not adding up.  I feel her frustration.
Lol uncle Sam and the math...
Wow, another princess.
Yeah well… your participation in the colour purple shows your integrity
I really never looked at it like this but thts soooo bogus ..sure they only doing tht to black actors ......
Regular people deal With this everyday Lol
I always enjoy seeing Taraji in her profession. I thank her for the sacrifice in the culture.
Black people believe anything they push in front of us. Oprah is giving TCP a bad look with the treatment of Whoopi and this is the ultra spin. Taraji turned on that Oscar level acting to reel the black audience back in so now we really wanna go see the color purple now🙄 great acting tho.
Breaks my heart!!! Don't get it dont want to get just would love it to stop. Enough has been enough. God bless 💜💜💜
I just had a conversation about this topic in reference to the music industry. Why aren't some of our female singers at the level of  Mariah Carey, Madonna,  Lady Gaga, Taylor Swift, Britney Spears. Beyonce and Janet Jackson are the only 2 that I can think of that have reached that status.
I see a Taraji and Monique partnership
#team taraji......love u sis.....
I love you my beautiful Queen 👸 on everything just too let you know I am so proud of how strong and brilliant you are just.by knowing your worth and your value you win it all and that is worth everything in your life remember you power is knowing that I did do it and I will stand continue standing  thank you for what I have learned from you all my life believe me it’s in my heart ♥️  💜♎️😇🌎
This touched my heart. I feel her pain. Black men & women are great at what they do but get paid WAY less! WE TRANSLATE OVERSEAS AND ALL OVER THE WORLD! We run this! How dare they play us down like we’re not pioneers? I know she wants to quit, but I hope she FIGHTS!!! I will stand behind her.👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽❤️❤️
Oh please. She not struggling.. she got more than enuff money im sure. But you know they always want more. Smh
Taraji We love you !!! Don't quit! Don't stop! God gave you a gift! Use your faith and your gift to keep pushing! We'll support you !!! Don't quit !!!
YES TARAJI! TIME TO SPEAK ON IT! MAY HOD COVER YOU AND FAIRNESS COME YOUR WAY! STAY STRONG!  I FEEL A GREAT SHIFT COMING...
Very heartbreaking!  #Hollywood needs to do better! There is no reason why black actors shouldn’t be paid equal to their white peers. It doesn’t make sense anymore in this day and age!
It’ll get better Taraji❤🙏🏽
Net worth $12 million, she, unlike most Americans, can afford to quit..
I just pray this sister Taraji doesn't hurt herself. She's been carrying around pain for quite sometime. GOD please give her the strength.
Shouts to Sirius XM!
Wow! I can feel her pain and see it in her face. She’s had enough, I feel so sorry for her. Keep your head up, praying for you as well.🙏🏾💪🏽
Isn't this similar to what Monique was saying. Where was Taraji when she was crying for fairness. I feel for all talented black women who hv to claw their way to fairness.
The industry,  is a beast. She knows, what she would have to do, to stay on top, and Taraji refuse to do it. I applaud Taraji, for not having to sacrifice anyone, including herself, a peace of mind trumps over everything❤
As a black man or black woman we still feel like we in slavery and she not lying they do play in your face look how they did Michael Jackson Prince Whitney like Michael said they don't really care about us if you not selling your soul then you are nothing to them I'm praying for you Taraji you will be ok just pray ❤💐🙏😘💪💯
I feel her & wish things were better!! Our community & neither our government will do anything to change things! Hell on Earth
Stop settling... You have to "Be the change you want to see in the world."- Ghandi Maybe it's time for you to get behind the camera or write a script... Maybe you can even choose a different career... Keep it moving!
As a person living paycheck to paycheck she lost me at the begining. Entertainers are over paid." My team gets 30% of my 5 mil"...gtfo. i dont meake near close to what she takes home after that in one year...i say cut the pay of all entertainers. No one should have that much fucking money while people are starving to death. This is what privliage looks like
Its sad that I found out in life as I got older, its all a BIG LIE!  People in this world is so PHONY!
🖤
OK -- so who EXACTLY is she getting paid less than? Give me examples. Look: It's called business. And as much as she thinks she's a star, she isn't. She's a great actress. But if you put her in a lineup of 100 actresses, few would be able to point her out, even fewer would know her name. That goes for thousands  and thousands of actors and actresses. Until she's the star -- Empire wasn't her show; Hidden Figures was not her movie -- and she rakes in huge numbers when her movies open, she will get paid what her agents get her. And that latter part cannot be emphasized enough. You don't like what you get? Fire your agent. Unless you have them onboard out of sympathy or pity, your agents are mostly to blame for the money you're making. I mean, you do realize she's a union member, right? She's getting paid her legally contracted dues. And true story: oscars and emmys mean nothing more than pats on the back and a possible -- read low -- pay increase. But if you go back 20, 30 years, look at actors who won awards, you're going to come away going, "Oh yea -- I forgot about them." My background is box office analytics. Taraji has minimal clout. And her ego needs to understand that. Her ego needs to know she's talented, but talent is second fiddle to if your movie was a 10 multiplier. Her ego needs to know that her whining about working hard? George Clooney just had to give up his director's fee to get a movie made. Mega star Clooney had to hustle. Spielberg got turned down left-and-right for Lincoln. Hustle. The star system has been dead for 20 years and Taraji was never one to begin with. So yea -- she's gotta work her butt off. So again: check the ego, fire your agent, and start making things that make a crap ton of money. Or just live within your means understanding you'll always get hired, and you'll make what you're worth and entitled to in show BUSINESS.
Because why did Viola Davis only recieve $250,000 for that last Hunger Games movie that came out this past November, but Peter Dinklage recieved $2 Million Dollars?!!  This shit right here is a problem! Mind you Viola had way more scenes than him is a E.G.O.T Recipient.  It doesn't matter what you accomplish, they're still going to PLAY you!
What has she done to her face? She doesn’t look the same.
Keep on the hard work Taraji.It's hard out here for Fjhai.I ain't got no money for rent
Monique told us
✨💌✨
Lol thats what we in corporate America  cry about everyday..I understand her pain..but 5 million versus barely $50,000/year..yea the math ain't mathing
Taraji, your perseverance in Hollywood is well noted, now it's time for no more "chump change".  So yes, this is why I stand behind you and in front of you to defend you from the economic injustice directed towards hardworking brothers and sisters and the opposition's way of thinking which seems to forever affect our race being globally accepted via our theatrical attributes in the film and television industry.  We need more of our own to fully comprehend:  "Black By Popular Demand" to allow our creative juices to flow as well deserved currency into the pockets and pursesof our people's performances, thus in helping our minds and communities to grow.
Really she from baby boy an alot of more movies😑what's wrong with these people when it comes to pay these actors thou.
I could save some, I can do my own makeup & hair & dress myself. A "ream" is not necessary. I heard Cameron Diaz say she only takes back end deals so she gets less upfront the paid on syndication/DVD, etc...
I wonder what Oprah is paying her for this movie.
They make millions for acting in one movie. Teachers and  nursing home workers can work the rest of there lives and wont come close to what she gets from taking a dam picture. If you ask me entertainers are overpaid. We make 60000 for saving lives and they make 2 million for throwing and catching a dam football. Smh this shit is soo backwards
Taraji, I pray that God Moves Mountains for you dear. I love your passion, and you heart, keep being Dynamic in all you do, Stand strong sweetheart.
She has always been graceful! Enough is enough!! She said the industry will steal your soul 😢😢🙏
I am a Black woman writer in Miami and I can't get the support because all they want to do is see you on the screen. I have 15 scripts and I have been trying every since I was 35 to get in. And the biggest issue is having to pay everyone and no one will budge or care unless you have money to pay them the couple of pennies and it keeps you from getting the millions.
This is what Monique has been saying for years and not only has she been black balled from a Hollywood mainstream but from black producers also AKA Tyler Perry, Oprah Winfrey, Lee Daniels and others. You can't tell me that Monique would not have been the perfect Miss Sophia
What he said was Great! But @ the end of the Day RUN THAT CHECK!! Ppl Over Seas Love Black American Movies! Stop it! Runnnn the Cash, the Dough, the Chedda the Cheeeeeese!
I’m not in the industry and I know how she feels.
Wasn't there just a strike about pay?  🤷‍♂️
This is nothing new tho. So why all the theatrics..
She looks so unhappy lately.
She is an amazing woman. GOD wants her to come out of the industry...because its, ....crushing her soul. Come out of the confusion, my sister.
I honestly believe that this will never change. black people need to stick together and build their own production companies and agencies. Take your Talent somewhere else
She said she only received 150k for her role on Benjamin Button!!
No lie. Yeah black people if we work hard, we can achieve anything. But the hard work that we have to put in is 2-3x more work than our other counterparts.  It’s tiring!!! Everything we do is second guessed!   I deal with it in my industry
Me looking at Oprah and Beyonce on the highest paid humans of all time list and watching this video of someone complaining about taxes who supports and votes for Democrats  as I roll my eyes and click on "Dog loves snow" video in the right column...
That’s how we regular folks feel hunny Boo imagine Not even making close to 1 million and uncle Sam is taking half your check in taxes. And our checks ain’t mathen either out here neither u are not alone!
Why did she break up with her fiance? I'm sure the weight of the world would have been easier to carry with a strong black man at her side. She looks like she is crumbling!
He not helping the situation or backing her up either. He's redirecting the topic by saying this film gives hope and inspiration. That don't pay bills!!! PAY US FOR OUR WORK, TALENT, AND CREATIVITY!
…and after y’all watch this, watch it again.
Amen
When are these big actors going to start their own industry with the network that they have?????????? That’s what I am tired of! Can we get a few more Tyler Perry’s business minds? They must also care to spin a decent narrative that heals!!!!
Industry doesn't value them. Not the work they do nor the fans that appreciate  that work if their complexion are not like theirs. And bottom line, if they're paid what they're worth, how can the gatekeepers pay for those extra homes, yachts etc?
[36] For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? [37] Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?
She deserves to NOT audition and she deserves the proper reward which is financial gain for her talent and hard work. Anything less than that is unsatisfactory.
Im a filipina, but i really appreciate her acting, shes really great actress.. ❤
We need to not let the world Rodney Dangerfield the black wombman. #UWILLRESPECTUS 🗣️We’ve created TOO Much!!!
I mean what is she making? Because if I’m not making enough I’m going where the money is.
You know, although we loved her is “ghetto black” roles, I truly believe it hurts in the long run. When you think of her, you think of Cookie from the series. She will have to dang near play a white woman in a role before she breaks the stereotypes her normal roles portrays. I hate this for our black queens in this industry! I will pray for her because I love her!!!
It's what Monique has been fighting for. Nobody in the industry supported her.
❤
When you accomplish goals and exceed successful with her  skill as an artist..you are not valued and you're not being honored or respected by those you work for.. !
Yall really think this woman gon quit a job were she makes more than most people lol? This is fucking cap, she just was in the color purple remake lol. I don't feel sorry for her, its people struggling to find work and she crying cause she a million short of her pay. Yall need to open yall eyes man smh.
AND THIS WHY YALL SHOULDVE HAD MONIQUE BACK INSTEAD OF BEING SILENT NOW WHOS GONNA HAVE TARAJI BACK
I feel her pain.  This is exactly why people go more the independent route so you don’t have to rely on the industry powers.
I'd shovel shit and dig ditches to make $150k in six months. Pay inequity aside, all these entertainers make a ton of money compared to most everyone else. They're not roofing in the summer, or working on oil rigs in the ocean, or sweating in a kitchen over a grill for 12 hours. They get to play make believe and dress up for a living. I'm sure their job isn't all cake and rainbows, but c'mon.
She’s talking about her white counterparts being paid tons more than her just for being white and having to grind a lot less and still receiving more.
Tell it like it is Taraji🎉
Good morning, don't cry😢 stay strong 🙏💖 God loves you.
I feel your pain sis and I’m glad that you speak up. You’ve been speaking up for mental health for everything and that industry that you in sucks for people of color. God bless you sis. God bless all of us because we still go through this in the workplace whatever workplace we work at and it fucking sucks😘🦋
I can't believe she didn't say thank you to the young guy that handed her a Kleenex. WOW, I have always really liked TPH but when people ignore 'the little people' (for a lack of a better word) especially these Hollywood ppl- that tells me all I need to know. As she is complaining about not being treated equal
We love you Taraji. We love you back when Viola Davis spoke about it we love you Kerry Washington back when she spoke out about it we love you to every BLACK WOMAN that spoke out about it but nobody was listening! We love you Monique back when Mo spoke out about it ! BLACK WOMEN - also Black Men have been under paid, and under valued in this Business. We love you all we stand with you all! But i  specifically stand with any Virgo Sister Taraji! Because us VIRGOS are very private and she has been expressing this for years and she’s a wonderful talented actress and for her to speak out and express the years she’s tired of the under value of her worth! We love you! 💟💜
That Uncle Sam is BS!! I’m tired too of working and the more hours I put in the more they take out.
I found the directors comments to be somewhat dismissive, Taraji had just expressed how she isn't being paid her worth and he (imo) just spoke about how the movie is about more than the money, it's about the way it changes people etc, surely it can be both? I don't know it just rubbed me the wrong way
Become a teacher. They make millions.
Ask Oprah Winfrey to pay you extra millions for color purple 😂😂😆😆........ Be thankful for your blessings!! Merry Christmas 🎄 🎅 namaste shalom shalom 🙏 ✌️
I remember Gabrielle Union saying  the same asome time ago. Ms. Henson, you are amazing. God bless and keep you. ❤🙏🏽✌🏽💯
Just imagine what actors are asked to do to get roles
I hope they paid her how she weighs for this movie.
Listen if we focused on black things . We can do our own shiiii . We have great writers great actors actresses . We are talented people we don’t need them .
You’ve got to pay to play, Taraji.
Get another job then
More black actors have to talk out loud about the injustices happening  in Hollywood. I felt her pain to the core, she's so underrated and very deserving of getting paid the same as the yt folks.
In all transparency I planned on not seeing the movie because I saw the first one once and it was very triggering.  I heard amazing things about the play, and that this movie was going to be more of a musical (akin to the broadway play), and I think the commercials and press looks great.  Nonetheless, I planned on reading the book since I never read it before.  I hope she knows that she was heard and that many black women empathize and sympathize with her experience because we too face many of the same challenges our own professions.  It is sad that we live in a society were we were born equal but systems and gatekeepers continue to find ways to devalue some just to increase the worth of others. That is why we have to know our self-worth.  We have to know our why.  And we have to push forward so the path will be easier for those that come behind us.  Just imagine what our ancestors went through!
Mo said the same thing and she was black balled for speaking her truth. So it’s obvious that our sisters in the industry are suffering and tired of the unfairness and being paid less then there worth.
I been with y’all everybody getting rich off our backs….
They don't value you, time to branch out young lady.
Monique been saying that for years, but they gave her a lot of pushback
You won't be missed
We love you you are appreciated unfortunately not by the people who are paying you for your god given talent. I can't stop watching HIDDEN FIGURES SALAAM -PEACE FONT'E THE INTROVERTED VISIONARY PUBLISHED POET SONGWRITER MAFIA SHORT STORIES
I really like this lady, but I can’t cry that’s what she signed up for and there’s people out here taking whatever job they can and getting paid way way less than her I apologize I just can’t cry for her
Most of these celebrities they don’t got it like we think
People thought Monique was wrong!!!!!
The entertainment industry is just a microcosm of America. Black people are consistently undervalued and under compensated in this country. True since it it's inception. On paper, we may no longer be counted as 3/5th of a person, yet this b s continues. So sorry Taraji and the others have to go through this.
I stand with you ! You said what needed to be said. As for you being an actress and business woman you are Greatness...don't give up.❤
I know she made more money than I have but I wish I could support our Titans more 💯👏🏿
Baruch 3:8-12 KJV
Until Taraji stars in a film where she’s the lead actor, AND said film is a box office hit, or even better a blockbuster, her tears mean nothing. This is the same type of argument the WNBA has with the NBA. If anything, she is overpaid based on this diversity crap.
If I had a net worth between $12M and $25M I'd stop working too.
Yes Taraji! Stand strong Sister. ❤️
She is so gorgeous ☺️. I pray that she really gets something fair soon and things are done to facilitate this shocking and obvious unfair side of the industry . 🙏🙏🙏
Damm and she done played in big films and always plays tf out her roles … ts is sickening to hear cause no credit whatsoever ….🤦🏻‍♀️I hope she receives her flowers soon 🗣️
Working hard? You acting and not a great actor. The wealth she has obtained the person at walmart will not have. She is ridiculous get a real job and see what hard work is. This is sad to see this wealthy person complain about money. When people are really out her struggling.
I remembered Viola Davis explained how no matter all the awards and work she has done: Oscars, Emmy, Tony, on Broadway, off Broadway  Viola stated she only gets a 1/2 of what male actors get and 1/10 of what white female actors gets.  Viola still have to hustle and work harder than most just to be called “The black Meryls Streep”.   Why can’t she just Viola Davis?  Hollywood has just recently opened their options to include black people in awards, movie roles, etc ONLY when being black or having black features became a popular options.  I felt Taraji’s pain because she came to Hollywood as a single mother with nothing and now being on top she is still being treated as nothing.  Hollywood: “Yea, you won awards & you work hard and yes, the other white female actresses don’t have all the awards like you but here’s 1/10 of what we pay them.”
Deception.  The pressure that comes along with the deceived lifestyle.  A lot of them are depress. Allah said it. I did not created man and jinns other than to worship me.  The devil 👿 (the deceiver ) pushes us to keep chasing the world.
Hurt breaking! tears in me and my husband as well, we did not know that black people in overseas still been treated like that and underpaid its outrages.
Who??
Didn't she say she got paid more money than she'd ever seen for POI which she decided to leave because she wasn't being given as large of a role as Michael Emerson and Jim Caviezel? This reminds me so much of the bit that Patrice O'Neal does "Oh I'm sure I'm going to care about this news story... yeah, no, nothing, somehow can't find a way to care". You accepted a job at a salary most people can only dream of. Oh no, you "only" make 20k a week and have thousands of fans? I'm sure those working 60 hours a week at McDonalds to rent a dingy 1 bedroom feel terrible for you. Where's your perspective lady? They will never offer you an insane amount, they start low until they hit a number you accept. You accepted this salary..
"i love who love me" - thats not love. When you have freshly born child - that child dont love you be cause its baby - you love iit and take care of it without getting anything back from that baby - thats love - unconditional.
Such stunning women, and men to be open enough to have this chat. Taraji and Danielle are stunning women and actresses. Taraji deserves her flowers. Love you both and I absolutely love The Colour Purple.
*that she probably, 9 times out of 10 CARRIES with her to work and displays before everyone which makes her a SPECTACLE before others. She's DONE-this us her last MAJOR movie probably..
We love you Taraji P. Henson
Ain't nobody working with this troubled little soul-people do don't got no time for dealing with her mental issues or patience to be dealing with her infrequent suicidal vibes, and pain and suffering that she experiences at home and CARRIES CARRIES breakdowns-thisvisv
I love her!!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤
Every one needed to hear this who want to go into the business
"..Taraji P. Henson is an American actress and singer who has a net worth of $12 million...."
Millionaire problems
Struggle never ends
I feel for her and I truly feel what she's saying
So arividerch luigi😂
Many people labeled Monique as "Difficult" when she spoke the truth. Actors, especially Actors of Color, risk being "Blackballed" for speaking out. It's "Safer" to be the "Acceptable" **gro. You're invited to all the parties if you act like you're okay with being dis-valued.
Beautiful, articulate, and talented actress. This interview goes to show that black men and black women still need each other. More effective together than divided.
I pray all the seats in every showtime slot and in every theater sells out beginning now until it's scheduled release date on a streaming channel and so forth...with GOD ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE! Let this movie musical break records by leaps and bounds; but most importantly let it be the movie that helps to renew Ms Taraji P. Henson's love of acting and place her among the highest paid actors/actresses in the world (because it's her purpose and divine placement by GOD) in the powerful and mighty name of JESUS CHRIST. AMEN 🙏🏽🌎🙌🏼📖💝👑💖📖🙌🏾🌍🙏🏻
It sounds like to me a lawsuit for discrimination
So true.I am sick of it.
This is the same thing Monique was saying but everybody was calling her a drama queen
It's so heartbreaking but the sad part is it takes tragedy after tragedy for people to wake up Monique been fighting this for years everyone thought she was crazy but now they realized she 😩wasn't if you just Google celebrity net worth the top white actresses versus the top black actresses look at the difference it is so disturbing how so many of them are literally in the hundreds of millions 😢 while our black actors and actresses we'll be lucky if they're in the double-digit million 😔🤦🏾‍♀️🙏🏾 and it's like other nationalities make millions from our Black culture tik Tok alone ain't no way you can scroll up four times without coming across something that's our Black Culture and yet we the most criticize hated culture in the world EVERYBODY WANTS TO BE BLACK UNTIL IT'S TIME TO BE BLACK 🙏🏾😔🙏🏾
Tarija was just having a moment, I pray she find the strength to continue because shes awesome on screen❤.  I seen how moved she was when Cisely Tyson passed.  She wouldve been proud of The Colir Purple 💜
Taraji looking good
I don't like when my sister's cry. I feel her pain... 😟  I know she's not getting what she's worth ( excellent actress! ), rarely WE do. 😡
Ok, so he said all that to say what?????  Give T her damn money !💰  I so hate when people got to take you down the street and around the corner just to get to a destination of how u got me f****d up!
Better learn from THEM on how THEY avoid paying taxes- if you are getting taxed on 50% this is pimping and robbery by the usa govt- and the fact you don’t get paid your worth, is all a crime.
🙏🙏🙏 stand strong 💪 glad you speaking up . Well said 📣🌹💜
Taraji trust me. I’m tried and I am not an actress or actor.  You pay taxes through the year and have to pay taxes at the end of the year. Love you.
She SO translates overseas, what a BS. They just don't want to be just and pay equal.
Monique been saying this, and she was almost blackballed in Hollywood. It’s sad . This is how the rest of us Americans feel that work 9 to 5’s 8 to 4s    And 7 to 3s and 12 hour shifts. It’s hard and unfair for all of us out here, both men and women , actor or non actor
She likely hurt her image because of her role in Empire. At the end of the day, black people can either build their own and not wait around for things to change, or leave the industry entirely to do something else. This is America, no one is forcing you to accept low pay or poor treatment.
Omgoodness!! So MUCH PAIN!!😢😢
Uncle Sam is keeping most of us broke
Shes also feeling some type of way cause the Golden Globes snubbed her stellar performance in The Color Purple. that is what I think is stirring this up. man I dont' blame her .
I believe Taraji is exhausted from the press push and needs a break. I also believe she spoke her truth and I absolutely believe her. Protect your peace at all cost. 😢
Everyone out here in this world feels and understands  Taraji about the pay. It's not adding up. We all tired, but why the fake Gayle show though?
The Hollywood system is absolutely evil to Black People and POC. They under cut our people, use our images and disregard our talent. It’s all bullshit.  It’s still a slave machine.
She should've never got down with the Black Boule it's all her fault Empire was Horrific but she wanted Fame now look at her crying Smh Regina King and Angela Bassett tried to warn her Oh well 😅
As it was ONCE Said.." SHOW ME THE MONEY‼️. STOP PLAYING 🖤🤎 PEOPLE CHEEP‼️
Wow no please don't quite
Hollywierd aint never been for Black people. Create your own production company. CREATE YOUR OWN! Stop whining about equity. It's a spiritual human choice......The world or The Bible.....you choose.
Wow!! I feel Taraji's pain here sho' nuff!! Damn! I just watched (again since it was on cable) "No Good Deeds" -- everything Taraji does is excellent as she one of a handful of actors that doesn't need a word to convey an emotion on screen -- her unique eyes are her alter ego!! What a talent!! She mentions her "team" -- well -- perhaps she needs to add a big power player attorney who can bust the balls of these studio executives who play that game -- where they pay certain actors more than others for the same roles!! Lou Gossett (incredible thespian, obviously) once told me that he was up for the same role as Al Pacino and while he was offered $3M -- Pacino's offer was 7x that amount!! Get the picture??
One thing people did at Mo'Nique was laugh, that woman didnt shed a tear on camera. Taraji is the complete transparency on what they all didnt allow themselves to do. These women are stepping into roles are doing amazing jobs like their counterparts but given chicken change. As Malcolm X said, the most disrespected person in america is who?
I think that you should get the amount that you want and deserve after everyone else is taken care of.  And after every film that you do you should be able to walk away happy not hurt.
U don’t translate overseas UNLESS you Beyoncé!!!
Who are we begging to pay us fairly and are we enabling them by willingly offering our talents and skills to their business? Time for our own industry.
Doesn't translate overseas? It is nonsense! I am big fan of Taraji and I'm from Eastern Europe! We loooove you!!!!
Taraji ...Ta Rhatid! Gal pon FIRE!! ❤💯🎭🎬
I'm a white Slavic woman from Poland, and I love Taraji. She's a great actress. SHE DOES TRANSLATE OVERSEAS. I also love black movies, black shows, Tyler Perry, the whole Best Man franchise - why wouldn't it translate? The whole world was watching Empire. This is ridiculous, and painful, that someone would think that Taraji's acting wouldn't translate. Denzel's does, why not hers? Talent is talent. It's just crazy and painful.
This is super sad to watch but in all honesty, as long as we don’t own our own media and write the checks, this will always happen.
I think she should try tv acting like Viola Davis and Angela Bassett did. It’s worked great for them.
Get a different jon
WE Are Praying for this Sister and all that may be going through something like this. Praise A'hayah ! BE BRAVE IS EXACTLY RIGHT ! Put on The Whole Armor of A'hayah through Yashaya ! And Stand in Yashaya's mighty name ! ! #Pray4Oneanother
Get out the business
It’s hard to feel sorry for someone makin millions
She looks tore up with that hairdoo what’s up 🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️
And Gayle doesn't give a F... wrong person to cry to
Because everything too godam overpriced in America right now!!! None of us can breathe! We all grinding hard out here I'm just a modern day peasant busting my ass for scraps! I worked almost 70 hours this week just so I can hand my kids a few hundred dollars for Christmas because I live paycheck to paycheck trying to keep up with these dam Bills! Groceries ain't even in my budget! People say oh you lost weight, yeah its called the inflation diet I don't eat! God bless queen I felt your hard work
While pple on Facebook, IG, etc with all these smiles, laughs, having the time of their lives...,most be frontin. Taraji just proved most can't be that damn happy....,lbs
Don't be mad.. Amazon hiring 😂
What Taraji is talking about now about being UNDERPAID is the exact same problem Monique had with Netflix, years ago. Most black people called Monique "crazy" & "ungrateful". They threw her to the wolves to fight by herself. Now, everything Monique said has came into fruition. She's been vindicated because now other actors are going through what she went through for over a decade, when she was blacklisted.
KALE IS NOT GOOD AT THIS.  IM ALL FOR NEPOTISIM.... BUT SHE AINT GOT IT.
I was working an an executive assistant to Kevin Hart he wouldn’t pay me over time, but expected me to work all hours of the day and night. Leland (pookie) called me they weren’t paying me overtime. The way black women are treated in this industry especially when it comes to pay is insane. The keep black women at bottom when black women work the hardest. I quit working for Kevin pay is an issue with black women in the industry
Did she get he nose done or something?  She looks different. Crying ain't gonna get you movie rolls. I don't even know what movie will be a match for her now to tell the truth.
I saw the tension, when she was at Color purple
So let's see  - who is financing the Color Purple? I sure hope they are getting paid for promoting the movie.
I think the director tried his hardest to derail Taraji statement of black women going in rolls, taking the job and getting paid less. I think he tried his hardest to only point out his work , the relationship he's grown and for his star workers to know that their work speaks out to a bigger and future audience. He tried to not speak too much about what Taraji just said. That's Hollywood for you. Cover their butts. Taraji do what you feel is right. Hollywood will swallow and spit you out and suck away your soul. Look at the world and what's happening now to all these future Hollywood music stars and actors. Life done caught up to them, and guess what it was not only life down caught up to them, it's now God Jesus his name done caught up to them. One by one God is taking the evil out, the Bible talks about when the evil will rise and  flourish they will fall. So one by one his coming. Hollywood keep  thinking money is everything, and not worshiping God. You best believe his coming. Some of y'all forgot you grew up in the church now money done made y'all forget your soul. 😢
Sounds like she really sucks at negotiating. You have to negotiate. Nobody is going to shower you with dollars. You need to know all the numbers and your value in terms of performance and past accomplishments to determine your salary. I learned it the hard way through life experience. Welcome to reality.
You are an incredible actress. How do we support you? Please what do we do? I heard Terrance Howard say the same things. Tell us what to so? Do we boycott all other movies? I am listening. Tell us.
We all tired of working hard!!We all crying about our pay!!Yall still better off than average worker..We should be cryin most ppl won't &dont see a million dollars in a lifetime...Yall(actors) should of been fighting for this..Did hear about this Pre Covid...Know your worth&get your worth...
Self pity - so hot right now
that’s why a lot of celebrities get out the acting world and go to school and get a degree. That’s why you should live humbly and graciously and have all your financials taken care of and not have lived above and past your means now I remember when Monique said she wasn’t going to do anymore promoting for the movie precious now I don’t know if anybody has noticed, but when Fantasia YouTube video about getting kicked out of her Airbnb from celebrating his birthday, she mentioned she missed her son‘s birthday which means that she was out doing a press tour for the color purple don’t get me wrong that’s fine but when you do enough press touring that’s enough but to miss your child’s birthday is absurd now if she would’ve said something about doing the press touring, then it would’ve went viral just like Monique and then the same thing would’ve possibly happened to her as well js 🤷🏾
Taraji is an amazing actress.  Stay strong and whatever you do I'm sure its going to set you free.
She one of the greats too. They will never give us a fair shot. We have to make our own shit. I love Tariji! 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾❤️❤️❤️
They are making a lot of money even then. Maybe if you could live without the unnecessary luxuries, you won't be broke after earning so much in such a such time.
Blame Sag Aftra, The union sold out the membership contractually....and blame her team.  We translate overseas but Taraji hasn't made a movie that grossed big over seas.  Select black actresses translate overseas. But hollywood in general is racist. 💯
I'm so proud of my sister speaking out telling the truth about how it really is 😊❤
People love you guys we want to see ya make a way for yourself you don’t need Hollywood
Make your own movies opening your own businesses we will support you guys
Thank YOU FOR TELLING THE TRUTH”YOU KNOW YOUR WORTH”
Systematic racism breaks you down on all levels
Salaries are negotiated up front.  There is no point of crying after the fact.    We seem to love selling “the dream”.  Unfortunately you can waste a lifetime chasing “the dream”.    Know your worth.  Ask for what you want.  Be prepared to walk away, or take what you were given, and be grateful.  All else is madness.
Pay her for her worth!
She acting folks 😮😅
Um where is our sistar’s Kleenex! Took long enough
Taraji poured her entire heart out and we need that conversation WITHOUT the perspective of the director who of course needs to get the conversation back to promoting the movie. I don't want to put too much on him until I see the entire interview and get more context but he definitely did not address or directly answer any of the questions asked of him surrounding the point made my Taraji of being undervalued and overuse 😢 I'm glad this comment section heard her though❤
Taraji got me tearing up.  Im with you Girl!!!
Isn’t there an actors union?  How can there be unequal pay?  People need to stop paying union dues if they are not defending you.
They do not want to pay and she’s been working for years!!!! Imagine
I wonder why Tyler Perry studios wasn't chosen to do color purple.  He always gives his actors flowers,  understands the black plight, and now has crossed over to white audiences.
She didn’t sell out or sell her soul..or drink the “gold juice” that’s why .. Keep God first Taraji ✨✨✨
I feel you Taraji .praying for our time to come . God promised us… it shall come to pass ❤
I feel this ❤
I totally understand where she's coming from but at the same time she got a rare privilege most of us will never ever get a chance at even tho they're not playing her what she's worth the industry still made her rich and famous!! Because the alternative is she could be poor and still trying to get her foot in the door because at the end of the day she's probably got a big house nice cars and a healthy bank account most people would die to trade places with her in a heartbeat
GO CREATE YAL OWN HOLLYWOOD THAN, MY BLK FOLK DON'T BUILD NO MORE, BUT STILL MAKIN' MOVIES LIKE COLOR PURPLE 🤣😂😂
I swear when Taraji spoke my mind immediately with to that part in Hidden Figures, when her superior asked her why she was missing sometimes..
THIS IS SAD AT 53 TO BE LIKE THIS, SORRY,  NAAAHHH, HOLLYWEIRD AIN'T THE END ALL, YOUR PERSONAL LIFE GOT YOU LIKE THIS, NOT A PAY CHECK
She deserves an Oscar for this performance!
Has it always been this way?
Idk compared to other Americans she’s doing pretty well. I understand as a black woman how it feels. But you are still blessed. Keep striving. And if you choose to retire that’s okay too
We're all tired. We all work. Sorry not sorry.
Taraji is tired of how being treated in the industry. They probably make a quarter to what their counterparts earn, which is disgusting.
Taraji p Henson 😢I feel for her and every black actor 🎭  that's not getting paid the same as white actors. But however and this is a BIG BUT Then maybe Taraji p Henson and Gabrielle union and other's should have spoken up when Monique was saying the same thing I love Taraji but Monique was saying the same thing and y'all acted as if Monique was crazy talking to ghost I guess Monique was right that she won't be vindicated until she passes away it's sad we can't stick together when it counts
Don’t worry about it sweetheart because you all know Holly weird and you will never measure up to them all tho they thought but GOD show you so again… I say don’t worry about it SWEETHEART… God saw YOU!!!
A damn shame...you deserve better Taraji!
How do Sam, cause he  ain't my uncle. How does "he/it" get half of the actors' hard earned money? That's crazy!
Taraji is a very smart, talented actress. She has maintained a admirable resume and not caught in the embattled side of the industry. Her emotions are real and raw. Her management team has an obligation to look out for her best interest. I think back to how the entire cast of "Friends" negotiated $1M/episode.  How are our tenure actors/actresses still being paid "minimum wage" in 2023?  They just protested for writers. Did they forget the African American actress?   #Payusourworth!🎬
Overseas, most places  don't have our movies showing in theaters. They portray our people in a negative way, but please know there are people there who really are ashamed how America treats black people.
WHO should be doing the paying though? Specifically for the Color Purple - should Ms. Oprah not be batting for her and co? I am so confused...why was she not recognized adequately here?
Man they need our money. We need to go back to plays. Let them black actors and actresses travel the country, we will be there. Shut Hollywood down!!!
Oprah is beyond wealthy and she could of overpaid her knowing her struggles.....in my opinion Oprah is no better than the rest of them
Her break thru was  baby boy  get that bread taraji i love you taraji dont stop acting taraji you do a great damn job on what u do
Why is she complaining about 5 million dollars when regular ppl live day to day not making nowhere near that. If ppl just live within there means the money would be enough
If I  have three mllion , lol. I’m tired of  paying my taxes  and Uncle Sam  I’m a millionaire .a couple times over . Cry me a river  Oh my god!
U a fighter T u gone make it
All the suckers in the comments make these crocodile tears even sweeter 😂😂😂
🙏🙏🙏🙏
She has every right to do what she wants to. She represents sooo many actors all over the industry.
Damn that you for the insight Taraji
GALE IS THE WORST to ME ….. I literally do not believe she cares for black people or there pain it’s weird
People on YouTube making more than her
Invest yo money and stop the bullshit crying been in hollywierd for years. You should have millions of dollars sitting in investments
AMEN! Well spoken Taraji! Talented and beautiful you are!
I understand
It was the IMMEDIATE SUPPORT from Danielle with the TOUCH on her arm for me!!!💖✨️🙏🏽🙌🏽✨️💖
Sorry TPH.
Take control in the name of God you have the Tyler perry moment
You are beautifully blessed it'ws going to be your best 🙏 money isn't the reward it's thet lost sheep you inspire to seeking your blessing Job did not get caught up in man. Man got caught up by Jobs Faith they were lost but Job was found before he was tempted to get lost
Her thoughts, feelings, experiences are so valid. #TarajiPHenson Love you Queen❤
I feel you Ms Taraji
I felt Taraji’s pain. She has done a lot of excellent work in the entertainment  industry and she hasn’t received all her accolades  as yet. I know she will but she feels defeated right now
I’m not discrediting Taraji, I sympathize for her on every level. However, it’s not only black women or black individuals that experience this. What they’re doing to Taraji, they’re doing to other women of color and white women. Again, nothing can compare to what Taraji is experiencing but her experience is the experience of millions of women.
MS Henson this beautiful black sister needs to be🎉❤😢 we love her ❤️🙏 that God peace 🕊️ joy and love in her life Amen
MS Henson this beautiful black sister needs to be🎉❤😢 we love her ❤️🙏 that God peace 🕊️ joy and love in her life Amen
This felt like a Religious and Therapy being one of the Chosen Few in that 12.11.23 Audience.  ✝️💜
Taraji is correct!  Her feelings needs to be validated. Here’s your flowers, lovely Black queen 🎉 🌹 🌸.   There needs to be a petition for higher pay for blacks in the business. Equal pay representation is warranted and needs to be demanded.
They always complaining about what Uncle Sam takes but promotes voting for Democrat
Join the club we work too and always broke so don’t feel sorry we all in same boat try playing Lotto
2023 almost 2024 and we still have systemic racism issues! Pay black women fairly Hollywood!
The devil is a liar so take control of the blessing god will put the blessing in line give God the the wheel and the spirit will give you the Tyler perry moment
Still didn’t address the pay and disrespect
She is a GOAT. Taraji we stand with you.
Get in the room with Arlan! Get in there! “We” are in fact worthy. We don’t need to cry over this industry.
🫂🙏🏾🫂🙏🏾🫂🙏🏾
The guy in the green suit just crapped over everything Taraji just said.  Dude, you should be paid what you're worth.  You can't live on a "job well done."  Her sacrifice is not going to inspire anyone. Nobody cares about that. When she's  gone, no one will remember. Give her her flowers, now!  Pay the woman!
Time to get our own.  These people don’t value or respect us.  KCUF MEHT!!!
More people should have stood with Monique she started the fight and a lot of people turned on her. ❤we have to stand up together when it's time🖤💃🏾💪🏾🙏🏽
Monique was saying this a long time ago.
It sems like the INDUSTRY, only wants Light Skinned Females, Brothers or People in Power, to Control the Industry in all aspects.  People like to play with our dark skinned Females, in this Industry. Everyone needs to speak up & break these Barriers down. Also, there should be no I do you a Favor, Now you owe me a Favor. Where are all of our Sisters & Brothers, who Claim they are for our equal pay as to our non counter parts & fighting for Justice? This Industry from TV, MUSIC , POLITICS &  AUDITIONS FOR CERTAIN PARTS HAVE ALWAYS, PIT US AGAINST EACH OTHER. GIVE PEOPLE WHAT THEY DESERVE & HOLLYWOOD OWN YOUR FAULTS & STOP WITH CRAP.  REMEMBER KARMA COMES BACK. TARAJI, YOU ARE A QUEEN WHO WEARS HER CROWN STRAIGHT.
Crying with you my sister and I’m angry with you…. Sister Taraji, you are AMAZING, EVERYONE OF MY SISTERS IN THE COLOR PURPLE, BLESSINGS ON ALL OF YOU!!!!❤️❤️❤️🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾!!!!😘😘😘😘
We as black people need to stop watching these kinds of movies that leave us more broken. Stop taking these roles. Why can’t we get more Black Panthers, not these distressing films. We need to be uplifted.
She deserves Better and is worth it
we get treated so bad and people think white supremacy isn't real but we want this  life
This is the same thing that happened to Terrence  Howard and many other  Black American actors they have been phased out by  British  Black actors and others they were warned about this and said nothing
Prince said you only get 20% of 80 % of what you make full time  work for part time pay
Well did Tyler Perry pay her well?  Did Oprah pay her well?
Refer back to the original breakdown of the ‘MATH’ that TLC broke down for the world during the Grammys. They sold thousands, and were broke. People think that Hollywood is gracious to everybody…..Think again, not everybody
They really glossed right over what she said and went back into promoting the film. And Gayle is so out of touch. Let's be real. She's best friends with a billionaire. She really couldn't relate to anything Taraji said. She had absolutely nothing to add to the conversation 🙃 Then the director is rambling about the impact of the movie? And being an example? 🥱
Take accountability. Save your money and move differently.
This is what Monique been saying for years and people said she is crazy. However, look at how many more are speaking up now. Look at the strike. She was never crazy she was hitting the nail on the head but no one was strong enough to speak out with her.
#DisneyDiva ❤
I’m sorry I can’t bring myself to feel bad for someone who’s racked in more money than an average person would make in a life time. We are all tired. Everyday  9-5 worker are paid pennies On millions and when have you ever seen Hollywood stand up for us??? Never
This is not fair! She's a major player in show business. Lady T  is on the same page as Glenn Close and even better. She's true to the art of acting and should be able to make the same amount of top pay!!
God, please protect her.
Same thing Monique was talking about over the pass 3 years...The pay for black women!...
TLC went through this ❤
All that sounds good what he's saying but they are not addressing the real problem..MONEY FOR THEIR SERVICES.
I hope she gets paid with The Color Purple
Monique has been saying this for years. I repeat, MONIQUE been saying this for years....
They treat our people like this all over the world 🌎. Don't know about you, but I'm tired of this.
All this shit is getting worse especially for BLACKS.. Forget them…. We do us.. I am sick of them. Where is the  Money she is due? Who is getting it? This reminds you of the election bullshit  we are going through now. Hollywood is worse.  Help is on the way now
So did she get paid for color purple
*I felt Taraji's pain in my soul. So beautiful and I have followed her for years. She* *owns every role she's ever played.* 💖
I just told my brother 1 week ago that Taraji was NOT happy ... I've been seeing it
You are more than an actor…..motivational speaker quotes: you master at everything you do. What can I do? You are so talented and capable of so much more than you know. When you reach out and maybe go parttime in acting and begin to be honored ny the people who follow. You.  I see you all the time. If someone said to me that uou are beginning something new your real passion and step out you will be very very successful. They will envy you and try to destroy you especially the white ones .  Their jealousy is stong but your passion and all you do and will so, will bring you millions to 100s of millions to billions.  Thats how talented you are.  YOU ARE BIGGER  THEM…..YOU FLY AND I DONT THINK YOU REALLY KNOW YOUR WORTH…… YOU WONT 9:10 NEED THEM. SOON……. WATCH GOD!!!!! JOSHUA 1:8 Isaiah 41:10 I am spiritual..not religious.. God is waiting on YOU NOT YOU WAITING ON GOD… WATCH GOD WORK.. THE DOOR YOU ATE GOING INTO NO MAN CAN SHUT… YOU ALREADY KNOW WHAT IT IS…… I know I am not on your level but if you want to talk to an real fan 850-661-0494 Candace Williams… THE BEST IS YET TO COME!!!❤❤  GOD IS WAITING ON YOU…..
Hollywood Does Not Value Black Women. They did not want to pay the white actors in general.
Greed!  She has millions already
Wow this shows y’all and she’s a well known actor been to Grammys earned rewards and she saying she is not even being payed enough treated right herself this is crazy
He's just running his mouth. She literally has millions of dollars in her bank account. I think it's safe to assume she's going to be Just fine. As long as she doesn't sell her soul to the devil's that run the movie industry, for bigger money. And in case y'all didn't know Oprah is a gatekeeper for those devils.
sad this world is built on exploitation
Take off for  a yr you need a break and we still going to love you
I know for a fact Morgan Freeman wasn’t getting paid shit lol
Get out of that wicked industry love. Taraji is a nice looking woman. Well said sis wish you the best.
This is the very thing that Mo'Nique was talking about.
Swear this is how I feel about being a black woman in trucking… Especially been a owner operator in the game.. Taraji keep your head up your truly an inspiration to us black women. I just pray our youth have it better. Even in 2023 going into 2024 it’s still modern day slavery. Take what they give you or what they let you do or take nothing at all…
Who did you vote for? 🗳 OMG These people, the Gayle Kings, the Taraji Hensons, the Hollywood types, have voted for many of the policies she's crying about, the policies that keep taxes high, that taxes personal income, the policies that say "rich people need to pay theiemr fair share" & now she's crying about it??? GTFOH
I think there’s inequality on different things. Teachers are absolutely underpaid. So I understand that there’s a gender bias and a race bias but in general terms it’s much bigger than that.
Taraji your awesome keep your head up the industry is hard but people don't see the behind the scenes
😢❤
Fell in love with her in the series person of interest. Lady you freeking rock. Since the I have been searching you out to watch what you are doing. You rock and are one of the best EVER.  Keep your head up and know people see you and the amazing work you do.
Just like us regular people. I appreciate her transparency. It allows me to see things in a bigger light
Talented people should not have to fight for their checks. Pay them what you pay, the other talented people. Common sense, make it fair.
Taxes: Wage Theft, for the Love of Money.
Taraji Do what Oprah and Tyler did start your own production
This hit me as a brown woman. I love Taraji. Your legacy is priceless, an incredible storyteller. I am cheering for you to heal and be given your fair check in all your work. I feel that, the despair. Needing to give 110% to be looked at as replaceable at work. You're a queen! ❤
We owe Mo'Nique a BIG APOLOGY!!! This confirms what she said 13 years ago!!! They're not doing right by us!!! Taraji, give Mo'Nique a call!!
What box office smash does she THINK she has been in that would allow her to command huge deals? No one is putting her name above the title on the marquee. SHE is not the draw of any project she is in. But yes....play the race and gender card to get the simps on your side.
Unmarried and old. Finally realizing thay money isn't the key to life. Having a husband and a family is more important lol.
I feel her pain. It’s in corporate America, and obviously in the arts.
Monique told y’all. It’s real.
Started in 1997, 75 acting credits. And she's still having a hard time. Shes been working hard too. That's messed up.
Wow things aren’t what it seems I thought they had good but it brought her tears 😢especially being  the industry that long.
African American culture more than translates overseas (from Hip Hop to K-Pop, from sports to fashion and the listen never ends) the point is that if it is given a chance to translate overseas then the terms of engagement with Black cultural producers here in the US changes.   Their project has always been to use our entertainment as a form of containment.
I feel this.
Monique said this 5 years ago, in this same order...
Should've supported Monique
We love Taraji❤I definitely feel where you coming from I’m not an actor but I get up everyday to go care for my patients in these companies don’t want to you shit they want you to work for pennies when I have children to send of to college I definitely understand your frustration it’s not fair
I have heard her talk about faith preach now is the time to apply it to herself dig deep come up fighting this is coming from a place of love!
You are Beautiful and Extremely talented! Do Not Ever forget that! Be Encouraged and continue to lean on and trust God! If you call on Jesus, he will answer 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾. I 🙏🏾 that you continue to be the Blessed and magnificent actress that you are! Think about taking a break and ask God for direction. You will be greatly missed, should you decide to stop 🛑 acting! 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾💙🤗❤️💓💙🔥🔥🔥🔥
1 1:40 :05 ❤
This is not about pay she is battling something else turn it over to Jesus pray about it this was suppose to be a moment for you and your peers the only way someone can break your soul is if you turn away from God and his word every thing does not have to be about you let others have their moments!
More then one America.
It's those terrible contracts.  Hustle and Flow movie won an Oscar and her co-star main character,  Terrence Howard only made like $12k dollars and he wrote the hit song. 😢
She didnt say thank you to the tissue person! I am sorry I notice these little things in people's personalities it speaks a lot about them.
Oh now yall wanna listen. Nobody was speaking this loud when Monique took a stance by her dam self years ago. Taraji shut up and stop all this dam crying. Should have got on the train years ago when Monique was advocating for you now you right here in the same situation saying the same thing but no you were to busy stuck up Tyler Perry ass that you couldn’t see that they were doing you with no grease. Hopefully just hopefully this movie is your just do!! Can’t say the same about Monique she had to deal with a set back and fight her way back for what she already deserved
Black America we need our own
I want to give her a hug! I’ve been watching her for her entire career and she is one of my favorite actresses. 🌹❤️
She is not quitting  at all
Monique,  Terence Howard,  Viola all were saying the reality. I see how Taraji is explaining the entertainment industry.  I agree the money just isn't the right amount
This is disheartening 😢
Good leave
BUT THIS IS WHAT MONIQUE WAS SAYING!!!!😢😢
Taraji  needs to refocus and stop being over exposed. It will come in time Refocus!
This is so sad. I felt your pain. She is such an awesome actress and others try to berate her light and her talent. So awful we still live in a time we still have to fight to show we are as good as what we do as the other races of people. I applauded her fir standing up for herself but still trying to help others coming behind her. God give her strength .
Good who fuckin cares
The only feel empathy when it happens to them! We regular black ppl been asking them to Allie with us as a whole for years. All the while they were shopping, fronting. All the darkness is coming to light 💡.
She’s not quitting no one wants to hire her cause she’s not a good actor
Us black people have to stick together to make things happen for us and to get what we deserve
All do respect I don’t give a damn about millionaires crying over shit us reg folks gave to deal with on a real life scale.
I don't know what to say about the payment in Hollywood. But I believe they wasted a bunch of money remaking The Color Purple They should have chosen something less sad and depressing. Something less oppressive.
Mo'nique, Viola Davis, now Taraji. Keep talking about it.
Team is getting 30% 😱and Taxes taking a little over 30% while Accountant is probably stealing 15% 17% and claiming its being taken by Taxes,Shes definitely getting screwed over especially since her Team can’t find her a better Deal while taking 30% while they got her overworking for crumbs
Girl, tell it… so true… man!!!
We feel you, Sister!! Across every industry. What saddens me more is when your own ppl sometimes don’t see your value and want to pay you peanuts. And don’t speak up and advocate for yourself. Now you are the angry Black woman. No, damn it! What you hear here is frustration and exhaustion on so many levels. Run her her money! We are tired of fighting. So brave of you, TPH! HUGS, Queen!!❤️❤️❤️🙏🏽
cringe
I feel so much  empathy for Taraji, because I know exactly how it feels to be unappreciated, unacknowledged and underpaid for all the hard work and effort you put into your work. Please don't quit Taraji, because if you do the haters will win. You are a very talented actress and your fans very much so appreciate the gift you share with us through your work!!!
The unfortunate story of black women in most industries. 😢
Same thing in the corporate world blacks do the hardest work and the less pay especially in customer service
This is what the strike was really about. You shouldn’t have to fight so hard just to express yourself creatively. The patriarchy doesn’t know how to quantify the value of creative expression because it comes from the heart and the soul. You cannot put an adequate price on it and so they just figure they won’t pay at all because “it came from the heart.” It’s time for a revolution for artists across the country ❤
Terrence Howard got paid $12K for Hustle and Flow and $6K for the Movie Crash so it seems like the Show Empire was one of their biggest pay because they got paid $150k or more per Episode which is more then they made off 1 Movie but at the end T Howard starting getting paid from $125K and Topped out at $325K per Episode and it possible it went that high during the last Season but Teraj Team probably didn’t renegotiate because it stayed at $150k an Episode for her
LEAVE! Black folks bailed Hollywood out in the 70’! LEAVE! Let them fail, again. Periodt!
Monique v2 ❤Kanye
Mo been trying to tell y’all and they working with a powerful wealthy lady
But yet the movies that make it to the screen are garbage 🗑.
All the “mmmmmm’s” and whispers behind her are driving me crazy….  But she’s right. The math ain’t math’n
I feel her pain ❤ The people have to support them!!!
Man I feel her I wish I was there I would have crying with her
She definitely got screwed over for the Movies she has done especially the Color Purple,she asked for $500K they disagreed so they agreed on $150K and shes one of the lead Actress thats also on the Cover but to be honest I wouldn’t be surprised if the Movie flopped because the demographic for The Color Purple are more old People in their 50’s and most Female 😬I hope Im wrong and Im not saying a Female in 30’s won’t watch that Movie but most People are dodging Movie Theaters to watch Movie/Tv Streaming Apps instead
This Is How Everyone Should Fill Going To Work. No Matter What The Job Is.
Who is not tired of this shit hole called life? Nobody Cares, people say they are sad when someone dies I say congratulations you made it out.
Is this for all people ?
Nobody didn't listen to Monique when she said this industry has a problem. WOW!!!!
What is Whoopi going to say now? Monique and Taraji keep talking...
There must be some truth to that....there are too many celebs saying this same stuff
This vas real 😢
She need her Empire look BACK! She lookin kinda ragged.
0:44 "That Math Ain't Mathin'." Taraji explains it even further. 1:02 "Such n such made $10M. That didn't make it to their account. Know that, off the top, Uncle Sam is getting 50%." Now it's down to $5M. 1:15 "Your team is getting 30%, off  of what you gross. Not after what Uncle Sam took. Now do the math."
Whoever owns the rights to this production of color purple needs to cut that bonus check!! Who owns the rights? Who can cut the check?
That “I’m just tired” broke my heart. I feel her sentiments. I hopes she find peace with the industry. It isn’t for the faint of heart.❤️
That's most of America. ALL of us are in the same boat!!!
🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
Lol try working a normal job then.
Sis you guys still dont get it! You is black baby and this world is ran by massa! They aint never gonna allow you to get much and if you do they will take it from you!  Job 9:24 [24]The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth the faces of the judges thereof; if not, where, and who is he?
We see you ❤❤❤
The nerve...
OK Director Director.. I like you and all….Did you have to make your moment about you in the end? Huuuuhhhhh!!
I never knew actors go through this just like regular working people bust your behind and get nothing so sad
BUT WHEN MONIQUE ASKED YALL TO STAND WITH HER YALL WAS QUIET AF‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️
I am so over our sisters crying over their treatment.....enough is enough.
Taraji, Terrence Howard, Jennifer Lopez…..people tired of being under appreciated in Hollywood
Micah 2:10 KJV Arise ye, and depart; for this is not your rest: because it is polluted, it shall destroy you, even with a sore destruction.
I’ve always liked her as an actor. Unfortunately, you’re not going to catch too much sympathy because we all struggling. It is truly unfortunate though.
The lady in yellow is throwing up one of the illuminati signs.
Gayle said not a word
My sister you are an AMAZING Actress who has opened doors.  I’m glad the industry didn’t steal your soul. When something doesn’t make you happy anymore it is time to give it up. I wish you much success & happiness 😍😍
I SUPPORT YOU TARAJI!!
Unfortunately, she's working with Oprah's this go round and we all know oprah rarely hires or pay black people fairly.😮
Where were the actresses When Monique was fed up.
Monique told y’all long time ago no one defended her you snubbed your noses at her hollyweird is going down now everyone wants a pity party girl bye😂😂😂😂
Taraji has issues with HERSELF, much bigger than the industry issues. Ok, that's not a sin, good lick to her. But she (and others) who looooove to couch their flight as some great larger fight for "justice" or "the next generation," please, stop. Just stop the martyr bit. Your fight is 99% for YOURSELF, your own fulfillment. Again, that's fine. Just call it like it is.
Where was her voice when Monique was left to stand alone regarding this issue? Whatever? Bye Felicia 👋🏽
Can we  just say BLACK PPLE IN GENERAL
Who is the interviewer?
Ase!!!
I don't know why anyone would expect folks who do not look like them, to value them more than they value themselves as whole.
The Color Purple, did Oprah pay 💰 well 🤔?
She’s the only reason I want to act 😥
To be fair, she won't be missed. Everyone is replaceable. If she's a "working performer," she's lucky to be so and should stay in the business.
All l know is yall need to pay this women her worth!!!
Taraji, I want you to know that I appreciate you, I see you. I'm not in entertainment, but I have experienced a tremendous amount of discrimination in my field. I feel your pain. Sending prayers for healing and prosperity your way. 🙏🙏🙏❤
Amen my brother talk on it brother talk on it
I totally understand, even though I'm no where near the status of this beautiful Queen but when you work hard all your life you get to this point no matter what field you work in. She's definitely tired. She's at the top of her game. Pay her!
Love you Taraji ♥️ You’re so beautifully honest. You need to be compensated at the top amount. You sis, are phenomenal. Never can be quantified. Don’t let them break your spirit. 🙏🏾🫶🏾
She should have funds to be retired by now! I watched her grow and she left her hometown on faith with her son and now she going through this. I wish I could help her financially so she can rest ❤
Glad she spoke up and out.
Boo hooo
Praying fore you my sister and brother in the industry 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽❤️❤️❤️
Hey Oprah Winfrey talk to YOUR PEOPLE BIG BOSS  BILLIONAIRE....parading around in purple is not making the difference needed for THIS PHENOMENAL ACTOR to not consider QUITTING because she's TIRED of being OUT CASTED by a historically white washed industry. Films are again looking like Turner Movie Classics NO BLACKS ANYWHERE. 😢
I understand where she's coming from why not start your own production everyone that. They're being underpaid start their own production company write some movies do some Broadway plays just don't keep yourself in one box if you feel as though these people is playing you I know she have a hair clear line that she started but take a step back from acting...
We feel ya...and we ❤u
I want to know who’s writing the paychecks.  Does Oprah have any involvement in the pay grade-just asking? I know the better the movie does in ticket sales, the more the actors and those involved get paid; however, the hire on rate must be established in the beginning-right?
Her acting in hidden figures is Oscar winning/worthy. It makes ZERO sense how she is still fighting to be paid correctly after YEARS of stellar work and credibility. Taraji is a name that brings people to the theatre/TV. What she said about fighting for the next gen and being tired is very sad.
Who is she talking about because I know she's in a new movie color purple the up-to-date version supposed to be what she didn't get paid properly I'm lost
I appreciate her realness.
"The math ain't mathing". Speaks volumes!!
She needs to host a show.
Taraji has me crying and I am not even in the spotlight but face this similar type of racism in what I do too. As Black people we will never get our dues.
prob bc she isn't a star.... she isn't Angelina Jolie.
She is a Brilliant actress ❤
I thought the thumbnail was clickbait but geesh, I wasnt expecting Tariji to get this raw. ❤  People get mad when I tell them Networth/Profit/Revenue is not the same as cold hard cash in the bank. Your favorite artists/actors are struggling. Richer than us, yes, but not as rich as you think.
Who's taking a SiriusXM interview serious? And who even is this actor? lul!
We have a government problem in this country it is setup to take your money, 50% off the top is complete insanity, it’s everywhere in this country.  We the people have to stop it
@3:11 got that conversation back on the movie quick!!!
Y’all still going to go see that movie at the box office too.
Yes, Sister, speak it....
Nobody had Monique back tho
The disparities between the pay white actors get and black actors for the same roles is insane
The Education of Entertaining always stated that Actors are likened to Court Jesters which never included a whole lot of money. As a student at HSPVA, although I aided in putting Houston on the map, I digressed to My love for Math as a foundation. I use My talents to encourage and entertain My Husband and Children which was a better return on investment.
we love you Taraji
I feel for Taraji. I hope she does pull through and really find a way. God is looking down on her.
When you've got a soul your always going to work twice as hard to get to the top. IF you make it and not let the devil break you down along the way.
Leave! Free yourself and Do your own thing! ❤ Happy 😊 is more important!
She favors Janet Jackson
Thank you Taraji!!  Speak the truth baby!
I thought being an actress was one of the coolest things…hard work but it will pay off. I guess not. Sad.
This hurt my heart to hear her pain. 🥺
Hopefully big wigs like "oprah & gayle" and many more can do more to provide a solution.   Gotta choose right...yea.
On the real…Equal pay in all industries should be THE LAW! I’m sick and tired of differences in treatment, pay, and benefits based on gender, and or race.
They are trying to make you stop go to Court and deman more money
She speaks for all of us who work hard at our craft and get a fraction of the economics. We have to diversify because she is right, it will steal your soul and energy. You only feel her tears if you’ve been through it. Brave times
yall still think monique crazy
When Mo’Nique said it, nobody wanted to listen. Y’all should’ve stood by your sister !
WE get it....Everyday BLACK ppl ESPECIALLY BLACK WOMEN working a 40 hour week & get less than that..Living pay check to pay check...Oh But GOD WHO gives us true value DETERMINES our worth and supersedes and increases our biggest imaginations and dreams...our blueprints are already predetermined we are just going through the motion
I’m confused, is she saying Oprah didn’t pay her enough for color purple??
Why is you setting on stage crying when you worth about 12 millions are more  and walking around with designer bags , clothes, 👠 when we got families who lost their homes, car, homeless and sleeping on the streets cause they don't have any place to lay their heads cause they don't have nothing are any foods so you should be the last person to be mourning SMH !!!!!
Y’all are saying you felt this… how?? I guarantee she has very expensive stuff- how can you compare yourself to her? We are barely surviving- I have so money health issues- I can’t work?? My husband makes maybe 45,000 a year and she gets double that per episode.. live with your means. My husband and my dad ( when he was alive) they worked their asses off. This is so disgusting to me- we are considered middle class 10 years ago his income would’ve been fine but because the President( the one you guys voted for) is fucking us up.. I do not feel sorry for anyone in the entertainment industry and sports. It’s disgusting that they cry- see if she would give you guys money to help.. there’s people that have no insurance and die every single day because they have nothing. I can’t even get medicaid because my husband makes too much money hahhaha ok. I have uterine and ovarian cancer.. I have type 2 diabetes.. I have thyroid issues… I have arthritis.. I have fibromyalgia.. I have several hernias that get strangled in with my colon- which I can die from..I have major depressive disorder and anxiety- I have so many fuckin issues - if my husband made 6 figures a year we would be set and here you all are saying you understand her- what a joke!! You guys are trippin lol
Well, Kanye told us who are the executives of Hollygay or Gaywood…Those so-called ######
It’s not only in the movie industry it’s in all industries black women get lower salaries and more entry level positions than others
Lord Bless her😢❤. To all those laughing at her pain. Remember that when ur trial and tribulations come. Karma is real
It’s all industries when you look like Taraji
Yes, we have to other things to supplement what you are doing!
Why is Monique voice in my head? This is what she went through...
When I found out that she was not going to be nominated for a Golden globe for this movie, all I could do was shake my head. Bad enough for that fabulous performance she did in hidden figures, she didn't get the nominations she should have gotten for best actress, because frankly, she should have won all of them, let alone been nominated. Bad enough she hasn't been properly acknowledged for quite a few excellent works she has done on both television, and in film. But the industry has still seemed to refuse to give this women the proper flowers she has been had earned, and yeah, that can be discouraging. I would hate to see her quit acting, but having watched her career, and knowing that she has not been getting the accolades, or compensation, that she deserves, I would definitely understand. This woman has worked too hard, and she has been too good at what she does for the industry to still be sitting on her so much, and offering her so little. It hasn't made any sense.
Wow, this is the real deal about Hollywood!   Now, people are feeling what Monique has been talking about all along in regards to blacks not getting the pay that white actors get in Hollywood.
Thats what Auntee Monique was saying and was blackballed for.
Taraji you are so Amazing!!! Never Forget That!!!! You have come Toooo Farrrr!!  Bigggg Huggs and Keep Shining!! ❤💗❤We See You and Love What you Add to the Industry❤❤❤💪🙏
Monique and Nia long said it years ago black actresses don't get paid enoygh compare to white actresses. Remeber when Netflix offered Monique $500,000 and gave the white comedian $13,000,000. That is $12,500,000 difference which is crazy.
Any single income household in America will face economic challenges in America unless you’re one the top 10% earners. Regardless of the industry you’re in you’re going to have secure roommates to split expenses to lighten the economic burden regardless of your gender unless you’re a top 10% earner. You can’t sustain a previous standard of living when your income declines and facing record breaking inflation.  It’s very simple math which proves unsustainable. 🤷🏾‍♂️
i look forward to the day i can make millions & complain about needing more millions. live within you means & you'll be alright. simple format. & if you don't like your job/career, then quit. nobody's holding you hostage at it. people out here living check to check, get real.
Ohh booohoo try working as a Nurse, Cleaning Personal, Delivery, Server etc.
Monique was RIGHT 13-14 years who and many of yall clowned and chastised her, so the fact this is an Oprah Production too is so ironic.
Taraji needs to ask Beyonce for advice. Bey gets her money! 💰
That Director is gaslighting, shucking and jiving. Run Taraji her money! Accolades and "flowers" don't pay the bills.
It doesn’t help that Oprah went around and saying that the executives wanted Beyoncé or Rhianna for her role! Neither one of them can SING let alone ACT! 😂 Oprah isn’t Black folks friends
😢😢❤❤
You are such a  good actress taraji, if this is what you love doing, then keep doing what you love doing, and break into producing movies yourself, and you can become what Tyler Perry has become. You are a great actress, and I can tell you put everything into your acting.❤We love you! Keep the faith!
It angers me to hear her say this. Where were people when Monique was saying the same thing a few years ago? Monique was on an island by herself, black listed and unsupported by many of her industry peers. Monique was not as gracious.... Actually I take that back. Monique a few years ago was saying the same thing graciously. It upsets me because instead of black people uniting together to be treated with fairness in situations like this often it's often with conditions. Who is speaking out and if they are supported by people who are considered elite in the industry? Will this affect me if I support this black listed person who is speaking the truth. Taraji and many others who silently complain should have been standing and supporting Monique. This is the same thing Monique was speaking about. People just didn't like the messenger.  A fight...a stand for fair treatment in anything can really be won if people stop thinking of only self and realize change for the better can happen if we unite despite who is giving the message.😮
If the money increase the product decreases and no one wants to sell out. I pray Black people do more  if it's not worth the labor and testimony.
I don’t want her to quit but I don’t blame her. The fact her quote hasn’t changed since 2018 is sad. She deserves more, I love her work🫶
I Prayed 🙏 that Taraji always have the Peace that Surpasses  all Inderstanding. Also , she not only gets more work & pay for her Craft, because she is so talented. she actually Deserves it.  Bless You 😊 & Happy Holiday's.
As far as the director/producers comments about "faith" and the legacy you're leaving behind - what is wrong with doing all that AND getting PAID CORRECTLY for doing so!? He listened to everything TARAJI P. HENSON said and basically responded "choose whether you wish to be "paid correctly" or leave a so called "legacy". He must be oblivious to the fact there is A LEGACY being left behind and its the legacy of them taking OUR WORK and NOT "paying us correctly" for it!! Taking our ideas and what we create and taking "OWNERSHIP" of it!! And we have an entire history in this business to PROVE IT!! So, at what point is ENOUGH ENOUGH? How long do you have to "wear your ass out" running here and running there, producing HITS but recieving CRUMBS?  No wonder TARAJI "tired" I'm tired just "hearing" the bull. SHE RIGHT!!!! MONIQUE WAS RIGHT!! The question is - ARE THERE ANY OTHERS WHO ARE TIRED OF PLAYING ALONG WITH THE BULL SHIT WHO WILL CALL IT EXACTLY WHAT IT IS: SLAVERY BY ANOTHER NAME!!  But if they did that - how would they eat! Because we know what happens when you begin to TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT IT. You won't work - which means you won't eat!! And ain't a got damn "fan" gonna support them and their bills. Because fans love you while you "hot" - not when you're NOT! So, "here we are" and "the beat goes on". SMH...
Don’t let it break your soul
This is heartbreaking from such a veteran actress who is extremely talented.  😢 I pray she doesn't quit.
When I tell u the lady from orange is the new black is so shook
It’s telling us that black women in Hollywood working for 20 plus years, and getting paid LESS THAN. Systematic racism is the devil in disguise. Speak on  Ms. Taraji. The enemy loves secrets….put it out there black ppl.🙏🏾🦋
I love that Taraji shared her needs and wants. I appreciate the way the director ministered to Taraji’s hurt. The fact that she has a ministry assignment which by far will take care of her. Taraji God bless your ministry! 🙏🏾
Initially, I thought, 'Why is she being so dramatic?' Then when she started speaking, I realized she has every right to be upset. There are so many mediocre actresses (Jennifer Aniston) making millions more than quality actresses (Alfre Woodard, the very great Lyn Winfield, etc.).  Left Eye of TLC broke down how TLC could be broke after generating MILLIONS. It sounded eerily similar to what Taraji said.
We are all tired of working and living paycheck to paycheck……
Honey you are not getting any money !!! Didn’t you see what happened to Mo’Nique!!! Homeboy gaslighting you!!! Oprah keeping y’all oppressed!! She building a bunker in Hawaii!! You , Fantasia her meal ticket to get there!!! Come on Taraji!!! Don’t let no person make a fool out of you!!
I understand the point he was trying to make. However, we must not overlook T entire point. Black women and men in Hollywood should be paid fairly and not forced to settle for less than what they are worth.
😂😂 girl bye! People accepting money for jobs and then crying about it is old. Po is me.
Taraji has a point but thats the profession she chose. When an actress hits 50 thats pretty much it. Its even worse if you're a Black actress. There are a few exceptions like Viola Davis
Hollywood gotta stop it! Taraji is a great actress and deserves her coins. Women need to get paid their fair share. Taraji was on so many hit shows and movies. She is a phenomenal actress. Love you Taraji ❤.
Did he not hear her say that she’s tired of fighting….he’s talking a lot but not really saying anything substantial
Taraji is an exceptional and proliphic and amazing actress. A treasure that we can't loose. Please Stay.
I love that he sounds Viola Davis.
But nobody wanted to back Monique
Love ya Taraji. Wow🤎🙌🙏
Naomi Campbell had the same problem modeling. Her agency offered her$75,000 while her white counterparts were making millions. She rejected there offer and the agency launched a smear   campaign against her. Taraji quit her TV show, Person of Interest for the same disrespect!
What is Viola getting per movie? I would get with her and seek advice on how to move in this space, Viola been around this industry forever.❤
Smh... I wish I could bring home 5 million. Hell a million... I wish I had that opportunity... She crying cause it's not enough... Smh damn
I feel and understand Taraji completely! It's from all angles of work and life that Black Americans face Globally and in the US. It sickening how the people of other races still view us, in our culture, work, and life, and they get to determine "how much we are worth" in an essence. To think we are still just shy 80+ years of segregation and racism, and 400+ from slavery. We still have so much WORK TO DO as a PEOPLE! That's why it pisses me so bad when someone is quick to say "its not about race" "why you had to bring race into it"....ITS ALL ABOUT RACE!
So sad, smh  Monique was saying this many years ago and people referred to her as an angry, ungrateful black women 😢😢
This director is filled with empathy and love that call only come from God
This whole world is tired and over ….. these are the last days huntyyy!!!!!! Don’t work yourself for this world!
The issues is Taxes. They are stealing everyone’s money and doing none of the work. This government!!! Taxes are illegal yet America made it legal
At this point Taraji P. Henson from a business POV she needs to go the Tyler Perry or Reese Winterspoon route and open up her own production company and use her platform to market the projects and earn money from the IP, distribution, etc. Just being talent is not lucrative plus she needs to keep her overhead low and take that money to reinvest into other businesses not non-profits, respectfully.
i remember when Viola Davis saying this! she said she has the same career as Meryl Streep, Julliane Moore but she doesn't get half of what they are paid
Nobody spoke up for Monique either! I just haven't figured out why anyone would want to be an entertainer at this point. They all broke.. you can literally grind for 150 k and live better and freer than them..
Can see pain and hurt in her face she is brilliant and beautiful and will find her space
So Oprah didn't pay them right on The Color Purple? They should all be rich working with Oprah!!!
I just love her . She deserves so much better . Hate seeing her cry but she is  letting out her true feelings.
She *STILL* getting paid *LESS* They just *treat* her like she's *DSMISSED*
God’s gotta blessing with yawl’s name on it 🥰🙏🏾🥰!
Whew!!! Sister I truly understand and shed tears with you. We are so talented yet so dismissed and treated unfairly. It must stop. It has to stop.
The entertainment industry has been exposed for the evil, inhumane, racist, misogynistic industry that it truly is, be it film or music and it is heartbreaking to learn the horrific things that artists have to endure to become great in the various parts of the industry! I am so disappointed in the insider info that is now being exposed about the industry and the players in the game, the extent that the masters of the game will go to, with power gained and their use of that power hung over the new folk or those who trying trying to rise in status, it is sickening to learn that sex is used to control or maintain power. 😫😖😡
We have to keep fighting for our ppl. If you haven’t already but your tickets let’s make this movie big as possible
Don't you dare Taraji P. quit/stop acting because that will not solve the discrepancies that exist. But you can take action, teach the next generatiion and then become a survivor.
love you Taraji. Thanks for telling the truth. It also happens in broadcasting.
This is disgusting really .. I was thinking Taraji had already reached Tyler Perrys financial status if not near the amount of films this icon has done..Hollywood disgusts me really like wtf and all the black actors in Hollywood are just looking at this injustice going on ???? fyi Terrence Howard got paid only 1200$ for Hustle & Flow ???? Nah this is theft
People work harder then you for pennies so I don’t feel sorry for you should know how to invest so you don’t have to pay so many taxes. Who said life was fair
We need you Taraji❤️🌻
We love you Taraji ❤
This breaks my heart. Just imagine we are never given what what should have due to our skin. And the ones that have made it besides Tyler Perry don’t think they should put something together to make it better. Other people are not going to fix us because it’s intentionally done. I know the taxes hitting . We came so far but still behind in the industry. We are watching each other only now so why she can’t get paid. Monique been talking about this. It’s takes a village of us 👨🏾👵🏿👩🏾‍🦱👨🏿‍🦰🧔🏾the ones in the industry that came along time ago. Oprah etc. Dang on shame🤬
I love Taraji i really felt her
Name 1 movie she made that did real numbers. Shes not a draw as the main star
How can we get in touch with Taraji...Your voice and pain collectively as black women feel U deeply... let's talk solutions
I think they are too young to realize what she saying. It’s not about flowers or praise. It’s the money power respect as lil Kim would say !   As black people we are not taught how and when to negotiate and we don’t have enough avenues that are funded by us to offset the racism and prejudice we experience
CREATE YOUR OWN
Well shyt, you made 2 million on the 10 million. Then got tax write-offs on your employees and vendor expenses. Out the 2 million, take the 300k loan to start a new McDonald's location. Next year, do the same. Plus a house in a suburb some darn where. Now you have some serious passive income rolling in.  What am I not getting here.. am I supposed to have sympathy for a upper middle aged lady that's bring home 2 million after tax and expenses?  It would take the average person 40 years to earn 2 million dollars. Stop them crocodile 🐊 tears..
Taraji i think its time to produce your own production company its not fair when it comes to black ppl especially black woman in the usa
How old is this video?
They deserves  every penny❤❤❤
The REAPING IS COMING!!!🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
Taja don't don't give up you're my favorite actress God got something installed for you got a lot of haters but notice you're the best notice you're a great actress everything going to be alright God bless you and your family don't give up
If Taraji does quit acting I’ll be devastated. Taraji is OURS just like Angela Bassett, Regina King, Regina Hall and Viola Davis is. They are the culture as far as black women are concerned. We need to continue to shower Taraji with love and praise because she’s given us moments that generations to come will never forget.
Monique said it, how many years ago?  So sad to hear.
Taraji P. Henson is Very 🎁 Gifted in the Arts. I also felt like 😢 crying for Taraji. The Entertainment business can be very "CUT-THROAT". Taraji  GOD ÂGÂPÉ ❤️ LOVES you and so do I. 🙏❤️
❤❤prayers. You are amazing. You are enough 🎉🎉You never know what people are going through
Girl get those coins💯💯💯💯
Great actress but lets not pretend she is doing triple a movies. Should she get paid more yes but lets not start doing friends money when you arent there yet.
Taraji please don’t quit, we love you❤❤❤❤
Damn, she got me crying!!!!! Got me side eyeing wanting to be an actress when I was younger.
We don’t translate over seas yet everyone is acting black ???? It’s crazy
I hear you Tarsaji. I hate that we have to have this great director to have to be the "Great Appeaser' because of well you know. We love Taraji. She is an A List but she like treated like nothing.
My heart felt every word from Taraji P. Hensen. Our people are not given the same respect as White actresses or actors. I've never heard Julia Roberts fight like this, and I love Julia Roberts as an actress. Blessings to them all 🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🥺🥺🥺
She also crying because she sold her soul for movies and still struggling
Blacks should be doing well overseas. Our music and hairstyles are, so why not the movies? These directors and producers are lying..
Monique has been talking about this n fighting this fight for the ones that come after her BUT no one wanted to stand with her. Now they feeling it. It would be so awesome if they could come together. There's power in numbers.
😢I pray every thing gets better for you and all the others Taraj. You are a beautiful and great actress!!!🌹🌹👏👏🙏👍🙌💔💕
I can only imagine her feelings. When you see the same folks ALWAYS getting the jobs and money to go with it. Like why couldn't she (or any other black female)  have been the lead in The Devil Wears Prada or Mr. and Mrs. Smith (examples)
You’re not getting paid what you’re worth black women because God wants you in line with his word. Helping our communities, nursing, teaching, and being attorneys etc. not in the devils filthy pool (Hollywood)… They can’t pay you enough to be fake in front of a camera but God can give you grace and mercy to help his people and you’ll be happy doing it! I love you always.
The Director is not a Descendant of American Chattel Slavery. This is what happens when we include outsiders others in our discussions just cause they have the same melanin and not our history. He should never have been chosen to direct the film.
I’m sorry. Isn’t that every small business in America? Your name is a brand we all suffer from not getting what we deserve for the prejudice in the world. The fact that u have enough to even say retire, is a blessing.  The Dude had much more substance to the real issue.
But once we build our own stuff, for black woman, they wanna come and infiltrate. Cant win for nothing.
She is  so so so rite!!!!! I  understand  we LOVE YOU HONEY; IM A PCA LOVE WHAT DO. I HAVE NO DAYS OFF THEY DONT PAY ENOUGH
Everyone make fun of Monique but this stuff is real in every industry..I just do the best I can to keep my head up..but these are facts that made me crack my tough strong black woman shell and cry too Taraji
That’s what one of the members from TLC said
This is the same thing Monique has been saying, same thing Kanye been saying and others. Them industry people not gonna pay them right or do them right. They have to have their own everything
Get rid of that big house and big bills… just get enough
Monique said this years ago. I feel for sis. I love Tarji thank u for being vulnerable and letting it be known again
I love this!!!
Wow.   This is sad.
It’s hard out here for a pimp. But seriously, she deserves it all and I hope people quit hollering DEI and start showing up.
You're supposed to promote the movie, it's unprofessional to use the promotion to cry about your pay. This might get sympathy from people online who won't pay to see your movies but it isn't going to endear you to the general audience nor make Hollywood producers think you deserve extra pay.   Actors in Hollywood get paid according to how many people they attract to watch their products. That's why The Rock, Kevin Hart, Ryan Reynolds etc are so careful about how they present themselves publicly, they know to maximise their pay, they need to appeal to the broadest audience.   Many people are facing enormous financial challenges  right now, they can't afford housing, medical care, heating their homes etc and this woman is crying because she has to pay tax and her publicist on her millions.
Check out the photos of 🙈🙊🙉 them in  essence magazine tell me what you think and ther photo expression and this is before the promotion tour
She’s Full Of It! She Has All The Money In The World!
"steal your soul"?...that was sold in order to get put on.
where are the tears at though? 🤔🙄
When writing scripts i guess it wont matter how authentic n original it is if u black.. im a keep writing tho
I’m disgusted by the industry. This woman deserves fair pay.
🎼You can't win child. You can't break even and you can't get out of the game. 🤔🙄🤡🎭😭
What about producers giving a gratuity to actors 🙉🙊🙈
She is an outstanding Oscar nominated actress who really stayed on Empire to long. After the first 2 to 3 seasons downhill. To good of an actress for that.
Yes, I identify with what Taraji is saying...This happens to educators as well...When you're exceptionally good,  & only one or two look like you,  you're consistently used to make "them" look good, but you are never rewarded for your greatness...All the while, those less deserving receive  awards & benefits, while you continue to work twice as hard & are never appreciated.
She would not be commanding big money until after Benjamin button . Since then she did a lot of low budget movies . Low budget movies equal low pay . Maybe actors start negotiate bonuses from box office numbers .
Wow! This is crafty and hurtful.
She needs to get with Monique and Viola and they can amplify each others voices.
The African director seems insincere, he's sounds like he's talking a whole bunch of fluff.You can see its not resonating.
She still getting paid big money. Sounds like she should get rid of her “team”
This made me sick to watch. This woman has worked her butt off and to be on the couch fighting for her worth at this stage in the business is crazy!!!!!
Didn’t Monique say this years ago…. Distinctively I remember when she wanted Netflix to do so…..but she stood talk and I’m proud of that!!!!!  I pray that Taraji keeps going ❤
The industry can be a dam Beast
It tells me u need a  better layer and  business agent Ma..
Please do not quit-We all understand and feel your pain for this maltreatment in pay . This is a nonending thread of injustice that runs across the many different fabrics and different professions. Try hard to remember harriet tubman , sachel page, jackie robinson all standing behind you for support-you are creating a  excellent path just in doing your job with excellence.  Emerson said its okay to drop Anchor to rest as long as you dont stay! We cherish you, respect you and are so thankful for you just showing up. Draw on our strength you are a pioneer.Thank you so much. Maya Angelo said "still I rise". Please, get up ! We have a standing ovation for you. ❤😊
Yessss! This!
🙏🏽 Continuous Blessings  My Divine Blessed Sister's  & Brother. (((TARAJI YOU ARE EXTREMELY AMAZING)))) What God Has For You. It Is For You ✝️🕊🙏🏽
I completely understand. Although I’m not in the film industry I am a Black woman living in the U.S. and just before I stopped working I felt demoralized by the companies that I worked for.  I was asked to train all of the new people because “everyone you train does well” but I’m not good enough to be a manager. I feel like I was taken advantage of my whole life.  I had to work through and determine that my worth is not dependent on the value given me by those I worked for. I have to know my value. My coworkers appreciated me they came to me they acknowledged my value everywhere I went. It has to be enough. It’s not me it’s them!
a harsh reality.
shoot i dont blame you taraji.!
Well she can focus on music for a change. Taraj can sing.
🗣I feel that treatment still may not be equal pay or equal lots ..Or amenities from how they said they treated Queen Latifah & tha Living single set versus tha Friends set or what Terrance Howard said He got paid on Hustle & slow over tha voice of Dj on tha songs. It's going hurdles & it's going to be racism systematic on every level because people are two faced. But it boil down to paying bills..thats why She shedding them tears when you live outside your means. You roccin' Diamonds & Crying cut it Out. Money So tite right now .. And it's tha holidays ..I don't feel that
They want us to give up because we're tired. Close ranks and lift each other up!! Keep going.
If the math ain't mathing let it go ... Hollywood isn't all glits and glamour. Don't sell your soul get out .
We just need our own and stop asking. Do or be like Tyler Perry
Taraji do what makes you happy. You deserve to be happy
We are ALL fatigued; professionally and personally. It’s a daunting time. This was heartbreaking to hear but I respect and appreciate her transparency.
She's a amazing person and actor very talented at what she do❤
I love Sis Taraji’s message but feel he got lost in his response. Why do we have to continually “prove” we are worthy when the majority of our non melanin counter parts haven’t had to take on the same fight. It’s exhausting. Just like being a black woman in AmeriKKKa. Trust & believe …black women OVERSTOOD the pain in T’s message.
Seeing ger cry is so hard.
So sad how black women are treated. Things must change!
I totally believe it so disappointing. Not everyone has the talent she has that we must come together and support.
He talking bout everything but the point Taraji was making on being under paid?
We love you ❤
She definitely talked about this 2 years ago on a talk show… it’s a sham because no matter what job you have Uncle Sam gone get his off top that to me is insane like how did we allow this !
Now that we've heard Taraji, can we get behind Monique? She's been talking about these inequities for YEARS!!!!
If yall really knew who controls the entertainment business then you would understand why this is happening to our people!
I feel her. Black people get paid WAAAY less than the counterparts and Black women are paid even less. And SAG, AFTRA and EQUITY don't do anything about it.
We love you Taraji, and thank you for your vulnerability, openness, and realness.
Sad and True and Hurtful to hear this 😢 This Woman brings so much joy to us as an audience….. Everyone thinks Acting is easy…. The Courage to go against The Most Beautiful People in the World in competition saying “Look at Me”, is a shameful, humbling, humiliating experience! Acting is sometimes a Mental Health time-bomb… and since we all love Art!….. When Actors succeed, they should be Paid for the Simple fact that they keep their sanity.
I agree with her 100%
I want to say we value you we love you and your contributions ,  all of you and you are worthy and you have made a place where we can sit . I appreciate you !
That’s why the box office matters, in other words we need to buy these tickets to see these movies!🍿 🎟️
And now they're shipping in other black ppl on Visa under paying them to  replace black Americans who have fought tooth and nail
This what happened to GIRLFRIENDS.
Gayle King hangs out with the very people that disrespect and low ball  Tarji
Sometimes when you speak up and say something like this in most places they try to shut you down!🫤
When Mo said this, they black balled her.....
😂😂😂😂😂😂 stop chasing money...
If empire made it to 100 episodes at least they xan fet syndication money
I feel her so sad.
We tired of inspiring and uplifting WHERES THE COIN
She should quit she can do anything and get support
If tph talked to people in the music industry about pay and publishing she would cry again
We love ❤️ and support you Taraji in whatever decision yoi choose. You're strong 💪 and know your worth and we hear you and we support ❤️ you 100% Queen.
Thiss. This is so powerfull. I respect Taraji so much. Always did!
when you don't serve the GOAT this is what happenes. IFYKYK
Their salaries need to be posted like athletes.this will work in their favor in the long run. Trust me if they could pay otani the baseball player like bobby bonilla they would
Speak the truth and do what’s best for your future💕🙏🏽 your talent is worth your words……..
Just look at the marketing for Wonka compared to The Color Purple. Yes, they are different types of movies, but both WB.
No one wants to be told, “being in the role is your flowers.” NO, EQUAL PAY‼️This Dude is trying to gloss over the REAL issue. I bet this guy kept a large portion of the money. Whelp she better holler at Marvel. Crying on a show isn’t helping.
I had no intention of seeing this movie b/c I saw the original, it wasn’t  necessarily a “Feel good’’ movie you’d want to watch over and over again, plus the promo tour for this revamp has been so incessant AF BUT hearing this convo makes me want to support these people and their hard work. I believe I will actually go see it before it leaves theaters.
Monique was saying the same things that Taraji is saying now.  They don't want to pay black female actors the same as white female actors. They thing that we are invisible. I don't act but have experienced this in the work place and by our own kind. I pray that God gives her strength to go on.
Oprah is fine coming around and showing herself, why didn’t she make sure these women got paid!!! She was a producer FFS
This is the game of Satin,  he wants to wear you out. Quite and become a teacher of the arts. 😢
Modern day slavery 🥺
Love Taraji several years in the game, they need to pay her!
Well, I hope Oprah paid the women their worth😢????
Well look at the Role they are giving you and who is producing it ( when they looking for that strong . Aggressive black  woman they called your first ) ... you staying in urban kind of movies Darling...try to not urban Hollywood Tyler Perry or 50cent or that cookie role you play ( most of your movies ARE producing by your own poeple.. they are also on budget that Hollywood give them ... at least Vivica fox sometimes act in some international movies produce by them ...let's keep it real we love you Taraji but you play the same aggressive roles in most of your movies 🎬  pull yourself back from all those urban  movies and approache the international producers/ director ...... no offense but some cast director DONT even watch urban / ethnic movies ,, have nothing to do with races but they are not into it .  Therefore they don't know you .. I didn't know of you until baby boy and even after that I saw you on that cookie role simply because I don't watch much urban movies much although I am a black women... so dry your tears you are extremely talented so go pushed different doors ... you got this..
Also what he 's talking about is what has us caught up on silly ass image hunts. Images are important, but what TPH is talking about matters more.
Speak your truth bring out the discrimination change the business of being used and abuse for others satisfaction God got you
I’m a theatre actor out of DC for some reason I’m sort of hesitant about going to California and trying to get into film .. it’s all about the pay … thank you so much Taraji P. Henson for letting the cat out of the bag … theatre don’t pay anything .. but I feel safe being in Theatre …
What she describes happens to every actor/actress - they all have publicists, agents, trainers, etc.  Alot of it depends on how their contracts are structured for residuals, profit sharing, endorsements, licensing, podcasts, speaking engagements, books, etc.
When she said she does it gracefully the director and Danielle looked away. TPH been going thru it from what I could tell at the MJB tv show— depression and anxiety will make you somewhat abrasive. So I know she is trying hard to be her light self but we need to rally around her. I want her to live long and strong like Ruby Dee.
Listen, the first few minutes she’s speaking for ppl at her level and the rest of us working corporate, business or working class jobs. It wears on all of us man, smh  As an actress, she deserves so much more!
There’s people in this world that don’t have food or clean drinking water,and she’s crying….bye!
This is exactly what Monique was going through and they tried to destroy her for it. But like the queens ya are you will triumph.
You can see unhappiness in Ragi,for a while now .I hope she does what she needs to stay mentally ok.....I hope Oprah payed her well....
I’m so sick of ppl saying “give you your flowers”…Pretend flowers does nothing for anyone. That guy really said a whole bunch of nothing. Mo’nique seemed like she was all alone fighting for equal pay for black women in Hollywood. I feel for Taraji, but why did you not support Mo’nique when she was fighting for the very thing you’re here crying about?!
It's harder for our Black actors cause they're working against stereotypes, oppression, and supremacy, all before they even get recognized where they're craft.😢❤
Monique was telling everyone this same thing and they black balled her.
Taraji is a strong woman I like her movie I can do bad all by myself
Be real people! It your own people doing this to you! Look at the picture who you working for? I’m sorry but they’re the ones who kicking you in the butt! You know who they’re! God bless you all!
She’s so over it. Look at her face after the switch to the question to the guy.
When "THEY" don't want to see you or acknowledge you, not treated equally...is a reflection of what "They" think of you‼️💯 But God sees & acknowledges us🙏🏽💯‼️
Danielle seems like a sweetheart.
Where is the rest of the interview?
😐 No sympathy…That “Empire” show she did was trash and horrible for the Black/Hebrew community. So to know they are getting ripped by the executives that use them to negatively influence our people seems more like karma than wrong. 🤷🏽‍♀️
Shd just did the new color purple. So whats. Really going on    but every one think the parkers are talking about is crazy😮
We love you Tee!!!
Taraji has always been and will always be my favorite woman in entertainment.
Where is the full interview??
Good for you Taraji💖Black people should leave that industry...
Taraji and this woe is me campaign is taking away from the movie. You are there to promote this movie. Not complain about a salary you agreed to. She has enough money she can quit. But she isn't going to guilt Hollywood into paying her. She needs to go the Halle Berry and Viola Davis route and create opportunities for herself. Instead of using this Shug role to start a new era she is stuck in the slump she has been in since Empire was cancelled. I don't feel sorry for her because her and her bestie MJB love to wave the black woman scorned flag. Taraji get better not bitter. Slide into directing which pays more. Salli Richardson Whitfield is killing it right now as a director. Taraji you have aged out Cicely Tyson and Eartha Kitt got roles until they died. Its not true for many aging black women its time to create new avenues of income.
This is heartbreaking, I hope she doesn't quit, but I definitely would understand if she did. She is a phenomenal actress, it would definitely be a shame and a tremendous loss to the industry, but she has to do what's best for her well-being.. 😢💕
To the director's point, Black actors and actresses have long done exemplary work! They should still get paid equally, fairly, their worth, period! Did you hear what Taraji just said?!!?
GO AGAINST NICKI. ITS GON COST YA👏👏👏
She would be a great agent helping new actors out to get the right pay.
I only listened to Taraji P. Henson. I skipped through the rest because its much deeper than what that man is saying. I feel those wicked people are putting the pressure on her to sell her soul. And she is not willing to go and tired of it all.  God be with her.
Gayle wasn’t ready for this convo. Complete disregard for her bearing her soul 🫤
I enjoy seeing you acting. Please don't give up, my dear. The Lord is greater, and if the gift that he gave you is this . Don't give up. I totally understand what you are sharing. I will be praying for you. Do what makes you happy, and if moving on is what is best for your life. Is in God's plans 🙏
Love you Taraji P Hensen
We love you Taraji; please don't quit. You are such a great actress. I'm going to watch this movie in honor of you and all the cast of the movie.
Black burn out is real. I left my corporate job a year ago after years of seeing mediocre white men surpass me in salary and promotions while doing a fraction of the work that I do that is simply not valued.  At a certain point you just bow out all together and decide to carve your own path. I'm still figuring that out, but I completely understand where her pain is coming from.  The woman needs a break, but also clearly feels like she can not afford to take one.
Jesus love you my friend, Taraji.
Taraji use that Beautiful singing voice to make an album. Sing for the Lord sweet lady. Make that money that’s waiting for you. We know you can sing. God has a plan for you. Please don’t ever give up. We need you.
Taraji give your pain to God.
Shalom unto you all and many blessings to you and to your beautiful families.   This beautiful woman of substance has the right to feel what she is feeling.  And the man of valour also spoke truth. I do not disagree with what has been shared in this intimate dialogue.  The biased treatment that takes place within this particular realm of influence against people of black descent has everything to do with truth about our original history as a nation of people.   Many in the world of entertainment know who we are, especially those who are set up in positions with "leverage and dominance" (those who are able to control the narrative when it comes to how people of black descent are seen within this realm of influence).  This is why I speak the way I do when it comes to the world of entertainment. I do not speak to degrade or demean those who are a part of this particular world.  But I do speak against how people are treated in their value in this industry, especially when it comes to their distinction in image and when it comes to the value of their gifts, skills, talents, and abilities.  The entertainment industry was never designed to take on the image it has embraced. But it has been mishandled by so many people who sat and still sit in certain positions of authority. And people of black descent have been "secretly" targeted in this world for a very long time. It has been hard to detect by many who are on the outside looking in. Because it has been hidden well behind the "glam, the glitter, the excitement, and the images of what dreams and fame has been sold off to look like.   Only if people knew the actual experiences many of our people go through in this industry in order to make it. Some are manipulated and persuaded to do some very demeaning and inhumane things to be significant and famous. And it is done that way on purpose so the truth about their value in image can be mocked, reviled, and disrespected, along with the enrichment of their original history as a nation of people. These particular "circle of people" in authority feel like as long as they throw a few dollars in the direction of our people who are a part of this industry, they can continue with the degradation and with the misgovernment of our value as a people.   Money is not the issue in this industry. The issue lies in how the value of a human soul is seen, especially the value of a soul that is of black descent.  Anytime a dollar is put up against the actual value of a human soul, especially one that is of black descent, it reveals a very telling truth about the souls affected by these manipulative agendas. It exposes the presence of a real truth about our worth as a nation of people. And a "dollar" is used to control the narrative of that truth.  When in fact the original weight of our influence is not found in a "dollar." And they know it. What we carry outweighs the value of a dollar. What we carry is weighty enough to change the world without currency. And that is a very deep truth. Money is used in this world to keep people under an unhealthy control. Money is not the menace or the villain in this story. Ignorance is the menace in this story. Because if ignorance can make a certain group of people show disregard to the actual value of a human soul, especially the souls of those of black descent, then it exposes how they see their own value in this area.  God Bless you all and Shalom unto you and to your beautiful families.
I feel your pain Taraji but my own pain is much different. I am in pain for all children and what the dirty world does to them. They are slaves and it makes me sick.
This is way deeper than "Race".  Please. with the race card.  My comment is not a conversation. I will not be replying.
It's the racism for me....SMH Man I wanna hug Taraji!❤🙏🏽
I am not saying that we don’t face unequal pay in Hollywood but at this point in her career, who is her agent? They are more at fault than anybody because they are failing to negotiate what she deserves. Plus, her credits haven’t been impressive since Hidden Figures. Why isn’t her agent getting her better roles?
She is brave for speaking out. Monique said it. Viola said it.
On another note, I don’t like Gayle as an interviewer. She interrupts a lot of
Amen. That's a damn shame. When we as the public hear these figures it's a gasp😮
I remember a few years back when she was doing empire and was doing several movies, and she made a statement saying that people think that when you are in a lot of films that people think that’s you’re just popping and making all this money, but she was saying that she has to do several projects to equal the same as a popular white actress doing one movie/project.￼ basically she was saying that for a movie she’ll make one for the amount as a popular white actress meaning that she hast to do those four films so that person is one in the cost of living in California is out rages so you have to really hustle, but at this point in her career, she shouldn’t have to do for five movies at a time, and a TV show just to get paid what someone else is paid that looks differently than her.
Taraji P. Henson is one of the greatest actress going. But the ugliness of Hollywood is raunchy and sickening.
I’m cryin! I had this same breakdown on my own podcast. Emotions came outta nowhere but enough is enough
I feel her pain, too. But let me say this, and I have to say this, where was she and Gabrielle Union, Tasha Smith, Sanaa Lathan, Nia Long, and the list goes on and on, when Monique was out fighting for black actors and actresses to get equal pay as their white counterparts, when Monique told people that she only got $50,000 for the movie 🎬 Precious directed by Lee Daniel's that she won an Oscar for and was blackballed. On top of that, Oprah wanted Monique to promote the movie Precious at the Cannes Festival in France 🇫🇷 and Monique said, "Wait a minute,"I only have $50,000. Now, Taraji is feeling the pain. No one wanted to fight with Monique.
😅😅😅 So she made 3,500,000 after paying everyone out and she is complaining. 😅😅😅 I guess she should quit and work at McDonalds instead. There they allow the employee to demand to get paid what they want. 😅😅😅 Blacks the clowns of America.
Thank you for being honest about the industry and how much an actor gets paid. If someone is interested in the industry, they can make an informed decision.❤
Love her
Don't quit..I wouldn't quit my job because of it neither..just find ways to save more money on what you spend.
Amen ❤❤
This is so heartbreaking
I think maybe our black actors need to collaborate with Nollywood go to Nigeria and work with that industry… collaborate and take the movie industry by storm
Father God be with her. I prayed for her. I commend Taraji P. Henson for wanting to get out of that wicked sick industry. I am sure she is tired!! Who wants to act and entertain day in and day out., and first everybody is not down with selling their soul to the devil. Lord be with her.  My comment is not a conversation. I will not be replying.
Since rich and famous Black celebrities aren’t being paid as they should, then the lesser known Black actors and actresses definitely isn’t being paid well. I really think about Black people that play in slave movies and shows. Some of them literally bare themselves and they probably wasn’t treated right.
years ago Oscar Winning Actress and Comedian Monique said the same things Taraji just shed tears about. We need to be good to each other
mmmmm…mmmm..mm
Give it to God He rains on the just and the unjust
#taraji… Please don’t cry, you make me cry. I sincerely feel your concerns. You are one of the BIGGEST actor… It’s sad you’re not being paid correctly… Many like you aren’t.
Don't think your 401K safe either when I tell you the government eat that shit up when you take it out. It's misleading tax free . When they issue that check almost half is gone of whatever you put in there. Then they tax you again when you file looking more like 60 for government  40 for me.
Monique tried to get more black actors to stand with her against this issue, but because she was being labeled as “difficult” to work with everyone dismissed what she was saying.
Monique and how she was gaslighted ........we need an apology for Monique
We love taraji, its out here too damn it
This made me cry 😢
That was real exhaustion and we've all felt it...can't imagine the weight of it on Taraji's level...
saying all this mess while on a press run for the movie shes the main star in is just weird, its screaming self-pity...
Taraji .we recognize you're one of the greats. .The first installment of the Color purple was awesome and yet no one got their flowers.  But they kept pushing even harder.  Just keep doing your gift God sees you Sista. One day One day
Just google fantasia networth and that tells the story
We all getting paid less in way, but we all where we are because of that. So if you can do it on you own go for it and stop complaining. This people are there to build us. What happened next is all you.
It means get another agent.
Oprah and Steven Spielberg were executive producers, so why did they have to fight so hard to be cast. That makes no sense.
Tariji follow what your intuition is telling you   I truly understand  even though I am not movie actress. I know Jehovah loves you.❤ like you said need multiply incomes.
Before she even spoke for a bit now I've been seeing something on her that is wearing her down and I will be praying for her!
Monique was right about everything!
Black folk are still some of the most group of people that everyone of other races STAY curious about & in our business. We live in their heads rent free!  If the studios etc PROMOTED these endeavors like they do the plethora of silly azz all why cast productions...the people will come.  They need to stop playing.
She was in my dreams last night for real  and living in a apt .. somewhere in a low cost area bo lie
How much did Oprah pay these ladies for The Color Purple?
Being a BLACK in HOLLYWOOD!!..
That’s Crazy She Deserves So Much More. Pray 🙏🏾 For #TarajiPHenson #TheColorPurple
Very well said! I feel Taraji❤. She is from my hometown🎉🎉❤❤❤
I feel your pain “Taraji” Tired of Not getting Paid What We are…..Worth! 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾💜
I swear it's getting harder and harder for American Africans to make it in Amerikkka
Excellent actress and needs to be compensated for her hard word! She is the BEST!
The infrastructure of Hollywood is based off of the back of blacks  being took to the cleaners. For example the blaxploitation movies saved Hollywood back in the day. Unfortunately many didn’t get their just due and Hollywood won’t admit how black movies breathed new life into the industry.
The Math ain’t Math N
Its falling on deaf ears, but hopefully this time someone will listen. If i remember correctly, Mo'nique has been down this road before (with not only Netflix but "Hollywood" as well).  But because ppl were so focused on her personal life (in regards to how she interacts with her husband) and the delivery of her message, everyone wanted to call Mo'nique bitter. So now that there are tears involved and the tone is softer, maybe there will be a pay raise. Who knows.
Dear Taraji P.Henson,  Your achievements are priceless. Thank you for being my favorite actress.  God bless you.  ✊🏾💪🏾🇰🇪❤
So MONIQUE was right. And so was TLC.
I feel her in pain. I'm an actor or celebrity . I have been a nurse assistant for 24 years, and I am not still getting a pay that is not worthy. I live what I do. I just understand why I'm not getting paid for my experience. I deserve it.  I don't get enough to make it.
Taraji you too brilliant and smart for them to treat you like that I'm sorry for that pls don't quite you guys need to discuss it
I felt this! .. I feel this way about my job. .. I care for the elderly and disabled.  I’ve been saying for years that the feeling of not being appreciated and fairly compensated for the work you do is like being in an abusive relationship.
Smh what kind of money is Meryl Streep getting an all the other white counterparts smh 🤦🏽‍♀️
I have to say...this makes me fall in love with her more graciously and openly, and I think I have judged her wrongly for years...she has been TOUGH and had to be strong, yet this is the truth: she is exhausted and vulnerable, and this is hard to watch but honest and beautiful. We support you
Inspiration is commendable, and I'm certain that they are sold on that part!   However, it doesn't negate the fact that they are undervalued and underpaid in the industry, and the marketing budgets are simply not the same.  I hope they are at least getting paid extra for their press tour.  They have convinced me to be there opening day as my family was for Dream Girls 🖤
I understand what she means, but her pay as an actress will still be a whole lot better, than working regular 9 to 5. I’d switch with her!
Did anyone ask her about pinching that baby, to make it cry, in “Baby Boy”?
😅 Bullshit
We can’t AFFORD to go to the MOVIES!!!!!!
We love you. And I would hate to see you go but do what you have to do for you and know if you go our HEARTS GO WITH YOU❤❤❤❤❤❤
This could be why her energy with Oprah was off! Seems Oprah is doing the same to taraji that she did with Monique
She's not the first to say it, unfortunately, it's only receptive from the ppl that are favored.
😂😂😂 I love the truth, y’all broke tell it She need some milk and a CDL 1:50 I know she annoying Taraj
Regina King,Taraji, Vivica,Tichina,Regina Hall,Elise O'neal,Paula Jai Parker.....I can go on.  There are all great actresses, overlooked, and underpaid.
Wasn't this Monique like over 10 years ago???
Wow
Yeah...in that industry "YOU" work a lot and they take all your ideas to boot.  I knew those highly publicized paychecks were fake...same thing happens in sports...need to go back to having our own and it's gonna happen.
This shows that we are all on the same structured agenda. Whether an actor/actress, a factory worker, a nurse/doctor, or a restaurant worker.... we all get back less than what we give. Stay strong and keep pushing. 💪 💯
Thanks Teraji! Where's the lie Monique told 👀🤔🤷🏾‍♂️
Love to Taraji…
I hope Oprah paid ya'll. However, make your own and stop waiting on others. Black Americans are big consumers. Look what they did for Black Panther.
This is why I believe from children, we need parents that will invest in us, on how to be entrepreneurs establish our own business, like Tyler Perry built his own studios, so he didn't have to beg the masses for a dime! To help him.
Taraji I’m so very very very very sorry that you’re going through this and I pray that things will get better for you 🙏🏾❤️
This is what Monique was fighting for when they trashed her...Thanks for  your courage and bravery to say this
That's 3,500,000 left over after 30%.
So Monique was right all along
We thought it was a merit based business. People are talented and think that that’s enough. It’s not. The people that control the industry choose who becomes a celebrity and get into the big house. I stopped auditioning. I’m much happier. Like Dame Dash said, be your own boss.
Or getting paid fair but expected to work more than your peers, that's been my experience. Love to Taraji. I doubt she reads the comments but if you're in a similar position, take time for your health.
I truly understand what you're going through from a lower level.  Love you and love you all. ❤❤❤
Ok... so hold on.... you out there praising Miss Oprah... and You tired. Did Miss Oprah not pay you your worth!!! Lets say that as it is!!! Taraji is BRILLIANT... She deserves as do all these Ladies. Lets be real. miss oprah produced this movie... Hello!!!
Most people don't even get the opportunity to earn half the money she gets . I bet Beyonce isn't crying .
She is one of the best and should be paid as such. She deserves it. N if it comes to her quitting she will definitely be missed n it will be our loss..
Where Monique at?
This why Terrence Howard got tired too!
God says hang on in there T He got your back.He see you and will see you get your rewards soon.
Felt every word Taraji said. Absolute shame and disgrace that at this level and stage of her career that she along with other black actors still have to fight for bare minimum when they’ve already proven they can command films successfully with high box-office turnout while their wyte counterparts continue to be lauded and lavishly rewarded even when their projects fall flat. These studio heads and execs are being exposed for their biased biogtry. Keep ur head up sis - they won’t break your soul!
This is so real.
This is true in EVERY single industry women of color are in.
I HATE to pull out the race card!...but I feel Taranji's pain. No matter which way u wanna put it, we get the shorter end of the stick. This woman is a brilliant, passionate actress who puts her heart n soul into every movie she stars in. I even thought she was a mega millionaire by now!!! She's been in the game LONG!!!. I want to do a blog and it's no secret that personalised branding is what will make money...but I keep looking for ways to hide my face online cos what I want to do is normally done by white skinned women who are making a killing online. I love my skin, I love being black...and wldnt want to be any other way...but the discrimination just pisses me off!
And just imagine the 'everyday' Black woman in Corporate and otherwise...yes it definitely wears on you.
I’m an actress in LA and I’ve become so disenchanted with the business and trying to “make it”.
Taraji P Henson, please be encouraged, you are a blessed and great actress. I am very proud of you and how you give of yourself. I pray that God will open doors that no man can close, and close doors that no man can open. You are beautiful, stronger than you think, continue to shine. We need to see you, because when we see you, we see us; BLACK BEAUTIFUL AND STRONG. LOVING YOUR BLACKNESS AND WHO YOU ARE. I PRAY THAT GOD'S WILL CONTINUE TO COVER, SHIELD AND PROTECT YOU AND YOUR FAMILY. THANK YOU FOR NOT BEING SELFISH, BUT BEING THAT TEACHER, A  BOSS, ENTREPRENEUR, SISTER, MOTHER, AUNTIE AND A STRONG BLACK WOMEN. I LOVE YOU ALL ROCKING YOUR BLACKNESS. AS A BLACK PEOPLE, YOU HAVE TO COME TOGETHER AND DO IT ALL; PRODUCE, DIRECT, WRITE, ECT. BUT YOU CAN'T MAKE A DEAL WITH THE DEVIL; YOU HAVE TO HAVE PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE SAME MIND, VISION AND HEART. RESPECT EACH OTHER. THE MEN LOOK OUT FOR THE WOMEN AND VICE VERSA. LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! I LOVE YOU. ❤❤❤❤❤
This is sad as hell.
Why don't Black people collectively create our own film and movie industry!? Why are we in 2023 expecting white folks to open opportunities for us!? I emphasize with Black actors/actresses about the discrimination they face in Hollywood, but  can't we do for self by establishing our own studios, movie and film industries?. We did it in the past...( Check out Oscar Micheaux's legacy). We can do it again!
Love you Taraji🙏 but Gayle you can go STR8 to Hell!!
Sounds just like Real Estate!!! Take time for yourself
Say "no" and suffer the consequences like Monique. Remember what Monique said about those she said "no" too.
I just want to hug her. She deserves to make 10-20mil per projects. She's such a great actress and with performances throughout the yrs. Fuck you hollywood.
This is what Monique has been saying for years.
I love Taraji she is an Amazing actress PERIOD!! And worth all and even more than she can even IMAGINE!!
She is such a force in this industry and she deserves to be paid as the remarkable talent that she is. How is she in this position?? So Crazy
Oh stop Taraji! Not believing it! Sorry
Its time we create pur own movie industry. Not with people like Tyler Perry. Allow our money to go more to entertainers. Not the colonizers and the evil ones who work for them. Lets take our art back and stop the predatory culture.
Pray on it...🙏🤲
This is so true no matter how hard u work your still struggling but I am proud of you
It’s a jungle out here …
Taraji ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ sista you are a force an amazing talent and the realest representation of sistas across this planet!!!
Damn...I just want to hug this lady...you never know what ppl are going thru...
they dont like how she looks, i go through this too its a bird brain racist world
Woo Chile this has me in tears.  Cause this is the realist thing I've heard a black actress in my generation say this.   I love Taraji, and I always wanted to be an actress.
My heart goes out to out to her. I’ll support whatever she does even if it’s not acting
Monique told yall
Where do we watch/listen to the whole interview? This part takes my breath away. We as Black women have to fight twice as hard for scraps!! Keep fighting. ❤❤
This hit me hard 😢 same thing happens in an office setting.  I have a degree, you know how many people have gone up the ladder instead of me
Wtf… y’all made Taraji cry!!!! Get the effing strap!!! Get the strap.
He ain’t said nothing! Trying to make Taraji feel better but he drifted off! 😩😩
Monique been said that!!😮 Monique sued and got hers!!
You can’t quit! Monique didn’t quit!
Love ❤️ her she’s so real 💯
she is good the problem they dont like the black look, if they use you you will get less, they think she is ghetto even though she is not, if i was heard i would write star and produce my own movies  racist hollyweird is not going anywhere,
Then leave the industry.
I felt this. I felt her tears. I’m not an actress but being brown/black in any industry can be exhausting.
💚🙏🏾😫 I love her!
On Jennifer Hudson show, I saw something in Taraji eyes that worried me. She didn't look right. I am praying for her strength and well being. TMH will make this right and Taraji will make it. Peace
Taraji H slavery is not over for blacks....wipe your tears babe, hold your head up and lead the way for our young generation😮
It’s a demonic process used to control us.
❤😢❤😢❤
😢
When you get to a certain level you gotta eventually start your own thing. Hollyweird are pimps. If you don't like the show turn the channel.  The actor strikes proved that it's about the talent. Not the Corporations. Get off Black Women's backs. Then complain you can't walk. Black Women are tired.  💜💜💜💛💜💜💜    Black Girl Train
We love you Taraji, you deserve it all we celebrate you we love you and we thank you 💐💐
Taraji thank you, Sis! And if you have to walk away do it.  Can only imagine how exhausted you must be. Got my tix and looking forward to supporting. Hopefully it breaks chains and box-office records!
She's the only one crying about money.  The other women just seem grateful.  Gratitude,  makes room for more.
Great interview, moved me to tears. Love you Queen TPH!! HU…you Know!!!!  Gayle please stop cutting your guest off and talking over them. Please let them finish. Thank you.
There are many other occupations she can decide on.
We have been placed in a Caste system on purpose. The so called Industry needs to be eradicated!?  These Actors, Artist Performers, deserve their due. Without Them there's nothing! Their talent is Golden. Others profiting and not wanting to share the bounty! Greedy Beings.  Some how I hope the Talent can get free of the leeches.
Your hair is so Cute...Taraji P. Love you...😍
When she was in benjamin button with brad pit and did a wonderful job. And they treat her like she was a new tv commercial actress. I hate this for our Black stars.
🙏🏾🩵🙏🏾
I felt u taraji I really did now the world understood what Monique was saying about being underpaid everyone deserves what they worth them two sisters deserve it Pray Taraji God will open doors that Noone won't be able to close
❣️🙏🏻
Focus on what God can do … u love helping others so I know He will bless u tremendously he sees  your heart❤
Too talented, beautiful and successful to be dealing with such disrespect for something she loves to do. The craft of Theatre Arts is done out of pure love of the craft. So I see why she’s crying, she’s hurt.
She tired of getting pennies.  Work a regular job like us everyday people.  The struggle is real..
Great actress, but u can't expect to be paid more than a life saving Doctor or Surgeons....sadly, many in this make-believe world actually do!
Now that’s sad, my heart is aching because I know she’s hurting. I watched her in Empire, baby boy, the lady is a great actor, there’s no way in the world I thought that she was not making the money that she deserve. This is crazy,, but remember you may not get your roses heal on earth and the things that you deserve but if you keep your hand and God hands everything that you deserve will be granted, may not be in this life because we’re only here for a moment, I have a gift, and gifts and talent, and it seems that so always got to start at the bottom and people have seen it already, so I get what she saying why you have to keep starting from the bottom when you already didn’t see my gift, life is not fair, but just remember this is not our home, do your very best what you do leave the rest of the Lord Jesus Christ, continuing your gift don’t give up my heart ache when she cried
This makes me sick. She's so blessed, but she's ungrateful. The more grateful you are, the more comes your way.  Any waitress at Dennys will trade places with you. It's sickening...you have been given a great opportunity.  We need to check our attitude sometimes.  Go in your prayer closet and seek God. You blessed whether you know it or not.  Some of us are dealing with real life.  Not being able to meet the bills etc. All of us will trade with you.  Take a second look at your blessings
There's a high price for operating in the belly of the Beast success in Hell definitively Comes at a high cost
Intentionally perpetuated slavery sharecropping for instance
Black people work very hard and seem to never get their full share of the fruit pie. It might take many parts to make a project what it is but without the actor making the stories come to life it would not be possible. This means Black people need to start working for themselves. Start making your independent films and invent your ownership. We work hard as h@ll and always hear others work harder than we do. So, I hear you Taraji. You just do not know what actors or anyone else is going through financially when it comes to careers. People looking from the outside might see you work hard but forget how far the economic gaps are between the black community and every other group in society. We can only value ourselves because as we can see others will not do it. Taraji is too great of an actress to be done this way. She is always working and to feel like she does has to be very discouraging but I say she should make a lane for for herself. I am so sorry to hear this.
As a black female engineer this resonated with me. Black women no matter what industry are so disrespected and underpaid. The goal post is always moving. Who is an ally for the black women?
😢
✝️ WOW Mmm 🤔 I REALLY UNDERSTAND I AM NOT IN YOUR POSITION I DEFINITELY FEEL THE SADDEST IN YOUR HEART MY SISTER IT DOES NOT MATTER YOU ARE DEFINITELY RIGHT ✝️ ✨DO NOT ALLOW NO ONE , NO BODY COME IN TO TAKE ARE DESTROYING YOUR SOUL YOU ARE A BEAUTIFUL AMAZING ACTOR MY PRAYERS ARE DEFINITELY WITH YOU AND ALL MY BLACK SISTA ‘ MAKING A DIFFERENCE I THANK YOU FOR ALL YOU AND WITH THIS ✨😇 JUST CONTINUE DOING THE RIGHT THING YOU BELIEVED IN WHAT YOU DO AND YOU DO IT VERY WELL SO MY SISTA KEEP STANDING AND FEELING GOOD YOUR STORY IS YOUR LEGACY OF TO YOUR SELF AS WELL AS THE PEOPLE’s OF THE WORLD ITS OKAY TO CRY TO ALLOW TEARS BRING ON PEACE TO THE ‘ HEART , SOUL , ✝️ BLESSING TO ALL OF YOU FOR MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN JESUS BLESSING NAME AMEN AMEN AMEN
We keep talking about fighting for more and sometimes still we don’t see anyone getting up fighting for more. We have to stop waiting for the future changes. We need to make the changes now. The barriers will never be broken if we keep staying comfortable.
Did the billionaire Oprah pay what she deserved for color purple.
Black ppl stop begging your oppressors and enemies to give what we can create, HAVE created and built. DO YOUR OWN!
Taraji, youran amazing, outstanding, powerful, gifted, unique, and gifted actress. IF you leave, I will be crushed and a huge hole will be left in the movie world. Love you❤
the math ain't mathing!  YES YES I AGREE
I don't blame her anger. When reality stars make more than a trained actor who has worked in the business for years..there's a problem.
He did all that talking and did not address the money where is the money? Show Taraji the money.
It is okay because GOD sees ALL of the black women that have been overlooked , disrespected and shortchanged in their life ....... The bottom shall be on top and the top shall be on the bottom. ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT!!!!! THE day is near😊
OMG! I have ached and cried over not fulfilling my dreams, God knows us and He knows where we fit in and where we are to be.  God bless you, keep your head up, DON’T let “Them” take away from you.  🙏🏽🌈🌞
Black panther and Spider-Man shattered global box office records & Beyoncé broke the record for the largest audience this century for a female in Belgium, of all places. She had a reported 53 thousand fans at Belgium's King Baudouin Stadium… so to say blacks don’t translate overseas is false and a myth
Same thing Mo'Nique was saying.
But Taraji and especially you @Gayle King was quiet when Monique spoke out 🤨 You Gayle, and Oprah and Fantasia are the PROBLEM‼️
Nobody cares. Cicely, Angela, Viola, and all those before her have been screaming from the mountain tops and nothing.
My energy donation: thank you so very much for sharing the truth. Your truth. I am so grateful to know we all have human experiences and can be open and honest with ourselves with those experiences 🙏🏽.  Thank you. I am tipping my white hat to you.
I will say I hope this movie does well… it’s not original like Black Panther. That movie was groundbreaking and we may never see another like it besides the sequels. And after the last I hope there aren’t too many to come cause it just is going to be missing the star power he mentioned during press runs. I would hate to feel unappreciated like taraji, hidden figures alone should get her through the doors. Also, I think empire hurt her cause many of those studios probably didn’t watch or like it. Maybe they typecast her and an audition is needed in their eyes. But she is a trained actress snf we know from her body of work that she has the rage. I’m not sure but Halle Berry might also be an issue. They don’t think name recognition for Black actresses but they would just super stars like Beyoncé or Rihanna who I also heard were considered for the roles.
She's explained this too many times.
I 😭 with you because I feel her pain and certainly understand.  It's very similar working in the Real Estate Industry.  We work so hard and at the end of the day we have to fight for our income that we worked so hard to earn.  And people have the audacity to say you don't deserve your hard earned pay. This World ain't right and time is running out to get it right.    REVELATION 1:1-3  The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John:  2 Who bare record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw.  3 Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for the time is at hand.  KJV  Taraji, Sister please know them battles don't belong to you to fight.  Turn them over to the Lord Jesus Christ. 🙏🏿   Until you take your hands completely off of them and turn them over to him, you will continue to be troubled by them.  HE has other task for you to fill. Your past ❤️‍🩹 your 🎁 present, and your future 🪟❣️
Stop fighting and start filing lawsuits for equity. Julia Roberts is getting multi million for barely doing anything. The data is out there. Start analyzing the industry on our own. Produce our own movies
Taraji was paid $150,000 for the Curious mind of Benjamin little. A movie that grossed millions!!
I love her. I love seeing her as a human, wonderful actor, beautiful human. Inside and out.
Listeeennnnn and yet the weirdos on Tik Tok - trying to drag Oprah but this kind of stuff has been wayyyyyy before Oprah and the money she honestly earned for herself - and now that Taraji has spoken out - she will be labeled as Difficult to Work With as well?....They been playing in BLACK PEOPLE faces!!!.....Watch how they flip this shit on her....Also please overstand in any field or profession WE ARE NEVER TO GO BUT SO FAR DARLINGS~ BUT BE GREAT ANY DAMN WAY!
Taraji is an awesome actress who is able to play in various roles. I can understand why she is frustrated and hurt. It must be extremely difficult to watch other actors get  paid more for less effort just because who they are.  I pray she hangs in there a little longer before she decides to quit acting. 🙏 ❤
Taraji , thank you!! I always said why? Is this so off balanced  as far as the financial part. So sad
We understand Taraji.  They’re lying so they do not give your worth.  Taraji do whatever you think is best!!!!
She complains too much. How about you start your own production company like Reese did? You’re big enough
I feel for her😢
Systemic Slavery
She speaks facts. The industy is rough. I think Taraji the more you continue to do your own projects outside of acting and gain more control you will have more peace. In this biz you have to have the right people around you and supporting you. It sounds like its an up hill battle. It may be time girl to really look at the way you have been going about things and step back and find another way  that will be fufilling and bring in the income you need. Sounds to me like yeah once you create those external income streams so u don't have to be concerned about bills that should free you up to take on roles and negotiate contracts that alighn with you. You get that you can't and shouldn't depend on this industry alone to pay the bills. Continue to create those additional income streams.Once u gain financial independence than u can set up your own production company and do the parts and movies you want to make so you are fufilled as an artist, Until your are financially free and in control of your destiny  it sounds like there will be more of the same BS. I'm looking forward to seeing you in the new Color Purple. Girl you are a good actress. U don't need this crap. Take charge you can do it. Sending you prayers of love a support sis. I understand how it is.I'm working towards the same goal  being totally independent and having as many income streams as possible so it will give me freedom to do what ever it is that I want to do. Having total control over your life and freedom is priceless.

This was the most powerful interview of the whole press run of The Color Purple! I as a black man teared up
She ain’t quitting she is just frustrated. This is why we need to support these actors when they take strikes.
Taraji we love you!!!🥰🥰🥰🥰🌹🌹🌹🌹💯💯💯💯 NO soul selling Taraji God’s got that!!!🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
The people that run Hollywood are greedy, evil, and constantly want to put out their own agenda, values, and opinions
The bag 💰is history just what it is short staff everywhere and the bluffing is all over the place
She said in her Sag Afta interview THIS MONTH that she almost had to walk away from COLOR PURPLE. Her most recent film, because they were low balling her. Goodness.
It is simply bevause we dont own the industry..If we want the full pay, we must go back to boycotting..boycot every industry and evrything associated to industries refusing to pay. We don't boycott because we are not willing to lose it all. But we have to be willing to lose to win. Stop begging these industries to know your worth. Terrence howard is doing a great thing by suing.
This is what monique was talking about and Hollywood blacked balled her her own people turned thier backs on her
Unfortunately this treatment is in every sector of the economy. African Americans is not treated fairly and it is a disgrace..period. Being tired is an understatement. There is really no words to describe in the American dictionary  how this sector colonial/criminal enterprise inhumane treatment is. It is SOOOO important to STOP relying on this criminal enterprise for your liberty, equality, and our economic stability. BUILDING OUR OWN INSTITUTIONS IS SO VITAL and the only way of surviving now and in the future.
This is soooo painful because these two women steal the screen when they are on it. Taraji is the goat of all acting…
I could see something wasn't right in her interviews.
This is heartbreaking. She is an extraordinary actress and have to do other things to keep the money flowing.  But her white counterparts can make one movie a year for 10 or 20 million, which mean they are probably making much more.  But Taraji only makes a million or less and she is a leading lady.
Taraji this is now your assignment,God chose you to sound the alarm and be the light for the ones coming behind you. You are a force in this industry and you will see how the 'prayers of the righteous avails much'. I love you and will be praying with &for you!  "TGBTG" 💖🙏🏽😘💐❤️
He said a lot BUT didn’t address the issue Taraji talked about.  Being PAID FAIRLY.  We understand the culture significance of the movie but the point continues “these black women are not getting paid fairly.”
We get the short end of the stick in every aspect of our lives. It's tiresome and heartbreaking.
❤T
Who is that man because he is so fine.
Dont quite Ms T we weren't build to break!! Stand strong and keep strayin God is the Highest Power
I’m so tired of hearing about broke actors - nexxxt - get a therapist …
👑🌹🙏🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The pain comes when your value is defined by your compensation. When you seek validation from others, it means that you don’t see your own value. The reality is no one will ever see your worth if you don’t. And when you see your worth, you won’t allow others to put you in a box where you’re having to fight. There is no fighting to be seen and heard when you’ve healed your pain because your worth is no longer determined by someone or something outside of yourself. 🦋
This upsets me so much
This is absolutely beautiful 👏🏽👏🏽🏆💜
I teared up., you do get tired. Be not weary in doing well.
Well Monique has been saying this and nobody stood with her now she crying about it
Hollywood is not God, go do something else with your talent. Sometimes we are sititng in prisons with the door wide open. Influencers are making more than them. ❤
Peace and Blessings! She is very brilliant and talented, along side Angela Bassett and on and on.....but I truly believe the only way to get the love and appreciation that she deserves is to do exactly as Tyler Perry did,  he got it Right! MS TARAJI P HENSON YOU are UNIQUE , know it, embrace it and shine brightly like the star that you are! Higher Vibrations going upwards and outwards in forward movement! Peace!🙏❤️
Pay the  woman.
Stop depending, create your OWN movies
I hope she gets what she deserves bc I'd hate to see her quit acting. She's inspiring with her craft. 💔
Facts, Taraji! ❤
😂
She’s in full drama mode. Stop bullstuffin’ Taraji🤓
Be thankful still, you not European
God bless you Taraji..we luv u.. U are the best in the game rite now!!
Monique won an Oscar and they blackballed her. Simply for asking what she is worth. Taraji deserves what she is owed too, but like Lee Daniels arrogant words to Monique, Hollywood wants u "to play the game" while their whyte counterparts are getting paid millions.
Oprah is a billionaire. She needs to give bonuses to each lead.  Gayle doing this interview she should be texting her BFF O.
Oh my heart goes out for her.
Thank you Taraji for all your great work, Many More Blessings and Prosperity to you. Thank you Sirius for sharing ❤
WHEW!!!! God bless black women!!!
That’s what Monique was saying and fighting for.
Thank You girl for being so real and transparent... This is why we love❤ You TP!!!!! From the DMV we will always have your back, whatever project you r in. I'm a getting ticket. We love You 💪🏾do what you have to do to sustain your mental health bc you are all that!!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤✊🏿✊🏿✊🏿✊🏿✊🏿✊🏿✊🏿🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿💯💯💯💯💯💯💯THANK YOU THANK YOU!!
I am sorry that Taraji and other black actors still feel that way. This just means that the #SagStrike is for nothing
Pay them ppl 1st then we talk bout healing etc
So what about Tyler Perry? I understand that she and he are great friends. Is this the same thing that's happening with studio too?
We love you Taraji.  Please don't give up - continue to fight and we will continue to support you.  You are one of the BEST!
I feel you sister and you are in my prayers! #OHHS
That's gotta be a complicated to answer when you're asked this by one of your handlers' besties....... okra put gayle up to cornering her ...... BUT WHEN YOU *REPEATEDLY WILLFULLY* ALIGN WITH soopreemazzy's PAWNS, WTF DO YOU EXPECT?? 2:28  And TO KNOW THAT gayle IS DOING THE SAME -- RIGHT IN YOUR FACE 2:46  But you're sitting in front of one of their favorite pawns, soooooooo -- THAT SHIP HAS SAILED, cuzzo. I hope she's ready because she got her "fame". They'll soon come knocking -- and gayle will unlock the door for'em. MAY THE ODDS BE EVER IN YOUR FAVOR! And I hope the popularity/affiliations was worth the part of your soul you had to give up for it......🤷🏽‍♀
Danielle!!!! That’s your color girl!!!!❤
T please don't quit!  I feel you, I really feel you.  You do get tired of being sick and tired of the same thing.  You will win!  ❤
When Monique was saying y’all told her to quit crying but the industry is evil
Over worked and under appreciated. I felt it to my soul "I'm tired"
We are the Only Race that will not poll our resources and Unite. Without that, we will never have leverage.
Taraji, I have seen you as one of my young aunties/bis sister ever since you came on the scene. I don’t like that you are not being compensated like the superstar you are. While I would love to watch you continue to steal our hearts with every new role, it is more important to me that you are well and at peace in every way. Do whatever you have to do for yourself, internally and externally, to make sure you are well. I love you and I am rooting for you.❤🤗🥰
Follow your heart. Restore, We love you, and will support you always Queen.
Why does Oprah get paid so much when Taraji does more work.
Wow and she's a great actress don't quit
I am crying and I feel so broken down for her. I didn't know until this moment that Taraji P. Henson is family and I Love her.  When will WE THE PEOPLE Finally get a say on how things should go!!! I do not want selfish, rich people that vote NO to a fair living wage across the board, free healthcare, etc. and YES to arresting and putting a 10 yr. old boy in Mississippi on 3 months probation for public urination IN CHARGE! They need to go home and do something else for a living. I understand it when Taraji says she is tired. Pay talented actors the same.
No one ever talks about why we need to pay so much in taxes ; that right there itself is deadening
This never happens! 🥹❤️‍🔥 Real honesty. It's sad and despicable, and I also know how it feels just on the music side instead. Imagine, being a legend like Taraji and still being undervalued and overworked. I pray she doesn't quit, but I understand the REALITY of life and what comes with having a passion that you believed was your purpose.. and still having a life to pay for. God Bless her.
this GUY said NOTHING that will HELP BLACKS get EQUAL PAY!! what a joke,
Taraji is soooo talented and it doesn’t make any sense why she doesn’t get paid what she feels is owed to her she had the same problem when she made The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button she only got paid a fraction of what her Co-Stars got for that film and it is sad that Black women in 2023 are still getting underpaid this has got to change.
Wow! I hate to see her cry bc you can hear she's tired! I truly felt her! I can honestly say I'm enjoying the press run and excited for the movie! Every interview has touched me in a special way and I feel so inspired & for that I feel God will provide and bless them! I love black people but black women especially! 💜💕
Fk it... Do what you gotta do Taraji. As much as we love to see you in this Hollywood space go live a life you deserve. Go get your money in orher arenas you will always have the love and the support of the community 💯 Eff Hollyweird‼️
❤❤❤🙏
I absolutely feel her pain and concern 😢
I hope she start producing her own plays , shows etc ❤❤❤
Don't praise me, pay me!!!  Praise is adoration.  Pay is compensation.
Awww Taraji, don’t cry boo😔
I love Taraji❤. She is such an inspiration. Black women in every industry are making the same complaint. They are doing this by design. It’s a form of violence. We are all blessed by what Taraji has already given to the world. If she never does anything I’m so grateful to have lived in a time where she exists. Just because they are playing in our faces doesn’t mean the work wasn’t excellent.   Taraji you deserve the big dollars for your excellence. What does it mean that you aren’t receiving them? It means they are exploiting your talent. It means a lot of things haven’t changed. But I hope their mistreatment never makes you doubt the value you have added to millions. You are so loved. ❤
Stay strong, Taraji. As  a Black woman, it's  hard  period. Stay strong Taraji ❤❤❤❤❤❤.
My God this breaks my heart 😢 Father God PLEASE PROTECT the black people in the entertainment industry in Jesus name 🙏🙏❤️❤️
I tell you what it’s not going to be any partiality in the kingdom.!The Most High is not looking for darkness in his kingdom. The Most High got you Hunni! Keep pressing 😊 Amen 🙏
Shout out to Monique for saying this  for years none of you stood behind her shame on y'all!
This is bulshit she is the best at what she does. Hate to see her cry 😢 😭 😪 💔. Translate over sees 👀 I am in South Africa 🇿🇦 and I love your work Taraji hope you get your just deserves.
Black actors and actresses are underpaid, ion see folks like Leonardo DiCaprio and bad Pitt complaining
Black actors, directors, etc. need to start their own everything so that these Corporations need to pay them what they deserve based upon their popularity.
Keep it real SISTAH! BUT GAIL WHERE YOU AT???
Keep ya head up beautiful. We in this thing called coporate America feel the same way. My counterparts make 25 to 40 % more than me doing the exact same job...yes its true you do have to have other things going on. ❤
NO TARAJI, please don't leave us😩😩😩😂😂😂😭😭😭😭
God bless her and keep her 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
I remember when Richard Roundtree said that he got paid 5 thousand dollars for doing SHAFT!!! Yet they made millions off of it!!! Damn shame
I bet even her own people don't pay her what she deserves. They expect you to take even more of a pay cut
Taraji should definitely be a billionaire ! 💯
This is horrible 🙁 🙏🏾God has plans Taraji.
They just want to hold you down and keep you in this placed that they placed Black Actors in. That is why Monique was fighting so hard to get what she was supposed to get.
Leave then Taraji. Just walk away
Hollywood continues to lie about black talent not translating overseas. The three largest movie producing industries in the world from #1 to #3 are: Nigeria, India & USA (Hollywood). The first two alone are countries filled with people of color other than white.  Hollywood would have one think they are the epitome of movie making when they are conveniently in 3rd place. However, with its marketing & award shows to basically sell movie tickets, you would think that only American movies exist. In his heyday, actor Will Smith singlehandedly demonstratedBlack for a decade that a black actor could dominate the global market> And even then, Hollywood was saying he was an exception and that black talent didn't translate into profits overseas. Hollywood has been controlling the same old, tired narrative for decades. It's shameful & harmful to black actors financially & ethically.
My God! Enough is Enough! Lord ur still in the business of change, miracles, and blessings. You said first will be last, I claim that in ur name! This cycle has to break in your name. Our blessings are there with our name on it. Touch ur child from head to know, her faithfulness will prevail.!!
Gayle King’s interview style can be so annoying sometimes lol she never lets the person she’s interviewing get that complete thought out.
I teach my daughter that the true fight in life is to not let anyone still your joy and peace!! Put her faith in Jesus Christ everyday and watch her your enemies fall!!!
Mo’nique talked about this very thing, pay equity. The math ain’t mathin’…
Ms Henson are in my prayers for securing a victory over those who build walls of opposition to your creative energies, acting ralents/skills, full and equal  monetary income and positive goals.
This is so sad but true.
Why isn’t Denzel, Oprah,Will Smith,Sam Jackson,Tyler Perry,Quincy Jones, Chris Rock,etc..aren’t demanding for better pay for these actresses. They are only concerned about their own pay & not hurting their careers by speaking out.
Absolutely heartbreaking.
Let's address the elephant. WE must stand TOGETHER as PEOPLE and take care of US! Money will not  change how people feel and act. LAWS will NOT change how people feel and act. STRENGTH IN NUMBERS will change how WE act and feel as people.  Support US and stop killing US and I mean STOP killing yourselves and support others and stop bringing US down. Stop being mad at others when others are successful.  Stop being victims of your own circumstances!
I understand Taraji's frustration.  I have a Bachelors, Masters & Certificate and get no, after no when job hunting.   They tell you go to school get a degree, but I still can't get into my respective field.  Got all this student loan debt to be underprepared for the job market, what a joke!
The sameghing as Mo'nique said not being paid enough money and she has that right
Do you, do you.
The disparity in pay for Black women, in WHATEVER field, is absolutely deplorable!! We do so much, and are held at such a higher standard, for pittance!
I had no idea the payment structure for black female actresses was like Taraji explained.... unbelievable
This is a VERY important message just imagine so many Black African American people that are actors and actress that don’t speak out they just go along with the show and pretend everything is okay when it’s not!!!! 💔🙏🏾
Love this human ❤
Monique is the only celeb that has spoken out & named the companies that don’t pay black actresses properly. She had to sue Netflix to get property paid.Now, Monique is suing Paramount to get a piece of the profits of The Parkers.
if taraji is making good or more money from her other business ventures, she should leave the industry. or, she should continue to take occasional roles but focus on growing her $$ through business ventures.
She hasn’t looked happy this entire press tour. I’m not sure people understand how bad this really is. Taraji is incredibly graceful and private. For her to cry like this before the public is heartbreaking and concerning.
MONIQUE BEEN TELLING YALL FOR YEARS ,BUT THEY LABELED HER HARD TO WORK WITH . I AGREE WITH HER AND MONIQUE WHEN SHE SAID THAT WANTED HER TO PROMOTE PRECIOUS FOR FREE . AND NOT HERE IN THE USA BUT FLY OVERSEAS AND LEAVE HER FAMILY BEHIND.FIRST OF ALL NO ONE WORKS FOR FREE . AND SHE ONE AN OSCAR FOR PRECIOUS BUT ONLY WAS PAID 50K ...........ITS SAD HOW THE INDUSTRY IS GREED IS A TEERIBLE THING AND THE LOVE OF MONEY IS THE ROOT OF ALL THIS EVIL THAT YOU SEE GOD EXPOSING IN THIS WICKED INDUSTRY. EVERYONE IS NOT FOR SALE, AND THOSE THAT LOVE WHAT THEY DO , DESERVES TO GET PAID AT A FAIR LIVABLE WAGE EVERTHING GOES UP EXCEPT PPL SALARY IN ALL JOBS .BUT THE ONES THAT CONTROL THE NARRATIVE WILL ANSWER TO A HIGHER POWER.TRUST AND BELIEVE.
In Hollywood every dollar come with a price.
NOW do you understand the cries from Monique when she said this very thing 10 years ago, and nobody seen value in her defiance .......hmmmmm......isn't that the same language Taraji is saying today! smh
All facts it’s exhausting
This video brings to mind, all the calculated attacks on our black prime celebrities… wake up people!!!!   Now the new attack is on the celebrities that wants to buy BET. It’s just sickening.
Stay in the game Queen. Thank you from all women of color. We will Win with sisters like you in our lives. Thank You.❤
I remember Della Reese had this issue on touched by an angel they paid Roma downing more than her and she was a star of the show too and she had been in the business longer and brought more skills and talent to the show. They had her singing on the show  which should have been more money since she was a singer and actress. I think she took them to court and won.
American workers get treated like shit in most industries, it’s disgusting. Artists deserve better. Where would we be without entertainment? The billionaires can argue about not paying taxes when the people who work to put them in those positions live pay check to pay check. We must demand more!
Monique said it!!!
🙋🏾🙏🏾💯 What part of Revelation 5:5 and Revelation 22:2 talk about Poetry in North America then In the Beginning we are not from North America on The Tribe of GAD land looking for Equality or Universal Mathematics?
It’s okay.. follow your heart.
Tradition mentioned that actors are told that they don't translate overseas. Is it possible that hardest they work it isn't enough because a small thing that can be done in spare time if they have it. Learn   to. Speak.  More. Than.   Language, because that may be the Translation problem such as body language
Lady T. STAY in the game. God has your back. You are OUR Queen. I see you as an inspiration. We as a people will always give YOU LOVE and your flowers. Amen to❤
This is so sad. God is our Strength Sis. Don't Worry. Jesus have the Answer. We Black have your Back. You are talented not only for payments with Cash. You are our Hero👑💫⭐👏🌠💞🤲💃😇🙌🌹🥂
Girllll she need to do what she know is best for her! Her life her SOUL is more important than what she feel like. She has been seeming very emotional and down in all these latest interviews.
People didn’t want to accept this message from Monique how many years ago…
I felt that getting tired! Facts!
This is what Monique was fighting for way back with minimal support. Anither fierce woman of vision, resilience and power despite the lack of support in our community.
​ Shes upset because her community never supports her movies and without support she can't raise her asking fee... In order for any actor or movie star to receive the big bucks, said actor needs to have consistent success at the box office.. Taraji was the star of 4 back to back box office bombs recently.. Proud Mary, What Men Want, Acrimony and some movie in which she starred opposite of actor Sam Rockwell...  She had some false starts in the past with films such as No Good Deeds which was a low budget thriller from Sony/Columbia. I think that movie grossed about $35 million but it cost about $15 million to produce.     Halle Berry was smart way back in the early 2000s. Halle knew it was good business to line herself up with a super hero franchise and hope for box office success.. During that period, Halle had enormous box office success with Die Another Day and those X-Men movies. She had some mild success with a few films in which she was the lead.. Because of this success she received a reported $13 million for Catwoman.. When Catwoman bombed at the box office, Halle's asking price dropped but she continued on. She helped her visibility by continuing to be a spokesperson for Revlon and appearing on the covers of Vogue magazine..   You gotta get to the top..  Maybe Taraji needs a new agent?
I think the director just changed the subject completely. 🤔
Viola Davis has been saying this. Her white counterparts earn significantly more. We shall overcome someday.
She is such a light.  When I saw Baby Boy, I knew she had Next!  She is a descendant of Mathew Henson.  There is a special calling on her life.
Imagine geting a big opportunity like the Color Purple and still complaining....
I feel for this sista. 😢
It’s crazy how these black women know what it’s like in the industry but you’ll find them amongst the same group of people who band together to bring another hard working black woman down
she deserves ALL the respect. After I saw her in Benjamin Button I KNEW she was a acting gem and she definitely needs her due
I like what he said but I don’t appreciate the way he redirected the topic of inequality from taraji’s point
Like Mo'Nique was saying in the first place...
I feel her. Wholeheartedly!!!
I mean, I know this may seem off topic but has anyone notice how Rihanna hasn’t put out an album since 2016? And do people also notice that majority of wealth came from her products?! I’m sure Rihanna also went through the same situation where she wa doing all this touring, making all this music and not profiting off of it because of the amount of the money it takes to pay her team and probably so, unfair pay as well/residual. It’s happening to everyone.
Taraji is brilliant and as someone who has met her many times, She is truly LOVELY person. She has worked soo soo hard for a LONG time. She shouldn't have to fight like this. Bless Her.
We love you Taraji!! Your work is amazing!
I KNEW IT. She has a new love in her life soon as I saw her on sherri couple of months back I knew something had changed she's a much more calmer relaxed person she's at peace cause of that retreat she went on, she's sick of fighting and playing these toxic hetero roles and she's done with the homophobic industry cause I'm sure if she could play a lesbian 24/7 like Jenn beals and all these other white and half white ppl she would but us fully black lesbians always get the short end of the stick
I ❤ that you're explaining this the facts of the ""show business ""the truth the facts....👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼🙏🏼
They playin in our faces in all arenas.
You are a beautiful gifted woman. Thank you for sharing this. I didn t know. Systemic Racism is real. Grateful for your other endeavers. Jesus!❤
I am going to pray for her and the rest of our African American actors
It might be true that it doesn't play overseas because for too long the world has been accustomed to only one perspective.
Did she say $10 million and complain about it
Did she say $10 million and complain about it
I appreciate Ms Henson' authenticity. I relate to her feelings after having similar experiences. Stand tall, steadfast and resilient! These supremacists and their  system appropriates, steals and for generations continue to benefit from Black genius.  Pooling Black  resources and not depending on a system that steals our labor and genius is the solution.
I am so sorry about this and yes they deserve to get paid the same amount of money as the white actors do. No matter where you work at it's always favoritism going on
Is she saying that black actors aren’t paid equally as white actors? She needs to be clearer about that instead of crying about the irs taxing her $10 million bucks
Yes just because Hollywood has bad but there is ppl like Taj that just wonna act and entertain us alot of evil running round this world not what ya think ppll
Oh my goodness I feel for her., the entertainment industry is smoking mirrors 🪞, because there is nothing glamorous about the entertainment industry exspessully for Black Americans!✝️🙏💕
I hope Black Americans peeped what Taraji meant when she said exes are telling her that “they don’t translate overseas”.  That basically means that the new foreign Blacks in Hollywood have replaced Black Americans.  They’re deemed as more useful (down with the agenda); meanwhile, Black American culture is the premiere [Black] culture around the world.
The industry pays blk men 75% more than blk woman. That's why you see Octavia Viola Taraji playing multiple movies in one year. It's sad 😢😢😢
Taraji, please don't give  up. I am praying for you 🙏🏽
Yeah speak out let them know what there doing she is so humble different she don't play with those ppl it's messed up how evil the music and Hollywood is she's giving ya good stiff and under appreciated
It's down right  horrific.  I am not a actor nor actress but it's clear they go through what many of us go through.  In my career field I think about where I could have been career wise if I didn't have those around me keeping their grips on my shoulder, legs, and neck to ensure I don't get the opportunities nor promotion even with all my knowledge, skill, and talents.  As I watch others that have no skill, no knowledge, no talent surpass me!!  This life of racism is no joke.  It's a horrific nightmare for alot of us!!
It’s hard to work for any industry that predicated on lies. Every Network created black Shows increased their viewership and merged and released every show that was syndicated. Because they used black artists and audiences to gain a reputation and prominence but failed in sharing the wealth. Slavery at the highest level.  Food for thought. Every artist that goes overseas makes it big over there. Starting with Josephine Baker to our present singers who travel that circuit. The networks lie to maintain control. Every Country has been Urbanized by Black Culture, we have impacted and influenced a ERA that tries to mimic what they see in black media and how we are portrayed.  We are never shown to be the intellectual beings that we are but Thugs and Thots sell. Blackploitation movies from the 70&s only had us playing pimps and 304’s. Enough is enough we are the major consumers in all the world so let’s utilize our power and establish our own or boycott them that steals our rights and peace.
Gurl please..  Is she acting? She knows damn well in order to get the big bucks she needs to be consistant at the box office.. Name one film in which she was the lead and the movie was a huge box office success?  It was up to her and her agent to raise her asking price after she had a modest hit with 'No Good Deed'. Hidden Figures was Kevin Costner's movie.. Her fee did increase when she was on the Fox series Empire..  She needs to start a production company like many others have done and go out and find projects to produce and star in...  She had a lot of back to back box office bombs (4 in fact) recently.. Shes over 50 and I don't see it getting any better for her at this point.  Oprah needs to pull Taraji from this promotion tour because its not the time to speak on this..
I appreciate him trying to redirect but at the end of the day, Taraji P. Henson and other Black actors should be WELL PAID!!! Period. We are tired of fighting. We love you TPH. You got my husband crying over here. He said, “if y’all gotta fight so hard what does that say (as far as hope), for me and you?”
I totally understand Taraji feelings and it not just in the entertainment industry.
Monique tried to tell yall!
Hollyweird is done truth be told there aint no money theaters are closed us citizens will be affected they are angry with their employers if they quit hollyweird they will lose everything they think they have anyway they dont care about us everyday people let them cry
Monique said it FIRST (what Taraji said) but EVERYBODY clowned her and wouldn’t stand with her 🤷🏽‍♀️
I think COVID shut down Hollywood and actors/actresses don't have money like they used to have.
black people as a whole we still haven’t reached the top… but being a black women myself in engineering I totally understand. I had to get my masters to move to the next level but a man can move up to where I am with just a general degree. Black women have to work ourselves to the bone to survive in this world. It’s heartbreaking to see a Well known award winning actress say she’s tired of being treated second rate. Equal pay for the work has never been achieved for black women. You go home and cry because you work so hard. Taraji I feel you Sis and I hear you…..🙏🏽🙏🏽🤎😘🥰💯
She kept it 💯.
I’m tired too enough is enough
The Director totally missed the issue and talked around it. I am disappointed! It just proves Taraji's point. Do what you need to do girl. You know  your value and stand on it! Go where you are appreciated my darling! That doesn't have to be in the USA, so don't feel obligated. I know Taraji is sitting there with her gracious self listening to the Director go off on a tangent and not addressing what she said but she is cussing on the inside. Girllll do you!
I wish the new generation of Black actors in Hollywood would’ve learned from what happened to the Blaxploitation actors in the ‘70s.  Nothing has changed in that world, but Black people need approval and still think we can work in other people’s system and receive some sort of fairness and equality.  It will never happen.  I hate to see Taraji like this, but its been the same cry for generations.
When do we come to solve the bigger problems.💖
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. 🙏🏾🙌🏾
Black Queen don’t quit! Your latter days WILL be greater than your past❤🙏🏾
It time for these artists and actors to start talking about what is really going on behind the scene!! This hush hush thing needs to stop! Nothing will change until everyone start speaking up
She deserves flowers and more money
All you black kids wanting to get in an industry remember these talks
Love your work  taraji  you as  excellent as it get as actress  keep fighting for ones that coming behind you when they took awards from Angela Bassett she accepted it with Grace
When will we talk problem solving. It’s a problem that needs to be SOLVED. NOT JUST MORE OR VARIED BIZ PROJECTS.😢❤
Majority of the rest of the world is PEOPLE OF COLOR... duh they translate overseas!!!! WTF... everything black American's touch, turns to gold!
I was elated and excited to hear Taraji was tapped for this one.
#Hollywood pay black woman.  I can imagen it took much for Taraji P. Henson to disclose this.  #payTarajihermoney
It’s beyond ridiculous that an actor of her caliber has to still deal with the low ball, obnoxious, demonic behavior of Hollywood!!! She’s a super accomplished actress!!! CRAZY CRAZY CRAZY
Black Hollywood unite!!!!
😢
Do like some other actors when accepting a part. Make sure in your contract that each time the movie airs via any site, you'll receive proceeds every time!
Awe lawd! Being as OLD as I am…I just KNEW this. I’m devastated at hearing her have to say it out loud!!!  Dang it! The Math 😮just hardly ever is “MATHING”!  Taraji!!! You just gotta keep those OTHER balls in the air!
Oprah is the producer of the movie, and if there is no money for over see advertising blame her.
This makes me so Angry/Sad😢 But Defiant also, I have a 13 yr old daughter heading to a Arts high school next fall. She’s a very talented and exceptionally bright young girl. And I worry she won’t be able to pursue her dreams and be recognized for her talent… in every way  Equal pay, Equal recognition and Equal Opportunity!!!! Stay blessed ❤️❤️❤️
I have so much more respect for actresses, & actors, after hearing this. God bless you all🙏❤️🙏💙🙏❤️
I hope she does quit and live and do what makes her feel happy.     That industry and the music industry are corrupt, vile and evil..  This "culture" especially rap...needs to go.  It's NOTHING how it started....it has set us back 100 years.  Very instrumental in the destruction of us,  categorized as art and entertainment...but in reality brainwashing and programming our youth...leading them to their own destruction!!
Monique has been telling us this for years. It's time for African-American talent to band together to produce and distribute our own content.❤
👸🏾T.P.H. REFUSES to sell her SOUL!!!…I applaud and ❤️her for this…Continue being who you are and believing in YOURSELF!!!…#THECREATORMAKESNOMISTAKES🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🙏🏾
Not only Black Women.
I understand what's she saying. She is SO RIGHT!
This what Monique been saying
Lord help us all.
Same thing Monique was talking about.
No matter what T, we love you. Keep your head up.
It's not just the industry, it's any job.  NO one can survive in this time and age.  Like she said, the math ain't mathin".  Food, rent, gas, and utilities are going up, but no increase in pay/wages.  You can't even survive off the state required minimum wage.  Shit is crazy out here.
Wow, actors are now speaking out too! These celebrities be having their noses in the air like they not struggling like us all.
Yes very unfortunate the disperbrity is real the the entertainment industry look Hoda just go her pay rise Two years after working for the network for years.
Curious Case, Hidden Figures, Empire, What Men Want, Color Purple she has solid hits
When will these folks stop putting their faith in man instead of trusting Almighty God? 🙏🏾💕🙏🏾
MONIQUE BEEN SAYING THIS! 🤦‍♀️
Young man all that’s fine, but where’s the money reside
People also need to remember that they do not get paid for all this press promotion they are doing for the movie either. That’s hair, makeup, sercuity, flights, hotel. Etc that comes out if there pocket .
Totally agree with you 🙏
All black actors/actresses, writers, producers and directors should strike.
Don't sale your soul, you getting good pay better than one who's not acting. I understand and it's wrong, never the less your still blessed
This was real
Did she get top dollar in the color purple?
I feel the same about our reparation  money when are we are going to receive our reparation money like other people have received.  Wow this reminds me of what taraji p Henson said is what mo nique mentioned also about black balling this is so not fair
PTL Y’all…TPH, know we love you; the gate keepers know who they are, we suspect who they are 💯💌.
I’m ready for her to take over in business like Rihanna. Fuck the industry then if they are treating her like that
Pick people you love and trust. :) This was very inspirational and enlightened conversation.
We love you, Taraji. ❤ thank you for your honesty and transparency.  You are a Queen.  I know it's hard. But don't quit.  Please keep going! I know it's hard, but GOD will fight for you!!  You and our sisters have the victory in Christ Jesus! HE will break down the walls and barriers and bring justice to you and give you what you're due! The government is set upon His shoulders.  The industry is not bigger than God!  I KNOW you're tired! But I declare that the "joy of the Lord is your strength" (Nehemiah 8:10) in Jesus' name!  Hang in there, Taraji! God's got you!❤
This is what Monique the comedian is saying!!!! Thank you Black Queen 👸🏾
This is very sad that Taraji and many others black actress who work speak VOLUMES!  For the Industries still acting like Taraji, hasn't put her time in. Taraji,  work IS OF HIGH QUALITY she has to negotiate at the bottom?  That's disrespectful... Taraji, is an AMAZING ACTRESS!
Everything is about color when you removed the prejudice out of people black people can go far😮
Monique felt the same way and people put a bitter label on her, she was trying to rally us blacks together to stand up for fair pay, I felt Taraji's pain.
3.5Mil after 10Mil
I feel all of her pain and know she deserves to be paid TOP TIER! Don’t let’ ‘‘em break your soul Taraji, we LOVE YOU!!!!!!💐💐💐💐💐💐💜💜
I love Taraji she is one of my favorite actors and just people in general. I’ve always loved her transparency. She’s just real as they come the Dopest  ever.
We as a people gotta get these greedy people out of the industry.  Im so sorry because this LADY HAS WORKED HARD.  I pray she doesnt stop working.
It's  so so sad to hear her poor out her heart in such a way and still not be heard😢 like why must we work so terribly hard to get what our counter parts get so easily! To hear that we don't translate over seas is some BULLSHIT!!!! Not when our likeness,culture,attitude rather bad or good is being sampled.... They take the swag and our likeness and culture but don't  want to deal with us  or some of us..... So much flavor comes from us STOP THE MADNESS AND PAY THE ACTORS AND ACTRESSES THEIR DUES!!!
"The wealth of the wicked is laid up for the JUST, righteous, upright in heart." The supernatural wealth transfer is coming. Amen!
Hollywood been like this, props to the ppl that think they can change it.   They always find a new one next year
Winning we WON he said the only way when the RITUALS GOSE AWAY THE MONEY IS NOT BEING GIVEN BUT GAVE 😔
The wants are their the things they do no worth is notice the money is Growthnes for the Elites just because our Color BLACKNESS IS A THREAT YET OUR TALENT IS SORT AFTER BUT GOD SEE,S ALL 🙏🏾
My heart breaks for her and all the other black actresses in that same space. I’m so here for each of them getting their just due. 🥲 On another note…I’m fully aware that she was in the moment and all; but I really wish she would have said thank you to that nice lady for bringing her a tissue. “Thank You” goes a long way! 💙
Taraji shouldn't have had to audition for nothing that woman is a power house
Instead of being tired why not write her own script??she can get some clues from Shonda Rimes..women are too emotional indeed
Instead of being tired why not write her own script??she can get some clues from Shonda Rimes..women are too emotional indeed

That's a damn shame for as long as Taraji has been in the business. Though Monique was way too harsh in her delivery. It makes you really see what she was trying to say regarding how Black women are treated in the industry.
My sister my in take too you is to know when you're time is up every one has got a time limit and if you be positive think carefully you can move on and do other investments among each other and you all can make and be more happier. Blessed your heart
Buid your own. Look what Beyonce did and she owns everything.. She can will money out of thin air without even spending on promotion.
He said a bunch of nothing. He mentioned nothing about her being underpaid.
So just imagine what regular working Black women are experiencing.  This is not just Hollywood.  We are not learning anything new here.  We been experiencing this in everyday life but ours come with extreme harassment.  This is ordinary life for us day to day grind.
It is like this is Corporate America, too.  Everyone needs a side hustle.
She play the same role over and over
Taraji has put in a lot of work especially in the last 10 years
Gayle PLEASE let them answer the question without interrupting.
wow…this broke my heart.
😢😢, When will this end for black actresses and actor! Stop Hollywood.
Voila Davis  had something to say, about  this too. She's EGOT,, doesn't matter. The industry will not give blackness their so much  deserve props  It's all in the package pay it's revealed  Compare to others has not done half as much or good enough. You'll see the difference in what have you, in comparison and recognition. Morjority of black brilliancy in the Hollywood  industry  are resented , so not represented as important.
McDonalds, Target, Walmart, Giant Foods, Safeway, and Harris Teeter are all hiring.
I'd hate to see her gone.  There is no reason why artists should still be getting ripped off.
Monique been saying it for YEARS
Please don't quit Queen.... The love you generate amongst your fans will soon translate to dollars you deserve!!
😢🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
Taraji we love u are value keep going the beautiful lord gave u life in mighty name. It is written
I’d like to know who’s her representation?  It’s obvious she’s undervaluing her abilities.  In addition,  Africans or undermining Black American born actors ability to make a living.  We shouldn’t align ourselves with Black immigrants under any circumstances.  Why?  Our flight is not their fight because they consider themselves an “other”.  Hollywood is using them to replace Foundational Black Americans and will continue to cast them because they have disdain for FBAs.  Unfortunately, the majority of Black women were silent during Monique’s fight for equality.
I understand just how you feel. It’s sad we blacks work the hardest out of all groups and we get paid the less. As black women we are over looked for positions and money ain’t mathing. Our counterparts does not a damn thing and get paid for not a damn thing. I said what I said.
I like at foreign movies. The characters in the foreign movies emulate black culture, black words, black slang, black body movements. So how could the figures not translate in the foreign markets? How else are these people being so heavily exposed to black culture except by movies?
I have been working hard for all my life and never got the pay I deserve. I feel your pain as a woman. I can only imagine how it is for a black woman.
I worked for same agency, a younger man doing similar role and wasn't equipped for job so I helped him out, he was likeabke, found out he was paid 2/3 more than me.  No fault of his own who'd refuse a good, salary, imo.
Its not the industry...Its America..
Learning this and working on getting in the industry is letting me know what I may endure. I'm a writer and learning a lot from watching this video. I'm greatful for our people to be doing what they do!!! I truly hope none of them quit!!
We need to separate from these people
Pay the actors what they are worth. The contracts must be written so that the actors continue to benefit from the profits of their work. Fantasia talked about being broke while working on broadway daily. Taraji, take a break if you need to. Renew your soul and spirit but come back. I want you to remember what Ms. C. Tyson said about her body of work and how she lived during the later years of her life.
Another day in America
Tell it TPH....it's giving me Left-Eye, (TLC) vibes 😢🙏🏾🙏🏾
She is describing the Black American Female experience....it's exhausting! 😢
Taraji, is an inspiration for everyone.  I hope many wake up from anything she said, imo.  👵🇬🇧❤🌲
We love Taraji! God has given you a talent where most people can only dream of. Please continue to share your knowledge and experience with the world, the black community particularly. There is so much that happens behind the scenes that we are not aware of and know that we appreciate what you do! God has blessed us through you!!❤
It’s a shame because she worked on this film with an industry demon Oprah. I wish Taraji well
You are appreciated.
Do not quit. Do not quit.  Do not quit! Do not let the enemy snuff out the gift that GOD has embedded in you for all the world to see and glorify HIM. Keep fighting and together you and GOD win! Every day God gives you new mercy and new strength to keep fighting. You and GOD are more than the world against you. Keep marching forward. You are winning! Love you and praying with you. You are blessed and loved!❤
I love Taraji and I think she is an excellent actress but every since she spoke about pay when she did the movie with Brad Pitt, "...Benjamins"?? (can't remember title), I feel after that her career took a dive.  Some things may just need to be kept between you and God especially, sad to say when you are black and a black woman. Crying like this on tv looks victimy. I agree she doesn't get the recognition but let other people notice that, not yourself.
I felt this in my whole heart!! 😢 keep speaking up Taraji! God loves you! ❤ and be encouraged beautiful sis!!
This is the same message Monique was telling and they didnt want to listen and they labled her crazy.
I hear 👂 you Queen you have a lil  wealth .. we poor people understand..it’s just a different level of not being appreciated.. however Gail is like a untie that I don’t like ..
Tarjai, you did, God's work in this film. This film ministry to your soul. Your work here is priceless. Watch God add unto your life what money can't give. God bless you.❤
We all know why Hollywood is now low balling our black American actors
I hate to see her cry but at the same time glad she is not afraid to express the emotions. We are constantly bombarded with the phrase “strong black woman” and it’s getting demeaning. Yes, we know we are strong black women but that does not mean we don’t have a breaking point. It’s women in general that are underpaid, with WOC definetly getting it two fold. Ageism is another issue. They can’t wait to put you out to pasture yet white men 70-80 are sititng in Congress and not messed with. We know differently. Yes, she may have made 10 million like she said on a project but she broke it down. Now for that 10 million what did the male actors make? Let’s not forget the agents, PR people etc. We need more POC in executive positions, as agents etc. This is a problem in several industries. Be it publishing, finance, business in general. I moved abroad five years ago and the culture shock for me was how POC are received and acknowledged. My mental health improved ten fold once I stopped waiting for the other shoe to drop. Being treated like an equal human being was the norm. I may be returning at least part time in 2024 and with that comes a certain level of anxiety for all the reasons mentioned above.
I would love for T. to get a rich foreign man that worships her, for her to act for fun, and that she is super well compensated in the process. Black women work way to hard for what they are given.
You guys buy homes designer millions dollar cars extravagant vacations diamonds and everything under the sun. What you all don’t do as black entertainers is come together to own your own production companies nor to do you come together to buy your own distribution companies. It’s really in mature selfish and evil to live how you want walk pass people that support you guys and then want us to have y’all backs.  It takes one whole year for an average family to bring in 45,000 dollars to survive and y’all make millions so who really are the victims here. Regular folk work for companies that make millions and we get paid by the hr. Please make it make sense
Taraji deserves so much more and guess what?!! She’s going to get all of it. I’m here to watch!
Please don’t quite,start other businesses clothes/alcohol brands/make up line/ form ur own movies…..etc also overseas opportunities keep moving also go on sum of this companies boards just like wht people do all the time
Taraji is a phenomenal woman and Great actress! Taraji if it aint worth it do what best for you! Do your businesses and only jump on a roles that align with your morals and financially benefits you.
Please Taraji don't let the industry break you. I definitely feel you. Stay strong sis. I hope you don't quit we love you so much.
Taraji needs to headline a Netflix or Hulu series.
This is our reality
This is REAL.
Lord my prayer is that you will make this women a billionaire in her side businesses and that she will treat Hollywood like Rihanna treats the music industry 🙏🏽 IN YOUR NAME Amen
Taraji the realist PERIOD!
This is heartbreaking.
This is so sad Blessing to you all ❤❤❤❤
This is occurring within every industry.  It is an expression how "color" is continually glossed over and then randomly selected to be chosen for opportunities that occur selectively. Advocates are still needed to open doors or to re-"present" what is already known.
They don't  nothing but use us smh
You will be missed 😮 my sister
Hold on my people, we at the red sea....he sees what we going thru. Long as you walking right, change is coming.
I'm feel safe bad for her Brilliant and Beautiful Queen stay strong Sis  we love you so much 😢❤❤
Wow I thought she was getting Paid Paid...SMH
Awww love you Taraji!!!! You are such a brilliant artist!!!! Capitalism is not fair or just.
Monique been saying that,
Stop spreading misinformation or false information about this actress she is starring in the color purple it’s being released dec 25th Christmas 🎄 day there more she is doing?
Also, we are not here to please and conform and to surrende our lives and souls to the powers that be.  These powers are searching their own lives trying to figure what's going to happen in the next minute and second. WE are  on this earth  to let people know YOUR God is real and powerful through All of the struggles we went through and we're able to be in the powers to be faces, and tell them, they have NO POWER,  but God!
I Love you Taraji; I Understand 🌹😔💫❤️
Why are Black Women In the Arts and in General Paid the Least?  And When will it Change?   Thank You Teraji for Portraying these Great Rolls. Hold You Head Up and Keep Speaking UP.  NO ONE Do the Math. Thank You for Giving, people  dont  know what  it takes to produce/ACT a Movie/ Play.
That's What Monique Was Fighting For!!!!
I love TPH. I hope she gets sorted out. She is undervalued.
I wonder what Oprah paid her for this movie.
Hey listen i am a writer but I refused to  come out and let them do me like that i see what they do i would love to share some of my stuff but no way not till things change and i mean that.
RESPECT YOURSELF TARAJI
Monique told y'all. 👁️
This made me cry. We really don't think about what others are going through when it comes to their careers. Unbeknownst to many you suffer from abuse from your career. When you love something and when you are great at something you want to continue to do it. At times the same career you love can bring you displeasure and pain. I can relate, you wonder is this worth fighting for. At the end of the day you must chose yourself. I wish her well and peace with her desicson.
Hang in there Queen!!! We love you and support you!!! ❤️
We love you Taraji!
#Monique  Stand together or fall.
Unless you in the bed making up the bed sheets sounds like you get nowhere😮
I want the interviewer to stop cutting them off! GAT ZAMN!😰🤫
I know money is sooo important in life, but whatever you do, you must do it to the glory of God , because if you think man is going to look out for you and treat you fairly and righteously, you will be mistaken!  This is WHY and always, that whatever you do I life, perform, practice and DO IT, to the Glory of God, and He only will reward, because He knows and love you, and He will keep your mind in Perfect peace if your mind is stayed, trusting, believing, and surrendering on and to God/Jesus our savior.
ALWAYS KNOW YOUR WORTH
The gatekeepers kept you down if you not playing the game if you know what I mean😮
Taraji ❤
TPH ❤
you are so right Taraji, but  don't gave up if will happen for you❣✌🏾🙏🏾
If people would stip BOOTLEGED AS WELL THIS WOULDN'T HAPPENE! THEY SPEND HOUR'S AND DAYS AND YEARS IN THE STUDIO AND GET NOTHING! this is heartbreaking 💔💔💔
This needed to be said to help others open up and speak out   about not getting paid enough for their work as an actress or actor especially Black women and men. Monique being saying this, and people were thinking she was a problematic 😮
This is horrible.  Our beloved Queen Taraji deserves so much more than that & I hate the thought of her leaving.  They are lying about us not translating overseas when 9/10ths of the world is people of color.  Africa alone is a humongous untapped market.  They are marketing to the wrong people.  This is also an opportunity for us to serve that market & make those $$$’s.
I LOOOOOOOOOOOVVVVVVVEEEEEE SEEING YOUUUUUUUU TARAJI - on the big screen and I’m 10000000% sure there are millions of like me.  Please don’t be pushed out!
I Concur. This goes for All Of us.
And the powers that be, doesn't care for the tears.
It’s not your what you’re worth…it’s what you negotiate. You can always say no or create your own lane.
It's probably not Hollywood, It could be your agent. You should have your agent checked out. Is it a diversity agent, how is the negotiation techniques. Maybe you have outgrown your agent. They might not have the ability to take it to a higher level as your portfolio climax. Be blessed.
I meant no harm or disrespect in the things I’ve said to anyone, it’s just my personal perspective and it’s coming from a place of Love only ❤️
Taraji we’re watching all the way from Europe!! We love you over here!!
How long should we be at bottom ???
That's exactly what Mo'Nique was saying.  And no one stood up and backed her. And Oprah & other powers (how ironic) silenced her or tried to. Here we are almost 10yrs later the fight is coming circle.
With all the goings on (allegedly) within and surrounding the industry. To Ms Taraji and others with similar and other negative stories. Sometimes it’s just best to walk away. That’s the quote sold to us regularly folks everyday all day, walk away. Does that not go for a higher status as well?? Being combative because you’ve worked so hard Respectfully and just plain deserving, for others it’s the greed maybe from not having. Maybe so, but sometimes we need to change our paths. whilst you still have your life, health, sanity etc…The Respect, Wages, Credits etc all that’s desired, come with a very, very high price. Is all of that worth losing a little bit of your true self with each achievement, as it pertains to the individual?? I REPEAT…in some cases; there is lost of life, health, sanity etc…even more, your SOUL… All that Keep Forgetting to Remember, the more you receive…  “ONE DAY HE IS COMING TO COLLECT!!” If ya know-ya know  Sending Prayers for us all 🙏🏽
Isnt this what monique was saying
We love you Taraji, you are there for a reason and a purpose!!
Unbelievable and very heartbreaking to watch. This woman's resume is extraordinary, to say the least and to watch her still have to fight just to get what she has more than rightfully has earned... SMH.. UNBELIEVABLE.
Wow this is so sad I never knew she wasn't getting paid the value of her work she's is an amazing actress. Stay strong my sister your time is coming you will be rewarded for all the hard work you've done. I declare it in the name of our most holy righteous God  amen 🙏🏼
Oprah pay your people.
Why is she just now talking about this? She been in the business since the 90s. She is not quitting acting,  then she'll have to get a real job like the rest of us.
I love her she is a inspiration to all our African queens. She is a damn good actress and she should get what she is worth. Ms. T.P. Hanson hold your head up  because you are a beautiful black queen and a role model for us all l have much respect and love for you❤❤
Wow that was so real and impactful and Taraji is right. my heartbreaks for her because she does work and it's sad that she has to go into negotiations with whomever does the negotiations for their salary feeling like she hasn't broken all the glass ceilings that she has broken.❤
You have to let the people know. Everything that glitters ain't gold.
Respect
Start making your own movies and post it on YouTube, we will watch!!!! And subscribe! We love you
What has Monique been saying 🤔
Ms. T is speaking the truth. Because Mrs. Viola Davis stated the same issues within the film industry is happening to her and other female women of COLOR.
Trano this is your purpose and God is going to reward you. I believe you're going to be blessed awesomely from this movie. Don't give up,!
Love this women… she speaks truth!!!
Wow..I felt that Taraji..Don't quit God gave you this assignment.
Producing is were the money is at.
Hmmm… seen a video clip recently during the promotion of TCP and something seemed off between her and Oprah.  This may have been it.
I feel her pain and frustration- keep going sister
her credit card must have been declined or something...
The gentleman on the panel is trying to take a positive spin on a messed ups situation. Enough is enough.
Not translating overseas is also BS. Why did ateave Harvey take his family feud to Africa then?
It tells me you are human & as a black woman you don’t matter in America! I’m feeling in the regular world of professional black women ❣️
Hopefully, she can do something else, then bc its hard out here to make ends meat.  I just spent 140$ on food that should have cost 65$ its ridiculous
The issue is this predatory economic system called capitalism.
Didn't the actor strike like the writers???
This is the ugly side of being in the creative space. It’s a struggle because like she said, you’re not doing it by yourself. And they don’t work for free. And it’s always been a tenant of any industry to not discuss salary or compensation.   Why do you think that is…..ask yourself.
Also sounds like someone needs to change their agents. Who is negotiating these contracts??
Monique was 💯% correct when she decided to speak on this issue...💪🏽
The truth is pending in her case … let go and see how it works out
Is that the lil kid from Boomerang?
I think she is depressed. She maybe menopausal.
I'm Actress and I know what she is talking about 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Lord, bless this cast for the barriers you are allowing them to break, hearts from the performance that are being repaired, dreams that have been restarted, and most of all give each of the cast members a huge financial breakthrough their fare share for the hard work put forth just as their white counterparts are being paid even the more.  In Jesus name IT IS SO!  Do It Jesus like only you can.....Amen
Why has so much space in the presence of  non existent roles by people that had you waiting behind the veil ?  Hand me another brick 🧱..laying upon each other.. 9:08
May God continue to bless you   Queen always and forever 🙏🏼 ❤️ 🎉
Babyyyyy when I tell you I feel every last OUNCE of this!
Mo'Nique has been saying this for years.
🤔 the willingness to become humble* regardless of how it feels in the moment, she is submitting a deposit 😜goes along way… God must got his hand in something it sounds like of course 🤣🤧🥳
At this point nobody really cares bout what ya do in that industry. Youu know what they signed up for..
There is a strange energy surrounding this new ‘The Color Purple’. Suddenly Taraji is thinking about quitting acting during this production is somewhat off putting.
This what people don’t see about Hollywood. 🙏🏿 Taraji I love you. I love your brand.  🙏🏿
I completely agree with Taraji , the industry is messed up and just the job market with not paying what people deserve. She's one of the best actresses being disrespected & paid peanuts. Uncle Sam are thieves! The government don't care for us because they want and need for us to work multiple job/gigs so we have no lives just working, paying bills while they sit on their azz collecting money for doing nothing. These production companies wouldn't have anything if it was for hard working actors such as Taraji P Henson.
I’ve watched the original no less than 20 times. So I’m hoping that this one will give me the same feeling.
T keep ya head up and leave it to God. Because he has something way better in plan for you. Trust it.. ❤❤❤
They are using you all!
ENCOURAGE  HER! AMEN!
This is some serious stuff i thought they were Super Millionares left me  breathless.
Judge Judy gets 400,000 a day!! Juge Mathis gets 23 million??? Huge difference.  The math isn't mathin.
Love you, Taraji! 🤍
@Tarjiphenson……………Thank You😪😪😪😪😪😪  This has resonated DEEP for me personally. Dear God…cover this Sister SPIRITUALLY, give her the ARMOR to drive this journey for of us who watch from the sidelines, keep her steadfast and unmovable to stay the course in this LIFETIME  - Ameeeeeen😪♥️🙏🏽💐  Love ya Sis🫶🏽
Amen! The world is RACIST! LOOK HOW THE TRYING TO PUT TRUMP BK IN OFFICE!
Isn't this was Monique was saying all the time
They Lying. International fans know you and LOVE you guys, seeing people like US on screen is appreciated....I'm from the Caribbean, we follow you guys.....African Americans are KEPT back to ensure they DON"T RISE.
Love you Taraji Keep God First my sister ❤ he's the only one you should worry about your recognition is coming from..... the people in the industry is for self no matter who you work for..... another production group make  pay you more, to show you they appreciation your work, but they still walk away triple the amount you will ever be able to walk away with.... thats why they are billionaires i don't care if white or black they just do it different.Taraji u paved the way, don't worry.  Me personal they will never pay u your worth thats wat separate you from them I don't care who they are. God is the only one who can give you wat you worth im not saying u but people period....stop looking for a man's/women, validation they would never give you what you deserve or worth thats why it hurt. Even black production they just do it different and the more you make the more they take...... that's why living a certain lifestyle it requires a lot...I wish you well BEAUTIFUL Taraji YOU DESERVE ALL YOUR FLOWERS ❤❤❤❤❤
Don't give up! That's what they want! I understand  but the enemy ALWAYS  ATTACKS AFTER VICTORY!
Not only the industry stealing your soul, but the IRS is stealing people money to, they don't even work for it but they are getting half of what people making, when will it end.
This lady is TIRED. I felt her. No matter what, when you’re getting treated differently and you know you’re working hard and GETTING PAID less…That will break you..   Edit: a lot of you guys are missing the point. regardless if she’s a millionaire or not…when you’re not getting paid what YOU’RE worth and less than your YT counterparts you will be affected. A lot of yall seem upset that these celebrities are mad about their pay but it’s their money…You would be mad too if the shoe was on the other foot.
Greedy
This is sad ! She should be a millionaire by now ! She put in the work and we seen her put it in . This is a soul snatching industry.
I pray that you get everything you deserve Queen 💗 Thank you for everything and all of the entertainment you participated in we are blessed with.
You need a good pr person and a good lawyer negotiator for you that’s gonna be more important than the team
Omg Omg wtf is she talking about y’all some greedy demons!!!! What the hell about the working class.  This chic really sitting up her crying wow wow wow
Wow. Taraji was real. I felt that. 😢😊
POWERFUL
So sad, that this people are underpaid for their hard work.
Monique was talking about pay equity years ago.
Fame cost ! She is very talented and should consider diverting her energy in another area of her life …..Look at the body of work that she has put out and she appears devastated…. I am 🙏🏿 praying for you Taraji
Everyone should listen to this woman's message. We all feel the pain of what Taraji is saying. I work in corporate America and in a field where not many people look like me. I felt the strain in her voice, the exhaustion! I have to mentally prepare myself each day to deal with the mess.
Guys … I have seen a lot of comments saying “Monique said this a long time ago” This conversation did not start with Monique. It started with Lena Horne, Ella Fitzgerald and many more before and after them within music and movies. This has been a struggle for decades. Im certain they are all trying to to push the envelope to fairness. It’s BEEN a problem across the board.
Y'all a**** should have rallied behind Monique when she was saying the same thing.  But no, y'all thought she was crazy.  Oh well, do what you gotta do
I feel like she feel now. I’m tired!😢
I love how passionate Taraji’s ALWAYS been about black women in entertainment getting their due. It’s coming!  And for the non-nuanced thinkers saying “she’s making x million what’s she crying for?”’. She works in a multi billion dollar industry where she’s see ppl doing the SAME job making 2-4x more money, not having to audition 3-4x for roles while Chalamet didn’t do anything for Wonka, and then told that she (and black ppl In general) won’t translate to overseas audiences. It’s about fairness and she’s proven she’s talented and bankable. Why should she be quiet about unfairness? By that logic, working class ppl shouldn’t fight for equal pay, unions or benefits either. Fight on Taraji!!
Its the billionaires that own everyone so they'll keep you on the bottom while they are getting rich.
Know what people in the real world do when they think their employer doesn't appreciate and compensate their work? They quit rather than complaining that the white co-worker gets paid more. Fire your agent or leave the industry because you are crying over being paid millions. Rather than riding out this new found success, both you and Fantasia are running around "crying racism". I get that it exist but timing is everything - Your movie is about to premiere so why divide and alienate now?!!
Has anyone else noticed she’s looked completely tapped out during all of the promo? I wonder if this is why
Monique beeeeeeeen saying!!!!!! It's time to rally behind each other and stand your ground.
I’m with you Taraji. You are a great actress 😢❤ the movie industry would be nothing without our amazing talent black actors and actress. Love ❤️ you guys
👑 Taraji, We ❤ You 🥰 and hope that you keep on acting and get the pay 💰 🤑 you deserves because you are an extraordinary actress 🎉 Thank You 🙏🏽for sharing your talents with us, it's so good to set some boundaries, I know that  industry is hard to deal with, they build you up and Chop you down in a matter of seconds regardless of how  great  you are especially when you have integrity and morals, it's much harder for you behind the seems, Stay Real 🙏🏽 ❤/✌🏽
Girl BYE 👋 😂 Cicely Tyson !!! Hello !!  These other Women are not on that level . Tarajee is cool but most of the others are over hyped and lame.   They dont like love or care about us ???
This sad how these actors an singers have to get dogged just to have fame an live good naw i want let that happen to me naw❤
Ill leave to be put in this kinda of situation that i be hearing naw it aint even worth it i rather open up some business rather be doing all that mess ❤
Hearing this Taraja it was a good thing Beyonce wasn't in this movie. Just imagine what you would have been left with and Taraja is a better actor...
These issue a seem deeper. I think she should habe had speech training  earlier I can see some of These producers  saying  she sounds ghetto
The entertainment industry has used indigenous black people in the worst ways. Firstly, they’ve  stolen everything from our ancestors, our land wealth & Identity (indigenous aboriginals, the first Americans, the American Indians, the people from which all comes from) and make our people do all kinds of unthinkable, sometimes criminal & demeaning acts to get what really belongs to them/us in the first place.
This is why they should’ve joined forces with Monique a few years back a lot of them just left her out alone
Leave that filthy industry and PREACH THE KINGDOM OF GOD!!!!!!!! At the end, that's all God will honor!!!!!!!!!
Aw..that's sad. I thought that Taraji was getting good money by now. Black women are underpaid in all industries and it's sad. As hard as she works she deserves to get what she deserves. That industry ain't right..God is watching..😡😩
Is this not what our very own Monique was talking about when she stated that her resume or her body of work she put in should be enough to get her paid  what she's worth. Monique was taking a stance for the young black girls that was coming behind her too... And not only did the power that be put her down but, her very own community of people slammed her and her husband Sydney for taking that stance... While Oprah Winfrey the imposter and cancer of our people refuse to even acknowledge her... The same Oprah that has put her own self over a project that she wasn't even the lead in... to not even acknowledge Whoopi at alone is blasphemous... Oh and Let's not forget Tyler Perry and Lee Daniels as well who helped Oprah put our own sister down like she was nothing or worth anything and Black Ball her when they all knew she was telling the 100% truth? Ijs...
Monique been saying this...
Thank You Taraji ❤
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Powerful 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Monique BEEN saying this!
@taraji the absolute, unequivocal answer is ownership.  You’re headed in the right direction.  One brick at a time Sis.   It isn’t fair, but you have EVERYTHING you need inside to turn that frustration into winning.  If I can do it in corporate, you can too.
Isn’t it interesting how so many black actors are saying the same thing Mo’Nique was saying years ago? Her approach probably rubbed people the wrong way but what just listen to what she was saying was true.
So why don't they support Monique when she speaks up about these issues???????
Hollywood is hell!! Racism, harassments, rapes, bullying, low pay for some, non acknowledge of talent..... one opportunity, get the paycheck and go invest in something else!!
Structural barriers, sad 🤔
Hear tears could be her expression of anger. We all know our beautiful Brown people are under valued in all aspect of this life in America so sad and sickening
I don't know If I want to be rich anymore, I mean damn everybody I thought was filthy rich..... This is just sad
The biggest lie ever told is black people don't translate overseas. How is that possible when their style, culture is always trending in pop culture people all over world love african American and black american people. Its time for them to own their own stuff and self distribute honest coz thats a damn lie 😒.
Love love loooooove Taraji 👏🏽💙
❤..... It doesn't make them special. You deserve every penny. You are too much!!!!!! 😇
she's complaining about making 3million per project ? wtf people are starving
I hope black America truly begins to stand up for equal pay. This happens across every industry. Corporate, business. Non profit,  acting,  service,  music. It doesn't matter.
She sound just like many of us middle class/working poor folks! But, refuse to do anything about it. It’s ashamed that these Celebrities don’t understand how much power they have to make a huge difference for everyone.
Ummm stop trying to live beyond your means,i think thats part of a lot of their problems ijs
She said it best on Empire. " I'm tired of getting crumbs and begging for what's rightfully mines"  She wasn't getting what she deserved then. Will the unjust ever change. SMH
She's a great actress! I feel her tears 😢
Proud Mary is a 2018 American action thriller film directed by Babak Najafi, from a screenplay written by John S. Newman and Christian Swegal. The film stars Taraji P. Henson, Jahi Di'Allo Winston, Billy Brown, Danny Glover, Neal McDonough, Xander Berkeley, Margaret Avery, and follows an assassin who must look after a young teenaged boy after a hit job goes wrong.
This angers me!
We understand and are in total agreement. To work so hard and be undervalued and unappreciated wears on you. We appreciate and love you, Taraji! ❤
How much Does Denzel Washington earn for each Equalizer Movie?.
Poor Taraji. And she is one of the best actresses. Who said she doesn't translate overseas? She is a huge star all over the world. They are robbing her and lying to her.
She's correct it will steal your soul Satan world True Christianity Jehovah says "my kingdom is noo part" you are working for richest. I admire your tenacity but you're putting your efforts in the wrong place.
Better start investing
7:18 "u gotta choose right" was a sneak diss. T.P knew it was to that's y she waved him off. He with that man crew that's downing women.
I feel so bad for her. Lord have mercy. It's these men doing it as women we have to band together and not split w the men but with women.
Monique said this a long time ago but no one wanted to listen🤷🏽‍♀️
It's about time that we take BACK. What is OURS!!!!!! THEY are receiving more for OUR talents!
Black people need to break away from all those people that Kanye talks about
That Industry is terrible they made a fool out of them peoples
But still you make a lot of money just to entertain people.  I get the unfairness bc we all can experience this in our own lives. It's just tone deaf due to people unable to pay every day bills
That industry is evil when it comes to their "slave" contracts!  I've heard many in that industry (actors/singers) cry the same tears!
Thank you, Taraji, for keeping it real. Everybody sees the glitz and glamour, and wants the same thing, too, without knowing the whole truth. Be encouraged, Sis.
Considering Oprah Winfrey whose a billionaire produced it maybe she should have opened up her pocketbook a little bit more.
U'll never b rewarded...
Y'all need 2 pray wit the belief n Jesus Christ 2 change the industry All power and might iz n his hands The prince of the air and hollywood iz satan I'll never b rewarded according 2 ur worth unless U sell ur soul God has a plan 4 ur life thru Jesus the Mesiah and soon comin King
That's a real one ,right there. Strength to this Lady
We definitely love you But as an Educator we are unseen undervalued and disrespected!!!! Education is the Most Important job in the entire world and without Us where would the world be!!! So let’s fix this profession first!!!! Cause we don’t get paid AT ALL when we leave it ON THE LINE EVERY DAY!!!
Sometimes it helps to take a break.
This is heartbreaking. The other sad thing is as a writer no matter how talented you are sometimes it's almost impossible to get past the gatekeepers.
I'm so glad Beyonce was not cast as Suge. Her acting is not the best.
❤❤🙏🏾
Taraji is going to create something so magnificent that might even help people. That wouldn't happen if the pay was right. Perhaps she's supposed to have these side hustles. She's creative and needs to create. Pay isn't happening to her; it could be that it's happening for her.
When Mo'Nique was out there saying the EXACT SAME THING all the black women should have rallied behind her. They let her stand out there on her own and look crazy.  Also take your own money and write and produce your OWN stuff.
I hear you tarahji what the hell is so wrong with being fair to people it's just plain old Evil the Selfishness of white supremacy needs to stop what's the point of constantly trying to  traumatize black people for what ? It's Sick why does it bother white people to see people of color HAPPY OR COMFORTABLE.???? At the end of day we all are  going grow old and  die and end up on a steel slab with a toe tag in a morgue  Be you white or black rich or poor the great equalizer. DO better life is to short do good because Karma is real and that's a great equalizer too . Kindness is a natural human trait use it .
I really felt her pain
It's a new day coming! Hold on .
I understand I wish they would pay people fair wages💰 what they are worth that’s my prayer❤❤❤

Monique been saying this for years but nobody wanted to stand with her
I’m in tears hearing your story Taraji.  Huge fan in Australia. Please keep making movies!  I have to wait til the end of January before we can see it in Australia.  I’m going to the first show wearing my purple
Don't cry God see you and your work You will get your reward on earth as it is in heaven real soon. Stay prayed up don't forget
🤔🗣️ Didn't she just do the color purple
She's brilliant and definitely doesn't get the recognition and pay that she deserves ! Please don't quit Taraji. The World needs you
I appreciate her realness and her breaking it down about this black actress industry
I love Teraji ❤️
I totally understand her feelings, but the acting world needs her.
They actually translate everything I've seen from Tarahi, in Spanish. She's gracious and talented., and that's also truth.
I hope she doesn’t quit.
I get it.  That’s crazy for them to say black actors don’t translate but you can send idris and etc come shooting American made movies. Bull shit. They would not pay Angela Jolie that shit.
After reading these comments. Y’all don’t know this but black women work 10x harder in the entertainment industry. Taraji was making $175,000 episode and Terrence was making $325,000. And he complaining about his pay. 😂 She was the main character on the show and the views was higher than big bang theory.  She would have to make 6 episodes of empire to make one episode of big bang theory salary. Angela Bassett makes $450,000 per episode on 9-1-1 make her the highest paid black women on television in 2022 😒while white women was fighting for $600,000 -$1 million back in 1998. Black women never get treated right in television industry. And they both was on top tv shows in America.
I can’t even afford to go to a movie.  Yet yes, I completely understand how it feels to be undervalued, unseen, and not appreciated.  Love you Taraji.
Say she gets 10 million, but she nets 2 million.  That is still 2 million dollars!!  Almost everyone in almost every industry works hard for a fraction of what she makes. She's not gonna act, then what she gonna do that will give her millions like that?!  This is rich people problems.
Revenue created = pay.....they just don't get it...since their "skill" CANT SELL..ie.... PUT THE BUTTS IN SEATS........they blame it on race.  Accountability is the kryptonite to those with no character...
I feel her. I think showing sadness vs anger is really powerful.
Their Team is usually:  Hair Stylist Make-up Artist Wardrobe stylist Agent / Manager Personal chef Personal trainer  Accountant Bodyguards Family members Friends  Sadly A lot of celebrities don't trim the fat on their "staff" until their in severe debt. Agents do a disservice to their client for not negotiating residual income.
She dont sell tickets. Its always the victim mentality. People like that are wrote off immediately,  by peers, the public, by everyone.
She tell the truth it's sad how they do the black peoples I understand how she feels they don't want to pay her right but yall get mad at Tyler Perry he pay what you worth that how it suppose to be I wish all my black sisters and brothers the best
My heart is with her❤i love you taraji ❤❤
