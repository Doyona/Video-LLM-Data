Idk why people be so mad the girls touching him. He literally wants to it’s for the music video and he is 16, in some states the age of consent is 16 so if he is in a state where it is 16 he is allowed to be touched
Notti would be proud

WHERE DID MABU COME FROM😭😭
Bro all y'all tripping talking bout they got grown ppl twerking on him first if it was a problem he wouldn't have done it and most likely some of them are js girl w hella makeup on pluss it only one girl twerking on him the rest kinda feeling on him hyping him up at points y'all leave him alone dis shit smack 😂 y'all to bother ice spice bout dat shit bro
I woke up and do the best you know negative masses in arena, superman the kitchen, matinee, and look at my best
The poor phone falling 😂😂😅😢
The male ice spice with that grah
Grown ass women doing the video with this young nigga is sad, bitches will fuck an infant if it was rich and that’s saf
This nigga 16 years old in this damn video and you can’t be 21 yrs or older to drink or drive or smoke? wtf
Although DDOsama is very charismatic and I kinda like how he sounds and think he is talented , I am dumbfounded seeing how this is not going viral for different reasons. If a 15 year girl was put in a music video where she’s sexualized and dancing on men, this would be an outrage. There is no other way of putting it other than the blatant hypocrisy. How old are the dancers twerking for him ? No matter what the answer is, it is disgusting. And the fact that this can be put on YouTube and pushed into the mainstream ? And why is Coi Leroy, a grown woman, engaging in and promoting this kind of behavior, and no one is saying anything? Who is even taking care of the kid since he is still a minor? How is it acceptable to use a child to glamorize a lifestyle that probably gave him a lot of trauma for money ? Because we all know they are not smart enough to even know what they’re signing. There are so many things that are wrong about this but the worst part is how people choose to turn a blind eye and act like this isn’t insane. What the fuck.
They say big f***ing a lot bugging a lot is his favorite learn to say that’s like his catchphrase in dead ops he said that, and they Osama song he said that everybody is saying bugging
🔥🔥🔥🔥
What’s the girl in the pink @

dang so fire like ong
Here before he blows up 😊
On god
I didn’t know lol mabu was in there
Bro really made it
Jeez, this is degenerative.  Poor kids thinking this is worthwhile.   In all fairness, none of these folks have a future, or a skillset.
Not to long ago, mabu and dad made a song called “throw”. In that song, mabu said “I started doing good and got more enemies.” Now, dd has a situation with DDot and deeplay4keeps and they don’t seem to be happy with eachother because dd allegedly  “left them behind”. Sugar hill y’all gotta figure y’all stuff out bc y’all have a bright future ahead of y’all.
why is it always the black ppl.
Ice Spice type beat tho am i wrong:/
🔥
I’m your biggest fan
This kid is gunna go places 😊

To all my brothers and sisters in Christ advancing God's Kingdom, please know that God sees your work for His Kingdom. Don't let anyone discourage you. What you're doing is right and good. Just make sure that your spreading of the Gospel is in love, no matter what. Y'all will be in my prayers. Jesus Bless ❤️🙏
The Gospel:  (I am not a bot, I'm just someone who enjoys spreading the gospel. Much love to you all!)  The gospel is the good news that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died for our sins and rose again, eternally triumphant over His enemies, so that there is now no condemnation for those who believe, but only everlasting joy.  Peter says in 1 Peter 2:24, “He himself bore our sins in His body on the tree, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness.”  So Christ died not only to forgive sin, but also that it might die in the lives of His people.  ~Quoting John Piper~  ALSO My friend put together a great PowerPoint about the Gospel and Jesus being the prophesied Messiah.   I'd like to share if you're interested, just reply and I can send you the link.  May Jesus Bless you!
This dude sucks no cap
Yo when did Bin Laden start dropping music
The sad thing about DD is that he got up cause of Notti's death but he is true talent
Imagine if those girls were boys and they were touching little girls….

Molly hactchit
like jackie underneath me said about DD OSAMA so u telling me that it's okay for ddosama to be tryna hook up with girls older than him but it would be a problem if it's the other way around 😕 just sad
Problem is he’s underage when grown women touching on him and no one sees a problem with it Now we need a video reverse with underage girls 15-17 getting touched by grown men then y’all see how fucked up and upside down this is 🤦🏾‍♂️
Music is GARBAGE these days. This is just another example.
