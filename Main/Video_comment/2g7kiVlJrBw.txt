what’s this? 👀 -> https://youtu.be/r49BShq-x28
If i see one more noob pro hacker video with the hacker one being just harder than pro im gonna go jump off a cliff with the boys
Totem was already in hotbar  I challenged you Please try again   this totem clutch was not difficult about me
If i clutch with the water bucket i will die because i don't have the ability to clutch
All of these are super easy man
Expert is better than hacker
I can do the woter cluch
Hacker hahahahahaha where's the hack thing?
Mai hota to direct pani mai kuud jata🕶✌
Did u know MLG and clutches are'nt same thing
all of that to easy
I can do ALL of these
I am a god I can do ladder clutch like nothing
Wat wow
3 if u ugjevjjsjvgjdh 2 x. K3j ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😳😳😳😳🙏🙏🙏🙏🤔🤔🤔🤔
That high mlg is not just beginner.
Why the hacker was easier then pro
Me when I try to clutch: My luck: "so... Why on earth did you think it was a good idea to k*ll y0urs3lf!?"
not dream just crafting a boat midair-
If this audio was a person i would stab it 1 million times... I've heard it a million times
That's not hacker thats                 Jo mama 🤣🤣🤣🤣😎
How do they get these structures
AYDEN
o
AYDEN
I hate tiktok that are like this its like bro you dont have to be that amazing its just simple
So extremely skilled and cool and awesome and ratata
The third one is ez
Lol no one saw the water in reach 🤣
Just gonna say this seed looks awsome
What is that seed
How many Times did have you tried🤣🤣🤣
Bro there's literally water
I will stick with beginner, click once, doesnt waste a totem
How about you us the waterfall 3 feet away?
Codfish
So you agree your hacking?!😏
Or... u can fall in the totally non existent water like 2 blocks in front of you 😀
Just jump in the water...or not jump and use the waterfall for a elevator...
what seed is that
A hacker would have no fall..
I was ready to see dream style saves XD
Pov totems are for begginers abd Mlg fir expert and btw boat horse ride or strider ride is for the last one
Ah yes, apparently hacker always clutch with an totem of undying in an chest mid air. Makes perfect sense
Me:just climbs down the hill😂
Hacker seems easiest for some reason...
Stop lying dumb YouTuber we all know the second one you really just cut the video and then you get in the boat cuz I saw it slowed down time
*Dream ominously turns towards the video*
too easy
Where is dream >:(
Pessoa normal: cairia no rio
dont use that song please or im gonna tear my ears out
Too easyyy
The Smart one:  * jumps into the water *
If you can do it, are you hacker?._.
I feel like hacker lost all meaning
How abt Dream?
The boat is impossible in Minecraft bedrock
With this sound I hear sapnap in the background lol
Nah the hacker just.. lands
I can make that hacker easyer than pro
I’m all
I'm a beginner 🥲
Tbh water is harder than boat
Except for saying him hacker you can call him as god....😅
Okay, now we have proof he's a hacker
I would have landed in the water
Noobs(like me): Just ducking die.
More like noob vs pro vs dream
Hacker aka Dream
Wrong, a hacker doesn't take fall damage.
Just jump in the water
First : get this crap song out of this video  Second ; why would you do that if you can just water mlg like normal and it work
Me and the boys can do all clutch on mobile:😎😎😎😎😎😎
No hacker is dream creative is the hacker
Quick question where is the dream?
Beginners just jump off a little or jump into a premade puddle that's what I do atleast
Clutches I can do easily:  Water bucket Slime Powdered snow  Boat Ender Pearl Hay bale
I'm gonna make a anti-used music army to bringe you idiots down
And a funny how the last one is the easiest one
Actual hacker be like What is fall damage
Me: jumping in the water
Water buckets like that are hard because you land between blocks and place in the wrong block.
Does that mean I'm an expert?!
Mlg your channel delete button
Yea im Hacker
You telling me it's hard to click two times while falling? *spits out chocolate milk* Pathetic
Bruh why does hacker need a floating chest can't he just use his hacks to survive?
So far is the difference of hacker into super skilled
Your edit sucks
Me: Where's the part we're they add a smart person that's jumps into the ocean?
Try to rail and minecart mlg
Ninguém fala a merda do nome do anime só tem gemté que fala ingles que merda
Expert : **Exists** Me : Ahahaha! That is easy! Later.. **Togry has died because of fall damage**
Noobs wouldn't be able to clutch
What is below the noob bc that is me
I would fail the beginner so much
Bruh I did the chest one with 5 planks then crafted a boat like dream and clutched
For the third is a T.A.S ?
GUYS AM I THE ONLY ONE THAT I SAW THAT GIANT MOUNTAIN IN FRONT OF THE PLAYER? THIS IS THE BIGGEST MOUNTAIN AT THE HOLE MINCRAFT HISTORY. BACK AT 2011 SOMEONE POSTED A POSTER OF A MOUNTAIN THAT WAS THE HALF OF IT AND THE GENERACION THEN WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR A MOUNTAIN LIKE THAT. AND A YOUTUBER TRIED HOURS OF SEARCHING AND HE FOUND A ONE THAT WAS Y-221! THIS IS LIKE... Y-1000000000!!!!!!!! AND ITS IMPOSSIBLE FOR IT TO GANERATE LIKE THAT. WELL... THIS IS WORLD RECORD OR! A MOD...!!!!!!!!!
Yfgfgr
Legends: fall in the ocean
Oh i guess im a hacker
wait so does that mean your a hacker?
hacker didn't even mlg
I'm even worse than a noob 😢
Beginner was harder than hacker
Im not a hacker snd i can do the hacker one
Hackers is so easy
But all you need to do is a normal water bucket mlg🤨
Man sadly bedrock players can't do the boat clutch
No one gonna talk about the cliffs in the first one-
So I am A hacker After All aww man🤔🤔
They made it so there cursor is on the totem when they open the chest
Why my short the sound like thisssss
Hacker just falls of Clif and takes no damage
Nice
e
They are meant to be the other way
How is the last one hacke totem of unfiying is not vluth
The last one is not a hacker!
There is no right way of clutching use whatever you want just stay alive
Hacker would just use hacks to not take fall damage in survival
His mouse was on the totem because of the aiming of the crosshair so yeha
Mlg Mid-Air Craft Boat Clutch: Patheitc. (Deam Did That Impossible Trick In His 1v5 Manhunt Video)
Yes, the player better at MineCraft wod use a way more complex option to save their life.
U can just get blocks and block towards the water slowly but surely right?
zzzzzzzz
His mind: how fake should this be?Hmmmmmmm Him: YES
as a beginner... the beginner in this video is extremely unrealistic 😭 i sometimes struggle with 2 block jumps
Omg finally I see someone crediting Cod
The last one should have been a chest with 5 wooden planks, then after that, a crafting table, and you have to jump, get the planks, craft a boat, then land a clutch
That last one not hacking it called real gameing
F. Yeah
Wut none of them are hard
mobile game adds be like:
Ratio
That's a waste of totem though.
Oo
Fucking codfish beatboxing the background ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Yes a very big prasmotr in the video. I wish my videos had a similar viewing collection. I liked it 1
The ‘expert’ literally just spun around in the air and took a boat out of his inventory.
Allah is an idiol sending many people to hell don’t let you’re country or you’re up bringing send you to hell or determine what’s right or wrong jesus is the way the truth and the life which is why Christians face the most prosecution Muslims don’t no one really cares no Muslim would be killed for being a muslim but christians are the most prosecuted group in the world that should tell you something either Jesus is who he says he is and claims to be and you’re wrong   That should tell you something if Satan’s not coming against Islam that should tell you that it’s false you need to come out of that and get to know the true Jesus who can save you and give you peace and joy and assurance of eternal life and get to know the true God  You’ve sinned nor amount of Good deeds can take your sins away there has to be justice a payment you can’t rape a million woman’ and say well God I fed the homeless I get to go to heaven there’s no justice in that and God is just perfect in judgement in God judged that way then even hitler would be in heaven or Satan   Now someone has to pay either you or God and Jesus paid the price for you’re sins all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus   So receive the gift
Him: *water* *boat* *idk the name*  me: /gamemode1
Bruh jump in the water dum dum
Bro I have been doing the MLG water clutch for, 4 in a half years on the Xbox 360 edition
Next level: Dream
Fun fact:expert is actually easier than beginer     I just found it funny
God level should be dreams clutch boat save
Don't bring me down is the worst song ever
the hacker one is friking easy
what is different
How many tries did the hacker one take? 🥵
Jokes on you water mlg is better than all
My Brain: i cant handle this music, time to gain stress
.... DO A BOAT NOT A DAMN TOTEM
but can you do dreams boat clutch 🤔
The boat one is begginners too tbh, expert id say block+ladder
Me: tries to land in the ocean and dies
Nah you gotta be dream Cluch  level
No? Hacker will turn on anti fall
Even the begginer one can be hard if you place the water and it glitches
boat is way easier than bucket
The last one should be called dream instead
I feel like I'm the only one who's never heard this song before
Throat singing isn't reverb or dub step. Either learn to really harness the tone and volume from real Mongolian performers or just add some echo in post. Im expecting some good jams, not krusty the clown and sideshow yomamma
Me, an intellectual: wasting your totem is not worth it ;-; i mean if you are a hacker, maybe u can hack to not take fall dmg lol
THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN-  noob, normal , expert, DREAM-       (this is my opinion its fine if it doesn't matter to u :)
Wich means me lmg water bucket doesn't make me better and slime clutching?
Its not hacking if no ones watching
Aren't hackers supposed to...ya know "hack" ???
Wow! You have fast reflexes! You must be a *hacker*
You missed the final stage DREAM
Dream level- crafts boat while in air
God:jumps on the ocean
The boat is easier than water bc you can spam boat and if you spam water there is a chance you pick up the water at the wrong time
So your telling me that getting a totem of undying from a chest while falling and using the totem will consider you an hacker? Pathetic.
My guy failed the boat one lol
My dude made it go from hacker expert and then to beginner lol
guess im not even a beginner-
U nerd
Thats not even begginer smh
I like how the hacker is easyier than the two cuz ive tried it amd its easyier hahhhaahhaha
Only a dumbass uses a totem to clutch and a smart man use water
I swear people always be like Noob vs pro vs hacker Wha- WHAT THE F**k  do you mean by that?!  Its based on the player A newbie A average A Pro  A Veteran The first to play the game There are those type of player Hacker is uhh (I hack in minecraft) uhhh-
How does that make him a hacker anyone can do that if they put a lot of time in to it
If I hear this song one more goddamn time, I'm committing a war crime
1mil iq craft flinting steel burn boat get on land on ocean done
Dream who fall and see crafting table craft a boat 🗿
"normal person" keeps going forward into the water
hackers dont need to mlg they just hack si they dont take damage
Dont forget ladder clutch
And then there’s the fortnite toxic kid who builds his way down
Water: so I’m a fucking joke to you 😐
That's it dream is the hacker that's that
Your a hacker:0 ?
I'm None- ( I Throw The Bucket )
Doing any of these in a non dangerous situation isn't cool.
dON't BriNg mE DowN
there should be a boat in the chest just to make it harder
When you play on bedrock: 😬
This is the stupidest thing you could post
It all worked, so why would there be a difference between beginner and pro
Ugh the music destroy my ears
You look like a kid that was bored and made this.
That aint hacking, just a good gaming chair
Body Type:  Not terrible but definitely enjoy dying 💁🏿‍♀️✨
The water bucket is actually the hardest one, you can fall on the ground and then the water will appear, you can also place the water but miss.
mans should have landed on water.
I made an hacker clutch in bedrock
Gratatah great skillz btw
The hacar was the worst
0:12 that's not being an expert I mean you litteary used a slow falling chest right there and for hacker how's that hacking?
On the second one they want full dream mode
WTH IS a hacker when he IS not hacking
I wonder how many times it took to do this
I didnt hear this song in a while, thanks for ruining my ears again
Where’s the ‘Dream’ Version?
Tiktok just abused this song same as yt shorts
The hacker one is soooo dream
Beginner would die
I hate ppl who ruins songs. Make them moEr COoLl. And then ppl use it with some effects and explosion of cringe
God: save and leave, then rejoin
Try the boat on bedrock edition 😂
A hacker will just do /gamemode2@craitive
Fucking stan belike: wHeRe'S dReAm!!?!?!
Hackers Use command blocks
Khaby lame help
Welcome to another episode of:WHY DO I ALWAYS HEAR THIS SONG
Plot twist : spinning around dosent make you good or look cool
The beginner is beeter the the hacker and pro i my opinion
Hacker: nofall activated
Hackers don’t even take fall damage
But dream does the beginner 2
Average dream manhunt
That song sucks tbh
To be honest, taking out an totem and then using it is a lot easier than boat clutching..
If I got a dollar every time I heard this song I would be richer than the queen
You know if there's water already, jump in the ocean
First of all it hurts my brain when you say hacker because if youre a hacker you should've just clicked creative mode right? Like bruh the one with the totem of undying is just elite or veteran lets say not a hacker
Hacker one was the easiest- smh
*me wonerding if there is a dream stage and then seeing the end*
Can we replace the word clutch with GRASP in full caps cause it would be funnier to hear someone yell GRASPED IT.
Or you know you could just jump in the ocean instead of trying to flex
This beatbox performance is from codfish
U like slowed down at the boat clutch idk if it's the effect but u did slow down and also dreams water clutch is bigginer? But cool still cool love it I don't hate it
This are easy bruh
hacker can just turn on *no fall damage* hack SIMPLE
Hacker isn't rlly hacker cause it's a totem :/
Dreams boat clutch was a lot better than hackers clutch
Not even close to what i can do
Cringe
Codfish beatbox
All the clutches looks the same bro
If you're a hacker then use creative mode or some kind of hack
I SWEAR IF I HEAR THIS SONG AGAIN I WILL LITERALLY EXPLODE
I play osu the chest one is easy
The next time that I hear this song I am going to boil the original poster
This is backwards actually
I HATE DREAM BECAUSE OF HIM CLUTCHING IS COMMON NOW WTF and its not called CLUTCHING its called MLG
Why is dream not in this
belive it or not hacker is easiest
Hacker should be replaced with dream
I like how they barely get more difficult
The song sounds like the dude is burping lol
I swear if I hear this song one more time, I’m going to riot    I’m going to riot now
You forgot the level after hacker THE DREAM METHOD
Kinda cringe bro
Christ, that goddamn song
I hate this song so fricking much
No hacker wouldve just went into creative
I have to stick with water bucket clutching bc on bedrock you die if you try the boat clutch
Why is it like sapnap is talking in the background
Shouldn’t the hacker survive the fall without taking the totem
Hacker is dream
Guys he just hace a godly gaming chair
Y'all are calling Dream an average player... Bruhhhh
I really love watching your Vids Grata❤❤❤
I swear everytime i hear the dont bring me down song it then shows people jumping off cliffs...      When will my man get his wish...
No no no no, Hacker would be Dream’s Boat Clutch. Yeah, I said it, come at me, Stans
Bruh
Me using the giant river/ ocean that u can clearly see
Someone who actually has a brain: goes down the hill block by block
Excellent beatboxing skills 👀 hmm... yes very ✨fancy✨
I would just try and go for the river. Pretty sure it's close enough to make it
How am I an lower class than an beginner :,)
I can't even do the noob so what am i
I’ve seen an mlg where he grabbed a shucker box out of a chest, took a crafting table out of it, crafted a boat, and then place the boat. All in like a half second or something
Nah the hacker is more like a veteran
Chest one can be harder or easier,  depending on flick skill. No timing on the totem really,  but timing the flick can be hard.
Bruh all are possible
All of them are easy
In reality a hacker's clutch is so fast you can't even see it with the naked eye.
Beginners the safest one
Can we talk about how the last one is easy ;-;
what’s this? 👀 -> https://youtu.be/r49BShq-x28
The only one that’s maybe hard for some people is the one where you need to get the chest  The water bucket is harder than the boat clutch
Well, not really hacking if all he does is use a totem of undying, but you do you
The beginner is my hacker
Damn dream and the hacker are really close oh yeah he is one •_•
Why is it called hacker when its not hacking it should be named god
Whats the point when your just going to live
Can we talk about how they slowed down when the boat was placed
I think 3 is easier than 2 but i havent done it so im not one to talk
Ah, yes. Hacker.
I am worse than beginner and I've been playing Minecraft for like 7 years.
bruh... just sprint jump into the ocean. ez
I just use slime blocks
i do not care
Anyone else see the slowdown on the mlg boat clutch
I think these kinds of vids are overused but good skills
Most hackers are bad but can do thing that are unbelievable so what you should do is a very hard thing then fail at the end
I will never comment on this
And then there is Dream who crafted a boat midair
damn i guess im a  beginner minecraft MLG clutcher
