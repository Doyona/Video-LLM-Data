A City fan saying VARsenal is hilarious
The jokes on Harvert are on you lads. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
"There's no way that was offside" ... err ... it was clearly offside.
As an Arsenal fan I come back to this video every now and again just to see the joy in Adam soul leave him
Hahahaha he hates Arteta & Arsenal 😂😂 cos his beloved Man Utd are shocking. Ten Hag is class like 😂😂😂😂
Always good to see fraud Mckola cry. The most bitter rival fan out there. 😂😂😅
Varchester United
TENT FAGGG worst manager EVER!!!  Full of Excuses 🤬
at the start you would have thought arsenal have dropped 6 points talking about them already being out for the title
I can't tell why Buvey is so anti-Arsenal if he's so sure City will walk the league. Garancho was offside, Havertz's penalties have been given before, and Gabriel used his strength against Hojlund. Jonny Evans was fouling Gabriel as much as it was the other way. Arsenal clutched up when they needed to. But watch us lose to Everton after the international break. Never forgave them for beating us 2-1 last season after Godfrey stamped on Tomiyasu's face and didn't event get a card.
They really just hate Arsenal all of them. The tears 😂
I love how silly fans think losing a match at the beginning of the seaspn is fine but at the end is bottling it. All games count towards the result.
Adam "Chicken Curry" McKola got exactly what he deserved... with extra f*cking spice! #AFC
It is not a penalty but neither is it a dive
Own goal ; Welcome back t Utd Evans; the gift that keeps on giving...
Lol why do we still wine about onside vs offside. We do by now know the angle we see is just one chosen camera. In order to determine offside they don't use our camera view. They use multiple angles and computer software to determine exact positions. We absolutely cannot trust out own eyes from 1 view which is 10 yards behind the play to determine what's onside 😂
Adam’s voice gets so quiet after arsenals 2nd goal 😂 rollercoasters of emotions
A Man U fan that is also a Bulls fan?!?!?! Noooo way. Never heard of that
HOW BIASED WAS RORY ON THE OFFSIDE GOAL? THANK GOD CHELSEA ARE IN THE MUD HE DESERVES HIS SHIT CLUB STRUGGLING 😂😂😂😂
what is the brudda on the right on tf?? Everytime plays are checked on the VAR bro says "VAR is killing football" like tf u mean "killing football"?? Does bro hate a fair and right decision?? mfs always have to be hating on smth man
These guys are idiots like, as fun as they are to watch
He was literally offside its not a judgement call
lol this chelsea fan is a huge hater. we didn’t play terrible. we had united the whole game but couldn’t score. idiot
Adam is always the sensible one these days, absolute redemption arc from him
it’s because of fans like Adam, that nobody likes man utd fans
1 min of joy 😂
Adam Mcflury in effect
Is Rory slow or something? How he can't comprehend the offside is genuinely staggering.
All ex refs: “It’s a clear off-side” Rory: It’s never offside pathetic, Garnacho was onside
Rory it’s offside, the lines were drawn, behave Rory 😅
Rory is such a walking hyperbole.
this 2 guys the way they laugh are going to kill this poor United Fan lol 🤣 he looks devastated and depresset lol
Arteta is a fraud lol look closer to home
Cry more
VAR made good decisions here that would have been hard for a regular referee/person to spot in the moment. It wasn't a penalty (even though literally everybody thought it was initially), and they overruled it. It was offside (even though everybody thought it was onside), and so the goal was overruled. I dont see how making the right decision can be a disgrace or ruin football.
These lot literally got every ref decision wrong 😂
How they managed to get three of the most unlikable "youtube" personalities in the same room is remarkable  Add thogden and you got a HOF class of 🤡
"Arsenal have been terrible and have stil won3-1"  This is why this channel is a joke, and so is Rory.  He's literally watching the game live and comes to that conclusion.  Were Arsenal at their flowing best all game? No.  But they deserved to win, and played some beautiful football at times. Brain dead analysis in this video.
Cannot relive the disappointment of this damn game. Great show guys.
David Luiz was sent off a couple seasons ago for the pen on Havertz in the game.
Rory has eyes but can't see
You know what the difference was there? Jonny evens coming on…. Famous last words 😂
Why does buvey look like a South Park character
Adam is one of the worst United fans out there. That’s just a fact
Rory Hates Arsenal LOL, when Rice scored he couldn't hide his disappointment , and then reality and then neutral again
what a goal by Jesus btw
Adam during a united game is somehow the most unbiased
I absolutely love the childish laughs and excitement that you all go through while watching these games. It's endearing! I am the same way..Football brings so much joy to so many people!
RESPECT MCKOLA 🙌🏼
" is it too reactionary to say" Yes Rory it is but dont worry you'll contradict yourself tomorrow.
Adam & Rory 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
Arsenal played badly???? 😂😂😂
Iq of Gabriel that's why he should start bullshit this start as a 4 and go to a 3 4 3
Arsenal won 3-1 and they've been terrible! What?😮 Man Utd  ball possession had been by Onana almost alone!😅😅
He scored 1 for Arsenal and he’s top but when he was playing at West Ham no one was rating him as one of the best. He ram games including united Arsenal at back end of last season
Are these guys taking the piss? When Mckola is the less biased guy in there, that tells you something.
The three of them wanted arsenal defeated....I love it
The anti arsenal league got humbled 😂😂😂
Also has Rory ever had an opinion on a player or a decision etc be correct?  fucking clueless.
The rice goal perfect get and be on in there ❤😂🎉😢😮😅
Skibidi toilets doing my headache
Can’t believe people really think Arsenal played terrible. Credit Adam seeing the offsides
Chap in the middle is a clown ye the type of chap that grassed in school
top tier entertainment. and i'm not talking about the match 🎙 🏆
Buvey sideeyeing mckola after jesus goal at 12:26
Gabriel is classsssssssss!!!!!
Buvey and Rory arguing the Offside and calling it a “disgrace” is hilarious, so delusional it’s actually mental
Utd fans should see the face of Adam when Odegaard equalised.
How can you hate arteta😂
Adam. Your manger is still playing ole ball.
I love it so much that rival fans hate our coach! Lol cry forever!!  Arteta is the MAN!!
how can you have the lines drawn and call the offside disgrace ?😂
why do you guys keep saying "ga-ar-nacho"? it's gar-nacho"
i'll never get why people like these think it's ok to bully and mock professional players who are having a hard time. Just spreading so much hate.
Adam Always looks like he is going to cry
I cant wait to hear the explanation behind "arsenal played terrible". Maybe bandwagon a little less against them.
Arsenal were terrible? These 3 need to start watching another sport they actually have knowledge about.
Honestly feel like people lick united ass cause to tell me arsenal didn’t play when all united did was hit on the counter makes me laugh.
Rory proves he knows nothing about football more and more each vid
Bruno and Rashford are huge problem for Manchester United
Someone teach Rory what offside is!
I know Adam is vexed but he’s the first and only Man U fan I’ve seen say Gabriel did well with the defending the goal. The fact that he did it during the game while it got chalked off is respectable as fuck 👏🏻 That’s just being objective without bias. Fact he has Man U bias and still spoke like that gave me mad respect for him tbf ahaha
Newsflash : Martinelli was offside by a ‘rizzler paper’ last season against United and was denied a goal that would have put Arsenal 2-0 up and given them 3 points, and Man United went on to win that game 3-1. 🥱
Adam is a clown as per usual lmao
U could see Buvey so disinterested the quality of arsenal and Man U can’t keep up with city we going back to the City Liverpool race boys only 2 teams that have showed real quality so far this season🙌🏻
They clearly proved it was offside and you guys are chatting shit like they lined something up incorrectly and didn’t view it 5+ times lmao
I love how these guys want wrong decisions to stand. It's so odd. Like that goal should stand even though he is offsides just because you like the feeling of it??  That might be the dumbest thing I've ever heard. Imagine saying you want refs to get decisions wrong for your own watching pleasure. That would absolutely ruin the sport
Adam 😢😢😢😢😢 is just 👌👌👌. He represents exactly what Man Utd are. Arrogant c*nts!
Havardz aside thats as strong as it can be Jesus ahead of Eddie no .The fella in the centre dosent have a clue about football i dont think he knows how offside works .
What game were Buvey and Rory watching? We pinned them back for the whole of the first half and they couldn't get out their box. They had 1 shot and it was their goal. Havertz fluffed his lines, Saka missed a clear cut chance, Rice had a clean header and the pen was stonewall. We should've won by 5 mimimum lmao. The Arsenal bias is actually ridiculous.
If Arteta is the one who just handed ETH’s ass to him on a plate AGAIN, then who really is the fraud then Adam?😂
The most unlikeable Utd fan, nay, the most unlikeable bloke full stop, in the world fully mugged off. Glorious 😂😂😂
"That's a disgrace" It's quite literally offside mate, don't know what else to tell you
I can't tell how much seeing Adam cry fills me with happiness  😁😁😁
Beautiful content - I hate arsenal fans but seeing Adam's face makes it worth it
How is it a disgrace if it’s not giving as a goal when it’s offside 😂 even the Manchester United fan knows it is
Never been offside ridiculous decision
How embarrassing is Rory claiming that offside goal based on nothing but hopes and dreams
Arsenal only won bc of VAR and United’s backline injuries. Simple luck. They didn’t do anything special to win the match.
Galatasaray are also in talks to sign Davinson Sanchez on a permanent deal
Tanguy Ndombele is set to join Galatasaray on loan with an option to make the deal permanent
Gabriel won that game with that 1000 iq play for the offside
as an arsenal fan this is one of the funniest videos on the internet
Rory could be the biggest smooth brain imposter ive ever seen
Haverts is so bad its hilarious
Short lived 😂
The meltiest of melts
Was murdyk on the field
It’s not a ridiculous decision he was offside how is it a disgrace Rory Chelsea are awful mate
Buvey acting like Evans played last season, was injured for like 70%.
Buvey a city fan calling The Emirates a library?! Wow
How the fuck do they all go from “it’s a penalty”, sit there for 2 minutes and go “no way that’s a penalty”….? 🤦🏼‍♂️
Gabriel did a 💯 iq level for making garnacho offside by straightening his body
Anyone else surprised to find out they are in chairs not a booth 😂
Teta owns you.
Rory is so deluded😂😂😂
How are they saying it should’ve been a goal when it was clearly offside😭🤣
BATTERED
🤡🤡🤡
McKola is hilarious. I've watched this guy chat shit about Arsenal for 2+ years now, saying things like "This Arsenal hype is mad" and that Arteta is a Fraud, and yet, they keep finishing above his club
I said it before the season started and got so much abuse. Without the takeover, Utd are going to struggle big time.
I can't stand Asenal BUT Mckola's tears are the most delicious of all. the absolute Pr1ck
Utd score Hold Hold Hold Ahahahahahaha
Plastic dirty dictatorship supporting city boy needs to pipe down. It's easy to win if you cheat bubba 🤡
Mar-teeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee-nez, learn how to pronounce your own player mate 🤡
McKola, Howson and Rants are the holy trinity of low IQ bitter United fans with zero ball knowledge.
Hahahaha your tears taste sweet😂😂
"Arsenal didn't play particularly well" - yet we should have scored 6... the score flattered United
Look at that scamp of a Chelsea supporter with the gall to describe Arsenal as “terrible”.
Shut up Rory man, it's offside.
When do finally play a big team???? 4 Games against small teams who park the bus. Coyg
No chance Arsenal wins the league
Nothing better than seeing these 2’s teams in the mud!! I don’t know who the guy on the right is tbf
The ONLY reason why Rice scored was because Evans was manhandled by an Arsenal player and stopped from defending getting to Rice quickly enough for me.
The bloke in the middle is insufferable.
The fuck you guys saying Arsenal did not play well.    United were playing bottom half team style football. All you did was time wasting and pass the ball to your keeper.   United had no strategy or intention to attack. Just hoping your keeper to long pass to Rashford.
Rory tryna argue with offside like it hasn’t existed for years now 💀
Rory is a pillock
Here for the tears
That Rory talks absolute rubbish. Pc man trying to earn as much money as possible
How can the only united fan there be the most reasonable 😅 idk how you can debate the offside...visually it looks offside and they've drawn a line too...be better guys 😂😂
Rory’s football knowledge can be pasted on the back of a stamp!
Arteta what a fucking fraud😭😭, I love these tears from Adam!!
These guys are  backstabbers
Mckola "we arnt in crisis" you picked up 3 points out of 24 against top 9 teams away from home last season
Please guys - try to be less biased - you lean too much into creating a narrative sometimes - I know you can do better - Arsenal played better this game, while Manchester United played like an expensive Stoke team - Maguire and Martinez got subbed off cause they where defending the whole game in their own half (almost in their own box most of the time)  You should demand better from a Manchester United squad a this point - I know they got injuries, but can they do anything else than play on the counter? I really don't know anymore - really disappointing to see this big club play this way
adam with the usual bee in his bonnet
Three stooges … adam mckola if you say arteta is a fraud how about that baldy ? “Eras do come to an end” 😂😂  spend so much money only to spam long ball over the top for rashford 🗑️💩
Yo lads"the club" as we say "the firm"?
I hate the “this player just got relegated” argument. Yeah Evans got relegated, so did James Maddison. Just because someone gets relegated it doesn’t mean they’re automatically a bad player.
Buvey have somehow emerged as easily the most sensible of these three....
The tears!!!😅😅😅😅😅😅
I love that Adam hates Arteta, because its the same energy Arsenal and most rival fans had for Sir Alex pre retirement. It means we're a good team now and they just hate to see us win
Heres the thing arsenal played to the end regardless of perfect play they came back from being down so to say they didnt play well is a ludicrous statment.
If hes a mile or a cm offside hes offside buvey , they dont deserve a goal that was against the rules. They already got 3 from wolves they didnt deserve.
ginger doesnt see offside
give credit my ass. when you suck you suck.
rory laughing when chelsea are dogshit. 😭😭😭😭😭
Don't understand the fella in the middle, sounds like hes never kicked a ball before
came here for an Adam disasterclass and was honestly very surprised, he was level headed and reacted pretty sesnsibly to everything, rory seemed more annoyed by the offside than Adam did
Rory was waffling all game, an offside is appareently not offside cos in his eyes it doesnt look like it. Then chatting waffle about ramsdale  all game just for onana to make an actual mistake
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahha get iiiiiinnnnn
Rory talk too much. He ask a question and then cut in before the others can answer.
UP THE ARSENAL ! ! !
Take the L, United you are 💩
Compare this to their reactions last week for Nunez last minute winner
How have arsenal been poor? They 10X better than United.
VAR is ruining football is quiet ironic coming from a Chelsea fan
Rory saying that Arsenal had been 'terrible'😂😂😂😂 omg bro, did you watch the game?
Tbh this man u squad looked good all game and I'm an arsenal fan. If they can maintain this type of performance and guts.... easy top 4. Ten Haag is legit but yall need to drop anthony asap.
The irony of the Man U supporter saying that the pen CANNOT be overturned, then 9 Hag saying that every decision went against them😅
Advice to Adam change ur team as soon as possible if not u will be depressed remaining of your life.
I have lots of friends who are United fans so even as a Gooner and being delighted with the result I don't enjoy seeing them suffer, but got to be honest Adam is so unlikeable I absolutely love watching him squirm and cope as his delusions fall to bits in real time. Have that you  weapon ha ha COYG
imagine having a football reaction show and having rory on it for his insights and opinions, cant take it seriously really
Funny how you thought it was a pen when Rashford dived literally 7 days ago. 🥱
I used hate fargie so I understand why he hates artata hhhhh
“Hate that c*nt”😂😂😂people hate you way more you bellend haha!! Adam is a proper melt.
Enjoy a level headed Adam. AFC fan, but been following you for years on years mate. Rory goes from Football IQ 120-30 in these clips
Buvey - Johnny Evans, the worlds biggest flop, he got releagated last year with Leicester. James Maddison - Hold my beer!
Mckola is a tramp, these new fans might not know about your past but I do! Do you in next time you're standing outside old Trafford with your mic
This game hurt but Jesus Christ, Hojlund looks fantastic (obviously not even a full game, but I need to take some positivity from it).   I cannot believe we bought Johnny Evans on.
Martinelli Vs Wan Bissaka; 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is art. Glad to shut you up
Rory is a melt
the scenario at 7:27 David Luiz vs wolves 19/20
Havertz penalty contact was minimal, accidental.. 3 years ago we had luiz sent off for the exact same reason against wolves and a penalty for them…. I’m happy with the non call this time round… it’s fair..
Buvey saying Varsenal when he supports city is top banter 😂😂😂😂
Adam should talk on his own team
United score 2-1, Rory: its never offside. 5 mins later: 3-1 Arsenal, Rory: united in crisis!
Rory Jennings: don't worry. Its not even close to being offside!
Rory is so dumb... celebrating all the goals😂mate chose n team n stick
Your 180’s on the Havertz pen incident 😬  Least Rashford against Forest was a ‘Legit’ pen though.   Same goes for Eze against Arsenal too btw. Shoulda been a pen.   I guess the word consistency springs to mind. Guarantee that challenge at the Etihad would have resulted in a pen.
Adam at 4:02 "We did this last time then we lost"
Adam the only one with eyes, buvey & Rory clearly need glasses the amount of call they got wrong. Ffs offside isn't an opinion, its a fact & they disagree.
man united tears are the best tears 😂😂😂
9:18 yup. Evans was the difference. Very astute observation 😂😂😂
Hold that Adam 😂😂😂
It was offside all day long Rory behave…..
Keep crying Rory 😂😂😂😂
What are you guys giggling about? too much of that and you will sound like a bunch of high idiots!
Man Utd was horrible at their home game last year and won 3-1. Now we do the same
I can't see where this United team are going other than nowhere
Oooph that last 3 seconds. What a bitter bitter man
Hundreds of goals get ruled out for centimeters but apparently this one is ridiculous n a disgrace lol
It hard for MU to win away because MU dont go down the narrow path [ CHEATING  ] to win . I watch MU to watch a good soccer match , NOT to watch cheaters win tbs .
Respect to Adam for being so level headed
Rory think its onside, without even an angle to see.. hahahaha
Bet buvey grew up adoring Shaun goater 🙄
Why do two of them have headphones on and the middle dude doesn’t ?
Arsenal were the better team and deserved to win.  Man U and the their manager saying it's not off side.  Are they blind.  Did they see when the lines were drawn.  Come on!!!  Yes it was close.  But off side is off side.
Rough start to Premier league life for Onana.
400 mils spent and have maguire and evans as cbs.Erik Seven hag's masterpiece.
Maguire and Evans is championship defence. What a joke
genuinely rory has never said anything that made anyone think 'wow you know he may be right".
this 3 lame guy are arsenal haters, and sorry to disappointed you guys we won ;) #COYG
Adam should’ve been worried as soon as Rory said “it wasn’t offside mate”
Adam: "Arteta, f***ing Fraud". Really is he a fraud or Eric 7+3Hag?
If it is 1 inch or 6 foot... Its over... Its called offside! Buvey, Rory!
Ahhh, breathe it in lads
"You know what made the difference?... Johny Evans coming on. Hahahah"...  A FEW MINUTES LATER...  😅🤣
Sorry guys but what does he say at 5:25 exactly? "Has he given it"?
To arsenal they think they won the league today. United better team at arsenals own ground just like last season but yet they think they deserve to win the league cos they beat a poor united side. You ain’t winning shit again this season lets face it. U needed maguire to deflect you winning goal to only talk about how good rice was when he went missing the full game until magire came on. Still living in the shadow
When you HATE someone it's because they're world class at what they do. Arteta already is & he's reawoken the GIANT in ARSENAL. Never forget Arteta is The Chosen One. COYG.🙏.
"Arsenal didn't play well". Give up.  There's a difference between not taking your chances in the box and generally playing badly.  We weren't bad at all, we just didn't take our chances.  When you don't do that and it's the last 10, instead of being 1-2 up and controlling the game, making subs, slowing it down... we're still 1-1 and pressing really high up, trying to win.
The saltiness in the last 20 seconds of the video... just... MMMMMM the tears are so good. Arteta a fraud? He's not the one fielding Harry Maguire and Geriatric Jonny Evans
Rory on this stream in comparison to his vid is insanely diff😂🤦‍♂️
Oh.. The disbelief on the face of Adam... 😂😂😂.. It truly made my day. 😂😂😂
It was a definite penalty he was through on goal😆 clowns. We still SILENCED & HUMBLED EVERYONE ANYWAY. COYG.🙏.
Dumb mf, how can you say it's onside when they drew the lines to show it was off. Salty urinated fans and even ETH deluded slap head whinging saying it was onside. Loved Adams tears.
Offsides aren’t up for debate guys - you’re either off or on, and Garnacho was definitely off😂 COYG
Buvey the most slappable face on YouTube
COYG I’m loving this podcast this year you guys are so salty towards arsenal it’s hilarious
Rory... take a bow son.... officially the biggest doughnut on YouTube 😂
Up the fucking chels man
How is Rory arguing with a clear offside, lol.
Rory: Arsenal were terrible and they win... what game was bro watching?? Arsenal deserved the win and if Saka and Havertz buried those sitters scoreline would be the same
How is it a dive, touches his foot mid mid-air whole he is sprinting...
Ngl what is Rory on? Man City are miles ahead of Arsenal, this doesn’t change that 😂👍🏼
105m G. Barry baby!!!
Adam ate those words after the johnny evans bits
What a bitter bastard 🤣🤣
Lol shut up Rory, lose to Forest at home after spending half of japans GDP, lmaoo and that autistic Man City fan too. COYGGGGGGGGGG
Im not sure what game you guys were watching? Arsenal weren’t terrible! Man U just hit them on the counter, it was arsenal with most of the ball!
Three clowns
Onana is shit. he is so bad, I bet if they shoot from the halfway line he wouldn't grab it. you can tell he's not a shotstopper. how the hell He hot his team to the final last year I will never understand! Wan Bissaka might not have touched Havertz, but Casemiro sure did, that Pen should have stood. But man utd got away with it again, but Karma is out in full force and they lost anyway
🔔🔚😂🤣
Goals Reactions  3:29 rashford  4:19 odegaard 8:50 garnacho disallowed 10:52 Declan Rice 12:23 Gabriel Jesus
Premier league title race always been between man city & liverpool😤
Jesus sent Dallot to hell for playing for Devil’s club 😂
Fair play to rory but I hate him
Hahaha some salty salty United fans , we won deal with it man , a win is a win, we played bad and still cooked you guys ,....wait now watch they will complain everything now , var , pens everything , just hold that
Love how confident Rory was that it was offside
Adam looked homeless for a while there
Stop sayin hes onside hes clearly off 😂😂
After this weekend buvey has no right to talk in any essence about VAR at all
Rory calling the offside a disgrace is a disgrace in itself. Just man up and accept you are wrong, like you are most of the time
Oh man so good to see @AdamMcKola so devastated. This guy deserve all this. Still think Utd finishing 2nd now huh, Dickhead?
"Arsenal looked soft against palace" wtf are u on about you entitled 🔔  end
traitors all of you
Love Adam McKola  . . . . . . . Crying
Buvey’s and Rory’s takes are painful listens
Rorys takes never ceases to amaze me, how one man can be so wrong about so many things is mind numbing, be better bruv
ARTETA LIVING IN ADAM'S HEAD RENT FREE 😂😂😂
Bros it's offside man ahahhahahaha
Adam ahhahahahhaha
Who gave 3 idiots a mic and a studio 😂 own up right now
Never offside, disgraceful
Life came at Onana and Mckola fast today
Mckola the big 🔔
2:35 best moment.
To think this joker thought united would win the league.
Lol change tune much it was a pen the player came across and that causes the trip because havertz is running and is impeded
It’s a deffo OG
Let's all laugh at Adam 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂  I must say tho...The Club has by far the BEST set of all these footballer youtube channels. Pure class!
“Do you know what the difference was there, Johnny Evans coming on” famous last words😂💀
I would also hate Arteta if I was a utd fan 😊
Dalot got sent back to Portugal 😂😂😂
Shut up Buvey “out of the title race” after 4 games man😂
This is so satisfying should be a ASMR
I prefer Rory than those two tbh, Rory makes stupid statement Atleast he’s respectful to other teams where as Adam and buvy pheewww you guys deserve every bit banter 😂
As an Arsenal fan, I found Adam’s views and reactions so refreshing. Yes he was giving it large and indulging in some banter, but his feedback and instant reactions to all major talking points was remarkably balanced and objective for such an emotional game.
These boys, especially the one in the middle,  behave like jilted cheerleaders. :)
If i had a company that sold toilets I would buy Adam McKola's pain face caused by Arsenal to sell my toilets to customers.
Rory and Buvey’s facial expressions 13:07
Adam MCopela
the adam tears at the end were fucking delicious cos he's been obsessively hating arteta for years HAHAHAHA
Rory "it's never a pen when they go to VAR to check"   Does this man actually watch football?
When is reality going to hit for the bell end on the left that United just aren’t very good 😂. I can’t even begin to imagine how depressed and bitter he felt after this game 😀
This Adam fella is a bigger fraud than Ten hag 😂😂
I didnt watch the game but i heard Arsenal dominated man u, but united were clinical on their limited counters. Yet these guys say Arsenal didn’t play well, which is it?
Adam's example of Havertz foul was exactly what was given against Arsenal in Wolves game 2 years ago
Rory arguing an offside 🤷🏾‍♂️
Bloke running onto the pitch for a 3 year ban is in fact Mohammed Elnneny 🤣
Arkansas revisited
Still waiting for the Chelsea clip...
"Arsenal didn't play well" lmao. Did they even watch the game? Ten Hag's tactics were just fire a long ball to Rashford and Inshallah
Please I need Adam tears to wash my dirty linen
" Mate its not offside " 😂😂
How do you watch that match and say Arsenal was terrible?! That’s a well deserved win.
Mckola got those serial killer eyes 👀
warra title charge for the red devils. get kieran mckenna in
Haha Maguire and Evans 😂😂😂
BAHAHAAHAHAAHAH HOLD DAT ADAM 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
HAHAHAHAAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA  ADAM MAKOLA YOU BUM 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Bunch of clueless clowns, literally no substance.
Jesus this is possibly the most disgustingly grim lineup I've ever seen in any type of media in my life. Holy shit
This is funny as fuck. 3 clowns 😂😂😂
9:22 Johnny evans really was the difference😂😂for arsenal🤣
Rory Jennings hates Havertz as if , havertz is his ex wife
He should be more angry that his club play like a bottom half PL team with a deep block and launch the odd counter attack to score their goals.
Nothing better than seeing Adam humbled. Let us know when you find your head again!
Yes Adam.. that gunnar toss pot is a fraud 😂.  Will ein FA mate... GGMU..
McKola is a meme 😂
Buvey talking shit as per
Guy in the middle is absolutely clueless.
Hilarious
Mikel should be starting Trossard or Viera ahead of Havertz.  This Havertz experiment should already be deemed a failure.  That's two games in a row where his mistakes have gifted the opposition  a goal.  Time for him to sit on the bench.
12:24 what were those noises 😂
Footballing version of the three stooges
New game, take a shot every time Rory is wrong. Bet you'd be drunk by half-time.
Adam is such a baby. Calling Arteta a fraud when Ten Hag has spent hundreds of millions and still has no play style. Only chance came from an Arsenal mistake, passed around their own half all game and then got a deserved LOSS for their performance. Inject his tears into me, no ball knowledge from that freak.
Buvey called the Johnny evans own goal 😂😂😂
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
😂😂
The football Gods had their way with McKola today! 😂😂 #brilliant
Rory is shameless, Chelsea lose 1-0 at home vs Notts forest..We Know Chelsea aint winning the league 😂😂
The fact Adam hates Arteta so much and as an Arsenal fan I don’t mind Ten Haag says it all 😂😂😢😢
Whose that b***h on the right with a face only a mother can love
Rory what have you smoked before you sit here
HOLD THAT ADAM
HOLD THAT, i know you were all sick to your stomachs when Arsenal scored and celebrated the rice goal. Thats what £105m singing looks like Rory, Enzo and Caicedo could learn from Rice 🤡🙏
These man have zero ball knowledge it’s actually crazy
Rory undercover united fans
Buvey is not the one to be around when you are under pressure. The Carrington lines was funny as hell!
I’ve always though Havertz was shite, but Chelsea fans always praised him, until he left 😂
It's like a league of anti arsenal fans
Have some of that McKola you absolute dud 😂😂😂😂😂
This is the content I live for
Rory, yet again proving hes a complete clown and a fraud. Clueless
Love this maniac’s tears. I am thirsty.
Was miles off. These lot are comedy gold with how stupid they are! 😂
Honestly I feel like I wanna subscribe but not enough because the bias is crazy lol Rory your a football man, like ya chat. I’ll stick to the algorithms lol
YNWA BABY
SIT DOWN ADAM
Them saying arsenal poor and can’t beat us 3-1 😂 well getting beaten by a poor team makes you poorer than Arsenal sorry but Arsenal beat you 3-1
Buvey does talk a lot of shit, arsenal were not soft, hopefully we stuff City in October
Rory is a harden listen. It’s offside that’s how it’s not given 😂😂😂
Mckola you sour turnip 😂 that last line about Arteta. Hahahaha stick it into my veins. COYG
And I hate u to Adam
That garnacho call was so hard to take today, still don't think it was offside
I don’t know how it was not an offside. Gabriel played him offside. It was tight but a clear offside.
United are well and truly in the mud! Right where they belong!
Adam’s ego was hurt I love it
Arteta the fraud. What’s ten hag then. Doesn’t win away from home.
adam was legit teared up at the end amazing
adam so in touch with utd, resonating on some real freaky fan frequency shit the way he was calling things out that were yet to happen 😭😭
Why were rory and buvey complaining so much about garnacho being offside😭😭😭 how is it 'killing football' by following the rules😭😭
The Club, your match reactions is on Point. Just Knw Arsenal are winning this seasons
Mckola Tears are the best thing in football
They all are angry that arsenal won 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 jesus goal is some thing personal 😮😮🎉🎉🎉🎉
Arsenal are winning 🥇 🏆 this seasons
Onana is absolute dog ****
He’s not offside  I didn’t need the lines and knew he was offside
Mfs saying arsenal played bad 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 2.6 to 0.9 xg. Hold that you clown 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Rory is so small. Buvey is as tall as him while sitting down.
Mqncity fan supporting man u 😅😅😅
Bunch of arrogant pricks who never football at any serious level but ya, there to make fun...
All these idiots supporting United, this show is waaaayyyy too biased
Your tears are so sweeeeett
Man United are back
They wouldn’t even let McKola into clown school, he’s far beyond that level.
Nobody deserves this humbling more than United fans like Adam.  HOLD DAT
😂😂😂
The stupidity on show from Rory is shocking.
"Arsenal didn't play well". According to universal opinions, United were MUCH WORST compared to Arsenal the entire match 😂
3-1 ✌️
HOOLD THAT ADAM!
Mckola the clown 🤡
How can a correct offside call be a disgrace? Chelsea and Utd fans love sucking eachother off...😂11th and 12th..They are like brothers.
Arteta owns Mckbender😂😂😂
F**< EXCUSES!!............. SACK ETH!!............. GET DE ZERBI!!........... NOW!
the irony of a city fan talking about not liking people going down easy in the box. Classic lol
Arteta a fraud? You wanna be looking abit closer to home pal & don’t start all going on like you didn’t all gas that Dutch oven
Saka has been shocking since late last season... Can't handle pressure, average at best. Always poor against top teams.
This is a disgrace to watch as a united fan. Heart broken and 💔 shattered. We are playing Stone Age people Evans and Maguire in the 21st Century. Sad to see as a united fan 😢 We are a mid- table team accept this people.
Rory wishing for arsenals downfall makes the win even better
Eat ya words ADAM MCKOLLA😂😂😂
“We did this last time and we lost” ahahahahaah
I love it when McKola cries
Lovely to see that moron Adam Mckola crying. Adam Mckola is a typical knuckle dragging Man utd fan who deserved everything he gets. Long Live the Glazers.
Rory and Buvey to dumb to understand what's offside and what isn't. Nothing new here both have 0 football knowledge and are always spouting shit. Cry me a river 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Adam mckolla what was that you chatting abiut us arsenal😂 3-1 chump
Manc Rat never learns ......
you love to see it
The actual cheek of Makola calling Arteta a fraud! 🤫🤣 Guys got as much ball knowledge as a Curling champion.
You all deserve it.. your show is ALWAYS anti Arsenal. You are no longer balanced. Glad you sucked on this result!
buvey a city fan crying about offside is hilarious because yeah arsenal are the one with 115 ffp charges hanging around their head init ?🤣🤣🤣🤣
Hahahha MCKOLA
VAR 😂love it when it's on your side hate it when it's against you
'is it to reactionary to say' after 4 games is such a wild statement regardless of result
🍿COYG 😉
Man utd looks shitty
Havertz must have nobbed Rory's Mrs the guys obsessed with him 😂
Calls Arteta a fraud when Ten Hag played the leagues worst CB paring to close out the game 😂. And of course Ten Hag runs to the press to complain about referee decisions 😂
I feel the pain 13:10
arsenal not at all 100% but united were more terrible.. all their plan is to play counter attack and hope that will work.. small club mentality..
11:32 rory give it a rest. Arsenal were awful today and garnachos goal shouldve counted. city are gonna beat arsenal twice this season atleast again.
Arteta is in your head 😂😂😂
Goes 3-1 “he might be offside” 😂😂😂
What is hilarious is how Arsenal gets so much extra time when they are behind or level in a game. Man City scored 5 goals which included a penalty and had multiple subs come on and off and they were only awarded 6 minutes.
Adam McKola is such a typical united fan 😂😂😂😂from nowhere near Manchester and cries when someone talks bad about united with 0 ball knowledge
Just gonna soak up some of these delicious adam tears , so sweet
Both teams boring af, passing sideways, wasting time and just not playing exciting football. I'm mad at United, but Arsenal not much better, they are both Pep wannabees, that's what it is and I hate ETH for that.
United fans cant see the obvious problem.  ETH. Stood there like a statue. Useless
Is it just me or is that football that’s clearly deflated on the shelf bothering anybody else 😅
Fair play to Adam for being level headed for a change. Hope to see more of that going forward
Buzz lightyear man
Let's make conclusions after 4 games 👍🏽
Rorys a clown😂
All united fans deserves this lost  All the talk
Rory: "That's a penalty." Rory: "No way that's a penalty."  Rory: "He was never offside. There's no debate." Rory: "...."
Rory saying its a disgrace to not give the goal when a player is offside. He should just shut up abd gold that l from forest.
McKola celebrated too early 😂
LOL Buvey saying they're stealing football after yesterday's disaster of VAR in favor of City😂😂😂
Got to give credit to Adam for recognizing the Gabriel offside trap
Love how happy mckola is then got shit on 35 secs later
ETH is clueless
Btec Haaland still in gabriels pocket
When United win, there is no mention of VAR but they lose and it's VAR on all titles
“We did that last time and we lost”
Cry fc
“We did that last time and we conceded quickly”
12:25 Buvey glancing over looking for Adams tears 😂😂
Hold dat L and sleep mfers
Buvey hit the nail on the head about Carrington not producing young players to come into the first team squad.
Counter attacking FC... Heard United won the transfer window...title challengers ? My bum 🤣🤣
Pause at 12:09, do you see what I see? Can it be true?
Great win. Very good goal from Rashford too.
Can we just appreciate Adam thought united would win the league 😂
That opening comment from Rory is just big brain stuff. The amount of crap he says on a daily basis should be unhealthy for anyone
Big problems at united, factory reset needed! Players…manager & owners! It’s not the losing that’s the hardest it’s the lack of heart, ambition, workrate, style of play! If we at least matched arsenal for workrate instead of trying Moments FC or counter then I would accept but Nothing!
Adam is about to cry. hahahaha
Nobody is beating City this year. The good news is there is currently a 95% chance Real Madrid will activate Haaland’s £150 million release clause next summer. If they do the league will be wide open again next year.
Ten hag a joke Man United give the young chants
These grown ass men are laughing like babies when one of their rival teams conceide lol i can understand Buvey, but what is Rory laughing for?
"thats a disgrace it wasn't given as a goal " it was fkn offside what do you mean, if hes offside by a mile or a millimeter it's still offside, there is no if buts or maybes he either is or is not offside and he was, i wish ppl would stop thinking their Mk1 eyeballs are better than 24 dif fkn cameras with multiple angles im tired of the fkn sheer hubris of it all.
Our club needs another Munich.
Adam turns into a disturbed little child when Utd lose. Love to see it.
These lot are embarrassing the way they’re coddling Mckolw is crazy just acknowledge it hat arsenal are which is better then untied
How old is Rory’s husband?
*broken voice* he might be outside.... 😂😂😂
So happy to see Adam like that 😂👏😏
It’s mad how you always complain about VAR but your goal yesterday vs Fulham was 100% a bad decision from them for your benefit!
He was clearly offside
I don't get how they can watch that game and conclude Arsenal didn't play well.
If correctly calling offside is "killing football" I would rather see football die.
The salt on this channel against Arsenal is laughable
Unbelievable how we didn't get the penalty var joke again overturning the decisions on the field
MAGUIRE! 😂😂😂 is Man Utd sure they don't want him to leave?
If you are trying to win an offside why is that a disgrace Rory and your Chelsea is a disgrace to football with the money
Here for Adam...hugs guys...Onana, what's my name
You guys should do the best moments throigh out the game of winding up mckola too not just the big Ingame moments
Bruno and Casmiero so poor today constantly gave the ball away constantly not calling for the ball the manager has favourites but I don't get how he never gives Donny Van Der Beek a chance I thought Dalot and Erickson played well but you can't give away so many corners to a top team and not expect them to eventually score
Adam is the perfect representation of biased fan with zero ability to remove their love for their club when talking football.   This man was talking about United winning the league “or at the very least challenging City” and that Arsenal would be found out and didn’t have them as making top 4.   Rory and Buvey get a lot of stick for bad shouts (and rightly so) but Adam gets away with so many awful takes because next to those two idiots he sounds intelligent.
The smugness of Buvey is brilliant to watch. He knows how dogshit United are and the sarcasm even when Hojlund gets the ball “shoot! Do something!” 🤣🤣. 64m donkey
Arsenal played them off the pitch and still barely won. Troubling signs from Arsenal early this season
Garnacho offside is revenge for martinelli disallowed goal at OT
Adam’s tears quenches my thirst
Adam McKola 😭
I came for Adam’s ego bruising… I wasn’t disappointed
Nothing I love more than Adam crying 😂😂😂
You woulda thought Raya would be happy about Arsenal winning
After united scored and mckola was running around like a jack ass, they should have a narrator saying “30 seconds later” when Arsenal scored.
Park the bus  Park the bus Man Utd  The most diabolical football you will ever see home and away they just put 11 behind the ball walloping it into Rashford.   Onana the most overrated donkey GK ive ever seen. Awful shot stopper and he thinks hes the man the attitude on him hahaha oh my goodness its beyond cringe. 🤣🤣.   Cry adam you horrible little discriminating RAT🐀
Common Adam mckola L 😂
Both really poor, Arsenal won't make top four on that performance
Both these teams nowhere near city or liverpools quality this season, people slept on Liverpool but they’ve got the second best manager in the world and they’ll be back this season no doubt
I love watching Adam’s genuine tears but Rory’s love hate relationship is funny to watch.
HOOOOOOLD DAT POSSSYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 TEN HAGEN DAZ AWAY RECORD 😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
As much as I like seeing yanited lose, I actually think they played well. And hoilund looked very good.
Ten Hag will get sacked 🔜
United in the mud 😂
It wasn't a decision it was the fact. No subjective interpretation on the offsides. It's simply objective fact
So are United still winning the league?
MCKOLA IN THE MUD
My problem with people who complain with the VAR rule is how would we imploy "Offside leniency". Is 1 mm good, but 2 mm too much. Is 1 mm good, but 1.1 mm too much. And if we did find a "collective leniency", why couldn't we just stick with the Original "in-line" with the defender type of offside.
All is not red, I'm loving big Ange instead.
Havertz holding us back
Hold that adam, you prick! ahahahaha!!
United robbed by var!!!!!
Havertz has to go
Funny how VAR is “killing” football and labeled a “disgrace” when it actually gets decisions correct as well. Are you lot mad? The penalty shout from havertz was taken away BECAUSE of VAR and an undeserved goal was taken away due to offside BECAUSE of VAR. People just hate it when it’s against them, even if it’s the correct decision. Cry more😂😂
Ahahhahaha mckola what a bellend
tears from the most unlikable person to ever been born
Clear offside Rory cope
United fans were getting ready to cook Arsenal fans when Garnacho scored😂😂😂. The way the game turned out was hilarious🤣
united fans talking about VAR after last week have 0 shame.
Don't go with the narrative VAR cost Utd. It was clearly offside. Man Utd lost to a team unbalanced by Havertz who was playing average. Even so we were still deserved winners. That says more about how bang average and lacking in real quality Man Utd are. Who played well for Man Utd apart from Rashford? Bruno, was he even on the pitch?
United just aren’t that big of a club got  no heart and skill
VARSENAL
HOLDDD
Adam had United winning the league and arsenal finishing 4th. Let’s not forget now😂😂😂
VAR at the cellular level for that second goal was ridiculous
Much love from South Africa 🇿🇦❤
Wouldn't change anything that happened today.. luv those kind of Wins.,, especially Against Yahnited it becomes even more sweeter 😤💯... What a game as always at the Emirates with those last minute winners ✨💫.. I truly luv this club ♥️♥️🤞😩😩⚡🥲🔥🔥✨.. Come on you Gunners ♥️😊💯✨💫😤💯🤧
ADAM MCKOLA TEARS FOR BREAKFAST 😂😂😂😂
Sit down uniteddddd!!!!!! Actually thought they were better than us😂

Erupt
