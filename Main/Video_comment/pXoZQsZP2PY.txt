0:45 So classic units win
Men and their toys 😅
The passion of this man is really infectious. Great video.
so you CAN measure a balloon
I'm going to send this to my buddy who just started hitting the gym
My OCD was going off until he said a constant
Thank you sir you give me so much hope
I know length is determined by a drop of water.   Why did they not use water for weight??
10:04 thats what she said
this video has taught me that weed is way lighter than i thought
8:40 I really can’t get over how he just raw dogs his phone like that

Jon jones fuming hearing about pico grams
Milligrams......    Sounds like a factor of three too pathetic.   My chemist/pharamasist dispenses stuff in MICROGrams everyday.
"Yes, it's stupid" THANKS!
I loved the scientist’s excitement as he saw the 10ug sample on the camera.
1:00 "Yes. It's stupid." Thank you for your honesty sir!😂
Gravity changes depending on where you are on the planet.   Measuring at this level seems about as useful as putting a time on a pasta box; e.g. If i’m above sea level i need to cook pasta longer. It’s not based on gravity, but conceptually similar.
Oh
For anyone wondering for the thumbnails its 0.7 picograms if i am not wrong

how do you pick up, a atom?
9:24 i thought my screen cracked
Can Brillant be used by children? My son is 11 and my daughter 12.
never expected veritasium to speak the word "freedom" and "units" together
So... I haveth a laser pointere...
Did Doge retire this guy? I heard they were going after NIST, but I didn't hear if they actually did.
It seems that when it comes to  The science of measuring a very small amount of weight, I can unironically say that just being able to say we can do it IS enough to Make it all worth it. (Meaning that the capabilities we get related to other sciences is more than worth what seems to be kind of not worth it at the time)
I always tell people that a piconewton of force is needed to stretch out DNA
I'm so glad we have people like this answering the big questions for humanity
I always wondered what the force was. I always knew it couldn’t just be zero
But how did you know 1 kg was 1 kg?
I love that dude! He sounds so excited about his job! Wish him all the best
can we measure the ripple of the fabric of space caused by black holes merging with it?
This guy is amazing.
I love how the guy is visibly excited about his work :D
i love this dr😽😽✨
People who aren't understanding anything but still watching  👇
This looks so much like Zak brown...
May this excitement find me!
Therefore, assuming light has a minute mass, is it ‘possible’ to travel faster than light or is it the cosmic medium, through transference, which artificially affects the apparent weight of light?  Or does the principle design of laser light have some other influence?

Basically, we still don't know what we can use this for, but now we CAN use it, and new ideas will come.
Because of guys like him- guys that push the frontier of science, eager to share their knowledge- we can advance as civiliziation
it's like seeing an excited kid explain what he learned from YouTube/school to their parents, it's so wholesome seeing this guy explain things and I love it 😁
They bury this kind of knowledge for a reason. Erased Divinity book by Dorian Caine doesn’t just talk about truth—it bleeds with it. I couldn’t sleep the night I finished it. Not because I was scared… but because I finally understood why we’re kept distracted.
it makes me wonder  do we really know even two way speed of light ? i mean our whole assumption is reflection  of light in a mirror is a pure elastic collision and instantaneously  what about this tiniest forces there  ?  losing energy
here is one kilogram. It’s standardised across the world and accurate to use to make other accurate mass measurements.   America - let’s use some maths and make it imperial just to make it hell of a lot harder than it needs to be! Freedom!!!
That straight out of a toy store "hardhat" is probably to protect from the microgram class weights
8:49 "deez nuts"
I am surprised they are not wearing a mask because any siliva from talking will throw things out off balance seriously.
"Love what you do and you will never work a day in your life"  This guy has landed his dream job. I'm sure he makes bank, but he would do it for far less and with a smile. Dr Shaw is a gem, the world could use more like him.
What would this man’s job title be.
A dust particle on my tv was even bigger than the 10ug thing
Imagine having a teacher with the level of enthousiasme that this guy has. No matter what subject
I wish I loved what I did as much as he does
0:53 - Did he actually use the term "Freedom Units"? Note: the drivers manual for Ontario, Canada, up to a few years ago, still included the term "miles"...
But the center of gravity is always changing, shouldn't this be done on a geosynchronisis satellite?
Why does this video only lasts 15 minutes , i love to see people being passionate about what they are talking , excelent teacher.
FREEDOM UNITSSSS
Oh boy this man is so excited i love this!!
Dr. Shaw looks kinda like Gabe Newell
That was truly intriguing and I Don't even know why.
Even the oils from your hands can change the mass
Depending on constants for definition of mass will create circular reasoning on the measurements.  It's the same problem with the meter stick definition when using the speed of light.
Such a joy to see people like dr. Shaw. People with interesting jobs who are doing what they like to do.

5:38  The whiteboard when you blink in math class:
As a calibration tech I found this fascinating.
Loved the femto-Newton analogy with the gestures. This guy is ant man irl.
1:00 bro, that was the most correct thing I have heard today
The thing that makes this so fascinating is that since light is a Force, it makes sense why it would curve around gravitational fields. Light is just charged Photon Particles radiating from a source of Heat, which means as a "Particle" it has some kind of Mass. That Mass coupled with its extremely fast Speed produces a Force. Better yet, you can also infer that light, as a "Material" (since it does have some kind of Mass) has extremely high Tension, since the material is compressed around gravitational fields. Light was Nature's (and the whole Universe's) Solution to obeying Physics, despite how Physics-breaking light seems to be, because the Vacuum of Space cannot dissipate heat normally, so it has to dissipate Heat a different way, by emitting irradiated Photons to compensate. Energy cannot be created nor destroyed, so it has to change form in some way, and if you can't dissipate Heat with Convection or Conduction, then it has to be emitted as Radiation, but again, it seems we don't have anything to radiate since the Heat is coming off the Material and onto nothing, so what ends up happening is Nature "creates" a Material to carry that heat somewhere else, and so Charged Photons are created, and emitted into the cold vacuum of Space. Science is wild stuff 🙂
Like my little brother when he showed me his collection of marbles. Even if you were not into marbles at all you got infected by his excitation. So many people have to do miserable jobs that bore them to death or are nasty. What a difference it makes, when someone loves what he does!
This rasies a few questions in my mind. If a laser pointer exerts force from its light, then I'd like to know how much force does the light from the sun exert on earth? This rasied a few more questions, what is the suns gravitational pull in terms of measurable force? And is it (and other factors if any) enough to pull the earth closer by x amount per year or is the attractive force from the sun not strong enough to overcome factors like Earths tangential velocity, the suns mass loss and maybe the force the suns light exerts on Earth (although I beleive this would be negligible at best)? Also because of the suns gradual mass loss, would this make earth slowly get further away from the sun...atleast until the sun starts to expand and swallows Earth much like me and the ten cups of coffee I have per day, or do all these forces completely counterbalance eachother and Earth just stay put? I would very much like to see a video about these questions if they are worth a video
I love this man, wish there were more of him in this world
I want to be friend of this guy...
Amazing video. If you close your eyes, the professor sounds like Penn
In America we use American units because we’re ‘Murica MAGA country yeeehaw 🇺🇸 lol
Update: Trump decided we no longer need to spend money on science, and so to save a few dollars, he has ended funding for this facility   (Joking of course - but in all sincerity, this is the kind of federally funded science that our new president has been defunding)
This guy definitely plays wow and magic
I find it funny that atoms have a stronger pull to each other than a laser pointer has
I have a scale accurate to within 1mg and fun fact 1mg is about 2 to 3 grains of average table salt.
I’m sure you guys are familiar with fentanyl, it’s 100x more potent than morphine. 2mg is a lethal dose without a tolerance. Chemists are constantly pushing the boundaries and one insane chemical they’ve come up with is carfentanyl which is 100x more potent than fentanyl or 10,000x more potent than morphine. 10-20ug is lethal which is literally invisible to the human eye. It’s so powerful it’s classified as a chemical weapon and has been used as such. Its legal use is to tranq large animals such as blue whales and African elephants. So when you see videos of people telling you not to touch a piece of paper sitting on your car door handle, believe them, those scams are real. Any flake on your skin or microscopic dust inhaled will likely kill you and it binds so powerfully to your receptors that no amount of narcan is able to reverse the effects.
“Yes. It’s stupid.” - wiseman
I love this guy. He’s so pumped to tell everyone about his science and what it brings to the world.  Gotta love engineers
5:44 is there anyone who tried to set those now arbitrary values to 1 and see how we could mesure things up with those more universal units ?
This place: “gravity is roughly 9.801 m/s^2.  My physics class: gravity is 10

0:48 The U.S. is just a meme at this point. In every way possible. Enjoy the next 4 years. 🤣🤦🏼‍♂️
0:52 i dont think i would ever think that veritasium would say "freedom units"
As engineer I see the weight of this issue.
This is the type of man that needs to be a professor. Excellent at sharing complex knowledge!
İts a bit heavy
0:50 I loves how he says “freedom units”
Bruh I wanted to see the small force of a laser :(
What level of vacuum was the vacuum?
He built a machine that lets him balance electron repulsion against the local curvature of spacetime. That’s why he’s so happy.
There is truly passion for what that gentleman does in the laboratory.
When Derek lets his guest do all the explaining👍
-ish
Base 12 is the best way to do fractional measurements. Using 1/16 instead of .0625
why do we think that gravitational mass and electrostatic mass can be eqautated? as in one is from gravitaional field and other is from electrostatic field and mass need not to be same (as i think)
Hahaha 0:48

This guy rules
4:48 to 4:55 is that like a weigh of 0.0000001 fm2 radius of air
I'm confused I thought that the only way something could travel at the speed of light was if it had no mass. But if a laser beam has force then it has mass so does the laser travel at the speed of light or not.
Bro I wanna hang out with this NISTA guy while he smokes a doob and tells me crazy stories.  I don't smoke, but maybe he can help me weigh out my acrylfentanyl in micrograms or something wild like that.  That'd be fun.  These guys all seem like very intelligent, very easy going, just hearty, full of life people and I'm absolutely jealous of their jobs and the passion they have for it.  I'm just lucky I enjoy my high tech manufacturing job, working with vaporized cadmium and angstroms and torr and microns...
Please use correct Indian Map else don't show it :)
the tiniest force on the universe is women's attraction to me
Being unable to tell which reference weights were the ones that were drifting, they had to use a new constant. Now that they have a new constant, have they found out which reference weights were the ones drifting? Are they loosing or gaining weight? Did they figure out what causes their weight to change?
This man loves his jobb.. honestly it makenkinda loves his job too! He's so enthusiastic
This is a great video, but it did surprise me when the guy said,  "One millionth of a kilogram is a milligram". Slip of the tongue?
DNA isn't very stable, is what I've learned. Love the enthusiasm of this guy, he really likes to talk about his stuff, so cool :)
Love the passion in Dr. Shaw's explanations.
wow. just wow.
Oh wow i Love this guy. He is so exited and has such a good energy while explaining these thing.
Amazing measuring photons!
Gordon is so nice
If they can measure the force of light/laser , does that mean that photons actually do have mass ?
I just looooove when someone is so excited to talk about something they're good at :)
I love this man so much. Grabbing a drink together would be fascinating.
I am constantly converting volume and weight measures into metric so my recipes are easy to replicate. As a US cook and scientist I dream of simplicity.
that man is full of energy and knowledge. if he’s reading this, i hope he has a great day
Next time I wanna see how pure thought force is measured, I’m sure scientist find a way by staring veeeeeery long 😂
"Yes, it´s stupid" i feel that. I am an engineer form Europe and had to commission a plant in the US... it was hell. You do perfecly fine calculations and then you have to ruin the results by converting them into BS ....
Freedom units 😂😂😂
No matter where you go, all the experts you film are always excited about their job. That makes me happy 😊
Sure it's not sublimating the target?

First of all correct the Indian map
gotta love this guys energy, people like him is the reason we have nice things
It's confusing for me, why does it has any force, aren't photos weightless? This is why they can reach the speed of light
What a fantastic man, he is the beard of knowledge of the SI world. Good luck on your future endeavors. Gordon X CERN would be a nice collab.
He is so excited I LOVE IT
Dude, Gordon is pretty much in love with his work and when someone is makes it be loved by anyone and I indeed loved the subject
Thank god that our world has geniuses like this man in it.
Worked on a wearable infusion pump years ago, which was rated for rates down to 6 ul/h, which actually not as low as some insulin pumps go.  Even so, when measuring rates, we pumped to picogram resolution scales to get enough resolution/accuracy for our rate measurements.  At that scale, fingerprints on any part of the weighing setup would reek havoc on our measurements.  It wasn’t so much that the set up was contaminated, it was that there were volatiles out gassing from the finger prints and they were also nucleation sites for condensation so the mass measurements would never stabilize.
And you need a plastic helmet to scale these things, its dangerous 😂 When an individual who uses imperial system 😊 things are more complicated ...
I am a Com Sci major and I had a class called "Numerical Methods" where I saw how much "damage" minute errors do to actual calculations, and those errors stack so much. Precision especially with how computers does calculation is very important a close value may very well be far from the actual value. Even if the calculator spouts something, there will always be computational errors present and that should be minimized as much as possible, especially when dealing with very very small values.
Wait, what? A standard paperclip is a reference for 1g? That's ingenious! :D
@0:55 yes, yes it is stupid. Why can’t metric just be common measurement system.
Passion in the purest form, before question is asked answer comes out. Most people I know have 0 passion to anything, they live to eat, sh1t and die at the end leaving nothing. People like this passionate man are gems of this world. Thank you
Derek does not measure the force of a laser pointer in this video.
Very fascinating and interesting.
We aren't "secretly on the metric system." Everything we buy and sell is measured in pounds, feet, gallons, ounces, square inches, and tons. That that makes us secretly on the metric system *is* a stupid idea.  The mass of a piece of metal is what it is whether you call it a kilogram or 2.2 lbs. It doesn't become metric or imperial when the engraver puts the markings on the balance like some weird quantum effect.
Thanks gaben very cool
This man is so devoted! He is really into his work!
This man is just so good at what he does and so in love with his job.
Great content. Nicely done and that fellow really knew his stuff and explained super complex things so well, even an idiot like me understands it!
0:48 lies told to veritasium by the fr*nch government to keep us from being a free country
Not an ad, I had one of those lab balances shown in the video for years. It was not a semi-microbalance, but was rock-solid within it's limits of display. The LED display eventually died (sad face).  ETA: yeah, not the one in a massive vacuum chamber, the one in the lab.
A nickel is 5 grams....don't ask
Listing to this while I calibrate scales 😮
How do I get this guys job?
I wish this man was my boss. My current boss hates teaching me anything, it's like pulling teeth trying to enhance my knowledge in my craft 😔
Yeah, the most accurate measure of absolute gravity.  9,81ish   Hahahaha
we must keep this human safe.
tbh, that guy uses a lot of "you know"s
He looks like Zack Brown's long lost cousin😂
With growing horror, I realized our entire system of weights and measures is dependent on one hypercompetent guy in a basement in Gaithersburg.
Utterly ridiculous.
Just like when I’m a kid, I point a laser in mind just like pushing up lol
DAMN, humans are impressive😊
DAMN, humans are impressive
Hey @Veritasium, You just simply can't relate  E = hv = mc²  This is not possible since ,  E = hv measures the energy of a photon which has no rest mass  While E = mc² , Measure the rest mass of a object  Therefore you can't say, M = hv/c²
Freedom Units 🦅🦅🦅
The man loves his tweezers
The most accurate kilogram was made by the university of Queensland in the late 80s. It was a sphere, so only one dimension vs the complexity of manufacturing a cylinder. The sphere was so round, if it was scaled up to the size of the earth its biggest peak to trough variation would be a few metres. They tried to get it adopted as the new standard but the French said no.
What the hectonewton (even tho this is more than 1 it still counts)
This guy has Boris Johnsons mannerisms in the way he talks and shows enthusiasm
Awesome.
Being able to measure the force of a laser will come in handy when actual usable energy is transmitted by laser in DARPA's POWER program.
Homie just casually dropped that he's weighed LIGHT.  That rules
*"freedom units"* 🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅
He looks so cute wearing the safety hat
Very interesting :D The guy you were interviewing explained everything very good and I could understand it, he is very passionate too.
Finally, I can measure my pe-
if a photon has no mass how can there be a force?
Cool guy !
Correct me if I’m wrong but if light doesn’t have any mass how is it able to move an object? Nothing with mass is able to go the speed of light but some form of mass is needed to move an object
Bro put a suppressor attachment on his camera 😂
Yes, it's stupid.
so can they measure the gravitational force of a pickle?
Diesel particulates are measured by an opacity light
I watched 13 minutes of this video to figure out why people needed so sensitive scales. The tech is so cool but I was sitting here watching what is this exactly used for. And it does have uses.
now put it in a mouse
2:30…Waiting for Teller to show up…
Map of India is wrong
The man reminds me of my Professor in undergrad
I can assure you, the force of a laser pointer is MUCH more than that!! Several people have tested the force response of a laser pointer, and it usually results in a force equal to or greater than several squads of federal agents kicking down their door for shining them are planes 😂
Is it me or is this guy amazing and is very knowledgeable and enthusiastic about his work
Is it me or is this guy amazing and is very knowledgeable and enthusiastic about his work
Dr Shaw is the man
You cant measure connection force between me and my crush
i wish this guy actually spread knowledge, instead of just screwing it up for 40 minutes, i used to like this load of crap, now i see throguh every episode like he really believes his own bull
This channel hits different when you high as eagle boobies at 12,midnight
1:00 He said it xD
I could listen to Dr. Shaw all day. That man truly loves his job! Love the enthusiasm
6:06 a plastic ziptight will always be a solution even in the most precise fields of science and technology, probably more so than duct tape😂
Great video, but very far from measuring the smallest forces in the universe.  There are currently efforts to measure gravity waves that are orders of magnitude lower. Does not take away from how great this video is.
..love this... the smallest forces ever .. and the science of how we measure them.......
He was such an awesome teacher and truly passionate about his work! Great video Derek, thank you.
Wow. This really shows the scale of things.
this guy is so good at explaining
The art of people talking about something they're passionate about. I didn't care about this topic going into the video. After 13 interesting minutes, I do.
This man’s plug must tired of him
🤔A Kibble balance and a laser pointer can also be used to evaluate the activity of a four-pound cat😳
Love Gordon's optimism throughout this video.
Use silicon my friend… better results.
does camera has an additional property of deflecting a falling objects, basically acting like an orange helmet or that orange helmet was not required?
This is Jeff Bridges in disguise
Speck of dust, how about the cloud of graphite holly jeez
13:32 minutes and not one mention of the slug.  LOL .  This guy is definitely not one.  Glad to see we are based in the metric system
That NIST guy has a really badass voice.
Awesome vídeo! Thanks for this amazing class !
This video is proof that when you have someone who's both extremely knowledgeable and extremely passionate about their life's work, it tends to be fascinating to listen to them no matter what that work is.
Read a paper on how they measured the forces of a single sarcomere using these techniques absolutely crazy stuff
How can light give a force when it's no mass?
this man really loves his job, it was so satisfying to listen to him explaining everything
I love people like Gordon (and Derek) because this scale of metrology is needed to achieve atomic precision manufacturing.  Delightful transition from the macro world with balance masses down to 10 ug - to lasers for femtonewton measurements - which is measuring the equivalent of 10 picograms on a balance scale.
I feel like he's just making up words now 😭😭😭 femtonewtons wth man
Microgram doses...😉
Imperial weights are stupid (UK weights are even worse, why tf y’all measuring in 14lb increments?!) but I stand by Fahrenheit for weather and human temperature use. 0F is unbearably cold, 100F is unbearably hot, but neither will kill you instantly, and is survivable with proper equipment. 100F is also within the average healthy human temperature. 0C is pretty chilly, but 100C is instant death.   Fahrenheit for daily life, Celsius for science!
I spent a 19 month on secondment writing a blood bank pathology laboratory manual. While doing this spend many hours on the NiST website linking their reference data  to manuals for our accreditation requirements. The work and data they provide make them one of the most important organisations we have.
Dr Shaw is so engaging, so enthusiastic about what he does - I could listen to him talk about forces all day.
It’s just a matter of time before we can measure the ‘force’ in Midi-chlorians
I don't mean to be a jerk, because he seems nice, but this guy needs to learn the difference between "I" and "We". Pretty sure he didn't come up with this all on his own...
Freedom units
If you’re not this enthusiastic and passionate about your work and what you’re spending your time on, then you need a new career.
He knows a lot about small things 😏
The metrologist when his scale read 10.0006 😏
This must be Seth Rogans older brother who became a scientist
Dr Shaw is amazing! I’m so glad we have passionate scientists like him in the world.
He is soooo enthusiastic about this!! I'm gonna go out on a limb and say he loves this job.
The freedom units was hilarious
Cool, I finally found a guy who can measure the diameter of a gnat’s ass…
... any standard of measurement is accurate.   Imperial measurement, has other names, but it is a visualizing system where the rough idea of its size and shape can be pictured, where metric is better for lab, as you can't really visualize it imperically in your head.   then we have cubits,  but you can measure in anythign that your using as a interval for that space, via, a random twig broken at a some arbritrary distance etc. Not entirely sure the enemy here is metric or imperial... but unless you know how many cm, are in 6  feet stating 6 feet we have a novel idea of what it is. or even 1000 feet... or metres... the means of other groups attacking people and calling people stupid dsiregards that all forms of measure is precise.  The best thing of imperial is that its also can be wrong but be adaptive construct for smaller humans isolated ot their own measure of imperial if they base it since its living interval, sure its wrong to its standard but perfect for spread out humans... today, there is a definte standard, and yeah when you make a measure you need to send specific things to manufactures to that they are with a error of degree, however if there is 0.00001% error, it means the measure is limited to 10 thousandsths or less becasue after that it would be no longer accurate.  The funny thing is there is another way to make a standard. It involves a different udnerstanding, So what would always be exact and precise to a measure that someone could use, and send around the world. ALso the kilogram sent out should have a a geophysic data set, meaning it would require, pressure earth, humidity, rotation moon, etc, cleestial map and geophysical sources so about 900 factors for a measuring device has ot be recorded at its production so that mimicing those offsets or evne calculating those offsets you can make more exact replicas of that kilogram.   The point of exactness, would be picking something in the universe that will never change, and the best way is an active experiement, and then that use as a standard measure, with all teh same 900 factors included or more, or an islated control system  with an artifical vacuum, or removing gravity constant would be nice, but we don't always have space. but space would elimiante many factors when creating a measure. Anything on earth should be considered Earth atmosphere of creation since each piece of matter will be different then if it was  on a differnet planet, mostly liekly by the gravity, humidity, atmosphere pressure etc.  So yeah, there is a more accurate way to make a measuring system. decimals don't make something more accurate, natural ratios are typically exact, then makign a calcuation. nonetheless, pick something in nature that will never cahnge in this universe unless somethign changes, adn this also allows the creation of new instruements, like the width of hydrogen molecule as a standard in x and y... doesn't matter when or where in the universe it will be a system of possible measure, I can't remember but their is something that will always form the exact same way and can the nbe trasnlated as the interval for the unit, adn then you can double it or times it by 100. 1000, 10000, or 12.. s it doesn't matter... standard of measure is important to communicating and everythign is preceise, but as a stanrda manufactured elsewher its important to have some gauge... howeve,r what if you don't need to import nonsense and you can just create a vaccuum and sub zero temperatures and when x element or atom hits a specific gradient it has a common phase change and you can record that and make that your interval, of course thats a small scall but it can be magnified, but a larger system could be made, that phasing step could calibrate a specific volume of measure to fill a quatified means of space of that substance once you find its phase value exactness, using metric sure wit hteoutside machines, and hten you take alrger portion of it nowto the phasic state and replcate it int oits latice structure so yo uahve alarger refernce that owuld always be the exact same regardless in teh universe, even in a black hole if you can counter the factors you coudl calcuate teh same measure as one earth... be a bit weird as you wil lprbably be dead, but meh.
Finally now i know why standard calibration weight sets look like they do. I always wondered why they chose the weights they chose.
Did you know that the kilogram standard was based on a platinum-iridium cylinder stored in a vault on the outskirts of Paris?
Gordon is giving Penn from Penn and Teller energy
He kinda sounds like william afton in the fnaf movie and i love him for that
These videos make me so happy ^^
1:01 exactly it's stupid, and it serves no purpose
I believe if it exists it has mass, we are not smart enough to measure it.
This video is so pure, just someone talking about something they are passionate about.
$1 is 1 gram if you need say .1 gram you can match $1 to a thin thread so you can cut it up into smaller pieces cut in half and you got .5 grams or cut it in half again and you got .25 grams
Voice crach is crazy
Light has 0 weight right ? So jow is it pushing ?
From now on when Im gonna shine a flashlight at someone, Im gonna tell them: "I just applied a tine little force on you." lol
This guy should’ve been my science teacher.
I love it, .. great video, .. but why dont they count atoms instead.
Great video thank you.
Now can we just drop imperial and switch metric everywhere?! Utterly stupid keeping imperial scales.
America in a sentence: "You dont think it's Crazy?" "Yeah it's stupid"
I’ve never been so enveloped in a video before. Gordon’s charisma and excitement about his practice is very entertaining and inspiring.
It will be used for interstellar travel soon
Master specialists at work - always fun.  I bet a lot of people have the "why do we need this" reaction, but all that usually means is that THEY don't personally need it.  But, bottom line is that if it wasn't needed by anyone, it wouldn't be there.
My dad was a chemistry professor at a small university in Alabama.  I remember being amazed as a kid when he took me to a scale he had (this would have been around 1970) and showed me how to weight my name.  We weighed a slip of paper, and then I wrote my name on it, and we weighed it again.  I don't remember the numbers, but it was definitively heavier.  I thought it was pretty cool, but it doesn't take a lot to impress a seven or eight year old.  🙂
i love how hyped he is about measurments. its a joy to watch.
So, what do you do?  🎉
One of the best videos the algorithm has lead me to. Loved everything about this!
I love seeing interviews of people who are obviously super passionate about what they do. This guy was so excited sharing everything with you.
''How To Measure The Tiniest Forces In The Universe''? With a tinymeter ^^
2024 already and Amazon is still using pounds
at that scale you would have to worry about where the moon was in reference to the earth, and the earth to the sun...the density of the shifting core beneath you....there are so many variables when working at that scale...wouldnt the solenoid effect the metal test piece? have they thought of this and are using non-ferromagnetic weights?
Still some low iq people using pounds. I mean wtf is even that😂😂
I thought a defined mass is different if it's near to the earth's core than on sea level or above
In 1572, Tycho Brahe noticed a completely new star that was brighter than any star or planet. Astonished by the existence of a star that ought not to have been there, he devoted himself to the creation of ever more accurate instruments of measurement over the next fifteen years (1576–1591). His trusty assistant was Johannes Kepler who knew the accuracy of the data, and in fact invented the "error bar" when explaining his Laws of Planetary Motion. Kepler improved on Galileo Galilei's optical telescope, and Galileo complimented Kepler's improvements. Isaac Newton said, "If I have seen farther than others, it is because I have stood on the shoulders of giants." Newton was thinking of Brahe, Kepler, and Galileo. All of this is to point out that both Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation, and (earlier) Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion depended on improved measurements, just as Dr. Shaw says. Shaw is not justifying his work, he is stating a simple hard truth, that all of modern science and technology is standing on ever increasingly accurate measurements.
Let us be clear: defining the kilogram based on a Constant of Nature was an enormous triumph of science. It was the last of the Universal Weights and Measures to transition from an object to a Constant of Nature. Now we can tell the aliens around a distant star how much mass our bodies have, how tall our bodies are, and how long we live, and those aliens will get it absolutely correct.
So if you in space with a laser pointer you would be able to move, just very slowly
We just wanted to know the force of a laiser... not grams or KG
i saw the thumb nail and and the first thing that came to my dum bran. is can you get charged with battery for pointing a  laser pointer at a police officer XD
the tiniest force ive even heard of is the one imbeeteen my legs…
Looking for those 10 micrograms made me finally clean my screen
my punches in a dream:
This guy brings so much energy, I love hearing him talk!
09:22 I was wondering how small that weight is and then I realized how precise those printers are.
I really love how he is passionate about telling us how everything works, hes so excited and you can see it in his eyes and hear it from his voice. Truly dedicated to science <3
If only my dealer had this scale my life would be so nice.
Why the hard hat?
hear me out, if we get a lot of laser pointers and we aim them at one target and shoot at the same time, we can get balistic laser blaster
great video!
Wait, americans use the metric system???? I thought they were 32 of the cheapest IKEA glasses tall!
Everyone knows the tiniest force is Bidens focus on the US border.
I really like when someone has a job they are this passionate about. You can tell Dr. Shaw really enjoys his work and that shows when he explains things.
Its very weird to know that iridium is not radioactive.
My physics teacher told me how to do it. You take n  of something. And then, divide the weight by amount of something So, if something is too light to be measured on the scale Measure a lot of it, then divide the weight by the amount of stuff.
the Ben Brode of science
Scales and balances is measuring not science. You may have to measure while doing science but you’ll probably have to do other things too like math, research, make observations and think really hard but those things individually are not science. Most people don’t understand that. They think keeping track of some observations over time or measuring something very precisely that makes them a scientist, it makes what they’re doing science and their opinions on the topic also scientifically viable. Also models aren’t science either. That’s another one the large majority doesn’t quite get.
If the kg is no longer determined by the one in paris, cant we determine wether the original or the copies or both are changing mass? and what causes it?
Metric sucks, don’t start with me
I've never realized how much goes into making sure 1kg=1kg
finally i can measure my bench max
I’m a little confused because mass is not related to gravity! The balance at 7:20 measures force due to gravity. So I was expecting them to include a gravity meter as a reference to measure mass. But they didn’t. Gravity was only measured once! Gravity changes you can see tidal effects from the moon on a laboratory 5kg scale so it looks like there is significant information missing in the description of the electrostatic force measuring device? It’s a balance but not a mass balance!
this guy is like a comic nerd but with math
He'd be the perfect dealer. You really get what you pay for :D
6:48
This is so cool
But most of our products are designed in imerial system. I think imperial system still rules our world. Please make a video on this.
I'm confused because if we're talking about specs of dust affecting the most precise mass measuring tool in the world, and you're allowed to walk in there with plain clothes and breath out all your dead cells and humidity without a mask. Then we might as well be guessing? We're talking about piconewtons while there are more than two plainly clothed unmasked spectators speaking moderately. We're talking about detecting the force of a lazer pointer while talking over it in a moderate tone.
Actually you can measure way smaller quantities than that using piezoelectric properties of quartz. Even the weight of a single molecule
Sonething I was thinking today was how much force does it needs to separate  a covalent bond, and an Ionic bond, now this video shows up
FREEDOM UNITS RAAHHH WHAT IS A KILOGRAM
So what you're saying is, I can push someone under 5"3 over with a flashlight
This lab could have measured the force that the light from my computer screen exerted on my face as I watched this video. That kind of breaks my brain.
To me this is similar to making a clock more accurate. GPS is possible because they made a supper accurate clock. They didn't know that is what would come of it. We have no idea where getting more accurate measurements of force will go.
Dr Shaw seems like hes such a nice person
In india we take more than the mark on vegetable to buy
Dust? Any one need a hair net?
Dr. Shawn's excitement to talk about his job is soooo contagious! Love it
I like this video! Science nerds are cool.
Something about seeing someone so genuinely excited about science for the sake of science restores my hope in the future of humanity
Need this guy asmr
That tiny wire doesn't look that small. ICs and other electronic devices, like transistors, for instance, have thinner wires connecting the dies with the chip pins xD
I am now measuring a tiny force in the universe thank you
my head hurts
Veritasium: Where we complicate the simplest of things and simplify the most complex of them.
During my bachelor in physics I worked on a project which also measured extremely tiny forces, we are talking  tens of attonewtons (10^-17) here. It truely is crazy stuff.
every man when their favorite toy is being appreciated will react exactly like dr shaw in this video
dis how i be weighing dabs
Why is Derek holding a camera when someone else is filming both of them anyway?
this guy loves his job and it is absolutely contagious. we must protect him.
Dr Shaw must be a relative of Andy from LTT same wholesomeness
Re-watching this now, November 13, 2023, 7:16:24PM and I just realized how the guy explaining is so enthusiastic about how he weighed/made the material (10:57 timestamp)
always wondered if i got a bright enough flashlight, would i be able to close my door
I swear to god I've heard Dr. Shaw's voice before... who does he sound like? It's so familiar...
I love how Gordon explains everything with this amount of passion. He loves his job and you can tell
10:04 someone use this in a meme
I jacked off to this video.
that dude was cool af. you can really tell he enjoys his job
I never knew light applied ANY force, that's interesting.
But can it weight a baggie?
There's no need to do all that hectic calculations, you can just Google it 😊
1:40 😂 the panic in the men voice was real. He was like: what a babarian question.
doesnt that mean light has a mass ?
Shakes a balloon  “That’s a good question”
Freedom units 😂
It's so nice seeing someone do they job they were truly born to do.  Not because it's flashy, famous, or anything. Just because they freakin' love it.
I do not understand why automobiles need that accurate of tech, the first side was I drive over is probably enough force to break everything and make it useless. Maybe that’s why cars don’t last 10 years today
This is such a stupid question but how much does the moon have a effect on masses that small. My thought was if it can pull the oceans it has to have so effect on everything else, right?
I really wonder if he is related to Penn Jillette of Penn & Teller. He looks and sounds justice him.
What practical uses do these measurements like phemto nutons have? None! His entire lifes work is pointless. Absolutely pointless
The masses of the original kilograms didn't change. What changed was how precise our measurements got.
I love how an expert in measuring things uses “ish”
I live this guy dude 😀
w the metrical system
I have been teaching high school science and physics since 2009 and have used many of Veritasium's videos in my lessons. I just showed on physics class his video on Newton's 3rd law (12 years old) earlier today. I watched this video at night because it came up on my feed. I then went to the mirror to see how much I have also aged.
the amount of cope to convince yourself that we use your eurotrash system lmao
This man is awesome
12:19 tictac :D (Written by my son)
Can we just talk about the fact that the US are based on metric system but apply a conversion after ?! This is so American...
One of the things I love about channels like yours is watching people get super-excited about things and concepts that most of the population would watch to help them sleep LOL -  I really appreciate the enthusiasm and importance of such things. Femto-Newtons in a world that is addicted to Megatons, and Horsepower, and even just a few kgs.
Fascinating man!
this guy was passionate, he loves every aspect of his job, that's insane. Every detail he gave was well explained with great examples. Another great video 👌
My god.... His excitement is infectious. 😅
Love thought provoking stuff like this
Sir I think you are cool. I found this quite informative.
France and England have historically been competitors in colonial age. So it is not surprise for US and France to be friendly. What surprises most is US not adopting metric system among the first ones outside France.
Jokes on him, I have a scale in my bathroom
Absolutely amazing and fascinating. 😮
Gabe
12:18 "That's a good question!" he declared, with the aid of a bright orange balloon.
Ask my girlfriend 😢
Didnt NIST lie about 911?
We use a nickel 😂
Ffffffffffffffffff
10:05 Relatable 😢
Watching the guy get excited about his job was pure joy
This man really loves his job
I love this guy. What a wonderful presentation!
This guy seems genuinely so passionate about what he does. 👍👍👍
US is stupid lmao
This is so cool. I can't believe.I took so much time to get a degree. Can't wait to graduate and work in a field like this. Ugh. I would love it.
This guy? He would be an awesome professor - because he is not camera shy and has extreme enthusiasm and power.  We need more people like him.
Surprised its not a proper cleanroom?
👍
It’s so funny to me that there are so many conspiracy Q theories about this place. Some guy was just caught who was planning on bmoming it .
femto? GRIFFIIIIIITH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I guess the reason Americans still use their dedrateR measure units is cause they want to be special.  Like with everything.
Lol that 10 microgram test weight is quite big compared to the smallest timing washers used in watchmaking
I love when derek gets scolded. of course you cant pick it up with your fingers
I'd be excited too if I got to work with lasers and microscopes in an underground bunker
Loved this guys energy and how he was able to share that
ele é um querido quero ser um químico igual a ele
My year seven teacher loved to say "small things amuse small minds". He was a moron.
I love this man
idk what he said but it was so intresting😊
Us is secretly metric 😂
I just came here to comment i love his enthusiasm but apparently thousand other people before me already did so ❤️ i love the energy. ❤️
I'm shocked they don't require electronics-research level suits to work in these environments. Aren't the water particles from your breath greater than masses being measured?
Just by the thumbnail I felt stupid enough because I never thought about that lasers might have a force.
You and your dumb metric system. Please stop trying to convince us Americans that we use the metric system secretly. There’s nothing about us that is metric we are all American and we have our own US customary measurement system. Get it through your thick skull.
Ish?? Is he german
12:13 Derek: "Can I ask you a BIG question? " Good pun 😂
I think the smallest force in the world is a mouse cursor banging at the digital frame of the computer. 😅
I love this man's enthusiasm. He absolutely loves what he does.
If light is bent by gravitational forces, wouldn’t it effect the device?
i gave a like just because i hate imperial units
0.00000000000007 NI-
N1
I want to learn from Dr. Shaw.
His voice reminds me of Penn! (of Penn & Teller)
Are the mass measurements traceable to the USGS microgravimetry?
I was surprised that they didn't need hair nets and special static and dust suits to work in this lab.  I would think that a particle of dust or a dead skin cell could interfere with the measurements.  I remember back in the 1960s what a tedious job it was to calibrate a mechanical balance to do quantitative analysis measurements.  Electronic balances were just coming into the lab and were so much more convenient.  I was also struck by the measurement of the force of gravity on the floor of the room because in our physics lab any massive object(person) near or passing by a test of minute forces could interfere. That's why the force of gravity is only known to a few decimal places.  Too many things can interfere with the measurements.
I bet this guy could explain how paint drys to me and it would still be interesting
Metric is so stupid, you can tell because no one uses it for time.
The real people in the USA are metric, the plebes are not.
Does it help with job security to weigh a ton at a government funded weigh station? Maybe hes a constant for heavier measurements.
what an awesome scientist!
Hey I have a question, if a laser applies a force then according to the equation F=ma it has to have mass (if m=0 kg then F=0 N) but, if lasers travel at the speed of light and light only moves that fast because it doesn't have mass then how does it work? Now that I think about it, E=mc^2 but light has no mass therefore it shouldn't have energy but we know for a fact it has. Can someone explain me all of this?
Dear Derek,  I am Armando Almaraz, let me congratulate you on your very interesting channel and of which I am a subscriber, now to the comment:  From what is exposed in this video it is understood that a laser light beam makes a silicon parallelogram flex vibrate by means of a "photon precision force" and I put it in quotes because this is where some questions arise.  What type of laser is being used? FEL? Is the vibration of the silicone sensor caused by the "precision photon force" or by the excitation of the material and the air caused by the intrinsic momentum of the laser wave "energy"?  If we know that:  F = m x a  What is the physical principle that causes "photon precision force"? If it is shown that photons do not have mass, ergo does not have force.  And now to finish:  I am not saying that the measurement mechanisms are giving us false data, the only thing I am saying is that the physical principles for their operation may not be correctly explained, so it would be worth going deeper into their true operation, which is obviously not the "photon precision force".  Or maybe the method is wrong?  Thanks Derek keep up your fantastic work in popular science.
turn to Jesus Christ he loves all of us more than anything and he literally died for us. He took in the punishmrent for our sins thru  on the cross. It wasn’t cuz we deserved it, but cuz he loved us. 1 John 4:10 “This is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins” it was thru his love that he died for us and we can be forgiven
I love how there's suddenly a balloon involved somehow without no explanation 12:18.
I love this guy's enthusiasm.
10:05 brings back memories augh
Everyone seems surprised about his enthusiasm  In china markets where livestock are slaughtered, every butcher exclaims loudly everyday. "3kg of Dog meat and 500g of bats" !!!
everytime he says something with an L it turns into a W and it is hilarious
Sometimes I dont have any clue what this guy talks about but his content is nice.
6:06 zip tie :P
1:11 Average Harvard admissions for a 4.99999 GPA be like:
That was surprisingly very interesting ! Great video and great guest !
_"World's Roundest Object!"_ is still my favourite Veritasium video -- I can't begin to say how many times I've watched it -- so it's always nice to see a reference back to it.
You don’t often meet people, let alone scientists, who are this happy. As someone who works with doctoral scientists every day, Dr Shaw is a great example of picking a felid of study that makes you happy
Those uses were really really important. You can't always use kibble balance to set a standard for all of these industries. Test weights really come into play to the practicality and usefulness of metrology. Measurements are just literally numbers if there's no actual thing that represents it. We don't have to always excite Caesium atoms just to make sure the accuracy of 1 second. A well engineered standard will always support a truly working physics at hand.
The mass standard dude looks and sounds like a D&D Dungeon master.
The amount of time Dr. Shaw said -ish & about, shows how perfectionist he is.
I don't think i've ever seen a man this trustworthy in my entire life till now
Dr shaw is awesome, I love his ponytail and I love how he, an accurate measurement expert, says -ish at the end of all his numbers
I love how happy this guy is to share.
...ish...
he sounds like ed kempr in the netflix series
It's important to note that the equation E=hf is specifically for massless particles like photons. The equation E=mc^2, on the other hand, applies to particles with mass that are at rest. These two equations should not be combined or used interchangeably.  The equation you derived, hf/c^2 = m, suggests that a photon has mass, which is not correct. Photons are massless particles that always travel at the speed of light in a vacuum. Their energy is determined by their frequency, as described by the equation E=hf. Because they are massless, photons do not have a rest mass, and the equation E=mc^2 does not apply to them.  It's essential to apply the appropriate equations and concepts depending on the situation and the type of particle being discussed. For massless particles like photons, the energy equation E=hf should be used, while for particles with mass that are at rest, the equation E=mc^2 is appropriate.
Without a doubt, doctor shaw stole the leading role in this video. 😅
The meteoric system is insane. Converse between the commonly used units involves two or three orders of magnitude. And it’s not designed for a human scale. That’s why everyone in the uk gives their height and weight in feet and pounds or stones.
The Funniest thing I learned today is that "USA is secretly Metric"
I am surprised a lab need a gravity mark doesnt wear mask
I really thought I experienced déjà vu 😅
👍"like" a simple click of the default "like" button was not enough. I had to write it and emoji it
this guy speaks with such infectious enthusiasm that I found myself grinning to myself at the end of the video. love him.
Pony Tailed uncle cannot contain his excitement at the fact that someone in the mainstream media is excited in his work
DID HE JUST CALL FREEDOM UNITS STUPID?!
dude i would curl this weight 10 times easily
These are the real, enthusiastic and trustable SCIENTISTS! The opposite to those other fake “$cientists” that are $lave$ from Bill -Kill- Gate$’  deadly W H 0 !
How do they build an underground lab like that ???
there is no freedom units its all fake
su
Imagine you let fall the 10 micrograms standard.
I love how passionate and excited Dr. Shaw was, explaining this. Honestly made this 10x more enjoyable.
I love the I fix it tweezer
Now I want to switch careers!
I wish I could remember anything I see in these sort of videos :( very cool vid tho
They went to OfficeMax and picked up different sizes of staples and use them for weight calibrations! Ha…. kidding.
just another reminder of how skinny you are look at the effort they put in for you 😅
this guy is absolutely legendary. The true definition of scientist
I love when people wear hard hats in places where it is absolutely unnecessary
Loved Dr. Gordon Shaw. He is so passionate about this. I could hear him for HOURS!
This guy is super interesting.
If they can measure the force of the gravity, why can't they use modulated gravity wave to send information?
If the US ever stopped applying that conversion and went to Metric, all of their infrastructure would begin to collapse because the conversion would've added or subtracted some important decimal values.  Now they're locked into a false reality.
wasnt there a video a few years ago about the perfect sphere having a certain number of atoms so that the kilogram is no longer based on a physical object? WHat happened to that
MEASURE LOVE (aka the most powerful force in the universe)
Why yt says it's already 13 minutes when just 30 seconds have passed? I wish I could have a job like that :c
It is for sure, the man is passionate about his stuff
This is not fat shaming, but it’s so funny that a guy with a passion for such small weights is massive himself. 😂  His passion is contagious though. What a wholesome dude. 😊
I can listen Dr. Shaw explaining things for hours, he's such an awesome dude!
Finally a gym for me
imagine losing that 10 microgram mass
I still find it so surreal and cool that something weightless can project a force at all.
How did he film himself filming him at 6:26?
Dude could probably touch the "Quantum Realm".
Dr shaw is the kind of science teacher that would make the class/subject far more fun and interesting with just his passion and energy
P
Vegetable sellers just do it with their hands on the Indian road sides.
Good work
I suddenly have a very important question. If I laser pointer can stretch out a strand of DNA doesn’t in turn that mean a laser pointer can destroy or damage that DNA? Then the rabbit hole of repercussion comes to mind. 😮
Its quite a cool video here, on the laser, thats actually measuring electromagnetic force, light is already there and doesnt "hit" the target without electromagnetic energy to excite it into the visible spectrum, so what youre measuring there is Gravity.😎
Actually, the pound is not secretly metric, the pound is a measurement of force, unlike the kilogram, which is a measurement of mass.
Current technology: we can measure the force of a light beam in Femto Newtons...  Sir Isaac Newton: uh... beg your pardon?!
I'm surprised that electrostatic force balance doesn't get a full cleanroom treatment. Even talking around it opened up without a mask - a little spittle could leave a residue somewhere and stuff up a measurement?
this guy actually made me interested in this. Nice job
my dumbass thought we would actually see you pushing the little thing with a laser
how do they do the subdivision for the test weights? like do they just have a bunch of ~500g weights and then just try different combinations against the 1 kg? or do they somehow alter the weights if they're too big or small? (cuz I can imagine shaving 1 mg of a 6 mg weight or something might be difficult)
I wonder if gravity forces change over time thereby throwing off these standard measurements of weight.
This man is wonderful to listen to. I'd love to have him teach
This video is fantastic
Bro out here, measuring how much of a femboy, Newton was🫡 doin' gods work
5:28 yeah no duhhhhhh it's so obvious what do u think I'm stupid?????? Like I'm sort of baby?!?!?!? So easily seen.....
- What do you do for a living? - I'm stretching DNA molecules!
Well this explains how Ligo measured the force of gravity waves from the merger of black holes
"Why would anyone need to measure these forces?" he asked the man brandishing a balloon.
This guy is a rockstar.
Finally! A machine to measure the number of phucks I don’t give.
humans are incredibly smart
I want to know why he was holding a billon at the end, if it burst He'd loose half of his sensors.
Dr Shaw is just inspiring and so full of energy 🥹🫶
idk how i got here but i love it
He reminds me of Cuz Parry from skate 3 i love it
What the horse waste are freedom units? Surely not the imperial stuff that messed up in space.
The most accurate weights are in the form of coke. Prove me wrong.
i get the pov ness. but i alwaYs think its funny theres a guy filming Veritas filming
This is one of the coolest things I've seen in a while. Thanks for teaching me something awesome
0:40
Ishhhhhhhhh.......,......
Is that a reference paper clip?
Question: A laser exerts a force on an object, so, does the laser emitter propel itself in the opposite direction of where the light is emitted? What happened to the photon being massless?
He will have to clean all the scales and weights after talking over them maskless for a episode before they are used again micro particulates.
What is the background music that appears at a low volume from 12:18 to 13:29? It's good, but the mobile phone recognition app can't recognize it 出现在12：18到13：29的音量很低的背景音乐是什么？挺好听的，但是手机识别app识别不了
The weight and math would change in different gravity forces. like the moon or mars. all your stuff is wrong there
cut that part in half, now u have something smaller
that was great in many much
Imagine if you dropped one of those weights. AAAAAAAH 🤣😵‍💫
dude how boring is that !
Literally nobody American measurement system: that might be 69 Ariana Grande or 20 hamburger 👀👀
Like that scale is really that sensitive to see an increase in weight if it were a dust particle on the 1000kg weight
"freedom units" hahahah i love u man
Mr. Shaw is one of my dad's closest friends. Him and his family are really as wholesome as portrayed in the video. Glad to see hes finally getting the recognition he deserves.
Wittle weightw
-34乗……計測能力が狂気的すぎる
This guy: This is the most accurate  Also this guy: 10 micro newtons-ish
I like this guy 👍👍👍👍
He's here ! the cameraman !
I want him to measure my weed
NIST is super cool, no doubt about that.  A lot (most?) of govt is crap, politics is blood sport.  NIST (NASA, and the military), the US govt does/did a very fine job, something to be proud of.  I wish more people knew what "big" US govt R&D is all about.  NSLS/Brookhaven, Fermilab, Argonne, Goodard, JPL, all amazing people doing thankless work that will last forever.  I very much remember PPL (Princeton photon lab), trying to get fusion to work.  Wow, talk about a thankless job.  But...if it works!
Yo, this Dr. Shaw guy is dope. I really wanna hang out with this dude!
The tiniest force in the Universe would be the one pushing me to get up and go to work. It's usually equal to zero but on some sunny days it might fluctuate. Which reminds me of getting a new curtain. 😀😀 Seriously, love this channel!
still not as small as my brain
I feel like i need to make some joke about the measurement systems in here but I can't quite figure it out! Can you help?
Dr Shaw, thank you so much for getting me into the physics rabbit hole on YouTube when I have the covid!
I love how a professional metrologist attaches "-ish" to every word
It’d be nice if Derrick & the Veritasium crew would also be thoughtful of people of USA- and yes in 🇺🇸 we unfortunately weren’t & aren’t taught the metric system in basic public school (that I’m aware of anyways) although most of us know how to calculate it for understanding . However not simply adding temperature measurements for the 🇺🇸 viewers in also FAHRENHEIT instead of only CELSIUS, is obviously discounting viewers in 🇺🇸.  This isn’t a debate of how countries that use the metric system actually somehow believe it’s the U.S. citizens that are dumb instead of understanding the obvious that the U.S. gov’t isn’t interested in giving any extra taxes or attempt budget cut to any other bloated government over spending to switch over to metric but yet somehow it’s logical that the 🇺🇸 government can send millions of the U.S. citizens tax $ to other countries while Americans aren’t being appropriately represented or taken care of by those taxes.
Yeah but.. what was the balloon for!??
0:20 "if you wanna measure a force, like the weight of an object" did you just say Gravity is a force right after making a video explaining how gravity is Not a force?  contradicting yourself here.
Freedom units 😂😂😂
I love seeing scientists talking about their subject with this much passion. Highly inspiring.
Where's their 28 gram reference weight? 🤣
The kilogram in that tube changed over the years because of decay and some other stuff so really it’s not the most accurate
That was actually really interesting so cool  to listen to him talk
His guy has cracked the code to happiness. Ur awesome man, explaining things with such energy and simplicity.
Derek. I love your videos. One of the most researched and we'll structured videos on YouTube. Thanks for sharing knowledge 🤌🏻
Nothing better than watching an individual who is so passionate about their profession.
Dr. Shaw reminds me of my mechanical engineering teacher. He looks so enthusiastic talking about his wonderful job and it really shows he loves what he does. Couldn't be happier for the man, Big up for him !
support your troops made in america and india
I thought I was smart but a bit before the 5:30 mark. You lost my ass on the equations.
Ya know, for such a seemingly intelligent guy, you would *think* he would realize that the PAPER THIN PLASTIC "HARD HAT" WOULD DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO PROTECT HIS HEAD OF THAT LID FELL ON TOP OF HIM!😅😅

I came to leave the same comment as everyone about how charming and excited this guy is to show off his gadgets. What a cute guy!
This is so crazy
Can someone ELI5 what measuring absolute gravity means and why it was important for the lab?
No  thank u derek, i loved it  and also felt wonderfull see the other guys enthusiasm ha!
The guy looks and sounds like a nerdiest old nerd in USA both in a good and a bad way, and he is awesome
Did u know that the thickness of sheet metal is measured using beta particles and a Geiger counter
This dude was so excited that he was able to show off his hard work.  good for him!  His passion is infectious.
It's funny how you can't touch it because your finger oils (fingerprints) would make it weight more.
Doesn't the weight of something also change depending on their location? some parts of earth may be less dense than others. centrifugal forces near the equator.
welp, this man seems to love his job lol
Damn, this really brings home the awesome difficulty of physically creating and weighing these incredibly small masses. I will never take mass standardisation for granted ever again O_O.    This is one of those precision measurements that global industrialisation and scientific research relies on, on a fundamental level, yet it just goes on quietly in the background. It's like accurately measuring time; you forget just how much the world relies on that knowledge.
Can we get more of Dr. Shaw?
So, is there an equal and opposite reaction?  If so, is the force of the laser pushing the object equal to the force of the emitter being pushed in the opposite direction?
Why did he say g = 9.801 m/s
He looks so excited to share all this amazing stuff with us :)
we’re all stoned
I love this guy's energy, his excitement is infectious!
The biggest question left.. what was the rationale on WHY the 1kg physical weights that were all around the world were brought back to Paris and then were different weights?  Did everyone’s test weights confirm something was off? Or was each site confirming all was well? (Though while obviously you wouldn’t want a inconstant constant, just curious)
Dr. Shaw: "I've completed my greatest work. Behold the 10 μg weight! It took a long time to develop and it is so precise tha--" *Sneezes* Dr. Shaw: "Nevermind."
0:21 Someone corrected me last time I said that and said I should say "mass" instead of "weight"? 5:12 Planck's constant is not constant.
That’s what she said
This guy really loves metrology
This is so cool. I would love the type of work they're doing
This, and a video of a guy taking a carpenter's level to a body of water, got me thinking about how what we think of as "perfectly straight" might actually be impossible to achieve.  Conceptually, if you make the carpenter's level long enough, and assume that it touches the surface of the water at every point on the level, then the level would be curved and that curve would match the curve of the earth.  A laser going off into space is the closest we can get to "perfectly straight," but even that would be affected by the warping of space time as it left the gravity well of the earth and as it passed by any body with significant mass.  If you shined a laser across a body of water, allowing it to touch at only one point, could you assume that it was the perfect tangent to the curve of the earth, or would earth's gravity be enough to measurably bend the path of the laser?
9.801 probably changes with relation to large nearby masses. It would be interesting to have daily gravitational measurements for more confidence in our definition of kg
Dude with the ponytail has such great energy. I want him to DM for my party lol
FAKE FAKE FAKE.  YOUR CHANNELS BEEN DEBUNKED FOR PSEUDO SCIENCE.
Ah yes, freedom units
Dr. Shaw truly exhibiting the hallmarks of a god-tier super-nerd in the best possible sense.  If you find yourself in your career, working with anyone that shows even a glimmer of the same  passion and thirst for knowledge as Dr. Shaw - count yourself lucky.
I wish I had just a tenth of his enthusiasm and passion.
I love how at 6:05, this incredibly accurate machine has a zip tie on it😂😂😂
I can never work in a 20C temp lab.
This gentleman was a pleasure to listen to.  Thanks for the video.
Thank you. Watching your videos feels like attending a lecture at a prestigious university.
It’s not stupid it’s called freedom we can do what we want, you’re stupid the only thing you know about is science. Probably won’t ever do anything great. Freedom hater
Unbelievable, awesome guy
Proof that America is just stupid lol
They tried to measure gravity with space time, but being stupid, they failed to realize that you can measure space time on earth because space and time are connected, one cannot be measured without the other, so all of cern’s supposed measurements are fake, and I can prove it
That orange hard hat is absolutely necessary, in case someone drops that microgram on your head.
This is very interesting. I couldn’t help but thinking what would happen if they accidentally dropped that smallest little one, it would be lost forever unless they saw exactly where it fell and got lucky lol
Dr Shaws excitement about something so seemingly banal to the layman is infectious. I've never been this enthused about the metric system.
This man needs his own channel , he is a natural 😂
Amazing science! 💡
america fr said “we want to be different so we’ll just use the thing everyone else uses but make it more difficult to understand for people outside our land”
I absolutely love listening to people talk about things they are truly passionate about! You can tell this guy loves what he does for a living and enjoys explaining and telling others about it!
amazing we can measure these tiny amounts of force!
This dude is so into measuring tiny things i love it!
Gordon just set a new bar - and he's probably already measured it to insane precision!!   You could feel right away the love and passion he has for his work, and let's not forget - the confidence as well! For me the confidence in his delivery and answers to Derek's questions really sold me on how much of a professional he is! Wish him and his team all the best in their work!
Coolness
dammed buddy you need to see the meeasurement f universes and you start to feel low <3
7:54 9.801 meters per second SQUARED
Freedom units FTW
Does that mean light has mass
9.801-ish meters / SECOND ?🚬🗿
when I was a kid, a guy from my church worked at NIST and he took us on a tour there and showed us their atomic clock and server rooms. it's only more than a decade later with all these NIST videos that I'm starting to realize how awesome of an opportunity that was
Haha brilliant!
The standard reference mass should be made digitally available! An electrical test over the internet to calculate balanced-state. It could even automatically adjust the lever arm for micromethod.
This guy is so excited. I loved watching
Its crazy..I had never imagine that weights would be like this
Actually big Lasers create a Force similar to 10*10^5 Pa. That‘s like a Pressure Washer…
Is there a force of people looking at you? Is this why I get a funny feeling that someone is looking at me?
hahahaha freedom units.
What is photon pressure? Photons have no mass, and thus have no momentum. No?
Nicest head protect that I saw
8:48 deez nuts laugh
finally a measurement for feminist power
sheesh humans are fascinating...
Does NIST have a Yoctometer, and if so how do you calibrate it?  FYI - The average US Money $ Banknotes weigh 1gm each depending on whether they are intact or not and how clean it is.
Freedom Units are measured in Bald Eagles (BE's). And that varies cause of the Bald Eagles' big dump truck nuts.
Guy in the red shirt loves his job and knows his job. He's probably never worked a day in life while being down there.
When they weighed them, did they use the same weight scale/ machine/ method to weigh them?  If any of those changed, I would attribute the changes in weight of the kilograms to these things. I'm no scientist, just using common sense. At times common sense can be wrong and I also don't have the full story, so who knows why it the kilogram replicas were changing.
I used those test weights when I worked in an army lab and had the same box. If I remember right that set was like a few grand.
Silicon sphere?
Just a thought. e=mc^2. So, apparently, the warmer an object is, the more mass it has. To get an accurate mass reading the different weights should be all the same temperature.
Learning from people that are this enthusiastic about what they do makes it actually fun to learn new things.
This guy truly loves his job, that was awesome
12:03 Imagine the energy your DNA receives when you are bathing in the sun. Do not forget your sunscreen people. Stay safe
At 4:45, what can be the explanation of a mass standard getting heavier in a constant manner by time? The other way around, radioactive decay would be a good explanation of different amount of isotopes in standards though...
With great respect to NIST and the work they do, I have to say, this is the perfect place for someone with OCD
I immediately liked the guy. but then I noticed keens on his feet and thought: respect! he knows the shoes
"Freedom units" 😂
Do ISO next!
Bro said freedom units
I worked in the semi-conductor realm and we used vacuum chambers (reactors) to grow our wafers.  This dude's lab seems to be on the same level however no one is in a bunny suit.  No one is wearing gloves or masks or glasses.  I didn't see them walk through an air shower.  It seems to me there would be enormous amounts of human to anything contamination in that lab.  Measuring to such a small degree seems like it would demand to be more careful about contamination than just using tweezers to pick up the standard weights.
I always used Al foil if I wanted to get fairly rough, but accurate low value weights of less than 1 gram. They usually show the thickness of the foil on the box, or you can measure it with a set of micrometers mine cost $5 from aliexpress and match up with my set of feeler gauges to within 3% down to 10 microns or 0.01 millimeter. So, knowing the thickness of the foil, and the density of aluminium, I can cut 1 square centimeter pieces (or smaller) with a razor and get pretty accurate weights. As accurate as I can cut them. It's a nice poor-man's method for making low value weights. Just be sure to take your errors in measuring/cutting them to size into account. Vernier calipers can help a lot to make accurate measurements for cutting.
One of the most accurate labs in the world still add “-ish“ to the end of words that should be accurate 😂😂
One thing to keep in mind any time somebody uses the word vacuum there’s no such thing as a perfect vacuum the matter how hard you try there will always be something inside
wow this is amazing
bro said femto-newtons like it was just another word. Oh my god man, if you knew the gravity of that word you would understand why my jaw dropped to the floor and stayed there for the rest of the video. Bro really said "and that is a femto-newtons of force :))" LIKE HELLO? MY BROTHER JUST SAID IT LIKE IT WAS NOTHING OH MY GOD
The tiniest force would be second to second gravitational fluctuation, the liquid in the core is the greatest fluctuation, oceans and water movement, the moon, sun, planet movement change gravity continuously in a big way vs the even small gravitational fluctuations in interstellar space.
I can see how he loves to explain this technology! Nice content
you have that "touch" I love your videos
Looks like a basic heating and cooling effect to me, what proof do you have it's the laser not the heat generated?
Amazing video, but I got lost how they use laser to measure small forces, it would have been nice to have more explanation of how this device works.
1:00 I can picture this man having the same facial expression while torturing you.
Amazing video. So cool to see a guy who is so excited about his job. Nicely interviewed and video quality with all special lenses was super good! Thank you @Veritasium !
this channel is gold Jerry, GOLD!
The voice crack at 1:13 lmfao
I had a beautiful set of weights for calibration of the scale under registers at grocery stores. When I worked on registers. I had to be certified and so did the weights.
0:52 FREEDOM UNITS!
not shure if i am correct but america was fighting the british so they should call the metric system the freedom one
I love the way how Dr Shaw is excited like little kid showing off his new toy.
Doesn't the Van der Waals force intrude anywhere here ?
The kilograms from Paris sounds like some Power Ranger shii
He has such a soothing voice!
Anyone else here because of their penis?
Which country is blue??? And who is responsible for randomly swapping out the kilogram in 1945?!?
Doesn't temperature also play its part ???
This was one of the coolest videos I have ever watched one youtube
This is where "alpha's go to get their penis' measured
Two right angles exist on a perfecly level horizon, obviously parallel, at what point do they stop being so?   Can you construct an experiment so we can visualize the results?
I've order certified weights from NIST many times. As sample size increases the standard deviation of the means decreases. So if you're weighing something in the 10 milligram range uses you can't use just one below an one above the range, there are other standards in many industrys like ISO 9001 which require more and more data points, some times 5, I've even seen some that require 7 and your correlation coefficient to be greater then 0.998.  I'd be interested in knowing why the standards were getting lighter,  could be the mass lost on earth to solar winds?
Tactical comment to feed algorithm with quality content.
And million times million is billion aka one Mega!!!!!!! Angry engineer!!!
One thousandsth of an inch is one micro inch.
My mistake: n*1/2
Americans can not get rip of 1/n thinking Why?
Shoot I have a friend that can eye a gram from the next room
I love Dr. Shaw's enthusiasm. It's contagious. You can tell how much he loves his job and physics in general. What a cool guy!
I love this guys energy!
That was cool af. Thank you Derek. I would never be able to go to the places and talk to the people you do. You are amazing!
I loved this guy.  He made me feel what he does is utterly important.  Congrats dude, you rule!
You know
A process called subdivision...
Measuring femtoNewtons could be used for measuring gravitational constant (G=6.67e-11Nm^2/kg^2) more accurately. I wonder if they tried it...
This is literally how money is going out of fashion
That guy is cool as hell
This is great!
Just thinking about how that platinum iridium international kilogram was the only object i lived in the same lifetime as with infinite sigfigs....
Just let the cameraman be the cameraman
The only thing I want to know is why he was holding a balloon at 12:15 😂
7:20 If weight is related to earth's gravity, then the deeper you go underground, the stronger the gravity is.
9:25 I'm pretty sure its one of his facial hair " beard"
Glad to see someone who likes his job.  So many people are wishing their life away. “Wish it was Friday” specially worse if it’s a Monday even worse if it’s Sunday night.
The Gabe Newell of mass and scales
Thank you for this video.
This is such a pointless channel.
So two geniuses really think its hard to basically use a magnifying glass? Tight.
i king of want to work for NIST now, currently doing micro-inch measurements. Precision measurement is very exciting and it takes a load of skill and knowledge.
This is what having your most passionate career looks like. Seriously. Bravo to these scientists, they make humanity look better
If the 10uf glowed...
This gent is such a pleasure to watch. He is so clearly passionate about his work!!!
This guy really looks like he enjoys his job. I'm so happy for him!
👽The human soul weighs 22  glards.
He is using photonic table as something else, what a waste
Freedom units cracked me up haha!
Amazing Concepts .  Thank You !!!
FREEDOM UNITS
You guys demonstrated nerves' of fiber with extraordinary meaning.  Maxima minima, your egar passion in all videos revolutionize the world of wonders around me. THANK Y'all.
It’s fascinating to find out about something few people know about and it’s about science presented in most interesting way possible. I love your videos!
He'd be the best teacher, so clear and enthusiastic. So happy to answer questions. Fantastic!
Nist is really great except that determining why buildings fall
What if the brush you use to clean it has dust on it LOL
Am I mistaken or only at the end of the video it's mentioned, btw, that they are in the NIST lab. Kind of strange, I was waiting through the whole video to figure out where this was actually filmed
I've been learning Blender and I heard subdivision and my eyes lit up lol. Obviously different terms with their on context but still made me smile.
I like that he used the tweezers to pick up the paper clip
I love this man, and i'm so happy for him because you can just see how much he loves his job.
I visited a lab that provides calibration services to, amongst others, the South African government (where I live). They procured a set of standard weights for a government department, verified that they were accurate and supplied them to said department. A couple of weeks later they received a complaint that the weights were inaccurate. They asked them to return the weights for inspection. When they opened up the case with the weights, they immediately saw the problem: Each weight had been engraved with a government asset number :(
Fascinating.  Great video.  👏Dr Shaw.
What a great guy, he really loves this stuff. Makes it a delight to watch, 10/10 video😃
this is so good!
Is it possible that the place where the original ( and all the replica) kilo masses were made had some trace elements of a radioactive substance. Which over a very long time would decay and release some of its mass as energy?
I am now wondering if Dr Shaw has measured a Planck mass = 2.176434(24)×10^−8 kg?
Why's he wearing a bump camp but no one else is
You will pry my freedom units from my cold dead hands globalists!!!
I have to say, this guy looks perfectly good to take out for a beer or two and yet you can sort of sense just how damn smart he actually is. :)
He said "you know" 20 times before 4 minutes. Low iq blob
Yess! It's stupid! HAHHAHAH
Amazing knowledge held in this man’s mind, I’m glad he’s so keen to share it with such enthusiasm!
*grams* Sorry, I don't speak 'countries that haven't walked on the moon'
Is it just me or does he look like Gabe Newell?
I'd love to know more about the isolation techniques used to prevent interference when measuring at the femtogram scale.It's hard to imagine that a person just being in the same room of that device wouldn't cause interference of some kind.
Canadians laughing in metric units,  Americans, somehow after conversion, also laughing in metric units
Nah I think ima use pounds and feet
People like this man inspire people every day.
Nerds
I really enjoy listening to someone explain something they are so enthusiastic about.
an ever moving shape.. rarely can it sit stable .. make one
heat hasz mass how can light not
Conversion to "freedom units"... 9Gagers call them "retarded units".
Dr shaw, you're amazing! You made measuring weights interesting and graspable for everyone! Lots of cred to you!
"freedom units" lmaooo
Metrology really is a beast of a field. NIST do some awesome work.
-ish
I made a gadget using a laser beam tied to a long strip of steel spring, 1mm thick and 300mm in length, one end secured to a base, the other end floating, and I placed a piece of paper 3mm x 3mm and could see the laser pointer deflect by half a mm projected on to a wall about 4 meters away. I call that pretty cool.
7:49 The closed captions say "perimeter" instead of gravimeter.
You can feel the love for his job, he speaks with such passion for it.
A milli gram is not a millionth of a gram but a thousandth. That is one part of a thousand. The professor got excited at 4:08.
The kilogram is no longer defined by the metal cylinder. It is now defined by the plank unit using an electrical resistance machine called a kibble balance.
They knew the masses would diverge cos of background radiation if nothing else. That was a futile exercise, trying to make a standard based on objects in today's world of precision engineering
well, that was a trip
The best kind of YouTube videos is where you find an expert who is excited to tell you about the thing they're the expert at.
Berserk reference 😳
waht would gordons degree be?
They need to convert KG to freedom units.
1:27 Meanwhile every pothead knows that a nickel weighs 5 grams and to check their dealers scale with it.
I WATCHED IT!! OK YOUTUBE?!!
I loved his safety helmet :D
As said at the outset -"this is stupid", seemingly referring to the kg and metric system.  You mean it's not as sensible as slugs and lbf?  When I can easily recognise weight and volume through kilograms mass and litres in volume, then who's the slug?
Oh this is why I love science videos, I wish I could get my loved ones to appreciate it
Who knew Comic Book Guy was so knowledgeable
That is another proof that we are living in simulation. Plank length is the smallest pixel. The rest is just measurable probability.
Thank you for your videos, Dr. Shaw looks like a kid in a candy shop
Can't believe u guys use the KG and then covert that to pounds. Why? LMAO
Why i cant get sleepy with these videos at night when i need to sleep?
this guy is so passionate its great!
You can tell this man is very passionate about what he does. It was a joy to listen to him.
The real question is what makes such a big difference in the quality of nails of Dr Shaw's hands , 11:05
Awesome, so why USA & UK are relying on gallons, pounds, miles etc?
Freedom units sounds  Ridiculous.  It is.
i like how happy this dude is.
Do a research on VR too
Imagine how cool the job must be for you to casually move a chair, point at a small drawing on the ground, and go "oh yeah that's where we measured the gravitational constant literally everyone uses".
Imagine showing this tech to people from 200 y ago, its like pure magic.
We had these in every lab in Russia for chemicals
Does a flame have weight?
I don't know this guy and I 100% trust him with the accuracy of every single scale in the US.
Come on Dr Shaw, do 1ug
The Force is DEF with this guy! 😎
0:50 is it really that hard to just use the metric system
Could you do a video on Roman concrete versus regular concrete?
Can you please tell NIST to give us an open API for their chemical webbook? Thanks and also thanks for the video.
I’ve always wondered the force of rust. The same sort of test but instead just have rust growing under the scale.
tiniest forces can be measured by electronic methods. calitrons can measure all tiny mass amounts. it can seperate isotopes of atoms. you need a vacum chamber and electrons.
That guy is so passionate about his work!
hes been waiting for this moment for his whole life
Wow. Applying pressure with a laser.... 😳 ''head goes kapoof''.
I would love to see a video about the difference between bubble level ( consistent with curvature of the earth) and laser level (geometrically flat).  How would a flat plane, that is bubble level in the center and hundreds of miles across, be affected by gravity?  If you filled the plane with water, could you have a pool without walls?
I love how obviously enthusiastic this guy is about what most people would consider to be a completely esoteric science, little knowing how critically it effects absolutely everything in their lives.
I really liked this man and his willingness to share. I wish I could have a chat with this guy and witness the edge tech
The laser that they measured the force was continuous wave (cw) or pulsed ? I know laser pointers are CW, but what I don't understand is that how a CW laser can make that silicon thing vibrate. 😵‍💫😵‍💫
what is heavier? a kilogram or steel or a kilogram of feathers?
Wonderful episode 😊
What a great scientist!
Sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo stupid.
I'm surprised they aren't wearing masks and ful suits, considering how much humans spit when they talk, not to mention how much skin dust we shed.
This dude doesn't lie about his height and weight on his driver's license...
The US should be metric, otherwise what is science?
Metric system... well well... 😀
Dr Shaw seems to be a bloody nice bloke.
There's some scratches on that weight man. I know they're small but imagine the impact.
13:07 🎯
Precision measurement has always blown my mind. Usually physics documentaries just casually mention an amazing measurement related to a broader topic and never explain how it’s accomplished or how the process/tools work.
Love this man! Was entertaining while being educated the whole time
Measure laser force? Another learned lesson :) Thank you
I really love how happy he is to share knowledge about what he loves. That alone makes this video a thousand times better than it would be already!
He is so cool
Fantastic Video and interesting topic.
gabe n no?
I wonder why isnt this a clean room requiring full body coverage and face mask
I LOVE NIST!
Dr. Shaw's voice sometimes slides into something like Seth Rogan's voice.
This video was fantastic, and made me want to spend a day at NIST nerding out.
This is wild. I've heard of machining down to microns, and I regularly deal with tolerances below half a thousandth of an inch (0.0005) but this is next level precision.
Veritasium discovering kilogram lol
you just could go metric, couldnt you?
I like how they take a jab at our ’Mur’can Freedom Units, which is one of the first modern standards, then pretend that the unit of weight in the metric system is not impractically small, such that the physical standard, the kilogram, is a thousand times heavier than the basic unit, the gram. And the whole thing is based on someone’s random weight of two pounds and some change.
This video can confidently be called, minutia
Ant 🐜 power punchers be like now's my time to shine.
Really interesting topic. I loved the passion :)
Legitbait
US scientists use non-retard units, who would of thought.
Gordie is a great guy
Now try this with your freedom units guys 🤣
Woah, with tools like that I bet he could even measure the size of my dick...
I love how every expert in your videos are so passionate in their fields
This guy really believes in his stuff. Admiral for someone who has such passion for something like that
The amount of force on my window glass exerted by the 5G signal from my local cell tower is 8.378751247638124372028064828769e-22 Newton. f = E / v. Energy was obtained from converting RSRP-NSA = -96dBm. v is speed of light.
"Freedom Units" I would have used a different F word to describe the US system of measurement.
Dr. Brakish Okun IRL
Why do US use the freedom system and not the metric system?
"Yes, with great trouble" Hahahah, I could listen to his knowledge all day!
This is so interesting. These guys are like, beyond smart.
The issue of mechanical friction does not affect readings?
I’m pretty sure my iPhone can see that spec of dust
I wonder what the force of photons from the sun in a vacuum is like. Like, one of those crazy high school science graduation exam questions where, "given the speed of light and planks constant, what is the Newtonian force of the sunlight hitting the atmosphere of the Earth?"
Very cool !
Ant-man’s world
That was a super cool video. Thank you Dr. Shaw!
The standard of mass is now force. Got it.
12:47 I'm blinded now
I could listen to that man talk about measurements and forces for hours and hours and hours
nist is one of the main groups (with the other being the united states government) that told a lot of the lies about how the wtc towers "collapsed"... i wonder if this guy was really on the up and up?
"gravitational force" 🤣🤣🤣🤣
does it also loose weight over time? due to decay of the mineral used?
it would have been better if the guy didn't give the wrong value of  gravitational acceleration.!!!    s/b  9.806
so, photons  DO  produce a reaction force.?      maybe you should revisit the explanation of how a photometer works.
Not a minute in and I'm already rolling on the floor laughing.... secretly metric and freedom units just killed me! 😂
Great episode! But... WHAT WAS THE BALLOON FOR THERE AT THE END??? 🎈 🎈 🎈
man I love this guy
Judging by the comments, your actual job, Derek, is to find and interview passionate scientists.
Great to see how passionate this man is about his work, really kept my attention and interest!
Please, can u do another episodie with him? I loved it so much
I was like: i want to see the 10microgram object. I wish they brought the probe lens and then they did. Thanks! :)
Why does YouTube censor complaints about the increase in offensive ads? But the BS propaganda fake ads are even more disgusting. Censorship can't be for profit. NO SALE here. Just harassment ads and lousy blackmail.
I thought photons were massless. What's PUSHING?
Living in the US is so frustrating. British Imperial has meaning to me (meaning I have a frame of reference), but much of the time I end up using metric anyhow. I've taken to changing everything I can to use metric instead so I get a feeling for it as well. Ex: thermometer on my car dash, converting non-metric recipes so I can use a metric scale, getting metric graduated measuring cups, etc.   Not strictly metric, but I've switch all of my digital clocks to 24 hour as well just to make it familiar to me.
I love his passion, makes him sound like an excited Schwarzenegger
Isn't Gordon just John Favreau with a white beard?
Really enjoyed the guest commentary this episode. A clear and excited voice, excellent language skills, just really excellent all around. He was fun to watch.
"Convert to Freedom Units": The rest of the world be like:
i love how none of the comments are about how crazy it is to measure something that small and all about how great this guy is.
The science of measuring is fascinating.
Yes, it's stupid that we're still stuck on the Freedom system; but in our defense, pirates keep ruining our attempts to convert.  And besides, look what we've accomplished; imagine what we could do with a REAL measurement system!
i would like to have a beer with that guy.
The fat doc's eyes are literally burning with passion, kudos!
This guy makes me think of Jon favreau
Another application is the measurement of hierarchically structured materials. At the nanoscale you need these tiny forces to get any results
I LOVE hearing experts speak passionately about their fields. It makes my scalp tingle.
This man has entered a new level of nerd, He is extremely excited, extremely knowledgeable and extremely helpful in interoperating a whole lot of science into something anyone can understand. You'd be very surprised how hard it is to explain how things work easily when things are very complicated. Some of the smartest people in the world have a difficult time simplifying explanations.
Wow that guy really loves his job! You can really tell when somebody is passionate about what they do. Good on him! Great to listen to.
Dr. Gordon Shaw would be a great cocaine dealer.
All I heard was a scientist trying to solve man-made problems. Isn’t that the problem?
"Freedom Units" That's fresh :/ ... Not! Should really be called "Lazy, I don't want to learn or use something far more simple" Units :/ :/ :/ Grrr!
One thing I love is seeing videos like this of interviewing phds who have spent their entire life being possibly the only person interested in one hyper specific field. They always seem so excited to share their work.
After seeing this guy,I'm certain everyone who works there are just grown ass kids with high iqs living many children's dream.
Why's he got a million dollar machine and a Walmart hard hat
What an amazing explainer Dr. Shaw is. I love how he got excited when Derek mentioned he brought a special lense!
Don't the weights lose mass when you pick them up with abrasive tweezers?
Too bad NIST did a terrible job on 9/11.
7:47 asbestos tiles eh? ;) This was a great video!! So much things I didn't know.
10:38 ... Wow, that it's astonishing and amazing to even consider. I never would have guessed in a million years that measuring anything that small would even be remotely possible (without having quintillions of them weighed and then divided).
do one on the nist crypto beacon
Dr Shaw #1 seems like a cool ass dad
I also do work for the government for the past couple of decades and yes the underlying code we use is all metric and our results are metric.  We apply the final "freedom units" for the public.  Actually, look at the military, everything they do is metric too.
I love love love hearing people speak on work they're passionate about, especially very smart people doing good science. Gosh, what an absolute delight this man is, he reminds me of Adam Savage a bit in mannerisms and the way he speaks. Thank you for sharing him with us, Derek.
Dude is awesome. Big respect.
His excitement is immeasurable.
Auto focus... what happened to real cameramen? It's a good and interesting video, just let someone do the filming.
loved this episode!
That was fun to watch! These videos just have me hooked from beginning to end
You: *ask a scientist a question* Scientist: *points balloon at you* That's a good question! Fav part! Also very good video thx very much
Take that Americans!  Absolutely fascinating video!
The measuring of the force of laser light enables very accurate propulsion of tiny space faring light sails to a % of the speed of light. Making travel to our nearest neighboring solar system possible. This is Very Important Work. Thank you to all who expand our knowledge!
"The uncertainty in the mass of a standard kilogram is in the order of tens of micrograms"not that small considering that's all the mass you need to get high off LSD
El nivel de pasión por compartir el conocimiento de Dr. Gordon Shaw es inspiradora
You can tell he's really passionate about his job, live the energy. Nice video veritasium
Does this guy run the whole lab by himself?
Kilograms are not cylinders. A kilogram is a measure of weight, and a cylinder weighs one kilogram, so a kilogram is a unit of weight.
5:41 I don't get something. If m=hf/c^2, why when He put number instead of letters it turned into m=c^2/hf? SRY for my English, but I hope my question is understandable.
ish
Could you imagine if you just had one thing left to measure for the day and you could go home and you dropped the only 10 micro gram weight you had haha
cool to see the weight fluctuating depending on the graviation of the earth and the lava moving below the ground I assume
Derek's smile when he completely nerds out about stretching DNA is gold.  Thank you. That made me happy :)
My professor for metrology explained it quite nice: In a car, to get a good seal and work properly, the piston can have a (hypothetical) tolerance of 0.1mm. To make that part, the lathe it was made on must have a tolerance of 5um. To make that lathe, there is a special procedure and machine that can make lathes and has a tolerance of 0.1um. And to know that that machine and procedure is even working, you need a lab and scientist, that can measure down to 5nm. If you find a way to to that measurement down to 0.5nm (which might seem totally unnecessary), it's only a matter of time until the car will have a piston with 0.01mm tolerance (which can enable higher compression and better efficiency).
Here's an idea for an alternative name for this channel: Nerds at Work.
This guy's great on camera!
It might be stupid but I prefer building in Feet/inches and to those that say but metric is more accurate 1/32 is 0.79mm 🤷‍♀️
🛑⚠HELLO VERITASIUM 🛑⚠WARNING YOU NICE CHANEL IS FLOODED WITH SPAM. This type (so stupid) > "You have been selected for my Draw kindly send a message to the telegram above name to claim prize..."
Dude said, because science!
freedom units? you shouldn't encourage stupidity man.
Is there anything to measure the smallness of the "Best Interest of the United States" concerns of Congress...?
wow this man is so excited telling about his work. fascinating!
1:29 > _"ah aw maybe with tweezers, aw yeah, if you don't mind"_  i like the caution he showed lol
Thanks man.
Trust me, I know just how much force 10 micrograms can have
Cool 😎
Ok, why not just use an exact liter of water then use that volume to divide? I'd imagine it's easier to measure volume rather than weight. Maybe I missed something.
Hallah with death? Maybe? You know, maybe death God leave alone maybe so that we can make known things, like all people, not idiots maybe?
WERE METRIC????????????????????????????????? WHAT THE HELL IS A KILOMETER!!???
When is someone gonna stop these scammers?  Every time I leave a comment on any channel I get the “You won a scam” notification. I always respond with the middle finger emoji with no response. It’s annoying and hope these kids don’t fall for these scams
Can you .measure human attempts on Chi and telekinesis?
That's a true nerd, I love those people
Wow, pretty nice thing about the measure system, glad to see your video
Why was gravity not 1 but 0.98? Is it related to the llsvps and mantle density etc? Or because they are underground?! Now I'm on a tangent!
I was spectating showing a laser being measured :c
9:40 - I wonder if he wears a face mask when handling things that small?  The slightest breath on it might blow it away and it could be lost.  Even taking the lid off the petri dish might lose it.
Now try to measure the strength of a 5w lightbulb
Amazing stuff!
Love when people are passionate like this. Glad to have someone like this in charge of the important stuff because you can tell they really care about their work and how important it can be
What's the whole point of measuring such small weights .
this channel is the only break i can get from political/ social propaganda. Thats a compliment to me, i really hope you can release videos more frequently. I love your stuff bro!
09:02 when Derek says "I brought a special lens" and Dr. Shaw replies "Uuuuhh special lens!!!" exactly as a kid would do, was priceless!  He works in THAT lab surrounded by million of dollars of ultra specialized tools and he gets real excitement for a camera lens. What a man!  Loved every microframe of this video :)
Been trying to convince people to go with the metric system for years. Never knew we did in secret.
Dr Gordon explanation and passion is off the roof, im loving it.
My dog learned to count using the Kibble balance... 🥁
I absolutely love when people are passionate and knowledgeable at their work.
Wait so lasers can stretch my dna
Okay, so I admit, I think I spent most of this video laughing at the absurdity of the scale of measurements and measures. I legitimately thought we only ever considered these values academically, not physically measured them, and I cannot get over the sheer scale and accuracy. Thanks for taking us on this trip because it was truly fascinating and impressive!
Remarkable how some people are so intelligent.
You deserve my Like. Amazing work
MURICA IS METRIC BUT WE CONVERT TO IMPERIAL, or how you say it, FREEDOM UNITS, that is not what we call it
This man would make an excellent professor
🤠👍
so if he is saying that it only takes one Newton meter to distort the shape of a DNA molecule, and a typical pocket a laser pointer can exert a force of seven Newton meters, does that suggest that a laser pointer could affect your dna?
Next picture 1 microgram using a banana for scale
What drew your attention to this particular firld of research?
Wow
so why is he touching the femton scale with his bare hands and putting fingerprint oil on it? there must be some way to tare the process.
I need to know what he was doing with that balloon at 12:15
Yeah, one nerd in a lab funded by money taken at gunpoint says that America is on the metric system. Nevermind the hundreds of thousands of trades people who use imperial every day. They're "stupid".
awesome
finally i know how they measure my meth
"Yes. It's stupid". Smug mthrfckr.
I love the passion this guy explains his job.
Most of it went over my head, but it was a joy to see how passionate this guy is for his job. I envy that.
I have been looking for this all day. Thank you very much.
That dude really loves his job, you can tell :)
So where exactly was this produced and conducted? Because supposedly, the closer you get to the Poles of the 'Earth', the more gravitational effect you feel (by around 6-7%?) - meaning there would be huge variations depending where you are in the world? If the base standard as shown here, is measured in only one part of the world, it'd be wrong?
This period actually has weight then ------->   .
But there is a problem with precision: The mass of the operator influences the gravity very slightly. And the gravity and its gradient is also fluctuating very slightly. Here in Finland the geophysicists have a supergravimeter which measures the gravity with an extreme precision. Nanogals actually( one gal=1cm/second squared).
stupid pee-lon husk dick rider
brings me back to my college days
He is so excited
I loved the juxtaposition of a hardhat, and "about 7 piconewtons" of force.
difference between weight and mass .. something that keeps to be ignored as usual I'd say as seen in many cases ... you can be underground as much as you want, ... yet also, tidal forces are ignored as well as far as I can see in all these "measurements", ... an interesting study, however would be to explain the drift of the Paris reference "kilogram" from the samples that were made
I hope this Dr watches this video and gets to see how everyone loves him, genuine excitement in a subject just makes other people engage and enjoy it so much more which is amazing.
That is real passion on his eyes. Amazing!
I love how the guy is wearing a hard hat while dealing with the tiniest of weights and forces. 😅Safety first!
this guy absolutely loves his job. i have no idea what he said but it was somehow the best video ive seen all week. on my way to binge more. see you in 10 hours
10:04 why do i feel identified..?
no way usa is metric and folks still fight which is better 💀💀
As anyone on the internet, I’ll comment before watching it. You need to test the laser force in a vacuum!
It's awesome seeing how passionate Derek is about this! Great video😊
I love how enthousiastic scientists can always talk about their work. It's so interesting!
I love this stuff... My brain forgets almost instantly though. :(
You can see how Dr. Gordon loves his work. He talks with such fascination and enthusiasm. Rare occurrence but is very pleasing to see when someone enjoys and loves its work. Nothing worse when you have to spend 1/3 of your daily life somewhere where you absolutely hate and don't enjoy being but have to because... You broke otherwise.
and what if we take an airgel, 1 mg of this substance will be much more than stainless steel.
LOVED THIS VIDEO SO MUCH!!  THAT GUY WAS AMAZING!!
then yes!  they use the metric system, interesting
He deals with fN level forces but never forget the hard hat :)
0:46 haha! How can the imperial units be "freedom units" ever since the revolutionary war - based on the length of some monarch's foot?! Niiiiiiice lab, so much cool and mighty expensive gear there. And interesting lens too.  I wouldn't expect the car industry to go down to femtonewton range, but science - oh yeah. Particle research, all that stuff - with lots of hypotheses still untested just because instruments precise enough haven't been made yet.
But why?
Wrong title, it should be How To Measure The Tiniest Weight In The Universe. @2:12 Why Chemist working on weights instead of chemicals?
You were forced to hand over everything to a mugger via Lazer Pointer? Lucky to be alive man. God bless
I love, love, love the fact that all the top comments here are about how passionate and enthusiastic this guy is. It's great to see someone like that, and just as great to see how appreciated he is.
I request you to make a detailed vdo on " Bose Einstein Condensation State of matter". . I've watched a lot vdos ans articles, research papers available throughout the world, , , but no one could satisfy my confusion? No one could clearly explain what kind of characteristics does a matter at Bose Einstein Condensation State ( Hyper cool). Does a matter loose its magnetic identity also? And what uses are there of this state of matter for human welfarism? . Please. . And , , is there any place naturally where matter reaches to this state without any outer/ man made environment or force??
Definitely easier than changing the timing chain on a modern car. LOL
us humans are pretty mind blowing…
can you please do a video about CERN
Eck,  would it be helpful to recop some of you money by all of us using our PC's to play some of your videos using one of your large playlist overnight for several days??
its funny to see how arbitrary the mass of a kilogram actually is when you see the algorithm for the constant lol.      but i am fascinated by how the original weights could have diverged so much and so differently!  thats crazy.  the only thing i can think is that its rubbing off the molecules on the bottom of the weights from friction depending on how often it is used in different places (being used different amounts)
He says he can get down to femtonewtons with that gadget, and then says the laser is actually applying 7 piconewtons of force to it. **That is 7000 times more force than a femtonewton.**  This needs clarification.. can the thing measure femtonewtons or not?  **GET HIM BACK ON** :)
Didn't we move away from the standard weights? I thought we calculated the standard kg based on water now...
That was really entertaining. I hope he gets to witness some large breakthrough :P
what a passionate man. loved listening to all of what he said
0:35 missed the older animation used in the videos about the big K, locking it under Paris.
"Any speck of dust can affect the measurement" Talks and shouts without a mask spitting saliva particles everywhere and uses no hair net for that Rapunzel mane and then he says that's the most accurate in the world. Ok...
fascinating =)  no scientist here but its kind of cool how these things are done,  BUT... THE U.S. IS NOT METRIC!!!!!  thats blasphmey =P lol🤣🤣🤣🤣
Why don't they use this for an EM drive?
I love this guys passion!
There's More to life than this
Postmortem
I wish I had a dollar for every time I heard this stuff 🤔
学习
I thought someone would mention the trator ray technology in the video
Gordon is great. You can clearly see how he loves his work and is passionate about it :) We need more people like Gordon :D
Just science at its best <3
Awesome guy awesome vid
AFM cantilever tips are worth about $100 each and they are easily lost if the sample is irregular and they might crash on the surface. They are made from silicon nitride and the "diving board" is actually just the HOLDER for the tip, which is atomically pointed to have a surface area on the order of single digit nanometers. If you crashed the tip it's easy to see because the whole diving board will break off and be lost somewhere on your sample, again this is just the holder for the tip which probably requires SEM to view properly. Installing the tips onto the microscope is very tricky, easy to spoil them. They are $100 each so that is motivation to do it properly otherwise that money will be gone in seconds.
I have a question for you  What is the distance between real sun image and virtual sun image ?
I have a question for you  Atmosphere bahave which type of lens ?
12:13: "Can I ask you the big question?" "Yeah yeah, let me just pick up this random balloon, I think I'll need it" "Why would anyone need to measure these small forces?" Sadly puts down balloon... "Yeah, that's a good question"

His enthusiasm in this is infectious. Make the video really captivating
you wont need NIST to measure how much enjoy your videos ty
I work in the printer industry, actually designing ink jet print heads. A typical droplet has a volume of 3-4 pL (that is 3-4 * 1e-12 liters). We can measure flying droplets with a fancy high speed camera, using rediculously short laser pulses. So the volume of a droplet can be measured very exact. Now. We know the bulk weight of ink (or water for that matter). So we know the mass of a single droplet. This weight is way, way more smaller than a microgram. Such a droplet is of course not suitable to be used as a test weight. So: just for fun this comment.
Loved this video - the passion Dr Gordon has is so cool to listen to!
When he showed how to measure a Femtonewton my mind just went 🤯
Veritasium: making a video about precision measurement, and measuring forces in order of Femto newtons.  *Meanwhile* me in exam : lets take e=pi=3, and round off to 0 digits of decimal
🤓nerdy nerd, jk this video is amazing man
As a fellow scientist it's cool to see these enthousiastic passionate researchers all over the world doing their small part for the advancement of science and humankind as a whole. Keep up the good work there!
11:25 But wait, photons don't have a mass right?! How is that thing moving because of light!
This dude out here super excited to show off his laboratory and just nerd out. Married and all…here I am still trying to figure out what he was saying and wondering why I’m single.
Fancy Feast cat food? Neat.
Dudes really good at explaining things
Could listen to Dr Shaw all day, one of those amazing peoples where they can explain everything with no jargon!
I love how the last and most interesting application of being able to measure tiny things... is it lets you develop more accurate ways of measuring... so you can measure tinier things... so you can develop even more accurate ways.. so you can measure tinierier things... etc.. etc..  I love it
I wish to be as passionate a scientist as this man.
Thank you Dr Shaw!
I have been asking that laser question for YEARS and people kept telling me they could not measure it. Awesome video.
Fascinating. 11:55 Given that visible light can penetrate the skin, it would seem that even a green laser pointer could go deep enough to stretch out DNA, and a red laser even deeper.
The force of light stretching a DNA molecule.. WOW..
He was a great presenter thanks that entire video felt so short as I was enjoying it all the way through. Fascinating topic
This guy sounds very proud to show us what he knows. Love these kind of guys!
I really like this dude, he's great infront of the camera and you can see his passion for what he does. Those are def the best people to learn from.
Dr. Gordon Shaw is so amazing and so passionate.  Very clear and pertinent explanation. It really was inspirational listening to him.
Great guest.
Gordon got my attention for the whole video. Love the passion!!
I love it when science YouTubers find people who are deeply enthusiastic about their work, it makes the videos so fun and interesting to watch.
Make a video about cancer, please.
I'm sad I took so long to watch this. The video was fantastic and super interesting. The guy you interviewed was well spoken, passionate, and just so excited about sharing that passion. This is a really interesting topic I'm going to share as a great standard for science videos.
I didn't hear firefly in a Fairytale again. :(
I really like how in this video every time Derek says: "Oh wow, science is really freaking hard to make" Gordon goes: "yeah"
Thank you Seth Rogan
I love this dude. I could spend all day listening to this lad talk about mass measurements stg
This guy is the kind of guy you want to sit down with a beer and listen to him all night about his passion.
it feels kinda crazy to me that all this wasn't in a clean room. if they need to be careful about single specks of dust, wouldn't it be dangerous to stick your face in the most precise scale in the world and talk into it, covering it in spit?
6:23 Why do they have so many nuts and bolts around the perimeters of those round portals?    Why not use half as many?
ارجو منكم وضع اللغة العربية
Filming the guy filming, now we need someone to film the guy filming the guy filming
I have a question for you  Which substance have similar property as well as  electromagnet induction
i love how gordon is so excited to talk about that topic, which made the video 10 times better
“Yea it’s stupid” -.- only dumbies can’t see the implications of a simple change. Glad to see how our most educated people have little clue or interest where thinga actually come from.
Watched the sponsor block to the end because of the funding of these brilliant videos of yours!
The beings who designed the simulation we all exist hate guys like this. They're probably like, "Gah, that dude in Simulation 506c keeps approaching the limit of fidelity of the program! What a pain!"
Shame that Americans at large and not smart enough to use the metric system especially with temperature it's so easy
Why don't you revisit your vanity fair video on Musk? Do you still feel the same now as you did then or have you liked the rest of the world realised what a grifter he is?
What id find fascinating to further explore as to why exactly did the weights deviate with time, assuming they were all taken care of meticulously. That is bizarre, the material chosen would obviously be as stable and inert as possible, while hard enough to not just degrade by itself, so why did these differences exist? whats causing it, and why is it different between the regions
Easily one of the coolest episodes
NIST? ist't that the same place where they have the peanut butter?
Derek: I want to capture this...  I brought a special lens
Scientist: "It's the most accurate in the world" also scientist: touches the sensitive device with a pen by pointing to it
All those people like Dr. Shaw are like hidden giants making sure all everyday things like market, banks farms, mines..... society as a whole, works in a most fair way possible.  And also thanks to You Derek, bringing all those people into light , 🤠 off and a humble bow 🙇
Cool video! loved it.
"Freedom units?"  You're kidding, right?  Apparently a lot of people will fight for the right to be ignorant and stupid.
that man enjoys his job so much, glad to see that!
So, with so much said, how much force does a fly generate to lift off and fly at 10mph?
11:58 that "yeah, oh yeah, yeah. definitely" reminds me of ADAM W😂😂😂😂
This explains a lot. When I use my laser cutter I can hear the object I'm cutting vibrate. Which is probably the PWM of the laser. Pretty crazy stuff
NIST in Maryland…?
More Dr. Shaw please!
This guy sounds just like Patrick Rothfuss, I love how excited he is
No we're not! Us tool makers in the USA only use English Standards for metrology on physical,  2D, and 3D data! This is blasphemy!!
This video has prevented mass confusion
Highly enjoy these random labs and experiments that hardly anyone covers. Millions of view just so the amount of curious people! Keep up the hard work!
Please help to benefit mankind greatly in doing Debunking to stupid Conspiracies/Myths that ruined/wasted a not small part of our would-be-more advancement in life eg. vitamin C, fake plastic rice, the 10,000 things that are wrongly said to cause cancer, ... Thank you!!
This man is so excited about his work, he's really trying to explain as good as he can. Love it
I love it when metrology makes it mainstream
This was equal parts wonderful and mind-boggling. Dr. Shaw obviously enjoys a true passion for his craft. Truly inspiring stuff.
This guy's passion is so contagious.  I wanna get a beer with him and just let him spew knowledge.  :)
i love how excited the researcher was, really makes you as a viewer excited about the subject too
i love how excited this guy is. id def love to work with him lol
Why does he call all the individual weights masses? They're 2 completely different meanings.
that guy really, really likes what he's doing and his euphoria it's somewhat contagious
A Laser pointer with low battery should be the tiniest forces in the universe
Search for "Elon Musk Multitasks Better Than You" on youtube.
Marvelous stuff. Thank you.
That guy definitely LOVES his job. And it's a super cool job!
Man someone should marry this amazing man. He is so kind ,generous and charming
Dr Shaw is a very good person , thanks for all of you !
That's awesome
If wholesomeness had a mass, I think Dr Shaw would definitely be one of the heaviest things in the universe  ! Dude is so happy about his job and sharing his job, this is insane x)
What an amazing and passionate man. Thanks for sharing :)
what an absolute dude
The passion of this guy is exciting!
I love the passion this guy has for his work. Great video
sex
Lovely content.
this is crazy...
10:04 thats what she said😏
It's uncanny how much dude looks and acts like Matt Groening. Much love.  It's also fun to learn that the United States is closet metric.

Hi Derek! you already saw the new track audio tool? You dont need anymore your other channels with different languagues.  Youtube allows you to change the track audio from the toolbar! .3
I want Dr. Shaw to know how easy this video was to watch. And how easy it was to understand his explanations. I also hope he knows that his concise communications were only overshadowed by his glowing personality, and contagious enthusiasm. This was incredibly interesting to see how the magic behind looks behind the curtains.
@12:18 Me in 20 years puts the balloon down to answer The Big Question
Oh... I thought this was going to be about the Russian military. I got tiniest confused with most incompetent.
you might feel 10 micrograms of LSD or fetynil
Dajjal tried to lure the people by false promises to get eternal youth and life and people with weak faith started to follow him very quickly. Muhammad Qasim Dreams
"freedom units" i love it, never calling it anything else anymore.
Idiots. One gram of coke weighs one gram. You could save a lot of money by just using grams of coke as a unit, and half a wrap of coke is half a gram. My dealer is frighteningly accurate. These fools could save a lot of money by getting my dealer to weight out wraps, and if they want subdivisions of that he could cut it to whatever ration they want.
I enjoyed Dr. Shaws' peciluar interest in picograms. But the *irony* of his body mass index was peciluar too.
Idea for a New "How to measeure": coastlines  I got info no one mas able to agree in measeure method
I love seeing people who just truly love their jobs and what they do. He has so much energy and seems excited to answer every question. Actually inspiring to see
:) i really like this guy haha
Still not sensitive enough to measure my will to live
I love how he loves geeking out with all this. So what do you do? - I make sure everything in the world weighs the same consistently.
so what about measuring errors in the temperature
It seems like he is still making a number of assumptions.
His hardhat was part of a Bob the Builder Halloween kit.
yet they cant measure my force of pulling girls 🤣😂
What a brilliant chap. You can see how the presenter is captivated by his intelligence, personality and ingenuity.
I feel like Planck is everywhere. I mean temperature, length, time, and now constant, he's everywhere.
Adam Savage would love this guy and that lab.
I feel like I enjoyed this video WAY more than was reasonable.
But that could be thermal expansion or a draft of air causing that movement too
THIS IS WAY TOO SHORT ! The subject is SOOOO INTERESTING ! Why did you made it so short and without introduction and conclusion ? Man you can go for 2H on this subject people will still LOVE IT ! I can't beleive you made it like that ! You are "Veritaserium", the only one, among one of the best on internet, so WHY did you just flight superciali over this incredible subject like this ? Did you got a problem with your recordings or with  your sound system ?
The force is strong with this one!😁
Amazing video. I love metrology. I wonder how many grams his ponytail weighs.
would the attraction of the moon,ie high tides change the results over a month?,bristol england where i live we have the second largest tide difference in the world,recording at those low numbers would affect results?
Metric is great for science but imperial is better for every day use. The Fahrenheit makes more sense than the Celsius
ACHOO!  Errr. Sorry.
I would never have imagined seeing American people getting so excited about Metric units
You know this guy loves what he does when he says "That's a good question"
by watching this video, I can't even imagine how difficult and challending work it is to produce calibrating devices. Thank you Derek for this amazing tube.
this dude is a gravity wizard. watching this cheered me up in a way I cant describe. thanks for the video love yall
♥nist
His excitement shows how lucky he is to have found his purpouse in life.
Love this guy. Would have been great to have Dr. Shaw as a teacher/professor in school.
Only freedomers would assume science in america doesn't use metric..
What's stupid is to think that base 10 is the best basis for all situations. Ironically, after making this idiotic statement, the video proceeds to demonstrate subdivision, which is pretty difficult to do if a factor of 10 is involved.
2:10 ... To No bring up How GRAVITY changes on earth with altitude and  stuff here seems like he wasnt. fully thinking ...  ... black holes are galaxian lagrangian points  by the way , looks like i was RIGHT all those years ago ...
It makes sense that the man in charge of standard measurements is like a "standard engineer". Seriously he's like an amalgamation of so many engineers I have met in my career.
9:13 that is not a special lens. that is a pornographic lens.
Freedom units... that's great. I call it the "Stupid system" as though that's it's proper name. Example: "Do you want that in metric or Stupid?"
I can confirm when I pointed a laser pointer at my chest I was thrusted down to the ground due to the constant masses of force impacted on my body at that moment in time.
You should get in touch with a company called LUMICKS. They specialize in something called optical tweezers; the type of system you would be stretching DNA with. It's a fascinating technology with which one can "pick up" polymer spheres using nothing but light and measure the forces applied to that sphere. The idea behind it was actually worth a nobel price not too long ago.
thats one of the most interesting things ive ever seen
There is no better way to spend your time than in the presence of smart, enthusiastic, and knowledgeable scientists
I want to know why he was holding that orange balloon.
This guy should be an NFL referee.   "After the measurement it's 4th down and 5.827 x 10^-3 inches to go. Or in metric that would be 1.48 x 10^-4 meters."
This guy seems to lover his job and be an absolute boss at it. Pleasure to watch, just radiating enthusiasm.
It's thinner than a pixel
How are they not in full clearroom garb!?
I used to work on deep UV lasers used in chip manufacture. Since the beam was invisible, we used a business card in the beam which fluoresced a nice violet color to make it easier to set up the light table to make our measurements. Once I leaned the card against the output shutter of the laser which was closed. Opened the shutter and watched the business card instantly fall over, thought to myself, LIGHT just did this. Glad to learn I wasn't seeing things, because part of me had a hard time believing what I just saw. Great video.
of course !!!! in pharmaceutical field we can't inssure that dividing a surface of a batch will lead to evenly distributed active molecules  across the pills, we would need something like this ... oh oh
The videos on how we measure are just so damn interesting, which very much includes the people that do the measuring.
2:17 why he is looks like van hohenheim
So much passion and hardwork in creating a scietific content like this, deserves respect. Keep shining Veritasium.
We can even measure the force of ionisong radiation with this instrument....
BS thru and thru. Blah but no results. Where is the measurement of the laser putting pressure on a mirror? Nowhere. Because then you would have to validate the energy-mass equation and that does not hold -- it is but a fantasy. And the biggest BS is when the author invites you to do scientific thinking. You may think you are scientist but science is built on the scientific *method* and if you do not hear the expression scientific *method* you are being fed crap, in this case the Veritasium crap. Sorry.
Derek you are one of, if not the best, science communicator on Earth. Well done on another excellent video.
We are also measuring small forces in the range of µN with our thrust-balance for FEEP-Ion-Thrusters, used to change orbit and position or do drag compensation for satellites! I love this!
sick
usa is now half based
wrr
I like how he talked about using new measurement allowing for scientific discovery that leads to better measurement. When you work with machining or woodworking (relatively old and well known things that regular people can interact with), you know that step one of making something flat is to have something flat. We've bassically spent thousands of years developing and refining the tools that allow us to precicely construct the world around us, and that's fascinating.
How do we experience time?  Is time relative to the change in our surroundings ,?  I mean that ,If there is no change and everything just stays the same on this universe , then do we still experience the flow of time .
This guy is SO passionate, he has absolutely made this video and has got me hooked.
I appreciate and congratulate the passion and dedication of this man for his work and readiness for sharing his knowledge. Thanks.
derek muller, you videos are amazing. can you also please make a video on any two artificial neural network projects that are creating a powerful impact in the society
More Dr Shaw !
Here's my Triplets Paradox, a situation which seems to defy time dilation theory. There are 3 objects in space moving along the same path, we'll call them objects 1, 2 and 3. The objects will always be the same distances from each other but those distances will become shorter as they move at their various velocities until they are eventually all together. The velocities are as follows: 1 is traveling toward 2 at a constant velocity, doesn't matter what it is for this exercise, it's just fast enough to make time dilation a noticeable factor. 2 is traveling toward 3 at the same velocity that 1 is traveling toward 2, and 3 is for our purposes stationary.   Here's what each of them see when they consider themselves to be stationary and the other two moving. 1 sees 2 coming toward it  and 3 coming toward it behind 2 at twice the velocity of 2. 3 sees the same thing as 1 saw but with the roles reversed, 2 coming toward it and 1 coming toward it at twice the velocity as 2. This part was simple enough, as regards time dilation.   Now comes the part which makes it a time dilation conundrum, or paradox. 2 sees something entirely different from what 1 and 3 saw, it sees both 1 and 3 coming toward it from opposite directions at the same velocities. That means it sees both 1 and 3 as having times which are equally behind his, meaning passing at a slower rate than his own time.   Objects 1 and 3 would not see the other two objects having equal time dilation factors relative to him, they would both see the closest one, object 2, having one time dilation factor and the farthest one having double that time dilation factor. The question is, do the three clocks show three different times or do two of the clocks show the same time and the other clock show a different time which is ahead of both of theirs?
This is how the double slit experiment actually works. Its a play off of Crookes Radiometer. The pressure of the laser causes the slit to resonate its like an opera singer singing the resonant frequency of a glass. The slits then resonate as expected and cause the photons to deflect off of the resonating blades, string etc.  And the reason why we prefer the imperial standard is that while metric is good for measurements, it's application would be retarded. Try tuning the electric grid to the metric scale. A foot, a minute, a year all have the same thing in common: easy of application, you can subdivide it by 1 2 3 4 or 5 in the case of 60. 12 can be subdivided by 1 2 3 or 4. This was understood since back in the days of sumer. How do we pretend to not know this?
may the force with us
Zero mentions of silicon wafer productions regarding the measured force? 😥
I was just about to ask that ….y would I measure Sumpn this small?
Nice, I like your videos bros!
I wish i had a friend that was so into something like this dude
This guy was made for youtube, he's so good! Hope we get to see him again here one day
What actually is behind the lazer's force, is it the velocity of the photons or is it something else?
It’s kinda weird watching someone point a camera at another person while being filmed by another person.
I love gabe newell
Styropyro has joined the chat!
I know this ight not be related to the video,But am I the only person who wants to bite Aerogel?
Nah fam this is too much work, I got this mate whose dick really tiny, perfect to use for ruler.
It’s not freedom units it’s weight of a fully loaded ar-15
Dr. Shaw's love of his job is obvious...  he's a lucky man!  Measuring the force of a laser pointer... that's amazing!
"Freedom units" that are literally called the Imperial system because they were defined according to British royal standards. It's so strange how the USA is wedded to British royalty in this way.
Oh.  So it's a really big deal that they will likely redefine the second here pretty soon.  Sweet.
Now I want to know... how powerful of a laser would you need to push something like a car?
I like how the most sensitive measurement capable instrument he has, he has no problem picking it up and bending it by hand. I’m sure this guy knows what he’s doing, he seems truly devoted to measurement. He’s obviously using some wacky system but that’s all right.
Still not sold on metric
5:19 you lost me there
I wonder how this can be used in astronomy or in space.
Finally we have a method that can be used to measure the small size of Biden's nuts, and the thinness of Nancy Pelosi's spine!
That good is amazing with what he does and knows.
Dude sounds like Penn.
I'd love to see a video showing the chronology of it. It's so mind boggling humans are able to measure things so accurately.
Neat
He’s so happy to see the little mass measures on the scale because when he steps on it it’s a couple trillion mg.
If it was worrying you as well - he's reminding you of Jon Favreau
Absolute...ish. lol
is this devon larratt? 12:49
Necu
That bearded guy is the American version of Boris Johnson lol. The way both of them speaks are so similar, except the accent, and also this guys is intelligent.
Fun fact: Our eyes emit energy. You can literally feel the resistance in your hands when you hold up a piece of printer paper and look at the middle of the paper.
I loved his energy and excitement. Seems like he really loves his job and really enjoys it. So enthusiastic.
ever heard of Casimir force?
The "kilograms" in question are chunks of metal intended to have the mass of a cube of water measuring on each side one hundred millionth of the distance from the equator to the north pole along a meridian through Paris.  That the USA uses one of these chunks as a mass reference standard does not mean the USA is "on the metric system."  If the USA were on the metric system, then surely Derek and the other Paris meridian people would stop whining about how the USA is not on the metric system.
I just spent 15 minutes listening to someone talk about measurements and it was the most fun and exciting thing I've watched this week! Brilliant example of how to make a subject fun and engaging to a lay audience!
This guy was great, so passionate and knowable in his work
now I know I was able to actually feel a laser pointed at my forehead as a kid and not just imagining it. Or maybe I was imagining it lmao
i love this dude, just so passionate about his field. i aspire to be like him
me: "what do you think?" her: 10:04
That guy *loves* what he does, he's a pleasure to watch
If everything is undergound, doesn't that change the relative air density enough to alter the weight relative to surface level measurements? Also, it's closer to the core of the Earth which increases the proximity to the dense gravity of the center of the earth. This is why I measure nothing.
Doesn't stainless steel still oxidize to some degree, increasing the weight/mass?
Had a hair on my screen in the exact spot...went to swipe it without thinking and thought it was under the screen for 2 seconds
bro, 0.01 error is 1/10^2 not 4
Sub'd because of this video and this scientist.
Anytime someone tells me the temperature in Celsius, I tell them to tell it to me in freedom units. FREEEEEEEEDOM.... despite how I already do the conversion in my head.
I love his enthusiasm, and the fact that everything was visualized. Amazing.
Amazing institution, their work is the base of modern technology
this dude in the lab is a really smart dumb guy
Dr. Shaw is amazing! Love seeing content like this from people like him who are so enthusiastic about their subject! All the best to this man!
this man measures
I have a scientific question, if I would stand on the most accurate scale and lets say I'm 80kg, if I take a deep breath would my mass increase, decrease, or would it just stay the same?
I don’t understand how they can have a metrology lab be so accurate and not be wearing clean room gear.
I FOUND GABEN NEW ELL
That was a joy to watch,  not a fake excitment, but the thru passion, it brings happiness. Thanks for creating this.
Very interessting stuff. I used to work in the swiss version of NIST (METAS) I even built a device for the NIST. Really excited to see that building from the inside XD
Bless be to the amazing intelligent people like this who are the infrastructure of our world.
lets just hope nature is keeping the electro magnetic force equivalent in ratio compared to the gravitational force.
F%ck the metric system.  What?  They can't handle diversity of measurement?
This was almost like a Tom Scott video
Hey, Veritasium and that other guy...Do you thing we really care about how much you love the metric system?
I had a professor who used to take granularity measurements as his primary job. The gravity of the moon was enough to throw off measurements.
Space dust increases the mass of earth by a 100t or 100.000t (don't remember correctly) per year so that has to be taken into account too.
SO LIGHT HAS MASS ??? 😳😳😳
12:18 "That's a good question", the imposing bearded man said thrilled, wiggling his cylindrical balloon with hemispherical ends in the process.
So now we need a video to tell us how the USGS can measure the acceleration due to gravity to an even higher degree of precision, and with a portable instrument.
That lab likely develops WMD'S
5:42 Mass being described as "Joule Seconds" blew my mind
Couldn't we have defined the kilogram by some atomic mass?  Maybe pick an element that only has one isotope.  Gold and bismuth come to mind.
Is that a radioactive static brush?
wouldn't the tweezers scratch some of the material off?
One of the best episodes ever,  We need more Dr Shaw in our lives.
I love this mans enthusiasm
Just ask my cousin to punch you. You will the tiniest force in the universe.
I can't wait to see you and Destin do videos on the recent fusion reactor success.
I hope Dr Shaw is reading all these heart warming comments about his enthusiasm in explaining his work at NIST and it strengthens his resolve and motivates him further.
He confirmed how 'Merica stays number one @ 0:50.
Why avoiding thermal expansion is important for weight measuring?
whats heavier? a kilogram of platinum/iridium alloy or a kilogram of feathers? Edit: wow, this is really interesting lol. I'm currently studying automotive engineering and as soon as he started talking about the practical uses of this it really hit how insane it is. Science is cool.
"DNA molecule"   He is a really cool dude though
where goes the force of i point ur laser to a mirror ?
So Derek, what's the count on kilogram videos now? I feel like I've seen a few of these
I would think masks and clean room procedure necessary in this room. What expensive and perfectly crafted equipment. A hair, dust lint, skin flake, or  saliva bubble...
Does the weight of a wire change with how many amps you're putting through it?
This man really likes his job.
That was cool, thanks for sharing.
Do they have to account for variables in the earths gravity field, such as the movements of the moon?
I hope one day I can explain my line of work with the same passion as Dr. Shaw.   Great video!
-ish
I can remember using supersensitive scales in University. Air currents and vibrations could send the reading all over the place if you were not careful to close door and ensure that there was no vibration.
This guy is so enthusiastic talking about his work, watching him talk is a delight
that scientist is so excited to share his knowledge. he is like finally found someone who is interested to know this stuff.😆
Wow. How amazing is that? Gordon is so enthusiastic and full of joy to share his work and knowledge. His work and research is so valuable for our modern societies. IMHO guys like Gordon are our true hidden heroes of our times. Chapeau.
he is one of the most genuine and happy and excited man ive ever seen
Nice!
Hi Gordy, I've met you at SEM a couple of times, nice to see you here. You are an excellent ambassador of science good sir.
For everyone that complains about how the scientific realm is full of cheats and charlatans and "secret agendas"... this is what pure science looks like. Defining the standards from which all scientific achievement is sprung. If scientific advancement is a cake, this is the seed from which the wheat is grown to produce the flour for that cake.
Surely you didn’t just set the energy of a photon (massless) equal to the energy of a massive object
Another great vid - but you know, I’ve stopped counting. Keep up the good work D. Every little bit helps me to build my mental model of everything.
I could listen to Dr. Shaw explaining stuff all day.
Glad to see Wozniak has found a good career path after apple :)
Doesn't he sound like Keanu Reeves??
...    Wow.
I thought this was going to be about the weak nuclear force and stuff
These are the great people to talk to, exuberant, passionate, and utterly dedicated to sharing their knowledge for the betterment of science.
The 6 in the last digit of the scale wakes the sleeping OCDness inside me
For someone who spends his days dealing with accurate measurements he sure says “ish” a lot
I'm gonna need that thing to measure my flower. I never get it right and this is the next logical step from my 20 euro scale.
I am curious in the first place how do they make the milligram standard weight?
Wow, that was fascinating.
So this guy is underground all day weighing stuff or is he the security guard?
Dr. Shaw's enthusiasm made me smile during the entire video. I only realized I was smiling when it was about to end.
loved Dr. Gordon Shaw, thanks Derek
so much respekt to this smart ass mtfucker!! :D :D I have a problem to tie my laces and he is measuring pikograms :D :D
lbs and inch is suck
That's a good question 🎈🎈🎈
1:13 back to puberty
You should send this to Destin's dad! :)
6:39 why is he wearingthat cap?
Ey İNSANLAR  SİZLERİ ISLAM'A DAVET EDİYORUM. 'LA İLAHE İLLALLAH MUHAMMEDURRASULULLAH'deyip KALBİMİZLE İMAN ETMEDİKÇE DÜNYADA DA AHİRETTEDE KURTULUŞ YOKTUR.
I wanna play DnD with that dude
Would love to see more from Dr Shaw
This guy is awesome!! His passion is contagious..
this channel shoud be mendatory in all schools across the world. great video again mate. BTW dude incharge of this operations seems super exicted and passionate about what he does, great explanations mate.
Man who tf payin fo this shi fr tho🤨
Dr. Shaw made me happier
Great man and genius engeneering ❤️⚡❣️💞
Im really glad he asked the why at the end
Just switch to metric already.
Metric is used for physics.  Life doesn't have to be lived in metric.  Gallons and pounds and feet and fahrenheit are fine for human interactions.  I'm a Canadian living in the U.S., proud that the population here didn't let themselves get bullies into the "everything metric" nonsense.
10:42 I didn`t expect that information. :O
Dose the earth's constant vibration from the crust, moon gravity, or the air pushed from your mouth when you talked, can affect that femto-scale meter largely? You know, the seismograph constantly get a vibration on the earth likewise.
Very practical to create blocks to caibrate   medications scales
For a man making very accurate measurments he sure does say -ish alot.
That is a a sign of a true expert: unbounded passion for his work and enthusiastic about every question he receives. The world needs A LOT more people like him. What a great episode!
Interesting..
Damm, I love your videos man!
Ask Ivanka what the tiniest force in the universe is.
The visitor tag in his jeans 🤣
metrology is not only the science of measurement but the measurement of science. The progress in science is in lock step with metrology advancements. The reason we have so much nanotechnology now is that electron microscopy technology has made the small scale measurable. If today picometer microscopes suddenly became as common as nanometer microscopes there would be a technological surge tomorrow. I don't think it's an exaggeration to say  90% of science is measuring. The other ten percent is preparing something to measure.
I'm amazed by the number of comments who mention his "passion" for this. I've watched many of his videos and the comment section doesn't look the same. Is it due to herd mentality? Serious question. It almost looks like recent media coverage about Musk that shows every network and huge amounts of individual Twitter users opting for the exact same keywords and descriptors. It's creepy.
i see it if we use light as propulsion force in a vacuum
I love scientists
Started with talking about the kg and didn’t even mention the worlds roundest object 😔
That’s pretty interesting 🧐 , so how much does a fart 💨 weight .   LoL 😂
Love this guy, what a passion!
The thing that makes me happy is... Once all the boomers die, the US will try finally to make the metric system their official system.
I like the fact nobody talks about the bottom right of the screen.
Compliant mechanism doing the job again
This channel is too smart for me
the guy is an excellent teacher
How old is everyone watching?
You are a really passionate man with awesome looking hair sir!
one millionth of a kilogram is a microgram mr. science!
We have 4 Advance Research Laboratories on campus and had to put two of them underground so that we can control temperature to 0.01 of a degree and provide the necessary amounts of RF & microwave shielding. Many of the lab spaces also have vibration dampers. That is why we are to measure so accurately, less "noise."
wow. It was amazing as always !
The tech they use to keep us in the matrix is crazy
Seth Rogan but make him a scientist
The only thing I was wondering about the whole time was how much does the red shirt guy weigh
We do a lot of conversions from SI units to Imperial units, but a "milligram" is one-thousandth of a gram, not a millionth of a gram. At 4:05, did I mishear that conversion? Otherwise, I'll have to rethink a microgram! Great video, thanks, and keep them coming.
This man is the goat
I was hoping that in the post credits .. Veritasium, he would take the 10µg and drop it... and then replace it with a hair of his .. so no one would notice. Then a NASA satellite would appear that scientists would not know why it went out of orbit ... 🤣🤣 Great video .. THX...
Seriously. Thank you for this video. While a bit over my head, it was still quite fascinating. 👍🏼
So you didn't ask what the weight of a finger print was?   Shame....
This guy is a true legend
I still find it funny the US uses units that we call "freedom" units.  The foot was at many times in history based upon a ruling monarch's or emperor's foot--naked or shoed.  A monarchy being the exact type of gov't the US fought with for its freedom. I like his statement about how  more capable metrology helps science.  That's exactly how Brahe helped Kepler.  Brahe didn't do much in the way of new general scientific ideas and theories, instead he focused on better measuring instruments and data collection.  It was his assistant, Kepler, that went on to use all the data to forward scientific understanding. The best part is his nonchalant tone when he says they can measure the force of a laser pointer like it's no big deal.
0:54 is my favourite part
It’s not stupid we use feet and inches and pounds… those measurements have been around for literally thousands of years 😂
Destin's dad and this guy should have a sit down talk about all the small things they've measured over the years
loving this guy
This really needs to become more prevalent in the channel. Whenever i see a person excited to work in field i had no idea existed, it makes me grounded and realise what we're on this planet for.
The two guys from that lab look like they'd have been the type of children that would've pulled all manner of gravity related pranks to freak out the parents. I love the first guys comment to Derek when he says that it seems crazy the entire US isn't metric system. "Yes. It's _stupid_"  Now, wouldn't that be something to get Fox news undies undulating - if the Dem's said they were going to turn the nation metric? Only half a century after Aotearoa-New Zealand but hey, gotta start somewhere. Don't you?
when youre looking at he 10 microgram thingy - wouldnt the light from the room and yor camera make it 0.001 heavier/lighter or something? just asking
Wait since there are very small (magnitude <2.5) earthquakes happening almost continuously across the globe, won't that shaking be detected by the sensors...?
One of the most important, yet most hidden jobs out there, until now, that is.
I was a scale technician for 14 years. I worked with scales from tractor trailer down to analytical balances. This is a completely different realm.
Wow. This guy presents his subject really well. He's a pleasure to listen to.
Very interesting video, thanks for making Derek!
One of your most fascinating offerings.
Mind. Blown!
So cool to see someone excited about the work they do. Got me into it!
I love seeing people who are passionate about what they do. I hope everyone can find something to be passionate about.
Wonder how much the pin of a ryzen CPU weights, some people solder them by hand
That guy was awesome. You notice how energetic he was about talking about something he was interested in.
I don't know about all of this. How do they acct for other sources of radiation?      Light in the room, gamma rays, earths magnetic field. Gravitational variations from people or even cars driving by. At the scales being measured here, they all would need to be accounted for.      There's no way to prevent 100% of "stray" radiation from effecting the measurements. The Moons position would massively effect it all.     "Mass" get it?  Moving on.     I know how interferometry works & at the scale of "gravity wave" measurements, how could  one know which of these fields is being measured.      Even the mass of the electrons is the measuring equipment must be accounted for.  US paper currency weighs 1g $1 bill, $5 bill, $10 bill etc.    Each individule bill, 1g.       He is wrong!    The rest of the world uses the U.S. Imperial measurement system then THEY CONVERT  that, into metric!
dude you could sneeze in the same town as that scale, and it would flip out.
If someone wanted a job as a precision metrologist, what would they do to get there? I think metrology is the real way to advance science and that the availability of sensor technologies should be pushed much further than it already is.
That's so funny, I just put in my application as a research chemist at NIST hahaha
If the force of a laser pushing something can be measured, can that given number be used to measure the one way speed of light?
Fascinating
all this precision to calculate the mass of sperical cows, physics is weird
The passion here is real, feels good !
01:13 voicecrack
With a tiny tape measure of course!
This makes me want to drop my career and go do a PHD with that guy as my teacher.
has anyone realized that the reason these original weights are deviating together at a nearly constant rate may indicate the the EARTH's mass is also changing over time? :D
can we get an extended cut of this? I wanna hear every word this scientist had to say! He's cool
Glad to get that off my chests...if the sun really made hydrogen ...we could go hydrogen farming in other star constelations😃
Someting like positron decay plus 2 electron plus ..close proximity in the presence of rediculous gravitation pressures?
One time at a drum circle this dealer tried to skimp but then SWIM broke out his electro static force balancer and settled it right then and there.
I was wondering if pure solar wind from the sun could contain hydrogrn..and if so...could the sun be producing hydrogen rather than consuming it?
I read they claimed the hydrogen came from solar winds and asteroids
Hey there friend...got a question...did you see the chinese article about finding water on the moon?
Thunderf00t fat father?
So like, hypothetically you could measure the force of a laser pointer?  Oh yeah, been there done that already, it's 7 piconeutons   He has an answer for everything, you love to see it!! 😂
I've always known medicine is milligrams or micrograms. But I never thought about it as a weight. I always assumed volume. Don't know why. But it's extremely Important that they can measure that. It also tells me, there's no way they do it accurately every time.
amazing as always! great channel!
Petty -- I can't stand the video shots of Derek holding his digital camera with the big mic on it.
What a guy! Walking briliancy
Love seeing passion in everything people do that they're so interested in. These are the people (and institutions) that make our world possible.
Thumbs up for “Freedom Units.”
This guy is so cool
I like how there's a cameraman filming another cameraman pointing the camera at the guy
This was a great episode particularly for the enthusiasm of Dr. Shaw. I'm an Engineer and I've always been fascinated by and concerned with measurement uncertainty. It ties in very much with what I do in my job.
Yeah yeah yeah Derek we know the United States is technically on the metric system...but many of us in the US are tired of having the metric system shoved down our throats by you. When you call them "freedom units" we agree... Let us choose want units we want to use.
I absolutely love how enthusiastic this guy is about his work. You can see it in his eyes and I think he's doing amazing work. I love it all.
-The most accurate measurements are done in this lab -We measured the absolute gravity at 9.801ish
Wait.. It's all Metric system?  Always has been...
Using a nano-scale mechanical resonator to measure the force of a laser ? That's mind-blowingly awesome !
"freedom units"....
Shout out to Dr. Shaw for being a good hang whilst enthusiastically showing off his micro and pico newton measuring kit. My kind of smart human.
I like so many others I see before me, came to this comment section to commend the passion with which this man speaks about what he does, it's truly inspiring - and instills in me a thirst for knowledge. Makes me want to walk up to the nearest university, find a bored looking professor and ask them to "Teach me something, if you have the time."
For those interested, one may subscribe to NIST.
Why do you just recycle your old videos now? Thats lame.
Freedom units! 🤣🤣🤣
1:00 stupid Americans 😂😂 4:40 changing standard
I like, when he was asked " does this lab mean the most precise measurements in the world? " he said " yes , this ( motions to machine) does" like it would be so easy to say " yes ! MY lab is the best in the whole world "
Ok I'm more concerned about the fact they aren't in a "clean room"... (Clean room, meaning positive pressure, people are fully suited up, with goggles, to prevent dead skin cells and other debris). You'd think those machines would require that
So if my choice of making anything 5% larger was the kilogram... What would happen?
NIST is great at these physical things. Cryptography? Not so much...
the TRUE tiniest force is my punch...
Knowledge about these things has a special weight
6:30  Good thing he’s wearing a hardhat, near a piece of equipment that can take his arm off like the bite of a dinosaur.
pretty cool ngl
Dr. Gordon Shaw is a super cool guy who really knows what he's talking about and seems to love his job and teaching. Love to see it
just imagine if that hard-to-see 10 ug sample was made of Botulinum, it'd be enough to kill 100 human beings....
0:53 lol
I'm glad he kept his safety helmet on. Wouldn't want the 10µg to drop on his head.
precision measurement is cool... but it's even cooler to see someone as passionate as him talking about it! :)
I was taught that light acts like a particle but seeing laser pointer actually produce a force is unbelievable
0:58 the best part of the video 😆
9
I have a question - Why are these standard weights in cylinder shapes? Why not cuboidal or cubes?
So basically the people in the US should stop using these silly values and weights, and start using what the rest of the world does. He explained it full of passion, great to see and watch.

But steel is heavier than feathers
👍🏽👍🏽
Freedom units 🤣🤣🤣
I really would appreciate if people didn't call them Freedom Units. Stupid name used only to indulge in american exceptionalism. If anything, the metric is a child of the French revolution and as such much more "free" than the imperial system. At least call it US Customary Units which is their more technical name, if you want to avoid the "imperial" word.
Will this laboratory measure for pay? I have an incredibly small force to measure which, if I can show is there, would be a whole new branch of science.
This dude is great to listen to, and he has the enthusiasm we need in a science show.
11:46 For something that sound so precise and fragile, he sure manipulates it with a lot of confidence! He must know the tool's limits, but I don't think I would ever touch it without gloves, let alone force the movement it's calibrated to do when in use!. It could be a non-functioning piece tho
Here at VU University Amsterdam my colleagues use optical tweezers constantly to measure forces on DNA and other enzymes. And a company producing a (better) diving board like sensor was started. So I knew quite a bit about this already but it was a pleasure to watch, makes me want to meet this guy, he's so passionate about the subject!
9:22 He sounds so proud of it and so eager to tell us more about it
Imperial units are stupid, what more do you need to understand it?
So americans use metric but invented imperial system just to mess their head up?! 😂
The chemist seems like a wholesome dude who would totally have a few beers with you just to tell you all about his work. Wish I had more teachers like him.
hi can you make a video about phonographs
If u are reading this there’s a reason No matter how good or bad you have it,wake up each day thankful for your life.Someone else is desperately fighting for theirs🇧🇸
"Why does anyone need to measure forces that small" - best question (and answer) of my whole week 😁
Is this Jon Favreau?
Average americans are so lazy that they refuse to change to a better system because it would take a little bit of work. 😂
So it's like the Cosmic Distance Ladder but going smaller instead of bigger, One measurement method validating the next  measurement method.
This really puts these scales of weights into prospective and I can really appreciate the difficulty in measuring such weights. As someone who is currently compounding medications into the micro-gram range myself I've had to use similar techniques to be able to measure ranges with my limited equipment.
Perhaps this force measurements can be used to measure the gravity constant even more precise?
Love this
Mad respect for the dedication of Dr Shaw here. True inspiration!
The scientist's enthusiasm is contagious, he loves his work
idk maybe for Nanomachines, son
I think ninov's motivation probably was that he was a powerful ambitious artist who found the scientific scene dumb so he tried to play a game with the scientific world .
Lets make one step deeper! How do you know that the voltage on the capacitor is the exact voltage you want? Who calibrates the voltmeter?
Potheads/drug dealers know the first part of this vid in their sleep
I want to know what he was using that orange balloon as an analogy for.
That "ish" guy really is happy in what he does
I love how enthusiastic Dr. Gordon Shaw is about all of this
Well if anyone in the world thinks they might be capable of telekinesis, this lab is the place to prove it.
Well, im gona sound like EVERYONE else, but damn I like this guy. This kept me engaged from how enthusiastic he was and how well he explained everything.
I've studied exact sciences over here in Belgium. Mr Shaw would've been my reason to become an exchange student 😅  What a guy, his passion to teach and share his knowledge is affectious and unique and unmatched...
So cool.
He's got to say "ish" more than anyone-ish
Grabbing for my bones
I love how he's so enthusiastic about his work. I aspire to be Dr. Shaw.
wait..... did he just say  lazer  pointers can stretch  dna ?
Guy seems so happy. That's the dream.
1:14 🐓(sorry)
"Yes. It's stupid" ...Yes. Yes it is.
5 Advertisements came on while watching this .
It was mentioned but I feel was glossed over a bit - different places on earth have different gravitational forces, which affects how we measure forces. I'd like some more information on how they conclude that what they are measuring is accurate, based on gravity, or even the speed of earth's rotation.
2:46 ...and then two 125s, and then...you wish the SI ("metric system") were based on binary rather than decimal. :)
That guy is the kind of person I most respect. He knows his stuff and you can clearly see in his eyes that he LOVES it and could tell you all about it just for the fun of it.  Congrats Veritassium for another amazing video and congratulations to that guy for being such an amazing human being
I already absolutely adore this man, what a treasure.
I love how excited he gets about it! Super cool video!
Poor guy uses iPhone. Lmao. Screw metric system
You know what's more stupid than converting metric to imperial or whatever? Caring about what arbitrary measurement system we use enough to actually argue about which is better.
I am 100% certain he said wittle weights.
How many milliwatts has that laser pointer?, thanks.
Years ago I once measured magnetic force within a sample container using a milligram balance by inserting a spatula into the container while a ferrous material was in the container - was a fun discovery (though I couldn't figure out how it was happening at first).
What is NIST,  where does it get its funding, and why is it relevant to society?
This is fun
His nerd energy just radiates everywhere and it's very contagious!!! (In the best way possible!!!)
imperial doesn't sound very freedom
Can this be used to measure the mass of active ingredient in - a homeopathic remedy?
the amount of times he says ish is the most impressive part of this video
in my belief ''everything is in calculation''..  that is a Fact
I'm imagining this guy always has tweezers in his hand. I love it.
For reference: Femto x 10^-15 Pico x 10^-12
7:53 u mean 9.801 ish m/s "squared" right... 😅
0:04 What's up with the Home Alone music?
freedom units lmaooooo
i thought they changed it to be like 10^23 silicon atoms
Just after 14:15 For some reason I heard Derek say 'at the Banana scale' rather than 'at the nano scale' did anyone else hear that or is it just me that measures things with Bananas 🤣
As a test engineer, this looks like my dream job. How do I work at NIST?
Amazing video. Just one question. Is gravity constant on earth?
To call the original kilogram the most precise weight ever is kind of strange. Obviously the kilogram is the most precise one because its weight is defined by itself, so it can never be less then 100% accurate.
Man, video is superb  The guy interviewed is so passionate for his job that thus should be used to motivate students
Forces of such small magnitude as in the thumbnail don’t have a need to be measured.
Dr. Derek Muller can you team up with Dr. Gordon Shaw and make videos for each of the SI units. Not just the seven base units, all of them.
That man's name should be in the video title, he stole the show!
Wow dude you are a great, always amazed of the topics that you talking about huge thx. ❤
Original thumbnail had me reading "piconewtons" as "pinecone tons" lol
Can I just say that I'm not smart to understand much of this, like I have trouble going from a pound to a kilo, but I can appreciate how excited homie is about all of this. It's refreshing to see someone wanting to share their work and have people appreciate it, even if we can't comprehend it.
Love the Guy, he's so excited to show what he's doing!
I love nerds
"freedom units" ...that was good
The power for creating a better future is contained in the present moment, You create a good future by creating a good present.The key to financial freedom and great wealth is a person's ability to convert earned income into passive  income to build generational wealth ,this trick has never failed .
INSANELY FASCINATING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 👍🏼❤️❤️❤️❤️😂🙈. This is fascinating
well damn thanks for the interesting video! love the other guy in the video, so much passion you can see it
I know how atomic force microscopy works and have used it in a lab, but I never appreciated just how ridiculously tiny the cantilevers are
0:49 freedom units lmaooo
Ish
What if there are discrepancies between the electronics in different electromagnetic milligram Planck-unit scales?
I never thought I would watch 15 minutes of video on measurement units and different unit amounts of material but this guy is so passionate about his work!! Love it.
This guy rules. I love people that love what they do and are so willing to share their expertise.
Micro liters are way easier to see than micro grams and they are interchangeable in weight. This just adds to how amazing it is that this micro object was made and accurately measured.
This feels like the joke from Community about The Room Temperature room
Man, this guy loves his job
Now _this_ is content
Dude lose some weight. I love you guy
this guy rocks
who wondered weight was researched so intensively
Wow, what a great interviewee. Dr. Shaw explained things clearly and was so engaged with your questions. And I, now, see that tons of others have made similar comments lol.
10:46 the most relatable moment in the channel’s history.
Speak easy
Anyone wondering what's up with that orange hat?
They’ll tell you we’re metric, but culturally we’re not.
When you measure a piconewton, you're just showing off.
Why isn't the lab featured in this video a clean room?
Imagine hip Santa at a cocktail party, “what do you do? I weigh things. Oh, ok.”
A millionth of a kilogram is a milligram.   Indeed, but I had to think about it for a sec’!
i like this man
Well I feel a iittle more stupid.
The guy said you could generate a force shining a light onto an object, ? Lot of potential with that if true
This is the most NOT boring guy I’ve seen in a very long time 😂
Holy crap!  This is one of the most bonkers videos you've ever done. So cool!!!
This will prove her wrong.
I'm reminded of Adam Savage's video about the obsessiveness of weights and measurements.
AMAZING knew this was possible But What a Cool Job HUH
Yea now i know where to go to weigh my 4-iodo-ohmecarfentanil (100 thousand times stronger than fentanyl which is capable of killing an adult male at a dose of 2mg)
Funny how the "divide by two" idea starts failing at 125grms in the metric system while is perfectly normal and easy thing to do in the "stupid" freedom units.
FREEDOM UNITS 🦅
1:01 NAHHHHHH HAHAHAHA
Huge respect to Gordon for his passion!
Thanks for exploring all of the different work that NIST does. I've worked with them in the past on projects with my work and their facilities are top notch! I'm glad they are getting more public recognition
buah
I toured the facility that made all of those weights. It’s a small, small company in Germany and has one of the original Paris KG pieces now in their little showroom. Pretty cool.
Oh man, this conversation has soooo much "that's what she said" material XDXDXD
Love that guy’s enthusiasm.
There is a valid reason not to use metric here.   Because we don't want to.  And because it's confusing for foreign invaders.  We are not bowing and kowtowing to the leftists and tyrants in other countries, like heck we're willingly going to use their measurement system.  F___ Metric.  F___ the rest of the world.  F___ anyone who doesn't like our version of freedom.
Dr. Shaw reminds me of half the instructors at my school.  I'd kick it with him
I thought this was going to help me with my stroke game
Wait, why didn't you show a laser moving the thing? I thought that was the point...
Freedom unit
I often worry that achievements such as redefining the Kg are a 'Tower of Babel' type achievement.
3,600
This guy is so annoying
Can someone explain unit conversion from presented formulas ???
It's always interesting to see smart nerdy people showing off their stuff. You can see pride and excitement in their eyes and tone. "This is so cool! Thou think it's cool too??" Kinda vibe. And it can be a DnD minis collection or those strange hyper accurate force measurements. This stands in stark contrast to any rich person who is showing off thing garage. I can't really point to what is the difference, but it is always so evident.
The federal government is loaded with people like this—scientists making way less money than they would in industry, doing it because they’re smart and dedicated and passionate about their subject. Dr. Shaw is a metrologist at NIST, but you can find biochemists at NIH or engineers at DARPA or climatologists at NOAA or rocket scientists at JPL—thousands just like him. They’re doing work that wouldn’t be profitable for corporations to do, but it forms the basic science behind everything done by for-profit industry. And all that basic engineering and research is made available to industry at no cost.
Love this Dude!  Enthusiastic, and so glad to explain why.
I feel so enlightened, bless
Piękne rzeczy.
His energy jumps off the screen, you can tell how excited he is to share his knowledge.
This guy is awesome
plancks constant is fake derived from the cmb data which is also fake
That's enough to stretch a DNA molecule..
You can really tell the amount of passion and love he has for his job. It's amazing.
I love how this came out a day before the laser fusion announcement from the US GOVT.
So did they finally find out the reason for replicas diverging in mass?
Would love to have beer with that dude.
Very cool guest. Very fun episode
Which is heavier a kilo of nails or a kilo of cotton?..
I love that guy’s passion and intensity. I want to feel that way about something other than cheese when I’m starving in the middle of the night.
Metric system should only be used with ammunition and drugs
I dont know, but dont you just get excited watching these feats by humans. And the man is excited, so duh.
From the title I thought it was about cosmological constant pressure(dark energy),  I was wrong.
freedom units xD
"I need to get video of this"   "Idk how"   Macro cameras "am I a joke to you?"
Give me that guy's enthusiasm for a month and I'll change this planet...
Reminds me of that movie independence day, where this crazy professor was underground very excited to explain everyone whats was going, Trully amazing!
Very interesting and exciting! Thanks. In the 1960s at a Max Planck Institute we developed machines that measured the torque that a fruit fly develops when turning from left to right in flight. Those are still huge forces by comparison.
"Yes. It's stupid." -Sincerely all Americans. Please can we just switch to metric.
The lad is so passionate about his work, makes it even more fascinating !
That dude was so cool! Must be a blast to work with such people
This guy needs his own youtube channel. Talking about his favourite stuff!
Isn't it like chicken and egg problem? 1. Defining 1 kg mass using planck constant, but it depends on definition of length, time, and energy. 2. He's using that small instrument to measure femtonewton force, how was the device even made as the reference when later it's used to be a reference/standard to calibrate force, what reference did they use when they made the instrument, and so on. If they lied about the number, who would even know,  what other institutions/organizations care to validate things like that?
science is really ahead, its just we don't know
I love this guys enthusiasm
10 micro grams in it's physical form. Holy cow thats super impressive!
Quick question - why use Platinum-Iridium alloy for the kilo weights rather than Gold-197? A stable material with no half-life (not measured anyway), resistant to corrosion, especially if enclosed in such a way as the existing kilo weights - meaning no changes in its weight other than due to difference in gravity at whichever points on Earth?
We need people like Dr. Shaw to talk to our kids. Kids dont hear the words, they feel them. Whatever emotion they are spoken with is what they take away. I would bet the farm that if school kids heard a lecture, or presentation, from him, the amount of kids that would get interested in STEM would triple.
That was very interesting! Great episode!
4.58 so during the time of "production" and calibration of these standard kilogram masses, these masses never have touched? Otherwise with charges in your body you might have wipe some elements off.
I understand that you use a scale to determine differences in weight, but a physical scale has a fulcrum, and that fulcrum is affected by friction. Thats o.k. for heavier objects because you are only trying to determine differences in the mass, but if what you are measuring is  so miniscule, how would it have enough mass to even alter the tilt in the first place? Even a maglev encounters friction, of it could not even work.
Penn and teller voice?!?
Haha.  I use a scale like that at work every day - measures to the 10,000th of a gram.  We use 100, 10, 1 and 0.1 gram calibration weights to test it every morning.  The 0.1 gram weight is just a sliver.
it seems as if he was asked for the first time what he actually does. And he loves his job
This guy doesn't work a day in his life. He loves his profession, the passion has made this his hobby which he gets paid to do.  Awesome video thanks.
So US is metric ? 😱😱😱😱
All these ex college guys acting like they don't know what a gram looks like
Has the absolute inertial reference point been found in which light traverses at the same relative speed (with respect to that point) in absolutely all directions?
I have a feeling YT has many, many more bots than Twitter.
It's just amazing how passionate Dr. Gordon is about his field.
👍    BUT WHERE DID THE MASS OF THE KILOGRAM UNITS GO?!?!? or come from?
Brilliant
Great content and what a great guy and important subject
REALLY enjoyed his commentary. I'm an ME and aggressively pragmatic, so I have a hard time understanding the value for a lot of concepts on the edge of science. That end statement is one of the rare few times that I felt satisfied with the answer for why we could ever need that level of precision. Well done, great video!
TIL Americans actually use the metric system.   Or at least some of them
So if you use big enough light, you can make something light enough to be pushed by the light, at the speed of light. Maybe data or digital picture
Love these videos but some feedback I have to say: there’s something cold and disrespectful about the shots of you holding the camera at eye level at the guy.   Otherwise you’re killing it lately man
This man seems so passionate about his field
Thank you for saving the sponsorship to the end of the video. That's one of my pet peeves about sponsorships and advertisements (i.e. the "annoyance factor", or whether it interrupts something). On that note, I am considering signing up for them, on the grounds that my problem solving skills have not gotten much exercise lately, and I need to fix that. Please continue ensuring that your sponsorships are relevant to your viewers. That's another pet peeve of mine, though it looks like you're doing well enough if I'm finding it relevant. When the advertisement or sponsorship is unintrusive and relevant, like the birds in The Matrix, you're doing it right.
Puts on a hard hat when working with the 10-μg weight.
:D
On the other hand, how to measure the largest force in the universe (insert yo mama joke)
Derek can you do a video on the recent nuclear fusion news
May the force be with you.
Feels like the lab guy has to be the inventor of the "-ish" formulation 😂
Спасибо огромное. Все последние видео безумно интересные. Вы могли бы выпустить увлекательнейшую книгу на основе своих роликов на подобные темы.
5:26 correction: the equation hf=mc^2 does not make any sense, but the units do match. This should be specified.
*points big sausage balloon at you* That's a good question!
Ish!
uk a real one for giving us the k series, DOHC VTEC freedom units baby
Being able to work in both systems is a form of bilingual skill just in mathematics.  Some can only think and work in one language.
"Freedom units"!!! Freedom from common sense, apparently. All US scientists use SI units, because imperial units are so backward.
Nerdy Russel Crowe is dope.
5:00 MASS STANDARDS WITH CHANGING MASSES - originally equal kilogram standards are diverging and getting heavier. Indicating one particular original Gravity Theory.
Displaying those dead insects behind you make you a bit of a psychopath.
This made me realise that like lasers, even words have a weight, even thoughts have weight (since they are all just molecules vibrating in a certain way). we take so much for granted simply because we have access to them
Imagine all that resources for debunking the "pandemic"
@Vertasium made of video on Harmonic motions,seems an interesting topic though.
These last few video's about NIST are amazing. Full of genuinely passionate and knowledgable people just dying to educate.
Luke.. Use the force..
Veritasium pleeeease do an episode on the new fusion discovery!
I love this guy
I recently helped out my SO with weight mesurements on leaves for her doctorate, the scale was so precise that you could see the loss of weight from water evaporating or addition from drafts when someone opened the door to the laboratory. Science is lit my dudes. 8)
Bow down to your hard work and passion. Lots of love from India.  Jayasurya, Save Soil
As a facility that deals with extremely accurate measurement, I would expect them to be more strict with the hygiene standard (face mask, sterile clothing, etc) especially when it involves forces.  Wouldn't the casual clothing and the particulate from their mouth when they speak risk a contamination on the standards that they uses there? I mean I imagine even a slight exposure to contaminant would jeopardize the accuracy of these objects.
Can I ask the big question? What's with the orange balloon? :D
anyone planning to use for coffee ?
world's fanciest weed scale
Please measure the mass attraction force between 2 billiard balls, 1mm, 1cm, 1m apart.
Metres, kilos, Celsius... So that place is basically an oasis of sanity in an ocean of madness! 😅
00:59 MY MAN! Shout out to all the engineers out there!!!
I love how hyped he describes it ❤ loved it
Imagine trying to measure femtonewtons when a *bacterium (single bacteria)* exerts orders of magnatude more force.
so we're just going to skip over the part where the "standard kiliograms" spontaneously gained mass?
Really liked the passion and energy he possessed while explaining stuff. Great Educator!
0:48 - USA here is a tip for you - just stop calculating everything from foots to meters and meters to foots - just use metric system
I'm surprised a contamination suit isn't required for that lab. The particles from your breath could throw off a measurement. He didn't want Derek touching the reference mass with his fingers because of fingerprints, but then he let him breathe all over them lol.
what a lovely relaxed, yet lively episode
Dr. Shaw needs his own YT channel, measuring stuff with the EFB, or just talking about chemistry.
The science of measurement is the basis of everything. I loved learning that weight is defined in terms of Planck's constant. ( the speed of light is defined in terms of a wavelength)
This just crazy!!
Well then. How many gram is instragram?
Veritasium: “US is secretly metric”  Me: Laughing in European
i love this guy so much, and i’m happy that’s a seemingly shared sentiment. truly one of the best of us
Absolutley captivating. We are seeing science and theoretical physics principles from 20 years ago being implemented in an engineering capacity to further improve our ability to become precice, accurate and push science and engineering further. Positive reinforcement loop... fkyeah.
Wow
Walter whites guy
This guy would be a perfect teacher for anything science related. He's so passionate. You could see his joy for what he does.
@veritasium Idea for a short: What are the physics behind the crokinole follow through?? I’m no physics guru, but it seems that it breaks the rules! It’s not like a billiard follow through because you can’t spin the thing you’re following through! If this makes no sense, look up the crokinole follow through 20 because I don’t get it.
Who cleans the inside of that vacuum scale vessel to make sure there are no loose particles flying around inside from a worker's clothing or skin flakes or, ahem, whiskers from a beard, etc., and how is the cleaning done? You would think everything would be done in a clean room just to make sure the odd speck doesn't throw things off. Is there a qualified maid or janitor who comes by after hours in a bunny suit with a box of Kimwipes and bottle of extra special Windex (and later documents it all on lint-free forms stored in a glass filing cabinet cleaned every night by another qualified crew)?  Perhaps you can do an episode on life in the super clean world.
Why are you talking over the accurate little masses?  Little saliva droplets are falling...
Great vid, and loved so much the guy, the type of guy who just makes any situation more fun / chill / interesting, and he knows physics and his craft in depth full on?? A perfect beer buddy
In the video 11.37-11.42 it is explained that the measurement of the small Newton force uses laser light as a push? How to make the laser light a push Newton?
Humans are Magnificent!
I was going to say that all of this assumes gravity is constant ignoring the liquidity of the Earth's core. But that thing at the end , if I understand it , is so genius let's say I was wrong
I don’t really get the diving board thing he kinda skipped over it
Have not seen this video.... This is not the tiniest force in universe.....
🤯
5:08 best definition of Planck's constant.
this was very interesting
I'm still gonna beat you to unity, Derek. Ur not even close, hombre....,
His voice is a convincing impression of Penn Jilette.
12:18 wait...did we miss something fun with a balloon?
Ok. Both of those man love there jobs.
I love this guy. So passionate and a great explainer.
I share the NIST employee's enthusiasm for what he is doing and working with!
NIST would be a very cool place to visit and work at !
0:40 wrong map of india, plz correct it in future 🙏 Jammu and kashmir(including POK) and ladakh(including akshai chin) is integral part of India
But I read from an unlikely source that Planks constant changes ever so slightly as the universe expands, and thus the speed of light and a mass "constant".  Food for thought.
NICE  AWES0ME KEEP_IT_UP! Western digital✨🎉✨🎉✨🎉🎉🎎🎭🎎🎭🎎🎭🎗🎗🎗🎗🎗🎗🎗🎑🎑🎑🎑🎑🎑🎑✨🎆🎆
What an amazingly interesting video. Thanks
Do people who need a microgram-level measurements have to go to this guy to get it done, or do they have their own versions of that balance?
That guy was really nerding out! lol. I took a metrology course in college but it definitely wasn't anywhere near this level of measurement!
I love this video mostly for the great and cool energy of the guy in the red shirt. 😁
reinhart if he stayed with winston
Gordon is *PUMPED* that he can share what he does!
That lab is so cool. I love how much that guy knows and wants to share!
This man is so passionate it actually makes you care about the smallest measurements capable. It's incredible.
I swear to God interferometry is everywhere
Upvote for a Dr. Shaw Youtube channel
That femtonewton of force is small, but when you add enough of them together you get enough force to hold up a star against its own gravity.
This is the kinda scientist we need to increase funding for, great video.
Well I can’t access this because the country im from is just a mess! Learning is now gold..
How passionate is this man about his job! I've never seen anyone such passionate for his work.
My man is a real life Jedi
I'd like to see this guy's strategy to carving up the Thanksgiving Day turkey so that everyone gets the same amount!  Truly, the work he is doing is the basis of all science.  This is the root of Inductive reasoning.
How do they even cut the materials to be so small? Must be some really tiny scissors.
He’s great. So passionate about what he does.
great to see how this guy loves what hes doing
Great way to weigh some LSD dosages
im really loving these recent videos on the science of precision, incredibly fascinating
A few years ago, I used to watch this channel and find everything brand new and unknown. A few years later it is the same stuff I’ve been learning in school.
When he says “I use a capacitor …” or  “I apply a voltage …” is he saying he invented this machine? If Yes, hats off brother, if not it’s strange wording.
with the certainty of “-ish” this lab records the most accurate measurements in the world
He loves his job, that's for sure.
This man truly loves what he does, you love to see it
We use tiny people like putin...
Basically the gravitational force of energy
Always amazing to see someone so dedicated to this type of subjects. I really liked this video =)
Why does he need a hard hat? Is it a fashion statement?
Did they have to call this guy over to measure the surplus energy they generated by fusion?
I agree, it's stupid for us to use the metric system in our everyday lives. Science is another matter.
I agree we should use metric. I also kind if hate when people call them freedom units. As if to forget why at one point most of the world used them. They are imperial units that were put in place by the British empire...
I had a physics professor like Gordon once and it was an amazing class! I love seeing people this excited about what they do and explaining it to others
Please do another video with Dr. Shaw!
This was a brilliant episode! Thank you!
I love this guy's enthusiasm and his ability to present his very specific knowledge in a way that's understandable and natural
We weigh 0.04 gram of cocaine ffs
🤩
Veristasium is like Kurzgesagt but with a human host. Love this!
I wonder what happened in 1950 that caused some of the weight standards to deviate faster?
11:55 Can this be used to better understand and model the Yarkovsky effect?
12:50 BAD EYE PROTECTION
This guy is full of life and clearly loves what he's doing. Awesome for him!
The SI card, pretty much everything is derived from time.
America has lost to the metric system Even gun cannot stop superior measurement
This is amazing
That's pretty cool!
So how many laser pointers do you need to make a kugelblitz in your basement?
12:09 - and that, boys and girls, is why you never ever point a laser pointer into your eyes.
A laser is strong enough to stretch out your DNA. Hello cancer.
That 10ug looked like another crack on my phone
Gordon needs his own show.
I would love to know how this compares to the world's smallest violin, which is the least possible amount of empathy someone can have for the misfortune someone else brought on themselves.
"Freedom" units.  LMAO
I have always been crazy about precision. I worked for IBM in the 70's and I would make adjustments down to +/- 0.5 nS +/- 10 micro inches. The 7 nm technology is so far beyond anything I have ever put my hands on, it is hard for me to imagine.
Bruh..... what if it was $10 a micro gram for smoke??? LoL things would get cra cra.
Dude, i would never know how interesting measuring weight is if not for this video, it sounds so boring but is actually very cool and very damn interesting
Old dudes that cling on to having long hair aren’t doing themselves any favors.
This really takes me back to one of the first videos I saw on your channel, the perfect sphere. The nostalgia
Please do a video on gpt3
My wife keeps asking me if this femto unit makes her look fat. I tell her to pico ass up and get to the gym.
I want a scale that goes down to the 100 nanograms like the one he has
That man's level of excitement about his field is contagious!
Makes u think if u can measure the force of a Lazer pointer. Just got me thinking there's probably a good force coming though your phone everyday.
He needs a raise.
Government conspiracy make people think they are using imperial units when they are using the metric system.😂
We tend to forget that advanced industries need advanced metrology and standartization. It's amazing how humans were able to achieve this level of complexity.
I love how passionate and knowledgeable Derek is about this. Explained so well too. You’re a credit to yourself and science sir.
For those wondering how we would calculate the force of a laser in theory, you just take the power of the laser and divide by the speed of light. For example a typical laser pointer might have a power of 1 to 5 milliwatts, which you divide by 3*10^8 m/s to get, indeed, a force in the piconewton range.
So tune a light beam to excite Cesium, measure its energy, convert that energy to mass, and multiply that mass by 156029346439284541350077670775371 1706058165632351/2351088797303619, and you've got a kilogram.
My head hurts!!! 😅
Freedom units where one of the major political parties, wanted to commit treason and ignore an legit election result.
This guy makes this so interesting. Normally I have to fast forward, or skip ahead in videos, since I get bored with my ADHD, but Gordon is so good at explaining these things.
Y’all really out here hunting down the Holy Spirit
Great interview. This gent is no lightweight!
I felt derek was lucky to tour the facility in person - and myself for having derek creating a video about that facility. I will never experience that tour with where i am now.
first
I got an endorphin rush just listening to this guy. He's so genuine and so passionate about what he's doing... I wish I felt this way about my sales job.
What a great interview. The guy has a nack of making the complex simple to understand, A++
If you can measure the force of a laser pointer, does that imply the possibility of measuring the force transmitted by a single photon by measuring the force that might be transmitted by a much larger number of photons? Is there any possibility of setting up an experiment that will detect the mass of photons, if such mass exists?
It's always a joy to watch someone explain their cool work that they also love to do.
i'm such a whore for metrology
I want a Kibble balance so I can accurately measure er.. some things I have at home.
It's about time they got their heads out of their asses and figure it out that you wouldn't be able to measure things or weigh things the way they were doing you can only use energy because that's what everything is made up of, idiots
What
Is that how you say it?
I’m sorry, wha I meant was, “What about weighing a yoctogram?”
Last time I used weighs was for calibrating ground support air speed and altitude sensors test unit, using weights in a vacuum
What about weighing a yoctometer?
I could watch an entire series with this man. He's so passionate, engaging and welcoming. I hope he reads all of the wonderful comments on this video and sees how much people appreciate the work he does and how he communicates it with us all. Thanks Dr. Shaw!
This guy brings to mind a Boris Johnson in a world where he didn't bother with creating a weird persona. What similarities am I picking up on here?
Is it stupid to use a base 12 system? It has much easier fractional math. Base 2 is useful for logic. Base 16 is great for bytes.  Is it really that hard to understand that there are pros and cons to each? Come on people.
3:53 Oh the 5-sided mass is 500mg so the 4 sided next to it msust be 400mg I see xD
This is nuts, my jaw literally dropped when he said he could measure the force of a laser pointer.
7:48 assuming that machinery in fact measured g (gravitational acceleration), 9.81 m/s^2*
Can you please make a video on precision electric field measurement?
It's not just the Kg standard that makes us metric.  Many STEM fields are metric.  If you want to be a chemist, plan on using the metric system your whole career.  It is a better system hands down...it's a shame we don't convert all the way.
7 femtonewtons: coincidentally, also the force required to make a pro soccer player fall over.
This man is very passionate about his work and it shows. Thank Dr Gordon Show and Derek Muller for that visit!
I love to see people who are enthusiastic about their work. We should all be so lucky as to have a career we are passionate about.
To seek out new weights and new newtons.  To boldly go where no one has measured before!   Dr Shaw -- Make it so
This guy is great! How accurately do they measure the voltage and properties of the capacitor?
Ahh yes clickbaited again
i wanna go there and just play around for a few months 🤩
this guy is so cool.
I love this type of content, keep it up
Pretty sure that's hazel from umbrella academy
Very interesting! Dr. Shaw's passion made me want to work in NIST myself
Dusty: Umm..what's Planck's Constant again? I forgot. 😅  Susie: 🤬
It definitely is stupid. So let’s stop pretending we use the metric system. 😘
Biggest plot twist in humankind; Imperial system is derived from the metric system
Somebody give Dr. Gordon Shaw a healthy raise! It's easy to tell he loves what he does, and loves communicating it to people who are interested!
Awesome🎉 👏
We are an insane species, man.
12:30 "in Diesel systems particulate contamination is really kind of a big deal" Understatement of the century :)

Alternative Title: Veritasium getting some gains [FOUND FOOTAGE]
This guy is the goat
It's really great to see someone really loving what they do.
if there only 20 of these than is there only 20 countries on the metric system? If countries can share than why did they make more than one?
You people can keep your metric system, thanks. We're good.
I can accurately say that Dr Shaw likes his job a lot. Fantastic guy.
Wow how cool is this
anybody else think he sounds like cave jhonson when he says "science"
What does a person need to go  60-70 years old and keep that level of passion about what you do? What an awesome human being.
This guy is the best. So articulate and passionate. I learned a lot from this.
Great work
Wasn't kg originally defined by the pound?
America should measure the weight of 7k pieces of grain and create a standard weight based off of that. Then send the kilogram back to Fr*nce from where it came.
you can always tell when people love their jobs and this guy surely does, awesome stuff
It's infectious how excited he is about his craft.  I want to go measure things with lasers now
Man makes physics captivating.
I was always so into the idea of the kilogram. How it's a concept AND a physical object! And I'm so happy you're continuing this, long after they redid the kilogram ❤
freedom units or for short f u
It's under the chair.
who is gonna get more people to use brilliant ? kuzgesagt or veritassirum
That was outstanding Derek, what enthusiasm and knowledge and passion from the Doc.  All I could think about though was how long it would take him to mix 50g of butter with 100g of flour - we'd all be starving!
Bueno si leo los subtítulos pierdo las imágenes y además están los tecnicismos por favor pongan al traductor, que además transmite la personalidad de Derek muy bien gracias y adiós 👋👋👋
Can you make more of the history-science videos like you did with dr. fritz haber's story
Check out the SFA (Surface force apparatus) if you wanna see what this looks on steriods!
You will never convert me to metric system.
I didn't know I could get so much interested in mesurations!
He seems like such a cool guy i'd wanna be friends with him
There's nothing quite like watching a knowledge person explaining the thing they're knowledgeable about in an enthusiastic manner. It's the kind of thing that gets you to actually *learn and remember* things, and maybe look into them more because now *you* are curious.
For someone working with super accurate measurements using scales like nano newton or pico newton he uses the word "ish" a lot 😂
That guy seem to be very generous and full of enthusasium to tell world about what he does and how it works
Dr Shaw was awesome
A gorilla would be able to figure this one out. Gorillas are gentle and intelligent. You should have a gorilla on.
1:00 he said it, not me
Please: More more more more.......
In terms of precision measurement, how close are we to accurate determination of whether a distance object in space will hit the Earth or not?
When you weigh out recomended serving sizes on the food label.
“Freedom units” 😂
Who made the first kilo then
Who made the first kilo lol
10:05
Why not measure the density of some material and then create your arbitrarily small weight by volume? 🤔
There was a massive bar at the Smithsonian set with gauges that let people see bend deflection when you touched it
i saw the 10 micrograms
thank you Dr Shaw and Derek for the wonderful explanation and video
Great video. Really cool to see small measurements I use theoretically in real life. Thanks
man shocked I was called to be on...
More with Dr Shaw please, he's just awesome!
Its great, absolutely fantastic stuff, but will it make my bills less, will it improve my life or anyone's  ?
I don’t know why I love this guy so much  but what I do know is that I love him.
🔬
The chances of me finding my nerf darts can’t be seen by anything in the universe
0:55 that'll upset a lot of ppl
Dr. Shaw's explaination and his evident joy in what he does.  Coupled with Derek's ability to ask just the right questions.   That's what makes this a great channel.
12:18 love it when this music starts. It’s like, here’s the science!
How can a laser to have force?
I love the guy's enthusiasm!
Dude is cool as hell great speaker wish he would do a  Ted talk or something like that.
Not being rude but the way this guy said, "Ahhh yesss" really sounded like Seth Rogan to me 9:16
20 degrees Celsius eh? What country are you making these videos for anyway?
Title needs to be fixed.  It's "How To Measure The Tiniest Forces"  Not "In The Universe"
The sheer passion this scientist puts into his job and the explaining and how excited he gets with every question is astounding! Loved this episode!
My man was talking about the forces needed to stretch human dna and then talked about measuring forces way smaller than that. The to me is more mind boggling than the expanse of the known universe. Science is so rad.
It is so cool seeing someone so passionate and excited about their job. That was neat.
This is all very sciency and all, but I'm just constantly wondering what happens if one (1) person sneezes on the weights or while looking inside the golden balance machine...
His energy is contagious. I really enjoyed this one.
12:18 nobody is going to ask why Derek is threatened by a big sausage?
It can measure the force of a laser, and be flexed by hand like that lol, cool 😎
I love this guy's way of communicating his knowledge and his enthusiasm!! One of my favourites!
I LOVE how much this man loves his job. The fact that he thinks this stuff is insanely cool (which it is!) Is just awesome
US is secretly metric 😂😂
9:04 ooooh special lens!
I love how animated and excited he was. I love seeing super smart people showing how passionate they are about their work.
Quick question. When handling these small masses by hand, do the people handling the masses need to wear face masks. I would assume that they wouldn't want any accidental moisture on these extremely fine tuned weights?
I love the passion this guy has
Before I watch this, I’ve always had a question… Does light weigh anything? Say if you shone a torch on some weighing scales
Wait! I want to know what's the deal with the orange balloon.
I've always found it amazing how the different fields of technology (and science in general) feed into each other. As an aspiring game dev I often think about the progress of science, and moreover what would be needed to build something like a computer from the ground up if you had all the knowledge but none of the tools. You can't just find some silica and copper, melt it and make a chip. There's tools to be created first, which allows for better and more precise technology, which allows for better tools again, and this goes back and forth a lot. Seeing this video really puts all of that into perspective. Not only as to how much work that goes into it, but especially the co-operation of both the different fields of technologies, and the effort and knowledge of so many people as well.
The best thing about this video, arguably and aside from the actual knowledge, was the passion shown by Dr. Shaw, because of that his word carries a lot of weight!   LOL
Dr. Shaw is my hero
That force from your screen must have some effect on the universes
It really looks like this lab is run entirely by this one guy the way it's presented but I can only imagine the amount of other experts and support that is needed to do such precise work
5:18 i don't know why but wiggly worm photon made me die laughing
1:55 Scientist Jon Favreau
I like how Derek uses a ballon the empasize his gesture at 12:16
Very interesting video; I loved how Gordon was so excited all the way through.
Is there risk of circular reasoning happening? You measure the voltage change to measure the mass, but how do you know your voltage meter is accurate enough for the task?
i love how enthusiastic the guy is, you can see he loves it :)
The Austrians are developing the thinnest wire in the world. When it was finished, they wanted to know its diameter. But since the wire is so thin, they can't measure it.  One of the Austrians said, "Let's send it to Germany. They are highly technologized. I'm sure they can measure it."  Says the other, "No, we won't take that chance. Let's send him to America instead. They are also highly developed."  So they put the wire in a box and enclose a note asking them to measure the diameter of the wire. After 2 weeks, the box comes back. A reply note says, "Unfortunately, we can't measure the diameter of the wire. Too thin."  On it the one Austrian says again: "Then we must send it to Germany."  Says the other, "No, we'd rather send it to China. Microchips are being built there. They can certainly measure it."  No sooner said than done. They enclose a note again, with the request to measure the diameter of the wire. After 2 weeks the box is back. The reply says, "Unfortunately, we can't measure this wire. Too thin."  Says the one Austrian: "Now, unfortunately, only Germany remains for us."  Says the other, "All right. Then we'll just send it to Germany."  So the wire is packed into a box again and sent to Germany. But this time the Austrians forget to enclose a note telling them what they actually want.  It takes 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks ... no box. Only after 6 weeks the box comes again. And there is a note enclosed:  "We didn't know what to do with this wire. First we cut a thread on it and drilled a hole through it lengthwise. We hope that was in your sense!"
cant touch it due to fingerprints but can have long hair and beard no hairnet seems counterproductive
7:25 mans closing the door without closing the door 😂
What about the influence of local earth densities? the same kilogram would weigh differently depending on this local variable.
That ability to convey scale is brilliant. These are the kind of people that made science such fun at school. I think i was lucky that i had teacher that all loved there subject. They were a great time, all convinced there subject was the best and most important (physic, chemistry or biology) but all taught with passion. None of them seemed focused on telling you what to learn, they all just wanted to show you why you would want to learn.
Derek you're amazing for bringing us these videos!
Love this guy. So passionate about his work
Impressive how much passion this guy has on weighing things. I envy him.
I have never said this incredibly corny thing, but the time just spent watching Dr. Shaw has buoyed my soul. Imagine working with such amazing people every day. NIST must be an incredible place.
at 4:40 when shown a map while saying "in paris" i though to myself "this is not Paris !" I realized it's actualy the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) in Saint Cloud just outside Paris that's in the center of the map.
Wow, this guy was just incredible! So enthusiastic and really good at explaining!
"How To Measure The Tiniest Forces In The Universe" finally there is a way to measure how much women are attracted to me
I want to go in here and swallow all of the little metal wights.
Change the thumbnail like 3 times now as I'm writing this!
Gordon is such a nerd.  My hero!
As he said in the video, it's stupid US uses metric units but internally converts to its imperial units, which is stupid. And imperial is difficult to keep track of.
"we measure the smallest forces in the world with precision that is absolute-ish."
I just love this guy. He's like a scientific Santa: know everything and is jolly and fun!
Right. America is stupid.
Derek must be so happy to find such a passionate and talkative scientist. The previous video about the waves were from crunched up military and engineer people, who are not the most talkative generally hahaa
Wait wasn't light mass-less? How can light generate a force if it doesn't have mass?
What an INTERESTING guy! Great episode!
humanity's greatest discovery is measurement...
...................................MASSIVE & DEEP = NERD's ....😁😁!!
His voice sounds like Boris Johnson´s
This is so fascinating!
Must be viewed by a drug dealer.
Technically, the force being measured here is the matter that is inside each photon being shot out of the laser. Proving yet again, in a long history of such proofs, that "energy" is just excited matter, in this case an electron attached to a dipole attached to an anti-electron without a nucleus aka a positron. Because there is matter in photons, the father away each galaxy is from Earth, the slower its photons travel as they sail through the Einstein-Bose Condensate that exists all through space. This makes the most distant galaxies seem to travel away from us faster and faster, creating the illusion of Doppler Red Shift.
There is something special about people at the bleeding edge of their field just talking about it with this sort of passion. This guy loves what he does and you feel it every minute
i love how passionate he is about it. i wasnt that interrested by the sound of the title but as soon as he started talking i was fascinated . another great video
It’s incredible the level of accuracy we’re now capable of measuring compared to the past.  It’s all thanks to metrology.  Thanks for continually bringing us the best content out there, Derek; it’s greatly appreciated.
How can a laser create thrust with photons that have no mass?
Ish
When I was a kid everything felt so magical, now I am 18 and I am just finally starting to understand how the world works. There is no weight or time, things just simply are. However for modern humans to operate effectively we require To be in harmony, by weight or by time.
This video was great, Dr. Shaw was greater. What enthusiasm and clarity of description!
What a lovely guy!
I just love how often he says "...ish". Like, he measures with increadible accuracy as a living, the irony is just great! Really engaging person!
This guy is called Dr. Gordon and he looks like Gabe Newell. Thats so cool.
Imagine breathing it in accidentally 9:27
I love how passionate Dr Shaw is at his job. God I wish to work in something I am this passionate about AND get paid for it.
My dealer has been under weighing me for years! I now know why, the uncertainty. I thought i was being ripped off, thanks guys :)
I envy this Dr Gordon's kids/nephews. Coolest dad/uncle.
Awesome! Dr. Shaw would be a perfect fit for an episode of @WIRED tech support
I love the enthusiasm, but even more the ability to explain very complex concepts in a relatable way. Fantastic video, credit to Dr Shaw for being such a fantastic presenter!
Ask Devin if you can tell, about his dad's metrology work on JWST and other projects
This gotta be the cooles science uncle I've ever seen.
"Freedom units"
the funniest thing i'll remember from this video is : US use metric system!!! We won!! (i'm french) femto-newtons!! amazing because i don't even know what "femto" means (one billionth of billionth???)
🤯
Dr. Gordon is a freaky of measurement. I bet he comes out with rulers and scales in his pocket.
That is insane and awesome!!!!!
Dr. Shaw was really fun in this video. As excited about science as you and Destin.
I can’t measure it, but that didn’t feel like 15mins. Superbly interesting.
Freedom units are handy for stuff like carpentry and building. Very easy to divide by 2. Other than that, yep, super dumb.
love the passion
i like it when people are passionate about their area of expertise
Dr Shaw is an absolute legend!
I don't like you
I might need a test mass… for non- criminal purposes of course
An experienced weed seller would be able to tell you what is a gram with just their hand/ palm.  And they’ll be correct down to the .001
7:57 m/s^2 *
9:11 holy crap that lens
Genuine question.  Why does American use metric system
I dreamt this 5 days ago
@vertasium can you do a video on the nuclear fusion breakthrough?
Guys, just go metric...  (At a cost of like >$1,000,000,000,000 to your economy)
To chide American's don't embrace the metric system is short sighted.  The metric system is not flawless either.  Celsius fails when you consider a human can't take much of a temperature change which makes the measurement less valuable.  Then try to create a third out of 10.   Yeah the extended decimal is dumb.  10 doesn't divide as well as 12.
Gordan Freeman Explaining Resonance Cascade
cool
For someone who deals with the most accurate measurements ever devised by humankind, he certainly likes to use the suffix "ish" a lot.
Não entendi nada 😂
This guy is so awesome please do more with him
Okay, but tens of micrograms of error is actually really bad in some industries (f.e.: medicine).
I would change the title to how to measure the tiniest force known to Humans
He kind of sounds like boris Johnson to me- except intelligent. It’s his crazy passion
This guy sounds like a cross between Seth Rogen and Steve the MRE guy
Hey! Its Average bro
It's always great to listen to people who are excited about what they do!  Great video.
You got iphone wooww
Truly one of the most captivating videos I’ve ever seen on this channel
One question, Derek, (with apologies if somebody else has already asked this and had it answered) that I feel confident you can answer. Since (I won't say "if") photons are massless, how can they transmit force? I found out over 50 years ago that photons can transmit force (something called a " light sail") and I know they have no mass but how then can they transmit force?
Dr. Shaw is so passionate about his work, I love it. This was so cool.
@9:20  This gives the term 'splitting hairs' a totally new meaning.
Amazing presentation from the researcher. Thank you for having us in your lab!
9.801 meters per second square*
5:42 is the hf/c^2 a unit? A bit confused about the form of that equation (shouldn't it be m=hf/c^2?)
That ten-microgram weight looks like the contender for "World's most expensive sneeze".
Laowa 24mm f/14 Probe
@ 0:28 Isn't the most precise/confident unit of measurement we have the second? By a massive margin?
great great video and that guy was so good on camera
So photons that have no mass traveling at the speed of light can actually exert a force?  I thought being massless meant zero force ever.
you changed the thumbnail..!
Not to detract from the fascinating subject and the clear explanations, but does anyone else feel that Dr. Gordon Shaw has some Boris-Johnson-esque mannerisms?
Dr. Shaw was really excited to show and talk about his work. Despite his age he seems to have never lost the excitement to be working in that field. That's a good thing in my book.
I've been curious about the redefining of the kilogram since you posted the near perfect sphere video
love this channel
8:40 Don't sneeze!
“Freedom units” is the best thing I think I’ve ever heard
So @2:06, does the machine display the weight or the mass of the specimen??? If it's the mass, does the machine calculate the weight and then divide it by g before displaying??? I'm uncertain this has been addressed properly.
How can you measure the force of the photons from a laser pointer when the photons does not have any mass?
I love this guy!
Imagine the holiday party conversation this guy has when some nerd unassumingly asks him what he does for a living.
0:46 ladies and gentlemen, we got em
Great video!
Amazing 👏🏻
You made that?!  Ahh yes, with great trouble.
Dr. Shaw sounds like a younger version of Agent ULP (Jeff Steitzer) from GTA Online. 👀
12:19 why was he holding a balloon? I want to see that clip!
Awesome video, But Freedom Units? How backward!
he looks like a kid showing off his toys to interested parties... very eager, i love it :D
Every atom and atomic objects are expanding at 1/770,000th their size per second per second constant acceleration. Applied to earth size object equals 16 feet per second per second constant acceleration: gravity. D=1/2at^2 major part of the gravity equation. “The Final Theory: Rethinking Our Scientific Legacy “, Mark McCutcheon. How long will ignorance prevail. Light is a cluster of expanding electrons. Sending white light through a prism divides the light by ‘size’, I.e. the red ( most ‘massive ‘) bends least. Planck’s ‘ constant is simply a single expanding electron: an object,not a wave, field, potential, etc ( all the usual suspects).
The passion that Gordon has for his work is inspiring. Great video
Gordon is probably an amazing DM
What’s a point? Science still can’t science the simple word Point.
The irony of this guy wearing a helmet in a lab that measure extremely low weights
Man, that guy is a NERD and I'm all here for it!
I'm not sold on the theory of photons having push force- in this example I find it much more likely the heat from the laser is what causes the vibration tool to react.
I love this guy
Hiii, can u do a video about the millennium problems? <33
That guy's wife knows all about measuring too...not necessarily by choice. 🤭
Too many ads
A laser pointer can put pressure 🤯
I like Dr. Gordon Shaw's presentation en enthusiasm. Well done.
No disrespect cause I like him a lot, but the guy totally reminds me of the alien scientist from independence day
Coming from a semiconductor engineer. wouldnt it be better to wear face masks and bunny suits, to keep all the body stuff away from those hyper sensitive stuff?
No, the US isn't "on" the metric system, it's that most of the world uses metric and it's easier to go by what everyone else uses when talking to everyone else. If you wanna be 'that guy' and give the person in Britain or wherever an unneeded hard time by using your own measurements then go ahead but just know it's a dick move.
Thumbs up for the admission of freedom units being stupid  😅
Find a job you like as much as Gordon likes his.
I love the background music which is in all of his videos
Freedom is confusing
*Pico Newtons:* The infinitesimal weight many politicians feel on their conscience after they knowingly lie or break their promises.

stärkten die Seelen der Jünger und ermahnten sie, daß sie im Glauben blieben, und daß wir durch viel Trübsale müssen in das Reich Gottes gehen. (Acts 14:22) - Es ist das letzte Mal. Der Herr kommt bald. Glauben Sie an Jesus Christus, bereuen Sie und werden Sie gerettet.
Awesome explanations!
It's so cool to see someone like Dr. Gordon Shaw being so obviously enthusiastic about their job!
That is one wholesome dood who loves what he’s doing! Good stuff.
One millionth of a kilogram is a microgram not a milligram.
NIST IS SO COOL 😎
So much money time space effort and importance put into BS!
The fact that he called them "freedom units" is awesome
Welcome to Dr Shaw's new video, today with Derek the camera guy.  Seriously, he did a fantastic job explaining and showed nothing but pure passion for what he is doing. I really hope we will see him again.
Cool guy
this mans giving me independence day vibes.
I came across microcantilievers while doing my PhD bibilographic research on some pesticides traces sensing. Those are fabulous. You can also "cover" one side of the arm with specific molecules designed to react with the chemical that you want to sense. It then becomes sensitive to the desired molecule. Then the cavity below the arm (as shown in the big model in the video) is filled with the gas or the solution that you want to test. The sensitive arm then reacts with the analyte and that creates a bending force that is measured (like if you measured the bending force of a weight put onto the lever).  Despite being very hard to calibrate, this system can be 10^10 times more sensitive than the best sensing technologies ! So this technology was able to detect as low as 10000 molecules in one mL, which is nothing (there is 10^21 water molecules in one mL of water)! Its humongous sensitvity is also a huge drawback, so that you can't really take it out of the very controlled lab conditions. But the sensitivity of that thing is just breathtaking.
Precision Planck's ziptie 6:06
I'm curious about the design of the standard kilogram. Shouldn't it be a sphere or as close to a sphere, so that it's mass to surface area is the highest? It seems like a good idea to make the surface area as small as possible to reduce surface contamination.
The star of the show here is Dr. Gordon Shaw for drawing us in to share the enthusiasm that he has for what I thought was a boring topic like metrology.  Excellent work Dr. Shaw.
That’s coooooooooooool
Nano newton and Pico newton wow this is interesting.
I'm pretty sure that force is average
"Yes, it’s stupid" Most based american in history
This man makes me anxiously excited to hear him share knowledge, I really want to know more.
dear veritasium map shown of india is incorrect pls correct it
dat iz crazzy
I think at the end he missed a point (or not clearly said) where measuring tools defines how precise working tools we can create and with small working tools we can make more precise things (micro robots, CPUs...)
As someone who's worked at NIST before you tend to find many brilliant people like Dr. Shaw all over the campus.
Dr Shaw great guy !
Most people probably take for granted how simple it is for us to weigh things, so I’m really glad to see this featured. It’s so important, and without people like Dr. Shaw nothing we weigh would be consistent. It’s awesome to see how passionate he is about what he does, and he clearly takes great pride in it. Great video all around!
Screw you   John Butliski    Homophobic wanna be
It confuses me how usa uses si units and converts them into empirical units, to use them commercially and in industries....
Totally awesome video, the excitement of both you and him really made it come to life
This man is brilliant, like I'm sitting here smiling at how excited he is about his work :D
Gordon's energy is amazing :D  One of the best guests on the show ever!
he seems like a really cool guy
Could you measure the energy used to move a card in Microsoft solitaire?
Bro, this guy is so cool. To be able to explain such complicated stuff at a level a normal person can understand what’s going on… what a legend.
NIST is one of the few government organizations I respect. I am a security analyst and work a lot with NIST compliance. The way they build their standards is purely quantifiable but most importanlty scalable. Bravo, this was awesome.
One of the most interesting, to say at least, youtube channels. Thank you!
share your food with your sibling using the kilo balance
At 4 minutes he was wrong when he said subdividing it a million times to get a mg! You subdivide a kg a 1000 times to get a mg Mr Expert.
I thought gravity was an illusion
Ish
You can tell that Gordon doesn't go to work, he just sits in a lab and has fun all day.
Fascinating stuff! Now only if NIST made a kitchen scale, it would probably work, unlike the Chinese one I'm stuck with.
Dr. Gordon Shaw has a peculiar way of communicating - he looks like a Boris Johnson's lost twin.
I love how excited this guy is about what he is talking about! ❤
Freedom units!
Funny....you use the imperial system to divide the kilogram......    oh the irony
what camera is derek using?!
Derek....so much of this info u did address in another much older video ryt🙄
Why does it feel like I've already seen this video???
If only we have a fraction of people like Dr Shaw in this world, it would be a whole lot better
I absolutely love this man's passion and excitement while explaining everything. This is what keeps me studying chemistry, because after a while it's very easy to lose that excitement. Keep it up man!
@Smarter Every Day - I hope Destin sees this video. I kept thinking about him and his dad the whole time, and thought they'd appreciate a light being shone on the metrology field.
That was amazing thank you Dr. Shaw for all of your hard work and many thanks to the NIST teams for furthering science! you guys are awesome!!
Fantastic video, I looove Dr Shaw and his excitement, and helped me really understand what he was trying to say, and what he was so excited about. Thank you, Derek!
That was one of the most interesting and captivating video i've ever seen. If that man was a teacher, school and studies would never be boring. Great work to everyone involved in that video!
cool
That guy explaining is very enthusiastic, it's a joy to see him talking about his passion
This guy is soooo passionate about his work, i love this video !!! Thank you so much for sharing your knowledge and passion, sir !
I'm glad you changed the thumbnail.  Putting 7 piconewtons told me literally nothing as I had no idea what a piconewton even meant yet.
You can see the passion and enthusiasm for science in Dr. Shaw😁He definitely loves his job.
Fascinating 🙂
1st class
This guy's uhhhhhh is longer then my lifespan 💀
I need to know why, at 12:15, he is suddenly holding a balloon and whether it was intentionally the exact same colour as his helmet.
Well I didn’t know the us was part of the is of measurements… that’s a first
Sheesh, when he said femtonewtons of force… and Derek went🙄🫤😵‍💫
Rich was great and really engaging, brilliant video, thank you!
It is very refreshing to see such a passionate individual. It was excellent to hear about their work!
Wow, they can almost measure my salary
Solid video! Super interesting also :)
cool
I didn't know Gabe Newell had a side business of measuring small things.
Nobody: Engineers: neglect mass
Dealer when
For those of us in laboratories around the world we could not perform our work without the standards labs.
math is related to science
Very good video!  This went way deeper than I thought it would.. I wish my mom would watch this video and it's entirety.. Gordons comment at the end about the life cycle of science and the creation of measuring tools is profound.
Wow That guy was so excited to share something he is so interested in, that 13min video felt like it was 5min long Lol This was amazing.
Well said at the end
To create a very small known mass precisely measure a larger mass of a soluble salt (like NaCl) and do the homeopathy thing diluting it many times then evaporate the solvent and viola you got a very precise fraction of the weight you put in
Super cool guy. I love it when someone gets excited about his topic
How many interesting object, places, stories, scientific devices are around the world and yet we are overwhelmed with advertisements... Thank you Derek for sharing with us all of this beauty
This man is great. I really had fun watching him talk.
Dr. Shaw's voice sounded a bit like Boris Johnson to me......
This guy uses the force.
This is crazy ..am im more excited that we can do this...with today's tech .... thats insane we can push that far !!!!!  They measure the point of a lazer !!?!? WHAT??? Astonishing!!!
Bro I felt like a kid listening to that man you gotta love him
That was fine !!
Veritasium is one of the unique content creator in the world, every video encourage us to learn more about it, Love from India 🇮🇳
1 mm of spider silk weights around 50 ng (nanograms). ¿Could you see it? Perhaps in a dark place with perpendicular light. The calculus is made from the sentence: "As a result, a strand long enough to circle the Earth would weigh about 2 kilograms (4.4 lb). ", from Wikipedia (spider silk). PS, correct me if I am wrong.
Dr Shaw needs his own youtube channel
I'm wary of these tests, for a place that doesn't take precautions of potential outside contamination to throw out measurements. If your not wearing p.p.e. around these minute ways of measuring, who says they are 100% correct?
We could measure even smaller forces if gravity is more than usual, right ?
*Imagine losing that 1μg thing...*
7:42 Derrick does know about buoyant force. I am still disappointed it was missed in the aerogel video
A thing that i found weird that how can they conclude The Kilogram is being lighter or heavier accurately? The scale could be wrong too, right?
Very interesting!
Will Sasso?
Dr Shaw is the guy we all need in our life, his enthusiasm is just amazing.
Dr. Shaw looks like Jon Favreau, and just as likeable
Are you telling me the force is real?  "I can lift this stone. I am not afraid. There is no stone, only light. Light is my guide and my saviour. With light I impress thee, toktik lights, utubb lights. Light impressions, light depressions, oh english what a odd language"
he seems to be having so much fun explaining these things
I just love it
10 nanograms? instead of 10 micrograms? 1.000000010kg
9:04 I love the excitement he had when he realize that the world can see his hard work
lots of -ishes.  how does that figure in? i do love the enthusiasm, though.
Dr. Shaw's enthusiasm is contagious. What a great scientist he seems to be!
He was so happy to have to explain this stuff, you could read it off his face. Awesome!
The passion this man has for his field is amazing.
That gentleman sounds so much like Penn Jillette.
Wouldn’t the sensors in a supercollider have to be more sensitive?
Hi Derek, just a personal feeling about the miniature, it’s not appealing enough I’ve skipped your video on mobile with dark theme without even noticing it was there. Maybe the stats say otherwise though, it’s maybe just me.
What sort of forces does light falling on an object effect the forces? Is it enough to be a factor? Do you have to take these measurements in complete darkness?
Dr Shaw is clearly passionate about his work. Great video!
i would be scared to fart in this place and not to ruin years of work
he sounds like such a nice guy
Science never fails, awesome. The best things to learn about balance and metal, cool stuff by the way. Look at this, which metal is more heavier than another, the big one. Bigger ones can be heavier than the small one. You might wanna put that on the label, your check list. It'll come in handy some day, just saying. Cool things to learn about balance and I love that, I wish I did my own balance too, awesome!
The guest is an incredible teacher, you can see he knows his stuff
I like this guy.  His excitement about what he does is inspirational.
It's mind blowing to thing, a scale used to weigh objects in the milligram range is such a big, hearty machine.
I love this man, such a great video
I’m glad even Americans think their system is stupid
The weight of the prototype kilogram was unchanged, sort of. It was, officially 1 kilogram, not because of it's weight, but because it was, by definition 1 kilogram.
I love the updated thumbnail.  It’s like I bookmarked the previous one in my mind, and you just brought me in the that macro shot of _micro_ measurements
WHY NO GLOVES, MASKS AND MEDICAL CAPS?!
@00:37 - I work in the automotive Industry since 2008. We regularly collaborate with companies/ engineers across the world - Japan, Germany, India, China, etc. etc. Ford, Tesla, GM are also a part of the collaborations regularly. I have seen drawings and other documents dating way past 2008. Never have I ever seen a proper engineering document that was not metric.   I have never had the opportunity to travel to the US so far, but as far as I can tell from a distance, the American Industrial operations (Including NASA) are all in "slave units"! 😀
I'm wondering if we can make measurements even more precise in space with centrifugal force...
That was awesone.  The dudes enthusiasm for his craft was infectious.
Derek, do you know how small the diffetential force measurements are in a cell phone to determine if its orientation is portrait vs landscape?
This is the most excited I have ever seen someone get about metrology.
Why didn't you let him talk about his balloon though?
Using atoms to measure atoms
12:11 Ukrainian DNA awesome
I use these videos to sleep at night out of boredom
Still cannot understand why you won't teach both "freedom units" and Metric.  How hard is it to learn a system that's base 10, instead of different bases depending on the unit? Europeans doesn't need to learn fractions, we do but it's not used for anything really...
How do you measure a strand of hair? Or a spec of dust?
i wonder if they all gained weight from ppl handling them, nobody probably ever wanted to mess with the original n when they did i imagine it was done correctly, i could see how over time the guy in charge of the other weights in the other countries would have a friend over on a special occasion or something like that n theyd physically handle it lol n fingerprints would absolutely add up    also, im not sure exactly how they were used, but if they were handled on some kind of regular basis to either keep track of its weight or use it to calibrate other weights that would b a more practical way for that much weight from fingerprints to build up  ..if thats even what the cause is..idk at all, im jus throwin an idea out there
Such a nice guy :D
Love his passion and clarity of explanation!
This dude was so fun to listen to!
Kudos to Dr Shaw who loves his subject and loves sharing it with us.
They keep confusing force and mass...
dr shaw is my new favorite dr
I have one such colleague at work who teaches and help co-design an amazing machine. Absolute treasure to work with someone with such a deep love for science and tech!  This guy is cut from the exact same cloth! Awesome!
Is this guy realted to McLaren boss Zak brown lol sounds identical
Great video !!!!!!!!!!
Could it be that the reference weights gained Mass over time because of handling? ..  that the things they were handling with accreted mass onto the references?    Put another way, we all know friction is basically "micro bonding" at contact surfaces; perhaps some of the material wears off from one surface to another?  Would sure be interesting to know more about how the reference weights were handled and whether the accretion were more likely to confer to the reference weight side then accrete to the "handling material" side.
This guy is amazing u can c how passionate he is in his trade.
Loving these videos about NIST! Any chance we've got more from there in the video pipeline? Regardless, keep up the great work!
"freedom units"
This man is so passionate and dedicated to his work. You can see his excitement when he gets the chance to explain and share his knowledge. Gotta love and respect it.
DEEZ NUTZ 8:49
I love metric Santa
WTF IS A KILOMETERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
Man! This is an amazing episode! 🧡
seriously, if you keep editing the thumbnail of videos, i will unsubscribe
I love how everyone is so happy to geek out and explain their domains and areas of expertise in these videos!
Don't point your balloon at me!  But seriously, cool guy.
You really should link to your other vids on these subjects, Derek!
All these Standards and Devices would become superfluous once the mathematical model of how plants grow due to particle interactions inside the earth is discovered.  For then it would be possible to grow Standard PLANTS sustained by the core of the Earth itself with 100% accuracy for all necessary measurements, large as well as small.  And the measurements themselves would simply be the ability of individuals to detect displaced growth on plants and then influense growth on definite plants through the solids, liquids and gases released by each to enable a particular animal to eat, so as to influence definite growth somewhere else.  And all trades would take place through transfers from one plant to another by programming internally the Material one releases (called EXCRETA at present) to the surrounding.
This video desperately makes me want to work at NIST, simply awesome
Oh man this guy loves measuring stuff. And I love him for it. I know there's lots of comments here already about how awesome Dr. Shaw is, but I felt the need to express it myself. The way his face lights up when Derek asked him if he *made* the 10 ug weight, was a joy to see. I will never pass up an opportunity to listen to people talk freely about their passion. It's always fascinating to see how rich and complex literally any topic can be. Thank you for sharing this with us Dr. Shaw and thank you Derek for always finding great people to talk to and taking you with us.
The other vids on "the roundest thing in the world" and "is the US actually metric" and "how we're redefining the kilogram" are good vids to watch to supplement this one. They're like 5+ yrs old
This guy reminds me of one of the professors I head,  Except for that my professor specialized in drones, (lift coefficients) reneging from temperature, atmospheric density (pressure), different states of meter, gravitational pull relative to the masses of the objects in our solar system, and the project he was working on when I graduated was the effect of gravitational waves on lift (how small/big the object head to be effected by the "gravitational anomaly's" [gravitational forces outside our solar system].
1:00 "Yes, it's stupid. 🙂" 😂😂😂😂
Wow this video was absolutely brilliant. This man talks with such passion I could listen to him for days.
Metric system already costed usa billions of dollar loss, congratulations
You really meet great people with a passion for the most bizarre things.
How many Noot'n are in a Pingu?
What an amazing dude! Thank you, you rock Sience Peep!
Wow! Dr. Shaw was such an amazing teacher here! I most loved the part of the video where you ask if they can measure the force of a laser pointer and he shrugged it off like it was nothing! So incredible!!!
Man this guy is the best! I'm happy he got camera time and his way of explaining and making all this understandable is amazing
Dr Shaw was so inspiring, he really loves his work and you can tell that!
Just wanna go there and measure 2 pieces of paper. On 1 I write "1kg stones" on the other I write "1kg feathers " And see what's heavier
Doesn't the force of a laser depend on the frequency of the light?
1:00 exactly my words... Its stupid
That was the most complete Veritasium episode ever
You should show the real map of India...... In this map you shows that the Jammu & Kashmir and laddakh as a part of Pakistan and china
Thanks for the video, both dr. Shaw and you were a wonder to listen to
Grams? Celsius? What the?
Isn't light massless?  If so the deflection being measured surely must be from thermal distortion or even molecular ablation ???
The 10 micrograms being pointed out by an arrow because there is no other way is just an incredible collision between "Real science" and "This feels like something from a cartoon"
Well. He is playing with mass and force and enjoying while earning money. F for appreciate.
1mg  = 1g/1000   and   1 microgram =  1g/1,000,000     just to correct a couple of mistakes.
When he said "Yes I made that." I realized he was interviewing what may as well be an IRL wizard. The machine makes no sense to me, the weight just looks like a wire to me. But even if my intuitions can't directly trust that, I know I still am putting my trust in this arcane machinery simply by using measurements of weight, or anything that has been weighed. So, nearly everything.
I regularly ponder with considerable amplitude if Derek is the best in finding the most enlightening topics in the world or if his simple yet spectacular production just makes it feel that way.
Finally a way to measure the amount of pressure it takes to set off my wife when she is already pissed off.
If there was ever an employee right for this job, it would be this guy 🙂 The enthusiasm he's displaying is fantastic
Must be stressful sometimes where one sneeze can make you lose all your equipment. Imagine have to look for your microgram on the floor :D
When someone says: What is cool about it "in my opinion"... He is living his job
Dr Shaw was incredible, you could almost touch his excitement! Very entertaining episode ,loved it.
why is happy doing measuring force
@derek please a follow up video in which you show how those experts invent/build (machinery needed) those tiny measurements tools like the atomic force microscope cantilevers. I mean a tool that can let only one photon to pass then a laser that measure such a tiny force? I wanna see that!
Oh, you changed video preview so people could understand the scale, but I'm sure most of people watching you can understand what does pico means
Dr shaw explains so clearly and understandably and his excitement and passion for the topic is infectious, what a great guy
freedom units😂
If photons don't have mass, how can they exert a force if F=M.A?       I'm sorry if that sounds stupid to you. As I am still in high school, I don't know this stuff and I thought photons don't have mass.
Man this gave me flashbacks to my precision/measurements course from second year mechanical engineering.  Curious if you chatted how they ensure the accuracy and precision of the instruments they use to produce the measurements they have.
I do love the scientist working there. His explanations were so complete, interesting, and easy to understand that Derek just had to sort of guide the conversation a little bit. So very clearly passionate about what he does, and we love to see it.
5:28 i remember when I used to care about my ability to rewrite equations like this. Ah, highschool. Good times...
I like the guy
I've just received the news that I've won today's give-a-away. I don't remember entering or even hearing about it. Would anyone like the details?
I love these kinds of videos where you find an expert and just let them rip. His raw knowledge and enthusiasm was captivating.
Fascinating. I've always enjoyed those that are so very focused on doing solid science. And measurement can get real deep into the rabbit hole. Fun.
11:59 Wow, it's so inspiring to see how inspired Dr. Shaw get by the question of the laser pointer.
Hmmm im getting deja vu here. I feel that this video was uploaded like few years ago.
0:41 wrong map of India
This video is literally the answer to my question in the YouTube comment in the previous Veritasium video.  Thank you 😊
Ooooh, so close!  You almost gave me the formula for a concrete mass in terms of Plank's constant and "the speed of light"="time", if you just tell me, as one of your clueless but fascinated layman students, what exactly the "Cs" subscript of the  Δv at 5:44 signifies.  ("Cesium", or something?   Got that the Δv means  "change in velocity"="acceleration"="push", right?)    Dude, have mercy.  I'm 63 -- not much time left!  _Please_ don't make me search for that little tidbit of esoterica???   Seriously would be grateful.  Fantastic video, by the way -- This one's key.   Thank you for all your work.
His passion for his work is wonderful!
One of the rare videos where Derek doesn't have to explain something on the side. He pretty much stood there and let Gordon do all the explaining. Fantastic man.
*This guy was really REALLY excited to talk about this LOL*
This guy is the Gaben of weights.
This dude really loves his job.
6:43 :D i use the same method to mesure distances.
I've worked a lot with atomic force microscopy and in my opinion it's one of the most interesting measuring tools we have nowadays. Would be cool to make a video on it!
Wouldn't it be easier to print the desired weight on a printer that prints one atom at a time?  Then you will know the most accurate weight.
Is he using a compliant mechanism for the femptonewton measurements? Looked like it was just one part. Really cool
this guy is great!
Fantastic video!!!!!!
Dr Shaw the 🐐
I know damn well he be grabbing them weights with his fingers when nobodys around, IM SURE OF IT.
Loved watching Dr. Shaw. Thank you so much!
🫡🙏🏽🤟🏽🤟🏽🤟🏽🙏🏽🫡
Another great Veritasium video, Dr Shaw was excellent. Plus from these comments I learnt a new word! I knew about metallurgy and meteorology, but metrology? So at age 70, once again, I'm shown that I'm never too old to learn something!
These types of electromagnetic balances have been used for decades in aerospace wind tunnels.  The general design and application was invented by Dr Fred Eastman at the University of Washington during WWII.  He never patented them, instead wanting this type of balance to be available for all research.
I love people like the one he’s interviewing. You can genuinely feel the love for what he does.
Americans are so stupid. They need to switch to the metric system already.
12:16 "Thats a good question!" As he gestures violently with a bright orange balloon
Dealers be taking notes from this video
Well…one can finally measure just how small trumps penis is… interesting 🤔
You know, this guy is pretty awesome!
Make this guy a regular guest! Fabulous passionate teacher.
0:46 Most Americans can't handle the truth as they are too busy drumming their chest for their Imperial system and how they are so special as the industries long time ago adapted to the metric system for the sake of standards and saving money by doing so. I just wish that would happen also in other branches to stop loosing expensive space probes to confused measuring systems. I also recommend people dealing with international partners to be precise, resp unmistakable when it comes to writings like dates yy/mm/dd vs mm/day, etc. I suggest spelling out the month to avoid any misunderstandings and double check if you use commas or dots to write large numbers and use proper labeling of numbers if they represent the proper currency, weight, distance, number size as such small errors can have VERY expensive consequences when dealing with authors from various countries. Blind assumptions that others use the same method as you should NEVER be presumed, especially when large amounts of money are involved, directly or indirectly. Speaking of decades of experience in the chemical industry and data research for production plants to prepare production badges. The difference in cultures and throughout history was and always is a mix of precision, history and culture studies and reminds one why international standards are to damn important for ALL of us even mostly indirectly.
I want to cuddle the cute chubby bearded Samson man...he's so soft and fluffy.
But which is heavier, a kilogram of feathers, or a kilogram of steel?
Guys voice reminds me of Penn Jillette.
This guy, Dr. Shaw is so passionate.
I love this guy. He doesn’t work. He LOVES his job. Soooo jealous.
This is the opposite of "dick measuring"
Now, how would we measure the force of gravity on a positron?
How do they compensate for the interference from the mass of the machine itself? Do they even matter?
What happened at 12:18 that made him pick up the balloon?
You can't say, that this is the force needed to pull a DNA strand and leave us there hanging! I demand a video on DNA pulling! :D
I think this not the tiniest measured weight.
I found some really small weights in a cupboard at the lab I work at.  The milligram weights were really cool to look at for some reason and I really needed out.
Love Dr. Shaw energy 🔥
Is that jon favreau i see?🌚
I love how you find these super passionate people incredibly deep in their respective field! It's such a pleasure learning from your videos when you see professionals like Dr. Shaw dive into the subject and really put everything they do over decades in an easy to understand frame. Thank you!
freedom unit hahahahaha
freedom units 😂👍
I'm nor sure, But I don't remember seeing you face (as much) (live) while someone explains something, and I think it is a "must" like...  I'm not the only one that is dumbfounded to the (LITERAL) actual explanation to this "absurd explanation" of the phenomena that rules our universe... right?
@1:30 guys this is actually inaccurate. The uncertainty remains the same(uncertainty of obj that measured objects weight) it is. The percentage uncertainty that increases
10:05 no it’s not, any girl would be happy to have it, and I bet it has a great personality 🫡
If Gaben decided to be a scientist.
How do they measure the temperature that accurately? (Having a human inside the room should change the temperature)
Oh my... Dorcor Shaw, thank you for this.
This was a really cool video! That machine was fun to see. Sometimes I wonder what other things such as this exist. Maybe there exists somewhere a speedometer that verifies the speed of light? 🤷‍♂
I'm looking at that guys hardhat and wondering if he's wearing it for comedic effect, as it looks like something you'd but at the toy isle at Walmart.
Derek. It's called a tripod. You use it for a camera.
bro was too much excited and proud to show derek all the things he had in his lab
My Weed Man's digi needs to visit this place.
"Freedom units" ok cringe lord
7:52 metre per square second is the correct unit.
What an interesting person to get to talk to
My work we deal with measures of mg too. So glad to see people out there passion about their work.😊
Hello, I would like to suggest a topic for a new video. Lightning strikes, how does the force move, differences between cloud-to-ground and ground-to-cloud. Could you actually capture the energy. How much power would there be. Maybe Nikola Tesla had some cool ideas on that matter.
Loved the excitement and so much deep knowledge
Great video, but I noticed there were several parts where he was basing the measurement against other measurements, like voltage and the interferometer measurement... How are these other variables measured, tested for accuracy, what's the error % and what's the limits of what can be done to drive these variables down with confidence? Definitely can lead to an entire lecture I'm sure, appreciate the video!
*burger units
somebody get @thefat electrician on here... we have a bonafied American here saying us is metric, he'll flip XD
In the day I could throw a gram, half a gram or 3 1/2 pretty close by hand
Gordon is The Man! Oh man. So much passion!
4:55 are those actual measurements of the reference weights? If so, what happened to the blue weight in the end of forties?
Next video: measuring the largest force in the universe
a force of approximately 42 yoctonewtons. A yoctonewton is one septillionth (that’s 1 followed by 24 zeroes)
Was waiting for the sneeze.
That was so rad!
“What do you guys weigh with all this equipment?” “Bananas “
Destins dad would likely enjoy this
That's what she said
As if Veritasium guy didn't know what 10 grams felt like.
This is the most awesome video yet. It's such a pleasure too see such a scientist so passionate for scientific development.
Freedom unit lol
These weights and forces just blow my mind. What also threw me somewhat is that these microscopic weights are being measured in what's not a clean room and not only is it not a clean room but Dr Shaw has unrestrained long hair and a beard in the not clean room. I would expect that a hair would be orders of magnitude heavier than a fingerprint.
This is small?!  I think it is average 🥲
Damn that little weight blended right in with the cracks in my phone screen
I did not know Jon Favreau did this for a side hustle.
13-12-2022  Bangalore  India  Very interesting  subject.  Are you aiming  to achieve this perfection?  " One  gram or any mass must be equal to so much /so many atoms.'  One gram of mass  =  (N. atoms)  raised  to X number.   This is   to be the standard.
What is the source of the sound at the end of all of your videos Derek? The one that sounds like some type of laser gun
I like to think of myself as a nerd. And nothing makes me happier than veritasium showing off all the other nerds around the world. Hell yeah measure that laser pointer!
très cool
@alphaphoenix did a cool video about measuring atomic properties of a materiel sample. This kinda reminds me of that.
Watching a person who is enamored by their job, explain their job, is one of the most beautiful things there is. Gordon, loves his job. And that is awesome to experience.
I was going to say had I known you were here for a visit, I'd have shown you around, but looks like you were in Gaithersburg and not Boulder.
really enjoyed hearing that guy talk about his job. its clear he loves it
Dr Shaw is awesome
You should seriously have Dr. Shaw back at some point.
The man gave you a free clickbait arrow to what appeared to be emptiness and you didn't use it for the thumbnail 😱 you would've been so justified too
One place where tiny forces are used is in LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory).  We use the force of a precise light source to calibrate a detector capable of measuring tiny displacements 1/1000th the diameter of a proton.
The enthusiasm in his voice is unparalleled
I hope one day to have a job I'm as passionate about as Gordon does here.
One standard sent men to the Moon, the other didn't
You can tell that Dr. Shaw loves his work. The passion and love for the science really shines through.
All the weed smokers got a a+ on the gram part
Derek Muller: oh no i don't do too much of talking today Video team: let's film you filming Dr Shaw so it shows that you contribute to the group project
I watched this ten times and I think I fully understood 5 whole sentences. 😂😭
Love how Dr Shaw still has the last of his non-greyed hair that he's not cutting off haha
Let’s see where my guys at. A dollar bill weighs? And how about a nickel?
Dope
I want to hang out with that guy.  And I don’t want to ever hang out with anybody.
Freedom units … 😂
So what your saying is Bs?
Now I know how I get same amount of cheese ever time. Thanks man
that guy loves his job and I love him for it :P awesome video <3
What is the physics behind the laser pointer generating a force? How can a photon transfer kinetic energy if light doesn't have mass (and hence no kinetic energy either)?
This man waited his whole life for this moment.
This video shows how science Is a humanistc exiting form of Art and professors are actually artists , well the good ones .
I love this guy. I hope he teaches classes somewhere and his students appreciate his passion. :)
Comic book guy will be pleased.
I love Gordon's passion! Clearly loves what he does and cares about the details!
your videos make me happy... i dont know why
Love it
US currency paper bills are 1 gram.
🔬
I really like watching all of your videos. I always curious about how the Pyramid of Egypt were build. If you can please make video about how the Pyramid was build and what kinds of physics did they use to move those huge stone blocks . Looking forward to see it.
The way Dr Gordon Shaw excited by explaining things to Derek shows how much he loves his job.
I feel like these guys should be in a clean room and full bunny suit so that they don't spray saliva on those tiny masses and equipment.
Another certified classic Veritasium video
destin's dad probably loved this
0:47 Yet another reason why the Imperial measurement system needs to be ditched. lol  And that's coming from a Brit, where we still cling on to imperial measurements, and I've had to use both for a lot of things. eg. We often still use stones, pounds, and ounces for things like body weight.  But I never fully got to grips with imperial anyway, as I always forget whether it's 12 or 14 pounds in a stone, etc. (it's 14 pounds in a stone.)  It was surprising to me when I was younger, to discover that the US still uses Imperial for so many things. I guess we do use MPH on motorways.  Imperial is also still used in PCB manufacture, but with a mixture of Metric as well. It's very strange, and confusing. (they use "mil" / "thou" a lot for things like drill hole diameters, trace widths and spacing.)  I only recently started measuring body weight in Kg. Once you get used to how it equates relative to what you're used to, it's fine. (a lot like using different currencies that you're not used to.)  And Metric is SO much easier to do calculations with vs Imperial. Everything in base-10 (or whatever the proper term is).  P.S. I genuinely have no idea how much a "quart" is. lol And then there are gallons vs litres, two different versions of "tonnes" vs "tons". sigh  "A ton is an imperial unit of mass equivalent to 1,016.047 kg or 2,240 lbs. A tonne is a metric unit of mass equivalent to 1,000 kg or 2,204.6 lbs."  The mix of units can cause huge problems. Not even the top scientists get it right sometimes. Like the space probe that crash-landed because they mixed up Imperial and Metric units. lol  And yes, I realize the irony that the Imperial system was first developed... in Britain. It's all our fault, sorry. lol
Amazing
So much fun!  oh man!  tiny tiny forces!  excellent video!!!
Just waiting until my doctor prescribes a 10 femtogram dose and hands me a pill cutter and a 1mg pill to take for the rest of my life.
Finally I can measure the size of my gonads.
I would love to work there in that lab. So cool!
That’s not a “special lens” that’s an extended barrel
Hooray for freedom units 🇺🇸 🦅
For a guy who understands so much about gravity, has the world best scales AND is supposed to be smart, can anyone explain to me, why he's failed to notice he's morbidly obese?
I honestly had very little interest in this when I first started watching. The passion and energy from Dr. Shaw captivated me though and I found myself wanting to know more as the video went on. It truly is a special thing when the right type of person with the right type of passion find themselves in the perfect place. His ability to explain things that are very complex in a way that the average person with much less knowledge on the subject can understand is a great skill in and of itself.
This guy needs more facetime, I loved his talk! His enthusiasm and excitement was infectious
Now that we have things like the watt balance, I guess we can finally answer whether the old kilogram standard is increasing or decreasing.
who made those Grams and miligrams steels?
Ve = ☀️
Please don’t hold the camera in your hand while filming.
For someone who measures things so precisely for a living, he says "ish" and "about" a lot.
Recently retired Science teacher here. This gentleman is a natural teacher, whether he knows it  or not.  VERY interesting and enjoyable to listen to!  Also, VERY well filmed, this one must have been a challenge, but GREAT JOB!
This was one of my favourite episodes because of Dr Shaw, it's one thing explaining a science, it's another to do it with passion and truly enjoy educating people on a subject.
Yes I am fascinated by this video I once owned semi micro balance but it broke😥 i really really love this stuff❤️ Thanks for sharing ☮️
Funny how at 6:07 a machine, that probably costs Millions is hold togehter by zipties😂
Consider where your soul will spend eternity, heaven or hell.  You don’t want to end up in hell because you rejected the Sacrifice Jesus has made all who repent and turn to him by faith.  We are all guilty of sin.  We lie, steal and look with lust in our hearts.  We are all Guilty before a Holy and Righteous God.  GOD is not just all loving and overlook your sin.  He is loving but sin He will Judge because He is Perfectly good. The Good news is God the Father sent His Son Jesus Christ who was perfectly Holy to pay the penalty for your and my sin out of Love for us.  We can’t keep the Law we break most all commandments.  But Jesus fulfilled ALL by his perfect thoughts, words, deeds and motives for us because we could not. Jesus loved all humans and God the Father perfectly.  Turn, repent of your sin and confess Your thankfulness for what Jesus did for you.  Put your faith in the perfection and the righteousness of Christ.  Jesus was raised from death to give you new life; death has been defeated. Out of love and grace eternal life is promised to those who have faith                 ,........... ,.., ,.,
So, lasers do have a "kick" to them. As a kid I would imagine when I turned on a pointer it would kick like a gun and make laser weapon noises. Fascinating!
now I know I wasnt crazy when I thought I could feel a laser tickle my leg hairs....
'Our Country is "Secretly Metric" - Doesn't that seem crazy!? - A Professional: "Yes it's stupid" '
"Like when you're stretching a DNA molecule"  Yeah, I totally have an intuition of how that feels! XD
I just love this channel, and I don't comment very much on YouTube. Thank you for respecting the science and doing what you do!
He seems so excited by his job.
I believe there is a joke to be made about measuring small things
:0
Freedom units 😂
Love how the thumbnail said "7 piconewtons" and now it says "0.000<...>07 Newtons" Did no one understand wtf a piconewton was? Lol
this is crazy. who funds this stuff? which government or university department are they hiding in? who commissions their work?! awesome stuff
Next time I round to the nearest Newton, I'll remember this video and think of all the human work hours spent measuring units of force I truncate by the millions
Good stuff.  👍
astonishing
Nicely explained!
This is so cool! Thanks
Derek got carried in this video. Lol. Great video and Dr Shaw is a great host!
Youtube needs to make a second like button for videos this good.
Great coverage, thanks! Now lets see NIST Electrical lab :)
This was an excellent video.   NIST certainly has people who are very invested in the various standards that they maintain. I'd argue that half the value of NIST standardization is down to these awesome ambassadors of science.  Thank you for helping us to see behind the curtain of this very obscure,  but hugely consequential institution!
Wait!!!! My DNA is stretch with a lazer😮
Nerds will be nerds.....😁
As an electrical engineer, we depend on our instruments to be traceable to a national standards laboratory.  Here in the US, that's NIST.  It's absolutely essential to make sure we measure the right thing and know we are measuring the right thing.  And for much of this sort of thing, NIST traceability isn't a one time thing - most instruments have to be periodically rechecked against NIST traceable instruments.  This, by the way, doesn't mean we send all our instruments to NIST every year.  What it means is somebody has a reference that may actually have gone to NIST (or one of the other labs that traceable to NIST, like Keysight, formerly Agilent, formerly HP).  So, its value is known compared to national standards.  That reference is then compared against our instruments.  Another cool thing NIST does is, you know those radio clocks (the ones sold as "Atomic Clocks")?  In the US, they get their time signal from NIST.  NIST has a radio station, WWVB, near Fort Collins, CO that broadcasts the signal those clocks use.
Dr Shaw is the man.
I’d love to see Gordon Shaw do a series on metrology.
iphone without a case you got no human grace, your phone without a case....case....case
Loved this video! Could listen to Gordon Shaw all day long.
Nerd Alert!!! Very interesting. Thanks for the video :)
I work on an ambulance and I administer fentanyl as a narcotic pain management. We can administer up to 100 mcg at a time but typically administer 50 mcg. I never contemplated what a tiny amount of drug that actually is.
This video was like taking a tour and you're asking the tour guide all the right questions
This guy is rad.
Assuming g varies depending on where you are on Earth, 1 kg be equal but the Newtons would be different. Fg = mg, g varies
haha I was saying to myself a 24mm probe should do the trick and bam he pulls it out
I love how much he uses the suffix "ish" for someone who makes the most accurate measurements on earth.
This guy is cool. He seems to really enjoy his job and does a great job explaining things.
"1 in = 2.54 cm." Uh, can I get some more significant figures on that? "1 in = 2.54000 cm." ok
What a nice video ! Thanks to both of you!
>new veritasium video >look inside >more physically standardized measurements
This man visited the Room Temperature Room!
This dude is smart, even enough to break it down for us.  And his excitement clearly shows straight through.   I think he was just ecstatic someone else came through to show his work to a large group of people, honestly
the shots of you holding the camera make you appreciate how natural and enthusiastic these guests can be while talking into a lense
for someone who can measure so accurately, he sure does say "ish" a lot. Incredible stuff
Things like the kibble balance are awe inspiring
At work we have a microbalance that measures a 1 mg weight as 999  micrograms most days. Not as accurate as this lab. But we have to measure little residues like 30-40  micrograms.  I did not trust it and could not find a smaller weight.  So I took an eyelash that measured  36 micrograms. Then measured the eyelash and the 1 mg weight. Together they weighed  about 1034-1036 micrograms so I trusted the balance was OK for the range of my sample size. Took the eyelash an put it in a labeled vial for future use. Nice video.
This guy absolutely loves his work and you can see it in everything he says. I love it!
This video was a great source of information
That was cool, Thanks for letting me learn about this sort of thing for free and putting in the work to let this happen
So amazing that people like this man exists. He clearly had a great deal to do in making this machine to unfold the secrets of the universe. There’s no better way to measure the weight of something in our known world that at that facility. Thanks for sharing your view of our world Derek!
The guy explaining was so informative and kept my attention which is rare!!
I wonder how many times someone was handling one of those very small reference weights, then _SNEEZED,_ and the weight was subsequently never found?   😊😊😊
Oh yes very special place and capacitance. For too small of a force, it would be the choice, or if there's another way to get a tiny variation... But still capacitance. Cool! Thank you!
Freedom units 😂 America you are as stupid as they come
Are those zip ties? 6:05
Capacitor I guess.
And I thought I was passionate bout my work!!  This was an amazing video!!  I'm very happy to have this new knowledge.  And I happy our world has people like this to find these things out about our world!
There's a beautiful irony in this person's work. I was amused by how often he, a metrologist, gave estimates in "-ish" and "about." Yet this is profoundly humbling about the nature of truth and science: we only make measurements as point estimates of a truth and we acknowledge the limitation that we will only get so close. It would be nice to hear how quantum mechanics play a role in metrology.
All these traces back to the speed of light, which you have already shown cannot be measured, and we only assume is a constant.
I’m smart enough to know I’m dumb. These types of people, like Gordon, are fantastic.
Dr Shaw was amazing in this video! Well done! 🎉🎉
That guy is so exited someone is finally interested in his work 😂
love nerds like this doctor....so brilliant
I love this guy. The joy he exudes when explaining his work gives me hope
I clicked on this video because the thumbnail kept changing every time it showed up in my feed. So now I feel like I voted on which thumbnail I liked more.
2:24 subdivision is one of the advantages of the imperial system. You can DIRECTLY go between units (pound / ounce, gallon / quart / cup / ounce, foot / inch) with subdivision. This means you can get whole subunits with nothing but a balance (IE 1 ounce of sugar from a pound of sugar). You CANNOT do this directly with a base 10 system. Not a big deal in today's modern world, but a huge pain in times gone by.
At this rate they'll be able to measure my will to live
Dr Shaw is super cool.  Great explanations.
What a short episode 🥺
You can clearly tell that man got a huge passion for his work
This guy looks like Jimmy Kimmel but more scientific
Free and easy content for Derek. All he has to do is to hold the camera and post-production
"doesn't that seem crazy?" "Yes, it's stupid." with a somewhat smiley but dead inside kinda face killed me
Going to need the Veritasium team to hire this guy for every video from now on. He is so excited about what he does and it makes me excited to listen to him.
NIST workers are at the bleeding edge of science. Some of the best people in the world take everything to the "Nth degree" to define standards. Some of the most incredible is technology, defining for the US government to what level of security are provided by encryption models.  So people can make very, very, very to the Nth degree decisions and be confident it's based upon sound science, not Trump science.
Astonishing precision.. Amazing equipment.. Very cool.
I'm pretty sure that if you're reading this, it's because you're looking for a way to measure the smallest forces in the universe. Well, I have good news: you don't need a device that can measure the tiniest forces in the universe! You just need a device that can measure a slightly larger force than what you want to measure, and then a bunch of other stuff that probably goes against your ethics.  I mean, sure, it's possible that there are some people out there who are willing to go through all of this trouble for science. But for most of us? It's probably not worth it.  So go ahead and do it if you want. Just don't say I didn't warn you when your lab gets shut down by the FDA or something like that happens because of your ethical violations (which is definitely going to happen).
I love how into measurements the guy was……. 100% loved this
What a great guy.
Love how excited he is to explain and show the concepts. Kinda like show and tell when we were kids
1:14 gotta hurt having that happen at that age lol
Wow that guy clearly knew his stuff and seems hella passionate about it, thanks for sharing
I wonder if that they find a scienctific discovery in measuring, so that they would have a new unit of measuring and have a new name for it!
That was awesome fun! Go figure. Science!
So coooool!
"-measure Skywalkers Force"....
I also wants to know for small size measurement
I want to hang out with ya'll and just listen to the conversation. I love this much passion for anything!
"ish" the new measurement error ratio
Im just so glad this lab exists thats awesome
NIST = Nerds In Search of Truth
The wire miligram mass calibration weights are made of platinum 90% iridium 10% wire. The extreme precision miligram scales actually use a polonium 210 static charge neutralizer. The extreme sensitivity balance used for measuring the light pressure though 😲
wtf is a kilogram. tell me the units in no of  bald eagle per donuts
Wow, came here to compliment what an awesome dude that guy seemed, how passionate he is about his work, and how he appears to be able to explain things very simply with ease...but looks like just about everyone else before me has beat me to the punch :-D
man this is so fascinating! Ima have to stay in school!
Veritasiam always comes up with most most misleading titles. I was expecting something like a way to measure quantum gravity or weak force. But it is simply a way to weigh weights. Video is good though, but title is misleading.
Do tremors in the earth's surface mess with the readings of these devices?
There’s a tiny hair or piece of lint under my screen protector that lines up perfectly with the 10 microgram weight 😆 just FYI
This guy is gonna maim somebody some day
9.8m/s2   just like building 7!
Oh, I used to be subbed to this guy. Then he explained that all his titles are click bait.  {:o:O:}
What is a kilogram? We use pounds
i sure learned my grams and ounces but it sure as hell wasn’t in school
Man this guy is awesome
1000 times less than the force needed to stretch a DNA molecule....OMG.
you can use this scale to measure out LSD doses accurately!
Dr Shaw is supercool!
I liked that last statement
the thing i love the most about this channel is that it provides a great way for these scientists to jus nerd out about what they're doing
Great vid
So cool to see someone who is really passionate about his job!
We need more people in the world like this <3
I'm very curious how pharmaceutical companies manage to equally distribute doses of 0.1mg into every single pill. Worth a video?
I enjoyed 10o percent "ish" of this video.
I think it's interesting that the Platinum Iridium weights didn't stay the same weight over several years and that it's a mystery why?
You can measure the tiniest force in the universe why don't you get back to me and let me know what the weight of a human soul is when it's inside the body separated by the weight of a human being then you'll know what the smallest measurement really means
I was so confused as to who was employing this dude, thinking all along that NIST was probebly the only organisation who would. lo and behold, it was the National Institute of Standards and Testing (NIST) all along!
i dont know why but i am so captivated by this video
See? No clickbait needed. I even liked the video.
I loved this guy's passion for his job.
🤯🤯
thumbsup Dr Shaw
Hey now, someone told me gravity wasn't a force once. 🤨
The science of measuring is pretty amazing.
"That's roughly the force required to stretch out a strand of DNA" "A laser pointer is about 7 piconewtons" Ok he's definitely just showing off now XD. Awesome to see someone who's just plain delighted by what he's doing.
I love how excited this guy is about weighing stuff.
Interesting guest!
He’s so excited and happy to have someone interested in learning about his work!
I love how exuberant Gordon is, it's nice to see someone who basically gets to play with the things they love for a living. I bet he has never worked a day since he first started in his field.
That is a cool guy you can tell he is happy with what he does
This guy is great ! He's so jolly, funny, and full of life. I'll bet he's a blast to work with.   I also love this mind blowing stuff, but none of it matters without the people.
Dude is an extrovert for sure! Had energy and explain energy as well.
If that thing drops on the floor, you ain't gonna find it
I build Brookfield viscometers, vapor analyzers etc.. come show some love and I'll show some secrets ❤
Wait wait wait ✋.....does a fingerprint have weight? Nvm dumb question.
Changes in Q of the cantilever.
Ъъ.
He's definitely a mass man
I’m amazed by everything said on this video, thanks Derek to present us Gordon. Great video
The dudes shirt if from DXl… I used to have a few like it.
A commonplace example of accurate small measurement is pharmaceuticals. I have medications with active-ingredient doses of 400mcg, 25mcg and 2.5mcg.
Lol
Neat
Dr. Shaw is the perfect example of a man who has absolutely found his “thing.” Wonderful watch!
Funniest part of this video: the vacuum chamber with K20 is obviously labeled with a cheap Dymo labeler someone bought at OfficeMax.  Also, Derek's expression at 10:45 when Dr. Shaw says "that's the force you'd need to stretch out a DNA molecule" and Derek is just like ".... what??"
Did he invent that balance? He just speaks so excitedly and authoritatively about exactly how it works. It'd be interesting to see them actually amass a million of those little 1mg weights and compare it to a Kg just to see what the total amount of uncertainty adds up to. Would it be less than a single mg? I think that would be pretty impressive. When they got down to talking about femtonewtons I was curious about how it compared to LIGO, it always amazes me just how much we've advanced in 50 years from creating the first microprocessors to modern commercial CPUs that now have to be designed and created using processes that care about the path and flow of every individual electron. And we're measuring the force imparted by individual photons. Also how does it work if you take gravity out of the equation, I got the impression that some of the equipment wouldn't work if it was on the ISS. What methods and equipment would work, and could you just assume g = 0 or do you have to measure the exact microgravity, how insane does it get, would your numbers be thrown off by the additional mass of an astronaut inside the same module?
this field of science really measures up to standards......
I love this guys energy! I wish I had a mentor like him.
Is it just me or does this guy sound a lot like Penn Gillette?
Dollar is a gram. Nickel is 5. Anything smaller than that gets one kicked out the trap!
Awesome
Dr Shaw is amazing! I could listen to him for hours. Incredible video once again, thanks Derek!
Fantastic video!
You can really tell this guy enjoys his job. You can also tell he finds great joy in teaching people about his job 😁.
Lol tell me you overthink without telling me you overthink
I know some scientists,  who become a monk.
I would point out that NPL in Teddington does a lot of work of calibration of SI units and standard measures outside of the kilogram
This guy LOVES his job.  You can tell.  I wonder if the gravity of the earth affects the weight of these objects.  Maybe this research should be done in space?  Just asking...
They talked about measuring femtoNewtons. In the laboratory where I earned my Ph.D. we measured something 1,000 times smaller, attoNewtons (aN), using a magnetic resonance force microscope (MRFM). That is the force a single unpaired electron exerts on a micron-sized magnet that is about 100 nanometers away. It's a painfully hard experiment.
Are we just gonna skip past the kilograms all diverging? What?
This guy makes me nervous just watching him. Relax bro.
Dr. Gordon Shaw just seems like a cool ass dude
Thumbs up for Dr Shaw for the energy as well as the explanation specially at the end of it .. What we usually forget is that this video is edited .. so we probably won't see a lot of what he actually put in ..
I did a campaign in my persuasion and propaganda class in college at Utah State called "Go Metric—It's 10 times better."  The English system is sooooooo stupid.  Hey news flash...the king is dead that we based the "foot" off of.  We can stop using his body part to measure length.
I love this guy , does he have a youtube channel?
I love how Veritasium finds people that are passionate and knowledgeable in their fields. You can just tell that Gordon loves what he does and is interested in sharing it with the world.
Measure the force of my fart next
Wow, this is nice; we're getting an NIST series of sorts. This is fascinating.
Weird thing to relate too but the tweezers seen around 1:50 are what my company uses 😂
There is no „size“ in infinity, so the the title should be „How to measure the tiniest forces related to our size known so far“ (pretty long, i know, lol). But even then it becomes obvious that there is a problem in our view; we see US in the „middle“ when we judge what is small and what is big. 🙃
PMEL was probably the hardest USAF specialty to get into.
"That's a very good question", he says as he points the orange balloon at the camera and puts it down.  Wait.. did I miss something?
So, Plato was correct. It is better to represent reality as “ideal forms” as opposed to actual objects.
This man really said plonk XD
Love that he's got his helmet on...
Freedom units are the true units of the universe.
You can tell how much he loves his job! He's so passionate about sharing his knowledge. That's beautiful to see.
This is what I love so much about science... there's nothing like listening to someone who's passionately sharing knowledge about the most random stuff that you _kind of_ understand, when you're suddenly hit with that indescribable buzz when the dots in your mind all join up and you just _get it._  The life-long learner's natural dopamine hit... awesome.  👌🤓
Gordon is a blessing to the mind and ears
Well, that guy needs his own channel.
Homie wearing a hard hat in a room full of objects weighing between 1-10 micro grams.
10:30 i dont like how you keep taking the camera off of him to show yourself filming him. Its distracting. Amazing video otherwise
This video was way cooler than I even expected.
You can thank NIST and BIPM for allowing our modern world to function. Pretty much everything ever manufactured in the past 80 years or so works because of defined and traceable standards.
The wing nut flipping was cool. Moment of inertia. As it turns out, math is pretty weird. Just looking at sets of 3 coin flips - bit flips - trips me out. Hit absorption, it can't be.  It just cannot be.
such a good video and the host is amazing
Given my ignorance I didn't know measuring less than a microgram was possible.
I want to be friends with this guy!
this is super neat
You keep interchanging the terms "weight" and "mass" and mixing in "force." A balance measures mass, not weight. Weight is force; mass is not.
this was fascinating, thanks Derek
It still makes my head spin that nobody can measure the speed of light in one direction and that we no longer use a weight of an object as reference to mass, but light.  But I'm so fascinated about all this. I studied manufacturing technology which included courses on measuring accuracy etc and this is just a nerd's wet dream. This was definitely one of the coolest videos all year. And one of the least exciting or visually communicating thumbnails :D I think it would be more intriguing if you had for example the kilogram weight somewhere on the screen as well for imagination and context, because you have zero idea what the heck is that metallic piece in darkness and random red beam. Heck, throw in a scale and a ruler while you're at it for measurement references :-D  I think I saw Cody's Lab trying to measure force caused by fotons from laser once in time, very cool experiment.
Gordon really feel like the science version of pen from pen and teller
this guy’s cool. I’d bet he’s got a sweet MTG collection.
Metric is great for doing math but freedom units are the best. fight me.
I swear this had a different thumbnail this morning
Very interesting!
Not sure if this video measured up to your standards
I cant help but feel there's potential for a great collaboration with Dr Shaw and Destin's Father on measuring things.
This guy loves his job and I really would like to work with him.
its so awesome how much this guy likes talking about this
Hello Derek, great video again ! I often wonder about micro gravitation variations on earth due to latitude, altitude, rotation, position relative to the sun, the moon and the galaxy centre, wouldn't it be a good subject ?
Dude this guy's energy is contagious
When he got the vibrating Fento Newton thing I lost it, AMAZING
Recently retired Science teacher here. This gentleman is a natural teacher, whether he knows it  or not.  VERY interesting and enjoyable to listen to!  Also, VERY well filmed, this one must have been a challenge, but GREAT JOB!
I love that this lab has both a scientific purpose in addition to a practical purpose. I think it would be cool to see more research like this in the real world.
Man this guy is awesome. I love when people know what they're talking about
GabeN really be getting nerdy
“Freedom units” 🤣😂🤣
Years ago I found an electronic scale in the garbage pile of a factory that had closed.  Took it home and played with it, was very surprised it could easily measure stuff as light and small as an eyelash.  It was very similar to the first one that Derek checked out in the video, so clearly those large weights they set on it were not much of a test of its capabilities by a long stretch.
Adding all the zeros in the thumbnail was a good call. I clicked this time.
I feel like the hard hat is just for show and serves no safety purpose.
*sigh* this would have been nice last Wednesday for my exam question: Design an experiment to measure the force of a migrating cell on its substrate
This man’s energy for his work is captivating. Could listen to him explain his research all day long
8:50 Ah yes "Freedom Units" 😭
How does they measure the amount of the voltage being applied to the capacitor?
measuring the pushing force of a photon of light... that's crazy!!!
Knowledge flow through you when you Love what you Do
"Thats a good question!" as he waves an orange sausage shaped balloon at the camera...
I've missed your videos .. Keep'm coming .. and this one was a lot of fun'ish heheheh .. he seemed like a nice guy that loves to talk about this work ..
aight ill be back in a week once you settle on a title and a thumbnail
Wow
Dr. Gordon needs to be teacher, if he's not one already.  So charismatic and so enthusiastic and so knowledgable about this topic.
There is no such thing as "freedom units" it's called standard measure 🙄
this is what scientists do with our tax dollars
NIST is such an incredible institution, it's hard to overstate how important of a role they play in our world. Massive respect to everyone who works there, and thank you Derek for featuring them in your videos and educating more people about what they do.
One of the rare videos where Derek doesn't have to explain something on the side. He pretty much stood there and let Gordon do all the explaining. Fantastic man.
Watching this man explain these things is the best part of this video! He is so excited to educate people on what he does! That’s passion and it’s hard to find these days! Good for him! 😊
can we have him doing press runs instead of Neil deGrasse Tyson
Not gonna lie, at 7:20 I thought the guy was wearing some wizard outfit and I wasn't even shocked.
This was really good! I don’t have much else to say. Thanks for taking the time to share something that seems trivial on the surface, but is actually complex and deeply fascinating. It’s amazing; the science and technology that goes into something which seems so mundane as measuring force.
A milligram is one thousandth of a gram, not one millionth.
The next time someone points a laser at me I'm pressing assault charges.
This video was absolutely excellent.  This guy would be a fantastic guest on Star Talk.
This makes me wonder about how much force the death star would have punched out when it fired.
this guy is awesome
That dude was awesome
I love this guy so much
He definetly passed the vibe check
That compliant mechanism at around 11mins literally just blew my mind
I thought the deepest reference unit was based on the speed of light
The good doctor subdivides some serious Adderall.
So cool..
I really loved the enthusiasm of the man. Great video Derek!
Desperately needs an eli5. For instance, what's a capacitor?
secret thumbnail change
Hard to look at the expert guy and not wonder how much he weighs.
12:18 wHAt Was the balloooooon for!!!!!
I liked this video, especially the professor was amazing. However I feel like this video wasn't as much "to the point", the ending felt rather abrupt in my opinion and I haven't quite made the connection on how this is actually applied. I can't really imagine how measuring tiny forces allows us to analyze exhaust gasses for example, but I'd really really like to know
Me, a drug connoisseur, already knowing about micrograms 😳😂
I love to see the enthusiasm that he speaks with about his work. Very encouraging.
my girlfriend at 10:05
Wow that explains why people run when I chase them with my flashlight the light is actually pushing them
Comic book store owner Santa is pretty cool.
legend knows this is third thumbnail
This is so awesome.  I didn't expect to hear the suffix "ish" a few times though! 😅
Great video! He was very knowledgeable and explained the concepts very well! I love the physics and engineering in this one.
You could tell that this was only a tiny part of what he wanted to share.
Doesn't gravity fluctuate slightly depending on where you are on earth? If so,  weighing the reference weights can be off?
Love how passionate this guy is about his job and his important work. As a former metrologist, its incredible the reach this guys work has - and he barely scratched the surface in his description of why its important. My job was inspecting airfoils in jet turbine engines. All our gages and measurement tools had to be traced to NIST. Every industry depends on their standards to verify measurements. Without them, we don't know who is right or wrong. Who is short changing us. Or if engineering design intent is met in a manufactured good. I am glad guys like him exist and that he obviously is so passionate about the work that he does. Kudo's to Veritasium for not only sharing the story of an unsung hero, but showing his importance in our world.
What a wonderfully engaging nerd!!! <3
I have absolutly no interest in precision measurement but still watched this entire video  Thats a hell of a good job
What I love about Veritasium is to watch CR7 teaching us "some" Science.
yo the thumbnail changed
That dude is a professional
Am I the only person wondering why the balloon on the table is precisely the same shade of orange as the hard hat?
I honestly wouldn’t mind doing this for work, I just wonder how much those guys get paid
I love him, it's always great to see an absolute genius talk about something
That nano wire looks like the wire burr I get from a really great edge sharpening a plane blade. Much finer than a hair..
So obnoxious to be pointing a video camera in someone's face when you're the one interviewing them, and you've even got someone else there filming too 🤦 I'm a videographer and have done lots of vlogging and I can still say these are not the right situations to be pointing a camera in their face
no its not stupid
Big fan of Dr. Gordon Shaw!
Autos built in $MM and houses built in " ' & $
How much is the France 1kg is weighting nowadays with the new system
Wiw
He seemed so excited to share all his knowledge! Delightful!
Before you judge somebody who doesn't use the metric system... You should walk 1.609344 kilometers in their shoes.
Not a minute in the video and I already agree
I quite love how a man who deals with such precise measures uses "ish" so often lol
What sucks is the miss-application of precision on systems that can't benefit from precision.
This is hands down one of the best videos I’ve ever seen. Been here since we found out how trees can grow so tall…
😳 Mind Blown.
F those commie units. The smallest weight anyone ever need is a pennyweight and 'Merica went to the moon while commies are still eating potatos
Imma firin ma lazer
bros got a hard hat on incase 10 micro grams falls on him
Take a laser pointer and shine it on the end of your finger. Can you feel the force from it? No? That guy can measure it.
This guy loves what he does and it’s great to see
Good place to test the EM drive
I love to watch these absolute geniuses that Derek and Destin find and allow to explain their craft.
Wow I just realized that the Veritasium periodic table logo thing has a 42.0 at the bottom
this guy changed the thumbnail AND the title in 10 hours
Great video and your interview with him makes me feel the science of meauring is in the right hands.
Is this all translatable on a planet with less gravity?
This man is incredible and absolutely love his enthusiasm for it all!
You know how there are no stupid questions?….Not a physics guy by any stretch of the imagination, but light could carry mass that is equal to it’s force, would that cause an opposite but equal reaction and thus allow mass to travel as well as the speed of light (in a vacuum) in the opposite direction.  Which would result in mass traveling at the speed of light?
I would love to see a conversation between that man and Destin from Smarter Every Day's dad.
Metrology is so cool! I'm amazed you found someone so enthusiastic and personable to show you some stuff that is so amazing and who is very able to bring it down to a normal person's level of understanding! I can do measurements down to 0.0001 inch (ouch, I know), but this stuff blows my mind!!! Great one!
Since the kibble is the standard should the smaller one be called bits
Mandela affect is changing the mass of the weights over time .
A soul is 21grms
This guy was fantastic! He was so excited that someone was taking a genuine interest in his life's work. Hats off to Dr. Gordon, science is always so much more fun when you can tell that the person is genuinely excited and passionate about the subject matter.
This is one very interesting video.
You should have asked him have you ever dropped or knocked the boxes 😂
“Yes, it’s stupid” I love the bluntness of scientists.
Dr. Shaw was a blast to listen to!
I have on occasion wondered what would be the result of just adding three orders of magnitude to our ability to measure values and machine parts among other things. It would probably revolutionize civilization and spring us forward in a huge way.
"You know"
He sounds like a really smart Seth Rogen
0:46 freedom units ahahahah
I love Dr. Shaw's clearly deep passion for and knowledge of his work.  A true educator.  Thanks for sharing.
Destin's father would love this video
I love this video so much more than I expected! Keep it up Derek!
The expert was amazing, but as usual you make too many mistakes for me to be able to enjoy the video.  Since you're not able to speak correctly about science, maybe you could hire someone with knowledge of science to read your scripts before you embarrass yourself and confuse your target audience?
This guy is amazing. I love that man.
This was one of my favourite episodes because of Dr Shaw, it's one thing explaining a science, it's another to do it with passion and truly enjoy educating people on a subject.
Gordon is awesome
What a fantastic interviewee
Ah, Metrology, and NIST.  Thanks a Ton, y'all.
People in the US don't use the metric system because it is way too difficult...to multiply and divide by 10.
I once made a potato clock all by myself.
I remember back in 2018 Klaus von Klizing, the German Nobelist known for integer quantum Hall effect, came to our university (SUT) explaining change in the definition of the mass standard based on Plank’s constant. He also brought the gold Nobel medal with him to the auditorium! Crowd went wild…😄
so if lasers/light create force we can use it to propel us into space finally. light speed almost achieved LOOOL
the guy was so happy and excited explaining his jpb what a happy man :)
All this work for the Americans use the dumb system
I love and admire both Derek and Dr Shaw's enthusiasm and passion
As someone who worked as a measurement engineer and in research for over a decade.. Developing systems of measurement that are accurate, repeatable and reliable isn't trivial.  Reference testing is a constant.
The US is actually mutli-measurable while Europe is multilingual. Funny how Euros just can't understand
Very cool!!
They measured how light light is.
Well done to Derek for just silently letting him explain everything. Something which too few people are willing/able to do
that's the heavy stainless steel wire... all the rest of the video the man makes sense... that little piece of stainless steel wire, unless attached to something I don't see... cannot possibly weigh 500gm... I watched the rest... came back and looked again... could you please explain that to me ❓ 🙏 ❤️🙏
Where is the QCM-D?
In the age of entertainment, who will do these jobs?
That guy really loves his job, you can see it when he talks
That was awesome I can see so many applications beside the ones he listed.
This is very cool
So what does it mean if you can feel a laser pointer or even light from a strong flashlight on your skin? Blindfolded… (Other than you should duck… 🤣)
This guy was soooo excited to finally tell someone about this that was so deeply interested! lol, I can imagine him telling family at thanksgiving about piconewtons and they are like wut??
i’m not really interested in precision measurement but wow that guy had me hooked the whole video lol
00:47 had me. lmao🤣
Loved the video. Thank you for what you do.
A kilogram weighs more in Iceland than it does in Venezuela.
Watching this man explain these things is the best part of this video! He is so excited to educate people on what he does! That’s passion and it’s hard to find these days! Good for him! 😊
Photon drive?
This fentogram guy is awesome!
– Doesn't that seem crazy?  – Yes, it's stupid.
Very interesting. I'd guess that sneezing in this room could be a problem. Imagine dropping one of the smallest and trying to find it on the floor!  "No, that's a mouse hair. Keep looking".
What an amazing video XD. I love how passionate Dr Shaw is! Thanks for the content and also to him for the great explanations :3
you change the thumbnail?
If you're measuring the pushing force of a laser by observing the oscillatory effect it has on some apparatus, how do you make the measurement of the oscillation without disturbing the measurement further? Wouldn't the photons you use to make the measurement of the change in oscillation period/frequency also create a force which would contaminate the measurement? Would it simply be that the effect of the measuring photons is so small in comparison to the effect of the laser's photons that it can be ignored?
No, the US is not metric because the regular people in the US do not use the metric system, as those regular people want to instead be stupid.
The title, along with the previous thumbnail, made me lol.
haha, what a proper nerd. I want to know more!
Hi Derk!
10:05 why he calling me out like that
I love when people have a real passion for what they’re doing. I could listen to that guy for houres
Can I give you a bit of feedback?  It took 12min into the video to finally discover what the applications of the measurements are.  Watching the video before this section was kind of boring, not understanding what the point of it all was.
My cat proves you underestimate the force of a laser pointer.
Damn it I thought YouTube sponsorships were a waste of time but here I am debating getting brilliant
Talk about splitting hairs!
Beautiful
That's really cool :)
Veritasium is filling the void in my heart that Vsauce left
Ok so i should believe it
Which NIST site were you at here? Boulder?
That man is the Jon Favreau of science
It's so crazy this started with SALT and Water blurs all up for data. Just a drop and everything is off Mechanically, Weight Wise, and Electrically. Have you ever seen video of a piece of straw pierce through a piece of wood... just because a tornado?
Ok tbh this is cool.
For someone who's job it is to measure and be very precise, he sure does say ish alot.
We do t appreciate what goes on in everyday work places... calibrating things so the world works well without too much human interventions.
I really want to watch Smarter Every Day’s dad watch this and comment on how it’s impacted his work as a metrologist.
I relate to this guys enthusiasm sooooo much.
Killin it Derek. Love the frequency of new vids
Dr. Gordon Shaw is such a wonderful guy, so enthusiastic, watching this was wonderful.
This is my favorite person interviewed, so happy to take about science,, like truly giddy.  And the subject is fascinating too
you gotta change this thumbnail i was so confused looking at it
cool dude
I'm a statistician. Videos like this hit me on a new level.
More of Gordon please
This really illustrates why precision calibrated equipment is so expensive. It might not be that the device itself is that complex but the verification of its accuracy requires a whole complex industry of exactness.
It would be so cool to have a video sometime about optical tweezers. The part about atomic force microscopy reminded me of that. There are a surprising number of ways to measure forces that small.
Waving a balloon while talking???
Booo... didn't actually measure a laser pointer!  I wonder what some of the smallest forces actually are. Like would the impact of a neutron from a fission be one? It has super tiny mass but it is traveling pretty fast after the fission. Or the impact of a single photon... Do we even have the ability to control the emission of a single photon?
Is the paperclip used as a reference weight for 1 gram?
This guy IS SO EXCITED ABOUT HOW AMAZING ALL THIS IS - he was a delight to hear :D  Fascinating video! Enhanced by a fellow who knows how cool his work is!
He sounds like Boris Johnson 🤣
0:59
This is why I love these videos. Taking a look into the world that real scientists live in, watching them doing important work, AND they love their job and the science behind it.. Gordon looked like he had so much fun, and he clearly loves sharing his experience.
What about interferometers ? There are only so many wavelengths.
Dr. Gordon was fantastic!
Ever since your YouTube algorithm video I try to predict how the thumbnail will change. You start off with a fancy “sciency” one to get the big brains going, then get more clickbaity to farm the long haul. Maybe this one can be a guy getting hit in the eye with a laser? We’ll wait and see!
Absolutely fascinating. His enthusiasm and knowledge is very inspiring.
I wonder how much the gravitational force changes due to our planet's interior shifting around.
Measuring forces at femtonewton level in a country where its citizens don't even use kilograms
My total respect , it's amazing
How does the measurement of the femto Newton work exactly? If you're measuring the displacement with an interferometer and photon pressure is enough to cause a displacement, won't the act of measuring the displacement (with a laser) invalidate the result you're actually trying to measure?
Is it me or should you be talking about how precisely these things are measured, not accurately.
Once again man you make literally the most interesting videos on YouTube!
"Choose a job you love and you'll never have to work a day in your life"  I think that man doesn't work anymore!
Now what I'm asking myself is: how the f do they accurately make these tiny forms - like the silica parallelogram
freedom units LOL 🤣🤣🤣🤣
If you were to tell me there's a video on weighing things or say standards sitting in a warehouse, I'd probably fall asleep mid sentence. But YOU have exposed how absolutely fascinating this is, edging up to physical possibilities and the math behind how we overcome this. Incredibly fascinating, thanks for enriching my life with these.  Weighing things = not boring, pushing the thresholds of science.
this dude knows about microgram doses
freedom units hahahahaha
I just like that one day someone thought “hmm I wonder how small I can measure” and now we’re here
No mention of the Smithereen? And you call yourself a scientist...
I’m heading to NIST right now. I want to see if my dealer is giving me the right weight.
I like that guy.
Destin's father might find that place a paradise.
This guy is absolutely nerding out and I am loving every second of it
My main Question stays unanswered:  Why were the Platin–iridium Kilograms losing / gaining Mass?
i want to hang out and learn from this passionate weight-comparing professional.
It boggles my mind that the US still hasn't gone metric on the user side. It is objectively better on every level.
This was such an interesting video! Thanks so much for sharing.
Penn’s science loving cousin?
Wow! Just wow.
Can you ask Dr shaw please make a channel about measurements!
Dr. Gordons excitement in the science makes me so happy
We all know the biggest Force in the universe is an energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us and penetrates us; it binds the galaxy together. It's what gives the Jedi his power.
To add an extra point on the "stretching DNA" statement: in the lab, we use a technique called optical tweezer which is exactly what Dr Shaw said, using photons to move a bead that is tethered to a DNA strand or even protein. This allows us to have an extremely precise amount of force at the level of picoNewton that can stretch DNA or proteins out. We use this technique to understand the mechanical properties of biomolecules, as well as the spatial organisation of them. This is important because many diseases change protein and DNA's organisation and properties. Super cool.
SEE? LIGHT HAS MASS, IT CAN MOVE THINGS, ITS FORCE CAN BE MEASURED. MASS.
So, when someone says that an electrons weighs about 9.11×10^-31 kg, how certain are we?
This man is so excited for this, he is just incredibly happy over these weights.
I honestly wouldn't mind if the US were to transition to metric in daily life (science has always been metric, of course)... if and only if we standardize HOW to write metric numbers. Some metric countries write "1.234.567,89" (wrong), some metric countries and all imperial countries write "1,234,567.89" (the right way). This should have been the *_one thing_* we enforced a universal standard on since day one. Commas for Thousands, Periods for Decimals. Get it standard, get it universal, maybe then Amerika might be willing to go metric in daily life. Otherwise you have three-orders-of-magnitude errors that crash rovers into planets even if everyone knew they were using metric units.
M×v=f so light is proven 2 have mass
What I wouldn't give for a tour of NIST with this guy.
Metrology is dark arts
Imagine if all teachers were somehow as engaging and excited as this guy!
0:47, as hydrogen fuel power gets more popular, we will see the kilogram more. Unless a company programs its hydrogen pumps in pounds (lbs)...
I'm only 2 minutes in but do they all have these weights at the same altitude?
well done for letting him speak with detail
i want to speak like this scientist . Very well spoken with good energy
american using the metric system "doesn't that seem crazy???" and then the person there replies, _very_ matter-of-factly, "yes, it's stupid." i love this so much
orange hat describes measuring by using a fancy doorbell
that was fun. i liked how charmingly enthusiastic this guy described his fine equipment just to finish it up with saying he could measure "about" a Femtonewton
ACAB includes NIST
Thanks
I’m a metrology engineering technician. I deal with some of this stuff but not at this extremely small scale. And yes - it is a pain in the ass to ensure calibration down to such a small percent. That’s why they pay me the big bucks.
That guy was fantastic.
Imagine getting your pants in a tizzy that some people out there use different units. There are people out there who call fireflies "lightning bugs" too. Not everyone chooses to be a pretentious asshole about it. Pick a different hill do die on; this one is far too cliche.
Which kind of force does the laser apply on the metal and why?
Now that the channel has grown bigger, please, tell me what song is it at time 12:21. Thank you!
This is pretty interesting as a mechanical engineering student, because we will learn a bit about this in our third year, on engineering measurement subject.
It's so good to watch someone that absolutely loves his job explaining it to someone else <3
I don't know what I like more, the metric system or red velvet cake.  Some people say they don't want to use the metric system because they don't want to go back and forth between different units.  They don't get it.  You just go "forth" and stop going back. I'm in the U.S. and use metric whenever possible.  Now and then I have to convert FROM the silly units, but I pretty much never have any reason to convert TO them.  It's SO much simpler (well, at least twenty-seven thirty-fifths of the time it is.)
MORE DOC GORDIE
More videos with Gordon pleas.
I want another video with this man, I don't know about what but it needs to be done.
this guy has the coolest job in the world haha, so much fun learning that
10:47 Ah yes, stretching out a DNA molecule. As one does...
Metrology is a fascinating field. I work as a surveyor and get exposed to some brilliant stuff. One of my co-workers is an expert in the field of very accurate measurements of very large objects. Think microns on a hydroelectric impeller. It's fascinating stuff and the NIST guy in the videos level of enthusiasm is common in the field and contagious
I love the metrology part of my job
All rooms should be kept at a constant 20°C.
using dumb analogies like stretching DNA really helps cement how stupidly hard this is :D
Veritasium you of all people should know the difference between weight and mass
I thought the kilogram was now based on a mathematical concept and they had done away with the replicas.
love watching people be genuinely excited about their job this much! great video again
I wonder at what point gravity of different objects in the room throw off measurements, for example two 1 kilogram masses a metre apart are attracting each other with 67 piconewtons so at that point getting too close to the scales or having a large metal object near them would throw off readings.
Dude you've done this video before
Loved it!
I'm gonna make a tall claim here: There is no force-sensor. All sensors that claim to be force-sensors are, in reality, some form of displacement (or strain) sensors, or are counteractive precise actuators. The "force" is then only indirectly estimated. The stiffness of your cantilever, the d_33 of your piezo-crystal, the gage-factor of your strain-gage  or the transduction-constant of your kibble balance then is a "necessary evil" that must be an intermediary for _any_ force -measurement- estimation.
wow
Totally thought i had a piece of hair on my phone lol
what a man, made the video easy for derek i guess 😁 star of the show
This man is a mad wizard and I love it.
The "big question" is at 12:15 "Why does anyone need to measure forces this small?" Definitely the same question I was asking myself throughout this video. Interesting answer!! Thanks, Veritasium, for a fascinating look into an area of science that most people would never otherwise begin to understand...
measurement technology is so cool
This guy is awesome! And he made everything easy to understand! And he’s so enthusiastic it’s so awesome to listen to him explain everything.
Do cats know of the kibble balance?
nobody eats away his joghurt - he knows exactly how much was in there
So cool….
love this guy
The tiniest force in the universe aka the blood pressure it requires for me to attain erect status
Were you in Boulder CO Derek?
“Wittle”
Dr. Gordon interviewed extremely well. Very knowledgeable and excited about what he does. This was an excellent video.
This man is amazing
So, if I am understanding correctly.  You could use the silica scale (balance thing) apply a known set of atoms to the surface, and measure the difference is frequency, to measure the individual weight of atoms, yes?
I love this man, amazing energy incredible explanations
Nice, using the Laowa lens.  I absolutely love their macro lenses.
Talking about the imperial system: “Yes it’s stupid” Me: Immediately goes to the comments and see that there’s basically no fighting and feels like there is hope in this world. 😊
Derek, will you be covering the recent breakthrough of a holographic wormhole simulated on a quantum computer? If anyone could distill such a complex topic down into a video that makes the experiment understandable, and highlight the significance of the discovery, it would be you!
So so cool, amazing!!!!
Good guy, more of these videos
I remember the video Derek did some time a go about an ULTRA SMOOTH PURE SILICONE sphere (and we're talking ULTRA ULTRA ULTRA smoooooth lol) and he mentioned that it was potentially going to be used as a tool to define what a TRUE KG was by way of the construction and molecule make up of this particular sphere... 🤔😏 Another great video by the way     😎🇬🇧
Gordon doesn't need to hear all this, he's a highly trained professional!
dope
Haha - the guy slightly panicked when Derek wanted to touch the weights without tweezers. And he has a good reason for that: At the beginning of my Physics study we weighed masses in the lab with different methods - one was using the swinging of a beam balances pointer ( forgot the details ... ). One could clearly see that they became heavier when we touched them with our bare hands.
Very interesting! Aren't the Ligo and Virgo detectors also kinda measuring tiny forces? I wish I had money for Brilliant...
I love to watch people who are completely enraptured by their subject matter explain it to others.
I prefer the term *watt balance,* as I hate naming devices after last names. You name theorems and such after last names of the peeps, not the device
The science guy looks just like Jon Favreau, but with white hair and bigger (Aka "Happy" from spider man, aka Harold Hogan)
9:56 if I saw these small little flakes in a box like this, I would just assume to put them in my mouth and chew. Don't ask me why, but that's what I would do without knowing what they really are. Yes, I know I'm the reason why they put warnings on everything. And I apologize formally.
Metrology Monday
Dr. Gordon Shaw seriously needs his own YouTube channel! I can listen to him for hours!!
I want to have a beer with this guy haha
Question, would it have any effect on accuracy of the measurements from the force of light on the object? Or is this included in the uncertainty
i just love the enthusiasm this guy has, amazing stuff as always
I love that it sounds like he’s saying wittle every time he’s talking about the small weights.
"secretly metric" The real secret is that the US only using imperial units is a myth that Europeans propagate to foster a misguided sense of superiority. We use each system where they're more suitable.
00:46 - "DOESN'T THIS SEEM CRAAAAZY?!?!?!" - HELL FRIGGIN YES!!! WHEN... In 1999, after nigh on 10 months sailing it's way to Mars, the 'Mars Climate Orbiter' broke up and burned into pieces because some COMPLETE DINGUS USED IMPERIAL measurements while building/programming said space craft WHEN IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN METRIC UNITS!! COSTING>>>> $125 MILLION !!!! Or the Boeing 767 passenger plane that was fueled with HALF the fuel it needed for its LONG flight because some COMPLETE NUMPTY loaded it with 22,300 Lbs of fuel INSTEAD of 22,300 Kg of fuel!! Luckily NO-ONE was seriously hurt on that flight EVEN THOUGH the aircraft was GLIDING it's last 100Kilometres of flight to the runway!!!!!! So... COME ON... WAKE UP!!!
mentally exploded for not using safety goggles for picking up weight
I love this guy! He’s so excited to explain and share what he knows :)
He's so excited. But then again metrology is sometimes a neglected branch knowledge in mechanical engineering. So probably he's really happy to know someone is interested in this
This is how silly emission laws have got in cars, needing to measure piconewtons in exhaust particles.
Really enjoy passionate, knowledgeable and articulate guests. What a great interview and video.
Why do we sometimes do science that seems unimportant? It’s the magic down the track that someone else comes up with from your hard work.
Well done
Thank you for sharing these images!
e
Still this commercials going on couple of times in the videos, even if you are still promoting a sponsor... Very annoying. Anyway, quite interesting videos, you should name this series of videos "hidden science" for it's importance in the industrial world
Dr Shaw obviously likes his dinners, is not keen on getting his hair cut and can measure the force required to unravel a DNA molecule. What an absolute top bloke!
This vid went by so quick I couldn't believe it was over! I love that guy.
That kind of precision is mind boggling. I would love to talk with that guy for hours. The knowledge he has and his excitement when talking about it is infectious.... About the force of stretching DNA... That's crazy.
It takes a big man to weigh little things
Make a biology videos please
This is miles better that the "mythbusters" pennies-from-a-helicopter video.
I absolutely love this guy and really want to see a entire documentary about this… Any shot of a further in depth view?
Wow!
Could you do a q&a with that chap he's great!
Quelle passion communicative ce professeur Gordon ! Merci à lui pour ce moment de partage.
This man’s passion tho 🔥
Thit man has passion about his work. Very nice to listen to him.
NIST is an amazing agency doing stuff that nobody knows. Did you know that NIST has world experts on cement/concrete?  They were intimately involved in studying the world trade center buildings after the collapse.
Seeing these things it baffles me as to why there is so much anti-science sentiment.  You don't have to understand the physics of it to understand that it's just awesome.
Now, I know. :)
"Freedom units"... I died 🤣🤣
No, the rest of the world secretly uses freedom units. They just use a little conversion method to get to metric.
Another INCREDIBLE video!... And the passion shown by this guy is AMAZING!
That’s gotta be one the most fascinated videos I’ve seen in a while! Great content like always. Keep it up 🎊
Very interesting... The NIST Tech sure knows his stuff
1:05 there is NOTHING stupid about setting US units in reference to Metric. NOT setting them in relation to a common standard would be stupid. It better standardizes the units of measure, even if they are different than metric. those units are older than metric, and therefore will continue to exist due to history, and therefore there is Nothing wrong with helping standardize them. Many other units of measure other than Metric and English still exist to this day. no one criticizes those units for continuing to exist.   people that don't get this are ignorant of reality and fundamental aspects of science.  And no, all the ignorant Europeans and such claiming the US is not on the Metric system are bold faced liars and they need to be corrected and stopped from spreading lies.
I wish Dr. Gordon Shaw woluld be my dad. It would be so nice to learn from him - I am pretty sure he is a super cool guy
that guy really loves his job... and I understand why :)
I wanted more... More time of this guy explaining his job. He's awesome!
People like Gordon makes the world a better place. Kudos for finding him and making yet another amazing video 🤩
@aVe them metric conspiracies and no MORE!
Very interesting !
7:52 - Right, we are measuring in a vacuum to avoid air currents and the gravitational constant is 9.801 m/s "ish".  🤣🤣
i know some people so sensitive that they can feel 7 piconewtons on their skin
Really curious how intermolecular forces play a role in these measurements and how they are justified
*When your cool Uncle is also a mad scientist:*
5:00 The reason the weights change is due to acidity of the air, where oxygen can actually oxidize the weights and with that add weight. I'd use platinum or gold for those weights, less chance of random weight addition. You may have noticed they all become greater, instead of some losing weight and some getting greater weight. For the gold or platinum weight's I'd use the gram rather than kilogram.
Derek - They recently were able to break the record for the coldest recorded temperature.  Just 38 trillionths of a degree above absolute zero. I've always been curious on how they measure something that cold, and how they managed to get that cold. Might be a good video concept for the future if you're looking for ideas.  Love your content. Best wishes.
I could listen to that Scientist at NIST 24/7. So fascinating and his excitement really made it very easy to listen to him. His force measurements of laser beams was FASCINATING!!
What an insane guy, insane institution, insane video.
Oh my God, I wish my high school teachers were this enthusiastic about giving their lessons. I could have actually enjoy all those boring years.
Shouldn't the weight of a standard mass change due to the position of the moon, as well? The moon exerts about GM/r^2 = 3e-5 N/kg = ~0.3 ppm which is large compared to 0.000001%.
this dude is awesome, and so excited about anything
SU. PER. COOL! Thanks for the info!
why were the masses diverging ? Thats interesting?
Great video.
Since we are yet to measure the speed of light in one direction, does that mean the kilo gram is not accurate as well!!?
another Veritasium W
Wait, you're telling me that the plague of PM2.5 particles from diesel exhaust is the result of this lab being able to measure things super accurately? There's something extremely unsatisfying about that.
What does he mean by the amount of energy it takes to “stretch out a DNA molecule”? That seems like a widely variable value to me. Do I misunderstand?
I cave calibration masses thate are bent wires. I just learned that the numbers of bends corresponds to the weight.
Really cool video. Showing the tedious process of getting and keeping those references.
12:09 There's a small caveat to the force measuring of the laser pointer. It doesn't actually measure photonic impact pressure, but pressure differences due to heat absorption of the reflection, mostly. In order to measure true photonic pressure only, the measurement must be done in a vacuum, to avoid pressure differences, due to local heating of atmosphere, by the heat absorption of the laserlight.
I like the video "roundes objekt in the world" more. given the fact, that is the most precise kilogram
Please keep showing scientists in their fields because young people need to know you can be a nerd for a living
LOVED THIS DUDE. This type of guy that is just so invested wholly into his work and excited about what he works on is EXACTLY the kinda guy I wanna work with. Wish I could watch an entire series of stuff he works on.
Love this video, one of my favourite topics!
Hearing his call pounds “freedom units” brought be more joy than it should have
For a guy who specializes in precision the word "ish" is used quite a few times during this interview 😂 One could also argue that these are real life measurements and will never match their theoretical references. So approximations and use of words like "ish" and "about" are probably quite correct in that sense. Great video!
11:34 bro's measuring radiation pressure. This is so useful for space travel...
Metrology is particularly interesting to me.  I could watch stuff like this for days and never lose interest.  So feel free to do a 200-hour episode (or two or three)!  🙂
Great video. Always love showing your "US is on the Metric Scale" clip to anyone who cares. You missed an opportunity to try and get Mitutoyo to sponsor a video! Coulda haggled for some precision calipers! 😆
The force is strong with this one.
Great explanation
I thought they would only be called test weights or test masses if those haven't been calibrated yet. By calibration I mean those test weights or masses haven't been compared yet to a known standard.
I wonder how the guy in the purple shirt weighs himself, I guess with an elephant on the other side of the scale.
Awesome video. Thank you
8:12 Not to put a dent in their measuring scheme, but did they take into account that the gravity changes over time, with planets and the Moon ? Also, the distance and side towards the Sun also makes a change.
I love this guys enthusiasm
Why is it labelled "freedom units" when its a revenue of the exact opposite when sieged by foreign powers? or is some reversed , where people simply cant comprehend it themself... like you also see with fx antifa.. that claims they are anti f.. while they are in fact the pedicle of f....and runs around targeting anybody that ain't loyal, and dared to form an opinion of their own, even on street cafe's  and if anybody don't show submission & loyalty and bow on a knee,, they will be targeted by the mobs and don't care its a family with kids etc. but solely the "anti" in the naming makes certain people, lack common sense. why are imperial called freedom units in USA, when its a leftover from a foreign powered that sieged and did horrors to US? same with the 3 other places where imperial are, all sieged imperial regions.   the Mililitary dictatorship in Burma (Myanmar) Liberia in Africa and USA.. are the 3 places that still used this old imperial standards that all is based and defined in metric, just with an added conversation on top. all 3 new nations that previously were sieged by foreign powers from another world region.
Great visit.  My grandson needs to watch this!  Thanks also to Dr Shaw for sharing his enthusiasm.
if dust was that big of a problem why aren't you gowned up?
How much is 20 degrees Celsius in “freedom units” because I genuinely don’t know what 20 degrees feels like in Celsius
12:15 Asking a big question while being surrounded by tiny objects 😝.
Working in physics and chemistry labs, precise measurement calibration is so important.
0:50 "Freedom units".  Ahem... British Imperial units (for mass).  :)
Such a great professor! :D Thank you for sharing the knowledge!
Incredible flutter in the laugh fade-out at 1:00
444NNNth now 453NNNth* viewer
That 10 microgram weight reminded me of that guy who did sculptures inside of needle eyes. Pretty sure he mentioned that he 1. Has to work between heartbeats and 2. Has inhaled one of his creations by accident at least once.
honestly tickled me something serious to know you guys are actually having to fabricate your loyalty to freedom units haha
If these two are this excited working, I wouldn't mind working with them.
Hello Derek,  I don't think I've ever stated this, but I really appreciate all the videos you take the time to make. Thank you for making them.
very likeable guy
I just found one of the coolest guys in the world! I wish he had a channel and talked 24 hours a day! (The grey hair grey beard dude.)
Dr. Shaw hit the nail on the head at the end there. So many incredibly important scientific advancements can be directly traced to better and better precision of measurements, from mass to time.
It's wild to me how different measurement as a problem is at different scales. We can very easily measure to within 0.1 gram just with a household kitchen scale, but beyond that, precision gets exponentially more expensive.
6:29 OK, everything's great, but why suddenly the orange helmet? 😂
I love this man ! Thanks for the video
Gravitational waves measurement would not be possible without techniques to detect extremely small differences in distances much like the instrument shown at the end of the video.
For a lab that deals with such precise measurements, this guy’s frequent use of “ish” as a measurement is kinda funny. “The acceleration of gravity is 9.801… ish” lol Don’t get me wrong, I genuinely find that funny in a fun way, not being negative at all. It’d be boring to listen to all the decimals if he were to be precise.
if planck's constant is measured in joule seconds, and joule seconds are kg*m^2*s^-1 isn't that defining a kilogram with a kilogram?
When he described being able to measure a piconewton and a femtonewton, my brain exploded.
This is exact-ish
I took a couple of things from this. 1) How excited he is to talk about his research and knowledge. 2) How often he adds "-ish" to describe the accuracy of something - somewhat ironic for a guy that deals with the accuracy of weights.
Always a pleasure listening someone passionate about knowledge and applications. A big hug and a beer for Dr. Shaw!
I liked this dude
E
Was a  pleasure to listen to this guy. You can see his excitement in his eyes when he answeres these questions.
ah yes, plonck's constant, my favourite
It’s ironic that a man so concerned with tiny masses is so unconcerned with his own unhealthily large mass.
Thanks Derek for bringing us to some of the neatest places in the world.
I love energy of this man! Great video
this might be a dumb question but, are they measuring the weight of individual iron particles and then calculating how many particles are in each piece to get a total weight?  edit: also could some of those scales be photosensitive? 11:35 that answers my question hahaha
exactly one minute in and he is already my hero of the video!
i just bought a scale that can measure to 0.01g and i thought that was pretty accurate...until i saw this video
The US has been metric since about 1890.  Just commerce and people are obstinate about using silly units.
Glad he picked up the 1g paperclip only with the pair of tweezers. Wouldn’t risk any fingerprints on this one.
I still don't know how to actually measure it.
10:39 That's a new word I never heard.
"yes its stupid" exactly, get with metric folks !
This dude really gives of Penn Jillette vibes. Love it.
1/c seconds obviously
очень круто! спасибо вам за вашу работу)
This man had Trust issues with his dealer.
I hope Dr Shaw knows how much we all love his explanations and passion for his work
This man was so interesting to listen!
this guy is the definition of "If you love what you do, you'll never work a day in your life"
What portable camera were you using?
Bro how do they measure DNA????
Are just supposed to ignore the 12:14 orange sausage balloon? What happened there?! We need answers!
I don't think I love anything as much as that guy loves his work
That's so cool, I've never thought about measurements so light, I love the concept of the scale, and the researcher did so well explaining everything
This guy in the lab is truly setting a standard of what a scientist should be and sound like. It would be amazing to learn directly from him in a class and enjoy hours of knowledge feeding.
One very useful application of these tiny precision measurements is to test how gravity works on the very small scale. (quantum gravity)
"Freedom units"
I should have started counting how many times "Big K" is brought up on this channel in the last ten years
This is why humans are out of touch with reality. We have more reality to deal with now
Where do the store their standard VOLT so they can calibrate the electrical charge on the capacitor?
this guy from NIST is so cool! what a great guy
For a few years now whenever I hear someone saying how awesome imperial is because it "makes more sense" or "it sent a man to the moon"....... I'm *that guy* who points out  "you're not using our *british imperial freedom units* anymore, America uses metric and then applies a conversion afterwards so you don't actually measure anything in feet". Nice to hear it pretty much verbatim from someone else.
Everything is fascinating if you push it to the nth degree.
So Tractor Beam is REAL.
The most under-stated moment in this excellent interview occurs at 11:55, when in the context of measuring light pressure, Derek tries to make the topic more accessible to viewers by asking, "So you're saying you could measure the force of a laser pointer?", and the technician responds, "Oh, yeah, that's roughly 7 pico-newtons, which again, is enough to stretch out a DNA molecule." By which, the technician means that laser pointers are actually several thousand times stronger than the femtonewton forces he's measuring. Quite an insightful interview with a depth expert on taking empirical measurement to new heights of precision. That guy clearly knows his stuff!
The problem with government bureaucracy is it makes someone wear a stupid little plastic helmet that will do nothing among these large machines just because of rules and the appearance of safety.
That guy is a natural on camera and seems to have that contagious enthusiasm thing going on!! This was a cool video! 👍
I'm surprised that wasn't a cleanroom and they weren't fully kitted out in cleanroom suits. With the kind of accuracy they are talking about, breathing on a sample or a stray skin flake would have messed everything up (I would have thought).
A few points:  NIST owns an absolute gravimeter - why didn't they show it to Veritasium? USGS is not the official gravity reference agency in the US. NGS is. Why the discrepancy? NIST, being an NMI, should be using its own gravimeter according to international standards. Why did Mr. Shaw NOT wear a hairnet in the labs as well as Veritasium's host? Especially since it was mentioned that dust can wreak havoc on the weight measurements. Where was the super-conduction gravimeter? Etc...
I found this video very interesting. As an electrician who's done a ton of work in some very high Precision Optics plants, Metrology labs and machine shops it is always blown my mind just how in depth this subject can go
"Yeah, it's stupid"  Everyone outside of The USA is with ya, Pal.
"Freedom units" 🤘🏼🇺🇸
Like we really need to know that level of a carbon foot print.  Totally crap and just another over funded project for no technical use....................  You think CHINA cares about a picogram of diesel exhaust?
Metrology is one of the most interesting subjects in my opinion. But the best part of this video is the enthusiasm of the guy. Man he really like his job.
I really want to get drunk with that guy. I just listen to him sound off about femtometer measurements.😂
7:44 that’s a strange place to store your weight 😅
This is a man who knows his subject.   What a nice guy
I've used an electronic balance like the one in the video.
I love how he's a metrologist and he uses the word "ish" so often and he's totally right
Your slight hesitation before saying "freedom units" 🤣
Thank you for placing non-adsense at front/back/both of video rather than interrupting somewhere between, so I can like the video and listen to offer, and otherwise cannot justify either.
Dr. Shaw is amazing. It lets me sleep calm to know that people like him are fueled and can work by their passion :)
that's what she said
Love that guy
This video was great, as always, but *wow*, I would watch an entire series taught by this man. He just so clearly loves what he does, and it’s amazing to listen to him explain things (and it’s making me remember why NIST is on my list of cool organizations :) )
so you went to a place where they measure the tiniest things in the universe to ask a big question 12:13 it is funny
You might be able to fool the rest but there is 0% chance that they just use this technology for automotive particulates, or medical dna stretching. I know a “that is confidential” cut when I see one😂
What? Light (a.k.a. photon particle) don't have any mass.
Almost as accurate as the scale used to weigh the witch, Monty Python and the Holy Grail !
Wow, just amazing.
Honest question: He is showing these tiny weights somehow unprotected. Aren't they afraid that they would go flying just because someone breathed on them?
Poor freedom unit advocates getting shock of a lifetime
Than gentleman LOVES his job and his enthusiasm is infectious.  Nice!
I like that guy, he really looks like he appreciated the chance to show you his workshop.
now i find it even more funny that the us uses imperial 😂
I don't know what it is, but ever since I saw Destin's father measuring the shield for the JWST over on SmarterEveryDay I've just found Metrology so fascinating!
This absolute legend (which that person is) reminds me a bit of Hazel of the Umbrella Academy, all the good characteristics that is.
Something I was hoping to be covered is the fact the planet gains mass constantly, so of course, gravity follows suit. So it stands to reason that something weighing exactly 1kg will no doubt be heavier to the 15 decimal the very next day.
It’s people who are so passionate about their job and speciality that help further our understanding in the area. It’s awe-inspiring watching people like him enjoying his job so much!
Love One Another
Stupid YouTube Ads!
Question then, if the force of a laser can be measured, and I'm pretty sure the light pressure from the Sun is a known quantity, then in theory could you measure the amount of force your Shadow blocks and effectively come up with your shadows weight? It would be a negative number, but it would be calculatable I think.
Thus guy really has a passion for his science
Weigh this, weigh that How about this guy weighs himself for a change
What a cool, interesting, engaging guy. Does anyone else want to know what the orange balloon was doing on his bench?!
How much does a fingerprint weigh?
I love to hear people nerding out on their scientific passion. He definitely could talk about this for daysssss and I love that
Great video, man! Keep those great topics comming in 💪
Genuinely great watching a guy who loves his job talk about his job. Fascinating - thank you!
Super cool stuff!
This was really informing. Also that gentlemen seems like hed be awesome to work with, love his energy for his work.
Tiniest force in the universe is probably a woman's fart, because we all fart, but they claim they don't, so their farts must, logically, be minimal.
Within 6 hours!
This guy loves his work
Absolutely fascinating :-)
We need an extended version of this.
So light has a mass?  My whole education has been a lie.
Neat!
Funny to hear "9.81 meters per second" from someone in this profession.
That's the Question to ask to my Future Wife 😏
6:06 I know that's not a ziptie, but why does it look like a ziptie? 😂
His passion and willingness to share his knowledge and experience is truly inspirational, and definitely something to look up to...
When they use the EFB balance, do they compensate for the gravitational pull from the moon?
The love this guy has for his job almost made me want to work with him measuring the force of lasers
That's very cool and that guy seems like he really enjoys his job.
The famous trick question is which is heavier 1kg of steel or 1kg of feathers? And the answer to normal society is neither. But from this video the uncertainty of a 1 kg of steel is 10 micro grams whereas each feather has a greater uncertainty therefore either the steel or the feather is heavier 🤯
gamer
Passion is contagious
Didn't you already make a video covering all this stuff?
I didn't know  Penn Jillette worked at NIST! What a delightful guy
Still shaking my head that it took me 3 YEARS to hear that they finally changed the mass standard to be based on a physical constant rather than a large piece of jewelry. My wife probably thinks I'm insane based on how excited I was to learn that, lol.
Thanks for putting a description in your description
Is the guy not concerned his hair will end up in a balance?
This is a brilliant demonstration of scientific stupidity. It is unacceptable for the masses to diverge... hm.... maybe we could study is it so instead of pretending it does not happen. Main stream science is so cough in dogmas that is is no longer science. But his-story protection science.
I really liked the scientist. He transimts a lot of joy on his work. Thanks for the video sharing this man!.
This was awesome. Dr. Shaw is incredible get that man his own tv show
This guy is awesome
if making a sample of something that weighs 10μg is so hard, why not make it with the least dense solid there is. big variations in volume result in small variations in mass
The dude’s excitement for the work he does is contagious. I wish I was able to get this excited about my job.
As a physicist and with 15 years out of academic science, I found it very satifying to witness an amount of enthusiasm about a thing that only very few people care about at all, while at the same time that very thing having a huge impact on our real world.
The voice crack @ 1:13 got me 😂
I knew I could see the fleas in the flea circus 🎪
I'm really surprised they're not using gold
This guy is such a natural on camera!
" Yeh it's stupid " 🤣🤣
Who knew America's grandpa was keeping the kilo in line?
Isn't it great we live during an era where we can measure the force required to stretch a DNA strand..
If NIST is cool why can't they tell us the amount of concrete in the Twin Towers and the distribution of steel that held it up.
femtonewtons.. jeeze
Wake up babe new Vertasium video just dropped
please go to other end of the scale. I want to know how they accurately measure thrust on rocket engines and torque on large electric locomotives!
wouldn't the absolute gravitational force in that building need to be remeasured every so often due to the shift of the layers of the earth, and the changing of the orbit of the sun and moon?
I watched a video about someone who is able to make sculptures so tiny that they are smaller than the width of a human hair. This reminds me of how they worked with that 10 micro gram wire.
I love that man's passion, it's so infectious!
I've dealt a few times over the years with the people at NIST, usually trying to find ways to (cheaply) calibrate instruments.  They are some of the most helpful people you'd ever want to meet...or they are bored lonely nerds longing for outside persons to maybe call them someday and ask questions...but I like the first version of that better.
I know what 110ug and 220ug looks like but don't ask me how I know.
This guy is a truly genius, you can know just for the way he talks, thank you
why don't you put the 10 micro grams on a black background
They need to get in touch with the guy that makes those sculptures that fit in the eye of a needle🤣
it is so wonderul to see somebody who loves what they do, and even more so to share it.
This to me relates to the discussion around how SEE's can change our DNA e.g how different forms of electromagnetism can effect the human body, very interesting video!
Came here to comment that I loved this guy's passion and excitement...but found that about a thousand other people beat me to it! 🤣
Ok. You got me at "measuring a Femto Newton". That is badass!
what property of space-time would a universal sensor measure?
This and the heaviest scale video just make me happy.
I wish I had these kinds of fieldtrips at my school. I get to live them with YT. Thank you Derek
I love how you hold camera close your face so when people explain something to you i feel like they talking directly to me through screen. I can feel the excitment and also this chemistry of talking to actual person and not just to camera. Very smart camera work man, love it
I liked it when Derek used to sit and comment at the end of the video before the sponsored part... I miss that in this type of videos!
I’m surprised it’s not a clean room environment to keep skin and hair off the samples.
NIST is one of the coolest places on Earth. Metrology is probably one of the most nerdy pursuits, yet at the same time it is so grounded in the practical world that it is overwhelming with relevance.
12:48 what an awful decision to add the direct laser light in the videos
Man it's kind of crazy that with the lens used to see the 10 microgram weight you could see the individual dots of ink from the printed text.
I thought this was going to be really cool but it was REALLY cooler than I expected. The way that dude talks makes me excited about measuring things. Makes me wonder what the tolerance for weight variation in prescription meds is. Like is my 15 mg pill 15.1234 mgs? At what point is the dose not the dose and can’t be passed by quality control? Let me know if you know, I’m curious
Why do i have a feeling i already saw that guy calling imperial system stupid , a few years ago on veritasium?
Could u  do an episode on hypnosis ?
False. The silicon sphere is mor accurate
he just like my dad
This job is so much more important than say investment bankers
Unlike his other videos, Derek didn't need to break down any info in depth. This man explained everything simply and eloquently
I think it's not obvious why the uncertainty grows with subdivision. I understand why, but it won't completely obvious to others and it could be briefly explained.
This was very interesting. Right on the heels of the news about the new larger and smaller SI units. Thanks for sharing.
This guy is so passionate about small things and nice to listen to. Wanted to crack a joke but he doesn't deserve it.
Is there any correlation between the kilogram's value changing over the years with Earth's gravity getting heavier? I am really curious
So can we finally get back to measuring the body immediately before and after death to see if there is a measurable difference. If the soul and/or spirit is energy, and they leave the body when we die, couldn't we measure this? It seems like we now have technology capable of this.
glad he didn't bring in evolution in this one
I can't stop thinking that a simple sneeze in that lab would erase a work of a lifetime
I bet this man is the man everybody working there calls for a drink. He's so......inviting.
I like the part where he's holding an orange balloon and we don't get an explanation why.
Good damnit. Video is 1 hour shorter than I would wanna look at it. So interesting
Metrology is super underated for sure.
I had to get an analytical microbalance for my lab, with a 1ug resolution. The difference in price from a standard balance, 1mg resolution, to one such microbalance is 10-fold. That extra precision is difficult and expensive
Really glad I can watch your videos it makes me happy all the time, under any condition. I would suggest this to any living thing on Earth. 😊Thanks for you helpful videos and interesting ones.
this man looks like the Wozniak of weighing things
Dude, how did you break your iPhone camera glass?!?! Aren't those things sapphire?
Great video!!! Love all of them.....but this was one of the best!
love people who are enthusiastic about their work.
Love this man's energy.   This isn't meant in any political way, but it kind of made me think of Boris Johnson's infectious enthusiasm in his early days as mayor of London.
Outstanding.
Veritasium is the best YouTube channel
Maybe one day the US will realize they aren't unique for avoiding metric, and that the rest of the world just thinks they're stupid for it XD
I love when people are excited about the things they do
Loved this guy's enthusiasm!
Just stepping back and letting this guy talk and only interjecting at some choice moments was great
Ask her if she came
I love these videos, always learning stuff I never thought I wanted to know. I also love seeing the enthusiasm of the people who do these amazing things so we can learn from them. It shows they are excited about what they do yet so little people know them and their jobs even exist. Bravo <3
WOHOOO AFM!!!! btw people used this also to measure  the forces of cells in your  immune system ;)
Had a thought, if this tech is going to improve the abilities of scientific measurement and increase the scope on how its measured, it's going to be a heck of a job for you tubers to get across to the average person how it's done in a way to understand. 🤯
Find an excuse to talk to this guy more. He's a great presenter.
Love this video. The passion and way he shares knowledge is so engaging.
Mf using minecraft music
It was a pleasure listening to the explanations of Dr. Shaw! Thank you so much.
Great cool guy, makes you feel good about humanity! <3
Great video, very interesting and the guy looks like he really loves his job
This dude is the best!
Veritasium guy: Can I pick it up?   MICRO PANIC ATTACK
Ugh! Not long enough. This video was amazing and Rich always great. I could watch another 60 min of how this lab works.
Oh my gosh 😂 "Yes, the US is secretly metric... They just apply a correction factor to get to FREEDOM UNITs" dying over here.
oh god the most complicated video ever
This must be the most useless scientific achievement of them all.
Cool. What was the red balloon demo? Some electrostatic charge demo?
That guy is a real life mad-scientist. So cool.
His enthusiasm is so great and pure i admired it.
Funfact: when Plank named the constant 'h', it was named after 'hilfskonstante', meaning 'helping constant'. As many big discoveries, it wasn't obvious from the beginning that it was a big discovery.
NIST needs its own YouTube channel.
So cool.
Metrology is so neat. These people are brilliant
I've never seen a more interesting person in my whole life, he talks through his heart and straight into mine. I had no chance, I remember every word he said in this video.
He seem like such a great person ^^
This was such a great video! Dr Shaw articulated everything so well.
Is that Matt Farahs cousin?? (@thesmokingtire)
He would make any scientific topic interesting. I hope NIST let’s him out of the laboratory to do PR.
Awesome guy.
"Can I ask you the big question?" "Yeah, yeah." *Puts down ballon.* 😅
I love videos like this because I’m just as interested in how we know what we know as I am in what we know. The energy in this video is particularly great :)
man i just really love how every single guest on this channel is so passionate about their work and beyond excited to talk about it. this guy's such a blast
He's just so excited about his job. I love his dedication!
at 7:55,  the unit is meter per second squared :P)
His enthusiasm is awesome, this is a great video!
what if you spit micro drops when you talk on the weight and the spit changes the weight? 😯
you can clearly tell that this guy is totally loving his job and showing/explaining stuff !!! I really enjoyed it !!!! props to Dr. Gordon Shaw !  I would gladly listen to a 2 hour long Ted Talk of him talking about his work ;-)
I love this guy
This guy is amazing.
At 5:45,   you mistakenly wrote the quantities corresponding to each parameter (numerator/denominator). In other words, yu have flip flop the numbers :)
wow
His voice constantly remind me of Boris Johnson
I'm not. I like cooking approximately by eye and getting things about right ;)
Just for the reminder ..... " Freedom units " is just another name for " Retards ".
one of the most INTERESTING episodes ever !!! at least for me !!! Thanks a lot !!! Gracias !!!
the way you change thumbnail to see which one does better is funny and amazing i clicked  on video 2 times wondering they are diffrent video then realizing you just changed the thumbnail. nice video btw
WOW!!!
my proteins don't fold and unfold, they jiggle jiggle
1 Mole = 6.022 × 10²³ atoms/molecules l = Element/Elements in Grams
Micro, then Nano and that is 10³... thanks Chemistry!
Really cool stuff!
That video felt like 3 minutes, That guy was very captivating.
The tiniest force is actually the love my crush feels for me.
Maybe a naive question but why do we even need these standard weights? Imagine a world without standard weights meaning we would only remove the physical platinum/iridium blocks. 1kg of platinum is extremely expensive for a usual 0815 dude (around 32000€ at the time of commenting). So sending around these replicas would mean maybe even millions of dollars of cost but for what? Why do we need the physical objects? Can someone help me out here
As a watchmaker I loved this!!
His final answer was kinda amazing. Ye some people make money out of it, but dude I can measure forces using a lazer shuttup man.
Worth mentioning Sabine's argument that measuring extremely small forces could be a _huge_ deal in the coming decades if we can measure the force due to gravity from a body that's in a quantum superposition state. Somewhere between measuring ever smaller forces and getting ever larger masses in coherent superpositions, we might experimentally find out whether gravity acts quantum-mechanically, which is exciting no matter the answer.
Another great video... I'd never heard of NIST prior to your introduction.
Awesome information as always, needs a better thumbnail, almost scrolled through
Could anyone upload a clip from 0:53 to 1:13 to YouTube? Haha  Great video, BTW!
you found the right guy to ask
Not hard to measure how cool this video is ——————ALOT‼️
“Yes, it’s stupid” *smiles*
This guy is so passionate and interesting, BRAVO!
I think this is the most intriguing video I've seen from you in a long while. I think like others are saying the guy who brought you in and explained everything is a big part of that
10:44 priceless reaction 😂
I watch this channel to remember what happiness is
Mind blown as always 👍 Thank you.
mindblowing video. never considert how hard ut is to measur this. Great work, and great explaination of this Prof
There was a great documentary called “The last artefact”, about the worldwide debate on the removal of the kg masses. It is in iPlayer in the UK if you’re interested.
Maybe he'll find antman in the quantum realm.
The thumbnail changed
6:40 - 7:19 No clue what he saidbut its great to see a man who loves his work this much.
I have been a fan of yours for over 10 yrs. But your "freedom units" quip was so insulting I will be unfollowing you. The American ideal of independence (intellectual independence in this case) is and has been the greatest force for scientific advancement in the history of the world. Uniformity of thought is the anthesis of science. Your livelihood doesn't exist without American Freedom, and you would be speaking Chinese. Take care to not bite the hand that feeds you as you live under the protection of America but espouse a One World One System with extreme smugness.
Why do you talk an that (gay) way to seem smart? Talk N O R M A L L Y ! (haha)
So cool! Well done, we want more!
Ohhh
Not colabbing with styropyro was a mistake.
That Mettler Toledo AE230 is frustrating until you realize it’s only one button. Then it’s easy to calibrate using the internal cal weight
It is not true. That light not have any weight. It is all about rising up surface temp. by laser and its effect like mini roket. Dont be fool please.
I think that guy loves his job.
I want to hear more from this guy. What a fantastic ... explainator?
Many here have said it already, but I love the passion he has for his job! The way his eyes shine... And the the absolute pride in his face when he talks about how difficult it was to create that 1μg. Simply lovely!
But does that room really on 20°C? The air conditioner is not that precise, and what if a picodegree afects a nanogram in precision? Huh?
Fun!
I could listen to this guy for HOURS
This guy can weight a minute
Has this guy ever met Destin's Dad?
"yes its stupid!"
"yes, it's stupid" I loved that haha
"Photon pressure force" is definitely something to take away from this.
"It's stupid" - NIST, 2022
"When you take Plank's constant at a Kibble balance and you realize the kilogram, you're at that level of about 10 micrograms." Dr. Shaw has his way with words
In the NIST series, let's churn through the next unit.
PSA: The same people who say this type of endeavor is a waste of time ad money, are the very same that will turn around and waste time/money taking autonomy rights from women, fighting for laws to make trans/gay people subhuman, defend big money in politics, and line up to brown nose people like Joe Rogan, Elon, Stalin/Putin, and Donnie Tinyhands.   Priorities...
Who says America is not doing cool science anymore? I can listen to this guy all day.
Mind Blown 🤯they can measure the force of a laser pointer ?! wow
That tiny weight is cool but people underestimate the danger of having something such a small weight. Did you notice the guy had a special orange hard hat on? That's a specific kind of PPE designed to stop tiny tiny objects from falling and piercing your skull. If a gust of wind or a sneeze event ever happened near that tiny weight it could be accelerated up to mach 5 in the blink of an eye and penetrate all the way through a human skull. Thus a special low mass hardhat must be worn at all times.
Well, considering that the conversion math is easy… You just do your arithmetic in metric then switch it to imperial or whatever you’re used to. I hope it never changes just to keep everyone thinking we all wear cowboy hats and say Yee Haw! I don’t care what other people think about the US. Suck it. I want to hear scientists and educators complain about this non issue long past my lifetime. When saying the date I will always say the month first. Always. Just because you’re stupid for caring how I do it. Now, run along and be dumb!
That guy is so cool, in my opinion.
I mean guys, cmon thats pretty average
Reminds me of Ox Tools (Tom) comparing the thickness of different Sharpie marks on a steel gauge block. The enthusiasum is similar!
You could use your iPhone’s macro mode.
⭐🙂👍
Are the parts in the kibble balance made of gold.  Was hoping someone would mention it in the comments
I'm not a religious watcher of this channel, but the guys energy was on point, and kept me from clicking away
me·trol·o·gy /məˈträləjē/ noun the scientific study of measurement.  Ok that is my new word of the day.
somehow this feels very US centric...
Does breathing all over the tiny things make them weigh more?  What does 1200ug look like?
VERY cool stuff !!
I love his enthusiasm there. It's addictive!
I love this guy, he's so fun.
11:45 Varying the force imparted by the change in momentum of the photons striking sinusoidally sounds cool af.
Fascinating!  Thank you for sharing this video with us!
I am still dumbfounded by the fact that the imperial system even still exists, I mean just think about how stupid all different units for volume are in imperial.
Keen to find out whether they are yet able to measure Trump's pecker.
I actually have a funny story about NIST, not directly related to this video but I think it's worth sharing nonetheless. In a lab for my quantum mechanics class we were matching the emission line wavelengths from atomic light sources to the energy state transitions that caused them. To do this, we looked at NIST's values for the total energy of each atomic orbital and then found which wavelength emission corresponded to each gap between energy levels. My professor let us know that he would need to give us the energies of all Helium states with an n quantum number of 4, because they weren't available on NIST anymore. Apparently, and he swears this is true, the values used to be on the NIST website but when the government shut down in 2017, they temporarily shut down the website. When they brought it back, for whatever reason, these values for the energy states of Helium were missing. Thankfully my professor had these values recorded for himself, but he might be one of the few people out there who still has easy access to that obscure piece of information, which I find hilarious.
When you get to a point where you are able to measure a single particle or know what the force is of DNA when you stretch it, it's a bit ridiculous.... But also extremely fascinating and I could play there all day.    😊
Before this video I wonder how many people knew the force of a laser pointer off the top of there head. This man has a very massive knowledge level of a very precise subject (no pun intended:). I really enjoy talking to people like that because you are guaranteed to learn something. And that something might be known by less than a couple dozen people on the planet.
I love how excited this guy gets about measurements.
One of the rare videos where Derek doesn't have to explain something on the side. He pretty much stood there and let Gordon do all the explaining. Fantastic man.
Planck constant is just a consequence of a bad and limited logic, not a nature limit. 😉
That little microgram stainless steel piece looks very familiar though...
The right molecule at the wrong place at the wrong time can make all the difference in the world
5:50 Let's just open this Kibble balance machine, and poke around without wearing gloves, masks or other containment prevention wear.
DEREK PLEASE, start including your logo or something identifiable into the thumbnail. I constantly miss seeing your videos because there is no identity to your thumbnails
I love how this guy had props ready to explain things on a scale that has no meaning to a vast majority of people.  "The amount of force to pull apart DNA 🧬" - thanks very helpful I was just playing with my DNA slinky on tiny stairs this morning. 🙄
I work in precision measurements as a career. This is really exciting to see. Amazing video. This man was so excited about his tools and I feel that!
I can't help but wonder if the moons position can interfere with these measurements. Amazing video. Thank you!
I love how he keeps finding people that are so enthousiastic about so unknown yet interesting science  projects
I m fan this man and channel
My mom is undergoing chemotherapy right now. And we apply a patch of painkiller (fentanyl) on her skin that says 25 mcg/hr on it. It's replaced every 72 hrs. After warching this video and seeing how difficult precision measurement is at these scales, I wonder what the error margin is for these patches.
It blew my mind when I started getting into microscopy and could see some of the things on the slides...   Without a scope
How come I’m just now realizing that lasers can exert a force?
Someone call Cody's lab
I love these people!
Nice! So just combine 10^11 laser pointers and you get a force of about 1 N. Well, by force at least. never mind they'd have to be monochromatic and in phase and all that.
wow, that was very interesting. To measure the power of a laser. Absolutely fantastic. Thank you for this post.
He reminds me so much of Rana Adhikari in the videos about gravitational waves. Same passion, same enthusiasm. Man, I could listen to these guys all day long ♥️
1:58 But how to know if it is the mass or if it is the balance which is imperfect? ? (they are both i imagine, btw errors of mass and balance, add up, multiply or Something else ? +- 5 and +- 7 give +-12, +-35, +-? , i would say errors add up, if error of mass is -5 and error of balance is -7, we have -12 in total errors, but i can get wrong)
I love this man's enthusiasm.
Pro tip: don't sneeze in there!
I feel like I bought mushrooms from Gordon back in the 90's.
At last! Now I know how the thrust of an ion rocket engine can be measured!
“Yes, it’s stupid” 💀
it only takes one enthusiastic scientist to get someone invested in a subject and comments prove that. it makes me so happy
Well at least the depth under ground of the lab explains the length of his hair.
The units are not "freedom units". It was called the "Imperial System" with the Britich Empire, and its the Imperial System now. Lovely irony.
Yup, inspiring, cool, passionate but all I kept thinking was what does one of his hairs weigh.
That man is a fantastic speaker, also kinda reminds me of Dan Olson from Folding Ideas!
I love the guys attitude, reminds me how I explain to people about my field of work, which is Field Calibration. I take pride making sure instruments are working in their highest accuracy, so end products are guaranteed to work properly
Priyanka or Ankit ne hamesha sumbul or abdu ko Dil SE pyaar kiya but they always get hate from them
I love this guy! He really knows what he's talking about and has a passion to share it, I loved learning about it
Kudos to Atomic Force Microscopy
I wonder if the kilograms diverged because they had different proportions of radioisotopes in them. Alpha decay changes mass a lot, but even beta decay could make a difference.
Omg did you just say freedom units? 🤣🤣
'Can I ask the real question?' i was hoping he would say; 'so what's your weight?'
I thought the Kg was redefined in silicon atoms to remove the uncertainty?
What a legend. Applies to both of you.
Love this dude. More dudes like him, please!
This is really cool. Thing is all I can think about is how much this guy makes and how meaningless his job is to me and how hard I’ve worked in my life and the amount of money I’ve ended up with and I guess how meaningless my life is.
So, that was truly entertaining and interesting. What a cool topic and good mood guy . Love it
9:13 - OK the fact that they DID actually get it?? RESPECT.
Pretty good video
Joe Rogan: Heavy Breathing*
Gravity is still an open variable. There is no absolute gravity
imperial units are fake, like that.
Hahaha we're all metric in the end. Just give up the more impractical and let's all agree the metric system is the better one to work with
The World's Roundest Object video was almost a decade ago. Wow.
Hey yall's the whole world uses a non-metric unit measure for time! So before getting on your high mighty horse about metric, remember that time is not measured in metric (until you are measuring less than seconds).
Imagine if this guy went on a diet and seriously started training and had his skin turned green.
Ohhhh, this is SWEET! Ever since I heard the news, a year or two ago, that The Kilogram had been retired as the international standard of measurement, I had been SUPER CURIOUS to see one of those electro-weighing machines! Dang, no wonder this channel has so many subscribers! Totally worth it!
Them: Laser pointers can stretch DNA Me: New fear unlocked
Great video. So interesting 🙂
🤯...that's more than I can handle... or should I say... "less than I can handle"?!?!...WTF...idk!
There is nothing I hate more then people telling me how America is stupid for using the imperial system. Just use metric for engineering and stuff like that and let us use our own units in the day-to-day.
Why too short😭
The metric system isn’t the only thing they took away from us, A4 tuning from 432 to 440. 😢
I could listen to that dude all day long, he's such a good vibe
Veritasium and this thiosis2 are the only two science channels which show the application of the abstract and also consult labs and experts of the same field for more overview, kudos Derek kudos 👍.
6:00 so hilarious to me that something that expensive and complicated has parts held by a zip tie.
"Yes. Its stupid" Most concise and correct answer to the united states having an actual metric system then converting it to fuckups
🤯
i really like the way you make your videos , like a perfectly crafted science lecture.
I love this sort of stuff, especially when you're talking to someone that is obviously so passionate about their subject.  The only thing that surprised me about this, was that the whole place wasn't one big clean room with dust causing major problems with measurements.
awesome video and an awesome guy
This guy is pure gold. My burning question: How do you construct this weights and even more: how do you produce such fine "springs"? How do you form a piece of metal which could be bend by a laserpointer?
I was imagining someone sneezed and all of the tiny weights going all over the room .. lol. Doh!!
Passionate people are a gift
He looks unnervingly similar to my chemistry teacher
I want his enthusiasm in everything I do. Bloody inspiring !
They may yet solve the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.
I'm not sure about that hard hat.
The question how did they make that 10 microgram thing deserves a complete video.
This makes me wonder, if you were to heat up a sample would it weigh more? Like if you heated the 1mg stainless steel reference weight to like 1,000°? Because E=MC^2 so wouldn't adding energy in the form of heat affect the weight? Or am I being really dumb?
guy: explains his job like a normal person internet: omg he is so passionate, this is AMAZING
Me watching the video and appreciating this guy ..   ** opens up comments and see majority of top comments saying the same thing **  life's purpose seems fulfilled now.
That man is a national treasure
You guys almost found me. :O
Give NIST more funding
What a cool guy... 🙃 Great video.
When a photo pushes something does the photon lost , or does it lose energy?
i've been to those labs.  i work with AFMs, we have one down in that building, just a few rooms over.  It's used to characterize nanometer standards. cool stuff.
thanks for the episode awesome as always btw Cody's Lab has done the push force at home in one of his old vids ^^ thanks again for the video
I knew you'd get more from your visit to NIST, awesome stuff
That guy was awesome.
Everyone, me included, love this lab guy. He's got so much positive energy and he sounds like Seth Rogen if he hadn't spent 40 years smoking.
the fact that veritasium hesitated to call it “freedom units” is hilarious 😅
Pretty cool proof of enthusiasm being contagious.
HOW DO THEY COME UP WITH THESE DEVICES🤯
I could just like one of the other many comments instead of echoing, but it deserves to be said. This guy is completely wholesome with his 'kid in a candy shop' level of excitement over what he does, made all the more sweet and engaging by the stupefying level of physics he's working with to achieve those measurements.
This guy (I guess physicist?) is the best and I hope he goes on to be a science communicator. The man needs a YouTube channel!
I was a nurse for decades and all measurements in medicine are metric.    Photon pressure force?  That's Star Trek stuff.  Fascinating video.  My first degree was in chemistry so accurate weights were essential, especially in analytic chemistry.  I surely regret not pursuing a career in this field.
Precision metrology scientists further allowing precision metrology engineers to create even finer instruments for studying the world is a spectacular phenomenon, as long as society persists we will never run out of discoveries about how our world works on a macroscopic scale from microscopic principles
Amazing. These are the best kind of videos on YT IMO👍
Yes-ish
I am a biophysicst and spend all day thinking in the order of femto Newton to pico Newton and measuring these forces to study proteins. It's so fun to hear someone talk about this with so much enthusiasm.
Topic's quite similar to PBS BeSmart about the absolute unit.   Great work on both. Learned alot from both videos.
Great video horrible thumbnail
He is so passionate and it gives good curiosity
I hate how they say "tiniest forces in the universe" We continue to discover new and smaller (and larger) things all the time. Saying something IS the smallest thing is presumptuous. What if the smallest thing we can possibly physically see with our eyes even including the advancement of technology in 100 years... is just the outer shell of an entire universe similar to ours?  Then... what we see *wouldn't* be the smallest thing
In fact, metrology is a science of measuring errors of measurement
Love it!  Notice how he references the International System of units.  Would be really great if future videos would follow the SI when using units and prefixes . . .  ;-)
The weights are mostly used to determine the weight of the bulkiest players in the Fifa World cup
one of your best 😀 ! like the one with the roundest object; i really like when you explain the UNIT-system ! 10:25 cool dude by the way, why did he have an orange balloon ? is he a Dutch footballfan ? 🤣🤣🤣
I really want to meet and talk to this guy.
Being metric and converting to imperial is the U.S. Government U.S. Governmenting
The US is secretly metric, but the go to measuring system always will be football fields
9:39 hehehe that's 10micro gram. .  Haaah even derek was like whaaaat hahahahah priceless expression @ 10:46
Hahah freedom units😆
that dude has way too much hair for a clean lab environment
Wow that was such an inspiring video. I'm going at NIST Boulder in january to continue my master's degree. I'm excited to meet this kind of reasearcher, I feel like I'm gonna learn so many new things!
One of the best videos yet, I loved every second of it! This guy is awesome!
Going to need you to stop distracting me with your interesting and engaging content. I'm never going to finish making this program at this rate 😛
Brilliant. As always!
But you didn't ask THE ACTUAL most important QUESTION: how does this chicken and egg problem end? The precision problem was just pushed from mass to electricity + mass of those fancy vacuum parts. At some point you need a "scale lever" to interact with those tiny changes (e.g. lithography uses lenses), what is the this mechanism to start of cycle?
So awesome!  I love the enthusiasm behind all of this.  Thank you so much for haring this with us.  :)
this awesome person reminds me of the scientist in independence day
I'm convinced this man is a wizard
We decided to go away from the physical representation of a kilogramm. now we're dependent on gravity, temperature, precision of capacity scales in the kibble balance and the time of the year =) Now it is super accurate....ish
How they measure liquid?
I wish I loved my job as much as this man lol
i can travel all over the world if i have 💲 but i can't 🧠 🧑‍💻⚛️
one on electro metrology please how HP colorado calibration a reference voltage for 8 digit for 12v std with a small ppms per year
He's got one of the coolest jobs on the planet!    Thanks for sharing!
OMG... can anyone think of a word other than "passionate" to describe this guy? Jeeze.
*insert innuendo*
Is there a invisible layer of Hydrogen in sun 🌞  that yet to fuse
How is the measurement system with the laser and oscillating thingy called?
This answered long term questions I had. Side note, I wonder if this guy uses a heaping teaspoon or regular when baking?
omg we found the one american that is smart enough to know they are being stupid.
For a moment I also wondered where such tiny measures are useful. After his response I switched to "damn, this is used everywhere".
wish this was a longer video. could listen to that guy all day
This was totally AWESOME. Thanks
Hell yeah I love me a good bit of metrology in the evening
This man talks near this sensitive device and on top of sensitive small weights without caring about the amounts of sticky spit he is depositing. He and Veritasium should be waring face masks. Or am I wrong?
Dr. Gordon Shaw: That‘s a good question.  Me: Now where does that balloon come in?
Can you make a video "How other elements are came to be"
Honestly, That guy should run the channel.  What a character
It's a delight to listen to Dr. Shaw. You can really feel his exitement!
i think this is the real life hank pym
I love this guy, such great energy. Would be awesome to figure out how to do more projects with him.
I love seeing this kind of video.  it's something/a question I never really considered, with an answer that's clearly presented that I would never have thought of, being presented by someone who is so goddamn infectiously passionate and excited about their work.  bonus points that he's also extremely skilled at speaking and presenting.
0:53 those "freedom units" are actually stoneage units. besides banana republics, who measures things in bananas? 1:01 "it's stupid!" yes it is. YES IT IS!
Measuring 0.01% freedom ;-)  Precision & accuracy is an art!
You can immediately spot someone how really knows and do what they talk about.
you have been cranking these vids out lately! love it!
5:31 and  5:50 If the graphics @ 5:31 is correct in relating mass m to the product  of Plank's constant h multiplied  by frequency f  and  divided by the square of  c, the speed of light, then the graphics @ 5:50 is at the very least problematic.
i used to think rockstars were cool but now i think NIST research chemists are cooler.
So much passion, love this guy! Incredible that we can measure down to femto newtons of force. The precission we now have is just insane.
wow that 10ug wire was incredible 😎
I love this guy very knowledgable and passionate
The guy sounds/ kinda talks like borris johnson but what he said was nothing like borris
This guy is so awesome
Doesn’t gravity change and therefore weight?
12:13 "Can I ask you "the" big Question?" "Yeah, yeah!" "Will you marry me?"
imagine if u sneeze working with these things
Loved the guy, he's a metrology wizard
Strange that it's possible for him to speak/spit into this precision scale, w/o wearing a mask.
Wow Veritasium, I have a final exam over this stuff today. You have impeccable timing!
this dude is awesome i love his passion
I'd love to take a class that guy would teach
Guy has been put under ground and doing stuff a lot of people probably won’t care about, he looks so happy to have people come and record his profession to people of the world love it
Can you use a laser to power a spaceship/satellite ? Either the satellite emits light and experiences a reaction force of say femtoNewtons OR from earth, you point the laser toward the satellite and the reflexion makes it "bounce". I am aware that fN are extremely low forces but if that's the only force the spacecraft is experiencing, it will still accelerate right ? I guess the question could be resumed as "is there somewhere in space where gravitational fields are negligible against a fN over the mass of the spacecraft ?"
I love this guy you're interviewing! So much fun
A very cool and passionate guest to interview! The fact that he casually throws around force numbers that are a THOUSANDTH of the force to stretch DNA is just mind blowing.
I hope he sees all the wholesome comments about him :)
this is like a sequel to one of my favorite veritasium videos !
Wow, that guy loves his job :)
Man’s literally measuring the weight of light
Thank you
The way Americans use commas and points in large numbers really confuses me!
I wonder if he also keeps his 10ùg tiny little hair looking like stainless steel wire in a nitrogen environment instead of an oxygen rich environment...
THE GUY YOU INTERVIEWED IS THE BEST PERSON I HAVE SEEN IN YOUR CHANNEL .
Would love to see a follow-up video about measurement in quantum mechanics, eg. wave function collapse, decoherence, etc.
NIST is a great place and I am glad it exists. Thanks to your videos I have learned more of what they do.
I wanted to comment on Dr. Shaw and his amazing energy and joy throughout the video, went to the comments... and saw that everybody is already saying the same thing! :D Great video, great work as always Derek and the entire Veritasium team, and amazing guests.
5:29 but but  E=mc² doesn't apply to photons. So the correct equation should be hf=pc !? @Veritasium
The ability to measure the force of light is absolutely mind blowing
So interesting topic!  I learned a lot in these few minutes than an entire subject in school!
Measuring the tiniest forces in the universe? So you're measuring Russia's remaining combat strength in Ukraine, eh? :P
Metrology!
This is a better thumbnail👌🏻
This guys the best
I love learning about interesting subjects in a way that is understandable and relatable. More please…❤😘
This was really really cool. And when you think the topic is covered, you mind gets blown again by a force sensor using the pressure given by a beam of light from a laser. And shootout to the NIST researcher for the enthusiasm and clear explanations.
This was cool
Sad day. I never thought the term "freedom units" would come out of your mouth 😩
Veritasium 10 years later: the kilogram is dead part 1655829826347
Loved the energy of this man. Reminded me of my uncle.
I love all your trips to NIST! Reminds me of going there as  a kid to see my dad.
Me: 7 pineconetown
Fascinating...
6:49 applied science made one of these using an analogue volt meter.
shout out to this guy, what a joy to watch
I bet he wanted to do this as a kid.
Wow!   Thank you Dr. Shaw and Derek!
Oh wow, really? This is another gem of the channel!
Even the scientist think the imperial unit is stupid 😅😂
What an amazing man, love how passionate he is with his work
Patton beat back the hun with the mile, not the meter
Absolutely an amazing video! Some could say that this video was done with less effort than some of your other most recent videos, but I would say that this was one of your most informative and interesting videos in a good while!
10:04
I vote your background music the best jingle of a channel ever. Something nostalgic and peakingly interesting in it. cant be explained just love it
I'm just gonna ask it: how many picograms does the average US male genitalia weigh?
U are the first to cover on this modern subject.
I wonder if there is more uncertainty with smaller masses because they have less structured information that relatively larger masses
We want FREEDOM! (units)
Long Story Short ,,,Happy minds ,, Insight stuff ,, Made Simple, Thank you so much for sharing the happiness of knowing and Learning
Brilliant.
And this is why I got into machining
Looking at that thumbnail, i just realized veritasium looks a lot like physics girl. So tgis is what happens when you do too much science. Its like a drug.
Муратов решил еще и нобелевку по физике получить?
someone should get him to play with the double slit experiment
This dude is so cool. He'd be mint to work with.
So that’s what Boris Johnson is up to to nowadays after the resignation 😂
Metrology is such a unique blend of scientific theory and engineering know how.
This is absolutely insane, being able to measure force of a laser beam? I hope there will be more videos like these.
The level of precision they can measure hurts my brain... that is SO cool. I had no idea we could measure to such an insignificant degree, which funnily enough is really significant... love it.
This video should be an inspiration for every nerd like me out there. The passion of pushing the research to the limit is one of the absolute pleasures in life. IMHO, obviously
NIST is such an incredible institution, it's hard to overstate how important of a role they play in our world. Massive respect to everyone who works there, and thank you Derek for featuring them in your videos and educating more people about what they do.
Love this guy's energy
Zip tie at 6:05 (:
So if I'm understanding this correctly...that kibble balance literally uses a flux capacitor?
Amazing video. I love the scientist you spoke to. He made me so excited to listen to him
There's nothing better than listening to passionate people talk about what they're passionate about.
"Yes, it's stupid" great guy 😁
I thought I saw a video of tiny piece of gold foil being moved by laser light many years ago, but was never able to find it again. This shows the phenomenon - imagine measuring the pressure of light photons!
His knowledge, passion and enthusiasm for his job are rare. I'll bet you could ask him what his magnificent belly weighed, and he would ask if you want it in pounds, kilograms, or Planck units!
I love how often a scientist whose entire job is to be as accurate and precise as possible ends things in "-ish"
I'm glad that america still uses the imperial system. Those words sound infinitely better in a song :D
mantap
*Creating an environment that can happen...* thats what a scientific frontier looks like in recursion.
How much does gravity weigh?
This guy actually looks like some1 who loves their job, I mean u can see the excitement in his eyes whenever veritasium asks a question
And the universe is expanding 🤔
This takes me back to the first video I saw of you!  It was the one with the roundest ball on earth, made from silicon to get the amount of atoms needed to get precisely 1 kg Big fan since that video!
That is really fascinating. I'd love to see a part two (if it's possible) about how you go about making the tiny, ultra precise devices he was talking about, because to make something that precise has got to involve some pretty amazing engineering
lol he could have recorded that thing with his iPhone, they’re extremely good at macro videos
Love people who are so into and great at such niche topics. Very charismatic at it too.. 🙂
`ISH laboratory
Piconewtons. I've never had that flavor...
Oh, a new Veritasium? That's an immediate click!
I don't have words to express how I enjoyed this content.  Thank you Veritasium.
7:57 how do the measure absolute gravity?
If nothing else, I hope more Americans understand their country is actually metric after watching this
me adding my comment amongst the others appreciating how passionate this guy was to share his work and wealth of knowledge with the world. fantastic video!
It's people like this that can make any "boring" topic absolutely fascinating. This person is amazing and I'm entirely grateful for his contagious enthusiasm to get me interested in things that would otherwise seem "boring."
9:16 Seth Rogan enters the room
Here before the inevitable title and/or thumbnail change 👌
g = pi^2
"Oh wow, those weights are so sma....ATCHOO!     I am so sorry...."
Never ask what to Use it. It is fantastic by itself
Wouldn't the mass of Dr. Shaw throw of the measurements? Surely his gravitational field could be measured with this equipment.
I'm glad that you got back in the den of metrialism deep in Imperial country.
I heard NIST. Make a video about Meat Homogenate please
Now i know why new 1kg dumbbells are getting lighter by decade.
Can i say something absolute terrible thumbnail i almost didnt click but im glad i did as always
0:47 "...and yes, the US is secretly metric."  I feel that now I know the secrets of the world
Too many /ishes/ for the most accurate lab in the world.
I like this as long has he doesn’t have Bill Nye or talk about sex.
How quickly do you get kicked out of the lab for sneezing on a weight?
How to bring a staple to show and tell and still have the coolest thing:
This man really loves his job. Thanks for another amazing video!
Yes.   We use *Metric.*  And we also use *Freedom Units.*   But what we *DO NOT* do is *CONVERT* between the two.   It's the converting that's silly.  Use either one or the other -- whichever suits the purpose.   There's no use in going from one to the other for anything.
Never doubt the power of freedom units. If kilograms so good why didn’t they win ww2
I learned a lot.
So what exactly do you do? Its easier if you watch this video
I like this guy. I was watchin on TV and something about the interview just made me pull out my phone and write this comment just in case he sees it. Keep up the great work!
The passion this man speaks about his field is so inspiring!
truly awesome person !!!
Cant believe i just a video to measure the weight of my eyelash hair.
.
Thank you for bringing those lenses; we would never see that hair (9:20) otherwise :D My wife also has those lenses, she can see any size of hair other than hers on the sit of our car...
"absolute with an absolute... 9.801-ish"   :'D
I love this parallel universe where the US has been secretly on the metric system *this whole time*
Voicecrack at 1:13
It makes me happy that this guy got to share his knowledge with someone who apreciates it for a day, it must be hard to get someone excited about precision measurements. I hope he gets to read that we learned a lot today thanks to him!
I love his energy.... He's exiting to tell something
Thank you for video.
Wow man what a guy! He was a really really good guest!
As a scale technician, I love your videos on weights and measures. Great stuff!!
Absolutely loved this man
I AM THE 826th COMMENT!!
So, in watching this, I want to know: did anyone go back with the electromagnetic balance and measure the old kilogram standards given to each country to figure out in what direction their masses diverged?  And, has their been any post-mortem on the causes of the divergence?
Love this.  Please, more people like this on the channel.
Free Julian Assange
Super interesting video! One of my favs. Dr. Gordon was so amazing to listen to, his excitement, knowledge and his ability to eloquently and clearly explain concepts made it even more enjoyable
This was fascinating! I hope we get a revisit of this place!
The best job in the world
12:17 what side tangent did he go on that lead to him pointing an orange balloon at the camera? Lol
What is not understood should not always be considered stupid.  The foot, meter, and cubit are all important and relate to different universal constants.
Thank you so much for allowing millions of people like us across the world learn all this stuff, ive literally learned so much insane crazy cool stuff from this channel over the years, you are by far one of my favorite channels on youtube
Great video!
Man I would love to see a colab with Destin’s dad from Smarter everyday and these guys from this vid; Veratasium and the measurement guys and have a chat about measurements this deep on space stuff like the JWST and other cool stuff that are out there.
1:00 noice.
This man really shows passion. He's at at with his job.
how you measure my stronk though?
Would love 30min videos of yours
Secretly using the metric system? It's no wonder we can't get another man on the moon.
Super interesting!
I like this guy
7:53 isn't it supposed to be metres per second square ?
a.k.a, me going to the gym
Been watching your channel for years. Clearly I enjoy it. But why are you compelled to be a dick about Imperial system? We all get it.
PLEASE more videos like this! I could listen to people like him for hours! There are so many like him doing incredible scientific things that almost nobody ever sees. Videos like this really give those people the praise they deserve!
Question: When we reach such incredible precise depths in the range of Femtonewtons and beyond, doesn't our Environment influence the Measurement beyond Significance? I've actually never heard Metrologists talk about the Influences of Gravity, like the molten Mantels inside Earth shift and are in constant turmoil, some heavier Stream of Lava/Magma making some exact Point on top Earth's Surface a tiny bit heavier or lighter, or the speed of Earth's Rotation slowing down and speeding up, changing the Gravitational Constant.   Also also: as per Einstein's theory of Relativity, Gravity is not the only Factor. Sunlight hitting something outside vs no light inside excerpts a different Force. According to his Theory, a Flashlight turned on loses weight, however really really little (the mass of its Components divided by speed of light squared). On top of that, something measured at the top of Mount Everest has more potential Energy than something at Sea level, right? Which would then also Manifest as Mass or "Rest Mass" according to Relativity?  In Conclusion: Isn't the only place to make such fine Measurements in outer space, millions of light years away from any other Object's Sphere of Influence? And even then, quantum fields might still play a role… DO NOT take anything I've said at face value, by far no Metrologist, physicist or Scientist at all, just an admirer of Science! Thank you Veritasium for all you do <3  EDIT: sorry, he actually even talked about it at 11:55 ;) So i guess I'm not too far off, right?
All this video and I still don't know how my electric bathroom scale is lying to me.
I liked this video.  Plus or minus 7 femtolikes.
I want to see this guy and SmarterEveryDay's dad in a room. I bet it evolves into a "what's the coolest thing you ever measured" contest.
So cool!!! 😊
Sufentanyl is several thousands of times stronger than morphine, and dosages are often in the nanogramme range, so accurate dosing is critical.
do planck time next.  If planck time is the digital measurement of time and it can be applied to the phase rate of all matter, like, 4.32ghz or something, then theoretically you could program reality like a computer.  You'd also need super cooled quantum cpu.s and stuff, of course.
I'd love to know how they determined how much force was required to stretch out a strand of DNA molecules and why that's become a standard of measurement for them lol
He measures things in the lab to an exact detail, but every number he gives ends in "-ish".
Really cool dude
Lasers confuse me.  I, perhaps wrongly, understood that lasers contained no information.  That's why there's no breaking of the laws of physics when you shine a laser on the moon and then move the laser...from the perspective of someone on the moon measuring that movement, the laser moves faster than the speed f light....so there's something there about "no information" being stored in the laser beam.  So how can a laser exert a force?
Did I miss where this lab is in the US?
This man is AWESOME. The way he is so excited to share, his analogies, and explanations are filled with passion. Truly a cool guy and I’m glad someone like him got to have the spotlight and share his knowledge and fascinations
Stop changing the title.
He was so passionate explaining this, that I watched the sponsor spot without noticing.
What they do there is cool, but useless
Thank you for posting
banger video as always
that dude definitely weighs his weed on the lab scale
I wish my teachers were like that guy. Absolutely passionate about the thing he does! Loved it, as always.
As someone who has recently got into medicine and organic chemistry and has just begun to understand the importance of accurate measurements, this video is fascinating.
Ironic that the US is the one supplying the world with metric reference measurements.
my dad used to work for w&t avery from the 30's up until at least the 60's and brought home all manner of weights and weighing machines, i worked with him for a while and to this day my little fingernail on my right hand is split in two from being crushed between 2 1/4 ton weighbridge testing roller weights. i recal punching extra lead into the bottom of weights to bring them back to their standard.
I'd love to be that excited about a profession
You always cover the most interesting topics we never knew we needed to know about, and find the most excited, passionate, fun people to interview. Keep up the amazing work Veritasium <3
Love when the person explaining mass says something then ish
This answered so many questions for me , and opened many more . Kudos to that man , nice introduction and i really loved his excitment
I'm most impressed by how well you low-key played up the suspense for capturing the 10ug on video.  I didn't realize how invested I was until I got super excited when I saw it.
I really want to see a video of the labs who make these references.
I just love how he casually says 10 micron iSH
Love it. Nothing better then a crazy science guy
Please do videos with experiments again, in which we have to guess what the outcome is.
I love this man! I get so excited from his excitement!
I had Metrology in my last semester and was not getting any interest in that but this video is just amazing and now I am actually able to recollect all those traceability and other terms that I just rot for my exams, lol. Only if you could have posted the video 1 month ago, I would have gotten much better grades in it :) Anyways, thanks for being consistent and frequent Derek.
I love how Dr. Gordon Shaw is so enthusiastic about his field of science
Another reason to have this level of accuracy is if you are working with a torque wrench or a micrometer, things that have a certified accuracy those are calibrated and adjusted based on comparisons to standards like gauge blocks or torque transducers and those standards are calibrated using even more accurate equipment and again till you get to the international standards, and this system allows you to get a reasonable degree of confidence in your equipment without going all the way to nist, but still having the confidence that nist can provide through traceability. So if you have a piece of equipment that has a calibration certificate that can more than likely be traced from one standard to another till you get to the universal constants measured by NIST
damn, this man's like me when i have to gossip w my bestie
This is so interesting! Loved it
His passion for measuring forces is really fun to watch
This guy was ripped off on a weed deal once and was never the same since
12:17 *Points with balloon*   "That's a good question."
It’s funny how veritasium constantly throws out all engineering realities when it comes to some of these statements. The uncertainties in almost all commercial production processes mean that these standards are useless to real products… these standards are only for physicists do precision work… which isn’t most physicists. The majority of design work and tolerances are specified in English units and created to those English units. In all likelihood only 1-2 of the machines in any shop were ever compared to a standard of this caliber with most being calibrated to a block of material of specified dimension and weight… you add on top of that, even precise work doesn’t use this standard… they create there own standards and conversions so their processes are accurate to the local gravity. For example, Albuquerque New Mexico has to compensate its equipment for the gravity the mountain causes or else their numbers will be off.
2:10 - I recognized Mettler scale immediately 😀 I used to work there. Good times... good times...
@~2:10, dope man ain't shortin this dude.
Well that was fascinating. I wish I loved anything as much as that dude loves measuring forces
This is so amazing! Well explained
I just keep seeing this guy as the guy from Umbrella Academy.
Really interesting, thank you for this Video!
1:00 OHH YES, the whole world (but some NORTHamericans) agree with that
Really cool video! I never gave this much thought before but it's actually very interesting
Is people like this guy who help us steer the wheel towards science, people who treasure and cherish for our ability to say how much certainty we have about a measurement, we might not think about it every day, but is people like this and places like nist that are true building blocks of our world today, and tomorrow. Cheers!
Do another for length. Plz
just like everybody else in the comments, *guy passionate* beats chest lol
love you Derek!
"Mom,Dad! I'm going to show my new friend Derek the new tiny toys I have...but I'll be showing him the big toys to explain them!"  "OK Gordon, just make sure to put everything away, and that you don't stretch anyone's actual DNA this time"  Kinda vibes, I love the enthusiasm, he clearly loves what he does. Very cool toys!
He mocks imperial measures, when it is just an arbitrary scale (and actually working in 12s can be good, mathematically) yet their scale is off by 0.0006 - I see many political problems here.
My mind is officially blown.  There's a way to measure the force of a laser pointer?  If a random guy told me that I would think he needed to increase his dosage.  It is truly amazing what science is capable of.  Now let's pause while someone thinks of a way to weaponize this.
You make awesome videos, Derek. But if this is awesome, then all the rest are, well, lacklustre.  I just wanna say a big thank you for your pain and dedication to making science fun and accessible to all! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
"you made this?"... "Yes...with great trouble!"   Uh.... yeah
All of these scales and balances in this video make my coffee scale infinitely primitive!  Love the last question on how r these precise measurements be applicable in real world use, the examples like drug formula r really good and easy to understand use cases.
Getting into the realm of gamma rays interfering with your measurements...
This was awesome! Loved every minute!
That bit about measuring the force of a laser beam goes to show that momentum is not dependent on mass. The laser is shooting out massless photons and imparting their energy onto the vibrating "diving board."
First of all great video what lens did you use and what microphone did you use?
Dr. Gordon Shaw is such an energetic person and is so passionate about his job! Love that!   The accomplishment of weighing such a small objects is truly mind-blowing!   Thanks for the video to all Veritasium crew and people from NIST. Good luck in your research!
You can NEVER TAKE OUR FREEDOM UNITS!
Veritasium: Wow the things in this petri dish are smaller than eye lashes and they *ACHOO!!!!!!!!* .... Veritasium: Uh we'll show ourselves out..
Hey Derek, you skipped "the Worlds Roundest Object", the video that got me into Veritasium. BTW, love the passion Dr. Gordon Shaw puts into his work and teaching about it.
This was fascinating and beautiful.  Makes me want to work in a place like this with such a passionate scientist. Please do more like these.
Fascinating. The guy is so likable, knowedgeable and enthusiast about this lab and his job, it's a delight to listen to him explain all of that. Thanks for the content !
It'd a scale that uses light?! Wow!
5:51 the music makes this so ominous lmao
I simply love this stuff. Thank you, Veritasium, best wishes,The Dutch Scouser in Amsterdam
The title sounds like me trying to workout at the gym
Second vid on nist. between this one and previous one, I kind of want to visit NIST myself some day just to get a tour to see what other cool things are there.
All these are okay but what can I do to make this guy adopt my new banana metric system?
kilograms got this much science going into perfectly defining it and americans still go "yeah weighs 2.5 elephants"
I have a serious question. Im having problems finding the answer. THE kilogram is a certain mass, but the wiegh itself is influenced by gravity. If I move replicas of it I agree that a kilogrma but on other latitudes due to gravity differences on the globe, how do we calibrate and/or counter it since we can not adjust gravity? I think of these as a Metrology question that Im having issues finding.
damn yall need a better. feel free to hmu. the interview with red shirt guy? how unnatural it feels to cut to the camera that he's looking at, and when he looks to the samples, cut to the second perspective? that should be exactly the opposite. it was jarring
What a wonderful Vibe this man carries 😍
As I scientist I worked in a lab where several procedures had ISO17025 accreditation. We had a balance (scales) that we had to calibrate daily when it was used. It came with calibration masses down to 10mg and they were just like a little fingernail sized piece of foil. Looking back at the video, it was the same balance as he uses at 2:05. I guess Mettler Toledo are the sine qua non of laboratory balances. Absolutely fascinating I can't even begin to get my head around how inconceivably small some of the values he was talking about.
This guy is awesome! You can tell he ABSOLUTELY LOVES his career and being able to speak with someone who is interested in it. So damn cool.
I just can’t believe that there’s a people with this passion and desire for doing scientific things is a life in this century particularly in this Society where TikTok and Instagram is the main thing they enjoy.😮😮😮😮
Why is this guy so overweight/unhealthy? He really needs to do something to make a change
the comic book guy is all grown up. he's done well
I just can’t believe that there’s a people with this passion and desire for doing scientific things is a life in this century particularly in this Society where TikTok and Instagram is the main thing they enjoy.😮😮😮😮
So many comments about how he's excited,   But really, it's weird seeing a guest in a youtube video talk like they're the host. Usually, in this kind of videos, the expert knows a lot about things. But can't explain it well. And the host needs to put in the hard work. Host is obviously an experienced youtuber who knows to ask the right questions. Like. The expert is a document, and the host is reading the document and explaining it to us dumbasses.  This guy is both knowledgeable, and knows how to transmit that knowledge to others...
Random thought: can the magnetic force fade/wear/break away?  If you take a possessively charged object one atom thick, suspend it, and touch it to a negatively charged object one atom thick in a vacuum or whatever proper conditions would be required, would the two objects eventually separate because one or both demagnetized?
Of course, the military uses metric, everyone does.
wow that guy LOVES his job 😀
youve done this before havent you?
this dude was so into it, i loved this video
I think when we have the conversion about Metric vs Imperial it's more revealing about why we haven't changed than we might realize. I'd have a wager that people tend to not like to be called stupid. So much so that they wouldn't want to change for anyone that thinks they're stupid?
Happy, is that you?
Weighing things by bouncing photons off the world's smallest diving board and measuring the jiggle.  Remarkable!
truly a kid at heart. such a passionate dude
I Love this dude :D
Imperial is not "freedom units", it's actually the very much opposite. To be one of the last countries in the world who still uses imperial system - that's some psychological cuckery for the long dead British Empire😏
Isn't kilograms based on an amount of  cubic water. I read that one litre of liquid water has a mass of almost exactly one kilogram, due to the gram being defined in 1795 as one cubic centimetre of water at the temperature of melting ice.
This guy you were talking to, awsome. Could imagine a day trip for the guy to schools or such.
Waouh Instrumentation brought to the extrem. When a person is passionate about a thing. It give this. Very instructionfull
Drinking game: drink every time they say ish
The thumbnail just changed while I was watching the video 🙂.... Made me think I was watching the wrong video 😂
Beautiful
How awesome is to hear someone really passionate about his job.
minicro
This guy is a national treasure, i love how much he enjoys his work.
The electrostatic balance and the silica micro sensor got me really interested. I started studying Micro and Nanoengineering this year, so its nice to see what kind of applications my field of study can have.
I love this dude i need to know more about him, internet please put this man on a podcast i think he is very interesting person
Ohh boy you might have hurt freedom unit defender's feeling
This was fun to watch
With tiny force comes tiny responsibility.
Just finished Physics 2 and now I understand this, im so happy
That was awesome
You cannot convince me that you didn't read pinecones first
Listening to people enthusiastic about their work is amazing!
omg one hour ago
It blew my mind to see how much money is spent on accurate standards. Building that lab deep underground, the high tech and intricate gear, and the intense physics that went into the design of a lot of that must have all cost a fortune!
This video is so gripping. This channel makes me fall in love with physics again. Thanks
Give this guy his own series! He’s hands down the best “science YouTuber guest” of 2022 :)
I still remember that old clip about the metric in US, that was quite a while ago isit? But this is so freaking awsome, that guy is so 'happy' to tell about this, by his voice alone you get totaly hyped about this whole concept of measuring something.. insane tiny.
Everyone should keep looking for a job until you feel like Dr. Gordon Shaw explaining his work.
130k views in under an hour? Y’all rolling in the cash 💵
The enthusiasm of this man is admirable!
Love the videos as always Derek, they never fail to get me excited about learning.
More of this guy 👏
Thank you. Makes me wonder how much a thought weighs?
derek is getting his time’s worth over there at NIST
Thumbnail changed lol
I think there is only 4 countries in the world that uses imperial units right? Anything dude, you should make your videos little bit longer if you can please.  Bcz we love them. Personally I do. Merry christmas and happy new year to you all.
Imagine some lint dropping off from the mic's dead cat.
This was a great watch. There's just pure joy on Dr. Shaw's face. I love to see and meet people like that. I'm curious, so when they figured out the method using planck's constant did they go back and see if the original weight was decaying or the replicas werer getting heavier?
"Little diving board" was so much understandable.
Any idea why they are not using fulcrum to standardize weights.. W1xD1 = W2xD2 .. should be simple right ?
I feel like he gave an answer to the question "why do we need to measure this precisely at this scale" with a bit of a mislead.  While we do have needs for some small measurements like he described, I think the realistic answer to why they are measuring multitudes smaller than the force needed to stretch DNA is more so two fold.  "To be out ahead of technology if we ever DO need to", and "because it's a cool challenge".    But honestly it seems this level of precision will never be needed in industry outside of lab environments for "pursuit of knowledge" since this force is so small, simply sitting in a room idle is likely experiencing many multitudes of these measured forces from ventilation alone.
This man gotta be family of Penn Jilette ... everytime I looked away i thought I was listening to Penn haha. (I was listening to laptop speakers tho)
The sensation felt when sunlight hits our skin can be measured as well
Thanks for sharing and Merry Christmas to you and your family 👪
Electrostatic force is better, no need to compensate for heat radiation energy loss from the electromagnets, ...or am I wrong in this????
Your question was worthy of the shaking of the orange balloon at you
Styropyro has entered the chat
10:05 that's what she said
Nice, now I can finally measure my life achievements! ... It's still 0.
@Veritasium very cool video👏Thanks for sharing 🙌
key tekaway: this guy loves his job
I remember in grad school there was a lab using optical tweezers and atomic force to measure the force that RNA and DNA polymerase exert as they extend nucleic acids, I think the forces were around  1-50 pN.  I remember wondering how they calibrated their scales.
This man is super professional, but I couldn't not compare him, to Gabe Newell. They have the same stature, they have the same gusto for the technology, and they both are just happy to learn more about the thing they discovered.
I really want to be friends with this guy!  He's awesome.
9:25 This is so lovely - a metrology nerd gets to show off his coolest toys to a friend and then the friend pulls out the very special lens (a toy in its own right) so that he *finally* as a picture he can take home to show what he works on. And I mean: This video will be a perfect introduction video to the public and new hires - or it becomes a time capsule in its own right as the lab in constantly upgraded.
Ready for the thumbnail and title to change several times now
That guy is awesome
Yes, have seen my local copy of the standard kilogram, it is only 10km away from me in it's armoured vault. Also have masspieces that are only 3 steps away from it, having been verified by a massmeter that was verified and calibrated with one of the sub masters compared to the local standard kilogram. 1g masspiece that is 1g with 4 zeros after it, any more and air pressure and bouyancy has an effect on it, which is why all those tiny measurements take place in hard vacuum.   The smaller masspices you cannot use in atmosphere, unless you measure your local air pressure and humidity, and compensate for the amount it bouys up the tiny masspiece, and, measuring that 100mg masspiece, simply moving your hand into view of the massmeter the IR radiation from your hand will make a change in the measurement.  Nice when the company coming in to do the verification uses your own masspices, simply because they have a fresher certificate, and they look at the long term drift and can see no trends, except for the one where it jumped up by 0.5g, which was because, a week before they went in, I took them stripped the paint off, and then gave them a new coat of primer and black, leaving a week in heat to flash off solvent. Yes also had the cotton gloves and wipe cloths, to make sure they stayed dust free and clean. The sub 200g ones had a separate box with the tweezers as well to handle them.
6:07 Stack of HP-3458A ;-D Not difficult to find at NIST, I suppose....
Watching veritasium's videos makes me realise that I will never be intelligent enough to fully understand the humour contained within Rick and Morty.
What is the air buoyancy factor in all this, and is it an issue?
As a 25 years old who's kinda bored about starting to actually work after studying I gotta say, I really hope I'll be able to find a job and career that makes me as passionate as this man. He truly is an inspiration to me, and I'm not exaggerating
We're living in a golden age of educational video's.
I'd love to watch this guy cut dovetails.
I think he is in the wrong job, his beard is a problem! :):):)
I love this topic
Another video I did not know I wanted. Thank you, sir!
0:40 Africa gets only one replica.......!
You guys are awesome 👌 👏 👍
What a fantastic guy!
Hey  Make video on what mass or spin actually is
How does a weight, that is handled with the biggest care, maybe loose or gain weight?
all I could think when he was leaning over to look at the microgram weight was "it would be really bad but really funny if he sneezed"
NoICE
that guy is awesome
I am really vibing off his energy
I could hear him talk about his work all day long! How passionate he is about it. A follow up of this video and the work they do is a must.
So 'Light' does have 'weight'.   Mr. Ward, did you hear that ?
Did ol boy have a cold during this vid?
there are no small jobs at the imperial Bureau of standards... a couple of very tiny standards though
Usually Derek will add his own explanation to improve upon theirs, but this guy really did a great job at explaining!
This man has such vigor and enthusiasm about his job, he’d make a great teacher with that kind of attitude. If everyone felt like this about their work the world would be a better place
This guy is awesome, would love to see a facility tour featuring him
to the Audience of this Video: make an estimation of the percentage of machinery and devices in this Lab with german origin .. ;)  Makes you understand the wealth of germany .
I thought about one-tenth with my eye and saw 1 microgram
6:47 still, there are some metal parts on non fixed part... so how do you handle small fluctations that happens over time like with the standard-kg ?
I wanna see them measure a laser pointer now...
this guy is SO COOL, how!?
7:21 Reminds me of community's room temperature room :)
wait, its all metric? *always has been*
I thought Baby Yoda is the Tiniest Force in the universe.
Facinating watching, Loved how he presented all the info with such excitement! incredible precission!
Love geeking out to stuff like this
Pretty much blue screened my brain when he started talking about the forces needed to stretch, not break mind you, but stretch DNA strings. That is wild! Gotta love science!
"..convert to... <freedom units>" 🤣
Dr Shaw reminds me of Dr R. Doug Helvering
Dear Americans. Don't be ashamed. Get with the metric program like the rest of the planet 🤦😂🤣
As a metrologist...every aspect of this subject matter was right up my alley!  LOL  I love the dude's enthusiasm for the subject matter!
All that effort gone to waste because it's not a clean room.
America is secretly metric, lmao let's go
That’s why you use an accurate scale for weighing drugs. Especially when it’s an expensive substance or the dose is very sensitive.
Not being on the metric system is not stupid. It doesn't make a difference. For every application in which the metric system is superior, practitioners already use metric. For the rest of the applications, it simply doesn't matter which you use, and so people use what they're used to, and that's perfectly fine. Miles or kilometers doesn't matter for 99% of normal human use cases. I've used both systems fluently in my lifetime and only in the lab do you ever really need the things metric does well (multiplication and division of units across several orders of magnitude).
after 3 hours of procrastinating on my Uni assignments I decided to start working, and I needed to start with watching a video about origins of english. I open YT and I see Veritasium uploaded new video. RIP Uni
More precision measurement videos please!
As interested I am getting in this topic, I am concerned now since you ended up reminding me of the Metrology course that I am gonna need to go through in the next sem. I hope it doesn't go too hard for me. XD
I consider the normal force is the most indispensable element when it comes to counting all sorts of forces
A truly passionate man.. I want to learn so much from Dr Shaw.
Planck constant goes brrr, everywhere and clouds my head in uncertainty! (Also, we mustn't forget its reduced cousin, which shows up on even more occasions than the original.)
"Powerful" video 💪
Man what a cool guy, not only is he one sharp cookie but he's just engorged with enthusiasm for his work. Kudos to that man!
I'm interested to see the next thumbnail he tries for this video. The current one is super basic and not clear what it means
What a guy !....cheers.
u found me
I see a Veritasium video, I click.
Dr. Shaw was a super cool interviewee, love his energy and wealth of knowledge.
Derek definitely made that guy's day. No one had probably shown such interest in those measurements before Derek did, which the guy is definitely very passionate about.
How can worldpeace be harder than this? Don't answer. It is a thought experiment.
I was sure this would be about measuring the gravitational constant.
I like those wires,  there like gage blocks for wieght .
Man I want to work there hahaha
So great seeing someone with such a positive energy towards his work. He’s such a good teacher as well. Bet he would be really memorable for a school/college trip.
This stuff blows my frigging brain 😳
It's not called freedom units, it's called Dungeon & Dragon Units (R) ;-)
What a nice guy. You can clearly see how much he loves his job and how excited he is to talk about his work. Gotta love passionate people like him. Much love!
What a great guy. Also, i was only listening at first with my phone somewhere on my desk, and when i checked the screen he looked exactly as i had imagined based on his voice
I have so many questions. Does classic physics actually works the same in these magnitudes? Is math still there? Omg
Can I ask you a question? Why the heck do you need to exist? lol
This guy has amazing on camera presence with his expressions and CLEARLY loves what he's talking about, amazing to see.
Photons are not massless IMO.  I’ve been saying since 2013 that it seems extremely (Occam's Razor) obvious that all electrons and all photons are in orbit with a dark matter particle and I’ve shared my theory literally many thousands of times with hundreds of the world’s top physics universities, professors, labs, channels, etc.  Based on Fermilab and other recent findings, I now more specifically think electrons are made of an electron neutrino entangled in orbit with a dark matter muon neutrino, explaining their erratic orbits around nuclei, superposition, uncertainty, the double slit, etc just like I’ve been saying since 2013.  I think photons are a pair of electrons entangled in orbit together in apparent axial or helical polarizable wave-like movement depending on the direction of their rotation as they travel.  This explains the double slit experiment for example and the speed of the rotation explains electromagnetic wavelengths (and visible colors, etc).
I could listen to a morning seminar from this man for hours and not be the slightest bit bored. His passion and knowledge are contagious and admirable!
thanks now i can add something to my tinder bio
What a great man, making tiny things.
Hey, I have never been so early. Let me think of a cool thing to say...hmmm... “Even the smallest person can change the course of the future.”. Here you go.
Really interesting and amazing!!!
I love this video's thumbnail.. Derek reacting to something tiny. Also partly feeling attacked
As a Brit, I love metric. But after recently learning the size of a yard and how close it is to meters I'm surprised it didn't become the standard unit. Like it would make conversion to Imperial so much easier for those who refuse to convert.  Like the average human is about 2 yards vs 1.68 meters.
The Doc is wary at first, then realises that Veritasium is much more n a pretty face and does, in fact, understand him… that’s when we get to see a happy professional scientist opening his world to us. Gorgeous experience!
Love this channel
Now show the energy vectors at work in the EFB.
Pls give us more such content!!
Fantastic passion!
Use better thumbnail
I love how passionate he is at explaining every detail, and how excited he is to answer the questions, must be so cool to work at something you actually love
This man looks so excited and full of energy to share his knowledge. Just like a kid waiting to get home to tell his parents what he learnt at school
give us graphical videos.
I couldn't work around those scales. Anytime I had a spare moment I'd start weighing random objects trying to guess the weight. Either I'd break the scales or never actually get any work done.
It's really amazing to see someone so excited about what they do. I love this.
"to freedom units" ahahahahahahah
damnnnnn Ver
@1:57 "wittle weights" :)
white people...
That's a geek who loves his job - kudos
06:38 him wearing a construction helmet in a lab tells you the kind of people scientists are 😂 Zero real world experience, skewed reality, living in a bubble. It’s beyond unnecessary
This guy loves his job and i love him for it, he made the video so much more interesting
these videos make my day
I'm so into discussions of the extremes, both at the smallest and largest scales of existence.
nice
When all your fav science channels upload on the same day
Derek thank you uploading 4 videos in a time span of a month. I absolutely love your videos. I've learned so much from you.
Great video, very interesting!
When I got general anesthesia a few months ago - last thing I remember before I went nighty was "I just gave him 150 micrograms of Fentanyl." Just shows the importance of accurate weight measurement.
Love the enthusiastic and passionate 'measurement' guy. He clearly loves his job AND wants to talk about it. Very very nice!
Love the passion of Dr Shaw towards science, he also looks similar to the guy who created Jurassic park in the movies
Derek, y'all rock!
the core of science, conceptually and practically..... the intersection
I don't know how Derek tracks down the most energetic people who can explain things so well on almost every video but hey, that's why I watch Veritasium.
Super nice guy. Thanks for the education.
That 10 μg made me feel like Avgn's nintendo world championship episode "Can i touch it" "Don't even look at it!"
I wonder what's the minimum force required to like this video.   For my mobile phone i think it's about 5 millinewton.
So cool. Please more videos like this, I think you can live from NIST cool stuff for a year :)
This dude is so excited to finally share his knowledge with someone who isn't working there. I can imagine how difficult it is to talk about your job, when this is your job. It's not exactly a topic that comes up at the dinner table. He looks so happy to explain what he does to someone interested in his job!
"If you get a speck of dust on here"  **Lifts a gigantic puffy microphone that definitely has at least 5 grams of dust on it**5
Damn 2x NIST videos?
that is not a very good thumbnail . the title is awesome tho
1:13 true YouTuber power move to keep that voice squeak in there, love it
Why was he holding that balloon? What got cut out?
With the last sensor, which measures based on moment of material based on laser beam, don't you think at that scale resonance frequency should be calculated?
Man the scientists studying the systems of train-based intra-urban   transport are going to be disappointed when they go to register the name of their discipline.
Man: Our country is not allowing metric system. He: Isn't that crazy??? Man: NO, THAT'S STUPID!  Thats exactly what I thought about USA at that moment.
This man made the video for you, a lot of passion coming off from him.
This is one of the most boring subjects in STEM but this man enjoys it!  good for him.
I love how veritasium calls them freedom units💀
What an interesting video. I love the passion you guys have. Thank you so much Veritasium!
Tiny measuring tape.
Imperial is just Metric with extra steps.
I want someday this man to take my interview on my innovation
You are great but here 0:39  you are using the wrong map of my INDIA
I though love was a tiny force?
This is the type of video that makes me think "Humans are amazing when they want to be", the thought that laser light pressure can be measured makes sense but then thinking how to actually do it is mind-blowing
This guy is so into his job, I love it.
NIST seems such an awesome place!
The knowledge gains, in an unbroken history of humans achieving new heights in accuracy, is almost unfathomable, who knows what we'll achieve next.
Awesome video and a wonderful presenter! Thanks for sharing!
the experts on the last two uploads have been incredible
For those wondering how we would calculate the force of a laser in theory, you just take the power of the laser and divide by the speed of light. For example a typical laser pointer might have a power of 1 to 5 milliwatts, which you divide by 3*10^8 m/s to get, indeed, a force in the piconewton range.
I'm always fascinated about how the experiment is done, It is always frustrating to me when in physics class you directly take the result from an experiment, sometimes is necesary to save time, but many times you learn much more by also telling how the experiment is done, even if is just in story form
There's no science without measurement, and no measurement without science.
Current title: "How to measure the tiniest forces in the universe"  It 100% isn't the same when you're reading this
His excitement is so inspiring
NiST wasn't so great at diagnosing Building Number 7.
As someone working the same kind of energy in my research field I kept smiling the whole video. Dr. Shaw has one of the best days in this life, he can share his knowledge with someone who is listening and is interested.  Thank you for making it possible to see it also! (Also best moment 1:00 ;) )
6:08 obligatory 3458As spotted
People being so excited about what they are passionate about and being really excited to share it with others makes me so happy
So at 9:16 min ,,why they put that 10micro gram in white background ,it would be easier to see that in black background..
How exicted Dr. Shaw was when Derek managed to take a picture of his 10 microgram weight
While I appreciate the trope, it's not stupid that most Americans operate from Imperial measurement. It's differently useful. Firstly, as stated, the US does, in fact, use metric. But many Americans know how to use both metric and Imperial. Imperial does have a couple interesting benefits going for it. For instance, when it comes to construction: Metric is easily divisible by 2, 5, and 10; Imperial is easily divided by 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. The fact that two more easy dividers exist makes Imperial a bit more useful in construction.   Metric, in and of itself, is just made up, too. There isn't some form of measurement handed down from the Gods that is better or worse, inherently. Just different.
I am not fat, I just have too many dust particles on me. 🥺🥺
The guy loves what he does you can tell.
wow this amazing
HAHA!!> Confirmed by a SCIENTIST, the USA imperial system is "stupid", This guy gets  a new life @ the start of the year.
"Man, I gotta tell you it was not easy" (measuring the 10 microgram bit).  The way he said it I'd be interested to know what was involved and how many times the guy must have cursed during the process  🤣
Damn that guy is amazing
Every video of metrologists I've seen they just seem like the coolest people
This topic is actually pretty cool to me as an electrical engineering student. We have a subject called "Instrumentation and Measurement in Electrical Engineering" which kinda opens your eyes on how difficult and complicated some measurements can be and how advanced some measuring techniques are with the instruments being reeeeally expensive.
May the force be with you - Femptonewton by Femptonewton.
Derek, can you do a video on the Rehbinder effect please? Seems interesting but there’s not much detail about it online
imagine our friend when he was creating the 10ug weight and losing the samples when retrieving them from the balance
That's very cool using a capacitor to measure force. I never would have thought of that! What I was thinking however was a box of tissues and electrical mass air flow sensors. Cheers 🍻
"When you realize the kilogram"  Rare, but correct use of the word!  Nice.  This word geek enjoys seeing that kind of thing.  Even better when it occurs in the wild.
in Germany we can make 1000 screws out of this raw Material ❤😂
Love being able to see lab setting i would never get to see irl
Dr. Shaw is somewhat reminiscent of the crazy scientist of Area 51 from the movie Independence Day. I guess NIST is quite area-51-ish itself.
The guy energy is 🔥🔥🔥🔥
They had to invent a new metrological method to measure my penis 🥲
Man I wish I had that passion to live. Great guy
This is so amazing, this channel is one of the bests in the world
The first gentleman could sell ice to the Eskimos. He is so enthusiastic about his subject matter. I could listen to him talk all day. Mind you, the whole vlog was enthralling to me. Brilliant channel.
I love this guy I could watch him all day!
I need to go to this lab to measure my pp.
I love when you interview people who are truly passionate about their work. This guy is excited about small forces, and it's super wholesome :)
Hey Derek! I've spent the last 20 years researching & teaching Quantum Physics at Stanford University. I must say, it gives me immense pleasure to see you pick up an interesting & complicating topic and then break it down into simple & comprehendible language! Great work!
you hardly can see 100 micrograms of pure crystalline lsd, i cant imagine trying to find only 10 micrograms
@6:38 that safety arrester for hydraulic arm is way advance
What I want to know is how the measurement devices themselves are made. What kind of equipment is used to manufacture things so minute.
This is pure explanation,very easy to understand..Thanks Derek for this wonderful video
Amazing. I really liked the large shiny machines :).
Nano-Heads
Love your videos, I studied Biology, but please stop showing dead animals as "collectibles", it is obscene, promotes others to collect and promotes to see wildlife as a mere commodity for our selfish and superficial entertainment. Ultimately it promotes extinction.  I am talking about the dead butterflies and other wonderful and beautiful beings that are at your background in many videos. They were killed for your "enjoyment". I am talking in general, I haven´t watched this video yet, but I will with great pleasure. Thank you for your excellent work.  Kind and intelligent people who agree with this please like the comment so Derek sees it. Thank you and let´s heal this beautiful Planet     🌏
lol I witnessed a thumbnail change, guess the algorithm didnt approve the first thumbnail. It was honestly kind of non descriptive though so I guess it was destined to fail
There's times where Derek tells the story, and very well too, but there's also times like this where he's experienced enough to stand back and let the compelling measurement expert do the talking. There's no singular "format" to a Veritasium video; whatever works best to get the story across is how a video looks in the end.
This guys great. Id love to follow him round and ask a million and 1 questions and I think he'd be happy to answer :)
Had to write the same as so many others before: Thanks to Dr. Shaw for his HUGE enthusiasm for TINY weights! (see what I did there...) Pleasure to listen to your explanations.
This guy is so much fun! It's incredible just how small the things get that they work with. He's so knowledgeable about so many different things involving such specific measurements. It's so nice seeing someone so invested in what they do, really makes you smile.
Blows my mind that an Laser Pointer could stretch an DNA String
LIGO anyone?!
Am I alone in thinking the 'Big Question" is 'why are you suddenly holding an orange balloon?'
For a guy who deals with weights of the order of milligrams, he is cautious and wears a hard hat.
Love Dr. Shaw's enthusiasm. Kept me deeply engaged throughout the video!
Wow that’s so interesting.. that engineer seems so proud of his work.. great video
Grandpa really love him job. I am so glad he chose this job. You can see a glow on his face while explaining the stuffs.
I adore his enthusiasm for his job, it feels like everyday is Christmas for him. So fantastic
"Freedom Units" LMAO
This man really loves his job, amazing to see!
I just want to be as passionate about my work as Dr Gordon is about his.
wow that's awesome. thanks for the videos
Listening to someone talk so passionately about something they love never gets old
this mf is so passionate don't need no edditing or cuts he carries it all on his own
Absolutely loved this video, caught, kept, and increased my curiosity. Thank you.
7:47 and now a word from today sponsor YouTube 😆
How do these companies that no ones heard of get the money to build these machines?
His excitement distracted me from listening :D Have to watch it again
I love Metrologoy!
Would this make it viable to use a laser as a sort of input device on a TV? I don’t mean Bluetooth and measuring the change in angles via an accelerometer or something - I mean would it be possible to put those detectors into the screen and have it be roughly compatible with *any* laser pointer
Notification 41 mins late
Using the imperial system is not stupid. The metric system is great for small units such as anything less than about 8 to 12 inches, but anything larger than that and the imperial system works better. I'm American and I regularly use the metric system for small measurements and I use the US imperial system for everything else.
This is perhaps the most down to earth and personable scientist you’ve ever had on. He reminds me of my constitutional law professor back in uni. Laid back, intelligent, open, but yet very serious about his craft.
Really loved the guy! Nice vid
So this is basically an advanced capacitive touch screen but without the screen?
This man waited his whole life for this moment. To share his knowledge. Hoping one day some one will come and ask him about what he does. The excitement in his eyes is high.
As a teacher I would play one video of Veritasium per week to thr class. So interesting
A femtonewton is just about the amount of attraction women have towards me.
1pico Newton ^= DNA Molecule 1femtoNewton^= Laser Pointer, right!
i was searching their job postings way before this excellent video finished. Had the pleasure of working with, and learning from, a similarly passionate Plant Supervisor once. Miss him
Hello to any and all metrology tech's in the military 82-90 Navy O7
Such a cool video!
This is another trademark veritasium BAD THUMBNAIL
I am wondering if the original 1kg definition is getting heavier or not.
I love how this channel highlights people who are very passionate about what might seem like the most boring jobs ever.  It just shows you never know what you might find your passion in.
If Planck's Constant is measured in Joule seconds, which is itself derived from SI base units as 1 Js = 1 kg*m^2/s, then why can we use it to define the kilogram? Isn't that a cyclical relationship where Planck's Constant depends on the kilogram, which depends on Planck's Constant?
I think without love and obsession for what you do, those steps can feel unbearable. If you love what you do deeply and are obsessed with it... being uncomfortable is not even that bad. By the way,this man seems to be loving his work,it clearly reflects on how he is explaining things..
This ponytail guy is hilarious!!!
Science is bloody amazing. I’ve always hated it when I was young.
Wow I never realized that measuring the force of a laser beam happens like this. I've been learning this in class and this is really inetresting.
this thumbnail needs a change. great vid as always.
stretching out a molecule is a action i never thought about performing - and it amazes me
"Freedom units"? more like dumb units  amiriteee??? XD
I am most envious of their constant temperature.
If we were taught this way we would already be a type 1 civilization.
His enthusiasm is great! So contagious!
Bruuhhhh, so many bots 💀
Dustin from smarter everyday his father measures stuff as well. He was working for the James Webb.
I am so happy the "freedom units" has caught on! XD
So why did the cylinders diverge in weight over time...?
As an English graduate engineer, never was metrology so interesting. You can measure the force of a laser pointer?? What an interesting and passionate guy. 👍
Fascinating
This stuff is pretty cool, some elegant solutions to a very weighty problem.  Well, I tried.  So like a hydrogen atom being driven into a test apparatus at very low velocity under yocto gravity, right?  Also, it is all relative, because compared to the forces two one billion sun mass black holes would impart on each other at impact, EVERYTHING is a tiny force, I expect. Just sayin'.    Tiniest times and lengths are much more easily measured.   I love how these fundamentally based units make things so much more intuitive, specified numbers of the wave lengths of certain atomic photon emissions for lengths, and all that.  Yeah, I'm in a mood this morning.
Get this guy his own TED Talk ASAP.  And make it 90 minutes long.
It's not about the size of the weight, it's how you use it. It probably has a great personality, too.
this guy is just too good.
Youtube really doesn't want me to watch this, it doesn't show up on my sub feed or on this channel's page
I want to comment first HAHAHA why is thumbnail  have nothing to do with the title HAHA but anyway ill still watch it tho
This guy is incredible. I totaly would like to make a DnD game with him
I thought the second was defined by the vibration of a cesium atom. Did that change?
thank you
I love the passionate commenters in this video about the passionate researcher.
The best people are those whose eyes shine when engaged with that which they are a passionate about. I like this guy.
I always enjoy the topics Veritasium covers
I love to see that guy so passionate, it feels like you just let him speak and he told you all his secrets xD
Veritasium interviewed a damn Viking lol
If you liked this I think you will also enjoy the documentary "Precision: The Measure of All Things" by Marcus du Sautoy
We have a SIP measurement bench that the metrology lab uses to certify all our shop gauges. It get's calibrated once a year by SIP and it will give you 0.00000 level accuracy. As good as needed for most manufacturing processes. Compared to this thing in the video, that's like a tape measure vs a micrometer. A level of magnitude more accuracy. Impressive
Ishhh
we like to achieve big things now we can achieve small things
“It kind of looks like a hair” lol that’s because it is 😂
hello xqc, enjoy this video xqcL
When I worked for a "Nutrasutical" (Health Focused Supliments) I was in charge of Calibrating all of the Milligram (0.1g) and Kilogram (1.0-250.0) Scales in the Weighing Department. Sadly 20 years ago, there was ALOT of variations of results based on how much time I was given to perform this task... And the environments where not very consistant with debris and airflow. I "tried" to be "as anal as possible" with my calibrations, but Management was "tight"!
I absolutely love how passionate this guy is about his work! It is truly a joy to see someone that really loves his work, and is clearly proud of it.
Imagine that you can say with confidence that you had sucessufully  measured the force of a laser beam. If you find this average then you are either crazy or you are the guy from the lab 😂😶. Amazing video ;)
Hey Derek your "original double slit experiment" video helped me a lot in my studies ( class 12th) . Thanks mam 👌🙏
滚蛋滚蛋滚远点🤔🧐
Where's HL3 Gabe?
梦婷姑，沙拉酱黑妹不错，母的🤔🧐
This idea that the US is "actually metric" is the stupidest notion ever. You're going the wrong way. We adapted our units to SI for globalization. They are not "actually" different units. It's not even a pedantic argument, it's just wrong. Units are not "actually" what they are currently defined by; they are literally just an idea that represents a standard measurement. A foot is "actually" a foot regardless of what arbitrary method we use to reckon that length.
I love how passionate he is about the subject matter.
I love how Veritasium delves into some unknown fact of life and simplifies it so that we can understand it and enjoy watching about it.
I think your "roundest object" video about trying to replace Le Grand K was the one that got me to subscribe to your channel.
Very cool. Clearly explained and edited.
Am i the only one who thinks he sounds a bit like Paul Rudd?
It's crazy that this lab doesn't appear to be a cleanroom. Seems like dust contamination would be a major problem for their measurements.
I love everything about this video. Please please please do more of these insider interviews with scientists and engineers in high tech labs!
Did we finally get a unprofessional thumbnail 😂
某听古刹那间🤔🧐
“Feel the force!”– Yoda
I love the enthusiasm of this scientist!
"I have measured the force of a laser beam hitting something" is maybe one of the most rare achievements one can get.  I never thought that this would be possible. Absolutely amazing.
- Yeah, if you're asking why precise theoretical definition of kilogram is so important just go watch Veritasium video  - Ok... Which one?  - pretty much anything at this point. It's everywhere :D
If small dust can change the weight, do you need to wash your feet before you use them for measurement if you wanna use inferior scale system? :D
I love how passionate he is at explaining every detail, and how excited he is to answer the questions, must be so cool to work at something you actually love
This man looks so excited and full of energy to share his knowledge. Just like a kid waiting to get home to tell his parents what he learnt at school
This video is amazing.
O车有毛的吗🤔🧐
These ideas in the future will hit something magical :)
The NIST guy sounds like  cartoon moose, and I love him.
"May I ask you the big question?" Asks the small question 🙄
1:06  the uncertainty if its "10's of parts-per-billion" should be 10's of nanograms not micrograms, or did i miss sth? so its a billionth of a kg and thats a millionth of a gram
It would be great if you can create video about smallest measurement of gravity (for detecting hidden dimensions)
I wish I was as happy as this guy about his job... I'm just blown away ...thank you🤗
most precise-ish lol
This dude loves his job, and it's awesome!
But to measure a cup of water for coffee?! I don't know what 20℃ is and I don't care. *_The less like Europe America stays, the better for the entire world._* As a born and bred American with a variety of bloods in my veins (I don't hyphenate my nationality), when I go to the store to buy a pound of flour, that's what I'm gonna ask for, period. That guy's (not Derek) metric snobbery crack ("it's stupid") is crass and elitist. I fully agree with using the metric system where tolerances have to be extremely rigorous, like building space vehicles and bridges, of course. Otherwise, get off my back.
Now y'all must be wondering the weight of a single sperm cell after watching this video. Don't.
That explainers enthusiasm really gave this video the special boost 💯
This one is a five thumbs up.
You're like sunshine on a rainy day.
Do scanning tunneling microscopy next! It can visualize electron clouds
The guys passion about his work is amazing to watch. The world needs people like that in order to achieve what he's doing.
Dr. Shaw looks like he really enjoys his job and explaining it to others!
I want more of this guy! He is so excited about his job and it makes me excited!
This man is a hero. Thank you for giving him a spotlight.
Wow that paper clip  weighs as much as a gram of coke
well that was short
I love the cadence at which you pump out videos lately whilest keeping the quality so high. :)
震惊这个视频竟然能翻译成中文🤔🧐
such a cool guy :'D
Doctor: You know, like when you stretch out a strand of DNA Derek: haha WTF Doctor: yeah, so about a factor of a thousand less than that
Is that Ben Brode's father?
So which weighs more? A pound of bricks or a pound of feathers?
I used to measure stuff where a slight draft in the room would ruin accuracy. This guy is several orders of magnitude beyond that.
If the kilogram is in a vault in Paris, does that mean I’m stealing it every time I weigh something?
The topics are so interesting after the synchronicity topic, nice
I’m curious how they even fabricated these items to measure against
Why doesn't 1 liter of water define the kilogram?
so the 5 sided one is 500 mg and the 4 sided ones are 200 got it
tip: don't put scary science stuff at the beginning (i love your vids)
Why here the earth's centripetal force which is caused due to rotation  acting on object is not concidered here. So that it may decrease the weight of the known standard object to some kind of micrograms. Here you can't say the accurate weight of an object while it is measured at different altitudes
Really liked this episode in large part to the gentleman in maroon. Explains things rather simply and sounds passionate about what he works on. Appreciate the content!
They measure the force that applies to an object after its hit with a photon?! Man this is some another level stuff
Fun Fact - Femto Newton. The amount of force I applied to cleaning my home today, which freed me up to watch this video.  :)    Observation: For a man (who is obviously passionate about the accuracy of his tools) he sure does have a lot of hair.  Can't imagine the conversation with his boss, when they discovered a long grey hair in the equipment :)
People like this Dr Shaw are just so freaking cool....
"His 2nd reason" Most of general public doesn't get that ,that is how science and maths works A smaller step in pushing the frontiers of our understanding of universe and achievements can be immensely important gor may be something like quantum revolution a century later.....like chain reaction.And eventually getting the whole Humanity to next level.
Femto newtons are my favourite kind of newtons, because they are cute as heck.
I like how he described 1 pico Newton as the force needed to stretch DNA at 10:41
That is the face of a man that loves science. I feel that he got his dream job.
"Yes, it's stupid" I like this guy :D
I thought this vid would be about like the weak and strong force in atoms
Yes you heard it from a US scientist, anything other than the metric units is STUPID!
Doesn't the  de Broglie wavelength start to mess with super small measurements
This guy was so fun and excited to share his knowledge loved it
guy seems so cool. Really passionate about his work and explaining it to others.
wonderful
I see “10 micrograms” and my first thought isn’t physics 😅
"Our country is actually metric." Phishh dont make me laugh.
This guys saying "ish" makes me a little bit nervous.
Damn was this electromagnetic scale measuring based on Planck's constant badass or what? Amazing video, thank you very much!!
Derek never disappoints!
Finally some weights for my chest press routine!
1:10 says "tens of parts per billion" but should say million. Just a heads up and feel free to delete this. Love your videos!
Very interesting. When Canada went to the metric system, I thought "Great! That will make it easier to compare prices on goods." Ha! The machinery did not change so we have weights of goods such as, 398 gram,  272 grams, 352 ml, 118 ml etc. It is so ridiculous. Surely it can't be that complicated or expensive to recalibrate the machinery or adjust  packaging. Maybe it's to confound us
That guy loves his job more than anyone I've ever met, and I've met some pretty rich, powerful and/or famous people.
I've seen most of your videos but, for me at least, this is one of the most interesting ones, maybe because i study mechanical engineer and i know about this subjects in depth. Thank you!
It's funny how just 120 Micrograms can really fu*k you up :) That's the real force hihi
The excitement of the lab worker when you got the smallest weight on camera tho
What is the worlds smallest sneeze?  Picochuu.
The mile and the second are universal measurements, not the kilometer. This is proven by Pythagorian tuning, in vibrations per second, the notes define the distance to the sun and moon in miles.
His joy when you capture the 10mug-weight is just amazing. Imagine having someone being able to measure such tiny forces to that precision being genuinly excited by someting as mundane as a macro-lens :D  Honestly, I love that guy and I don't know what to compliment you more on for: teaching the world about metrology or showing them how there are scientists that are actually genuine, likeable and very friendly-minded people.  Awesome - thank you very much!
This guy was amazing! Bring him back for more please :) loved learning about Metrology
Great job
this guy seems like a wonderful person. His explanations are great
The USGS measured Absolute Gravity in this lab..right under this chair. Points at the scratched floor with his feet.
Man that weights ( especially that 10microgram one ) must have taken a hell lot of Accuracy and hard work
WTF are these bots in the comments? hmmm...
hello veritasium fam
What a mesmerising video! I didn't even know human being can measure weights this small!
Wow, it's unbelievable that they measured so small weights and forces. Great video, Veritasium!!
I love this content you keep on providing. Quality YT channel, highly appreciated!
7:55 it's painful to watch either a professional mentioning the wrong unit of gravitational force or a professional editing out the correct unit of gravitational force at the wrong time.
Back to back uploads, we are blessed. Thanks Derek.
How do you even get these interviews wtf I'm jellh
What a great guy, he seemed very passionate about his work.
This guy is so passionate about his work and it's very inspiring. This is an awesome video! Thank you for this!
This is a fantastic video! I love when people are so enthusiastic, DR Gordon Shaw, you have a very inspirational way of telling :)
that tumbnail is from ohio or something, scary as a tiger in the night
what a great guy Dr Shaw is!
This is indeed insightful in more ways than one. We appreciate your dedication and commitment somehow.
It IS stupid that we convert from metric standard lol I'm with him
Are quantum field just methametical identity like space-time fabric?
I love how excited this guy is about units, made the video really entertaining
I need somebody to talk to me like this man talks about weights.
wait, you mean other humans can't feel a femtonewton's difference with their fingertips? pffft, weak!
veritasium
"freedom units" ahaha that killed me
For someone that enthusiastic about small weights ... he sure is fat
I've loved these NIST/Metrology videos
everyones teacher taught us that sound needs medium to travel right. imagine u are talking to someone and suddenly u starts waving your hand in front of your mouth now thats type of motion should create disturbence in the medium but in reality it wont affect the quality of sound how???
i love how a video that was uploaded 1 minute ago has over 100 comments about how good it is :)
this guy weighs 1 ton and shakes like my grandpa but he's out here weighing femptograms
When your brother in law tries to tackle you in family football and veritasium makes a video about the forces applied.
Got 2 minutes in, already a blast
Hahah, I always think how when you have to go 'deep underground and in a completely climate controlled area' you know you are do precise science.
OOoHhh yEaH spEcIaL LeNs
it's crazy how little we know about a known quantity like a kilogram
5:18 cute squiggle
I was just thinking about this very same question when it showed up in my recommendations! Thank you for uploading this!
I usually only use a ruler. Does its job.
Amazing
As long as I get something close to 8 grams when I buy a quarter ounce of weed, I,m not too fussy
Gordon's a cool guy
Such a great episode, loved it. It is stunning to me that we as a species can measure these almost unimaginably small forces.
I guess it is about time to stop being secretly metric
Absolutely fascinating.
Lol, they're worried about fingerprints and specs of dust and yet they spit all over the weights as they talk... 😆
Your best thumbnail yet!
I would be a great physicist if you were my physics teacher!
How do they calibrate the scale that weighs the KG?
Hey how did they know I was watching a Veritasium video
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."     -John 3:16 God gave us his only son Jesus Christ who Lived a sinless Life then died on the cross to endure our punishment, he rose again on the 3rd day and is currently seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty.   We have all sinned against the Perfect and Holy God that gave us Life, we all deserve the Punishment of Hell for our sin/rebellion against him.  We have all Broken the Moral Law in our Hearts, even if you don't believe in Jesus, or have never heard of him or the Law of Moses or the Bible, you are still sinful and on your way to Hell. But the GOOD News is that Jesus Christ took our sin upon himself on the cross and shed his Blood as payment for our Sins.   He took our Punishment and gave us his reward of Eternal Life in Heaven  Jesus is returning to Judge the world soon my Friends  When Jesus Christ returns, he will take his children home, and hundreds of millions of people will disappear in a brief moment! When you see this event take place, please remember these words, and understand that the Rapture has just taken place! Please remember that the Christians tried to warn you of this coming day, and that God is real, and his name is Jesus Christ!  Please Repent and believe in his sacrifice and Love for you, believe in him as your Lord and Saviour, and you shall be saved.  "And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be." Revelation 22:12  May God Bless you all with wisdom and hope during these dark times!  The END is truly upon us my Friends!  REPENT!
So K20 is THE mass standard for the US, and it's labeled with a red Dymo label "K20"?!? (at 0:45)
And yet we still can't measure the size of the average male defeater.
My question is, what is the real storyline to why the US won't change to the Meter or gram standards 🤔
Freedom units 😁🤦
5 minutes released and already this many comments thats insane.
NOOOO That is *NOT MEASURING* ... it is called CALCULATION... based on ASSUMPTIONS of Eternal-Universal-Immutable Laws (EUI Deities) ..... We cannot measure gravity in Andromeda (neither in the Mesozoic).... Cannot make AMS for isotopes in other galaxies.... or in the past.... and so on... You might call it Religion (Faith) if you wish...
I met a 2022 Nobel laureate in physics, Alain Aspect! It was super interesting.
You know the day's gonna be a sciency one when Veritasium uploads a video.
Not much views till now . Hurry up change title and thumbnail 🤣
Comment in the first 5 minutes of a veritasium video!
Funny when he said America is on the metric system but they apply an conversion. It’s crazy.
I love the Star Wars hidden reference at the beginning!!
What’s Darth Vader favorite measurement system? .... .... .... .... .... The Imperial System

Honestly after finishing my Enginneering degree these videos just make more sense and pique my intreset having the basic understanding of some concepts of these videos makes it all the more better.

Watching this while in physics class 👌
Can i get a complete video about wave motion in more intuitive way
We aren't going metric in everyday life....so quit the snark.
