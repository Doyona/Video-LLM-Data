The water is not doing it either my dude actually the water was doing worse than the soda was what you should do is set up like a lemonade stand or something like that where you make something and people come to you just like how they were coming to you when you were just standing still imagine having a lemonade stand or something that they see from afar and they come to you but seriously the water is working worst in the soda is I would not do the water

I think they’d buy the soda if it was cheaper. $2 for water seams more reasonable than $2 for a can of soda. If it was a bottle of soda they’d buy it. Smart choice to go with water

RYAN I’M BRYAN RYAN.😂😂😂😂😂 7:36

ryan just is the type of guy to get the good out of everything
This man is literally selling water at 1600% profit😂😂😂 .He bought it for 16¢ and is selling for 2$😂😂
THIS IS MADE ON MY BDAY🎉🎉🎉
Bro the 49ers fans after 2024 super bowl

how to get money in 30 days
“One word, burrito time”
good morning sleepyheads
PLEASE  I know this series is over, and was over two years ago    BUT I AM LITERALLY BEGGING YOU, PLEASE BUY SOME SUNSCREEN
What do you do with the money when the great reset happens
You are doing amazing work, but one question. WHERE DOES THE CAMERA MAN GO TO SLEEP
gyatttt ohio
I remember having to wait every day just to watch’s this series
"RYAN I'M BRYAN RYAN" - green Glasses dude
Sheesh! Imagine a burrito being $6.84!
i hope you do something like this again this summer. me and my brother enjoyed watching this so much everyday
ChEeRs 😂
0:20 is wild what he doing
Crazy how Ryan could have just sold literally water for four days and bought a plane ticket to Raleigh
Thanking God with 3deepbreaths! Namaste.
Jai Shri Lakshmi. Awesome content. :) Let;s jive!
Wow 100 bucks in one day!?!?
This is my dream
It’s amazing how u do this bro!
How can you so easily return used coolers to Rite Aid? Oh, yeah! That's probably why they filed for bankruptcy in October 2023.
6:58  blud looks like Zach King
9:21 he didn't slap the Burrito!!!!!!
I’ve watched this series 4 times and the cooler strat is so OP
I went to antartica in 90 days
He’s so nice I would love to meet him!!!
10:10 it was not 2.1 seconds it was 5.
it surprises me that youtubers like this only have like 15k or 20k subs
Cool
Bros all videos are about pennies
I hate the background music
How did he get a $6 chipotle burrito tho????
TOMMY
8:45 ive ran over pedestrians on this road in gta
This guy is so nice
He’s so awkward in a good way he is such a good YouTuber
I might do the great reset
6:42
Bruh That was 5 seconds anyways i dont kare
You are the GOAT❤
I didn’t think it was possible to be both charismatic and awkward at the same time but here we are!
@jordanbelfort you got to interview this guy for your show. So funny seeing it in action like the icees back in the day.
I was in Arizona in october
Like how he's not mad about people not buying the things. Good job from Canada!🇨🇦
Rewatching this series 2 years later
MRWHOSETHEBOSS!!!!!
i donated. 50
Honestly couldn't imagine myself doing this. He's so brave 😭
If you sell prime in Canada, you’ll make a lot of money we go crazy for prime
i have a microscope
LETS GO WATER
goodmoring it's time to go to sleep
No 4 words one word burrito time
8:56  Ryan: one word, burrito time! 🌯 Me: thats 2?
CHEERS
2:30
This is one of the best video’s  that I’ve ever watched ❤
😅😅😅
this whole thing made me so thirsty!
In 2024 I'd love to see Ryan do this, but he needs to visit all 50 states to beat the challenge.
Minecraft with da Boyzz belike :
omgggg WHEN HE SAID THE SIGN GOT WHIPLASH I DIED SO BADDDDD HELP I REWATXHED IT AND REALIZED HE MEANT HIM BUT ITS SO FUNNYYSYSJWJS

When dee amogus is sus
Man buys water and sells it with at 40 x price
Somehow, this guy just earned all his money back in like less than two hours
7:56 you say you emo next minute you say your really happy.
Should have used the hammock to block the sun.  The last water from the cooler to cool down.
why not keep the cooler to store his hamock and his other "essentials"
🎉
Watching now
3seconds
every year i will watch this masterpiece of a series.. :D
it’s funny how cringey his sale skills are
is it me or is 108 dollars for a couple hours of walking around selling waters pretty dope return on investment?
he still needs to buy sunscrean
Someone pls tell me pls🥺🥺🥺
What does la stand for
This episode was on my b-day🎉! this was an awesome late birthday present!
10:37 thanks, calmed me down
A big question where do u poop
Great video
Why is he so awkward
hi
Ryan, where the hell did that bike lock come from? Hmmmmmmmm🤨🤨🤨
How dose he use the toilet 😮
What’s a penny
Why don’t homless people just do this
I <3 this video
Ryan is the most awkward but the most entertaining person ever
The next city is Las Vegas
You even thought about jumping on a trampoline and eating a apple on the beach with your toes on the side? Jus asking
7:06 sussy ryan
Doesn’t he have a door dash job ???????
Let’s go Tommy
What if he jumps a red light
I don't know about returning the coolers.
amigo sos un capo
The Kroger Usage is amazing
Bro called me sleepy head right after I yawned wtf bro
Ryan showing us how to keep on the grind.  In a way he’s showing you with the right attitude and dedication you can get anywhere coming from nothing.
This guy is so positive, he makes me smile in every video
Love how you raise for America 👍
It took you 5 seconds to eat it not 1.5 seconds
You are an inspiration
SLAP THE BURRITO!!!
Your my fav youtuber just get into special FX
no wonder the sodas were so cheap no one drinks them lol
Only Ryan Trahan fans can like this comment
MORE like 8 secondes
Also from Scotland still watching series for the 4th time love you guys!!!!! 🥵🔥☀️🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿😂
Okay but can we just appreciate how fast Ryan can eat?
"RYAN IM BRYAN RYAN" 😂😂😂
Like dis comment😊
So we not gonna talk about the stain on ur pants?
i love your vids!
10:40 I joined
:)
Did anyone notice that the center of his eyes were red at 13:00
Its next year, u dont need to wait! Did anyone forget to watch the SERIES
I am a big fan. I love you I want to meet you.
good vidio
"It feels great to breathe." Nah Really
Nice seeing the value of money on display. Good work my man 💪 from start to finish a smile on your face
Lol, “ I’m so emo right now”.   -Ryan Trahan
4.5 seconds for eating the burrito
Interesting
Broooo😂 is that the rock? 5:30
Why u say the dogs look fun
Is he gonna get the bike on the bus
Ryan has probably increased mcdonald's sales by a lot
10:04 look for the purple shirt😂
Ryan being awkward in short moments throughout the video just feels like a video connected with lots of Vines y'know?
7:59 *_YASSS_*
I woke up
Alr I’m gonna fall asleep
I am dehydrated right now but I’m in me bed and I don’t have a water bottle can you sell meh a water Ryan pls I’m so thirsty
💀
It took you 5 seconds to eat the borrito Ryan
returning the cooler? what is the retailer supposed to do with the use cooler? -- Only in USA this is possible.
I just started watching Day1 a few days ago
He’s so happy and nice to everyone 😊
9:35 Los Angelese lol
Ummmm.  Love Ryan.  But returning the cooler?  Cheating.  Twice.
my life is a lie
Perhaps a Cooler, cheap alcoholic beverages / beach walk and sell at a 1.5/2X profit margin 🎉(I’m sure I’ll inspire someone to try this method, good luck for whatever you may earn ❤)
So selling water in the street > doordash, noted.
2 bucks is a lot tho
This video makes me thirsty
Lot of 49ers fans I respect it
i love this!
Day 3 and he ALREADY has more money then me XD
Bro was the start of inflation 🫡
The people that give at least 5 more dollars are amazing
I love how he is so nice and awkward but am I the only one who saw a hair on that burrito
A true triumph of the human spirit
0:01 welcome tumed viewrs
5:14 bro is making money like crazy
2:50 bro is making massive minus profit
Jio9uh
Hey, wait a second, at 8:48 he just gets 30 dollars randomly
i am a subscriber
make a video in pakistan
Gùĺp Ģùĺp Gůļp
ur amazing 4 this how did u do that
Pure curiosity - what’s your thought process behind wearing a dress for the thumbnail?
i love how you have the warmest smile and say she said thank you it make my  heart melt
Selling water was much effective than doordash
The music is so good
This video is so exiting!
Ok, so if he can make $100/day selling water on the beach … how long would it take to buy a plane ticket and end this saga?
ZAMNNN 😍😍😍
WhEn I sAy PeNnIeS yOu SaY sErIeS
The thumbnail 💀💀lol
should've put 2$ instead of 2.00
9:12
Sorry but when you where eating the burrito from chipotle it was 5.8 seconds
The "YESSS!" At 7:57 Got Me Rollin' On The Floor  🤣
I would buy a water
I love watching Ryan and he may be my favorite YouTuber but the amount of awkwardness that he goes through is crazy 😂
Love you man! 😀
My favorite part is THE GREAT RESET
4:55 why the hell are they wearing hoodies on a beach??
How Ryan says thank u so much😂
Hey Ryan tomorrow is my birthday and it would mean so much to me if you could shout me out on day 7 of the euro challenge, but if you don't want to you don't have to love your vids and keep on doing them ❤❤❤
Imagine that cooler was the same as the one in the first video
I love how ryan says that he doesn't have any change but he just got 3 ones from the Dollar Store.
Did they color grade his sunburn away or is that just a super power to go to sleep a lobster and wake up bronzed?
I love the content it’s just so good
How can you return something used??
bro i love ur vids
Hey ever since this video I have gone on a bike for 1 year because u inspired me to work hard for the goal no matter how hard or easy it is and I going to carry on for 2 years and on this day next year I will give an update for the continuing journey
Howdy!
what do you do with the money when you get the great reset
SAME DAY IN 2023
SAME DAY IN 2023
That penny from day 1 has 11,075x more value
You should do a Mega Reset if someone donates $1M that restarts you at your starting location at the beginning of the challenge
The best part of his videos is that he is so sweet and kind to strangers even if there not nice to him It’s so wholesome  ❤😊
1:13  what is memorial day
I asked Ryan Trahan to come to Australia and try this challenge for 30 days - Day 3
Get a job
I wish this is how u made money. So fun
Me: sees Ryan doing this challenge Also me: “mom do you have a penny?”
You should try to get from Seattle to Miami
R u allowed to return stuff uve used in America?
people fro LA are called Angelinos.
is this day 3 or day 4?
“Oh yeah..gulp GuLp gUlP☺️”
7:21 , that guy is my gym coach...
yo thats cool keep it up ryan (even if im like 2 years late)
“I’m so emo right now” 😂😂😂
Sui
He didn’t slap the burito 😭 hi from 2023 Its 2024…..
This is how many people subbed to Ryan ❤ 👇🏼
OP
Man I love the energy of this guy, I'm a subscriber now 🙌
Thank you for making such amazing videos. God bless you
I cant believe it's already been a year! The nostalgia hits me hard, I watched every vid of the series. Now you're doing one with a Euro!
crazy that water and soda are now 2 dollars
You Sleepyhead
This is the best series ever! I keep re-watching it.
see, i can tell when someone is faking a journey or something like this, but u dont even need to watch his videos to know that he aint faking and he really made a connection with all of us. bottom line is ryan is one of the best loving and caring person and youtubers i watch. so keep up the good work and thank u for posting such good content 👏 👌 ❤
If you think about it he could pu money on a card and if the great reset happens he owns/has the card. If that could work idk.
Isnt Ryan trahan a lovely flower!!🔥🔥🤪🤪👨🏼‍🦲👨🏼‍🦲
7:36 “Ryan, I’m Bryan Ryan” had me in tears
Ryan could sell me literal trash lmao he's so convincing and charismatic it's awesome
At 13:04 his eyes go red
People are like: Oh god, this guy again, will he just ever stop selling drinks? 2:50
Hes not scared of socially akward, Socially akward is scared of him
Why are still buying the cooler and returning it for money?
That guy is probably confused why you keep on buying the The cooler and then returning it
How the hell is chipotle under 7 bucks
Bro I was trying to breathe and you just scurried across my screen making me wheeze laughing 10:51
The hair 😂😂 (no hate) 10:07
keep up the good work
W vid
Watching this series and this is so amazing
Has anyone ever wondered what Ryan does with the money when the great reset happens
Ryan: "Y'all, I'm going to eat this burrito in 2.1 seconds." Proceeds to eat burrito in 5 seconds
Bro looks like a tomato 🍅🤣🤣🤣🤣
I can help with the translation if necessary! I seriously hope this gets an official dub
Bro this is so nаstаlgic. 😉
Life is good I’m gonna eat this burrito -Ryan Trahan 2022
I LIKE RYAN
You should go across canada
A
bro use the bike lock cord to tie the cooler to your bike and pull the cooler with your bike
lets go Tommy🤜💪
1 year sheesh
Is been a year I am watching this again
who are you donating my penny to?
2:10 yall I love that money music thing budaboom boom lol😂
Let’s goooo 😂😂😂😂
Ryan never fails to make me laugh 😂 😆 😹 😹 😹
I love his videos 😊
Imagine he hits $99.99 and then the great reset happens that would be so frustrated
My guy is gonna have a sick tan when it’s all said and done 🤣🤣
You all can learn a valuable lesson from him. Being awkward doesn't have to be awkward if you are confident with it
Ur so freaking awkward it’s funny lol 😂
you should have got some of those flavor packets for the water that they could have bought for an extra 0.50 I did it before it WORKS SO WELL
honestly ryan is so down to earth, one of the most amazing youtubers I would say <3
I would not be able to do this challenge. I am not a social person and if I see candy, I’m broke.  Love ur vids keep up the good work.  P.S. u are not as awkward as I am, I see a person, I’m out
Wow
7:59 YÆS
14 MILLION meal have been donated! You have made a massive difference in the world with one series! Much love! ♥♥
איפה מס הכנסה איפה
only giga MEN bite the gum 3 times before fully putting it in their mouth
Eating the burrito took 9 seconds
im rewatching the videos i just realized that said im so emo rn 😭
8:54 BURRITO TIME
Love this peace 1:11
5:01 gta 5 players have seen that before
I love how people are so generous and giving him tips 🥰 Also him not disrespecting anybody from not buying from him 😊 And I find it crazy how he returns the cooler 😅😅
so he only ate once after walking around all day?
Do you really need a job when you could do this for a living
thats funny because im doing the same thing
Weird to think these videos came out a year ago I remember waking up and watching his new day I’m currently rewatching the series
He ate the burrito in like 5 seconds not 2 😂
people are struggling on the streets and this man is pulling money out of his A$$
Watching this series for the 5th Time love this series
9:29 HE DIDNT SLAP THE BURRITO! Nooooooooo.        Btw I know this was before it became a thing, just sayin
when he talks about selling his bike his eyes are red
50s
comes to show you can make more money selling water than on doordash...
Nobody:  Ryan: YES
I can't believe this was a year ago
I am re-watching this since this was such a good series that changed YouTube.
“Oh yeah, GULP GULP GULP”
I used to watch this series as part of my morning routine and I love rewatching it
I am so impressed with how decent the people are.  In my area of Florida the police would have been called thirty time in thirty minutes
Where does the money go when he does a great reset?
1:34 bro is leaving his camera what if someone takes it?
When you bump into sm1 else doing the challenge from the other side
Ryan Trahan never fails to entertain us
Rewatching this after a year😫
ohio
This was exactly 1 year ago
1 Year

One whole year… wow

He should've kept the sign from episode 1

Thank you god for everything
Oh yea baybee!
You are were I am

106
"ryan im bryan ryan"
water always wins soda
my first time watching...inspired bro nice work
Ryan’s the type of person to sell water for 2.00$, get only 1.00$ and not complain about it
Chipotle was only $7 a year ago??😵‍💫
Ryan has made my new favourite word,howdy 5:44 lol 8:50
ryan is so kind
I broke my leg the day this happened 😄😅🥲
Facial hair man
“Today did not go according to plan, *it went according to life*.”

Ah nvm, you did not in fact, throw out that chain.. lol relief😪
buritooo 9:28
gah 9:20
I can't believe he didn't slap his burrito🌯👋
So where’s the part where you summon your oppressor mk.II and fly around blowing stuff up
ryan isnt socially awkward hes awkwardly social
Watching these while I work on summatives leading up to exams. I really like this stuff.
Couldn't he just, you know buy a plane across the country
You should have gone to canes.
Everyone: No! You can't rate something above 10/10!  Ryan: YES
7:58
Word of the day : “howdy…”
7:59 Yes
Who knew that MrWhoseTheBoss would be onscreen
Where are his bike?
Bro made around 150$ selling water
Lately I’ve been seeing people with a missing leg way more now it’s getting creepy
Bro has infinity battery
Almost a year ago this came out, that makes me want to cry, i miss this series so much.
this was a great great great igreat series. I wish you do it again. But to your mother.
Hey you can't say I don't learn anything from watching this because now I know to never sell soda in LA
Almost 1 year so cool
Bro how has no one said: “OMG R U RYAN TRAHAN?”
Watching this in 2023… and the inflation on stuff. Wow. A case a water is like $10 now and I spend $20 at chipotle on a chicken burrito and chips
Ryan should do this again!
9:29 im like f**k you lemme have a bite
6:18
10:28 looks like that one spot from gta5
PM
I watched this when the king was coronated
Words can’t describe how I felt when this series was a thing
On my round two of watching this series:)
This is my third time watching this series! I love it soooo much!!
he made more money with water then soda
His butt is dirty
tommorow this will be 11 months ago
When i was breathing three times i yawn 😅
How can you return a used cooler? Sorry you got scammed :(
9:20 gauh
I actually tried joining Ryan with taking 3 deeper breaths and thanking God idea - I felt that I had nothing to lose so to speak! Raza :)
h2o fro the win
"gulp gulp gulp" 🤣 I love this guy!
what happend to the bike
I’m waiting for the sunscreen fr
Ryan: DIENG inside
POV: when u need the cooler back
5:00 sec on the eating a barito
I’m currently using this series to countdown the last 30 days of school
that was 4 seconds...
BRRRR SKIBY DOB DOB DOB YES YES
Bro is so entertaining and funny 😀😂
The amount of people watching counting how long it takes for Ryan to eat his burrito is hilarious.
I counted seven seconds
this man gives me hope in humanity
Who's watching again almost a year later
Well done on the profit
4:56 why are they wearing hoods in the beach in summer
I just know the editor is watching back the tapes and is physically cringing at every single awkward thing Ryan does.
Lol
Petition for Ryan to buy sunscreen
Second time watching this series and WHERE ARE THE ICED COFFEE'S
he's probably inspired so many people without a lot of money to earn a lot of money!
WHATS THE MUSIC AT 0:23
Thos series hasn't even been out for a year and it's already so nostalgic.
10:24 and someone else is not here now
5:34 bro just sold to the cartel
What if someone donated 50k 5 seconds before he hopped on the bus xD
10:33 THATS THE PLACE I HAVE BEEN TO
10:15
2:22
ISTG every video of this guy a verified YouTuber comments...this guy isn't only famous from citizens in the world but also famous in the famous people.
Did he turn a penny to a hundred
Shoutout to tony lol
I have a long way to go and NGL I LOVE the series
I am on this episode rn
What if ryan stayed in LA until he had enough money for a ticket to North Carolina then find his own way to mrbeast
Any one notice the theme song sounds like shuga vox from MSM?
You becoming a Christian is the best thing so am I and I could not love without the assurance of where  I am going in the end.. I am so glad you made the change a while back... And people who are doubting or having sorrows John 3:16.. Just believe in Him and only Him.. ❤
7 years until i can do this
i remember watching these and it does not feel like 10 months ago
Oh god these series make me Thirsty
i cried this guy is so nice
rewatching this in 2023 u should do this this summer
I was here
4
10:44 I happily did❤
i absolutely love your videos. you give so charismatic vibes and this is my second time watching this series. Keep up the good work❤❤😊 i would’ve been too awkward😂
i best thing i love that every morning i wake up i see a new part of these series and getting excited for tommorow
*the great reset*😂
That man made $100 of water
I’m just rewatching my fav episodes
Who’s watching this a year after it came out😂😂🎉🎉
The sand pouring out of his shoes was just.....wow.
The fact I k is every were he’s going is sad (GTA PLAYER)
HOLY CRAP 1.4M RAISED GREAT JOB RYAN
I kind of suspect a lot of people are more generous than they would if the camera wasn't there... But aside from that, this series is epic
At the end of the video you said the great resex
I love the sheer idea of doing this. It’s not like other content creators who go really extreme and do 50 hour challenges. But this is just pure, surreal, joy. This is what good content looks like.          Edit, Dang boi 211 likes…
Ryan surviving on one penny 0:47 💪🏻💪🏻
Bro anyone realize without tommy they would be in so much trouble
Can we agree that we’ve had that day when your at the beach and parents get so because your complaining about being hot and thirsty and decide to go on a hunt to stop the whining.
…………………………………………………………………………………………………….
7:59 YES
who else joined ryan in thanking god for three seconds?
HE MADE SOME MUCH FROM SELLING WATER HMMM I FOUND A SUMMER JOB
10:50
Returning a cooler you beat the crap out of a drug around all day is foul. Yea they are a big corporation and who cars, but your literally buying something, using it, and returning it. That is like renting it for free. Very uncool man.
it took you 6 seconds to eat that burrito
I think the music is what makes me sad
Have agreat day
Ryan you are the best the fact that you never give up also the fact that I gave up that my dad would come back with the milk  yet he never came back  and how you were ok when you were a kid  when you got hit by the belt any  way  keep doing what your doing
He said gulp gulp gulp 😳
The brteo on the video you finished it in5
7:06 🤨
A true genius
Ryan and gloom are my comfort YouTubers so during glooms break  he’s helped me through it because he’s so wholesome and fun. Also I’m still waiting for Daniel to adopt him. Also koo-laid gum is good. Thanks Ryan!
yikes
bro how do u do this, it took me a day to get a pen for penny...
Ryan is so sweet it’s crazy lmao 😊
Ryan: *taking deep breaths* 2.1 seconds later      B I K E
Can you do a penny challenge in Idaho
Gyjgfebn hi me
" ima eat this burrito in 2.1 seconds" me counting to 4 second
Bob is so cool do you agree with me ryan
Lets call em lost angels 😇 😇
Kool-Aid gum 👍
If anyone is wondering the whole seires is 7.5 hours long if anyone was wondering
7:36 A legend once said "Ryan Im Bryan Ryan"
Souppppppppp... but what kind
Bro there doing the griddy 😂
The guy sooo scammed you he looked sketchy
Public Bathrooms really
Before he went on the bus he should have sold the bike.
If ryan is ever homless he will find a penny on the ground and turn it into a villa
If you do I will subribe
Can you please do a shot out
a medium sized dry erase board would have been clutch!
He didn’t slap his burrito 😢
It's been 8 months-
Terrance kinda thick
I have an uncle named Tony.  Maybe he's the Tony who told you about 3 deep breaths and thanking God.
imagine saying "your price is way too high" in the beach
Bro is speed running life 😂😂😂
He’s amazing
its not right that you used the cooler and then returned it.
Ryan selling water “golp golp golp”
0:10
If he was ugly i dont think he'd have as much luck
Sorry no facial hair sorry Ryan 😂😶‍🌫️
Best series on YouTube!
7:06 be like gawk gawk gawk
what happend to the bike
hes so cringe but so funny and nice. love from the holtz's
:)
I started saying howdy because of you
good thing about ryan is he is sooo natural and funny....

Let’s go, Tommy
Who else is re-watching it, even though they watched it happen while it was daily uploads?
I like how generous people our :)

:<)
That gum is the worst gum I have ever had
He's not socially awkward, he's awkwardly social. 😀
This completely restores my faith in humanity.  :)
That kid thought a bottle of water for 2 was a good deal😂
So you can keep buying and selling coolers? Isn’t that kinda scammy?
And he donated
Bro I watch mrwhostheboss
ryan bryan ryan

I'm too young to know what it's like to gain money to sustain myself... but these videos are giving me hope that once I reach that point.... I'm gonna live!
I ❤your video’s your my favorite YouTuber
Subscribed, my fiance and I are LOVING your videos Ryan, keep up the good work.
I miss when I was so excited to watch the next episode, now it’s just not as exciting rewatching it 😢
4:40 i just got whiplash 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I was just randomly wondering you should do a Q & A lie if you agree
i love the music how the music called and i love ur videos

That water thing made you so much money

Can you do a penny challenge in Minnesota? I think it would be so funny because they love soda and usually will always buy soda from you! I just wanted to suggest it haha!
“The price is way to high you need to-“ “Cut it. I know😐😅”

He’s not socially awkward, just awkwardly social
He had one job… One Word… burrito tim-  8:54
Did you know that the danish kingdom has a land border with Canada  Im going to comment a fun fact about Denmark on every one of these vidios
Even with knowing what the great reset is it was still embarrassing 😂
333333333333$
Why don’t you buy a plane ticket or ride the bike and take breaks
Are my eyes Deceiving me because i think the dog on the beach you petted was lazarbeams dog or like the same breed lol?
You ate the burrito in 00:04.78 seconds
imagine selling water and it gives you more money then doordash
What happend to the bike?🤣🤣🤣one moment it was there and the next it was gone😂😂
Hou have sooo much keep on going
“Life is amazing I’m just gonna eat this burrito-Ryan trahan
how many coolers did ryan buy in this seriess?! xD
2:38 bro i have 2 pieces of gum in my mouth rn lol
At 4:59 I was reminded of the many life’s I have taken on the shores of Los Santos in GTA 5
That was 6 seconds
This could be a Netflix show
You did this in MAYYY
People in la are so nice !!! 🔥
Looking on the bright side, if the bus hadn't left before, you wouldn't have met Dennis
thins guy is a total mix of niceness, and cringe but SO entertaining to watch    AMAZING
he should of put $1.99 intead of $2 tbh, Americans are just built different when somethings 1 cent off 💀
YOU ARE THE BEST
His not afraid to put himself out there in the public
Wut in the burrito tho
bros in gta selling waters
Los Angeles more like los angels
Am I really the only one who thinks it's kinda outrageous that he returned two coolers to the store?!  He should have sold them. Or kept it since he needed it again anyway.
He is a good person he got a water cup and got water😂
HI
I love how wholesome Ryan and the people are! I’m so intrigued!
10:17 Ryan's gravestone:
Ilegal
This series got so popular its crazy, good work
Yo ryan has the fastest eater
you remind me so much of my brother 😂 you seem like a genuinely good person and I really appreciate that ❤
How dis man resist NOT DYING FOR A POOP 💩
he's lucky he doesn't have facial hair, at that point I'd already look like a hermit
I'm sorry but... GULP GULP GULP!?!?!?
WAIT. What burrito did you get for $6.84 at chipotle?! Ours is like $10
when you don't donate any money
so many npcs in the comments
Bro is selling water at the beach 🔥
You ate burrito 3 secs that was close gusse
Wow Ryan raised 1,412,182,00
Ryan Trahan is so smart
Bro your just like my friend Ryan he says hi and happy (what ever holiday it is) to random people which is funny, but he's one of my close freinds
This editor or who ever does it needs to do SO MUCH MATH    Edit: for the money counting 😂
imwatching this on memorial day the year after you posted this ( 11/11/22 )
8:57 he looks so happy when he says burrito time
I love watching these. It feels like we are going on the adventure with him. In the safety of our rooms!
Same lol
it’s 3am and i’m watching ryan trahan walk around venice beach and sell water bottles.
How does his phone charge?
can you reply hehe eh
BIG FAN WOOOOOO
6.84 for Chipotle??? I pay l;ike 10 bucks, wtf!!!
You Look like tom holland a little bit when your hair is wet 😂😂😂
This man just proved it possible to make money from possibly nothing
When you ever feel embarrassed, just think the people that are staring at you don't even know you, and you properly won't ever see them again(*^▽^*)    ( •̀ ω •́ )✧
Not just he’s super funny but interesting and kind but is also fundraising in the process luv you❤
I want to know the guy in the background with a pink shirt story 9:31
YOU ACTUALLY ATE THE BURRITO IN 5 seconds
amazing series
I’m surprised he isn’t using his task more as a sales pitch.. It might feel like cheating but he could just let people know why he’s doing what he’s doing and where their money is going.
I’m pretty sure that doordash money is because it’s illegal to employ someone under minimum wage, and you technically made less than minimum wage so they had to pay you the difference.
I’m gonna eat this burrito in 2.1 seconds…………Time.    It was 5 seconds
The thing you are doing is so good we should all appreciate his efforts towards his passion and going crazy limits to give us such good content
Am I the only won who can't stop watching this series
YOO ITS THE PLACE IN GTA!11!!11!!!111
ahhhhhhhh this seares is taking so long and i am only on vedeo 3
ryan u should buy the sunscreen...
I love how he says borito forgot how to spell it lol lol 😂 😂😂😂
When he said gulp gulp gulp 😳
i love this series
Ryan left his bike at the store 💀💀🎃
thank you for not only being wholesome but also being hilarious
Best YouTube
Love it!!!!!
You don’t say Los An-je-lenes. It’s Los An-je-les.
You’re not socially awkward, you are just awkward. But not socially.
Sorry what was the big reset again?
That money clinking sound effect is so satisfying
why im pink
Looks Like you have just spent a great day.
lessss gooooo
The great reset🔥
“40 waters going into cooler simple math 👁👄👁”
Selling water is the strategy of the thing 😂
Me watching this vid again and finding it weird that he didn’t slap the burrito😂
You want more attention? Get a crazy rash and sunburn yourself black
It has been 4 months...wow watched this series from the start i am missing it
anyone remember tommy?
Has anyone seen mr meow? I just can’t find my cat
Ryan after his 108.40 ! i dont know what to do!  me in my house !buy yourself some sunscreen
Ops first time I miss and hit dislike
u got like 2.7 dollars per water bottle if u divide it
LetS go tommy
😂
Cool . Jsyk iv survived 30 yrs on a penny. Its called working
Bro you can use salt to make ice more chilled and it will not melt soon
2:08 he had 69 cents
i dont agree with returning the water coler you getting it for free
Anyone know the name of the shoes he's wearing?
Tommy
Thank you, your brief gratitude reminder helped me in ways that are - eh - hard to explain.
Free trade rocks!
You can return a used cooler and get a full refund?
la Croix ryan,  la Croix
I'm late to be honest if you put the water 1.25 you would get 50 dollars
1:00 I'm not seeing any soap, gross
bruh this dude does not realize the insane luck he has i mean like he s lucky to have a good face he has such a perfect skin i d give everything even a leg, a lung, to have this perfect skin.. instead i have visible things on and i m depressed a lot so much i dont even go to school anymore  fml i hate it
Way more people would pay him for stuff if he were a kid :l😂😂
Amazing!
you ate the burrito in 3 secs not 2.1
100’000
I love how he stil tips and gives away money, even though he barely has any!! The sweetness in his heart is immeasurable!! :)
It feels so much like a video game and when he goes to the next town its like the next level
I’m binge watching this whole series lol
Good one tony
Ryan tryhard
You are now a businessman
Bro in gta5
bruh the lady who didn't even talk to him and just held up her hand for "5"
What I love abt Ryan is that he is so polite when ppl decline his offer
He knew the gulp gulp meme before us aLl
4:55 That guy was wearing pant and a hoodie at the beach
💖 Let's go nice people 💖
Doordash is a waste of time on bike when selling water makes more money
Over in Canada two dollars a water is literally the normal price😭😭😭😭😭 sending love from Canada 🇨🇦
9:02 - "I have one!" **grabs a microscope and zooms in to the computer screen** "Wait... all I can see are computer components... meaning RYAN TRAHAN IS A ROBOT!?!?!?"
Tip: Go to LA with a single penny and get enough money over the course of a few days to buy that one expensive video game you've been wanting.
dude i just started watching your videos and I already like them so much
xd is so 2015
Let’s go tommy
Bro the way you went from a Penny and gained a bike and that money in three days is insane
at 13:06 his eyes are red😳
10:36 I'm an atheist
Your a good youtuber I wish I could be a youtuber beacause being a youtuber can inspire people
Bro be in gta
Honestly, returning the cooler after dragging it around the beach... ? And then either the store has to ditch it or someone buys a used cooler? That's very strange to me.
LETS GO TOMMY                    In the comments I want to see it
Nobody: Fun Fact: He made well over 100$ in 3 days and in my country $100=70,000 my local currency and that way more than an average educated worker monthly salary.
Omg he didn't talked about Mrbeast for so long that i forgot he was doing for Mrbeast.😂
Can you please do a penny to 1000 dollars
I love how everytime ryan is awkward he apologises😭💗
Why the beach was like GTA V
Man.. I wish I have the personality that you have. I would travel the world like this!
Bro I've been there in gta
Me in the beginning  "ryan your bike"🤦🏾‍♀️
I keep waiting for the cops to stop you and ask if you have a permit.
Bruh i only know your locatinon cuz i play a lot of gta 😅
I’ve been watching since your first vide
Ryan keep on doing the good work🎉
Ryan: “I’m gonna eat this burrito in 2.1 Seconds” Me who used my phone and timed it: “ 🤓 Actually it was 3.9 Seconds 🤓 ”
Ryan makes more off of eater than door dash great side hustle
Life's Amazing I going to eat this burrito  -Ryan Trahan 2022
1:00 who else knows that shower from the prank of put soap on people as they are showing
6:46
Why can't he take the bike with him to the next city?
bro i think everyone loves ryan bc he's so awkward🤣❤
its was actually 4 seconds lol
Why is it so expensive
how
how did he raise 1,000,000 dollars
14:54
0:00
I like how the GPS  cuts of what he wants to say 😃 😀 😄
Just for this series I went and got a ice coffee
I like how his bike disappeared throughout half of the video
omg so
Literal definition of "money cant buy happiness".... well not the definition its really jusr kinda related but it still applies so
What do you do when you need to go to the restroom
yea emo isnt really "joyfull"
BRO GOT 5K FOR JUST SELLING WATER?
Man props to the camera to have to film him doing all of this

Hi, I just wanted to say that you’re a determination simbol, in my country, there is a lot of people in the streets, that ask money for just drugs and alcohol, and you, in 3 days has lots of things!
you eated that burrito in 4 seconds
i would give money but i dont have some sorry
G                                                               G
I love Ryan's positivity, we need more youtubers like this
At first, I felt second hand embarrassment for this dude, but now it's just funny😅😅
Free money glitch
Kool aid gum 11/10
I would donate but im in Brazil
ryan is so innocent also ryan: gulp gulp gulp gulp
Good job ryan keep up the amazing work!❤️ (also ignore my profile it’s my brother’s😂!
6:17 realised that the dog and sidecar were from the give me a kiss music video by crash adams, which was shot around the same location
The *OH MY GOODNESS* makes me laugh for no apparent reason.😭🤚
I love the backround music
That is 2 words not 1 word
he is so thankful its so cool to watch
What happeneds if he gets mugged
Next challenge trying to not eat McDonald’s and chipoliete for 1 minute
1:05 this place, I recognize it. Is that the exact showers where these guys did a prank on people, and this strong dude starts raging because for some reason, his shampoo is still sudding.
SB737
Yes
10:07 him: Ima go eat this burrito in 2.1 seconds The recording: 5 seconds
the ending theme a bop tho
Me
You have gained SO much subs from this series ❤ I’m pretty sure I was here since 2 mil! 😳😳
best series
Ryan is just a legend, a gigachad and a man with a beautiful smile
the time lapse song will always be the best song ever.
one person-: oh no, he's gonna see how much i donated! another guy-:oh no. he's gonna see how much i support the videos he makes! that one person that listens on Spotify-: uhhhhh..
😁
Why keep returning that cooler!!!!!!
but seriously.. appreciate ya man
why dont i do this, to make a profit of a 100 bucks everyday.. and then upload it to youtube.. when i can get a yt and 100 bucks.. STONKS
Can save money by buying from the supermarket 🤣
Also needs to pay for internet.
Selling water pays more than door dashing
Alguien que hable español?
You changed my life
Pretty cringe
New sub btw <3
Your videos are awesome, but it hurts me every time you reuse the same song for the same montage every time. No offense obviously. Still amazing series!
him: BE free to Join me in my 3 deep breaths and saying thanks to god  me: * 3 heavy breaths * thanks good my father doesnt know i am still Up at 1 am watching your series while eating crisps and realizing i have school in 6 hours
I just love when he says…THE GREAT RESET! :in sain music playing:
10:44 I'm an atheist, but thank you for the offer
my mans just made a hundo off of selling bottled water lol nice
Who saw his red eye in 13:06
The price of food in America is so cheap what the hell
Never cringe ryan
i miss this series 😭😭😭😭
I'm so EMO right now-Ryan 2022 🤣🤣🤣
Does anybody know what happend to THE BIKE?????????
I love the part when he eat it in 2.1 seconds
Tony: take 3 deep breath and thank god every day Me/Andrew Tate fan:Breathe air
Nice
pengaturan ulang yang hebat
Day 3 of commenting 🎉
Dude you’re the nicest person in the entire world
Love you Ryan
Ryan ur so funny always makes me laugh :D
Angel that's not what emo means 🤣
How was your chipotle 7 dollars what did you order
secound time watching this series
Our plan to sell water! Huh ?!?🤔 I expect my cut!
I watched the whole series and I’m watching it again I love this
You said byee like Liza Koshy used to lol
Its so funny with his awkward laugh its like not awkward just watched the whole series watching it again!
I’m  your Number one biggest fan
wow
I thought this would be too awkward but it is wildly entertaining.
My heart goes out for Brian
Turning $1 dollar bill into $1000 dollars
ILL EAT THIS BURRITO IN 2.1 SECONDS!!!!  "um actually it was 5 seconds🤓''
Your welcome
This does just prove that even if you feel you’re in a whole finance wise, you can start from nothing and get so much. I’d say as long as you have a penny, you could slowly trade like those stories you see - but with a phone, apps like door dash open a whole wide path to money earning. (And they even have apps that can tell you which food delivery app is giving the most money too)
“Oh yeah, GULP GULP GULP”
Day 3 of watching this series once again .
Ryan: imagine i fell off  Also ryan:*jumps*
man this series just gives me so much comfort that i had to watch it a second time this journey was absolutely incredible bro keep up the good work 👍
10:10 Time Was 4 Secs
when you buy water in a vending machine, it’s a buck? buck-fifty? $2.00 would be overpriced at the store sure but for ice cold bottled water on a hot day out about where there isn’t just potable water at your finger tips, it’s pretty reasonable.
7:12 THAT GUY IS MAtt MORDOCK     I think, cuz IDK just search him up, he plays deadpool in MCU!!          BTW just an assumption lol
You might be the only person to have awkwardness and not be cringe at all
At 5:00 there’s a tower thingy on the side. I was bike riding by there so uh.. yeah idk why I’m commenting this I’ve just been there before
im watching this at 6am while getting ready for school
honestly not the intended point of your video but t his is helping my social anxiety a bit, if you can go out and return a cooler multiple times and walk around all day than i can go out and just do normal things. weird
I really hope you buy sunscreen at some point because it’s stressing me out. Sunscreen is a necessity too!
ello😅😅
It’s wild how I heard of you today and you’ve inspired me so much
hghguh
This is my second time watching this video
Love this kid…. Just so pure
Here’s a tip if you want to sell soda specifically Coke go to the Midwest
Stat a series of being in an underwater hotel
If someone did a challenge like this but started at canada, it would be cheating (cuz canada is the polite country)
how did you get a burrito for 6 dollars?????
Imagine if you just sold water for 2 fillets every day. You could make 80-100 dollars a day witch means 560-700 dollars a week witch means 21000 dollars a month
Alternate title: tom homland sells water bottles to survive
ryan trahan has proved that starting from nothing from a PENNY can get you anywhere
I bet you could ask a restaurant for ice if you ever need ! Idk if it’s worth the trouble but desperate times call for desperate things
His poses are awesome every video like seriously 11:12
how have you been charging your phone these last 3 days whilst sleeping outside? or have your editors been charging it their van?
RYAN TRAHAN FOR PRESIDENT
Brave
5:04 THE LAUGH-
Uhhhh how about you go in the bike and just bike in there
he said hell eat the burrito in 2.1 seconds, he took 7
This man is really renting a cooler
I love how you been biking around my neighborhood for the past 3 days
I love rewatching these vids <3
2:43 thats what she said
bruh u returning a used cooler. u renting it for free? then some one buys it thinking its new but its has been draged on the beach and stuff. bruh
Finding your videos is the best thing that happened to me in a while 🫶🏻
I came from Haley Pham video, this is great thing you’re doing 🥹🫶🏽
I love the the theme music as u walk with ur cooler😂
I really enjoy watching your videos, you remind me of myself
Ppl are so nice an generous..I'm in the wrong state apparently 😔
Water 2.00 dollars
The beach looks the one is evanston
His business strategy is lowkey pretty sound lmao he’s got really low start up and high profit margins considering he’s only paying roughly .13 a water
I am so glad that I found your content.
Is this guy Ryannotbrain or just Ryan
wow
Wow. Advertising you are a thief.  You returned the cooler when you used it.  That makes you a thief no matter how you justify it.
at this poit we basicly forgot he was gonna give mrbeast a penny
Enjoyed this video!
He should’ve chained the bike to the cooler to pull it with
He's becoming richer than he already is LOL
I’m just saying, this is kind of proof that you can make money from nothing. I’m aware that he’s got a phone to go on Facebook and buy a bike, also a bank account to be able to take transfers and not just cash. But it is doable. And has so far gotten lucky with his sleeping arrangements. But it’s doable.
MrBeast
venice beach
what chipotle can you get a drink and burrito for under $15 lol
If I can make that much money from selling waters and sodas I’m doing it
His personalty is just brightening up my day
I should stop working and sell soda on the beach lmao!
Day 3 is the besttt
8:56  O N E W O R D
Great series, Ryan! Keep it up!
🥵🧟‍♂
Ryan i am Bryan Ryan
Can you actually do that returning the cooler back and forth I thought you can only do that 1 time?
I re watching the series
Bro the gulp gulp gulp 7:06
What the flip
The girl in the back bruh
Returning the cooler is abit low
i like this man
this is a brilliant idea for a video and executed so well. and for a great cause. hope your doing well Ryan
5:50 *”is that 50cent?!”*   Brain: “take you to da candy shop”
Always be grateful to breath couldn’t be more accurate.   My dog with lung cancer is currently laying in my lap struggling to breath. She only has a couple more days to live 😢.
wut hapend to his bike
WHY DO YOU ALWAYS APOLOGISE TO THE CAMERA? 😂😂😂😂
i just started watching this series Ryan , and its so beautiful and inspiring what you're doing ^^
How do you charge your phone?
9:01 meeeeeeeeeeeeee lol
Bro you are beyond my expectations. I can't even imagine of living like you. Dude love from India🇮🇳🇮🇳
In Germany the police would've arrested you for selling water without a license. Bureaucracy is mental here.
This year is going to be great
This is my 3rd time watching this series and every time I love it but if I was to say one thing bad thing Ryan you apologise too much
Breath in breath out, Breath in breath out, Breath in breath out thank you God for giving me everything I have   Amen
I dont understand, is the cooler rented or did he sell it back?
4 seconds for burrito not 2.1
ryan is now in day 3
Bruh when he done the pose for "THE GREAT RESET" a woman looked at him 😆 - behind rhe tree
Tommy was a god
Your videos are so entertaining
Freaking love your videos!!
Those kool aid gums are so bad imo
Joking
He already has 10m subscribers so he has 1m meals
When he saves up enough money he should just buy a plane ticket
im really hoping he invests in some sunscreen
Returning cooler is cop out
Why did Ryan rub his eyes like that after counting the money from selling water
If 2 billion people are on the internet almost 1 billion people are are youtube so how come t series has only 221 million subsiribers
He's so adorable! Don't feel afraid to show yourself, Sometimes people try to wreck you.
People saying $2 for water is expensive? Try $8 in Australian Airports 😂
6 bucks for a burrito at chipotle?  how is that possible?  their prices are way higher than that
I just know he smells so bad rn 💀
Amen! Keep thanking God for every day. Thankfulness is a very fulfilling lifestyle. God bless you! 🙏
is anyone rewatching this cuz it’s nostalgic…it’s been almost a month! thx ryan for a great time♥️
There are 3 types of people 1. The people who buy water  2. The people who didn’t buy water 3. The people who thought it was 200$
2 dollars for someone to bring you ice cold water or soda in Venice beach isn't a bad deal at all in my opinion. I don't know why some people are complaining about the high price when parking is 15 usd
this guy just loves chipotle i want sum 2
his awkwardness is my favorite part, one of the most authentic humans out there
Seeing all those people being so nice to Ryan restored my faith in humanity
Wow You are doing so good
10:52  boy biking
These idiots, IT’S 2 DOLARS
I rate your challenge a 9/11 on the interesting scale, good job
Did he have only one burrito for whole day?
Survived with 0.01 penny and and iphone13 ;)
Gud mornin
You should’ve sold the water that was in the cooler
You should’ve sold the water that was in the cooler
he finally gone crazy i guess
You changed YouTube your amazing Ryan!!
Bro is inflation
Feed 🇨🇦
Familai Zamboni esta acompanhado! Brazil
“i’m so emo right now”
So sad its over whos also re watching?😭
this feels like a netflix show
Just subscribed+1 penny
Life lesson: sell water
How come a chipotle burrito in LA cost half of what is costs in my little Midwest town?
I found a ferrari and a Porsche
I subbed now we’re saving 10 meals my boy let’s go let’s end world hunger ✌️✌️✌️✌️✌️ who else is with me 🤟
Dude is giving life hacks 🤣
How does he charge the camera?
Hes so positive
I love that he's still generous and invites people for burgers and such even if he's short on money...
i've only watched 3 episodes of this series rn, but i can clearly see that you deserve a new subscriber! hi!
at this point this is a tv show
you should sell the water for one dollar so more people would want to buy and you're still getting profit
6:30 so why did the amount reset even tho he lost 20 dollars? Does it not count like where did he get the money back  7:10 also here why did the amount only go up by $6 for a purchase of 5 of the waters
What’s 100k?
ryan should keep all the money for the one penny thing
Why does everyone ignore you
The fact that you’re buying people food & giving away change while trying to accomplish this challenge is so wholesome and generous!! 🥹
i love seeing my kind of awkwardness in other people. i have asd and been told i’m unapproachable and weird. but idk i think i’m cool
I was in LA a few months ago
The kolade gum has no flavor lol
You know what? I’ve been unsubscribed for too long. Goodbye to that 😊
2:00 man whats with the 2 $
Six seconds and something Point seconds
Jesus loves y'all and Is The Way To Everlasting life
Finishing this melody this feels like a necessity
Hello Ryan me and my cousin have been watching your videos and we got inspiration from your penny seris and we  are going to be doing this on vacation. Just like you all the money we make will be donated to charity. Thank you so much Ryan!
Wonder where he is charging his phone
These videos are addicting.
Ryan: Oh yeah gulp gulp gulp
Day 3 and he's still in LA
That’s 2 words
This guys awesome. Im hooked. I just can’t help thinking how different/dangerous it would be for a girl especially times without a cameraman
This is awesome  Only thing is, what atore takes back a cooler that was used and rolled on in the street all day? Surely those wheels didn't look pristine!
Does anyone know what the music is at 6:32
Been here since 300k
Man is making maddd profits selling a single water bottle for 2 dollars whereas he got 40 for 5
Ryan your on excatly 10.1m subs
wow, people are so generous in LA its so heartwarming
Dude he’s anikan he hates sand haha
Hey Ryan, just heard of you today. I'm currently catching up on the series. Your attitude towards the unknown is really admirable. Thank you for sharing this with us.
Just do it                   - gatorade drink
➖_
ticket for $30 crazy what bus is that?
In gta
10:32 I used to snipe people off there
Let’s go Tommy
Just casually binge watching this series
1:24 wait they drink water?
Man loves these uploads came here from tgf watching the 30 days
its always the brothers appreciating the efforts of a seller
Notice how ryan put cheese on his chipotle andhesaid he was lactose antoletant
He did this all during the inflation
I’m gay for u
I’m gay
Ryan you should of use fetch.
No way he just randomly came across the big green Marquis tent on Memorial Day
Ryan: “For $5,000 I will give you a verbal thank you at the end I f the video.” Feeding America:  “MrWhosetheboss donated $5,000!” Also Ryan:  “Maybe next vid.”
me as a kid couldnt even make 1 penny but look at him
Like aki magyar
Yes mrwhosetheboss
LA be poppin!
Most of the videos almost make me want to go out side…
There is too much sand that  goes  in his shoes
sure is getting a work out lol
This was a good video to enjoy today and made my day better then it was to be honest :)
Let's Go
This is so inspiring because just like you started from a penny, everyone else can. All you need is a penny to change anyone’s life :3
8:18 If You Know You Know
The craziest part is how he got a chipotle burrito and a drink for only 6 dollars 🌯??
Lesson learned:  You can make more money selling water than doing doordash lol
YOU MADE SO MUCH MONEY THAT IS CRAZY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
$6.84 for burrito at chipotle? Was this filmed in 2006? 😂😂
Put your bike on the bus with you
YESSSS CHIPOTLE
Did he just get 2 koolers we’re is the other one?
LETS GO TOMMY
How does his phone still work how is it not dead😂
1.000
9:02 🎶who has a microscope under the sea Ryan trahan🎶
11:12 God Ryan I love you 😂
Best Youtuber in the world RN
me who lives in LA and has a life supply of soda:
Great video! Keep trusting in Jesus Christ.
Lol, ima still go with let's go Tommy  cut why not. LETS GO TOMMY
I can just imagine doing this is Ireland u would either be soaked by rain or soaked by sweat
ryan: how many do you want? random lady: ✋🏻
I really just love these cool and nice strangers hahaha
"he forgot to give me it, it was a complete accident!" Started checking the background for a corpse lmao
Ryan is such a genuine and nice man also handsome
:)
LETS GOOOOO TOMMY
Koolaid gum, luxurious ✨ 👌
Anyone else coming back to watch?
You can't just borrow the coolers
what happend to the bike???
wait if it's called the great reset but it's bad wouldn't you call it the bad reset
Bro got scammed for the water 💀
Ain no way tha waters was that heavy😭😭😭
4:59 is in gta

How does he shower?
You are emo👀
Let’s go Tommy day 3
H20mg
U can return the coller bruh in alley .in india u cant retutn even in 10 minutes
You forgot to slap the burrito
Congo for 10 million.   Right now it's 9.99 mil..
O7
Ryan, if you see this, know that i did not catch the series as it happened, but im binging it now, give me a few days and youll see me at the finale
Easiest way was to sell his iPhone 13 Pro Max and then he can ride a plane across the country...
I love this
If should sell 5.00 dollars for each water you get 200
can we appreciate how hard Ryan works on his videos to entertain us
Just sell the I phone dude.......not bottles all problems are sot out
GREAT JOB RYAN
How is rite aid accepting the cooler return so easily after he dragged it through the sand?
🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿Los angelans🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿
the guy at 7:20 matches the cooler
Everything he said he would eat in like two seconds it’s like five seconds
Faith in humanity? Restored
I love his good mornings 🥲so pure
YO THIS GUY HAS ALMOST GOTTEN 10M!!! EVERYONE PLEASE GET THIS GUY TO 10M HE IS A LEGEND
2:11 Isn't that the sign of Freemasonry?
bro why did you say "happy" memorial day
Can we just rename the series 'Capitalism'
I am following this series now going very good 😊
Minecraft hardcore
how was he charging his phone? 🤨🤨🤨
10:35 this ☺️
I have actually had the koolaid gum before it came out and I would disagree because it losses its flavor and then just tastes like plastic
8:56 "burrito time" are two word
A man never give up anything
If people don’t drink soda. Then why were they in the store?
Day 3 of asking Ryan to try mocha caramel latte oreos
W-what is this thumbnail????
I love your videos
How stupid i Find that you can return a used cooler for 100% cashback after you use it and pull through the sand all day. That shit will go to somebody else, in europe you used it, you keep it
I wonder what we should call the fanbase (the viewers) maybe the Trahan Team
my guy almost at 10mill subs
Why do I kind of want that bike
Just the thumbnail
Reminds me of gta
get this thing to 300,000 likes already
How did this mans get a Burrito from Chipotle for $6!!
MY HOUSE IS IN THIS VID WTF
oh man how is he have so much energy to do all this by only eating one burger
I freaking hate how he doesn’t just charge 1 dollar for a water 2 is so damn overpriced
for a few seconds I thought 1000$ wasn’t much money
Opiate eyes
7:06 oh yeah gulp gulp gulp
Bro’s in gta
"Idk what to do"  Buy more water 💧
The day he filmed this my great uncle passed:(
what a journey
I had to wait until the whole series was out to watch bc I didn’t want to get too excited to wait lol
Mr beat and keem sent me
You got this Ryan
8:54 Chipotle is my favorite restaurant
7:55 me after getting ditched by friends
"my last kennedy'' "is that 50 cents?" oof
Man: says 2$ is too high Also Man: pays 5$
You can’t just start with a new iPhone lol you should’ve got a government phone
I would like to have doordash app in my country, sounds fun and easy ngl
Respect to the ppl wearing hoodies ;-;
Why does this makes me so happy
❤️💯👑
Who's now binge watching the whole series over again?
OMG MRWHOSETHEBOSS DONATED THATS AMAZING
.
"Who has a microscope" 😂😂
So many nice people! Selling water for $2.00, those people said "No, that's too much. Have $5." Three deep breaths a day and a thanksgiving to God is a great idea. I don't think about that as much as I should.
Me thinking of when he's gonna leave L.A.
How was the soda fail
6:55 is that Quinn?!?!?!
The last one who bought the water was a legend! Day 3 was the day that u made a lot of money so far. Let's go Ryan! - Day 3
Currently rewatching every episode in one night before Day 30 hits.
day 3 of asking u to say BOOM! when u 10m
him returning the cooler constantly is a violation 😭💀
Best strategy to make extra cash sadly I don’t live in a popular area
First 100$ For The Series 3
e
Whoever’s reading this, I pray that whatever your going through get better and whatever your struggling with or worrying about is going to be fine and that everyone has a fantastic day! Amen to you
Ryan please buy sun screen. I am worried for your skin.
Lololol this is awesome. Did you buy and return a cooler twice to the same store so far lol? Same employee?? That would be hilarious
Your so funny love your videos make more pls am seeing all the days there just not boring i like seeing these videos make more bc a lot of us love you so much 🙏☺️👍🤪
Some insane Karen YOUR TEAHING KIDS THEY CAN RUN AWAY But seriously bro this cause is super holsome but a good idea is for every subscriber unsuscribed and then resubscibed
For some reason I really wanted him to run into Isiah photo while in LA cause he lives there
A really cool concept more people should try out for content, could be done in so many ways from that 1 penny 🙌🏻💯
7:00 that was very wholesome
Every Like Is A W For Tony!
Almost at day 30! The reason the water sold more was because Los Angeles and other beach city’s are trying to go healthy
Gta beach
Read my name
WAIT WAIT AIT 40 WATERS FOR 5$??????????? BRO WITH 5 OF MONEY IN MY COUNTRY U JUST BUY A PACKAGE OF CHIPS A SMALL PACKAGE... i will go to america one day trust me
1:09 they came out at the same time!
You are a such great YouTuber
3
MORNING I FORGOT TO COMMENT
Who else was here when he tried to beat doctor Phil in subs
Me an atheist at 10:39
Im from the future
ryan is the most ambitious, inspiring, kind, awkard and charismatic guy ever
30 Minecraft days probably
K but how long did that Koolaid gum flavor last?
My social anxiety could never
He got 13 pro? Danggg
Lucky u didn't meet any Karens when u were selling soda and water
Ooooooooooooooooooooooh
I can describe the whole series in 2 words : Survival game
You do want to be the great reset or No
"Bro u got to lower the price" Me:it 2$ for one water bottel bro...
Imagine if I got pinned (=<
Why can't you take the bike on the bus?
What I would've done is save up enough to get a plane ticket and just fly
400,000 subscribers in two days
$2 for that water is expensive soda even more so, but in the middle of nowhere like that, it's called demand, I'd buy an ice cold soda for $2 in the middle of the beach!
Can I have a bite of your burrito??? :-\ :-\
That was 4 secs
When u said just got whiplash for some reason I died laughing idk why tbh
that is kinda crazy how you made $100+ in just 3 days from literally nothing (you could find a penny on the floor) plus a marker, a blanket and a bike. I guess you also need a phone for doordashing, but most people have a phone. The location probably helped a lot, they were pretty generous, but still a lot of kids watching should take note to earn some extra pocket money
How do you charge your phone?
Howdy Ryan!
5:25 that sweaty demon slayer fan :)
the thumbnail is a masterpiece
47
👍
I just donated a penny (:
Everyone who bought a water is legendary. Tony is also legendary.
4 sec
Buy bear
I am confused how he got 108 and went to rite aid and got $135
Yeah I was gonna say something like that XD
What happened to the bike while he was selling the water???????
A humble young man that believes and thanks God? Worth watching.
Best part is that's he's so humble when people say keep the change
He should just do this for like 20 days straight than buy a train ticket or sth like thatdirectly to NYC haha
LETS GO TOMMY
and share
in every video I saw l am gonna like and subscribe
It is so amazing how Ryan takes his own  time to do amazing stuff for people
When he was selling 40 waters  He said: ENJOY Buyer: YOU TOO🤦‍♂️
Nice
That facial hair smaller than mine I'm f****** 13
Lol
he so akward
ITS THE PICTURE ON THE FROBT FOR ME😭😭
Ryan YOU'RE INSANE BRO I could never do this Like
It's good that he's selling water on the beach but like let's hope people pollute the beach..
I love his personality
Dude good idea where ever u are right now u don’t have to spend money on food go to five guys buy everything in the side and ask for a extra bun and boom free burger for a couple of cents
I’m sorry did he say “happy Memorial Day” not a hater just confused me cause it’s not a happy day
You must loose so much weight of doing this
Can someone tell me what mic he uses? I want to get one for my videos! His audio sounds so crispy!
3:50 to 3:52 Anakin Skywlker:
I also don't understand why he didn't get sunscreen
Wow i just love this practice ..many people are afraid of shaming....it helps to build the confidence..😍😍😍😍😍 Love From Nepal _ I can I will
3:44 "imagine I fell off" 😅😅😆 Ryan is an ABSOLITE savage for that one.  Ahahahaha
Did he buy the phone with the money🤨
Ryan is so inspiring
I all ways get rashs
Bruh im selling water
Hej
Somehow this guy turned 5 USD worth of water into 90 usd
Love your content Ryan keep up the good work and your my number 1 favorite youtuber
Love your content keep up the good work and your my number 1 favorite YouTuber
I love your awkwardness you are brilliant hehe You should have rigged up the cooler behind the bike and been on door dash while you were selling water and made money both ways ;)
Who thinks Ryan is a good YouTuber?
Let's go tony
Subscribe and unsub I found a  infinite money glitch
Me having a stuffy nose and  not being able to breathe with him 🫠
He has the personality of a golden retriever (that’s not a bad thing)

Nice vid
.
Ryan trahan is wasting 30 days
Ryan trahan

My personality is this guy 7:35
7:35 I love this guy
7:35 POV your personality is this guy
7:37 I like how this one guy was saying that the prices were too expensive and then gives him $5 and keep the change 🤗
I just realised how expensive bottled water is in sweden compared to america
😎
Ever since I started watching your videos i loved them🥳 the best thing about your Videos is EVeRYTHING
Its so cool that in your country if you say "have a good day" they say "thank you" in my country if you say "have a good day" they say "f#$k you"
I love how he returns the cooler and then gets the same cooler
Hes confident, but awkward
🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙃🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂
day 3  money reset 0 dolers fun fact :today is the first shower of the series
This is why I like going to America as a Filipino because if I have 1 dollar its like 50+ pesos in the Philippines
come to germany, its easier, we have 9 Euro Ticket
Why do u always say u don’t know if u have change when you literally have 5 dollars in 1 dollar bills
Ryan! This series is amazing, I started watching today but I’m gonna try to catch up immediately it’s so addicting!
if your passing through middle tennessee you got a free bed at my place
I just realized, how does his phone not die...???!!!
Hey dude you just got a new subscriber May god bless your heart, and May he have a plan for you. 😊
Dude you are insane not only is this really entertaining you also have helped so many people
10:36  Take 3 breath and thank god everyday?    I have a better one,  why not Pray 5 times a day and thank the Almighty Creator for every little thing you have. Praying at morning 5 am Noon 1pm Afternoon 5pm Evening 7pm And at night 9pm  And you watch how that 5 times prayer connect you with the Almighty CREATOR and how those prayers humbles you :) And pray bowing your head to the the Ground (calls Sujood)  Take this from another stranger.  @Ryan
I love how he’s not disrespecting people when they don’t want to buy from him! Thanks for being this way man! Love from Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
taste like the koolaid man
5:25 that kid has a nice kny shirt
2:43  umm Ryan I think you were supposed to pour the ice first?
ryan just sold water thats worth like 10c for $2....       this man is a legend
How's he charging his phone everyday?🤔🤔
Just donated 0.01 let's go
Mans is making me quenchaful rn 😩
not lying man, sure of that you're a good man. this video is so educational.
6.84 for Chipotle? What a deal
Just realized this is the place gta 5 is based off 😭
10:49 when you’re playing a horror game and the monster/creature walks right past you
I was highly depressed and this video helped me forget life, thank you.
10:39 I'm not a huge believer to God but this also made me feel so good. I thank to God, or world, or universe, to something bigger than me.
Hi Ryan Trahan i love your vidos i am sub to you  i  you should to get i can commet on his vid and ask him
What happened to the bike
What happened to the bike after buying waters?
sell the bike
Hey he need a FREAKIN BRUSH
i dont think the guy forgot the 20$ he scammed you
Try this challenge again from Prince William County in VA and head to go see yourself in LA!
i love this guy
I'm about to go live out my car and camp for the next 2 months to make money working this series is helping Me alot fr
My name isemilio
2:41 those gums are nasty I got them a few months ago there not that good 😭
ryan is so awkward and i love it 💀
Bruh i love his awkwardness its hella funny 😂
I remeber being willing to pay anything for a water after work on a summer day. Ppl underestimate how valuable water is.
E :)
How did he charge his stuff
Is that the place where HooMan did the shampoo prank? 1:04
Yeah, he didn’t want to grow facial hair... then it grew on him 😂 Remember that joke from a previous penny challenge?
I've been watching for 4 years good stuff
I just subbed, gl my man
Crazy
Ryan is so good to watch on an all nighter
This feels like an actual show
2:05 he has 69 cents 😳
Imagine if one donates 50000on the 29th day then that will Ryan do?
i wish i could donate but im from australia
This would be less entertaining but it maybe would be easier to just grind for money and get a plane ticket
This series is getting interesting day by day
6:55 is that quinn ?🤔
I love this guy sm
I can't donate but hope a sub works?
Ryan is emo???
10:28 I LITERALLY SAID THE SAME THING
Selling water at the beach is apparently a good side hustle
Why u not slap
Honestly, this is why I don't give perfectly able bodied ppl money for just begging. You can take $5 and be an entrepreneur in this great country. No reason to not hustle! Let's gooooooo!
You should get the carnitas instead of the chicken
Great job
Walmart great value water 48 bottles cost around 4.00 Then sell for 1 dollar each make 48 dollars
I just realized he’s in GTA
So good💙
what shoes are you wearing bro
When I realize I'm watching a whole series:0
Does the meals are really for America (continent) or only United States?
I’m gonna donate 50,000 right now-
Isaiah Photo donated 5 grand  TOO EASY!!!
I wanna do door dash now but like I can't drive yet😐
2:58 You're gonna sell Water magnesium
200,000
Watching this guy because I had a bad day! Lost my 3 year bestfriend and shit, she wasn't mad or anything, she just left me lol. Watching this also because this series is the only thing that I can watch when I'm sad and bored. Thanks Ryan! (a little late!)
.
Other Dutch people watching this:  *But water comes from the tap? no*  PS. Americans are nice. The image here in EU about the US is so wrong..
0:12  Literally Luffy called Hancock
Love you Ryan Keep making the videos❤️
bro at 5:34 done had a knife in his pocket
despite the fact he started from a penny and had not much money to live off he still gave people stuff cheaper or even free
congrats ryan fav youtuber keep doing great!!!
The only thing I could think this entire video is “I’ve definitely been here in gta before”
I actually love this video but America isn't your country America it's a continent the country that you're living at its name USA
Can someone doordash me kfc
Revolutionary
Ryan is so cute😭💗💗
Crazy how he made more money selling water at the beach than doing doordash
0:01 stranger things 4 reference!!!
u should have paid ur camera man tto sell water while u doordash
Do you guys want some water*? Awesome* lol
YOU DIDNT SMACK THE BURITO
he is so awkward its so adorable
''THE GREAT RESET''
Really enjoying the series so far! Keep up the great work Ryan! (my name is Ryan too)
5:44
This guy makes me happy
Spread the gospel
Day 3 of binge watching this series haha yeah kinda late but I'm gonna try my best to get there soon too in a couple hours probably lmao
e
"this is a penny" "good morning :)" "good morning sleepy heads :)"
10:35 I was having an anxiety attack one day and my mom came into my room and said “Just breathe but just coz you are breathing doesn’t mean you are alive” and I was like mom why would you say that?!?
Rite Aid customer who bought a used sandy cooler  😢
What happened to the bike
Hey Ryan, remember "LET'S GO TOMMY"
Lol what we’re have learned: Selling sodas,candy,or water gets you  20 bucks from a random kid or man
i'm wondering how is it possible to keep returning the cooler, why would the store accept it if not in pristine condition?
That’s two words
waht if i spam subscribe and unsubscribe   am i the next hero of the world?
Cashier: “Sir, why is this cooler full of sand” Ryan: “It came like that?” *awkward laugh*
This tells us a lot about the economy
10:35 what is the soundtrack called?
10:49 thats cap
Is nobody going to talk about whenever he was selling water he just left his bike at the store 🤔
I could really go for an ice cold bottle of water But i live in lithuania 💀
I love this guy so much
Got like peter parker awkwardness vibes
Could some enlighten because I'm not from America. But I imagined that memorial day would kinda be like ANZAC day here in Australia. It wouldn't be a happy occasion. So why is he saying happy memorial day? Or is that not how it works in America. Again sorry if it sounds rude but yeah it's genuine
7:55
The number of people who said, "you need to cut your price" or '$2 is too expensive' shocks me. Where I'm from $2 USD for water is cheap!
0:21 the sussy moment hits
OMG RYAN TRAHAN YOU ALREADY RAISED MORE THAN 100,000!
Mjhmjmjmj,
I use to live LA into 2020 lol and I drank  soda
if it was really that hot i would have paid ryan 10 bucks to throw the water from the cooler on my head
I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU GOT IN YOU CHIPOTLE ORDER BC IT BEING CHEAPER IN CALI THAN WHERE I AM IS CRAZY NGLLLL
Burritooooooo
Epic video
Lets go Tommy!
Do you know Popin
Ryan: happy Memorial Day 😁 Also Ryan: he said thank you 😀
Chubby
The poses though
Get sunscreen
I love this. But I can't believe they refund him for the cooler after he's dragged it miles and over sand! The retailer I work for wouldn't do that
Im currently in my IT embedded system 3rd semester exams, after seeing this video. Ima dip out of uni and sell some WATER
how did bro sell water for $2.00 my local shop sells it for 60 cents lmao
is this in los angeles santa monica?
I love you Ryan!!!
IM WATCHING THIS FOR THE SECOND TIME AND NOW I REALISE......... YOU DIDNT SLAP THE BURIT😡
Spread the gospel
Spread the gospel
O soda=epic fail
Yuh homie broke 9 mil!
Water seller
😝so fun to watch
Bro traded a cooler 3 times
Love your videos
I'm shocked that Los Angeles is cheaper than NYC
You should have said “COLD WATER” for my attention.
Anyone remember LETS GO TOMMY from ep 1
11:12 THE GREAT RESET
let's go the 🐐 MrWhoseTheBoss donated
What happens to ur bike
RYAN!!!! CONGRATS ON 9M SUBS!!! Hope it makes your day just like it makes mine :)
GET SUNSCREEEENNNN!! IM GOING TO CRYYYYY PLEASEEEE

if he is surviving on 1 penny, how does he have an iphone 13 / 12+ 12:17
Buy a card reader!
I'm hoping you try hitchhiking or freight train hopping at some point of the journey.
The thumbnail!!! HAHAHAHAHA!!!
Yay 6.9 million views...xd
Lesson learned if you want money just sell overpriced waters..
1:02 IS THIS WHERE THE SHAMPOO PRANK HAPPEND
You need sunscreen
My Boo Isaiah photo donate $5,000 sheeeesg
Where does he charge his phone?
8:09 me counting my bday money
✨ incredible ✨
moral of the story “when life gives you 0.01 you sell water”
I love how he said i will eat this in 2.1 seconds but it took 5 seconds
i donated a penny
Oh I'm loving this series!! I wish I could come down there and give you a 100 bucks.
donate 10mil moneys lol
you're so funny naturally
When that guy wouldn’t move for you even when you said ‘imagine I fell off’ 😄
💯💯💯
PLS GET SOME SUNSCREEN
morning
Ryan: “One word Burrito time” Me: “But that’s two tho”
All of the 30 days are you trying to get to MrBeast in all those days
how did you make so much! :0
I subscribed ❤
Man this guy is working so damn hard, absolutely legendary
His not funny jokes are so funny.
Just subscribed! Love what ur doing, keep it up!
hola joe....HOME
"ICE" Cold Water would be better on sign
Ryan looks like a mom with a strong jaw line while laying down
just do this a few days and buy a plain ticket ;)
keistas pacas :D
yo ryan love the vids, if u want to make money and protect it from the great reset you should consider buying a paypal giftcard or something like that, since it’s technically considered an item like the chipotle giftcard!
he's really doing great thing in life
bro, you are gonna get skin cancer, watch out pls. use sunscreen bruh
Man VS America😆
of course the mexican on the bike wanted to haggle. $2 man? holy shit that's too much! Dude you're in LA. you could charge $5.
how they accept that used cooler, with sand in the wheels..  back in the store is crazy
Anyone realise that the group of girls said they wanted 5 bottles of water but he only got $6 ???
Overprice?nah He Peddle You dont need to look for a store he do it for you so you saying that doesn't Cost nahhh
Bro just go to some sketchy alleyway and buy some sketchy teleporter for $5 and teleport yourself to mrbeast
this dude is playing sims 4 irl
I love how he can return the cooler
that or $2 was to high of a price for it. unless that is the normal price. here a can would be no more than 75 cents and a bottle  $1/1.50  but that was in a like 2019 so it could of went up some I guess.
One word  TACO TIME 😀😀😀😀
In 1.25x you sound like jesse eisenberg
Are a nice person and I think you can do this
You should invest in some stable stock or crypto like Bitcoin or buy vids gift cards so when the great reset comes you have money at your fingertips
bro wtf just shoulda used rideshare....
It’s sad that you make light of “the great reset” if you listen to Klaus Schwab it would be such a joke…
Amazing bro
I’m loving this series and for a great cause
Bro you earned a new sub
This might be dum but didnt he give the penny for a dolar?
PEOPLE IN LA ARE SO NICE :')
Surprising how none askes if he wants change, when they do they just pay the full
In albania🇦🇱 water is 3 cent
I whipped it out so fast
If I keep unsubscribing and resubscribing, does that count as another penny???😂😂
i am commenting on every episode so it will get more views because this is a great cause
Bro 6 for a burrito?!?! Where I live it's 10-11 bucks no wayy

Whil watching this I realised thst this is about the perfect way to adventure around this area, this way you get to meet all the people, feel the vibes, see all around. This is fking amazing
Genius idea!

For anyone wondering… Ryan has earned $335.53, and spent $224.78 so far!
this is very sus k
Heeeeey it’s the Hooman showers!
Bruh He said one word burrito time
The people he be seeing out here are mainly kind.
Good work man
u ate it in 4 sec not 2.1
RYAN IM BRYAN RYAN
Isn’t he paying his editor and cameraman tho?
We need a THE GREAT RESET COUNTER
Wait how he pay for the ticket if he only got cash🧍🏻
whare ryan keep the bike wen he use the cooler
Ryan trayhan in 2030 be like:1 cent challenge canadian addition
As someone who lives in LA I feel like that 55% of those people were tourist
really need to know how your chipotle burrito was under $7 in LA
When you make more money selling water than doing doordash you know there's a problem hahahahah
Never say howdy in LA  😂😂
Nice job keep it up. P.S it’s not really correct to say “Happy” memorial Day.
Where is you past cooler?
THE GREAT RESET!
Ryan’s attempts to be cool make me laugh so hard when he was selling the water! Great content, well done!
It took 4 seconds to eat that burito
What Chipotle in LA sells a burrito for 6.84? I’m thinking it’s more like double that
Ryan I personally would sell the water for 1.50$ and not for 2$
fact that he dont need water (god of thirst)
At the end of the month he needs to make those shoes an nft. And sell it to the highest bidder.
Love your vids keep on pushing
Bro this series literally brings me joy
i noticed how he's shorter than an average american male
Sell soda amd water
Quinn my guy 🤦‍♂️ let’s go tommy!
It’s so tempting to donate 50k
penny
6:17 How have I not heard about dogs in sidecars until now?
I'm absolutely in love with a melody between the shots!!
Today i subscribed!
For some countries is consider illegal by selling water outdoor without a proper paper work that saying you are able to sell .
After working whole day a simple snack just tastes epic
LOS A G L A S!
When he was selling water I Was like “I neeeeed water”
The only two goated series on youtube rn  *This and ARJ's ULTRA VEGITO* 🙏🏻
You probably wont see this message, but if you do I want you to know that I don't usually subscribe to youtubers such as yourself or even watch content like what you would normally do but I'm so excited for this series that I had to sub. Also, Im really happy that you are putting in the effort to make the small amount of money
The way he started with a pen 😳
Wait so he just left his bike there while he sold water
5:22 is any one nit going to see that man naked
Он наконец-то посрал!
I hope to be like you one day! You love God and is not afraid to share it. You are a wonderful person and so funny! Thank you for sharing your adventures!
Still spamming:)
Let's go Tommy
Let's go Tommy
Let's go Tommy
Let's go Tommy
Let's go Tommy
Bro i always wondered how his phone never dies-
You are a lovely awkward man 😂
Dude, it's LA, you could have legit sold Fiji for $10 a pop.
Nice vlogs
God bless everyone and have a nice day and Jesus Christ loves you all and I do too and pray bye.
Nobody here is talking about the fact that he showed an april fools article. At the end of that article it says, quote “And if you haven’t figured it out by now – Happy April Fools Day!”. The penny is not going away (even though maybe it should).
Saw y'all counting money, thought it was a drug deal 💀
James 3:10 From the same mouth come blessing and cursing. My brothers, these things ought not to be so. (Also Jesus is king God is king.)
Props to the camera man ‼️‼️
Lets go tommy
WOW I LOVE THIS GUY! God bless you.
pin me ryan
What did you order at Chipotle for under $7?  I cannot get out of there under $9!  And I don't get the extras!
Ok so Ryan here is kinda a tip so don’t go to the beach to sell stuff cuz normally people don’t have money with thwm
That is sooooo insane. It’s like you bought the water for less and sold it for a profit. How come nobody thought of those before??!!?!??? 😱
Can't donate but subscribed
if you guys wanna find a perfect way to describe his awkwardness, just say Peter Parker awkward.
Today I learned selling water at a beach In Cali pays more than DoorDash on a bike
I loved this vid
Could you not take the bike on the bus? Do they not have a way to stow the bike?
La wants just wadr
how did he get such a cheap chipotle burrito?!?
Pretty funny that you're feeding america with doordash while having a fundraiser to feed america.. Anyway, love the videos keep it up.
Bro made as much as I do at Walmart selling water at the beach.
Next epic trip.. I would like a fresh raspberry from the wilderness in alaska. lol
A burrito is 6.84 in LA???? I call shenanigans, a chicken burrito is over 8 dollars where I live!
life is strange 2 Vibes
Ryan exposed himself when he said “happy” Memorial Day
I couldn’t complain about the $2 like this man is wearing a sign, rolling a heavy cooler, and is being awkwardly funny😂
Come on man you got this!
bro ur videos are so addicating but I don't have time to watch them:(
This is one of the most realistic challenges I've ever watched & enjoyed on YT
Something about him makes me like him despite the pain from cringe.
comment
For some reason you remind me of Gordon Ramsay🦙
My mom get 120$ in a month and you get in 2 days 😑
11:12 11:13
Ryan is underrated
God bless everyone and have a nice day and Jesus Christ loves you all and I do too and pray bye.
this is such a good series
Why is there only 1 comment
in Pakistan you can by 4 water bottles in one dollar
im not from america so i dont know these things butttt how come you can return a used item at rite aid? like even without a reasonable reason to do so??
I subscribed!
Если переводить на рубли, то 2$ за воду это много 😐
An airplane ticket would be cheaper then a hotel anyways
sick 🔥
I’m just seeing all the places I shot up in gta lol
I never would have thought you could essentially live from just chilling in LA.
I'm from Italy and I'm the founder of a project that it would change my life. I'd love to talk to you and to @mrbeast for a collaboration. Please reach me out
And sprite
You deserve the money you earnedchard and you worked hard to sell water coca cola
Again how dose your phone charge and how is your cloths ALWAYS clean
the most suspicious strangest thing is the cooler getting returned everytime.
*inserts inspiring speech about take deep breaths*   3 seconds later…   🚴💨💨💨💨
Never gets borongt
YouTuber/Water Salesman

He have red eyes
"The great reset..."
He is amazingly inspiring. LOVE IT,
This is honestly the most creative and fun to watch initiative on YouTube I've seen! You're doing so much good with it and You spread so much positivity with Your personality. Thank You for doing so and good luck!
Now I'm genuinely curious if $2 is too much for a water, I'm not from America xd
God bless god loves you
this guy should be a business man like bro…but without the *awkwardness*
You needed to sell the water for $1.50. More people will want to buy that and most of them won’t want change and tell you to keep it.
Why you using girl deodorant my dude lol
If he sold water like this is Florida when I was there we would buy like 50
1.00 frozen popsicle sticks, the flavored ones. Lol
episode 1?
this man is the definition of crypto currency
Say bob
skip to 5:23
I know the kid with the 49er shirt
1:44 gta apartment
Damn..I should do this for a business
The guy that came back and said “that’s cheap for a water!” Absolutely amazing 🙏
I just realized he bought woman’s deodorant 😂
“Yeah John, this guys back. I think he’s here to return that cooler again”
now i fell like i should walk around my town selling water only problem is that there are drinking fountains every where but the are broken
Yo he in gta
so many ppl are so kind
one day Ryan that hammock is going to snap
lol he shouldve done that a couple more days in a row and just flown there lmfao this series is pretty good so far
So what happens if I spam unsubscribe and subscribe? Does it not count, or do you get a lot of pennies?
I don’t understand how they allow a return on a clearly used cooler- not once but twice!
where'd u put the cooler when you were on ur bike / doordashin?
imagine he fell off da bike XDDDDD SO FANNY LMAO (laughing out loud)
imagine he fell off XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
So in usa you can rental a brand new cooler from a store?
I subscribed 😄
great way to show people its easy top make money if you just try
Hes cheating he used an iPhone
Reset should be 25k
pls tell me he buys sunscreen the next day
This makes me believe we still have good people in America
Jesus love you ! And he will provide 😆🫶🏼
This is one of the most sweetest men  I’ve ever see
bro! three days and still no sunscreen???
Ryan: “Good Morning Sleepyheads” What if we’re watching at night😏 I know he’s saying good morning to himself I’m just saying
This is Casey Neistat’s son
I work at a grocery store and where I live 40 waters is one dollar LOL u could make hella profit here
3:31 ''prices way too high. i just got the karen vibe from this lady. sure there is Water WAY less expensive but its not easy to get that cold water. as you can see he spent over 40 dollars getting it. besides if you think the price is way too high you can just go to your local supermarket. OH WAIT you are lazy and expect things to be delivered to you at the same price as if you would actually put in energy walking to the store''. and even more proof saying its not THAT bad is in the previous videos. where people had no problem paying the money and even giving a tip.
Please buy sunscreen
I love how its all legit
i love seeing capitalism in action
Angelinos
+0.01 $
0:00 : as in the stranger things scene right?
I added a penny
It’s crazy to think what we can actually achieve if we really want to…
looks away for one second- *goes from $3 to $40*
Since when is a chipotle burrito $7?🧐
tO tHe gRoAsHeReE sToRe 😊
Ryan makes me feel less anxious about being so awkward, he’s so unforgivably himself.
The scene when he almost got rob is so funny🤣😂
Why don't you ride with bike to your destination :DDDDd?
what is in yo burrito
you are so kind
this is litterally such a good series
So he could have bought sunscreen, instead bought gum lmao
Crazy c:
6:39 it is become the most played part in the video wtf :D
Gulp gulp gulp. Lol 😆
Hey its me (again)x2
The dirt on your lip is killing me 🤣🤣
What’s so cool about this journey is it brings back the appreciation of the grind and the result.  Making $100 selling water…ANYONE can do that and feel good about it
yo buy the whole bus
Love how confident yet awkward you are lol, keep doing good things man!
I love this I I watched all of them and liked
Who's recording him?
If you do this in Germany, you will get a ticket, a bill for the Taxes and maybe a jail visit ;)
✝️❤️❤️❤️
this is like Minecraft when you start from a wooden tools to a diamond tools
1:01
1:00
Buy sun screen
A good example of what u can earn with your own f*** brain and not working for 10$ a hour for a asshole!! Get some inspiration from that guy!👍🏼💪🏼
9970th omg 😮🤯😱😱
Bruh where is your big buisness company?
I have a few questions. Who is cutting and uploading the Videos? And Who is the Cameraman?
Hahhahah
Trumpest? Eh trump2024

LOL i was there at venice beach that day watching the body building comp. Totally missed him
Yo this needs to be a playlist
I really don't understand why you bought a cooler 2 times.
I’ve only just started watching these vids

how do you get away with buying and returning that cooler in the same store 3 days in a row lol
Will be praying for you Ryan 🙏🏽
Not sure if he has done this later on, but he should wait outside a school and sell ice cream when it gets out.
I subbed bro. Feed someone who needs it for me! Your amazing 👏
Ty man. Reminder to breathe and ty God. 😊 just what I needed
well i cant donate but i feel good knowing my sub on the last video is worth a meal. cant wait to see were this journey takes you.
Man, that guy in the Lakers jersey was dope
That Lakers guy is Filipino HAHAHA
Wait why didn't you do door dash on day 3? Epic day still!
bro selling 2$ water but with 3$ more you can get 40 lol
i love you
Your current inventory is: HAMMOCK, BIKE, “OTHER NECESSITIES”
I have counted this guy said “Cheers” 67 times this episode
Commenting on all the penny videos till Ryan says happy birthday to me on the 16th day of the penny adventure and my birthday 🥳
I love this series
If I ever became home,ess, this is what I’d do fr
Whoever’s reading this, I pray that whatever your going through gets better and whatever your struggling with our worrying about is going to be fine and that everyone has a fantastic day! Amen
Think I'm gonna move to the beach and sell water screw 9-5
Boost the algorithm
MAN. you make it seem so easy to survive in the outside world !
You remind me of a young Charlie Bartlett
the most heartwarming part about this series is seeing how it brings out the kindness and humanity in so many strangers
Can This Guy Even Go To the smallest island on earth i think (Yap)
“Imagine I fell off.” 😂😂😂😂😂
In five minutes he has got back to where he has started
i have a lote of pennys shod i donate.
Did you forget to tell me about the great reset😂
Your doing great so far!
This man made more selling water than doordashing
"are you sure, idk if i have change" dude has change and full knowledge of every bill and coin he has. THIS GUYS A GREAT BIG PHONEY
Having not been to America before we didn't know what to expect, but to our pleasant surprise, the people there are ultra friendly just as seen in Ryan's videos. Love to visit again some day.
Did he really said happy Memorial Day? Lol 😂
Please
Cheese
Ojay
Santa Monica is not L.A. 😁
One thing I think would be a good idea is that he could’ve kept the cooler and then used it as a trailer on his bike so he can do things easier
I will say that walking might be smart but it could be easier to just sit because the waves of people walking would probably rush through his stock of water
Who ever heard of the word supercalifragilisticexpialidocious?
i feel like he’s going to Vegas
how was chipotle less than $7???
All I learned is that I'm going to start selling water
All the unshelthered people looking on how to make money or travel be lookin here
richer is my hero
The fact that I can pick up 40 pack of water and I’m ten he’s in his 20s and can barely do lol
I don't get it how you can return used cooler if it works fine. No such thing in europe, unless its warranty case or unused.
10:11 that was 4
I  love what you're  doing and made me donate seeing you're working hard surviving for a great cause keep up the great work !
what does emo mean?
I love when he borrows the cooler
The coller comes for some store
You gained a new sub!!!
This dude is definitely getting paid to say nice things about DoorDash.
I like Ryan with facial hair
Sussy boka
Not only is Ryan traveling America off a penny, he’s also raising money for charity!
People gonna be put there selling waters for a $1 for a living now
Koop aid gummmmm
i've had so many negative experiences surrounding religion especially for not being religious myself even though it only reflects my own beliefs and not how i treat or view others, so its nice seeing religion used as a tool for gratitude and introspection rather than judgment on others. i think religion can be so good at inspiring people and spreading hope so i think its beautiful to see it having that purpose as opposed to how i've seen it in the past.
Pause at 13:06
Stan the water man's secret brother
uhu
*needs to save every penny*  *pays $7 for a burrito*  bruh you're in fucking LA lmao there is cheap amazing mexican food everywhere
I would buy the soda
What about motels? They are cheaper
One of the people/fan Ryan *I'm Bryan Ryan*
This is business (☉｡☉)
Hey rayan do any pose in the great reset you don't look embarrassing you look good
what people are complaining about, in here in Norway a pint of water costs 3 or 4 dollars.
you filmed this on my birthday it was may 30
Day 3
You should’ve bought the water at the 99 cent store
Should wait until the bodybuilding contest is over those guys will buy your whole stock lol
Now that I'm thinking about it he should have sold gum XD
This series is wholesome
my brother was having surgery on the day this video was recorded
Why do people in California wear hoodies to the beach? Is it cold? Is it hot? What is going onnnn 😂
Your so committed!!
Ryan is so wholesome
when i subed it changed from 8.34 m to 8.35 m
0:20
“Bad financial decision” u made like 80 bucks tho😭
7.10 bruh just speak like what😂
Hey Ryan, great video, although i was wondering if you had a discord server? And if not, would i be able to make you one?? Keep up the good work!
Fun fact: If you just work for 3 days in a supermarket, you make more...
It is kinda crazy that ppl bought $2 water from u
Man people are letting him Have the money because has a sunburn and they thought that you didn’t get any sales
Lol you can make more than people with jobs
‘waters’
This whole series is capitalism
I didnt know hotel prices were to high in my place the cheapest hotel is 16 dollars
i need that phone case
"Sodas so cold its colder than my ex wives heart" forever will remember when he said that cause it was halarious
Why do you call people brother? You not a nigga
Hey guys is coin legit?
Whoever’s reading this, I pray that whatever your going through gets better and whatever your struggling with or worrying about is going to be fine and that everyone has a fantastic day! Amen
I love the water selling meta
WEAR DIFFERENT SOCKS WHEN YOU SLEEP - sweat is why they are cold at night dude.. to bad theres no hope you see this.  - Edit 10:35 I took 3 breaths, wholesome
ok im going to ask  in theory can we unsubscribe and resubscribe to give a cent ?
Amazing content
God bless yall yall have a purpose in and respect
Tbh ik this is entertaining and thats the reason for prolonging it and taking the bus but im pretty sure he could get a plane ticket for easily $400 or less from cali to at least Iowa but none the less I enjoy the watch
Idk what this guy on about sofa made a decent amount of money should have got pop and water with two coolers would of been the play
THE GREAT RESET WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM
these kinds of videos remind me that their is faith in humanity:)
No offense but the fact that this man embarrasses himself infront of an entire block of people inspires me
I will never buy a cooler without questioning it’s backstory again lol
8:44 is the building from gta
I love the fact you are taking the cooler back 😂😂
4:58 xD the backround
He’s so funny 😭
I keep wondering why you aren’t sweating and completely greasy and nasty. But then I remember it’s California. Stand outside in Florida for 10 minutes and your soaked, hair looks like you haven’t showered in a week and your skin looks like a pan after Gordon Ramsay sautéd a steak
And put water for a dollar and cokes for 2 and beer for 3 because beer is expensive
Nobody:   Ryan: *silence*... "YES"
If u want to make more money out there buy cokes water and beer
Your awkwardness makes this challenge more entertaining I think! Everyone is alittle awkward sometimes such is life.
BRO SCAMMED HIM
He pretty much just borrows the cooler
coulda drank the melted ice
1 word burrito time-😏
next series being I survived 1 year with a penny
:D I love ur vids Im really happy u make vids if u never did i might be dead.. i hope that was not violent to much............
It is interesting to see that selling water and soda is more profitable than doordash.
At 2:08 he has $15.69 Lol (Bc he has 69c)
Imagine jimmy is watching this secretly
Keep going Ryan let’s goooo
this man is the human embodiment of god
Was that Quinn
First time watching your YouTube, 3 episodes down and I'm addicted, good content man
THIS VID MADE ME SO HAPPY FOR NO REASON🤧
It’s funny how he makes so much more money selling water and sodas then door dash
I thought for sure I was subscribed, but I guess not… this is the best time to subscribe!
You can thank me, i dont have 50k to donate.
Dobu think u could stop in nebraska for me
H$2.O would make a cool sign for selling water if the water is $2 each
most of the money was spent on the cooler anyway. Edit: OMG epic cooler strat?!
Can you explain to me how waters are more popular than soda, like a lot more popular
bro i love this i been so board lately this just sloved it im on summer break :} keep it up ryan
Guy ur a legend
Go watch mrwhosetheboss's videos, he's one of the guys who donated and he produces great content!
This is a perfect example of how capitalism works. Ryan turned 1 cent into more that 100 dollars + all the things he bought in only 3 days. He achieved that satisfying other people's needs without the necessity to rob anyone
Here to see how the peak design v2 backpack holds up
bro your lying you didnt eat it in 2.1 seconds unsubscribing
LETS GO TOMMY
I just wanna know who people react when they see a man following a guy with a humongous camera
I found this series on accident and I'm absolutely loving it
WE NEED A QUIN
KEEP GOING Do it 4 Dennis
I’m now addicted to watching this
Where is his bike
im dead he returned the cooler. no wonder retail is failing
Why doesn’t this guy save up 200 dollars and buy a plane ticket across America
They say two dollars is to much in Norway a water bottle is 30kr/3 dollars and everyone is ok with it
I love this series but was wondering do you need a permit to sell water in public?
Broke $100 let’s gooooo
Life's amazing, I'm gonna eat this burrito, tonight... is the night…  that we buy a bus ticket                                                                                                                                                                 -Ryan 2022
Not sub😣 sub 😁
For a sec I thought that you only bought water and it cost the 6
I subscribed
2:46 you should've added flavoring packets for a how much ever extra idk u do u
You are amazing
No sunscreen still!! I'm not letting it go 😆 PS how did it go from $57.40 to $83.40 when the man forgot to pay you for the 💦 What he gave you $26? Don't mind me I did just well enough in math to get into college then my gf did my math hw & test (good ol online classes)
best nomad ive ever seen!
I find it crazy how he made more money selling water on the street than doordashing lmao
It's to hard to living with 00.01 omg
It would be so cool to be with ryan on these
I'm always shitting on America but I feel like the people might be more fun to be around than in Europe. I like the chill
He now has more money than me but I'm just a kid right now and this series is making my day
the thing I like about him is he’s awkward XD
8:47 i cant stop wheezing
hi
Türkiyede olsa üstüne para vermek yerine adamı dövüp suları alıp kaçarlar
Did he really sleep outside?  I have a feeling he is sleeping inside the van that is following him.  What do you think ?
I commit federal crimes on a daily basis
We Really appreciate You Buddy! Keep it up! ✌🏼
1 penny to 110 pounds  in day 3!? INSANE
Ayyeeeee you used an iPhone to book the bus ticket
Bro I'm 13 and I got facial hair before u I believe in u tho
Ryan is the type of guy to not know what cussing is.
You could make 3 THOUSAND DOLLARS each month if you for this lucky everyday
I would donate but I don't have dollars so I don't think I can sorry
the way you can literally make $35 an hour selling water at venice beach and you can't make more than $15 working your ass off in the food industry
Great video
Great video
owh
the bike is back
wait- where did the bike go?
let's all just appreciate the vibey music in the back
1 MILLION MEAL BABYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
I gave you a 'penny'
at minute 6:00 an actor from dhar mann appears :0
Me who bought 45 water bottles for 2 dollars   😈  And this guy spent 5 for 12
The "I don't think I have change" line makes a killing
He’s videos are so funny
I live in Fiji
It is crazy where someone can get with just 1 penny. And you symbolizing that just makes me believe how much potential one man can accomplish
I love how he just randomly says “to protect us from… THE GREAT RESET
$6.84 for a chipotle burrito ???? Why so cheap 😭
8:57 as a roblox player that gives me war flashbacks
so did Ryan return the same cooler 2 times? haha if so thats awesome
Lol.
Lol your so funny
GOD will always Love you
Door dash < water
when he said he was gonna eat the burrito in 2 secs it  was actually 4 secs
One dollar for ice cold water on the beach if you haven’t got anything already is a great price that guy doesn’t know what he’s talking about lmao
XD
Anyone realise at the end of the video it says ISAIAH PHOTO DONATED 5000$ AT THE END OF THE VIDEO WHAT A LEGEND !
So grateful I didn't watch ep 2 to the latest one, now I can bingewatch all the other eps let's GOOOOO
poo poo but head hat
it's interesting that the kindness of letting ryan keep the change is helping feed thousands of people
7:07
Hi
It’s so heartwarming what he’s doing ☺️☺️
I love content for a cause. Great idea!
Bro is playing life on hard mode lol
I love your videos Ryan! Love from Hungary <3
What u should do is 2 for one bottle for 5 for 3 bottles
The taste test made me laugh
I Subscribed 7 months ago, keep up the good work, I’m your biggest fan and I love your content, your so selfless and engaging.
I realize how you’re gonna pee?
I don’t think maths is his strong subject
waiting for you to get here (pa)! wish you luck <3
It's a sad day when you can make more money off of selling water than door dash.
am sick and i just found this series i. love. it heartwarming :}
Day 3 was the most chaotic. You made more profit than I thought you would! And I like how u keep buying and returning the same cooler lol
Ryan is emo 🖤😢
HOLD UP 6.84 FOR THE B URRITO?>! MY CHIPOTLE CHARGES LIKE 8-11 FOR ONE T_T
On day 10 he resets 🤯
What is in that burrito
Not only is Ryan doing the impossible, he's raising tons of money for charity and inspiring another generation of entrepreneurs.
Him returning the cooler is the best hustle of the video lmao
sell beer
his smile is so bright it makes my day
Bougth water for 5 selling it for about 80
just me wondering where is the bike?
LETS GO TIMYYYYYYY!
7:58

Where he edit video
next time if u do like these clallenges try to do these challenges in India
Burryto time :D
How are you charging your phone??
The beach reminds me of the Gta 5 beach
America bus ticket to 1 city = 28 dollars     Germany : 9 Euro to get to every city in whole germany    And 9 Euro are like 9.45 dollars
1:15 DO THE GRIDDY
you made more money selling water than soda you even cut the price of the soda
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand
Ryan looks kinda northern european
Day 3 of watching ryan
I think this is the best video I've ever watched on YouTube
You should grow a beard through this serious
the camera did a great help
Leaving a comment in every single episode day 3
Ok.
"Im Bryan-Brian,Ryan" I BURSTED OUT LAUGHING
God bless you
I am too materialistic to do something like this :D
232k!!!
Where did u put ur bike
My man found an infinite money glitch with some water bottles
This is actually a perfect video to learn entrepreneurship.
~dabs~              D A              G R E A T             R E S E T                   (INTENSE MUISC)
that... that's a pretty good way of making money  oh my go-
love your idea of donating <3
ryan you could have sold milk americans love that (I'm Australian)
I figured it out! You remind me of Francis from Malcolm in the Middle, but you are a much tamer person. Thank you for the nostalgia!
We all should be a little bit more like Ryan
He returns the cooler 🤣
THIS IS MY DAY 1 WATCHING YOUR DAY 3 SURVIVAL❤️
THIS IS MY DAY 1 WATCHING YOUR DAY 3 SURVIVAL❤️
“i just want to call everyone a damelio” 😂😂
this game is like a simulator and when you buy a bus ticket you rebirth and keep some off your items
5:10 was from gta5 😂😂😂
Day 3 of asking what shorts you are wearing and where I can get some. Can u drop the link or name ! thanks, great series also!
how he get chipotle for $6???
I sud right now to you
Ryan: I told you I could grow facial hair!! Me: Im 14 and I have a better mustache than you.  In my opinion mustaches look creepy unless its from an adult and will prob shave it soon
I honestly love that so many people are so kind in all these vids. It makes me feel a little better about us humans.
Did you return the cooler again?
I did not know Abraham Lincoln had a twin 🤯
i like how my man went from 8$  to 103 🤣
Bruh how did he get chipotle for 7$
“Cheers”
Bro I live in ohio I made 745$ at a car show  selling pops
I subscribed
If i was able to donate 100,000 dollars i would tell you to get a tattoo of all the BTS member. (BTS is a korean boy band by the way) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ALSO KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK.
He made more money then I do in one day
106 watch naruto
I learned selling water is better money than doordashing lol
Who else is waiting to donate 50k 🤣🤘
Dont quite understand the cooler return thing is this only in america? In belgium(europe) when you buy something and its faulty you get a new one when it happened within the written date as insurance with the receit. But once youve used it you cant return it for your money.
Go Ryan go go
No one notice he got chipotle burrito for $6???
This is an excellent mis titling of a video, praise be for youthful deceit.
Ryan would have a heart attack if someone donates $49,999.99
It was amazing to see so many good people in the community help out
am i the only one that is thinking about his phone battery???
I thought when he was buying the cooler he said twenty… nah I’ll just give you a ten 😂🤣 im so dumb loll
What happens if somebody does not want u to reset so they donate 49,99$
when the dude tried to negotiate the water price but then ended up paying more than double after hearing the cause
Stranger:Your prices are too high you need to cut them Ryan: cuts to $1 Stranger:no im good
"I was trying to get some attention. I think I just got a rash." 💀💀💀
inwould of kept the cooler because you could buy drinks and put it in there for the bus
I'm genuinely curious and I hope no one takes it the wrong way, but how do you charge all of your electronics including your phone to continue to use it?
5:50 yeah
5:49 no they are 2pac
Hes so cute omg 🫶🫶
I am Donate my First YouTube Income  And My All YouTube Income 20% Every Time...   promise 🥰🥰🥰
I want to do that 🤣
I love how people are this kind to you :)

You are literally my favorite I love you and your cute
You will also find money
Keep it up
Let’s  go TOMMYYYYYYYY!
How did he get new clothes? Is he allowed to get clean clothes
I LOVE THIS SERIES
Idk what to comment
I love the background music 😭 makes me feel nostalgic for some reason
One word: Californian
Someday I wanna be able to spend $2 on a water
DANG YOU HAVE A LOT OF BROTHERS
i was one of the pepole there
Sir your eyes in the end of the video we’re red when you were like looking right so it scared me for like a second is that camera effect
are you not worried about anyone stealing the money whilst your asleep?
Respect for the kid at 5:23 who has a Demon Slayer shirt.
At 3:17 I thought it was HIM
and i thought i was socially awkward
🥨
ryan you are insane
U should’ve sold oat milk that would sell out in minutes but like it’s too late now loll
This is awesome! Btw I do not get how that cooler return thing works, can someone explain by any chance?
I heard him fart
I have your same cooler at my house
These videos give me so much hope in people seeing how kind everyone is to you
if a GREAT RESET comes will be throw away or donate all of the previous money you had?
ryan this is an amazing series you're doing a fabulous job thanks!!
11:10
one thing he should have looked into for lodging while traveling for low cost is hostels
5:16 I was just going to reach for my bottle of water and he said that and my want for water was increased by 99%
That beach reminds me of the beach in GTA
This is call Business.
Wow 5 dollers 40 waters turned into alot more
1 penny for a sub. Post on Reddit for troll-related bankruptcy.
Great initiative - You could also try feeding other places as many people are working on America atm!
i like your hair
good job
Idiots on the beach buying water when the largest water source on the planet is inches away from them😂😂
Ryan: And I’m gonna finish this burrito in 2 seconds  Me: He sped it up and it still wasn’t 2 seconds?
sell drugs
Can we do one for FeedingWorld
Bro just casually sells water to a guy with a frickin blade attached to his pants 5:31
Ryan u are a great guy! im in love with these "series"! so insiring! Keep it up!
If you can make 100$ a day selling water just do it everyday then buy a plane ticket
i like ur cute hair
@loganpaul
@thegrefg
@ksi
I’m confused, don’t you need a license to sell stuff ?
12:58 the eyes thoug

Ha ha you deserve it,,!! The guy not giving you the $20!!! Bc the guy thought that you were broke!,!

Bro I remember when you had 2 Million subscribers!Keep up the great work!👍
i think i might start selling water
What is the name of the background music u used? Its cool to hear it
5:32  Marabunta Grande from GTA
The absolute raw hustle is so incredible. It's so genuine.
Letz goooooo day 3
He could've just sold the coolers for. A bit higher price
Sponsored by : water 💦
8:44 that’s my gta apartment
who else is down to go and sell water on the beach? xD
Not to be a hater since this is for a good cause, but "buying" coolers w/ the intent to return it is basically just stealing from the store (obv they can't sell a used cooler).
It’s not akward
Howdy! but shit I'm in California not Texas! awkward! with the sterotypes  A penny to what you have Keep on Keep'n on
NOBODY BETTER PAY HIM TO DO GREAT RESET HE WORKED HARD PLS DONT
Who has a microscope got me laughing out of my mind
Did no body else see his pupils change color. 13:06
I think he should sell the bike for 45 $ because he is using a bus
CONGRATS ON 8 MIL
dude this is quite possibly the best example of american oportunity
done subscribe
ur so kind 😀😀😀
same song 50 times
Why isn’t anyone talking about the great graphics of this game
How the hell does he return a used cooler like that? The wheels can't look new after a whole day of rolling it around everywhere
if you're coming to colorado, i'm gonna try to meet up with you. no doubt about it.
I just watched him reach 8M tf
No hate or anything  I just find it funny how using women's deodorant
Omg he lost $18 im so stressed
So he going to make 30 video?  since he daily vlog his editor and camera are insane
Burrito time! I'm a bowl man myself. Really positive!
Bruder hol einfach 9€ Ticket LOL
Great
I rlly like his laugh and how he actually puts how it sounds hgggh
I love how selling water got better sales then doordash
Wait a second. Aren't those showers the same place those people did the shampoo pranks?
2:04 Jarritos are my favourite!
8M🏆
5:45 that is not a bike that is a horse
I'm 13 and I have as much facial hair as him. My friends definitely have more than him too
8:43 he walked past my gta online home💀
Him: One-word burrito time Me: That 2 words tho
I loved it at 10:37  🙏🏻
Okay, but how does he charge stuff?
2 words actually, 8:56
$5,000 for a verbal thank you when people donating $1 are getting a verbal thank you too😂
When she said 6.84 I almost died. I was literally at chipoltle at the time and I paid 12.50 for a burrito no extra toppings
how do you use the bathroom
Water is better then work!
Can we just think about how much effort he puts into his videos
still in la :I
That’s a lot of money from just water
Imagine this but prostitution is allowed
The one Ryan series without peppermint
Ryan after he counts the money: IDK WHAT TO DO                                                                                                             Me: BUY SOME SUNSCREEN
Did anyone hear him fart not to be rude
return the cooler is a smart move… but, not good for that store business.. 😀
This is fantastic😂 The perfect person to be out and about trying to sell water😅
this just shows with hard work comes great rewards.
next time you sell water .. sell them for 2$ but 3 for 5$
When it’s hot people crave water more for sure! I LOVE an ice cold water on a hot day
It’s funny that there are deodorant commercials on this video.  Lol
the shop: he returned this cooler but it looks like it's been dragged along the city all day
He should've ate the burrito sideways 🤣
watch out for tax collectors
just curious how he got chipotle for $7
weird to think u made more money than my parant smake in a day
Fun fact the more hydrated u are the more like intelligence easier to respond dificult question use that ryan and i bet it willl help u or idk
Ryan,you’re gonna be a legend when these thirty days are over
your titles literally contradict every video lol...
Mn se fosse no Brasil o cara tava fudido nesse desafioKKKKKK
Wait in LA a burrito and drink at potle is less than 7? It's like 10 -12 here in Omaha. That surprises me
i love how he doesnt mention the 100k donation
I did the three breathes and thank God and it's amazing
The number of water salesmen at the beaches are going to skyrocket after these videos haha
i love ur videos broski
Returning the cooler is kinda ethically questionable after all the wear and tear
Great Job MAN
Tbh i can see ryan with a beard or a mustache.
He makes living on the streets look easy
The fact that when I was watching this video and he was doordashing my door dash came
"That's an expensive water, haha ;-;"
ya
U have to remember Quinn my guy
Sus 0:20
“Ryan Bryan Ryan”
I added 0.1 dollars ✌🏻
8:43 THAT IS A GTA HOUSE!
Hey Ryan, my birthday is on june 14, i would be very happy if i got a happy birthday from you or anyone in fact. im glad you are helping people. thank you and i hope this challange is good. like every year
air Jordan Olympics 7 "love of games" size 9 70% off at flight club nyc. firsf come first serve. market high 2k. selling $400+. Used box only, boarding shoe

ME
does anybody else feel bothered that he used up all the wheels and the cooler and then returned it?? Little cringe, ngl
If I had money I would donate most of it to you
I love your vids
I love your vids :) you're the best bro !
Watermelon will take over
Lair the kool aid gum has no flavor
Yay! Go Ryan!! God is with you ♡
comment #3
When you know the top 2 creators on the end of the video board:
7:10 they just didn’t speak
Bruh in 2x speed he ate the burrito in 3 seconds so in fast motion it was six
Commenting until ryan reply and shout out
10:41 and 10:53 was so cute 🥺❤ he's so precious protect him
:p cool bro
THE GREAT RESET!!!!!!!!!
I subbed before i head about the penny being donated. You rock dude, keep it going. You crack me up :)
Noo my betterys is at 1 welp its gonna die in a second now
Nice vid Ryan
Random stuff: i never had burrito or Taco I wanna die
This mann is a true legend !!👐
I subscribed a while ago. I just unsubscribed and subscribed again for a penny 😝
He has so good people skills!
When he acts weird or awkward it’s really funny and makes my day! You always make me laugh :)
7:59 that yes
are you at longbeach?
the fact we're on Day 7/30 and he has raised 226,000/100,000$ Ryan is just such a great dude, the world would be a better place if everyone was a little more like you
started watching this series when he was already on day 7 but I'm so invested, anytime he hits a goal like breaking a 100$ I felt the need to come put some hype in the chat like it's Twitch lmao
how he already have an iphone
💗💗💗
🖤🖤🖤
ryan im brian ryan
if unsubbed and subbed, would it count?
Next time get a gym membership trial for 3 days it's free and you can shower
This series in one word: *busnis*
L
I’m going to great reset at the 29th day
Life is amazing I’m going to eat this burrito- Ryan 2022
hello
He’s not selling water for $200 again is he?
4:14 marked cuz i gotta go to school
Someone gonna spend 1k for just him to say a name
Great work buddy but how do you charge your phone tho??
No offence but $2 for that small water bottle is just ridiculous 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
How can u sleep in an hammock every night with all the mosquitoes around ?
this is amazing! you are amazing!
Im gonna donate 50,000
i wish i could meet you in LA. you are the best !!! good luck.. you got this
i'm obsessed !!
7:06  i dont think people thought that was drinking
I feel like he dosent actually sleep in the hammock Seems to sketchy…
Hey man I love this series i think its amazing and very entertaining by the way can you drop the songs that you use for the series I keep hearing this one song that sounds amazing and also I think you should buy some cologne for the times when you don’t have any way of cleaning yourself so you smell good
Hey I’m in LA! Eating chipotle and drinking soda rn..
Am I the only one that wants to know where the bike went
Nice
Ive been binge watching your journey lol i love it
Why not just keep selling the 40 packs of water for 2$. cause if you sell 3 40 packs a day is atleast 240$. do that for 4-5 days thats about 1000$ then you can just get a flight 🤷🏿‍♂️
I love everything about this except returning the cooler after using it.
I’m officially a damelio
Me as a 12 year old growing more facial hair than him.
at the time to record this video you have more money than me XD
I feel as if this will Instill new values of money after going through what he is going through. Having almost nothing, but the clothes on your back and a pocket of change, then coming up from that to going across the US.
Great to see your progress everyday! Why not $1Water?
Are all Ryan this awkward which I love🥰
8:44 is my gta 5 apartment
Tommy is so genuinely kind and he always plays by the rules and dosen't go “technically I can still do this”
Dude i would of totally bought soda from ya i enjoy soda ♡ also im glad youre making it so far and meeting so many nice ppl   I love your vids
U literally met a famous rapper sadboy loko
Selling water makes more than food delivery. Interesting discovery :D
I don’t care about the meals ;) do more of this
bruh
I did my well deed and i added a penny to the bucket 😗
Does it count if I unsubscribe and subscribe again?
My guy got the tanjiro drip
What happened to the cooler
"one word, burrito time"  Ryan that's two words
Around 1:31 he starts playing gta5 in first person
7:56 O.o
The great reset
8:48
You are lit dude
I love the part where you pause your day to thank God. This will also be a daily thing I now start. Thank you 😊
Did dude just use women’s deodorant??
Iam so in love with that bike
Him selling water*  Me: ok why is this making me thirsty lol
It’s crazy, when I started watching this the night before last, your total was just over 36,000 dollars and now it’s at almost 230,000, you’re doing a great thing while providing great content. It’s great to know that content like this will be seen for many years to come to inspire others.
I love how he is such a good Christian keep up the good work with your videos!🫶💗
The fact that selling water is a better income than doordash
Lemme explain why I do want ot be in states . By trying to sell water for 2 days like at day 3 I will get around 120$ ( I have a bike and parents will give me 10$ for cooler :U ) In my country ( Moldova ) 1$ is 20 Lei . So 20 * 120 = 2400 lei . My parents make 10k Lei in 2 , so uh . I will get the amount of money they get for a month is 8 day . Sadly if I would get to this country I would die cuz im a small boy , and my IQ isnt enough high to be alive .     Fun fact - Leu is the money of the country and Leu can be traduced as lion
Y not water and soda
I was binge watching this when someone donated like $200,000 through youtube and not the actual site so, no reset?????
i like how hes not going the route of saving up for a few days and buying a plane ticket bc I'm sure he could get a cheap one for about 500 maybe a little more
you should try your money on somthing to get more money like pokemon???
6 seconds
Sell ice cream
I subbed cos I use food banks myself  ,thank you ryan
*the great reset I mean THE GREAT RESET*😂🤣😂🤣
Ryan your so inspirational man, showing people out there that you can make money even when U have nothing but a penny

Buying the soda was not a bad decision, you made money off of it, and some guy also gave you $25

Ryan: plans to dump sand from shoe also Ryan: entire desert appears from shoe
This series gave me hope that good people are everywhere.

What music is playing in the background of this absolutely amazing series?
Anyone remember LETS GO TOMMY

Makes me happy seeing all the nice people
You mean to tell me I was at Venice beach with Ryan on that exact day…NOOO WHY DIDNT I SEE HIMMM

Unsubscribe then re subscribe to bankrupt Ryan who's with me
This series has just turned into selling people food and water.
As someone who has had to move a lot and find different homes since the age of 16, this is super inspiring.
The super great reset is nice
does anybody know what that guitar song that ryan has been putting in these videos. its so catchy and i have been dying to know.
whenever u get to TN ill buy something from u.
pathetic, my little brother made 500$ in a day bc people said he was so cute and pretty much everyone overpaid for the soda we were selling. I took the money afterward and gave him a soda to compensate.
I know who joe is 😳
Memorial Day for others: holiday   Memorial Day for me:Funeral day 5/31/21
10:18 it was 9.3 seconds
"i think bikers are thirsty"  -ryan 2022
10:15  I’m pretty sure it was “3.1” seconds
u sound like nux taku ngl
This series is fun to watch
I hope he's gonna pay capital gains tax on all them water profits!!
It’s funny how Ryan did doordash for a whole day and barely earned anything, but he earned so much from selling WATER of all things.
gulp gulp gulp *drinking noises* LOL
A few mins ago the donations were 36006$ now it’s 36026 so someone donated 20$ 😀§
He is awkward and he knows it and you can see that he knows on his face and that he's being honest and that's what I love
We not gonna talk about the guy wearing a hoodie on 4:55
Idk how much are plane tickets there in America but i think if you kept selling water everyday for like 20 days u wud have been able to buy a plane ticket🤣🤣keep up the good work❤️
I SUBSCRIBED FEED THE CHILDREN
I love this series, ur so amazing ryan, so charismatic, it's gonna be a journey.
He will get tattoo for £100000
Good to know selling water is the best way to make money. At least in LA
les gooo
Only until day 3, did I realise it’s $50000 for the GREAT RESET and not $50 because I was thinking of how many people could’ve donated $50 🤦‍♂️
10:28 Thats the gta 5 spot
Did you know that people who are actually in the financial place Ryan is playing out right know are Significantly more happy about life then if they had 1 million dollars Meaning one of the biggest joys in life is financial sucsess
bro got around 80$ with 40 waters worth  5$ lol great profit tho
Can you make on donate Google Play
Grape flavored koolaid gun doesn’t taste good to me
I’m here now    Random car:hooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooonk
I love Ryan, his optimism and his “awkardness”!! he’s so charming
Ryan I’m Brian Ryan 🤣
Random guy: "Your water is too pricey, needa cut it." Ryan: Cuts the price Guy: "I still don't want it."
imagine you make it there and don have the penny on you
Ngl you looked cute with the cooler (no homo) lol

If you are wondering the song Ryan used between clips, it's called "Her Name is Edith (Instrumental Version)" by OTE. It's a really good song and gives me good vibes every time I listen to it 😊.
when you where in the store buying a cooler you should try selling juanitoss they taste like soda but a lot more healthy and in my opinion is better
What are you doing tommy
5:00 gta5 flashbacks right there
Lets go MrWhoseTheBoss and Isaiah Photo coming in with 5k
We should all just unsubscribe then just resubscribe
It's kind of sad that i only have $20 from me trying to save my money after losing $180 to having to replace all my stuff for school, but after two days Ryan already has $43. That really says a lot about my money management skills ;)
@Ryan Trahan You can go to local  Gurudwara. They will give you free food and you can stay there for unlimited days.
11:53 im a teen so I don’t have a, card but I did subscribe so I hope that counts!
Did Ryan buy the same cooler he returned on Day 1 😂
can we all agree Thant Ryan should have at least 20ml subscribers by now
hes painfully awkward but for some reason i love it
GTA V?
What about 100k
8:45 Del Perro Heights
Amazing how bro doesn’t get killed by a jet walking around that beach
I think if you spare your money you can buy a flicht
7:59
his inventory also has his sunburns
Who new selling water gave you more money than having a job
Ryan please wear sunscreen!!!!!!!!!!!
This just shows if you have enough self confidence , you can make money quite easily.
He made more money selling water than working Doordash, this says a lot.
that water disgustingly expensive tho 😨
yes
Bro this is so inspirational I really want to try doing something like this too
where do you charge your phone and camera?
i thought american more to minding their busines, well they kind of generous actually. this video shows that, at least in california? well i hope i can see more good part about america in other state
I would have just sold water for 2 more days until you could afford the $230 bus ticket to Greenville NC
8:15
Ryan's awkwardness is something else
13:06 His eyes turned red
You should sell ice cream. At Walmart they have big packs of ice cream for a few dollars.
How did he get that burrito and a drink for under seven dollars
The fact that he helping people while he’s struggling is so inspiring
Ryan, you have to sell the soda for 1.99 so you sell more
this series is soo cool, very inspiring
Why do you keep returning the cooler? Just keep it at that point
I got a microscope
A plane would be easier and cheaper lol.
Lets get everyone to DM Elon Musk .....lmao
You should find the most ungrateful town in the world idk if that exists but it is a recomendation
I’m not sure if that guy forgot to give you a $20… it’s a common scam. But glad you got it.
You got this Ryan!!
LES GO TOMMY

What song did he play during the breathing session
U look like cole labrant-
Imagine having somebody walk into your store, buy a cooler, return it, buy it again a few days later and return it again 😂
10:40 oh hell nah
hi
He’s so nice, you can tell he’s touched by all the other nice people. It’s great to see so many decent human beings.
Waters?
money is so fascinating and complex
You are so brave!!✌❤
I love that Spider-Man 3 reference on 5:03
when your selling your water, you should stop to ask. It will make it more of an option physiologically.
Like unsubscribe, and then subscribe again 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
dis a big banger btw whens the collab with ARGYT
Bro your my impression I want to grow up to be like you.(your the best)😃😃
I liked this series so much that I started the same challenge with my friend with little transport/tech deck
2:41 Ryan be vibin

T - Thank Y - Y'all S - So M- Much
LETS GO TOMMY!!! (Hey ryan I’m bryan and Hi ryan)
Lmao he bout 40 water but don't drink 1 bottle
Just got your self respect from me young one and I'll subscribe to, you just put a smile on my face, and believe me that is extremely hard to do, 7.7million subscribers keep it up young one, and thanks for making me laugh.
all i learn from these is that apparently americans keep heaps of cash on them
My idea is the water sold better than the soda because soda isn't as good for people who are exercising, running, skate boarding, surfing, volleyballing, etc because the soda expands in the stomach and hurts. I've made that mistake before, and I threw up cause of it.
Buy a used mini bike to travel!
How do you film/edit your videos if your on the road?
Him: I’m gonna eat this in 2.1 seconds Also him: doesn’t eat it in 2.1 seconds even with Timelapse
I saw a clip online of kids getting ran up on because they were selling water on gang territory. Be careful
This series has me so nostalgic for America and the days I used to cross country! :'( Keep up the good work brother!
I cant shake off the feeling that some of the people who donate more money than they need to just are doing it because they see a camera...
7:11 girl tho
“Sand is traitorous” Anakin, is that you?
Lol mrbeast be like here’s 10 great resets
I can’t donate sadly but I will subscribe. I support Ryan and Provide one penny worth of donations? 😁😁
Do you miss Haley?
i liked the new animation that yt added when  u like a video so i wanted to see what the dislike button would do so and then just switch it back to the like button but then it said “shared with creator” AFTER I DISLIKED IT so ryan if u notice a dislike coming from my account i changed it back, just thought u should know.
Ryan's awkwardness is probably one of his best personality traits. Change My Mind
YOU GOT THIS MAN PT3
There is no way this dude is actually doing this. He's staying in a motel filming when it's convenient come on people.
no sé cómo llegué a tu canal pero que cool, ya me suscribí para lo de la donación jaja
I still cant believe how much the hotels are! Here in the midwest u can stay at a motel for $50.. crazy
O have a lot of pennies
You could make more money doing this instead of and actual job lol. Im moving.
He got so much from selling water I'ma do thatlol
Watching his videos high is amazing
seeing his sunburn turn into a tan is the funniest thing
ryan bryan ryan
ey you. Yes, you. You're probably scrolling through the comments, like I am, reading all these motivational comments. If you are reading this at night, you should get some sleep, and don't stress about everything going on in the world, or what you are going through. Don't dwell on things from the past, don't stress on your future. Just live your life, because you only get one. Do whatever makes you happy, not what other people want from you. For me, I'm gonna wake up tomorrow morning, get hit the gym, and cherish life for the amazing blessing that it is. I hope you do the same and have an amazing day as well!
Ayo that "The Great Reset" pose was 🔥
happy pride thing
If you don’t come to Colorado to where I am I will reset you
Not even kidding when I breathe in I started to choke
Series: Ryan scams people
mans a complete W
5:26 Demon Slayer shirt. Nice
keep on going mate
“OnE miLiOn DoLlArS dOnAtEd FoR sPoTiFy PrEmIuM”   Spotify allowed me to get premium after 2 years, no cards would work so Spotify premium is probably worth around *696,969,696 DOLLARS* now
looks like selling water is a very effect game plan, I really hope you make it across America, this is gonna be an awesome journey
What if you save up enough to buy a single cheap plane ticket at once
I love the music at 1:33 for no reason
The guy at 7:35 was from gta 5 funny moments video Ryan im bryan ryan
if you buy 40 waters for 5$, each water is less than 13 cents!! 2$/water is a huuuuge profit!
I hope "THE GREAT RESET" never comes
Pop not soda
I'm just in the middle of taking my deep breathes when Ryan just starts to ZOOM on his bike.
Hehe 2:03
What microphone do you use?
He filmed that on my birthday
The term is Angelenos.
Your not Supposed to say have a good mermorial day
😂 this is why my walmart wont take my too small for me dress. Lol. *returns cooler... TWICE"
this is a good hustle ngl 40 waters for 2 bucks u can easily make 80 bucks a day and if u run out and buy more than its 80 waters and that’s 160 dollars a day that’s crazy
The Great Reset!!!!
8:44 if ur a true gamer u will know
was that the Ireland Boys at 5:13
thats so crazy... when starting to watch the series the money was at 30,000, and its now at 32,000
each water is 16 cents; Ryan sells for $2
Bro is literally, legally playing gta
Commenting on every episode to I get pinned.
10:40 tony is a very good man

The great reset. I just checked, You reached 50,000 :)
I was already subscribed so I just unsubscribed then subscribed again
Next time say "Tu quiero agua?"
take a shot every time ryan says cheers
What’s the chipotle order??
I feel like if people are buying the water for two dollars who cares if it should be lower
he should have went to the casino and done the wheel spin.
Happy Memorial Day pollos
Aye mr whostheboss
Your price is way to high you need to cut itttttt😂☝🏾
Just love his positive energy! Very entertaining and funny, new Subscriber here! Keep up the great work and amazing video

It's inspiring how happy he is to experience life
Rayen: life is great am gonna it this Borito, tonight is the night we're gonna buy a bus ticket appert from that am going to eat this borito

You said you would eat that in 2-1s but you ate it in like four seconds
At 4:59 I realized that the building in the background is in gta V
STOP USING BONEWORKS MUSIC IT’S TOO GOOD AND I LOVE YOU FOR IT 😡
RYAN BRYAN RYAN
“Sand is treacherous, dude” Anakin skywalker: he has the right idea
Yeah
The fact that Ryan says "cheers" EVERY sales is  awesome
It’s true, he is my favorite content creator!
Idk why sometimes Ryan sounds depressed or sad
stop making these videos hard to watch
it just hit me that this series is going to probabaly be 30+ episodes
Great video !
I unsubbed and resubbed hoping it would count as 1 penny 🤣🤣🤣
I recently started to watch your vids about this and you’re amazing! Your so strong and lucky that you’ve hit 100 dollars from 3 days! Keep it up bro.
I just don’t understand why you have to be so religious all the time.
My mans is in the gta beach

我很累，黄砖路是橙色的，日落是绿色的，我的视力模糊了，我饿了！ 对于那些翻译我需要意见的人，我感到非常抱歉！  @

You could make more money by doing what u do than jobs
You could make more money by doing what u do than jobs
noice
There’s so many key lessons for this series, some I have thought of so far:  1. You need to have money to make money (yes he started at 1 penny, but he had to get more money and spend it to upgrade and make more)  2. Budget, keep track of your expenses and income so you can manage it effectively and know your progress 3. Have ideas, be creative. Have a plan to keep growing 4. Have a goal, crystal clear goal, something that motivates you  5. Take action. Ideas and goals are worth nothing without the action to implement it 6. Mindset: believing in yourself and knowing anything is possible (most people lack this and don’t even start) 7. persistence, don’t give up and keep reaching for what you want
Who remembers that one guy that said "200$ FOR A WATER, THATS WAY OVER PRICED BROTHER!"
when he dumped the ice it sounded like ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Black doge 552
Oh come to my grandma’s 🏡🏘🏠
Title idea:sell water at 110°C

Memorial Day is my birthday

Nah bro that burrito took 5 seconds I counted.

Bro really spent and got back all 40 something $ in the first few minutes that's crazy bro
So you wanna person screaming Los Angeles At my doorstep OMG I saw you on the window Why didn't you record the part where you stopped at my door And left and note🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
This man is putting in signs.  He knows what kind of reset We have put in motion. And the People have no clue at all.
Ryan you are so sweet and you make me laugh everyday you are generous and I am so thankful for you 🥰
I got the kool aid him and it was horrible
I just subed
It's funny how he puts in more clips of getting refused for sales than him actually selling them
I love how after every water sale he said CHEERS
Tony is going to help you a lot through your tough times during these 30 days, everyone always needs a time to take some deep breaths.
why i can't visit the site in the discription if I'm from Russia? that's sad. Very cool idea tho of foundraising! Whatching this vids making days brighter :^)
(0-0)
Ain’t no way LA is that good. 9:33 his burrito is PACKED with stuff and he only paid $7 for it, here in Michigan I pay $10 for one half that size
In the lands of Sweden, water bottles can be about 30 kr(or about $3.3)
Selling water better than door dash
water overpriceeeeeeed
You mean 5.1
I wonder if he'll go through albuquerque😂
2:41 how I feel when I watch these videos
Gasp for air
Fat hghuhh
This guy is so funny i love it
Lol
I was eating chipotle while Ryan got some chipotle
Ryan: dumps sand out of shoe me: checks for sand in my shoes :)
I think doing the math there is a 4 day delay on the days/video
You could get two knife skins in Valorant for that kind of money!
You make the best videos
How do you edit ur vids? If your not at your house
Watch someone donate 50,000 as soon as hes about to make it
apple
4:17 Is it just me or do those two women look like the female swimmers in pokemon sun and moon?
Sell lemonade
I knew he should’ve kept the original sign
Lol so much work to give up a penny
I wonder how he finds a place to sleep at night with a hammock with out getting hassled.
His awkwardness always warms my heart frs, but the entire reason I whatch Ryan is because he is never afraid to be awkward or cringe on camera
Hi
Holy sh1t my battery is at 1
Buy Arizona I mad 500$ off it selling 1 for 3$
“People In LA doesn’t drink soda” GTA 5 aka rockstar games: Then what is the point on making working soda wending machine?
Dad: If you think $100 isn’t much, go and make it. Then I’ll get you that phone. Ryan:
Love what ur doing bro👌👍🏿
well another penny just got donated!
NestleAny%
Keep it up
He must get recognized like crazy in public
Ryan is da best
If yuo play it in 2x  speed he did eat in 2.1 seconds
I’m b-b-b-b-broke but for some reason all these years I haven’t subbed sooo I just donated a penny 🙌🏽
He’s investing into MrBeasts chocolate bars
Bro I think you have to brush your teeth some time
this series is fire!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
so... what if he gets to jimmy and loses the penny
Do not call me a sleepy head
That was a thick burrito
there are 2 types of hungry people: 1_People that don't hesitate eating without pronouncing a single word 2_People that takes the first bite telling that it's soooo good and then comments on it for about 2 or 3 mins
Free 1 penny just started watching you and you the best your so funny and always determined I just subbed keep up the good work!😁
i just noticed, and the end of the video it said isaiah photo sent 5000 dollars. 🤯
good job on the last 2 days
The fact that he does these challenges just shows his appreciation for his viewers! THANK YOU SO MUCH RYAN!!
Let's go Tommy
He keeps doing his match wrong in every video.. If $0.01 is donated then the meal count would be 10k not 100k
MrWhosetheBoss donated 5 grand wow
ryan: being in LA made me realize 2 things. No one here drinks soda, but life is good :)  me: those 2 things dont meet at all.
Soon everyone’s gonna have Ryan’s water!
"Los Angelins" "Wait I just want to call everyone a Damelio." 😂
this just shows that you can litterally make loads of money just by having 1p
9:17 THE MEME, THE MAN, THE LEGEND
This guy excudes such a positive energy that they tends to lifts everyone spirits😍😍
SPOILERS:       damn my man rlly got drink n dashed
pro tip: dont do door-dashing just sell water you will get more
Taht cool
8:44 i know i play too much at gta 5
very epic
SO even if you soll that wather for one dollar you stil made profit b ecouse you bought 40 but if you do the simple math that 40/5=0.8 then one dolar whic is 100 pennys sold for 80 is 20 pennys profit
im loving this!
Me: counting when you said I am going to eat this in 2.1 seconds and it was 5
Ryan Bryan Ryan
series are goat bro caant wait to watch em all
Angelenos LOVE water.
I have a question where does the camera man sleep, also what did you bring in your backpack?(from home)
In my country a “secluded alley” is where they rob you while you’re counting money! 🤣
This man has a great vibe about life, something i can only dream of having which, some day might come true.  Take 3 deep breaths and thank god everyday - Ryan Trahan. Good luck.
Your videos make my day, keep going, you're amazing
I love this, it's a great cause and he acts so human. i had to subscribe
I have acces denied what ? (On your web)
Tommy the goat
crazy how he bought a $5 pack of 40 waters and ended up making $100
4:58 Why are we not talking about how the song is literally twinkle twinkle little star/abc???
Dude got 100 dolars in 3 days I get that in 5 weeks... Ye Im coming to america to sell stuff
Ommmm where was the cooler he bought from day 1?😂
How does he get that money so easily
Ryan could be poor and living the life
Im happy for him but i feel like hes going to get skin cancer from all that sun hes exposed to
Man i love this guy i watched him when i was 7 years old
Nice
hi
Watching this in a car which is in a  parking of a shop on my moms macbook and am having fun in the sun

What if these was THE GREAT RESET
Ryan: *OH AMAZING is it 50 cents* Me dying of laugh 🤣😂😂🤣
kepp up the amazing job Ryan!
this series is FANTASTIC! One of the best things that came out of YT this year!
GTA players be like 😳
who thinks that at some point he might run into a karen on his journeys who say he should not be selling water?
Why didn’t you go back and get more waters to sell?
I don’t think you need to cut it. They just want to take advantage.
bro now buy a wallet
Ryan is filming a video right now about day 4
How is the bike song namend
Uk version of this challenge I would love to see it
How is the Song named Bye the bike
LET'S GO TOMMY
Still waiting for the great reset

hello
Oi
11:41 "*THE GREAT RESET* SMH" lmao
This challenge would of been 4 days if he bought a plane ticket
Nag lalako si lodi.. hope they understand :)
My country 1 Bottle Of Water is 0.25$
Mrwhosetheboss and Isaiah photo donated, those are two of my favorite youtubers, besides Ryan of course
It's IMPOSSIBLE for me to watch this series without smiling. :) Thank you!
buy a wallet with your money
man went from $2 to $1.50 to $1 to $5
Your vid’s are very good so don’t say things like that was stupid ok because if you think it was cool you can think that
On the 3rd day, you can do it!
Bro where I live, 40 bottles are 4 bucks
"They used to ride these babies for miles!!!" nice ref there good sir!! 🍕
Oh yeah (making water sounds)🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣THAT WAS SO FUNNY
Ain’t u tired?
stan the water man irl
guys, has he finished it now? or is he doing it as we speak. seems a little pre-recorded
wait how are you doing this in blazers
where do u piss?
One thing i really like about Ryan is that if someone says something like,”Your product is way too expensive”, Ryan doesn’t respond as,”ARE YOU BEING RUDE TO ME?!?”, like a Karen. But anyway, LETS GO TOMMY
13:28 Let’s go Isaiah Photo & MrWhoseTheBoss & Jimmy Hendrix
he bought a bus ticket but still no sunscreen 😭
infinite money glitch?
I'm really tempted t dontate 50000
Ur seriously telling me can spend 7 bucks and make 93 wot
give me magu in gpo
Jesus loves you alot trust in His death 4 salvation and be saved from eternal hell <3 Jesus died on the cross for you bro.
he is  so  funny
Those deep breathes and thanking God felt really good bro needed that💯🙏🏼
These videos are really good. But returning the cooler is kinda dishonest. Especially more than once. They lose good money from that decision.
The Great reset
i doubt he spends much of his earned money on food... man shows footage of eating once a day and 0 drinking either he dead or thats cap and hes faking or not following all rules
We love your awkwardness Ryan. Your personality is so much fun and your videos are so light hearted and positive. Thank you ♥️
uwu
Everyone but Ryan: the great reset   Ryan: ₮ⱧɆ ₲ⱤɆ₳₮ ⱤɆ₴Ɇ₮
If the 40 water bottles are $4.99/$5 each water bottle is $0.13 per bottle which makes $2 super overpriced
We are nearly half way!!
Most wholesome YouTuber on the platform
The Great Reset! (Dramatic music plays)
9:34 los angels that's what I call 'em
Bullsh*t you traveled that far and survived for 30 days on a f**king Penny! You couldn't even survive one day in today's age on $5.00!
Isaiah photo donated 5k?

Ryan is so cute OML
it's like im watching a tv show, absolutely love this content
“Ryan I’m Bryan Ryan”
Why do I wanna do this so badly just to make 100 bucks for somthing I need lol
2000 mules videos watch it share everywhere please thanks Jesus amen justice for children!!!!
Your contain is so interesting and u humble respect
This is a perfect example of how much more we appreciate the things we REALLY have to work to get, and it just does not always happen.
12:27
Watching this makes me feel so good. You make life seem easy. Very easy. I thank god for everything, God is good. Remember that.
U just got an free subscribe
Did anyone notice Luke Davidson in the background?
it feels like cheating when you didn't use the cash in your pocket to buy the bus ticket
Thay are called gringos
Was anyone else surprised by how cheap Chipotle was in California?
Bro I’m 11 and have more facial hair then you
3:00 how'd he go from 76 to 67? In the cents category.
By far my favorite series! Keep it up Ryan! 👍

I have an idea for him why not he does a street food bussiness or job
Why is this so entertaining
Ryan deserves 10 million Subs. Very unique and awesome contents all the time.
i want to know where he sleeps.
RYAN you should invest in a few buckets and then play the buckets for people and have a jar out for money :)
I love how Ryan said “I tried to get some attention but I got a rash instead”
Imagine living in a country that makes you pay 28 dollars for a single bus ticket
love the vids
Yeo bro buy a hat
No matter how many good works you do you'll never be saved by them. So, Repent and believe in the gospel of Jesus Christ.   For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: not of works, lest any man should boast.   - Ephesians 2:8‭-‬9 KJV
Epic
Prank idea: Tell people you have a cooler car, and pull up in a car that looks like a cooler
look like ryan was about to get hit w that car at 8:30
Where's Hailey
How the hell do you have energy to do this every day?! You are literally a saint and so committed to this process! Beautiful to witness!
I love how he buys a cooler, then returns it :l
Hii
Dude how come when he does this things there’s always a really nice person that gives him like $20
Ryan: Tattoo whatever you want  Me: Okay mom its time to beg >:)
People just buy stuff from anyone anymore! 😂
Ryan I know you won't read this but go to Walmart in the cookie isle and buy vanilla sugar wafers, they have 800 Calories and are only $1
this is the most entertaining series ever. Better than all tv shows and movies combined.
Wait @MrWhoseTheBoss donated $5,000 dollars 💸
RYAN I BEG OF YOU, B U Y  S U N S C R E E N

For people who isn't in the USA, how can you return an item such as a "cooler" that has been clearly used and you get your money back?
Let’s go tommy

Man i was having a really rough day:there was this arabic competition in my school and whichever grade won will go to a pretty noice mountain looking from the pictures it looked like a luxurious one.but things got into a really big turn we won but the day we were gonna go i overslept. Damn i was really looking forward to this then i saw this vid and it cheered me 5/95% thank you Ryanand that Tony guy.

Cute video. Nice that you actually worked for your money.  I do have an issue with you return the cooler.  The store won't be able resell that cooler as new.
How does he charge his phone and camera?
Bro he should get some water flavoring when he sells water and charge and extra $.50-$1 to have it flavored
I would spawn a helicopter on the beach.Yup that's what I would do !
return the cooler after putting huge amount of wear on the wheels. Id do the same exact thing tho. I was wondering why he bought a 2nd cooler but now I know what happened to the first one.
How to find nice people 101
“Ryan, I’m Bryan, Ryan.”
I love how he keeps joking around no matter how little people laugh it is so inspiring
Throw a Coke Zero in there and I’ll buy all of them
I subscribed :))
I donated :)
ryan next time go to chipotle and order a bowl with everything you would order on a borrito and just ask for a extra tortilla and make a borrito with half the bowl and save the rest for later that way you safe money on food
I can't believe this series started with a single penny
Pray to Chandler. Now
Ben
This is like watching a 30 episode daily show
Dis guy really want me to take out mah saving to start some business 😩😩n make it a series but I barely speak English 😂😂😂
sop bAD
I want to do what you did one day
I SHOULD HAVE GONE TO VENICE INSTEAD OF THE PEIR THIS DAY- NOOOO
hey ryan what if you added like some flavorings in the water, for example koolaid or energy drink spray thingies
3:31 why man
Ryan I’m Bryan Ryan
Lol is that girl deo?  That's adorable. Everything about this kid is so cute and goofy and naturally quirky.
what happens to preston when ur on ur bike magic?...
is...is he going to make 30 of these?
“wHo HAs A miCRoScOpE”
Didnt he sell the bike last time?
U have a lot of energy, i would definitely act a little more chill or tired to not be awkward
For some reason i always get firsty when Ryan is selling water.
the h20mg joke was atually funny
Tempted to try this so I can pay my tuition lol
Just realised this is gonna end on my birthday…
His main vocabulary is howdy and cheers
5:26 we Stan tanjiro kid
i feel like the music at 8:28 will become iconic throughout this series
“We’re gonna be donating $0.1 for every subscriber this month” Me: **unsubs and resubs** “my goals are beyond your understanding”
11:12 The great reset!
He’s so CRINGE AND I LOVE IT
that kool aid gum sucks
Amazing vid👍👍👍
Please keep daily uploading it works for your style so much
Seems like @MrWhoseTheBoss donated $5.000. he's one of my fav ytbers, so big W to him!
This man sends out the best vibes I love his attitude abt everything😭
I added a penny
Man Los Angeles must be super hot right now that it's summer! Please get sunscreen Ryan!
Idk why but my brain thought that the 0.01$ was 0.01$ of a penny idk 😂 I’m dumb?
the way he could earn a grand if kept selling water on that beach
3:46 WAS THAT DUSTIN FROM STRANGER THINGS?!?!
Jesus loves you he died on the cross for your sins. Believe in him and you will be saved and go to heaven!
What shoes does Ryan have they look cool :D
Someone count how many times he said cheers
my guy going to Vegas bro
at 8:55 he at the gta apartment
:0
yikes this is so cringe... f7uk i hate youtube
I can’t believe he made more money selling water than doordash Lmaoooo. The beauty of sole proprietorship
The sign should say “help make my cooler lighter” lmao people love a challenge
Wouldn't it be easier to just buy a plane ticket instead with the money
how did he change his cloths
Do not eat koolaid gum it breaks apart in your mouth
I unsubscribed the subbed again so we had some donated
Ryan can sell me my own soul
This is all thanks to TOMMY!
U should put water, beer, and soda!!
Get to Minnesota
Its like he's cheating life cause he just turned 5$ into 80$ in a couple of hours
$106 dollars in three days. That’s about 33 dollers a day. He started out with a penny and now his daily  earnings end up 33 dollers a day. Not counting the money he spent on the bike and food. He is the god of entrepreneurs.
Why can’t you take the bike? Don’t the busses have a rack on the front for bikes?
Hello Ryan. This is the first time I watched your video. You came across as a bright and energetic person to me. I had a similar personality but that was 22 years back. I am 42 now. During my time there were no smartphones and youtube was not yet born. Also did not have access to video cameras. So no documented memories 😟 But looking at your energy levels and little funny outlook I could not stop myself going back 22 years, in my mind. Keep helping us rediscover ourselves. Love from India 🇮🇳 ♥️
Where the hell does he sleep?
did he shower at the infamous smapoo shower pranks spot???????
i died when ryan.called venice “ven is
I think selling beer would be good
Ryans going to have a beard by the end of this
Noooooooooo the bike
Min 5:30 some loco Vatos npc‘s spawned at Del Pero

You payed $7 for a burrito
And I realize your brave to be doing this maybe I will try 1day :)
I wish I can give you $1aa dollars
bro instead of spending money on water to sell, spend ur money on weed and v pens, think bout it. You'll make lik 12k in an hour, you'll be able to fly across america in a private jet.  And this is cali, marijuana is, legal so u know people gonna be buyin that stuff left and right, I'm just stop buy the hood, everyone buyin there
I love how you are trying to buy meals for america, i hope my sub will help❤️❤️
I am so emo right now HAHAHA
This shows what people can do if they put their mind to it
Ryan is prob doing day 5 as I’m watching day 3
I wish I could help you cause all that I am doing rn is like nothing so yeah
So far I learned sell water if you need dollars.
how did you get 27.36$ for returning the cooler when you paid 24.99$? is it sales tax ? America is weird with not including taxes directly on there.
You are a really good youtuber and a person. We need more people like you
donate pls
Ryan: Returns cooler Also Ryan: Buys the same cooler again
Or more I don’t know
I just realized I live close to there like 25miles
Is this a sign to drop out and start selling water?? probably
Yay
Bless everyone that buys water
These videos make me so happy just for the fact that it makes me remeber that sometime humanity is still so sweet :) Good Job Ryan!
emo = joy smart guy
When he said howdy it made me think…. Howdy is a mix of howdoyoudo without the do
This is a great Series
Loved the fact that he gave away some of his money for free and received too 💖
Please buy some sunscreen to protect your skin 🙃
Yep this one was five seconds
Keep up the grind Ryan! Love this series!
I love this series all ready :) LETS GO WHOEVER PAYED OVERPRICE (let's go tommy day 1)
Can’t he just buy a plane ticket
The great reset should be, start over to a penny, clear your inventory, and start back at the last city you were at
what iphone case is that 12:09
LET'S GO TOMMY!!
MENACE
Tony my man
Cristiano Ronaldo would be so happy that soda didn't work but water did
Love this series so much!! <3 but how tf is a bus ticket $30! In New Zealand, it's $2!
10:39 "a stranger named Tony once told me to take 3 deep breaths and thank God every day, it always calms me down and makes me feel grateful to breathe"
Next buy guaranteed to be a skateboard bro loves the skate park
That’s business
6:55
1 word “burrito time” 🤔😆 sunburn might be getting to him.
Is thar qin 655
TERRIFIC 💯 💯 💯 💯
The bike?
There should be a video game about selling water and them the cooler goes missing and you have to find it
That looks if gun is so bad
I think they think he is poor
God bless the guy who said god bless you and who gave him 20$
Why not feeding other poor countries
I donated $1
where do you shit
I love how he still buys something for himself that he doesn’t need just to kinda entertain himself!
Ryan my man god has blessed you so much I thank him for you and you have such a good heart to do this fundraiser and keep striving god bless
Help I'm inspired
i can t wait to to see episode 30
I'm surprised he hasn't eaten a McChicken yet
Returning that cooler funny af after dragging it everywhere haha
hfhfg
The people that were like “too high of price” I hate bc he was pulling it through the sand and struggling.
He just made 100$ in a few hours just selling water 🤨🔥
No electric bills to pay.
Matter of fact, I'm drinking water right now xD
This is crazy!!!
Hey you should get a souvenir from every place you visit!
Spam click subcribe button, bois
you should have gotten napkins so it wasn’t cold on the hands
actually ate the burrito in 5 seconds. Thats right, I counted.
dude we all gta players live in that black apartment :DDD 8:44
what is the song in the backgroud tho ?
I hope we get to see bearded Ryan at the end of the series
everytime i click a video i dont expect it to be bad but omfg, its pushing me closer to the edge
🇺🇸🇺🇸🚀🚀🪖🪖🐐🐐🦍🦍🦍🦍🐐🐐🪖🪖🚀🇺🇸
Make the waters $1.99 you'll sell much more than priced at $2.00
Seeing people just being good people, really just makes me happy inside.
I just love these videos...
I feel like if YouTube goes down, Ryan’s gonna be making a water company…
We love the song played at 0:50 currently, but I can assure you that by Day 30 we will all hate hearing it with a passion
Skip the Tutorial made a 10,000 donation too! They are all so amazing! ☺
TO UNDERATED
Just wondering if he needs to pay tax for these profits
Did he really return the cooler after using it and dragging it all over the beach? I'm a little bothered by that!
I can’t tell if that’s sweat or water
Did he just shower without shampoo
The guy who negotiated down and then gave him the change made me so happy 😊
you're right about one thing Ryan: life is amazing. thank you for this series that shows that
Yes of course "yes" 😆😆 00:22
Gas praists these days 5:42
wait a miniute this will go for the full pride month
10:24 i was in that exact same spot one time
I watch these videos and wonder
number 4 on trending! Wow
?what if i spam the subscribe button
Thanks for the pfp Ryan
Love ur vids
L
If you ever think your water is overpriced, just remember by local six flags once sold water bottle for 7$
I don’t think the great reset will be fun
This is insane
Hasło
Ryan: Ok taste test. mmm. much good so wow
BORIITOOOOO
he's in gta
RYAN YOU NEED SUNSCREEN
cant wait for day 4
Geve me some water
It sucks that people would never be able to actually do what he does in these videos. The only reason he’s able to sell tons of waters and all that is cause they see the camera and assume it’s for YouTube.
People where being quite rude
The fact that he can do this just proves how lazy other people are
Everyone today I pray that you overcome your lusts, your sins that you are committing that you are chained to I pray that God release you from them cut the chains off Amen.
buy sunscreen
This series is non-stop entertain
🔥🔥🔥
Wow
Nice :)
Hey :)
Lol everyday he buys the cooler uses it in the sand and returns it I mean what 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
LETS GO TOMMY
Remember, the Democrats want to arm all Ukrainians and make you pay for it with your taxes while they disarm law-abiding American citizens.  Also, Biden gave the Taliban in Afghanistan 20,000 American M4s for free after his disastrous withdrawal that got 30 Marines killed, but he wants to confiscate weapons from law-abiding Americans that they paid for with their hard-earned money.  Also, Fidel Castro Jr. (aka Justin Trudeau) just banned hand-guns in Canada, over a crime that DIDN'T EVEN HAPPEN IN CANADA, so you know that they're lying when they say that they only want to ban "military-style rifles."  Also, Democrats constantly scream that the police are "rayciss" and they're hunting black people, but yet they want to disarm all black people so only the police have guns.  OUR GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN HIJACKED BY RUSSIA....dixi
Democrats: "The police are "rayciss" and they're hunting black people!" Also Democrats: "We should take away black people's guns so only the "rayciss" police have guns!" WHAT THE FUUUUUUUUUUCK????????  In Canada, Fidel Castro Jr. just banned all hand-guns over a crime THAT DIDN'T EVEN HAPPEN IN CANADA, so you know that they're lying when they say that they only want to ban "military style rifles."  They want to ban ALL GUNS....duxu
Congratulations on making it on the trending page! You're skyrocketing into succuss on this platform. And it's well deserved. Keep being the legend!
YOU took 5.5 sec to eat the bourito
Ryan u need sunscreen. I cringe at his sunscreen
Ryan isn't socially awkward he's awkwardly social.

Your gonna get 10 million subscribers by the end of the 30 days
kids who still live with their parents problems...

7:51 I aM sO EmO nOw

The ending song is sea lion by ote
Donate to Ryan so he can have a massive tax break. Good idea.

Who are these people just paying $20 and $25 for a bottle of water... must be nice lol
ITS UNITED STATES NOT FUCKING ANERICA FRIKK’N AMERICAN!!!!?
7:34 my favorite part of this video
The way he shakes his head to the taste test with koolaid gum could be part of a new dance
By just one penny you can make a living 🥳
Wait, how des he edit his vids?   Edit: nvm I guess he does it on his phone
I was so scared someone would cut his lock and steal his bike leaving it there all day
We have all learnt a lesson today, water is overpowered.
This is amazing, just boosting the algorith
30th May When ryan recorded this
his first video is about water
When he buys the cooler  Look at the money 😎
Here everyday
Man hes so kind
"RYAN AM BRYAN RYAN" got me trippin' lol
It’s crazy how he’s playing this whole month as a random guy only making money selling things on the street but somehow bro is making more money than people with legit jobs 💀
This whole 30 days will look awesome when it is done
I feel like this series is going to go viral.
I want to see a few creators screwing over Ryan. And donating 50k every time he has a large sum of money
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."     -John 3:16 God gave us his only son Jesus Christ who Lived a sinless Life then died on the cross to endure our punishment, he rose again on the 3rd day and is currently seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty.   We have all sinned against the Perfect and Holy God that gave us Life, we all deserve the Punishment of Hell for our sin/rebellion against him.  We have all Broken the Moral Law in our Hearts, even if you don't believe in Jesus, or have never heard of him or the Law of Moses or the Bible, you are still sinful and on your way to Hell. But the GOOD News is that Jesus Christ took our sin upon himself by being Crucified and shed his Blood as payment for our Sins.   He took our Punishment and gave us his reward of Eternal Life in Heaven  Jesus is returning to Judge the world soon my Friends Please Repent and believe in his sacrifice and Love for you, believe in him as your Lord and Saviour, and you shall be saved.   May God Bless you all.
Not only does he sells water, he also bested Matt Stonie on eating burritto. Now that's content. Good content that is.

Your totally awesome and your cringe and awkward in such a relatable way! Keep it up curly top ☺️
i love your vids
LETS GO THOMAS!
Sell the bike before you go on a bus.
aye now i’m worth 00.1 cent
Lets gooo Tommy!
first comment for the 1 day mark
Love your videos
Nonono it’s fine you’re entertaining
you should buy some gold ( if it would be safe from the THE GREAT RESET )
When Ryan gets older and we age with him its gonna feel crazy when this series ages and we look back at how young and different he may be. I thought of this when he mentioned he can grow facial hair. I'm leaving this here as a memory for myself and others. The only way is forward.
you should get a gym membership so you can shower across the whole country
This is a great series to follow and come back to later! So happy you're doing this for others.
I dont know why but pike his vidoes just feel so peaceful wholsome and i have a really good time while watching his video
You should say on your sign that it’s ice cold soda or water. Because some people don’t think there always cold even though you have a cooler.
how do ppl think 2.00 is 200 like are they dumb or dont see the .
been doing this for 30 years
I feel like being a million subscriber youtuber just gives you charisma and luck
Mrwhosetheboss coming in with the 5 grand
what happened to his other cooler
6:54 QUINN??? IS THAT LORD QUINN??????
1:15  THEY DID THE  G R I D D Y
ah 1 month of video :D epic
Also I can’t believe he is allowed to ride around without a helmet on as a Aussie I would of got a fine by now 😂
Who's waiting for day 4?
The thumbnail tho 😳
It must be so awkward returning the cooler 2 times
Ryan: “I’m so awkward” Me: relatable
My birthday was on memorial day
I thouught i saw cbum
liar
I know you probably won't see this but I think that if you went to a large market place you could probably flip items there
If you wiggle the bottom of your ear you feel happy
This series, seriously motivating me a lot.
1 word burrito time -this dumb guy
1 more penny:)
I’m 11 and I have stash
Can anyone else see the similarity of day 2 thumbnail on this series and day 2 of the 1 week version
If he keeps going like this he’s going to be a millionaire?
We can do it
Sometimes i forget that you know haley pham🥲
Man it was 3 seconds I calculated it 😭
This guy can thrive in any social ecosystem it’s amazing
These videos taught we the concept of money
#3 on trending💪
I just wandered: if you are so far from home how do you charge your camera?
I’m assuming got that in one hour more of this comment coming out, Ryan will upload the 4th day
He said he though he could crack 100 dollars but do the math 40X2 is 80 so he could only make 40 dollars profit
I cant wait for the whole series to be out BUT I HAVE TO WAITTTTTT
I just hope his skin doesn't hurt! D:
whens day 4 coming!!
You better pay your editor well ;)  I'm amazed at what paste he has to edit and upload these videos!  But respect to you and your team for doing this challenge!

Awesome content, lately the Btc/stock and housing market has caused a lot of confusion among investors, is this the right time to invest or to hodl due to recurrence about bullish or bearish trend. I need guidance?
Ryan is just such a nice and honest guy, he really restores my faith in the world

Hey Ryan I'm a small YouTuber who streams escapists and I only have 3 subscribers but I want to ask if I could become a editor for you
Let's go tommy
8:20 I still think returning the cooler after getting your use out of it is scamish and a bit scummy.
In 2012, I almost died from a drug overdose but Jesus Christ saved my life.  During this near death experience, I cried out to the Lord Jesus in prayer and repented to Him for my sins and He saved my life.  Please repent to the Lord Jesus for your sins and then get fully submerged under water as a baptism to God in the name of Jesus and obey what He wants you to do with your life or if you don't do this then when you die you will go to hell.
hi ryan this vido is good you ar such a good boy and it is amasing on 7.54m subscribers I subscribe

You look like a surfer
Ryan quick tip in LA: Make sure you go to lemonade it’s a good place for you 😀

Man selling water seems profitable. Thanks for teaching the life hack Ryan.
I feel like he keeps telling everyone that he's on a mission. Making them give him money
7:29 "that's cheap for water"  People in India : excuse me what! That's expensive 🥲
I kinda want someone to donate $49 999 just to freak him out or smthg

Gt
Lovely video Ryan
NOTE TO EDITOR: Please tell Ryan to get some sunscreen! Please! My boy looks like a lobster and I'm starting to fear for his life! It will only take a few dollars, and he will feel AWFUL in the month to come if he doesn't. The challenge will become REALLY unpleasant! Thx! P.S. Great job editing! 👍 I'm sure Ryan really appreciates you doing that for him! (And so do we!)
hi

Your arm must’ve been tired from carrying that esky around all day
wtf bus ticket costs 50 cents in greece
Good luck ryan!!!!!
Where did you store the bike cause in LA so many thieves exist trying to steal your stuff lol
I have never been inspired by someone selling water bottles until today.
This is so fun to watch bro
There were other youtubers
Just unsubscribed and resubscribed to help the cause
I'm happy rn, thanks for ur existence, literally saving and making my day
This man has something called resilience
You’re the best
You are the best 😘😘😘 Howdy !!
Can spend $7 on a burrito but is tacky enough to return a cooler that he used.  SMH
Well done for selling so much water!
can't wait for THE GREAT RESET

Shsh
Love ya man 😘✌🥳🤩😅😆😆😀😃😄😁😗😋😚😍😇😊😌😎🥳😗😉🥰
I just realized I wasn't subscribed.
"Ryan,i am Bryan ryan" is the part that made me laugh
If 69 upside down is 69, then 96 upside down is 96 🤔
Me after watching this: * quits my job to sell water bottles at the beach*
I SWEAR TO GOD IF RYAN DOES NOT GET SUNSCREEN BY DAY 4😭😭
Jesus loves you so so much and he died for you so we can be forgiven and go to Heaven with God if you accept Jesus as our Lord and Savior so repent from your sins. God bless you🙏🏼
i want more ;-;
Sometimes Business is a gamble you need to spend to earn.
with that wholesome attitude he can literally sell anything to anybody ❤ wish I could donate but the website is blocked from my country ISP....wish you all the best! 🔥Mrwhosetheboss love you too
yo ryan if you plan on crossing through arizona DO NOT go through phoenix, Tuscon, Mesa, or ay of the desert areas becasue the heat here is like highs of 105 degrees. So probably stick to Flagstaff, Prescott, or somewhere up north or AZ if you plan on it
Number 1 on trending Ryan!!

amazing Ryan you are amazing. I'm like thinking that at this moment on day 4 you are like maybe traveling while im watching this video. It feels good
One more penny to the bucket
Love you Ryan but the way you raw dogged that burrito is concerning. Salsa is free and comes in so many varieties you should be pouring it on, it's literally amazing, try it next time.
I like this series its very Fun to watch
I can surely tell you that the thumbnail  of this video got ryan 2x more views than usual (:
the phone guy donated

Various countries in Africa:" Welcome to day one of what we lived for ever".
I just wonder where does his cameraman go when he's the only one holding the camera
I want to know how this man got the burrito so cheap.
I was at Knotts Wille you film this
we’re u at mcdonald’s at the stratosphere yesterday or am i going crazy cause i swear i saw u at like 9 at night 😐 (if not i found like your doppelgänger)  edit: i’ve made a prediction, you’re in nevada 😈😈
is tge stranger named tony has a last name called crandel if  it is its my uncle
every time he uploads it makes me smile
Jimmy better be watching these videos.
my name is ryan too :)
with one hundred dollars i think you should have rented a car and should have been off to south carolina
You survived on one penny a day for 30 days okay I got some oceanfront property in Illinois would like to sell to you
Great content ! but no one from Asia can donate to your website.... if you can fix that, it would be great !
I can’t donate cause I live in Australia
6:15 omg those dogs
Isaiah Photo as #2 on the donation list??? Hmmm.... That name sounds familiar....
with this being the second time Ryan buys and has returned a cooler he should just permanently buy one for the inventory so that way its safe from THE GREAT RESET
Chipotle should sponsor you!!! Made me want to go get a burrito.
This Ryan guy he looks like a great guy with a great personality and a good heart he greets everyone and he always has a smile in his face he looks like a nice guy inside out
LETSSGOTOMMY
I have determined that he is filming these videos 4 days early. This video was filmed on Monday,.and he started on Saturday.
Guys can someone tell me the name of the soundtrack he keeps putting on that one that sounds like an Abba song please
Love the videos Ryan keep it up  Btw i am 13 and have better facial hair than u do 🤣
Is no one questioning how he got a chipotle burrito for $7? Why that be costing me like $14
I think there should be a promotion on water. You should still have 1 bottle of water $2, but $3 for 2 bottles of water.
Lol 2 of my most watched guys one with arch nemesis rock and other with iOS vs Android both have money
You should try medal detecting you never know what you can find
noice.
Ryan you should do from Florida to Canada:)
Hey ryan my name is Nathan and my birthday is on june 14th (flag day) and i was wondering if i could get a happy birthday shoutout? if not that would be ok but this is kind of something i’ve wanted for a while now so thanks for being an amazing creator and person in general
U GOT THIS!!!!!
Pheonix
I’m loving the daily uploads!
Thats it boys, we broke the 100 dollar mark
if he can make that much selling waters, there shouldn't be 38 million people starving in America

STOP SHOWING FOOD YOUR MAKING ME SO HUNGRY AND ITS 11:14PM I CANT GET FOOD AAAAA
Was put into a lockdown at school today. Was terrified for my life and I’m still stricken with horror. Thank you for the deep breaths, Ryan. I’m far more grateful that I’m breathing now than I’ve ever been.
Hey i like this series
Bro making more in a day than I did working a full shift at pizza hut lmao
If Ryan kept this up for like a week he could literally buy a plane ticket straight to North Carolina 😂
Tbh he’s awkwardness makes his video 10 times better !!
Bet someone pays 50,000 at 29 days
Bro should just buy a plane ticket there
My mom saying: go make some money
Literally faster to earn lots more money from a job within one week rather then do this route
Bro you just make my day better, I would totally buy water from you
How fun
CONGRATS ON TRENDING RYAN !!!! 🎉🍾🎉⭐️✨
water > soda
LETS GO TONY!!!
AIR BNB PLEASE
Stupid title to overall video, idea of video is never fully displayed nor true. You keep things from the audience that are accessible to everyone. There’s no point to making this video since it can’t apply to those that are more unfortunate financially.
5:45 horses
The thumbnail lol 🤣
''RYAN IM BRYAN RYAN''
Can I please get a shout out on the 15th it’s my birthday
I have heard Cali beaches were amazing, and they look great
Pog Series :D
Wait how much does DoorDash pay?
no
a flight from LA to NC is $121
If someone donates 100,000 does he have to go into the negative amount of money
These daily videos make some so happy to watch, I look forward to them every day 😊
This person always tries to do something new and extraordinary and make his audience feel excited for every next video,Love you.🥰😍😍🥰🥰🥰
Dude just think a Billionaire watched this video and decided to have some fun and reset every time you make more progress hahaha It will be insane... also free publicity for whoever does it. News will surely pick it up. :D
Ryan is always so funny especially because of his social awkwardness
that one kid looked a lot like quinn MY GUY
are you realated to ben trahan?
$2 for a water is indeed way overpriced, even the school cafeteria is cheaper
Big fan

I subbed B)
Extremely entertaining wao!
When your in Iowa get soda

Most people copy's your content and fakes it but this is just outstanding!
Bro I love this series! Exited for part 4😄
wow wow wow
Ryanes is not like most other people, he doesn't fit in well. and I respect that.
just buy crypto and keep ur money there for great reset because it is and item in ur "inventory "
When he reaches Texas he has to go on a manhunt for my boy Quin
ryan pro tip: put ice before the drinks
you are so much fun to watch!!! What you are doing is so amazing and cool! God bless!
did he actually use 'emo' as shorthand for 'emotional'...
GTA beach irl
Imagine they reset
i think it's the cooler that got more people to buy, because it is like a stranger giving you and opened candy bar.
This is how many meals there are so far 2672700 meals
6:55 is that
Ryan pls use Sunscreen, it rlly hurts to see u get sunburned
This series has taught me that you can turn one small thing into something big. Keep up the great work Ryan! LETS GO TOMMY!
hahaha thats easy... come to latin america
how come he only has 1 day in each video?
If you ask for a water cup in chipotle you can get soda  🤣🤣🤣 my brother did it an my mom yelled at him
11:12 that was hilarious
if Ryan posted daily he would take over the whole trending page
lol
i love the part he chased down the dude on the bike
I love ryan he’s always positive!!

NOW WE ALL CAN BELIEVE THAT THIS MAN CAN DO ANYTHING WITH A PENNY
or you could use clout mone
I love your videos pls make more like this
I'm never throwing a penny away after this
Where his first cooler ?
Very nice indeed
Glad he takes a moment to thank God
I can't believe that so many people gave him over $2 for a water
Consider where your soul will spend eternity, heaven or hell.  You don’t want to end up in hell because you rejected the Sacrifice Jesus has made all who repent and turn to him by faith.  We are all guilty of sin.  We lie, steal and look with lust in our hearts.  We are all Guilty before a Holy and Righteous God.  GOD is not just all loving and overlook your sin.  He is loving, but sin He will Judge because He is Perfectly good. The Good news is God the Father sent His Son Jesus Christ who was perfectly Holy to pay the penalty for your and my sin out of Love for us.  We can’t keep the Law we break most all commandments.  But Jesus fulfilled ALL by his perfect thoughts, words, deeds and motives for us because we could not. Jesus loved all humans and God the Father perfectly.  Turn, repent of your sin and confess Your thankfulness for what Jesus did for you.  Put your faith in the perfection and the righteousness of Christ.  Jesus was raised from death to give you new life; death has been defeated. Out of love and grace eternal life is promised to those who have faith. ......                       . .  . .           /          /.,                   , ./, .   /.,,./.
im commenting on every video i see, subscribe!

good video
dude dis man the goat
His sunburn is painful to watch.
The Bible says that no one is a good person. We have all broken God's law the 10 commandments, we have all committed, lies, adultery, idolatry, and blasphemy. We deserve hell, but because of what Jesus did on the cross we can be forgiven. So if you Repent of your sins, change your wicked ways, and put your faith in Christ you will be written in the book of life. 👌 🙏Repentance is reviewing one's actions and feeling contrition or regret for past wrongs, which is accompanied by commitment to and actual actions that show and prove a change for the better.
put buy (3 get one free) on your water sign. and thats how you make money
invisible camera man
try to write $2 instead of $2.00
All the 99c stores in America must love you
you spent your Penny for a pen
I have a micro scope lmao
the great reset needs to hapen
Beach+Water = Rich. (Facts of this vid.)
Be watching normally then noticing that we have the same watch, me now just stare at watch
i dont know how i feel abt 2 dollar water when you could maybe MAYBE sell them for 1 dollar each and maybe get more buyers 40 of them so 40 dollars in total plus tips and you buy 40 for 5 dollars. DO YOU THINK ITS WORTH IT TO SELL THEM FOR 1 or 2 DOLLARS?
I thought this guy was jake paul for a second
How do you edit your videos?
This video is sponsored by Coolaid Gum
i need to go to LA n sell water
if you get to Arizona, I might meet you.
This video shows that people that are poor/poverty or in debt can rise up in sales, money and live a normal life. This video *Inspires*. You've earned a sub man.
You can buy 40 waters for $5 but he sells 1 for $2???
The start of the video is sus
I’m going to die if a try what Ryan is doing
Now we know if you need money spend a day in LA selling water for $2.
5:54 Your not that guy pal, trust me. Your not that guy.

Do this challenge in india
It took me a solid 3 minutes of selling water to realize I was at that beach while at a 7on7 football tournament back in March. Almost stepped on a heroine needle...
This was amazing Ryan cant wait for the next video also who else loves Ryan Trahan?!!!!!!
Ryan are you poor or rich?
I love him he’s so awkward
There are 7k comments and if you manage to find mine ur a legend. Have a nice day :D!
where did your bicks go
That shows determination. You can do anything you put your mind too. Love what you are doing.
Pro tip Ryan, if you tie a string to the bottom of the sign and then around your waist it won’t fly around as much :)
Dude He Has So Much Ambitions, I Could Not Run Like a Mile And He Run Like Miles
This kind of hustle and gumption will take you far in life.
Wa saa dude good Luke man you won’t need it
idea. go to long beach and rent out a room on the Queen Mary (if its open)
nice tip: buy very cheaper
don't see police on horses much these days
Bro this guy is so entertaining
You sould try selling girl guide cookies
These videos help me wake up in the morning

I’m sorry but Maybe I might maybe donate 50,000 sorry 🤭🤭🤭🤭
I love this series
Yay a new video
It makes me rrly happy watching ur vids
Thank you so much for going through all this hard work for our entertainment
You re-bought the cooler?
Get yourself a sun screen 😭😭😭 absolutely love this series of videos btw!! You can do it!!
Gtfoh👎 Youtube please stop wasting my data with these stupid recommendations!
I’m so glad I’m not the only one who returns things after they’ve served their purpose 😂😂😂  Alright, let’s hear some funny return stories 😉
Go for broke
Yesterday you had 7.45 mil now you have 7.55 mil followers! Yay

Let’s start a Howdy Chain  Everyone comment on this comment “Howdy 🤠”
Loving the daily uploads!!!!
Bro I was there 2 weeks ago
He feels so happy and joyful that makes one of us😢
Ryan the next city you go to do Uber eats door dash Postmates anything that delivers so you can make decent money my mom had to do this and made about 100 dollars a day
I love these episodes

49ers fan count so far: 2
I forgot one of my favorite YouTubers were coming to my state
i doneate 200k
Definition of hardworking respect my guy 🫡
He makes more money selling water then delivering food. How? (Probably because people pay extra for water)
"Im gonna eat this burrito in 2.1 seconds" ryan: eats it in more than 2.1 seconds even sped up
Also, get a burrito bowl with extra meat and ask for a side tortilla. You'll get two full burritos my guy
What if he got all the way there and forgot the penny...😔
I have a suggestion use that app that pays you in prizes for walking 🥳🥳🤓🤓
Bro found infinite money glitch
Ryan you said 2 seconds not 6
It would be crazy if someone reset him on th 29th day
Yo Ryan,  I am grateful for you :)
Man made my day love when he posts
yesssss episode 3
RYAN I'M BRYAN RYAN
Las ageleis lollll
My man is making a 1338% markup on them water bottle prices lmao way to work.
You should buy a vending machine :)
Is that Just me or is that the beach from GTA
hi
Such wholesome content. Keep it up man!
I love th music
still wondering why he bought another cooler
I bet he is going to phoenix
Mr. Trahan, you have earned yourself a new subscriber. I’ve only seen a few of your videos before, and this is the first of this series I’ve seen. It wasn’t the one-penny-per-sub that made me subscribe, though that is certainly a cool thing in and of itself. It was 10:46, where you said to just be grateful to God for breathing. About ten years ago now, I had a rare, non-cancerous tumor in my left sinus, which left me unable to breathe through my nose. It was big enough to completely close my left nostril and push the bridge of my nose so that I couldn’t breathe through the right nostril, either. It took the doctors over a year to figure out what it finally was, and they couldn’t tell if it was cancerous or not until they took it out. I was only about ten, so I didn’t really know what was going on, but I knew it was bad. I had to breathe through my mouth for over a year, even at night while I was sleeping, leaving my mouth dry and bloodstained every morning. It had been so long that I had forgotten what it was like to breathe through my nose or even smell. After the surgery, I could breathe through my nose again and it was like my eyes had been opened. I had never been more grateful for something so simple, but it’s been so long since then that I’d forgotten. You made me remember the thing I’m so grateful for that we take for granted every day. Thank you Mr. Trahan. And, if anyone ever reads this, thank you for reading my page of a paragraph.
100k challenge complete krdo ❤
Wait he said happy Memorial Day? That’s was like 4-5 days ago
Remember the guy in the first episode? The one who gave him a pen for a penny? He started this…
Keep the train going; LETS GO TOMMYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
All the things he does that he thinks is cringy is so funny is that just me
I am so excited for the next video!
Ryan you need some merch
Who remember Quinn
amazing :D
I think I am gonna try this in India
I know it’s too late bc this was monday but there’s bike racks on the back of busses
People: ''Do you have social anxiety?''   Ryan: ''Yes but no"
no soda bruh
I’m going on vacation
You cross America with money fidias cross the americo with not using any money
buger!!!
Ryan you do things that i thought was never even possible.
buy an sun screen
Ryan you are so entertaining and i love penny chaligeis  so 30 more days of this is awesome
pre recorded?? he said its memorial day so he's not putting them out as he makes them. It's a great series but y'd u lie
jonathan tharp i know you're watching this. yes you but not u other jonathan tharps the one thats bout to be a 9th grader. that one.  i know youre watching this.
idea: if somebody or a company donates $100,000 or more you must automatically quit the challenge
Why are bus tickets so expensive? I live in a city and there's no tickets, anywhere in the town is around 16 cents.
He is so sweet to people! like even if the people are rude to him. I would not last a minute😂
Bro spending money to get money XD
How does he charge his phone?
DADDY DADDY DADDY❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤
Bruh i feel bad hes doing these for content :(
That one guy who said his water was too high priced, he should see it now >:)
Obsessed with this!!!
he spends 32 bucks or so on the cooler. then 5 bucks on the water, he gets 40 water bottles and in theory if all sell for 2 bucks, he'd have 80 bucks after, resulting in 43 profit. And if he kept the cooler, next session, if he sold all water bottles he would have 75 dollar profit lol
Hey ryan suggestion. Put salt in the cooler with the ice so the water will be so cold
.
how much is the sun burn worth?
goat
11:15 jotaro in the back
hi good job your doing well
When are u editing😂😂
6:55  Is that Quinn my guy or am I blind??!!
sell the bike and purchase a bus ticket
I wonder how many times he’s recorded himself in a different perspective while he was biking and had to run back because he had to get his camera 😃
Ryan,  I dmed u and im DOING THE SAME THING that ur doing, i was selling sodas and i made 44 dollars U HAVE Competition HEHEHEHHE love ur vids btw
Ryan should buy a bell omg if he wants people attention that's my opinion if he decides it
Just Subscribed. love what your doing, keep it up!
Can I get a shout out for Mr. whoseaboss and Isaiah photo? What great caring people
As someone who follows political conspiracy theories, every time you said the great reset I thought of your face merged with klaus schwab
2:51
There will never be enough appreciation for the actions that has taken. Such a good guy.
"The Great Reset" will never get old. Love you Ryan, keep up the great work your an amazing person.
So you're telling me you could make $100+ a day selling water in venice beach?
Hello wassup if you see this then dont click on “read more”                  Never gonna give u up
omg thanks for this daily upload, i keep running out of vids to watch
What part of Cali is this it’s so pretty
Happy national dounut day☆
I don’t have the money to donate,but if I did I would but I will keep supporting the videos! (I don’t have the money cause I’m a ten year old btw)
If that bus ticket is for Phoenix, good luck in that weather without a hotel
Ryan, buy a hat so your face doesn’t get burned, make it on of the circle ones so it guards your neck
What’s the song title at 0:48 ???
Tip try saving some of your food
He looks like a Dutch person biking everywhere😂🤣
Hi
Yaas work on th beard!!! U got dis!
Him selling water made me thirsty!
Invest into some sunscreen daynm xd
The evolution of earning money is so great to watch and also amazing.
yay war day
Dude if you follow the path in the beginning you'll be going through my home town. And my hometown is tiny
I got so cringed when he started dancing
W vid
5       Of        Them.  Lol 😂 the voice
bros in gta  (great video tho)
I hope you make it on you journey I will check in tommorow about u
wait till the IRS gets a hold of this video
Plz buy sunscreen
You also Inspired me to become a youtuber
This is 10 hours But I don’t know how are you gonna make it
you could sell that bike if u can't take that bike with ya
5:27 Wait, are the subtitles right or did he actually “Y’all want water too” instead of “one or two?” Hmmmm
this is so fun to watch
Man as much as it works, I can’t help but notice that they use the same 5 second clip from 2 songs quite repetitively in these videos😅
I just wanna know what he said to return it for 2 nd time
Fun fact that you didn't need to know: there was 5 (3 in the shot at 10:31)  teslas in this video, which means that Ryan needs to make another "Tesla Autopilot across the country" series
Hey Ryan, do you play Roblox???
U could of drank that cold Ice.water that u tipped out
Everyone says that the water is to expensive but when they go to the gas station one water bottle is 3 dollars 😂
What if he sold water and soda😏
Thank you for being you. You are putting so much smiles on peoples faces and giving people entertainment. You matter, thank you!
You said that you needed a microscope to see your facial hair I'm not even 15 and I have more than you
Zane I am supposed be home
why dont bro get 43$ of pennies and buy pens and then sell them a dollar each
'We're Gonna Get Some H2Omg' Got me laughing lol
Best thumbnail ever
I donated 45$ and on the thingy it had the same number
You can bring a bike on a greyhound and I think you should. Please don’t get rid of the bike!
How is it day thrree already
Ryan Bryan💀
I've technically been to California to Florida by car same thing right???
New jobs be like:
bro's living in gta
bro next investment gotta be sunscreen and some like aloe vera lotion for that burn
0:01
Advice if you come to Utah: everyone here loves sodas. It's basically our lifeline. We love sodas so much so, that there are crazy long lines for Soda Shops all over the state. Go to Northern Utah, that's where all of the people are. People here though probably won't be as generous as those in L.A, but $2 is average for sodas, even $2.50 would be considered good. If you do pass through Utah, Good Luck!
Bro chipotle is not $7 wtf, where is this location
I am now typing this comment for absolutely no reason.
Cops didn’t ask for a PERMIT I wonder why WP smh
I don’t think anyone is gonna donate in the thousands
My dog died Friday June 3
since Memorial Day was last week, that means that right now you are out and about, and that's weird to think about. I wonder what you're doing.
Brilliant video!!! Loving what your doing
people will defently bi beer form you if you go to another party
Ngl, the idea of wearing out the tyres on a cooler only to return it is a little disshonest. He should just keep it
We are called Los Angelenos 😁
W creator you will blow up as your content is very original
LETS GO TOMMY!
Ryan is probably asleep right now
This is insane
KEEP DOING IT!
Seeing this recommended like ah dang I missed day two :(
10:47 George Floyd couldn't relate.
watching a millionaire spend hours trying to make 100$ is strangely entertaining
I go on a field trip this Friday it was so fun
wow
man's playing gta 5
At the start it reminds me of number 1 of stranger things when he says to eleven hey sleepy head
Ryan surviving on $0.01 but the camera man over here surviving on absolutely nothing
i feel in love with the outro, i want to see this series till the very end keep it up.
Am i late?
Omg
Ryan’s videos he always gets at least 2 or 3 friends
the cooler is adorable when it wobbles, you better rebuy it
Just a little tip try to make some deals on water sales, like 2 for 3$ etc, maybe more sales at a time
I LOVE THIS SERIES
Man is really smart with the cooler return method
i just got 7 accounts to sub to you! i hope you get to the 1MIL meals, ryan!! <3
Bro Ryan made the big money this day
bro shoulda got the ralphs store card for the deal smh
And a go-kart attachment $33
Get $130 to buy a hoverboard
day 3 of commenting on this series
It is better to start with a penny than go to work, literaly Ryan got a 100 bucks just from selling water...I going to change my job...
Showed my family this video series. This was the first time they've seen your videos. They are hooked 😎 my Dad asked if your next video came out this morning 😆
I dont know how this man survives being embarrassed so many times
What is the music in the backround!!!!! I need it so bad!
tenth of the way through, congrats
cmon guys lets get him near the great reset so he gets scared and use most of his money on stuff
If 1 million people gave me a penny I'd have 10k
We're already one fourth of the way!
You should make a tacos stand to make money in the next episode
watch earlier vids
Bro your on day 3 and you already made over half you did on day 2. YOUR AMAZING
R U A Christain?
I like watching this series while eating
Gotta love ryan
It said 5,99 then you paid 7 quid eh
Dam bro u made 100 dollars in 1 day
omg mr whostheboss!
I want to see him in irl while doing the challenge so I can give him money lol. If you’re still in California, I want to give you money. Also the place where you were, I was there a few weeks ago.
Funny how the queens jubilee is the same day as Memorial Day…

I wonder how Ryan feels with half of his comments calling him awkward
It’s crazy to think that he is doing this challenge right now at this moment 🧐
its great what hes doing
Okay I now know that to make money you don’t study and become a lawyer u just go to America and sell water
4:54 is bro wearing a hoodie at the beach?
I wish I could have like a fraction of your charisma. Also love the awkward moments, it's not really that awkward but i love it
I miss  Quinn

How many waters?  “👁👁👩🏼✋🏻“
Ryan you need to decrease it by $2 because someone gave you it for nothing and you said all profit must come from the penny.
Where part 2
I’m starting to get concerned that the only reason I’m watching this series is for RYAN TO BUY SOME DAMN SUNSCREEN!!!! 😭
Buy sunscreen…
Should stay in la until you can buy a plane ticket
I am gonna watch this series for an entire month with is amazing
How
5:55 is when ryan tripped
if you hit minnesota come through mpls
Gta 5
what if just no one donates $50,000?
Mans killing it so far
30 days of entertainment!
I already have a girlfriend I didn’t even do anything I just said hi
Honestly, If dr.phil was watching this I KNOW he would be proud and he would love this
WHERE the Hell did ur bike go
I have a microscope
Selling chips and sodas is literally such a good idea for even kids wanting extra cash, depending on your countries laws.
Ryan you are on something Kool-Aid gum is the nastiest thing ever bro is it flavor after five seconds and it just becomes this nasty rubber gross thing
The gum loses its flavor in 15Secs lol
There will soon be a documentary about all of this stuff he does
I'm starting to realize these 'i survived on' videos are just you illegally reselling merch from stores lol
Awesome loved it
Where is your grey hoodie with zipper from??
what was ryan doing at 0:21?????
Happy day 8 Ryan
Griddy practice is most important on Memorial Day
As an mexican person seeing people eating stereotype mexican food makes me happy, but what i don’t understand is: why so many people like taco bell?, the things in there are overloaded with cheese
Ryan should try to get 1k dollars he gets hundreds so fast
So im guessing jimmy is gonna end up donating 50k
Hey Ryan how can I send you money for sunscreen?
and now its this
ur so awkward at times and its soo funny lollll
So I unsubscribe and then resubscribe! 12:04
Hey yo, make a trip to north Texas and visit a taco bell, even if you don't end up at mine there are items for a dollar or even 2 plus taxes and they fill me up well so 5 or less Dollars spent on 2 items isn't THAT bad
These videos are the best
I subscribed :)
could you make a similar video with the cameraman hidden from start to finish ?  im curious about people reactions , doesnt matter if its  short video, pls
bro this is gonna be a loooong month
Great job keep it up
You should of get 1 water for 1.50$ and you should of gave them 1 piece of ice with the water
When a potatoes saying rhino
*Grabs a microscope* yep no hair.9:02
If he is in Los Angeles and I’m in Los Angeles how did it get dark that fast and it’s not even night time for me?

Go to Santa Anita park and sell beer 🍺
one day come to TN please!!!!
Buy soda and sell it
I love this series
God loves you all and you can all be saved (if not already) by just putting faith in Jesus Christ and repenting of sins (turning to God from sin and changing your ways for God) And you should ask for forgiveness of your sins (this can be anywhere) have a nice day  Jesus is my lord! And the solution to hell!  And good deeds are kind acts that the person doing it has no cost for it.  And I'm not a bot. ..
I love how that one guy just walked up to him and said Ryan I’m Brian Ryan
Love these videos!!! Keep it up!!!!
Why did you read this?
Loved this thanks for another amazing video!
Everyday blogs is the best thing to ever happen
Go Ryan!
Ryan will be very rich soon
You should just buy a big whitboard insted of paper so the whiteboard can just rub off and u can write something else simple bro

Nothing better than having a tasty burrito after a long day of selling water am I right? It just makes the burrito so much better when you have earnt it, and you my friend have done a great job so far! I can tell this is going to be a very fun series and I can’t wait for more :)   P.S you have gained +1 sub  And I appreciate what you are doing to help people less fortunate than us!
Never say Happy Memorial Day. I've seen a lot of people make that mistake, and no hate. Just don't say it from here on out.

Who ever that tony person is, that’s very sweet of him.❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🖤🤍🤎

Hello ryan, happy good day. I wanna know if you can make this challenge in poor country. Thank you and sorry for my bad english🔥
I love his cringeyness and awkwardness in a good way
i love this series
God bless you Ryan 🤧🙏
Why doesn’t he keep the cooler? He’s obviously going to need it again
I bet the next city is either Las Vegas or pheonix arozona
Ho
$58.00
Love this type of content
i like how ryan isn't like other vloggers/youtubers who are really confrontational with people and ryan is much much more relatable in situations
its so funny with peple trying to say no thankyou nicely
Woah. I can't believe they made a city based on los Santos from gta
sup
Hu
returning the cooler - big brain

I made sure to sub
DAY 3 POGGG
Get a motorized bike kit or buy a moped and drive it to thr other end

A way to skip the effects of the great reset is to buy something keep it over the great reset and sell it afterwords effectively keeping money over the great reset
im begging you
someone pls donate 50k
Why
Whenever you say howdy you laugh
Weow
It’s crazy how while watching this video he is still doing this
This month will be the most insane in history
At this point he could buy a plane ticket and be there tommorrow lol

Day 2 of trying to get Ryan to buy sunscreen: cmon I don’t want u to become a tomato

I’m Australian what it Memorial Day? (I have no idea)
anyone else unsub then sub again lol-???
Daily vlogging done right
unscribes      **subscribes** (cent acquired)
It is time to get right with Jesus. You aren’t going to automatically enter into heaven if you have lied or stolen or had premarital sex. Even one of those makes you worthy of hell fire.  Don’t deceive yourself! The punishment of sin is hell fire.  Jesus died so you can get a clean slate and forgiveness of a future sin when we confess it. When you start to follow him you have to strive to obey what he commands.  No one will enter heaven without the blood of Jesus. No other way but through Jesus.
ur the best
that burrito made me crave chipotle
I live in LA and i drink soda
beach beach let's go get away,
This guys personality is pretty cool
Hi
Is it just me or every time Ryan posts it makes your day better
Ryan if your ever feeling lonely on you adventure then just give me a call
You should write a deal 3 for £5 so ppl think it’s much better deal and buy more

Lol
696969696969696969
Lol I donated 500 dollars instead
Yo mrwhosetheboss donated!
Believe in Jesus. Salvation doesn't come from our good deeds or by doing anything special, it's a free gift from God just because He loves us so much. We need to turn away from our sins, believe that Jesus is God's Son and our Savior, and submit to Him as Lord of our lives. By doing so, we receive salvation and eternal life!
10:08 you didn't love the vids btw
All the cool people are from Texas.
how did you not tak a dumb after eating at chipotle 💀
I think that the guy just took the $18. Not a mistake :0
What about Taxes-
Ryan has put all this effort into us show support
Ryan, in the next challenge you do like this, can you try not to sell bottled water it’s really bad for the environment.
I love it but I could never. If i don't do my skin care my acne goes wiiild. Nobody would like to buy water from me
If you want to know the burrito bowl actually does more for the buck
@MrWhoseTheBoss with the $5k dono! I love that guy!
Congrats u made it this far with over 100$

I can’t believe *THE GREAT RESET* hasn’t happened yet          It will happen soon
I want a piece of grass for subscribing.
why doesent ypur camera man buys water
if each cent is equal to 1 meal then 1 dollar which is 100 cents is equal to 100 meals, and 10000 dollars is equal to 1 million meals which means where are the other 90,000 dollars going hmmm. sounds a bit sus to me just pointing it out, cause I know that 100,000 dollars will not be equal to 1 million meals.
who need netflix when u got Ryan
Well now we know that people from LA enjoy water more than soda👏🏻💀
Lez go Brian
i broke my hand a minute after number 2 released during school

You already have lots of money
Next time you sell water tape the sign to your cooler so it’s not in your face👍
Yesss i need the new episode alrady
Some of the people might have known you were doing a charity challenge.
this is such a great series of videos
Try going to a concert and collect plastic bottles and empty cans and you’ll get $0.05 for each can
What is this thumbnail 😂😂😂
You could buy a bus ticket and then hustle your way up to a plane ticket instead?
lets all  save up money to make the great re set
THE GREAT RESET
somebody needs to track him down and hinder him
They didn't buy it because its called POP
WE NEEEEEED LIVE CONTENT
this was the perfect thing to wake up 2
ryan dude your profit from the water was actually onley 65 not 106 cus you pait 43 dollars to get everything
I love this!!!

I’m so exited for this series. I’m most happy that we get daily uploads lol, keep the good work
You can tell this dude is genuine.

Me not doing my homework to watch him
When he say howdy it sounds like How Deez LOLL
Hi
Day 2 of asking Ryan to buy a cap or hat ._.
you should have just rented the bike for couple days
$108 for a case of water that was $5 in the first place😂
Saying "Happy Memorial Day" in the US - 😀 But in Israel - 😨
bro when he parked his bike I went, wait what about the bike and through the whole vid the bike wasn't with him(till the end) so I kept saying WHAT ABOUT THE BIKE?!
Sell Prime bruv
Big shoutout to the camera man going through that every day!
I think people expect there to be very illegeal stuff in the cans like “coke” where with water you can see if there’s anything inside.
What is a person from Los Angeles watch this video and said but I do drink soda
Congrats you are awesome
" a stranger named Tony once told me to take 3 deep breaths and thank God every day" little nod to Tony Robbins?
what happens in the next video? does ryan get stabbed in an alley? does he make it across america? find out in the next part of this crazy mf does things i never would dream of doing
This got 104k likes in 7hrs
9:18 Ryan: HMGAH!
I unsubed and subed back to. Make ryan donate 🤣
I genuinely love this guy
Someone should pay the great reset just as he thinks he’s done it on the 30 day so it feeds people and he will get mroe subscribers trending on what happened
An Amtrak ticket, for LA to Raleigh NC is like 250 dollars, you could get that in like a week
This guy makes more money from selling water for an hour than our parents do in an hour combined.
7 hours early
Water is the strat
best content ever keep it up btw 13:06 he became devil bro lol
I can’t believe someone scammed you of $18! That’s not cool…
What's the outro song? O_o
need to make sure i keep on top of these
How could anyone hate ryan?
The Great Reset
Shoutout to the editor and filmer. They're behind the scenes making these videos (that usually take a couple weeks to make) every single day for 30 days.
wdym its memoreal day
I think any money given from people who know you or people who hear you going across America for a penny story should not count. Because if someone told me that I’d give them so much money and it’s less authentic for the challenge
Next time ur in LA come drop by my house please😊
you should sell the water for 1.50
Love you Ryan ❤️
It would be so nice ridding your bike around
While I was watching this I was eating one of those Kool-Aid gums
At the end of this series Ryan will have made about 1 mil
What if i un an resub
Oh my gosh i love the music holy thank you for posting!
I like how he started with a penny

When Ryan hit 1 thousand dollars I want him to scream

Sadly, it is not possible to donate, from Germany, since we do not have credit cards usual. Is there a way to donate via PayPal?
You should buy a cab to wherever you need to go  It can take u to mrbest I think
What I learnt from this is that selling water is much more profitable then some jobs

Best time of the day
“ryan i’m bryan ryan” -😎
People are so nice to you
It’s so weird how I wake up and I just know, Today Ryan is gonna be slowly crossing America 😂
HE USED HIS PHONE
the cringe  isn't cringe?
by the end of this challenge, ryan's gonna be a different ethnicity after all the sun
Ryan Kinda reminds me of the good old days when content creators did actual challenges.
Hello Mr. Trahan. I hope that, even if you don’t make it in time, that you end up in the state you love most. If the great reset is in a few days, I’d advise that you spend all your money. (Probably a week or so before the great reset happens, as to not worry about what to spend money on [Trust me, when you have ADHD and you procrastinate, I know what to do and not do from experience])
what about $150,000 you do the greater reset which means you gotta reset all the way which means you get rid of your money and your items execpt for hammock or your choice.
fun
Ryans just genuine he’s the best
thanks
You returned a cooler you used in the sand. You know returns end up in a land fill and you don't actually NEED the money, right?
I love how you really make the most of everything and appreciate it all !
Woah it was at 13k yesterday, and now it’s at 29k!! Amazing :0
POV you trying to go across America with a cent
MrWhoseTheBoss with 5k! Nice!
cake.
Why is it only day 3 :sob:
“Ima eat this burrito in 2.1 seconds.” Casually eats it in 5.
How do you charge your equipment?
i think hes going to Las Vegas
Should I tell Mr. B’s to donate $50,000
I love disease videos
How does he charge his phone...
If these videos are live can you say happy birthday to joel on june 27th please. Thank you. 😀

I've been watching from South Africa, really enjoying this series and can't wait to see what further adventures you'll get up to!
The Great Reset positions Ryan does are just beautiful

Commenting until Ryan responds to me again  Video 49
I'm not trying to call Ryan out, I'm just curious... 1) How are you charging your phone? 2) Are you depositing the money in a bank account (previously empty) to make online transactions? Since your profit is straight cash... JUST CURIOUS! 👍 Keep it up man, this is a great series.
“We found a secluded alleyway to count our money”  ✨Legend✨
Great 27 more to go
4.3 seconds*
Bro just left the bike

Ryan's world

You should make a series where you survive for 1 week only by doordashing
with each passing day, Ryan gains more confidence :]
Find it funny how him making like 70 bucks off 3 24 packs of soda has somehow turned into people not drinking it
Ryan, you should get sunscreen just to protect yourself from skin cancer. Either with or without the budget you have. You should protect your skin at least somehow.
****IDEA**** you could buy a mini whiteboard and dry erase markers and write drawing what you want for ___ dollars?
Im so amazed that Ryan still hasn't found a way to buy sunscreen😂
imagine if someone made a game based on this
I'm trying to get across America from a $0.01. Keep the $5 bro 😂
faxs
bro got rejected by someone he wasnt even hitting on lol
I don’t know if you have it or not, but you have to get sun screen if you are going to be outside.
What's cool is nearly anyone can sell this stuff and get a profit like Ryan.
Jimmy is gonna great reset you bro
Go to 10:35
Just got back from school early with a black eye (don't ask) this just made my day, thanks Ryan!

Hi
I would do this but there is no way im going out asking people to buy my stuff for hours a day its crazy how your still alive tbh
The great reset
Congrats on 100 bucks
just watching how much donated and it suddenly went up and scared me lol
It’s such a miracle he never loses money like he’s never been robbed and someone it never falls out of his pockets if it were me it would be a totally different story
Glad I'm not the only one who thinks 40 waters is a back breaker🤣
If we get you to 10million you do the same thing just across Australia to deliver a penny to laser beam😂😂 you can do this Ryan a Good luck
i love his videos!!! but i am wondering if he eats bc he never spends money on food😂😭 he does sometimes but only once a day haha
It’s a very good Series
tbh ryan stop making SO good videos theyre just too good
on memorial day i had to march and play my instrument for my school band there were 255 students it was funny
Yass I was waiting for part 3 I alredy saw the 1 and 2 I love this videos
Bro what chipotle is getting a burrito for 6 dollars at
0:00 You talking to me?
Try and meet with arriack because he could encourage you
If he goes to Tulsa, I will lose my mind
hi
0:17 That looks like the deodorant for women
A loophole to the great reset: ryan buys a gift card or two(its still an object)
Try selling water again but this time in Africa
I JUST WOKE UP FROM MY NAP AND OH MY WORD THE VIDEO IS AMAZING👏❤️ WE LOVE YOU RYAN KEEP YOUR SUCCESS FLOWING
genius series mate!!
Take cycle for rent bro....
daily uploads??? *insert mega mind raising his eyebrow here*
Ryan out here selling waters in gta 5
Can he just summon the cooler cause some times he has it others he doesn’t
some of the best content ever!!!!
Hi
Ryan's series' are the best on YouTube period. I am so excited for daily uploads omg
Your not soposed to say happy momoriol
Where does this man use the bathroom though lol
dose that guy look like Quinn at 6:54
Epic
Great vid keep it up
so excited to watch this daily for the next 30 days. my new motivation lol
How are you charging the camera
the fact that those women drank water from a famous youtuber
I cant wait for much more of theses <3
Don't you think using your phone is cheating? Also that money from uber isn't coming from the penny
That is so wierd bc yesterday I was in Las Vegas and I saw someone that looked just like you camera man and everything
I love starting my day off with one of these
Who else is coming in Daily to see theses videos?
I genuinely would love to meet Ryan
who here watches this everyday
i think you should try this in canada ! canadians are so nice :^}
The riches this man can accumulate never fails to surprise me, day 3
He found out how to make 100 dollars in 13:34 minutes
Try selling pop in Oklahoma it will sell
what he could of done was sell the cooler for a good 20 bucks
life is good im gonna eat this burrito -Ryan Trahan
i was gonna donate 50000 of of youtube but it said between 1000 and 7000 is what you can only donate
Without even watching the video i am liking this video💕
Ryan could literally make a living from a penny
Day 3 I’m still present 🔥🎉
bro if i was preston i would be so tied
thank you Ryan for the three breath thing it really helped because my last 5 days have been very tough
Imma donate 100k soon
dont break the coller otherwise that would be exspenceve
your my dad
So if this is memorial day today is day 7 or 8 im bad a t math <3
at the end areent these famous ytubers that only donated lol
I just love how those 3 creators donated a massive amount of money without even like really saying that they did to their fans, this just gives us more reason to love these creators.
Congrats on reaching $100
I thought one of the key points of the bike was that it was protected against the great reset, why would you sell it?   You never know when you’ll be sent back to LA.
The surprise city is Las Vegas
Mammy
Me realizing if it was day three on Memorial Day than today he is on day 7
You're gonna go so far to do 0.01 for a year I bet
Wait...Americans DON'T drink soda?! I always thought they loved it lol!
The vids just get crazyer and more crazyer keep the good work up Ryan
FaZip
Great series!
I'm glad your using your wealth for good! Keep up the awesome work!
Why did you return the cooler just to buy another one just to return it again 😭
you can take your bike on some busses
how many days do you think this is going to be i think 26 days
You should save up for a plane ticket. Even if the great reset happens, you can still use a plane ticket.
Thank you for saving me from my Friday depression for 13 minutes 💯👍🏾
Suggestion: rent a air bnb.They are a lot cheaper.
today is acually day 7
Not the guy accidentally scamming you
Thank you Ryan for these awesome videos, you've actually inspired me to buy a bike and door dash myself!
Daily LOG nice
ive been watching these videos as soon as they come because of timezones ,who else
sell the watrs for 2.25 because nobodfy wnats .75 in change so u cna make a bunch of tips
“Ryan I’m Brian Ryan” -Brian
What does everyone thing the city is. My guess is las vegas
i just want ryan to buy some sunscreen 🥺
He is awkward and I LOVE IT
I would of lied the whole video 😂😂
Dude made 18$ and a water
Why did he buy another cooler
13:07....proof that Ryan is the goat
Just buy a plane ticket to North Carolina
That's smart using the cooler once then returning it
I like how he has more then enough money to buy sunscreen and he doesn’t buy any and keeps getting sunburned every day lol
Why does it play the Apex music?
Definitely looking forward to a behind the scenes at some point- maybe a 24 hour livestream?- to see everything that's going on. Great series!
I am in Italy and in that moment it was night, so yea, it was fricking awesome watching a video at night posted 3 minutes ago, but in the video it was morning
Ryan in ten years: I survived the hunger games with no weapons
Popsicle maybe
Hey Ryan you should try to sell water or soda on a boardwalk
Tommy is the next Quinn
Hey tomorrow is my birthday so next video can you buy a small cake and sing happy birth day plzzzzz
its my b-day and its now poring rain with lots of lightning great
Yo Ryan I once had the koolaid gum it was so bad how is it a 11 out of 10
day 3 lets go! 27 days more to go
Anyone else realize he makes a Stranger Things reference every time? 😂 😂 😂
YAY YOUR BACK
That thumbnail tho💀
I know your tryin to make a series but like u could just do that a couple more times for around 700$ and that’s probably enough for a plane ticket and an Uber to the airport
23s In tho
Love you Ryan
Basically Ryan is cheating because he is using his phone for doordash but he always had that phone
You should sell the bike before the bus ride.
Howdy
Hi people
The amount of times he said howdy LOL🤣🤣🤣🤣
Howdy everyone
Cookie 🍪
Howdy 🤠
The amount of time she said howdy LOL🤣🤣
the brito is the same as the biscuts "ill eat this BLAH BLAH BLAH in whatever amount of time" three hours later "TIME!"
You need! To travel through utah
What did you get in that burrito? 🌯
Ryans recording episode 7 while we are on 3 so donations are gonna be delayed by 4
quick tip get a plane ticket!
This is my new fav series
I loved the first week one thx for bringing this back
Wait in America its not Memorial Day and he said its Memorial Day
DID ANYONE NOTICE MRWHOSETHEBOSS AT THE DONATION COUNTER
I literally subscribed seconds before he said every sub donates a penny and I was like oh well that’s a bonus
Make sure your wearing sunscreen bud ☀️🧴 main cause for wrinkles
Hi
If you come to Phoenix then you better wear sunscreen man it’s a lot worse here than LA, plus you might get a subscriber buy a few waters from ya 👀
why dont i see Xavier here
I’m guessing he’s going to phoenix or Tucson
he makes me want to do this
So nice that they let you return the cooler after you use it! Most shops I see do not do that.
chipotle burritos are only $6.84 in LA!?
Your editor at 9:20
soda and water though?
He should’ve gotten a train ticket
Ryan just so you know i will be watching every single one of these videos. gonna be a great series. thank you for posting and making my day brighter.
Honestly Ryan would make a good business man selling product around United States, with his motivation, his kind personality, and dedication to make money to travel across the country
Hello Ryan Trahan I am 13 years old and only two inches shorter than you but Ryan keep up the good work I love your videos and I am subscribed
Not all YouTubers are like Ryan, he seems like such a great person inside and out. Love your content!
returning the cooler is so clutch😂
Excellent content man! Appreciate your authenticity and fun!
love ur vids, just buy some sunscreen my man, im worried 🤣
Dude his awkwardness is hilarious because it's the good kind of awkward not just like awkward awkward
The soda thing wasn't a complete fail
I started to watch Ryan about a year ago, and I can’t stop watching him!
Every time you say Howdy it remind me of my old co worker. This intense then the last penny challenge.
You probably won’t see this, but you are one of the best YouTubers! Whenever I see your video, I smile! Keep on doing what you’re doing, thank you for everything! <3
I love how he’s always like howdy 🤠
It says a lot that he made more money selling water than he did working a legitimate like doordash
The thumbnail worries me
This series brings me so much joy. I know we are gonna make it to the donation goal.
Jesus Christ is lord and savior amen 🙏 🙏 🙏
this guy reminds me of will ferrells elf
Does anybody else think that Ryan is literally one ☝️ the best YouTubers on the platform
this is by far one of my most favorite series by ryan
this series is so good
we love you ryan ❤️
WHEN YOU GET TO NC ILL GIVE YOU A RIDE ANYHERE (like so he can see!)

Is it just me or is this sus 1:09
yo we all have to agree this man is the most positive person alive with great content , heres a note Ryan keep it up!    :)
Wish there were more wholesome people like this guy
If I had the money id donate 49,999.99 thousand dollars so the great reset dosent happen! (;
If you come to Oklahoma you should come to yukon
Hey Ryan u probably won't see this but hi
I really hope that one day those pink shades you wore get put in a museum and have the photo of you wearing them put into a pure gold frame
bruh at 6:54 did anyone else thinks thats collin or is it just me like wtf
i am addicted to this series!
donating 50k rn just to see you suffer for a great cause :D
Now you sell the bike
I was laughing at the thumbnail I swear 😂😂👏
I feel like were all rooting for ryan so much that the great reset is a reason NOT to donate 50k lmao
i will not miss 1 video of dis series
How to do this: 1. Be optimistic and motivated 2. Be an extravert.
Most people are socially awkward, but this man is awkwardly social
This series is the best thing on YT right now.
It’s always the cooler that Ryan goes back to
day 3 was so amazing
PLACE YOUR BETS ON WHERE HE TAKES THE BUS TOO HERE.
👇🏽that’s How many times he said “Sorry” 😅
Hello
Where did you get the bike from cheater

Ryan gives me camp counselor vibes
Bring it to the Mississippi coast. The water at that beach but they love sodass and they are very nice.

he should just save for a plane ticket
I forgot to say I was here on day one so ima say it here
You can use a hostel or AirB&B
I Have 7 channels that are going to subscribe to you Keep up the great work
Can we take a moment to appreciate how fast she makes these videos? He posts everyday, edits and posts!
outro song please?
We won't forget you, let's go Tommy!
The people that won’t donate because they don’t what Ryan to lose his money. You know who you are
It would be funny when the great reset happens

Whoever’s reading this, I pray that whatever your going through gets better and whatever your struggling with or worrying about is going to be fine and that everyone has a fantastic day! Amen

You should give everyone who buys something from u a business card about your mission. Could help to increase your online donations and maybe help encourage people to pay it forward. This world needs more kind hearted people like u Ryan!
You are giving me so good vibes
I thought you meant standing on one cent for 30 days

Nice videos, Ryan!  Also, I know you’re going to Las Vegas. 😈
Detta är ett meddelande för alla svennar som kollar: ha de gött.
8:43 this is the perro heights house from gta 5 online :D
This is such a wonderful thing you’re doing here. Really inspiring to see how hard you are working, and heartwarming too because it’s all for a good cause! I don’t know how it’s going to happen, but I believe in you Ryan. YOU GOT THIS!!!   P.S. Please, buy your poor skin some sunscreen! 😭

Its my birthday today and this video was amazing
Does ur cameraman chatge your phone and applewatch orr

Sell the bike bruhhh
That was 6 seconds- not 2.1- good try tho-
The koolade gum losses all flavor in 5 min
It’s my birthday!
Over $100 in water sales that costs 4.99
You could buy a plane ticket for not much over $200 (LAX to Wichita)
If he's outside on a hammock
These ideas are so awesome ngl I love your videos
How is he charging his phone or camera
Hi Ryan I just started watching you so I am new here I recommend to try to make a lemonade stand it will definitely help bye.

His awkwardness is amazing
Ryan , with all that walking your legs must be riiiiiiipped
I love the great reset
You can make $80 a day if you keep selling the water

Ryan is the type of guy to thank anyone for doing anything even if it doesn't resolve him because you know, he's that good of a guy and I just wish everyone in the world was like Ryan, and dedicated to everything they do, like Ryan!
so far have been watching daily love your content you are the most nice and funny guy I know
Man Ryan Trahan would be a good cowboy.
This is proof that even if you start from a penny you can be successful
Next series is gonna be going around the world from $00.1
Aren’t there bike racks on the front of the buses?
At 12 minutes what if we unsubscribe then resubscribe
i just subbed with 5 accounts!!!
I love your videos! You are so funny. I subscribed!!!!😄
Where’s my penny 😢
Bro you always put a smile on my face keep up the good work :)
if you can donate 100k meals with 0.01$ per subscriber, and have 1m subs, that means, you pay 10k for 100k meals, is it even possible to get 10 meals for 1$?
I never comment on YouTube,  But this has been an amazing series so far, I wake happy and Eager to see more
SCUSE ME BUT HOW IS A BURRITO 6.84 FOR YOU? Is chipotle just mean to the Seattle area lol
A one way ticket from Los Angeles to Raleigh is $139. If he sold more water or did more DoorDash he could’ve probably afforded that.
Bro I just subbed I think your incredible mate I’m from the uk mate you should be so proud of yourself mate amazing work
i know we a ll watch these series' to watch ryan embarass himself and to watch him eat way to many mcchickens
Someone tell Ryan that he can go to a picture Frame Shop and ask for scrap cardboard or damaged mat board to make a sign. That happened regularly when I worked in framing
6:55 is that the legend Quinn
Jark
Love the series so far keep up the good work ❤️
Hey ryan, what if you started at 1000$ then your goal was to make 10,000$ with your 1,000$ budget. Ryan might not see this but hey, it's an idea.
J and
I wasn't subbed (I thought I was) but I just gave a meal!
Yesterdays key phrase give me 1 pennies and I will give you some sunscreen
Wow this arc is insane!
Incorrect lorenzo.
Imagine that even after the 30 days the great reset just never happens
You should learn how to swim
idk why homless peopel dont do that what ryan is doing, its acely smart but a lot of youtubersdo that
Your amazing man
w
Close to a million views in less than 6hrs man .. amazing how far u come .. u inspire me to make better videos and for that thank you Ryan ❤️🔥💯
YO THE DUDE WHO SAID "RYAN BRYAN RYAN" IS MY P.E. COACH
Bro went past my gta flat
Ryan I bet $100 I can grow a moustache before you
These videos are always entertaining, keep up the great work!😃 And I NEED to know what shoes those are!!!!!
This is easily the best YouTube serie I've ever encountered
On your sign you should write ice cold water
These daily vlogs are amazing. keep up the great work
im about to sell overpriced soda at the beach
What shoes is Ryan wearing???
Tony the man!
Wait memorial day? That was monday = you’ll see great reset in some days
awesome thing that you are doing lol
I cant wait to see the new map(the next state), just 24 more hours until the update releases
In Tennessee the time is 2:40pm
Hey Ryan instead of putting the sign on your neck and making it fly everywhere just grab some duct tape and tape it around your stomach or you could use string to that also works. Just give you a suggestion no need to judge me.
You shuld sell La Croix if you are in LA
The camera man 😎🤣🤣
at 8:46 there's a gta5 building
BRB about to go sell some water lol
You need to go back to running
Bro get some sunscreen and aloe Vera
“I’m so emo right now” genuinely killed me lol 😂
at this pace dogs might mistake him for a fire hydrant
Sell Italian ices
The best series ever on youtube
This is how your earn money and not disappoint your family and also make a video out of it and also earn 🙃🙃
Best series on youtube
You're so wholesome, and easy to watch.
Ryan being socially awkward makes it so much more interesting
I am so glad this series is a daily video !
I was at Venice during spring break
me: cool video my brain: how is he editing this quickly wtf
Cool video
LETS GO RAYAN DAY 3
So he’s around 7-8 days in right now
Mans living in gta 5
8:56 I know how hard it must be going to Chipotle instead of Freebirds
Why do u purchase new cooler every time?
I love how this video got 69k views lol

I feel just like you Ryan…. But not raise money, traveling across the US Expect I’m just going from Florida to Indiana so..
Get some freaking sun scream!!
Sorry I don’t know what soda is but I have heard of pop
When you remember he’s posting daily 😳
2:47 what song is that 🥵
Hi! I really love this type of videos! I think the next series could be "I survived on $0.01 for 365 days" and you travel across the world.
and some aloe
was that quinn on the scooter 6:55
STILL LETS GO TOMMY
1 word: burrito time *proceeds to say 2 words*
I love this series!
gta
What is the name of the music ? 😁
Ü
You need to give someone $420.69
one water is 13 cents so you need to cut it down  if you want more sales try selling it at around 100-80 cents (idk what americans use)
Ryan said on day 1 that he had to choose earning money over content, but honestly I could watch Ryan selling water for hours. Amazing content, good luck!
yessssss
I woke up and the thumbnail was the first thing I saw when opening YouTube
Hehe
I love this series
Last Year he did a week on just 1 cent  *HES BACK AGAIN*
Bruh I’ma sell water everyday it’s better then McDonald’s

Jesus Christ saves!
This is a great series I love it
bro ur my 2nd fav youtuber
you need to stop saying howdy
good work
ryan trahan you wont see this but i love you
this is the most original content you can find on youtube
I hate the people who say that the water over priced
when you’re not doing anything you should make a sign that says “pay me to sit” and see if you get anything rather than just waiting there
8:43 only gta players know this place
You could do soda and water may work
Ryan’s awkwardness is so relatable and how he puts himself out there is respectable I don’t think I could do it and I can’t wait for the rest of the series
This is a certified NOOT NOOT classic.
ryan why dont you do a duo or a trio 1 penny challenge
Let’s goo day 3
when he said 2.1 my battery was on 21%
ah yes entertaining comment from my favourite youtuber for 30 days

This series is the perfect match to my dinner. P.S I love in Philippines so the timezone is 12 hours apart and i eat my dinner at 2 am
I like how Ryan does the Great Reset voice and makes it epic which is just so good.

Ryan Trahan
This trend still be going
it's crazy how he found so many ways to save money, for example returning the cooler and gaining the money back
Man I’m loving this series so much

I can relate to Ryan, I don’t fit in well.
Cheaplote
Keep up the great work!

Ryan go to the dollar store the 99 cent store and get yourself some witch hazel and put it on your sunburn it will take the burn out of it. Or mustard
Amazing journey you are on! Keep up the great work
Alternate Series Name: A Guide To Live a Life Starting From a Penny

2:51 where'd the bike go??
Amazing! :>
ryan, hit up the sidemen and break the multiverse
He has a realy good hustle I tried it and I got 100 bucks
RYAN!! Whatever you do, do NOT spend that $0.50 piece! The US Mint doesn’t make those anymore and they’re kinda rare, so I would keep that and sell it at a pawn shop for a bigger price. 😃 (I’m not a coin master so it’s just an idea).
100k?

Hope he comes through Ok!
Why is he so wholesome
USA FOOD YES
wheres jimmmyyyyyyyy????? isn't he seeing this mans hard work of selling water                   😂😂😂
If this man decided to sell bottles of water everyday for one year, he would earn $50,000 in income. That's some insane level of hustle 😂😂😂
i love every day video of this challenge .😄
YOU'RE DOING GREAT!
You would fit in with the kids at my middle school
i'm not tryin to wait another day
How did it go from The Great Depression to The Great Reset
This is the best youtube series ever
Anyone ever think someone might be following him in LA? Is it just me?

I’m a huge fan but just wanted to point out that the math for the money is wrong many times
If Anything this just goes to show how nice and generous people can be.

Smart idea what if you buy money and then when the GREAT RESET happens you will have some money
Bruh
sweet
LETS GO TOMMY!!
This is epic
Buy a plain ticket
If you think about it Memorial Day was 3 days ago and today is June 3rd then that means he started on may 27th and he son his 6th day right now
But money in bank so even if the great reset does happen you still have money
RYAN TAKE THE BIKE TO A PAWNSHOP
Raise money for a cheap car, u can use it to move faster and sleep in it too!!
the "necessities" should include sunscreen and aloe vera! (like don't forget about skin cancer lol)
I am a young investor and I donated 1,000
Ryan dont get a burrito get a burrito bowl and a tortilla and u can save money. I love ur videos. keep on grinding.
These videos are part of my daily lunch breaks now ❤ Go Ryan!!!
PLS GO THRU TENNESEE
GUSY he’s on day 7 right now which is crazy because usually when he posts the first episode he’s done. Great job Ryan keep up the amazing work!
can i get a shoutout?
hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
how did you get chipotle for $6.84????
I LOVE HORSES 🐴🐴🐴🐴🐴🐴🐴🐎🐎🐎🐎🐎🐎🐎🐎
U prolly could get a plane ticket
Ryan makes the best content out there love yah
Even Ryan liked the comment
I don't think that its people in California don't drink soda. I think its that you were trying to charging way too much for a can...
I love the constant thank you so much when he makes a sale
airrack is my dad
Ryan is one of the greatest YouTubers on YouTube  because he is struggling for 30 day straight day to night in the hot sun also starting a fundraiser to feed the poor. Big respect to Ryan and his team👍
Just buy a plane ticket
Ryan are you a Christian?
Imagine he didn’t know how to ride a bike
Omg well done
"We used to ride these babies for miles" Love that Spongebob reference
cant wait for day 30 to see mrbeast's reaction! LETS GO TOMMY!!
I've started to look forward to waking up because I know Ryan going to post a banger.
This is the biggest project you ever made
13:06 wait why does he have... red eyes
I hope he uploads each day individually so we get 30 episodes.
ahh yes, 69k likes, perfectly balanced as all things should be.
This series is great!
8:54 , yes. yes u are.
he could legit just do one more day of selling water and buy a plane ticket to the other side xD
I think it would've been smart to get a ticket for the night and sleep on the bus
😁Ryan is such a nice and genuine guy, he’s awkward yes but that’s what draws people to him.😁
This dude is such a bad cat. He immediately shuts down anyone who says I can't 😤😤😤
"One word: burrito time" 💀
I can't imagine the beard Ryan is gonna grow by the end of the challenge after not shaving for 30 days
11:53 ahahah. i subbed and unsubbed like 20 times yep its not much but its something srry i could,nt donate
Ryan more like bestin 😁😑 never mind that was uhh that was … moving on bro Ryan has the sweetest heart ever or maby I said ever because everyone hates me so they bullie me including my dad
I unsubscribed then resubscribed +1 penny
returning the cooler 100 iQ
Funny how they say 2 dollars is way to much but that’s the normal price where I’m at
What city are you staying in in the UsA
«Ryan i’m Bryan Ryan» -random person walking by
sell drugs
When pennies go extinct in 2023 its gonna be surviving on a nickel.
Bruh Ryan is funny as hell i love his personality 😂
Niggachad
I love these videos!
good morning again
you ate the burrito in 6 seconds  not 2 .1
Ryan your vids are so good
Good vid
I subscribed
The next series you should start with only a penny in New York, and start with only a penny cloths and your camera so you have to buy a phone and everything and your goal should be to make 500 dollars with a certain items on a list you need to buy
Can you say hi Ryan please it would make my day 😊
I'm guy in the background drinking and eating chipotle
Um only 7.29 for 40 waters!?
The thumbnail🤣
I look how much its a raisin in three hours and it was so much
I have a microscope and I zoomed into your facial hair and I found out that your facial hair is made out of the same pixel as in a computer screen
Mate for some reason the website is saying “access denied” and tells that can’t donate,like I want to donate but I live in the UK so for so,e reason it’s saying the owner of the server has banned your ip…which is infact sad cause I can’t  donate.Please fix it…….love ur vids
Ryan did good selling water
Ryan you need to shotgun a diet dr pepper for your penny challenge for a week you got well over 35k on your charity
let`s goo Day 3 new day im waiting for more content
I love that this is a daily series!!
cool
Since I’m quite young the amount of money he has is a hella alot for my age
Respect for doing this
Btw if u were to survive on a penny here in the Philippines makes sure to make your water bottle prices 15 or 20 pesos cause if u were gonna make it 2 dollars that's gonna be too expensive cause 2 dollars here is about 100 pesos
Damn 100 dollars just by selling water!!? That's like 3 weeks worth of minimum wage salary on my country. XD
The dogs in the side car 😊😍
your local water seller, ryan
Ryan I hope u see this but dr.Phil’s grand daughter goes to my school green hill Addison Texas in 6 th grand and I think I’m my sisters class
LETS GO TOMMY!!!!!
4:59 isn't that the beach from GTA 5 it looks similar
Ryan Trajan turned into a wandering trader
For anyone wondering, the buffer is 4 days, Ryan is currently filming his day 7 vlog
The amount of times he said cheers is hilarious
Are those kids on the beach living in Antarctica jeez the must be sweating bc there in jumpers exspacially that kid with his hood up
I have been watching all of ur vids and I'm subscribed and I like every single vid
Prediction now: instead of traveling now he should keep selling water in LA in order to sav enough money to get all the way to the east coast.
good morning in 12:00pm for me
Does anyone know what backpack ryan has on?
Cool
ryan hes bryan ryan
I would donate but I don’t know my mom’s credit card number
Hi this was three hours ago
Your daily upload LITTERALLY makes my day
PLAY OF THE GAME: Ryan:Im gonna upload daily
hi
Nice Vids
I love Ryan vids. Literally the first thing I do when I wake up is watch Ryan Trahan vids!!! LOL LMAO!!! 😂😂😂😂😂😂  PS: It would make my day if you LIKE or COMMENT on Ryan’s vids or this comment
“Ryan i’m Bryan Ryan” 😂
Why is this so entertaining? He is just selling waters. ❤
Man that guy was a scam who didn't give you 20 $
*tries to make it on a single penny *buys the most expensive burrito he can find
YAY A NEW ONE!
I really enjoy these kind of videos from you Ryan. Keep up the great work, love it!
i just started watching you yesterday and your my favorite
LETS GO TOMMY
Ryan and I fit in equally We dont
It looks hard walking in the sand
You gotta do this is new york city bro. See how different people are.
In 13:06 his eyes is so creepy
Reminder to be carefull that selling items like this is ilegal so be carefull not to get caught if your planning on doing this for easy money
Please get sunscreen!
13:07 he hhas red eyes
So I guess this is a series? Halfway through the video I was confused how you started with a penny lol
I am doing a 29 day challenge to remind him to take baby wipe showers during the trip, this is day 2   Also, reccomend me a good chipotle burrito to have
By “The Great Reset”, are you making an Inscryption reference?
I LOVE this dude
Someone should do the 50k for the final day
People care about water more than cola and pepsi. L cola L pepsi
9:58 , thats some strong facts right there
he is in gta 5 map
I can’t wait to see that diamond play button!!!
Get a wallet on day 4
It was seven seconds
You should put the sing on the cooler
c,mon guys we already got to 1/4 a 100,000 lets get to  100,000
not trying to be rude but im 10 turning 11 in 3 days and i have more factual hair
Get a wallet
wearing that backpack must hurt after hours..
I feel good watching your videos Please keep doing
First
Why didn't he just keep the original water cooler?
We love the videos
Here is a tip sell beer itll go down like crazy
You should get beer
i wanted to donate but my dads phone is connected to my tablet
Yuo are besttt
buy a car
I was the guy in the grizzly hat that bought water at 3:48 we took a picture with him too 😁
Twerk
I could turn this idea into a videogame to get more buzz. Character starts out with a penny and has a few shops and options around and each human in the game has things they like and don’t like (such as soda or water)
letsgo third day gang
best youtuber ever
I love this guy
You are probably not going to read this but if you collect empty bottles its good money
Best thing ever to be honest
cheers! The sentence when selling water
Font used for item names: Copperplate Gothic Bold

5:48 kennedy is my last name 💀
In South Africa $110 is actually quite a bit
Get this man to 10 million subscribers before the 30 days are over
My little brother said he's going to start praying for you every night because he's worried about you sleeping in that hammock on the street
Has Ryan bought sunscreen yet??
What’s that thumbnail Ryan?
You should make a cooler sidecar for your bike then selling is like faster
Happy 70th Jubilee to The Queen of England!
wait wha- HE RAISE 336K MEALS IN 3 DAYS!?! he will be able to complete 1 million in like 1 more week at max maybe!?! thats crazy
This series has been very interesting
He's not socially awkward. He's awkwardly social.
Hey its evening in Philippines
Its crazy how a couple months ago ryan was at 2-3 million subs and is now at 7mil. Keep going king
i beg you to change the walking transition music
Do you normally use women's deodorant
Awesome!
The " I am so emo " got me
He’s gonna be coming into Arizona, hopefully he comes to my small town of rio Rico
Ryan's so good with socializing.
At the end of your trip you should pay your phonebill for the month with any extra money that you have. (Since your phone is such a essential part of your trip)
Do buy 1 get 1 free and make it 3 sollars
GG
“One word burrito time” Ryan that was two words

This is so enjoyable to watch!!!!
im suppriesd of how much money you made
God loves u have a great day
4:28 dude started walking in first person
The best series in the history of YouTube. And we're only 3 episodes in so far.
Fact  -  this is a way the poor people can get rich
I don’t mean this in a rude way but Ryan’s social skills are so bad it’s funny! And that’s why he should do this more so his social skills get better!
is that GTA????
If you go to velma ok I'll give you a 20
Why do you always say brother?🤨
Ryan I have a lesson for you remember when you said happy Memorial Day since I have grownup in a military family I have learned it’s not happy Memorial Day your just should be thankful and that is a lesson from CallMeShark
For me day two and now 3 are uploaded in the same day
Best YouTuber
RYAN PLEASE BUY SUNCREAM
I can’t wait for the end of the serious and his inventory is half the vid
why did they steal that beach from GTA ?? Surely they have copyright on it. No ??
Watching these videos makes me so happy and seeing how much money we’ve all raised is amazing! Ryan the stuff you do is also amazing!
Hey
Memorial Day is my birthday!
i love that i will be apart of history lol
5:30  Bros really out here looking like GTA characters
I feel like Ryan would spend some stuff to sell, and get less money than he did then when he didn't spend it.
Literally can’t wait until the next upload
im loving this series
Lol imagine he find Quinn
Loving this series keep it up!
Gta 5 is chef's kiss game they remade the park at around 5:30 perfectly.
Wow
Man the sun is having no mercy on your skin, better get some sunscreen
Man I wish these were longer! I'm on the edge of my seat lol
After seeing the map I just realized. This series can last a long time.
Pls Ryan buy a hat and use sun screen, i cant see you in that weather wearing nothing getting sun burned
First one
Cool :)
$2 for a water is pretty high. Should just be $1
Watching these funny videos make my day
5:31 they look like gang member LMAo
There is 30 dollars in subscribers
Dude the next purchase you need to make is sunscreen
Speed eating burrito that's probably a record
Start selling lemonade at the beach
this series is ryan selling water in la
Very cheap hotels in Tupelo ms 40 dollars a night
You can see ryan is getting better at this penny challenge

I think they say no bc they think the water is warm u need to put 'cold water' instead of just 'water'
Since your coming to North Carolina i really want to try to meet u because I live in NC
hi
Grow a moustache, that would be cool.
Ryan you haven’t gotten a lot of donations because the link lags. Is there a way to apple directly on the video instead of going to a link that just spins for mins?
Loving getting a new vid every day

I cant believe what a amazing guy Ryan is, doing these crazy things while entertaining us and at the same time helping the world become a better place. Thank you Ryan for entertaining me for so long and for being such an AMAZING person!

I have a question is it automatically the reset when you reach 50K or does somebody have to donate it all by themselves?
people in LA are NPC's
Which is better the Mc chicken or the burrito from chipotle
naice vedeo B)))
Ryan Trahan Posting every day!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This looks easy, and it make me want to do it. Maybe I should. I need to touch grass anyways.
You should really get some aloe and sun screen for your inventory  ;) Keep being amazing Ryan!!!! :D

Reminds me when I used to put sand in my sock from the school playground and take it home to put it outside😅
I love the grind, and that i get to watch this everyday :)
Bug pro
Cant wait for tomorrow's video
666,751= 63 DNA in cell to singularity

I kind of love how relatable Ryan is in this series- how he still shows the awkward interactions and failures at selling stuff
If this comment gets 30k likes i will donate 50k
Ryan is making everyone’s Summer better with this series.
Just discovered this series and I love it! Keep it up!!!
I unsubscribed and subscribed again, does that count for my 0,01 penny donation? XD
I love saying 2.1 seconds
i love how much dedication ryan puts in to simply just entertain us and help people

The 20 dollar thing that the guy wants to give Ryan it was most likely a trick so it wasn’t an accident it was a scam
This next episode bouta be lit

Bruh i would give a hundred dollars
big uo MrWhoseTheBoss.
Hello

I’m surprised he got a $6 chipotle burrito
Can you just return a used cooler? I'm curious. Awesome what he is doing man
“Good morning sleepy heads”, is that a stranger things reference? 👀
Jesus died for our sins so that we can go to heaven. He payed our price. Put your trust in Jesus Christ and he will grant you the gift of heaven.

I love these videos!
i love these
E
The plastic is bad for the environment. from the water.(not to be annoying)
love your videos
I wouldnt mind watching all the series in a cinema, man this is so entertaining and joyful
If you go to Louisiana is super hot so you can sell so much water
if he sells water again for $2.00 i think he should also do 2 for $3.00
I can’t wait till he goes to all these different states
ayo are they hiting up the griddy  near 1 min
This is the best, walking up everyday for a Ryan video
so how do you charge youre camera?
I’m looking forward to these every day
please, everybody! If you are rich, PLEASE DO *NOT* donate 50,000 dollars! The GREAT RESET wil just make the series bad. it will be really bad, to see how everything starts again! please please do not donate that many money! it will make the series dumb.
Save your early spot here!
Are you allowing yourself to rent a car
git trippin
Why did you return the cooler in the DAY 2 if you would use it again on Day 3 ? How about Dashboard delivery? You will need a sunblock, this is a necessity.
i love your videos
I love waking up and getting to watch these
Great Series
Horses :)
Dude I went to Venice the day before you =D. Coconut water rocks, so you should sell that! it could help🤑
You are the most genuine YouTuber I have ever seen.
i wonder how long it takes for him to do the math for how much money he has at a certain point
Next challenge I crossed the world with only a penny in a year lol 😂
One of the best series on YouTube by far!
Ryan's really smart with this, he probably bought the water from somewhere faraway from the beach and the people at the beach might be thirsty and obviously who would want to buy like 20 waters a packet. It's really nice to see how Ryan thought through this!
Is Dr Phil ur grandpa now?
I barely got finished seeing the last one. Can't wait to see where this this adventure will lead you!
give the 1 meal I donated by subscribing 10 times to any person named jerome (he cannot be called anything else than jerome)

i like how he proves anything is possible
I love this series
Dude come on don't return the cooler. If anything, sell it. But don't return it after you use it.
Quality content every day for a month Les Go!!
you should save to nuy a plane ticket
We survived watching your video for 30 days
Please buy some sunscreen man, please
I just realized that Ryan does this thing where every time he takes money from someone, he sort of moves his hand up and down slightly
Please get sunscreen
He has showed us it’s possible to live off of a penny without a job
Faith in humanity restored!
Love the series
Ext time go to Chick-fil-A and ask for a pound of ice and it 1:00
Make a day 4 ppppplllllllssssss
Loving the series. In LA I bet sparkling water (La Croix, Waterloo, Perrier etc) would have been a hit.
Wait how is it night in usa in the same time that it’s night here in the uae HUH? Ok I guess and also see you Tommorow!
Everytime you say "The Great Reset", I was laughing 😂
if he sees this, he should tape the sign to his cooler so people see it better
This series is carrying me through me injury recovery ❤️‍🩹
Ryan I have a question if someone donates enough for the great reset where does the money go that you earnt?
Loving this series. Daily uploads are awesome!
tony
10:36 Great practice!!
I love your videos I am a big fan.
You thought that you could just pass this and not say he he has I see you
In my coutry $1 is $200 so $100 is 20,000
Does it have to be a creator or could i send 50k
Quality content. Chef's kiss
You more than double your original amount with the water
“I am so emo rn 😎”
The water plan should only be used at the hots time of the day
Your videos are so good
I wonder what day he's on
Hi
This is so cool
I just got out of bed lol
Returning the cooler is so clutch😂
You should honestly save up for a plane ticket
I sub i wwht my free meall
Ryan daily vloging is so geat!
sand is treacherous
I didn’t think I would ever be impressed by a guy who sold 40 waters.
This guy reminds me of Casey Neistat videos. I like it
What do you do with the rest of the money when the great reset i mean, mgghh *THE* *GREAT* *RESET* commences ?
this man is a literal god.
he always does this XD love his videos
Day 3! Day 3! Come on say it with me

“I’m gonna buy ice, and a sign.” *deja vu*

Bro said good morning sleepyheads and i just wokeup
E

SLAY
Water salesman is where it’s at these days lol
Sub to RYAN and like
Absolute legend 💪
Hey Ryan as long as you were in California if you were to steal $995 worth of stuff they won’t call the cops or stop you because in California they legalized robbing stores under $1000
Sell snacks on the bus!!
Verified side hustle
Majority of us tuned in cos we broke 🤣
Wait how do you use the bathroom?
Hey Ryan how u charge the phone
Great video if you sell water again you should tell people its diet water
next level of gordon ramsay rates bubble gum.
I am liking this series alot and mrwhoseTheboss donated yey
I live TwO HoUrS a  WaY fRoM La I will Buy the Bike
Ryan: I am so emo right now Also Ryan: I am so joyful right now
Who knew that watching a man sell water was so entertaining.

THE GREAT RESET is still funny to me
Broh u r insaneee!!!

I was just in LA 4 days ago… If I saw you there I would of given you 40$. Well I hope you reach your goal. Good Luck!
Hi

Best series on youtube
I love this Series! Netflix should do something like this

nobody: Ryan's burrito:
thank you for doing this ryan
you are so epic!
yahay i love it brooooooooooooooooooo
I love this series you haven’t uploaded a lot now you upload everyday
i might donate 5000 dollars
I don’t know how he does this stuff. I’d give up on the first hour.
Ryan is the king
“You want it for a 1$” “no” then don’t complain about the price lmaoooo especially when san Bernardino had limits
Am I the only one thinking that he didn’t give a verbal thank for the $5000 donaters ?
Nice
Ide gasss
Ryan, everytime you run out of water buy the 7 dollar 40 water bottle pack and keep doing it and eventually you'll make 1,000 cause i did that before to buy a ps5 and i got the ps5
He is so wholesome!
This is actually the best, I will never run out of content for a month!
Go Ryan go good luck buddy!
Bro I have been watching when you had 200k now you got almost 8 million subs great job
Yesir
Another day another amazing video! 😁
Loved the video Ryan, keep up the hard work your editor is amazing for editing all these videos so quickly for us to watch. Your guys are amazing
what do you call a universe baby [open replies for answer]
THE FACIAL HAIR!!!!
Yas sister
actually good content, thank you
E
This guy would be the prime hobo.
This is amazing still watching it i know its gonna be amazing!
Its night for me rn
If you want to read the Gospel, then I will put something like that in my replies, but if you read that then you should still read the complete Gospel. If you read it then like the comment so that more people can see it, and more people have at least one opportunity, because accepting Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior is the most important decision that you will ever make.
Lets go with you all the way man
You can't have no soda and life is good in the same sentence
Congrats on surviving 3 days ima donate 50k rn
Buy a cooler and keep the receipt and then when the great rest happens then you can return it and get 30+ dollars back instantly
Who else wants to sell waters now😂
you should permanently buy the cooler tomorrow to protect it
i think showers are beautiful to😎
I I like how he called me and sleep your head and I woke up at 10:50 in the morning
By now, I think Ryan with how good he is at making money and saving it (proven in his challenges) I would not be surprised if he had more money than Mr. beasr
LETS GOO DAY 3
He should buy some sunscreen
If your looking for a place that’s is cheap go to Missouri
12:26 Ryan has a ring on him
Ryan is just so cool for doing this, I've loved the idea and really appreciate that he's doing this to raise money for charity as well.
Im currently sick and at home. watching ryans videos makes my day better
What's wild to me is that selling water is actually how I started out a while ago. This whole series brings back memories.
Is Ryanarried he has a ring
Dude I love this series it's great what your doing keep it up
Jesus loves you all ✝️❤️
Jesus is comming soon repent from your sins God loves you all ✝️❤️
The timeline is, day 1 is Saturday June 1st, Sunday June 2nd, and Friday June 3rd. So he is on his 7th day of his trip. how do I know this, he said it was Memorial Day in this video.
try selling the bike before you leave !
im start selling water
Super early I love these series
Man using tenent soundtrack
Nice 👍
Ooo I’m so exited to watch this
1:14 goofy ahh griddy
the way he awkwardly laughs is just so funny
Hi Ryan loving the series, it makes me believe any thing is possible until you but your mind to it and the hard work pays off. Have an awesome day 😊
Dude, it's crazy that your doing this. Thank you!
Lets GO Tony
I've taken Flixbus before and he's probably going to Las Vegas or AZ
how are you guys doing the editing traveling
Dude u need to be careful in that sun. You are going to be in big trouble by late 30s. I regret not wearing spf and hats. I have destroyed my skin. Be careful
I WILL DONATE U 50K LMAO
He would have made a lot more money if he just kept the cooler from the other day
Warum bekomme ich bei ihm immer rasierer werbung
People really have 50k to donate
nice
plsssss day 4
This series is dope
Is that the beach from GTA?!?
You should probably get yourself some sunscreen ☀️
I love this journey!!
hey ryan how you doing
I wish I could make that type of money in 3 days🙂
when its friday and he said its memorial day I was like dang how many days is he on now?
Ryan,big man remember : put the ice on THE BOTTOM OF THE COOLER
Who else randomly started watching Ryan and now it's just a everyday thing?
It feels so weird seeing these everyday
I love the consistendness off these videos
RYAN BUY SUNSCREEN 😭😭😭😭😭
I just sub
Go to a pawn shop for the bike!!
Please use sunscreen!!
WERE HALF WAY TO 1 MILLION
Damn LA people seem nice and genuine. I'm not used to seeing that stuff cos I live in a shit city in England.
He went from 1 penny to 10000 pennies in three days. By day six he’s gonna be at 10 million lol
bro this man NEEDS sunblock and aloe vera
Crazy content as always this is lit man < 3 : )
He should switch the title to: "scmming people with a penny"
My mom works for feeding America and she is so excited that u r doing this she is a ceo for a food bank and can’t wait to see how much food u donate
Oh yeah gulp gulp gulp
I'm loving the music on these videos!
Ryan, u should try selling Gatorade and put "Gatorade a good score of electrolytes 2.00"
Nice
nice video!
I have made $2.30 from a penny it was amazing and im still continuing
You're doing am amazing thing!
the dulp dulp dulp got me
that was so funny waking up and first thing ryan says is “good morning sleepy head”😂
Hope you do t keep going
This is probably my favourite thing that you have done because of the daily uploads and entertaining content!
Who is your camera man and what do you feed him
0:48
Can I have some cash?
this may seem like the same 7 days on 1 penny challenge, but it's actually way harder when you think about it, because not only is he needing to buy tickets on buses to go to the next state, but he also needs to leave behind some possessions, as well as meeting new people who he doesn't know what they will do if he makes an offer with them, which makes it a lot more mentally stressful on him.
If I just keep unsubscribing and re-subscribing, then will count as multiple subscriptions? or would i have to subscribe using multiple alternate accounts?
Yiur my idol.
who know that building on the left only true gamer know 8:45
Not dissing love this series just how ate you charging your equipment and your phone
Loving this! You are one of the goats
Good job, Ryan. I'm sure your grandpa is proud.
I love your personality man! Keep spreading love and positive energy 🤍
Hi else wonderers if Ryan is still doing this because it is Memorial Day in the video
at least the pose this time was better than the last one...
Where’s that music from?
I love these so much 💖
Keep up the good work Ryan you are so entertaining
It's about 20,000 or something away from the great reset! Guys we gotta donate like MATCHINES!!
Best videos on the planet
one think i love about this series is seeing how generous people are. Ryan always encounters the sweetest people
I can't believe I now have something to look forward to everyday this is awesome!
Dude, you can bring out 10 vlogs a day, I'll watch them all... Well maybe not all 10, closer to 7
1h late :(
4:25  Hand, hand, hand, hand, HAND.
How do you buy  battery on your camera and your phone
You should buy kool aid mix to sell with the water
I love how he does this series and  actually uploads every single day!!👍🏻
Do we have to be a company or creator to donate 50k?
10:47 that was actually so nice bro
I’ll always know about Quinn
i got to see this 371980 views
Everysay i wait for this series episode! The awkwardness is the funniest thing and just your entertainment. Im si exited for the rest of the episodes!
I'M IN LOVE WITH YOUR SERIES! I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE GONNA UPLOAD EVERY DAY 😍
Underrated.
HAPPY PRIDE EVERYONE
ryan made $65.35 off of selling 40 water bottles
I love his wholesome awkwardness and his just general funniness
Your lucky it's a blue state, they believe in charity there!
e
Theres trains in la that go across multiple states
Good and awesome video like all time Ryan
hi day 3 of june is my sister birthday comment happy birthday! oh yeah your amazing keep it up
Keep up the great work
Btw when the dude gave a ton of money for a ton of cash back he did a short change trick it’s basically fraud
if the earnings stay consistent some person could make a living out of that 🤯
water 2 dollars, pretending to not know if you have change... priceless
When people ask "can I get a water" say no and say just kidding
i feel like is I saw this man saying "gulp gulp gulp" and "Bikers are really thirsty" I would run
I love the videos that u feel like ur on the jerney  with you it’s so fun
Woa Isaiah photo donated 5000
I love how when he has a cooler everyone is very kind and thinking that it’s funny or cute but when he is just selling individual bottles of water everyone is politely turning him down thinking these probably have drugs.
Even when he has to live off a penny he Still takes more showers then a league player
dawg pls get some sunscreen
I want to do this
🙂💜
I'm so ecited to see these 30 days, im so glad you are making these
Ryan: "Another day, another agony."

I know MrWhoseTheBoss and Isaiah  photo the to easy army they are both YouTubers
helooo

Watching Ryan’s videos always gives me a strange sense of satisfaction.
If u go to target checkout and u scan a bag of ramen then put that u have 7 bags, the ramen is free
W
How can you hate this guy
Your a great narrator don’t say your not and I absolutely love your vids keep it up
Y’all not gonna talk about the 2 famous YouTubers that donate?

Wait is this content gonna take 30 videos 🙄

Get sunscreen and try and sell some cheap candy or some doller pop or waters and you could make a lot of money from doing that

I'm from India... This video make me goosebumps.. Coz... Turning 0.1 $ to 100+$ is insane here !... I dunno 'bout there.. How the people took this... Maybe it's small money there.. 🤷‍♂️  Day 3 was just awesome Bruh ⚡💙💫
Amazing
Ryan if it Memorial Day and you said every 50k you restart doesn’t that mean you are already 4 days ahead meaning you are scamming us
Really I like this man so much he puts so much affords and some awkwardness on all of his challanges

Can’t wait for Ryan to get 1,000 dollars in the next episode!
This was absolutely amazing i think this was one of the most entertaining videos I’ve watched in a while, my dude you’re a great person, also to think that you could make such a great profit with just a single penny is absolutely mind blowing, keep it up and don’t give up.
1:58  The price is amazing at that moment :--0
“1 Peter 4:8: Above all, love each other deeply, because love covers over a multitude of sins.”

airrack and ryan need to do a collab soon they both are awesome
What?  Busses usually has extra space for large luggage or bikes. Idk how it works in America but just tell the driver to open up the luggage inventory. In a worst case scenario they might charge u some extra but it is worth it. Do not sell the bike!
just do a buck 50
How was that burrito only $6.84?
This is incredible! Well done for everyone who is working towards this fundraiser… all the donations, editor, camera guy and Ryan! This is awesome!
Gl

Maybe someday, i will be a YouTuber to, and i got my plans, just no realistic motivations to get started. You're great, just for you to know, of youre not aware of this fact already

I was watching the video and I accidentally dropped my phone from excitement and scared my dog 😂 I apologized and he went back to sleep 😂
Insecurity and Realization
i love this series
I mean would you buy water from a stranger with a camera man filming? AND SO EXPENSIVE!
if i lived there i had given u some money bro
You're going to go through Arizona probably as soon as I'm excited because you're going to be a couple miles away from my house and I'm one of your biggest fans
Let's thumps up for efforts ryan puts for fundraising and entertaining us at same time.
Yes I watched others and I watched some match games and 3d day is here
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
You should make a list of the most generous cities at the end of the series
Hey Ryan I love your content and you are super funny so keep up the good work
If you see this your late
Ryan you could probably just save for a plane ticket…
You’d sell more waters in volume if you did 3/$5.
Make sure to combine all these videos into one extremely large video   Nahart Nayr
:)
5:03  I’ve watched to much spider man
Here's an interesting question: Why not save up for a plane ticket?
Imagine getting a heart
damn mans on the grind
Good work man keep up the paste
Good morning 🥱🥱🥱
Day 3 was a crazy one! You made a ton more than I expected! I also can’t wait for MrBeast’s comment on day 30!
;-;
“Good morning sleepy heads” Sounds like something Tohru would say.
Lesson learned do not sell stuff at the skate park because people will just ignore you
I'm waiting for you eventually get robbed
omg yay I know I only sent £2 but 20 meals! that's amazing. I love this cause and fundraiser
plane*
a-hhhhhhhhhh
Ryan at the end you should find a way to calculate the most generous cities and make a list of the top 5 or something
what was the background song play when he end talking plss
you should save your money for a plan ticket that goes to like texas or something
Today is my birthday
This will go down as one of the best YouTube series.
Is anyone going to talk about why that guy was wearing a hoodie on the beach
My favorite series like if you agree

For anyone who thinks he is cheating/lying about this you can notice his beard and moustache slightly growing at the first seconds of the video
Cheers to MrWhoseTheBoss. $5000 is no pocket change.
Hi
You are the best I love your videos
I think some people don’t know him and everyone does not know him thinks he’s a weirdo :(
Question: are these videos recorded yesterday before upload or on the same day?
I am hundred percent sure if someone leave RYAN in the middle of a city with nothing he will be  successful in just 30 days 💯
Lol I watched part 2 1 hour ago I was thinking when the next one coming out and it came out quite fast
I love your content

I think the thing about this guy isn’t that he’s a master negotiator but that he’s such a genuine and beautiful person and that’s what draws people to him
This is my favorite series on YouTube right now. I am hoping that you hit 10M by the end of this series. You deserve it!
Does anyone know the music name at the beginning?

Hi
haven't said this to any YouTuber according to my notice , but  GREAT VIDEO MAN! you showed us that nothing is impossible
I’m loving these videos and the editing but I wish you’d put the amount you receive back on the screen rather than just the total increasing, I can never do the math long enough to see when people overpay and are generous to your cause!! Great progress! Can’t wait to come back and see more tomorrow!! This is the best part of my morning now!
First and second day successful! We ready for the third!!!
It amazes me how nice but also how sometimes rude people can be in california i live here so I've seen some people
Who else is here from Day 1😍
hey man keep up the good work

Ryan is so relatable, he just isn’t like most other people, he doesn’t fit in well. and I respect that. when I saw day 1 I thought about the original penny series.

I have been watching this sense day 1 of the series everyday I’m watching the series everyday you post it and I am exited to see where it goes
here first hour (just saying)
Best videos
6:15
i wonder whats the amount of sunburns he got
Dad comeback, RYAN JUST POSTED ANOTHER BANGER
watched 2 episodes IN ONE DAYYYY
I can wait for more!
I dont know. It feels like i could watch him selling water for hours
I think of Ryan whenever I see a panhandler or someone selling stuff road side. Seeing the grind and how every little decision he makes in these videos can be the difference between a meal and a snack, a hammock or hotel reminds me of the struggle some people go through every day just to get by. But somehow Ryan can make us laugh while educating us and spreading empathy. Amazing content Ryan.
1st hour
This is the first time I actually have to wait for 1 of these challenges
can't wait for the next day adventure
Someone tell this man to get some sunscreen now
Ello
Bruh just used a cooler for an entire day dragging it all over and in the sand and return it in the same day. Seems a little bit much to me.
you should buy first some sunscreen
Bro that thumbnail made me laugh for hell of a time
Amazing series 69420/10
Does subscribing and unsubcribung count as a penny each time?
I cant wait to laugh when all of my friends are trying this. How about we all try this and we all become rich-                                Like if you Will try it!
I have more facial hair than you and I’m nine years old

Good job!!

Next time you sell water you should sell it $1.75 because people would have  one dollar but they wouldn't have 75 cents laying around so it could be 25 cents profit.

THE GREAT RESET
Wsg!
Bro made over $100 selling water💀💀💀
Ryan Trahan is teaming up with Feeding America to help end hunger. No one should go without a meal, yet more than 38 million people in America face hunger. He is spending the next 30 days attempting to cross America starting from $0.01. Together we can help provide much needed meals to our neighbors through the Feeding America network of food banks.
i am going to wache evry vidio of this and loven it so far kepon going see you tamarow

Hey! If end in the St Louis area, on the Illinois side of the river, with cash to burn, check out  Thip's Thai!! (The O'fallon Illinois one) They are some of the best Thai food you will ever get, and the thing I miss the most from living there! I recommend the Pad Eggplant, the Pad See Ew, or the Larb Gai!!!!

Hi
I will be watching this series 5 years later
Can’t he just buy a plane ticket 🤓
Im quite late :|
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman? Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything You say is ricochetin' off of me, and it'll glue to you and I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating 'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated I make elevating music, you make elevator music
Well its actually night for me :(

Water
If the day this was recorded was Memorial Day and this was uploaded 6/3/22 that means he was doing these activities four days ago. So, Ryan could, and most likely is, actually already on the bus at this current moment in time.

One of the best things about dude is that he never takes credit for himself when he achieves something. He always respect us, the audience, and his team, and he is always polite in all of his videos. We congratulate ourselves on this achievement. More to come and everything to come 💞💞!!
Jesus loves you all and died for our sins

Ryan you the king your my favourite YouTuber I watched all your videos
Ayeee im early (17 minutes early)
Man props the the editor
For a second I thought Ryan just got robbed.
Finished the vid
Can't we just take a moment to appreciate how much time and effort that Ryan is putting into these videos so we can have our boredom cured. :)
👍
Imagine if ryan gets a good day and made $1000 and the $50,000 fundraiser just hit damn idk what to expect
Am I here early???
Honestly Ryan would make a good business man selling product around United States, with his motivation, his kind personality, and dedication to make money to travel across the country
11:13 thats actualy kinda cool pose looks like spider man
GOOD MORNING :)
Hello
love the series ryan, keep inspiring!
all the people who payed extra are amazing
Tony sounds very wise
the other 37 dollar  is from taxes
Actual legend of an editor, can we give him a round of applause
ur so funny
9:02 got me good
Yessir
First
27 more days to go...
i unsubbed then subbed so he can donate food
When I saw kool-aid man I thought he was going to sell the water for a $1 and $2 or $1.50 for flavor but it was just gum
You know it’s a good day when Ryan uploads 😁
Just really curious, what do you say to stores if you want to return something? Since Ryan used the cooler, the wheels are obviously dirty already. In my country, you can only return items if they’re untouched :<
This will be better than binging netflix
Man I wish you safe from a criminal
Give every single penny i want to happen the great reset
Love your vids been here for a 3 days
man, what you do is so inspiring!
your great for what you are doing God bless
I was the 45,037th person to view this and the 1.4K comment :)
You might want to stop and think before you say 'Happy Memorial Day'. Memorial day is about remembering the people who passed away in wars. It is s a somber day, yes of course, we do leisurely things during that day, but to say that way - is a little iffy. ;)
DAY 3 LESS GOOO
hi
The thumnail got me confused...
my friend in the 8th grade got more hair on his lip💀
YEAH! 9000st Like!

Bro will upload everyday?!? Wow hats off to you.
im so invested in this
30 days of this guy posting
I love u Ryan
Keep it up! Loving the videos!
bruh
Honestly, it's sad that people have to pay for something that keeps them alive (water). I'm not saying that you're doing something bad, it's a challenge, and also people could buy some water for much cheaper, but I think it's about that whole damn system. You shouldn't be charged for something that you just physically need to stay alive. It should be just free for everyone.
Lez goo
Great Video Ryan . Love Your Videos .
I love this series
Kepp up the daily grind!!!
Hear me out. If nobody does the ⚡️GREAT RESET⚡️ then Ryan will be a millionaire by the end of the series

One of the best things about dude is that he never takes credit for himself when he achieves something. He always respect us, the audience, and his team, and he is always polite in all of his videos. We congratulate ourselves on this achievement. More to come and everything to come 💞💞!!

Never give up Ryan
Whoever’s reading this, I pray that whatever your going through gets better and whatever your struggling with or worrying about is going to be fine and that everyone has a fantastic day! And also whatever is hurting or whatever you are constantly stressing about gets better. May the darks thoughts, the overthinking, the doubt exit your mind right now. May replace confusion. May peace and calmness fill your life.
When Ryan realizes that there not getting rid of Pennie’s it’s going to be comical
first
