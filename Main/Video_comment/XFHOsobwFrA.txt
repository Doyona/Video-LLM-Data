Can you make little nightmares 2 available on mobile? Pls i don't have pc
To everyone now complaining, we all knew the game was bad, but people bought it anyway.  If you remove the directors from the game development and make a story on your own desperatly trying to make more money what do you expected? A good game?! How?
Everything that was shown in the trailer but wasn't was in the game: Low walking alone in Necropolis: 0:04 - 0:18  Alone helping Low inside of Necropolis: 0:18  This cutscene/similar cutscene happening in this location: 0:27  Alone not having to use her wrench to help Low, also the machine is not in the room below the room shown: 0:30  This puzzle: 0:32  This room (i might be wrong tho): 0:35  Alone holding her wrench while crouching and walking in a surface like this: 0:43  The mirror only shows where it will take Low and Alone when Low touches it: 0:47  Low does not turn into stone even though the light is clearly touching him: 0:58  Mirrors in daytime Necropolis and in a different room than the room we got in the game: 1:01  Them standing on the table: 1:09  Conclusion: Alone's wrench was gonna be more useless than it already is, There seemed to be something more important about the mirrors than just teleportation, lore seemed to be different (Low does not know Alone since the start of the game) Low's powers seemed to be more important, The sections where the doll would try to turn you into stone seemed to be a bit more generous (you almost instantly become stone when the light touches you in the game) and nightime Necropolis didn't seem to be a thing.
I was so hyped for this game man
How it the fuck you can ruin part 3 soo bad i mean game is sooo wasted potential i mean heeel you fucked it up totally 😂
You guys ruined the franchise. The game was boring as hell and you even removed the soundtracks that makes the game eerie. This just became a $40 co-op walking simulator game.
❤❤❤ TO LN III!
Eu chorei quando anunciou, e chorei quando lançou...
Worst game in the history of video games, bought for Switch 2 and my girlfriend has Switch 1 and won't let us play. My friends have PS4 and PS5 and she won't let them play. Not only is there no local co-op, and now there's not even cross-gen! I'll throw this game away or go to the store to get a refund! And the best part is that I got Switch online and my friends got PS Plus. For this game, we'll contact PlayStation and Nintendo too.
The piano wasn't in the game
Концовка очень грустная.. [Ending is very sad..]
Se eu fosse colocar uma nota de 0 até 10 eu não colocaria nem o zero de tão ridículo que foi esse jogo.     O custo OK, é um jogo lançamento e a gente entende o preço, porém o que se esperava do jogo (mesmo com historias diferentes em relação ao 1º e o 2º) fosse um game com uma jogabilidade MUITO melhor que os jogos anteriores porque eles melhoraram a cada game, diferente desse que se fosse o primeiro jogo da franquia pra mim estava ok.    Sem contar alguns Bugs, tempo de jogo(muito pouco tempo) e puzzles que fazem com que manchem o jogo 1º e 2º de tão bestas que são, sinto que perdi meu tempo jogando esse jogo, eu realmente estava esperando algo melhor, mas acredito que por conta da saída da tarsier studios teve essa queda de qualidade.   Acredito que a nova desenvolvedora ou o responsável pelo jogo nunca tenha jogado de verdade pois se tivesse jogado teria vergonha do jogo feito. Infelizmente perdi meu dinheiro nesse jogo, não é fácil para uma pessoa CLT comprar um jogo desse porte e pelo menos sentir-se satisfeita, era melhor ter jogado no TIGRE pelo menos eu sentiria alguma emoção, pois no jogo não senti nada  Para aqueles que querem comprar, comprem quando aparecer uma promoção de 90% do valor do jogo, aí sim vale apena!
what kind of sense makes a multiplayer mode without couch-coop??? 🤦🏼‍♂️
0:31 I wish they kept this piano in the full release :(. I feel like the state it's in right now makes it too similar to the piano puzzle in Very Little Nightmares. If they kept this piano it would've made it more unique!
this game should NOT have been 40$
Why is it not a couch co op! I bought it thinking it was ughhh
Update: so fucking peak.
Trailer : 😮😮😮😮  Game : 🤡🤡🤡
Cant lie, this one was extremely underwhelming compared to the fjrst two. I ended up getting a refund in favor of watching my favorite youtuber play it and didnt feel like i missed out on much by the ending
❤❤❤74,000
From what they showed back then, the game looked 60/70% done. I don't believe the extra 2 years was needed solely for optimization and "giving the players a high quality experience"  It's not a bad game, but man, waiting an additional 2 years for what we got.
Don't buy it has No Couch Co-op What a f*cking cash grab man
The only Nightmare is the price
Loved this game :)
Aaaaaand the game is meh....
0:32 where is it? In the upcoming DLC?
i am scary for buy that game trying to play co op local with my wife and not work, i dont know why its so hard to make a co op local, 90% players hate that... We wanna play with friends closely no far away, we wanna create memories.
I've made a refund because it doesn't have local coop on PC, garbage
LN3 made me realise how much I like LN2
So the puzzle at 31 seconds amd following scene was cut from the games release?
Who came here after it relased?
yeah this game suck
Porfavor traiga a los antiguos desarrolladores ag Hhh taiserr porfaaa
40 dollars for 4 hours of gameplay what kind of scamming shit is that screw you guys changing the studio for no goddamn reason
0:34 this part was scrapped💔
0:32 is it just me who noticed this wasn’t in the game?
Release date is 2024 💔💔💔
3 hours btw. I'm not gonna buy this shit ass mid game. The second game was much more enjoyable.
CASEOH PLAYED IT🗣️🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥🔥

Espero gosta desse jogo porém 😢 tiraram o que eu mais gostava no gênero que esse clima sombrio tá muito claro jogo não sei se vou gostar tanto assim 😅
Make a local co-op in Little Nightmares III
Happy 2th birthday of the trailer 🥳🥳
Будет ли кооп на одном пк?
Dioss que juegazo la verdad muy buena saga little nigthmares de los mejores ya estoy ansioso. Por probarlo🔥🔥
Because I have a feeling there's going to be another betrayal between friends (help) 😭
2 years later

La cagada va en la taza bandai 💩💩
What happend to the game its 2025?
Oct 10! 😛
anh chơi little nightmares phần 3 đi ạ
COOP?
I think the broken mirror has something to do with six so are we going to fight six in this game
My switch 2 is ready for this.
In two months ahhhh
I’m so excited I have no one to talk to about this 😭
Cool its Low and alone
I saw this game is finally available on my Xbox One 🤩
What if 6 is the villain?
0:39 THE FUSES FROM THE HOSPITAL I HATED TAHT SO MUCH
AMAZING!!!!!
💯👌
This is not the third part. This is not a sequel. This is not what we expected. Mono and Six are not just characters. They are the soul of this franchise. Without them, it is not Little Nightmares. It is just a game. Bring back Tarsier. Bring back the meaning. Bring back the heart. Before it is too late
I need lore of these new charictars
Vai lançar no dia de São nunca esse caralho é?
Bah, comprei o 2 hj
HOW AM I NOW ONLY FINDING OUT THERES GOING TO BE A THIRD ONE
I cant believe its been so long 😭
When hmm, Its has been 1 years
Weve gotten New Silent Hill Games what about LN3 😢 ?? ❤
2025
Where are our legends? Where's the sixth?(
Hello, when will the mobile version of Little Nightmares 2 be released? Why is it taking so long? But when will it be released, please?
So we not gonna see mono then
Bro pls bring back mono
Wait wait more wait
Will this third installment have a second player? (I mean, will you play with friends or not?)
bramble and little nightmares ( my favorite horror platformers ) somehow reminds me of a game i played in my youth ( Heart of Darkness on Ps1 ) a cinematic horror platformer!
Miawaug "ONE OF THE BEST" World premiere Winner Is Little Nightmares 3" 👏👏😍☝️✨
Congratulations Little Nightmares 3 ( Bandai Namco Entertainment )  greetings from Indonesia, Number one ☝️🇱🇷🇮🇩 Total: 9/10 ✅🟢
Pq
Yes
hold up hold up in this series we meet mono baggie rn? or just the betrayer six sasha bro?
🤫
No couch co-op was the biggest mistake these creators could’ve made.  HUGE L.
2025?
I sincerely don't understand why Tarsier studio left the series.   This game looks very loyal to the original games, and at the same time Tarsier studio is developing a different ip which looks JUST LIKE LITTLE NIGHTMARES  I don't understand
I can't wait
Tu peux faire little nigthmare 3 stppp
Лучшая игра
so hyped
What Is The Date The litterae Nígermares
Lets bloody hope that none of these two get betrayed by one another.
Who’s still waiting in 2025?
This is too perfect
Wow
Anyone else notice the inspiration from "9"????
Le seul jeu que j’attend avec impatience.
Love how they lied
Does anyone know?
0:32
So, for Nintendo Switch 1, right?...
WHERE'S  BAGGY!!!!
Please make it mobile
Why the song little nightmares is differnt little
How do we get to play the Demo or Beta? I would love to!
Bring he back pls
Why six why!
Pls bring he back
Pls bring he back I am
Pls god bring he back mono I am very saddened
Idk why, but for me the music goes HARD in this trailer. Especially near the end.
Ojalá saque el cuatro
Ojalá aparezca algo de six al final
cant wait
Someone call Cory 📞📞
Como esperas hacer un little nightmares, sin la esencia de little nightmares??
Когда выйдет???
i wonder if that ending shot is the signal tower being taken down
Pls on phone 😢😢
ive been waiting for so long i now have a girlfriend and 200 more hours into little nightmares 2
LN 1: Yellow  LN 2: Blue LN 3: Orange
Please give me information whether this game has been released or not yet?
Hopefully these two do not have the same fate as the originals
Kinda sad Six and Mono are gone but so glad I have a new game to play! Looks great!
What if Mono is the Finall Boss in this game?
Please release little nightmares 2 on mobile device ❤
Ça devient mon laa...😢
❤❤❤who lovw mono?
I just realized that I grew up playing their games. When I first got interested in LN, I was 7 years old, and now I'm almost 16
pls put physical copy
I’m sorry but this looks like Childs play compared to the reanimal trailer u can tell ln3 is made by different developers
I love how the third have a bit more hopeful aura and the new characters looks so sick
The first game was about gluttony. The second was about being absorbed in media. Wonder what the third one will be.
It comes out in 2025
0:33 the return of the ship passengers from the first game 🤯⁉
Alguém esperança em 2025?
Release Date: DECEMBER 31ST 2025?! WTF!? Just say 2026 & while ur @ it, push it back to the last day of 26. Fu¢|{ this game! IDC anymore. 😚my💸. Not buying it.
BUT MY COUPLE MONIX???!! ( MONO X SIX )
I'm pretty excited for the upcoming comic, "Little Nightmares: Descent Into Nowhere", but do you know what'd be a really cool piece of Little Nightmares literature...? A Little Nightmares SURVIVAL GUIDE/BESTIARY! Just think about it, a detailed, beautiful, and creepy encyclopedia all about The Nowhere, it's Residents, and many of the places we've seen so far! It could have detailed and slightly cryptic descriptions about the place and Resident (But not say too, too much, just to add the mystery), and it could be separated in different sections or chapters. Like, one about The Maw, another about The Pale City, another about The Nest, and another about The Spiral! (They could do a section about the stuff from "The Sounds of Nightmares", I dunno, depends on how big they'd want it to be). And as for the art, they could probably use some of the concept art for the actual games, or maybe they could use completely new art but with a similar style! There can be anatomy charts that'd kinda delve into the strange bodily proportions and their abilities (like The Teacher's long neck) , have survival tips on how to evade or possibly defeat one of them, some size comparison charts on how big they compared to a normal person, and maybe they could explain SOME of the lore about each one, but again, not TOO MUCH, just to keep the mystery feel to it. It could explain some stuff about the children (like Six, Mono, or RK) but I feel that it'd be focused more on the Residents and The Nowhere itself. Again, depends on what they'd do. If they actually make something like that, then I'd be all like "SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!'
So it's mirrors this time, they never disappoint with their ideas and I can't wait. Everything in the little nightmares universe is awesome!
I Love Mono Character ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
If Six Not Coming Then This Game Gona Flop We Need Six.. And I Don't Think So Mono Was Coming... ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
My idea is that these new characters are from a dimension like sixes and monos and at the end they will help mono and themselves to leave this corrupted dimension 😂😂😂
Perfect,but where is Six?😢
geil
For me im thing each game is basically a origin to each character leading up to sum at this point
when.?
I love this game bcs of musics
A year since this trailer was posted. Combined with 2024 at the end, they're behind on their promise.
0:56 in this part where the girl comes I think is the first chef's daughter
I DONT WANT 2 NEW CHARACTERS 😭😭😭😭😭😭but cool :3 I miss mono and  six together :(...
1 year has passed, no release date, has just dropped a new trailer 3 months ago but still no release date I hope we dont get another silksong incident again
I like how, in comparison to the previous games, this game has a feeling of "this time we're going to do it right". At least it does from my perspective
My little six, where are you ?
Wheres mono and six?
Háganle una serie, please!
I think Six and Mono may appear in this game, maybe not as playable characters but I still think they will have some correlation story-wise
SOOOOOOO COOOOOOL PLS FASTER IT"S VERY SUPERRRRR COLLLL
After a year we still don't have a release date yet, soo sad
What month is the game coming
Please 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 please 🥺🥺🥺 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺 little nightmare 2 on Android
que paso con six?
i wish this game is multiplayer
❤I can't wait! ❤
Mano esse jogo vai mudar a história de 2025 tô louco pra ver o jazzghost jogando ele 😊

We might not be getting Little Nightmare 3 before GTA 6
We might not be getting Little Nightmare 3 before GTA 6
IM SO EXITED FOR THIS GAME MAN, I LOVE LITTLE NIGHTMARES, CRAZY
We need tarsier back😞
Tão anciosaaa
This doesn't seem like it would add to the lore. I hope it does
it's 2025 where's the game😡
2025 год уже наступил где она
AYYYEEE IT FINALLY hit 1MIL VIEWS!!
Reanimal looks way better
Low and Alone are besties for sure

Cool 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Juega german pueden contactarlo para que lo juegue 🎉
i was 13 when i played the first game for the first time. can’t wait for this one to come out🩷
MANO EU TO MUITO ANSIOSO PRA  LANSA
When is this gonna come is 2024 already
:(
I wonder if we’ll see six anywhere
Where is six? Mono? IM CRYINGGGG 😭
THE FANDOM. WE HAVE REAWAKENED.
I was never a fan of horror games like that but when i started little nightmares 1 in 2019. It become my favorite game abd now a third game. Its gonna be so fun to play
Throw out 6 years old no I was into it so much that I loved it but now after hearing this when I'm 13 holy s*** man my life holy s***
It got delayed 2025
"At what point are you hyped about LN3?" Me : Hell fucking yeah
😢я думал будет похоже на старые Литл найтмерсы кста там другие разрабы😢
little lunchlys
Cant wait for the new bosses👀
I loveee the doll
I hope Ruth is still alive!
HEY YOU STOP READING THROUGH THE COMMENTS THEY JUST ANNOUNCED A NEW TRAILER FOR THIS MONTH ON THE 30TH
Where’s my dynamic two…
Atleast make creepy Monsters that baby looks cute
It's just a beautiful master piece, love all the previous game, I can't wait to play this one
Now there's a giant baby doll threat?!
I feel like they could have given us a better trailer. The OG devs of little nightmares gave us a perfect trailer for Reanimal, and it showcased a scarier environment.   This just seems a bit boring, and the baby doll monster seems out of place for little nightmares. Ill still try the game, but im not expecting much from this trailer & their gameplay reveal which didn't show much of anything other than puzzle solving. So far its a lot less intense than reanimal
I cant wait
While it’s 100% sad not to have Mono or Six in the picture anymore, I absolutely love how this is looking and it probably will deliver its purpose, to be straight out of a nightmare. And true, the aesthetic also changed. But it also looks really good! But will I miss Mono and Six? Yep.
If there’s little nightmares four continue six’s story
Save Mono!
2024 her
Hopefully one of them isn’t a backstabbing lil rat 💀
I wonder, because Mono and Six were named after numbers, could it be possible these two seemingly “new” characters are also other numbers? I wonder how it all ties it with the first two games. So excited. Looks awesome!
I love the new aesthetic in this game. It has a much more Halloweeny and folklore-esque vibe. It might be the warmer colors, or the crow mask one of the protagonists is wearing. I really like how it looks.
0:50 Six will comeback soon..
It looks very easy
Something tells me this world is what was created by Mono and Six as the main keepers of the timeline.
Hope these two break the cycle
2025🤬🤬🤬🤬
No way!
This child with the plague doctor mask. Does he have anything to do with the North Wind?
It looks different from the first ones, I am concerned that it is from another studio
IM GONNA PRE ORDER IT WITH MY BIRTHDAY MONEY
Just a thing to say, if they don’t add an A.I. friend for single player mode, we need a mod for it.
unexpected to come out but... rip six and mono
I hope they fix the controls, camera, and bugs in the game. It was gamebreaking in II.
That broken mirror looked familiar...
that ost is sick.
Im pretty sure this game shows things before Little Nightmares II
первый русский
There are only 3 game series I wish to see continued: Dishonored 3, Little Nightmares 3, and Inside 2.  One down, possibly one more to go (R.I.P., Dishonored series!)
If this is the last game in the frsnchise, i need it to have a happy ending, with these 2 finally breaking the cycle of abuse and not losing their innocence in this world where you become so easily corrupted
what is the connection between littlen2 littlen3 ?
Little Nightmares is back!
YO WERE IS SASHA AND BAGGY!?!
I can’t wait to see the game I really liked the first two games no joke I’m addicted to little nightmares but can you please post the next trailer I don’t mean to rush but I just really wanna see when it’s gonna come out this year and see more about those game😅😃🎉
En tant que fan de la licence j'aimerais vous dire est-ce que une personne ici en as vraiment marre d'attendre parce que moi j'attends ce jeu avec impatience et j'en ai vraiment marre je suis vraiment giga hyper et on n'a pas eu plus d'infos mais en tout cas ce qui est sûr c'est que j'ai vraiment hâte et s'il vous plaît je vous en supplie je vous en conjure sortez un nouveau trailer je veux en savoir plus merci Bandai Namco
Ln3 2024:👍👍😀 Ln3 2025:🙅🙅😕😒
Please tell us When Little Nightmares 2 come to mobile 🙏🙏❤️❤️❤️❤️
I’m. Bàčķ
I fainted after seeing this
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️
Is it a two player game ? 😊 i wanna play with my friend
can't wait! Thank you!
I WANT MY LN97!!!!🫴
Idk about the giant baby, I’m not freaked out by it like other little nightmares creatures. Am I the only one kinda disappointed?
Even if its not Mono and Six I hope the lore will continue
Will this one break my heart as you guys did in lil nightmares 2? :(
Nice trailer can't wait for the new game 😅
I've been obsessed with the game series since its release, seriously cannot wait for this one to come out!
И когда оно выйдет?
Why is the character from Little Nightmares 1 called sixth? Because she ate one of the 6 dwarves. At the end, when she climbed the stairs from below, it was no longer 6 dwarves looking at her, but 5  (She ate the sixth gnome, so she is the sixth)
It better come in the 1st of Jan 2025
э черты нерусские, когда выход игры
I really hope this one leads back to the other games. You gave me two games with amazing characters so I just hope they are included in some way. If it has nothing to do with little nightmares 1 and 2 why name it little nightmares 3? Could easily name it like little nightmares lost dreams or something.
It has been delayed to 2025!! You know what that means? It means this Video is Ancient. Anyways I'm both happy and sad at the same time idk how that possible
"Shadows hide more than the absence of light"
this gives that 2000s movie "9", the best kind of creepy
IM SO HYPED
bandai please make my dream of playing naruto ninja 5 on the ps2 on the new consoles come true, you made my childhood wonderful with that's all I asked for
QUE MI8ERDAS HACEN QUE NO PUBLICAN DEL JUEGO QUE NO PUBLICAN NADA HACE 266 DIAS PD: los amo, los quiero mucho 💖💖
Here is the Full game in one video of first two parts 4K Quality  https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8ulNDDosWCDAnlRMISGlXMfYiz_fzk-i&si=mYNdLkMtZJKYc8xW
Some people are wondering where mono and six are, theyve already had their arcs the symbolism or six being the woman at the end of little nightmares 1 and mono being confirmed thinn man it pretty much ends those characters plots
Is it still indefinitely delayed? I really love these games and was so hyped that a 3rd was being made. I really hope a miracle happens and it honestly drops this year. If not, Lemme win the lottery real quick and help out. I NEED this game lol
Dear developers! I'm a fan of your Little Nightmares games and have played the first and second parts. I make music, and I created a soundtrack in the game setting! I would really like to be noticed and maybe add my soundtrack to the game! Thank you for your attention!
Let's hope one doesn't betray the other like last time
No no… this can’t be it!!  Mono and six have to come back
Vas caer six
This setting feels a lot like the movie " #9 ", very hyped for LN3!!!
Litle nightmares are the best games ever made för Nintenso Switch/PC.  PLEASE NEVER STOP MAKING THIS SERIE OF GAMES!!! I need them in my life !!!
I wonder if there will be a game where the story of Mono and Six continues
No more six and mono? 😢😢😢
We can see the lady's silhouette in the mirror 1:04
C’est quand le nouveau trailer
Anyone know little nightmare 2 when Android/ i phone version come 😢 which year
On peut voir la silhouette de la dame du premier opus 1:04
New trailer tomorrow
Can we get a glimpse of the main villain please? 🥺
Come on no six I want to see her suffer
I wonder if I'm the only person who has noticed that the 3rd game or movie of many popular franchises always takes place in a desert or in some place with yellowish and reddish colors.
please allow play with a friend locally
8 months now
The first two were great. Let's see if they keep up the good work.
it's multiplayer
Can't wait...😱😱😱
Where did Tarsier Studios go?
I am soo excited for this! Even though I probably will never be able to play it.
Ill play this, but generally things are not as scary as they could be if you were alone.
I can't believe it, Little Nightmares is my favorite game and I just found out that the third installment is coming out.
Im i dreaming or did that monster coming from the pipe had like 8 hands?
I’m so excited like imagine what the experience is gonna be like.   And is there gonna be a dlc pls answer Bandai namco pls
It would’ve been better if Mona was there, but it’s all right. Either way mono’s duma$$can’t even do anything
Ok so by the looks of the trailers i think the monsters/bosses/enemies are gonna be based of off these too kid`s childhood fears like bugs/clowns/dolls/ect and the "necropolis" mite be a area were these 2 kids have too face their childhood fears inorder to escape the necropolis.
omg!! why am i now just seeing this?!
I love LN so I have NO idea how I've missed this?! A little worried about a 3rd title especially from a different studio... but I'm glad I didnt find out sooner so I won't have to wait as long lmao
WE WANT A UPDATE OR SOMETHING, ANYTHING
just got goosebumps
I'm sure this part will be as good as the previous ones. Thank you so much for the third part of my favorite series
For some reason everytime I think of little nightmares, I get nostalgia and I am still just a kid and it came out in 2017 and I love that game and I can not wait for this to come out.
Little nightmares 3 is a continuation of Little nightmares 4 in the future. If you see the beginning of demo you'll understand what I meant. LN 1,2 are a story and LN 3,4 are a new story. Thank you BANDAI NAMCO for this masterpiece 👏💯
When? 2024 when???
Their names are low and alone
sus
This will be my favorite game of 2024.
dead game
DROP THE GAME!!!
If the second game was about before the first, this one, which is the third, will really be a continuation of what the main story was or it will be another previous installment but telling the story of another Character that has already come out before?
cant waitttttttttttt
I think it's going to come out August
1:06 in the mirror... SIX?!
I wish there would be hints for mono and six
I'm glad I only saw this trailer a couple weeks ago. That'll make the wait much less excruciating 😅
* hunter has joined the chat *
It is already 2024
2024
Lets ggggggooooooo
HELL YEAH
Is it going to come out on March the 3rd
Is 2024 rewriting we're waiting for it to come out like I'm a biggest fan I'm a big fan
OH MY GOD
la fete forene et vraiment cool
Il sortira quand😱😱👌🏻
It better be as dark, creepy and mysterious as the previous two!
I hope its gonna be 10 times longer than the second one and i hope they never stop making new ones cause its my fav!
peak game.
please make as many of those tiny little passages and secret rooms! this is the best game ever😭❤
Little nightmares has gone downhill ever since the ending of The second game
When it’s coming out in Oktober its just perfekt joker 2 coming to many new games and series this year
I only got into Little Nightmares around about July 2023 and ever since I have been obsessed. This story is incredibly well written, it's a story which you ever find once. I've played The first, second game and the dlc, (I'm also looking forward to possibly getting very little nightmares) listened to the whole of The sounds of nightmares, Read/watched all the Digital comics and seen some panels of the older comics and am so excited for this game and the books to come out soon, and hopefully it gets much more recognition this time around!
k k...but...WHERE THE **** ARE MONO AND SIX??
I am excited for this but as others have said, it doesn't seem as creepy as the first two installs.  The fact that it won't have couch coop will be a deal breaker for me though.  Was wanting to play this with my son....
I can’t wait!! Absolutely love this game. I beat the first two, I know part 3 will not disappoint 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I hope it comes out during Halloween
Does it have a date to it
That baby thing is straight outta Arkham Asylum 💀
All of these comments are talking about mono and six, what about seven? ik he died but he's just forgotten about.
I can't wait for this game to come out ❤❤❤
Would have been cool to have kept the original characters and kinda told a story of their journey..
I can’t wait for this 😍😍😍😍 one of the best game in my life
O loco
i can't wait even tho i still havn't finished little nightmares 2
I love that game 🫶🏻
Let's hope this new dynamic duo doesn't end in betrayal. But knowing Little Nightmares, there is no such thing as a true happy ending.
Pls add little nightmares 2 on mobile.😢 And, The trailer looks fine and spooky.
I CANT WAIT
Bandai, will this game be crossplay or not? I would like to play this with my friend but im on PC and he's on PlayStation.
Please have a bad ending
WHEN IS THE ACTUAL DATE, TELL ME
There was something I definitely didn't miss  In the monster baby scene when he is trying to turn low and alone to statues there was a statue In that background that looked like a human not a monster or kid it was a normal looking adult that is not a monster could it be. even abused adults or teenagers go into the nowhere as normal ppl??
but when is coming out the game?
I want to see mono and six back in game😢😢😢😢
I WANT TO SEE MONO AND SIX IN CHAPTER 3 PLEASE-
EDDIE NEEDS TO SEE THIS!!! @Sauceddie🤯
Doesn’t have the same vibe, and not made by the same people. I’m concerned.
release date ?
Man i love bandai namco
I just sent the trailer to my dad, this is so cool
I’m getting steam punk vibes from this games trailer I luv 🤩👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
I’m trying not to be skeptical, but supermassive games tends to lean fully into horror tropes in all their games rather than trying to be original. I’m not sure this is the developer I would have entrusted Little Nightmares 3 with. I’ll still play it and try to judge it with an open mind though.
Omggg qué hermoso ooo ay que emoción 😭😭😭😭, ya jugué el primero por primera vez y ya saldrá el 3 :DDD
ion wanna be racist, but.......
Hello folks, pleaase put local coop on this game. We have been playing the previous titles with my gf and were so exited to play this one in coop. The community will thank you (and pay you) <3
I just re-watched the whole little nightmare game again! I can say im absolutely excited 🔥
we really need six back
NO ONE TOLD ME THERE WAS A LITTLE NIGHTMARES 3???
Ive always wanted them to make a game where you could play with a friend this whole time ive been doing mortal commbat mods and making it all the players so I could play with a friend with little nightmares mods thank you bandai
I know Mono and Six is probably grown in this game but i wonder if they would meet or if they become the final boss
#steelorse
if this is how LN3 looks like LN4 gon look crazy
THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE LITTLE NIGHTMARES 3 OH MY GOD I'M SO EXCITED ABOUT THIS!!!
Including hallucinations.
Those two starting the loop in LN2 , i think
WHY DIDN'T I SEE THIS SOONER!? I honestly can't wait for this, this looks amazing
Something about the misic that makes it very sad especially at :54 to 1:00
non vedo l’ora che escaaa😍😍
Every single little nightmare game even from the demo when mono ate “the runaway” protagonist. Has linked to one another. Not saying that this isn’t an entirely new group unrelated whatsoever to the previous characters. But… The fact that there’s a mirror as it’s attention grabber to me- symbolizes some part of “the lady” from little nightmares 1. I can be wrong but this is just a prediction.
Je suis tellement heureux ouiii
In which month
little nightmares 3 before gta 6
How am I just now hearing about this??? Little nightmare is by far my favorite game. I’m kinda sad to see mono and six gone, but nonetheless I’m excited to play as these new characters.
Please release India in Android
Looks like it's co op?
Six will be a Villan, def, These two new characters are my favorites already
I feel like I'll like these characters more than six and mono, the names after numbers seems kinda strange to me, i feel like there might be a reason for it, and these two will also have numbered names
Bruh dis better follow the story
If it will be duo only and no sole, then it will be pain for me. I have no one to play with :'(
2024 is coming🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
متا ينزل الجزء هاذا
Not impressed!First two trailer was way better!
WE NEED CORYXKENSHIN ON THIS
HAPPY DAY!!!!
Im so glad it's on xbox one 😅 Keep up the amazing work I'm super excited for this one🎉
one of the monster are going to be garbage monster mark my words
Wow That's mirror monster from little nightmares comic that's awesome
NO WAY BRO is this real!!
i'm so excited!! i loved the first two games <3
Who thinks six is final boss
I was ECSTATIC to learn this would be released in 2024. I assumed it would be the beginning of 2024 or hell even March but when I got on Amazon to pre order the game it’s showing that it won’t be released until DECEMBER 31st 2024 which is literally more than 1 YEAR away! OMG PLEASE tell me this is not true!!!!
бля что за фигня с главными героями, вы че натворили. Это ужас. Мы из сурового мира переместились в сказку.
I LIKE THE...story i_i think i CANT WAIT
LETS GOOOOO
no way jose
😮😮😮😮😮 это правда ??? Бля моя любимая играааа сука 3 чясть еееебать
I cant wait for the gaming beaver anyone else watch his videos if no pls go and see you will love him so much
I hope that mono and six get some sort of cameo
The game I am dying to get more than any other next year. Its penetratingly eerie vibes and mesmerizingly colossal Carrollesque characters thumping around to get a hold of your tiny ass is a fucking cool nail-biter. I want this franchise to last for years, really.
WHY DID I NOT SEE THIS SOONER?! IM SO EXCITED
Relase date?
Guys im calling it now! This games main “fear” will be the fear of the dark! First game was being eaten/hungry, second was being watched/alone, now its becoming darkness/dead. (all are childhood fears)  In LN1 you used a lighter, LN2 you used a flashlight, and in 3 so far theres no tool to see in the dark. Whats also interesting....a mirror cant be used in the dark and the ominous cloud in the trailer....DARKNESS. Dark and Death are major components of the past games but i think Six, with her dark, mirrored form and Mono with with his glirched remains both hint a larger theme that can be fully explored in 3.
I hope six will come out in the game
What day is it going to release?
Yeeees!!!!
I've always loved little nightmares, six and mono are like legit a huge part of my childhood, and I'm so excited for this new game
This one looks more like the movie 9 than either of the first 2
My heart is broken by the fact that Mono and Six's story just wasn't meant to have a good ending and that we are not going into the direction of something that connects with their story... but when i saw the massive and dark landfill / junkyard with the two new kids holding hands before seeing the title of the game i thought: "TAKE. MY. MONEY"!
Gostei do trailer muito bom porem coisas a mellhorar
Let me guess, the kid with the wrench will grow in size to become the giant doll?
Будет эпично 😮
The only thing I can think of when seeing that is the ladies broken mirror from little nightmares I
Favorite horror game
I can't wait, never, never, ever. I wait every day for hours, minutes and seconds until the day the game is released.
I whas so so so sad about tarsier leaving little nightmares behind and i'm still sad because i just wanted more of them but!! This LN looks so cool to and i trust you guys i will always be sad about tarsier but you guys can do this
i like to play little nightmares every night before i go to sleep
LITTLE NIGHTMARES 3 IS REAL LET'S GOOOOOO (YOU DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH I LOVE THE WHOLE LITTLE NIGHTMARES THING😭😭😭💥)
i remember developers said they didnt wanna do another sequel after II, but i aint complaining
I played 1 and 2, enjoyed them with all the mystery and eerie/creepy vibes, very well animated and the artwork is astonishing. Don't really understand the exact meaning being conveyed but love trying to pass each stage finding clues, then get more puzzled by the ending. Thanks to the free game "Inside" which led me to find this unique genre of puzzle/horror games. This is the best game series I've played on PS4, nothing tops it.
Coryxkenshin better be coming back to play this
Man, I love Little Nightmares.
Lows Ability is similar to Monos Power to tune in with the transmission Lows Ability Allows him to travel through different realities and in order for him to do that he goes through a mirror and monos Power only lets him travel through different Televisions and going at a random place I think Lows ability is cooler then Monos.
I love this! But i still hope maybe someday for a sequel of little nightmares 2 with both mono and six. That would be cool ngl
This seems like it takes place after 2 but before 1, I can't wait to see how they expand the lore of this game.
Ok, this is more of a personal theory, but i think Low and Mono might actually be connected. They both wear cape and masks. whey have the same movement paterns and can use weapons. Mono can use TV screens as portals, while Low travels through mirrors. And at the end, while Little nightmares text appears, they stand on the left side. Just a theory, ok?
A note for the marketing team you should really use the two kids as the negative space for the III
little nightmares is cool but they need to work the realness/smoothness of their animations and controls, it always felt like a clunky game to me with too many controls for it to be a good Limbo/Inside clone, and this trailer shows more of the same jittery unnatural motion to the characters, though i love the story concept and visuals and artistic aspect the mechanics of the actual game need to be more finely tuned and smoothed out for it to feel as immersive as what it was inspired by
I love the ending of the trailer, how you guys did another version of The Six Theme. It sounds like Little Nightmares II  Six Theme but slower
Little Nightmares IV
Little Nightmares III
Wait Will The Girl Do The SameThing As Six? Or The Boy Will Do The SameThing   *Will They Comeback?* *Will Mono And Six Be Sight Fighting?* *Could Mono Be The Next Enemy?* *Will Six Protect Them?* *Will Six Say Sorry To Mono?* *Will The Signal Tower Be Destroyed?* *Will Mono Take Hes Revenge?* *Or Mono Could Have Already Hang Herself When Six Saw A Hanging Man?* *Namcom I Had So Many Question*
how the hell did i just find out about this now?!
oh holy hot damn omg omg omg
Almost got a stroke caused by awesomenes!!!!
i just hope that one of them without the mask is actualy Six. i just really love Six, she is powerfull, fearless and intelligent. and when playing as mono it felt like you where the useless side-kick from six. i liked the story. but at least it had six included. that Yellow raincoat was iconic :(
Where is my mono and six :(
I’m so thrilled I keep coming back just to relive my excitement
Music for the trailer is a right banger i played all of little nightmares games and the music is one of the reasons i keep coming back to it.  The game seams to have gone for the movie "9" vibe which i loved as a kid but also terrified me.... As soon as i heard there was gonna be a new LM game i instantly wanted to buy without knowing anything now seeing this 2024 cant get here soon enough
اووو مايي قاتتتتتت متحمسسسس مرههههه
Это да
#sev
It seems this game was "wokenized"
congrats on hitting 750k
LITTLE NIGHTMARES 3!!!!😊
No Six? 😢
It looks good just please dont mess it up ;-; other game companys sadden me when there's no love put into their game and you really have a good thing going with this series. Looks amazing so far please don't let us down.
Hyped! Bock! Angriff!!! 😊
Who ever made the music is a genius
if this joint is multiplayer... Cory HAS to play with dashie
Its so coool❤❤❤ im severly waiting but i don't know as a ship of mono and six im still waiting for a complete full stop to that one.... Forgive me if u are hater of six.. 😢 I loved them...
chapter 3
Will these new heroes break the cycle?!
I cannot wait for little nightmares 3!!!!
Naah somehow connect it to Mono and Six, I don't really want a reboot or just a new story :(
Emmmm 🎉
Little nightmares serie tv? When?
Can you please add boss fight’s
This is awesome
Will this be coming to GOG like the previous 2?
Hopefully not PAL only.
OMG I’m so effing excited!!!!!!
https://youtu.be/czTI8mddtEI?si=Y6V4PmMyxwHa6uEE
ITS REALLLLL
🙌🥳🤯
0:11, 0:33
I don’t think I’ve been this excited for a game ever.
Look at that, Valve, it can be done!
i think they'll pop up again within lore. But the only thing is if we see them again, we'll know Mono as tall man and Six will be the creepy woman.
Thank you so much for not letting us down and giving us another game. I fully trust this will be like the first two if not better and I am ready. But one thing can you make it longer then 4 hours please😂 I wanna play for longer
THERE ARE FINALLY BLACK PEOPLE🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
Please tell me that six and mono are out of the picture. Please tell me they all meet up in a game
viva! #LIAM #Phiga
Please….. no more flashlight mechanics. Please 🙏🙏
Can’t wait to play this with my girlfriend. I’m excited ❤
Can’t wait to play this with my girlfriend. I’m excited ❤
Hope theres side quests/missions in it
despite six and mono now being out of the picture, the little reference to six’s music box and the end is heartwarming and almost bittersweet
a new chapter in little nightmares
Wow wow and wow can't wait to play it
The passion in this series and the community is truly remarkable and admirable. I cannot wait to face my childhood fears again, so glad this series is still going :)
this will ALWAYS be my favorite horror game
Little Nightmares 3 Maybe Go Out 2024
when will bandi Namco make a an another trailer
i wish it should support for my 4 gbrsm pc or 8 gb ram laptop without graphics card ,i5 proccesor
I really hope they tie this one into the last 2 games in some way. I wouldn't mind if it was fully away from the last two games, but i would love if they tied it all together by maybe making Six the boss of this game maybe, or maybe even just hints to mono and six, y'know? Just have it all be connected somehow
To this day i will always miss the Runaway kid. And i hope one day we can see Mono again  ￼.
Pinche trailer todo hermoso, me despeina los pelos de los webos de lo poderoso que está
I hope six is involved in this one
I already expected that there would be no Mono. His story already wrapped up with LN2. I'm sure tho that Six is already an antagonist/villain. Wonder if she will appear here
Where's Six?
Hope theres side missions
1:05 Wondering if The Lady will tie in to the story since mirrors are featured in the game, especially since the mirror is cracked.  Also, the official poster shows them standing within a hoop. Does that mean that they’re part of the same loop as Mono and Six?
my theory, does Six have something to do with the spiral or something like that? seeing with so many kid things around like the factory with lollipops, an amusment park, a gaint baby, seeing some play things even in the poster, the mirror and black mist. what do you all think?
Oh my god..
I HOPE DANTDM PLAYS THIS!!
Please don't do what other developers have done lately and release a crap game full of bugs. Take as much time as you need. I want the best out of this, just like 1 and 2.
That big baby is creeping me out 💀
Can’t wait and please do not disappoint
HYPE
I do wish to see mono again.
Love this game. LN2 is most favourite. I dont like the colours in LN3. Hope its more like LN2
The emphasis on mirrors is making me wonder, will the mirror demon play a role in this?
f i r e
When?
Love little nightmares. The main theme for little nightmares 2 drives my daughter crazy she loves it, super hyped, we beat 1+DLC & 2 super fun. Can't wait for part 3. 😃
I’m surprised they didn’t expand on LN2 with DLC and went on to make LN3.  LN2 was great but for some reason, there’s tiny disappointment with it.
00:7 *m*
So cool have been waiting to see "Little Nightmares III" to appear under the radar. The game looks great and gives me chills as Little Nightmares is a cherished game of mine. I just hope the devs are making this game to expand upon the franchise in a similar manner to Tarsier, instead of butchering it to milk it for money. But I trust Supermassive to maintain the franchise without taking it off the rails. Will you guys be using Unreal Engine 5?
I like it but.. what about mono and six… :(
I thought this wasnt gonna be a thing and improved everybody wrong fuck the people who said there wasnt gonna be a third one yall can suck ass im extreme,y happy abt this if you didnt notice
It's better this game have a good ending
Sucks there won’t be anymore of the original lore 😢 but this game looks really fun
Can't wait to see cory play this when it comes out
Its looks really good but wheres the association with mono and six? 😭😭
Worrdd
The mirror is giving me lady vibes ngl
I am really exited for this new game. new characters, amazing new monsters, and a I know definitely good plot.
@robertapupi
This is so cool no one knows how long I have been waiting for a trailer to release, I’m so happy😄
I just watched people play through the entire first two games and a couple months later this?! This looks amazing. Maybe this time I can play it myself instead of watching it.
Watch one betray the other
❤❤❤❤
I just know the soundtracks are going to be LEGITTTT
Literally so exited!!!
Take your time developers!😄
Me and my family will be having a little nightmares replay leading up to the game!!❤️❤️❤️ we loved the first two!!!
I can already tell 2024 is going to be amazing because this banger is releasing!! Love this series so much fr fr. Also i never buy games at launch, but this, this is an exception.
Juego en ascendencia
0:33, hear that?
Plz bring back mono plz😢😢
я ждал этого 4 нет 5 тысяч лет
Although I will miss mono and six a lot this still looks epic!
I wish there is local co-op available as wiki just only mentioned online co-op..
Just finished listening to the podcast im so hyped!!!!!! I wiah there was more episodes to the podcast tho
Please for Android phones 🥺
While I love this game series, IM SO EXCITED TO SEE 8BITRYAN PLAYING THISSSSSSSS
That is a  C H O N K Y  baby bro. 💀
There’s no mono and six yet because the this is a prequel to little nightmares 2 so if this is the last one this is the first one.
YAAAAAAAAAASSSS LETS GOOOOOOOO!!!!!!
I have an Idea. Since last they said about coop ruining the horror atmosphere.   How about still allowing coop but both players get to see story cutscene story differently (throught different glass that gives different cutscene each or if it's online coop its 2 different cutscene) with the twist they are enemies. That way it's still horror of at some point one have to betray the other.  If people happen to stream with this idea, it's gonna look amazing. Who decide to betray. Who was playing the villain and does the victim knows?
Little Nightmares one: Six gets the same hunger as the lady  at the end. Little Nightmares 2: Mono becomes the man that was chasing them this whole time. Little Nightmares 3: Cute bird boy and wrench girl becomes massive fucking doll baby by the end of the game.
Is it going to be based on the story of Mono or Six somehow?
CAN you Add in this Game A ferryman
NO FUCKING WAY.
When Tarsier said they were done with the Little Nightmares IP. I had lost hope. But to see this is such a joy.
FINALLY!!
I love Little Nightmares.. Playing the 2nd game as we speak.. I just hope part 3 is actually long!
Its about darn time...
I hope 🤞 this is online multiplayer. Wish they done that on Little Nightmares 2 with Six & Mono.
no no NO NO MORE WEIRD ITEM TRAVEL first we got tv now mirror???
I think little nightmares 3 should be the two kids in this and six trying to save mono from becoming thin man by trapping him in between a tv and a mirror so it would reverse time and then finally defeating the signal tower which would be controlled by the weird doll thing in this trailer
OMG YESSS ANOTHER LITTLE NIGHTMARES IS BEING RELEASED. I have both Little Nightmares 1-2, I can't wait to play the new one!!!!
Somehow, I feel like they are still going to work in the first two games in some way.
НАКОНЕЦ-ТО Я ЖДАЛ ЭТОГО МОМЕНТА 2 НЕТ 5 ТЫСЯЧ ЛЕТ!!!
Man i hope we can save Mono and Six with these two new people
Estoy seguro pero seguro de que este juego pasa despues de little nigmares 1
Insert obligatory Yes! Yeah! Scene from SpongeBob. 🎉 Little Nightmares is back!!!❤
Coryxkenshin boutta get ready to play this
😍 I am very excited
hope they wont betray eachother lel
We need *local coop* as an option!  Devs claim that local coop would "break the athmosphere". I disagree. And even if the devs are right, for many of us, it's either local coop or nothing, so why not keep the option for those that want it???
Little Nightmares COOP! How cool!  Oh, no couch coop? Hard pass.  The lack of local multiplayer in a game like this makes no sense to me and other local coop fans. Propably the only reason to not include local coop in a game like this would be to force players to buy the game twice - once for them and once for their friend. Long story short: Greed.  I don't consider myself a Little Nightmares fan, the existence of coop in the upcoming third game made me want to test this out with a friend, but the absence of local coop is going to make me forget about this game's existence in the upcoming days. What a shame.
Watching this back i’m realizing how many connections there are to the sound of nightmares podcast. Like the city wall full of pipes and gears and the carnival. Just hope there’s a big mall location we haven’t seen yet
Im so excited 😰😰😰
God, this looks great!
Coryxkenshin is 100% going to play this.
How did YouTube let 2 weeks pass before letting me know this exists??
Ждем! Как всегда круто!
Knowing Little Nightmares, this game could come out a year after 2024.                Low and Alone are obliviously going to become evil at the end.
The soundtrack reminds me the one from phil tippet’s mad god
The only thing I don’t like about little nightmares, is that the games aren’t longer
YEEEEES
What? I thought there was not going to be a third game of this. THANK YOU I LOVE LITTLE NIGHTMARES ITS MY FAVOURITE GAME
For real I didn’t think this was real until now. Thank you for making a 3rd game ❤
J'ai fini les deux premiers, j'espère que le troisième sera à la hauteur. Je l'attend avec impatience ! 😛
They should add the barber 💈
I'm so happy ❤️
🤩 3
IM SO HAPPY IVE BEEN WAITING SINCE I BEAT LITTLE NIGHTMARES 2 FOR THIS all though i gotta wait til 2024 IM STILL HYPED
Can't believe I missed this, only found it cause I'm just now playing Little Nightmares 2(watched the gameplay when it first released and already played 1 but for some reason never got around to playing 2) and I was wondering if there was any news on a potential 3rd game. To my surprise, we got a whole trailer. While I am gonna miss Six and Mono(though we'll probably see Six in some way or another) and the aesthetic is quite different from the previous two games, I have no doubt these two new characters will be great too, and the setting looks pretty cool. I hope they can pull this off without tarsier but I'm confident it's gonna turn out great
Please don’t flop, I love this franchise and I want it to succeed!
Thank God. Finally!! I love you, Bandi.
In love…
I am very happy that I can go beyond dreaming.
Still traumatized by Little Nightmares II ending.
Awesome can't wait 😎
I CANT WAIT FOR LITTLE NIGHTMARES 3 ❤❤❤❤
I ve been waiting for this but does this have a part with six and mono
So... How exactly did it went with Tarsier stidios? You just say to them something like "your services are no longer needed" or how was it?
Greatttttt!!!!, I've been waiting a long time to see this😢😢😢
Wow I’m so excited for the next game the design looks so good this is my favorite series ever love it 😍
i have faith this game will be good and probably one of the only games actually worth preordering
Looks like its going to be a multiplayer experience
I bet one of them either dies or gets betrayed by one if them.
If they screwed it up with heavy use of cutscenes, i'm out. There's nothing i hate more, than taking away player free-will in a game.
LETS GOO IM READY
Yayyy :DDDD
This is awesome! Is the game going to be multi-player? I would love to play this with my friend.
I'm looking forward to watching more play throughs when this comes out! Everything is off to a great start! Around 2 weeks ago I saw this and was like NAH BRO AIN'T NO WAY! In a good way! I'M SO HAPPY :D
Awesome WOW Amazing
HOLY CRAP THIS LOOKS AMAZING! It looks like a gloriously horrifying mix of Studio Ghibli and Tim Burton.
Was so hyped when I first saw this, the trailer is spreading like Wild-fire throughout the Fandom and Little Nightmares fans has risen from the Shadows once again Thank you for giving us a third game Bandai Namco!  Edit: You can hear Six's theme at the end
Will this explore the world of the other children before North Wind came to take Six away?
FINNALY!
МЫ ЭТОГО ЖДАЛИ 5 ТЫСЯЧ ЛЕТ, НЕТ, 7 ТЫСЯЧ ЛЕТ!
I have played little nightmares since the beginning of the series and I can't wait to have my heart race again!
Это что little nightmares 3
finnaly!!!!!
CO-OP this time PLEASE!!!
Nice video
👍👍👍
I wonder if they have it coop with friends this time. I've always been a fan of this series.
Theory: The pale city is a multidimensional gateway  Ok lemme explain So the video's description reads as following: 'Are you ready to return to the Nowhere, little ones?' The word return suggesting we've been there before. And so far we've only been to the following places: The pale city, the nest, the maw and the wilderness, and from the look of things, the carnival/boardwalk and the new desert city are entirely new areas, we've learned with the franchise that blue is a common colour, and in these new areas, we see different main colours, or more than blue and grey (eg: the desert has very warm colours in contrast to the pale city), meaning that perhaps the desert city is a parallel reality to the pale one, and from the sound of things, this mentioned nowhere is a main hub of some kind, linking every chapter together, and going back to the keyword *return* , i theorise that perhaps the world we explored in the first 2 games + it's mobile spinoff is a dimension connecting the other worlds together via the mirrors low and alone travel through, and the signal towers influence has perhaps spread through these other worlds.
из инди игры в что-то большее
아 기대돼!!!!!!!!!
No local coop?! No thanks!
This is very cool I know they would not let us
OH MY GODDDDDDD
I wanna know what happened to mono and six but i think like there gonna meat six there
YYYYYYYYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSS I KNEW IT I KNEW THAT DESPITE YOU SAYING YOU WOULDNT MAKE A THIRD GAME YOU WOULD I KNEW IT 2  YEARS AGO I KNEW IT. anyway please let it be free for a brief period of time cause i cant buy it probably
The symbol of the broken mirror and the darkness surrounding it has got to have some link to The Lady from the 1st game, I'm fascinated to see what it could possibly mean.
the rest of the year I'm only going to be thinking about Little Nightmares 3!!!
IM GONNA CRY. YES. YES  ABSOLUTELY.
Wow they lied to us. They lied to us to surprise us 😭
My 1st and 2nd game purchased on steam. ❤🎉😊
I wonder if six will be the baddy in the end of this one after the events of LN2...maybe guild ate on her.
I hope that this is 2 player I've waited quite a bit, but I'm rlly hyped that it is coming out :D
Very nice
To be honest, for some reason it reminds me more not of the previous two "Little Nightmares" games, but of the cartoon "Nine/9" (2009) from the Walt Disney Studios 😄
Who needs it without local coop?
Will the song Little Nightmare 3 be different or the same as Little Nightmare 1 and 2?
Could this possibly be a co-op!!! (nvm it is!!!)
YYEYEYEYEYEYEYEYEYEYYEYEYEYEYYE WOOOHOOOOOOOOO
Yo can I get a early acess game for my channel lmao-
I hope that at the end of the game the Low one will take off the mask and Mono face will be under it. And this mirror itself has something to do with the Six, which will become the final boss
Mono can travel through TV’s 📺  Low can travel through Mirrors  🪞  You see where I’m going?  😅😳🫣
SOOOOOOO COOOOOOOOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
I ask God that everything works out and that it is another great game that you guys made, please do your best! I know you can do it, and I know how much effort you make
Hope this game brings clousure to six and mono!
uh...when is the little nightmares 3 gonna be released? cause I didn't see a release date on there at the end of the video
Finally I was waiting for this 🎉 for long
seing the broken mirror that looks like the lady from ln1 have, maybe the main antagonist gonna be six imo
Looking cool!
I CAN'T WAIT!!!!!
Nice
well, definitely something different. Not a LM honestly. "It takes two" but horror. Everyone can hate me, but that's what i think.
An interesting episode. You need to watch the full version.
:)
yeeeeeeeeees!
I don’t think this is six and mono…
@coryxkenshin
The fact It's multiplayer is so exciting, i will be able to play with my older sister since we both love little nightmares and the lore :D
i like this game
yeeeees, this game is so cool
😮🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
Honestly sad cuz ghers no six and i really wanted to know more about their story but Im still so excited!!!! Thx bandi for blessing us with a new game!
im soo happy I'm crying my dreams com true
KAPITALNA GRA, ZAPEWNE NUMER III BĘDZIE TAK SAMO DOBRY A MOŻE I LEPSZY OD POPRZEDNICH. POZDRAWIAM CIOTKA!
Huh
nice trailer
Without Mono and six... there's no excitement to play
i thought i was free...
Two can you know
My dad might ruin disbarred mods but he's definitely more also the only access demo
All of the little nightmares franchise I'm so excited for this new game
I usually get scared to see a beloved franchise make more games, however, is they can do this right, I would be happy to see how they plan to flesh out this amalgamated nightmareish world. I just hope they don't overdo it.
I'm happy to see a 3rd installment, but unfortunately I don't think this will answer anything from Little Nightmares 2. From the looks of it, Little Nightmares 3, appears to be a co-op version of the game. Now we are probably missing quite a lot as this is simply an "announcement" trailer, but despite being happy for a continuation, I'm saddened that we might not get a proper conclusion for Little Nightmares 2.
Nice video
I'm in it
Hii
Everything its great!! But the not the main characters i dont really like them with that hats and is like carnival and please do the giant baby with a better face and model it pretty sucks now but everything can be optimized!! And im so happy that it will be out but another thing,all the atmosphere should be less colored because its too yellow right? It wasn’t like that in the other chapters i know that this isn’t a trailer but i hope i was for help.
Good
I miss mono and six
I hope these two distroy the loop
I've waited a little too long for this.....
Welcome back to your little nightmares.
I guess little nightmares lll also won't happy ending
2024 but chapter 3 is in 2025 or wat
i don't think little nightmares 2 can ever be surpassed, but i'll give this game a go anyways
I love you a lot
So hyped
i hope this old war veteran toast machine PC can handle this amazing game, I believe in you buddy we can do this!
Even without mono and six, i think they'll sprinkle a little mono and six in there
1:05 you can see what seems to be six with her back turned within the mirror.
OMG!!
Where is the horror? The trailer did not convey the feeling of isolation and fear at all. Compare with the trailer of the second part (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI9zBBTyX-E&ab_channel=BANDAINAMCOEurope), there is horror! And the trailer of the third part does not look scary at all.
IM SO EXCITED
LITTLE NIGHTMARES IS ALWAYS A W!!
I'm sure now it's going to be a fun time. Lo' looks so cool with his bow and his design! It was not created by the same people.
Thank you so much!!! I never lost hope the series would continue. I absolutely cannot wait for this game! But I will, because it’ll be so worth it. Little nightmares 3, here we come.🎉
Excellent
I can't wait, I'm so excited!
I can't believe how far little nightmares has come I can't wait for this game!!!
LETS GOOOOOOO LITTLE NIGHTMARES IN MY TOP 3 FAVORITE FRANCHISES - S TIER WORK
I´m gonna miss Mono and Six... I just hope Supermassive Games doesn´t screw this up, but I bet they won´t get any near to the quality of Tarsier Studios.
YES YEEEES YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES!
whennnn?
I wonder what the mirrors could mean. Maybe Matpat can help us out.
Super ❤❤❤
YES
WHATS YOUR ETA?
👍
Wow that's good
Finally 2024 I been Waiting for 2 years
OH MY GOODNESS I DIDNT THINK IT WOULD COME OUT
LETS GOOO
Thumbs up
What IF these 2 characters are the KEYS to break out the nightmarish loop of Mono And Six to avoid their future transformation as becoming The Thin Man And The Lady, That would be something else, and cool , considering the fact that we can now break their endless nightmare with these childrens on Little Nightmares 3...
I really didnt expect a third game! WHAT?! IM SO HAPPYYYY
Im hoping Little Nightmares III will have elements of It Takes Two in it. This would be such a twisted world to explore with a partner! Am i wrong?
Finley lets go  I'm so hyped man.
Ngl Im kind of Sad it wasnt more depressing hahaha
I may check this game out, really depends weather or not it gets put on ps plus, if it doesn’t, I’ll probably just skip it  Also, small theory, what if these two become the chefs from little nightmares 1, so technically not a theory but just a cool idea
When is little night mares 1 android coming
I'm excited i hope we get more of those body horror designs like the teacher and janitor also love the giant baby that you brought back from the concepts of little nightmares 2
No way! This looks great!
Awesome! I'm so excited! The best part this game might explain why six betrayed mono.
Finally there making a Little Nightmares 3 can’t wait to play it 😃👊
AYOOooOOo WE BEEN NEEDING THIS!
I WANT NOW
i Wanna play this game so bad
little nightmares 2 left me starving for more content, super excited for this game
HOLY FRICK… i loved the first two games SO much! im really glad you decided to make a third one! extremely excited for this!
it's the best soundtrack i've ever heard, omg
This looks seriously SICK! I love it!
mal posso esperar pra jogar esse maravilhoso game <3
This great thing
CONSIDER ME HYPED FOR THIS!
Hold on isn’t weird how Six was in 3 little nightmares games but not in this one
I am hyped. I only watched tje playthroughs of the first 2 games but now I am commoted to playing myself
Let's hope that the characters don't betray each other like six did to mono Also,i'm really curios of what this will be about❤
А вот это стоит подождать! 😻 Музыкальное сопровождение правда надеюсь, что поменяют или придумают новое т.к. понятно, что мир старенький и привычный, но добавить в него опустошенности мелодией было бы очень хорошо. Ждём новых историй!)
I was just told the 3rd game is coming out, and I had to see the trailer as soon as possible!! I could not be more excited, and the trailer kinda reminds me of that one movie, I think it was just called "9", about those dolls in the post apocalyptic wasteland with creepy machines hunting them. Love it!!
LETS FUCKING GOOO
Its still one of my favret games
I doubt we will, but I really hope we’ll get some continuation of what happened to six after the Maw.
they should add a cory easter egg or something that would be pretty funny and I think multiplayer is getting added if so that would be pretty cool
Я себе купил тренинг сет в наруто то боруто шипуден страйкер и не могу тренинг сет использовать а я его купил... как его использовать я за что заплатил? вот пейн купленный мне дался за 30 рублей сразу и норм а вот пятый сизн пас тренинг купленный ни фига ни одной трненировки недал а я его купил!!! что за нафиг!!!
а где жалобу оставить можно?
This is amazing like everyone said!😆🤩
Super super
This is going to be cool and that giant baby boss is going to be a intense boss fight I can’t wait to this come out in 2024
Im really curious with how they are going to tie it in with the last game
It’s about time…

Vish

idk why but my first thought when i looked at the little guy in green was...."tricky from madness combat ?"
ОЧЕНЬ ЖДУ
When i first heard tbey werent going to make another game i was so sad. Now this trailer drops! I am soooo excited. Little Nightmares is my favorite game series ever. Thank you Bandai Namco!!
I love everything about that.

good job  BANDAI NAMCO i really happy now
Amazing work honestly ❤❤❤
Awesome! I cant wait for Little nightmares 3
Bandai Namco, please make another wonderful collectors edition for this game, like you did with the previous two games. You're quite possibly the only one publisher left that cares about customers who love physical copies. Even on PC
My prayers have come true
honestly i dont care whether or not any of the previous characters are in it because I'm still gonna eat it uo
nice
New characters and area’s previous two games
Give my boy mono a chance to clap back
Give my boy mono a chance to clap back
Cant wait
This game looks like a masterpiece already can't wait for little nightmares 3.  you guys never disappoint us... i jinxed it. We have too wait until 2025 😭
THANK YOU GUYS SO MUCH IM SO HAPPY RIGHT NOW I CANT WAITTTT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 10:12 8/27/23     3:06 PM 8/28/23 im incredibly disappointed no way they copied my main man mono this is fucking bullshit 3:07 PM 8/28/23
Will liltte nightmares have more games or will this be the last? Or does it depend on if this game does well
SO EXCITINGGGG
YES! It's happening!!!
Another mirror user?! oo i can't wait to find out how he's connected to Mono!
Maybe some lore about the people eating children and why the children are so small compared to th adults and also why every single adult is so morbidly obese except a select few
My god, it's still going! Will it be a prequel, or a sequel? TBD! Either way, I'm glad THERE'S MORE!
AAAAA IM SO EXCITED
HUGE
Im scared if there's going to be a twist like lnm2
Actually can't wait
I like ittt😭
Very happy for co-op mode!
NNO WAY!!!
Yes! I was so hoping there would be another one!
im crying omggggggg yes!!! I've been waiting for thissssss
0:49 why did I automatically ship then at this part lol
I hope that the continuation of little nightmares 2
Mono sixWhere did you go?
I wanna fight grown up six through puzzles for revenge for momo.
Where is six and mono 😭😭😭😭😭
Not sure if this means anything but the mirrors that Low & Alone go through look to be the same mirrors from the Little nightmares 1 in the lady’s quarters. Possible connections?
olm cok heyecanlandım
FUCK YEAH!
not as dramatic as part 2
time to waste money
YEA YEA YEA YEAH!!
But..and six??
I honestly didn’t think they were gonna make third game, but now I’m hyped knowing they are
horror  series  is my favourite ❤
I AM SO EXCITED! I NEVER THOUGHT THIS SERIES WOJLD RETURN 😭😭😭😭😭 Literally one of my most favorite games of all time! I'm so happy!!!!
It's more like a wasteland/desert than a dark city
hopefully a little nightmares 4that girl  doesn't betray us
My only fear is that if the game is "little nightamers-y" anymore, because the huge doll doesn't really look like something tarsier studious would do, yk what I mean?
😢mono six ????😢
Bit of a shame that Mono and Six aren't there, but I bet it'll be equally as interesting as the previous two!
Oh my fucking God I'm so excited sad that Tarsier isint working on it anymore
I love the eerie music and the small tribute to mono having the ability to move through TVs being used as mirrors. Truly makes me appreciate the detail and everything in every single LN game.
looks very much like 2 player horror to me
IM JUMPING, LITERALLY. I CANT WAITTTTTT THIS LOOKS SO GOODD
Will this be game be in the  bundle that gives you the first two games? (Btw I have been waiting a long time for a third game in this series!)
I hope we see Six again, even if it's just a brief cameo.
I dont know bout anyone else but i'm kinda nervous. I mean this so far looks good, but when its a different team taking on the franchise, it just ends up paling in comparison to its predcessors. I dont want that to be the case since 2 was so good but its just a feeling..
SCREAMS??? IM ACTUALLY GOING TO EXPLODE IM SO EXCITED HEKP??@?@?!!! I LOVE THIS SERIES SO MUCH AND I DIDNT THINK THEY WERE GONNA MAKE ANOTHER GAME FOR A WHILE?? THE WAY IM STIMMING AND TWITCHING RIGHT NOW IS CRAZY
WERE SO BAAAAACK
The new developer being Supermassive doesn't inspire much faith. They had one hit years ago and everything since has been a mess.
It doesn't feel right without Mono and Six
жду мултиплеер, ура, я счастлив
простите, что я спиратил предыдущую часть игры.....
Every little nightmares game so far has been a masterpiece,and this looks like it will be just as good or better!
Me: BUT I WANT IT NOW! I WANT IT NOW! I WANT IT NOW!
INSANE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
if Cory plays this he gon have some trust issues from little nightmares 2
Amazing as always
MAY THIS FRANCHISE LIVE ON FOR A LONG TIME
Mono and Sasha Six might not be there but I'm so eager to play it next year
Após  anos de espera meus amigos 🍷🇧🇷 venha vento do norte
So excited
YEESSSSSSSSS
is it true that there online co-op?
I cant wait for this
Nightmare comeback
the new characters look so ass man
My favorite game series im screaming of joy
no way...
reminds me of an old movie from my child hood called 6 or 9... cant remember the exact name! (EDIT: its called 9)
very nice
YEEEEES !!!!! Can't wait to play !
yesssssssss
OH YEAH
I wonder will I be able to play together with a friend on one console (like Unravel 2) or just online coop?
FINALLY!!! AFTER YEARS ITS WE WONN!!!!!❤❤
これ1作目のレディの鏡じゃね？
aw i cant wait for this (especially the ost i listened to ln1 and 2 soundtrack on loop for ages)
This is truly amazing, i jave wanted this for years. But i have to say, it doesnt look as scary as i imagined. But i dont care. IT'S LITTLE NIGHTMARES 3!
Something tells me the yellow shirt character probably Six... I am getting sus vibes
mmmmmm I dunno. Seems to be missing that magic somehow.
reminds me of little nightmares 1 with its style and atmosphere. These new characters look great. Unless they're not new and its six and mono under the masks. But uh yeah we'll have to wait and see how the game is. I'm excited!
Where is Six , mono and the others , i miss them please  Bring they back to us😭😢😢
If this is a co-op game similar to "A way out" I'm going to be the first buyer
please someone tell me is this set after number one or another prequel
it doesn't feel like little nightmares
OMG I can BELIEVE my dream is come true :D
I have to say that I was worried about Little Nightmares ever since Tarsier Studios left the franchise but seeing how Supermassive Games is handling the series now I think it’s in very good hands. Thank you Bandai for keeping our Nightmares alive and well!
Was just watching someone play through Little Nightmares 1 and 2 again for nostalgia - little did I know that Little Nightmares 3 just got announced! I’ve always enjoyed the Little Nightmares games so I can’t wait! 🙏🏽
Where is the betrayer.
ЛУЧШАЯ ИГРААААААААААААА
БОЖЕ ДААААА УРААААА
W
I heard rumors about the fact there wouldn’t be a little nightmares 3… you can’t imagine how happy am i to see it isn’t the case 🔥🔥
ja to me preparando
I love how in the trailers the creepy humming is always heard. It brings the childhood fear to life imo, and the sound of children is sometimes creepy 💀
Omg I’m so excited for it i love little nightmares i have little nightmares 1 & 2
Oh lord, it looks promising !
Wow, I Can't Wait For That Epic Moment!🤩 Six- Yeah Me Tho Mono-
I miss Mono already 😢
I'm so happy that we get another game <3
Expanding on the companionship mechanic we had with Six on LN2, with inspirations on the co-op mechanics of It Takes Two, I'd say we have yet another masterpiece of the franchise. Point me to the preorder button.
This is so interesting I love it
Let coryxkenshin know
I'm so hyped for this game, all previous titles (even damn DLC's) were absolute masterpiece, already in my wishlist and I'm 100% buying this, though I'm bit disappointed that there is no DLC for the part 2
I’m literally balling tears right now! Thank you so much for making a 3rd! This is my absolute all time favorite game!
Dude is that the guests walking in the streets??? Also in the screenshots for the game I see what looks like the maw, I cannot wait! I’m so glad this game isn’t cancelled and that it’s in good hands with supermassive who helped make the second game
I...was not expecting this.. when i heard tariser studios wanted to move on, i assumed it was dead.. i hope this game remains just as good, hopefully its the present timeline too
WHO’S EXCITED?
oh my gosh! i love the little nightmares series im so excited!!
This is crazy!! Holy fuc* dude, I were waiting for this, long, long time ago. I can't believe.
cool
Omg I've always thought a mirror traversing power would be wonderful to a like this I have a character like that I named their MG for mirror girl lol but the number name is eleven
Can't wait for this to release next year I've been with the series for 3 years and can't wait for this to release
@coryxkenshin
Что ж, господа, как огромный фанат маленьких кошмаров, могу уверенно заявить: трейлер просто шикарный. Разработчики явно пошли в разнос, получилось безумно атмосферно. Из наблюдений первое что бросается в глаза - это то, что ракурсы остались прежними, один только подъём по длинной лестнице в начале навивает приятные воспоминания о первой части. С другой же стороны атмосфера сильно изменилась, во-первых тона: если в первой части это был серый (ассоциирующийся с бледностью и голодом), во-второй голубой (куда более живой и загадочный, отсылающий к эскапизму, словно всё что происходит сон), то здесь чётко создаётся впечатление выжженности, абсолютной безжизненности, и обстановка конечно соответствует эстетики цвета (пустыня, разрушенные мельницы, вагонетки, картинка, которая обветривает глаза и хрустит на зубах). Становится понятно, что локации первых двух частей стоит воспринимать как вход в мир ужасов, где ещё сохранились обрывки нормальности, здесь же место повествование находится уже куда глубже в недрах мира. И персонажи ведут себя соответствующе, если раньше это были просто дети с огромной силой воли, которые перебивались от кровли к кровле и продвигались дальше используя подручные предметы и смекалку, то здесь всё уже иначе, очевидно что те кто способен забраться так далеко должен быть достаточно научен и подготовлен, главные герои выглядят как раз так. Они создают образ мародёров поневоле, которые подстроились под реалии того мира где должны выживать. Во-первых они оба носят подходящую одежду и маски, которые спасают не только от песка, но и от лишних взглядов (принцип, который выкупил ещё Моно). Во-вторых, девочка носит с собой на постоянной основе гаечный ключ (что куда удобнее чем искать подходящий предмет когда нужно что-то разбить), также у неё имеются специальные очки, сразу напрашивается концепт механизмов, вполне возможно она сможет что-то конструировать/чинить, у парня же символичная воронья маска (а воронам, как вы наверняка заметили, уделяется в трейлере много внимания), да и зонтики на которых планируют персонажи похоже сделаны из перьев, исходя из этого можно предположить что он будет иметь какую-то особую связь с птицами. Отдельный интерес вызывают антогонисты, они прекрасно вписываются в лор мира, и к тому же отсылают к уже существующим канонам (это понятно тем кто в теме). Тут, пожалуй, следует начать с зеркала, которое нам несколько раз показывают крупным планом, в конце герои ныряют в него, так что есть предложение что это будет что-то вроде аналога телевизоров-телепортов из второй части (ну или разработчики придумают концепт Зазеркалья, которое будет напрямую связано с реальным миром), но это не главное, куда интереснее что скорее всего главным злодеем игры станет Зеркальный монстр (персонаж, мелькавший в комиксах и очень полюбившийся создателям фанфиков), по крайней мере будет очень странно если его не добавят. И кстати опустыненная локация может отсылать к Северному ветру (другому антогонисту из всё тех же комиксов), его тоже было бы интересно увидеть в игре. Второй крупной отсылкой является тот факт, что персонажи в какой-то момент попадут в гости к Гостям. Судя по всему (почти со стопроцентной вероятностью) нас познакомят с городом откуда обжоры попадают на Чрево. Отдельно хочу отметить тот момент, где из трубы показываются сначала две длинные руки (что само по себе вызывает ужас, особенно у тех кто помнит Сторожа), а потом появляются ещё несколько рук, очень вписывающийся в игру момент, один из таких которыми она запоминается надолго. Стоит кстати упомянуть, что идея такого многоруково персонажа тоже неоднократно встречается в фанфиках и просто замечательно впишется в лор ЛН.  Ну и конечно огромный пупс, как же без него. Он очевидно станет самым большим монстром во всей серии. Учитывая всю тематику кошмаров, которая завязана на детстве, вообще очень странно что ожившим игрушкам до сих пор уделяли не слишком много внимания. А в целом, да, это всё тот же родной Литл Найтмерс, подаривший нам всем так много приятных эмоций. Пусть даже игра сильнее ушла в постапокалипсис и герои уже не такие беззащитные, но это говорит лишь о развитии уже имеющихся идей. Ну и конечно наверняка мы увидим отсылки на уже знакомых героев, разработчики точно просто так их не забросят. Так что все ждём новых деталей и молимся за то чтоб игра была оригинальной и самобытной (независимо оттого оправдает ли это наши безликие ожидания).
It's five nani??
I thought that little nightmares 3 coincided with little nightmares 2, where in the ending Mono transforms into a thin man, but in the real ending Six is seen with a figure like her where, however, Siz looks behind and there is a newspaper with a company in person or something. It was thought to be the new character. Still, I can't wait to see it in action
pleas not another betrayal !!
AAAAAAHHHHHH YES AND THEY HAVE LOCS,THIS REMINDS ME OF THE MOVIE 9,IM HEREEEEEE FOR IT ALL💜💜💜
OMG! finalllllllyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy, can't wait to play, realease fast

There are slight changes that make you miss the older games but it look great all the same I can’t wait to see my favorite YouTubers play this
There are slight changes that make you miss the older games but it look great all the same I can’t wait to see my favorite YouTubers play this
Definitely not as cool characters like the rain jacket and the bag. But ohwell
That giant baby reminds me of the Watchers from Drakengard
I’m excited but mono or six deserve to be in the game for understand why six did that in the end
OH MY GOD THERE'S A THIRD ONE. 😍 This trailer blew me away. I can't wait till this game comes out.
Being honest I was a little disappointed that they didn't put Six and Mono :(
Just remember we are a kid and turn into a monster at the end
I got out of bed and started running around when my cousin sent me this your games are so amazing and the story is so interesting i cannot wait for this one to come out i never want little nightmares to end
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🫶🫶🫶🫶💙💙💙💙💙💙
Precinto que en este juego estará avienta do en bolivia
If this is little nightmares 3, that it's gotta be connected to the first 2, hopefully the story gets expanded off of the first games, like a mono and six appearance of smth, anyways the game looks great! Hopefully there's as many bosses as the 2nd game.
It's incredible!!!!💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
its my favorite game im so excited!!!!!
Been waiting for this moment heck yeah *grabs wallet*
Nah man we need justice for my boy mono 😭
Other people admiring how good this game looks: Me: Oh hell naw is that a giant baby
it'd be like Alice Through the Looking Glass in a nightmarish way.
these characters are so cute!!! i’m actually so so excited for this <3
2 days ago 😅
When does it come out?!!❤
UUY
Completely suprised me I thought they were done with this franchise
Please make a good DLC for part 2 !!!
Bruh no cross platform or same room co-op 👁️👄👁️
I SWEAR IM BOUT TO BE ONE OF THE FIRST NON YOUTUBERS TO BUY THIS GAME HAHAHAHA
DIOSMIO  COMO ES POSIBLE ESTE SUCESOOOOOO
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Ostras
rfr dctulf yf dscjnt
Now we need another game of ori also....this game and ori are my all.time.fav 2D platformer games
I was so surprised happy and super excited with this news.. 1 and 2 were epic game..this games looks more polished with new mechanisms ...
Im so suprised its coming back, can't wait for the game!! 🎉🎉
Any chance of releasing it before WW3 in december?
Watching the trailer with Metallica on shuffle was certainly an experience for me once I saw this trailer Freaking amazing, can't wait for the game
I really want multiplayer for this game! We also need to see the return of The Thin Man. It would link the worlds perfectly
Bad idea
This is gonna be the best game in the world But I'm a little sad because it's seems different from other games
I really appreciate them reusing their older ideas ^^ (the giant baby and the mirrors)
Wao
am I the only one that already started making up theories?
That mirror and the dark smoke makes me think that either the lady or six will play a part in this game
OMG❤❤😢
YES YES YES FINNALY LMG IVE WAITED FOR THIS FOR SO LONG
WE NEED TO GET CORY ON THIS 🔥🔥🔥
I’m excited for this game to come out. I’m also enjoying listening to the companion podcast!
I can't believe its actually REAL
Need a preorder date.
GENTE COMO ASSIMMMMM??????????!?!?!!!!!!
I loved the nightmares I aesthetic most with the kitchen and passengers
how great the truth! my confidence was that I knew that this saga would return 😈
the broken mirrors and stuff really make me think six could genuinely be the villain or at least be involved somehow
I think this is a lot like mono the fact that they can travel through mirrors is cool ad the new monsters kinda look like the old ones maybe they’re still disfigured in a way
I'm so excited ❤
Let's gooo ❤🤩🤩😍
It’s cool how each game has an entirely different atmosphere. So far my favorite is the first game and the Japanese ship theme but I’m exited to see where this new direction goes.
Hey guys when will this part come out
Will this take place in the same universe/world as the previous 2 games?
LN3❤
ive been waiting so long🥳🥳
Guys, I think the mirror symbolizes another dimension like on TV
Well done
And I thought the doctor was the scariest thing from the series.
I really loved the first two games with all my heart but I’m pretty worried now that Tarsier isn’t in the picture. I don’t like the character design, looks unrelated to me and reminds me of It Takes Two. I really hope this won’t disappoint and will remain creepy & dark with great art and story design
I am SOOOO HYPED!🎉
the time has come...
I wish next game or DLC for this game can make Mono or Six or Both Back.
wow!? this my favorite game! Looking forward to the release of the game!
Got me heart attack! Thank you for continuing this franschies, I can't wait for this😆
Already got LN 1 and 2, cant wait to see how this one’ll push PS5
OMG LITTLE NIGHTMARES 3 IS ACTUALLY GONNA BE REAL!!!??? YAYAYYA
aight i just KNOW im gonna be left feeling emotionally crippled by this game at the end of it LEZ DO THIS!!
yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees!
I cannot believe it is actually continuing. I really thought it'd be the end because it got said so... I'm so excited, oh my.
Im so exicteteddddssd❤❤❤❤❤❤
I'm so excited for this i can't wait🤭
little nightmares  3 demo desember 10th 2023
The market
these two fellas definitely have a relation to mono and six. what i mean is no betrayals will occur, i hope.
I thought it was a joke, but when I saw the Steam page, I was already convinced... In general, waiting for the game!
I hope the co-op doesn't get in the way. The second character worked in 2 because she was independent and didn't rely on the player. Here, I'm worried that the AI won't be as well done considering scenes now have to be made to support another human player at any point.
I have goosebumps
It's really…? It's been so long… I love this games ❤ I'm waiting…!!!
hopefully more substance this time than style??? LN2 was pretty bland...I hope they've evolved the gameplay a bit more than just running through empty rooms that look nice...love LN1 and I hope this introduces a better story too...
I miss littlenightmares she will be back
Who’s the new characters?
The nightmare continues once more..............
Enfin
Yess the nightmare continues!!
So can play multiplayer now!?
The silhouette in the mirror at 1:04... 👀
Both games were absolutely amazing in they're own rights, but this looks like yet another one to masterfully takes it's place on the Horror genre throne once again! 😮 Well done, well done indeed! 👍 Also one more thing, I just love how each Little Nightmares game is very similar yet so different in dynamics/environments/aesthetics/adversaries/haunting soundtracks and those crazy plot twists every time! I somehow think that the ending in this one will still be a plot twist of some kind but be not what we were all expecting, can't wait to see more of this in due time!
Finally the time has come!
Honestly im so glad they gave us new characters instead of continuing on with six or mono cause the last 2 games seemed to tell us how their story ended so now its time for a new story yk  Edit: I'm just spit balling here but imagine if this was like 2 and 5 just like mono and six but their names where deuce and quintette 🥺💕 idk I just find that so cute  Edit of edit: The girls name is Noone I just found out from watching the chapters so maybe it isnt about numbers anymore unless Noone is 3 from what i found idk 😐 but it's still cute
Hell yes! Now this I'm looking forward to
new location unlocked: The desert! that's fitting because of the looks and the feels of the game which is apocalysed
already making theories screaming saving my money for merch i love these little goobers already so excited
That’s a plague mask….
😍😍😊
I really really hope that Tobias Lilja is creating the soundtrack again 🎵
Man I think I'm 100% sure that in empty chair it will be Mono (I love Mono) They are keeping it for a surprise
WE WANT COOP
What I've learned from the other two games is to prepare myself for betrayal.
Little nightmares is one of my most absolute favorite games, so happy to see another game is being made.
In all the excitement, lets not forget about the goat Runaway Kid. Moment of silence for him😔😔
If yall leave us on a cliff hanger without any explanation I swear
this is DEFINITELY gonna be a game with more focus on the worldbuilding. we're finally getting a large-scope image of the little nightmares world, and SO SO SO much can already be extrapolated from this trailer. for one, this setting was actually shown in the 2017 comics, meaning that we're getting a true vision of what the rest of the world looks like, outside of the influence of major players like the lady and the thin man. not only that, we're peering into how most children survive in the wild: judging by the dress of these characters, as well as how alone's (the one with the pigtails) wrench is clearly too big for her, they're scavengers! also, notice how their masks! they're travelers going through the desert, so they wear masks protecting their faces. much like all of the main characters in little nightmares, they don't wear shoes, which i'm starting to assume are a bit of a rare item, or perhaps not very good for stealth. i also want to say that it looks like they've been traveling together for a WHILE: they come into the city together and seem to cooperate moreso than mono and six, and the fact that the game is a co-op now seems to support that fact. i don't think there's going to be a betrayal like last game  so so excited for this game!!!!!!!!!
BROOOO THIS IS IS FIRE AF 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I can't wait to buy this game day 1 and love every second of it!
YESSSSSSSSSSSSS
Радостная новость, ждем релиза)))
IN 24?…..Oh no
New studio  hopefully they don't do a character assassination of Six or Mono I will riot!
Why is mostly of the people just lamenting because mono and six are gone and just doesn't get happy because this game is getting a continuation? 💀
I don’t really like it doesn’t have a little nightmares thing you could’ve made mono me runaway kid
this trailer is just so good for so many reasons.  1. the music is great already   2. it keeps the disturbing monster designs that little nightmares 1 and 2 had.  3. the new aesthetic looks great!  4. the new devs seem to know what their doing  5. seems to have a more diverse set of puzzles   honestly can not wait for this game!
I'm still salty aby Six and I'm glad she's not in the new game
https://youtube.com/@GamerCrack-sj4wf?si=hTMLjS9f99BlMwiF
Somebody call CoryXKenshin
Not that I'm not excited, but I'll remain cautiously optimistic until the game comes out. Giving the reigns of a franchise to a different dev team doesn't always work out, but maybe this time it will. Until then, I'll keep my expectations low.
ahhh omg im so excited, I fr cannot wait
すごい面白そう！楽しみ〜😍
Its been to long
Bro six will just show up in front of them use her lady power to make a ledge and grad there hand just to let go
Can six be in the game?
I will wait Daddy I will
I'm so freaking excited !
I hope this is online multiplayer 😔
This really reminds me of “9” especially with the outfits
It looks very cool I  like the new Characters!😆
Considering it kinda looks like the sun is rising this could mean this game will have a very special ending that might end the franchise or finish it
CK bangsat udah game ke 3 aja anjg gw game 1 Ama ke 2 aja belom kebeli
Little nightmares x Mad Max
DanTDM should recat to this for a video
Texas
охуеть ребятки норм анонс перед сентябрем приятно даже как то
IM SO EXCITED
This is gonna connect to the first 2, in some way, it has to
Oh I love the author Little nightmares are my heart
It was only 6 months ago I read that they was no plans for little nightmares 3. I love the series and I have littke nightmares 2 next to my bed for some reason.
I love the game I played the first and second game and it was good.
Oh my gosh yes
Six and Mono HAVE to come back
That ugly ass baby looking thing is nightmare fuel
YO THIS GAME IS GONNA BE LIT WHEN IT COME OUT WHO AGREES WITH ME!!!
Hype
Ok But where is mobile version you promised
I'm sad no six really? It's ok though
WE'RE MAKING IT OUT OF THE MAW WITH THIS ONE 🗣🗣🔥🔥🔥🥶🥶 IK ITS NOT THE MAW BUT WHATEVER 🗣🥶🥶🔥🔥
So glad to see Bandai keeping the franchise alive. The first 2 games are some of my favorites in terms of atmosphere and just overall style.
i love little nightmares
BRO THIS IS ACTUALLY SO COOL I CAN'T WAIT
If this is 2 player oh I'm going to love this
HELL YEAAAH
what a pleasant surprise to find in my recommended video feed. i really hope to get more lore on 6 after the events of The Maw.
I hope when these two characters uncover their masks they will be "six" and "mono"
Por fin !!! 😍😍😍 Aunque me hubiera gustado también que hubiesen sacado un Remake del juego de Little Nightmares que sacaron para móvil, hubiese estado genial jugar ese juego en la Nintendo o play/Xbox 😁
i thought they wouldnt release a third game? anyhow, im sure this is gonna be one of the most legendary horror game trilogy oat.
ITS HERE BOIIIIIS
HYPEEEEE
IM SO EXITED  YAYA
This game looks absolutely beautiful and very excited about it the only thing that I worried about is if the online affects the gameplay if someone wants to play it alone
I really hope they explain more about the Story and about mono and six.
Hell. Yes.
Oooh looks like we might be getting co-op
Yo they dropping little nightmares 3? I thought they stopped at 2
Feels like we might get more world biulding lore in this one wich is cool.
Wow new ship😮♥
😢😞 ? Моно, шестая чë с ними? 3 часть с другими как связана? 😥 я ожидал 3 часть как шедевр связаною с моно и шестой. Я  ожидал лучше. 😢Надеюсь сама игра будет лучше.
I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH AND I HOPE IT WILL NEVER END :c THANK YOU FOR CREATING THISS <3
Bro i thought they weren't doin another one. What a pleasant surprise!
LETS GOOOO IVE BEEN WAITING FOREVER
YEEEEEES
The fact that it just says "PC digital download" and not Steam worries me since it's on Unreal Engine. Also hope Six shows up at some point.
Hello dear developers, I ask you to return the old company so that they make the game no longer shit then you will have more profit (:
Hopefully one of these kids doesn't end up being betrayed by the other.
This video maked my day bro. Finally
Finally it become a series!   Hopefully we see Six and Mono again. Continue the story and let us know what happened to them.  My theory is that either Six or Mono going to be main villain.
I did not expect an announcement, gameplay and teaser trailer All in one. Well done BANDAI NAMCO let's be honest, this is a tease For all of us LN fans
They are already going to release 3 and they never released 1 for mobile devices ...
My favorite movie! 🤩
Let's go bro.!! I wonder if it's co op.??
THANK YOU HOW COME I FOUND THIS BY ACCIDENT
I really wasn't expecting this it looks amazing Let the nightmare continue!!
Cory have to play this
LETS FUCKING GOOOOO
OMG little nightmares 3 😱 im going to save all my money.

“THE LITTLE NIGHTMARES 3 TRAILER DROPPED GET IN HERE”
I can't wait!
I am happy to see a new set of protagonists, i am already predicting they are either going to bretray thenself or one of then will have to die at the end.
Ya'll think Mono and Six gonna make an appearance?
Best reveal of the show, cant wait for this.
Necesito jugarlo ya!!! 😍😍😍😍
LESS FUCKING GOOOO!!!!!

This little part is called happiness🥹
OMG ! Thank you guys 😍
IM SO FUCKING HAPPY?? LIKE WORDS CAN'T DESCRIBE THIS!!! LITTLE NIGHTMARES SAVED MY LIFE AND THIS IS GONNA BRING ME OUT OF MY SAD LIFE (then get betrayed again probably and go through the 5 stages of grief..) BUT FJXKNZNXIDDJDJSJ!!!!_(_+$!$+3 THANK YOU
Ну наконец то дождались анонса, единственное что настораживает что игру делают другие разработчики очень надеюсь что не испортят серию.
I want mono good ending 😢
Ive wanted to play a multiplayer little nightmares with my friend for years pLs tELL ME IT IS
Ok when this is an amazing game and you play through it, just stop and think about what gift from god that Tarsier would of made. This looks brilliant but just imagine if Dave mervik was involved.
Thank you so much Bandai for making this masterpiece of a game❤
AJDJQKDN YAY!!
YES I LOVE LITTLE NIGHTMARES SO MUCH!!!!
OMG FINALLY
OH MY GOD ITS HAPPENING STAY CALM!!!
Jord is screaming right now.
OMG
I CANT CONTAIN MY EXCITEMENT
I have to buy a new pc with good hardware to play this game 😢
this will be FUCKING MULTIPLAYER i guess
I have trust issues and i feel like alone and low are gonna betray each other
I need to know when !!
Nah, I got trust issues from the last one
ITS FINALLY HAPPENING :DDDD
I feel like these characters Represent Mono and Six in a way.
oh my god PLEASE I NEED THIS
It's probably NOT going to feel like the previous games, but I can't help but being super excited!
This is cooperative
As always - incredible sound design in this franchise 😍
YAY
AUHHH IM GONNA CRY I CAN'T BELIEVE THERE'S GONNA BE ANOTHER ONEE IM SO HAPPY
WOAH! I DIDNT EXPECT THIS!!
Can’t wait!!!
Omg this perfect
Im so excited and can't wait to play this. The music is super amazing and creepy. The clicking noises remind of when you knew white walkers from GOT were coming into the scene.
PLOT TWIST : They are wearing masks because they are another personality of mono and six.. remember my words haha
i can’t even express how excited i am
One of the best game franchise I've ever played!
A little nightmares game with a 16 rating?
hindi ko gets story nito.
Ugh it looks so gorgeous!!!
Finally
This time, good ending would be cool
This isnt the little nightmares I knew ):
I’m going to replay LN2 (since I didn’t get the chance to buy 1) right away
I'm hyped for this!!!
TAKE MY MONEY
Little nightmares is gonna be awesome
i love the little nightmares series! but im sceptical of this. they have new developers and a co-op feature, who knows if itll have the same effect like the others
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Ty
One word, whooooooooooooooooooooooooo!
Super excited this is awesome
nice loved the previous games
I think the giant one should be called mega baby
Estoy muy contento, esto es increíbleeeeeeee te amooo LN
Uhmm I hope this isn't Little Nightmares 3....
Why one of the characters looks like Cory 😂❤ I am so excited for this new series
WOOOOOOOOOo LITTLE POO POOS
Yessddshfjkf finally
okay so where the fucking traitor?
wonder if that mirror will be related to one in the comic's
Yes After 3 Years Is gonna release new game
ITS HERE IVE BEEN ON LITTLE NIGHTMARES SINCE 2021!!
AAAAAAAAA INCREDIBLE
Are those. New characters because. I like six 🙃😢but that's OK but is it 2 player???????
IVE BEEN WAITING 2 YEARS OMG I LOVE THESE GAMES, IM GONNA MISS MONO AND SIX BUT IM SO HAPPY THAT THERES NEW CHARACTERS
I'M LITERALLY SO EXCITED BC THIS IS ONE OF MY COMFORT GAMESSS
Nice! So who will be the characters this time?
does anyone know if this game will be in 4K HDR (to really harness the power of next gen gaming)
Ура дождались!
I hope that this is multiplayer, because me and my brother love this series and were very disappointed when they missed out on that opportunity in Little Nightmares 2
So now we can either play as a ginger or CoryXKenshin
Looks nothing like Little Nightmares, lost all essence
I have mixed feeling about this,i hope this game gonna be good as previous entries because it’s the first game under different studio and i also hope the coop doesn’t ruined the game feels
cool I hope mono will be there😊
Do you guys think we will get a happy ending this time?
Excited.
I’m so excited for this!!!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Amazing i can’t wait 🎉🎉😻
FINALLY. No six or mono sucks though
I made a fan art design of a boss for little nightmares 3. It was a sack full of possessed limbs and a eye sticking out. So when i saw those arm comeing out that pipe i got hyped as shit.
This is an interesting path of playing as new characters. I'm interested to see their relation to the story and I wonder if we will see Six and Mono later on?
Tarsier Studios is not part of this project :(  i hope it will be good anyway...
LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!   I NEVER THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE A 3RD GAME but I'M GLAD I WAS WRONG!
I was worried for a second that the new desert setting was going to hurt the vibe at first, but then I saw the freakish gigantic toddler doll and felt bad for ever doubting Little Nightmares.
Oh shit it’s co-op now. I’m going to love this a lot
I want to know how will this tie into the little nightmares universe and how does it connect with the story we already have ?? So many questions 😞😞😞
Okay I am Sold!
Played the second game about 4 times never getting tired of it and seeing this im so happy i might need see a doctor i cant take my smile away
YOOOOOOOOOO
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MaCJZIBKGs
дааааа блять
AAAAAAAAAAAAA!!! I screamed out loud when I saw this. I was waiting for this.
What's with the characters? Did they escape from Chernobyl!? Please tell me this is just a stupid joke!
IM SO EXCITED! Though I will miss Mono and Six I'm excited to see where this takes us! 2024!!!!!!😼😼😼😼😻😻
I love their new designs, it seems like this time it’s way more forward in time, meaning the whole “moon and six” thing is out of the way, AND WE NOW HAVE LOW AND ALONE!!!1! I’m super excited.
Wow
شكله الجزء الجاي يختلف عن الجزئين الي قبل
I'm not sure if Mono will come back, but I'm pretty confident Six will be in this game. The hum at the end of the trailer is too deeply rooted in Six's story.  Maybe they want to start using it as the theme of the franchise going forward, but the tune is too important to Six's narrative in games 1 and 2,  and if its going to be present in 3, its probably going to have to relate to Six in someway.  Also, all the mirrors in the trailer probably aren't a coincidence lol
OMG, I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR SO LONG! LOOKS SO GOOD!
ДА, МЫ ДОЖДАЛИСЬ!
A little bit too bright 🤏not very used to 😶
Absolutely amazing
I love how different the atmosphere looks for this game compared to the others. Its really gonna give it a unique identity among the other games in the series.
Pls have sixs dead body in the game
I feel like they might be saving a secret part for six or mono
i just cant wait
Hope this will take way longer than previous chapters to complete the game.
can't wait for mad max boss fight in little nightmares game :/ oh never mind this is not little nightmares 3 anyways... can't wait for dark souls 4 made by ubisoft, that's gonna be lovely experience <3
Yeaaaaah!!!!
Supre
Is it just me or this Game needs a coop?
haha cant wait for cory to play this.
Nome dei protagonisti è lo quello con la maschera da corvo e alon quella con la maschera da sub
Gamerjoob has to see this
Я наконец дождался,это случилось
YES YES YES YES YES YES !!!!!!!!!!!!!
Why the new character!? Why didn't you continue with the story from 1 and 2?
AT FIRST I WASN'T SURE THEY'D MAKE A 3RD ONE CAUSE I SAW THAT ARTICLE ABOUT A JOB AD 'CONFIRMING' THEY'D MAKE A 3RD ONE AND I WAS LIKE "Yeah but... Might not be..." AND THEN MY FRIEND SENT ME A TWITTER POST CONFIRMING IT, AND NOW I'VE SEEN THIS AND I'M SO EXCITED KRBEDJDN!!!!
This is a really pleasant surprise. For those saying six might be the villain, maybe but not necessarily. When she got her powers in LN1 she only killed the monsters and spared the nomes(aka the children). She's done both good and bad things, she's not a hero or villain, her character is neutral. She might actually help these two protagonists if she's feels like it.
Oh my god  So good Wonder how this first in the lore tho
Six' theme and a smoky mirror? I think somebody may be back...
This looks perfect! But the only things that don't look like they fit in is the main characters and the giant baby. I think the main characters' glide mechanic doesn't fit in but I like the new things but for the baby, I think it just looks too normal. You expect something more grotesque I guess. But even if they're going for "since everything is so twisted the normal one is the scariest" like how they did with the lady, I don't think I get the message
kinda upset six and mono isn't there but I'm excited at the same time
There’s gonna be a twist at the end and it’s not gonna be treachery calling it now
Seeing alone pull low up is giving me war flashbacks of mono and six 💀
the best cartoon horror game ever.
I almost fainted from excitement when I saw this... at first I didn't believe it, but when I knew it was real... I almost fainted.
Its not the same as it was😢 i want to know what happend to six and mono
Really cool I kinda hope that they may bring back some of the character from very little nightmares as I think they deserve more spotlight like the pretender as she only had 8 minutes or less of screen time.
Guess 2 wasn’t enough
Im hyped as hell
I’m excited…… but I dunno…..something feels off……it doesn’t say Tarzier Studios……isn’t the original creator in charge……I don’t know how to feel
Die werden immer hässliger, sonst geiles Game.
It's always a mirror. It's Always A Mirror.
А где обещание что новых частей не будет, и то что даже 4 года не прошло
YES!! FINALLY!! I was hoping we would get another installment for one of my favorite horror games and I am so happy and excited, can’t wait!!
As much as i love 6 and mono it is about time for a new story these 2 seem like siblings
Dude I’m stoked
マジで嬉しい。 ありがとうございます。 楽しみで仕方がない。
Wait, Tarsier studios is not making it? I am concerned. But I’ll try to be hopefully optimistic.
The mirror motif has me convinced that Six will be the villain after taking The Lady's place at the end of part 1.
IM SO EXCITED!!!!
will it be like Little Nightmare 2 cause I feel it won't be like the previous version?
No way...
Bro I can’t play opbr game on my ios6 😢my ID LUFFYtaro plzz fix it
Number 9 aesthetic i love x3 mirror men and wind of the nord
Well that's terrifying
Looks like its continuing on or adding to the lore of the comic ?
OH MY GOD!!!! SOMEBODY PLEASE PINCH ME!!! THIS HAS TO BE A DREAM!!!!
couch co-op ???
yes!! thank you so much bandai namco and supermassive games
Also, it can be played in multiplayer!
I hope that III will have dynamic cutscenes!
I've never been more hype for a game in my life
Omg, its coming soon
So we've been to creepy ships, kitchen, prisons, schools, hospitals & cities. Now we're in a creepy circle, theme park and dessert.  Little Nightmares thoroughly cover all the basis. Very good.
I’m so happy
(ﾉﾟ0ﾟ)ﾉ→ . Omg it's coming soon
Art direction is a little bland, but I loved 1 and 2 so I'm interested in how this will turn out.
Hype !
私はとてもこの発表を神だと思います 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
who r these 2 new characters?
😃😄
I recently played little nightmare 2, and I thought that little nightmare 3 would be more likely)) and here's such great news backed up by a trailer) Guys, you're the best, great game, keep it up!!! I'm waiting to play with pleasure
If this is coop I totally gonna play this with my girlfriend I think she into these games maybe.
No way bro……
OOOOHHHHH
It looks amazing, but I feel that they are risking the story a lot, I know that many can't stand Six anymore but they need to answer several things about her, if she does not appear in the game and it is an adverse story it would not make much sense.
Oh men another BANGER 💪
Hope we have co-op play
The ridiculous amount of joy I feel right now is incomprehensible, and I can't wipe the stupid grin I have I my face, oh snap I'm excited for this 🎉
My theory is that the protagonists are going to break the mono and six loop, why is there a mirror and in the background the smoke released by the lady, added to the fact that some parts seem to have already been seen in the pale city In addition to the fact that some parts also seem to be from the hospital, the school, and the maw Or it could be that the game is set in a little nightmares comic because I remember a comic in which mirrors disfigured children or also the north wind comic but I think that at this point my theory is already too far-fetched and meaningless
OMG THIS IS WHAT IVE BEEN WAITING FOR!!! I CANNOT WAIT FOR THIS!!!
I hope we get at least some closure for mono and six
Bandai Namco.. Please remastered swordcraft story with extended graphic and story..,   It will success and bring you money..
Real
完全なる神ゲーの予感がします。本当にありがとう
i've been waiting for this for so long. little nightmares is my favorite horror series of all time, and i cannot wait.
This is so cool!
0:33 could these be the guests?
I'll miss Mono and Six those two will always have a special place in my heart. But I'm super excited for this, and those two are adorable, hopefully nothing bad happens to them.....
VAMOOOOOOOOOOOOOS YO SABIA LA FE LA FE
What?!  Omg i really love this game but ... Where is six and mono😦😢
Omg i can't believe this is real im so excited😄
I could of SWORN y'all said there wasn't gonna be a little nightmares three, but im so hyped for it
this popped up on my news feed and i had to record a voice memo of my reaction because i may never be this shocked again. i am SO HYPED!!!!
Also am I the only person who think they learned their lesson from last time and decided to make this game co-op bc from what we’re seeing it looks like two people can play both characters👀
six will come back?
Hell...yes!!!
I can't wait! Ive been a huge fan of the games ever since i could get my hands on a copy of them. I enjoyed the puzzles and the atmosphere of the game and the story of each was amazing.   I especially cried out in the DLC with the runaway child. Ending completely unexpected.  I am for sure going to buy the game. I think i enjoy the series because it reminds me of portal series.
im excited for some new confusing lore
I’m so excited for this game! I fell in love with the first two games I can not wait for this one!!!!
This is AMAZING!!!!!!!!! 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ I CANNOT WAIT! But.... I will because Bandai Namco needs time to create the game itself! So, I will wait for them to finish!
I wonder if this is the same story line or a different one when this one comes out I'm gonna play all of them in order
Im so exited ijust hope suppermassive games dont screw it
I hope six and mono comes back i hope to have the ghost kid 👻  as a DLC i hope there new comics too
i’m so exited can’t wait for it 😭💗💗
The crow got to be evil we seen the crow everywhere
ありがとうありがとうありがとうありがとうありがとうありがとうありがとうありがとうありがとうありがとうありがとうありがとうありがとうありがとうありがとうありがとうありがとうありがとうありがとうありがとうありがとう
This game looks like its more gameplay focused, wich i normaly would not like for ln, but for Multiplayer it makes sense
MEU DEUSDSS NAO ACREDITO FINALMENTE 😭😭😭😭😭
I AM SO READYYY!
Please be a sequel to the first one.
Genial 👌
Finally the Legendary Game is back 🥰
ufffffffffffffff
This  is the most comforting horror game
As long as the sound track is on par with LN2 then I’m good.
🤔I am happy about the announcement of this game that I expected a third part, only the only thing that I did not quite like is the design of the characters, as the hats they wear do not fit because one looks like a clown and the other with a nose of a bird... In my opinion it looks bad, only in that detail, otherwise it's fine.
Thank fkn Goddddd this is happening! I had heard that a 3rd wasn't even going to happen. This looks intriguing! 😍
Calling it now, Six will be the main villain for this one.
Nintendo Switch ?
ONFG IM BOUT TO CRYYYY
I hate these games
Okay we got two new characters and I don't know their names so imma them rags and crow or praggy cuz the plague doctor mask
HECK YES IM AM SO HAPPY!!! Tho, I will be disappointed if six doesn't show up, She is practically the face of the game at this point.
AHHH se ve super bien, esperare con ansias el día de su estreno 💞
OMGGGG
Can’t wait.
OMG! One of my favorite franchises 😍
im calling it right now;  THE KID IN THE GREEN OUTFIT IS SIX (jokes, unless) & Baby is the Fat Kid.  Fat Kid lollipop is show at 0:46 & on Bandai Namco's Official LNIII biography page.
Niceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Please. Please let us know what happened to Six after The Maw. If 2 really is a prequel, this is definitely a sequel to the first game.
Count me  in.
LETSSSS GOOOOOOO, words cannot describe how excited I am for this
Can't wait to hear some new horror music and new piece of the Nowhere
Seeing the Crows and the mirror, I think about the North Wind and the Mirror Man
IM SO HAPPY THIS IS OUT 😭🙏🙏
А так хотелось увидеть шестую и моно. Но будем надеятся что новые герои нас не подведут. Будем ждать с нетерпением.😎👍
I still keep my hopes up every day for this game and no matter little nightmares is still in the bottom of my heart one of the most amazing games I have played.    Now Im hearing the new sound of nightmares and its great.   Thanks for making this game series bandai namco.   Also Im going to try to buy it on launch.
Por favor una versión coleccionista para Latinoamérica también está vez 🥹
Thought it’d never happen. Great to see!
Omg I can’t wait I’m obsessed with these game
THANK YOU.
Will gladly buy an enhanced physical native PlayStation 5 full price trilogy collection Bandai!
blatant copy paste from my a comment on a different video, but i’m really hyped for this, i just hope it lives up to expectations. i am kind of worried that there doesn’t seem to be any huge twists on gameplay so far. the thing that made 2 so exciting was the opportunity to have 2 characters together and interacting; so far, it almost feels like a reskin with a different environment and characters, not to mention the different developers. then again, this trailer was fairly small. maybe i’m worrying for nothing.   i’m really curious to see if we’ll the return of any previous characters. mono and the runaway kid’s fates are set in stone in seems, but six’s is a lot more open as to where it could go and theory’s as to what exactly she is and what she does after the first game. something that would be interesting to see would be our cannibalistic little friend as an enemy, rather than an ally. we’ve seem over and over again that she isn’t a very good person, and her interesting appetite doesn’t lend well to allies. it would be spooky to see her acting as the antagonist, considering we know just how well she fits into that role; a myth children fear and speak in hushed tones about. i like her a lot, and she’s one of my favorite characters.  i really hope this turns out as well as it has the potential to; and the new environment and protagonists are cool and this could be a wonderful addition to this series. in the meantime, i wait in anticipation. :)
Siiiii mi juego favorito ❤❤
no Mono or Six but the change in aesthetic and returning and new monsters looks so cool cant wait
этого мы ждем
Is a AI partner or is it a choice to have AI or multiplier?
SAY YOU SWEAR TO GODDDDDDDD YEEEEEEESSSSSSS
MY GOD I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS! New characters, villians, music, locations, mechanics & much more!  Seems the Lady's Mirrors are back! Notice how the new characters went through the mirrors at 1:03?!  I'm just hoping that the OG storyline will be what Tarsier Studios had intended.
What an intrigue, the game looks very good. I know you won't let me down, as Little Nightmares is my favorite game. I can't wait to buy it!
IT LOOKS LIKE SHIT
who is developing this game ?
Let's goooooo
I like to see that Little Nightmares has become a franchise that has won the hearts of all gamers in the world. I really look forward to seeing that twisted little world of little nightmares expand in this new game.
This basically just look like a reskin of Little Nightmare 2 honestly.
Took them long enough.
私的にリトルナイトメアは自分でやらず配信者の実況見てた方が面白い！！
It’s here it’s coming baby when you think something about to end it comes back

I’m so excited for this
Amazing. It's like it's 2017 and I'm nine years old again.
Maybe it is mono but a different style ??

kinda sad there’s no mono and six but I CANT WAIT FOR THIS GAME TO RELEASEEEEE
Wow! This looks great! I really like the plague mask I think its pretty fitting for some theories and just cool. It's a very interesting idea to have 2 characters right off the bat (it almost feels like two street kids kind of thing) I KNOW people are going to whine about not having Six or Mono but think about it; in Very Little Nightmares we played as the Girl in the Yellow Raincoat, in the DLC we played as the Runaway Kid, these were brand new characters to us just as Mono was when we first played. Until we played the first game even Six was unknown to us. I think this looks like it's going to be great just the aesthetics look amazing. its also interesting to see the SUN! If you look back, Little Nightmares 1 & 2 have almost no sunlight. Lol I can't wait! 🥰
Hopefully no one gets betrayed like in little nightmares two lol
After this, we need Ori 3.
Finalmente Little-Nightmares vai voltar a vida ❤
This is mighty convenient; I only just got the first one after putting off getting it, and now I have a 3rd one to look forward too! Can't wait! 👍
I hope the new mirror mechanic brings something new to the table and isn’t just a reskin of the tv traveling mechanic from the second game
TwT I thought this game is give up for make T-T So it's was a lies ?! 0-0 Like from the twitter/Reddit ?!
A theory of mine, I hope there’s a dlc that goes on this or sum.   Raincoat Girl (Reina/lady’s daughter) first escapes the Nest and then the story of LN2 goes on where we don’t see what’s going on with her, and then in LN1 she’s seen as flashlight girl by RK and loses it, soon becoming a NOME   In the nome disco room where we can see the shadows of the nomes as kids they used to be, one of the nomes off to the left (if you shine your flashlight at her) has the same shadow/silhouette as Reina! .
IM SO EXCITED!!! I absolutely LOVE little nightmares! You can tell.
i'm so excited! i don't care what the price will be i'm so buying this when it's out!
Return to Nowhere? No thanks. i hated driving through Nebraska.
Nooo i want six and monooo i want to know they story and more games and...WHERE IS TARSIER STUDIOS😢😢😢
Are any of the original devs working on this game?
This was posted on my first day at a new school so thanks for giving me something positive to look forward to
ITS HAPPENING, EVERYONE STOP PANICKING, STAY CALM STAY CALM

YEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSS, THANK YOU!!!
I really hope it lives up to what Tarsier Studios can make
NAO CREIO 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
"I know gonna happen that girl leave behind guy again, it's ____." 😢😢😢

Screaming hitting walls hyperventilating This will be my new hyperfixation.

PFFFFFT HELL YEAH
Spooky
Wow this is like little nightmares in wasteland hopefully those new kid will survive
LITTLE NIGHTMARES IS BACK🎉
E
MY BLESSING HAS BEEN ANSWERED
Yeyeyess
CAralhouuu EU TO MUITO HYPADA
Yo I didn't expect to see 6 and 7 from the movie Nine in here!
Nice
Let us pray there is no tragic betrayal
I would have loved to see any connection to the previous parts. This looks really different except the gameplay. 🤷‍♂
IM SO HAPPY I DIDN’T THINK THEY’D BRING IT BACK AAHHEOFNOSNFKJ
OOOOHHHH MY GOOODDD!!
英語版とはいえバンダイなんで正しい情報じゃないんですかね？知らんけど
Really excited for LN3, and just finished the first podcast episode. Hopefully no one will be betrayed in this game, and maybe we can see a glimpse of what happened to Six after she escaped the Maw(if this is actually a sequel). I also like the new atmosphere of the game. Here’s a fun fact: after LN2 came out I thought of what the next game could look like, and the first idea that came to mind was a carnival, and looks like we are getting a carnival. That’s quite the coincidence. Anyway, if anyone from Bandai Namco is reading this, I would like to make a personal request to ask you guys if you could maybe give a shot at a Little Nightmares VR. I think that would be both awesome and terrifying for everyone. It wouldn’t have to be a whole new game, maybe just a port for the first one. But anyway that’s it really excited and make sure to take your time, we will all wait patiently.
本当に本当に嬉しい！！！もう新作は出ないものだと思ってたので…本当にありがとうございます！！ 楽しみすぎる😭✨
a multiplayer Little Nightmares game? Now that's something i never knew i needed.
I swore it was canceled ahahahahahahaahhahhahah
Still not gonna get use to have new main characters but i know the game is going to be awsome.
Omg they actually did it you guys, they actually did it!  I thought they'd stop making this Masterwork anymore, now hopefully this would be as good as the first and second one or even waaaay better.
They called me crazy for thinking this would ever happen. I am very excited to play this and so glad this series is still continuing. I loved LN 1 and 2 but I always wanted more from this beautifully terrifying world. So glad this is happening, will pick it up as soon as it drops!
Was kinda worried when Bandai Namco got the rights to LN. But if there plans is to turn the franchise into an anthology series, I’m down with that!
Wait, is that the giant baby from the concepts of LN II?
YOOOOOOIII
so excited for it to come out can't wait
ohhhhhhh my gooddd the trailer and incrible😯😯😯
I'm literally crying over this 😭😭
LITTLE NIGHTMARES III AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH I WAS JUST TINKERING WITH MY MY CUSTOM MUSIC BOXES THE PAST WEEK (which included Togetherness I, Old Friends Anew and Prison Toys). The new duo's outfits are a bit cluttered compared to yellow triangle Six and brown rectangle Mono. Glad the dollhouse camera was retained. Looking forward to new details, but am wary with it not being Tarsier Studios this time around.   Will Tobias Lilja be reprising for any of the soundtrack?
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I’m exited to find out more about the signal tower such as what it is and how it got there
今年一番の朗報。 シンマンの椅子っぽいのも見えるな。
YESS
Little Nightmares is my favorite game of all time, I’m so happy to see it’s getting a third installment.
I have to finish the first game Dlcs And LN2 Lol
ほんとに待ってた、シックスは登場するのかな？
Holy Sh*t, i didnt believed when i saw the thumbnail, thought its some fanmade trailer. I really thought it would never happen but here we are. So excited to see what this game will be like!!!
OMG IM SO FREAKING HAPPY AND EXCITED, YOU DONT KNOW HOW LONG IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
my favourite game dropping a 3rd installment on my birthday <3 best gift ever
I can’t wait man
本当に待ってた！ 楽しみすぎる！ 待っててよかった😂
OMG! It feels like a co-op!!! 😮😮😮
Omg my heart! So excited!
its back
lets hope no one get betrayed this time
the developers better be giving us a happy ending to the trilogy this time 😭
One of the best horror and mystery games in history High hopes are pinned on this segment
I was sad that Tarsier was no longer developing the franchise, but with this trailer, It looks like Supermassive have it in the bag.
I AM UNBELIEVABLY EXCITED 😆😆😆😆
i love this game series. Im glad they’re coming out with another one, i thought the second one would be the last😭
"There won t be a third part." Also Bandai Namco: "Look, we don t really care about any of that..."
Wait… the green one….  Is that PIGTAILS GIRL!? From the comics!?
*W H A T* *Y E S*
I’m crying that’s how happy I am You have no clue how much I’ve wanted this game
The best game series is coming out with another? lets gooo!! im so excited for this to release!!!!!
all we know is that its coming 2024. 😫 the wait is going to be long
Finally Finally
NO WAYYYYYYYYY
It looks good, but without Tarsier studios it’s not going to be the same. I’ll probably still prefer little nightmares 1 over both the games, with little nightmares 2 being in second place
No Tarsier studios has me pretty apprehensive.
Looks amazing The only horror game series that makes me want to play
155 people were sad Six wasnt here
Sad that's not Swedish developer anymore
Fake
LET’S GOOOO!!
Omg I love ❤❤❤
CAN’T WAIT FOR THIS THE LAST TWO GAMES WERE AMAZING
GIANT CREEPY BABY DOLL?! YESSSSS!!  CAN'T WAIT! 😄👍
Omg ! This took me ny suprise!! I've been a huge fan od little nightmares when it first came out ! I cant wait to Play this!!! Im so excited qwq
there will be beta
Woah this 3rd one looks awesome 😮
Omg
It's not LN, not without Tarsier Studios.
Dont know if I will like it without 6 and mono.  Little disappointing but worth checking out
I hope it will have a happy ending unlike two games. I hate them.
About time!
Meu jogo preferido tendo continuidade, to ansiosa
i CANNOT have my heart broken again PLSS
OMGMGMMG
I can already tell the soundtrack is gonna be phenomenal, i miss the cooler coler scheme but im excited to see the new environments! The end shot of the junkyard? Looks really good!
JESUS CHRIST I'M SO EXCITED. Little Nightmares means a LOT to me, I can't believe we are finally getting a new game in the franchise!!
Wait so this is not being developed by Tarsier? Why?
The imagery shown here gives me hope that LN3 will properly build on the lore Tarsier was working with in their games. The sand and wind stuff has been seen before in the comic and is a totally different entity to what was on the maw or in the pale city. This is the most exciting gamescom announcement for me
YES I WAITED SO LONG❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
YESSSSSSSS HYPE AF (⁠｡⁠♡⁠‿⁠♡⁠｡⁠)
Wait is it coop???
Yes, finally I wait so long a new little nightmares
AHH I'M SO EXCITEDD i was getting the chills the entire trailer
YESSSSSS🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Little nightmares is back...
Multiplayer our not? fine with both
Ah hell nah!  I'm not this game scar me again.
How odd that today the outfit i wore was a little nightmares themed outfit! And this came out?
I actually am super excited to see how they are going to correlate this new aesthetics to Mono and Six
CoryXKenshin has to return for this series!!!
yeeees finally
OMG 😱😱😱✨✨💕💕
Idk if it'll beat 2 or not...2 was really good
Whooo, I'm so excited about the return of my favorite game, the names of these new kids are unknown?
IM SO EXCITED THAT I CANT STOP SMILING LMAO IM FEELING A BURST OF HAPPINESS I LITERALLY SCREAMED WHEN I SAW THE NEWS
I'm so excited omfg!!! I won't be able to play it but I'll watch livestreams to find out the story so I don't mind lol 😂 This is my favourite game series I love it so much!!! This looks insane and even the trailer already gave me shivers!
I’m so excited for the this  it’s set in the daytime so it’s near when six has left the maw as when she left it was day
LETS UFUFKING GO
Hope to see Six again
If this game ends up being a massive disappointment, I can't forgive supermassive games for that.
I love how u moved on even without Tasiar Studios even if everyone else gives up on the game I won't.
This is crazy
i have the theory that this is game will explain the origin of north wind
Absolutely love Little Nightmares, can't wait for this one!!
Message from THE ISLAND: the pretender has returned... be prepared...
The new them is already a masterpiece
See? That's why I knew it! It can't be the end! We need to.stop the loop!
HOLY……AHHHH!!
OMG. IM ACTUALLY TEARING UP
it is coop
I love the whole new aesthetic as one of my favourite things about the last two games is how unique their environments are to each other. I can’t wait
Really hope that it doesn’t lose the intrigue of the world and horror created by tarsier I trust supermassive though, they do good horror
The art style, the atmosphere and the vibes! I love this game already!
WOOHOO 🎉
YOURE KIDDING?!?!?!!!!?!?!?
OMG OMG OMG FINALLYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
Aeeee finalmente
bro im playing 2 rn
I think I have a theories I think maybe the pigtailed girl is the girl with the spoon in the hospital in little nightmare maybe it is stupid but the pigtailed girl have the same hair colour than the spoon girl (or maybe I am just stupid)
There must be a co op!!!
LETS GOO
Okay, fun time --  New Sandy Dunes Environment/Locations throughout the trailer. nice 0:14 Clothes with no body and abandoned suitcases. connection to LN2 Pale City or something. 0:20 Again two characters. Ah shit, here we go again. Pls, don't break my heart this time. 0:23 Now here's a new menacing mirror with something to do with time ticking (main villain vibe). Also, Mirror was a vital part of LN1 and later in the trailer, it allows them to teleport into at 1:01, like in LN2 mono tv-travel thing. Overall I guess the mirror connects with both the game in some way. Also, the mirror is cracked. 0:29 Ability to fly us or maneuver mid-air. that's cool 0:36 Maybe a main boss is spotted here with multiple hands (just speculation, I might be wrong.) 0:55 Another main boss. (this one is sure one) And this guy's one eye is a light beam that seems freezing the player just like in LN1. 1:08 Location update - A dump yard or something, maybe an important location in the story who knows? 1:12 And finally the humming. So Six, you there?
I hope they have six or mono cameos! IM SO hyped for this game ahhhh I’ve waited in anticipation for so long
Was worried when the original devs couldn't work on this series anymore but Supermassive blew me away with this trailer! Good to know the series is still in good hands
IM SO EXCITED
I’m actually loosing my mind, this is so cool. As a huge fan of the series I’ve been waiting for this for ages! Can’t wait to play
I CAN'T WAIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I’m gonna have a panic attack  Holy shit! I love the little nightmares series! It’s my childhood
All of this is truly epic, I can't wait to play it!🤩
HOLY SHIT
THATS STILL HOW IT WAS BEFORE THANK YOU!!ALSO THEY LOOK SO SWEET
It looks like a 2.0 Mono and six And I love it
oh looks. An heart attack.....
I'M SO EXCITED OH MY GOD !!!!
This game almost has a sort of neo-industrial-dystopia type setting with the setpieces and designs, and while im not yet totally sold on the kid designs, i absolutely dig the tonal shift. Hopefully they add customization like the hats in LN2. Thats said, its little nightmares, so my wallet is already open and my money out.
GOAT GAME.
I was really surprised to see this, but HELL YEAH!!
Really looks like their stepping up their game they’re getting real ambitious tonight
Oh _shaaat!_
multiplayer?
Soooo...this is real?
Nadie me hará cambiar de opinion pero no me gusta este little nightmares porque no es la continuacion verdadera de lo que pasa con six o con mono o con Runaway kid aunque ya este muerto, Pero igual no me gusta😒 me gusta mas el little nightmares 1 y 2 🙄🙄 Y me la pela si les agrado el ultimo, en fin
Omfg since I completed ln2 I've been dreaming of a 3rd part and jesus chris my dream is coming true
IM EXITEDDDDDD
I like this diorama puzzle platformer series.
HVKAUFLGIABLJFVAUGRLJHFVJURADFV IM SO EXITED FOR THIS JHGSKUADFGKAUF
Oh my god, are they gonna make a 3rd game better than the two first ones?
Daaaaamnnnnnn....I want to play it now =<...it looks awesome!!!
I remember being heartbroken when Tarsier said they wouldn't be developing LM anymore as they were more interested in other projects (which no shame of course) and I was scared that the series would never be touched again after no DLC released for LM2 akin to the first game with the Runaway Kid.  Yet Bandai wasn't kidding when they said there'd be more games in the future regardless, glad they kept the rights. This new team seems to greatly understand the overall vibe and style, and I'm more than excited to see what they bring to the series. Best of luck to them, we'll be waiting patiently! <3
Meh. Mono and Six the classics 🤷‍♂️
I need it now!!!!❤❤❤❤
LETS GOOOOOOOO
Its not gonna make fun without six ☹
Multiplayer?!?!?!
Yall gotta hear the podcast
Low’s design is so cool! My favorite of the two already, I love their mask
The soundtrack had immediately stuck in my head, and it not even out yet 🤩
I haven't even played the game and I'm already in love with the soundtrack
Hopefully this runs good on switch💀 it probably will bc the prequel did very good
Nooooooooooo desde que lo cambiaron a otros desarrolladores ya no me gusta nadaaaaaa😭😭😭😭😠😠😠😠😠 prefiero mass el LITTLE NIGHTMARES 1 Y 2 q esta cosa q ni parece Little nightmares esas cosa gigantes q parecen bebés y esos personajes q ni los conozco q es ma una copia de mono y six ,ya no quiero nadaaa😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠yo me quedo con Little nightmares 1 y 2 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄
more Little Nightmares! if you keep making em, i'll keep buying em!
HOLY SHIT I WANT IT JET
Oh my fucking god, I love the first two games I think they Are the best, the horror genre Haß to offer. This is gonna be my game of the year.
Yes, another little nightmares. I’ve been waiting for this for a long time now.
Let's Goooooooooooo!!!!!!! The hype is real guys!!!!!!!! 😭
Very different but very exciting!
I swear I'll buy it as soon as it comes out
Image if at the end, all the games cross over or smg???? THAT WOULD BE AMZING
Finally something in years I already thought there was going to be nothing new and still have the audacity to postpone the launch for the next few years but it looks like it's going to be amazing
TAKE MY MONEY !!
I thought Tarsier would develop chapter 3... I hope Supermassive stays true to the original spirit
YEEEEEEEAAAAAAAH!!!!!!
I've been waiting for this!
I am a bit worried but I am as equally hopeful that this gonna be great, we'll have to wait and see.
HOLY CRAP THIS IS HAPPENING
Omg 😱 Yes! ❤
BRO MY LIFE IS COMPMETE, SONIC FRONTIERS UPDATE 3, SONIC SUPERSTARS, AND NOW THIS? IM CRYING I LOVE LJTTLE NIGHTMARES AND THIS DOESNT EVEN LOOK LIKE IT BUT IN SUCH A GOOD WAY, NEW CHARACTERS, NEW ATMOSPHERE, THIS IS BEAUTIFUK AND I WONDER HOW THIS WILL CONNECT THE PREVIOUS GAMES
WHAT
So Hype! Love these games Little Nightmares! This gonna be awesome!
YES YES YES :D
AAA
You guys said you'd never make another one😅 I'm happy you have though, I've missed that world
HOLY SHIT WHAT? I THOUGHT THE SERIES WAS OVER
the day has finally come
At 28: you can see a nome sitting on the ground left.
LETS GOOOO!!!!!
Can’t wait
WE WON GUYS OMFG🎉🎉🎉
YEEEEESSSSSS🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
I love this, but where is Six and my boy Mono
I hope it will continue LN 2 story
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
I didnt want this... i wanted mono and six back ): WELL IM STILL HYPED!!!!!
it really happened... I'm very happy, thanks for this announcement!
TRÊS?
there are several elements that scare me (and not in the way a game should scare) but i'm hopeful and i think a good thing will come
Уважение вам, за то что нестали использовать моно и шестую как гг или просто фоновых персов, единственная игра каторую я знаю, что не изменяет старый стиль игры а только дополняет его
This part is done by another developer, not the people who made the first and second parts. Whatever game comes out, anyway it will not be as good as the previous parts... :(
i hope this new studio continues the story and we can find a way to maybe even save mono or see 6 again. Im so happy ❤
Hype is real
NAHHH WE ARE SO BACK‼
OMG New soundtrack, hell yeaaaah!!!
Little nightmares developers if you reading this: thank you!!!!! This looks hella creepy :)
AAAEEEEEEEE CARAMBAA FINALMENTE 🥺😭😭😭 🎉🎉🎉  Tô muito animada para o que esse jogo pode mostrar, quero saber mais sobre esses dois novos personagens já que o Mono e a Six estão fora de cena!! :D
Hearing that humming at the end: instant goosebumps
It's not Little Nightmares Where's dark atmosphere of loneliness and children's fears?  Where's protagonists with no individulatity so everyone can put themselves into a game?  WHY THE DUCK YOU USED MONO'S MECHANIC AND REPLACED TV WITH MIRRORS?
mds ta voltando msm, uma das minhas séries de jogo favorita, tô mto ansiosa 😭😭💕💕
HOLY SHIT I'M FUCKING CRYING RN
My heart rn
Yyyeeeaaassssz!
Cant wait to play this! Love this game its so creepy and fun I always go back to playing the first and second part whenever I’m in the mood to be spooked hehe, I wonder what this storyline is going to be
Looks like a dusty salad of rehashed ideas. Mirrors from first installment - check. Two characters from the second - check. Basically, everything in this trailer is a rehash of ideas from previous games. Nothing, just nothing new. It was evident from Tarsier's statement that they won't making the third game because they no longer able (or at that specific moment, at least) to find new creative basis. But Namco says ''no''. Namco's bosses say ''let's milk it until it dies, just EA does'' without even slightest understanding what kind of artistic and narrative value carry original games and what creative vision Tarsier had in the first place driving the to create them. Namco - idiots.
supermassive games? no tarsier?
WOWOOWOQOWOWOOWOWOOW
what happened with Tarsier Studios
I can not wait to see what the game will be like
続編は作られないかもって言われてたから本当に嬉しい！！！！！ 既に待ちきれない！  ぼっちなので協力プレイ"対応"ってだけで"必須"ではないといいけど…
I have mixed feelings after watching this trailer ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
I'm so happy this is being made, it looked amazing. i'm tearing up a bit, but that's because i love this series
IM SO HYPED
MUCHISIMA GRACIAS POR NO DEJAR A LA GENTE D ELA GENERACION ANTERIROR COLGADAS Y NO DEJARLES CON UNA SAGA A MEDIAS EN SERIO MUCHISIMAS GRACIAS!!!! A LA ESPERA DE LA COLECCIONISTA PARA COMPRARLA Y MERCHANDAISING!
YOOOOO THIS LOOKS SO COOOL but it feels so different without Six in it, maybe she'll be the big bad villain lmao
Looks like this game will be on a much larger scale
You better tie that up with the existing lore or god help me
is it co-op or like the other ones ?
I do hope this new studio can pull a good game, Tarsier Studios had made both and has said they are done with the ip and hopefully this continuation isn’t a letdown. So far it looks ok.
After what feels like an eternity we finally get some news! Hopefully it still has that Tarsier feel to it.
LETSA FREAKING GOOOOOOOO
NO WAY IM SO EXCITED I DONT KKNOW WHAT TO SAY
LETS GOOOO🔥🔥🔥 I’m so excited!
i think they should rename it to something else because this is very much a game just heavily inspired by little nightmares, it has the aesthetic and whole feel of LN but it is such a different approach at this point
I cannot fucking wait holy shit
NO FUCKING WAY 💀💀💀
Oh my god. Its been an era guys but their finally back!
Bro, what the heck, it looks awesome, i love the aesthetic and the new characters look so cute
I actually remember someone at the last Universal Orlando Halloween Horror Nights I went to, 2021 to be precise, that the team behind the first two Little Nightmares, which looking at this trailer I am sure he meant Tarsier Studios, wouldn’t develop a third one. To reinforce that claim, only Supermassive’s name seems to be credited in this trailer. But to be fair, Supermassive has shown to be a rather competent studio. Sure they are most known for developing story based cinematic adventure games and as far as their involvement in the Little Nightmares franchise goes? They developed the Enhanced Edition for the most recent entry. Still, I don’t think this is a case where the sequel to a highly anticipated game is given to a studio that doesn’t understand the IP. Looking at the trailer, the game looks great, and like I said, Supermassive has been shown to be rather competent, so I will at least keep my fingers crossed!
This is amazing news!!!
in 1:04 you can hear the mirror breaks , and the soundtrack is SOO GOOD
I hope the games turns out good, i dont the new aesthetic sadly ( i don't feel that oppression that i feel in the first two games) i really really dont make me play with another person.
couldn't save it for the game awards but thank you
I hope that the third part will have a night atmosphere
I love this game!!!
He esperado 25 años para este momento ❤
I literally shat my pants when I saw this!!!!
¿Y para cuándo el Little Nightmares 4? 🗿🚬
SO FUCKING READY
Will this game available on Xbox game pass?
Cool another LN game to speed run, only thing that throws me off is WHERE IS SIX, she's been every other game so where is she
😶is this real😮yes!🤑
You can definitely tell this isn't made by the same people, but not necessarily in a bad way. It looks absolutely great! A bit worried it's releasing in 2024 since that's less development time than the rest, but based on what we've seen, I'm still confident it's going to be a fun time. Also sidenote, I love these new character designs! Even more than Six and Mono.
This is looks so good, I love the aesthetic and the designs of the characters! I'm glad the trailer isn't relying on Mono or Six to get people hyped because this alone looks amazing (if they're even a part of this story to begin with, idm personally). I can't wait to see what the finished product looks like
I hope this is the sequel for the little nightmares one cause 2 was the prequel to 1 i hope that we will get answers about the thin man and six even if they are now not the characters
I always believed that one day or another, little nightmares 3 would have been announced. So hyped 🔥🔥🔥
The story is only gonna get more complicated but I’m all here for it
My patience was not in vain!!! OMG IM SO EXITED!!
UNBELIEVABLE! It will definitely be an amazing sequel to Little Nightmares!!! I'm really looking forward to playing this game! It has very different artwork from previous games, and these similarities From the mirrors of Little Nightmares 3 with the "North Wind" comic It's Driving Me Crazy! Can't wait for more news!  -You are Amazing Bandai Namco!
YOOOOOOOOOOO Btw, hello to all coming from the Little Nightmares Amino :D
THIS WILL BE AMAZING
WTF? This is reality?
We need more games like this.. and limbo/inside..
Cautiously optimistic, (cautious seeing as it’s not Tarsier working on it this time), but looks awesome. Here’s to hoping!
This looks amazing!
I hope they meet Salim there
@thekareka اجهز يا جميل
i mean even if is most likely that will have connections with the previous games, i like how they are expanding the world of little nightmares and not just focusing on the stories of the maw and the pale city, and i can't wait to see all the story in this upcoming game!
One of the best series returns in 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I don’t care what people will say about this game , I’ll treasure the soundtrack and the series forever
Yoooooooo yes!!!!!!! Is back!!!!!!
BRO I'M SO HAPPY I LOVE LITTLE NIGHTMARES SO MUCH.
LETS FUCKING GO
من أفضل سلاسل الألعاب عندي
Knowing that the Little Nightmares franchise gave us freights, shivers and shocks, I completely think Six will be back. Six has been in all the games so far (even a minor role in the Very Little Nightmares and being the main reason why TRK/Seven is ded). Six was here from the beginning, so it's possible she won't let it end without her.
I'll buy it but I swear if you do that "thing" you did in the last game I swear I'm never trusting you again.
THE GAMEPLAY THE MUSIC JUST EVERYTHING YES
Yo. This is exciting, Little Nightmares is back again in 2024. Getting the Xbox Series X version.
HOLY SWEET MOTHER OF MERCY ITS HAPPENING
YES! 🎉🎉🎉🎉 yes!!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
cant believe it, the 3rd chapter of my favorite game ..
Ура❤ждём ❤❤❤
Hope its co-op.
A nice surprise to be sure!!! I got to be honest. A lot of company's are changing their franchises too much. Handing them over to bigger company's but since a new company took over for Little Nightmares, I thought the same would happen. Yett when I get to see this trailer, I LOOVEEE the direction their going in. Great job to the new developers of LN!! 😄
IM SO EXITED ITS RETURNING AFTER SO LONG
This might be 2 players
Я дожила....😢
This looks amazing! Ive loved this franchise since 2017 and im super excited for this! I also think why the kids are wearing weird stuff like a mask and (I think that's a hazmat suit?) Is because they're just finding stuff wherever and just taking it so the won't be cold like six took the raincoat even though it left her legs exposed, since it was better than the dirty suit she was wearing.
I’m guessing this is the origin of the lady from little Nightmares 1! I can’t wait for this to come out!”! 🎉🎉🎉🎉
ME AND ONE OF MY CLOSEST FRIENDS MET BECAUSE OF A ROBLOX LITTLE NIGHTMARES FANGAME I’M SENDING THIS TO HIM IMMMEDIATLY
Oh man, this looks incredible. I hope these 2 make it but in Little Nightmares universe.. can’t hope too much :(
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS, I love this series !
This looks awesome!
LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO, can't wait. Seems we will have new characters this time instead of Mono and Six. hmm when they come back?
*Sees LN3 Trailer I’M SO EXCITED *Sees kid with a bird mask I’M EVEN MORE EXCITED
I NEVER WANT THIS FRANCHISE TO END!
Maaan we better get some answers 😭😭
This should be good.
I just played both of the games and my friends and I were just talking about a possible 3rd game! This our wish come true
PLS! no exclusive epic games
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE HOW SIX SCREW EVERYTHING UP
Take my money immediately I need more of this universe
I know this sounds odd but I had actually predicted Little nightmares 2 and now 3 years before they were even announced and this was back in either 2017 or 2018, I had them as a joke on my class art portfolio but it would eventually turn out that my joke about a Little nightmares 2 would end up being true as you (Bandai Namco) announced Little nightmares 2 and now my joke about Little nightmares 3 is coming true, well since my previous two predictions came true I'm going to say the other jokes that might come true, on my class art portfolio (the same one I had made a joke about Little nightmares 2 & 3) I made a joke that there be a Little nightmares 4 & 5 so fans of Little nightmares (and Bandai Namco) let's see if my joke of a Little nightmares 4 & 5 will come true later in the years to come (4 & 5 on my class art portfolio were mostly just a joke when I drew them as I thought that the idea of there being 4 or 5 Little nightmares games would be too ridicules), oh btw Bandai Namco I didn't see Six in the trailer does this mean her story is done or will she eventually appear in somewhere in Little nightmares 3?
MY FAVORITE SERIES IS BACK LETS GO
Looks incredible!
I CAN’T WAIITTTTTT! Hopefully it keeps the charm the other two games had. It’s an interesting aesthetic that isn’t exactly similar to the other 2 games
OUR DREAMS OF NIGHTMARES HAVE COME TRUE!!!
Here I go again...
LEZGOOOOOO
I CAN’T BELIEVE MY EYES
Finalmente, espero não me decepcionar
WHAT I thought LN wasn't coming back what I'm def excited but holy hell, this surprised me! Editing: ok I remember now, the dev of 1 and 2 weren't returning with one, so new devs? Either way I am excited!!
OH. OH. THIS IS SO COOL
OMG OMG OMG MY FAVOURITE HORROR FRANCHISE IS COMIN BACK. YAHOOOO. FINALLY! I AM DRINKIN TONIGHT 🎉
Im so hyped rn
WHAAAAT
Wow it's going to be really crazy new puzzles too bad it's only going to launch in 2024😢
Oh my goodness! Yes yes yes yes yes! Oh my goodness, we're gonna get more rap songs from JT, more incredible fan art, already we got some terrifying & creepy enemies. I am so glad & happy Bandai are continuing with this! Oh, yes yes YES!!!!
OMG THIS DID NOT JUST DROP   I'm gonna be honest.. It's not the same and nothing will ever beat Tarsier but I hope it's atleast kind of good
THE FACT THIS SEEMS TO FOLLOW A WHOLE NEW STORY AND TWO NEW KIDS MAKES ME EVEN MORE INTRIGUED, I'M SO EAGER TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THE UNIVERSE OF LITTLE NIGHTMARES!
Palls, after 3 years , we won.
Me happy
OMG PLS TELL ME YOUR NOT JOKING
Voy a verlo aunque se que no va a ser lo mismo por que como el mismo creador dijo "si algo mas sale de esta franquisia nosotros no tenemos nada que ver con ello, nosotros ya contamos la historia que queriamos contar"
LET'S GO
First, The Maw, an underwater facility, then The Pale City, a rotten and deformed city, now we're gonna have a dessert-like village or a factory. I enjoyed both games and can't wait for this one, and it seems mirrors have something special like in the second game with the tvs, since they teleported through a mirror (just like with the tvs) and bro, the giant baby looks creepy as hell.   Edit : There something really curious, the crow masked boy is called “Alone” and the word “Mono” is also referred to “Monophobia” aka fear of being alone, and since they both can teleport trough TVs or mirrors, maybe these characters are linked in any way?
Cant wait to explore this stunning world ❤
When the world needed then most they returned and so far still looks absolutely gorgeous. Even if Six and Mono are sadly out of the picture, that still doesn’t mean that these new characters and monsters will still give us an experience that is the definition of Nightmares.
The Nightmares continue.....
So they really not gonna tell us what happen to six and mono😭
Can’t wait for Little Nightmares 3, love this series!
AAAAAAAAAAA THIS IS THE BEST DAY EVER
Oh yes.. oh yes...
OMG NO WAY!! I've loved little nightmares since the first game and I'm so excited it's back, even if it doesn't feature either of the previous protagonists
¡Tremendo!
Holy shit it’s official
I love little nightmares and I was never expecting this🥹
Co-op????
LETS GO!, I Hope Supermassive Knows what there Doing and Doesn't Ruin the Franchise!
I’m glad little nightmares is back but I am praying that they will be able to pull it off without tarsier studios..hope they don’t ruin such masterpiece of a series
Glad this is being made after the developers said they were finished with little nightmares
Hope I'm in this one!!
I think Mono will meet Six again...
HELL YEAH !!!
Yes. Let's do this!😎 Thanks to anyone who reads this.
OMG WE ARE EAAAAATING THIS YEAR MY DUDES
Nome 0:28
OH MY GOD FINALLY!!!
This looks like it actually could be a full two player with how good both players are moving and both holding items but that's just me hoping
AAAAAAAAAAA + GAME :D
i'm ready to be hurt again.
Fuck yes!!
I did not expect this announcement. I thought without Tarsier we would never see another.
JUST YES
OMG HELPPP IM SO HYPED IT'S THE BEST GAME
I love Little Nightmares but I'm kinda concerned about the main characters. I hope they're as good as Mono and Six were.
Moi qui aime cet série je vais apprécier celui ci hâte de revoir Six a moin qu'ils sont nouveau
LET'S GO
Mono is the best protagonist but he is a villain in end of little nightmares 2 , mono and six return in little nightmares 3 ???
LET'S FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
does anyone else get little big planet vibes from the little nightmares series?!
tbh this feels like the only Ln game that doesnt get the other character taken away but istg if i see another betrayal
This is a surprise and a little unexpected by me.
❤
Oh my!! Oh my!!! waiting for it since a freaking looooong time! :)
My little prayers have finally been answered!!!!
I wonder which character will betray the other 😪
TOO EXCITED, I’VE REPLAYED ALL THE OTHER GAMES SO MANY TIMES
SOMEBODY GET CORY!!!!!
OMG IM CRYING OMG OMG I LOVE LITTLE NIGHTMARES WITH ALL MY HEART OMG OMGOMG
OH MY OH KY GOTFOD OH MY GOD OH MT FOD OH KT FOS UESS
I can't believe what I just saw. This was something I didn't expect to see.
LETS GOOOOOOOOO i'm so fricken excited!!!
I'M SO EXCITED FOR THIS! I CAN'T WAIT!
WAAAH I CANT BELIEVE IT, IM SO EXCITED!!!
یکی از بهترین بازی های مورد علاقه من😍
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
I wonder who the final boss is going to be in the first one it was the lady which alot of people knew in the second one people thought it was the thin man but it was actually six so they could trick us again i think that it my be six or mono because six seemed evil but there are alot of good theorys which say she is good and mono  became the thin man so he may get freed by theese kids like he freed the thin man in the second game and then fight because he could mistake them for six or maybe six is with them or maybe he just has become evil and this time he actually is the final boss but lets just hope that this time it will be a happy ending
BEEN WAITING YEARS FOR THIS BABY! I'M SO EXCITED!!!!!
Amazing ❤🎉
OH MY GOD
Let's go! Am I wrong in thinking this looks like co op multiplayer?
This just made my day!!
Finally little nightmares had came back
MY LIFE HAS MEANING TO IT AGAIN!
ITS BACK THEY SAID IT WOULD NEVER HAPPEN AND YET ITS BACK🥳
Let's not forget Tarsier is NOT behind this.. I'm trying to be cautiously optimistic about it but something feels off..
I always checked all video games news for 2 years to check whether its new on will come :)))))))
This is promising! I think this might be our answer for the ending of Little Nightmares 2! 🤩
Let's gooo!!!
OH MY GOD
Oh God its  a watcher/grotesquery from drakengard all over again
Oh my.... OH MY NIGHTMARES!
I knew the third part was close! 💕
I LOVE YOU BANDAI
Is it confirmed if this is two player or not? My family and I loved playing the first two. Would be awesome to play it at the same time.
lets hope we dont get backstabbed this time
This looks awesome!  So glad they're doing a third.
y esta rosa?
You think that little nightmares 2 was long enough? Think again because this one is at least .........6 Hours long!
I AM BEYOND EXCITED HOLY SHIT‼️‼️‼️
Игру создали не Tarsier Studios и это страшно
Peak fiction
Looks like the mirror man is going ro be coming back.
they know how to get a fan excited
Thats to far away :(
Где моно? Я понимаю что его история закончена но ведь моно и шестая нам больше нравились и полюбились
@DazBlack
I'm personally really excited for this. I know the two games sort of have an "ending" with the time loop and what not, but I still like seeing this new aesthetic. The first game was in the ocean and now this one in a desert... Partly anyway. From certain shots it reminds me of the Maw or the pale city, depending on how you look at it. We also have the eye freezing people and eye imagery on blocks and crayons... So, who knows. I'll say this though. If I see a glitching TV while playing and The Thin Man start chasing me, I will lose it.
Puro cine. 🚬🗿
IS THIS REAL?! AM I DREAMING!? IF I AM, DON'T WAKE ME UP!!!
OMG OMG OMG YESSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!! Thank you so much for thiiiis!!!
this trailer got me like
I LOVE ITTTTT
i will miss mono and six not gonna lie, but damn this looks awesome!
YESSSSSSSSS LITTLE NIGHTMARES WILL NEVER DIE!!!!
ME VENGOOOOOOOOOOOOO
IM SCREAMING RIGHT NOW TF???????
i know this looks different from the previous little nightmares and i have my doubts whether it will be a good game or not, but i had the same feeling about little nightmares 2 and it turned out to be fire
Жаль, что мы не узнаем, что произошло с Шестой. Жду с нетерпением игры)
Holy shit little nightmares 3 is real
Just about time, we all have been waiting!
Best horror series ever
OMAGA
Please i just want the game now😭😭😭
Both games have been great so far. I think they can nail a third one.
Hyped.
Ngl that cliff hanger from part two made me wait💀
Holy hell im so excited !!!!!!!!
Holy. Shit.
YESSSS🔥🔥
"Little Nightmares 2 is going to be the final game in the series!"   Lol. I wouldn't get too excited about this game. I love the first 2 games, but I have a feeling that they're making this game due to corporate pestering, not because they genuinely want to make a 3rd game. Expect for the quality to be lower than the other two.   Or not, whatever. It's a 50/50, but it was a 100/0 for the first two games, so...
!!!!
Co op?
Боже мой, как же я рад!
Lo aspettavo da tanto, finalmente è uscito il trailer! Spero che sia un capolavoro come il 2!
OH MY MONO I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS!!
I love this!!! But can we please save Momo from his fate!!
Alright, kids, I think we’ll have a lot of fun, work through some issues. Let’s just stay out of trouble, okay? No eating people and no throwing each other down chasms, okay? Okay.
WHAT THE FUCK HOLY SHIT WHAT
yes
YES!! FINALLY WE HAVE WAITED FOR THIS!! Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeessssss!!!
NO WAY IM SO EXCITEDD
Yesssssss!!!!! Yesssssss it's been 2 whole years and it's out
Genial 😮 ahora sí me voy a comprar el 2
Finally my favorite game came back, I'm so excited to play this!
IM SO EXCITED!! Hopefully mono or six make an appearance!!
Oh this shall be FUN
Just gotta wait a year
Finally after two years !
Cant wait
No way! No way! The day I've been waiting for has arrived!
The concepts for thw monsters are gon be crazy
The milking begins. This isn't developed by the original Tarsier studio as they've moved on from Little Nightmares. I loved the first 2 games sad to see it reduced to a cash grab.
Мы дождались этого!!!
little desertmares, hope these 2 don't betray each other
if im being honest it dosent hit the same its just to bright for little nightmares but still exited
I absolutely love the world of little nightmares, and im so glad that bandai is exploring it more There's so much you can do with this concept
Wonder if we'll at least get a cameo of six or mono
OH MY GOSH FINALLYYYY I GOTTA KNOW THEIR NAMEESSSS
YEEEEEEESSS!!!!!! My son is gonna lose his marbles! 🤠
OMG OMG OMG ITS BEEN SO LONG
Bro this came out of nowhere
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Yes! Yes!
دييين
Oh wow LN2 reskin is coming
THIS LOOKS SO AMAZING!!
We've been waiting so long and it looks good
SO EXCITED!! I hope this atleast will have some sort of colleration to the previous stories and that we get to see some of Six or/and Mono, but i'll be playing it regardless!!
I just came to say that I'm screaming and this is the best news I've had in ages
OH MY GOD. THIS IS NO WAYYYYY AAAAAAAAA
oausgydh!!! IM SO READY FOR THIS I LOVE LITTLE NIGHTMARES!!!!💞💞💞💞💞
IM GONNA SCREAM THIS LOOKS SO COOL ALREADY SGHAGSHD <3333  hopefully we dont get another betrayal tho....
Esto es hermosísimo..!!! Tenía la esperanza de que este día llegaría..!!! 😭
MY FAVORITE HORROR GAME SERIES IS GONNA BE A TRILOGY!!!!!!!!!!!
Just watched it live and nearly woke up my neighbors 😅
OH MY GOD ITS GOT INSPIRATION FROM THAT ONE COMIC SERIES! THE DESERT! THE NORTH WIND! THE MIRRORS! YES
I DID NOT EXPECT A 3RD PART WOO!
I spit coffee on myself it's too early for this bandai-
My reaction when i saw this trailer!!!😮
I hope we get to murder six cause honestly I've still not recovered 😂
this is the best day
Looks interesting
Is anyone else getting vibes of the film 9? The design of the characters heavily resemble the rag dolls including 7 with the beak mask.
AMOOOO!❤️
HERR WE GO EVERYONE
Damn, this is the most unexpected thing I've seen today Thank you for not giving up on this
NO WAY NO WAY. THIS IS GONNA BE FIRE
YES YESSSSS YESSSSSSS
THIS MADE MY DAY HOLY SHIT
After finished little nightmares 2 I always thought that the final installment would conclude mono and six’s story and break the cycle
i started screaming when i saw this on my recommended XD
Oh... Different studio... That explains the new aesthetic :/ I hope it's as good as the previous ones
OH MY GOD????? YES YES YES
oh MY GOD
Took you long enough
HOLY SHIT THIS LOOKS INTERSETING
OMGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
Someone get Nick from GamerJoob!!!
Justo acabo de empezar esta saga. Hace poco termine el 2, y ver que ya anunciaron el 3, uffff! Tremenda joyita el Little Nightmares
omg!!
I've been nervous about what Little Nightmares III would look like since it was said, in 2021, that Tarsier Studios (the makers of the first two) were finished with the series. It can be messy when a new installment in a series is handled by a different team. This trailer, though, has done a lot to assure and excite me. The music and the visuals both seem to capture the feel of the previous games perfectly, and I'm glad that they emphasized these new, unfamiliar environments and the involvement of the buddy character. I'm really hopeful for this.
Okay I have a theory yes a game theory you'll be going through some kind of portals to different times I have no real evidence except some places were sandy and others weren't
I'm kinda concerned with Tarsier Studios not developing this game as it's made by a different studio and is most likely not going to have Six or Mono. I understand the creativity aspect of this studio wanting to have their own characters in this world but I am disappointed that it's not continuing the story most likely. Besides that though, the trailer looks good! 😂
So exited! Cant wait to have a heart attack while playing it!
holy shit
YESSIR!!!
IVE NEVER PLAYED THE LN GAMES BUT I LOVE THE LORE AND LOVE WATCHING PEOPLE PLAY LETS GOOOOOO
Ahieisvduebdbejehdh Yeeeessess little nightmares 3 I'm so excited for this hehehehehe
What about complet t story of mono ?
You have to be kidding me right now I thought I was done with this madness guess not.
I'm SO hyped for this!!
I AM SUPER EXCITED  but it doesnt really have the old little nightmares look because of the tarsier studio situation
I can't help it, but I don't feel that excited knowing that Tarsier aren't developing it.
Its time for JT to make the third little nightmare rap...
LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!
HELLL YESSSS
OMGGGGGGGG ITS HAPPANING PPL ITS. HAPPANING. STAY CLAM
I’m so excited I’m LITERALLY CRYING!!!!!!!!😅😮😮😮
okay, everyone. time to say the line: AH SH*T, here we go again.
i wonder who these guys r
I literally just beat part 2 like 2 weeks ago I thought this hell was over !!!!!😭😭
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
OUTTA NJOWHER
The kids look older and one seems to hold a weapon. Do we get to fight some smaller enemies this time?
Interesting that Supermassive is the new developer of this IP. I'm not 100% sold, but what can you do when the original developer was snapped up by another publisher?
YES
I WASNT EXPECTING THIS!!! <33333333333
This is awesome and I like that it’s sets in the daytime roughly. Can’t wait to see unique monsters in this sequel. I hope one day that any animated studio can make a adult animated horror movie with the little nightmares animation style.
WHAT
OH MY GOSH OH MY GOSH IM SO EXCITED TO PLAY THIS💕
I hope there won’t be any betrayal..
Wait it won’t be on STEAM?! Also FINALLY! 😭 LOVE THIS FRANCISE
Hope this one is longer than 2 hours :|
Different studio and probably different writer for the story, i'm skeptical - but let's hope it turns out good.
No mono no six= no playing
УРАУАРКО
Little Nightmares III would most likely be a direct sequel to the first game, since Little Nightmares II is a prequel with Six slowly becoming one of the main antagonists of the whole story.  I'm curious about the new setting of LN III and the story of the two new protagonists.
LETS GO IVE BEEN WAITING SO LONG FOR THIS
OMG OMG😭😭😭😩😩😩
So that means we are never going to have that promissed dlc for LN2?
THE DAY WILL SOON COME.
LET'S GO BABY!
THIS LOOKS SICK OMG
IM SO EXCITED OMG OMG
Looks good, but idk, it's not feels like Little Nightmares.  Anyways, i really want to play it
YES!
i cant wait!
LITTLE NIGHTMARES IS FINALLY BACKKKKKKKKK OH MY GOD. LOVE  THE NEW LOCATIONS AND THE NEW GUYS!!!
Tarsier studios thanks for all again because theyre making this series i remember this game first name was hunger and now we have waiting for ln3 supermassive studios goodluck
The new mad max, aspect its really cool
IM SO HYPED
LET’S GO I’VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
YEEEEEASSSSSSS YEEEAAAAAAAH
"THE TIME HAS COME AND SO HAVE I"   My favorite horror franchise has a new game coming soon!
This is so COOL I'm beyond excited XD
I have questions, like where is Mono and Sasha? (hopefully they explain that in this game) And are these characters the new main protagonist or will they meet up with Mobo and Sasha?!
It's reallllll
OH MY GOD IM IN CLASS RIGHT NOW AND I SAW THIS NOTIFICATION I SWEAR I SCREAMED (I got a lot of stares but it was worth it!!!)
I love they are taking pages out of the comics. A lot of those scenes and details hint at parts of the Little nightmare comics, which sadly were considered not canon until maybe now? Beware if you want to read up on it tho, the comics might spoiler the game.
Didn't the original team disband after little nightmares 2?
cant wait actually
I don't mean to be so negative, but compare this to LN2's trailer. LN2's trailer is full of atmosphere, world-building and mystery. This trailer just seems to scream "Look at all the wacky things you can do with your friend!" I have a lot of doubts. Doubts that Supermassive really understand why Tarsier Studios made LN in the first place, and what they wanted to do with it. The world of LN was never really about wacky environments and outfits. The characters in LN3 look like they would fit better in a Borderlands game. My main takeaway is that the levels in this trailer seem more like stages of a play, instead of a real world like in previous games....
HO MON DIEU HO MON DIEU HO MON DIEU OUIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII 🎉🎉🎉🎉
YES YES YES YES YES
OH MY GOD OH MY GOD OH MY GOD OH MY WMKWISJWIWOWIJEJDBDBD
I'm little afraid, because I've not idea if the third game are going to supress the previous ones, but I'm hoping for it. if the soundtrack be as good as it was in Little nightmares 2, i'm really fine with It!
Hyped my favorite was the first 1 the second one was also good can’t wait
Little nightmares is my favourite game I’m excited and so happy
Been Yessss!!!!!!!! I didn't know they were going to do a third. I'm so excited!
I hope it still able to go on ps4 on release

MY GOTY 2024 ALREADY REVEALED!
YEEESSSSSS
I've been waiting for this for so many years, but now that I know for sure that part 3 will still come out... I have no words, perhaps I missed him so much all this time ... And waiting a year is not a problem at all.
Vine aqui por Auron xd
OMG YESSSSS
I'M SO HAPPY, SO EXCITED!!! SUCH A LONG TIME OF WAITING AND IT'S FINALLY HAPPENING!!! I'M SO HAPPY LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOO
For some reason, this feels like a different game.
Where is SHE?! Where is the traitor?!
Where did you come from?
This looks so much more different than the first two. I think a different company worked on this with BANDAI rather than Tarsier Studios. Because of that, I'm not looking forward to it.
at last.  another trip down Misery Lane. let's gooo!
THE HYPE IS REAL OMG
2024 😢😢 can't wait but okay it is crazyyyy ! The first and the second are in my favorite games !
omg for real, finally!!!
WHAAAAAAAAT??????????   Wait nah nah you can’t do that while there are other things that I’m excited about.   LETS GOOO 🗣️🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥  I’ve seen YouTubers play the 1 and 2 game from start to finish since it wasn’t out on switch. I’ll play my first horror game on switch.
If they don’t make this one two player, I’ll be very upset
Came out of nowhere lol
Wow i loved this traielr❤
YES OMG!!!!! IM SO HYPED!!!!♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
MY BOY MONO BETTER GET A COMEBACK!!!! SIX DID HIM DIRTY IN THE LAST GAME

Finally is back!!!!! Let's go finally yes
Bruh Now Little Nightmares is another Fnaf
Gosh, this is so cool! Can't wait to see what this one brings. Glad it's finally back.

I’m so excited! This is my favorite horror series ever!
YEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSS😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
YES FINALLY THANK YOU!!!!
Beautiful as always
OH YES, I can't wait for this! ❤❤
So it's not the same studio as the two previous ones, right? It was Tarsier, not Supermassive.
YES. I love Little Nightmares so much
This is going to be fun
Wow this gonna be awesome! I always love Little Nightmares! It's my favourite horror game series of all time!
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
WHAAAAAAAAAAA
Never thought I’d see it happen
I’m buyin soon as I can
LETS GOOOOOOO
Little nightmares 2 was nothing short of a masterpiece. The only minor thing it lacked was an offline co-op feature. We are finally getting it now for part 3!!  Edit: The lady said, online co-op. Now I am worried. How can it not have an offline co-op when it already has online? Doesn't make sense.
Two things I’m hoping  1. This continues an overarching story, rather than just another game of its own questions with little to do with the other settings.  2. WE BETTER GET TO SEE THE NORTH WIND HE WAS SO COOL IN THE COMICS
I can’t wait I’m too excited
Finally 😊
Really glad this is getting made. The previous two were so good :) Looking forward to this
WE FUCKIN WON LETSGOOOOOOOOOOOO
I will wait for ln III and ln mobile
