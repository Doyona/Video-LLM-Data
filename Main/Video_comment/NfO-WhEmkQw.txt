🖤💛🖤💛🖤💛🖤💛🖤💛🖤💛🖤💛🖤💛🖤💛🖤💛⚽️👍🏿👍💪🏿💪🏻✌🏽
Amazing im fans b.dortmund from indonesia 🇲🇨
Borussia a gOlear
Borussia dormunt a ganar
FutbOL rapido con buen pase
Sancho is a star
3:03 sportsmanship
that's some nice control by reus
Respect to Reus, he's an absolute legend!
Dortmund are STACKED 🔥
I will give everything to play football and that smile on reus face what a lad
1:46 beast
this was a white wash
Where is reus
2:14 epic moment 😘
Is hazard still a Chelsea player or we sold him too?
hey
🖤💛
Duisburg would make Oldham athletic look like Barca
Ройс лучший👍
Reus👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Observed one thing, Haaland falls, Every other Dortmund player scores on that chance, Poor Haaland should've got 'least one.
If united are clever they'll take all Dortmund's scouting staff
Bellingham is a great player.
Equipazo k tiene el dormund y si reus se recupera para pelear por cosas importantes
Am I the only one who thinks German football camera's are the best cos the angle is Brilliant and easy to watch
so what. you are still no match for bayern munich. haha,,,
REUS❤️❤️❤️❤️
Marco Reus could have been the top top player not for injuries. I feel bad for him, if not for injuries, he would be up there. He has everything for a world class player...everything.
Hello
Play on   57:03 Score on 57:43       Welcome back captain🙏
Thats reus🔥🔥🔥
I always wanted reus to go to real madrid but he's injury prone shame
It's great to see Dortmund winning, but even greater is Reus' return from injury. He looks really sharp and his finishing has always been sublime.
Dortmund for likes and Bayern for comments
Referee in this game was good. Good decisions without VAR
HEY jude welcome back marco
not Dortmund supporter...but REUS is such a legend....what a player and what a captain <3  one of the most loyal and committed players
Just watching to see if sancho does well😂😂
To the person that’s reading this:  You’re very intelligent and adorable human! Stay healthy in quarantine  My dream is to have 2k subscribers.I been struggling to get there!🙏🙏a
Dortmund have quite the team here 💥
This should’ve taken place in Gotham City I honestly think that would be so cool
Reus💛
Disembody Narrative of Self🎈Non-Duality
I beg the injuries curse to leave Reus alone 😭❤
German beers are the best!
2020 is an incredibly weird year. The first year that Thorgan Hazard is miles ahead of his brother Eden in stats, form, and fitness.
good to have some english talent on show hope it lasts
Marco reus 😍😍😍😍
If you are reading this comment:  💕BE BLESSED!!!   x1,000,000💕⚽️🌈✨💫
ONLY People who didn’t come from *tiKtoK* are worthy of liking this
We all know which hazard is the best hazard this days
Hazard pass to Bellingham is madness
Reus is looking pretty quick 👀
?
?
Good dortmund squad against bayern domination this season in bundesliga
driveshafts hyssop
Jadon sancho fantastic penalty
Gooooolasaos
sellout club
They maybe only played against a 3.Liga sides. But did anyone notice how flexible were they playing yesterday? I notice only Hitz (GK), Haaland (ST) and Hummels (CB) thag didn't switch position between each other last night.
1:08 Haaland with a Pelé no-touch-skill move. Yes, a body feint and not a single touch on the ball! Look up Pelé's original execution!
Sou brazuca
Reus is fire
Have the rules changed regarding goals then? Because I would have thought Reyna's goal would actually be accredited to Witsel.
1:21 his name is Thor and he makes a Tor!
Marco rues is always in form If he don't have injury problem probably he is better than Ronaldo
woa 😯
Sancho is going to United.
reus is so good but very unfortunate
Fantastic squad come on Borussia Dortmund 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻🖤💛 echte liebe ❤️❤️❤️
So real Madrid bought the wrong hazard?
Très beau match 😍 Un retour de fou Reus 💪🏻
This season we can go forward
How do I get a trial from South Africa 😭would literally do anything to make it professional. Any opportunity would work. My country doesn't offer much😓💔
jude bellingham will be dortmunds next cash in.
That 1st touch from Reus for his goal, after so long out, wow. Top class
Reus is the best
This Dortmund side really full of baller
Marco♡♡♡
What division team is that...they looked like sunday league team
Hazard underrated
why didnt haland have a goal?
It's good to see that one hazard is scoring goals
Ich bin ne Gladbach fan aber ich hab so viel Angst jetzt, nicht vor Dortmund aber vor Reus. Er ist wirklich gefährlich und noch immer gut
Gooo Marcooo✌✌
League seems to be worse than pl 3rd division
But in reyna free kick it was defkection of witsel so is taht witsel or rayna goal
Borisff
2 goals scored by 17 year olds. Crazy.
Reus uyir😘😘😘😘😘😘
САнчо в МЮ!!!
Dortmund just want to get a money,not a title 😂
JAAA!!! MARCO REUUUS!!!💛🖤💛🖤
I didn’t imagine I’d ever say this but Thorgan Hazard is faar better than Eden Hazard.
Why isn't Dortmund wearing their new Pikachu home kit?
T Hazard motm
Dortmund need to have a good mixture of talent+experience. That's the only way they can have a chance for a title this season
Hazard is one of the best player in the world .I am following him since Chelsea days now he is in Dortmund happy to watch him playing😂
2 free kicks!
Reus needed like 1 minute to score
Great to see Reus back on the pitch.
reus is back the fifa 17 boy finally your back
Hazard underated
how is everyone  letting their superstar young talent go to dortmund so they can markup the price tag 100000x to get them back?
They fighting some lower tier team xD BVB would be eating Bayern’s dust if they face them.

Well all Man Utd fans are like Sancho's on🔥 Billingham's a 🔥prospect & Haaland's touch isn't that 🔥. We got Martial, Rashford & Greenwood. Take your pick.
waw hazard
Marco Reus returns yeah
Bellingham debut goal KRO
Dortmund🟡⚫️
Sancho must be the MU player
This Hazard better then that Hazard 😆
Hazar👍
Witsel touched the ball last but goal was given to Reyn 😂😂
Where did these guys learn how to defend? 😂
New Jersey
T.Hazard > E.Hazard
Marco Reuusssss
I miss so much hakimi 😭😭💛🖤
Mad seeing a young lad from birmingham playing with reus
Sancho haland y reus
Where is reiner jesus?
O que foi aquela cobrança de falta do hazard
Shout out to Dortmund scouting they been putting the work in for years so called bigger teams can learn a thing or 2
First dembele, pulisic, now sancho & bellingham. What a scout from Dortmund
MARCO REUS 💛🖤
Imagine if reus 100% fit in all season
Did Reinier play at all?
Only clicked to see my boy haaland’s goals
2:11 KING IS BACK
*REUS AT DORTMUND IS KIND OF TOTTI AT ROMA* 🙌🏻🔥🔥🔥 *LET'S GET THAT BUNDESLIGA DORTMUND* 🟡⚫🟡
Reus 💛💛💛👏👏
Little suggestion: don't include the score or the result in the title it's nice to have a surprise!
Bravo Bravo  maybe LEwandowski GOOL :D
The keeper is shocking tbh
I miss the Marco Reus to Liverpool rumours.
Welcome back, capitan
Thorgan hazard wow 😳 has improved
The German leagues a joke, state of the rest of the teams
imagine instead of selling their best players dortmund actually sign 2 or 3 very good experienced players. they would dominate for years to come.
Real Madrid signed the wrong hazard
Haaland behind every goal. Man that guy is a powerhous
Sancho my man
MARCOOOO WIR LIEBEN DICH MARCO WE LOVE YOU
Halland makes 2 fault assist
When you realize this might be Sancho's last goal for Dortmud
Halland makes 2 fault assist
Good blay dortmond 💛🖤 🏆
Sancho most likely staying
Wasn’t the best performance from Dortmund, but inspirational from reus 💛🖤💛🖤💛
Reus always marks his return every season
Was real surprised by the initial  score line there..
Reus <3
Giovanni Reyna 🇺🇸🇺🇸
Wrong score line
Marco♥️♥️♥️
