i thought he was talking about a vital point for chelsea
Chelsea scored 2 goals amazing performance…
Chelsea fans celebrating a draw against a relegation team at their own ground, such a Chelsea thing 💀
Scrappy goals by forest, but they all count. Beautiful first touch of 3 for the first goal though.
0:34 good goal by forest
lol Chelsea fans mocking Forest, sit down you absolute embarrassment of a "top" club.
Chelsea are so crap 🤣🤣🤣
After 34 gameweek sterling played his favoured position. I dont even remember how many left wingers does chelsea have 😂😂😂😂
Sky got jokes huh😂
Glad they survived Nottingham forest ! Lucky Chelsea😅
A great relegation battle game, fair play to Chelsea for stealing a point
Good display but 2 deserved points dropped by forest  against a small team
Why would anyone support chelsea when Brentford are so close?
Damn the underdogs got a point and were 2-1 up at a point
Chelsea fans singing who are ya   Is hilarious 🤣🤣, they was actuslly getting jolly because they scored 2 goals against the team everyone scores against Bless them
Big Big draw for Chelsea tonight against a bigger club
Vital result for forest
Have your last laughs because when we get going in about 18 years your all in trouble!
All those players Chelsea have all the money at the club and yet Forest was by far a better team 👍
Bring back Kepa
My first jersey was a Forest one, back in the 70s when they were running the show in Europe. So happy for them, a point here was crucial to them staying up.
How are Chelsea struggling to get a win when they have so much quality in offensive positions?
Sterling must miss being at City...
Chelsea are back.
Mendy could’ve done better
Chelsea fans singing 'who are ya' to then drop a point. Could be no other tea
Guaranteed if Kepa was there they'd a lost again, thankfully Mendy was playing so a point was at least secured if not a win.
I feel like crying for Chelsea when you brought championship players to play in the premier league... This is the type of results you get 😢
this is going to be Chelsea going forward, its clear no matter what manager comes in, they are still going to be a mid table team. Big Ted is to blame.
Chelsea are worst now than Manchester United under Solskjear and that's very bad
lewis hall is such a good player given his age
Crucial point for both teams!💪
Chelsea is on an unbeaten run of two games.
How did Mendy go from being so good to so poor so quickly?
2:29 " going down going down going down" Goal for Forrest!!! 😂😂😂
Awoniyi former liverpool player...
It’s crazy to think that Chelsea would be in a relegation battle had it not been for that first month when Tuchel was in charge
Chelsea fans giving it big now that they’ve reached the 40 point mark 😂
Comments are too harsh on Chelsea fans, they were singing about their own club going down, so humble and down-to-earth
What a world class manager Lampard is. Chelsea should keep him next season.
Mangala (I think it was no 5) makes the first goal with super tackle then allows the second by not tracking his man.
Steve cooper manages like tommy cooper , useless
Chelsea might aswell become a charity the way they be donating points to these teams
The assist for the 2nd Forest goal was cool😘
Hey Sterling In those positions and that’s what he does
Amazing that Forrest have two better keepers than Chelsea.
Listen, don't knock Chelsea, 4 points out of the last 6, they're on a roll🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
too many championship quality players at Chelsea
I know the admin meant ‘relegation battle’ from Forests perspective but they really did us dirty there🤣 fair play.
Chelsea fans singing "who are yah" not Nottingham Forest, that is embarrassing such a bad football club
The most consistent club this year imo. Loss and draw ratio has been fantastic. Consistency is key.
Chelsea stinkkkkkk😂😂😂😂
Chelsea are utter dross
Lampard is a shocking manager he has no skillset he needs to rebuild in europe and then come again too get sacked from everton and then come to chelsea and not improve one bit says it all
That's the sterling we saw at the beginning of the season well done
That Chelsea fan singing, "Going down, going down, going down" a split second before the equaliser 🤣🤣🤣
Lampards a genius grabbing points like this against a team like Forrest
Lol Felix should of come to villa😂😂
Chelsea got to regret the sterling signing
Chelsea fans must be delighted that ticket prices have been frozen again…..affordable entertainment 😂😂😂
The sooner Chelsea realise Thiago Silva isn't good enough for this league the better ..As for Lampbard no wonder there's managers in the lower league fuming over people like him ... dreadful manager
All the comments against Chelsea, its true what people say, dogs only bark. We'll see you next season to show you what we really are. One bad season and all the dogs come out barking 😂😂😂
Chalobah is as classy as Harry Maguire.
kepa>mendy
Chelsea were 10 points clear of the relegation zone before hand, no chance of getting relegated?!
As a Liverpool fan Thank you Chelsea for bringing me joy during this disastrous season, hope you manage it out of relegation
What's gone wrong all of a sudden
Congrats to Chelsea for securing an important point
Looks like Mendy's return to the net went well. Surely at fault for both goals. Looked like that header was straight at him.
Drawing against a team that poor, you could argue is a really good result for Chelsea
Sterling as sharp as his Gillette ads in front of goal
Glad to see this club that was irrelevant until Russian money came in back to mediocrity
Mendy man, poor choice made by starting him he was not ready to return
Let’s all laugh at Forest for getting a draw with Chelsea. 🤣🤣🤣
This is the worst Chelsea team I have ever seen, absolutely troubles they fighting for relegation
A billion spent to stave relegation, stonks
Chelsea looking safe from relegation. Incredible job by Lampard keeping them up.
2 stupid goals chelsea concede 🤦🏻‍♂️
chelsea spent 300 million and they have some random kid in the team wow
£600m for 11th place. Mugs.
2 games without a loss. Lampard is slowly improving
A huge relegation battle and maybe frank lamprad has got the point to get them 17th, the point to save them from the drop in the upcoming weeks
@2:30 you can hear the "going down" chant from a Chelsea fan, oblivious that their own club is in the toilet. Delusion.
It’s crazy how Forest have won two European trophies, the same a Chelsea. Yet both their fortunes have been vastly different. I don’t want them to go down, Chelsea have some good young players.       I can’t believe I’m making jokes about my team 😭
RAHEEM STERLING CHELSEAS BEST PLAYER
What a great result a totally unexpected point ....for chelsea
Chelsea have got to be the most boring side I have seen for years. Awful. Hopefully go down next season
Coops❤
Frank Lumphead has absolutely No Idea how to manage a premier team. Wouldn't have him doing the kids on a Sunday morning. Totally Inept.
Only cost £488,000,000 for that vital HOME point. What a sham of a club. Rich club not big club.
These kind of games show why are not fighting for relegation. What a team
If this was Man Utd the media would be milking it.
Lampard the coaching genius
Chelsea are fighting a relegation battle now for next season.... LMAO
Chelsea are so embarrassing to watch now.... LMAO 😂🤣😅😆😁
I hope Chelsea keep Lumpard next season....  🤣🤣
Forest should have won today Lodi missed a brilliant chance of winning the game for Forest but hopefully we can beat arsenal
Massive point for Forrest
Poch appointment makes sense now🤔 that conference league run finna be legendary 🔥🔥🔥
WHO ARE YA
I thought it was a joke saying Chelsea would not win lol
sounds deathly in there
Renan Lodi is so underrated, his awareness and positioning is class, from a Chelsea fan
Important point for Chelsea
sterling has finally arrived at the big club he was longing for  ... unfortunately he just couldn't fit a dive somewhere in the box too
sad
Now Lampard is trying to get Everton relegated by giving Nott'm points:)))
Some long ass Ad
Am happy with a point let's go Chelsea 😁
Awoniyi > sterling
2:35: just can’t stop watching the Chelsea fans behind the goal in pure agony🤣🤣🤣
Awoniyi is starting to show the stuff he's made of. Great performance.
Lampard is the gift that keeps giving 😂
Worth a tenner on backing Chelsea for relegation next season 😄
Hope Chelsea get relegated next season they are so crap
Mendy & Kepa need to go
i swear sterling changes hairtstyle every game
Finally started mendy tbh mendy should leave the club he should go to Tottenham they need a gk
Got to love Chelsea fans saying who are ya to Nottingham Forest. They’re a bigger club with incredible supporters.  Something Chelsea can only dream of
2:23 Who are ya chants against a relegation scrap team, shameful 😂😂😂
w
Chelsea shudve won
Was there, Gallagher is useless
Nice game between two relegation rivals
I knew that even when Chelsea went 2-1 up, they were never going to win it 😂 that's how far they've sunk. Dear me.
Chelsea fan: ''Who are yah?''  A few moments later ... Forest equalise.
Chelsea should be pleased with that draw against a bigger side
got to praise lampard for keeping this championship level team in the prem top manager
Forest should’ve won
Mendy has to go. He had one good season
All jokes aside woulda loved chelsea to get relageted
With kepa playing we prob dont concede them goals, odd decision to start mendy! Oh well, “we are stayin up!”
Chelsea in competition with Spurs to become the biggest banter club this season 😂😂😂😂
Lampard kept Everton up last year, looks like he may do the same for Chelsea this season !
2:30 “going down going down going down 👴🏻” immediately equalised 😂😂
This was a very crazy game 🫨
Below was my comment after the Nottingham Forest 4 vs 3 Southampton game. I will not add or remove until the season is over. This is all Cooper needs to encourage his team to aim at.    @onuchinathaniel4367 @onuchinathaniel4367 1 day ago I think Forest will stay up. They are deserving of staying in the premier league. Cooper has done well with the limitations in quality at his disposal. Awoniyi bn off injured for a long period this season. Good he is back in form. So long as he stays in form upfront and the ball can get to him around the box, he has couple of goals to score. It will be more about how tidy they organise not to concede goals. Chelsea at the moment is ordinary. I believe they can get something off Chelsea and Crystal palace. If they get the right balls in to Awoniyi as much as possible as a point man, they can still win one more game.
Why start Mendy then frank?
super frank!  the saviour of chelsea.
everton...  look what you could have had! 7 games... 4 points...  missed a trick there!
everton...  look what you could have had! 7 games... 4 points...  missed a trick there!
2:22 Chanting "who are ya" at Nottingham Forest then getting a draw 🤣🤣🤣
raheem with a brace to justify his £325k a week salary...  & super frank master minding a miracle turn around to keep chelsea in the prem'.
super frank at the wheel to navigate chelsea to mathematical safety...  massive point at home... well done frank.
Well done today Nottingham forest onto the next one come on you reds
The low point of the season for sure, conceding 2 goals to Chelsea.
Two points dropped for Forest
How BAD are Chelsea??  They can’t even win at home v Forest🤣🤣🤣🤣
Sterling is on fire, it’s his first brace in 889 games. 250k a week, worth every penny 😂😂
Love how you can hear a Chelsea fan singing “Going down, going down, going down” a few seconds before Forest score their second 😂
I almost feel bad for the Chelsea fans... But then I remember Todd Boehly thought he knew better than every football person who worked for the club and he deserves what he gets
Big point for Chelsea that in their battle for survival
😂
Come in FOREST
Good point for Chelsea today. Next season could be tough with only 300m to spend, there’s absolutely no reason why this club couldn’t be aiming for a spot inside the top ten.   Hopefully Lampard could bring in his cousin Jamie and uncle Harry. I could see that being a right naughty little cockney concoction. Lampard for his tactical astuteness, Harry for budget control, and Jamie for the bantz.
Who are ya..... well their a relegation side you cant beat.
I bet Mendy absolutey stinks in the dressing room
Drop KEPA then have a GK error
Chelsea IS in trouble. I`m in pain.
A vital point for both teams
Arsenal (h) Crystal Palace (a) and 1 point will seal Forest survival. 'We believe' U REDS!!!!
Fun Fact Sterling has more goals then Jack Grealish 😂😂😂
Chelsea doing really well to stay out of relegation even after how little money they have spent
Leicester 1 3 Chelsea  Chelsea 2 2 Everton  Bournemouth 1 3 Chelsea Chelsea 2 2 Nots Forest  What is it with us drawing 2-2 with relegation threatened clubs after a 3-1  away win
Relegation battles getting tense.
Chelsea fans were brave to sing "Who are you?" at 2-1.  Sorry, did I say brave? I mean dumb.😂
Seems Chelsea have more pints than points
Why change keepers at this stage. It’s not like kepa has been poor and making mistakes. He’s been generally good recently. No match sharpness from mendy. Cost us the win.
big relegation scrap this!
Mangala  🔥🔥🔥❤️
0:57 that cross from hall is a 10/10
Who are ya who are ya lasted 4 minutes
1:53 - the Epitome of Joao Felix. All Style, no substance. Chelsea should not waste their money on signing him permanently and actually try and poach Awoniyi from today's visitors this Summer. He's just what they need.
Mendy though he would be better than Kepa 😂😂😂
Imagine limbs like that, going 2-1 up against Forest. Genuinely an embarrassment from top to bottom that club is 😂
The bots in this comment section is insane
You reds come on  ,lets have some, Big point for forest
Only if Southampton had spent 600 mill as well..
The upset of the day. Forest will be kicking themselves
Lampard and Gerrard, both great players, have missed a trick. If they’d have paid their dues, they could have been representing the UK in tonight’s Eurovision as a duet.
AWONIYI.  Ah woe knee yee. Shm. Some of these u.k commentators are so thick.
When I heard Southampton had been relegated I thought lampard had taken charge of the second half 😂
If we’re lucky enough to survive the drop I cannot wait to see how awonii does next season, he’s suddenly turned into a goal monster 😂
Those long throws are devastating
It breaks my heart seeing mendy making mistakes like this 😢 what happend 💔
£600 million spent 😂😂😂😂
Why the he'll did lampard start mendy
Who needs Osimhen when you have Awoniyi 👍🏽
Shouldnt be dropping points against relegation teams, Poor from Forest
Chelsea would struggle in non-league divisons, and that's just a fact
More like 'Sterling double seals vital points for Chelsea'
I trust all the Chelsea players will get a bonus for this incredible 2 goal performance (and even a point) which far exceeded expectations against relegation candidate opposition
Mah bruv I was so close I predicted 3'2 to Chelsea!
Why is Mandy playing ? Yes Mandy used to be good keeper 🤔
2 pointe dropped for Forest. Gutted.
This Forest result on the back of the two recent victories will be the impetus for their survival. Chelsea will come back as a huge driving force next year!! Make no mistake.
Ah, yes, team who spends 600 million in 2 transfer windows is such a absolute title challenge team Genuinely not surprised got what they deserved, gonna get relegated next year
Smellsea aren't doing very good after their victory.
Come on you reds
If it wasn't for the first like 8 games for Chelsea, they might actually have been in a relegation battle, absolutely shocking
I saw 67 down the left for Chelsea,  thought... wow... mydrik has improved a lot since last time I seen him..... then I realised it wasn't him and genuinely laughed out loud. 😂 coyg..
Not sure how Niakhate missed that chance and we continue to concede soft goals but a good away point to keep us in with a chance of staying up.
another lampard masterclass
it was definitely a mistake putting mendy in goal didnt even get one save and let in two easy goals
If Sterling plays properly his a great player
Forest should have got 3 points against that championship standard team 🧐
Chelsea are turd. Players should be embarrassed to celebrate like that then can't even hold on for 5 mins
Am I the only one thinking Potter is better? sure we couldn't finish(we still cant) but that was basically our only problem, now there's so many other problems with defence and midfield along with finishing problems.
Terrible support from Chelsea fans. More noise in a library
Got a feeling we may get a point against the gooners
Sterling: I've scored the winning goals Awoniyi: Hold my beer.
Just an average game between a relegation team and Nottingham forest
"Awini" is crazy
Who the hell put Mendy in goal
1:10 I can’t believe teams in the premier league are still doing zone marking, it doesn’t work 😂
0:11 most pointless highlight I have ever seen sky sports put into a match. 😂😂😂😂
Hopefully just 1 more win Forest. You can do this
Gotta feel for Forest fans, that's two points dropped against a bottom half opposition
Embarrassing for everyone involved
Lampard still hasn't beaten Forest as a manager. He's a great asset to the club.
that point is so crucial for their relegation battle  probably good for Forest too
Lampard deserves a full time contract 100%. Absolutely top draw coach and Chelsea are very lucky to have him.
Strong point for Chelsea lampard turning things around
Cheshit cant even beat Rottingham.
Chelsea fans singing who are ya to forest hahaha after the season they are having i would keep quiet
They need to beat relegation threatened clubs to be taken seriously. Poor showing...   From Forest.
Chelsea fans were only shouting who are you because they couldn't pronounce the Nottingham Forest scorers name, so he scored again to help them pronounce it 🤣. The words Chelsea, The Championship and Awoniyi will be linked with each other for ever 😂. Your Favorite Gooner 🐼
Mendy had a howler today, dreadful performance.
Sterling is so bad but when he plays good he’s really good, I remember him at city he would be a ghost and then a few games later score 2 and get an assist 😅
You reds! Solid point.
As a Chelsea fan I can safely say Forest deserved to win that.. We are diabolical! Embarrassing
Must be embarrassing for such a big club to only scrape a draw against Chelsea 😂
Bring back super Thomas Tuchel and let him sell the lazy players
Mendy terrible in goal for us again.
Lampard still with the vendetta against Leeds, putting Mendy back in net so their relegation rivals can get something from the game
We forest stay up this season and address our defensive problems properly 💪
Nottingham forest with those long throws always seem to score 😅
Is Mendy the worst keeper to win a Champions League? Any other contenders?
the title is spot on, crucial point for chelsea, commonn🔵🔵🔵
Unbeaten in two, come on Chelsea! Super Frank
Once again a spirited performance from the underdogs , but it wasn’t enough to beat Forest
Chelsea might not thank me but get the contract out, put it on the table. Let him sign it, let him write whatever numbers he wants to put on there, given what he's done since he's come in. Lampards at the wheel, man. He's doing it
If Lampard stays on he'll build the whole Chelsea team around his old England buddy, Sterling.
times are hard for Chelsea when they singing who are ya to forest
Imagine spending all those hundreds of millions and finishing in the bottom half of the table 😂
2:30 “going down, going down” GOAL…ooops! 😂
Guys Forrest had an easy match, Chelsea are already on the beach after avoiding relegation
Well done to Chelsea getting the point that might save them from relegation
General Taiwo is a beast! 💪🏻🇳🇬 Bring on the Gunners next week!
cmon sterling we need the 2019 you rn keep up the form
Two former Liverpool players on the scoresheet for opposite teams 😬
Fulham Arsenal and spurs are all bigger than Chelski.
The who are ya chants after the second goal just to get equalised 4 minutes later are absolutely class and sum up Chelsea's season perfectly
Defend like a pub team ,this current team is a disgrace .
What A match
HAAAAAAAAAS ANYONE SEEN JASON CUNDY?!
Chelski are the smallest team in London.
Awoniyi is the best striker in the world at the moment, i can see Real Madrid, Bayern or Barca signing him in the summer for at least £100m
me in 2021 would never think 2 years later a chelsea match titled "relegation battle" also finally sterling is showing his class
The Sky admin really did Chelsea dirty by calling this a relegation battle 😂
A huge point for Chelsea
Amazing from lampard. Clawing this team out of the relegation battle was a really hard task
A Raheem Sterling brace? Is this 2019?
The man singing "Going down" right before Awoniyi scores is priceless
Rumour has it todd is now about to put it a 100 million pound bid for awonyi
That is a mega point for forest could just keep them up
Sterling on a good day is completely unplayable. He has a few of them every season!
I guess kepa wasn’t the problem
This team I've got more fight then the teams at the bottom 3
Always great do see the underdog to get a point at home and play well
Suprised chelsea have managed safety,they survive another season  What a miracle!!🤯💫
Terrible goalkeeping by Mendy for the first goal. Everytime I see him he makes a mistake
good job chelsea vital point to avoid the championship where you lot belong
Finally u released this game highlights
Come on
It’s Chelsea the average club 😂😂
Bohely sign lamps on a lifetime contract please
What a huge point that could be
Bout time this got uploaded
Chelsea Cannot Even Escape A Forest!
BRING BACK TUCHEL
It’s the history of Chelsea 😂
What a brillaint match this was I dont understand last season they were top 4 now there chances of getting top 10are 1%
Its the history of the chelsea
Awoniyi in brilliant form, 4 goals in 2 games!
Chelsea are actually so embarrassing. Its not even surprising that chelsea drew
WE’RE STAYING UP 💙💙
I think Chelsea will do better than everyone else will be expecting next season. I think they’ll finish with more than 5 points
Best game in a Chelsea shirt from sterling tdy
chelsea
Chelsea are finished 😂
Forest are fighting fir every single point. We deserve to stay up. We are finally clicking! COYR
Young Kippa foaming at the mouth rn 😂😂
😂😂
Relegation battle uno Sky are violating lool  Chelsea are now 2 games unbeaten give Lamps the job full time 🙃😂🤣😹
MASSIVE POINT. Got to name my first two children Keylor and Taiwo
Fingers crossed Forrest can stay in this form and stay up
No way Chelsea score goals now🙀
First
Love it
