wonder how much garbage they left there lol
Look at that fake footage,  is there people this stupid for real.
Nobody has been on the moon
It was faked
63 years later
It is not available on YouTube,his speech that India is America and America is India
Peace because of SPACE....Clearly Neil and India have never watched THE EXPANSE lol.
To all my dear brothers from different nations congratulating India, it is not just India's win, it is the win of the entire mankind, the entire human race!  Jai hind, jai earth. Vasudaiva kutumbakam❤
Love to usa friends 🧡 from india.
🇮🇳✌️
India is also fist country to use 0 to 9,also trigonometry,also algebra,also decimal system,also calculus foundation,phytagoras theorem before phytagoras , geometry,pi value even more your everything even advanced modern physics concept is from us the west only redefine it..
why he is speaking like bilawal bhutto. ohhh maybe bilwal is copying him.
Shoutout to people who believe this  You successfully made me feel superior to you clowns 🤡
DO YOU BELIEVE THIS MISSION COST JUST  75$ MILLION DOLLAR.    LESS THAN HOLLYWOOD MOVIES.   IT JUST AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!! ❤
Knee in the grass python.   I know, but i had to say it!  Its ok, I’ll see myself out 😅
I hate the fact people are talking to modi instead of the isro chief who has knowledge about the matter
This is one of the breakthroughs in recent history that makes Indians proud once again 🔥
Indian Space Agency, ISRO is truly Great and wonderful it has done wonders. Proud to be an Indian.
Americans dont be jealous try to respect each other sucess and dont think you are the only country who can do everything
All i see is a half drugged man and a really bad cgi ,explaining to me i shall believe india reached moon 😂😂😂😂
Repeat after me lel
Elephant in the room : the Cartoon landing show
🇮🇳❤🙏
Respect to India for achieving this feat. Respect to Neil deGrasse Tyson for telling India to get everyone in the country involved as it is pretty divided. Very few with this level of altruism to help an outside country.
Thanks neil(anil)
1969 was a historical year for America because they successfully shot the fake moon landing on screen  and fooled everyone 😊
And some youtubers and tiktokers were making fun of India calling this a facade🤣
Actually if you have  on H and one O  then the substance is not water but a dilluted solid jetstream that can cleane the atmosphere of nuclear wastes particles.  Japan can use this method to clean the Hiroshima bomb residues left in its space.
Sorry. Humans did not go to the moon.  Nor, did we figure out quantum computers.  OR  Did we figure out what happened in Dr. Judy Wood’s book?  Artificial intelligence is fake. Fiction.  Hollywood ate my wife!
His NOSE Doesn't Work. He Cant Smell, who He's Talking to, are different From Him. I Can See they Are.
What a joke 😂😂😂
2:31 with due respect neil please keep your advice to yourself on indian ethnicity and integration, you don't know anything about indian ethnicity. We are one nation sir, don't need your advice to our prime minister regarding how to run a country. Our civilization is one of the oldest and only one still alive so don't tv scientist guy's advice on how keep the indians integrated on development of india, thank you! 🙏
Well we just did a cheaper version of what other countries have already done. A big achievement for sure but not really the most impressive one. I wanna live ro see the day when we actually lead the world in innovation rather than attempt to copy what others have done just at a cheaper price.
Amazing ❤
Neil is hated so much and justifiably
Meanwhile other Western media houses, arguing that why India send that mission. Shame on them
Other leaders meeting with celebrities = Cool   India Leader meeting and reconizing the Real Celebrity  = DONE RIGHT 🙏🤝
He laughed way too hard at his own joke
Did they found sentinel prime there
Man what double standards from Neil, I heard him once saying he doesn't do politics or debate people on but he is in full flow about diversity and inclusivity and preaching India about diversity, is he serious right now, Neil is proving himself to be quite the hypocrite.
Thank you bhaiya! live stream rakhne ke liye .
We choose to go to the moon because moon cannot come to us.
How was the fact that Landing in a Crater - so funny?
I love tyson so much
He is my favourite astrophysicist.
Americans giving lecture on sharing achievements and technologies for the sake of diversity where they never shared with the world how to build chryogenic engines.
Neil. How abt you tell prime minister next time that let us all (including NASA) share the knowledge and technology and work for humanity at large. What kind of advice was that? Somehow India’s national space agency should ask and share with “other” communities and religious groups in India? Trying to create a divide bud?
THANK YOU NEHRU ❤
The guy from Cosmos series.   I always saw him as my teacher.  Congrats india 🇧🇩❤️
hate to see what people are talking about india now.🤧😮‍💨
We've Achieved this less than 25% of Avarage budget of Hollywood Projects 😏
I am from south part of the moon. I have informed India that we have water. You guys plan your trip and do visit again
Just imagine the country that just got freedom from brits in 1947 and became 3rd largest economy and 4th to be on Moon. Wow. Imagine if it was not looted by the british
Usa always layer country
People believe this is what is more astonishing
If we are going on moon to make rocket fuel with water, guess what you are neglecting here on earth 😂.
Wow india again❤
Personally I am a big fan of Neil and I have read his books but never expected him to come India to celebrate this. All my knowledge regarding space came from this guy.
As an Indian I am sorry you had to meet this illiterate uneducated corrupted and convicted politician Modi instead of our earlier visionary PM Manmohan Singh
This is so fake, it didn’t happen. He is stumbling over his words
So, Many haters chilling at bottom just ignore them and enjoy reading guys :)
Btw who is he ?
Guys im a very proud Indian from heart and soul. Cheers from Pakistan. We are one. This a moment for  south Aisa.
Indians can build a rocket that goes to the moon but can’t make a movie without song and dance SMH
If Neil had a chance when Abdulkalam was a president it would be a great convo to listen for many of us. But finally this man ended up as a primeminister with neither science nor English knowledge
Proud  to cover this story from ISRO headquarters
I didn't expect Neil deGrasse is so huge
NO ONES GONBA ,OH, IDK, MENTION HOW FAKE AF THIS LOOKS?
Didn’t expect Modi x Tyson
Neil really making jokes himself then asking people to stop
1:49 she looks like Steve Tyler from Aerosmith 😂
Crazy how people get mad over a country being succesful in a space mission that will benefit the entire humanity.
Most iconic but was it afake one in reference to USA
Wow, looks like they used Atari graphics, if you still believe we went to the moon, or anything Neil Degrass Tyson, says you're beyond manipulated.
Probably they are looking for new places for call centres
What's "wader"? I wonder.
So fake😂😂😂
looked fake af
What I find surprising is the lack of evidence and the incredibly poor graphics
I am form India and very happy for chandrayan 3 success but I also love JFK, s speech
There’s so much moon landing footage from this to peruse ….said no one ever.

An entourage in space is a unifying force for peace in the world………….. well I like your optimism Mr Tyson but realistically I don’t think we’ll associate with nationalities but better we shall do it with science, I’d like to see your participation then.
So according to Neil we Landed on the "Moon's Moon".
He's our Trump
Neil is so funny 😝😝😝😝
Hollywood vs Bollywood?
It's sad to see PM's face is being highlighted who has literally done nothing other than from making this 'A political Agenda' and not the hard working employees who actually made this proud moment possible. Check PM Modi's interviews, and you will know what he knows about science and space.

Yep H2-O2 fuel cells are real guys
Mr Neil , you now nothing about India. so just shut up. "involve everyone, diversity blah blah" you think you are smart?
I have no background in Science but thanks to people like Carl Sagan and Neil Tyson, there's this undying curiousity about existence and reality. I might not grasp the concepts completely but I still love exploring them.
chandaryaan 1: first to make discovery of water on the moon with the help of a hard landing probe. chandaryaan 2: partial success (lander failed but orbiter was succesfull which was later on used by chandaryaan 3 to communicate with earth) chandaryaan 3: first to make a successful soft landing near the lunar south pole (would have been second if the russian probe was able to successfully land but it faced similar problems to chandaryaan 2's lander). I still kinda feel like investing 8 million more into a RTG would be pretty great considering that  the indian government just pardoned an Indian oligar's loan which was alone 1.4 million that year. so sad to hear that they couldn't support science over a rich business man. still grateful for the selfless employees at ISRO who weren't even getting paychecks yet worked on the chandaryaan 3 thats how scientist should be devoted towards science .
Props to Today media for not trying to pull India unlike BBC NEWS instead be respectful and inquisitive. Much love from India❤❤

So basically the British landed on the moon as this was not based on science native to India.
I hate to admit but when someone used to ask me 10yrs back.. where was I from? I used to avoid saying India for some reason.  Now I proudly say I am from INDIA.. India is leading the world in so many sectors. I am proud to say I am from India.
Congratulations India..

With a minimum budget from the start india entered space mission so many people laughed can' it be possible, here brain comes to play.
What a bunch of clowns
All space missions are and must be for the whole humanity. We must come together to celebrate one's achievement in space. Thanks NASA and other space agency around the world to make us realise what is out there in space.

Has the real footage not got back to us yet??
Fake fake fake hahaha
I m proud of what my country has achieved, 🇮🇳
More BS. No thanks.
You can tell it's real, because it looks so FAKE. Even the chat-moderater's that work to defend the globe lie can't be bothered to defend this garbage 😂
Congratulations to India!!!!
That footage looks fake af.
Robert Kennedy for president for the people.
😂😂😂 there used to be a TV program in the u.k in the 70s about alien creatures living on a moon like planet called the clangers the footage from then looks more believable than this, know one has ever landed on the moon ever😂😂😂😂
Modi …
1) very small budget  (2) the engineers are left-over engineers after the cream of engineers left for greener pastures such as USA.  Brain-drain
nope
Congratulations India I am maybe just a regular streetball player from the COUNTRY OF Philippines but I am looking forward to Space Exploration along with all countries in the world united as one❤️❤️❤️
Oh so there’s water on astroids now?
Humanity again getting ready for a giant leap ❤❤
Another FAKE moon landing from.india very low quality video games😂😂
lands on moon, more cell phones than toilets, nice one toilet, i mean india my bad.
the fuel is water, the video is in 15 fps and there are 3 videos to this day online, the moon curve the spinning ground and the rover rolling down and I bet you too feel ashamed when you watch them.
Jai Hind Bharat!!  From Colorado.
i thought usa is white people's country
The greatest achievement of mission like these is not putting a rover on the moon but electrifying the youth.   We need the sharpest minds studying STEM to remain in India and create our own SpaceX.   My nephew studying in Grade 1 wants to build a rocket and he has already named it "Pragyan"  ( After the Rover).  This is the greatest achievement of ISRO.
Hey Neil. You aren't an astronaut, you look up and guess. What an absolute tool. Go look through your magnifying glass some more. Tell us leaders and adventurers what you find
Y'all really believe they landed? 🙄 It looks like a video game
We brought God's...to  mother earth 🌎 that's india sorry BHARAT  for you ....world
I dont understand... How did the cameraman, the guy who was filming this, how did he land FIRST to film all this?
So many lost souls, wow wow wow!
Chandrayaan 3 didn't land on moons south pole, it was landed near moon's south pole. But today's Indian government is just lying about this fact. And i don't know why other space agencies are supporting this big lie 🙄
Fake
No one gonna mention they could turn the water to rocket fuel?? So they could come back
Weird how musk rockets always blows up but not no spaceshuttle
India never landed on South Pole it's near the pole
Sheeple still believe in space not knowing there is a firmament! BIBLETRUTH
neil = evil liars !
Does everyone believe this cgi?
India🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🎉❤
Fake lies
Awesome india!
India building a call center on the moon?  Hello this is agent Johnson of the IRS and you owe us money.  Please buy gift cards and give us the pin numbers.
The entire budget of the Chandrayaan 3 is lesser than some great movies budget.
Fake
We did because that is the only thing we know to do
NDT is so insufferable ...
Neil uncle legend😅
Moon landing is as possible as landing on a rainbow... only for mentally challenged. Vacuum space cannot coexist with atmosphere without a physical barrier. Moon/Sun are local non-rock objects.

❤❤❤🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🫡
Mr. Tyson..pLz come to India and Indian Universities to give your ages long experience in Science and teach our students how to explore space and pursue research & development. We are very inspired by your lectures and passion for science...India is doing good in space...but it has a lot of catching up and learning to do..in such a scenario...plz come to India and spread the passion of science here.  We all love you sir. I have seen many of your lectures...you simplify science to make it so simple for us to understand...we need so many like you here in India..and still we will need more.. India should hold an annual conference for all the brightest minds of the globe to just come and share their experience and also ask them for their suggestions to improve scientific research in this country.
Is it real? Have you seen the Indian moon landing?
Conkratleišn.
Watching this as an Indian is really satisfying
has everyone gone mental? a 10 year old could put together better graphics than that.
To get water, you need to hide (frozen ice in southern pole's crater) from the heat. In contrary, When we need to separate them (into hydrogen & oxygen) we need Solar Energy to (first) melt it then producing Electricity for Hydrolysis.. not much light where you chose.
You mean a country that lacks indoor plumbing in half the county landed a ship on the moon? What's next Zimbabwe flying to Mars?
Wow! How fake was THIS?!?  My Xbox 360 had better graphics. Not kidding.  How could someone cheer this on? Only a couple of peoples faces at India NASA showed their bewilderment at this terrible fakery.  😂🤣😂  I actually thought this was a complete joke and had to see many videos stating it’s real and India defending it. Wow!!! People are gullible!!!
Some guys are saying it fake by seeing that computer generated video to show chandrayan 3 trajectory😂      Guys go And see real one😊
This is so fake. 😂
Can't believe I missed this masterpiece! It made my day 🤣
Anybody who believes the video is real is a fool. A 1985 Atari had better graphics. Ridiculous
Anyone remember Cosmos show to National Geographic.
Are we expected to believe the footage they released is real? Am I the only person who sees it’s 1990 graphics like a video game?
The world is full of fools
Im sorry this feels too scripted.. first american cnt go back to the moon bexause they "lost the original tech" that got them there and somehow cannot replicate it today. Then india lands on the south pole with the only best footage looking like a nintendo ds 64 graphics?. Do you know how easy it is to create videos of a seemingly alien planet?
Jai Hind🇮🇳😍
Wow I almost teared up when they credited the world for this amazing achievement instead of chest thumping about themselves unlike usa and china. Would love to see India become the one calling the shots internationally than the arrogant usa or authoritative china.   ❤ India from Costa Rica
Such a great vid of the landing too...not surprisingly.
Neil de grasse tyson literally most camera friendly scientist
Neil you need energy to split hydrogen and oxygen from water and you’re on the South Pole of the moon with little solar energy. And you’re thinking of power space vehicles with water on the moon, that we don’t even know exists?!😂
Assfistasis...i dont think i spelled that right😮
So water can fuel space ships but not cars
They should have used a PlayStation 4 controller they would have had better graphics.
Congratulations india 🇮🇳 , sensational achievement. Love from uk 🇬🇧🇬🇧
I loved the cosmos series on NAT GEO
Hes a fraud
How much did they pay you Neil?
How is it possible that stupid defeated human intellect so quickly?
Do really people believe that pictures of landing ? 😂😂😂😂
As long as humanity requires an external phenomenon--the likes of space exploration, as NDGT points out--in order to obtain a sense of unity, of togetherness, people continue to be victims of scams, hoaxes and--probably worse--coercion.
Meanwhile that third world island United queendom is spending 250 billion dollars to connect two cities. 🇬🇧
American media like a @Mad Dog😂😂😂😂
Niel sounds like an intellectual Peter Griffin
why there are not any clear videos at least smartphone video of the moon only photos or low quality short videos thi prove landing is fake
The country where most citizens don't have indoor plumbing or enough drinking water is looking for water on the moon?   Clean up your rivers first.  Strange priorities...
India`s moon landing hasn`t any quality video, strange.
So why are we burning petro chemicals on our city streets where people need to breathe? Oh yeah, the whole world runs on making a profit for large corporations.
Satisfactory to see Mujeets & Androos crying in the comments section.
India didnt  go to the moon just  like  America  didnt  go India  gets its technolog  from  Europeans they can't  do nothing  with out white  European  help and finance and  money
Now we all see that there is no vacuum around the moon, My teachers lied or were just stupid uninformed space vacuum lie mongers. Well done  Neil De Grasse for proving to us all that space is not a vacuum.
#1 This is fake. #2 How can you feel 'pride' in an achievement that you had nothing to do with?  The guy down the street who sold me curry goat with shards of bone in it has nothing to do with this so-called mission.
They use oxygen to work fuel, is enough🎉😂
Hoax! Distraction Distraction distraction!
These folks are making a wonderful living selling their souls.
Haha so fake.
I love how excited he is talking about these achievements.
No one wants to talk about how fake the landing looked?
Hey Neil can I be a woman if I put earring on?😂
its just so clearly fake lol
🙂❤👍
Totally fake
the video is nothing more than cartoon computer generated images. India became the first country to successfully land a fake story globally using 2MP low quality camera and cheap video rendering equipment. the FACTS 60% of India's nearly 1.3 billion people live on less than $3.10 a day, the World Bank's median poverty line. And 21%, or more than 250 million people, survive on less than $2 a day.Chandrayaan 3 is a fake.
Why do the graphics look like a video game from the late 90s?
Why does the load look so fake with the device? Should it only be a graphical representation since they can't record the real one on landing?
The thing is we dnt need western validation to joy of happiness of moon landing
You are gonna believe the "scientist" who predicted the earth and everyone on it would be dead by 2018 bcoz of global  warming? 🤔🤷😂 <checks calender>
If nasa is so advance why they dont made colony on moon 😂
Of course, here is Neil with the breakdown. "If you put an apple in a microwave for 47 seconds..."
Incredible india as Always😊
But india didn't land on the moon.
My Indian fellows flooding the comments section 😂😂
It is good that Western sources are casting doubts instead. The Indians did learn its lesson from the USA's foolish mistake of a show of arrogance in pulling off a fake landing. The Indians are just providing clips as short as possible and easier to fool and explain, since they already knew those clips will be scrutinised, every millimetre of it. Indians are smart not to reveal the 'horses legs' like the USA, with Armstrong and partner hopping and jumping around like a clown on 'the moon'and providing clues to expose their fakery.  More than 54 years later, the USA still failed to convince the rest of the world that they really went to the moon, not with the exposure of the present state of their rocketry and expertise being shown to the world. Are they still using Russian rockets to go up to the International Space Station I wonder?
im not buying it. i dont believe they went to the moon at all.
Firnament?
Would the Indian moon landing be another Bollywood video to compete with the American's Hollywood video? So far most of the images were computer generated or animation. The only two short clips of a few seconds were that of the rover sliding down the ram of the lander and moving about 15 feet from the lander, and subsequently made a rotation without moving further. Two weeks on the moon and less than 10 secs video clip to show. And the video clips were cut and paste together, a patch up work. Why couldn't the Indians show a more complete clip, with better quality video, after claiming they had the most advanced camera on the lander? Why the camera mounted on the rover could not show anything along its path? Why the short passage of the rover down the lander was cut short with nothing else to show? And India claimed that the distance from the moon made it unable to send signals to the rover to control its movement? Armstrong was able to communicate with Houston and the White House almost instantly in 1969.  The Indians could not produce any real images of the descent of the lander. All they could show was two patch up short clips of a few seconds and keep repeating the clips over and over again. Surely the Indians would want to show more, the grand descent and touch down, a longer and continuous trip by the rover, what the camera of the rover saw and filmed. But none of these. I beg the whole world would be impressed.
Space is imaginary like your freedom
To all the space enthusiasts, do you remember how you got interested in space and cosmos..... for me, when I get to know about Opportunity rover on Mars
They found megatron there...
They want to bamboozle you with talking and words!!  So you foget that we just want to see footage of this moon mission. Hhhmm all we see is this stupid computer graphic rocket!!  😂 wake up people.
H2O equals fuel is all i heard
"Mexico" means, belly of the moon, in the Nahuatl language, the language of the Mexica (aztecs).
America is a continent, not the USA.
India has super smarts and super balls😂 Hallelujah
There is no one history even any goddess demons of your theosofy that even think to land on the moon, such a madness
Narendra Modi has to be the greatest Prime Minister India has ever had. Truly remarkable
Lol, such liars 😆
Videsh wale bhi apne fan
It's good to see that people all over the world are cheering on India's success while there are also some people who tries to defame India just because they are frustrated and jealous 😌 which ultimately proved that we are humans and it is natural for us to be jealous on other's achievement 😌
Wow, this is so phony really lol
He sounded whole lot fishy as if laughing inside " India on Moon, Tada! Those were us in the background " Lol
Did NDT just say we should colonize the moon? I thought colonization is a bad thing…  Why is it different, isn’t it simply the natural progression of the evolution of the species of human? First to explore and colonize the planet, and then to go among the planets and eventually the stars.
fraud
the earth is flat... and this is a NEW FAKE NEWS
But so sorry to admit our Prime Minister is rather a divisive character.
JFK: the people in the background, grinning and shaking their heads, either amazed or incredulous about going to the moon. Would you have believed it?? Or was he full of green cheese?
imagine where humanity would be in space if countries wouldnt have been fighting one another.
Is this real life.. like what's with the graphics? It looks worse than a B horror movie? And who filmed it landing?
If you put it inside the magic, cell phone machine or TELEvision machine that people will believe anything.  We Live inside a FirmAmenT, I am pretty Firm on the FirmAmenT, afFirm.  🙏🏼
This is how the Indian media should have reported it.
there are 2 types of people, 1 who learn from other's success and become successful themselves, and one who are just jealous of other's and do nothing
ISRO should collaborate with NASA for mutual benefits
❤❤❤
It was great.. I'm happy for this successful landing.
Appollo 11 is fake
‘…It has to be real because it looks so fake…’ Musk
Did the moon’s warranty expire? So, who got out of the craft to video the landing?
pakistan be like : why go to moon when we can see it  pakistan be like : why go to moon when we got moon on our flag pakistan be like : why go to moon when Pakistan's  like moon "no electricity, no food , no water "
Give the indians the budget of the pirates of the caribbean or gta 6 and they'll be able to go alpha centauri
Looks so realistic for a 3D animation...not 😂
Ohhh loawdy he cried
Nobody explains science like this guy
Neil Dsgrace
US 🇺🇸stopped lunar missions (human travel) 50 years ago…  worlds largest democratic country sending toys to the moon in 2023.. 😂🤣
Unifying force for us Indians? We are not the one who is killing only one difference, black white!! We are in harmony with 1000s of difference, that's India, always undermining us and telling what to do😅
India’s power is by focusing on the inside 🧘‍♀️, not the outside.
Fake landing and all lies
I can't stand this guy. He thinks he's so entertaining but he's actually just annoying. Especially the way he laughs at his own jokes.
India and middle east numbir won.
if we can make rocket fuel from H20 on the moon, why don't we have rocket-fueled transport here on Earth with 70% covered with water! hmmm
🇮🇳❤️
Amazing
What is that diversity talk? All the people can participate? Like who is stopping anyone dude? When you talk about US Space program is this what you talk about? You talk about space exploration, scientific stuff... but since its India let's introduce our netflix jargon , diversity peace ethnicity.. like India always has to be schooled, India can't simply be happy on its achievement.. It's like.. haan haan ye theek hai per peace ethinicity diversity ka bhi khayal rakhna hai.. FFS let India gloat, without any preaching, just for one time PLEASE
India 🇮🇳 🇮🇳 proud moments. Thanks gentleman ❤
Best thing I’ve heard today space could be a unifying force for peace amen brother
Bollywood never had as good of production quality as Hollywood.
I think we've had enough of Woke deGrasse Tyson
So fake
100% real lol
Modi is conning the world
We are a rising and flying high country. Proud of it
love you Neil
Way to go India!!!!!
If they can make ricket fuel with water  Then they can do with gas
India's landing looks totaly fake. Probably because it is a hoax. Tyson is just PR person who is here to brainwash minds of the people.
He spoke more science here than when he came on Indian news channels. And it's all cause of the questions he was asked.
I watched Cosmos on hotstar that inspired me a lot. Today i feel happy when Niel deGrass Tyson talks about Indian achievement.  It is actually an achievement of whole scientific community. Without inspiration by Carl Sagan, Stephen Hawkings, Eienstien and others it was not possible.
india is the second greatest space power right now, also first country to achieve the impossible, landing on moon's south pole. it is exponentially more difficult than, sending human into space or building space labs, thats why no country has ever achieved it. and im proud that india decided to choose this challenge and make a statement, the era of india has arrived. the east is rising. imagine india has half the budge of NASA, indians would have a base on mars already.
As an Indian I’m nearly in tears ❤
Average IQ......
Now Indian SUN mission
🇮🇳
💖🇮🇳🎉
Rare India w.
JFK ❤️
Big thanks for you guys from 🇮🇳
So proud 🥹🥹 My INDIA.. ❤
india   1st south pole ,   2nd moonlanding
Neil DeGrasse Tyson❤❤I love his show Cosmos
Lol got to the moon by frauding people out of my money through scam call centres....I just got defrauded this morning on my O2 mobile, watch out people...do not give answer to security question in full...
Right questions to the right man.
🤦🏿‍♂️
Jai hind!
India is being ruled by fascism, driven by current India PM Modi, the BJP party and Hindutva/Sanatani extremism. Minority Muslims and Christians in India are being persecuted every day by Hindutva/sanatani extremists who believe themselves to be a superior caste. Yet the world is too busy making business deals and cheap IT contracts to openly challenge India. Please cover what is happening in India and Indian occupied Kashmir where the situation is genocidal
liked the idea of exploring moon as jet fuel source
Amazing achievement. Now to unite and start exploring the moon with international manned missions.
India's story is similar to King David... From shepherds and farmers to the MOON
What I find sad is half of the US already tries to discredit and insult their own scientific achievement of being the first steps on the moon. Meanwhile, India, a third world country neck deep in religion and superstition, came  together to celebrate their moon landing as something deeply personal.
Instead of helping the poor they wana spend money for space smh
Jay hind
Congrats India!! Love from India 🇮🇳🇮🇳
Dr. Tyson is an amazing science motivator and always very inspiring ! Only a few can match his enthusiasm and connectivity ability.
Dont you just hate that Neil deGrasse Tyson ? Sooooo Irksome !
Waste of money waste of resources waste of time its already been done and your people are starving and neglected how silly .
USA NEVER WENT TO MOON 😂
Lies! Astronauts have already said they never went outside the ionosphere! And common sense will tell you that the flag wouldn't be blowing on the moon.
I am doing phD in Agriculture..but nobody gives any importance to this field..bcz we are not physicists or rocket scientist 🙂
You don't have to worry about the diversity in India. We have been living with, and dealing with this since ages. If you really want to focus on Diversity and Democracy, focus on Middle Eastern Countries, esp. Saudi Arabia, China, Pakistan & Bangladesh
India 🇮🇳 the OG science gurus
BS
India is greater than robber nation (small sized britain)
❤USA 🇺🇸 IS PROUD OF INDIA AND BRITAIN 🇬🇧 WANTS £2.3 Billion back from India 🇮🇳 😅
They also found sulphur , oxygen and other things..
Thanks sir for your support.
Best video for internet good luck
🇮🇳
Such a historic achievement we saved 3 minutes to cover it. Now it’s back to climate change trans people and Donald Trump! The real historic news!!!
Is that anchor in last minute is the same guy from Manifest series?
I can't believe lies can be this big
Now free khalistan and Kashmir please
Fake
Wonderful person with great mind ❤
HELLO SIR, THIS IS FRED WILSON, CALLING FROM THE MOON TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT UPDATING YOUR ONLINE BANKING DETAILS....
Fake news… hahaha
Everyone is so excited abiut the Animation of moon robot landing.
xddd
Congrats to India for this great achievement on successfully landed on the moon's South Pole and awaiting anticipated project to the Sun. Keep up the good works, Kishor from Trinidad, West Indies.
Thank you for your kind words on India's achievements dear Mr. Mike Tyson. I have watched all of your fights. Your first round knockouts were fantastic !
Whose the black man in the stands? wasn't it rare those days?must be a highly successful person.
I saw america,russia,turkey,germany,uae,israeil everybody enjoys it but U.K. is unwell
Don't ever show this guy pics of the sky
for people who love space , neil is our gem , love from india
I just learnt that the tiniest minority of ethnic grp and religion in India is also the richest. They are called  Parsis who had to flee from Persia Becos of  the barbaric  onslaught by invading  MOSLEEMS.   Try negotiating with a virus like Covid and the virus will refuse to back down cause it's genetically programmed not to cooperate and only keep attempting to  destroy it's host untill it's neutralised by the host
This dude is neck deep in secret society's 🎭🐙👁️👹
Bro India can't even handle it's current traffic situation without honking a horn 1 million times.
Shocking to hear your advice to our PM, wirlth respect to involving all communities and religions in the space program. What makes you think India, excludes people. Dr. Abdul Kalam, our former president was heading the program is a Muslim . Si for god's sake, stop worrying about India's diverse communities. It's lobbies and cheap politicians like congress party, which does such things.
noice
🧢
They went to the moon  in a world of make-believe. Rockets taking off are real, but going to the moon and presenting it as such is deep fake. No country can get to the moon, they all tell huge conspiratorial lies.
Tysons speech on Indian TV supports shantidoots to be included in space program.
India should put JB in that 🚀 to the moon.
L
If you believe this you need to be drug tested. How can you believe this
He's such a bad actor 😂😂🐑🐑🐑
total bollocks
Good job india 🎉
Meanwhile, America’s children are scoring lower in math & science than ever before. Is it any wonder? Their parents are saying “there’s no point” to space exploration.  2,000 years from now the Earth will be half dead, the whole place will be a slum and living off world will be for the educated rich.  Terra will be occupied by Americans complaining the whole time about how they’ve been dealt the bad hand.  At least they’ll have their guns and their God. 🙄
Lol....😂😂😂...  at least , India made the best parody of the biggest hoax and scam ever ... India is definitly great ...😂... the most hilarious " moon "  " landing " in the galaxy , in the cosmos for sure ....
Ah the fourth country to fake a Moon landing.   Welcome to our exclusive club!   AI DeepFake works wonders doesn't it 😆
What a joke….
Big congratulations to ISRO!
I don’t know, but nowadays, we should have better video than what I saw this looks totally fake. I’ve actually made better videos in this on my editing program.
Aint nobody reaching more than india they have by far a more successful and way better technology
America said we cant go anymore india did 😮 , nonone can go over our dome .
Where it landed is called shivshakti point !! Brilliant courage ! Extraordinary. Bless us all to appreciate it.
People from countries like America, the UK, Malaysia, Australia, New Zealand, and some others are making fun of India and saying that this is a fake mission, and they are making many wrong statements about India. I can no longer tolerate this.
2:00 if water is spaceship fuel and we have the technology for it, why do we use petroleum engines majorly on earth?
I am a proud Indian. Jai Hind 🇮🇳
That was a short interview
Congrats to ISRO
What a hack... these veil attacks and lecture on unity in India can better be reserved for there ownself .. despite such low income high population democracy we are largely proud Indians
When will we have the first contact with aliens 🌚
20° North of the pole isn't the South Pole.
Where is the footage of them landing?
Looks fake
Humans have dreamed of dumping garbage on the Moon as long as they have seen it.    Now four nations have realized this....  ahh.   Alas there is (at least so far) little found there to take, fight over or exterminate, but we can keep looking
India sent man to moon. But not take care of the millions in poverty. Ridiculous
We need niel as president of the USA. 😁👍
*I Wish Countries Were **_Actually THAT_** Positive & Supportive About It! ((Sigh!)) As A Country We (Indians) Do Share This Achievement As One World!  As A Great Feat Of Mankind.*  *But, I Don’t Really Believe The World Shares Similar Sentiments.*  *We Are So Happy, Proud And Fortunate, That We Have An Organisation Like ISRO With Brilliant & Hardworking Indians, Their Perseverance & Fortitude Payed Off! They Deserve All The Laurels And Our Support And Love!*  *I Am So Honoured & Humbled In Remembering That We Had Pioneers Like Homi J. Bhaba, Vikram Sarabhai, Shatish Dhawan Sir And APJ Abdul Kalam Sir, And Many Exceptional People Who Brought Us Here At This Juncture, Without Them This Would Not Have Been Possible, And The Leaders Who Stood With Them!*  *We Are Full Of Gratitude As A Nation. To All Those Ingenious People Who Came Before Us Around The Globe. Their Gifted Brain Helped Us Today And Is Continuing To Help Mankind!*  *We Thank All The Organisation In India And Around The Earth, Who Helped Us Achieve This Wonderful, Extraordinary & First Of It’s Kind Feat!*  *Thank You For Showing Curiosity And Reacting!* 🙏🏼  *One Of The Main Reason It’s Different From USA’s Pioneering & Extraordinary Moon Landing Is That They Landed On The Part Of Moon That Is Visible & A Terrain That Has Been Extensively Well Researched And Throughly Studied. Whereas In Comparison India’s & **_ISRO’s Chandrayaan- 3_** Mission Landed On A Part Of Moon That Has Not Been Explored And There Is Very Little Data Available About It’s Terrain etc. Which Makes The Mission Highly Unpredictable & Chances Of Failure Way Higher.*  *Secondly,* *USA Sent First Men On The Moon, A Giant Leap For Mankind Indeed, This However Was Not Man-Mission For Obvious Reason, As We Have Literally No Data Available About The South Pole Of The Moon, A Place Where Even Sun Doesn’t Shine! Sending A Human Would Have Not Only Been Risky & Dangerous But Also Highly Stupid And Reckless.*  *Thirdly,* *India Is The First Country To Reach The South Pole Of The Moon, No Other Country Has Achieved This Feat Yet, Russia Tried Couple Of Days Back With It’s **_Lunar-25_** But, It’s Crashed & Failed Unfortunately! (Mad Respect For Roskosmos Scientists For Trying To Attempt This!)*  *Fourth,* *The Temperature On South Pole Of The Moon Is Highly Cold & Practically Frozen! It’s The Part Of The Moon That’s Perpetually Always Dark As Sunlight Doesn’t Reach The South Pole Of The Moon. So, The Very Possible Threat Of Equipment Failure, Makes It Even More Unprecedented. This Will Help Us Learn More About The Age Of Moon, More Information And Data About The Moon’s Terrain & It’s Surface, About Water & Mineral Availability etc.*  *Fifth* *Is The Budget That Was Used. It Costed Less Than Hollywood’s Oppenheimer OR Barbie Movie! It’s Way, Way Cheaper Than Most NASA Missions, And It Is All Thanks To Our ISRO’s Ingenious Scientists & Engineers!* 🙏🏼  *We Thank All The Organisation In India And Around The Earth, Who Helped Us Achieve This Wonderful, Extraordinary & First Of It’s Kind Feat!*  *And We Thank All Those, Who Genuinely Wishes Well For India, Is Happy Of This Collective Achievement, And Think Of Us As Friend, This Is A Conscious & Collective Collaboration Of The Most Brilliant Minds Around The World And Specially India That Humanity Has To Offer. Minds That Are Present Today And Those Who Came Before Us!*  *Thank You Indeed! One Earth, One Family!* 🙏🏼  *Thank You ISRO!* *Thank You World!* *Jai Hind!* 🇮🇳🙏🏼
We have water here, pls preserve this earth. No earth , no moon. 😂😂😂
😂😂😂
Is that footage Real cos it doesn't look real to me
indian technology 😂😂
Tf is it just me thst thought the guy snd the women in violet were white in the intro then turned black during the interview? Like theyre sll black even the last guy😂😂😂
There are fully grown adults who still believe people went to the moon. Hilarious!
Heartiest Congratulations to Bharat !!
Create rocket fuel with water.... how about fuel for cars
🎉
Fake asz news
Congrats India ,  So happy and proud for them..... keep rising above all..... Jai Hind 🇮🇳👏
Nice computer graphics 😂😂😂  You people believe this crap?
That moon landing was an animation   You people are so gullible and easy to fool
While almost all of western world is proud of india's space missions, british media are crying and cribbing like always..
These are adults talking about cartoons like it’s a real thing. No wonder people fall for cartoon vrus
They sounded a little bit sarcastic ; that was the perceived tone but i don't known coz i did not see similar comments .
Why can't i see sky in any photographs of moon
Come on it was faker than the USA attempt
It took the modern world 8 years India took 70 lol
SMC FAN HAIN....😄😄😄
How am I only hearing about this now?! What an incredible moment for India and the world.  👏 👏 👏
Hi world 🇮🇳🇮🇳
The way JFK says “decade” just  ruined my day
Niel.. you got 59 seconds to talk about saving humanity before we talk bs for the next 2 hours lol
Space is almost as fake as this cartoon 🐮💩!!! 😛
Clown world
India did it at less than $100million. Crazy
I wish we India also has someone like Niel deGrasse Tyson. He explains complex science in easy way, this will fuel curiosity and a will to know more in our young generation.
i hope this time we do this because we are explorers
How can anyone think this is real
Why he laughed
Amazing.
Sorry about that unnecessary Kennedy segway
I love his passion
proud of ISRO as an Indian❤
Please 🙏🏻 ask Britain's to return 45 trillion looted from India.
Are you all kidding right now? This is video frame graphics from 80’s. This is pathetic that American media is playing along with this.
Fake asf
So we don't have rocket cars using H2O?   Hmmm.
Ir reminds me of a Scene in TBBT where Rajeesh attacks Neil saying He was Mike Tyson's Sister in social media.
First Quicky-Mart on Moon! Who lub da Quicky Mart, I Doooooooo
“Ummm hmmm “ a bit of a-racist tone.
Is that the same scientist who said gender is a spectrum? 👀.....
Did JFK know the moon landing was fake Hollywood work too?
EverRY SCIENTIFIC EXPERIMENT ISCDINE BASED ON THE EXPERIMENTS TEXTS PURANAS BOKS OF SANATHANA DHARMA OF THE GREATEST NATION BHARATHVARSH WHICH WAS ALSO Called AS  INDIA BY LOOTERS INVADER EUROPEAN PEOPLE..  CALL OUR NATION AS BHAARATH LAND OF SANATHANI PEOPLE EVERY SCIENTIST STUDIED THE OUR PUNAS THE SCIENTIFIC BOOKS  IF BHAARATH.THEN LATER BECAME SCIENTIST N THE  TOLD THE WORLD THOSE WERE ALREADY THERE IN THE RELIGIOUS BOKS HISTORY OF BHARATHVARSH..AL DOUBLE STANDARD WESTER SCIENTISTS TOLD THEY INVENTED IT ..WHAT Comedy..NASA IS Nothing IF 30 % SCEINISTISTS FROM HINDHU CULTURE Origin RETURN TO THEIR MOTHERLAND...  NASA WILL BE DECADE BACK IN SPACE SECTOR VERY SOON...  NITHING INVENTED BY WESTERN PEOPLE BY THIER OWN.... EVERYONE REFERED Hindu RELIGIOUS BOOKS AND KNOWLEDGE HERITAGE .. PROUD TO BI A HINDHU..SANATHANI FOLLOER.. SANATHANA DHARMA KI JAI
They don't even try to make it look real anymore
Unifying force of peace 🙏🏽. Love that.
Funny how they can power a space craft with water but not a car.   😅
We r proud of as a Indian American for successful attempt to landed on Southern pole.We wish u all sucess in future as well. If Indian scientists will be followed Vedic scripture as a guide they will be successful to to reach even Manhattan planet. Dr Chaturbhai J Babaria, MD
Its so wonderful to see ISRO putting us in very rare first
no wonder education in america is failing, from the top down their media and public cannot divert their attention away from other meaningless nonsense to have a proper conversation for at least 15 minutes on the topic and its scientific significance
Why aren't there more like Neil.  I hereby decree every field of science needs a Neil.
Great job, indian brains are incredible
credit goes to south Indians
Fake
This guy celebrates more than India ❤️❤️
Remember that guy that makes fuel with watar…?
Fuel fuel fuel fuel fuel fuel
Easy money for the Doctor =)
Congratulations to India 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
The video we see here was just an animation correct? There is no real footage of a spacecraft landing on the moon correct?
✌
Haha their "landing" looked about as real as your NASA kid's science projects.
The knowledge, the humour, the presentation! Dr Neil for you ❤
🙏🕉
Unity? Its not Hi ndus who have been branding disbe lievers as pagans or devil worshippers
I’d been waiting for Neil’s comments on Chandrayaan-3, thanks for the video.👍
here comes the bs: unifying force of peace.  stop living in la la land.
Only the South Pole has Penguins, and they haven't found any so I say another fake Moon landing.
Neil Disgrace Tyson (they/them) explains there are now definite poles on the moon. The moon can decide for itself how to identify his poles.
Neil is such a gentleman , love him whenever he shows up on jre
Its funny how manny not can see this is a 80.s game from Atari  Quality 😂😂😂come on
I just love this guy's accent and he is educated ,but very interesting to listen to him.Vetri South African Indian 🙏🇿🇦🇿🇦🙏🇮🇳🙏
If you believe those terrible CGI cartoons are real, well, you're the problem.  Better hoard TP, get masks and jab up... cuz pi is coming!  DITRH.
Neil knew the country in divided on ethnic and caste backgrounds that's why heade that joke
People actually think this is real haha you all got played again!!!
Poo on the moon
Neil De grasse is a great space scientiest but he is not great social scientist when talking about Indian social fabric and its politics.
of course, ignore the hunger, poverty, crimes on the earth, and NO need to invest and work harder to solve those problems on earth.. just go to the moon! Very smart choice guys! Well done!
Finally maybe we can put a man on the moon.  Forget the unbelievable fake landings done in ancient times that cannot be duplicated today!!!
He's laughing because he knows he's trolling tf out of y'all. He doesn't even believe what he is saying. The dude is a puppet
((apollo 11 press conference )) when 3 hero of humanity come back from moon
Pity india didnt spend that money on its starving people
Its funny that now suddenly water or h2o is a perfect rocketfuel, but we still dont have cars that run on water. 🤔🤷‍♂
basically is just an hard mode for lunar landing, nothing particular
Why would you invite Neil to talk for 2 minutes!?!? Every News Channel in the US is the same. No surprise why Americans can´t name a book or a country when asked on the streets.
In 2023,the great Russia missed landing,wonder how 61years back usa ,(in first attempt? )Landed with people in it
Glad to hear that from sir neil tyson i am big fan of cosmos series 😊
Can they use the money to clean up their streets in Delhi?
Man! Neil puts it together so well!
Where the sun don't shine...oh stop it Neil😂😂😂
Technical,  Russia was the first nation to CRASH  land on the south of moon.
They managed to land the ship from atari astroids...lol
I used to take Niel Degrasse seriously until I found out he was woke.
Just the fact that choice of words used kind of reflect the mindset of the individual he could've started the conversation by saying first country to land on the south pole of the moon but he (or the script writer) didn't chose put it that way. That subtle hint of ego and superiority complex is enough to catch these nuances even in such a plain conversation.
The Success behind every Rich person today is the decision they made for themselves, l'm so happy with a good investment, I'm able to acquire my third house recently even as a single mom at 42 and I believe if things keep going well I would retire early
I wish every scientist was as articulate or nearly. And india stunned the world
🤦🏾‍♀️
Yeah as long as Modi is present you can omit the word peace from indian dictionary.
India 🇮🇳
Just another entry in the list of firsts India has contributed to science. Congratulations.
The line- “Ambitions of space can be a unifying force of peace!”  Exactly what we saw here in India. The whole nation was cheering in unison when the lander landed on the Moon.
Are all these comments bots absolutely no footage except a nintendo 64 image there really peeking this space agenda
I amso proud of India,  my country. 👍
BUT, we still cleaning the sewerage/ drainage system manually (with bare hands)
Should be feeding the poor makes me sick
ι нαтє тнιѕ αяѕєнσє туѕσи
But you didn’t talk about The USA wanted to bomb the moon in the Apollo mission…..Americans deserve to know……
In one week time from this comment, India ia sending a mission to study the sun  Wishing them every possible success
Just liessss
India destined for greatness - congratulation mother land
All praise to India but why are they talking about the current PM? Him & peace are like oil & water.
Why have YT vid titles suddenly forgotten the word "about"?
Neil is democrat medias ONLY scientist. Always ready for the camera😅
Proud moment heartly congratulations to isro ❤
Lasers. Take some lasers to the moon, then shine it back down so we can see it coming from the moon.
It’s always the same show. I doubt they went. Modi looked sad waving his little flag infront of his face.  He probably knows it’s all just a show.  A Birdy Good Show. Birdy goto the moon! Birdy Good my friend!  ✨🕊️✨
Neil is brilliant
Take a laser and have a light show on the moon.  For all of humanity to see.  And…. Nothing.
Why is Neil’s head so huge? Bigger than the Moon.
That's how news channels has to be ❤
Due to the shows hosted by Neil, Stephen Hawkings and Carl Sagan that I watched growing up, I am doing my PhD in astrophysics today in India.
I still don't see how that's impressive
USA signed Artemis Accord with ISRO because they already knew India this time going to succeed. Afterall its US.
The part where he mentioned religion❤ i felt that
Congratulations to India's technical and scientific community. But to put this in perspective the USSR was the first nation to land on the moon in 1966, only 20 years after being smashed by Germany in WWII, with limited technology and a shoestring budget. Let this be the first step in the start of India's long resurgence.
Right after Russia's attempt to land on the south pole failed. How embarrassing for Putin.
Love from India 🇮🇳 ♥️
NDT is a great public speaker and this is a proud moment for India but the congratulations are always tainted with some bitter, ill informed hypocrisy. Muslims are not kept out of ISRO. One of the pioneers of space technology in India and early members of ISRO was Dr APJ Abdul Kallam. Who went onto become our President too. So our advice to NDT is broaden your geopolitical information pool. CNN isn't what it used to be.
India is not 3rd world any more
But forgot to build toilets 😂
I just love watching tyson 😂
When was the last time in which USA OR USSR/RUSSIA sent a spacecraft to the moon? What did they get in return? Did it benefit mankind in general? They learned that it was a waste of a lot  money. ...  India should have used the money to uplift the condition of millions of very poor  Indians
You only got to the moon using white technology. No Hindu technology.
Good lord people, you can’t be seriously complimenting this very obvious fake landing. It’s not even a good fake.
fake just like america news
The colors of the craft make it look fake
🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
Our injured golden bird is healing....we are making her golden again...people actually understood where India stands
His lack of biology lessons leaves him seriously lacking in all the other things he has to say. Lost any respect i had after his last woke interview. Nowhere near the man i thought he was. He couldnt carry Carl Sagans notebooks. Just another wokester. No more no less.
Still wondering what the other things are
can land on the moon but can't provide clean water, keep the lights on or feed millions of your own citizens. good job
hahaha already bringing division here...what do you mean by: bring everyone to participate in this mission so that all parties/different ethnicities...etc will participate"..We know about our diversity and how to deal with it, If India participates, everyone within India participates..there is no need to call separately for different ethnicities to participate! Dont bring your "Divide and Rule" policy...those days under Congress regime is gone..! Jai Hind, Jai Shri Ram!
Lo and behold, guess who's lecturing about peace and bringing religions together. Lol.
Lies. Lies more lies. 😂
INDIA DID NOT LAND ON THE MOON THIS IS A HOAX/FAKE 🇺🇸🙏🏼✊🏿
....says the scientist who carries water for the democrats.
4 nations have now landed on the moon....can we get a collective WHOOPITY-DOO! How about we celebrate again when we land somewhere we haven't been to 4 times now already.
Great to see this, love from India. Yes it helped us uniting!!!!
Neil ❤
blacks over represended
And at final seconds of interview you can find the answer why this Chad pm is called master mind and smart guy. 😎
Love NGT. He doesn’t care about “Nationalities” he just cares about “Humanity”.
Soooooooo then why can't we make a propellant for rockets out of the abundant seawater that we have on the planet? 😂 🤔
We don't know how plumbing works but we can get to the moon 🌙 💩 🇮🇳
Space is fake
Grats India! Awesome job!  But who gives a flip what neil blah blah tyson has to say about anything?  What a joke of a "scientist"...
This guy thinks men can be women... who would listen to a scientist who thinks that?
That lander looks fake af. Plus, who's taking that video?
Way to go India, respect
Did they see mr.Manhattan hanging out up there
Crazy that’s cool
why only for 3 mins?
Proud to be an Indian and a Hindu because right from launching the satellite till the landing , everything was according to our Hindu calendar and the wishes from the almighty Tirupati Balaji where the Isro scientists prayed and did yagna.
Good for india
"WHOLE COUNTRY SHOULD PARTICIPATE......SHARE" WHOLE COUNTRY
this guy is a hack
USA is the only country trying to picture India as the 4th country to land on moon. All other nations have the righteous to emphasize India as the first country on the south pole.🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
I lost all respect for Tyson when he said biology has nothing to do with gender.    So smug thinking he's so smart when the biology quote shows he's not as smart as he thinks he is.
BUT WHEN WILL PROBES "RETURN" TO HISTORICALLY FAKE USA MOON LANDINGS FULL OF MOON CARS AND STRUCTURES TO EXAMINE HOW THEY DIDN'T HOLD UP IN THOSE PHONEY CONDITIONS?
Neil’s cartoon show.
i bet you Modi can't even tell you the gravitational pull of the earth in aceereation through gravity terms
Serious dont look up vibes from the vapid questions here
a 2 min segment with Neil is like eating 1 potato chip.
Is Neil even a real scientist or is he a actor
Congratulations to my country, but i think Neil is not a scientist to listen to in science.
Hehe.. India landed in the place where the sun don't shine.😂 Good one Neil
I wonder what Neil was paid for that 1 minute
The one who is focused achieves greater than expected
I hate to break the news to everybody !  You can't go to outer space , no one has ever gone beyond lower earth orbit.  Why because we can't penetrate the firmament and the moon is not terra firma but only a natural light in our sky ! Stop believing in all this nonsense in 2023, we are better than this and humanity with all the modern technology at our finger tips should reject their mind control game on us.
INDIA is a country never invaded any country peace !!!!!!!!!!!!! hahahaha
Remind me again how many people living in India are living in dire poverty? How many children are left living out on the streets, in danger of injury, death, exploration & god knows what else...... Not a penny is spent by the Indian government to help them improve their lives, yet India find's the  money to fund the costs involved in this project 🤷🏼‍♀️,  man has already been to the moon over 50yrs ago, it changed NOTHING on earth back then & will change NOTHING here on Earth now, so how can the Indian government justify the cost?🙄🙄
believe in vasudhaiva kutumbakam means world is one family. Help each other for a better future of every leaving things.  “World doesn't belongs only to humans"
Fun fact:  The moon and the sun are the same size even though the sun is 400x further away
People seriously think this is real?   It looks like a 1980's arcade game.
Congrats india
Congratulation ISRO and India. Great technology and greatest mind in the world. From Malaysia
This is so incredible! Congrats to India!!!
Indians who are living in USA , come back do something for India .
The only unfying force these days is a common enemy
I heard now that Pakistan is going to land on the Sun .
I love Tyson so much
Neil enjoyed the "where sun don't shine" joke way too much..legend 😂😂
You mean the cartoon lander?   LOL.  You people need to wake up.
I'm all in for anything that can promote world peace.
Congratulations to all the super talented people that made this happen I can only image the amount of brain power within in that team lol
Neil deGrasse identifies as a scientist, much like Dylan Mulvaney identifies as a girl.
so there is no footage of the landing? let’s just take their word for it
Blah blah blah
JFK And he was murder on TV
WECOME....👽
And who first discovered water on the Moon? Chandrayaan -1 :)
Add India into the description and see the viewer hike 😎
The next Space Program Tax stealing Country in the NASA Lier Club
Russia crashed while Indiana landed no problem
Amazing work India...Keep it up..Congrats.. Proud to be an Indian. Great job ISRO..
Imagine if we could get rid of our isms racism, sexism being the big ones. Imagine if we put all of that infinite brain power to work to be honest, we are behind where we should be. We should have already been creating fuel on the dark side of them on our way to interstellar space. Because of our isms, I feel humanity is probably 5 to 600 years behind where we should be Imagine if events changed five or 600 years ago where would be right now
there's no water on the moon.. what they are talking about is inventing water on the moon
What an insult to give only 3 minutes.  We want moreeeeee Niel
😂😂😂😂😂 no one’s been to the moon let alone India with that shambolic cgi cartoon like nonsense.
Notice how it’s all cgi never have physical recordings of it happening only pictures of rocks
Why the moon lander looks so fake?
What about Russia? They're doing big things these days.
Great!  Another moon landing hoax.  And Neil promotes it too.
No man has been on the moon 🌙
I have NEVER seen any evidence of a whirling, twirling, hurling, hurtling, wibbling, wobbling, zipping and zooming, spinning space ball, spherical, "planet earth" and NEITHER HAVE YOU.
LETS TALK FACTS INDIA SENT A ROCKET AND LANDED ON THE DARK SIDE OF THE MOON. NOT NASA NOT RUSSIA HAS SENT A ROCKET TO LAND ON THE MOON. THE ONLY COUNTRY TO DO SO IN THE LAST 45- 50 YEARS NO OTHER COUNTRIES. WHY IS EVERY THING IN CGI THE ONLY REAL FOOTAGE IS FROM THE SPACE MODULE ABOUT TO LAND POINTING DOWN. WHERE IS THE SPACE MODULE LANDING. ON THE DARK SIDE OF MOON. WHERE NO LIGHT CAN REACH THATS WHY ITS CALLED THE DARK SIDE OF THE MOON. SO WHEN THE SPACE MODULE IS LANDING ON THE DRAK SIDE OF THE MOON WHERE IS THE LIGHT COMING FROM THAT WE CAN SEE THE MOON SURFACE COMING CLOSER TO THE SPACE MODULE ABOUT TO LAND. PITCH BLACK... SUPER MAN MUST BE GETTING PAID OVER TIME CAMERAMAN AND NOW LIGHTING
why neil degrasse though? he is in no way a neil like how neil armstrong is
Thanks for such a wonderful appreciation and presentation. Love from India.
Look fake
neil degrasse tyson believes men can be woman and woman can be men. he needs all his certificates removed and credentials stripped. he doesnt believe in science or base any of his beliefs in facts. dudes a joke and im surprised it took this long to figure it out.
Congrats India from a South African indian 👍
I am a big fan of neil degrasse tyson
The solar expansion of humankind will usher in an age of wars beyond our imagination.
Water on the poles of the moon was also discovered by ISRO's Chandrayaan 1's hard landing equipment CHACE. And we don't need an outsider, especially an American to tell us to be inclusive to our diverse population. Stop bringing in politics into this!
Nice tie 🪢 Neil
that look so fake i can make better image lol
♥♥♥
Idhar bhi modi ji
Hello World ! The 🦚 peacock has landed on the moon !
The 4th country to fake a moon landing
We could use a little unifying  Peace ourselves right about now
Indian❤❤🇮🇳🇮🇳
Neil deGrasse Tyson 🇮🇳❤️🇺🇲
The excitement the Neil deGrasse Tyson has
I like how Americans are positive towards India as compare to The UK and of course it's for their benefits
If America had a good man like Narendra Modi as president, how much peace and development would have happened in America and the whole world!!! He is really a very good person. There are very few people like him in the world.Who does not take a single step back to sacrifice everything for the country and the world. He not only loves India, but tries to make the whole world better. He is truly God's messenger 🙏💗🙏 He is the one who can change this world and make everything better for the whole world. Hail to his words 'One earth One Family '❤❤❤❤
This will bring India money in technology
Bharar mata ki jai
It is one the most Challenging and complicated task to land on such far side of south of moon but Indian young scientists has done with perfection. India is indeed the Technological giant with cutting edge innovations and research and soon will be the Top most economy in world. Kudos India.
Why is he bringing religion into this? What does he know of the Hindu vs Muslim split in ISRO - unless some pathetic agenda is brewing
Looks as fake as Joe bidens's presidency..
Neil’s humor never stops😂
Only ! Not first ?
W India
Nice they sent a camerateam first to film it🤣
you see it Tyson, this is real; not like your fairytales of you   It is summertime, low news  so  there ufo's They atre coming Stop with this disinformation
Neil deGrasse what a lush, party boy needs to get some rest lay off the candy
Wow people really believe this happened
Japan's nuclear contaminated water discharge into the sea will cause rain to fall on you and your descendants, so you can enjoy it secretly.
India took playboi carti very seriously when he said "go to the moon"😂😂😂
Astrophysicist and author Neil deGrasse Tyson explained that landing near the south pole is significant because the sun's arc is lower in the sky the further away from the equator you go. When you are near the poles, the sun barely rises above the horizon. If water lands in these places, they are called cold traps, and the water never goes away. Water is interesting because it may be able to be transformed into fuel. Separating the hydrogen and oxygen in water and bringing them back together creates rocket fuel, with water being the exhaust. India's prime minister plans to involve private enterprise and grow space exploration, making sure everyone is involved, as India is a diverse community of ethnicities and religions. This way, expeditions in space can be a unifying force of peace for India.
Dont spread hatred
Modi❤
I would like to see Rajesh Ramayan Kutrapalli Here beside Neil deGrasse Tyson 😁😁😁
Congrats India 🇮🇳 first country to achieve this feat. Well deserved unique milestone in history of space .
this is amazing but Neil laughing at his joke made my hour .
Why every news reporter is black? they are just 13.6% of America's population right? why are they over representing the media industry?
Those who are crying why so low resolution? Temperature on South pole is nearly -382 degrees normal camera won't work there is so much radiation no atmosphere dim light that you will freeze to death then get fry radiation also affects transmission and camera quality You can't put an Apple camera on chandrayaan 3 to get 4k those camera don't work in space By the way india has highest resolution camera in space better than NASA
So, is the Moon landing still “fake” ? And is Earth “flat” ?  After all, we all finally agree that our solar system is heliocentric rather than geocentric.   Or do we need another 100 years or so, for the Australopithecine type brains to die off ?
Maybe they ought to work on some sewer systems.
Talk about rocket fuel, Neil was about to blast off!
Using science to brainwash people make science a religion for uniform governance. In other word brainwash them through science. Rascals.
This is so ridiculous - pure fakery for the masses.
Fake people love fake science.
Asteroid on Atari looks more real!
Really could it look any more fake?
Propaganda, FAKE NEWS!
Once again South Indians doing all the work
Those anchors are too stupid for someone of the calibre of Neil.
Nonsense and all talk
Every time someone is more  successful than NASA their propaganda puppet will show up Everytime!!!!!! If it talks .It Lies!!
.  As if nobody’s been before!  .
Neil is still high on energy and enthusiasm, but he never shares his secret though.....😉
बहुत बहुत बधाई हो हिन्दूस्तान 🎉🎉🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
JFK should have added “ And we took all technology and brains from Germany” to build Nasa
I love it when neil use sound bytes to explain something quickly in short amount of time.
I like this man
I did not understand anything he said but I get it it is a very unique thing to land South Pole on moon. Very proud of it.
Do any of you actually believe this bullcrap
CIA  backstabb ISHRO otherwise it is poosible 15 and 16 years  ago... and we know how toxic the amercans r
Why's the video look like a game how do we rly know tlwe did it this time
Long live USA and India and collaborate and grow 🇺🇸 🇮🇳. May all the gods bless our two nations 🙏
What universe am I in????
Whoa, they have entered the 60’s modern age.
NDT you the man 💯
Great to see fellow Indians take a break from Cricket and celebrate a historic success on a very different pitch, great times ahead 🇮🇳💙🙏
Has anyone ever asked Tyson if he would take an “all expenses paid trip” into space? Nope.
Neil Smokes deGrasse Tyson.
No this can't be true its fake , it never happened , look at the footage they faked all it. Lol , where are all the skeptics now. They did it for 89 million, the movie Gravity cost 120 million . Well done India
Yoo that’s so true at the end, if you can solve the fuel oil issues in the world and bring peace in the world for awhile... that would be amazing. Congrats India ❤️ from Canada
Modi mzt rezin 😌
Yall trippin if you believe these people lol
You are expecting this Indian prime minister to be the “force of peace”?? He is busy conducting massacres across the nation targeting religious and ethnic minorities. He himself is the least educated PM India has had and is only interested in promoting himself and his fascist agenda.
India landing on the moon is no big deal its a joke really
Come on...really? LOL!!!
Fake till make it 😅 go far this time Hollywood to boolywood 😅 are you serious dont see the cgi clip like a cartoon 80 s 😅 omg
The video looks so realistic, I can't believe they had a dedicated spacecraft  to film it. Amazing comedy 😂
Why does India need to be there?
So proud of Inida. They have overcome so much and to have an achievement like this is spectacular! Kudos! More to come!
So that was what my mom was always talking about, stick it up where the sun doesn't shine. It was the craters of the moon all this time, so my mom wanted me to be an astronaut...
😂
GREAT for India by the way and my comment has nothing to do with India, but Neil STOP the BS please!  Will countries cooperate because multiple nations can get on the Moon?  So the Moon is the answer?  Heck no!  We will bring our own craziness, greed and quest for power on the Moon, like we do on Earth - No change.  There is no "magic" on the Moon, we are who were are or at least the people in power are who they are.  India went to the Moon to be part of the free for all of power on the Moon, they don't want to be left out nor should they.  Also, if you separate Oxygen and Hydrogen (H2O) and put them back together you get fuel, how come we can't do that on Earth right now?
India cant take care of their own country but they going to the moon 😂
Neil Degrasse Tyson adviced the prime minister of India Narendra Modi about unification and diversity through landing on the south pole of the moon.🙌😂😂🤣😆🙈 👏👏
Congratulations to ISRO made us all proud to be Indian and a step forward for humanity. It shows when you got power , how to use it responsibly.
we choose the right person for our country as prime minister, this is new india this is atmanirbhar bharat MODI HAI TOH MUMKIN HAI.
Let that marinate where the sun never shines
American's were laughing at our space program few years back. Who's laughing now?  ISRO is far better than NASA.
Our prophet s.a.w was the first man on the moon
Ndt need to keep his lectures on diversity bs out of ISRO.
Wow go India 🎉
Moon? Stop with the lies.
They should stop calling it india and call it Hindustan
This has to be a joke
😂
People believe this 😂
This is the first time in a long time that Neil did not talk about himself.
Looks like the camera most people film bigfoot with is used here
I still have my doubts on whether or not Americans had actually been there. 50 years later it seems a helluva job to be done safely.
Yes you need to find water to make Big Gulps and Slushies for the moon's first 7/11. Thank you come again.
“Where the Sun Dont Shine”😂😂
THIS GUY WANTED DESPERATELY TO LAND  ON THE TWO MOONS OF OF MARILYN MONROE"  👌👌😁😁😁  😁😁😁🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂  WHERE HE WANTED TO LAND EVERY TIME AFTER 9:00 PM   SOME TIMES ON THE NORTH , SOMETIMES AT CENTER AND MOST OF THE TIME AT SOUTHERN SIDE   OF THE MOON 👌👌😁😁🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Finding water on moon is soo important because water or H²O can be used as rocket fuel.  And why is it important, we have plenty of water on earth, we can make fuel here???  Well humanity is planning to make moon it's launching pad for for deep space. Countries are planning to build permanent bases on moon and they are gonna need fuel to run.   Carrying fuel from earth to moon is 1st too costly and the quantities that the biggest rocket today can carry are very less.  Not to mention rockets themselves consumes a lot of fuel trying to escape earth's gravitational field.   So if we find water on moon, we can have a fuel source available locally and water can be made into fuel using electricity, which can be generated from solar pannels.
Great job ISRO 🇮🇳❤
Less bad jokes, less self serving mumbo, more facts and information.  Sure do miss Carl Sagan - atleast he kept to the facts
why is this man so jittery?
universe is one home !
At least Americans were appreciative
🇮🇳
Proud moments for  India.🎉🎉🙏Congratulations to ISRO & the team 🙏🙏
Congratulations to india
its false that man landed on moon ,,, afeter 50 years saince technology  traing to launge a mechine in moon ,,, if man was landed now it was easy to go and come bak to moon ,,,
NOBODY HAS LANDED ON THE MOON⁉️This lie is getting OLD🤡🤡🤡
I can’t even take him serious anymore .
Tyson is 100% Indian
What was that, it's no wonder my local news outlet only covered this stuff for about thirty seconds before they covered the local flower festival.
INDIA🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🎉❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
So qhy arent we using wayer to power our cars? 🤔
WE DID IT REDDIT!!!!
That’s nice for scientists of isro . Who done a great job in minimum budget . What a team bravo
Gawd - please DON'T mess with the water on the moon Bharat mata (or anyone else).
"Not because Marilyn was easy, but because I was hard." - JmfK
Fake news
I always thought he was a *real* scientist. Turns out he's one of those $cientists.
There’s Neil again.
As indian i think we should invest in R & D of our Vimanas
I think its easier for India going to the moon than Neil has for not laughing at his own "jokes"
Another fake moon landing..
What a liar
2:15 That's Prime Minister Modi Of India With Highest 71% Approval Rating Great Son Of Ma Bharati🇮🇳❤
And this is the India our people dreamt of.... it's historic! ❤🇮🇳
Omg the difference between the Youtube comment section and the Instagram comment section is mindblowung 😂😂
Fake. Even a kid can see that
Neil cracking up at his own dad joke had me weak😂😂
water in south pole of the moon ? If we nuke it can we change the moon climate?
India doing what America couldn’t 👌🏼
Long Live ISRO 🚀🇮🇳❤️ Long Live PM MODI 🇮🇳❤️🙏
Land that rocket where the sun don’t shine.
Good
News anchors are actors lol fake fake just fake lol dont be fooled my sheeps
our ambitons in space can be the greatest forces of peace.
Lol
These types of shows are perfect for NDT and his ego 😊
Thank you sir.. we appreciate it
Everything thing he said comes exactly from where the sun doesn't shine. Man, they just can't quit even after the cat got out of the bag a long time ago! Wow.
"For the LORD giveth wisdom: out of His mouth cometh knowledge and understanding." Proverbs 2:6!
Why do you mean us 4th nation
Fake as 9 bob note
😂😂😂😂😂😂
As Neil Armstrong said , it's a leap for the entire humanity
we need to wait for another 30 years to confirm this was fake 🤦‍♂️
How does he keep a straight face over this fake BS
In America we have a dictator trying to jail his political opponents because he cannot win a presidential election and these TV muppets are talking about ’peace’
Thank God he didn't use that BS stardust line.....JHC....
No body cares what he thinks.
India is the new China. I just hope they can play nice and not threaten and becoming a China in terms to disrespect the world and try to bully.
India❤️🫶 Feeling proud😍
so you can make fuel with water? ...careful Neil... don't say that again
Good job 👏👏👏😎
Greed - let that marinate. So, so many people are selfish. It's all about what they want. Do you not have enough s*** already?
So the man just said we can make water into fuel...or he actually said we do use water for fuel...so why can we use it for fuel..hmm
Y’all don’t actually believe that Atari video was real
Nearly half of India's 1.2 billion people have no toilet at home, but more people own a mobile phone, according to the latest census data. Only 46.9% of the 246.6 million households have lavatories while 49.8% defecate in the open. The remaining 3.2% use public toilets.
The comedy is rubbing off on Neil, Thank ya Chuck Nice
Neil is showing shine of jealous, I think he doesn't want other countries for to step space except USA, hypocrite ( his laughing show every it's not even funny to laugh) i
Respects India for your scientific achievements in your spatial programs. Indian people is so amazing. Greetings from Romania. Namaste Bharat!
Isro ❤
i LOVE  Neil DeGrasse Tyson. i wonder when his next  book is coming out....
ISRO stubs the world and surely many got butthurt by its achievements 😂
I'm so proud of Neil De grass for representing people of Colour in Astrophysics. So proud of you, shows us that we are intelligent 👏👏👏 Again Congratulations India, well done 🇮🇳🎊🎊🎊
Clearly India needs to work on their CGI. It’s nowhere near as advanced as NASA fakery.
Neil sir ..what a beautiful explanation ❤
Govinda jaya jaya
Amazing Neil Dregrasse to tell PM Modi how important peaceful nation is for progress. He needs to be reminded that every day❤
Faker than the last moon landing
Supplicibus Pannor Decca Parabulis Indis.
🎉
170 million indian lived in poverty
The money spent on India's moon landing could have been spent on more practical things in their country. A massive country wide information drive about the benefits of Deodorant will not just benefit India but also The Entire Planet.🤮🤭
And water / ice there may contain some alien microbial life forms..🦠🪱🕷🥶
*The American narrative about apollo is not true. No man has ever put his foot on the moon. I am not a CONSPIRAIST! However, it seems so hard that a half century ago they could do it, but now with all the technology they have, they can't! As you see with the Indian probe, making a successful soft landing is is so hard and stressful for just a machine, let alone for men AND return them back safely! How exactly? It is time for Americans to spill the bean!*
Can we talk about how this looks like an early 2000s CGI?
The landing was fake. Neil is a fake. It was all done with models and CGI.
Of they got to the moon why they show us computer animations
Fake moon 🌚🌚🌚🌚🌚🌚
power of media.
Funny the landed where telescopes could not see it .
A succes for all Black People 🙏🏽🕉️
Cost of the project is very less than Hollywood movie
another tale
When the america go to the moon it will be no peace there.😅😅.They will begin to fight for territories 😂😂
India is on the Moon. Chandrayaan 3 making India the first country in the world to land on  moon's south pole. 🧡🇮🇳💚
Congratulations India
Big Fan Neil.... ❤️ From 🇮🇳
India should fix the poor peoples problem b4 they waste money
Jai Hind🇮🇳
I love listening to Tyson lie about space, it’s very cathartic.
Where's the diversity in this show? Its an all black show. I don't mean New Zealanders.
India's Pride chandrayaan- 3. 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳. I L❤VE my new India. Congrats Team ISRO. Jai Hind 💚 Bande Mataram.
Why does anyone still take this hack seriously?
We don't need lecture on unity in diversity. The world should learn from us on that topic. But I like this gentleman, he is speaking from a time when he didn't get it in his own country, so his message is well intended.
Indias "Houston we have a problem, our ship has lost total control and has crashed somewhere in the south pole of the moon."  World: "wow, Indians are so advanced"
If India does such amazing achievement that's for humanity and If superpower country does that is for their own country... Hypocrisy at its level best...
So water can be used as fuel on spacecrafts but not for vehicles here on earth?? Hmmm brilliant!
Proud Indian.... 🇮🇳
Oh ya... dont worry... We all trust Neil DeGrasse ha!!🙄🤦‍♂️
1:30 thats Luna 25.
I like your speech Niel. Because you just mentioned what you have told to Mr. Modi about the diversity of India...Modi himself doesn't know the meaning of it. Our country 🇮🇳 will reach more heights with together... that's our dream.
Landing On the South Pole is more difficult than the Equator, Since gravitional pull at poles is much higher compared to equator.
This ultra nerd legend explains it better so we noob nerds can understand 😁
Neil deGrasse Tyson is an absolute science and astronomy legend. As an Indian who's been viewing multiple videos of Neil for many years as well as his cameos on The Big Bang Theory (a favourite show of mine), it feels great to see him acknowledge India's scientific achievements on a public forum. 😊
So now we are all gonna start getting scam calls from their new lunar call center.........Great.
jai hind❤🔥🔥🔥
Is everyone daft....that landing looked faker than USA 's fake landing
Light bulb 💡 Why aren't we using that rocket fuel technology in cars?
Proud to be an indian
India had to travel through the PLASMASPHERE.  What is the Temperature in the Plasmasphere?
Great detailed knowledge 🎉
India's lunar lander has *significantly more instruments for scientific research* than Russia's failed Luna 25 lander.  Unlike Russia, India will be doing real research to help future exploration of the moon.  *Congratulations to India!* 🚀
It's doubtful the Soviets achieved anything since the State Department forwarded them blue prints to our space shuttle.  😂
Indian PM has killed more people then Putin & OBL... Shame on scientific community to participate & accommodate Butcher of Gujarat
*I don't think having a "scientist"... who can't define what a woman is... on any platform... to promote "SCIENCE"... is a win... just saying.*
Thanks for recognizing our efforts and achievements
But USA sent humans to the moon like 54 years ago in 1969😂....why is this even news then? Unless... It was all a hoax
Whoever thinks anything landed on the moon watching ps2 graphics deserves their taxes stolen
Its that great they show you less than 3 seconds of clip and talk the rest.  People falling for cgi, funny how the camera was there first to film them landing?
And just see BBC, they still live in 17nth century, lol😁😁😁😁😁😂🤣😂🤣😂
It's doubtful the Soviets achieved anything since Luna 15?  😵😵‍💫
Proud of ISRO 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🖖🙋🙋‍♀️🙋‍♂️🙋‍♂️
God bless America and thanks for helping India
Neil is my inspiration... Huge respect from an Indian. Cosmos is the best science show ever !!!
yeah , but no man on the moon right ? cause thats not possible.
India - called as  "Unified Force of the East" "Fine Force of the east"  By -West   👍
India❤🎉
This reminds me of how bad the effects were for the first nasa missions to the moon.
you sound vaccinated ...😂😂
People this is not real. please use your discernment. They are making lots of money pretending to do things.
fantastic achievement, congratulations to a great country! besides having a new spacecraft on the moon, they have some unbelievable young chess players that are shaking up the top echelons of the chess world... but it's pretty common knowledge that them Indians is smart! 😃
So what he said is we can create rocket engines of water, so we can run our cars on water... Think about that
Neil was the perfect guy to get lol
2 people didn't understand! Both Neil deGrasse Tyson and the andh bakths!  All the andh bakths commenting here perhaps didn't understand when deGrasse Tyson said India within stands for peace of diverse communities and religions.   And ironic it is, deGrasse Tyson himself didn't know! When he shook hands with pm Modi, little did he know what he stood for? That is the exact opposite of what he said and wished about India!!   So andh bhakts...continue staying andh bakths!! None can help you!  It's your curse!! 😂😂
Right. So USA and USSR engaged in space race as an unifying force. This venomous posture of self righteousness is irritating
Why do u americans think we don't have ethnic and religious peace here  , I mean what source do u refer to 😂😂😂
A big fan of NDG! Love how he cracks himself up with his explanations 😂
So we can make hydrogen engines for space but not for cars?
no news here. just a fake looking VR lander and a few other FPV frames that jitter and look even more fake
Maybe before the have big plans for the moon, they need to invest in catching all the phone scammers calling from their country into USA, Australia, Europe and the UK,  they're stealing millions from the elderly. What has India done about it? Not much I think. They disguise their heavy accents with American names. Unfortunately, people fall for it. I appreciate all cultures and people, but why so many phone scammers from India. I get that they are a poor country, but it's no excuse, they can do better.
You only believe this If You took the magic juice
The visuals of that Landing are extremely fake
Neil deGrasse Tyson I'm your big fan from India. Love you man. You changed my view about this World and Universe.
The JFKD speech..... was not only for USA but for all the fighters....
Rajesh Koothrapalli says hello to Mike Tyson's little sister!
100 million people wiping their butts with their hands, crapping in the ocean, and living in poverty. Money well spent India!
Yeah yeah, of course they landed on the moon. 🙄
Neil makes the world a better place just by sharing his thoughts and knowledge.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 that's good you people who actually believe this are the seeds not needed for future
Now the hindutva claim shivalingam have been found on the moon and they actually have been to the moon during their vedic era.
yo this BET?
Amazing feat! If only it was real…
We are the Indian  Peaceful community  Respect to all international prestige..❤
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂wow... that's the biggest lie & liar ever
Unfortunately they used Bollywood CGI. Blue beam conditioning is getting farcical. Stock up on colloidal silver and protect your stapes bones 🪬
Why did you even get NDT there for a minute. He has tons of knowledge and not sure if he can express within such short time.
I’m all in favor of further exploration of the moon but this justification of water we can turn into fuel seems like a complete fantasy for at least 50-100 years.
Let’s use water instead of fossil fuels
Glad black science man just told us we can drink water.
Cause the penguins are there! … where the sun don’t shine! mmmm
We're sooooo proud of our country
Congrats 👏 India 🇮🇳 from Greece 🇬🇷
Where is the camera ? its 2023 ....
first interaction with moon men will go like  : pleaz show me  vagene or anything you have there
No one can stop us.
He literally has to tell himself to stop laughing at his own joke 😂
I am loving this so much!! Congratulations India, such an amazing place to be in history!
Congratulations to India 🇮🇳
Don’t you think it was all AI simulated. We know India tried to make jet fighter but never succeeded.
Wow India released prgyan rover moon walking video...clear video now
Why is everyone black, do white people not exist?
Fake news.
Any one getting advice from Tyson should be sent to the moon
❤
So did they have multiple spaceships to take pictures? Also weird how bright it is on the surface of the moon, wonder what time of day it was on the moon?
Congrats India. And congrats Neil. Tie game always on point. 😅
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA. This is so fake. No one here has seen the ladning and the CGI? Wow.
Did they get out and walk around?
India W fr
Did u.s. really   land on the moon with a crew on it ?
Neil deGrasse Vegeta hairline
Sapce to unify human beings? Yes but Indian Wisdom dictates if there is a cause there is an end to it.
it's not just another moon landing, SOUTH POLE that does matter
earth is flat, The reason they banned all flat earth videos is cause it is true, God is real, NASA and mainstream medicine and science is controlled by satanic atheists. Censorship is satanic. God will judge liars with the lake of fire. Believe and turn from sin and be saved.
Liars
Congrats Modi
And the best about Our Chandrayan 3 is we've dedicated this to entire humanity not only to India. And ISRO will make entire World shock With its upcoming project
What a shame US wasted 180 billion dollar just to satisfy their ego in cold war , if they have used the money to do missions for scientific benifits we might had  a base on moon today.
Fake, fake, fake.
Context " they asked Neil if he likes chai"
Americans have open and friendly mindset unlike Europeans
Indias furure missions:  1.Moon mission✅️ 2. Sun mission(lanch within 10 days from now) 2024:  1. Mars( success of 1st mission(2013)) 2.VENUS 3.NISAR(Nasa and isro collaboration) 2025: 1.Gaganyan : 3 of our astronauts will go to space 2.LUPEX: (JAPAN AND ISRO collaboration----MOON)
Just remember they'll never use the H2O/rocket fuel for our cars only for space ships.   If they did oil would drop down to $1 a barrel.
Ok fool😅
Hard to believe we ever went when we haven't been back. In everything we've done in history, we always kept doing once we did it once. Now we get a 3d animation of india landing on the moon? lul oooook
Congrats to India. Well done.
Hold up Neil you telling me that humanity uses nitrogen and oxygen to Travel to outer space and land on the moon being the cleanest form of Engine fuel know to man but the world still decides to burn gasoline and pollute the earth to drive to our closest destinations ??
The united state astronauts can do many things in a few years. However, they purposely delay it, tho.it's all about money
If they dont find the American flag and landing zone. It was all a lie. How come they didnt sent a man there?????????
Try to make everybody involved coz india is a diverse country. We exactly know what he was talking about.
Will US jail Modi if he is no longer the Indian PM and the case against him for genocide and crime against humanity reactivated in the US courts?
To all people, who are advising india to invest on improving poverty, so listen Space is the next frontier, we wont let it go ,for some poor people who keep breeding 5 children Reply
Will De Grasse embrace Hindutva supremacist ideology actively promoted by Modi, the BJP being the natural daughter of the Hindutva supremacist RSS organization?
Can this channel confirm why university students in Ghana oppose the installation of a Gandhi statute and they won ?
Can this news channel confirm that Mahatma Gandhi when he was in kwazulu Natal in South Africa referred to the blacks there as Kaffirs and Indian origin South Africans cannot travel in the same train compartment with the blacks?
I’m not slightly convinced this happened
Congrats to Iindia. I hope they have the instruments to FIND the water they seek. Even MORE important, I hope Modi will share with his non-Hindu brethren...😑
America never landed on the moon
IMO: Neil is a unifying force of peace! Every time I hear him speak, he makes me smile.  🙂 Beyond all that: WHY are the animations/graphics SOOOO terrible?!?! 😅  Cmon... Unreal Engine is FREE!!  😛
Why not US which is fighting with China not outsource all their political institutions to Indians? Vivek Ramasawmy is already here!!
Will De Grasse go to India for a post of junior engineer at ISRO? 😂
Well done India!
1:24 something tells me he's been saving that joke for a while
They sound like they are talking to Grade School students
Nasa SpaceX and China make an effort and show 10-15% real video at least. India's big moment and they can't produce a few gopro's to mix in with the comically poor animations.  India announces to the world it's meteoric rise into the BiG GRiFT like late 60's NASA....what an embarassment to do so with cgi toon tech a good three decades behind the 3 industry leaders.  Be careful India, the big three have a good thing going, make the effort or end up geostationary debris:-)
This is Fake y’all they can’t go into space No one can break through the dome of the firmament and that’s all CGI come on y’all
Love from India Neil sir I am big fan from long time ❤❤
Stick it "where the sun dont shine!"
What this flim in a bollywood back lot
Meanwhile some British figures on Twitter r going nuts and bolts on y UK should continue providing aids to India which has such a developed space agency not realising UK owes 40 trillion USD to India 🤦🏻 sick people
When America go to the moon , they are technologically advanced and when India does it , they are wasting money, what a hypocrisy , proud to be an Indian 🇮🇳
Oh, so now you can run a rocket with water, but apparently everyone who created a car that ran on water in the past decades mysteriously disappeared!
Great ...are they gonna disclose any extraterrestrials if they encounter them.?!?!
That was the fakest space ship ive ever seen wth
I'm so glad the actor pointed out what H2O is
So we can power rocket thrusters off of water but we can’t do the same for cars 🤨
Proud of you India!! 🫡 Thank you Today for covering this important topic!!
At the same time they are running out of rice and sugar? They have to stop exporting because of it. Seems like the perspective is absurd.
Did someone forget about the Van Allen radiation belt?!?!?
“Make sure to be inclusive and include everybody” 🤡 there we go again. The prime minister of India tells him about the countries plan for growth and expansion and this 🤡 goes on to lecture him about inclusivity and “include everybody”. Hypocrisy much? Please use burnol.
Water cant exist in a total vacuum!
i love neil 💗💗
Good thing they were targeting the north pole. Got to work one the elevation guys.  Windage is spot on.
So no man landed on the moon
Regarding Kennedy:  "We are going to be the first to convince the world a Hollywood set is real"  Not saying that from watching conspiracy documentaries.  Congratulations India.  A collection of good people.
😂😂😂😂😂 Yeah.. Ok then..
WHO WAS THERE WAITING TO TAKE THE STOOOOOOOOOPID PICTURE??????????????????????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
NOBODY IS BEEN IN THE MOON
Why talk to Tyson?? He's a fraud!
0:46 its not real common guys wake up you can clearly see its fake.
Brilliant, find water in a dark crater and separate into H2 and O2, that you can burn for rocket fuel..  Using WHAT for an energy source to separate them? The sun? Your tank of rocket fuel?   Did Wile E. Coyote think this up?
Lol, people please
Thanks ..but 3mins ??? Really?
AI  lol
Don't need oil for fuel. Water will do just fine. Free energy H2O and an abundance of Sunlight. The Elites have been pulling your chain since the end of the Korean War, and then some. Remember the steam engine?
Good thing they sent the camera to the moon before they landed
Lol people REALLY believe this happened? It NEVER happened.
jesus christ.  invite one of the most prominent scientists in the world to talk about the most recently significant big event in tech… and just talk to him for 2 mins, thereby ensuring that there’s no time for to say anything really about what had recently happened.   that’s mainstream media for you.  i need him to talk about this with rogan.
fake news
So fake!   What did they use for a camera?   A potato?   🤣.  They are lying.  Wake up people.
Congrats to India for taking 4th place in the race to the moon, and 1st place in the race to the moon's south pole.
Tyson is being very naïve in thinking it will unify the world. Countries will fight over resources on the moon the same way as on Earth.
Where is CHUCKKKK
Very positive conversation, like that ❤️
How dare he refer to it as the "South" pole. It was feeling %80 North that day. Smh  I stand with poles of any Cardinal persuasion. North & South Neil is a pole-ist
India and diversity should not be used in the same sentence.
Who cares they are 60 years behind us 😂
@ld6993 1 second ago If turning water into fuel is possible, it should be ubiquitous and open source technology
Incredible! We find out about this after it was done. Had be one of those western countries, it would had been on the TV news for weeks if not months before had arrive at the moon.
It would unify us until one country like Russia decided they wanted all of it, and then we would just have war
Why is there no video footage? Hmmmm
Without any context, when I first saw video of this landing, I thought it was a video game.
he has a PHD in something that doest't exist. he has never ever left "earth"
Wooo Congrats to India🇮🇳🇧🇼
So much diversity in this video.
What is a woman, Neil?
Please go!
😂😭👏
G&E 🍑  🇺🇸
I love seeing neil such a smart/well spoken man!!
Very proud of India's space achievement.
Neil is so mature person ♥️
If only HE had visited India instead of trump who mispronounced every word he spoke and didn't give a sh*+ who he insulted.
That looks real to y’all 😂
Does anyone actually care what this guy says anymore
Degrasse-Tyson is a Corporate hack.
It's FAKE
***FREE BURMA UNITED WE STAND AGAINST MILITARY COUP***
Congratulations to India 🇮🇳  You are killing it in leading the world.  Also, a huge congratulations to Pragg ❤🎉🎉🎉♟️
Where's the REAL pictures and video of the moon? We should be flooded with pictures and video... but nothing but cheap cgi.
If hydrogen and oxygen is rocket fuel then why cant we harness it as a sustainable energy
Niel rizz
Neil is entertaining to say the least.  Not a fan of some of his latest rants I've heard from him.  Nonetheless, congrats to India.
Tyson is a morally bankrupt partisan, not a scientist anymore.
Impossible to land on the bottom of the moon
Neil is on a different level of thinking 💭.   🌓🌙💦🪐🔭
Neil the not scientist token guy 😂😂😂 thanx for letting us know what he thinks, very important 🤣🤣🤣
Neil Degrasse Tyson for  president   (He’s too smart for the job; almost like the way the supreme court ruled that police departments can refuse to hire officers for being too smart)
Lets see Africa and Mexico land on the Moon.
The hardest part of moon to safeland is the South pole and the most possible part o f moon to find water as ice and potential bacterial life is also South pole. And India chooses this hard task. And India's findings will be shared to Artemis program and Artemis is also trying to land on South pole. So India's success is a big thing for Artemis as well. Great indeed.
How did they get the photo of the landing? Film crew got there first?
Amazing what you can do when you manage to kick out the brits.
India is like the guy that lives in a 200 year old trailer home, but he has a 2024 BMW parked in his driveway.
Neil is a “scientist..”
Well done India.
That rocket was financed by target, best buy and iTunes gift cards via the IRS and a guy named Timmy from Akron who's ready to deploy the local sheriff from Texas if you don't get him those gift cards
The man doesn't know what a woman is. So you think I'm going to listen to what he says about going to the moon?
I think what India did is wonderful, but I also think that money could have been used to help their people.
It’s literally where the sun don’t shine.   😂 Neil cracking himself up.
Jai Hind🇮🇳🇮🇳
"Mhm" "ok"
Congratulations on another fake moon landing lol
India doesn't need lectures on diversity
looks like crappy CGI to me
Holy crap who do they think they're fooling.. India is still using PS2 graphics for their CGI ... Such nonsense 🙄  They thought we better get a good government actor too push this narrative along ... Enter Degrassi 🤣
So we have claimed the south pole 😂
Congrats to India
'A unifying force of peace'. Well said. I certainly hope so. Love seeing Neil talk, he so enthusiastic about math and the universe.
I doubt it
Why hasnt america been back to the moon? We "lost" the technology? Weve never been there
This is so cool to see.  Why did the U.S. never land on the poles?
It's never enough time to have Neil degrass Tyson on to talk.
Where the sun don’t shine 😂 lol
🤔 Is it fun being brainwashed, no one has landed on the moon ! Not the U.S. , Russia , and not India lol. Where’s the footage ? Someone post the link 😂 !
Hoda is rode hard and put away wet
Careful, Dr. Tyson. Ask Stanley Meyer about using water at fuel. 🧐 Also, can't wait to see the footage from this drone, maybe even see evidence from even 1 of the six successful missions we landed humans on the moon. Or evidence of the 7 Chinese soft landings or the 9 Russia reports with no humans but I'd say the moon should be littered.i didn't know this but the US has never landed an unmanned rover on the moon, ever. Yet we've sent many to Mars? I'm no flat earther but things in space make so little sense, I wouldn't be surprised if we are stuck here with no way out and they sell fiction to appease us. Who knows but landed on the moon, 6 times successfully from 69-72, and haven't left low earth orbit once since. But hey that's me🥴
I heard Fred Flintstone  is landing on the moon too he has the technology.  He went to have dinner with the Jetsons, he’s been doing it for years.  It’s true go ahead and fact check it.
Sorry but wasting money on going to the moon when there is so much poverty in India is just wrong.
I wish the US collaborates with India to put the lunar base station.
WOW🙏 I have hope 🌏
"the kind of guy who'll wake you up to ask if you're  asleep"
No one has been to the moon
Neil is a phenomenal communicator.
❤
Good job, India!
if water is used as rocket fuel why we don't used now to send rocket in space...😂😂😂
It scares me that people reporting the news are baffled and amazed by Hydrogen and Oxygen making up water and that both elements burn.    🤯
It scares me that people reporting the news are baffled and amazed by Hydrogen and Oxygen making up water and that both elements burn.    🤯
Did he just say we can use water as fuel…?
So water can be fuel
I think that Moon landing is fake. 😂
Why hasn't the water evaporated
What does Tyson think about the moon identifying as transgender non binary? He better not say that’s absurd or else he will be showing his white supremacy!!!
FAKE MOON LANDING YOU CANT LAND ON THE MOON LOL!
Did you know Neil has a brother named Mike? Kind of famous as well.
Tyson always says he wants to get back to serious research but he keeps appearing on shows like this talking about random space stuff.
My man
india must be right closing gaps such a engineering field.
I can't believe people actually believe this crap. That's the worse cgi I have ever seen.
I can't believe people still by the moon landing let alone India getting up there.
Yeah right lol
Sixty years ago, Space program had become the stuff of Cold War and Military expansion. Today, it is called as (possible) chance for Peace and Progress for various race and nations. Time sure had changed and toward a better future.   Wait until we put a man on Mars. Humanity will come together as one.
Neil deGrasse Tyson is my hero ! He makes astrophysics entertaining 😊
Separate H20 and bring them back together and its it is rocket fuel.. Which makes water again. Rinse and repeat.. But yet, we pay billions for gasoline. FML!!
Neil cracks himself up lol
Neil Tyson is a crisis actor, not a scientist.
Congratulations India! 🎉
Congrats India, huge achievement!!🎉  - from Texas
Congratulations to India🎉  Water is a precious resource for human life, I still can comprehend why it is acceptable to use as fuels😢😮 Even though it seems to be a 'clean fuel'😢😢😊
From your mouth to God's ear Mr. deGrasse Tyson.
Suna hai Chand pe Chadrayaan land kari. Kahin aapko lagi to nahi?!
Here's another fake moon landing that don't have any stars in the sky.
OK then, why can't we make cars run on water.
And India actually has two Aircraft Carriers that actually work, unlike Russia😂
What a joke. India can go to the moon but America can’t 🤦🏾‍♀️😂😂 looks like a bad video game
Tell them to swear on the Bible 😂 they never went to the moon.
China has already claimed ownership of the dark side of the moon. 🌚
Love brother Degrasse Tyson!!! 🔭🧪🔬🚀🌚
He’s a shill for big pharma. And a bogus scientist.
Neil's fan frm india....hope he visits smday Jai hind ❤
Landing an unmanned satelite 50 years after the USA landed humans is not a big world accomplishment. Hoda must have missed out on high school chemistry.
What a lame joke Niel, nevertheless good explanation!
are people actually still listening to this DNC hack?
Good for India!!
They never landed on the moon they never show any data to prove it.
2:35 a nice reminder about India's diversity, since that's been a topic of discussion. Such a positive and subtle conscientious comment about sharing achievements!
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAAHHAHAHAHHAHAH
Guys you don't know the reality
Looks fake.
Cartoon
Why not have someone from the ACTUAL COUNTRY REPRESENT THEMSELVES?
So, they’re going dirty it the way they’ve done their waters’ and, lands?
Congrats, India, you're only 80 years behind schedule. 🫤
I watched it, it was a cartoon.  And please stop with the pandering, this is about ten thousand times less than what was lied about by the US over 50 years ago.
"unifying force of peace?"---just wait until they find something worth monetary value up there LOL
He's not an astrophysicist but he plays one on TV.
No human has been passed the low earth orbit. Reason. Van Allen radiation belt.  They tell us straight up in so many interviews.  Crazy the cgi and belief.  If we have been to then moon. Why with better technologies has no human since 1964 been there?  Oh I know why… look into it don’t be fooled.
Astro'NOT' it right in your face.
why can’t they make fuel from water now?
In chandrayaan 3 there are scientists involved coming from northeast India to Gujarat and from J&K to Kanyakumari
Hilarious and scary all in one that people believe this rubbish
Kneel DeFraud Tyson 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
You have to be kidding me?!?!? Have you guys not looked at  the footage? 😂😂😂😂😂
Why was Hollywood Actor Neil put out there in public--too brainwash young Black men and women.
Did they get there on a magic carpet😂😂
Yawn! We truly live in the participation trophy age....
Just remember, this man fancies himself a renowned scientist, but he thinks a man can become a woman just by saying so. I’d take anything he says with a grain of salt.
It’s a scam for India
Next ...India NASA will ask for 250 million per day for Space exploration. HAHAHAHAHAHAH
That Indian Prime Minister is soo lucky to meet Neil DT in person!
Neil may have it together on some subjects but he's kook on many other subjects.
Yall need your fn eyes checked . That was faker the the Us . Itz like they didnt understand CGI ever wow
I wouldn't be able to control my laughter if I read this news. Well done to all the newsreaders.
Wait ⁉️  We (US) lost the tech to go to the moon 🌚 but India just did❓ What da‼️🤬
So proud of India ❤
Wait a minute--NASA has been telling us for years that they lost all the technology to get back to the moon...but India has it. aHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
Firmament!
That video is FAF
That's an atari game 😂
Bro 😎 you’re on crack😂🤭🌏
Yeah, maybe some peace at first, but as soon as they find out that there are resources on the moon that have value to them, the wars will start?
Your really believing this folks?
This shows how far gone we are as a people if y’all really believe this is still possible with everything we know about earth and nasas lies
60 years after America did it with the computing power of a digital watch from 1990.  This isn't some massive achievement.
Are you sure it’s the South Pole Neil ? Or did the North Pole put on some makeup and identify as the South Pole? I mean science according to you can go either way. Congratulations India on the achievement I wish you had an actual scientist praising your achievements instead of a commercial clout chasing hack.
Time to roll out old Neil Tyson the media fake actor scientist
According to Neil he discovered and named the moon..
Maybe next they can learn how to use a toilet like human beings.
Big thanks to US greedy corporations for training so many Indians in STEM to save executives money.
i remember          Vice President Joe Biden says he understands the financial struggles of working parents with young children because he is "the poorest man in Congress."                        "I don't own a single stock or bond. … I have no savings accounts," he said to ABC news!                                                                                                                                                                            All the Women Who Have Spoken Out Against Joe Biden Lucy Flores. ... Amy Lappos. ... D.J. Hill. ... Caitlyn Caruso. ... Ally Coll. ... Sofie Karasek. ... Vail Kohnert-Yount. ... Alexandra Tara Reade.                                                                        wheres any consequences??????                                                                                                                                                             Ashley Biden also recounts times she showered with her father when she was young, something she allegedly wrote was “probably not appropriate,” says DailyMail!   , Biden told the People Paper, “I do not buy the which said, ‘We have suppressed the black man for 300 years and the white man is now far ahead in the race for everything our society offers. In order to even the score, we must now give the black man a head start, or even hold the white man back, to even the race.’ I don’t buy that.  “I don’t feel responsible for the sins of my father and grandfather,” he continued at the time. “I feel responsible for what the situation is today, for the sins of my own generation. And I’ll be damned if I feel responsible to pay for what happened 300 years ago.”
The dark side of your mom
I am debunking this ever happened
India upgraded its CGI
Tyson needs to keep quiet, he thinks men can be women
“Sure” Neil…”sure”..😮
Neil ..what is the hypothesis for a man being a woman..HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
Sensational work India! We are all very proud of your achievement!
Neil--the same she/he that says you can be what ever you want to be on any given day in accordance to how you feel that day--The Scientific Method..HHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAH
TYSON IS NOT A ASTROPHYSICS ,,,,HE DOES NOT EVEN UNDERSTAND THE MEANING OF THAT WORD,,,,HE KNOWS EXACT WHAT I MEAN
They have the highest poverty rate of any country. They are not only using that needed money for their space program, but what little usable water they have as well?.... I'm al.ost glad to be in America..... Almost.
Watch the government take credit for it.
Congratulations. This moon landing is inspirational Imagine all the proud children hearing about this in their classrooms.
why is Neil here
1:11:02. Look how my guy can gracefully walk down a flight of stairs. He could turn around and walk back up with no issues either!
Neil Tyson is a fake.
India is a bit late to the party! woohoo...................
Did they have a Camara guy already there so we could get some good landing footage ?
I knew it because I heard the man on the moon say" thank you come again"
What happen to US sending first black man to the moon?
India is 80% Hindu majority country with Islam second majority with 250 Million. West & gulf and its intellects should stop calling India diverse country propaganda to convert Hindus and control India which is going on for the past 1400 Years with invasions, colonization, loot, Hindu culture genocides, Temples destruction, European created artificial famines and divided India into 2 Islamic countries and 1 secular country, why to convert Hindus as they do not fit into Abrahamic religious reality. Stop Hinduphoebia.
I’m glad they are putting all the telemarketing scam money to good use finally.
Fake
They didn't land on the moon...the moon doesn't exist...it is a big giant cheese wheel hanging from a piece of string, from the dome over the earth... everyone knows that..
There's nothing on the moon but the money they put into this could have helped a lot of poor and homeless and hungry people in India why not do that first
The war for the moon has started. Russia got a taste of what its like to not be a friend of America they didn't make it to the moon .
Neil Degraase is one if the greatest minds. Love his speeches on science
I never knew there was water on the moon!😲
The fact they are saying its real is wild 💀
India's government is allowing Christians to be beaten. The present government is very corrupt.
I think India could’ve spent that money on bettering the lives of its own people, and cleaning up the environment it’s in
Americans are large hearted and appreciative of India's achievement, unlike the British who are frustrated to see India, their former colony, get ahead of them in this field.
I love when NDT laughs at his own jokes 😂
I don’t believe anything that comes out of Neils mouth anymore. In my opinion nothing but lies come out of his mouth
I'm Not A Rocket Scientist. But These Ships From 1969 To 2023 Haven't Changed That Much.
Did they walk around and drive a golf cart? No!!! WHO GIVES A $HIT?
Yo Neil
Looks like a 1982 digital image of a spacecraft landing on a modern image of the moon. Cheers!
it is time to send a troon to the moon!
Just say dark side of the moon
all lies, no one has ever been to the moon
y is it so dark on this show ( no diversity)
Who's filming the landing😅😅😅
Wow!
Like Columbus they thought it was. China😮
Neil stated they can make rocket fuel out of the water.... So Indians will be running a gas station on the moon .....
To push this landing as real footage is insulting....💩
So India can put a man on the moon, but men from my church in NC had to travel to India to dig wells for poor people.  India needs to learn how to dig wells for their own people rather than waste it in the sky.  They also need to clean out the phone scammers from Mumbai and Calcutta.
So sad that people beleive this bollywood is true. None of them never went to the moon
The firmament is 74 miles up...no one can get through what God made.
ISRO
still a third world country
That iconic jfk speech  applause was triggered by a jfk trick ... the applause was not for the moon landing goal but for a college sports riveraly  .  lol
Separating water with a little 9v battery and then burning/exploding the hydrogen and oxygen when i was a kid completely changed my scientific mind. That and sticking the battery on my tongue. That probably rewired me too 😂
Neil crappypants
Nobody has ever been to the moon.   NASA is nothing but a billion dollar scheme.
A non diverse bunch of people yammering about a wonderful achievement by a country whose 50% of people dont even have toilets and where the filth and poverty and disease is abysmal. You go girls.
It's the rare minerals. The moon's surface has an abundance.
Indians are so smart.
Suchh a diverse table?😂😂😂
Does Neil have Parkinson's Disease? His shaking is hard to not notice.
More Take Out.
Just for the record, I donated $500 in gift cards to the Indian Space Program Call Center. 🚀
Yeah a good idea.  Indain Take out Needed.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
How long before they put a call center up there?
Wow
Water on the Moon as fuel by "Disassociating the Water Molecule"? Like Stanley Meyer did with his Water Car in the 1980s & 90s---before he got kilteded?!  Water Cars, people!-----Water is the exhaust---Zero Carbon---No Child Mining of Lithium!!!
Congratulations India
Can't leave the firmament.  That landing was so fake
Faux scientist provides thoughts... How many genders does the moon have?
Unifying moment of peace...sure that's what will happen.
As you get older, the more you realize how clownish this man is. I will say this, he has an amazing mouth piece.
I wanted what kind of the threat  they have and don’t lost themselves on the space, due the absence of a space GPS manufacturing I wonder if is a good idea , for me to buy stocks in the Garmen space GPS , never lost stocks
Lies
Neil Tyson must be feeling about 20% woman today.
Distractions Distractions.. can't even cure the common cold.
How did you get through the firmament???????  FOH
Were you on that ship
It wouldn´t be complete if ACTOR NDGT didn´t comment everything. Now INDIA is in the NASA CLUB: "Going nowhere since 1958". Congrats, INDIA.😊
That's great. Now build clean water infrastructure, and housing with toilets for your people
There’s supposedly aliens over there that told us not to come back maybe the elite angry about that.
Seems like Dr. Tyson, may be showing his fraudulent devotion to the climate change religion.  The exhaust  produced in the oxidation of hydrogen isn’t “pretty clean” sir, it is essentially the perfectly clean combustible, yielding HOH.
Nowadays anything Neil says it's just b.s. He has become the most nonscientific scientist.
Now, whether or not you believe this is true (hint, it's not) what you SHOULD be asking yourself is this..... "If we can take water and make rocket fuel, why can't we use it in cars?  And if we can (we can), then why aren't we?".   Well, that might just destroy our ability to create energy crises, siphon off the wealth of the middle class, allow developing nations energy independence and demolish the already nonsensical " climate crisis".  The world does not function as most of you believe....
long live modi
This is what affirmative action physics looks like...
Congrats on India for landing on the moon. 🌕
Amazing such a poor country thinks shooting a rocket to the moon is more important than the horrible conditions on Earth. By the way, I think it is time Western countries stop handing them billions in welfare since they are rich enough to go to the moon.
India has now been fully initiated as an up and coming super power and they got the south pole of the moon , i wonder who's gonna get the sun for their initiation.
When did the Today show start broadcasting on, BET ???
Tyson thinks humans can be male or female depending on what they feel when they wake up.  Get a real science guy to explain science.
If Neil believes a man can be a women or a women can be a man because they feel like it then he has no argument if people believe Neil Armstrong never walked on the moon because that’s what they feel.
Uiuii big deal
Neil DeWoke Tyson
So what material was this so called space craft made of? How is it nada can’t do it but India can?
Dolly Partons lips are more real than this
This is so fake
2:59 Talk good about India and its partners everyday and I will never miss the show.
As a lifelong fan of NdGT from India, this is so rewarding.
No achievement in human history is as great as big as Neil's narcissism .
Curious the footage that is being shown of the landing is taken from another source ;that means it is actually taken from another vehicle but in fact there is only one vehicle ??? Would that be generated digitally essentially all made up
In India probe lands on moon, in Russia moon lands on probe
He has lost all credibility!  Only two genders Tyson
Witchy woman
For the first time in years NDT talking about something he actually knows about.
ahahah theres no ice nor water nor  oxygen on the moon.. how silly.. that was a waste of a  billion dollars.. but it was exciting.. dr johnny
"Of what use is a lake to the world? It is of no use. Similarly, what need is there of the moon? It is of no use. But, if it is seen to advantage in a calm mind, it is the best of ornaments." - Chandogya Upanishad 8.6.2 (The Chandogya Upanishad is one of the oldest and most important Upanishads in Hinduism.)
It runs on water man!!!!
Sorry but those pics/videos are FAKE
Hes not a scientist, he caved to the left.
Any success in science is a success for all of us.
We need so much peace in this world. I hope I live to see peace put pain and suffering out of their misery.
Why was it so bright if it was supposed to be the dark side?
where the sun don't shine...😅
lottsa luck getting China to cooperate in a unified manner
congrats to india - would be nice if we could all work together for this kind of stuff instead of hating and focusiing all hate on one man while everyone has faults
I guess Neal didnt get the memo from Don Pettit that the technology to go to the moon has been lost???
🇮🇳💪
India is the antidote we Americans need as a hedge against Chinese provocative moves like building military bases on coral reefs to grab contested land. Go India!
this is great and is to be applauded, now do we get China, a belligerent China to join all of us in a collaborate manner
What are they smoking on the Today show? Seems like they are always gassing topics.
Interesting but hard to watch morning show dingbats
Only half a century late.
What a joke
This from a guy who now says there are more than two genders…
Whoa
Why don’t we do that for cars…?
Fake
King Fraud.
NO WAY you all believe that 1987 Lisa Apple computer program was REAL!??😐... They shouldve used better graphics on an at least an Windows 11 Graphics designer Program 😂
Unifying space race is a textbook oxymoron.
Do people even watch this guy anymore?
Good for India, the whole world will probably benefit in the future
Blah blah blah....where the Autobots ?
Why they all seemed in hurry. Do they have limited time?
❤❤❤
I love this man; I find his explanations and delivery soooo accessible❤
So you can make fuel from water, but cant end dependency from fossil fuel 😅
Tyson is a fake scientist.
Don Trump. Is J.F.K. .... Trump 2024
The only people / media who are outraged at India's achievements seem to be the Brits
I'm dumber after listening to this.
The public will never see the actual footage. Never. It's classified.....so what's the use with letting us know about the landing???
HOAX
Just wunnerin. Were they able to hide a $40 million [ $140 million adjuusted for bidenomics ] Rover in the glove box just like Apollo ?
Neil Tyson is a real 👽nows so much about space and crap. He was born in Area 51
I love that even though Neil has Asperger's he still keeps his child like arrogance.  LOL
Once again a complete waste of time, money and resources!!!
Just so you beautiful people know, it is the hard work of ISRO, passion and dedication of the Indian people that made this possible, nothing to do with politicians, especially not Modi, showing JFK and Modi in the same clip itself is disgraceful to JFK, Modi is everything that JFK would not stand for. Neil deGrasse Tyson is one of the most amazing minds of our generation Kudos to him.
Entire country is indeed United by this historical moment.....🔥🔥 Most beautiful day of the year for the country.
The only way NASA can go to the moon for real is asking China, RUSSIA or Bharat for a ride when they go to the moon !
Always loved your science communication Neil. Glad you're showing interest in our space program.
India has been unified without space missions... American TV shows..alas 😢
A historical moments for Indian ❤🇮🇳 respect for All scientists of Isro 🎉congrats 👏  again
No wonder he's laughing. Look at that ship lol that makes the rest of the moon landings look real 😂😂😂
Congratulations India 👍👏👏👏
Tyson: Involve everyone. Diversity lecture. (Says he To the man who sent free Covid vaccines to Global South nations of every ethnicity when the West was hogging it). Who invited you to lecture anybody, hey first famous Black Astrophysicist EVER.
Congratulations to India 🇮🇳😃 from Europe 🇪🇺
Congratulations to India 🇮🇳🎉 and all humanity 🌍🌎🌏🗺️ for this amazing journey and successful landing, what an adventure!
*54 YEARS LATE, BUT BETTER LATE THAN NEVER.  CONGRATULATIONS* ??????
The first people of colour to represent brown and black people on the moon. The first people of oppression to reach the moon.  The first 3rd world country to reach the moon.  But this is for all mankind.
Good that you told the Indian P.M. that "try to make sure that everybody is involved so that the whole country can participate".
Guys go check out the views on other videos of this channel vs this video's views just by mentioning and praising INDIA 🇮🇳
They just keep lying and trolling us.
Mr. Neil deGrasse Tyson gets excited quite a lot. When he starts get excited he starts moving his hands everywhere, sometimes if he has space he moves his hole body. It starts to get messy to see.
Lol. Just as real as the vid.
Awesome
Neil is just an amazing human
Space may be the final frontier but its made in a Bollywood basement or on someone's laptop
I love space, well-funded and successful space programs, Neil deGrasse Tyson, Narendra Modi and ISRO - checkout their future roadmap of next frontier in space exploration. The success of Chandra Yaan (Orbiter), Vikram (Lander) and Pragyan (Rover) is just the beginning and this will inspire youth in all countries to dream big and achieve the seemingly impossible.
Speaking of which hahahahahahah omg
USA: Moon achievements. plant to go back India: Win, hold my beer!!
Moon mission was done 50 years ago but this is a very creative project !
Excellent for India and by extension, the world!  India is really representing! British PM Rishi Sunak is of Indian descent.  Two Republican presidential candidates, Nikki Hailey and Vivek Ramaswamy,  in the USA are of Indian descent.  If they could only get rid of those Microsoft call centers 😊
Dinosaurs failed to develop interplanetary travel…. And see how that turned out
Great explanation. Thanks
Good morning from Papua New Guinea.
I was 1 day old when President Kennedy announced moon mission😂😂😂😂🎉🎉🎉🎉, he was so happy with my birth😂😂😂😂😂
They landed in a bollywood studio
Indian king fast contary saoud poul
We are headed for Idiocracy
Who watched cosmos series
1:25 it's really not that funny man.
Tyson didn’t inform us if he was identifying as a man, woman or something in-between for this interview
Water is rocket fuel? Ummm interesting.
So Love Neil deGrades Tyson! "Where the sun don't shine". He was so tickled over his own pun.😄😄😄
This will feed the billions who are starving to death worse than Somalia. Now why not go to somewhere where no one had gone?
Proud to be American Indian
India make the history
Proud to be an Indian❤
🙌🇮🇳
Here is what I don't understand,  why did the US not send rovers to the moon after the end of Apollo? We have a Orbiter?
JFK... Famous speech. But t always strikes me odd... When he says..."and the other thing"... What other thing? I've heard many interpretations.None satisfactory.
😂, sure they did.
Modi’s words : “this is for all humanity”
India brings peace for mankind. Proud of you India and all Indians ❤❤❤ love from France.
Didn’t the Chinese landed on the dark side of the moon in 2019? What is the different between Indian landing and Chinese landing? Is India first or the Chinese landed first and n dark side of the moon?
Kennedy had to read that?! Come on!!
That was the most iconic Lie ever told!
These are the guys who didn't give equal right to blacks till even second part of twentieth century and them preaching about democracy and all to a country with 1.4 billion population with thousands of languages and ethnicity having lots of issues and still putting up such feats... proud to be an indian ...we came a long way and still to go further until we are on top
🇮🇳 this sucess is for humankind love from India to everyone one 🌎
No more colonialism
🤡
Lol
Its funny and outright proof of their lack of basic proof reading, that they inserted Luna-25 (Russia Moon Landing) mission rocket launch while discussing about Chandrayaan-3 (Indian Moon landing) topic.
Im embarassed for those who think that is real footage. Why was no dust brought up from the thrusters, and who was recording. What a joke, the Indian people got scammed out of 60 million while their citizens starve
Do you muppets actually believe this dribble 😅🤣🤣🤣🤣
Congrats to India.
India keeps amazing me (and the world) especially in industries that require STEM. This shows just what 101% commitment to a goal can enable you to achieve, no matter what haters say.
From today... leftists and jihadis will call Neil a sanghi hahaha😂
Love from India 🇮🇳
Where the light dont shine 😂
India🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
Nig Degrassy Tyson.........
Really?! No one’s going to point out the obvious?! 🤪😂😂 Well welcome to Bizzaro world everyone!
Still No Humans have walked on the Moon in almost 60 years, even though we got 1,000x the technology that we had then. .....ask yourself why?
🪷 Om Namah Shivaye 🌕
Tyson! 👾💯👍🏻
Can land on the moon but cant stop call scammers.
India is a good force for humanity!  Congrats ISRO 🇮🇳
I have great respect for Neil Tyson but @2:33 imagine he telling the PM what to do as if the PM doesn't already know.  Neil is talking about to make sure its shared with the whole country... whereas the PM in his speech yesterday said that it will be shared with the whole humanity and all countries in partnership.
Niel your the best
homie laughs on his own jokes
👍🏼👍🏼
Excellent. 2:50
Not impressed. Pointless waste of cash.
modi or bjp government has proven again and again no corruption  and budgets are being spend for  the nation betterment  they are for India and for its citizens and with the world as pm modi said we are one planet one family and for the betterment of humanity we all are in this together  jai hind jai bharat 🇮🇳🇮🇳❤❤
If you believe this I have a unicorn for sale
China landed on the dark side of the moon as #3 and there was almost zero news. Racist mayos
1:20  He had a Beavis moment.  Where the Sun don’t shine. Then he got attacked by the giggle monster.   I like the fact that he has humor and he’s smart      Breaks the stereotypical view that scientists have no humor and they’re all boring.
SpaceX who ?
🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
even Indian's spaceship is colorful
I am glad that most American media and American people are very happy and positive about this.   On the flipside, I am amazed by the sheer blatant racism, jealousy and hatred that is being poured onto the social media platform by many British media outlets as well as many British people.   On one hand, we have a country that has achieved these greatness and can appreciate others doing so. On the other hand, salty racists that still live in their past glory of colonization and rampage and can’t achieve nothing, trying to downplay others’ success.
I like the way he say diversity and everyone to participate. Good message to the butcher of India.
They stole the technology just like the bomb
Ooo...and all Hindu, please stop with your trans pride here.
Our prophet of islam, Muhammad (SAW) was the first human to reach the moon. Why no one in the West is mentioning it? Always the same "only 4 countries have landed on moon, India is the first to land in South pole, blah blah", repeating the same thing over and over, without mentioning how difficult it must have been to reach the moon in 7th century with limited technology available back then.
"Literally where the 🌞 dont shine" LOL
If people's mind tall to this cartoon on the moon, then humanity can start pack and dig the grave.
1:22 Everywhere I look, they keep showing this! LOL looks like a kids drawing glued to a amateur picture of the moon. Shake it a little... that doesn't help at all, nothing on that is adding up! I see scams here, but I'm not a space conspiracy nut.
Over 100  million people lives in poverty in India, yet they think that sending a rocket to the moon is the priority.
🇮🇳❤
Very Informative, THANKS For Sharing
Thanks Neil Tyson, and Al Roker thanks for world peace. Great future
these people preach India any chance they get...only hateful folks will point about peace to India while talking about successes
Congrats india ! For coming - from moon
Mahatma Modiji
At least American media is talking positively. On ther hand, British Media is getting jealous.
we are the first country to land on south pole of the moon .
61 years ago without advance technology USA land on Moon without any problem and return to earth 🤣😂😂🤣
History will not be kind DeGrasse Tyson for meeting with Modi, during his US visit.  The man (Modi) is dangerously radicalizing an entire nation - I have never seen this level of hate, intolerance in my life.
make Neil the president of Earth
❤
india became the first country to land on south part of moon  mention it first
Did he talk about the ethnic cleansing??😢 no he won’t he is just like Modi
Wow ! India has crossed a unique milestone in the history of Lunar Space Mission,a  source of inspiration & of essential elements for future prospects ! Congrats to team ISRO for makinng India & its people proud & for global unity  🙏🇮🇳❤️🌹
Vande matram ❤ jai hind 🇮🇳 ❤
Thanks America... It's nice to be appreciated
Moon & it's South Pole... No- we said 'clean up what comes from your South Hole' (aka Moon's South Side) because it's stinking pretty bad💩💩💩
I love this guy  , I used to watch him in The NET geo and discovery.
The greatest discoveries ever await us on other worlds.And if we had merely a taste of it now, we would do all we could to get there.
You'll be able to see where India landed , there'd be piles of  rubbish around there landing craft
Thanks the USA to deny us cryogenic technologies, with your denial, we could create our own cryogenic technologies for Space missions.
now that india has landed on the moon, they plan to work on indoor plumbing next
Jai Hind🇮🇳🇮🇳 Vande Mataram🇮🇳🇮🇳♥️♥️
It needs a brain and not money - India’s lesson to the rest of the world.
Do you know this modi is not in favour of education? OUR GREAT ISRO SCIENTISTS  ARE NOT GETTING SALARY DURING 17 MONTHS. SO ALL THE CREDIT GOES TO OUR GREAT DEDICATED SCIENTISTS ONLY. modi HAS NO CONTRIBUTIONS IN IT.
😢
BS!
What the heck did he mean by include all? Man westerns never stop lecturing do they. Isro is based on meritorious. So all can’t be included. If you are capable more than welcome. If not then no. No reservations. Does Tyson not know about Abdul Kalam? Who was he?  Who is the first black woman president. Even better Native American who became president of America. Where are they? Man.   Peace? What is not so peaceful here? What bogus and utter drivel. Scientist stick to science. Pls.
Thank you so much ❤🇮🇳
India 🇮🇳 India 🇮🇳India 🇮🇳 India 🇮🇳India 🇮🇳 India 🇮🇳India 🇮🇳 India 🇮🇳
Is he on coke? Why is he shivering and excited so much?
We were proud when we, humans sent the first satellite in space, we were proud when man landed on the moon, we were proud when we sent rovers to the mars and now we are proud to be able to send probes to detect water on moon. Thanks to all the scientists worldwide 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
America never  landed..  All fake😂😂
🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
I wonder why NASA and US do not repeat sending people to moon again today in 2023. They've already done it more than once right?
Thank you all u lovely people doing this great conversation. N shares our success as well ❤🎉😊
So just how much money has been spent on this venture? How many of their own people are living in poverty? And how much monetary aid does India receive from Britain? Foreign aid from Britain should stop immediately
some pakistanis say its fake hahahaha
I’m not saying it was fake, but why does the video looks so fake? Like even when the craft is landing, the thrusters are not moving any dust around on the surface and the last thrust of air you see is after the craft is stationary and it looks like it’s an image on top of an image. I’m not saying it was fake, but the video looks really fake
👏👏👏👏🤍
I am doing my PhD in astrophysics today in India, due to the shows hosted by Neil, Stephen Hawkings and Carl Sagan that I watched growing up. Today watching one of those men talk about India's moon landing is a whole different feeling.
the news anchors nodding to every words of Neil as if she understands everything. lol american
That is what educated nations appreciate other's accomplishments...Being a pakistan i had felt ashamed when Fawad choudhry,  then minister of science and technology of Pakistan had mocked India on the failure of their first mission...
Great love and respect for India! What a wonderful accomplishment!
ISRO is not just a space organization, it's an emotion.
Well done India. Please do not follow the wests way of life. It will lead to great harm to your lovely peoples.
only few western channels dont try to show russia luna 25 vs chandrayaan 3 😂 . good job
Neil deGrasse is only person where science student like it.
It's amazing how gullible people are 😂
I am so happy that in times of war and looming threat of nuclear war. At least we are talking again about science and humanity. But I hope war ends too at the same time.
Mr. Neil deGrasse Tyson  is so cool and always inspires us. Love from India.
Neil, You have very basic knowledge of science and even less on brain, you have an audacity to lecture Indian prime minister about how he treat his nation. No doubt your grade of knowledge going down faster than rocket.
Excellent show.😊
So we can turn water into "rocket fuel" but not gasoline for our vehicles, interesting
So we can make a ROCKET run off water and release water back but we can’t make a car run off water?
“Not because it is easy. But because I am hard!”
He can't even keep a straight face knowing how fake this is
Better luck next time, India... nobody is fooled.
If JFK was alive, humanity would have achieved much more.
I like you Neil de Grasse tyson ❤..love from india 😊
4th country to fake a moon landing 😂
I hope, I could tag our(Indian) journalist to see and learn, how you should ask correct science related questions to personality like Dr. Tyson
Don't ask him what he ate for lunch😅
Isro ❤ 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
Thank you. A Proud Indian
I don't understand. Did India land man on the moon?
They want reservation in space science too They will never digest Indian success
It wàs photoshopped
Congratulations.🙏🇮🇳 ISRO best in the world  Bharat Mata Ki Jai.🙏🇮🇳 Proud To Be Indian
I am proud of  an Indian ❤
Jai Hind 🇮🇳
Modi magic
So much poverty in India, and the home of the scammer scams its people. Disgusting.
How is there flames in space? It's a vacuum right?
🇮🇳
Anyone believe this!!; Who made that power point graphics 😂
2:28 Trying to be Oversmart. slipping in the Anti-Modi propaganda ever so slightly.
Messes about sending a firework to the moon, has no sewage system. Go figure.
Unifying force for peace… how quaint. With our track record on Earth, what is more likely to emerge, a mad dash for resources and dominance in space or peaceful, friendly cooperation?? Just saying. We can’t even keep the International Space Station program going.
interesting that for the life of me I can't find any footage from on board the space craft and only an animation of a space craft landing so until I see actual footage I'm afraid it's just another fake
🤔 Did I hear that right? Water used as fuel for a spacecraft? ………… if fossil fuel is so bad why can’t we use water like these people are suggesting for a spaceship in our vehicles?
we all live together on the earth and we cant find peace everywhere   now they say going to moon will bring peace? 🤣🤣😂😂🤣🤣😂😂
Strong delusions
I am sure the success of Mission of Moon on Southern Hemisphere will help other leading Space Nations to take their mission on moon forward ultimately should help mankind
"One small step for India, one giant leap for Humanity"...
I like Dr. Tyson but I need to point out something. We are the country that has been banging on about unity in diversity and trust me no one knows it better than us. We have also achieved it to a certain extent although there are elements who would rather keep people divided based on lots of things. One of the greatest minds in the Indian space program was Dr APJ Kalam, a Muslim who even went on to become our president. ISRO’s achievements are the entire country’s pride irrespective of color, religion, caste and whatnot. I just feel the west needs to stop lecturing us about this and maybe concentrate on their own problems.
Congratulations to India ❤️ it's a great achievement in human history so happy for it 👍
Hmmm it’s like those dead guys who figured out fuel from water. Why did they die again? Should have done their discoveries on the MOON
🇮🇳🇮🇳✌️✌️💥💥♥️♥️🙏🙏
Neil deGrasse Tyson loves him some Neil deGrasse Tyson
I don't believe human landing on moon
What about the sublimation of water! Duh. Solid to gas, in the place where the sun does not shine!
An apartheid country that can't share meat they can't share moon landing with all citizens.
he actually knows how to explain in simple terms
Whoever wants to speak, speak, but the rocket that India has soft-landed on South pole is not a game of a video game 😮 Congratulations india❤❤❤❤
Scientific and progressive people think alike..I mean India and US. UK media is talking like why spend money on this when people are poor and about 20% in the country is still in poverty. They are talking about aid given to India when in reality India stopped accepting aid from anyone.. the money is UK government's NGO oriented activities mainly to promote its heft and 'priority' in India to have some say and stake in India...We don't care about these silly comments but I couldn't stop myself comparing the attitude and the colonial mindset still that exists with UK people. And these space investments people don't realize create an industry, interest and progress in STEM, help in agriculture, computing, robotics , communication and several different technology expertise.
Boy, this is extraordinary for India 🇮🇳 🎉
Thank you world for greetings🌹❤️🇮🇳🙏
Everything is temporary modijis photo on everything still remains permanent😂
An impressive statement by Tyson Sir 🫶🤝🫶 "Space Ambition is one of the Unification of Peace!" he identified us. Thanks🙏 to American News for covering our 🇮🇳 National Achievements in Lesser Budgets.
That too with the minimal funds ❤❤❤less than budget of movie  avatar
the only truthful comment in the comment section is mine , everyone else needs to be sectioned , cartoons are not reality nor is bending water around a globe , scientifically impossible , show me a swimming pool a lake a canal or even the suez canal that is man made using a datum line of LEVEL to over 100 miles of perfectly flat water that meets from start to finish , how many flat oceans does it take to turn into a ball of water that has no containment , you would fail science in the first year ,
I'm wearing my tinfoil hat .I don't believe a word any government says until I see it with my own eyes .
They're effectively telling us it's FAKE ... "Scientists watching a 'LIVE DIGITAL SIMULATION" cheered as lunar lander Vikram completed its 30-minute soft descent.
There are many stupid and toxic people down there, just warning
😊
INDIA'S DECADE, BHARAT'S CENTURY, SANATAN'S ETERNITY
Bharath mata ki jai,jai hind
Woke science. What does this do for inflation?
2:45 India went to moon's south pole for peaceful purposes. - The Dictator, Alladdin. 😂
I don’t mean for this to sound mean- but maybe India should be concentrating on catching up to the world on toilet science not rocket science
You got to talk about the budget of the mission
cartoons are real now , this is sega megadrive graphics , if you believe otherwise then you need a white coat with really long sleeves that tie around the back accompanied by a padded cell in solidarity from human contact ,
Oh the irony- flying to the moon to look for water while there “holy” ganga drowns in 💩
Well done India. Perfect timing during BRICS.
Why didn't you analyzed their moon landing visuals in detail?
Always fun to watch niel
Fake News. Its 2023, we all know the Earth is flat
Tyson is so brilliant and seemingly down to earth.
How many starving people could they of fed instead of spending all that money to go to a deserted rock and polluting the air on the way up
Proud of you 🇮🇳 isro
Lol bullsh
Congratulations to ISRO team 🇮🇳🇮🇳🫡  It is a Great achievement & the beginning of moon is Tour....👍👍👍
Americans talking for peace...for God's sake!!
India you did it burahhh
Are they going to set up call centers?
Great respect for Neil.  Always admired him for his simplest way of explaining complex cosmic stuff.
It was isro who found water in moon..
It is also the first time Clutch Cargo has landed on the moon...
Thank you so much all friends your gratitude 💞🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🙏🙏🙏💞💞🇮🇳🇮🇳😊
Mr. Tyson is widely followed in India especially by young people
Love from India ❤️
Neil knows this isn't possible.
This the way. Space should be priority for our civilization not wars and other bullshits.
Congratulations team ISRO 💐💐💐💐 ...... This is great moment of india and great achievement of ISRO scientist also ❤️🥰❤️
I'm from India and I'm a Great fan of Neil Tyson, What an Intellectual Man and a Great Speaker. Every word he speaks is Pure words of Wisdom, I would sit there litening to him all day and still never get bored.
Neil deGrasse, bleh
searching water on moon is good, at the same time we should save and conserve the water on earth
Big congratulations to India
I love how you bring in an expert to talk about something that's never been done before and that is motivating for all of humanity, and then you limit it to a 2 minute clip because commercials are more important.
Huzzah
US has put man On moon set in Hollywood
Thank you guys for all ur lovely comments 🙏🙏🙏
Why are you interviewing him? He keeps defending the liar + fraud Elon Musk. NDT is way out of touch with the Space program. Pop Science has no standards at all now.
Congratulations!
Jai hind
So much from the Science ha?
WTH does he mean by unifying India.  Sorry BHARAT is the largest democracy in the world. Education is virtually free. Is education free here NO. So without stating everyone is involved.  Tyson I lost respect for u today
He just EXPLAINED that the Surface of the "moon" Imagery is drops of water???
Only if CIA had not killed ISRO scientists in the 90s.. this mission would have happened 20 yrs ago.   But dear CIA - You know, Karma will bite you back.
Hariharan
I think the time, energy and resources  to accomplish this would have been better spent on the 60% of India's population who live in poverty.
Neil de grasse Tyson is one of the greatest scientists and Tv presenter
Please .... 1st at 6.5........       Thank you...  no one under boot.... We all one.. equal.....  children of pritvi mata.....
Neil literally told that dumf to "Abide by your raj dharma"(Former PM Bajpaye said that to his junior, Narendra Modi after Modi let Gujrat Riots happen)😂😂😂 He will not take that, He didn't even understand what Mr. Tyson said to him! Let's hope the democracy of our dear India isn't dead by 2024! Thanks, Neil, from the deep of our hearts for being a supporter even after knowing that our PM can be the next Robospear or Mussolini! Didn't use the obvious name because the "Big Brother law" was just passed that makes our data available to govt, and govt data inaccessible even by RTI!
America please share the coordinates of your landing
i see his 40 % male today ..lost my respect for him
We all keep doing which country does what first etc. But at the end it is another success of Mankind.
It is a new mile stone for mankind.💙
Congratulations India 🎉🎉🥳🥳 from Australia 🦘
Full Indian in comment section.
Good Ppl like Neil who wish for the world peace....I wish reverts back to Islam.....to avoid Hellfire.
* Correction : India became 4th country to land on moon long back in 2009. Now India has become the 1st country to land on the south pole of moon
Theif Country England jealous 😅😅
Proud of my country 🇮🇳❤️ Historic achievement
I just love this man...
Usa, bbc ki mkb😂😅
Thumbs up india  Thumbs down neil
I wish Winston Churchill was alive to see this😊🙏
countries have landed on the moon 1: uk (BBC) 🇬🇧 2: russia (Roskosmos) 🇷🇺 3: usa (nasa) 🇺🇸 4: china (cnsa) 🇨🇳 5: india (isro) 🇮🇳  Countries have landed on moon south pole: 1 : uk (BBC) 🇬🇧 2 :india (isro) 🇮🇳
My parents are born in india and as much as i want thus to be true im still waiting to see the evidence that this is not a BOLLYWOOD PRODUCTION
They laugh for that landing CGI.
Do remember that you did Fun of my ISRO earlier,,now you see the power of our ISRO😅not because they are 4th and 1st in order to land on the Moon and South pole of moon,, it's it's great work because ISRO completed this mission in just 615 crores rupees only,,. That's called cost friendly and easily. Jai Hind 🇮🇳🇮🇳 Proud to be an Indian. Neil is my favourite one 😊,,i do watch his videos documentary 😅
If it landed in a shadow, it can't use sunlight to recharge. It has to rely on battery - which will limit how long it can stay powered - probably a few days, or a week. Nevertheless, it is a great achievement. Congrats to all the staff at ISRO!
I love this Guy 😊... Much Love from India 🇮🇳 🧡🤍💚
People have obviously not seen a Hindu movie before to believe this. Lol
Nahh watch out for China and India. They coming for those minerals and potential drilling on the moon. America got to get there first.  🤨🤠🫡
Proud to be an Indian. Great job ISRO.
Can't wait for some nation to land on the poles of Mars next...
Fantastic achievement India!  Unfortunately the media crew that did the presentation of this historic event failed miserably.  Some of the graphics reminded me of playing arcade games back in the 80s.
Wow...even USA not doing that south...India what a VICTORY 🎉🎉🎉🎉...INDIA3!!!
I truly hope this will be the case... a force for peace.  Congrats to India on this historical landing. Very proud of them... from Canada🇨🇦
Space exploration being a unifying force of peace. Wow.
They showed a CGI after 40 days and they said they have  landed successfully! we are seeing only CGI and no proper video about the moon is shown.
​india never landed on the moon . haaaaa it was like a cartoon ..lolololo wow to think we are so gullible
I'm glad someone else is stepping up to the plate while the US sinks to the bottom. India shows what happens when partizan politics, environmentalism, and diversity/equity doesn't get in the way.
And come again!👳🥤
They can land a spacecraft on the moon but can't build a sewer system for 80% of India, lol
Somewhere some flat earther is going, "but you can't land upside down" 😂
wow. from this proud canadian I am Sooo proud of india! this is really neat stuff, and if they do detect water first ! WOOOT for india. Tehn i thought, most see america as like the police force on earth, I thiunk India is going to be our earths inner voice. I am excited for more years in space projects, every launcvh is exciting. And soon more projects with more countries working as one, getting good on earth now. :)
Congratulate  CIA  fir defaming INDIAN SCIENTISTS AND DELAYING ISRO'S  MOON MISSION
🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
💯
Thank u Neil DeGrasse Tyson for inspiring us about Space❤. Keep looking up🎉
Proud to be a Hindu ❤
I love this guy man
Neil is government puppet!
America was and will always remain spineless. They conspired against our own scientist Dr Nambi Narayan.... Well done
Did you met Darth Vader in the dark side of the moon?
Congratulations India!, Now you just have to get rid of the casts system, the toxic masculinity and groupal rapers, the extreme poverty and unequality and you'll be my model country.
2025 will be the year when world will notice ISRO real potential ..... We r so excited go ISRO
NDT makes science fun and easy. I can listen to Sadhguru and NDT all day long.  Hope they will meet one day. 🙏
So this has absolutely nothing to do with the moon. 3 seconds rest is filler BS... another Fake Landing.
т.е. са кацнали на гъза на луната
Did anyone  notice... private enterprise  space program asked by PM. ?... 😮
India
Given that India is now participating in the BRICS nonsense and playing with the Chinese, it can't be trusted to 'share' anything or induce peace.  It's leader is a dictator.
I❤ISRO
Everyone is discussing about this. There is definitely something interesting about it.
CC of this video just went crazy on India's moon landing
We need to figure out a way off this planet so one asteroid doesn’t take out the human race. It will take the cooperation and hard work of the world to do it. Well done India! Maybe you can show us a way out of our petty human arguments.
Lol 😂😆. This is a joke right?  Did you see the images they released?  They are literally lying to our faces in rediculous fashion, and challenging us to dispute the obvious.  Come on people, the best proof they have is a crude 1980s cartoon animation 😅😂
Its the collective effort of the nation that made this possible, yes corruption and poverty is there but along with many good intentioned hard working people  always thankfull to the supporting world considers that as their mother.
West engineers are of Indians cumon built economy india having ancient tech on it.cumon it's 1st country on south pole rocks low budget.hope this shldnt br newly use as kinda destructive by moon ice as fuell.human nvr gonna take in good way for sure as like AI.
As an Indian I feel very proud. congratulations to ISRO my Indian brother and sister and all humanity for the great achievement we have reached. This will be written in history of scientific/space development . Congratulations to all! love from India 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
The Kennedy speech always gives me goosebumps and gets me back to working on a tough day..
Unifying force.... India 🇮🇳🇮🇳
The fact india 🇮🇳 struggles with infrastructure, economics and technology. Some how found it's self on windows 95 graphics landing on the moon, is hilarious. It’s totally fake, no one has been to the moon. If Russia cant do it now, rush hasn’t done it before. Meanwhile Americas trying to figure how to pull it off this time.
Old school black Americans especially their academic elites are very pro India. I don’t think Indians realize this but from days of WEB DuBois in early 1900s, black American press was only pro India media in entire western hemisphere that was intent on portraying India as primitive etc. For them seeing Indian success is very gratifying. I hope we Indians are cognizant of their love and historical support.
Much appreciated your discussion. Yes this time we are there on south pole to introduce the darker side of the Moon to the world.
no proper budget for isro still they achieve great feat, the rest money goes in adani pocket then, modi cimes for selfie and take credit, and boast of shoe string budget, why no one put nehru photo who founded isro as incospar, whom modi curses all the time
Unifying force of peace, ☺️
Why is he laughing
Meanwhile, millions of Indians live in poverty and are starving.
99.99% of one of the communities is not about betterment of human kind
Sorry according to Indian Hindu Nationalist. india is a Hindu Rashtra.
It an interesting how even in a science talk an element of sermon has to be brought in, where Indians have to be taught how to coexist, while this is one part of the globe where diversity has thrived for many thousands of years into the past while pogroms played out in many others. Feel sorry to have even clinked on this link
I absolutely adore this man
The supposed Moon landing is a hoax, just like all the others. It is impossible to land on the Moon. The Moon is not a solid object. It is translucent and ethereal. You can see stars through the Moon in both phases.  As for Tyson, he is just the same as the rest of deluded scientists, he believes the lies and then pontificates on them.
Spend the money on your people who need help, not on fake landings 😂
It’s a shame that indian media is not even talking about why we landed on the South Pole and why it’s significant. They just want to talk about how India is being praised around the world and giving the credit to the PM and not talking enough about the scientists behind this incredible mission. And not talking about the science behind this . I wish we had better and intelligent media.
Huhhhh! Finally my favourite
India ka time aagaya
Yeah, but they found Amundsen's flag there already.
I love you my india 🇮🇳🙏❤
🇺🇸🇨🇳- landing on moon, talking about colonise it 🇮🇳- landing on moon, talking about a successful mission of Human being You can see the mentality of Nations.
Maybe next time Dr. Tyson could talk about the 15% of the Indian population that suffer from malnutrition and how much the Indian space program costs.
Great achievement,thanks to I.S.R.O. scientists.
Is Neil female today?
💪🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳❤🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸💪
Guys, this doesn't even look close to real. Don't be fooled by cgi.
Neil deGrasse Tyson should follow the evidence: Despite saying that we should empathize with animals more than we're doing, that we underestimate their intelligence, that veganism is efficient, and that veganism can help combat climate change, he still eats meat and other animal products.
1:38 super pumped this guy is. Looks very happy
Probably the best cgi Bollywood has made in recent years.
Neil would be disappointed to know that PM not advocating for peace at all!!
Oh so we can use water as a means of propulsion? Interesting! How about here on Earth?!?
NDT is talking about being inclusive. What does he even mean by that?
Congrats India :) I was so happy to hear the landing was succesful. I hope the ESA succeeds in its own moon landing by the end of this decade. I'm looking at you Argonaut, don't let us down!
Listening to NDT is pure treat. One can be a space/physics enthusiast in no time.
One of the Best moments currently for India. Jai Hind 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
What percentage of male did he wake up today?
Civil Rights Movement created an opportunity for the production of people like ND Tyson. And the Indian Constitution produced people like ISRO scientist, whose ancestors were considered as polluting lower cast OBC in India.
"And do the other things" thanks president lol
🇮🇳🇮🇳🚩🚩🙏🙏💗💗❤️❤️
Thank u ISRO. U deserve every bit of praise from all around the world.
And after 60 years the Americans still haven't landed on the moon...except in the movie S.K.....and so on...
Why go to the moon? Why does Bangladesh play India?
HAIL MOTHER INDIA
Neil is funny and lucid.
Let's not forget Russias failed attempt two two 2days earlier 😅😂😅😂 It seems that they just keep crashing everything they own
Only usa has landed on the moon...
Any thinking human will ask:  but why wasnt it manned? There was no living person on the rocket.. it was a drone
Let’s see some space footage
It's fake don't get hyped...
This is a humongous moment in space exploration, Congratulations to India there contributions to the science and exploration of the moon is gonna be significant to history. They worked for years for this moment,  It truly truly is significant what they did nobody has done that nobody has done that nobody has landed on the South Pole of the moon.
Congratulations ISRO, Jay hind
India, how about use the money to lift your people out of poverty?
INDIA HAVE A GREAT PRIME MINISTER WHO MOTIVATED OUR ISRO SCIENTISTS MODI JI TELLED THEM INDIA IS WITH YOU.❤🎉
Fun fact: Neil is from the Moon's North Pole.
In field of science only merit matters in India. There is absolutely no place for any discrimination in science.  Proud to see ladies in the control room. Even capital availability no discrimination as low cost expedition is targeted for start-ups. Deep pockets not needed. Really our scientist deserve a salute for their service to humanity.
Calling bs on this
भारत 🇮🇳
Still the audacity of this people 🤮
NDGT is a master at fielding questions on TV. Communicates information so effortlessly.
Congrats India. A bit of humor- Which Country would be first to land on the Sun? 😂
And here i am watching Indians make mango drinks with blocks of ice street food. 😂. Congrats India.
We want to go explore space and hope to make a Utopia Use that water rocket fuel in cars here on Earth
❤
Neil is a Treasure . His explanation is so important yet easy to understand .
Ea chu... woke hai. He does not know what is going on in India.
According to World Poverty Index Clock India has 63% Poverty rate earning below $4 /day and over 70% live without proper sanitation. But yeah great job spending millions on something that is truthfully more about prestige then science.
Where the sun don't shine😂 They got me with this one.
For such a global event, the coverage hasn’t really been reflective.. 139 comments?
Congratulations to ISRO India ✌️✌️✌️
Congratulate india as an pakistani i feel now my grandfather make the biggest mistake of his life to migrate to pakistan.
🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳✌️✌️✌️✌️
Great south Indian scientists
Most honest remarks.
I want Rajesh kutrapali in your pannel.
Well said  Mr Neil deGrasse Tyson - Ambitions  in space could be the great forces of peace, unifier forces of peace !!
So proud to be indian 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
Whole landing is a Hoax . CGI effects, not real .
In each country on the Globe, chandrayaan3 news is hitting like a breaking news happened in their own country ..!!  Never thought that ISRO efforts will bring all India together, proud & as one family... As we all have experienced, leadership plays a vital role in any country's success... BRAVO MODIJI..!
India will remain be united as long as foreign powers keep their nose out of our domestic issues and let us live peacefully.
We are a united country. Don't need any help to unite us. Chandrayaan 3 project is intrinsically valuable science and that's all it is
Proud of isro to have accomplished such a huge feat
I dont like NDT, he thinks he is funny but he's not. He's not very bright either.
Coding in India is the forefront of her youth ... n as Our PM quoted  "4 ALL HUMANITY " on the planet 🌎 ..
Comedy lies and deception. Congrats CGI and media influencers on the biggest hoax in history.
Exactly 🎉
Let me get it straight. A probe landed on the moon. The event "makes history" because the ship landed in a crater and was sent by India, and India has "diverse" culture. Then, seriously, the audience was made aware that water is made of hydrogen and oxigen, nonetheless. I miss to see what historical point was made. How complex was the probe, what experiments can make, is there anything new or innovative, or never made before? That would have been of some interest to hear. Nothing against indian space program, but I miss to see how history was made landing a probe on the moon in 2023. That history was made in the sixties already. As well sending a probe around Mars, the size and weight of a basketball, does not makes history now: too late. At best, it is a successful space mission. Media shill has become really embarassing.
I’ll be honest IDGAF about it. When we fix our problems down here, Ill care about exploring the GD moon
Isro 🇮🇳 is really creative and  most efficient 🌌 space organization in the world..
Unifying force of peace....  Most important line ..  Ex.. In ISS both US and Russia are working together
Peace would be our biggest accomplishment.
Nobody has to tell India to include everyone in its science mission. ISRO or any institute in India for that matter already has participation from every corner of the diverse India. Even when reporting this achievement, this USpeople try to lecture India based on their propaganda in ideas or ignorance. They act like diversity inclusion etc are something they invented. If you want to know, just look at the names of the hundreds of ISRO scientists and staff involved. Men, women, south, north, whatever ethnic or religious backgrounds. They are not employed after this man adviced Modi to make sure everyone s participation. 😂They have been there for years.
Congrats India... Pkease ignore the jealous westerners and focus on your (ISRO's) future missions...  No offence but I still do not believe that US ever sent a manned mission to moon.  Even in 2022 / 2023... With 50 years advanced technology ; rockets are going puff and boom...  How would anyone; even with simple common sense would believe that they sent a manned mission back then?? 🤔 😝
Chandrayaan-3 budget : $75 million   Interstellar budget : $165 million
proud of isro and india will vote foir bjp they are making real progress for the country
How many people need an operation in India to save their eyesight?
Such technical and scientific questions should have been asked by that one Indian news anchor instead she was talking about snake charmers and aliens on the moon 😢
Neil's kid like enthusiasms pure gold.
That was a good, simple explanation of why landing on the south pole of the moon is so hard.
South India is really a different world alltogether❤
Jurassic Park's C.G.I looks more realistic . Just saying ..
Ever since Neil denounced science and talked about genders, lost a lot of rspect for him.  He seems to pick and choose science.  Congrats to India though!
Someone bring me some moon water 💧 😅
India may hv human mission between 2035 to 2040
I really love Neil deGrasse Tyson,  He also seems to admire India & it's diversity.  Love ❤ to see that 😊
The sound at 2.42. 😂
JAI HIND. Proud to be an INDIAN 🇮🇳.
He just came for 3 mins?
I jumped here as soon as I saw NDT. Man's a genius.
I’m glad we got feedback from someone who hasn’t actually scientifically done anything but appear on tv shows
We have very long way to go. We will work hard and get there. We have to lift 300 million people out of poverty.
With a tight budget 76 million dollars those who are rocket science and space industry nerds know how tiny this budget is India just proved that budget doesn't matter what matter is hard work and dedication 👏
Thanks for your information about Chandrayaan 3 landing on the South pole of the mooooon 😊
Good interview, not like economic times by navika kumar
1:23 "So it's literally where the sun don't shine" 😂😂😂
Thank you all for your kind words. Much appreciated ❤🎉
Thank you so much sir for sharing chandrayan 3 news
I never watched this show before but I though I’m watching BET for a moment
When we Indians unite we create world record, have you seen isro livestream record 😂 Vande matram 🇮🇳🔥 Thanks and love from India
I proud to be indian 🇮🇳💕
Wow. ❤ greets from India to this show and that astrophysicist. ❤
🇮🇳 ❤
👍👍👍👍👍
There are more things that UNITE us than divide us. There are plenty. 🇮🇳 🇺🇸 . Jai Hind.
ive seen more real looking things on cartoons... you bunch of bots
🇮🇳 India is going to put three astronauts in space in 2025, including one female astronaut , cruising in polar orbit, for a week…along with a spacewalk ….wish us luck America 🇺🇸 👍🤟🏾👌🏾….hope we are successful ….thanks dear brothers and sisters from America, ❤ from India
"Actually there is no north and south pole it's just a figment of our imagination and perspective" neil probably
The anchor and Tyson sound a tad patronizing and preachy. Yeah, I am touchy.
Its significant because now the Pakistan only need to look for Indian flag on new moon to declare celebration of Eid Mubarak every year!!!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
As a Indian We have a long path to take on in terms of many things this is very little but a moment of achivement for Indians ❤ a long way to achieve
Indian news channel are not like this😔
🎉
Congrats to India and humanity for this great achievement. 🎉❤
Your knowledge is forignorance to prosper
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
India soon to moon with manpower
Incredible achievement
Jai hind 🇮🇳🇮🇳
It's refreshing to finally see Neil talking about the lunar cold traps and the water there.  And I was very pleased to see one of the anchors mention rocket fuel.  People have been talking about water in the lunar cold traps since India's Chandrayaan-1 found evidence of massive ice deposits there in 2010.  It is delta V, the change in velocity needed, that drives the exponent in the rocket equation. Lunar ice is a potential propellant source not at the bottom of earth's 11.2 kilometer/second gravity well. It would give a major military and commercial advantage to the power that controls this.  Former NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine was aware of this. Look for his essay "Why The Moon Matters". I was very pleased when Biden kept the lunar exploration goals set by Bridenstine. Developing the moon should be a bipartisan goal.
Congratulations to ISRO for making India the first country in the world to land on moon's South pole 🇮🇳🇮🇳❤️❤️
Good to see American media covering Important global events.👍
Cant wait to see some actual footage
Great step by India!
We need more people like Neil . He understands people of color achievements.
"Just let that marinate for a minute" new line for cutting people off in mid statement. Noted.
We love u Neil!
Hope navika watch this and learn!
It's like the TV show For All Mankind!
We're going to see an explosion of interest in exploring and eventually having a presence on the moon by a bunch of countries
Amazing work India...Keep it up..Congrats.
