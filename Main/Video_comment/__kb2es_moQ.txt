This isn’t appropriate for enteric coated or modified release medicines. Make sure you check with your doctor before doing this on your medication!
Que medico 🐝🌻🌈 jaja 😂💖🌷
Me wondering why my cinnamon rolls make me feel itchy
Him: ooh I NEED TO DO
👀😅
What is this actually kindly explain..?
Fun fact:   If you do this with just water (use a small amount) and pull the plunger all the way back with the end covered with your finger, you can generate a vacuum strong enough to cause the water to start to boil
No shade to Dr. Karan. Ask your pharmacist first. As I get older and work with so many pharmacist and pharm students I wonder why doctors are allowed to do the prescribing. We literally are putting out deadly fires on the daily with these doctors writing scripts all willy nilly 🤨
Skeet skeet skeet
And it hurts! And always remember some beds aren’t supposed to be crushed! 😊
What's the purpose of this? Why would I want to spend so much effort to liquify a pill?
I learnt so much when my mum was in hospital with sepsis about IVs, fluids, medicine etc all through tubes etc
This works for uncoated tablets
I was taught this as a vet tech😊
A lot of medicines are based on the 3ffective dose from absorption based on the whole pill reaching the stomach. This means you won't be getting the dose specified on the label and could cause harm, due to incorrect dosage long term or oesophageal damage depending on the medicine. Be careful guys
Not sure what you are trying to show here?
OK so my medication is smeared on my kitchen counter top. What next? Do I need a £5 note or something?
Maybe Big Pharm could make themselves useful and start making more liquid and chewable prescriptions. It seems like the majority of people who take prescriptions (the elderly) CAN'T SWALLOW PILLS!!! And lots of people with anxiety/PTSD disorders can't either! I would bet the amount of people who can't swallow pills surpasses those who can. It's ridiculous that the pharm industry ignores this glaring truth. I've been condescended to by pharmacists, nurses and doctors because I can't swallow pills. But I know: it's all about money. Pills are cheap and easy to make and outsource to countries whose manufacturing standards can't be regulated.
What is the purpose of this?
Dude I can swallow a fist full of pills, wtf is wrong with you pissies not able to swallow a single pill 💀
Does it have to be water? Can it be a small amount of juice instead?
vet csc hool cwould chbave
I suspect the mechanism behind this is cavitation / gas bubble collapse.
This way is also called "the Bill Cosby method "
doctor signs
That looks like one of those giant potassium pills. As a nurse this is useful information. Wish I had it every time I had to crush pills.
In some cases a patient is very ill and has difficulty swallowing
This is extremely helpful for me on a feeding tube. I use a pill crusher, but this seems so much easier.
Wish I knew this back when I worked neuro icu!
This is how i prefer to give gtube meds. Less mess more meds. Some things dont dissolve well but most do.
Who doesnt know this😂
Used to have to do this with my daughter’s meds and the syringe exploded from the pressure. Only happened once out of hundreds of times though.
What a nice cover of How to Save a Life. Careful liquifying medications though, it could do the exact opposite.
Looks like cum
Everydays a schoolday 😂
Somebody reviewed this already
There was a time in my life this would have came in handy.
This will do wonders for my dog 😅
Too addictfied for me tuhhh I ain't mimicking no crack head heroin shit. Nope 1 lil hit my ass
Now you can overdose on time release pills because some clown taught you to dissolve pills instead of swallowing them whole.
WHAT. I needed to know this. OMG I can do this for my patients!
I should call him....😭😭
Cold Water Separation for the Percocet users that just want the Good Stuff
as a nurse this doesn't work for all pills, only some:)
yo thats just nut
Medical school don't teach a lot of stuff or they teach it wrong
But why 😅
This is an adult film
Maybe be careful when doing that. Some pills are designed to dissolve slowly ao that it doesnt overload your system. Making it liquid can increase the absorption rate and make the medicine more potent than orionally intended.  By all means go ahead, i just wanted to make sure yall are aware that not taking medicine the way it was intended can have unintended effects.
Lol tik kope be watching guys
The boofing revolution
thats how we give sucralfate to dogs
And just why in the world would we want to do that?
Tell rehab places of this. They use this god awful machine that you put the pills in a bag and pound on the bag until they are crushed. That way they can put them in your feeding tube. Believe me I endured 5 months of sleepless nights as they don’t shut your doors either.  I’m glad I lived that nightmare and now home. I coded three times and didn’t get ice chips until month 4 . Rehab places stink. Hospitals did it in your room . Someone has to change this nightmare.
Veterinary medicine has been doing thos with sucralfate for YEARS!
I miss him
Probably should speak to pharmacists more…we’ve been doing this for ages.
This method works great when I have to feed pills through the G tube. Some pills dont dissolve that easily like vitamins some px meds dissolve so easily I just shake the syringe I don't plunge it like that. Im glad your sharing ways that could make life easier ❤
is that chili warding against vampires?
theres a reason they didnt teach you ....
I've seen junkies do this
My addict brain says doc number 2 put a watson 7.5 hydrocodone in there. Lol
I just chew mine up then chase it with water or juice 🤷🏾‍♂️
Of course I get this after my dog who takes medication passes away
Is that what happened to the sub?
Just shove it up your booty to bypass your liver...
I thought this was artificial insemination 😂
Looks like cum
Thank god i didnt know about this.
You can't use tap water 2
Its something they teach you in the vet field.
Fun fact methheads do this but they use blood instead of water
How to save a life in the background
Bro made cum!
This helps to jizzify anything solid
been doing this for almost 30 years. who tf didnt know this... the fucking syringe box tells you to do this for children. its amazing what you forget when you have access to all the knowledge in the world but forget how to use it.
Don’t do this stupid shit if your prescription says “do not crush “
i have no idea what ia going on here
Man, I wish I knew this back in my drug days 😂😂😂 would have saved a lot of time...guess it's time to try again! Thanks for the idea!
I have no idea if doing this with 20mg oxycodone tablets is safe or not, but fvck it, ever since bacterial meningitis brain damage cost me my ability to swallow eithout concentrating, pills have been a lot harder.  Gonna try this & tell my doc how it goes.
was that sucralfate?
Who’s the guy? I want him 😍
Can I do this with my antibiotics. I genuinely hate how they taste and I hate how they leave a nasty after taste in my mouth
My vitamin C are horse pills
Most tablet medications are in tablet form because they're not as effective in liquid form. Diluting your medications can make them ineffective, highly recommend against doing this unless your doctor says otherwise.
I’ve done this before. It hurts your finger pretty bad
With gloves of course
Might help if your pet has trouble swallowing pills. But probably ask the vet before doing it, some medications aren't good to do that with
Huh.  Worked as a vet tech for years and later in long term care.  Never seen anyone do that.  Usually we’d crush the tablets, put the powder in the syringe and then shake it.  But this would be way faster and easier.
I have done this when I’ve fostered kittens that were difficult to pill, when I had more success with turning them into a liquid. When I had a Panleukopenia bunch, it was a literal lifesaver!
Basically what happened to the submarine.
Knew about this trick, because I used to drugs IV before. I'm from Finland where we don't have much heroin, so the main opioid used by drug users is called "Subutex" or the psychoactive substance in it is called "Buprenorphine" and it's a substance used to treat heroin addiction in many countries. (Originally here too)  There's also these Suboxone films that have Subutex/Buprenorphine and a little bit of naloxone, which are usually about half the price of Subutex/pure Bupre, because of the naloxone, but people including me before use them, because they take the withdrawals away as well.  The film takes like 15-30mins to dissolve in water if you just try to put it in a little bit of water and just try to stir it, but if you put the film inside the barrel and out pressure with your finger and do like in the video and it will be dissolved in like 10-15secs:D
The only thing that I would think would really cause a problem with that is you’re not always gonna get 100% of the medication I wouldn’t think
Can't I just hide it in a piece of cheese or something?
Learned this from a Filipino nurse in Elmhurst hospital my first year as an emt.
Hopefully people dont start breaking up Extended Release meds now with this.
Last time I did this my syringe exploded
Them street zombies bout to loose their mindz😅
Heroin is one hell of a drug
Tonight on SMNN
What about the needle 💉 it would clog or if it made it through well 😢idk 😶 except this could never work unless you had one large gauge!  I would instead like to hear how to overcome the addiction to the needle or at least where to hit that is not going to show how fucked up my life is... It's been too long with to be suddenly without. I'm weak.
Remembering this for my pup and kitty!!!
We used this method when we'd give horses meds 🤷‍♀️
That's how I boof molly
Xanax icing was my first thought   I’m going to sleep bro
I can teach you how to take drugs but I’m not allowed to teach you how to eat to prevent your ailments.
Just causally has a syringe by his window 😂
Hope no one tries to use it as an IV or IM
Fish keepers use that technique to keep fish food from floating thus preventing goldfish from eating at the surface thus preventing the over inflating of the swim bladder.
This is dangerous
Often use this method in veterinary medicine
Im a nurse- if we need to give a (non enteric coated & non modified release)tablet thru NGT, we are still usin mortar & pestles to grind them... i cant wait to give this a try!
So what? another way to fake creampies
Loved the background... How to save a life 😊
Interesting...but you gotta make sure it's a pill that's suppose to be falling apart soon as it hit the stomach. Otherwise there can be consequences in case of the dosage and stuff
Cold shake
My vet taught me this for giving antibiotics to animals.
I was taught to do this to give my medications to my dog who had cancer and wouldn't take pills. Now... Ironically... I'm using it on myself. I have SEVERE gastroparesis and esophageal dysphagia.
I wish I’d seen this before having to force feed my cat tablets recently! They don’t spit out the liquid medicine but tablets are a nightmare. Although this would probably taste awful!
Lol, we do this at the vet. Dogs hate taking pills that size.
Na bro that's 🌰
One of my classmates through elementary school looked and acted like this guy. My classmate also murdered someone. Maybe we should allow ourselves to consider stereotypes to be true in order to protect ourselves
Yeah it worked but it's potentially rather wasteful can you reuse it?
Druggies have been doing that for years bruh 😂
Thats only works for immediate release tablets. Try it with an extended release or coated tablet and see what happens.
Omg this is so cool and could be very useful
Lol.  How many overdoses from this video
Imma snort percs like this, tap in for updates
U LITERALLY GAVE NOT FUCKING REAL INFORMATION ASS HOLE... UR NO FUCKING DOCTOR OR ANY SORT OF LOGICAL.... IF U WERE LOGICAL U WOULD EXPLAIN UR SELF!!!!
Im sad to say a drug addict taught me this. Its a common (and honestly cleaner) way addicts break down k4 (Dilaudid) rather than crushing it on something or in a straw.
Yeah, looks like a 40 of K. They tend to fall apart with a subtle crush with a mouth of water between the teeth. The wtr boils w  neg pressure.
OMG, why aren’t vets teaching this trick to ALL pet owners?!?!  ESPECIALLY cat owners?!
ty
Mhhhuuhhhh
Darn this looks like something I can create naturally without spending 10,000 dollars on a single pill
OK, but depending on the type of medicine, do you not do this?
That's bc meds are designed with route in mind. You change the form you change the efficacy.  This is potentially really dangerous.
I use this method to give my mom her meds through her GTube.  No waste, no residue.
My paediatric doctors did this all the time when i was a kid, (former sick kid).
This would make me feel like a dope head, nah I'm good
Yall never give the streets their credit
Medical school might not.have taught you this but science has
Are we not going to discuss the single 🌶️ solo chilling there?
What was you going to do with the pepper 🤔
Don't listen to stupid this is not done by heroin users. Any heroin that isn't tar doesn't have to be cooked. Ex heroin user.
I learned so much from this thread lol. I'm sure it tastes nasty though.
That would taste so much more nasty
This is how we used to give ace to race horses..
What about germs on your hand!!???
This will help me self administer B12 without the trapped air. Thanks
What is water 😱, like ot cant be compressed,
It is not hygianic, but sure it is smart
Nobody gonna talk about the pepper and syringe 😂
How to parachute without the paper.
What the F is that for
Learned this when I worked home care for chronically ill kiddos.
Big vitamins?
Ok but... I dont think you should inject anything thats supposed to be digested.
To whom this may concern, If you're a former drug user, I just wanna tell you I'm proud of you, my love. I know it's hard, but you're doing great. Even if it's been two days, may Allah make it easy for you all and guide you. to my human begins ( bc you are human, not the drug you use ), you'll get there. You are more resilient than you think, and you are capable of stopping. Just remember that life is worth living and you matter so protect and preserve your life, inshallah. I love you all ❤
I’ve seen this texture somewhere
Seems like it only works for the softer pill that easily breakdown into powder in the pill crusher anyways
Horse people know this lol
Most pills are supposed to be taken in the form they come in, their density is designed to be broken down by your stomach acid at a controlled rate to have the effect for the desired amount of time, dissolving them in water can be very dangerous so I’d recommend not to do this!
Fun fact technically we don’t learn this in nursing school but the nurses on the floor teach this in orientation. We don’t hate keep this tho.
Boofin😮
This seems like it’d be great for medicating my cats.  They HATE being pilled, but can handle liquid meds
I saw this on an episode of House
is that cum?
Just made a xanax frosted cake for the elderly home down the street thank you for the tips! ❤️
They call this "The Cosby Method"
Any kids that eat porous candy know this trick.
I heard a dick pill and two ccs 😂
Why
My daughter has a g button yes this works
All the times that I have spilled the medication with the water while trying to give my patient with g tubes medication I’m so sad 😭
Tried this and the syringe plunger popped off and went everywhere lol 😅
Sucrulfate
Your suppose to do that with pills.....i am telling on you both.
Aaaaahhhhhhh!
Thanks for mocrobs
This is how pathetic your generation is we found that out 30 years ago if not more fuck off stealing shit from the past making it your own sick generation you guys can't come up with anything good we already did it now your just lazy letting the machines we built run your lives for you how sick and sad
Of course. Most are quacks 😅 that cheated on their exams😆
That’s an old nursing home trick. Doctors write medications for tube fed patients without thoughts about how the hell they are going to be administered so we have to be clever.
very good tip to get the wrong concentration and thrombosis. IF you administer the medication like this (tablets are tablets for a reason) you have to give it enough time to dissolve
I needed to see this cause I cannot for the life of me swallow medicine whole 😭
Trying this with my percocet 😂
This doesn't work on most of the pills i work with unfortunately. Tried it. Less frustrating to just use the crusher.
I just did this with my meth and heroin... Im just kidding! Jesus..
So that's how I left a place and ended up with a dui; not knowing how I got where I was
That ain't medicine bro...
This really helps in hospice facilities when patients need meds and are unable to swallow pills
I do this a lot.
This would have helped play my little brother had cancer, we had the crushes pills in the pill crusher and then put them in orange soda and he would stick his finger and act like he took the medicine when really he he just wiped it on something out of sight. he wasn't able to take pills the entire 2 years he had cancer.We had a crush his pills and put them in orange soda when we weren't looking he would put his finger in it and swipe the medicine out and then wipe it on the side of the couch. Then act like he took his medicine. Miss you lil bro.
Med school??? I thought this was common sense….
He switches with a second plunger right as he sais "you plug it with your thumb."...you van see the second one is filled with white liquid.
doctor reacts? you didn’t know this basic information?
Straight into your nose 😉
How have I never learned this?!? 😮
Some pills are meant to dissolve in your stomach. I wouldn't recommend this with all pills.
Or...... Woman up and swallow
Vacuum is something else lol.
Great info
This is something junkies sometimes do
that'd be really good for older patients
Heroine users have known this for decades 😂
Legitimately, why?
I have to show this to my gf she hates pills
Fun fact: Heroin users never do this. Also doing this will cause major damage because there is "fillers" in pills that will NOT dissolve in your bloodstream. Which means it gets caked inside your veins and causes a bloodclot to eventually dislodge and clog your heart.
This is great to give my pets their meds.
Pepper, syringe and pineapple. What are things that go in your butt?
Actually they taught that in nursing atleast in 1990 lol
So glad I didn’t see this 6 years ago lmaoo
couldn't this also cause aeration?
That’s what I had to do when I had to give my pet medicine
So I've had to do this because one of my pills was horrible for me to swallow and I regret it cuz it tasted bad but I got the medication in my system
$1,000 says a nurse taught that guy this trick. Js
It's because it's just pure powder pressed ones
That's how I give my dog his medicine
I use this for giving pills to my pets (rabbits) you can't force them to eat but you can force them to drink. Just syringe in mouth and they swallow.
For my cats
Tf u doing getting it ready to go in your butt
My injection exploded one time die to the impact. It also doesn't work when the pill have a safety coat
My xanax cake decoration was awesome everyone enjoyed it! i added some food coloring to the mix and it turned out amazing!
Are they doing lines??
As long as the medicine doesn't say CR or ER your fine. Controlled or extended release
This can't? be good for time release medicine or am I wrong?
It’s called a booty bump
The lack of air pressure causes the water to boil at room temperature.
Now that is great for so many Doctors and Nurses
OMG
Creating a vacuum to break apart the dry pill is really smart
Sometimes, people will scrape the coating off of morphine tablets and crush them up and sniff them.
Looks like a potassium pill. They dissolve very quickly in water and look exactly like that. Do it with atorvastatin bet it won’t work.
Well hold on now, dint be giving the out this info we gonna have the next bill Cosby
Is THAT how y’all sign things?! It all makes sense now
So?
How to over dose!!!  Maybe we don't show this shit on you tube
Im gonna try this with grannys perkys🎉
What's the point
In what situation would one do this?
I did this when my father in laws dog was having an allergic reaction with benadryl and the vet said that if I didn't do it he would have died.
What is this and what is it for?
Growing up in the Vicodin days I learned this in middle school because they prescribed us Vicodin like candy so kids were already hooked before highschool, I was scared of needles until I became a Corpsman and I'm glad I was scared because seeing all the shells of the people I use to know I know I coulda been just like them now I'm an an MLS and every time I run a drug screen on chemistry I see a story in every result
Omg my dog takes sucralfate and this will be so helpful
FOLLOW FOR MORE, jeesus why so loud
Don’t do this with all medications! Some release over a longer period of time. Speak to your doctor or pharmacist before doing any sort of med hack.
Woah! You even wrote out a prescription for it at the end!
Quit romancing the drugs yall used to do 😅
Like others have said check with Dr. or pharmacist to make sure its safe to do this to the kind of med you're attempting to give. Some are delayed release or extended release and that could potentially be a death sentence if you do it with the wrong meds. Trust.
Please make sure your medication isn't an extended pill and some pills shouldn't be crushed. Always check with your doctor or pharmacist before crushing or diluting pills.
Definitely using this on my cat
Ironically, I did learn this in paramedic school.
My son has an NG tube, and insurance will only cover the pill form of one of his medications, so I do this twice a day every day.
Lame
Just tried this and it exploded. Covered the ceiling in half dissolved tylenol. Dont recommend.
Been doing this with my sons baby asprin through his g-tube for 4 years lol
I saw this video a while ago and it really came in handy when my cat had kidney disease. It’s now almost been a year since he passed, but thank you for showing this video, it really helped. Rest In Peace Blue 💙
Tell me you were a sales rep for Purdue Pharma without telling me you were a sales rep for Purdue Pharma...
I wonder if this will help something like Tylenol or whatever kick in faster. Or like, heartburn medicine. But for real though this is an incredible hack for giving medicine to pets--like the Capstar pills for the cats. I bet this'll be easier than trying to force a pill down their gullets.
I wonder if this would work with chili peppers 🤔
Depends on what med you are using.
Just in case you still don’t understand. Edward got your back.   Alright, so imagine you have a pill, and you want to break it apart. You use a special vacuum that collapses really hard, pushing through the pill and turning it into powder because water can't squish. Plus, the air inside the pill expands, adding to the destruction. It's like when you see those bubbles chewing up stuff in submarine propellers. Also, just sucking out the air doesn't do the trick; you need that vacuum to implode, not just exist. Most pills are made to dissolve slowly and get absorbed better, kind of like sand in a baggie. And, even though water can technically squish a tiny bit, for most things, it's like it can't squish at all. If someone ignores this, they probably shouldn't be talking about smart stuff.
I like the cayenne pepper you had there 😂. I grow my own .
Uuummmm maby not the best thing to show lol
The issue is most pills are meant to be taken that way.
Soooo, do you snore it or what? What do you even Do with the white pasty liquid? Lick it ?
Ugh, bad memories, man.
I can’t imagine a doctor being ok with this. DEFINITELY check with the pharmacist instead, because you might be losing some of the medication in the syringe.
Are we not gonna talk about the chile on the windowsill? No? Okay.
This literally would have saved my cat's life. It sucks that i'm only seeing this now.
Or. Cold shake on pills
That looks like a carafate tablet to me. I know carafate will dissolve in water almost instantly.
drycooking got me thru some shit
I can finally boof in a timely fashion!!
Im gonna do this in the club to some ladies
I did this when my cat was really sick. Figured it out all on my own too 😂
Does that work on pills that say do not crush do not dissolve or do not cut in half specially the larger ones like the 1200 mg ones I can take over counter Mucinex that size
This is how I give my 4 yo son his muscle relaxer. I used to crush it up and put it in apple sauce, pudding, yogurt, etc. But he started to not want those foods because he anticipated the medicine taste. It's been a lifesaver 😊
A nurse taught me this when i was getting my son out if the nicu she taught me alot actually....
Why?
Still looks like jizz…
This is a great way to help people who have difficulty swallowing tablets.
Many pills taste foul to prevent spiking
No comment
Med school didn't teach you that cus doctors have nurses pass 99% of meds lmao
God damn it. As a junkie who needs to quit meth asap and also stay sober, this is information that It didn't need to know. 😭
Well giving my dog medicine just became infinitely easier omg.
Cum
Damnit I know what I’ll be trying to recreate this wknd, and I don’t even need it.
Great for boofing percs
Are we gonna shoot the pill???
well yes it works but my question is why . If you ever held a pill in your mouth for too long you realize how bitter and unpleasant most medicine really is 😭
Doctors don’t administer medication
looks like a signature at the end
Heroin addicts do not do this. 😒. Modt heroin needs heat. But you could do this with meth. Just throw the shard, warer and shake.
Drug use 101
Do nobodies gonna ask why theres a chili pepper sitting next to a random syringe on a window seal
Legit how I use the caffeine
I’m so happy gay people are finally being excepted
There’s probably a lot they didn’t teach in medical school like diet
For all those people telling their job when they piss hot that they accidentally swallowed a half of their child’s   Adderall while chewing it to better allow for consumption.
Ancient news since the syringe was invented. 😂
*So soccer moms can look like heroine users, please no.* 😲
Does this not decrease the drugs effectiveness?
Until you do it to a extended release pull 🤣
It’s funny I knew that but never implemented it. My sister might though
My pharmacy tech teacher taught us this trick lol
There is a lot that medical school didn't teach you, my friend. A lot.
Cool
It does work better on some meds, than others.
That kinda looks like…
They taught us this in nursing school, pretty cool 😋
Who’s stomach is that small???
Nice to know- interesting
That has to taste absolutely awful and defeats the purpose of the coating entirely
Please do not do this with your own medications before consulting your healthcare provider
For the love of God don't do this with medication that has a time release.
Lol
Do this daily for my daughters g tube
Triggered addict button  v
When my kids were in the bottle stage anytime they were given medicines and they wouldn't take it.We just put it in their bottles they never knew
dude randomly keeps a pepper, syringe, and pineapple on his shelf
What was the liquid? And does it only work with certain types of medication? (Outside enteric coated or modified release)
Now show us how to make snortable powder from this paste
Learned this on the farm in the 90s when taking care of little calves.
Just swallow the pill ffs. Surely this is worse than swollowing pill
Jizz
Buuuut if you're giving that medication to someone else, I wouldn't trust my hand being on the tip, even after I've done hand hygiene
Did Bill Cosby know this trick??
What a beautiful way to decorate a cake.. lol j/k
We used to do diladas like this. Those who know know.
Im sure im just tired but i dont think I heard that right lol
I've seen meth users melt their rock like that then plunge 😂
Junkie trick. Used to call it a cold shake.
Boof now it’s gone 😂😂😂
I should call her
Doctor why do you have a chili pepper next to a syringe next to a window?
Drug addicts have done this for ever. At least I've done it for 17 years
There is a reason they don't teach this in med school or school at all... First off, nurses pass most medications  Biggest pill I have passed is potassium and by far the hardest to swallow. You are only allowed to break it in half. This is to prevent rapid absorption which is not a good thing
Ill be sure to do this with my ADHD meds tomorrow.
Definitely a neat trick i did NOT know but should have for certain hospice cases I’ve worked
Vet tech skills
Thanks,!  I need this for my HUGE potassium 💊.  I hate taking them, but I have bad muscle spasms if I don't. #MALABSORTIONDEFICIENCY#
Med school didn't teach him that but the streets could have 😐
Edward heres been a vampire for 200 years.  That's how he acquired so much knowledge
Physics is fun!
My vet tech taught me this trick, saved my life!
I legit thought it was sperm and a DIY self fertilization
My vet told me about this trick!
Fun fact im a drug addict and i do this every day
🌶️
Cool!  Last three years also shows medical schools stopped teaching critical thinking. If your a physician that still think Covid vaccine was both safe and effective for EVERYONE your a ding dong. Time to stop making you tube videos and get back to truly managing our patients health. Do no harm. Stop being tools of a corrupt system.
I work at a dog boarding facility and we have to do this sometimes for stubborn dogs who find and remove solid pills. Or if we have old dogs who struggle with solid medicine
@hunterstivers, thank you for that heroin information. I would never have known since I have never used drugs. Everyday I am learning something new on the internet 😊😊😊
Or just swallow it?
They didn’t teach you this because a good chunk of big medications say on the bottle do not crack open or spilt. Idk why Buh yeah
This is how my cousin would crush pills in the bathroom so we wouldnt notice
Quit spilling secrets
This method helped me when my grandmother was on her deathbed
More what what the fuck is going on
That looks like potassium, It typically dissolves in water anyway.
Been doing this for years to take medication via j-tube - most doctors don’t know which medication can be given via this route but pharmacists do know but you have to ask and sometimes it means waiting for them to research but worth the time
i have a bottle of caffeine tablets. I wonder if i could use this to make homemade energy drinks
Cum medicine?
I'm doing no good with this info thx tho 😈😈😈
how to abuse medication 101
Everyone like oh wow nice neet yk but the you got these mfs over here like 👀 drugs
What's the point of this video?
Oh man i ysed to do that all the time bot with pills in it just the water
About to make the best Toaster Ztrudels of the decade
what is the purpose of this video please?
This would be a good method for giving Sulcrafate to animals. We advise pet owners telling them to medicate their pets by adding pill and water to syringe and shaking, but it never dissolves completely. I’m gonna teach this to my coworkers at the Veterinary practice I work at!!
That’s gonna taste like shit. What are you supposed to do squirted in your mouth?
That is useful for pets!
I wish id known this for my dogs tablets. Wouldve made feeding his meds easier.
Dude acting like it's some big break through? Nurses have been doing this stuff forever.
So this is what Brazzers uses !!
Yup I use to do that with my pills to inject them and my heroin also when I had no 🔥. Addiction sucks but crazy that i learned this through addiction
Nursing school DID teach me this.
Youre not allowed to touch the top im a medical field.. atleast in germany
There's alot of lil tricks Nurses have that Doctors just don't know.
This will help so many people.
I had to do this for my cats. Lol its such a good idea instead of shoving a pill down their mouths and getting bitten. My vet taught it to me.
CATS! ITs MEDCINE TIME!
Its dumb some medicin should come in the stomach without getting solluted
A lot of medication state DO NOT CRUSH. this means liquify too. Check your prescription bottles and supplement papers that comes with it before doing this.
This would have been cool for my son who has EoE, he could never swallow pills growing up without choking, and so many medicines do not come in liquid form
Nice but my patients have like 18 pills in the mornings 😂
Cavitation is not to be trifled with. Same force that blows the bottom of a bottle out when you smack the top also will shred the drive screws of large ships if they're not properly maintained/tuned.
Diddys trick
Cum syringe
Doesn’t always work
it just leads to the dose into an instant release, if its addictive it will just lead to abuse, when you do that with any controlled meds it just leads to a bigger attachment, i have took that much medications, ive been on sleeping meds for 8 years, synthetic opiods for 12 years and vallium everyone has ruined my life.... all because i had to treat depression and anxiety that in the long run meds made it this way. my doctor earns money evertime they  print scripts off and the big pharma is making a living from my pain.... i make music that tells the deepest control from the meds. ile never give up, jacko - addiction , i get muted because i am talking truth. keep fighting to live....
The song is how to save a life. If anyone wondering. It's a good song I love it.
This is gonna kill people
We did that with my cats tranquilizers 😂 he wouldn’t take the pill so that’s what we had to do
I work with puppies who hate taking pills. Thank you
Dam imagine a narco like tho lmaoooo
Need a slow mo bros video on this
Time release meds can kill u this way 😘
This would definitely work with fentanyl
So they made a cum gun?
This would be good for animal medication
Is he making supplement or medication icing? Where exactly are we supposed to put that?😳
So what, you can drink your pills or boof it?
As a current heroin addict thank you
We do that to pill to horses in vet med
That shit hurts 😂
I'm not a technical Doctor... Yet I feel confident in saying there's a lot more than that they don't teach you in medical school.  This is great when new ways are being communicated.
I've let a pill sit in my mouth and it was the most revolting thing ever to have in a mouth.
Perk paste
I have to admister medication through a G-Tube to one of my patients daily and this just changed my life!
I had to do this with my Dads Meds to put them in his feeding tube because he has Esophageal Cancer.. 💔😞😭 But I will say I was thankful when I see the ORIGINAL Video because it made it so much easier and better than crushing them and trying to suck them up out of a little medicine cup. ❤️
He wrote an RX for Sertraline at the end
I tried this with Carafate to give a dog at work. Maybe I was too aggressive with it, but it stung lol.
Lay off the dope
Thats a docs signature for sure
Jizz art
Fun fact I can’t reply to the “H” with no spoon comment and I spent waaaaay too long trying to attempt to lol 😂
Are we not going to talk about the chili pepper??
How to contaminate sterile equipment*
This did wonders for my dating life
It can hurt like mfer though. Did this ina  small syringe for my pet rats and it felt like being stabbed
Thats how doctors sign there names 😂lol
Also, make sure to use freshly washed/ sanitized hands or even 1 time use gloved thumb to do this! You don’t want to introduce finger bacteria from everywhere you touched that day :-) just a friendly reminder! (I’m guessing it’s obvious to state, but you’d be surprised the unsanitary things I’ve seen in healthcare.)
Whitey know they way around some drugs😂
I do this often because i take most medication through a feeding tube
I know about this because I was a needle junkie for 12 years and there’s something called a cold shake, usually done with Suboxone strips,  you take your diabetic syringes and put a piece of the strip inside the syringe, put the plunger back in and draw up some water, shake until the strip dissolves. Can’t do it with pills, though
Helpful...... I Guess? I'm sure "Some" folks will dig it... 👌
Not always
We were taught this in nursing 😂
There are various reasons why pills are in pill format, if you really need a liquid then you can ask
I do this with my oxycodone I get from that guy down the street
my penis does that too
Backloading the rig
It also hurts like hell
Ooo vet medicine pro hack 💉
Why is there a random Cayenne pepper on the counter? 🥵💀
So can I booty bump that shit or what?
...make it work with a damn keppra tablet 😅  then ill subscribe.
Yo skip these comments. People be giving waayyyy TMI in here. Skip to the next comment section unless you want to hear about kids deaths, spiking foods, and heroine users
Probably not good for extended release
Niw we can all bunghole fentanyl thanks Dr dipshitdumdum
Medical school didn’t teach you this?!
That dry chilli gave me a fright - I thought you were going to dissolve that to make chilli liquid
This is a great idea for giving my dog her medicine. ❤
Fellow Tubies. Do not get your hopes up. 🫥. Very few tablets will work. ANY coated pill obviously will take more work. But even when crushed this lovely dissolved outcome so quickly is a stretch.  Tips. Use warm water. Helps prep but it also helps when giving meds via tube. Particularly if you (or your patient) are sensitive.   This "hack" isn't bullocks. And probably works for some meds. But as someone who deals with tubes/meds regularly, do t get your hopes to high. ❤❤
Do this for NG tube meds all the time.
You can't just use "the scrubs song".
A nuerantin pill
Jeffrey Dahmer• Adolf Hitler• Colleen Ballinger• Donald Trump:  Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony...
In what scenario is this usually used?
Nurses know this trick because we actually give medication unlike doctors!
Why the fuck does a doctor need to do this they don’t administer shit ..
Why is there a pepper in the window?
Follow for more “make your own fake jizz” videos.
Some grilled pineapple with a nice chili-honey-thyme glaze … oohhhh
That perk finna kick in quick
Why would you do this? Medicine capsules are designed to dissolve at at a specific time in your body. The pills have that dissolving time built into the exact way they are made, you shouldnt mess with it
This is great. My daughter can't swallow pills, or is to afraid to try. If i give her Tylenol or a vitamin i have to put it in a cup of water 😂.
Wait, he turns dick pill straight into cum? Interddasting.
This is also very dangerous due to the pill not slowly being absorbed... Instead you're getting the full dose immediately. With some medication this could seriously hurt someone
Some are meant to be slow release, this is for people who have a hard time swallowing pills
Dysphagia here I come
Who else thought this was gonna be instructions for  how to Boof?
I was afraid this was going inside an IV cannula
Then you hoop it!
This how meth fiends do shots without a filter/spoon, I’ve done it once. Feels dirty af. I know heroin can be done this way too, but I never tried that when I was addicted as heroin is hella dirty.
Looks like jizz
Boofing adderall just got a whole lot easier
Me question is why would you do this just take the pill
Any vet tech knows this trick for sucralfate
Ok so...what pills are good for this?
I’ll try this once when giving peg meds
Is this like a better way to take a pill or to cock my window seal?
What he didn’t say was this will taste like absolute 💩 that’s why they compress and coat those things but whatever tickles your pickle or helps you get it in or down 🥴
Nurses have been doing this for decades 😂
that norco finna hit fast
Hey I used to do the same thing with mdma..!😃
Can I use it for meth?
I like how he wrote the prescription at the end
Whoppers. I eat whoppers candies by biting a small hole in the chocolate coating, then sucking on it.  Then I let my saliva go back into the vacuum o created, then I can chew the chocolate without crunchiness.
Old vet tech trick!
If anyone is curious. This works because water is incompressible, so the force of the collapsing vacuum is directed through the pill causing it to powderize
Why would you ever need to do this lol
What’s the use for that ?
And then what swallow it
What the hell is that
I paid 50 dollars to have my dogs medicine compounded and I could have just done this
Forbidden milk
People are going to use this to make perc cakes with “icing” thanks Joe Brandon
Is this for dogs? Or animal's
The vacuum and pressure releases can be quite violent despite the innocent look. Do not recommend if you are working with volatile or live matter.
Every junkie knows this lol
Would've been helpful to know with a g tube, but no use for my CVC Line now though unfortunately 😕 The more you know i guess!
And then you just blast that up your prison purse 😂
Just made my drug consumption much more convenient fam thanks
tried this with my cats meds and the syringe exploded, big oof.
well pills are supposed to dissolve 🧍🏽‍♂️
I can't swallow pills , this is great to know!
When I was addicted to opiates, I would do this because it felt like it made the morphines and oxy's hit sooner and harder than just eating the pill
But why tho
Just say NO to all otc and toxic big pHARMa drugs..
Thanks.. Rn
It’s supposed to do that in your stomach now it’s gonna taste really bad
Why
Will this work if you want to reduce the medication you were unnecessarily put on. Or with 1ml maybe have more of the medication in it than another ml (if you understand me?) PLEASE HELP! 🤲🏻☝🏻
Works the same with pickling things. In a commercial kitchen, you put whatever you want to be pickled in with the pickling liquid in a vaccum machine and seal it in a bag with all the air taken out. What takes weeks in a jar now takes hours instead.
Next time my dog needs medicine
You know you learned that from a nurse….you should give credit!!! …..we’ve been using this method to get medicine down a feeding tube for years and years. Boy bye you didn’t figure this out on your own
That's how they make fake c*m too!
We poor dnt knw doctors bye lie
U liquid the pill 🤔
I learned this through playing with syringes and drug abuse.😢
Pills go in needles it works better. If the pill isnt water soluble you can add vinegar to break them down, might smell like a salad after shooting up the vinegar.
You made semen, I can do that too but my is plastic free...
Sadly doesn't work with my sulphasalazine, it has an enteric coating on it 😢
Just took a core sample of your thumb
So cool what the world can make outta the little things
Yea I have to do this for my daughter with Tylenol because she won't take pills but the children's is too weak for her. I actually showed some of her nurses at the hospital this, and they loved it. I've gotten a couple useful tips from TikTok and such that help my daughter with her medical stuff.
Do it with the pepper
.. nursing school would have taught you this..
I did that - medicating cars and dogs. I go further.. I then mix with nutrical/honey.. animals love ‘medicine time.’ FREE GAME (pet owners)
What was a pepper doing there
I use this method for my autistic daughter, who can't swallow pills. Be sure to have water or juice nearby for after.
Is that a 7.5mg Hydrocodone?🤤
This makes suppositories a lot easier to take. 😅😂
Great new way to take pain meds
A meth head at work told me this is what your supposed to do and then he laid on his back with his legs up and demonstrated shooting it into his asshole… also my brother and my friend knew what I was talking about when I brought it up they were both meth heads
Don't show puff or bill that
Cream
It works well with delada. Its called cold shaking!
Junkies are gonna love this. Fuck, they probably already know about it. Fuck, they probably invented it LMFAO
Wish I knew this growing up. I could never swallow pills even into adulthood.
We used this trick with our cats and dog medicine a lot. They stopped swallowing pills, even when hidden, so it was the easiest way. Just had to keep their jaws open long enough 😅
Yess! I’m a go get some pec 30s and try it! Wish me luck 😂
Daaaaaaam!
I need this info. I will get a syringe on standby.
There going to be a lot of people trying this to butt-chug some pills after watching this.
Looks like jizz
I'm a med technician that works with dementia and Alzheimer's patients and some of them can't swallow correctly this is a method that we are always trained in besides using pudding or applesauce
Now i know and i dont have student loans 😂
Common sense is so rare nowadays. Are you guys 15 years old making stupid videos like this??
Come to vet med. We got all kindsa tricks like that 😊
Be careful when doing this.Make sure that the pills are not extended-release And are not made to dissolve at a specific rate so you do not overdose
This is how I used to give animals medicine at the hospital
volumetric dosing
Cavitation is a powerful force.
As a nurse I feel like only some medications will do this. Some meds dissolve in water instantly (ex: Klonopin) but other things (ex: melatonin) will stay a little grainy. I’ve seen this hack and tried it at work to break up undiscovered meds in the G-Tube 60 ml syringe and it did nothing but hurt my hand 😅 maybe for pets this might be easier than sneaking into food but for a med pass with multiple pills needing to be crushed, it doesn’t work from what I’ve tried
Man this really would've helped when I was banging oxys back in the day. Miss it but don't miss it, you won't understand unless youre an addict
i do this when i want to feed my birds medicine
Why not just use a pill crusher?
Someone explain
how to make cum
I’m gonna get so high
Cum
We used to do this for steroids when my daughter was going through her chemo therapy. Works like a charm. My wife figured it out and showed the doctor who started recommending it to all the parents there. Pretty cool
Everything reminds me of him
N thats why we have nurses😂
Crazy
Now they have time release (cover or something so u cant sniff pills. )
Surely people with bad intentions won’t abuse this method for nefarious reasons
Would have been helpful when caring for mom on hospice
Probably taste like garbage
That’s some cum
Funny enough, I learned this in boyscouts, mechanical engineering, and chemistry, but not in emergency rescue, medical aid, or home economics
Now people can boof their pills efficiently 😂
yah but now i can taste it and the slow 12 hour effect is now a insta 5 hour high that leaves you feeling sick.. there's a reason why it's in a pill form :P
Signed name in opioids
So much for time release 😂😂 about to throw your liver a party
Many pills are designed to dissolve at a certain rate, or have different facets. I wouldn't recommend this for all of em.
Laugh out loud, the teacher in medical school, but learned it in internship fake news
Dry cookin that pill 😅😅😅😅😅😅
Fake
Cavitation baby
Ayo what was in that. AYO WHAT WAS IN THAT!!!!!
Doesn't every pet owner know this trick?
Wish i would of known this during the oxy 80mg days
Cum
It does work, very useful for people who struggle to swallow pills and feeding tubes
Yeah a nurse probably did....lol
Your local subutex addict wants royalties
Being a drug addict for years taught me this... sober 7 years now
Too bad I can't do this with my kids allergy medication LOL
Old nurses in Australia used to do this before the magic liquid children's medicine or if they only had pill form..
Looks like your girlfriend's cream filling
Lmfao non ranchers barely learing. 10 yesrs of school lol
It‘s all fun and games until the syringe explodes into your face. - speaking from experience
Sick tag bro
Pet owners now have a new tactic
And ?    You csn also use a pen.   Or if you want a mess anything thats a liquid.   Chocolate  ect.    Whats the purpose 🤔,?
Learned this as a pill junkie...
🤔 great idea for Plan Bs
Don’t do this all the time, certain pills are designed to dissolve more slowly on purpose.
Use your thumb to transfer bacteria right to the patient's mouth.
Omggggg bet
What?
Won't work all of the time
Oxy bath
It's mad annoying to wait for it to dry up before you can snort it again though
Doin this wit my xans
if u do this and apply that with needle then,u will die cause that air bubble
Fun fact they learned this observing a heroine addict 😂😅
So that’s what my GF has been putting on her face before I get home from work!  And here I was suspecting she was two timing me. I’m so happy to know she’s just really into chemical application.
Now your ready for boofin
This trick saved me when I had to give my dog meds after dental surgery ❤
This is definitely not “how to save a life”
Just turned 4 perks to paste and snorted it.
This does not pass Lippincott standards. There are a lot of things I've seen at work but rarely is it an approved method.
Dont let carti see this
Cum
Definitely going to try this!!!
I so wish I had known this when my son was little. He couldn’t swallow pills until he was like 18.
His pupils are huge . 😮😮😂😂
I know you do this in good spirit but 100s off ppl are curious about injecting drugs this way now! Thanks for more overdoses!😂😂😂😂
I've been doing this for years to put medicine through my son's gtube. DISCLAIMER: the pressure and repeated blows to the top break the syringe after about 7 times of breaking the pill in my experience.
The fact I've known this and veen utilizing it for 30+ years already tells me I have dealt with far too much medical issues vetween me and my family and starting at such a young age.   In a country where we treat symptoms opposed to focusing on curing disorders, it doesn't bode well for any of us.
Follow for more what? Stolen content? Lmao 🤡
That’s nuts
Doc knew what he was doing with that music
Dreamy bull would love this trick😅
but not all meds should be crushed or desolved make sure with your Pharmacist first
Why though??
So many people say they didn't learn this in medical school, but I learned this from my grandmother growing up in the hood. This is how she would get us to take our vitamins.
Drug addicts taking notes 📜😂
Don't do that for medicine.
What about time released stuff. This guys really not that smart. Can’t say that word or I’ll get a warning from YouTube Nazis!

There's a reason medical school didn't teach you this.
Instructions unclear, I got sucked thumb-first into the syringe.
Doctors learning physics is a tv show is really like to watch
The pill rubbed one put aye😮😢😂😂😂
Slow releasing OxyContin 30mg wrecked the 2000s and made federally regulated pill farms rich 🧠 even though they knew through through research that OxyContin has a very high addiction rate

Isn't it woul change pharmacokinetics of the drug?
The video:🧐 The music:😢
You just gave people new ways to do perks 😂
Medical school wont teach you that... But some junkies however... Probably know more about flobotimy, drugs and needles more than nurses..
When he squirted the syringe he actually wrote a script for "mofine. 1 pound. To go."
Man invented cum without cum
BILL COSBY APPROVES
That’s how men get pregnant 🫄
I'm a g- tube parent I have been doing this since day one❤ with all his pills....I'm baffled by how Drs don't think to do this😂 y'all can save lives but this?!? Silly 😂😅
Is there a particular reason you’re showing us how to inject pills on the go?
Oh cool so now i can just take my fish oil like eye drops

This was definitely thought of by a herion or opiate addict.
lol medical school didn’t teach me this but lady heroin taught me this one awhile back. its cute someone is making a video about it like its a fucking life hack haha
Imma do this with da percs
All these kids suck 😂😂😂
Only works if you let the pill sit in there for a few mins.
Boyz we getting litty tonight 🎉
Is Bill Cosby still alive? 🤷🏻‍♂️ Idk why I thought about him, but I was just asking. 🤔
This would be a fun way to take my adderall
This just made me wanna relapse
He def puts that in his ass
Parents, don't do this to your kids, it will overdose them
Antibiotics or meds that work by being in high concentrations will be fine, but allmother meds are designed to have bioavailability that works better for the symptoms, more complex than make it seem.
Some.meds have to be swallowed whole. Acetaminophen is toxic to your liver, if you take it like this your are getting 3hrs worth all.at once, dumb
Overdose!
Aren’t some pills meant to dissolve slowly in your system
Fake video
It kind of looks like something
Ive been doing this for almost a decade now with my heroin. But i heat the syringe just enough ao it qont melt with a lighter to cook the atuff in there
This is absolutely real. I learned this by giving puppies their medicine at a puppy store. Lol
PERC CUPCAKW
Okay... but why's it white 💀
Why is this the background music.
Now your ready for boofing
Ummmmmmmmmmmm 😂
This also works well for pills for animals that don’t like taking them It causes less anxiety and pain on their behalf
An unfortunate issue with this is occasionally the syringe will explode😅😅😅 Ask me how i know that 🤣🤣
Wish I did this w my sons thyroid med😭 crushing it up and mixing it in the water was a pain
Oh hey water hammer crushed pills!
I learned this when having to give pills to horses
Didn't know this lol cold shots it is hahah
Bet imma boof this Adderall now
Someone has used heroin
Did he say d*** pill or big pill
We not gonna talk about how badly it hurts your thumb lol
Edward Cullen?
yum! xanax frosting!!
Ok but why tho
I’d say 95% of what you learn, in the field, through experience- is what you remember and carry with you.  School is just the secret transport to the playground.  It’s “gets you there.”  Like a Toddler, confused and scared, faking 50% of your professionalism.  😂Terrified you’ll need something that day that school didn’t ready you for.
Dude used a hydro😂
I take my pills like an adult,with alcohol. 😂
Thought he said you take a Dick pill 😂
Or you just swallow pills like an adult. Wrap it in sausage or cheeese....
Vacuum pulls all the air out. It goes up cause it's in water, and the vacuum is removed. Air is replaced with water
Don’t do this. Not all pills work the same once the coating is destroyed
Science
Boutta make some perc frosting
Just tried it. 100 percent it works
Why?
This is dry cooking.  You lower boiling point when atmosphere is vacuum
We did this with my son’s medication and it broke the syringe and shot out at us. Never again!
Dilaudid❤
I don’t recommend this unless you’re trying to clog your heart at 22
So I'm not the only one that always has a red pepper , a syringe and a pineapple ready to go on the windowsill? So cool!
Things known by nurses... and druggies.
Addicts have known this for decades
cum
Meth plants
What did he put in the syringe?
Can I do this w my adderall?
Be wary if your pills are time release, this will destroy that feature causing you to overdose
imagine the bar creep making roofie cupcakes after seeing this video
Then boof.
Ew
Hope it wasn't time release.
Nice way to clog up the needle
The song is from scurbs ❤
😍😍😍looks like daddy's jizz
Welp, that would have been useful information for that year and a half I was crushing pills to put in my dads feeding tube before he passed.
Oh wow I can make that too no syringe needed
There’s a reason some medicine is made into pills to be swallowed, so don’t do this.
Learned the vacuum trick as a kid😂😂
They didnt teach you that it hurts the hell out of your finger too
It's probably not sanitary
Why is your stupid face necessary?
Very nice for us meth users
this man should be stripped of a medical license
Worst taste EVER
Me vet taught me this one
It does not work with the coated ones. Wich most of the gigantic pills are.
I wish I knew this in highschool😂
This world is fucked. God bless & goodmorning.   Thats right. I know you inbreds are watching this at 5:13 am.
I use to abuse morphine this way was easier liquifying the pill to extract the mixed liquid with cotton and bang in the vein
medical school 0 the street 1😂
Bro got 1 million Likes for playing someone else's video 😵
There’s no one going to mention the pepper
The negative pressure is real high from the vaccum of the syring.
I was gonna say I used to do this for my heroin and crack/lemon juice.
Bro teaching people to inject pills 😢 fuck you and your lack of morals
This is how i give my dogs their meds😂
Why would you show people this shit you are so stupid
Man I love Dr Karan.    Such a humble human being .
All drug addicts know this.
I have no clue what I’m watching
i only know about this because i used to hang out w addicts 😭
As an ex heroin addict i can confirm it works.😂
Boofin meth or blow 🎉😂
This would've come in handy... For something I was doing.
Follow to learn how to junk 😅
Bro made glue
Awesome video man loved your summaries short n sweet n to the point luv to see a pt 2.
Yea just make sure it doesnt have alot of filler in it, i used to do this with h and there's all kinds of nasty stuff in it
Omg can’t I do this with my adderall I hate swallowing the pills they get stuck on the back of my tung
😏
A former addict like me 😏
I tried doing it. It freaking exploded 😑
I do this often. And I love the song.
I should call her…
wish i knew this back when plugging X / M30's🤣
This is a great tip. I struggled my whole life because of a narrow esophagus an I choke on pills all the time especially big antibiotics.
Its mainly because it makes a vacuum, bur also breaks it by mechanical action after to mix.
Ah so y'all just teaching how to do drugs now?
Junkies been doing this years 😂  nothing new
Is this where babies come from?
The person in the kitchen making my food
Please don't do this in a healthcare setting. Please always follow a doctors prescription or Right Passage.
Smart not letting people remix it😂
We fin have nga eating perk frosted birthday cake 😂😂
Doesn't this take the fun out of suppositories though?
Not sure if this would effect medicine but when liquid is under a vacume inside the syringe it boils at room temp from the pressure
All the boofers are rejoicing 😂😂😂
I used to crush pills between two spoons and then swallow the powder.  This would of been a game changer.
You’re increasing the temperature but pressuring it
Gonna learn pancake art then make my gf a laxative Mickey Mouse shaped one thanks to this. Thanks OP!
POV: how to boof
Couldnt the backwards pressure force the concotion through your epidermus potentially dosing yourself?
I dont need a string and some pill to create this liquid  Check this out 🗿
Cum
Tried it in the job, this is part of my daily routine now!
This works really well actually did a lot on the farm
One little hit *does multiple
R&D always has the best ideas
Cavitation is a hell of s thing! It can cause pitting in the strongest steals, i think itll break up a little pill!
The signature at the end was impressive.
No you steal content
What’s the point, just crush and snort!
Why did this pop up right after I used a syringe to fill a cart…
They taught me this in chemistry.
We out here taking our medicine, not as directed
I can do that with my cucumber
I used that technique for getting air bubbles out of a leaf epidermis sample in high school
😮
FYI that was the doc giving his signature at the end. lol
Welp ... they'll be boofin hydros now...
Yeah it’s cavitation. Microscopic bubbles that form under the vacuum and burst faster than the speed of sound. Breaks up the pill
Gonna use your drawing to get a prescription
"Spice up your toster strudel with this easy trick!"
Why is it in a needless is syringe like that? Oh wait, is it going to be shoved into 🍑💉??? Omgggg 😳
Percocet users about to put that ish on everything like hot sauce
They don't teach it cause it's unsanitary practice. Never do this pls
Gabipentin
See this is surprising to me because I literally just got medicine for my dog that you have to do this for but even before that I knew this
Does it work with percocet?
Learned this when I was doing the hospice for my grandfather. It really helped getting the meds down because he couldn’t swallow well towards the end.
Jizz
I that the special cream?
Netflix: “Are you still watching?”
Didn't Vsauce do a video on this?
Cum
I believe that when the pill is just compressed powder, this works like a mini vacuum chamber and helps the fluid rapidly fill all the gaps between the powder.
He did his Dr signature that no one ever can read.
Mmmmm zanny iced cupcake
I tried it out before. First: this hurts pretty bad on your thumb actually and Second: the water turned pink from the pill, but the pill didn't even break. What did I do wrong?
I saw that chili pepper
I appreciate the tagging with medicine
I didn’t go to school or anything but I thought all pills has there own time to dissolve in your stomach so you don’t get sick from it or so you don’t get all the medicine in your system all at ones but like I said I don’t know I didn’t go to school for it
Money shot
Nah that second guy crushed the pill off camera cause how was it already in pieces when he went to put water in it?! Cap
The reason they don’t teach you this is because all pills are designed differently to be released at specific times in the body, or have a releasing speed, etc. by doing this you may be changing the effectiveness of the pill or how it works in the body
Wife's done this for ages
Addicts do this. Dont ask me how i know.
Addicts do this alot. Dont ask me how i knoe.
Yessirrr, I’m finna make a perkio  strudel
I used to watch addicts do that same trick with dilaudid when I was a child in a bad situation. Way to "shake up" some memories 😂
How to save a life hits in the background
He thought we wouldn't realize he switched it out for his nut.
Been doing this for 15 years.... helps for animals and kids
Imma give my lady the “pill” later
It's called a slurry and I'm not even a Doctor.
It’s like when you put a dry ass cracker in your mouth and suck it against the roof of your mouth and it just dissolves.
I was actually taught this in chemistry a few weeks ago! The reason this works is because of the extreme change in pressure. When you pull the plunger back enough with water in it, the water boils because of the increase in air pressure, then with the decrease of air pressure, and increase of water pressure when you let go of the plunger, crushes whatever is in the syringe.
my adderal will now be hitting this brain in turbo mode
I learnt this working on a dariy farm pretty surprising its not taught in medical school its basically standard practice for giving a calf or cow a pill
I used to do this to my crayfish's fish food/turtle food to get it to sink in his tank.
Thought it had to dissolve in your stomach for it to work properly
This is also useful for boofing stimulants or MDMA
Medical Doctors don't know how to dry cook their shit?  No wonder they're not very good at physics.
It's all about physics
I'm not sure it's safe to boil medication
I didn't know that's how semen was made.
Passed out 17 times but here’s your medicine 😭
just fucking chew it at this point
I should call her
Lace ur buddy with a viagra in his drink and act like he’s gay all night
Never do this with doxycycline, my wife developed esophagitis from it
Only thing this is useful for is dogs I would assume & cats lol
Btw. Doc. This is how you put drugs up your buttt recreationally aka boofing
don’t do this…
Even I knew this
I usually just snort them
Should I inject this?
Yeah, but if it's a slow release capsule, you're gonna kill yourself? Some of them are extended delay release for a purpose
Going to boot that ish
I’m finna make some xanny cinnamon rolls now
KR Tag looking 🔥 🔥🔥🗣🗣
He wrote "ibuprofen" at the end
Now i can frost my toaster strudels in style 😎
Did you just write your autograph at the end😂🎉
I used to do that with Percs!
That moment its probably a trick addicts use
Opioid addicts are going to love this trick
Now I can drink my suppositories, sweet. I hate going wrist deep and losing it before it makes contact with the leather cheerio.
Finna make a perc 30 emulsion
Insta release your xr pills folks😂
Will be using this trick on the tiny man in the haus
The environment has to be harsh enough to reward ability for planning and cooperation through human evolution, but easy enough that some weirdos could afford to trade, experiment and innovate.  Just look at any country, - the worse the weather the better are people somehow. Its because the harsh weather just did not let the stup1d ones to survive. But no, evolution is racists you see, lets make some elaborate lies to make ourselves feel better
Easy dog medicine for now on.
🌶️
Me putting “frosting” on cookies for my birthday (my friends won’t be able to leave their toilets for the next 5 years)
Works with suppositories, too.
Some teenager somewhere is doing this with his 20mg xr adderal
As a EMT i find this extremely useful

Why even bother with that? Like a pill is supposed to be swallowed so this could only be for people who dont want to swallow big pills to which i can only say: pls grow up Karens and Kens
In what situation would I need to turn a pill into liquid?
So, if i do that in reverse... I can turn my cum into a pil?
Maybe he should add that there are many medications where you should never do this - like heart medications, anything slow release etc. it works but can kill people if you don’t know what you are doing.
I can finally stop snorting my long release OxyContin
Me turning my extended release Adderall into instant release
I love the science behind why this works. Putting by plugging the hole and making air tight no air can get in or out, so when you pull back the syringe, the pressure increases and as a result the boiling point of the water drops allowing it to boil rapidly!
AND WHERE DID I GO WRONG, I LOST A FRIEND
this is how i give my pets their medicine
😂 why show everyone this now people know how to roofie someone
I wonder if the water boiling helps it dissolve better even though minimal heat is added
This is literally a drug addict hack.
Am I the only one who tried this and it felt like the water was gonna pierce my thumb? 😅
As someone with a cocaine problem... I absolutely didn't need to see this...  (don't worry, I'm working through it)
Yeah bc that some nurse secret tech it wasnt meant for MDs!
Is that Vicodin?
I can never find the pill crusher on my unit, 100% trying this out
Mmm yummy Xanax syrup for my homemade opiate ice capps
Bout to make some art with my anti-depressants
Hey, that kinds looked like ‐
Does not work with every pill but yeah
This is how I give my dogs medications.
Used to do this to boof, iykyk
This is only for regular compressed tablets. Not costed ones. Yeah, they have no structure when wet
This would taste like shit.
I learned this after my dog had surgery and wouldnt take her pills.
The Fray in the background ❤️
Learned this un second year of lic. nurse
Pressure level changes = boils
EXPLANATION. When you pull the plumger it creates a vacuum. And water can dissolve more things in vacuum. The solubility of the water is increased by creating A vacuum
Bro i literally put syringes on my thumb when i was younger, i didnt know people actually used it medically
Atmospheric Pressure
Yep just be really careful. Some pills might do damage to your teeth
Water hammer!
🔥🔥NEW BOOFING TACTIC🔥🔥
I’ve been doing a six years
I used to do this when I was a kid. What that means?
Bro jizzed a signature (im sorry)
This is literally simple chemistry
It looks like
Low pressure makes the water boil, at least very close to it.
Nah that apply to only few medications i tried with all similar medications and it didn't desolve well  The one you used alread started breaking down before you do the vacuum thing.
I passed out 5 times but heres ur medicine
That is how to save a life..
The water starts to boil but since it cant leave anything in it starts to dissolve. Bc the water is so little in quantity the temperatures are not dangerous. It boils bc of the decrease in pressure. A vaccume is created and the water milecules are ripped out in order to fill that vaccum.
Pre cu-
😂my fellow nurses, don’t do it, just use the pill crusher, it is not very effective and people give you side eyes for making weird noises
ayo whats that white liquid
okay, but why
Turns out I'm not the only one that has a random dried chili pepper on my windowsill

Aw man, who jizzed on my counter
Can medicine be injected into the bloodstream? The purpose confuses me
We used to do this in the care home I worked in when we had tablets that we were told we could give dissolve. It really makes things easier to administer
Now what?
I used to do this when I has an NG tube and was too lazy to break them lol
Wish I'd known how to do this when my damn doctors told me to use a mortar and pestle
Yuk
This is my kingdom come
Is this something I could do for my child who has trouble swallowing anything but liquids? Right now he's 5 and his meds are all liquids still. But eventually he'll be old enough that meds will come in pill form.
Knee arthrocentesis-https://youtu.be/gEycRncwuNU
We all know what we where thinking when we saw the white
I can do that without a pill and syringe
What is the use??
I used to do that for my cat who needed Sucralfate. It really helps the pill to melt quicker.
Did myself this three years ago . Lol should have post it then 😂
Make sure it isnt a time release perscription....some pills are designed to release medication over a period of time
It's cool but who have a surgical syringe in their house?!?!?
Saved me haha my dog has degenerative disc disease so he needs medicine a lot, can't afford surgery, but this helps so I can give as liquid instead of with treats
Lookin kinda sus
That white stuff looks very SUS!🤔  SUS-PICIOUS!

Its called cavitation.
Man oxy has never ben ezeyer
Here’s an idea. Don’t do this, unless you want to speed run destroying your kidneys. Pills are the way they are (hard packed together) so that when it reaches the stomach and starts to dissolve, it’s a slow dissolve  into your system. If you take pills like this you’re just going to shock your system and most likely harm vital organs
They don't teach that in Medical School because, in 30 years of Critical Care/Trauma Nursing, I NEVER saw an MD pushing meds in a feeding tube...
It looks like he’s donating to a sperm company
Cum 😳 OH I MEAN THIS VIDEO IS VERY HELPFUL 😇
Looks like cu-
He be out there with the roofies
I can make some of that without the pill 😈
I saw some people thinks this is done to inject. they are liquifying it to adminster the medicine through ryle's tube.(and not to inject it). Well we indian nurses use crusher to make powder out of pill.
I had to do this for my dog, unfortunately he passed away shortly after he became ill.

"after one little hit " That's what I said to myself when I was too high
That's so dumb what if their slow releasing.
Thanks 😊
I should do this for my dog. It's always a fight with big pills.
Dr's doing these videos are ruining medicine.
You remove the air and filled it with water What you expected to happen?
Up until I was atleast 14 I couldn't swallow pills. When I was a baby and unsupervised I got into a parent's medication and had to get my stomach pumped Iam sure I struggled due to my mishap this trick would of worked so much better than crushing pills up on a spoon with a little sugar and water cause that Mary Poppins bitch was full of shit it didn't help the medicine go down!
Lmao I figured this out while trying to give my cats their meds without them having to swallow a pill
You sure thats not something else? 😳
This is for boofing

🤨🤨
Why would med school teach you this, nurses administer the meds lol
Well i tried it on a tissue very disappointed it took around 5 min  i could get the same colour and amount every night in just 10 seconds
Until you realize some capsules and pills are only supposed to be open in gut, not mouth otherwise they don't have the optimal effect or have unwanted side effects
Looks kinda sus ngl

Most tabs this would need doing with are much smaller. Cool though
So much faster and way less hassle than simply swallowing it.
At the very end   Get your mind out of the gutter
That’s enough of YouTube today
that weird liquid looks familiar…
Its essentially creating a vacuum and sucking the air out of the pill. When the pressure equalizes water rushes into the spaces where the air was thus breaking it apart

My mother use to be in such pain that the doc told me to crush the pain killers and have her snort it like one would do for cocaine. Said it would kill the pain quicker. She nor I could do this though. What do you say about this technique @drkaran?
I knew this from nursing school… it’s effective to make carafate liquid to put thru a peg tube or for patients that can’t swallow pills… ( always check with pharmacy if the liquid form is available, and if not please check if it’s ok to crush the meds….)

I would recommend doing it on the hard part of your thumb not the soft part. Also this only really works with capsules some liquid gels and uncoated tablets it's a hell of a lot harder to do with coated tablets.
Why would I give a crap about this...?
what the hell???? and all this time ive just been wasting time crushing my lactase pills with spoons like an idiot??????
Don’t think you should be concentrating doses like this
it looks like something I could produce without a syringe.

They didn't teach this because it isn't an appropriate way of administering medications. They taste at which it breaks down and releases is effected and changes the life of the medication. This is a drug user hack that shouldn't be used for real medication!

I did that as a kid to take my adhd meds
My brother had a g- button and we used to use this method to give him most of his  meds through the MIC-KEY valve. Surprised this MD hasn’t seen this before.
Ayo what the fuckl
Umm, sister nurses and med techs, how many of you have already been doing this? 🤦🏿‍♀️
How to ratio the water for the pill?
ThAt lOoKs sUs
Omg stop my daughter has 6x meds daily I need to dilute... makes this so much easier !
"PUKE WAS HERE"  (You have been virtually vandalized))
I hope the psychos don’t see this video
Wait isn't that first dude in first part from the "Male Privilege is a Myth" change my mind episode 😂😂😂
Most meds are time release. So this would be bad to receive the entire medication in one hit. Many could have bad side effects. Same for your animals. Stop using social media for answers you need to seek from a professional!!!!
how to inject xanax
Thats looking pretty sus
But why??
Cum
Well you just taught crack heads how to get high
Cum
Doesn't work the same if the pill is already powder bruh...pushing the air out of the plunger we can see that it's crushed
What’s that white stuff
Should of done this with percs back in the day.
They didn't teach me on nursing school, somehow they did on my hospital😂🤣...
Why does it look li——-
Yeah it turns into, um . . . cu - wait, no. Pill water, yeah it turns into pill water.
Omg I needed this bcause I physically can't take pills tysm
You probably went to medical school in india so is ok
In vet med we do this all the time with sucralfate tabs. The more you know, right?
Cu-
That’s will make the syringe unsterile and the patient can get infection
Life changing
Nurses have been using this method for appropriate meds for years.  This is nothing new.
Now I can inject M30s thanks
It's Henry's law for solutions
Cool! Now I can drink OxyContin juice
I know what to do with Molly now.
Hehe i used to do this i just pull back and remove it from the syringe which creates a kind of loud pop sound
Coom
I miss him
Nice need this for my ib800s
Love a good boofing.
This is great for those that can’t swallow large pills
I give meds to horses like this, I usually just pop the pill in, with warm water and just shake it for a few seconds. Works just fine for me.
Finally I can take my pills that taste spicy with chips

We all know what this looks like
Why are you crying
🧄 garlic?
Ayo👀
A big pill and what???
I have watched this video over three times and still not understand what is it all about.
Do you consider yourself to be a good person? Most people do. However, most of us differ as to the definition of "good." The Bible says that God is good, and the Ten Commandments are His standard of goodness. So, we will look at God's Law . . . With a tender conscience, ask yourself if you have obeyed the following:   1. You shall have no other gods before Me. (Have you always loved God above all else?) 2. You shall not make yourself an idol. (Have you made a god in your mind that you're more comfortable with, a god to suit yourself?) 3. You shall not take God's name in vain. (Have you ever used God's holy Name as a cuss word?) 4. Remember the Sabbath Day, to keep it holy. 5. Honor your father and mother. 6. You shall not murder. (God considers hatred to be as murder). 7. You shall not commit adultery. ("Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart" Matthew 5:27-28; this also includes sex before marriage). 8. You shall not steal. (Have you ever stolen anything? the value of the item is irrelevant). 9. You shall not lie. (Have you lied even once? Including answering these questions). 10. You shall not covet. (Have you ever jealously desired what belongs to others?) The Bible says that God will punish all murderers, rapists, thieves, liars, adulterers, etc. He will even judge our words and thoughts. On Judgment Day, will you be found to be guilty or innocent of breaking His commandments?   Perhaps you think that God is good, and will therefore overlook your sins. But it is His goodness that will make sure that murderers, rapists, thieves, liars, etc. receive justice. He would be a corrupt Judge if He turned a blind eye to injustice. Have you kept the Commandments?   The Bible says that the Law is perfect. It commands you to be perfect (Matthew 5:48). Are you perfect (in thought, word, and deed)? Will you make it to Heaven? You may say that you are still good, but God says you're not (see Psalm 14:2-3). So one of you is lying, and the Scriptures tell us that it is impossible for God to lie. Remember that all liars will be cast into the Lake of Fire (Revelation 21:8). God's Law demands justice, and the penalty for sinning against Him is death and Hell. Listen carefully if you want to live.   God Himself made a way where His justice and His goodness could meet. We broke the Law, but He became a man to pay the fine. Jesus suffered and died on the cross to satisfy the Law. God can forgive us and grant us the gift of everlasting life! But you may still think that you can (from now on) keep the Ten Commandments. But isn't it true that the best of us have lied, stolen, lusted, hated, failed to love God above all else, and failed to love our neighbor as ourselves?   How can we then, live a "good" life if we have already sinned against God? At best we are reformed liars and thieves . . . but still Lawbreakers. Think of it this way - would you sell one of your eyes for a million dollars? Would you sell both for $50 million? I'm sure you wouldn't. Your eyes are priceless, yet they are merely the windows of your soul. What then must your life (soul) be worth? With these thoughts in mind, what would be a fair price to pay for everlasting life? It is utterly without price. Yet, if we trust in our own goodness to enter Heaven, we are saying to God, "I should enter Heaven because I have done good - I have earned my way in."   Imagine if you wanted to give me a brand new (very expensive) car, but I said, "I can't take it! I feel embarrassed receiving such a gift . . . here's 10 cents for it." I'm sure you would be very insulted by such a pathetic offer of payment. Besides, if I pay for it, it is no longer a gift, it's a purchase . . . it's mine by right.   When we talk of entering Heaven by being good, by trying to keep the Ten Commandments etc., we are tossing God 10 cents of "self-righteousness," which is a terrible insult to Him, in the light of His sacrifice. The only thing we can do is humble ourselves, repent of our sins, and receive the gift by trusting Jesus Christ alone. Almighty God demonstrated how much He loves you when Jesus suffered for you on the cross. If you want to trust in your own goodness, then you are saying His agonizing death on the cross was in vain. The Bible says, "For by grace are you saved through faith, and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God." You cannot earn a gift.   When Jesus said to "believe" on Him, He was saying we should have faith in Him, in the same way you would trust a parachute to save you when you jump from a plane. You don't merely believe in the parachute - you put it on. Please don't "jump" without Jesus. If you die in your sins there is no second chance. God will give you justice, and you will end up in Hell forever. Any troubles you have at present are dwarfed by the trouble you are in with your Creator. His wrath abides upon you (John 3:36). God doesn't want you to go to Hell. Neither do you want to go there, so confess your sins to God right now, put your trust in Jesus to save you, and you will pass from death to life. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. (See John 14:21). Your obedience to God is the proof of your love. Have faith in God, He will never fail you.   Pray something like this:   "Dear God, today I turn away from all of my sins (name them). This day I put my trust in Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior. He is the only way for me to be saved. He is 'The way, the truth, and the life.'" Please forgive me, change my heart, and grant me Your gift of everlasting life. In Jesus' name I pray. Amen."
Ok and?
Ummm....I could use this to put my meds in my morning coffee.
Is that for a specific type pill? Cause some pills can’t be liquidated
that second sig was 🔥

You obviously don't know everything! You should remind this to your self!
*starts writing in xanax*
This is a great tip for the next time my daughter needs to take pills as she is peg tube fed
Don't do this, can cause overdose and the medication not being active as long in the body. Use medication only as directed as many need to dissolve over a period of time!!
As a former addict of 30yrs I never come across a user do that?
Tell me why the background music is The Fray ~ How to save a life 😅  Am I the only one who notices this 😂😂
Cu?
I don't get it
What woww
What the heck is doing?
That looks like something else
all fun and games until you eat cream filled cupcakes at ur hookups house only to realise it tastes kinda bad
feeding tube people are just like “y’all seriously didn’t know this?”
Ayyyyoooooo
Cum pill
Dude looks like he could be Robert Pattinson brother lmfao
This is how I give medicine to my dog
Ummmmmm so much is wrong with this
I know what you are thinking
I've been using this on carafate ,works like a charm. That stuff wants to stay dry.
Could I do this with my pain meds then rub it on my skin...would it help with pain?
Why though
I do this with my kid’s chewable melatonin
Is it okay to do with painkillers like Paracetamol/Ibuprofen & Cocodamol/Codine?
Sooo do I still need to take pills
Can someone explain what this is doing
Anybody else thought this was an antivax tiktok for a moment?
Looks like semen 🤷🏾‍♀️
Where the heck was this when my kids were 3-10????
Lol learned this trick doing heroin
But putting your finger on top of that isn't that hygienic I guess. If I'm wrong guys kindly correct me
the music u put in the background is just cruel for the greys fans
Called a "Slurry". Worked excellent for pets.
Who has perks I’m trying see sum ?
"Follow for More" ? Follow who, You or the other guy
Doesn't work for real. I tried it.
wtf was the point in this?
This is not to be taught in medical college it's in class 12 textbook.
I could smell the comments from solar systems away
I'll overdose
This is my kingdom come
the end was sus
I had to use this with my grandma when I wanted to get her money
Follow for more of what, other people's TikTok's ? 💀
Korviga t Tubi
This is cooooool. My little sister has always struggled SO HARD because she's never been able to take a pill. Her doctors have struggled to treat her before because there isn't a non-pill solution for a lot of things. This is good to know!  ... even if she has to take her regularly scheduled pill with a chaser ahahahaha 🤣🤣🤣
Well it's a thermodynamic process occur due to turbulence in irreversible reaction
Cool, now I can make Lexapro cake frosting
Useful for pets
Stop showing kids tricks bro
So he liquefied a pill cool phhh.

Time released????? Don't do this!!!
I learned this in Aberdeen children's hospital from a nurse, best tip ever
Ask your nurses
Good to give children and pet tablets ..

Dick pill and two cc's got it
no one:  me: *liking the video so I can try this cuz I can't swallow p!lls*
Gotta make some perc drizzle
Okay but what's the purpose of this trick in our lives. 😅
This can help people, specially kids, who are unable to swallow pills. I remember my mom dissolving my tablets in a spoon and feeding me as I had a hard time swallowing pills as a kid. As long as you injest it and not inject it.
Crackology 101
That’s also very good and helpful for veterinary purposes in medicine so true I’ll do that next time thank you!
you don't learn how to give meds in medical school because you don't give the meds on the job 🤣🤣🤣
I read medical as middle and now I feel dumb
Yooooooooooo🥴
The song in the background is how to save a life by the fray
What that white stuff
Omgggggg thank you! This is so useful for giving my cat her meds
Why would you need to know this? We already have this white stuff inside us
Y'all didn't take physics?  Dumb mfs
Or.. just let the air do its thing and shake in the syringe itself..
I can do that !
My mom was doing this in the 90s. How the hell are y’all just figuring this out????
It has worked for me
Looks like a mysterious white liquid that most people know
Ayo... That look like y'all all know
I forgot the name of the med atm, but we do this at the vets office I work at for a certain pill
jizzing all over the counter
Why would I follow you when you watched someone else’s video? Why wouldn’t I follow them?
This is way better then using the silent knight and clogging the peg tube

So what's the point of doing this??
Scrubs
That's sussy
There is a reason why we shouldn't crush medication 🙄
Oh so date rape drugging shall be done to not only drinks but possibly deserts as frosting 😏
Equine trick to give horses oral meds. Works like a charm
Of course a Dr doesn’t know this it’s us nurses who admin meds Id recommend re caping not using a dirty thumb
They do teach that in pharmacy school
This may be helpful for children who can't yet swallow pills. I'd check with my pediatrician first, though.
Farm girls have known this trick for decades....its how we give meds to livestock.
Bill Cosby can now put icing on the cake!!
What
Come
If you do this make sure it's a medication that will still absorb if dissolved. I take levothyroxine for thyroid which is a tiny pill so it's maybe not the best example but it absorbs best if dissolved in the stomach. This might go for some bigger pills too so just be warned that you check.
Who else learns a bunch of random things you know you won’t need from YouTube?Yet you store it anyway for that 1 percent off chance you would need it? Just me ok
This should not be allowed on you tube. Teaching young ppl this shit is not what the 🌍 needs...
cüm core 😍
Tried it 2 days ago with some natrium chloride pills, gosh didn't work well. It was al smashed inside top of the soringe. Couldn't get it out through the PEG and mi- key button.
Lol. Try this on some 10meq k+ tablets. Those things NEVER fully dissolve.
This is my kingdom come.
So somebody gonna use this to drug somebody else….
How you got the medicine 💊 in there thou🤔
Hurts like a mf though
Love all the edits 🙄. Sure it works after it sits in the water for an hour to completely dissolve the pill
This would definitely help Boofing meds
Everyone in veterinary medicine is laughing
Wait what is this for?
Wow. Exactly how a drugaddict does it with pills that does not need other preperations 🤔
No thanks .. I already sign my name with white stuff . 😈
Not the song reminding me of Grey's anatomy ❤️ how to save a life
Fun fact this is why some of us can’t swallow pills and if you do swallow them it takes longer to do anything
https://youtu.be/akHIK1BcCnM
What is the point of this video? No pun intended
This isn't medicine, just physics... Your school should've taught you this 😂
Bill Cosby just got a new recipe for his cake frosting
Just say no to drugs
Junkies have been doing that since oxy hit the streets
Boutta go touch grass
My nursing class tried this it doesn't really work. Medications get stuck and won't crush unless they sit for a while in the solution. It worked best to crush first! (Also it hurts like a b with too much pressure)
Nice now the pill doesn't work anymore because the stomach acid van destroy it without its protection coat
So I've herd ... Idk
Load 1/2 gram meth and 1/2 gram h4 and booty bump it ....your good for 2 days
They didn't teach us in biology class either
No shit though
“Bill Cosby has entered the chat” lol. I’m just kidding y’all
We tell owners to do this for certain medications at the vet clinic I work at, especially for some cats
We would have to do this for my cousin who has a G-Tube
Wait literally 5 month ago I would be to afraid to take pill due to being scared of choking and would always crush it up and put it in liquid when I could’ve just did this-
It’s supposed to dissolve.
I knew this only cause my dog needed pills and wouldn’t eat them regular. Told vet and they told me to do this and just put it in treat or would shoot it in his mouth
Will this let me booty bump my Zoloft?
I can make an ibuprofen glaze😁 Not an adult treat I dreamed about, but what desperately want
Make instant pickles and put  cucumbers in pickle juice in applying a vacuum
Dang he cute.
It’s the How To Save A Life by The Fray (instrumental version) for me
Because you didn't join medical school lmfao
I wish i knew this when i was shooting up roxies 10 yrs ago
This definitely isn’t new. I’m glad you learned it though.
WTF!!! I wish I had known this when I was giving my kid Keppra through her g-tube!!!!
I’m definitely adding laxatives 🌝👩🏻‍🦯👩🏻‍🦯👩🏻‍🦯👩🏻‍🦯👩🏻‍🦯👩🏻‍🦯
Ah ok. And then what?? I.V? Intramuscular? Subcutaneous? Oral (which will likely taste terrible.
This could also lead to over dose
Perky slush
God bless
Yeah, because physicians totally administer medications all the time..............
How could medical school teach you common sense you have it or you don’t.
Wouldn’t this defeat the purpose of the drug? I mean if the drug is supposed to dissolve in a specific area of the body then this method will defeat the purpose of it.
Just playing around with my daughters one day, I playfully..(😉) swallowed an M&M. I laughed a little, asked them if they could do it.  They giggled and tried and did, and it was cool and cute and kinda fun. 👍 Then when it came time to "swallow" a pill, they would scrunch their face and look very distressed at the thought, until I reminded them, "You swallowed an M&M didn't you?" 😏
Simply amazed how I've been scrolling through these short vids for two hours now. WTF
one of those things i assumed everyone knew ; i'm sure many thing i don't know that everyone else does - so this isn't a braggy thing lol
That doesn't look legit....
This is unnesacary to have on here, with the amount of drug addicts in this world... 💔 I can see why it would help people with needs of getting a baby or an animal to take meds tho. That's it.
I’m scared to swallow pills I have no idea why but this makes me feel better
I wouldn't want to drink the liquid pills,  they taste awful enough when you swallow them whole
A daily routine for a veterinarian
How the fudge did he get the pill in the syringe?
Cool
This is so stupid. The world is going down.
He learned that from his frat bros to roofie women
I remember when it was time for me to take a pill and I don’t know how and I was scared to death I eventually learn several years later but wow Still can’t believe they’re people my age that can’t swallow pills
I’ve been an intervenous drug abuser for years and you just have me the greatest thing thank you 🙏
yeah cool hack, now ppl can shoot paracetamol right in their radial artery
This is great cuz my grandpa hates taking his meds or he takes them so slow
It playing how to save a life in the background. I'm 95% sure
Wait a minute… Wasn’t the original video a tutorial for doing this method as a way for someone to boof a pill??
U cant do that with any kind of medication
gonna troll my mom later
The drizzle made me want a toaster strudel
Makes it way easier to boof pills
What’s the point though ?
I actually have ptsd from pills, this just helped in so many ways.
I use to shoot diladas up which you cant really do this with regular needle but cod just crush it up and pour it in the back of the rig and shake shake shake and boom my legs would go over my head lol. Glad I’m sober now (3 years)
What? Why would you do that?
Oooo I’m gonna try this on my cats meds tomorrow
Makes sense, similar effect to a vacuum chamber.
😑 or you can just swallow it. Has no one ever take a animal pak all in one shot 💪
Not they got recovering heroin addicts teaching us tricks lmaooo
I do this all the time in paeds! 😁
I know a few friends with special needs children with g-tubes that only recently learned this!
My pills all taste disgusting...this would just make it worse. Glad I can swallow pills just fine. But useful for animals and people with trouble swallowing pills.
When I was a kid used to play a lot like that with syringe. Not new for me!
This is good for people who can’t swallow pills
Add metformin to your cake 😏
Hey get a syringe put it on your sis/bro pull the thing and release if u do it right it can hurt
I’m drawing happy faces and sun shines wit all my perks and xans for now on
Is it just me but i want to try this so badly . 😂
RN almost 10 years. I have NEVER seen a doctor administer a medication toa patient in pill form. Anesthesia giving sedation, sure. ED doc pushing propofol to set a shoulder, by all means. But NEVER have I seen a doc crush a pill to give it enterically.
It works great for carafate with pets.
Hurts ya thumb but it works a dream. We've been having to give our elderly cat meds and he wouldn't try them so I suggested this, SO much easier!
Thank you cuz I refuse to swallow pills rs
John 3:16 “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.”
Looks susss,👏 😮
😳
This could be handy,  maybe for micro-dosing especially in a tapering situation?
This is good if you have to take your pills through a stomach port. My friend had to after a motorcycle accident and the nurse taught us this.
boof it u won’t
My mum needs to do this!!! She has bad gullbladder....
How to boof
This is what junkies do fyi
Yeah, this is how you shoot up pills 😒
Idk that looks alot like Panacur or to me...
Believe in Jesus Christ and be saved from hell before it’s eternally too late if you haven’t
My daughter had both an NG Fube and G Tube and this trick saved us!
I did it and brake the whole thing in 1000 pices
😯😯😯
I have to call him now. 💦
Well we have to make entertainment for ourselves as health care. Thanks DOC
Thank you.. I will now take my percs like this.
Dr. Crosby Style
Doing this to a perc 😍
Wow so cool
These comments 😭😭😭
Me when I was 14
This maybe the magic we've been waiting for all along.
This changes the absorption rate of the pill though.
I'd use this for my cat or myself when I need to take my big pills that won't go down. Obviously only with the correct type of pill but it's a good idea if I'm too drained to swallow big ones without struggling.
This will help me save time helping my 72 yr old mother who's currently going through chemo about every 3 weeks & not wanting to take her meds,  I thank and appreciate you & this video sooooooo very much!!! Thank you again!!!!💯💯💯💜😘
Please don't do this.
I JUST REALIZED HOW TO SAFE A LIFE IS PLAYING
I should call him….
*AAYYYOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO*
totally not a rickroll https://youtu.be/toY3LN_-4y4
I think I know the science here Pills like that are formed by compressing powder, but it doesn't take out *all* of the air. So when you completely degas the syringe and form a vacuum, the air pockets in the pill expand rapidly and the powder comes apart and disperses into the water Just a theory but im pretty sure that's what's happening
How I test my percs
Imma do that with my ecstasy pills😬
Former Drug addicts know this one too… I do have to admit..
I looked away and looked back and I just seen a whole bunch of white stuff on the table💀
I couldve sworn i heard "dick pill"
KNOW that all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. Romans 3:23.  UNDERSTAND the wages of sin is death. Romans 6:23.  CONFESS that Jesus Christ is Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead. Romans 10:9  REPENT of your sins Luke 13:3 READ and STUDY God's Word to show yourself approved. 2 Timothy 2:15  PUT ON the whole armor of God. Ephesians 6:11  BEWARE of the son of perdition who is coming first disguised as Jesus to oppose and exalt himself above all that is called God, or worshipped.  2 Thessalonians 2:3,4  WATCH and PRAY until the true Christ returns. Luke 12:37 Remain as a chaste virgin waiting for  her true husband. (Christ)2 Corinthians 11:2 Shepherds Chapel on YouTube explains the whole Bible God bless
I thought the point was for the pill to take time in your stomach to give a longer effect and not over saturate your system with medication too fast 😮
🤨
I learned that in both emt-p class and LVN school. Surprisingly, I was the only in my RN program who knew it
When timed release isn't fast enough for you.
Damn now people gonna be taking shots of xans 😂
I need to stop getting the dezovabul Claritins lol
I thought there was garlic in there and I got excited because I thought it was an easy way to turn a glove of garlic into paste.
Very interesting!
There is no such thing as a tiktok doctor. Real doctors do not have time to waste on a teen girls app LOL
I had to use a  terrible pill grinder for my grandmas feeding tube. She had to have like 8 pills a day 😭
Why was there a chili pepper near the syringe..........
Ummmm
Dang
ARE YOU KIDDING ME! I have a feeding tube and have to grind my medication to take it. This is insane and looks so easy. I was in the hospital for 33 days and no one showed me this trick. Almost 2 years with a feeding tube and I'm still happy I just saw this video! Thank you, Thank you!
How about children's chewable vitamin.. my daughter is fed through g tube & I have to crush her vitamin
good idea for people with feeding tubes
PERCOCET 30 HE ATE IVE BEEN GETTIN OFF 😴
Could this work for nitros or baby ASA, or even Zofran if their mouths are dry?
😳
How have no one actually knew this
Thank you, I'm using this for my cats meds
Finna go drink my xans
BOOF IT
This doesn’t work for all pills. And shouldn’t be recommended to everyone; as has been pointed out, there are may pills that should NOT be crushed or slurries in order to work correctly or to protect the stomach.
GASP 😮 Nursing school failed me!
What is the liquid I cannot understand what he is saying over the music..
Negative pressure + moisture = fast dissolution. You can do the same thing with snacks in your mouth too. For example take half or a quarter of a oreo cookie or a cracker. Hold it in a "chamber" you make with your tongue and the roof of your mouth sucking on the cookie/cracker or whatever. And voila! You now have a mushy oreo cookie with no chewing haha
Or u could just use one of the multiple pill crushers located around the med carts 🤔
I should call him..
I used to do this when I did dope 😞  ETA I did meth. Not heroin. I don’t see how this would work with heroin in my area.
All the junkies across the world are like "Really?? No one knew this"?? Lol
The pinned comment about enteric coatings...  those can be hard to recognize... Here's an easier way:.Any medication that comes with a warning to "TAKE WITH FOOD" is not likely to be appropriate for this trick as they are the types of medications that CAN become more damaging to the stomach and throat linings the faster they are absorbed.
Actually useful thank you.
That soft how to save a life in the background
I don’t know why but that’s kinda sus
Is this safe...?
Use this method with ibuprofen and apply directly to acne :)
Was I the only one who thought he said “Dick Pill” and was genuinely confused asf to what was going on.
could this work for magnesium pills?
Gr8 for boofing
Now the rappers will find this helpful
Amazing! No need for med crusher anymore. 😁
I am so sorry .. But what am I looking at??? I'm so confused?? Lol
And for what is this ?
SUS PILLS😳😳😳
As a pharm tech i cant tell you how many times we showed people this.
What's the point bruh??
Should’ve done this for my dogs meds 🤣
Dry cook
F A K E
Wait till they hear about injection aspiration and the lack of it in current use cases.
It absolutely does not dissolve in one pump, ex-druggie here
they taught me this working at a nursing home
That has to come from parent or a dog parent who needed to get meds down his child 🤣🤣
Can you test with the chili next please
Idk why, I thought this was a garlic hack
Boutta frost a cake in perc 30
It's  true but it hurts to pop that needle like that lol 😂😂😂
What this for
But why is there a chili pepper in the window?
I had to listen a couple times 🤣... I did not hear "Big Pill" the first 3 times 🤦🏾‍♀️
Omg ima use this on all my peg patients
Weak as f 0 post please
Gtube  meds in 2 seconds 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Odd they dont teach you this in nursing school but its one of the first things you learn while working in a barn 😂🤷‍♀️
I did this for my grandma when she was on hospice and it was too hard for her to swallow pills. Very helpful.
Can I do this with metformin 1,000 MG someone tell me please it’s difficult to swallow that pill! If I liquify it I’d remember not to skip it
This is good for kids who don’t like chewing pills
This is good for kids who don’t like chewing pills
It looks like…     Condensed milk
Stop fuckin lying!
I don’t get it what’s the point just to make weird goo?
Trying this with krokodil next
Do I hear "how to save a life"??
Liquid medication usually goes down fine with some gingerale
I was like 885k
Must have been a heroin user who showed this guy his trick and is now trying to ride it to glory ... 🤣
Learnt this from Bondi Vets lol
This does work pretty well on a lot of meds. Can't use it on coated or slow release medicine however but its great when you don't have a pill mill.
Sussy
Sorry but I think I missed what this is about? I thought it was an enema!!! 🤔😊
Druggies do a similar thing called cold water extraction. Put your opioids in cold water until the acetaminophen dissolves and strain the liquid out with a cloth.
For those wondering the song is How to Save A Life by The Fray
Vary creative could've saved a fortune for  pharmacy service on  cat meds.
Originated from drug addicts
I might have ADHD and most likely anxiety and my mom said I might have to have to start taking pills if I'm diagnosed and I have a severe fear of swallowing pills or pills in general so I am not so scared anymore
This is how you get pets to take meds too. That or just wrap it in cheese
This is an old mom trick. Lol
Omg. This would’ve been such a time-saving tool for tube feedings & folks with swallowing problems. They should teach things like this in med & nursing schools.
It doesn't work. It only dissolves the outer coating of the pill. At least it did for me.
Boof
Hahahahaha when did the doctor even serve the medication lol called bs on this
Why would they teach you that? No disrespect but when is the last time a doctor/resident ever gave meds thru an ngt or any other way? I’ve never seen. Not once
it's practical and easy but it's very unsterilized process also
А что это в шприце?
Don’t do drugs kids .
This isn’t a better way to take medicine bc medicine dissolves in your body and if it’s already dissolved when you take it it’s not going to work as well if you take the actually pill
Going to get creative when I pop percs now, thank you.
Well that's medical school for yuh....you just gotta learn old school
School didn't teach me that pills dissolve and water either. I'm just not retarded so I already knew that
Guysss!!!
What on earth did you write a prescription for with that stuff?!
Deep
Because hospitals already make pills liquid or solid, they are already prepare but nice trick form an emergency or someone can really take a solid pill 💊
I just watched a video on how to make pickles using the same idea.
It’s not sanitary
Kingdom come
Secret to getting pills down the infirmed.....butter. coat the pill in butter, you can even then kind of pinch the pill and shoot it to the back of the throat where goes down much easier lubricated with the butter. I did that with my infirmed  mother we did like 20/30 pills a day like that it was so easy
Then boof that shit lmao
Uhh that aint a pill chief
WE ROCKIN W DA PERCY SYRUP?
I didn't learn this in nursing school, and unless your a field medic it's probably not ok.  I just taught an MD how to give an IM injection the other day, so I'm not thinking Madical school teaches too much about this sort of thing
Damn that would have been beneficial a year ago when I had a feeding tube
Hey man where do you keep your syringes?   Oh right between my random sitting chili pepper and pinnapple! Duh 🙄
Wow thats interestig
omg so good for the puppers
Hehe looks like c um
Some pills are meant to dissolve in the stomach. They say don't chew so it doesn't dissolve too early
At work at the moment...I work in UC btw...Doctor doesn't recommend this. Some meds aren't meant to be absorbed in the duodenum...this would be the best way for the absorbency of some medications
Hm.. how to feed cats medication
A year and a half ago, my son came home from the NICU with meds and a NG tube. Unlike the liquid form meds my son took while in the hospital, the meds were in pill form.  Before discharge, the hospital's pharmacist taught us this method to help give my son's meds slowly through his NG tube.  I was truly amazed!
Don't do that. It can force air under your skin and into your blood  :)
There’s a coating for a reason buddy
Dangerous TIP- A LOT of medications are NOT supposed to be liquefied- they're meant to dissolve slowly etc don't do this without knowing wth you're doing ppl
I think it's the thumb and opening a sterile barrel why it's not tought
That’d be fantastic for giving meds via peg tube.
boofing for dummies
That would taste nasty, give me the pill instead.
What is the purpose of doing this?
What just happened?
What is that?
is that-
Ok the algorithm need to chill. I seen something like this half a year to a full year ago and was thinking of that video not 3 days ago. I didn't say anything about it, I didn't type anything about it. Smh predictive suggestions cam be creepy sometimes. Lol
This is nothing new....I've been doing it for years with my son's meds!
Now you can add your “pill” as frosting on all your favorite desserts!
Why
Aint nobody got time for that, especially  if your pt has 10+ meds. Crush those meds and  go
Don't eat everything at the hospital
Been a nurse for lots of years and never saw that. Sweet!
Dis what pill grinders are for but ig its nice for it to already be mixed in water
Thanks to this video now I know how to shoot up pills
perks gon hit different
This would’ve been nice to know when Shaina was on her course.
Nice teaching some how to shoot 💊 intelligent 👌
I think ANY kid who grew up in FL knows this because...how else would you get down on Friday Night? Also, did anyone notice the background song?
Also should be mentioned..... this hurts like a MF'r
Now I can drink my Perkys
Ok my pills still hard as a rock😟
This shouldn’t be on here I’m sorry I don’t want my kids know how to do this😡
And it also tastes horrible now
Physeptone tablets in a 10ml barrel. The good old 'chalky' days... 😂
Your Brillant thank u
You're just dissolving the pill, am I missing something here?  Crackheads been doing this lol
2cc of what? Acetone?
Oh I need this for my doggy thank you
This is great for giving horses medicine!
And... Who would drink that shit???
I do this to pill my cats
🤨
Mf saw a guy do something copied it exactly then was like "follow for more" wtf 🤠
Fake!
Big tablets like that usually are slow release so aren't meant to be bitten or devolved so could cause issues with your liver or kidneys or just not work as it should do so doing this might not be such bad good idea. But it could be a good thing for maybe a child needing some medication for an acute treatment or a pet needing a treatment
Maybe I'm being dumb..... Why would you do this?
i just wanna say how to save a life is a fucking beautiful song
Why do that?
I can definitely use this at work. Thanks a lot !
Not all medicines are good for this because they’re made to be broken down a certain way and modifying that messes with its effectiveness
Nice
I always waited me meds to melt , this would gave been handy when my son had his g tube and we put meds thru it
I knew this and im barely 13 😅
Ayoooooo 🤨🤨🤨
Looks like a Potassium CL. I simply hold one in my mouth with a sip of water, and it dissolves in a few seconds.  I will experiment with Colestid, as those are a bitch.
Coom
Damn, mine's delayed release Boooooo
Pharmacy school taught me this but you have to make sure the drug can be crushed
I'm gonna try doing this with my oxys
Finna take sum Perc 30s like they ain nun😮‍💨
sus
Ummmm… ok, nurse for over 20 years here… I’m shook. Lol.
But wtf is it still teaching? Like for real???
I hate taking pills! I will be using this method from now on
And what's the use of this?why in the hell would they teach this in medical school
This is actually smart especially for people who dont like pills or are scared of them
Oops, I ejaculated on the shelf again.
Will this work on candy? I don't like hard candy. Feels like my teeth my break
Nothing, Nothing says why????
Is this how u shoot up
I have been a nurse since 1996 and had to crush tons of meds to give to hospice patients, patients with G-tubes and several pets. Dang! I wish I would have known this. 🤦🏻‍♀️ Thanks for the info and can't wait to try it out.
That shit is crazy I wonder what pill he used
Please note this IS NOT SAFE with every pill. Do NOT do this with slow release pills. You could poison yourself
Could U Mimic?
Does that work with heroin?
That's immediate taste bud death and a quick vomit. No thanks but great job
inject someone with the pepper that was next to your syringe
Anybody else notice the Grey’s Anatomy music in the background?
Dang!
so im the only dirty minded one
ooooh so the air spring thing is intentionally and my mother didn't had to scream at me saying I would break ot when I was 10
I had an old Mexican abuela show me this trick. I don't speak Spanish, she spoke no English, but she was able to teach me and she was so tickled to see how surprised I was.
Is nobody gonna say what that looks like
I’m blind. What’s happening here?
But you’re diluting the medicine aren’t you?
So what?
You better check if you can take the pill that way cuz some pills need to be taken in pill form a time-release purposes and I bet a whole bunch of purposes that a pothead like me doesn't know about
HOW TO MAKE JIZZ!!!
Oh nooo! I hope people don’t start doing this 🤦🏾‍♂️……sigh.
NO ONE TELLS U HOW MUCH IT HURTS UR THUMB THO,it's like a mini punch to the thumb after each pull 😭
But why
If you’re reading this Jesus Christ loves you unconditionally and He will never leave you ❤️💛❤️💛❤️💛❤️
Neato
Lets be real, no docs out there giving meds lol
Yes. For my animals. Right.
Don't just do this with your pills without checking with a pharmacist first
Perky time
My mama showed me this she was a home health aid then a Rn
Why would it be appropriate for any?  These things taste terrible.
Artificial smegma
It's cvm😍😍😩🤞💅
Drug addict licking their lips rn
This would be good for cat pills.
Looks a bit sus
Coom 😍
Of course medical school didn't teach a lot of things..there are a lot of things medical school have to cover or we'll graduate after 10years if something like this had to be in the syllabus 😅 .it will all come in experience. But it is a common practice in hospital that i work in..*experience*
Won’t work on coated pills..
N u t t
sus
They only teach you this on the streets
Whoever knew if you crushed the pill in water it becomes pill water wow
how about nah
Incredible 😵‍💫
I learned to do that with my horse's antibiotics years ago from his veterinarian.   I am not a medical professional and knew this.
🤔  *vine boom fx
The Bad News- You are naturally a born sinner and have broken at least one of the law (10 commandments) at least once in your life (Example: a lie) (James 2-10 says if you break one of these laws, its the same as breaking them all), so because of this you're on your way to hell already, everyone is (Romans 3-23)  The Gospel (Good News): JESUS, Who is GOD in the flesh, came into the world and died for us, to free us from the curse of the law (10 commandments) and ressurected on the third day so that whosoever BELIEVES in HIM will not perish but have everlasting life!  GOD said this!  GOD cannot lie (Titus 1-2, Hebrews 6-18) we can lie because we are sinners.  JESUS saved us already (Colossians 2-14) Just BELIEVE and TRUST in HIM!  HIM ALONE, anyone who gives you another Gospel, whether an angel or one of us, let him be accursed, like it says in (Galatians 1 6-9) JESUS ALONE! Not religion, Trust in HIM and you will receive the GIFT of THE HOLY SPIRIT. GOD HIMSELF! Repent ye and BELIEVE the GOSPEL (Mark 1-15). AMEN!AMEN!!
This is some junkie shit. I know because I am one (clean for 3.5 years)
Bill Cosby is going to love this
They really don’t teach much in doctor school anymore .
Im doing this with my dogs
so we just aint gonna talk about what was in that first syringe
Don't do that I learned that in grade 4 syringes & air should never mix near your flesh 💉🤲🚫🚫🚫🚫!🙅
Need this for the dogs
Thought it was spermicides
As a ex drugs user i knew this 😉
What a neat trick !   But i would be more apt to use it for my pets 😊✌️
That looks like k due it's made to do that you're u can tunn she likes I'll in few mins of fluid work time.
This is so helpful!! Idk how but I don’t like swallowing pills cuz i always think I’m choke on it
You’re supposed to take them whole so they dissolve in your stomach, not in your mouth
that liquid looks a tad bit sussy
That looks like cu-
This hurts your finger by the way
😏
Did he say “that dick pill in 2ccs?
Does this affect the formula of the pill?
I did this and my thumb hurt SO BAD. Idk what I did wrong but the pressure snapped back at me like a bee sting 😂 😭
U KNOW ppl gunna bang time released opiods w. This tip and die right?
Why does it look so familiar 😆😆😆
Negative Pressure.  Vaccum.  Pill  was in Vaccum,  High pressure suddenly introduced makes this Sorcery possible. Would of been a temp change as well.
Pressure affects the boiling temperature of water
i dont understand..
Perky sauce
That big pill is big for a reason. 99% of the time is because it is a time release medicine.  This ruined its purpose!
Pretty sure that "art" at the end was really his signature 😂
We're the pharmacists right now?!?!?!?!
😳
Kind of looks like you know what never mind
Now leave it for people to find and assume
All the crackheads are like  👀 📝 lol 😂
Yours looked like something else
This is my kingdom come
Pulls the air out of the pill
**completely copies someone**   "Follow for more!"
In love
Great now more ppl are shooting up opioids
Sus 😐
What did he put inside?
I taught myself by accident and I’m not a nurse.
That would have been helpful ab a week ago- 💀
He had 3 cuts in the video also
Coom
Instagram fake doctor reacted to this 🤷🏻‍♂️😂 meds are coated for a reason
Why is there just a random ass Chile 😂
and then you are supposed to squirt it on the counter? & what? lick it off? im confused.
This would have been so much easier as a teen. I couldn't swallow large pills when sick my tonsils would swell up so bad.
my teacher just had me do this in biology class 💀
This is a like physics
I've had a feeding tube for 2.5 years and, man, I wish I knew this before!!
Just take the pill you pussies
But . . . Why?
How to Boof
Needle on it
Not going to lie. I thought your name for a quick second was Dr.Karen. 😂
Is it just me, or doesn't this hurt anyone else's thumb? I have to leave a little air in or it stings like crazy.
Vet techs: you're new here aren't you? *makes sucralfate slurry*
This is gonna be soo helpful when I give my Dad his medicine now!
Uhm if it wasn’t taught don’t you think it’s not supposed to be used?
Why tho.? For ppl who cant swallow pills.?
AMD what is this supposed to be used for?
What about capsules?
😙
Another under the bridge tip brought to u by crab denims...dont boil em till u wear em
No they didn’t teach you that in medachool. You probably did learn it while dry cooking heroine my boy
Oh so when I do this with my penis its gross but when someone does it with a syringe it's cool, SMH.
I feel like this video teaches drug addicts how to mix there solution to shoot up
Now it's ready to boof...
Follow for stealing more people's ideas
Anyone see anything else
Thank you. I have a son who can't take pills. Thank you again.
This gotta be some drug addict shit
They did not teach us this in the streets no way
Hun have you seen my plunger? 'Yeah it is by the chili pepper and pineapple where you always keep it'
Lol, I learned this trick when giving meds to my old retired horse. Makes life so much easier!
That's a big potassium pill they do dissolve this quick.
Yo tf this isnt advisable for all MEDS. But yeah.
I think we all know what this really looks like
Can we do this with all pills ?
This saved my life in a trip with a little kid that would not swallow her preventive malaria treatment. Life saver trick
Yes. I had a feeding tube for a couple years and this is how I took my meds.
You lie
Use this for icing
Sus
Them ruphies about to hit different🤣🤣🤣
Perfect for crushing oxys before filtering and slamming right on     Trollface.jpg
heroin users who already knew about this
This works wonders for feeding tube moms
*lol never thought I would learn a skill/technique from a bloody tik tok but you still have to wear gloves doing this aaand gloves no gloves. You’re not supposed to be in direct contact with the actual med. from bottle to cap to medicine cup. Let’s say you do use gloves would the pressure tear a piece and get into the syringe? Anyway still cool extremely convenient. Talk about a time saver. Do this once you’ve gotten your license. I wouldn’t advise showing off this technique during clinicals  or as a resident would like or when the board shows up lol*
I’m ab to be popping xans and percs like a beast
I'm so lost
Can this be used for any pill or do some of them have to be taken the regular way?
https://youtube.com/channel/UCbsCOZlqtqiy2lVENA1bEAQ
Gonna use this for my cats medicine
Me just wondering why he has a pinapple and a pepper sitting on his window sill
Great vid man 👍
Ksksjskskksksksskhdkwks jdhdjdks wtf, this is suicide
Ah yes the lovely guy at the Covid vaccination tent was doing the same thing he also heated up the vaccine on a spoon before he injected me what a nice guy.
Well damn 😂
I think the reason why this isn’t taught is because they design the pills to release at certain parts at tee body
Okay wow? Now I can feed my cat pills easily ~
THIS IS FAKE. Pause it right when the second guy holds it up after he pulls the water in, the pill is already powder. He switched it. Stop spreading misinformation and get a life. Ewe.
What is this for??
They haven’t taught me this yet in pharmacy
The mortar and pastel is now obsolete
Why is the syringe next to pepper
😯😯😯 This would've been so helpful when I was giving my infant her aspirin through a feeding tube!!
I did this at work once and the top shot off and my clients medication went all over the wall. Not worth it
DUDE IVE BEEN PRESCRIBED SO MANY PILLS WITH NO GUMMY OPTION BECAUSE MY JAW IS FUCKED UP AND I HAVE A HARD TIME SWLLOWING I WISH I KNEW THIS BEFORE
They didn’t teach us.
Is that an extended release? Enteric coated? 🤔🤔🤔
Omg thank you!  My kid has medical ptsd from having cancer and retches just from seeing a bottle of medication, this will help so much.
What can u even do with this
Oh thanks now i can finally OD on blues
This doctor doesn't follow instructions very well... kind of concerning.
ain’t no way liquid perc
Epic prank on friend gone wrong (I filled the milk jug with opioid water and he overdosed)
In vet, We só this all the time rs.
So you didn’t know that pills dissolve in water
So,  what's the point of doing this? I don't really understand.  It just seems like you're trying to dissolve the pill? I really don't understand.  It seems like a waste of good medicine just to make a cool video of shooting something out of the syringe?? PLEASE READ I'M NOT TRYING TO BE A KAREN I'm not bothered by the one pill waste for this I just don't get why someone would do this??? Can you inject it into a patient to make the medicine work faster??
Fun fact the video was edited and you can do this with hot or cold water
Fun fact this hurts like a bitch ..  you’re welcome
I do this lmao
What is the point? I don’t understand
Aspirin flavored mayonnaise!!! Now my sandwich will be Awesooooome!!!
Is that what they call a caldo de oso?
Dang, I crushed my dogs pills and dissolved them in Enfamil or Similac when she was battling cancer... wish I knew this trick then! Nice.
Finally... drinkable crack
New way to shoot up
Some crackhead at 7 eleven showed me this right before he shot up heroin
This will help me do drugs easier
OMG this will help so much giving my little dog meds!!!
Of course they don’t teach this in medical school, physicians don’t give meds, only nurses.
Ok This has real world application. I could make a joke but it would be to easy
Eewww
Good for at home care for alzheimers,Parkinsons and other ways to help get it down
Scary that our medical students need to be taught common sense
This is what we do in the Veterinary Field for our patients who we can’t pill
Men at sea
Hot Dr, looks like a cast member for the show ER.
I have a condition that makes it so I puke violently nonstop, and I’ve been tempted to learn how to turn my anti nausea pills into an IV, since it’s quite literally the only way to get something in me when I’m that sick. I’m gonna talk to my doctor about this for at-home use, maybe they can teach me to use a needle at home.
That's some real pill junkie kind of stuff
Shawn and Guster foreign knock offs?  I spotted the pineapple.
Is it just me or is this a lil sus
I like how everyone in the comments are grammatically correct and don’t sound like dumbasses
Does this work for animal meds?
Drug addicts know about this technique. Grateful to have left that life behind me 💜
What happened
This is wrong and bad. Time release pills are designed to be time released. You might as well take plunged dirt. Your expensive drugs will habe about the same effect.
Omg why
What is it?
Song is legit
Oh boy, what a lovely substance you have created! It would be awful if someone were to mistake it for anything but medicine, but I imagine that would be incredibly difficult seeing as it is coming out of a syringe.
This would be a much easier way to give an animal a pill. Thanks.  Hope this is real.
I bought a pill crusher for what?
*Heavy breathing*
What are you trying to show kid's how to mix up there pills this is stupid and ignorant
Thank you
I’ll try that when I’m giving tablet to my 4 months old baby.  Right now I’m dissolving her tablet in water, but have to usually wait and it never fully dissolve anyway. This could be a game changer! 😃
Who’s the guy in the fist video he’s cute?
They would teach it in physics class, LOL.  You are creating negative pressure which would greatly quicken the pills absorption of water.
Hehe coom
Hmm... not sure if I saw correctly what came out of that tube...
I used to prep my dogs morning meds in those
I'm a recovering heroin addict and want to touch on a few things. Due to all the people on this thread that are saying that this is what heroin addicts do. To start  off that this syringe is nothing like what we would use. This is built for a roid needle. What heroin addicts use is a diabetic needle and if you put dope straight into a syringe weather or not you pull back (which is not possible to even plug the tip with your thumb because the needle is attached).... Now let's say in theory you could pull back and it would somehow be able to mix then you would never be able to inject it because it would never go thru the needle that thick with all the cut in heroin and it would clog the little needles we use. Lastly your veins would collapse and not tolerate it with all the cut in it. There's a reason why dope is cooked and then drawn thru cotton and that's so you can heat it and liquefy it and then the cotton catches th solids. The way you describe it the drug injected would have to be pure fetanyl. Theres no such thing as a "dry cook" unless you are shooting pure or you are shooting meth. Not trying to be an expert on drugs that destroy lives, but just thought I should share my 15 year experience with this kinda thing since there's no other use for this kind of knowledge.
Can you do this with a Percocet? I’m asking for a friend 😅
Cool, now you get to taste it, hmmmm, yummy
I don't understand. Is it so medications can be liquidized to swallow?  It looked too goopy to inject. I've read other comments that praise this method, but I just don't quite get it. Either way, thanks for sharing. It's great when a YouTube short is actually useful.
Wow
But it tastes absolutely rank lol
This is so useful to give animals their medicines.
Farmers do this with sick animals like horses, cows and pigs.
We do this in the vet field a lot. People need to check with their vets before doing this with any medication.
I used to do this in my addiction. I’ve been clean from iv heroin for over 7 years now.
That looks like cu..
Im pretty sure they’re just stealing tips and tricks from heroin users 😂😂
Wouldn't this make it get absorbed in the blood stream quicker then designed, rather then slowly being dissolve in the stomach?, the same reason we are told to swallow pills and not chew them?
Splooj
Actually learned that in a chemistry class of mine in college
At first I thought this was semen...phew. always watch to the end...
Maybe not medical school but Physics 1 and 2 (you know that DEVIL in PRE-MED) definitely did. Pressure folks, it's all about pressure (a vacuum).
So your telling me I can drink my pills like this and not biting them and suffering thru horrific problems?
Drug addicts are like 👀👀👀
uHm-
To everyone arguing over who does more/who does what/who is most important in the health care system... here's the secret sauce: we all work together
I learned this from my vet? One of my kitties developed a serious URI a few weeks back, and I was instructed to administer one of her meds using this exact technique. …followed immediately with 6 ml of water.
*Emergency Meeting*
Now I gonna roofie you with toast
YouTube University
Yes because we should follow you for the other guy's good content?
Wel while shooting IV or IM or SC you dont want the germs from youre thumb into the solution. Stay safe use drugs!
They taught us this at film school (SFX Department).
Put it on a sandwich
good for people that have a feeding tube on multiple medications. But probably better to use gloves and filtered water to prevent bacterial contamination.
My mom is a CNP and she taught me this trick 26 years ago when my boys were little and couldn’t swallow meds
They didn’t teach y’all this because Junkies discovered it😂😂😂
At first I thought he was using it for IV medication 😅
so i'm the only one whos mind wasn't thinking anything medical after seeing this?
Now percocet addicts are gonna try it out and plug it up their arse.
Junkies know that.
Hey I saw a bunch of people doing this then going to sleep on the sidewalk I wonder what pill it was
😳😳😳😳
How to save a life by The Fray in the background though my guy
What’s this for?
Dude learned that from his step sister who was on dope, not med school.
No ones gonna talk about what the end looks like? Ok
What's The Benefits I Didn't Understand???
Mf really just made cum
Old nursing trick
I don’t understand what did he do?
Yes… becose its septic…. Finger on hole?
When my drug usung days were really bad this was how we prepared subutex and oxys before shooting them (been clean for 20months now)
Cap. Can’t convince me thats not jizz /j
I use a G-Tube, I can do this with anything I’ve already been approved to crush, right?
That's sad cuz my drug dealer taught me that 🤷
WOAH
Do that with an OxyContin I f ing dare you
Perc 30 niggas finna go crazy
😩so creamy
You just taught everyone here how to do a cold shake and shoot up dope congrats you fucking idiot.
I don’t understand the point of doing it 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ someone mind explaining pls
My dealer didn`t teach me neither.
Don’t do this. Some pills are timed release and if you take it like this you could over dose.
Dr Karan is such a daddy 😳
Every drug addict thanks you.
Prob works great with dog med too. No more hiding treats in cream cheese or peanut butter
Why?
As someone who can't swallow pills for the life of them, I'm gunnu have to try this out
Kids don’t do drugs
What in the meth ease is of hit is this 😂😬
Using street drugs did teach me this, *and* I have no student loan 😎
Well. I was cutting pull in 6 pieces to swallow. Or wirh capsules, opening and taking the powder . Why must they make pills size for horses anyway?
This is how the gave me 4mg of Ativan while I just was awake in the icu arching my back waiting for my neck to break !! Lil before that I was lucid but in able to control my body or noises I made. A nurse came by thinking I wouldn’t know grabbed my catheter and yanked !  I screamed and asked why she would ever do a such thing. That’s just one thing that happen to me while I was in the hospital for two months and 14 surgeries
That looks so easy, spent a yr giving my little dog her 3 meds thru a syringe 2x day for CHD, she died Dec2021 at 15yrs old💔 that looks quicker then shaking the syringe forever to get the pills to dissolve in the water..
Cool . But No No .
Too bad this principle doesn't work on calories in the vacuum I create inhaling food. 😜
This looks like it'd be perfect for giving pets medicine
Why not just take the big pill? It’s not hard…
Finally a reliable way to reproduce fake cum
What's with the random pepper?
Junkie's smashing that like button
We played around in lab at school doing this stuff
Humans stupidity has no limits
Creamy😫
Is it a new way to get high? Or just a way to scribble a design on your counter?
But that won't be sterile anymore :/
I'd say that depends on the drug you are using. Some work well, others won't.
It's faster to crush the medicine.
You'd need a hell of a lot of dope to fill that work ..that's def an OD
Wow that's amazing!  I really loved the bit where I didn't have a fucking clue what was going on.
In nursing we don't do this because you essentially contaminate the entire syringe when you plug with thumb. But then again who cares right, it's fast and easy
Ew, looks like cu-
Now I can easily spike drinks at the bar. Thanks!
And you contaminate the medication 🥱
No matter what we we breed, we are still made of seed, this is my kingdom come, THIS IS MY KINGDOM COME.

Jesus Christ loves you
How the bloody hell did he come up with this?
Drug addicts BEEN knowing this lmao
F O L L O W   F O R   M O R E
I’m 16… and know this is wrong😅 it’s a pill or tablet or whatever you’d like to call it your supposed to swallow it and let it dissolve slowly in your body talking it all in a small drink is going to do something I wouldn’t know what because I’ve never tried this
why is that song in the background? thats way too depressint for a video like this  maybe i just say that cause i associate it with that one scrubs scene where dr cox lost those 3 patients to rabies
Me, the dirty minded who kept looking suspiciously at the white milky substance shot out
so now I gotta easy way to take all my Xanax at once....thanks
The taught us in 6th grade
This is excellent advise, I wish I had known this for my sweet grandmother who sadly passed away 3 years ago aged 94 and whom I cared for more than 15 years. But now I know of how to better give my dog medicine ❤️🐾and I will definitely share this with friends with elderly parents/grandparents at home. Thank you 😊
What is it

Is he a special needs parent? this is one of our many tricks lol 😍
Doc I can't swallow anything not even a small Advil pill lol . I think I really need this the most.  Thanks🙏🏼
Ay yo
Ayo u sure that’s a pill
Ayo😏
they didn’t teach this because most pills aren’t meant for breaking
I have a g tube kid so I learned this out of necessity
But what the point? Is someone gonna snort or shoot this or is this? Or is tops in place of swallowing a big pill? I’m confused
Its supposed to dissolve while its in your body🤦🏾‍♂️
U can also just turn it around so the tip points down then let off ur finger, the air rushing in will do the same in just 1 go   I mean i never tried it with pills but with other hard to mix stuff
Dope head trick

Cool
Ayooo🤨
Nigga just gave someone a new tactic to poison me. Smh. 😔
You don't teach this crap to junkies.
Why follow you for more your a doctor and didn't even k ow this trick lol jk i already follow you

…. Could have been useful for my mom 3 months ago. 😔
This is really useful for my dog's meds!

It doesn't Work with every syringe!
Wait wait...this would be great for giving animals pills! My cat refuses pills, spits them back up or I just feel bad trying to give them to her. She handles liquids a lot easier. This is great!
Thats sus
Boy got a pepper by the syringe what spicy shit was about to happen😭😭

I really dislike swallowing pills does this really work?
For some reason i can’t swallow pills so thnx 😂😭
OK but why though
Just swallow the pill
Sooo creamyyy🥛😏
We did this when we had to drug our cats for 4 days of cross country travel. It was a small pill so after I liquefied it I added it to a little meat gravy meant for cats and they drank it right up rather than having to shove it down their throats and get my shoes pooped in 🤣
Or just swallow the pill
My mums been doing this for years now , she works in health …
Wonder if you could do this with xans and shoot it under your tongue. They’re not supposed to be water soluble tho
Coom
Ayo am i the only one who is thinking wrong?
It tastes nasty doe
We did this when I was a Needle junkie years ago Jesus saved me ,it's called power washing but I would put cotton in tip first then crush pill an push it takes out buffer to inject so glad I m done with that life
Kewl, now I can make oxy paste
Get some original content
I’m going to try this with my norcos
ahem, ahem...... not JUST heroin users. 😉🤓
That's basic common sense.
Not a medical student, so idk, but I’m confused as to why this is necessary. Aren’t pills made so that they can be delivered directly to the stomach without possibly being broken down by unwanted sources while it is being delivered to the stomach? Doesn’t making it a liquid defeat the purpose?
Oh my god! I wish I had known this for all of my tube fed patients
Sucralafate?
humans have reached AI levels of pointless
pill poppers tryin to start a trend
Me when ur mom:
They didn’t teach this in pharmacy tech either
What’s this for?
I used to do this with some of my sons medication that came in tablet form, can't remember who showed me but it was really handy
I didn't know this was a thing until a fellow nurse taught it to me.  The difference where I work though, is we use a purple syringe to distinguish tube or oral medications versus IV (the doctor is using a regular IV syringe) so as not to accidentally inject something orally taken.
yea i can’t swallow big pills so this is great
Whats the use of this
What is that a pepper seed
I hope it doesn't have to do with drugs!! Lol
Wth??! Lol! Ya lost me sweetheart. Lmao!
Ready for IV😃
Yoo🤨📸
Wow I've been shooting my meth the hard way everytime! Thanks for the tip!
My mom, a drug addict, would do this with pills cuz I couldn’t swallow them as a kid :) just fun facts. Now I just take the pills w a bite of food but if it works it works
This is amazing
Just remember kids this pro tip is for experienced boofers only!
That looks wrong the color
Cool👌
What kids do.
Okay
Yo that's looks like                       Cake icing 🎂
I guess that he write "PARACETAMOL"
If you know this, you either do drugs or have a friend who does
I can get that liquid without using a syringe
you shouldn’t do this with some pills because some pills are made to desolve farther into your system.
Why tho
Great thing to know if I wanna know how to inject blue m30s
My aunt who is a semi retired old school phlebotomist says there are so many things they dont teach anymore. And some things you simply have to learn from people who came before you anyway.
My dad told me about this and also showed me once
Dirty mind
yeah but then you get the taste of the pill because its already dissolved in your mouth. no one wants that taste
2 Corinthians 12:9-10 King James Version 9 And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. 10 Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.
😲WHY WASN'T THIS COMMON KNOWLEDGE when we were raising our 5 kids?!?!??
Dont say it! Im not gonna say it!         Cum.
This is actually helpful I have a 7yr old autistic son who won't swallow pills so we have to crush them an put them into a drink well the lil stinker caught on to the sound of the pill crusher an now when he sees it or hears it he's gone in 60 seconds an it's a battle to the death to get him to take his medicine an let's just say Mommy loses more than he does lol. But definitely gonna talk to his pediatrician about if it's ok to do this to his medicine cause none of the pills are capsules or coated. Maybe a YouTube short will end my nightly battle of giving my autistic son his medicine I've even went as far as hiding it in his snacks like he's a puppy 😂💀🤣

Ah, very interes- AYO
I see lots of comments saying to ask your doctor if your medication can be dissolved like this, and while I agree that a doctor is a great resource, an even more accessible resource is your pharmacist!! Just walk in to your usual pharmacy and ask or call if you can’t come in! Any pharmacist would be more than happy to help you :)
Que vergas es esto ?
This shit hurts when it hits your fingers lol. Idk how so many people can do it constantly
You got to make sure you're doing it with the right medication though, if not you can get seriously hurt, and even OD
Hmm

This is an AWESOME hack.. Thank you!!!
Second one was already mush before the hits
Can’t you just dissolve it in a cup?
Works with K4 Dliaudids also. Or use too in my use too days…

Is it just me or did the pill already looked crushed when he recreated it,
He wrote his signature at the end
Thats why its called a medical practice
Wow this is awesome for my sons gtube meds. Tried it an it works beautifully!!!
😳
This big pill is paracetamol, and yes, it dissolves easily 🤦🏻
I was taught this we call it a slurry.
Where did yall learn this from? Crackology? Shooting up 101?
that would taste awful

I was gonna leave a comment on how stupid this is because of medicine that releases over time and doctor man here should have put that in the video.   But no, he made a pinned comment and made me look like a jackass.
Don’t reach for the chili, or the pineapple, make sure you grab the syringe.
These guys are definitely booty bumpin

The FitnessGram™ Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. [beep] A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. [ding] Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, start.

Omg I was on a med that I had to dissolve in water for a personalized dose and I spent half my life shaking that pill in the little beaker of distilled water and I could have done this!
Ayo sussy 😏
Haha cu-
Okay but seriously can we just take a minute and appreciate how cute first man is??
I dont think that's medicine.
Well hell! Im glad i saw this! My 13 year old kitty Roxy is on medicine for her thyroid. She gets a pill every morning. I soak in water then suck it up. This will be so much easier!!!
I tried doing this to give my daughter allergy medicine bc they wrote her tablets instead of liquid and I could not get it to work lol
Yey more way to take pills that are unnecessary...  Doctors ruined my life with medications..
I’m lmao “medical school didn’t teach me this” bitch doctors don’t have to crush or give meds 😩

Doesn’t the pill need to break down inside your body and not your mouth tho?
Oh cool I will try this with a fentanyl 👍🏼
But what's the purpose?
AYYY, that looks like my sock after 3AM
Mom's we know this!💕💕🙈
God loves you♥️♥️
does that not look dirty to anyone else
I bet it doesn’t taste good at all 😂😂 but if you want I can make your whole months supply in 10-15 min and it won’t taste horrible, it’s called compounding medications😂😂😂 the proper way to make medications 🤷🏻‍♂️
PAUSE
I do this all the time except without a pill it’s just cool to do smack it against stuff
Sus
What nobody tells you is that it hurts your thumb when you release the plunger
Whoa sus liquid
that don’t look right:
Exactly! Never dissolve your medication without confirming it’s ok. Ask your doc or a pharmacist. Preferably a pharmacist.
This short just made my day 🏆❤️
Wow I can boof my blood pressure meds
God i miss him..
That looks like…nvm
Perk hit faster now

Don't do this for Sildenafil.  Its hard.

someone give me a like pls to save the video
Breaking up spores teaches you that 🤣🤣
I wish I knew this when my beloved cat Fiesta was alive. She hated her pills and I was able to dissolve them.
If you declare with your mouth, Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the deadyou will be saved Romans 10:9 Please Repent And accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Saviour Rapture and Hell is the consequence please.😭

Hmm it looks like c'm
🤔I dnt get it
I know how I'm taking my next perc
What pills can you use it for?
How am I supposed to snort it if it gets all wet ?
Yes! A lot of nurses don’t know this either, and we’re the ones actually giving the meds. I just learned this a few months ago, I’ve tried it and it definitely works. And for all you non medical people commenting about injections and such, it’s just to break down the pill, then you give via a feeding tube, you DO NOT inject it. Some pills crush easier than others, and our hospital only supplies really crappy pill crushers that you have to twist, this method is actually much easier…and of course, never crush any extended release or enteric coated tablets, they DID teach us that in nursing school….
What is that?
Sus
I thought it dissolved the pill at first and was calling bullshit. Then I realized it was crushing the pill.
Didn't no one think about the sussy sauce
Don’t do this bc some pills are made to slowly let you absorb what it has a packed powder pill will slowly dissolve outside in instead of crushed up where it will all be absorbed all at once and others have outer coatings like pain killers will have a rubber like outside (idk what) some are made to be absorbed fast like capsules where the moment the capsule is gone it will disperse and be absorbed (I am not a doctor so do not take anything I just said as fact this is mostly theory and common sense)
Because the vacuum requires things to spread out so the pill breaks (this what happens if dont have astronaut suit)
Sus
Me on December first
Whats the goal ?
🙄🙄
Thanks. Now I can inject my OxyContin 👍
I did this with adderall
THIS IS FOR FEEDING TUBES NOT GENERAL DIGESTION
Used to do this when giving my dog medicine because he wouldn't swallow pills
I just normally crush them and snort them,seems like the new trend.
"It's not a mistake",✨ITS A MASTERPICE✨
Can confirm, have used this method for abusing pills using plugging as the ROA. Not proud of my past just adding my experience.
This is awsome my mom is dying of glioblastoma multiforme .... So taking pills is just now getting difficult even with the liquid option she's trying to be strong and still take the pills so thank u sincerely from a caregiver daughter and her Mom
Drug addict started this when doing oxycontin so they could shoot It up. Facts.
Cream!! 😩😩😩
Then what? Are you actually going to have someone eat that?!? 😝
They didn't teach this to me in veterinary school either
I had to watch my cousin who has a gtube, for almost 2 yrs. I didnt go to medical school but somethings just seem like common sense, idk. You have to make sure the pill is disolved in his situations so i learned to do this
But there are some pills that can be dangerous if you dissolve them before it gets to the stomach. Like the ones that can cause ulcers
Yeah take that to the bank junkie and addicts stupid advice to put on YouTube
Um that’s unsanitary
Thas kinda sus
I like powder more
This is great for junkies
Or you could just swallow it like a normal person and take it as intended lol. Now I have used this trick on pets because they are incredibly hard to get to swallow pills.
Good job but whot the hell is it
Which hole do you inject it in though??

Really?!?! After years of crushing pills for horses to administer orally by syringe, I could have used this trick years ago and will be using this….today.
Xannies ?
Kinda sus
Yea youtube is different . On tik tik usually I would see weird ah comments and stuf but I don’t see a single one here
You mean I could of been doing it this way instead of forcing a giant pill down my poor cats throat all this time?!?
Bro is that the seamen demon himself
Wow
i can think this could be useful for a child who refuses to swallow the pill or for your stubborn dog. seems neat
Okie, please chill ppl, I’m pretty sure this is meant for oral consumption…not intravenous. I hope 😅
what’s in the tube
Isnt that the guy Stephen crowder owned
There's an easier way to do this with out the solid thing guys. *unzips pants*

Creamy
Pharmacist in training here! Not all tablets should be crushed and mixed with water or a solution!! Some are specifically designed to be swallowed whole and slowly disintegrate & release the active drug as it moves down the GI tract!
Fuck my brain hurts are this many people to stupid to analyze the video and see that the ducking 🦆 pill is pre crushed before he does this so called “trick” wtf kinda world do I be living in everyone this retarded?
Can we just appreciate that these shorts save everyone’s boredom everyday 💚
Pill is predissolved and crushed look at the video peeps
🤨
I do this for puppies and kittens that need meds
Please dirty minded people don't comment
What is the purpose of doing this??? Isn't it way easier just to swallow it
O hell nah I’m not drinking pill-semen
By the time you’re done with that I’ll have all of my patient’s meds crushed and mixed in with some water already?
I can understand the practical use, but if they wanted the pill as a liquid, it probably would've come as a liquid. The reason it's a pill, is because your stomachs acidity it to break it down. Digesting it as a liquid may seem as effective, but doing this or making it into a powder makes it stick in globs around your digestive track, making the medicine inefficient and noneffective. Practical yes, effective, maybe not.  Edit: this is the reason they don't tell you to do this, as I see some of the comments saying they haven't been told, is just general practice over ethics, it's like checking an ID before giving someone alcohol. You don't need to tell them, but for the good of the person your giving the medicine to, is safer.
Very neat to know
What is the point of doing that
I'm lost still. What is this for?
That looks so wrong
I learned this back in 7th grade science lol
this is cool!    ⚠️ It's not a mistake, it's a TRAGEDY. ☣️ #NoMoreBean
Great!! 👍🏼 But can it be done with any pill?
What's this useful for? So confused
I can already taste it 🤢
This is cool and all but medical school did NOT need to teach us this lol. We don’t even give meds nurses do. I think we were too busy learning how to properly cut open a body or diagnosis an illness
Why would you do this......
… i cant be the only one.
Is jus funny how the pepper just there righ next to the syringe 😂
So creamyyy
School doesn't  teach you everything fact.
A nursing student taught me this when I was a clinical professor. I definitely passed it on!
They probably didn't teach this in medical school because this is pill addict 101. I've been a recovering addict for 6 years but that's what we call a cold shake.
Me when… when me… when you… when I… your mom when… when your…
They diddnt teach this in veterinary school either x
I can see how that would be helpful especially with like a dog or cat
damn that's a lot of white stuff
Thanks mate. Making morphine easier to cook :)
Dont ask reddit what it is
My vet showed me this for when my rabbit had to eat pills!
Damn this man's nails are cleaaaaan ✨
Why?
Useful for NGT feeding
They didn’t teach me this in writing school either! Though, I have no idea why they would have.
Yo why… why do it look like that?
Nah this infers from pressure of the air. We know it ourselves after physics classes

Hey guys welcome back to how to get high
What’s the point of doing that?
You have to let it dissolve a while
I’m a RN and I learned this from a home health LVN a few years ago
But why..and is that the yellow school bus perk
I could only imagine this would be best gor the fast acting meds, chalk like meds (typically steroid), vet meds or childrens medication that cannot be liquid
Damn, I thought this was a sperm prank. Thank God for the smart people in the comments.
How you get fired as a nurse
This is stupid
I literally thought dude had cum in the first tube 🤷🏿‍♂️

They don’t teach you that because it’s unhygienic
This will be great for our oxy addicts
I’m not a doctor or anything lol but I think it’s probably best to not mess with your meds
U want to take some pills whole , crushing certain medications can kill u
what this is?

Don't say it Don't you say it
That liquid looks a little sus 😳😳😳😳😳🥶🍦
I only hate they taught this publicly because some people finna use this for the wrong reason
The guy just copied it and reposted it oh yea and said follow for more lmao
Its WATER or SALINE?
This is bad for ANY addict though. And make sure your dogs won’t have reactions to medications. this method can altar their medications potency!
Finally, fake nut
This could be useful for animals too
People are talking about injection, but I'm thinking it's more for swallowing as a liquid for patients that can't swallow a large pill.
Ok... but what about capsules 💊?
could be a great way to give medicine to ur pets. My cats hates to swallow pills unless I shove it into his throat. I'll ask my pet vet if that would be an alternative
It's just a demo doc, you didn't need to sign a whole prescription on your countertop lol
GachiGASM CUM PILL?
This is what I do with my cats.
Not even in pharmacy tech did they teach us this!!! Wow
Why is this necessary in life....smh
What’s that white stuff
Ask any junky they all know
Literally doing this in eighth grade science but with spinach leafs
Makes sense. Taking advantage of pressure differencees
What would happen if you did this with Adderall 💀
this isn’t safe for some pills coz their meant to be digested slowly and if it’s all at once it can be bad
Looks like…
It’s not a mistake ✨IT’S A MASTERPIECE✨
Medical school didn't teach u this because doctors don't give medication...nurses do
When you pull the plunger down while covering the opening you create negative pressure inside of the syringe which in turn pulls the air out of the pill and the water gets forced in when pressure is equalized inside the syringe.
Jizzill
What is it??
Thanks Robert Patterson
Be careful guys some pills are made to release at specific times after being in the body if you do this to some then you’ll never get the pull effect
White stuff
Wow would have liked to know this when I was an opiate addict
This is great information for pet owners as well......I've always just set it somewhere to dissolve,,,,mostly used for equines....
Great for first time hitmans
Damn.  They didn’t teach us that in nursing school either.
Soooo glad I saw this!!!
This would have saved me a lot of trouble after my gastric bypass surgery.
Y’all know what it looks like

I wouldn't dare do this to my medication and take it I take my medication as prescribed I wouldn't recommend guys
It hurts your thumb, why isn't anyone mentioning this painful fact.
Sperm bank:where did the pill go
SUS DOCTA.
So what exactly is the purpose of doing this?? Genuinely curious.
And how do you use that?
This is just creating a low pressure container forcing the solid to expand into liquid right?
WHO KNEW?!

Yuck...the taste of so many medicines! Bleck. I would NOT recommend this for suppositories..that may ummm..*backfire*
I don’t remember why but I had to take these literal horse pills I WISH I knew this earlier!
This is mint for shoving Percocet, course your vein is clogged with pill base and acetaminophen but hey beats being sick and waiting for the fucker to get through the digestive system
I have been doing this for over 40 years. I was shown this by my old Professor... So handy when you have kids, teens, adults and seniors that cannot swallow pills...seems this method is global...yay!!
As he pushes the plunger up to "get rid of the air" you can clearly see that the pill is inside a small, transparent plastic container.
Watch Dr. Michael Klaper "What I wish I learned in medical school". Has nothing to do with syringes, but a lot to do with preventing the vast majority of disease!
Some dumb guy will inject his penis …. Guaranteeeeee…. 🤣🤣🤣🤣💉
Why are doctors reacting like they ever needed to push a PO med through a g-tube
Me joking around: SO CREAMY UGGHHH 😫 Nurses and doctors: THIS HACK IS SO HELPFUL
That doesn’t look like medicine I’msorry
School didn’t teach you that. A nurse did. Lol
This is what is known as the water hammer effect. When there is an excess I'm out of water or a vacuum the force of the water is directly related in ratio to how much water is moving. This is the primary reason why public water pipe burst because of a gap that becomes a vacuum in the water pipe. All that water suddenly moves to fill in that space and that Force has to go someplace.
Why would a md give a fuck all about this trick. They havent touched a po med in hospital in their entire career
This is how I had to give my dog medicine bc she avoided pills
I sure hope you are doing that with gloves at yhe job site.
What’s the go with the sad 😢 background music wtf 🤬
Ayo my guy that looks pretty sus
Thanks, definitely I can use this hack while giving med to my dog
True dope heads only know this.
Did not need to show it like that...
This would ha e been so useful 2 weeks ago. My dog was taking 3 different pills and since he can't move his jaw I gave them to him diluded in a syringe
This would have been nice to have known a year ago!  I had to give my infant daughter some meds, but they only came in pill form.  I tried everything the doctor said: from crushing them up and mixing them in her bottle (which the medicine stayed clumped in the nipple) to just crushing it and putting it directly on her tongue between swallows to dipping her pacifier into the powder over and over again!  I wish her doctor knew this, cause that is so helpful!
Does this work for OxyContin or ER Oxycodone? Asking for a friend of a friend :)
ayo pause
How are you supposed to snort it when it's all wet though? 😭😭
We see it, but we won’t say it.
Wait Dad, why does the mustard taste weird?
We do this in our vet clinic!
We’ll I just found a new awesome way to take Xanax
That’s not medicine
This is my kingdom come this is my kingdom come
Great for pluggin 😂
Thanks I'ma shoot up my percs now
So he copied a video, then you copied his video. Damn I'm impressed
My GNC Creatine pills come out whole when I go to the bathroom. Is this a good alternative?
FOLLOW FOR MORE
So apparently yall don't have eyes, if you look closely at the doctors syringe the medicine is already crushed up (look when he pushes the extra water out)
Nut 🥜
Theres a reason why you can buy meds in different forms. Don't change how its made. You're not a f*cking pharmacist. This is only applicable if you have a feeding tube down your throat at its headed to your stomach.
Figured this out while giving meds to my dog, real time saver, though if you don't do it right a bit of the solids can plug up the tip & sneeze the meds out like a shotgun
Yeah i learned that during my internship at obgy
That looks so sus😩
Yo that looks low key looks like… 👀
How to do Heroin from Oxy
Why does it look like that😭😂
Junkies have been doing this for a while
Im about to try this with a perc
They didn't teach us this in retail either.
Jesus loves you
Here's a fancy way to take our ducked synthetic drugs - medical system has been corrupted.
Don’t do this lol
What did you wrote there?
Science! The pressure causes it to desolve
coom
😳
They didn't teach us this in medical school but they again I dropped out 🤣
Are you saying this is where cum comes from ? 😱
This video just made me realize my mind is terribly dirty
I yeah imma shoot up some percs
I wish I had known this back when I had my dog
So why pay for school 🤦🏻‍♂️
It is not a joke it is a hazard
that looks like.....
What's the story of the pepper
Lmao every junkie ever
Thank you so much for this hack! I have so much trouble taking my meds and fear I will choke, this is so much better!
I wonder if this works with needles🤔
Well They did not because you just can’t do this to some of the tablets that needs to be coated and slow release
Pharmacists know about this and they were taught it in school. But sadly we're not seen in the same light as doctors and nurses even though we probably know more about medications
We do this in veterinary medicine for pets who won’t take a pill and we can’t get the liquid form
I’ve been cursed with colostomy and ileostomy bags before and this would’ve been great for some medications and supplements. I can’t tell you how many times I’d clean my bags to find half a tablet undigested.
Great for children!
I should call her...
A nursing student taught me this when I was a clinical professor. I definitely passed it on!
Vacuum makes much easier to dissolve
We IV’ing percs😈
Hey dummy! Its in pill form because its not supposed to be digested in your stomach! Its supposed to be digested in your intestines!
Somebody catch me up. What's going on here?
Can only take your medication in jizz form ?
Don't do this, alot of pills are supposed to dissolve in your body
Wow!
I like how "smart" doctors go full retard when it comes to writing their name legibly. Almost like they aren't confident with their practice to say, "yes, I signed off on that. I take pride in what I do, you can trust me." They just use chicken scratch so fewer people can know who fucked up.
Now I'ma mix my Percocet
They don't teach it in med school because it's a common technique used by junkies to shoot up pills, probably not a smart thing to teach people how to do this, imagine how many young men will watch this, try it and OD because they watched YOU show them how. You should think before you post. At minimum did you atleast make this video not suitable for kids?
It's not a mistake ✨ its a masterpiece ✨
Its okeh not to be okeh  (Titan cry)
SuS
Sometimes it stings when it snaps back though lol
But, why?!
That’s a lot of H. Be careful. 🤣
I can’t tell if this is a troll video or something actually useful
Cvm
So would you say you’re more of a cleric or a ranger? Or a little of both like a hybrid, I’m looking for another PC to join my party.
What's the point of this?
Smoke DMT and experience the truth
Me when ur mom
😩😩😩😩😩 krispy cream glaze
I chew my pills 😬💊💊
I’m Dr. Medina I’ve been practicing medicine for 7 years. This is not recommended due to the fact that the medication does not fully dissolve leaving large doses of residue causing complications on certain patients. Meaning in rare cases this can cause the body to create more enzymes to break down the small Medication particles and raising the blood pressure. Also I just wasted your time because I have no idea of what I am talking about I am no trained professional, but I hope you have a nice day.
I’m sure it has to do with the solubility under vacuum
This is how I give my son paracetamol pill if u have ran out of liquid one
It works! I used this to get antibiotic pills down my dog's throat
I just tried it. I'm floored! Wow
And now I have a doctor's signature 😂😂
ZMM on the ASX. 99% down. Outstanding investment for this year?
RAN on the ASX. 99% down. Outstanding investment for this year?
Work with norcos?
I don't know about you. But I can't snort that in that form with out feeling like I'm drowning. 😂
Is that a perc
Some crack shit 😂😭😭
the percs aren't safe now.
I am an in home caregiver for the elderly. And this is an amazing life hack for hospice patients and patients with trouble swallowing! Thank you!❤️
WTF THIS CHANGED MY LIFE
I- thought nvm imma leave this here
Wow
White sticky liquid 😫😫😫
They didn’t teach me this in law school either.
Jeeyuz
Why would I follow you for someone else’s video
Doesn't work with enteric coated meds.
A junky trick🙄🤦‍♂️
Somebody gonna OD on some slow release capsules after watching this😂
This should be deleted. There are enough idiots who abuse/dying of overdoses l, which is continuously detrimental to individuals who actually need certain meds. Plus? You never know who is watching.
Wake up babe, new MDMA lore
(Wipes sweat away from forehead) dam
This is how I give my dog their meds in their food. If I can’t get them to take it like they normally do. The vet said it was a good idea as long as they get it all. They’re good at taking the pill 💊 but sometimes say fuck your pill 😂
Well I mean that’s just simple physics
this is for the people who can’t swallow pills- like me 🤪
na thanks bro i don't need that
Thanks I'll remember this so I can take all drugs intravenously. Finally I can inject 3 whole marijuanas.
Well OD times just reduced by 5min
STOP!!! I'll be so real guys we need to give our lives to God  we need to make an effort to get close to him😔. The is short and He's Calling. We need to try our best to not be in the world, not sin etc. Ik it's hard cuz I'm struggling too. But my you be guided by the Holy spirit IJN. Jesus loves you, honesty he does, so change your ways now🙏🏾💙
🤨
Never do this with antidepressants or extended release medications
Creamy
No Thank i'm good
So what tho?!
I'm wondering what is that on the counter
It didn't work when I tried it?
Why would they teach you how to give a pill in medical school. (This is nursing school) haha
No no no dope isers.. no big ideas ok..
I had a G Tube in my stomach while on life support when I woke up that's how I got vitamins and basically ensure to live. But this is another level
Ayo!???
Ummm ok now what? 🤷🏾‍♀️🤔
👀👀
Contaminating with finger tips
As a person that can’t swallow pills, I find this very helpful
One of the reasons medications are taken in pill form is to have a release over time. Will this be dangerous with some medications? This will absorb much faster.
Called cold shaking
Special needs parents been doing this for years :) (or at least once another special needs parent taught me!)
This is very helpful for assisting disabled clients in being med compliant.
I've done this many a times and I can tell you the individual did it wrong inside this video
even i knew it even tho im not a medical student
Pills are usually meant to be swallowed whole
Drug addicts known about this forever.
But remember some pills such as enteric coated can't be given like this. The coating is made to allow the pill to dissolve slowly to make it past the stomach, where it dissolves and is absorbsed in the small intestine. I am a CCMA and when administering enteric coated medications I have to make sure the patient knows not chew or crush the pill.
Ayo
Why would you want to break a pill down like this 🤢🤮🤮
i tried this and the syringe broke
CREAM!!!!!
Que sentido tiene? Que necesidad de hacerlo? Osea es como decir waaao el azúcar se disuelve con agua, waaao :v
We aren’t going to talk a out what it looks like 😩😳
Nice reaction
As a person with a surgical feeding tube on so many medications I’ve tried this in every single kind and can’t get it to work!
I just have 1 question…”for why?”
That was pretty Sus eh 🤨📸
If that is carafate it totally doesn’t count.  But I’m going to try this
sus
sus.
There’s a lot that medical school doesn’t teach you, including how to care for patients with dark skin. Very weird!
Insert *DEMONS* by Imagine dragons
Big pill and two seseme seeds?
We use this to give tranquilizers to horses. Works in seconds
the end looks like...something
The chili 🌶 tho
Pretty cool for the humongous pills that we have to swallow.
SUS CREAM
Wait, I don't get it! 🥲🤦🏻‍♂️
how to fake coomshots📝✍🏾
Ok fake doc
Oh oh oh....i needed this. I was dreading 😫 taking my horses today. Takes all of 5 minutes to swallow.
They didn’t teach us this in nursing school either!
I just want to I hate my mind ! 🥲
Coom
Now do it with the chilli pepper on the window sill 🤣
What can this be used for?
that's bad not to teach us in medical school,we might not know stuffs 🤨
Say, that looks an awful lot like—
But why?!!
Is that potassium or a regular tab
Why do u need to write in drugs on the counter, couldn't I just use a sharpie?
There is two problems here, some meds taste awful once they dissolve and that alone can make someone gag even worse. Then further more if its an extended release or something like that then this could be dangerous in some cases.
I did that all the time with just plain water and knew NOTHING about med school. It seemed as if I knew it would be predictable.
The only thing I learned from this is that chasing cars was playing in the background …
Yall ever take the air out of yalls mouth when Dippin oreos in milk?
And thats how ppl shoot up w drugs
Im so dirty minded
Ayo
Doctors need that for their anal medications
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come...
If they didn't teach this in medical school or a nursing school, they might have taught it in pharmacy school lol
Ouhhhh reminds me of something..the question is can I taste it??
When would this be appropriate to use then?
Sus
... cause MD's administer PO meds 🤣
Do this with 10 tablets and a 60 mL syringe?!?
I know me and you was thinking of the same thing  that’s why we friends
(Laughs in pill addict) hahahaha
Great for boofing drugs
This is bs! Coming from someone that’s tube fed!
"This is my kingdom come this is my kingdom come"
This is a good idea when u have to give dog/cats pills
What's the significance of it
This is beneficial for me. I can't swallow pills. 🤣
Kinda sus
People I know smoke it on foil or snort it or shove it up their butt.  No me though
😈
Clarify that you can do this with your doctor first! A lot of medicines won't work if you do that!
This is my Kingdom come this is my kin- ohhh uhhh
This is how I take my Molly now guys
Some pills cannot be digested mixed into water like that so please don't do this unless a doctor says its alright-
Mind in the gutter
Generally junkies learn this extreamly quick xD
I have done this before
THIS IS SO HELPFUL FOR MY ANIMALS! They're never fooled by hiding it in food or treats 🤣
You can over dose from this some pills have a clear coat over they for reasons this is not good to do.
But why so its easier to chew or?
Isn't there a point to it being a pill though? Like slower release? And couldn't some pills be too harsh for the esophagus?
How have I been a nurse for 30 years and not know this?!?! 🤦‍♀️
U just saved 3 minutes of a junkie's life.
Thank you! I take Lysine when I get cold sores and even when I break them in half, I end up choking.
They didn’t teach me this in business school!
My thumb hurts like heck now
Why would you ever need to do this?
Sus
