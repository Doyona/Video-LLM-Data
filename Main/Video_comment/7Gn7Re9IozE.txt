Why did he eat him if he didn't like to eat ants? a mean i know he's an ANTEATER but then why did he have a full plate of cookies in front of him?
😂
He hated ant's but he loves to eat ant's that's why he eats them
fun fact: ant eaters don't have teeth
Why the heck did youtube recommend me a 3 year old video
The ant was so polite about being eaten…😅
The ant was so polite about being eaten…😅

Bryson!!! I am huge big fan i watch every single videos your post i don't have enough money to buy your toys
Is this real?
I was half expecting the ant to answer like “yeah I getchu, I really don’t like sugar…this is just to get my parents off my back” or something
Actually, I have a question odd ones out why does the ant eater look like it? Extinct creature? I’m serious. It looks like one.
Add eater he❤❤❤❤😊
ya gotta admit, with species that are normally rivals, they had some pretty good bonding either that or the ant agreed with everything the anteater said to keep himself alive
Says they don’t like ants and proceeds to eat one
"issat right?"   the way he said it was so sweet
Not true false alarm
what a quiet and distracting catch
Why can’t Americans be this polite to their adversaries? I do mean amongst other Americans. We could learn much from this cartoon.  RIP ANThony.
It's actually sad that you don't eat ants,even tho you are an anteater😂😂😂
Martin eater just look at me
HE ATE THE ANT
Anteater can only eat small eatable objects like ants because there mouth is so small
https://youtu.be/raTkZqz680Y?si=tmM15U1pT881z27U
That was a very unfortunANT situation 😂😂
Its not just ants they eat they'll eat any kinda small insect like termites
I don't understand what is happening
The ant was about to die any way, as a male, they die after mating and that male ant is outside the nest (which means it’s mating season) so the ant eater just sped up the process.
That one South way too fast
rare photo of an ant giving an anteater therapy
i don't no but the ant let' the anteater eat it'
THAT'S NOT THE ANT'S MOUTH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"I'm sorry about this" "I understand" *Yoink*
I find this really wholesome gor some reason
not funny
He was a “bullet” ant
This was a day after my birthday😂🎉😂🎉😂🎉🎉😂🎉😂🎉😂🎉😂🎉
fun fact : did you know ants can lift 50x their weight so when someone says "you are as weak as an ant" you can reply with a thank you
Poor anteaters
Why is this reminding me of shark tale
English isn't my native language and when I thinking "oh that's cool who's made dub " I'm understand

"It's allright man"
The ant thinking: “At least he’s apologizing for it”
Darwin once said: KISS!

Imagine sometime in the future, scientists end up finding out that most anteaters actually dislike ants but actauuly eat them due to their digestive system.

I do not think you need this piece of information but my robot is watching but bruh he is going insane
Bro accepted his death...
“Is that right”
I misread the title for "A theater"
The anteater was the only friend the ant has had in his life, so it was a privilege from him to be one with his best friend.
Just call yourself an ardvark then,they're basically the same thing
🎉
That ant deserves an award for being the best ant ever… or DESERVED an award 😂

Even tho its polite bro said how to eat ants without them fighting you step one act like you hate ants step 2 they feel sorry step 3 eat them
NGL i expected him to either let the ant leave or for them to become friends or something as a *don't let labels define you* bit kek
Bro this is so sad
“You seem a decent man, I hate to kill you.” “You seem a decent fellow, I’d hate to die.”
I understand first of all get your old name don’t do the labels like ant eater in this case second of all for the people who do the labels so it’s for you this is for youAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
What an uncommon yet compelling take on how societies labels cause us to act in a way that fits said stereotypes. Sad
You are NOT Aardvark vs Ant💀
he was so polite...
Bro why
Plot twist: the ant has a uno reverse in his pocket
Cute ant

That's funny. I literally just went to the zoo, and there was an Anteater
I don’t think juicy gets paid enough to do this
They mostly eat termites
Jesus loves y’all man fr  Repent and go to Him  Romans 10:9-10 “ If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved.”

5:50 IT'S THE CATS FROM THE GAME "STRAY"
I identify as basketball 🏀
Labels man😭
Lmao is this a coming out?
I UNDERSTAND 😢
Personally I find the Brazilian name way more interesting for "Anteater". We call them "Tamanduá", means "Ant Hunter" in a native language.
I eat ants
I sacrifice two of my back row cards in order to special summon my anteater-eating ant
What I think is going to happen if I let my gaurd down:
Anophthalmus hitleri be like: 👀
Most characters before death: Screaming or "NOOOOO!"  This Ant: I understand.
And in the end he caved and conformed to society, eating his friend anyway. 😭
You are you you are you so you don't have to do what people tell you you do because you are special lake treasure on the ocean so you shouldn't think that you have to like
If you don't like eating ants why did you leave him at the end literally like if you if you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you
I thought the title said "ant-theater"💀
The greatest lesson I was ever taught was to " Pay attention to people's actions not their words."
Ant Cuck 😮
NOOOO THE ANT😭😭😭😭😭😭
Why do anteaters eat ants , because they are “ant eaters”😂😂😂
"I don't like eating ants... but I can't eat my cookies while there's still food on the table." "I understand."
Poor guy
[trying to sob his way out of being eaten]  Its true, its true! And the other thing is, my sister had a baby and I took it over after she passed away and the baby lost all its legs and arms and now its just a stump but I take care of it with my wife and... and its growing and its fairly happy... and its difficult because I'm working a second shift at the factory to put food on the table but all the love that I see in that little guy's face it makes it worth it in the end. True story.
Well, if he doesn't like eating "ants." Why doesn't he try eating my dad's sister? She's an ant.
This ant is my new favorite character 😅😂
He understands.

At least you don't eat seals
Sorry for calling you stupid
Bro he did not care that he was going to die
😂😂😂😂😂
They can eat termites as an alternative
Oh did everyone watched ant and the aardvark is show like from pink panther
The animal is not called an anteater because others place labels on it. It's because the animal eats ants.
I FINALLY GOT THE JOKE. “I understANT”
“I understan- AHH IT HURTS! KILL ME QUICKLY DAM IT!! OH THE SUFFERING-“  “Gosh, those ants are so loud. That’s why I don’t like eating them.”
The sneaky anteater fooled the ant.
Labels man sorry ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhuuhhuuuuahahahahah
Wtf? Is that true?? Why is he called that then!
He never said he doesn't like eating ants, he just said he doesn't like ants. There's the possibility that he hates ants and that's why he ate the ant.
Vote for anteaters!  Better than aardvarks
Jokes aside, I love this metaphor
Imagine not liking ants but your evolved to eat them
what a wonderful vore short
Actually animation is more a Aardvark than Anteater..
He must be canadian
Won’t the llama die eventually by being hit to much by snowballs
He ate him instead of eating the cookies 😅
Okay not to be rude or anything funny at times James but I don't get the joke the joke kind of flew over my head living in the comments what it is
This is how my parents marriage is
That ant is being so empathetic
How come anteaters don’t get hurt when they try to eat and why is the spider not called a bug eater?🤔🤔
The ending was an absolute plot twist !!
It ate him anyway
"Is zat right?" Rip Antony the ant
The way he says “Izzat right?” is so adorable to me for some reason.
The ant was too nice. Now I feel bad. 😢
Bro I think he new what he new he had to do
Good job you have a new show on Netflix
i kinda wish ants could speak now
Being sorry about being who you are...
Mf evolved to eat ants
The Fact The Ant’s…Mouth? Is Heart Shaped…   (Don’t Hate Me, I Don’t Study Ants.
Ants actually do commit cannibalism. I remember seeing a video where there's a queen head and an ant was dragging it. The dude who took the footage explained why.
Ants be friendly for now
I just started animating and it is very hard to draw like this.

ANTEATER=☠️💀☠️💀☠️💀☠️
Vore
Damn this was made when I was born
Wee🚽😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🎉
Label's are so over rated
And so he changed his title to 'Aardvark.'
The fact that he looks like an Aardvark and not an Anteater triggers me-
"I only live for about a day anyways, so I'm screwed regardless."

Just try not to get killed by your own food.😂
anteater: “I don’t really like ants, I actually enjoy eating termites more. But with a name like ‘anteater’, everyone just expects you to eat ants all the time!”  ant: “Well it could be worse, you could be called ‘suicide lover’ or something.”
Relatable (I’m the ant)

Wilbur soot hates anteaters.  There is no reason for me to be stating this fact but I did anyway.
Vore in a nutshell
Sniffles will tell me otherwise
It’s ok guys he understood
Some people will just ignore things because of politcs, sex, race and so many more. This is a topic that I'm glad you pointed out. The ant was very polite and I liked that part too.

Have you tried termites?
I love that ant you’re so chill
He needs therapy😷🤥
Anteaters actually don't eat ants, but termites. There's the story of an Anteater at a Zoo that was starving because the caretaker was feeding it only ants. Termites have more protein and less exoskeleton that makes them more nutritious.
I understant
god anteaters are the worst frickin animal
We all need that ant
Twist he was a fireant
He was an ANTIeater
Do you play adopt me
Can we all jusr take a srep back and appreciate how not funny and lame this is? Its not even cringe. Its prob polotics. Left or right never funny
It’s called an aardvark you know.
9:12 minuto più brutto del video😢
"Meh,eat me." Wha? "EAT ME!" I don’t think I can do this job anymore..
I really did just fucking read this as an teater
Anteaters are actually so picky they actually exclusively eat ants and termites
"i understand" *says an ant who is about to be devoured by an anteater*
This is the canonical bad ending btw  In the good ending, they wish each other well and go their separate ways
???

I understand
They eat termites too

Ant: *my time has come*
"Well, actually" - ESTP 2023 Seriously though, i'm pretty sure an empath cries whenever they see someone crying. Not just someone they care about. I think it's more likely he just has high empathy... Or is an HSP...

“I understand.”  *getting dragged into the void*
😂😂❤
🤨

Stereotypes am I right?

Tough cookies, pal.
labels
I have never once in my life laughed at an Odd1sout short
😭😭😭
Bro just accepted his fate and said “I understand”
Man really said I understand entering into a fricking kamikaze pilot
Anteaters feed almost exclusively on ants and termites
@Wilbursoot
This moment is just pure peace
Dude you're an anteater ant eaters don't just eat ants eat berries instead then. You didn't have to eat your friend. nooooooo!!!!!
"I understand" *gets swallowed*
The ant just lets him eat him very funny 😂 also I like the stereotypical theme he went

Last word I understand
This poor guy
Still wish the track was as good as the music 😂
What about oddballs season 3?
Its look like hes it the ant that so sad!😢
That was sad he ate a cute ant
They actually eat termites
Famous last words "I understand"
This is sad and funny at the same time don’t ask me I’m not gonna be able to explain it
This is cute
really they don't like eating ant
AHAHAHAHAH🤣😂
I understand 10 min later BULLET ANTS ATTAK

Plot twist: he eats ants because he doesn’t like them
Who that's sad 😢
"Is that right"
Fun Fact: Anteaters actually prefer termites, but do eat ants if they don't have any termites around.
Thats hella depressing
My face the whole time 😐
I’m sorry about this *chomp*
Forced to eat things you dont like
"I'm sorry about this" "I understand" He accepted the fact that he was going to be eaten since he sat down
Poor anteater...
Bro this ant is soooo chill
This was just wholesome in a way
Gy😊
It got dark at the end.
I thought it was aunt eater because people say aunt as ant
oh mo  nast
He really just accepted he's fate like it was complitely ok, it's like jumping right into a snake's mouth and accept it
Why is no one freaking out about the ant?!?!?? #antappreciationassociation
did he eat the ant when he grabed him?
):
I can smell ants the smell is very strong
I love how understanding the ant is and how much the anteater doesn’t want to eat him but everyone expects him to eat ants just because of his species’ name. This is one example of peer pressure at it’s finest and can show how irresistible peer pressure can be
The ant is the type of bug with no enemies
Why did those anteaters look like elephants?
He has served his queen
It so sad 😞 😔 😟 🙁 😥 😿 😞 😔 😟 🙁 😥 😿 😞 😔
ANT:EAT ME
If nature was polite:
You finally made your own show
That is such an accepting ant
The ultimate betrayal that isn’t really a betrayal
How does he even make an ant cute-
Cringe factory
Plot twist: ant has a vore fetish
The anteater:NOM
wwwwwwwwwhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhyyyyyyyyyyyyy!

That ant is fearless
Ant casually sacrifices himself
Rip ant
Any anteater’s eat ants every day
It's okay, I used to think fire ants were on fire..
Stereo typing we do but we don't like to know the fact that we do,or have done. Same issue?

It’s cool how he turns his old comics into animation
How do you make animation? what app you use?
Am I dumb for not getting it, lmao, is he just in denial? Why does he say he doesn’t even like eating ants but then goes on to eat the ant? So confused lol. I’m assuming the joke is that he is trying to deny his true nature? Saying he doesn’t like ants but he rly does? Lmao idk
That’s a very understanding ant
I just love all your videos

You’re so cute🎉❤

The ant had been ready for death for a while, he accepted his announcement of death without hesitation.

I thought they would say I actually eat termites

It is my nature 😔
Is your show gonna keep going I like it
HES AN ANTEATER MAKE YA WORK-                   I cut myself off.
Bro there's legit an odd1sout show on netflix         BRO WTF?!!!
Why was it so hard for me to say anteater💀
Ants probably don't care too much about dying, honestly. They're way different from the typical animal, and they're more like "limbs" of the colony.
L furry
The Anteater is just tricking the ant, so he can eat him without any resistance 💀
I understand how that feels
Not an animation and little story for me but I appreciate the effort. It just doesn’t quite add up despite how cute it is.
I feel like half these people in the comments are bots
Bro project remember when I gave you that pencil back in kindergarten
Hold up
Why is he’s mouth shaped like a heart
Gay anteater 🤣😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

MY FAVORITE ANIMAL
Anteater sees the ant as the only person he can talk to, but whom he is destined to kill
That was surprisingly dark I thought he would’ve left him alone 😭
What's the ant sed is that right he sounds so cute 😍
https://media.tenor.com/xvFtxVmfaXcAAAAM/spiderman-thats-it.gif
Plot twist he loves eating ants and this is his technique
Imagine showing this to the bros. I can't. This is boring.
Guess the anteater is a non ant-eating ant-eater
Noooo whyy you.  Nooooo
So he lied to him... At least the ant was at peace when he went.
Shark tale anyone?

But… the ant is eating!  The ant IS the ant eater!!
Ant is a G
😮
This is boring. Look at all the boys liking this and commenting how "cute" it is. I bet there's a "can we just take a moment to..." comment that has thousands of up votes. This has all become so predictable. Generic, uncreative and boring material is grandized by fake accounts and small mind. What a sad time we live in.
🗿
Gay gay gay gay gay gay you are gaygaygay

Why don’t you change your species then. Or don’t give into peer pressure?

da ant is soo cute!!!
Hey guys I’ve got some really great news to share with you, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on a cross and resurrected on the third day so you may all have eternal life. If you believe and repent of your sins and put your faith and trust in Him as you would a parachute jumping off a plane at 25000 feet up in the air, He will give you eternal life in heaven as a free gift and I promise you, He will change your life forever as He did mine. He is the ONLY way to heaven and He loves you all. Please think deeply about this with urgency because this is your eternal life and soul, you don’t know when you could die, meaning you could die at any moment, so please consider this with all your heart. If anyone tells you that Jesus isn’t the only way, they are lying to you and they don’t care about your future.
They like to eat termites rather than ants.
His last meal
I’m sorry but you have a cookie crumb
Odd1snout
At least the ant understands how he truly feels.

Psp 2 😢
ant-"I understand" ant-*prosedes to be eaten silently*
So cute and innocent 🥰
Bro from the title i thought this is going to be one of those "let me do it for you" videos.
This cartoon weirdly illustrates the messed up nature of popular American culture. This guy is an anteater. Something’s wrong if he doesn’t eat ants. Yet instead of concern and finding out why he has a problem he vents to the ant, his victim, who commiserates and gets consumed and everyone in the comments thinks this is so sweet. People really are out there being ridiculous and we’re all supposed to just roll over and let them do whatever they want with us. I know too deep but I really don’t like this cartoon.
I was waiting for a heartfelt ending, and I got it.
Rest in peace the ant that understood 🥲
Whats next? Anttreater?
☝️🤓 actually they prefer termites
I was wondering why the voice sounds familiar...& Then I notice it's odds one's out
😂😂😂
Dont google "ant head under a microscope"

Hey man it's okay to vent sometimes, i am not good at words but, you can do it, and we're proud of you for reaching this far, we are all rooting for you, please don't hesitant to call for help, calling for help isn't a weak thing, it's a strong thing, i really want to let you vent with me right now but i know we're like strangers or something, but your problems are vailed remember that.
Fun Fact: Anteaters can actually kill you with their sharp claw.
Eathans girlfriend looks like she’s  just went clean form an extreme coke addiction

It's si cute but si sad at the same time ;-;
Why didn't he eat the ant before
They mostly eat termites
Eat the ants
Yummy
Bro that’s sad that he died at the end
Y’all remember the ant in happy tree Friends and what they did to the ant eater
3 seconds later  It hit me that the ant was saying all that because it was awkward to eat a consenting ant. The ate the ant and it thought he was helping his friend off the table.  I was right but it was also to his mouth💀💀💀💀😭😭😭
Wait... wait no hold on!
R.I.P ant

The most friendliest anteater an ant will ever face
You have to do it on my name and by the way to u
Darn that ant was so cute though and wholesome that’s kinda sad
Fun fact. Anteaters don't eat ants. They eat termites.

Fun fact anteaters eat thirty five thousand ants and termites in a day
"I understand"
The one person that understands him, he eats, huh

While we are busy watching this: Ant-Eaters take over the world and become 'human-Eaters'

Hey.... is that ant a jojo reference 🤔???
furry
I can't believe this video has 1 Crore views lol..
He should’ve eaten the cookie instead
He took his death like a man
He was way to polite and cute for this world...
Anteaters are actually very, very, very dangerous if you give them a reason to be. So please give them the respect like the respect they give you (represented by the anteater here). Or else you will first get the T-pose, then you’ll send a postcard from heaven.
Ethan literally has 5 drinks next to him
hi
Did her/he just get eat by they big man?!
The moment you realise that maybe he procured the cookies for the ant, before eating him consensually...
I understand 😌
Don't they eat termites
For some  reason i thought it was an "AntTheatre"
Don’t let Wilbur see this
Good Netflix show  I love it ❤
he just accepted his fate
Anteaters be like "let me do it for you"
Idk they kinda have a mouth ment for eating pasta. So maybe he could be a Pastaeater instead? 😅
When said I don’t like ants you’d think the ant would be like well duh and then the ant eater would say no I mean I don’t like eating ants and the ant would say oh and then the rest happens you know.
Bro smooth😂😂
Noooooooooo poor ant ya didn’t have to eat it 😭 ya could have been long time friends
Hmmm

Isn’t he the ant eater
An existential crisis
For some reason I called them aardvark
Most chill ant on the planet right now
Dude I keep rewatching this just for the ant to say “labels man”  Idk why but it’s so reassuring wtf
well good news for him, anteaters actually primarily eat termites.
E
I hate to be the pooper of a parade but, No! No, no, no, know, no, no... If dude doesn't even like ants and doesn't like subscribing to the objectivity of labels, why would he succumb to the pressure of adaptive labeling and consume the life of a creature he doesn't even enjoy eating? Plus! the ant willingly and passively gave up it's existence on the off chance it might have made the anteater feel slightly less uncomfortable with it's scientific naming even tho it didn't want the perform the act the ant was passively losing its life over? Nothing about this made any logical, philosophical, or basic sense at all and I'm dissappinted in every single "aww...cute" commenter in the section
Poor ant
Bruh the ant is a g
I love this. ❤
you own nothing and be happy
I’m sorry man  ant:I understand 😢😢😢
Big brain way to eat it without it fighting back
Noooo
Om so sad for that nice ant I wish he lived as much as he loved

As a fan of ants, I can confirm I want to gather up anteaters in one big metal room, tell them it's a shower, and drop in a molecule of potassium+water through the ceiling (explosive reaction)

I like how he said "I actually don't like ants" in front of an ant
:(
I UNDERSTAND LOL
Well, try the cookie, lol.
Let's just take a moment to realize, that an ant eater can kill a person, and break concrete
Dont show Wilbur soot this
They are actually called Aardvark’s so this video makes absolutely no sense. I’m ashamed to have even watched it.

Termites
if you dont like ants then eat then cookies that are literally RIGHT BESIDE YOU
“I understand… THE HORRIBLE MISTAKE YOU MADE!”  *ant takes out katana*

Bro does not fear death legend ✊
I hate anteaters.

Fun fact: most anteaters main diet actually consists of termites, not ants.
Interesting.
Why do people think that
“Don’t judge a book by it’s cover.”
It's A Big Big World Joins The Chat
He doesn't like ants so he eats them to get rid of em
I know its adorable but in the end he eats him
The ant is cute and understanding when the anteater says he’s sorry that’s he going to eat him. What a nice ant friend
Cute

“There’s nothing Schmidt’s about domestic violence”
Yeah ants tastes gross
First of all and do you does it programmed into their mind to like eating Ants so yeah it’s would be very hard to find an anteater that does not like eating ants near impossible actually and not in a nerdy way actually like a normal way actually I’m not one of those nerds that always says well actually

Avoid danger fun fact: if an anteater t-poses run as fast as you can they are stronger than you think I think they can scare of a tiger from what I heard
Then you have Sniffles in Happy Tree Friends that gets annihilated by the ants every time 😂, must be an alternate universe 💀
I would've pointed the guy over to my friend Timmy instead, he's had it too good for too long...
Im sad now
Anteater lied. He's just tired of having ants be terrified of him so he offers them a snack and talks to them before he eats them.

If I had a nickel for every time I saw a prey creature comfort its predator as it was eaten, I'd have 2 nickels. Which isn't a lot, but it's really weird that it's happened twice.

Let's always do good 🙏
Okay 😐

But they do eat ants isn't that weird???
Wait!
In portuguese, anteater is called tamandua wich doesn't mean anything at all
Anteaters also eat termites
Well to be fair some Anteaters don’t eat that many ants. A few’s diet actually consists primarily of termites.
Antmature
Kind of a nice death until stomach acid and teeth
Vile
Theo energy here. He asked.
Plot twist: when the anteater said he doesn’t like ants he doesn’t mean that he doesn’t like eating ants but instead he hates ants and was misleading this one.
He better find a rock soon lol
is there even anyone around to see this lol is he caving to peer pressure alone
The way the Anteater ate the ant after the conversation was funny and weird in the same time ;3;

I don't think an anteater can eat anything other than ants so that would kind of suck if you didn't like the taste of ants
WHAT IF... TheOdd1SOut X DO0M
-was the last thing he'd say to the Anteater before falling into a painful slow death in the acid filled stomach.
Wholesome is the only thing that can describe this short
No dont make the Amphibia finale hit hard i still havent fully coped with the original one-
He should have eaten the cookies with new ant friend v.v instead he ate cookie flavored ant
That makes me feel so bad about the ant ;-;
:sob:
NoOOO make a part 2 where he becomes himself and then the ghost of the ant visits
But it's their main food source...what?
Not to mention with his biological he literally CAN'T eat anything else. A burger? A cookie? Not even an option

Peer pressure and societal expectations can be a bit too much, so this polite and kind ant lets the anteater eat them
I'm not four push you garbage on some one els
Kinda wish this joke had a twist like, the anteater eats the ant's cookie crumb instead. It was cute but the predictability made it hard to find it funny.
I misread anteater and thought it said anteayer ༎ຶ⁠‿⁠༎ຶ

Well looks like the ant got something nice to eat before he got eaten
I don't understand like when the aunt says I understand I don't understand I just just doesn't make sense like the ants and reality would just be running around telling everyone that anteater coming for them
At the end he ate the ant 🐜

Anricheat
At least he died having a good meal
If you’re reading this I want you to know that God loves you and He cares about you so much that He became a man (Jesus Christ) and died for you. Repent and believe in the gospel, He is the ONLY way to heaven. You can’t get into heaven by doing good works and you don’t have to go to a priest to confess anything. Cry out to Him through prayer He will not turn you away.  Dive into His word (The Bible) for guidance and do not continue in your sins. Make His word the final say in your life.
Wow this anteater actually looks like an anteater and not a bear with glasses

When Rick roll says SAY GOODBYE  you just like I understand...
Wilbur: now I have to explain to another my hatred for the animal Wilbur fans: oh okay then.
He hugged or eated him?
Dang
Kid: “I’m gonna burn you with this magnafine glass!” Ant: I understand...” Kid: “what the hell?!”

I can understand that, even though, the truth is they're more of termites and neo worms. Never once, ants

At least he got that ant with a crumb of a cookie
Uhhhh what was that
oof
Is it me or he looks like hypno
I hate hazelnuts my name is Hazel
Poor ant just excepting his fate
Hide the ant eater from Wilbur
Let's get this trending. #JusticeforAnteater
He's just hugging the ant and said sorry for venting. Dont worry, the ant is totally fine :)
This is so wholesome
Giant anteaters actually eat a lot more termites than ants but I guess termite eater doesn’t have the same ring to it.
Pff
I understand
The fact that this ant is so calm, bc most ants goes crazy running tbh
every ant is an ant with 20 nieces and nephews
I just watch Wilbur soot and went to Shorts and found this I'm sorry Wilbur soot 😶
Anteater : I don't know who am I?? God : bish ur name is litteraly your purpose in life
Lol
Respect the ant for understanding
😳😳 labels man
That’s a foodie 🐜😋
But I saw video with an anteater raiding the ant's nest. It gobbled them up😨
When your food is your therapist
NOTHING PERSONAL ANT
YMCAIT's friends with the anteater Anteater eat ants
Very sad moment😇

Plot twist: he likes eating ants
ANTEATER LOVE EM But labels

Wilbur soot sends hatred of anteaters.  I say the animation quality is goog
Asexual guy in a bar with friends

At least he understands
If the circle of life was like this
This is kinda sad they were friends and the anteater ate him.😭😭
You can never forget that the anteater will give you a warning before he gets you on a news headline.
I love your videos they make me laugh all the time
Ant: "understandable, have a nice day"
Yes
Omg imagine if anteater just vacuumed ants into the snout thing instead of using a tounge
Among us
Fuck anteaters.
Someone needs to send this to Wilbur
This guy, he knows how to make wholesome content
For this your name is anteater
Ant
Poor anteater 😭💋
Fun fact: James used most of his comics to make what we know today.
Imagine if giants didn't like eating humans.

Ilove speaking with my food
I'm sorry about this  Eats him whole
“Is that right?”
Could pronounce An-Teater?
the Anteater's problem is actually applicable to a lot of people and the labels society places on them
Termites also make up a large part of the anteater's diet, so he could just say he's ant intolerant and just eat termites.
This video: *exists* Wilbur soot fans: WE took that personally
Anteater: doesn't like eating ants Also Anteater: eats an ant I just thought this was funny XD
The way the ant just calmly accepts his own death is terrifying.
Wait, so anteater's snout is a...trunk? What do they don't have jaws? Well, gotta go google anteaters.
VORE
Noooo he betrayed he only friend
🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
Poor anteater
Well he could be an aunteater
Bro that ants' entire vibe made me like him as quickly as i came to know it's existance.
I understand As he dies
I need a friend like ant.
And it sucks for the anteater cause he has no teeth. So he can’t eat anything else
Every day we descended further from god
And he's dead
What a nice ant
Oh lord I don’t wanna see how
Anteaters literally can't eat anything else since they have no teeth they have reached a dead end in evolution
Antlions aren't ants, they eat ants.
That ant just excepted his death right there the chilliest ant I’ve ever seen
Anteaters prefer termites
“I understand”
God loves you
This ant seems like a good friend. He let the anteater eat him alive
Wilbur: 🔪
Such a peaceful acceptance of death, thanks for making me question my moral compass OddOnesOut
Just be glad your names not "Aardvark!"
Wow dummy dummy did you look that up then copy and paste
That ant is more understanding than my family
Anteater: I don't like eating ants... Greenland and Iceland: First time?
Fun Fact: Anteaters also eat termites
Fun Fact: the german word for anteater can be translated to antbear (Ameisenbär)
Wilbur would be punching the air rn.
I HATE ANTEATERS SO MUCH, THERE IS NO WAY IS HELL I CAN HAVE COMPASSION FOR SOMETHING THAT HORID
Ah yes. CASUALLY POSTING VORE ARE YOU YOU JAMES!!
I feel so bad for him he doesn’t want to s be an anteater anymore he wants to eat normal food
I'm an ant and I understand is okay anteater
This is like being lesbian if your a girl some people expect you to date a man same for men people expect men to date woman and it doesn't matter if you're gay do what you do best
Once my dad almost got his leg bitten off by an anteater in a zoo...     Then a bear escaped and ate all the boars
RIP Here lies “The chillest and most understanding ant there ever was” 2021-2021

Anteater- •chewing ant• Ant "completely calm"- its ok, im alright with this

casually gives in to fate and accepts the inevitable end at the hand of a being far larger and much more powerful than you
RIP random ant
His fate is sealed, but in spanish anteater is called "oso hormiguero" or in the litteraly translation "anthill bear"
Did the ant just commit suicide?

Ant: “label’s man”.
Ant eaters are terrifying

The fact that the ant literally just accepted it is just dark
God you’re an anteater. Anteater do I eat ants. God no go eat termeites

Anteaters actually eat termites
I have a question how do you make these animations
James you racist

I thought he would draw Arthur...idk... Arthur just eating a bowl of ants with D.W complaining in the background
That’s a real chill ant
It’s actually really really really cute

God-*creats anteaters*     Anteater - what my purpose again?     God- annoy Wilbur soot

He probably likes termites more
BASICALLY BEASTARS

Everybody gangsta till you realize that it ate an Asian Bullet Ant and the entire colony marks it as a threat
unfollowing you furry
Two powerful beings were created... The Ant and The Ant Not *The Ant is strong but the Ant Not will always be stronger.*
This is the first odd ones out video in a while without James saying wear your seatbelt
This is like someone who’s closeted. Where they and they’re partner break up due to the closet’s parents.
Plot twist: he was just holding him because he couldn’t use his ha-I mean hooves.
You see, I think Wilbur would see this.
i am hiding in my hole anteaters keep following me!!
Wilbur wouldnt like this video
Uhhhh
Is it weird that I’ve always felt bad for anteaters? They don’t even have a jaw they can’t open or close their mouths. Such a sad life
Foul Creature
Plot twist:the ants a termite
What a Kind ant...I guess he wouldn't care if he CROSSED THE ROAD...

ant eater just casually eats ant after saying i don’t like ants
And that, my friend, is what speciesism does to a creature.

You can call it TAMANDUÁ then.
That was deep
Coooooooookie

Miss old storytime vids
Thank you for making a new vid

Why was that actually so cute 😂
*✨Wholesome✨*
R.I.P MR ant 🐜
Why did he eat it if he doesn't like eating it
This Is Really Relatable... Btw If Anteaters Really Don't Like Eating Ants Just Expected To Eat Ants....  Then Humans Might Need To Re-Think About Names   But To Make It Up  Have a Cookie 🍪
looks like an elephant to me  ._.
Have I told you my hatred for anteaters?
Ants genuinely don’t care if they die. They have a group mentality that would make the USSR scream “love me sempie”
how itachi felt before killing his parents

Dunno why the aardvark hates ants, there *delicious*
You should do one for misquote eaters when they actually don’t eat misquotes
my 6 year old self when my parents told me to eat 'real food':
Anteater?Ha! More like Cookieater

That ant was ready to die
:) I dont want ant eaters but I would agree when they dont like ants
Wilbur is disturbed

James is running out of ideas
Plot twist:he doesn't eat him he pulls out all the ants legs out and the body and eats them one by one and finally the head then he shits it out then he burns it
Hey you should move out of the United States!! FREE HEALTHCARE is offer if you move to somewhere in the EU

I think he ate the ant but why?
Hi🙂
When he becomes the famous ant eater who brought peace between anteaters and ants, he’s gonna say “In memory of that ant who let me eat him.”
That's a nice ant.
There are having another Magic the Gathering are having a challenge it's a commercial too I just found on YouTube
Hey... This is weird to ask but... Are you gay? I don't judge anyone... I just saw some stuff in other videos. Love your videos! BYE!

You should make a video on Godzilla next

So wholesome but gruesome at the same time
Hey James There is a rip off of The odd 2 out someone’s trying to copy your stuff
Just Sayin that uhhhh anteaters mostly eat termites

Why jaiden is not uploading videos
Fun Fact: this shorts is actually an old comic (im pretty sure its old)

Tem gente que dubla seus vídeos no Brasil
Eu sou do Brasil
A
A certain British man who sings about women will not like the title/video
hi, aah, i would like to ask a favor if i'm not bothered, i usually watch your videos dubbed by someone in my language (don't worry they put the credits in), but they try to post these dubbing but it takes too long, so if it's not too long how could you add subtitles in portuguese Brazil? if it's not boring and I'm translating it through Google, to see how bad my English is
Why does this feel like the plot of a National Geographic documentary? Or is it just me?
POV: you live in the uk so only just got this notification.
ha tell me
do you even check you r comments
Worker ants can live up to 15 years and Queen ants can live up to 25 years.
14 sec only i thought you were better than this James
Haha😅 you probably don't take me seriously but can I be an intern or something even tho I don't have the supplies, skill and experience but just to learn. I knew it, no one is going to take me srsly! But worth a shot, ❤️❤️  If you take me in I will work for free tho! Even if I get to learn very less I will be really useful.  Thanks for reading if you did.....
to ture for this ant lables
Please make shorts for a new channel called TheOddShortsOut.
Lol
THE FURRY LORD HAS AWAKENED (im not a furry, people just call you that)
Turns out he ate a bullet ant
What a calm ant even though it knows it’s gong to die
...
So he's drawing an anthropomorphic animal in an animation huh? Suspicious... that coupled along with my totally not stalkerish act of going through all your subscriptions and finding furry channels leads me to believe your a furry and I'm rioting intill you admit it. This is day one. From - An Annonymous Furry.
Why are yuo not posting much? We miss yuo

This is his least viewed video on his channel
No offense what you do is great but can you go back to normal vids
Hey ... Do you know chipflake ...?

James (other animators such as jaiden) should redo their old videos, like a remastered edition.

The fact that because I save ants in my park people make fun of me and call me anteater :(
I saw on Tim tok
am James dumb question but are you out of idios (btw love your vids)
Wilbur dislikes this video
I can count the keyframes  even then I couldnt make something comparable so I should just shut up
Wilbur Soot is mad.
My man takes soooooo long to upload like a million years

There are ceremonial guardians of the Tower of London in England known as "Beefeaters".   When I visited London, there was a whole group of em fighting over a piece of steak in the courtyard! Then the Queen came out of a doorway and hosted a banquet for them so there would be no more "beef" between them.  ... where was I going with this comment?
Lmao
Please make an actual video next time And not a short PLZ😊

James if you see this comment say LETS GOOO on your future video
Cute
Just believing, reading the bible, and going to church can never be what it takes... You need to be in a relationship with OUR CREATOR and TRUE SAVIOR more than you obsess over your most out of control obsessions...  Please make clear the way, fore, the arrival of OUR TRUE SAVIOR is at the door!!!!!!!
Please do what do I think of YouTube shorts
Pov:no sabes Inglés pero aún haci disfrutas los vídeos de Jhames

Is this like that one sharktale character?
‘Labels man’  I MEAN WERE SCAVENGERS NOT HUMANS **CRAZY LOOK**
noice!!!
Please read this carefully ;  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago He left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake .  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make.   Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 )  ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.
Get stickbugged lol?

This video says something about the society we live in...
They t pose when they are being threatened

Hiii
James i read your first book and you said the magician harry houdini asked people to punch him. That's not true. You just made that up. And he didn't die to a ruptured appendix. He died to appendicitis.
When you think about it anteaters have a pretty high kill rate with all those ants they eat...
Fun-fact:The T-Pose is an anteaters self defense pose
The ants I see are a little more mean
Why are short so popular
rip ant timmy
That's true!
Nice animation
i still hate anteaters

sonic woah

And the ant goes to the unholy pits of hell to burn and suffer for eternity
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping you from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Labels man

Sad moment
Hey james how is our girl friends anything ok
Can u pls make more vids
aww poor ant
“For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever. Therefore encourage one another with these words. Now, brothers and sisters, about times and dates we do not need to write to you, for you know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night. While people are saying, “Peace and safety,” destruction will come on them suddenly, as labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape. But you, brothers and sisters, are not in darkness so that this day should surprise you like a thief. You are all children of the light and children of the day. We do not belong to the night or to the darkness. So then, let us not be like others, who are asleep, but let us be awake and sober. For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, get drunk at night. But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, putting on faith and love as a breastplate, and the hope of salvation as a helmet. For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ. He died for us so that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with him.” #LordJesusiscoming

times!!
And we never saw him again
" Labels man,"
Got to agree...hate labels
Oh ok
I have all ur books and my package for cafe chaos hasn’t been delivered for 4 5 months
there's a certain revived ex-president who hates anteaters
Ants being polit and nice  People: SQUUSH THEM
Can you make jaiden vs you
Ok
I'm so sorry  Don't worry **ant gets eaten**
Ants last words hey my names Bryson or labbles man
I love the way the ant just accepts it without hesitation
Hey james do you stil remember harry? :( He died right
After watching this for a while i finaly understand what just happend.
Peer pressure in a nutshell
Ok
What??
Next up: Wilbur Soot hating on anteaters.
Labels man...
Wilbur will hate this
This was the *most* innocent thing I’ve ever seen.
Wilbur Soot is fuming right now
Man labels
Where’s Wilbur when you need him
Wilbur would be upset
Is it ever weird wearing your own merch and thinking “damn. I really mad it this far”
why does wilbur hate them?
To anyone who reads this.. Jesus loves you, so much more than anyone on this earth ever could! He died for you and me on the Cross, conquering all sin so that we could be free, and have access to a life beyond, where there is no more agony or worries; only pure joy and everlasting happiness.. up there in Heaven!  This may be true, but the only way for that beautiful Sacrifice to have complete effect, you need to accept Jesus as your Lord and true Savior, and repent of all sin.  This is because we are binded to a flesh that will succumb to all kinds of desires, a flesh that is binded with sin by nature, sin that God doesn't love, and wants us, through that acceptance, to turn away from it and become pure.  Jesus wants you to be part of His eternal family, and wants to help you, strengthen you, fill your heart and restore you until the day we actually meet Him.  Life with Him is so much easier; Don't lose this chance because of this world's vanities. What we go through here and acquire is only temporary, and God wants us to strive for more than this... He is very close!  *John 3:16* "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."  God bless anyone who reads this, and again, Jesus loves you!😄
😄 The anteater ate the ant
he doesn't upload of over a year then he finely uploads and its a 14 second video.
Why can’t the anteater just eat the cookies? Well this is sad
Aww this is great lol
I don’t think we can call this guy TheOdd1sOut anymore, he has 16.7 million subscribers.
The ant just wanted to have a nice conversation 🥲
The sad life of an anteater
You should make a channel called Theodd1sout Shorts
The ant is adorable
this seems familiar...
This was AMAZING
hey life is fun is now his most pouplar vid
He should try Termites for a change.
This is anteater therapy where the therapists are ants
I really wish to know Wilbur's opinion if he saw this
Huh?
o7
I hate them there so ugly why do any eaters exist
Adventure time vibes
So much for not liking ants huh
so why yt is sending me notificacion ONE DAY LATER?
“Labels,man”
You dont upload storytimes videos anymore thats sucks
HEY KID,WANT SOME explaining because i'm curious why you got a fursuit
When will you post real actual videos
Aww
low key deep
"I understand" - famous last words.
I understand  ...          Wait
James, not this video but in one of your videos you mentioned that you watch anime while animating and I just wanted you to know I watch your videos while animating😊😊😊😊.
Rip ant
I L it
Yes! That's what I called respecting your friends! To treat others you want to be treated
Man. That anteater is adorable
Why so shorttttt!!!!!!!!
Pls make a intresting video like a long one
Anteaters eat termites, actually
Plot twist: the ant just has a vore fetish
"and then he vored him. The end."
Very emotional 🥺😟
Sad, but the ant is chill with it
Wow....
I didn't think theodd1sout would do consesual vore but here we are
Saddest animation ever
I’m subscribed, bought your 2 books,and have your game can’t catch Harry and your mobile game lets bounce and have your plush of subway James all I need is cafe chaos
R.I.P ant 2021-2021 you will be remembered :(
Mood
Don’t show this to Wilbur Soot
They're so polite.. Like.. I'm gonna let my little bro see this vid to learn how to be ★POLITE★
Great  pair
I used to eat out my uncle instead
this is kinda accurate, cuz anteaters also like termites and other small insects
This anteater is literally the exact opposite of how real anteaters behave.
wow that's profitable
E
"I hate anteaters so much Phil"  -Wilbur Soot

Not funny
At least that ant got to eat a cookie before getting eaten
"I understand" *crunch*
Awwww the ant is very cute
Awww 🥺
Happy birthday month!!
Sad
Keep up the good work James!!
Lol so funny!
Lol
Why didn't he just take a cookie too?
When he is eaten: 0:13
Who the hell got this on trending, I mean it's not even funny

Short
Yes
That's so sad
BRUUh game theory: secretly vore?!!!

Too political. Unsubscribed
0:04 that is the cutest drawing of of an ant
damn 2012 vibbbbesss
This but the ant eats you
Just casually gets on trending
Last year i was in a beach house with my family and the beach house had a front yard that we played soccer and tag on anyways we live in a hot country in the middle east (Bahrain) so there were a lot of those fairly big ants and ine of them was so big that i thought ut was a cockroach and that same and almost bit me it had really big mouth or idk what theyre called but ut bit my pants and i tried removing it with tweasers but it didnt let go and its head was super large so i killed it thinking that if will fall but its mouth was stuck and it was hanging on my pants so i took a pair of scissors and kinda broke the mouth i took a closer look and it looked just like this can  I crushed its head with the scissors because it wasn’t letting go
Is James just going to do shorts from now on? Pls don't!
LAAyBBBLES man
Thats what it gets smh. Worst animal.
When you're helpless & surrender politely! (Mon 24 May 2021 23h00)
Ysy
e
me when I say I don’t like eating Doritos    *BUT MY NICKNAME IS DORITO-EATER*
He accepted his fate
.
I like how he does these things he can upload quicker now
This is so wholesome I'm convinced he didn't even really eat him and instead they just became lifelong friends  the good ending
Rip ant
Do you remember the one kids vid you made ,James
open.spotify.com/track/3kkQopALo93gvpJaJKyEyI
Honestly, who else wants an extended version of this?
Getting real well animated jame
all i could think about during this was Wilbur Soot, and his hatred for Ant Eaters..
Video Idea: Haminations and TheOdds1sout collab
OH MY GOD! Well at least the anteater was polite about it
Rather polite chap
Rip my ant friend
We waited all this time for a 15-second short what happened to the regular videos
UHN CHILE ANYWAYS SO
The anteater just gave him a hug
Wilbur soot is shaking in his boots
yoyyoyo
what if ants didnt exist, what would anteaters be called
wait, you made 2 videos in one month, and on your birthday month? Who are you? (you're not lazy?!?)  Happy Birthday
Next:Harryeater
I actually felt bad for both of them
James has been gone for 1 month and he uploads one 15 second video and one 30 second video
Wilbur soot is disappointed in you
At least he died eating a cookie.
This is the correct way to eat an ant.
So sad. The ant knows man. He knows.
What heppend to the video called my British ex girlfriend
The ant Accepted his fate like a true chad😔
Yo my animations r cool
Atleast the ant had a nice conversation before his death

James is getting lazy

15 seconds long and 15 on trending
John 3:16 "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life."  Have a blessed day, brothers and sisters in Christ! :)

Amazing short. Adorable and lovely polite characters. Pristine oddonesout art style. ALL THAT ASIDE! We literally just witnessed the last moments of someone's life before their demise.
Oof

Plot twist: He _loved_ eating ants and didn’t want the ant to resist. In the words of Stan Pines, “Shhhhh. Stress will make you chewy.”
.,.
Wilbur ignore this
Ha nice
Atleast ant eater won't have to eat another ant for quite awhile. That last ant had a donk to feed a whole village
Me: Sees new Odd1sOut video Me: Presses intensely at the video and breaks iPad

Wilbur won't like this...
That’s just.......         FANTASIC.....

Die anyway." It's sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die. This is because you have sinned against God. Let's see if that's true: Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God will never let you down.Visit NeedGod.com.
Tonto el que lo lea

This is one of the Odd1sOut’s better videos, the animation quality is (in my opinion) better than longer ones.

Thanks for the Vid!
What if Wilbur see this short?
lol the truth about anteaters!

Damn such manners
Wilber soots level of respect for the odd1sout 📉📉
GIVE US REAL CONTENT
*Press F in the chat for the Ant.*  *2021-2021.You** shall be remembered for your kindness.*
Furry

Wilbur soot is going to either hate or love this
*Sadness*
A moment of silence for the ant 🐜 ✋😔

Uf
Like wilbur says, anteaters are just a shit animal.
I LOVE u jame
Bro where the ant at rn😭💀
Love these videos! They are so well produced. Stay safe everyone ❤️🙏
What a bro, willing to be food for his friend's sake
Lets take a moment to appreciate how the ant accepts its fate
MORE MORE
That ant was probably into *VORE* or something
Contact “Sba Help Centre” on lnstagram if you haven’t been funded or have any issues. I got funded yesterday. He helped me out. (Sba only).!!!!!
Hi
i want all people in the world to act like James' views on animals calm and understanding can get mad when they want to but not all the time
@wilbur
ayyyyyy
You should totally make One about a cat getting sick from drinking milk because cats are lactose free
So what you just gonna become a shorts channel now? no more uploads for actaul videos your really starting to go down hill
He accepts his fate and lives happily in ant ✨HEAVEN ✨
I dont understand, whats point of video? Moral?
nooooooo
Sorry iys been a long time since i watch ur vid probobly 9 months well im back
This is 20% good content from Youtube #shorts... Show support on good stuff like this! Youtube shorts itself is not the problem... it is the bad content like TikTok reuploads or other cringe!
John 3:16-17 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen

Ok then
Rest In Peace, Ant Bro. You were the only one who understand.
https://youtu.be/vX3uix7IiIQ
Ant he ant him
Wilbur doesn’t like anteaters either
In addition to ants and termites, anteaters also eat soft-bodied grubs, soft fruits, and birds' eggs. Anteaters in zoos also eat things like fruits, hard-boiled eggs, ground beef, and dog kibble. -quick Google search

Anteaters suck
Wilbur won't like this vid
Please make more long films
Me a wilbur soot watcher: *down with the anteater*
"It's a little dark and wholesome, at the same time what is this."
The ant must been Canadian. Seriously though, Canadians are some of the nicest people you'll ever meet.
Adorable.

😂
sweet death
Ok I’m not out here being pushy I’m just saying it’s been what, 2-3 months? And the only thing he has published are shorts that go for no longer than 5 minutes one of those being just shamelessly plugging your merch. All I’m saying is that he has been very slack this year...

I once struck an ant using lightning
When the ant is Canadian :
*Hey, to you reading* ..... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
i think this is from a comic u made

My man ant was at peace even in the face of death may his soul Rest In Peace
I’m going to say it. I hate anteaters

He did have that cookie before he died tho R.I.P you lived a good life ant 😌
wtf is this also dead ant
a good friendship. Wish I had that.   * sobs in lonely magic geek *
What a valuable lesson I learned
Awww, did you do the ants voice??
Ok but if Wilbur soot saw this...i have no words to explain how blown up this comment section would be. Like he would just take over the comments about how disgusting anteaters are. Then try to make everyone eat sand..
Labels man.......
Well wilbur soot doesn't like anteaters and his name isn't 'i hate anteaters'
I though the joke was an teater like a theater like a pun but i was wrong
R.I.P ANT
he knew his time had came    R.I.P ant, 2021-2021
R.I.P ANT 2021 2021
boy, he died a good ant. he was too young.
I mean I guess burger-eater would be a better name
“I’m sorry about this.” “I understand.” I guess he just wanted a nice conversation before he died. Lol
Can’t wait for the Twitter vore community to make art of this. I have my eye bleach ready
XD good short man!
Heh
this is why I’m staying home 24/7
Wilbursoot would not approve /j
😆😆😆
_I understand_ He just accept his death Lol
Nobody: Wilbur Soot fans:
little did anyone know, the anteater never ate the ant, he took his bit of cookie and pretended to eat the ant, fooling everyone the anteater kept his reputation, and the ant gets to start a new life.
so nice...
When is the big news coming ?
Why
“We didn’t know we were making memories, we were just having fun”- Winnie The Pooh
Lol
I love ANTEATER
Society.
The dislikes are from Wilbur Soot's alts
That’s just sad
antnimation....
Be like ant accept all despite their differences
Dies
this shit is MEGA CRINGE
Man, I remember this comic. Glad to see it in animated form~
Little did he know that was a bullet ant
Omg sad :((
Those dislikes are from wilbursoot and his fellow ant eater haters
Can you make videos every week pls I would really appreciate that
literally the political climate in the US right now.
I like to imagine the anteater said "yum" right after the camra stopped rolling
This dude is making some shorts so people can have some new content while we wait for the long stories. Keep up the good work my man!
Andddd James has a vore fetish...And he's a furry...What else is new?
The most understanding ant ever, if only they were my parent, but im allergic 😢
#5 on trending and it’s a short
ˢᵘᵇˢᶜʳᶦᵇᶦⁿᵍ ᵗᵒ ᵉᵛᵉʳʸᵒⁿᵉ ʷʰᵒ ˢᵘᵇˢᶜʳᶦᵇᵉ
ˢᵘᵇˢᶜʳᶦᵇᶦⁿᵍ ᵗᵒ ᵉᵛᵉʳʸᵒⁿᵉ ʷʰᵒ ˢᵘᵇˢᶜʳᶦᵇᵉ
This gave me life
So what are you just going to quit story time animation
Well that was  #Short
wilbur soot should actually see this
How polite
He accepted
I’m Gonna *Smack*- Have A Nice Conversation With Whoever Made The Name Ant Eater,That Ant Was So Nice.
just make short videos so we can tell your alive or not
Ily ant
why is this #5 on trending?
No... I sad now :((
Anteaters eat around 35,000 ants per day so you really have to watch this video 35,000 times in a row to get the full “day in the life” effect
What DOES he like to eat then?
love your animations james :D
They eat termites too
Wholesome ending
BRO I WANNA CRY THE ANT IS JUST LIKE “I understand” 😭😭😭😭
Imagine being called an plant and meat eater as a name
Thus the ant was eaten, but the memory of this one ant and anteater as friends will be preserved.
achievement unlocked   kind buddy
I got my animation inspiration from you odd1sout (:
Ohhhhhh
That ant would be a nice man
what
There needs to be more vegan anteaters
Aardvarks have it better, they can eat what ever they want
Why it’s says 20 seconds ago for me
^w^ lol
69k likes Me- 😐🙂😏 Nice
S h o r t s
Hahahahaha
YES
So... Did the ant commit suicide or did the anteater commit murder? 🐜
Wilbur Soots not going to be happy about this..
Two weeks for that 15 second clip? I'm Sorry but I think it's time to unsubscribe.
Wilbur would be upset
New video????
Plot twist: the ant ate the anteater from the inside
Love videos
All the ants reactions when you step on them
Pls do one of your lifetime story pls 😅
It might be Gorey if it wasn't in James voice and animation
Sad violin music plays.
He understands
That animal woke up and choose ✨violence✨
Just accept death, am I right?
Can u plz post a real vid
I love that
I'm waiting for Wilbur Soot to comment his hatred for Anteaters
all i can think of is wilbur soot
I shall make a little grave for this ant
What’s the punchline, James?
Vore
An ant with chocolate chip cookie pieces...that had to have been an interesting meal.
Plot twist the ant isn’t being nice he’s just into vore.
Is James trying to give us a message about unwanted expectations
I was imagining the crunch
"Labels man" words from ant before he perished
Awwww the ant eater looks so cute
He ant accepted it so easily he’s a nice ant...
Hey James, can we get a 10 minute video instead of shorts!
Press F to pay respects
i love how the anteater picked up the ant so wholesome ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️
Bro no entendí nada pero amo tus animaciones UwU
bro the ant can rhyme
Poor annt
Damn bro u got the whole squad laughing.
WILBUR SOOT LOOK AWAY 🙈🙈😮‍💨
Dangit * sniff * WHY DO YOU HAVE TO DO THIS
Lol
This was a comic long ago ahhaha, animate more of ur coms
Nice
That was funny 😂😂😂
Nooooooooooooo Who even aunt some poison 🥺🥺🥺😭😭😭😭😭💔💔
I do not like Anteaters for many reasons
aaa
Wilbur Soup dont care if you dont like ants or not. He. Will. Kill.
god- james- wilbur probably gonna gets mad-
That whole “I understand.” UwU *gets eaten*
Hi James

Vore
he exepted death
So sad
..😠
...
...
....
weedeater
I understand
I understand
Wow, so understanding
"Izat righ?"
I bought ur second book about 3 hours ago and I already finished it lol (I loved it 10/10 would recommend)
I joke about getting an anteater because the type we get here are hard to get rid of. The first home I remember had fire ants that seemed immune to bug spray. I have no idea how to take care of one or where to get one. I'd probably would need a permit too. That ant is so understanding. I don't think many would be.
So the ant commuted suicide.
Lol it’s like the ant doesn’t care
he died an honorable man.  f in the chat for ant
Dang Wilbur soot is about to case the joint and murder that anteater
Lol
Man something is really BUGging me about this animation
Heartwarming and sad
F U R R Y
6 HOURS LATE YAS
to all the ants I ate as a kid, I am truly sorry.
plot twist he was just trying to get an easy meal
through anteater town after through anteater town after through anteater town after
Rip the ant
Good job on making it
It's Shark Tale but with an anteater
First short of theodd1sout
He even shared his cookies how polite but sad.
Nice
What the
I love how the ant is so polite!
Ant: hi also Ant 10 seconds later: ok, bye
Anteater: I actually don't like ants Me: you insulted the most polite ant ever then you ate him jesus bro thats cold *real cold*
Lul scam artist
Can you please post something that's more than 5 minutes long
D:
Would you PLEASE make a normal video again? I love your content, and no offense, but I really dislike your shorts.
Wilbur has joined the chat
A
THE RETURN OF THE KING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Man, even he hates eating ants.
I think that you should make a channel for shorts like  TheOdd1sout shorts
Dam thats what you call a true homie
LOL LOL LOL
Did anyone else get no notification even though they are subscribed to James?
Yes. I love this :)
Are you alive
Rip ant😢😢😢
Not sure what it is but it's on point. Just cause you don't like something, doesn't mean you have to like it
That warmed my heart
Labels man

Fs in the chat
If it's healthy for our diet, we don't have to like it.  We need to be able to tolerate healthy foods, at the very least, as this anteater has to tolerate eating ants.
YO LETS GOOOO
Wait you don’t post on may

rip ant now-now
I’m not watching this on YouTube shorts which is a little funny
He accepts his fate
This was a very emotional ride for me
R.I.P ant, 2021-2021. You will be missed
Wait.....whhhhat......
So when we gonna show Wilber?
whoa.
sad
ants are cool
Dunno what I can say that hasn't been said but this is cool
HEY ....................... can you theodd1sout help me animate and soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooub way is the best
Hii
F to pay respects to respectful ant
Yes only...yes
these kind of hilarious shorts makes my day 😂🤣
what
Sheeesh
Wilbur soot is typing...
The ending is strangely sad, wow
the best 15 seconds of my life
I feel bad for the ant
The dislikes are just Wilbur on different accounts.
I can predict James is gonna make a channel called TheOddShorts
Dude, James, Please upload a full vid. These shorts are kinda cool, but we want some full episodes. Your choice though.
😅 that ant was very kind
o-o.... well I will not unsee what happened
i understand
The ant knew what was coming for him and he just accepted his faith💀
I wish the oddonesout would make a long vid
Good to see he started uploading a lot
“I understand” “no not that way!”
Imagine just before you are about to be consumed by a huge furry beast and the last words you say are,    I understand :3
I hate these YouTube Shorts for several reasons:  1. They are just like tik tok. They are too short, and most don’t even make sense. 2. They are just everywhere. Everyone is making shoes and it is getting really annoying 3. Big content creators are doing shorts, which is not good. When we wait over a month for a awesome video,all we get is 5 sec of dumb stuff
Shortest video on his channel
So at what point am I supposed to laugh...?
Wholmsome
Here before Wilbur soots' comment
Deep
Yeah
James can u actually make like full sized videos pls
Ants   They suck     But they’re tasty too-
Damn bro labels man rip he had too unless people would be freaked out rip that ant too very understandable and nice
This is wholesome
F
*Wilbur soot wants to know your location*
It must take you a long time
Anteater
lavender marriages be like
This is op
I underst *Ant*
This is deep.
Love how James has been using Shorts more, feels like the perfect compromise for animation YouTubers, since animation takes so long
I understand
When’s is your next life story animation
Top 10 sadest anime death
I wanna be as content with my death as that ant
We need better content 😩
if we call tiktokers ants then people would call me antYEETER
He died
The ending is so GOOD
why does god hate ants so much that he made anteaters    ants: sHrEc WaZ bEd
This took such a long time 😞
I like to watch the odd one out
Let’s just change the name ant eaters to their scientific name Vermilingua, which no ant eater in that word, so wa la your safe from expectations XD
He shoulda said “I underst-ant”
😥
😐 you know... this kinda reminded me of something. Or should i say... made me remember a very horrifying memory of a similar setting. 😖 oh god, it's all coming back to me. Oh, oh no that horrible death scene. WHY?! WHY MUST I HAVE WITNESSED SUCH A THING?!?! Anyways... i hope the ant doesn't start to control him from the inside 😕
The ants voice is adorable
too top
I won’t get emotional over this *sniffles
The ants a Chad
Rip ant such a nice guy has my respect
I don't like ants, but I can't stop eaten em
I’m watching a squirrel run in circles what are you talking about
Where are the videos at man??
I see my two favorite things have mixed. The MCYT community (in the comments) and the animators I love.
Sometimes we all need to be the ant in our friend group
National geographic channel: anteaters like to eat ants   James: BOY WERE THEY WRONG
RIP the ant
Labels, man.
The ant was so cool with it
Labels. They *ANT* any fun!
I understand
I HATE YOU JAMES
Oh no odd1sout is out of ideas isnt he
Uhhh
vgjgvvjyhgyhgb
Today is my birthday
have a shorts Chanel or post these on the odd2sout channel
I wonder how @wilbursoot will react 😂
I feel like this has a deeper meaning to it but I can’t find it...
nooooooooooo!-
well then, he can switch to termites and grubs, which anteaters also eat.
Labels man
Noooo! The ant!
I heard they actually eat termites
Sounds like something that would happen in Beastars
I..
NOOOOOO
Don’t tell Wilbur soot about this
This is the cutest ant I ever seen in my life
JAMES WE NEED MORE VIDEOS IM OVER HERE BINGE WATCHING UR VIDEOS FROM 4 YEARS AGO. UR VIDEOS ARE AWESOME
Ant
Lol
Nice vid
This just made my day better. Thanks James!!
Wilbur would hate this
what if the stomach of the anteater was just filled with tons of ants partying
Nice
At least the ant didn't take it personally...
👁👄👁
Can we get an F for respecting the fact that that ant is so excepting? :,)
I feel bad for the ant
*Wilbur Soot would not be pleased*
Me to the kids in my basement
Anteaters beat cougars
And just like you started making f*ry v*r* videos.
Wow...
That went from "oh a normal conversation" to "oh my God what did I just watch?" In 10 secs
WOW- am i the only one that was like : 'OMG HE POSTED A VID- YASS'
I'm sorry, we don't serve ants in a cafe
people: "Nature is pure" Nature:
I feel his pain: being referred to as femboy people expect it to be like "UwU dwink this Mownster enewgy dwink" but that's actually not true, I don't even like Monster!  And all this just because I sucked a d-
I ACTUALLY DON'T LIKE EATING ANTS   ANT IS THAT RIGHT
wilbur soot is shaking
I miss the old days.... 😔
This is so emotional 😭😭😭😭😭
Wait why are people talking about Wilbur, I don't get it
,_,
Plz more plz more
Oof
What did i just watch ? 😅
uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh What thr trunk
Such a polite anteater
Cursed, but funny a crap
Hi
Ants actually don't like being eaten by anteaters but with a name like ants why wouldn't it be eaten by an anteater
Cool
I am confused
the dislikes are from peta
...
This is me with my pet bear
O god now james is posting for shorts
lol what a nice ant
Awww
Wilbur would not approve
My name is Anthony does that mean I am a ant?
Can I be in next next one
Hey James,I’m going to arazona in too days,can we meet up?
:,(
Me who's already seen the comics: I am 4 parallel universes ahead of you
I am stupid and I hate to inform that I don't get the joke
Wow James you've come so low
Lol
Life
Why don’t you make actual videos your job is literally being a cartoon character
deep man deep
*rip ant*
Make the Reluctant Anteater canonical!
...
He barely post
got dark quick
What breed of ant eater is it
I swear- I get these videos so late- AND I HATE IT
That’s one good ant
Mooo
Great job on this art pice
That ant was into vore...
its just sad
@crybaby_5670:John 3:16 “For God so loved the world he gave his one and only son and whoever believes in him shall not perish but live eternal life
Hi
I understand
Now that was a holsum moment
Imagine taking advice from the source of the problem
I thought they were just two buddies hanging out and talking but nope he ate the ant
Where Tf is Wilbur Soot @Wilbur Soot  Ayup M8 Where the fuck are u
Let's have a moment of silence for our insect veteran who sacrificed himself 🐜🐜🐜🐜
Wow
anteater's are my favorite animal!
vore
All the dislikes come from WilburSoot and his fellow anteater haters
more plz
Me after seeing this: ...... ok
Awww thats bad welp good sohrt vid
what a down to earth ant... and really down on earth
Finally content
“Any cat owner can tell you that being put inside a box is a lot different that hopping in a box yourself”
When I first read the comic I expected it to be much more dramatic with music playing in the background too.. I'm not disappointed though
Poor thing
He understands
Is this what his channel has come too
WHEEZE.
Dark yet strangely wholesome.
Lol
um.  ._.
Are you a furry?
Gas lighting. You are the ant
Hello
Anteater is sad for eating the ant
"I'm Sorry Little One... "
Labels, man.
Wilbur rn: LET IT DIE, LET IT DIE, LET IT SHRIVEL UP AND DIE!!!
what am i suppose to comment after watching that??
Ant eaters are also called aardvarks.
What if some anteaters don’t like ants, what are they going to call them
That “I understand” tho
Anyone else wondering why they didn’t just eat the cookies together
noo ant D;
Labels, man.
Labels man nuf said
Godzilla had a stroke trying to watch this and died
Ladybugs when their male: 👁👄👁
Rip ant
are you gonna do shorts?
He should do a reaction video of the walking dead
Is nobody gonna talk about how good that drawings were LITARALY all the shadows and details were on spot nice
That's funny
I wanna see James play Gartic phone with his animator buddies
Wilber would dislike this he probaly did
tells this to the ant just to make it seem ok to eat him.
Wilbur would hate this video
This reminds me of Wilbur Soot
The ant is so chill
Is this leading up to a video
That right there kids is what we call a bruh moment
Rip My ant friend
Eh the manga was better
F
Short
Can you actually upload videos
So polite
Lol
Am I the only one who found the ant to be so cute! Just me. ok
wilbur: *loud screaming*
“I understand”   the ant’s last words as he accepted his fate
Hmmm
Lol
So sad
Imma 'bout to curse this entire short with one word.            vore
OH MY
Stop making shorts pls... omg. I get that the algorithm likes them and stuff but i feel like all of youtube is turning into shorts.
DEPRESSING
i only can think about carl the ant (fairly odd parents)
I HATE ANT EATERS
Submissiveness. That’s the thing this fellow ant had.
Nice short 👌
Is this a trailer for a new DreamWorks film "Anteater tale"?
Yay early
XD
I understand
not funny
They like termites
So wholesome
Oof
That was worth the anticipation
Day 1 of asking james to Play fnf if u want- lol
I watched this 300 times repeatedly
funny
D:
So dose this mean there will be more of these videos
Aruther
What a kind and supporting ant.   If only people were like him
Damn that's deep
Evolving anteaters: “I don’t we should eat ants anymore”  The Ants: “ oh, um can you eat me one last time”
I’m a dog
Lmao
*is this a cry for help in disguise?* *someone go check on James*
Both of them are so polite
*Wilbursoot has joined the chat*
That "Is that right?" Deserves an Oscar
oh
The Ant seems to Understand... Kind of like me, what a good person...
Wilbur ain't gonna like this one...      /j (If you're not part of the Dream SMP fandom then you should know that this guy named Wilbur Soot hates anteaters with a burning passion)
Wilbur will be mad as hell
Anteater is now a *eater*
Someone send this to Wilbur Soot ;)
"I understand" the ant said as the long giant toung wrapped around him like a snake, dragging closer with each second to the black void that was the ant eaters mouth, now accepting his fate he closes his eyes and waits.
Don’t you release that u don’t have to eat him!!! And he was nice to
Aww
These are awesome. I hope their are a lot of these videos on this channel
We live in a society........
Dang its deep if you think a out it XD
Press F in the comments for the poor little ant fella
lol
Ant: “understandable have a great day”
#Shorts
Rip ant 2001-2021
Anteater babies terrify me 😳
At the last second I was hoping he will just be grabbing the ant to hug him or something...
"When your a *furry* everybody expects you to like every animal" "labels man"
Why is this just a short I want a new long video
I thought there was a twist like him being a fire ant and the ant eater lights on fire
Funfact: ants are one of or maybe even the most not tasty bugs in the BUG WORLD so bitting down on one not only will anger the rest of its colony but wont be tasting good (Unless they are lemon ants)
The ant has got my respect
Can we have more videos like camp geronimo or reality shifting
your running out ideas
Make more videos
RIP the ant. That anteater was just doing his duty.
I really like the pop
He finally uploaded. Wow. Way to break ur streak, OddOnesOut
That ant from bugs life he looks dumb and stupid
POG
Yes eat the poor little ant
Howdy James 🙃
Anteater:what if I started to call humans PIZZA EATERS!?   Humans:what no!    Me:just call me a weasel and I’m fine UnU
Understanding
Don't let Wilbur Soot see this
Here before trending
Love it
How an anteater lures an ant in.
Please do more of these shorts
Forgot 2 unsub, thanks!
Well, at least the ant accepted his fate
We just witnessed excepted murder… rip lil ant
TheOdd1sOut in a nutshell
You know this Anteater is right. They preffer to eat termites over ants but the name makes you expect they would preffer ants instead.
Don't let Wilbur Soot watch this, he will be traumatized
Hi
Sooo now James start to make short video or maybe he runout of stories to tell😃
He's not like other anteaters
ᵒⁿˡʸ ˡᵉᵍᵉⁿᵈˢ ᶜᵃⁿ ˢᵘᵇˢ ᵗᵒ ᵐᵉ ᵖˡˢ ?

I understand.
Is this his first short?
Wilbur Soot:
Looks like this anteater didn’t go to a place that gives FAST FOOD Lol
i like odd1sout shorts because he can upload more and they are funny
This video was originally 17 minutes long but due to you tube sensorship censorship was cut down to 15 seconds
Wow

“I understand.” Ant is so polite.
Haha I want wilbur to watch this

It’s been half an hour and I still don’t know how to tell about this

Well that was wired and random like me🙆‍♀️🙆‍♀️🙆‍♀️
Get ready for Wilbur Soot Vs. TheOdd1sOut
Anteaters are actually one of the deadliest animals
I remember this comic.
CAN WE GET THE ANIMATION AWARD FOR THIS MAN
James i love the shorts that you make, But it would be nice if you go back to full videos. And thanks for your time
Sad Anteater, we accept that you want to change your name :)
i was actually an anteater in one of my class's play [every class had to do the play from year/grade 2 to year/grade 6 i think] so yea.. awkward
. _ .
pogger ant
wtf
yes
relateable
U gonna make an actual video soon ?
Nice video but when are we getting another 10 munite one
Oh

"I understand*   * gets crushed between the teath of the anteater and dies *
Hi
why did i feel more non-binary when the ant said "Labels man" 😂🥰
dEEp
hes running out of ideas
That got dark real fast
i hate anteaters
Missed opportunity for "I underst-ant"
This has made my day better.
I’m super happy you’re back, man
Nice
*s l u r p s*
WILBUR SOOT is just like:
Ello
I love how the ant is literally just vibing instead of running for his life
Wilbur Soot doesn't approve of this video
Wilbur is disappointed
Man that's so nice.  One day I want to be a successful animator.  Just like you :)
He’s not dead...yet
I understand                     -Jerry the ant's last words
The ant is a legend
Hey james i hope you feel better and if im just being paranoid over nothing 🍑 yea im done
He is feeding us with good content regularly by shorts

Lol
I'm sad
Everyone, pay your respect to the ant o7
bruh
DONE MAKE SHOTS JUST MAKE A REAL VIDEO AND GET MORE MONEY
So why are you posting it on your main channel?   Well that affect your overall views for the future?   At least, that’s what I thought about how the algorithm works.

So wholesome
Wilbur Soot
Someone send it to Wilbur
So very polite Mr. ant!

Ik that no-one asked but please don't roast me XD but uh I love ants :)
Claim your ticket before this reaches 1m views
That was funny
Cute
Wilbur won’t be happy
Someone send this to Wilbur soot
Fun fact: Anteaters can kill jaguars with their claws! They are not to be messed with!
The last time James posted one of these I took his advice. I took a flight to Seattle and I said to the pilot, "I call shotgun!"  He said no  but at least he laughed
Suddenly, "shorts" are repeating on my device and after the 2nd, into the 3rd I realize the punchline just happened... 😅😆
Great short XD
It actually did NOT understand It understa'nt
Even in death that ants name will live on as the most respectful insect in the world
People call child yeeter but the police call me have the right to remain silent
Lol
HI
That was dark
Expectations suck
Why did a sad music play in my mind when an ant that I met for 10 sec dies
* flashbacks to wilbur listing too many reasons why he hates anteaters *
Just me who doesn’t get all these Wilbur jokes ?
Lol
At least humans don't eat ant... Oh wait
The video : i just don't like ants people just say that  Me :: oh my god really i never noticed
I hate ant eaters
Hi! *O K E H*
always misunderstood
I HATE ANTEATERS!!!!!!
no way noooooooooo
oh.
Anta e um animal do "Brazil" 💚💛
Sup
My MCYT addiction coming out when I instinctively scream 'DEATH FOR THE ANTEATERS' after rewatching Wilbur insult anteaters in multiple streams.
WHY U NO FUNNY NO MORE?!?!?
YOU LIKE ANTEATERS? WILBUR IS GONNA HAVE A WORD...
@wilbursoot
He is alive!
Lol
Wilbur soot?
Emotional blackmail
I hope he doesn’t just post shorts any more
I thought you died.  Not quite sure why.
I was planning on watching this and drawing dungeons and dragons monsters butt it was like 5 seconds long anyway...
Idk if i feel more bad for the ant or the anteater
If you willingly conform to those labels, won't that make you as bad as the one giving them? Always hated labels growing up.
✨Relatable Content✨
*Wilbur Soot has entered the chat*
Murder
Lol
can u make a shorts channel it would not take up as much time as ur main channel and we would still have your amazing content
This is on par with 6 yr old me making a monkey character that’s allergic to bananas cause I was so sick of that stereotype.
I like how your just making shorts
Depressing
UwU
Wilbur soot be like ... EeeEwWWw
I'm sorry my friend
Lmaoo I love this 😂
*Wilbur has entered the chat*

Anteaters Don't actually eat ants the munch on termites
👍 good Younis
who else feels like Youtube is your best friend during COVID now?
its guud don't get me wrong but I feel like u should do longer episodes of this or go back to what u normally do.If I running out of ideas ask the comment section for some
I can believe i thought anteaters likes to eat ants James thank you for teaching me a valuable lesson its more then school could ever teach me :)
Where’s the funny?
Such a polite ant. Might not be suicidal, but doesn't want to be rude either.
The ant willingly accepted death
.....hmmmm seems oddly familiar m8........I feel like I know someone who hates anteaters and rants about it every time someone mentions it......who could it be.....
The ant is into vore?
WilburSoot would hate this
HahahaaaahahhahahahhaaahahahahahhahahahahhahahahahhahahahahhahahahahahahhahahahahahahhahahahahhahahahahhahahahahahahhahaHahahaaaahahhahahahhaaahahahahahhahahahahhahahahahhahahahahhahahahahahahhahahahahahahhahahahahhahahahahhahahahahahahhahaHahahaaaahahhahahahhaaahahahahahhahahahahhahahahahhahahahahhahahahahahahhahahahahahahhahahahahhahahahahhahahahahahahhahaHahahaaaahahhahahahhaaahahahahahhahahahahhahahahahhahahahahhahahahahahahhahahahahahahhahahahahhahahahahhahahahahahahhahaHahahaaaahahhahahahhaaahahahahahhahahahahhahahahahhahahahahhahahahahahahhahahahahahahhahahahahhahahahahhahahahahahahhahaHahahaaaahahhahahahhaaahahahahahhahahahahhahahahahhahahahahhahahahahahahhahahahahahahhahahahahhahahahahhahahahahahahhahaHahahaaaahahhahahahhaaahahahahahhahahahahhahahahahhahahahahhahahahahahahhahahahahahahhahahahahhahahahahhahahahahahahhahaHahahaaaahahhahahahhaaahahahahahhahahahahhahahahahhahahahahhahahahahahahhahahahahahahhahahahahhahahahahhahahahahahahhahaHahahaaaahahhahahahhaaahahahahahhahahahahhahahahahhahahahahhahahahahahahhahahahahahahhahahahahhahahahahhahahahahahahhahaHahahaaaahahhahahahhaaahahahahahhahahahahhahahahahhahahahahhahahahahahahhahahahahahahhahahahahhahahahahhahahahahahahhahaHahahaaaahahhahahahhaaahahahahahhahahahahhahahahahhahahahahhahahahahahahhahahahahahahhahahahahhahahahahhahahahahahahhahaHahahaaaahahhahahahhaaahahahahahhahahahahhahahahahhahahahahhahahahahahahhahahahahahahhahahahahhahahahahhahahahahahahhahaHahahaaaahahhahahahhaaahahahahahhahahahahhahahahahhahahahahhahahahahahahhahahahahahahhahahahahhahahahahhahahahahahahhahaHahahaaaahahhahahahhaaahahahahahhahahahahhahahahahhahahahahhahahahahahahhahahahahahahhahahahahhahahahahhahahahahahahhahaHahahaaaahahhahahahhaaahahahahahhahahahahhahahahahhahahahahhahahahahahahhahahahahahahhahahahahhahahahahhahahahahahahhaha     Vore
I read "antTHEATRE" and was expecting something totally different.... heh..
I want real videos not shorts
A new pitch for a Netflix film,   ant eater no like ant?!!! society judges, not clickbate
The recipe of TheOdd1'sOut:  Humour:- 100tbl spoons Drawing skills:- 1 gallon Talent:- 2 gallons Haters:-(crickets chirp)  Mix then all together for 1hr, and also put a pinch of Morals every 2mins.  And like that,... THE LEGEND IS BORN
wilbur soot, where are u
I like how we get to see the anteaters pov. Lol
RIP
Anteater:  I don't want to eat you but I have no choice. Ant: Understandable have a great day.
Wholesone.
And what was the point of this video?
James I’ve been subscribed for a really long time even from my different accounts i just wish you would reply to my comment cuz u did to my cousins
This is darling!
Can you make a video
Father, I crave more
a
Oop
Can't say I'm first or anywhere near first, but within the 2000th comment!
amog us
dont let wilbur see this
Can we just take a moment and appreciate his politeness
Epic
Labels
Do a sequel or a series. the ant could still survive
Hi
Hes dead :(
What just happend
nice animation 👍  is funni
Women: omg how did he not cry to the titanic?. Do men even have even feelings? Men: nooooo ant
Someone should show Wilbursoot this through mediashare just to see his reaction.
Is this this furry vore, people are on about? Is it?
καλό
Lol
Question James, will you be at this VidCon? If you already didn't know this year's VidCon will be in California.
Next video: The life of A Soubway worker that hates eating subs
“I understand” -famous last words
The ant accepted his fate
Nice video dude!
The Ant-eater is like me... Ant-eater: I don't like eating ants *Proceeds to eat the ant* Me: I need to study man *Proceeds NOT to study*
having a deep talk with your food doesn't sound healthy... well at least he wasn't playing with his food... cause that would have been a more disturbing ending....
Lol
God : Let there be ants  Ants: cool, now let's go give back our pets we got during the pandemic once it is over.  God: Let there be ant eaters.
fuck this vertical aspect ratio
Keep making vids
Finally you made it short video
I thought it was anttheater
It would seem that since James may be taking longer breaks in between Storytime Uploads he is compensating us by crafting these Short Films to entertain us.   So we Vultures will not become Hangry. And tear you down as we so often do. People in your place are  Worshipped like Gods  Hated like Devils And treated like toys By the us unwashed Masses.
An anteater not eating ants is like a cat known for not eating mice
Don't recommend this to Wilbur soot
Rip ant he knew this was coming
The fact is that it's an accurate representation of today's world. The anteater feels forced to eat the ant when in reality they probably just want to be friends.
Ants are delicious tho 😯
One of the principalls brazil animal
Hah funy james and i love yo’re chanel
That ant is so understanding
No no no! You’ve got it all wrong! Anteaters are just giant ants that eat!
Small friendships in a nutshell.
Rest in Piece Ant, you were very polite and understanding.
Hi
I love your videos
James has way to much knowledge
this is so deep
I got here when it became exactly an hour ago
Can't you call Anteaters Aardvarks?
Nice
The ant was a good friend 😔✋🏾
James just admit your a furry.
plot twist. he just said that so the ant wouldnt run away
You've made 1 real video in the last 6 months, stop making shorts and make real videos
Ant and the Aardvark show was my childhood
e
This shii funny 🤣🤣🤣
Wilbur soot hates anteaters
Deep.
Hi
If you watch dream smp Wilbur would be mad because it’s a anteater
Hi I’m a really big fan
Idk if this is the best place to say it,but is jaiden dead?
For some reason i dont understand this
Anteater: I actually don’t like ants Wilbur Soot: I actually don’t like you
Wasnt this one of his comics?
1.5k comment
*sigh* I actually don’t like mechanical pencils  My entire school: *gasp*
So funny
I am what I am
Labels do indeed suck
So sad :(
Wow
Whaaaaaaaaaaaa
Rip ant died brave and kindly
IM EARLY!!!!!!!!!! 😂 😃
The poor ant wants to eat a cookie crum. And then R.I.P random ant
Ant was very optimistic. I agree with him "labels suck".
Wilbur Will Not Like To See This..
I've read this comic and I liked it
poor ant
;-; that poor ant
Lol
E
If I was an ant eater that would be something I would do
Watched this right after listening to Wilbur spot just shit talk anteaters
Poor ant
As he ate an ant with a cookie I’m going to dedicate to sell them :D        Get your cookie for free 🍪
Aww so respectful towards each other lmao!
Hate em
Yum
What
BRUH MY  MAN (i mean the one who named it as anteater)
Booooooooooooo  we need actual content booooooooo
God that escalated quickly.
me to i dont like ants to
Plot twist: The ant-eater found a copy of Sun Tzu's The Art of War and us relying on "all war is deception"
So clam about it 💓
Ohh so this is what happens in canada.
Oh no

Nope now you have to make another short of that ant alive in the anteater's stomach. They could both be friends. The ant is way too nice to die LOL
Glad he’s s back to making content
It'll be funny if the guy who voiced Bruce in family guy voices the anteater
Labeling is bad kids
WHY
When u cant question your role in society
Ayy uploaded on my birthday
I WILL NEVER LOOK AT THESE ANIMALS THE SAME WAY EVER AGAIN 🥲
Yay another Short!!! JAMES you should do this more often!!!
As soon as a watched this my dad came in and said we had ants in our garden.
"You can't tell someone you're going to eat them politely" anteater: Watch me
Becevote
This is"A Shark's Tale" in a nutshell
10 minutes ag!!
Anteater: Sorry force of habit
Wow just like that the 🐜 got eaten
This whole short/comic is cursed.

Anteater: “I don’t like eating ants..”  Iceland: “First time?”
Death: everyone says I’m the last person you see be for you die so sorry about this You: I understand

Hi
James' political commentary
This is so wholesome
Ye
I love ants
Sant
That's just how the cookie crumbles
*Wilbur Soot has entered the chat*
Bro imagine being so nice- *couldn’t be me*  Well it could be if we were talking about death
I might be wrong but I think the Anteater ment aunts like the ones in your family but he doesn't want to eat aunts but he likes actual ants
I hear you anteater
well that was weird
Y'all know Wilbur gonna come outa the ceiling being like 'HERES THE REST OF THE LIST OF WHY I HATE ANTEATERS PHIL! YOU THOUGHT IT STOPED? HA!'
F
The twist he actually likes ants and he just said that so the ant wouldn't bite/run
Anteaters are actually my favorite animals.
