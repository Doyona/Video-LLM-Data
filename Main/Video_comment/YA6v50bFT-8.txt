I have a question how was he able to give life to the branches at the end? Giving life to stuff isn’t one of Loki’s abilities to my knowledge
1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 is what I rate loki
Great explanation
I have both seasons of Loki on dvd at home to rewatch and critique lol. I really hope they do a season 3 ❤
Loved it. 9
If the marvels had a serious tone like this one it would've been great. I can't take that movie seriously, like every other scene there's got to be a joke or a banter. It's starting to get tired, loko and wandavision seriously has got to be the best when it comes to balancing things out
What i still cant seem to understand is how is loki going to live forever while keeping the multiverse alive with his power. Can he survive without anything because he's a god? Is he just going to stay sitting there FOREVER and just feeding the timelines with his energy and power? Its kind of confusing but I'm glad he didn't die again
It was crazy and sad Loki was a trickster before now he is he who remains holding the whole mcu on his back Sylvie Mobius and all those other characters r sad that he's gone as well as me I love Loki he went from being a varient that got captured to he who remains so sad now he is Loki god of story😢
Now if you like this you unlocked power to wach DARK gonna blow y mind
Hopefully it means there won’t be any more of this trash show.
Great writing loki series is best show
Madam Webb vives
Hell no. The Marvel MCU destroyed who Loki is, they didnt make him who he is "supposed to be" nope.  Imagine theyd do that with a Series about Jesus and completely change the outcome and purpose of his being. That would end in a massive SHITSTORM.  Don't just change the Story of religions just because it not cool enough and you want to make money out of it.  This shit ruined the image of my culture and religion and is nothing but a massive ball of shit.
salute to loki man
Who here cried?! Odin would’ve been so proud.
I think hes only the gof the failsafe timelines not the actual sacred timeline because kang was gonna let that die off anyway Loki is just keeping it alive
Why does breaking the temporal loom kill the other branches tho??
Many people are saying that Loki's ending was tragic. He went though all that character development and learned to love his friends, only to sacrifice that and be all alone in the end. He did need to go through that, though. He never would have chosen that path if he hadn't learned to care about others, so his character development was necessary.  What people don't see is that even more than having friends, what Loki has always desired most is to be important in some way. Good or evil doesn't even matter. Born with the belief that he is destined to be more important than anybody, darned if he wasn't right! He tried to accomplish that by taking power in various ways, trying to earn or trick his way onto a throne, but in the end, he finally achieved his heart's deepest desire. He is now literally the most imporant person in the multiverse, since none of us would exist without him. An oddly inside-out kind of happy ending, but there you go...  Even the fact that he has to give up his friends probably makes him feel important; a martyr who has sacrificed everything for the greater good. That's got to be infinitely satisfying, to know that because of him, everybody lives, and has the freedom to choose / fight, as his alternate Sylvie keeps saying. Of course he'd want that, as the god of Chaos. Just replace "chaos" with "freedom".
nothing exists unless observed : loki is now THEE obsever
He's the Watcher!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
What makes kang not start a new TVA?
Wait, so does this mean that loki became the one above all?
It’s crazy that he realized he was being selfish for not wanting to be alone, only to end up being alone to save everyone else.
Dont you guys think Thor would meet Loki again..What would happen after that?🥹
MCU at it's best
Only 6 episodes and somehow Loki clutched the MCU phase 4 popularity rate
So Loki is the most powerful God?
for once it seems they finally engineered their way to the end and not ruin it with cheesy over powering super heros
More like God of Everything 😂 wth
In the grand crescendo, the finale unfolded as the quintessence of artistry in storytelling. A tapestry woven with strands of suspense, tendrils of hope, and the delicate balance between a joyous yet melancholic conclusion. Within the confines of a single episode, perfection revealed itself, and my heart resonates with an adoration for such sublime narrative craftsmanship.
It's a shame that the team who wrote this would likely to get toss aside for disney to choose a more progressive-woke writers to handle the MCU. Lol
This also explains WHY Odin adopted Loki from the ice giants to be trained in the arts by his adopted mother. This  gave loki chances to be both evil and good , odin knew Loki becomes the tree of life . Loki had to compete with Thor seeing outcomes of both defeat , victory and pain to this final place of sacrifice.
Oh, i suspect that their war against kang was more successful than even the writers suspected. 🤔
Loki 🔥🔥🔥
Season 2 was an absolute 10. I was really on the fence with season 1, but the way they wrapped it up in season 2 was amazing. Best marvel series or movie since the infinity saga.
I’m not gonna lie I wanted him to off silve if that’s how u say her name and for he who remains to live he really wasn’t a bad guy ;-;
all 2 seasons were 10/10 💯, this is the seriousness & amazing story plots that we’ve been missing, no more marvel comedy films !
10/10
What bullshit. There is nothing in Norse mythology, nothing in Marvel comics, and certainly nothing in Disney's Loki that gives any indication that Loki can become Yggdrasill, or want to if he could. The character has been very well established to be an extreme narcissist mage capable of extremely convoluted plots and betrayals. He is not a hero and he can not turn into the world tree.  This is an example of the worse kind of scifi story. It doesn't remain true to the story and does not deal honestly with the audience's suspension of disbelief. The world of the story has to be consistent within itself, not pulling stuff out of the writer's derrière, especially not at the last minute.
Great episode, looking forward to what this brings for the future.
A great ending to this story but I do not think that this is the last time we will see Loki.
Ps 5 ❤
kang wanted Loki to take that place so that he can get out of his chair and go foor bigger things, that is why he gave Loki to time swap ability in 1st place
look story writer and kang himself confirm with huge demo of consciousnes that left woke based judgement will not lead to better ending of the world's . also woke do not see the bigger picture in the motion. I think reshoot of Loki season 2 was this main last 2-3 episode which will bring back our non woke Disney back.
This ending is so amazing... the best ever!
I actually hope they dont bring Loki back. This Series was PERFECT, perfect character development, perfect ending, everything. No need to ruin it by bringing Loki back
Right now, this is the only Marvel show/movie  I got excited for and I honestly enjoyd it very much
Loki will eventaully be able to be free he may channel himself to the varients of himself who knows?
It was amazing and mind blowing
He has become the One Above All
Crazy how Loki ended up being the center of everything!
I don't understand.  One of the choices was that Loki lets the thing explode, but the problem is that this will destroy the TVA and therefore the evil versions of Kahn will destroy the multiverse.  In the end he destroys the thing without letting it explode, the end?  Why should he hold anything?
Truly amazing series! LOVED it!
awesome series!
The best ending. Truly deserved by Tom
Loki season two was great. awesome ending
“Time can be rewritten”  “Not those times. Not one line. Don’t you dare.”
If MCU can create a story arc of Galactus or fantastic 4 in this kind of story telling then MCU will be back to its feet
Indeed... What a Finale!
If just Warren were a good student at school, he may have a real profession or job. Get back to school!!!
Loki is our savior now. He was the promised one
He LITERALLY turned the Temporal Loom into the World Tree Yggdrasil
How would this tie into Thanos killing him though? Was that just an illusion or another version of Loki in the multiverse?
This episode was insane! This season was insane!!!! I loved it so much. That conversation with Mobius at the end was so heavy. This was impressive through and through! Absolutely loved it!
Wait, so Loki is....everything, everywhere, all at once?
Why didn’t the radiation affect Loki?
Odin: "son are you winning?"   Loki "I am now a tree dad"😂
it probably took him way longer than a few centuries to learn how to control time,  because it took him  centuries to learn the physics, but probably more time past when he was trying to stop Sylvie
The most confusing part of the ending to me was, that the timeloom at its introduction, was introduced as a "Energy Generator" by harvesting energy of electrons through every timeline possible. Making the Timeloom the powersource for the TVA. But when the timeloom explodes when Loki destroyed it, it doesnt turn off all the lights in the TVA but somehow the timelines themselves die, which makes so f-ing sense. The Timeloom doesnt power the timelines, it powers the TVA, so why would the timelines die when the timeloom is destroyed (not explodes as designed mind you) and Loki having to step in.  Loki stepping in is also a huge issue for me, because at no point is it every explained what the hell he does and how it is even possible for Loki to power time itself through his, in comparison, carnaval magic. He isnt a god in the sense of the Multiverse, he is asgardian (ice giant really), the same as a normal human, his powers have nothing to do with time and even He who remains needs Tools to make time stop and change stuff, but Loki somehow does it just so? Makes no sense.
Why can’t lokis tva friends still visit him? Why not just enchant the purple thing again then go visit loki as he sits there forever lol, didnt they know the coordinates of that place? At the start of the season they go after sylvie but then just bomb all the timelines, but that still means they could’ve easily gone there
I wonder if Loki will be able to find a way to give the time lines life without having to hold them physically. It would be cool to see a Loki themed lair like He Who Remained had.
The end doesn't make munch sense to me. So loom the destroyed the, multiverse temporary but eventually it will come back with time.... So Loki can't just wait it up for the multiverse to recover? I guess he wants to save the TVA, but why he would care for that I don't know.
I think he became time.
Lokis arc is up there with darth vader very well written character
Loki wanted 2 things a throne (although by the end he didn't want it) and to not be alone. He got the throne at the expense of being alone only able to watch and not interact. Sad ending for Loki, kind of like the hero giving up everything but getting no recognition for it. For Loki's future - if the chaos / mischief side of him comes out he can wreak havoc across the multiverse. I believe this will happen in the future at some point. Thor and the Avengers having to save it with Loki as the ultimate ultimate villian.
It is really bittersweet that this version of Loki never got a final goodbye/farewell scene with Thor.
Literally holding the world in his hands.
It’s good
So The Hulk saved the entire multiverse cos he hated stairs.
Great job explaining everything.
I just wish we had any kind of explanation as to why loki wasn't spaghettified when he went out to the loom. It makes no sense what so ever when you actually take a second to think about it. Seems like doing that to Victor so many times was just unnecessary if loki could have just strolled down with no really issues.
loki is so nice now I kinda miss the mischievous loki
Loved this episode I was just smiling through out
This is how its done ...a cliche villain to the hero where he is the ONE WHO REMAINS and for whom other could live.. Brilliant character development... I mean he is indeed burdened
I like the character development of Loki and this season really shines that fact. In the end, he sacrifices himself to protect the multiverse and his friends. THE ENTIRE REASON THAT PEOPLE LIKE IRON MAN AND CAPTAIN AMERICA ARE GOOD IS BECAUSE OF SELF SACRIFICE. So giving Loki this attribute is kind of poetic in a way. It shows how far he has come as a character. Not an anti-hero anymore, but a hero for all
Does anyone else think in order for us to see loki again he could use one of his "holograms" to walk around the timelines🤔
Can you imagine if instead of the beyonders they put kan on their place 😳
Loookie 🥺❤️
Is it just me or does it make absolutely no sense
I think that when He Who Remains told Loki the loom was a failsafe, it wasn't just because of the sacred timeline, it was also a failsafe to prevent him from being killed too. Knowing what would happen, and that Loki would come back to prevent the destruction of everything, was also a prevailing factor.
great explanation 🌟
This definitely completed lokis unfinished character arc after his death in infinity war
Excellent summary! Thank you.
Loved the ending hoping that there will be a new season
I would love to win a PS5
If you go to Season 1 Episode 5, during the Loki fight scene with all the Loki variants, during the time stamp 20:28, You can hear a Loki variant scream "GLORIOUS PURPOSE."
I literally had to come here to understand everything..and now that i understand, everything makes a total senses..
Awesome videos been with you from the starts. Let’s go!!!!
Thats y time stone are green
The worst explanation ever
It's so amazing how Loki now has 2 character developments that ended so well.
"I'm a fast learner and a god . " CENTURIES LATER . xD
Love it!
Loki really carrying everyone. It was such a good series. Marvel needs to continue producing movies and shows like these ones. Both seasons were phenomenal.
Keeping in mind that the Loki that Thor knows and remembers died at the hands of Thanos. So Thor would have no idea that the Tree he was referring to in actually another version of his brother Loki. I wonder if Odin knows/knew.
Piderman & Batmen
I.   Loved it
I loved Loki and the finale was brilliant viewing
salam alakum
Let's speak about my lord and savior Loki
This is sad rlly and idk if anyone else is thinking this, but Loki still loses. Yes i know he holds the entire Multiverse and yes i know he did it for his friends and for the woman he loves which is himself. HOWEVER he holds it all together which means while everyone else has there freedom he doesn’t.  Yes everyone else has freedom but like The “Cosmic Wonder” said secret wars is still coming and variants of Kang figured out already hi to exist outside of time. However I don’t argue with the decision Loki has made. MULTIVERSE LOKI IS THE STRONGEST LOKI
Why did multiverse start dying! I don't get it, why does mutiverse always needs an keeper!
Wanna ask, what happens to Mobius stalking himself on that timeline? 2 Mobius in that timeline?
Loki can be the new head of marvel stories
I give it 10/10 It's the best MCU series thus far
This is a very creative twist on a hero/villain dynamic in that, as a Thor villain, Loki's ultimate victory is that he became a greater level of savior than Thor ever was.  Saving the multiverse >>> Saving the world/universe
I had a feeling that was supposed 2 be Yggdrasil at the end. Didn't realize they'd referenced that in the MCU already.
Friega and Odin are such proud parents watching over him! Odin saying" THATS MY BOY!! THATS MY SON!"
Wonderful video, I love the video and the series is extraordinary! 💚
Love this character in the mcu
I'm glad I watched this because I was so confused and now I understand definitely worth the subscription
Sup
Yes
Will Thor have his loki back ? Or its there gonna be a new hero gender reveal marvel character to replace loki ?
Loki Sea. 2/Ep.6 (Season Finale) was amazing! 10 out of 10!
Do you remember what color the Time Infinity Stone is? Loki actually became his embodiment. This is mind-blowing
Wow Loki has just become the most importent character of all of marvel I would say
I really enjoyed 😉 the Loki season 2..  I look forward to seeing Loki return in the Avengers Secret Wars. Have a great day Warren 😀.MCU rocks 🎥 😎 🙌 😍 😄 🪨.
0:15 "rate it 1 out of 10" 😂😂😂 I think you meant rate it "from 1 to 10" 😅😅
All the actors where brilliant love the show.
Loved 0 complaints i can't wait to see what are they going too do with this 😊😊
Question, so if Loki replaced He Who Remains, can Loki not operate the same way? By this I mean, sure he has to remain in the location he’s in, just like He Who Remains did, but can his friends not visit him? Remember how they were able to use a time door to send Renslayer and Miss Minutes to where the remains of He Who Remains were? Does that no longer apply? Is Loki choosing to have to hold up the branches? Can he not create his own version of a “Temporal Loom”? Because if he replaced Kang, how was Kang able to operate/exist in what seemed to be a more pleasurable way, outside of being alone?
Definitely 10/10.  Everything about this episode was perfectly done. The score, acting, writing, directing...everything.
Sory, still dont get it. I tried.
Ah… but did you all look closely at the tree??? Pause it. In the blue upper field smack in the middle, the branches make an A, an X & a 4. Potentially pointing to Blue Marvel as an Avenger (who technically defeated Galactus in comics), X men Blue Team and of course the classic FF Blue.   In the GREEN field below in the lower left if you blow it up, it looks VERY much like Groot as part of the Yggdrasil branches — that could be wild…. AND… on the lower right is an Angled D. In green. Doctor Doom. Take a look.
So cool
I really really liked the ending! I hope this wouldn't be the last time we'll be seeing Tom's Loki because we need him more than ever especially against Kang and his army of himself (also his reunion with Thor) ✊🏻🙏🏻
Favorite MCU show for sure
Lokis story was just amazing from start to end of Loki 2. He is the God of mischief and life! Loved it!
A great series, very consistent easy 10/10
the timelines looking like webs cant be a coincidence nor does him sitting like that kinda looks a little like maddame webb
The Loki show is a waste of loki.
What if loki needs to go to the bathroom😭
Hey look! Strand!
Great video
Amazing video of season 2 of Loki,fantastic job. 8/10.
So we're happy with Loki erasing season 2 and sacrificing himself for the multiverse? No flashbacks to his actual family, or his pre-TVA adventures, just inspiration from Sylvie (himself) and he goes out and does it. It feels so much less earned than his growth through phases 1-3. Plus turning him into the world tree just rings hollow.
Just wanna be able to play spider man 2💯💯💯💯
#1 marvel series
God of Stories Loki?
I loved this series. Can't wait for the Life of the Universe Loki Funko
I loved, loved, loved this 2nd season of Loki. It wasn't "fluff." The dialog deep, the cinematography was amazing, and the score was phenomenal. A standing ovation for all involved.
Nice recap after watching the last Episode i had some questins left but your recap answerd most of them so thanks and have a nice Day bye
I Rate it 8.5 out of 10!
What a show , best series that has came out for marvel !!
Loki "He Who Remains"
If only his family could see him now.  What a person he’s become
Loki's character build up was on God Mode
Was great to have a project that was about great acting, writing, producing and not about EDI, and yet the series had major EDI. It can be there without it being about it. Thanks for your great review of the episode.
Beautiful
You are literally my #1 source for Marvel news! Thank you for all you do!
Hope I win
Fantastic series
Killing Sylvie was never an option for Loki, I swear Marvel better let Loki see Sylvie and Mobius (in person)  again!!
Odin & Thpr can suck it, Loki just surpassed both of them. Loki is literally the ALL Father
I liked season 1 more... nothing was really that thrilling this season except the ending, season one was always thrilling from the moment they find Silvey for the first time
Still think the scarlet witch is more powerful than Loki as her prophecy was to enslave the multiverse while L;oki is kind of the slave of the multiverse
This show is definitely my new favorite, and I can't get enough. I really hope they make more stuff like this!
I'm so satisfied by this series
🤔
5:30 By Loki saying "Destroy the loom", HWR explained that by doing so, the war that can happen after that will destroy all of existence, including the Sacred Timeline. It wasn't initially an option because literally everyone will die. Not just his friends and the TVA. Which is what Loki did, except ofc, the plot twist happened. This is how he completely change the equation which is his initial plan.
When I watched Episode 6, I was thinking "Why do they have to KILL Sylvie? Why can't they just wipe her memory like they literally do to every Variant in the TVA? Seems simpler..." But then you explaining that letting He Who Remains live is also really really problematic, because he'll just control everything and take away freedom of choice. So, yeh this ending was probably the best outcome of this series. Pretty much the only choice Loki had..... god I looove his character arc... it's so crazy, and so awesome. Loki is my Number One MCU show, for sure!! Season 2 was soooo freakin cool :)
Possibly the perfect ending… I would be satisfied with the show ending here.
This finale answers the question.....why is there "Evil" in the world, the way, the truth, and the life. The Alpha and the Omega, The beginning and the End. This is the Esoteric ideology of God.
20/10 this show was incredible! Character development, script, editing, EVERYTHING! Why couldn't Secret Invasion have been like this?
I can't think of a better season finally of another show better than this one. Epic on every proportion
did the show well explained why he who remains do all the things？ what is his purpose？For the two options,  if Loki kills Sylvie, he who remains won't die and keep his job as usual,  if Loki does not kill Sylvie,  he know remains die and tva gone. So both two options doesn't benefit him.
Im glad I am not the only one that thought how INSANELY good the ending of S2 was!!! Goosebumps!
I loved Loki season 2, but the more I think about it.. if Loki could withstand the radiation, why didn't he try to fix the loom himself after spending centuries learning physics rather than sending Timely out. Also, why did Kang plan for Loki to come back and save him rather than just kill Slyvie?  But like I said, I love the storyline, and Loki finding his glorious purpose
I think you missed the most important part. He fulfilled the prediction that Mobeus made at the very beginning. He has to lose, so that everyone else can become who they were meant to be. Everyone else is saved, but he's trapped forever, holding the multiverse together.
I hope this brings the MCU out of the rut its been in..
Hw does it explain THANOS kiling LOKI..pls enlighten ME  Mcu FANS
Uh you f*cked this explanation up shockingly.
hey man explain the ending of the marvels
I would love to see Doctor stranges face when he sees Loki at the end of he time keeping the mutiverse going
I noticed a poetic moment from "Loki" Season 2 finale, comes when the titular god speaks with He Who Remains (Jonathan Majors). In a rather confounding moment for He Who Remains, Loki says, "We die with the dying. We're born with the dead." Those words come from a T.S. Eliot poem titled, "Four Quartets 4: Little Gidding." Overall, it's a melancholic poem ultimately about unifying the past, present, and future in order to find salvation. Once again, time comes into play, which is very much relevant throughout "Loki." And the poem foreshadows Loki's fate.  ....glorious purpose.....
10 / 10
I’m so lost… if Loki could go back in time multiple times to try to redo things he got wrong after they’ve already happened like fix the loom or stop Sylvie from killing He Who Remains, why couldn’t he just go back to 2012 and NOT escape with the tesseract… then none of the events of Loki would’ve happened and everything would’ve been fixed.. and can’t tell me that changing the past doesn’t change the future, because Loki went back multiple times in time to change the past in an attempt to change the future. He was unsuccessful but not because it wouldn’t work, but because he didn’t have the answers.
this is a hard thing to say…but the Loki redemption arch is just as good as Zuko from ALTA…this were some of the only characters that i felt something after their story 😅
This was crazy and a little confusing to be honest. But it was super entertaining and unique so I’m gonna give it a 8.5/10
3/10.  The only good thing about it is that Loki finally was able to live his life with glorious purpose.  Other than that, it was boring.  Glad they didn't write Majors out yet but it certainly has some of the seeds planted to be able to do so.
Loki is now as smart as iron man and as more powerful then the watchers
Loki is now the god of time
Well explained, thank you!
The only thing that can beat the experience of watching loki revolving in S2 is winning a PS5 or Xbox series X
I waited until after the last episode so that I binge it on Saturday. I rank this series up there with WandaVision. Simply a fantastic heroic arc for an antihero. Loved it.
Loki season 2 was great
Definitely 💯 a 10+❗️
It was a good episode bro
he who remians is still dead in the future
he who remains is gone yeahhhhhhhhhh and oh cryingggggggggg
I hope there’s isn’t a season 3. Let it end in perfection.
Series is 1 out if 10 Thought I missed sth but Loki is just the most powerful being in the multiverse without a real explanation. (Because he hat time)  The End so dumb.
I knew I’d like this show, but not as much I did. Such a great show overall
I like what the TVA has become. I hope this isnt the last of them, I hope to see more of OB and Mobius especially
Miss minutes surprised me, so is Miss Minutes essentially brand new with no memory?
The symbolism in the end, and watching it all glow green, knowing Loki is giving EVERYTHING life. Lokis came a long way, what an amazing arch
So, can we officially call it the Lokiverse now?
I was watching this part when Loki cut a whole in time, tell me why it looked like the stranger things portal 😭😂😂
Loki’s such a bada**. The sacrifice he made in the end hurt! Hope to see Loki again soon!
I hope we get to see Loki again. This character arch has been great, and he’s become one of my favorite MCU characters. Hope to see more of him
The Loki finale was such a great ending to an amazing show. Was there expecting to like this show so much
I remember watching season 1, I knew Sylvie shouldn’t have killed HWR. The way it was like and oroborus for season 2, and we were back at the season 1 finale! I loved it
Just a question, but if the only timeline left was the sacred timeline, in theory would that mean all kang variants would be dead besides nathaniel richards on earth?
10/10 finale! Loki was amazing
Thank you Cosmic Wonder for explaining all this for us. I couldn’t imagine how confused I’d be on all the time and time traveling without your videos
When Loki and HWR had their conversation, and finding out this is all apart of his plan, had me like “WHAAAT” 😂
Watching the montage, I was waiting for Loki to kill Sylvie. I really thought he was going to have to
The stakes in this episode had me on edge! Loved every minute of the show
Lokis character arch! The ending had me tearing me up, what a great ending
I hope this isnt the series finale, but it has ended in a great spot! I cant be mad if it is over
What an amazing show this has been!
Wow wow wow!! 10/10. Easily my favorite MCU Disney+ show now!
LoKi is WHO REMAINS
yes you definitely explained it better at least for me  and i watched it and i couldnt make sense of it lol
I need to watch this
Does anybody think that the fact that Thor has eternity in child form with him will somehow reunite Loki and Thor ?
I love it but I wanted no more action I rated it 8.5
Couldn’t this Loki go back in time and save the Loki that Thanos murdered? He could teach main timeline Loki how to make a 3 dimensional copy of himself in order to trick Thanos? Old Loki knew how to do it.
I love Loki ❤
I literally said it was interesting the branches formed a tree seeing as Loki is part of Norse Mythology although I had no idea the tree had a name. The last episode was awesome, especially with the logo playing backward. Just not sure how this will play out with Hiddleston claiming that’s the last time he’s playing Loki.
Didn't Kang give the Loki and Sylvia the option to run the TVA? If so isn't that what HWR wanted?
A lot of youtubers are missing the fact, that when he started grabbing timeline ropes, they get merged back together(branches are removed). Also, we know that incursions is also another way usiverses die. I guess Loki limited amount of base timelines(his power is not infinite and he can't save infinitely expanding multiverse), which is represented by trunk, but branches in the crone are expanding, maybe at that point differences in timeline are so big so incursions are not likely to occur.
Fantastic finale, a fantastic breakdown!
No, you’re missing the part that the option where he kills Sylvie isn’t just about killing her, it would mean allowing the tva to prune branched timeline to “protect what we can.” Loki didn’t want to be responsible for pruning branches and killing billions. The options were either everything dies including his friends or 90% dies but he still gets to keep some alive (also HWR wanted Loki to take his position, because HWR said he was tired of doing it- which would leave Loki alone and also responsible for 90% of the deaths.). Loki has had to deal with similar lose lose options before and he regretted them, which is why he tries so hard and comes up with his new option to sacrifice himself so that no one dies.
I’m Loki, God of _____ Son of ___
Should have killed that B
Loki 🐸
This will be the best 2nd season that marvel has made so far.😊
Loki is the goat 🥰
Indeed a Glorious Purpose. If Loki can't leave his thorn then, how come he will be in Secret War?
Been wondering why they introduce Spaghettification on this but non of the other series,if it’s this show specifically,or another reason?
Guys . The MCU was over after endgame. This show and that Wanda vision shit was ass. Just saying 💀🤣 and this shit is Garbo lol Loki is Loki not a savior of multiverse 🫠
Should've just killed Sylvie lol he barely even knew her
Well that ending sucked lol
0:15 Am I the only one who noticed him saying to rate it 1 out of 10 and not 1 to 10😂
I appreciate the explanation of the technicalities of the ending of Loki Season 2 finale. The details of the ending part was unclear to me. It was very enjoyable watching all the 12 episodes and I felt sad when it was confirmed that its gonna be the last. Also, when I watched Tom Hiddleston's interview about the final episode and said that it might be Loki's final appearance in the MCU, It's heartbreaking because he's been a part of MCU for more than a decade.    Once again thank you very much for the detailed explanation. I now know where to go if in case there are confusing scenes in the MCU. 🙂👍
Best show in marvel comics history period.
Loki is essentially The GOD. The comparison in story is unmistakable. He sacrificed himself for the sins of the world so that everyone may continue living.
-Scarlet Witch: * *powerful, can wrap reality and beat Doc Strange in a 1v1 fight* *  -Loki: " _Hold my Multiverse throne_ "
How Will he appear in any other films?
Just amazing
Definitely a 10!!!😃
Best marvel series 💚
Who would’ve thought that when the MCU started that Loki would have the most in depth and explored character arc ☠️ I’m not complaining though, I love it
❤
Glorious Purpose 🌳
10/10. Epic show loved every minute
So why is the multiverse still Colliding?
this is the MCU's version of God of Story Loki.
10 out of 10 episode
Loki is not giving the multiverse life. Stop. He has chosen to be the God of Stories, he is going to monitor all timelines and use the tva to hunt down kang variants. His solution is to replace He Who Remains, who would never do what Loki does and sacrifice his own freedom and take on partners/friends as equals.
Crazy ending
The actor for Kang is in a dispute atm. Might not get the kang dinasty after all
Hey man, thanks for the explanation because I was surely lost. It makes sense now.
Let me win. Lol.
What a series.. no dull moments on this one.
I mean he who remains did say he wanted either Loki’s or Sylvie to take his place. Which is exactly what happens.
Let’s hear it
What if he need to go to the toilet?
So loki wont return in any movie now
Wait why does Loki need to keep the timelines alive? The timelines survived before Kang made the loop. Now they need a power source?
Thought he’d end up with Sylvie smh 😢
I dont know what's gonna happen with Jonathan Majors but here he delivered. He Who Remains is a phenomenal b*tch. Every scene he is in with Tom is just 🤌
Its like idrecel and the watcher combined to make there own meaning of the god of stories
Beautiful
5:08 Wait, but theres an infinite number of branching timelines and the TVA used to deal with these just fine.  Just....do the same thing but for he who remains variants specifically? They literally end up doing this in the end?
Thanks for that, finally got around to wrapping up season 2 and this breakdown was great 💯
Without dieing heade a scene just as ironman in endgame maybe deeper
I liked this show. I do find it fascinating that people are so awed and fascinated by Loki making the ultimate sacrifice to save those he loved and becoming “savior” of the multiverse but that’s EXACTLY what Jesus Christ (who is the one true God) did and then some!
Odin will be proud of Loki
The beautiful part of that episode was Loki's creation of the multiverse Yggdrasil. I watched every episode, and this one, by far, was most interesting with a beautiful ending with a wonderful symbol, the Yggdrasil. Loki learns valuable lessons and learns the value of life. I enjoyed every minute.
I still don't understand if all the Kang variants are from different branched timelines of one and only one universe or are they from different universes. Or are the branched timelines and the multiverse the same thing in MCU? I don't think both are the same thing because The Spider Verse and the Doctor Strange 2 movies showed us different universes that are very different to be considered branched timelines of any one universe and so, my doubt remains the same, are all the Kang variants are from different branched timelines of one and only one universe or are they from different universes?
What a way for Marvel to redeem themselves. I thought the last few Marvel films were boring and dull. This is exactly what Marvel fans  needed! This show was well written and directed. The season finale was the best I’ve seen in a while.
How can loki provide life to timelines ..... Its not his powers or his time slipping powers... How how.......!??????
Shame he's said he's finished with Marvel and Loki
What happened to TVA Victor Timely when Loki step out and became the multiverse? I know we see you Victor not getting the book, but the TVA variant still exists right? Because the TVA variants of the other people still did because Mobius went down to watch himself right? Just confused :P
leave a comment down below
Am I the only one who didn’t like the finale. Loki becoming the God of Story should’ve came after Kang dynasty and Secret wars.
what a journey for this character, simply amazing!
Naming the finale "Glorious Purpose" was soo poetic.
🆗️🆒️🎯📽
Something is missing. In Season 1, He Who Remains says he wants to retire and give the seat up to someone else. So he didn't go through all that trouble to get a version of Loki to the end of time so He Who Remains can keep ruling. Likely He Who Remains couldn't think of a good way other than the sacred timeline method that can stop other bad versions of himself while keeping himself alive. He Who Remains wants Loki to take over and preferably himself not dying and retire. Loki found a way that keeps the multiverse, keep his friends alive, but have to be alone by himself while He Who Remains remain dead.   What Loki could have done is to try out killing Sylvie and try out that reality and compared to the Time God ending to see which one is better. Because he can time slip, he can technically go back and change his mind if after many many millenniums holding on to branches, Loki gets tired like He Who Remains.
So he’s gonna sit there… FOREVER?
So basically he's doing what he who remains ask him and sylvie to do in the first place.  He said you two run the place.
im new here but love how much you pull from comics
Loki god of the multiverse, Thor trying to duck his hammer and Odin was like yes Thor is worthy to be King of Asgard 😂
Loki top tier show 9 out of 10 just because there isn't more
Loki He Who Remains, Loki He Who Become the Heart of Yggdrasil, Omnipotent, Omniscient, Omnipresent, God of Multiverse, God of Time, God of all Gods, All-father.
10
Best explanation thank u
If Loki can duplicate himself does he need to stay there for eternity? If he could make multiple duplicates couldn’t they grab multiple branches and prevent Kang?
The moment he declared he wanted no throne, he became worthy of the most important one.
glorious purpose
Loki looks like Spiderman holding everything together with webs lol
in the end, instead of pruning the branches, he's grafting them.
Loki the giant. Not God 😂  ~Odin
Who else was confused and came here
i am sooooooooooooooo sad that Loki will never return
Loki huh... Daym
😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
I want ps5
Nicee!
This finale was amazing for so many reasons. Loki has gone from an average pantomime villain to the best character in the MCU
Bravo MCU
This was definitely an interesting series for Disney+ , I wanted to know what happened to Loki and this movie is perfect
Thanks for explaining so well
Mah boi Loki was like “loser?” Nah nah! I will succeed! Becomes a true god and the fabric that holds all time and space together. Nice. 👍🏽
Its was a 8.5 and not a 10 only because I wanted a seemingly happier ending for Loki. I know I'm a sucker.
3000/10
Jormugandr, the giant serpent
A truly stunning ending - extremely well executed! - Looking forward to everything else we're yet to see from Marvel over this next season of content! ♥
Yggdrasil was a nice touch
Wow, what an emotional rollercoaster. An epic finale and such a bittersweet ending. Loki tried so so hard to save everyone and all his friends. He said last episode he didn't want to be alone but in the end sacrificed his ability to be with them, to save them.
So Loki did what Eren couldn't :)
Loki is the best marvel project currently. So good.
Loki got promoted to the position of god of time and thor got promoted to the position of god of comedy.
I never expected Loki would turn out to be this changed... 😢
Questions  does that make loki the watcher ??
What a marvelous finale
There is a type of story that touches my heart more than any other: you may start off on the wrong path, but you can change and do better. Loki going from the attempted enslaver of earth to the giver of free will to all existence is the most amazing progression and demonstration of this story arc that I can think of. It brought me to tears. The greatest hero in the MCU was once its greatest villain. This is just so powerful to me.
It's sad to realise that it's the end of this show
I cried so much at the finale. I adore Loki and he has always been my favourite character and the ending was perfect but I'm so sad that we probably won't see him again in the MCU. It feels like he has died all over again.
Why no review of the marvels from your side warren
Loki is coming back in Deadpool 3!
Crucial clarification of options given.
I’m thinking Loki will lose to a Kang at some point. It seems to me that this season showed it’s a loop of events that occurs. He Who Remains wanted Loki’s pruned probably because it would lead to this. I think He Who Remains wanted Loki to destroy the fail safe because then that will start the multiverse war that He Who Remains needed to happen to become He Who Remains.
Why haven’t you talked about the marvels yet
so noone is talking about the problem mobius mentioned kang variant made some problems in 616 but they took care about it ????????
When they zoom out from the new multiverse or Yggdrasil, when camera rotated clockwise, it felt like they were comparing it to turning over an hourglass. As if it is the beginning of a new age or "time".
loki szn 1 & 2 chefs kiss
If the loom was meant to preserve the sacred timeline why did slyvie say there was no where left to go. Couldn’t they just gone there theoretically? Plot I’m sure .
But why did the time branches start to die when Loki destroyed the time loom? Is it because variants of Kang started another multiversal war that started to destroy all of existence?
"Time is an illusion." and it's beautiful to see that the character who creates illusions now controls time. So that was character development at its finest. And I found it funny that he always wanted the throne and now he's firmly attached to one. It's interesting to see his wish come true, but it comes with enormous responsibility. Sensational series finale. I hope Marvel continues to build their movies so well after the low point of the last few years.
Incredible series!! Loved both seasons and Loki's character development is in my eyes the best the MCU has done!  Im still hoping to see him reunited with Thor in some way. I've always felt his last words to Thor in Endgame would be how his...and Thor's characters could bow out of the MCU....with the sun shining on them once again ❤
Awesome 👌
How is he providing life though? Still confused.
Kratos would be Proud 😭🤣
Now he is the all powerful one...
I loved it. It was basically the plot of Groundhog Day.
Am I the only one hoping that this will not be the last time we will see loki in MCU? XD
Easily one of the best things Marvel has produced in years, who would've guessed it was a show featuring Loki. I never really liked him as a character, but this Loki has been the most insane character development. I hope we will see him again at some point. And I hope his back will be okay after carrying the MCU like this.
So... Loki season 2 happens before What if and Antman 3 ???
11 out of 10
Tom hiddleston was on Jimmy Fallons Tonight show and said that the season finale for Loki is also his Final apparence as Loki. that is he closing the book of him being Loki after 14 years of portraying the character.
ps5 pleasseeeeeeeeeeeeee
What is idraells relationship to eon? And is the seventh infinity stone  (singenter )going to be introduced?
Burdened with Glorious purpose came true
This show was epic
WHAT A F***ING SHOW 10/10 👏👏👏
Loki character arc was 🔥
I think Kang wanted him to do this. Quantum physics suggests that all time, all worlds repeat all at once over n over. Being outside of time, (time is a concept so we no when to go to work) is irrelevant. All of this will repeat, Loki didn’t change anything. Kang knows Loki is attached to these pple bc, the character has no friends until this season. The best person for kang to do his bidding without Loki knowing. That’s my hypothesis lol, I have no idea. N even Kang didn’t pave this, the infinite universe did.
good finale :)
Then what happened with the timelines after loki's death.
Kang is in the 4th/5th dimension. Wouldn’t he know that Loki does this? He’s seen all possibilities.
So Tony could easily come back
I think any version of Loki that we see will be the less powerful variant versions.   That would open the door for a third season.
Tom Hiddleston said he’s done with the character which means Loki will be recast probably as an old man
if tva is trying to stop kang variants how did the council of kangs at the end of quantumania appear
Thanks, I saw already many videos aboout this incredible series finale but yours was really helping to understand the power Loki has on the timelines, he gives them life. So sad, he is there alone.. Thanks!
Similar to Loki learning how to control his time-slipping, now he will also learn how to control timeline branches now that he's the one keeping it. We will see and wait what might be Loki's role on multiversal war in the future.
9/10  Loki is easily one of the best Mcu Disney Plus series , BITE ME AND FIGHT ME!
One of the worst series finale 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
does loki then get killed by thanos still ?
I need a PS5
Loki saved all the timelines
Second season was extremely boring! I watched for the sake of the character and Tom Hiddleston. Who wrote this anyway? Remember the first time he started time-slipping? He didn't slip back into his own body then; there were literally two Loki's in the elevator scene where one pruned the other!
So Loki became "He who remains"?
This season of Loki is one of the best things marvel has put out in recent years absolutely loved it!
PS5 giveaway! 🫶🏻
Hello I like your videos
1. If there was time before He who remains, how did the timeline survive. The timeline is dead right away when loki destroyed the temporal loom, what is happening here? I can't understand how it works.  2. HWR told us that he will return to his throne no matter what, making this an endless loop, since loki broke that loop does that mean loki is bound to the HWR position for eternity now?
One of my biggest issues with this is that a LOKI should’ve just had Sylvie read his mind, and then she would’ve saw everything that was gonna happen.
Incredible ending to the best MCU show ever!!! Loved it. My theory of OB secretly being the Beyonder did not cone true though. I absolutely love the finale. What a fitting ending to Loki's quest. Awesome video Warren. I watch you channel everyday. Keep it coming. Woof woof
I win
From "Loki the God of Mischief" To "Loki the God of Stories."
I feel like secret wars should be split into two parts, kind of infinity war and endgame
This series is so well written. Absolutely phenomenal. Hardcore finally. Outstanding.
The Loki series in general is a 1000000/10
This finale was really good but is loki gone now
That’s ridiculous
Best series from marvel yet
Loki is the next god of "MULTIVERSE"!!
I like the fact that you said that "Loki loves Sylvie, which is himself." Because it fits his personality of being a narcissist 😂😂
Damn
The best mcu series without any doubt
Marvel is back!
The best finale of anything out there. It's so good, and Tom Hiddelston was so good in the episode!
niiiice video
One important thing i think people are missing- besides 'life' loki is mostly preventing the 'infinite branching/duplicating' that timely mentioned; By holding then all at the center of the now 'tree' hes mantaining a stable and finite multiverse. That part i like. The whole giving life to timelines tough i didnt... why is that even needed, arent the universe/multiverse supposed to naturally exist multiplying without an artificial energy source? The end is beautiful and i mostly commend these writers(way above most of marvel writers)  BUT it leaves/makes big holes in plot logic putting form over function(and logic)- so in the end he suddenly have more magic powers then he ever did(or if he did he never used then?), he can now walk there without a suit because... he wills it that much(?)... then his cape is turning into branches, again because whatever...
Best marvel series of all time
It gave me chills when it zoomed out, is it yggdrasil? Then boom, it is the great world tree.
Loki become a tree of life -Yggdrasil so beautifull
They really need to capitalize off this finale and build up Kang as a villain because this episode gave him a good ground to step on moving forward
i felt that you really could only watch the first 2 episodes and the last one and call it a day.....
Zzzzzzzzzxx Marvel sucks
Love your channel! Thank you for content and dedication to us fans🤙🏽😊
I'm still confuse on why loki haven't got a game yet it would be so cool too see loki go thru different time lines defeating different version of him or mcu villains trying to change time come on guys make it happen have the creators of spider man 2 ps5 game
Loki is keeping the MCU alive, and Loki is really keeping the whole MCU alive.
Loki is not the vid of stories people need to research, if that was the case he’d simply rewrite everything ala he who remains, when in fact he’s just allowing free will so everyone can see where things land.
The ending was the greatest ending in MCU history since Iron Man snapped.
It was a great story and great acting too. I loved this. Gave me the same feeling as Andor. It was great. Perfect ending, from his intro to the end, it was a perfect circle.
Loki🔥🔥
So loki is one above all?
I was really very satisfied with the ending - not a typical MCU-Show, but really unique. In the future it will be seen as masterpiece, I guess. Not all episodes were that brilliant, but the second season should be binged in a row. Then it will be more satisfying. After all LOKI IS THE KIND OF GOD HE WANTS TO BE. He is the core of YGGRASIL. He is controlling the NEXUS of all realities. Woof woof (back)
Can someone explain why did all timelines die out when temporal loom was destroyed?
Loki was right all along , he was burdened with glorious purpose. The show was not only brilliant but one of the best things to come out of the whole MCU.
such a good finale
The last episode was awesome
loki is OP, more powerful than wanda?
Great series! Hope to see more Loki! Also do you think Doctor Strange knows what’s going on? Could we possibly see Dr. Strange help Loki make something?
Personally I found this season really boring and confusing from episode 1-4 tbh but episodes 5 and 6 were INCREDIBLE!
Looking forward to the kang dynasty.
This loki show is holding the mcu together.....hahaha get it😅
Loki's character development is really what makes Loki series golden. I mean, HE DID ALL THAT TO SAVE HIS FRIENDSS!!! From being obsessed and stealing the Tesseract, to being the "life" of the yggdrasil... Just, wow.
Hands down the best thing anything Marvel has done. Im in awe! This episode elevated the comic genre now in my opinion cause it truly was a spectacle. This also proofs to me that with the right writers, the MCU is still at its peak. Cause like i said, its the best thing marvel has EVER produced. Im not even trying to exaggerate that, but it truly is. You dont need cameos galore to please fans. You just need a compeeling story that satisfies the fans. And this absolutely outdid itself. This episode alone has cemented itself as probably the greatest episode on television. Again, sounds like an exaggeration which it probably is, but to me its true. I cannot think of a single show that ive watched that has a finale be the best of the show. Most shows falls off the cliff when it comes to the finale and doesnt stick the landing but THIS?!?! it landed on every surface of the earth! I still cant wrap my head around how good this was.
Nice explanation
I gave it a standing ovation while crying my eyes out
☄️
I have been checking different videos but this is the best summary yet. But I  have a question. Are new timelines still getting created? If they are wont they eventually become too powerful for Loki to power?
Loki is god now in the mcu
He who remains really surprised me this episode. It seems like there’s another version of him that might be still alive.
Why the TIME STONE IS GREEN? time portals and timelines are orange... its Loki, its allways been Loki.
La fin était magnifique et émouvante 🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹
So is Loki the most powerful character in MCU now?
10/10, great ending, even tho I was a little confused in the end. but those are the best endings
Is he now not only tye God of Stories but now the God of Time??? And when the war with the Kangs come, will he be the first ot last defense???
Loki just “Lucy’ed“ iyk what im tryna say…. got the same “i am everywhere” feeling in the end.
DAMNNNN
I Missed The Giveaway so what
“A king never seeks war, but he must always be ready for it” - Odin, to Loki and Thor. Loki now sits on a throne, and the TVA works to prevent a multiverse war.
Wait...so the whole multiverse is saved all because they made Hulk take the stairs?
What an amazing finale. This series is by far the best marvel series in Disney+. Thanks for the breakdown.
This is the type of story building scarlet witch deserved as well
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
When Loki 1st touched down on Earth in the 1st "Avengers" movie, he told Nick Fury that he, Loki, has a glorious purpose. THIS completes the loop: from 1st "Avengers", to "Loki" S1 Ep 1, through to "Loki" S2 Ep6.
Is there season 3 or its the end?😢
Thank you for explaining it. Great character development and in this saturated time for marvel loki is definitely the one who holds it together. From a spoiled brat to the merciful god of multiverse who just wanted to be equal, with his brother. Wow what a journey, i wish thor could see him now and hope they will reunite in avengers films. I am just curious if universal war will happen cuz it seems to me they dont wanna jonathan myers back as kang even though he should be back and he is amazing as kang.
This season was 10/10
It's great to watch a show and actually get hit with an ending that not only did you or anyone see coming, but it ended the show in such a perfect way.  I believe we get to see so many different versions of Tom's Loki over the last 14 years, such an amazing range . It's probably the best character growth in the MCU . So if this is Tom's last time as Loki, then he took a character that was probably 2 or 3  movie appearance  villain and turned him into one bound for Glorious Purpose.  Thanks, Tom, for 14 years of Loki
Love this season finale!! Love the Loki series!!! The ''oroborus'' - the snake biting its own tale;  is called Midgardsormen/Miðgarðsormr , in norrøn mythology. This enormous snake is laying around the world of the people (the world in the middle of the 9 realms) between Gudeheimen and Jotunheimen. Aaaand, Loke is also the father of Midgardsormen! This season finale was so beautiful, and to see Loki coming back to his roots, all grown n grounded!!
what a phenomenal ending to an absolutely awesome series i just hoped this would  never end as loki became my favorited character outside spiderman since the first season but the conclusion was to me justified. they essentially did the ORV ending for those who dont know the mc of ORV sacrifice 51% of himself to save the multiverse while his friends tries desperately to bring him back to them but too no avail. a very sad ending for the friends but hey at least the world is not destroying themselves amirite
But is he now the god of the multiverse or of All the timelines of one universe. I think things got messed up because another universe isnt another timeline. One universe has infinte timelines.
Instead of becoming the king of Asgard he became the king of multiverse
So Loki can now wield the hammer
Now he is the God if Multi verse 😍🥰
10 ... this proves you don't need a 100 million dollar budget to have a great show.   A great story & actors can go a long way
So has loki then become “the one above all”?
The true God of Stories
This show had Glorious Purpose
Maybe Loki can send multiple duplicates of him to any branch now
definitely 10/10, best marvel series after stage 3 so far
One of the greatest marvel series
Best mcu show ever 🔥10/10
Loki was a great show ……. XBOX SOUNDS GOOD 😊
what will happen to He Who Remains if Loki becomes someone who has control over the multiverse?
Great explanation 😊
Season was good but this was GREAT! just might of topped Wanda vision for MCU shows in my opinion
Someone said the Time Stone is Green because of Loki
Lets gooooo
Marvel/Disney really stepped up their game with this series. A proper send off for an amazing character. Hopefully Loki and Thor will meet up again somehow, someway.
Can he use this situation against the Council of Kangs
I would’ve just killed Sylvie
10/10 the best Loki episode EVER, but I am sad Loki is over now
♾/10 - This series was such a relief. Almost everything after End Game was unbearable!
pls note that this Loki is the Loki from first avenger movie, which Loki is waging war for a throne, for acknowledgement from his father and the universe as benevolent god, for proving to himself that he's different from his biological dad. in the end of his redeeming journey he got it all, a throne, became the god that guard the universe, let alone became the universe itself, and proved himself that he's benevolent god burdened with glorious purpose.
No words for describing this series. One of the best series ever and the sole Marvel is Marvel Phase 4.
Mad
Best story ever told this is why loki has always been my fav!! Hands down phenomal story!!
Was this the end of the series? Or is there going to be a new season? 😮
So in this Loki's choice, all his friends is going to die because Who he remains' variant will come and kill them all in every timeline, but they got free will? Is that right?
The ending was too good
It was way better than the marvels
This episode was a literal goosebumps.
Easiest explanation Loki is replaced loom to prune and limit kang varients , loki is he who remains .
YOU ARE WRONG WARREN. Loki is only overseeing alternate timelines.
a
Masterpiece
Subscribed , now give me my PlayStation 😂🤭
Congrats on trending
i havent cried about a marvel series/movie in a while and this season really broke me in the best way possible, loki found his family but to save them.. he sacrificed himself? the complete 180 since season 1 episode 1 is insane
I want the X-box/Ps5
Homie got his throne the right way fr fr
Damn the finale showed the true power of not any character but of the writer!
How does Loki scratch his bacck if both his hands are busying holding time branches?
Loki replace rdj literally in every way 💔 miss you
You know if you think about it, Loki and He Who Remains are in an endless loop of existence. Loki saves the multiverse from destruction by preserving their timelines and keeps the multiverse from being destroyed by the TVA trying to preserve the sacred timeline and He Who Remains destroying the multiverse after the multiversal war and keeping one universe alive and creating the TVA to preserve the single universe to prevent more of himself from existing and destroying the universe all while simultaneously waiting for the arrival of Loki to the TVA so that the universe won’t suffer the consequences from when he dies. Loki is the beginning while He Who Remains is the end, they are the true Ouroboros and He Who Remains’ name is telling if you figure out that it is fully He Who Remains from the Original Multiverse.   I also think this means the MCU’s multiverse is far more different than the comics multiverse and quite possibly that the comics multiverse was destroyed and Loki was the only one who survived so he recreated the multiverse the best he could with the memories of the people he had encountered before and how they acted and made that multiverse, but he was now trapped in an eternal cycle with He Who Remains or one of the many Kang variants. Because from what I read on the Marvel Wiki page, the comics multiverse was created by these bunch of characters that I don’t even know what were called that created a universe that then rebelled against them and the multiverse was created from there with the original creators doing an occasional wipe of the multiverses so that the characters don’t spiral into chaos and destroy everything. Just theorising here.
10
It was  perfect
yesssir
I still feel bad that in order for Loki to find his Glorious Purpose, he’s burdened to be alone for all time. I loved seeing him become a Hero tho. His rage & jealousy/envy of Thor was always at the root of his actions & felt like there was always hope for him to right his wrongs. I loved how this season made the stakes feel so high with so little going on. It was so dope to see the loom actually appear to be the Tree of Life. That was when you knew, that was what Loki was destined to do/become… Hope we get Loki back, after the Kangs are defeated   Also, why do y’all think they made it a point to show RenSlayer noticing that Pyramid? Maybe Rama Tut will be the next Variant that pops up in a movie &/or Renslayer is also from that time period & doesn’t know it. It’d explain why HWR didn’t treat her like he truly loved her. Just a thought/theory   Woof WOOF
the show was really good 10 on 10
So dude is stock in a chair till the end of time
One of the best things Marvel have done. PEriod. Not just recently, but ever. This is the MARVEL I want to watch .
Loki's character finally got what it deserved thanks to the superb acting by Tom Hiddleston...This series will probable change everything in MCU 👏
But what was in place of the loom before whe who remains built it or took control of it?
From God of Mischief to Idrasil, the keeper of the Multiverse   Thank you Warren I had trouble with the ending at first, but I understand it all now  Woof Woof!!
He out loki in the spot to free up his own time to remain above all. It's his plan.
Loki is a superhero stories that relates to normality of life. Normal office/work/casual attire rather than wearing superhero suit. And problem solving theme.
Thank you so much 💓 for this
9:09 he’s not replacing he who remains. He who remains created the TVA, which just eliminates branches, and creates one single sacred timeline. Loki is basically strapping himself to the infinite amount of timelines, and using his life source, which is apparently immortal, to generate them continuously and keep everything from dying and going up into strings and noodles. Kang didn’t do any of that.
When I watched this series, I was thinking, "Holly Molly! My inner child thought about Loki the Chronomancer 10 years ago becoming real!!" 😮
8:11 and then Loki pulls a Jesus Christ, and sacrifices himself to save everyone.
3:00 why are we getting told everything we already saw? We watch the episode that’s why we’re here.
1:23 he wasn’t trying to understand physics he was trying to understand engineering.
Finally he sat on a throne and he is the most imp of the MCU universe now. The best TV series ever produced.
My question is, how does this channels provider even know what happened? He must be one of Kevin’s writers, because I feel like the secret could only be deep in comic lore and then you have to know a good amount of science and/or science fiction. How old is this person that much experience they have all this crap?
It's so bizarre that the best episode of any Marvel series comes out right at the same time as the Marvels, one of their worst movies ever. That's Marvel's  biggest problem, quality and consistency is all over the place. And Disney's greed, hubris, and poor management is to blame for that.
he the time stone wandas the reality stone
LOKI !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I remember him scaring little me in Avengers one and I did not like him now he has become my one fav characters
Loki stopping Sylvies time was OP!!!
Absolutely amazing show Loki did not disappoint
perfectly explained, thankyou so much <3
I just watched the finale. OMG I love marvel
best plot, creme de la creme
Impressive how they developed Loki as a character in this series. The ending sequence of this episode was the EPIC.
I think the "replacing" is definitely foreshadowing the "big reset" that Kevin Feige was teasing would result from Avengers: Secret Wars. And with the MCU incorporating the Sony Spider-Man movies and the Fox X-Men series into its multiverse, this "reset" could ultimately be those universes merging, replacing those separate universes with one single universe where The Avengers, the X-Men (including Deadpool) and Norman Osborn/Oscorp all exist together in some fashion when it's all over.
Heavy is the head that wears the crown
Now that's expert writing 💯
Yo, I can’t say how much I love the finale for season two of Loki like literally they went out with a banger
Loki became the king and ruler he always wanted to be... just not in the way he wanted. His throne is his prison.
I kinda feel bad for Loki at the end of this series.....
just watched the Loki Season 2 finale oh that was so good I felt like I was watching a movie this made me feel something I haven't felt when watching a movie in a long time it made me want more it made me want to see what happens next it felt like the way movies used to be this was so good I loved it it's almost nostalgic to feel this feeling again it's been too long it made me feel excited for Marvel again man, if only they did more of this this is what the other Disney+ shows SHOULD be and what the movies should be this was as good as a movie just story and character I actually feel kinda bad for Marvel now if they can do more of this then it'd be sad to see them not be able to see it through
So happy how this series finale and so happy for hiw "Deadpool 3" will set up "Avengers: The Kang Dynasty" and "Avengers: Secret Wars" before six soft reboots the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) as a whole and give us a new Marvel Universe here with "ALL" the superhero teams to co-exist with each other altogether
Its been a while i enjoyed a superhero movie this much! Finally thank you MCU for delivering an awesome story after a long time since No way home ig
Loki becoming apart of a multiverse is pretty silly because they made him a Cosmic being because reasons. He got connected to time and then just somehow becomes a Cosmic being yeah okay... Pretty lame story ending which makes no sense at all.  He's a Frost Giant and somehow becomes this powerful being because plot hole.   Wish they would bring up something like the Nexus of Realities that holds the entire Multiverse together but instead we get Loki becoming a Cosmic being because plot hole.
GLORIOUS PURPOSE! I concur with the rest, 10/10. Absolutely spectacular!
Woo
Dope season finale.  great explanation. 👍
Wait so if he destroys the loom the only consequence is the end of the TVA?
10/10 MCU Disney plus show best finale.
The ending was crazzyyyyyyy
I love how throughout the series he literally gets all the powers of the infinity stones
PS5
All hail Loki the God of Stories.
this is so SADDD but so good serie
Idk what y’all are smoking but people saying season 2 was better than 1, y’all trippin. All that money Disney has and I feel like we’re stuck on the same set 5/6 of the episodes. Those long drawn out scenes was Disney shortening run-time to save money…Disney went cheap AF on production. Sooooo much more could’ve happened in this series. Like I enjoyed it but felt as if I was robbed of a great conclusion to the best thing marvels done since endgame…
So Loki basically became The One Above All right after 'defeating' He who remains XD
Amazing show!
Awesome finale!
Dr Strange Supreme  And Now  Loki ( variant of Earth 616 loki ) Are most powerful beings of all times
i was in tears.... i knew loki will do somthing imazing... like Professor Severus Snape.. this 2 character are my fav.
A 12. Absolutely incredible, very satisfying, but also sad. Some questions I had from the outset was why the loom was instrumental to the multiverse, when the multiverse must have existed before its creation. It seemed fairly obvious that the problem was the loom itself, but I assumed I was missing something and was wrong. Then Mobius whole story about the kid that would grow up to be a killer missed the mark with me because they prune entire branches, not just individuals, so the people he would have killed become nothing in the grand scheme of who the TVA kills. Finally, it was left unclear why the branches of the multiverse were dying after being freed from the loom. An explanation could surely be conjured, probably in conjecture with the loom (and that might offer hope that Loki could one day leave his post to live his own life once the multiverse was stable).
Loki: Now who's the strongest avenger
man i want more of it.. this finale got me speechless
Loki and What if's The Watcher have the same in common now. They both secure the multiverse.
I enjoyed this show very, very much. Wow, what a finale 👏 🤯👍🏼
Wow, imagaine the God of multiverse.. thats crazy. Love loki.. this series give me a picture everytime i pray to God and he listen through branches timeline…
In the end Loki got the throne he wanted. A loser's throne. A crown that nobody wants yet someone must bear it. Both Asgardian brothers got to wear their crowns. Loki got the Loser's crown that nobody wanted to wear but he had to and Thor got the Allfather's crown that everyone wanted but he had to wear it.
I think best series from marvel so far  Since Avenger endgame  Only few Marvel movies and drama are good  And loki is on the top for now
A comment
Its going all to Plan....He is still Paving the way lol....Sometimes I think they watch each others YouTube videos
I wonder will we see Thor, Odin & Loki reunite before or during secret wars.
I think Thor is gonna find out what his brother is now and is gonna try and free him
Your reading of the episode was excellent. I loved the way you described and narrated it over the images.
Only one word to sum up this entire season! "Pumpkins"
Dude, that final end when Loki destroys the “Time Loom”…I was shocked!!😳😮
10/10
10/10 i loved it
Favourite Series ❤
Loki having a throne is perfect!
Eric Martin and his team really do deserve adulation. The were burdened with glorius purpose and they really came through for us.
Ridiculous, I dont think the transformation suits the character...   That being said, the philosophical dilemma presented waa great and I dont think the story did justice to the dilemma  I pick sylvie side TBH, because when you think hard about it, the option giving everyone free will to choose uow they die is just one side of the coin with a very heavy dose of cognitive bias.  The other side of such choice is basically knowingly guving everyone suffering and injustice...  We can do that, sure, but don't sugar coat it by covering the downside and embellish the good side.  If I was given such a choice, Id let it all end.
Man he always feared to be alone in life and in the end he made this sacrifice and is alone forever.
exited to see what else they have planned for Loki in the coming years!
Finale saved the season. Finally showed Loki true power
So will loki and thor ever reunite?
damn thats quite amazing, but what happened to victor timely
Love the channel! Can’t wait for more awesome videos.
In season 2 ep 5, loki was pruned by another loki....where did the other loki come from??
id love to see thor meet loki during the multiversal war, especially now that loki is a multiversal god
I applaud marvel for giving Loki such glorious purpose
Def a wild finale. Thanks for going in depth on what Loki has now become!
So amazing
Great youtuber. Looking forward to more content!🫡
Great show
No way loki stays there and never leaves he'll be involved in one of the avengers and make appearances. They just made him the god of story's unbelievably powerful no way he just stays there, they'll find a way that he can come and go. just hope we learn how he is able to do that it, does say he is in deadpool so be interesting to see how that works and with mobius being in it too wonder if he took time to see his life then decides to go back to protect that. This the next year of marvels abit shit with all the strikers causing captain America and the thunderbolts to be delayed. Only really looking forward to deadpool, gonna be a sad year.
Great episode🔥
Was not expecting such a finale at first I thought the series was moving too fast, kinda ironic that Loki is holding MCU in reality and fiction
He who ramains created the sacred timeline  Loki: hold my beer  Created the sacred multiverse!
The merging of the timeline into his cape was amazing
I want ps5
If Loki was able to reach the citadel in season 1 to confront HWR then wouldn’t one of his variants easily make it to Loki
So what happened to Renslayer? She woke up in ancient Egypt. What's her path?
Thanks I was trying to understand
Best series in Marvel so far🎉🔥
I like where this show went, I’ll admit that I wish we saw more of his powers but the ending was still great
I rate it 20
🔥🔥🔥

10000000
Definitely the best story from marvel in a long time
I loved this ending. But this series pulls so much shit out of its ass, and there are so many unexplained things. For example: How does Loki have the power to give life to the multiverse? How can he touch threads of the multiverse? How can you timeslip in a place outside of time? How did He who remains not know that Loki has learned to pause time, if he knew everything else that was happening? How was Loki not affected by the timelines disappearing? etc. etc. etc.
I don’t really like the ending, I don’t like that they made Loki not have a very happy ending
will Loki get bored or go crazy for staying in that position for posibly an infinite time? or he's like an entity now and doesn't perceive time as the others?
If let's say Loki let the time loom be destroyed. How can that lead to a multiversal war? I though the loom prevents the destruction of the sacred timeline. So if the loom is destroyed. Doesn't that mean all the timeline will be destroy and nothing will exit? I'm just confuse😅
I have you heard rumors of captain america movie
at least now we have the confirmation that the kang in ant man really died. soft... killed by an ant XD pathetic
Nice job, thank you.
Loki is a new god. Twisted ending. So does he sleep? Not much he can it seems.
finale was amazing!
Damn! This was the quality we were searching in the MCU man❤😮.
Loki is literally carrying the MCU .
So can silvydo the same .. I mean they the same person ..
I think odin knew that
Loki definitely an S tier MCU character
The world tree....that wad awesome....i do wonder if he will ever see thor again...i mean....i feel like it really needs to happen.....like really really
Mind blown by this show. Absolutely loved it.
Good episode!
Best series so far in the mcu
DAMN this is crazy
now Loki is the greatest character in the MCU
I hope I win lol
She is not him…
Aren’t the TVA now going around hunting down Kangs and pruning them, putting them all together in one place? As in creating the council of Kangs?
Very good finale
👍
Loki who remains
Loki's back baby...
I just love the Yggdrasill symbolism in this series. The show itself was awesome and thid amazing character finally found the Glorious Purpose
Loki legit pulled a Cappadonna
I like how Loki always wanted to be king and he ended up being king or even a god of multiverse or time at the end very  touching
I think that Loki is one if not the best character arcs in the MCU. What they did here was beautiful.
Thor would give his remaining eye to get Loki back, he could use the odinforce to create a similar yggdrasil, he could convince a celestial or maybe higher, he could restore the stones, he might even be able to use the symbiotes, who connect all the branches. Thor will try to release Loki, but he will still crave purpose and might go back.
loved this show first time in a marvel show where i rewatch loki series
I think the tea's job is now to prevent incursions, and punish multiversal and time criminals (along with moderating kangs). I think loki will bring together multiversal avengers and interact through illusions. I am so excited and also hope I win a series x!!!
But u dont send to india!
This finale was the bomb!
That ending was very satisfying and unexpected. I guess it should have been predictable, but the Loki show has been so crazy with the twists that it’s almost impossible to guess what will happen next. I love when a character gets a poetic ending. Loki starts off betraying everyone who cares about him to rule Asgard and then earth. Now he has sacrificed his own freedom to save everyone he cares about, but now he is technically the ruler of the multiverse. He went from a villain who always lost to a hero who won the ultimate throne. Loki is now easily one of the most complex characters in the mcu and it was executed quite well
Very well explained with Loki being the ‘life of the multiverse’
Love how they brought in Yggdrasil.
Loki gets a 9/10. This entire series was planned in advance, and the final two episodes brought it all together in such a brilliant way.  I'm so sick of fan boys declaring a show dead before it's finished and put into context.  ...then the fan's scare the studios, the studios interfere with story line, and it all goes to $h!=+  e.g. the "Snyderverse". Of course then the fans B and complain and yell about saving the Snyderverse BUT THEY CAUSED IT TO DIE IN THE FIRST PLACE.
9/10
8:41 Lokis essentially like the new ‘3 eyed raven’ (game of thrones) and the way he was stuck in the tree
I think there will be no Loki in secret wars. Thats the way the MCU ended Loki's character. But in a good way
I'm just wondering if this serves as a prison for Loki OR if he is now basically everywhere all at once.
Did I win?😂
Avenger prime?🌚🔥
Most marvel series i dont even care to watch but loki is a good series in my opinion its also a bit of a sad ending as wel loki sacrificed his own freedom
Loved this episode. Love this series. Awesome.
for some reason I think that in avengers secret war we'll see sylvie and not loki, probably wrong though
loved the ending.  It was not that surprising, but very satisfying. Love Loki!
Centuries later... 😳😳😳 Epic! Best character arc ever! This one goes to 11. I need another season to see how they run the TVA going forward.
Lots of people in other videos who dump on the mcu like yea it’s not going great right now but Loki held its own and I enjoyed it was great seeing his development and I liked how the series went
“You either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain” … they said.  Our boy, Loki Odinson, née Laufeyson, appears to have broken the mould, I’d say.
Hats off to this villain
Is the Time Stone green because of Loki? Did he create it? Did he some how get it to Sanctum Sanctorum?‬  ‪Did Loki make Heimdall send Bruce to the Sanctum in Infinity War since Loki had been there before (in Ragnarok?) Is that why Bruce mentions ‘Loki’ to Tony and Stephen informing and warning them about Thanos?‬
Aah, the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few … or, the one.🤨😅✌️
I was really skeptical when I saw the first episode of the season. I thought it was just to introduce the characters. I watched all the other  episodes the day they came out and really loved each one, but this last one was amazing! I am hoping for a season 3 where Loki can find a way to step away from the tree for an extend period  of time. 9.5/10
He’s actually not the tree
“Im here to save humanity” “From what?” Freedom. Life’s greatest lie!” -Loki
This was by far the best that marvel had put out in a long time.  Bravo. Awesome, heartfelt, epic
My rating: 10/10 most definitely
Hey ps5
So I agree about this show being epic, however I'm a bit confused still about a couple of things.  1. What is He who remains ultimate plan? Why allow the Loki's to reach him in the first place? Unless he needed Loki to take over so the war could start, and then after he wins he comes for Loki?  2. If Loki destroyed the Time Loom, why would the time branches begin to die? Shouldn't they continue to branch out infinitely?
Loki saw the fork in the road and went straight
Fantastic!!!!!!
I really enjoyed this series of Loki definitely a ♾️/10🔥🔥🔥
It seemed like an ass pull at the end.
Forget rulling asgard , bro is rulling the multiverse
I think its not over. I feel Rinslayer found that demon cloud because she use to control it under HWR. I want to see her character spin
Loki is now the God of the Multiverse, and is also (in my opinion) the most POWERFUL character in the MCU (that we’ve seen so far). like if he somehow gets out of that state where he is, he can control time,  is the god of mischief, and is centuries old so has centuries of knowledge.
Is Loki now some sort of Celestial since they are, I quote "Space Gods, ancient race of cosmic beings who experiment on countless species and judge whether a planets/multiverses are worthy of continued existence". I see Loki is now bigger than any living creatue in multiverse.
Loki literally carrying the mcu💀💀💀
Comment 🎉
Loki 2 was boring … it was basically a how to Training video of the TVA for new hires ….. and then a bunch replay rewind
Such a good series
Okay, I come down to comments and I rate this a 1/10.  You got it boss. 😘
The LokiVerse
A masterpiece
Wow, this is one of the best character developments in the MCU. Also one of the most prophetic moments in the MCU. Loki once called Captain America "a man out of time" in Avengers1, which he (Loki) has now become. Loki always had a thing against Captain America. Always mocking him and copying his mannerisms in front of Thor😂.  Yet he now embodies everything that Captain America was and stood for. "A man out of time" protecting everyone he loves, holding everything together alone, and sacrificing himself for the greater good.  The same thing happened to Tony who also hated Cap at first. I think they hated the fact that they could not live up to Steve's virtuous nature. Steve was just a good man. He was a simple man yet he was able to capture the hearts of many people. It just shows you how influential Steve Rogers was, not just to his comrades but even to his adversaries😅.
Comment
WOOOP WOOP
I am groot  I am Ironman  I am Loki
Thanks to Loki Thor can still live forever ❤and the other superheroes also 😢🎉🎉🎉 the best From Marvel STUDIOS
Absolutely stellar return to form for Marvel. This is exactly why character arcs are so important.
Yup
"Die a villian or live long enough to be the hero"... Loki went from a villian to a major hero -- I absolutely LOVE this character arc!!
Loki is officially the best tv series in the MCU. The memes are no longer jokes, LOKI IS CARRYING MARVEL RN. Tom Hiddleston is king.
Kevin Fiege is gonna have a lot of explaining to do at the next Comic-Con.
Great explanation...thank you
10
Loki is the only interesting marvel content in this phase, so well done. There’s rumors of marvel moving away from kang and using doctor doom. I hope it’s not true, this sets up kang so well
Loki is a top tier show for Marvel
Loki is not the god of fn stories he supposed to be Atlez the custodian of the multiverse
What if, his clone could exist each in every multiverse...??? Nahh kinda impossible cause his lending much of his power to hold the timelines, but what if? 😂
In terms of character story and arc, stark and loki are tied for me. by a mile ahead of the others.
aye mane could i get that ps5? Tired of my friends cooking me 😔
Deadpool 3 is now coming out July 26 which was Spider-Man 4’s original release date
It was really hard for me to watch the Loki Series in which Marvel turned yet another beloved character into a husk of himself. Not a God. Had no magic. Beat up by the female version of himself, etc.  But the SE2 Finale was GLORIOUS!  The episode was a Character Arc all on its own. Our beloved, determined Loki got his mojo back & BECAME A GOD AGAIN. Was truly a hero. Very well done. 9/10
Sylvie still has He Who Remains watch. She can move anywhere, anytime.  She can move to Loki.
Also: time stone has Lokis color lmao
Loki season 2 was great.
His adopted mother would be proud…
Imagine this. Thor was desperate and came to the end of time to seek the power to stop Kang.   Loki: Come here, brother. Thor: What the f?? Loki?😂
What if this is why in Across the Spiderverse, Gwen's supposed canon event doesn't happen and the timeline isn't affected? It could be because the events of that movie took place right after Loki Season 2.
Great stuff
I think it’s really poetic that he finally got his throne only after he no longer wanted it
Do y’all think this is better than Netflix’s Daredevil? 😮
I hope Thor knows what Loki is doing and be proud of his brother as his mentality of him is always trouble and killing.
He becomes Yggdrasil which is the tree of life in norse mythology. The caretaker of which is ratotoskr.
Didn’t understand one thing that happened Thank you for explaining it.
Just subscribed
I honestly believe that the team behind Loki, should be in charge of the entirety of the MCU. Movies and Series alike. Everything about both seasons is incredible.
This finale to Loki Season 2 was absolutely awesome‼️ Wow‼️ And we got a chance to see just how powerful Kang truly is. I've been waiting for this...and finally Marvel showed. Of course, I know more is to come💯👍🏾
Amazing writing on this show!
Really loved this series. Tom Hiddleston literally is the perfect cast for Loki, I hope Marvel would let his charavter be part of the MCU for more years.  the series felt like it shouldve been a movie and in a good way, the cinematography and vfx were so damn good
Amazing breakdown as always! You really do such a good job at providing context and just makes me love the show ever more after hearing the breakdown.
Loki really became a hero
Loki can duplicate himself… hmm I’m sensing a hearty season 3
Literally best marvel show and it shows how much care and how thoughtful the team was when planning out these two seasons. It goes to show how having a real intention and not just throwing the story to different writers. Which is what ruined the Star Wars sequel trilogy.
Wait until Thor finds out
Still not so sure how the "timelines" are physical like that. And when it "dies" what does that mean? Is part of the 1800s vanishing when it's dead?
Loki was my favorite villain now he's my favorite hero. What a great series 👏🏾
Probably the best character arc ive ever seen. Burdened with glorious purpose indeed.
This season was great. But I have two issues with this last episode.  1-How does Loki just suddenly become so incredibly powerful and how does he know he can do these things?  2-The growth of emotional connection and empowerment that Loki gets from his friends seems too easily discarded as he finally gets his throne and glorious purpose. Loki starts out just being this loner who betrays people, finds out he has a secret desperate fear of always being alone as Sif said he would in his little torture time, then finally he grows enough to truly connect and make friends, and then at the end he leaves it all behind without any kind of goodbye or even any kind of a longing look back. But hey, I guess he has his throne that he just insisted telling Sylvie he didn't even want anymore.
Awesome!! Hope he'll be back soon
Wow at least marvel is trying to do good thank you because I was confused
Thor will be so proud!  All joking aside, what an incredible finale to top off an amazing series! Kudos to everyone who was involved with this show!
Very good character development. Tom Hiddleston was the perfect choice for the character also.
Loki kept saying he was “burdened” with a glorious purpose, and his glorious purpose did indeed seem like a burden at the end.
Haven’t been on your channel in a while, but after seeing episode 6 of Loki I came and joined the live because it just blew my mind!! Keep up the good work glad you’re enjoying this as much as we are!
The epic scene make me see kid Loki, old Loki, and the present Loki in 30 second. Amazing
This finale was no joke mate
Will there be a season 3
goki🐐🐐🐐
That face in the end.. made me want to hug him. Such a lonely boy.
This was the best Marvel series!!! The end was so amazing and can’t wait to see if Loki ends up getting involved somehow moving forward
💚😢
this was epic
Loki creating Yggdrasil was absolutely genius 👏 🙌
I think that Marvel finally fixed the Kang and Jonathan Majors issue. If needed, the can now replace Kang with Doom as they were considering, because they can make it to were Kang is no longer a problem because the TVA kept all Kang Variants in check. And we can see that at the end when Mobius tells them the 616 variant was already handled, making reference to the Kang from Quantumania.
But would That Drain him Like Kill him at some Point
In all seriousness, why did HWR need to cross paths with Loki?  Couldn't he have had Loki pruned and kept being in charge?
Season 2 10/10 Tom Huddleston acting 20/10 😊
Subscribed , I'll take a PS5 😂
This  episode is awesome! Thanks for the break down
nice
Such an awesome show!
In a way He Who Remains control Luki even at the end, because in a way, he taught Luki on what to do.  Becoming the Tree of Life.
Love Loki
Top notch writing. Top notch performances. Top notch storyline. Man just a really a awesome series to watch. And to watch it as a family took it up several notches.
It hurts that there will be no more of Loki
10
I loved this show !! Great breakdown!
I think he became a battery for the universe. Reminds me of Peter Quill who refused to be a battery for Ego's universe.  But love the growth of Loki who only thought of ruling for his ego is now rulling selfless and for the greater good.
I never thought that Loki would actually become my favorite hero
Awesome video
LEFT THE COMMENT DOWN BELOW
Can’t wait till Thor finds out what his brother did.
Loved this finale. Him turning into the GOD he is supposed to be was friggin awesome!
Season 1 was my favorite series so far and some how season two beat it. Not only did it beat it, it knocked it out of the park with character development, a cliffhanger of for what’s to come, and of course the burden of “Glorious Purpose.”  I think Season two is literally and metaphorically the start to this saga all starting to come together and I can’t wait to see where it goes. Hats of to the entirety of the cast and crew, you’ve outdone yourselves, literally.
And this is why we love the MCU
Tom hiddleston just replaced chris hemsworth as ny fav actor and loki dethroned thor as my fav character.
You people can’t be real, these shows are garbage and the mcu is dead, the only thing that happened in this show was people eating pie and talking about their feelings lol
No one is pointing out that loki has officially become avenger prime
Loki is definitely an amazing series on the MCU right now
Soo soo sooo good
I thought the time loom only destroys the branched time lines, it keeps the sacred timeliness safe
The best show to date
Going back to the finale of the first season, I genuinely could not believe it could get better. This episode shattered that feeling
*But what exactly was He Who Remain's plan that you mentioned at **3:22**?*
This alone revived my hope in MCU
Very spot and complex story. Very intrique. Worth watching
best marvel episode of all!!
I don't think we will see Loki in any movie or series after this finale. Because I think he has to stay there at that location to keep all branches alive.
I was blown away by this series, I waited to watch Loki for a long time but man I have been blown away by the entire series!
Loki season 2 in end dr doom vs loki today now yes 🤩🤩 yes yes yes
So Loki is kinda like the watcher?
Great giveaway!!! Great show hopefully this can make Marvel Great Again
One question..why did kang gave loki the ability to time slip?basically why did kang allowed or planned for any of this to happen and didnt just let things continue the way they were?
But what happens to He Who Remains?
Loki is carrying the MCU!
I genuinely loved the finale a lot, amazing show
This is all because he grabbed the tesseract btw
Would've been sick if Loki after realising what he has to do, went back to Asgard maybe when he was a teenager and just saw all of his family together again.
10/10 !! The only thing that bothers me is that he didn't try to let Sylvie read his mind. He had so much power but that wasn't even an option.
His motive for the ENTIRE ss2 was selfish, he doesnt wanna be alone, but he ended up choosing the most selfless path, and choosing to be alone for eternity. This character development, this profoundness is just... phenomenon. The Loki we loved the least (from Avengers) became the Loki we love the most, what a journey he's had.
Omg!!! The best Loki crown 😍😍😍
I want to win the Xbox series c and ps5 !!!!!!!
Love this series I give it a 10
But... I just don't understand ine thing... This series takes place after the first Avengers movie. Then what happens in Thor: The dark world, Thor: Ragnarok and Avengers: Infinity war? Which Loki is that? How does loki get there?
Can I just say… I love the symbolism of the silhouette of the time branches? He went from this no-account nobody variant, to YGGDRASIL. It’s actually amazing.
Loki is stuck....eh   don't like it
This series is by far the best series I have ever seen. I can't describe the joy I felt watching this episode. The ending is both sad and happy; loki finally got his throne but will be lonely for eternity
Great explanation to the finale. I’m just trying to keep up with it all lol. Love marvel though!!
Absolutely loved it
Loki is and probably will remain the best marvel show/storyline imo
Loki has cemented himself as the best MCU character now. So ironic that he wanted a throne for himself earlier and didnt get one...but now he got the grandest throne, becoming the center of all multiverse... when he doesnt actually want one.
I loved how Loki was able to remain a self contained story throughout its two seasons. Focusing on characters and their arcs is what marvel should focus on above all else rn
Luki finally Becomes a GOD in the center of all.
I wished he put in the original outfit he had in the first avengers.  Looked cooler than this new one
Best marvel shows ever hands down
For giveaway :)
Awesome that Loki holds the multiverse together and it now can branch out infinitely
2 questions - how can Loki hold the multiverse if it grows into more branches and so on, infinitely? How can he hold infinite universes? Or is this multiverse now more limited to Loki's powerful, but limited hold over many of them? 2nd questions - if the multiverse is in such a bad state it requires somebody like Loki to hold it and if not it unravels into spaghetti and void, how did it function before at all? I might be missing something, but I always guessed multiverse in MCU was a sort of a stable mechanism even before HWR became the ruler of the sacred timeline. So, if Loki is giving his life.force to the multiverse, the MCU multiverse is literally on a lifeline, Loki's life support. So, what gave the MCU life force earlier? Maybe I missed it but HWR was not holding everything together (yeah, only one timeline, but he did not hold it with his bare hands and so on). I mean, now MCU is literally on a life support draining Loki's life vitality. So Loki should be pretty immortal now or this multiverse is going to last only several thousand years! Please somebody explain this, I have no idea how this should feel convincing at all!
Im not sure its not clear here but look at that hole again when he looks back for a moment im pretty sure Dromammu pops into view in the tear.
I was hoping for a post credit scene something that could have transitioned into Deadpool 3
In avengers secret war i want LOKI's entrance more grand then thor and captain amercia in infinity war and endgame.
Thanks. Think I understand now. Impossible as a non comic reader to get it from the series. Too many details and meanings. I hate that through the years you need to do homework before and after each movie. Causing me to zone out of it all. But the acting in this series was a joy to watch.
As I understand, Loki 2 was always meant to happen. He made the world tree, that's why the world tree was told in Norse Mythology. Remember that everything in loki 1 and 2 happens outside of time. That's mean he was always there holding the timelines. The multiversal war was cancelled and never happened like HWR says.
Comment
It was heckling poetry.  Tom is such a treasure.
The god of stories.
This channel explained it better 💪🏿
Definitely deserves an Emmy
Honestly never expected for Marvel to deliver this well on the finale I thoroughly enjoyed this season!
This is what Marvel should be. I was speechless. I absolutely loved everything about this series. Loki is the face of Marvel. You what’s sad is that a series is 1000 times better thank the movies they have been giving us, not counting Wakanda Forever and Guardians 3. This is a masterpiece of cinema and filmography. Blown away.
Loki🎉
GOD i love LOKI. I'm usually not a big fan of Marvel, but LOKI is on another level!
I am still in awe of the ending. 10/10. Tom Hiddleston's acting deserves an Award. Epic ending.👏👏👏  ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Revona died?
🔥
This episode was so so beautiful words don’t do it justice the story lines and everything was perfect to the T
I loved the filming style in season 2. They should adapt this filming style to more of the shows

LOKI is the last person who would want the throne and that is exactly what qualifies him for the job, but now he is in a prison and kang its free in the timeline to create his own inventions,  the OB plan its brilliant.. make loki care about other timelines enough that he sacrifice his future in order to save everyones else ...now loki is sitting in a chair tide up..lokis always keeps it moving.. at the end even when he wins he loses , so the first book of the tva it was to create a prime kang that is on OB side when he who remains eventually dies in his prison and the second book its to create a prime loki that is on OB side when eventually sylvie notice that she doesnt have her loki and takes loki ygdrasil back , then OB could give the golden book to any loki he wants and make him KING and the loki who remains will protect OB just like KANG did .. so this will happen  OB its the architech , LOKI (a new choosen loki by OB)its the mother and sylvie is keanu reeves,,
So Loki is stuck to sitting and holding the branches for eternity? No more onion rings and chocolate shakes? One scene (ok there were a few) bothered me. When Timely returned to the control room after successfully fixing the loom, he is still wearing the suit. Wouldn’t every one in the room but Loki die from the radiation?
10
Loki is now the queen of nevers in MCU...
It was definitely my favorite episode of season 2
i have a question. Why do multi branches need to be charged? Didn't everything go back to its natural mechanics after the time loom was destroyed? I don't understand. What was that supporting order before the time loom was created by Kang ?! I thought that multiverse was before, 1 Kang erased almost everything to keep variant away. Or it was like the first Kang from the beginning of time itself, so he has been erasing the multiverse from the start, so the multiverse wasn't existing ever? If so, where the f Avengers got stones from?
Excellent catch spotting the Tree of Life.  I would add that the Tree of Life is also shown in Captain America when Red Skull takes it from its hidden location in a drawer in a wood carving of the Tree of Life!
What a great series! Thanks for the great content, for all time always😅
Did he just become the most import and powerful simp ever?
I loved this episode 10 out of 10💯🙏
was a good episode
So time lines and universe's are the same thing then.
Will we see Loki in Secret Wars or Kang Dynasty or in literally anything?!
Even though that version of loki is yggdrasil now, we can still see him show up in other movies/shows still right? Just other variants of him right?
the only thing i wish is we had one last scene between Loki and Thor, not some cliche goodbye scene but maybe the scene from when they were in that elevator together in Thor 3 would’ve been cool.
Imagine Loki showing up to save Thor, chills
I rate it 1/10 because you told me to
so Alioth ate Renslayer?
Anyone else instinctively tap the skip recap on your screen when it flashed up
༺💚༻🥦༺💚༻
I loved the 2 seasons of Loki
Absolutely incredible!  Also I thought OB throwing out that “no time to argue!” was a nod to Indiana Jones 😭
I just want Loki to learn how to interact with people in the timelines.  Even if it’s just a magical projection of himself with no substance,  I want to see Thor start catching glimpses of Loki as Loki begins to figure out how to make it happen.
Dun  dun dundundun
My son pointed out that the Time Stone is green. He who remains had a purple thing happening.
This episode was insane!! You could feel the sorrow radiating throughout the whole episode
Where did Loki get his power to give life to the dying branch?  Does this mean he is kinda like The Watcher?
Loki is so Cool.
What happened to Rensselaer???? Explain please
I cried 😢 for real and in front of my lady smdh. It was the best thing I've seen since Forest Gump
I just hate the best Marvel has put out in a while is done...but I'm actually hearing good things of the Marvels
Best finale .......Ever ❤❤
That series is perfect ! Perfect cast, story writing, vfx !!! ✨💚💚💚
Burdened with glorious purpose indeed, now everything has become Lokiverse.😢
I just can't quite understand,  why did branches started dying after Loki removed the loom? It's not like loom was giving energy to branches, so what's happened there?
10/10 love the ending knew it was gonna be what it was but was still excited
Lokiiii
Nightmare and the tree, pareidolia from the timeless void
So kang / jonathan majors are gone for good now? Smart marvel
I think renslayer is at the end of time but where the council of kangs are l, hence the pyramid in the background and sylvie ankh earrings and the one Kang from Egypt.
“I am Loki of Asgard and I am burdened with glorious purpose.” - Loki  Glorious purpose indeed.
10
Loki is the only reason why I'm still connected to MCU.
What happens to victor timely at the end after Loki destroys time loom? Did he stay with TVA?
That ending was beyond words. This proves that Marvel still has it!
:)
Perfect, just perfect, amazing character development for loki himself and the marvel Disney plus show, this or more is what is expected of the future of the MCU, lol 😂.
Goku is Loki's B@#$&
I thought that he became the world tree, but I didn’t know he was the source
This series should have been a 3-part movie between End Game and Phase 4, released in one year, 3 months apart. (And Phase 4 should have been totally different, with Kang being the main nemesis out of the gate.)
I want to win this please 🙏 put me in the draw
Love that they still tied it to Norse mythology in the end.
Our Loki was destined to be alone so everyone else could fulfill their lives. He’s tony times infinity
This was awesome! There's just one thing I'm still wondering about... If He Who Remains *made* the TVA at some point, I mean, the universe/multiverse must have existed without it, right? And could potentially do so again, I guess? So why does the destruction of the TVA mean the destruction of the multiverse?
This series is 10/10 for me, it's also the best MCU product, yes, it's better than Shang-Chi.
My question is…. in season 1, HWR said if he dies, multiversal  war happens  and a variant of him will become HWR again by defeating the others. This season HWR is now saying a multiversal war will lead to the destruction of everything and all existence. Can someone explain that?
Is loki replacing kang/hwr now
I’m literally tearing up thinking about lokis arch, this was as powerful as endgame imo
I’m not sure how I feel about the ending 😭😭😭
So my question is... if loki now become the life of the multiverse.. without him there will be no universe & timeline exists then what role is left of marvel Cosmic beings now !💀🙂 they're all out of job ??🤧🤣🤣
Omg plzzzz I need ps5 and also I love you!!

Loki is the best mcu multi verse introduction yet apart from spiderman no way home.
Great break down. Such a brilliant ending. I'll have a PS5 please 😁
No words, it was amazing. Thank you for explaining everything,y'all are the best. I hope i can  win something in the giveaway as well ❤
My Favorite TV Show of all Times ❤️📺... I'm Grateful to be Alive to Witness this...
Watching Loki mature to his role and reclaming his rightful title as a god of Mischief and Time was Epic... ...And the creation of his own version of Yggdrasil that was BIGGER that the original , dont even get me started on that...
thank yoy
Loki created a new multiverse
Imagine him going back in time to kill thanos☠️
Question how do you freeze time if your outside of time … there is no time to freeze … so I’m confused
But what about the other universal cosmic entities like Eternity, the Living Tribunal… would they not get involved or is Loki above them all?
Gimme ps5
im already expecting marvel to ruin this in a couple of years with the kang movie....i can already see it. kang comes and kills loki in the first 5 minutes like thanos and really gives us some blue balls
You explained this so well!!! This is the best explanation/ breakdown I've seen !!! I still was a little confused after watching the episode and still after watching other explanation videos,  but this video really helped
Thanks marcus
I just hope we get to see thor interract with loki and find out the noble sacrifice loki made
Remember he who remain actually comforted him with this idea in S1 finale “ when he said he was old and tored and doesn’t want to do this anymore and said there’s 2 options and 1 of them being he takes over which is essentially one happen
Please I need the giveaway 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏,am from Africa (Ghana)
Keep going!!
I hope the new movies gives Thor the chance to see this version of Loki.
This is just my opinion, season 2 finale is the best episode Marvel has ever put out for a series. Loki is the GOAT.
Nerds!
It was genuinely the most amazing thing in marvel since endgame
Okay he confirmed everything I thought. This episode of Loki was sublime.
Favorite show by far. I’ll take that ps5 if no one else wants it ❤
It means final ending because YOU MADE IT THAT WAY
9/10 for the the entire series!
Best show marvel put out
Wow
The Loki Who Remains... Masterpiece
is there going to be a Season 3?
Well what kind for fragil broken Multiverse needs someone or something to prevent its own destruction....i would leave the moment i knew how to  i mean as i understand it this was idle mode no multiversal time wars (yet) just being there and an incursion every now and then  or is everything happening at the same time which would defy Loki smiling at something being said because it all happen always anyways
Bear in mind, the show was never made for two seasons. It was broken apart due to Covid.
Great explanation, @TheCosmicWonder BUT to add to your final comment about the snake eating its own head...It is ALSO a triple entendre, because He Who Remains was stuck in his own loop and could only free himself if the equation was changed!!!
I’m speechless.
Loki became the character in Marvel Comics called Atlez, who is the anchor of the multiverse.
Since all these happened before End Game....is there a chance he is still alive? He could have used his current powers while he was killed by Thanos?
10 out of 10. The fact he is about to sit and hold it for all of time is crazy!
Good finale
LOL THOR WOULD BE PROUD AND SCARED OF LOKI NOW!
This was 11/10 for sure, so so so good
Felt like og mcu ,havent been this hyped in a while!
I'm still not over the ending of Attack on Titan where Eren sacrificed himself to make sure his friends are safe and living their life. Loki's Season 2 ending is similar to that in many ways. Loki went one step ahead and stayed alive, which means he can still change things he wants to. But What a Series both have been. Sadly it looks like my favourite anime Series and Web Series have ended. But these two are true masterpieces in their own way. Itterasshai Eren and Loki.
Loki is god His power increases with age He spend centuries in time loop and masters time skipping  'He who remain' knows with more age Loki master time hold too. In ending, every temporal radiation going through Loki increases his age and power  Because he is god. Although he give one chance to Sylvie, tva and others to fight and prevent multiversal war But in end Loki will return to "he who remains" and kill Sylvie. That's a bitter truth Because Only he who remains end multiversal war and also why he is know as he who remains indicates he will return and live and only possibility is by killing Sylvie.  Kang dinesty is talking about killing of "He who remains" not "kang the conqueror" and about Sylvie and Loki not Avengers
Loki's self sacrifice for his friends and everyone else was an amazing ending to this season
I would love a ps5
+_+ and god of stories is born :D and i think he would return for sure.
It's not a loop it's a spiral
All I gotta say is wow just wow
Does this make Loki The Watcher of the entire MCU
best marvel project ending in a long time
This series was amazing. Loki's character development is one of the best I've ever seen. Hopefully we get more of him in the future of the MCU.
I believe he throne in Asgard not the void
Great video!
So sad, Loki had to sacrifice what he wanted for his friends. Now he has to be alone to run the multiverse.
what a series
It doesn’t kill everyone in the TVA, it kicks them back to their own timeline
Glorious Purpose
"Your savior is here"
I loved loki season 2
They really convinced me the only two options were: Destroy the Loom and the TVA, and let the free multiverse destroy itself through war. Keep protecting the Sacred Timeline at the cost of every other branch.  But I absolutely love how Loki solved it. Destroying the loom would practically destroy the TVA's power source. And keeping it would prevent any growth of the timelines. So instead he created a living tree out of the timelines. Allowing it to scale to infinity, by constantly growing. As long as it has Loki to guide it's growth. While also supplying energy to the TVA by what I can only assume is some time-flow based variation of photosynthesis.  Now both keeping the free multiverse intact, and allowing the TVA to defend against threats of multiversal war.   Now the question is, where does it go wrong. Knowing that Secret Wars is coming. Is the Kang Dynasty going to reach Loki?
Loki probably the new watcher
Is this the last season or will there be a season 3
I can't be(lie)ve that this is the same loki who came to new york to kill people in 2012
Loki is the only thing good in the m-she-u the only thing thats worth geting in to
Need Loki to find Thor again
This was crazy
I can award Loki my highest compliment.  No notes.
But where is the Watcher?
Is it just me or does möbius resemble Odin? Two sons, the snake ref by the older son, both opposite to eachother, red and green colour! Am I looking too much into it?
When people were saying Loki was carrying the MCU on his back, boy were they right...
Loki WAS/IS The Snake wrapped around the Cosmic Cube that we see in the carving of Ygdrasil in the First Captain America movie...Full Circle Story Arc...
Loki is the saviour of the MCU. The ending was like he was healing the broken Marvel Universe. 💖
what a finale
Lazy ending
I was so worried this season wouldn’t capture the magic of the first one and carry on the bad run in the mcu rn. But I was so pleasantly surprised that Loki has grown so so much. It’s a beautiful transformation from the battle of New York to looking becoming the best person to guard the multiverse.
I want ps5🎉
Yeah it’s a really good ending. It gives them a chance and gives us an understanding of the objective. There is no longer an infinite amount of timelines. So that means if they rid the multiverse of all the Kang variants, they win.
This is the best marvel show so far! Way to pick themselves up after all the previous shows which were not that good
Can I have a ps5 please
The horned "god" on the throne, Loki is an inversion, the idea of Satan taking the throne of God and being the one who through self-sacrificial love gives life to all and free will. I am sure Satan sees himself similarly, as the "god" of freedom and love, though his love of freedom includes the love of all variance, namely that which is against the true God (holiness, righteousness, fairness, law, order, peace). This show is brilliant, well acted, incredibly well made and beautiful, but even Satan appears as an angel of light (2 Corinthinas 11:14), so be careful dear viewers, this show was likely a fantasy of Satan himself to portray himself as the 'hero'. The true God only has one time line, and saved it through the self-sacrifice of His Son, the Lord Jesus, who now sits on the Throne, where Satan shall never sit.
Loki just set the bar! Best MCU things EVER...
So basically Loki has become the MCUs version of the Soul King
When I saw the scene rotating...my immediate thought was "YGGDRASIL?!?!?!?!" and then I damn near passed out.
Crazy series
Yes! But one question, how do you tell your winners they won the giveaway? Do they have to watch your video to see? And if they do, they have to email you? Or do you email them? Just wondering cuz I never once seen or heard someone winning from you. That’s all.
Commenting down below
Loki did not replace he who remains.  Loki is at the start of time where as he who remains is at the end, that is why you see the  purple and the green
Loving the love in these comments
Great finally
Let’s goooo
Ok but can we appreciate Lokis determination for spending centuries to master theoretical physics 😂
When his horns comes on and they have that gold crack like the citadel..that was awesome..I actually thought he was gonna turn into Richard e grants Loki! But the glorious purpose from e grants scene to the end of this episode was awesome!
Loki is the Best Series Disney+ has to offer
Best series loved it
Honestly one of the best shows I’ve ever seen. Up there with True Detective and The Wire
8/10
Loki and End Game are the best that Marvel has given us by far. I hate that the this new phase is killing the brand but Loki has given me hope.
When Loki was first introduced all he wanted was a throne and he lost every attempt to get one. Now after the best most developed character arc in the mcu all he wants is to be with his friends to the point he even says "The last thing I want is a throne" but in the end he has to let them go and take the throne to save everything. So in a way even after saving the entire multiverse like they said in season 1 episode 1 loki is still destined to lose what he really wants. This show is by far the best thing to come out of the multiverse saga! 10/10
What an amazing show! I can’t believe it. Finallyyyyy taking back the MCU
All because Sylvie couldn't stop being a murderer lol.
I think Loki had only one option, that is to replace He Who Remain. HWR planned it all along. Loki will understand why brunches needs to be pruned and accept the job offer. This was the path paved by HWR for Loki. Loki accept the job offer eventually but does differently than HWR. Rather than selecting a branch as secret timeline, he gave people free will.
I have a doubt, if Loki is igrasil and he cannot leave the throne how can he be in secret wars
Let's not forget Miss minutes I think she truly became a villain towards the end, she was very much in love with Kang I think if his variant were to try to take over the TVA she would help him she still knows things Loki doesn't ❓❓
Can I please get the ps5?
I'd give it a 10/0 (hat tip to O.B. there). Amazing ending - way better than I was expecting.
Excellent writing for this show, what an ending!
So has anyone wondered if the universe is supposed to naturally die off after trillions and trillions of years? Like what if HWR and now Loki are just preventing the natural cycle of the universe ending and restarting over and over again. It would make sense that at the end of time someone would harness the power of time to keep it intact instead of naturally dying out and consumed by a black hole.
Great video !!
AMAZING finale! Loki finally found his purpose as a God! 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 Marvel saved the phase with this one!
Abey sala edge of tomorrow bana diya is episode ko
This series has been a complete slam dunk.  I knew it was going to be good, but I had no idea they'd have pulled it off this well!
So he becomes yggdrasil 😂
God of Stories Loki = Big W
Excellent content!
Man those timelines symbolize the mcu and loki holding them means he’s carrying the whole damn mcu 😂
Yoooo my son would love an xbox for Christmas
The biggest burden.
Loki is prolly the only reason I haven’t given up on marvel yet that and the upcoming projects they have
"the one who needs everyone end's up alone"
Loki my man!
By the far, the best episode of this season, probably the last season for Loki. Best MCU Series I give this episode a 9.5/10
goated show
In wandavision there was a scene where Agatha was fighting Wanda  in a billboard poster there was a green tree that resembled Loki's time loom
I was so pissed when thanos ultron and all those avenger 💩  used to toss around loki like he was nothimg and now all of them fools are under his mercy, infinity stones has no power over him he is Too overpowered right now ❤
I get that Loki has to hold other universes and all that but can he project him self into other timelines with a clone of his?
Just realized I missed an episode. Damn
Loki is basically the most powerful being in the universe.
What a series
I say a 9.5
That’s crazy he’s just gonna sit in a chair and hold onto every timeline to give his friends and the multiverse a chance to fix it!
It seems Loki finally got his throne. The throne of time, space multiverse everything it is all his!
Odin would be proud
Loki was done right. From start to finish. Kudos marvel… another one in the bag finally after the last half dozen or so completely crapping the bed.
Now I'm sad again Loki can't get out. Always been my hero.
Hello luv your vid was confused def deserved the sub :D
Bro The finale is crazy. Honestly, 8/10 could have explained it better (in the series)
Lokiiiiiiiiiiiii
So his purpose was no never sit on the throne in Asgard his purpose was to give life? If so that’s amazing
Does this mean Loki can be the cameo in movies now?
Just subscribed.  Love your content.  The Loki Season 2 finale and the series as a whole has been nothing short of amazing.
Loki is the best thing theyve made since endgame.
Hey, give me ps5
Ps5 Please 😢
Ps5
Loki is about to be the bridge of all mcu love it
Except he didn’t go back to the time where Victor dies because there his friends were just taken  out of their real lives. The Mobius that decided to go to his old life doesn’t remember it. So Loki should’ve gone back in time to a earlier moment
I love loki
Loki🔥🔥
he is a prisoner
LOKI GOD OF STORIES🪄
Awesome series finale!
This was the best series in the mcu hands down
Thanks for this video!
Hi
This ending was so interesting and now I kinda get it more lol
Awesome analysis & breakdown!! Thank you
It was a brilliant finale... i love that not only did he win, but he because the ultimate hero
I want to see Valkyrie face when she know this
We’re definitely back…the branches taking the form of Yggdrasil a NORSE MYTHOLOGY element and showing how the branches are ever growing because of the vastness of the multiverse….goddd the snake eating it’s own tail….the kang stuff to come…..this has to be top 5 marvel content of all time.
It seems like it’s a finale not a season finale. I think Loki will be helped by strange in doctor strange 3
but if loki controls the timelines now what is kang doing then ? what is kang controlling
The Loki show is like Doctor Who 3.0
Didn't expected loki to become the most important person of all multiverse... And there we saw he has much more potential then just doing illution and teleport or mind control.
This was amazing. The story moves from comic book to powerful myth.  Loki made a choice of genuine selfless love.  Wow.  He saved them at the loss of what he’s wanted… or rather he ended up wanting good for them over anything for himself.  It was amazing.  A god who was willing to sacrifice himself for those he loved.  The best story.  While I’d love to see Loki again this is a fantastic end for Loki.
Do you think Loki can rewrite the script for the original Captain Marvel movie? 😂
Absolutely incredible. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
That's kind of interesting, since Thor caused Ragnorok, and Loki is embodying its opposite in becoming Ygdrasil.
I cried when I saw the tree of life. I literally have it all over my house and wear it on a pendant. This show was beautiful.
Loki has to be the best Marvel Tv series to date. I hope we get a season 3!
this is the best series in the mcu currently.
Xbox > PS5. Such an amazing story and sad part of having to live alone. While giving everyone free will and giving everyone a chance
This means Loki is holding the Marvel Multiverse holy sht
Man oh man. Loki is a universe on its own. Marvel got nothing on him  lol
Loki is without a doubt the best thing after Endgame...the chemistry between Owen Wilson and Tom Hiddleston is amazing
Look Loki’s emotional because he have to sacrificed to save people from the timelines and multiverse. We have to waiting for next what happen Loki in Deadpool 3.
But what does Loki do now? Just sit down for the rest of eternity?
amazing series  but what does this mean for Kang when Loki is He Who Remains
I don't understand why hwr put loki on this path when he has nothing to gain
Loki character development is just outstanding 👏 it has been a long journey from 2012 villan   to saving multiverse 😍
So he'll be sit there forever? I mean. Will we see any action from loki?
I want to enter
PLEASE SOMEONE tell me the which EXACT SONG from the score, this final song is called!!! i NEED IT IN MY LIFE 😍 please tell me
This brings it all full circle. Loki gets a throne - but instead of a selfish ascent to power, it's an act of selflessness and sacrifice.  I really hope the MCU allows Thor to meet this version of Loki.
I know Loki is the God of stories but that’s only gonna last for now. When Doom destroys the multiverse and creates war world Loki might be freed and return as Avenger Prime. To replace Kang they should make Renslayer a variant and become Terminatrix. It’ll make perfect sense as a plan put together by he who remains.
Loved the video. Good work team.
Bro I’ve never watched a show so good I’ve never had a show have me saying OMG 100 times
The mcu multiverse saga is actually taking place during loki run as he who remains.
Loki has always been my favorite and I’m glad he’s finally getting the respect he deserves. And he’s being shown as strong instead of getting bodied by everyone
Man this show made me really hate silvy, she was the real villain of the show, not he who remains. Silvy think with her emotions and she was ready to let everything in existence get destroyed
So technically, Kang is useless now,  I was hoping for a stronger and a Kang to win at the end
S02 E06 - 20/10 🎉👏🏻 this is the best episode ever from loki. Loki is one the best series out at the moment.  Can't wait to see what happens next and where he will make the next appearance. 👌🏻
that "see you soon" from Kang now has a sense
what i don't get is how do Incusion come into all of this (?)
This Loki team should direct the next avengers movies
9:48 madame web may meet him
Love this series it was great
Loki just became one of the strongest character ever ,can travel through time and space can also control time and now is holding the f multi timeline together .One of the best character development ever and one of the best series ever
8:38 cerebro from xmen 😅
Loki is the tree of life. holding the infinite growing leaves, Kangs and they universes. They all fighting each other and they don't know of Loki existing, the one holding them together in one multiverse.
Amazing finale!!!
I thought he was gonna have to kill sylvie... 😢 im glad he didnt. But now ima gonna miss loki!
What did post credit mean?
So how does this make Loki different then Eternity now?
It was such a great series 10 out of 10. At no time was I disappointed. This series should be the template for all the next Marvel series coming.
the GOD OF STORIES is here..!!!!
best show ever
The only question I have is did loki literally live 400 YEARS just to learn everything OB knows?....just to fail. That's insane
Most powerful character in the mcu now
This eps means that every movie/series containing any multiverse connection happened due to loki second season finale!!
Such a good episode! He really did become the god he needed to be
Best ending 😵
This should have been a movie series... every super hero has got a trilogy series..could have been better than marvels and Thor L&T.. Definitely Wrong planning by MCU team..  This intense evolution and a perfect tale of Loki the real God of MCU, was amazing...
That's the reason time stone is green👀...  You've got it?
This was one of marvels best projects from recent times. Right behind Guardians of thr galaxy vol 3. Definitely a W. Rushed to this channel immediately after thr finale...needed some explanation on the purple atmosphere renslayer was looking at in the end scenes
I have a doubt. What happened to Victor at the end? He was present at the TVA with them, then where he went?
Comment !
Loki definitely has the best character development of the MCU so far
This was one of marvels best projects from recent times. Right behind Guardians of thr galaxy vol 3. Definitely a W. Rushed to this channel immediately after thr finale...needed some explanation on the purple atmosphere renslayer was looking at in the end scenes
So what is next after all of this?
Ty for explaining
11 out of 10
Marvel will not top this
Its sad that this is one of the best shows ever made and we are extremely likely only getting 2 seasons of it...
10 out of 10 😊 👏 👏 👏
One thing i couldn't understand..How Loki has the power to hold all the branches together for eternity?
Every Sacrifice Comes with a Reward 🙏❤ What an Episode!!!
I'm actually hyped again for the first time since End Game.
Amazing season finale ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Such a good series. Series 2 was especially brilliant!  I question things further now because did HWR actually plan Loki to break the loom and ultimately take his place overseeing all the different timelines and branches? Otherwise if it was purely to stop Sylvie from killing him (HWR), surely he could of done that himself when you see him pausing time on her and making her dissappear, why would he need Loki to do it?
What do think the next step for loki in the MCU is this eps feels like not the finale of the series but for this character! Ps5/Xbox giveaway 😅
What if he has to poop...
Thanx for the explanation! Still don’t like Majors I hope they replace him
P E A K
This means Jonathan majors is getting deleted from marvel since loki is now he who remains
Great breakdown 🤟
The slow rotating shot to reveal Yggdrasil World tree is probably the most beautiful thing the MCU has produced.
So technically HWR is dead now? Like obviously he’s gonna come back some way but rn he’s dead??
Thanks for the detailed video, there was some things that I learned that I didn't catch like the first S1 episode and last S2 Episode being named the same and yggdrasil meaning. You're the best Marvel YouTuber out there!
Best series in mcu history by far!! Love this show!!
I loved it, but I must confess I didn't understand so much 😂
Can someone explain what mobius said about 616 tool care of the variant? Is it ant man quantumralm and kang??
He got his throne , god of everything. Just as mobius said .
Does this mean Loki is the one true god of the MCU since he is holding everything together and breathing life into it?
A good Thor arc could have been epic after endgame. Instead we got a goofy Love&Thunder movie
Love everything about this my only question is wouldn’t this be crippling his character as he can’t really be featured in future films because he has to sit there and hold those timelines together?
This was awesome.Cant Loki put a copy of himself in his place to control all branches .
I cant help but think that it is so torturing for loki to just become the tree and sit for eternity.....that is no more life to live for him and being with his friend or seeing his brother
LOKI: INCEST WARS
Loki and möbius will be in dead pool 3. So we’ll see him next then.
Show was unbelievable
He finally got his throne.
Soooo right now is loki the most powerful one in the marvel-verse from what we seen now. Including kang
the tree will die when ragnarok starts, and ragnarok already happened - loki started it in 2017 thor movie
I had goosebumps, tears in my eyes. This finale was AMAZING.
I loved episode 6! It was awesome!
My respect for loki skyrocketed this episode. Spending centuries in a time loop to help his friends, to eventually isolating himself so that everyone could live. Hes come a long way
No joke.. i ddnt understand 100 % what happend at the end.. but i felt sad in the good way
Damn, this episode HURT, With no confirmation of Lokis Return. Probably the end of the best character in the series: Mobius. This Episode was BIG, Not perfect, maybe too long but BIG and it hurt, I can see Loki Season 3 even though it’s unlikely
What if Loki goes back and prevents himself from invading NYC and instead aligns himself with the Avengers and brings them back to fight Kang. That’s how I hope they bring the OG Avengers back without disregarding their sacrifices in Endgame.
Remember when he and Möbius went to a point in time and saw Norse Gods and they had Balder but not him. I think that was foreshadowing this.
what a show!!! loved it
Amazing development. The writers crushed it!
That final episode was great, the entire series was fantastic. 10/10
Definitely the best series on Disney!
Nobody's gonna talk about Renslayer waking up next to a pyramid and the blue light of space craft? I think it's Rama Tut
This was the best piece of television I have ever watched.
Loki fully carrying mcu rn
🎉
Odin, Thor & especially his mom Frigga would be proud.
I believe that Kang said if the TVA was destroyed Kang would just build another one.
Explained a lot for me thanks!
10!Loki tv series, Like going to a movie and the restroom is full. The waiting was great. Loki is number #1
He can take a break and slip again.. And power them up all over again so he's op
I’ve never been a consistent subscriber but I’ve watched tons of your videos every week. Life is life-ing and can’t afford the PlayStation but I hope you’d really consider me. Thank you❤
This is not the end of loki, the sun has to shine once again for him and thor
Simply one of the best endings of a show ever. Glad they finally got one right over there at Disney marvel 😂
What symbolizes the tree at the end of time?
So at the end with Loki on the throne holding all the branches, is this like the tree of Yggdrasil?
Best show of 2023 hands down,🎉🎉🎉
Was scared the ending wasn’t going to be good, this blew me away.
10, most definitely 10! ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
So I think what Loki did at the end is what the kangs at the end of antman were referencing too and what the tva was talking about 616 taking care of it. They can’t account for infinite but went right back to trying
My God this was one the best things I've seen in the Superhero Genre I never imagined a character would have such a fantastic turn to their story this finale had everything I wanted it to be from A Betraying God he becomes the life of Multiverse i am flabbergasted by this finale this is why Loki is my favourite series and now becomes my favourite character  might watch the episode again.
10/10 unbelievable. Best show, best writers, and it’s not even close. Truly remarkable how this show has captivated people to try and stick with Marvel… quite literally ironic that Loki ties everything together at the end cause he sure is trying to hold the fan base together lol
But how does have loki have this much power within him. we have seen loki can be killed by powerful beings but this seems like scarlet witch level of power or more. what is the reason behind this much powrr ?
Reincarnation baby
It was so amazing. My jaw dropped until I finished the episode. It is an absolute perfection in my opinion
10/10
Amazing arc for Loki  Didn’t expect to love the character this much   Like Thor in Ragnarok,  Loki has reached his full potential as a God   Ironic that he has finally discovered his “glorious purpose”  But nobody knew his glorious purpose was to save the multiverse by putting others before himself   Phenomenal series  Will definitely miss the Loki team
This is what HWR remains wanted all along, he was tired of it all, he wanted Loki(and sylvie) to replace him. Its stated right there in S1. Once again HWR paved the road. He passed the burden on to Loki.
Just when i thought the MCU is just wack, Loki comes along and just pulls me back in! WOW I WANT A SEASON 3
This is a phenomenal explanation video. Thank you for your great work, sir.
LOKI WHAT CHARACTER ARC for the MCU 👏👏👏👏👏
I gotta say, the ending is really profound when you think about it. Loki's desire for a throne, now fulfilled by his sacrifice. When it was mentioned that what makes "Loki a Loki is that they are destined to lose", the episode pointed Loki back each and every time to his inescapable destiny where he had to lose himself–burdened with glorius purpose in order to save everything.
Wow
I couldn’t get over the disappointment of no Kang for the whole season
Can cosmic wonder ship the ps5 to Philippines? Would mean the world to me 😢😢😢😢😢   great content! ❤ thank u, sir! 12:00
So this was the end of Loki? He can't leave or the branches will die. I did enjoy the whole Loki series and give it a 10. Also like that they explained outside of space and time which they get from the bible.
glorious pourpose . cant explain what i feel with tears in eyes both good and bad and say nothing else than . glorious purpose
Best Disney series
TRULY THE GLORIOUS PURPOSESSSSSSS
I think we can all agree if the production team for this shows was given responsibility for all the MCU shows, even if it took longer for stuff to come out would be a vast improvement
Amazing finally!!!!
Loki series was phenomenal. Mind blowing story arc. Only question I have is can loki now timeslip, from Yggdrasil.
Where the hell is The Watcher
I just love how the Secret Invasion and Loki finales created the most powerful brings in the MCU but one was more acclaimed than the other because one came about through ACTUALLY good writing.
Need that ps5
The show was always about free will
He finally sit on a worthy THRONE !!!
This was an awesome explanation of the finale for us new Marvel viewers. I had no clue what Loki was doing but now it all makes sense. Now I need to know how two Mobius' will exist on the same timeline?
The timelines are now green with Loki…and the time stone is…coincidence? I THINK NOT. Beautiful way to wrap up the series tho with that ouroboros symbolism in the ep titles
I need IQ 1000 to understand 🤕
I am happy that the multiverse is safe by one of my favorites character in mcu Loki!
this honestly reminds me of the Arrow becoming Spectre in the arrow series. He also went through a very tough time just like Loki and realized that his only option was to become the Spectre in order to keep balance throughout the multiverse.
I love that Sylvie gets it.. "He's giving us a chance.."
man loki is carrying MCU bro the show its 1000000000000000000000/10 its so good the finale really hit me hard
Nice content, best one yet .  just subscribed ✅
Hi
@TheCosmicWonder What an awesome finale, how great is Loki’s costume as he is walking out toward the loom…. GLORIOUS!!!
My interpretation of the ending was that Loki and Kang are just rotating who controls the universe. When Kang gets bored he hands it over to Loki. When the TVA messes up or something happens to Loki, it goes back to Kang. If Kang wanted Loki to manage the sacred timeline, he would've just made sure that Slyvie and Loki never met. Is this a wrong interpretation?
I love this series, pique MCU! And the evolution of Loki as a character is truly awesome.
10 out of 10. A masterpiece finale but I wish we see more of Loki and I believe we do because if Loki can sense and monitor every multi verse this means he can also feel the danger coming into his brother ( thor’s ) universe in secret war
I LOVE how they ended his arc can’t ask for a better ending
Beyond 10/10
Loki never really had any friends, he gets some, and then becomes a friend to us all.
Loki now controls the Timestone
That didn't sound right, he said that everything but the loom is destroyed, including the TVA since it was easily replaceable. The loom safety mechanic destroys everything but the sacred time line, it sacrifices the tva and everything else. I'm sure that was the situation. He and the sacred timeline were the only thing that survived. So loki destroyed the loom and replaced it with himself to sit and direct time like a cop at a crosswalk but not truly control it. And you explained this later in the video....good job.
Loki is everything everywhere all at once
Give Hiddleston an Emmy!
What was missing in this series was the appearance of a real badass Kang variant: imagine a being who could time slip like Loki, but was focused on conquering? Having problems fighting the Avengers? Brb--spend a couple of years creating better weapons--then, he's back: armed with better weapons and knowledge of the opponents' strategies.
Best damn character developed in the MCU.   From the first ever villain for Avengers, to now benevolent saviour of the multiverse.   Tom Hiddleston deserves an Emmy for this.
Loki=tree of life
Hi, I think Loki is only holding this universe and its timelines. It may be no TVA in others universes, maybe Loki is still a villan in others universes.
Loki did both what Doctor Strange and Tony Stark.
It’s like kang said in quantumainia, I saw the multiverse and it was dying
Well this definitely saved marvels ass! Nuff said
Maybe this is there way to get rid of Jonathan Majors (Kang) and bring Doctor Doom in lmao. I loved Loki and Kang in this episode, but what fell short for me was not getting to see more in depth the consequences even just a sneak peek of the ramifications for what he did. Seems like they spent too much time on the supporting cast and should have made the finale all about loki and the choice he made. They could have used the previous episode to give the supporting cast closure and give the entire finale to the after effects of Loki’s decision. Just what would have made it better for me. Like I said. The ascension of Loki was masterful and breathtaking.
This series showed the true threat of Kang. A lot of people were concerned that we’ve already seen multiple variants of Kang die but just like I’ve been saying from the beginning. One variant of Kang on his own isn’t that powerful. Like He Who Remains said “just flesh and blood”. The true threat of Kang is the fact that there are pretty much an infinite amount of them. Like the Hydra in Greek mythology, You can kill one variant but there’s always going to be more variants of equal or greater power. Not to mention the fact that a lot of variants are from the future so they’re way more technologically advanced than the main MCU heros are.   I also love how the “see you soon” line makes so much more sense now
Not only surpass thor and odin, now his level is WAAAYYY above any gods in MCU 😂
1/10 for killing a villain i like
Did you just tell me to mark this episode “one out of ten?”
The writers of Loki definitely smoke weed.
It was all apart of Aizens plan, aizen paved the road!
Was the best series..n can compete with alot of mcu movies
Journey of a mischievous adolescent chasing quick wins to a man holding the burden willingly for everyone else
Need more Johnathan Majors come on Kang Dynasty! So if Loki is now the multiverse and He Who Remains knows everything doesn’t that mean he planned this too?! So now Loki and Sylvi can’t enchant Aliyath doesn’t that seem like it was all going according to He Who Remains plan 🤔🤦🏽‍♂️ he seems to be a much bigger trickster and far more devious than Loki. I dnt think this was the only way., I think it was all by design because really all your doing is keeping Loki stranded giving life to the multiverse.,so now he can’t leave and the infinte Kang variants are all now from the future which are the evil variants 🤦🏽‍♂️ I highly doubt Kang didn’t see all of this happening or didn’t plan any of this 😂 I mean he tricked Loki this far right and told him it was all a rode paved by him twice so far when they thought they where winning but it was all going according to plan
This is how good all the other mcu shows were supposed to be. From start to finish this show was phenomenal
Loki is easily the best thing since endgame! After this season Loki has become a lot of people's favorite Hero! I love his growth ❤
my boi loki had me tearing up most definitely best mcu series
loki is the face of the MCU. Odin might regret picking his fav child now haha
So it's a all happy ending, not just for loki but lierally everyone in the multiverse, I'm glad the TVA is now dedicated to hunt problematic kang problems, And loki being the life essence of the multiverse, but my god what a series this was I enjoyed it from beginning to end, hopefully we see a potential appearance of loki in secret wars or idk but ey best Series marvel,s  ever done.
In a way the tree is an allegory that all the branches (other Disney Marvel movies) are dying but this show is the only thing holding it together lol
This was by far the best ever season finale that could have been possible.
The series so good but so sad at the same time
Man…this was kind of trash. What actually happened? Seriously. What happened at the end? No more incursions? Is Loki hold the multiverse together? And how? His time slipping gave him super multiverse powers? How does this impact MoM, The Marvels, No Way Home? As a fan of the comic Secret Wars, and the incursion event that led up to SW, this MCU version is horribly confusing, disjointed and just bad. Where is Kang? Loki is just literally holding together “infinite” timelines? This could have ended with Loki becoming the Beyonder or something outside of time, but this was bad.
Loved the "Tree of Life" imagery Loki  - as he became God of the Multi-verse  - created.  It is so sad that in the prior episode he admitted to Sylvie that what he really wanted was to be with his friends.  And he was a God outside time - he was never supposed to be there but he stepped out of the sacred timeline to begin this series (in season 1).  And so he had no "true"  place in the world - he was "supposed to" die by Thanos's hand.  He was a man without a home.  And he found a home in these people and he loved them.  Yet he had to sacrifice it all to save them for that love.❤😢  And he is alone.
9:55  Literally have an OC character that can manipulate the Fabrics of the World Tree itself
I got madame web vibes
Loki, God of Free Will.
GOD OF TIME 💀
i dont think he who remains is really dead i think he will show himself in khang dynasty
Big MCU fan. I understand everything that happened in the finale and why it’s important, but the finale was not that dope y’all chill 😅
Still kinda sad dude gotta stay there to hold it all togheter
So glad to have found your channel! There are a ton of similar, but you got a great way with words and editing and it’s really enriched the show...looking forward to a binge! Great stuff!
when i saw the shape he took for the ending a tree specifically i thought about yggdrasil and how naturally it fits here seeing its from norse mythology.   Edit: I made this comment at the beginning of the video
Very clear explications, thank you! My only question remaining is: what happens to He-Who-Remains? Like Loki nor Sylvie killed him. The fact that Loki destroyed the timeloop shouldn’t kill H-W-R. …?
The end was a 10/10! Loki is truly a God. 💚💚💚
Why were the branches dying though??????
Wish Thor had the chance to see what his brother has become.
So is it like the MATRIX, Neo meeting the Architect and having to go back into the Matrix??
Honestly this was a huge character development for Loki, and even though he might not return to the movies, at least he sort of helped the Avengers somehow.
One of the best marvel shows if not the best. Really like the content you post, keep it up!
you see the flick?  he flicks her like iron man does the pavilions .   the kang tech pad is derivative of stark tech...
Just a theroy maybe Council of  Kangs referred to He Who Remains dying rather than the variant we saw in Ant Man because it was He who remains who was controlling them rather than what we thought that they referred to the variant in Quantam Realm because that doesn't make sense that why would they be scared of someone who is already exiled him so maybe that's why they waited till He who remains dies and now the multiverse is open to them setting the secret wars
Only thing i don't get is what happens to the Victor timely in the tva after loki makes his move to become yggdrasil, if we also see the tva manual not getting delivered to young Victor in the 1800s? But we also see Renslayer in what looks to be Egypt,  and the purple hue of kangs ship landing to probably find her. And maybe also Victor.  I dunno that was left very open ended but I guess that's the point
Awesome explanation
That was a good breakdown. Thanks
Do you think that the council of Kangs will notice what Loki did?!
so loki can't reunite with thor anymore?
I'm still kinda left wondering, will the TVA still go after Deadpool and arrest him for creating new branched timelines at the end of Deadpool 2? And if so, will Deadpool 3 serve as a Prequel to Loki Seasons 1 and 2?
Absolutely brilliant.
loki is now loki god of stories
nice
Loki not only saved the multiverse,  he saved Marvel and Disney's arse.
100/10!!!! hands down the greatest thing Marvel has ever done.
Thanks for the ps5 🎉
It left me wanting way more and finally feel like marvel had a good thing going. 9/10
Did he really smile?
Lots of cheerleaders
No greater love than a friend lay down his life for his friends - John 15:13😢
I loved it! It was mind-blowing to see! I was on the edge of my seat! This was truly spectacular! Great job Marvel job well done!
i couldnt see the timelines dying after he let go so I was confused about that until now. thanks for explaining
He Got His Throne, but He is all alone, for all time, always.... (For Now[?])
Loki is the finest series the MCU has ever created. Hiddleston is an amazing actor that has brought Loki through the most epic hero arc imaginable. I’m simply blown away by the profoundness of the ending and the entire series.
THIS IS WHAT MCU IS SUPPOSED TO BE. This finale MADE SO MUCH SENSE not only for the stories to come but thinking back, It ALL makes sense now. This FINALE was not like every finale. I really liked the 1st season and THIS is the series whose 2nd season made the 1st season better than before. I don't know about you'll but I saw this finale then went to THE MARVELS whose Post-credut scene REALLY made my day whole. One of the best days for an old MCU FAN like me.
Loki was far better than the Agent of Shield
I’M STILL SHOCKED
You got to live the imagery in how the time loom turned into a tree …. He literally flipped the kangs equation on its side to become the tree👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾
Marvel made me speechless from God of mischief to God of the multiverse and time...... but I do hope that they find a way after the Kane war to make the branch remain cause I still want to see more of Loki . The character is getting more interesting.
This was one the best scenes and endings in MCU history. I always loved Loki and knew he deserved a Chair.
Great explanation !
Incredible. Who is the threat on the TVA document? I can't see it...
Jaw dropped. Heart racing. Simply incredible. WTF. Can we finally say the MCU IS BACK!!!?!? The Marvels was absolutely incredible from visuals to finally getting some connectivity. I still have no words for Loki. NO WORDS.
Question did he who remains paved this road also did he know this was going to happen because if the council of Kangs still already exist is it possible he remains is one of those Kangs because he paved a lot of freaking roads.
Absolutely phenomenal series and the ending is jaw dropping. Love it love it love itttttt!
I wannnna win
So...if there is an infinite number of variants, and an infinite number of possibilities and alternate timelines, is Loki observing timelines where he and Sylvie can be together?
The final scene where Loki looked at the camera with the green timelines behind him, gave me this Neo / Matrix vibe!
It restores my marvel love
I loved the episode.❤ 💯 💯 💯
Loki's line in Thor Ragnarok "You're savior is here!" really makes so much sense now
Avenger prime is born
Loki is carrying MCU
Loki was extracted from his timeline just before Thanos came to the MCU, what happens now to his timeline? does this mean all other movies that came after Loki got to The TVA are all different timelines? We know Kang was out side the timeline in the quantum realm in Antman latest movie, was that Kang running away from TVA? or was he thrown there by another Kang? Gees this is getting complex by the day
everyone likes to shit on marvel recently but i genuinely enjoyed all of loki hoping for more
Well explained 10/10
Thor should've been so proud of Loki. Thor has no idea that Loki is a king of the whole mcu
Wonder what Thor would think if he came to know about all this 😁
Loki is the best series that I have ever seen! Kudos to the writing team, directors and actors. Fantastic job!!!!!!
Loki becomes the king finally
Loved Loki season one, it was an absolute 9/10 (not as good as films like infinity war, iron man, etc. Loki season 2 was also great, marvel gets too much hate nowadays, yeah they've recently released bad ones like she hulk and eternals, but they're still making stuff like this. 8/10 not as good as season 1 but had amazing lore with the time slipping and that ending was great.
Most of season 2 is pretty bad, it's just a set up for the finale which is goated. Idk how to grade it. Sylvie was so, obnoxious, annoying and arrogant all throughout the show, she was truly insufferable along with the AI generated dialog. But this season is still the best thing that Marvel has done recently.
At the end of this episode, I said that if Loki decided to go back and fight the Avengers, there is no way for him to lose this time. Because he controls time, he could pause the Avengers in their spot and continue to take over the world, and he would essentially win this time.
This might sound crazy, but this loki series. Especially that last episode. Is the greatest thing marvel has ever done. The writing, the special effects, everything.... Blows end game out of the water. They need to use the same team of writers and special effect artist for all their shows & movies.
Can MCU bounce back?
The tree linking the 9 Realms stood out to me also.  What if he is behind the creation of the infinity stones so that he ends up in the same place? He has powers relating to 4 of the stones.  Can't link the soul stone to him.
It was a 10.
The I’ll see you soon was for Loki
Nice
Loki szn 2 is the best material sinde endgame. I love how Loki is really his own character and he’s not always thought of after Thor now. His character development is great. He should be the face of the mcu now. (Was iron man)
It’s like the ultimate loki he has moral he has his throne he is important but just Also he controls time, its like the best super power
Epic ending. Tom hiddleston deserves Awards 🎉❤❤❤
Beast from xmen appears in marvels credits. Monica rambeu ended up being in X men universe
So Loki died ?
His final smile with little painful tears😞 never expected I would love this Loki character so much
Seeing Loki become this new god was beautiful
Loki is a great standalone series but it would have made much more sense if someone how the Loki taken prisoner after the attack of NYC was time slipped with the Loki the moment Thanos killed him. There is no way that Loki goes from attack of NYC to I must take on the responsibility of protecting the infinite multiverse because of self-sacrifice and friendship of a Mobius and Sophie of which he’s only known for relatively 2 weeks. Naw, NYC Loki would have been pissed and vengeful from taking the “L” from the Avengers. This is the same Loki that was cool getting his brother banished forever. Who has been a twisted plotting so and so for a few thousand years and we’re supposed to accept that he’s changed in the course of 2 weeks? The Loki that was killed by Thanos had a few yrs of self-reflection before he took his 1st steps towards redemption. It doesn’t make sense.
Greatest character development in live action comic book content  history . Villain to saviour  of multiverse .💚
What approached Renslayer????
Hi can I have a PS5 please
Thought the finale was fantastic. The best Marvel TV content for sure.
10/10
From childhood I dreamed of Playstation.
Shout out to Tom Hiddleston for doing amazing performance 💯
10/10... What a ending.. I enjoyed watching this incredible show.
Im convinced Loki is a simp by his actions. Sylvie gonna mess up the entire time line cause she holds grudges. Ain't no way I'm holding these timelines to keep them àlive and she over there galavanting with the next god. Talking about I'm the reason Loki ain't here no more. Nahhh either you hold these branches so I CAN LIVE. Or you gotta go to that uppperrr room. Couldn't be me I tell ya
Thanks for explaining, great season.
please i really need the xbox 🤞🏾
loki being the only thing that keeps the multiverse is literally a metaphor for the current state of the mcu rn
Just an amazing series,10/10 for sure
Comment
Loki become one with the tree of life(time line) at the end of time. He become the god which we all want to see. Become the most powerful characters.
The first thing Loki selfishly wanted was a throne. The last thing Loki selflessly wanted was a throne. In the end he was burdened with glorious purpose to selflessly sit on the throne. Brilliant writing.
What a great finale
I’m speechless after this season of Loki.. 20 out of 10.. it breaks any scale.. my goodness..
Gang
Your explanation helped BIG TIME!!!!! thank you!
10 out of 10
MCU needs to do whatever they can to preserve and protect this series and Loki as a whole 10/10 i loved this series so much
Good writing... Loki doesn't win... however he doesn't necessarily lose neither,  he merely finds a glorious purpose
Well explain 👍
10 😈💪🏾
Loki kind of jumped out of a series and into a fight for the top 5 Marvel movies of all-time.   It's definitely the greatest hero-arc to date
This show better be nominated for Emmys. This is Cinema, idgaf what anyone says.
Good thing they didnt even bother puting any woke propaganda bullshit into it, thinking the series is going to be boring. And the result was glorious. For 2 seasons only, this got to be the only good  superhero tv series to date. No show comes close
Wonder if we'll see some other characters stumble upon Loki later on. Like they go to the center of the multiverse and discover an incredibly old Loki holding the multiverse together still after eons
Ps5 yess please
Loki gets way too much hate, theres definitely a lot of garbage from Marvel but this one is a homerun
basically this is the end of loki , we will never see him acting again for mcu gg bros
I was not expecting that ending... ❤❤❤❤❤❤ I love Loki!!
Loki sacrificed himself by choosing to be alone at the end of time, the one thing he said he fears most was to be alone but he had to in order to save his friends
This finale blew my mind. I can’t wait to see what comes next. Loki is amazing as a character and Tom Huddleston is a phenomenal actor.
does it mean that loki have single-handed ending the Incursion so that anyone travel the multiverse and not to have the universe to die
Think you missed a key point. Ruling the nine realms was his stated goal from the beginning. His antics in Avengers and Thor were vain attempts at taking over by force. What really sets this series apart is that actually fulfills that goal. Loki is now the default ruler of the multiverse not what the strength of his arm but with the strength of his will and life. One can even surmise that the image we saw of Yggdrasil is being powered by this loki since time can be thought of as a casual loop. Did loki really free everyone from a predetermined future or are we just filling in pieces to a larger mystery?
God of free will
Loki is the goat
Best series of 2023 😬😬
Will he just be there forever now?
wow. now give me ps5
I still think he who remains planned all of this cause him even knowing Loki could pause time eventually and also his first offer when he met them saying you take over the tva I mean at the end of the day everything is going as planned Loki is running the tva now and took her who remains place and just like we know all the universes are still there and the movie kang dynasty and secret wars are still coming so another war with the kangs is still in play like when you think about it Loki did nothing i think all of this happened before like why you think he who remains said only you can run it Loki cause like he said he's seen. Everything and knows everything I think it's all still part of the act I hope I'm making sense someone please comment on this and tell me if this makes sense cause that's what I got out of everything we know like the kang war is still going to happen and it all still seems to be going as planned lol
Why can’t all of the MCU be as good as Loki
This series is amazing
Loki is the best series. Change my mind
They've captured lightning in a bottle with this show. When you stop pandering and start focusing on the story. Incredible work.
Odin would be so proud
Definitely 100 sure loki is saviour of mcu and loki is now super herooo🔥🔥🔥
You missed an option. Loki proposed one of his own, and He Who Remains informed him that it would lead to an unwinnable, unpredictable war.
Loki also got his throne at the end.
Incredible episode
Masterful writing and acting!!! 👍🏾
Best marvel series !
Still don’t get it. If when the loom is destroyed all the branches die, why is there a need for the loom in the first place?
Loki is the example of what the MCU could and should be!
Loki is basically the embodiment of Multiverse so maybe he'll be the only one who can hold a candle to all of the Kang variants. I think he's definitely going to have an important role in Kang Dynasty aside from maybe Ant-Man.
10 asgard protected the realms known as a tree Loki turns the timeline into a tree Odin style baby
What a great series!
it was a clean video

Warren is so good!
Super awesome! Excited te see what happens next.
As much as Loki likes to consider himself a God, he's really just a tiny Frost Giant who was adopted by Odin and taught magic by Frigga.  I wonder what makes him so special that he's alone experienced time slipping and was able to control it without use of technological devices?   Also, i love how Loki's time slipping is really similar to Miles Morales' 'glitching', but Miles can't use it to travel through time and space like Loki can.
Satisfying ending
I’m assuming every single time line would have an igdrasil(excuse the spelling) and since he is holding almost an infinite amount of time lines wouldn’t he be greater than the igdrasil?
The Thor fanboys are gonna be mad that Loki became as powerful as Wanda and he can beat Thor without a doubt now
For me, Loki series rated 10/0 💥
I thought this season was crap, I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings 😂
They killed it.  Take care all.  Rating, 9
They gave themselves some space to recast Kang here.
What a beautiful ending for such a legendary character. He truly fulfilled his redemption arc. I hope we get to see Tom Hiddleston portray Loki again, but I’m totally okay if this is the last time we see him.
Awesome video
Loki be carrying MCU hard with this s2 finale.
Best thing about Loki is taking time to actually learn advanced engineering.
best series in the mcu universe ❤❤
Loki = He who remains
10/10 series
Just 10 there is no way it deserves any less perfection so Marvel dead what a joke I didn't think you could top session 1 I was so wrong perfect
Loki The Living Loom He Who Contains God of Stories God of Time The One Who Sits Above Time  My man 🥹
So satisfied with this ending!!
Wouldnt it be great to see a Special presentation about Loki how he learned physics from O.B. in all these years? Like where and how he lived .
Well they can't say Kang isn't menacing anymore... WOW!! I watched this episode on shrooms and man that entire scene at the citadel was a thing of beauty. Episode6 is a masterpiece now all Marvel has to do is place HWR variants in numerous projects b4 KD because this just paved the road for so much
If you go back and watch Loki in the first avengers movie it’s such a different character in every way. What an evolution
it was amazing finale...
10/10
brings up a crazy question. Was the MCU we knew before or always Loki's MCU?
amazing viceos
8.9 of 10
What a great finale to Marvels best show Loki!
Loved the Ending.  Very Well Explained...Thanks @TheCosmicWonder...I understand it better now
I love you Loki
10 out of 10. Amazing 👏
I actually was surprised "this" was the finally of the season / perhaps these series...   Basically what Loki did, is "his path" created the path where "He Who Remains" will walk on across the different timelines where Loki is now presenting the future, that's the beginning of the past events. By "saving all the timelines", he has created all the Kang variants who will do the most damage, until "HWR" will handle everything again, where Loki and the smoke monster will battle again, HWR wins (with the help of his love) and restart it all again.
This show is phenomenal. Best thing marvel has done in a while
Meh... 6.5/10
This video really helped me to explain the final episode better, thank you, and if you can't choose someone for the ps5 I volunteer 🥺
This is the best series in years
This episode was so dynamic I am still in awe of it 🤩
Learning physics for centuries...that's a whole new level of commitment 😅😂
FVCk the sorcerer supreme... the greatest magic wielder LOKI
Let’s get it!
I feel so lucky that I live in the same timeline as this show. It’s fantastic!
Nothing but pure badass concentrated will
Loki has sacrifice his freedom to keep all the time line safe
Loki just topped iron man in sacrificial plays in the MCU
That was a wild episode, thanks for helping unravel it.
LOKIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
I thought wanda was gonna be the master of multiverse or reality warping etc... But loki, oh my oh my, Next Level 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Idk I didn’t like it at all idk if it’s because I never read the comics so I was so confused throughout the season and I feel like it was just a way to cut Jonathan majors out the mcu
Truly is a great series
I definitely give it a 10. Very well done!
What about the Council of Loki's?
This is a great ending to all MCU movies, but it's up to you if you wat to watch multiversal wars
best written character in the mcu now we know why the time stone is green
why there is always a women behind a man's sacrifices, because of her our beloved loki has to sacrifice so that everyone can live including his love..it should be her sacrifice she should have sacrificed , she started this she should have ended it.....Ohh man my heart felt sadness i wntd to cry when i saw him his face at the end...what a sacrifice he has made! he is A True God...
In captain America the first avenger I think red skull refers to the tree of life in the first scene when busting down the front door of that church
Amazing Episode. Love the reference to Kang from 616 at the end. Marvel really should lean more into this type of writing.
10
Loki is what we love about Marvel. So excited to see what comes next! Great video!
What an incredible series… I’m stunned. Honestly might be marvels best project to date, and I mean including the Infinity Saga
Omg he did amazing The end omg he saved everyone
Bruh I’m so confused 😂
Best character in MCU, evey othe mcu show is dead af
The cast was absolutely incredible this season and most the writing as well.
The whole Loki series just blew me away. I really was NOT expecting this level of mindf*ck and expert writing. Best MCU Disney+ series, period. 🙏
Why he who remains didn't kill sylvie
What a great ending for Loki !!!
great content, trying to get that ps5 though haha
"Loki has finally learned that the pathway to becoming truly worthy is placing others' well-being above his own".
hope I win
Greatest story the MCU has ever told. “My life has been a giant waste of time” then mans becomes time itself. Ourobouros was a very fitting name for the first episode of this season, a snake eating its own head basically sums up the whole season. From the elevator scene, to the tva guidebook, to Loki literally becoming he who remains just by trying to stop him. The irony, the use of time travel, impeccable. Whoever was on the writing for this was definitely a comic book fan who got the point of comics back in the 70s-80s. Never thought we would get a story like this on screen, happy they had the balls to do it. Masterpiece.
It was good. Mostly aesthetically crazy!!! In a good way. The transformation to his throne was BEAUTIFUL!! They could’ve given us a post credit scene but it’s all good lol.
A great explanation and the character Loki is marvelous and everything was so good
The scene of him becoming the world tree was simply incredible
How is secret wars going to happen if the multiverse is now the world tree?
so Loki is all father now?
Bro finally had ascended to his throne for glorious purpose. Except this time it was for a different reason
sacrifice
Thor took the full force of a dying star. Looking took the full force of a dying multiverse.   In other mythology he would be atlas holding the earth....or multiverse in this case. NOTE: The sacred timeline is a mulitverse but a finite one. The new sacred tree is a larger finite mulitverse.
Awesome explanation 😮
Ps5
i like loki
It was okay until I seen Hank Mccoy 💯
the entire finale episode was just amazing i could hardly even talk(i tend to do that sometimes)
Character development at its finest.
Loki setting the bar too high that I doubt ECHO will match
Loved loki more than the movies they release easily 10/10
This episode was amazing. I feel for Loki. I mean he finally got his throne, but at what cost…
What happened with Renslayer at the end?
If you noticed MCU Loki from the start, he always wanted to rule, be whatever it is, he always wanted to rule though he's earliest intentions weren't good enough, after character development journey,cut back to now he is kind of ruling everything with good intentions though, his purpose of like is fullfilled to rule. Just my theory!
Great video but i have one question. If kang was controlling everything why he gave loki the choice to change everything?
The acting and writhing of this series is just so good
This is the marvel I miss
This was my favorite episode.
I think there is a big mistake in this show. Loki was incredibly nerfed since season 1, he barely could handle regular humans, so its kind of delusional think he has power enough to "keep life" in the multiverse. There are another other plot holes like he sending Victor to save the loom and dying when he could do it without a suit but he keep insisting on that.
thank you for always helping us understand these shows! You rock my friend!
goated series
Loki is the best thing happened after Endgame, it's fresh, new, and Glorious!
Such next level story writing and screen performance.   Chef's kiss to the writers and entire team.  I was captivated the entire season.  This is what we need from the MCU.  Less humor and no more formula writing!
Definitely helped 👍
Great breakdown!
I swear this series gives me hope that the MCU really isn't dead yet lmao it was awesome
i cant help but feel for loki. that’s such an ultimate sacrifice. but i think about how he was always afraid to be alone. now he is alone, sitting there, no food or water, just himself. alone.
Why was the branch so small when Loki took it in his hands?
best analysis
let's go
This was a sick finale
the god of stories Loki
Loki is essentially the “Watcher”. He probably can’t act in each Time line, but i believe he’d be able to gather heroes to combat new threats the way the watcher did in what if
Loki going crazy and carrying the MCU, fun fact the Timeline Tree kinda symbolizes Yggdrasil which has all 9 realms in Norse Mythology.
👌🏿🇭🇹🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
too much burden for loki. i feel sorry for him and i hated it. but i know, he is the most powerful being in the multiverse, thats it.
Anothee "WHAT IF" in my brain!
Great video!  I understand it little differently. I mean what life does timeline needs?? It isn't real tree, but timelines. What happened (I think) is Multiverse gets free and different variants of Kang(and others) starts  fight between each other, just like HWR prophesied and started destroy Multiverse. Loki catch one branch and try to change its course but because other branches are connect, they attack it and kill it again, so Loki takes them all and start to guide them all, preventing events that could destroy Multiverse. Kangs don't go to war against each other, they exil troublemaker (s) and create council. Council exist because Loki prevents them to fight against each other. (Quite ironic) Multiverse continue grow and Loki needs to keep it in control, both protecting it and letting people have free will. New job of TVA is basically assist Loki and make sure, they will not go out of control. This way he keeps timelines alive. But that's just my understanding, I'm probably wrong.
What happened to renslayer
Best series in MCU :)
🎉 awesome show!!! Yup,cant beat time, or the people that control it,maybe able to keep....till( if kang dynasty) or Doom!!!!
Thank you Loki for letting us all exist. ❤❤
My mind is officially blown .
Woww This movie is so fantastic! I'm from Indonesia, I have subscribe your channel! Hope I'm lucky 😁
Great ending to a great show very excited for what’s to come in the MCU.
This show has definitely got me back on marvel after that bad run there. I'm watching the marvels as soon as possible now 😅 didn't see that coming
LOKI WAS GREAT!!!!
I view Loki series as the true next phase. Everything else was just white noise in the mcu multiverse 😂
he has finally earned the throne
Please let me get that ps5 :D
Loki is literally carrying the mcu on his back
Loki God of stories ❤
He who remains is still better than Kang the conqueror🤷
Loki has so many abilities at this point he's clearly the most powerful being in the MCU. I'm sure he can also create a duplicate of himself in astral form that is able to leave his throne if he wanted to. My guess for kang dynasty is the TVA fails and he's forced to open up some of the various timelines he's holding to recruit avengers level heroes. I also expect a lot of his recruiting to happen in post credit scenes just like in the early days when Nick Fury was recruiting the OG avengers.
Amazing
"I thought loki died in infinity war what is happening?" - Everyone during secret wars
1 out of 10 , a 20
He was finally burdened with glorious purpose.
this is what marvel is..❤❤❤
Loki - The God of Timelines.... The best character development I have ever seen from a pure evil villain to a selfless hero.
Loki became the 3 eyed raven
Hi  bro, wish i could win that giveaway but this is my first time watching your channel anyway love the series he officialy carries the mcu now
Glorious burden
Third choice: Let nature be as it was intended and destroy every version of Kang.
love your show keep grinding 💯
Loki once said this to Thanos: "You never be a God". Little did Thanos know Loki would become the God of Multiverse.
terrible ending
You guys need to stop doubting Marvel, because when they give you a crazy episode like this just says stay loyal and true. Best finale ever, stop the bullshit and stay true, like you are not a true fan if your left and right about Marvel, instead of keeping it real.
He wasn't even suppose to make any movies after avengers but the public spoke we wanted more loki and marvel delivered in an unbelievably epic way. I never saw this coming this was GREAT writing
" he who remains" now
One thing I keep asking, why did he who remains put this plan into motion, what was his end goal, to have Loki ruling with him?? He clearly wanted to show him everything
This is one of the better series that helps to set up other parts of the mcu. Awesome ending!
“I know champ”  He Who Remains wrote all of this out and gave Loki his powers to basically replace him so he would be free to travel and wreak havoc or help with the variant war.  This has also happened before that’s why HWR told him he likes this version of him better than the other one he had to deal with
Does this mean that Loki, in a way, is also the Watcher of the multiverse. If he’s able to know what’s going on with everything, he could be their live action adaptation
They turn it up to an 11 on this episode ,this season really
Can't wait for secret wars now!
One of the best.....❤❤❤❤
Loki - god of the multiverse 🔥🔥🔥
Loki creates the tree that Thor explains to Jane in the first Thor movie.
This is how you end a series. This episode was a grand slam and everything they did was perfect. Good dam Tom can act!
The only thing is  how can he hold those timelines and gives energy to them ? how his magic became suddenly energy for that many timelines ? expanding the loom is ok as he spent centuries learning but ultimately saying he will hold the entire time lines (unlimited or infinite) and giving energy to them is not at all looks ok.Suddenly time lines became some threads and he picked those threads and gives life to them ? how he got the energy required for giving life to a time line ? We are praising Thor for holding the energy of 1 neutron star and there are billions of those stars in one time line and loki gave energy to those infinite time lines?  don't know why people loving the ending so much but anyway there are no shitty jokes and there are very exiting things in the season2(like he who remains is the one who written it, Infact I thought about how he let silvi to kill him that easily, The scenes like these are which we need.).But still they can have a better logical and explained ending than this. 7/10 for me.
Zo, Loki  is basically, that guy
I love tragic love stories. Thank you Marvel, and thank you Loki series.
this season for loki was just top tier, love it!!
This series really was something special. The ending to Lokis character in this finale honestly makes me get a bit teary just thinking about it 😅 dude went from evil killer to the lifeforce of the multiverse so infinite amounts of life can live. What a beautiful ending to the character, I onow they will have to being him back eventually cuz the world needs the pay off of Loki seeing Thor again saying "i told you the sun would shine on us again" but at the same time i really hope they keeo this as the end of the show. With s01e01 and s2e6 being the same name i hope that does kinda hint that this be the end now
loved the series, but it think the whole story could have been completed within 2 episodes lol
That scene where Loki is pulling the timelines together parallels the scene where his brother ignites the forge to make Stormbreaker. Both scenes mirror each other as they both level up, in a sacrificial way.
C r a z y
Great episode
How can He who remains pause time out side of time? That's some Beyonder technology or ability.
This was an amazing episode, even without a mid credit or end credit scene.
giveaway 👀
can we just end the multiverse... its becoming unoriginal and annoying... thats mainly why marvel failed since endgame...
The entire series was nothing but chills. Will we ever see him again?🫤
Good episode
The Chanel New Rockstars called it . They said Loki will end up being the God of Stories. Absolute banger of a finale
ps5
"Say my name!" LOKI!!
The season finale was incredible and impressive! The last episode was a 10/10. The entire season was a 8/10
I loved the entire story, that’s my favourite series ever… however the fact that Loki, a god became the one above all the stories is disappointing… they could at least make he who remains slipping in time to thank Loki. I repeat: a human that rule the multiverse is inspiring, a god no. And he who remains could’ve been at least the one setting up Loki’s destiny. But hey very good stuff, just a little predictable the end, that i predicted 2 years ago (the fact that Loki is the one who always lose but always survives and remains) i was hoping i was wrong but:  🎶 in the end it doesn’t even matter 🎵
Ok your breakdown made me upgrade my rating to a 9 😂
OK uni+ valid
This is so insane i could ask for a better ending than this honestly !
we all know Loki is going to find away back.
Loki ALMIGHTY PULL even greater then Tobey Maguire train pull 🚝🕸 Loki god of 🕰🌲 Time tree Odin god of 🌎🌲 Worlds tree Thor god of ⚡🌲 Thunder tree
Loki became what he truly was: The god of stories and the keeper of destiny
It’s one of the most wonderful endings in the MCU 🥳🥳💪💪
Fantastic series. Probably a 9/10, great plot, great acting, especially Jonathan Majors as Victor was fantastic, a completely different character/Kang then he was in the last 2 apperances. Really hope they won't ditch him. The series is wihout a doubt one of Marvel's top products made, for sure beside the last spiderman movie the best thing since Endgame.
Loki is 3000% my favorite show now! Well done to the Loki team  with the writing, actors/actresses etc! They have done so well
Man that was epic Loki went God mode anime style it was perfect he created a whole multiverse and it tree l am just speechless was sitting in suspense the whole time
When Mobius said "Ill just sit here and let time pass by" is essentially what loki will be doing forever
one thing I don't understand is why Loki didn't get spaghetti'd when everyone else does...or  Sylvie when the mcdonaldsverse gets spaghetti'd
It will be so cool to see thor some how finding out that Loki is holding the multiverse together and then goes to the TVA and finds him setting on the throne holding everything together
Great Video!
10
Good breakdown
This should have been a movie and marvels should have been a show
So our Loki can't leave ever? Is the actor done playing him?
Yesterday I watched Thor 1 avenegers 1 then all of Loki and the last episode came out right when I was done and man Loki had a journey
I enjoyed this series
That's a huge life risk he who remains took, and failed. Why did he do that? 😊
10 it was amazing He basically did what he did in the beginning of infinity war.
Broke my heart that after such development he still ended up ALONE!
Battle world already exist. There are pieces of pruned timelines in the void. Now it looks like revona remembers what the lioth is or else she would have  been scared when she woke up and saw it
I wish Thor could see just how far his brother came , he'd be so proud that loki is doing something good , not for his personal gain.
What happened to Victor Timely at the end? And didn't they alude to Renslayer seeing Alioth at the end of time, so I assume she will be back for Kang Dynasty and/or Secret Wars?
Loki was so good, I want more!!
Loki became THE GOD ! how is that bot strange ?
Boring af show could be condensed into 2 epis
Wow. Loki Season 2 is so good
Loki is best Marvel show ever!!
What a good final … who’s thinking of this character evolution…   From a Baby taken by Odin from Lofey.. hated as villain in avengers  Now he is the keeper of the multiverse… odin would be proud   Edit: Thanos would be now never beat the holder of nultiverse 😅
i knew it i said it first loki was setted up to be loki the god of stories,and if he does end up making the multiverse avenger that makes him avengers prime,also the time line turned to a tree a good nod to where the tessaract was hidden in capt america 1 haha
The whole time though, I kept thinking, why didnt he ask Sylvie to look into his memories, maybe that would have made for an interesting story aswell. However, I loved this series so much, just amazing work.
You forgot to talk about Asgardian get stronger when they got older. I think the scene that shows he got older is important too. It shows how much stronger loki can get.
Look like I'm the only one that wasn't really feeling this last episode. I rate it a 8 tho it was good but I'm not calling it great
Can you deliver it in Uganda 😔😔😔
This new version of Loki is my favorite so far! I love that for him😍
i creid ngl
Amazing finish! What did they do with Victor?
😮
My Question is Will Loki be a part of Secret Wars and will he be the most important character in that movie?
9
it was absolutely amazing
Best MCU production since Infinity War
Are they gonna go with a Avenger Prime story line?
10
This finale just removed Kang from anything going forward.  Next up Dr. Doom!
still in awe. But I think they found a way to replace jonathan majors, if needed. i got mixed feelings about that i think jm is dope as kang personalities him, loki and owen wilson made this series a classic
Great season 1+2 Great Loki 🎉
Honestly, the show was stellar,  the fact a TV show far outshines the movies is insane!!!
As much as didn’t like the ending of the first season this was a great plan by Kang
Thor 5 - kang is coming for Loki at the end of time. Sylvie finds Thor and tells him. Thor goes to find and protect Loki from this Kang.
He became heart of ydridrisal
Basically we have two seasons of a show just to gender swap Loki? I don't know what is worse, just doing it like Sprite and Taskmaster or spending hundreds of millions and several years to do it.
Yea the one good episode
I just wished he got a chance to meet thor again like how tony got a chance to speak with his dad. He's grown, i wonder how he would react seeing his brother who he hated so much. But that seems impossible plotwise
Best thing marvel has put out all year.
Oh at least 8.5/10, but arguably one of the best of the series.
This is a great place to get closure on the MCU and step away.  It was really good.  Great place to have a fond memory.
Can you please explain captain Marvel 2 Post credit scene
This series was chefs kiss.
10/10 series AND mabye thats why the time stone is green
This finale has to be one of the most bittersweet yet satisfying ending.
Maybe instead of Loki, we will see Sylvie in Secret Wars... She still got HWR tempad and I think Sylvie will soon learn how to control time too. If not, manipulate it at least.
Wait, does this mean Loki can now use Thor's hammer? Not that he needs it now but it would be nice to see Thor's face if he picks it up. He'd be the last person Thor would expect to wield it.
I have beeen waiting and you too but in the end it was amazing
it’s just like something i never expected like i already knew that the concept of this series was already bigger than the entire mcu but i never expected loki to literally be the entire basis of the mcu at the end of it it’s just insane idk how to feel about it
They nerfed the shit out of Loki all through phase 4 all the way up to here, we seen some of his power but we never got to see the extent of his power, now we're seeing it, Loki is a beast and this series is awesome, finally some good Marvel writing instead of twerking and shit!
He’s the Watcher
10/10 Simply amazing
This was kind of a sad ending, but I accept it. He is a lifegiver instead of a lifestealer. What character development!!!!!!!
We forgive you Marvel. I’m just sad that Kang might be out of the MCU.
He was born for glorious purpose and he didn't lie  Fyi i am not crying I'm having an allergic reaction to this moment
Will loki return
Best script thus far. Really like to see loki finally founds his glorious purpose. Like your breakdown btw. Thanks.
Awesome video 🎉
A perfect 10/10 series every episode had suspense and intent on top of that the acting was perfection and the film set and colour grading was top notch
This ep was the best
So a multiversal war is imminent now since Loki didn't want to take the throne....
This is great episode 10/10.
Loved how you explained it! I gave it a 9 cause it has to be perfect for a 10. For it to get a 10, there’s one question I wanted answered. Why? Why did he who remains put Loki through all this. Did he want him to become what he did, holding all the branches and giving them life? There’s more to it for sure
The season finale really surprised me ngl, wasn't expecting it to be any good and it turned out to be a fantastic ending for the series and for the character itself as well.
So is it that Loki has now integrated the newly formed branches into Yggdrasil and has become the source of power for tree?
It means multiversal travel is allowed now under Loki's Yggdrasil without incursion?
PS5
Loki
Amazing season..
Can't wait scream in the cinema when loki appears in secret wars . My favorite avenger know. Iron , sorry.
Would be very interesting if they take the Battle World route with Secret Wars to end the multiverse saga and have DOOM take Lokis power to combine the universes into one.
I think Loki will learn to project a version of himself on any timeline or universe, like a hologram trick he has
Great finale!
Loki is why I still love marvel as much beside a few characters. I don’t get it. You have an amazing crew of writers for this show. While other movies are failing. They need to have that feeling of major loss. This is what Antman was missing. We needed to be scared of Kang. And the outcome it would cost. But I didn’t get that feeling.
Loved the finale, he really is the God of the Multiverse
Didn't this show just come out?
He is literally a soul king in MCU😮
Best best best ❤
I think Marvel nailed the entire season. The acting, the story (both complexity and connectivity), the cinematography…it was all spot on. This has made me a lot more excited for the multiverse saga.
Lol, this is so dumb. So his arc is he ends up sitting in a chair for eternity holding rope.
I think he who remains knew that loki will sacrifice himself, when they were having the conversation, he who remains doesn't force loki to make the choice he gives instead he let loki makes the choice himself, i guess he who remains knew that loki will sacrifice himself so at the end if their conversation he who remains makes a nonchalant smile ( i feel he who remains will not be burdened anymore knowing he will  be replaced)
Great breakdown, incredible finale
Best character arc in the MCU
i dont understand why not kill slyvie and let hwr live and everything back to the first place ?
I like how they ended this, they haven't directly linked in to anything or set anything up, they had a satisfying ending but have still left things open ended at the same time. Like they have got characters in a place where if they don't use them for a while it makes sense and they can just bring any of them back at any time and I believe it would be easy for that to make sense too. Like loki is in a position where he could stay there for a few movies but no doubt people will want him back so they can literally just bring him back no problem. I honestly love how they done this whole show as it whole separate story instead of everything else that's constantly crossing over for no reason.
Good episode but it needed a miss minutes explanation at the end so watching this made it better.
It was so good enjoyed every episode!
Easily the most enjoyable Marvel series to date. I didn’t think that Season 1 could be topped, but they’ve just done so well with Loki.
i loved the series but I can see where some find it confusing. I don't think they really did it much justice explaining how he comes into the time-slipping powers.  In the comics, in the Earth-X series it was revealed that Loki and the other asgardian gods were actually formless aliens who had evolved so much that they could essentially become anything but I guess they lacked direction or creativity and imagination to choose their forms. When they visited Earth they were greeted by a Norse man named Donnerson who was the lame duck of the village and looked upon as worthless except for recording their histories.   While others fled, Donnerson greeted the aliens thinking them to be gods. Mephisto visited Donnerson and offered him the power to become Odin Borson and give shape to Asgard. In the present day of the Earth-X alternate universe Loki would be one of the first to learn this truth and shed his Loki form realizing he could be any form he wanted. He sought to bring this realization to Thor and other asgardians but they mocked him and chalked it up as another one of his ruse as the longstanding "god of mischief" and chief-orchestrator of lies.  It was revealed in the Earth-X series that almost the opposite of He Who Remains who sought to keep everything to one sacred timeline, Mephisto sought to created or expand the multiverse as a means to have other worlds to escape too. Mephisto was of the same or similar alien race but unlike Loki who shed his storybook told destiny, Mephisto was still under the influence that he was the literal devil. And as that devil, he manipulated others, offering them a change of their destiny (usually for their soul) ultimately so he could create more branch timelines.  I think this series, with Loki sort of evolving to have these time-slipping powers was really a very similar relation to the Earth-X revelation that he was not bound to be Loki, but that he could be so much more. Somehow he unlocked his mutation to become what was needed and as simply just a Loki he could have never done that but as an awakened version of himself he could be whatever he wanted to be.   I do love how they warped him to be the image of Yggdrasil. That was pretty cool.   Although I would think that if he could evolve to pause time and time slip in a place without time, that he really shouldn't need a temp pad and would also be able to jump around to any place in time and any universe. Also keep in mind that he has long had the ability to project illusions of himself. If he is so powerful as to be the conduit of the multiverse, I would imagine he could project and image of himself and speak to anyone anywhere if he wants.   Who knows, we may see a future connection in a What If season of the Watchers to this Loki. That would be cool too.  But going back to the Earth X series, it really did give me Mephisto vibes when Loki cast his horned helmet this time in black (made me think of the devil Legend) and walked with a tentacled cape to sit on a throne.   I guess a possible future Loki series (though i believe they must be done) could see this Loki get dethroned by Mephisto and possibly Mephisto revealed to be a variant of Loki. I know that's not paying homage to comic accuracy but it kind of stands to reason that if He Who Remains placed himself at the center of a Sacred Timeline to cut off all of his variants who are now loose and will be responsible for a multiversal war, that Loki's own variants, some could evolve similarly to how he has in this series and seek to dethrone him just as the Kangs do to each other. Just a thought.  I would love to see a Kid Loki make a comeback as a mainstay in the MCU.
Impor-tent
I was blown away by this finale
Me coming to see if he gets a good or at least a half good ending cause if it isn’t I’m done with the mcu forever  Edit: I’m just confused he turns into a tree? Is he stuck in the tree? Can he come out if he wants to? HOW WILL HE DO ANYTHING? well at least he’s alive I guess
Only tv show that Disney got right
Loki was great series MCU hit it off
this is ep is masterpiece, now wheres my ps5 lol
fire
Loki IS Jesus
Loki holding onto all the timelines reminds me of one of his titles: The god of stories.
It’s a 9. I really thought I was playing a video game. Just trying over and over again. Trying something new the beat the game. That’s what this episode reminded me of.
I really like Jonathan Majors as an actor, seeing the type of person Victor was made me feel bad for all the bad things that he had to experience, and he was such a wholesome character!
I could very much see (although it might not be as exciting for people) Loki being done and a show called TVA being brought to life in an Agents of Shield format. They would go through time to take care of the troubling but not Avenger level Kang variants. I just don’t think it would have legs without Loki playing a part however.
Awesome episode, thanks for the breakdown
amazing scene at the last of the episode NOTHING LIKE THAT i think this was the greatest thing ever in marvel
so no loki and thor reunion?
Imma say the same thing I put on your other video on the finale…SHIT JUST GOT REAL!!!
That was hands down the best thing mavel has done in a while plus giving Loki the full circle story arch...wow just wow
This was trash.  Now Kang isnt a threat at all.
Hopefully loki has a comodo nearby
what about renslayer
It was definitely a 10/10
Loki has been my favorite Marvel Character since Avengers. His character development arch is so amazing and the model great writing. Mr Hiddleston is an amazing actor and performed Loki to perfection.
This final episode.... ugh idk what to feel. But it was definitely breath taking
that was lowkey a really good series
The whole episode was kinda meh. Lol
Is loki essentially the watcher???
Loved the ending. They also left themselves an out if the Jonathan majors thing goes south.. 10 out of 10 the episode and the series
The power of Loki is now the sap of Yggdrasil and maintains the cosmos and the flow of time. It is also Ouroboros, as it is key to Odin’s story and thus its own history.
What’s happen to the miss minutes going crazy part ???
Loki was definitely different
I’m still a little upset he didn’t get to reunite with Thor
When I seen the asteroid he who remains was at in the back ground I figured that loki would do that
Loki : God of stories 👑            saviour of MCU🔥💚
Loki is giving them time to beat Kang
The god of stories is born awesome character development he's now sitting on a higher throne than oden did
I Want that XBOX!!!!!!
🤯🤯🤯 awesome 👏🏾
Honestly the thing the I find depressing is the thing Sif said came true "You are alone Loki and you always will be." It's so sad.
Not only that, but has anybody realize that both Loki and the time stone are both green? 😆 and because of what he’s learned, he’s not so narcissistic anymore isn’t that great? 😂 or how soon do you think it will take until he snaps and wants to go back in time again? 🤷‍♀️ because he’s bored and wants to be or have a companion?
Amazing series ❤❤
Loved it! 10!!!
Loki didn’t “win” he changed the formula, he wanted his friends. He never wanted his throne, he wanted love/ friendship, instead he’s alone. What a Beautiful ending.
Honestly the most awesome MCU Disney plus show! Also… Yggdrasil 🤯 The Norse mythology meters exploded in my lil brain
Loki's new Helm of darkness, the Throne, the multiverse train. It was so perfect🤌🤌 Reminds me of "One who wears the Crown bears the Crown". Can't believe it's over. I want more!!!
If anyone would told me in 2012 that Loki would be the saviour of entire MCU, I would have laughed....god of Stories indeed...
I was hoping Loki would become a Nick Fury type figure recruiting avengers from other universes to stop the other Kings
after watching this my mind is dead
Great explanation, loved the episode!
In the first Thor movie, Loki wanted to ascend the throne of Asgard to rule the Nine Realms. In the season finale, he ascended to the throne at the end of time and wove the looms of time into the shape of Yggdrasil, which is the tree that holds the Nine Realms in Norse mythology.  In the end, Loki got everything he ever wanted, and more. Chills.
love your commentary on the loki season 2 finale.
loki reviving marvel again
I'm calling it, Loki will recruit the best heroes from other multiverses to defeat all Kang variants.
Next. Somehow we need Loki to return and at least see Thor
Will Loki be in Deadpool 3?
10!
I would like the Xbox I'm from South Africa and Never be able to afford  a xbox😅
What a phenomenal ending. My heart aches for loki because he didn't want to be alone but ended up sacrificing that for his friends. I really do hope we see more of him.
There is a fully grown victor timely still at the tva.....isn't that dangerous?
God of multiverse
11
i wish loki reunited with thor
So who sacrificed more iron man or loki???
Actually Yggdrasil came up already in "Captain America - The First Avenger". It was the place in the church, where the tesseract was hidden in. Nice story link again. Hopefully the rest of the MCU stories catch up with this finale to get back to where it once was.
Loki is the AVENGER PRIME!!!!
The Loki series depicts the comics in the way a 2 hr movie can’t. Idk if it’s a hot take but both seasons, imo best marvel project easily
The MCU is back!!! Loki saved me from agony
literally the OMEGA.
Hands down the best series out right now.
excellent breakdown, I'm definitely going to send this to someone. Also this ep was easily a 10/10
Warren!!! Dude that was an awesome epic finale! How he became the god of stories in the end like the comics
If you told me in 2012 that Loki would become not a master of death or mischief but a master of love and selfless sacrifice who has put his own wants and needs for the happiness and love of billions of others from infinite timelines, I’d have laughed at you. But over the years, Tom Hiddleston has masterfully made Loki just a character from 2011 into my most beloved by 2023 and if this is his end, how poetic.
It's also a reference to the change comic Loki makes to stop being The God of Tricks & Lies and to instead become The God of Stories & Myths
Give me my Xbox bruh💀💀
This was sooo good!❤❤❤
Kangs are all dead?
Didn’t like - it’s like 3 episodes into 5 Min
If he's giving life doesn't that make him the strongest? Maybe other than he who remains.  Plus if he can do all this doesn't he have the ability to watch, make illusions of himself to wander around the grounds all the while feeding life?
Thank you for this video. It really explains what happened in the last episode. He only sad thing about it all is Loki does not get free will and literally becomes a slave to the multiverse. I would have liked to have seen Loki and Silvie be together and live out their free will together. But I guess not.
Best series marvel has put out! So happy to see things turning around!
To me Loki has always been like a background character, but not at the same time. Now, turning into the tree of life?! Now that’s insane. IGN 10/10
Loki having every timeline where he can look after Thor is so heartwarming. His character development is the best mcu has done. Excited to see what the future holds!
Such an epic finale!!
Even though this is a great episode, I really hope that Loki would have a better ending than this, I mean sitting there just watching until eternity? Mah boi Loki deserves more than that.
But in the end, Loki dies by thanos😢
I really love the ending of Loki Season 2. Loki Season 2 is by far the best show Marvel has put out, I really hope moving forward, Marvel can go back to its roots.
Atleast he got his throne better than asgard 😅
Everyone keeps saying loki saved the MCU the MCU never needed saving it’s just you guys can’t adapt to new stuff. Every show that has came out is introducing new characters and taking away old ones.
Guys.....He who remains trucked Loki into replacing him....he's still....just a Kang.
Man, God of time Loki is broken af, the episode was 100/10 ain't gonna lie, was way above my expectations
Bro you slipping it real good
I loved it 8/10
I was sitting on my couch watching *THAT* scene thinking how is this not a movie?? Beautiful finale, Marvel outdid themselves 👏🏾👏🏾
10/10
Just curious how long can Loki give life to these timelines? Did his magic changed? Or his magic never drains because there’s no time in where he is?
Love this show so much. I can rewatch this show over and over. Love your channel Warren thanks for all the videos  Cheers
10
Out of all the sorcerers: Dr Strange, Wong, Wanda, Agnes...Loki is the most powerful.
HWR said he would end up right back where he was after the multiversal war.  The loop has started.  But we don’t know if this time the loop will end up with Kang sitting at the end of time.  This same thing has seemed to play out before and gone in HWR favor but will it again?  We have to wait till Secret Wars.
You're literally the best channel to give us a complete, factual breakdown. Thanks for the content!
I would love to see thor finding loki again at the end of this saga, seeing him burdened with the responsibility of pumping life to the multiverse
Fkn MASTERPIECE 10/10
Loki went from annoying little brother to the greatest defender of mankind
How has the MCU's original favorite villain become MCU's savior?  This show is perfect!
loki can move! he can just create a copy of him and send it over to whereever
10/10
so loki is really become a definition of a God in marvel universe. he sees all the universe, watching all, keep in good timeline in the throne.
Its so satisfying, heartbreaking, fitting, yet.... I don't know how to feel
10/10
every marvel film with time theme must need huge sacrifice. i hope avanger kang dibasty will invade tva
My theory is that Loki will take the place of Molecule Man in Secret Wars.   How he gets the power of the beyonders is still in question.  Unless they retcon the story to fit the character and story availability
Would love to win the ps5. But all things aside, loki series was phenomenal.
So what happened to victor timely ?????
So no season 3
Finally loki found his glorious purpose, Loki the god of stories 😍😍
God of stories <3
Tom is a great actor! Awesome episode!
Love people explaining what marvel can't make sense of...
WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT THAT BEAUTIFUL SUIT
If they (Marvel / Disney) don't have a scene showing Thor what Loki became, I'll be pissed! Hell, all the characters who were important to the MCU should know the sacrifice Loki made at the end. And Sylvie could be the one to tell them, or show them rather by Enchantment.
So, what lies beyond the multiverse?
I have one question though: What happened to Victor Timely?
incredible end to the series
I believe there is a being out there that provides us all with experience  we need to find happiness for ourselves, nope its not God, but its a God, a God of servitude and free will, helping you and me a God to experience life mortal or eternal to find our own sense of happiness.  And us living here in a hell of a world, a making of our own through our choices proving we are not ready for the kind of Power this Guy has, thus our damnation throughout eternity knowing that our powers will be limited and prosper like that guy has. But only IF, IF we learn to love serving others then can we become candidates to be trusted with the powers of a servant . Loki in this story seemed to learned that serving others is his happiness. The world we live in is hell because none of us worthy of the power to govern.
The names are interesting... Moebius, the eternal paradoxical loop, Ourobouros, the eternal cycle of birth and death portrayed by the Serpent who bites its tail and Sylvie. From the Latin, Sylvie originated from Silva La Forêt, the Forest.... Loki transcendantal transformation in Yggdrasil is a masterpiece, in that it ties in Sylvie to Loki. I am saddened that we do not see Sylvie in the "after". I will hate if this new Loki ends up desperately alone....
Loki is now the 🐐
I had to rush home from work to watch Loki, then rush to the theatre to watch the Marvels....just in case... there was no need.
Lokii❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤/100
Look I watch it twice the tree of life..... understand that we'll he who remains wrong
Loki became the god of stories
It is/was a proper redemption ark for "our" Loki. I would really love to see him back in the mainline MCU.
This was amazing. I wonder how far are they willing to expand Loki’s mythos
How does the watcher and celestials come into this? Do they operate in the multiverse and being watched over by loki or do they operate in their own time? This is confusing lol
1/10
I think that Marvel created a Masterpiece by mistake. I do not think even they know what they have created, holy s...
😆 🤣 😂  Marvel ruins another show
Man that was rhe best, i was definitely mind blown!!!
Really? It was ok . It was super obvious that they had something else filmed and re shot this so they can get rid of kang
Cool way to Explain MCU. Love from Pakistan
Loving the ending, now we know MCU is exist because of Loki.
The God of Stories
❤❤❤👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍 10/10
Amazing
nice way to show he who remains the middle finger lmao
Awesome
Glad I didn't have to watch this tripe to see the end. Mcu is so bad now
God the brightness of the green with his eyes, the visuals, the story. It was so good
Loki Season 2 is the best finale in any MCU show
LOKDRASIL ! just sad that the Thor and Loki reunion might take until SW 😢 Anyway, I’m still blasted by this episodes ending, Loki wanting a throne, to then change mind and understand he doesn’t want to be alone, to then take the burden and leave what he loves to do what was kinda his identity all the time !
This was better than nearly all the movies was more mature 🤌
Loki, God of Time????
I love how kang was never worried because that whole time he knew he’d never lose that was tuff
A circle... Wow
Loki will always be my favorite marvel show + the music is 🔥
My only problem I see with the whole thing is, he who remains. He essentially gives, or at least sets up loki to receive his the power to time slip. Even sets the plan in place with with Renslayer to get timely. All this is done so loki can come to the realization that he needs he who remains and that he should kill sylvie to save him. But here’s the thing, he doesn’t need loki to do this. We see that he has complete control of time with his tempad. Meaning there’s nothing sylvie can do to him if he doesn’t want it to happen. So he coulda just stopped both of them as soon as they got there to kill him originally. Instead he does all this and loki doesn’t choose any of the options he lays before him. This only makes sense if he in fact wanted loki to take over the throne so he no longer has to sit there. But that would mean he’d have to fight in the war again. So it kinda makes no sense
Loki was awesome! First time channel viewer, and an XBoX???
10 out of 10!
The score was perfect 20/10 show need a standalone loki movie theres tons of thor movies
ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!! ...that finale...I thoroughly enjoyed it and truly appreciated the ending, He's truly found his Glorious Purpose✨️ 🌳✨️💚💛
loki will save iron man
Loki rlly showed why marvel are goated - does this mean Loki is the strongest character in the mcu now?
Wow very detailed explanation it was awesome… gd job
One question...how he will eat and shit
Thanks, great vid, explains a lot, one thing I can't get it out of my mind, Asgardians can live for a long time, yes, but Loki isn't immortal, what if he dies?
The moment of the threshold from the first season was after he and Loki had that conversation and he had no idea what Loki was going to do
People are branding Loki as the God of the Multiverse now. But Sylvie says she killed Kang because he denies people free will. In a way, Loki (and variants) are God's of freewill, or mischief, trickery and change. So our Loki is still the God of Mischief, but has reached his glorious purpose. Or sure, he's the God of the multiverse now idc
Loki series…Masterpiece! 🤌🏻
“I can do this all day”-cap   I’ll do you one better…. “I can do this forever” - loki
My jaw dropped when Timely was Lo meined but at the end of this season, I was left smiling. I felt whole. Wonderful job. They put a nice bow on that.
I love how this was lowkey foreshadowed since Loki first came to the MCU “burdened with glorious purpose”
So is that it now? No more Kang?
Does that mean the color of the time stone stared from him?
Loki's ultimate act of heroism in saving the timelines and the multiverse by assuming the role of Yggdrasil. Is by far the ultimate character growth that I have seen in some time.  By doing so, he granted every world the gift of free will.   And his selfless act resonated deeply with all of us because it fulfilled our innate desire for autonomy and choice.   It became his glorious purpose, the culmination of his character development throughout his time in the MCU. Well done Marvel!! 💚
Thank you for this video. This last episode just left me with more questions.
Loki carrying the mcu rn
They better bring Loki back to fight other Kangs in the new phase and reunite with his brother Thorrrr
Great episode!
Absolutely my favorite character now.
Loki is also the guardian of the multi-verse. Now when Kang and his variants attack, Loki will summon heroes from every time line.
9.5/10
After the arrogance that Loki had continually showed all the way up to adulthood, i still find it surprising that he is so willing to accept a regular old human being more of a god than him
loki is literally carrying mcu lol
When do you think Loki took the throne. Was it before the events of the MCU…and maybe after…
Great breakdown thx
Marvel is ONLY STEP ONE, in goin back to the glory days. Yeah we GOTG 3 but wasn't enough!
Loki ep 6 really took me away FR FR 🔥🔥
I think loki is going to duplicate his self to actually visit people after he's adjusted to the power hes putting out. If he's capable of bein god of the multiverse i dont see cloning his self is some way as to tall of a task
I've been a Marvel fan since 1994.
Was really hoping to see a Beyonder Cameo here lol
Will Sylvie take Loki's place going forward?
This series is what marvel should be.
Loki finally found his "glorious  purpose"
Loki will most likely be back..... no doubt he will get the Dr Strange/Ant Man role in Avengers, in that he is the key to go from one movie to the other (and this is probably where we will get the big Loki and Thor reunion), which will probably integrate the Avengers Prime comics from Loki Agent of Assgard into it
I would’ve killed Sylvia real quick
I enjoyed this show and it was a nice return to form. Have a great day and thank you for the post show breakdowns.
One of 10 this episode was 100
But why is he alone?😢😢 I just can't digest that fact that he's gonna be alone for all eternity. I hope that he returns in Kang Dynasty or at least Loki Season 3 (if they make one). Please just don't let him be alone. 😭😭😭
All hands down! 100 out of 10 :)
Loki is managing one universe the sacred timeline not multiverse . Right? 616 was isolated but it isn't anymore so the other universes can interfere with the 616 now, how would loki manage infinite universes I don't think he can hold more than one , I'm confused ,I mean variants are created by choices if someone becomes a variant he doesn't create another universe it is just a branch . There must be variants in other universes too .
The whole Loki series is just a 10/10
So the legend of Ygrassil in Asgard is really Loki holding and giving life to the multiverse... all seeing, omnipotent, but just an observant God.
i would like a xbox
This show was so great that you forget you're watching something from the mcu. I mean everything from the cast to the acting, the sets, the music....simply amazing. Bravo to the entire production from top to bottom, it couldn't be done without everyone involved. I literally shed a tear in those final moments not only because of the outcome but also because I knew the show was coming to an end. 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
太他妈的好看了❤年度最佳
This show is 10/10 for sure !!!
The character development was a masterpiece
New here, I loved the finale
The Watcher brought to life. WFT!
7:35 made no sense to me. Die fighting what?? Sylive pissed me off this whole series, she did not care that killing he who remains would destroy everything. Also how did Loki take centuries when the loom should’ve blew up
Love the finale of Loki Season 2.  Bravo!
I really want a ps🥳🥳🥳
10 out of 10. Absolutely incredible
That was an amazing finale... I love how Loki has had a power upgrade, learning to control time. He will be integral to the new Avengers movie and dealing with the Kang variants. He stepped up and became a TimeLord (Cue Doctor Who references haha) I cant wait to see what is next.
He’s giving the multiverse a chance,  the war has started.  The endless Kangs are now truly free and the loop HWR talks about has begun.  The question is now will HWR end up right back where he was anyways like he said after the multiversal war and the destruction of everything
Loved it!
10/10
Loki made the ultimate sacrifice...👏🏾💯🥹
So do we just forget about the girl who was in the void that was looking at the monster who kills anyone that travels there??
The best series Marvel has done !!!!!
All I can say is what a show!!! I was tired of Loki before this show amazing!!!
Just subbed!!!  I’ll take the PS5 if I win thank you ☺️
Thanks for explaining it to my fried brain. Actually makes sense now, subbed. Gonna go take a look at your other breakdowns
Odin must be proud! He was right when he said you are both kings!
Best Marvel TV Show in my opinion!
Love your videos ❤
This season was dull
Dude I spent 3 hours on YouTube watching videos about Loki the God of stories. I love where the MCU is going. I still hope Jonathan Major remains as Kang and if not make Renslayer the big bad as Terminatrix.
Also, when Loki walks through the gateway is "aging"  due to the temporal radiation, and he's also gaining wisdom,  that's why his horns grew that big. AWESOME finale, best Disney+ series ever!!!
Loki has finally achieved the “god level” he deserves ❤
Didn't like this season. So messy and nonsensical.
I do question if it is the entire multiverse though or just a lot of timelines that Loki will protect. As I understand it HWR didn't erase every other timeline, but isolated his own sacred one. The loom was made to protect the sacred timeline. Not the entire multiverse interacted with the loom, therefore the lines that didn't shouldn't be under Loki's control and just exist somewhere else.
loki became a GOD- GOD
Is Loki a prisoner?
I just finished the episode and wow
Phenomenal ending to season 2 and cannot wait for secret wars and Loki season 3. It all makes sense with Loki taking "He who remains" role but as a saviour of free will. The Tree of life, Thor will be amazed with what his brother has become! 😇
8/10
This would make him the god of stories
best
it's so nice
Loki will never be left as the GOD of the Multiverse,  This is simply another step in his progression in power to return HWR back to the top, and maybe even turn himself into Aliath eating the branches at the end of time.   It is not over, just setup for the other marvel heroes to become part of, and continue the timeline until HWR is back on top.  I think HWR was in a kind of Prison by Loki inside Aliath "loki" who was mindlessly sending other branches away from the sacred timeline and back into the omniverse.  Only Loki is the king of his new sacred time tree, and all the Kangs who branch from it will now force him to fight.
Thanks for explaining this. I feel like the show didn't do the greatest job of clarifying everything.
great development of Loki, he will not kill Sylvie he's found a betrayal he can't make and the path forward emerges, he has stopped the play x against y and breed opportunity into the chaos. He is on it, he went to school learned the hard way, failed yet and still dug in for the "right" choice(s)
LOKI IS THE KEY NOW WTF IS GOING ONNNNNNNNNNN
Yea one of my favorite shows all time if not top 5 definitely top 3
loki the best series of 2023
I'm so confused what happened with rennslayer tho shes with goliath so will she be the kang variant who controls goliath?
So there gonna continue with kang? Even with the actor controversy?
Loki is giving Jesus but in MCU
10/10 ❤❤
Ps5 and ending explained? Too good to be true. Great finale, best thing Marvel has done in a long time.
So the infenent branching problem just stopped because reasons?
Best explanation 🤌🔥🔥🔥
10/10 best Disney plus show out there the Norse mythology connection is the perfect for Loki finding his glorious purpose
Now we have Time Lord Loki.⏳ And we know why Kang, under the guies of the TVA, is so focused on pruning Loki variants, particularly ones messing with time.
I'm going to address the point no one seems to: I think we're going to see Renslayer in Kang Dynasty and/or Secret Wars. Sure, we saw her in the Void and it *appeared* that Alioth found her, but we didn't actually see her get consumed.
Is the war now basically Kang vs Loki??
His arc is now complete. He began wanting a throne to relieve everyone of life's biggest lie (freedom), and now he finally took his throne to give everyone their freedom
cool finale
Explain how mutants who powers Time? There many mutants who can.
Bro is a God of mischief, bro is a ruler of universe, bro is a physicist... etc
My gosh... I never expected Marvel to be this strong & emotional after Avengers End Game. Loki showed there's still potential in Marvel and ot can be saved
Quite a parallel metaphor with Loki saving the multiverse and the marvel cinematic universe.
Im still hoping that Yggdrasil Loki would meet Thor one day...
He is not just holding the entire Multiverse, He is holding the Whole Marvel hype
i think in avangers kang ,loki will be one of the key to defeat the kang variant
Great series The only thing that I see wrong is that they have literally shelved the character Loki because they will never be able to use him again unless they write some crazy somehow palpatine returned thing
This series has more impact to the MCU than the movies. Absolutely fantastic! 🔥🔥💥
Greatest ending ever
Loki really became a pivotal part of the MCU, I hope the team and show wins some awards-- put the glorious into glorious purpose!!
I got no words to say....its just the best series of all time❤❤❤
what happened to victor timely? if the book was never dropped by Renslayer, so the Victor with Loki and the gang in TVA disappeared? He never existed?
Awesome video.. so much clearer note…whoof
Great breakdown Warren loved the season.
nice video
Marvel was cookin with this finale
Epic. Completely epic! The greatest of the tv series by Marvel. Loki, who for decades of comics, was just a simple God of Mischief. The MCU gave him a story arc of glorious purpose. Loki is now an Prime and my favorite HERO of the MCU. I can't wait to see what they do with him in the future. 🤨 Oh yeah! His story is so not over! Marvel is genius.
MCU is back
Man… this series right here… wow. 🥹
That was wild I'm stationed over seas, and I waited all day for this episode to drop thanks for breaking it down
broo somehow i wish loki and mobius have a podcast and they tell story about tva more. Conversation between them was the one i enjoy most
So wait , does this means  Loki now creates the Watchers to assist him manage the multiverse ? This is loki being GOD , unable to interfere with decisions making of mankind
Loki's real glorious purpose was to save both marvel and MCU at the same time
I love both of the seasons!
His "Glorious Purpose "!
That's it! That's it! Marvel, this is what we asked for! I'm so happy and sad.
Loki is only good thing Marvel has produced after Endgame in my opinion. Absolutely fantastic finale like oh my god how was it that good?
Can't help but to feel a lil sad about loki tho the face he made when he looked back hit me hard like leaving home to go into the world by myself
He conquerer alternate timeline....not multiverse.
Loki the series absolutely 🥶, btw thanks for the explanation. I more understand what happened after watch your video
Amen, well see him in secret wars
10/10 it was a fun ride all the way. I actually have restored my faith in Marvel because of this show. Now I have theories about where they are going from here. In the recap, we see Richard E. Grants' Loki talking about how he created an illusion that was so realistic it fooled the mad titan himself. What if, just what if, Loki put one inside Yygdrasil while the real Loki is elsewhere.
And i was wondering why in across the spider-verse when Miguel explains the Multiverse Spider verse it was shaped as a Tree It was in my mind for a while after Loki season finale it's all connected to me now  It is Yggdrasil , *Loki* Marvel Multiversal Tree  The Marvel Multiverse Watcher and Beyonder and Observer *Loki*
loki literally carrying whole MCU right now😂😀
One end of the multiverse seemed to light up with that blue purple Kang energy by the end of that scene, I’m wondering if that’s a problem 😮
7/10. Loki is my favorite character. HOWEVER, Marvel gave him what he didn't want. Yes, it was one of the only ways to save his friends and the multiverse, but he said so many times, "I don't want a throne, it's the last thing I want." The start of season 2 had him come full circle, he didn't want a throne, he had a purpose. It kind of feels wasted now. This may not be the last time we see the TVA, but I think it's the last time we'll see Loki, and definitely the last time we'll see Mobius.
But why does the timelines die?i mean i get that the loom basically just saves sacred timeline right and also it refines time into timelines but why is the loom required to do it? I mean the existence of the loom or in case lokie to make new time lines does not make sense, time should refine or be a timeline itself right?  It's like saying there is no life without  loom or timeline which means it does not refine time but actually make it exist in first place from scratch which just does not sit right with what we saw.? I mean shouldn't there be more timelines making themselves without anyone's interference which kang did in first place, why should time return to non existent state without loom? Just doesn't seem right
Also a fantastic redemption arc for Loki and a marvelous performance by Majors as usual!
That finale gave me goosebumps!
I want this to be the last appearance of Loki I think it’s perfect this way
Loki has not only saved the multiverse but also the entire mcu by giving an excellent series. After many flops from marvel, finally we got an extraordinary series. 😊😊
nah i think even though it was a 9/10 episode it was about switching from a kang storyline to a dr doom one as jonathan majors was arrested
Really an amazing finale! I also enjoyed seeing Loki in his god form again and he looks indeed glorious (especially with the new horns, I also liked that they brought the more medieval form of Loki, closer to the Norse mythology in a way). I like also the metaphor of him keeping all together, because all those branches and universes are essentially chaos, a chaotic net of life. Who would better keep it all together than the god of mischief - to enable those mischievous universes to start mingling with one another. That would be fun!
loki s1 was not loki s1 it was Sylvie s1. I'm glad the studio listened to the criticism and made a good S2.
Bro became eren yeager
omg flat earth symbol 😂
Odin would be so proud of him
I just want a ps5
9 .....  I gotta watch it a few more times
Great video thank you
It was a great episode and a great series, i just hope we will see loki again in the mcu and its not a way to kill a character without killing him
With enthusiasm they created loki series i hope they create other marvel project like loki with such perfection 🎉🎉❤
Best explanation I've seen on this episode. Thank you
Dawg you repeated the two options like four times
Loki became he who remains that’s crazy
Odins one child got depressed and fay the other become the time god
Loki easily had the greatest character development in the mcu …THIS WAS AWESOME
Loki season 1 and season 2 are masterpieces truly
Loki the god of multiverse...... best mcu series till date💚💚💚
Loki is holding the entire MCU. Wow!
I'm happy as hell for Loki
I need a playstation :( I hope I win.
I think that Loki still allowed for the multiversal war to occur anyways. Kang from Quantummania never died but the TVA completely wrote him off because he’s trapped in a realm outside of time and space. Perfect set up for the Beyonder because this Kang is “beyond” Loki’s reach!
"Loki's real glorious purpose was to save Marvel & MCU both as a story & company" -Victory timely
10/10 series, damn
How is Loki powerful enough to power the multiverse with his life force 🤦🏾‍♂️
what a great ending for a awesome series🔥👍
CRINGE!!!
Season 2 even surpassed the season 1 of loki ❤❤ brilliant
It was just amazing, I was laughing with happiness. Loved it.
You people are sad
Imagine if Thor and the entire avengers get know what the 2012 Loki has truly become, their jaws will defiantly drop.
It's like whàt happened on what if that Dr strange episode it's even better
Imma let chu know rn chief, that there’s a more than likely chance that every movie and show after Endgame is gonna get retcon.
Loki probably will figure how to "Luke Skywalker Astral Project" through all time and space. He won't be able to physically offense people nor people attack him, but he can talk to them etc.
Actually...what Loki did was solve the Jonathan Majors problem for Marvel. Once this episode's done, there's no place for Kang in the MCU.
Loki casually carrying the MCU again
It was a 100/10
He can visit other timeline with his clone remember he still god of mischief😊
He be a real GOD😃
Was the loom giving life to the branches? What causes the branches to die?
He became the loom.  Allowing for infinite scaling.  Filtering out bad timeliness and allow good timeliness to branch.
Lokie is Ygdrasil
loved the finale
Kinda dumb tbh.
If Loki now become king and timekeeper of the multiverse sitting on the throne and the TVA hunting all Kang variants wouldn’t Loki sense the branch timeline that Immortus, Rama Tut and Scarlet Centurion created? And would it affect their creations causing them to become outrage and go after Loki? I was hoping one of them will cameo in the finale post credit scene to clear that up a bit
So in the end Loki become the literal God of the multiverse
I got chills when the Multiverse turned into a tree.
Trash 🗑️ ending, the Kang plot is useless now.
Centuries of learning just to realise he cannot change anything
The sad fact is nobody will know his sacrifice nobody will know he is the reason all heroes in different universes are alive because of him.... Not even his brother his father and his mother will know how great loki is💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔🥺🥺
i find the finale quite interesting. its probably a 8/10 for me or smt like that. the one thing that boughters me is that i didnt quite get what loki did to the timelines at the end when he replaced "he who remains" with himself and in some way became "he who remains" FOR NOW, as kang comes back 100%. everything else was pretty much perfect for me, but what he did with his magic to the timelines and all this is still a big ? for me. hopefully this video clarifies that for me <3  edit: ahhhh he is giving life to them... thats why they show them as a tree for the meaning -> tree of life and loki is in the middle of it. color green which is life yeah makes sence, but how are lokis powers related to life? they are more related to trickery and stuff sooo how does it make sence for his magic to "give life energy" to those timebranches??? thanks if you could explain <3 maybe i just think those "time control" powers should have been explained more than "he just was like centuries in different timelines and learned it on the way"... idk for something like "time controll" and stuff like that i would like a better explantion but maybe that comes in some other movie idk.
Glorious purpose 💯
I really hope we will see a season 3!!!
He can create doubles of himself to go to any time an universe he wants
Okay cool. I love it. But where did he get said powers to control time
12:32 You said "HE WHO REMAINS" is now dead. How? he is not dead right? Why who would he be dead? who killed him?
He can see everything and everyone,  but can't interact with them. What a burden but its glorious purpose.
whole video bs about things we already know
Did Oden know? He told Loki in dark world that his birthright was to die. Oden  was always harder on Thor than loki. The one who was supposed to be king left the throne (Thor) and the one who always wanted the throne got a throne he doesn't necessarily wants but takes the responsibility (loki)
well if he realises his decision was wrong or if he's bored sitting like this, he can time slip back to start of episode 6 and try something else
I was thinking Loki is so OP right now that he can control time, got the og magical powers,   dude  is probably smarter than Tony and bruce now, everything till i saw the last scene  where he's literally the life of the multiverse 😮 marvel truly raised their bars again with this one👌❤️
Frigga must be proud, my son God of Time
Can somebody enlighten me? Where did victor timely go after? Thanks
Did you catch the reference of the 616 kang and that he was “taken care of”? Is that confirmation that he’s dead??
What a crap finale. What was the point of making the best character in the series do nothing but give Loki an idea dea in the finale.
watch me win my first giveaway ever! yessirr!.
Why the branches are dying? Is it already explained or will be explained later by Marvel? PLease tell us. Why loki has to give timelines life. What kind of life energy is it? I mean I am confused. Does this involves any celestial?
It was a good episode live the same moments for a century blow my mind.
Can’t wait
What do you think about when he said that variant 616 was just in some fight but everything is fine. Could there be a reference to the Jonathan Majors situation?
Loki got the best throne in the whole universe at a cost😭💔
The finale was beautiful. 10/10 x 100000000
Man, I feel like Mobius… empty and lost! This was perfect
this means that loki hae already seen avengers secret war and he can spoiler everything  hooo shit p.s. how the giweaeay for the play 5 and xbox works?
Avenger Prime baby!
I wanna win
Said from day 1 , loom needed to be destroyed for it to be free again . And getting a shit load of heroes to keep Kang on each earth and timeline
Loki's sacrifice for multiverse is bigger than Tony Stark...🙌
He who remains is a trickster and conman just like Loki and he may be better at it than Loki is. He has been doing it way longer than loki. Loki basically had 1other option other than what was proposed by he who remains and he had to know this so he had to have had some kinda escape plan that didn't include dying. He knew enough to stop Loki's sword right in front of his face. I highly doubt he is truly gone
So you need centuries to understand physics.
So what happened to VT & HWR at the end?
Is that why the time stone is green,so is it all connected
Absolutely stunned that they gave Loki his god of stories title and the new version of the tva it's amazing and this show is great 10/10
Keep in mind...this is not the original Loki. None of this would have been possible if the Avengers never went back in time so this one could escape.!
Loki has come from being selfish and deceiftful and now presented himself as nothing but a selfless God, protecting the universe. Amazing narrative! Wonderful series, all cast members and story, script is world class.
In my opinion, it was the perfect ending for the series. Absolutely perfect! What I loved most of all was how Loki changed, and realized what it means to be a god….Absolutely amazing! A 10 out of 10 for me!
Loki's glorious purpose was to save mcu both as story and company
Paganism
What a recovery for the MCU. Loki Loki Loki!
I kinda hope to see more Tom Hiddleston act again, maybe reunited with thor but then again, he can't just leave. It sucks that he'll stuck there all alone forever.😢
So basically he became the time stone himself that explains why time stone is gree
The moment Mobius said “you just need to choose your burden” makes Loki realised he rather take all the responsibilities/owner of the sacred timelime or to kill silvie. He love Silvie so much 💔
He’s now the god of stories
I find strange that some overpowered character have the same color of the infinity stone loki is green like the infinity stone of time, wanda is red like the stone of reality...if we see soon character with the color we'll know
The best show with the best plot from the MCU till date. Tom Hiddleston nailed the role of The god of mischief.
Amazing episode. I was disappointed with the season, but after this, looking back...I'm impressed.
Ps5😗
Tony unknowingly made loki escape using tesseract by not allowing hulk into elevator simultaneously Tony made loki God of multiverse making time travel possible even without mobious strip.
Amazingggg episode! Best disney plus MCU episode!
I'm already subscribed. I feel like Loki is worthy now. A benevolent God.
So now Loki is more powerful Than scarlet witch??
Thanks making this so fast! I thinking What The Hell? Loki made a Tree out of time streams?.
Omg I really enjoyed this series so well done
I thought the season was going a bit slow the first few episodes but that finale was 👌🏻
Great Review Man! Just finished watching the Finale. It was awesome.
What happened to Victor timely at the end?
So is Loki now The watcher?
Renslayer gets to hang with Alioth
IM PROUD OF YOU LOKI YOU BOSS UP
nice
What makes Loki tic and Loki really tics
10/10
Loki finally got a throne 😂😂🙌🙌🙌❤
This season finale proved exactly what Loki is capable of. He grabbed every branch of the timeline and tied it all together into one giant Multiverse Tree that represents Yggdrasil, the world tree. Loki may have bought the everyone in the Multiverse time to prepare for the fight against the council of Kangs because this Multiversal War will change everything in the Multiverse Saga.  The only question is, who was the variant that saved Ravonna Renslayer? Immortus, Ramatut, Silver Centurion, or Kang?
He finally got his well deserved throne
All of this was a ruse for He who remains to escape from being pretty much the God of time. So he chose Loki as his replacement but he had to condition and mold Loki into understanding what that role meant. Gonna make for interesting times for MCU to say the least. Lets hope they don't drop the ball with this clean slate.
Loki is literally carrying the entire marvel universe lol😂😂❤
Loki straight up ended up as the chad.
He is beyond all now or not ?    🥺
Best Marvel show ever
This episode was golden it was well written, I was smiling the whole time when Loki was going into the gun way to destroy the loom
Pay these writers man, THEY NEED A RAISE!
I am going to miss watching loki
Loki is the new kang
A very good ending for this series
Bro I cried like how can that finale be so good!
What an amazing series❤❤❤. Sad we will never see him again😢 remember he can let go the timeline
Stark saved the entire universe..  Loki saved the entire multi-verse..
Side note, but you have a great mic. The sound is awesome and very relaxing the way it’s set up!
Please get back to making more like this. This was the best story arc of the whole mcu.
If loki is sitting there . How did he get killed by Thanos?
100/10 never expected this what an incredible character development 👏🏼
Loki is now the life of MCU & I ain't joking....
I rate this episode an ouroboros out of  10.
The real definition of Loki's "your savier is here"
EPIC!!!  ABSOLUTELY EPIC!!!
Actually, doesn't that actually make Loki the same as Nidhoggr? In that case, isn't he the real Ouroboros? The dragon that eats its own tail?
This was amazing I have no words just brilliant writing and performance
I’m hell pissed on this I want the kang dynasty secret wars etc why set up Monica Rambo in xmen universe at end of marvels
Is this really true? Has Disney really nailed it instead of ruin it? Haven't expected that and might be worth it for me to reactivate my Disney+ Account ... at least for one month. Great video, thanks.
So I guess no kang dynasty
Duds i knew as soon as I saw it! Looking became the heart of Yidrassil
The Loki series is the best written series all the way around 😩
10/10, amazing series - best MCU has done.
Amazing 🤩 Finale and Excellent Series  One of the best Marvel has done ✅ 10/10
Wow what an ending.
I want that Xbox series X or the ps5
Best.. Character.. Arc… EVER
Loki is op
This was a horrible ending no explanation Loki got more plot armor than Bruce Wayne...terrible writing.....oh they did it to write off Johnathon Majors it makes sense now
You know it baffles my mind over the years Iv seen Loki go from a hated villain to an avenger and now the guardian of time I hope this isn't the last we see of him but if this is indeed the end Loki has joined the ranks of the greatest heroes ever and I'm glad to see in the end he did bring peace just like Oden said he would
Loki  has come full circle.. from thor 1 wanting to be a king on his throne and avengers making everyone kneel telling them how humans truly just want to be subgigated without freewill to a king on a throne as the ruler and protector of free will accross all the multiverse.
MAN this was a amazing finale .Finally some good project from marvel studios😮😯😲
Broo, Marvel's back on track.
That was so good! Mouth open for most of the episode😮
Nice !
Loki the best character and my favourite an absolute amazing masterpiece and character development 😢😢🫶🫶
Loki needs a chiro appointment for literally carrying and holding together the MCU what an amazing finale bro is now a Fvckin time god. 🔥
Loki went from holding people hostage to holding down the multiverse. Epic character trajectory
Loki is the mcu. Best character development hands down. Great series
I think it's been missed in the reviews the difference between how Kang stopped time versus how Loki stopped time in that one scene.   Kang needed to manipulate his technological device to stop time whereas Loki just used a flick of his finger.   At the end of the day, Kang was still just a man who knew how to control time through science and technology, but Loki now had that same knowledge of time, science and technology, but combined with his powers of a god, including enchantment, which allowed Loki to find a third option that Kang could not since he was just a man.
I can see this playing out from here, Loki’s TVA will be the ones to start looking for the multiversal Avengers, to help defeat all the Kang variants
a really great finish to the season. I really hope this is leading to a showdown between Loki as the God of Stories and the council of Kangs we saw at the end of Ant Man 3. Phase 4 has been pretty mediocre, that we can all agree. Too many things going on etc etc. But if they can bring it all together for an epic finish, then none of those misfires will really matter
This episode was so good
Wow nice
Dope show
Thats perhaps why the time stone is green
Loki = MCU version of Molecule man
This season 2 just showed everyone that MCU still has life in it. Let's hope they raise their standard and continue releasing good stuff like Loki Season 2. I may even go see The Marvels after this finale.
Wait so, what's the point of the counsel of kings if all of the timeliness would delete themselves anyway?
this show has probably been one of the best marvel projects ever, it is on part with endgame and infinity war.
amazing
Loki had the most gripping story since Endgame. The cast and visuals were also great. I really enjoyed this show and hope we explore more of Loki's fate and the TVA in the future.
Will loki season 3 come ????💙
I just watched the finale.... And ,it could not have been better !!! The MCU is back baby !!!!!
the suit at the end is just chef's kiss 🔥
10/10🔥
best series ever give me that ps5
Who's gonna hold all of the timelines if Loki needs to eat and pee?
Jonathan Majors does such a good job with this version of He who remains. It’s really a masterclass of acting imo.
It was the best the m she u produced in years the loki series is great i don care what anybody else says lokis cac development and everything is amazing
Bravo 👏 Excellent ending.
Loki really was burdened with GLORIOUS purpose, 10/10 best thing marvel has produced both story and character
damn , the Loki series was so great !!
He who remains preplan Loki faith regardless 😂
I never fully understood what *omnipresence* means until this episode of this show - to be in the past, present and future, in any point in time, in every timeline that exists, but not be a part of them at the same time.  If there truly exists an omnipresent God, he must be so lonely.
Means loki will sit there for ever.....
This is so dope
i'll take an xbox pls good vid
Loki always been the goat 🔥
Loki becomes the god we knew he should be.
Loki literally carrying the multiverse a.k.a. the mcu itself
Although Ouroboros is a concept. I think the creators are trying to bring Jormungandr into it. A snake/reptilitian creature the Loki created... or helped and the it grew to a size to devour. Thor is supposed to fight Jormungandr, not sure if that will happen in the MCU, but still. Both snake ideas are closely connected.
One of the best series of mcu out right now, thats for sure. Its way more entertaining and enjoyable and loki is one of my favorite characters so im glad his show is great.
Loki had a lot character development in this season for sure. Before he doesnt care to kill but now the dude really have "Burden with Glorious Purpose"..Well written!!!
Loki saved mcu, but feel bad because he doesn't look happy he served his glorious purpose but again he is alone
Sexy
The God of Stories, Loki the Son of Odin ❤
Anybody else see Loki looking like dr doom just me😳👀
The timelines looking like Yggdrasil was absolutely perfect! Every episode was a banger, 1000/10 show
Not quite a happy ending
im poor plz help me
I will miss this series, Still gives me chills. Best Marvel Series by far!
He is now a God finally.
Loki is the best series in the MCU. period.
Wrong, Kang is done,they pruned jonathan  majors out. It’s Doom now baby.
Loki became Yggdrasil. Period
The season was Meh. You don't care about anyone as they are constantly dying and coming back to life. 😂
This episode is rated infinitive/0
I cried when he sat on that throne
He became "The Watcher"
*Entire multiverse starts to break apart trillions dying and turning to spaghetti but then suddenly stops and goes back to normal*  Loki: Sorry needed to scratch my balls.
iron man save universe, loki save the entire multiverse.
IT"S A BEAUTIFUL ENDING.
Of course the white man has to safe the day for the 40yr olds man-childs to be a great show
When the branches became the tree of Life big time Norse mythology, Bravo 👏🎉🎉🎉🎉
im rating this series as a  20/10
I felt as though they were hinting toward Mobius' son being the variant that he failed to prune when he was a hunter. He said that the boy and his brother were diving into the ocean by a dock and he couldn't prune the one he was supposed to and froze. He has two sons. One of them was hinted to have anti-social behaviour, having set fire to his toys and burned them black. And he has this awful PTSD about going to see his old life and didn't wanna talk about it.  Seems to me like Mobius has a very interesting and dark backstory.
Cool
This episode was epic
Dude I was going crazy after I saw Yggdrasil
Loki has two of the best character arcs in the MCU 💀
Mind-blowing, Loki was always the villain that you just can't hate and now he became the D GOD
Loving every minute of this show!
10\10
This has been the best thing to come out of the MCU for me and I've seen everything so far.
I think he becomes the watcher of MCU
Loki be like Doctor Strange "Sylvie, I have a bargain"
He became the watcher!😢
Amazing finale!
loki
im lost for words. this video is perefect. i hope i win the giveaway
fire vid 🔥
amazing ending! God of time?
Mid
I just watched the finale, and the only thing I can say is that this is the greatest MCU series movie ever hats off for the remarkable and tremendous job you did. Loki is peak marvel. If you told me at the beginning of Avengers that Loki is the one who's going to save the timeline and care for others before him, I wouldn't believe it, but wow, this shows the amazing characters development. Thank you, Marvel, for this masterpiece.
The God who saved the multiverse
It will go down as one of the best cb series of all time, no doubt. Incredible finale🔥
The finale was amazing!! ❤
Do you think the Ten Rings of Shang chi is sending signal to Loki or maybe refers to a center point in time?? Referring to post credit scene in Shang Chi Just thought there might be a connection here?!
Asgard and beyond
So is Loki stuck there forever ? He can’t move ? He’s just stuck ?
It's morbin time ✖️ It's Loking time ☑️☑️☑️🔥🔥🔥
This ex exceeded expectations all the way
Ngl. I have never seen a scene so epic in a series.
The god of existence
That final scene, with Loki holding all time lines, and that look on his face, personified character development.  The writing of this series alone is why I fell in love with Marvel.  Awesome series and proof that Loki is literally the heart of the MCU right now...LITERALLY!!
Awesome video(: I had to go on YouTube to find something to help me understand the ending lol. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
So literally, Marvel is in Loki's hands. And I rate it 10/10 💝
Essentially he became God
No word 10/10 hope i win too 🎉
lol so if the captain marvel movie is shit it's lokis fault
He better be in the kang dynasty
6/10 season
He truly was destined to be king
Writer of rick and morty wrote this series right?
I’m very happy they made Loki all powerful
Is renslayer meet En Sabah Nur or she is his mother?
I wonder what this now means for Loki and what his role in the new movies/shows will be as he is no longer able to leave his position. Can’t wait to see what happens next!
These ads are getting worse
Loki is gonna be sitting there for a long time. I hope his chair reclines or he has massage chair or something. Wont he get bored sitting there?
So basically there are two sacred timelines. One is Kang's the other is Loki's which was a failsafe?
Crazy to think that Loki has now become one of the most powerful beings in all of fiction
Tom Hiddleston cast for Thor, but i feel grateful hes playing Loki....
So basicly that Loki does is like Atlas carrying earth, heaven, and hell?
Undoubtedly THE most important marvel character
PERSONALLY, I THOUGHT IT WAS ANOTHER COP OUT WOKE OPTION....GOD OF MISCHIEF...BUT NOW A HERO? THEY COULDVE SHOWN MORE CHARACTERS...HEAVY HITTERS, VILLIANS...BUT IN THE END...IT WAS JUST SOME GREEN LINES & LIGHTS....I GET THE CONCEPT...BUT STORYLINE & CONTENT WAS LAME...MCU NEEDS TO DROP THE WOKE WEAK GIRLPOWER BULLSHIT
When he cuts open a hole to go to the citadel of time it looks like the same scene when they enchanted Alioth and discovered the citadel. I was just thinking if the whole TVA was inside Alioth all this time.
Really well explained. Such an excellently planned out series and finale!
I think this was not the first end they pland. This end can be used to write off J.Majors as Kang from the next movies. The tva hunt down every kang and the concil of kangs will not happen. Another villian take place off kang in the future, maybe dr.doom. sorry for my bad english ;)
loki series is the is the real saviour of mcu.what a fantasctic character 10/10
Loki is the reason why the Time stone is green!
The end is seen where Loki seems will be sitting there holding branches for eternity. But MCU being MCU, im sure they will figure it on how Loki will be able to create something like a substitution of himself that will have his aura energy, then have the branches hook up to that thing and then let him be able to roam freely and continue with his adventure.  Also as for Renslayer, that purple light appear before her at ancient Egypt can be Kang Rama Tut cracking thru the timeline and this will set the proper future love story between Kang & Renslayer. Could be where the starting of mutant storyline too.
This episode was gratifying but confusing
Wow simply just wow bro you are doing a excellent work for all of us by making this video and telling about loki session 2 finale ending explained and what loki did explained and keep it up and keep up the good work as always and take care  Keep smiling always
Man thor and odin and his mother will be so proud of him...wish they could see him
Insane 🤯
Wow!  This ended just like one of the ancient stories from Greek/Norse  mythology.  I really love how all of the timelines are now forming a giant version of the world tree.  This series is simply amazing!
Loki the Goat
what an episode, carrying marvel
bruh, no wonder other things from marvel sucks; their best team was working on Loki💚
Not to forget the Norse mythology that puts Loki at the centre of Ragnarok and causing the world to restart. This is that writ on a much larger scale than the nordic sages could ever have imagined.
That new suit 👌👌👌
loki god of the universe sounds so good🤩
Omfg, that was incredible. Started as a god he thought he wanted to be, to being the god he should be. He's the ultimate god, what a character arch!!!! Omg incredible
If only Thor could see his brother now.
Crazy that oden noticed this and made sure loki survived. Thor cared for him cause he saw his true colors. Loki felt hate for holding back his emotions. This is why he is a well written character. Thor got written too non existence.
This is what marvel had been missing. Less jokes, high stakes, sacrifice, consequences and not happily ever after. Good writing.
.
This might be the first reference of how world tree is created as far as I know of..and the creation is poetic, Loki truly is a selfish god, he wants everything, and he creates it. damn
legendary show! 100/10 im always mind blown
I think we won’t see loki again. Kind of ironic that the character we saw die the most ends up living forever
Secret wars on the way!!!
10/10
Wow
This was too insane I can't believe how cool this is Loki is like my fav villain now damn THAT WAS SICK!!
i feel like crying in the last scene
Am I the only one who is not completely down with this being the end of the loki series. I feel like although this was a perfect end to the season and an amazing ending for lokis character development, I feel like it's unfitting for he who remains to simply allow this to be an option. I hope that this still sparks at least a multiversal war or in turn still somehow creates a timeline that leads to he who remains. Because I would love the end villain for phase 6 to be Kang as he who remains. If he truly paved the way for loki and existed outside of time Infinatly I doubt he would allow for a possibility that dead ends his plans. we obviously have to eventually move on from Kang but I hope there is still more that we can do with the character at least in upcoming movies. I also want to say how enjoyable it was to see victo timely, it really made you feel sympathetic for the character sort of giving us an understanding that not all kangs are like he who remains
Great season. 10/10 episode
Before the finale I was enjoying the show so much I wanted a season 3 but I love this ending so much I don’t mind if loki’s story ends here
Great Explanation.Great Ending to the  series. Keep up the Good Work.
be prepared, the real kang will be coming
I have a prediction that the final TVA guidebook was authored by Loki and OB was reminiscing in the finale
Mobius is one of the most wholesome MCU characters ever.
Loki was def 10/10
Best marvel tv show ever, Hope we see more of loki.
The best marvel content since endgame . 100/10
This explains how there are kangs,such as in quantimania out there,since their after Loki season 2
Simple. He became the god of Time
Very informative video
This was the best finale ever
Loki is the heart of Yggdrasil Very surprised
Character development of loki from thor 1 to this. It's beautiful
Your microphone is still extremely soft.
SAVIOUR OF MCU
I love how Loki has evolved as a character.
😮 I had no idea what happened? This is awesome! What is next for loki? Has Marvel gone too far? Will it all be reset?
10/10 im still left speechless
This is the best fiction ever created! The feeling I felt watching this series is something I have never felt before, It unlocked a whole new feeling in me and I can now see  the ultimate purpose in a whole new way that I never thought was possible before. Thank you Marvel.
That may be the most beautiful thing I've ever seen....................................................................
Thx for the explanation, I enjoyed this show
I watched the scene with Loki and HWR 4 times to make sure I didn't miss anything. It was an awesome episode. I can't wait to see where it goes from here.
Well damn. I think they saved it
Loki got his Throne!!!
He went omega loki and I have never seen anything more beautiful.
This series is a blast now that season 2 is out, now i rank this above TFATWS as my fav tv show, but the MCU is still dying lol, the century part was kinda rushed on the finale of the season, and also with the marvels, it's a literal bomb, this year has some bangers but mostly some downward spirals, including quantumania, the marvels and secret invasion, loki season 2 and GOTG Vol. 3 were bangers tho
Glorious Purpose indeed.
Rating: Infinity/10
He got his throne.
the entire loky series was a filler, no relevance to the mcu, pointless show led to nothing
This last episode is what the whole season should’ve been. So basically Loki did all this sacrifice and secret wars is still going to happen
I need an explanation to why the branches are dying after Loki destroys the Loom. And how is Loki powerful enough to power the entire multi-verse.
Best thing so far
1/10
yo this is the best thing since infinity war,just in awe
I'm happy the way it ends a s3 might ruin this perfect ending  I really hope they dont milk this but make new marvel content like this not the current the marvels bullshitt  We will see loki again GLORIOUS PURPOSE!   IM A LOKI FAN NOW!
What happened to ranslayer does she kang variant
For me, it tops Avengers Infinity War and Endgame. So well written show. Very fresh from MCU.
Kind of sad ending in a way,  that Loki will be alone for all eternity.  I never thought I feel bad for Loki but I do for this version anyway I do. Though as I was watching the end of  it kind of made sense that he'd be the one to go, because he could never go back to his timeline or 616, because there would 2 Loki's then,  in the same universe, timeline whatever. But I like that branches became the Tree of Life, and I instantly knew it  what it was, before it even fully formed what it was , because I designed my my mom's Grave Stone with symbol with the Tree of Life, since the Tree of Life is also   part Irish Folklore too. I first learned about the Tree of Life actually from Dragon Ball 1st before  then Norths Mythology and Thor comics and then later it was also in Irish Mythology too.  For me I give this a 10 out 10 and the series over all 10 out 10.
This is a proper way to introduce the kang dynasty
Loki season 2 was Endgame level! Amazing.
♾️/10
The evolution of Loki from the first Avengers movie where he held people hostage to this finale is the biggest magic Loki has done! Heartwarming, inspiring and EPIC!!!
And you know what's genius about the finale? In Season 1, it was established that Sylvie cannot enchant Loki. When Sylvie enchants someone, she can read their memories. But since Sylvie cannot enchant Loki, he cannot just have Sylvie read his mind for her to know that he's telling the truth.
The question no one is asking is what game He Who Remains is playing ...  It appears he could easily kill Loki and Sylvie ... But he doesn't.  Is he just bored? ... Or is there something he wants ... Or does he just do this from time to time to see what happens - in which case he wouldn't commit suicide, because he would want to see the outcome.
loki is  the best season marvel made so far
How does he have the energy to do this forever?
Boy! I don't think there's someone better than Jonathan Majors to play his role. Just marvelous performance
GLORIOUS PURPOSE!!
I would have just killed Sylvie
I already saw this episode... no need to waste time telling us what happened line for line. Just explain it in other words to help ppl understand.
I don't understand the ending, i have question so loki is "he who remains"?
This episode was everything I expected and better 10/10
I need a PS5.. I’m broke brother😅
Or…here me out. Loki could have just told Silvi that he was from the future or taken Sylvi to meet her past self. However, we will just have to go with it.
LOKI FOR ALL OF US
He who temporal loom
I still dont get many things about what happened in this series and couple of loop holes too. But I hope the future projects make it more clear. Like I thought he who remains had a special tempad to control time and doors but now he doesn't need them?? Or he never needed them.
Villian to owner of the time line❤
yeah marvel is hit and miss rn but it’s definitely not suffering like some ppl think. hopefully the marvels is the last of the stinkers for a while 🙏🤞
I think the way we will see Loki again as a driving force in secret wars where he might be able to get in on the action in battle world for a bit and then just be back with Thor and his friends in the TVA since my guess for the end of this saga is that the multiverse will sorta collapse
Best channel to get a review
My thoughts at the end were, how’s Loki going to eat, use the bathroom, and pass the time if all he does is sit on the throne and observe. That has to get boring real quick. I imagine it would very quickly feel like a prison.
Which Kang was in 616?
From conquering ney york to becoming god of the multiverse.  Best series my god
So is Loki HIM now?
But what does all this mean for the Excursions? Are they still happening,  being caused by Kang variants? What the multiversal war still happen or did Loki prevent it? What causes Secret Wars then if Loki is now holding everything together? 🤔
10/10 series, a big W, finale last scene where he becomes the "he who remains"or "life of multiverse"  it felt so different, and the music was also a different wibe. The whole series was just a big W
Great series! Great finale! 10/10. No longer the multiverse. It is now the Lokiverse.
WOW!! Pure poetry 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
imma cry good ending
10
Look bro,. we just saw how Loki works with Kang. He believes in Kang. Similar to how red skull ended up looking after the stone. we dont know the story that made it the skullz purpose, here they showing us why Loki and Kang are together and how it got there.
I watched the first episode and I said I'm not going to watch anything else until the last one comes out 😂😂😂 it is now 3:41 a.m. and I have watched all the episodes straight....   I stood up in my living room and gave a standing ovation 😂😂😂   This was amazing20/10
I'm hoping a s3 will be Loki creating the new avengers team and bringing Tony, Tasha back together with Thor, hulk etc.
10 I loved it. Marvels best show.
One of the best series i've ever seen.
Loki become WATCHER
But does that mean that Loki is always going to be …. Alone …. That was once said to Loki???
Thor and Loki are technically reuinited if you think about it. Loki now holds the Multiverse together and like the video said became Yggdrasil, and Thors is now raising the personification of Eternity in Love. And its kinda what Loki always wanted... to be loved. Beautiful series!
Theory I have, the thing we see being summoned at the end of Chung chi is Loki chilling out to the timelines for help against kang and what we’ve been seeing this whole time is different realities of variants we just haven’t been told that yet
10.5 out of 10
just wow.
What a great Finale!!!
Amazing show and season, I would put this season right behind wandavision
Loki became the god of ALL time.. kinda kills any future Marvel movies. Also, Loki spent centuries learning only what OB knew, but didn't learn anything else, and just ended up with the same end. Kinda could have had a better ending. Feels like this ends the series. Which is OK. Reboot the whole MCU and make better movies moving forward.
Loki series was 99,1% masterpiece.
Anyone else really upset about the way he says Yggdrasil🙃
What a glow up. Loki wins all the glow ups. Btw Sylvie is so frustrating to watch.
this finale was so satisfying
I am commenting for the givaway
Tens layer is still out there. They showed it. She is going to be a problem down the road.
The series was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. i was kinda confused with the ending though, BUT your video helped a lot so thanks for that XD , you got yourself a new subscriber :D
Absolutely loved it! Loki's personal journey of maturity has lead to him become who he always wanted to be.
What an absolute blinder of a show and a standard for the multiverse saga going forward, marvel should hold thier ground with everything good or bad after this,  there are heroes in this phase while with shows or movies of lower quality need to be given time to truly shine and be given the quality deserved.  I don’t think they need to abandon everything, rather fix what’s damaged with what they have other wise it’s a waste. Going to see the marvels on Tuesday. Hopefully the recent news of significant delays will be good for them.  Great video Warren as are all of them.
LOKI king of multiverse and create new avengers in multiverse......
Such a perfect ending to an amazing story!
I went to Marvels today and enjoyed that too. The movie has some flaws but still way better than the Quantumania mess.
So,  Odin always knew
Was worried that no one could carry the MCU forward after RDJ and Chris Evans were done. Would of never guessed Tom would. I loved the series. I honestly thought Loki was just going to kill sylvie but this shows how caring he is. Now I’m curious to see how the multiversal war starts under his reign
I love Loki's Time-slipping ability. This episode was crazy. 👌🏾
Loki is basically the watcher
The He Who Remains conversation reminds me of the Matrix
Best ending series Marvel ever made. 11/10
This was one of the best things MarvelStudios has put out in a while! I literally almost cried! So many emotions! Does that mean that they will no longer be going forward with Kang's story? He defeated him. I knew by the second to last episode that he would become He Who Remains. A ♾️ out of 10!
Amazing!
definitely a 10 Loki ascended to a new God tier
Loki, holding the Marvel studios in the balance, killing his character would put them deep in the trench 😂😊
Loki just lvled up!!!
Are we just gonna ignore this is a season finale and not a series finale 😱
I don't think that Ravona was getting attacked by Alioth. I think the purple glow was coming from a Kang variant.
He finally got his thrown
Damn, Loki S2 finale is a 100/10. Chef kiss. What an amazing episode and season. Hope Loki, the God of Stories, will be back in some way, shape or form in future MCU projects.
This was the masterpiece.. That sacrifice is bigger than tony stark.. What a character development
Loki has become a Watcher.
Cant Loki create his own clone/projection and then go to any timeline he want?? Or now Loki power get nerfed?
Man, what a well-done show. Such a fitting arc for Loki's character, to ascend to a throne of actual glorious purpose! Just a beautifully-crafted story
But just to be sure, does this ending mean that Jonathan Majors stays as Kang the Conqueror?
Love it !!!
That means that Marvel will make references to Norse mythology in the multiverse  🔥🔥🔥
Loki IS He Who Remains
You forgot Renslayer at the end showing the TVA in Ruins
legit sign me up for  the ps5 i want to get one for my father
Somehow Loki must get out there without killing the branches.
What Happened to victor timely he was there when Loki was walking down the ramp
My confusion is he who remains said by destroying the loom, a war happens and all timelines, including the sacred timeline, would die from that war. So if loki is giving the multiverse life, then did that same war still happen that nearly killed all timelines?
i didn't like it alot ... to be honest i was expecting he who remains to thrive again and again and again ... i feel like Kang as a whole dropped ... it was build very good in season 1 , season two canceled season 1 , and i was expecting a connection between the kangs and the multiversal war , i was expecting chaos at the end not peace
Good video
Wowser
So, the Kang variants that invent technology to jump to new timelines inevitably discover there is a multidimensional organization hunting them down and killing them.   Sounds like a reason to go to war.
his consciousness can go back to any time and any timeline, even though his physical body remains in the timeloom
To a hated villain to a savior. What a development man
Nice
So does Loki literally have to have all the branches in his hands at all times? His hands must be tired, and he can't sleep either right?
So that means loki becomes "one above all" because one above all is the creator of multiverse 🤔🤔??
I'm just mesmerized, Loki is the best series ever
I need a Loki origins story. Like is he really the a frost giant orphan? Did kang steal his power and though he maybe couldn’t kill him he could make him a helpless abandoned infant (who’s really lucky and good at surviving).  I also think that Loki made the infinity stones. Obviously the time stone is green but the other stones also have Loki-esq powers. Like maybe he can offload some of his power and throne-sitting responsibilities to timekeepers in individual universes so he can potter around and visit to make mischief in the worlds.  Steven strange gets to the bottom of time and “dafaq are you doing here Loki!” Vindication!  Also Loki has always been able to project his likeness. So like he could technically send an avatar of himself to every universe and then also monitor every universe from where he’s sitting  I’d love if this story could tie into mythology again - like what do Odin and Thor make of all this?
So the timestone is green because Loki controls all time
The same villain who made the avengers assemble to save a planet is now the same person that saves the entire multiverse
loki became the life giving tree
I'm confused the show was all over the place and honestly not that good
So will we see Loki again or are we to assume he is just chilling on his throne
As usual my Glorious King Loki carries, Literally 👏
Best marvel series
Bro this show was f'n goated
This is got to be the best series 👏👏👏
this also changes the theory that loki will lead the multiversal avengers it seems like it will just be the tva doing that now so mobius, b15, casey, and the repurposed ms minutes
Tell you what, my most favourite Marvel character is Loki from now on and its probably not gonna change now.
10 out of 10! The writing was perfect, the acting was amazing! Great series!
It can be explained simply... Its complete shite. M-She-U is dead.
So my confusion lies in how everyone was in their own timelines(when he had to find everyone) & they seemed to be living fine, was that not the case? Were there timelines going to "spaghetti out" like Sylvie's was? I may have missed something... 🤔
haven't watched cosmic in ages and bros nearly at a mill, lets go. Also having  Loki in the main MCU timeline would make sense imo, wouldn't take away form Thanos's power, it would feel like just one last trick.
Awesome Video Warren!!! OMG THIS FINALE WAS INSANE!!!!!! There were still some things I didn't understand, But it really Was Incredible! Tom Hiddleston and Jonathan Majors were just Phenomenal in This Episode! And Loki finally taking up His role as The God of Stories is just Perfect! This Season was absolutely Incredible!  Even better than Season 1 In My Opinion! I really hope We get a Season 3,  But if We don't I'm very Happy with This Being The Perfect end of The Series.  FOR ALL TIME ALWAYS!!!!!! WOOF WOOF!
This why the time gem green
How He Who Remains is dead now?!!!!
Amazing Episode!!! Feel sad for Loki but he just became the "God of Stories", however, looks like Renslayer actually wound up in the realm of Rama Tut(one of the original Kang variants) and it looks like either Kang or Aliath is with her, so this could actually be the beginning of the Kang Dynasty now that Loki has removed himsef from the equation.   As many people have pointed out, Loki`s name means Loop, so maye it was actually him who was keeping the Sacred Time Line and Time Loom loop repeating. I think that he was actually the only thing stopping Kang from becoming a true Conqueror and the reason why HWR always wound up in the same place. Maybe Loki`s existence and creation of the TVA was actually Kang`s REAL prison and what kept him in the citadel at the end of time (because he did not look like a conqueror there). I`m starting to think that no matter what Kang tried to do, he would always wind up as HWR instead of Kang The Conqueror because of Loki`s interference or existence.   So it`s possible that HWR actually needed Loki to REMOVE himself from existence in this universe and take up a position as the God Of Stories, keeping himself busy with all of the previous temporal loom timeline branches in order for Kang to finally break that cycle and go beyond a certain point which would allow him to truely start conquerig things and reach his true goals - Conquring the Universe/Multiverse (if it still exists). I think Loki got tricked into sealing himself at the end of this; which allows Kang (Rama Tut Kang) to start moving freely and creating the world as he wants it to be from the past.  Remember, in the comics the first time Kang meets renslayer, he actually saves her (or vice versa) from a beast using his technology. This could be the beginning of that, which is why the TVA hasn`t been able to find variants of him on the timeline yet. There`s only 1 so far, in the past, going by the name of Rama Tut and keeping a low profile as he increases his technology and following.  That`s my theory for now anyway. But GREAT Marvel Episode with awesome storytelling! Scre "The Marvels", just watch this all weekend. 🙌🤩🔥
This shit about "past road" not work 2nd time
See this LOKI.... And thor from thor 4. There's no comparison now...
Ok now it makes sense. Kang's love interest got destroyed by the cloud monster in the void right?
The God of Stories He has a purpose and not a loser
Here's my theory He who remains gave Loki two choices break the loom and let the whole multiverse war proceed or kill her and protect the sacred timeline so Loki picked his own choice which is to destroy the look give everyone free will so I think that choice Loki chose was he who remains talked about continuing the whole multiverse war because he said that his variants are already existed and when Loki gave life to the time he can view but can't control and we already know that the upcoming movie Kang dynasty which means he who remains was right there's only two choices left destroy the look create another multiverse war and here comes he who remains and creates the TVA and it's all just a loop he who remains already said he knows the beginning and the end so I would think he who remains would still win
Also can we acknowledge that loki is now the god of time and space and vitality of the multiverse and hes GREEN and the time stone is green too and like they were created obviously AFTER loki takes over (time loop) so like coincidence on the color choice i think not
Odin would be proud.
My leading theory for the future of the MCU: Since they reference Quantumania at the end of Loki, that means Loki takes place before it. So when the council says "They are touching the multiverse" in that post credit scene, they were talking about Loki not Kang the Conquerer/Ant-Man.  I feel Loki will be their target, and the TVA, more specifically Mobius since it appears he didnt go back to his old life, will recruit the heros across the multiverse in order to defend Loki and the Tree from the Kang variants in the multiversal war.  Mobius and the TVA know what Kang can/will do, but they also want to protect their friend who sacrificed himself for them and everyone in existance. So they want to protect the multiverse, but i think more deeply they want to protect their friend as he did for them. And thats when Deadpool 3 will have that recruiting storyline by the TVA.  I think one of or some of the Kangs will attack the TVA and their new "Avengers" while other Kangs fight the main Avengers/heros to distract/seperate them (similar to the seperate groups in Infinity War on Earth vs. Space) but then ultimately try to attack Loki.  While Loki allows their branches to live, the Kangs strive to be in his postition to rule over the multiverse/ all of time. Loki is basically the new and better he who remains, and since Kang wants control of time i think the Kangs are going to try and take his place back from Loki, and one will succeed and become the Prime Kang and this Secret Wars' version of God Emporer Doom (since we know the heros will lose in Kang Dynasty and come back to win in Secret Wars)  Then with new control over the multiverse, Kang will form Battle World. I think the attack im reffering to isnt more to kill Loki but to replace him. Then in the post credit scene of Kang Dynasty they reveal Loki is still alive after they take his throne and that sets up Secret Wars.  After they take his position on the throne, i think it will allow Loki to transform into Avanger Prime fully and go across Battle World and recruit the Prime Avengers to fight Prime Kang. This time though, all groups will be united on Battle World as opposed to previously being seperate. This will allow them to overcome Kang like they did Thanos.  Loki at that time, would be the best prepared to lead against Kang and make the most sense story wise. Once they win Loki may have to retake control of the multiverse and change battleworld back into the normal timeline, which ends up rebooting it into that soft reboot we keep hearing about.
I wish he’d just killed Silvie, but that would be useless because he’d still sit at the End Of Time alone because Silvie wouldn’t be swayed.   They could’ve shouldered the burden together but she makes him bear it alone. She really is selfish lol, I literally laughed out loud when he told her that last episode. I really don’t like her lol. SMH   It was ALWAYS going to end this way, with Loki at the End Of Time, ALONE. I don’t like this tragedy.
Ok nerd question, in thor we learned that the asgardians are FAR more advanced than humans and that their science is like magic to humana, loki being better at said science than thor even cuz thor is jock brother and loki is somewhat nerd brother. I want to ask WHY did loki not know enough about time physics and mechanics already, he's asgardian and trained by frigga herself, why is his knowledge inferior to OB and VICTOR timely of all people whos not even a kang yet, like even though i love this series and this character i feel he was very quickly disconnected from his mcu lore and past, he's a forst giant turned asgardian by frigga and Odins magic and he KNOWS Odin's magic too. I mean the dude can GIVE life to the multiverse but before he almost felt ....like an average man.
He was burdened with "Glorious Purpose"    Honestly he literally became the savior and hero that he always believed himself to be.   He became the God of Stories.    Also yes I can call him a god with a capital G cause he technically gives life for the entire multi-verse at this point.    huh.  gives life.    If only more gods sacrificed themselves to help others
that last episode felt on par with endgame :0
Loved ur explanation! Thank you!
Honestly. Loki S2 bring back the faith in this multiverse saga, the story this tells is what everything prior has been missing! Keep it going Marvel we need more writing and story telling like this!!!!
Loki is carrying the MCU
I wqnt thqt xbpx pr ps5
Love the last epi
The Hulk is the real savior
I literally cried during the ending..I'm still emotional over it lol
This was the greatest character development of the entire MCU. I can't believe what I saw. OH MY GOD🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥. What's more baffling is that if you think about it, in the very first Thor movie, when Thor is explaining Jane about the Yaggdrasil, and how it connects "all the realms", He was actually talking about Loki. Because Loki is essentially Yaggdrasil 🔥🔥🔥🔥. And from the series, we know that the past present and the future all take place at the same time at the end of time where He Who Remains ran the TVA from. Loki has been the Yaggdrasil since the MCU began🔥🔥🔥🔥. What do you think @TheCosmicWonder?
Dude you are the best
Who ever wrote Loki needs to be writing marvel projects from here on out. 11/10 series.
This episode was phenomenal!!! 10/10 for me I'm biased cuz i love engineering and physics
Man I can’t wait for secret wars
Am speechless, Tom Hiddleston at his peak...just WOW..best Marvel till date
Loki is `The Multiverse' itself
So, it all because of Tony Stark inventing Time Travel and Hulk had to take the stairs 😅.
One small theory I would add - I think Loki is actually creating "time versions" of himself on the timelines he's holding that are purposed to hunt down the Kang variants, which is what is keeping the timelines alive. He said earlier "I will find them" and I think that's what he's actually doing here - inserting time slip versions of himself into each timeline to keep the Kangs checked. The new TVA goals do kind of contradict that, but maybe they're just hunting Kangs on the timelines Loki couldn't get to.   Either way, AMAZING show and great video, thanks!
Loki ≠ God Of Mischief Loki == The Watcher
10 out of 10 my G.
Thor movie was Not really the first to show Yggdrasil, it was Captain America, where red skull explained it when getting the Tesseract
The kangs already exist out side of a multiverse that they have built as stated in quantumania
Sylvie REALLY annoyed me this season. Her stubbornness was aggravating. Her and Renslayer are easily the worst parts of the show
He is god
And so he has become the "God of Stories" :)
Wow thank you!  I really didn’t get it.  Appreciated
This was still apart of he who remains plans. He gave Loki options last season and one of the options was he could control the TVA. He basically is doing want kang suggested
10/10, no question. That was amazing. Epic! What a show and what a finale!
Doctor Strange is creating an incursion by removing the timeline. Loki will fight Doctor Strange.
The power of the multiverse in the palm of his hands.  The Lokiverse.
It seems like he was presented 2 options and chose a third but that’s not the case. HWR told him he’s been alive for eons and this is a game for the young Loki taking his place was apart of his plan.
Dr Strange Supreme  And Now Loki These are most powerful beings of All Times
The Loki series are definitely over the next time. I think we'll hear about Loki is in some marvel movie before secret wars. He'll be in a post credit scene doing something
PS5 please?
This was a solid 10/10. These writers deserve more MCU projects and a raise!
Crazy series loved it
In ending of season 1, Kanga’s gave Loki the option of managing the timeline. It follows this was Kang’s plan to live beyond time. It is possible this loop has already happened before and Kang knew exactly what Loki would eventually do. Now Loki is stuck managing the timeline Kang is free to conquer. Loki will still need to kill Sylvie at the end of it.
So. Can someone explain how the branches work? They aren’t portals. They are a physical thing. How does that represent all live to the point Loki and HWR can basically become capital G Gods?
So it's between Kang Loki Dr strange To carry the multiversal saga..
comment
Ooorrrrr.... he could have just..
What the😂Loki😂

Honestly I heard this theory that Loki in Norse mythology killed baulder and took his place and killed the rest of the gods that weren’t already dead and then tricked humanity into thinking he was this guy named Jesus and started a whole new religion and this show really brought that out lol. I loved it though
His dad would be so proud
I’ve been with y’all since far from home been a fan since keep it up
I was hoping for more Ravonna and Miss Minutes, but it was a really good finale and hopefully we'll see what happens with Renslayer in the future
Sitting at the end of time! Yggdrasil!!
I would love to win that ps5 giveaway pls and thank u
Why not just blank Silvie's mind and make her a TVA hunter?
Was EPIC!!
I just watched it and I shed literal tears at the end when Loki ascended his throne at the end of time. And then when they showed the tree of strings of the multiverse, I cried even harder. I loved this episode and by far Marvels best project 👏🏾 bravo 🎉
I have a doubt, It was Happened the time of Avengers... after that Avengers he went to TVA and did this.. Then how he died again in infinity war..! Could you please tell me
Its Its fantastically
10 goat tv show
What a waste of time this season.
Xbox give away is almost as crazy as the finale
It was a little complicated
Now we know why Green represents the Time in MCU. 💚
it is just ⌛/10
It was beautiful.
This episode was lit
He give everyone free will but Not for him 😢 Also he  became most powerful being in mcu currently and save them from destroyed ❤❤.
I am in love with the Character "LOKI", what a phenomenal stroyline,. A truly MARVELous character development.
Great breakdown! QUESTION: The zoomed out shot of the multiverse tree has a green trunk, symbolizing Loki, but the branches & leaves are PURPLE … Is that symbolizing Kang????
Hi
Such a good ending to this!  🌟✨  10/10
10/10
Dude, he chose nothing. He didn't hear jack that kang told him. He just started the story all over. He is gonna go through what old loki went through. Get bored and leave and kang is right back. My 6 year old figured that out ep1.
The script. The cast all perfect. All episodes was perfect.
10/10 show loki is the absolute goat and we never even knew but maybe he did all along
10 out of 10 best example of what long form big budget story telling could be.
Is that why the time stone is green? ***Shocking*** Best Marvel show ever!
Smoothly removed kang from picture
Wanna get console
Loki might as well give life to not only the multiverse, but also the MCU. 10/10 series
Best marvel series yet. What a masterpiece.
Considering this whole multiverse saga has been nothing but mischievousness, it's fitting that loki is at the center holding it all together.  Excellent finale.
Even if I subscribe and do everything and even won your Giveaway, you wont be able to send the PS5 to India where I live in. I subscribed though. Finger crossed.
This series has been so amazing and it's a great set up for whatever comes next in the MCU. Too bad Ant-man Quantumania fucked up Kang way too early and with Jonathan Major's issues, they're planning to pivot to Doctor Doom. But I guess it'll still make sense since they can just do Secret Wars
Loki is carrying Marvel
I love this series! I am sad that it appears that season 3 won't be a thing.
i would have to at least rate the episode 9/10, i love what Loki does to save his friends, but also kind of sad
This final ep was just everything man seriously loved this series
and is the end of loki?
🤦🏾‍♂️ poor poor people, wrong wrong wronggg!!! I will give you a hint.  He who remains knew Loki would figure it out, he told the lokis when they first got there that he needed them to be there? Why? Loki was already there first from the beginning controlling time when he who remained first got there, remember when he explained time and how his variants met time was like a tree and all his variants were able to communicate with each other, if killing silvy was the key why didn’t he who remained kill her, if he wanted Loki to let her kill him we all know the timelines branch and the whole thing explodes, so at the end it’s the beginning again. Loki creates the tree of time, which the multiverse looks like that all through the marvel adventures we watch, and centuries later he who remains and his variants meet each other discover the multiverse is like a tree simultaneously  and then later begins to fight, he who remained wins by learning the secrete of time from Loki, kills Loki which releases him from his prison creates his own sacred timeline to stop his variants and waits for Loki to come and take his place again👀 HE WHO REMAINS WAITING FOR LOKI!!!
❤❤❤😮😮😮😮😮
The ending was moving!
They can use this to correct the Marvel missteps and make way for the future. And they can use it to restart DC lol
It tries so hard to be the "Hell Bend" episode from Doctor Who but fall short
The feels in this finale, what a story.
Best Marvel  Series Inmyopinion
I hope this isn't the end of loki (it probably is), but what a cool way to end
This is the most perfect explanation someone could ever give. Thanks TCW<3
Hi i just subscribed!!! I just wanted to say i really thought the ending was going to be with sylvie but after watching the ending and hearing your explanation it made so much sense!!! I loved how it ended you were right it was phenomenal!!! Thank you for this video made me more impressed with the show!! Loki never faild us in appearance, movies, and now show!!! Thank you again!!!
what a episode... he tries all the stuff but at the end of the day happens what exactly suppose to
Can someone please explain what the difference between killing he who remains and people having free will and Loki just giving ppl free will? Don’t the kangs kill everything either way?   Or is the point that he who remains can’t be killed unless they kill the loom and that will give free will he who remains never gave them a choice to begin with
He made world tree by timelines
it was beautiful
1. I still don't understand why timelines are dying after the loom got destroyed? Isn't that will just free the timelines, does that mean the the loom is also keeping the timelime alive? 2. Can Loki control the timelines or he's just keeping them alive?  3. Is that tree of life the Loki created represents the whole multiverse or just a the main universe? (My understanding is every universe have their own branching timelines) 4. I thought the timeloom powers the TVA by converting time into energy, how is the TVA still in operation if there is no timeloom?
Xbox series S please
Never expected this ending 🤯.  God of Mischief to Life of Multiverse 🔥
He really made the Qliphoth tree
loki became the god of stories! (at least its mcu version of it) this is so hype! probably nerfed compared to the comics as usual but i wonder what the extent of his power is now and if he will keep it. how will he interact with the rest of the multiverse? cant wait to see. im hoping marvel doest f up his character in the future like they did most of phase 4. this show is giving hope for a brighter future for the mcu. praying its not false hope tho.
Wish they did the same character arc for thor, making him a real God
He is now like the soul king in bleach, great ending! ❣️
110/10 episode loved it from start to finish the music for certain scenes also pulls you in driving the emotions. Loki by far is one of the best characters with the most development. When HWR said how many times have we had this conversation that shook me to the core like "He paved the road, it was HWR along ."
I loved the last episode it's my favorite episode of the attire series and the the part where Loki is walking down towards the sacred timeline that was my favorite Loki moment of the entire MCU that was his most badass moment in my opinion
I understood nothing at all and have 7 billion questions. That's why I'm here.
Loki 11/10 best one yet true master piece.
It was simply mind blowing..
imagine spending centuries learning physics and engineering and it all ended up going to waste... how do you have the mental capacity to continue living after that
the one hour went by like 10 minutes top tier marvel quality
The god of stories and time
Loki season 2 is no doubt a 10/10. Every episode is captivating and without a doubt, no time was wasted in the writers room.
why can't HWR just prevent sylvie from killing him by himself?
I love how this explains why the time stone is green!!!
For all time, always
whats with renslayer at the end? what happened to her?
Twist- mafesto is loki
Can I be enters in the giveaway 😊
Kinda looks like the Supreme Intelligence.
This finale was one of the best out of every television series of all time
Hands down some of Marvel's best work
11/10 literally every episode was a banger hope his Brother Thor can see what he truly is now
So Loki is kinda like molecule man from 2012’s secret wars powering up the multiverse
A Kang took the TVA from Loki , but how since they are keeping track of the Kang variants.
That’s wild 🔥🔥 I needed this 🙏🏼
The man made the ultimate most selfless sacrifice, gave up his time so his friends could have theirs, knowing he can never see them again and finally got his throne in an ultimate act of selflessness. I guess Loki was always "destined to lose" after all.
Loki❤
Awesome 💯 percent 👏🏾
10/10
And OB is still a good guy….
I'm still a little confused, does He Who Remains want Loki to take his place, or just to kill Sylvie?   Because if its the latter, I mean why can't he do it himself? He's literally the master of all time and she's frozen and defenseless.
What a Finale man
MAAAN that was Oustanding!!
I feel sad and happy for Loki at the same time.
hope to win the ps5, also great video
Not my proudest fap
Loki is awesome❤
So that is why Loki's magic is green its not illusion its Time as in the color of Time stone it all interconnects ahahahah Dont worry guys Shehulk is green that means he can replace Loki....
You forgot to mention that Loki is now the god of stories
But how did he became that powerful
Was so dope that they made loki yggdrasil.
The only part I don't understand is why the timelines started dying without him giving them energy.
I really loved this episode, best mcu project in a while, best way to end. Can’t wait what the mcu future looks like. Going to see marvels tomorrow let’s see how it goes
It was insane
Thing is I believe this was also scripted!! He knows what Loki would if this and that….
A small doubt. Can we assert that Loki has essentially become the Watcher after the finale episode???
Kang is going to be a great villain even when you think you’ve won you’ve lost
that was a 10!
Let’s be honest we always derided the Glorious Purpose part and wondered what it would be.. Until now.. 🌲💚👑
Its interesting how the writers chose to go with a tree to represent all of time....much like how in Spiderman Across The Spiderverse they showed the timelines as a tree.....maybe Miguel Knew
about the ps5
Great episode finale, loki saving up marvel again hehe.
I absolutely loved this series!!! Loki is probably my favorite mcu character now!
Mmm, I love a good giveaway!
What if he needs to eat or go pee? Can he get up and leave for a while?
Absolute killer Finale.. and that ending theme that sounded so much like "Skyfall" :))
Hope there's still a season 3
Thankyou for Yr explanation! Very comprehensive compared to the others I've watch, helped me to understands deeper abt the series
A just ate a whole potato while watching this.
This all hurting my head I wish it was simple. This is a bad show and bad Marvel with confusing Multiverse
Top notch episode .  Top notch ending for Loki .  He literally created the Yggdrasil Tree !
FOR ALL TIME ALWAYS ⏳
That is an awesome explanation. To the point. Thank you so much.
I have so much to say, but I don't know how to say it, so I'm just going to briefly summarize a few of my thoughts.   My biggest problem with season 1 of Loki was how incredibly weak Loki felt. Like I don't think he won a single fight that season. So if you told me that by the end of season 2 Loki could literally fart away entire timelines, I don't think I would have believed you.  Also, I hope Loki will be able to continue interacting with the characters in the MCU. He's still the God of Mischief, so hopefully he can cast illusions in any timeline he chooses. It would be awesome if Thor specifically could see how much Loki has grown.
So he's holding that forever? That will be very exhausting and boring. What if Loki fell asleep?
ty for the explanation subbed
No, he who remain can't stop the temporal loom also because it's bound to explode anyway if he die or didn't die. So that was why he who remain brought Loki and see if he was the one to be able to hold the multiverse together, actually he who remain wouldn't have thought it would be possible. He who remain have also went through all the possibilities too. Then Loki sacrificed his freedom to give all of them a chance to live through. Like Loki is chained on that throne holding those multiverses so all he knew can live.
thank you
They’ve set up the perfect stage for a soft reboot. Loki is a masterpiece. It’s the best Marvel has been, period. I’m so happy they stuck the landing

I cried when he sat on the throne bitter sweet.
It’s giving me Mada’am Web

Subscribed, this made it make more sense for me!!
They really set the bar high for what comes next in the MCU. 👏 10/10
really liked the finale, this is what marvel is supposed to feel like... epic/stakes
This series is actually foreshadowing how Loki series is actually holding directionless and dying MCU.
PS5!!!
The best MCU show so far
I wanna know what the heck Renslayer was smirking at !!! 🤯🤯🤯🤯
What an episode! Loki is undoubtedly the best MCU show not only due its strong character development, score, set design, etc. but also because it has real stakes for the future of the Multiverse Saga (unlike some of the other shows). The future of the MCU is bright once again!
I thought the character arc of Tony starc was the best... But Loki's character arc where in the First Avengers movie he commands everyone to kneel before him  and give up their freedom in Berlin to sacrifice himself to safeguard the free will of the multiverse 😢😢.. I literally saluted him in the last scene...  This is the real MCU... An exception from whatever woke BS which is being cooked today....
hes not a god anymore hes The god
Loki!!!!!!!! Love him so much!!!!!!!!
Best Marvel series ever! Epic ending
This is the work of a GOD ❤️
Was expecting kang variants cameo in credit scene 😆
I think rinslayer has to also be talked about alot more
This is what we love about marvel not that she hulk and marvels crap, this is what we need more of.
I would like to see the look on thor's face when he realizes that his young brother that he has been beating up for trying to conquer worlds  is now in charge of the multi verse.
I have no words!! I’ve grown fond of Loki’s character since the first Thor movie and also most especially the first Avengers movie as well!! This episode and the Loki show as a whole has made me love Loki as a character even more!!! it was so sad to see him in pain but then.. my god, that sacrifice!!! The most selfless thing he has EVER done!!! God I completely lost my shit when that outfit started to form on him!! That cape and those horns!! So so cool!! Even though the ending felt final, I’m so so excited and interested for what’s gonna happen next for Loki and the TVA going forward more into the multiverse saga!! This show is going to remain my # 1 favorite marvel show for the rest of my life!!! Thank you marvel SO SO much for doing a phenomenal, insane job on season 1 and 2!!!
From loki wanting the throne Asgard to become owner all time. We all grow up. ❤ what a ending.
Throne granted
he got what he wanted and didn't have to dirty his hands😢😢❤❤❤❤

Great explanation
Love the Loki series
Xbox Series
I love that the writers also paid off that scene from the season one finale that the internet ran with and thought it was Spider-Man No Way Home with the spell that Dr. Strange set. He who Remains was really reacting to the multiverse being obliterated after Victor Timely is killed all along.
Question:-  We saw in past episodes when loki time slips in past there will be two lokis one from past and the one who time slipped  but in this episode when loki time slips he replaces the loki from past??
Dude it was such a good show! Best show this far
Did you catch the Quantumania reference at the end?  “There was a small blip in the 616 universe but it’s taken care of….”

LOKI GOD OF TIME ♾️♻️
I got one question about Loki season 2 episode 6  what will happen to victor timely after loki season 2 episode 6 is he still in tva? Helping Loki? Put back where he belong? I seen no one talk about it
Masterpiece. Loki might save Marvel after all.
Cmon 🤙🏼
I was a bit sad that Loki and Sylvie didn't get their chaotic ever after together
Greatest character development I have ever seen ❤❤
Loved and get it BUT...why does HWR care if Loki kills Slyvie? It's not to save his life. He could just stop her time indefinitely. The only way I see this making sense his 2 of two things. HWR gave him that choice in order to get him to think the only thing he could do is let her kill him...OR HWR paved the road for Loki to hold the multiverse so he was free to do whatever he pleased.
Loki deserves better the ending was honestly sad😭
Episode 6 is a 10/10 like actually
a million out of 10
10/10
Great video
10/10❤
I recently watch attack on Titan final season.. and i think the ending it's just a same like here, like loki season 2🤣🤣🤣
Marvel reached its pinnacle with a breathtaking moment as Loki gracefully opened the door and stepped through the gateway. The accompanying background theme resonated with unparalleled intensity, adding an extra layer of awe to the scene. The symmetry in naming both the first and last episodes of the series "Glorious Purpose" was a stroke of genius, a poetic bookend to Loki's transformative journey. My heartfelt appreciation goes to the brilliant writers for masterfully portraying the evolution of a character from a cunning villain to an unexpected savior of the multiverse.
We can see in the Tree that there are mini explosions. What would what be? Are those incursions? Because we can see before that when the timeline is not yet branching, there are no mini explosions.
As much as I love Hiddleston, you could let this be his final appearance and it would be PERFECT.
Wow. Just wow. This series has renewed my sense of amazement and investment in the MCU. 🙌
Loki: The Time Battery
It's still kind of sad though that Loki is stuck there basically all alone
Thank you 🙏🏽 really was lost for a lil bit lol good insight
My fav series for all time,always!
the writing and acting in this series was top tier
Tom Hiddleston saved the Mcu
10/10
can i have the play station it will be my first gaming system
One of the best costume transformation in MCU History. Gave goosebumps 😰😰
Loki heard Mobius, he’s watching over everyone… I’m not crying you’re crying 😭😭😭
LOKI IS A GOD
12 out of 10 💯 😂
Leave a comment down below
Also loki looks cool like that I love the gold horns but the new horns he just looks more bad a**
Thanks for explaining! I missed the key part of the branches dying when Loki let go. My only critique of the season is I wish they had leaned into Loki’s self preservation instinct. That’s why he jumped in front of Silvie in season 1. He was threatened so he betrayed, like he always does. If he had wrestled with that this season, that final choice to give up everything for his friends would have been the final shift to Loki embracing the good.
Loki forever
♾/10
The greatest show ever. Seems Kang is written off. Kang didnt expect his TVA to go against himself and hunt all his variant down. Loki can control time with his fingers, better than infinity stones. Loki will be the most powerful hero in the multiverse saga.
I was so confused about the final scenes in this season finale
THE BEST WRITTEN MARVEL WORK IN YEARS!!!! I hope the feedback from this series ends up giving us some better Marvel movies yet to come eh? Loki becoming the God of Stories just as in the comics was a very slick move as was integrating the tree of life to weave the MCU/Comics/Norse Mythology all together in a graceful way. Well done.
Awesome series
The top of the tree had a lot of purple light so I’m assuming those are incursions
Oh also I wonder what happened to the Loki he pruned? You think he’s still in the void? And that’s how we get a Loki in secret wars? Hmmmm
10/10 series
when you think about it, it's always been about Loki!
That’s odin’s stead….Loki’s Yggdrasil dear all!😂
This was awesome!!! I cried then smiled when Loki saved the multiverse and his friend!! Definite rollercoaster of emotions and I loved it!!! 🥰
Subscriber once more. I can't believe how many times he had to time slip in this episode alone
Absolutely stunned by the show.
Whataaaa finale
does that tree represent Yggdrasil? ayo
Great video
this episode alone was better than the marvels movie lol
It is going to take a very long time for any  marvel series to surpass loki series
I AM GROOT
Glorious purpose
THIS IS HOW YOU DO A FINALLY!!!!!! Take notes mf’s!!!! Omg I finally give a shit again 😭😭❤️❤️❤️ this was a damn near perfect season with the best ending ever!!! He became the “tree of life”! It was perfect   Also side note that Loki suit up was the best suit he’s ever worn fight me! 😂
Also some of the best writing I've seen in while in general this Loki is the best it's just a little weird not seeing thor 1 more time and is he the Loki at the end of time
Simply Brilliant!!
Loki was peak Marvel!!  I honestly think it may be my favorite Marvel show/movie ever. The finale was incredible and the ending was one of the best moments in the MCU. And Loki’s character arc was just the best thing ever. 100/10
yea but they cant have loki just play a tree in secret wars. so whatever forced reason they come up with while hell then be able to leave and not have the branches die will undercut what this tried to do.
Man became all powerful
Synopsis for "Trapped by Loki, the God of Mischief!"  In Asgard, Loki is imprisoned within a tree until his plight causes someone to shed a tear. He magically makes a leaf fall in Heimdall's eye, causing a tear and breaking the enchantment. Seeking revenge on Thor, Loki takes a mortal guise and transforms people in Manhattan into "negatives" to draw Thor out. Thor appears and cures the victims. Loki reveals himself and eventually mesmerizes Thor, creating a duplicate image of the Thunder God to which Thor hands his hammer. However, Thor becomes Don Bake after 60 seconds, which breaks Loki's spell. He retrieves Mjolnir and finally defeats Loki by dumping him in the water where his magic powers are useless.
God of timelines Loki He replaces he who remains when killed to himself right I also feel he is like Madame web now yggdrasil version 🤨🧐🧐
Who ever wrote this show needs to be in charge of ALL future marvel movies/shows
My husband said it best. This is the best story telling put out since the first Marvel installments. This PROVES that Marvel needs to spend some time on these side stories-rebuilding the lore before trying these big blockbusters again. Literally the BEST marvel show ever and the best storyline of both phase 4 and phase 5
It was a ten
Loki sit at the beginning of time.
If you'll think about it...Loki could've just time slipped back to Endgame, not steal the tesseract so he don't get caught by the Hunters, and then done. It's all normal again.
HEY
Loki is definitely on some Omega level ish now,  also that image of Loki sitting on the throne holding all the branches needs to be a poster ASAP....
EVEN THOUGH THE FINALE WAS AMAZING BUT IT RAISED MORE PLOTHOLES, MORE QUESTIONS AND CLIFF HANGER..  I SUPPOSE THIS IS THE ALTERNATE VERSION MADE MY THE MARVEL IF THE MAJORS TRIAL WENT SIDE WAYS..  SEE, STILL THE HE WHO REMAINS AND THE VICTOR TIMELY IS STILL ALIVE BUT NOT MENTIONED WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THEM..  ALSO ACTUALLY NO POINT OF THIS FINALE GOING TO CONMECT WITH KANG DYNASTY OR SECRET WARS..
Well my solution is , go to eternity and make a wish saying , "stop the loop , stop what's making kang a KANG " BOOM !! Problem solved ... whatever comes next will be lot less than kangs issue Which TVA could solve it
Ok so how the multiverse is the same as the timelines now. The inconsistencies lawd
Bro cleared all my confusion on why and how Loki did what he did in the finale
IM honestly confused. How did a 2012 Post-avengers Loki got his time-slipping at the end of Season 1 and implied more powerful than the original Loki? HWR doesn't explain anything about that. Ending is kinda bummer for me, Loki will always be alone, a sad ending for me.
Major plot hole is Loki can’t sit there for ever.
This has been one of best marvel productions ever , I hope we get to see more of him in future ❤❤❤
Can't loki just do the same thing as what HWR did! Let Temporal loom(the failsafe) handle the branches and sit on the hwr throne instead holding the branches and sit there! I mean what is wrong in what hwr was doing? What good did loki do now by giving an end to hwr, except the pruning and mobius's dream of surfing😂
Absolute legend! Marvelous series especially this season! Just Epic beyond proportions! And extra EPIC FOR LOKI!!! What an evolution of his character 💯🙌🙌🙌🔥🔥🔥😎😎🤙 kudos to everyone involved with this show ✌️
Loki sitting on the throne with all the branches interconnected somehow reminds me of the post-credit scene from Shang Chi.
I was so confused the entire time. Mesmerized because of how beautiful the visuals were, but still confused😂
thanks.....i was so confused
Loki defeated thor finally
This the best marvel TV show hands down and the best thing since end game 10/10 ❤❤❤❤
I’m trynna get that ps5!
By far the best season of any show Disney has put out for marvel
I love how this show carries the mcu, in my opinion but also, season 1 ep1 shares the same title as season 2 final ep
season 2 finale was so epic that nobody's talking about that it got no post credit scene
Standing ovation 👏👏👏👏
I hope Marvel understand that a movie is about a story, no matter who is in it, it is about the story. They can save themselves money and drama if they stop making movie about political views and bullshit. Write good stories and we will be here, every time and always.
Loki could Astral Project to different timelines as well
Marvels today should be good
After this series and his development, I think I like Loki more than Thor now honestly (at least this version of Loki).
Finale 10/10 series 9/10
Anyone saying he needs an Oscar is Glazing, but god this was absolutely insane!!
I think you explained it wrong. He who remains said the loom is a failsafe that leaves only the sacred timeline and then he rebuilds the TVA easy to keep pruning branches and NO multiversal war. What Loki did was destroy so the loom so the branches continue and bring the multiversal war.  Tbh Loki is a selfish POS lol this series did not help his character at all
The final scene of this movie reminds me of the movie The Fountain by Darren Aranofsky. The Yggdrasil kind of reminded me of the Jewish ʿĒṣ Ḥayyīm.
Props to Johnathan Majors.  Didnt get the real threat vibe in Ant Man, but he definitely delivers here bewtween He who remains giving presence and authority and Nathaniel being timid and unsure. Loved it and was curious as to where he'd end up.  Still cliff hanger-ish.
Frankly it felt like loki , tom hiddleston carried all the hate and burden of MCU  AS LOKI AND SAVED IT, IT IS UPTO MCU TO SAVE WHAT LOKI SACRIFICED HIS FREEDOM FOR !!
Loki is the He who remains.......the Asgardian god.... they've to build something which can hold the branches force... which loki is holding in throne
I am genuinely curious about what this means for Loki and Tom Hiddleston. This really does feel like a fitting end for him. Because if they bring him back or another version of him back, it will defeat the purpose of his sacrifice.
nicknames!
here me out this may sound crazy ...we know loki cant leave his throne but..just like he can conjure projections and time travel back to his younger self minds...maybe he can project his mind into his other variants or a specific variant making him prime/avenger loki who helps our heroes ..
Loki's evolution! 🤯
This was the best Marvel series to date. Absolutely great entertainment.
Show is great 👍🏼
This is what the marvel films need!!! No political shit, no PC shit! Simply a great story!!
If time lines and variants are in a single universe how TVA is impacting multiverse? Is there timelines and variants in each universe 8n multiverse? Is there a TVA in each universe? How timelines cause multiversal incursion? If there are infinite variants of kang in each universe will the kangs in each universe unite and fight against other kangs in another universe or no matter what timline and universe will fight each other. How timelines and multiverse link each other. Please do a detailed video if possible. That would be great.
Just finished watching. He who remains saying "who paved that road" was both terrifying and an excellent call back to s1 finale. Loki went through so much just to give himself for the others. Marvel is healing🙌
Does Loki come back after this?
Ending was something else 🔥
That final was so epic and confusing at the same time but i loved it !! Thanks for the explanation tho, good work🙏!
the question is what will Victor Timely do?
What if Loki sitting on the throne is also part of HWR's plan?
The Glorious Purpose 🔥
LOKI is the new AVENGER
The way MCU developed Loki's Character is mind blowing!!!
You see, he who remains watched the timeline from afar, but Loki watches it from within.
Bro loki pulled so many timelines all at once🤯😨 so he's the strongest character in the mcu now bro is literally holding the multiverse in his hands
Words can't describe how good and fulfilling the finale was. The Loki series, in its entirety, is certainly one of the best MCU projects we've had so far. It gets me really excited for Deadpool 3 and Secret Wars.  But I really wished there was an end credit scene linking directly into Deadpool 3 or other projects. Even maybe a cameo of some sort would have been awesome.  This story arc was truly the redemption of Loki, but I think it is also the redemption of the MCU. Leading towards more quality projects following this storyline. Can't wait for what's coming next in the Multiverse saga!!!
I hope he can start sending projections of himself anywhere and be a watcher. I can imagine next Thor movie if Thor is about to die or is getting beat he can hear Loki's voice and an image of him on his throne smiling flashes through Thor's mind. As Thor stands up he smiles and says I see you finally found your throne little brother and whispers "thank you".
Wow!
Meh!
10000000/10
Is Loki more like The Watcher now?
Mobius asked Loki in the first episode if he eventually wanted to rule the universe after he conquered Midgard. Now he has. He's ruler of every universe. And he's alone. Just like Thor said in Ragnarock, it's what Loki always wanted: to be alone.   Burdened with glorious purpose, indeed. Odin would be proud of his son.
He basically became GOD...if only his brother, Odin and figga can know what loki grew up to be, they'll be very proud
as much as i enjoy the light hearted stuff in the mcu, i really yearned for this type of content in marvel. everything about the finale was perfect.
So Dr. Doom gonna give Loki a run for his money??
One sec I have to pick my jaw up off the floor......Damn one of the best things I have seen in all of television. I watched this episode 2x in a row.
Will Loki be free and ever reunite with Thor ? Also What is the temporal loom? Who created it ? Why? What was timeline structure before temporal loom ?  I really want the Thor and loki reunion.
💚💚💚
Loki is a true Hero for that 💚
This loki don't even know she have a sister
loki series needs an oscar
One of the best endings in the MCU
So he is the temporal loom now I wonder how this works going foward
I get those same ol dreams.. same time every night.. high in the clouds then I wake up.   Great series thanks for breaking down so quickly after.
I want to propose we call him the loki above all
So what happens when Loki needs to use the bathroom?
Tom Hiddleston has become the character.  Marvel's Loki will always be tied to his performance.  Truly iconic.
Mine Blowing .Solid 10 for me
Loki❤
Basically Loki become true hero. The most selfless God, gave his freedom so every living being have freedom and chance to exist. Damn, this series was beautiful
Loki has finally infinitely one upped his brother.
Amazing I want thor to meet this loki
100/10
hi....recently started watching your....entry for giveaway
Alone Again (Naturally)🎶... Damn it Loki😔
Hands down for the best series of MCU
I have to commend the cool costume they gave Loki at the end.
I honestly don’t like how everyone in the MCU is thinking that Kang the Conqueror is dead from Ant Man and the Wasp ant man think he is dead the TVA think he is dead even the other Kangs think he is dead so he is off the radar but when he comes back it’s going to be scary and catch everyone off guard!
10/10 best ending god of stories..just perfection
30/10
the power of time is the greatest power
amazing!
Perfect ending, a sad one, indeed. Now, I have some questions. How will Thor take this news? Was Loki wiped from everyone's memory except his TVA pals? Did Ravonna encounter Kang after being pruned? If so, was it Kang from 'Quantumania'? If so, maybe he got 'pruned' and this is how he came across the 'Alioth' and tamed it.  That's why you don't hear the Alioth roaring at all because Kang had tamed it and that's why Ravonna wasn't scared after seeing and hearing it roar.  And so, oroboros loop is still in tact.
10/10 best series on Disney Plus
Loved it. Literally could have skipped all of phase 4 and just watch loki and be solid. BLACK GIRL MAGIC
I am a solid WandaVision fan but damn I must say that Loki Season 2 is my number 1 Marvel Disney+ series now. The best (and perfect) finale ever. I really, truly hope Marvel gets back on track after this series. Can't wait for what's coming next.
This was Low-Key great!!!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!GLORIOUS PURPOSE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Loki got his throne 🙏🏽
The score, the cgi, the writing it was all just so good.
Excellent finale and the nod to the Norse and Celtic tree of life at the end was well done

They making kang look weak😂
Awesome❤
Like Yggdrasil
Finally a worthy season finale. Completely unexpected. Loved loki❤ what a performance and story. Yeah need your explanation to understand what the hell just happened and that's what I'm here for.😊. Perfect season by MCU so far
Great Show 🤝
This ending was incredibly bittersweet.
That ending was above and beyond anything I was expecting
10/10 ending
Was a 💯 completely amazing
10/10
To think back now, from the Loki in   the first avengers movie to the last episode of the series was incredible to follow how they put it all together phenomenal work 💯
Someone needs to explain to me how this leads into the post credit scene of quantummania where all the kangs show up
Was a 💯 completely amazing
Loki can solo thanos at this point
so my thing is this with Loki so tom has always played the character phenomenal he's great but for me I just never felt like they presented Loki as a truly powerful god in the mcu like pretty much all they did with Loki was have him fight with his knife and do disappear magic but I always felt like Loki should be way more powerful then what the mcu presents him Like now l love this because Loki actually feels like a actual powerful real god in the mcu.
#11:05 Kang in Quantumania
Loki is by far the best character in the MCU!
it was the best episode of a disney plus show i have seen!
that's great
Burdened with Glorious Purpose! Brought me to tears when I saw the sacrifice he made! Really brought it full circle to when he told Sylvie that he doesn’t want a throne. The throne means he is alone 😢
Was a 💯 completely amazing
greatest of all time
Was a 💯 completely amazing
I loved the review and the final episode 👏👏
Loki isn't a God anymore...he's THEE GOD now.
THIS IS HOW YOU WRITE!!! ( Mike Lowrey voice) FROM NOW ON!!!! THIS IS HOW YOU WRITE!!!!!
Please give me Ps5 if is it possible for you. I have never played on that. Btw Loki is Phenomenal ❤🎉
oh hey, your explanation totally make sense ; paying ways to upcoming Big Marvel movies... (now I go watch other Channels explanation), but can't wait for the new Movies.... (ya I re-subbed Disney and ya I understood the raise of sub fee , gosh, matching the exchange rate huh, but I finished watching new ones than they can come up with new ones... just hope the end of writer / actor strikes can help with that...). Also watched The Marvels, totally love it.  I would love a new YT episode from all the Marvel YT creator channels telling me what to expect for Phase 5 (finished watching pretty much all the new stuff.... err, ya I didn't watch Starwars stuff on Disney, but hey,.... I want more Marvel stuff.... )
If the Loom exploding destroys all branched timelines, how was Loki able to time slip to BRANCHED timelines to find his friends in episode 5? According to He Who Remains, they shouldn’t have existed anymore.
BRAVO!! BRAVO!! Encore  because this show is absolutely amazing
Loki is now conqueror 👊
I hope y'all change that thumbnail because this just spoiled the finale for me before I got to watch it
No with your thoughts revise everything that I thought I knew he was going to be the God of stories and essentially the God of The multi verse but it will be awesome to see him. Reunite with Thor which hopefully will come sooner than later.
Loki 😘 keep up the work bro 💪 woof woof.
It was incredible. 15 out of 10
In all honesty that was incredible. I’m gonna take a shot in the dark and guess they’ll adapt the Secret Wars story line and Loki will be the equivalent of Molecule Man
The series has been good but that finale ATE. Still got the chills!
It was a great ending!
A bit underwhelming, i was expecting HWR to at least go down in battlefield with the multiversal war himself (or repeat his arcs).. instead is just repurposed himself all of this because he was bored of all the games.. I understand why they have done this (so that they dont need bring all this characters in the movie, so that the general audience dont watched this can enjoy the kang the conqueror itself).. I kinda wished they copped him out somewhere liked quantumania did with their version..
So you could say Loki's power scaling is infinite, because of the infinite growth of the multiverse.
This is really crazy !!! Not only Loki replaced the temporal loom, all the timelines in the multiverse is now fueled by his magic ? Like....they are now green...before they were multicolor ( the colors being of the infinity stones ) !!! That means, infinity stones will no longer be the greatest power in the multiverse, but loki's magic ? It reminds me of what he said when he found them being used as paper clips at the TVA .... 'Glorious Purpose' This title is just perfect !!! For the first time....and i mean it, i felt the godly presence of Loki...when i saw him on that throne i was so happy....he  did'nt sit on it bc he sought for it, he sat there bc he had to...and that makes him even more worthy to be there !!! I hope he won't have any beef with Eon ( the entity that is in charge of the flow of time ) !!! I'm sure he will...anyway, i don't know !!! Wow !!  I am Loki of Asgard, and I am burdened with glorious purpose.
So Loki is now the entire MCU. lol
I wonder if they’re done using Loki or will Secret Wars release him from his trap
Man it was one of those endings that just make you sit there after the credits roll and ponder what just happened. The last 12 years has brought him to this point, what a crazy story arc. 10/10
This finale was crazy. I didn’t even know about the god of stories until I looked it up after the episode ended, and now I’m actually excited for the MCU’s multiverse story. Great vid btw 🤟
good finale!
I don't understand one line said by He who Remains that I've seen timeslipping before ?? How has he seen Timeslipping before if Loki timeslipped just in front of him for the first time for He who Remains but he said he has seen it before How how ???
Man the BEST Finale, Bravo 👏👏 10/10.
Thank god i already watched it before going to YouTube
_The writing was MASTERFUL!_ _And it tied in so well to everything and Loki's mythology._
He can hear everything while he’s holding the branches. I’m thinking maybe, I’m time, after Loki knows all things, he will find a replacement of some sort to hold the branches then he will become the most powerful multiversal superhero alive. But his weakness is, he can only jump in time where he once was. He can’t jump anywhere, unless he might learn that while holding the branches together. Idk. Loved the series though
…centuries later 😂😂😂
💚 loki
best show ...and finale
This finale was so great, definitely the best Disney+ finale in my opinion I can't wait to see where things go in the future.
What a finale.Mind blown 😮
Loki is definitely carrying MCU right now. What a series ♾️/10. Kudos to the whole Loki series team, from the actors, writers, everyone. 👏👏👏
Marvel for gods sake you did well here. Leave it and don’t make a season 3.
Another thing to remember about world tree is that because the 9 realms were located on the branches of the world tree they were essentially directly connected to each other hence using the bifrost made it possible to travel to different realms. So in this same way all the multiverses are branches of world tree. existing on the same place in a way. That means there is now an equivalent power of Bifrost but allowing multiversal travel instead of realm travel. Sounds like the perfect precedent for Secret wars gathering villians and heroes other than using the quantam realm.
Feel like the show rushed Jonathan Major’s role in the MCU…. Loved the series, but feel like it should’ve ended with more.
Oden would be so proud.
It's sad that Sif's words have come true. "Loki will always be alone." . . . . . . . I'm not crying, you are.
This season was so good! I have not been enjoying the MCU but this was awesome.
1000/10
Loki closing the time loom doors behind him is a call back to Armageddons Bruce Willis moment...made me cry 😢
Loki was crazy!
Season 1 was my favorite Marvel show/film of phase 4. Season 2 is, so far, my favorite in phase 5. Magnificent!
10/10
Awesome story 👏
100/10 🥲♥️
Great ending, I was not disappointed!✨
I bet victor lives at the TVA now. What else is he going to do? He can't go back.
It was by far best show of Marvel.  We could have seen some more kangs reference. Yet kang as bigger threat that Marvel is brewing should send some of his henchman like in Avengers loki was for Thanos
Loki was Marvel at its absolute best! Spectacular show! Acting was impeccable. The story was perfection. This is going to be a show remembered and used as an example for top tier storytelling for a long, long time.
I am so glad they gave him a REAL ending with a genuine self sacrifice to save everything, instead of writing some last minute cheap way to stop the problem. The finale was interesting and super captivating.
love the content!
The season finale was absolutely amazing! I love your video but man I’m so proud of Loki! This is going to be awesome. Can’t wait for the avengers. Still hoping we get to see Loki and Thor meet. He would be so proud of his brother
Will there be season 3 for this series?
Such a great season! For those who didn't see it i suggest you do its definitely worth it.
Best marvel series
can we expect loki appearance to help avengers as a big man in end when avengers are unable to defeat king variants
Loki never wanted a thrown but end up with a thrown
such a GOATED finale 🔥
Loki god of stories supremacy!!!
Thoughts on Loki season. 2  What do you guys think of the season 1 finale still ? Does it hold up now if season 2 finale surpasses it?   Also I find sylvie annoying for some reason, I’d be fine with Loki killing her.  I do wonder if this was all He Who Remain’s plan for Loki to become the loom
You fr giving away a ps and xbox?
I so hope there is going to be a 3rd season
Loki season 2 finale is the peak 🔥🔥 10/10
What does this mean for secret wars though?
Loki sacrificed himself for the greater good and to give people free will
If that D head Star Lord would've STFU in Infinity War, none of this would've happened.
I need ps5
Im totally broken after this episode peak cinema peak Marvel tom Hiddleston 👑🐐
Loki became avenger prime
10 ; but I am still trying to figure out what happened (feels in a loop? doomed to repeat? dunno.  but it kinda make sense implicitly); but I am here to watch explanations. thanks.
Best Disney+ show
The series of Loki season 2 should pen secret wars and kang dynasty
I NEED THE PS5 NOW
Is it me or dose the timeline stream looks like the bi-frost bridge on Asgard…..? Especially when someone is traveling on the bi-frost. Better question, since Heimdall can control the bi-frost, can he send people through time….? Because the further in space you travel, the further in time you go, past or future. Hummm😮
The evolution of Loki from the first Avengers movie where he held people hostage to this finale is the biggest magic Loki has done! Heartwarming, inspiring and EPIC!!!
epic!
Loki has found his own Glorious Purpose! He becomes God of Everything. What a character development.
It is definitely 10 out of 10 the best Marvel movie/TV show ever. It is absolutely spectacular I was very impressed
How about season 3
Was expecting more smh
I was actually disappointed he could’ve easily had her read his mind to know she didn’t need to kill him
Beautiful show overall 👌
So did X-5 go back to cell or Loki also give him free will
Best show on Disney+
100/10 holy shit I can't comprehend!!! for everyone who thought  Marvel was dead after  endgame. Go f yourself holy shit hahaha
He really did mean when the said the…..”YOUR SAVIOUR IS HERE”….
LOKI JUST BECAME GOD OF THE FKING MULTIVERSE!!!!!!??
I feel bad for Victor. In all of those times Loki went back, never was it hinted that Victors will ever faltered. Knowing that he could die but was the only one who could do it, he went out there every single time. I hope we get to see more of him in future, present, or past ⏳
loki is just like the most op dude now, above the level of dr strange, Wanda, and even Thor.
what happen to victor timely?
hey wait its a tree the world tree Yggdrasil and in comics and mythology thor one shots and destroys the multiverse holding tree does that mean thor will do something that loki would be free ??
Does this mean He who remains that sat at the citadel is gone?
I do wonder how this will work because we know the multiverse war is going to happen kang will return and his variants so eventually loki holding all these time lines won't mean anything
its so crazy that he is literally holding the new multiverse in his hands
The single greatest piece of cinematography I have ever watched
This show goes hard
We can all agree that Loki was our last hope of good Marvel content, and it didn't disappoint 🥺🫡🔥🔥
No Thor and Loki reunion😡 what a big let down😫
good video
Is just makes things more complicated
Loki - God of Multiverse ❤️
It's so depressing tho and the fact that he just have to sit there for eternity
1 TO 10... A MILLION.. THAT'S WHAT I RATE IT... Loki's is vulnerable though. Kangs can trace the radiation of the magic Loki has used to keep the timelines alive. Kill him and recreate the loop. And now with the possible recasting, the TVA will never know what hit them, because they will never be able to trace these Kangs.
I'm so confused.  Why does Kang want Loki to kill Sylvie?  Kang can obviously stop her anytime he wants.  Why was Loki time slipping in the first place?  How did Loki become as powerful as the Beyonder?  I really wanted to like this episode.  The imagery was very cool.  I liked Loki's arc.  But I just don't know if I buy how we got there.
Whatever happens I need to see more of Loki - he’s so cute
How do we know for sure the he who remains Loki left after that conversation is dead?
I cried... Cant move on from this 😭😭😭😭😭
I thought that Loki season two was neat. Excited what will happen next
What does this mean for the Marvels or Doctor Strange 3?? Do you think the Council of Kang’s notice Loki giving the multiverse life?
Best Episode Of The Show and one of the best Marvel episodes. Brilliantly written and executed. Tom deserves a Emmy Nomination. This felt like a Series Finale. Best MCU DisneyPlus Show Yet.
So in a sense Loki became God itself
Waste of a season to be explained in a couple sentences
10/10
edge of tomorrow :)
The tree of life, and why time stones have always been green
Best marvel show!
Loki greatest marvel series ever 👏👏
Cant believe loki literally got the throne to the multiverse after all that time. He even called it in the very first episode
10/10 episode
It was the best episode of all time❤️‍🔥✨️ ♾️/10👑  Proper Comedy (beginning scene, Timely one specially 😂) + Proper Plot Twist (That these all r made by He Who Remains to Loki) + Proper Suspense (That have to kill His love, Sylvie, in order to save everything... or keep going like this in loop) + Proper Character Development (Sacrifice himself, to save His love Sylvie nd everyone nd all timeline) + Fulfilling his Glorious Purpose (Loki Become king, literally multiverse king nd take the throne) (literally marvel tease this since Thor 1, ofcoz they that time didn't know as well, but still) + A Proper Emotional Ending (Literally Loki Sacrificing himself, to save His love Sylvie nd all of his friends nd everyone nd all timeliness... nd taking the throne, were too much Emotional) + Teased Upcoming biggest project, Kang Dynasty (Tva monitoring on He Who Remains Variants)  Best, just best✨️
Who ever directed this deserves a Oscar
Loved this series and the journey of Loki. He is literally burdened with glorious purpose
One of the best projects of MCU
The ending was just good. really emotional and cant believe this happenedd
Reincarnation, Baby ! damn you HWR. he paved the road to become Loki as God of Stories.
give me the xbox
WHAT AN ENDING BITTER SWEET.  😢😊
Y a y ! you are so close to  1 Mil. Cant wait for you to hit that milestone.
Loki so damn op
20/10
THE FINALE WAS AMAZINGGG. he looked low-key depressed at the end tho
That ending blew me away 🤯 best Disney plus series hands down imo!
This ending is interesting I wonder what they will do with Loki
Whoever wrote this series needs to write the rest of marvel please 🙏
crazy good finale
Bro is beyond omega level
Wonder if 'He Who Remains' saw this coming 👀
I loved the finale
what happened to victor timely though?
100/10 this was sooo perfect for the character arc of loki and and such a excellently written story soo good this is what marvel needed right now
That music when he’s grabbing all the branches and walking up and on his throne was soooooo good it’s a 10/10 for me
That was a crazy final. I think loki decided to become the new he who remains to protect all the timelines and the TVA & the universe. Favorite Hero: Batman
Best marvel series of all time period
am going to watch it soon
The horns on his horned helmet were so long, I think the longest horned helmet he's ever had. 😂 I loved that outfit he had at the end it was so over the top and so cool at the same time kind of looked like pajamas too. Lol at least he's comfortable alone at the end of time.
Perfect
That was definitely peak marvel series . It was amazing, when I saw the Yggdrasil tree I was soo shocked, but in the comics it’s said to be infinite multiverse so it makes sense. ATP I think thor is gonna become RKT too, doctor strange will become Black Priest, Scarlet witch becomes HOM level, like we seeing their peaks before the leave us. AMAZING season finale
First
10
Loved the series and how loki now basically is the strongest character in mcu 🔥
Loki should pick up Thors hammer in Secret Wars
