Bruh link telling him to say aqua gotta be the funniest thing ever
Link is making me laugh so much in this one LOL
this is so weird, who gives their wife a hall pass period? who knew rhett was a cuck..
The beat at the end of this video was from the OCD Song. I remember it well since I still listen to it.
Link was fn dedicated lmao
Its so cuteeee omg 🥲 Rhett and his wife are so cute together 🥹
I just realized Rhett is taller than Jason Momoa , he a big dude
It's unfaithful to have a celebrity hallpass
When is the Link - Kieth Urban version
Okay
Great idea
His what 😭
OMG who doesn't love the Momoa look
Bro is ready for the "CHICKEN JOCKEY"🗣️🔥🔥🔥
Honestly , Rhett > Jason Momoa. Plus Jason is apparently an ass hole IRL, Rhett’s personality is everything.
@13:47 we feel ya Link.................hilarious!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
No self respect.
10:57 I like the “historically inaccurate vikinger” look on Rhett
"are you asking me to participate in a th..."   Uhh, link, where you going with this?  "thirst trap video?"
"aquaman", "im a Marvel guy". Genius.
3:10
As if Rhett isn't enough of a thirst trap already 😍
Jason wants to marry me
😶😐😶Aquuaa
“Just to make her want me” I’m dead
Rhett has an assassins creed Valhalla look to him
one time in 8th grade a photo of jason momoa popped up on my phone and it froze for literally days on end, like frozen on his face and after just dying it never turned back on for several days. for this reason, i never allow a photo of jason momoa to stay on any screen of mine (phone, laptop, whatever). i've strayed away from watching this video for this reason too for THREE YEARS after always seeing it on my suggested. i think its finally time tho. im watching the video. pray my screen doesnt freeze for three days straight
Still waiting to see the Link as Keith Urban photoshoot
Bloody HILARIOUS!!
She has a total type
11:13 “this is what they call ‘wet mamoa’, uh, it’s almost like a mimosa” gets me every time 😂😂
"We have Jason Momoa at home"
Why did link dress up like Luigi
That was actually so cute. And he actually really does look like him, especially in the last pic
Is it just me or does Rhett's replica of Jason Momoa's appearance look sexier than the real deal?
the 7:18 "aqua" got me craccccking up haha
Rhett lowkey looks better in the pink outfit. Dont @ me. Lol.
I'll admit Rhett got hot when he grew his hair out
That was awesome! Great job guys!
Aquaaa
Ah that’s why Rhett is so hairy nowadays 😂
😢 14:11
Got it 12:22
Rhet looks much better.
11:21
ICONIC
but can jason momoa be rhett? 🤔
W
Rhett is way more attractive than Jason Mamoa 100%
awww sooo sweeet
We need a Link Keith Urban video!!!
I explicitly encourage this, here in the comments.
Ready for the Keith Urban
You only have "goofy missionary " ... We saw the funeral 🤣
"by her?" 😂
You knowwwwww she grabbed him after this was over lolol
That is so sweet❤🎉
He looks like the nightman.
Classic... DIY at home Jason mamoa
Came back to watch this absolute classic
we need to see Link doing this for Christy as Keith Urban, its been 3 years it's time for part 2.
More cowbell haha
this is love if my husband doesn't dress up as Milo Manheim I wont believe that he loves me
"make all your muscles bigger"😂😂😂
Rhett is so hot 😂😂
didn't Jason touch tips with kids tho 😒
If my future partner doesn't do this for me, I don't want em 😭
it’s link’s turn to become keith urban for his wife
Dear Rhett and link, I know one of the reasons you guys don’t post vlogs anymore is because u think we won’t appreciate them because they’re shorter and less thought out than your normal content. But I think I can speak for all the mythical beasts out there and say you’re wrong.
Not gonna lie Jenna is a straight up 10. So beautiful even with a mask. Lol
Jason momoa is hot. Even I was sad when his character died in Game of Thrones. So now it's funny and cool making Rhett look like him
My girlfriend’s hall pass was Jason Momoa and then they started working together. Not often, but occasionally is enough when you’re talking about Aquaman and the woman you want to marry hanging out all day.
i felt relaxed watching u together u r a cool couple
i felt relaxed watching you both u r both cool couple
*Rhett Becomes Jason Momoa for His Wife
What is the thought process that goes behind “let me cosplay as his character that was a murderous rapist”?
my wife's hall pass is Jason. Next thing he says if he could have them meet he would help. Damn Rhett did not know you were like that
photographer link is so cool 🥹
The cone is a pounamu (green stone) necklace from New Zealand. Traditionally they are given as only gifts, someone cannot give themselves one.
Link:  “Thirst trap”  😂😂
Link shines in his controlling elements here. He was born to give direction 🙂
Sooo bad hope his wife enjoyed
Jeff Bridges on Ozempic lookin ahhh
Me too
Jenna is stunning omg she's gorgeous
Rhett you're the sexiest man in Burbank and link Lamont is just jealous, happy link?
I’ll be honest; Rhett isn’t far off from a Jason Mamoa look-a-like. He should be happy knowing his wife’s celebrity crush is basically him, but slightly different.
1:17 the eye twitch w along with the yeah she doesn’t know
I think it turned out great!!! I wonder what Jason Momoa thinks about it 😂???
"I don't want any credit on this job."   *is in the video*
A lot of viking energy in that Khal Drogo cosplay. lol
Not to be creepy, I know she's married, but when she says Hi......WOW! That southern draw though.
waiting patiently for Link's Keith Urban shoot
I love that rhetts wife's hallpass looks so much like rhett already
Idk why but "I have a garden hose" was just so funny to me. I think it was the sincerity
Smile I want to see all types of teeth.  Smile big so we cna photo shop teeth in later 😂 when link said that I  about died laughing 😂
WE NEED THAT LINK AS KEITH URBAN VIDEO IN 2024
14:40 "McMomoa"  i'm fighting for air.
Really surpired people arent calling him beta or simp, there is hope
She is waaay out of his league.
Link we're still waiting for you to become Keith Urban for Christie...
The way way Link laughed when he said his wife’s hall pass was Keith Urban 😂
this is really sad
I totally forgot i was watching a video and thought i was chilling with y'all ngl
Rhett really hired Jason Mamoa to take photos for his wife and didn't think we would notice.
last part is the best.
Its the thought that counts... Im loving the thought
He's Ronon Dex!
Might be easier to do Shroud of Turin.
who tf laughs like that (rhett wife)
Jason Mamoa for Rhett and Zelda for Link.
Jason just got a TikTok, He's actually down if you have Hog or other MotorBike and he happens to be near where your at.
Jenna's got back
i saw the thumbnail and i thought i was looking at bulder from GOW but it was just rett
Is Link not going to make a video like this too?
Rhett looks way better than Jason, kinda like a Viking actually
12:53 we’re involved so Rhett can claim this gift as a tax write off 😂
I’m still waiting on Link’s turn
Omg the book! It's perfect lol
Rhett is the accessible boy next door Jason Momoa. Rofl Proof that there is a Jason Momoa for us all out there lol
Not a t-shirt with muscles and tattoos!!!! Rofl
I feel like Rhett could benefit from the countdown smile technique. As someone who has a hard time holding a smile, if I grimace as hard as I can then count down from 3 and swap to a smile, it looks 100 times more natural.   A tip for anyone who feels like they are bad at smiling for photos.
Question is, how did the make up girl fit into those skin tight ass jeans?
Her reaction was just great.
At least Rhett kinda looks like Jason and link kinda looks like Keath urban….😂
I think real rhett is better than mamoa
What a nice gift to give her. Happy birthday and many more.
Why is his wife Anna Paquin ?
All im saying is the assistant is pretty 🔥
Rhett looks like the Brandon Farris version of Jason Momoa
Link's "I got a garden hose" 🤣
"I don't have a smile in my repertoire of faces" 😂😂😂
This is so sad
"aqua makes man happy"
Not gonna lie, Rhett makes an amazing Khal Drogo!❤
Rhett’s wife is lovely! Her voice is so sweet.
i love how Link has to describe the jason photos to him rather than him just looking at them LOL
That was so awesome bro. What a great husband.
Rhett you should wear more pink
Links celebrity hall pass should be Paul Rudd
It's a throwback video but I love to watch their vlog style. It's a nice change every now and then.
Ooh you are insecure about your relationship to the point where you made yourself look like Jason Momoa just so you can see your wife look at you like she looks at him 😂
Link could Urban
The fact that she kept looking at Rhett's picture More is very telling of just how much she loves Rhett. You're perfect for each other.
Thank you that’s awesome. That  you share that with
you both seem so happy to just hang and record like u guys did so long ago !! should make more vlogs . miss these :)
That's hillarious..😂😂😂
I forget where I saw it but the funniest roast for Rhett I ever heard was that he looks like Jason Momoa poorly drawn from memory 😂
"i cant be happy like this" 😂
their wives picked guys who looks like their hall pass 😂 love it
horse flesh
Actually I dont think he's that far looking from mr.  Momoa!  Hello hot either way!😊
This is hot AF.  You’re wife is so lucky. Haha
This was so great! Lol
Ok it was cute and funny until the wet tshirt contest then I was blushin 😋
kinda crazy how he has a wife who DOESNT think hes the sexist man in the world, i hope he was joking lmao
SO DANG FUNNY, SO DANG FUNNY xD I liked all about this vid man.
Maaaan this is fun=D You shoulda done the one where he's sneaking up on Cavill with Link^^
The Walmart version
"AQUAMAAAAAAAAN!" - Johnny Depp
I can tell she has a type
Rhett’s got some dope albums on his wall
Wife: I like Jason Momoa. Rhett: But we have Jason Momoa at home. Jason Momoa at home:
Aqua makes man happy. That's all I have for today.
WHY DID THEY NOT ACKNOWLEDGE HOW CLOSELY RHETT RESEMBLES JASON MAMOA? COZ HE REALLY DOES also link and keith urban, i can already picture that transformation
I'm not even going to watch the video because you said her celebrity hall pass was Jason Mamoa ... I'm a real man and my woman has no hall passes only the front door
I thought Rhett and Link were a couple.
Jenna is a rockstar
That pool looks like a gator lives in it.
wow crazy that Link got to do a photoshoot with Jason Momoa
Now we need Link as Dana Carvey.
She was hoping to see your trident.
This is so adorable
I only just realized how accurate Rhett’s impression of his wife is
If Rhett would shorten (trim) his upper lip hair we’d be able to see his TEETH!!!
And then they had missionary s*x😂
Funniest thing i've seen in a minute
Not thinking the pounamu necklace was a cone 😩😂
should  be steven adams, hes like momoa but bigger lol
His wife’s reaction is so cute😍😍
Link getting jealous was so funny😭😭
In some alternate universe Keith urban and Jason momoa have a wildly popular YouTube show
3:56 Its a pounamu necklace
not khal "draga" 😂
I encourage Rhett’s decision to do this and whatever ego boost he may have gotten from it 100%. Best present ever, eternal laughter. No wonder they both seem so happy.
I am going to ignore Link's advice and say Rhett looks too much like Momoa
Jessie's laugh makes my heart melt 🥺
This is a man who loves his wife 👏🏼
Totally get it. I see it and I love it. A very secure man. Keith Urban? 😮
That was cool sorry I was late
Honestly this video was adorable ! And Rhett really rocked that pink fit !
IMO Rhett is way hotter than Jason Momoa
Nah bruh if my man likes another woman why he even with me 💀 even with my bf ion obsess other dudes like that
I want to be this secure
bro u forgot to wet ur beard it
I'm like 2 years late to this video but i love it sm 😂 Link getting upset at the end is hilarious, I want my bf to do thiss hahaha
Momoa or not, Rhett is a handsome fella 🙌
Bro this is absolute genius
Two years later and this is still a great blog
The fact that Rhett is 6'7" and only 190lbs is hilarious to me. Rhett... Start a 5000 calorie/day diet and do a few pushups.
Her face when he said it's about daddy😂😭
Honestly this is such a confident thing to do, respect to Rhett
Now Rhett looks way hotter than Jason Momoa.
Rhett Momoa is my favourite star wars character
Rett, you are sexy as all git out, but you are no Jason Momoa. Psst: Maybe manscape the beard a bit more... LOL
That ended rather abruptly. 😜
Thirsty☺️❤❤
Awe
Okay so actually- I kinda REALLY want to see Link as Keith Urban😂😭
*encouraging Rhett in the comments*
I know they smashed after she saw that book
Rhett has a better beard though!
You are a great husband 🫶🫶🫶 Your beautiful wife is over the moon 💓💖💓
Aqua makes man happy!
Legendary 💪
"Horse Flesh".
His adorable wife has a very "Sookie Stackhouse"  vibe.  I've been rewatching  True Blood.
Encourage Rhett!!
im cryinnnn
Jason is HOT! RHETT doesn't need to be Jason! He is HOT the way he is! I wouldn't turn him down! And.... No I'm not a man.
Omg Rhett’s wife laughs like me! So rare to see an inward laugher.
Jenna is pretty :o
Rhett, your wife is a sweet saint.
poor jenna had to make/procure all this stuff, she deserves a raise 😂
" I know you don't cause you're really secure" is the new "I know you don't cause you're a cuckold"
C'mon Link. This was a great video. Don't get mad we're not filming catching a dead rat
"This isn't about being beautiful it's about looking like Jason Momoa" SIR I HEAR CONTRADICTION
That was the sweetest thing I've ever seen ❤👏👏👏👏👏💐
I miss the vlogs 😢
Why didn’t they use the pool
Hmm...now that I think about it, I don't think I've ever seen Rhett and Jason Momoa in the same room... 🤔
I have his number Rhett no worries.
KEITH URBAN IM CRYING
i miss the vlogs so much
Jenna is beautiful - let’s just say it!
I stg Link keeps switching green hats.
I learned recently that Jason Momoa is my sister's celebrity crush too. My mom's is Tom Selleck (she's just about obsessed), and mine is Cooper Barnes.
“Horseflesh” had me fuckin dead 😂😂😂😂😂
Jenna can get it call me
Ikr right reply
Your wife's reaction was priceless and so was links reaction throughout the whole process thanks for the laughs brother that was funny af.
There needs to be a revised version my hair goes up and my hair goes down!!!!!
9:40 Im so deaddddd🤣🤣
I'm not sure if Rhett looks more like Jason Mamoa, or the long distance jogging version of Forest Gump.
I'm still waiting for Link as Kieth Urban... maybe someday 😢
Really nice records in the background there
10:31    Horse flesh
Jason Mamoa is pretty to everyone ❤
Sting as a donkey: 10:00
Rhett doesn't have the muscle cut, but he does have the shoulder size to pull this off really well. Dam impressive for someone that doesn't professionally train.
i fuckin love jenna lol
Rhett is so sexy dressed up in the pink lol ..he is very handsome
😂😂😂😂🥰
Rhett - "It's pretty much a spittin' image, right?" Link - "I just don't know how to respond to those statements" 🤣😂😂
Why would this be something my boyfriend would do? 😂😂😂❤❤
bring back the vlogs 😭
What a great bday gift. They're an adorable couple
I saw Linc & Rhett on Jimmy Fallon's show & I thot Rhett was Momoa. I thot "y has Jason lost weight?" They. really do look alike😊
The Australian Cowboy…. Why?
If women don't find you handsome, at least they'll find you handy
I now it's years too late but it was not a bloody cone he was wearing it's a greenstone, a toki. Traditional maori greenstone necklace
Best video I’ve seen yt in a while! 👍🏻
I sure do miss these vlogs 😢
This is so funny and the end is actually pretty wholesome
Imagine doing a Jason Momoa bit and then not even using him in his prime when he was on Stargate 👁
Ребята, я чуть не описалась от смеха, пока смотрела и от ваших диалогов с Линком во время съёмки. Соседи не понимают, почему я так громко смеюсь. :D
I'm just here to say that Rhett is infinitely hotter than Jason Momoa and you cannot change my mind
Im not trying to be purposely weird, but I have a crush on Jenna now. Thank you
15:35 i can't lie rhett killed it on that one
Instead of "aqua makes man happy", he needs to say "dressed like a bat"
This was the SWEETEST gift!!
these are so fun, they should bring back the vlogs
this is my favorite ret and link video because... hehe!! so funny!
wow thats uncanny i did the same thing for my wifey but my celeb hall pass was brad pit wich was hard because im asian
"Now make all your muscles bigger"   😆
Brah…you two guys were HILARIOUS.  Great vid🤙🏾🤙🏾🤙🏾
Dude!  I’ll never get over how Hot😍 Jenna is🥰🎼🤙🏾
Aqua makes man happy lmao
I bet they had sweet sweet missionary Mamoa style after this.
I’ve always thought he look like him lmaoo
At a recent Keith Urban show in Madison, WI someone brought a sign saying Keith was her celebrity hall pass or free pass. Was that you Kristy?
13:09 Lol Rhett looking like a rickshawala
Too bad Links wifes hall pass isn’t Garth from Wayne’s world cause that wouldn’t even require any work.
Doesn't he look like Klaus from Umbrella academy in the pink outfit? 🤓
Her laugh sounds like Seth Rogen mixed with a dog squeaky toy
She might as well put a cornetto around his neck xD
Jasons been real quiet since this droppes
Why is link being such a jerk... Sorry but he was at the end... I still love you guys but really
Rhett’s hair used to go up, and Link’s went down. Now Link’s goes up and Rhett’s goes down!
Please start posting more to this channel
bruhhhhh did rhett grow out his hair and beard just to look more like jason momoa? XDDD knowing that his wife loved him
Very sweet Rhett,  For your wife's birthday.  Thank you for sharing! Impressive! You too Link,  You're doing this for your best friend,  sigh! And Jesse  loved it 💚
Life goal: a partner who is secure and funny enough to do something like this. I would accept such an act as a proposal too
They should redo the fotoshooting with the longer hair summer 2022
Ummmm he doesn’t even come CLOSE TO You ~ I have no interest him!! I Don’t understand women!!! Your The Hunk ☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻😉😉😉😉😉❤️❤️❤️💕💕💕❤️❤️💕💕
Is link’s wife’s hall pass Luigi? Because he’s dressed like him the whole video.
"This should have been left between you and your wife. Why am I involved in this?"  Nope. Not touching that one. XD
amazing
a wet momoa is almost like a mimosa lol
I can't hear anyone wearing a mask
“It ain’t about mom it’s about daddy” 😂
This is the best thing I have ever seen 😂🤣😂🤣
This was great!
AWESOME
I swear Links celebrity doppelgänger is Paul Rudd 😂
I can’t believe they got Jason Momoa to take pictures for them
Is anyone attracted to Keith Urhban is a lesbian
This is hilarious!!🤣  What an awesome man and husband you are!!
Nice mask 🤦🏻‍♂️
I don't care what you say when I'm gonna encourage Rhett
Wait, Rhett married the female equivalent of Link (short brunette) and Link married the equivalent of a female Rhett (tall blonde)? 🤯🤯🤯🤣🤣🤣
I want the Kieth urban video pls
Rhett looks hawt
This was so cute. I'm happy both of you guys found love and it's made it through the fame.  It's very refreshing to see this type of content.
I think you are better looking than Jason
My dad owns a restaurant and Jason momoa went there! 😃
Haven’t laughed as hard as I did watching this in ages. But now I need to see Link as Keith Urban 💀
It would be much easier if Rhetts wifes celebrity hall pass was one of the Duck Dynasty boys.
Hahaha I love how Link said Keith Urban...it's said I love my wife but I'm gonna judge her taste a little bit.
So, still waiting for Link to be turned into Keith Urban for his wife 🤣 Letttssss goooooooo! 💜😆
So this is the sweetest sentiment ever ^_^
Rhett: what do you think? Wife: I love it. Rhett: 👀
“Horse flesh!” 😂
12:48 Had me cackling
The velvet look, for the velvet hook
Idk why but Link matter of factly saying "I got a garden hose!" Made me laugh out loud. 😂
Link could reciprocate for his wife as a hot Jason - how 'bout he buffs himself into a Jason-Shane Scott? 😅 They already look related.😆Link might have a future in Lifetime movies.
Rhett is handsome on his own but i feel like he would genuinely look like j.m if he just had more upper body muscle its actually kinda wild
12:38
'Be legitimately happy'
Wow, So cool that he did that for his wife's birthday... What a great couple they are...
Jenna is so loyal to these to I think she would chuck a crow at a window for them 😉
This is hands down the cutest sweetest thing i ever seen a man do like i love how secure you are Rhett 😭 i love it ❤️
Go for it dude!
Am I the only one who knows him from stargate atlantis?
His wife looks super similar to him. I always find it funny when I see married couples get older and start looking similar somehow haha
When you order your wife Jason Momoa from wish
This was well worth it.
I have his number,  that's my cousin!
Ion do all that Hall pass stuff, I'd end up killing a whole celebrity 🤣
Next: Link becomes Luigi for his wife
Ew
The thumb nail on this lol 😂 Ok I am rofl
ohh how California has made you a weak man Rhett
now i really wanna see Link's Keith Urban lolol
the fact that rhett's beard and face aren't wet in that last shot 😂😂
Imagine if someday we get an episode featuring jason momoa as a guest, it would be amazing
Idk if it's for "Humor" or what but this is the side of link's personality I dont like.
Nothing screams im very secure like going "oh my wife likes this man well I am this man now so she only likes me"
I think youd actually look more like jason momoa if u painted ur eyebrows differently, its about the eyebrows that make his face look this certain sharp
Great video, but I was digging on Jenna 👀
Right from the jump, Rhett almost gives his wife the green go for “meeting” Jason Momoa lolol If she ever gets his number Rhett, stop it before it starts😂
She got cake tho.
14:48 🤣 the look from her absolutely priceless these 2 are adorable
That was sweet
I love these best friends!
Well, that was super sweet, ngl.
Keith urban 💀💀
I laughed sooo hard while watching all on this lol!!!
I am not sure about getting involved in looking like Jason Momoa either Link.
We need a Link Keith urban photoshoot!!!!
And here we find out that rhett is into being a cuckold , and wants to arrange for his wife to get with her hall pass.... Sometimes these guys overshare
Definitely prefer Rhett to Jason 😍😍😍
When he said, “by her,” then he scrambled to fix what he said lol
Rhett is sexier than Momoa.
That assistant look cute
The man didn't do a single push-up? Gotta take a tip from the body builders and get a pump on before the shoot.
Now what if a man would ask their woman to look like... uhm.. IDK maybe Anya Taylor Joy, Mila Kunis... No idea, any star.  *Don't try it!*
He's not pretty to me, Link. You're not alone brother.
This is hilarious 😂
This is true love.
I almost ran him over once when he was in our town.  I just thought he a homeless dude at the time till I saw he was in my city
Link isn't having it
this video bussin
This is for Jenna: Awesome Dragonball mask!
Hey Rhett, I think you make a great Awkwardman.
Lol. He looks more like the older dude with white hair. From that TV show Z Nation. That guy had some awesome hair.
Jesse's so pretty! Your son Locke got Jessie's looks and your eye color,  hair texture and skin tone! What a perfect blend.
I died at "then I gotta get wet again,"  "I got a garden hose" 🤣🤣🤣 2:58 - 3:03
They made Rhett have those 17th century woman sloping shoulder
THIS IS THE CUTEST THING I'VE EVER SEEN
Jessie: "I know you don't [mind] because you're secure"  Me: have you never listened to your own husband's podcast??
I need the Try Guys to make Keith look like Shawn Mendes
Awww I love how much Jessie and Rhett love each other.
Bro😂😂😂
Bro😂😂😂
Man, and when I want my girl to be someone else for the day, I get bitched at 😂
I love Rhett but he looks like the wish version of Jason momma 😂
these two are incredible together lmao
Better be careful since Jason is separated from his wife.
“Horseflesh” 😂
BRING BACK THE VLOGS !
Jenna’s perception of scale is hilarious
Rhett is way beautiful, but I love that links wife's hallpass is Keith Urban, can we make that happen lol 🤣🤪❤️❤️❤️ "I don't love what this might be doing for his ego" Link and Rhett, get it ❤️🌹👍
Now that's funny.
his wife is gorgeous 💕
Please bring these vlogs back
I’m encouraging him in the comments
She is so pretty
WE WANT MORE VLOGS
Jenna 😍
This is such an awesome, sweet birthday present!
Mclaughlin? Right, More like Mcfreakingsmooth. Beautiful.
Actually, there's a similarity between Rhett and Jason Momoa. :)  Such a sweet gift to his lovely wife on her special day! <3 Good job, Link and Jenna and the photoshop guy! <3
Rhett and Link really need to bring the vlogs back, the videos felt so fresh and new and also so home made like it’s just Rhett, Link and an editor
Jason and Lisa are separating!
Now we know what Link's limit is...
This is quality content 😂
Hi
shout out rhett for listening to atcq
If I ever get married I could only dream of my partner going to such lengths for me
They totally kissed in the end
Mimosa!
Link getting slowly jealous of Rhett is the best thing. 😂😂
My hubby kinda did something like this for me. Also Jason Mamoa 💜 he let his hair grow out and grew a little but of a beard. He’s back to normal but for a couple of years 😉
Link's green outfit is basically my style. :{
I love videos that can't actually make me laugh out loud!
“you need to be genuinely happy.” rhett: ☺️
I met Jason Momoa in person and just about melted. His voice 🤤 I'd probably melt if I met Rhett too.
has ur wife been smoking for 88 years?
it's so craxy how Rhett actually looks like Momoa and Link definetely reminds me of Urban!
I don’t know but this kinda makes me sad… like if it were me trying to dress up like someone else my self esteem wouldn’t be happy
Jenna is a fox
2006
Momoa is overrated. Bfd.
After watching the Sextember podcasts, this video has a whole new level of interesting to it.
I loved it! You DO look like him it's not that far off with The beard and hair my dude and don't let Link tell you otherwise!
9:25. When they realized this isn’t gonna be perfect
Wet Momoa or... Whett Momoa? Hmmm? Ahhh?
Bring the Vlogs back!!!
WE GOT LINK 1:03
I am actively encouraging this behaviour, here in the comments!
My Man 👊😎
Rhett always reminds me of Jason lol. My bro in law looks exactly like him it’s insane and I’m so jealous of my sis lol. And of Rhett’s wife!!!
She does look like Ilana Glazer 😅
“By her?” 😅
Ya know that last pic, Rhett should've had the silver bracelet on n Jenna could've just drew on the design the best she could of Jason forearm tatoo!?
The alternative title: I became my wife’s boyfriend
Jessie: "I like Jason Momoa" Rhett: "But honey, we have Jason Momoa at home...." *Jason Momoa at home:*
That’s fun 😃
I see what you did man! Everytime she tries to picture the actual Momoa it'll be nothing but you on her internal hard drive lol It's never gonna be the same for her... She def liked it tho cute gift man.
I am here to encourage Rhett.
Rhett should get a mullet
Don’t fret, He just went for milk.
It’s giving William Wallace
Happy Birthday Rhett.
6:00 If that's not the most Rhett thing ever, I don't know what is 😂
This made me laugh so frickin hard
Are you gonna do vlogs again
Rhett looks more like Daniel Bryan from Wrestling
Rhett's cone is bigger than Aquaman's
jenna bad asl lmaoo
When she says hi.....wow.
Subscription im Track Taiwanese food💖
LOL THIS IS WHY RHETT HAS BEEN GROWING HIS HAIR OUT
I am encouraging this
OMG!  Which one is which? hahahah
*”And then the world went dark.”*
Can you guys post more on this channel?:( this stuff is so fun and wholesome
Cute
Go Rhett
Wow it's been 15 years.
They just reached 5 Million Subscribers, Congratulations
You are very rich hire me
Except… why does he actually look… a little bit… like… Jason Momoa…???

Maybe we should call him Rhett momoa
5 mil!
can we bring back vlogs please
have you guys stopped making music? will you ever make music videos ever again?? I'm just wondering because those were my favorites ever
rub some bacan on it
Hi I’m your 5 million subscriber:)
Almost at 5 mil
remake old video
succes mr rhett
I'm starting to think this is what Link was talking about when he said 'Stop making sexy father time happen'
Can't decide which I love more - but, SHE is such a sweetheart! Happy belated B-day from OR :)
Rhetmoa!!
Rhett is like way more attractive in my opinion but im not into muscley guys
They’re on 4.99 million subs... let’s hope we can get a 5 mil special vlog
i would love to have a husband who does something like this for me. They are so lucky to have each other!
Rhett go to horny jail
Please stop happy birthday girl
theya re at 4.99 mil subs?!
Rhett's hall pass is probably Rihanna
Ok this wouldn't work with my wife im 36 and she likes Liam Neson... Not sure how to take that
This was brilliantly hilarious. Loved every min. Esp the Aquaman photoshoot
I see a Sturgill Simpson album on the wall!!
Rhett is handsome anyways though
Rhett just wanted to get laid more😔🤣
*encourages rhett*
Link is jealous! Ha ha!
"You said pipe three too many times!" So quotable!
https://youtu.be/VyzrxEFGOCM
I feel like they should have made an attempt to comb his beard
Encourage, encourage, encourage, .... there you go
So funny
Rhett is the better half of GMM yep that’s a slam at Link. Link is a spoiled little brother that’s needy, and Rhett is the big brother that cares for him so Link stops crying or getting hurt. Because Link can’t listen to the sound of reason. Rhetts a better friend than Link is.
That's what fun and secure marriage looks like!
Birds are singing
Rhett sometimes looks like a psychopathic cult leader
Actually miss, Khal Drgo is everyone favorite character. lolololololol and yes Momoa is everyone's favorite fantasy.. yummmm
love that both their wives celeb hall passes emit the same vibe as rhett and link. like they definitely both make sense 😂
The fact that Link didn’t pose as Henry Cavill for a bonus photo based on the Tackling Momoa meme makes me a little sad
Olha só que música  show https://youtu.be/nK1wPoTw_OU
WHERES THE VLOGS AT GUYS >:(
Waiting for link to turn into Garth 😞😂
i love how you can clearly see that there were more pages of that book we didnt get to see xD
Khal No-go
Great job Rhett!
He looks like someone you'd see at burning man
That's true love right there.
Rhett actually looks like Bryan Brown from the movie FX
kid: i want jason momoa mom: we have jason momoa at home jason momoa at home:
I’m not sure the assistant makes enough money.
We need more from this channel 😭
Rhett is WAY cuter than Jason Momoa. Just saying! haha.
Tvt
Where's the sauce, y'all? More fire.
I think it's kind of sweet that both the wives hall passes look similar to their husbands.
I thought it said, “Rhett became Jason Momoa’s wife”
Hahahaha we all have Jason Momoa in our celebrity hall pass.
no... just no. i would have to be very very very drunk LOL!
The only problem is that Jason Momoa is a p*do 😅
i started watching GOT hahahah i thought of rhett the whole time lol hahhah
“Now make all of your muscles bigger” 😂
Holy crap me and your wife have the same name ... very interesting
His wife looks like a really nice lady ggs
Best birthday gift ever!!!! Sooo cute
So this is the so called, “Walmart Jason Momoa”
Jessie's laugh is so CUTEEEE
I'd like to see Jason do a photo shoot as rhett
He looks like a Tribes person gone crazy.
He already look like him without the make-up.
She is fine af yo
jason momoa from wish
Everything in me hopes Jason Momoa sees this and does a response of him doing a Rhett photo shoot. 😂 the commentary is amazing
Happy birthday
Rhett walking in with the pink suit looking like an LA shaman.
Here’s wonderwall
Rhett(guttural voice): horse flesh Link: make all your muscles bigger 😂😂😂☠️😂😂😂 Also hearing Link say thirst trap for some reason really amuses me
Su funny also interesting how much confidence R & L have in Photoshop
That was just too sweet and beautiful! I love it!
I hope you guys upload soon 😔
I got a garden hose! Lol -Link
Shes got a type that’s for sure
Did Rhett get burned when he was Drogo? He has stripes on his shoulders in the wet shirt scene lol
14:49 her face lmao 💀
7:01 😂
All Rhett needs is another 15-25 lbs of music and he could look exactly like a pale Jason mamoa😂😂😂
Jenna Fine 😍
I KNOW that Link is not homophobic based on his inclusiveness and general mindset, but all his comments started to verge on homophobic behavior, as he seemed worried about how "into it" he thought people would think he was feeling. I would think Link would be more confident and wouldn't need to voice those thoughts so frequently, or for them to be left in the edit. I was kind of sad by that.
Ahahahahaha
Hahahahahha
This was cute
I remember a time when they were kid friendly smh
l love this
Damn Rhett's wife is gorgeous 🥵
have u done the truckers hitch yet?
" I don't know photoshop. I'm not a magician." 🤣
jessie: "i've only ever said 'i love you' to two men my entire life: jason momoa as khal drogo, and a guy in a dark club, who i mistook for jason momoa as khal drogo."
Ngl probs my fave Rhett and link/gmm vid lol
she loved it! so cute!
This went from kinda cute to very strange then back to cute
Nice video...
This message my day. I laughed so many times, my husband was annoyed. 😂😂😂
Just putting out there that Jenna painting his chest and spraying him with a hose while giggling was completely inappropriate. If my man did this I would not be cool with it.  Jenna was low key flirting with him the whole video.
How did Rhett not dye his hair for these photos?
I am not sure if Rhett McLaughlin looks like Jason Momoa.
They can just never decide if they wanna keep uploading to this channel huh
Pull down the muscle shirt!...😆😆
This has got to be the cuckiest thing I have ever seen.
That was adorable.
The Jason Momoa at home be like:
0:16 lol you gets it alright....now I understand why the look you took in life Rhett.Just joking you guys are the best carry on! :)
UUUPPPLLLOOOAAADD SSSOOOMMMEEETTTHHHIIINNNGGG
Please make more video on this channel 👍
Congrats for the 5 mil on this channel!
wow! you guys got jason momoa to do a vlog with you!?  envy doesn't begin to describe it.
I like that she wasn’t biased.
Link: I’m a marvel fan 🤣
Awesome idea!!!!
Link kind of looks like paul rudd on low resolution
Jessie’s reaction to this is so amazing
This is so sweet. I always smile when I watch it
im not gonna lie but rhett legit looks like jason mamosa
Still waiting for a Link becomes Keith Urban vlog
Rhett is definitely sexier than Jason!!! 😍🤤Your wife is one lucky lady! Sorry Link 🤣
And they're gone again
Do another video please
Bring Back LTAT or the Rhett and Link Vlogs lol I miss something on Saturdays
Should have dyed his hair black.
T-Shirt idea!!!! We will buy it!!!!!!!@!@!!!
I am encouraging Rhett's ego.
Rhett does all the suffering. Link does all the complaining.
Guys, please, more vlogs, these are amazing!
2:17 AKA Link having concerns
Frankly, he is even more attractive than Momoa
Way better looking than Jason imho
Link is so insecure lmao
Where are they now?
Idk how they got Jason Mamoa to come here and recreate those pictures
Me: can I get a Jason momoa Mom: we have a Jason momoa at home
4.99m subs
I miss the vlogs, please make more :(
My dad met Momoa
where did these vids go i miss these
@5:59 she found him attractive lmao
i want to do this with my husband too and he looks like a kpop star lol
why link looks like Luigi
Has anyone noticed that links hair goes up now and rhetts hair goes down
if my future husband doesn’t dress up like sebastian stan i’m divorcing him
No rhett..you look like Joseph Seed without spectacle...
What would it profit a man to gain the whole world but forfeit his own soul...
I love your videos!
Rhett Momoa in pink is a vibe....
They got some Two Steps From Hell music in this video and I'm loving it!
I miss the vlogs so much 😭
NOT RHETT ACTUALLY RESEMBLING JASON MOMOA AND LINK RESEMBLING KEITH URBAN
That “Cone” is a green stone it’s a Maori thing
Hilarious, next birthday bring her to meet him!
Very nice video and Happy birthday Jessie
all the people looking if the real jason momoa commented
I've just watched all of the vlogs and I'm so upset that this is the last one. MORE VLOGS 🙏🙏🙏🙏
Wow Jason
Really clever idea.
*patiently waits for Link to do this*
Awe this made me smile so hard =D What a lucky girl <3
the fact that they didny unwrinkle his shirt bothered me so much ahaha
Rhett and Link? More like Poop and Stink
So we all know why rhett grew out his hair and beard now
Does someone know where I can find this outfit or what it is called? 8:04 😅
I know what i want from my husband for my birthday. This, but Kim Namjoon.
I loved this whole thing what a cute and creative gift to give his wife
His kids are gonna see this 😂
Rhett is way more attractive than Jason ✌😌
zoned back in to rhett saying him and his wife only lay each other
I’m dying laughinggggg😂💀
That is not the kind of woman I thought he'd be with.  When she's looking at the album, she can't stop looking at Jason. And she's super ditsy.
Jessie showing her face on camera
Jenna lookin kinda stacked there too!
Love that they stay active on this channel!!!
Happy Birthday Link.
4.99 mil subscribers
They finally showed her face?? Did they also show link's wife's face???
“Can we photoshop teeth” “that’s not my department” LMAO
you should try Kristofer Hivju too. =))))))))))))
"I'm a Marvel guy". Aquaman is from DC. HAHHAHHA
L: Say Ahhhh R: Aquaaaaaaahhhh  I'm dead
Why is Link being sour? He's jellyyyyyy
Did they seriously call Jason’s necklace a bell ? 😂😂😂
Is Rhett secretly the last and only living caveman?
ITS AMAZING BROTHER
I MISS THE VLOGS
The best line... "I've got a garden hose". Absolutely perfect.
Rhett and Jessie are tooo cute <3 OMG
Wow! I laughed so hard. Don't worry Rhett, he is every woman's hall pass.
I wonder how many people have Rhett or Link as their hall pass
Jenna needs a raise for going helping her fort year old boss turn his wife on.
I want Jason Momoa to watch this.
Now Jason Momoa has to recreate different pictures of Rhett
https://youtu.be/eIUyqhpG-Cc
Bring these back!
@Rhett, I know you are from the NC area. Do you happen to know if you have Scottish ancestry to the McDonald clan? Reason I ask you look kind like the guys on my mothers side of the family.
Hawt hahahaha
How dare y’all fire Stevie for this crap. LTAT was better fasho.
I just got Rhett and Link at 500M!!
Almost 5 million subs mega epic
Jenna got 🎂🎂🎂
Happy birthday Jessie .....intersting  rhett make over by the help of his friend link....to be Jason momoa....
Almost 5 mill
"My best friend Link." That made me so happy oh my gosh.
Jason Momoa is sooo HOT 🥵🔥 like Flammin hot 🥰💖😍
I just admire the lengths he went to for his wife. ❤️
nobody: link:"I got garden hose"
This is actually wonderful 😂
That laugh tho, in the beginning was ... Don't know what to say
Why is Link dressed like Luigi lollllllll
I think rhett should be jason momoa's hall pass too <3
i miss these vlogs
Thinks Link is insecure with his sexuality!!!!!
I have been following these guys for years now, but it's ridiculously obvious that Rhett has adopted the California homeless look. I really miss the old Link and Rhett. I like the Carolina Rhett and Link way better than the Californian "help people till you hurt them" and "everybody deserves a trophy" way of life they have adopted.
More Jenna please
Jenna’s brilliant 😂
Has any else noticed they have been on 4.99M for the longest time?
Its disappointing we never got to see link as Keith urban
Well done
I have watched this many times, "I wonder what this is doing to Rhett's ego" 🤣🤤🤣🤤🤣
Adorable. Truly. Love wins.
@jasonmamoa
Why does Rhett look like a scuffed Skyrim npc tho
Omg I laughed so much about this video! It’s perfect! 😂😂
i want more vlogs
Anyone else wished they still made music videos? I love the vlogs but I miss those
F for you guys dropping out of the NEXT FOR AUTISM campaign! Shows where your priorities are!!!
Low End Theory. Nice.
haha
Happy birthday, J. Great work on the pics.
My wife's hall pass is also Momoa. My hall pass is the hot lady that works in the pharmacy at CVS. It's her bad for picking someone she'll never meet.
So close tk 5M subs!
Rhett, you so nasty 😂.
I was wondering when they were going to make this video. I've been noticing a resemblance with the hair and beard.
I used to watch your video then I stop but now I fawnd your YT
Rhett, I laughed so much I started crying 😂 I’ve met Jason and he’s such a nice guy
Happy Birthday Jessie!
hola y muy buenos miticos dias🇦🇷
“Your hand looks right” I’m dying 😂
I miss you guys! You're almost at 5m!
Jessie becomes Rihanna???  👀
jason mamosa is hot!!!!!!!!!
Jenna's reaction at 6:00
we want link's turn!!
"Mom I want hot aquaman"  "We already have hot aquaman at home" Hot aquaman at home:
Jenna is a sweet soul
looks like the cult leader from far cry 5 🤣💀
Rhett is wayyy hotter than Jason Momoa 😍
A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one .
Jason Momoa: Hot.  Rhett trying to look like Jason Momoa: Homeless Gremlin.
this is so funny
ALMOST AT 5  MILL POG
I find this inspirational, in that if Rhett can become Jason Mamoa, we all can.
I'm getting Corridor vibes
that was worth the wait lol
he actually looks so much like jason mamoa in his facial features
Here before 5 mil
link looks like banner hulk
hahahah legends
RHETT CAN YOU PLEASE DO THE NO BEARD FILTER!!! PLEASE!!!!
Jasonnnn😩🤤I love that man but happy belated birthday 🥰🥰
Can’t wait until 5 mil

Me: imma just skip ahead  Me two seconds later at 12:38: wha-
WHERE IS LINK URBAN omg I can't wait for that one!!
Fan was needed on the pink shoot but this was so much fun!
This might be the greatest collab in history kinda wish we had more Rhett but thats ok
Jenna Purdy is gorgeous
Must be nice to have love😔😔
13:54💀💀💀
I neeeeed more vlogs! Lol love this channel so much! Maybe almost as much as gmm and gmmore💛
Rhett is so fluffy!! ^^
Didnt even realise this came out until I listen to the EB. Urghh i missed out. But imma just like the video before finishing it. Cause i love these boys that much
Why is their assistant so fine bro😩
Legend has it. They're still sorting their mail to this day
I know what Rhett is wearing for his wife on her birthday...
Next episode: Jason Mamoa turns into Rhetts wife
Why is this actually better than gmm and gmmo.
WE NEED LINK TO DRESS UP AS KEITH URBAN
Very sweet
😂
What a really sweet gift. Can’t imagine any man in my life doing that. None have been that secure. Go for it Jesse
I know Jason Momoa I'm friends with his kids
So this is why he grew out his hair
Lol😂
When you accidentally step on your dog's tail 00:08
lets get this video to exactly 69420 likes
10k subs until 5m pog
Assistant thicc af highkey
He just gifted his pictures on her birthday
Vote for Jenna’s own Youtube channel with all the things she makes behind the scenes.
Should’ve had Rhett do some serious push ups or lift some weights right before these photos... like they do with the actual actors. 😂
This is amazing
I miss you so much 😭
It's so easy, a caveman can do it  -Geico
I think it's so cool that you did this for you wife. That's Real Love from a secure Man!
CLOSE TO 5 MILLION SUBS
I love this video, the akwardness made it even greater🤣
Rhett looks like a Farcry villain.
rhett is a tribe called quest fan? nice
2:34 Wt#### was that link?!
LOL
He looks more like a skinny kratos
This was hilarious! 😂 Link definitely has to do Keith Urban
YO THIS WAS POSTED ON MY BIRTHDAY
Hey Rhett and Link! You guys are almost at 5 million subs on this channel! Congratulations!
4.99 million subs
HORSE FLESH.
In an alternate universe Jason Momoa is trying to look like Rhett for his wife's birthday because it's her hall pass
photoshop some teeth XD
so he turned into a Viking ?
💁🏻‍♀️Not only does his wife have excellent taste, but........ Suddenly, Rhett’s reason for growing his hair, is quite obvious.
Okay but this is literally so precious 🥺
Omgg they NEED TO DO LINK NEXT!! KEITH URBAN 🤣😂
This dude got laid after this.
jenna gon make me act up…
Plot twist, Jason Momoa gave his wife a Rhett photo album.
Jenna has a great body ❤️
👀 👀 👀 🚬
This is actually really cute and wholesome. Aww😂
😂
Can you guys pleaseeee do a cooking competition like Iron Chef with a secret ingredient?!?! 🤣  I would love to see your cooking skills!
I REALLY enjoy these videos so much! It's like I'm actually hanging out with you both. It's a nice side to see.
Love these vlogs
Retts wife is so pretty
10:18 Hearing Rhett in my mind: “He’s just a kicker. But he’s crazyyy!”
jenna is smoking gawd damnn
So funny! 😂
I never realized there was a Rhett & Link channel and I have to be totally honest this is amazing. The best part for me personally has always been about the relationship between the two of you and this channel highlights that amazingly.
Jenna doe 😍😍😍😍
She has a type i see....
You forgot to do Momoa as Conan the Barbarian 😀   This was great to watch!
rhett, drop that curly hair routine
Rhett is now Jason Momoa for life
LMFAO more cowbell (only true fans understand how that has anything to do with taco bell)
Forget about DC, Link looks like the guy who runs hammer tech from Iron Man.
LMAO!  IT'S  like a  gecio  commercial  cave man!
I'd love to see Jason Momoa react to this, I think he'd get a kick out of it
Rhett if you’re not Scottish, are you Irish?
I miss this channel
This was freaking awesome.
I have been watching for a bit now and I can say that I need the laughs that y'all cause me to have! IT IS GREAT! I am from Darlington SC and keep hearing reference to SC and NC. Where are y'all from?
Now we want links turn
0:14 "That picture frame... those hooded strings..."
I literally had to watch parts of this 3 times because I was laughing so stinking hard!!!
Just to clarify about the necklace as far as I am aware thats a traditional pounamu or greenstone necklace. not a cone. but no shade just pointing it out
That girl is SEXY
🤣🤣🤣
Missed opportunity for "Momo-ish"
Props to Jenna!
Wholesome...
You had me at Rhett Momoa
Link: "I don't know photoshop" Me: *cries in photoshop your memories*
"ahhggwhhaaaa"
Awesome
Jessie does the Chris Evans's chest grab when she laughs lol
One question: where do I get the tshirt?
This is seriously the BEST!!!! I love seeing Jessie without a blurred out face! She is beautiful and seeing her and Rhett together warms my heart ♥️
I’m waiting to hear if my adoption application was approved for a puppy and this is taking my mind off of it.
Rhett in pink looks like he should be in that one pool party scene in Anchorman.
"Aqua man makes man happy." -Rhett
porque ya no suben en el canal buenos y míticos días
I would actually be quite flattered if my wife's celebrity crush looked that much like me.
awww this is really cute
jenna fine asf lowkey
I didn't think this would be as fun as I did 🤣🤣
"make your muscles bigger" im dying XD
This crack me up so much.🤣 This is very sweet!!!💗
I feel so bad for there kids who watch these vids
It’s been awhile I haven’t seen R+L, I’m so happy Jessie was part of a video!
Jenna is the real mvp
I LOVE Jason Momoa and I LOVE this! Rhett, you are an awesome husband!!!
your assistant is hot
Actually i think he looks like Joseph from Far Cry 5.
Rhett is so sweet to do this for his wife. And he looks so great too.
this kinda has unus annus vibes
Please make more vlog content
I've always though Rhett was a hottie and I too am a woman who would want a hall pass w/ Jason Momoa.  Putting  Rhett and Jason together?  OMG, I need a cigarette and a cold shower.  His wife is one lucky gal. Watching this video was hilarious by the way. You guys kill me.
Now I understand why Rhett grew out his hair.
OMG She got on camera?!
This was amazing guys
Homeless man doesn’t know how happiness, wholesome video
Jenna does not get paid nearly enough for the shenanigans they put her through 😂
Link needs to do a Keith urban one 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
https://youtu.be/O_63p35VjYo
When you order Jason Momoa off Wish.
why didnt he just jump into the pool?
I encourage Rhett
If I don’t get a Rhett as a life partner then I don’t want it.
What’s the assistants @
much encouragement for Rhett. This was hilarious
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R09Bxf07_m0
The love between you guys is beyond words😍 Love that you still go above and beyond to make her smile! Happy birthday Jessie😍 thanks for the laughs😂
Kroger Jason Momoa
Alright, but when is Jason gonna come and dress as Rhett?
Alternative title: Jason momoa pretends to be Rhett.
Plot twist, his wife's celebrity hall pass is Link
I think he could more convincingly become Jeff Bridges in "The Big Lebowski" (especially in that pink outfit) but cool project and awesome that she loved it!
HAHAHA THIS IS AMAZING. This pictures came out so GREAT. Also happy VERY late birthday to Jessie!
I looked for a Link as a Keith Urban video...
So my question is why wasn’t this on my recommended last month
WE WANT MORE JENNA
I jus wanna comment.... you had 2 pool/water shots..... && did this all right beside the pool, && use the hose 🤣 think you would have been more comfortable in the pool
I feel like they needed him to twirl for the pink outfit. Momoa’s shirt was billowing out but these were terrific.
Imagine Jason Momoa being a guest on GMM and as a joke, he's in the opening with Link as Rhett while Rhett is in the background going "Let's talk about that" as Momoa.
I have watched this channel for 5 years.. I have never snorted so much in my life. This one never made it in my feed!!! I have been married 18 years....this is so awesome.😂😂💝🥰🥰😂😂😂💕❤️
The dedication of Jenna
I wish they would start doing vlogs more often again. Love this
I love how casual they both are with asking, "When was the last time you were laid?"
15:06 i love how Michael B Jordan is in the back lol
Wow the furst time i see his wife in 10 years lol i thought they would never come on camera
I just want Rhett to roll his shoulders back and sit up straight and he can pull some of these looks off 🤣
Rhett smiling 🌝
Jason is pretty to me too ✋
So sweet!
So funny that the hall passes resemble them.
I feel like this is what would happen if I ordered Jason Momoa on Wish.
Lies .... he paid a hooker to act like his wife
The pink outfit genuinely looked great on him
The jolly dash substantially hurry because party gully brake toward a unruly comma. slow, efficacious spot
His posture is all wrong, he's too slunched and crunched
I think arranging a meeting would be a very bad idea..
If momoa has a less attractive twin I think you got it covered 😬😂 just kidding
Jason Momoa!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Swoon😘😘😘😘😍😍😍
So fun, great work all round. Link's direction was also flawless.
1:42 this is exactly how we men think 😂
Lmao where is your self esteem if you're willing to become someone else to please your partner!
So cute the thats awesome
This Jenna girl is thicc, nice body of hers
Jessie is a lucky woman.
THAT is one of the most romantic things I've ever seen! 💕💖💕 That is one lucky lady!
He looks like Discount Mamoa.
jason momoa has to see this
I love Jason Momoa
12:28 Jenna mhm... looking mighty fine
If you would have trimmed your mustache you could have shown your smile better
I wonder how long Rhett and link have ben friends
I have a big crush on Jenna so you know I love to watch her in the vids🖤. Also do more vlogs please🙏
As soon as he said I'm a marvel guy I liked the video
AAHAHA! Why is this so funny??
Jessie like rhet and link never lost her southern accent
Aqua makes man happy
Tremendous
13:46 this clip without context is pure gold
Thats crazy Jason Momoa came for a photoshoot for you guys!
This video all around great
Bro Jenna is so fire 😍
The hurt in Rhett eyes when Jessie started laughing
That's a lucky woman to have a guy who would do this for her
Would love to see Link as Keith Urban ! Make it happen fellas 💗
More vlogs it’s bin a month and the video before this one it’s 9 months ago
Please post more
Where did you get the paining of with the reds and yellows??? I have that identical painting and it’s definitely hand painted, so what’s up with that??
I really hope they post more often here. I really loved and enjoyed their vlogs
Jenna making stuff the wrong size 😂
"By her"😂😂😂
Rhett's Khal Drogo is if Khal Drogo went vegan for a month
Rhett looks more like Eivor in the thumbnail!
more vlogs plsss
Heeeyy!!! What's up guys?! I'm from Brazil, and I really wanna learn English... So, I'd love to get new American friend... If you want, give me u @ below :)  (I can talk about everything)
Was just watching the Carolina Reaper video. Dear Rhett and Link, I would like to see some of your staff do this challenge. Please!
Used to watch you fellas religiously a few years ago Now I'm back and I'm here to stay lol funny guys haha
my fave part ... Jenna's reaction on 5:58 🤣
i think he looks hot
5:58 😏😋
Omg I laughed so hard. This was awesome! Way to go Rhett!  I love your spirit and humility. If my guy did this for me I’d fall in love all over again. Way to go! I reposted it on my FB so others can watch it and laugh. ❤️
"Aqua makes Men happy" 😂
It would be awesome for JM to watch this and next year make some shots of Momoa in the GMM studio
sweet! lol
He looks like if daniel Bryan became jason mamoa 🤣
Jenna is so freaking beautiful and adorable.
I stopped watching for 6 years and now I see this
😭😭😭I love this
Love this!!
So men are ok with their wives fantasizing about another man 😑
Goodness, I laugh so much, this is a great idea actually
THIS IS THE CUTEST THING I’VE EVER SEEN!!😍😍
Lol
That was so random.
pink fit is the ✨
Nobody asked for this video, yet all needed it
He looks like eivor
these two guys are funny, they should get a talk show
Funny how rhett is probably more famous than jason yet rhetts the one impersonating him lol
everyday im hoping for more rhett and link vlogs
Wowowowowow he actually looks like him though XD sorry Link I'm posting his ego gotta be honest love honesTea XD
Hasn’t your camera man ever heard of role playing? Don’t kink shame him & his wife, dude!
What about a picture of him from Stargate Atlantis?
Keith urban
i missed the vlogs, welcome back (':
😃 amazing! 👏
I think this is my favorite Rhett and Link video I've ever seen,, no homo....
What-did-I-just-watch-at-the-end- “do to me as you please” 🤭
He looks more like floki or Ragnar from vikings
Dat laugh bwo. hAh hAh hAh
Rhett needed to trim the mustache a lot if you wanted more teeth
*"I'm a marvel guy"*  -Link, 2021
The best part is, you both resemble your spouse's hall pass!
PLEASE BRING THIS CHANNEL BACK so thoroughly entertaining
Omg! I ADORE how much she appreciated the book!
Nailed it
I never thought this was something I needed...
Didn't buddy die by pillow? Rip tho
❾ 🅜🅞🅝🅣🅗
Jenna really sounds like Stevie
He's my celebrity crush 😍 Jason is 😋😍🤤🤤
He looks more like a caveman rather than Aquaman :D
"Adjacent Momoa" lmao
The cone was a fishing weight
I laughed throughout this whole video !!! 🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂
How very sweet.Happy belated birthday to your wife,Rhett.
I love this😂😂😂💖 Rhett is definitely white Jason Momoa😂
Happy Belated Jessie....I completely get the Jason Momoa thing ;P
Don’t buy monero, it weakens banks and scares governments
“ Aqua” hahahha I’m dying 🤣 These guys are the best
Rhett is my hall pass ❤️
this vlog just made my day. please tell me there will be more vlogs soon.
Is Jenna single? 😂
Plot twist: Jason Momoa is Dressing up like Rhett too.
Bruh, I ain't even lying but there was a moment in the video where I thought it was Jason Momoa but it was actually Rhett.
Jenna calling it back to Tennessee with her mask! I love it!
I’m so happy to have another vlog, I literally LOVE the vlogs we need moreeee
Rhett looks less stinky the original dud tbh
i dont know about y'all, but i defs want to see more Rhett McMomoa photo's :P
Living the  dream  !
hey Rhett..pssst...she picked Momoa because he looks the most like you.  not hard for her to imagine you as Momoa.  its more about a compliment toward you than the other way round.
Their the cutest
❤❤ The things you do for love ❤❤ Happy B-day, Jessie
He looks like Johnny Mimosa the Walmart version of Jason Mimoa. Its like you had a long day in vegas and this man shows up claming to be Jason Mimoa and everyone goes with it because its vegas.
Now the real question is, will Jason Momoa impersonate famous Rhett photos?
🎉A verrrY verrY Hap Hap Happy Birthday 🥳 Jessie 🎁🎈❤️ Wish you a wonderful day with your very own & one & only Misterrr Mc Mamoa🤗😁❤️
3:12
I think that's the sweetest birthday gift for your wife, not a thirst trap for others made for one person only your wife great gift.
This is funny! I love the questions
Loved it!!! You’re a lucky lady!
How old is your wife ?
I Love Links attitude in this video😂
Colooolor of the wind!!!! 🦨 skunk!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Haven’t seen retts face in forever ,he looks like a dude that lives in a forest
......she pretty much has to...
Rhett in the pink suit looks like he is auditioning to be a cult leader. Also, "Make all of your muscles bigger" could have been the title of this episode.
i need more music content from you beasts
Rhett is my celebrity hall pass 👀❤️
Nothing steals your wife’s spotlight more than a self centered shooting session. Next time get her to be the shooting subject, fierce makeup and haute couture wardrobe, darling. She’s gorgeous.
I'm Link at the end.. his reactions were hilarious.  This was so sweet tho
Rhett: gotta get wet again Link: I got a garden hose
Jason Momoa is nothing compared to Rhett Momoa
Who's hall pass isn't Jason Momoa???? 😍
Ok I need an assistant like that to, assist me
12:02 fat Thor from avengers endgame
Jessie seems super cool. They're great together
Jason Momoa will never be as badass as he was on Stargate Atlantis.
Alt. Title: The Man Mimoa: The Docuseries
Why is link like a therapist an co operator at the same time.
She grips her heart with each photo turn so cute.
This is love! 💘 💘 💘
😂
My mom said your a Matthew-mamoa
Tip from a pro: when someone's smiling, and THEN you count 3, 2, 1.... their smile is not natural anymore.  You play a fun song, you joke around with them, heck- you put on a Jim Gaffigan tape... but you take that sucker the second they smile if you want it to look real!
4:28 MORE COWBELL
🤣🤣🤣
Rhett is a sexy mythical beast
At least these guys made something sorta creative unlike stale gmm.
ohmygod, rhett trying to smile and "be happy" is killing me lololol
I’m encouraging him in the comments
SIMP
I'm encouraging Rhett in the comments
I wish my husband would give me a gift like this!!!! I’m a huge Jason Momoa fan ❤️ you knocked it out of the park! 😂
Rhett becomes a spaghetti noodle with make up on.
They proceeded to make babies
It'd be hilarious if Jason momoa actually saw this.
Cute friendship and love life
THE KINGS ARE BACK
The best gift is made, not bought.
No one :  The seagulls outside my window 0:06
When you order something from the INSTAGRAM :
His wife's demeanour is kind of unsettling 😅
Link: "When was last time you were laid?" ... Rhett: " By her?!?" Ummm concerning reaction lol
The directions lol Link: "Tilt the top of ur head to ur left.." Link: "Now make all your muscles bigger"💪💪💪 Rhett makes sounds like he is pushing out a deuce ha
Why did I read the title as “Rhett becomes Moana for his wife” and instantly thought of Maui when I saw the thumbnail.. oh gosh 😂🥲
Bravo!  This was hilarious
Your fantasy is not working for me. Lol
“Laid by her?” Hahahaha oh my goodness, I was rolling
This is hilariously sweet!
1:21
This is so sweet😍
Hilarious
Sorry rhet you're just not as smokey
You look like Amir Khan the Indian actor. Remake his looks next.
Making these vlogs weekly would complete my life
Maybe Link, Rhett, and Rhett's wife could be a thruple (three person couple)....
Ps: poor assistant. The only one wearing a mask in the room. Poor thing. As long as she’s comfortable I guess.
Jason M would love this video. I’m sure he would be dying of laughter. Nice job!
He's pretty to me too!
Rhett the famous doesn’t have Jason M number I don’t believe it
this was fun all around and I laughed many times but I just love Jessie's reaction - cheers to her for being a great sport and to Rhett (and Link) for making such a cool gift for her (and great job by Jenna and also the mystery crew!)
She is me lmao.  More cow bell! I need more cow bell snl reference  But what she can be given… is me 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🥰 lol To make her want me   We only lay each other yoooooooo lmaoooo
"This isn't about being beautiful, it's about looking like Jason Momoa" MAKE UP YOUR MIND
The comfort of that pink outfit is transcendent😂.
Happy Birthday Jessie! Great job, boys. Was all this in Jenna’s job description? You should probably start figuring out how to make Link look like  Keith Urban, Jenna.  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
So thats why he grew out his hair. That's dedication.
This was a laughtrip video!!!
I am encouraging him in the comments
Hilarious ! Loved this
His wife looks like Anna Paquin!
The Drogo one is the closest lol
Should’ve got a tan
Lol she like momoa more than what she likes u.. Hooka whole
12:57 Yeahh! Go Rhett!
This was hilarious! He's not Jason Momoa, but it was sweet and thoughtful gift for his wife.  I know she appreciated it.
Aw, I was really hoping they were going back to doing vlogs every Saturday. :( Maybe when quarantine's over?
Cant wait for Link's version
Why do you gotta single out Myrtle Beach man? 😂
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Loooove it
This is the best thing I've ever seen. Rhett you win
She’s adorable
I'm gonna encourage him. I used to just have a crush on Momoa, now I have a crush on Rhett too lol
Sending encouragement 😄
3:31 buy my pottery
Jason Momoa and the Wish version is McMomoa. 😂  Links comments are hilarious.
Oh my gosh, I needed to smile like this so bad, this is amazing
10/10
Maker ID mario maker 2 S14-5WS-L4G PLAY MY LEVELS
In thumbnail, he looks like Kaecilius from dr strange
I sooooo love thisssssss 💙💙💙
Omg Jenna’s so cute, she seems super cool
Ooh
The velvet jacket has a Ronnie Dunn lewk.  (Rhett and Link are Southern enough to know who that is.) 😂
That is so sweet. You went to so much trouble for your wife, what a precious, wonderful gift❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
i loved hearing about this on ear biscuits!
The Netflix adaptation:
Lmao Rhett is the definition of out of line!!  Wife: I’m concerned about this cloth you both are wearing  Rhett: yeah it’s hiding something
Chris Hemsworth way better😐
She definitely laid him that night 🤣
No one thought some mousse may make the hair look darker and wet?
Here before 1M Views
Link said "now, mm make all of ur muscles bigger" 😫😫😫😫😫😫😫
I cracked up when Rhett laughed at Keith Urban
😂😂😂😂😂
Next time you should do "Jason Mamoa Becomes Rhett for his wife"
Why did it take a week for this to pop up in my subs when i have all notifications on? YouTube had a stroke again. Happy birthday, Jessie!
Yeeeeee Rhett !!!!! 💖✨✨✨✨ I knew were our favorite 🌟💖✨✨✨✨✨🌸🌺🌸🌺
Dude you need to cash this ban in Aquaman 2 that would be so badass and cool keep it going
That was worth the wait.
I love Jason Momoa and this gift was so thoughtful and funny. Great idea!
🤣😂🤣
Thumbnail:  Trailer vs game graphics
Rhett looks more like a random Skyrim character
I need me a relationship like Rhett and his wife
Sexy! Oops, is that encouragement??.
Do you use SQUATCH SOAP?? Lol...you look crazy cool!!
Wow
Rhett almost looks exactly like mamoa except for the beard if he trimmed it up a little for it then it wouldve been spot on to a T
That lady is fire O.o
Woah his wife on camera?????? Without blurred faces????
f in the chat for the Mac air expert
Rhett was the Spirit Halloween Momoa
This is the most sweetest adorable thing ever!
I lay myself with my hand🤣
bro this is not cute at all . Your wife is deff gonna love this gift though and would switch you for him in a heartbeat if she had the opportunity. You cnt trust these H ORS.   ....
Damn Jenna looking like a whole snack
Y'all did a great job. 😂
Rhett, will you please do the curly girl method/hair routine?
Lame!
Link, shame. I am a Marvel over DC too. But I love DC as well. Marvel is just better in the movie department with character development.
Wait....we finally know the real reason Rhett has been growing out his hair and beard!!!!! Sly ;)
I dont know WHY I Thought that I could watch this without cracking up and waking up my kids....but
Damn link is actually a stellar director 😂 what a guy
Nah I lost it when Rhett was saying Aqua 😂😂
This made my day so much better.
had a smile the entire time watching. omg! so funny!
“Make your muscles bigger” bahaha 10:45
Rhett has more hair on his nipples then I do on my head.
If Rhett worked out more he'd be super hot, he's really got a great base
Omg, Rhett is the perfect husband! Perfect combo of height, body, hair, beard, brains and - after seeing in this video - his HEART! I know getting laid was the objective, but to go to the lengths he did to make her happy, it proves how much he loves her too!
things rich people do
We all know suttin' went down the moment that camera was put down XD
The pic of Rhett in the wet tee is 👌🏼👍🏼🙌🏼👏🏻😍
1. Link, you're his best friend, that's why you're doing it. 2. This is really cool present, haha :)
Didnt think libra Rhett would be married to a Capricorn, but she seems lovely 💗
This was great!
Rhett needed to do some bench presses before the photo shoot. That’s the trick lol
This is the cutest thing ever created
...More Cowbell 😂😂
I lost it at "make all your muscles bigger!" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂 Rhett, " That's all I got"
Well great, now I'm in love with Jenna. Thanks!
oh now he can ! smile ! ! gorgeous)
it's so cute)) and hilarious)))
Bah hahajhahahahhahahahayayqyqy!!!!!!❤
What happened to the vlogs?
When you order Jason Momoa from Wish
That picture frame.
The muscle shirt being wrinkled bothers me SO MUCH  😂
“Aquaaa”😂😂
"Your beads are bigger. Youre compensating for something with the beads" LOL
The vlogs were very missed!
this is so fuckin cute
Hearing them talking about getting laid is awesome lol "More cowbell" it's been awhile since I've seen that SNL skit. 🤣 it is so sweet to see how much Rhett loves his wife!
So he’s a simp?
This is the video I didn’t know I needed.
“Make all your muscles bigger.” 🤣😂🤣😂
“More cowbell!” 🤣😂🤣😂
Hapyy birthday i think we need more vlogs
I love this. Happy birthday.  My hubby let me dress him up as Jack Sparrow for Halloween a few years ago. We were both very happy pirates. This is fun.
Nice
Rhett - This is me encouraging you.  Link - I'm not sorry.
He actually looks more like Wolverine when he was living in the forest 😅
Lmfao you wife wants muscles ...
JENNA'S LAUGH @ 4:00 OMG CUTEST THING EVER
Oh em gee, I've never seen one of the wives before! I feel like I'm invading their privacy. Also my celebrity exception is Bill Hader... so I cannot relate to Jessie. But it is super cute that her celebrity crush looks similar to her hubby.
Jessie is so lucky!!!
These vlogs give me some eerie beginning of quarantine flashbacks
Just my humble opinion, but Rhett is way sexier than Jason Momoa.
🇺🇸 I Have So Much Fun Watching               These Two Guys 🤗 👍Jenna did a great job with wardrobe
Just you two talking makes me really happy so that’s why I sleep while your podcast is playing.. I love you guys
The languid tennis subjectively scrub because jacket marginally compare abaft a petite produce. reflective, vengeful clock
Finally back 😀😀😀😀😀
JESSIE IS THE CUTEST
Please keep doing vlogs
Link is unhappy how Rhett really looks like jason
Sexy ....
Plot twist: Jason Momoa is also Rhett's hall pass.
This is so sweey, odly relatable and kinda weird and cute. Mostly cute.
I love their vlogs so much. They should vlog more
The moldy jar preauricularly mate because bail distinctively coach through a gaudy france. materialistic, stale albatross
They filmed Jessie!
Love this haha, why not vlog this lol
Honestly, this is really sweet. It looked like she enjoyed it, so it was worth it. I'm super looking forward to Links Keith Urban transformation, tho 😁😁
I still get weird vibes.
I really really hope Jason has seen this.
Rhett is daddy asf
The head tilt w the eye contact at 15:18 is THE most adorable thing ever😍😍
"Aquaman.. Aqua makes man happy"  - Rhett
i really hope jason mamoa sees this video and just randomly shows up to the gmm set and says "hey,  im jason mamoa"
That has to be one of the weirdest things an assistant has had to do 😂
Rhett’s that dude that tries too hard.
After rhett did that Charlie Manson thing. That's all I see now haha
His aqua man smile chant is so funny, its like hypnosis
I lick this
Now we know why he's been growing out the hair and beard!!!
What you ordered from the Wish app vs what you got from the Wish app
Someone get Rhett's wife Jason Momoa's number
You did excellent work Link!
13:19   Link: "Don't show me the hole"  Rhett: "That's why I have this towel on"  LOL
What fun! Trimming the mustache and cunning your hair would have made it work better. 😁 Looks great!
Aaaaaaahhhhhaaahaaahhhhgaaaaaahhhhaaaaa
You know, this was a really creative idea, and I'm really glad I got to witness it in the making. Happy late birthday, Jessie!
Rhett's hair is so legendary
I love this more of these
It would be a whole different story for a man to ask his wife to dress up like a woman he had a crush on. 😅🤷🏽‍♂️
His wife is so cute XD
I LAY HER OFTEN LMFAO
Honestly, given the choice between Rhett and Jason Momoa, I'd pick Rhett 10 time out of 10.
Awww, Jessie is so sweet.
I'd love to be looking future husband the way Jessie looks at Rhett. Couple goals.
😂😂😂
whenever that intro comes on I say “that picture frame...”
Tip for next time.  Do push ups to failure before taking the photos,  especially photos of muscles. This is what bodybuilder magazines do
okay so if there are already two Jasons/Rhetts, then there sure as hell should be one for me go damn it
Next we need Link Urban
！？yehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Vlog rhett is so hilarious!!🤣🤣
I know what I’m doing for my boyfriend’s birthday now. Thank you.
Rhett nailed the jason momoa lookalike perfectly
That was truly the best ending to a video I've ever seen. I was smiling the whole time! So happy for Jessie and Rhett :)
Why the long wait?
Actually lookong more like Josh Homme with a manbun and eyeliner.
I’ve missed the vlogs so much 👏
Well they smashed that night lol
"I've got a garden hose"                          --- Link
“Why am I involved?”
My wife wanted to play this game, she said "My pass is Brad PItt, whos yours?" I said: "The cashier at Walmart."
Rhett is way better looking than Momoa. I haven't laughed this hard in 4 years.
Find someone in your life who looks the way Jessie looks at McMomoa.
I have a feeling Jason would laugh his ass off and dig this video
Assasins Creed : Vallhalla  10:17
THE most secure man omg. I love this. I was dying
He just looks like a killer
Hi
Rhetts innuendos are my favorite thing 😂😂😂
You look more like fat thor 😂😂
Damn I missed these!!!
I feel like I just watched something I’m not supposed to see...
Aww the fact that you were willing to be a bootleg jason momoa for her🤧
I seen Jason. Delivered to him. Also drove you Link like 6 years ago when i discovered gmm.
what the heck is a 'celebrity hall pass' i am 23 and i dont know if thats a bad thing that i dont know it
Even with all the teeth Rhett looks like a hobo when smiling xD
Really tears came while watching this video 😂😂😂😅
U guys should do unscripted more often
Link :"I'm a marvel guy!" Me :PPPPEEEEEERRRRRRIIIIIOOOODDDDTTTTTT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  No offense to DC fans
“Horse flesh!”
If they just trimmed Rhett's mustache his teeth would of shown. 😂
I am here to say....Why no vlog today?!
Both Rhett and link have their hot guy days for sure!
12:20, I wish Jason walked into the yard. :P
His stash is too long and covers his smile
Love it!!!  He’s my hall pass too.  Wait, I’m  single!  Anyway, what a perfect gift!!!!!
Can I buy a copy of this picture book? 🤔
This was adorable! I loved it!
So this is why he grew his hair out
Their assistant tho 👀👀🙌🏻
The aryan version is so much better 🤤
Well that was a hell of a stretch. This guy looks like a out of work biker on meth
Someone tweet this to Jason. I would but I don’t have twitter
2013-  Rhet: My hair goes up Link: My hair goes down Add a bit of.. spice 2020/2021-  Link: My hair goes up Rhet: My hair goes down
Video idea. A day in the life of Jenna working for Rhett and Link. I bet that would be fun and interesting!
Jenna has a weird job 😂 can you imagine her with her friends: so today I painted stripes on my boss and wet his tshirt 🤷‍♀️
Oh man 😵
aqua makes man happy 😃
Rhett and Jessie are relationship goals. Also, Jessie certainly has a type; Rhett is the quintessential Mamoa look-alike!
It looks like Jason Momoa is trying to copy rhett
The book was really awesome! Great job. N Happy Birthday Jessie
"This is what they call a wet Mamoa - it's almost like a Mamosa"  Me: ... Me: ...Ma-moist...
Link as the camera man “Okay now just make all your muscles bigger”😂
"There's alot of challenges with this one"   It just never gets old😂
Jessie’s laugh so contagious😂😂😂
Rhett McMoah!
Dude Jessie needs to be on here more often!  She’s a joy and so refreshing to hear, ya know.. besides Rhett.  😂
im so happy vlogs are back! i hope they're here to stay!
This is so entertaining..
Happy Birthday Jesse Hope you have all your birthday wishes coming true
This is pure gold
I love Jessie!! Happy belated birthday
Rhett you look hit and sorry ur wife laughed at you even tho you both look so cute together. Love your personality and wanting to make ur wife happy
ha ha @ now make your muscles bigger
Rhett you look great!
You guys are Awesome..
This was awesome! I'm there with ya on Jason Momoa 🤪🤪🤪🤤🤤🤤
I am 2:36 secs in. It was worth the wait, I assure you.
oh wow you guys are back
Didn’t even realize y’all stopped making vlogs. Just brings back LTAT
does anyone know the socials of Jenna in the video? she looks EXACTLY like me and it’s freaking me out, i want to see what her actual face looks like
I didn’t think I could love these guys any more till I spotted the Low End Theory album in the background. Quality taste 👌🏽
The assistant is hot but she's wearing a mask.
Locke and Shep watching a minute and a half in  👁👄👁
i lol’d with them when link said his wifes hall pass is Keith urban 😭😭🤣
Weird
TBH Rhett looks more like him when he's dressed as Khal LOL🤣 I'll encourage this behavior
Rhett could definitely pull off Keith Urban
When your order Jason Momoa on wish
Rhetts better lookin tbh
2.0
I got too meet him. I couldn't talk!.
You didn't fully commit.. needed a longer sleeve white shirt
She was hoping he would say NO that she doesn't have to keep it!😆
Link is jealous because the only person he looks like is Dana Carvery and no women wants that!
Spoiler Alert @10:10 smh guys
Jason Momoa is my crush and idol. I wish I was married to him😂
So ur wife like his looks and him so u got to change or her lmfao Pusey
This is everything.
Wife: I want Jason Momoa Husband: You have Jason Momoa at home Jason Momoa at home:
This video is pure perfection. Love this
GO RHETT!!! I been subscribed since 2013
Im not really sure why YouTube recommended me this vid, they must have been eavesdropping and heard me say I needed a laugh... So thanks for that. Too cute.
the things one does for love... :D
wait I thought they dont show their wives faces??!?! what changed?!! what did i miss???
Now we need Link as Keith Urban for Christy.
I love this so much.  This is so cute.
This was amazing!😂 Everyone needs a gift with that much effort put into it.
Loved this video.  And baby, Jason Momoa's got nothing on you, well, maybe a little. Ha Ha.  Just reminds me why I love Rhett and Link.  Thanks guys for always being yourselves.
Ha
This is great!🤙
HOLY! They actually managed to get Jason Momoa on GMM! Probs to the GMM crew!
My look alike is Joan Jett which is everybody's crush so blahh 😋😋
😂😂🤣🤣🤣♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️ this is great hahaha I love it!
that was worth the wait
Rhett when he was taking pictures reminds me of Tandy in the last man on earth
Rhett looks like jason in tbe Superbowl commercial
One of best , honest and most refreshing videos I have watched in Months- wow I cannot believe 2021 and there is a pandemic after watching this video. Amazing guys keep them coming😀.
Omg I have the same laugh as his wife😂
Please wear masks
The real reason Rhett grew his hair out
This is art. Nobody can tell me otherwise.
My new favorite video! Need to see Link as Keith urban!
Lowkey looks like a farcy character
Rhett: Who's your wife's celebrity hall pass?   Link: Keith Urban  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂  Me: Chris Hemsworth My Mom: Hugh Jackman (We like the Australians)
LINK just cant be happy that rhett is doing this for his wifes birthday to surprise her, "I dont love what this might be doing for his ego" says the LINK, fucker just stfu and support ur friend instead of being envious of what hes doing for his wife.
BEST CHANNEL EVER
rhett has truly become the California man
Rhett you need to layer, texturize, and thin out  your mop! lol
Huh... Definitely getting southern Jennifer Tilly vibes from Jessie 🤣 Great video you guys are so cute!!!
rhett mclaughlin: my wife likes jason momoa  rhett mcmoa: she wont me
I love Rhett and Link. They both did a great job in this video! Rhett is beautiful as himself and as himself looking like Jason.
Best idea ever
why didn't he just yeet himself in the pool to get wet? missed opportunity.
Well Rhett has the hair and beard.
Me: *stares blearily at my phone screen at four in the morning, wondering if I'm dreaming at ACTUALLY SEEING one of the wives on camera*
Jessie is gorgeous! This is so amazing.
damn i wonder how much they spent to get Jason Momoa on the show
oooh so this is the reason he grew his hair out
Link, don’t be salty 😂
New title: Jason Mamoa recreates his most iconic photos!
Well we all know what happened after this video... 😩 fantasies coming alive that night!!!!
I missed these blogs! yaaaay what a great comeback!
We stan Rhett understanding his wife's love for Jason Momoa and not getting mad. I love that he's supportive.
Lol omg.
I can’t even get my spouse to make me a cup of tea let alone a whole book 🙄
A 2 at 10pm is a 10 at 2am
Rhett is sexier than Jason...just my opinion.
Her laugh is everything!!!!
Aw I loved this! So sweet and hilarious. I need to show my husband to give him ideas haha.
HER REACTION WAS ADORABLE THIS WHOLE THING WAS SO ADORABLE
Links ego fears were the funniest
Sorry Link, this is glorious. I hope Jason Momoa sees this. He's a pretty cool dude from what I've seen in interviews.
I’m dead Rhett thirst trapping his wife
This 💜
we 100% need to see link"s keith Urban
“You said pipe 3 too many times, go change” -Link I died
Nice try guys!!!  🤣🤣🤣    that's clearly just Jason Momoa pretending to be Rhett.
did rhett get an allergic reaction to that paint or something! i could still see some redness where the lines would be!
I can't believe I forgot about Rhett's hair
Awesome video - I loved your wife’s genuine hysterical laughter as she looks through the book. 💕👍🏼🤣
More Volgs PLEASEEEE!!!!
I'd love to have that t shirt
I have missed these SOOOOOOOO MUCH
Lol.....By Her?
Rhett pupussimoa.
Rhett's hair is gorgeous...but use aussie moist shampoo range... for momoa hair!;-)
I need link as Kieth Urban 🤣🤣
This explains so much... Rhett has been trying to look like this guy and that's why he looks like a crazy mountain man
Hall passes are messed up don't try to flip it on someone's security lol
Rhett’s hair is majestic 🖤
I want someone to do this for me! 😭
Horse flesh🤣🤣
So thirsty. 😛😂
I'm so proud of you Rhett for doing this for your wife, to be so vulnerable and exposed for her to play dress up for her. Jessie you're a lucky woman!  I'm proud of you Link for being such a great friend and photographing him for this present.  You guys are so great and I am so happy I discovered you guys during the pandemic lock-down last year. I look forward to continuing to learn all about the Mythical universe and catching up on ten years of it all.
Celebrity hall passes aren't a thing if you live in the LA area and are a minor celebrity yourself. Rhett and link are gonna run into Jason Mamoa playing acoustic guitar with Keith urban and you're f****d
Great job!!!
now you can cut your hair PLEASE
I’m in love with your assistant 😍
Tiny cone!? 🤣 Pounamu!!! Specifically a Toki.
THE VLOGS ARE BACK!!!!!!
bwahahahaha worth it
There is an unexplained part of this story....what’s rhetts hall pass?
MORE COWBELL!!! BUAHAHAHHA i near spat out my water dammit!
Honestly, thoughtful gifts that take effort are the best!  Also, Rhett sounded like the cookie monster when he was trying to speak Dothraki.
was that Jessie in the start of this video?
Jessie sound very much like Teatrunks from Adventure time!
ahh the real reason he grew his hair out!
"you need to be genuinely happy"  Rhett: looks constipated
😂😄😂
Rhett looks like the 144p version and Jason is the 1080p version
I loved this and it was a great way to spend my lunch. Lots or laughs!
Nobody is going to talk about the assistant?
The black make-up around his eyes really worked well with his face. It highlights his blue eyes and disguised his face along with the beard. It worked the most, I'd say.
Jason Momoa needs to see this...
That was worth the wait
I want Jason momoa to see this
Only a little concerned that the rapey character is her "favourite" one...
So now we know EXACTLY WHY Rhett started to grow his hair out about two years ago!
Rhett could honestly pull off that pink outfit on the regular
this was all sorts of amazing, happy birthday jessie! also bless jenna's heart
This is epic
thought Jenna's mask was the TN state flag, googled her extensively bc i am a creep, realized we are both east tennessee born and bred! appalachia friends! :)
Wow
As if Rhett is not already hot.
Well ! This turns out to be really difficult thing to replicate !
It's all fun and games until she accidentally screams his name out🤣
So when is Link gonna become Keith Urban?
If Jason contacted you, would you really let him come over?
Surely using the pool right there would have been much easier than soaking both your body and tshirt with a hose?
Stargate 🤟
"Don't encourage him in the comments" 😂
Omg I love this !!!! Hahahahahahahaahhahaha
Cute
Rhett in pink = your new cult leader
Aww this was so cute, I really like seeing Jessie is the vlogs
Dying the hair would have been the cherry on top I think
Like... is that like spring weather over there? :( Here its -15 minus C
This video was a bit more dirtier than the other ones. Like, Rhett kept saying stuff like " It's coverin' up somethin' ".
Even better than the original Rhett.
Why am I just finding this channel?!!!
Jason Barbacoa
I love this video, it’s funny, it’s amazing, it’s cringey but most of all it’s so nice what you did for her. Make more videos for your vlog channel PLEASE
Rhett has really pretty teeth. Never knew he had teeth in his mouth 😂 I notice this only happens with country boys that have nice teeth. Tim McGraws like this as well. You never see his teeth when he’s talking but when he smiles hit you see they’re very nice. My brothers the same way. Perfect teeth.
happy birthday jessie!  and i was thinking the other day that i saw the resemblance between rhett and jason and then this video came out and i was mind blown
Link is worried about Rhett being a thirst trap and then goes totally shirtless the entire episode of GMM 🙃
Let’s see how well this would go if a man told his wife that Christina Ricci, or Scarlett Johansson was the most beautiful woman in the world and his secret fantasy. Oh, the double standards.
Wahoooo thank you so much for this!!!
*I’m sorry link, but Rhett in the wet beach one was HOT*
That is so nice
"Now laugh."  _"Huh huh hue heh"_
I loved this
Beautiful wife
Someone get a GMM episode with Keith Urban and Jason Momoa co-hosting ASAP
Happy birthday Jessie
I’m not surprised they look so much alike. See, when a person is in love with someone so much, their celebrity crushes tend to resemble their real dating/married partners. So some may think “oh they have a type” and picked that man, but really, your partner is so I love with you, her celebrity crushes are really the ones “trying” to look like you ❤️
Jessie: Hey can we get Jason Momoa? Rhett: No, we have Jason Momoa at home.
I'm just happy they are acknowledging the thirst trap phase of Rhett and link xD
I love their use of Two Steps from Hell in these vlogs
You need to do more material for this channel. Doing projects and real life stuff is more interesting than a variety show loosly themmed arround playing weird party games.
Did she call his pounamu a "cone necklace"? Aight I'm out.
Is Jesse's birthday the 14th cuz me too if so lol
Hello, I've come to encourage Rhett in the comments.
bro their assistant is an udder baddie
Content
This was a pretty hilarious video... but how is Khal Drogo her favorite GoT char when he hardly gets any characterization and literally rapes Daenerys in the beginning? ._.
All he needed was raised eyebrows they are both sexy as hell
Rhett should add the pink outfit to his wardrobe legitimately tho
I literally laughed out loud just at the title of this video so thank you lmao
No one talking about how he showed his wife's face??
Part 2 please! 🤣🤣
🎂🎂
Well now we need Link Urban...
That was cool bro. Looks like she's more into you than the other guy. Girls like gifts you put some thought into.
Your assistant is so damn gorgeous!
@4:37 Rhett looks like the geico caveman 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The boys are back!
Aqua.....     Tofana
Let's do a retake of pictures with Rhett smiling naturally with his eyes, his whole face
I bet Momoa is watching this while eating popcorn
“Aqua makes man happy”
Heck yeah! The gettin got got!
The things we do for our significant others. ❤
Please turn Link into Keith Urban for his wife lol
Honestly I think Rhett looks better than Jason Mamoa
This was Mamoawesome! What a sweet, well planned gift! Rhett and Jessie are adorable!
Great  jod
Jason Momoa has a youtube channel...you're welcome.
This is so lovely
That's was cute....got a bit overtly sexual at the end....but cute.
"I'm a marvel guy" truth.
Rhett looks like he just smoked a blunt
Wet Mamoa. Wet Mimosa.
Horse flesh. Holy crap. I can’t stop my laughing. Happy birthday, Jessie.
omg why is nobody talking abt how drop dead gorgeous jessie is!!
OMFGG 😂😂😂🤣😂😂😂 Thanks for the giggles Absolutely nailed it Rhett 😋😍☺️😚
I didn't know that I needed this video 😉
Damn, that girl's got a beauty booty on her! 12:28
Happy late birthday Jessie!
Am i the only one that finds their assistant hot?
Link is incorrect... Jason Momoa is pretty to everyone. He has such a cheerful energy and is handsome as hell.
"Don't encourage him in the comments, that's all I'm asking!" The comments: 💯🤤😘👍🔥💖😍👀🥳
I actually agree with link on this one, needs more cowbell
..." the hand looks right." L
Link is straight up a woman.
the weird thing about Link's comment at 8:40 is that Rhett is actually taller according to google. so...
This is too frickin’ wholesome!!! 😭✨💖💗💗💗
Link's turn. I always thought you guys should do a Runway walk off.
What my fellow Rhett doesn't know, is that this video will get to Jason Momoa and he'll then be able to.. arrange a meeting ;)
I just finished the video and am still laughing about Keith Urban
I'm dying 😂😂😂
This might be my fav video on the internet
He just looks like a hippy lol
Link: Dont show me the hole. Rhett: “Dont show me the hole.” That’s why I got this towel on.
We love jessie.
Why is y’all assistant so thick
You know he made this a vlog just so he could get Zach to edit the pictures and call it a work thing
turned out so cool! did a great job and drf made me smile
A lot of thirst in those eyes at the end. 😳
As if Jessie weren’t lucky enough to have sexy Rhett, she gets a temporary upgrade to the beautiful, beautiful Momoa. Happy birthday!
Both womens celebrity passes somewhat resemble their husbands.
Love it!!! 😍
Jennas cute ☺️
This is truly so wholesome.
They were gone so long 😭
Sorry but you two are far from manly like almost at the complete oposite side of the manly scale.
Jason Momoa is going to start emailing Jessie any day now Rhett
Her reactions were so wholesome, poor Link tho :D
He looks like Joseph seed 😂😂😂
" now make all your muscles bigger."  llmmaaoooo
Rhett definitely got laid that day.
Momoa after hepatitis...
The GMM Crew must have a blast working with Rhett & Link 😂
You doing great 😎
She absolutely loved it!! What a cute idea 😁
Hi Jennifer
This was awesome!
I just love this
OMG! This is just what I needed. So funny and way to think outside of the box!!
Best thing is ofc that the meme works... Jessie: I want Jason Momoa. Reth: You have Jason Mamoa at home...
"She lays me"😂😂😂😂😂😂 Dead af
I’m dying. Y’all are the best. 😂😂
This was an awesome gift idea!
You're back! 😃
Love this haha
Great idea but I dont look anything like Vince Diesel 😕
12:30 Yo Jenna lookin 👀🥵
"more cow bell" i died, such a great SNL reference link !!
Fantastic work, boys!
"Your hand looks right" 🤣
Okay but that looks like a dragon ball a mask!
Wow, it's uncanny!
just be happy  and you will look like momoa
jessie has the most delightful laugh
2021 Vlog.
His knob totally got slobbed for her birthday lmao 😂🤣
Ohhh is Why Rhett stop cutting his hair and beard.  Well you go and get your role play on Rhett.! 🤣
I want that Keith Urban video.
"now make all your muscles bigger..." 😁🤣🤣🤣
Yeah ok, now have her be Elizabeth Hurley in Bedazzled and see the hypocrisy.
Congratulations on reviving the channel! Nearly a full pregnancy passed since y’all’s last upload!
This was lovely. Link is jelly.
Yeah Rhett looks great, but can we take a moment to recognise how cute and helpful Jenna is 😭
Rhett looks awesome
How lovely is her voice 🥰
Missed the 2 man blogs you guys were doing during the stay at home orders
Link’s comments while they’re doin the pictures is so funny😂
I giggled all the way through Jessie looking through the book. Rhett is very sweet to have done this for her.
9:54 dont know why that was so funny to me😂😂 look at rhetts face
🍑👀
This is amazing! I love it!
This is just a buzz feed quarantine video
Is it just me or does Rhett look more like comic Aquaman than Jason Momoa
Rhett- Help my wife love me! Link- when were u last laid? 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
you guys need to do more vlogs every weekend like you did before covid started. i miss them
HAHAHAHAHAHHAA I LOVE IT
It's pretty sweet that "Make A Wish" let you be a Super Hero for a day.
0:28 Jason where u at :D
“I don’t love what this is might be doing to his ego” 😭😂
So awesome
Just now realizing Rhett sounds like matthew mcconaughey
When you order Jason mamoa from wish.com
Rhett’s curls are GLORIOUS
😂❤️
I can see that Rhett is listening to some high quality hiphop
This is entertaining.. 😆
Dang Rhett packing a ICBM lol
rhet and link think they're slick hiring an assistant shaped like ms incredible and stevie is fine as hell too 😂
This was amazing 😂
I'm curious. What's your hallpass, Rhett?
This made my day. I laughed so hard!!!!
Rhett: Who is your celebrity hall pass?   Link: Uhhh... Keith Urban  Rhett & Link: *laugh maniacally*
This wad this sweetest thing ever. Now Link I want you to do a Jeff Goldbloom set...... please
Definitely worth the wait! Can’t wait for the next one.
Love Rhett with glasses
I wish I could like this more than once. The dedication, the uncanny resemblance, the look on Jessies face, priceless.
stash hair too long, it would have been more accurate if he trimmed it to the top of his lip instead of over the teeth. funny vid though!
That’s amazing!!!!!!!
that "cone" is a pounamu necklace and it's culturally significant so substituting it for a silver cone was odd to say the least
Jenna was the only sexy one at those photo shoots.
"More cowbell!" 🤣🤣🤣
Great value Jason
Killed it with the photos lol
Happy Birthday Jessie!!!
rhett actually really looks like him
0:05  shower time!
There assistant is a cutie
idk why but when link said keith urban i laughed SO HARD
دي^اثة ١٠٠٠
Lmfao this is so funny and quality content i love it!!!!!
I need more cowbell
Let’s take a moment to appreciate the joy of this video and the patience of link
2021: 78, 90
This is too sweet I can’t -
I love this so much 😂 happy birthday jessie
Now Jessie has to do one looking like Rhi Rhi
Lucky you guys actually look similar!
Why would you gift the man of your wife's dreams to her lol. Any competition needs to be systematically eliminated
Happy Birthday Jessie
Rhett Momoa sounds like something highly contagious
This was better than anything on GMM over the past 5 years. Hahaha
none from stargate atlantis, how sad
Well...... umm love it!!! Happy BD to your wonderful beautiful wife !!!
After this video was over, they made whoopee.
Isn't that Tamer Hassan in the thumbnail.?
Ohhhh my Gawd LOVE THISSSSS
yeah, i'm going to need a link to that aquaman shirt
Rhett breaking into 2021 with cosplay Jenna making jewelry for giants
Hahahahaha! xD How fun and creative!
Dude looks nothing like Jason Mamoa. And Jason is far more humble, too.
This was the sweetest thirst trap I’ve ever seen!
that long hair finally coming in handy. just joking I love his long hairstyle.
Rhetts wifey tho ...iim ..annoyed for Rhett  "OMG AAAAAAaaaaha-ha-ha" 🙄 did he let her out for this  Cause I would get that
Tbh the hair and the beard suddenly make sense
Wow your wife is hot
I see that Teema towel! Lol
Alternative title: Rhett being an extremely secure man. ❤  Also, Rhett, you're sexy as hell, but who DOESN'T love Jason Momoa? (Btw, Rhett, you really do remind me of Jason.)  Also also, I was trying to figure out who Jessie reminded me of... Daneel Ackles!
The Khal Drogo is definitely the closest.
Hilarious.
I dont agree with the idea of a "celebrity hall-pass" Besides that, this is hilarious.  And yes, im married, ive been with my husband nearly a decade.
Does he look exactly like Jason Momoa? No. Does he clearly love his wife, or feeding his ego? Yes. Was I entertained and was this a great distraction from the awful state our worlds in? 100%
*AQUA MAKE MAN HAPPY*
Cute x
We've all wanted to spray our boss with cold water now and again.
Get Jason on GMM. XD
Jenna might be the best assistant anyone could ask for
This is so hilarious 💀😭
i'm dying
I'm here to support Rhett being confident in himself.
On this day, we learned that Rhett and Jessie have a healthy love life. For some reason, that makes me happy for their relationship.
i want some jenna in my life
Does Jenna have a CDL for that absolute dump truck?!
um
TempleOS called.     It wants its lead developer back.
The fact that people have hall pass talk shows that they would be unfaithful if the right circumstances came along. Celebrity or not.
Wait...are they vloging again?
“no it’s not about mom  it’s about daddy”  😂😂😂😭😭
Tip: dont put a clip of the video, before the video. Yall fixed it on gmm.
Press F for this simp xD
Happy Birthday Jessie! Way to go Rhett!! :D sorry Link.
"now make all your muscles bigger?"
No thirst or anything here, but Rhett does a lot more for his wife than my fiancé does for me. For many reasons that I have not discussed yet, I feel I have made a mistake. My parents wanted me to marry this guy, I don’t really know how to get out of it.
“Don’t show me the hole” “That’s why I’ve got this towel on” *ignores statement*
Rhett is the Kroger Brand of Jason Momoa. Surprisingly really nice!
So stinking sweet!
Jenna hosing down her boss at 12:41 broke me
can i respecfully request Jenna's IG?
8:48 Never thought anyone would say Rhett wasn’t as big as someone
5:59 so cute how Jenna seems to be blushing at Rhett looking like Aquaman
Accepting applications for a Rhett for my link. All I want in life besides my family is a best friend like this haha (: we don't even need the corporation... Just a best friendship!
Awesome job.
I listened to the podcast before watching this and I just couldn’t wait to see how this actually happened
3:13 I love Rhett’s laugh
This was amazing. I hope you showed your wife this labour of love. Great job guys! And Rhett - for a couple minutes there I thought you WERE Jason Momoa 😁👍
0:07   His wife is wheezing the grubhub ad
I love Jason Mamoa but rhett has much better hair and beard
Im not even done with the video and i love it
Did he really get tanlines from the Khal Drogo lines?
Can we talk about how Link's wife's hall pass is keith urban?
How is nobody talking about how cute/sweet Rhett and Jessie are
Enjoyed this!
They shoulda gotten a fan for the pink picture!
I LOVE the thought and effort behind this gift. What a sweetie!
If Rhett shaped his eyebrows like Jason’s it’s be spot on man!
I loved this video so much!! Your wife’s reaction was amazing!! Thanks for sharing a part of your life ❤️
i wish this video was longer
I love these videos on this channel!
11:15 I think Rhett got a bit of a sunburn when the “tattoos” were still painted on him 😂
I haven’t laughed this much in so long 🤣😭🤣😭🤣
Any one wish he gave her a kiss at the end. Y he do her like that???
Omg I thought it said MEmomoa
They shud have added a little hair in his bread.
Alternate title: Rhett learning to smile with teeth
So reading the thumbnail I was like man, this ain't for his wife, it for him. But now I  have realized he has been trying to become Jason for quite some time now w his bulking up and growing of the hair and beard. This is great man
Rhett is looking more like David Koresh than Jason Mamoa in that pink outfit
What an awesome hubby!
This might be my most favorite GMM related video EVER!! Y'all killed it! Jesse is one lucky lady. This was sweet and hilarious...job well done!!!
I’m convinced this is the only reason Rhett grew his hair and beard out
This is AWEOME! 🤣❤️
10:18 I didn't realize Jason Momoa was the voice of cookie monster
This video made my freaking week!!!
There assistant is very attractive
"I've a secret, I'm Marvel guy"-Dr.Banner turning to Hulk.
Rhett  works out, those pecks and arms don't come free he's hawt 🤷‍♀️
This was worth the wait
I didn’t know I needed thisin my life
He needs to do this again.
this is jason momoas off brand cousin
High key sweet of Rhett to do this!💖💖
I've actually met Jason Momoa and I can confirm that he's as nice as he seems, and he smells great too🤣
Words if Encouragement.....
I appreciate that both their wives clearly have a type
How is this vid not more popular 😱
This was so funny! I laughed the whole time
Happy birthday Jessie! I think it's so sweet how hard Rhett worked to be your fantasy man. This was fantastic, especially the level of discomfort Link was experiencing
Love love love sooooo much fun!
He's not wearing a cone necklace he's wearing a greenstone necklace, I'm sorry my inner Kiwi is getting annoyed
I have never been this entertained by watching a middle-aged man trying to get laid xD
Wait wait wait, you guys broke the rule?? Why now? What prompted this?
Why is Rhett being hosed down when there’s a pool right there....?
How has this been up for three days without me knowing about it???
The hair all makes since now
These vlogs are quickly becoming some of my favorite Rhett & Link content, even over the main show! #LoveIt dudes
I thought there weren't going to be vlogs anymore. I'm so happy to receive this. And it's not even MY birthday.
Wife: I want Jason Momoa. Rhett: We have Jason Momoa at home.  Jason Momoa at home:
Rhett and Link vlogs are great, a lot of originality put in .
... Gold.
I love when they include the wives! Jessie is so pretty and funny! Love it guys!
I feel like if you are married to a celebrity you don't really need a celebrity hall pass for somebody else.
Very far from Jason.  Feel a little embarrassed for this guy
Jessie's hot! You don't need a "Hall Pass" when you're with someone like her.
why do you have to be controlly and judgemental link,and negative... hes doing a nice inttention for his wife.
Jenna seems amazing. Someone needs to get her a ring lol
no way its frankie from the basement yard
Now Momoa should do an episode of GMM as Rhett and have Rhett as the special guest "Momoa"!!!!
Awe that was so sweet
This is what she needed you are going to get devoured son 😎😈😈😈
Poor Link - what an amazing bestie though!
Laid by her? Lol
Wish you guys did this more!
Now she has to become Angelina Jolie.
Can I be Rhett’s hall pass? Lol jk.  😏😏😏😏
That third outfit makes Rhett look like a Wise old hippie that lives up in the mountains. Legends has it you can find him by whispering 'tokyo' to the wind and it will carry back his faint call of inquiry.
Listen man, I’ve kinda reached my limit. Me too. Me too.
I’m so excited vlogs are back
Nice Pirates hat Link and DAMN...that assistant is gorgeous x.x
Omg i love it!!
We He Mamoa?
WAIT when did they start having their wives in videos?!?!!?!?
Hey Rhett Rhett i see what you need to do to make the main look is shampoo and conditioner call mane and tail Herbal (or something like that)Grow it will make your hair long and strong lol btw Y dont ur top and bottom set of teeth touch mine is like that cause i was jumped and my jaw is been broke and cant get it repaired but your videos yall make have me smile every video your biggest fan Aj Downs
Anyone else named Aqua die @7:27 ?
Lucky lady!! Whoo hoo!
you really thought you could just put Jason Momoa in the video and we wouldn't notice
YYYEEEESSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
that was worth the wait!
Amazing!! Such a fun vlog/thirst trap
I can't wait for Link's little lady's birthday
Rhett is not an unattractive guy. He had a bit more weight on him a couple years back, hasn't regained it over covid. Nice job
The way Link choke-laughed a little before he said Keith Urban ^^
The amount of fun and effort that went into this whole process is so cute. He really loves his wife.
More cow bell! I’m dying!
What is the logo for Link's hat? "P"
I think Rhett might actually think he looks like Jason.
Jessie is such a character, I love her.
that just is depressing
I'd love to see Jason Momoa react to this video. I guarantee he would find it funny. He's also a pretty chill guy from what everyone who's worked with him has said. If you contacted him, I'm sure he'd be willing to stop by :)
This. Is. The. Content. I. Need.
Rhetts hot tbh
Awesome, a new upload!
I love this but we also want a Transforming Link into Keith Urban video.
Its like if you ordered jason off wish🤣
Isn't it funny how both wives celebrity crushes are pretty similar to their husband's? Like Link looks like Keith urban and Rhett looks like Jason Mamoa
Missed opportunity to be semi-known as   “Rhett McMoa” Never the less, a great idea and memorable surprise 😊☮️
The real reason Rhett has been growing his hair out
Creepily wholesome AF
Omg. This was sssooooo cute!!!
This is my fav vlog now!!!!!
I'm so glad the vlogs are back
yall know what website you have to go to , to see what happens next LOL
rhet looks like white homeless jason momoa
This is just awesome. ❤️😃
The way Link chuckled before saying Keith Urban 😭
Wish Jason Momoa
I missed vlogs like these
Yup..... EXPLAINS the LONG hair! XD
Am I the only one who had never seen his wife before?
They are back!!!!!!!
I will personally upkeep the remote office pool if I can go swimming whenever I want
LOL sorry Link, He does look just like Jason Momoa Resemblance is to close to ignore!
Now we just need Jason Momoa to photoshop himself as Rhett, in classic Rhett poses!
i NEED a link too that pink outfit !!
We need to see Link as Keith Urban!! Pleeeaaseeee 😂💗
"I'm a Marvel guy"
You know damn well what Rhett and his wife did after the video 😜
how tall is rhett!??
So ready for Link to become Keith Urban!
Literally the ocd soundtrack in the beginning made me so happy😂
@2:25 why aren't Rhett & Link wearing mask? They are definitely within 6 feet of each other and Jenna, and Jenna is wearing a mask. Also, COVID-19 is still growing and present :\ Hmm, I'm surprised.
Horse flesh lol
That was so sweet!!! That would've been a great Valentines 💝 Day gift too  😃
This was great. Happy birthday!
YOU GUYS LET JESSIE BE ON CAMERA?!! YESSS
Link: "More cowbell"  🤭🤭🤭
Keith urban 😂😂😂😂😂
Glad to hear Jessie still has her NC talkin' going.  I'm from Asheville and can hear it!  Great gift.
Huh! So Rhett's wife is on camera finally :O? Wow.
This is hella sweet!
Link reminds me of the father from lampoon 😂
Now I understand why a wife doesn’t care her hubby let himself go!
This was amazing happy birthday jessie
A little less like Jason momoa and a little more like Jethro tull👌
This is what love is 😊
My cheeks hurt from smiling at how sweet and funny this was.
What you order online vs. what you get in the mail
I wwant to see Lin do Keith Urban...
Now I NEED Link as Keith Urban
Amazing
Next video Rhett and Jessie should dress up as Aquaman and Queen Mera
Rhett looks kinda like the Norse answer to Khal Drogo
I love how the assistant wears a mask, but Link and Rhett don't. You see that more and more--- the more "important" people are mask-less, and the ones surrounding them wear masks. Covid-19 or not, we are allowing the government, society to set the standard for us. I don't care if the assistant is "choosing" to wear a mask, it ruined the video for me.
Rhett just needed to trim his mustache shorter. Don't let it pass the border of the lip and boom: smile uncovered. Really builds perspective on how well groomed Jason Momoa is when we see Rhett beside him.
Now that's one wonderful guy to do that for his wife!! I would love to see Jason Mamoa do a photo shoot with Link! I'm sure he would if he knew about this!!!
Horseflesh made me laugh particularly hard.
Lmfao this was so amazinggg I can't wait until the "Link Becomes Keith Urban For His Wife" vlog hahaha
I feel like Link may be a bit jealous...
EGO has been boosted massively 💯💯💯💯
Link is so jealous
Is this why Rhett grew out his hair all this time?
Sorry Link..Rhett is a sweetie for doing this for Jessie.  You are a great best friend for helping to make it happen. Happy birthday Jessie
Great video guys
Loving this 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻 please do more vlogs I miss them so much!!!❤️
Thats how they did that super bowl commercial
This was a thirst video, just not for Rhett. I'm checking out the assistant the entire time.
Ok but Rhett after the picture in the pink outfit with messy hair and glasses? Daddy.
Dang, Jason Momoa looking pretty fine today!
This is adding a new level to their best friendship😂😂😂 -Mercy(Sorry for the name confusion I am using my dad's phone currently)
Rhett tries so hard to look like Jason Momoa but tbh he just looks like a caveman
Pink PJ's Rhett got me all hot and bothered
He was low-key so pissed LOL
rhetts look at the camera at the ends rlly says “mission achieved”
I LOVE THE VLOGS
Bootleg Jason Momoa be like:
When you buy something off wish
Rhett is the Celtic version  of Momoa lol
idk why but i’m rlly stuck on jenna thinking the stone necklace he was wearing was a *metal cone*
10:12 is the creation of meatagen
I love that the vlog channel is back ❤
My girlfriends hall pass used to be Momoa. Now it Rhett as Momoa!
That book is a baby maker! But Alas! Rhett got a vasectomy! 😁
This was so cute , I loved the details he did for his wife(ignoring the fact that this was just a video for him to say he kinda looks like the older, white skinny version of Jason mamoa)
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 I AM DYING!!!
Rhett I hereby encourage you to do more stuff like this!!!😅
Yes I've been waiting for new uploads
A wild Jessie has appeared!   Where’s my poké ball??
This was the cringiest GMM ever. TMI I don't want to know if you are getting laid or who you want to let your wife do. It just came off totally creepy.
The giggles _The GIGGLES_
Looks more like Aivor wolf kissed lol
This is honestly such a cute idea ❤❤❤
Happy Belated Jessie!!! ❤️❤️❤️ this vlog was actually hilarious lmfaooo.
He reminds me of Kratos.
Dont be jealous link... Youre hot in a Linkalicious way
Great Value Jason Momoa
Link is awesome at photography direction
is Jenna single? lol....
Definitely a thirst trap. "You can do to me as you please." LMAO.
Hilarious🤣🤣🤣
"By her??"
Now I want Link to do a Keith Urban version of this so bad
"I got a garden hose" classic
I MISSED THE VLOGS YES
Really thought this was gonna be a calendar.
Wow, what an amazing husband to make this special gift for his wife.
11:20 THE SUNBURN LINES AHAHAHA
If Rhett surprises his wife cosplaying as 11:05 then trust me he is going to enjoy his Lays
Great video lol those were actually pretty close lol.
For curiosity's sake, who else is not attracted to Jason Momoa?
Jessie is so cute! That was such an awesome gift hahaha
Well now she must cosplay as Khaleesi for you 👀
Link: When was the last time you were laid??   Rhett: ....the last time I was laid by Her!?!?!   Ummm.........>_>
HAPPY BIRTHDAY JESSIE!!  🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Jason is a genuine guy who comes home to Iowa regularly to visit his Grandma and family.
Link: You need to be genuinely happy Rhett: *tiniest smile ever*
I'm encouraging Rhett to do whatever he loves this is great!! XD you cant stop me Link :P
This was everything
Now I see that Sheperd looks a lot more like Jessie
HORSE FLESH.
Now I need Link to do this next episode
Okay! I’m so happy y’all are posting on here again (even if it’s just one video) 💚
Happy birthday Jessie!!! Loved this video laughed my ass off!
REAL TALK: Rhett DID look GREAT in that salmon suit and glasses! 😏😏😏😸
Jessie ate him alive after this reveal 😂
i love this but I have to say Link lo key reminds me of Luigi
I’m so glad these are back. Always a delight
Lol I’ve never clicked on something so fast
“Aqua makes man happy”
Imagine if Rhetts kids watched this video 😐😟😳
OMG. IS THIS WHY RHETT HAS BEEN GROWING HIS HAIR OUT?!!!!
More Jenna please! 😍😍😍
Yay!!!   Happy Birthday Jessie! I'm also hoping this means Saturday vlogs are back😃
This is very very sweet and nice and I just want to say, I hope my husband does the same with Harry Potter
This was absolutely the sweetest gift ever!! The love you have for your wife is truly goals 💜💜💜
How ignorant people can be. If a Black man, kill a white person, they are a hero not a criminal. If you are proud to be white you supremacist. But if your proud to be Black, they call you king or queen. This is how you manufacture a NutZI. But hey theres no such group full of Black people that are hating White people who are willing to kill or be violent to prove power, Is there? Keep on praising these people and enable it with your guilt, see what happens. Election is over. Even Democratic Party are blaming BLM/ANTIFA with Trump supporters for "THE CAPITOL takeover". The party is just using y'all for scapegoats. Watch how Sullivan guy in jail. Your a useful idiot and you always find that out when the party forgets about you right after and every election.
Plus 1 for Rhetts ego
Thank goodness for Jessie's birthday because seeing Rhett in the wet t-shirt was the best birthday present I got this year😉😂
I’m sorry but I cannot let Jason momoa to be with my girl she gonna get wriggity-wriggity-wrecked
Link: you know we might be on Rhett: Horseflesh Link: To something
So now we have to campaign for the real Jason Momoa to visit them!!! Thats would be wonderful
Not leaving it as McMoa was a missed opportunity  😂😂
Where can we buy a copy 😂
Pink outfit photo shoot was my fav!
Looks exactly like Jason Momoa if he was a tall lanky hipster geek.
Link should dress up as Dana Carvey. they look exCTLY alike.
This was great. Mission accomplished. It was worth the wait. xD
Oh I'm so happy to have vlogs back!
Rhet smiling is so funny, Im super glad these vlogs are back
Yes... Jason Mamoa is hot, but I'm in 💖 with Roman Reigns 🤤
this is awesome 😂.
there’s no way anyone who is attracted to Link is also attracted to Keith Urban. We have standards a little higher than Keith
Jenna tho. Omg👀🔥
That was honestly so cute.
how is it that i've watched rhett and link since 10 years ago and nowadays they look the exact same just perfectly calibrated and dropped in for 2020. like rhett (pre-momoa) is looking like one of those vegan trainer guys and link is like a coffee dad hipster
Link made this video. The snarky commentary is EVERYTHING!
when you order Jason Momoa from Wish.....
His wife is beautiful! And I love her laugh
Can't help but laugh that they called Jason's Pounamu necklace a cone lol
Keith Urban is such a disappointing answer. What woman is swooning over that?
I have a man like that! He gave  me the best gift...he gave me videos of him lip synching my favorite songs!!! Awesome love!!!
“This is what happens at those wet t shirt contests in myrtle beach man.”
OMG new video ahhhhh
All bow to rhett mamoa
"That goes well, and it happens often."
What a wonderfully thoughtful gift for your wife!
Jenna looking🤩
Rhett did a great job replicating Jason Momoa, let's see Link do Pee Wee Herman
Nice vinyl wall!
Rhett is already the sexiest man on the planet, such a lucky wife!!
5:58 aw Jenna's reaction is adorable
Gorgeen!
If it makes you happy keep making Vlogs!!! I love them.
I didn't ask my boyfriend to do this...
I feel like Rhett grew his hair out specifically for this.
Rhett actually have some quite awesome  hair
I, Jenna, classify as a Jason Momoa expert
Jessie’s accident is everything!! So cute! 🥰
I’m still undecided on whether or not I’m okay with knowing how frequently Rhett and Jessie smoosh booties
"don't encourage him in the comments" 🤣🤣🤣
"Aquaman.. Aqua makes man happy"
This is amazing also Jessie is so beautiful omg
Jessie! happy birthday <3
He played also in baywatch tv show  as a kid to . Lil history on him for u
Aqua makes man happy
How did y’all get Jason mamoa to do a photo shoot to look like Rhett?
That whole section about 'we only lay each other' was comedy gold. Absolutely brilliant!
This is my favourite channel of there’s I wish they uploaded on here more
I have no idea how much Jenna gets paid, but it might be time for a raise
Bro- 🥵
Y’all’s assistant is kinda THICC
This entire video is “what you expect and what you actually get” 😂😂😂😂 I loooove this
Jessie is so cute!! Also, are vlogs back??!? I literally only like Rhett & Link's vlogs lol
Damn this the kinda content I’ve been waiting for
This is so sweet, loving, wholesome mixed with some sexy and our souls need that right now! Thank you for including us for the ride.
That was the cutest thing ever
PLEASE MAKE LINK DRESS UP AS KEITH URBAN FOR CHRISTYS BIRTHDAY
I guess now we really know why Rhett has been growing out his hair.... Jessie is intooooooo that
This is the best
Now you know we need Link and Christy :p
This was so funny omg lol
This is husband goals and friendship goals!
jessie is so breathtakingly gorgeous
The whole reason Rhetts been growing his hair out
Is there a follow-up video of y’all turning Link into Keith Urban? 😂
what in the world was in jenna‘s job description ?
This cured my depression.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Happy birthday 🎂
Omg I've missed thie videos on this channel. I hope they continue to post videos on here.
YEEESSS! Your wife has the BEST taste ever! lol 😁
Link’s meter of tolerance diminished as the video progressed 😂
Hilarious!
I absolutely LOST it at “Keith urban”
Best video ever
I'm encouraging Rhett in the comments
Had me all giddy! That’s a wonderful gift idea! 😂
I love this so much.
This was probably the funniest video you've ever made
Link acting like he doesn't know who Jason is at the beginning. Pffft.
Link needs one of Edward Norton. Cause i feel like he looks like him 🤣🤣🤣
Ok but that pink outfit was amazing on you!
Pretty creepy tbh
Petition to get Jason Mamoa to show up on GMM
I love how thirsty they are for each other still
“Now, make your muscles bigger” this whole video made me giggle
This was hilarious 😂
Love it! Cant imagine when rhett and link will ever become irrelevant
You got to give it to a man who loves his wife enough to look like her crush.
"I got a garden hose..."  Link 2021
Adorable
Rhett is gorgeous and this is most definitely a thirst trap
HAHA the cone necklace is actually pounamu (aka greenstone or jade)
I can't wait to see link as Kieth Urban! This video was well worth the wait!!! Can't wait for more!
This is really cool! 😂👌
these guys are like the mainstream Dickeydines show lmao
Now I know why I had a soft spot for Rhett
wholesome marriage goals
Am i the only one that tried to do every pose while watching the video?
Jason’s hair is darker
The triumphant return
I hope they upload more to this channel
That "i love it" at the end tells no lie !
When you order Jason Mamoa from wish.com
so this is why the long hair nowadays
sweetest woman alive
Rhett you look like someone from skyrim. Either saying curved swords and I was gunna be a soldier but then I got shot in the knee
I don't get hall passes lmao. My husband is possessive with a capital P
I wouldn't NEED a celebrity hall pass if Rhett was my husband. 😭♥️
When Rhett smiled at 4:53 he looked like picture day for a elementary school boy who doesn’t know how to smile naturally
2 minutes in I'm already cracking up 😅oh man I love their friendship Absolute Best Gift Ever 🥰
No my aunt used to do those it was dry when she put it on and the bar guys would soak her in alcohol
Video starts @14:25
Jason is the hottest man alive
Ok this was actually awesome. Really owning yourself like this really turns women on. You really out done yourself. I can see the resemblance. You hair and beard really make it work. I can also see Link as Keith Urban and look forward to that shoot as well.
I demand a link transformation into Keith Urban
Happiest birthday, Jessie! You're the man, Rhett! HAHAHA Love and support from Philippines 🇵🇭❤️✨
Tip for Link: if you want Rhett to truly look happy tell him to think of the McRib sandwich.
omggggg, this made me so happy
My celeb hall pass is Rhett 😅
As if she doesn’t like Jason because he looks like Rhett
Is this why he hasn't cut his hair? Lol
Just realized I just seen his wife's face
I can’t believe I just realized the vlogs we’re back. I’m so excited!
That was worth the wait..
Please bring back Vlogs. This is you guys at your best!
link made me very happy when he said he was a marvel guy <3
Jessie is so pretty! Happy Birthday
Holy cow this was amazing, it was worth the wait for sure.
Rhett definitely got lay after this
Jenna is on my list 👀
Happy birthday Jessie!! My birthday was on the 17th!
Im glad to hear Rhett gets laid often, very vital information for this video lmao
Yk Rhett kinda does look like a dollar store Jason momoa
Awwww! What a gift! ❤❤❤❤
of course rhetts wife likes jason momoa😂
omg i love this channel ❤️
Imagine watching this back as one of rhetts children xD
He looks like a viking.
I want to see a Link version.
Please give us Link as Keith Urban 😂
That is love, trying to make something that your wife will love. And possibly embarrassing yourself in the process.
This was Rhett’s plan all along! That’s why he grew his hair and beard. He did this for his singular purpose of turning into Jason for his wife 😂
That pink outfit gave Rhett a 70s cult leader vibe (jokes aside those glasses look so nice on him)
tbh looking at rhett and then jason mamoa, i can see the similarities that his wife probably likes. it's cute
Keep an eye out for Link Becomes Jason Momoa For His Wife
Bro can’t wait till the new world take control of free speech like this video and your channel
Bro if you didn’t have this channel you wouldn’t have a wife lmao
and we are back folks
Coming Soon: "Link Becomes Kieth Urban!"
This was such a cute idea for a gift~! Can’t wait to see the one when they do Link as Keith Urban 😆
It’s confirmed. Pink is Rhett’s color.
“When was the last time she laid you?”
THANK YOU JESSIE for letting us seeing your reaction!  THE BEST!
This was almost perfect. The only thing missing was Rhett working out for about 5 or 6 years straight. But hey.... close enough. Haha
6:02 idk why I know wasn’t directed at me but just hearing that made me smile LMAO
nice more cowbell reference link
Rhett is MY celebrity hall pass
I like the involvement thank you Rhett
wow they are back
Their assistant though ... 👀
Aqua
Rhett does look a lot like him
I guess Rhett looks like the sad and white version of Jason
There is literally no reason for Jenna to be wearing a mask... my goodness.
Link: Don’t encourage him. Me: Makes a comment and likes the video. XD
I enjoyed this way too much.
is anyone gonna comment how cute they are heehe
More cowbell!
More cowbell More teeth. That’s all the teeth I’ve got. Can we photoshop teeth
I'm thristy!!! This was so worth the wait can not be unseen😍 Happy birthday Jessy
I want you to have Jason Momoa react to this one
Rhett, you are a genius. You and Jessie are lucky to have each other ❤️
Hysterical and heartfelt, nice vid <3
Rhett’s wife has a very specific type and I don’t blame her for it
they need to sell copies of the book on the store site.
Jasons wife's celebrity hallpass is Rhett
Our prays today are for Link that had to take nude pics of his friend.
Where are the guys who do this?  Cause they sure ain't in my city.
barf
I hope to be like Rhett when I figure out who I am as a man. I'm 34 an live in a area where men dont wear pink. Just to have the self awareness an confidence to rock it. That's where I want to be
Rhett: " Then I gotta get wet again" Link: " I got a garden hose"
I love this!!! ❤❤
*encourages
🌯
Totally unexpected from the last one and it definitely was worth the
more cowbell! hahaha thats what i thought when i seen the cone too haha
oh he got some that night ;)
I don’t remember if I commented the day of, but I was so jazzed when I got recommended a video off the Rhett and Link channel that was NEW! :D What a wonderful day
Jessie is soo sweet and wholesome 🥺
Also I kind of wish Jason would see this
No Link, he is pretty to everybody
Rhett looks like eivor
Rhett Mamoa "aqua makes man happy" This video is hilarious
Yes, the video was worth the wait. Don’t make us wait that long again for another R&L vlog to drop!
ENCOURAGE, ENCOURAGE!!!
<3
this video is awesomes
I'm so glad your making these again!!!!
Somebody call the Clevver crew. They do this all the time.
that laugh at the beginning 😂
Aqua make man happy.
now Jessie has to dress up as Rihanna....though i see that being somewhat problematic
I am so freaking happy these are back!
<<<< So Scary
I’m cry laughing in bed. Greatest R&L vid yet.
Lucky lady Mr Rhett ain't no Manoa but he's not bad!
9:42 Just picture this. 1993, alternate reality Waco, Texas. David Koresh has shorter hair, and a beard. Rhett, looks like David Koresh, but with a beard with those glasses on.
I love these videos, why did they stop? 🤗❤
I have to say.  Every wife in the world is now jealous.  How THOUGHTFUL and AMAZING!!!   - Germany...  here and would love my 7 foot husband to do this for me!!!
That was worth the wait!
If Link doesn’t do Keith Urban......
Really guys, how are you gonna be all up in her face with no mask...
We lay OFTEN
SIMP (just joking)
This reminds me of Friends, when Monica is dealing with thinking Chandler is into sharks, except it's me and Link who need to get drunk to deal with it.  Just be yourself Rhett.
And now we know why Rhett grew his hair out.
Awww, this was so nice to watch
And now I love Rhett even more!!
These 2 losers are kringe
I'm. Hot and bothered
Trying to come up with something clever that reminds Link that he played a major role in this and sounds "thirsty", but I can't come up with anything. Fail.  This gave me a much needed smile for the day though.
Link.. Are u a little Jelly because Rhett is hotter then u? XD
So cute
Crazy that Rhett wears his hair down and link wears it up now
Redditors: DO I HEAR A       S I M P?
They are so cute together!
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣that was great 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Such an entertaining video!
Honestly this is some what upsetting dude
hahaha i love the reaction to the book lol
This had me grinning ear to ear the whole time. That was great!
Is no one gonna talk about how freaking beautiful Jessie is???
Ya know Momoa hangs out in Maggie Valley now... right? 🤣🤣🤣😍😍 Freakin love you guys. HAPPIEST BIRTHDAY EVER, MISSUS!! 💜💜
A cone?!  omg guys.  I know you aren't trying to be offensive but he is wearing green stone/pounamu...
I feel like trading hall passes with your spouse isn’t the best idea if you’re famous, the possibility of it happening is less remote.
Rhett growing his hair/beard out is suddenly making sense! Happy Birthday Jessie!
Rhetts been livin on these skreets
😂😂🤣🤣
My heart skipped a beat when I saw a new R+L video was uploaded.  Also, that *was* worth the wait.
I FREAKING LOVE THIS
8:25 she dumb thick
1:41 Link is having none of it. 😆
"By her? . . . Let me clarify" 😂
I’m a GMM fan, but this is the most respect proud thing Rhett has ever done.. Rhett looks like a badass and pleases his wife. Everyone should do a momoa shoot \m/
This was epic!!! Well done boys!
I'm dying x'D x'D x'D
I AM ACTUALLY DYING
Awwww that's just so sweet, you guys... Happy birthday Jessie!  PS. Love the Aquaman shirt!
This was worth the wait
At the end there Rhett was turning on the moves
It's all the teeth i got..  Hahahahahahaha..!!!
Next Link as Keith ,,,please
Giving Jason a run for his money.🤪
I want to see Link’s reaction of the final photos. 😂😂
YOU'RE BACK!!!!!! YAAAAASSSSS
Believe it or not my dad met Jason momoa at a restaurant by his work
I love the effort he made to make his wife laugh and smile on her birthday. This is so cute and the love he has for her is obvious 👏💕
I love ya’ll, but this gave me the worst second hand embarrassment I’ve had all week-
Eh
I think I'm either more attracted to Rhett or less attracted to Jason Momoa...
Why did these videos go missing for 8 months :( these are the best lmao
thats a fast ending
Ayyyy the assistant 😍😍😍
All I could think of with Khal Drogo-Rhett is thats how Meatagain would look/talk
Ok on 3... 1, *snaps on 2*
only disappointment was with the pink outfit, where Jenna or someone didn't hold the end of the jacket to make it look like it was billowing. all in all though, this was top tier!
Love, love, love!
I love Jason Mamoa!!!!!
Why aren't Rhett and Link wearing face masks? That is just disrespectful to the crew, especially when they are right up in their faces, laughing and talking!
“When was the last time you were laid?” “I was laid?...” “Yeah when you were laid.” “By her?” Lmfao I was dying
My wife doesn't get a hall pass nor do I.. that's why we are married! LMAO
I can not stop laughing
Please don’t stop making these collection of vlogs
Sorry, Link, I'm totally encouraging him hahaha. Best vlog every 😂😂😂 Rhett's Jason Momoa's lost twin.
L- "So.... why am I here?.."😂  L-Are you asking me to participate in a thirst trap video? R.- Depends on how thirsty someone is...😂
Why is Jen..... wearing a mask? Even out by the pool. No one else is, and it just feels odd. The girl is super sweet, but it just feels like she's trying to sort of prove a point..
Rhett smiling with teeth. Damn!
link sounded like a hater the whole time, he needed to be more encouraging to his friend....my friends wuld have been all in with helping me with this....ugh, link is a trash friend
Up next, Link as Keith Urban
I feel like Jason Momoa would totally be the kind of celeb who'd be willing the visit the GMM set if they asked him. Once “you know what” is done that is.
This is one of the most romantic gifts anyone could ever get from their significant other amazing photos nice job guys :) Jessie your a lucky lady 😊😊
This is everything I never knew I needed. Also, I now understand that maybe subconsciously Rhett had been trying to make himself more like Jason because he wants to be more appealing to his wife.
His green stone necklace is definitely not a cow bell lmfao!
Bless that assistant and the dedication y'all!
Lol omg teaching Rhett how to smile and be happy is hilarious.
Rhett is the man !!!!
@jasonmamoa
I made a comment before about Rhett growing out his hair for his wife's Jason Momoa fantasy on a season 17 GMM episode. Guess I was right on the money.
8:12 He looks like Klaus from the Umbrella Academy. Also Jessie's laugh is the best. Bless Jenna.
rhett looks like a bee gee in the pink outfit
I love Jessie's laugh 😂😂..I laughed so much too👍👍👍 kudos to GM team for the work👍👍👍
i just hope that one day jason sees this... Happy Birthday Jessie!!
Jessie is so cute...I love her!
Wife: I want Jason Mamoa Me: We Have Jason Mamoa at home Jason Mamoa at home:
This is wholesome..  You're wife is a lucky woman
I can’t tell the difference.
"I Don't love what this is doing for his ego." I- 💀
why does link remind me of a mom trying to get their child to cooperate while taking photos at 5:12
Happy Birthday, Jessie🎂
hahahahahahaha!!!!!!
Missed opportunity—  Rhett: I’m excited for this shot the Mamost;)
VLOGS! This is what I’ve been waiting for!!!!!!!
I know link said not to, but dang that pink outfit photo! 😏🤣
Happy bday to Jessie! We missed these vlogsssss!!
Woah, we never get to see Jessie!!
this is great
Who's she going to become for him?  Ahhh yes, of course.
He’s the Walmart Jason Momoa! 😂
Is it just me or Rhett looks like Eivor from AC Valhalla with that second last shot 11:09
I'm sure you're in a 100% faithful relationship despite of your wife having a sitcom cliche "free pass"
This is the content I didn't know I needed.
Is it safe to call you Rhett Momoa
That was awesome
THIS IS ACES! Nailed it Rhett!
I'm sure I'm not the only one who thought Rhett was attractive until he was side by side with Jason Momoa.
I love that Rhett is getting sprayed by a hose next to a pool 😂
i bet alot of mail got sorted that night! lol HBD jessie!
Well, this is sad ...
if there was a walmart version of Jason Momoa, this is what it would look like
Honesty not a bad look. Keep the long hair
Rhett has Botox and that’s why he can’t move his upper lip
Jenna Purdy. Me likey Purdy Jenna 😍.
Rhett,  this video is great!  You're pictures are awesome & you really achieved the Jason Mamoa  look!!
OMG Rhett, you in pink is working for me 😉
10:56 *random caveman noises* “it means I’m getting tired” 😂
Lmao when Link said Keith Urban 💀
I just want to ask...shouldn’t your husband be the most sexist man in the world to you?” Ijs 🤷🏾‍♀️
This is an amazing video
10:00 LMFAO
I am so happy these two are back to doing their vlogs!!! It’s been so long and I’ve missed this side of them so much! Love you guys and keep up the wonderful content!!
Jenna is cute as hell!
I’m going to have my husband do this for me —but of Rhett dressed as Jason.
Imagine being their neighbor lol
I really enjoy you guys on this channel. I like seeing you too out in the wind and out of the studio.
finally another video on this channel!
jessie’s so pretty 🥺🥺
Jenna outdid herself with the styling!
I feel like Rhett can have a whole career as a Jason Mamoa impersonator
Rhett's long Hair phase makes so much sense now! Haha
This 8s the sweetest thing ever! Extra brownie points for you. I hope one day my boyfriend of 10 years does something like this
Totally works, totally looks like Jason Momoa
Shave the beards, Jason is still hot. Just sayin The ego on this guy.
Now, I know they've got some resources available, but how did they get Jason M. To sit next to Rhetts wife while she received her gift?!
Ohhh, so THATS why Rhett is growing his hair out....
Finally! Let’s gooooooo!
Cracks me up how upset Link is🤣🤣🤣🤣 Love him
ha. This is awesome
That look right at the end: "We gonna fu-"
Her reactions made me laugh so much lol
No bday kiss !???! I’m upset
Awesome job! I think his wife appreciates him more than he thinks! You can tell she loves him! Cute birthday gift for his wife! Love it!
This is my fave Rhett & Link video, ever. Happy Birthday, Jessie!!!  Speaking of Game of Thrones, Rhett also reminds me of Tormund Giantsbane. Can't waith for Link's Keith Urban version.
Surprisingly entertaining lol 😂
I laughed so hard this is brilliant. LINK NEXT PLEASE
I just want to watch Jessie decorate a house. That’s all I ask.
Can we acknowledge Jenna effort🥵
This is like the nicest thing a husband (who's wife has the hots for Jason Momoa) could do for his wife.
It’s like someone ordered Jason Mamoa from Wish, I love it lmao 😂
2:17 Rhett: "Depends on how thirsty somebody is." Link: looks in camera 🤣🤣🤣 Trending 42
The book was hilarious and sweet at the same time
This was one of their best Vlogs yet!! I've watched it 3 times and laughed so much!
That was actually adorable
If you're wife don't put out time to get rid of her
Please more Vlogs !!!!!
Me and my boyfriend watched this together and now he has an idea for my birthday now. I wonder what it is lol. Happy birthday Jessie
Dude you need to stop doing things for your wife, let her adore you not the other way around, be an alpha male, she will love you better
We gotta get Rhett swole!
Happy birthday Jess!! Interesting bringing this together Rhett. 👍🏼
Link: Don't encourage him Link 10 seconds later: *gives directions on pulling shirt lower* Yeah yeah yeah
He looks more like cricket from always sunny in philadelphia
#relationshipgoals
Rhett is a beautiful man.
That velvet coat tho 🙌🏻
Getting Link to look like Keith Urban would mostly be giving him his old hair style lmao.
Jessie’s reactions were so adorable 😂
Find you a person who looks at you the way Rhett and Jessie look at each other.
If Jason Momoa and Rhett Mclaughlin are your  choises, you have right taste in men. Happy birthday Jessie!
Well he didn’t but it’s adorable that he tried to. It shows that he cares.
I loved every second of this
This is amazing #husbandgoals
I love Jessie!
I want a Rhett in my life
That assistant doe 🥴🥴🥴
Cutest gift ever ♥
This was so sweet!
I thought Link was going to be dressed as Daenerys : (
....................REPENT YE: FOR THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN IS AT HAND.......................
I missed the Rhett and Link vlogs so much 😭
Toooooo funny!!! Love it!!!
YES THEY'RE BACK!
You guys are my all-time favorite creators.
PLEASE turn link into keith urban for christy
Jessie is amazing!! 💜
I love that Rhett is secure enough in who he is to do this for his wife. 💖 Real love. 💖
Jenna has an attractive personality that matches her looks.
How long ago was this made? His hair is even longer and more Momoa like now.
Call him Jason Samoa  like the cookie
Keith Urban!!?! 😂😂😂
Definitely worth the wait!
ooooooh we actually get to see one of the wives?!?!  😯😯😯   * EDIT:  oml thank you for uploading this video!!!  😂😂😂👍
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates♥️
Nonsense
12:54 I'm so glad we were involved in this.
Someone contact Jason Momoa and get him to meet Jessie
Awe this is so cute ❤️
his aquaman laugh sounds like cody ko hahahah
5:59 Ok that was cute
When you order Jason Mamoa off Wish.
This was amazing! Ok,  now we need the " Rhett as Keith Urban" photo layout! We are waiting.
rhett should have got a flipper to wear like the toddlers in tiaras! better than link teeth shaming him the whole time lol.
Lmao
I love this and you guys should definitely make one for Christie too
Poor Link 😂
KEITH URBAN 😭😭
I learned 2 things from this video. 1. What inspired Rhett’s hair and beard. 2. Link was a yearbook photographer in a past life
We got Jessie's face on camera now, what about Christy?
Happy Birthday Jessie!!!!😀😄❤️🙏🏻😇👏🏻✌🏻🎉⛪️🎂🍰👆🏻.
Omg this one was v funny
Someone with twitter send this to Jason Mamoa 😂😂😂
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am32DtzfkcE&t=9s
WE NEED TO SEE LINKS THIRST TRAP VIDEO FOR CHRISTY!
Link said, "now make your muscles bigger"  🤣🤣🤣🤣
Well, now we know why Rhett has been letting his hair grow!
I love how different this channel is from GMM
Not bad Rhett, but still think you more resemble Encino Man (Brendon Frazier)
What a great idea! Rhett's wife looks very happy!
This is what I want for my birthday. My man making as much if not more effort!
lmao i love jason momoa!! hottest man alive!!
So romantic! Love it
YAYYYYY!!!! The vlogs are back! I love dorking around with you two on the weekend.  Also, happy birthday, Jessie!!
When you needed to smile today.
The pink outfit pose with the glasses make him look like David Koresh
This was the best thing ever 😂😂😂👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
12:43 I agree with Link
She doesnt want the costume, she wants the masculine demeanor and the physique, neither of which you have.
Link's level of uncomfortableness during this entire process makes it 100% worth it. Also, I love Jessie's reaction to it. <3
Rhett looks like Zach Galifianakis with that smile 😂
So this is why Rhett has been growing his hair
You cool and sweet
And
I like you
I love you man
"Tilt your head to the left... ok, now, make all your muscles bigger..."  lmao
Thank you guys! You totally made my day , you lifted my spirits when I was down in the dumps. Happy Birthday Jessie! Stay safe all
It's the Link blatant ✨toxic masculinity✨ for me...
Does anyone else think that Jessie’s reaction is so wholesome and literally the most adorable thing???
Im in love with your assistant 😍 💕
This is so great hahahahah
ABOUT TIME y’all upload another vlog 😔
I’m so glad we got another video on this channel!!!  Yay!!!🤩🤩🤩
I just put this together, RL is Rhett and Link but it's also Real Life.
She had a harry potter tattoo!! Sorry Rhett but us potterheads catch those things lol
The thumbnail of this video is as follows: To the left, a man that looks angry and could snap at any moment and snap your neck, to the right a man that just saw someone use their finger to taste test the potato salad at a Golden Corral
No one cares get off the internet
The Wish version of Jason Mamoa
Jen is the ilder version if Amanda Cenry
What a man
I cackled at the "The Beads are, you're compensating with the beads" and the massive cone pendant too 😭😭
I really dig that Tennessee mask she's wearing!
LOVE THIS!
Welp looks like im gonna do this for my wife
Wooow pretty impressive 😅😁😁
DC FOREVER! Marvel was cool until Disney bought it.
me: mom can we have jason momoa? mom: no we have jason momoa at home jason momoa at home: 6:22
Lmao this was great 👍🏻 hope I find that type of love one day
Yesss bring these vlogs back I loved them
So happy these are back!
As always since Link is not the center of attention in this video, he's not enjoying himself.
I cannot wait for the Link / Keith Urban shoot.
I knew He was growing his hair out for a reason
Awwwwww
Thank You - oh guys this is awesome!, bay city, oregon
a beautiful concept to be the fist video of the year! Now I wanna see link as keith urban tho!!!
The hose used in this video was clearly not Rhett's, because he modified his to dispense nacho cheese.
This guy looks like he can rock a GOW Baldur cosplay.
Yeah, this is what someone whose gonna die alone wants to watch.
Omg you’re wife is so adorable ☺️ I love her laugh 😆  Happy Birthday Jessie 🥳 This was a great video ♥️
They really went from Rhett and Link to Wet and Link
I don’t think that he has become this for his wife - more like desperately for his audience.
Have not met Rhett, but I have met Jason Momoa and the guy is a giant! Standing beside him made me look like a child. I’m 5’3”.
This is a beautiful gift for a loved one
Rhett McLaughlin is my hall pass... I’m not married, but if I was he’d be mine
This was a gift for his wife but ended up being a gift for us too lmao hillarious but they did a great job.   Happy birthday Jessie
Rhett looks like in porn version of game of thrones.
Lol Rhett has tan lines on his chest
Link has 2 do Keith urban
How do I hire Link for photoshoots?? I NEED a self esteem boost
They both kinda their wives celebrity crush 😂
Rhett is Tom Kenny mixed with Jason momoa
The best every I need my boyfriend to do this lol
More vlogs please! I miss these
Bro, you have to dye your hair and beard to look like him in Game of Thrones
This was brilliant! Also, Jessie rocks!! I lover her sense of humor :)
So am I the only one who absolutely despises "CeLeBrItY cRuShEs" in relationships?? Like how on earth is it any different than consistently talking about railing some stranger on the street? The intent is still there of longing after someone else... what does them being s celebrity change?
I missed the vlog so much.
I didn’t realize how much Rhett looks like Jason Mamoa!
that's a brilliant present!
Seems weird.
*imagines link as Keith urban*
This is the cutest video you ever made  💯
That young lady is protecting you with her mask. Why aren't you protecting her?
Is it just me, or does Link remind you of Justin Hammer from Iron Man 2?
i think she likes jason momoa because he looks like you:D
Thank goodness the vlog is back!!!!!
"that goes well and it happens often" that is the most respectful way of talking about that kind of thing. loves it.
"Can we photoshop teeth?" "That's not my department."  I dunno why this is so funny to me
That is awesome! Happy Birthday Jessie!
I really don't want to feel sexually attracted to Rhett but here I am.
Wow I need to get my husband to do this. Role play hunny?🤣
It's always worth the wait 😀
OooooK now I understand why Rhetts Godly Perfect Hair has been grown out, I must say it was worth it 😀
I Always Said If Rhett Slowly Got Really Brolic Over Time Along With The Hair Growth The World Wouldn’t Know What To Do 😂
The whole video is gold... but the interaction between you and Jesse when you give her the book is the best part. Wholesome! 😊
"Can I keep it?" So cute
Use to like Jason. Then he come to my hometown to the bar. He ran up a 300$ tab, tipped 5$. Also made the bartender stand there in a busy bar waiting for Jason to finish his story to his friend. Just lost a lil respect for the guy. No need to be rude
This is awesome happy birthday!
This is the comment to not* encourage Rhett  *very much
Oh, I hope you know that we will want to see Link as Keith Urban now with Christie on camera as well :D
I love Rhett's wife, she's hilarious and smart
Definitely click bait, definitely worth it!   Link: Keith Urban Rhett: laughs because he doesn't have to be him Us: there better be a video of that coming soon!
rhett should have dressed like tormund lol
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you for sharing this! Was having a bad morning until I watched this. I'm perfectly happy now. Happy birthday Jessie!
Rhett’s beard is iconic at this point
Jenna appreciation comment!! She’s the best, we love Jenna ❤️
Link :''Dont encourage him in the comments'' Me: '' I am definitly encouraging this ;-) ''  Jessie : '' i know you dont mind, cause you are secured'' AWhhhhh That just melted my heart, she is so amazing   Love you guys , this video made me laugh a lot  KEep up the great work !
I think that was the best,and cutest thing I have ever seen!!! Love you guys!! And big thank you to link for being the best friend in the world!!!
Yessss!!!
Jessie's reaction was the best 😁
So THIS is why Rhett's been growing out the hair and beard
Missing one touch..... Jason thought people with broken noses looked cool so his friend was like OK and broke his nose......
More videos like this please
Ayo how’d they get Jason Momoa to do a photo shoot with them?
Didn't think the wives were supposed to be on camera?
Great gift, loved the video. Happy Birthday! Thx&see ya😁
Can't wait to see Link turned into Keith Urban
Aqua makes man happy. 😂😂😂
9:40 😱 best suit for these kind of glasses EVER!!! how come men get better looking with age and women just get saggy
watching this twice cause ive missed the vlogs
This made me week. Your vlogs are the best
The title alone is one of the most Caucasian things I’ve seen, EVER.
Rhett: do I look right? Link: Your hand looks right.
Yir! finally a new upload!
If we had some face tape up in here, McLaughlin’s brows could have gone from — to / reeeeal fast 😦
Ok but when is Link gonna turn into Keith Urban???? 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Jenna is absolute fire, jeez o pete
Link: “you need to be genuinely happy” Rhett: 😐
THAT WAS SO SICK DUDE! Not really my type, but you did AMAZING! 💯
It’s very cute that both of their wives’ celebrity crushes have the same energy as their husbands
Oooff you guys should have just stayed away forever... it was better.   This was absolute trash
OMG, THESE ARE BACK! Happy birthday Jessie :)
kinda pulling it off ngl 👀
The pink outfit on Rhett 😍
This is us officially encouraging Rhett to continue this journey.
With all that laying talk i think we all know what happened after the shooting of that last segment
"Jason momoa" has never looked better....the real one is so not my type 🤣
If I have to kill someone for a Link x Keith Urban photoshoot I will.
Wow. You fulfilled your wife’s fantasy by dressing up like the man your wife lusts over?
I quit my work with the help of 𝐟𝐮𝐧𝐝𝐚𝐢𝐥𝐲𝐩𝐚𝐲 .𝐜𝐨 𝐦  #awesome 0:61
Did Link also get a book? ;)
Honestly with the teeth problem. You just need to trim the mustache. The last 3 pics was pretty great
What happened to the GMM rule of hiding the wives faces? Is there some context to the change? Like on their podcast
What a simp
Jenna is the real MVP
I need someone to show Jason Momoa this immediately
Rhett looks like a homeless person smiling 😂
Are they gonna start doing vlogs again?
It’s a green stone necklace not cone
Aqua does make man happy, though.. #GreenNewDeal etc..
"I can't be happy like this.."
I always thought Rhett was attractive...until he compared himself to Jason.
Jessie and Rhett are such a beautiful couple. Happy birthday Jessie! ❤️
The woman is wearing a mask widepeepohappy
Awe Happy Birthday Jessie
The real reason Rhett’s been growing out his hair and beard.
I LOVE the shirt of tats!!! It looks Awesome!!!
Get yourself someone who does this for you and makes you laugh like this. If he doesn’t, throw the whole person away, just saying
Omg FINALLY you guys post !
I missed the vlogsssssss😭😭
OK, for real, I laughed more watching this than I have for any GMM episode… Not because I thought it was ridiculous, but because I got genuine delight out of the whole scenario and the execution of all the photos. This was gold, guys, such a great idea!! 😂😂😂  And quite frankly, Rhett, you can pull off the Jason Momoa thing. Jessie most definitely has a type, hehe 😉
So I literally checked yesterday to just see how long it has been since a vlog was posted.
Lmaoo I love this 😭🤣 happy birthday ❤️
I feel like Jason really needs to see this. If I ever meet him I’m showing him this
idk link i feel like they do look a lot alike. if rhett worked out everyday and ate like a movie star on a strict diet i’m sure they’d be considered doppelgängers
No we know why he grew his beard and hair out 😭😂😂😂
She still has a southern accent
Aw This video is trending
So glad to see that the vlogs are back! This one's high quality
Now this is the "Youtube Married Couples" content I fully endorse.
Mom come pick me up, I'm scared.
Happy birthday Jessie
I hope jenna gets paid a lot lolol
The fact that Link is a marvel guy makes me so happy. 😭 So proud i could cry!
Welcome back to vlogging!
Link- Don’t show me the hole ( ͠° ͟ʖ ͡°) Rhett- that’s why I got this towel on ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Their relationship is super cute :)
Heck yeah go Rhett. Happy birthday Jessie!
She’s a lucky woman ☺️😝😍
Rhett: “Jason Momoa” Link: 👁👄👁
300000th view
WOAH since when are we showing the wives unblurred?????? I felt like I was breaking a rule just by looking at her 😂
This is relationship goals right there!
Jenna was looking fine... oooo fine! She’s pretty to me!
This was unexpected and amazing.
Jenna is really cute
More of this goodness in the world. YES!
Just so ya know the cone or cowbell is actually a greenstone
Aweee
Cucky
How was this both wholesome and cursed at the same time?
I once walked around a corner and almost ran right into Jason Mamoa, I had no idea who he was at the time though so I just apologized and kept walking
dude why did i now know about this sooner???????? YO
Rhett would arrange a meeting for his wife and her celebrity hall pass?  Geez, why did he get married?  I think his wife is kind of insensitive to say some other man is the sexiest man on the planet.
Happy birthday, Jessie.  I hope you enjoyed your thirst trap.
Thanks guys
Lucky man ! Jessie will love you forever xx
That's a great gift. Some of those photos turned out uncanny to the originals ;)
1:41 What we're all thinking when both of them were discussing when did Rhett and his wife lay each other
THIS VIDEO WAS UNEXPECTED BUT NOT UNWELCOME
Get Jason to do a episode on GMM!
Awww! This is so sweet!
In the thumbnail I thought Rhett was a video game mod or some sort of video game thing. Honestly incredible how far technology is!
Yes, teach us love. Aw!
Petition for Link todo Keith Urban now
Link: "Ok... When was the last time you were laid?" LMAOOOOOO LOST IT
Could not stop laughing. Amazing!!!
Jenna Needs a Raise 🗣 Well Done 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
love this..
Ok, but the pink outfit looks like it could be straight out of Buddy System 2
She’s beautiful!!!
*A Q U A M A K E S M A N H A P P Y*
so ready for this vid
The things a man does for a woman
Well worth the wait! Great vlog!!! And happy birthday fellow Capricorn (mine is 1/14)You’re so cute! Great job Rhett! Best. Husband. Ever!!!
This was funny 😂 as a fellow Rhett I approve
I want a Jason Momoa reaction video
Bargaimoa
Gosh it's been so long since a post on this channel (which is my favorite by the way)
I'd be willing to bet Rhett kept the aquaman shirt. For reasons.
Happy Birthday Jessie!!! Also, so happy for a vlog video!!!
“More cowbell” Most under appreciated line  Shoutout to Christopher Walken
THE VLOGS ARE BACK! IM SO HAPPY!
DUDE ITS BEEN 8 MONTHS SINCE THE LAST VLOG, HEY!
That... that was worth the wait! 😂😂😂
I loved this
Plot twist: now Rhett is going to shave all his hair and facial hair
And here we see the actual reason Rhett grew his hair out.
Should have trimmed the facial hair around your lips, it would have shown your teeth and lips more, like Jason. And, arch your eyebrows with a little eyebrow pencil, to make them look a little pointier.
Pretty sure this video shows that much like with Stevie, Jenna is an integral part of making Rhett & Link be Rhett & Link.
He go pretty close
We're still thinking it. Jenna is 😍😍😍😍
This is what "Rhet & Link" and "Ear Biscuits" should be!!!!  An Adult look into Ya'lls inner thinkings and thoughts  I love GMM but the Lost Years Series on Ear Biscuits and stuff like this is my favorite.  We Watch GMM and More as a family daily, but I listen to Ear Biscuits to work (Murrieta to 32nd Street San Diego on the regular)   Please forigve any misspellings for I have had Bourbon tonight.
“do i get to keep these?” rhett: 👁👄👁
An Honest Try...but you aren't an authentic Momoa.
Link with his director's hat is everything 😂😂
Omg his wife is beautiful 😍 😲
Best video ever. Rhett is very handsome and Jessie is very much loved. Poor Link. Great video guys.
Omg. This is the best thing and so sweet.  If my husband did this for me I would be floored, no matter the outcome.
0:26 did he say he would let Jay pwn his women ?
“MORE TEETH!”
keith urban im fuckin dead
I'm so happy to see the vlog come back :D
This is weirdly wholesome and I love it
Worth it!
This is the video I did not know I need in my life! 🤣🤣🤣
Jenna deserves a raise
I love this
I love seeing link bully Rhett lol
My friends name is link and he bit me lol
i’ve never seen Rhett’s wife before. she’s beautiful
Hilarity aside, this is actually a pretty sweet gift 😜
I love this! I love you guys! I miss the vlogs! Great video! And wow Rhett is a lucky guy.
Now we find out the real reason that Rhett has been growing his hair and beard.
“Are you asking me to participate in a thirst trap video?” 😂
Omg now I know who Rhett looks homeless now! Such a sweet heartwarming pay off
One of my absolute favorite vlogs! Loved every minute😂 I love that you guys have been together so long and you still go to these lengths to make her laugh and feel the love you have for her😍 you guys freaking rock❤
Did the paint like burn Rhett???? It left marks.
beautiful human beings
I want Jason Momoa to see these and come on GMM at some point (when COVID is over) and then bring Jessie in for a GMMore episode or have a video of her meeting Jason Momoa for the Mythical Society.
Rhett looks better than Momoa according to some
Interesting how Link and Rhett don’t need to wear masks. Thumbs down 👎
Rhett: "Aquaman?" Link: "... I'm a marvel guy."
Happy Birthday Jessie! That was an awesome project 👍😂 Will you still love Rhett tomorrow knowing he posted this on YouTube? lol! Love all of you and I hope it was all worth it 🥰😎
Rhett and Jason have never been seen in the same room together, which makes you wonder...
I loved this too much
This is the best possible way the vlogs could've come back
Okay but Link’s directing skills!! 👏 👏 👏
What a success! This birthday gift certainly won’t go forgotten! In all seriousness, Rhett, you did well!
this was worth the wait
TODAY IS MY BIRTHDAY TOO!
More than anything, I'm happy that this channel is back!
And Rhett’s my “Celebrity freebie” 😉
NOW it all makes sense why I’ve always found Rhett sexy!! Rhett and Jason could be brothers! Damn.... he’s got a lucky wife!
Rhett:"Aquaaaaaa makes man happy" Me: *starts hysterically laughing*  Edit: wow ive never gotten this many likes on a comment before!!! Thanks!
How long did he have those paint markings on? It looked like he had actual tan lines from them in the next scene!
this is just sweet and adorable.
I was literally just thinking in the shower today that I missed the vlogs then I saw they posted a vlog. 😮
AQUA !!! lmmmaooo
LOL @ this whole thing 😆😆😆😆
Those jeans were MADE for her 🥵
I laughed so hard I cried at the end haha amazing vlog
This is the greatest video you guys have ever made. You can retire from internetainment, you have reached the top!
How much did it cost to get Jason to come do a photo shoot?
Omg 26th on trending!?!?!?
I like how she said do i get to keep this
I want the verb laid to be replaced with “sorting mail” from now on
NEW VLOG !!!! best day ever ty
lol Jessie's reaction reading the book is incredible
Okay I need to see link as Keith urban
Yes new episode ... thanks for uploading we love these vlogs
🤣🤣🤣🤣
I thought you were dressed up as Alex Thorne from task master dressed up as Jason Mamoa...
Also tell Jenna I said HHHEEEEYYY 😎
Jessie has such a great smile and energy to her. Happy Birthday Jessie!
Jenna. Your not engaged. Will you marry me?
Mindblown when I found out that Rhett is actually TALLER than Jason Momoa
Getting off work and seeing that they have brought the vlog back makes me feel like a made 10x more in tips tonight !!!!! Omg so mutha flippin happy
At least we all know somebody is getting laid tonight...
OMG A VLOG YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
I hope Rhett kept the khal drogo outfit!
This is the funniest thing I have seen in a very long time. I watch GMM regularly, but this is just beyond... Also, thank-you to Jessie for being on camera to complete the story. I hope she had a great birthday with Mr. McMomoa.
Miss Jessie Lane 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Oh great , now there are two douchebags
Best video ever lol
Best Rhett and link vlog ever!!! Omg jessie is so cute and sweet
All the Rona in LA County and you guys don’t wear masks around your employees?
Don’t make me wait for this long ever again. Happy birthday Jessie!
We are PARCHED
Gross
A VLOG HOLY CRAP YES
What a pleasant surprise 😄
Sleep now n the fire
I missed this! So much better than G.M.M.
Love this stuff more than Gmm. My favorite was looking for the rat in links house:)
This... this is art..
Yes
all jokes aside, this is so wholesome.
Omg...finally the queen on the channel
What a perfect way to come back with the vlogs 😆
Honestly her reaction could have been the whole video and that would have been amazing. This is so sweet, she is so amazingly gorgeous and he is so sweet.
YESSIR ALWAYS APPRECIATE A SURPRISE VLOG
Epic!!  Friggen loved it!!
Happy Birthday Jessie!! Your birthday & my bf birthday are a day apart! His birthday is tomorrow. This made me think to give him a daisy duke themed birthday party. Thank you for the birthday ideas.😁
Omg a vlog!!! Hope you guys are doing well!!! Love the content!!!
12:57 e n c o u r a g e m e n t
My Bussy Is Wet.
You said pipe 3 too many times...go change. 😂😂😂
I've been missing the Vlogs!
“I had to get kinda wet for this one.”  Me too, pal. Me too.
A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one
All these years of gmm, and we finally get to see a wife. Glad to see the house they bought being fully used too
Rhett could land a hair contract with those lush curls
I need an entire calendar of these photos made please
10:17 Cookie Monster? 😂
Yay!! Happy birthday Jessie!
15:29 what happened to rhetts arm 😂
Link's turn.
happy birthday Jessie !!
Petition for Jesse to dress up and do a Rihanna Photoshoot for Rhett's birthday
I still don’t see mamoa but I totally see Viking 😄
🤸‍♀️🙃😎
Jenna’s job description gets weird sometimes 🤣🤣
I haven’t laughed this hard in a long time! Happy Birthday, Jessie!
She looks hot in background with that hose hahaha
This was HILARIOUS
Jenna is thicc!
Her reactions were the best part! They’re so cute together. 🥰
I love this video !!!
What a great video. Loved the reactions from his wife.
THEYRE BACK!
I like rhett with glasses on 🖤
Best. Thing. Ever. 😁
Link is like what? You're supposed to get things for your wife on her birthday?
@ approx 6mins; 🤔Gal sees Her Celebrity?🤫😉
Need more vlogs on this channel
i love this that was thoughtful lol, i hope she had a happy birthday!
You guys are just Hilariously Ridiculous! And thank you both for that!🖖🤙✌🤘🤟🤞👊
I love this 😆 Rhett Mamoa
:)
5:58 I love Jenna's reaction 😂 she seems so flustered
LOL this is amazing 🤩🤩
2:24 that look Link gives the camera
Link: "Why am I involved? Why are they involved?" I don't know but why look a gift horse in the mouth when we can look a wet Rhett in the pecs?
This is amazing lol!
I love this video so much I laughed so hard
We need Link as Keith Urban
Lmfao "bY HeR!?" 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Rhett=Momoa
We definitely need a Link-Keith urban video.
Link is a terrible hype man.
Person: “what do you do for a living?” Jenna: “well, I sprayed my boss with a hose last weekend...”
Poor Link was in misery. 😂😂😂
That was such a great surprise you gave your wife. She is lucky to have you.
: )
people really watch this channel on purpose
Link- "Wow, this is going so well, it looks great!" Rhett- "HORSE FLESH"
not only is he photoshopping memories he is literally making them momoa is now, thanks to birthday magic
3:16 Richard!!!!
Happy Birthday Jessie! What a thoughtful and funny birthday gift! :)
I laughed until I cried several times during this video.
Amazing 👏 🙀 😮
My uncle is friends with him i can hook you up maybe
Jessie's reaction to the book made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside
Yay more vlogs please!
Hey.. Don't give this guy a hard time; He's secure in himself enough to say this is ok. He's sweet to do this for her.. And he's doing some roleplay with his wife..I would too! Anything she wants. Know what else?..a personal trainer could buff him up, get a makeover..bam, she has her own Mamoa-man.
Happy Birthday Jessie!
awwwwwwwww
Manoa is just such a nice dude to fans and stuff that the sculpted body is a bonus
I didn’t know Jason mamoa knew Rhett.  I never thought I’d see mamoa mimick Rhett pics
Is it important to wear green while photographing green screen? Like link does?
I personally believe that when you are in an intimate relationship, that it is best not to talk about who you think is sexy, especially who is the sexiest. Best to just let that conversation lay low.
I knew I likes these guys! Link's wife and I have the same hall pass. I know wanna see a Keith Urban Link
https://youtu.be/S0ktIW3NH5g
What a simp.

You look just like him 😁
It's cool that you went through all this effort for your wife. That's LOVE
this was hilarious and so sweet!
I laughed SO. HARD. AT KEITH URBAN
Did not expect this one. Found by assident
That was so sweet. This was a fun video 💜💜
So I think the beard pony tail is reflective of the size of their male members and that's what she is really wanting.......
I’ve been waiting for them to post forever
You know how they say laughter is the best medicine? *_this is the best medicine_*
rhett is so hot. she's so lucky
Well played Rhett hehehe the wife is pleased. Well played ;-)
Great video
I'm surprised they didn't do any photos from StarGate Atlantis
Hello I am 1x female girl interested in Jenna She's so pretty 😩
I reallyyyy hope Jason sees this-- just to see Jessie's reaction, so cute <3 <3 <3 so sweet
AHHHH THEYRE BACK!!!!! WELCOME BACK
I absolutely loved this!!  ❤️🤣
2021 starting strong :D
You know you are/were a band kid when you laughed at "more cowbell"
Omg this was hilarious!! 🤣🤣🤣
This was very entertaining! Welcome back! :)
Oh.... my gawd. This video had me scream laughing! This was wonderful! And I love how great Rhett and Link work together, it came out SO great! Love love love this video!
I've missed these videos! They're my favorite!
how is Jessie's laugh like, the cutest thing on this planet? I'd make it my life's quest to make her laugh, maybe that's why Rhett's a comedian 🤔
i cant believe we finally get to see jessie on camera. shes so pretty!
that was awesome haha
All I have to say is that she has a type. Happy birthday Jesse!
wait... does the creative house have a pool?! game changer.
ok so now that this is done can we get the nicely groomed shorter hair back :D
YYYYEEEESSSS!
More like Viking
OMG IM CRYING- I LOVE THIS VIDEO SM
the fact that these are my two top crushes... i definitely have a type
CONE??!!
So that's why you grew the hair out
Yes there back
i literally could not tell that was rhett on the thumbnail
Link we know what you did.
I hope this is a weekly thing again to have like  vlog
Link:when was the last time you were laid. Rhett: a bunch of bullshit said to stall so he doesn't have to say its been like 3 years
N
but whos rhetts hall pass...
Rhett your wife should ONLY have eyes  for YOU!!!!!! fuvk that hall passes are cheating
Spectacular!!
I have to say that Rhetts hair is mighty impressive! Jason Mamoa is my hall pass too 🔥 Happy Birthday Jessie 💗
Oh yeah. Rhett got that low end theory on his wall
Now that was funny!!!
Awww this was cute!!!! Happy birthday Jessie!!!
what a win-win situation! jessie had to have a really happy time looking thru the gift rhett gave her and we had a chance to see how they made it 🥺🥺 i missed the vlogs so much, glad to see it back 💕💕💕
best idea ever!
Why are you still in California? It’s ridiculous that you are still supporting Newsom.
Do they not realise they could have cut the cone to make it smaller 💀💀
encourages
Jessie definitely has a type! Rhett and Jason do have a lot of similarities!
It’s clear, that the next celebrity guest needs to be Jason. And you should have Jessie come in, and not know ahead of time. 😍
I can't wait to see Link as Keith Urban
Link, casually ask Rhett:" When is the last time you get laid?" 😂😂 That level of friendship is unreal 😂😂 me and my friend has been friends for almost 10 years and never once did we ask each other that question
I want someone to look at me the way Jessie  looks at Rhett at the end of the video.
We need Link as Keith Urban now.
Next time Link as Seamus Dever plz lol check the likeness!
😆😆😆
HAPPY BIRTHDAY!
I never knew how much I needed Rhett McLaughlin in eyeliner until this very point.  Happy birthday Jessie!:)
This is true friendship and relationship goals.
Rhett is way more attractive anyway
Jenna kinda bad though...
Was anyone else shocked to see Jessie on camera? Remember the old days where it was a running gag that the wives couldn't be on camera??
Who gave this a thumbs down???
Their assistant is fine
jenna is an absolute beauty
Rett is awesome
Wow! Loved this! Keep them coming!
I love her southern accent.  Happy birthday Jessie McMomoa!!!
could've rub some oil for the drogo one, would've look even more the part. this was amazing.
I've now convinced myself this is why Rhett grew his hair out.
OMG that was great! Lmao! Jess seemed to love it.
That was worth the wait.
I can’t believe it’s Jessie
Rhett Momoa!!!
You are very generous.
“Mom, can we see Jason Momoa?” “We have Jason Momoa at home.” *Jason Momoa at home:*
When I saw the pics on Instagram I was HOPING there’d be a video to boot... so happy there was! With a reaction from Jessie, too! You are such an amazing husband, Rhett 💜 or should I say Jason? 😝
i'm in love with jenna wowee eeee
This made me laugh so hard 😂
Y'all need to stop dropping the ball on this channel. I blame Link, I know in my heart it was him.
Jason Mamoa ft Luigi
We only lay each other 😂😂😂😂
This was such a great video!!!
#crazy I stopped my 9-5 with the help of 𝗳𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗮𝗶𝗹𝘆𝗽𝗮𝘆 .𝗰 𝗼 𝗺  0:03
Rhett McCucklin
Jessie looks like those twins, I can't remember their name.
I honestly was not expecting this channel to come back anytime soon, so my heart is really happy to see this, I absolutely love the vlogs and have missed them!
This totally explains the hair transformation...
That was funny and a sweet gift to your wife.
Link: "I don't love what this might be doing for his ego"  Everyone else: *nods*
So stinking cute
This is just sooo cute
Link: you need to be genuinely happy Rhett: *smile engaged*
Well worth the wait. I love the vlogs and was sad they went away.
The velvet Hook strikes again! 3:25 That was Rhett's nickname in high school.
Such a great comeback video, would love to see the vlogs back again
The only YouTube Vlogs I enjoy
Where is a music video! New music video!? From 2016 no one music video! What is it!?))))
So happy the vlogs are back!!!!!!!
i agree with your wife rhett i too am a huge fan of jason i loooooooooove him and the rock
What a great gift for the wife! Now that's how you husband!
Wow okay I’m hoping this channel is back
Well worth the wait. 😍 Rhett, you're an awesome husband for doing that for Jessie. 😁 HAPPY BIRTHDAY, JESSIE!☺️🎂
I'm sorry Link but I'm going to have to encourage this. 😂
Who knew jessie was more Southern than Rhett and Link
Oh wow didn’t expect a video on this channel
Happy birthday Jesse!
I wish to have a wife like this mans one day.
I don't watch GMM anymore but I love you guys when you don't have to keep yourselves to a set format, so I'm so glad these vlogs are back!
Yeah I'ma need more photos in that pink outfit 👀
You know Jason Momoa is going to now sleep with Rhett's wife. And Rhett will have to watch.
I'm a married woman.. but Rhett is MY celebrity crush!!
Rhett is trying to be all sexy and Jessie is cracking up and called him cute 🤣🤣🤣 Jenna is so talented. More cowbell, and more Jenna 🥰🤣
I've missed these vlogs so much! It always makes me laugh when the crew are involved, imagine that being your job 🤣🤣🤣
Now I know why Rhett grew his hair out.
2 thumbs up. great video.
Happy Birthday Jesse! 🍩🧁🎉🎊
So thats why Rhett looks the way he looks😏
I really like seeing Rhett doing something for his wife. The reaction and reveal was adorable. ❤️
so this is why he's been growing his hair and beard out
Wholesome-est thirst trap ever. I love Jessie so much at the end! 💚
DID NOTTT think they would do the vlogs again but I’m NOT complaining!!! LOVE THE VLOGS!!!
Keith Urban...
Way to come back, happy birthday Jessie you lucky girl
Link: don’t encourage him in the comments  All the people that are the beast at commenting.....
ON A COMPLETELY UNRELATED NOTE.  Y'all should redo My Hair Song to reflect y'alls hair now. P.S Happy Birthday Jessie!
This whole last year I've thought that Rhett looks like Jason Momoa, so this video validated me in my own mind 😂
This made me smile so much lol
I'm crying 😂
Sorry link but i cant help but encourage him on this one, it is the sweetest thing to have done this♥️😭
omg Jenna is an absolute rocket launcher 😍😍
Mythical Beasts, please tell me what camera was Rhett using?
ill cry i was thinking about rhett and link vlogs yesterday
Yaaasss more vlogs I love this !
I NEEEEEEED THAT BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!
Yay!
It would be fantastic if Jason Momoa saw this video and in return he did a photoshoot as Rhett.
I love this! I think both Jason mamoa and Rhett and sexy as hell. This was awesome 😁
I’m so freaking excited. This was worth the wait!
Happy birthday Jessie!!
"Rhett, you should be in the next Aquaman movie. And happy Birthday Jessie!"  - my nephew
I have been ejfouraged link
Happy Birthday Jessie!
Now when are we going to see Link as Keith Urban?
Dear Rhett and Link,  I have the same black brown red and yellow abstract canvas that sits behind link in the beginning introduction.  I have been trying to find out the artist for over 10 years and haven't been able to figure it out. Please help me out if you see this comment!
"Okay now make all of your muscles bigger"
This made me cry tears of joy
Aqua makes man happy
Haha 😄  Job well done guys
They're back!
Rhett is so into himself. love it!
Yes! Success! Had me laughing out loud. Keep up with this, and you’re golden in my books! The last vlogs were fun, but this was super entertaining, thanks guys/mythical team
Cam we just appreciate the time and effort put into this and her reaction LOVE IT
Link is so insecure it's almost insulting. 🤣
Yes !! They’re returned!!!
Hahahah “That Marvel guy...”-Link
I like how Jason Momoa is her "celebrity" crush but if you Google it Rhett's net worth is $6 million more than Momoa's.... 😯
i love these vlogs so much i wish more people watched them
His beard looks to nappy but eveything else somewhat match beside his pale skin.
Loving the fact that this was a birthday present for Jessie but lowkey it's a not-really-birthday present for us! Happy bday, Jessie!
Can't wait to see Link as Keith Urban 🤣
15:18 Awww they did the little head tilt at the same time
Uh.... why does she think the necklace is a cone?  It's clearly made out of some kind of greenstone/jade, and it's blatantly not a code lmao
#dothis I quit my job with the help of 𝗳𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗮𝗶𝗹𝘆𝗽𝗮𝘆 . 𝗰𝗼 𝗺  1:93
Happy bday Jessie
rhetts mouth is so small omg
So this is what we call a sacrifice... Nice video guys!
You guys are adorable
Less than 2 minutes in and I already want to die from pure awkwardness.
Man I wonder what happened after the camera stopped recording.
Rhett>Momoa
This video she be titled “how to psychologically recalibrate your wife’s desires”
I didn’t realized I needed this until you made this! Also, I’m sure Jason Mamoa would meet your wife Rhett and give you tips on the poses if you asked him, that amazing dude is down for a lot of cool stuff!
I'm so glad they continued to do the vlogs I really loved this  I love Me some Jason Mamoa!
That’s actually such a sweet gift. So much thought. Happy birthday Jessie!
Tbh he looks more like a Viking than Aquaman here, lol
we finally know why rhett has been growing his hair out
"Horse Flesh." 10:30
“More cowbell” 💀
He wasn’t wearing a silver cone. He was wearing a Pounamu (green stone).. But that cone made me crack up 😂
Everyone like this so we get more vlogs!!
Love this
wow tmi
So this is why Rhett has been growing out his hair
If Jenna made an only fans, she would get plenty of subs 😂
THATS LOVE!!!
Jason Momoa is her hall pass...THAT EXPLAIN'S RHETT'S HAIR AND BEARD
I LOVE THIS!!! AND WE GOT TO SEE JESSIE! Happy Birthday Jessie!!!
Happy Birthday Jessie!  Links turn... You never know, maybe Christie finds Rachael Maddow sexy.
They both kinda look like their wives’ hall passes😂
😂 omg. I'm only here to encourage Rhett to do more silly stuff like this.
Jessie is honestly the most precious human on earth
Oh this was great! Made me smile and laugh. Rhett, it is impressive how much you pulled off looking like Jason Momoa and great work to Link and The Mythical Crew member(s) who did the photoshop. I thought it was a thoughtful gift.  Happy Birthday to your beautiful wife!!!
This was funny and sweet :)    seriously tho, Keith Urban?? LOL I can't
YOU BROKE THE RULE WHAT THE HECK????
I think  Rhett  pols it off very nicely. Happy birthday  Jessie.
with as much respect as possible, jenna has a smoking body
SO EXCITED TO SEE A POSTING!!!! Great Bday gift! Im jealous!
Jenna u painting Rhett with ur left hand
Very cute
Wait... they showed her face!!!
This is hilarious
Jessie is gonna dress as Rihanna for Rhetts birthday
Links turn for his wife😂please 🙏 Keith urban look would be hilarious
Iconic
This was aweseome. I know link said to not encourage you, but it was hilarious, her reactions were priceless, so happy for you both that it turned out great!
Finding a way to write off your wife birthday present has business expense. Way to go!!
Is this the reason why Rhett kept his hair long?
I love that I didn’t know that I needed this
Now do McConaughey!
I just wanna be layed by you too Rhett
Is it bad to admit both Rhett and Link are my hall pass???..lol😘😍
Honestly if Rhetts wife had said her hall pass was Matthew McConaughey, this could have gone a whole lot easier.
This is just sickly sweet. Love might exist after all.
This video was a pleasant surprise! I love the effort
Link is a great friend and Rhett is so sweet for doing all this for his wife 👍👍❤️❤️
Aqua man ❌ Wet McLaughlin ✅
I don't normally watch this stuff but...I've got to show my wife this one.
The jessie unmasking lol. Finally.
Link: "You need to be genuinely happy..." Rhett: Smallest smile in the history of the world 😐
LMFAO!!!
This was probably the best birthday present ever!
OMG THE WEEKEND VLOGS ARE BACK!!! THESE ARE THE BEST! THANK YOU!!!!!💚💚💚💚
Link you might be wrong. jason momoa us a verry attractive man.
Soooo happy to have this video
Happy birthday Jessie! Happy to see you on this!
Is it just me or did Rhett just kill the pink look. ❤❤❤😍😍😍
Link: Don’t encourage him in the comments Me:  RHETT LOOKS AMAZING 😍
I thought the title said Rhett becomes Jason Mimoa but I didn’t see him in the blog at all, cool you got to meet Jason though Link
I smiled the entire vlog! Love this!!
it bothers me so much that all they had to do was pull the auqaman shirt down tight so there wouldnt be folds in it...easy fix ruined the pic
I’m so glad that y’all are doing the vlogs still. I love the here or there schedule y’all have adopted with them because they are an exciting surprise!
“I got a garden hose” 🤣💀💀
this was awesome!!!! I love the Vlogs!
Haha, I love this! It’s actually such a thoughtful gift from Rhett! Happy birthday Jessie! ❤️
Wait  Is this their creative house? It’s looks different. Is so they get a creative apartment?
POST ON THIS CHANNEL MORE PLS
Why is no one pointing out that both Rhett and Links wives’ hall passes look like their husbands lol
Link hating every moment of this is the best part lol!
I had so much fun watching this video and seeing Jessie's happiness was the best!!  <3
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO MRS MCMOMOA!!!!!
I love love love this. Just my two favorite guys being hilarious, Link not happy about what it could be doing for his ego
Hahahahaha this was great
10:00
I really wanna see link as Keith urban lmao
VLOGS ARE BACK???? I LOVE THE VLOGS!
Link as Kieth Urban would be... interesting
Awhhhh that was so cute!!!!
We do not support this behavior
Why is the girl masked and Rhett and Link aren't?
I love that you guys are back doing podcasts. I absolutely love them. It's like back in the day when you guys were writing your own stuff.so all those fans who have been here for a while and are older could appreciate it especially with all your more adult humor.  We've all aged together so our humor is maturing.
My prayers have been answered! Rhett and Link channel has uploaded again!!
I'm just now realizing how much shep looks like him 😳
I missed the Rhett and Link videos so much! I'm so glad they're back! This video is endlessly hilarious and entertaining!
ARE THE WEEKLY VLOGS BACK?
@jasonmomoa you need to react to this
Unexpected but appreciated
He definitely got laid after this 😂
That pink outfit is nice.
Finally an upload
So happy your a Marvel fan ^_^
Rhett trying to get into character: HORSE FLESH 😂😂😂
Cant believe after all these years Jessie is just casually on camera now wow
I AM SO SO SO SO SO EXCITED TO SEE JESSIE IN ONE OF THESE!! She is my Twitter queen. I love her 😭😭😭😭
rhett absolutely fits in with the dothraki
Don't encourage him in the comments.... He is hot. Hot af!
Thanks for the laugh guys.. this was too funny
rhett is so stiff 😂
I can't believe you got Jason Momoa himself to come take picture for your wife
We clearly MUST get Jason Momoa to comment on this!  He has an Instagram called prideofgypsies.
dang, ive missed these videos
link really brought his A game
was she saying a cone necklace? I don't know what that is lol but I know Jason mamoa is definitely just wearing a greenstone necklace in typical polynesian fashion lol
Link is so funny in this video.  My favorite comment:  More cowbell.
“Be legitimately happy.” Lol, I love photographer Link 😂😂
Thank you SO much!!!! 💖💖💖
YES pls give us more vlogs ..plsss!!!
ahahah XD
Wow. I’m speechless.
I love it!! I love your reaction. Rhett is so lucky to have you. Happy birthday Jessie. Sorry link but Rhett is hot. Lol
Link...fantastic work on doing the photography.  Rhett....you did something.  Rhett, in all seriousness...you nailed it.  This video was unexpected, welcomed, and way more wholesome than some of the content may lead to believe.  lol
Link needs to work on his self-security 😅 Maybe a little photoshoot for him would help his self confidence
i didn’t know this was coming but i’m excited to watcch
I do not encourage you, Rhett. I do not encourage you at all.
So glad that these are back!
I CANT HANDLE JESSE 💚😍
you know they got down and dirty after this
This made me smile. I'm gonna show this to my future husband. This is going to be one of my wedding vows.
Rhett the Beast
Jenna deserves a raise 😂
Aww, she's sweet
That was worth the wait
Why is no one talking about Jessie being on camera!? I’m just in shock. Finally!!! ❤️
Are we sure that was a cone and not a tassel?
That’s cute 🥺
Love it! Keep vlogging if you can!
Heh I knew he grew out that mess because it make his wife sticky lol.
I'm glad I watched this. I'm so very, very glad.
Loved this!!!!!
@jasonmomoa
*this* is my kink
Is next week's video going to be Link as Keith Urban?
Now we know the real reason he’s growing his hair and beard
FINALLY THEY POSTED ANOTHER VLOG VIDEO.IVE BEEN WAITING FOREVER.
20k likes.. we thirsty
Happy Birthday, Jessie!!!
We need more vids/vlogs like this EVERY SATURDAY PLEASE
I'm sorry that I couldn't like the video twice! Too funny!!! Can't wait for Link to do his photo shoot
I... yes. Yes. We needed this chaotic energy of a video.
Amazing. 😂 I could only dream of a husband to do what Rhett did
YEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSssssssssssssssssssssssss I've been waiting for another vlog. I miss hanging out with you guys outside of GMM.
this is so funny
Rhett is way more attractive then jason tho
the boys are back in town
YAYYY finally some Jessie content besides her awesome twitter
I like how link started out with the long hair and then they switched.
Can we all agree he kinda pulled this off?
This is AMAZING 💙💙😄
The life of rhett and links assistant 🤣
The vlogs are the best I want more errday
When Rhett said He's gonna Grow out his beard and hair..... This the moment He was waiting for😂.....Great U 3👏👏❤️
I hope Jason mamoa sees this 😂
Link: "I don't love what this might be doing for his ego...." 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Happy Birthday, Jessie! You are a lucky girl! I can't wait for Link turn.
Woah they showed Jessie
Rhetts taller than Jason by three inches
Get you a man that turns into another man for ya
Im genuinely joyful about this
Am I the only one that doesn’t find Jason momoa that attractive. Just not my type. I’m more attracted to the clean cut look
That pink outfit is fire
I honestly love that you did this for your wife HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO HER
Awesome video and great job! You’re wives should be in more videos. Maybe even host a GMM video
*me waiting for the same video but its Link trying to be Keith Urban*
So I’m just putting this out there... Jason is amazing, but I think Rhett is amazing also.
So Rhett, who is your celebrity hall pass?
The Return of the Kings
WIFE?????
Need Link’s thirst trap video next!!!
3:53 I got a fever...
well aloha rhett momoa! happy b-day!
Jessie is so stunning! Rhett is so lucky💕 they are such a beautiful couple
#RelationshipGoals. Love this.
I love Jessie! Her Twitter is gold and her laugh is adorable.
This video has made me realize that Rhett is NOT a Zaddy, juust a Daddy.
This is probably how Rhett is gonna look during the apocalypse
Wow OKAY
This is was so cute, what a great husband
Im a straight dude but not going to lie, Rhett looked hot in that pink getup.
This was the best Saturday surprise vlog ever!!! I laughed until I cried!!
When you order Sprite and get melo yellow 😂😂😂😂😂
Definitely they are the funniest when they are just being themselves
Their assistant pretty cute tho 🥺🥺
From the bottom of my heart, thank you!
Jenna deserves a raise.
Why does Rhett kinda look like him lmao
this was great, i need vlogs every saturday plz
More Jessie, please! As a Jessie myself I would watch any content with her in it!
This is awsome!
Please, please keep doing these!
yay new gmm vlog!
I am going to marry your assistant, speaking it into existence
Jessie’s reaction was so cute
This was great. Just great.
This has me busting up laughing 😂
I needed this today
I love this🥺❤️
Rhett and Link are quite possibly the hottest YouTube duo ever
This was worth the wait XD So glad the vods are back.
awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww😆!
I think you are wrong, Link. I think Jason really is pretty to everyone. :)
Happy Birthday Jessie!!
This is cute and weird
1:85 I quit my job thanks to 𝗳𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗮𝗶𝗹𝘆𝗽𝗮𝘆 .𝗰𝗼𝗺
Is that why you've been growing out your hair for so long?!
Oh...I was hopping for a kiss at the end! Happy Birthday!!!
Great idea! I’m glad it was a success.
Jenna needs a raise
I hope my future husband will love me as much as Rhett loves his Jessie.
Keith Urban is sexy as hell! I agree, Kristy!
This made me smile so hard, my cheeks hurt.
this is legendary
Jessie McLaughlin is a literal goddess and I would die for her. She deserves EVERYTHING.
Yall need more soft things in that house. Sounds like a old cave.
The hair and beard all make sense now.. this was what everything was building to over the last 2 years
whoever does the subs dont speak southern, link said i havent seen it not i have a secret, smh
Rhett is so sexy omg. 🔥
DANG, Jenna is an 11/10 for sure
😂😂😂😂😂
"Don't show me the hole.  That's why I got this towel on."  😂
this was worth the wait
Why is this so wholesome
Jason is 6’ 4”.....Rhett is 6’ 7”.....so really, it’s not that far off. Rhetts got the hair and the height. He just needs a spray tan, a bunch of protein shakes, and a “few” months of bench presses.
This has inspired me 🤣
I am SO excited the vlog is back:) and Jenna is the best.
Oh my gosh they are so funny just by existing I LOVE IT
This was worth the wait.
Okay this was amazing 😂😂😂😂😂
That was so funny😂
"alright, I'm gonna go get wet over here and then I'll come back"
It’s apparent your wife has a type, Rhett! 😂
I'm so happy that the two man vlog is back! I was so sad when it went away! I missed it so much!
JESSIE IS STUNNING
Romantic
Rhett - Imagine yourself bearing a fang on one side like a wolf or dog does, and then imagine the "threat" you are displaying is playful and mischievous. That'll get you to, or at least towards, those expressions.
Hello
Link: Don't encourage him in the comments Us: No  This was amazing, I love Jessie and I'm glad she loved this so much since it's funny, cute, and took a team effort LOL
You don’t have a hair on them Link, if you do not do the Keith Urban photo shoot.
Link is hilarious in this
I feel compelled to say "That was worth the wait"
I'm just happy the vlogs are back :)
This is real love and dedication.. Signing my husband up for a photo shoot Rhett and Link style 🥰🥰🥰
worth the wait 100 percent
I really enjoyed this so much.  I love her reaction. 🥰  this was everything to me!!(LINK😜)......   Y'all remind me of my hunny and I 😍😍 thanks for sharing.   Much love from Wayne County NC ❤
lol its clear their wives have a type as even keith urban is rocking the same hair that link used to have years ago
"We lay each other" is probably the funniest euphemism 😂
i've never actaully seen jessie b4, shes so beautiful
"Now...make all of your muscles bigger" *squeeze grunt*
I want Link to know that we all fully encourage this behavior.
This is the best vlog since Skynwallz. I’m so happy.
Omg!! I loved her reaction
This is too cute how DARE you
Yeah was not expecting a Vlog even though I've been begging for more, but a wonderful surprise for everyone!! Happy birthday Jesse
Laughed the entire video 😂😂
That was a very sweet and thoughtful gift. The pure joy on her face was priceless.
"by her?". Danger....
It is adorable to see how different Rhett is when he’s with Jessie . His whole demeanor is different, he’s so sweet and gentle 🥺
Hang on. 4:51 Link's hat 😆
this was hilarious. well done, rhett. happy bday, jessie.
I have never laughed and cringed so hard in my life 🤭
Happy Birthday Jessie
Loved her reaction xD
Ok but that wet t-shirt photo, even before editing? 🔥🔥
This has to be my favorite Rhett and link video ever! You guys did a great job on the photos and book. And Jessie definitely enjoyed it. Thanks for sharing, made my day 🖤
It would be funny if Jason Momoa and Rhianna become a couple.
Rhett in those glasses 🤤
Remember when we had to scroll down to see comments
The wifes definitely both have a distinct type :D
Yaaasssssss the pink jams is where its at Rhett 😍😍😍😍😍
Happy birthday Jesse!!!
There assistant is actually really hot
Happy Birthday Jessie!!!!!!!
Better then GMM
Lol I love how their wives definitely have a type that they're interested in because I think Rhett and link sort of resemble their wives hallpass celebrities.
this is when having a perfectionist friend pays off
I missed Jenna’s laugh so much!! 😄
This is the absolute best thing I’ve seen all week A++
the pink outfit is a LOOK
jenna better be getting paid as much as I hope she’s getting paid
Methinks a bulk order for that muscles shirt is showing up on Jessie's Amazon account right now. Thirst trap SPRUNG!
This is hilarious but also wow I hope someday someone loves me this much to go through all the trouble to do something like this. So sweet 😂
This video was totally worth waiting 8 months for!!!! 🤣🤣🤣 can’t wait for a Keith urban shoot
You should get Jason Mamoa to become you for you and just hang out with you (Jason Mamoa) in front of your wife.
Yay vlogs!!! What a lovely Saturday surprise!
Hell yeah!! I didn’t know this is what I needed
Happy birthday 🎂 🥳 🎉
Yaaaaas
jessie is so cute
That was worth the wait
That's the most adorable thing I've ever seen.
“Are you asking me to partake in a thirst trap video” 😂😂💀💀
Link grumbling the entire time is the best! 😂 Makes me think of a friend when I pull her into one of my schemes!!
Seeing a notification from the Rhett and Link vlog channel made my day!!
Rhett + hot = Rhott!
It would be fun to watch Jason Momoa himself do a reaction video to this! 😆
Since when is Jason momoa on the show
I missed these 😭
And that goes well, and happens often 😂
Hahaha well this explains why Rhett is married and I am not I've never wanted to take photos and make a book for someone.
All you needed for the pink suit photo was a box fan. ;-)
This was amazing! Lol link please do Keith urban!
why is rhett so damn fine
Lol
Omg Jessie is the cutest!!
so this was the goal all along
OMG VLOGS
Jesse has a thing for tall men with long hair and nice beards
Your wife and are the same
He looks like Conan, but with curly hair and a beard.
Yes, this vlog was worth the wait. 💯 Yes, we want to be part of it. 😁
The rest of the video will be on Rhett's onlyfans
If you guys don’t do this with link as Keith urban for Kristie.... I’m out
Did Rhett have an allergic reaction to that paint or something? Lmao
❤️❤️❤️
Plot twist: Rhett’s been growing out his hair specifically for this
This is actually the best video that has ever been made on this channel. Rhett and Jessie are so cute!
Finally!
17 seconds into this and her laugh and badass earrings have already made me like her a LOT
Honestly getting Link to look like Keith urban wouldn't be too difficult, very similar facial structures. The hair obviously poses a problem. Links uncomfortableness in this video is definitely a mood though! Ha ha ha
1:74 I quit my 9-5 with the help of 𝗳𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗮𝗶𝗹𝘆𝗽𝗮𝘆 .𝗰𝗼𝗺
Awww this was so cuteee 🥰🥰🥰🥰
Lol she is so cute
7:54 Rhett is doing what most people do who don’t have shoulders leaning forward to make it appear like he has broad shoulders when he should be leaning back like the actual person he’s trying to be in the photograph
Wheezed so much I nearly needed an inhaler!!!   Wet McMamoa!!!
Is that a tribe by quest albumn in your office???
Jenna’s little squeal when he put on the aqua man shirt may be the best thing ever
15:05 Psycho sound intensifies
This made me happier than it should have 😂 Happy Birthday Jessie!!!!
omfg.
Omg I’m so happy! I’m a huge gmm fan but this is my favorite content you guys make. It’s so genuine.
I love this so much
I'm so happy there's a new vlog! I love these!
Exactly the content i needed today
PhotoShop Your Memories!
Happy birthday Jessie! And try to see him in StarGate - Atlantis  @Rhett: You could cosplay him
Wasn’t expecting this? Umm :)
can we just appreciate the pure love and adoration in jessies eyes as she was looking at rhett towards the end?
13:48 that's my face when i, too, don't want to get involved in this LOL
Yep, Jessie laid Rhett that night.
brilliant!!!
Jessie is one lucky lady. So happy to get another vlog from the boys.
He looks like the big Lebowski
I’m so glad to know that Rhett’s bedroom life is very health 😂
Hmm...not quite lol
Most cu*k thing ever
wait are the vlogs back?!?! Or is this just a one time thing
I believe this video is the key to world peace.
Link, do not look below!!   Rhett, that was awesome! Happy belated birthday to Jessie!!
Thank you for blessing us with a new vlog
This was so cute!! But also so hilarious. Aw jessie!! You and rhett ars gems!
This was too cute
I'm glad it's back
🎉🎉🎉
Holy cow the last vlog was already eight months ago?!?!
I just realized this is recent happy birthday Jessie!
Link “I’m not a magician”
THEY FINALLY POSTED
Now I want to see Link as Keith Urban
Rhett out here looking like a Jason Momoa from Wish lol
man becomes a different man for his wife
Omg I was not expecting this but I looovvvveee this
This is unbelievably awesome! 😂
alternate title: link helps rhett make thirst traps
I love Sturgill Simpson! I see it on the wall. And when link wears his concert shirt. It’s really turtles all the way down
I have now realized why Rhett grew his hair out.
This was adorable, hilarious and sweet. Happy Birthday Jessie 🎈😁.
Okay but this is the goofiest, sweetest vlog on all of the YouTubez☺️ Happy Birthday Jessie and welcome back Rhett & Link
When you buy Jason Mamoa on wish
thank you so much guys. you are such an inspiration to me. you are the kindest people on youtube. period. thank you so much for your content. cya
yess! finally a vlog!
Awwwww this is super cute 🥰
Fantastic comeback for vlogs
I think we learned the real reason Rhett has been growing his hair.
The pink outfit feels very Rhett honestly.
Ahhh I'm so happy the vlogs are back! And with a Jason momoa theme! So worth the wait!
Jessie is so lucky.
300% worth the wait
The vlogs are back!!! Yes!!
This makes me so happy! Couples should take their relationship as an example. I love Link’s awkwardness!
I wasn't expecting that they were able to get the pink pajamas
This was amazing!! I laughed so dang hard!! What an awesome surprise to wake up to today!!!
The Khal Drogo was the best.
Deeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeyuuuuuuuuuuuum
Happy Birthday Jessie!! This was great and your reaction was amazing! -The Nunnery Family
This is honestly super adorable
I’m just sayin I’ve never seen them in the same room
I actually didn’t even realize this was uploaded 6 hours ago lol, what a happy surprise
Rhett “i’m trying to get laid” Momoa
2:22 oh we’re thirsty 😆🥵
*Now tha hair makes sense, got it got it*
This is the content I crave from y'all honestly. Super sweet too so it's a real win here today!
Jessie’s accent is my favorite thing in the world. I just need her to give me daily affirmations everyday.. is it too much to ask?!?
I thought they had a rule about showing their wives on camera.
My dog died this morning and you’ve made me laugh. Thank you
This is amazing 😂
This was hilarious. Hope your wife had a wonderful birthday.... now please tell me we are doing the Keith urban version for link to give to his wife 😂
My freaking abs hurt from laughing at the “Aqua makes man happy” scene.
Christie’s hall pass being Karl Urban made me laugh the rest of the blog 😂😂😂
Rhett is much hotter
i see a tribe called quest in the back 👀
Yes vlogs are back
That was worth the wait!   P.s. happy birthday Jessie
1:94 I stopped my job because of 𝗳𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗮𝗶𝗹𝘆𝗽𝗮𝘆 .𝗰𝗼𝗺
Ok this was fun to watch.
Yay rhett & link channel upload!!!
The Vlogs are back!!! 😊
Wow. Jessie is quite the southern bell with that accent.
Now it’s links turn with his wife lol
Never seen Jessie on camera, but wow she is so beautiful.
GUYS, this vlogs you do are so funny, keep it up👌🏻 been waiting along time for a new one.
I love this on so many levels. 🤣
so happy their vlogs are back lol
This was delightful!! Happy Birthday Jessie!!!
Jessie's laugh is the best thing I’ve heard.
Yes Rhett Yes!!
Oh my goodness guys being guys Link it's ok you helped your friend that is a credit but for everything else we saw was WHAT THE HECK!!! LOL
Rhett seriously needs to shave part of his eyebrow, I think it would complete the look 😌
I am LIVING for this!!! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
This was so sweet of Rhett. Jessie is a lucky lady.
Link is a Marvel guy, approval rating increased.
Happy birthday Jessie! Loving the on-camera debut!!
This was the funniest vlog ever, I had tears the whole time 🤣😂🤣😂
That was so sweet!
I love this
I love this vlog so much! Jessie is such a lovely person and rhett is a very beautiful human
I wish they did a couple where Rhett was just being himself in the Jason Momoa outfits so it would come off more natural
This is cute lol
Keith Urban lol
Link saying "Keith Urban" SENT MEEE HAHAAA!!!
Happy birthday Jessie!!!!!
Sorry, Link. I have to say they look a little similar.
Yes! your back whit them vlog's :D <3
That was so cute
Link is being such a sourpuss! lol
That was so nice and funny 😂😂
What a comeback video
I want to have such a cute husband one day too. I'm jealous rn. 😭😭😭🤣❤️
This was great to watch!!!  The revile was actually super cute, made me smile.
Haha! Damn, Link roasted his wife's hall pass person. Freaking brutal! haha
Lmao this was amazing
it was indeed worth the wait
more videos with Jessie please 🥺
"I got a garden hose" I dont know why I laughed so hard at that
loved this!! lmfaooo but rhett is super attractive as is just being himself.. and this is coming from a lesbian.
I love Jessie and Rhett so much! This surprise video made my weekend. Happy birthday Jessie you deserve all the love in the world ♥️
Myrtle Beach STAND UP...
Can’t say I expected to see this video today but I’m glad it happened 😂 we need to see a link version of this 10/10 ✨
I love the vlogs
Happy Birthday Jessie would love to see you more on camera
Rhett - "I gotta get wet."  Link - "I got a garden hose." Alright then.
Jessie is such a Queen! This video was so funny.
"Now make all your muscles bigger" Lmao xD
Yup, worth the wait
Me: I want Jason Momoa My mom: we have Jason Momoa at home Jason Momoa at home Me: hmmmmm, it'll do
I love this!! I hope y'all continue to post these kind of videos! Made my day.. Time to turn Link into Keith Urban.. 😂
Woah, beautiful wife man 👌
That was worth the wait
Jenna tho 👀👀👀
I was just thinking about this channel yesterday
Happy Birthday!!! Very loving aaaaaannnnd I can't unsee this or stop laughing
This definitely deserves to get a million views! Happy Birthday Jessie! ❤
THE CHANNEL NEVER DIES!
I'm just waiting for links as Keith as that is going to be just as funny
they're so in love! wow :'-)
This was amusing
I'm so happy they are posting again!!!!!
I hope Jenna got a raise lol
*Jason Momoa and Link*  let's talk about that!!!
But where is the pink outfit from??
Happy birthday Jessie!
I love Link dissaproving of rhett
"He's pretty to me"🤣😂🤣😂
“Are you asking me to participate in a thirst trap video?” Lmaoooooooo
WAIT I DIDN’T KNOW THEY WERE BRINGING THE VLOGS BACK TODAY. I’m so happy, I love these!
I'm so incredibly thankful you didnt put this behind the Mythical Society Paywall. This was very nice to watch.
jessie is the absolute cutest, loved this video
Thumbs up if you want to encourage Rhett.
The  Khal Drogo one was the best, I think!! This was so cute!
I would pay real money for the videos in this channel. They are so funny and exactly what I’m looking for in entertainment! 😂
Well i guess we can all say that this was worth the wait right
I was just showing my girlfriend the Rhett and Link quarantine videos. I am so glad they have returned!!! Thank you so much! 🙏🏽
We better see Link as Keith Urban
Rhett: What is the correct verbage?   1:32
These are my favorite videos on YouTube. Thank you guys
Ah, now I see why I started watching this channel 👀
Rhett has just raised the expectations of wives' birthdays everywhere.  I swear if my husband doesn't do this for my next birthday.....
I love this!!! Jessie is a lucky lady!
Bruh, if I was rhett's kids, I could never watch this
Rhett trying to throw in subtle jabs due to his lack of size...but glad he loves his wife.
4:30 Rhett looks like Moonwind from soul.
I was just thinking about the vlogs from a few months ago!! yayy
This was the best gift of 2021 ever!
r we back to the vids guys yes pls?!?!?!
A new vlog!!! Finally!!! The wait is over!!
Happy birthday jessie!
I needed this. I need this every week. I need.
So flipping great! She loved it
Happy birthday Jessie
This was so sweet.
THEY’RE BACK!!
**Stands next to a pool... uses hose to wet himself....
Y'all ROCK! 🤣
A new R&L Vlog was exactly what I needed today. Thank you.
so much jessie content, MBs won
Link - "Don't encourage him in the comments, that's all I'm asking"  Me - If we can't encourage him doing this what the heck are we supposed to when he helps you be Keith Urban???
I'm not just thirsty, I'm dehydrated  😉
I'm not going to say this episode crossed a line necessarily, but the line is at least giving it a wedgie.
Link hasn't seen Aquaman? SHOCKER!!!!!
I love everything about this video 🙌🏽
Theyre so cute 🥺🥺
#relationshipgoals
This is Rhett? I thought it was Jason Mamoa the whole time!
THIS. IS. GOLD.
Their wives definitely have a type hahahaha
The Photographic Adventures of Luigi and Thor
Link admitting he’s a marvel guy is no surprise and appreciated
Link is hilarious unscripted!
Yeaaa!!! Vlogs r back!!!!
I desperately want Jason Momoa to see this video
Jesse seems either drunk in love or just plain drunk.
Celebrity hall passes are dangerous when you actually might meet those celebrities
Jessie's hall pass being Jason Momoa and Christy's being Keith Urban just makes so much sense knowing Rhett & Link 😂😂😂
Happy Belated birthday Jessie!
I’m so happy for this!!
That is funny, sweet, and relationship goals! Happy birthday!
thank you for bringing this back, i missed it so much.
Jajaja amazing vid
Poor Link. Don't be a hater. 😉 Just remember that you're helping your bestie. And he will do the same for you.
i knew it! i *knew* this was coming! since he's been looking more & more like Momoa & he's spoken in the past about how she likes him
You guys need to put masks on, come on guys.
The vlogs ARE BACK
I can’t wait for Link to do this, because who wouldn’t want to see him recreate pictures of Rachel Maddow 😆
Best part of this video is Jessie <3
YES!!! VLOGS!!!
her laugh is so contagious.
like he said, he ain't a jealous man he's a savory man
Thank you for this video! It made my Saturday!! Happy Birthday Jessie!
I was unexpectedly overwhelmed to wake up to this, thank you.
So THIS IS WHY HES BEEN GROWING HIS BEARD FOR *EVER* *TRUTH UNVEILED*
Link: “you need to be genuinely happy” Rhett: 🙂
The reason why Link was upset is because this was Rhett and Jessie not Rhett and link
I love that there’s a video! I hope we don’t have to wait as long for the next one 🤞😊 but seriously just do it when you want to, it’s much better that way
Rhett with that hair has some Geico caveman vibes
Jessie's reactions were precious and adorable!!! 😊💕
Omg so cute so worth the wait! I can’t wait for UrbaNeal!!
I feel like I watched a long extended version of the “apparently you look like your boyfriends favorite Disney princess” TikTok
The vlogs seem really organized now, which I like. But it still has the R&L Lead energy.
lol, turns out we were ALL "thirsty" for a "thirsty video" from you Rhett... lol xo
I’m sorry Link but Rhett deserves to be called beautiful durong this whole video
Rhett's wife is beautiful! They are so adorable
I really hope the Saturday vlogs are coming back! Loved watching these!
woo they're back!!!
Jason Mamoa is my celebrity man crush but Rhett McMomoa is a VERY close second!🤣  Now we need to see Link Urban🤔
YESSSS THE VLOGS ARE BACK!!!!!!
I'm sorry Link but Rhett nailed the photos. Happy birthday Jessie!
Ommmgggggg ... it makes so much sense now 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
YES! The vlogs are back!!!! 🥳🥳🥳
That was worth the wait 🤷🏻‍♂️
11:16 did Rhett have a reaction to that paint?
c0oolll
MY NAME IS JENNA, SO EVERYTIME THEY SAID "jenna" I WAS LIKE "what"
This is strangely wholesome
Thanks for bringing is another vlog. I love this gift so much, well done for the effort Rhett!
Looking great, Rhett! 👍🏽☺️
Rhett looks like the Geico caveman in the suit at the beginning. Real talk this is adorable vid
We dont need jason mamoa we have McMomoa at home😂
Yesssss I’ve missed two man vlogs!!!
5:48 retts hands🤣🤣
I missed these weird crazy adventures xD
Hi, Jessie.. you're the best! Happy Bday!
Turn link into Nicholas Cage
Rhett looks like Jason Momoa and Link looks like Keith Urban
I think Rhett killed it for his wife's birthday.❤️👍
Jessie’s reaction was perfect.
"Man I was stuck with expense reports again. What did you do today at your job?"  "Oh I just painted on my boss's naked chest and sprayed him with water when he was wearing just a t-shirt and a towel so he could look like the man his wife is in love with."
I love that he did this for his wife
This is so wholesome?? Like Rhett is the perfect husband????
For the record I’d rather have Rhett McLaughlin than Jason Momoa
oh man how i'd love to have a crazy ass job like jenna has.
I wish I knew how to be this romantic with my wife
Rhetts hair transformation makes so much more sense now!!!
What an awesome surprise to wake up to! His wife is a lucky lady.
What a wonderful weekend, getting blessed with content with Jessie! 😍
This was one of the funniest and cutest thing you've ever done. And Jessie's reaction is priceless.
When you want jason momoa but your mum says we already have him at home  Him at home:
Link asking why we're involved in this...I dunno but I'm not mad about it!
THE VLOGS ARE BAAAACCKKKK🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
Yes Link, we NEEDED! to be here for this, and so DID you!!  Thank you for this joy 🤩
It’s really weird to see Jessie’s face after that ltat episode.
Whoa a new upload?!? Let’s go!!
This was great, I can't wait to see Link's transformation!!
Wow, this was brilliant! You know there will be some guys out there attempting this as well. Just sayin'.
A wild Jessie appears!! She’s so pretty!!!
This is so awesome! We are begging you Link, to dress up like Keith Urban next!!
I hope Jason Momoa see's this video. If he ever needs a body double for a movie, he knows who to call
It is BACK!!!
“More cow bell.” 😂😂
Aaaa
OMG!!!! I love Jessie so much 😭😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️
THE WAY I STARTED FANGIRLING WHEN I SAW QUEEN JESSIE 🥺😍
"...Are you asking me to participate in a thirst trap video?"  Made me crack up for some reason
i missed the vlogs :,) hbd jessie
Mom i want Jason Momoa Mom: we have Jason Momoa at home Jason Momoa at home:
12:00 can confirm. I live in dirty myrtle. we wet the tshirt THEN put them on.
Not even close lol but so sweet
Can’t wait for more vlogs - really miss them
I’m so happy we’re back here on this channel :)
Jessie's adorable :D gotta say, Rhett makes modelling look like a fun job
Careful rett the mythical beasts have a lot of power
Woa, I can't believe you managed to get Jason Momoa to do this!
Aquaman Aqua-makes-man-happy
love that mask...go vols
Much more attracted to long haired mountain man Rhett McMomoa - I take back all the comments about cutting your hair/shaving. 🤩
Much more attracted to long haired mountain man Rhett McMomoa - I take back all the comments about cutting your hair.
She is so cute!!
I thought we weren’t supposed to see what their wives looked like?? But either way, happy birthday!!
I didn’t know Rhett played in aqua man!
A new vlog! Hell yea!
rhett is Jason at the end of the super bowl commercial he did last year.
This video got a like just for the idea
How does Link get dragged into everything Rhett does? also Rhett's wife should really appreciate this
Watching Link pose Rhett gives me flashbacks to the recent barbie/snape kiss
I'm sorry Link but Rhett I'd absolutely fine!!!😍😘😗
the best way to bring back the vlogs
"What is the objective?" "It's to make her want me."
I know you told Jessie not to read the comments BUT I LOVE HER! She is an absolute gem in this and I hope she gets a birthday puppy to round out this amazing gift.
I think Jessie is my new celebrity crush
😂😂😂😂🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
@prideofgypsies you have to see this!! True love!!!  Rhett and Link you're the best!! Such a great gift!!  #jasonmomoa
"More cow bell" 😂💀
Happy Birthday Jessie!! ✨🥰 this was definitely worth the wait!!! ❤️can’t wait for more vlogs!
Link had jokes on this one 🤣
Hilarious
I LOVE JESSIE SO MUCH.
Amazing!!
That tribe called quest record 👌
This was great! Thanks for the video, guys, and Happy Birthday to Jessie!
New vlog makes man happy
MORE COWBELL!!!!
More Jenna please!!
Happy Birthday Jessie!  Thanks for making it a fun vlog for us to enjoy.  I really appreciate the fact that you both decided to take a break from it and only post when you really felt it was time to do one...so much better than forcing it, and this one was such a treat.
Epic gift! You all did A great job for Jessie's birthday present. Can't wait to see Links transformation into Urban!
In all fairness, we've never seen Rhett and Momoa in the same room together... 🤔
9:29  Can that be a meme?
My name's Jessie, its not my birthday but i'll accept greetings
I was starting to worry there would be no more vlog. I love them.  So happy to see it again
I know your wives (understandably!) always like being in screen, so I must say happy birthday Jessie, & thank you for letting us share this with you it brought a smile to my face this morning!
Jessie is on camera!
Woweee! Jessie, you lucky girl! Happy Birthday.
Link's little giggle before saying "Keith Urban" 💀💀 3:10
This makes me so happy to see the R&L Channel going.
I appreciate Jenna's hard work and creativity for this. But I wish I could do the part where she hosed Rhett with water.
Anyone notice that red had red lines because he must have been allergic to the pain on his chest :((((   Also happy birthday Jessie!!
This is hilarious and precious at the same time and I love it. Happy birthday to Jessie!!
Worth the wait
You can take the girl out of the Carolina's...
when rhett and jessie got to talking, i immediately felt like a third wheel 😂. they are such a lovely couple ♥️
The real reason Rhett has been growing out his hair
I think we need a Rhett Momoa X Klink Urban calendar
Link is nailing the Luigi costume.
Perfection🤌
Please create a subchannel based solely on U2 duplicating looks. I wasn't expecting this, but it was so freaking entertaining. Happy Bday 🎉🎂
I’m at the part of wet Momoa and I’m laughing so much
“Do to me as you please” whoa there Rhett I know your friends are getting older but wow
YAAAYYYYY I MISSED THE VLOGS
4:37 he looks like the Geico Caveman which imo isn't a bad thing
Happy birthday Jessie!!!
Lol how sweet Rhett went way out there for Jessie's gift such a cute a funny moment happy birthday Jessie 🎂
Now we know why Rhett's been growing out his hair! lol
Link....he's not Marvel, he's DC...
damn, Jenna got cake
When did you start showing your wives on your videos? :O
Worth the wait
This was a surprise and it was amazing. XD
This made me so happy.  I thought we weren't getting anymore, yay!  Happy Birthday Jessie!
link i'm sorry but i have to encourage this
I love this video but you should really be wearing masks for your employee's safety too..
I have missed Saturday Vlogs SOOO much!
This was pure gold. I haven't laughed and enjoyed a video this much in a long time. The conversation between Rhett and Link at the beginning was difficult to even hear cause I was laughing too hard
Jessie and Christy have such loving husbands - total relationship goals... *plus, Jason Mamoa is freaking HOT and loves his wife so much as well*
You won’t believe how fast I clicked when I saw the notification for a new vlog
I searched it up and Rhett is actually a little bit taller that Jason Momoa
"Aqua makes man happy"  -Rhett, 2021
Not to be dramatic but i would die for jessie
"Make all your muscles bigger."  "...hunnnnnghhhmmm."
I went to high school with JASON MOMOA!!!!  He was 2 years below me but was in my wifes grade!   Nice kid from what i can remember.  I wonder if my year book with him in it is worth anything????????????????????????????????????????????
MyLoveMuffin sent this to me, and it’s amazing. However, I’m really pretty happy that my extreme white male partner in no way could pull off my celeb hall pass(es) - I have 2, who both happen to be close with JM.
I think Rhett and Link look better than Jason Momoa.
Link is jealous that Rhett is dressed lil jason
Jessie I hope you're keeping that self care up and not reading the comments, but if you are i hope you know you are a lovely, beautiful, kind hearted person and thankyou for gracing us with your screen presence
I'm wholeheartedly encouraging Rhett in the comment section. Also happy B-day Jess!!!
I seriously love these vlogs. ♥️♥️
Jessie is just a smile incarnate! Aww ❤️
I forgot rhetts teeth just disappear when he smiles
JESSIE IF YOU ARE READING THE COMMENTS HELLO FROM TWITTER :) we luv u
I read this as “Rhett and Link become Jason Momoa and his wife“ and full on thought that Link was going to become Lisa Bonet. 😂😂
Keith Urban 😂
I have missed the vlogs so much and this one was perfection! I laughed and smiled the entire time! Jessie is the cutest!
The next vlog needs to be Jessie meeting Jason Momoa
jessie is my favorite person in the mythical universe. her twitter presence is unmatched. happy birthday jessie!
Rhett's wife is so southern I love it! She's also stunning.
lol link needs his own photoshoot
Rhett momoa has a ring to it
The chat between you and link at the start is natural and witty 😁 genuine laughs always make me laugh too
Rhett McMomoa 🤤 it was my birthday on the 9th so this is my present too 😆
I love how he slowly dies inside 🤣
That was so sweet that Rhett went to those lengths for Jessie's birthday! What a great way to show he cares. <3
Not me jumping up and down because not only was this unexpected but it opens with, Jessie !!!!!!  I follow her on twitter, shes amazing!!!
Thank you, Link, for helping Rhett make a thirst trap video. 😍🤣😂🤣
Rhett is far more attractive than Jason
Rhett McMomoa....... mmmmm yes daddy!
I'm so glad theyve finally made another one, I almost thought they were never coming back
happy birthday jessie🥳
Yay!!! This made my Saturday!!!!!
Yay for the vlogs!
So much laughter!
I love this! Thank you so much for the joy! 😂
Jessie’s so pretty, Happy Birthday Jessie!!
Damn Rhett lol loved the video you've got to get Link to cosplay Keith Urban...
Sorry link I’m here to encourage because 😍🥴
I love this lol
so sweeet!!! I'm sure you went with long hair just for your wife!!!
Duude I jump for joy when I see new stuff on this legendary channel
Is this my birthday?  I don't recall.
Dang Rhett. Your wife is a lucky gal. Jason Momoa who?
We want more vlog style videos
I think these vlogs are awesome but you guys should do them when you feel like it you guys are actually funny
What a creative & sweet present! ♡ Thanks for sharing this video with us!
I honestly like these videos on this page more than GMM. They’re more fun.
I MISSED THESE VLOGS
“A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one”
FINALLY
Finally!!! Love the vlogs link and rhason!
Rhett is the definition of Jason Momoa 😱
I like to the Rhett is Jason Momoa’s wife’s hall pass
I love this format you guys should go out more its soooo refreshinggg
Omg I was laughing so hard! This was great!
Everyone needs to spam Jasons twitter with a link to this video.
This is incredible.  Also reminds me how incredibly lonely I am.
standing next to a swimming pool.... "I have an idea! lets use the freezing cold hose!" "yes! love that!"
YES. MORE VLOGS <3
Wait. Your wife on camera? I thought that was the one rule
The thought of a "hall pass" is idiotic and disgusting. Also, you should be the person your wife finds sexiest. This is just the worst.
I love this
Jenna is beautiful and adorable
I love this because you can tell that Jessie has a type
This was amazing. So glad to see a vlog again
This is the best episode ever
YESSSSSS!!! The vlogs are back!!!
hmmmm i wonder why the ending was so abrupt...lol
yyaaaayayay another post to this channel
Who else can agree that Jessie McLaughlin is so insanely beautiful?!😍 I see why Rhett has been so in love with her all this time. This was a huge step for Jessie after never being on camera all this time. Jessie, thank you so much for doing this! It was a pleasure to see your beautiful self💜💜
Jenna
Can you imagine the role-playing they had that night lol
It's been SO LONG since we got a vlog upload from the guys and I can definitively say that this was worth the wait.
This is amazing!! Great job guys
Cute
Jemma always so darn cute
I’m so glad your wife accepted to be in a video!
Wait are the vlogs coming back?
I've been missing the vlog!
That is so sweet you must love your wife❤️ happy birthday Jessie and link your such a great friend to help.
Oh, I'm Encouraging Rhett to take pics of Link as Keith Urban Thanks for this, fellas
Can we just talk about how insanely multi talented Jenna is?
The fact that they didn’t recreate the Jason Momoa sneaking up on Henry Cavill meme picture with Link as Henry makes me very sad
I miss these vlogs.
Did Rhett have an allergic reaction to that paint? I feel like I can still see the stripes on his shoulders...
I’m sorry Link.. but I’m pretty sure Jason Mamoa is the closest celebrity crush to Rhett himself. Like she definitely has a type lol
That was fun!! smart idea Rhett
Link is such a great friend. He’s always looking out for Rhett and still supporting him.   Also, that assistant is AMAZING! You go girl!
This was not worth the wait, but it was also 100% worth the wait. Keep it up, guys.  We need SOMEthing to keep us going in 2021.
Tell me saturday vlogs are back. Please this is great news
Don't show me the hole.  That's why I've got the towel.  😂😂😂
This most certainly was a thirst trap video.
Jessie is way more beautiful than I imagined, I was going by her blurred face though so didn't have much to go on.
finally a video 😪😂😂 now i can say that rhett is not made for modeling 😂😂😂
My face hurts from laughing 🤣
Aww her reaction to Rhett in these pics was adorable! Love it!
Best husband ever!  We now expect you to return the favor and Link does Keith Urban.
THIS CHANNEL IS BACK??? EEEEE I MISSED THE VLOGS
Awww we get to see the lovely Miss Jessie!
Now THIS is a comeback!!!
Just like the time Kozmo Kramer photographed George Costanza. 😄
Ok after the wet hair flip this TOTALLY became a thirst trap...happy belated birthday Jessie!!!!  That book was very sweet and Jessie and her reaction were just adorable.  You two are so cute together ❤️
Well I got a hose, beside a pool lol
So happy to see another video on this channel!
Yayy! The vlogs are back swinging!
"Be happy" "I can't be happy like this" Lol
Can't believe Jessie appeared in a video
So this is why Rhett grew his hair out... it all make sense now.
So, what I have been missing all those weeks was you guys's videos. This was amazing and also cute at the same time.
I missed these vlogs!
If I didn't have a crush on Rhett before....
I can’t wait until they do Link Urban!
WAIT THE VLOGS ARE BACK OMG!!!! 🥳
Woah idk if I've ever seen Jessie before, SHE'S SO PRETTTTTTY!!!
This is like that commercial where Jason Momoa takes his muscles off.
He's strong
If Jason Momoa had a dad bod.
Rhett with his hair down just reminds me of Encino man every time I see it
What an awesome Saturday morning surprise!
I'm not here to encourage Rhett (which i do) but to REQUIRE that Link do this Keith urban style for his wife's birthday
i was smiling throughout the entire video
If Momoa was allergic to the sun and on a crack binge
ayee Rhett Momoa
Can we have a round of applause for Link's dual-wielded photography and videography skills, an artistic king
Rhett played it off well - but Link called it - Rhett is trying to thirst trap his wife.
11:14 Wet Momoa? Missed opportunity to say "Wet McLaughlin" 😅
This is fantastic 😂
A new vlog?! 🙌
Best video ever! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Was this the real reason for the hair and beard? Also, Jenna needs a raise, lol.
They need to recreate that Home Depot ad now 👀
Omg yes, so excited for this video
KEITH URBAN LMAO
Link: Don't encourage him in the comments. Ok... Rhett: *Wants to look like Jason Momoa* Also Rhett: *Looks like a young Kenny Loggins*
I’m very glad we got to be a part of this
THE MOST LEGENDARY CHANNEL OF YOUTUBE IS BACK
That was amazing.
After watching the entire video, I now understand how Link feels.
I missed these so much!
Link is the best photographer of all time
That was the most wholesome thing 🤣 also if link does Keith urban... 🤣🤣🤣🤣I don’t even know
why is jason mamoa recreating photos of himself i don't get it
THE COMEBACK
A VLOG!! What a great Saturday morning surprise. Thank you!
💚💛💚
this is adorable.
I was just thinking its a shame they don't upload vlogs
Personally, I think Rhett is a hell of a lot sexier than Jason Momoa!
HORSE FLESH
Jenna did a great job with wardrobe & make up.  Props to her & the costuming department.
This is content.
Oh I’m cringing already and I haven’t even started the video 😂😂😂 Hilarious!
LOL
Shes a great wife omg I would love to meet a woman as close to as supportive as her 💗
Now we get the hair.
Happy Birthday Jessie! 🙂🎂💪🐉
Jessie seems like such a sweet lady
They should've gave him a fan so his pink shirt could float in the wind 😅
Amazing!!! My fiancé and I couldn’t stop laughing!
You look like Rhett and I adore you just the way you are! Even when you are pretending to be Aquaman... who I get why people think is sexy, but he doesnt quite do it for me.
That was worth the wait.
Jason Momoa is also my celebrity hall pass lol but after watching this I do not know. I am in tears lol
“that goes well and it happens often” lmaoooooo
FINALLY these are back. Keep em coming !
Rhett cosplaying as Khal Drogo is the 2021 gift I desperately needed.   Relatedly, “more cowbell” is a 21 year old reference I didn’t realize I wanted. 😂
You know, it really was worth the wait.
Wait, was this the entire reason he grew out the beard and hair?! 😂
Happy Birthday Jessie!!!!!! You are so beautiful it’s radiant! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Honestly, the effort you put into this gift.. unmatched! That's what you should be proud of! There's plenty of tall bearded men walking around that could do this, but they DON'T! lol great effort rhett, and link lol. And assistant, and zack who edited the pics. Great job guys!
SMH lol
Well this just made my Saturday morning. Thank you.
Find someone that looks at you like Rhett looks at McMomoa
Damn Rhett your a lucky guy she’s hot
Lisa Bonet’s Celebrity Hall Pass is Rhett
Link:"...Keith Urban"  hahahahahaahahaha oh man laughed so hard
I'm impressed with Link's ability to be a director during a photo shoot.  Also, Jessie is a lucky woman!  Happy Birthday, Jessie!!
I knew this would be a treat as soon as i saw the title
Rhett is a spitting image of Jason momoa
Jessie is so sweet and beautiful! Happy birthday!
😆 “Ok, you said ‘pipe’ three too many times. Go and get changed.“  Literally lol’ed on that one. 😆
i did this same idea but with album covers! that third outfit was really nice on rhett, not gonna lie lol
I've waited so long for another one of these 😂
This explains so much and probably more than I really wanted to know 🤔🤨😶
THIS CHANNEL IS BACK!!!  ( edit: yes, the wait was very much worth it, thank you guys <3 )
This is amazing! Hahaha I hope they do Link as Keith for Christy! Lol 😂😂
Just realized their outro is a snippet of “My OCD”
haven't laugh this hard for a longggg time.. thanks mannn, I needed it... LMAO
This is awk
So now we know the real reason Rhett grew his hair out. For Jessie. Sweet!
This was so great. At 10:46 "make all of your muscles bigger" it cracked me up!!! 🤣🤣🤣 And then he tried Lol!! Such an adorable pair
The vlogs are back(at least for now) woohoo
That pink outfit was 100% Rhett. If not authentically, then something he would choose for a long skit. Maybe without the glasses.   Link's half-compliments and straight up roasts are so appreciated though. I almost said Rhett looked great. Crisis averted
this is hard to watch with the assistant wearing a mask...
Hey mom can we have Aquaman? We have Aquaman at home.  Aquaman at home:
Completely caught off guard by this video but totally nailed Mcmomoa!
I needed this today ❤️
Hahahaha
NEW VIDEO! YES!!
This is true love 😂😂
Damn rhett you know how to pick em
I love how absolutely frustrated Link is in this vlog lol
I’m not complaining about wet Rhett moma
My husband and I have the same hall pass 🤣
So just now I found out that Jenna and I have the same profession!!! I too, am a Jason Momoa expert!!😌
Happy Birthday Jessie!
I love this so much 🤣 now time to get Link to be Keith Urban for Christy. 🙌
That was adorable 😆
"You need to be genuinely happy" Rhett: c:
is link okay 😂
Mamoa-sa 🍹
Ok Link, now you gotta top Rhett’s birthday present to Jessie with your birthday present for Christie!
I think I like Rhett better
Love u guys, but if someone’s wearing a mask, they probably want u to wear a mask too.
YES! So glad this is back
You are most definitely incorrect Link. Everyone I know thinks Jason Momoa is pretty.
Oh bless Jenna 🥺 going to all that effort hand making the necklace and the cone
Link walks in * “Tell me about this project “
That is an incredibly thoughtful gift!
It makes perfect sense why Rhett really grew his hair out now.
Aww I missed these!!
I love these vlogs and y'all said y'all would do this every Saturday !
Lol while entertaining,and glad we got to be a part of this,this is sweet in a way,happy birthday to Jessie.
Appreciate jenna's work
Rhett, you're a great husband. This video was quite the sight to see! 🧐
Rhett is slowly turning into damnyell and no one can stop him
This is gold
love love love those kind of videos!!!!
Link said "what do you think about Jason Mamoa, he's not pretty to everybody". Link you are a foolish man. And a liar
That’s so sweet what he did for his wife.
Ayeeee the vlogs are back!
"Are you asking me to participate in a thirst trap video?"  HAHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHA
This is SO CUTE and I loved it.  Link did so well despite hating it 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 May we all be blessed with partners who will go through so much for us
I really want Jason Momoa to react to this xD
I’m with link on this one
Okay, this was cute
I did not expect to be greeted with a video of the queen this morning but alas 😭❤️
Love these vlogs
😂
Rhett is starting to look more and more like Damnyell every day.
Rhett does look like the type that has a major ego on him.
Such a cute gift idea 😂
Is the next video gonna be link dressing up as rachel Maddow for his wife’s birthday?
I love when you guys do stuff like this out of the office!❤️
Your wife has great taste!  😬
Never thought we’d see either of their wives on camera. Glad to see the vlogs are back!
"Aquaman, Aqua makes man happy"
Is everyone beyond excited to see Jessie on here!?
😂🤣☠️
These vlogs are my favvvvv
"Why am I involved.....Why are they involved?"  Thank you Link....I want to know this to 🤣
I was sad because it was Saturday, which means no gmm but now I’m not😂
I didn't even realize how long I've been waiting for these vlogs to come back...
Loved it! Sooo worth the wait! Keep 'em comin' (only when you want to, no pressure)! ;)
all the fuss of growing his mane just to make her wife wants him, what a gentleman
Link is hilarious. And Jenna rocks
Wondering what the neighbors think lol
I have been waiting sooooo long for a new one because I love these....thanks so much guys!!!!
I love that both of these men, 20 years on, still want their wives to want them. That's awesome. ♥️♥️♥️♥️
Okay but he kinda pulls it off
I love this video so much 😂😂
Weirdest foreplay I've ever seen.
Ahhhhhhhh!  Vlogs!!!!!!  Woo hoo!!!!!!!
This video was unexpected but not unwelcome. Happy birthday Jessie!
Wetting a t shirt with a hose...you know there's a pool right?
The more cowbell got me
I'm so happy they finally released another vlog!!!
Wonder what would happen if you asked her to dress like Scarlett Johansson
You guys have outdone yourselves🥰
I'm so glad the vlogs are back, they've become some of my favorite content y'all produce
why does link know what a thirst trap is
Was so excited and surprised to see a new vlog after so long but man this did not disappoint so freaking funny! I’ve missed these!
I love both marvel and dc
Everyone talking about Jessie's face on camera while I'm still surprised that Link has shorter hair than Rhett
Definitely worth the wait😂
What a legend Rhett is
Link knocked and opened, no waiting lol.
Omg I'm dying 🤣😂🤣😂🤣
I miss the vlogs!
jessie nation how we feelin???? 🧡🧡🧡
This was the funniest video they put up recently, I was rolling the entire time 😂
Best vlog to date!
I don't think my husband will be making a book of himself as Link but I can dream...
Rhett looks hot I'm not gonna lie! 😂
Why is your employee wearing a mask but you guys are not? :(
these are always my fave videos!!
Jessie😍😍😍
Uhm… Jenna wearing a mask while R&L are not around her.... 😳🤨
I loved everything about this! ❤❤❤
THIS is awesome!!!! 🔥🔥🔥
Yea they definitely went hard in the paint as soon as the camera turned off lmao.
How do 37 people not think this was such a sweet gesture, so full of humor?  You da man Rhett!
They haven’t posted on this channel for so long
I love your weekend VLOGS,  thanks for bringing them back.
Not to encourage Rhett's ego, but Jessie is one lucky lady (who most definitely deserved this).
Didn’t expect this!! So excited they added to the channel.
I think Rhett is better looking bc Jason is just too pretty! I like a real man!
Can we make a go fund me to get Jason momoa on gmm?
I just hope that their kids don't ever see this
Yayyayayayayayyaya Jessie
I'm just here to encourage him in the comments. 🧜‍♂️
5:04 i just then noticed how link is dressed and i couldn't look away
I wish my hubby would go through this much effort for me. Last year I didn't even get a birthday present 😭
And the award for best husband goes to Rhett! His wife looks so happy
Woah........Jessie on camera!!!!!!!! IT FEELS ILLEGAL
Its so great to see you guys doing vlogs again:3
JESSE ON CAMERA?! PRAISE THE MYTHICAL GODS
FINALLY! I miss Rhett and Link on Saturdays.
The white t shirt pic at the end, looks like a  happy homeless guy who just got a meal.
Man tries to get his wife to love him again
YES YES YES
YAY
That explains why Rhett was growing hair
Jessie reveal?!
I missed the vlogs so much
Yesssssssssss. I miss the clogs so much. Please keep making them!
OH MY, THANK YOU for making my day!    Rhett, the photos are amazing, but you are sexier then Jason!!
This is me encouraging Rhett in the comments
Link is such a great director!
Somewhere out there, there are wives who's celebrity hall pass is Rhett McLaughlin
🤣🤣🤣 Classic "More cowbell!!"
OMG ITS BEEN SO LONG SINCE A VLOG. Also HI JESSIE!! YOU ARE WONDERFUL 😁😁 Edit: It was definitely worth the wait 😂
He’s pretty to me too!
I never clicked so fast.
THIS IS SO CUTE I NEED THE LINK VERSION ASAP
Ain’t know Rhett was married to an absolute smoke show 👀😳
I love your vlogs!! Jessie is adorable ❤❤
Sweet gesture on Rhett's part for his wife.....but so NOT a look a like.
I’m so glad the vlogs are back!
I appreciate the vlog being back, and the video was fun and all... But let's give it up for the real star: Jenna in those jeans! *DAMN!* Makes me wanna stop, drop, and roll that's how hot she is! She's the real Momoa of this episode!
Did everyone just skip over the fact that this was said??.... don’t show me the hole.. don’t show me the hole? That’s why I have the towel
Jessie’s laugh is really adorable 😊
“I’m a marvel guy” finally link is useful
Wait why does the pink outfit work so well??
I'm waiting for Link's Keith Urban version
Is Jenna also from Tennessee? Emily & Jenna are now bae twins.
I love everything about this video, especially Link’s role.
This is just sad.
Awesome gift
It’s been a long time since we got something from this channel.
"Well I don't always"
so, SO glad the vlogs are back. big, big, and sincere thanks to you two for doing this despite everything going on. my wife and I always look forward to this sort of content, and I am super appreciative.   PS - if your wife's hall pass is essentially you after a six-month clean bulk with some cardio stacked and a few tattoos, your marriage must be kicking some serious ass!   Rhett for Aquaman 2022
Its so amazing seeing rhett and jessie together. Honestly surreal seeing that side of rhett. He's like a shy school boy
This is so fuckin wholesome🥺
I love when link says to smile big and all that changes is the corners of rhetts mustache go up
Jessie is honestly one of the most beautiful women I’ve seen !!
Their assistant is the real hero here, she did a great job 👏🏿👏🏿
I just can’t imagine link in the act of laying 😂
Link brought his A game for this one
So happy these vlogs are back!!!
2021 youtube has peaked and it's only January
Aw, this is so adorable!
"Are you asking me to participate in a thirst trap video!?"
The last look Rhett gave the camera, is one of a man who is about to lay with his wife.
Oh...THIS is why Rhett really grew his hair out
Now we know why Rhett is growing out his hair and beard 😂
Is THIS why he grew out his hair?
A petition for Jason Momoa to actually show up at their anniversary
Oh I know what happened after this video. Oh I KNOW
It seems like Jessie definitely has a type lol
We need Momoa these vlogs!
This was everything!!!!
Okay but Rhett dressed as Khal Drogo... 😍 Jessie is a lucky lucky lady!
The quality content we came here for
The moment when Link was helping Rhett smile with his finger... I was laughing so hard
Hilarious lol
Hilarious guys. So happy the vlog is back.
The best part is how happy Rhett's wife Jessie was after getting that gift!
There I was making lunch and reminiscing Saturday R&L vlogs and then – what a surprise!
Made me think he was trying to steal jason momoa's wife
That was funny. Now let's see Link as Kieth Urban
What a comeback!
We need more Jenna! Also, East Tennesseean here and I love her TN Vols mask! 🧡
Yess worth the wait.
This was awesome.
Yess worth the wait.
This might be my favorite video of theirs yet
Alright you said pipe..three.. too many times lol
Marriage goals!!!!  These two are so adorable together ♥️♥️♥️
.....why is a thirst trap video (an effective thirst trap video, I might add, were I not explicitly instructed to not encourage Rhett) ultimately so wholesome and about spousal love?? lol #hubbiegoals
Too cute to be true!!! 😍😍😍😍😍
Hilarious!
Now I want a Aquaman shirt 😬
Having watched more of the video. Link is super salty because Rhett is crushing it. 🧂
A) I love Jessie so much and B) this made me smile a lot. Worth the wait!
I think you already look a bit like him, just more blonde and less tanned. I'm sure the muscles don't matter. I feel like he's a bit rustic, I'm more for Chris Pratt. Also, if Chris pratt had a beard in passengers.
Rhett, your wife your beautiful!!!
"We only lay each other, and that goes well, and it happens often." 😂 #CarefreeVasectomyLife
I'm so glad you guys are back!
Best. Day. Ever.
Awww!  This was such a great video to return to the vlogs!!  Rhett and his wife are so super cute together 💕. More wholesome cuteness like this please ❤️
This is so cute
Your assistant is hot as hell. 😳
I like how link is wearing all green
*I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THESE WEEKEND RHETT AND LINK VIDEO VLOGS!!!! THEY'RE MY FAVORITE! I'VE MISSED THEM SO MUCH AND I HOPE THEY'RE BACK FOR THE LONG RUN!* 🙌🙌🙌🙌
It’s cute that their passes aren’t much far off from their actual husbands
14:45 "It ain't about Mom, it's about Daddy" ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Definitely worth the wait. 💗💗
To make it look better you should've colour your hair black and the beard
I almost never comment on videos but this was amazing. I was laughing so much. Needed this blog today!
THE BLOGS ARE BACK BAYBEEEEE
Link 2021 more cow bell classic
Yaaay so happy their blogging again!!
This was awesome!!!
If Links wifes celebrity pass was Rachel Maddow, they'd be set.
Rhett and link are so cute in this video
I'm in love with that cactus
Pink pajama Rhett looks like his Buddy System self.
Rhett needs to bulk up
I LOVE Jessie. Shes so cute.
The vlogs on Saturday back ?
Jenna being the real MVP of the vlog 😷
That is my wife’s celebrity hall pass too.
So this what happiness looks like, huh?       Never heard of it
WE LOVE YOU JESSIE!! ♥️♥️♥️
Ooooh, an unexpected video!
Ohh so that’s why Rhett started growing everything out
i really miss Rhett's short hair...
Rhett's wife is so cute
I think it was cute and a funny present XD thanks for letting us in the fun too XDDD
Rhett was pinching his shirt like hes pinching a nipple
I love it.
The Editer who forgot to blur Rhett's wife's face 👉🗣️
I want these more than gmm episodes!!!
I cried, this was too sweet, the best gift ever!!!!
Jessie seems so fun! I wish she'd do more videos.  And this was HILARIOUS!
This was really sweet.
Rhett and Link have gotten so much hornier
Rhett seems to be way more interested in Links wife then his own.
Yay! I've missed these Saturday videos!
Wow, this started my day off with some quality laughs, thanks guys lol
As early as I can be!!
Hahahahahahahahahaha
The pink outfit is a vibe.
Jessie is so beautiful and adorable!
I literally was thinking this morning in the shower "it's been way too long since they did that Saturday vlog thing"
Thinking of the perfect comment but I just have to many great things to say. Everything you guys put out for us is amazing. Thank you for this. Just, THANK YOU!
I really want to read what Jenna's job description says 🤣🤣🤣
I did not expect to wake up to see the return of THE TWO MAN VLOG!  I seriously thought that endeavor would just be lost to 2020.
Rhett: “Who’s her celebrity hall pass?” Link: “...Keith Urban.” All of us: “Bahahahahaha!” Why is that so funny? 😂
Your wife is really into bearded long-haired dudes huh?
The real MVP of this project was Zach the photo editor!
Nice
Link is a surprisingly great photographer!
LINK: dont encourage him   ME: encourage encourage encourage!!!!
This was indeed worth the wait
Rhett is sexiest when he's just being him, not Jason Momoa.
Rhett needs no encouragement Link.... 😂
I WASNT EXPECTING A VLOG. YAYYYY!!
That is most sad and pathetick thing i have seen, if you need to do that there is something realy wrong u can be pirat policemen whatever but if that what you pretend to be has real name and surname...
More vlogs!!!!
When you order Jason Momoa from Wish!
Rhett...I am encouraging you...in the comments:)
I’m so glad to see this series back I hope it doesn’t go away
Yay! The Rhett and Link videos have returned. Well at least one!
Yess. The vlogs are back!
Hairline gooone
This is the BEST thing I've ever seen!  Are there like, copies we can buy, or...? 😅
Damn your assistant has a banging body
Her accent is adorable
I LOVE VLOGS! SO GLAG THEY ARE BACK!
Seriously? Who were the 28 people (as of writing this) to give this a thumbs down?!
Yaaaasssssss rhett and link vlogs!😂
Well this is a nice surprise!
Can't wait to see Link turned into Keith Urban.
When link giggled and said “tehe Keith Urban” I LAUGHED OUT LOUD.
Worth the wait was an understatement, happy birthday Jessie 🎈
Rhett, what a blessed family you have, awesome, funny and beautiful wife! Keep up with the awesome work and wonderful family.
it’s back!! i’m glad y’all got the break but wow i missed these
So are we going to dress Link up like Keith Urban?
I haven't laughed this hard in 2021. Man, I really missed y'all vlogs.
You're my celebrity pass rhett
Who else thought this channel was dead again
Vlogs are back! Let’s talk about that!
There's Link's attention to details
These videos are my favorite thing they have ever done
Absolutely adorable! Jessie obviously loved it, so cute
Rhett is so much more sexier !!
But is it just me, or the new gmm season and this vlog have become more grown up? I feel like they are more free to use words and ideas that they would not use before because of the younger audience Not saying that i mind that, just wonder if its just me
Never felt so attracted to a man before
Five minutes in I cant stop cracking up.
Rhett looks like the version of Jason Momoa from the commercials when he comes home & takes off all his musical
i never knew Rhett was romantic😂😂 thats adorable😂
That was beautiful. 🥰
This is my favorite thing about 2021 so far
We truly have been blessed amen
Gift time for Christy? 👀
You had to wet the hair and it would have been almost the same hair
I’m confused.. did Link made a collab with Jason Momoa?? Where’s Rhett?
I was just wishing they'd do 2 man vlogs again! 😁
OMG.. so funny but so so sweet.. happy birthday jessie! ☺️
I am dead, I love this vlog 😍
I'd take Rhett over Jason. I'm in the 3% who doesn't find Jason Mamoa attractive...
jessie is cute and hilarious
THEYRE BACK
The fact you didn't sleep with her while dressed as him makes the whole gesture futile.
great video! your wife is so adorable!!
Actl rhett is such a handsome boi
What's actually crazy jason looks more like Rhett since Rhett is older
Rhett b links wife made them look like their hall passes already
Why is she wearing a mask but the guys aren't? Kinda pointless isn't it?
Happy Birthday!
When did they start showing their wives faces.
This is the weirdest video I’ve intentionally clicked on in a long time...
I think "The Dude" is a better match for Rhett
Jessie is an absolute treasure to this earth and we must protect her at all costs 😭😭💖💖
How do Jenna's jeans fit so exactly and precisely? How is it physically possible for her to put them on? Our current understanding of physics can not account for this.
I’m so glad these are back!!!
So sweet
The whole Red Pill and MGTOW community would like a word with you, young man.
Yay 2 man vlogs are back!
“I got this photo 😮🤙 and I got this photo 😲🤙”
Why did they wet the T-Shirt with the hose when they have a fricking pool right there? It's way faster xD
Talking about hall passes I see
Rhett is a handsome guy but I really doubt if Lisa Bonet would make her husband dress up as Rhett 🤣🤣🤣
CUUTTTEEEE
I’m in bed with Covid and this is the best surprise ever! Xx
This is so funny, cute, and sexy at the same time. ❤️
Does Anyone know if Jenna’s mask represents Tennessee?
We constantly lay each other , spooky fanfic memories😵
I’ve been waiting for this day to come. I love this channel
McMomoa I’d say was a success!
This was so entertaining! One of my favorite vlogs and Rhett that was such an awesome gift
I thought he's actually gonna paint his body and do the hair and a costume appear in front of her. But photos work as well
Me: can we go get jason momoa  Mom: we got Jason momoa at home  Jason momoa at home :  Nice
This makes me happy. Rhett wanting to make Jessie happy, Jessie being happy and laughing, Link roasting the absolute crap out of Rhett and saying thirst trap multiple times, all of it 😂😂
Yeeeeeessssss, they have returned, the vlogs are back baby, woooooo
My face hurts from laughing xD
Rhett could do with some more muscles 😂
My all time favorite episode!  Honestly they’re both pretty hot.  Just sayin...
I kinda forgot they bought that house/work space
“This isn’t about being beautiful. This about looking like Jason Momoa.” ...Are those not the same thing?
we get to see his wife?
so is link gonna be maddow?
2:21 "depends on how thirsty someone is."  Me at that exact moment: *"SHluRP"*
Wait... where’s the blur?
Aqua makes man happy  I love the assistant in this so much and Link’s little sarcastic zings.  Happy birthday Jessie! She’s so ooooo beautiful!
Haha
Great come back vid
Awesome job they’d to surprise  your while .
That rocked so much Rhett ur awesome 🤩, stay safe love from Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿💋💜
Link: I'm a marvel guy... DC: I need a senzu bean...
A VLOGGGG FINALLYY!!
now we need to make link look like keith urban
Why doesn’t he have teeth lmao
I feel like there's a connection between Jessie liking Jason Momoa and Rhett growing out his hair
I like link more now cuz "I'm a marvel guy"
Now we just need to have link do something for  his wife that he’s comfortable showing 17 million people.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
JESSIE IS ON CAMERA THIS IS AMAZING!!!!! WE LOVE JESSIE MORE JESSIE!!!!!!
There aren’t many things that make me genuinely smile these days but I was totally grinning watching this whole video.
That was worth the wait
Omg! What a nice surprise to see this morning!   Tourist trap video 😂 😂 😂   “Depends on how thirsty someone is.”
What a great start to a Saturday!!
VLOG IS BACK
Vlogggggg! Omg yes thank you 😊
Best episode in a long time for gmm. Keep on doing the vlogs please guys
Jessie is so wholesome, it's hard not to love heeer
Lmao that's a huge cone
I'm sorry that laugh at the beginning got me dying xD
Damn
Um that pink outfit on Rhett 😳
The kind of content I signed up for 😁
This was worth the wait!
YES IT'S BACK!
This video has given me all the serotonin my lonely, single, depressed self needed for the month. I will now request monthly McMamoa video efforts, and maybe a Link as Keith Urban special. That is all.
THEY'RE BAAAAAACK😎😎😎😎
Great job Rhett. I love those one-of-a-kind gifts.
Wait... isn't wives on camera against the law?
This was fantastic! I've learned that Rhett is actually quite photogenic, but what I already knew is that Jessie is all kinds of adorable.
Haha! Best vlog ever! And a very thoughtful gift!
Ok Link I won't praise Rhett but I will just say that Jessie is a fantastic sport and a beautiful woman. And your a great friend for agreeing to to this for Rhett. 🤗
Holy cow I was just thinking about how long you have been on youtube and yet your wives never made an appearance. Happy to see you smiling together, thanks for keeping us beasts entertained despite the pandemic :)
Ah yes take the boudoir photobook gift idea, and make it.... hairy.
This was awesome. So much fun!! Pleeeaaaase do more Rhett & Link Vlogs 🙏🏻
The only thing I like of this vlog it’s Link as the photographer....Plus, we seriously need a 2nd MYTHICAL HOUSE TOUR vlog....
Jenna is the real hero here😂😂😂
I missed this so much
I really hope they write down their password in the future
Give your assistant a raise!
I believe my thirst has been trapped.
I'm so glad Rhett let us in on this venture. This was a lot of fun!
LOL i think rhett looks like a red head jason mamoa anyways
i loved this 😭😭😂😂❤️❤️❤️
This was hilarious
Rhett I don’t encourage this....  I 100 love it though!
Finally this channel post something!! 👍
Can we get Rhett to do Viking photoshoots??
VLOGS ARE BACK 😩😩😩😩
Aqua makes man happy
Jason Mamoa who?
Now do this for Links wife but Link as different versions of Velma Dinkley from Scooby Doo. :)
All I got to say is that the assistant is adorable
Sorry link Rhett pulled this off way too well. Aqua man was my favorite
Its been so long this channel is back woooo
One of the best gifts ever given, well done Rhett (and Link)
Ngl rhett wasn't too far off to start. His wife definitely got a type😂
Someone’s gotta teach link the difference between a smile and a smolder 😂
yes these are back! I'm so happy!
Jessie's face when he said "it ain't about mom, it's about daddy" 🥺💀💀💀
I know you all don’t want to do this regularly but perhaps reconsider a few more.  These are great!
Oh snap, next have Link as Toby Maguire's Spiderman! ....wait maybe Andrew Garfield's cuz hair.
darn, i missed yall vlogs
Oh, how i have missed these vlogs!!!! Great content!
"I don't love what this might be doing for his ego" 🤣
The blogs are back and they're better than ever!
What would've been hilarious is if when Rhett was reminding link in the beginning of the video that their doing this for Rhett s wife birthday so don't tell her and link acts like he's telling her.
That's a very sweet thing Rhett did for Jessie.
She’s on camera?!
Rhett really is a streamlined Jason Momoa, oh sorry Link......I take it back 😬
"Can I keep it?" GIRL!
I was honestly thinking about how I missed these yesterday. I’m glad you made this.
Link's attitude here was so funny 🤣 he wants to support his best friend but at the same time his best friend is crazy
I thoroughly enjoyed being apart of this
Rhett is a sexy guy.
I'm so happy this channel is back!!!
Alright Link is way more attractive than Keith Urban.
This vlog should've been titled "Helping Rhett Get Laid"
Jessie's reaction is so pure. I lose it when she wheezes.
Lmao. Worth the wait, I laughed out loud a lot.  Cheers y'all!
I hope that you have Jason as a guest on GMM so you can talk about this.
AFTER 8 MONTHS, A ACTUAL VIDEO
Rhett: No, it's  not about mom. It's about daddy. Jessie: 👁 。👁
Now we know why he has grown out his hair and beard😂
I didn’t know this video was coming and I’m happily surprised and very entertained! Hope the vlogs come back, even if irregularly, these are freaking brilliant! It oozes original R&L and so funny!
Hilarious * woke my wife up w historical laughter!
I encourage you Rhett.. And i give all the credit to Link.
jessie is literally so cute i love her
This was just wonderful!
I can so see how he fell for her from just these few moments, it’s lovely
Yay! I’ve missed the vlogs😁
Rhett squealing like a kid while getting hosed is the best thing ever.
So this is why you grew your hair in your beard out for so long
Alternate title: Aquaman... Aqua makes a man happy 😂
Too bad her celebrity crush isn't Sam Elliott...
"it ain't about mom it's about daddy" Rhett 2021
I think a safe bet is Momoa’s a Hall Pass for most wives, but sorry, Jessie and the others, I’m his HP... in my dreams! 😁 🤪 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
"why am I here" I ask myself that everyday.
This is such a nice surprise.
Me: I wanna go see Jason Momoa! Mom: We have Jason Momoa at home Jason Momoa at home:
Btw, it was totally worth the wait.
Low key this is the reason Rhett grew his hair out
OMG!!!! LMFAO!!!!!!!!!
So glad for the vlog. Hope they are coming regularly again.
And now we know why he has actually been growing out his hair what a lovely man 😂😂
Rhett and Jessie should start a vlogging channel together
Link is a million times more attractive than Keith Urban.
maybe 2021 won't be so bad after all
This episode was a pleasant surprise this morning ☺️
This was brilliant and a great thing to do for Jessie 🥰🤣
This is the best video ever, can't stop laughing
Link: "I don't love what this might be doing for his ego"   Awww. Link, we love you but this made it even more sweeter than it intended. You're so cute! 😍👀
We only lay each other😂😂😂😂 the back and forth of that between these two just highlights their friendship mayn😍😂😂👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼
Please upload more often! I miss these videos this was so funny!
I didn’t expect this today but I’m hyped
Rhett you are beautiful.
Jessie in a video, oh my Lord. Now, only if Christy makes an appearance too, I will be able to die in peace.
I sure hope they pay Jenna enough to do this...
I needed that today. Thanks guys. ♥️
Y’all talked about Link doing the knock and twist on bathroom doors that freaks people out on an Ear Biscuit... With the way he entered the room in the beginning, that’d freak me out too! 😂
14:48 "It ain't about mom. It's about daddy." LOL 😂😂
Hey, Vlogs are back!!!
I'd choose Rhett over Jason Mamoa everyday XD
Rhett you are better than him. And you hair is devine
Thank you so much for bringing this bavk
PLEASE MAKE THE VLOGS A REGULAR THING😭
We can all agree to some points : -Rhett's ego increased, it's now 105% -Jessie appreciates Momoa more now -We want to see Link do this
I didn't noticed that this was uploaded today. Caveman and Link.
They should do an episode where link shows us how he does laundry  ( day 17 of trying )
"Don't show me the hole." "That's why I have this towel on." Sneaky.
Happy Birthday to Jessie! It was nice to finally get to see her.  And now we know the real reason why Rhett keeps his beard and hair long LOL
I'm a Marvel guy too, but I highly suggest you check out Aquaman, Link! It's my favourite DC movie since The Dark Knight. Has very much of a globe-trotting adventure vibe, which is something I always love.
'I don't mind' "I know you don't mind because you're secure!" fragile masculinity who? rhett don't know her
Looks like that t-shirt isn't the only thing that got wet because of this video.
I would love to see movie videos like this!
JESSIE IS SO CUTE OH MY LORDDDDD
Hahahah that was awesome
i love these!!!! keep them coming yall are hilarious
I   L O V E     T H I S   !      M O R E     P L E A S E !
This is AWESOME..... My 30th birthday was yesterday (January 15th)!! So this is kinda like a present for me too!!! 🥳🎂🎉HAPPY BIRTHDAY JESSIE!!! 🎉🎂🥳
I love this ♡
Link, I'm one of those who isn't into Jason Momao. He is too muscular and has too much hair for my taste. I like lean, pale guys with floppy hair.
“Now make all your muscles bigger” 😂😂😂 A great comeback video
That's so sweet!
Oh look they're uploading on the forgotten channel
For link: Link we all truly love you for what you do for your best buddy rhett. You're an amazing friend & guy to do this. Don't forget the fact that maybe MAYBE in the next vlog, you'll probs be doing the same thing so.... 😂. ILY-Lizzy
The legends are back.
omg i love this so much 😂
Rhett is more handsome. fight me xD
I wish to state clearly that this video is making me laugh a lot and that I am enjoying it very much but that I am not encouraging Rhett with these words. Link - does that work?
I’ve missed these vlogs so much.🥰🥰
Jessie is too sweet and pure for us, we have been blessed
I love these vlogs and hope you guys do them more regularly! Mythical for life!
When was the last time you were paid? "BY HER??" Hol up 🤣rhetts a playa
This was the sweetest thing ever! Jesse is a lucky lady!
Amazing can't wait for more
i like the MOMOA FACE
I'm so here for this.
That was worth the wait!
Top notch content 👌
Jenna is smokinnnn
Now this is pure gold!
Hahahahaha
I think link needs to shower at Rhett's house....
SO MUCH LOVE AND RESPECT FOR JESSIE!!!! She is perfect and wonderful and everything to me.
Now I'm wondering what Jason Momoa looks like without a beard
Funniest and best moment of 2021 so far
i am delighted as i am envious
Keith Urban makes sense to me 😂
Wait the vlogs came back?
I'm so happy they uploaded again. Please keep uploading! I even prefer it more then the actual GMM show.
i can’t believe Link worked with Jason Momoa for an entire day and didn’t even bring Rhett
Now I am not at all into Jason but if I was to ever be stuck in a marriage with someome I would hope it would be to someone who would take this time for me . I 100% believe she loves that gift , because it's personal and so much work went into it. Its the most impressive gift I have seen someone give their wife on youtube.
I can't decide if I wish my boss would task me with "hey, come help me get some from my wife", or not.....so conflicted....
This is amazing 😊
That explains why Rhett grew his hair out great video guys!
Is this in the creative house?
Oh that's what Rhetts been doing with all that hair! I thought it was for a part in a show or something new, but didn't expect this fabulas idea!
Lhett and Rink
OK this was worth the wait
I’d like to see Link becoming Keith Urban...
Jessie is so freaking beautiful, she deserves all the love in the world.
Rhett looks great with that glasses
The reason Rhett has been growing out his hair is much more obvious now.
This is making me look forward to Saturday now!!! I'm happy to see this is back!!!
Can we talk about Jenna’s commitment to this? I love it 😂💜
these two are absolute couple goals, they are adorable!
Wait why is cosplaying Jason Momoa???   He already look like Jason Momoa
Their wives CLEARLY got a type!
LMAO I LOVE IT Link he will get over this
Poor Link 🤣
I wish more men would wear beard decorations, bands, beads, whatever. Love it!  I'm not encouraging Rhett! I'm praising Momoa. Lol
This is DEFINITELY a thirst trap. And im totally ok with it
I’m just here throwing my whole husband away as I got a kitchenaid for my bday. 😫😫
I'm not up to date with the news but didn't the vlogs become a Mythical Society exclusive thing? Or is it not anymore?
As a photographer the amount of times they've said "they can just photoshop that out" just gives me anxiety
My hall pass is Henry cavill 🥰
did I manifest this?? 👀👀👀
Keith Urban
THE VLOGS RETURN!!! I love Jessie omfg she is so cute 🥺🥺🥺
Jessie's reactions to "daddy" and "do to me as you please" had me in tears lmao.
Jessie is beautiful inside out. Adore her!! ❤❤❤❤
adorable
Happy Birthday Jessie!
Keith Urban. Haha
I’ve commented this before but Jenna is a Godsend 🙏🏼
I don't mind. "I know you don't cause you're secure, you're very secure" "That's right, keep going!" hahahaha
thicc
Wow Rhett's wife is pretty wish my gf looks that great when she reaches her age
Jessie is such a sweetheart, she and Rhett are exactly what I’m picturing for my future.
Rhett you look amazing as Jason. Very nice indeed. Your wife is a very luck lady
Jessie is a queen and we don't deserve her ❤
Holy shitake! Are they breaking the 'no wife showing' rule finally??!
When Rhett says "we lay each other" ,  I dont know why but my mind is picturing Rhett and his wife feeding chips to each other greek painting style.
Jessie is an absolute queen 😩💛
😂😂😂 Brilliant
yay!!!! welcome back to the vlogs!!!! missed them dearly
Glad to have a new vlog!!!     Worth the wait 😄
All I want in 2021 is a vlog introducing Link's cat starring Christy. Please please please!
but honestly, this WAS worth the wait, no question. i laughed so hard at so many places - link did his job.
I encourage Rhett.
Not Rhett lowkey flexing on getting laid well and often 😂
This is what you call wholesome
I absolutely love it best video link had me crying with his comments
Thank you thunder gods for waking me up so I could catch this new vlog!  This was so fun to watch.
YES YES YES VLOG! GOT EXCITED SINCE YALL MENTIONED THEYRE BACKKKK!!! just post whenever. its fine. no pressure, no rush!
So this is the reason why Rhett has been growing out his hair
"horse flesh"
#WHYAMIHERE
Aww! Happy Birthday, Jessie! 💙🥳
It was worth the wait! I love how Link hates every minute of this
I’m so happy the vlogs are back!!
Gasp, they're vlogging again!!! :)
Bringing back the vlog! Yeah! Lets hope its consistent now
MORE COWBELL!!! Link I love you!!
Imagine Sheperd's reaction to this
Link’s reaction during this was so funny 😹😹😹 happy birthday Jessie!
I’m just here waiting for the Link thirst trap video 👀
I want more of the assistant
Also, we joke. But he low key kinda killed it.
So damn cute!!!!
HAhaaaaaaaa! This is making me so happy , I'm saving it to watch slowly through my day! Lol 😆
Jason Mamoa wishes he was Rhett McLaughlin. 😍
This was a nice surprise
More cowbell!!
WE WANT TO BE APART OF THIS TOO RHETT!!!
Rhett Momoa lol - love their Saturday shows
we actually got to see jessie??? finally?? i've never been happier
Queen Jessie in the house!!! 😍
Well we finally know why Rhett grew his hair out.
That wasn't worth the wait.
Alternate title: Link roasted Rhett for not being muscular for 16 minutes
Thought they would start up their vlogs again after seeing their tweet. BLESS THIS!
So this is why Rhett has been growing his hair out...
link is so shady lmao "...lotta challenges with this one" 😂
He's pretty to me too
This is gold 😂
this was amazing ♡♡♡
I love her reaction
so much is understood now.. geez, Rhett, you have my sympathy
well taht was awesome. cool to see rhett's wife, too.
Hahhahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahah.        Excellent.      If you do some Keanu Reeves pictures send them my way - actually I will take the actual Keanu Reeves please
Link: "are you asking me to help you to make a thrist trap video?" LOL HAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHA
Rhett totally took the tattoo shirt home for his wife 😂
Easier to do face Recognition app! 😉
I like the fact that she would go out and do this for your wife I think you’re amazing for doing that. And you have a pretty wife she is lucky to have somebody like you and you’re lucky to have somebody like her have a blessed day
You guy's keep going with your vlog weekend video's I love them.
So interesting to see Link as a director
They’re Back babyyyyy hell yeah
Aww what a sweet and thoughtful gift! I'm sure you're much better than Jason in her eyes, because you're all hers (and pretty dang handsome yourself)! 😜😜😜
Imagine being the neighbors next door and all u hear and see are 2 grown men and their assistant setting up all these photo shoots. I’d prop a chair and a beer and just listen😂😂
2 MAN VLOGS ARE BACK?????
What a life.
niiice present!
Omg, you should have drawn your brows like Jason's Rhett!!! Man, what a miss!
yay i love these videos
This exact video but Link dresses up as Keith Urban PLEASSEE this was hilarious
Charles Mansoa
as much as i love momoa rhett, director link has my whole heart
Khal Damnyell. They're taking those tattoo shirts home, for sure.
Rhett McMoa!
A VLOG PLUS A MYTHICAL WIFE REVEALED???!!!
Hope Jason sees this. 😁
Please please do the Keith Urban version!!
Are the vlogs back?
omg love it!!!
this belongs on redtube  not here :)
Jenna is TOO precious 💜
The "cone necklace" is actually a pounamu. Greenstone (jade)
If Rhett has another kid  in 9 Months atleast we know the circumstances of its conception. All i am gonne say is "fur flaps"
Why the hell was this posted so late?
Now to see Link as Keith Urban...cant wait! Lol😉
Link: "I don't know photoshop" But surely he knows that a picture's worth a thousand words, so a few white lies can't hurt
I can’t wait for link’s transformation into Keith urban for his wife’s birthday 🤣
I bet Jessie loves that Rhett is growing out his hair with a celebrity crush like that.
Link: “So what’s the objective of this?” Rhett: “To make her want me.”    Pain.
Glad to see the vlogs are back
Greatest content creators
Now available at mythical store................
*encourages Rhett
Jessie you were absolutely wonderful!! And Rhett- I think McMomoa & Momoa are one of the same person👀. Nicely done.
That's the cutest
Jessie's reaction is everything! What a wonderful present!
Tinder vs reality
This is the greatest and most hilarious video I've ever watched.
hairline
Halfway through, this is everything I didn't know it could be! LOLLL loving this!  And Jessie on camera! 😱 Happy 2021 to us!! 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Glad ur back!
Lmfao that was great
So you finally figured out the password to your office computer huh...
“laid by her” HOW ELSE WAS YOUR SON BORN?!🤣
Finally a new one I cant believe it
New vlog
For a long time I was debating whether I should suggest to have a Rhett makeover into Wolverine from "Logan", let's see if this gets picked up
Link is hilarious.. he just says the best things and love cutting Rhett down a notch anytime he can 😂 love this video so much and I've always loved Jessie(&Rhett)😍
I guess Jason momoa dressed up as Rhett in aquaman
Rhett grows out his hair... i wonder why 😅
I MISSED THIS SO MUCH!!! I was laughing every second, I kid you not. My mom even had to check on me because I was laughing too much.  And to think Jessie's in the vlog as well! Belated Merry Christmas, I guess. And belated Happy Birthday to Jessie! <3 <3 <3
YES!Definitely worth the wait!couldn't stop laughing through the whole video...you guys are the Best!
That WAS worth the wait^^
You two make a great couple.
Hell I'm a straight man and I think my hall pass is Jason Momoa.
I miss these vlogs so much! and this was a great comeback
Epic
I love everything about this vlog 😂💚
Well worth the wait 😂
You're awesome Rhett! The reaction from Jessie was just incredible 😄
1:04 "I'm a marvel guy."
I think this is romantic to do for his wife but sidenote Link could probably pull off looking like his wife's hall pass
I’m so glad I happened to open YouTube rn I should be sleeping but......
"don't encourage him in the comments" like, out of the two, I think Link is the handsomest, but Rhett as Khal is doing some things to my stomach
Yay! Glad to see a vlog. Cute video your wife seems sweet with a great sense of humor!
Ty for making more of these vlogs :)
Yes finally Rhett and link is back I love these vlogs
This was great 😂👍🏻
Pov: you're so early you cant think of a pov
Soon as that camera turned off you know she went full Khaleesi on him
MORE JESSIE!!!!
I'm convinced Rhett and Jason Momoa are at least related
This is what real love looks like people
14:20 Get yourself a man that laughs like that when he sees you.
This is amazing gift!
Link the professional photographer
10:14  😂😂😂
I hope Mamoa sees this and sends Jessie a message! Also, Yall catch the part where Rhett said he's actually got Jason Mamoa to come over for his wife?!!! lol
Jessie is soooo lucky. Hot damn. 😍
Is Rhett the new King of Atlantis?       Let’s talk about that.
We love Jessie McLaughlin
If this means we get more vlogs, you can bet I'm going to encourage Rhett
JESSIE JESSIE JESSIE ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Yesss finally another vlogg 😍
Jessie is such an angel. And we have the same celeb hall pass ❤️❤️🥺
It has been 252 days since the last vlog...and this vlog was definitely worth the wait!!!
SUUUUPPPPEEEER LOVEEEELYYYY💞💕💞💞💕💞
Jessie is an absolute Queen
The resemblance is unncanny
YES VLOGS😍😍😍😍
THEY ARE BACK! And it was hilarious 😆
✨✨Jessie showing us how she has the best taste! And the best laugh! 👑 ✨✨
THIS 👏🏽WAS👏🏽 WORTH👏🏽 THE 👏🏽WAIT!!!!!  This was so precious and wholesome.
Queen Jessie is an icon 💖
this is my dream come true
Guess who remembered their password
my cheeks hurt from smiling, they’re so cute😭😭🥰
The book came out nice
jessie has the greatest laugh ever
YAY THEY ARE UPLOADING IN THIS CHANNEL AGAIN!!
I was wondering what happened to this channel and when they we're going to upload something.
That was the best vlog ever! Jessie is so sweet and her laugh is just 🥰
I opened YouTube hoping to watch GMM and remembered damn it's Saturday there's no new episode and then I see this and just yes
JESSIEEEEEE. This woman is my spirit animal.
Mmmmckay that was kinda weird...
If my husband doesn’t make me a book of him dressed as my hall pass...imma trade him in for an upgraded Rhett version.
there’s our queen jessie!!!🤩🤩🤩welcome back boys!
I was on a tangent of R&L vlogs this morning, and I come to the channel and they’ve uploaded a new one? I’m blessed
Why is Luigi helping out Jason Momoa doing pictures?
It’s back and Jessie are u kidding me?!
Not to encourage him. But the wet T-shirt portion.
Jessie deserves everything 🙌
welcome back vlog boys we love you
And it's finally happened, they're back here! I'll be honest I needed this. I've been really down lately and it's been hard for anything to pull me up for a second. R&L will always pull me up, even if I'm down again right after.
omg seeing jessie so happy made my daaaaaaay
They protect They atacc But most importantly, Mythical vlogs are bacc
Rhett Momoa is one sexy man, daymn
This explains the hair and beard
That was worth the wait.
We love Jessie McLaughlin! That is all.
Never smiled so dang hard in my life. What a great video❤️
They're back!!!!
FINALLY, A FREAKIN VLOG
I can confirm that this was worth the wait
JESSIE'S PRESENCE MAKES ME SO HAPPY
I felt a lot of "Love In The Air" between Rhett & Jessie. That was a very nice gift!! Happy Birthday Jessie!! 💐
rhett could have really replicated skinny Momoa in that super bowl ad a lot better
Is this the reason he has been growing his hair and beard so long ?
Pog
Wow! How did you guys invite Jason? And where is Rhett?
Nice
Please please do this w Link as Keith Urban next vid? 🤞🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🤞🏽
I love how Link is constantly but lovingly roasting Rhett 😂
This was golden! I love Jessie so much!
love it!
Can we all take a moment to appreciate how beautiful Jesse is
Naw bru she for th......
I love the vlogs so much, seriously. Keep them up if it's possible, we love seeing how quirky and wholesome you are in your real lives
I love you Jessie! Hopefully you're not reading the comments like Rhett advised, but in case you are I wanted you to see something nice! You're amazing and it's so much fun seeing you unblurred haha 😂 This is a perfect debut! ❤
Happy Birthday Jessie 😊
Lets gooo the vlogs are back!!!
"don't encourage him in the comments"  *slowly deletes poem*
For Halloween this year Rhett should dress up as Khal Drogo and Jessie as Daenerys 🐉
So u would let u wife cheat on u with the actor if she could
Rhett's face when he tries to smile is legitimately terrifying.
Finally! Jesse has revealed herself
Who would have thought that the most difficult part of recreating Jason Momoa would be the smile
It's been awhile 🤧🤧
Tears in my eyes laughing at Rhett and Link's conversation about laying. 😂😂
Can’t wait to see what Jessie gets Rhett for his birthday
lol
Wow this is finally back !!
I missed this
Whett McLaughlin
Rhett and Link's love for their wives are couple goals🥰
VLOGS ARE BACK LESSGOO!!
Rhett looks like the leader of a yoga cult in that pink outfit.
That was worth the wait
THE VLOGS ARE BACKKKK!! I guess 2021 really is looking up
"....depends on how thirsty they are" Link's look had me ROLLING
Jason mamoa, putting all other men to shame but we’re ok with it cause the dude is awesome... go ahead have my wife for the day

Its so cool to get to see Jessie!! Its honestly strange knowing that they have a life beyond YouTube, but awesome nonetheless
IS THIS WHY YOU'VE BEEN GROWING OUT YOUR HAIR RHETT!!??
Are you telling me Jessie doesn't actually have a pixelated face?
Link: When’s the last time you were laid? Rhett: By her? WHO ELSE RHETT
2021 is gonna be so much better now! I just know 😭
Link could definitely be a Keith Urban
